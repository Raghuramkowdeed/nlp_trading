MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE EDUCATION, CREATIVE, CONSUMER, AND BUSINESS MARKETS. APPLE CUSTOMERS ARE ATTRACTED TO MACINTOSH COMPUTERS FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS,

INCLUDING THE REDUCED AMOUNT OF TRAINING RESULTING FROM THE MACINTOSH COMPUTER'S INTUITIVE EASE OF USE, ADVANCED GRAPHICS CAPABILITIES, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN FEATURES OF THE COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS,

AND ABILITY OF MACINTOSH COMPUTERS TO NETWORK AND COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTS. APPLE PERSONAL COMPUTERS WERE FIRST INTRODUCED TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE LATE 1970S.

OVER 16% OF THE COMPANY'S NET SALES IN 2004 WERE THROUGH ITS U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL, INCLUDING SALES TO ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS.

THE

COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS AND CATALOGUERS. NO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF NET SALES IN 2004, 2003 OR

$3.9 BILLION, $2.9 BILLION, AND $2.4 BILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

COMPETITION

THE COMPANY IS CONFRONTED BY AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION IN ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THE MARKET FOR THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND SALE OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED SOFTWARE

AND PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THIS MARKET CONTINUES TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, WHICH HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED

THE CAPABILITIES AND APPLICATIONS OF THESE PRODUCTS, AND HAVE RESULTED IN THE FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SIGNIFICANT PRICE,

13

FEATURE,

AND PERFORMANCE COMPETITION. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, PRICE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE. THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS WHO SELL PERSONAL

COMPUTERS BASED ON OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED THEIR PRODUCT MARGINS TO GAIN OR MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE AND OTHER INDUSTRY-WIDE DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON GROSS MARGINS.

THE

PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS INCLUDE RELATIVE PRICE/PERFORMANCE, PRODUCT QUALITY AND RELIABILITY, DESIGN INNOVATION, AVAILABILITY OF SOFTWARE, PRODUCT

FEATURES, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITY, SERVICE AND SUPPORT, AVAILABILITY OF HARDWARE PERIPHERALS, AND CORPORATE REPUTATION. FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS PLACE

MORE

RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT ARE SMALLER, SIMPLER, AND LESS EXPENSIVE THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH THE COMPANY'S

EXISTING PRODUCTS.

THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY TAKING AND WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS TO RESPOND TO THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES BEING PLACED ON ITS PERSONAL COMPUTER SALES AS A RESULT OF INNOVATIONS IN COMPETING PLATFORMS.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PERCEIVED

FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN ADVANTAGES OVER COMPETING PLATFORMS.

THE

COMPANY'S INITIAL SUCCESS WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN END-TO-END MUSIC OFFERING, WHICH INCLUDES THE ITUNES SOFTWARE, ITUNES MUSIC STORE AND IPOD DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYER, HAS

ALREADY ENCOURAGED SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN THIS AREA FROM OTHER COMPANIES, MANY OF WHOM HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, MARKETING, AND MANUFACTURING RESOURCES THAN THOSE OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

ANTICIPATES THAT COMPETITION WILL INTENSIFY REQUIRING THE COMPANY TO RESPOND AS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND CONTENT PROVIDERS WORK MORE COLLABORATIVELY TO OFFER INTEGRATED PRODUCTS THAT COMPETE AGAINST THE

COMPANY'S OFFERINGS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT MAINTAINS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BY MORE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATING THE ENTIRE END-TO-END MUSIC SOLUTION, INCLUDING THE HARDWARE

(IPOD), SOFTWARE (ITUNES) AND DISTRIBUTION OF THIRD-PARTY MUSIC CONTENT (ITUNES MUSIC STORE).

RAW MATERIALS

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND

APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ("ASICS")) ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME OTHER KEY COMPONENTS, WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM

MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY WIDE AVAILABILITY CONSTRAINTS AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER

THERE IS A NEED FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY OR SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT TO THE COMPANY WERE TO BE DELAYED OR CURTAILED OR IN THE EVENT A KEY

MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYS SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SHIP RELATED PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE

COMPANY DID EXPERIENCE SUCH DELAYS DURING FISCAL 2004, WHICH RESULTED IN THE CONSTRAINED AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF

THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY

ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE POTENTIAL RISKS BY WORKING CLOSELY WITH THESE AND OTHER KEY SUPPLIERS ON PRODUCT INTRODUCTION PLANS, STRATEGIC INVENTORIES, COORDINATED PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND INTERNAL

AND EXTERNAL MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES AND LEVELS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF FORMAL PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER

14

CONTRACTS,

AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 130 DAYS.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHOSE LOSS TO THE COMPANY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

AT THIS TIME, SUCH VENDORS INCLUDE AGERE SYSTEMS, INC., AMBIT MICROSYSTEMS CORPORATION, ASUSTEK CORPORATION, ATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC., BROADCOM CORPORATION, FREESCALE

SEMICONDUCTOR, INC. (FORMERLY THE SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS SEGMENT OF MOTOROLA, INC.), HITACHI GLOBAL STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES, HON HAI PRECISION INDUSTRY CO., LTD., IBM CORPORATION,

INTERNATIONAL DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY, INVENTEC APPLIANCES CORPORATION, LG. PHILLIPS CO., LTD., MATSUSHITA, MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC CORPORATION, NVIDIA CORP., PORTAL PLAYER, INC., QUANTA

COMPUTER, INC., SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS, SYNAPTICS, INC., AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

BECAUSE THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO

ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY FLOW OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO

DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND TO ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS IN THE AREAS OF HARDWARE AND PERIPHERALS, CONSUMER ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS, SYSTEM SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE, NETWORKING AND

COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE AND SOLUTIONS, AND THE INTERNET. THE COMPANY MAY EXPAND THE RANGE OF ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THROUGH LICENSING AND/OR ACQUISITION OF THIRD-PARTY

BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY. THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES TOTALED $489 MILLION, $471 MILLION, AND $446 MILLION IN 2004, 2003, AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

$30 MILLION, AND $8 MILLION WERE RECOGNIZED IN 2004, 2003, 2002, AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2000, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THE COST OF A SPECIAL EXECUTIVE BONUS FOR THE COMPANY'S CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR PAST SERVICES IN THE FORM OF AN AIRCRAFT WITH A TOTAL COST TO THE COMPANY OF APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION. IN 2002, OF THE ORIGINAL $90 MILLION ACCRUAL,

$2 MILLION REMAINED UNSPENT AND WAS REVERSED. IN 2003, SETTLEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S FORWARD STOCK PURCHASE AGREEMENT RESULTED IN A GAIN OF $6 MILLION. FAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT TYPE

ADJUSTMENTS, NET OF TAXES, OF $1 MILLION AND $12 MILLION WERE RECOGNIZED IN 2003 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

EXECUTIVE OVERVIEW

APPLE DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED SOFTWARE, SERVICES, PERIPHERALS AND NETWORKING SOLUTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO DESIGNS, DEVELOPS AND MARKETS

A LINE OF PORTABLE DIGITAL MUSIC

23

PLAYERS

ALONG WITH RELATED ACCESSORIES AND SERVICES INCLUDING THE ONLINE DISTRIBUTION OF THIRD-PARTY MUSIC AND AUDIO BOOKS. THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE THE MACINTOSH LINE OF DESKTOP

AND NOTEBOOK COMPUTERS, THE IPOD DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYER, THE XSERVE SERVER AND XSERVE RAID STORAGE PRODUCTS, A PORTFOLIO OF CONSUMER AND PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, THE MAC OS X

OPERATING SYSTEM, THE ONLINE ITUNES MUSIC STORE, A PORTFOLIO OF PERIPHERALS THAT SUPPORT AND ENHANCE THE MACINTOSH AND IPOD PRODUCT LINES, AND A VARIETY OF OTHER SERVICE AND SUPPORT OFFERINGS. THE

COMPANY SELLS ITS PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES, ITS OWN RETAIL STORES, ITS DIRECT SALES FORCE, AND THIRD-PARTY WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS AND VALUE ADDED RESELLERS. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY SELLS A VARIETY OF THIRD-PARTY MACINTOSH COMPATIBLE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING COMPUTER PRINTERS AND PRINTING SUPPLIES, STORAGE DEVICES, COMPUTER MEMORY, DIGITAL VIDEO AND STILL CAMERAS, PERSONAL

DIGITAL ASSISTANTS, AND VARIOUS OTHER COMPUTING PRODUCTS AND SUPPLIES THROUGH ITS ONLINE AND RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANY SELLS TO EDUCATION, CONSUMER, CREATIVE PROFESSIONAL, BUSINESS AND GOVERNMENT

CUSTOMERS. A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS DOCUMENT UNDER THE HEADING "BUSINESS."

THE

COMPANY'S BUSINESS STRATEGY LEVERAGES ITS UNIQUE ABILITY, THROUGH THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF ITS OWN OPERATING SYSTEM, HARDWARE AND MANY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES, TO BRING TO ITS

CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD COMPELLING NEW PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS WITH SUPERIOR EASE-OF-USE, SEAMLESS INTEGRATION AND INNOVATIVE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN.

THE

COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN SEVERAL HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS, INCLUDING PERSONAL COMPUTERS WITH ITS MACINTOSH LINE OF COMPUTERS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS WITH ITS IPOD LINE OF DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS AND

DISTRIBUTION OF THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL MUSIC THROUGH ITS ONLINE ITUNES MUSIC STORE. WHILE THE COMPANY IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS AN INNOVATOR IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET AS WELL AS A LEADER IN THE

EMERGING MARKET FOR DISTRIBUTION OF DIGITAL MUSIC, THESE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE PRICING AND INCREASED COMPETITION. IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) IS NECESSARY IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN AND EXTEND ITS POSITION IN THE MARKETS WHERE IT COMPETES. THE COMPANY'S R&D SPENDING IS FOCUSED

ON DELIVERING TIMELY UPDATES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO ITS EXISTING LINE OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS, DISPLAYS, OPERATING SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND PORTABLE MUSIC PLAYERS; DEVELOPING NEW DIGITAL

LIFESTYLE CONSUMER AND PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS; AND INVESTING IN NEW PRODUCT AREAS SUCH AS RACK-MOUNT SERVERS, RAID STORAGE SYSTEMS, AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES A VARIETY OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SALES OF ITS INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS ARE ENHANCED BY KNOWLEDGEABLE SALESPERSONS

WHO CAN CONVEY THE VALUE OF THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERAL INTEGRATION, DEMONSTRATE THE UNIQUE DIGITAL LIFESTYLE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE ONLY ON MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, AND DEMONSTRATE THE

SEAMLESS

COMPATIBILITY OF THE MACINTOSH WITH THE WINDOWS PLATFORM AND NETWORKS. THE COMPANY FURTHER BELIEVES THAT PROVIDING A HIGH-QUALITY SALES AND AFTER-SALES SUPPORT EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO

ATTRACTING AND RETAINING CUSTOMERS. TO ENSURE A HIGH-QUALITY BUYING EXPERIENCE FOR ITS PRODUCTS IN WHICH SERVICE AND EDUCATION ARE EMPHASIZED, THE COMPANY HAS EXPANDED AND IMPROVED ITS

DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES BY OPENING ITS OWN RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY. THE COMPANY HAD 86 STORES OPEN AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004.

THE

COMPANY HAS ALSO STAFFED SELECTED THIRD-PARTY STORES WITH THE COMPANY'S OWN EMPLOYEES TO IMPROVE THE BUYING EXPERIENCE THROUGH RESELLER CHANNELS. THE COMPANY HAS DEPLOYED APPLE EMPLOYEES IN

RESELLER LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING THE U.S., EUROPE, JAPAN AND AUSTRALIA. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS TO CUSTOMERS DIRECT THROUGH ONE OF ITS ONLINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD.

TO

IMPROVE THE ACCESSIBILITY OF ITS IPOD PRODUCT LINE, THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE NUMBER OF DISTRIBUTION POINTS WHERE IPODS ARE SOLD. THE IPOD PRODUCT LINE CAN NOW BE PURCHASED IN

DEPARTMENT STORES, DISCOUNT STORES AND SPECIALTY MUSIC AND AUDIO-VISUAL STORES.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THE COMPANY'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REQUIRE THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED

IN THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE

CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE

MATERIAL.

MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, INVENTORY VALUATION AND EXPOSURES RELATED TO

INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES, WARRANTY COSTS, AND INCOME TAXES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THESE POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL BECAUSE

THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THE

COMPANY'S SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS (I.E., HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND PERIPHERALS), AND EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES REVENUE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, INCLUDING STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) NO. 97-2,

SOFTWARE REVENUE

RECOGNITION

, AS AMENDED, AND SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 104,

REVENUE

RECOGNITION.

THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED

DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED, AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS

SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE

COMPANY LEGALLY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. IF AT THE OUTSET OF AN ARRANGEMENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS NOT, OR IS PRESUMED NOT TO BE,

FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED AS AMOUNTS BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE.

THE

COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING RESELLER AND END-USER REBATES, AND OTHER

SALES PROGRAMS AND VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES. THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS ACCRUED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE IN THE PERIOD THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT AND COMMITTED TO A PLAN. THE

COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT TRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO

INCREASE CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND INCUR INCREMENTAL PRICE PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE AT THE TIME SUCH PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED. ADDITIONALLY,

CERTAIN CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY REDEEM THE INCENTIVE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS

OF PARTICULAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IF A GREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF CUSTOMERS REDEEM SUCH INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, WHICH COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

25

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATION, CONSUMER, AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE

COLLATERAL FROM ITS CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER, WHEN POSSIBLE THE COMPANY DOES ATTEMPT TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK ON TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CREDIT INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN LATIN AMERICA, EUROPE AND ASIA

AND BY ARRANGING WITH

THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES TO PROVIDE FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER LOAN AND LEASE PROGRAMS TO THE COMPANY'S DIRECT CUSTOMERS. THESE CREDIT-FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE

THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANY AND THE END CUSTOMER. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RECOURSE OR CREDIT RISK SHARING RELATED TO ANY OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER, CONSIDERABLE TRADE

RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL, THIRD-PARTY FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS, OR CREDIT INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS.

THE

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS IS BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AND INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF THE CREDIT WORTHINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

OF THOSE SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE THE SPECIFIC RECEIVABLES TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS REASONABLY BELIEVED TO BE COLLECTIBLE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE FOR

ALL OTHER TRADE RECEIVABLES BASED ON MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH BAD DEBTS, THE GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS,

AND THE AGING OF SUCH RECEIVABLES. IF THERE IS A DETERIORATION OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, IF THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF A

MAJOR CUSTOMER, OR IF FUTURE ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON TRADE RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, WHICH

WOULD AFFECT EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.

INVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF

COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED

REVIEW OF INVENTORY EACH PERIOD THAT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. THE

PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO A RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT AND COMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE AND DEMAND CHANGES. IF FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE

LESS FAVORABLE THAN FORECASTED OR IF UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE UTILITY OF COMPONENT INVENTORY, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS WHICH WOULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE WRITE-DOWNS ARE RECORDED.

THE

COMPANY ACCRUES NECESSARY RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO COMPONENT ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A

COMBINATION OF FORMAL PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. THESE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM

30 TO 130 DAYS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS OR AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE

COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION FEES THAT WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE CANCELLATION FEES ARE IDENTIFIED.

VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF SUCH AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF THESE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF THEIR CARRYING AMOUNT TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE.

IF SUCH ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS EQUALS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF

26

THE

ASSETS EXCEEDS THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED NO MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO ITS PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT OR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES DURING THE

PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS, EXCEPT THOSE MADE IN CONJUNCTION WITH RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, DETERIORATION IN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IN A GEOGRAPHIC REGION OR BUSINESS SEGMENT IN THE FUTURE, INCLUDING

DETERIORATION IN THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL RETAIL STORES, COULD LEAD TO SUCH IMPAIRMENT ADJUSTMENTS IN FUTURE PERIODS IN WHICH SUCH BUSINESS ISSUES ARE IDENTIFIED.

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

, THE COMPANY PERFORMS A

REVIEW OF GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, OR EARLIER IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST. THE REVIEW OF GOODWILL FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND REQUIRES THAT.

(1) GOODWILL BE ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS TO WHICH IT RELATES; (2) THE COMPANY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE REPORTING UNITS TO WHICH THE GOODWILL

RELATES; AND (3) THE COMPANY DETERMINE THE BOOK VALUE OF THOSE REPORTING UNITS. IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF REPORTING UNITS WITH ALLOCATED GOODWILL IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN THEIR BOOK

VALUE, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THOSE REPORTING UNITS IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO A PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION FOR AN ACQUIRED

BUSINESS. THIS REQUIRES INDEPENDENT VALUATION OF CERTAIN INTERNALLY DEVELOPED AND UNRECOGNIZED ASSETS INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY. ONCE THIS

PROCESS IS COMPLETE, THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, CAN BE DETERMINED.

BASED

ON THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004 THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL. HOWEVER, CHANGES IN VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S MARKET

CAPITALIZATION, CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S FORECASTS, AND CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL BUSINESS STRUCTURE COULD CAUSE ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S REPORTING UNITS TO BE VALUED DIFFERENTLY THEREBY

CAUSING AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL. ADDITIONALLY, IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND CHANGES IN GLOBAL OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE COMPANY MAY STRATEGICALLY REALIGN

ITS RESOURCES AND CONSIDER RESTRUCTURING, DISPOSING, OR OTHERWISE EXITING BUSINESSES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES, OR GOODWILL.

WARRANTY COSTS

THE COMPANY PROVIDES CURRENTLY FOR THE ESTIMATED COST FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM

RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY'S TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. EACH QUARTER, THE COMPANY

REEVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION, AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS

NECESSARY. IF ACTUAL PRODUCT FAILURE RATES OR REPAIR COSTS DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITY WOULD BE REQUIRED AND COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY RECORDS A TAX PROVISION FOR THE ANTICIPATED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

, THE

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX

CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED

TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE

DEFERRED TAX

27

LIABILITIES,

WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT ALL OR PART OF THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE DETERMINED NOT TO BE REALIZABLE IN THE FUTURE, AN

ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. SIMILARLY, IF THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY REALIZES DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY

DETERMINED TO BE UNREALIZABLE, THE RESPECTIVE VALUATION ALLOWANCE WOULD BE REVERSED, RESULTING IN A POSITIVE ADJUSTMENT TO EARNINGS OR A DECREASE IN GOODWILL IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAWS. RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN A

MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

FISCAL YEAR 2004 VERSUS 2003

DURING FISCAL 2004, NET SALES INCREASED 33% OR $2.1 BILLION FROM FISCAL 2003. SEVERAL FACTORS HAVE CONTRIBUTED FAVORABLY TO NET SALES DURING 2004.



NET

SALES OF MACINTOSH SYSTEMS INCREASED $432 MILLION OR 10% DURING FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 WHILE NET SALES PER MACINTOSH UNIT SOLD REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT ON A

YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS. UNIT SALES OF MACINTOSH SYSTEMS INCREASED 278,000 UNITS OR 9% DURING FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. THESE INCREASES IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES WERE A

RESULT OF STRONG DEMAND FOR ALL OF THE COMPANY'S MACINTOSH SYSTEMS, EXCEPT FOR THE IMAC. THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE SYSTEMS, CONSISTING OF THE POWERBOOK AND IBOOK, PRODUCED THE STRONGEST REVENUE AND UNIT

GROWTH DURING FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 OF APPROXIMATELY 26% AND 33%, RESPECTIVELY. UNIT SALES OF PORTABLE SYSTEMS ACCOUNTED FOR 51% OF ALL MACINTOSH SYSTEMS SOLD DURING FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO

ONLY 42% DURING 2003. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE RESULTS REFLECT AN OVERALL TREND IN THE INDUSTRY TOWARDS PORTABLE SYSTEMS. PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY'S POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS ALSO YIELDED

POSITIVE RESULTS IN FISCAL 2004, INCLUDING A 15% AND 6% INCREASE IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN YEAR-TO-DATE POWER MACINTOSH SALES IS DUE PRIMARILY

TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE POWER MAC G5, WHICH BEGAN SHIPPING AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003. ALTHOUGH POWER MACINTOSH SALES HAVE INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, SALES OF THIS PRODUCT WERE CONSTRAINED IN

THE SECOND HALF OF 2004 AS A RESULT OF MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS AT IBM, THE COMPANY'S SOLE SUPPLIER OF THE POWERPC G5 PROCESSOR.



NET

SALES OF IPODS ROSE $961 MILLION OR 279% DURING FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. UNIT SALES OF IPODS TOTALED 4.4 MILLION IN FISCAL 2004, WHICH REPRESENTS AN

INCREASE OF 370% FROM THE 939,000 IPOD UNITS SOLD IN FISCAL 2003. STRONG DEMAND FOR THE IPODS DURING FISCAL 2004 CONTINUED TO BE

29

EXPERIENCED

IN ALL OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS AND WAS DRIVEN BY ENHANCEMENTS TO THE IPOD, THE INTRODUCTION OF THE IPOD MINI, INCREASED EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY'S IPOD DISTRIBUTION NETWORK,

AND CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THE ITUNES MUSIC STORE DUE LARGELY TO MAKING IT AVAILABLE TO BOTH MACINTOSH AND WINDOWS USERS IN THE U.S., U.K., FRANCE AND GERMANY. SINCE INCEPTION OF THE IPOD PRODUCT LINE

IN FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANY HAS SOLD APPROXIMATELY 5.7 MILLION IPODS.



THE

RETAIL SEGMENT'S NET SALES GREW 91% TO $1.2 BILLION DURING FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. THIS INCREASE IS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN TOTAL STORES

FROM 65 AT THE END OF 2003 TO 86 AT THE END OF 2004, AS WELL AS A 36% YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE. WHILE THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS IN AREAS WHERE THE

RETAIL SEGMENT HAS OPENED STORES MAY ELECT TO PURCHASE FROM THE RETAIL SEGMENT STORES RATHER THAN THE COMPANY'S PREEXISTING SALES CHANNELS IN THE U.S. AND JAPAN, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S NET SALES IS INCREMENTAL TO THE COMPANY'S TOTAL NET SALES. SEE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BELOW RELATED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT UNDER THE HEADING "SEGMENT OPERATING

PERFORMANCE."



NET

SALES OF PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE ROSE BY 38% DURING FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET SALES OF DISPLAYS AND OTHER COMPUTER

ACCESSORIES. NET SALES OF OTHER COMPUTER ACCESSORIES INCLUDE AIRPORT CARDS AND BASE STATIONS, ISIGHT DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERAS, AND THIRD PARTY HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL NET SALES OF

PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE IS RELATED TO THE OVERALL INCREASE IN MACINTOSH UNIT SALES AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW AND UPDATED PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS AND WAS EXPERIENCED PREDOMINANTLY BY THE COMPANY'S

AMERICAS, EUROPE, AND RETAIL SEGMENTS.



OTHER

MUSIC PRODUCTS CONSISTS OF SALES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ITUNES MUSIC STORE AND IPOD RELATED SERVICES AND ACCESSORIES. NET SALES OF OTHER MUSIC PRODUCTS INCREASED

$242 MILLION OR 672% DURING FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED STRONG GROWTH IN SALES OF IPOD SERVICES AND ACCESSORIES CONSISTENT WITH THE INCREASE IN OVERALL IPOD UNIT

SALES FOR FISCAL 2004. THE INCREASED SALES FROM THE ITUNES MUSIC STORE, WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED IN APRIL 2003, IS PRIMARILY DUE TO MAKING THE STORE AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS IN

OCTOBER 2003 AND THE INTRODUCTION OF THE STORE IN THE U.K., FRANCE, AND GERMANY IN JUNE 2004.



NET

SALES OF SOFTWARE ROSE $140 MILLION OR 39% DURING FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER NET SALES OF THE COMPANY'S APPLE-BRANDED SOFTWARE AND IN

PARTICULAR, HIGHER NET SALES OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE, MAC OS X VERSION 10.3 "PANTHER," WHICH WAS RELEASED

IN OCTOBER 2003. NET SALES OF PANTHER ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY $74 MILLION OR OVER 50% OF THE INCREASE IN SOFTWARE NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003.



THE

COMPANY'S U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL EXPERIENCED YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN NET SALES OF APPROXIMATELY 19% FOR FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. UNIT SALES

ALSO INCREASED BY 10% DURING FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. THE INCREASE IN U.S. EDUCATION NET SALES FOR FISCAL 2004 RELATES PRIMARILY TO A 40% YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN HIGHER

EDUCATION NET SALES AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THE COMPANY'S 3% GROWTH IN K-12 NET SALES.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THE U.S. K-12 EDUCATION MARKET REMAINS CHALLENGING DUE TO MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING FUNDING PRESSURES DUE TO WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, LARGE BUDGET DEFICITS IN MANY

STATES, AND INCREASED COMPETITION PARTICULARLY FOR DESKTOP COMPUTERS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN STEPS, AND WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS, TO ADDRESS WEAKNESS IN THE U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL, IT

REMAINS DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE WHEN AND IF THIS TREND WILL REVERSE.



SERVICE

AND OTHER SALES INCREASED $37 MILLION OR 13% DURING FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. THESE INCREASES ARE THE RESULT OF SIGNIFICANT

YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN NET SALES ASSOCIATED WITH APPLECARE PROTECTION PLAN (APP) EXTENDED MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES, AS WELL AS INCREASES IN NET SALES ASSOCIATED

WITH THE COMPANY'S .MAC INTERNET SERVICE. INCREASED NET SALES ASSOCIATED WITH APP ARE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER MACINTOSH UNIT SALES AND HIGHER ATTACH RATES ON APP OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS.

30

OFFSETTING THE FAVORABLE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY'S NET SALES DURING FISCAL 2004 WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE FOLLOWING.



NET

SALES AND UNIT SALES OF IMAC SYSTEMS WERE DOWN 23% AND 16%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING FISCAL 2004 VERSUS 2003. THE DECREASE IN IMAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES WAS LARGELY DUE

TO THE DELAY IN THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW IMAC, BASED ON THE POWERPC G5 PROCESSOR, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY IBM. THE DELAYS IN THE NEW IMAC RESULTED IN THE

DEPLETION OF INVENTORY OF THE OLD IMAC FLAT PANEL PRIOR TO AVAILABILITY OF THE NEW IMAC G5. THE OLD FLAT PANEL IMAC FORM FACTOR WHICH WAS AVAILABLE DURING MOST OF FISCAL 2004, WAS NEARLY

3 YEARS OLD BY THE TIME THE NEW IMAC G5 BEGAN SHIPPING IN SEPTEMBER 2004 AND HAD EXPERIENCED DECLINES IN SALES AS A RESULT OF THE AGE OF THIS PRODUCT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SALES OF

IMAC SYSTEMS HAVE ALSO DECLINED DUE TO A SHIFT IN CONSUMER PREFERENCE TO PORTABLE SYSTEMS AND COMPETITOR DESKTOP MODELS WITH PRICE POINTS BELOW $1,000. THE COMPANY INTRODUCED A NEW VERSION OF THE EMAC

IN APRIL 2004 WITH A SUGGESTED RETAIL PRICE STARTING AT $799 AIMED AT THE PRICE SENSITIVE CUSTOMER.



NET

SALES AND UNIT SALES IN THE COMPANY'S JAPAN SEGMENT DECREASED 3% AND 14%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING FISCAL 2004 VERSUS 2003. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE DECLINES RELATE TO A

SHIFT IN SALES FROM THE JAPAN SEGMENT TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT AS A RESULT OF THE TOKYO AND OSAKA STORE OPENINGS IN FISCAL 2004. DECLINES IN JAPAN MAY ALSO RELATE TO DELAYS IN COMPUTER UPGRADES BY

CERTAIN PROFESSIONAL AND CREATIVE CUSTOMERS PENDING RELEASE IN JAPAN OF CERTAIN MAC OS X NATIVE APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS QUARK XPRESS 6, WHICH DID NOT BECOME AVAILABLE UNTIL

SEPTEMBER 2004. WHEN SALES FROM THE JAPAN RETAIL STORES ARE INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS FOR THE JAPAN SEGMENT, THE COMBINED REVENUE IN JAPAN RESULTED IN A 3% YEAR-OVER-YEAR

INCREASE IN FISCAL 2004 AS COMPARED TO 2003. SEE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BELOW RELATED TO THE JAPAN SEGMENT UNDER THE HEADING "SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE."

FISCAL YEAR 2003 VERSUS 2002

NET SALES INCREASED $465 MILLION OR 8% DURING 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 WHILE MACINTOSH UNIT SALES DECLINED 3% YEAR-OVER-YEAR TO APPROXIMATELY

3 MILLION UNITS IN 2003. SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED FAVORABLY TO NET SALES DURING 2003 INCLUDING.



THE

RETAIL SEGMENT'S NET SALES GREW TO $621 MILLION DURING 2003 FROM $283 MILLION IN 2002, AN INCREASE OF 119%. WHILE THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE ELECTED

TO PURCHASE PRODUCT FROM THEIR LOCAL APPLE RETAIL STORE RATHER THAN THROUGH OTHER PREEXISTING SALES CHANNELS IN THE U.S., THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S NET

SALES WAS INCREMENTAL TO TOTAL NET SALES. SEE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BELOW RELATED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT UNDER THE HEADING "SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE."



NET

SALES OF IPODS ROSE $202 MILLION OR 141% DURING 2003 COMPARED TO 2002. THIS INCREASE WAS EXPERIENCED BY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS. IPOD SALES DURING

2003 WERE FAVORABLY AFFECTED BY THE INTRODUCTION OF SUBSTANTIALLY REDESIGNED NEW MODELS, WHICH WERE COMPATIBLE WITH BOTH MACINTOSH AND WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS. THE COMPANY'S IPOD DIGITAL MUSIC

PLAYER IS SOLD BY A VARIETY OF RESELLERS, MANY OF WHICH DO NOT CURRENTLY MARKET THE COMPANY'S MACINTOSH SYSTEMS. THE COMPANY EXPANDED THIS DISTRIBUTION NETWORK DURING 2003, WHICH CONTRIBUTED TO THE

2003 INCREASE IN IPOD UNIT SALES OF 146%.



THE

COMPANY ALSO EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN NET SALES OF PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE TOTALING $164 MILLION OR 31% DURING 2003 COMPARED TO 2002, REFLECTING AN

OVERALL INCREASE IN NET SALES OF OTHER COMPUTER ACCESSORIES INCLUDING AIRPORT CARDS AND BASE STATIONS, WHICH FACILITATE WIRELESS CONNECTIVITY; THIRD PARTY DIGITAL CAMERAS AND PRINTERS; AND A NUMBER OF

PORTABLE COMPUTER RELATED ACCESSORIES.



NET

SALES OF OTHER MUSIC PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SALES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ITUNES MUSIC STORE AND IPOD RELATED SERVICES AND ACCESSORIES, INCREASED $32 MILLION OR 800%

DURING 2003 COMPARED TO 2002. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE ITUNES MUSIC STORE FOR THE MACINTOSH

31

OPERATING

SYSTEM IN APRIL 2003 AND HIGHER SALES OF IPOD SERVICES AND ACCESSORIES CONSISTENT WITH THE INCREASE IN IPOD NET SALES AND UNIT SALES DURING 2003.



ALTHOUGH

TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES WERE DOWN 3% IN 2003, UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE SYSTEMS WERE RELATIVELY STRONG PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 69% OR 247,000 UNIT

INCREASE IN POWERBOOK UNIT SALES, SLIGHTLY OFFSET BY A 4% OR 30,000 UNIT DECREASE IN IBOOK UNIT SALES. THE INCREASE IN POWERBOOK NET SALES OF $468 MILLION OR 56% WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE

SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY'S NEW 12-INCH, 15-INCH AND 17-INCH MODELS THAT WERE INTRODUCED DURING 2003. THE DECLINE IN IBOOK CONSUMER PORTABLE SALES DURING 2003 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER AVERAGE PRICE PER UNIT. PORTABLE SYSTEMS REPRESENTED 42% OF ALL MACINTOSH SYSTEMS SOLD IN 2003 VERSUS 33% IN 2002, WHICH REFLECTED AN OVERALL INDUSTRY TREND TOWARDS PORTABLE

SYSTEMS.



THE

COMPANY'S AVERAGE NET SALES PER MACINTOSH UNIT SOLD INCREASED 2% TO $1,491 IN 2003 AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS CHANGES IN OVERALL UNIT MIX TOWARDS RELATIVELY HIGHER-PRICED

POWERBOOK SYSTEMS AND INCREASES DIRECT SALES PRIMARILY FROM THE COMPANY'S RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES, OFFSET BY SOMEWHAT LOWER YEAR-OVER-YEAR PRICING ON COMPARABLE MACINTOSH

SYSTEMS FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY'S MACINTOSH PRODUCT LINES IN RESPONSE TO INDUSTRY PRICING PRESSURE, PARTICULARLY WITH THE COMPANY'S IBOOK CONSUMER PORTABLE SYSTEMS. POWERBOOK AND POWER MACINTOSH

SYSTEMS ACCOUNTED FOR 42% OF TOTAL UNIT SALES IN 2003 VERSUS 36% IN 2002.



NET

SALES OF SOFTWARE INCREASED $55 MILLION OR 18% DURING 2003 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR AND REFLECTED HIGHER NET SALES OF APPLE-BRANDED APPLICATION AND SERVER

SOFTWARE AND THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE. NET SALES OF APPLE-BRANDED APPLICATION AND SERVER SOFTWARE INCREASED DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF SEVERAL NEW SOFTWARE TITLES DURING FISCAL 2003 INCLUDING FINAL CUT

EXPRESS, ILIFE, AND KEYNOTE, AS WELL AS FROM HIGHER SALES OF SOFTWARE RELATED TO RECENT ACQUISITIONS INCLUDING POWERSCHOOL AND EMAGIC. GROWTH IN NET SALES OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DURING 2003 WAS

PARTICULARLY STRONG IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT DUE TO STRONG SALES OF SOFTWARE BY THE COMPANY'S ONLINE STORE AND ITS RETAIL SEGMENT.



SERVICE

AND OTHER SALES ROSE $55 MILLION OR 24% DURING 2003 WHICH PRIMARILY RESULTED FROM SIGNIFICANT YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN NET SALES

ASSOCIATED WITH APP EXTENDED MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S INTERNET RELATED SERVICES. INCREASED NET SALES ASSOCIATED WITH APP WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INCREASING

ATTACH RATES OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. INCREASED NET SALES ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNET SERVICES WERE DUE TO INCREASED NET SALES OF THE COMPANY'S .MAC INTERNET SERVICE.

OFFSETTING

THE FAVORABLE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY'S NET SALES DURING 2003 WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE FOLLOWING FACTORS.



TOTAL

UNIT SALES OF DESKTOP SYSTEMS FELL 15% DURING 2003 COMPARED TO 2002. IMAC SYSTEMS UNIT SALES DECLINED 16% FROM 2003 TO 2002 RESULTING FROM A SHIFT IN SALES AWAY FROM

DESKTOP SYSTEMS IN FAVOR OF PORTABLES. ALSO, THE FLAT PANEL IMAC FORM FACTOR AVAILABLE DURING FISCAL 2003 WAS IN THE EIGHTH QUARTER OF ITS LIFE CYCLE BY THE END OF 2003.



UNIT

SALES OF POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS FELL 13% DURING 2003 COMPARED TO 2002. FOR THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2003 COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002, UNIT SALES OF POWER

MACINTOSH SYSTEMS DECREASED 24%, WHICH WAS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE DECLINE OF POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS SALES EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY DURING RECENT YEARS AND WAS ALSO BELIEVED TO BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO

DELAYS IN PURCHASING PENDING THE RELEASE OF THE POWER MAC G5. AS EXPECTED, THIS TREND REVERSED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003 WITH UNIT SALES INCREASING 26% DURING THE QUARTER AS COMPARED TO THE

SAME PERIOD IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE LARGELY TO THE NEW POWER MAC G5, WHICH THE COMPANY INTRODUCED IN JUNE 2003 AND BEGAN SHIPPING AT THE END OF FISCAL 2003. THE DECLINE IN POWER MACINTOSH

SALES OVER THE PREVIOUS SEVERAL YEARS ALSO REFLECTS THE SHIFT IN SALES TO PORTABLE SYSTEMS, PARTICULARLY POWERBOOKS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OVER THE PAST

32

SEVERAL

YEARS HAD A PRONOUNCED NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ITS PROFESSIONAL AND CREATIVE CUSTOMERS. ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF THE COMPANY'S PROFESSIONAL AND CREATIVE CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE DELAYED UPGRADES OF THEIR

SYSTEMS IN ANTICIPATION OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE VENDORS TRANSITIONING THEIR PROFESSIONALLY ORIENTED MACINTOSH SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS TO RUN NATIVELY ON MAC OS X.



THE

COMPANY EXPERIENCED ONGOING WEAKNESS IN ITS U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL DURING 2003. NET SALES AND UNIT SALES IN U.S. EDUCATION DURING 2003 WERE DOWN 4% AND 6%, RESPECTIVELY,

AS COMPARED TO 2002. THIS DECLINE WAS DUE TO A DECREASE IN K-12 SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN HIGHER EDUCATION SALES. NET SALES DECLINED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A CONTINUED

SHIFT IN MIX AWAY FROM HIGHER PRICED POWER MACINTOSH AND IMAC SYSTEMS TOWARDS LOWER PRICED EMAC AND IBOOK SYSTEMS, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DID EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN SALES OF ITS POWERBOOK

SYSTEMS PRIMARILY TO HIGHER EDUCATION CUSTOMERS. PORTABLE SYSTEMS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 43% OF TOTAL UNIT SALES IN THE EDUCATION CHANNEL DURING 2003, AS COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY 34% IN 2002.

SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE

THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE COMPRISED OF THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND RETAIL. THE

AMERICAS SEGMENT INCLUDES BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA, EXCEPT FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT. THE EUROPE SEGMENT INCLUDES EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA.

THE JAPAN SEGMENT INCLUDES ONLY JAPAN AND EXCLUDES REVENUE FROM THE COMPANY'S OWN RETAIL STORES IN JAPAN, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT. THE RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATED APPLE-OWNED

RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. AND JAPAN DURING FISCAL 2004. EACH REPORTABLE GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT PROVIDES SIMILAR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SIMILAR SERVICES. FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING

THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS MAY BE FOUND IN ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT NOTE 11, "SEGMENT INFORMATION AND

GEOGRAPHIC DATA."

AMERICAS

DURING FISCAL 2004, NET SALES IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT GREW 26% OR $838 MILLION COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES DURING 2004 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE

TO THE SIGNIFICANT YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN IPOD SALES AS WELL AS STRONG SALES OF PERIPHERALS, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SHIFT IN SALES

TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT, WHICH HAD 84 STORES IN THE U.S. AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2004. MACINTOSH UNIT SALES ALSO INCREASED BY 4% IN FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY STRONG SALES OF

PORTABLE AND POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN IMAC SALES. DURING 2004 AND 2003, THE AMERICAS SEGMENT REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 49% AND 51%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE

COMPANY'S TOTAL NET SALES AND REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 51% AND 54%, RESPECTIVELY, OF TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES. AS NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL NET

SALES OF 19% FOR FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. STRONG U.S. EDUCATION NET SALES FOR THE CURRENT YEAR RELATE PRIMARILY TO STRENGTH IN HIGHER EDUCATION NET SALES THAT RESULTED FROM A SUCCESSFUL

BACK-TO-SCHOOL SELLING SEASON WITH STRONG DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PORTABLES. THIS STRENGTH DROVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN NET SALES OF 40% FOR THE

HIGHER EDUCATION CHANNEL DURING FISCAL 2004. THE COMPANY'S K-12 NET SALES GREW YEAR-OVER-YEAR BY 3% DURING FISCAL 2004, DESPITE THE CHALLENGES IN THE

K-12 MARKET FROM CONTINUED BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND INCREASED COMPETITION, DUE TO THE COMPANY'S CONTINUED FOCUS AND SUCCESS WITH DELIVERING 1:1 EDUCATION SOLUTIONS.

NET

SALES IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT DURING 2003 INCREASED $50 MILLION OR 2% COMPARED TO 2002. DURING 2003 AND 2002, THE AMERICAS SEGMENT REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 51% AND 55%, RESPECTIVELY, OF

THE COMPANY'S TOTAL NET SALES AND REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 54% AND 56%, RESPECTIVELY, OF TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES. THE RESULTS OF THE AMERICAS SEGMENT ARE SIMILAR TO THE OVERALL RESULTS OF THE

COMPANY AS THEY REFLECT SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER UNIT SALES AND NET SALES OF POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS AND IMAC SYSTEMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN UNIT SALES AND NET SALES OF POWERBOOKS. THE NET SALES

OF THE AMERICAS SEGMENT, AND THE COMPANY IN TOTAL, ALSO REFLECT SUBSTANTIALLY HIGHER SALES OF IPODS, PERIPHERALS, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES DURING 2003 COMPARED TO 2002. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT HAD BEEN

NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY WEAKNESS IN ITS U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL DURING 2003. TOTAL NET SALES AND UNIT SALES IN THE U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL DURING 2003

33

WERE

DOWN 4% AND 6%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS DECLINE WAS CAUSED BY INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE EDUCATION MARKET AND BY A REDUCTION IN SPENDING BY

U.S. EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS DUE TO FEDERAL AND STATE FUNDING CONCERNS AND TAX REVENUE SHORTFALLS RESULTING FROM THE WEAK ECONOMY. ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF THE DECLINE DURING 2003 IN NET SALES AND UNIT

SALES OF MACINTOSH SYSTEMS IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT MAY BE THE RESULT OF THE OPERATION OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT WHOSE NET SALES, ALL OF WHICH OCCURRED WITHIN THE U.S., INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY

DURING 2003.

EUROPE

NET SALES IN EUROPE REBOUNDED IN FISCAL 2004 INCREASING $490 MILLION OR 37% FROM 2003. TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES IN EUROPE ALSO EXPERIENCED GROWTH DURING THE CURRENT

YEAR BY INCREASING 13% IN FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. CONSISTENT WITH THE AMERICAS SEGMENT, EUROPE EXPERIENCED STRONG NET SALES ACROSS ALL PRODUCT LINES, EXCEPT FOR THE IMAC SYSTEMS. DEMAND IN

EUROPE DURING FISCAL 2004 WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG FOR THE COMPANY'S POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS AND PORTABLE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS, WHICH EXPERIENCED YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES OF 29%

AND 42%, RESPECTIVELY. SIMILAR TO THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S OTHER SEGMENTS, NET SALES OF IPODS, PERIPHERALS AND SOFTWARE WERE STRONG IN FISCAL 2004.

NET

SALES IN EUROPE INCREASED $58 MILLION OR 5% DURING 2003 AS COMPARED TO 2002 WHILE MACINTOSH UNIT SALES DECLINED BY 5% DURING THE SAME PERIOD. EUROPE'S OPERATING RESULTS WERE CONSISTENT WITH

THE TREND EXPERIENCED IN THE AMERICAS AND BY THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE. EUROPE EXPERIENCED WEAKENED DEMAND FOR POWER MACINTOSH, IMAC AND IBOOK SYSTEMS IN 2003, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STRONG DEMAND FOR

POWERBOOKS WHOSE NET SALES INCREASED BY 48% OR $100 MILLION FROM 2002. EUROPE ALSO REALIZED INCREASED SALES OF IPODS, PERIPHERALS, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES.

JAPAN

THE JAPAN SEGMENT CONTINUES TO BE A CHALLENGE FOR THE COMPANY, WITH FOUR CONSECUTIVE YEARS OF YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINES IN BOTH NET SALES AND MACINTOSH

UNIT SALES. JAPAN'S NET SALES AND UNIT SALES WERE DOWN 3% AND 14%, RESPECTIVELY DURING FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003, CONTINUING TO LAG BEHIND ALL OF THE COMPANY'S OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS. THESE

DECREASES IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES ARE BELIEVED TO BE ATTRIBUTABLE IN PART TO A SHIFT IN SALES FROM THE JAPAN SEGMENT TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT AS A RESULT OF THE OPENING OF TWO STORES IN JAPAN IN

FISCAL 2004. IN ADDITION, SUCH DECREASES MAY HAVE BEEN RELATED TO DELAYED COMPUTER SYSTEM UPGRADES BY SOME PROFESSIONAL AND CREATIVE CUSTOMERS WHO WERE AWAITING THE RELEASE OF QUARK XPRESS 6

FOR MAC OS X, WHICH DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL SEPTEMBER 2004. THE DECREASE IN NET SALES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STRONG IPOD AND IBOOK SALES DURING FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO 2003.

NET

SALES IN JAPAN DECREASED $12 MILLION OR 2% DURING 2003 AS COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 2002, THE WEAKEST YEAR-TO-DATE PERFORMANCE OF ANY OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING

SEGMENTS. JAPAN'S MACINTOSH UNIT SALES WERE PARTICULARLY WEAK IN 2003, DECLINING 12%, AND WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER SALES OF IMAC AND IBOOK SYSTEMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN

POWERBOOK SALES AS WELL AS HIGHER SALES OF IPODS, AND PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE. JAPAN'S MACINTOSH UNIT SALES REMAINED SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE SEGMENT'S HISTORIC LEVELS DUE TO ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

THAT REMAINED PARTICULARLY NEGATIVE IN JAPAN.

RETAIL

THE COMPANY OPENED 21 NEW RETAIL STORES DURING 2004, INCLUDING ITS FIRST TWO INTERNATIONAL STORES IN TOKYO AND OSAKA, JAPAN, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OPEN STORES TO 86 AS

OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004. THIS COMPARES TO 65 OPEN STORES AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003 AND 40 OPEN STORES AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES OPENING APPROXIMATELY 14 ADDITIONAL STORES TO END THE CALENDAR YEAR AT APPROXIMATELY 100 STORES. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE STORES EXPECTED TO OPEN DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005

WILL BE IN THE NEW "MINI" STORE DESIGN, WHICH IS THE COMPANY'S SMALLEST STORE FORMAT TO DATE; ALLOWING IT TO BE PLACED IN A VARIETY OF NEW LOCATIONS TO INTRODUCE THE COMPANY'S INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS TO

EVEN MORE CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY ALSO OPENED ITS THIRD INTERNATIONAL STORE IN LONDON, ENGLAND DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005.

34

NET

SALES OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT GREW TO $1.185 BILLION DURING 2004 FROM $621 MILLION AND $283 MILLION, IN 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASES IN NET SALES DURING BOTH 2004

AND 2003 REFLECT THE IMPACT OF NEW STORE OPENINGS FOR EACH FISCAL YEAR, INCLUDING THE OPENING OF 21 NEW STORES IN 2004 AND 25 NEW STORES IN 2003. AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE ALSO

CONTRIBUTED TO THE SEGMENT'S STRONG SALES IN FISCAL 2004. WITH AN AVERAGE OF 76 STORES OPEN DURING 2004, THE RETAIL SEGMENT ACHIEVED ANNUALIZED REVENUE PER STORE OF APPROXIMATELY $15.6 MILLION,

AS COMPARED TO $11.5 MILLION IN 2003 WITH A 54 STORE AVERAGE AND $10.2 MILLION IN 2002 WITH A 28 STORE AVERAGE.

AS

MEASURED BY THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENT REPORTING, THE RETAIL SEGMENT REPORTED PROFIT OF $39 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2004 AS COMPARED TO LOSSES OF $5 MILLION AND $22 MILLION

DURING 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THIS IMPROVEMENT IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SEGMENT'S YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN AVERAGE QUARTERLY REVENUE PER STORE, THE IMPACT OF

OPENING NEW STORES, AND THE SEGMENT'S YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN NET SALES, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER LEVERAGE ON OCCUPANCY, DEPRECIATION AND OTHER FIXED COSTS.

EXPANSION

OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN FIXED ASSETS AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE, OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS, PERSONNEL, AND OTHER

OPERATING EXPENSES. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETAIL SEGMENT WERE $104 MILLION IN FISCAL 2004, BRINGING THE TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES SINCE INCEPTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT TO

APPROXIMATELY $394 MILLION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAD APPROXIMATELY 2,100 EMPLOYEES AND HAD OUTSTANDING OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL STORE

SPACE AND RELATED FACILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $436 MILLION. THE COMPANY WOULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS SHOULD IT CHOOSE TO TERMINATE ITS RETAIL SEGMENT OR CLOSE INDIVIDUAL STORES. SUCH COSTS

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

GROSS MARGIN

GROSS

MARGIN DECLINED IN FISCAL 2004 TO 27.3% OF NET SALES FROM 27.5% OF NET SALES IN 2003. THE COMPANY'S GROSS MARGIN DURING FISCAL 2004 DECLINED DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MIX TOWARDS LOWER MARGIN IPOD

AND IBOOK SALES, PRICING ACTIONS ON CERTAIN POWER MACINTOSH G5 MODELS THAT WERE TRANSITIONED DURING THE BEGINNING OF 2004, HIGHER WARRANTY COSTS ON CERTAIN PORTABLE MACINTOSH PRODUCTS, AND HIGHER

FREIGHT AND DUTY COSTS DURING FISCAL 2004. THESE UNFAVORABLE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN DIRECT SALES AND A 39% YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN HIGHER MARGIN

SOFTWARE SALES.

THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ITS GROSS MARGIN AND THE GROSS MARGIN OF THE OVERALL PERSONAL COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES WILL REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE THROUGHOUT FISCAL 2005 IN LIGHT OF

PRICE COMPETITION, ESPECIALLY FOR THE IPOD PRODUCT LINE. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS TO CONTINUE TO INCUR AIR

FREIGHT CHARGES, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACT GROSS MARGINS ON THE IMAC AND OTHER PRODUCTS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005 AND POSSIBLY BEYOND.

THE

FOREGOING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANY'S EXPECTED GROSS MARGIN DURING 2005, GENERAL DEMAND FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS, ANTICIPATED AIR FREIGHT CHARGES, AND FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE FORWARD-

LOOKING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CURRENT GROSS MARGINS WILL BE MAINTAINED OR TARGETED GROSS MARGIN LEVELS WILL BE ACHIEVED. IN GENERAL, GROSS MARGINS AND MARGINS ON INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING IPODS, WILL REMAIN UNDER SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD PRESSURE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED INDUSTRY WIDE

35

GLOBAL

PRICING PRESSURES, INCREASED COMPETITION, COMPRESSED PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIAL AND OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES, AND POTENTIAL

CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT MIX, INCLUDING HIGHER UNIT SALES OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS WITH LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND LOWER GROSS MARGINS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE DOWNWARD PRESSURES, THE COMPANY

EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PRICING ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITS PRODUCTS. GROSS MARGINS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE PRODUCT QUALITY AND WARRANTY COSTS

AND TO STIMULATE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING STRATEGY AND PRICING TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANTICIPATED CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OVER TIME; HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED IN THE SHORT-TERM BY FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES.

THE

COMPANY ORDERS COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILDS INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S MARKETS ARE VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, THERE

IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND PRODUCE OR ORDER FROM THIRD-PARTIES EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY LEVELS AND OUTSTANDING PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND TO

RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

GROSS

MARGIN DECREASED TO 27.5% OF NET SALES IN 2003 FROM 27.9% OF NET SALES IN 2002. THIS DECLINE IN GROSS MARGIN REFLECTS RELATIVELY AGGRESSIVE PRICING ACTIONS ON SEVERAL MACINTOSH MODELS INSTITUTED

BY THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN LATE FISCAL 2002 AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED PRICING PRESSURE THROUGHOUT THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY, LOWER SALES OF RELATIVELY HIGHER MARGIN POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS DURING

THE FIRST THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2003, AND INCREASED AIR FREIGHT AND MANUFACTURING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCTION RAMP-UP OF THE NEW POWER MAC G5 AND 15-INCH POWERBOOK,

BOTH OF WHICH BEGAN SHIPPING IN VOLUME DURING SEPTEMBER 2003. THIS DECLINE IS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO A RISE IN CERTAIN COMPONENT COSTS AS THE YEAR PROGRESSED. THE AFOREMENTIONED NEGATIVE FACTORS

AFFECTING GROSS MARGINS DURING 2003 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN HIGHER MARGIN SOFTWARE AND DIRECT SALES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D)

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THAT FOCUSED INVESTMENTS IN R&D ARE CRITICAL TO ITS FUTURE GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO TIMELY

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE COMPANY'S CORE BUSINESS STRATEGY. THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY RELIED UPON INNOVATION TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. R&D EXPENSE AMOUNTED TO

APPROXIMATELY 6% OF TOTAL NET SALES DURING FISCAL 2004 DOWN FROM 8% OF TOTAL NET SALES IN BOTH 2003 AND 2002. THIS DECREASE IS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF 33% IN TOTAL NET SALES OF THE COMPANY

FOR FISCAL 2004. ALTHOUGH R&D EXPENSE DECREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES IN FISCAL 2004, ACTUAL EXPENDITURES FOR R&D IN FISCAL 2004 INCREASED $18 MILLION OR 4% FROM FISCAL 2003, WHICH

FOLLOWS A 6% OR $25 MILLION INCREASE IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002. THE OVERALL INCREASE IN R&D EXPENSE RELATES PRIMARILY TO INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND SUPPORT FOR NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

AND THE IMPACT OF EMPLOYEE SALARY MERIT INCREASES IN 2004. R&D SPENDING ALSO INCLUDED CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $4.5 MILLION RELATED TO THE

36

DEVELOPMENT

OF MAC OS X TIGER AND $2.3 MILLION RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FILEMAKER PRO 7 IN 2004; $14.7 MILLION RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF

MAC OS X PANTHER IN 2003; AND APPROXIMATELY $13.3 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X JAGUAR AND APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE

POWERSCHOOL ENTERPRISE STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM IN 2002. FURTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF

THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (SG&A)

EXPENDITURES FOR SG&A INCREASED $209 MILLION OR 17% DURING 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. THESE INCREASES ARE DUE PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANY'S CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL

SEGMENT IN BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, A CURRENT YEAR INCREASE IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING ON MARKETING AND ADVERTISING, AN INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRICTED STOCK

COMPENSATION, AND HIGHER DIRECT AND CHANNEL SELLING EXPENSES RESULTING FROM THE INCREASE IN NET SALES AND EMPLOYEE SALARY MERIT INCREASES. SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES IN 2004 WAS 17%, DOWN

FROM 20% IN 2003. THIS DECREASE IS DUE TO THE INCREASE OF 33% IN TOTAL NET SALES OF THE COMPANY FOR FISCAL 2004, REFLECTING LEVERAGE ON THE COMPANY'S FIXED COSTS.

SG&A

INCREASED $103 MILLION OR 9% DURING 2003 AS COMPARED TO 2002 DUE PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANY'S CONTINUED EXPANSION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT AND INCREASES IN HEADCOUNT. THE OVERALL INCREASE WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN 2003 DISCRETIONARY SPENDING ON MARKETING AND ADVERTISING AND BY SAVINGS RESULTING FROM THE 2003 AND 2002 RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES DESCRIBED BELOW.

FISCAL 2004 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDED TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $23 MILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $14 MILLION

IN SEVERANCE COSTS, $5.5 MILLION IN ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, AND A $3.5 MILLION CHARGE FOR LEASE CANCELLATIONS. OF THE $23 MILLION CHARGE, $14.3 MILLION HAD BEEN SPENT BY THE END

OF 2004, WITH THE REMAINING $8.7 MILLION CONSISTING OF $5.2 MILLION FOR EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE BENEFITS AND $3.5 MILLION FOR LEASE CANCELLATIONS.

TO THE END OF 2004.

THE

CLOSING OF MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS IN SACRAMENTO RESULTED IN THE ELIMINATION OF 67 POSITIONS FOR A SEVERANCE COST OF $1.9 MILLION AND WRITE-OFF OF $5.3 MILLION IN

MANUFACTURING-RELATED FIXED ASSETS WHOSE USE CEASED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004. TERMINATION OF SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, PRINCIPALLY IN THE U.S., RESULTED IN SEVERANCE OF

THE COMPANY RECORDED TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $26.8 MILLION DURING THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY

$7.4 MILLION IN SEVERANCE COSTS, A $5.0 MILLION CHARGE TO WRITE-OFF DEFERRED COMPENSATION, $7.1 MILLION IN ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND A $7.3 MILLION CHARGE FOR LEASE

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, APPROXIMATELY $500,000 OF THE AMOUNT ORIGINALLY ACCRUED FOR LEASE CANCELLATIONS WAS DETERMINED TO BE IN EXCESS DUE TO THE SUBLEASE OF A PROPERTY SOONER THAN ORIGINALLY

ESTIMATED AND AN APPROXIMATELY $500,000 SHORTFALL WAS IDENTIFIED IN THE SEVERANCE ACCRUAL DUE TO HIGHER THAN EXPECTED SEVERANCE COSTS RELATED TO THE CLOSURE OF THE COMPANY'S SINGAPORE MANUFACTURING

OPERATIONS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS HAD NO NET EFFECT ON REPORTED OPERATING EXPENSE.

DURING

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT APPROVED AND INITIATED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS THAT RESULTED IN RECOGNITION OF A TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $2.8 MILLION, INCLUDING

$2.4 MILLION IN SEVERANCE COSTS AND $400,000 FOR ASSET WRITE-OFFS AND LEASE PAYMENTS ON AN ABANDONED FACILITY. ACTIONS TAKEN IN THE SECOND QUARTER WERE FOR THE MOST PART

MARKETING ACTIVITIES AND EMPLOYEES, PRINCIPALLY IN THE U.S. AND EUROPE, RESULTED IN SEVERANCE COSTS OF $2.8 MILLION AND ACCRUAL OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH OPERATING LEASES ON CLOSED FACILITIES OF

$6.7 MILLION. THE

TOTAL NET RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $23 MILLION RECOGNIZED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003 ALSO REFLECTS THE REVERSAL OF $600,000 OF UNUSED RESTRUCTURING ACCRUAL ORIGINALLY MADE DURING THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2002.

FISCAL 2002 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

DURING FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION RELATED TO ACTIONS INTENDED TO ELIMINATE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES AND BETTER

ALIGN THE COMPANY'S OPERATING EXPENSES WITH

38

EXISTING

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE COST OF CONTINUING INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN THE COMPANY'S RETAIL OPERATING SEGMENT.

DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT APPROVED AND INITIATED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS WITH A TOTAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION DESIGNED TO REDUCE HEADCOUNT COSTS IN

CORPORATE OPERATIONS AND SALES AND TO ADJUST ITS POWERSCHOOL PRODUCT STRATEGY. THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS RESULTED IN THE ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 180 POSITIONS WORLDWIDE AT A COST OF

$1.8 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH WERE ELIMINATED BY SEPTEMBER 27, 2003. ELIMINATED POSITIONS WERE PRIMARILY IN CORPORATE OPERATIONS, SALES, AND POWERSCHOOL RELATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN

THE AMERICAS OPERATING SEGMENT. THE SHIFT IN PRODUCT STRATEGY AT POWERSCHOOL INCLUDED DISCONTINUING DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OF POWERSCHOOL'S PSE PRODUCT. THIS SHIFT RESULTED IN THE IMPAIRMENT OF

PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PSE PRODUCT IN THE AMOUNT OF $4.5 MILLION.

DURING

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT APPROVED AND INITIATED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS WITH A TOTAL COST OF APPROXIMATELY $24 MILLION. THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS RESULTED IN

FUNCTIONS. IN ADDITION, THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ALSO INCLUDED SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S INFORMATION SYSTEMS STRATEGY RESULTING IN TERMINATION OF EQUIPMENT LEASES AND CANCELLATION OF

EXISTING PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY CEASED USING THE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH FIRST QUARTER 2002 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS DURING THAT SAME QUARTER. RELATED LEASE AND CONTRACT CANCELLATION CHARGES

TOTALED $12 MILLION, AND CHARGES FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENTS TOTALED $4 MILLION. THE FIRST QUARTER 2002 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO CORPORATE ACTIVITY NOT ALLOCATED TO

OPERATING SEGMENTS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY REVERSED THE REMAINING UNUSED ACCRUAL OF $600,000.

PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D)

$551,000 OF WHICH WAS

ALLOCATED TO IPR&D. THE AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATED TO IPR&D WAS EXPENSED UPON ACQUISITION, BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND

NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES EXISTED. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D WAS DETERMINED USING THE INCOME APPROACH, WHICH REFLECTS THE PROJECTED FREE CASH FLOWS THAT WILL BE GENERATED BY THE IPR&D PROJECTS AND

THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY, AND DISCOUNTING THE PROJECTED NET CASH FLOWS BACK TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE USING A DISCOUNT RATE OF 25%.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON NON-CURRENT INVESTMENTS

OVER THE COURSE OF THE LAST THREE YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS HELD INVESTMENTS THAT WERE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE IN EARTHLINK INC.

(EARTHLINK), AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (AKAMAI), ARM HOLDINGS PLC (ARM) AND CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE COMPANIES. FURTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S NON-CURRENT DEBT

AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DURING

2004, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS REMAINING 986,000 SHARES OF AKAMAI STOCK. THE TRANSACTION GENERATED PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF APPROXIMATELY

$4 MILLION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY NON-CURRENT PUBLIC COMPANY INVESTMENTS REFLECTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

DURING

2003, THE COMPANY SOLD 1,875,000 SHARES OF AKAMAI STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION, AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, THE

COMPANY SOLD ITS REMAINING INVESTMENT IN ARM STOCK, 278,000 SHARES, FOR NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $295,000, AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $270,000, AND SOLD ITS REMAINING INVESTMENT IN EARTHLINK

STOCK, 6,540,000 SHARES, FOR NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $37 MILLION, AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $2 MILLION.

DURING

2002, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS WERE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A $44 MILLION

CHARGE TO EARNINGS TO WRITEDOWN THE BASIS OF ITS INVESTMENT IN EARTHLINK, A $6 MILLION CHARGE TO EARNINGS TO WRITEDOWN THE BASIS OF ITS INVESTMENT IN AKAMAI, AND A $15 MILLION CHARGE TO

EARNINGS TO WRITEDOWN THE BASIS OF ITS INVESTMENT IN A PRIVATE COMPANY INVESTMENT. THESE LOSSES IN 2002 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SALE OF 117,000 SHARES OF EARTHLINK STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF

$2 MILLION AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $223,000, THE SALE OF 250,000 SHARES OF AKAMAI STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $2 MILLION AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $710,000, AND THE SALE OF

APPROXIMATELY 4.7 MILLION SHARES OF ARM STOCK FOR BOTH NET PROCEEDS AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $21 MILLION.

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET

TOTAL INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET DECREASED $30 MILLION OR 36% TO $53 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2004 COMPARED TO $83 MILLION IN 2003 AND $112 MILLION

IN 2002. THESE DECREASES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO DECLINING INVESTMENT YIELDS ON THE COMPANY'S CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS RESULTING FROM LOWER MARKET INTEREST AND A SHORTENING OF

THE AVERAGE MATURITY OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, AS WELL AS LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN FISCAL 2004. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED BY THE

COMPANY ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS FELL TO 1.38% IN 2004 COMPARED TO THE 1.89% AND 2.85% RATES EARNED DURING 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY

OCCASIONALLY SELLS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO THEIR STATED MATURITIES. AS A RESULT OF SUCH SALES, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET GAINS OF $1 MILLION, $21 MILLION AND

$7 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN TOTAL INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET DURING FISCAL 2003 WAS ALSO OFFSET BY THE $6 MILLION GAIN RELATED TO THE

FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003 WHICH IS FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW UNDER THE HEADING "CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES."

INTEREST

EXPENSE CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF INTEREST ON THE COMPANY'S $300 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT UNSECURED NOTES, WHICH WERE REPAID UPON THEIR MATURITY IN FEBRUARY 2004,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AMORTIZATION OF DEFERRED GAINS REALIZED IN 2002 AND 2001 THAT RESULTED FROM THE CLOSURE OF SWAP POSITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UNSECURED NOTES. THE UNSECURED NOTES WERE SOLD AT

99.925% OF PAR FOR AN EFFECTIVE YIELD TO MATURITY OF 6.51%. TOTAL DEFERRED GAIN RESULTING FROM THE CLOSURE OF DEBT SWAPS OF APPROXIMATELY $23 MILLION WAS FULLY AMORTIZED AS OF THE NOTES'

MATURITY IN FEBRUARY 2004.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 25, 2004 WAS APPROXIMATELY 28%. THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE RATE DIFFERS FROM THE STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX

RATE OF 35% DUE PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO

40

BE

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARISING FROM DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TAX LOSSES, AND TAX CREDITS OF

$647 MILLION BEFORE BEING OFFSET AGAINST CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR PRESENTATION ON THE COMPANY'S BALANCE SHEET. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN

NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $30 MILLION WAS RECORDED AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR THE BENEFITS OF TAX LOSSES THAT MAY NOT BE REALIZED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE

RELATES PRINCIPALLY TO THE OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS ACQUIRED FROM NEXT AND OTHER ACQUISITIONS, THE UTILIZATION OF WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE REALIZABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS QUARTERLY BY ASSESSING THE NEED FOR AND AMOUNT OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

THE

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) HAS COMPLETED ITS FIELD AUDIT OF THE COMPANY'S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR ALL YEARS PRIOR TO 2001 AND PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. CERTAIN OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS

ARE BEING CONTESTED THROUGH THE IRS APPEALS OFFICE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL IRS AUDIT ISSUES FOR THESE YEARS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL, AND

FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED

WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANY'S TAX AUDITS BE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR

INCOME TAX IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.

CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY

ON MAY 15, 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED SFAS NO. 150,

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH

CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY

. SFAS NO. 150 REQUIRES ISSUERS TO CLASSIFY AS LIABILITIES CERTAIN FREESTANDING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT EMBODY

OBLIGATIONS FOR THE ISSUER AND HAVE CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 150 ON JUNE 29, 2003, WHICH RESULTED IN A FAVORABLE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT TYPE ADJUSTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION. THIS ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTED THE MARK-TO-MARKET ADJUSTMENT TO FAIR VALUE FOR A FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT

THAT ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE 1.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT A PRICE OF $16.64 PER SHARE. THE COMPANY SETTLED THIS FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT IN AUGUST 2003. THE

SETTLEMENT RESULTED IN AN ADDITIONAL GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET.

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

, WHICH

ADDRESSES FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT COSTS. NET OF THE RELATED

INCOME TAX EFFECT OF APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION, ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 143 RESULTED IN AN UNFAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT TYPE ADJUSTMENT TO NET INCOME DURING 2003 OF APPROXIMATELY

$2 MILLION. THIS ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTS CUMULATIVE DEPRECIATION AND ACCRETION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED THROUGH THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 143 HAD THE STATEMENT BEEN APPLIED

TO THE COMPANY'S EXISTING ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT THE TIME THEY WERE INITIALLY INCURRED.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RELEASED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 104,

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

, WHICH SUPERCEDES SAB 101,

REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

. SAB 104 CLARIFIES EXISTING

GUIDANCE REGARDING REVENUE CONTRACTS THAT CONTAIN MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES TO MAKE IT CONSISTENT WITH EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) NO. 00-21. THE ADOPTION OF SAB 104 DID

NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

41

IN

DECEMBER 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. (FIN) 46R, A REVISION TO FIN 46,

CONSOLIDATION OF

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

FIN 46R CLARIFIES SOME OF THE PROVISIONS OF FIN 46 AND EXEMPTS CERTAIN ENTITIES FROM ITS REQUIREMENTS. FIN 46R IS EFFECTIVE AT THE END

OF THE FIRST INTERIM PERIOD ENDING AFTER MARCH 15, 2004. THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46R DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN

MARCH 2004, THE FASB ISSUED EITF ISSUE NO. 03-1,

THE MEANING OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT AND ITS APPLICATION TO

CERTAIN INVESTMENTS

. EITF 03-1 INCLUDES NEW GUIDANCE FOR EVALUATING AND RECORDING IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS NEW DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS FOR INVESTMENTS THAT ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION EITF 03-1-1, WHICH DELAYS THE

EFFECTIVE DATE UNTIL ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE IS ISSUED FOR THE APPLICATION OF THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PROVISIONS OF EITF 03-1 TO INVESTMENTS IN SECURITIES THAT ARE IMPAIRED;

HOWEVER, THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER JUNE 15, 2004. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF EITF 03-1,

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY MEASURES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD PRESCRIBED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD

(APB) OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

AND PROVIDES PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES OF THE EFFECT ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER

SHARE AS IF THE FAIR VALUE-BASED METHOD HAD BEEN APPLIED IN MEASURING COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO FOLLOW APB OPINION NO. 25 BECAUSE, AS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE ALTERNATIVE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING PROVIDED FOR UNDER SFAS NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION

, REQUIRES USE OF OPTION VALUATION MODELS THAT WERE NOT DEVELOPED FOR USE IN VALUING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN SHARES. UNDER APB OPINION

NO. 25, WHEN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS EQUALS THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED.

ON

MARCH 31, 2004, THE FASB ISSUED A PROPOSED STATEMENT,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT,

THAT ADDRESSES THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS

IN WHICH AN ENTERPRISE RECEIVES EMPLOYEE SERVICES IN EXCHANGE FOR (A) EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF THE ENTERPRISE OR (B) LIABILITIES THAT ARE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ENTERPRISE'S EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS OR THAT MAY BE SETTLED BY THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. THE PROPOSED STATEMENT WOULD ELIMINATE THE ABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS USING APB OPINION

NO. 25 AND GENERALLY WOULD REQUIRE INSTEAD THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING A FAIR-VALUE-BASED METHOD. IF ADOPTED, IT IS CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED THAT THE PROPOSED

STATEMENT WOULD BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN ITS FOURTH FISCAL QUARTER OF 2005.

AT

THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL SHAREHOLDERS MEETING ON APRIL 24, 2003, SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED A PROPOSAL REQUESTING THAT THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS (THE BOARD) ESTABLISH A POLICY OF EXPENSING THE

VALUE OF ALL FUTURE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED BY THE COMPANY. THE BOARD AND MANAGEMENT APPRECIATE AND TAKE SERIOUSLY THE VIEWS EXPRESSED BY THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS. THE COMPANY DECIDED NOT TO

EXPENSE THE VALUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS UNTIL THE FASB FINALIZES ITS NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON THE MATTER, WHICH MAY PLAY A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF AND ACCOUNTING FOR

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. THE COMPANY MONITORS PROGRESS AT THE FASB AND OTHER DEVELOPMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE GENERAL ISSUE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK COMPENSATION. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING THE

POTENTIAL IMPACT FROM THE GUIDANCE OF THE PROPOSED STATEMENT, WHICH MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO RECOGNIZE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN FUTURE PERIODS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE ACCOUNTING IMPACT HAD THE COMPANY CHOSEN TO APPLY THE FAIR-VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123, INSTEAD OF THE

RECOGNITION PROVISIONS UNDER APB OPINION NO. 25, IS DESCRIBED IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AS

OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD $5.464 BILLION IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AN INCREASE OF $898 MILLION OVER THE SAME BALANCES AT

THE END OF FISCAL 2003. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THIS INCREASE WERE CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $934 MILLION AND PROCEEDS OF $427 MILLION FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON

STOCK UNDER STOCK PLANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH USED TO REPAY THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING DEBT OF $300 MILLION AND PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT OF $176 MILLION. THE

COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY INVESTED IN HIGH CREDIT QUALITY, LIQUID INVESTMENTS. APPROXIMATELY $3.2 BILLION OF THIS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD BY THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXATION ON REPATRIATION TO THE U.S. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT

OF THE ONE-TIME FAVORABLE FOREIGN DIVIDEND PROVISIONS RECENTLY ENACTED AS PART OF THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004, AND MAY DECIDE TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS FROM SOME OF ITS FOREIGN

SUBSIDIARIES.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES ITS EXISTING BALANCES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY ITS WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, STOCK

REPURCHASE ACTIVITY, OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS, AND OTHER LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EXISTING OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

DEBT

IN FEBRUARY 2004, THE COMPANY RETIRED $300 MILLION OF DEBT OUTSTANDING IN THE FORM OF 6.5% UNSECURED NOTES. THE NOTES WERE ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN 1994 AND WERE SOLD

AT 99.9925% OF PAR FOR AN EFFECTIVE YIELD TO MATURITY OF 6.51%. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS NO LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $176 MILLION DURING FISCAL 2004, $104 MILLION OF WHICH WERE FOR RETAIL STORE FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT RELATED TO THE

COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT AND $72 MILLION OF WHICH WERE PRIMARILY FOR CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENTS AND OPERATING FACILITIES ENHANCEMENTS AND EXPANSIONS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES IT WILL UTILIZE APPROXIMATELY $240 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING 2005, APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION OF WHICH IS

EXPECTED TO BE UTILIZED FOR FURTHER EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT AND THE REMAINDER UTILIZED TO SUPPORT NORMAL REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING CAPITAL ASSETS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO GENERAL

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE.

43

STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN

IN JULY 1999, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PLAN FOR THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE UP TO $500 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK. THIS REPURCHASE PLAN DOES

NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES OR ACQUIRE SHARES OVER ANY SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME.

DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE 1.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN SEPTEMBER OF 2003 AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $16.64 PER

SHARE FOR A TOTAL COST OF $25.5 MILLION. IN AUGUST 2003, THE COMPANY SETTLED THIS AGREEMENT PRIOR TO ITS MATURITY, AT WHICH TIME THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $22.81.

OTHER THAN THIS FORWARD PURCHASE TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENGAGED IN ANY TRANSACTIONS TO REPURCHASE ITS COMMON STOCK SINCE FISCAL 2000. SINCE INCEPTION OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN, THE

COMPANY HAD REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 6.55 MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF $217 MILLION. THE COMPANY WAS STILL AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $283 MILLION OF ITS COMMON

STOCK AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY TRANSACTIONS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES WHEREBY THE COMPANY HAS FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, SUBORDINATED RETAINED INTERESTS, DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS OR OTHER CONTINGENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO MATERIAL CONTINUING RISKS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, OR ANY OTHER OBLIGATION UNDER A VARIABLE INTEREST IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITY

THAT PROVIDES FINANCING, LIQUIDITY, MARKET RISK OR CREDIT RISK SUPPORT TO THE COMPANY.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS ON NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES OF APPROXIMATELY $617 MILLION, $436 MILLION OF

WHICH RELATED TO THE LEASE OF RETAIL SPACE AND RELATED FACILITIES. REMAINING TERMS ON THE COMPANY'S EXISTING OPERATING LEASES RANGE FROM 2 TO 16 YEARS.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY UTILIZES SEVERAL CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND TO PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF FINISHED

PRODUCTS. THESE CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ACQUIRE COMPONENTS AND BUILD PRODUCT BASED ON DEMAND INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH TYPICALLY COVERS PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 130 DAYS. THE

COMPANY ALSO OBTAINS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF

PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY'S FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS

FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 130 DAYS. THE NATURE OF THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING COMMITMENTS AND COMPONENT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE

END OF ITS FISCAL 2003. AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD

44

OUTSTANDING

THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING COMMITMENTS AND COMPONENT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY'S ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH COMMITMENTS TO RETURN PROPERTY SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES TO ORIGINAL CONDITION UPON LEASE TERMINATION. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT GROSS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS.

OTHER OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY'S OTHER OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $24 MILLION ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF

AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED

AGAINST ITSELF OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY AND, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, DOES NOT HAVE A LIABILITY RELATED TO UNRESOLVED INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION THAT WOULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE

CONSIDERED TO BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT USE HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CURRENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF ITS

SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND RESELLERS.

THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS

HAS BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DIFFICULT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF THE COMPANY'S EDUCATION CUSTOMERS APPEARED TO BE DELAYING TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE

OVERALL IMPACT OF THE WEAKER ECONOMY AND STATE BUDGET DEFICITS ON THEIR AVAILABLE FUNDING. ALTHOUGH RECENT MACROECONOMIC TRENDS SEEM TO INDICATE AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY, CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY ABOUT

FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO FORECAST FUTURE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND RELATED OPERATING RESULTS. SHOULD GLOBAL AND/OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, DEMAND

FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AS COULD THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF ITS SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND RESELLERS.

WAR, TERRORISM, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES OR OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS COULD DISRUPT SUPPLY, DELIVERY OR DEMAND OF PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S

OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE.

WAR, TERRORISM, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AND OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS WHETHER IN THE U.S. OR ABROAD, HAVE CAUSED AND COULD CONTINUE TO CAUSE DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION TO

INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE BY CREATING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY HAVE A STRONG NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANY, AND THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS OR CUSTOMERS. THE

COMPANY'S MAJOR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERRUPTION BY EARTHQUAKE, FIRE, POWER SHORTAGES, TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER HOSTILE ACTS, LABOR DISPUTES, MEDICAL CONDITIONS, AND OTHER EVENTS

BEYOND ITS CONTROL. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, ITS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

CERTAIN COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS, ARE LOCATED NEAR

45

MAJOR

SEISMIC FAULTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY DOES NOT CARRY EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE FOR DIRECT QUAKE-RELATED LOSSES, THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE OR OTHER NATURAL OR MANMADE DISASTER.

ALTHOUGH

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE OCCURRENCES OR CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH EVENTS, SUCH EVENTS COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE TO

DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS OR TO RECEIVE COMPONENTS FROM ITS SUPPLIERS, AND COULD CREATE DELAYS AND INEFFICIENCIES IN THE COMPANY'S SUPPLY CHAIN. IN ADDITION, SHOULD MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES,

INCLUDING EPIDEMICS, ARISE THE COMPANY COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE NEED FOR MORE STRINGENT EMPLOYEE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS IN THE AVAILABILITY OF FREIGHT SERVICES,

GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS BETWEEN VARIOUS REGIONS, DELAYS IN PRODUCTION RAMPS OF NEW PRODUCTS, AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND

COMPONENT SUPPLIERS. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE EVENTS.

THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED PERIPHERALS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS DIGITAL MUSIC DEVICES AND RELATED SERVICES, IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE

TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE IN THESE MARKETS, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE PRICING PRACTICES, DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGINS, FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW

PRODUCTS, SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT PRICE/PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS, RAPID ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT ADVANCEMENTS BY

COMPETITORS, PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS, AND A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, PRICE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED PERIPHERALS

HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE. THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS WHO SELL WINDOWS AND LINUX BASED PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED THEIR PRODUCT MARGINS IN ORDER TO GAIN OR MAINTAIN

MARKET SHARE IN RESPONSE TO THE WEAKNESS IN DEMAND THAT BEGAN IN THE SECOND HALF OF CALENDAR 2000 FOR PERSONAL COMPUTING PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE

BEEN, AND IN THE

FUTURE MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE AND OTHER INDUSTRY-WIDE PRICING PRESSURES AND DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON GROSS MARGINS.

THE

PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY HAS ALSO BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITY, HARDWARE PERFORMANCE, AND FEATURES BASED ON EXISTING OR EMERGING INDUSTRY

STANDARDS. FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS PLACE MORE RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT ARE SMALLER AND SIMPLER THAN TRADITIONAL

PERSONAL COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH THE COMPANY'S EXISTING PRODUCTS. SEVERAL COMPETITORS OF THE COMPANY HAVE EITHER TARGETED OR ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION TO TARGET CERTAIN OF THE

COMPANY'S KEY MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING CONSUMER, EDUCATION, PROFESSIONAL AND CONSUMER DIGITAL VIDEO EDITING, AND DESIGN AND PUBLISHING. SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS HAVE INTRODUCED OR

ANNOUNCED PLANS TO INTRODUCE DIGITAL MUSIC PRODUCTS AND/OR ONLINE STORES OFFERING DIGITAL MUSIC DISTRIBUTION THAT MIMIC MANY OF THE UNIQUE DESIGN, TECHNICAL FEATURES, AND SOLUTIONS OF THE COMPANY'S

PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, MANY OF WHOM HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, AND TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES, AS WELL AS BROADER PRODUCT LINES AND LARGER

INSTALLED CUSTOMER BASES THAN THOSE OF THE COMPANY. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARDS CONSOLIDATION IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY THAT HAS RESULTED IN LARGER AND POTENTIALLY STRONGER

COMPETITORS IN THE COMPANY'S MARKETS.

THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY MAKER OF HARDWARE USING THE MAC OS. THE MAC OS HAS A MINORITY MARKET SHARE IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET, WHICH IS DOMINATED BY MAKERS OF COMPUTERS UTILIZING

OTHER COMPETING OPERATING SYSTEMS, INCLUDING WINDOWS AND LINUX. THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP

IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PERCEIVED DESIGN AND FUNCTIONAL ADVANTAGES OVER COMPETING PLATFORMS.

46

THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON MARKET OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO DIGITAL MUSIC DISTRIBUTION AND RELATED CONSUMER ELECTRONIC DEVICES, INCLUDING IPODS. THE COMPANY FACES INCREASING COMPETITION FROM

OTHER COMPANIES PROMOTING THEIR OWN DIGITAL MUSIC PRODUCTS AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES AND FREE PEER-TO-PEER MUSIC SERVICES. THESE COMPETITORS INCLUDE BOTH NEW ENTRANTS WITH

NOVEL MARKET APPROACHES, SUCH AS SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES MODELS, AND ALSO LARGER COMPANIES THAT MAY HAVE GREATER TECHNICAL, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER RESOURCES THAN THOSE OF THE COMPANY, AS WELL

AS ESTABLISHED HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND MUSIC CONTENT SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS. FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT EFFECTIVELY COMPETE IN THESE MARKETS OR SUCCESSFULLY DISTRIBUTE AND SELL DIGITAL MUSIC OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE

COMPANY MAY ALSO HAVE TO RESPOND TO PRICE COMPETITION BY LOWERING PRICES AND/OR INCREASING FEATURES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S MUSIC PRODUCT GROSS MARGINS AS WELL AS OVERALL COMPANY

GROSS MARGINS.

THE

COMPANY ALSO FACES INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE U.S. EDUCATION MARKET. SALES IN THE U.S. TO BOTH ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS FOR COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CUSTOMERS, REMAIN A CORE

MARKET FOR THE COMPANY. UNCERTAINTY IN THIS CHANNEL REMAINS AS SEVERAL COMPETITORS OF THE COMPANY HAVE EITHER TARGETED OR ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION TO TARGET THE EDUCATION MARKET FOR PERSONAL

COMPUTERS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S MARKET SHARE. IN AN EFFORT TO REGAIN MARKET SHARE AND REMAIN COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE

ONE-TO-ONE (1:1) LEARNING SOLUTIONS IN EDUCATION. THE COMPANY'S 1:1 LEARNING SOLUTIONS ARE A COMPLETE SOLUTION CONSISTING OF AN IBOOK PORTABLE SYSTEM FOR EVERY STUDENT AND

TEACHER ALONG WITH A WIRELESS NETWORK CONNECTED TO A CENTRAL SERVER. THESE 1:1 LEARNING SOLUTIONS AND OTHER STRATEGIC SALES ARE GENERALLY PRICED MORE AGGRESSIVELY AND COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY

LESS PROFITABILITY OR EVEN IN FINANCIAL LOSSES, PARTICULARLY FOR LARGER DEALS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS TAKEN CERTAIN STEPS TO STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION IN THE EDUCATION MARKET, THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO INCREASE OR MAINTAIN ITS SHARE OF THE EDUCATION MARKET OR EXECUTE PROFITABLY ON LARGE STRATEGIC ARRANGEMENTS. FAILURE TO DO SO MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT

ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY MUST SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND.

DUE TO THE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES, WHICH ARE CHARACTERIZED BY DYNAMIC CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS AND

RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUALLY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES, ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND

FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND UPGRADED VERSIONS OF THE COMPANY'S EXISTING PRODUCTS. THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET ACCEPTANCE; THE COMPANY'S

ABILITY TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, INCLUDING PRODUCTION RAMP ISSUES; THE AVAILABILITY OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR NEW PRODUCTS; THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF INVENTORY

LEVELS IN LINE WITH ANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEMAND; THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN APPROPRIATE QUANTITIES TO MEET ANTICIPATED DEMAND; AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER DEFECTS IN

THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE IN ADVANCE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT THAT NEW PRODUCTS WILL HAVE ON ITS SALES OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, FROM TIME TO TIME, EXPERIENCE QUALITY PROBLEMS THAT CAN RESULT IN DECREASED NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFITS.

THE COMPANY SELLS HIGHLY COMPLEX HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT CAN CONTAIN DEFECTS IN DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE. SOPHISTICATED OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS,

SUCH AS THOSE SOLD BY THE COMPANY, OFTEN CONTAIN "BUGS" THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE WITH THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE. DEFECTS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THE COMPANY PURCHASES FROM

THIRD-PARTIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT AND FIX ALL DEFECTS IN THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IT SELLS.

47

FAILURE

TO DO SO COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE, LOSS OF REPUTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT WARRANTY AND OTHER EXPENSE TO REMEDY.

BECAUSE ORDERS FOR COMPONENTS, AND IN SOME CASES COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE COMPONENTS, MUST BE PLACED IN ADVANCE OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY RISK.

THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE

AND ACCRUES NECESSARY RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION FEES OF ORDERS FOR INVENTORIES THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS INVENTORY AND RELATED PROVISIONS ARE ADEQUATE, GIVEN THE

RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE IN THE COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL INVENTORY AND RELATED

CHARGES. IN ADDITION, SUCH CHARGES HAVE HAD, AND MAY HAVE, A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE

COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S MARKETS ARE VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES,

THERE IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND PRODUCE OR ORDER FROM THIRD PARTIES EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, COMPONENTS

ARE NORMALLY ACQUIRED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF FORMAL PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE

COMPANY'S FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 130 DAYS. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND MAY IN

THE FUTURE BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY LEVELS AND RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO OBTAIN A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS, INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY OR

AVAILABLE ONLY FROM LIMITED SOURCES.

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND ASICS ARE

CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DRAM, AND TFT-LCD FLAT-PANEL DISPLAYS), WHILE CURRENTLY

AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN

INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IN SITUATIONS WHERE A

COMPONENT OR PRODUCT UTILIZES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE SUPPLIERS' YIELDS HAVE MATURED. THE COMPANY AND OTHER PRODUCERS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER

INDUSTRY ALSO COMPETE FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE

PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY INCLUDING CERTAIN MICROPROCESSORS AND ASICS. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF

COMPONENTS OTHER THAN THOSE CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY COMPONENT WERE TO BE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED ON A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE

COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PRODUCE AND MARKET COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY AND DESIRE OF IBM AND FREESCALE SEMICONDUCTOR, INC. (FORMERLY THE SEMICONDUCTOR PRODUCTS

SEGMENT OF MOTOROLA, INC.), THE SOLE SUPPLIERS OF THE POWERPC RISC-BASED MICROPROCESSOR FOR THE COMPANY'S MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, TO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF

MICROPROCESSORS WITH PRICE/PERFORMANCE FEATURES THAT COMPARE FAVORABLY TO THOSE SUPPLIED TO THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS BY INTEL CORPORATION AND OTHER DEVELOPERS AND PRODUCERS OF MICROPROCESSORS USED BY

PERSONAL COMPUTERS USING OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS. FURTHER, DESPITE ITS EFFORTS TO EDUCATE THE MARKETPLACE TO THE CONTRARY, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT MANY OF ITS CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS BELIEVE

THAT THE RELATIVELY SLOWER MHZ

48

RATING

OR CLOCK SPEED OF THE MICROPROCESSORS IT UTILIZES IN ITS MACINTOSH SYSTEMS COMPARES UNFAVORABLY TO THOSE UTILIZED BY OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND TRANSLATES TO SLOWER OVERALL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE.

THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES IN RECENT YEARS WHERE THE INABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE ADVANCED POWERPC MICROPROCESSORS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, IBM IS CURRENTLY THE COMPANY'S SOLE SUPPLIER OF THE POWERPC G5 PROCESSOR, WHICH IS USED IN THE COMPANY'S CURRENT POWER MAC, XSERVE, AND IMAC PRODUCTS.

FREESCALE SEMICONDUCTOR, INC. IS THE SOLE SUPPLIER OF THE G4 PROCESSOR, WHICH IS USED IN THE COMPANY'S EMAC AND PORTABLE PRODUCTS. IBM HAS RECENTLY EXPERIENCED MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS WITH THE

POWERPC G5 PROCESSOR, WHICH RESULTED IN THE COMPANY DELAYING THE SHIPMENT OF VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND CONSTRAINED CERTAIN PRODUCT SHIPMENTS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2004. THE INABILITY OF IBM TO REMEDY

THESE PROBLEMS IN A TIMELY MANNER, AVOID MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS IN THE FUTURE, AND TO DELIVER TO THE COMPANY MICROPROCESSORS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES WITH COMPETITIVE PRICE/PERFORMANCE FEATURES COULD

FURTHER CONSTRAIN SHIPMENTS OF PRODUCTS CONTAINING THE G5 PROCESSOR AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES, MANY OF WHOM ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.

MOST OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS OUTSOURCED MUCH OF ITS TRANSPORTATION AND

LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT. WHILE OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY LOWER THE COST OF OPERATIONS, THEY ALSO REDUCE THE COMPANY'S DIRECT CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT EFFECT SUCH

DIMINISHED CONTROL WILL HAVE ON THE QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF THE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED OR SERVICES RENDERED, OR THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE COMPANY TO RESPOND TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS. MOREOVER,

ALTHOUGH ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUCH MANUFACTURERS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT, THE COMPANY MAY REMAIN AT LEAST INITIALLY RESPONSIBLE TO THE ULTIMATE CONSUMER FOR WARRANTY

SERVICE IN THE EVENT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS. ANY UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEFECT OR WARRANTY LIABILITY, WHETHER PURSUANT TO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR OTHERWISE, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FINAL

ASSEMBLY OF PRODUCTS SOLD BY THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY CONDUCTED IN THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN CORK, IRELAND, AND BY EXTERNAL VENDORS IN FREMONT, CALIFORNIA, FULLERTON, CALIFORNIA,

TAIWAN, KOREA, THE NETHERLANDS, THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC. CURRENTLY, MANUFACTURE OF MANY OF THE COMPONENTS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND FINAL ASSEMBLY OF

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE PRODUCTS INCLUDING POWERBOOKS, IBOOKS, AND THE IPOD IS PERFORMED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN TAIWAN AND CHINA. IF FOR ANY REASON MANUFACTURING OR LOGISTICS IN

ANY OF THESE LOCATIONS IS DISRUPTED BY EVENTS SUCH AS REGIONAL ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, ENVIRONMENTAL, MEDICAL, POLITICAL, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES, OR MILITARY ACTIONS, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER RESELLERS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS AND CATALOGUERS, MANY OF WHOM DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS FROM COMPETING

MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND RESELLS CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO END USERS, CERTAIN EDUCATION CUSTOMERS, AND

CERTAIN RESELLERS THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD AND ITS RETAIL STORES. MANY OF THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT RESELLERS OPERATE ON NARROW PRODUCT MARGINS AND HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY

RECENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL OR CREDIT INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS. THE

COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THESE RESELLERS WEAKEN, IF RESELLERS WITHIN CONSUMER CHANNELS WERE TO CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THE

COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, OR IF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS CAUSED RESELLERS TO

49

REDUCE

THEIR ORDERING AND MARKETING OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE RESELLER SALES, INCLUDING STAFFING SELECTED

RESELLERS' STORES WITH COMPANY EMPLOYEES. THESE PROGRAMS COULD REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT FROM THE COMPANY, WHILE PROVIDING NO ASSURANCE OF RETURN OR INCREMENTAL REVENUE TO OFFSET THIS

INVESTMENT.

OVER

THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF THE COMPANY'S NET SALES HAVE BEEN MADE BY THE COMPANY DIRECTLY TO END-USERS THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD AND THROUGH

ITS RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. AND JAPAN. SOME OF THE COMPANY'S RESELLERS HAVE PERCEIVED THIS EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY'S DIRECT SALES AS CONFLICTING WITH THEIR OWN BUSINESS AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS AS

DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. PERCEPTION OF SUCH A CONFLICT COULD DISCOURAGE THE COMPANY'S RESELLERS FROM INVESTING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF THE

COMPANY'S PRODUCTS OR LEAD THEM TO LIMIT OR CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF EXPANSION OF ITS DIRECT SALES TO

END-USERS CAUSES SOME OR ALL OF ITS RESELLERS TO CEASE OR LIMIT DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS.

FURTHER

INFORMATION REGARDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION MAY BE FOUND IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING "MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION."

THE COMPANY RELIES ON THIRD-PARTY MUSIC CONTENT, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO OFFER THEIR MUSIC CONTENT TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE COMPANY'S ITUNES MUSIC STORE. THE COMPANY PAYS SUBSTANTIAL FEES TO OBTAIN THE

RIGHTS TO OFFER TO ITS CUSTOMERS THIS THIRD-PARTY MUSIC. MANY OF THE COMPANY'S LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THESE THIRD-PARTY

CONTENT PROVIDERS ARE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE AND DO NOT GUARANTEE THE FUTURE RENEWAL OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. CERTAIN PARTIES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY

HAVE ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENT TO CONSOLIDATE THEIR MUSIC DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS, WHICH COULD LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY AND INCREASE THE FEES REQUIRED TO OFFER MUSIC CONTENT TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE ITUNES

MUSIC STORE. FURTHER, SOME THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS CURRENTLY, OR MAY IN THE FUTURE, OFFER MUSIC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT COMPETE WITH THE COMPANY'S MUSIC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND COULD TAKE

ACTION TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO LICENSE THEIR MUSIC CONTENT IN THE FUTURE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF MUSIC CONTENT AT REASONABLE

PRICES WITH ACCEPTABLE USAGE RULES, OR CONTINUE TO EXPAND ITS GEOGRAPHIC REACH OUTSIDE THE U.S., THEN SALES AND GROSS MARGINS OF THE COMPANY'S ITUNES MUSIC STORE AS WELL AS RELATED HARDWARE AND

PERIPHERALS, INCLUDING IPODS, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THIRD-PARTY

CONTENT PROVIDERS AND ARTISTS REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY PROVIDE CERTAIN DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS AND OTHER SECURITY MECHANISMS. IF THE REQUIREMENTS FROM CONTENT PROVIDERS OR

ARTISTS CHANGE, THEN THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO FURTHER DEVELOP OR LICENSE TECHNOLOGY TO ADDRESS SUCH NEW RIGHTS AND REQUIREMENTS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OR

LICENSE SUCH SOLUTIONS AT A REASONABLE COST AND IN A TIMELY MANNER, IF AT ALL, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT UPON SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. IF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS CEASE TO BE DEVELOPED OR AVAILABLE FOR THE

COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS, THEN CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE NOT TO BUY THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DECISIONS BY CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANY'S PERSONAL COMPUTERS, AS OPPOSED TO WINDOWS-BASED SYSTEMS, ARE OFTEN BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF

THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE FOR PARTICULAR APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MICROSOFT OFFICE. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN

PART ON THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS' PERCEPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING, MAINTAINING, AND UPGRADING SUCH SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VERSUS SOFTWARE FOR THE LARGER

WINDOWS MARKET. THIS ANALYSIS IS BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE PERCEIVED STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTS, THE ANTICIPATED POTENTIAL REVENUE THAT MAY BE GENERATED, CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE BY

CUSTOMERS OF MAC OS X, AND THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING SUCH

50

SOFTWARE

PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL LOSSES IN PRIOR YEARS AND THE MINORITY MARKET SHARE HELD BY THE COMPANY IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S DECISION TO

END ITS MAC OS LICENSING PROGRAM, HAVE CAUSED SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO QUESTION THE COMPANY'S PROSPECTS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET, DEVELOPERS COULD BE LESS INCLINED TO DEVELOP NEW APPLICATION

SOFTWARE OR UPGRADE EXISTING SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND MORE INCLINED TO DEVOTE THEIR RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING AND UPGRADING SOFTWARE FOR THE LARGER WINDOWS MARKET. MOREOVER, THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE FOR MAC OS X, THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SYSTEM, ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL.

IN

ADDITION, PAST AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT BY THE COMPANY OF ITS OWN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SOLUTIONS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DECISION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO DEVELOP, MAINTAIN, AND UPGRADE

SIMILAR OR COMPETITIVE SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY MARKETS AND SELLS A VARIETY OF SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR USE BY PROFESSIONALS, CONSUMERS, AND EDUCATION CUSTOMERS THAT

COULD INFLUENCE THE DECISIONS OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO DEVELOP OR UPGRADE MACINTOSH-COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS CURRENTLY MARKETED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE SOFTWARE

FOR PROFESSIONAL FILM AND VIDEO EDITING, PROFESSIONAL COMPOSITING AND VISUAL EFFECTS FOR LARGE FORMAT FILM AND VIDEO PRODUCTIONS, PROFESSIONAL MUSIC PRODUCTION AND MUSIC POST PRODUCTION, PROFESSIONAL

AND CONSUMER DVD ENCODING AND AUTHORING, CONSUMER DIGITAL VIDEO AND DIGITAL PHOTO EDITING AND MANAGEMENT, DIGITAL MUSIC MANAGEMENT, DESKTOP-BASED DATABASE MANAGEMENT, AND HIGH-QUALITY

PRESENTATIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO MARKETS AN INTEGRATED PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATION THAT INCORPORATES WORD PROCESSING, PAGE LAYOUT, IMAGE MANIPULATION, SPREADSHEETS, DATABASES, AND PRESENTATIONS IN A

SINGLE APPLICATION.

IN

AUGUST 1997, THE COMPANY AND MICROSOFT CORPORATION ENTERED INTO PATENT CROSS LICENSE AND TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENTS. IN ADDITION, FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS THROUGH AUGUST 2002, AND

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF MACINTOSH COMPUTERS SOLD BY THE COMPANY, MICROSOFT WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE VERSIONS OF ITS MICROSOFT OFFICE AND INTERNET EXPLORER PRODUCTS FOR THE

MAC OS. ALTHOUGH MICROSOFT HAS RELEASED MICROSOFT OFFICE AND INTERNET EXPLORER FOR MAC OS X, MICROSOFT HAS NOT BEEN OBLIGATED TO PRODUCE FUTURE VERSIONS OF ITS PRODUCTS SUBSEQUENT TO

AUGUST 2002. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH MICROSOFT HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANY AND TO ITS EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE INSTALLED BASE FOR THE MAC

OS, THE COMPANY DOES COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH MICROSOFT IN A NUMBER OF KEY AREAS. ACCORDINGLY, MICROSOFT'S INTEREST IN PRODUCING APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR THE MAC OS FOLLOWING EXPIRATION OF THE AGREEMENTS

MAY BE INFLUENCED BY MICROSOFT'S PERCEPTION OF ITS INTERESTS AS THE VENDOR OF THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM AND COMPETING DIGITAL MEDIA APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING MUSIC DISTRIBUTION SERVICE AND

TECHNOLOGY. IN JUNE OF 2003, MICROSOFT STATED THAT IT WOULD NO LONGER DEVELOP NEW VERSIONS OF INTERNET EXPLORER FOR THE MAC OS, SUBSEQUENT TO THE COMPANY'S INTRODUCTION DURING 2003 OF ITS OWN WEB

BROWSER, SAFARI. FURTHER DISCONTINUANCE OF PRODUCTS FOR THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM, INCLUDING MICROSOFT OFFICE AND OTHER MICROSOFT PRODUCTS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S NET SALES AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS RELIES ON ACCESS TO PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND THE COMPANY'S FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF IT IS

ALLEGED OR FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.

MANY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD-PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES

RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY

REASONABLE TERMS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE OR AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.

BECAUSE

OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES, CURRENT EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE CERTAIN

COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE EXISTING PATENTS OF OTHERS. THE COMPANY HAS FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS

OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL

51

PROPERTY

RIGHTS OF OTHERS. RESPONDING TO SUCH CLAIMS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR MERIT, CAN BE TIME CONSUMING, RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, AND CAUSE THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL.

SEVERAL PENDING CLAIMS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EVALUATION. THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER THE DESIRABILITY OF ENTERING INTO LICENSING AGREEMENTS IN CERTAIN OF THESE CASES. HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE

GIVEN THAT SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR THAT LITIGATION WILL NOT OCCUR. IN THE EVENT THERE IS A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION ENTERED PROHIBITING THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING

OR SELLING CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS OR A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT AGAINST THE COMPANY REQUIRING IT TO PAY ROYALTIES TO A THIRD-PARTY, THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INVOLVING THE COMPANY RELATED TO ALLEGED PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND OTHER MATTERS IS SET FORTH IN PART I,

ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES FROM ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS RELATED

TO THE INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THE MATTERS RELATED TO INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING

PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY'S RETAIL INITIATIVE HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT AND COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES AND IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES.

THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY HAS OPENED 86 RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANY'S RETAIL INITIATIVE HAS REQUIRED SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD

IMPROVEMENTS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INVENTORY, AND PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO ENTERED INTO SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS FOR RETAIL SPACE WITH LEASE TERMS RANGING FROM 5 TO

16 YEARS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE FOR 10 YEARS. THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS SHOULD IT CHOOSE TO TERMINATE THIS INITIATIVE OR CLOSE INDIVIDUAL STORES. SUCH COSTS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ADDITIONALLY, A RELATIVELY HIGH PROPORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S COSTS ARE FIXED BECAUSE OF DEPRECIATION ON STORE

CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND LEASE EXPENSE. AS A RESULT, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES WOULD RESULT SHOULD THE RETAIL SEGMENT EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN SALES FOR ANY REASON.

CERTAIN

OF THE COMPANY'S STORES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SERVE AS HIGH PROFILE VENUES THAT FUNCTION AS VEHICLES FOR GENERAL CORPORATE MARKETING, CORPORATE EVENTS, AND BRAND AWARENESS. BECAUSE

OF THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN ELEMENTS, LOCATIONS AND SIZE, THESE STORES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS THAN THE COMPANY'S MORE TYPICAL RETAIL STORES. THE

COMPANY HAS OPENED SEVEN SUCH STORES THROUGH NOVEMBER 2004. BECAUSE OF THEIR LOCATION AND SIZE, THESE HIGH

PROFILE STORES ALSO REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO ENTER INTO SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS COMPARED TO THOSE REQUIRED FOR ITS MORE TYPICAL STORES. CURRENT LEASES ON SUCH LOCATIONS HAVE

TERMS RANGING FROM 10 TO 16 YEARS WITH TOTAL COMMITMENTS PER LOCATION OVER THE LEASE TERMS RANGING FROM $25 MILLION TO $50 MILLION. CLOSURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF THESE

HIGH PROFILE STORES COULD HAVE A PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MANY

OF THE GENERAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THE COMPANY FACES COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS RETAIL SEGMENT. ALSO, MANY FACTORS UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS PRESENT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES,

SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S FUTURE RESULTS, CAUSE ITS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY EXPECTED, AND/OR HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RETAIL SEGMENT INCLUDE, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON GENERAL RETAIL ACTIVITY; INABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STORE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION; LACK OF CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF

THE COMPANY'S RETAIL APPROACH; FAILURE TO ATTRACT NEW USERS TO THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM; INABILITY TO SELL THIRD-PARTY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AT ADEQUATE MARGINS; FAILURE TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS

WITH EXISTING RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS; LACK OF EXPERIENCE

52

IN

MANAGING RETAIL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S.; COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY RETAIL INVENTORY; AND INABILITY TO OBTAIN QUALITY RETAIL

LOCATIONS AT REASONABLE COST.

INVESTMENT IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANY'S ONGOING BUSINESS AND MAY PRESENT RISKS NOT ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED.

THE COMPANY MAY DECIDE TO INVEST IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES OR ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS THAT COMPLEMENT THE COMPANY'S STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND PRODUCT ROADMAP. SUCH ENDEAVORS MAY

INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING DISTRACTION OF MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION AWAY FROM NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS; INSUFFICIENT REVENUE GENERATION TO OFFSET LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRATEGY; AND UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES NOT DISCOVERED IN THE COMPANY'S DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS. BECAUSE THESE NEW VENTURES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT

SUCH STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS, OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DECLINES IN THE SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS OR INCREASES IN SALES OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IPODS, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S GROSS MARGIN AND

OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES

UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS, INCLUDING POWER MACINTOSH AND POWERBOOK SYSTEMS, GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER GROSS MARGINS THAN THE COMPANY'S CONSUMER PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING IMACS, IBOOKS, IPODS, AND CONTENT FROM THE ITUNES MUSIC STORE. A SHIFT IN SALES MIX AWAY FROM HIGHER MARGIN

PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS TOWARDS LOWER MARGIN CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES. THE COMPANY'S TRADITIONAL PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS

MAY CHOOSE TO BUY CONSUMER PRODUCTS, SPECIFICALLY THE IMAC G5 AND IBOOK, INSTEAD OF PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS. PROFESSIONAL USERS MAY CHOOSE TO BUY THE IMAC G5 DUE TO ITS RELATIVE PRICE PERFORMANCE, USE

OF THE SAME POWERPC G5 PROCESSOR USED IN THE COMPANY'S POWER MACS, AND UNIQUE DESIGN FEATURING A FLAT PANEL SCREEN. POTENTIAL POWERBOOK CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO CHOOSE TO PURCHASE IBOOKS INSTEAD DUE TO

THEIR PRICE PERFORMANCE AND SCREEN SIZE. ADDITIONALLY, SIGNIFICANT FUTURE GROWTH IN IPOD SALES WITHOUT CORRESPONDING GROWTH IN HIGHER MARGIN PRODUCT SALES COULD ALSO REDUCE GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING

MARGIN PERCENTAGES.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS ARE HAVING A PRONOUNCED NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ITS PROFESSIONAL AND CREATIVE CUSTOMERS WHO ARE SIGNIFICANT USERS OF ITS

PROFESSIONAL SYSTEMS. ALSO, IT IS LIKELY THAT MANY OF THE COMPANY'S CURRENT AND POTENTIAL PROFESSIONAL, CREATIVE, AND SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO UTILIZE PROFESSIONAL SYSTEMS,

BELIEVE THAT THE RELATIVELY SLOWER MHZ RATING OR CLOCK SPEED OF THE MICROPROCESSORS THE COMPANY UTILIZES IN ITS MACINTOSH SYSTEMS COMPARES UNFAVORABLY TO THOSE UTILIZED BY OTHER COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS

AND TRANSLATES TO SLOWER OVERALL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. THESE FACTORS MAY RESULT IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT TO SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS AS WELL AS TO GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN

PERCENTAGES.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS QUARTERLY REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.

THE COMPANY'S PROFIT MARGINS VARY AMONG ITS PRODUCTS AND ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE COMPANY'S DIRECT SALES, PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES, GENERALLY HAVE

HIGHER ASSOCIATED PROFITABILITY THAN ITS INDIRECT SALES. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY'S DIRECT CHANNELS HAVE TRADITIONALLY HAD MORE SALES OF SOFTWARE AND HIGHER PRICED HARDWARE PRODUCTS, WHICH GENERALLY

HAVE HIGHER GROSS MARGINS, THAN THROUGH ITS INDIRECT CHANNELS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES AS WELL AS OVERALL PROFITABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS A

RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIC OR CHANNEL MIX. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY GENERALLY SELLS MORE PRODUCTS DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF EACH QUARTER THAN IT DOES DURING EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO

MONTHS, A PATTERN TYPICAL IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY. THIS SALES PATTERN CAN PRODUCE PRESSURE ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF A QUARTER AND MAY ADVERSELY

IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PREDICT ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS ACCURATELY. DEVELOPMENTS LATE IN A QUARTER, SUCH AS LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, AN

INTERNAL SYSTEMS FAILURE, OR FAILURE OF ONE OF THE COMPANY'S KEY LOGISTICS, COMPONENTS SUPPLIERS, OR MANUFACTURING PARTNERS, CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THE COMPANY AND ITS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

53

THE COMPANY HAS HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, THAN MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS.

THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AND MAINTAIN ATTRACTIVE GROSS MARGINS AND REVENUE GROWTH IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY

FLOW OF INNOVATIVE AND COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY INCURS HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE THAN ITS COMPETITORS

WHO SELL PERSONAL COMPUTERS BASED ON OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS. MANY OF THESE COMPETITORS SEEK TO COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY ON PRICE AND MAINTAIN VERY LOW COST STRUCTURES. FURTHER, AS A RESULT OF THE

EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MARKETING THE COMPANY'S BRAND INCLUDING ITS UNIQUE OPERATING SYSTEM, THE COMPANY INCURS HIGHER SELLING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF

REVENUE THAN MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND SELL INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS WITH ATTRACTIVE GROSS MARGINS, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ITS OPERATING COST STRUCTURE.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES. THIS RISK IS HEIGHTENED DURING PERIODS WHEN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORSEN.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER RESELLERS AND RETAILERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. A

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL OR CREDIT INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS UNSECURED NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF

ITS MANUFACTURING VENDORS RESULTING FROM THE SALE BY THE COMPANY OF RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS TO THESE MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE

COMPANY. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO MONITOR AND LIMIT EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE AND NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH PROCEDURES WILL

BE EFFECTIVE IN LIMITING ITS CREDIT RISK AND AVOIDING LOSSES. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND REGIONAL ECONOMIES FAIL TO IMPROVE OR CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE, IT BECOMES MORE LIKELY THAT THE

COMPANY WILL INCUR A MATERIAL LOSS OR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE OF ITS CUSTOMERS OR MANUFACTURING VENDORS.

THE COMPANY'S SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MEMBERS OF ITS

EXECUTIVE TEAM, AND THOSE IN TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF POSITIONS. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE,

ESPECIALLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY, WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S KEY EMPLOYEES ARE LOCATED. THE COMPANY HAS RELIED ON ITS ABILITY TO GRANT STOCK OPTIONS AS ONE MECHANISM FOR RECRUITING AND

RETAINING THIS HIGHLY SKILLED TALENT. POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING REGULATIONS REQUIRING THE EXPENSING OF STOCK OPTIONS MAY IMPAIR THE COMPANY'S FUTURE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THESE INCENTIVES WITHOUT INCURRING

SIGNIFICANT COMPENSATION COSTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF INSURANCE.

THE COMPANY HAS OBSERVED RAPIDLY CHANGING CONDITIONS IN THE INSURANCE MARKETS RELATING TO NEARLY ALL AREAS OF TRADITIONAL COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. SUCH CONDITIONS HAVE AND MAY

CONTINUE TO RESULT IN HIGHER PREMIUM COSTS, HIGHER POLICY DEDUCTIBLES, LOWER COVERAGE LIMITS AND MAY ALSO YIELD POSSIBLE POLICY FORM EXCLUSIONS. FOR SOME RISKS, BECAUSE OF COST AND/OR AVAILABILITY,

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE. BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS SOME PORTION OF ITS INSURABLE RISKS, AND IN SOME CASES SELF INSURES COMPLETELY, UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC LOSSES IN EXCESS OF

INSURED LIMITS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

FAILURE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND BREACHES IN THE SECURITY OF DATA UPON WHICH THE COMPANY RELIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES AND BREACHES OF DATA SECURITY COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO FUNCTION IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS BY POTENTIALLY CAUSING

DELAYS OR CANCELLATION OF CUSTOMER

54

ORDERS,

IMPEDING THE MANUFACTURE OR SHIPMENT OF PRODUCTS, OR RESULTING IN THE UNINTENTIONAL DISCLOSURE OF CUSTOMER OR COMPANY INFORMATION. MANAGEMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS FOR ITS

OWN SYSTEMS BY IMPLEMENTING SOPHISTICATED NETWORK SECURITY AND INTERNAL CONTROL MEASURES. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A SYSTEM FAILURE OR DATA SECURITY BREACH OF THE COMPANY OR A

THIRD-PARTY VENDOR WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

A LARGE PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND LABOR CONDITIONS, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, TAX LAWS (INCLUDING U.S. TAXES ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES), AND

CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS THE LOCAL CURRENCY IN WHICH THE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AND GOODS AND SERVICES ARE PURCHASED. THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES RELATE TO NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED SALES IN EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, AND CERTAIN PARTS OF ASIA AND NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED OPERATING EXPENSES INCURRED

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WEAKNESSES IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PARTICULARLY THE JAPANESE YEN AND THE EURO, CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE

COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES. CONVERSELY, STRENGTHENING IN THESE AND OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCIES CAN INCREASE THE COST TO THE COMPANY OF PRODUCT COMPONENTS, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

MARGINS

ON SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES.

DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS HAVE BEEN UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE EXPOSURES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF SUCH

HEDGING ACTIVITIES MAY NOT OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.

FURTHER

INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL MARKET RISKS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 7A OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE SUBHEADING "FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK" AND

MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTES 1 AND 2 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.

PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE

REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO RETURN PRODUCT AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND

REGULATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PASSED IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, INCLUDING VARIOUS EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER COUNTRIES, JAPAN AND CERTAIN STATES WITHIN THE U.S. IN THE FUTURE,

THESE LAWS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING RULES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THESE PRINCIPLES ARE SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION BY VARIOUS GOVERNING BODIES,

INCLUDING THE FASB AND THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC), WHO INTERPRET AND CREATE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING REGULATIONS. A CHANGE FROM CURRENT ACCOUNTING REGULATIONS, INCLUDING ACCOUNTING FOR

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND COULD IMPACT THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY CONDUCTS BUSINESS.

55

UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S TAX RATES COULD AFFECT ITS FUTURE RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE FAVORABLY OR UNFAVORABLY AFFECTED BY UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX

RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF THE COMPANY'S DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR BY CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS

EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO

DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE.

THE COMPANY'S STOCK HAS AT TIMES EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY AS A RESULT OF VARIATIONS BETWEEN ITS ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND AS A RESULT OF

ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND ITS COMPETITORS. THE STOCK MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN WAYS THAT

HAVE BEEN UNRELATED TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THESE COMPANIES. THESE FACTORS, INCLUDING LACK OF POSITIVE PERFORMANCE IN THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE, AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL

CONDITIONS AND INVESTORS' CONCERNS REGARDING THE CREDIBILITY OF CORPORATE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND INTEGRITY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S

STOCK IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE MAY RESULT IN GREATER DILUTION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE.

56

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS AND ITS INTEREST RATE SWAP AND OPTION POSITIONS, BOTH ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS AND IN CONJUNCTION

WITH ITS UNDERLYING FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE RELATED EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE EFFECTIVE HORIZONS OF THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE ANTICIPATORY NATURE OF THE

EXPOSURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE

HEDGES WILL OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM MOVEMENTS IN EITHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE OR INTEREST RATES. IN ADDITION, THE TIMING OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR RECOGNITION OF GAINS

AND LOSSES RELATED TO MARK-TO-MARKET INSTRUMENTS FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD MAY NOT COINCIDE WITH THE TIMING OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC EXPOSURES AND,

THEREFORE, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

INTEREST RATE RISK

WHILE THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN MANY OF THE WORLD'S LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY'S INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE IS MOST SENSITIVE

TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE GENERAL LEVEL OF U.S. INTEREST RATES. IN THIS REGARD, CHANGES IN U.S. INTEREST RATES AFFECT THE INTEREST EARNED ON THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES.

THE

COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT POLICY AND STRATEGY IS TO ENSURE THE PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL, MEET LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, AND OPTIMIZE RETURN IN LIGHT OF CURRENT CREDIT AND INTEREST

RATE TRENDS. THE COMPANY BENCHMARKS ITS PERFORMANCE BY UTILIZING EXTERNAL MONEY MANAGERS TO MANAGE A SMALL PORTION OF THE AGGREGATE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE EXTERNAL MANAGERS ADHERE TO THE COMPANY'S

INVESTMENT POLICIES AND ALSO PROVIDE OCCASIONAL RESEARCH AND MARKET INFORMATION THAT SUPPLEMENTS INTERNAL RESEARCH USED TO MAKE CREDIT DECISIONS IN THE INVESTMENT PROCESS.

THE

COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY PLACES ITS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN HIGHLY LIQUID

SECURITIES ISSUED BY HIGH CREDIT QUALITY ISSUERS AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE COMPANY'S GENERAL POLICY IS TO LIMIT THE RISK OF PRINCIPAL LOSS AND ENSURE

THE SAFETY OF INVESTED FUNDS BY LIMITING MARKET AND CREDIT RISK. ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS; HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS

WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, APPROXIMATELY $180 MILLION OF THE COMPANY'S

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES RANGING FROM 1 TO 5 YEARS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, $629 MILLION OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CLASSIFIED AS

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HAD MATURITIES RANGING FROM 1 TO 5 YEARS. THE REMAINDER ALL HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES BETWEEN 3 AND 12 MONTHS. THE COMPANY MAY SELL ITS INVESTMENTS

PRIOR TO THEIR STATED MATURITIES, DUE TO LIQUIDITY NEEDS, IN ANTICIPATION OF CREDIT DETERIORATION, OR FOR DURATION MANAGEMENT. AS A RESULT OF SUCH ACTIVITY, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET GAINS OF

$1 MILLION IN 2004, $21 MILLION IN 2003, AND $7 MILLION IN 2002.

IN

ORDER TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT THAT A

CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ASSUMING A 100 BASIS POINT PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE. BASED ON INVESTMENT POSITIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 25,

2004, A HYPOTHETICAL 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS ALL MATURITIES WOULD RESULT IN A $14.4 MILLION DECLINE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, A SIMILAR 100 BASIS POINT SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A $12.9 MILLION DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE. SUCH LOSSES WOULD ONLY BE

REALIZED IF THE COMPANY SOLD THE INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO MATURITY. EXCEPT IN INSTANCES NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY'S POLICY IS TO HOLD INVESTMENTS TO MATURITY.

FROM

TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER MATCH THE COMPANY'S FLOATING-RATE INTEREST INCOME ON

ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS

57

AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH ITS FIXED-RATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON ITS DEBT, AND/OR TO DIVERSIFY A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE AWAY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN

SHORT-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY DID NOT ENTER INTO ANY INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES DURING 2004 OR 2003 AND HAD NO OPEN INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES AT SEPTEMBER 25, 2004.

IN

PRIOR YEARS, THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE DEBT SWAPS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. THE INTEREST RATE DEBT SWAPS REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO PAY A FLOATING INTEREST RATE BASED ON THE THREE-

OR SIX-MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AND RECEIVE A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST WITHOUT EXCHANGES OF THE UNDERLYING NOTIONAL AMOUNTS. THESE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED THE COMPANY'S

FIXED-RATE 10-YEAR DEBT TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT. DUE TO PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES, DURING 2001 AND 2002 THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED

OUT INTEREST RATE DEBT SWAP POSITIONS REALIZING GAINS OF $23 MILLION. THE GAINS WERE DEFERRED, RECOGNIZED IN LONG-TERM DEBT AND WERE AMORTIZED TO OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE OVER THE

REMAINING LIFE OF THE DEBT.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY IS A NET RECEIVER OF CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, AND IN PARTICULAR A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S.

DOLLAR, MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S NET SALES AND GROSS MARGINS AS EXPRESSED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THERE IS ALSO A RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL HAVE TO ADJUST LOCAL CURRENCY PRODUCT PRICING DUE TO

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WHEN THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE

COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN

FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY'S PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY OF ITS EXISTING MATERIAL FOREIGN

EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY NOT HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES DUE TO IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES, AND

LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

IN

ORDER TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE POSITIONS, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

USING A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES. THE VAR MODEL CONSISTED OF USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TO GENERATE 3000

RANDOM MARKET PRICE PATHS. THE VAR IS THE MAXIMUM EXPECTED LOSS IN FAIR VALUE, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, TO THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN RATES. THE VAR

MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE MODEL ASSUMES NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE MODEL, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR

VALUE OF $3.2 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004 COMPARED TO A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS OF $7.5 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003. BECAUSE THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN

CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS FOR HEDGING PURPOSES, LOSSES INCURRED ON THOSE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES.

ACTUAL

GAINS AND LOSSES IN THE FUTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED AS OF

SEPTEMBER 25, 2004 DUE TO THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PREDICTING THE CHANGES IN THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGES RATES, AND THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL

EXPOSURES AND POSITIONS.

DESIGNS, DEVELOPS AND MARKETS A LINE OF PORTABLE DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS ALONG WITH RELATED ACCESSORIES AND SERVICES INCLUDING THE ONLINE DISTRIBUTION OF THIRD-PARTY MUSIC AND AUDIO BOOKS. THE COMPANY

SELLS ITS PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES, ITS OWN RETAIL STORES, ITS DIRECT SALES FORCE AND THIRD-PARTY WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS AND VALUE ADDED RESELLERS. IN ADDITION TO ITS OWN HARDWARE,

SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY SELLS A VARIETY OF THIRD-PARTY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THROUGH ITS ONLINE AND RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANY SELLS TO EDUCATION, CONSUMER, CREATIVE

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE PREPARATION OF THESE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THESE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES

THERETO HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

TYPICALLY,

THE COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF SEPTEMBER. FISCAL YEARS 2004, 2003 AND 2002 WERE EACH 52-WEEK YEARS. HOWEVER, APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS, THE COMPANY

REPORTS A 53-WEEK FISCAL YEAR TO ALIGN ITS FISCAL QUARTERS WITH CALENDAR QUARTERS BY ADDING A WEEK TO ITS FIRST FISCAL QUARTER. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ADD THIS ADDITIONAL WEEK IN ITS FIRST

FISCAL QUARTER OF 2006. ALL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN IS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S FISCAL CALENDAR.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS. HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES

GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE

TIME OF PURCHASE AND REEVALUATES SUCH DESIGNATION AS OF EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE COMPANY'S DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. THESE SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH THE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. THE COST OF

SECURITIES SOLD IS BASED UPON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY

ON MAY 15, 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 150,

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF

BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY

. SFAS NO. 150 REQUIRES ISSUERS TO CLASSIFY AS

LIABILITIES (OR ASSETS IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES) CERTAIN FREESTANDING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT EMBODY OBLIGATIONS FOR THE ISSUER AND HAVE CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY. THE COMPANY

ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 150 ON JUNE 29, 2003, WHICH RESULTED IN A FAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT TYPE ADJUSTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION. THIS ADJUSTMENT RELATED TO A

FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT THAT ALLOWED THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE 1.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $16.64 PER SHARE FOR A TOTAL COST OF $25.5 MILLION. THE

COMPANY SETTLED THIS FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT IN AUGUST 2003, WHICH RESULTED IN AN ADDITIONAL GAIN OF

64

APPROXIMATELY

$6 MILLION REPRESENTING THE INCREASE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE AGREEMENT FROM JUNE 29, 2003 THROUGH THE SETTLEMENT DATE.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND CARRIES THEM AT FAIR VALUE. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT HEDGES MUST BE ADJUSTED TO FAIR

VALUE THROUGH INCOME. IF THE DERIVATIVE IS A HEDGE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE HEDGE, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WILL EITHER BE OFFSET AGAINST THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, OR FIRM COMMITMENTS THROUGH EARNINGS, OR RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL THE HEDGED ITEM IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS REPORTED

AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. TO RECEIVE HEDGE

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES TO EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE

TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY AND THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS ON THE

HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT THAT IS DESIGNATED AS AN ECONOMIC

HEDGE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EXPOSURE OF THE NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION IS REPORTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS A FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. FOR FORWARD CONTRACTS

DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THE COMPANY EXCLUDES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RELATING TO CHANGES IN THE FORWARD CARRY COMPONENT FROM ITS DEFINITION OF EFFECTIVENESS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY GAINS OR

LOSSES RELATED TO THIS COMPONENT ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT

PERIOD.

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 133, HEDGES RELATED TO PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS OF AN ANTICIPATORY NATURE ARE DESIGNATED AND DOCUMENTED AT HEDGE INCEPTION AS CASH FLOW HEDGES

AND EVALUATED FOR HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS QUARTERLY. FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

CONTRACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE FORWARD EXCHANGE RATE. CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON THE FORECASTED HEDGED TRANSACTION AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD HEDGE ARE

BOTH MEASURED FROM THE CONTRACT RATE TO THE FORWARD EXCHANGE RATE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORWARD CONTRACT'S MATURITY DATE. FOR CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BY COMPARING THE

PRESENT VALUE OF THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON THE HEDGED TRANSACTION TO CHANGES IN EXPECTED CASH FLOW OF THE OPTION HEDGE AT MATURITY. THE NET GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS QUALIFYING AS CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE REPORTED AS COMPONENTS OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH

THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. ANY HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. FOR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS QUALIFYING AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE

COMPANY ASSUMES NO INEFFECTIVENESS BECAUSE THESE SWAPS MEET THE CRITERIA FOR ACCOUNTING UNDER THE SHORT-CUT METHOD.

THE

COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE TRANSLATION AND ECONOMIC EXPOSURE OF A NET INVESTMENT POSITION IN A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY. FOR SUCH CONTRACTS, HEDGE

EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE SPOT EXCHANGE RATE. THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT

DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF THE NET INVESTMENT POSITION IN A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY IS REPORTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS A FOREIGN CURRENCY

65

TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENT. ANY RESIDUAL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACT, INCLUDING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE SPOT AND FORWARD EXCHANGE RATES, ARE

RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET. IF THE COST OF THE INVENTORIES EXCEEDS THEIR MARKET VALUE, PROVISIONS ARE

MADE CURRENTLY FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND THE MARKET VALUE.

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED BY USE OF THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH

ARE 30 YEARS FOR BUILDINGS, FROM 2 TO 5 YEARS FOR EQUIPMENT, AND THE SHORTER OF LEASE TERMS OR 10 YEARS FOR LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES ELIGIBLE COSTS TO

ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE THAT ARE INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE. CAPITALIZED COSTS RELATED TO INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE ARE AMORTIZED USING

THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH RANGE FROM 3 TO 5 YEARS.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

, WHICH

ADDRESSES FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT COSTS. THE STANDARD APPLIES TO

LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT RESULT FROM THE ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT AND/OR NORMAL USE OF THE ASSETS. SFAS NO. 143

REQUIRES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT IS INCURRED IF A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE CAN BE MADE. THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE LIABILITY IS ADDED TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSOCIATED ASSET AND THIS ADDITIONAL CARRYING AMOUNT IS DEPRECIATED OVER THE LIFE OF THE ASSET. ALL OF THE COMPANY'S EXISTING ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS ARE

ASSOCIATED WITH COMMITMENTS TO RETURN PROPERTY SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES TO ORIGINAL CONDITION UPON LEASE TERMINATION. THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THAT AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2002, GROSS EXPECTED

FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF $9.5 MILLION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS.

AS

OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $6 MILLION LONG-TERM ASSET RETIREMENT LIABILITY AND A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE

PRESENT VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH RETURNING CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S LEASED PROPERTIES TO ORIGINAL CONDITION. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROSS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOW OF

$9.5 MILLION AND ITS PRESENT VALUE OF $6 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2002, IS BEING ACCRETED OVER THE LIFE OF THE RELATED LEASES AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE. NET OF THE RELATED INCOME

TAX EFFECT OF APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION, ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 143 RESULTED IN AN UNFAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT TYPE ADJUSTMENT TO NET INCOME DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003 OF

APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION. THIS ADJUSTMENT REPRESENTS CUMULATIVE DEPRECIATION AND ACCRETION THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED THROUGH THE DATE OF ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 143 HAD THE STATEMENT

BEEN APPLIED TO THE COMPANY'S EXISTING ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AT THE TIME THEY WERE INITIALLY INCURRED.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES, EXCLUDING GOODWILL, FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF THESE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO

GENERATE. IF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED EQUALS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2002 THE COMPANY HAD NO MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT OF ITS

LONG-LIVED ASSETS, EXCEPT FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5.

THE

COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2002. SFAS NO. 142 REQUIRES THAT

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR SOONER WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THEY MAY BE IMPAIRED. PRIOR TO FISCAL 2002, GOODWILL WAS AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER ITS ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS TRANSITIONAL

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2001, AND ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON AUGUST 30 OF EACH YEAR THEREAFTER AND FOUND NO IMPAIRMENT. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED REPORTING

UNITS BASED ON ITS CURRENT REPORTING STRUCTURE. FOR PURPOSES OF TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, GOODWILL HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THESE REPORTING UNITS TO THE EXTENT IT RELATES TO EACH REPORTING UNIT.

SFAS

NO. 142 ALSO REQUIRES THAT INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF

. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

AMORTIZING ITS ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM 3 TO 10 YEARS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE COMPANY TRANSLATES THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS INTERNATIONAL NON-U.S. FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT

THE END OF EACH PERIOD. REVENUE AND EXPENSES FOR THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED USING RATES THAT APPROXIMATE THOSE IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSLATIONS ARE CREDITED

OR CHARGED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCLUDED IN "ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)" IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN MANUFACTURING SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN OTHER

INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES THAT USE THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REMEASURE MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD, AND INVENTORIES,

PROPERTY, AND NONMONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT HISTORICAL RATES. GAINS AND

67

LOSSES

FROM THESE TRANSLATIONS WERE INSIGNIFICANT AND HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS (HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND PERIPHERALS), AND EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES

REVENUE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, INCLUDING STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) NO. 97-2,

SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION

, AS

AMENDED, AND SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 104,

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED

DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED.

FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY

LEGALLY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. IF AT THE OUTSET OF AN ARRANGEMENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS NOT, OR IS PRESUMED TO NOT BE, FIXED OR

DETERMINABLE, REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED AS AMOUNTS BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE.

REVENUE

FROM EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE WARRANTY AND SUPPORT PERIODS. THESE CONTRACTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE EXTENDED PHONE SUPPORT, CERTAIN

REPAIRS, WEB-BASED SUPPORT RESOURCES, DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, AND EXTEND THE COMPANY'S ONE-YEAR BASIC LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY.

THE

COMPANY SELLS SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES ITS OWN PRICING AND RETAINS RELATED INVENTORY RISK, IS THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR IN SALES

TRANSACTIONS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS, AND ASSUMES THE CREDIT RISK FOR AMOUNTS BILLED TO ITS CUSTOMERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OTHER COMPANIES AT

THE GROSS AMOUNT BILLED.

REVENUE

ON ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS SUCH AS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES IS ALLOCATED TO EACH ELEMENT BASED ON THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OF EACH ELEMENT, WHICH IS GENERALLY

DETERMINED BY VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE). ALLOCATED REVENUE FOR EACH ELEMENT IS RECOGNIZED WHEN REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET FOR EACH ELEMENT. VSOE IS DETERMINED BASED ON

THE PRICE CHARGED WHEN EACH ELEMENT IS SOLD SEPARATELY.

THE

COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING RESELLER AND END USER REBATES, AND OTHER SALES PROGRAMS

AND VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES. THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS ACCRUED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE IN THE PERIOD THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT AND COMMITTED TO A PLAN. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS

REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE.

GENERALLY,

THE COMPANY DOES NOT OFFER SPECIFIED OR UNSPECIFIED UPGRADE RIGHTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS IN CONNECTION WITH SOFTWARE SALES OR THE SALE OF EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, A

LIMITED NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE WITH MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS THAT GRANT CUSTOMERS RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED FUTURE UPGRADES OVER THE MAINTENANCE TERM ON A WHEN AND IF

AVAILABLE BASIS. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH MAINTENANCE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE MAINTENANCE TERM.

68

SHIPPING COSTS

THE COMPANY'S SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

WARRANTY EXPENSE

THE COMPANY PROVIDES CURRENTLY FOR THE ESTIMATED COST FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED OR OTHERWISE MARKETED ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITALIZATION BEGINNING

WHEN A PRODUCT'S TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ENDING WHEN A PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 86,

COMPUTER

SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE MARKETED

. IN MOST INSTANCES, THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED SOON AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. THEREFORE,

COSTS INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY ARE USUALLY NOT SIGNIFICANT, AND GENERALLY ALL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS HAVE BEEN EXPENSED.

DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X VERSION 10.4 (CODE-NAMED "TIGER"), WHICH ENHANCES THE

FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY OF THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF MAC OS X, SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS EVIDENCED BY PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION IN AUGUST 2004 AND SUBSEQUENT RELEASE

OF A DEVELOPER BETA VERSION OF THE PRODUCT, BOTH OF WHICH WERE PRIOR TO THE PLANNED RELEASE OF THE FINAL VERSION OF THE PRODUCT IN THE FIRST HALF OF CALENDAR YEAR 2005. THEREFORE, DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED APPROXIMATELY $4.5 MILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPMENT OF TIGER. AMORTIZATION OF THIS ASSET WILL BEGIN WHEN TIGER BEGINS SHIPPING AND WILL BE

RECOGNIZED STRAIGHT-LINE OVER A 3 YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.

DURING

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FILEMAKER PRO 7 SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS EVIDENCED BY PUBLIC

DEMONSTRATION AND RELEASE OF A DEVELOPER BETA VERSION, AND PRIOR TO THE RELEASE OF THE FINAL VERSION OF THE PRODUCT IN MARCH 2004. THEREFORE, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY

CAPITALIZED APPROXIMATELY $2.3 MILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF FILEMAKER PRO 7. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 86, AMORTIZATION OF THIS ASSET BEGAN IN MARCH 2004

WHEN FILEMAKER PRO 7 WAS SHIPPED AND IS BEING RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A 3 YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.

DURING

THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2003, THE COMPANY INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X VERSION 10.3 (CODE-NAMED "PANTHER"), SUBSEQUENT

TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS EVIDENCED BY PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION AND RELEASE OF A DEVELOPER BETA IN JUNE 2003, AND PRIOR TO RELEASE OF THE FINAL VERSION OF THE PRODUCT IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2004. THEREFORE, DURING 2003 THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED APPROXIMATELY $14.7 MILLION OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF PANTHER. AMORTIZATION OF THIS ASSET

BEGAN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004 WHEN PANTHER WAS SHIPPED AND IS BEING RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 86 OVER A 3 YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIFE.

DURING

THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2002, THE COMPANY INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X VERSION 10.2 (CODE-NAMED "JAGUAR") SUBSEQUENT

TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS EVIDENCED BY PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION AND RELEASE OF A DEVELOPER BETA IN MAY 2002, AND PRIOR TO RELEASE OF THE FINAL VERSION OF THE PRODUCT IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED APPROXIMATELY $13.3 MILLION OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPMENT OF JAGUAR. AMORTIZATION OF THIS ASSET BEGAN IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2002 WHEN JAGUAR WAS

AND IS BEING RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 86 OVER A 3 YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. IN ADDITION, DURING 2002, THE COMPANY ALSO BEGAN

CAPITALIZING CERTAIN COSTS RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT OF ITS NEW POWERSCHOOL ENTERPRISE STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM. CAPITALIZATION OF APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION BEGAN UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. THE FINAL VERSION OF THE ENTERPRISE STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM WAS RELEASED IN JULY 2002.

TOTAL

AMORTIZATION RELATED TO CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS WAS $10.7 MILLION, $5.8 MILLION, AND $1.2 MILLION IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

ADVERTISING COSTS

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $206 MILLION, $193 MILLION, AND $209 MILLION FOR 2004, 2003, AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

IN JUNE 2002, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 146,

ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

. SFAS

NO. 146 SUPERSEDES EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUE NO. 94-3,

LIABILITY RECOGNITION FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER COSTS

TO EXIT AN ACTIVITY (INCLUDING CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A RESTRUCTURING)

AND REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR A COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITY BE

RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED, AS OPPOSED TO WHEN MANAGEMENT COMMITS TO AN EXIT PLAN. SFAS NO. 146 ALSO ESTABLISHES THAT THE LIABILITY SHOULD INITIALLY BE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUE. THIS STATEMENT WAS EFFECTIVE FOR EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES INITIATED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 146 WERE REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY AFTER

THE ADOPTION DATE TO NEWLY INITIATED EXIT ACTIVITIES.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY MEASURES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD PRESCRIBED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB)

OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES.

THE COMPANY APPLIES THE DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION

, AS AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 148

, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATIONTRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE

AS IF THE FAIR VALUE-BASED METHOD HAD BEEN APPLIED IN MEASURING COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO FOLLOW APB

OPINION NO. 25 BECAUSE, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, THE ALTERNATIVE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING PROVIDED FOR UNDER SFAS NO. 123 REQUIRES USE OF OPTION VALUATION MODELS THAT WERE NOT DEVELOPED FOR USE

IN VALUING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN SHARES. UNDER APB OPINION NO. 25, WHEN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS EQUALS THE MARKET PRICE OF

THE UNDERLYING STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED.

AS

REQUIRED UNDER SFAS NO. 123, THE PRO FORMA EFFECTS OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

SHARE PURCHASES HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY, USING A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. FOR PURPOSES OF PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES, THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTIONS AND SHARES IS AMORTIZED TO PRO FORMA NET INCOME (LOSS) OVER THE OPTIONS' VESTING PERIOD AND THE SHARES' PLAN PERIOD.

THE

BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL WAS DEVELOPED FOR USE IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF FREELY TRADED OPTIONS THAT HAVE NO VESTING RESTRICTIONS AND ARE FULLY TRANSFERABLE. IN ADDITION, OPTION

VALUATION MODELS REQUIRE THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THE EXPECTED LIFE OF OPTIONS AND THE COMPANY'S EXPECTED STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE

70

STOCK

PURCHASE PLAN SHARES HAVE CHARACTERISTICS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF FREELY TRADED OPTIONS, AND BECAUSE CHANGES IN THE SUBJECTIVE INPUT ASSUMPTIONS CAN MATERIALLY AFFECT THE FAIR

VALUE ESTIMATE, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, THE EXISTING MODELS DO NOT PROVIDE A RELIABLE MEASURE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN SHARES.

FOR

PURPOSES OF PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTIONS AND SHARES IS AMORTIZED TO PRO FORMA NET INCOME (LOSS) OVER THE OPTIONS' VESTING PERIOD AND THE SHARES' PLAN PERIOD. THE

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE

PERIOD. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD

INCREASED TO INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IF THE DILUTIVE POTENTIAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HAD BEEN ISSUED. THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF

OUTSTANDING OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IS REFLECTED IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPLICATION OF THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. UNDER THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD, AN INCREASE IN

THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK CAN RESULT IN A GREATER DILUTIVE EFFECT FROM OUTSTANDING OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. ADDITIONALLY, THE EXERCISE OF

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND THE VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS CAN RESULT IN A GREATER DILUTIVE EFFECT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS, NET INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME REFERS TO REVENUE, EXPENSES, GAINS AND LOSSES THAT UNDER

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ARE RECORDED AS AN ELEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY BUT ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET INCOME. THE COMPANY'S OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS COMPRISED OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES NOT USING THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES CATEGORIZED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, AND NET DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES ON CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

THE COMPANY REPORTS SEGMENT INFORMATION BASED ON THE "MANAGEMENT" APPROACH. THE MANAGEMENT APPROACH DESIGNATES THE INTERNAL REPORTING USED BY MANAGEMENT FOR MAKING DECISIONS

PRIMARILY RELATED TO INVESTMENTS WITH STATED MATURITIES GREATER THAN 1 YEAR, AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003. THE COMPANY OCCASIONALLY SELLS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO THEIR

STATED MATURITIES. AS A RESULT OF SUCH SALES, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET GAINS BEFORE TAXES OF $1 MILLION IN 2004, $21 MILLION IN 2003 AND $7 MILLION IN 2002. THESE NET GAINS WERE

INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET.

VALUES WERE DETERMINED FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SECURITY IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE DECLINES IN VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES AND ARE CONSIDERED

TO BE TEMPORARY IN NATURE. INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. WHEN EVALUATING THE INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY REVIEWS FACTORS SUCH AS THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO

WHICH FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW COST BASIS, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE INVESTEE, AND THE COMPANY'S ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A PERIOD OF TIME WHICH MAY BE SUFFICIENT FOR

ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATION, CONSUMER, AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE

COLLATERAL FROM ITS CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER, WHEN POSSIBLE THE COMPANY DOES ATTEMPT TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK ON TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CREDIT INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN LATIN AMERICA, EUROPE AND ASIA

AND BY ARRANGING WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES TO PROVIDE FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER LOAN AND LEASE PROGRAMS TO THE COMPANY'S DIRECT CUSTOMERS. THESE CREDIT FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE

DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANY AND THE END CUSTOMER. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RECOURSE OR CREDIT RISK SHARING RELATED TO ANY OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS.

HOWEVER, CONSIDERABLE TRADE

RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL, THIRD-PARTY FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS, OR CREDIT INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS. NO CUSTOMER

ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF TRADE RECEIVABLES AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004. TRADE RECEIVABLES FROM A SINGLE CUSTOMER, INGRAM MICRO, INC., ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10.3% OF NET ACCOUNTS

VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY HAS NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF ITS MANUFACTURING VENDORS RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS TO THESE MANUFACTURING VENDORS

WHO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY PURCHASES THESE RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS DIRECTLY FROM SUPPLIERS. THESE NON-TRADE

RECEIVABLES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, TOTALED $276 MILLION AND $184 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004 AND SEPTEMBER 27,

2003, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY PROFITS ON THESE SALES OR REFLECT THE SALE OF THESE COMPONENTS IN ITS NET SALES.

INVENTORY PREPAYMENT

IN APRIL 2002, THE COMPANY MADE A $100 MILLION PREPAYMENT TO AN ASIAN SUPPLIER FOR THE PURCHASE OF COMPONENTS OVER THE FOLLOWING NINE MONTHS. IN RETURN FOR THIS

DEPOSIT, THE SUPPLIER AGREED TO SUPPLY THE COMPANY WITH A SPECIFIED LEVEL OF COMPONENTS DURING THE THREE CONSECUTIVE FISCAL QUARTERS ENDED DECEMBER 28, 2002. DURING THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF

2003, THE REMAINING $53 MILLION OF THE DEPOSIT BALANCE WAS FULLY UTILIZED FOR THE PURCHASE OF COMPONENTS. THE DEPOSIT WAS UNSECURED AND HAD NO STATED INTEREST COMPONENT. THE COMPANY IMPUTED AN

AMOUNT TO COST OF SALES AND INTEREST INCOME DURING EACH PERIOD THE DEPOSIT WAS OUTSTANDING AT A 3.25% INTEREST RATE TO REFLECT THE ECONOMICS OF THIS TRANSACTION.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES TO PARTIALLY OFFSET ITS BUSINESS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE USED TO

OFFSET THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ON CERTAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND TO HEDGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON CERTAIN FORECASTED REVENUE AND COST OF SALES. FROM

TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS TO MODIFY THE INTEREST RATE PROFILE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND DEBT. THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS

ARE BASED ON WHETHER THE INSTRUMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGE OR NON-HEDGE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS ALL DERIVATIVES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE.

FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL, NET FAIR VALUE, AND CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2003

THE

NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE ONE MEASURE OF THE TRANSACTION VOLUME OUTSTANDING AS OF YEAR-END, AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY'S

EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR MARKET LOSS. THE CREDIT RISK AMOUNT SHOWN IN THE TABLE ABOVE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S GROSS EXPOSURE TO

75

POTENTIAL

ACCOUNTING LOSS ON THESE TRANSACTIONS IF ALL COUNTERPARTIES FAILED TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, BASED ON THEN-CURRENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AT EACH

RESPECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS AND MARKET RISK WILL VARY OVER TIME AS A FUNCTION OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE

ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE BASED ON APPLICABLE AND COMMONLY USED PRICING MODELS USING PREVAILING FINANCIAL MARKET INFORMATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2003. IN

CERTAIN INSTANCES WHERE JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE, PRICE QUOTES WERE OBTAINED FROM SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S COUNTERPARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE TABLE ABOVE REFLECTS

THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL, FAIR VALUE, AND CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS, IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT

THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE. THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TOGETHER WITH THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES,

WILL DEPEND ON ACTUAL MARKET CONDITIONS DURING THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENTS.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS AND FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY'S PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY OF ITS EXISTING MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION

EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY NOT HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES DUE TO IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES, OR LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF

APPROPRIATE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

TO

PROTECT GROSS MARGINS FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, THE COMPANY'S U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL SUBSIDIARIES HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES, AND THE

COMPANY'S NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL SUBSIDIARIES SELLING IN LOCAL CURRENCIES HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INVENTORY PURCHASES NOT DENOMINATED IN THE SUBSIDIARIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES IS RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED SALES ARE RECOGNIZED, AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME RELATED TO INVENTORY PURCHASES IS RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF COST OF SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED. TYPICALLY, THE COMPANY HEDGES PORTIONS OF ITS FORECASTED

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUES AND INVENTORY PURCHASES OVER A TIME HORIZON OF 3 TO 9 MONTHS.

DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE DEDESIGNATED AS HEDGES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED TIME PERIOD

OR WITHIN A SUBSEQUENT 2 MONTH TIME PERIOD. DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE IMMEDIATELY RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN

OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO REFLECTED IN CURRENT EARNINGS UNLESS THEY ARE REDESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF OTHER TRANSACTIONS.

DURING 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED NET LOSSES OF $2.8 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE RELATED TO THE LOSS OF HEDGE DESIGNATION ON DISCONTINUED CASH FLOW HEDGES DUE TO CHANGES IN THE

COMPANY'S FORECAST OF FUTURE NET SALES AND COST OF SALES AND DUE TO PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS. NO NET GAINS, OR LOSSES, OF A SIMILAR NATURE WERE RECORDED IN 2003. DURING 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED

NET GAINS OF $2.5 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE RELATED TO THE LOSS OF HEDGE DESIGNATION ON DISCONTINUED CASH FLOW HEDGES DUE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S FORECAST OF FUTURE NET SALES AND

COST OF SALES AND DUE TO PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD A NET DEFERRED LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH CASH FLOW HEDGES OF APPROXIMATELY $4.4 MILLION, NET

OF TAXES, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS BY THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005.

76

THE

COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE TRANSLATION AND ECONOMIC EXPOSURE OF A NET INVESTMENT POSITION IN A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE REMEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN RECORDED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN NON-FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCIES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AS OFFSETS TO THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES. DUE TO MARKET MOVEMENTS, CHANGES IN OPTION TIME VALUE CAN LEAD TO INCREASED VOLATILITY IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY HISTORICALLY ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER MATCH THE COMPANY'S

FLOATING-RATE INTEREST INCOME ON ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH ITS FIXED-RATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON ANY OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT,

AND/OR TO

DIVERSIFY A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE AWAY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN SHORT-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES.

IN

PRIOR YEARS, THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE DEBT SWAPS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER MATCH THE COMPANY'S FLOATING-RATE INTEREST INCOME ON CASH EQUIVALENTS

AND SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS WITH ITS FIXED RATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON ITS LONG TERM DEBT, AND/OR TO DIVERSIFY A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE AWAY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN SHORT TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES.

THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO PAY A FLOATING INTEREST RATE BASED ON THE THREE- OR SIX-MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AND RECEIVE A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST WITHOUT EXCHANGES OF

THE UNDERLYING NOTIONAL AMOUNTS. THESE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED THE COMPANY'S FIXED-RATE 10-YEAR DEBT TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT. DUE TO PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST

RATES, DURING 2001 AND 2002 THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED OUT INTEREST RATE DEBT SWAP POSITIONS REALIZING GAINS OF $23 MILLION WHICH WERE DEFERRED OVER THE REMAINING

LIFE OF THE DEBT.

AS

OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING.

DEBT

IN FEBRUARY 2004, THE COMPANY RETIRED $300 MILLION OF DEBT OUTSTANDING IN THE FORM OF 6.5% UNSECURED NOTES. THE NOTES WERE ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN 1994 AND WERE SOLD

AT 99.9925% OF PAR FOR AN EFFECTIVE YIELD TO MATURITY OF 6.51%. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE NOTES, INCLUDING UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH CLOSED DEBT

INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WAS $304 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE FAIR VALUE WAS $302 MILLION. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTES WAS BASED ON THEIR LISTED MARKET VALUES AS OF SEPTEMBER 27,

2003.

NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES

THE COMPANY HAS HELD SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ARM HOLDINGS PLC (ARM), AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (AKAMAI) AND EARTHLINK NETWORK, INC. (EARTHLINK). THESE

INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS LONG TERM ASSETS WITHIN OTHER ASSETS AND HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE REQUIRING THAT THEY

BE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED IN EQUITY AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ALL REALIZED GAINS ON THE SALE OF THESE

INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. IN FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY SOLD ALL OF ITS REMAINING NON-CURRENT INVESTMENTS IN PUBLIC COMPANIES.

77

EARTHLINK

IN JANUARY 2000, THE COMPANY INVESTED $200 MILLION IN EARTHLINK, AN INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDER (ISP). THE INVESTMENT WAS IN EARTHLINK'S SERIES C CONVERTIBLE

PREFERRED STOCK, WHICH WAS CONVERTIBLE BY THE COMPANY AFTER JANUARY 4, 2001, INTO APPROXIMATELY 7.1 MILLION SHARES OF EARTHLINK COMMON STOCK. CONCURRENT WITH THIS INVESTMENT, EARTHLINK

AND THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A MULTI-YEAR AGREEMENT TO DELIVER ISP SERVICE TO MACINTOSH USERS IN THE U.S. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY PROFITS FROM EACH NEW MACINTOSH

CUSTOMER THAT SUBSCRIBES TO EARTHLINK'S ISP SERVICE FOR A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME, AND EARTHLINK IS THE DEFAULT ISP IN THE COMPANY'S INTERNET SETUP SOFTWARE INCLUDED WITH ALL MACINTOSH COMPUTERS SOLD

IN THE U.S.

DURING

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY SOLD 2,580,000 SHARES OF EARTHLINK STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $13.7 MILLION, AN AMOUNT THAT APPROXIMATED THE COMPANY'S CARRYING VALUE

OF THE SHARES. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY SOLD ALL OF ITS REMAINING HOLDINGS IN EARTHLINK, CONSISTING OF 3,960,000 SHARES OF STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY

$23 MILLION, AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $2 MILLION.

DURING

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY SOLD 117,000 SHARES OF EARTHLINK STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $2 MILLION AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $223,000. NO SALES OF EARTHLINK WERE MADE IN ANY

OF THE SUBSEQUENT QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2002. HOWEVER, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT THE THEN CURRENT DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN EARTHLINK WAS

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A $44 MILLION CHARGE TO EARNINGS TO WRITE-DOWN THE BASIS OF ITS INVESTMENT IN EARTHLINK TO

$35 MILLION. THIS CHARGE WAS INCLUDED IN GAINS (LOSSES) ON NON-CURRENT INVESTMENTS, NET. AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE COMPANY HELD 6.5 MILLION SHARES OF EARTHLINK

STOCK VALUED AT $35 MILLION.

AKAMAI

THE

AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATED TO IPR&D WAS EXPENSED UPON ACQUISITION, BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE

FUTURE USES EXISTED. THE IPR&D RELATES PRIMARILY TO EMAGIC'S LOGIC SERIES TECHNOLOGY AND EXTENSIONS. AT THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION, THE PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT WERE BETWEEN 43%-83%

COMPLETE, AND IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE REMAINING WORK WOULD BE COMPLETED DURING THE COMPANY'S FISCAL 2003 AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $415,000. THE REMAINING EFFORTS, WHICH WERE COMPLETED IN 2003,

INCLUDED FINALIZING USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT, AND TESTING. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D WAS DETERMINED USING AN INCOME APPROACH, WHICH REFLECTS THE PROJECTED FREE CASH FLOWS THAT WILL BE

GENERATED BY THE IPR&D PROJECTS AND THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY, AND DISCOUNTING THE PROJECTED NET CASH FLOWS BACK TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE USING A DISCOUNT RATE OF 25%.

ACQUISITION OF CERTAIN ASSETS OF ZAYANTE, INC., PRISMO GRAPHICS, AND SILICON GRAIL

CONSIDERATION WHICH WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER THE FOLLOWING 3 YEARS, HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY AND WOULD BE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS

OVER 3 YEARS, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM ZAYANTE ASSOCIATED WITH PATENT ROYALTY STREAMS THAT WOULD BE AMORTIZED OVER 10 YEARS.

ACQUISITION OF NOTHING REAL, LLC

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED CERTAIN ASSETS OF NOTHING REAL, LLC (NOTHING REAL), A PRIVATELY-HELD COMPANY THAT DEVELOPS AND MARKETS HIGH

PERFORMANCE TOOLS DESIGNED FOR THE DIGITAL IMAGE CREATION MARKET. OF THE $15 MILLION PURCHASE PRICE, THE COMPANY HAS ALLOCATED $7 MILLION TO ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY, WHICH WILL BE AMORTIZED

OVER ITS ESTIMATED LIFE OF 5 YEARS. THE REMAINING $8 MILLION, WHICH HAS BEEN IDENTIFIED AS CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, RATHER THAN RECORDED AS AN ADDITIONAL COMPONENT OF

82

THE

COST OF THE ACQUIRED ASSETS, WOULD BE ALLOCATED TO FUTURE COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN THE APPROPRIATE PERIODS OVER THE FOLLOWING 3 YEARS.

THE

FOREIGN PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON FOREIGN PRETAX EARNINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $384 MILLION, $250 MILLION AND $284 MILLION IN 2004, 2003, AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. AS

OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, APPROXIMATELY $3.2 BILLION OF THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ARE GENERALLY BASED

IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. AMOUNTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXATION ON REPATRIATION TO THE U.S. THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FULLY PROVIDE FOR ANY RELATED TAX LIABILITY ON AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE REPATRIATED, ASIDE FROM UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED IN OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF $972 MILLION OF SUCH EARNINGS. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX

LIABILITY THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED IF THESE EARNINGS WERE TO BE DISTRIBUTED.

DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF TAX LOSSES, CREDITS, AND THE FUTURE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS

OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES AND ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED

CARRYFORWARDS WAS ACQUIRED FROM NEXT AND OTHER ACQUISITIONS, THE UTILIZATION OF WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS FEDERAL CREDIT

CARRYFORWARDS AND VARIOUS STATE AND FOREIGN TAX LOSS AND CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, THE TAX EFFECT OF WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY $132 MILLION AND WHICH EXPIRE BETWEEN 2005 AND 2024. THE REMAINING

BENEFITS FROM TAX LOSSES AND CREDITS DO NOT EXPIRE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $30 MILLION WAS RECORDED AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR THE BENEFITS OF TAX

LOSSES THAT MAY NOT BE REALIZED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS ACQUIRED FROM NEXT AND OTHER ACQUISITIONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO

FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.

LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE

PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANY'S TAX AUDITS BE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.

STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN

IN JULY 1999, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PLAN FOR THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE UP TO $500 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK. THIS REPURCHASE PLAN DOES

NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES OR ACQUIRE SHARES OVER ANY SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME.

DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE 1.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN SEPTEMBER OF 2003 AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $16.64 PER

SHARE FOR A TOTAL COST OF $25.5 MILLION. IN AUGUST 2003, THE COMPANY SETTLED THIS AGREEMENT PRIOR TO ITS MATURITY, AT WHICH TIME THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $22.81.

OTHER THAN THIS FORWARD PURCHASE TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENGAGED IN ANY TRANSACTIONS TO REPURCHASE ITS COMMON STOCK SINCE FISCAL 2000. SINCE INCEPTION OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN, THE

COMPANY HAD REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 6.55 MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF $217 MILLION. THE COMPANY WAS AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $283 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK AS

OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004.

PREFERRED STOCK

THE COMPANY HAS 5 MILLION SHARES OF AUTHORIZED PREFERRED STOCK, NONE OF WHICH IS OUTSTANDING. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE COMPANY'S RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION, THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS AUTHORIZED TO DETERMINE OR ALTER THE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES, PRIVILEGES AND RESTRICTIONS OF THE COMPANY'S AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

NOTE 8EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLANS

2003 EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION PLAN

AT THE ANNUAL MEETING OF SHAREHOLDERS HELD ON APRIL 24, 2003, THE SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AN AMENDMENT TO THE 1998 EXECUTIVE OFFICER STOCK PLAN TO CHANGE THE NAME OF THE

"REPRICINGS" OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, INCLUDING 6-MONTHS-PLUS-1-DAY OPTION EXCHANGE PROGRAMS, WITHOUT SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL. BASED ON THE TERMS OF

INDIVIDUAL OPTION GRANTS, OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE 2003 PLAN GENERALLY EXPIRE 7 TO 10 YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE AND GENERALLY BECOME EXERCISABLE OVER A PERIOD OF 4 YEARS, BASED ON

CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT, WITH

90

EITHER

ANNUAL OR QUARTERLY VESTING. THE 2003 PLAN PERMITS THE GRANTING OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, NONSTATUTORY STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, AND STOCK PURCHASE

AFTER THE EXCHANGE OPTIONS ARE CANCELLED. ON APRIL 17, 2003, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE EXCHANGE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY CANCELLED OPTIONS TO PURCHASE 16,569,193 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK. ON

OCTOBER 22, 2003, NEW STOCK OPTIONS TOTALING 6,697,368 SHARES WERE ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES AT AN EXERCISE PRICE OF $22.76 PER SHARE, WHICH IS EQUIVALENT TO THE CLOSING PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK

ON THAT DATE. NO FINANCIAL OR ACCOUNTING IMPACT TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOW WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TRANSACTION.

1997 DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN

IN AUGUST 1997, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS ADOPTED A SHAREHOLDER APPROVED DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN (DSOP) FOR NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY.

INITIAL GRANTS OF 30,000 OPTIONS UNDER THE DSOP VEST IN THREE EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ON EACH OF THE FIRST THROUGH THIRD ANNIVERSARIES OF THE DATE OF GRANT, AND SUBSEQUENT ANNUAL GRANTS OF 10,000 OPTIONS

JR., HAVE ENTERED INTO TRADING PLANS PURSUANT TO RULE 10B5-1(C)(1) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. A TRADING PLAN IS A WRITTEN DOCUMENT THAT

SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD EXERCISABLE OPTIONS TO PURCHASE 57.9 MILLION SHARES OUTSTANDING WITH A WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXERCISE PRICE OF $30.85 PER SHARE.

THE

COMPANY HAD 2.515 MILLION RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS OUTSTANDING AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, WHICH WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE OPTIONS OUTSTANDING BALANCES IN THE PRECEDING TABLES. NONE OF

THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WERE VESTED AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004. THE GRANT OF THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS HAS BEEN DEDUCTED FROM THE SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE COMPANY'S STOCK

OPTION PLANS.

NOTE 9STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE

COMPANY HAS PROVIDED PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES IN NOTE 1 OF THESE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE EFFECT ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE AS IF THE FAIR VALUE METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK COMPENSATION HAD BEEN USED FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION GRANTS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN PURCHASES. THESE PRO FORMA EFFECTS HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND

BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY, USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL.

FOR

PURPOSES OF THE PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES PROVIDED PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 123, THE OPTION AWARDS ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2003 AND THE AWARDS CANCELLED AS PART OF THE EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION

EXCHANGE PROGRAM HAVE BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR USING MODIFICATION ACCOUNTING. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 123, THE GRANT DATE OF THE AWARDS ISSUED IS THE DATE OF ACCEPTANCE OF THE EXCHANGE OFFER BY

PARTICIPATING EMPLOYEES. THE CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S CEO'S OPTIONS AND REPLACEMENT WITH RESTRICTED SHARES IN MARCH 2003 IS ALSO BEING ACCOUNTED FOR USING MODIFICATION

ACCOUNTING FOR PURPOSES OF THE PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES PROVIDED PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 123.

FOR

PURPOSES OF THE PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES PROVIDED PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 123, THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTIONS USED BY THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 HAD BEEN BASED SOLELY ON

THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK OVER THE MOST RECENT PERIOD COMMENSURATE WITH THE ESTIMATED EXPECTED LIFE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK OPTIONS. BEGINNING IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF

2003, THE COMPANY HAS MODIFIED THIS APPROACH TO CONSIDER OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS INCLUDING IMPLIED VOLATILITY IN MARKET TRADED OPTIONS ON THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK AND THE IMPACT OF UNUSUAL

FLUCTUATIONS NOT REASONABLY EXPECTED TO RECUR ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THESE AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS IN DEVELOPING THE

EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION USED TO VALUE FUTURE AWARDS.

BEGINNING

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY SHORTENED ITS ESTIMATE OF THE EXPECTED LIFE OF NEW OPTIONS GRANTED TO ITS EMPLOYEES FROM 4 YEARS TO 3.5 YEARS. THE COMPANY BASES ITS

EXPECTED LIFE ASSUMPTION ON ITS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE STOCK OPTIONS IT GRANTS TO EMPLOYEES. THE CHANGE IN THE EXPECTED LIFE ASSUMPTION MADE DURING THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2003 WAS THE RESULT OF THE EXPECTED IMPACT OF SHORTENING THE CONTRACTUAL LIFE OF NEW OPTIONS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES FROM 10 YEARS TO 7 YEARS AND CHANGING THE VESTING PROVISIONS

OF NEW OPTIONS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES FROM 4 YEAR STRAIGHT-LINE ANNUAL VESTING TO 4 YEAR STRAIGHT-LINE QUARTERLY VESTING.

NOTE 10COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

LEASE COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY LEASES VARIOUS EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES, INCLUDING RETAIL SPACE, UNDER NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY UTILIZE ANY OTHER

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE MAJOR FACILITY LEASES ARE FOR TERMS OF 5 TO 10 YEARS AND GENERALLY PROVIDE RENEWAL OPTIONS FOR TERMS OF 3 TO 5 ADDITIONAL YEARS. LEASES

FOR RETAIL SPACE ARE FOR TERMS OF 5 TO 16 YEARS AND OFTEN CONTAIN MULTI-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, THE COMPANY'S TOTAL FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS

UNDER NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES WERE $617 MILLION, OF WHICH $436 MILLION RELATED TO LEASES FOR RETAIL SPACE.

RENT

EXPENSE UNDER ALL OPERATING LEASES, INCLUDING BOTH CANCELABLE AND NONCANCELABLE LEASES, WAS $103 MILLION, $97 MILLION, AND $92 MILLION IN 2004, 2003, AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

ACCRUED WARRANTY AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY OFFERS A BASIC LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY ON ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE BASIC WARRANTY PERIOD FOR HARDWARE PRODUCTS IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF

PURCHASE BY THE END-USER. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A 90-DAY BASIC WARRANTY FOR APPLE SERVICE PARTS USED TO REPAIR APPLE HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY PROVIDES CURRENTLY FOR THE

ESTIMATED COST THAT MAY BE INCURRED UNDER ITS BASIC LIMITED PRODUCT WARRANTIES AT THE TIME RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING APPROPRIATE ACCRUALS FOR PRODUCT WARRANTY

OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED

COST-PER-CLAIM, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY'S TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PREEXISTING WARRANTY

LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN FUTURE EXPECTATIONS.

THE

COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM

AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST ITSELF OR AN

INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY AND, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO UNRESOLVED INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT COSTS AS OF EITHER SEPTEMBER 25, 2004 OR

SEPTEMBER 27, 2003.

CONCENTRATIONS IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCT

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, OTHER KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND

APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, OR ("ASICS")) ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME OTHER KEY COMPONENTS, WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM

MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER INDUSTRY, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR AND

SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT TO THE COMPANY WERE TO BE DELAYED OR CURTAILED OR IN THE EVENT A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYS SHIPMENTS

OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SHIP RELATED PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN

ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO

MEET THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. FINALLY, SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE COMPANY'S CPUS, LOGIC BOARDS, AND ASSEMBLED PRODUCTS ARE NOW MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH OCCURS IN

VARIOUS PARTS OF ASIA. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WORKS CLOSELY WITH ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ON MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES, THE COMPANY'S OPERATING

RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS WERE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION OBLIGATIONS.

CONTINGENCIES

BEGINNING ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2001, THREE SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AGAINST THE

COMPANY AND ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. THESE LAWSUITS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL, AND PURPORT TO BRING SUIT ON BEHALF OF PERSONS WHO PURCHASED THE COMPANY'S PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON STOCK BETWEEN

JULY 19, 2000, AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2000. THE COMPLAINTS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF THE 1934 SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT AND SEEK UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND OTHER RELIEF. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THESE CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THEM VIGOROUSLY. THE COMPANY FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS ON JUNE 4, 2002, WHICH WAS HEARD BY THE COURT ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2002.

ON DECEMBER 11, 2002, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANY'S MOTION TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION, WITH LEAVE TO PLAINTIFFS TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS. PLAINTIFFS

FILED THEIR AMENDED COMPLAINT ON JANUARY 31, 2003, AND ON MARCH 17, 2003, THE COMPANY FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT. THE COURT HEARD THE COMPANY'S MOTION ON

JULY 11, 2003 AND DISMISSED PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS WITH PREJUDICE ON AUGUST 12, 2003. PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED THE RULING.

THE

COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY ADJUDICATED. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY

DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY

OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE

LEGAL MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PRODUCTION

AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS

96

THE

ABILITY TO RETURN PRODUCT AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN

PASSED IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES INCLUDING VARIOUS EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER COUNTRIES, JAPAN AND CERTAIN STATES WITHIN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

NOTE 11SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 131,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION

, THE COMPANY REPORTS SEGMENT INFORMATION

BASED ON THE "MANAGEMENT" APPROACH. THE MANAGEMENT APPROACH DESIGNATES THE INTERNAL REPORTING USED BY MANAGEMENT FOR MAKING DECISIONS AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE AS THE SOURCE OF THE COMPANY'S

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.

THE

COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE COMPRISED OF THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND RETAIL. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCLUDES

BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA, EXCEPT FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT. THE EUROPE SEGMENT INCLUDES EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. THE JAPAN SEGMENT

INCLUDES ONLY JAPAN AND EXCLUDES REVENUE FROM THE COMPANY'S OWN RETAIL STORES IN JAPAN, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT. THE RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATED APPLE-OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE

U.S. AND JAPAN DURING FISCAL 2004. OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS INCLUDE ASIA-PACIFIC, WHICH INCLUDES AUSTRALIA AND ASIA EXCEPT FOR JAPAN, AND THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARY, FILEMAKER, INC.

EACH REPORTABLE GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT PROVIDES SIMILAR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SIMILAR SERVICES, AND THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE VARIOUS SEGMENTS ARE THE SAME AS THOSE DESCRIBED

IN NOTE 1, "SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES," EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED BELOW FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT.

THE

COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON NET SALES. THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S PERFORMANCE IS ALSO EVALUATED BASED ON OPERATING INCOME. NET SALES FOR GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS ARE

GENERALLY BASED ON THE LOCATION OF THE CUSTOMERS. OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT INCLUDES NET SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, RELATED COST OF SALES, AND OPERATING EXPENSES DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

SEGMENT. OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT EXCLUDES OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AND CERTAIN EXPENSES THAT ARE MANAGED OUTSIDE THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. COSTS EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE

VARIOUS CORPORATE EXPENSES, MANUFACTURING COSTS NOT INCLUDED IN STANDARD COSTS, INCOME TAXES, AND VARIOUS NONRECURRING CHARGES. CORPORATE EXPENSES INCLUDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CORPORATE MARKETING

EXPENSES, AND OTHER SEPARATELY MANAGED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDING CERTAIN CORPORATE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPORT OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT. THE COMPANY DOES NOT INCLUDE INTERCOMPANY

TRANSFERS BETWEEN SEGMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES. SEGMENT ASSETS EXCLUDE CORPORATE ASSETS. CORPORATE ASSETS INCLUDE CASH, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS,

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, MISCELLANEOUS CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE, GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND RETAIL STORE CONSTRUCTION-IN-PROGRESS THAT IS NOT SUBJECT

TO DEPRECIATION. EXCEPT FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE NOT REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT BY SEGMENT. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT WERE

$104 MILLION, $92 MILLION AND $106 MILLION FOR 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

OPERATING

INCOME FOR ALL SEGMENTS, EXCEPT RETAIL, INCLUDES COST OF SALES AT MANUFACTURING STANDARD COST, OTHER COST OF SALES, RELATED SALES AND MARKETING COSTS, AND CERTAIN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

COSTS. THIS MEASURE OF OPERATING INCOME, WHICH INCLUDES MANUFACTURING PROFIT, PROVIDES A COMPARABLE BASIS FOR COMPARISON BETWEEN THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS. CERTAIN MANUFACTURING

EXPENSES AND

97

RELATED

ADJUSTMENTS NOT INCLUDED IN SEGMENT COST OF SALES, INCLUDING VARIANCES BETWEEN STANDARD AND ACTUAL MANUFACTURING COSTS AND THE MARK-UP ABOVE STANDARD COST FOR PRODUCT SUPPLIED TO

THE RETAIL SEGMENT, ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE EXPENSES.

MANAGEMENT

ASSESSES THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT DIFFERENTLY THAN IT ASSESSES THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY'S GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS. THE RETAIL SEGMENT REVENUE AND

OPERATING INCOME IS INTENDED TO DEPICT A COMPARABLE MEASURE TO THAT OF THE COMPANY'S MAJOR CHANNEL PARTNERS IN THE U.S. OPERATING RETAIL STORES SO THE COMPANY CAN EVALUATE THE RETAIL SEGMENT

PERFORMANCE AS IF IT WERE A CHANNEL PARTNER. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY MAKES THREE SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS OF

THE COMPANY'S OTHER SEGMENTS.

FIRST,

THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES COST OF SALES FOR APPLE PRODUCTS AT AN AMOUNT NORMALLY CHARGED TO MAJOR CHANNEL PARTNERS IN THE U.S. OPERATING RETAIL STORES, LESS THE COST OF

SALES PROGRAMS AND INCENTIVES PROVIDED TO THOSE CHANNEL PARTNERS AND THE COMPANY'S COST TO SUPPORT THOSE PARTNERS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, AND

SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THIS RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF ADDITIONAL COST OF SALES ABOVE STANDARD COST BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT AND AN OFFSETTING BENEFIT TO CORPORATE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY

$213 MILLION, $106 MILLION, AND $52 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

SECOND,

THE COMPANY'S EXTENDED WARRANTY, SUPPORT AND SERVICE CONTRACTS ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT AT THE SAME COST AS THAT CHARGED TO THE COMPANY'S MAJOR RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS IN THE

U.S., RESULTING IN A COMPARABLE MEASURE OF REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN BETWEEN THE COMPANY'S RETAIL STORES AND THOSE RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS. THE RETAIL SEGMENT RECOGNIZES THE FULL AMOUNT OF REVENUE AND

COST OF SALES AT THE TIME OF SALE OF THE COMPANY'S EXTENDED WARRANTY, SUPPORT AND SERVICE CONTRACTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET EARNED THE REVENUE OR INCURRED THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE

OF THESE CONTRACTS, AN OFFSET TO THESE AMOUNTS IS RECOGNIZED IN OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS' NET SALES AND COST OF SALES. FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, THIS RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF

NET SALES AND COST OF SALES BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT, WITH CORRESPONDING OFFSETS IN OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS, OF $54 MILLION AND $37 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE YEAR ENDED

SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THE NET SALES AND COST OF SALES RECOGNIZED BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT FOR SALES OF EXTENDED WARRANTY, SUPPORT AND SERVICE CONTRACTS WERE $30 MILLION AND

$20 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THIS RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF NET SALES AND COST OF SALES BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT OF $8 MILLION AND

$6 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THIRD,

THE COMPANY HAS OPENED SIX HIGH PROFILE STORES IN NEW YORK, LOS ANGELES, CHICAGO, SAN FRANCISCO, TOKYO, JAPAN AND OSAKA, JAPAN AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004 AND HAS AN ADDITIONAL STORE UNDER

DEVELOPMENT IN LONDON, ENGLAND, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OPEN BY THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR 2004. THESE HIGH PROFILE STORES ARE LARGER THAN THE COMPANY'S TYPICAL RETAIL STORES AND WERE DESIGNED TO FURTHER

PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND PROVIDE A VENUE FOR CERTAIN CORPORATE SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING CORPORATE BRIEFINGS. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED

WITH THESE STORES TO CORPORATE MARKETING EXPENSE TO REFLECT THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT REALIZED COMPANY-WIDE. THE ALLOCATION OF THESE OPERATING COSTS IS BASED ON THE EXCESS AMOUNT INCURRED FOR

A HIGH PROFILE STORE TO THAT OF A MORE TYPICAL COMPANY RETAIL LOCATION. EXPENSES ALLOCATED TO CORPORATE MARKETING RESULTING FROM THE OPERATIONS OF THESE STORES WERE $16 MILLION,

$6 MILLION AND $1 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2002 RESPECTIVELY.

ON EACH SUBSEQUENT ANNIVERSARY THEREAFTER, THE DIRECTOR WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AN OPTION TO ACQUIRE 10,000 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK ("

ANNUAL

OPTIONS"

). ANNUAL OPTIONS ARE FULLY VESTED AND IMMEDIATELY EXERCISABLE ON THEIR DATE OF GRANT. AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR, THERE WERE OPTIONS FOR 440,000 SHARES

OUTSTANDING

UNDER THE DIRECTOR PLAN. SINCE ACCEPTING THE POSITION OF CEO, MR. JOBS IS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR GRANTS UNDER THE DIRECTOR PLAN. NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS ALSO RECEIVE A $50,000 ANNUAL

RETAINER PAID IN QUARTERLY INCREMENTS. IN ADDITION, DIRECTORS RECEIVE UP TO TWO FREE COMPUTER SYSTEMS PER YEAR AND ARE ELIGIBLE TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AT A DISCOUNT. DIRECTORS DO NOT RECEIVE
