MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION

THE COMPANYS CUSTOMERS

ARE PRIMARILY IN THE EDUCATION, CREATIVE, CONSUMER, AND BUSINESS MARKETS. THE

COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND

REGIONAL RETAILERS AND

12

CATALOGUERS. NO INDIVIDUAL

CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF NET SALES IN 2005, 2004, OR 2003. THE

COMPANY ALSO SELLS MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND RESELLS CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY

PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS, EDUCATION

CUSTOMERS, AND BUSINESSES THROUGH ITS RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES IN THE U.S. AND

INTERNATIONALLY. OVER 12% OF THE COMPANYS NET SALES IN 2005 WERE THROUGH ITS

U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL, INCLUDING SALES TO ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS,

HIGHER EDUCATION INSTITUTIONS, AND INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS.

COMPETITION

THE COMPANY IS CONFRONTED BY AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION IN

ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED

SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THIS MARKET CONTINUES

TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN BOTH HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED THE CAPABILITIES AND USE OF PERSONAL

COMPUTERS AND HAVE RESULTED IN THE FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS WITH

COMPETITIVE PRICE, FEATURE, AND PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS. OVER THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS, PRICE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAS BEEN

PARTICULARLY INTENSE. THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS WHO SELL PERSONAL COMPUTERS

BASED ON OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED THEIR

PRODUCT MARGINS TO GAIN OR MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE. THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE AND OTHER

INDUSTRY-WIDE DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON GROSS MARGINS.

THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE MARKET FOR

PERSONAL COMPUTERS INCLUDE PRICE, RELATIVE PRICE/PERFORMANCE, PRODUCT QUALITY

AND RELIABILITY, DESIGN INNOVATION, AVAILABILITY OF SOFTWARE, PRODUCT FEATURES,

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITY, SERVICE AND SUPPORT, AVAILABILITY OF

HARDWARE PERIPHERALS, AND CORPORATE REPUTATION. FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS PLACE MORE RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET, AN

INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT ARE SMALLER, SIMPLER, AND LESS

EXPENSIVE THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH

THE COMPANYS EXISTING PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY TAKING AND WILL CONTINUE TO

TAKE STEPS TO RESPOND TO THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES BEING PLACED ON ITS PERSONAL

COMPUTER SALES AS A RESULT OF INNOVATIONS FROM COMPETING PLATFORMS. THE COMPANYS

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON

ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM IN

ORDER TO MAINTAIN PERCEIVED FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN ADVANTAGES OVER COMPETING

PLATFORMS.

THE COMPANYS SERVICES AND

PRODUCTS RELATING TO MUSIC AND OTHER CREATIVE CONTENT HAVE ALREADY ENCOURAGED

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMPANIES, MANY OF WHOM HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL,

MARKETING, AND MANUFACTURING RESOURCES THAN THOSE OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

FACES INCREASING COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMPANIES PROMOTING THEIR OWN DIGITAL

MUSIC PRODUCTS AND DISTRIBUTION SERVICES, SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, AND FREE

PEER-TO-PEER MUSIC SERVICES. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT COMPETITION WILL

INTENSIFY AS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND CONTENT PROVIDERS WORK MORE

COLLABORATIVELY TO OFFER INTEGRATED PRODUCTS COMPETING WITH THE COMPANYS

OFFERINGS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT CURRENTLY MAINTAINS A COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE BY MORE EFFECTIVELY INTEGRATING AN ENTIRE SOLUTION, INCLUDING THE

HARDWARE (IPOD), SOFTWARE (ITUNES), AND DISTRIBUTION OF THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL

CONTENT (ITUNES MUSIC STORE).

RAW MATERIALS

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS

(INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (ASICS))

ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME

OTHER KEY COMPONENTS, WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM MULTIPLE

SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE AVAILABILITY CONSTRAINTS AND

PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT

COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS

INDUSTRIES, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE

CUSTOM COMPONENTS

13

OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS

EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL

SUPPLIERS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY OR SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT TO THE

COMPANY WERE TO BE DELAYED OR CURTAILED OR IN THE EVENT A KEY MANUFACTURING

VENDOR DELAYS SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO SHIP RELATED PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANY DID EXPERIENCE SUCH DELAYS DURING 2004

AND 2005 RELATED TO POWERPC G5 PROCESSORS, WHICH RESULTED IN THE CONSTRAINED

AVAILABILITY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO

OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND

OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY

OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE

ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET

THE COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS. IN JUNE 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS

INTENTION TO TRANSITION ITS MACINTOSH COMPUTERS USING THE POWERPC G5 AND G4

MICROPROCESSORS, WHICH ARE CURRENTLY SINGLE-SOURCED, TO INTEL MICROPROCESSORS

BY THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR 2007. THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THIS TRANSITION MAY

IMPACT THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OF CERTAIN COMPONENTS AND

SERVICES, INCLUDING POWERPC G5 AND G4 MICROPROCESSORS. THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO

MITIGATE THESE POTENTIAL RISKS BY WORKING CLOSELY WITH THESE AND OTHER KEY

SUPPLIERS ON PRODUCT INTRODUCTION PLANS, STRATEGIC INVENTORIES, COORDINATED PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS, AND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES AND LEVELS.

CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A

COMBINATION OF FORMAL PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS

BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. THE COMPANYS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

TYPICALLY COVER ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS

RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THERE

ARE SEVERAL COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHOSE LOSS TO THE

COMPANY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND

FINANCIAL POSITION. AT THIS TIME, SUCH VENDORS INCLUDE AGERE SYSTEMS, INC.,

AMBIT MICROSYSTEMS CORPORATION, ASUSTEK CORPORATION, ATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.,

BROADCOM CORPORATION, CYPRESS SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION, FREESCALE

SEMICONDUCTOR, INC., HITACHI GLOBAL STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES, HON HAI

PRECISION INDUSTRY CO., LTD., IBM CORPORATION, INTEL CORPORATION, INTERNATIONAL

DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY, INVENTEC APPLIANCES CORPORATION, LG. PHILLIPS CO., LTD.,

MATSUSHITA, MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC CORPORATION, NVIDIA CORP., PORTALPLAYER, INC.,

QUANTA COMPUTER, INC., SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS, SYNAPTICS, INC., AND

TOSHIBA CORPORATION.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

BECAUSE THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID

TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IS

HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY FLOW OF

COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY CONTINUES

TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND TO ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS IN

THE AREAS OF HARDWARE AND PERIPHERALS, CONSUMER ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS, SYSTEM

SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE AND

SOLUTIONS, AND THE INTERNET. THE COMPANY MAY EXPAND THE RANGE OF ITS PRODUCT

OFFERINGS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THROUGH LICENSING AND/OR ACQUISITION OF

CUSTOMERS. A FURTHER DESCRIPTION OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART I,

ITEM 1 OF THIS DOCUMENT UNDER THE HEADING BUSINESS.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS STRATEGY LEVERAGES ITS ABILITY,

THROUGH THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF ITS OWN OPERATING SYSTEM, HARDWARE, AND

MANY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES, TO BRING TO ITS CUSTOMERS AROUND

THE WORLD COMPELLING NEW PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS WITH SUPERIOR EASE-OF-USE,

SEAMLESS INTEGRATION, AND INNOVATIVE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN.

THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN SEVERAL HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

MARKETS, INCLUDING PERSONAL COMPUTERS WITH ITS MACINTOSH LINE OF COMPUTERS,

CONSUMER ELECTRONICS WITH ITS IPOD LINE OF DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS, AND

DISTRIBUTION OF THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT THROUGH ITS ONLINE ITUNES MUSIC

STORE. WHILE THE COMPANY IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS AN INNOVATOR IN THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONIC MARKETS AS WELL AS A LEADER IN THE EMERGING

MARKET FOR DISTRIBUTION OF DIGITAL CONTENT, THESE ARE ALL HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

MARKETS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO AGGRESSIVE PRICING AND INCREASED COMPETITION. TO

REMAIN COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) AND MARKETING AND ADVERTISING IS NECESSARY TO

MAINTAIN AND EXTEND ITS POSITION IN THE MARKETS WHERE IT COMPETES. THE COMPANYS

R&D SPENDING IS FOCUSED ON DELIVERING TIMELY UPDATES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO

ITS EXISTING LINE OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS, DISPLAYS, OPERATING SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS, AND PORTABLE MUSIC PLAYERS; DEVELOPING NEW DIGITAL LIFESTYLE

CONSUMER AND PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS; AND INVESTING IN NEW PRODUCT

AREAS SUCH AS RACK-MOUNT SERVERS, RAID STORAGE SYSTEMS, AND WIRELESS

UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY OCCUR DURING THIS TRANSITION, WHICH ARE FURTHER

DISCUSSED UNDER THE HEADING FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VARIETY OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SALES OF ITS INNOVATIVE AND

DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS ARE ENHANCED BY KNOWLEDGEABLE SALESPERSONS WHO CAN

CONVEY THE VALUE OF THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND PERIPHERAL INTEGRATION,

DEMONSTRATE THE UNIQUE DIGITAL LIFESTYLE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE ONLY ON

MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, AND DEMONSTRATE THE COMPATIBILITY OF THE MACINTOSH WITH

THE WINDOWS PLATFORM AND NETWORKS. THE COMPANY FURTHER BELIEVES THAT PROVIDING

A

27

HIGH-QUALITY SALES AND AFTER-SALES SUPPORT EXPERIENCE

IS CRITICAL TO ATTRACTING AND RETAINING CUSTOMERS. TO ENSURE A HIGH-QUALITY

BUYING EXPERIENCE FOR ITS PRODUCTS IN WHICH SERVICE AND EDUCATION ARE

EMPHASIZED, THE COMPANY HAS EXPANDED AND IMPROVED ITS DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES

BY OPENING ITS OWN RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY. THE COMPANY

HAD 124 STORES OPEN AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005.

THE COMPANY ALSO STAFFS SELECTED THIRD-PARTY STORES

WITH THE COMPANYS OWN EMPLOYEES TO IMPROVE THE BUYING EXPERIENCE THROUGH

PURCHASED IN CERTAIN DEPARTMENT STORES, MEMBER-ONLY WAREHOUSE STORES, LARGE

RETAIL CHAINS, AND SPECIALTY RETAIL STORES, AS WELL AS THROUGH THE CHANNELS

LISTED ABOVE.

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED

DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

AND THE COMPANYS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REQUIRE THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS,

ASSUMPTIONS, AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES THE

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT BELIEVES TO BE

REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR

MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL

RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE

COMPANYS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE RELATED TO

REVENUE RECOGNITION, ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, INVENTORY VALUATION AND

INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, WARRANTY COSTS, AND INCOME TAXES. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THESE POLICIES TO BE CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE

PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY

UNCERTAIN. THE COMPANYS SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED THESE CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE AUDIT AND FINANCE

COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE

OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, PERIPHERALS, DIGITAL CONTENT, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT

CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS, INCLUDING STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) NO. 97-2,

SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION

, AS AMENDED, AND SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 104,

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE

EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS

FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED

DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED, AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS

HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA

ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS,

FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES,

THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE

COMPANY LEGALLY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING

TRANSIT. IF AT THE OUTSET OF AN ARRANGEMENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE

ARRANGEMENT FEE IS NOT, OR IS PRESUMED NOT TO BE, FIXED OR DETERMINABLE,

REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED AS AMOUNTS BECOME DUE AND

PAYABLE.

28

THE COMPANY RECORDS

REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND

FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING RESELLER AND END-USER REBATES, AND

OTHER SALES PROGRAMS AND VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES. THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE

PROGRAMS IS ACCRUED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE IN THE PERIOD THE COMPANY HAS

SOLD THE PRODUCT AND COMMITTED TO THE RELEVANT PROGRAM. THE COMPANY ALSO

RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE

COMPANYS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT

TRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INCREASE CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND

INCUR INCREMENTAL PRICE PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL

REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE AT THE TIME SUCH PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED. ADDITIONALLY,

CERTAIN CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER

OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY REDEEM THE INCENTIVE BASED ON HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PARTICULAR INCENTIVE

PROGRAMS. IF A GREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF CUSTOMERS REDEEM SUCH

INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO

REVENUE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

ALLOWANCE FOR

DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH

THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATION, CONSUMER, AND

COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE COLLATERAL FROM

ITS CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER, WHEN POSSIBLE THE COMPANY DOES ATTEMPT TO LIMIT CREDIT

RISK ON TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CREDIT INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN LATIN

AMERICA, EUROPE, AND ASIA AND BY ARRANGING WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES

TO PROVIDE FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER LOAN AND LEASE PROGRAMS TO THE

COMPANYS DIRECT CUSTOMERS. THESE CREDIT-FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY

BETWEEN THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANY AND THE END CUSTOMER. AS SUCH, THE

COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RECOURSE OR CREDIT RISK SHARING RELATED

TO ANY OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER, CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE

NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL, THIRD-PARTY FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS, OR CREDIT

INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANYS DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL

PARTNERS.

THE

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS IS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT OF

THE COLLECTIBILITY OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AND INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF

THE CREDIT WORTHINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THOSE SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE

THE SPECIFIC RECEIVABLES TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS REASONABLY BELIEVED TO BE

COLLECTIBLE

. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS AN

ALLOWANCE FOR ALL OTHER TRADE RECEIVABLES BASED ON MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING

HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE WITH BAD DEBTS, THE GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF THE COMPANYS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, AND THE AGING OF SUCH

RECEIVABLES.

IF THERE IS A

DETERIORATION OF A MAJOR CUSTOMERS FINANCIAL CONDITION, IF THE COMPANY BECOMES

AWARE OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF A MAJOR

CUSTOMER, OR IF FUTURE ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON TRADE RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL

DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, WHICH WOULD AFFECT EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD THE

ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.

INVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND

BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A

WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY

PRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF

ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED

REVIEW OF INVENTORY EACH FISCAL QUARTER THAT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS

INCLUDING DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. THE PERSONAL COMPUTER

AND CONSUMER ELECTRONIC INDUSTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO A RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE

PACE OF PRODUCT AND COMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE AND DEMAND CHANGES. IF FUTURE DEMAND

OR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN

FORECASTED OR IF UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE UTILITY

OF COMPONENT INVENTORY, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL

WRITE-DOWNS WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE

WRITE-DOWNS ARE RECORDED.

29

THE

COMPANY ACCRUES NECESSARY RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO COMPONENT

ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED.

CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE

COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER

CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. THESE

COMMITMENTS

TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANYS

REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND

SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS OR AN

UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS,

THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL RESERVES FOR

CANCELLATION FEES THAT WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS IN THE PERIOD WHEN

THE CANCELLATION FEES ARE IDENTIFIED.

WARRANTY COSTS

THE COMPANY PROVIDES

CURRENTLY FOR THE ESTIMATED COST FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES,

HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC

PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANYS TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. EACH

QUARTER, THE COMPANY REEVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF ITS

RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF

PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION, AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY.

IF ACTUAL PRODUCT FAILURE RATES OR REPAIR COSTS

DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITY WOULD BE

REQUIRED AND COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY RECORDS A TAX PROVISION FOR THE

ANTICIPATED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

, THE

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD,

UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED

FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND

TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED

USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT

FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR SETTLED.

THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE

AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED. THE COMPANY IS

CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE REPATRIATION PROVISIONS OF THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION

ACT OF 2004, WHICH, IF IMPLEMENTED BY THE COMPANY, WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS

TAX PROVISION AND DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT

FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF

CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE DEFERRED

TAX LIABILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT ALL OR PART OF THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE

DETERMINED NOT TO BE REALIZABLE IN THE FUTURE, AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION

ALLOWANCE WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

SIMILARLY, IF THE COMPANY SUBSEQUENTLY REALIZES DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT WERE

PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED TO BE UNREALIZABLE, THE RESPECTIVE VALUATION ALLOWANCE

WOULD BE REVERSED, RESULTING IN A POSITIVE ADJUSTMENT TO EARNINGS OR A DECREASE

IN GOODWILL IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION

OF TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF

UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAWS. RESOLUTION OF THESE

UNCERTAINTIES IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

POSITION.

FISCAL YEAR 2005 VERSUS 2004

DURING 2005, NET

SALES INCREASED 68% OR $5.7 BILLION FROM 2004. SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED

FAVORABLY TO NET SALES DURING 2005.

·

NET SALES OF

IPODS ROSE $3.2 BILLION OR 248% DURING 2005 COMPARED

TO 2004. UNIT SALES OF IPODS TOTALED 22.5 MILLION IN 2005, WHICH REPRESENTS AN

INCREASE OF 409% FROM THE 4.4 MILLION IPOD UNITS SOLD IN 2004. STRONG SALES OF

IPODS DURING 2005 CONTINUED TO BE EXPERIENCED IN ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING

SEGMENTS AND WAS DRIVEN BY

STRONG DEMAND FOR

THE IPOD SHUFFLE INTRODUCED IN JANUARY 2005, THE RELEASE OF AN UPDATED

VERSION OF THE IPOD MINI IN FEBRUARY 2005, THE RELEASE OF THE IPOD NANO IN

SEPTEMBER 2005, AND EXPANSION OF THE IPODS DISTRIBUTION NETWORK.

NET SALES PER IPOD UNIT SOLD DECREASED 32% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF

THE LOWER PRICED IPOD SHUFFLE IN JANUARY 2005 AND IPOD MINI PRICING

REDUCTIONS IN FEBRUARY 2005. FROM THE INTRODUCTION OF THE IPOD IN 2002

THROUGH 2005, THE COMPANY HAS SOLD APPROXIMATELY 28 MILLION IPODS.

·

OTHER

MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CONSISTS OF SALES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

ITUNES MUSIC STORE AND IPOD SERVICES AND ACCESSORIES. NET SALES OF OTHER MUSIC

RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCREASED $621 MILLION OR 223% DURING 2005

COMPARED TO 2004. THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED STRONG GROWTH IN SALES OF IPOD

SERVICES AND ACCESSORIES CONSISTENT WITH THE INCREASE IN OVERALL IPOD UNIT

SALES FOR 2005. THE INCREASED SALES FROM THE ITUNES MUSIC STORE IS PRIMARILY

DUE TO SUBSTANTIAL GROWTH OF NET SALES IN THE U.S. AND EXPANSION IN EUROPE,

CANADA, AND JAPAN.

·

TOTAL

MACINTOSH NET SALES INCREASED $1.4 BILLION OR 27% DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004.

UNIT SALES OF MACINTOSH SYSTEMS INCREASED 1.2 MILLION UNITS OR 38% DURING 2005

COMPARED TO 2004. THE INCREASES IN MACINTOSH NET SALES AND UNIT SALES RELATE

PRIMARILY TO STRONG DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS DESKTOP PRODUCTS, WHICH WAS

EXPERIENCED IN ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THAT THE SUCCESS OF THE IPOD IS HAVING A POSITIVE IMPACT ON MACINTOSH NET SALES

BY INTRODUCING NEW CUSTOMERS TO THE COMPANYS OTHER PRODUCTS. DESKTOP DEMAND

WAS STIMULATED IN 2005 DUE TO THE NEW IMAC G5 AND THE INTRODUCTION OF THE MAC

MINI IN JANUARY 2005. NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF DESKTOP PRODUCTS

INCREASED 45% AND 55%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. MACINTOSH

NET SALES AND UNIT SALES ALSO INCLUDE SALES OF THE COMPANYS PORTABLE PRODUCTS,

WHICH INCREASED 11% AND 21%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 2004.

NET SALES PER MACINTOSH

UNIT SOLD DECREASED 7% ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS. THE DECREASE WAS THE RESULT

OF CHANGES IN THE OVERALL UNIT MIX TOWARDS RELATIVELY LOWER-PRICED CONSUMER

PRODUCTS, SPECIFICALLY THE IMPACT OF THE MAC MINI PRODUCT, AND DESKTOP AND

PORTABLE PRICE REDUCTIONS. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN

THE PROPORTION OF DIRECT SALES.

·

THE

RETAIL SEGMENTS NET SALES GREW 98% TO $2.4 BILLION DURING 2005 COMPARED TO

2004. THIS INCREASE IS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN TOTAL STORES

FROM 86 AT THE END OF 2004 TO 124 AT THE END OF 2005, AS WELL AS 44%

YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE. WHILE THE COMPANYS

CUSTOMERS IN AREAS WHERE THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAS OPENED STORES MAY ELECT TO PURCHASE

FROM THE RETAIL SEGMENT STORES RATHER THAN THE COMPANYS PREEXISTING SALES

CHANNELS IN THE U.S., CANADA, JAPAN, AND THE U.K., THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENTS NET SALES IS INCREMENTAL TO THE

COMPANYS TOTAL NET SALES. SEE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BELOW RELATED TO THE RETAIL

SEGMENT UNDER THE HEADING SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE.

·

NET

SALES OF PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE ROSE BY 18% DURING 2005 COMPARED TO

2004 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET SALES OF DISPLAYS AND OTHER COMPUTER

ACCESSORIES.

NET SALES

OF OTHER

HARDWARE INCLUDE AIRPORT CARDS AND BASE STATIONS, XSERVE RAID STORAGE, ISIGHT

DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERAS, AND THIRD-PARTY HARDWARE PRODUCTS.

·

THE

COMPANYS U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL EXPERIENCED YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN BOTH NET

SALES AND UNIT SALES OF APPROXIMATELY 21% FOR 2005. THE INCREASE IN U.S.

EDUCATION NET SALES FOR 2005 RELATES

32

PRIMARILY TO A 32%

YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN HIGHER EDUCATION NET SALES DUE TO INCREASED IMAC

SHIPMENTS, PORTABLE SYSTEM SHIPMENTS, AND ONLINE SALES. THE COMPANY ALSO

EXPERIENCED 11% GROWTH IN K-12 NET SALES DUE TO INCREASED IBOOK SALES AND

EDUCATION 1:1 SALES. WHILE NET SALES TO THE K-12 MARKET WERE SLIGHTLY

HIGHER DURING 2005 THAN 2004, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS MARKET CONTINUES TO BE

SUBJECT TO BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES.

·

NET SALES OF SOFTWARE, SERVICE AND OTHER SALES

ROSE $270 MILLION OR 33% DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. THIS GROWTH WAS

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED NET SALES IN APPLECARE PROTECTION PLAN

(APP) EXTENDED SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER

ASSOCIATED MACINTOSH COMPUTER SALES. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED

INCREASES IN NET SALES OF .MAC INTERNET SERVICE, PROFESSIONAL AND CONSUMER

APPLICATIONS, THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE, AND MAC OS X THAT WAS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RELEASE OF VERSION 10.4 TIGER IN APRIL 2005.

FISCAL YEAR 2004 VERSUS 2003

DURING 2004, NET

SALES INCREASED 33% OR $2.1 BILLION FROM 2003. SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED

FAVORABLY TO NET SALES DURING 2004.

·

NET SALES OF MACINTOSH

SYSTEMS INCREASED $432 MILLION OR 10% DURING 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 WHILE NET

SALES PER MACINTOSH UNIT SOLD REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR

BASIS. UNIT SALES OF MACINTOSH SYSTEMS INCREASED 278,000 UNITS OR 9% DURING

2004 COMPARED TO 2003. THESE INCREASES IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES WERE A

RESULT OF STRONG DEMAND FOR ALL OF THE COMPANYS MACINTOSH SYSTEMS, EXCEPT THE

IMAC. THE COMPANYS PORTABLE SYSTEMS, CONSISTING OF THE POWERBOOK AND IBOOK,

PRODUCED THE STRONGEST REVENUE AND UNIT GROWTH DURING 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 OF

APPROXIMATELY 26% AND 33%, RESPECTIVELY. UNIT SALES OF PORTABLE SYSTEMS

ACCOUNTED FOR 51% OF ALL MACINTOSH SYSTEMS SOLD DURING 2004 COMPARED TO ONLY

42% DURING 2003. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE RESULTS REFLECTED AN OVERALL

TREND IN THE INDUSTRY TOWARDS PORTABLE SYSTEMS. PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANYS

POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS ALSO YIELDED POSITIVE RESULTS IN 2004 OVER 2003,

INCLUDING A 15% AND 6% INCREASE IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE

IN POWER MACINTOSH SALES IN 2004 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE

POWER MAC G5, WHICH BEGAN SHIPPING AT THE END OF 2003. ALTHOUGH POWER MACINTOSH

SALES INCREASED FROM 2003, SALES OF THIS PRODUCT WERE CONSTRAINED IN THE SECOND

HALF OF 2004 AS A RESULT OF MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS AT IBM, THE COMPANYS SOLE

SUPPLIER OF THE POWERPC G5 PROCESSOR.

·

NET SALES OF

IPODS ROSE $961 MILLION OR 279% DURING 2004 COMPARED

TO 2003. UNIT SALES OF IPODS TOTALED 4.4 MILLION IN 2004, WHICH REPRESENTS AN

INCREASE OF 370% FROM THE 939,000 IPOD UNITS SOLD IN 2003. STRONG DEMAND FOR

THE IPODS DURING 2004 WERE EXPERIENCED IN ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING

SEGMENTS AND WAS DRIVEN BY ENHANCEMENTS TO THE IPOD, THE INTRODUCTION OF THE

IPOD MINI, INCREASED EXPANSION OF THE COMPANYS IPOD DISTRIBUTION NETWORK, AND

CONTINUED SUCCESS OF THE ITUNES MUSIC STORE DUE LARGELY TO MAKING IT AVAILABLE

TO BOTH MACINTOSH AND WINDOWS USERS IN THE U.S., U.K., FRANCE, AND GERMANY.

·

THE

RETAIL SEGMENTS NET SALES GREW 91% TO $1.2 BILLION DURING 2004 COMPARED TO

2003. THIS INCREASE WAS LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE INCREASE IN TOTAL STORES

FROM 65 AT THE END OF 2003 TO 86 AT THE END OF 2004, AS WELL AS A 36%

YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE. WHILE THE COMPANYS

CUSTOMERS IN AREAS WHERE THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAS OPENED STORES MAY HAVE ELECTED

TO PURCHASE FROM THE RETAIL SEGMENT STORES RATHER THAN THE COMPANYS

PREEXISTING SALES CHANNELS IN THE U.S. AND JAPAN, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENTS NET SALES IS INCREMENTAL TO THE

COMPANYS TOTAL NET SALES. SEE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BELOW RELATED TO THE RETAIL

SEGMENT UNDER THE HEADING SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE.

·

NET

SALES OF PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE ROSE BY 38% DURING 2004 COMPARED TO

2003 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NET SALES OF DISPLAYS AND OTHER COMPUTER

ACCESSORIES.

NET SALES

OF OTHER

33

COMPUTER ACCESSORIES

INCLUDE AIRPORT CARDS AND BASE STATIONS, ISIGHT DIGITAL VIDEO CAMERAS, AND

THIRD-PARTY HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE INCREASE IN TOTAL NET SALES OF PERIPHERALS

AND OTHER HARDWARE WAS RELATED TO THE OVERALL INCREASE IN MACINTOSH UNIT SALES

AND THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW AND UPDATED PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS AND WAS EXPERIENCED

PREDOMINANTLY BY THE COMPANYS AMERICAS, EUROPE, AND RETAIL SEGMENTS.

·

NET

SALES OF OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCREASED $242 MILLION OR

672% DURING 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED STRONG GROWTH IN

SALES OF IPOD SERVICES AND ACCESSORIES CONSISTENT WITH THE INCREASE IN OVERALL

IPOD UNIT SALES FOR 2004. THE INCREASED SALES FROM THE ITUNES MUSIC STORE,

WHICH WAS ORIGINALLY INTRODUCED IN APRIL 2003, WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO MAKING

THE SERVICE AVAILABLE FOR WINDOWS IN OCTOBER 2003 AND THE INTRODUCTION OF

THE SERVICE IN THE U.K., FRANCE, AND GERMANY IN JUNE 2004.

·

NET

SALES OF SOFTWARE ROSE $140 MILLION OR 39% DURING 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 DUE

PRIMARILY TO HIGHER NET SALES OF THE COMPANYS APPLE-BRANDED SOFTWARE AND IN

PARTICULAR, HIGHER NET SALES OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE,

INCLUDING MAC OS X VERSION 10.3 PANTHER, WHICH WAS RELEASED IN OCTOBER 2003.

NET SALES OF PANTHER ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY $74 MILLION OR OVER 50% OF THE

INCREASE IN SOFTWARE NET SALES FOR 2004 COMPARED TO 2003.

·

THE

COMPANYS U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL EXPERIENCED YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN NET SALES

OF APPROXIMATELY 19% FOR 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. UNIT SALES ALSO INCREASED BY

10% DURING 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. THE INCREASE IN U.S. EDUCATION NET SALES FOR

2004 RELATED PRIMARILY TO A 40% YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN HIGHER EDUCATION NET

SALES AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THE COMPANYS 3% GROWTH IN K-12 NET SALES.

·

SERVICE

AND OTHER SALES INCREASED $37 MILLION OR 13% DURING 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. THESE

INCREASES WERE THE RESULT OF SIGNIFICANT YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES IN NET SALES

ASSOCIATED WITH APP EXTENDED MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT SERVICES, AS WELL AS

INCREASED NET SALES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS .MAC INTERNET SERVICE.

INCREASED NET SALES ASSOCIATED WITH APP WERE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER

MACINTOSH UNIT SALES AND HIGHER ATTACH RATES ON APP OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

YEARS.

OFFSETTING THE

FAVORABLE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANYS NET SALES DURING 2004 WERE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE FOLLOWING.

·

NET

SALES AND UNIT SALES OF IMAC SYSTEMS WERE DOWN 23% AND 16%, RESPECTIVELY,

DURING 2004 VERSUS 2003. THE DECREASE IN IMAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES WAS

LARGELY DUE TO THE DELAY IN THE INTRODUCTION OF THE NEW IMAC, BASED ON THE

POWERPC G5 PROCESSOR, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS

EXPERIENCED BY IBM. THE DELAYS IN THE NEW IMAC RESULTED IN THE DEPLETION OF

INVENTORY OF THE OLD IMAC FLAT PANEL PRIOR TO AVAILABILITY OF THE NEW IMAC G5.

THE OLD FLAT PANEL IMAC FORM FACTOR, WHICH WAS AVAILABLE DURING MOST OF 2004,

WAS NEARLY 3 YEARS OLD BY THE TIME THE NEW IMAC G5 BEGAN SHIPPING IN SEPTEMBER 2004

AND HAD EXPERIENCED DECLINES IN SALES AS A RESULT OF THE AGE OF THIS PRODUCT. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SALES OF IMAC SYSTEMS HAVE ALSO DECLINED DUE TO A SHIFT

IN CONSUMER PREFERENCE TO PORTABLE SYSTEMS AND DESKTOP MODELS FROM COMPETITORS

WITH PRICE POINTS BELOW $1,000.

·

NET SALES AND UNIT SALES IN

THE COMPANYS JAPAN SEGMENT DECREASED 3% AND 14%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2004

VERSUS 2003. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THESE DECLINES RELATED TO A SHIFT IN SALES

FROM THE JAPAN SEGMENT TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT AS A RESULT OF THE TOKYO AND OSAKA

STORE OPENINGS IN 2004. DECLINES IN NET SALES IN JAPAN MAY HAVE ALSO RELATED TO

DELAYS IN COMPUTER UPGRADES BY CERTAIN PROFESSIONAL AND CREATIVE CUSTOMERS

PENDING RELEASE IN JAPAN OF CERTAIN MAC OS X NATIVE APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS QUARK

XPRESS 6, WHICH DID NOT BECOME AVAILABLE UNTIL SEPTEMBER 2004. WHEN SALES

FROM THE JAPAN RETAIL STORES ARE INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS FOR THE JAPAN SEGMENT,

THE COMBINED REVENUE IN JAPAN RESULTED IN A 3% YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN 2004

AS COMPARED TO 2003. SEE

DURING 2005, NET SALES IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT GREW

64% OR $2.6 BILLION COMPARED TO 2004. THE INCREASE IN NET SALES DURING 2005 WAS

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SIGNIFICANT YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN IPOD

SALES, SALES OF OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND STRONG SALES OF

DESKTOP AND PORTABLE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

SHIFT IN SALES TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT, WHICH HAD 117 STORES IN THE U.S. AND

CANADA AS OF THE END OF 2005. MACINTOSH UNIT SALES ALSO INCREASED BY 30% IN

2005 COMPARED TO 2004, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY STRONG SALES OF DESKTOP SYSTEMS

LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO STRONG SALES FROM THE NEW IMAC, WHICH BEGAN SHIPPING IN

SEPTEMBER 2004, AND THE MAC MINI, WHICH WAS INTRODUCED IN JANUARY 2005.

DURING 2005 AND 2004, THE AMERICAS SEGMENT REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 47% AND

49%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL NET SALES AND REPRESENTED

APPROXIMATELY 48% AND 51%, RESPECTIVELY, OF TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES. AS

NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN BOTH U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL

NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF 21% FOR 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. STRENGTH IN HIGHER

EDUCATION SALES RELATED PRIMARILY TO STRONG IMAC SHIPMENTS, PORTABLE SYSTEM

SHIPMENTS, AND ONLINE SALES. THIS STRENGTH DROVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN NET

SALES OF 32% FOR THE HIGHER EDUCATION CHANNEL DURING 2005. DESPITE CHALLENGES

IN THE K-12 MARKET FROM CONTINUED BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES, THE COMPANYS K-12 NET SALES GREW YEAR-OVER-YEAR BY 11% DURING

2005 DUE TO INCREASED IBOOK SALES AND 1:1 EDUCATION SALES.

DURING 2004, NET SALES IN

THE AMERICAS SEGMENT GREW 26% OR $838 MILLION COMPARED TO 2003. THE INCREASE IN

NET SALES DURING 2004 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SIGNIFICANT

YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN IPOD SALES AS WELL AS STRONG SALES OF PERIPHERALS,

SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A SHIFT IN SALES

TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT, WHICH HAD 84 STORES IN THE U.S. AS OF THE END OF 2004.

MACINTOSH UNIT SALES ALSO INCREASED BY 4% IN 2004 COMPARED TO 2003, DRIVEN PRIMARILY

BY STRONG SALES OF PORTABLE AND POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

WEAKNESS IN IMAC SALES. DURING 2004 AND 2003, THE AMERICAS SEGMENT REPRESENTED

APPROXIMATELY 49% AND 51%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL NET SALES AND

REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 51% AND 54%, RESPECTIVELY, OF TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT

SALES. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL NET SALES

OF 19% FOR 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. STRONG U.S. EDUCATION NET SALES FOR 2004

RELATED PRIMARILY TO STRENGTH IN HIGHER EDUCATION NET SALES THAT RESULTED FROM

A SUCCESSFUL BACK-TO-SCHOOL SELLING SEASON WITH STRONG DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS

PORTABLES. THIS STRENGTH DROVE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN NET SALES OF 40% FOR

THE HIGHER EDUCATION CHANNEL DURING 2004. THE COMPANYS K-12 NET SALES

GREW YEAR-OVER-YEAR BY 3% DURING 2004, DESPITE THE CHALLENGES IN THE K-12

MARKET FROM CONTINUED BUDGET CONSTRAINTS AND INCREASED COMPETITION.

EUROPE

DURING 2005, NET SALES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT GREW $1.3

BILLION OR 71% FROM 2004. TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES IN EUROPE ALSO EXPERIENCED

GROWTH DURING THE CURRENT YEAR BY INCREASING 47% IN 2005 COMPARED TO

35

2004. CONSISTENT WITH THE AMERICAS SEGMENT, EUROPE

EXPERIENCED STRONG NET SALES OF DESKTOP PRODUCTS, IPOD, OTHER MUSIC RELATED

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND SOFTWARE AND SERVICE SALES. DEMAND IN EUROPE DURING

2005 WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG FOR THE COMPANYS DESKTOP COMPUTERS, WHICH

EXPERIENCED A YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE OF 56%. SIMILAR TO THE RESULTS OF THE

COMPANYS OTHER SEGMENTS, NET SALES OF IPODS, PERIPHERALS AND SOFTWARE WERE

STRONG IN 2005.

NET SALES IN EUROPE

REBOUNDED IN 2004 INCREASING $490 MILLION OR 37% FROM 2003. TOTAL MACINTOSH

UNIT SALES IN EUROPE ALSO EXPERIENCED GROWTH IN 2004 BY INCREASING 13% COMPARED

TO 2003. CONSISTENT WITH THE AMERICAS SEGMENT, EUROPE EXPERIENCED STRONG NET

SALES ACROSS ALL PRODUCT LINES, EXCEPT THE IMAC SYSTEMS. DEMAND IN EUROPE

DURING 2004 WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG FOR THE COMPANYS POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS

AND PORTABLE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS, WHICH EXPERIENCED YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASES OF

29% AND 42%, RESPECTIVELY. SIMILAR TO THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS OTHER

SEGMENTS, NET SALES OF IPODS, PERIPHERALS AND SOFTWARE WERE STRONG IN 2004 OVER

2003.

JAPAN

JAPANS NET SALES AND MACINTOSH UNIT SALES WERE UP 36%

AND 8%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. JAPAN EXPERIENCED INCREASED

NET SALES IN DESKTOP PRODUCTS, IPOD, AND OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. DESKTOP NET SALES AND UNIT SALES INCREASED BY 31% AND 41%,

RESPECTIVELY, AND IPOD SALES INCREASED BY 220% DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. THE

OVERALL INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN PORTABLE

SYSTEM NET SALES DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004, WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES MIGHT

BE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A SHIFT IN SALES FROM PORTABLES TO THE NEW IMAC G5 AND MAC

MINI, AND A SHIFT TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT AS A RESULT OF OPENING TWO ADDITIONAL

STORES IN JAPAN DURING 2005.

JAPANS NET SALES AND

MACINTOSH UNIT SALES WERE DOWN 3% AND 14%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2004 COMPARED

TO 2003, WHICH LAGGED BEHIND ALL OF THE COMPANYS OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS. THESE

DECREASES IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES WERE BELIEVED TO BE ATTRIBUTABLE IN PART

TO A SHIFT IN SALES FROM THE JAPAN SEGMENT TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT AS A RESULT OF

THE OPENING OF TWO STORES IN JAPAN IN 2004. IN ADDITION, SUCH DECREASES MAY

HAVE BEEN RELATED TO DELAYED COMPUTER SYSTEM UPGRADES BY SOME PROFESSIONAL AND

CREATIVE CUSTOMERS WHO WERE AWAITING THE RELEASE OF QUARK XPRESS 6 FOR MAC OS

X, WHICH DID NOT OCCUR UNTIL SEPTEMBER 2004. THE DECREASE IN NET SALES WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STRONG IPOD AND IBOOK SALES DURING 2004 COMPARED TO 2003.

RETAIL

THE COMPANY OPENED 38 NEW RETAIL STORES DURING 2005,

INCLUDING 6 INTERNATIONAL STORES IN THE U.K, JAPAN, AND CANADA, BRINGING THE

TOTAL NUMBER OF OPEN STORES TO 124 AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005. THIS COMPARES

TO 86 OPEN STORES AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004 AND 65 OPEN STORES AS OF SEPTEMBER 27,

2003.

NET SALES OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT GREW TO $2.4 BILLION

DURING 2005 FROM $1.2 BILLION AND $621 MILLION IN 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCREASES IN NET SALES DURING BOTH 2005 AND 2004 REFLECT THE IMPACT OF NEW

STORE OPENINGS FOR EACH YEAR, INCLUDING THE OPENING OF 38 NEW STORES IN 2005

AND 21 NEW STORES IN 2004. AN INCREASE IN AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE ALSO

CONTRIBUTED TO THE SEGMENTS STRONG SALES IN 2005. WITH AN AVERAGE OF 105

STORES OPEN DURING 2005, THE RETAIL SEGMENT ACHIEVED ANNUALIZED REVENUE PER

STORE OF APPROXIMATELY $22.4 MILLION, AS COMPARED TO $15.6 MILLION IN 2004 WITH

A 76 STORE AVERAGE, AND $11.5 MILLION IN 2003 WITH A 54 STORE AVERAGE.

AS MEASURED BY THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENT

REPORTING, THE RETAIL SEGMENT REPORTED OPERATING INCOME OF $151 MILLION DURING

2005 AS COMPARED TO OPERATING INCOME OF $39 MILLION DURING 2004 AND AN

OPERATING LOSS OF $5 MILLION DURING 2003. THIS IMPROVEMENT IS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SEGMENTS YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN AVERAGE REVENUE PER

STORE, THE IMPACT OF OPENING NEW STORES, AND THE SEGMENTS YEAR-OVER-YEAR

INCREASE IN NET SALES, WHICH RESULTED IN HIGHER LEVERAGE ON OCCUPANCY,

DEPRECIATION, AND OTHER FIXED COSTS.

36

EXPANSION OF THE RETAIL

SEGMENT HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN

FIXED ASSETS AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE, OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS,

PERSONNEL, AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH

THE RETAIL SEGMENT WERE $132 MILLION IN 2005, BRINGING THE TOTAL CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES SINCE INCEPTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT TO APPROXIMATELY $529

MILLION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAD APPROXIMATELY

3,673 EMPLOYEES AND HAD OUTSTANDING OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH

RETAIL STORE SPACE AND RELATED FACILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $606 MILLION. THE

COMPANY WOULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS SHOULD IT CHOOSE TO TERMINATE ITS RETAIL

SEGMENT OR CLOSE INDIVIDUAL STORES. SUCH COSTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

GROSS MARGIN INCREASED IN 2005 TO 29.0% OF NET SALES

FROM 27.3% OF NET SALES IN 2004. THE COMPANYS GROSS MARGIN DURING 2005

INCREASED DUE TO MORE FAVORABLE PRICING ON CERTAIN COMMODITY COMPONENTS

INCLUDING LCD FLAT-PANEL DISPLAYS AND DRAM MEMORY; AN INCREASE IN HIGHER MARGIN

SOFTWARE SALES; A FAVORABLE SHIFT IN DIRECT SALES RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE

COMPANYS RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES; AND HIGHER OVERALL REVENUE THAT PROVIDED

FOR MORE LEVERAGE ON FIXED PRODUCTION COSTS. THESE INCREASES TO GROSS MARGIN

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LOWER MARGIN IPOD SALES.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ITS GROSS MARGIN AND THE

GROSS MARGIN OF THE OVERALL PERSONAL COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS

INDUSTRIES WILL REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE IN LIGHT OF PRICE COMPETITION, ESPECIALLY

FOR THE IPOD PRODUCT LINE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE TO

DECLINE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN THE

MIX OF REVENUE TOWARD LOWER MARGIN PRODUCTS SUCH AS THE IPOD AND CONTENT FROM

THE ITUNES MUSIC STORE.

THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANYS

EXPECTED GROSS MARGIN ARE FORWARD-LOOKING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

CURRENT GROSS MARGINS WILL BE MAINTAINED OR TARGETED GROSS MARGIN LEVELS WILL

BE ACHIEVED. IN GENERAL, GROSS MARGINS AND MARGINS ON INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS,

INCLUDING IPODS, WILL REMAIN UNDER SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD PRESSURE DUE TO A

VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED INDUSTRY WIDE GLOBAL PRICING PRESSURES,

INCREASED COMPETITION, COMPRESSED PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, POTENTIAL INCREASES IN

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIAL AND OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES,

AND POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS PRODUCT MIX, INCLUDING HIGHER UNIT SALES

OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS WITH LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND LOWER GROSS MARGINS.

IN RESPONSE TO THESE DOWNWARD PRESSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE

TO TAKE PRICING ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITS PRODUCTS. GROSS MARGINS COULD ALSO

BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE PRODUCT QUALITY AND

WARRANTY COSTS AND TO STIMULATE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS. DUE TO THE

COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL RESULTS CAN BE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED IN THE SHORT-TERM BY FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES.

37

THE COMPANY ORDERS COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND

BUILDS INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANYS MARKETS

ARE VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, THERE IS A RISK

THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND PRODUCE OR ORDER FROM THIRD-PARTIES

EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS. THE

COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN AND

MAY IN THE FUTURE BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

MANAGE ITS INVENTORY LEVELS AND OUTSTANDING PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND TO RESPOND

TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

GROSS MARGIN DECLINED IN

2004 TO 27.3% OF NET SALES FROM 27.5% OF NET SALES IN 2003. THE COMPANYS GROSS

MARGIN DURING 2004 DECLINED DUE TO AN INCREASE IN MIX TOWARDS LOWER MARGIN IPOD

AND IBOOK SALES, PRICING ACTIONS ON CERTAIN POWER MACINTOSH G5 MODELS THAT WERE

TRANSITIONED DURING THE BEGINNING OF 2004, HIGHER WARRANTY COSTS ON CERTAIN

PORTABLE MACINTOSH PRODUCTS, AND HIGHER FREIGHT AND DUTY COSTS DURING 2004. THESE

UNFAVORABLE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN DIRECT SALES AND A

39% YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN HIGHER MARGIN SOFTWARE SALES.

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT (R&D)

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES

THAT FOCUSED INVESTMENTS IN R&D ARE CRITICAL TO ITS FUTURE GROWTH AND

COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO TIMELY

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE COMPANYS CORE

BUSINESS STRATEGY. THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY RELIED UPON INNOVATION TO REMAIN

COMPETITIVE. R&D EXPENSE AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY 4% OF TOTAL NET SALES

DURING 2005 DOWN FROM 6% AND 8% OF TOTAL NET SALES IN 2004 AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY. THIS DECREASE IS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OF 68% IN TOTAL

NET SALES OF THE COMPANY FOR 2005. ALTHOUGH R&D EXPENSE DECREASED AS A

PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES IN 2005, ACTUAL EXPENSE FOR R&D IN 2005

INCREASED $45 MILLION OR 9% FROM 2004, WHICH FOLLOWS AN $18 MILLION OR 4%

INCREASE IN 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. THE OVERALL INCREASE IN R&D EXPENSE

RELATES PRIMARILY TO INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND SUPPORT FOR NEW PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE IMPACT OF EMPLOYEE SALARY INCREASES IN 2005.

R&D EXPENSE DOES NOT INCLUDE CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF

APPROXIMATELY $29.7 MILLION RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X TIGER DURING

2005; $4.5 MILLION RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X TIGER AND $2.3

MILLION RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF FILEMAKER PRO 7 IN 2004; AND $14.7

MILLION RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X PANTHER IN 2003. FURTHER

INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

COSTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTE

1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SELLING, GENERAL,

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (SG&A)

EXPENDITURES FOR SG&A INCREASED $438 MILLION OR

31% DURING 2005 COMPARED TO 2004. THESE INCREASES ARE DUE PRIMARILY TO THE

COMPANYS CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT IN BOTH DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, A CURRENT YEAR INCREASE IN DISCRETIONARY SPENDING ON

MARKETING AND ADVERTISING, AND HIGHER DIRECT AND CHANNEL SELLING EXPENSES

RESULTING FROM THE INCREASE IN NET SALES AND EMPLOYEE SALARY

38

MERIT INCREASES. SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET

SALES IN 2005 WAS 13%, DOWN FROM 17% IN 2004, WHICH IS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN

TOTAL NET SALES OF 68% FOR THE COMPANY DURING 2005.

EXPENDITURES FOR SG&A

INCREASED $209 MILLION OR 17% DURING 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. THESE INCREASES

WERE DUE PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANYS CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT

IN BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AN INCREASE IN DISCRETIONARY

SPENDING ON MARKETING AND ADVERTISING, AN INCREASE IN AMORTIZATION COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH RESTRICTED STOCK COMPENSATION, AND HIGHER DIRECT AND CHANNEL

SELLING EXPENSES RESULTING FROM THE INCREASE IN NET SALES AND EMPLOYEE SALARY

MERIT INCREASES. SG&A AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL NET SALES IN 2004 WAS 17%,

DOWN FROM 20% IN 2003 DUE TO THE INCREASE IN TOTAL NET SALES FOR THE COMPANY OF

33% DURING 2004.

FISCAL 2004

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDED TOTAL

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $23 MILLION DURING 2004, INCLUDING

APPROXIMATELY $14 MILLION IN SEVERANCE COSTS, $5.5 MILLION IN ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS, AND A $3.5 MILLION CHARGE FOR LEASE CANCELLATIONS IN CONJUNCTION

WITH THE VACATING OF A LEASED SALES FACILITY IN EUROPE DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2004 RELATED TO A EUROPEAN WORKFORCE REDUCTION. OF THE $23 MILLION

CHARGE, $19.7 MILLION HAD BEEN UTILIZED BY THE END OF 2005, WITH THE REMAINING

$3.3 MILLION CONSISTING OF $0.7 MILLION FOR EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE BENEFITS AND

$2.6 MILLION FOR LEASE CANCELLATIONS. THESE ACTIONS WILL RESULT IN THE

TERMINATION OF 461 EMPLOYEES, 448 OF WHICH HAD BEEN TERMINATED PRIOR TO THE END

OF 2005.

FISCAL 2003

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDED TOTAL

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $26.8 MILLION DURING 2003, INCLUDING

APPROXIMATELY $7.4 MILLION IN SEVERANCE COSTS, A $5.0 MILLION CHARGE TO

WRITE-OFF DEFERRED COMPENSATION, $7.1 MILLION IN ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, AND A $7.3

MILLION CHARGE FOR LEASE CANCELLATIONS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CLOSURE OF THE

COMPANYS SINGAPORE MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003.

OF THE $26.8 MILLION CHARGE, ALL HAD BEEN UTILIZED BY THE END OF 2005, EXCEPT

FOR APPROXIMATELY $1.7 MILLION RELATED TO OPERATING LEASE COSTS ON ABANDONED

FACILITIES. THESE ACTIONS RESULTED IN THE TERMINATION OF 353 EMPLOYEES.

NON-CURRENT INVESTMENTS IN 2004 AND 2003. PRETAX GAINS RECORDED UPON THE SALE

INTEREST AND OTHER

INCOME, NET

TOTAL INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET INCREASED $112

MILLION OR 211% TO $165 MILLION DURING 2005 COMPARED TO $53 MILLION IN

2004 AND $83 MILLION IN 2003. THESE INCREASES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO

INCREASING INVESTMENT YIELDS ON THE COMPANYS CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

AND HIGHER INVESTED BALANCES. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED BY THE

COMPANY ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS INCREASED TO

2.70% IN 2005 COMPARED TO THE 1.38% AND 1.89% RATES EARNED DURING 2004 AND

2003, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY OCCASIONALLY SELLS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS PRIOR

TO THEIR STATED MATURITIES. AS A RESULT OF SUCH SALES, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED

NET LOSSES OF $137,000 IN 2005 AND NET GAINS OF $1 MILLION AND $21 MILLION

DURING 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME WERE HIGHER FOREIGN

CURRENCY HEDGING EXPENSES.

INTEREST EXPENSE CONSISTED

PRIMARILY OF INTEREST ON THE COMPANYS $300 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT UNSECURED NOTES, WHICH WERE REPAID UPON THEIR MATURITY IN FEBRUARY 2004.

THE UNSECURED NOTES WERE SOLD AT 99.925% OF PAR FOR AN EFFECTIVE YIELD TO

MATURITY OF 6.51%. TOTAL DEFERRED GAIN RESULTING FROM THE CLOSURE OF DEBT SWAPS

OF APPROXIMATELY $23 MILLION WAS FULLY AMORTIZED AS OF THE NOTES MATURITY IN FEBRUARY 2004.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 24,

2005 WAS APPROXIMATELY 26%. THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE RATE DIFFERS FROM THE

STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE OF 35% DUE PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED

FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE

INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S., RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

TAX CREDITS, AND A REDUCTION OF CERTAIN TAX CONTINGENCY RESERVES AND

ADJUSTMENTS TO NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE BENEFIT FROM ADJUSTMENTS TO TAX

CONTINGENCY RESERVES AND NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WAS $67 MILLION. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY RECORDED A $25 MILLION REDUCTION OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE

ASSOCIATED WITH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS THAT, IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION, ARE NOW MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED IN THE FUTURE. $14 MILLION OF THE VALUATION

ALLOWANCE REDUCTION WAS RECORDED AS A CREDIT TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE, AND THE

REMAINDER WAS RECORDED AS A CREDIT TO GOODWILL.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARISING FROM DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TAX LOSSES,

AND TAX CREDITS OF $767 MILLION BEFORE BEING OFFSET AGAINST CERTAIN DEFERRED

TAX LIABILITIES AND A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR PRESENTATION ON THE COMPANYS

BALANCE SHEET. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED

INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX

PLANNING STRATEGIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING NET

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 2004,

A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $5 MILLION AND $30 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WAS

RECORDED AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR THE BENEFITS OF TAX LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS THAT MAY NOT BE REALIZED. THE REMAINING VALUATION ALLOWANCE AT SEPTEMBER 24,

2005 RELATES PRINCIPALLY TO CERTAIN STATE OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS. THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE REALIZABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS

QUARTERLY BY ASSESSING THE NEED FOR AND AMOUNT OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) HAS COMPLETED ITS

FIELD AUDIT OF THE COMPANYS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR ALL YEARS PRIOR TO

2002 AND PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. CERTAIN OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE BEING

CONTESTED THROUGH THE IRS APPEALS OFFICE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL IRS AUDIT ISSUES

FOR THESE YEARS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO

AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT

ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX

EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH

CERTAINTY. SHOULD ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANYS TAX AUDITS BE RESOLVED

IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE

REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION

OCCURS.

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004,

THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT (AJCA) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE AJCA INCLUDES A PROVISION

FOR THE DEDUCTION OF 85% OF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT ARE REPATRIATED, AS

DEFINED IN THE

40

AJCA. THE LEGISLATION

PROVIDED THE COMPANY WITH THE OPTION TO APPLY THIS PROVISION TO REPATRIATIONS

OF QUALIFYING EARNINGS IN EITHER 2005 OR 2006. THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO

EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF THE REPATRIATION PROVISION AND EXPECTS TO COMPLETE THE

EVALUATION IN 2006. A MAXIMUM OF $755 MILLION MAY BE ELIGIBLE FOR REPATRIATION

UNDER THE REDUCED TAX RATE PROVIDED BY AJCA. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES

AND COMPLEXITIES OF THE REPATRIATION PROVISION AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUING

EVALUATION, THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET DETERMINED THE AMOUNT THAT MAY BE

REPATRIATED OR THE RELATED POTENTIAL INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF SUCH REPATRIATION.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF

. FSP NOS. FAS 115-1 AND FAS 124-1

INCLUDE GUIDANCE FOR EVALUATING AND RECORDING IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON DEBT AND

EQUITY INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR INVESTMENTS THAT

ARE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. FSP NOS. FAS 115-1 AND FAS 124-1

ALSO REQUIRE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRED DEBT SECURITIES TO BE WRITTEN DOWN

TO ITS IMPAIRED VALUE, WHICH BECOMES THE NEW COST BASIS. FSP NOS. FAS 115-1

AND FAS 124-1 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2005. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF FSP

NOS. FAS 115-1 AND FAS 124-1, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY

BELIEVE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 151,

INVENTORY COSTS

, WHICH AMENDS THE

GUIDANCE IN ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN (ARB) NO. 43, CHAPTER 4,

INVENTORY PRICING

, TO CLARIFY THE ACCOUNTING FOR ABNORMAL

AMOUNTS OF FACILITY EXPENSE, FREIGHT, HANDLING COSTS, AND WASTED MATERIAL

(SPOILAGE). ARB 43, CHAPTER 4, PREVIOUSLY STATED THAT UNDER SOME

CIRCUMSTANCES, ITEMS SUCH AS IDLE FACILITY EXPENSE, EXCESSIVE SPOILAGE, DOUBLE

FREIGHT, AND REHANDLING COSTS MAY BE SO ABNORMAL AS TO REQUIRE TREATMENT AS

CURRENT PERIOD CHARGES. SFAS 151 REQUIRES THAT THOSE ITEMS BE RECOGNIZED AS

CURRENT-PERIOD CHARGES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY MEET THE CRITERION OF SO

ABNORMAL. IN ADDITION, SFAS 151 REQUIRES THAT ALLOCATION OF FIXED PRODUCTION

OVERHEAD TO THE COSTS OF CONVERSION BE BASED ON THE NORMAL CAPACITY OF THE

PRODUCTION FACILITIES. SFAS 151 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15,

2005. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF SFAS

151, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FSP 109-2,

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE FOR THE FOREIGN

EARNINGS REPATRIATION PROVISION WITHIN THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004.

FSP 109-2 PROVIDES ADDITIONAL TIME TO COMPANIES BEYOND THE FINANCIAL

REPORTING PERIOD OF ENACTMENT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF THE AJCA ON THEIR

PLANS FOR REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR PURPOSES OF APPLYING SFAS 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

EVALUATING THE REPATRIATION PROVISIONS OF AJCA, WHICH IF IMPLEMENTED BY THE

COMPANY WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS TAX PROVISION AND DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES AND COMPLEXITIES OF THE

REPATRIATION PROVISION AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUING EVALUATION, IT IS NOT

POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT, IF ANY, THAT WILL BE REPATRIATED

OR THE RELATED POTENTIAL INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF SUCH REPATRIATION. THE COMPANY

EXPECTS TO COMPLETE THE EVALUATION IN 2006.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 123

(REVISED 2004) (SFAS NO. 123R),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

,

THAT ADDRESSES THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH AN

ENTERPRISE RECEIVES EMPLOYEE SERVICES IN EXCHANGE FOR (A) EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS OF THE ENTERPRISE OR (B) LIABILITIES THAT ARE BASED ON THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE ENTERPRISES EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OR THAT MAY BE SETTLED BY THE

ISSUANCE OF SUCH

41

EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. SFAS NO. 123R ELIMINATES THE

ABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS USING THE

INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

,

AND INSTEAD REQUIRES SUCH TRANSACTIONS BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING A

FAIR-VALUE-BASED METHOD. THE COMPANY WILL RECOGNIZE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE ON ALL AWARDS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE

PERIOD USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE METHOD. IN JANUARY 2005, THE SEC

ISSUED SAB NO. 107, WHICH PROVIDES SUPPLEMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE

FOR SFAS NO. 123R. SFAS NO. 123R WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY

BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE ADOPTION

OF SFAS NO. 123R WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON

SHARE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.03 FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006.

IN MARCH 2005, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. (FIN)

47,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS,

TO CLARIFY THE REQUIREMENT TO RECORD LIABILITIES

STEMMING FROM A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PERFORM AN ASSET RETIREMENT ACTIVITY IN

WHICH THE TIMING OR METHOD OF SETTLEMENT IS CONDITIONAL ON A FUTURE EVENT. THE

COMPANY PLANS TO ADOPT FIN 47 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006, AND DOES NOT

EXPECT THE APPLICATION OF FIN 47 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN MAY 2005, THE FASB

ISSUED SFAS NO. 154,

ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND

ERROR CORRECTIONS

WHICH REPLACES APB OPINION NO. 20

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

AND SFAS NO. 3,

REPORTING

ACCOUNTING CHANGES IN INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTSAN AMENDMENT OF APB OPINION NO. 28.

SFAS NO. 154 REQUIRES RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO PRIOR PERIODS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF A VOLUNTARY CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPAL UNLESS IT IS

NOT PRACTICABLE. SFAS NO. 154 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND

CORRECTIONS OF ERRORS MADE IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2005 AND IS REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

FISCAL 2007. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF

SFAS NO. 154, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD $8.261

BILLION IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AN INCREASE OF

$2.797 BILLION OVER THE SAME BALANCES AT THE END OF 2004. THE PRINCIPAL

COMPONENTS OF THIS INCREASE WERE ­CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF

$2.535 BILLION AND PROCEEDS OF $543 MILLION FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK

UNDER STOCK PLANS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CASH USED TO

42

PURCHASE PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT OF $260

MILLION. THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY INVESTED IN

HIGH CREDIT QUALITY, LIQUID INVESTMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005,

APPROXIMATELY $4.3 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS WERE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ARE GENERALLY BASED IN U.S.

DOLLAR-DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. AMOUNTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE

GENERALLY SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXATION ON REPATRIATION TO THE U.S. THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE IMPACT OF THE ONE-TIME FAVORABLE FOREIGN

DIVIDEND PROVISIONS RECENTLY ENACTED AS PART OF THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT

OF 2004, AND MAY DECIDE TO REPATRIATE EARNINGS FROM SOME OF ITS FOREIGN

SUBSIDIARIES.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS

EXISTING BALANCES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY ITS WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

STOCK REPURCHASE ACTIVITY, OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS, AND OTHER LIQUIDITY

REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EXISTING OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES

THE COMPANYS TOTAL

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $260 MILLION DURING 2005, $132 MILLION OF WHICH WERE

FOR RETAIL STORE FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT RELATED TO THE COMPANYS RETAIL

SEGMENT AND $128 MILLION OF WHICH WERE PRIMARILY FOR CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE,

INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENTS AND OPERATING FACILITIES ENHANCEMENTS

AND EXPANSIONS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY

ANTICIPATES IT WILL UTILIZE APPROXIMATELY $390 MILLION FOR CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES DURING 2006, APPROXIMATELY $210 MILLION OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE

UTILIZED FOR FURTHER EXPANSION OF THE COMPANYS RETAIL SEGMENT AND THE

REMAINDER UTILIZED TO SUPPORT NORMAL REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING CAPITAL ASSETS AND

ENHANCEMENTS TO GENERAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE.

STOCK REPURCHASE

PLAN

IN JULY 1999, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

AUTHORIZED A PLAN FOR THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE UP TO $500 MILLION OF ITS

COMMON STOCK. THIS REPURCHASE PLAN DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY

SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES OR ACQUIRE SHARES OVER ANY SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. SINCE

INCEPTION OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN, THE COMPANY HAD REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF

13.1 MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF $217 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENGAGED IN

ANY TRANSACTIONS TO REPURCHASE ITS COMMON STOCK DURING 2005 OR 2004. THE

COMPANY WAS AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $283 MILLION OF ITS COMMON

STOCK AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005.

ON FEBRUARY 28, 2005,

THE COMPANY EFFECTED A TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF FEBRUARY 18,

2005. ALL SHARE AND PER SHARE INFORMATION HAS BEEN RETROACTIVELY ADJUSTED TO

REFLECT THE STOCK SPLIT.

OFF-BALANCE

SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY TRANSACTIONS WITH

THE COMPANY

HAD TOTAL OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS ON NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES OF

APPROXIMATELY $865 MILLION, $606 MILLION OF WHICH RELATED TO THE LEASE OF

RETAIL SPACE AND RELATED FACILITIES. LEASE TERMS ON THE COMPANYS EXISTING

MAJOR FACILITY OPERATING LEASES RANGE FROM 5 TO 20 YEARS.

PURCHASE

COMMITMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS

THE COMPANY UTILIZES SEVERAL CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO

MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND TO PERFORM FINAL

ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF FINISHED PRODUCTS. THESE CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ACQUIRE

COMPONENTS AND BUILD PRODUCT BASED ON DEMAND INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE

COMPANY, WHICH TYPICALLY COVERS PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. THE

COMPANY ALSO OBTAINS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY

OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY

ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER

CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE

COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANYS FORECASTED COMPONENT AND

MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24,

2005, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING COMMITMENTS AND

COMPONENT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION.

SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 24,

2005, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS WITH HYNIX

SEMICONDUCTOR, INC., INTEL CORPORATION, MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC.,

SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION TO SECURE SUPPLY OF NAND

FLASH MEMORY THROUGH CALENDAR YEAR 2010. AS PART OF THESE AGREEMENTS, THE

COMPANY INTENDS TO PREPAY A TOTAL OF $1.25 BILLION FOR FLASH MEMORY COMPONENTS

BY THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006.

ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANYS ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH COMMITMENTS TO RETURN PROPERTY

SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES TO ORIGINAL CONDITION UPON LEASE TERMINATION. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT GROSS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS OF APPROXIMATELY $14 MILLION WILL BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS.

OTHER OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANYS OTHER

OBLIGATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION ARE PRIMARILY RELATED TO INTERNET AND

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES

NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE

AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE

INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY

44

COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS

AND/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN

INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY

SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST

ITSELF OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY AND, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, DOES

NOT HAVE A LIABILITY RELATED TO UNRESOLVED INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS SUBJECT TO

INDEMNIFICATION THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL

CONDITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FACTORS

THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING

FACTORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION, PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE

A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT USE

HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CURRENT ECONOMIC AND

POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS AND THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF ITS SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND

RESELLERS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATING

PERFORMANCE DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE U.S.

AND ABROAD. AT TIMES IN THE PAST, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS HAS BEEN

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DIFFICULT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. ADDITIONALLY, SOME

OF THE COMPANYS EDUCATION CUSTOMERS APPEARED TO BE DELAYING TECHNOLOGY

PURCHASES DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE OVERALL IMPACT OF THE WEAKER ECONOMY AND

STATE BUDGET DEFICITS ON THEIR AVAILABLE FUNDING. ALTHOUGH RECENT MACROECONOMIC

TRENDS SEEM TO INDICATE AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY, CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY ABOUT

FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO FORECAST FUTURE DEMAND FOR THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND RELATED OPERATING RESULTS. SHOULD GLOBAL AND/OR REGIONAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AS COULD THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF ITS SUPPLIERS,

DISTRIBUTORS, AND RESELLERS.

WAR, TERRORISM, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES OR OTHER BUSINESS

INTERRUPTIONS COULD DISRUPT SUPPLY, DELIVERY OR DEMAND OF PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE.

WAR, TERRORISM, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AND OTHER

BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS WHETHER IN THE U.S. OR ABROAD, HAVE CAUSED AND COULD

CAUSE DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION TO INTERNATIONAL

COMMERCE

BY CREATING ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT MAY HAVE A STRONG

NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY,

THE COMPANY, AND THE COMPANYS

SUPPLIERS OR CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANYS MAJOR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

INTERRUPTION BY EARTHQUAKE, OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS, FIRE, POWER SHORTAGES,

TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER HOSTILE ACTS, LABOR DISPUTES, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES,

AND OTHER EVENTS BEYOND ITS CONTROL. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, ITS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

SYSTEMS, AND OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN COMPONENT

SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS, ARE LOCATED NEAR MAJOR SEISMIC FAULTS.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY DOES NOT CARRY EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE FOR DIRECT

QUAKE-RELATED LOSSES, THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE OR

OTHER NATURAL OR MANMADE DISASTER.

ALTHOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE

TO PREDICT THE OCCURRENCES OR CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH EVENTS, SUCH EVENTS

COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, MAKE IT

DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS OR

TO RECEIVE COMPONENTS FROM ITS SUPPLIERS, AND COULD CREATE DELAYS AND

INEFFICIENCIES IN THE COMPANYS SUPPLY CHAIN. IN ADDITION, SHOULD MAJOR PUBLIC

HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING PANDEMICS, ARISE, THE COMPANY COULD BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY THE NEED FOR MORE STRINGENT EMPLOYEE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS,

ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS IN THE AVAILABILITY OF FREIGHT SERVICES, GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS BETWEEN VARIOUS REGIONS, DELAYS IN

PRODUCTION RAMPS OF NEW PRODUCTS, AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE

COMPANYS MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS. THE COMPANYS

OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY BE,

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE EVENTS.

45

THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED

PERIPHERALS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS DIGITAL MUSIC DEVICES AND RELATED

SERVICES, IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY

COMPETE IN THESE MARKETS, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE PRICING PRACTICES, DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON

GROSS MARGINS, FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, SHORT PRODUCT LIFE

CYCLES, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT

PRICE/PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS, RAPID ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT

ADVANCEMENTS BY COMPETITORS, PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS, AND A

LARGE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, PRICE COMPETITION IN

THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED PERIPHERALS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY

INTENSE AS COMPETITORS WHO SELL WINDOWS AND LINUX BASED PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAVE

AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED THEIR PRODUCT MARGINS FOR PERSONAL

COMPUTING PRODUCTS. THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE

AND OTHER INDUSTRY-WIDE PRICING PRESSURES AND DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON GROSS

MARGINS.

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY HAS ALSO BEEN

CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITY,

HARDWARE PERFORMANCE, AND FEATURES BASED ON EXISTING OR EMERGING INDUSTRY

STANDARDS. FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS PLACE

MORE RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT

ARE SMALLER AND SIMPLER THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE FOR

MARKET SHARE WITH THE COMPANYS EXISTING PRODUCTS. SEVERAL COMPETITORS OF THE

COMPANY HAVE EITHER TARGETED OR ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION TO TARGET CERTAIN OF

THE COMPANYS KEY MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING CONSUMER, EDUCATION, PROFESSIONAL

AND CONSUMER DIGITAL VIDEO EDITING, AND DESIGN AND PUBLISHING. SEVERAL OF THE

COMPANYS COMPETITORS HAVE INTRODUCED OR ANNOUNCED PLANS TO INTRODUCE DIGITAL

MUSIC PRODUCTS AND/OR ONLINE STORES OFFERING DIGITAL MUSIC DISTRIBUTION THAT

MIMIC MANY OF THE UNIQUE DESIGN, TECHNICAL FEATURES, AND SOLUTIONS OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, MANY

OF WHOM HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, AND TECHNOLOGICAL

RESOURCES, AS WELL AS BROADER PRODUCT LINES AND LARGER INSTALLED CUSTOMER BASES

THAN THOSE OF THE COMPANY. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARDS

CONSOLIDATION IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY THAT HAS RESULTED IN LARGER AND

POTENTIALLY STRONGER COMPETITORS IN THE COMPANYS MARKETS.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY MAKER OF HARDWARE

USING THE MAC OS. THE MAC OS HAS A MINORITY MARKET SHARE IN THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER MARKET, WHICH IS DOMINATED BY MAKERS OF COMPUTERS UTILIZING OTHER

COMPETING OPERATING SYSTEMS, INCLUDING WINDOWS AND LINUX. THE COMPANYS FUTURE

OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON ITS

ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM IN ORDER

TO MAINTAIN PERCEIVED DESIGN AND FUNCTIONAL ADVANTAGES OVER COMPETING PLATFORMS.

ADDITIONALLY, IF UNAUTHORIZED COPIES OF THE MAC OS ARE USED ON OTHER COMPANIES

HARDWARE PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN DECREASED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS HARDWARE

PRODUCTS, THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON MARKET

OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO DIGITAL MUSIC DISTRIBUTION AND RELATED CONSUMER

ELECTRONIC DEVICES, INCLUDING IPODS. THE COMPANY FACES INCREASING COMPETITION

FROM OTHER COMPANIES PROMOTING THEIR OWN DIGITAL MUSIC PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

MUSIC ENABLED CELL PHONES, DISTRIBUTION SERVICES, AND FREE PEER-TO-PEER MUSIC

SERVICES. THESE COMPETITORS INCLUDE BOTH NEW ENTRANTS WITH DIFFERENT MARKET

APPROACHES, SUCH AS SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES MODELS, AND ALSO LARGER COMPANIES

THAT MAY HAVE GREATER TECHNICAL, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, AND OTHER RESOURCES

THAN THOSE OF THE COMPANY, AS WELL AS ESTABLISHED HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND

DIGITAL CONTENT SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS. FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE COULD

NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT EFFECTIVELY COMPETE IN THESE MARKETS OR SUCCESSFULLY

DISTRIBUTE AND SELL DIGITAL MUSIC OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO HAVE TO

RESPOND TO PRICE COMPETITION BY LOWERING PRICES AND/OR INCREASING FEATURES

WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS MUSIC PRODUCT GROSS MARGINS AS WELL

AS OVERALL COMPANY GROSS MARGINS.

46

THE COMPANY ALSO FACES

INCREASED COMPETITION IN THE U.S. EDUCATION MARKET. U.S. ELEMENTARY AND

SECONDARY SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CUSTOMERS, REMAIN A CORE

MARKET FOR THE COMPANY. UNCERTAINTY IN THIS CHANNEL REMAINS AS SEVERAL

COMPETITORS OF THE COMPANY HAVE EITHER TARGETED OR ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION TO

TARGET THE EDUCATION MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS, WHICH COULD NEGATIVELY

AFFECT THE COMPANYS MARKET SHARE. IN AN EFFORT TO REGAIN MARKET SHARE AND

REMAIN COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE ONE-TO-ONE

(1:1) LEARNING SOLUTIONS IN EDUCATION. 1:1 LEARNING SOLUTIONS TYPICALLY

CONSIST OF IBOOK PORTABLE SYSTEMS FOR EVERY STUDENT AND TEACHER ALONG WITH A

WIRELESS NETWORK CONNECTED TO A CENTRAL SERVER. THESE 1:1 LEARNING SOLUTIONS

AND OTHER STRATEGIC SALES ARE GENERALLY PRICED MORE AGGRESSIVELY AND COULD

RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PROFITABILITY OR EVEN IN FINANCIAL LOSSES,

PARTICULARLY FOR LARGER DEALS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS TAKEN

CERTAIN STEPS TO STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION IN THE EDUCATION MARKET, THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO INCREASE OR MAINTAIN ITS SHARE OF

THE EDUCATION MARKET OR EXECUTE PROFITABLY ON LARGE STRATEGIC ARRANGEMENTS.

FAILURE TO DO SO MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANYS TRANSITION FROM POWERPC MICROPROCESSORS

USED BY MACINTOSH COMPUTERS TO MICROPROCESSORS BUILT BY INTEL IS SUBJECT TO

NUMEROUS RISKS.

IN JUNE 2005, THE

COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO TRANSITION FROM THE USE OF POWERPC

MICROPROCESSORS TO THE USE OF INTEL MICROPROCESSORS IN ALL OF ITS MACINTOSH

COMPUTERS BY THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR 2007. THIS TRANSITION IS SUBJECT TO

NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO TIMELY

DEVELOP AND DELIVER NEW PRODUCTS USING INTEL MICROPROCESSORS, THE TIMELY

INNOVATION AND DELIVERY OF RELATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

THE COMPANYS APPLICATIONS, TO SUPPORT INTEL MICROPROCESSORS, MARKET ACCEPTANCE

OF INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, THE DEVELOPMENT AND AVAILABILITY ON ACCEPTABLE

TERMS OF COMPONENTS AND SERVICES ESSENTIAL TO ENABLE THE COMPANY TO TIMELY

DELIVER INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, AND THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF

INVENTORY LEVELS IN LINE WITH ANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEMAND FOR BOTH POWERPC AND

INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON

THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS SUCH AS MICROSOFT AND ADOBE CONTINUING TO

SUPPORT CURRENT APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON POWERPC-BASED COMPUTERS AND TIMELY

DEVELOPING VERSIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON INTEL AND

POWERPC-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS. THE COMPANYS INABILITY TO TIMELY DELIVER

NEW INTEL-BASED PRODUCTS OR OBTAIN DEVELOPER COMMITMENT BOTH TO CONTINUE

SUPPORTING APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON POWERPC MICROPROCESSORS AND TIMELY

TRANSITION THEIR APPLICATIONS TO RUN NATIVELY ON INTEL-BASED PRODUCTS MAY HAVE

AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANYS

ANNOUNCEMENT OF ITS INTENTION TO TRANSITION TO INTEL MICROPROCESSORS MAY

NEGATIVELY IMPACT SALES OF CURRENT AND FUTURE MACINTOSH PRODUCTS CONTAINING

POWERPC MICROPROCESSORS, AS CUSTOMERS MAY ELECT TO DELAY PURCHASES UNTIL THE

INTEL-BASED PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE. ADDITIONALLY, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS HISTORICAL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGES

ON ITS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, WHICH MAY ADVERSELY

IMPACT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS, INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS,

SOME OF WHICH ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY OR AVAILABLE ONLY FROM LIMITED SOURCES.

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS

INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND ASICS ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM

SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION

DRAM, NAND FLASH-MEMORY, AND TFT-LCD FLAT-PANEL DISPLAYS), WHILE CURRENTLY

AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO

INDUSTRY-WIDE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, NEW PRODUCTS

INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED

FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED

FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IN SITUATIONS WHERE A

COMPONENT OR PRODUCT UTILIZES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS

MAY EXIST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE SUPPLIERS YIELDS HAVE MATURED. THE COMPANY

AND OTHER PRODUCERS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY ALSO COMPETE FOR VARIOUS

COMPONENTS WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE

47

EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE

COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER INDUSTRY INCLUDING CERTAIN MICROPROCESSORS AND ASICS. CONTINUED

AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO

CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMPONENTS OTHER THAN THOSE CUSTOMIZED TO MEET

THE COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY COMPONENT WERE TO BE DELAYED

OR CONSTRAINED ON A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT, THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

PRODUCE AND MARKET COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY AND DESIRE

OF IBM AND FREESCALE SEMICONDUCTOR, INC. (FREESCALE) TO SUPPLY POWERPC

MICROPROCESSORS AND INTEL TO SUPPLY ITS MICROPROCESSORS FOR THE COMPANYS

MACINTOSH COMPUTERS AND TO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF

MICROPROCESSORS WITH PRICE/PERFORMANCE FEATURES THAT COMPARE FAVORABLY TO THOSE

SUPPLIED TO THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS SUPPLY AGREEMENTS

WITH IBM AND FREESCALE, THE COMPANYS RECENT ANNOUNCEMENT OF PLANS TO

TRANSITION TO INTEL MICROPROCESSORS MAY IMPACT THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY ON

ACCEPTABLE TERMS OF CERTAIN COMPONENTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING POWERPC G4 AND

G5 MICROPROCESSORS, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND ARE

CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SOLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. ADDITIONALLY,

THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES IN RECENT YEARS WHERE THE INABILITY OF THE COMPANYS

SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE ADVANCED POWERPC MICROPROCESSORS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY

HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN

ADDITION, IBM IS CURRENTLY THE COMPANYS SOLE SUPPLIER OF THE POWERPC G5

PROCESSOR, WHICH IS USED IN THE COMPANYS CURRENT POWER MAC, XSERVE, AND IMAC

G5 PRODUCTS. FREESCALE IS THE SOLE SUPPLIER OF THE G4 PROCESSOR, WHICH IS USED

IN THE COMPANYS EMAC, MAC MINI, AND PORTABLE PRODUCTS. IBM EXPERIENCED

MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS WITH THE POWERPC G5 PROCESSOR, WHICH RESULTED IN THE

COMPANY DELAYING THE SHIPMENT OF VARIOUS PRODUCTS AND CONSTRAINED CERTAIN

PRODUCT SHIPMENTS DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2004 AND THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005.

MANUFACTURING PROBLEMS EXPERIENCED BY ANY OF THE COMPANYS SUPPLIERS IN THE

FUTURE OR FAILURE BY THEM TO DELIVER COMPONENTS TO THE COMPANY IN SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES WITH COMPETITIVE PRICE/PERFORMANCE FEATURES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY MUST SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE FREQUENT PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE

CUSTOMER DEMAND.

DUE TO THE HIGHLY VOLATILE

AND COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS

INDUSTRIES, WHICH ARE CHARACTERIZED BY DYNAMIC CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS AND

RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUALLY INTRODUCE NEW

PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES, ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO REMAIN

COMPETITIVE, AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND

UPGRADED VERSIONS OF THE COMPANYS EXISTING PRODUCTS. THE SUCCESS OF NEW

PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET

ACCEPTANCE; THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT

TRANSITIONS, INCLUDING THE TRANSITION TO INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, AND

PRODUCTION RAMP ISSUES; THE AVAILABILITY OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR NEW

PRODUCTS; THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF INVENTORY LEVELS IN LINE WITH ANTICIPATED

PRODUCT DEMAND, INCLUDING ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR POWERPC-BASED AND INTEL-BASED

MACINTOSH COMPUTERS; THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN APPROPRIATE QUANTITIES TO

MEET ANTICIPATED DEMAND; AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR

OTHER DEFECTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY

CANNOT DETERMINE IN ADVANCE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT THAT NEW PRODUCTS WILL HAVE ON

ITS SALES OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS FROM TIME TO TIME EXPERIENCE

QUALITY PROBLEMS THAT CAN RESULT IN DECREASED NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFITS.

THE COMPANY SELLS HIGHLY

COMPLEX HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT CAN CONTAIN DEFECTS IN DESIGN AND

MANUFACTURE. SOPHISTICATED OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS

THOSE SOLD BY THE COMPANY, OFTEN CONTAIN BUGS THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE

WITH THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE. DEFECTS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN COMPONENTS AND

PRODUCTS THE COMPANY PURCHASES FROM THIRD-PARTIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT AND FIX ALL DEFECTS IN THE HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE IT SELLS.

48

FAILURE TO DO SO COULD

RESULT IN LOST REVENUE, LOSS OF REPUTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT WARRANTY AND OTHER

EXPENSE TO REMEDY.

BECAUSE ORDERS FOR COMPONENTS, AND IN SOME CASES

COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE COMPONENTS, MUST BE PLACED IN ADVANCE OF CUSTOMER

ORDERS, THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY RISK.

THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF

COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF

ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AND ACCRUES NECESSARY RESERVES FOR

CANCELLATION FEES OF ORDERS FOR INVENTORIES THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED. ALTHOUGH

THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS INVENTORY AND RELATED PROVISIONS ARE CURRENTLY

ADEQUATE, GIVEN THE RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE IN THE

COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES AND THE TRANSITION TO INTEL-BASED

MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR

ADDITIONAL INVENTORY AND RELATED CHARGES. IN ADDITION, SUCH CHARGES HAVE HAD,

AND MAY HAVE, A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER

COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT

SHIPMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANYS MARKETS ARE VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID

TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, AND BECAUSE OF THE TRANSITION TO INTEL-BASED

MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, THERE IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND

PRODUCE OR ORDER FROM THIRD PARTIES EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF

PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, COMPONENTS ARE NORMALLY

ACQUIRED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN

ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANYS FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING

REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. THE COMPANYS OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY

LEVELS AND RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON MANUFACTURING AND

LOGISTICS SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES, MANY OF WHOM ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE

OF THE U.S.

MOST OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN

WHOLE OR IN PART BY THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS

OUTSOURCED MUCH OF ITS TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT. WHILE

OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY LOWER THE COST OF OPERATIONS, THEY ALSO REDUCE THE

COMPANYS DIRECT CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT

EFFECT SUCH DIMINISHED CONTROL WILL HAVE ON THE QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF THE

PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED OR SERVICES RENDERED, OR THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE COMPANY

TO RESPOND TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS. MOREOVER, ALTHOUGH ARRANGEMENTS WITH

SUCH MANUFACTURERS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT,

THE COMPANY MAY REMAIN AT LEAST INITIALLY RESPONSIBLE TO THE CONSUMER FOR

WARRANTY SERVICE IN THE EVENT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS. ANY UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT

DEFECT OR WARRANTY LIABILITY, WHETHER PURSUANT TO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT

MANUFACTURERS OR OTHERWISE, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FUTURE

OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FINAL ASSEMBLY OF PRODUCTS

SOLD BY THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED IN THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING

FACILITY IN CORK, IRELAND, AND BY EXTERNAL VENDORS IN FREMONT, CALIFORNIA,

FULLERTON, CALIFORNIA, TAIWAN, KOREA, THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF CHINA, AND THE

CZECH REPUBLIC. CURRENTLY, MANUFACTURING OF MANY OF THE COMPONENTS USED IN THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS IS PERFORMED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN TAIWAN, CHINA, JAPAN,

KOREA, AND SINGAPORE. FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS

PORTABLE PRODUCTS INCLUDING POWERBOOKS, IBOOKS, AND IPODS IS PERFORMED BY

THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN CHINA. IF FOR ANY REASON MANUFACTURING OR LOGISTICS IN

ANY OF THESE LOCATIONS IS DISRUPTED BY REGIONAL ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, LABOR,

ENVIRONMENTAL, PUBLIC HEALTH, OR POLITICAL ISSUES, AS WELL AS INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES OR MILITARY ACTIONS, THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

49

THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS

DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER RESELLERS OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH

WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS, AND CATALOGUERS, MANY

OF WHOM DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS FROM COMPETING MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY SELLS MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND RESELLS CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN

MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO END USERS, CERTAIN EDUCATION CUSTOMERS,

AND CERTAIN RESELLERS THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD AND ITS RETAIL

STORES. MANY OF THE COMPANYS RESELLERS OPERATE ON NARROW PRODUCT MARGINS AND

HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL

YEARS. CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL OR

CREDIT INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANYS DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL

CHANNEL PARTNERS. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THESE RESELLERS WEAKENS, IF

RESELLERS WITHIN CONSUMER CHANNELS WERE TO CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS, OR IF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS CAUSED

RESELLERS TO REDUCE THEIR ORDERING AND MARKETING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE

COMPANY HAS INVESTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE

RESELLER SALES, INCLUDING STAFFING SELECTED RESELLERS STORES WITH COMPANY

EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS. THESE PROGRAMS COULD REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL

INVESTMENT FROM THE COMPANY, WHILE PROVIDING NO ASSURANCE OF RETURN OR

INCREMENTAL REVENUE TO OFFSET THIS INVESTMENT.

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AN INCREASING PROPORTION

OF THE COMPANYS NET SALES HAS BEEN MADE BY THE COMPANY DIRECTLY TO END-USERS

THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD AND THROUGH ITS RETAIL STORES IN THE

U.S., CANADA, JAPAN, AND THE U.K. SOME OF THE COMPANYS RESELLERS HAVE

PERCEIVED THIS EXPANSION OF THE COMPANYS DIRECT SALES AS CONFLICTING WITH

THEIR OWN BUSINESSES AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS AS DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS OF

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. PERCEPTION OF SUCH A CONFLICT COULD DISCOURAGE THE

COMPANYS RESELLERS FROM INVESTING ADDITIONAL RESOURCES IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND

SALE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS OR LEAD THEM TO LIMIT OR CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF EXPANSION OF ITS DIRECT SALES TO END-USERS CAUSES SOME OR

ALL OF ITS RESELLERS TO CEASE OR LIMIT DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

FURTHER INFORMATION

REGARDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION MAY BE FOUND IN PART I,

ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING MARKETS AND

DISTRIBUTION.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT,

WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR

AT ALL.

THE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO OFFER

THEIR DIGITAL CONTENT TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE COMPANYS ITUNES MUSIC STORE.

THE COMPANY PAYS SUBSTANTIAL FEES TO OBTAIN THE RIGHTS TO OFFER TO ITS

CUSTOMERS THIS THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT. THE COMPANYS LICENSING

ARRANGEMENTS WITH THESE THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS ARE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE

AND DO NOT GUARANTEE THE FUTURE RENEWAL OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AT COMMERCIALLY

REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. CERTAIN PARTIES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY HAVE CONSOLIDATED

AND FORMED ALLIANCES, WHICH COULD LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY AND INCREASE THE FEES

REQUIRED TO OFFER DIGITAL CONTENT TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE ITUNES MUSIC STORE.

FURTHER, SOME THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS CURRENTLY, OR MAY IN THE FUTURE,

OFFER MUSIC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT COMPETE WITH THE COMPANYS MUSIC

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND COULD TAKE ACTION TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR

IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO LICENSE THEIR DIGITAL CONTENT IN THE FUTURE. IF

THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF DIGITAL CONTENT AT

REASONABLE PRICES WITH ACCEPTABLE USAGE RULES, OR CONTINUE TO EXPAND ITS

GEOGRAPHIC REACH OUTSIDE THE U.S., THEN SALES AND GROSS MARGINS OF THE COMPANYS

ITUNES MUSIC STORE AS WELL AS RELATED HARDWARE AND PERIPHERALS, INCLUDING

IPODS, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THIRD-PARTY CONTENT

PROVIDERS AND ARTISTS REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY PROVIDE CERTAIN DIGITAL RIGHTS

MANAGEMENT SOLUTIONS AND OTHER SECURITY MECHANISMS. IF THE REQUIREMENTS FROM

CONTENT PROVIDERS OR ARTISTS CHANGE, THEN THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO

FURTHER DEVELOP OR LICENSE TECHNOLOGY TO ADDRESS SUCH NEW RIGHTS AND

REQUIREMENTS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OR

LICENSE

50

SUCH SOLUTIONS AT A

REASONABLE COST AND IN A TIMELY MANNER, IF AT ALL, WHICH COULD HAVE A

MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

POSITION.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT UPON

SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. IF THIRD-PARTY

SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS CEASE TO BE DEVELOPED OR AVAILABLE FOR THE COMPANYS

HARDWARE PRODUCTS, THEN CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE NOT TO BUY THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DECISIONS BY CUSTOMERS TO

PURCHASE THE COMPANYS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, AS OPPOSED TO WINDOWS-BASED

SYSTEMS, ARE OFTEN BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE FOR

PARTICULAR APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MICROSOFT OFFICE. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES THE

AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS

HARDWARE PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN PART ON THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS PERCEPTION

AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING, MAINTAINING, AND UPGRADING

SUCH SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS VERSUS SOFTWARE FOR THE LARGER WINDOWS

MARKET OR GROWING LINUX MARKET. THIS ANALYSIS MAY BE BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS

THE PERCEIVED STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTS, THE ANTICIPATED

POTENTIAL REVENUE THAT MAY BE GENERATED, CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE BY CUSTOMERS OF

MAC OS X, AND THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING SUCH SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT THE

MINORITY MARKET SHARE HELD BY THE COMPANY IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET HAS

CAUSED SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO QUESTION THE COMPANYS PROSPECTS IN THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER MARKET, DEVELOPERS COULD BE LESS INCLINED TO DEVELOP NEW APPLICATION

SOFTWARE OR UPGRADE EXISTING SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND MORE

INCLINED TO DEVOTE THEIR RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING AND UPGRADING SOFTWARE FOR THE

LARGER WINDOWS MARKET OR GROWING LINUX MARKET. MOREOVER, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE FOR MAC OS X,

THE COMPANYS OPERATING SYSTEM, ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL.

IN JUNE 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS PLAN TO

BEGIN USING INTEL MICROPROCESSORS IN ITS MACINTOSH COMPUTERS. THE COMPANY PLANS

TO BEGIN SHIPPING CERTAIN MODELS WITH INTEL MICROPROCESSORS BY JUNE 2006

AND TO COMPLETE THIS TRANSITION TO INTEL MICROPROCESSORS FOR ALL OF ITS

MACINTOSH COMPUTERS BY THE END OF CALENDAR YEAR 2007. THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON

THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO TIMELY DEVELOP CURRENT AND FUTURE

APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON INTEL AND POWERPC MICROPROCESSORS. THE COMPANYS

INABILITY TO TIMELY DELIVER NEW INTEL-BASED PRODUCTS, OR A DECLINE IN AVAILABLE

APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON THE COMPANYS POWERPC PRODUCTS OR THE LACK OF

APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH SYSTEMS COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN ADDITION, PAST AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT BY THE

COMPANY OF ITS OWN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SOLUTIONS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT

THE DECISION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS, SUCH AS MICROSOFT AND ADOBE, TO DEVELOP,

MAINTAIN, AND UPGRADE SIMILAR OR COMPETITIVE SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY MARKETS AND SELLS A VARIETY OF SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS FOR USE BY PROFESSIONALS, CONSUMERS, AND EDUCATION CUSTOMERS THAT

COULD INFLUENCE THE DECISIONS OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO DEVELOP OR

UPGRADE MACINTOSH-COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS CURRENTLY

MARKETED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE SOFTWARE FOR PROFESSIONAL FILM AND VIDEO

EDITING, PROFESSIONAL COMPOSITING AND VISUAL EFFECTS FOR LARGE FORMAT FILM AND

VIDEO PRODUCTIONS, PROFESSIONAL MUSIC PRODUCTION AND MUSIC POST PRODUCTION,

PROFESSIONAL AND CONSUMER DVD ENCODING AND AUTHORING, PROFESSIONAL DIGITAL

PHOTO EDITING AND WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT, CONSUMER DIGITAL VIDEO AND DIGITAL PHOTO

EDITING AND MANAGEMENT, DIGITAL MUSIC MANAGEMENT, DESKTOP-BASED DATABASE

MANAGEMENT, WORD PROCESSING, AND HIGH-QUALITY PRESENTATIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO

MARKETS AN INTEGRATED PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATION THAT INCORPORATES WORD

PROCESSING, PAGE LAYOUT, IMAGE MANIPULATION, SPREADSHEETS, DATABASES, AND

PRESENTATIONS IN A SINGLE APPLICATION. DISCONTINUANCE OF THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS

FOR THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM, INCLUDING MICROSOFT OFFICE COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS NET SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

51

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS RELIES ON ACCESS TO PATENTS AND

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND THE COMPANYS FUTURE

RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF IT IS ALLEGED OR FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED

ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.

MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN

THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS

PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED UPON PAST

EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE OR AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.

BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGICAL

CHANGES IN THE COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES, CURRENT EXTENSIVE

PATENT COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE

CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY

UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE EXISTING PATENTS OF OTHERS. THE COMPANY HAS FROM TIME TO

TIME BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS OR OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. RESPONDING TO SUCH CLAIMS, REGARDLESS

OF THEIR MERIT, CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING, RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, AND

CAUSE THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. SEVERAL PENDING

CLAIMS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EVALUATION. THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER THE

DESIRABILITY OF ENTERING INTO LICENSING AGREEMENTS IN CERTAIN OF THESE CASES.

HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON

ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR THAT LITIGATION WILL NOT OCCUR. IN THE EVENT THERE IS A

TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION ENTERED PROHIBITING THE COMPANY FROM

MARKETING OR SELLING CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS OR A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM OF

INFRINGEMENT AGAINST THE COMPANY REQUIRING IT TO PAY ROYALTIES TO A

THIRD-PARTY, THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION INVOLVING THE COMPANY RELATED TO ALLEGED PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND

OTHER MATTERS IS SET FORTH IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY

FOR DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES FROM ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS RELATED

TO THE INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS

THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF SUCH

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL

TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THE MATTERS RELATED TO INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS

FORM 10-K OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR

REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANYS RETAIL INITIATIVE HAS REQUIRED AND WILL

CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT AND COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES AND IS

SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

THROUGH OCTOBER 2005, THE COMPANY HAD OPENED 126 RETAIL

STORES. THE COMPANYS RETAIL INITIATIVE HAS REQUIRED SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN

EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INVENTORY, AND

PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO ENTERED INTO SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LEASE

COMMITMENTS FOR RETAIL SPACE WITH LEASE TERMS RANGING FROM 5 TO 20 YEARS, THE

MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE FOR 10 YEARS. THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS

SHOULD IT CHOOSE TO TERMINATE THIS INITIATIVE OR CLOSE INDIVIDUAL STORES. SUCH

COSTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION. ADDITIONALLY, A RELATIVELY HIGH PROPORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENTS

COSTS ARE FIXED BECAUSE OF DEPRECIATION ON STORE CONSTRUCTION COSTS AND LEASE

EXPENSE. AS A RESULT, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES WOULD RESULT SHOULD THE RETAIL SEGMENT

EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES FOR ANY REASON.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS STORES

HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SERVE AS HIGH PROFILE VENUES THAT

FUNCTION

AS VEHICLES FOR GENERAL CORPORATE MARKETING, CORPORATE EVENTS, AND BRAND

AWARENESS. BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN ELEMENTS, LOCATIONS AND SIZE, THESE

STORES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVESTMENT IN

EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS THAN THE COMPANYS MORE TYPICAL

RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANY HAS OPENED SEVEN SUCH STORES THROUGH OCTOBER 2005.

BECAUSE OF THEIR LOCATION AND SIZE, THESE HIGH PROFILE STORES ALSO REQUIRE THE

COMPANY TO ENTER INTO SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS COMPARED

TO THOSE REQUIRED FOR ITS MORE TYPICAL STORES. CURRENT LEASES ON SUCH LOCATIONS

HAVE TERMS RANGING FROM 10 TO 14 YEARS WITH TOTAL

52

REMAINING COMMITMENTS PER

LOCATION RANGING FROM $4 MILLION TO $46 MILLION. CLOSURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE OF

ONE OF THESE HIGH PROFILE STORES COULD HAVE A PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MANY OF THE GENERAL RISKS

AND UNCERTAINTIES THE COMPANY FACES COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS

RETAIL SEGMENT. ALSO, MANY FACTORS UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS PRESENT

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES,

SOME OF WHICH

ARE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RETAIL

SEGMENTS FUTURE RESULTS, CAUSE ITS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE

CURRENTLY EXPECTED, AND/OR HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES UNIQUE TO RETAIL

OPERATIONS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RETAIL SEGMENT INCLUDE,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON

GENERAL RETAIL ACTIVITY; INABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STORE

CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION; FAILURE TO ATTRACT NEW USERS TO THE MACINTOSH

PLATFORM; INABILITY TO SELL THIRD-PARTY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AT

ADEQUATE MARGINS; FAILURE TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING RETAIL CHANNEL

PARTNERS; LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING RETAIL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S.;

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF APPLE-BRANDED

AND THIRD-PARTY RETAIL INVENTORY; AND INABILITY TO OBTAIN QUALITY RETAIL

LOCATIONS AT REASONABLE COST.

INVESTMENT IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES

COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANYS ONGOING BUSINESS AND MAY PRESENT RISKS NOT

ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED.

THE COMPANY HAS AND MAY IN

THE FUTURE INVEST IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES OR ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS THAT

COMPLEMENT THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND PRODUCT ROADMAP. SUCH

ENDEAVORS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING

DISTRACTION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION AWAY FROM NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS;

INSUFFICIENT REVENUE GENERATION TO OFFSET LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND EXPENSES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRATEGY; AND UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES NOT DISCOVERED IN THE

COMPANYS DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS. BECAUSE THESE NEW VENTURES ARE INHERENTLY

RISKY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES WILL BE

SUCCESSFUL AND WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS BUSINESS,

OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DECLINES IN THE SALES OF THE COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL

PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE, ACCESSORIES, OR SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS, OR INCREASES

IN SALES OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IPODS, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE

COMPANYS GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES.

THE COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS, INCLUDING POWER

MACINTOSH AND POWERBOOK SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT

CONTRACTS, GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER GROSS MARGINS THAN THE COMPANYS CONSUMER

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IMACS, IBOOKS, IPODS, AND CONTENT FROM THE ITUNES MUSIC

STORE. A SHIFT IN SALES MIX AWAY FROM HIGHER MARGIN PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS

TOWARDS LOWER MARGIN CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

FUTURE GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES. THE COMPANYS TRADITIONAL

PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE TO BUY CONSUMER PRODUCTS, SPECIFICALLY THE

IMAC G5 AND IBOOK, INSTEAD OF PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS. PROFESSIONAL USERS MAY

CHOOSE TO BUY THE IMAC G5 DUE TO ITS RELATIVE PRICE PERFORMANCE, USE OF THE

SAME POWERPC G5 PROCESSOR USED IN THE COMPANYS POWER MACS, AND UNIQUE DESIGN

FEATURING A FLAT PANEL SCREEN. POTENTIAL POWERBOOK CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO CHOOSE TO

PURCHASE IBOOKS INSTEAD DUE TO THEIR PRICE PERFORMANCE AND SCREEN SIZE.

ADDITIONALLY, SIGNIFICANT FUTURE GROWTH IN IPOD SALES WITHOUT CORRESPONDING

GROWTH IN HIGHER MARGIN PRODUCT SALES COULD ALSO REDUCE GROSS MARGIN AND

OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES.

IT IS LIKELY THAT SOME OF

THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND POTENTIAL

PROFESSIONAL,

CREATIVE, AND SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS, WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO UTILIZE

PROFESSIONAL SYSTEMS,

BELIEVE THAT THE RELATIVELY SLOWER MHZ RATING OR

CLOCK SPEED OF THE MICROPROCESSORS THE COMPANY UTILIZES IN ITS MACINTOSH

SYSTEMS COMPARES UNFAVORABLY TO THOSE UTILIZED BY OTHER COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS

AND TRANSLATES TO SLOWER OVERALL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. THESE FACTORS MAY RESULT

IN AN ADVERSE IMPACT TO SALES OF THE COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS AS WELL AS

TO GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES.

53

THE COMPANY EXPECTS

ITS QUARTERLY REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE FOR A VARIETY OF

REASONS.

THE COMPANYS PROFIT MARGINS

VARY AMONG ITS PRODUCTS AND ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE COMPANYS DIRECT

SALES, PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES, GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER

ASSOCIATED PROFITABILITY THAN ITS INDIRECT SALES. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANYS

DIRECT CHANNELS HAVE TRADITIONALLY HAD MORE SALES OF SOFTWARE AND HIGHER PRICED

HARDWARE PRODUCTS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER GROSS MARGINS, THAN ITS INDIRECT

CHANNELS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANYS GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN

PERCENTAGES AS WELL AS OVERALL PROFITABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS A

RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIC, OR CHANNEL MIX, OR NEW PRODUCT

ANNOUNCEMENTS, INCLUDING THE TRANSITION TO INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY GENERALLY SELLS MORE PRODUCTS DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF

EACH QUARTER THAN IT DOES DURING EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO MONTHS, A PATTERN

TYPICAL IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY. THIS SALES PATTERN CAN PRODUCE

PRESSURE ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF A

QUARTER AND MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO PREDICT ITS FINANCIAL

RESULTS ACCURATELY. DEVELOPMENTS LATE IN A QUARTER, SUCH AS LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED

DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, AN INTERNAL SYSTEMS FAILURE, OR FAILURE OF

ONE OF THE COMPANYS KEY LOGISTICS, COMPONENTS SUPPLIERS, OR MANUFACTURING

PARTNERS, CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THE COMPANY AND ITS RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY HAS HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, THAN

MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AND MAINTAIN ATTRACTIVE GROSS MARGINS AND REVENUE GROWTH

IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY FLOW OF

INNOVATIVE AND COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. AS A

RESULT, THE COMPANY INCURS HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS A

PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE THAN ITS COMPETITORS WHO SELL PERSONAL COMPUTERS BASED ON

OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS. MANY OF THESE COMPETITORS SEEK TO COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY

ON PRICE AND MAINTAIN VERY LOW COST STRUCTURES. FURTHER, AS A RESULT OF THE

EXPANSION OF THE COMPANYS RETAIL SEGMENT AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MARKETING

THE COMPANYS BRAND INCLUDING ITS UNIQUE OPERATING SYSTEM, THE COMPANY INCURS

HIGHER SELLING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE THAN MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS.

IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND SELL INNOVATIVE NEW

PRODUCTS WITH ATTRACTIVE GROSS MARGINS, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ITS OPERATING COST STRUCTURE.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AND PREPAYMENTS RELATED TO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS. THIS RISK IS

HEIGHTENED DURING PERIODS WHEN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORSEN.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES

ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER RESELLERS AND RETAILERS AND DIRECTLY

TO CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. A SUBSTANTIAL

MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE NOT COVERED BY

COLLATERAL OR CREDIT INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS UNSECURED NON-TRADE

RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF ITS MANUFACTURING VENDORS RESULTING FROM THE SALE

BY THE COMPANY OF RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS TO THESE MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHO

MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO SECURE SUPPLY

OF NAND FLASH-MEMORY AND INTENDS TO PREPAY A TOTAL OF $1.25 BILLION UNDER THESE

AGREEMENTS. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO MONITOR AND LIMIT

EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE AND NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES AS WELL AS

LONG-TERM PREPAYMENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH PROCEDURES WILL BE

EFFECTIVE IN LIMITING ITS CREDIT RISK AND AVOIDING LOSSES. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE

GLOBAL ECONOMY AND REGIONAL ECONOMIES FAIL TO IMPROVE OR CONTINUE TO

DETERIORATE, IT BECOMES MORE LIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL INCUR A MATERIAL LOSS

OR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE OF

ITS CUSTOMERS OR MANUFACTURING VENDORS.

THE COMPANYS

SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS

OF THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED

PERSONNEL, INCLUDING ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MEMBERS OF ITS EXECUTIVE TEAM,

AND THOSE IN TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF POSITIONS. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN

THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND COMPETITION FOR

THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY, WHERE THE MAJORITY

OF

54

THE COMPANYS KEY

EMPLOYEES ARE LOCATED. THE COMPANY HAS RELIED ON ITS ABILITY TO GRANT STOCK

OPTIONS AS ONE MECHANISM FOR RECRUITING AND RETAINING THIS HIGHLY SKILLED

TALENT. RECENT ACCOUNTING REGULATIONS REQUIRING THE EXPENSING OF STOCK OPTIONS

WILL IMPAIR THE COMPANYS FUTURE ABILITY TO PROVIDE THESE INCENTIVES WITHOUT

INCURRING SIGNIFICANT COMPENSATION COSTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

THE COMPANY IS

SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SELECTION, AVAILABILITY, AND COST OF

INSURANCE.

THE COMPANY HAS OBSERVED

RAPIDLY CHANGING CONDITIONS IN THE INSURANCE MARKETS RELATING TO NEARLY ALL

AREAS OF TRADITIONAL COMMERCIAL INSURANCE. SUCH CONDITIONS HAVE AND MAY

CONTINUE TO RESULT IN HIGHER PREMIUM COSTS, HIGHER POLICY DEDUCTIBLES, LOWER

COVERAGE LIMITS AND MAY ALSO YIELD POSSIBLE POLICY FORM EXCLUSIONS. FOR SOME

RISKS, BECAUSE OF COST AND/OR AVAILABILITY, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE INSURANCE

COVERAGE. BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS SOME PORTION OF ITS INSURABLE RISKS, AND

IN SOME CASES SELF INSURES COMPLETELY, UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC LOSSES IN

EXCESS OF INSURED LIMITS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

FAILURE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND BREACHES

IN THE SECURITY OF DATA UPON WHICH THE COMPANY RELIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

SYSTEM FAILURES AND BREACHES OF DATA SECURITY COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO FUNCTION IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS BY POTENTIALLY CAUSING

DELAYS OR CANCELLATION OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, IMPEDING THE MANUFACTURE OR SHIPMENT

OF PRODUCTS, OR RESULTING IN THE UNINTENTIONAL DISCLOSURE OF CUSTOMER OR

COMPANY INFORMATION. MANAGEMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS FOR

ITS OWN SYSTEMS BY IMPLEMENTING SOPHISTICATED NETWORK SECURITY AND INTERNAL

CONTROL MEASURES. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A SYSTEM FAILURE OR

DATA SECURITY BREACH OF THE COMPANY OR A THIRD-PARTY VENDOR WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

A LARGE PORTION OF THE COMPANYS REVENUE IS DERIVED

FROM ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND LABOR CONDITIONS,

POLITICAL INSTABILITY, TAX LAWS (INCLUDING U.S. TAXES ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES),

AND CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS THE LOCAL CURRENCY IN WHICH

THE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AND GOODS AND SERVICES ARE PURCHASED. THE COMPANYS

PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATE TO

NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED SALES IN EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, AND CERTAIN

PARTS OF ASIA AND NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED OPERATING EXPENSES INCURRED THROUGHOUT

THE WORLD. WEAKNESSES IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PARTICULARLY THE JAPANESE YEN AND

THE EURO, CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND

THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES. CONVERSELY,

A STRENGTHENING IN THESE AND OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCIES CAN CAUSE THE COMPANY TO

MODIFY INTERNATIONAL PRICING AND AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN

DENOMINATED SALES, AND IN SOME CASES, MAY ALSO INCREASE THE COST TO THE COMPANY

OF SOME PRODUCT COMPONENTS.

MARGINS ON SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN

COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM

FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND

ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE

FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS HAVE BEEN UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE

EXPOSURES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF SUCH

HEDGING ACTIVITIES MAY NOT OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE ADVERSE FINANCIAL

IMPACT RESULTING FROM UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.

55

FURTHER INFORMATION

RELATED TO THE COMPANYS GLOBAL MARKET RISKS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM

7A OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE SUBHEADING FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

AND MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTES

1 AND 2 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY IS

SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.

PRODUCTION AND MARKETING

OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE

REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO RETURN PRODUCT AT THE END OF

ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR

RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PASSED

IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, INCLUDING VARIOUS

EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER COUNTRIES, JAPAN, AND CERTAIN STATES WITHIN THE U.S. IN

THE FUTURE, THESE LAWS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING

RULES COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

THESE PRINCIPLES ARE SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION BY VARIOUS GOVERNING BODIES,

INCLUDING THE FASB AND THE SEC, WHO CREATE AND INTERPRET APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS. A CHANGE FROM CURRENT ACCOUNTING STANDARDS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB

ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE THAT ADDRESSES THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS,

SFAS NO. 123R. IN APRIL 2005, THE SEC DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF

SFAS NO. 123R TO YEARS BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2005. THEREFORE,

SFAS NO. 123R WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN ITS

FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R

WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE OF

APPROXIMATELY $0.03 FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006. ALTHOUGH THE EFFECT

FROM THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R IS EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FUTURE CHANGES TO VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS

USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR-VALUE OF AWARDS ISSUED OR THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF

EQUITY AWARDS GRANTED CREATE UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

CHANGES IN THE

COMPANYS TAX RATES COULD AFFECT ITS FUTURE RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE FAVORABLY OR UNFAVORABLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN

THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN

THE VALUATION OF THE COMPANYS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR BY

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS

SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL

REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE

LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE

THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE AFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS NET INCOME AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANYS STOCK

PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE.

THE COMPANYS STOCK HAS AT

TIMES EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY AS A RESULT OF VARIATIONS

BETWEEN ITS ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND AS A RESULT OF

ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND ITS COMPETITORS. THE STOCK MARKET HAS

EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET

PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN WAYS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN UNRELATED TO THE

OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THESE COMPANIES. THESE FACTORS, INCLUDING LACK OF

POSITIVE GENERAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS AND INVESTORS CONCERNS

REGARDING THE CREDIBILITY OF CORPORATE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND INTEGRITY OF FINANCIAL

MARKETS, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANYS

STOCK IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE MAY

RESULT IN GREATER DILUTION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE.

56

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES

ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE AND

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY REGULARLY

REVIEWS ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS AND ITS INTEREST RATE

SWAP AND OPTION POSITIONS, BOTH ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS AND IN CONJUNCTION

WITH ITS UNDERLYING FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE RELATED EXPOSURES.

HOWEVER, GIVEN THE EFFECTIVE HORIZONS OF THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES AND THE ANTICIPATORY NATURE OF THE EXPOSURES, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THE HEDGES WILL OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT

RESULTING FROM MOVEMENTS IN EITHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE OR INTEREST RATES. IN

ADDITION, THE TIMING OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR RECOGNITION OF GAINS AND LOSSES

RELATED TO MARK-TO-MARKET INSTRUMENTS FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD MAY NOT

COINCIDE WITH THE TIMING OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC

EXPOSURES AND, THEREFORE, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS

AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

INTEREST RATE RISK

WHILE THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE

FLUCTUATIONS IN MANY OF THE WORLDS LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES, THE

COMPANYS INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE IS MOST SENSITIVE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE

GENERAL LEVEL OF U.S. INTEREST RATES. IN THIS REGARD, CHANGES IN U.S. INTEREST

RATES AFFECT THE INTEREST EARNED ON THE COMPANYS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY

HEDGES.

THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT POLICY AND

STRATEGY IS TO ENSURE THE PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL, MEET LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS,

AND OPTIMIZE RETURN IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY BENCHMARKS ITS PERFORMANCE BY UTILIZING EXTERNAL MONEY

MANAGERS TO MANAGE A SMALL PORTION OF THE AGGREGATE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE

EXTERNAL MANAGERS ADHERE TO THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT POLICIES AND ALSO PROVIDE

OCCASIONAL RESEARCH AND MARKET INFORMATION THAT SUPPLEMENTS INTERNAL RESEARCH

USED TO MAKE CREDIT DECISIONS IN THE INVESTMENT PROCESS.

THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE

COMPANY PLACES ITS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES ISSUED BY

HIGH CREDIT QUALITY ISSUERS AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE COMPANYS GENERAL POLICY IS TO LIMIT THE RISK

OF PRINCIPAL LOSS AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF INVESTED FUNDS BY LIMITING MARKET

AND CREDIT RISK. ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS

OR LESS ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS; HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH

MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, APPROXIMATELY $287 MILLION OF THE

COMPANYS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES RANGING FROM 1 TO 5

YEARS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, $180 MILLION OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HAD MATURITIES RANGING FROM 1 TO

5 YEARS. THE REMAINDER ALL HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES BETWEEN 3 AND 12 MONTHS.

THE COMPANY MAY SELL ITS INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO THEIR STATED MATURITIES, DUE TO

LIQUIDITY NEEDS, IN ANTICIPATION OF CREDIT DETERIORATION, OR FOR DURATION

MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A NET LOSS BEFORE TAXES OF $137,000 IN 2005,

AND NET GAINS BEFORE TAXES OF $1 MILLION AND $21 MILLION IN 2004, AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY AS A RESULT OF SUCH SALES.

IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE

INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE

COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT THAT A CHANGE

IN INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ASSUMING

A 100 BASIS POINT PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE. BASED ON INVESTMENT

POSITIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, A HYPOTHETICAL 100 BASIS POINT

INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS ALL MATURITIES WOULD RESULT IN A $19.9

MILLION DECLINE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO. AS OF SEPTEMBER 25,

2004, A SIMILAR 100 BASIS POINT SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN

A $14.4 MILLION DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE. SUCH LOSSES WOULD ONLY BE REALIZED IF

THE COMPANY SOLD THE INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO MATURITY. EXCEPT IN INSTANCES NOTED

ABOVE, THE COMPANYS POLICY IS TO HOLD INVESTMENTS TO MATURITY.

57

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE

COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER MATCH THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE INTEREST

INCOME ON ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH ITS FIXED-RATE

INTEREST EXPENSE ON ITS DEBT, AND/OR TO DIVERSIFY A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE

AWAY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN SHORT-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY DID NOT

ENTER INTO ANY INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES DURING 2005 OR 2004 AND HAD NO OPEN

INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES AT SEPTEMBER 24, 2005.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

RISK

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY IS A NET RECEIVER OF

CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES,

AND IN PARTICULAR A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS NET SALES AND GROSS MARGINS AS EXPRESSED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THERE IS

ALSO A RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL HAVE TO ADJUST LOCAL CURRENCY PRODUCT PRICING

DUE TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WHEN THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD

AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY

COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND NET INVESTMENTS IN

FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. GENERALLY, THE COMPANYS PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY

OF ITS EXISTING MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY MAY NOT HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES DUE TO

IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES, AND

LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY

DERIVATIVE POSITIONS, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS USING A

VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN

EXCHANGE RATES. THE VAR MODEL CONSISTED OF USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TO

GENERATE 3000 RANDOM MARKET PRICE PATHS. THE VAR IS THE MAXIMUM EXPECTED LOSS IN

FAIR VALUE, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, TO THE COMPANYS FOREIGN EXCHANGE

PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN RATES. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO

REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE

MODEL ASSUMES NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM

COMMITMENTS, AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WERE

EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE MODEL, THE COMPANY

ESTIMATES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF $10.0

MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005 COMPARED TO A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS OF

$3.2 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2004. BECAUSE THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN

CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS FOR HEDGING PURPOSES, LOSSES INCURRED ON THOSE INSTRUMENTS

ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING

EXPOSURES.

ACTUAL FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY

FROM THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005 DUE TO

THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PREDICTING THE CHANGES IN THE TIMING

AND AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGES RATES, AND THE COMPANYS

ACTUAL EXPOSURES AND POSITIONS.

BASIS

OF PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION

THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY.

INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE PREPARATION OF

THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM

THOSE ESTIMATES. CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT

YEAR PRESENTATION.

TYPICALLY, THE COMPANYS

FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF SEPTEMBER. FISCAL YEARS 2005, 2004,

AND 2003 WERE EACH 52-WEEK YEARS. HOWEVER, APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS,

THE COMPANY REPORTS A 53-WEEK FISCAL YEAR TO ALIGN ITS FISCAL QUARTERS

WITH CALENDAR QUARTERS BY ADDING A WEEK TO ITS FIRST FISCAL QUARTER. THE

COMPANY WILL ADD THIS ADDITIONAL WEEK IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER OF ITS FISCAL

YEAR 2006. ALL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN IS BASED ON THE COMPANYS FISCAL

CALENDAR.

COMMON STOCK SPLIT

ON FEBRUARY 28, 2005,

THE COMPANY EFFECTED A TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF FEBRUARY 18,

2005. ALL SHARE AND PER SHARE INFORMATION HAS BEEN RETROACTIVELY ADJUSTED TO

REFLECT THE STOCK SPLIT.

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS

AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL HIGHLY LIQUID

INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE

CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS. HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES

GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THE

COMPANYS DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AND

ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE

APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND REEVALUATES AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

DESIGNATION AS OF EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE. THESE SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE, WITH THE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED AS A

COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE COST OF SECURITIES SOLD IS BASED UPON

THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR

ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND CARRIES THEM AT

FAIR VALUE. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DEFINED AS HEDGES IN SFAS 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

MUST BE ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS. IF THE DERIVATIVE IS A HEDGE,

DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE HEDGE, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WILL EITHER BE

OFFSET AGAINST THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE

NOTE 1SUMMARY

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

(CONTINUED)

HEDGED ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, OR FIRM COMMITMENTS THROUGH EARNINGS, OR RECOGNIZED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL THE HEDGED ITEM IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO

VARIABILITY IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW

HEDGES, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS REPORTED AS A

COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND

RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE

HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. TO RECEIVE HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT,

CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES TO EXPECTED

FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE

THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY AND THAT

ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS ON THE HEDGED ITEM

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT

PERIOD. THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF A DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT THAT IS DESIGNATED AS AN ECONOMIC HEDGE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION EXPOSURE OF THE NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION IS REPORTED

IN THE SAME MANNER AS A FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. FOR FORWARD

CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THE COMPANY EXCLUDES CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE RELATING TO CHANGES IN THE FORWARD CARRY COMPONENT FROM ITS

DEFINITION OF EFFECTIVENESS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THIS

COMPONENT ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE TRANSLATION AND ECONOMIC

EXPOSURE OF A NET INVESTMENT POSITION IN A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY. FOR SUCH

CONTRACTS, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE CONTRACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE SPOT EXCHANGE RATE. THE

EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DESIGNATED

AS A HEDGE OF THE NET INVESTMENT POSITION IN A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY IS REPORTED

IN THE SAME MANNER AS A FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. ANY RESIDUAL

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACT, INCLUDING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE

BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE SPOT AND FORWARD EXCHANGE RATES, ARE

RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT

THE LOWER OF COST, COMPUTED USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD, OR MARKET. IF

THE COST OF THE INVENTORIES EXCEEDS THEIR MARKET VALUE, PROVISIONS ARE MADE

CURRENTLY FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND THE MARKET VALUE. THE COMPANYS

INVENTORIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FINISHED GOODS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

PROPERTY,

PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND

EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED BY USE OF THE STRAIGHT-LINE

METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH ARE 30 YEARS FOR

BUILDINGS, UP TO 5 YEARS FOR EQUIPMENT, AND THE SHORTER OF LEASE TERMS OR 10

YEARS FOR LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES ELIGIBLE COSTS TO

ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE THAT ARE INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE

PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE. CAPITALIZED COSTS RELATED TO INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE

ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF

THE ASSETS, WHICH RANGE FROM 3 TO 5 YEARS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION

EXPENSE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WAS $141 MILLION, $126 MILLION, AND $108

MILLION DURING 2005, 2004, AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

. THE COMPANY REVIEWS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT RESULT FROM THE

ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT AND/OR NORMAL USE OF THE ASSETS. IF IT

IS DETERMINED THAT A LEGAL OBLIGATION EXISTS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY

FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT IS

INCURRED IF A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE CAN BE MADE. THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE LIABILITY IS ADDED TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSOCIATED ASSET AND THIS

ADDITIONAL CARRYING AMOUNT IS DEPRECIATED OVER THE LIFE OF THE ASSET. THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROSS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOW AND ITS PRESENT VALUE IS

ACCRETED OVER THE LIFE OF THE RELATED LEASE AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE. ALL OF THE

COMPANYS EXISTING ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH COMMITMENTS

TO RETURN PROPERTY SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES TO ORIGINAL CONDITION UPON LEASE

TERMINATION.

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTIC OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY

AND SFAS NO. 143.

LONG-LIVED

ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND

CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES, EXCLUDING GOODWILL, FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER

EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY

NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF THESE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF

ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED

TO GENERATE. IF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED

EQUALS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR

MARKET VALUE. FOR THE THREE FISCAL YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, THE

COMPANY HAD NO MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT OF ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, EXCEPT FOR THE

IMPAIRMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5 OF THESE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES SHOULD NOT BE AMORTIZED BUT RATHER BE TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR SOONER WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THEY MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY PERFORMS ITS

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS ON OR ABOUT AUGUST 30 OF EACH YEAR. THE COMPANY

DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2005,

2004, OR 2003. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED REPORTING UNITS BASED ON ITS CURRENT

REPORTING STRUCTURE. FOR PURPOSES OF TESTING GOODWILL FOR

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE COMPANY TRANSLATES THE

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS INTERNATIONAL NON-U.S. FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT THE END OF EACH

PERIOD. REVENUE AND EXPENSES FOR THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED USING RATES

THAT APPROXIMATE THOSE IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE

TRANSLATIONS ARE CREDITED OR CHARGED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCLUDED

IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE

COMPANYS FOREIGN MANUFACTURING SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN OTHER INTERNATIONAL

SUBSIDIARIES THAT USE THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REMEASURE

MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT THE END OF EACH

PERIOD, AND INVENTORIES, PROPERTY, AND NONMONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT

HISTORICAL RATES. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSLATIONS WERE INSIGNIFICANT

AND HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE

OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, PERIPHERALS, DIGITAL CONTENT, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT

CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS, INCLUDING STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) NO. 97-2,

SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION

, AS AMENDED, AND SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 104,

REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE

EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS

FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED

DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS

HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA

ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS,

FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES,

THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE

COMPANY LEGALLY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING

TRANSIT. IF AT THE OUTSET OF AN ARRANGEMENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE

ARRANGEMENT FEE IS NOT, OR IS PRESUMED TO NOT BE, FIXED OR DETERMINABLE,

REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED AS AMOUNTS BECOME DUE AND

PAYABLE.

REVENUE FROM SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS IS DEFERRED

AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE COVERAGE PERIODS. THESE CONTRACTS

TYPICALLY INCLUDE EXTENDED PHONE SUPPORT, REPAIR SERVICES, WEB-BASED SUPPORT RESOURCES,

DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, AND EXTEND THE SERVICE COVERAGE OFFERED UNDER THE COMPANYS

ONE-YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY.

THE COMPANY SELLS SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS

OBTAINED FROM OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES ITS OWN PRICING AND

RETAINS RELATED INVENTORY RISK, IS THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR IN SALES TRANSACTIONS

WITH ITS CUSTOMERS, AND ASSUMES THE CREDIT RISK FOR AMOUNTS BILLED TO ITS

CUSTOMERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF PRODUCTS

OBTAINED FROM OTHER COMPANIES AT THE GROSS AMOUNT BILLED.

67

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1SUMMARY

OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

REVENUE ON

ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS SUCH AS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND

SERVICES IS ALLOCATED TO EACH ELEMENT BASED ON THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OF EACH

ELEMENT. EACH ELEMENTS ALLOCATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN REVENUE

RECOGNITION CRITERIA FOR THAT ELEMENT HAS BEEN MET. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY

DETERMINED BY VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE), WHICH IS BASED ON THE

PRICE CHARGED WHEN EACH ELEMENT IS SOLD SEPARATELY.

IF THE COMPANY CANNOT OBJECTIVELY DETERMINE

THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY UNDELIVERED ELEMENT INCLUDED IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT

ARRANGEMENT, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL ALL ELEMENTS ARE DELIVERED AND

SERVICES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED, OR UNTIL FAIR VALUE CAN OBJECTIVELY BE DETERMINED

FOR ANY REMAINING UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS. WHEN THE FAIR VALUE OF A DELIVERED

ELEMENT HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE COMPANY USES THE RESIDUAL METHOD TO

RECOGNIZE REVENUE IF THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS

DETERMINABLE. UNDER THE RESIDUAL METHOD, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDELIVERED

ELEMENTS IS DEFERRED AND THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS

ALLOCATED TO THE DELIVERED ELEMENTS AND IS RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE.

THE COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR

ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE

PROGRAMS, INCLUDING RESELLER AND END USER REBATES, AND OTHER SALES PROGRAMS AND

VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES. THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS ACCRUED AS A

REDUCTION TO REVENUE IN THE PERIOD THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT AND

COMMITTED TO A PLAN. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR

EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE.

GENERALLY, THE COMPANY

DOES NOT OFFER SPECIFIED OR UNSPECIFIED UPGRADE RIGHTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS IN

CONNECTION WITH SOFTWARE SALES OR THE SALE OF EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT

CONTRACTS. WHEN THE COMPANY DOES OFFER SPECIFIED UPGRADE RIGHTS, THE COMPANY

DEFERS REVENUE FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SPECIFIED UPGRADE RIGHT UNTIL THE

FUTURE OBLIGATION IS FULFILLED OR WHEN THE RIGHT TO THE SPECIFIED UPGRADE

EXPIRES. ADDITIONALLY, A LIMITED NUMBER OF THE COMPANYS SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE

AVAILABLE WITH MAINTENANCE AGREEMENTS THAT GRANT CUSTOMERS RIGHTS TO

UNSPECIFIED FUTURE UPGRADES OVER THE MAINTENANCE TERM ON A WHEN AND IF

AVAILABLE BASIS. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH MAINTENANCE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY

OVER THE MAINTENANCE TERM.

ALLOWANCE

FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY RECORDS ITS ALLOWANCE

FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED UPON ITS ASSESSMENT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THE AGE OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES,

CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COMPANYS CUSTOMERS, CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND

OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO PAY.

SHIPPING COSTS

THE COMPANYS SHIPPING AND

HANDLING COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

WARRANTY EXPENSE

THE COMPANY PROVIDES

CURRENTLY FOR THE ESTIMATED COST FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PREEXISTING

WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY BASED ON ACTUAL

EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS

INCURRED. DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR

OTHERWISE MARKETED ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITALIZATION BEGINNING WHEN A PRODUCTS

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ENDING WHEN A PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE

INSTANCES, THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED SOON AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL

FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. THEREFORE, COSTS INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO

ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY ARE USUALLY NOT SIGNIFICANT, AND

GENERALLY ALL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS HAVE BEEN EXPENSED.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY BEGAN

INCURRING SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MAC OS X VERSION 10.4

TIGER SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS EVIDENCED BY

PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION IN AUGUST 2004 AND THE SUBSEQUENT RELEASE OF A

DEVELOPER BETA VERSION OF THE PRODUCT. THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED APPROXIMATELY

$29.7 AND $4.5 MILLION DURING 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY, OF COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF TIGER. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 86, AMORTIZATION

OF THIS ASSET TO COST OF SALES BEGAN IN APRIL 2005 WHEN THE COMPANY BEGAN

SHIPPING TIGER AND IS BEING RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A 3 YEAR

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE.

INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FILEMAKER PRO 7

SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS EVIDENCED BY PUBLIC

DEMONSTRATION AND RELEASE OF A DEVELOPER BETA VERSION, AND PRIOR TO THE RELEASE

OF THE FINAL VERSION OF THE PRODUCT IN MARCH 2004. THEREFORE, DURING THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED APPROXIMATELY $2.3 MILLION OF

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF FILEMAKER PRO 7. IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SFAS NO. 86, AMORTIZATION OF THIS ASSET TO COST OF SALES BEGAN IN MARCH 2004

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS EVIDENCED BY PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION AND RELEASE OF A

DEVELOPER BETA IN JUNE 2003, AND PRIOR TO RELEASE OF THE FINAL VERSION OF

THE PRODUCT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004. THEREFORE, DURING 2003 THE COMPANY

CAPITALIZED APPROXIMATELY $14.7 MILLION OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE DEVELOPMENT OF PANTHER. AMORTIZATION OF THIS ASSET BEGAN IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2004 WHEN PANTHER WAS SHIPPED AND IS BEING RECOGNIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 86 OVER A 3 YEAR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIFE.

TOTAL AMORTIZATION RELATED

TO CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS WAS $15.7 MILLION, $10.7 MILLION, AND

$5.8 MILLION IN 2005, 2004, AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY.

FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004) (SFAS NO. 123R),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

, WHICH ADDRESSES THE ACCOUNTING FOR

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH AN ENTERPRISE RECEIVES EMPLOYEE

SERVICES IN EXCHANGE FOR (A) EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF THE ENTERPRISE OR (B) LIABILITIES

THAT ARE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ENTERPRISES EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OR THAT

MAY BE SETTLED BY THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. SFAS NO. 123R

ELIMINATES THE ABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS

USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD UNDER APB OPINION NO. 25, AND REQUIRES

INSTEAD THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING A FAIR-VALUE-BASED

METHOD. IN JANUARY 2005, THE SEC ISSUED SAB NO. 107, WHICH

PROVIDES SUPPLEMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR SFAS NO. 123R. SFAS NO. 123R

WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF ITS FISCAL

2006. THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT OF THE ESTIMATED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE IS AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE AS WELL AS ASSUMPTIONS

REGARDING A NUMBER OF COMPLEX VARIABLES AND THE RELATED TAX IMPACT. THESE

VARIABLES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE,

VOLATILITY, AND EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION EXERCISE BEHAVIORS AND THE RELATED TAX

IMPACT. THE COMPANY WILL RECOGNIZE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE ON ALL

AWARDS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD USING THE

MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE METHOD. ALTHOUGH THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R IS

EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

FUTURE CHANGES TO VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR-VALUE OF

AWARDS ISSUED OR THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF EQUITY AWARDS GRANTED CREATE

UNCERTAINTY AS TO WHETHER FUTURE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE WILL BE

SIMILAR TO THE HISTORICAL SFAS NO. 123 PRO FORMA EXPENSE.

EARNINGS PER COMMON

SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY

DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER

OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EARNINGS PER

COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY

THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING

THE PERIOD INCREASED TO INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IF THE DILUTIVE POTENTIAL SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK HAD BEEN ISSUED. THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF OUTSTANDING OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK

AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IS REFLECTED IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY

APPLICATION OF THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. UNDER THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD, AN

INCREASE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK CAN RESULT IN A

GREATER DILUTIVE EFFECT FROM OUTSTANDING OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. ADDITIONALLY, THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS

AND THE VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS CAN RESULT IN A

MARKET VALUES WERE

DETERMINED FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SECURITY IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE

DECLINE IN VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES AND IS CONSIDERED TO BE TEMPORARY IN NATURE. INVESTMENTS ARE

REVIEWED PERIODICALLY TO IDENTIFY POSSIBLE IMPAIRMENT. WHEN EVALUATING THE

INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY REVIEWS FACTORS SUCH AS THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT

TO WHICH FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW COST BASIS, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE

ISSUER, AND THE COMPANYS ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A

PERIOD OF TIME WHICH MAY BE SUFFICIENT FOR ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN MARKET

VALUE.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY

RESELLERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATION, CONSUMER, AND COMMERCIAL

CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE COLLATERAL FROM ITS

CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER, WHEN POSSIBLE THE COMPANY DOES ATTEMPT TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK

ON TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CREDIT INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN LATIN

AMERICA, EUROPE, AND ASIA AND BY ARRANGING WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES

TO PROVIDE FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER LOAN AND LEASE PROGRAMS TO THE

COMPANYS DIRECT CUSTOMERS. THESE CREDIT FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY

BETWEEN THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANY AND THE END CUSTOMER. AS SUCH, THE

COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RECOURSE OR CREDIT RISK SHARING RELATED

TO ANY OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER, CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT

ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL, THIRD-PARTY FLOORING

VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY HAS NON-TRADE

RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF ITS MANUFACTURING VENDORS RESULTING FROM THE SALE

OF RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS TO THESE MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHO MANUFACTURE

SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

PURCHASES THESE RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS DIRECTLY FROM SUPPLIERS. THESE

NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN

OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, TOTALED $417 MILLION AND $276 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 24,

2005 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT REFLECT

THE SALE OF THESE COMPONENTS IN NET SALES AND DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY PROFITS ON

THESE SALES UNTIL THE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH TO THE END CUSTOMER AT WHICH

TIME THE PROFIT IS RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION OF COST OF SALES.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES TO PARTIALLY OFFSET ITS

BUSINESS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK. FOREIGN CURRENCY

FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE USED TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ON

CERTAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND TO HEDGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON CERTAIN FORECASTED REVENUE AND COST OF SALES.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE AGREEMENTS

TO MODIFY THE INTEREST RATE PROFILE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND DEBT. THE

COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE BASED ON WHETHER THE

INSTRUMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGE OR NON-HEDGE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY

RECORDS ALL DERIVATIVES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE.

THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE ONE MEASURE OF THE TRANSACTION VOLUME OUTSTANDING AS OF

YEAR-END, AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT

OR MARKET LOSS. THE CREDIT RISK AMOUNT SHOWN IN THE TABLE ABOVE REPRESENTS THE

COMPANYS GROSS EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING LOSS ON THESE TRANSACTIONS IF

ALL COUNTERPARTIES FAILED TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT,

BASED ON THEN-CURRENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AT EACH RESPECTIVE DATE.

THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS AND MARKET RISK WILL VARY OVER TIME AS A

FUNCTION OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR

VALUE ARE BASED ON APPLICABLE AND COMMONLY USED PRICING MODELS AND PREVAILING

FINANCIAL MARKET INFORMATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 25,

2004. ALTHOUGH THE TABLE ABOVE REFLECTS THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL, FAIR VALUE, AND

CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS, IT DOES NOT

REFLECT THE GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT

THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE. THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY

REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TOGETHER WITH THE

GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES, WILL DEPEND ON ACTUAL MARKET

CONDITIONS DURING THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENTS.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD

AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY

COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND NET INVESTMENTS IN

FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. GENERALLY, THE COMPANYS PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY

OF ITS EXISTING MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY MAY NOT HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES DUE TO

IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES, OR

LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

TO HELP PROTECT GROSS MARGINS FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, THE COMPANYS U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL

SUBSIDIARIES HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES, AND THE

COMPANYS NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL SUBSIDIARIES SELLING IN LOCAL CURRENCIES

HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INVENTORY PURCHASES NOT DENOMINATED IN THE

SUBSIDIARIES FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH

HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES IS RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF NET SALES

IN THE SAME

75

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 2FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS (CONTINUED)

PERIOD AS THE RELATED SALES ARE RECOGNIZED, AND OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME RELATED TO INVENTORY PURCHASES IS RECOGNIZED AS A

COMPONENT OF COST OF SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED COSTS ARE

RECOGNIZED. TYPICALLY, THE COMPANY HEDGES PORTIONS OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUES AND INVENTORY PURCHASES OVER A TIME

HORIZON OF 3 TO 6 MONTHS.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES

MUST BE DE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED HEDGED

TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN A

SUBSEQUENT 2 MONTH TIME PERIOD. DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE IMMEDIATELY

RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES

IN FAIR VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO REFLECTED IN CURRENT

EARNINGS UNLESS THEY ARE RE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF OTHER TRANSACTIONS. THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET LOSSES OF $1.6 MILLION AND $2.8 MILLION IN 2005 AND

2004, RESPECTIVELY, IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE RELATED TO THE LOSS OF HEDGE

DESIGNATION ON DISCONTINUED CASH FLOW HEDGES DUE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS

FORECAST OF FUTURE NET SALES AND COST OF SALES AND DUE TO PREVAILING MARKET

CONDITIONS. NO NET GAINS, OR LOSSES, OF A SIMILAR NATURE WERE RECORDED IN 2003.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD A NET DEFERRED GAIN ASSOCIATED

WITH CASH FLOW HEDGES OF APPROXIMATELY $3.6 MILLION, NET OF TAXES, SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS BY THE END OF THE

SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006.

THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF A

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DESIGNATED AS A NET INVESTMENT HEDGE IS INCLUDED IN THE

CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT ACCOUNT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME WITHIN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005 AND

SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD A NET GAIN OF $673,000 AND A NET LOSS

OF $1.8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENT.

THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER

INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES RECORDED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND

EXPENSE AS OFFSETS TO THE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES. DUE TO CURRENCY MARKET MOVEMENTS, CHANGES IN OPTION TIME VALUE CAN

LEAD TO INCREASED VOLATILITY IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

INTEREST RATE RISK

MANAGEMENT

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY HISTORICALLY ENTERED

INTO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER

TO BETTER MATCH THE COMPANYS FLOATING-RATE INTEREST INCOME ON ITS CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH ITS FIXED-RATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON

ANY OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM DEBT, AND/OR TO DIVERSIFY A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS

EXPOSURE AWAY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN SHORT-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES.

DURING 2001 AND 2002, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AND

THEN SUBSEQUENTLY TERMINATED VARIOUS INTEREST RATE DEBT SWAP AGREEMENTS

GENERATING A REALIZED GAIN OF $23 MILLION. THESE GAINS WERE DEFERRED AND

AMORTIZED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING DEBT, WHICH MATURED AND WAS

REPAID IN FEBRUARY 2004.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 24,

2005 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES

OUTSTANDING.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY

RECORDED AN ADJUSTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION TO GOODWILL RELATING TO A

REDUCTION OF VALUATION ALLOWANCES THAT WERE RECORDED AT THE TIME CERTAIN NET

OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS (NOLS) WERE ACQUIRED IN PREVIOUS BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THESE NOLS WERE DEEMED TO BE

MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED AND ACCORDINGLY THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES

WERE REVERSED AGAINST THE RELATED GOODWILL THAT WAS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF

THE ACQUISITIONS.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED

AN ADJUSTMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION TO GOODWILL RELATED TO THE

ACQUISITION OF POWERSCHOOL, INC. (POWERSCHOOL) IN 2001. THIS REDUCTION OF

GOODWILL INCLUDED THE CANCELLATION OF 158,334 SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK,

VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION, THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY HELD IN ESCROW

AND WERE REFUNDED UPON RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN MATTERS ARISING OUT OF THE

ACQUISITION OF POWERSCHOOL. THIS ADJUSTMENT ALSO INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $3

FOREIGN PRETAX EARNINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $922 MILLION, $384 MILLION, AND $250

MILLION IN 2005, 2004, AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005,

APPROXIMATELY $4.3 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS WERE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ARE GENERALLY BASED IN U.S.

DOLLAR-DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. AMOUNTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE

GENERALLY SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXATION ON REPATRIATION TO THE U.S. THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FULLY PROVIDE FOR ANY RELATED TAX

LIABILITY ON AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE REPATRIATED, ASIDE FROM UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS

OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO BE

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE

NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF $1.2 BILLION OF SUCH EARNINGS. IT IS

NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED IF

THESE EARNINGS WERE TO BE DISTRIBUTED.

NOTE 6INCOME

TAXES

(CONTINUED)

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004, THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION

ACT (AJCA) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE AJCA INCLUDES A PROVISION FOR THE DEDUCTION

OF 85% OF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT ARE REPATRIATED, AS DEFINED IN THE

AJCA. THE LEGISLATION PROVIDED THE COMPANY WITH THE OPTION TO APPLY THIS

PROVISION TO REPATRIATIONS OF QUALIFYING EARNINGS IN EITHER 2005 OR 2006. THE

COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO EVALUATE THE EFFECTS OF THE REPATRIATION PROVISION AND

EXPECTS TO COMPLETE THE EVALUATION IN 2006. A MAXIMUM OF $755 MILLION MAY BE

ELIGIBLE FOR REPATRIATION UNDER THE REDUCED TAX RATE PROVIDED BY AJCA. HOWEVER,

GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES AND COMPLEXITIES OF THE REPATRIATION PROVISION AND THE

COMPANYS CONTINUING EVALUATION, THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET DETERMINED THE AMOUNT

THAT MAY BE REPATRIATED OR THE RELATED POTENTIAL INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF SUCH

REPATRIATION.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECT THE

EFFECTS OF TAX LOSSES, CREDITS, AND THE FUTURE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF

EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES AND ARE MEASURED

USING ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH

THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED.

CARRYFORWARDS WAS ACQUIRED FROM THE COMPANYS PREVIOUS ACQUISITIONS, THE

UTILIZATION OF WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE INTERNAL

REVENUE CODE. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS FEDERAL CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS AND VARIOUS

STATE AND FOREIGN TAX LOSS AND CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, THE TAX EFFECT OF WHICH IS

APPROXIMATELY $206 MILLION AND WHICH EXPIRE BETWEEN 2010 AND 2025. THE

REMAINING BENEFITS FROM TAX LOSSES AND CREDITS DO NOT EXPIRE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24,

2005 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $5 MILLION AND $30

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WAS RECORDED AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR THE

BENEFITS OF TAX LOSSES THAT MAY NOT BE REALIZED. THE REMAINING VALUATION

ALLOWANCE RELATES PRINCIPALLY TO THE STATE OPERATING LOSSES. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME

THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER

WITH THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO

FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.

DURING 2005, THE COMPANY REVERSED CERTAIN TAX

CONTINGENCY RESERVES AND RECORDED A CORRESPONDING BENEFIT TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE

PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED OUTCOME OF CERTAIN TAX

DISPUTES. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED

A BENEFIT TO TAX EXPENSE TO ADJUST ITS NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AS A RESULT OF

THE COMPANYS YEAR-END REVIEW OF ITS DEFERRED TAX ACCOUNTS, THE IMPACT OF WHICH

WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CURRENT OR PRIOR PERIODS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE

TOTAL BENEFIT TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE FROM THE REVERSAL OF THESE TAX CONTINGENCY

RESERVES AND ADJUSTMENTS TO NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WAS $67 MILLION. THE

COMPANY ALSO RECORDED A $14 MILLION CREDIT TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE RESULTING FROM

A REDUCTION OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

THE INTERNAL REVENUE

SERVICE (IRS) HAS COMPLETED ITS FIELD AUDIT OF THE COMPANYS FEDERAL INCOME TAX

RETURNS FOR ALL YEARS PRIOR TO 2002 AND PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. CERTAIN

OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS ARE BEING CONTESTED THROUGH THE IRS APPEALS OFFICE. SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL IRS AUDIT ISSUES FOR THESE YEARS HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS

THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS

CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANYS

TAX AUDITS BE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS

EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME

TAX IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

DURING 2005 AND 2004, THE

COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED THE GRANT OF 230,000 AND 5.03 MILLION

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, RESPECTIVELY, TO MEMBERS OF THE COMPANYS SENIOR

MANAGEMENT TEAM, EXCLUDING ITS CEO. THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GENERALLY VEST

OVER FOUR YEARS EITHER IN TWO EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ON THE SECOND AND FOURTH

ANNIVERSARIES OF THE DATE OF GRANT OR IN EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ON EACH OF THE

FIRST THROUGH FOURTH ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT DATE. UPON VESTING, THE

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS WILL CONVERT INTO AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK. THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED $10.3 MILLION AND $64.4 MILLION IN 2005

AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY, IN VALUE FOR THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AS A COMPONENT

OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND IS AMORTIZING THE AMOUNTS ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS

OVER THE FOUR-YEAR REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS WAS BASED ON THE CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON

THE DATE OF GRANT. THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE

CALCULATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE UTILIZING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD.

CEO RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD

ON MARCH 19, 2003, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN

OPTION CANCELLATION AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD AGREEMENT (THE AGREEMENT) WITH MR. STEVEN

P. JOBS, ITS CEO. THE AGREEMENT CANCELLED STOCK OPTION AWARDS FOR THE PURCHASE

OF 55 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK PREVIOUSLY GRANTED TO MR. JOBS

IN 2000 AND 2001. MR. JOBS RETAINED OPTIONS TO PURCHASE 120,000 SHARES OF

THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK GRANTED IN AUGUST OF 1997 IN HIS CAPACITY AS A

MEMBER OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, PRIOR TO BECOMING THE COMPANYS CEO.

THE AGREEMENT REPLACED THE CANCELLED OPTIONS WITH A RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD OF 10

MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK. THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD

GENERALLY VESTS THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. VESTING OF SOME OR ALL OF

THE RESTRICTED SHARES WILL BE ACCELERATED IN THE EVENT MR. JOBS IS

TERMINATED WITHOUT CAUSE, DIES, OR HAS HIS MANAGEMENT ROLE REDUCED FOLLOWING A

CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY DETERMINED THE

VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD IN ACCORDANCE WITH APB OPINION NO. 25

AND HAS RECORDED THE VALUE AS DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION AS A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY AND IS AMORTIZING THAT AMOUNT ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE 3 YEAR

SERVICE PERIOD. THE VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD WAS BASED ON THE

CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE AWARD.

THE 10 MILLION RESTRICTED SHARES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CALCULATION OF

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE UTILIZING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD.

STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN

IN JULY 1999, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

AUTHORIZED A PLAN FOR THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE UP TO $500 MILLION OF ITS

COMMON STOCK. THIS REPURCHASE PLAN DOES NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY

SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES OR ACQUIRE SHARES OVER ANY SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2001, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE

3.1 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN SEPTEMBER OF 2003 AT AN

AVERAGE PRICE OF $8.32 PER SHARE FOR A TOTAL COST OF $25.5 MILLION. IN AUGUST 2003,

THE COMPANY SETTLED THIS AGREEMENT PRIOR TO ITS MATURITY, AT WHICH TIME THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $11.41. OTHER THAN THIS FORWARD

PURCHASE TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENGAGED IN ANY TRANSACTIONS TO

REPURCHASE ITS COMMON STOCK SINCE 2000. SINCE INCEPTION OF THE STOCK REPURCHASE

PLAN, THE COMPANY HAD REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 13.1 MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF

$217 MILLION. THE COMPANY WAS AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $283

MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005.

PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE

INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS

AND/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN

INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY

SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST

ITSELF OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY AND, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, DOES

NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO UNRESOLVED INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS

SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS

FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY

DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT COSTS AS OF EITHER SEPTEMBER 24,

2005 OR SEPTEMBER 25, 2004.

CONCENTRATIONS IN

THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCT

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS

ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE

SOURCES, OTHER KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND APPLICATION-SPECIFIC

INTEGRATED CIRCUITS (ASICS)) ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM

SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME OTHER KEY COMPONENTS, WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE

TO THE COMPANY FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE

AVAILABILITY AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES SOME

COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY,

AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM

COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED

WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IF

THE SUPPLY OF A KEY SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT TO THE COMPANY WERE TO BE

DELAYED OR CURTAILED, OR IN THE EVENT A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYS

SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO SHIP

RELATED PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE

COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE

PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE

COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS. FINALLY, SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE COMPANYS CPUS,

LOGIC BOARDS, AND ASSEMBLED PRODUCTS ARE NOW MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING

PARTNERS, PRIMARILY IN VARIOUS PARTS OF ASIA. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WORKS

CLOSELY WITH ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ON MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES, THE COMPANYS

OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS WERE

UNABLE TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION OBLIGATIONS.

LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS

SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 24,

2005, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS WITH HYNIX

SEMICONDUCTOR, INC., INTEL CORPORATION, MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC.,

SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION TO SECURE SUPPLY OF NAND

FLASH MEMORY THROUGH CALENDAR YEAR 2010. AS PART OF THESE AGREEMENTS, THE

COMPANY INTENDS TO PREPAY A TOTAL OF $1.25 BILLION FOR FLASH MEMORY COMPONENTS

BY THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006.

CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF BUSINESS AND HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY ADJUDICATED. IN THE OPINION OF

MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY

CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE

AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY,

OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE

PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THESE

LEGAL MATTERS OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR

REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PRODUCTION AND MARKETING

OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE

REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO RETURN PRODUCT AT THE END OF

ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR

RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PASSED

IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES INCLUDING VARIOUS

EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER COUNTRIES, JAPAN AND CERTAIN STATES WITHIN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH

THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE

BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO

ASSURANCE THAT

91

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 10COMMITMENTS

AND CONTINGENCIES (CONTINUED)

SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR

FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

NOTE 11SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 131,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION

,

THE COMPANY REPORTS SEGMENT INFORMATION BASED ON THE MANAGEMENT APPROACH. THE

MANAGEMENT APPROACH DESIGNATES THE INTERNAL REPORTING USED BY MANAGEMENT FOR

MAKING DECISIONS AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE AS THE SOURCE OF THE COMPANYS

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A

GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE COMPRISED OF

THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND RETAIL. THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, AND JAPAN

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT. THE

AMERICAS SEGMENT INCLUDES BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA. THE EUROPE SEGMENT

INCLUDES EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. THE RETAIL

SEGMENT OPERATES APPLE-OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S., CANADA, JAPAN, AND THE

U.K. OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS INCLUDE ASIA-PACIFIC, WHICH INCLUDES AUSTRALIA

AND ASIA EXCEPT FOR JAPAN, AND THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY, FILEMAKER, INC. EACH

REPORTABLE GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT PROVIDES SIMILAR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE

PRODUCTS AND SIMILAR SERVICES, AND THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE VARIOUS

SEGMENTS ARE THE SAME AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED BELOW FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT.

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING

SEGMENTS BASED ON NET SALES. THE RETAIL SEGMENTS PERFORMANCE IS ALSO EVALUATED

BASED ON OPERATING INCOME. NET SALES FOR GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS ARE GENERALLY

BASED ON THE LOCATION OF THE CUSTOMERS. OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT

INCLUDES NET SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, RELATED COST OF SALES, AND OPERATING

EXPENSES DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SEGMENT. OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH

SEGMENT EXCLUDES OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AND CERTAIN EXPENSES THAT ARE MANAGED

OUTSIDE THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. COSTS EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

INCLUDE VARIOUS CORPORATE EXPENSES, MANUFACTURING COSTS AND VARIANCES NOT

INCLUDED IN STANDARD COSTS, INCOME TAXES, AND VARIOUS NONRECURRING CHARGES.

CORPORATE EXPENSES INCLUDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CORPORATE MARKETING

EXPENSES, MANUFACTURING COSTS AND VARIANCES NOT INCLUDED IN STANDARD COSTS, AND

OTHER SEPARATELY MANAGED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCLUDING CERTAIN

CORPORATE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPORT OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT INCLUDE INTERCOMPANY TRANSFERS BETWEEN SEGMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT

REPORTING PURPOSES. SEGMENT ASSETS EXCLUDE CORPORATE ASSETS. CORPORATE ASSETS

INCLUDE CASH, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS, MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, MISCELLANEOUS

CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE, GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND

RETAIL STORE CONSTRUCTION-IN-PROGRESS THAT IS NOT SUBJECT TO DEPRECIATION.

EXCEPT FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE

NOT REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT BY SEGMENT. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY THE RETAIL

SEGMENT WERE $132 MILLION, $104 MILLION, AND $92 MILLION FOR 2005, 2004, AND

2003 RESPECTIVELY.

OPERATING INCOME FOR ALL SEGMENTS, EXCEPT RETAIL,

INCLUDES COST OF SALES AT MANUFACTURING STANDARD COST, OTHER COST OF SALES,

RELATED SALES AND MARKETING COSTS, AND CERTAIN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

COSTS. THIS MEASURE OF OPERATING INCOME, WHICH INCLUDES MANUFACTURING PROFIT,

PROVIDES A COMPARABLE BASIS FOR COMPARISON BETWEEN THE COMPANYS VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC

SEGMENTS. CERTAIN MANUFACTURING EXPENSES AND RELATED ADJUSTMENTS NOT INCLUDED

IN SEGMENT COST OF SALES, INCLUDING VARIANCES BETWEEN STANDARD AND ACTUAL

MANUFACTURING COSTS AND THE MARK-UP ABOVE STANDARD COST FOR PRODUCT SUPPLIED TO

THE RETAIL SEGMENT, ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE EXPENSES.

92

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 11SEGMENT

INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

(CONTINUED)

MANAGEMENT ASSESSES THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE

RETAIL SEGMENT DIFFERENTLY THAN IT ASSESSES THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE

COMPANYS GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS. THE RETAIL SEGMENT REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME

IS INTENDED TO DEPICT A MEASURE COMPARABLE TO THAT OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR

CHANNEL PARTNERS IN THE U.S. OPERATING RETAIL STORES SO THE COMPANY CAN

EVALUATE THE RETAIL SEGMENT PERFORMANCE AS IF IT WERE A CHANNEL PARTNER.

THEREFORE, THE COMPANY MAKES THREE SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE RETAIL

SEGMENT FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE RESULTS

OF THE COMPANYS OTHER SEGMENTS.

FIRST, THE RETAIL SEGMENTS OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES

COST OF SALES FOR APPLE PRODUCTS AT AN AMOUNT NORMALLY CHARGED TO MAJOR CHANNEL

PARTNERS IN THE U.S. OPERATING RETAIL STORES, LESS THE COST OF SALES PROGRAMS

AND INCENTIVES PROVIDED TO THOSE CHANNEL PARTNERS AND THE COMPANYS COST TO

SUPPORT THOSE PARTNERS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, SEPTEMBER 25,

2004, AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THIS RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF

ADDITIONAL COST OF SALES ABOVE STANDARD COST BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT AND AN

OFFSETTING BENEFIT TO CORPORATE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $435 MILLION, $213

MILLION, AND $106 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

SECOND, THE COMPANYS SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS

ARE TRANSFERRED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT AT THE SAME COST AS THAT CHARGED TO THE

COMPANYS MAJOR RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS IN THE U.S., RESULTING IN A MEASURE OF

REVENUE AND GROSS MARGIN FOR THOSE ITEMS THAT IS COMPARABLE BETWEEN THE COMPANYS

RETAIL STORES AND THOSE RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS. THE RETAIL SEGMENT RECOGNIZES

THE FULL AMOUNT OF REVENUE AND COST OF SALES OF THE COMPANYS SERVICE AND

SUPPORT CONTRACTS AT THE TIME OF SALE. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET EARNED

THE REVENUE OR INCURRED THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF THESE CONTRACTS,

AN OFFSET TO THESE AMOUNTS IS RECOGNIZED IN OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS NET SALES

AND COST OF SALES. FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, THIS RESULTED IN

THE RECOGNITION OF NET SALES AND COST OF SALES BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT, WITH

CORRESPONDING OFFSETS IN OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS, OF $92 MILLION AND $64

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, THE NET

SALES AND COST OF SALES RECOGNIZED BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT FOR SALES OF SERVICE

AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS WERE $54 MILLION AND $37 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOR THE

YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2003, THIS RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF NET

SALES AND COST OF SALES BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT OF $30 MILLION AND $20 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

THIRD, THE COMPANY HAS OPENED SEVEN HIGH PROFILE

STORES IN NEW YORK, LOS ANGELES, CHICAGO, SAN FRANCISCO, TOKYO, JAPAN, OSAKA,

JAPAN, AND LONDON, ENGLAND AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005. THESE HIGH PROFILE

STORES ARE LARGER THAN THE COMPANYS TYPICAL RETAIL STORES AND WERE DESIGNED TO

FURTHER PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND PROVIDE A VENUE FOR CERTAIN CORPORATE SALES

AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING CORPORATE BRIEFINGS. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY

ALLOCATES CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THESE STORES TO CORPORATE

MARKETING EXPENSE TO REFLECT THE ESTIMATED BENEFIT REALIZED COMPANY-WIDE. THE

ALLOCATION OF THESE OPERATING COSTS IS BASED ON THE AMOUNT INCURRED FOR A HIGH

PROFILE STORE IN EXCESS OF THAT INCURRED BY A MORE TYPICAL COMPANY RETAIL

LOCATION. EXPENSES ALLOCATED TO CORPORATE MARKETING RESULTING FROM THE

OPERATIONS OF THESE STORES WERE $31 MILLION, $16 MILLION, AND $6 MILLION FOR

THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, AND SEPTEMBER 27,

2003, RESPECTIVELY.

APPLE COMPUTER, INC..

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS OF APPLE COMPUTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF SEPTEMBER 24,

2005 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 2004, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE

THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2005. THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF

MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE

SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL

POSITION OF THE COMPANY AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 25,

2004, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE

YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, IN CONFORMITY

WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS

REPORT

OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS

APPLE COMPUTER, INC..

WE HAVE AUDITED MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN

THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING, THAT APPLE COMPUTER, INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, BASED

ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). APPLE COMPUTER, INC.S

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION

ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND AN OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF APPLE

COMPUTER, INC.S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE

STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE

CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY

OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN

REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE

ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE

COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR

TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS

OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK

THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT THAT APPLE

COMPUTER, INC. MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS,

BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY COSO. ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, APPLE

COMPUTER, INC. MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL-INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED

BY COSO.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD

(UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF APPLE COMPUTER, INC. AS OF SEPTEMBER 24,

ACT) WERE EFFECTIVE AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005 TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION

REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY THE COMPANY IN REPORTS THAT IT FILES OR SUBMITS

UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS (I) RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED

WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULES AND

FORMS AND (II) ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT,

INCLUDING ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS

APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

INHERENT

LIMITATIONS OVER INTERNAL CONTROLS

THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION

OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT.

(I)    PERTAIN TO

THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS;

(II)   PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT THE COMPANYS RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE

BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT

AND DIRECTORS; AND

(III)  PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE

COMPANYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROLS WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS AND ALL

FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE

ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CONTROL

SYSTEM ARE MET. FURTHER, THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT

THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE

CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL

CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE

ASSURANCE THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN

DETECTED. ALSO, ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS IN FUTURE

PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THOSE INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE

BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN BUSINESS CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT

IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F) UNDER THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED). MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN

EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING BASED ON THE CRITERIA SET FORTH IN INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION (COSO). BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

100

EFFECTIVE AS OF SEPTEMBER 24,

2005. THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, KPMG LLP,

HAS ISSUED AN ATTESTATION REPORT ON THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT OF ITS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING APPEARS ON PAGE 99 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IDENTIFIED

IN MANAGEMENTS EVALUATION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005 THAT HAVE

MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION

THE FORM AND AMOUNT OF

DIRECTOR COMPENSATION IS DETERMINED BY THE BOARD AFTER A REVIEW OF

RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE NOMINATING COMMITTEE. THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF THE

BOARD IS TO BASE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF A DIRECTORS ANNUAL RETAINER ON

EQUITY. IN 1998, SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED THE 1997 DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN (THE



DIRECTOR PLAN

) AND 1,600,000 SHARES WERE

RESERVED FOR ISSUANCE THEREUNDER. PURSUANT TO THE DIRECTOR PLAN, THE COMPANYS

NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS ARE GRANTED AN OPTION TO ACQUIRE 30,000 SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK UPON THEIR INITIAL ELECTION TO THE BOARD (

INITIAL

OPTIONS

). THE INITIAL OPTIONS VEST AND BECOME EXERCISABLE IN THREE

EQUAL ANNUAL INSTALLMENTS ON EACH OF THE FIRST THROUGH THIRD ANNIVERSARIES OF

THE GRANT DATE. ON THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF A NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS INITIAL

ELECTION TO THE BOARD AND ON EACH SUBSEQUENT ANNIVERSARY THEREAFTER, THE

DIRECTOR WILL BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE AN OPTION TO ACQUIRE 10,000 SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK (

ANNUAL OPTIONS

). ANNUAL OPTIONS

ARE FULLY VESTED AND IMMEDIATELY EXERCISABLE ON THEIR DATE OF GRANT. AS OF THE

END OF THE FISCAL YEAR, THERE WERE OPTIONS FOR 740,000 SHARES OUTSTANDING UNDER

THE DIRECTOR PLAN. SINCE ACCEPTING THE POSITION OF CEO, MR. JOBS IS NO

LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR GRANTS UNDER THE DIRECTOR PLAN. NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS ALSO

RECEIVE A $50,000 ANNUAL RETAINER PAID IN QUARTERLY INCREMENTS. IN ADDITION,

DIRECTORS RECEIVE UP TO TWO FREE COMPUTER SYSTEMS PER YEAR AND ARE ELIGIBLE TO

PURCHASE ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AT A DISCOUNT. DIRECTORS DO NOT RECEIVE ANY

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION FOR SERVING ON COMMITTEES OR AS COMMITTEE CHAIRPERSON.

THE CURRENT MEMBERS OF THE

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ARE MESSRS. CAMPBELL, DREXLER AND GORE, NONE OF

WHOM ARE EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY AND ALL OF WHOM ARE CONSIDERED INDEPENDENT

BOARD OR COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AND ANY MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF THE DIRECTORS OR

ALL OUTSTANDING OPTIONS UNDER THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTION PLANS, EXCEPT THE

DIRECTOR PLAN, WILL, UNLESS OTHERWISE DETERMINED BY THE PLAN ADMINISTRATOR,

BECOME FULLY EXERCISABLE, AND WILL BE CASHED OUT AT AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE APPLICABLE CHANGE IN CONTROL PRICE AND THE EXERCISE

PRICE. THE DIRECTOR PLAN PROVIDES THAT UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY,

ALL OUTSTANDING OPTIONS HELD BY NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS WILL AUTOMATICALLY

BECOME FULLY EXERCISABLE AND WILL BE CASHED OUT AT AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE APPLICABLE CHANGE IN CONTROL PRICE AND THE EXERCISE

COMBINED VOTING POWER OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING SECURITIES OR (II) THE

OCCURRENCE OF A TRANSACTION REQUIRING SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL AND INVOLVING THE

SALE OF ALL OR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY OR THE MERGER OF

THE COMPANY WITH OR INTO ANOTHER CORPORATION.

RESTRICTED STOCK GRANTS, AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED TO THE NAMED

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS GENERALLY PROVIDE THAT IN THE EVENT THERE IS A CHANGE IN

CONTROL, AS DEFINED IN THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTION PLANS, AND IF IN CONNECTION

WITH OR FOLLOWING SUCH CHANGE IN CONTROL, THEIR EMPLOYMENT IS TERMINATED

WITHOUT CAUSE OR IF THEY SHOULD RESIGN FOR GOOD REASON, THOSE OPTIONS,

RESTRICTED STOCK, AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS OUTSTANDING THAT ARE NOT YET

VESTED AS OF THE DATE OF SUCH CHANGE IN CONTROL SHALL BECOME FULLY VESTED.

FURTHER, RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE

TO PERFORM HIS OR HER EMPLOYMENT DUTIES. GOOD REASON INCLUDES RESIGNATION OF

EMPLOYMENT AS A RESULT OF A SUBSTANTIAL DIMINUTION IN POSITION OR DUTIES, OR AN

POLICY

ON AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES PERFORMED BY

THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

PRIOR TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE SARBANES-OXLEY ACT

OF 2002 (THE 

ACT

), THE COMPANY ADOPTED AN

AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE POLICY THAT BANNED ITS AUDITORS FROM PERFORMING NON-FINANCIAL

CONSULTING SERVICES, SUCH AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONSULTING AND INTERNAL

AUDIT SERVICES. THIS AUDITOR POLICY ALSO MANDATES THAT THE AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT

SERVICES AND RELATED BUDGET BE APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE IN ADVANCE, AND

THAT THE AUDIT COMMITTEE BE PROVIDED WITH QUARTERLY REPORTING ON ACTUAL

SPENDING. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS POLICY, ALL SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED BY KPMG

WERE PRE-APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.

SUBSEQUENT TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE ACT, THE AUDIT

COMMITTEE MET WITH KPMG TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND THE PROVISIONS OF THAT ACT AS IT

RELATES TO AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE. KPMG ROTATED THE LEAD AUDIT PARTNER FOR FISCAL

YEAR 2005 AND WILL ROTATE OTHER PARTNERS AS APPROPRIATE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE

ACT. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY

KPMG TO COMPLY WITH THE ACT.
