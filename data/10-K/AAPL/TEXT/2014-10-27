COMPETITORS AND PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANYS DIGITAL CONTENT SERVICES HAVE FACED SIGNIFICANT

COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMPANIES PROMOTING THEIR OWN DIGITAL MUSIC AND CONTENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING THOSE OFFERING FREE PEER-TO-PEER MUSIC AND VIDEO SERVICES.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND OFFER NEW INNOVATIVE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN EACH OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH IT COMPETES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT OFFERS SUPERIOR INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION OF THE ENTIRE SOLUTION INCLUDING THE HARDWARE (IPHONE, IPAD, MAC AND IPOD), SOFTWARE (IOS, OS X AND ITUNES), ONLINE

SERVICES AND DISTRIBUTION OF DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS (ITUNES STORE, APP STORE, IBOOKS STORE AND MAC APP STORE). SOME OF THE COMPANYS CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO PROFIT OR EVEN AT A LOSS TO COMPETE WITH THE COMPANYS OFFERINGS.

SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS ARE CURRENTLY

OBTAINED FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY COMPETES FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE MARKETS FOR MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS. THEREFORE, MANY COMPONENTS USED BY THE

COMPANY, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE SHORTAGE AND SIGNIFICANT PRICING FLUCTUATIONS THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING

RESULTS.

THE COMPANY USES SOME CUSTOM COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMONLY USED BY ITS COMPETITORS, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN

UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE. WHEN A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT USES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL THE SUPPLIERS YIELDS HAVE MATURED OR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY HAS INCREASED. IF THE

COMPANYS SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS FOR A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT WERE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED, OR IF AN OUTSOURCING PARTNER DELAYED SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN

SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES, OR AT ALL, MAY BE AFFECTED IF THOSE SUPPLIERS CONCENTRATED ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO

MEET THE COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS.

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF MANY COMPONENTS; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE

THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO EXTEND OR RENEW THESE AGREEMENTS ON SIMILAR TERMS, OR AT ALL. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF SUPPLY SHORTAGES AND PRICE INCREASES THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHILE THE COMPANY MANUFACTURES SOME MACS IN THE UNITED STATES, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS

HARDWARE PRODUCTS ARE CURRENTLY MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS THAT ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN ASIA. A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF THIS MANUFACTURING IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY A SMALL NUMBER OF OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, OFTEN IN SINGLE LOCATIONS.

CERTAIN OF THESE OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ARE THE SOLE-SOURCED SUPPLIERS OF COMPONENTS AND MANUFACTURERS FOR MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WORKS CLOSELY WITH ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ON MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES, THE

COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS WERE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION COMMITMENTS. THE COMPANYS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

BECAUSE THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE

COMPANY COMPETES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY DEPENDS HEAVILY UPON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUAL AND TIMELY FLOW OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE

MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS AND TO EXPAND THE RANGE OF ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS THROUGH R&D, LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND ACQUISITION OF THIRD-PARTY BUSINESSES AND

TECHNOLOGY. TOTAL R&D EXPENSE WAS $6.0 BILLION, $4.5 BILLION AND $3.4 BILLION IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND

LICENSES

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS RIGHTS TO PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS RELATING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS HARDWARE DEVICES, ACCESSORIES, SOFTWARE

AND SERVICES. THE COMPANY HAS REGISTERED OR HAS APPLIED FOR TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IN THE U.S. AND A NUMBER OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE OWNERSHIP OF SUCH PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IS AN

IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ITS BUSINESS AND THAT ITS SUCCESS DOES DEPEND IN PART ON THE OWNERSHIP THEREOF, THE COMPANY RELIES PRIMARILY ON THE INNOVATIVE SKILLS, TECHNICAL COMPETENCE AND MARKETING ABILITIES OF ITS PERSONNEL.

THE COMPANY REGULARLY FILES PATENT APPLICATIONS TO PROTECT INNOVATIONS ARISING FROM ITS RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND DESIGN, AND IS CURRENTLY PURSUING

THOUSANDS OF PATENT APPLICATIONS AROUND THE WORLD. OVER TIME, THE COMPANY HAS ACCUMULATED A LARGE PORTFOLIO OF ISSUED PATENTS AROUND THE WORLD. THE COMPANY HOLDS COPYRIGHTS RELATING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. NO

SINGLE PATENT OR COPYRIGHT IS SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR PROTECTING THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE DURATION OF ITS PATENTS IS ADEQUATE RELATIVE TO THE EXPECTED LIVES OF ITS PRODUCTS.

MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES. IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK

OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS, PROCESSES AND SERVICES. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS GENERALLY BEEN ABLE TO OBTAIN SUCH LICENSES ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS IN THE PAST, THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT SUCH LICENSES COULD BE

OBTAINED IN THE FUTURE ON REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES, CURRENT EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN

COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, PROCESSES AND SERVICES MAY UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE EXISTING PATENTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS OR

OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.

FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

DURING 2014, THE COMPANYS DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL NET SALES ACCOUNTED FOR 38% AND 62%, RESPECTIVELY, OF TOTAL NET

SALES. INFORMATION REGARDING FINANCIAL DATA BY GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT IS SET FORTH IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE SUBHEADING SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE, AND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

10-K

IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTE 11, SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA.

WHILE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS ARE CURRENTLY MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS THAT ARE LOCATED PRIMARILY IN ASIA,

THE COMPANY ALSO PERFORMS FINAL ASSEMBLY OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS AT ITS MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN IRELAND. THE SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURE OF A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS IS PERFORMED BY SOLE-SOURCED OUTSOURCING PARTNERS IN THE U.S., ASIA AND EUROPE. MARGINS ON

SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES. INFORMATION REGARDING CONCENTRATION IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCTS IS SET FORTH IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BUSINESS SEASONALITY AND PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS

THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED HIGHER NET SALES IN ITS FIRST QUARTER COMPARED TO OTHER QUARTERS IN ITS FISCAL YEAR DUE IN PART TO SEASONAL

HOLIDAY DEMAND. ADDITIONALLY, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT NET SALES, PRODUCT COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES. PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS CAN ALSO IMPACT THE COMPANYS NET SALES TO ITS INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AS THESE

CHANNELS ARE FILLED WITH NEW PRODUCT INVENTORY FOLLOWING A PRODUCT INTRODUCTION, AND OFTEN, CHANNEL INVENTORY OF A PARTICULAR PRODUCT DECLINES AS THE NEXT RELATED MAJOR PRODUCT LAUNCH APPROACHES. NET SALES CAN ALSO BE AFFECTED WHEN CONSUMERS AND

DISTRIBUTORS ANTICIPATE A PRODUCT INTRODUCTION. HOWEVER, NEITHER HISTORICAL SEASONAL PATTERNS NOR HISTORICAL PATTERNS OF PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED RELIABLE INDICATORS OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE PATTERN OF PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS,

FUTURE NET SALES OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WARRANTY

THE

COMPANY OFFERS A LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY ON MOST OF ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE BASIC WARRANTY PERIOD IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE BY THE ORIGINAL END-USER. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A

90-DAY

BASIC WARRANTY FOR ITS SERVICE PARTS USED TO REPAIR THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS, LOCAL LAW REQUIRES THAT MANUFACTURERS GUARANTEE THEIR PRODUCTS FOR A PERIOD PRESCRIBED

BY STATUTE, TYPICALLY AT LEAST TWO YEARS. IN ADDITION, WHERE AVAILABLE, CONSUMERS MAY PURCHASE APP OR AC+, WHICH EXTENDS SERVICE COVERAGE ON MANY OF THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS.

BACKLOG

IN THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF

PRODUCT BACKLOG AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME IS NOT A MEANINGFUL INDICATION OF ITS FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS. IN PARTICULAR, BACKLOG OFTEN INCREASES IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AS CUSTOMERS ANTICIPATE SHORTAGES. BACKLOG IS OFTEN

REDUCED ONCE CUSTOMERS BELIEVE THEY CAN OBTAIN SUFFICIENT SUPPLY. BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING, BACKLOG SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMPANY HAD

APPROXIMATELY 92,600 FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES AND AN ADDITIONAL 4,400 FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS. APPROXIMATELY 46,200 OF THE TOTAL FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES WORKED IN THE COMPANYS RETAIL SEGMENT.

RISK FACTORS

THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION OF RISK FACTORS CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE

RISK FACTORS MAY BE IMPORTANT TO UNDERSTANDING ANY STATEMENT IN THIS FORM 10-K OR ELSEWHERE. THE FOLLOWING INFORMATION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH PART II, ITEM 7, MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED NOTES IN PART II, ITEM 8, FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA OF THIS FORM 10-K.

THE BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS OF THE COMPANY CAN BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS, WHETHER CURRENTLY KNOWN OR UNKNOWN,

INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW. ANY ONE OR MORE OF SUCH FACTORS COULD DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY CAUSE THE COMPANYS ACTUAL RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM PAST OR ANTICIPATED FUTURE RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ANY OF THESE FACTORS, IN WHOLE OR IN PART, COULD MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND STOCK PRICE.

BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, PAST FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT USE HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

GLOBAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON GLOBAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT GLOBAL AND REGIONAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS POSES A RISK AS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES MAY POSTPONE SPENDING IN RESPONSE TO TIGHTER CREDIT, HIGHER UNEMPLOYMENT, FINANCIAL MARKET VOLATILITY, GOVERNMENT AUSTERITY PROGRAMS, NEGATIVE FINANCIAL NEWS, DECLINES IN INCOME OR

ASSET VALUES AND/OR OTHER FACTORS. THESE WORLDWIDE AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. DEMAND ALSO COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANYS EXPECTATIONS

AS A RESULT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS BECAUSE THE COMPANY GENERALLY RAISES PRICES ON GOODS AND SERVICES SOLD OUTSIDE THE U.S. TO CORRESPOND WITH THE EFFECT OF A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD INFLUENCE WORLDWIDE OR

REGIONAL DEMAND INCLUDE INCREASES IN FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, CONDITIONS IN THE REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE MARKETS, UNEMPLOYMENT, LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, ACCESS TO CREDIT, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE AND OTHER MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECTING CONSUMER

SPENDING BEHAVIOR. THESE AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

IN THE

EVENT OF FINANCIAL TURMOIL AFFECTING THE BANKING SYSTEM AND FINANCIAL MARKETS, ADDITIONAL CONSOLIDATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, OR SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SERVICE INSTITUTION FAILURES, THERE COULD BE A NEW OR INCREMENTAL TIGHTENING IN

THE CREDIT MARKETS, LOW LIQUIDITY AND EXTREME VOLATILITY IN FIXED INCOME, CREDIT, CURRENCY AND EQUITY MARKETS. THIS COULD HAVE A NUMBER OF EFFECTS ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE INSOLVENCY OR FINANCIAL INSTABILITY

OF OUTSOURCING PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS OR THEIR INABILITY TO OBTAIN CREDIT TO FINANCE DEVELOPMENT AND/OR MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS RESULTING IN PRODUCT DELAYS; INABILITY OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS, TO OBTAIN CREDIT TO

FINANCE PURCHASES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS; FAILURE OF DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS; AND RESTRICTIONS ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO ISSUE NEW DEBT. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE ALSO COULD VARY MATERIALLY

FROM EXPECTATIONS DEPENDING ON GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RESULTING FROM REVALUATIONS OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS; INTEREST RATES; CASH

BALANCES; VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES; AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. INCREASED VOLATILITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OVERALL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WOULD INCREASE THE RISK OF THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS REALIZED IN

THE FUTURE ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIFFERING SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE FAIR VALUES CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO THEM.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GLOBAL MARKETS FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT

TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THESE MARKETS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES COMPETE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL MARKETS CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE PRICE CUTTING AND RESULTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGINS, FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS,

CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT PRICE/PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS, RAPID ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT ADVANCEMENTS BY COMPETITORS AND PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY DEPENDS HEAVILY ON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY INTRODUCTION OF INNOVATIVE NEW

PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT DESIGNS AND DEVELOPS NEARLY THE ENTIRE SOLUTION FOR ITS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE HARDWARE, OPERATING SYSTEM, NUMEROUS SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND RELATED

SERVICES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MUST MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN R&D. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS AND HAS REGISTERED AND/OR HAS APPLIED TO REGISTER NUMEROUS PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE

MARKS. IN CONTRAST, MANY OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS SEEK TO COMPETE PRIMARILY THROUGH AGGRESSIVE PRICING AND VERY LOW COST STRUCTURES, AND EMULATING THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND INFRINGING ON ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.

IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND SELL INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS WITH ATTRACTIVE MARGINS OR IF COMPETITORS INFRINGE ON THE COMPANYS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY MARKETS CERTAIN MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES BASED ON THE IOS MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEM AND ALSO MARKETS

RELATED THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN THESE MARKETS FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER RESOURCES, AS WELL AS ESTABLISHED HARDWARE, SOFTWARE

AND DIGITAL CONTENT SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS; AND THE COMPANY HAS A MINORITY MARKET SHARE IN THE SMARTPHONE MARKET. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY FACES SIGNIFICANT PRICE COMPETITION AS COMPETITORS REDUCE THEIR SELLING PRICES AND ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THE

COMPANYS PRODUCT FEATURES AND APPLICATIONS WITHIN THEIR OWN PRODUCTS OR, ALTERNATIVELY, COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER TO OFFER SOLUTIONS THAT ARE MORE COMPETITIVE THAN THOSE THEY CURRENTLY OFFER. THE COMPANY ALSO COMPETES WITH ILLEGITIMATE WAYS

TO OBTAIN THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS AND WITH BUSINESS MODELS THAT INCLUDE CONTENT PROVIDED TO USERS FOR FREE. SOME OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER EXPERIENCE, PRODUCT BREADTH AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAN THE

COMPANY. BECAUSE SOME CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND/OR EXPERIENCE AND A LOWER COST STRUCTURE, THEY MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO PROFIT OR EVEN AT A LOSS. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS

COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS COMPETITORS ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THE COMPANYS APPROACH TO PROVIDING COMPONENTS SEAMLESSLY WITHIN THEIR INDIVIDUAL OFFERINGS OR WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO OFFER INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE IOS AND IOS DEVICES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN ADVANTAGES.

THE COMPANY IS THE ONLY AUTHORIZED MAKER OF HARDWARE USING OS X, WHICH HAS A MINORITY MARKET SHARE IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET. THIS MARKET HAS BEEN

CONTRACTING AND IS DOMINATED BY COMPUTER MAKERS USING COMPETING OPERATING SYSTEMS, MOST NOTABLY WINDOWS. IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND ACCESSORIES, THE COMPANY FACES A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, MANY OF WHICH HAVE BROADER PRODUCT

LINES, LOWER PRICED PRODUCTS AND A LARGER INSTALLED CUSTOMER BASE. HISTORICALLY, CONSOLIDATION IN THIS MARKET HAS RESULTED IN LARGER COMPETITORS. PRICE COMPETITION HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE AS COMPETITORS SELLING WINDOWS-BASED PERSONAL COMPUTERS

HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED PRODUCT MARGINS. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET-ENABLED DEVICES THAT INCLUDE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND ARE SMALLER AND SIMPLER THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH THE

COMPANYS EXISTING PRODUCTS. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS ALSO DEPEND ON ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE MAC PLATFORM TO MAINTAIN ITS FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN ADVANTAGES.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND, THE COMPANY MUST SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE

FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS.

DUE TO THE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY

COMPETES, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUALLY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES, ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR NEW AND UPGRADED PRODUCTS. THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS

DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, TIMELY AND SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCT PRODUCTION RAMP-UP ISSUES, THE AVAILABILITY OF

APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR NEW PRODUCTS, THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND INVENTORY LEVELS IN LINE WITH ANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEMAND, THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN APPROPRIATE QUANTITIES AND AT EXPECTED COSTS TO MEET ANTICIPATED

DEMAND, AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER DEFECTS OR DEFICIENCIES IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE IN ADVANCE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTORS, CARRIERS AND OTHER RESELLERS.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, WHOLESALERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS, AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, MANY OF

WHOM DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS FROM COMPETING MANUFACTURERS. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS ITS PRODUCTS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO EDUCATION, ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS, AND CONSUMERS AND SMALL AND MID-SIZED

BUSINESSES THROUGH ITS ONLINE AND RETAIL STORES.

CARRIERS PROVIDING CELLULAR NETWORK SERVICE FOR IPHONE TYPICALLY SUBSIDIZE USERS PURCHASES OF

THE DEVICE. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH SUBSIDIES WILL BE CONTINUED AT ALL OR IN THE SAME AMOUNTS UPON RENEWAL OF THE COMPANYS AGREEMENTS WITH THESE CARRIERS OR IN AGREEMENTS THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO WITH NEW CARRIERS.

MANY RESELLERS HAVE NARROW OPERATING MARGINS AND HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE PAST BY WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. SOME RESELLERS HAVE PERCEIVED THE

EXPANSION OF THE COMPANYS DIRECT SALES AS CONFLICTING WITH THEIR BUSINESS INTERESTS AS DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. SUCH A PERCEPTION COULD DISCOURAGE RESELLERS FROM INVESTING RESOURCES IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND

SALE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS OR LEAD THEM TO LIMIT OR CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE RESELLER SALES, INCLUDING STAFFING SELECTED RESELLERS STORES WITH

COMPANY EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS, AND IMPROVING PRODUCT PLACEMENT DISPLAYS. THESE PROGRAMS COULD REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT WHILE PROVIDING NO ASSURANCE OF RETURN OR INCREMENTAL REVENUE. THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THESE RESELLERS COULD

WEAKEN, THESE RESELLERS COULD STOP DISTRIBUTING THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, OR UNCERTAINTY REGARDING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS COULD CAUSE RESELLERS TO REDUCE THEIR ORDERING AND MARKETING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY AND OTHER ASSET RISK IN ADDITION TO PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION RISK.

THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR PRODUCT AND COMPONENT INVENTORIES THAT HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR EXCEED ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AND

ACCRUES NECESSARY CANCELLATION FEE RESERVES FOR ORDERS OF EXCESS PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO REVIEWS ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING CAPITAL ASSETS HELD AT ITS SUPPLIERS FACILITIES AND INVENTORY PREPAYMENTS, FOR IMPAIRMENT

WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED, IT RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS

ITS FAIR VALUE. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS PROVISIONS RELATED TO INVENTORY, CAPITAL ASSETS, INVENTORY PREPAYMENTS AND OTHER ASSETS AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS ARE CURRENTLY ADEQUATE, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR

ADDITIONAL RELATED CHARGES GIVEN THE RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE IN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES.

THE

COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND SHIPMENTS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, COMPONENTS ARE NORMALLY ACQUIRED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS

AND OPEN ORDERS, IN EACH CASE BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE PURCHASES ARE APPLIED TO INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE RESPECTIVE SUPPLIER. PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY

COVER FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS. BECAUSE THE COMPANYS MARKETS ARE VOLATILE, COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, THERE IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST

INCORRECTLY AND ORDER OR PRODUCE EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF COMPONENTS OR PRODUCTS, OR NOT FULLY UTILIZE FIRM PURCHASE COMMITMENTS.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND UPON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN COMPONENTS IN

SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY CURRENTLY OBTAINS COMPONENTS FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT

SUPPLY AND PRICING RISKS. MANY COMPONENTS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE SHORTAGES AND SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY PRICING FLUCTUATIONS. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS FOR

THE SUPPLY OF MANY COMPONENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO EXTEND OR RENEW THESE AGREEMENTS ON SIMILAR TERMS, OR AT ALL. A NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS OF COMPONENTS MAY SUFFER FROM POOR FINANCIAL CONDITIONS, WHICH CAN LEAD TO

BUSINESS FAILURE FOR THE SUPPLIER OR CONSOLIDATION WITHIN A PARTICULAR INDUSTRY, FURTHER LIMITING THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF COMPONENTS. THE FOLLOW-ON EFFECTS FROM GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON THE

COMPANYS SUPPLIERS, DESCRIBED IN 

GLOBAL AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY

ABOVE, ALSO COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN COMPONENTS.

THEREFORE, THE COMPANY

REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF SUPPLY SHORTAGES AND PRICE INCREASES.

THE COMPANY AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE MARKETS FOR MOBILE

COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS ALSO COMPETE FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY USES SOME CUSTOM COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF

THESE INDUSTRIES. THE COMPANYS NEW PRODUCTS OFTEN UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE. WHEN A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT USES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL THE SUPPLIERS YIELDS HAVE MATURED

OR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY HAS INCREASED. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES, OR AT ALL, MAY BE AFFECTED IF THOSE SUPPLIERS DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO

MEET THE COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS. THE SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS FOR A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT COULD BE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED, OR A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR COULD DELAY SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON COMPONENT AND PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, MANY OF WHOM ARE

LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING IS PERFORMED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY A FEW OUTSOURCING

PARTNERS LOCATED PRIMARILY IN ASIA. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO OUTSOURCED MUCH OF ITS TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT. WHILE THESE ARRANGEMENTS MAY LOWER OPERATING COSTS, THEY ALSO REDUCE THE COMPANYS DIRECT CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION AND

DISTRIBUTION. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT EFFECT SUCH DIMINISHED CONTROL WILL HAVE ON THE QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR THE COMPANYS FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH ARRANGEMENTS WITH THESE PARTNERS MAY

CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT, THE COMPANY MAY REMAIN RESPONSIBLE TO THE CONSUMER FOR WARRANTY SERVICE IN THE EVENT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS AND COULD EXPERIENCE AN UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEFECT OR WARRANTY LIABILITY. WHILE THE

COMPANY RELIES ON ITS PARTNERS TO ADHERE TO ITS SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT, MATERIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT COULD OCCUR.

THE

COMPANY RELIES ON SOLE-SOURCED OUTSOURCING PARTNERS IN THE U.S., ASIA AND EUROPE TO SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURE MANY CRITICAL COMPONENTS, AND ON OUTSOURCING PARTNERS PRIMARILY LOCATED IN ASIA, FOR FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS

HARDWARE PRODUCTS. ANY FAILURE OF THESE PARTNERS TO PERFORM MAY HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS COST OR SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS OR FINISHED GOODS. IN ADDITION, MANUFACTURING OR LOGISTICS IN THESE LOCATIONS OR TRANSIT TO FINAL DESTINATIONS

MAY BE DISRUPTED FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NATURAL AND MAN-MADE DISASTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES, COMMERCIAL DISPUTES, MILITARY ACTIONS OR ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, LABOR, ENVIRONMENTAL, PUBLIC HEALTH, OR

POLITICAL ISSUES.

THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED IN MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT, MUCH OF WHICH IS HELD AT CERTAIN OF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, AND HAS

MADE PREPAYMENTS TO CERTAIN OF ITS SUPPLIERS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS. WHILE THESE ARRANGEMENTS HELP ENSURE THE SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS AND FINISHED GOODS, IF THESE OUTSOURCING PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS EXPERIENCE SEVERE FINANCIAL

PROBLEMS OR OTHER DISRUPTIONS IN THEIR BUSINESS, THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THESE ASSETS COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY PROBLEMS FROM TIME TO TIME THAT CAN RESULT IN DECREASED SALES AND OPERATING MARGIN AND HARM TO THE COMPANYS REPUTATION.

THE COMPANY SELLS COMPLEX HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT CAN CONTAIN DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING DEFECTS. SOPHISTICATED OPERATING SYSTEM

SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE SOLD BY THE COMPANY, OFTEN CONTAIN BUGS THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE WITH THE SOFTWARES INTENDED OPERATION. THE COMPANYS ONLINE SERVICES MAY FROM TIME TO TIME EXPERIENCE OUTAGES,

SERVICE SLOWDOWNS, OR ERRORS. DEFECTS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THE COMPANY PURCHASES FROM THIRD PARTIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT AND FIX ALL DEFECTS IN THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IT

SELLS. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE, SIGNIFICANT WARRANTY AND OTHER EXPENSES AND HARM TO THE COMPANYS REPUTATION.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY RELIES ON ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE

COMPANY ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH NUMEROUS THIRD PARTIES TO OFFER THEIR DIGITAL CONTENT THROUGH

THE ITUNES STORE. THIS INCLUDES THE RIGHT TO MAKE AVAILABLE MUSIC, MOVIES, TV SHOWS AND BOOKS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE THROUGH THE ITUNES STORE. THE LICENSING OR OTHER DISTRIBUTION ARRANGEMENTS WITH THESE THIRD PARTIES ARE FOR RELATIVELY SHORT TERMS AND

DO NOT GUARANTEE THE CONTINUATION OR RENEWAL OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS ON REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. SOME THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS AND DISTRIBUTORS CURRENTLY OR IN THE FUTURE MAY OFFER COMPETING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND COULD TAKE ACTION TO

MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO LICENSE OR OTHERWISE DISTRIBUTE THEIR CONTENT IN THE FUTURE. OTHER CONTENT OWNERS, PROVIDERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAY SEEK TO LIMIT THE COMPANYS ACCESS TO, OR INCREASE THE COST OF, SUCH

CONTENT. THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF CONTENT AT REASONABLE PRICES WITH ACCEPTABLE USAGE RULES, OR CONTINUE TO EXPAND ITS GEOGRAPHIC REACH. FAILURE TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT TO MAKE AVAILABLE THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL

CONTENT, OR TO MAKE AVAILABLE SUCH CONTENT ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

SOME THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT PROVIDERS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT AND OTHER SECURITY SOLUTIONS. IF REQUIREMENTS CHANGE,

THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO DEVELOP OR LICENSE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE THESE SOLUTIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OR LICENSE SUCH SOLUTIONS AT A REASONABLE COST AND IN A TIMELY MANNER. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES

HAVE PASSED OR MAY PROPOSE AND ADOPT LEGISLATION THAT WOULD FORCE THE COMPANY TO LICENSE ITS DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT, WHICH COULD LESSEN THE PROTECTION OF CONTENT AND SUBJECT IT TO PIRACY AND ALSO COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE

COMPANYS CONTENT PROVIDERS.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE PERFORMANCE DEPENDS IN PART ON SUPPORT FROM

THIRD-PARTY

SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES DECISIONS BY CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE ITS HARDWARE

PRODUCTS DEPEND IN PART ON THE AVAILABILITY OF

THIRD-PARTY

SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND

SERVICES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. IF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES CEASE TO BE DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE NOT TO BUY THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO ITS MAC PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE AVAILABILITY OF

THIRD-PARTY

SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND

SERVICES DEPENDS IN PART ON THE DEVELOPERS PERCEPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING, MAINTAINING AND UPGRADING SUCH SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS COMPARED TO WINDOWS-BASED PRODUCTS. THIS ANALYSIS MAY BE BASED

ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE MARKET POSITION OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTS, THE ANTICIPATED REVENUE THAT MAY BE GENERATED, EXPECTED FUTURE GROWTH OF MAC SALES AND THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING SUCH APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES. IF THE COMPANYS MINORITY

SHARE OF THE GLOBAL PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET CAUSES DEVELOPERS TO QUESTION THE MACS PROSPECTS, DEVELOPERS COULD BE LESS INCLINED TO DEVELOP OR UPGRADE SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS MAC PRODUCTS AND MORE INCLINED TO DEVOTE THEIR RESOURCES TO

DEVELOPING AND UPGRADING SOFTWARE FOR THE LARGER WINDOWS MARKET.

WITH RESPECT TO IOS DEVICES, THE COMPANY RELIES ON THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY AND

DEVELOPMENT OF COMPELLING AND INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, WHICH ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A SINGLE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL, THE APP STORE. IOS DEVICES ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND, IF THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS ARE UNABLE TO OR CHOOSE

NOT TO KEEP UP WITH THIS PACE OF CHANGE, THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS MIGHT NOT SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE AND MAY RESULT IN DISSATISFIED CUSTOMERS. AS WITH APPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANYS MAC PRODUCTS, THE AVAILABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THESE

APPLICATIONS ALSO DEPEND ON DEVELOPERS PERCEPTIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS IOS DEVICES RATHER THAN ITS COMPETITORS PLATFORMS, SUCH AS ANDROID. IF DEVELOPERS FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS

ON THESE COMPETING PLATFORMS, THE AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANYS IOS DEVICES MAY SUFFER.

THE COMPANY

RELIES ON ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WHICH REQUIRES LICENSES FROM THOSE THIRD PARTIES. BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE

AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY CAN BE OBTAINED ON REASONABLE TERMS. THERE IS, HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. FAILURE TO OBTAIN THE RIGHT TO USE

THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR TO USE SUCH INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, COULD PRECLUDE THE COMPANY FROM SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR OTHERWISE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND OPERATING RESULTS.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY COULD BE IMPACTED BY UNFAVORABLE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SUCH AS BEING FOUND

TO HAVE INFRINGED ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN

FULLY RESOLVED AND THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS MAY ARISE IN THE FUTURE.

FOR EXAMPLE, TECHNOLOGY

COMPANIES, INCLUDING MANY OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS, FREQUENTLY ENTER INTO LITIGATION BASED ON ALLEGATIONS OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER VIOLATIONS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, PATENT HOLDING COMPANIES SEEK TO MONETIZE

PATENTS THEY HAVE PURCHASED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED. AS THE COMPANY HAS GROWN, THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS CLAIMS AGAINST IT HAVE INCREASED AND MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE. IN PARTICULAR, THE COMPANYS CELLULAR ENABLED PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH

MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICE COMPANIES THAT HOLD SIGNIFICANT PATENT PORTFOLIOS, AND THE NUMBER OF PATENT CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING INFRINGEMENT ACTIONS IN COURTS IN A

NUMBER OF U.S. JURISDICTIONS AND BEFORE THE U.S. INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION, AS WELL AS INTERNATIONALLY IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THESE ACTIONS FREQUENTLY SEEK INJUNCTIONS AND SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES.

REGARDLESS OF THE SCOPE OR VALIDITY OF SUCH PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, OR THE MERITS OF ANY CLAIMS BY POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL

LITIGANTS, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ENGAGE IN PROTRACTED LITIGATION. IF THE COMPANY IS FOUND TO INFRINGE ONE OR MORE PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT CAN DEVELOP NON-INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY, IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO

PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES TO A THIRD-PARTY, OR IT MAY BE SUBJECT TO A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION PROHIBITING THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING OR SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS.

IN CERTAIN CASES, THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER THE DESIRABILITY OF ENTERING INTO LICENSING AGREEMENTS, ALTHOUGH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH LICENSES

CAN BE OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR THAT LITIGATION WILL NOT OCCUR. THESE LICENSES MAY ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COMPANYS OPERATING EXPENSES.

REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OF PARTICULAR CLAIMS, LITIGATION MAY BE EXPENSIVE, TIME-CONSUMING, DISRUPTIVE TO THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND DISTRACTING TO

MANAGEMENT. IN RECOGNITION OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS TO SETTLE LITIGATION.

IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION,

THERE IS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS IN EXCESS OF A RECORDED ACCRUAL, WITH RESPECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING MATTERS RELATED TO INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.

ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF

ONE OR MORE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED. FURTHER, SUCH AN OUTCOME COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COMPENSATORY, PUNITIVE OR TREBLED MONETARY DAMAGES, DISGORGEMENT OF REVENUE OR PROFITS, REMEDIAL CORPORATE MEASURES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST THE COMPANY THAT COULD MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE, CHANGES TO

WHICH COULD INCREASE THE COMPANYS COSTS AND INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY

IS SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING ITS DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS. THESE U.S. AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECT THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, IN AREAS OF LABOR,

ADVERTISING, DIGITAL CONTENT, CONSUMER PROTECTION, REAL ESTATE, BILLING, E-COMMERCE, PROMOTIONS, QUALITY OF SERVICES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA, TELEVISION, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP AND INFRINGEMENT, TAX, IMPORT AND

EXPORT REQUIREMENTS, ANTI-CORRUPTION, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND CASH REPATRIATION RESTRICTIONS, DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS, ANTI-COMPETITION, ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH AND SAFETY.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA DEVICES IN THE MANY

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES ARE EXTENSIVE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE. SUCH CHANGES COULD INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, RESTRICTIONS ON THE PRODUCTION, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION AND USE OF DEVICES, LOCKING DEVICES TO A CARRIERS NETWORK, OR

MANDATING THE USE OF DEVICES ON MORE THAN ONE CARRIERS NETWORK. THESE DEVICES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTIFICATION AND REGULATION BY GOVERNMENTAL AND STANDARDIZATION BODIES, AS WELL AS BY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS FOR USE ON THEIR

NETWORKS. THESE CERTIFICATION PROCESSES ARE EXTENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING, AND COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL TESTING REQUIREMENTS, PRODUCT MODIFICATIONS, OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT SHIPMENT DATES, OR COULD PRECLUDE THE COMPANY FROM SELLING CERTAIN

PRODUCTS.

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS MAY BE ONEROUS AND EXPENSIVE, AND THEY MAY BE INCONSISTENT FROM

JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION, FURTHER INCREASING THE COST OF COMPLIANCE AND DOING BUSINESS. ANY SUCH COSTS, WHICH MAY RISE IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR IN THEIR INTERPRETATION, COULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE

AGGREGATE MAKE THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LESS ATTRACTIVE TO THE COMPANYS CUSTOMERS, DELAY THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS IN ONE OR MORE REGIONS, OR CAUSE THE COMPANY TO CHANGE OR LIMIT ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES. THE COMPANY HAS

IMPLEMENTED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS WILL NOT VIOLATE SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THE

COMPANYS POLICIES AND PROCEDURES.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS REVENUE AND EARNINGS FROM ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE U.S. AND FOREIGN LAWS

AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS IMPORT AND EXPORT REQUIREMENTS, ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS, TAX LAWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND CASH REPATRIATION RESTRICTIONS, DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, LABOR LAWS AND ANTI-COMPETITION REGULATIONS,

INCREASES THE COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO COMPLY WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, A VIOLATION BY THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS COULD

NEVERTHELESS OCCUR.

THE COMPANY ALSO COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO, ECONOMIC AND LABOR CONDITIONS, INCREASED DUTIES, TAXES AND OTHER COSTS AND POLITICAL INSTABILITY. MARGINS ON SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM

FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING DUTIES, TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO EXPOSED TO CREDIT AND COLLECTABILITY RISK ON ITS TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CUSTOMERS

IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY CAN EFFECTIVELY LIMIT ITS CREDIT RISK AND AVOID LOSSES.

THE

COMPANYS RETAIL SEGMENT HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT AND COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES AND IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

THE COMPANYS RETAIL STORES HAVE REQUIRED SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INVENTORY AND

PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS ENTERED INTO SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS FOR RETAIL SPACE. CERTAIN STORES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SERVE AS HIGH-PROFILE VENUES TO PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND SERVE AS VEHICLES FOR CORPORATE SALES

AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN ELEMENTS, LOCATIONS AND SIZE, THESE STORES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVESTMENT THAN THE COMPANYS MORE TYPICAL RETAIL STORES. DUE TO THE HIGH COST STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETAIL

SEGMENT, A DECLINE IN SALES OR THE CLOSURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL OR MULTIPLE STORES COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LEASE TERMINATION COSTS, WRITE-OFFS OF EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, AND SEVERANCE COSTS.

MANY FACTORS UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL, POSE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THESE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON GENERAL RETAIL ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS THE COMPANYS INABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STORE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION, THE

COMPANYS FAILURE TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS EXISTING RETAIL PARTNERS, MORE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENTS IN MANAGING RETAIL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S., COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF RETAIL INVENTORY, AND

THE COMPANYS INABILITY TO OBTAIN AND RENEW LEASES IN QUALITY RETAIL LOCATIONS AT A REASONABLE COST.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVESTMENT IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND ACQUISITIONS COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANYS ONGOING

BUSINESS AND PRESENT RISKS NOT ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED.

THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY INVEST, IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES OR

ACQUISITIONS. SUCH ENDEAVORS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING DISTRACTION OF MANAGEMENT FROM CURRENT OPERATIONS, GREATER THAN EXPECTED LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES, INADEQUATE RETURN OF CAPITAL AND UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES NOT

DISCOVERED IN THE COMPANYS DUE DILIGENCE. THESE NEW VENTURES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY AND MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL.

THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS AND REPUTATION MAY BE IMPACTED BY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES OR NETWORK DISRUPTIONS.

THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES AND NETWORK DISRUPTIONS. THESE MAY BE CAUSED BY NATURAL DISASTERS, ACCIDENTS, POWER DISRUPTIONS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, ACTS OF TERRORISM OR WAR, COMPUTER VIRUSES, PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS, OR

OTHER EVENTS OR DISRUPTIONS. SYSTEM REDUNDANCY MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR INADEQUATE, AND THE COMPANYS DISASTER RECOVERY PLANNING MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR ALL EVENTUALITIES. SUCH FAILURES OR DISRUPTIONS COULD PREVENT ACCESS TO THE COMPANYS

ONLINE STORES AND SERVICES, PRECLUDE RETAIL STORE TRANSACTIONS, COMPROMISE COMPANY OR CUSTOMER DATA, AND RESULT IN DELAYED OR CANCELLED ORDERS. SYSTEM FAILURES AND DISRUPTIONS COULD ALSO IMPEDE THE MANUFACTURING AND SHIPPING OF PRODUCTS, DELIVERY OF

ONLINE SERVICES, TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING.

THERE MAY BE BREACHES OF THE COMPANYS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

SYSTEMS THAT MATERIALLY DAMAGE BUSINESS PARTNER AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, CURTAIL OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY IMPACT ACCESS TO ONLINE STORES AND SERVICES, OR SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL, FINANCIAL, LEGAL AND OPERATIONAL

CONSEQUENCES.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS REQUIRES IT TO USE AND STORE CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE AND BUSINESS PARTNER PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE

INFORMATION (PII). THIS MAY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER INFORMATION, NAMES, ADDRESSES, PHONE NUMBERS, EMAIL ADDRESSES, CONTACT PREFERENCES, TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS AND PAYMENT ACCOUNT INFORMATION. ALTHOUGH MALICIOUS ATTACKS TO GAIN ACCESS TO

PII AFFECT MANY COMPANIES ACROSS VARIOUS INDUSTRIES, THE COMPANY IS AT A RELATIVELY GREATER RISK OF BEING TARGETED BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH PROFILE AND THE AMOUNT OF PII IT MANAGES.

THE COMPANY REQUIRES USER NAMES AND PASSWORDS IN ORDER TO ACCESS ITS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES ENCRYPTION AND AUTHENTICATION

TECHNOLOGIES DESIGNED TO SECURE THE TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OF DATA AND PREVENT ACCESS TO COMPANY DATA OR ACCOUNTS. AS WITH ALL COMPANIES, THESE SECURITY MEASURES ARE SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY SECURITY BREACHES, EMPLOYEE ERROR, MALFEASANCE, FAULTY

PASSWORD MANAGEMENT, OR OTHER IRREGULARITIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THIRD PARTIES MAY ATTEMPT TO FRAUDULENTLY INDUCE EMPLOYEES OR CUSTOMERS INTO DISCLOSING USER NAMES, PASSWORDS OR OTHER SENSITIVE INFORMATION, WHICH MAY IN TURN BE USED TO ACCESS THE

COMPANYS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. TO HELP PROTECT CUSTOMERS AND THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY MONITORS ACCOUNTS AND SYSTEMS FOR UNUSUAL ACTIVITY AND MAY FREEZE ACCOUNTS UNDER SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE DELAY OR LOSS OF

CUSTOMER ORDERS.

THE COMPANY DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO NETWORK SECURITY, DATA ENCRYPTION AND OTHER SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT ITS SYSTEMS

AND DATA, BUT THESE SECURITY MEASURES CANNOT PROVIDE ABSOLUTE SECURITY. TO THE EXTENT THE COMPANY WAS TO EXPERIENCE A BREACH OF ITS SYSTEMS AND WAS UNABLE TO PROTECT SENSITIVE DATA, SUCH A BREACH COULD MATERIALLY DAMAGE BUSINESS PARTNER AND CUSTOMER

RELATIONSHIPS, AND CURTAIL OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY IMPACT ACCESS TO ONLINE STORES AND SERVICES. MOREOVER, IF A COMPUTER SECURITY BREACH AFFECTS THE COMPANYS SYSTEMS OR RESULTS IN THE UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE OF PII, THE COMPANYS REPUTATION

AND BRAND COULD BE MATERIALLY DAMAGED, USE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD DECREASE, AND THE COMPANY COULD BE EXPOSED TO A RISK OF LOSS OR LITIGATION AND POSSIBLE LIABILITY. WHILE THE COMPANY MAINTAINS INSURANCE COVERAGE THAT,

SUBJECT TO POLICY TERMS AND CONDITIONS AND SUBJECT TO A SIGNIFICANT SELF-INSURED RETENTION, IS DESIGNED TO ADDRESS CERTAIN ASPECTS OF CYBER RISKS, SUCH INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER ALL LOSSES OR ALL TYPES OF CLAIMS THAT MAY ARISE

IN THE CONTINUALLY EVOLVING AREA OF CYBER RISK.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS, RULES,

POLICIES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS REGARDING DATA PROTECTION.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS RELATING TO THE

COLLECTION, USE, RETENTION, SECURITY AND TRANSFER OF PII. IN MANY CASES, THESE LAWS APPLY NOT ONLY TO THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, BUT ALSO TO TRANSFERS OF INFORMATION BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND AMONG THE COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARIES

AND OTHER PARTIES WITH WHICH THE COMPANY HAS COMMERCIAL RELATIONS. SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE PASSED LAWS IN THIS AREA, AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE CONSIDERING IMPOSING ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS. THESE LAWS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MAY BE INCONSISTENT

FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. COMPLYING WITH EMERGING AND CHANGING INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS MAY CAUSE THE COMPANY TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS OR REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CHANGE ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES. NONCOMPLIANCE COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES OR

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL LIABILITY.

THE COMPANYS PRIVACY POLICY, WHICH INCLUDES RELATED PRACTICES CONCERNING THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF DATA, IS

POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE. ANY FAILURE BY THE COMPANY, ITS SUPPLIERS OR OTHER PARTIES WITH WHOM THE COMPANY DOES BUSINESS TO COMPLY WITH ITS POSTED PRIVACY POLICY OR WITH OTHER FEDERAL, STATE OR INTERNATIONAL PRIVACY-RELATED OR DATA PROTECTION LAWS AND

REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN PROCEEDINGS AGAINST THE COMPANY BY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES OR OTHERS.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO PAYMENT CARD

ASSOCIATION RULES AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER ITS CONTRACTS WITH PAYMENT CARD PROCESSORS. UNDER THESE RULES AND OBLIGATIONS, IF INFORMATION IS COMPROMISED, THE COMPANY COULD BE LIABLE TO PAYMENT CARD ISSUERS FOR ASSOCIATED EXPENSES AND PENALTIES. IN

ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO FOLLOW PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY SECURITY STANDARDS, EVEN IF NO CUSTOMER INFORMATION IS COMPROMISED, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT FINES OR EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PAYMENT CARD TRANSACTION COSTS.

THE COMPANYS SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE AND AVAILABILITY OF KEY PERSONNEL.

MUCH OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY AND SERVICE OF KEY PERSONNEL, INCLUDING ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER,

EXECUTIVE TEAM AND OTHER HIGHLY SKILLED EMPLOYEES. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY IN SILICON VALLEY, WHERE MOST OF THE COMPANYS KEY PERSONNEL ARE

LOCATED.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS MAY BE IMPACTED BY POLITICAL EVENTS, WAR, TERRORISM, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, NATURAL DISASTERS AND

OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS.

WAR, TERRORISM, GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AND OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS HAVE CAUSED

AND COULD CAUSE DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION TO INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AND THUS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY, ITS SUPPLIERS, LOGISTICS PROVIDERS, MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERRUPTION BY, AMONG OTHERS, NATURAL DISASTERS, WHETHER AS A RESULT OF CLIMATE CHANGE OR OTHERWISE, FIRE, POWER SHORTAGES, NUCLEAR POWER PLANT ACCIDENTS, TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER HOSTILE

ACTS, LABOR DISPUTES, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES AND OTHER EVENTS BEYOND ITS CONTROL. SUCH EVENTS COULD DECREASE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO MAKE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS,

INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS, OR TO RECEIVE COMPONENTS FROM ITS SUPPLIERS, AND CREATE DELAYS AND INEFFICIENCIES IN THE COMPANYS SUPPLY CHAIN. SHOULD MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING PANDEMICS, ARISE, THE COMPANY COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY MORE STRINGENT EMPLOYEE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS IN FREIGHT SERVICES, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS BETWEEN REGIONS, DELAYS IN PRODUCTION RAMPS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE

COMPANYS MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS R&D ACTIVITIES, ITS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN COMPONENT

SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS, ARE IN LOCATIONS THAT COULD BE AFFECTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS. IN THE EVENT OF A NATURAL DISASTER, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL RECOVERY TIME AND EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT

EXPENDITURES IN ORDER TO RESUME OPERATIONS.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS QUARTERLY REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE.

THE COMPANYS PROFIT MARGINS VARY ACROSS ITS PRODUCTS AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE COMPANYS SOFTWARE, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT

CONTRACTS GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER GROSS MARGINS THAN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS OTHER PRODUCTS. GROSS MARGINS ON THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS VARY ACROSS PRODUCT LINES AND CAN CHANGE OVER TIME AS A RESULT OF PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, PRICING AND

CONFIGURATION CHANGES, AND COMPONENT, WARRANTY, AND OTHER COST FLUCTUATIONS. THE COMPANYS DIRECT SALES GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER ASSOCIATED GROSS MARGINS THAN ITS INDIRECT SALES THROUGH ITS CHANNEL PARTNERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS GROSS

MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES, AS WELL AS OVERALL PROFITABILITY, MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIC OR CHANNEL MIX, COMPONENT COST INCREASES, THE STRENGTHENING U.S. DOLLAR, PRICE COMPETITION,

OR THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES WITH FLAT OR REDUCED PRICING.

THE COMPANY HAS TYPICALLY

EXPERIENCED HIGHER NET SALES IN ITS FIRST QUARTER COMPARED TO OTHER QUARTERS DUE IN PART TO SEASONAL HOLIDAY DEMAND. ADDITIONALLY, NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT NET SALES, PRODUCT COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES. THE COMPANY COULD

BE SUBJECT TO UNEXPECTED DEVELOPMENTS LATE IN A QUARTER, SUCH AS LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, ISSUES WITH NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AN INTERNAL SYSTEMS FAILURE, OR FAILURE OF ONE OF THE COMPANYS LOGISTICS,

COMPONENTS SUPPLY, OR MANUFACTURING PARTNERS.

THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY.

THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE HAS EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY IN THE PAST AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE. ADDITIONALLY, THE

COMPANY, THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY AND THE STOCK MARKET AS A WHOLE HAVE EXPERIENCED EXTREME STOCK PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED STOCK PRICES IN WAYS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN UNRELATED TO THESE COMPANIES OPERATING PERFORMANCE. PRICE

VOLATILITY OVER A GIVEN PERIOD MAY CAUSE THE AVERAGE PRICE AT WHICH THE COMPANY REPURCHASES ITS OWN STOCK TO EXCEED THE STOCKS PRICE AT A GIVEN POINT IN TIME. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS STOCK PRICE REFLECTS EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE GROWTH AND

PROFITABILITY. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES ITS STOCK PRICE REFLECTS EXPECTATIONS THAT ITS CASH DIVIDEND WILL CONTINUE AT CURRENT LEVELS OR GROW AND THAT ITS CURRENT SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WILL BE FULLY CONSUMMATED. FUTURE DIVIDENDS ARE SUBJECT TO

DECLARATION BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AND THE COMPANYS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT OBLIGATE IT TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MEET ANY OF THESE EXPECTATIONS RELATED TO FUTURE GROWTH,

PROFITABILITY, DIVIDENDS, SHARE REPURCHASES OR OTHER MARKET EXPECTATIONS, ITS STOCK PRICE MAY DECLINE SIGNIFICANTLY, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND EMPLOYEE RETENTION.

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS LOCAL

CURRENCIES.

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATES TO NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SALES

AND OPERATING EXPENSES WORLDWIDE. WEAKENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR ADVERSELY AFFECTS THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS, AND GENERALLY LEADS THE COMPANY TO RAISE

INTERNATIONAL PRICING, POTENTIALLY REDUCING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. MARGINS ON SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, FOR COMPETITIVE OR OTHER REASONS, THE COMPANY MAY DECIDE NOT TO RAISE LOCAL PRICES TO FULLY OFFSET THE DOLLARS STRENGTHENING, OR AT ALL, WHICH

WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS. CONVERSELY, A STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR, WHILE GENERALLY BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANYS

FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS, COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY TO REDUCE INTERNATIONAL PRICING AND INCUR LOSSES ON ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, THEREBY LIMITING THE BENEFIT. ADDITIONALLY, STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES

MAY ALSO INCREASE THE COMPANYS COST OF PRODUCT COMPONENTS DENOMINATED IN THOSE CURRENCIES, THUS ADVERSELY AFFECTING GROSS MARGINS.

THE COMPANY

USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS, TO HEDGE CERTAIN EXPOSURES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF SUCH HEDGING ACTIVITIES MAY NOT OFFSET ANY, OR MORE THAN A PORTION, OF THE

ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OVER THE LIMITED TIME THE HEDGES ARE IN PLACE.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO.

GIVEN THE GLOBAL NATURE OF ITS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY HAS BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS. CREDIT RATINGS AND PRICING

OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS CAN BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY LIQUIDITY, CREDIT DETERIORATION, FINANCIAL RESULTS, ECONOMIC RISK, POLITICAL RISK, SOVEREIGN RISK OR OTHER FACTORS. AS A RESULT, THE VALUE AND LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANYS CASH, CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES MAY FLUCTUATE SUBSTANTIALLY. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS NOT REALIZED ANY SIGNIFICANT LOSSES ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, FUTURE FLUCTUATIONS IN THEIR VALUE COULD RESULT IN A

SIGNIFICANT REALIZED LOSS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES AND

PREPAYMENTS RELATED TO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS, AND THIS RISK IS HEIGHTENED DURING PERIODS WHEN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORSEN.

THE COMPANY

DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS ITS PRODUCTS DIRECTLY TO SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES AND EDUCATION, ENTERPRISE AND GOVERNMENT

CUSTOMERS. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL, THIRD-PARTY FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS OR CREDIT INSURANCE. THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT AND COLLECTABILITY RISK ON ITS TRADE

RECEIVABLES IS HIGHER IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND ITS ABILITY TO MITIGATE SUCH RISKS MAY BE LIMITED. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS UNSECURED VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES RESULTING FROM PURCHASES OF COMPONENTS BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS AND OTHER

VENDORS THAT MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS MADE PREPAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO SECURE SUPPLY OF INVENTORY COMPONENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES WAS CONCENTRATED WITHIN CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, AND ITS VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES AND PREPAYMENTS RELATED TO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS WERE CONCENTRATED AMONG A FEW INDIVIDUAL

VENDORS LOCATED PRIMARILY IN ASIA. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES TO MONITOR AND LIMIT EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE AND VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES, AS WELL AS LONG-TERM PREPAYMENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE SUCH PROCEDURES WILL

EFFECTIVELY LIMIT ITS CREDIT RISK AND AVOID LOSSES.

THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO CHANGES IN ITS TAX RATES, THE ADOPTION OF NEW U.S.

OR INTERNATIONAL TAX LEGISLATION OR EXPOSURE TO ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO TAXES IN THE U.S. AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN

JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING IRELAND, WHERE A NUMBER OF THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES ARE ORGANIZED. DUE TO ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, TAX RATES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS MAY BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE. THE COMPANYS FUTURE EFFECTIVE

TAX RATES COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION, INCLUDING IN THE U.S. AND

IRELAND. FOR EXAMPLE, IN JUNE 2014, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION OPENED A FORMAL INVESTIGATION TO EXAMINE WHETHER DECISIONS BY THE TAX AUTHORITIES IN IRELAND WITH REGARD TO THE CORPORATE INCOME TAX TO BE PAID BY TWO OF THE COMPANYS IRISH

SUBSIDIARIES COMPLY WITH EUROPEAN UNION RULES ON STATE AID. IF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION WERE TO TAKE A FINAL DECISION AGAINST IRELAND, IT COULD REQUIRE CHANGES TO EXISTING TAX RULINGS THAT, IN TURN, COULD INCREASE THE COMPANYS TAXES IN THE

FUTURE. THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION COULD ALSO REQUIRE IRELAND TO RECOVER FROM THE COMPANY PAST TAXES REFLECTIVE OF THE DISALLOWED STATE AID.

THE

COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE EXAMINATION OF ITS TAX RETURNS AND OTHER TAX MATTERS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES AND GOVERNMENTAL BODIES. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF AN ADVERSE OUTCOME RESULTING FROM

THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO THE OUTCOME OF THESE EXAMINATIONS. IF THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE TO INCREASE, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S. OR IRELAND, OR IF THE

ULTIMATE DETERMINATION OF THE COMPANYS TAXES OWED IS FOR AN AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED, THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS, CASH FLOWS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

CUSTOMER SUPPORT CALL CENTER; FACILITIES IN ELK GROVE, CALIFORNIA THAT INCLUDED WAREHOUSING AND DISTRIBUTION OPERATIONS AND A CUSTOMER SUPPORT CALL CENTER; AND A MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN MESA, ARIZONA. THE COMPANY ALSO OWNED LAND IN AUSTIN, TEXAS

WHERE IT IS EXPANDING ITS EXISTING OFFICE SPACE AND CUSTOMER SUPPORT CALL CENTER. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY OWNED FACILITIES FOR R&D AND CORPORATE FUNCTIONS IN CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA, INCLUDING LAND THAT IS BEING DEVELOPED FOR THE COMPANYS

SECOND CORPORATE CAMPUS. THE COMPANY ALSO OWNED DATA CENTERS IN NEWARK, CALIFORNIA; MAIDEN, NORTH CAROLINA; PRINEVILLE, OREGON; AND RENO, NEVADA. OUTSIDE THE U.S., THE COMPANY OWNED ADDITIONAL FACILITIES FOR VARIOUS PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS EXISTING FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT, WHICH ARE USED BY ALL OPERATING SEGMENTS, ARE IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION AND ARE SUITABLE

FOR THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESS. THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED IN INTERNAL CAPACITY AND STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS WITH OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND CONTINUES TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN CAPITAL EQUIPMENT AS NEEDED TO MEET ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR ITS

PRODUCTS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS DISCUSSED

BELOW AS WELL AS CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY RESOLVED AND THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE

INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS IN EXCESS OF A RECORDED ACCRUAL, WITH RESPECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. THEREFORE,

ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SEE THE RISK FACTOR 

THE COMPANY COULD BE IMPACTED BY UNFAVORABLE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SUCH AS BEING FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED ON

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

 IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING RISK FACTORS. THE COMPANY SETTLED CERTAIN MATTERS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014 THAT DID NOT INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE APPLE IPOD ITUNES ANTITRUST LITIGATION

(FORMERLY CHAROENSAK V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC. AND TUCKER V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC.)

THESE RELATED CASES WERE FILED ON JANUARY 3, 2005 AND

JULY 21, 2006 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA ON BEHALF OF A PURPORTED CLASS OF DIRECT PURCHASERS OF IPODS AND ITUNES STORE CONTENT, ALLEGING VARIOUS CLAIMS INCLUDING ALLEGED UNLAWFUL TYING OF MUSIC

FISCAL 2014 HIGHLIGHTS

NET SALES

INTRODUCTION OF IPHONE 5S AND 5C IN THE LATTER HALF OF CALENDAR YEAR 2013, THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF IPHONE 6 AND 6 PLUS BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, AND EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION. MAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO

STRONG DEMAND FOR MACBOOK AIR AND MACBOOK PRO WHICH WERE UPDATED IN 2014 WITH FASTER PROCESSORS AND OFFERED AT LOWER PRICES. NET SALES OF ITUNES, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES GREW PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED REVENUE FROM SALES THROUGH THE APP STORE,

APPLECARE AND LICENSING. NET SALES AND UNIT SALES FOR IPAD DECLINED IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 DUE TO LOWER UNIT SALES IN MANY MARKETS. GROWTH IN TOTAL NET SALES DURING 2014 WAS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE CONTINUING DECLINE OF IPOD SALES. ALL OF

THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS OTHER THAN THE REST OF ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENT EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES IN 2014, WITH GROWTH BEING STRONGEST IN THE GREATER CHINA AND JAPAN OPERATING SEGMENTS.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED IPAD AIR, ITS FIFTH GENERATION IPAD AND IPAD MINI WITH RETINA DISPLAY. AT ITS WORLDWIDE

ONLINE SALES OF APPS, DIGITAL CONTENT AND SERVICES. GROWTH IN THESE AREAS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN NET SALES OF MAC AND IPOD. ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES IN 2013, WITH NET SALES GROWTH

BEING PARTICULARLY STRONG IN THE AMERICAS, GREATER CHINA AND JAPAN OPERATING SEGMENTS. GROWTH IN TOTAL NET SALES WAS HIGHER DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2013, RISING $12.6 BILLION OR 14.7% OVER THE SAME PERIOD IN 2012. FIRST HALF GROWTH IN 2013 WAS

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN IPHONE NET SALES AND UNIT SALES IN 2014 RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM THE SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION

OF NEW IPHONES IN THE LATTER HALF OF CALENDAR YEAR 2013, THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF IPHONE 6 AND 6 PLUS BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 2014, AND EXPANDED DISTRIBUTION. IPHONE UNIT SALES GREW IN ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHILE IPHONE NET

SALES GREW IN ALL SEGMENTS EXCEPT REST OF ASIA PACIFIC. OVERALL AVERAGE SELLING PRICES (ASPS) FOR IPHONE WERE RELATIVELY FLAT IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013, WITH GROWTH IN ASPS IN THE AMERICAS AND RETAIL SEGMENTS BEING OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN

ASPS IN THE GREATER CHINA, JAPAN AND REST OF ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENTS.

THE GROWTH IN IPHONE NET SALES AND UNIT SALES DURING 2013 RESULTED FROM

INCREASED DEMAND FOR IPHONE IN ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LAUNCH OF IPHONE 5 BEGINNING IN SEPTEMBER 2012 AND STRONG ONGOING DEMAND FOR IPHONE 4 AND 4S. ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS EXPERIENCED

INCREASES IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF IPHONE DURING 2013 COMPARED TO 2012. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF HIGHER IPHONE UNIT SALES IN 2013 WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 3% DECLINE IN IPHONE ASPS PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TOWARDS

LOWER-PRICED IPHONE MODELS, PARTICULARLY IPHONE 4. ALL OF THE COMPANYS GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN IPHONE ASPS DURING 2013.

NET SALES AND UNIT SALES FOR IPAD DECLINED IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013. IPAD NET SALES AND UNIT SALES GREW IN THE GREATER

CHINA AND JAPAN SEGMENTS BUT THIS GROWTH WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN ALL OTHER SEGMENTS. OVERALL IPAD ASPS WERE RELATIVELY FLAT IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 WITH A SHIFT IN MIX TO HIGHER-PRICED IPADS BEING OFFSET BY THE OCTOBER 2013 PRICE

REDUCTION OF IPAD MINI. ASPS INCREASED IN THE JAPAN AND RETAIL SEGMENTS BUT WERE FLAT TO SLIGHTLY DOWN IN OTHER SEGMENTS.

THE GROWTH IN NET SALES

AND UNIT SALES OF IPAD DURING 2013 RESULTED FROM GROWTH IN IPAD UNIT SALES IN ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS. THIS GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY THE LAUNCH OF IPAD MINI AND THE FOURTH GENERATION IPAD BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013. THE

YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH RATE OF TOTAL IPAD UNIT SALES WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE GROWTH RATE OF TOTAL IPAD NET SALES FOR 2013 DUE TO A REDUCTION IN IPAD ASPS OF 15% IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012. THIS DECLINE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM INTRODUCTION OF

THE LOWER PRICED IPAD MINI AND THE FULL YEAR IMPACT OF THE PRICE REDUCTION ON IPAD 2 MADE IN 2012. THE DECLINE IN IPAD ASPS WAS EXPERIENCED TO VARIOUS DEGREES BY ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN MAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES FOR 2014 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED SALES OF MACBOOK

AIR, MACBOOK PRO AND MAC PRO. MAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES INCREASED IN ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS. MAC ASPS DECREASED DURING 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 PRIMARILY DUE TO PRICE REDUCTIONS ON CERTAIN MAC MODELS AND A SHIFT IN MIX TOWARDS

MAC PORTABLE SYSTEMS.

MAC NET SALES AND UNIT SALES FOR 2013 WERE DOWN OR RELATIVELY FLAT IN ALL OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING SEGMENTS. MAC ASPS

INCREASED SLIGHTLY PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE IMPACT OF LOWER UNIT SALES ON NET SALES. THE DECLINE IN MAC UNIT SALES AND NET SALES REFLECTED THE OVERALL WEAKNESS IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS.

FROM APP SALES REFLECTING CONTINUED GROWTH IN THE INSTALLED BASE OF IOS DEVICES AND THE EXPANDED OFFERINGS OF IOS APPS AND RELATED IN-APP PURCHASES. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN SALES OF DIGITAL MUSIC.

THE INCREASE IN NET SALES OF ITUNES, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IN 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH IN NET SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE,

APPLECARE AND LICENSING. THE ITUNES STORE GENERATED A TOTAL OF $9.3 BILLION IN NET SALES DURING 2013, A 24% INCREASE FROM 2012. GROWTH IN THE ITUNES STORE, WHICH INCLUDES THE APP STORE, THE MAC APP STORE AND THE IBOOKS STORE, REFLECTED CONTINUED

THE GREATER CHINA SEGMENT EXPERIENCED YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN NET SALES IN 2014 THAT WAS SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER THAN THE

GROWTH RATE FOR THE COMPANY OVERALL. GREATER CHINA GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER UNIT SALES AND NET SALES OF ALL MAJOR PRODUCT CATEGORIES EXCEPT IPOD, IN ADDITION TO HIGHER NET SALES OF ITUNES, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES. GROWTH IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES

OF IPHONE WAS ESPECIALLY STRONG, DRIVEN BY THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF IPHONE 5S AND 5C IN MAINLAND CHINA AND HONG KONG IN SEPTEMBER 2013, THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF IPHONE 6 AND 6 PLUS IN HONG KONG IN SEPTEMBER 2014, INCREASED DEMAND FOR THE

COMPANYS ENTRY-PRICED IPHONES AND THE ADDITION OF A SIGNIFICANT NEW CARRIER IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014.

ITUNES STORE NET SALES AND AN INCREASE IN IPHONE CHANNEL INVENTORY AS OF THE END OF 2013 COMPARED TO THE END OF 2012. THESE POSITIVE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN ASPS FOR IPHONE AND IPAD AND BY WEAKNESS IN THE JAPANESE YEN RELATIVE

THE GROWTH IN RETAIL SEGMENT NET SALES IN 2014 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASES IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF IPHONE

AND MAC, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF IPAD AND IPOD. WITH AN AVERAGE OF 424 AND 403 OPEN STORES DURING 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY, AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE INCREASED TO $50.6 MILLION IN 2014 FROM $50.2 MILLION IN

2013.

THE GROWTH IN RETAIL SEGMENT NET SALES DURING 2013 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED UNIT SALES OF IPHONE AND IPAD FOLLOWING THE NEW PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2013 AND INCREASED SALES OF SERVICES. WITH AN AVERAGE OF 403 AND 365 OPEN STORES DURING 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY, AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE DECREASED TO $50.2 MILLION IN 2013, COMPARED TO $51.5 MILLION IN 2012.

THE RETAIL SEGMENTS OPERATING INCOME WAS $4.6 BILLION, $4.0 BILLION AND $4.6 BILLION DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE

YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME IN 2014 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER NET SALES AND HIGHER GROSS MARGIN PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER MIX OF IPHONE. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME IN 2013 WAS

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER GROSS MARGIN SIMILAR TO THAT EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY OVERALL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET SALES.

REDUCTIONS ON SELECT PRODUCTS AND HIGHER COST STRUCTURES ON CERTAIN NEW PRODUCTS.

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECREASE IN GROSS MARGIN IN 2013 COMPARED TO

SIGNIFICANTLY BELOW THE COMPANYS AVERAGE PRODUCT MARGINS; HIGHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGES TO CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS SERVICE POLICIES AND OTHER WARRANTY COSTS; PRICE REDUCTIONS ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IPAD 2 AND IPHONE 4;

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES GROSS MARGIN DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015 TO BE BETWEEN 37.5% AND 38.5%. THE

FOREGOING STATEMENT REGARDING THE COMPANYS EXPECTED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015 IS FORWARD-LOOKING AND COULD DIFFER FROM ACTUAL RESULTS. THE COMPANYS FUTURE GROSS MARGINS CAN BE IMPACTED BY MULTIPLE FACTORS

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO THOSE SET FORTH ABOVE IN PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING RISK FACTORS AND THOSE DESCRIBED IN THIS PARAGRAPH. IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY BELIEVES GROSS MARGINS WILL REMAIN UNDER DOWNWARD

PRESSURE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED INDUSTRY WIDE GLOBAL PRODUCT PRICING PRESSURES, INCREASED COMPETITION, COMPRESSED PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COST OF COMPONENTS AND POTENTIAL

STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, AS WELL AS POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COSTS OF OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES AND A POTENTIAL SHIFT IN THE COMPANYS SALES MIX TOWARDS PRODUCTS WITH LOWER GROSS MARGINS. IN RESPONSE TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES,

THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PRODUCT PRICING ACTIONS, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS. GROSS MARGINS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE PRODUCT QUALITY AND WARRANTY COSTS EFFECTIVELY AND TO

STIMULATE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS. DUE TO THE COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL RESULTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) EXPENSE

THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR GROWTH IN 2014 AND 2013 R&D EXPENSE WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT AND RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION COSTS AND MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT TO SUPPORT EXPANDED R&D ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT FOCUSED INVESTMENTS IN R&D ARE CRITICAL TO ITS FUTURE GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND ARE

DIRECTLY RELATED TO TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE COMPANYS CORE BUSINESS STRATEGY. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO MAKE FURTHER INVESTMENTS IN R&D TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) EXPENSE

THE GROWTH IN SG&A EXPENSE DURING 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND RELATED EXPENSES, INCLUDING SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION COSTS; HIGHER SPENDING ON MARKETING, ADVERTISING AND PROFESSIONAL SERVICES; AND THE COMPANYS CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT. THE GROWTH IN SG&A DURING 2013 COMPARED TO 2012 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE COMPANYS

CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT AND INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND RELATED EXPENSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED SPENDING ON PROFESSIONAL SERVICES.

THE DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE DURING 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE ON

DEBT AND HIGHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PREMIUM EXPENSES ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AND HIGHER INTEREST INCOME. THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE DURING 2013 WAS

DUE PRIMARILY TO HIGHER INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME RESULTING FROM THE COMPANYS HIGHER CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCES AND LOWER PREMIUM EXPENSES ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INTEREST EXPENSE ON

DEBT ISSUED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013 AND HIGHER EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENTS. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED BY THE COMPANY ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WAS 1.11%, 1.03% AND 1.03%

DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY HAD NO DEBT OUTSTANDING DURING 2012 AND ACCORDINGLY DID NOT INCUR ANY RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE.

THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR ALL YEARS DIFFER FROM THE STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE OF 35% DUE

PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS, A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF WHICH WAS GENERATED BY SUBSIDIARIES ORGANIZED IN IRELAND, FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE

U.S.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMPANY HAD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARISING FROM DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TAX LOSSES AND TAX CREDITS OF

$5.1 BILLION AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $20.3 BILLION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH FUTURE REVERSALS

OF EXISTING TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE REALIZABILITY OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS QUARTERLY BY ASSESSING THE NEED FOR AND THE AMOUNT OF A VALUATION

ALLOWANCE.

DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) CONCLUDED ITS REVIEW OF THE

YEARS 2004 THROUGH 2009. THE IRS IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING THE YEARS 2010 THROUGH 2012. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ANY

ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANYS TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS

EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATE NO. 2014-09, REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

(TOPIC 606) (ASU 2014-09), WHICH AMENDS THE EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. ASU 2014-09 IS BASED ON PRINCIPLES THAT GOVERN THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AT AN AMOUNT AN ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED WHEN PRODUCTS ARE

TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS. ASU 2014-09 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN ITS FIRST QUARTER OF 2018. EARLY ADOPTION IS NOT PERMITTED. THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD MAY BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO EACH PRIOR PERIOD PRESENTED OR

RETROSPECTIVELY WITH THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT RECOGNIZED AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THE NEW REVENUE STANDARD ON ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CAPITAL ASSETS

THE COMPANYS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $11.0 BILLION DURING 2014, CONSISTING OF $491 MILLION FOR RETAIL STORE FACILITIES AND $10.5 BILLION FOR OTHER

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT AND OTHER CORPORATE FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THE COMPANYS ACTUAL CASH PAYMENTS FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING 2014 WERE $9.6 BILLION.

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES UTILIZING APPROXIMATELY $13.0 BILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING 2015, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION FOR RETAIL STORE

FACILITIES AND APPROXIMATELY $12.4 BILLION FOR OTHER CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT, DATA CENTERS AND CORPORATE FACILITIES AND INFRASTRUCTURE, INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND

ENHANCEMENTS.

DURING 2015, THE COMPANY ALSO EXPECTS TO REMODEL APPROXIMATELY FIVE OF ITS EXISTING STORES.

DEBT

IN APRIL 2014, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE COMPANY TO ISSUE UNSECURED SHORT-TERM PROMISSORY NOTES (COMMERCIAL PAPER) PURSUANT TO A

COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO USE THE NET PROCEEDS FROM THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMPANY HAD $6.3 BILLION OF

COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING, WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 0.12% AND MATURITIES GENERALLY LESS THAN NINE MONTHS.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF

2014 AND 2013, THE COMPANY ISSUED $12.0 BILLION AND $17.0 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, RESPECTIVELY. THE DEBT ISSUANCES INCLUDED FLOATING- AND FIXED-RATE NOTES WITH VARYING MATURITIES FOR AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $29.0 BILLION (COLLECTIVELY

THE NOTES). THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED, AND MAY ENTER IN THE FUTURE, INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISK ON THE NOTES. INTEREST RATE SWAPS ALLOW THE COMPANY TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED-RATE PAYMENTS INTO FLOATING-RATE

PAYMENTS OR FLOATING-RATE PAYMENTS INTO FIXED-RATE PAYMENTS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $9.0 BILLION, WHICH EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED MOST OF THE FIXED-RATE NOTES INTO

FLOATING-RATE NOTES, AND IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $3.0 BILLION, WHICH EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED THE FLOATING-RATE NOTES INTO FIXED-RATE NOTES.

CAPITAL RETURN PROGRAM

IN APRIL 2014, THE COMPANYS BOARD

OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZATION FROM $60 BILLION TO $90 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK, OF WHICH $67.9 BILLION HAD BEEN UTILIZED AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014. THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO

BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF DECEMBER 2015. THE COMPANYS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT OBLIGATE IT TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES. UNDER THE PROGRAM, SHARES MAY BE REPURCHASED IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED OR OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS,

INCLUDING UNDER PLANS COMPLYING WITH RULE 10B5-1 UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY UTILIZES SEVERAL OUTSOURCING PARTNERS TO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND TO PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TESTING

OF FINISHED PRODUCTS. THESE OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ACQUIRE COMPONENTS AND BUILD PRODUCT BASED ON DEMAND INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH TYPICALLY COVERS PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS. THE COMPANY ALSO OBTAINS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS

FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. WHERE

APPROPRIATE, THE PURCHASES ARE APPLIED TO INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE RESPECTIVE SUPPLIER.

OTHER

OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANYS OTHER OBLIGATIONS WERE COMPRISED MAINLY OF COMMITMENTS TO ACQUIRE CAPITAL ASSETS, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND

MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT AND COMMITMENTS RELATED TO ADVERTISING, R&D, INTERNET AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS.

THE

COMPANYS OTHER NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS AND THE RELATED GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMPANY

HAD NON-CURRENT DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $20.3 BILLION. ADDITIONALLY, AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMPANY HAD GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF $4.0 BILLION AND AN ADDITIONAL $630 MILLION FOR GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES CLASSIFIED AS

NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLY RELIABLE ESTIMATE OF THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS IN INDIVIDUAL YEARS IN CONNECTION WITH THESE TAX LIABILITIES; THEREFORE, SUCH AMOUNTS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TABLE.

INDEMNIFICATION

THE COMPANY

GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE

INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT

PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST IT OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS WITH RESPECT TO

INDEMNIFICATION OF END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM OR APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT COSTS RELATED TO INDEMNIFICATION AS OF

SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 OR SEPTEMBER 28, 2013.

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH ITS DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO INDEMNIFY SUCH INDIVIDUALS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AGAINST LIABILITIES THAT ARISE BY REASON OF THEIR STATUS AS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS AND TO ADVANCE EXPENSES INCURRED BY SUCH

INDIVIDUALS IN CONNECTION WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS DUE TO THE LIMITED HISTORY OF PRIOR INDEMNIFICATION

CLAIMS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN EACH CLAIM. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH OBLIGATIONS AND PAYMENTS MADE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS HISTORICALLY

HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) AND

THE COMPANYS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS REQUIRE THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN

THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE

BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE COMPANYS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF

MARKETABLE SECURITIES, INVENTORY VALUATION AND VALUATION OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS AND ESTIMATED PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEES, WARRANTY COSTS, INCOME TAXES AND LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THESE POLICIES

CRITICAL BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN MATTERS. THE COMPANYS SENIOR

MANAGEMENT HAS REVIEWED THESE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND RELATED DISCLOSURES WITH THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE

FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED

OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE, RISK OF LOSS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA

ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY

RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL

CONTENT SOLD ON THE ITUNES STORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SALES TRANSACTIONS.

(I) STANDALONE SALES OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, (II) SALES OF SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND (III) SALES OF SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE.

FOR MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE HARDWARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCTS FUNCTIONALITY, UNDELIVERED

SOFTWARE ELEMENTS THAT RELATE TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCTS ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE AND/OR UNDELIVERED NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY

USES A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO DELIVERABLES: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (VSOE), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE (TPE) AND

(III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE (ESP). VSOE GENERALLY EXISTS ONLY WHEN THE COMPANY SELLS THE DELIVERABLE SEPARATELY AND IS THE PRICE ACTUALLY CHARGED BY THE COMPANY FOR THAT DELIVERABLE. ESPS REFLECT THE COMPANYS BEST

ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES OF ELEMENTS WOULD BE IF THEY WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.

FOR SALES OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF

IOS DEVICES, MAC AND APPLE TV, THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED IT MAY FROM TIME TO TIME PROVIDE FUTURE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND FEATURES FREE OF CHARGE TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES VARIOUS NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES TO OWNERS OF QUALIFYING

VERSIONS OF IOS DEVICES AND MAC. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE FOR THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS OR THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THESE RIGHTS AND SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANYS ESPS. REVENUE

ALLOCATED TO THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES BASED ON THE COMPANYS ESPS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THE SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE

EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED FOR EACH OF THESE DEVICES, WHICH RANGES FROM TWO TO FOUR YEARS.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANYS PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS INVOLVES MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE

FACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE. SHOULD FUTURE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE, THE COMPANYS ESPS AND THE FUTURE RATE OF RELATED AMORTIZATION FOR SOFTWARE UPGRADES

AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES RELATED TO FUTURE SALES OF THESE DEVICES COULD CHANGE. FACTORS SUBJECT TO CHANGE INCLUDE THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS OFFERED, THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS, THE ESTIMATED OR ACTUAL

COSTS INCURRED TO PROVIDE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES AND THE ESTIMATED PERIOD SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED.

THE COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. FOR TRANSACTIONS

INVOLVING PRICE PROTECTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE NET OF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED, PROVIDED THE REFUND AMOUNT CAN BE REASONABLY AND RELIABLY ESTIMATED AND THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET. THE

COMPANYS POLICY REQUIRES THAT, IF REFUNDS CANNOT BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED, REVENUE IS NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL RELIABLE ESTIMATES CAN BE MADE OR THE PRICE PROTECTION LAPSES. FOR THE COMPANYS OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATED COST

IS RECOGNIZED AT THE LATER OF THE DATE AT WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT OR THE DATE AT WHICH THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE. FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT TRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INCREASE CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS THAT COULD RESULT IN REDUCTIONS TO FUTURE REVENUE. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO

ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY REDEEM THE INCENTIVE. MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PARTICULAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IF A GREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF

CUSTOMERS REDEEMS SUCH INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

VALUATION AND IMPAIRMENT OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES

THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, NET OF TAX, IN THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES IMPACT THE COMPANYS NET INCOME ONLY WHEN SUCH SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT IS RECOGNIZED. REALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES ON THE SALE OF SECURITIES ARE DETERMINED BY SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF EACH SECURITYS COST BASIS. THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO DETERMINE IF ANY SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WHICH WOULD

REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO RECORD AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN THE PERIOD ANY SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, THE COMPANY EVALUATES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF A SECURITY IS LESS THAN ITS COST;

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER AND ANY CHANGES THERETO; AND THE COMPANYS INTENT TO SELL, OR WHETHER IT WILL MORE LIKELY THAN NOT BE REQUIRED TO SELL, THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY OF ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS. THE COMPANYS

ASSESSMENT ON WHETHER A SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE DUE TO NEW DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS RELATED TO ANY PARTICULAR SECURITY.

INVENTORY VALUATION AND VALUATION OF MANUFACTURING-RELATED ASSETS AND ESTIMATED PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION FEES

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS AND HAS INVESTED IN MANUFACTURING PROCESS

EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING CAPITAL ASSETS HELD AT ITS SUPPLIERS FACILITIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS MADE PREPAYMENTS TO CERTAIN OF ITS SUPPLIERS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO SECURE SUPPLY OF INVENTORY COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY

RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED REVIEW OF

INVENTORY THAT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. THE COMPANY ALSO REVIEWS ITS MANUFACTURING-RELATED CAPITAL ASSETS AND

INVENTORY PREPAYMENTS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF SUCH ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT AN ASSET IS NOT RECOVERABLE, IT RECORDS AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT

BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF SUCH AN ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES ARE SUBJECT TO A RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT AND

COMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE AND DEMAND CHANGES. IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS OF INVENTORY, INVENTORY PREPAYMENTS AND/OR MANUFACTURING-RELATED CAPITAL ASSETS. THESE CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDE FUTURE

DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS BEING LESS FAVORABLE THAN FORECASTED, UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES OR CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE UTILITY OF ANY OF THESE ASSETS,

OR SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANYS SUPPLIERS THAT HOLD ANY OF THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT OR TO WHOM THE COMPANY HAS MADE AN INVENTORY PREPAYMENT. SUCH WRITE-DOWNS

WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE WRITE-DOWNS WERE RECORDED.

THE COMPANY RECORDS ACCRUALS FOR

ESTIMATED CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO COMPONENT ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED OR ARE EXPECTED TO BE CANCELLED. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS AND

OPEN ORDERS IN EACH CASE BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE PURCHASES ARE APPLIED TO INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE RESPECTIVE SUPPLIER. PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANYS

FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, IF THE COMPANYS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS CHANGE, OR IF

THERE IS AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, THEN THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL ACCRUALS FOR CANCELLATION FEES THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE

PERIOD WHEN THE CANCELLATION FEES ARE IDENTIFIED AND RECORDED.

WARRANTY COSTS

THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST OF WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM

RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANYS TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. EACH QUARTER, THE COMPANY RE-EVALUATES THESE ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED

WARRANTY LIABILITIES CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY. IF ACTUAL PRODUCT FAILURE RATES OR REPAIR COSTS DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED

WARRANTY LIABILITIES WOULD BE REQUIRED AND COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY RECORDS A TAX PROVISION FOR THE ANTICIPATED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED

USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR

OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR

SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES TAX BENEFITS FROM UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON

EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH POSITIONS ARE THEN MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD

OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE

GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH FUTURE REVERSALS OF EXISTING TAXABLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COMPANY DETERMINES ALL OR PART OF

THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE NOT REALIZABLE IN THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY WILL MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE THAT WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF TAX LIABILITIES

INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF GAAP AND COMPLEX TAX LAWS. RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

AS DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN THE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTE 10, COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A LIABILITY WHEN IT

IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT REQUIRED IN BOTH THE PROBABILITY DETERMINATION AND AS TO WHETHER AN EXPOSURE CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT,

THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS IN EXCESS OF A RECORDED ACCRUAL, WITH RESPECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES FOR LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN A REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS AND INTEREST RATE SWAPS, BOTH ON A

STAND-ALONE

BASIS AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS UNDERLYING FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE RELATED EXPOSURES. GIVEN THE EFFECTIVE HORIZONS OF THE COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE ANTICIPATORY

NATURE OF THE EXPOSURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THESE POSITIONS WILL OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM MOVEMENTS IN EITHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE OR INTEREST RATES. FURTHER, THE RECOGNITION OF THE GAINS AND LOSSES

RELATED TO THESE INSTRUMENTS MAY NOT COINCIDE WITH THE TIMING OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC EXPOSURES AND, THEREFORE, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

INTEREST RATE RISK

WHILE THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO INTEREST

RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN MANY OF THE WORLDS LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES, THE COMPANYS INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE MOST SENSITIVE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN U.S. INTEREST RATES. CHANGES IN U.S. INTEREST RATES AFFECT THE INTEREST EARNED ON

THE COMPANYS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE SECURITIES, AS WELL AS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH HEDGING AND INTEREST PAID ON THE COMPANYS DEBT.

INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT POLICY AND STRATEGY

ARE FOCUSED ON PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL AND SUPPORTING THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY USES A COMBINATION OF INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL MANAGEMENT TO EXECUTE ITS INVESTMENT STRATEGY AND ACHIEVE ITS INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES.

THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY INVESTS IN

HIGHLY-RATED SECURITIES, AND ITS INVESTMENT POLICY GENERALLY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE POLICY REQUIRES INVESTMENTS GENERALLY TO BE INVESTMENT GRADE, WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF MINIMIZING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF

PRINCIPAL LOSS.

TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY

PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ASSUMING A 100 BASIS POINT PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE. BASED ON INVESTMENT POSITIONS AS OF

SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, A HYPOTHETICAL 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS ALL MATURITIES WOULD RESULT IN A $3.4 BILLION INCREMENTAL DECLINE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO. AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2013, A SIMILAR 100 BASIS

POINT INCREASE IN THE YIELD CURVE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A $2.7 BILLION INCREMENTAL DECLINE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO. SUCH LOSSES WOULD ONLY BE REALIZED IF THE COMPANY SOLD THE INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO MATURITY.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEBT

IN APRIL

2014, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE COMPANY TO ISSUE COMMERCIAL PAPER PURSUANT TO A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMPANY HAD $6.3 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING, WITH MATURITIES GENERALLY LESS THAN

NINE MONTHS.

IN THE THIRD QUARTERS OF 2014 AND 2013, THE COMPANY ISSUED $12.0 BILLION AND $17.0 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, RESPECTIVELY. THE DEBT

ISSUANCES INCLUDED FLOATING- AND FIXED-RATE NOTES WITH VARYING MATURITIES FOR AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF $29.0 BILLION (COLLECTIVELY THE NOTES). THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED, AND MAY ENTER IN THE FUTURE, INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO

MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISK ON THE NOTES. INTEREST RATE SWAPS ALLOW THE COMPANY TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED-RATE PAYMENTS INTO FLOATING-RATE PAYMENTS OR FLOATING-RATE PAYMENTS INTO FIXED-RATE PAYMENTS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014, THE COMPANY

ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $9.0 BILLION, WHICH EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED MOST OF THE FIXED-RATE NOTES INTO FLOATING-RATE NOTES, AND IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2013, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS

WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $3.0 BILLION, WHICH EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED THE FLOATING-RATE NOTES INTO FIXED-RATE NOTES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN MARKET INTEREST RATES WOULD CAUSE INTEREST EXPENSE ON THE

COMPANYS DEBT TO INCREASE BY $110 MILLION ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS.

FURTHER DETAILS REGARDING THE COMPANYS DEBT IS PROVIDED IN PART II,

ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM

IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTE 6, DEBT.

FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY IS A NET RECEIVER OF CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, AND IN

PARTICULAR A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, WILL NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS NET SALES AND GROSS MARGINS AS EXPRESSED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THERE IS A RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL HAVE TO ADJUST LOCAL CURRENCY PRODUCT PRICING DUE TO COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES WHEN THERE HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND

OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN

SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANYS PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A PORTION OF ITS MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES, TYPICALLY FOR UP TO 12 MONTHS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE NOT TO HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS,

INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS AND THE PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES.

TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL

ASSESSMENT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE POSITIONS, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS USING A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF

FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES. THE VAR MODEL CONSISTED OF USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TO GENERATE THOUSANDS OF RANDOM MARKET PRICE PATHS ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS. THE VAR IS THE MAXIMUM EXPECTED LOSS IN FAIR VALUE, FOR A GIVEN

CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, TO THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE POSITIONS DUE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN RATES. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE MODEL ASSUMES

NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE MODEL, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE A MAXIMUM

ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF $240 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 COMPARED TO A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF $201 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2013. BECAUSE THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS FOR HEDGING PURPOSES, THE

LOSS IN FAIR VALUE INCURRED ON THOSE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES.

ACTUAL FUTURE

GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 DUE TO THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PREDICTING

THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGES RATES AND THE COMPANYS ACTUAL EXPOSURES AND POSITIONS.

GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE

PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THESE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR IS THE 52

OR 53-WEEK PERIOD THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF SEPTEMBER. THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEARS 2014, 2013 AND 2012 ENDED ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, SEPTEMBER 28, 2013 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, RESPECTIVELY. AN ADDITIONAL WEEK IS

INCLUDED IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS TO REALIGN FISCAL QUARTERS WITH CALENDAR QUARTERS. FISCAL YEARS 2014 AND 2013 SPANNED 52 WEEKS EACH. FISCAL YEAR 2012 SPANNED 53 WEEKS, WITH A 14TH WEEK INCLUDED IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2012. UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, REFERENCES TO PARTICULAR YEARS, QUARTERS, MONTHS AND PERIODS REFER TO THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEARS ENDED IN SEPTEMBER AND THE ASSOCIATED QUARTERS, MONTHS AND PERIODS OF THOSE FISCAL YEARS.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014, THE COMPANY ADOPTED UPDATED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT (I) REQUIRED DISCLOSURE OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THE

AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) BY COMPONENT AND (II) REQUIRED GROSS AND NET DISCLOSURES ABOUT OFFSETTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE ADOPTION OF THESE UPDATED STANDARDS ONLY IMPACTED THE

DISCLOSURES IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; ACCORDINGLY, THE ADOPTION HAD NO IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED THESE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES IN THIS

FORM 10-K

IN NOTE 8, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND NOTE 2, FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, RESPECTIVELY.

COMMON

STOCK SPLIT

ON JUNE 6, 2014, THE COMPANY EFFECTED A SEVEN-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF JUNE 2, 2014. ALL SHARE

AND PER SHARE INFORMATION HAS BEEN RETROACTIVELY ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE STOCK SPLIT.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS, ACCESSORIES AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT

CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN

SHIPPED AND TITLE, RISK OF LOSS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION

CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FROM THE

SALE OF HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE, AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT SOLD ON THE ITUNES STORE IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERAL REVENUE RECOGNITION ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE. THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR THE FOLLOWING TYPES OF SALES TRANSACTIONS: (I) STANDALONE SALES OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, (II) SALES OF SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND (III) SALES OF

SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH HARDWARE NOT ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE.

APPLE INC. | 2014 FORM 10-K | 50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR THE SALE OF MOST THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE BASED ON THE GROSS AMOUNT BILLED

TO CUSTOMERS BECAUSE THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES ITS OWN PRICING FOR SUCH PRODUCTS, RETAINS RELATED INVENTORY RISK FOR PHYSICAL PRODUCTS, IS THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE CUSTOMER AND ASSUMES THE CREDIT RISK FOR AMOUNTS BILLED TO ITS CUSTOMERS. FOR

THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS SOLD THROUGH THE APP STORE AND MAC APP STORE AND CERTAIN DIGITAL CONTENT SOLD THROUGH THE ITUNES STORE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE OF THE PRODUCTS AND IS NOT THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR TO THE CUSTOMER.

THEREFORE, THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR SUCH SALES ON A NET BASIS BY RECOGNIZING IN NET SALES ONLY THE COMMISSION IT RETAINS FROM EACH SALE. THE PORTION OF THE GROSS AMOUNT BILLED TO CUSTOMERS THAT IS REMITTED BY THE COMPANY TO THIRD-PARTY APP

DEVELOPERS AND CERTAIN DIGITAL CONTENT OWNERS IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY RECORDS

DEFERRED REVENUE WHEN IT RECEIVES PAYMENTS IN ADVANCE OF THE DELIVERY OF PRODUCTS OR THE PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES. THIS INCLUDES AMOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN DEFERRED FOR UNSPECIFIED AND SPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES THAT ARE

ATTACHED TO HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY SELLS GIFT CARDS REDEEMABLE AT ITS RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES, AND ALSO SELLS GIFT CARDS REDEEMABLE ON THE ITUNES STORE FOR THE PURCHASE OF DIGITAL CONTENT AND SOFTWARE. THE COMPANY RECORDS

DEFERRED REVENUE UPON THE SALE OF THE CARD, WHICH IS RELIEVED UPON REDEMPTION OF THE CARD BY THE CUSTOMER. REVENUE FROM APPLECARE SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE SERVICE COVERAGE PERIODS. APPLECARE SERVICE AND

SUPPORT CONTRACTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE EXTENDED PHONE SUPPORT, REPAIR SERVICES, WEB-BASED SUPPORT RESOURCES AND DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS OFFERED UNDER THE COMPANYS STANDARD LIMITED WARRANTY.

THE COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. FOR TRANSACTIONS

INVOLVING PRICE PROTECTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE NET OF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED. FOR THE COMPANYS OTHER CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS RECOGNIZED AT THE LATER OF THE DATE AT WHICH THE

COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT OR THE DATE AT WHICH THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. REVENUE IS RECORDED NET OF TAXES

COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS THAT ARE REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, WITH THE COLLECTED TAXES RECORDED AS CURRENT LIABILITIES UNTIL REMITTED TO THE RELEVANT GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY.

REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES

FOR MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE HARDWARE PRODUCTS CONTAINING SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCTS FUNCTIONALITY, UNDELIVERED

SOFTWARE ELEMENTS THAT RELATE TO THE HARDWARE PRODUCTS ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE, AND UNDELIVERED NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES. IN SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES, THE COMPANY USES

A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE SELLING PRICE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO DELIVERABLES: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (VSOE), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE (TPE) AND

(III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE (ESP). VSOE GENERALLY EXISTS ONLY WHEN THE COMPANY SELLS THE DELIVERABLE SEPARATELY AND IS THE PRICE ACTUALLY CHARGED BY THE COMPANY FOR THAT DELIVERABLE. ESPS REFLECT THE COMPANYS BEST

ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES OF ELEMENTS WOULD BE IF THEY WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. FOR MULTI-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY ALLOCATES

REVENUE TO ALL DELIVERABLES BASED ON THE VSOE OF EACH ELEMENT, AND IF VSOE DOES NOT EXIST REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN ELEMENTS LACKING VSOE ARE DELIVERED.

FOR SALES OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IPHONE, IPAD AND IPOD TOUCH (IOS DEVICES), MAC AND APPLE TV, THE COMPANY HAS INDICATED IT MAY FROM TIME

TO TIME PROVIDE FUTURE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND FEATURES TO THE ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE BUNDLED WITH EACH OF THESE HARDWARE PRODUCTS FREE OF CHARGE TO CUSTOMERS. ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE FOR IOS DEVICES INCLUDES IOS AND RELATED APPLICATIONS AND FOR

MAC INCLUDES OS X AND RELATED APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES VARIOUS NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES TO OWNERS OF QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IOS DEVICES AND MAC. THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED UP TO THREE DELIVERABLES REGULARLY INCLUDED IN ARRANGEMENTS

INVOLVING THE SALE OF THESE DEVICES. THE FIRST DELIVERABLE IS THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE HARDWARE DEVICE DELIVERED AT THE TIME OF SALE. THE SECOND DELIVERABLE IS THE EMBEDDED RIGHT INCLUDED WITH THE PURCHASE OF

IOS DEVICES, MAC AND APPLE TV TO RECEIVE ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS, FUTURE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND FEATURES RELATING TO THE PRODUCTS ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE. THE THIRD DELIVERABLE IS THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES TO BE PROVIDED TO

QUALIFYING VERSIONS OF IOS DEVICES AND MAC. THE COMPANY ALLOCATES REVENUE BETWEEN THESE DELIVERABLES USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE FOR THESE DELIVERABLES, THE ALLOCATION OF REVENUE IS BASED ON

THE COMPANYS ESPS. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE DELIVERED HARDWARE AND THE RELATED ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE IS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE PROVIDED THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE EMBEDDED

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THE SOFTWARE UPGRADES AND NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE EXPECTED TO

BE PROVIDED FOR EACH OF THESE DEVICES, WHICH RANGES FROM TWO TO FOUR YEARS. COST OF SALES RELATED TO DELIVERED HARDWARE AND RELATED ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE, INCLUDING ESTIMATED WARRANTY COSTS, ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE. COSTS INCURRED TO PROVIDE

NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS COST OF SALES AS INCURRED, AND ENGINEERING AND SALES AND MARKETING COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS OPERATING EXPENSES AS INCURRED.

THE COMPANYS PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ITS ESP FOR DELIVERABLES WITHOUT VSOE OR TPE CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY DEPENDING UPON THE

UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS CUSTOMERS WOULD BE RELUCTANT TO BUY UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS FOR THE ESSENTIAL SOFTWARE INCLUDED WITH ITS QUALIFYING HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THIS VIEW IS

PRIMARILY BASED ON THE FACT THAT UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS DO NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE UPGRADES AT A PARTICULAR TIME OR AT ALL, AND DO NOT SPECIFY TO CUSTOMERS WHICH UPGRADES OR FEATURES WILL BE DELIVERED. THE COMPANY ALSO

BELIEVES ITS CUSTOMERS WOULD BE UNWILLING TO PAY A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT FOR ACCESS TO THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES BECAUSE OTHER COMPANIES OFFER SIMILAR SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO COST TO USERS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY HAS CONCLUDED THAT IF IT WERE TO SELL

UPGRADE RIGHTS OR ACCESS TO THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES ON A STANDALONE BASIS, INCLUDING THOSE RIGHTS AND SERVICES ATTACHED TO IOS DEVICES, MAC AND APPLE TV, THE SELLING PRICES WOULD BE RELATIVELY LOW. KEY FACTORS CONSIDERED BY THE COMPANY IN

DEVELOPING THE ESPS FOR SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS INCLUDE PRICES CHARGED BY THE COMPANY FOR SIMILAR OFFERINGS, MARKET TRENDS IN THE PRICING OF APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY MAC AND IOS COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE, THE NATURE OF THE UPGRADE RIGHTS (E.G.,

UNSPECIFIED VERSUS SPECIFIED) AND THE RELATIVE ESP OF THE UPGRADE RIGHTS AS COMPARED TO THE TOTAL SELLING PRICE OF THE PRODUCT. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO CONSIDER ADDITIONAL FACTORS AS APPROPRIATE, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS, THE PRICING OF COMPETITIVE ALTERNATIVES IF THEY EXIST, PRODUCT-SPECIFIC BUSINESS OBJECTIVES AND THE LENGTH OF TIME A PARTICULAR VERSION OF A DEVICE HAS BEEN AVAILABLE. WHEN RELEVANT, THE SAME FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED BY THE

COMPANY IN DEVELOPING ESPS FOR OFFERINGS SUCH AS THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES WITH ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO THE ESTIMATED COST TO PROVIDE SUCH SERVICES.

IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, THE COMPANYS COMBINED ESPS FOR THE UNSPECIFIED SOFTWARE UPGRADE RIGHTS AND THE RIGHTS TO RECEIVE THE NON-SOFTWARE SERVICES

INCLUDED WITH ITS QUALIFYING HARDWARE DEVICES HAVE RANGED FROM $5 TO $40. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMBINED ESPS FOR MAC WAS $40 AND FOR IPHONE AND IPAD RANGED FROM $15 TO $25. REVENUE ALLOCATED TO SUCH RIGHTS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED ON

A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED PERIOD THE RIGHTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PROVIDED FOR EACH DEVICE, WHICH RANGES FROM TWO TO FOUR YEARS.

SHIPPING COSTS

FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS RELATED TO SHIPPING AND HANDLING ARE CLASSIFIED AS REVENUE, AND THE COMPANYS

SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES.

WARRANTY COSTS

THE COMPANY GENERALLY PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY

ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PRE-EXISTING WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

(R&D) COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE MARKETED ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITALIZATION BEGINNING WHEN A PRODUCTS TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND

ENDING WHEN A PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. IN MOST INSTANCES, THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED SOON AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. COSTS INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL

FEASIBILITY WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT, AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS WERE EXPENSED AS INCURRED DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012.

ADVERTISING COSTS

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND INCLUDED IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.2 BILLION, $1.1

BILLION AND $1.0 BILLION FOR 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES EXPENSE RELATED TO SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH IT RECEIVES EMPLOYEE SERVICES IN EXCHANGE FOR (A) EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS OF THE COMPANY OR (B) LIABILITIES THAT ARE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ENTERPRISES EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OR THAT MAY BE SETTLED BY THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST FOR RESTRICTED STOCK AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) IS MEASURED BASED ON THE CLOSING FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST OVER THE AWARDS REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD

ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS FOR TIME-BASED RSUS AND ON A GRADED BASIS FOR RSUS THAT ARE CONTINGENT ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE METRICS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES A BENEFIT FROM SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IF AN INCREMENTAL TAX BENEFIT IS REALIZED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION ON R&D TAX CREDITS, FOREIGN TAX CREDITS AND DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING DEDUCTIONS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 9, BENEFIT PLANS OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

INCOME TAXES

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING

THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND FOR

OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED OR

SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON

EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH POSITIONS ARE THEN MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD

OF BEING REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT. SEE NOTE 5, INCOME TAXES OF THIS FORM 10-K FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD INCREASED TO INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF

ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IF THE POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES HAD BEEN ISSUED. POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES INCLUDE OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, SHARES TO BE PURCHASED UNDER THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE

STOCK PURCHASE PLAN, UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK AND UNVESTED RSUS. THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES IS REFLECTED IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPLICATION OF THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. UNDER THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD, AN

INCREASE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK CAN RESULT IN A GREATER DILUTIVE EFFECT FROM POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES

ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE

CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE COMPANYS MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE.

MANAGEMENT

DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND REEVALUATES THE DESIGNATIONS AT EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES ITS MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES AS EITHER SHORT-TERM OR LONG-TERM BASED ON EACH

INSTRUMENTS UNDERLYING CONTRACTUAL MATURITY DATE. MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES WITH MATURITIES OF 12 MONTHS OR LESS ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM AND MARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN 12 MONTHS ARE CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM.

THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES ITS MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES, INCLUDING MUTUAL FUNDS, AS EITHER SHORT-TERM OR LONG-TERM BASED ON THE NATURE OF EACH SECURITY AND ITS AVAILABILITY FOR USE IN CURRENT OPERATIONS. THE COMPANYS MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY

SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH THE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE COST OF SECURITIES SOLD IS BASED UPON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND CARRIES THEM AT FAIR VALUE.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO

VARIABILITY IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF AOCI IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND RECLASSIFIED INTO INCOME IN

THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT, IF ANY, IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT INCOME. TO RECEIVE HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, CASH FLOW

HEDGES MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING CHANGES TO EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE

RECOGNIZED IN INCOME. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY AND THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, BOTH THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE

OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EXPOSURE OF THE NET INVESTMENT IN A

FOREIGN OPERATION, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS REPORTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS A FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. FOR FORWARD EXCHANGE CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THE

COMPANY EXCLUDES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RELATING TO CHANGES IN THE FORWARD CARRY COMPONENT FROM ITS DEFINITION OF EFFECTIVENESS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THIS COMPONENT ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT INCOME. DERIVATIVES THAT DO NOT

QUALIFY AS HEDGES ARE ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE THROUGH CURRENT INCOME.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY RECORDS ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED UPON ITS ASSESSMENT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THE AGE

OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCES, CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COMPANYS CUSTOMERS, CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO PAY.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST,

COMPUTED USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD, OR MARKET. IF THE COST OF THE INVENTORIES EXCEEDS THEIR MARKET VALUE, PROVISIONS ARE MADE CURRENTLY FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND THE MARKET VALUE.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

ARE STATED AT COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED BY USE OF THE

STRAIGHT-LINE

METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH FOR BUILDINGS IS THE LESSER OF 30 YEARS OR THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE

UNDERLYING BUILDING; BETWEEN TWO TO FIVE YEARS FOR MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT; AND THE SHORTER OF LEASE TERMS OR TEN YEARS FOR LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES ELIGIBLE COSTS

TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE THAT ARE INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE. CAPITALIZED COSTS RELATED TO INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS,

WHICH RANGE FROM THREE TO FIVE YEARS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WAS $6.9 BILLION, $5.8 BILLION AND $2.6 BILLION DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES, EXCLUDING GOODWILL, FOR

IMPAIRMENT. LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF THESE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS

TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE. IF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED EQUALS THE

AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENTS DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES, RATHER SUCH ASSETS ARE REQUIRED TO BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT

LEAST ANNUALLY OR SOONER WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE ASSETS MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY PERFORMS ITS GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT TESTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE

ANY IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO GOODWILL OR INDEFINITE LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED REPORTING UNITS BASED ON ITS CURRENT REPORTING STRUCTURE. FOR PURPOSES OF TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, GOODWILL

HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THESE REPORTING UNITS TO THE EXTENT IT RELATES TO EACH REPORTING UNIT. IN 2014 AND 2013, THE COMPANYS GOODWILL WAS ALLOCATED TO THE AMERICAS AND EUROPE REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THE COMPANY AMORTIZES ITS INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWS THESE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE

COMPANY TYPICALLY AMORTIZES ITS ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE USEFUL LIVES OVER PERIODS FROM THREE TO SEVEN YEARS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE COMPANY APPLIES FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING FOR ALL FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR

DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS. THE COMPANY DEFINES FAIR VALUE AS THE PRICE THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FROM SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS

AT THE MEASUREMENT DATE. WHEN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS FOR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE PRINCIPAL OR MOST ADVANTAGEOUS MARKET IN WHICH THE COMPANY WOULD TRANSACT

AND THE MARKET-BASED RISK MEASUREMENTS OR ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, SUCH AS RISKS INHERENT IN VALUATION TECHNIQUES, TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS AND CREDIT RISK. FAIR VALUE IS ESTIMATED BY APPLYING

THE FOLLOWING HIERARCHY, WHICH PRIORITIZES THE INPUTS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE INTO THREE LEVELS AND BASES THE CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE HIERARCHY UPON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS AVAILABLE AND SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

LEVEL 1

 QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 2

 OBSERVABLE INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR

SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN INACTIVE MARKETS, OR OTHER INPUTS THAT ARE OBSERVABLE OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

LEVEL 3

 INPUTS THAT ARE GENERALLY UNOBSERVABLE AND TYPICALLY REFLECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS

WOULD USE IN PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.

THE COMPANYS VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND

CERTAIN MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES WERE DERIVED FROM QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. THE VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS DEBT INSTRUMENTS AND ALL OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS, ALL OF WHICH HAVE COUNTERPARTIES WITH HIGH CREDIT RATINGS, WERE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR MODEL DRIVEN VALUATIONS USING SIGNIFICANT INPUTS DERIVED FROM OR CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS, COMPANIES MAY CHOOSE TO MEASURE ELIGIBLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS AT FAIR

VALUE. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR ANY ELIGIBLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE COMPANY MAY SELL CERTAIN OF ITS MARKETABLE SECURITIES PRIOR TO THEIR STATED MATURITIES FOR STRATEGIC REASONS

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANTICIPATION OF CREDIT DETERIORATION AND DURATION MANAGEMENT. THE NET REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY, RELATED TO SUCH SALES, WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012. THE MATURITIES OF THE

COMPANYS LONG-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES GENERALLY RANGE FROM ONE TO FIVE YEARS.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2013,

GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES THAT HAD BEEN IN A CONTINUOUS LOSS POSITION FOR 12 MONTHS OR LONGER WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE DECLINES IN MARKET VALUE OF ITS MARKETABLE SECURITIES INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO BE TEMPORARY IN

NATURE AND DOES NOT CONSIDER ANY OF ITS INVESTMENTS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY INVESTS IN HIGHLY-RATED SECURITIES, AND ITS INVESTMENT POLICY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE POLICY GENERALLY

REQUIRES INVESTMENTS TO BE INVESTMENT GRADE, WITH THE PRIMARY OBJECTIVE OF MINIMIZING THE POTENTIAL RISK OF PRINCIPAL LOSS. FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SECURITY IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. WHEN EVALUATING AN INVESTMENT FOR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANY REVIEWS FACTORS SUCH AS THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW ITS COST BASIS, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER AND ANY CHANGES THERETO, CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES,

AND THE COMPANYS INTENT TO SELL, OR WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT IT WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT BEFORE RECOVERY OF THE INVESTMENTS COST BASIS. DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012 THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY SIGNIFICANT

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES TO PARTIALLY OFFSET ITS BUSINESS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE RISK. THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FORWARD

CONTRACTS, OPTION CONTRACTS, SWAPS, OR OTHER DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO OFFSET SOME OF THE RISK ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, ON NET INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ON CERTAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY

CHOOSE NOT TO HEDGE CERTAIN EXPOSURES FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS AND THE PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE HEDGES WILL OFFSET MORE THAN A

PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE OR INTEREST RATES.

FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY IS THE U.S. DOLLAR HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE. THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARIES WHOSE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY IS NOT THE U.S. DOLLAR AND WHO SELL IN LOCAL CURRENCIES MAY HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INVENTORY PURCHASES NOT DENOMINATED IN THE SUBSIDIARIES FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY HEDGES PORTIONS OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUE AND INVENTORY PURCHASES, TYPICALLY FOR UP TO 12 MONTHS.

TO HELP PROTECT THE NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN

OPERATION FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE CHANGES IN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF THESE INVESTMENTS DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES.

THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES.

THE COMPANY

MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS, OPTIONS, OR OTHER INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISK. THESE INSTRUMENTS MAY OFFSET A PORTION OF CHANGES IN INCOME OR EXPENSE, OR CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM DEBT OR INVESTMENTS.

THE COMPANY RECORDS ALL DERIVATIVES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS

IS BASED ON THE HEDGE DESIGNATION. THE EFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN AOCI UNTIL THE HEDGED ITEM IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS ALONG WITH A

CORRESPONDING LOSS OR GAIN RELATED TO THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEM. THE EFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF NET INVESTMENT HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) AS A PART OF THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT.

THE INEFFECTIVE PORTIONS OF CASH FLOW HEDGES AND NET INVESTMENT HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT LINE

ITEM TO WHICH THE DERIVATIVE RELATES.

DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE ARE RECOGNIZED AS A

COMPONENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED, AND DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES OF INVENTORY PURCHASES ARE RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF COST OF SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED COSTS

ARE RECOGNIZED. DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CASH FLOW HEDGES OF INTEREST INCOME OR EXPENSE ARE RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED INCOME OR EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED. THE

COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE TRANSACTIONS HEDGED WITH CASH FLOW HEDGES AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR WITHIN 12 MONTHS AND FOUR YEARS, RESPECTIVELY.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE DE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THE FORECASTED HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL NOT

OCCUR IN THE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN A SUBSEQUENT TWO-MONTH TIME PERIOD. DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES IN AOCI ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECLASSIFIED IMMEDIATELY INTO OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. ANY SUBSEQUENT

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE UNLESS THEY ARE RE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF OTHER TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY SIGNIFICANT NET GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THE LOSS OF

HEDGE DESIGNATION ON DISCONTINUED CASH FLOW HEDGES DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012.

THE GAIN/LOSS RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE FOR FOREIGN

CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT DURING 2014, 2013 AND 2012. THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENT THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND DO NOT INCLUDE CHANGES IN THE RELATED EXPOSURES,

WHICH GENERALLY OFFSET A PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS FOR OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE ONE MEASURE OF THE TRANSACTION VOLUME OUTSTANDING AND

DO NOT REPRESENT THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR MARKET LOSS. THE CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS REPRESENT THE COMPANYS GROSS EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING LOSS ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING OR UNSETTLED IF ALL

COUNTERPARTIES FAILED TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, BASED ON

THEN-CURRENT

CURRENCY OR INTEREST RATES AT EACH RESPECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANYS GROSS EXPOSURE ON THESE TRANSACTIONS MAY BE

FURTHER MITIGATED BY COLLATERAL RECEIVED FROM CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS AND MARKET RISK WILL VARY OVER TIME AS CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES CHANGE. ALTHOUGH THE TABLE ABOVE REFLECTS THE NOTIONAL AND CREDIT

RISK AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT THE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE. THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT OF THESE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TOGETHER WITH THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES, WILL DEPEND ON ACTUAL MARKET CONDITIONS DURING THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENTS.

THE COMPANY GENERALLY ENTERS INTO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO REDUCE CREDIT RISK BY PERMITTING NET SETTLEMENT OF TRANSACTIONS WITH

THE SAME COUNTERPARTY. TO FURTHER LIMIT CREDIT RISK, THE COMPANY GENERALLY ENTERS INTO COLLATERAL SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS THAT PROVIDE FOR COLLATERAL TO BE RECEIVED OR POSTED WHEN THE NET FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FLUCTUATES FROM

CONTRACTUALLY ESTABLISHED THRESHOLDS. THE COMPANY PRESENTS ITS DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES AT THEIR GROSS FAIR VALUES IN ITS CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMPANY RECEIVED $2.1 BILLION OF CASH

COLLATERAL RELATED TO THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS UNDER ITS COLLATERAL SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH WERE RECORDED AS ACCRUED EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2013, THE COMPANY POSTED CASH COLLATERAL RELATED TO

THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS UNDER ITS COLLATERAL SECURITY ARRANGEMENTS OF $164 MILLION, WHICH WERE RECORDED AS OTHER CURRENT ASSETS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WITH CREDIT-RISK RELATED

CONTINGENT FEATURES THAT WOULD REQUIRE IT TO POST ADDITIONAL COLLATERAL AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 OR SEPTEMBER 28, 2013.

UNDER MASTER

NETTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE RESPECTIVE COUNTERPARTIES TO THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, THE COMPANY IS ALLOWED TO NET SETTLE TRANSACTIONS WITH A SINGLE NET AMOUNT PAYABLE BY ONE PARTY TO THE OTHER. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 AND

SEPTEMBER 28, 2013, THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS OF THESE RIGHTS OF SET-OFF ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF COLLATERAL, WOULD BE A REDUCTION TO BOTH DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES

OF $1.6 BILLION AND $333 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING IN NET DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES OF $549 MILLION AND $57 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

AND $36.8 BILLION IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDE FOR ANY RELATED TAX LIABILITY ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE

THE U.S. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS UNDISTRIBUTED INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. WERE GENERATED BY SUBSIDIARIES ORGANIZED IN IRELAND, WHICH HAS A STATUTORY TAX RATE OF 12.5%.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF $69.7 BILLION OF SUCH EARNINGS. THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY RELATED TO THESE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IS ESTIMATED TO BE

APPROXIMATELY $23.3 BILLION.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2013, $137.1 BILLION AND $111.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED.

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS

TAX POSITIONS ARE EVALUATED IN A TWO-STEP PROCESS. THE COMPANY FIRST DETERMINES WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT A TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED

UPON EXAMINATION. IF A TAX POSITION MEETS THE MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD IT IS THEN MEASURED TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF BENEFIT TO RECOGNIZE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE TAX POSITION IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT

THAT IS GREATER THAN 50% LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES AND UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN PAYMENT OR RECEIPT OF CASH WITHIN ONE YEAR AS

NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WAS

$4.0 BILLION, OF WHICH $1.4 BILLION, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2013, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WAS $2.7 BILLION, OF WHICH $1.4 BILLION, IF RECOGNIZED,

WOULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY INCLUDES INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WITHIN THE PROVISION FOR

INCOME TAXES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2013, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF GROSS INTEREST AND PENALTIES ACCRUED WAS $630 MILLION AND $590 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH IS CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS. IN CONNECTION WITH TAX MATTERS, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED INTEREST AND PENALTY EXPENSE IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012 OF $40 MILLION, $189 MILLION AND $140 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO TAXATION AND FILES INCOME TAX RETURNS IN THE U.S. FEDERAL JURISDICTION AND IN MANY STATE AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. DURING THE

FISCAL YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE U.S. INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) CONCLUDED ITS REVIEW OF THE YEARS 2004 THROUGH 2009, WHICH RESULTED IN THE COMPANY REDUCING ITS GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS BY $570 MILLION AND

RECOGNIZING A TAX BENEFIT OF $166 MILLION. THE IRS IS CURRENTLY EXAMINING THE YEARS 2010 THROUGH 2012. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. IN MAJOR STATES AND MAJOR FOREIGN

JURISDICTIONS, THE YEARS SUBSEQUENT TO 1996 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, GENERALLY REMAIN OPEN AND COULD BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT AN ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX

AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IF ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANYS TAX AUDITS ARE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS. ALTHOUGH TIMING OF THE RESOLUTION AND/OR CLOSURE OF AUDITS IS NOT CERTAIN, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT ITS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WOULD MATERIALLY CHANGE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

IN 2012, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PROGRAM TO REPURCHASE UP TO $10 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK BEGINNING IN 2013.

THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO $60 BILLION IN APRIL 2013 AND TO $90 BILLION IN APRIL 2014. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, $67.9 BILLION OF THE $90 BILLION HAD BEEN UTILIZED. THE COMPANYS

SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT OBLIGATE IT TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES. UNDER THE PROGRAM, SHARES MAY BE REPURCHASED IN PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED AND/OR OPEN MARKET TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING UNDER PLANS COMPLYING WITH RULE 10B5-1 UNDER THE

SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED (THE EXCHANGE ACT).

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO FOUR ACCELERATED SHARE REPURCHASE

ARRANGEMENTS (ASRS) WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS BEGINNING IN AUGUST 2012. IN EXCHANGE FOR UP-FRONT PAYMENTS, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS DELIVER SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK DURING THE PURCHASE PERIODS OF EACH ASR. THE TOTAL

NUMBER OF SHARES ULTIMATELY DELIVERED, AND THEREFORE THE AVERAGE REPURCHASE PRICE PAID PER SHARE, WILL BE DETERMINED AT THE END OF THE APPLICABLE PURCHASE PERIOD OF EACH ASR BASED ON THE VOLUME WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON

STOCK DURING THAT PERIOD. THE SHARES RECEIVED ARE RETIRED IN THE PERIODS THEY ARE DELIVERED, AND THE

UP-FRONT

PAYMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET IN THE PERIODS THE PAYMENTS ARE MADE. THE COMPANY REFLECTS THE ASRS AS A REPURCHASE OF COMMON STOCK IN THE PERIOD DELIVERED FOR PURPOSES OF CALCULATING EARNINGS PER SHARE AND AS FORWARD CONTRACTS INDEXED TO ITS OWN COMMON

STOCK. THE ASRS MET ALL OF THE APPLICABLE CRITERIA FOR EQUITY CLASSIFICATION, AND THEREFORE, WERE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

OTHER EMPLOYMENT TAXES, AND REMITTED THE CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES. THE TOTAL SHARES WITHHELD WERE APPROXIMATELY 15.6 MILLION, 15.5 MILLION AND 16.1 MILLION FOR 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE BASED ON THE

VALUE OF THE RSUS ON THEIR RESPECTIVE VESTING DATES AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPANYS CLOSING STOCK PRICE. TOTAL PAYMENTS FOR THE EMPLOYEES TAX OBLIGATIONS TO TAXING AUTHORITIES WERE $1.2 BILLION, $1.1 BILLION AND $1.2 BILLION IN 2014,

LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY ON ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE BASIC WARRANTY PERIOD FOR HARDWARE PRODUCTS IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE BY THE END-USER. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A

90-DAY

BASIC WARRANTY FOR ITS SERVICE PARTS USED TO REPAIR THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY PROVIDES CURRENTLY FOR THE ESTIMATED COST THAT MAY BE INCURRED UNDER ITS BASIC LIMITED PRODUCT WARRANTIES AT THE TIME RELATED REVENUE IS

RECOGNIZED. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING APPROPRIATE ACCRUALS FOR PRODUCT WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL AND

PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANYS TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PRE-EXISTING WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY BASED ON

ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES.

THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS

THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN

INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST IT OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. IN THE

OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS WITH RESPECT TO INDEMNIFICATION OF END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM OR APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR INFRINGEMENT OF THIRD-PARTY

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT COSTS RELATED TO INDEMNIFICATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 OR SEPTEMBER 28, 2013.

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENTS WITH ITS DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO

INDEMNIFY SUCH INDIVIDUALS TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW AGAINST LIABILITIES THAT ARISE BY REASON OF THEIR STATUS AS DIRECTORS OR OFFICERS AND TO ADVANCE EXPENSES INCURRED BY SUCH INDIVIDUALS IN CONNECTION WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. IT

IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF PAYMENTS THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS DUE TO THE LIMITED HISTORY OF PRIOR INDEMNIFICATION CLAIMS AND THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES INVOLVED IN EACH

CLAIM. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE TO REDUCE ITS EXPOSURE TO SUCH OBLIGATIONS, AND PAYMENTS MADE UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS HISTORICALLY HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONCENTRATIONS IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCT

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, A NUMBER OF COMPONENTS ARE CURRENTLY

OBTAINED FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY COMPETES FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE MARKETS FOR MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES AND PERSONAL COMPUTERS. THEREFORE, MANY COMPONENTS USED BY THE

COMPANY, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE SHORTAGE AND SIGNIFICANT PRICING FLUCTUATIONS THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING

RESULTS.

THE COMPANY USES SOME CUSTOM COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMONLY USED BY ITS COMPETITORS, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN

UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE. WHEN A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT USES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL THE SUPPLIERS YIELDS HAVE MATURED OR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY HAS INCREASED. IF THE

COMPANYS SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS FOR A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT WERE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED, OR IF AN OUTSOURCING PARTNER DELAYED SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN

SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES, OR AT ALL, MAY BE AFFECTED IF THOSE SUPPLIERS CONCENTRATED ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO

MEET THE COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS.

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF MANY COMPONENTS; HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE

THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO EXTEND OR RENEW THESE AGREEMENTS ON SIMILAR TERMS, OR AT ALL. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF SUPPLY SHORTAGES AND PRICE INCREASES THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS THAT ARE LOCATED

PRIMARILY IN ASIA. A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF THIS MANUFACTURING IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY A SMALL NUMBER OF OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, OFTEN IN SINGLE LOCATIONS. CERTAIN OF THESE OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ARE THE SOLE-SOURCED SUPPLIERS OF COMPONENTS AND

MANUFACTURERS FOR MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WORKS CLOSELY WITH ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ON MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES, THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS WERE

UNABLE TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION COMMITMENTS. THE COMPANYS PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS.

OTHER

OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS

OPERATING LEASES

THE

COMPANY LEASES VARIOUS EQUIPMENT AND FACILITIES, INCLUDING RETAIL SPACE, UNDER NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASE ARRANGEMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY UTILIZE ANY OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. THE MAJOR FACILITY LEASES ARE

TYPICALLY FOR TERMS NOT EXCEEDING 10 YEARS AND GENERALLY CONTAIN MULTI-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS. LEASES FOR RETAIL SPACE ARE FOR TERMS RANGING FROM FIVE TO 20 YEARS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE FOR 10 YEARS, AND OFTEN CONTAIN MULTI-YEAR RENEWAL OPTIONS.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMPANYS TOTAL FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES WERE $5.0 BILLION, OF WHICH $3.6 BILLION RELATED TO LEASES FOR RETAIL SPACE.

RENT EXPENSE UNDER ALL OPERATING LEASES, INCLUDING BOTH CANCELABLE AND NONCANCELABLE LEASES, WAS $717 MILLION, $645 MILLION AND $488 MILLION IN 2014,

2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES HAVING REMAINING TERMS IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).

OTHER COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY UTILIZES SEVERAL OUTSOURCING PARTNERS TO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND TO PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TESTING

OF FINISHED PRODUCTS. THESE OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ACQUIRE COMPONENTS AND BUILD PRODUCT BASED ON DEMAND INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH TYPICALLY COVERS PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS. THE COMPANY ALSO OBTAINS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS

FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. WHERE

APPROPRIATE, THE PURCHASES ARE APPLIED TO INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS THAT ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE RESPECTIVE SUPPLIER. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING OFF-BALANCE SHEET THIRD-PARTY

MANUFACTURING COMMITMENTS AND COMPONENT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF $24.5 BILLION.

IN ADDITION TO THE OFF-BALANCE SHEET COMMITMENTS MENTIONED ABOVE, THE

COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS OF $3.4 BILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, WHICH CONSISTED MAINLY OF COMMITMENTS TO ACQUIRE CAPITAL ASSETS, INCLUDING PRODUCT TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT, AND COMMITMENTS RELATED TO

ADVERTISING, R&D, INTERNET AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS.

CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND THAT HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY

ADJUDICATED. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THERE WAS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS IN EXCESS OF A RECORDED ACCRUAL, WITH RESPECT TO LOSS CONTINGENCIES. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF

LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN A REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF

MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

APPLE INC.

V. SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD, ET AL.

ON AUGUST 24, 2012, A JURY RETURNED A VERDICT AWARDING THE COMPANY $1.05 BILLION IN ITS LAWSUIT

AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY $930 MILLION. BECAUSE THE AWARD IS NOW SUBJECT TO APPEAL, THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECOGNIZED THE AWARD IN ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

VIRNETX, INC. V. APPLE INC. ET AL.

PROCEEDINGS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 11  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

THE COMPANY REPORTS SEGMENT INFORMATION BASED ON THE MANAGEMENT APPROACH. THE MANAGEMENT APPROACH DESIGNATES THE INTERNAL REPORTING USED BY

MANAGEMENT FOR MAKING DECISIONS AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE AS THE SOURCE OF THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS

PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. THE COMPANYS REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS CONSIST OF THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, GREATER CHINA, JAPAN, REST OF ASIA PACIFIC AND RETAIL OPERATIONS. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCLUDES BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA. THE

EUROPE SEGMENT INCLUDES EUROPEAN COUNTRIES, AS WELL AS INDIA, THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. THE GREATER CHINA SEGMENT INCLUDES CHINA, HONG KONG AND TAIWAN. THE REST OF ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENT INCLUDES AUSTRALIA AND ASIAN COUNTRIES, OTHER THAN THOSE

COUNTRIES INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE RESULTS OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT. EACH OPERATING SEGMENT PROVIDES SIMILAR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SIMILAR

SERVICES. THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE VARIOUS SEGMENTS ARE THE SAME AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1, SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON NET SALES AND OPERATING INCOME. NET SALES FOR GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS ARE GENERALLY

BASED ON THE LOCATION OF CUSTOMERS, WHILE RETAIL SEGMENT NET SALES ARE BASED ON SALES THROUGH THE COMPANYS RETAIL STORES. OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT INCLUDES NET SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, RELATED COST OF SALES AND OPERATING EXPENSES

DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SEGMENT. ADVERTISING EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN THE GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT IN WHICH THE EXPENDITURES ARE INCURRED. OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT EXCLUDES OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AND CERTAIN EXPENSES MANAGED

OUTSIDE THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. COSTS EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE VARIOUS CORPORATE EXPENSES SUCH AS R&D, CORPORATE MARKETING EXPENSES, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, VARIOUS NONRECURRING CHARGES, OTHER

SEPARATELY MANAGED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AND CERTAIN MANUFACTURING PERIOD EXPENSES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT INCLUDE INTERCOMPANY TRANSFERS BETWEEN SEGMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.

SEGMENT ASSETS INCLUDE RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES, AND FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT ALSO INCLUDES CAPITAL ASSETS. SEGMENT ASSETS EXCLUDE CORPORATE ASSETS,

SUCH AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES, VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES, OTHER LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS, MANUFACTURING AND CORPORATE FACILITIES, PRODUCT TOOLING AND MANUFACTURING PROCESS EQUIPMENT, MISCELLANEOUS

CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE, GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS. EXCEPT FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT, CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE NOT REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT BY SEGMENT AND THEREFORE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT

ASSETS AND INSTEAD INCLUDED IN CORPORATE ASSETS. CASH PAYMENTS FOR CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT WERE $484 MILLION, $495 MILLION AND $858 MILLION FOR 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANYS TOTAL DEPRECIATION AND

AMORTIZATION WAS $7.9 BILLION, $6.8 BILLION AND $3.3 BILLION IN 2014, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $441 MILLION, $382 MILLION AND $319 MILLION WAS RELATED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT IN THE RESPECTIVE YEARS. DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION ON

SEGMENT ASSETS INCLUDED IN THE GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

AS THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPAND ITS BUSINESS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

COLLABORATION ACROSS ITS ONLINE, RETAIL AND INDIRECT CHANNELS IS INTEGRAL TO BETTER SERVE ITS CUSTOMERS AND OPTIMIZE ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS. BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015, MANAGEMENT WILL BE ASSESSING BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AND MAKING

DECISIONS ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS, INCLUDING THE RESULTS OF ITS RETAIL STORES IN EACH RESPECTIVE GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY WILL BE CHANGING ITS REPORTABLE SEGMENTS TO ALIGN WITH THE WAY THE BUSINESS IS MANAGED. THE COMPANYS

REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS WILL CONSIST OF THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, GREATER CHINA, JAPAN AND REST OF ASIA PACIFIC OPERATIONS, AND THE RETAIL SEGMENT WILL NO LONGER BE CLASSIFIED AS A SEPARATE REPORTABLE SEGMENT. THE HISTORICAL SEGMENT DATA FOR PRIOR

PERIODS WILL BE RECLASSIFIED TO REFLECT THIS CHANGE BEGINNING IN THE QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER ENDING DECEMBER 27, 2014.

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING

FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF APPLE INC.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF APPLE INC. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2013, AND THE RELATED

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2014. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT.

AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS

EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF APPLE INC. AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2013, AND THE CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF ITS OPERATIONS AND ITS CASH

FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), APPLE INC.S INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (1992 FRAMEWORK) AND

REPORT OF ERNST & YOUNG LLP, INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF APPLE INC.

WE HAVE AUDITED APPLE INC.S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (1992 FRAMEWORK) (THE COSO CRITERIA). APPLE INC.S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY

IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

(1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY

EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, APPLE INC. MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014, BASED

ON THE COSO CRITERIA.

WE ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE

2014 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF APPLE INC. AND OUR REPORT DATED OCTOBER 27, 2014 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION THEREON.

PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE COMPANYS

ASSETS;

(II)

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP, AND THAT THE

COMPANYS RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND

(III)

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF

FINANCIAL OFFICER, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROLS WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE

OBJECTIVES OF THE CONTROL SYSTEM ARE MET. FURTHER, THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS

IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION OF INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. ALSO, ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS IN FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT

TO THE RISK THAT THOSE INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN BUSINESS CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENTS ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULE

13A-15(F) UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT). MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE CRITERIA SET FORTH IN INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (1992 FRAMEWORK). BASED ON THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED THAT ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2014 TO

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GAAP. THE COMPANYS INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, ERNST & YOUNG LLP, HAS

ISSUED AN AUDIT REPORT ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, WHICH APPEARS IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K.
