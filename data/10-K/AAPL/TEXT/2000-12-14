ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE SUBHEADING "SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE

DEVELOPERS" INCLUDED UNDER THE HEADING "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION," WHICH INFORMATION IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE EDUCATION, CREATIVE, CONSUMER, AND

BUSINESS MARKETS. CERTAIN CUSTOMERS ARE ATTRACTED TO MACINTOSH COMPUTERS FOR A

VARIETY OF REASONS, INCLUDING THE REDUCED AMOUNT OF TRAINING RESULTING FROM THE

MACINTOSH COMPUTER'S INTUITIVE EASE OF USE, ADVANCED GRAPHICS CAPABILITIES,

INDUSTRIAL DESIGN FEATURES OF THE COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS, ABILITY OF

MACINTOSH COMPUTERS TO NETWORK AND COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND

ENVIRONMENTS, AND AVAILABILITY OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE. APPLE PERSONAL COMPUTERS

WERE FIRST INTRODUCED TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE LATE 1970S. IN THE UNITED

STATES, THE COMPANY IS ONE OF THE MAJOR SUPPLIERS OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS FOR BOTH

ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOL CUSTOMERS, AS WELL AS FOR COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY

CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY IS ALSO A SUPPLIER TO INSTITUTIONS OF HIGHER EDUCATION

OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL

AND REGIONAL RETAILERS AND CATALOGUERS. DURING 2000, A SINGLE DISTRIBUTOR,

INGRAM MICRO INC., ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 11.5% OF NET SALES. NO OTHER

CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF NET SALES DURING 2000, AND NO INDIVIDUAL

CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF NET SALES IN 1999 OR 1998. THE COMPANY

OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS TO CONSUMERS, CERTAIN EDUCATION CUSTOMERS, AND CERTAIN

RESELLERS EITHER DIRECTLY OR THROUGH ONE OF ITS ON-LINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD.

DURING 2000, NET SALES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY'S ON-LINE STORES TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION.

COMPETITION

THE MARKET FOR THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND SALE OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND

RELATED SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. IT CONTINUES TO

BE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE

DEVELOPMENT, WHICH HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED THE CAPABILITIES AND

APPLICATIONS OF THESE PRODUCTS, AND HAS RESULTED IN THE FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF

NEW PRODUCTS AND SIGNIFICANT PRICE, FEATURE, AND PERFORMANCE COMPETITION.

FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS PLACE MORE RELIANCE

ON THE INTERNET, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT ARE SMALLER,

SIMPLER, AND LESS EXPENSIVE THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE FOR

MARKET SHARE WITH THE

4

COMPANY'S EXISTING PRODUCTS. THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THIS MARKET

ARE RELATIVE PRICE/PERFORMANCE, PRODUCT QUALITY AND RELIABILITY, DESIGN

INNOVATION, AVAILABILITY OF SOFTWARE, PRODUCT FEATURES, MARKETING AND

DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITY, SERVICE AND SUPPORT, AVAILABILITY OF HARDWARE

PERIPHERALS, AND CORPORATE REPUTATION. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY TAKING AND WILL

CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS TO RESPOND TO THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES BEING PLACED ON

ITS PERSONAL COMPUTER SALES AS A RESULT OF INNOVATIONS IN THE WINDOWS PLATFORM.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY

DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MACINTOSH

PLATFORM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PERCEIVED FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN ADVANTAGES OVER

COMPETING PLATFORMS.

FURTHER INFORMATION RELATING TO THE COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS OF THE PERSONAL

COMPUTING INDUSTRY AND THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THAT MARKET PLACE

MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE SUBHEADING

"COMPETITION," INCLUDED UNDER THE HEADING "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION," WHICH INFORMATION IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY

REFERENCE.

RAW MATERIALS

ALTHOUGH CERTAIN COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY

AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, OTHER KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS

AND APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ("ASICS")) ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED

BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME OTHER KEY COMPONENTS, WHILE

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT

TO INDUSTRY WIDE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER

INDUSTRY, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE

CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED

WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IF

THE SUPPLY OF A KEY OR SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT TO THE COMPANY WERE TO BE

DELAYED OR CURTAILED OR IN THE EVENT A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYS SHIPMENTS

OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SHIP RELATED

PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE

COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE

PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE

COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE POTENTIAL RISKS

BY WORKING CLOSELY WITH THESE AND OTHER KEY SUPPLIERS ON PRODUCT INTRODUCTION

PLANS, STRATEGIC INVENTORIES, COORDINATED PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND INTERNAL

AND EXTERNAL MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES AND LEVELS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY

PRACTICE, COMPONENTS ARE NORMALLY ACQUIRED THROUGH PURCHASE ORDERS TYPICALLY

COVERING THE COMPANY'S FORECASTED REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS FROM 30 TO 130 DAYS.

HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EVALUATE THE NEED FOR A SUPPLY CONTRACT IN

EACH SITUATION.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING

VENDORS WHOSE LOSS TO THE COMPANY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE

COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. AT THIS TIME, SUCH VENDORS INCLUDE

ALPHA-TOP CORPORATION, AMBIT MICROSYSTEMS CORPORATION, ATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC.,

DARFON ELECTRONICS CORPORATION, HON HAI PRECISION INDUSTRY CO., LTD., IBM

CORPORATION, LG ELECTRONICS, LUCENT TECHNOLOGIES INC., MATSUSHITA, MITSUBISHI

ELECTRIC CORPORATION, MOTOROLA, INC., NATSTEEL ELECTRONICS PTE LTD., PHILIPS

SEMICONDUCTORS, SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS, AND QUANTA COMPUTER, INC.

FURTHER DISCUSSION RELATING TO AVAILABILITY AND SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCT

MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE SUBHEADING

"INVENTORY AND SUPPLY" INCLUDED UNDER THE HEADING "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT

FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION," AND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT NOTE 9 UNDER THE

SUBHEADING "CONCENTRATIONS IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND

PRODUCT," WHICH INFORMATION IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

BECAUSE THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL

ADVANCES, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT

UPON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY FLOW OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS

AND TECHNOLOGY TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS

AND TECHNOLOGIES AND TO ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS IN THE AREAS OF HARDWARE AND

PERIPHERALS, SYSTEM SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE, NETWORKING AND

COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE AND SOLUTIONS, AND THE INTERNET. THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES, BEFORE ANY CHARGES FOR IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT, TOTALED $380 MILLION, $314 MILLION, AND $303 MILLION IN 2000, 1999,

AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS RIGHTS TO PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS RELATING TO CERTAIN

ASPECTS OF ITS COMPUTER SYSTEMS, PERIPHERAL SYSTEMS, AND SOFTWARE. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY HAS REGISTERED, AND/OR HAS APPLIED TO REGISTER, TRADEMARKS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND A NUMBER OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES FOR

"APPLE-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-", THE APPLE SILHOUETTE LOGO, THE APPLE COLOR LOGO,

"MACINTOSH-REGISTERED TRADEMARK-," AND NUMEROUS OTHER PRODUCT TRADEMARKS. IN

1986, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED OWNERSHIP OF THE TRADEMARK "MACINTOSH" FOR USE IN

CONNECTION WITH COMPUTER PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE OWNERSHIP

OF SUCH PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, AND TRADEMARKS IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ITS

BUSINESS AND THAT ITS SUCCESS DOES DEPEND IN PART ON THE OWNERSHIP THEREOF, THE

COMPANY RELIES PRIMARILY ON THE INNOVATIVE SKILLS, TECHNICAL COMPETENCE, AND

MARKETING ABILITIES OF ITS PERSONNEL.

MANY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR

RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS,

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH

LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. BECAUSE

OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY, CURRENT EXTENSIVE PATENT

COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE CERTAIN

COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY UNKNOWINGLY

INFRINGE EXISTING PATENTS OF OTHERS. THE COMPANY HAS FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN

NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. HOWEVER, NO LITIGATION HAS ARISEN OUT OF ANY OF THESE

CLAIMS THAT HAS HAD, OR IS EXPECTED TO HAVE, AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S

OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ANY

NECESSARY PATENT OR OTHER RIGHTS COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE

TERMS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE

AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL, OR THAT THE COMPANY WOULD PREVAIL IN

ANY SUCH CHALLENGE. THE FAILURE TO OBTAIN NECESSARY LICENSES OR OTHER RIGHTS, OR

LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF SUCH CLAIMS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

THE UNITED STATES REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S LARGEST GEOGRAPHIC MARKETPLACE.

APPROXIMATELY 52% OF THE COMPANY'S NET SALES IN FISCAL 2000 CAME FROM OPERATIONS

INSIDE THE UNITED STATES. FINAL ASSEMBLY OF PRODUCTS SOLD BY THE COMPANY IS

CONDUCTED IN THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA,

CORK, IRELAND, AND SINGAPORE AND BY EXTERNAL VENDORS IN TAIWAN, KOREA, MEXICO,

THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC. MARGINS ON SALES OF

APPLE PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE

COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS,

INCLUDING TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES.

INFORMATION REGARDING FINANCIAL DATA BY GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT IS SET FORTH IN

PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AT NOTE 10, "SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA," WHICH

INFORMATION IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

REGARDING THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS IS SET FORTH IN

PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE SUBHEADING "GLOBAL MARKET RISKS,"

INCLUDED UNDER THE HEADING "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION," WHICH INFORMATION IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

SEASONAL BUSINESS

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER ITS BUSINESS TO BE HIGHLY SEASONAL, IT

HAS HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED INCREASED SALES IN ITS FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL

QUARTERS, COMPARED TO OTHER QUARTERS IN ITS FISCAL YEAR, DUE TO SEASONAL DEMAND

RELATED TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND THE SCHOOL YEAR. HOWEVER, PAST PERFORMANCE

SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY'S FUTURE NET SALES

OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WARRANTY

THE COMPANY OFFERS A LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY ON ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS.

THE WARRANTY PERIOD IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE BY THE END

USER. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A 90-DAY WARRANTY FOR APPLE SOFTWARE AND FOR APPLE

SERVICE PARTS USED TO REPAIR APPLE HARDWARE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, CONSUMERS MAY

PURCHASE EXTENDED SERVICE COVERAGE ON MOST APPLE HARDWARE PRODUCTS IN ALL OF THE

COMPANY'S MAJOR MARKETS.

BACKLOG

IN THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT BACKLOG AT ANY

PARTICULAR TIME IS NOT A MEANINGFUL INDICATION OF ITS FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

IN PARTICULAR, BACKLOG OFTEN INCREASES IN ANTICIPATION OF OR IMMEDIATELY

FOLLOWING NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS BECAUSE OF OVER ORDERING BY DEALERS

ANTICIPATING SHORTAGES. BACKLOG OFTEN IS REDUCED ONCE DEALERS AND CUSTOMERS

BELIEVE THEY CAN OBTAIN SUFFICIENT SUPPLY. BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING, BACKLOG

SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO

ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN LAWS ENACTED FOR THE

PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT HAS TO DATE HAD NO MATERIAL EFFECT UPON THE

COMPANY'S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS, OR COMPETITIVE POSITION. ALTHOUGH THE

COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE BASED ON

THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE

GIVEN SUCH LAWS, OR ANY FUTURE LAWS ENACTED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE

ENVIRONMENT, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, APPLE AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES WORLDWIDE HAD 8,568

EMPLOYEES AND AN ADDITIONAL 3,160 TEMPORARY EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS.

ITEM 2. PROPERTIES

THE COMPANY'S HEADQUARTERS ARE LOCATED IN CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA. THE COMPANY HAS

MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA, CORK, IRELAND, AND

SINGAPORE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, THE COMPANY LEASED APPROXIMATELY 3 MILLION

SQUARE FEET OF SPACE, PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, IN

EUROPE AND THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION. LEASES ARE GENERALLY FOR TERMS OF FIVE TO

TEN YEARS, AND USUALLY PROVIDE RENEWAL OPTIONS FOR TERMS OF THREE TO FIVE

ADDITIONAL YEARS.

THE COMPANY OWNS ITS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN CORK, IRELAND, AND SINGAPORE,

WHICH TOTAL APPROXIMATELY 617,000 SQUARE FEET. THE COMPANY ALSO OWNS A 748,000

930,000 SQUARE FEET OF FACILITIES LOCATED IN CUPERTINO, CALIFORNIA, USED FOR

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND CORPORATE FUNCTIONS. OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE

COMPANY OWNS ADDITIONAL FACILITIES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY 169,000 SQUARE FEET.

FTC INQUIRY-PRADO V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC. (AND RELATED ACTIONS)

IN OCTOBER 1997, APPLE BEGAN CHARGING ALL U.S. NON-EDUCATION CUSTOMERS FOR LIVE

TELEPHONE TECHNICAL SUPPORT BEYOND 90 DAYS AFTER PURCHASE OF APPLE PRODUCTS. IN

LATE 1997, THE FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) COMMENCED AN INVESTIGATION INTO

CUSTOMER COMPLAINTS THAT APPLE'S CHANGE IN TECHNICAL SUPPORT PRACTICES WAS

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST APPLE RELATED TO THIS CHANGE.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1999, THE REGIONAL AND NATIONAL OFFICES OF THE FTC

APPROVED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE COMPANY, AND A SETTLEMENT WAS APPROVED BY THE

COURT IN THREE OF THE CLASS ACTION SUITS. IN NOVEMBER 1999, TWO APPEALS WERE

FILED OBJECTING TO THE SETTLEMENT AND THE SETTLEMENT IS STAYED PENDING

RESOLUTION OF THE APPEALS.

FISCAL 2000 OVERVIEW

SALES

DURING 2000, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A 30% INCREASE IN NET SALES OVER 1999 WHICH

WAS THE RESULT OF A 32% RISE IN MACINTOSH UNIT SALES. THIS INCREASE IN MACINTOSH

UNIT SALES IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED SALES OF IMAC, THE COMPANY'S

MODERATELY PRICED DESKTOP MACINTOSH SYSTEM DESIGNED FOR THE EDUCATION AND

CONSUMER MARKETS, AND THE INTRODUCTION OF IBOOK, THE COMPANY'S CONSUMER AND

EDUCATION ORIENTED NOTEBOOK COMPUTER INTRODUCED AT THE END OF 1999. THE COMPANY

SOLD APPROXIMATELY 2.2 MILLION IMACS IN 2000, AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY

400,000 UNITS OR 22% OVER IMAC UNIT SALES IN 1999. DURING 2000, THE COMPANY SOLD

APPROXIMATELY 545,000 IBOOKS. IBOOK CONTRIBUTED $809 MILLION TO NET SALES DURING

2000. THE COMPANY ALSO EXPERIENCED MODEST GAINS IN COMBINED UNIT SALES OF ITS

PROFESSIONALLY ORIENTED MACINTOSH SYSTEMS, POWERMACS AND POWERBOOKS. GROWTH IN

NET SALES AND UNIT SALES WAS STRONG IN ALL OF THE COMPANY'S GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING

SEGMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN EUROPE AND JAPAN.

PROFITABILITY

THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED IMPROVED PROFITABILITY IN 2000. OPERATING INCOME BEFORE

SPECIAL CHARGES ROSE 61% TO $620 MILLION IN 2000 FROM $386 MILLION IN 1999.

IMPROVED PROFITABILITY WAS DRIVEN BY THE 30% INCREASE IN NET SALES, STABLE

OVERALL GROSS MARGINS IN 2000 AS COMPARED TO 1999, AND A RELATIVELY MODEST

INCREASE IN OPERATING EXPENSES BEFORE SPECIAL CHARGES OF 18%.

OPERATING TRENDS

DESPITE OVERALL INCREASES DURING 2000 IN NET SALES, UNIT SALES, AND

PROFITABILITY, THE COMPANY'S PERFORMANCE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2000

WAS DISAPPOINTING. NET SALES DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER FELL SHORT OF THE

COMPANY'S EXPECTATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $180 MILLION CAUSING OPERATING MARGIN

BEFORE SPECIAL CHARGES TO FALL TO 4% FOR THE QUARTER AS COMPARED TO THE 9%

EXPERIENCED DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2000. THE FOURTH QUARTER

REVENUE SHORTFALL WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THREE FACTORS. FIRST, FOURTH

QUARTER NET SALES

12

OF THE G4 CUBE, A NEW MACINTOSH SYSTEM ANNOUNCED AND INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, DID NOT MEET THE COMPANY'S EXPECTATIONS. IN

COMBINATION WITH RELATED DISPLAYS, G4 CUBE SALES WERE APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION

SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS. SECOND, NET SALES IN THE COMPANY'S EDUCATION MARKET FELL

SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION. THIRD, ALTHOUGH TOTAL FOURTH

QUARTER POWER MAC UNIT SALES WERE CLOSE TO EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED

AN UNANTICIPATED MIX SHIFT TOWARDS LOWER PRICED POWER MAC CONFIGURATIONS

RESULTING IN LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED NET SALES FOR THE QUARTER OF APPROXIMATELY

$30 MILLION. THE COMPANY ENDED 2000 WITH SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVENTORY IN ITS

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAN PLANNED DUE TO THE LOWER THAN EXPECTED SELL-THROUGH

OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER.

OUTLOOK

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES A SIGNIFICANT SEQUENTIAL DECLINE IN QUARTERLY

NET SALES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2001 TO APPROXIMATELY

$1.0 BILLION. THIS DECLINE IS ANTICIPATED BECAUSE OF A CONTINUED DETERIORATION

IN DEMAND EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE FIRST TWO MONTHS OF FISCAL 2001,

REBATE PROGRAMS AND PRICE CUTS INSTITUTED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER THAT WILL

COST THE COMPANY APPROXIMATELY $135 MILLION, AND A PLAN TO REDUCE SUBSTANTIALLY

BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER THE LEVEL OF INVENTORY IN THE COMPANY'S

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FROM THE AMOUNTS AT THE END OF FISCAL 2000. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCUR APPROXIMATELY $115 MILLION OF CANCELLATION CHARGES

RELATED TO PURCHASE ORDERS FOR PROPRIETARY COMPONENTS DUE TO THE REDUCED SALES

OUTLOOK. AS A RESULT OF THESE FACTORS, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES REPORTING A NET

LOSS, BEFORE THE EFFECT OF ANY INVESTMENT GAINS, IN THE RANGE OF $225 MILLION TO

$250 MILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001.

FOR ALL OF 2001, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES NET SALES WILL DECLINE AS COMPARED TO

2000, FALLING IN THE RANGE OF $6.0 BILLION TO $6.5 BILLION. THE COMPANY

CURRENTLY EXPECTS THAT IT WILL BE PROFITABLE, BEFORE THE EFFECT OF ANY

INVESTMENT GAINS, DURING EACH OF THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF 2001.

THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE COMPANY'S ANTICIPATED OPERATING RESULTS

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001 AND THE COMPANY'S ANTICIPATED OPERATING RESULT

FOR ALL OF 2001 ARE FORWARD-LOOKING. THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE DEPENDENT

UPON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MARKET CONDITIONS WITHIN THE PC INDUSTRY, AND

THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE, AND MARKET

TECHNOLOGICALLY INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO MEET THE DYNAMIC CONDITIONS

WITHIN THE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS. SOME OF THE

POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE

OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE DISCUSSED THROUGHOUT THIS ITEM 7,

INCLUDING THE DISCUSSION UNDER THE HEADING "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION."

------------------------

(A) UNIT SALES FIGURES FOR IMAC IN 1998 INCLUDE SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PREVIOUS

CONSUMER AND EDUCATION ORIENTED MACINTOSH PRODUCTS.

NET SALES ROSE 30% TO A TOTAL OF $7.983 BILLION IN 2000 AS COMPARED TO 1999. THE

INCREASE IN NET SALES RESULTED DIRECTLY FROM A 32% INCREASE IN MACINTOSH UNIT

SALES. DRIVING UNIT SALES GROWTH WAS A 51% INCREASE IN COMBINED UNIT SALES OF

THE COMPANY'S CONSUMER AND EDUCATION MACINTOSH SYSTEMS, IMAC AND IBOOK, AND A

MODEST INCREASE OF 11% IN COMBINED UNITS SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PROFESSIONALLY

ORIENTED MACINTOSH SYSTEMS. COMBINED UNIT SALES OF IMAC AND IBOOK SYSTEMS

ACCOUNTED FOR 52% OF TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES IN 1999 AND 60% IN 2000. THIS

TREND HIGHLIGHTS THE INCREASING IMPORTANCE TO THE COMPANY OF ITS CONSUMER AND

EDUCATION MARKETS. DURING 2000, THE AVERAGE REVENUE PER MACINTOSH SYSTEM, A

FUNCTION OF TOTAL NET SALES GENERATED BY HARDWARE SHIPMENTS AND TOTAL MACINTOSH

CPU UNIT SALES, OF $1,715 WAS RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM 1999. THIS WAS DUE TO

INCREASED UNIT SALES OF HIGHER PRICED POWER MAC, POWERBOOK, IBOOK, AND G4 CUBE

SYSTEMS OFFSET BY INCREASES IN UNIT SALES OF LOWER PRICED IMAC SYSTEMS.

ADDITIONAL COMMENTS REGARDING NET SALES FOR 2000 MAY BE FOUND ABOVE UNDER THE

HEADING "FISCAL 2000 OVERVIEW."

NET SALES INCREASED $193 MILLION OR 3% TO $6.134 BILLION IN 1999 COMPARED TO

1998. THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF THIS GROWTH WAS AN OVERALL 25% INCREASE IN MACINTOSH

UNIT SALES, WHICH WAS REFLECTIVE OF STRONG UNIT GROWTH IN ALL OF THE COMPANY'S

GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS. OFFSETTING THE RISE IN UNIT SHIPMENTS DURING 1999

WAS A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE REVENUE PER MACINTOSH SYSTEM WHICH FELL 17% TO

$1,739 FROM $2,095 IN 1998. THE DECLINE DURING 1999 IN THE AVERAGE REVENUE PER

MACINTOSH SYSTEM WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER PRICING FOR BOTH IMAC AND POWER MAC

PRODUCTS, WHICH REFLECTS THE CONTINUING OVERALL INDUSTRY TREND TOWARDS LOWER

PRICING. THE DECLINE WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SHIFT IN THE COMPANY'S UNIT

MIX TOWARD LOWER-PRICED CONSUMER PRODUCTS SUCH THAT IMAC UNITS AND COMPARABLE

PRODUCTS COMPRISED 52% OF TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES IN 1999 VERSUS 39% IN 1998.

14

NET SALES DECLINED SEQUENTIALLY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1999 COMPARED TO

THE THIRD QUARTER BY $222 MILLION OR 14%, AND DECLINED $220 MILLION OR 14%

COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD IN 1998. SIMILARLY, MACINTOSH UNIT SALES DECLINED

15% AND 7% DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1999 COMPARED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF

1999 AND THE SAME PERIOD IN 1998, RESPECTIVELY. THE PRIMARY CAUSES FOR THESE

DECLINES IN BOTH NET SALES AND UNIT SALES WERE LOWER THAN PLANNED DELIVERIES OF

POWERPC G4 PROCESSORS FROM MOTOROLA AND PRODUCTION INTERRUPTIONS AT VENDORS

SUPPLYING POWERBOOKS AND IBOOKS EXPERIENCED DURING THE LAST WEEK OF THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 1999 AS A RESULT OF THE EARTHQUAKE IN TAIWAN ON SEPTEMBER 20, 1999.

THE SHORTAGE OF G4 PROCESSORS REDUCED POWER MACINTOSH NET SALES BY APPROXIMATELY

$200 MILLION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1999.

SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE

THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. THE COMPANY'S

GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS INCLUDE THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND ASIA PACIFIC. THE

AMERICAS SEGMENT INCLUDES BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA. THE EUROPEAN SEGMENT

INCLUDES EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. THE JAPAN

SEGMENT INCLUDES ONLY JAPAN, WHILE THE ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENT INCLUDES AUSTRALIA

AND ASIA EXCEPT FOR JAPAN. EACH GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT PROVIDES SIMILAR

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SIMILAR SERVICES. FURTHER INFORMATION

REGARDING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 ON

THIS FORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT NOTE 10,

"SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA," WHICH INFORMATION IS HEREBY

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

AMERICAS

NET SALES AND UNIT SALES IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCREASED 22% AND 24%,

RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2000 AS COMPARED TO 1999. DURING 2000, THE AMERICAS SEGMENT

REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 54% AND 55% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL NET SALES AND TOTAL

MACINTOSH UNIT SALES, RESPECTIVELY. THE GROWTH OF THE AMERICAS' NET SALES IN

2000 WAS INDICATIVE OF STRONG GROWTH IN UNIT SALES OF IMAC AND IBOOK AND

RELATIVELY FLAT UNIT SALES OF PROFESSIONALLY ORIENTED MACINTOSH SYSTEMS.

NET SALES IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCREASED 2% TO $3.527 BILLION DURING 1999 AS

COMPARED TO 1998, WHILE MACINTOSH UNIT SALES INCREASED 22%. THIS FOLLOWED A 5%

DECLINE IN NET SALES IN THE AMERICAS BETWEEN 1998 AND 1997. DURING 1999, THE

AMERICAS SEGMENT REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 57% AND 59% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL

NET SALES AND TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES, RESPECTIVELY. THE RESULTS EXPERIENCED

BY THIS SEGMENT IN 1999 REFLECT THE OVERALL TRENDS EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY

DURING 1999 OF INCREASING MACINTOSH UNIT SALES OFFSET BY DECLINES IN THE AVERAGE

REVENUE PER MACINTOSH SYSTEM.

EUROPE

NET SALES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT INCREASED 38% DURING 2000 DRIVEN BY A 53%

INCREASE IN MACINTOSH UNIT SALES. GROWTH IN UNIT SALES RESULTED FROM A 96%

INCREASE IN COMBINED UNIT SALES OF IMAC AND IBOOK, AND AN INCREASE OF 19% IN

COMBINED UNITS SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PROFESSIONALLY ORIENTED MACINTOSH SYSTEMS.

NET SALES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT INCREASED 2% TO $1.317 BILLION DURING 1999 AS

COMPARED TO 1998, WHILE MACINTOSH UNIT SALES INCREASED 23%. THIS FOLLOWED A 16%

DECLINE IN NET SALES IN THE EUROPE SEGMENT BETWEEN 1998 AND 1997. LIKE THE

AMERICAS SEGMENT, EUROPE'S RESULTS IN 1999 AS COMPARED TO 1998 WERE INDICATIVE

OF STRONG GROWTH IN MACINTOSH UNIT SALES OFFSET BY DECLINES IN THE AVERAGE

REVENUE PER MACINTOSH SYSTEM.

JAPAN AND ASIA PACIFIC

NET SALES IN THE JAPAN SEGMENT INCREASED 57% TO $1.345 BILLION IN 2000 AS

COMPARED TO 1999, WHILE JAPAN'S MACINTOSH UNIT SALES INCREASED 39%. THE FACT

THAT JAPAN'S NET SALES ROSE AT A HIGHER RATE THAN ITS UNIT SALES REFLECTS

SEVERAL FACTORS. FIRST, IMAC UNIT SALES IN JAPAN WERE RELATIVELY FLAT

YEAR-OVER-YEAR. SECOND, UNIT SALES OF IBOOK, WHICH GENERALLY CARRY A HIGHER

PRICE THAN IMAC UNITS AND WHICH WERE FIRST SOLD IN JAPAN DURING 2000, ACCOUNTED

FOR APPROXIMATELY 17% OF JAPAN'S TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES DURING 2000. THIRD,

JAPAN SAW A 43% INCREASE IN COMBINED UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PROFESSIONALLY

ORIENTED MACINTOSH SYSTEMS.

15

THE MAJORITY OF THE INCREASE IN BOTH NET SALES AND UNIT SALES IN THE ASIA

PACIFIC SEGMENT CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO SALES OF THE G4 CUBE AND IBOOK, BOTH OF

WHICH WERE INTRODUCED IN THE REGION DURING 2000.

MACINTOSH UNIT SALES AND NET SALES IN ASIA, PARTICULARLY IN JAPAN, RECOVERED

DURING 1999 FROM THE DECLINES EXPERIENCED IN 1998. NET SALES IN THE JAPAN

SEGMENT INCREASED 17% OR $127 MILLION TO A TOTAL OF $858 MILLION IN 1999 AS

COMPARED TO 1998. MACINTOSH UNIT SALES IN JAPAN INCREASED 35% DURING 1999

COMPARED TO 1998 WHILE MACINTOSH UNIT SALES IN THE ASIA PACIFIC SEGMENT

INCREASED 37%. THE INCREASES IN NET SALES AND MACINTOSH UNIT SALES IN BOTH JAPAN

AND ASIA PACIFIC ARE THE RESULT OF STRONG IMAC SALES EXPERIENCED BY THESE

OPERATING SEGMENTS, STRONG GROWTH IN JAPANESE CONSUMER SALES, AND THE GENERAL

ECONOMIC RECOVERY EXPERIENCED IN THE REGION.

BACKLOG

IN THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT BACKLOG AT ANY

PARTICULAR TIME IS NOT A MEANINGFUL INDICATION OF ITS FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS.

IN PARTICULAR, BACKLOG OFTEN INCREASES IN ANTICIPATION OF OR IMMEDIATELY

FOLLOWING NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS BECAUSE OF OVER-ORDERING BY DEALERS

ANTICIPATING SHORTAGES. BACKLOG OFTEN IS REDUCED ONCE DEALERS AND CUSTOMERS

BELIEVE THEY CAN OBTAIN SUFFICIENT SUPPLY. BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING, BACKLOG

SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO

ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. FURTHER

INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S BACKLOG MAY BE FOUND BELOW UNDER THE

SUBHEADING "PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS" INCLUDED UNDER THE HEADING

"FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION," WHICH

INFORMATION IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

GROSS MARGIN

GROSS MARGIN WAS RELATIVELY STABLE DURING 2000 AS COMPARED TO 1999, DECLINING TO

27.1% DURING 2000 FROM 27.6% DURING 1999. THE HALF POINT DECLINE IS PRIMARILY

THE RESULT OF A SHIFT IN MIX OF UNIT SALES AWAY FROM THE COMPANY'S HIGHER

PRICED, HIGHER MARGIN PROFESSIONALLY ORIENTED MACINTOSH SYSTEMS TOWARDS ITS

LOWER PRICED, LOWER MARGIN CONSUMER AND EDUCATION ORIENTED MACINTOSH SYSTEMS.

ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE RELATIVE STABILITY OF ITS GROSS MARGIN, THE COMPANY

EXPERIENCED RELATIVELY STABLE COMPONENT PRICING DURING 2000 AS COMPARED TO 1999.

GROSS MARGIN INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES DURING 1999 TO 27.6% AS

COMPARED TO 24.9% IN 1998. THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECLINES

IN THE COST OF VARIOUS COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, IMPROVEMENTS IN

MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCIES BROUGHT ABOUT BY SELECTIVE OUTSOURCING OF FINAL

ASSEMBLY OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, IMPROVED DESIGN OF PRODUCTS

LEADING TO LOWER MANUFACTURING AND WARRANTY COSTS, AND RELATIVELY STABLE PRICING

OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS OF 1999. DURING 1999, THE

COMPANY WAS ALSO ABLE TO FULLY REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF ACTIONS TAKEN PRIMARILY

IN 1998 AND 1997 THAT LED TO IMPROVED INVENTORY MANAGEMENT AND A MORE EFFICIENT

DISTRIBUTION MODEL FOR ITS PRODUCTS.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE CURRENT GROSS MARGINS WILL BE MAINTAINED, TARGETED

GROSS MARGIN LEVELS WILL BE ACHIEVED, OR CURRENT MARGINS ON EXISTING INDIVIDUAL

PRODUCTS WILL BE MAINTAINED. IN GENERAL, GROSS MARGINS AND MARGINS ON INDIVIDUAL

PRODUCTS WILL REMAIN UNDER SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD PRESSURE DUE TO A VARIETY OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED INDUSTRY WIDE GLOBAL PRICING PRESSURES, INCREASED

COMPETITION, COMPRESSED PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COST AND

AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIAL AND OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES, AND POTENTIAL

CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT MIX, INCLUDING HIGHER UNIT SALES OF CONSUMER

PRODUCTS WITH LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND LOWER GROSS MARGINS. IN RESPONSE

TO THESE DOWNWARD PRESSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE

PRICING ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITS PRODUCTS. GROSS MARGINS COULD ALSO BE

AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE QUALITY PROBLEMS AND

WARRANTY COSTS AND TO STIMULATE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE

COMPANY'S OPERATING STRATEGY AND PRICING TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANTICIPATED CHANGES

IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OVER TIME; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED IN THE SHORT TERM BY FLUCTUATIONS IN

EXCHANGE RATES.

16

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES FOCUSED INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARE

CRITICAL TO ITS FUTURE GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND

ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ARE

CENTRAL TO THE COMPANY'S CORE BUSINESS STRATEGY. EXPENDITURES ON RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT INCREASED 21% OR $66 MILLION TO $380 MILLION IN 2000 AS COMPARED TO

1999. THIS FOLLOWED A $11 MILLION OR 4% INCREASE IN 1999 AS COMPARED TO 1998.

SPENDING ON R&D; HAS REMAINED AT APPROXIMATELY 5% OF NET SALES DURING EACH OF THE

LAST THREE YEARS. THE OVERALL INCREASE IN R&D; SPENDING OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS

IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO INCREASES IN R&D; HEADCOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY 13% OVER THAT

TIME TO SUPPORT EXPANDED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE

SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURES INCREASED 17% TO

$1,166 MILLION IN 2000 AS COMPARED TO 1999 AND DECREASED TO 15% OF NET SALES IN

2000 FROM 16% IN 1999. THIS INCREASE IN TOTAL EXPENDITURES RESULTED FROM HIGHER

SPENDING FOR PROMOTIONAL AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, INCREASED SALES EXPENSES

RESULTING FROM HIGHER NET SALES, AND A 21% INCREASE IN COMBINED SALES,

MARKETING, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE HEADCOUNT FROM THE END OF 1999 TO THE

END OF 2000.

SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENDITURES INCREASED 10% TO $996 MILLION

IN 1999 AS COMPARED TO 1998 AND INCREASED TO 16% OF NET SALES IN 1999 FROM 15%

IN 1998. THESE INCREASES ARE PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF INCREASED SPENDING ON

MARKETING AND PROMOTIONAL ACTIVITIES THROUGHOUT 1999 AND A 12% INCREASE IN

COMBINED SALES, MARKETING, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE HEADCOUNT FROM THE END

OF 1998 TO THE END OF 1999.

SPECIAL CHARGES

2000 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2000, THE COMPANY INITIATED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

RESULTING IN RECOGNITION OF AN $8 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE. THIS CHARGE WAS

COMPRISED OF $3 MILLION FOR THE WRITE-OFF OF VARIOUS OPERATING ASSETS AND

$5 MILLION FOR SEVERANCE PAYMENTS TO APPROXIMATELY 95 EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATED WITH

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIOUS DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SALES AND MARKETING

FUNCTIONS.

1999 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1999, THE COMPANY INITIATED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

RESULTING IN A CHARGE TO OPERATIONS OF $21 MILLION. THE NET RESTRUCTURING CHARGE

OF $18 MILLION RECOGNIZED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 1999 REFLECTS $3 MILLION

OF EXCESS RESERVES RELATED TO PRIOR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS. THE $21 MILLION COST

OF THESE ACTIONS WAS COMPRISED OF $11 MILLION FOR CONTRACT CANCELLATION CHARGES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSURE OF THE COMPANY'S OUTSOURCED DATA CENTER AND

$10 MILLION FOR CONTRACT CANCELLATION CHARGES RELATED TO SUPPLY AND DEVELOPMENT

AGREEMENTS PREVIOUSLY DISCONTINUED.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 1999, THE COMPANY TOOK CERTAIN ACTIONS TO IMPROVE

THE FLEXIBILITY AND EFFICIENCY OF ITS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS BY MOVING FINAL

ASSEMBLY OF CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS TO THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS. THESE

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS RESULTED IN THE COMPANY RECOGNIZING A CHARGE TO OPERATIONS

OF APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 1999. THE CHARGE WAS

COMPRISED OF $6 MILLION FOR SEVERANCE BENEFITS TO BE PAID TO EMPLOYEES

INVOLUNTARILY TERMINATED, $2 MILLION FOR THE WRITE-DOWN OF OPERATING ASSETS TO

BE DISPOSED OF, AND $1 MILLION FOR PAYMENTS ON CANCELED CONTRACTS. THESE ACTIONS

RESULTED IN THE TERMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 580 EMPLOYEES.

EXECUTIVE BONUS

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2000, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A

SPECIAL EXECUTIVE BONUS FOR THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR PAST

SERVICES IN THE FORM OF AN AIRCRAFT WITH A TOTAL COST TO THE COMPANY OF

APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH IS NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE.

APPROXIMATELY HALF OF

17

THE TOTAL CHARGE IS THE COST OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE OTHER HALF REPRESENTS ALL

OTHER COSTS AND TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BONUS.

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET

NET INTEREST INCOME INCREASED $116 MILLION OR 133% TO $203 MILLION DURING 2000

AS COMPARED TO 1999. THIS INCREASE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THREE PRINCIPAL FACTORS.

FIRST, THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

INCREASED $801 MILLION OR 25% DURING 2000. SECOND, THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST

RATE EARNED BY THE COMPANY ON ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

INCREASED TO 6.55% AS OF THE END OF 2000 COMPARED TO 5.38% AT THE END OF 1999.

THE COMBINATION OF THESE FIRST TWO FACTORS INCREASED INTEREST INCOME DURING 2000

BY $66 MILLION. THIRD, INTEREST EXPENSE DECLINED $26 MILLION DURING 2000 AS A

RESULT OF THE CONVERSION OF APPROXIMATELY $661 MILLION OF THE COMPANY'S

CONVERTIBLE SUBORDINATED NOTES TO COMMON STOCK DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 1999.

DURING 1999, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A $59 MILLION INCREASE IN NET INTEREST

INCOME, PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF HIGHER CASH AND INVESTMENT BALANCES, AND BY

DECREASED INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONVERSION OF THE CONVERTIBLE

SUBORDINATED NOTES DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 1999.

GAIN FROM SALE OF INVESTMENT

THE COMPANY HOLDS A SIGNIFICANT EQUITY INVESTMENT IN ARM HOLDINGS PLC (ARM), A

PUBLICLY HELD COMPANY IN THE UNITED KINGDOM INVOLVED IN THE DESIGN AND LICENSING

OF HIGH PERFORMANCE MICROPROCESSORS AND RELATED TECHNOLOGY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2000, THE COMPANY HOLDS 34.8 MILLION SHARES OF ARM STOCK VALUED AT

$383 MILLION.

DURING 2000, THE COMPANY SOLD A TOTAL OF 45.2 MILLION SHARES OF ARM STOCK FOR

NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $372 MILLION, RECORDED A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF

APPROXIMATELY $367 MILLION, AND RECOGNIZED RELATED INCOME TAX OF APPROXIMATELY

$94 MILLION. DURING 1999, THE COMPANY SOLD A TOTAL OF 163 MILLION SHARES OF ARM

STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF APPROXIMATELY $245 MILLION, RECORDED A GAIN BEFORE

TAXES OF APPROXIMATELY $230 MILLION, AND RECOGNIZED RELATED INCOME TAX OF

APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION.

DURING 1998, ARM COMPLETED AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF ITS STOCK ON THE LONDON

STOCK EXCHANGE AND THE NASDAQ NATIONAL MARKET. THE COMPANY SOLD 18.9% OF THE

SHARES IT HELD IN ARM AT THAT TIME FOR A GAIN BEFORE FOREIGN TAXES OF

APPROXIMATELY $24 MILLION. THE COMPANY ALSO RECOGNIZED DURING 1998 OTHER INCOME

OF APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION TO REFLECT ITS REMAINING 25.9% OWNERSHIP INTEREST

IN THE INCREASED NET BOOK VALUE OF ARM FOLLOWING ITS INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING.

FURTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT IN ARM AND GAINS

RECOGNIZED RELATED TO THAT INVESTMENT MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K AT NOTE 2 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH

INFORMATION IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, THE COMPANY HAD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARISING FROM

DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TAX LOSSES, AND TAX CREDITS OF $466 MILLION

BEFORE BEING OFFSET AGAINST CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES FOR PRESENTATION ON

THE COMPANY'S BALANCE SHEET. THIS ASSET IS GENERALLY REALIZABLE BASED ON THE

ABILITY TO OFFSET EXISTING DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $33 MILLION WAS RECORDED AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET

FOR THE BENEFITS OF TAX LOSSES THAT MAY NOT BE REALIZED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE

RELATES PRINCIPALLY TO THE OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS ACQUIRED FROM NEXT, THE

UTILIZATION OF WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE INTERNAL

REVENUE CODE. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE REALIZABILITY OF THE

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS QUARTERLY BY ASSESSING THE NEED FOR AND AMOUNT OF THE

VALUATION ALLOWANCE. THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2000 WAS 28% COMPARED

TO THE HIGHER STATUTORY RATE DUE PRIMARILY TO THE REVERSAL OF A PORTION OF THE

PREVIOUSLY ESTABLISHED VALUATION ALLOWANCE AND CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN

EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES WERE PROVIDED.

18

THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) HAS PROPOSED FEDERAL INCOME TAX DEFICIENCIES

FOR THE YEARS 1984 THROUGH 1991, AND THE COMPANY HAS MADE CERTAIN PREPAYMENTS

THEREON. THE COMPANY CONTESTED THE PROPOSED DEFICIENCIES BY FILING PETITIONS

WITH THE UNITED STATES TAX COURT, AND MOST OF THE ISSUES IN DISPUTE HAVE NOW

BEEN RESOLVED. ON JUNE 30, 1997, THE IRS PROPOSED INCOME TAX ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE

YEARS 1992 THROUGH 1994. ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE ISSUES FOR THESE YEARS HAVE BEEN

RESOLVED, CERTAIN ISSUES STILL REMAIN IN DISPUTE AND ARE BEING CONTESTED BY THE

COMPANY. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY

ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JUNE 1998, STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133,

"ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES" WAS ISSUED. SFAS

NO. 133 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AND EXPOSURE DEFINITION. SFAS NO. 133 REQUIRES

AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE ALL DERIVATIVES AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN THE

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND MEASURE THOSE INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE.

DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT HEDGES MUST BE ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE THROUGH INCOME.

IF THE DERIVATIVE IS A HEDGE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE HEDGE, CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE WILL EITHER BE OFFSET AGAINST THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED

ASSETS, LIABILITIES, OR FIRM COMMITMENTS THROUGH EARNINGS, OR RECOGNIZED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL THE HEDGED ITEM IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IN

JUNE 1999, SFAS NO. 137, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES--DEFERRAL OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 133," WAS

ISSUED. THE STATEMENT DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SFAS NO. 133 UNTIL THE

FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2001. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT SFAS NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES," AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2000. NET

OF THE RELATED INCOME TAX EFFECT, THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 133 IS EXPECTED TO

HAVE A FAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT-TYPE ADJUSTMENT TO NET INCOME OF

APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION AND A FAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT-TYPE ADJUSTMENT TO

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $15 MILLION. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT

ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 133 WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE COMPANY'S HEDGING

STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, ITS APPLICATION MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF OTHER INCOME

AND EXPENSE AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

IN DECEMBER 1999, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING

BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 101, "REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS." SAB 101,

AS AMENDED, SUMMARIZES CERTAIN OF THE SEC'S VIEWS IN APPLYING GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES TO REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON REVENUE RECOGNITION ISSUES IN THE ABSENCE OF AUTHORITATIVE

LITERATURE ADDRESSING A SPECIFIC ARRANGEMENT OR A SPECIFIC INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY

WILL ADOPT SAB 101 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2001. ADOPTION OF THIS

GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL

POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, THE COMPANY HAD $4.027 BILLION IN CASH, CASH

EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AN INCREASE OF $801 MILLION OR 25% OVER

THE SAME BALANCES AT THE END OF 1999. DURING 2000, THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY SOURCE

OF CASH WAS $826 MILLION IN CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES. CASH GENERATED

BY OPERATIONS WAS PRIMARILY FROM NET INCOME AND INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE. THE COMPANY'S CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2000 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 1999 INCLUDE $7 MILLION AND $4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

PLEDGED PRIMARILY AS COLLATERAL AGAINST OUTSTANDING DERIVATIVE POSITIONS.

IN ADDITION TO THE NET PURCHASE OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF $936 MILLION, NET

CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES CONSISTED PRIMARILY OF $232 MILLION FOR THE

PURCHASE OF LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING $200 MILLION INVESTED IN EARTHLINK

NETWORK, INC. (EARTHLINK) DISCUSSED BELOW, AND $107 MILLION FOR THE PURCHASE OF

FIXED ASSETS. THESE USES OF CASH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF

ARM SHARES OF $372 MILLION. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

TO INCREASE TO APPROXIMATELY $225 MILLION DURING 2001 TO ACCOMMODATE INFORMATION

SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENTS AND STRATEGIC INITIATIVES.

IN JULY 1999, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PLAN FOR THE COMPANY

TO REPURCHASE UP TO $500 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK. THIS REPURCHASE PLAN DOES

NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES OR ACQUIRE

SHARES OVER ANY SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. DURING 2000, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED A

TOTAL OF 2.55 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF $116 MILLION.

SINCE INCEPTION OF THE PLAN, THE COMPANY HAS REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF

5.05 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT A COST OF $191 MILLION.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS BALANCES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET ITS CASH REQUIREMENTS OVER THE NEXT

TWELVE MONTHS, INCLUDING ANY CASH UTILIZED BY ITS STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN.

HOWEVER, GIVEN THE COMPANY'S CURRENT NON-INVESTMENT GRADE DEBT RATINGS (STANDARD

AND POOR'S RATING AGENCY OF BB AND MOODY'S INVESTOR SERVICES OF BA2), IF THE

COMPANY SHOULD NEED TO OBTAIN SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

SUCH BORROWINGS COULD BE OBTAINED AT FAVORABLE RATES. THE INABILITY TO OBTAIN

SUCH BORROWINGS AT FAVORABLE RATES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, AND LIQUIDITY.

NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY HOLDS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ARM, SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD,

AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC., AND EARTHLINK. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND HAVE

BEEN CATEGORIZED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE REQUIRING THAT THEY BE CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED IN EQUITY AS A

COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ALL REALIZED GAINS ON THE

SALE OF THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME. THE COMBINED FAIR

VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS WAS $786 MILLION AND $339 MILLION AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, AND SEPTEMBER 25, 1999, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES

IT IS LIKELY THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

FURTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY

INVESTMENTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTE 2 OF NOTES

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH INFORMATION IS HEREBY INCORPORATED

BY REFERENCE.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE

COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND

INVESTORS SHOULD NOT USE HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN

FUTURE PERIODS.

COMPETITION

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY

AGGRESSIVE PRICING PRACTICES, DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGINS, FREQUENT

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES,

20

CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT PRICE/PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS, PRICE

SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS, AND A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS. THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE

FUTURE MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY INDUSTRY WIDE PRICING PRESSURES

AND DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON GROSS MARGINS. THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY HAS ALSO

BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITY,

HARDWARE PERFORMANCE, AND FEATURES BASED ON EXISTING OR EMERGING INDUSTRY

STANDARDS. FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS PLACE

MORE RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT ARE

SMALLER AND SIMPLER THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE FOR MARKET

SHARE WITH THE COMPANY'S EXISTING PRODUCTS. SEVERAL COMPETITORS OF THE COMPANY

HAVE EITHER TARGETED OR ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION TO TARGET CERTAIN OF THE

COMPANY'S KEY MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING CONSUMER, EDUCATION, AND DESIGN AND

PUBLISHING. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS HAVE INTRODUCED

OR ANNOUNCED PLANS TO INTRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT MIMIC MANY OF THE UNIQUE DESIGN,

TECHNICAL FEATURES, AND SOLUTIONS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. MANY OF THE

COMPANY'S COMPETITORS HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, AND

TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES, AS WELL AS BROADER PRODUCT LINES AND LARGER INSTALLED

CUSTOMER BASES THAN THOSE OF THE COMPANY. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY'S FUTURE

OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION MAY BE AFFECTED BY OVERALL DEMAND FOR

PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND GENERAL CUSTOMER PREFERENCES FOR ONE PLATFORM OVER

ANOTHER OR ONE SET OF PRODUCT FEATURES OVER ANOTHER.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY MAKER OF HARDWARE USING THE MAC OS. THE MAC OS

HAS A MINORITY MARKET SHARE IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET, WHICH IS DOMINATED

BY MAKERS OF COMPUTERS UTILIZING MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS. THE

COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY

DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MACINTOSH

PLATFORM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PERCEIVED DESIGN AND FUNCTIONAL ADVANTAGES OVER

COMPETING PLATFORMS.

PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS

DUE TO THE HIGHLY VOLATILE NATURE OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY, WHICH IS

CHARACTERIZED BY DYNAMIC CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL

ADVANCES, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUALLY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES

AND ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THE SUCCESS OF NEW

PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET

ACCEPTANCE, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT

TRANSITIONS, THE AVAILABILITY OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR NEW PRODUCTS, THE

EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF INVENTORY LEVELS IN LINE WITH ANTICIPATED PRODUCT

DEMAND, THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN APPROPRIATE QUANTITIES TO MEET

ANTICIPATED DEMAND, AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER

DEFECTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY CANNOT

DETERMINE IN ADVANCE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT THAT NEW PRODUCTS WILL HAVE ON ITS

SALES OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DURING 2001, THE COMPANY PLANS TO INTRODUCE A NEW CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM, MAC

OS X, WHICH WILL OFFER ADVANCED FUNCTIONALITY BASED ON APPLE AND NEXT SOFTWARE

TECHNOLOGIES. INABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY INTRODUCE MAC OS X ON A TIMELY BASIS,

GAIN CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE, OBTAIN THE COMMITMENT OF DEVELOPERS TO TRANSITION

EXISTING APPLICATIONS TO RUN ON MAC OS X, OR ENSURE ADEQUATE

BACKWARD-COMPATIBILITY OF MAC OS X WITH APPLICATIONS AUTHORED FOR PREVIOUS

VERSION OF THE MAC OS, MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

INVENTORY AND SUPPLY

THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THAT

HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE

VALUE AND ACCRUES NECESSARY RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION FEES OF ORDERS FOR

INVENTORIES THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELED. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS INVENTORY

AND RELATED PROVISIONS ARE ADEQUATE, GIVEN THE RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF

PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THE

COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL INVENTORY AND RELATED CHARGES. IN ADDITION,

SUCH CHARGES HAVE HAD, AND MAY AGAIN HAVE, A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S

FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

21

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN

ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S MARKETS ARE VOLATILE AND

SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, THERE IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL

FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND PRODUCE OR ORDER FROM THIRD PARTIES EXCESS OR

INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY

PRACTICE, COMPONENTS ARE NORMALLY ACQUIRED THROUGH PURCHASE ORDERS TYPICALLY

COVERING THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS FROM 30 TO 130 DAYS. THE

COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND

MAY IN THE FUTURE BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO

MANAGE ITS INVENTORY LEVELS AND RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND

PATTERNS.

THE COMPANY ENDED 2000 WITH SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVENTORY IN ITS DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS THAN PLANNED DUE TO THE LOWER THAN EXPECTED SELL-THROUGH OF THE

COMPANY'S PRODUCTS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES

A SIGNIFICANT SEQUENTIAL DECLINE IN QUARTERLY NET SALES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER

OF FISCAL 2001, IN PART DUE TO THE COMPANY'S PLAN TO REDUCE SUBSTANTIALLY THE

LEVEL OF INVENTORY IN ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FROM THE AMOUNTS AT THE END OF

FISCAL 2000 TO MORE NORMAL LEVELS BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER.

MANY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY

THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS OUTSOURCED MUCH OF ITS

TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT. WHILE OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY

LOWER THE FIXED COST OF OPERATIONS, THEY ALSO REDUCE THE COMPANY'S DIRECT

CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT EFFECT SUCH

DIMINISHED CONTROL WILL HAVE ON THE QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF THE PRODUCTS

MANUFACTURED, OR THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE COMPANY TO RESPOND TO CHANGING MARKET

CONDITIONS. MOREOVER, ALTHOUGH ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUCH MANUFACTURERS MAY CONTAIN

PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT, THE COMPANY MAY REMAIN AT LEAST

INITIALLY RESPONSIBLE TO THE ULTIMATE CONSUMER FOR WARRANTY SERVICE OR IN THE

EVENT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS. ANY UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEFECT OR WARRANTY

LIABILITY, WHETHER PURSUANT TO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR

OTHERWISE, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ALTHOUGH CERTAIN COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY

AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, OTHER KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS

AND APPLICATION SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ("ASICS")) ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED

BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME OTHER KEY COMPONENTS

(INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DRAM, TFT-LCD FLAT-PANEL DISPLAYS, AND OPTICAL AND

MAGNETIC DISK DRIVES), WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM MULTIPLE

SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY WIDE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING

PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY

UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS

EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES ADDITIONAL

SUPPLIERS. IN SITUATIONS WHERE A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT UTILIZES NEW TECHNOLOGIES,

INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE SUPPLIERS' YIELDS

HAVE MATURED. THE COMPANY AND OTHER PRODUCERS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY

ALSO COMPETE FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES (SUCH AS THE CELLULAR

PHONE AND AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRIES) THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR

THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST

OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY (INCLUDING CERTAIN MICROPROCESSORS AND ASICS).

CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO

DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMPONENTS OTHER THAN THOSE

CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY COMPONENT

WERE TO BE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED ON A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT, THE COMPANY'S

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED,

DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL

SOURCE, OR, IF POSSIBLE, TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN

ALTERNATE SOURCE.

THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PRODUCE AND MARKET COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS IS ALSO

DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY AND DESIRE OF IBM AND MOTOROLA, THE SOLE SUPPLIERS OF

THE POWERPC RISC-BASED MICROPROCESSOR FOR THE COMPANY'S MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, TO

PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF MICROPROCESSORS WITH

PRICE/PERFORMANCE FEATURES THAT COMPARE FAVORABLY TO THOSE SUPPLIED TO THE

COMPANY'S COMPETITORS BY INTEL CORPORATION, AND OTHER DEVELOPERS AND PRODUCERS

OF MICROPROCESSORS USED BY PERSONAL COMPUTERS USING THE WINDOWS OPERATING

SYSTEMS. APPLE HAS BEEN UNABLE TO SHIP MACINTOSH SYSTEMS WITH POWERPC G4

22

MICROPROCESSORS RUNNING ABOVE 500 MEGAHERTZ SINCE SUCH SYSTEMS WERE FIRST

ANNOUNCED IN AUGUST OF 1999 DUE TO ITS G4 MICROPROCESSOR SUPPLIER'S INABILITY TO

PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH FASTER G4 MICROPROCESSORS. SIMILAR BUT LESS PRONOUNCED

SUPPLY ISSUES HAVE ALSO ARISEN WITH THE COMPANY'S SUPPLY OF FASTER POWERPC G3

MICROPROCESSORS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THIS INABILITY TO OBTAIN FASTER

MICROPROCESSORS HAD AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

DURING 2000, PARTICULARLY TOWARDS THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY HAS

BEEN INFORMED BY ITS SUPPLIERS THAT FASTER MICROPROCESSORS WILL BE AVAILABLE IN

SUFFICIENT QUANTITY BEGINNING IN THE FIRST HALF OF CALENDAR 2001. HOWEVER, NO

ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH FASTER MICROPROCESSORS WILL ACTUALLY BE

AVAILABLE OR BE AVAILABLE IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES, AND THE INABILITY OF THE

COMPANY TO OBTAIN FASTER MICROPROCESSORS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES DURING 2001

MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

FURTHER DISCUSSION RELATING TO AVAILABILITY AND SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCT

MAY BE FOUND IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING "RAW

MATERIALS," AND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT NOTE 9 UNDER THE SUBHEADING "CONCENTRATIONS

IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCT," WHICH INFORMATION

IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

EDUCATION MARKET

SEVERAL COMPETITORS OF THE COMPANY HAVE EITHER TARGETED OR ANNOUNCED THEIR

INTENTION TO TARGET THE EDUCATION MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS. AS A RESULT,

THE COMPANY'S OVERALL SHARE OF THIS MARKET HAS DECLINED. ADDITIONALLY, NET SALES

IN THE COMPANY'S EDUCATION MARKET FELL SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS BY APPROXIMATELY

$60 MILLION DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE

COMPANY'S TRANSITION TO A MORE DIRECT SALES MODEL FROM A MODEL HEAVILY DEPENDENT

ON THIRD PARTY SALES AGENTS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS INITIATED A PLAN TO

STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION IN THE EDUCATION MARKET, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO INCREASE ITS SHARE OF THE EDUCATION MARKET OR

MAINTAIN ITS EXISTING SHARE OF THAT MARKET. FAILURE TO INCREASE OR MAINTAIN

MARKET SHARE IN THE EDUCATION MARKET MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S

OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL

AND REGIONAL RETAILERS AND CATALOGUERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS MANY

OF ITS PRODUCTS AND RESELLS CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR

MARKETS TO CONSUMERS, CERTAIN EDUCATION CUSTOMERS, AND CERTAIN RESELLERS EITHER

DIRECTLY OR THROUGH ITS ON-LINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD. MANY OF THE COMPANY'S

SIGNIFICANT RESELLERS OPERATE ON NARROW PRODUCT MARGINS, AND MAY DISTRIBUTE

PRODUCTS FROM COMPETING MANUFACTURERS. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL

RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THESE

RESELLERS WEAKENED, IF RESELLERS WITHIN CONSUMER CHANNELS WERE TO CEASE

DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, OR IF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING DEMAND FOR

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS CAUSED RESELLERS TO REDUCE THEIR ORDERING AND MARKETING

OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS.

FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION

MAY BE FOUND IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING "MARKETS AND

DISTRIBUTION," WHICH INFORMATION IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

GLOBAL MARKET RISKS

A LARGE PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM ITS INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL

ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND LABOR CONDITIONS, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, TAX

LAWS (INCLUDING U.S. TAXES ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES), AND CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF

THE U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS THE LOCAL CURRENCY IN WHICH THE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AND

GOODS AND SERVICES ARE PURCHASED. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY EXPOSURE

TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATE TO NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED

SALES IN EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, AND CERTAIN PARTS OF ASIA AND

NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED OPERATING EXPENSES INCURRED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

WEAKNESSES IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PARTICULARLY THE JAPANESE YEN

23

AND THE EURO, CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS

AND THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES.

CONVERSELY, STRENGTHENING IN THESE AND OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCIES CAN EFFECT THE

COST TO THE COMPANY OF PRODUCT COMPONENTS, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE COMPANY'S

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FURTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL MARKET RISKS MAY BE FOUND IN

PART II, ITEM 7A OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE SUBHEADING "FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK"

AND MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTES 1 AND 2 OF NOTES

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH INFORMATION IS HEREBY INCORPORATED

BY REFERENCE.

SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DECISIONS BY CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANY'S

PERSONAL COMPUTERS, AS OPPOSED TO WINDOWS-BASED SYSTEMS, ARE OFTEN BASED ON THE

AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE FOR PARTICULAR APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY

ALSO BELIEVES THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR THE

COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN PART ON THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS'

PERCEPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING, MAINTAINING, AND

UPGRADING SUCH SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VERSUS SOFTWARE FOR THE

LARGER WINDOWS MARKET. THIS ANALYSIS IS BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE PERCEIVED

STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTS, THE ANTICIPATED POTENTIAL REVENUE THAT

MAY BE GENERATED, AND THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING SUCH SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. TO THE

EXTENT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL LOSSES IN PRIOR YEARS AND THE MINORITY MARKET

SHARE HELD BY THE COMPANY IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET, AS WELL AS THE

COMPANY'S DECISION TO END ITS MAC OS LICENSING PROGRAM, HAVE CAUSED SOFTWARE

DEVELOPERS TO QUESTION THE COMPANY'S PROSPECTS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET,

DEVELOPERS COULD BE LESS INCLINED TO DEVELOP NEW APPLICATION SOFTWARE OR UPGRADE

EXISTING SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND MORE INCLINED TO DEVOTE THEIR

RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING AND UPGRADING SOFTWARE FOR THE LARGER WINDOWS MARKET. IN

ADDITION, PAST AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT BY THE COMPANY OF ITS OWN SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS AND SOLUTIONS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DECISION OF SOFTWARE

DEVELOPERS TO DEVELOP, MAINTAIN, AND UPGRADE SIMILAR OR COMPETITIVE SOFTWARE FOR

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. MOREOVER, THE COMPANY'S CURRENT PLAN TO INTRODUCE MAC OS

X DURING 2001 COULD CAUSE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO STOP DEVELOPING SOFTWARE FOR

THE CURRENT MAC OS, AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS WILL

DECIDE TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE FOR MAC OS X ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL.

IN AUGUST 1997, THE COMPANY AND MICROSOFT CORPORATION ENTERED INTO PATENT CROSS

LICENSING AND TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENTS. IN ADDITION, FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS

FROM AUGUST 1997, AND SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF

MACINTOSH COMPUTERS SOLD BY THE COMPANY, MICROSOFT WILL MAKE FUTURE VERSIONS OF

ITS MICROSOFT OFFICE AND INTERNET EXPLORER PRODUCTS FOR THE MAC OS. ALTHOUGH

MICROSOFT HAS ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO DO SO, THESE AGREEMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE

MICROSOFT TO PRODUCE FUTURE VERSIONS OF ITS PRODUCTS THAT ARE OPTIMIZED TO RUN

ON MAC OS X. THE COMPANY WILL BUNDLE THE INTERNET EXPLORER PRODUCT WITH MAC OS

SYSTEM SOFTWARE RELEASES AND MAKE THAT PRODUCT THE DEFAULT INTERNET BROWSER FOR

SUCH MAC OS RELEASES. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH MICROSOFT

HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANY AND TO ITS EFFORTS TO

INCREASE THE INSTALLED BASE FOR THE MAC OS, THE MICROSOFT RELATIONSHIP IS FOR A

LIMITED TERM AND DOES NOT COVER MANY OF THE AREAS IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES

WITH MICROSOFT, INCLUDING THE WINDOWS PLATFORM. ACCORDINGLY, MICROSOFT'S

INTEREST IN PRODUCING APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR THE MAC OS, INCLUDING MAC OS X,

NOT COVERED BY THE RELATIONSHIP OR FOLLOWING EXPIRATION OF THE AGREEMENTS MAY BE

INFLUENCED BY MICROSOFT'S PERCEPTION OF ITS INTERESTS AS THE VENDOR OF THE

WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM. IN ADDITION, THE MICROSOFT RELATIONSHIP MAY HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPANY'S RELATIONSHIP WITH OTHER

PARTNERS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE BENEFITS TO THE COMPANY OF THE

MICROSOFT RELATIONSHIP WILL NOT BE OFFSET BY THE DISADVANTAGES.

PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

MANY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR

RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS,

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH

LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. BECAUSE

OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES

24

IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY, CURRENT EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID RATE

OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY'S

PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE EXISTING PATENTS OF

OTHERS. THE COMPANY HAS FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE

INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.

HOWEVER, NO LITIGATION HAS ARISEN OUT OF ANY OF THESE CLAIMS THAT HAS HAD, OR IS

EXPECTED TO HAVE, AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ANY NECESSARY PATENT OR OTHER

RIGHTS COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS,

IF AT ALL, OR THAT THE COMPANY WOULD PREVAIL IN ANY SUCH CHALLENGE. THE FAILURE

TO OBTAIN NECESSARY LICENSES OR OTHER RIGHTS, OR LITIGATION ARISING OUT OF SUCH

CLAIMS, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIC, AND CHANNEL MIX

THE COMPANY'S PROFIT MARGINS VARY AMONG ITS PRODUCTS, ITS GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS,

AND ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. AS A RESULT, THE OVERALL PROFITABILITY OF THE

COMPANY IN ANY GIVEN PERIOD WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIC,

AND CHANNEL MIX REFLECTED IN THAT PERIOD'S NET SALES.

INTRA-QUARTER SALES CYCLE

APPLE GENERALLY SELLS MORE PRODUCTS DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF EACH QUARTER THAN

IT DOES DURING EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO MONTHS, A PATTERN TYPICAL IN THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER INDUSTRY. THIS SALES PATTERN CAN PRODUCE PRESSURE ON THE COMPANY'S

INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF A QUARTER AND MAY ADVERSELY

IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PREDICT ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS ACCURATELY.

DEVELOPMENTS LATE IN A QUARTER, SUCH AS LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR THE

COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, AN INTERNAL SYSTEMS FAILURE, OR FAILURE OF ONE OF THE

COMPANY'S KEY LOGISTICS OR COMPONENTS SUPPLIERS, CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE

IMPACTS ON THE COMPANY AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DEPENDENCE ON KEY PERSONNEL

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE AND

AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING THOSE IN TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND

STAFF POSITIONS. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY

ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY IN

THE SILICON VALLEY, WHERE MANY OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEES ARE LOCATED. THERE CAN

BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT AND RETAIN

THE KEY PERSONNEL IT NEEDS. ADDITIONALLY, VOLATILITY OR A LACK OF POSITIVE

PERFORMANCE IN THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO

RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES.

MINORITY INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY HOLDS MINORITY INVESTMENTS IN SEVERAL PUBLIC COMPANIES INCLUDING

SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC., EARTHLINK, AND ARM HOLDINGS

PLC. THE COMBINED FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS WAS APPROXIMATELY

$786 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000. THE COMPANY HAS CATEGORIZED ITS

INVESTMENTS IN THESE COMPANIES AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE REQUIRING THE INVESTMENTS

BE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES NET OF TAXES REPORTED

AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE

IN PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES WHOSE SHARE PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT

VOLATILITY. WHILE THE OVERALL FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THESE INVESTMENTS HAS BEEN

POSITIVE THROUGH THE END OF 2000, ADVERSE CHANGES IN GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS

OR POOR OPERATING RESULTS OF THE UNDERLYING COMPANIES COULD RESULT IN THE

COMPANY'S INABILITY TO ULTIMATELY REALIZE THE GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CARRYING

VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS. PERMANENT IMPAIRMENT IN THE VALUE OF ONE OR ALL OF

THESE INVESTMENTS COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY TO RECOGNIZE A LOSS ON SOME PORTION OF

ITS ORIGINAL $316 MILLION INVESTMENT REMAINING IN THESE FOUR COMPANIES.

EURO TRANSITION

ON JANUARY 1, 1999, ELEVEN OF THE FIFTEEN MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION

ADOPTED THE EURO AS THEIR COMMON LEGAL CURRENCY AND ESTABLISHED FIXED CONVERSION

RATES BETWEEN THEIR EXISTING SOVEREIGN CURRENCIES AND THE EURO. THE EURO IS NOW

TRADED ON CURRENCY EXCHANGES AND IS AVAILABLE FOR NON-CASH TRANSACTIONS. THE

TRANSITION PERIOD FOR INTRODUCTION OF THE EURO ENDS ON JANUARY 1, 2002.

25

THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN STEPS TO EVALUATE INTERNAL SYSTEM CAPABILITIES, REVIEW THE

ABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTION VENDORS TO SUPPORT EURO TRANSACTIONS, AND

EXAMINE CURRENT MARKETING AND PRICING POLICIES AND STRATEGIES IN LIGHT OF THE

EURO CONVERSION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS BEGUN THE PROCESS OF UPDATING ITS

INTERNAL SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES TO ACCOMMODATE FULL TRANSITION TO THE EURO AS THE

TRANSACTION AND REPORTING CURRENCY FOR ITS AFFECTED EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES. THE

TRANSITION TO THE EURO MAY HAVE COMPETITIVE IMPLICATIONS ON THE COMPANY'S

PRICING AND MARKETING STRATEGIES, THE IMPACT OF WHICH ARE NOT KNOWN AT THIS

TIME. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS AT RISK TO THE EXTENT ITS PRINCIPAL EUROPEAN

SUPPLIERS AND CUSTOMERS ARE UNABLE TO DEAL EFFECTIVELY WITH THE IMPACT OF THE

EURO TRANSITION. ADOPTION OF THE EURO AND THE COSTS INCURRED TO PREPARE FOR THAT

ADOPTION ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

ALL ISSUES RELATED TO THE EURO CONVERSION HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED OR THAT ADOPTION

ISSUES IDENTIFIED WILL BE ADDRESSED PROPERLY OR ON A TIMELY BASIS. FAILURE TO

PROPERLY IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH ADOPTION OF THE EURO COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

VOLATILITY OF STOCK PRICE

THE COMPANY'S STOCK HAS EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY AS A RESULT OF

VARIATIONS BETWEEN ITS ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND AS A RESULT

OF ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND ITS COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, THE STOCK

MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED

THE MARKET PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN WAYS THAT HAVE BEEN UNRELATED

TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THESE COMPANIES. THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS

GENERAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK IN THE FUTURE.

OTHER FACTORS

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, ITS CORPORATE

HEADQUARTERS, AND OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN MAJOR

VENDORS, ARE LOCATED NEAR MAJOR SEISMIC FAULTS. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE EVENT OF A

MAJOR EARTHQUAKE.

PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT

THE COMPANY TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES,

THE REQUIREMENT THAT THE COMPANY PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH THE ABILITY TO RETURN TO

THE COMPANY PRODUCT AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND LEAVE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. ALTHOUGH THE

COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE BASED ON

THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE

GIVEN SUCH LAWS, OR ANY FUTURE LAWS ENACTED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE

ENVIRONMENT, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

ITEM 7A. DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

TO ENSURE THE ADEQUACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND

INTEREST RATE HEDGE POSITIONS, AS WELL AS TO MONITOR THE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES

OF THE NON-HEDGE PORTFOLIOS, THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS FOREIGN

EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS, AND ITS INTEREST RATE SWAP, OPTION AND

FLOOR POSITIONS BOTH ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS

UNDERLYING FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE RELATED EXPOSURES, RESPECTIVELY,

FROM BOTH AN ACCOUNTING AND AN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE

EFFECTIVE HORIZONS OF THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE

ANTICIPATORY NATURE OF THE EXPOSURES INTENDED TO HEDGE, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THE AFOREMENTIONED PROGRAMS WILL OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE

ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN EITHER FOREIGN

EXCHANGE OR INTEREST RATES. IN ADDITION, THE TIMING OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR

RECOGNITION OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO MARK-TO-MARKET INSTRUMENTS FOR ANY

GIVEN PERIOD MAY NOT COINCIDE WITH THE TIMING OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE

UNDERLYING ECONOMIC EXPOSURES AND, THEREFORE, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S

OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT SFAS NO. 133 AS

OF OCTOBER 1, 2000. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ADOPTION OF THE NEW

ACCOUNTING STANDARD WILL

26

SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE COMPANY'S HEDGING STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, ITS APPLICATION

MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME.

INTEREST RATE RISK

WHILE THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN MANY OF THE

WORLD'S LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY'S INTEREST INCOME AND

EXPENSE IS MOST SENSITIVE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE GENERAL LEVEL OF U.S. INTEREST

RATES. IN THIS REGARD, CHANGES IN U.S. INTEREST RATES AFFECT THE INTEREST EARNED

ON THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES.

THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES

PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS AND LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND

RELATED DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY PLACES ITS INVESTMENTS

WITH HIGH CREDIT QUALITY ISSUERS AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT

EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE COMPANY'S GENERAL POLICY IS TO LIMIT THE RISK OF

PRINCIPAL LOSS AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF INVESTED FUNDS BY LIMITING MARKET AND

CREDIT RISK. ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR

LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CONSIDERED TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS; INVESTMENTS

WITH MATURITIES BETWEEN THREE AND TWELVE MONTHS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S

INVESTMENTS HAVE MATURITIES LESS THAN 12 MONTHS.

DURING 1994, THE COMPANY ISSUED $300 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.5%

UNSECURED NOTES IN A PUBLIC OFFERING REGISTERED WITH THE SEC. THE NOTES WERE

SOLD AT 99.925% OF PAR, FOR AN EFFECTIVE YIELD TO MATURITY OF 6.51%. THE NOTES

PAY INTEREST SEMIANNUALLY AND MATURE ON FEBRUARY 15, 2004.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS THE PRINCIPAL (OR NOTIONAL) AMOUNTS AND RELATED

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATES FOR THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ITS

LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE LONG-TERM DEBT IS COMPRISED OF $300 MILLION OF

UNSECURED NOTES DESCRIBED ABOVE, WHICH MATURE IN FEBRUARY 2004. THE COMPANY'S

U.S. CORPORATE SECURITIES INCLUDE COMMERCIAL PAPER, LOAN PARTICIPATIONS,

CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, TIME DEPOSITS AND CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES. FOREIGN

SECURITIES INCLUDE FOREIGN COMMERCIAL PAPER, LOAN PARTICIPATION, CERTIFICATES OF

DEPOSIT AND TIME DEPOSITS WITH FOREIGN INSTITUTIONS, MOST OF WHICH ARE

DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THE COMPANY'S CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS HAVE GENERALLY

27

BEEN HELD UNTIL MATURITY. GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES WERE NEGLIGIBLE AS

OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 1999.

DURING THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER MATCH THE COMPANY'S FLOATING-RATE

INTEREST INCOME ON ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH ITS

FIXED-RATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON ITS LONG-TERM DEBT, AND/OR TO DIVERSIFY A PORTION

OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE AWAY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN SHORT-TERM U.S. INTEREST

RATES. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS THAT ARE INTENDED

TO REDUCE THE COST OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT HOLD OR TRANSACT IN SUCH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN

RISK MANAGEMENT.

THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WHICH QUALIFY AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES, GENERALLY REQUIRE

THE COMPANY TO PAY A FLOATING INTEREST RATE BASED ON THE THREE- OR SIX-MONTH

U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AND RECEIVE A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST WITHOUT EXCHANGES OF THE

UNDERLYING NOTIONAL AMOUNTS. THESE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT THE COMPANY'S

FIXED-RATE 10 YEAR DEBT TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT AND CONVERT A PORTION OF THE

FLOATING RATE INVESTMENTS TO FIXED RATE. THE MATURITY DATE OF THE ASSET SWAPS IS

SEPTEMBER 2001 WITH THE REMAINING DEBT SWAPS MATURING IN FEBRUARY OF 2004. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 1999, INTEREST RATE DEBT SWAPS HAD A

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE RECEIVE RATE OF 7.21% AND 6.04%, RESPECTIVELY. THE

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PAY RATE ON THE DEBT SWAPS WAS 6.68% AND 5.45% AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 1999, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2000 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 1999, INTEREST RATE ASSET SWAPS HAD A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE

RECEIVE RATE OF 5.50% AND 5.53%, RESPECTIVELY; AND A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PAY RATES

OF 6.66% AND 5.24%, RESPECTIVELY. THE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE SWAPS

ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED IN INCOME AS A COMPONENT OF INTEREST AND OTHER

INCOME (EXPENSE), NET IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. DEFERRED

LOSSES ON SUCH CONTRACTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2000 AND $5 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 1999.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

OVERALL, THE COMPANY IS A NET RECEIVER OF CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR

AND, AS SUCH, BENEFITS FROM A WEAKER DOLLAR AND IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A

STRONGER DOLLAR RELATIVE TO MAJOR CURRENCIES WORLDWIDE. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN

EXCHANGE RATES, AND IN PARTICULAR A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, MAY

NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S NET SALES AND GROSS MARGINS AS EXPRESSED IN U.S.

DOLLARS.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRIMARILY TO PROTECT AGAINST CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED

TRANSACTIONS, AND PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS. GENERALLY, THE

COMPANY'S PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY OF ITS EXISTING MATERIAL FOREIGN

EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY NOT HEDGE CERTAIN

FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES DUE TO IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE

ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES, AND AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE PREMIUM COSTS OF PURCHASED

FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTION CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND

MARKED TO MARKET THROUGH EARNINGS.

PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS COMPRISE SALES OF THE COMPANY'S

PRODUCTS AND PURCHASES OF RAW MATERIAL, SUB-ASSEMBLIES, AND ASSEMBLED FINISHED

GOODS IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. A MAJORITY OF THESE

TRANSACTIONS ARE MADE THROUGH THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES IN EUROPE, ASIA

(PARTICULARLY JAPAN), CANADA, AND AUSTRALIA. THE COMPANY PURCHASES FOREIGN

EXCHANGE OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH

THESE PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS

FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTION CONTRACTS, IN ORDER TO PARTIALLY FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF

THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTION CONTRACTS. THE TERM OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN

EXCHANGE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, WHETHER FOR FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS,

PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, OR TO PARTIALLY FINANCE THE

FOREIGN RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM, CURRENTLY DOES NOT EXTEND BEYOND SIX MONTHS.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON ACCOUNTING HEDGES OF EXISTING ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE

GENERALLY RECORDED IN INCOME OR SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AGAINST THE LOSSES AND

GAINS ON THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO QUALIFYING

ACCOUNTING HEDGES OF FIRMLY COMMITTED OR PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED

TRANSACTIONS ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE

HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON ACCOUNTING HEDGES REALIZED BEFORE THE

SETTLEMENT DATE OF THE RELATED HEDGED TRANSACTION ARE ALSO GENERALLY DEFERRED

AND RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS NOT ACCOUNTED

FOR AS HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN INCOME AS A COMPONENT OF INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME

(EXPENSE), NET. SOLD INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS DO NOT

QUALIFY AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES. PREMIUMS ASSOCIATED WITH SOLD FOREIGN EXCHANGE

OPTION CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND AMORTIZED OVER THE

LIFE OF THE OPTION.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PROVIDES INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS OUTSTANDING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 AND

SEPTEMBER 25, 1999. THE INFORMATION IS PROVIDED IN U.S. DOLLAR AMOUNTS, AS

CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTRACTS, THE TABLE PRESENTS THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT (AT CONTRACT

EXCHANGE RATES) AND THE

INSTRUMENTS MATURE WITHIN 6 MONTHS. MISCELLANEOUS OTHER CURRENCIES CONSIST

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

APPLE COMPUTER, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES,

AND MARKETS PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERALS FOR SALE

PRIMARILY TO EDUCATION, CREATIVE, CONSUMER, AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE

COMPANY. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE

PREPARATION OF THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM

THOSE ESTIMATES.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 1999, THE COMPANY AMENDED ITS BY-LAWS TO PROVIDE

THAT BEGINNING IN 1999 ITS FISCAL YEAR WOULD END ON THE LAST SATURDAY IN

SEPTEMBER RATHER THAN THE LAST FRIDAY. LIKEWISE, BEGINNING WITH THE FIRST FISCAL

QUARTER OF 1999 EACH OF THE COMPANY'S FISCAL QUARTERS NOW ALSO END ON SATURDAY

RATHER THAN FRIDAY. ACCORDINGLY, ONE DAY WAS ADDED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 1999

SO THAT THE QUARTER ENDED ON SATURDAY, DECEMBER 26, 1998. THESE CHANGES DID NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S REVENUE OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY

QUARTER DURING FISCAL 1999. FISCAL YEARS 1999 AND 1998, EACH 52-WEEK YEARS, BOTH

ENDED ON SEPTEMBER 25TH. APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS, THE COMPANY REPORTS A

53-WEEK FISCAL YEAR TO ALIGN ITS FISCAL QUARTERS WITH CALENDAR QUARTERS BY

ADDING A WEEK TO ITS FIRST FISCAL QUARTER. CONSEQUENTLY, AN ADDITIONAL WEEK WAS

ADDED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2000. ALL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN IS

BASED ON THE COMPANY'S FISCAL CALENDAR.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS,

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AND ACCRUED LIABILITIES APPROXIMATE THEIR

FAIR VALUE DUE TO THE SHORT MATURITIES OF THOSE INSTRUMENTS.

INVESTMENTS

ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE

DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CONSIDERED TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. INVESTMENTS WITH

MATURITIES BETWEEN THREE AND TWELVE MONTHS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS. INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN TWELVE MONTHS ARE

CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM ASSETS. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE

CLASSIFICATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AT

THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND REEVALUATES SUCH DESIGNATION AS OF EACH BALANCE SHEET

DATE. THE COMPANY'S DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED

AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. THESE SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE, WITH THE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED AS A

COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. THESE UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES INCLUDE ANY

UNREALIZED LOSSES AND GAINS ON INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES

AGAINST THE AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. THE COST OF SECURITIES SOLD IS BASED

UPON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S ASSET AND

LIABILITY MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS THAT

INVOLVE CONTRACTS AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK. THESE

INSTRUMENTS ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO MANAGE FINANCIAL MARKET RISK, PRIMARILY

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK. THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO THESE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS WITH MAJOR INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS UTILIZING

OVER-THE-COUNTER AS OPPOSED TO EXCHANGE TRADED INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

HOLD OR TRANSACT IN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN RISK

MANAGEMENT.

37

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING

INTEREST RATE SWAPS, COLLARS, AND FLOORS, WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER

TO BETTER MATCH THE COMPANY'S FLOATING-RATE INTEREST INCOME ON ITS CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH ITS FIXED-RATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON

ITS LONG-TERM DEBT, AND/OR TO DIVERSIFY A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE AWAY

FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN SHORT-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER

INTO INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS THAT ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE COST OF THE

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRIMARILY TO PROTECT AGAINST CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED

TRANSACTIONS, AND PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS. GENERALLY, THE

COMPANY'S PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY OF ITS EXISTING MATERIAL FOREIGN

EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY NOT HEDGE CERTAIN

FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES DUE TO IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE

ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES, AND AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE PREMIUM COSTS OF PURCHASED

FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTION CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND

AMORTIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE OPTION.

PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS COMPRISE SALES OF THE COMPANY'S

PRODUCTS AND PURCHASES OF RAW MATERIAL, SUBASSEMBLIES, AND ASSEMBLED FINISHED

GOODS IN CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY. A MAJORITY OF THESE

TRANSACTIONS ARE MADE THROUGH THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARIES IN EUROPE, ASIA

(PARTICULARLY JAPAN), CANADA, AND AUSTRALIA. THE COMPANY PURCHASES FOREIGN

EXCHANGE OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH

THESE PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS

FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTION CONTRACTS, IN ORDER TO PARTIALLY FINANCE THE PURCHASE OF

THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTION CONTRACTS. THE TERM OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN

EXCHANGE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, WHETHER FOR FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS,

PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, OR TO PARTIALLY FINANCE THE

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM CURRENTLY DOES NOT EXTEND BEYOND SIX

MONTHS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO

HEDGE CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY LOAN TRANSACTIONS. THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS

EFFECTIVELY CHANGE CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT INTO U.S. DOLLAR

DENOMINATED DEBT, WHICH BETTER MATCHES AGAINST THE COMPANY'S U.S. DOLLAR

DENOMINATED CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS.

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS GENERALLY QUALIFY AS ACCOUNTING

HEDGES IF THEIR MATURITY DATES ARE THE SAME AS THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AND IF

THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS MEET CERTAIN REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY MONITORS ITS

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE POSITIONS ON A REGULAR BASIS BASED ON

APPLICABLE AND COMMONLY USED PRICING MODELS. THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE CHANGES

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND THE CHANGES IN THE UNDERLYING

HEDGED ITEMS IS ASSESSED PERIODICALLY OVER THE LIFE OF THE HEDGED INSTRUMENT. IN

THE EVENT IT IS DETERMINED A HEDGE IS INEFFECTIVE, INCLUDING IF AND WHEN THE

HEDGED TRANSACTIONS NO LONGER EXIST, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES IN INCOME THE CHANGE

IN MARKET VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENT BEGINNING ON THE DATE IT WAS NO LONGER AN

EFFECTIVE HEDGE.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON ACCOUNTING HEDGES OF EXISTING ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE

GENERALLY RECORDED IN INCOME OR SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AGAINST THE LOSSES AND

GAINS ON THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO QUALIFYING

ACCOUNTING HEDGES OF FIRMLY COMMITTED OR PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED

TRANSACTIONS ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE

HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON ACCOUNTING HEDGES REALIZED BEFORE THE

SETTLEMENT DATE OF THE RELATED HEDGED TRANSACTION ARE ALSO GENERALLY DEFERRED

AND RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS.

38

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

GAINS AND LOSSES ON INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS NOT ACCOUNTED

FOR AS HEDGES ARE RECORDED IN INCOME AS A COMPONENT OF INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME

(EXPENSE), NET. SOLD INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS DO NOT

QUALIFY AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES. PREMIUMS ASSOCIATED WITH SOLD FOREIGN EXCHANGE

OPTION CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND MARKED TO MARKET

THROUGH EARNINGS.

IN JUNE 1998, STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133,

"ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES" WAS ISSUED. SFAS

NO. 133 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AND EXPOSURE DEFINITION. SFAS NO. 133 REQUIRES

AN ENTITY TO RECOGNIZE ALL DERIVATIVES AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN THE

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND MEASURE THOSE INSTRUMENTS AT FAIR VALUE.

DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT HEDGES MUST BE ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE THROUGH INCOME.

IF THE DERIVATIVE IS A HEDGE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE HEDGE, CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE WILL EITHER BE OFFSET AGAINST THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED

ASSETS, LIABILITIES, OR FIRM COMMITMENTS THROUGH EARNINGS, OR RECOGNIZED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL THE HEDGED ITEM IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. IN

JUNE 1999, SFAS NO. 137, "ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES--DEFERRAL OF THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 133," WAS

ISSUED. THE STATEMENT DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SFAS NO. 133 UNTIL THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2001. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT SFAS NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES," AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2000. NET OF

THE RELATED INCOME TAX EFFECT, THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 133 IS EXPECTED TO HAVE

A FAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT-TYPE ADJUSTMENT TO NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY

$12 MILLION AND A FAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT-TYPE ADJUSTMENT TO OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $15 MILLION. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ADOPTION

OF SFAS NO. 133 WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE COMPANY'S HEDGING STRATEGIES.

HOWEVER, ITS APPLICATION MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE

AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET. IF

THE COST OF THE INVENTORIES EXCEEDS THEIR MARKET VALUE, PROVISIONS ARE MADE

CURRENTLY FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND THE MARKET VALUE.

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED BY

USE OF THE DECLINING BALANCE AND STRAIGHT-LINE METHODS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH ARE 30 YEARS FOR BUILDINGS, FROM 2 TO 5 YEARS FOR

EQUIPMENT, AND THE SHORTER OF LEASE TERMS OR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES FOR

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS.

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE

SOFTWARE ACQUIRED OR DEVELOPED FOR INTERNAL USE IS STATED AT COST AND CLASSIFIED

ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN OTHER ASSETS. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS USING AN ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF NO MORE THAN 5 YEARS.

DURING FISCAL YEAR 2000, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA) STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) 98-1, "ACCOUNTING FOR THE

COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR OBTAINED FOR INTERNAL USE." SOP 98-1

REQUIRES THE CAPITALIZATION OF CERTAIN INTERNAL COSTS INCURRED IN THE

ACQUISITION OR DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE. THE ADOPTION OF SOP 98-1

DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION DURING 2000. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 AND

SEPTEMBER 25, 1999, THE NET CARRYING AMOUNT OF SOFTWARE WAS $106 MILLION AND

$44 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

39

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)

NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE

INTANGIBLES FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF THESE

ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, INCLUDING THE

UNAMORTIZED PORTION OF ANY ALLOCATED GOODWILL, TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS

THE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE. IF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND

CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT

TO BE RECOGNIZED EQUALS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS,

INCLUDING ANY ALLOCATED GOODWILL, EXCEEDS ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. THE

RECOVERABILITY OF ENTERPRISE LEVEL GOODWILL IS ASSESSED WHENEVER THE FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES SUGGEST THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE

RECOVERABILITY OF ENTERPRISE LEVEL GOODWILL BY DETERMINING WHETHER THE

UNAMORTIZED GOODWILL BALANCE CAN BE RECOVERED THROUGH UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS. FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, THE COMPANY HAS MADE NO

MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS EXCEPT THOSE MADE IN CONNECTION

WITH THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 4.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE COMPANY TRANSLATES THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS FOREIGN SALES

SUBSIDIARIES AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE

TRANSLATIONS ARE CREDITED OR CHARGED TO "ACCUMULATED TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT"

INCLUDED IN "ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)" IN SHAREHOLDERS'

EQUITY. THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN MANUFACTURING SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN OTHER

ENTITIES USE THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AND REMEASURE MONETARY

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES, AND INVENTORIES, PROPERTY,

AND NONMONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT HISTORICAL RATES. GAINS AND LOSSES

FROM THESE TRANSLATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT IN 2000, 1999 OR 1998.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT

EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND

COLLECTIBILITY IS PROBABLE. GENERALLY, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME

PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. PROVISIONS ARE MADE CURRENTLY FOR ESTIMATED PRODUCT RETURNS,

PRICE PROTECTION, REBATES, AND OTHER SALES PROGRAMS.

IN DECEMBER 1999, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING

BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 101, "REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS." SAB 101,

AS AMENDED, SUMMARIZES CERTAIN OF THE SEC'S VIEWS IN APPLYING GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES TO REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON REVENUE RECOGNITION ISSUES IN THE ABSENCE OF AUTHORITATIVE

LITERATURE ADDRESSING A SPECIFIC ARRANGEMENT OR A SPECIFIC INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY

WILL ADOPT SAB 101 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2001. ADOPTION OF THIS

GUIDANCE IS NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL

POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WARRANTY EXPENSE

THE COMPANY PROVIDES CURRENTLY FOR THE ESTIMATED COST THAT MAY BE INCURRED UNDER

PRODUCT WARRANTIES WHEN PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED.

ADVERTISING COSTS

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE THE FIRST TIME THE ADVERTISING TAKES

PLACE. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $281 MILLION, $208 MILLION, AND $152 MILLION FOR

2000, 1999, AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 1--SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONTINUED)

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT

COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITALIZATION BEGINNING WHEN A PRODUCT'S TECHNOLOGICAL

FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ENDING WHEN A PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR

RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED SOON AFTER

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. AS A RESULT, COSTS SUBSEQUENT TO

ACHIEVING TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT AND ALL SOFTWARE

DEVELOPMENT COSTS HAVE BEEN EXPENSED.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY MEASURES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION PLANS USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD AND HAS PROVIDED IN NOTE 8

PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES OF THE EFFECT ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE AS IF

THE FAIR VALUE-BASED METHOD HAD BEEN APPLIED IN MEASURING COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO

COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY

DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER

OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD INCREASED TO INCLUDE THE

NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IF

THE DILUTIVE POTENTIAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HAD BEEN ISSUED. THE DILUTIVE

EFFECT OF OUTSTANDING OPTIONS IS REFLECTED IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY

APPLICATION OF THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF CONVERTIBLE

SECURITIES IS REFLECTED USING THE IF-CONVERTED METHOD.

STOCK SPLIT

ON JUNE 21, 2000, THE COMPANY EFFECTED A TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT IN THE FORM OF

A COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF MAY 19, 2000. ALL PER

SHARE DATA AND NUMBERS OF COMMON SHARES HAVE BEEN RETROACTIVELY ADJUSTED TO

REFLECT THE STOCK SPLIT.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS, NET INCOME AND OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME REFERS TO REVENUE, EXPENSES,

GAINS AND LOSSES THAT UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ARE

RECORDED AS AN ELEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY BUT ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET INCOME.

THE COMPANY'S OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS COMPRISED OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES NOT USING THE U.S. DOLLAR AS

THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY AND FROM UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE

SECURITIES CATEGORIZED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. SEE NOTE 2 FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION REGARDING AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

THE COMPANY REPORTS SEGMENT INFORMATION BASED ON THE "MANAGEMENT" APPROACH. THE

MANAGEMENT APPROACH DESIGNATES THE INTERNAL REPORTING USED BY MANAGEMENT FOR

MAKING DECISIONS AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE AS THE SOURCE OF THE COMPANY'S

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, MAJOR CUSTOMERS,

AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS ON A COMPANY-WIDE BASIS IS ALSO DISCLOSED.

THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS FOR OFF-BALANCE-SHEET INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE ONE

MEASURE OF THE TRANSACTION VOLUME OUTSTANDING AS OF YEAR-END, AND DO NOT

REPRESENT THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR MARKET LOSS. THE

CREDIT RISK AMOUNT SHOWN IN THE TABLE ABOVE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S GROSS

EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING LOSS ON THESE TRANSACTIONS IF ALL

COUNTERPARTIES FAILED TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, BASED

ON THEN-CURRENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES AT EACH RESPECTIVE DATE.

THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS AND MARKET RISK WILL VARY OVER TIME AS A

FUNCTION OF INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE BASED ON APPLICABLE AND COMMONLY USED PRICING

MODELS USING PREVAILING FINANCIAL MARKET INFORMATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000

AND SEPTEMBER 25, 1999. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES WHERE JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN

ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE, PRICE QUOTES WERE OBTAINED FROM SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S

COUNTERPARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE TABLE ABOVE REFLECTS THE

NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL, FAIR VALUE, AND CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANY'S

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS, IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE GAINS OR

LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT THE INTEREST RATE AND

FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE. THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY

REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TOGETHER WITH THE GAINS

AND LOSSES ON THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES, WILL DEPEND ON ACTUAL MARKET CONDITIONS

DURING THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENTS.

THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WHICH QUALIFY AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES, GENERALLY REQUIRE

THE COMPANY TO PAY A FLOATING INTEREST RATE BASED ON THE THREE- OR SIX-MONTH

U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AND RECEIVE A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST WITHOUT EXCHANGES OF THE

UNDERLYING NOTIONAL AMOUNTS. THESE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT THE COMPANY'S

FIXED-RATE 10 YEAR DEBT TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT AND CONVERT THE FLOATING RATE

INVESTMENTS TO FIXED RATE. THE MATURITY DATE OF THE ASSET SWAPS IS

SEPTEMBER 2001 AND THE DEBT SWAPS MATURE IN FEBRUARY OF 2004. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 1999, INTEREST RATE DEBT SWAPS HAD A

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE RECEIVE RATE OF 7.21% AND 6.04%, RESPECTIVELY. THE

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PAY RATE ON THE DEBT SWAPS WAS 6.68% AND 5.45% AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, AND SEPTEMBER 25, 1999, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2000 AND SEPTEMBER 25, 1999, INTEREST RATE ASSET SWAPS HAD A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE

TRANSACTION. DEFERRED LOSSES ON SUCH CONTRACTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 AND $5 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 1999.

THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS HEDGES ARE CARRIED

AT FAIR VALUE IN OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES WITH THE GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED

CURRENTLY IN INCOME AS A COMPONENT OF INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET.

THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS

HEDGES ARE ALSO CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

WITH GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED CURRENTLY IN INCOME AS A COMPONENT OF INTEREST

AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET, AGAINST THE LOSSES AND GAINS ON THE HEDGED

TRANSACTIONS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, MATURITY DATES FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE

FORWARD CONTRACTS HELD BY THE COMPANY RANGED FROM ONE TO FIVE MONTHS.

IF THE OPTION CONTRACT IS DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS A HEDGE OF A FIRMLY

COMMITTED TRANSACTION, OR A PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTION, THEN

ANY GAIN OR LOSS IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE OCCURRENCE OF THE HEDGED TRANSACTION.

DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES ON SUCH CONTRACTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, AND SEPTEMBER 25, 1999. IF THE OPTION CONTRACT IS USED TO

HEDGE AN ASSET OR LIABILITY, THEN THE OPTION IS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE IN OTHER

CURRENT LIABILITIES WITH THE GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED CURRENTLY IN INCOME AS A

COMPONENT OF INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE), NET, AGAINST THE LOSSES AND

GAINS ON THE HEDGED TRANSACTION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, MATURITY DATES FOR

PURCHASED FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTION CONTRACTS AND SOLD OPTION CONTRACTS RANGED

FROM ONE TO FIVE MONTHS.

THE COUNTERPARTIES TO THE AGREEMENTS RELATING TO THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS AND

FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE INSTRUMENTS CONSIST OF A NUMBER OF MAJOR

INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. TO DATE, NO SUCH COUNTERPARTY HAS FAILED

TO MEET ITS FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE

THERE IS SIGNIFICANT RISK OF NONPERFORMANCE BY THESE COUNTERPARTIES BECAUSE THE

COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS AND THE CREDIT RATINGS OF SUCH

COUNTERPARTIES, AND LIMITS THE FINANCIAL EXPOSURE AND THE NUMBER OF AGREEMENTS

AND CONTRACTS IT ENTERS INTO WITH ANY ONE PARTY. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT

REQUIRE COLLATERAL FROM COUNTERPARTIES, EXCEPT FOR MARGIN AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE TEN-YEAR INTEREST RATE SWAPS ON THE COMPANY'S TEN-YEAR UNSECURED NOTES.

TO MITIGATE THE CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TEN-YEAR SWAP TRANSACTIONS,

WHICH MATURE IN 2004, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO MARGINING AGREEMENTS WITH ITS

THIRD-PARTY BANK COUNTERPARTIES. THESE AGREEMENTS REQUIRE THE COMPANY OR THE

COUNTERPARTY TO POST MARGIN ONLY IF CERTAIN CREDIT RISK THRESHOLDS ARE EXCEEDED.

THE AMOUNTS HELD IN MARGIN ACCOUNTS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2000.

INTEREST, FOR THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD BEGINNING JUNE 1, 1999, AND AT 101.2% OF

THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, PLUS ACCRUED INTEREST, FOR THE TWELVE MONTH PERIOD

BEGINNING JUNE 1, 2000. ON APRIL 14, 1999, THE COMPANY CALLED FOR REDEMPTION OF

THE NOTES. NOT INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $7 MILLION OF UNAMORTIZED DEBT ISSUANCE

COSTS, DEBENTURES IN AN AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OUTSTANDING TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $661 MILLION AS OF MARCH 27, 1999. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF

1999, DEBENTURE HOLDERS CHOSE TO CONVERT VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING

DEBENTURES TO COMMON STOCK AT A RATE OF $29.205 PER SHARE RESULTING IN THE

ISSUANCE OF APPROXIMATELY 22.6 MILLION SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK.

NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND RELATED GAINS

THE COMPANY HOLDS SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ARM HOLDINGS PLC (ARM), SAMSUNG

ELECTRONICS CO., LTD (SAMSUNG), AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (AKAMAI) AND EARTHLINK

NETWORK, INC. (EARTHLINK). THESE INVESTMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS AS NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND HAVE BEEN

CATEGORIZED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE REQUIRING THAT THEY BE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE

WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED IN EQUITY AS A

COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ALL REALIZED GAINS ON THE

SALE OF THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME. THE COMBINED FAIR

VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS WAS $786 MILLION AND $339 MILLION AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, AND SEPTEMBER 25, 1999, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES

IT IS LIKELY THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

LICENSING OF HIGH PERFORMANCE MICROPROCESSORS AND RELATED TECHNOLOGY. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 25, 1999, THE COMPANY HELD APPROXIMATELY 80 MILLION SHARES OF ARM

STOCK WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $226 MILLION. SHARE DATA FOR ARM PRESENTED IN THIS

FORM 10-K HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ARM'S FOUR-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT IN APRIL

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY RESULTING FROM THE SALE. IT IS THE COMPANY'S POLICY TO

RECORD AN ADJUSTMENT REFLECTING ITS SHARE OF THE CHANGE IN THE INVESTEE'S

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY RESULTING FROM SUCH A SALE AS A GAIN OR LOSS IN OTHER

INCOME. CONSEQUENTLY, THE COMPANY ALSO

COMPANY ANNOUNCED AND BEGAN TO IMPLEMENT SUPPLEMENTAL RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS TO

MEET THE FOREGOING OBJECTIVES OF THE PLAN. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A

$217 MILLION CHARGE DURING 1997 FOR THE ESTIMATED INCREMENTAL COSTS OF THOSE

ACTIONS. ALL MATERIAL RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS CONTEMPLATED UNDER THE PLAN WERE

EMPLOYEES; CANCELING OR VACATING CERTAIN FACILITY LEASES AS A RESULT OF THOSE

EMPLOYEE TERMINATIONS; WRITING DOWN CERTAIN LAND, BUILDINGS, AND EQUIPMENT TO BE

SOLD AS A RESULT OF DOWNSIZING OPERATIONS AND OUTSOURCING VARIOUS OPERATIONAL

FUNCTIONS; AND CANCELING CONTRACTS FOR PROJECTS AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT WERE NOT

CRITICAL TO THE COMPANY'S CORE BUSINESS STRATEGY. THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

UNDER THE PLAN RESULTED IN CASH EXPENDITURES OF $297 MILLION AND NONCASH ASSET

WRITE-DOWNS OF $95 MILLION FROM THE SECOND QUARTER OF 1996 THROUGH

SEPTEMBER 30, 2000. OF THE COMBINED 1996 AND 1997 RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES................................    $306       $75        $20

====       ===        ===

THE FOREIGN PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON FOREIGN PRETAX EARNINGS OF

APPROXIMATELY $1,019 MILLION, $612 MILLION, AND $315 MILLION IN 2000, 1999, AND

1998, RESPECTIVELY. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH

EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND IS

GENERALLY BASED IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. AMOUNTS HELD BY FOREIGN

SUBSIDIARIES WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXATION ON REPATRIATION TO THE

UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FULLY PROVIDE FOR

ANY RELATED TAX LIABILITY ON AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE REPATRIATED, ASIDE FROM

UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE

INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF $755 MILLION

OF SUCH EARNINGS. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY

THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED IF THESE EARNINGS WERE TO BE DISTRIBUTED.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF TAX LOSSES, CREDITS,

AND THE FUTURE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS OF EXISTING ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES AND ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED TAX

RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY

DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, THE COMPANY HAD OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS FOR

FEDERAL TAX PURPOSES OF APPROXIMATELY $54 MILLION, WHICH EXPIRE IN 2012. THIS

DOES NOT INCLUDE APPROXIMATELY $79 MILLION OF REMAINING OPERATING LOSS

CARRYFORWARDS ACQUIRED FROM NEXT, WHICH EXPIRE IN 2009 - 2012, AND THE

UTILIZATION OF WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE INTERNAL

REVENUE CODE. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS FEDERAL CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS AND VARIOUS

STATE AND FOREIGN TAX LOSS AND CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, THE TAX EFFECT OF WHICH IS

APPROXIMATELY $129 MILLION AND WHICH EXPIRE BETWEEN 2001 AND 2015. THE REMAINING

BENEFITS FROM TAX LOSSES AND CREDITS DO NOT EXPIRE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $33 MILLION WAS RECORDED AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET

FOR THE BENEFITS OF TAX LOSSES THAT MAY NOT BE REALIZED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE

RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS ACQUIRED FROM NEXT. THE

NET CHANGE IN THE TOTAL VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN 2000 WAS A DECREASE OF

$27 MILLION. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED

INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX

PLANNING STRATEGIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING NET

FOR THE YEARS 1984 THROUGH 1991, AND THE COMPANY HAS MADE CERTAIN PREPAYMENTS

THEREON. THE COMPANY CONTESTED THE PROPOSED DEFICIENCIES BY FILING PETITIONS

WITH THE UNITED STATES TAX COURT, AND MOST OF THE ISSUES IN DISPUTE HAVE NOW

BEEN RESOLVED. ON JUNE 30, 1997, THE IRS PROPOSED INCOME TAX ADJUSTMENTS FOR THE

YEARS 1992 THROUGH 1994. ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE ISSUES FOR THESE YEARS HAVE BEEN

RESOLVED, CERTAIN ISSUES STILL REMAIN IN DISPUTE AND ARE BEING CONTESTED BY THE

COMPANY. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY

ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS, A DIVIDEND OF $30.00 PER SHARE PER ANNUM, PAYABLE IN

PREFERENCE TO ANY DIVIDEND ON THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE

DIVIDENDS PER SHARE PAID ON THE COMMON STOCK ARE GREATER THAN THE DIVIDENDS PER

SHARE PAID ON THE PREFERRED STOCK ON AN "AS IF CONVERTED" BASIS, THEN THE BOARD

OF DIRECTORS SHALL DECLARE AN ADDITIONAL DIVIDEND SUCH THAT THE DIVIDENDS PER

SHARE PAID ON THE PREFERRED STOCK ON AN "AS IF CONVERTED" BASIS, SHALL EQUAL THE

DIVIDENDS PER SHARE PAID ON THE COMMON STOCK. ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2000,

APPROXIMATELY 74,000 SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK WERE CONVERTED TO 9 MILLION

SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK.

NOTE 8--STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO FOLLOW ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB) OPINION

NO. 25, "ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES," AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS

IN ACCOUNTING FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

SHARES BECAUSE, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, THE ALTERNATIVE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING

PROVIDED FOR UNDER SFAS NO. 123 REQUIRES USE OF OPTION VALUATION MODELS THAT

WERE NOT DEVELOPED FOR USE IN VALUING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK

PURCHASE PLAN SHARES. UNDER APB OPINION NO. 25, WHEN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE

COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS EQUALS THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK

ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED.

PRO FORMA INFORMATION REGARDING NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE IS REQUIRED BY SFAS

NO. 123 AND HAS BEEN DETERMINED AS IF THE COMPANY HAD ACCOUNTED FOR ITS EMPLOYEE

STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN PURCHASES SUBSEQUENT TO

SEPTEMBER 29, 1995, UNDER THE FAIR VALUE METHOD OF THAT STATEMENT. THE FAIR

VALUES FOR THESE OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASES WERE ESTIMATED AT THE DATE OF GRANT

AND BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY, USING A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING

MODEL. THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE FAIR VALUE PER SHARE OF OPTIONS GRANTED DURING 1998

INCLUDES THE EXCESS VALUE OF THE REPRICED OPTIONS GRANTED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR

LESS THE VALUE OF THE RELATED FORFEITED OPTIONS ON THE DATE THE REPRICED OPTIONS

WERE GRANTED. THE ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR EACH OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS AND

THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL WAS DEVELOPED FOR USE IN ESTIMATING THE

FAIR VALUE OF TRADED OPTIONS THAT HAVE NO VESTING RESTRICTIONS AND ARE FULLY

TRANSFERABLE. IN ADDITION, OPTION VALUATION MODELS REQUIRE THE INPUT OF HIGHLY

SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THE EXPECTED STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY. BECAUSE

THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN SHARES

HAVE CHARACTERISTICS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF TRADED OPTIONS, AND

BECAUSE CHANGES IN THE SUBJECTIVE INPUT ASSUMPTIONS CAN MATERIALLY AFFECT THE

FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, THE EXISTING MODELS DO NOT

NECESSARILY PROVIDE A RELIABLE SINGLE MEASURE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN SHARES.

FOR PURPOSES OF PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTIONS

AND SHARES ARE AMORTIZED TO PRO FORMA NET INCOME OVER THE OPTIONS' VESTING

PERIOD AND THE SHARES' PLAN PERIOD. THE COMPANY'S PRO FORMA INFORMATION FOR EACH

OF THE LAST THREE FISCAL YEARS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE AMOUNTS).

CONCENTRATIONS IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCT

ALTHOUGH CERTAIN COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY

AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, OTHER KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS

AND APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, OR ("ASICS")) ARE CURRENTLY

OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME OTHER KEY

COMPONENTS, WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE

AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY WIDE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN

INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE

COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES

ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS.IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT TO THE

COMPANY WERE TO BE DELAYED OR CURTAILED OR IN THE EVENT A KEY MANUFACTURING

VENDOR DELAYS SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY'S

ABILITY TO SHIP RELATED PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN

SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN

SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF

THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON

THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE

COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. FINALLY, SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE COMPANY'S CPUS,

LOGIC BOARDS, AND ASSEMBLED PRODUCTS ARE NOW MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING

PARTNERS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WORKS CLOSELY WITH ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ON

MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES AND LEVELS, THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS WERE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR

PRODUCTION OBLIGATIONS.

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY ADJUDICATED. THE

RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY; HOWEVER, IN THE

OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED

TO ANY LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

70

REPORT OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

UNTIL APRIL 2000, THE MEMBERS OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WERE MESSRS. EDGAR

S. WOOLARD AND GARETH C.C. CHANG. MR. WOOLARD RETIRED FROM THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS IN APRIL 2000 AND THE COMPANY CEASED TO HAVE AN ACTIVE COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM IS

PRESENTLY ADMINISTERED BY THE BOARD. THE BOARD REVIEWS AND APPROVES THE BASE

SALARIES, BONUSES, STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER COMPENSATION OF THE EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS AND MANAGEMENT-LEVEL EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY AND ADMINISTERS THE

COMPANY'S STOCK OPTION PLANS. MR. JOBS WHO IS BOTH A MEMBER OF THE BOARD AND THE

COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN DELIBERATIONS OF THE

BOARD CONCERNING EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION.

THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOCUSES ON COMPANY PERFORMANCE,

INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE AND INCREASES IN STOCKHOLDER VALUE OVER TIME AS

DETERMINANTS OF EXECUTIVE PAY LEVELS. THESE PRINCIPLES ARE INTENDED TO MOTIVATE

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS TO IMPROVE THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY, TO HOLD

EXECUTIVES ACCOUNTABLE FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ORGANIZATIONS FOR WHICH THEY

ARE RESPONSIBLE, TO ATTRACT KEY EXECUTIVES INTO THE SERVICE OF THE COMPANY, AND

TO CREATE VALUE FOR THE COMPANY'S SHAREHOLDERS. THE COMPENSATION FOR EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS IS BASED ON TWO ELEMENTS: CASH COMPENSATION AND EQUITY-BASED

COMPENSATION.

CASH COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY REVIEWS EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION SURVEYS IN BOTH THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY

AND GENERAL INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THAT THE TOTAL CASH COMPENSATION PROVIDED TO

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT REMAINS AT COMPETITIVE LEVELS SO THAT

THE COMPANY CAN CONTINUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL WITH THE

TALENTS AND SKILLS REQUIRED TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

INDUSTRY. THE COMPENSATION OF EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IS REVIEWED ANNUALLY.

BONUSES

FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000, THE BOARD ESTABLISHED A FY00 VICE PRESIDENTS AND DIRECTORS

INCENTIVE BONUS PLAN (THE "BONUS PLAN"), UNDER WHICH CASH BONUSES FOR EMPLOYEES

AT THE LEVEL OF DIRECTOR AND ABOVE WERE DETERMINED BASED ON SPECIFIED REVENUE,

UNIT SHIPMENTS AND PROFIT TARGETS FOR THE COMPANY. BECAUSE THE COMPANY ACHIEVED

THE METRICS SPECIFIED IN THE BONUS PLAN, PAYMENTS WERE MADE THEREUNDER.

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND MEMBERS OF THE BOARD WERE NOT ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN

THE BONUS PLAN AND RECEIVED NO OTHER BONUSES FOR FISCAL YEAR 2000.

EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

IN FISCAL YEAR 2000, THE BOARD EMPHASIZED EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION, PRINCIPALLY

IN THE FORM OF OPTIONS, AS THE CORNERSTONE OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE

COMPENSATION PROGRAM. EQUITY AWARDS ARE TYPICALLY SET BY THE BOARD BASED ON

INDUSTRY SURVEYS, EACH OFFICER'S INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE AND ACHIEVEMENTS, MARKET

FACTORS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS OF MANAGEMENT. IN FISCAL YEAR 2000, EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS WERE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS UNDER THE 1998

EXECUTIVE OFFICER STOCK PLAN ("1998 PLAN"). IN ADDITION, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WERE

ELIGIBLE TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN.

DURING FISCAL YEAR 2000, OPTIONS WERE GRANTED UNDER THE 1998 PLAN TO

MESSRS. JOBS, JOHNSON, AND TAMADDON AND MS. HEINEN. THE OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER

THE 1998 PLAN WERE AT AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE

COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND GENERALLY VEST IN INCREMENTS OVER A

FOUR-YEAR PERIOD AFTER GRANT, SUBJECT TO THE PARTICIPANT'S CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT

WITH THE COMPANY. HOWEVER, THE OPTIONS GRANTED TO MR. JOBS WILL VEST IN FULL IN

JULY 2001. ALL OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE 1998 PLAN EXPIRE TEN YEARS FROM THE

DATE OF GRANT, UNLESS A SHORTER TERM IS PROVIDED IN THE OPTION AGREEMENT OR THE

PARTICIPANT'S EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY TERMINATES BEFORE THE END OF SUCH

TEN-YEAR PERIOD.

71

COMPENSATION OF THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

IN DECEMBER 1999, IN RECOGNITION OF MR. JOBS' OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE OVER THE

PREVIOUS TWO AND A HALF YEARS, THE BOARD AWARDED MR. JOBS A SPECIAL EXECUTIVE

BONUS IN THE FORM OF A GULFSTREAM V AIRPLANE. THE BOARD ANTICIPATES DELIVERING

THE PLANE TO MR. JOBS DURING FISCAL 2001. IN JANUARY 2000, MR. JOBS ACCEPTED THE

POSITION OF CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, WHICH HE HAD PREVIOUSLY HELD ON AN INTERIM

BASIS. THE BOARD AT THAT TIME GRANTED MR. JOBS 20 MILLION OPTIONS UNDER THE 1998

PLAN. MR. JOBS WILL CONTINUE TO RECEIVE A SALARY OF $1 PER YEAR FOR THE SERVICES

HE PERFORMS AS THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER.

SECTION 162(M)

THE COMPANY INTENDS THAT OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE COMPANY'S STOCK OPTION PLANS

BE DEDUCTIBLE BY THE COMPANY UNDER SECTION 162(M) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE

OF 1986, AS AMENDED.
