MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE EDUCATION, CREATIVE, CONSUMER, AND BUSINESS MARKETS. CERTAIN CUSTOMERS ARE ATTRACTED TO MACINTOSH COMPUTERS FOR A VARIETY OF

REASONS, INCLUDING THE REDUCED AMOUNT OF TRAINING RESULTING FROM THE MACINTOSH COMPUTER'S INTUITIVE EASE OF USE, ADVANCED GRAPHICS CAPABILITIES, INDUSTRIAL DESIGN FEATURES OF THE COMPANY'S HARDWARE

PRODUCTS, AND ABILITY OF MACINTOSH COMPUTERS TO NETWORK AND COMMUNICATE WITH OTHER COMPUTER SYSTEMS AND ENVIRONMENTS. APPLE PERSONAL COMPUTERS WERE FIRST INTRODUCED TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE LATE

1970S. OVER 21% OF THE COMPANY'S NET SALES IN 2002 WERE TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING SALES TO ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS AND COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CUSTOMERS. FURTHER

INFORMATION RELATING TO THE U.S. EDUCATION MARKET AND THE COMPANY'S POSITION IN THAT MARKET MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING "FACTORS THAT

MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION."

THE

COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS AND CATALOGUERS. DURING 2000 A SINGLE DISTRIBUTOR, INGRAM MICRO INC., ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY 11.5% OF NET SALES. NO OTHER CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF NET SALES DURING 2000, AND NO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF NET SALES IN 2002 OR 2001. THE

RETAIL STORES IN THE UNITED STATES, OR THROUGH ONE OF ITS ONLINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD. NET SALES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY'S ONLINE STORES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION AND

$2.0 BILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

COMPETITION

THE COMPANY IS CONFRONTED BY AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION IN ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THE MARKET FOR THE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND SALE OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED SOFTWARE

AND PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THIS MARKET CONTINUES TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN BOTH HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT, WHICH HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED

THE CAPABILITIES AND APPLICATIONS OF THESE PRODUCTS, AND HAVE RESULTED IN THE FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SIGNIFICANT PRICE, FEATURE, AND PERFORMANCE COMPETITION. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS PRICE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE. THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS WHO SELL WINDOWS-BASED PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED

THEIR PRODUCT MARGINS TO GAIN OR MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE IN RESPONSE TO WEAKNESS IN DEMAND FOR PERSONAL COMPUTING PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS

10

OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE AND OTHER INDUSTRY WIDE PRICING PRESSURES AND DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON GROSS MARGINS.

THE

PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS INCLUDE RELATIVE PRICE/PERFORMANCE, PRODUCT QUALITY AND RELIABILITY, DESIGN INNOVATION, AVAILABILITY OF SOFTWARE, PRODUCT

FEATURES, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITY, SERVICE AND SUPPORT, AVAILABILITY OF HARDWARE PERIPHERALS, AND CORPORATE REPUTATION. FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS PLACE

MORE RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT ARE SMALLER, SIMPLER, AND LESS EXPENSIVE THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH THE

COMPANY'S EXISTING PRODUCTS.

THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY TAKING AND WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE STEPS TO RESPOND TO THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES BEING PLACED ON ITS PERSONAL COMPUTER SALES AS A RESULT OF INNOVATIONS IN THE WINDOWS PLATFORM.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PERCEIVED

FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN ADVANTAGES OVER COMPETING PLATFORMS.

FURTHER

INFORMATION RELATING TO THE COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTING INDUSTRY AND THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THAT MARKET PLACE MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS

FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION."

RAW MATERIALS

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND

APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ("ASICS")) ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME OTHER KEY COMPONENTS, WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM

MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY WIDE AVAILABILITY CONSTRAINTS AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER INDUSTRY, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE

UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY OR SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT TO THE COMPANY WERE TO BE DELAYED OR

CURTAILED OR IN THE EVENT A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYS SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SHIP RELATED PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE,

OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF

COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE POTENTIAL RISKS BY WORKING CLOSELY WITH THESE AND OTHER KEY SUPPLIERS ON

PRODUCT INTRODUCTION PLANS, STRATEGIC INVENTORIES, COORDINATED PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES AND LEVELS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY

ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF FORMAL PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. THESE FORMAL AND INFORMAL COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER

THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 130 DAYS.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHOSE LOSS TO THE COMPANY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

AT THIS TIME, SUCH VENDORS INCLUDE AGERE SYSTEMS, INC., AMBIT MICROSYSTEMS CORPORATION, ATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC., ELITE COMPUTER SYSTEMS CO., INC., HON HAI PRECISION INDUSTRY

CO., LTD., IBM CORPORATION, INVENTEC APPLIANCES CORPORATION, LG. PHILLIPS CO., LTD., MATSUSHITA, MITSUBISHI ELECTRIC CORPORATION, MOTOROLA, INC., NVIDIA CORP., QUANTA

COMPUTER, INC., SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS, SOLECTRON CORPORATION, AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION.

DISCUSSION RELATING TO AVAILABILITY AND SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCT MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT

FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION," AND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT NOTE 10 UNDER THE SUBHEADING

"CONCENTRATIONS IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCT."

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

BECAUSE THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO

ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY FLOW OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND TO ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS IN THE

AREAS OF HARDWARE AND PERIPHERALS, SYSTEM SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE AND SOLUTIONS, AND THE INTERNET. THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES,

BEFORE ANY CHARGES FOR PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, TOTALED $446 MILLION, $430 MILLION, AND $380 MILLION IN 2002, 2001, AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS RIGHTS TO PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS RELATING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS COMPUTER SYSTEMS, PERIPHERAL SYSTEMS, AND SOFTWARE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS

REGISTERED, AND/OR HAS APPLIED TO REGISTER, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IN THE UNITED STATES AND A NUMBER OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES FOR "APPLE," THE APPLE SILHOUETTE LOGO, THE APPLE COLOR LOGO,

"MACINTOSH," AND NUMEROUS OTHER PRODUCT TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS. IN 1986, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED OWNERSHIP OF THE TRADEMARK "MACINTOSH" FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH COMPUTER PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THE OWNERSHIP OF SUCH PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IS AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ITS BUSINESS AND THAT ITS SUCCESS DOES DEPEND IN PART ON THE OWNERSHIP THEREOF, THE

COMPANY RELIES PRIMARILY ON THE INNOVATIVE SKILLS, TECHNICAL COMPETENCE, AND MARKETING ABILITIES OF ITS PERSONNEL.

MANY

OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS

OF ITS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. BECAUSE OF

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY, CURRENT EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND

BUSINESS METHODS MAY UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE EXISTING PATENTS OF OTHERS. THE COMPANY HAS FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF

OTHERS.

INFORMATION

REGARDING CLAIMS AND LITIGATION INVOLVING THE COMPANY RELATED TO ALLEGED PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND RISKS RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S RELIANCE ON THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS SET FORTH

IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K, AND IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION."

FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

THE UNITED STATES REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S LARGEST GEOGRAPHIC MARKETPLACE. APPROXIMATELY 57% OF THE COMPANY'S NET SALES IN FISCAL 2002 CAME FROM SALES TO CUSTOMERS INSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. FINAL ASSEMBLY OF PRODUCTS SOLD BY THE COMPANY IS CONDUCTED IN THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA, AND CORK, IRELAND, AND BY EXTERNAL VENDORS IN FULLERTON,

CALIFORNIA, TAIWAN, KOREA, THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC. MARGINS ON SALES OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED

FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES.

INFORMATION

REGARDING FINANCIAL DATA BY GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT IS SET FORTH IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT

NOTE 11, "SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA." ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

IS SET FORTH IN PART II, ITEM 7 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION."

SEASONAL BUSINESS

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER ITS BUSINESS TO BE HIGHLY SEASONAL, IT HAS HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES IN ITS FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS, COMPARED

TO OTHER QUARTERS IN ITS FISCAL YEAR, DUE TO SEASONAL DEMAND RELATED TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND THE SCHOOL YEAR. HOWEVER, OVER THE PAST TWO YEARS THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED THESE SEASONAL

FLUCTUATIONS IN NET SALES DUE TO THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON THE OVERALL DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. PAST PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE NET SALES OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WARRANTY

THE COMPANY OFFERS A LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY ON ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE WARRANTY PERIOD IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE BY THE END USER. THE COMPANY

ALSO OFFERS A 90-DAY WARRANTY FOR APPLE SOFTWARE AND FOR APPLE SERVICE PARTS USED TO REPAIR APPLE HARDWARE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, CONSUMERS MAY PURCHASE EXTENDED SERVICE COVERAGE ON MOST

APPLE HARDWARE PRODUCTS IN ALL OF THE COMPANY'S MAJOR MARKETS.

BACKLOG

IN THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT BACKLOG AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME IS NOT A MEANINGFUL INDICATION OF ITS FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS. IN PARTICULAR, BACKLOG

OFTEN INCREASES IN ANTICIPATION OF OR IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS BECAUSE OF OVER ORDERING BY DEALERS ANTICIPATING SHORTAGES. BACKLOG OFTEN IS REDUCED ONCE DEALERS AND CUSTOMERS

BELIEVE THEY CAN OBTAIN SUFFICIENT SUPPLY. BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING, BACKLOG SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN LAWS ENACTED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT HAS TO DATE HAD NO MATERIAL EFFECT UPON THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS, OR COMPETITIVE POSITION. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE SUBJECT OF THESE

LAWS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

THE

PARLIAMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS WORKING TO FINALIZE THE WASTE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT DIRECTIVE (THE DIRECTIVE). THE DIRECTIVE MAKES MANUFACTURERS OF ELECTRICAL GOODS, INCLUDING

PERSONAL COMPUTERS, FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COLLECTION, RECYCLING, AND SAFE DISPOSAL OF PAST AND FUTURE PRODUCTS. THE DIRECTIVE MUST NOW BE APPROVED AND IMPLEMENTED BY INDIVIDUAL EUROPEAN

UNION GOVERNMENTS BY 2005. THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE DIRECTIVE RELATED TO PAST SALES OF ITS PRODUCTS AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH FUTURE SALES OF ITS PRODUCT MAY BE

SUBSTANTIAL. HOWEVER, BECAUSE IT IS LIKELY THAT SPECIFIC LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND ENFORCEMENT POLICIES WILL VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES, IT IS NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE TO

ESTIMATE THE COMPANY'S EXISTING LIABILITY OR FUTURE EXPENSES RESULTING FROM THE DIRECTIVE. AS THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES CLARIFY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES WITH

RESPECT TO THE DIRECTIVE, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS ITS POTENTIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT. SIMILAR LEGISLATION MAY BE ENACTED IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIES, INCLUDING FEDERAL AND STATE LEGISLATION IN THE

UNITED STATES, THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF WHICH COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

PITNEY BOWES INC. V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

PLAINTIFF PITNEY BOWES FILED THIS PATENT INFRINGEMENT ACTION ON JUNE 18, 2001 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN CONNECTICUT ALLEGING PATENT INFRINGEMENT RELATING TO

LASER PRINTER TECHNOLOGY. PLAINTIFF HAS FILED SIMILAR LAWSUITS AGAINST OTHER COMPANIES. PLAINTIFF SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND OTHER RELIEF. THE COMPANY HAS ANSWERED THE COMPLAINT, DENYING ALL

ALLEGATIONS AND ASSERTING NUMEROUS AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES. THE COMPANY ALSO ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS REQUESTING A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT FOR NON-INFRINGEMENT, UNENFORCEABILITY AND INVALIDITY OF

THE PATENTS AT ISSUE. THE CONNECTICUT COURT TRANSFERRED THIS CASE TO THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF KENTUCKY ON FEBRUARY 1, 2002 AND CONSOLIDATED THE CASE WITH TWO OTHER LAWSUITS, A DECLARATORY

JUDGMENT ACTION FILED BY XEROX AND PITNEY BOWES' PATENT INFRINGEMENT CASE AGAINST EPSON. THE CASE IS SET FOR TRIAL ON JUNE 8, 2004.

STERNBERG V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC. AND GORDON ET AL. V. APPLE COMPUTER, INC.

PLAINTIFF STERNBERG FILED THIS ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY ON MARCH 17, 2000 IN THE SANTA CLARA COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. THE CASE WAS A PURPORTED NATIONWIDE CONSUMER CLASS

ACTION, BY MARKETING AND SELLING A DVD PLAYER WITH IMAC DV AND IMAC DV SE COMPUTERS WHERE THE PLAYBACK WAS UNACCEPTABLE. A COMPANION CASE,

GORDON ET AL. V. APPLE COMPUTER,

INC

. WAS FILED BY LARGELY THE SAME PLAINTIFFS ON JUNE 14, 2000. THIS CASE WAS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS STERNBERG BUT WITH RESPECT TO A DIFFERENT COMPUTER

MODELTHE POWER MACINTOSH G4. THE COMPANY ANSWERED BOTH COMPLAINTS, DENYING ALL ALLEGATIONS AND ALLEGING NUMEROUS AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES. THE PARTIES REACHED A SETTLEMENT IN

AUGUST 2001 THAT RECEIVED FINAL

16

RESPECTIVELY. IN 2002, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED EMAGIC RESULTING IN A CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY

18

$1 MILLION FOR ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS TECHNOLOGIES WITH NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A SIMILAR CHARGE OF $11 MILLION IN 2001 RELATED TO ITS ACQUISITION OF

POWERSCHOOL. NET CHARGES RELATED TO COMPANY RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS OF $30 MILLION, $8 MILLION, AND $27 MILLION WERE RECOGNIZED IN 2002, 2000, AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2000,

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED THE COST OF A SPECIAL EXECUTIVE BONUS FOR THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR PAST SERVICES IN THE FORM OF AN AIRCRAFT WITH A TOTAL COST TO THE COMPANY OF APPROXIMATELY

$90 MILLION. IN 2002, OF THE ORIGINAL $90 MILLION ACCRUAL, $2 MILLION REMAINED UNSPENT AND WAS REVERSED.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THIS

SECTION AND OTHER PARTS OF THIS FORM 10-K CONTAIN FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM

THE RESULTS DISCUSSED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FACTORS THAT MIGHT CAUSE SUCH DIFFERENCES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THOSE DISCUSSED IN THE SUBSECTION ENTITLED "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT

FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION" BELOW. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSION SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES THERETO INCLUDED IN ITEM 8 OF THIS

FORM 10-K. ALL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN IS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S FISCAL CALENDAR.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THE COMPANY'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF ITS

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REQUIRES THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1 OF THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBE THE SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN

THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT IT BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR

MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THE FOLLOWING TO BE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES. THAT IS, THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO

MAKE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ABOUT MATTERS THAT ARE INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, INCLUDING STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) NO. 97-2,

SOFTWARE

REVENUE RECOGNITION

, AS AMENDED, AND SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) NO. 101,

REVENUE RECOGNITION IN

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

. SAB 101, AS AMENDED, SUMMARIZES CERTAIN OF THE SEC'S VIEWS IN APPLYING GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES TO REVENUE RECOGNITION IN FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON REVENUE RECOGNITION ISSUES IN THE ABSENCE OF AUTHORITATIVE LITERATURE ADDRESSING A SPECIFIC ARRANGEMENT OR A SPECIFIC INDUSTRY.

THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTIBILITY IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED

DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED, AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. REVENUE ON MULTIPLE ELEMENT SALES ARRANGEMENTS IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS ELEMENTS BASED ON VENDOR

SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH ELEMENT OF THE TRANSACTION AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EACH ELEMENT IS DELIVERED.

THE

COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING RESELLER AND END USER REBATES AND OTHER SALES PROGRAMS

AND VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES. FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT TRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INCREASE CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND INCUR INCREMENTAL PRICE PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS THAT

COULD RESULT IN INCREMENTAL REDUCTIONS OF REVENUE AT THE TIME SUCH PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CUSTOMER

19

INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY REDEEM THE INCENTIVE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PARTICULAR

INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IF A GREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF CUSTOMERS REDEEM SUCH INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER RESELLERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATION, CONSUMER, AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES

NOT REQUIRE COLLATERAL FROM ITS CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER, WHEN POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY DOES ATTEMPT TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK ON TRADE RECEIVABLES THROUGH THE USE OF FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS FOR SELECTED CUSTOMERS

WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES AND CREDIT INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN EUROPE, ASIA, AND LATIN AMERICA. HOWEVER, CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL, FLOORING

ARRANGEMENTS, OR CREDIT INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS.

THE

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS IS BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AND INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF THE CREDIT WORTHINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

OF THOSE SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE THE SPECIFIC RECEIVABLES TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS REASONABLY BELIEVED TO BE COLLECTIBLE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE FOR

ALL OTHER TRADE RECEIVABLES BASED ON MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH BAD DEBTS, THE GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS,

AND THE AGING OF SUCH RECEIVABLES. IF THERE IS A DETERIORATION OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, IF THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF A

MAJOR CUSTOMER, OR IF FUTURE ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON TRADE RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, WHICH

WOULD AFFECT EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE.

INVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF

COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED

REVIEW OF INVENTORY EACH PERIOD THAT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFECYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. THE PERSONAL COMPUTER

INDUSTRY IS SUBJECT TO A RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT AND COMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE. IF FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN FORECASTED OR IF

UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE UTILITY OF COMPONENT INVENTORY, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS IN THE

PERIOD WHEN THE WRITE-DOWNS ARE MADE.

THE

COMPANY ACCRUES NECESSARY RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO COMPONENT ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELED. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A

COMBINATION OF FORMAL PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. THESE FORMAL AND INFORMAL COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS FOR

PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 130 DAYS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS OR AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL REQUIREMENTS

FOR ANY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION FEES, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING GROSS MARGINS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE CANCELLATION FEES ARE

IDENTIFIED.

VALUATION OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF SUCH AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF THESE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF THEIR CARRYING AMOUNT TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO GENERATE.

IF SUCH ASSETS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE

20

IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS EQUALS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED NO MATERIAL

IMPAIRMENT ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO ITS PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT OR IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES DURING THE PAST THREE FISCAL YEARS, EXCEPT THOSE MADE IN CONJUNCTION WITH RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS,

DETERIORATION IN THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IN A GEOGRAPHIC REGION OR BUSINESS SEGMENT IN THE FUTURE, INCLUDING DETERIORATION IN THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL RETAIL STORES, COULD LEAD TO SUCH IMPAIRMENT

ADJUSTMENTS IN THE FUTURE PERIODS IN WHICH SUCH BUSINESS ISSUES ARE IDENTIFIED.

AS

OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD $85 MILLION IN GOODWILL. THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS

, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2002. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY NO LONGER AMORTIZES GOODWILL BUT INSTEAD PERFORMS A REVIEW OF GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, OR EARLIER

IF INDICATORS OF POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST. THE REVIEW OF GOODWILL FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT IS HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE AND REQUIRES THAT: (1) GOODWILL BE ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS BUSINESS UNITS OF THE

COMPANY'S BUSINESS TO WHICH IT RELATES; (2) THE COMPANY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE BUSINESS UNITS TO WHICH THE GOODWILL RELATES; AND (3) THE COMPANY DETERMINE THE BOOK VALUE OF

THOSE BUSINESS UNITS. IF THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF BUSINESS UNITS WITH ALLOCATED GOODWILL IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN THEIR BOOK VALUE, THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL

IDENTIFIABLE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF THOSE BUSINESS UNITS IN A MANNER SIMILAR TO A PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION FOR AN ACQUIRED BUSINESS. THIS REQUIRES INDEPENDENT VALUATION OF CERTAIN INTERNALLY

DEVELOPED AND UNRECOGNIZED ASSETS INCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY. ONCE THIS PROCESS IS COMPLETE, THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, IF ANY, CAN BE

DETERMINED.

BASED

ON THE COMPANY'S ESTIMATES AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL. HOWEVER, CHANGES IN VARIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S MARKET

CAPITALIZATION, CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S FORECASTS, AND CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL BUSINESS STRUCTURE COULD CAUSE ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS UNITS TO BE VALUED DIFFERENTLY THEREBY

CAUSING AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL. ADDITIONALLY, IN RESPONSE TO CHANGES IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND CHANGES IN GLOBAL OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE COMPANY MAY STRATEGICALLY REALIGN

ITS RESOURCES AND CONSIDER RESTRUCTURING, DISPOSING OF, OR OTHERWISE EXITING BUSINESSES, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES, OR GOODWILL.

VALUATION OF NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS

AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE COMPANY HELD INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES WITH A COMBINED CARRYING VALUE OF $39 MILLION. THESE INVESTMENTS,

WHICH ARE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AS NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE REQUIRING THAT THEY

BE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED IN

EQUITY AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS WHEN IT IS JUDGED AN INVESTMENT HAS EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN VALUE THAT IS

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ITS NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN TWO QUARTERS DURING THE LAST

TWO FISCAL YEARS. VARIOUS FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING WHETHER A DECLINE IN VALUE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, INCLUDING THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE

INVESTMENT'S MARKET VALUE HAS BEEN LESS THAN ITS COST BASIS, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND NEAR-TERM PROSPECTS OF THE ISSUER, AND THE COMPANY'S INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR

A PERIOD OF TIME SUFFICIENT TO ALLOW FOR ANY ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE.

THE

COMPANY'S NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE IN PUBLIC COMPANIES WHOSE SECURITY PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A PRE-TAX

IMPAIRMENT LOSS OF $50 MILLION RELATED TO TWO OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002. AS A RESULT, AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD NO SIGNIFICANT UNREALIZED GAINS

OR LOSSES RECORDED AGAINST THE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. SHOULD THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS FALL BELOW THE COMPANY'S CURRENT COST BASES AND/OR

THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OR PROSPECTS OF EITHER COMPANY DETERIORATE, THE COMPANY MAY DETERMINE IN A FUTURE PERIOD THAT SUCH A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY,

21

REQUIRING AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD SUCH A DETERMINATION IS MADE. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THESE INVESTMENTS AND POTENTIAL CHARGES RELATED TO THEIR IMPAIRMENT MAY BE

FOUND BELOW UNDER THE CAPTION "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION."

NET

SALES INCREASED $379 MILLION OR 7% DURING 2002 COMPARED TO 2001, WHILE MACINTOSH UNIT SALES WERE RELATIVELY FLAT YEAR-OVER-YEAR AT APPROXIMATELY 3.1 MILLION

UNITS. ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS, PERFORMANCE IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET WAS RELATIVELY STRONG, ESPECIALLY WHEN CONSIDERING THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT WHICH CURRENTLY OPERATES EXCLUSIVELY

IN THE UNITED STATES. HOWEVER, THE EUROPEAN AND JAPANESE MARKETS REMAINED SLUGGISH THROUGHOUT 2002. THE COMPANY'S NET SALES IN 2002 WERE POSITIVELY INFLUENCED BY A NUMBER OF FACTORS.

FIRST,

NET SALES FROM SOFTWARE, SERVICE, AND OTHER SOURCES ROSE $248 MILLION OR 26% IN 2002 VERSUS 2001. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING A 28% INCREASE IN COMBINED

THIRD-PARTY AND APPLE-

22

BRANDED SOFTWARE SALES; $143 MILLION IN NET SALES OF IPOD, THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYER THAT WAS INTRODUCED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2002; A 9% INCREASE IN THE SALE OF COMPUTER

ACCESSORIES; AND A 14% INCREASE IN SERVICE REVENUE CAUSED PRIMARILY BY INCREASED REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH EXTENDED MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE GROWTH IN SOFTWARE REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY THE

RESULT OF INCREASED SALES OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE IN THE COMPANY'S RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES AND EXPANSION IN RECENT YEARS IN THE NUMBER OF APPLE-BRANDED SOFTWARE TITLES.

SECOND,

OVERALL UNIT SALES OF MACINTOSH PORTABLE SYSTEMS GREW BY 92,000 UNITS OR 10% IN 2002 REFLECTING A GENERAL TREND IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET AWAY FROM DESKTOP SYSTEMS TOWARDS PORTABLE

SYSTEMS. DURING 2002, PORTABLE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS REPRESENTED 33% OF TOTAL SYSTEMS SALES VERSUS 31% IN 2001 AND 20% IN 2000. GROWTH IN THIS AREA HAS BEEN MOST PRONOUNCED FOR IBOOK, THE COMPANY'S

EDUCATION AND CONSUMER ORIENTED PORTABLE MACINTOSH SYSTEM. IBOOK UNIT SALES INCREASED 14% IN 2002 AND 9% IN 2001.

THIRD,

THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT GREW FROM 8 STORES AT THE END OF 2001 TO 40 STORES AT THE END OF 2002. THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S NET SALES GREW FROM $19 MILLION IN 2001 TO $283 MILLION IN

2002. WHILE THE RETAIL SEGMENT MAY CANNIBALIZE SOME NET SALES FROM THE COMPANY'S PREEXISTING SALES CHANNELS IN THE U.S., THE COMPANY DOES BELIEVE THAT A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S NET

SALES ARE INCREMENTAL TO THE COMPANY'S TOTAL NET SALES. SEE ADDITIONAL COMMENTS BELOW RELATED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT UNDER THE HEADING "SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE."

FOURTH,

THE COMPANY'S AVERAGE UNIT PRICING REMAINED RELATIVELY STABLE DURING 2002 AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS CHANGES IN OVERALL UNIT MIX OFFSET BY SOMEWHAT LOWER PRICING

YEAR-OVER-YEAR ON COMPARATIVE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS. NET SALES PER MACINTOSH UNIT SOLD DURING 2002 OF $1,462 PER UNIT REFLECTS THE SHIFT IN MIX TOWARDS RELATIVELY HIGHER-PRICED

PORTABLE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS AND REFLECTS THE IMPACT ON NET SALES OF THE RELATIVELY HIGHER-PRICED NEW IMAC DESIGN INTRODUCED DURING 2002. THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES IN MIX WERE OFFSET BY THE DECLINE IN

UNIT SALES OF RELATIVELY HIGHER-PRICED POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS AND BY LOWER PRICING ON COMPARATIVE MACINTOSH SYSTEMS DURING 2002 FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY'S MACINTOSH PRODUCT LINES IN RESPONSE TO

INDUSTRY PRICING PRESSURE.

FIFTH,

ANY COMPARISON OF NET SALES IN 2002 VERSUS 2001 MUST CONSIDER THE EFFECT OF UNUSUALLY LOW NET SALES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001. AS DISCUSSED BELOW, THIS WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL

FACTORS AT THE BEGINNING OF 2001, INCLUDING CONTINUING DETERIORATION IN WORLDWIDE DEMAND FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS, REBATE PROGRAMS AND PRICE CUTS INSTITUTED BY THE COMPANY DURING THAT QUARTER THAT COST

THE COMPANY APPROXIMATELY $138 MILLION, AND A PLAN IMPLEMENTED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001 TO REDUCE SUBSTANTIALLY THE LEVEL OF INVENTORY IN ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAT

RESULTED IN A DECLINE IN CHANNEL INVENTORY OF APPROXIMATELY 300,000 UNITS DURING THAT QUARTER. NET SALES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001 ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL BELOW.

OFFSETTING

THE FAVORABLE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY'S NET SALES IN 2002 WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY SEVERAL NOTABLE FACTORS. FIRST, UNIT SALES OF POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS FELL 18% DURING 2002

AS COMPARED TO 2001. THIS FOLLOWED A 35% DECLINE IN POWER MACINTOSH UNIT SALES IN 2001 FROM 2000. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS ARE HAVING

A PRONOUNCED NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ITS PROFESSIONAL AND CREATIVE CUSTOMERS AND THAT MANY OF THESE CUSTOMERS CONTINUE TO DELAY UPGRADES OF THEIR POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS DUE TO THE COMPANY'S ONGOING

TRANSITION TO MAC OS X, ITS NEW OPERATING SYSTEM, AND IN ANTICIPATION OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE VENDORS TRANSITIONING THEIR MACINTOSH APPLICATIONS TO RUN NATIVELY IN MAC OS X. FURTHER, THE COMPANY DID NOT

EXPERIENCE THE ANTICIPATED INCREASE IN POWER MACINTOSH SALES THAT IT EXPECTED FOLLOWING THE INTRODUCTION OF ADOBE'S PHOTOSHOP 7 DURING 2002. ADDITIONALLY, MANY PROFESSIONAL USERS MAY HAVE POSTPONED

UPGRADING THEIR SYSTEMS UNTIL AFTER THE INTRODUCTION OF MAC OS X JAGUAR RELEASED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2002. OTHERS MAY HAVE DELAYED UPGRADING UNTIL AFTER THE AVAILABILITY OF OTHER PROFESSIONALLY ORIENTED SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR MAC OS X SUCH AS QUARKXPRESS.

23

SECOND, DESPITE THE OVERALL INCREASE IN NET SALES DURING 2002 IN THE AMERICAS, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SEE WEAKNESS IN ITS U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL. TOTAL NET SALES IN THIS CHANNEL FELL 15% IN 2002 AND

4% IN 2001. THESE DECLINES ARE CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY DATA THAT SHOWS THE COMPANY LOSING MARKET SHARE IN THE U.S. EDUCATION MARKET IN EACH OF THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS

WEAKNESS HAS BEEN CAUSED BY MULTIPLE FACTORS, INCLUDING INCREASED PRICE COMPETITION IN THIS PRICE SENSITIVE MARKET FROM THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS WHO SELL WINDOWS-BASED PERSONAL COMPUTERS.

ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF THE COMPANY'S EDUCATION CUSTOMERS APPEAR TO BE DELAYING TECHNOLOGY PURCHASES DUE TO CONCERNS ABOUT THE OVERALL IMPACT OF THE WEAKER ECONOMY ON THEIR AVAILABLE FUNDING. THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO TAKE STEPS TO ADDRESS WEAKNESS IN THE U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL. HOWEVER, IT IS DIFFICULT TO ANTICIPATE HOW THIS TREND WILL AFFECT FISCAL 2003 AND TO ANTICIPATE WHEN AND IF THIS

TREND WILL REVERSE.

THIRD,

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IN GENERAL AND THE COMPANY SPECIFICALLY CONTINUE TO SEE RELATIVELY SOFT DEMAND FOR ITS PRODUCTS. DESPITE AN OVERALL INCREASE IN UNIT SALES OF CONSUMER ORIENTED

MACINTOSH SYSTEMS DURING 2002, CONSUMER SALES REMAIN FAR BELOW LEVELS EXPERIENCED IN 2000 AND EARLIER. WORSENING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS EXACERBATED BY THE ECONOMIC AND

POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES CAUSED BY TERRORIST ACTIVITIES AND THE ASSOCIATED INTERNATIONAL RESPONSES HAVE CLEARLY HAD A PRONOUNCED NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE OVERALL DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IN

VIRTUALLY ALL OF ITS MARKETS. FURTHER, GROWTH IN THE OVERALL PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY HAS BEEN SLOWED DUE TO THE HIGH MARKET PENETRATION OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND A LENGTHENING OF CONSUMER,

CREATIVE, AND BUSINESS PERSONAL COMPUTER UPGRADE CYCLES. IN SHORT, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT EXPANSION IN THE OVERALL MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAS FOR THE MOST PART STALLED AND THAT GROWTH AWAITS

A COMBINATION OF ECONOMIC RECOVERY AND TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENTS.

NET

SALES DECREASED $2.6 BILLION OR 33% DURING 2001 COMPARED TO 2000, WHILE MACINTOSH UNIT SALES FELL 32% FROM 2000. DEMAND FOR ALL OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IN ALL OF THE COMPANY'S GEOGRAPHIC

OPERATING SEGMENTS WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THROUGHOUT 2001 BY UNFAVORABLE GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. ON A YEAR-OVER-YEAR BASIS, NET SALES AND MACINTOSH UNIT SALES WERE DOWN IN

ALL OF THE COMPANY'S GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS, AND NET SALES AND UNIT SALES BY PRODUCT WERE DOWN FOR EACH MACINTOSH PRODUCT CATEGORY EXCEPT IBOOK. IN ADDITION TO GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, TWO

OTHER PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECLINE IN NET SALES DURING 2001. FIRST, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, THE COMPANY EXECUTED A PLAN DURING THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF 2001 TO REDUCE SUBSTANTIALLY THE

LEVEL OF INVENTORY IN ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. AS A RESULT OF THESE EFFORTS, THE COMPANY'S MACINTOSH CHANNEL INVENTORY FELL BY APPROXIMATELY 450,000 UNITS DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF 2001.

SECOND, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT MANY OF ITS PROFESSIONAL USERS WERE DELAYING UPGRADES OF THEIR POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS DUE TO THE COMPANY'S ONGOING TRANSITION TO MAC OS X, ITS NEW OPERATING SYSTEM,

AND IN ANTICIPATION OF SOFTWARE VENDORS TRANSITIONING THEIR MAC APPLICATIONS TO RUN NATIVELY IN MAC OS X.

SEVERAL

POSITIVE FACTORS COMBINED TO PARTIALLY MITIGATE THE OVERALL DECLINE IN NET SALES DURING 2001. THE NET SALES PER MACINTOSH UNIT SOLD REMAINED RELATIVELY STRONG DURING 2001 AFTER ADJUSTING FOR

THE $138 MILLION IMPACT TO NET SALES OF THE REBATE PROGRAMS AND PRICE CUTS INSTITUTED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001, FALLING ONLY ABOUT 2.5% FROM 2000. THE RELATIVELY STRONG

PER UNIT SALES IN 2001 REFLECTS SOMEWHAT LOWER YEAR-OVER-YEAR PRICING ON COMPARATIVE SYSTEMS, OFFSET BY A SHIFT IN OVERALL SALES MIX TOWARD HIGHER-PRICED PORTABLE SYSTEMS.

ALSO, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED VERY LITTLE SHIFT IN THE MIX OF OVERALL COMBINED UNIT SALES OF RELATIVELY LOWER-PRICED CONSUMER AND EDUCATION MACINTOSH SYSTEMS, IMAC AND IBOOK, AND THEIR HIGHER-PRICED

PROFESSIONALLY ORIENTED EQUIVALENTS. COMBINED UNIT SALES OF IMAC AND IBOOK SYSTEMS ACCOUNTED FOR 58% OF TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES IN 2001 AND 60% IN 2000. SECOND, COMBINED UNIT SALES OF PORTABLE

SYSTEMS, IBOOK AND POWERBOOK, ACTUALLY ROSE 2% DURING 2001 DESPITE THE NEGATIVE ECONOMIC CLIMATE AND THE OVERALL DECLINE IN UNIT SALES. NOT ONLY DOES THIS INCREASE IN PORTABLE SYSTEM SALES REFLECT A

GENERAL INDUSTRY SHIFT TOWARD PORTABLE SYSTEMS, IT IS ALSO SPECIFICALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE STRONG DEMAND FOR REDESIGNED IBOOKS INTRODUCED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2001 AND FOR THE TITANIUM

POWERBOOK G4 WHICH WAS INTRODUCED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2001. THIRD, A SMALL DECLINE IN NET SALES

24

IN THE U.S. EDUCATION MARKET DURING 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 WAS PARTIALLY MITIGATED BY A 7% INCREASE IN U.S. EDUCATION UNIT SALES DURING 2001.

FIRST

QUARTER 2001 NET SALES DECREASED 57% TO $1.007 BILLION COMPARED TO THE SAME QUARTER IN 2000 AND DECREASED 46% FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000. BOTH THE

YEAR-OVER-YEAR AND SEQUENTIAL DECLINES IN NET SALES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001 WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN WORLDWIDE DEMAND

FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND REBATE PROGRAMS AND PRICE CUTS INSTITUTED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE QUARTER THAT COST THE COMPANY APPROXIMATELY $138 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A

PLAN DURING THE FIRST QUARTER TO REDUCE SUBSTANTIALLY THE LEVEL OF INVENTORY IN ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FROM THE AMOUNTS AT THE END OF FISCAL 2000 TO LOWER LEVELS BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2001. THE COMPANY ENDED FISCAL 2000 WITH SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVENTORY IN ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAN PLANNED DUE TO THE LOWER THAN EXPECTED SELL-THROUGH OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THAT YEAR. THE COMPANY REDUCED MACINTOSH CHANNEL INVENTORY DURING THE FIRST QUARTER BY APPROXIMATELY 300,000 UNITS. THESE FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THE 52%

YEAR-OVER-YEAR DECLINE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER IN TOTAL MACINTOSH UNIT SALES THAT WERE EXPERIENCED ACROSS THE COMPANY'S ENTIRE PRODUCT LINE. THESE FACTORS ALSO REDUCED THE NET

SALES PER MACINTOSH UNIT SOLD (A FUNCTION OF TOTAL NET SALES ASSOCIATED WITH MACINTOSH UNITS AND TOTAL MACINTOSH CPU UNIT SALES) DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001 TO $1,476, A DECLINE OF APPROXIMATELY

12% FROM THE SAME PERIOD IN 2000.

SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE

THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS INCLUDE THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND RETAIL. THE AMERICAS

SEGMENT INCLUDES BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA, EXCEPT FOR THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT. THE EUROPEAN SEGMENT INCLUDES EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. THE JAPAN SEGMENT

INCLUDES ONLY JAPAN. THE RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATES APPLE-OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE UNITED STATES. EACH REPORTABLE GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT PROVIDES SIMILAR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND

SIMILAR SERVICES. FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 ON THIS FORM 10-K IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AT NOTE 11, "SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA."

AMERICAS

NET SALES FOR THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCREASED 3% OR $92 MILLION IN 2002. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE AMERICAS SEGMENT WAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY A DECLINE IN U.S. EDUCATION

SALES IN 2002 OF $215 MILLION. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT ALSO EXPERIENCED A 17% DECLINE IN POWER MACINTOSH UNIT SALES. HOWEVER, OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL, UNIT SALES OF CONSUMER DESKTOP

AND PORTABLE SYSTEMS REBOUNDED FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL DECLINES EXPERIENCED IN 2001, RISING A COMBINED 31% IN 2002. SALES OF SOFTWARE, PERIPHERALS, AND ACCESSORIES WERE ALSO UP IN THE AMERICAS DURING

2002. GROWTH IN UNIT SALES OF CONSUMER ORIENTED SYSTEMS DURING 2002 IN THE AMERICAS IS SOMEWHAT ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SIGNIFICANTLY DEPRESSED LEVEL OF NET SALES EXPERIENCED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001

DISCUSSED ABOVE. HOWEVER, GROWTH IN THE AMERICAS WAS SOMEWHAT NEGATIVELY AFFECTED, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO CONSUMER-ORIENTED SYSTEMS, BY THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT IN

THE U.S. MORE THAN 70% OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S MACINTOSH UNIT SALES DURING 2002 WERE FOR IMACS AND IBOOKS.

THE

AMERICAS SEGMENT'S 2001 NET SALES AND UNIT SALES DECLINED 30% AND 29%, RESPECTIVELY, FROM 2000. THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE AMERICAS SEGMENT FOR 2001 REFLECTS THE COMPANY'S OVERALL

PERFORMANCE CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN YEAR-OVER-YEAR QUARTERLY NET SALES AND UNITS SALES, PARTICULARLY DURING THE FIRST QUARTER AND PARTICULARLY IN CONSUMER

CHANNELS, WITH SEQUENTIAL INCREASES IN UNIT SALES AND NET SALES DURING EACH OF THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF 2001. NET SALES IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT DURING 2001 WERE ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY THE

COMPANY'S OVERALL REDUCTION IN CHANNEL INVENTORIES DURING THE YEAR. CONSUMER SALES IN THE AMERICAS WERE PARTICULARLY HARD HIT BY CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL,

UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANY'S CONSUMER ORIENTED IMAC FELL 64% IN 2001. THE EFFECT OF FALLING CONSUMER DEMAND IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STRONG U.S. EDUCATION SALES. THE COMPANY'S

UNIT SALES IN U.S. EDUCATION MARKETS ROSE 7% IN 2001 DRIVEN BY THE ACCEPTANCE OF THE

25

COMPANY'S NEW PORTABLE PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY THE IBOOK, AND REFLECT A GENERAL SHIFT IN DEMAND IN THE U.S. EDUCATION MARKET TOWARDS PORTABLE VERSUS DESKTOP SYSTEMS. PORTABLE SYSTEMS ACCOUNTED FOR 28%

OF TOTAL UNIT SALES IN THE COMPANY'S U.S. EDUCATION MARKET IN 2001 COMPARED TO 18% DURING 2000.

DURING

2002 AND 2001, THE AMERICAS SEGMENT REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 54% AND 56%, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL NET SALES AND REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 56% AND 57%, RESPECTIVELY, OF TOTAL

MACINTOSH UNIT SALES.

EUROPE

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN EUROPE REMAINED WEAK THROUGHOUT 2002, AND THE OVERALL DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IN THAT REGION REMAINED FLAT DURING 2002 VERSUS 2001. UNIT SALES

IN EUROPE FOR 2002 REFLECT RELATIVELY STRONGER DEMAND FOR CONSUMER-ORIENTED PRODUCTS, PARTICULARLY IBOOK WHOSE UNIT SALES INCREASED 27% IN 2002, OFFSET BY DECLINES IN POWER MACINTOSH UNIT SALES.

NET

SALES IN EUROPE FELL $568 MILLION OR 31% DURING 2001 COMPARED TO 2000, WHILE EUROPE'S UNIT SALES FELL 32%. EUROPE'S RESULTS REFLECT THE WORSENING ECONOMIC CLIMATE IN EUROPE IN THE LATTER

HALF OF 2001 AND REDUCTIONS IN CHANNEL INVENTORIES AS EXPERIENCED IN THE COMPANY'S OTHER GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS. COMBINED UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANY'S CONSUMER ORIENTED PRODUCTS IN EUROPE WERE

PARTICULARLY IMPACTED DURING 2001, FALLING 40% FROM 2000.

JAPAN

NET SALES IN JAPAN REMAINED FLAT DURING 2002 VERSUS 2001, WITH A SLIGHT DECLINE IN UNIT SALES OF 2%. CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S OTHER GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENTS, DURING

2002 JAPAN SHOWED GROWTH IN UNIT SALES OF CONSUMER SYSTEMS AND A DECLINE IN UNIT SALES OF POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS. JAPAN'S IMAC UNIT SALES INCREASED 85% IN 2002. HOWEVER, IN THE CASE OF JAPAN THE

INCREASE IN IMAC UNIT SHIPMENTS IN 2002 VERSUS 2001 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE UNUSUALLY DEPRESSED LEVEL OF NET SALES EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001 DISCUSSED ABOVE.

ADDITIONALLY, NET SALES IN JAPAN ON A SEQUENTIAL AND YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARATIVE BASIS GENERALLY WORSENED AS 2002 PROGRESSED REFLECTING PARTICULARLY POOR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

THAT CURRENTLY EXIST IN JAPAN.

NET

SALES AND UNIT SALES IN JAPAN FELL 47% AND 46%, RESPECTIVELY, IN 2001 VERSUS 2000. ALTHOUGH UNIT SALES AND NET SALES IN JAPAN HAVE GENERALLY TRENDED UPWARDS AS 2001 PROGRESSED, THE JAPAN SEGMENT

HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY AFFECTED BY CURRENT UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. REFLECTING THE CONTINUING HARSH CONSUMER CLIMATE IN JAPAN, THE JAPAN SEGMENT'S COMBINED UNIT SALES OF IMACS AND IBOOKS DURING

2001 WERE DOWN 58% FROM 2000, AND PROFESSIONALLY ORIENTED SYSTEMS UNIT SALES FELL 30%.

RETAIL

BY THE END OF SEPTEMBER 2002, THE COMPANY HAD 40 RETAIL STORES OPERATING IN THE UNITED STATES, 32 OF WHICH WERE OPENED DURING FISCAL 2002. THE COMPANY HAS OPENED 11

ADDITIONAL STORES DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. DURING 2002, APPROXIMATELY 39% OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S NET SALES CAME FROM THE SALE OF APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY PERIPHERALS AND SOFTWARE. THIS

COMPARES TO 21% FOR THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE. WITH AN AVERAGE OF 35 STORES OPEN, THE RETAIL SEGMENT ACHIEVED AVERAGE ANNUALIZED REVENUE PER STORE DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF APPROXIMATELY

$12 MILLION AND HAD APPROXIMATELY 2.25 MILLION VISITORS. THE RETAIL SEGMENT REPORTED A LOSS FOR ALL OF 2002 OF $22 MILLION, AND A LOSS FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002 OF

$3 MILLION.

EXPANSION

OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN FIXED ASSETS AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE, OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS, PERSONNEL, AND OTHER

OPERATING EXPENSES. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETAIL SEGMENT TOTALED $106 MILLION IN 2002 AND $92 MILLION IN 2001. AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAD

807 EMPLOYEES AND HAD OUTSTANDING OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL STORE SPACE AND RELATED FACILITIES OF $209 MILLION. THE COMPANY WOULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS SHOULD IT

CHOOSE TO TERMINATE ITS RETAIL SEGMENT OR CLOSE INDIVIDUAL STORES. SUCH COSTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. INVESTMENT

26

IN A NEW BUSINESS MODEL SUCH AS THE RETAIL SEGMENT IS INHERENTLY RISKY, PARTICULARLY IN LIGHT OF THE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT INVOLVED, THE CURRENT ECONOMIC CLIMATE, AND THE FIXED NATURE OF A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S OPERATING EXPENSES. RESULTS FOR THIS SEGMENT ARE DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, SOME OF WHICH ARE DISCUSSED BELOW UNDER THE HEADING

"FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION."

BACKLOG

IN THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT BACKLOG AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME IS NOT A MEANINGFUL INDICATION OF ITS FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS. IN PARTICULAR, BACKLOG

OFTEN INCREASES IN ANTICIPATION OF OR IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS BECAUSE OF OVER-ORDERING BY DEALERS ANTICIPATING SHORTAGES. BACKLOG OFTEN IS REDUCED ONCE DEALERS AND

CUSTOMERS BELIEVE THEY CAN OBTAIN SUFFICIENT SUPPLY. BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING, BACKLOG CANNOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S BACKLOG MAY BE FOUND BELOW UNDER THE HEADING "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION."

GROSS

MARGIN INCREASED TO 28% OF NET SALES IN 2002 FROM 23% IN 2001. AS DISCUSSED BELOW, GROSS MARGIN IN 2001 WAS UNUSUALLY LOW RESULTING FROM NEGATIVE GROSS MARGIN OF 2% EXPERIENCED IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2001. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, THE COMPANY'S QUARTERLY GROSS MARGINS DECLINED DURING FISCAL 2002 FROM 31% IN THE FIRST QUARTER DOWN TO 26% IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. THIS DECLINE RESULTED

FROM SEVERAL FACTORS INCLUDING A RISE IN COMPONENT COSTS AS THE YEAR PROGRESSED AND AGGRESSIVE PRICING BY THE COMPANY ACROSS ITS PRODUCTS LINES INSTITUTED AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED PRICING PRESSURES IN

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ITS GROSS MARGIN AND THE GROSS MARGIN OF THE OVERALL PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY WILL REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE THROUGHOUT FISCAL 2003 IN LIGHT

OF WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, FLAT DEMAND FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS IN GENERAL, AND THE RESULTING PRESSURE ON PRICES.

THE

FOREGOING STATEMENTS REGARDING ANTICIPATED GROSS MARGIN IN 2003 AND THE GENERAL DEMAND FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS DURING 2003 ARE FORWARD-LOOKING. GROSS MARGIN COULD DIFFER FROM ANTICIPATED LEVELS

BECAUSE OF SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING CERTAIN OF THOSE SET FORTH BELOW IN THE SUBSECTION ENTITLED "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION." THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

CURRENT GROSS MARGINS WILL BE MAINTAINED, TARGETED GROSS MARGIN LEVELS WILL BE ACHIEVED, OR CURRENT MARGINS ON EXISTING INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS WILL BE MAINTAINED. IN GENERAL, GROSS MARGINS AND MARGINS ON

INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS WILL REMAIN UNDER SIGNIFICANT DOWNWARD PRESSURE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED INDUSTRY WIDE GLOBAL PRICING PRESSURES, INCREASED COMPETITION, COMPRESSED PRODUCT

LIFE CYCLES, POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIAL AND OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES, AND POTENTIAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT MIX, INCLUDING HIGHER UNIT SALES OF

CONSUMER PRODUCTS WITH LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES AND LOWER GROSS MARGINS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE DOWNWARD PRESSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PRICING ACTIONS WITH RESPECT TO ITS

PRODUCTS. GROSS MARGINS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE QUALITY PROBLEMS AND WARRANTY COSTS AND TO STIMULATE DEMAND FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY'S

OPERATING STRATEGY AND PRICING TAKE INTO ACCOUNT ANTICIPATED CHANGES IN FOREIGN

27

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES OVER TIME; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED IN THE SHORT-TERM BY FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES.

THE

COMPANY ORDERS COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILDS INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S MARKETS ARE VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, THERE

IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND PRODUCE OR ORDER FROM THIRD PARTIES EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY LEVELS AND OUTSTANDING PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND TO

RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

GROSS

MARGIN DECLINED TO 23% OF NET SALES IN 2001 FROM 27% IN 2000. THIS DECLINE RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM GROSS MARGIN OF NEGATIVE 2% EXPERIENCED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001 COMPARED TO 26% GROSS

MARGIN FOR THE SAME QUARTER IN 2000. IN ADDITION TO LOWER THAN NORMAL NET SALES, FIRST QUARTER 2001 MARGINS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE REBATE PROGRAMS AND PRICE CUTS DISCUSSED ABOVE THAT

DECREASED REVENUE BY APPROXIMATELY $138 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, ACTUAL AND FORECASTED DECLINES IN NET SALES CAUSED THE COMPANY TO RECOGNIZE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001 APPROXIMATELY

$122 MILLION OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH PURCHASE ORDER CANCELLATIONS AND LOSS COMMITMENTS FOR COMPONENT PURCHASES. WITHOUT THESE CHARGES, GROSS MARGIN FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001 WOULD HAVE

BEEN APPROXIMATELY 21%, AND GROSS MARGIN FOR ALL OF 2001 WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY 27%. AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES, THE COMPANY'S GROSS MARGIN INCREASED EACH QUARTER AS 2001 PROGRESSED REACHING

30% DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER. THIS PATTERN REFLECTS THE FAVORABLE IMPACT DURING 2001 OF DECLINING COMPONENT COSTS, ESPECIALLY FOR DRAM, HARD DRIVES, AND FLAT PANEL SCREENS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D)

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THAT FOCUSED INVESTMENTS IN R&D ARE CRITICAL TO ITS FUTURE GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO TIMELY

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE COMPANY'S CORE BUSINESS STRATEGY. R&D EXPENSE INCREASED 4% OR $16 MILLION TO $446 MILLION IN 2002 AS COMPARED TO 2001.

THIS FOLLOWED A $50 MILLION OR 13% INCREASE IN 2001 AS COMPARED TO 2000. THE OVERALL INCREASE IN R&D EXPENSE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS RELATES PRIMARILY TO INCREASED R&D HEADCOUNT AND SUPPORT FOR

NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES. R&D SPENDING IN 2002 ALSO INCLUDED CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF APPROXIMATELY $13.3 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X

JAGUAR AND APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW POWERSCHOOL ENTERPRISE STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM. R&D SPENDING IN 2001 ALSO INCLUDED CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF

APPROXIMATELY $5.4 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF MAC OS X. FURTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS

MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTE 1 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE (SG&A)

SG&A DECREASED $27 MILLION OR 2% DURING 2002 AS COMPARED TO 2001. THE DECREASE IN SG&A IN 2002 IS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF LOWER DISCRETIONARY SPENDING ON MARKETING AND

ADVERTISING EXPENSES, DECREASED SPENDING RELATED TO INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND BENEFITS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S RESTRUCTURING

28

ACTIONS IN 2002 AND 2001. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SALES EXPENSE IN 2002 RESULTING FROM INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT.

SG&A EXPENDITURES DECREASED $28 MILLION OR 2% DURING 2001 AS COMPARED TO 2000. DECLINES IN SG&A SPENDING IN BOTH 2002 AND 2001 REFLECT THE COMPANY'S OVERALL EFFORTS TO STABILIZE AND SELECTIVELY

REDUCE RECURRING SG&A COSTS IN LIGHT OF LOWER NET SALES AND TO REDUCE DISCRETIONARY MARKETING AND ADVERTISING EXPENSES. GIVEN CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND THE COMPANY'S CONTINUED STRATEGIC

INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND ITS RETAIL SEGMENT, THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IDENTIFYING ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES TO MAKE APPROPRIATE REDUCTIONS IN SG&A COSTS.

2002 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

DURING FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED TOTAL RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $30 MILLION RELATED TO ACTIONS INTENDED TO ELIMINATE CERTAIN ACTIVITIES AND BETTER ALIGN THE

COMPANY'S OPERATING EXPENSES WITH EXISTING GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND TO PARTIALLY OFFSET THE COST OF CONTINUING INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND INVESTMENTS IN THE COMPANY'S RETAIL

OPERATING SEGMENT. ONCE FULLY IMPLEMENTED, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS WILL RESULT IN REDUCED QUARTERLY OPERATING EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION.

OF

THE $30 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE FOR FISCAL 2002, $6 MILLION WAS INCURRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002 RELATED TO ACTIONS DESIGNED TO REDUCE HEADCOUNT COSTS IN CORPORATE

OPERATIONS AND SALES AND TO ADJUST ITS POWERSCHOOL PRODUCT STRATEGY. HEADCOUNT ACTIONS, PRIMARILY IN CORPORATE OPERATIONS, SALES, AND POWERSCHOOL RELATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, RESULTED IN THE

ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 180 POSITIONS WORLDWIDE AT A COST OF $1.8 MILLION. THE SHIFT IN PRODUCT STRATEGY AT POWERSCHOOL INCLUDED DISCONTINUING DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OF A POWERSCHOOL

PRODUCT THAT RESULTED IN THE IMPAIRMENT OF PREVIOUSLY CAPITALIZED DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRODUCT IN THE AMOUNT OF $4.5 MILLION. THE REMAINING CHARGE IN 2002 OF $24 MILLION

WAS INCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002 AND WILL ULTIMATELY RESULT IN THE ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 425 POSITIONS WORLDWIDE, 415 OF WHICH WERE ELIMINATED BY SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, AT A COST

OF $8 MILLION. POSITIONS WERE ELIMINATED PRIMARILY IN THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, AND ADMINISTRATIVE FUNCTIONS. IN ADDITION, THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ALSO INCLUDED

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S INFORMATION SYSTEMS STRATEGY RESULTING IN TERMINATION OF EQUIPMENT LEASES AND CANCELLATION OF EXISTING PROJECTS AND ACTIVITIES. RELATED LEASE AND CONTRACT

CANCELLATION CHARGES TOTALED $12 MILLION, AND CHARGES FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENTS TOTALED $4 MILLION. OF THE TOTAL CHARGE IN 2002 OF $30 MILLION, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL HAD BEEN SPENT BY

SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, EXCEPT FOR APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION RELATED PRIMARILY TO FUTURE PAYMENTS ON ABANDONED OPERATING LEASES.

2000 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2000, THE COMPANY INITIATED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS RESULTING IN RECOGNITION OF AN $8 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE. THIS CHARGE WAS COMPRISED

OF $3 MILLION FOR THE WRITE-OFF OF VARIOUS OPERATING ASSETS AND $5 MILLION FOR SEVERANCE PAYMENTS TO APPROXIMATELY 95 EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATED WITH CONSOLIDATION OF VARIOUS

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS. OF THE $5 MILLION ACCRUED FOR SEVERANCE, $2.5 MILLION HAD BEEN SPENT BEFORE THE END OF 2000, AND THE REMAINDER WAS SPENT IN

2001. OF THE $3 MILLION ACCRUED FOR THE WRITE-OFF OF VARIOUS ASSETS, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL WAS UTILIZED BEFORE THE END OF 2000.

29

PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D)

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED EMAGIC GMBH, A PROVIDER OF PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS FOR COMPUTER BASED MUSIC PRODUCTION, FOR APPROXIMATELY

$30 MILLION IN CASH; $551,000 OF WHICH WAS ALLOCATED TO IPR&D. THE AMOUNT OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATED TO IPR&D WAS EXPENSED UPON ACQUISITION, BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF

PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES EXISTED. THE IPR&D RELATES PRIMARILY TO EMAGIC'S LOGIC SERIES TECHNOLOGY AND EXTENSIONS. AT THE DATE OF THE

ACQUISITION, THE PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT WERE BETWEEN 43%-83% COMPLETE, AND IT WAS EXPECTED THAT THE REMAINING WORK WOULD BE COMPLETED DURING THE COMPANY'S FISCAL 2003 AT A COST OF

APPROXIMATELY $415,000. THE REMAINING EFFORTS INCLUDE FINALIZING USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT, AND TESTING. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D WAS DETERMINED BY AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY VALUATION

USING THE INCOME APPROACH, WHICH REFLECTS THE PROJECTED FREE CASH FLOWS THAT WILL BE GENERATED BY THE IPR&D PROJECTS AND THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY, AND DISCOUNTING THE PROJECTED

NET CASH FLOWS BACK TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE USING A DISCOUNT RATE OF 25%.

IN

MAY 2001, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED POWERSCHOOL, INC. (POWERSCHOOL), A PROVIDER OF WEB-BASED STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEMS FOR K-12 SCHOOLS AND DISTRICTS THAT ENABLES

SCHOOLS TO RECORD, ACCESS, REPORT, AND MANAGE THEIR STUDENT DATA AND PERFORMANCE IN REAL-TIME, AND GIVES PARENTS REAL-TIME WEB ACCESS TO TRACK THEIR CHILDREN'S PROGRESS. OF

TOTAL PURCHASE CONSIDERATION OF $66.1 MILLION, $10.8 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO IPR&D AND WAS EXPENSED UPON ACQUISITION BECAUSE THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF PRODUCTS UNDER DEVELOPMENT

HAD NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED AND NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES EXISTED. THE IPR&D RELATES TO TECHNOLOGIES REPRESENTING PROCESSES AND EXPERTISE EMPLOYED TO DESIGN, DEVELOP, AND DEPLOY A FUNCTIONING, SCALABLE

WEB-BASED STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM FOR USE BY K-12 SCHOOLS. AT THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION, THE POWERSCHOOL PRODUCT UNDER DEVELOPMENT WAS APPROXIMATELY 50% COMPLETE, AND IT

WAS EXPECTED THAT THE REMAINING 50% WOULD BE COMPLETED DURING THE COMPANY'S FISCAL 2002 AT A COST OF APPROXIMATELY $9.25 MILLION. THE REMAINING EFFORTS, WHICH WERE COMPLETED DURING 2002,

INCLUDED COMPLETION OF CODING, FINALIZING USER INTERFACE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT, AND TESTING. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE IPR&D WAS DETERMINED BY AN INDEPENDENT THIRD-PARTY VALUATION USING THE INCOME

APPROACH, WHICH REFLECTS THE PROJECTED FREE CASH FLOWS THAT WILL BE GENERATED BY THE IPR&D PROJECTS AND THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ACQUIRED TECHNOLOGY, AND DISCOUNTING THE PROJECTED NET CASH FLOWS

BACK TO THEIR PRESENT VALUE USING A DISCOUNT RATE OF 25%.

EXECUTIVE BONUS

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2000, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A SPECIAL EXECUTIVE BONUS FOR THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER FOR PAST SERVICES IN THE FORM OF

AN AIRCRAFT WITH A TOTAL COST TO THE COMPANY OF APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WAS NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE TOTAL CHARGE WAS FOR THE COST OF THE AIRCRAFT.

THE OTHER HALF REPRESENTS ALL OTHER COSTS AND TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BONUS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, ALL SIGNIFICANT WORK AND PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AIRCRAFT WERE COMPLETE. OF THE

ORIGINAL $90 MILLION ACCRUAL, $2.4 MILLION REMAINED UNSPENT AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002 AND WAS REVERSED.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON NON-CURRENT INVESTMENTS

INVESTMENTS CATEGORIZED AS NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ARE IN EQUITY AND DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF PUBLIC COMPANIES. THE

COMPANY'S NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, AND CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE COMPANIES CARRIED IN OTHER ASSETS, HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

REQUIRING THAT THEY BE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED IN EQUITY AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN THE EVENT A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW THE COST BASIS OF ONE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. THE

COMPANY INCLUDES RECOGNIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE SALE OR FROM OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS IN OTHER INCOME AND

EXPENSE. FURTHER INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTE 2

OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DURING

2002, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN OF THESE INVESTMENTS WERE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A

$44 MILLION CHARGE TO EARNINGS TO WRITE-DOWN THE BASIS OF ITS INVESTMENT IN EARTHLINK, INC. (EARTHLINK), A $6 MILLION CHARGE TO EARNINGS TO WRITE-DOWN THE

BASIS OF ITS INVESTMENT IN AKAMAI TECHNOLOGIES, INC. (AKAMAI), AND A $15 MILLION CHARGE TO EARNINGS TO WRITE-DOWN THE BASIS OF ITS INVESTMENT IN A PRIVATE COMPANY INVESTMENT.

THESE LOSSES IN 2002 WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SALE OF 117,000 SHARES OF EARTHLINK STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $2 MILLION AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $223,000, THE SALE OF 250,000 SHARES OF

AKAMAI STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $2 MILLION AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $710,000, AND THE SALE OF APPROXIMATELY 4.7 MILLION SHARES OF ARM HOLDINGS PLC (ARM) STOCK FOR BOTH NET PROCEEDS

AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $21 MILLION.

DURING

2001, THE COMPANY SOLD A TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 1 MILLION SHARES OF AKAMAI STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $39 MILLION AND RECORDED A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $36 MILLION, AND SOLD A

TOTAL OF APPROXIMATELY 29.8 MILLION SHARES OF ARM STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $176 MILLION AND RECORDED A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $174 MILLION. THESE GAINS DURING 2001 WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A $114 MILLION CHARGE TO EARNINGS THAT REFLECTED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT IN EARTHLINK AND AN

$8 MILLION CHARGE THAT REFLECTED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN PRIVATE COMPANY INVESTMENTS. DURING 2000, THE COMPANY SOLD A TOTAL OF

APPROXIMATELY 45.2 MILLION SHARES OF ARM STOCK FOR NET PROCEEDS OF $372 MILLION AND A GAIN BEFORE TAXES OF $367 MILLION.

THE

COMBINED CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS IN EARTHLINK, AKAMAI, AND ARM AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, WAS $39 MILLION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS LIKELY THERE WILL CONTINUE TO

BE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

31

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVES AND CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE

ON OCTOBER 1, 2000, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD (SFAS) NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

. SFAS NO. 133 ESTABLISHED ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AND EXPOSURE DEFINITION. NET OF THE

RELATED INCOME TAX EFFECT OF APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION, ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 133 RESULTED IN A FAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT-TYPE ADJUSTMENT TO NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY

$12 MILLION FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001. THE $17 MILLION GROSS TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT WAS COMPRISED OF A $23 MILLION FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT FOR THE RESTATEMENT TO FAIR VALUE OF THE

DERIVATIVE COMPONENT OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT IN SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD. (SAMSUNG), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE

DERIVATIVES. SFAS NO. 133 ALSO REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO ADJUST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVE COMPONENT OF ITS INVESTMENT IN SAMSUNG TO EARNINGS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2001, THE

BEFORE TAX EFFECT OF WHICH WAS AN UNREALIZED LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $13 MILLION.

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET

NET INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME WAS $112 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002, COMPARED TO $217 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001. THIS $105 MILLION OR 48% DECREASE IS PRIMARILY THE

RESULT OF DECLINING INVESTMENT YIELDS ON THE COMPANY'S CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS RESULTING FROM SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER MARKET INTEREST RATES. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED

BY THE COMPANY ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS FELL TO 2.85% IN 2002 COMPARED TO 5.38% IN 2001.

NET

INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME INCREASED $14 MILLION OR 7% TO $217 MILLION DURING 2001. THE INCREASE WAS DUE IN PART TO INTEREST INCOME FROM HIGHER CASH AND INVESTED BALANCES IN 2001,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINING INTEREST RATES AND INVESTMENT YIELDS, AND A REBALANCING OF THE AGGREGATE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TO A HIGHER PROPORTION OF LOWER RISK AND BETTER CREDIT INVESTMENTS. THE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED BY THE COMPANY ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS FELL TO 5.38% IN 2001 COMPARED TO 6.12% IN 2000.

THE

COMPANY EXPECTS INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET TO DECLINE SUBSTANTIALLY IN 2003 AS DECLINES IN INTEREST RATES CONTINUE TO IMPACT EARNINGS ON THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY'S

EXPECTS THIS DECLINE TO BE MOST PRONOUNCED IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE FOREGOING STATEMENTS ARE FORWARD-LOOKING. INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET COULD DIFFER FROM EXPECTED LEVELS BECAUSE

OF SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING CERTAIN OF THOSE SET FORTH BELOW IN THE SUBSECTION ENTITLED "FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION." ADDITIONALLY, ACTUAL FUTURE INTEREST AND

OTHER INCOME, NET MAY BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY UNFORESEEN CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM AND

LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2002 WAS 25% COMPARED TO THE HIGHER STATUTORY RATE DUE PRIMARILY TO THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT AND THE REVERSAL OF VALUATION

ALLOWANCES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARISING FROM DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TAX LOSSES, AND TAX CREDITS OF $369 MILLION BEFORE BEING OFFSET

AGAINST CERTAIN DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES FOR PRESENTATION ON THE COMPANY'S BALANCE SHEET. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED

AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $30 MILLION

WAS RECORDED AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR THE BENEFITS OF TAX LOSSES THAT MAY NOT BE REALIZED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES PRINCIPALLY TO THE OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS ACQUIRED FROM NEXT

AND OTHER ACQUISITIONS, THE UTILIZATION OF WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE REALIZABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS QUARTERLY BY ASSESSING THE NEED FOR AND AMOUNT OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

32

THE

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) HAS COMPLETED AUDITS OF THE COMPANY'S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS THROUGH 1997. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL IRS AUDIT ISSUES FOR YEARS THROUGH 1997 HAVE BEEN RESOLVED.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JUNE 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED SFAS NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS

, WHICH ADDRESSES FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE ASSOCIATED

ASSET RETIREMENT COSTS. THE STANDARD APPLIES TO LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT RESULT FROM THE ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT AND/OR

NORMAL USE OF THE ASSET. SFAS NO. 143 REQUIRES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT IS INCURRED IF A REASONABLE ESTIMATE

OF FAIR VALUE CAN BE MADE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY IS ADDED TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSOCIATED ASSET AND THIS ADDITIONAL CARRYING AMOUNT IS DEPRECIATED OVER THE LIFE OF THE ASSET. THE

COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 143 FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF ITS FISCAL 2003. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 143 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN

AUGUST 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED SFAS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS

(STATEMENT 144), WHICH SUPERSEDES BOTH SFAS NO. 121,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF

AND THE

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING PROVISIONS OF APB OPINION NO. 30 (OPINION 30),

REPORTING THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONSREPORTING THE EFFECTS OF DISPOSAL OF A SEGMENT OF

A BUSINESS, AND EXTRAORDINARY, UNUSUAL AND INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING EVENTS AND TRANSACTIONS

, FOR THE DISPOSAL OF A SEGMENT OF A BUSINESS (AS PREVIOUSLY DEFINED IN THAT OPINION).

SFAS NO. 144 RETAINS THE FUNDAMENTAL PROVISIONS IN SFAS NO. 121 FOR RECOGNIZING AND MEASURING IMPAIRMENT LOSSES ON LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR USE AND LONG-LIVED

ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF BY SALE, WHILE ALSO RESOLVING SIGNIFICANT IMPLEMENTATION ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH SFAS NO. 121. FOR EXAMPLE, SFAS NO. 144 PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW A

LONG-LIVED ASSET THAT IS USED AS PART OF A GROUP SHOULD BE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT, ESTABLISHES CRITERIA FOR WHEN A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS HELD FOR SALE, AND PRESCRIBES THE

ACCOUNTING FOR A LONG-LIVED ASSET THAT WILL BE DISPOSED OF OTHER THAN BY SALE. SFAS NO. 144 RETAINS THE BASIC PROVISIONS OF OPINION 30 ON HOW TO PRESENT DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS IN

THE INCOME STATEMENT BUT BROADENS THAT PRESENTATION TO INCLUDE A COMPONENT OF AN ENTITY (RATHER THAN A SEGMENT OF A BUSINESS). UNLIKE SFAS NO. 121, AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT UNDER SFAS

NO. 144 WILL NEVER RESULT IN A WRITE-DOWN OF GOODWILL. RATHER, GOODWILL IS EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT UNDER SFAS NO. NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

THE

COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 144 FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF ITS FISCAL 2003. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 144 FOR

LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR USE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BECAUSE THE IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT UNDER SFAS NO. 144 IS LARGELY UNCHANGED FROM SFAS

NO. 121. THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 144 FOR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR OTHER DISPOSAL GENERALLY ARE REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY AFTER THE ADOPTION DATE TO NEWLY INITIATED DISPOSAL

ACTIVITIES.

IN

JUNE 2002, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED SFAS NO. 146,

ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL

ACTIVITIES

. SFAS NO. 146 SUPERSEDES EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 94-3,

LIABILITY RECOGNITION FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE

TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER COSTS TO EXIT AN ACTIVITY (INCLUDING CERTAIN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A RESTRUCTURING)

AND REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR A COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN

EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITY BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED, AS OPPOSED TO WHEN MANAGEMENT IS COMMITTED TO AN EXIT PLAN. SFAS NO. 146 ALSO ESTABLISHES THAT THE LIABILITY SHOULD

INITIALLY BE MEASURED AND RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THIS STATEMENT IS EFFECTIVE FOR EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES INITIATED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 146 ARE

REQUIRED TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY AFTER THE ADOPTION DATE TO NEWLY INITIATED EXIT ACTIVITIES, AND MAY AFFECT THE TIMING OF RECOGNIZING FUTURE RESTRUCTURING COSTS, AS WELL AS THE AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED.

AS

OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD $4.337 BILLION IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED FROM THE END OF FISCAL 2001. THE PRIMARY

SOURCES OF TOTAL CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN FISCAL 2002 WERE $89 MILLION IN CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND $105 MILLION IN PROCEEDS

FROM THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS, OFFSET BY CASH UTILIZED FOR BUSINESS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS OF $52 MILLION AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OF $174 MILLION.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES ITS EXISTING BALANCES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY ITS WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, STOCK

REPURCHASE ACTIVITY, OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS, AND OTHER LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EXISTING OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS ON NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES OF $464 MILLION, $209 MILLION OF WHICH RELATED TO

THE LEASE OF RETAIL SPACE AND RELATED FACILITIES. REMAINING TERMS ON THE COMPANY'S EXISTING OPERATING LEASES RANGE FROM 1 TO 12 YEARS. SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE COMPANY

ENTERED INTO ADDITIONAL OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS FOR RETAIL SPACE WITH FUTURE LEASE COMMITMENTS TOTALING $65 MILLION FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 5 TO 10 YEARS.

LONG-TERM DEBT

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS LONG-TERM DEBT OUTSTANDING IN THE FORM OF $300 MILLION OF AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT 6.5% UNSECURED NOTES. THE NOTES WERE SOLD AT

99.925% OF PAR, FOR AN EFFECTIVE YIELD TO MATURITY OF 6.51%. THE NOTES PAY INTEREST SEMIANNUALLY AND MATURE ON FEBRUARY 15, 2004.

PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS

THE COMPANY UTILIZES SEVERAL CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND TO PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF FINISHED

PRODUCTS. THESE CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ACQUIRE COMPONENTS AND BUILD PRODUCT BASED ON DEMAND INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH TYPICALLY COVERS PERIODS RANGING FROM 1 TO 3 MONTHS. THE COMPANY

ALSO OBTAINS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF FORMAL

PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH FORMAL AND INFORMAL PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY'S FORECASTED COMPONENT AND

MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 130 DAYS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURING COMMITMENTS AND COMPONENT PURCHASE

COMMITMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $525 MILLION.

34

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

OF TOTAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2002 OF $174 MILLION, $106 MILLION WAS FOR RETAIL STORE FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT AND

$68 MILLION WAS FOR CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENTS AND OPERATING FACILITIES ENHANCEMENTS AND EXPANSIONS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES IT WILL UTILIZE

APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION FOR CAPITAL EXPENDITURES DURING 2003, APPROXIMATELY $77 MILLION OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE UTILIZED FOR FURTHER EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT AND

THE REMAINDER UTILIZED TO SUPPORT NORMAL REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING CAPITAL ASSETS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO GENERAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE.

STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN

IN JULY 1999, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PLAN FOR THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE UP TO $500 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK. THIS REPURCHASE PLAN DOES

NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES OR ACQUIRE SHARES OVER ANY SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. DURING 2002 AND 2001, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED NO COMMON SHARES. HOWEVER, DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FORWARD PURCHASE AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE 1.5 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK IN SEPTEMBER OF 2003 AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $16.64 PER SHARE

FOR A TOTAL COST OF $25.5 MILLION. SINCE INCEPTION OF THE REPURCHASE PLAN, THE COMPANY HAS REPURCHASED OR COMMITTED TO REPURCHASE A TOTAL OF 6.55 MILLION SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK AT A

COST OF $217 MILLION.

NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS HELD SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN ARM, SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD, AKAMAI, AND EARTHLINK. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEETS AS NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE REQUIRING THAT THEY BE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS

AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED IN EQUITY AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ALL REALIZED GAINS ON THE SALE OF THESE INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN OTHER INCOME. THE COMBINED FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS WAS $39 MILLION,

$128 MILLION, AND $786 MILLION AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2002, 2001, AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS LIKELY THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN THE FUTURE.

FURTHER

INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTE 2 OF NOTES

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION, PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE

CONSIDERED TO BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT USE HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND CURRENT ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON GENERAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. FOR MUCH OF THE PAST 3 YEARS, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS HAS BEEN

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY WORSENING GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. CONTINUED UNCERTAINTY ABOUT FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CONTINUES TO MAKE IT DIFFICULT TO FORECAST FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. SHOULD GLOBAL

AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS FAIL TO IMPROVE OR CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS COULD CONTINUE TO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AS COULD THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF ITS SUPPLIERS,

DISTRIBUTORS, AND RESELLERS.

THE

TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT TOOK PLACE ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, DISRUPTED COMMERCE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND CREATED MANY ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT HAVE HAD A STRONG NEGATIVE IMPACT

ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY. THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 ATTACKS ON THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION REMAIN UNKNOWN. THE NATIONAL AND

INTERNATIONAL RESPONSES TO TERRORIST ATTACKS, THE POTENTIAL FOR FUTURE TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER ACTS OF HOSTILITY, AND THE POTENTIAL FOR

35

WAR IN THE MIDDLE EAST HAVE CREATED ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE.

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE PRICING PRACTICES, DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGINS, FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW

PRODUCTS, SHORT PRODUCT

LIFE CYCLES, CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT PRICE/PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS, PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS, AND A LARGE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, PRICE

COMPETITION IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE. THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS WHO SELL WINDOWS-BASED PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED THEIR

PRODUCT MARGINS IN ORDER TO GAIN OR MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE IN RESPONSE TO WEAKNESS IN DEMAND FOR PERSONAL COMPUTING PRODUCTS THAT BEGAN IN THE SECOND HALF OF CALENDAR 2000. THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE AND OTHER INDUSTRY-WIDE PRICING PRESSURES AND DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON GROSS MARGINS.

THE

PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY HAS ALSO BEEN CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITY, HARDWARE PERFORMANCE, AND FEATURES BASED ON EXISTING OR EMERGING INDUSTRY

STANDARDS. FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS PLACE MORE RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT ARE SMALLER AND SIMPLER THAN TRADITIONAL

PERSONAL COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH THE COMPANY'S EXISTING PRODUCTS. SEVERAL COMPETITORS OF THE COMPANY HAVE EITHER TARGETED OR ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION TO TARGET CERTAIN OF THE

COMPANY'S KEY MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING CONSUMER, EDUCATION, PROFESSIONAL AND CONSUMER DIGITAL VIDEO EDITING, AND DESIGN AND PUBLISHING. ADDITIONALLY, SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS HAVE

INTRODUCED OR ANNOUNCED PLANS TO INTRODUCE PRODUCTS THAT MIMIC MANY OF THE UNIQUE DESIGN, TECHNICAL FEATURES, AND SOLUTIONS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS MANY SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITORS,

MANY OF WHOM HAVE GREATER FINANCIAL, MARKETING, MANUFACTURING, AND TECHNOLOGICAL RESOURCES, AS WELL AS BROADER PRODUCT LINES AND LARGER INSTALLED CUSTOMER BASES THAN THOSE OF THE COMPANY.

ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARDS CONSOLIDATION IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY THAT HAS RESULTED IN LARGER AND POTENTIALLY STRONGER COMPETITORS IN THE COMPANY'S MARKETS.

THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY MAKER OF HARDWARE USING THE MAC OS. THE MAC OS HAS A MINORITY MARKET SHARE IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET, WHICH IS DOMINATED BY MAKERS OF COMPUTERS UTILIZING

MICROSOFT'S WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS. THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MACINTOSH

PLATFORM IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN PERCEIVED DESIGN AND FUNCTIONAL ADVANTAGES OVER COMPETING PLATFORMS, INCLUDING WINDOWS.

THE COMPANY HAS HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUES, THAN MANY OF COMPETITORS.

THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AND MAINTAIN ATTRACTIVE GROSS MARGINS IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY FLOW OF INNOVATIVE

AND COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGY TO THE MARKETPLACE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY INCURS HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE THAN ITS COMPETITORS WHO SELL WINDOWS-BASED

PERSONAL COMPUTERS. MANY OF THESE COMPETITORS SEEK TO COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY ON PRICE AND MAINTAIN VERY LOW COST STRUCTURES. FURTHER, AS A RESULT OF THE EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT AND

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MARKETING THE COMPANY'S BRAND INCLUDING ITS UNIQUE OPERATING SYSTEM, THE COMPANY INCURS HIGHER SELLING COSTS AS A PERCENT OF REVENUE THAN MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS. IF THE COMPANY

IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND SELL INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS WITH ATTRACTIVE GROSS MARGINS, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ITS OPERATING COST STRUCTURE.

36

THE COMPANY MUST SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS.

DUE TO THE HIGHLY VOLATILE NATURE OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY, WHICH IS CHARACTERIZED BY DYNAMIC CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE COMPANY

MUST CONTINUALLY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS IN ORDER TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE. THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS IS DEPENDENT ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING MARKET ACCEPTANCE, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, THE AVAILABILITY OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR NEW PRODUCTS, THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF

INVENTORY LEVELS IN LINE WITH ANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEMAND, THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN APPROPRIATE QUANTITIES TO MEET ANTICIPATED DEMAND, AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER

DEFECTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE IN ADVANCE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT THAT NEW PRODUCTS WILL HAVE ON ITS SALES OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DURING

2001, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED A NEW CLIENT OPERATING SYSTEM, MAC OS X, AND DELIVERED ITS FIRST MAJOR UPGRADE, MAC OS X VERSION 10.1. DURING 2002, THE COMPANY DELIVERED ANOTHER MAJOR UPGRADE, MAC

OS X JAGUAR. INABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO IMPROVE THE PERFORMANCE AND FUNCTIONALITY OF MAC OS X, ADVANCE CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF THE NEW OPERATING SYSTEM AND ITS UPGRADES, OR OBTAIN THE CONTINUED

COMMITMENT OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO TRANSITION EXISTING APPLICATIONS TO RUN ON MAC OS X OR CREATE NEW APPLICATIONS TO RUN ON MAC OS X, MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

BECAUSE ORDERS FOR COMPONENTS, AND IN SOME CASES COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE COMPONENTS, MUST BE PLACED IN ADVANCE OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY RISK.

THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE

AND ACCRUES NECESSARY RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION FEES OF ORDERS FOR INVENTORIES THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELED. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS INVENTORY AND RELATED PROVISIONS ARE ADEQUATE, GIVEN THE RAPID

AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL INVENTORY AND RELATED CHARGES. IN ADDITION, SUCH CHARGES HAVE

HAD, AND MAY AGAIN HAVE, A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE

COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S MARKETS ARE VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES,

THERE IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND PRODUCE OR ORDER FROM THIRD PARTIES EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, COMPONENTS

ARE NORMALLY ACQUIRED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF FORMAL PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH FORMAL AND INFORMAL PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY'S FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 130 DAYS. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN IN

THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY LEVELS AND RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO OBTAIN A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS, SOME OF WHICH ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY OR AVAILABLE ONLY FROM LIMITED

SOURCES.

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND APPLICATION

SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ("ASICS") ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DRAM, TFT-LCD

FLAT-PANEL DISPLAYS, AND OPTICAL AND MAGNETIC DISK DRIVES), WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE AVAILABILITY

AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A

NEED FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IN SITUATIONS WHERE A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT UTILIZES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE

SUPPLIERS' YIELDS HAVE

37

MATURED. THE COMPANY AND OTHER PRODUCERS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY ALSO COMPETE FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE

COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY INCLUDING CERTAIN MICROPROCESSORS AND ASICS. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED

IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMPONENTS OTHER THAN THOSE CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY COMPONENT WERE TO BE DELAYED OR

CONSTRAINED ON A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE

COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PRODUCE AND MARKET COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS IS ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE ABILITY AND DESIRE OF IBM AND MOTOROLA, THE SOLE SUPPLIERS OF THE POWERPC RISC-BASED

MICROPROCESSOR FOR THE COMPANY'S MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, TO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF MICROPROCESSORS WITH PRICE/PERFORMANCE FEATURES THAT COMPARE FAVORABLY TO THOSE SUPPLIED TO THE

COMPANY'S COMPETITORS BY INTEL CORPORATION AND OTHER DEVELOPERS AND PRODUCERS OF MICROPROCESSORS USED BY PERSONAL COMPUTERS USING THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS. FURTHER, DESPITE ITS EFFORTS TO EDUCATE

THE MARKETPLACE TO THE CONTRARY, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT MANY OF ITS CURRENT AND POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS BELIEVE THAT THE RELATIVELY SLOWER MHZ RATING OR CLOCK SPEED OF THE MICROPROCESSORS IT UTILIZES

IN ITS MACINTOSH SYSTEMS COMPARES UNFAVORABLY TO THOSE UTILIZED BY WINDOWS-BASED SYSTEMS AND TRANSLATES TO SLOWER OVERALL SYSTEM PERFORMANCE. THERE HAVE BEEN INSTANCES IN RECENT YEARS WHERE THE

INABILITY OF THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE ADVANCED G4 AND G3 MICROPROCESSORS WITH HIGHER CLOCK SPEEDS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITY HAS HAD SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE EFFECTS ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. THE INABILITY IN THE FUTURE OF THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN MICROPROCESSORS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES WITH COMPETITIVE PRICE/PERFORMANCE FEATURES COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES, MANY OF WHOM ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

MANY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS OUTSOURCED MUCH OF ITS TRANSPORTATION AND

LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT. WHILE OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS MAY LOWER THE FIXED COST OF OPERATIONS, THEY ALSO REDUCE THE COMPANY'S

DIRECT CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT EFFECT SUCH DIMINISHED CONTROL WILL HAVE ON THE QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF THE PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED, OR THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE

COMPANY TO RESPOND TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS. MOREOVER, ALTHOUGH ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUCH MANUFACTURERS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT, THE COMPANY MAY REMAIN AT LEAST

INITIALLY RESPONSIBLE TO THE ULTIMATE CONSUMER FOR WARRANTY SERVICE OR IN THE EVENT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS. ANY UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEFECT OR WARRANTY LIABILITY, WHETHER PURSUANT TO ARRANGEMENTS WITH

CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR OTHERWISE, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FINAL

ASSEMBLY OF PRODUCTS SOLD BY THE COMPANY IS CONDUCTED IN THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN SACRAMENTO, CALIFORNIA, AND CORK, IRELAND, AND BY EXTERNAL VENDORS IN FULLERTON, CALIFORNIA,

TAIWAN, KOREA, THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA, AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC. CURRENTLY, MANUFACTURE OF MANY OF THE COMPONENTS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND FINAL ASSEMBLY OF ALL OF THE COMPANY'S

PORTABLE PRODUCTS INCLUDING POWERBOOKS, IBOOKS, AND THE IPOD IS PERFORMED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN TAIWAN. IF FOR ANY REASON MANUFACTURING OR LOGISTICS IN ANY OF THESE LOCATIONS IS DISRUPTED BY

REGIONAL ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, ENVIRONMENTAL, POLITICAL, OR MILITARY CONDITIONS OR EVENTS, THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS COULD EXPERIENCE QUALITY PROBLEMS THAT RESULT IN DECREASED NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFITS.

THE COMPANY SELLS HIGHLY COMPLEX HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT MAY CONTAIN DEFECTS IN DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE. SOPHISTICATED OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS

SUCH AS THE COMPANY SELLS OFTEN CONTAINS "BUGS" THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE WITH THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE. DEFECTS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THE COMPANY PURCHASES FROM THIRD

PARTIES THAT MAY BE BEYOND ITS CONTROL.

38

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT AND FIX ALL DEFECTS IN THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IT SELLS. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUES, LOSS OF REPUTATION, AND

SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE TO REMEDY.

THE COMPANY'S RETAIL INITIATIVE REQUIRES A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT AND COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES AND IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

SINCE MAY OF 2001, THE COMPANY HAS OPENED 51 RETAIL STORES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ANTICIPATES OPENING MORE STORES IN CALENDAR 2003. THE COMPANY'S RETAIL INITIATIVE HAS

REQUIRED SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INVENTORY, AND PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO ENTERED INTO SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LEASES COMMITMENTS FOR

RETAIL SPACE WITH LEASE TERMS RANGING FROM 5 TO 12 YEARS. THE COMPANY WOULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS SHOULD IT CHOOSE TO TERMINATE THIS INITIATIVE OR CLOSE INDIVIDUAL STORES. SUCH COSTS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ADDITIONALLY, A RELATIVELY HIGH PROPORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S COSTS ARE FIXED BECAUSE OF DEPRECIATION ON STORE

CONSTRUCTIONS COSTS AND LEASE EXPENSE. AS A RESULT, SHOULD THE RETAIL SEGMENT EXPERIENCE A DECLINE IN SALES FOR ANY REASON, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES WOULD RESULT.

CERTAIN

OF THE COMPANY'S STORES HAVE BEEN INTENTIONALLY DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SERVE AS HIGH PROFILE VENUES THAT FUNCTION AS VEHICLES FOR GENERAL CORPORATE MARKETING, CORPORATE EVENTS, AND BRAND

AWARENESS. BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN ELEMENTS, LOCATIONS AND SIZE, THESE STORES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS THAN THE COMPANY'S TYPICAL RETAIL

STORES. THE COMPANY HAS OPENED TWO SUCH STORES AND HAS SEVERAL OTHERS UNDER DEVELOPMENT. BECAUSE OF THEIR LOCATION AND SIZE, THESE HIGH PROFILE STORES ALSO REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO ENTER INTO

SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS COMPARED TO THOSE REQUIRED FOR ITS MORE TYPICAL STORES. CURRENT LEASES ON SUCH LOCATIONS HAVE TERMS RANGING FROM 5 TO 10 YEARS WITH TOTAL

COMMITMENTS PER LOCATION OVER THE LEASE TERMS RANGING FROM $25 MILLION TO $50 MILLION. CLOSURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF THESE HIGH PROFILE STORES COULD HAVE A PARTICULARLY

SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MANY

OF THE GENERAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THE COMPANY FACES COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS RETAIL SEGMENT. ALSO, MANY FACTORS UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS PRESENT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES,

SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S FUTURE RESULTS, CAUSE ITS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY EXPECTED, AND/OR HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RETAIL SEGMENT INCLUDE, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON GENERAL RETAIL ACTIVITY; INABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STORE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION; LACK OF CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE OF

THE COMPANY'S RETAIL APPROACH; FAILURE TO ATTRACT NEW USERS TO THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM; INABILITY TO SELL THIRD-PARTY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AT ADEQUATE MARGINS; FAILURE TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS

WITH EXISTING RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS; LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING RETAIL OPERATIONS; COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY RETAIL

INVENTORY; AND INABILITY TO OBTAIN QUALITY RETAIL LOCATIONS AT REASONABLE COST.

UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PROFESSIONALLY ORIENTED DESKTOP SYSTEMS HAVE DECLINED SHARPLY OVER PAST TWO TO THREE YEARS NEGATIVELY IMPACTING NET SALES AND GROSS MARGIN.

UNIT SALES OF POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS FELL 18% DURING 2002 AS COMPARED TO 2001 AND FELL 35% IN 2001 FROM 2000. POWER MACINTOSH UNIT SALES HAVE FALLEN AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL

MACINTOSH UNIT SALES FROM 38% IN 1999 TO 25% IN 2002. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS ARE HAVING A PRONOUNCED NEGATIVE IMPACT ON ITS PROFESSIONAL AND

CREATIVE CUSTOMERS WHO ARE THE PRIMARY USERS OF SUCH SYSTEMS. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES THAT MANY OF THESE CUSTOMERS CONTINUE TO DELAY UPGRADES OF THEIR POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS DUE TO THE COMPANY'S

ONGOING TRANSITION TO MAC OS X AND IN ANTICIPATION OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE VENDORS TRANSITIONING THEIR PROFESSIONALLY ORIENTED MACINTOSH SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS TO RUN NATIVELY IN MAC OS X. IN ADDITION TO

THE NEGATIVE IMPACT ON NET SALES, DECLINING SALES OF POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S OVERALL GROSS MARGIN BECAUSE POWER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS ARE GENERALLY HIGHER

PRICED AND HAVE HIGHER INDIVIDUAL GROSS MARGINS THAN THE

39

COMPANY'S OTHER MACINTOSH SYSTEMS. CONTINUED DETERIORATION IN POWER MACINTOSH UNIT SALES WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE NET SALES AND GROSS MARGIN. IF FUTURE UNIT SALES OF POWER MACINTOSH

SYSTEMS FAIL TO PARTIALLY OR FULLY RECOVER, IT WILL BE DIFFICULT FOR THE COMPANY TO IMPROVE ITS OVERALL PROFITABILITY.

THE COMPANY FACES INCREASING COMPETITION IN THE U.S. EDUCATION MARKET.

SALES IN THE UNITED STATES TO BOTH ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS FOR COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CUSTOMERS, REMAINS A CORE MARKET FOR APPLE. NET SALES IN THESE

MARKETS FELL TO 21% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL NET SALES IN 2002 FROM 26% IN 2001. THIS DROP REFLECTS DECLINES IN BOTH NET SALES AND MACINTOSH UNIT SALES IN THESE MARKETS OF 15% AND 14%, RESPECTIVELY, IN

FISCAL 2002 COMPARED TO 2001. THESE DEVELOPMENTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY DATA SHOWING THE COMPANY LOSING MARKET SHARE IN THE U.S. EDUCATION MARKET IN EACH OF THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS. SEVERAL

COMPETITORS OF THE COMPANY HAVE EITHER TARGETED OR ANNOUNCED THEIR INTENTION TO TARGET THE EDUCATION MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN CERTAIN STEPS TO STRENGTHEN ITS

POSITION IN THE EDUCATION MARKET, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO INCREASE ITS SHARE OF THE EDUCATION MARKET OR MAINTAIN ITS EXISTING SHARE OF THAT MARKET. FAILURE TO

INCREASE OR MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE IN THE EDUCATION MARKET MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER RESELLERS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS AND CATALOGUERS, MANY OF WHOM DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS FROM COMPETING

MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND RESELLS CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO END USERS, CERTAIN EDUCATION CUSTOMERS, AND

CERTAIN RESELLERS THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS ITS OWN PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS THROUGH ITS RETAIL STORES IN THE UNITED STATES. MANY OF THE

COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT RESELLERS OPERATE ON NARROW PRODUCT MARGINS AND HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL OR

CREDIT INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF

THESE RESELLERS WEAKENED, IF RESELLERS WITHIN CONSUMER CHANNELS WERE TO CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, OR IF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS CAUSED RESELLERS TO

REDUCE THEIR ORDERING AND MARKETING OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS.

FURTHER

INFORMATION REGARDING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION MAY BE FOUND IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING "MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION,"

WHICH INFORMATION IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

A LARGE PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE

SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND LABOR CONDITIONS, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, TAX LAWS (INCLUDING U.S. TAXES ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES), AND

CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS THE LOCAL CURRENCY IN WHICH THE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AND GOODS AND SERVICES ARE PURCHASED. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATE TO NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED SALES IN

EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, AND CERTAIN PARTS OF ASIA AND NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED OPERATING EXPENSES INCURRED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WEAKNESSES IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PARTICULARLY THE

JAPANESE YEN AND THE EURO, CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES. CONVERSELY, STRENGTHENING IN

THESE AND OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCIES CAN INCREASE THE COST TO THE COMPANY OF PRODUCT COMPONENTS, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

40

MARGINS

ON SALES OF APPLE PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES.

FURTHER

INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL MARKET RISKS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 7A OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE SUBHEADING "FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK" AND MAY BE

FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTES 1 AND 2 OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH INFORMATION IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT UPON SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DECISIONS BY CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANY'S PERSONAL COMPUTERS, AS OPPOSED TO WINDOWS-BASED SYSTEMS, ARE OFTEN BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF

THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE FOR PARTICULAR APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MICROSOFT OFFICE. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN

PART ON THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS' PERCEPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING, MAINTAINING, AND UPGRADING SUCH SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VERSUS SOFTWARE FOR THE LARGER

WINDOWS MARKET. THIS ANALYSIS IS BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE PERCEIVED STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTS, THE ANTICIPATED POTENTIAL REVENUE THAT MAY BE GENERATED, ACCEPTANCE BY CUSTOMERS OF

MAC OS X, AND THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING SUCH SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL LOSSES IN PRIOR YEARS AND THE MINORITY MARKET SHARE HELD BY THE COMPANY IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER

MARKET, AS WELL AS THE COMPANY'S DECISION TO END ITS MAC OS LICENSING PROGRAM, HAVE CAUSED SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO QUESTION THE COMPANY'S PROSPECTS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET, DEVELOPERS COULD BE

LESS INCLINED TO DEVELOP NEW APPLICATION SOFTWARE OR UPGRADE EXISTING SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND MORE INCLINED TO DEVOTE THEIR RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING AND UPGRADING SOFTWARE FOR THE

LARGER WINDOWS MARKET. IN ADDITION, PAST AND FUTURE DEVELOPMENT BY THE COMPANY OF ITS OWN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SOLUTIONS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DECISION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO DEVELOP,

MAINTAIN, AND UPGRADE SIMILAR OR COMPETITIVE SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. MOREOVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE FOR MAC OS X, THE COMPANY'S

NEW OPERATING SYSTEM, ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL.

IN

AUGUST 1997, THE COMPANY AND MICROSOFT CORPORATION ENTERED INTO PATENT CROSS LICENSE AND TECHNOLOGY AGREEMENTS. IN ADDITION, FOR A PERIOD OF FIVE YEARS THROUGH AUGUST 2002, AND

SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS RELATED TO THE NUMBER OF MACINTOSH COMPUTERS SOLD BY THE COMPANY, MICROSOFT WAS

REQUIRED TO MAKE VERSIONS OF ITS MICROSOFT OFFICE AND INTERNET EXPLORER PRODUCTS FOR THE MAC OS. ALTHOUGH MICROSOFT HAS RELEASED MICROSOFT OFFICE AND INTERNET EXPLORER FOR MAC OS X, MICROSOFT IS NOT

OBLIGATED TO PRODUCE FUTURE VERSIONS OF ITS PRODUCTS SUBSEQUENT TO AUGUST 2002. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH MICROSOFT HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE BENEFICIAL TO THE

COMPANY AND TO ITS EFFORTS TO INCREASE THE INSTALLED BASE FOR THE MAC OS, THE COMPANY DOES COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH MICROSOFT IN A NUMBER OF KEY AREAS. ACCORDINGLY, MICROSOFT'S INTEREST IN PRODUCING

APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR THE MAC OS FOLLOWING EXPIRATION OF THE AGREEMENTS MAY BE INFLUENCED BY MICROSOFT'S PERCEPTION OF ITS INTERESTS AS THE VENDOR OF THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM. DISCONTINUANCE OF

MICROSOFT OFFICE AND OTHER MICROSOFT PRODUCTS FOR THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S NET SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS RELIES ON ACCESS TO PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND THE COMPANY'S FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF IT IS

ALLEGED OR FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.

MANY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES

RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY

REASONABLE TERMS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE OR AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.

41

BECAUSE

OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY, CURRENT EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS

AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE EXISTING PATENTS OF OTHERS. THE COMPANY HAS FROM TIME TO TIME BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS OF OTHERS. RESPONDING TO SUCH CLAIMS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR MERIT, CAN BE TIME CONSUMING, RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, AND CAUSE THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. SEVERAL

PENDING CLAIMS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EVALUATION. THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER THE DESIRABILITY OF ENTERING INTO LICENSING AGREEMENTS IN CERTAIN OF THESE CASES. HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT

SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR THAT LITIGATION WILL NOT OCCUR. IN THE EVENT THERE IS A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION ENTERED PROHIBITING THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING OR SELLING

CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS OR A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT AGAINST THE COMPANY REQUIRING IT TO PAY ROYALTIES TO A THIRD-PARTY, THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD

BE ADVERSELY EFFECTED. INFORMATION REGARDING CLAIMS AND POTENTIAL LITIGATION INVOLVING THE COMPANY RELATED TO ALLEGED PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND OTHER MATTERS IS SET FORTH IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF

THIS FORM 10-K. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES FROM ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS RELATED TO THE

INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF SUCH

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THE MATTERS RELATED TO INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS

DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A

PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS QUARTERLY REVENUES AND OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.

THE COMPANY'S PROFIT MARGINS VARY AMONG ITS PRODUCTS, ITS GEOGRAPHIC MARKETS, AND ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. AS A RESULT, THE OVERALL PROFITABILITY OF THE COMPANY IN ANY GIVEN

PERIOD WILL DEPEND, IN PART, ON THE PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIC, AND CHANNEL MIX REFLECTED IN THAT PERIOD'S NET SALES.

THE TYPICAL CONCENTRATION OF NET SALES IN THE THIRD MONTH OF THE COMPANY'S FISCAL QUARTERS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY GENERALLY SELLS MORE PRODUCTS DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF EACH QUARTER THAN IT DOES DURING EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO MONTHS, A PATTERN TYPICAL IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER

INDUSTRY. THIS SALES PATTERN CAN PRODUCE PRESSURE ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF A QUARTER AND MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PREDICT ITS FINANCIAL

RESULTS ACCURATELY. DEVELOPMENTS LATE IN A QUARTER, SUCH AS LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, AN INTERNAL SYSTEMS FAILURE, OR FAILURE OF ONE OF THE

COMPANY'S KEY LOGISTICS OR COMPONENTS SUPPLIERS, CAN HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACTS ON THE COMPANY AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY'S SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS OF THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING THOSE IN TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF POSITIONS.

EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY, WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S

EMPLOYEES ARE LOCATED. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT AND RETAIN THE KEY PERSONNEL IT NEEDS. ADDITIONALLY, VOLATILITY OR A LACK OF POSITIVE PERFORMANCE

IN THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS ABILITY TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS WERE

OUT-OF-THE-MONEY.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF INSURANCE.

THE COMPANY HAS OBSERVED RAPIDLY CHANGING CONDITIONS IN THE INSURANCE MARKETS RELATING TO NEARLY ALL AREAS OF TRADITIONAL CORPORATE INSURANCE. SUCH CONDITIONS HAVE RESULTED IN

HIGHER PREMIUM COSTS, HIGHER POLICY DEDUCTIBLES, AND LOWER COVERAGE LIMITS. FOR SOME RISKS, BECAUSE OF COST AND/OR AVAILABILITY, THE

42

COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE. FOR THESE REASONS, THE COMPANY IS RETAINING A GREATER PORTION OF ITS INSURABLE RISKS THAN IT HAS IN THE PAST AT RELATIVELY GREATER COST.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES. THIS RISK IS HEIGHTENED AS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORSEN.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER RESELLERS AND RETAILERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. A

SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL OR CREDIT INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF ITS

MANUFACTURING VENDORS RESULTING FROM THE SALE BY THE COMPANY OF RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS TO THESE MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE

COMPANY. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO MONITOR AND LIMIT EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE AND NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES, THERE CAN BE ASSURANCE THAT SUCH PROCEDURES WILL BE

EFFECTIVE IN LIMITING ITS CREDIT RISK AND AVOIDING LOSSES. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY AND REGIONAL ECONOMIES FAIL TO IMPROVE OR CONTINUE TO DETERIORATE, IT BECOMES MORE LIKELY THAT THE

COMPANY WILL INCUR A MATERIAL LOSS OR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING FINANCIAL CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE OF ITS CUSTOMERS OR MANUFACTURING VENDORS.

THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY.

THE COMPANY HOLDS MINORITY INVESTMENTS IN SEVERAL PUBLIC COMPANIES WITH A COMBINED FAIR MARKET VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $39 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002. THESE

INVESTMENTS ARE IN PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES WHOSE SHARE PRICES ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY. THE COMPANY HAS CATEGORIZED ITS INVESTMENTS IN THESE COMPANIES AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE REQUIRING THE INVESTMENTS BE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS WHEN IT IS JUDGED AN INVESTMENT HAS EXPERIENCED A DECLINE IN VALUE THAT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO ITS NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS TWICE IN THE LAST TWO FISCAL YEARS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.

PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE

REQUIREMENT THAT THE COMPANY PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH THE ABILITY TO RETURN TO THE COMPANY PRODUCT AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING

WITH THE COMPANY. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH

EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

THE

PARLIAMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS WORKING ON FINALIZING THE WASTE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT DIRECTIVE (THE DIRECTIVE). THE DIRECTIVE MAKES PRODUCERS OF ELECTRICAL GOODS, INCLUDING

PERSONAL COMPUTERS, FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COLLECTION, RECYCLING, AND SAFE DISPOSAL OF PAST AND FUTURE PRODUCTS. THE DIRECTIVE MUST NOW BE APPROVED AND IMPLEMENTED BY INDIVIDUAL EUROPEAN

UNION GOVERNMENTS BY JUNE 2004, WHILE THE PRODUCERS' FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS ARE SCHEDULED TO START JUNE 2005. THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE DIRECTIVE RELATED TO

PAST SALES OF ITS PRODUCTS AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH FUTURE SALES OF ITS PRODUCT MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL. HOWEVER, BECAUSE IT IS LIKELY THAT SPECIFIC

LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND ENFORCEMENT POLICIES WILL VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES, IT IS NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE COMPANY'S EXISTING LIABILITY OR FUTURE

EXPENSES RESULTING FROM THE DIRECTIVE. AS THE EUROPEAN UNION AND ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES CLARIFY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES WITH RESPECT TO THE DIRECTIVE, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO

ASSESS ITS POTENTIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT. SIMILAR LEGISLATION MAY BE ENACTED IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIES, INCLUDING FEDERAL AND STATE LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES, THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF WHICH COULD BE

SIGNIFICANT.

43

BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S MAJOR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERRUPTION BY EARTHQUAKE, FIRE, POWER SHORTAGES, TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER HOSTILE ACTS, LABOR DISPUTES, AND OTHER

EVENTS BEYOND ITS CONTROL. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, ITS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, AND OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN MAJOR COMPONENTS

SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS, ARE LOCATED NEAR MAJOR SEISMIC FAULTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CARRY EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE FOR DIRECT QUAKE-RELATED LOSSES. THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE OR OTHER NATURAL OR MANMADE DISASTER.

UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S TAX RATES COULD AFFECT ITS FUTURE RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE FAVORABLY OR UNFAVORABLY AFFECTED BY UNANTICIPATED CHANGES IN THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX

RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF THE COMPANY DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR BY CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION.

THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE.

THE COMPANY'S STOCK HAS AT TIMES EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY AS A RESULT OF VARIATIONS BETWEEN ITS ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND AS A RESULT OF

ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND ITS COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, THE STOCK MARKET HAS EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES

IN WAYS THAT HAVE BEEN UNRELATED TO THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THESE COMPANIES. THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS GENERAL ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS AND INVESTORS' CONCERNS REGARDING THE CREDIBILITY

OF CORPORATE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND INTEGRITY OF FINANCIAL MARKETS, MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK IN THE FUTURE.

44

ITEM 7A. DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

TO ENSURE THE ADEQUACY AND EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE HEDGE POSITIONS, AS WELL AS TO MONITOR THE RISKS AND OPPORTUNITIES OF THE

NON-HEDGE PORTFOLIOS, THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS, AND ITS INTEREST RATE SWAP AND OPTION POSITIONS BOTH ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS AND IN

CONJUNCTION WITH ITS UNDERLYING FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE RELATED EXPOSURES, RESPECTIVELY, FROM BOTH AN ACCOUNTING AND AN ECONOMIC PERSPECTIVE. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE EFFECTIVE HORIZONS OF THE

COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE ANTICIPATORY NATURE OF THE EXPOSURES INTENDED TO HEDGE, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE AFOREMENTIONED PROGRAMS WILL OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE

ADVERSE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN EITHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE OR INTEREST RATES. IN ADDITION, THE TIMING OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR RECOGNITION OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO

MARK-TO-MARKET INSTRUMENTS FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD MAY NOT COINCIDE WITH THE TIMING OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC EXPOSURES AND, THEREFORE, MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARD NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

, AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2000. SFAS NO. 133 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, AND EXPOSURE DEFINITION. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ONGOING APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 133 WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE COMPANY'S HEDGING STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, ITS APPLICATION MAY

INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INTEREST RATE RISK

WHILE THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN MANY OF THE WORLD'S LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY'S INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE IS MOST SENSITIVE

TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE GENERAL LEVEL OF U.S. INTEREST RATES. IN THIS REGARD, CHANGES IN U.S. INTEREST RATES AFFECT THE INTEREST EARNED ON THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AS WELL AS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES.

THE

COMPANY'S FIXED INCOME INVESTMENT POLICY AND STRATEGY IS TO ENSURE THE PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL, MEET LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, AND OPTIMIZE RETURN IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT CREDIT AND INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY BENCHMARKS ITS PERFORMANCE BY UTILIZING EXTERNAL MONEY MANAGERS TO MANAGE A SMALL PORTION OF THE AGGREGATE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE EXTERNAL MANAGERS ADHERE TO THE COMPANY'S

INVESTMENT POLICIES AND ALSO PROVIDE OCCASIONAL RESEARCH AND MARKET INFORMATION THAT SUPPLEMENTS INTERNAL RESEARCH USED TO MAKE CREDIT DECISIONS IN THE INVESTMENT PROCESS.

DURING

1994, THE COMPANY ISSUED $300 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.5% UNSECURED NOTES IN A PUBLIC OFFERING REGISTERED WITH THE SEC. THE NOTES WERE SOLD AT 99.925% OF PAR, FOR AN

EFFECTIVE YIELD TO MATURITY OF 6.51%. THE NOTES PAY INTEREST SEMIANNUALLY AND MATURE ON FEBRUARY 15, 2004.

THE

COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY PLACES ITS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES ISSUED BY HIGH CREDIT QUALITY ISSUERS AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE

ISSUER. THE COMPANY'S GENERAL POLICY IS TO LIMIT THE RISK OF PRINCIPAL LOSS AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF INVESTED FUNDS BY LIMITING MARKET AND CREDIT RISK. ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF

THREE MONTHS OR LESS ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS; HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, $1.087 BILLION OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WAS INVESTED IN U.S. AGENCY AND CORPORATE DEBT SECURITIES WITH

MATURITIES RANGING FROM 1 TO 5 YEARS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2001, $313 MILLION OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WAS IN U.S.

AGENCY SECURITIES WITH UNDERLYING MATURITIES RANGING FROM 1 TO 4 YEARS. THE REMAINDER ALL HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES BETWEEN 3 AND 12 MONTHS. DUE TO LIQUIDITY NEEDS, OR IN ANTICIPATION OF

CREDIT DETERIORATION, OR FOR THE PURPOSE OF DURATION MANAGEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S

45

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY MAY SELL INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO THEIR STATED MATURITIES. AS A RESULT OF SUCH ACTIVITY, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET GAINS OF $7 MILLION IN 2002 AND

$1 MILLION IN 2001.

IN

ORDER TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT THAT A

CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ASSUMING A 100 BASIS POINT PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE. BASED ON INVESTMENT POSITIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 28,

2002, A HYPOTHETICAL 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS ALL MATURITIES WOULD RESULT IN A $37.7 MILLION DECLINE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 29, 2001, A SIMILAR 100 BASIS POINT SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A $17.8 MILLION DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE. SUCH LOSSES WOULD ONLY BE REALIZED IF THE COMPANY

SOLD THE INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO MATURITY. EXCEPT IN INSTANCES NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY'S POLICY IS TO HOLD INVESTMENTS TO MATURITY.

THE

COMPANY SOMETIMES ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, COLLARS, AND FLOORS, WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER MATCH THE COMPANY'S

FLOATING-RATE INTEREST INCOME ON ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH ITS FIXED-RATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON ITS LONG-TERM DEBT, AND/OR TO

DIVERSIFY A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE AWAY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN SHORT-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS THAT ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE

THE COST OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM.

DURING

THE LAST TWO YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER MATCH THE COMPANY'S FLOATING-RATE INTEREST INCOME ON ITS CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH ITS FIXED-RATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON ITS LONG-TERM DEBT, AND/OR TO DIVERSIFY A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE AWAY FROM

FLUCTUATIONS IN SHORT-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES. THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WHICH QUALIFIED AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES, GENERALLY REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO PAY A FLOATING INTEREST RATE BASED ON THE

THREE- OR SIX-MONTH U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AND RECEIVE A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST WITHOUT EXCHANGES OF THE UNDERLYING NOTIONAL AMOUNTS. THESE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED THE COMPANY'S

FIXED-RATE 10-YEAR DEBT TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT AND CONVERT A PORTION OF THE FLOATING RATE INVESTMENTS TO FIXED RATE. DUE TO PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES, DURING

2002 THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AND THEN SUBSEQUENTLY CLOSED OUT DEBT SWAP POSITIONS REALIZING A GAIN OF $6 MILLION. DURING 2001

THE COMPANY CLOSED OUT ALL OF ITS THEN EXISTING DEBT SWAP POSITIONS REALIZING A GAIN OF $17 MILLION. BOTH THE GAINS IN 2001 AND 2002 WERE DEFERRED, RECOGNIZED IN LONG-TERM DEBT AND

ARE BEING AMORTIZED TO OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE DEBT. AT CERTAIN TIMES IN THE PAST, THE COMPANY HAS ALSO ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS THAT ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE

THE COST OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR TRANSACT IN SUCH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN RISK MANAGEMENT.

THE

COMPANY'S ASSET SWAPS DID NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AND WERE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET WITH ASSOCIATED GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME.

INTEREST RATE ASSET SWAPS OUTSTANDING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, HAD A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE RECEIVE RATE OF 5.50% AND A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE PAY RATE OF 6.66%. THE UNREALIZED LOSS ON THESE ASSETS SWAPS

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, OF $5.7 MILLION WAS DEFERRED AND THEN RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN 2001 AS PART OF THE SFAS NO. 133 TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT EFFECTIVE ON OCTOBER 1, 2000.

THE COMPANY CLOSED OUT ALL OF ITS EXISTING INTEREST RATE ASSET SWAPS DURING 2001 REALIZING A GAIN OF $1.1 MILLION.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

OVERALL, THE COMPANY IS A NET RECEIVER OF CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND, AS SUCH, BENEFITS FROM A WEAKER DOLLAR AND IS ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY A STRONGER DOLLAR

RELATIVE TO MAJOR CURRENCIES WORLDWIDE. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, AND IN PARTICULAR A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S NET SALES AND GROSS MARGINS AS

EXPRESSED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THERE IS ALSO A RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL HAVE TO ADJUST LOCAL CURRENCY PRODUCT PRICING WITHIN THE TIME FRAME OF OUR HEDGED POSITIONS DUE TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WHEN

THERE HAS BEEN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

46

THE

COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRIMARILY TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,

CERTAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, AND PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY'S PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY OF ITS EXISTING MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE

TRANSACTION EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY NOT HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES DUE TO IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES, AND LIMITED

AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE OF HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO ENTERS INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE

RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN RECORDED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OF ITS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES.

IN

ORDER TO PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE POSITIONS, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS

USING A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES. THE VAR MODEL CONSISTED OF USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TO GENERATE 3000

RANDOM MARKET PRICE PATHS. THE VALUE-AT-RISK IS THE MAXIMUM EXPECTED LOSS IN FAIR VALUE, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, TO THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE PORTFOLIO DUE TO

ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN RATES. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE MODEL

ASSUMES NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE

MODEL, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE OF $3.8 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002 COMPARED TO A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS

OF $6.8 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2001. BECAUSE THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS FOR HEDGING PURPOSES, LOSSES INCURRED ON THOSE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES.

ACTUAL

GAINS AND LOSSES IN THE FUTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED AS OF

SEPTEMBER 28, 2002 DUE TO THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PREDICTING THE CHANGES IN THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGES RATES, AND THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL

EXPOSURES AND POSITIONS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

APPLE

COMPUTER, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) DESIGNS, MANUFACTURES, AND MARKETS PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED PERSONAL COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATING SOLUTIONS FOR SALE PRIMARILY TO

EDUCATION, CREATIVE, CONSUMER, AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE PREPARATION OF THESE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THESE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

TYPICALLY,

THE COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF SEPTEMBER. FISCAL YEARS 2002 AND 2001 WERE EACH 52-WEEK YEARS. HOWEVER, APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS, THE COMPANY REPORTS

A 53-WEEK FISCAL YEAR TO ALIGN ITS FISCAL QUARTERS WITH CALENDAR QUARTERS BY ADDING A WEEK TO ITS FIRST FISCAL QUARTER. CONSEQUENTLY, AN ADDITIONAL WEEK WAS ADDED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF

FISCAL 2000. ALL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN IS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S FISCAL CALENDAR.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY PLACES ITS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN HIGHLY LIQUID SECURITIES ISSUED BY HIGH CREDIT QUALITY ISSUERS. ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF

THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS; HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND REEVALUATES SUCH DESIGNATION AS OF EACH

BALANCE SHEET DATE. THE COMPANY'S MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. THESE SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR

VALUE, WITH THE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. THE COST OF SECURITIES SOLD IS BASED UPON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

ON OCTOBER 1, 2000, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

. SFAS NO. 133 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AND EXPOSURE DEFINITION. SFAS

NO. 133 REQUIRES THAT ALL DERIVATIVES BE RECOGNIZED AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT HEDGES MUST BE ADJUSTED TO FAIR VALUE THROUGH INCOME. IF THE

DERIVATIVE IS A HEDGE, DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE HEDGE, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WILL EITHER BE OFFSET AGAINST THE CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED ASSETS, LIABILITIES, OR FIRM COMMITMENTS THROUGH

EARNINGS, OR RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL THE HEDGED ITEM IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. NET OF THE RELATED INCOME TAX EFFECT OF APPROXIMATELY $5 MILLION, ADOPTION OF SFAS

NO. 133 RESULTED IN A FAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT-TYPE ADJUSTMENT TO NET INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION. NET OF THE RELATED INCOME TAX EFFECT OF APPROXIMATELY

$5 MILLION, ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 133 RESULTED IN A FAVORABLE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT-TYPE ADJUSTMENT TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH

WAS RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS DURING 2001. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ONGOING APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 133 WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE COMPANY'S HEDGING STRATEGIES. HOWEVER, ITS

APPLICATION MAY INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A PARTICULAR RISK AND THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE NET GAIN OR

LOSS ON THE

53

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION

AFFECTS EARNINGS. TO RECEIVE HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES TO EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY OR AN IDENTIFIED PORTION THEREOF THAT ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO A PARTICULAR RISK AND THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR

VALUE HEDGES, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT

PERIOD. THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT THAT IS DESIGNATED AS AN ECONOMIC HEDGE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EXPOSURE OF THE NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN

OPERATION IS REPORTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS A FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. FOR FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THE COMPANY EXCLUDES CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RELATING TO

CHANGES IN THE FORWARD CARRY

COMPONENT FROM ITS DEFINITION OF EFFECTIVENESS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THIS COMPONENT ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.

FOR

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE FORWARD

EXCHANGE RATE. CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON THE FORECASTED HEDGED TRANSACTION AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD HEDGE ARE BOTH MEASURED FROM THE CONTRACT RATE TO THE FORWARD

EXCHANGE RATE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORWARD CONTRACT'S MATURITY DATE. FOR CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON CHANGES IN TOTAL FAIR VALUE

OF THE OPTION CONTRACT. HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BY COMPARING THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS ON THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS DETERMINED AS THE SUM OF THE

PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED OUTCOMES WITH RESPECT TO THE OPTION STRIKE RATES WITH THE TOTAL CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTION HEDGE. FOR INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS QUALIFYING AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE

COMPANY ASSUMES NO INEFFECTIVENESS BECAUSE THESE SWAPS MEET THE CRITERIA FOR ACCOUNTING UNDER THE SHORT-CUT METHOD DEFINED IN SFAS NO. 133.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST (FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT) OR MARKET. IF THE COST OF THE INVENTORIES EXCEEDS THEIR MARKET VALUE, PROVISIONS ARE

MADE CURRENTLY FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND THE MARKET VALUE.

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED BY USE OF THE DECLINING BALANCE AND STRAIGHT-LINE METHODS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH ARE 30 YEARS FOR BUILDINGS, FROM 2 TO 5 YEARS FOR EQUIPMENT, AND THE SHORTER OF LEASE TERMS OR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES FOR LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS. THE COMPANY

CAPITALIZES ELIGIBLE COSTS TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE THAT ARE INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE. CAPITALIZED COSTS RELATED TO INTERNAL-USE

SOFTWARE ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH RANGE FROM 3 TO 5 YEARS.

PRIOR

TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001, THE COMPANY HAD CLASSIFIED CAPITALIZED COSTS RELATED TO INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE ON THE BALANCE SHEET IN OTHER ASSETS. EFFECTIVE AS OF

SEPTEMBER 29, 2001, AND FOR ALL OTHER PERIODS PRESENTED, THE COMPANY HAS RECLASSIFIED INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE TO PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND RECLASSIFIED RELATED CASH FLOWS FOR

THE PURCHASE OR DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE FROM CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO CASH FLOW FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES.

54

NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS

INVESTMENTS CATEGORIZED AS NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ARE IN EQUITY AND DEBT INSTRUMENTS OF PUBLIC COMPANIES. THEY

ARE NOT CATEGORIZED AS CURRENT ASSETS EITHER BECAUSE, GIVEN THEIR NATURE, THEY ARE NOT READILY CONVERTIBLE INTO CASH OR BECAUSE THEY REPRESENT POTENTIALLY LONGER-TERM INVESTMENTS BY THE

COMPANY. FURTHER, THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS HAS BEEN SUBJECT TO A HIGH DEGREE OF VOLATILITY. THE COMPANY'S NON-CURRENT DEBT AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN CATEGORIZED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE REQUIRING THAT THEY BE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED IN EQUITY AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN THE EVENT A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW THE COST BASIS OF ONE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS DETERMINED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. THE COMPANY INCLUDES RECOGNIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE SALE OR FROM OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINES IN FAIR VALUE

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE INVESTMENTS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. OCCASIONALLY, THE COMPANY USES SHORT-TERM EQUITY DERIVATIVES TO MANAGE POTENTIAL DISPOSITIONS OF NON-CURRENT DEBT

AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. ANY GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED CURRENTLY IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES, EXCLUDING GOODWILL, FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF THESE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO

GENERATE. IF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED EQUALS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE COMPANY HAS MADE NO MATERIAL ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS EXCEPT THOSE MADE IN

CONNECTION WITH THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5.

THE

COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

, IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2002. SFAS NO. 142 REQUIRES THAT

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR SOONER WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT THEY MAY BE IMPAIRED. PRIOR TO FISCAL 2002, GOODWILL WAS AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER ITS ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS TRANSITIONAL AND

ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTS AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2001, AND AUGUST 30, 2002, RESPECTIVELY, AND FOUND NO IMPAIRMENT. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED REPORTING UNITS BASED ON ITS CURRENT REPORTING

STRUCTURE. FOR PURPOSES OF TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, GOODWILL HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THESE REPORTING UNITS TO THE EXTENT IT RELATES TO EACH REPORTING UNIT.

SFAS

NO. 142 ALSO REQUIRES THAT INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF

. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

AMORTIZING ITS ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM 3 TO 7 YEARS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE COMPANY TRANSLATES THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS INTERNATIONAL NON-U.S. FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT

THE END OF EACH PERIOD. REVENUES AND EXPENSES FOR THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED USING RATES THAT APPROXIMATE THOSE IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSLATIONS ARE

CREDITED OR CHARGED TO "ACCUMULATED TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT" INCLUDED IN "ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS)" IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN MANUFACTURING SUBSIDIARIES AND

CERTAIN OTHER INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES THAT USE THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, REMEASURE MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE

55

RATES, AND INVENTORIES, PROPERTY, AND NONMONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT HISTORICAL RATES. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSLATIONS ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF PRODUCTS (HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND PERIPHERALS), CONSULTING AND IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES, AND EXTENDED WARRANTY AND

SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, INCLUDING STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) NO. 97-2,

SOFTWARE

REVENUE RECOGNITION

, AS AMENDED. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND

COLLECTIBILITY IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED, AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES

TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE UNITED STATES, AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL PRODUCT IS RECEIVED BY THE CUSTOMER BECAUSE THE COMPANY LEGALLY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK

OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. FOR OTHER PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET BY THE COMPANY AT THE TIME PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. THE COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED

COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING RESELLER AND END USER REBATES AND OTHER SALES PROGRAMS AND VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES.

REVENUE

FOR CONSULTING AND IMPLEMENTATION SERVICES IS RECOGNIZED UPON PERFORMANCE AND ACCEPTANCE BY THE CUSTOMER. REVENUE FROM EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE

CONTRACT PERIOD. AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS IN EXCESS OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED ON EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS DEFERRED REVENUE UNTIL REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA ARE MET.

REVENUE

ON ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS SUCH AS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES IS ALLOCATED TO EACH ELEMENT BASED ON VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH

ELEMENT. ALLOCATED REVENUE FOR EACH ELEMENT IS RECOGNIZED WHEN REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET FOR EACH ELEMENT. VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED

BASED ON THE PRICE CHARGED WHEN EACH ELEMENT IS SOLD SEPARATELY.

SHIPPING COSTS

THE COMPANY'S SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

WARRANTY EXPENSE

THE COMPANY PROVIDES CURRENTLY FOR THE ESTIMATED COST THAT MAY BE INCURRED UNDER PRODUCT WARRANTIES AT THE TIME RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED OR OTHERWISE MARKETED ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITALIZATION BEGINNING

WHEN A PRODUCT'S TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ENDING WHEN A PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. IN MOST INSTANCES, THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED SOON

AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. THEREFORE, COSTS INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY ARE USUALLY NOT SIGNIFICANT, AND GENERALLY ALL SOFTWARE

DEVELOPMENT COSTS HAVE BEEN EXPENSED.

DURING

THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X VERSION 10.2 (CODE-NAMED "JAGUAR") SUBSEQUENT TO

ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY AS EVIDENCED BY PUBLIC DEMONSTRATION AND RELEASE OF A DEVELOPER BETA IN MAY 2002 AND PRIOR TO RELEASE OF THE FINAL VERSION OF THE PRODUCT IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED APPROXIMATELY $13.3 MILLION OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPMENT OF

56

JAGUAR. AMORTIZATION OF THIS ASSET BEGAN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER WHEN JAGUAR WAS SHIPPED AND IS BEING RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 3 YEARS. IN ADDITION, DURING 2002, THE

COMPANY ALSO BEGAN CAPITALIZING CERTAIN COSTS RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT OF ITS NEW POWERSCHOOL ENTERPRISE STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM. CAPITALIZATION, WHICH BEGAN UPON ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL

FEASIBILITY IN THE FIRST QUARTER, AMOUNTED TO APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION DURING THE FIRST NINE MONTHS OF FISCAL 2002. THE FINAL VERSION OF THE ENTERPRISE STUDENT INFORMATION SYSTEM WAS RELEASED

IN JULY.

DURING

2001 THE COMPANY INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF MAC OS X, SUBSEQUENT TO RELEASE OF A PUBLIC BETA VERSION OF THE PRODUCT AND

PRIOR TO RELEASE OF THE FINAL PRODUCT VERSION. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED APPROXIMATELY $5.4 MILLION OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS DURING 2001 ASSOCIATED WITH DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X. RELATED

AMORTIZATION IS COMPUTED BY USE OF THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET OF 8 YEARS.

TOTAL

AMORTIZATION RELATED TO CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS WAS $1.2 MILLION AND $350,000 IN 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

ADVERTISING COSTS

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $209 MILLION, $261 MILLION, AND $281 MILLION FOR 2002, 2001, AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY MEASURES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD PRESCRIBED BY ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD (APB)

OPINION 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

AND HAS PROVIDED PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES OF THE EFFECT ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE AS IF THE

FAIR VALUE-BASED METHOD HAD BEEN APPLIED IN MEASURING COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO FOLLOW APB NO. 25 BECAUSE, AS DISCUSSED BELOW, THE ALTERNATIVE FAIR VALUE ACCOUNTING

PROVIDED FOR UNDER SFAS NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

, REQUIRES USE OF OPTION VALUATION MODELS THAT WERE NOT DEVELOPED FOR USE

IN VALUING EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN SHARES. UNDER APB OPINION NO. 25, WHEN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS EQUALS THE MARKET PRICE OF

THE UNDERLYING STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED.

PRO

FORMA INFORMATION REGARDING NET INCOME (LOSS) PER SHARE IS REQUIRED BY SFAS NO. 123 AND HAS BEEN DETERMINED AS IF THE COMPANY HAD ACCOUNTED FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED AND

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN PURCHASES SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 29, 1995, UNDER THE FAIR VALUE METHOD OF THAT STATEMENT. THE FAIR VALUES FOR THESE OPTIONS AND STOCK PURCHASES WERE ESTIMATED AT

THE DATE OF GRANT AND BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY, USING A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. FOR PURPOSES OF PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES, THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTIONS AND SHARES ARE

AMORTIZED TO PRO FORMA NET INCOME OVER THE OPTIONS' VESTING PERIOD AND THE SHARES' PLAN PERIOD.

THE

BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION VALUATION MODEL WAS DEVELOPED FOR USE IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADED OPTIONS THAT HAVE NO VESTING RESTRICTIONS AND ARE FULLY TRANSFERABLE. IN ADDITION, OPTION

VALUATION MODELS REQUIRE THE INPUT OF HIGHLY SUBJECTIVE ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING THE EXPECTED LIFE OF OPTIONS AND THE COMPANY'S EXPECTED STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN SHARES HAVE CHARACTERISTICS SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THOSE OF TRADED OPTIONS, AND BECAUSE CHANGES IN THE SUBJECTIVE INPUT ASSUMPTIONS CAN MATERIALLY AFFECT

THE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATE, IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, THE EXISTING MODELS DO NOT PROVIDE A RELIABLE MEASURE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

SHARES.

57

FOR

PURPOSES OF THE PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 123 PROVIDED IN THE COMPANY'S ANNUAL REPORTS THROUGH 2002, THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTIONS USED BY THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN BASED

SOLELY ON HISTORICAL VOLATILITY RATES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. THE COMPANY HAS MADE NO ADJUSTMENTS TO ITS EXPECTED VOLATILITY ASSUMPTIONS BASED ON CURRENT MARKET CONDITIONS, CURRENT MARKET

TRENDS, OR EXPECTED VOLATILITY IMPLICIT IN MARKET TRADED OPTIONS ON THE COMPANY'S STOCK. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE PROPRIETY OF THIS APPROACH TO DEVELOPING ITS EXPECTED VOLATILITY

ASSUMPTION AND COULD DETERMINE FOR FUTURE PERIODS THAT ADJUSTMENTS TO HISTORICAL VOLATILITY AND/OR USE OF A METHODOLOGY THAT IS BASED ON THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY IMPLICIT IN MARKET TRADED OPTIONS ON

THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ARE MORE APPROPRIATE BASED ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IN FUTURE PERIODS.

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE

PERIOD. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD

INCREASED TO INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IF THE DILUTIVE POTENTIAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HAD BEEN ISSUED. THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF

OUTSTANDING OPTIONS IS REFLECTED IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY APPLICATION OF THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES IS REFLECTED USING THE

IF-CONVERTED METHOD. DILUTIVE POTENTIAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK RELATED TO STOCK OPTIONS WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED LOSS PER COMMON SHARE FOR FISCAL 2001 BECAUSE THEIR

EFFECT WOULD HAVE BEEN ANTIDILUTIVE.

STOCK SPLIT

ON JUNE 21, 2000, THE COMPANY AFFECTED A TWO-FOR-ONE STOCK SPLIT IN THE FORM OF A COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND TO SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD AS OF

MAY 19, 2000. ALL PER SHARE DATA AND NUMBERS OF COMMON SHARES HAVE BEEN RETROACTIVELY ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE STOCK SPLIT.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS, NET INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME REFERS TO REVENUE, EXPENSES, GAINS AND LOSSES THAT UNDER

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ARE RECORDED AS AN ELEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY BUT ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET INCOME. THE COMPANY'S OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS COMPRISED OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES NOT USING THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, FROM UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES CATEGORIZED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, AND FROM NET DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES ON CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

THE COMPANY REPORTS SEGMENT INFORMATION BASED ON THE "MANAGEMENT" APPROACH. THE MANAGEMENT APPROACH DESIGNATES THE INTERNAL REPORTING USED BY MANAGEMENT FOR MAKING DECISIONS

AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE AS THE SOURCE OF THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS. INFORMATION ABOUT THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, MAJOR CUSTOMERS, AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS ON A COMPANY-WIDE BASIS IS

ALSO DISCLOSED.

COMMERCIAL PAPER, LOAN PARTICIPATION, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND TIME DEPOSITS WITH FOREIGN INSTITUTIONS, MOST OF WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. NET UNREALIZED GAINS ON THE COMPANY'S

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INVESTMENTS WITH STATED MATURITIES GREATER THAN 1 YEAR, WERE $20 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002 AND $11 MILLION AS OF

SEPTEMBER 29, 2001. THE COMPANY OCCASIONALLY SELLS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO THEIR STATED MATURITIES. AS A RESULT OF SUCH SALES, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET GAINS OF

$7 MILLION IN 2002 AND $1 MILLION IN 2001. THESE NET GAINS WERE INCLUDED IN INTEREST AND OTHER INCOME, NET.

AS

OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, APPROXIMATELY $1.087 BILLION OF THE COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES OF BETWEEN 1 AND 5 YEARS. THE REMAINING

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002 ALL HAD MATURITIES OF BETWEEN 3 AND 12 MONTHS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2001, APPROXIMATELY $313 MILLION OF THE

COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN U.S. AGENCY SECURITIES HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES OF BETWEEN 1 AND 4 YEARS. THE REMAINING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AS OF

SEPTEMBER 29, 2001, ALL HAD MATURITIES OF BETWEEN 3 AND 12 MONTHS.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER RESELLERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATION AND CONSUMER CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE

COLLATERAL FROM ITS CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER, WHEN POSSIBLE THE COMPANY DOES ATTEMPT TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK ON TRADE RECEIVABLES THROUGH THE USE OF FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS FOR SELECTED CUSTOMERS WITH

THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES AND CREDIT INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN LATIN AMERICA AND ASIA. HOWEVER, CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL OR CREDIT INSURANCE ARE

OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS. TRADE RECEIVABLES FROM A SINGLE CUSTOMER, INGRAM MICRO, INC., ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 10.8% AND 9.4% OF NET ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY HAS NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF ITS MANUFACTURING VENDORS RESULTING FROM THE SALE BY THE COMPANY OF RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS TO THESE

MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY PURCHASES THESE RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS DIRECTLY FROM SUPPLIERS. THESE

NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCES SHEETS IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, TOTALED $142 MILLION AND $68 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002,

AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2001, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY PROFITS ON THESE SALES OR REFLECT THE SALE OF THESE COMPONENTS IN ITS NET SALES.

INVENTORY PREPAYMENT

IN APRIL 2002, THE COMPANY MADE A $100 MILLION PREPAYMENT TO AN ASIAN SUPPLIER FOR THE PURCHASE OF COMPONENTS OVER THE FOLLOWING NINE MONTHS. IN RETURN FOR THIS

DEPOSIT, THE SUPPLIER AGREED TO SUPPLY THE COMPANY WITH A SPECIFIED LEVEL OF COMPONENTS IN THE THREE CONSECUTIVE FISCAL QUARTERS ENDING DECEMBER 28, 2002. IF THE SUPPLIER FAILS TO SUPPLY THE

AGREED UPON LEVEL OF COMPONENTS IN ANY OF THOSE THREE FISCAL QUARTERS, THE COMPANY MAY CANCEL THE ARRANGEMENT AND RECEIVE THE AMOUNT OF THE PREPAYMENT NOT UTILIZED PLUS A PENALTY. APPROXIMATELY

$53 MILLION OF THIS DEPOSIT REMAINED UNUSED AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, AND IS REFLECTED IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS. THE AMOUNT OF THE PREPAYMENT

NOT UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 31, 2002, IS REFUNDABLE TO THE COMPANY BY JANUARY 31, 2003.

ALTHOUGH

THE SUPPLIER'S EXISTING DEBT IS UNRATED, ITS PUBLIC DEBT PRICING IS CONSISTENT WITH OTHER BBB RATED COMPANIES. THE DEPOSIT IS UNSECURED AND HAS NO STATED INTEREST COMPONENT. THE COMPANY IS

IMPUTING AN AMOUNT TO COST OF SALES AND INTEREST INCOME DURING EACH PERIOD THE DEPOSIT IS OUTSTANDING AT AN APPROPRIATE MARKET INTEREST RATE TO REFLECT THE ECONOMICS OF THIS TRANSACTION. IN LIGHT OF

THE SUPPLIER'S IMPLIED DEBT RATING AND BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S PREPAYMENT IS UNSECURED, NON-PERFORMANCE BY AND/OR ECONOMIC DETERIORATION OF THE SUPPLIER COULD PLACE ALL OR SOME OF THE

COMPANY'S DEPOSIT AT RISK.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES TO PARTIALLY OFFSET ITS BUSINESS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATE RISK. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE USED TO

OFFSET THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ON CERTAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND TO HEDGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON CERTAIN FORECASTED REVENUES AND COST OF SALES. FROM

TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO MODIFY THE INTEREST RATE PROFILE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND DEBT. THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE

BASED ON WHETHER THE INSTRUMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGE OR NON-HEDGE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS ALL DERIVATIVES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE.

THE

NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE ONE MEASURE OF THE TRANSACTION VOLUME OUTSTANDING AS OF YEAR-END, AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY'S

EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR MARKET LOSS. THE CREDIT RISK AMOUNT SHOWN IN THE TABLE ABOVE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S GROSS EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING LOSS ON THESE TRANSACTIONS IF ALL COUNTERPARTIES

FAILED TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, BASED ON THEN-CURRENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE AND INTEREST RATES AT EACH RESPECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS AND

MARKET RISK WILL VARY OVER TIME AS A FUNCTION OF INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE

ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE BASED ON APPLICABLE AND COMMONLY USED PRICING MODELS USING PREVAILING FINANCIAL MARKET INFORMATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2001. IN

CERTAIN INSTANCES WHERE JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ESTIMATING FAIR VALUE, PRICE QUOTES WERE OBTAINED FROM SEVERAL OF THE COMPANY'S COUNTERPARTY FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE TABLE ABOVE REFLECTS

THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL,

FAIR VALUE, AND CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANY'S INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS, IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPOSURES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT THE

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE. THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TOGETHER WITH THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE

UNDERLYING EXPOSURES, WILL DEPEND ON ACTUAL MARKET CONDITIONS DURING THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENTS.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRIMARILY TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS AND CERTAIN PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY'S PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY OF ITS EXISTING

MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY NOT HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE TRANSACTION EXPOSURES DUE TO IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR

EXPOSURES, OR AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

61

IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 133, HEDGES RELATED TO PROBABLE BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS OF AN ANTICIPATORY NATURE ARE DESIGNATED AND DOCUMENTED AT HEDGE INCEPTION AS CASH FLOW HEDGES

AND EVALUATED FOR HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS QUARTERLY. FOR CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE

FORWARD EXCHANGE RATE. CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON THE FORECASTED HEDGED TRANSACTION AND CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD HEDGE ARE BOTH MEASURED FROM THE CONTRACT RATE TO THE

FORWARD EXCHANGE RATE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FORWARD CONTRACT'S MATURITY DATE.

FOR

CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS, HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS MEASURED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTION CONTRACT. HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS IS ASSESSED BY COMPARING THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE

CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON THE HEDGED TRANSACTION DETERMINED AS THE SUM OF THE PROBABILITY-WEIGHTED OUTCOMES WITH RESPECT TO THE OPTION STRIKE RATES WITH THE TOTAL CHANGE IN

FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTION HEDGE. THE NET GAINS OR LOSSES ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS QUALIFYING AS CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE REPORTED AS COMPONENTS OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND

RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. ANY RESIDUAL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT

EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

TO

PROTECT GROSS MARGINS FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, THE COMPANY'S U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL SUBSIDIARIES HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES, AND THE

COMPANY'S NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL SUBSIDIARIES SELLING IN LOCAL CURRENCIES HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INVENTORY PURCHASES NOT DENOMINATED IN THE SUBSIDIARIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES IS RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED SALES ARE RECOGNIZED, AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME RELATED TO INVENTORY PURCHASES IS RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF COST OF SALES IN

THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED. TYPICALLY, THE COMPANY HEDGES PORTIONS OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUES AND INVENTORY PURCHASES OVER A TIME

HORIZON OF 3 TO 9 MONTHS.

THE

COMPANY ALSO ENTERS INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN RECORDED ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AS OFFSETS TO THE CHANGES IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES.

THE

COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE TRANSLATION AND ECONOMIC EXPOSURE OF A NET INVESTMENT POSITION IN A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY. HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS ON FORWARDS

DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES IS MEASURED BASED ON CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTRACT ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN THE SPOT EXCHANGE RATE. THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON A

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DESIGNATED AS A HEDGE OF THE NET INVESTMENT POSITION IN A FOREIGN SUBSIDIARY IS REPORTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS A FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. ANY RESIDUAL CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE OF THE FORWARD CONTRACT, INCLUDING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE DIFFERENTIAL BETWEEN THE SPOT AND FORWARD EXCHANGE RATES ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND

EXPENSE.

AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS AS ITEMS THAT PROVIDE AN OFFSET TO THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN RECORDED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DENOMINATED

IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. ALL CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS BASED ON CHANGES IN OPTION TIME VALUE ARE RECORDED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND

EXPENSE. DUE TO MARKET MOVEMENTS, CHANGES IN OPTION TIME VALUE CAN LEAD TO INCREASED VOLATILITY IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE DE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE FORECASTED HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED

TIME PERIOD OR WITHIN A

62

SUBSEQUENT 2 MONTH TIME PERIOD. DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE IMMEDIATELY RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME

AND EXPENSE. ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO REFLECTED IN CURRENT EARNINGS UNLESS THEY ARE RE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF OTHER TRANSACTIONS.

DURING 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED NET GAINS OF $2.5 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE RELATED TO THE LOSS OF HEDGE DESIGNATION ON DISCONTINUED CASH FLOW HEDGES DUE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S

FORECAST OF FUTURE NET SALES AND COST OF SALES AND DUE TO PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS. DURING 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET GAIN OF $5.1 MILLION IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE RELATED TO THE

LOSS OF HEDGE DESIGNATION ON DISCONTINUED CASH FLOW HEDGES DUE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S FORECAST OF FUTURE NET SALES AND COST OF SALES.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY SOMETIMES ENTERS INTO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS, COLLARS, AND FLOORS, WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER

MATCH THE COMPANY'S FLOATING-RATE INTEREST INCOME ON ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH ITS FIXED-RATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON ITS

LONG-TERM DEBT, AND/OR TO DIVERSIFY A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE AWAY FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN SHORT-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE

CONTRACTS THAT ARE INTENDED TO REDUCE THE COST OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR TRANSACT IN SUCH FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR PURPOSES OTHER THAN RISK

MANAGEMENT.

AS

OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, THE COMPANY HAD ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER MATCH THE COMPANY'S FLOATING-RATE INTEREST INCOME ON ITS

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH ITS FIXED-RATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON ITS LONG-TERM DEBT, AND TO DIVERSIFY A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE AWAY

FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN SHORT-TERM U.S. INTEREST RATES. THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS GENERALLY REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO PAY A FLOATING INTEREST RATE BASED ON THE THREE- OR SIX-MONTH

U.S. DOLLAR LIBOR AND RECEIVE A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST WITHOUT EXCHANGES OF THE UNDERLYING NOTIONAL AMOUNTS. THESE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED THE COMPANY'S FIXED-RATE 10-YEAR

DEBT TO FLOATING-RATE DEBT AND CONVERTED A PORTION OF THE FLOATING RATE INVESTMENTS TO FIXED RATE. THE COMPANY ASSUMED NO INEFFECTIVENESS WITH REGARD TO THE DEBT INTEREST SWAPS AS EACH

DEBT INTEREST RATE SWAP MET THE CRITERIA FOR ACCOUNTING UNDER THE SHORT-CUT METHOD DEFINED IN SFAS NO. 133 FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, NO NET GAINS OR

LOSSES WERE RECORDED IN INCOME RELATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S UNDERLYING DEBT INTEREST RATE SWAPS. DURING FISCAL 2001, THE COMPANY CLOSED OUT ALL OF ITS EXISTING DEBT INTEREST RATE SWAP POSITIONS DUE TO

PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES REALIZING A GAIN OF $17 MILLION. THIS GAIN WAS DEFERRED, RECOGNIZED IN LONG-TERM DEBT AND IS BEING AMORTIZED TO OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE OVER THE

REMAINING LIFE OF THE DEBT.

THE

UNREALIZED LOSS ON THE ASSETS SWAPS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, OF $5.7 MILLION WAS DEFERRED AND THEN RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN 2001 AS PART OF THE SFAS NO. 133 TRANSITION

ADJUSTMENT EFFECTIVE ON OCTOBER 1, 2000. THE COMPANY CLOSED OUT ALL OF ITS EXISTING INTEREST RATE ASSET SWAPS DURING 2001 REALIZING A GAIN OF $1.1 MILLION.

AS

OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD NO INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES OUTSTANDING. DUE TO PERCEIVED MARKET RISK, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS IN EARLY 2002. THESE INTEREST RATE

SWAPS WERE ENTERED INTO WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO BETTER MATCH THE COMPANY'S FLOATING-RATE INTEREST INCOME ON ITS CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WITH

ITS FIXED-RATE INTEREST EXPENSE ON ITS LONG-TERM DEBT. THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO PAY A FLOATING INTEREST RATE BASED ON SIX-MONTH U.S. DOLLAR

LIBOR AND RECEIVE A FIXED RATE OF INTEREST WITHOUT EXCHANGES OF THE UNDERLYING NOTIONAL AMOUNTS. THESE SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERTED THE COMPANY'S FIXED-RATE 10-YEAR DEBT TO

FLOATING-RATE DEBT. THE COMPANY ASSUMED NO INEFFECTIVENESS WITH REGARD TO THE DEBT INTEREST SWAPS AS EACH DEBT INTEREST RATE SWAP MET THE CRITERIA FOR ACCOUNTING UNDER THE

SHORT-CUT METHOD DEFINED IN SFAS NO. 133 FOR FAIR

63

VALUE HEDGES OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, NO NET GAINS OR LOSSES WERE RECORDED IN INCOME RELATIVE TO THE COMPANY'S UNDERLYING DEBT INTEREST RATE SWAPS DURING FISCAL 2002 UNTIL THE COMPANY CLOSED

OUT THE POSITIONS IN LATE 2002 DUE TO PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES. CLOSING THE DEBT INTEREST RATE SWAPS RESULTED IN A REALIZED GAIN OF $6 MILLION. THIS GAIN WAS DEFERRED, RECOGNIZED IN

LONG-TERM DEBT AND IS BEING AMORTIZED TO OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE DEBT.

LONG-TERM DEBT

DURING 1994, THE COMPANY ISSUED $300 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 6.5% UNSECURED NOTES IN A PUBLIC OFFERING REGISTERED WITH THE SEC. THE NOTES WERE SOLD AT

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE NOTES, INCLUDING UNAMORTIZED DEFERRED GAINS ASSOCIATED WITH CLOSED DEBT INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WAS $316 MILLION AND $317 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THE FAIR

VALUE WAS $299 MILLION AND $295 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE NOTES IS BASED ON THEIR LISTED MARKET VALUES AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2001.

IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001, AN ADJUSTMENT WAS MADE TO INCREASE GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF POWERSCHOOL BY $5.9 MILLION DUE TO THE IDENTIFICATION OF PREVIOUSLY UNIDENTIFIED

LOSS CONTINGENCIES THAT WERE IN EXISTENCE PRIOR TO CONSUMMATION OF THE ACQUISITION.

ACQUISITION-RELATED DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION

2000 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2000, THE COMPANY INITIATED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS RESULTING IN RECOGNITION OF AN $8 MILLION RESTRUCTURING CHARGE. THIS CHARGE WAS COMPRISED

OF $3 MILLION FOR THE WRITE-OFF OF VARIOUS OPERATING ASSETS AND $5 MILLION FOR SEVERANCE PAYMENTS TO APPROXIMATELY 95 EMPLOYEES ASSOCIATED WITH CONSOLIDATION OF VARIOUS

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL SALES AND MARKETING FUNCTIONS. OF THE $5 MILLION ACCRUED FOR SEVERANCE, $2.5 MILLION HAD BEEN SPENT BEFORE THE END OF 2000, AND THE REMAINDER WAS SPENT IN

AN AIRCRAFT WITH A TOTAL COST TO THE COMPANY OF APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WAS NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE. APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE TOTAL CHARGE IS FOR THE COST OF THE AIRCRAFT.

THE OTHER HALF REPRESENTS ALL OTHER COSTS AND TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH THE BONUS. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, ALL SIGNIFICANT WORK AND PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AIRCRAFT WERE COMPLETE. OF THE

ORIGINAL $90 MILLION ACCRUAL, $2.4 MILLION REMAINED UNSPENT AT THE END OF FISCAL 2002 AND WAS REVERSED.

TECHNOLOGY ACQUISITION

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4, DURING BOTH 2002 AND 2001 IN ITS ACQUISITION OF EMAGIC AND POWERSCHOOL, RESPECTIVELY, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED CERTAIN TECHNOLOGY THAT WAS UNDER

DEVELOPMENT AND HAD NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USE. THIS RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF $551,000 FOR EMAGIC AND

THE

FOREIGN PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON FOREIGN PRETAX EARNINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $284 MILLION, $363 MILLION AND $1.019 BILLION IN 2002, 2001, AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. AS

OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, APPROXIMATELY HALF OF THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND IS GENERALLY BASED IN U.S.

DOLLAR-DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. AMOUNTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WOULD BE SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXATION ON REPATRIATION TO THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FULLY

PROVIDE FOR ANY RELATED TAX LIABILITY ON AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE REPATRIATED, ASIDE FROM UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED IN OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF $755 MILLION OF SUCH EARNINGS. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE

INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT MIGHT BE INCURRED IF THESE EARNINGS WERE TO BE DISTRIBUTED.

DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF TAX LOSSES, CREDITS, AND THE FUTURE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS

OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES AND ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED

TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED.

OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS FOR FEDERAL TAX PURPOSES OF APPROXIMATELY $72 MILLION, WHICH EXPIRE FROM 2009 THROUGH 2021. THESE CARRYFORWARDS ARE

COMPRISED OF REMAINING OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS ACQUIRED FROM NEXT AND OTHER ACQUISITIONS, THE UTILIZATION OF WHICH IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN LIMITATIONS IMPOSED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THE

COMPANY ALSO HAS FEDERAL CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS AND VARIOUS STATE AND FOREIGN TAX LOSS AND CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS, THE TAX EFFECT OF WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY $94 MILLION AND WHICH EXPIRE BETWEEN 2003

AND 2022. THE REMAINING BENEFITS

FROM TAX LOSSES AND CREDITS DO NOT EXPIRE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $30 MILLION WAS RECORDED AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR THE BENEFITS OF TAX LOSSES THAT

MAY NOT BE REALIZED. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE OPERATING LOSS CARRYFORWARDS ACQUIRED FROM NEXT AND OTHER ACQUISITIONS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT

FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY

RECOVER THE REMAINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS.

CONCENTRATIONS IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCT

ALTHOUGH CERTAIN COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, OTHER KEY COMPONENTS (INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND

APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS, OR ("ASICS")) ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME OTHER KEY COMPONENTS, WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM

MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER

INDUSTRY, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR AND

SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT TO THE COMPANY WERE TO BE DELAYED OR CURTAILED OR IN THE EVENT A KEY MANUFACTURING

80

VENDOR DELAYS SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SHIP RELATED PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANY'S

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF

COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. FINALLY, SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE COMPANY'S CPUS, LOGIC BOARDS, AND ASSEMBLED PRODUCTS ARE NOW MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, THE

MAJORITY OF WHICH OCCURS IN VARIOUS PARTS OF ASIA. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WORKS CLOSELY WITH ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ON MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES AND LEVELS, THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS WERE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION OBLIGATIONS.

CONTINGENCIES

BEGINNING ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2001, THREE SHAREHOLDER CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA AGAINST

THE COMPANY AND ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. THESE LAWSUITS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL, AND PURPORT TO BRING SUIT ON BEHALF OF PERSONS WHO PURCHASED THE COMPANY'S PUBLICLY TRADED COMMON STOCK BETWEEN

JULY 19, 2000, AND SEPTEMBER 28, 2000. THE COMPLAINTS ALLEGE VIOLATIONS OF THE 1934 SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT AND SEEK UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND OTHER RELIEF. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THESE CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND INTENDS TO DEFEND THEM VIGOROUSLY. THE COMPANY FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS ON JUNE 4, 2002, WHICH WAS HEARD BY THE COURT ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2002.

ON DECEMBER 11, 2002, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANY'S MOTION TO DISMISS FOR FAILURE TO STATE A CAUSE OF ACTION, WITH LEAVE TO PLAINTIFFS TO AMEND THEIR COMPLAINT WITHIN THIRTY DAYS.

THE

COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY ADJUDICATED. IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY

DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS BE RESOLVED

AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE

PARLIAMENT OF THE EUROPEAN UNION IS WORKING ON FINALIZING THE WASTE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONIC EQUIPMENT DIRECTIVE (THE DIRECTIVE). THE DIRECTIVE MAKES PRODUCERS OF ELECTRICAL GOODS, INCLUDING

PERSONAL COMPUTERS, FINANCIALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE COLLECTION, RECYCLING, AND SAFE DISPOSAL OF PAST AND FUTURE PRODUCTS. THE DIRECTIVE MUST NOW BE APPROVED AND IMPLEMENTED BY INDIVIDUAL EUROPEAN

UNION GOVERNMENTS BY JUNE 2004, WHILE THE PRODUCERS' FINANCIAL OBLIGATIONS ARE SCHEDULED TO START JUNE 2005. THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY RESULTING FROM THE DIRECTIVE RELATED TO

PAST SALES OF ITS PRODUCTS AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH FUTURE SALES OF ITS PRODUCT MAY BE SUBSTANTIAL. HOWEVER, BECAUSE IT IS LIKELY THAT SPECIFIC LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND ENFORCEMENT POLICIES WILL

VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN INDIVIDUAL EUROPEAN MEMBER STATES, IT IS NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE COMPANY'S EXISTING LIABILITY OR FUTURE EXPENSES RESULTING FROM THE DIRECTIVE. AS THE EUROPEAN

UNION AND ITS INDIVIDUAL MEMBER STATES CLARIFY SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS AND POLICIES WITH RESPECT TO THE DIRECTIVE, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS ITS POTENTIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT. SIMILAR LEGISLATION

MAY BE ENACTED IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIES, INCLUDING FEDERAL AND STATE LEGISLATION IN THE UNITED STATES, THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF WHICH COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE COMPRISED OF THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND RETAIL. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCLUDES BOTH NORTH

AND SOUTH AMERICA, EXCEPT FOR THE ACTIVITIES OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT. THE EUROPE SEGMENT INCLUDES EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. THE JAPAN SEGMENT INCLUDES ONLY

JAPAN. THE RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATES APPLE-OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE UNITED STATES. OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS INCLUDE ASIA-PACIFIC, WHICH INCLUDES AUSTRALIA AND ASIA EXCEPT FOR JAPAN, AND

THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARY, FILEMAKER, INC. EACH REPORTABLE GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT PROVIDES SIMILAR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE VARIOUS SEGMENTS ARE THE SAME

AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN THE SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN NOTE 1, EXCEPT AS DESCRIBED BELOW FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT.

THE

COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON NET SALES AND OPERATING INCOME. NET SALES FOR GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS ARE BASED ON THE LOCATION OF THE CUSTOMERS. OPERATING INCOME

FOR EACH SEGMENT INCLUDES REVENUE FROM THIRD-PARTIES, COST OF SALES, AND OPERATING EXPENSES DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SEGMENT. OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT EXCLUDES OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE

AND CERTAIN EXPENSES THAT ARE MANAGED OUTSIDE THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. COSTS EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE VARIOUS CORPORATE EXPENSES, MANUFACTURING COSTS NOT INCLUDED IN STANDARD

COSTS, INCOME TAXES, AND VARIOUS NONRECURRING CHARGES. CORPORATE EXPENSES INCLUDE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CORPORATE MARKETING EXPENSES, AND OTHER SEPARATELY MANAGED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES INCLUDING CERTAIN CORPORATE EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SUPPORT OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT. THE COMPANY DOES NOT INCLUDE INTERCOMPANY TRANSFERS BETWEEN SEGMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES.

GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND RETAIL STORE CONSTRUCTION-IN-PROGRESS WHICH IS NOT SUBJECT TO DEPRECIATION. EXCEPT FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT, CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE NOT REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT BY SEGMENT. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT WERE $106 MILLION IN 2002 AND $92 MILLION IN 2001.

OPERATING

INCOME FOR ALL SEGMENTS EXCEPT RETAIL INCLUDES COST OF SALES AT STANDARD COST. CERTAIN MANUFACTURING EXPENSES AND RELATED ADJUSTMENTS NOT INCLUDED IN SEGMENT COST OF SALES, INCLUDING

VARIANCES BETWEEN STANDARD AND ACTUAL MANUFACTURING COSTS AND THE MARK-UP ABOVE STANDARD COST FOR PRODUCT SUPPLIED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT, ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE EXPENSES.

TO

ASSESS THE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT SEVERAL SIGNIFICANT ITEMS ARE INCLUDED IN ITS RESULTS FOR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING THAT ARE NOT INCLUDED IN RESULTS OF THE COMPANY'S

OTHER SEGMENTS. FIRST, COST OF SALES FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT INCLUDES A MARK-UP ABOVE THE COMPANY'S STANDARD COST TO APPROXIMATE THE PRICE NORMALLY CHARGED TO THE COMPANY'S MAJOR CHANNEL

PARTNERS IN THE UNITED STATES. FOR THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2002 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2001, THIS RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF ADDITIONAL COST OF SALES ABOVE STANDARD

COST BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT AND AN OFFSETTING BENEFIT TO CORPORATE EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $52 MILLION AND $4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. SECOND, THE RETAIL SEGMENT INCLUDES IN ITS NET SALES

PROCEEDS FROM SALES OF THE COMPANY'S EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. THIS TREATMENT IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE COMPANY'S MAJOR CHANNEL PARTNERS ACCOUNT FOR THE SALE OF THE COMPANY'S EXTENDED

WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. BECAUSE THE REVENUE FROM THESE CONTRACTS HAS YET TO BE EARNED BY THE COMPANY, AN OFFSET TO THIS AMOUNT IS REFLECTED AS A DECREASE IN OTHER SEGMENTS' NET SALES. FOR THE

TWELVE-MONTH PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, THIS RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF ADDITIONAL NET SALES BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT, AND AN OFFSETTING REDUCTION TO OTHER SEGMENTS' NET SALES OF

$4.8 MILLION. THIS AMOUNT WAS INSIGNIFICANT IN 2001. THIRD, A PORTION OF THE OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN HIGH PROFILE RETAIL STORES ARE ALLOCATED FROM THE RETAIL SEGMENT TO

CORPORATE MARKETING EXPENSE. ALLOCATION OF THESE EXPENSES REFLECTS THE UNIQUE NATURE OF THESE STORES WHICH, GIVEN THEIR LARGER SIZE AND EXTRAORDINARY DESIGN ELEMENTS, FUNCTION AS VEHICLES FOR GENERAL

CORPORATE MARKETING, CORPORATE EVENTS, AND BRAND

82

AWARENESS. ALLOCATED OPERATING COSTS ARE THOSE IN EXCESS OF OPERATING COSTS INCURRED BY ONE OF THE COMPANY'S MORE TYPICAL RETAIL LOCATIONS. STORES WERE OPEN IN TWO SUCH HIGH PROFILE LOCATIONS IN NEW

YORK AND LOS ANGELES AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2002, BOTH OF WHICH WERE OPENED IN FISCAL 2002. EXPENSES ALLOCATED TO CORPORATE MARKETING RESULTING FROM THE OPERATIONS OF THESE TWO STORES WAS

$1 MILLION IN 2002.
