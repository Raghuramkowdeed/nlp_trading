PROTECTION

PLAN. THE APPLECARE PROTECTION PLAN IS A FEE-BASED SERVICE THAT TYPICALLY INCLUDES THREE YEARS OF PHONE SUPPORT AND HARDWARE REPAIRS, DEDICATED WEB-BASED SUPPORT

RESOURCES, AND USER DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS.

MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTION

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE EDUCATION, CREATIVE PROFESSIONAL, CONSUMER, AND BUSINESS MARKETS. THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS,

RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS AND CATALOGUERS. NO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF NET SALES IN 2007, 2006, OR 2005. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND

RESELLS CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO CONSUMERS, EDUCATION CUSTOMERS, AND BUSINESSES THROUGH ITS OWN SALES FORCE AND RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES.

COMPETITION

THE COMPANY IS CONFRONTED BY AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION IN ALL AREAS OF ITS BUSINESS. THE MARKETS FOR CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, PERSONAL COMPUTERS, RELATED SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERAL

PRODUCTS, DIGITAL MUSIC DEVICES AND RELATED SERVICES, AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. THESE MARKETS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN BOTH HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY INCREASED THE CAPABILITIES AND USE OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS, OTHER DIGITAL ELECTRONIC DEVICES, AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES THAT HAVE RESULTED IN THE FREQUENT

INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS WITH COMPETITIVE PRICE, FEATURE, AND PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS. OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, PRICE COMPETITION IN THESE MARKETS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE. THE

COMPANY'S COMPETITORS WHO SELL PERSONAL COMPUTERS BASED ON OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED THEIR PRODUCT MARGINS TO GAIN OR MAINTAIN MARKET SHARE. THE COMPANY'S

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE AND OTHER INDUSTRY-WIDE DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON GROSS MARGINS. THE PRINCIPAL COMPETITIVE FACTORS INCLUDE PRICE,

PRODUCT FEATURES, RELATIVE PRICE/PERFORMANCE, PRODUCT QUALITY AND RELIABILITY, DESIGN INNOVATION, AVAILABILITY OF SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERALS, MARKETING AND DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITY, SERVICE AND SUPPORT,

AND CORPORATE REPUTATION. FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS PLACE MORE RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT ARE SMALLER, SIMPLER, AND LESS

EXPENSIVE THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS.

THE

COMPANY'S MUSIC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES HAVE FACED SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM OTHER COMPANIES PROMOTING THEIR OWN DIGITAL MUSIC AND CONTENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING THOSE OFFERING FREE

PEER-TO-PEER MUSIC AND VIDEO SERVICES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT CURRENTLY RETAINS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE BY OFFERING SUPERIOR INNOVATION AND INTEGRATION OF THE ENTIRE SOLUTION

INCLUDING THE HARDWARE (PERSONAL COMPUTER AND IPOD), SOFTWARE (ITUNES), AND DISTRIBUTION OF CONTENT (ITUNES STORE AND ITUNES WI-FI MUSIC STORE). HOWEVER, THE COMPANY EXPECTS COMPETITION IN

THIS SPACE TO INTENSIFY AS COMPETITORS ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THE COMPANY'S APPROACH TO TIGHTLY INTEGRATING THESE ELEMENTS WITHIN THEIR OWN OFFERINGS OR, ALTERNATIVELY, COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER TO

OFFER SOLUTIONS THAT ARE MORE INTEGRATED THAN THOSE THEY CURRENTLY OFFER. SOME OF THESE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO PROFIT OR EVEN AT A LOSS TO COMPETE WITH THE COMPANY'S OFFERINGS.

THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON MARKET OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES INCLUDING THE IPHONE. THE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE WITH SEVERAL LARGE,

WELL-FUNDED, AND EXPERIENCED COMPETITORS. THE COMPANY FACES COMPETITION FROM MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICE COMPANIES THAT MAY ATTEMPT TO IMITATE SOME OF THE IPHONE'S FUNCTIONS AND

APPLICATIONS WITHIN THEIR OWN SMART PHONES. THIS INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE PRICING PRACTICES, FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, EVOLVING DESIGN APPROACHES AND TECHNOLOGIES, RAPID ADOPTION

OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT ADVANCEMENTS BY COMPETITORS, AND PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS.

THE

COMPANY'S FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MAC PLATFORM AND TO THE COMPANY'S

10

HARDWARE,

SOFTWARE AND SERVICES RELATED TO CONSUMER ELECTRONIC DEVICES, INCLUDING IPODS, AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES, INCLUDING IPHONE.

RAW MATERIALS

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

MICROPROCESSORS, ENCLOSURES, CERTAIN LCDS, CERTAIN OPTICAL DRIVES, AND APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ("ASICS") ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME KEY

COMPONENTS, WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE AVAILABILITY CONSTRAINTS AND PRICING PRESSURES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

USES SOME COMPONENTS UNCOMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE CUSTOM

COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY OR SINGLE-SOURCED

COMPONENT TO THE COMPANY WERE TO BE DELAYED OR CURTAILED OR IN THE EVENT A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYED SHIPMENT OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO SHIP RELATED

PRODUCTS IN DESIRED

QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF SUPPLIERS WERE TO DECIDE

TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO MITIGATE THESE POTENTIAL RISKS BY WORKING CLOSELY

WITH THESE AND OTHER KEY SUPPLIERS ON PRODUCT INTRODUCTION PLANS, STRATEGIC INVENTORIES, COORDINATED PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AND INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES AND LEVELS. CONSISTENT

WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF FORMAL PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. THE COMPANY'S

PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER ITS REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THERE ARE SEVERAL COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHOSE LOSS TO THE COMPANY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT UPON THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

AT THIS TIME, SUCH VENDORS INCLUDE AGERE SYSTEMS, INC., AMBIT MICROSYSTEMS CORPORATION, AMPEREX TECHNOLOGY LIMITED, ASUSTEK CORPORATION, ATI TECHNOLOGIES, INC., ATHEROS

COMMUNICATIONS INC., AU OPTRONICS CORPORATION, BROADCOM CORPORATION, CHI MEI OPTOELECTRONICS CORPORATION, CYPRESS SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION, HITACHI GLOBAL STORAGE TECHNOLOGIES, HON HAI

PRECISION INDUSTRY CO., LTD., INFINEON TECHNOLOGIES AG, INTEL CORPORATION, INVENTEC APPLIANCES CORPORATION, LG. PHILLIPS CO., LTD., MATSUSHITA, MURATA MANUFACTURING CO., LTD.,

NATIONAL SEMICONDUCTOR CORPORATION, NVIDIA CORP., INC., QUANTA COMPUTER, INC., RENESAS SEMICONDUCTOR CO. LTD., SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS, SONY CORPORATION, SYNAPTICS, INC., TEXAS

INSTRUMENTS, AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION. CERTAIN OF THESE VENDORS ARE THE SOLE-SOURCED SUPPLIER OF COMPONENTS AND MANUFACTURING OUTSOURCING FOR MANY OF THE COMPANY'S KEY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING

BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ASSEMBLY OF MOST OF THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE MAC COMPUTERS, IPODS, AND IPHONES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

BECAUSE THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES ARE CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO COMPETE

SUCCESSFULLY IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUAL AND TIMELY FLOW OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP NEW

PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES AND TO ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS IN THE AREAS OF COMPUTER HARDWARE AND PERIPHERALS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS PRODUCTS, MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES, SYSTEM SOFTWARE, APPLICATIONS

SOFTWARE, NETWORKING AND COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE AND SOLUTIONS, AND INTERNET SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS. THE COMPANY MAY EXPAND THE RANGE OF ITS PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THROUGH

LICENSING AND/OR ACQUISITION OF THIRD-PARTY BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY. THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES TOTALED $782 MILLION, $712 MILLION, AND $535 MILLION IN

2007, 2006, AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

11

PATENTS, TRADEMARKS, COPYRIGHTS AND LICENSES

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS RIGHTS TO PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS RELATING TO CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS COMPUTER SYSTEMS, IPODS, IPHONE, PERIPHERALS, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS REGISTERED, AND/OR HAS APPLIED TO REGISTER, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IN THE U.S. AND A NUMBER OF FOREIGN COUNTRIES FOR "APPLE," THE APPLE LOGO, "MACINTOSH," "MAC,"

"IPOD," "ITUNES," "ITUNES STORE," "IPHONE," AND NUMEROUS OTHER TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE OWNERSHIP OF SUCH PATENTS, COPYRIGHTS, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS IS AN

IMPORTANT FACTOR IN ITS BUSINESS AND THAT ITS SUCCESS DOES DEPEND IN PART ON THE OWNERSHIP THEREOF, THE COMPANY RELIES PRIMARILY ON THE INNOVATIVE SKILLS, TECHNICAL COMPETENCE, AND MARKETING ABILITIES

OF ITS PERSONNEL.

MANY

OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD-PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS

OF ITS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES, BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS; HOWEVER, THERE

IS NO GUARANTEE THAT SUCH LICENSES COULD BE OBTAINED AT ALL. BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY, CURRENT EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW

PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE EXISTING PATENTS OR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE

COMPANY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD-PARTIES.

FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

THE U.S. REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S LARGEST GEOGRAPHIC MARKETPLACE. APPROXIMATELY 60% OF THE COMPANY'S NET SALES IN 2007 CAME FROM SALES TO CUSTOMERS INSIDE THE U.S. FINAL

ASSEMBLY OF PRODUCTS SOLD BY THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED IN THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN CORK, IRELAND, AND BY EXTERNAL VENDORS IN FREMONT, CALIFORNIA; FULLERTON, CALIFORNIA; TAIWAN;

THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA ("KOREA"); THE PEOPLE'S REPUBLIC OF CHINA ("CHINA"); AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC. CURRENTLY, THE SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURE OF MANY CRITICAL COMPONENTS USED IN THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IS

PERFORMED BY SOLE-SOURCED THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN THE U.S., CHINA, JAPAN, KOREA, AND SINGAPORE. FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MACBOOK

PRO, MACBOOK, IPOD, AND IPHONE, IS PERFORMED BY SOLE-SOURCED THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN CHINA. MARGINS ON SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT

INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING

PENALTIES.

INFORMATION

REGARDING FINANCIAL DATA BY GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT IS SET FORTH IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AND IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AT

NOTE 9, "SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA."

SEASONAL BUSINESS

THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES IN ITS FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS COMPARED TO OTHER QUARTERS IN ITS FISCAL YEAR DUE TO SEASONAL DEMAND

RELATED TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. THIS HISTORICAL PATTERN SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY'S FUTURE NET SALES OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

WARRANTY

THE COMPANY OFFERS A BASIC LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY ON MOST OF ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MAC COMPUTERS, IPODS AND IPHONES. THE BASIC WARRANTY PERIOD IS TYPICALLY

ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE BY THE END-USER. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A 90-DAY BASIC WARRANTY FOR ITS SERVICE PARTS USED TO REPAIR THE COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, CONSUMERS MAY PURCHASE EXTENDED SERVICE COVERAGE ON MOST OF THE COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS IN ALL OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS.

12

BACKLOG

IN THE COMPANY'S EXPERIENCE, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF PRODUCT BACKLOG AT ANY PARTICULAR TIME IS NOT A MEANINGFUL INDICATION OF ITS FUTURE BUSINESS PROSPECTS. IN PARTICULAR, BACKLOG

OFTEN INCREASES IN ANTICIPATION OF OR IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AS DEALERS ANTICIPATE SHORTAGES. BACKLOG IS OFTEN REDUCED ONCE DEALERS AND CUSTOMERS BELIEVE THEY CAN OBTAIN

SUFFICIENT SUPPLY. BECAUSE OF THE FOREGOING, BACKLOG SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL OF REVENUE OR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

COMPLIANCE WITH FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL, AND FOREIGN LAWS ENACTED FOR THE PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT HAS TO DATE HAD NO MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

EARNINGS, OR COMPETITIVE POSITION. IN THE FUTURE, THESE LAWS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

PRODUCTION

AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS

THE ABILITY TO RETURN PRODUCT AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN

PASSED IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES INCLUDING VARIOUS COUNTRIES WITHIN EUROPE AND ASIA, CERTAIN CANADIAN PROVINCES AND CERTAIN STATES WITHIN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY

DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD APPROXIMATELY 21,600 FULL-TIME EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES AND AN ADDITIONAL 2,100 TEMPORARY EQUIVALENT EMPLOYEES AND

CONTRACTORS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE

CONSIDERED TO BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT USE HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE MATTERS RELATING TO THE COMPANY'S PAST STOCK OPTION PRACTICES AND THE RESTATEMENT OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND

GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

THE FINDINGS FROM THE COMPANY'S INVESTIGATION INTO ITS PAST STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES AND THE RESULTING RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ITS 2006

FORM 10-K HAVE EXPOSED THE COMPANY TO GREATER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. AS

13

DESCRIBED

IN PART I, ITEM 3, "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS," SEVERAL DERIVATIVE COMPLAINTS AND A CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT HAVE BEEN FILED IN STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN

CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS AND EXECUTIVE OFFICERS PERTAINING TO ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO PAST STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED THE RESULTS OF ITS INVESTIGATION TO THE SEC AND THE UNITED

STATES ATTORNEY'S OFFICE FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, AND THE COMPANY HAS RESPONDED TO THEIR REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE

ITS FULL COOPERATION.

ON

APRIL 24, 2007, THE SEC FILED AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION AGAINST TWO FORMER OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY. IN ANNOUNCING THE LAWSUIT, THE SEC STATED THAT IT WOULD NOT BRING AN ENFORCEMENT ACTION

AGAINST THE COMPANY BASED IN PART ON THE COMPANY'S "SWIFT, EXTENSIVE, AND EXTRAORDINARY COOPERATION IN THE COMMISSION'S INVESTIGATION." ACCORDING TO THE SEC'S STATEMENT, THE COMPANY'S "COOPERATION

CONSISTED OF, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROMPT SELF-REPORTING, AN INDEPENDENT INTERNAL INVESTIGATION, THE SHARING OF THE RESULTS OF THAT INVESTIGATION WITH THE GOVERNMENT, AND THE IMPLEMENTATION

OF NEW CONTROLS DESIGNED TO PREVENT THE RECURRENCE OF FRAUDULENT CONDUCT."

NO

ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN REGARDING THE OUTCOMES FROM LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, OR GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS RELATING TO THE COMPANY'S PAST STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. THESE AND RELATED

MATTERS HAVE REQUIRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE, THE COMPANY TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES FOR LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, TAX, AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, AND MAY DIVERT MANAGEMENT'S ATTENTION FROM

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS. IF THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO ADVERSE FINDINGS, IT COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY DAMAGES AND PENALTIES AND MIGHT FACE ADDITIONAL REMEDIES THAT COULD HARM ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

OPERATING RESULTS.

GLOBAL MARKETS FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS, DIGITAL MUSIC DEVICES, MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES, AND RELATED PERIPHERALS AND SERVICES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID

TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THESE MARKETS, ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY COMPETES IN GLOBAL MARKETS THAT ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE PRICE CUTTING, WITH ITS RESULTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGINS,

FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTS, SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT PRICE/PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS, RAPID ADOPTION OF

TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT ADVANCEMENTS BY COMPETITORS, AND PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS.

THE

COMPANY'S ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY DEPENDS HEAVILY ON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY INTRODUCTION OF NEW INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES IT IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT DESIGNS AND DEVELOPS VIRTUALLY THE ENTIRE SOLUTION FOR ITS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES, INCLUDING THE HARDWARE,

OPERATING SYSTEM, SEVERAL SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, AND RELATED SERVICES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MUST MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. BY CONTRAST, MANY OF THE COMPANY'S

COMPETITORS SEEK TO COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY ON PRICE AND MAINTAIN VERY LOW COST STRUCTURES. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND SELL INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS WITH ATTRACTIVE MARGINS, ITS

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN

THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND PERIPHERALS, THE COMPANY FACES A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, MANY OF WHICH HAVE BROADER PRODUCT LINES AND LARGER INSTALLED CUSTOMER BASES. THERE HAS

ALSO BEEN A TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION THAT HAS RESULTED IN LARGER AND POTENTIALLY STRONGER COMPETITORS. PRICE COMPETITION HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE AS COMPETITORS SELLING WINDOWS-BASED PERSONAL

COMPUTERS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED PRODUCT MARGINS. THE COMPANY ALSO FACES INCREASED COMPETITION IN CERTAIN OF ITS KEY MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING CONSUMER, EDUCATION, PROFESSIONAL AND

CONSUMER DIGITAL VIDEO EDITING, AND DESIGN AND PUBLISHING. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT INCLUDE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND ARE SMALLER AND SIMPLER THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS

COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH THE COMPANY'S EXISTING PRODUCTS.

14

THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY MAKER OF HARDWARE USING THE MAC OS. THE MAC OS HAS A MINORITY MARKET SHARE IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET, WHICH IS DOMINATED BY MAKERS OF COMPUTERS USING COMPETING

OPERATING SYSTEMS, MOST NOTABLY WINDOWS. THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS SUBSTANTIALLY DEPEND ON ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MAC PLATFORM TO MAINTAIN

PERCEIVED DESIGN AND FUNCTIONAL ADVANTAGES. USE OF UNAUTHORIZED COPIES OF THE MAC OS ON OTHER COMPANIES' HARDWARE PRODUCTS MAY RESULT IN DECREASED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS, AND

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO DIGITAL CONTENT DISTRIBUTION, CONSUMER ELECTRONIC DEVICES, INCLUDING IPOD AND APPLE TV, AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES, INCLUDING IPHONE.

THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, AND OTHER RESOURCES, AS WELL AS ESTABLISHED HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND DIGITAL CONTENT

SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS, AND ALSO COMPETES WITH ILLEGITIMATE WAYS TO OBTAIN DIGITAL CONTENT. THE COMPANY EXPECTS COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS COMPETITORS ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THE COMPANY'S APPROACH TO

PROVIDING THESE COMPONENTS SEAMLESSLY WITHIN THEIR INDIVIDUAL OFFERINGS OR WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO OFFER INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS. SOME CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND

EXPERIENCE, AND THEY MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO PROFIT OR EVEN AT A LOSS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES THAT EFFECTIVELY COMPETE.

TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND, THE COMPANY MUST SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS.

DUE TO THE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUALLY INTRODUCE NEW

PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES, ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS, AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR NEW AND UPGRADED PRODUCTS. THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING TIMELY AND SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION RAMP ISSUES, THE

AVAILABILITY OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR NEW PRODUCTS, THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND INVENTORY LEVELS IN LINE WITH ANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEMAND, THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN

APPROPRIATE QUANTITIES AND COSTS TO MEET ANTICIPATED DEMAND, AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR

OTHER DEFECTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE IN ADVANCE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS WILL HAVE ON FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY AND OTHER ASSET RISK.

THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR PRODUCT AND COMPONENT INVENTORIES THAT HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AND

ACCRUES NECESSARY RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION FEES FOR ORDERS OF PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED. THE COMPANY ALSO REVIEWS ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER

EVENTS OR CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT IMPAIRMENT EXISTS, IT RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN EQUAL TO THE

AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS INVENTORY, ASSET, AND RELATED PROVISIONS ARE CURRENTLY ADEQUATE, GIVEN THE RAPID AND

UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE IN THE GLOBAL PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR

ADDITIONAL INVENTORY OR ASSET RELATED CHARGES. SUCH CHARGES HAVE HAD, AND MAY HAVE, A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE

COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND SHIPMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S MARKETS ARE VOLATILE, COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID

TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, THERE IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND ORDER OR PRODUCE EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS OR PRODUCTS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY

PRACTICE, COMPONENTS ARE NORMALLY ACQUIRED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER FORECASTED

COMPONENT AND

15

MANUFACTURING

REQUIREMENTS FOR 30 TO 150 DAYS. THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE

COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY LEVELS AND RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND UPON THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO OBTAIN KEY COMPONENTS, INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND NAND FLASH MEMORY, AT FAVORABLE PRICES AND IN SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY CURRENTLY OBTAINS CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS, INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS, ENCLOSURES, CERTAIN LCDS, CERTAIN OPTICAL DRIVES, AND APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED

CIRCUITS ("ASICS"), FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT SUPPLY AND PRICING RISKS. MANY OF THESE AND OTHER KEY COMPONENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES,

INCLUDING NAND FLASH MEMORY, DRAM MEMORY, AND CERTAIN LCDS, ARE SUBJECT AT TIMES TO INDUSTRY-WIDE SHORTAGES AND SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY PRICING FLUCTUATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO

CERTAIN AGREEMENTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS AT FAVORABLE PRICING, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE

ABLE TO EXTEND OR RENEW THESE AGREEMENTS ON FAVORABLE TERMS UPON EXPIRATION OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN FAVORABLE PRICING IN THE FUTURE. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF SUPPLY

SHORTAGES AND/OR PRICE INCREASES THAT CAN HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO EXPERIENCE DECREASES IN ITS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN

FISCAL YEAR 2008, AS COMPARED TO LEVELS ACHIEVED DURING FISCAL YEAR 2007, DUE IN PART TO CURRENT AND EXPECTED FUTURE PRICE INCREASES FOR CERTAIN COMPONENTS. SEE "MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONSGROSS MARGIN."

THE

COMPANY'S NEW PRODUCTS OFTEN USE CUSTOM COMPONENTS FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. WHERE A

COMPONENT OR PRODUCT USES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL THE SUPPLIERS' YIELDS HAVE MATURED. THE COMPANY AND OTHER PRODUCERS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER

ELECTRONICS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES ALSO COMPETE FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY USES SOME CUSTOM

COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS OR MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES MAY BE

AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMPONENTS OTHER THAN THOSE CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY COMPONENT FOR A NEW OR EXISTING

PRODUCT WERE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED, OR IF SUCH COMPONENTS WERE AVAILABLE ONLY AT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PRICES, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON COMPONENT AND PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICS SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES, MANY OF WHOM ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.

MOST OF THE COMPANY'S COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS, MOST OF WHICH ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. A SIGNIFICANT

CONCENTRATION OF THIS OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURING IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY ONLY A FEW THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS, OFTEN IN SINGLE LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO OUTSOURCED MUCH OF ITS TRANSPORTATION AND

LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT. WHILE THESE ARRANGEMENTS MAY LOWER OPERATING COSTS, THEY ALSO REDUCE THE COMPANY'S DIRECT CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT EFFECT SUCH DIMINISHED

CONTROL WILL HAVE ON THE QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR THE COMPANY'S FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RELIES ON THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS TO

ADHERE TO THE COMPANY'S SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT. ALTHOUGH ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUCH MANUFACTURERS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT, THE COMPANY MAY REMAIN RESPONSIBLE TO THE

CONSUMER FOR WARRANTY SERVICE IN THE EVENT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS. ANY UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEFECT OR WARRANTY LIABILITY, WHETHER PURSUANT TO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR OTHERWISE, COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S REPUTATION, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

FINAL

ASSEMBLY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED IN THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN CORK, IRELAND, AND BY EXTERNAL VENDORS IN CALIFORNIA, KOREA, CHINA AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC.

CURRENTLY,

16

THE

SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURE OF MANY CRITICAL COMPONENTS IS PERFORMED BY SOLE-SOURCED THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN THE U.S., CHINA, JAPAN, KOREA, AND SINGAPORE. SOLE-SOURCED THIRD-

PARTY VENDORS IN CHINA PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MACBOOK PROS, MACBOOKS, IPODS AND IPHONES. IF MANUFACTURING OR LOGISTICS IN THESE

LOCATIONS IS DISRUPTED FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING NATURAL DISASTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES, MILITARY ACTIONS OR ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, LABOR, ENVIRONMENTAL, PUBLIC HEALTH, OR POLITICAL

ISSUES, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO OFFER THEIR DIGITAL CONTENT THROUGH THE COMPANY'S ITUNES STORE. THE COMPANY PAYS SUBSTANTIAL FEES TO OBTAIN THE RIGHTS TO THIS

CONTENT. THE COMPANY'S LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THESE THIRD PARTIES ARE SHORT-TERM AND DO NOT GUARANTEE THE CONTINUATION OR RENEWAL OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS ON REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL.

SOME THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS CURRENTLY OR MAY IN THE FUTURE OFFER COMPETING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND COULD TAKE ACTION TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO LICENSE THEIR

CONTENT IN THE FUTURE. OTHER CONTENT OWNERS, PROVIDERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAY SEEK TO LIMIT THE COMPANY'S ACCESS TO, OR INCREASE THE TOTAL COST OF, SUCH CONTENT. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO

OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF CONTENT AT REASONABLE PRICES WITH ACCEPTABLE USAGE RULES, OR CONTINUE TO EXPAND ITS GEOGRAPHIC REACH, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

MANY

THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY PROVIDE CERTAIN DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT ("DRM") AND OTHER SECURITY SOLUTIONS. IF THESE REQUIREMENTS CHANGE, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO

DEVELOP OR LICENSE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE THESE SOLUTIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OR LICENSE SUCH SOLUTIONS AT A REASONABLE COST AND IN A TIMELY MANNER. IN

ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES HAVE PASSED OR MAY PROPOSE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD FORCE THE COMPANY TO LICENSE ITS DRM, WHICH COULD LESSEN THE PROTECTION OF CONTENT AND SUBJECT IT TO PIRACY AND COULD ALSO

AFFECT ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE COMPANY'S CONTENT PROVIDERS.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND THE COMPANY'S FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF IT IS ALLEGED

OR FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

MANY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS

ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE,

SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

BECAUSE

OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE GLOBAL PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES, CURRENT EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT

IS POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE THE PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE

COMPANY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING SUCH RIGHTS. RESPONDING TO SUCH CLAIMS, REGARDLESS OF THEIR MERIT, CAN CONSUME SIGNIFICANT TIME AND EXPENSE, AND SEVERAL PENDING CLAIMS ARE IN

VARIOUS STAGES OF EVALUATION. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER THE DESIRABILITY OF ENTERING INTO LICENSING AGREEMENTS, ALTHOUGH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED

ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR THAT LITIGATION WILL NOT OCCUR. IF THERE IS A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION PROHIBITING THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING OR SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM OF

INFRINGEMENT AGAINST THE COMPANY REQUIRES IT TO PAY ROYALTIES TO A THIRD PARTY, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. INFORMATION REGARDING

CERTAIN CLAIMS AND LITIGATION RELATED TO ALLEGED PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND OTHER MATTERS IS SET FORTH IN PART I, ITEM 3, "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS." IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A

POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES FROM ANY KNOWN CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS RELATED TO THE INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR

IN THE

17

AGGREGATE

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO

PREVAIL IN ANY OF THE MATTERS RELATED TO INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 3, "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS," OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE

MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WITH

THE JUNE 2007 INTRODUCTION OF IPHONE, THE COMPANY HAS BEGUN TO COMPETE WITH MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICE COMPANIES THAT HOLD SIGNIFICANT PATENT PORTFOLIOS. REGARDLESS OF THE SCOPE OR VALIDITY OF

SUCH PATENTS OR THE MERITS OF ANY POTENTIAL PATENT CLAIMS BY COMPETITORS, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ENGAGE IN PROTRACTED LITIGATION, ENTER INTO EXPENSIVE AGREEMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS AND/OR MODIFY ITS

PRODUCTS. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS EXPERIENCE QUALITY PROBLEMS FROM TIME TO TIME THAT CAN RESULT IN DECREASED SALES AND OPERATING MARGIN.

THE COMPANY SELLS HIGHLY COMPLEX HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT CAN CONTAIN DEFECTS IN DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE. SOPHISTICATED OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS,

SUCH AS THOSE SOLD BY THE COMPANY, OFTEN CONTAIN "BUGS" THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE WITH THE SOFTWARE'S OPERATION. DEFECTS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THE COMPANY PURCHASES FROM

THIRD PARTIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT AND FIX ALL DEFECTS IN THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE IT SELLS. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE, HARM TO

REPUTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT WARRANTY AND

OTHER EXPENSES, AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS QUARTERLY REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS.

THE COMPANY'S PROFIT MARGINS VARY AMONG ITS PRODUCTS AND ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE COMPANY'S SOFTWARE, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER

GROSS MARGINS THAN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S OTHER PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY CONTENT FROM THE ITUNES STORE. GROSS MARGINS ON THE COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS VARY ACROSS PRODUCT LINES AND CAN

CHANGE OVER TIME AS A RESULT OF PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, PRICING AND CONFIGURATION CHANGES, AND COMPONENT, WARRANTY, AND OTHER COST FLUCTUATIONS. THE COMPANY'S DIRECT SALES GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER

ASSOCIATED GROSS MARGINS THAN ITS INDIRECT SALES THROUGH ITS CHANNEL PARTNERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY'S GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES, AS WELL AS OVERALL PROFITABILITY, MAY BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIC OR CHANNEL MIX, OR NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY SELLS MORE PRODUCTS DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF EACH

QUARTER THAN IT DOES DURING EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO MONTHS. THIS SALES PATTERN CAN PRODUCE PRESSURE ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF A QUARTER AND MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PREDICT ITS FINANCIAL RESULTS ACCURATELY. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY HAS TYPICALLY EXPERIENCED GREATER NET SALES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS COMPARED TO OTHER

QUARTERS IN THE FISCAL YEAR DUE TO SEASONAL DEMAND RELATED TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. DEVELOPMENTS LATE IN A QUARTER, SUCH AS

LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, AN INTERNAL SYSTEMS FAILURE, OR FAILURE OF ONE OF THE COMPANY'S KEY LOGISTICS, COMPONENTS SUPPLY, OR MANUFACTURING

PARTNERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY RELIES ON A SINGLE CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIER FOR IPHONE IN EACH OF THE U.S., U.K., GERMANY AND FRANCE.

AT&T, O2, T-MOBILE AND ORANGE ARE THE COMPANY'S CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS FOR IPHONE IN THE U.S., U.K., GERMANY AND FRANCE, RESPECTIVELY. IF THESE CARRIERS CANNOT

SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE WITH OTHER CARRIERS IN THEIR MARKETS FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE QUALITY AND COVERAGE OF WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES, PERFORMANCE AND TIMELY

BUILD-OUT OF ADVANCED WIRELESS NETWORKS, AND PRICING AND TERMS OF

18

END-USER

CONTRACTS, IPHONE SALES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S AGREEMENTS REQUIRE EACH CARRIER TO MAKE REVENUE-GENERATING PAYMENTS TO THE COMPANY, A CARRIER'S

NON-PERFORMANCE UNDER OR TERMINATION OF AN AGREEMENT, OR ITS INABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN IPHONE CUSTOMERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FUTURE FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. IF, CONTRARY TO THE COMPANY'S LICENSE AGREEMENTS OR PRODUCT SPECIFICATIONS, AN IPHONE IS "UNLOCKED" FROM AN AUTHORIZED CARRIER'S NETWORK, THE COMPANY WOULD NOT RECEIVE

PAYMENTS RELATED TO THAT IPHONE FROM SUCH CARRIER, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FUTURE FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE TO ENTER INTO

ARRANGEMENTS WITH CARRIERS IN OTHER COUNTRIES OR REGIONS, AND THE SAME RISKS DESCRIBED ABOVE WOULD ALSO APPLY TO THOSE ARRANGEMENTS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY-IMPOSED STANDARDS RELATED TO MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES.

LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS DEVICES IN THE MANY JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES ARE EXTENSIVE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE. SUCH CHANGES, WHICH

COULD INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCTION, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION, AND USE OF THE DEVICE, LOCKING THE DEVICE TO A CARRIER'S NETWORK, OR MANDATING THE USE OF THE DEVICE ON MORE

THAN ONE CARRIER'S NETWORK, MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

MOBILE

COMMUNICATION DEVICES, SUCH AS IPHONE, ARE SUBJECT TO CERTIFICATION AND REGULATION BY GOVERNMENTAL AND STANDARDIZATION BODIES, AS WELL AS BY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS FOR USE ON THEIR NETWORKS.

THESE CERTIFICATION PROCESSES ARE EXTENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING, AND COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL TESTING REQUIREMENTS, PRODUCT MODIFICATIONS OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT SHIPMENT DATES, WHICH MAY HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

FAILURE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND BREACHES IN DATA SECURITY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES AND BREACHES OF DATA SECURITY COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS BY CAUSING DELAYS OR CANCELLATION OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, IMPEDING THE

MANUFACTURE OR SHIPMENT OF PRODUCTS, OR RESULTING IN THE UNINTENTIONAL DISCLOSURE OF CUSTOMER OR COMPANY INFORMATION. MANAGEMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS BY IMPLEMENTING SOPHISTICATED

NETWORK SECURITY AND INTERNAL CONTROL MEASURES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT A SYSTEM FAILURE OR DATA SECURITY BREACH WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S STOCK PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE.

THE COMPANY'S STOCK HAS AT TIMES EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY AS A RESULT OF VARIATIONS BETWEEN ITS ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND AS A RESULT OF

ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND ITS COMPETITORS. THE STOCK MARKET AS A WHOLE HAS ALSO EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY

COMPANIES IN WAYS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN UNRELATED TO THESE COMPANIES' OPERATING PERFORMANCE. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS STOCK PRICE REFLECTS HIGH FUTURE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY EXPECTATIONS.

IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MEET THESE EXPECTATIONS ITS STOCK PRICE MAY SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINE.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, POLITICAL EVENTS, WAR, TERRORISM, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. WAR, TERRORISM, GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER

BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS HAVE CAUSED AND COULD CAUSE DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION TO INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AND THUS MAY HAVE A STRONG NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY, ITS SUPPLIERS,

LOGISTICS PROVIDERS, MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERRUPTION BY NATURAL DISASTERS, FIRE, POWER SHORTAGES, TERRORIST ATTACKS, AND OTHER

HOSTILE ACTS, LABOR DISPUTES, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER EVENTS BEYOND ITS CONTROL. SUCH EVENTS COULD DECREASE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR

19

IMPOSSIBLE

FOR THE COMPANY TO MAKE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS OR TO RECEIVE COMPONENTS FROM ITS SUPPLIERS, AND CREATE DELAYS AND INEFFICIENCIES IN THE COMPANY'S SUPPLY CHAIN. SHOULD MAJOR

PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING PANDEMICS, ARISE, THE COMPANY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY MORE STRINGENT EMPLOYEE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS IN FREIGHT SERVICES, GOVERNMENTAL

ACTIONS LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS BETWEEN REGIONS, DELAYS IN PRODUCTION RAMPS OF NEW PRODUCTS, AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY'S MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS.

THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, ITS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN COMPONENT

SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS, ARE LOCATED NEAR MAJOR SEISMIC FAULTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY DOES NOT CARRY EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE FOR DIRECT QUAKE-RELATED LOSSES AND SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY TIME COULD

BE REQUIRED TO RESUME OPERATIONS, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE.

THE COMPANY'S SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

MUCH OF THE COMPANY'S FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED PERSONNEL, INCLUDING ITS CEO, ITS EXECUTIVE TEAM AND KEY EMPLOYEES IN

TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF POSITIONS. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY, WHERE THE

MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S KEY EMPLOYEES ARE LOCATED. THE COMPANY HAS RELIED ON EQUITY AWARDS AS ONE MEANS FOR RECRUITING AND RETAINING THIS HIGHLY SKILLED TALENT. RECENT ACCOUNTING REGULATIONS

REQUIRING THE EXPENSING OF STOCK OPTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, WHICH HAS CAUSED THE COMPANY TO REDUCE THE NUMBER OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES. THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

UNFAVORABLE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 3, "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS." THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO OTHER LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY ADJUDICATED. RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. REGARDLESS OF ITS

MERIT, LITIGATION MAY BE BOTH

TIME-CONSUMING AND DISRUPTIVE TO THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND CAUSE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT ATTENTION. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN CERTAIN MATTERS, OR

SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A LARGE PORTION OF ITS REVENUE FROM ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED

BY RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND LABOR CONDITIONS, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, TAX LAWS (INCLUDING U.S. TAXES ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES), AND CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF

THE U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS LOCAL CURRENCIES. MARGINS ON SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, CAN BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES.

THE

COMPANY'S PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATE TO NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SALES IN EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, AND CERTAIN PARTS OF ASIA

AND NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED OPERATING EXPENSES INCURRED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WEAKNESSES IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PARTICULARLY THE JAPANESE YEN AND THE EURO, CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES. CONVERSELY, A STRENGTHENING IN THESE AND OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCIES CAN CAUSE THE COMPANY TO MODIFY

INTERNATIONAL PRICING AND AFFECT THE VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN DENOMINATED SALES AND MAY ALSO INCREASE THE COST OF PRODUCT COMPONENTS.

20

THE

COMPANY HAS USED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS, TO HEDGE EXPOSURES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF SUCH HEDGING

ACTIVITIES MAY NOT OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECT RESULTING FROM UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.

FURTHER

INFORMATION RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S GLOBAL MARKET RISKS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 7A, "QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK," UNDER THE SUBHEADING "FOREIGN

CURRENCY RISK," AND IN PART II, ITEM 8, "FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND SUPPLEMENTARY DATA," AT NOTE 1, "SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICES" AND NOTE 2, "FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS"

OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY'S RETAIL INITIATIVE HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT AND COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES AND IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES.

THROUGH SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD OPENED 197 RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANY'S RETAIL INITIATIVE HAS REQUIRED SUBSTANTIAL FIXED INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INVENTORY, AND PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO ENTERED INTO SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS FOR RETAIL SPACE WITH TERMS RANGING FROM 5 TO

20 YEARS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE FOR 10 YEARS. CERTAIN STORES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SERVE AS HIGH-PROFILE VENUES TO PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND SERVE AS VEHICLES

FOR CORPORATE SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN ELEMENTS, LOCATIONS AND SIZE, THESE STORES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVESTMENT THAN THE COMPANY'S MORE TYPICAL RETAIL

STORES. A SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN SALES, THE CLOSURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL OR MULTIPLE STORES, OR THE TERMINATION OF THE RETAIL INITIATIVE COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LEASE TERMINATION

COSTS, WRITE-OFFS OF EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, AND SEVERANCE COSTS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

MANY

FACTORS UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANY'S CONTROL, POSE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S FUTURE RESULTS,

CAUSE ITS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM ANTICIPATED RESULTS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON GENERAL RETAIL ACTIVITY, INABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STORE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION, INABILITY TO SELL THIRD-PARTY

PRODUCTS AT ADEQUATE MARGINS, FAILURE TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS; LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING RETAIL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S., COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

UNANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF RETAIL INVENTORY, AND INABILITY TO OBTAIN AND RENEW LEASES IN QUALITY RETAIL LOCATIONS AT A REASONABLE COST.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE PERFORMANCE DEPENDS ON SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. IF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS CEASE TO BE DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED FOR THE

COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS, CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE NOT TO BUY THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES DECISIONS BY CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE THE COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS ARE OFTEN BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION SOFTWARE, SUCH AS

MICROSOFT OFFICE. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN APPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL, AND

DISCONTINUANCE OR DELAY OF THESE APPLICATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY

APPLICATIONS DEPENDS IN PART ON THE DEVELOPERS' PERCEPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING, MAINTAINING, AND UPGRADING SUCH SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS VERSUS WINDOWS-BASED

PRODUCTS. THIS ANALYSIS MAY BE BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE PERCEIVED STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTS, THE ANTICIPATED REVENUE THAT MAY BE GENERATED, CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE BY CUSTOMERS OF MAC

OS X, AND THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING SUCH APPLICATIONS. IF THE COMPANY'S MINORITY SHARE OF THE GLOBAL PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET CAUSES DEVELOPERS TO QUESTION THE COMPANY'S PROSPECTS, DEVELOPERS COULD BE

LESS INCLINED TO DEVELOP OR UPGRADE SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND MORE INCLINED TO DEVOTE THEIR RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING AND UPGRADING SOFTWARE FOR THE LARGER WINDOWS MARKET. THE COMPANY'S

DEVELOPMENT OF ITS OWN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT

21

THE

DECISIONS OF THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS, SUCH AS MICROSOFT AND ADOBE, TO DEVELOP, MAINTAIN, AND UPGRADE SIMILAR OR COMPETITIVE SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. MAC OS X LEOPARD, WHICH BECAME

AVAILABLE IN OCTOBER 2007, INCLUDES A NEW FEATURE THAT ENABLES INTEL-BASED MAC SYSTEMS TO RUN WINDOWS XP AND WINDOWS VISTA. THIS FEATURE MAY DETER DEVELOPERS FROM CREATING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS

FOR MAC OS X IF SUCH APPLICATIONS ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE FOR THE WINDOWS PLATFORM.

DURING

CALENDAR YEAR 2006, THE COMPANY TRANSITIONED ITS MAC LINE OF COMPUTERS FROM POWERPC TO INTEL MICROPROCESSORS. THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS TO TIMELY DEVELOP CURRENT AND FUTURE

UNIVERSAL APPLICATIONS. A UNIVERSAL VERSION OF MICROSOFT OFFICE AND CERTAIN OTHER IMPORTANT APPLICATIONS ARE CURRENTLY NOT AVAILABLE. THE LACK OF UNIVERSAL APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON INTEL-BASED MAC

SYSTEMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

INVESTMENT IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANY'S ONGOING BUSINESS AND PRESENT RISKS NOT ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED.

THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED, AND MAY IN THE FUTURE INVEST, IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES OR ACQUISITIONS. SUCH ENDEAVORS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING

DISTRACTION OF MANAGEMENT FROM CURRENT OPERATIONS, INSUFFICIENT REVENUE TO OFFSET LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRATEGY, INADEQUATE RETURN OF CAPITAL, AND UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES

NOT DISCOVERED IN THE COMPANY'S DUE DILIGENCE. BECAUSE THESE NEW VENTURES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE DEPENDS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER RESELLERS.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, AND CATALOGUERS, MANY OF WHOM DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS

FROM COMPETING MANUFACTURERS. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND RESELLS THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO END-USERS, CERTAIN EDUCATION CUSTOMERS,

AND CERTAIN RESELLERS THROUGH ITS ONLINE AND RETAIL STORES. IPHONE IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH THE COMPANY AND ITS EXCLUSIVE CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS' DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

MANY

RESELLERS OPERATE ON NARROW PRODUCT MARGINS AND HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IN THE PAST BY WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. SOME RESELLERS HAVE PERCEIVED THE EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY'S DIRECT SALES AS

CONFLICTING WITH THEIR BUSINESS INTERESTS AS DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. SUCH A PERCEPTION COULD DISCOURAGE RESELLERS FROM INVESTING RESOURCES IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS OR LEAD THEM TO LIMIT OR CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF THESE RESELLERS WEAKENS, IF RESELLERS STOPPED DISTRIBUTING THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, OR IF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS CAUSED RESELLERS TO REDUCE THEIR ORDERING

AND MARKETING OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE RESELLER SALES, INCLUDING STAFFING SELECTED RESELLERS' STORES WITH COMPANY

EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS AND IMPROVING PRODUCT PLACEMENT DISPLAYS. THESE PROGRAMS COULD REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT WHILE PROVIDING NO ASSURANCE OF RETURN OR INCREMENTAL REVENUE.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PREPAYMENTS RELATED TO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS. THIS RISK IS HEIGHTENED DURING PERIODS WHEN

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORSEN.

A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL OR CREDIT INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS UNSECURED NON-TRADE

RECEIVABLES RESULTING FROM THE SALE BY THE COMPANY OF COMPONENTS TO VENDORS WHO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED

INTO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO SECURE SUPPLY OF NAND FLASH-MEMORY AND HAS PREPAID A TOTAL OF $1.25 BILLION UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, OF WHICH $208 MILLION HAD BEEN USED AS

OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES TO MONITOR AND

22

LIMIT

EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE AND NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES AS WELL AS LONG-TERM PREPAYMENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE SUCH PROCEDURES WILL EFFECTIVELY LIMIT ITS

CREDIT RISK AND AVOID LOSSES.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO HEALTH, SAFETY AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE GOODS AND SERVICES, ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE MAY REQUIRE THE

COMPANY TO OFFER CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO RETURN A PRODUCT AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND

REGULATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PASSED IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, INCLUDING VARIOUS COUNTRIES WITHIN EUROPE AND ASIA, CERTAIN CANADIAN PROVINCES AND CERTAIN STATES WITHIN

THE U.S. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE

LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S TAX RATES COULD AFFECT ITS FUTURE RESULTS.

THE COMPANY'S FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR BY CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION. THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE

AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVAILABILITY AND COVERAGE OF INSURANCE.

FOR CERTAIN RISKS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE BECAUSE OF COST AND/OR AVAILABILITY. BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS SOME PORTION OF ITS INSURABLE RISKS, AND IN

SOME CASES SELF-INSURES COMPLETELY, UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC LOSSES IN EXCESS OF INSURED LIMITS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING

RESULTS.

PROFESSIONAL, BUSINESS, AND GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS. FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS MAY BE FOUND IN PART I, ITEM 1 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING "BUSINESS."

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT FOR BOTH PROFESSIONALS AND CONSUMERS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER HAS BECOME THE CENTER OF AN EVOLVING DIGITAL LIFESTYLE BY INTEGRATING WITH AND ENHANCING THE UTILITY OF ADVANCED

DIGITAL DEVICES SUCH AS THE COMPANY'S IPODS, IPHONES, DIGITAL VIDEO AND STILL CAMERAS, TELEVISIONS, PERSONAL DIGITAL ASSISTANTS, AND OTHER DIGITAL DEVICES. THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER THAT

ENABLE THIS FUNCTIONALITY INCLUDE A HIGH-QUALITY USER INTERFACE, EASY ACCESS TO RELATIVELY INEXPENSIVE DATA STORAGE, THE ABILITY TO RUN COMPLEX APPLICATIONS, AND THE ABILITY TO CONNECT

EASILY TO A WIDE VARIETY OF OTHER DIGITAL DEVICES AND TO THE INTERNET. THE COMPANY IS THE ONLY PARTICIPANT IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY THAT CONTROLS THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF THE ENTIRE

PERSONAL COMPUTERFROM THE HARDWARE AND OPERATING SYSTEM TO SOPHISTICATED APPLICATIONS. THIS, ALONG WITH ITS PRODUCTS' CREATIVE INDUSTRIAL DESIGNS, INTUITIVE

EASE-OF-USE, AND BUILT-IN GRAPHICS, MULTIMEDIA AND NETWORKING CAPABILITIES, UNIQUELY POSITIONS THE COMPANY TO OFFER INNOVATIVE INTEGRATED DIGITAL LIFESTYLE

SOLUTIONS.

THE

COMPANY'S BUSINESS STRATEGY LEVERAGES ITS ABILITY, THROUGH THE DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT OF ITS OWN OPERATING SYSTEM, HARDWARE, AND MANY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGIES, TO BRING TO ITS

CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD COMPELLING NEW PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS WITH SUPERIOR EASE-OF-USE, SEAMLESS INTEGRATION, AND INNOVATIVE INDUSTRIAL DESIGN.

THE

COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN SEVERAL HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETS, INCLUDING PERSONAL COMPUTERS WITH ITS MAC LINE OF COMPUTERS, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS WITH ITS IPOD PRODUCT FAMILY OF PORTABLE DIGITAL MUSIC

PLAYERS, AND DISTRIBUTION OF THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT THROUGH ITS ONLINE ITUNES STORE. WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF IPHONE, THE COMPANY HAS ALSO BEGUN TO COMPETE WITH MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICE

COMPANIES THAT HAVE SUBSTANTIAL EXPERIENCE AND TECHNOLOGICAL AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. WHILE THE COMPANY IS WIDELY RECOGNIZED AS A LEADING INNOVATOR IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS

MARKETS AS WELL AS A LEADER IN THE EMERGING MARKET FOR DISTRIBUTION OF DIGITAL CONTENT, THESE MARKETS ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO

36

AGGRESSIVE

PRICING. TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT INCREASED INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ("R&D") AND MARKETING AND ADVERTISING IS NECESSARY TO MAINTAIN OR EXPAND ITS

POSITION IN THE MARKETS WHERE IT COMPETES. THE COMPANY'S R&D SPENDING IS FOCUSED ON FURTHER DEVELOPING ITS EXISTING LINE OF PERSONAL COMPUTERS, OPERATING SYSTEMS, APPLICATION SOFTWARE, AND PORTABLE

DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS; DEVELOPING NEW DIGITAL LIFESTYLE CONSUMER AND PROFESSIONAL SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS; AND INVESTING IN NEW PRODUCT AREAS SUCH AS IPHONE AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES. THE COMPANY ALSO

BELIEVES INCREASED INVESTMENT IN MARKETING AND ADVERTISING PROGRAMS IS CRITICAL TO INCREASING PRODUCT AND BRAND AWARENESS.

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES A VARIETY OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT SALES OF ITS INNOVATIVE AND DIFFERENTIATED PRODUCTS ARE ENHANCED BY KNOWLEDGEABLE SALESPERSONS

WHO CAN CONVEY THE VALUE OF THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND PERIPHERAL INTEGRATION, DEMONSTRATE THE UNIQUE DIGITAL LIFESTYLE SOLUTIONS THAT ARE AVAILABLE ONLY ON MAC COMPUTERS, AND DEMONSTRATE THE

COMPATIBILITY OF THE MAC WITH THE WINDOWS PLATFORM AND NETWORKS. THE COMPANY FURTHER BELIEVES PROVIDING A HIGH-QUALITY SALES AND AFTER-SALES SUPPORT EXPERIENCE IS CRITICAL TO ATTRACTING

AND RETAINING

CUSTOMERS. TO ENSURE A HIGH-QUALITY BUYING EXPERIENCE FOR ITS PRODUCTS IN WHICH SERVICE AND EDUCATION ARE EMPHASIZED, THE COMPANY HAS EXPANDED AND IMPROVED ITS DISTRIBUTION CAPABILITIES BY

OPENING ITS OWN RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY. THE COMPANY HAD 197 STORES OPEN AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007.

COMPANY ALSO STAFFS SELECTED THIRD-PARTY STORES WITH THE COMPANY'S OWN EMPLOYEES TO IMPROVE THE BUYING EXPERIENCE THROUGH RESELLER CHANNELS. THE COMPANY HAS DEPLOYED APPLE EMPLOYEES AND

CONTRACTORS IN RESELLER LOCATIONS AROUND THE WORLD INCLUDING THE U.S., CANADA, EUROPE, JAPAN, ASIA, LATIN AMERICA AND AUSTRALIA. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS TO CUSTOMERS DIRECTLY THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED DISCLOSURES IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND THE COMPANY'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS REQUIRE THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS, ASSUMPTIONS, AND ESTIMATES THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. NOTE 1 "SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES" OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K DESCRIBES THE SIGNIFICANT

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND METHODS USED IN THE PREPARATION OF THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS IT

BELIEVES TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE

ESTIMATES AND SUCH DIFFERENCES MAY BE MATERIAL.

MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES THE COMPANY'S CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES ARE THOSE RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION, ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, INVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE

COMMITMENTS, WARRANTY COSTS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, INCOME TAXES, AND LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES. MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THESE CRITICAL POLICIES BECAUSE THEY ARE BOTH IMPORTANT TO THE PORTRAYAL OF

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, AND THEY REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO MAKE JUDGMENTS

COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED

DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED, AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR MOST OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS

SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE

COMPANY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. IF AT THE OUTSET OF AN ARRANGEMENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS NOT, OR IS PRESUMED NOT TO BE, FIXED OR

DETERMINABLE, REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED AS AMOUNTS BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE AND ALL OTHER CRITERIA FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET.

DURING

2007, THE COMPANY BEGAN SHIPPING APPLE TV AND IPHONE. FOR BOTH APPLE TV AND IPHONE, THE COMPANY INDICATED IT MAY PROVIDE FUTURE UNSPECIFIED FEATURES AND ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS FREE OF

CHARGE TO CUSTOMERS. THEREFORE, SALES OF APPLE TV AND IPHONE HANDSETS ARE RECOGNIZED UNDER SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOP NO. 97-2. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE

ASSOCIATED REVENUE AND COST OF GOODS SOLD ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED 24-MONTH ECONOMIC LIVES OF THESE PRODUCTS WITH ANY LOSS RECOGNIZED AT THE

TIME OF SALE. COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR ENGINEERING, SALES, MARKETING AND WARRANTY ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

THE

COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING RESELLER AND END-USER REBATES, AND OTHER

SALES PROGRAMS AND VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES. FOR TRANSACTIONS INVOLVING PRICE PROTECTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE NET OF THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT TO BE REFUNDED, PROVIDED THE REFUND AMOUNT CAN BE

REASONABLY AND RELIABLY ESTIMATED AND THE OTHER CONDITIONS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION HAVE BEEN MET. IF REFUNDS CANNOT BE RELIABLY ESTIMATED, REVENUE IS NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL RELIABLE ESTIMATES CAN BE

MADE OR THE PRICE PROTECTION LAPSES. FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS RECOGNIZED AT THE LATER OF THE DATE AT WHICH THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT OR THE DATE

AT WHICH THE PROGRAM IS OFFERED. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. FUTURE MARKET CONDITIONS AND PRODUCT

TRANSITIONS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INCREASE CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS AND INCUR INCREMENTAL PRICE PROTECTION OBLIGATIONS THAT COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE AT THE TIME SUCH

PROGRAMS ARE OFFERED. ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRE MANAGEMENT TO ESTIMATE THE NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS WHO WILL ACTUALLY REDEEM THE INCENTIVE BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND

THE SPECIFIC TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF PARTICULAR INCENTIVE PROGRAMS. IF A GREATER THAN ESTIMATED PROPORTION OF CUSTOMERS REDEEM SUCH INCENTIVES, THE COMPANY

38

WOULD

BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE, WHICH WOULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATION, CONSUMER, AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY

DOES NOT REQUIRE COLLATERAL FROM ITS CUSTOMERS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY WILL REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN CERTAIN INSTANCES TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK. IN ADDITION, WHEN POSSIBLE THE COMPANY DOES ATTEMPT TO LIMIT

CREDIT RISK ON TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CREDIT INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN LATIN AMERICA, EUROPE, ASIA, AND AUSTRALIA BY ARRANGING WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES TO PROVIDE FLOORING

ARRANGEMENTS AND OTHER LOAN AND LEASE PROGRAMS TO THE COMPANY'S DIRECT CUSTOMERS. THESE CREDIT-FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANY AND THE END CUSTOMER. AS

SUCH, THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RECOURSE OR CREDIT RISK SHARING RELATED TO ANY OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER, CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL,

THIRD-PARTY FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS, OR CREDIT INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS.

THE

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS IS BASED ON MANAGEMENT'S ASSESSMENT OF THE COLLECTIBILITY OF SPECIFIC CUSTOMER ACCOUNTS AND INCLUDES CONSIDERATION OF THE CREDIT WORTHINESS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

OF THOSE SPECIFIC CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE THE SPECIFIC RECEIVABLES TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS REASONABLY BELIEVED TO BE COLLECTIBLE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS AN ALLOWANCE FOR

ALL OTHER TRADE RECEIVABLES BASED ON MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE WITH BAD DEBT, THE GENERAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS,

AND THE

AGING OF SUCH RECEIVABLES. IF THERE IS A DETERIORATION OF A MAJOR CUSTOMER'S FINANCIAL CONDITION, IF THE COMPANY BECOMES AWARE OF ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF A MAJOR

CUSTOMER, OR IF FUTURE ACTUAL DEFAULT RATES ON TRADE RECEIVABLES IN GENERAL DIFFER FROM THOSE CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ADJUST ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS, WHICH WOULD

AFFECT EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD THE ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE.

INVENTORY VALUATION AND INVENTORY PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF

COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS HELD FOR RESALE, WHICH HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. THE COMPANY PERFORMS A DETAILED

REVIEW OF INVENTORY EACH FISCAL QUARTER THAT CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS INCLUDING DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS, AND COMPONENT COST

TRENDS. THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRIES ARE SUBJECT TO A RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT AND COMPONENT OBSOLESCENCE AND DEMAND CHANGES. IF

FUTURE DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN FORECASTED OR IF UNFORESEEN TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE UTILITY OF COMPONENT INVENTORY, THE

COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL WRITE-DOWNS WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE WRITE-DOWNS WERE RECORDED.

THE

COMPANY ACCRUES RESERVES FOR ESTIMATED CANCELLATION FEES RELATED TO COMPONENT ORDERS THAT HAVE BEEN CANCELLED OR ARE EXPECTED TO BE CANCELLED. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY

ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. THESE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS

FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. IF THERE IS AN ABRUPT AND SUBSTANTIAL DECLINE IN DEMAND FOR ONE OR MORE OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS OR AN UNANTICIPATED CHANGE IN TECHNOLOGICAL

REQUIREMENTS FOR ANY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD ADDITIONAL RESERVES FOR CANCELLATION FEES THAT WOULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE

CANCELLATION FEES ARE IDENTIFIED AND RECORDED.

39

WARRANTY COSTS

THE COMPANY PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST FOR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM

RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED COST-PER-CLAIM, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY'S TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. EACH QUARTER, THE COMPANY

REEVALUATES ITS ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF ITS RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES CONSIDERING THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS

NECESSARY. FOR PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING PURSUANT TO SOP NO. 97-2, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES WARRANTY EXPENSE AS INCURRED. IF ACTUAL PRODUCT FAILURE RATES OR

REPAIR COSTS DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES, REVISIONS TO THE ESTIMATED WARRANTY LIABILITY WOULD BE REQUIRED AND COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE

COMPANY PERIODICALLY PROVIDES UPDATES TO ITS APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEM SOFTWARE TO MAINTAIN THE SOFTWARE'S COMPLIANCE WITH SPECIFICATIONS. THE ESTIMATED COST TO DEVELOP SUCH UPDATES IS ACCOUNTED FOR

AS WARRANTY COST THAT IS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME RELATED SOFTWARE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING APPROPRIATE ACCRUALS RELATED TO SUCH UPDATES INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF UNITS

DELIVERED, THE NUMBER OF UPDATES EXPECTED TO OCCUR, AND THE HISTORICAL COST AND ESTIMATED FUTURE COST OF THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP THESE UPDATES.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ("SFAS") NO. 123 (REVISED 2004) ("SFAS

NO. 123R"),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123R, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS ESTIMATED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED

ON THE AWARD'S FAIR-VALUE AS CALCULATED BY THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON ("BSM") OPTION-PRICING MODEL AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE

REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE BSM MODEL REQUIRES VARIOUS JUDGMENTAL ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING EXPECTED VOLATILITY, FORFEITURE RATES, AND EXPECTED OPTION LIFE. IF ANY OF THE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE BSM

MODEL CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY IN THE FUTURE FROM THAT RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY RECORDS A TAX PROVISION FOR THE ANTICIPATED TAX CONSEQUENCES OF THE REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

, THE

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS COMPUTED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY METHOD, UNDER WHICH DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES

ARE RECOGNIZED FOR THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE FINANCIAL REPORTING AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, AND FOR OPERATING LOSSES AND TAX CREDIT

CARRYFORWARDS. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE MEASURED USING THE CURRENTLY ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN EFFECT FOR THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TAX ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO BE

REALIZED OR SETTLED. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS TO THE AMOUNT THAT IS BELIEVED MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. IN THE EVENT THAT ALL OR PART OF THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE DETERMINED NOT TO BE REALIZABLE IN THE

FUTURE, AN ADJUSTMENT TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE WOULD BE CHARGED TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE. IN ADDITION, THE CALCULATION OF TAX LIABILITIES INVOLVES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IN

ESTIMATING THE IMPACT OF UNCERTAINTIES IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX LAWS. RESOLUTION OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES IN A MANNER INCONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

AS DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE HEADING "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" AND IN NOTE 8 "COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES" IN NOTES

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS

40

SUBJECT

TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. THE COMPANY RECORDS A CONTINGENT LIABILITY WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE

AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES

. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT REQUIRED IN BOTH THE

PROBABILITY DETERMINATION AND AS TO WHETHER AN EXPOSURE CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

AND CLAIMS THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT

AGAINST THE COMPANY ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN

THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

FISCAL YEAR 2007 VERSUS 2006

NET SALES DURING 2007 INCREASED 24% OR $4.7 BILLION FROM 2006 EVEN THOUGH THE FISCAL YEAR OF 2007 SPANNED 52 WEEKS WHILE THE FISCAL YEAR OF 2006 SPANNED 53 WEEKS.

SEVERAL FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THESE INCREASES INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



MAC

NET SALES INCREASED $3 BILLION OR 40% DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006, WHILE MAC UNIT SALES INCREASED BY 1.75 MILLION UNITS OR 33%. THE 33% MAC UNIT SALES

GROWTH RATE IS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN THE ESTIMATED GROWTH RATE OF THE OVERALL PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY DURING THAT TIMEFRAME. UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR 62% OF

THE COMPANY'S PERSONAL COMPUTER SHIPMENTS IN 2007, UP FROM 54% IN 2006. NET SALES AND UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE PRODUCTS INCREASED 55% AND 51%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006.

THIS GROWTH WAS DUE TO STRONG DEMAND FOR THE MACBOOK, WHICH INCREASED IN EACH OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS, AS WELL AS THE MACBOOK PRO, WHICH INCREASED IN EACH OPERATING SEGMENT EXCEPT JAPAN.

MAC DESKTOP NET SALES AND UNIT SALES INCREASED BY 21% AND 12%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2007 DUE TO STRONGER SALES OF THE IMAC IN EACH OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE MAC DESKTOP NET SALES GROWTH

WAS GREATER THAN THE UNIT SALES GROWTH PRIMARILY DUE TO A SHIFT IN DESKTOP PRODUCT MIX AWAY FROM THE LOWER-PRICE MAC MINI AND DISCONTINUED EMAC AND TOWARD THE IMAC.



NET

SALES OF IPODS INCREASED $629 MILLION OR 8% DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. UNIT SALES OF IPODS INCREASED 31% COMPARED TO 2006. THE IPOD GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN

BY INCREASED SALES OF THE IPOD SHUFFLE AND IPOD NANO PARTICULARLY IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. IPOD UNIT SALES GROWTH WAS SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER THAN IPOD NET SALES DUE TO A SHIFT IN OVERALL IPOD PRODUCT

MIX, AS WELL AS DUE TO LOWER SELLING PRICES FOR THE IPOD CLASSIC, IPOD NANO AND IPOD SHUFFLE IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006.



NET

SALES OF IPHONE AND RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WERE $123 MILLION IN 2007. IPHONE NET SALES INCLUDE THE PORTION OF IPHONE HANDSET REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING OVER THE PRODUCT'S 24-MONTH ESTIMATED ECONOMIC LIFE, AS WELL AS SALES OF IPHONE ACCESSORY PRODUCTS AND REVENUE FROM CARRIER AGREEMENTS. IPHONE UNIT

SALES WERE 1.39 MILLION IN 2007.



NET

SALES OF OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCREASED $611 MILLION OR 32% DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 DUE TO INCREASED NET SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS GROWTH WAS THE RESULT OF HEIGHTENED CONSUMER INTEREST IN DOWNLOADING DIGITAL CONTENT AND THE EXPANSION OF THIRD-PARTY AUDIO AND VIDEO CONTENT AVAILABLE FOR SALE VIA THE

ITUNES STORE.



NET

SALES OF PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE INCREASED $160 MILLION OR 15% COMPARED TO 2006 DUE TO AN INCREASE IN WIRELESS NETWORKING PRODUCTS AND OTHER HARDWARE

ACCESSORIES, INCLUDING PRINTERS AND SCANNERS, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN NET SALES OF DISPLAYS.



NET

SALES OF SOFTWARE, SERVICE, AND OTHER SALES ROSE $229 MILLION OR 18% DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. THIS GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED NET SALES

OF APPLECARE PROTECTION PLAN ("APP") EXTENDED SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS AND INCREASED SALES OF APPLE BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS' SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.

FISCAL YEAR 2006 VERSUS 2005

NET SALES DURING 2006 INCREASED 39% OR $5.4 BILLION FROM 2005. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE IN PART TO THE FACT THAT 2006 SPANNED 53 WEEKS WHILE 2005 SPANNED 52 WEEKS. SEVERAL

OTHER FACTORS CONTRIBUTED TO THESE INCREASES INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



NET

SALES OF IPODS INCREASED $3.1 BILLION OR 69% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. UNIT SALES OF IPODS TOTALED 39.4 MILLION IN 2006, WHICH REPRESENTS AN INCREASE

OF 75% FROM THE 22.5 MILLION IPOD UNITS SOLD IN 2005. STRONG IPOD SALES DURING 2006 REFLECTED SIGNIFICANT SALES OF BOTH THE HARD-DRIVE BASED IPOD THAT SUPPORTS VIDEO, FIRST

INTRODUCED IN OCTOBER OF 2005 AND THE IPOD NANO, INTRODUCED IN SEPTEMBER 2005, AS WELL AS CONTINUED EXPANSION OF IPOD DISTRIBUTION POINTS. DURING 2006, THE NET

43

SALES

PER IPOD UNIT SOLD DECREASED BY 3% COMPARED TO 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN OVERALL DECREASE IN AVERAGE SELLING PRICES FOR ALL IPODS AS WELL AS A SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TO THE IPOD NANO.



MAC

NET SALES INCREASED $1.1 BILLION OR 18% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. MAC UNIT SALES INCREASED BY 769,000 UNITS OR 17% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. THESE

INCREASES WERE MAINLY DUE TO STRONG DEMAND FOR THE INTEL-BASED MACBOOK AND MACBOOK PRO SYSTEMS AND REFLECT A SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TO PORTABLE PRODUCTS IN ALL OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS. NET

SALES AND UNIT SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE PRODUCTS INCREASED 43% AND 42%, RESPECTIVELY, DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. MAC DESKTOP NET SALES AND UNIT SALES BOTH DECREASED BY 3% DURING 2006

COMPARED TO 2005. THE DECREASE IN SALES OF THE COMPANY'S MAC DESKTOPS WAS DUE TO DECLINES IN SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PROFESSIONAL-ORIENTED DESKTOP PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE DECLINE IN THE

COMPANY'S PROFESSIONAL-ORIENTED DESKTOP PRODUCTS WAS DUE TO CUSTOMERS DELAYING PURCHASES OF SUCH PRODUCTS IN ANTICIPATION OF THE RELEASE OF THE INTEL-BASED MAC PRO, WHICH DID NOT BEGIN SHIPPING UNTIL

AUGUST 2006, AND UPDATED SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS CAPABLE OF RUNNING ON INTEL-BASED MAC COMPUTERS, AND THE TREND

TOWARD PORTABLE COMPUTERS. A SLIGHT INCREASE OF 1% DURING 2006 IN NET SALES PER MAC UNIT SOLD WAS DUE TO A SHIFT IN MIX TO HIGHER-PRICED PORTABLE PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PRICE REDUCTIONS ON

CERTAIN MAC SYSTEMS.



OTHER

MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES CONSISTS OF SALES ASSOCIATED WITH THE ITUNES STORE AND IPOD SERVICES AND ACCESSORIES. NET SALES OF OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES INCREASED $986 MILLION OR 110% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED NET SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE AND APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY IPOD

ACCESSORIES AND SERVICES. THE INCREASE IN SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE STEMMED FROM SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN U.S. SALES AND THE OPENING OF THE ITUNES STORE IN JAPAN DURING AUGUST 2005 AND AUSTRALIA

DURING OCTOBER 2005. THE INCREASED SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE WERE ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AVAILABILITY OF VIDEOS, TELEVISION SHOWS, AND FEATURE-LENGTH MOVIE DOWNLOADS.



NET

SALES OF SOFTWARE, SERVICE, AND OTHER SALES INCREASED $188 MILLION OR 17% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. THE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED NET

SALES OF APPLECARE PROTECTION PLAN ("APP") EXTENDED SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN SALES OF MAC OS X. MAC OS X SALES WERE PARTICULARLY HIGH

IN 2005 DUE TO THE RELEASE OF MAC OS X TIGER IN APRIL 2005.

OFFSETTING

THE FAVORABLE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE COMPANY'S NET SALES DURING 2006 WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE FOLLOWING.



NET

SALES OF PERIPHERALS AND OTHER HARDWARE DECLINED $26 MILLION OR 2% COMPARED TO 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO PRICE DECREASES AND A DECREASE IN NET SALES OF DISPLAYS

RELATING TO A SHIFT IN MIX FROM DESKTOP TO PORTABLE SYSTEMS. THE DECREASE IN NET SALES OF DISPLAYS FOR 2006 IS CONSISTENT WITH THE OVERALL DECREASE IN UNIT SALES OF MAC PROFESSIONAL DESKTOP SYSTEMS.

SEGMENT OPERATING PERFORMANCE

THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS CONSIST OF THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND RETAIL. THE AMERICAS,

EUROPE, AND JAPAN REPORTABLE SEGMENTS DO NOT INCLUDE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCLUDES BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA. THE EUROPE SEGMENT INCLUDES EUROPEAN

COUNTRIES AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. THE RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATES APPLE-OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S., CANADA, JAPAN, THE U.K. AND ITALY. EACH REPORTABLE GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT AND

THE RETAIL OPERATING SEGMENT PROVIDE SIMILAR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SIMILAR SERVICES. DURING 2007, THE COMPANY REVISED THE WAY IT MEASURES THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S OPERATING RESULTS TO A

MANNER THAT IS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS. PRIOR PERIOD RESULTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO REFLECT THIS CHANGE TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S OPERATING RESULTS ALONG WITH

THE CORRESPONDING OFFSETS TO THE OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS. FURTHER INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENTS MAY BE FOUND IN NOTE 9,

44

"SEGMENT

INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA" IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THIS FORM 10-K.

AMERICAS

DURING 2007, NET SALES IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCREASED $2.2 BILLION, OR 23%, COMPARED TO 2006. THE MAIN SOURCES OF THIS GROWTH WERE MAC PORTABLE PRODUCTS, IMACS,

IPODS, AND THE SALES OF THIRD-PARTY CONTENT FROM THE ITUNES STORE. SALES OF MAC PORTABLE PRODUCTS INCREASED DUE TO THE POPULARITY OF THE MACBOOK, INTRODUCED IN MAY 2006 AND UPDATED IN

MAY 2007, AS WELL AS THE MACBOOK PRO, INTRODUCED IN JANUARY 2006 AND UPDATED IN JUNE 2007. SALES OF IMACS GREW DUE TO A SHIFT IN DESKTOP PRODUCT MIX AWAY FROM THE MAC MINI AND

DISCONTINUED EMAC AS WELL AS THE STRONG RECEPTION OF THE NEW IMAC INTRODUCED IN AUGUST 2007. SALES OF IPODS GREW DUE TO INCREASED DEMAND FOR THE IPOD NANO AND IPOD SHUFFLE AND THE INTRODUCTION

OF THE IPOD TOUCH IN SEPTEMBER 2007. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE GROWTH IN ITUNES STORE SALES WAS THE RESULT OF HEIGHTENED CONSUMER INTEREST IN DOWNLOADING DIGITAL CONTENT AND THE EXPANSION

OF THIRD-PARTY AUDIO AND VIDEO CONTENT AVAILABLE FOR SALE VIA THE ITUNES STORE. DURING 2007, THE AMERICAS SEGMENT REPRESENTED 48% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL NET SALES AS COMPARED TO 49% IN THE SAME PERIOD

OF 2006. DURING 2007, U.S. EDUCATION CHANNEL NET SALES AND MAC UNIT SALES INCREASED BY 14% AND 18%, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO 2006. NET SALES FROM THE HIGHER EDUCATION MARKET GREW 17% DURING 2007

COMPARED TO 2006, WHILE NET SALES IN THE K-12 MARKET GREW 10% DURING THE SAME PERIOD.

DURING

2006, NET SALES IN THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCREASED $2.8 BILLION, OR 41%, COMPARED TO 2005. THE PRIMARY CONTRIBUTORS TO THIS INCREASE WERE IPODS, OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

MAC PORTABLE SYSTEMS, AND APP. SALES OF IPODS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE UPDATED IPOD WITH VIDEO-PLAYING CAPABILITIES IN OCTOBER 2005 (NOW REFERRED TO AS IPOD CLASSIC)

AND THE IPOD NANO DURING SEPTEMBER 2005. THE INCREASE IN OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WAS DUE TO INCREASES IN SALES OF APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY IPOD ACCESSORIES AND SALES FROM

THE ITUNES STORE. THE

INCREASE IN SALES OF MAC PORTABLE SYSTEMS IN THE AMERICAS WAS DUE TO STRONG SALES OF THE MACBOOK AND MACBOOK PRO DURING 2006. THE OVERALL INCREASE IN NET SALES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN NET

SALES OF DESKTOPS, DISPLAYS, AND MAC OS X. THE DECREASE IN DESKTOP PRODUCTS AND DISPLAYS NET SALES REFLECTS THE OVERALL SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TOWARD PORTABLE MAC SYSTEMS. MAC OS X SALES DECREASED FROM

2005 SINCE THE COMPANY HAD NOT RELEASED A NEW VERSION OF MAC OS X SINCE TIGER BEGAN SHIPPING IN APRIL 2005. DURING 2006, THE AMERICAS SEGMENT REPRESENTED 49% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL NET SALES AS

COMPARED TO 48% IN THE SAME PERIOD OF 2005.

EUROPE

EUROPE SEGMENT NET SALES INCREASED $1.4 BILLION OR 33% DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. CONSISTENT WITH THE AMERICAS SEGMENT, THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THIS GROWTH WERE MAC

PORTABLE PRODUCTS, IMACS, IPODS, AND THE SALES OF THIRD-PARTY CONTENT FROM THE ITUNES STORE. SALES OF MAC PORTABLE PRODUCTS INCREASED DUE TO THE POPULARITY OF BOTH THE MACBOOK AND MACBOOK PRO. SALES

OF IMACS GREW DUE TO A SHIFT IN DESKTOP PRODUCT MIX AWAY FROM THE MAC MINI AND DISCONTINUED EMAC AS WELL AS THE STRONG RECEPTION OF THE NEW IMAC INTRODUCED IN AUGUST 2007. SALES OF IPODS GREW

PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED DEMAND FOR THE IPOD NANO AND IPOD SHUFFLE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE GROWTH IN ITUNES STORE SALES WAS THE RESULT OF HEIGHTENED CONSUMER INTEREST IN DOWNLOADING DIGITAL

CONTENT AND THE EXPANSION OF THIRD-PARTY AUDIO AND VIDEO CONTENT AVAILABLE FOR SALE VIA THE ITUNES STORE.

EUROPE

SEGMENT NET SALES INCREASED $1.0 BILLION OR 33% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. CONSISTENT WITH THE AMERICAS SEGMENT, THESE INCREASES WERE A RESULT OF STRONG GROWTH IN IPOD SALES, OTHER

MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND MAC PORTABLE SYSTEMS. SALES OF IPODS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE UPDATED IPOD WITH VIDEO-PLAYING CAPABILITIES IN OCTOBER 2005 AND

THE IPOD NANO DURING SEPTEMBER 2005. THE INCREASE IN OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WAS DUE TO INCREASES IN SALES OF APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY IPOD ACCESSORIES AND SALES FROM THE

ITUNES STORE. THE INCREASE IN SALES OF PORTABLE SYSTEMS IN EUROPE WAS DUE TO STRONG SALES OF THE MACBOOK AND MACBOOK PRO THAT WERE INTRODUCED DURING 2006. IN ADDITION, EUROPE ALSO REPORTED INCREASED

SALES IN APP RELATED TO THE INCREASE IN MAC UNIT SALES. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN DESKTOP AND MAC OS X NET SALES

45

DURING

2006 COMPARED TO 2005. THE DECREASE IN DESKTOP NET SALES WAS DUE TO THE SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX TOWARD PORTABLE MAC SYSTEMS. MAC OS X SALES HAVE DECREASED FROM 2005 SINCE THE COMPANY HAS NOT

RELEASED A NEW VERSION OF MAC OS X SINCE TIGER BEGAN SHIPPING IN APRIL 2005.

JAPAN

JAPAN'S NET SALES DECLINED BY $129 MILLION OR 11% IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. TOTAL MAC UNIT SALES IN JAPAN DECLINED 1% DURING 2007. THE DECREASE IN THE JAPAN SEGMENT'S

OVERALL NET SALES WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECREASES IN IPOD AND MAC DESKTOP SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN REVENUE FROM MACBOOKS AND SALES OF THIRD-PARTY CONTENT FROM THE ITUNES

STORE. THE DECLINE IN NET SALES AND MAC UNIT SALES IS PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO JAPAN'S DECLINING CONSUMER PC MARKET, AND THE IPOD SALES DECLINE

IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE SELLING PRICES. THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO EVALUATE WAYS TO IMPROVE THE FUTURE RESULTS OF ITS JAPAN SEGMENT.

JAPAN'S

NET SALES INCREASED $287 MILLION OR 31% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. THE JAPAN SEGMENT EXPERIENCED INCREASED NET SALES IN IPODS, MAC PORTABLE PRODUCTS, AND OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES. CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S OTHER SEGMENTS, JAPAN EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN SALES OF IPODS DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE IPOD WITH VIDEO-PLAYING CAPABILITIES (NOW REFERRED TO AS THE

IPOD CLASSIC) AND THE IPOD NANO IN OCTOBER AND SEPTEMBER OF 2005, RESPECTIVELY. JAPAN ALSO EXPERIENCED STRONG SALES OF THE INTEL-BASED MACBOOK AND INCREASED SALES FROM THE ITUNES STORE. THESE

INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN NET SALES OF MAC DESKTOP PRODUCTS, DISPLAYS, AND MAC OS X. THE DECREASES IN DESKTOP PRODUCTS AND DISPLAYS REFLECT THE OVERALL SHIFT IN PRODUCT MIX

TOWARD PORTABLE MAC SYSTEMS. MAC OS X SALES HAVE DECREASED FROM 2005 SINCE THE COMPANY HAD NOT RELEASED A NEW VERSION OF MAC OS X SINCE TIGER BEGAN SHIPPING IN APRIL 2005. TOTAL MAC UNIT SALES

DURING 2006 REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT COMPARED TO 2005.

RETAIL

THE COMPANY OPENED 32 NEW RETAIL STORES DURING 2007, INCLUDING A TOTAL OF 5 INTERNATIONAL STORES IN THE U.K. AND ITALY, BRINGING THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OPEN STORES TO 197 AS OF

SEPTEMBER 29, 2007. THIS COMPARES TO 165 OPEN STORES AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND 124 OPEN STORES AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2005.

THE

RETAIL SEGMENT'S NET SALES INCREASED BY 27% TO $4.1 BILLION DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. RETAIL SEGMENT MAC UNIT SALES INCREASED 56% DURING 2007 AS COMPARED TO 2006. WITH AN AVERAGE OF 178

STORES OPEN DURING 2007, AVERAGE REVENUE PER STORE WAS $23.1 MILLION, COMPARED TO $22.9 MILLION IN 2006 AND $21.7 MILLION IN 2005. THE CURRENT YEAR INCREASE IN RETAIL SEGMENT NET

SALES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONGER SALES OF MAC PORTABLE PRODUCTS, IMACS, ACCESSORIES AND SERVICES. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET PRIMARILY BY LOWER NET SALES OF IPODS AND OTHER MUSIC RELATED

PRODUCTS DUE TO THE EXPANDED AVAILABILITY OF THOSE PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY RESELLERS.

THE

RETAIL SEGMENT'S NET SALES INCREASED BY 42% TO $3.3 BILLION DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. RETAIL SEGMENT MAC UNIT SALES INCREASED 45% DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. THE CURRENT YEAR INCREASE

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG SALES OF MAC PORTABLE AND DESKTOP PRODUCTS, IPODS, AND OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. SALES OF IPODS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF THE UPDATED

IPOD WITH VIDEO-PLAYING CAPABILITIES IN OCTOBER 2005 AND THE IPOD NANO DURING SEPTEMBER 2005. THE INCREASE IN OTHER MUSIC RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WAS DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF

APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY IPOD ACCESSORIES. MAC PORTABLE AND DESKTOP SALES INCREASED DUE TO STRONG SALES OF THE INTEL-BASED MACBOOK, MACBOOK PRO, AND IMAC.

AS

MEASURED BY THE COMPANY'S OPERATING SEGMENT REPORTING, THE RETAIL SEGMENT REPORTED OPERATING INCOME OF $875 MILLION DURING 2007 AS COMPARED TO OPERATING INCOME OF $600 MILLION AND

$396 MILLION DURING 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THIS IMPROVEMENT IN 2007 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AN INCREASE IN THE COMPANY'S OVERALL GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE.

EXPANSION

OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN FIXED ASSETS AND RELATED INFRASTRUCTURE, OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS, PERSONNEL, AND OTHER

OPERATING EXPENSES.

46

CAPITAL

ASSET PURCHASES ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETAIL SEGMENT WERE $294 MILLION IN 2007, BRINGING THE TOTAL CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES SINCE INCEPTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT TO $1.0 BILLION. AS

OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE RETAIL SEGMENT HAD APPROXIMATELY 7,900 EMPLOYEES AND HAD OUTSTANDING OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH RETAIL STORE SPACE AND RELATED FACILITIES OF

$1.1 BILLION. THE COMPANY WOULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS IF IT WERE TO CLOSE MULTIPLE RETAIL STORES. SUCH COSTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

OTHER SEGMENTS

THE COMPANY'S OTHER SEGMENTS, WHICH CONSISTS OF ITS ASIA PACIFIC AND FILEMAKER OPERATIONS, EXPERIENCED AN INCREASE IN NET SALES OF $406 MILLION, OR 30% DURING 2007

COMPARED TO 2006. THIS INCREASE RELATED PRIMARILY TO A 58% INCREASE IN SALES OF MAC PORTABLE PRODUCTS AND STRONG IPOD SALES IN THE COMPANY'S ASIA PACIFIC REGION.

DURING

2006, NET SALES IN OTHER SEGMENTS INCREASED 35% COMPARED TO 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN SALES OF IPOD AND MAC PORTABLE PRODUCTS. STRONG SALES GROWTH WAS A RESULT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF

THE UPDATED IPODS FEATURING VIDEO-PLAYING CAPABILITIES AND THE NEW INTEL-BASED MAC PORTABLE PRODUCTS THAT TRANSLATED TO A 16% INCREASE IN MAC UNIT SALES DURING 2006 COMPARED TO 2005.

29.0%

GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE OF 34.0% IN 2007 INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 29.0% IN 2006. THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THIS INCREASE WERE MORE FAVORABLE COSTS ON CERTAIN COMMODITY COMPONENTS, INCLUDING NAND

FLASH MEMORY AND DRAM MEMORY, HIGHER OVERALL REVENUE THAT PROVIDED FOR MORE LEVERAGE ON FIXED PRODUCTION COSTS AND A HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE FROM THE COMPANY'S DIRECT SALES CHANNELS.

THE

COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT ITS GROSS MARGIN AND THE GROSS MARGINS OF THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES WILL BE SUBJECT TO PRESSURE DUE TO PRICE

COMPETITION. THE COMPANY EXPECTS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE TO DECLINE SEQUENTIALLY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE FULL-QUARTER IMPACT OF PRODUCT TRANSITIONS AND

REDUCED PRICING THAT WERE EFFECTED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, LOWER SALES OF ILIFE AND IWORK IN THEIR SECOND QUARTER OF AVAILABILITY, SEASONALLY HIGHER COMPONENT COSTS, AND A HIGHER MIX OF

INDIRECT SALES. THESE FACTORS ARE EXPECTED TO BE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SALES OF THE COMPANY'S MAC OS X OPERATING SYSTEM DUE TO THE INTRODUCTION OF MAC OS X VERSION 10.5 LEOPARD ("MAC OS X

LEOPARD") THAT BECAME AVAILABLE IN OCTOBER 2007.

THE

FOREGOING STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANY'S EXPECTED GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE ARE FORWARD-LOOKING. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT CURRENT GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE WILL BE MAINTAINED OR TARGETED

GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE LEVELS WILL BE ACHIEVED. IN GENERAL, GROSS MARGINS AND MARGINS ON INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS WILL REMAIN UNDER DOWNWARD PRESSURE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING CONTINUED

INDUSTRY WIDE GLOBAL PRICING PRESSURES, INCREASED COMPETITION, COMPRESSED PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, POTENTIAL INCREASES IN THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIAL AND OUTSIDE MANUFACTURING SERVICES, AND

A POTENTIAL SHIFT IN THE COMPANY'S SALES MIX TOWARDS PRODUCTS WITH LOWER GROSS MARGINS. IN RESPONSE TO THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, THE COMPANY EXPECTS IT WILL CONTINUE TO TAKE PRICING ACTIONS WITH

RESPECT TO ITS PRODUCTS. GROSS MARGINS COULD ALSO BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO EFFECTIVELY MANAGE PRODUCT QUALITY AND WARRANTY COSTS AND TO STIMULATE

47

DEMAND

FOR CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS. DUE TO THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL RESULTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED IN THE SHORT-TERM BY FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE

RATES.

THE

COMPANY ORDERS COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILDS INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT SHIPMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S MARKETS ARE VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, THERE

IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND PRODUCE OR ORDER FROM THIRD-PARTIES EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF PARTICULAR PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

OPERATING RESULTS IN THE PAST HAVE BEEN AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY LEVELS AND OUTSTANDING PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND TO

RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

GROSS

MARGIN PERCENTAGE OF 29.0% IN 2006 REMAINED FLAT COMPARED TO 2005. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED MORE FAVORABLE PRICING ON CERTAIN COMMODITY COMPONENTS INCLUDING LCD FLAT-PANEL DISPLAYS

AND DRAM MEMORY AND HIGHER OVERALL REVENUE THAT PROVIDED FOR MORE LEVERAGE ON FIXED PRODUCTION COSTS, OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN LOWER MARGIN IPOD SALES AND OTHER MUSIC-RELATED SERVICES.

EXPENDITURES FOR R&D INCREASED 10% OR $70 MILLION TO $782 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. R&D EXPENSE DOES NOT INCLUDE CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF

$75 MILLION RELATED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF MAC OS X LEOPARD AND IPHONE. THE INCREASES IN R&D EXPENSE WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN R&D HEADCOUNT IN THE CURRENT YEAR TO SUPPORT EXPANDED

R&D ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ONE LESS WEEK OF EXPENSES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 AND THE CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS MENTIONED ABOVE. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT FOCUSED

INVESTMENTS IN R&D ARE CRITICAL TO ITS FUTURE GROWTH AND COMPETITIVE POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO TIMELY DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND ENHANCED PRODUCTS THAT ARE CENTRAL TO THE

COMPANY'S CORE BUSINESS STRATEGY. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCREASE SPENDING IN R&D TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE.

SELLING, GENERAL, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE ("SG&A")

EXPENDITURES FOR SG&A INCREASED $530 MILLION OR 22% DURING 2007 COMPARED TO 2006. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER DIRECT AND INDIRECT CHANNEL VARIABLE SELLING

EXPENSES RESULTING FROM THE SIGNIFICANT YEAR-OVER-YEAR INCREASE IN TOTAL NET SALES IN 2007, THE COMPANY'S CONTINUED EXPANSION OF ITS RETAIL SEGMENT IN BOTH DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND A CURRENT YEAR INCREASE IN SPENDING ON MARKETING AND ADVERTISING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ONE LESS WEEK OF EXPENSES IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007.

TOTAL

OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE INCREASED $234 MILLION OR 64% TO $599 MILLION DURING 2007 AS COMPARED TO $365 MILLION AND $165 MILLION IN 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE

INCREASE IN 2007 IS ATTRIBUTABLE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED INTEREST RECEIVED FROM HIGHER CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT BALANCES AND STRONGER INVESTMENT YIELDS RESULTING FROM HIGHER AVERAGE

MARKET INTEREST RATES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ONE LESS WEEK OF INTEREST INCOME EARNED IN 2007. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE EARNED BY THE COMPANY ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS INCREASED TO 5.27% IN 2007 AS COMPARED TO THE 4.58% AND 2.70% RATES EARNED DURING 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE CURRENT YEAR INCREASE IN INTEREST INCOME WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OTHER EXPENSE, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH HIGHER FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING EXPENSES. DURING 2007, 2006 AND 2005, THE COMPANY HAD NO DEBT OUTSTANDING AND ACCORDINGLY

DID NOT INCUR ANY INTEREST EXPENSE.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 WAS 30%. THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE RATE DIFFERS FROM THE STATUTORY FEDERAL INCOME TAX RATE OF 35%

DUE PRIMARILY TO CERTAIN UNDISTRIBUTED FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR WHICH NO U.S. TAXES ARE PROVIDED BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

RECORDED A TAX BENEFIT OF $63 MILLION DUE TO THE SETTLEMENT OF PRIOR YEAR AUDITS IN THE U.S.

AS

OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARISING FROM DEDUCTIBLE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES, TAX LOSSES, AND TAX CREDITS OF $1.1 BILLION BEFORE BEING OFFSET AGAINST

CERTAIN DEFERRED LIABILITIES AND A VALUATION ALLOWANCE FOR PRESENTATION ON THE COMPANY'S BALANCE SHEET. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT FORECASTED INCOME, INCLUDING INCOME THAT MAY

BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN TAX PLANNING STRATEGIES, TOGETHER WITH THE TAX EFFECTS OF THE DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO FULLY RECOVER THE REMAINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 A VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $5 MILLION WAS RECORDED AGAINST THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR THE BENEFITS OF STATE OPERATING LOSSES THAT MAY NOT

BE REALIZED. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE REALIZABILITY OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS QUARTERLY BY ASSESSING THE NEED FOR AND AMOUNT OF THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

THE

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE ("IRS") HAS COMPLETED ITS FIELD AUDIT OF THE COMPANY'S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2002 THROUGH 2003 AND PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

CONTEST CERTAIN OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH THE IRS APPEALS OFFICE. ALL IRS AUDIT ISSUES FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2002 HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE, LOCAL, AND

FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE PREDICTED

WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANY'S TAX AUDITS BE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS PROVISION FOR

INCOME TAX IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ("FASB") ISSUED SFAS NO. 159,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

FINANCIAL LIABILITIES-INCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 115

("SFAS NO. 159"). SFAS NO. 159 ALLOWS COMPANIES TO CHOOSE TO ELECT MEASURING

ELIGIBLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS AT FAIR VALUE THAT ARE NOT REQUIRED TO BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. SFAS

49

NO. 159

REQUIRES THAT UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON ITEMS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED BE REPORTED IN EARNINGS AT EACH REPORTING DATE. SFAS NO. 159 IS EFFECTIVE FOR

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007 AND IS REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE

APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 159, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

IN

SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS,

WHICH DEFINES FAIR VALUE, PROVIDES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING

FAIR VALUE, AND EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. SFAS NO. 157 APPLIES TO OTHER ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT REQUIRE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS; IT DOES NOT REQUIRE

ANY NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. SFAS NO. 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007 AND IS REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER

OF FISCAL 2009. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 157, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S

FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

IN

JUNE 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. ("FIN") 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES-AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT

NO. 109

. FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES BY CREATING A FRAMEWORK FOR HOW COMPANIES SHOULD RECOGNIZE, MEASURE, PRESENT, AND DISCLOSE IN

THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS THAT THEY HAVE TAKEN OR EXPECT TO TAKE IN A TAX RETURN. FIN 48 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2006 AND IS REQUIRED

TO BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE APPLICATION OF FIN 48, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT CURRENTLY BELIEVE ADOPTION

WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

AS

OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD $15.4 BILLION IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AN INCREASE OF $5.3 BILLION OVER THE SAME BALANCE AT THE

END OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. THE PRINCIPAL COMPONENTS OF THIS NET INCREASE WERE CASH GENERATED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF $5.5 BILLION, PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK UNDER

STOCK PLANS OF $365 MILLION AND EXCESS TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION OF $377 MILLION. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS OF PROPERTY, PLANT,

AND EQUIPMENT OF $735 MILLION AND PAYMENTS FOR ACQUISITIONS OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $251 MILLION. THE COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY INVESTED IN

HIGHLY RATED, LIQUID INVESTMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, $6.5 BILLION AND $4.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WERE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ARE GENERALLY BASED IN U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED HOLDINGS.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES ITS EXISTING BALANCES OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY ITS WORKING CAPITAL NEEDS, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, OUTSTANDING

COMMITMENTS, AND OTHER LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS EXISTING OPERATIONS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

CAPITAL ASSETS

THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES WERE $822 MILLION DURING 2007, CONSISTING OF $294 MILLION FOR RETAIL STORE FACILITIES AND $528 MILLION FOR REAL

ESTATE ACQUISITIONS AND CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE INCLUDING INFORMATION SYSTEMS ENHANCEMENTS. OF THE $822 MILLION IN TOTAL CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES DURING 2007, $87 MILLION WERE NOT YET

PAID FOR AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES IT WILL UTILIZE APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION FOR CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES DURING 2008, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY

$400 MILLION FOR EXPANSION OF THE COMPANY'S RETAIL SEGMENT, AND APPROXIMATELY $700 MILLION TO SUPPORT NORMAL REPLACEMENT OF EXISTING CAPITAL ASSETS, INCLUDING MANUFACTURING RELATED

EQUIPMENT, ENHANCEMENTS TO GENERAL INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE, AND REAL ESTATE ACQUISITIONS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENTERED INTO ANY TRANSACTIONS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES WHEREBY THE COMPANY HAS FINANCIAL GUARANTEES, SUBORDINATED RETAINED INTERESTS, DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, OR OTHER CONTINGENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT EXPOSE THE COMPANY TO MATERIAL CONTINUING RISKS, CONTINGENT LIABILITIES, OR ANY OTHER OBLIGATION UNDER A VARIABLE INTEREST IN AN UNCONSOLIDATED

ENTITY THAT PROVIDES FINANCING, LIQUIDITY, MARKET RISK, OR CREDIT RISK SUPPORT TO THE COMPANY.

LEASE COMMITMENTS

AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD TOTAL OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS ON NONCANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES OF $1.4 BILLION, $1.1 BILLION OF WHICH RELATED TO

THE LEASE OF RETAIL SPACE AND RELATED FACILITIES. LEASE TERMS ON THE COMPANY'S EXISTING MAJOR FACILITY OPERATING LEASES GENERALLY RANGE FROM 3 TO 15 YEARS.

PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS

THE COMPANY UTILIZES SEVERAL CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS TO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES FOR THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND TO PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY AND TEST OF FINISHED

PRODUCTS. THESE CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS ACQUIRE COMPONENTS AND BUILD PRODUCT BASED ON DEMAND INFORMATION SUPPLIED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH TYPICALLY COVERS PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. THE

COMPANY ALSO OBTAINS INDIVIDUAL COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF INDIVIDUAL SUPPLIERS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY ACQUIRES COMPONENTS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF

PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANY'S FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS

FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS AN OFF-BALANCE SHEET WARRANTY OBLIGATION FOR PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING PURSUANT TO

SOP NO. 97-2 WHEREBY THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES WARRANTY EXPENSE AS INCURRED. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING OFF-BALANCE SHEET THIRD-PARTY

MANUFACTURING COMMITMENTS, COMPONENT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, AND WARRANTY COMMITMENTS OF $3.2 BILLION.

DURING

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS WITH HYNIX SEMICONDUCTOR, INC., INTEL CORPORATION, MICRON TECHNOLOGY, INC., SAMSUNG

ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION TO SECURE SUPPLY OF NAND FLASH MEMORY THROUGH CALENDAR YEAR 2010. AS PART OF THESE

51

AGREEMENTS,

THE COMPANY PREPAID $1.25 BILLION FOR FLASH MEMORY COMPONENTS DURING 2006, WHICH WILL BE APPLIED TO CERTAIN INVENTORY PURCHASES MADE OVER THE LIFE OF EACH RESPECTIVE AGREEMENT. THE

COMPANY UTILIZED $208 MILLION OF THE PREPAYMENT AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY'S ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH COMMITMENTS TO RETURN PROPERTY SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASES TO ORIGINAL CONDITION UPON LEASE TERMINATION. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THAT GROSS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF $24 MILLION WOULD BE REQUIRED TO FULFILL THESE OBLIGATIONS.

OTHER OBLIGATIONS

OTHER OUTSTANDING OBLIGATIONS WERE $50 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INTERNET AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES AND THE ESTIMATED COST

RELATED TO THE $100 STORE CREDIT THE COMPANY OFFERED TO CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASED AN IPHONE PRIOR TO THE COMPANY'S SEPTEMBER 2007 PRICE REDUCTION.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF

AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED

AGAINST ITSELF OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY AND, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, DOES NOT HAVE A LIABILITY RELATED TO UNRESOLVED INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION THAT WOULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS, BOTH ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS AND IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS UNDERLYING FOREIGN CURRENCY AND

INTEREST RATE RELATED EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE EFFECTIVE HORIZONS OF THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE ANTICIPATORY NATURE OF THE EXPOSURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE HEDGES

WILL OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL IMPACT RESULTING FROM MOVEMENTS IN EITHER FOREIGN EXCHANGE OR INTEREST RATES. IN ADDITION, THE TIMING OF THE ACCOUNTING FOR RECOGNITION OF GAINS AND

LOSSES RELATED TO MARK-TO-MARKET INSTRUMENTS FOR ANY GIVEN PERIOD MAY NOT COINCIDE WITH THE TIMING OF GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING ECONOMIC EXPOSURES AND,

THEREFORE, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

INTEREST RATE RISK

WHILE THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS IN MANY OF THE WORLD'S LEADING INDUSTRIALIZED COUNTRIES, THE COMPANY'S INTEREST INCOME AND EXPENSE IS MOST SENSITIVE

TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE GENERAL

LEVEL OF U.S. INTEREST RATES. AS SUCH, CHANGES IN U.S. INTEREST RATES AFFECT THE INTEREST EARNED ON THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, THE VALUE OF THOSE

INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES.

THE

COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT POLICY AND STRATEGY IS TO ENSURE THE PRESERVATION OF CAPITAL, MEET LIQUIDITY REQUIREMENTS, AND OPTIMIZE RETURN IN LIGHT OF THE CURRENT CREDIT AND

INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S CASH IS MANAGED BY EXTERNAL MANAGERS WITHIN THE GUIDELINES OF THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT POLICY AND TO AN OBJECTIVE MARKET BENCHMARK. THE COMPANY'S

INTERNAL PORTFOLIO IS BENCHMARKED AGAINST EXTERNAL MANAGER PERFORMANCE, ALLOWING FOR DIFFERENCES IN LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

THE

COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO MARKET RISK FOR CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES RELATES PRIMARILY TO THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY PLACES ITS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS IN HIGHLY LIQUID

SECURITIES ISSUED BY HIGHLY RATED ISSUERS AND, BY POLICY, LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF CREDIT EXPOSURE TO ANY ONE ISSUER. THE COMPANY'S

52

GENERAL

POLICY IS TO LIMIT THE RISK OF PRINCIPAL LOSS AND ENSURE THE SAFETY OF INVESTED FUNDS BY LIMITING MARKET AND CREDIT RISK. ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH INITIAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS

OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS; HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH INITIAL MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, $1.9 BILLION OF THE COMPANY'S SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES RANGING FROM 1 TO 5 YEARS.

THE REMAINDER ALL HAD UNDERLYING MATURITIES OF LESS THAN 12 MONTHS. THE COMPANY MAY SELL ITS INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO THEIR STATED MATURITIES FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, IN ANTICIPATION OF CREDIT

DETERIORATION, OR FOR DURATION MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET GAINS BEFORE TAXES ON SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $474,000 IN 2007 AND NET LOSSES BEFORE TAXES OF

APPROXIMATELY $434,000 AND $137,000 IN 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

TO

PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE INTEREST RATE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT A CHANGE IN

INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE ON THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ASSUMING A 100 BASIS POINT PARALLEL SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE. BASED ON INVESTMENT POSITIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, A

HYPOTHETICAL 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES ACROSS ALL MATURITIES WOULD RESULT IN $16 MILLION INCREMENTAL DECLINE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, A SIMILAR 100 BASIS POINT SHIFT IN THE YIELD CURVE WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN A $15 MILLION INCREMENTAL DECLINE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO. SUCH LOSSES

WOULD ONLY BE REALIZED IF THE COMPANY SOLD THE INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO MATURITY.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK

IN GENERAL, THE COMPANY IS A NET RECEIVER OF CURRENCIES OTHER THAN THE U.S. DOLLAR. ACCORDINGLY, CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES, AND IN PARTICULAR A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S.

DOLLAR, MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE

COMPANY'S NET SALES AND GROSS MARGINS AS EXPRESSED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THERE IS ALSO A RISK THAT THE COMPANY WILL HAVE TO ADJUST LOCAL CURRENCY PRODUCT PRICING DUE TO COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WHEN THERE HAS

BEEN SIGNIFICANT VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE

COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN

FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY'S PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY OF ITS MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE

EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE NOT TO HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES DUE TO IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES, AND/OR LIMITED AVAILABILITY

OF APPROPRIATE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

TO

PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE POSITIONS, THE COMPANY PERFORMED A SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS USING A

VALUE-AT-RISK ("VAR") MODEL TO ASSESS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES. THE VAR MODEL CONSISTED OF USING A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TO GENERATE 3,000 RANDOM

MARKET PRICE PATHS. THE VAR IS THE MAXIMUM EXPECTED LOSS IN FAIR VALUE, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE INTERVAL, TO THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MOVEMENTS IN RATES. THE VAR MODEL IS

NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE MODEL ASSUMES NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL. BASED ON THE RESULTS OF THE MODEL, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES WITH 95% CONFIDENCE A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR

VALUE OF $12.8 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 COMPARED TO A MAXIMUM ONE-DAY LOSS OF $9.2 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. BECAUSE THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN

CURRENCY INSTRUMENTS FOR HEDGING PURPOSES, LOSSES INCURRED ON THOSE INSTRUMENTS ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES.

ACTUAL

FUTURE GAINS AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND DERIVATIVE POSITIONS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE SENSITIVITY ANALYSES PERFORMED AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007

DUE TO THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH PREDICTING THE CHANGES IN THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGES RATES, AND THE COMPANY'S ACTUAL EXPOSURES AND POSITIONS.

AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION DEVICES AND SELLS A VARIETY OF RELATED SOFTWARE, SERVICES, PERIPHERALS, AND NETWORKING SOLUTIONS. THE COMPANY SELLS ITS PRODUCTS WORLDWIDE THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES, ITS

RETAIL STORES, ITS DIRECT SALES FORCE, AND THIRD-PARTY WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY SELLS A VARIETY OF THIRD-PARTY MAC, IPOD AND IPHONE COMPATIBLE

PRODUCTS INCLUDING APPLICATION SOFTWARE, PRINTERS, STORAGE DEVICES, SPEAKERS, HEADPHONES, AND VARIOUS OTHER ACCESSORIES AND SUPPLIES THROUGH ITS ONLINE AND RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANY SELLS TO

BASIS OF PRESENTATION AND PREPARATION

THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE COMPANY. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. THE PREPARATION OF THESE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THESE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE ESTIMATES. CERTAIN PRIOR YEAR AMOUNTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES

THERETO HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

THE

COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR IS THE 52 OR 53-WEEK PERIOD THAT ENDS ON THE LAST SATURDAY OF SEPTEMBER. THE COMPANY'S FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2007 CONTAINED 13 WEEKS AND THE FIRST QUARTER

OF FISCAL YEAR 2006 CONTAINED 14 WEEKS. THE COMPANY'S FISCAL YEAR 2007 ENDED ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND INCLUDED 52 WEEKS, WHILE FISCAL YEAR 2006 INCLUDED 53 WEEKS AND FISCAL YEAR 2005 INCLUDED

52 WEEKS. UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, REFERENCES TO PARTICULAR YEARS OR QUARTERS REFER TO THE COMPANY'S FISCAL YEARS ENDED IN SEPTEMBER AND THE ASSOCIATED QUARTERS OF THOSE FISCAL YEARS.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS CASH EQUIVALENTS. HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES

GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THE COMPANY'S DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES HAVE BEEN CLASSIFIED AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE CLASSIFICATION OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE AND REEVALUATES THE

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DESIGNATIONS AS OF EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE. THESE SECURITIES ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH THE UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES, NET OF TAXES, REPORTED AS A

COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. THE COST OF SECURITIES SOLD IS BASED UPON THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND CARRIES THEM AT FAIR VALUE. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DEFINED AS HEDGES IN STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ("SFAS") NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

AS AMENDED, MUST BE ADJUSTED TO

FAIR VALUE THROUGH EARNINGS.

FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABILITY IN EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT IS REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION

AFFECTS

59

EARNINGS.

THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IS RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. TO RECEIVE HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE

IN OFFSETTING CHANGES TO EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT HEDGE THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF AN ASSET OR A LIABILITY AND THAT ARE

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING GAIN OR LOSS ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS

IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. THE NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT THAT IS DESIGNATED AS AN ECONOMIC HEDGE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EXPOSURE OF THE NET

INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION IS REPORTED IN THE SAME MANNER AS A FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT. FOR FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, THE COMPANY EXCLUDES CHANGES

IN FAIR VALUE RELATING TO CHANGES IN THE FORWARD CARRY COMPONENT FROM ITS DEFINITION OF EFFECTIVENESS. ACCORDINGLY, ANY GAINS OR LOSSES RELATED TO THIS COMPONENT ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, COMPUTED USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD, OR MARKET. IF THE COST OF THE INVENTORIES EXCEEDS THEIR

MARKET VALUE, PROVISIONS ARE MADE CURRENTLY FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COST AND THE MARKET VALUE. THE COMPANY'S INVENTORIES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FINISHED GOODS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT ARE STATED AT COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED BY USE OF THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH

FOR BUILDINGS IS THE LESSER OF 30 YEARS OR THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING BUILDING, UP TO 5 YEARS FOR EQUIPMENT, AND THE SHORTER OF LEASE TERMS OR 10 YEARS FOR LEASEHOLD

IMPROVEMENTS. THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES ELIGIBLE COSTS TO ACQUIRE OR DEVELOP INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE THAT ARE INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE. CAPITALIZED COSTS RELATED TO

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS, WHICH RANGE FROM 3 TO 5 YEARS. DEPRECIATION AND

AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ON PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WAS $249 MILLION, $180 MILLION, AND $141 MILLION DURING 2007, 2006, AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY RECORDS OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT COSTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS

NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

. THE COMPANY REVIEWS LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS THAT RESULT FROM THE ACQUISITION, CONSTRUCTION, DEVELOPMENT AND/OR NORMAL USE OF THE ASSETS. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT A LEGAL OBLIGATION EXISTS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT IS INCURRED IF A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE CAN BE MADE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LIABILITY IS ADDED TO THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE ASSOCIATED ASSET AND THIS ADDITIONAL CARRYING AMOUNT IS DEPRECIATED OVER THE LIFE OF THE ASSET. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GROSS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOW AND ITS PRESENT VALUE

IS ACCRETED OVER THE LIFE OF THE RELATED LEASE AS AN OPERATING EXPENSE. ALL OF THE COMPANY'S EXISTING ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH COMMITMENTS TO RETURN PROPERTY SUBJECT TO

OPERATING LEASES TO ORIGINAL CONDITION UPON LEASE TERMINATION. THE COMPANY'S ASSET RETIREMENT LIABILITY WAS $18 MILLION AND $15 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND

SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDING GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY REVIEWS PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES, EXCLUDING GOODWILL, FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED

60

ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. RECOVERABILITY OF THESE ASSETS IS MEASURED BY COMPARISON OF ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO FUTURE UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THE ASSETS ARE EXPECTED TO

GENERATE. IF PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AND CERTAIN IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE RECOGNIZED EQUALS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD ANY MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS DURING 2007, 2006, AND 2005.

SFAS

NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE USEFUL LIVES SHOULD NOT BE

AMORTIZED BUT RATHER BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY OR SOONER WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THEY MAY BE IMPAIRED. THE COMPANY PERFORMS ITS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

TESTS ON OR ABOUT AUGUST 31 OF EACH YEAR. THE COMPANY DID NOT RECOGNIZE ANY GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2007, 2006, OR 2005. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED REPORTING UNITS BASED

ON ITS CURRENT REPORTING STRUCTURE. FOR PURPOSES OF TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT, GOODWILL HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THESE REPORTING UNITS TO THE EXTENT IT RELATES TO EACH REPORTING UNIT.

SFAS

NO. 142 ALSO REQUIRES THAT INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES BE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AND REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144. THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY AMORTIZING ITS ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH DEFINITE LIVES OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM 2 TO 10 YEARS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

THE COMPANY TRANSLATES THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF ITS INTERNATIONAL NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY SUBSIDIARIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS USING EXCHANGE RATES IN

EFFECT AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD. REVENUE AND EXPENSES FOR THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE TRANSLATED USING RATES THAT APPROXIMATE THOSE IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSLATIONS

ARE CREDITED OR CHARGED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCLUDED IN "ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME" IN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN MANUFACTURING SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN OTHER

INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES THAT USE THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY REMEASURE MONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD, AND INVENTORIES,

PROPERTY, AND NONMONETARY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT HISTORICAL RATES. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM THESE TRANSLATIONS WERE INSIGNIFICANT AND HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

NET SALES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF REVENUE FROM THE SALE OF HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, MUSIC PRODUCTS, DIGITAL CONTENT, PERIPHERALS, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. FOR ANY PRODUCT

WITHIN THESE GROUPS THAT EITHER IS SOFTWARE, OR IS CONSIDERED SOFTWARE-RELATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE GUIDANCE IN EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ("EITF") NO. 03-5,

COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTION IS PROBABLE. PRODUCT IS CONSIDERED

DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER ONCE IT HAS BEEN SHIPPED AND TITLE AND RISK OF LOSS HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED. FOR

61

MOST

OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT SALES, THESE CRITERIA ARE MET AT THE TIME THE PRODUCT IS SHIPPED. FOR ONLINE SALES TO INDIVIDUALS, FOR SOME SALES TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS IN THE U.S., AND FOR CERTAIN

OTHER SALES, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES THE PRODUCT BECAUSE THE COMPANY LEGALLY RETAINS A PORTION OF THE RISK OF LOSS ON THESE SALES DURING TRANSIT. IF AT THE OUTSET OF AN

ARRANGEMENT THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS NOT, OR IS PRESUMED NOT TO BE, FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, REVENUE IS DEFERRED AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED AS AMOUNTS BECOME DUE AND PAYABLE.

REVENUE

FROM SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE COVERAGE PERIODS. THESE CONTRACTS TYPICALLY INCLUDE EXTENDED PHONE SUPPORT, REPAIR SERVICES,

WEB-BASED SUPPORT RESOURCES, DIAGNOSTIC TOOLS, AND EXTEND THE SERVICE COVERAGE OFFERED UNDER THE COMPANY'S ONE-YEAR LIMITED WARRANTY.

THE

COMPANY SELLS SOFTWARE AND PERIPHERAL PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OTHER COMPANIES. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHES ITS OWN PRICING AND RETAINS RELATED INVENTORY RISK, IS THE PRIMARY OBLIGOR IN SALES

TRANSACTIONS WITH ITS CUSTOMERS, AND ASSUMES THE CREDIT RISK FOR AMOUNTS BILLED TO ITS CUSTOMERS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR THE SALE OF PRODUCTS OBTAINED FROM OTHER COMPANIES

BASED ON THE GROSS AMOUNT BILLED.

THE

COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT CONSIST ONLY OF SOFTWARE OR SOFTWARE-RELATED PRODUCTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOP NO. 97-2. IF A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT

INCLUDES DELIVERABLES THAT ARE NEITHER SOFTWARE NOR SOFTWARE-RELATED, THE COMPANY APPLIES EITF NO. 00-21,

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE

DELIVERABLES,

TO DETERMINE IF THOSE DELIVERABLES CONSTITUTE SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING FROM THE SOP NO. 97-2 DELIVERABLES. IF THE COMPANY CAN SEPARATE THE

DELIVERABLES, THE COMPANY APPLIES SOP NO. 97-2 TO THE SOFTWARE AND SOFTWARE-RELATED DELIVERABLES AND APPLIES OTHER APPROPRIATE GUIDANCE (E.G., SAB NO. 104) TO THE

DELIVERABLES OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF SOP NO. 97-2. REVENUE ON ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS SUCH AS HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND SERVICES IS ALLOCATED TO EACH ELEMENT BASED ON

THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE OF EACH ELEMENT. EACH ELEMENT'S ALLOCATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA FOR THAT ELEMENT HAVE BEEN MET. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED BY

VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE ("VSOE"), WHICH IS BASED ON THE PRICE CHARGED WHEN EACH ELEMENT IS SOLD SEPARATELY. IF THE COMPANY CANNOT OBJECTIVELY DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY UNDELIVERED

ELEMENT INCLUDED IN A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE UNTIL ALL ELEMENTS ARE DELIVERED AND SERVICES HAVE BEEN PERFORMED, OR UNTIL FAIR VALUE CAN OBJECTIVELY BE DETERMINED FOR

ANY REMAINING UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS. WHEN THE FAIR VALUE OF A DELIVERED ELEMENT HAS NOT BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE COMPANY USES THE RESIDUAL METHOD TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE IF THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL UNDELIVERED

ELEMENTS IS DETERMINABLE. UNDER THE RESIDUAL METHOD, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS DEFERRED AND THE REMAINING PORTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT FEE IS ALLOCATED TO THE DELIVERED ELEMENTS AND

IS RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE.

THE

COMPANY RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR ESTIMATED COMMITMENTS RELATED TO PRICE PROTECTION AND FOR CUSTOMER INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING RESELLER AND END-USER REBATES, AND OTHER

SALES PROGRAMS AND VOLUME-BASED INCENTIVES. THE ESTIMATED COST OF THESE PROGRAMS IS ACCRUED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE IN THE PERIOD THE COMPANY HAS SOLD THE PRODUCT AND COMMITTED TO A PLAN. THE

COMPANY ALSO RECORDS REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR EXPECTED FUTURE PRODUCT RETURNS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE. REVENUE IS RECORDED NET OF TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS THAT ARE REMITTED

TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES, WITH THE COLLECTED TAXES RECORDED AS CURRENT LIABILITIES UNTIL REMITTED TO THE RELEVANT GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY.

GENERALLY,

THE COMPANY DOES NOT OFFER SPECIFIED OR UNSPECIFIED UPGRADE RIGHTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS IN CONNECTION WITH SOFTWARE SALES OR THE SALE OF EXTENDED WARRANTY AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS. WHEN THE

COMPANY DOES OFFER SPECIFIED UPGRADE RIGHTS, THE COMPANY DEFERS REVENUE FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SPECIFIED UPGRADE

62

RIGHT

UNTIL THE FUTURE OBLIGATION IS FULFILLED OR WHEN THE RIGHT TO THE SPECIFIED UPGRADE EXPIRES. ADDITIONALLY, A LIMITED NUMBER OF THE COMPANY'S SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE AVAILABLE WITH MAINTENANCE

AGREEMENTS THAT GRANT CUSTOMERS RIGHTS TO UNSPECIFIED FUTURE UPGRADES OVER THE MAINTENANCE TERM ON A WHEN AND IF AVAILABLE BASIS. REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH MAINTENANCE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER

THE MAINTENANCE TERM.

IN

MARCH 2007, THE COMPANY BEGAN SHIPPING APPLE TV AND IN JUNE 2007 BEGAN SHIPPING IPHONE. FOR APPLE TV AND IPHONE, THE COMPANY INDICATED IT MAY PROVIDE FUTURE UNSPECIFIED FEATURES AND

ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS FREE OF CHARGE TO CUSTOMERS. ACCORDINGLY, APPLE TV AND IPHONE HANDSETS SALES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH SOP

NO. 97-2. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY'S POLICY IS TO DEFER THE ASSOCIATED REVENUE AND COST OF GOODS SOLD AT THE TIME OF SALE, AND RECOGNIZE BOTH ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER

THE CURRENTLY ESTIMATED 24-MONTH ECONOMIC LIFE OF THESE PRODUCTS, WITH ANY LOSS RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF SALE. COSTS INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR ENGINEERING, SALES, MARKETING AND WARRANTY

ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY RECORDS ITS ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS BASED UPON ITS ASSESSMENT OF VARIOUS FACTORS. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, THE AGE OF THE ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE BALANCES, CREDIT QUALITY OF THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMERS, CURRENT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT CUSTOMERS' ABILITY TO PAY.

SHIPPING COSTS

FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, AMOUNTS BILLED TO CUSTOMERS RELATED TO SHIPPING AND HANDLING ARE CLASSIFIED AS REVENUE, AND THE COMPANY'S SHIPPING AND HANDLING COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN

COST OF SALES.

WARRANTY EXPENSE

THE COMPANY GENERALLY PROVIDES FOR THE ESTIMATED COST OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF

ITS PREEXISTING WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES. FOR PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING PURSUANT

TO SOP NO. 97-2, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES WARRANTY EXPENSE AS INCURRED.

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE MARKETED ARE SUBJECT TO CAPITALIZATION

BEGINNING WHEN A PRODUCT'S TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED AND ENDING WHEN A PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 86,

COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE

MARKETED

. IN MOST INSTANCES, THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED SOON AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY

HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED. THEREFORE, COSTS INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO ACHIEVEMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY ARE USUALLY NOT SIGNIFICANT, AND GENERALLY MOST SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS HAVE BEEN EXPENSED.

IN

2007, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT BOTH MAC OS X VERSION 10.5 LEOPARD ("MAC OS X LEOPARD") AND IPHONE ACHIEVED TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY. DURING 2007, THE COMPANY CAPITALIZED $75 MILLION OF

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF LEOPARD AND IPHONE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 86, THE CAPITALIZED COSTS RELATED TO MAC OS X LEOPARD AND IPHONE ARE AMORTIZED TO COST OF

SALES COMMENCING WHEN EACH RESPECTIVE PRODUCT BEGINS SHIPPING AND ARE RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A 3 YEAR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING TECHNOLOGY.

63

TOTAL

AMORTIZATION RELATED TO CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS WAS $13 MILLION, $18 MILLION, AND $16 MILLION IN 2007, 2006, AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

ADVERTISING COSTS

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $467 MILLION, $338 MILLION, AND $287 MILLION FOR 2007, 2006, AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004) ("SFAS NO. 123R"),

SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT

, WHICH ADDRESSES THE ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS IN WHICH AN ENTERPRISE RECEIVES EMPLOYEE SERVICES IN EXCHANGE FOR (A) EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OF

THE ENTERPRISE OR (B) LIABILITIES THAT ARE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ENTERPRISE'S EQUITY INSTRUMENTS OR THAT MAY BE SETTLED BY THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. IN

JANUARY 2005, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ("SEC") ISSUED SAB NO. 107, WHICH PROVIDES SUPPLEMENTAL IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR SFAS NO. 123R. SFAS NO. 123R

ELIMINATES THE ABILITY TO ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD ("APB") OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO

EMPLOYEES

, AND INSTEAD GENERALLY REQUIRES THAT SUCH TRANSACTIONS BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING A FAIR-VALUE-BASED

METHOD. THE COMPANY USES THE BLACK-SCHOLES-MERTON ("BSM") OPTION-PRICING MODEL TO DETERMINE THE FAIR-VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS UNDER SFAS NO. 123R, CONSISTENT WITH THAT USED FOR

PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES UNDER SFAS NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.

SFAS

NO. 123R PROHIBITS RECOGNITION OF A DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR AN EXCESS TAX BENEFIT THAT HAS NOT BEEN REALIZED. THE COMPANY WILL RECOGNIZE A BENEFIT FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN EQUITY IF

AN INCREMENTAL TAX BENEFIT IS REALIZED BY FOLLOWING THE ORDERING PROVISIONS OF THE TAX LAW. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR THE INDIRECT EFFECTS OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ON THE RESEARCH TAX

CREDIT, THE FOREIGN TAX CREDIT, AND THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURING DEDUCTION THROUGH THE INCOME STATEMENT.

PRIOR

TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R, THE COMPANY MEASURED COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS USING THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD PRESCRIBED BY APB OPINION

NO. 25. THE COMPANY APPLIED THE DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123 AS AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 148,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATIONTRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE,

AS IF THE FAIR-VALUE-BASED METHOD HAD BEEN APPLIED IN MEASURING COMPENSATION EXPENSE. UNDER APB OPINION

NO. 25, WHEN THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS WAS EQUAL TO THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK ON THE DATE OF THE GRANT, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE WAS RECOGNIZED.

64

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE ILLUSTRATES THE EFFECT ON NET INCOME AFTER TAXES AND NET INCOME PER COMMON SHARE AS IF THE COMPANY HAD APPLIED THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123 TO

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE

PERIOD. DILUTED EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE IS COMPUTED BY DIVIDING INCOME AVAILABLE TO COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BY THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD

INCREASED TO INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF ADDITIONAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING IF THE DILUTIVE POTENTIAL SHARES OF COMMON STOCK HAD BEEN ISSUED. THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF

OUTSTANDING OPTIONS, SHARES TO BE PURCHASED UNDER THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN, UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ("RSUS") IS REFLECTED IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY

APPLICATION OF THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. UNDER THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD, AN INCREASE IN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK CAN RESULT IN A GREATER DILUTIVE EFFECT FROM OUTSTANDING

OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, AND RSUS. ADDITIONALLY, THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS AND THE VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK AND RSUS CAN RESULT IN A GREATER DILUTIVE EFFECT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE.

POTENTIALLY DILUTIVE SECURITIES INCLUDE STOCK OPTIONS, UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK, AND RSUS.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS, NET INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME REFERS TO REVENUE, EXPENSES, GAINS, AND LOSSES THAT UNDER

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ARE RECORDED AS AN ELEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY BUT ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET INCOME. THE COMPANY'S OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONSISTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES NOT USING THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES CATEGORIZED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, AND NET DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES ON CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

THE COMPANY REPORTS SEGMENT INFORMATION BASED ON THE "MANAGEMENT" APPROACH. THE MANAGEMENT APPROACH DESIGNATES THE INTERNAL REPORTING USED BY MANAGEMENT FOR MAKING DECISIONS

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY FOREIGN COMPANIES, AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT AND TIME DEPOSITS WITH FOREIGN INSTITUTIONS, MOST OF WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS. THE COMPANY HAD $11 MILLION

IN NET UNREALIZED LOSSES ON ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INVESTMENTS WITH STATED MATURITIES RANGING FROM 1 TO 5 YEARS, AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, AND NET UNREALIZED

LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $687,000 ON ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INVESTMENTS WITH STATED MATURITIES LESS THAN 1 YEAR, AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. THE COMPANY MAY SELL ITS

INVESTMENTS PRIOR TO THEIR STATED MATURITIES FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES, IN ANTICIPATION OF CREDIT DETERIORATION, OR FOR DURATION MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET GAINS BEFORE TAXES OF APPROXIMATELY

$474,000 IN 2007 AND NET LOSSES BEFORE TAXES OF APPROXIMATELY $434,000 AND $137,000 IN 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

THE

UNREALIZED LOSSES ON THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENTS DURING 2007 IN U.S. CORPORATE SECURITIES AND FOREIGN SECURITIES AND DURING 2006 IN U.S. CORPORATE SECURITIES WERE CAUSED PRIMARILY BY CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY INVESTS IN HIGHLY-RATED SECURITIES WITH STRONG LIQUIDITY AND WITH LOW PROBABILITIES OF DEFAULT. THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT POLICY REQUIRES INVESTMENTS TO BE RATED

SINGLE-A OR BETTER. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THE DECLINES TO BE TEMPORARY IN NATURE. DURING 2007, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD ANY MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT ON OUTSTANDING SECURITIES. AS

OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER THE INVESTMENTS TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED.

MARKET

VALUES WERE DETERMINED FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL SECURITY IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. WHEN EVALUATING THE INVESTMENTS FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT, THE COMPANY REVIEWS

FACTORS SUCH AS THE LENGTH OF TIME AND EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE HAS BEEN BELOW COST BASIS, THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE ISSUER, AND THE COMPANY'S ABILITY AND INTENT TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT FOR A

PERIOD OF TIME, WHICH MAY BE SUFFICIENT FOR ANTICIPATED RECOVERY IN MARKET VALUE.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS AND DIRECTLY TO CERTAIN EDUCATION, CONSUMER, AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY

DOES NOT REQUIRE COLLATERAL FROM ITS CUSTOMERS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY REQUIRES COLLATERAL IN CERTAIN INSTANCES TO LIMIT CREDIT RISK. IN ADDITION, WHEN POSSIBLE, THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO LIMIT CREDIT

RISK ON TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CREDIT INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN LATIN AMERICA, EUROPE, ASIA, AND AUSTRALIA BY ARRANGING WITH THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANIES TO PROVIDE FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS

AND OTHER LOAN AND LEASE PROGRAMS TO THE COMPANY'S DIRECT CUSTOMERS. THESE CREDIT-FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE DIRECTLY BETWEEN THE THIRD-PARTY FINANCING COMPANY AND THE END CUSTOMER. AS SUCH, THE

COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT ASSUME ANY RECOURSE OR CREDIT RISK SHARING RELATED TO ANY OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER, CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES NOT

68

COVERED

BY COLLATERAL, THIRD-PARTY FLOORING ARRANGEMENTS, OR CREDIT INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS. ONE CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 11%

OF TRADE RECEIVABLES AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, WHILE NO CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF TRADE RECEIVABLES AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006.

VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES

THE COMPANY HAS NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF ITS MANUFACTURING VENDORS RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS TO THESE MANUFACTURING VENDORS

WHO MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY PURCHASES THESE RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS DIRECTLY FROM SUPPLIERS. THESE NON-TRADE

RECEIVABLES, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS IN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, TOTALED $2.4 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30,

2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT REFLECT THE SALE OF THESE COMPONENTS IN NET SALES AND DOES NOT RECOGNIZE ANY PROFITS ON THESE SALES UNTIL THE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH TO THE END CUSTOMER AT

WHICH TIME THE PROFIT IS RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION OF COST OF SALES.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVES TO PARTIALLY OFFSET ITS BUSINESS EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE USED TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RISK ON CERTAIN EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND TO HEDGE THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ON EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS ON CERTAIN FORECASTED REVENUE AND COST OF SALES. THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING

POLICIES FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE BASED ON WHETHER THE INSTRUMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGE OR NON-HEDGE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS ALL DERIVATIVES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR

VALUE.

NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNTS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS PROVIDE ONE MEASURE OF THE TRANSACTION VOLUME OUTSTANDING AS OF YEAR-END, AND DO NOT REPRESENT THE AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY'S

EXPOSURE TO CREDIT OR MARKET LOSS. THE CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS SHOWN IN THE TABLE ABOVE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S GROSS EXPOSURE TO POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING LOSS ON THESE TRANSACTIONS IF ALL COUNTERPARTIES

FAILED TO PERFORM ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT, BASED ON THEN-CURRENT CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AT EACH RESPECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CREDIT LOSS AND MARKET RISK WILL

VARY OVER TIME AS A FUNCTION OF CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES.

THE

ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE BASED ON APPLICABLE AND COMMONLY USED PRICING MODELS AND PREVAILING FINANCIAL MARKET INFORMATION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. ALTHOUGH

THE TABLE ABOVE REFLECTS THE NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL, FAIR VALUE, AND CREDIT RISK AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS, IT DOES NOT REFLECT THE GAINS OR LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

EXPOSURES AND TRANSACTIONS THAT THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE. THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY REALIZED UPON SETTLEMENT OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, TOGETHER WITH THE GAINS AND

LOSSES ON THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES, WILL DEPEND ON ACTUAL MARKET CONDITIONS DURING THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE INSTRUMENTS.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO PROTECT AGAINST FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH EXISTING ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES, CERTAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED TRANSACTIONS, FORECASTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AND NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. GENERALLY, THE COMPANY'S PRACTICE IS TO HEDGE A MAJORITY OF ITS

MATERIAL FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE NOT TO HEDGE CERTAIN FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES DUE TO IMMATERIALITY, PROHIBITIVE ECONOMIC COST OF HEDGING PARTICULAR EXPOSURES, OR

LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF APPROPRIATE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

TO

HELP PROTECT GROSS MARGINS FROM FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, THE COMPANY'S U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL SUBSIDIARIES HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE, AND THE

COMPANY'S NON-U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL SUBSIDIARIES SELLING IN LOCAL CURRENCIES HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INVENTORY PURCHASES NOT DENOMINATED IN THE SUBSIDIARIES' FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY.

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH HEDGES OF FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF NET SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED SALES ARE RECOGNIZED, AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME RELATED TO INVENTORY PURCHASES IS RECOGNIZED AS A COMPONENT OF COST OF SALES IN THE SAME PERIOD AS THE RELATED COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED.

70

TYPICALLY,

THE COMPANY HEDGES PORTIONS OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUE AND INVENTORY PURCHASES OVER A TIME HORIZON OF UP TO 6 MONTHS.

DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES MUST BE DE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WHEN IT IS PROBABLE THE FORECASTED HEDGED TRANSACTION WILL NOT OCCUR IN THE INITIALLY IDENTIFIED TIME

PERIOD OR WITHIN A SUBSEQUENT 2 MONTH TIME PERIOD. DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE IMMEDIATELY RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS

IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE. ANY SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO REFLECTED IN CURRENT EARNINGS UNLESS THEY ARE RE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF OTHER

TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED NET GAINS OF APPROXIMATELY $672,000 AND $421,000 IN 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, AND A NET LOSS OF $1.6 MILLION IN 2005 IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE RELATED

TO THE LOSS OF HEDGE DESIGNATION ON DISCONTINUED CASH FLOW HEDGES DUE TO CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S FORECAST OF FUTURE NET SALES AND COST OF SALES AND DUE TO PREVAILING MARKET CONDITIONS. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD A NET DEFERRED GAIN ASSOCIATED WITH CASH FLOW HEDGES OF APPROXIMATELY $468,000, NET OF TAXES, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO

EARNINGS BY THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008.

THE

NET GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DESIGNATED AS A NET INVESTMENT HEDGE IS INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT ACCOUNT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WITHIN SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY. FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD A NET LOSS OF $2.6 MILLION AND A NET GAIN OF

$7.4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, INCLUDED IN THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT.

THE

COMPANY MAY ALSO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO OFFSET THE FOREIGN EXCHANGE GAINS AND LOSSES GENERATED BY THE RE-MEASUREMENT OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES RECORDED IN NON-FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE DERIVATIVES ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE AS OFFSETS TO THE CHANGES

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. DUE TO CURRENCY MARKET MOVEMENTS, CHANGES IN OPTION TIME VALUE CAN LEAD TO INCREASED VOLATILITY IN OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE.

THE

FOREIGN PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS BASED ON FOREIGN PRETAX EARNINGS OF $2.2 BILLION, $1.5 BILLION, AND $922 MILLION IN 2007, 2006, AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, $6.5 BILLION OF THE COMPANY'S CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WERE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND ARE GENERALLY BASED IN U.S.

DOLLAR-DENOMINATED HOLDINGS. AMOUNTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO U.S. INCOME TAXATION ON REPATRIATION TO THE U.S. THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PROVIDE FOR

ANY RELATED TAX LIABILITY ON AMOUNTS THAT MAY BE REPATRIATED, ASIDE FROM UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO BE INDEFINITELY REINVESTED IN

OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. U.S. INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED ON A CUMULATIVE TOTAL OF $2.4 BILLION OF SUCH EARNINGS. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT

MIGHT BE INCURRED IF THESE EARNINGS WERE TO BE DISTRIBUTED.

DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF TAX LOSSES, CREDITS, AND THE FUTURE INCOME TAX EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING AMOUNTS

OF EXISTING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR RESPECTIVE TAX BASES AND ARE MEASURED USING ENACTED TAX RATES THAT APPLY TO TAXABLE INCOME IN THE YEARS IN WHICH THOSE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ARE EXPECTED

TO BE RECOVERED OR SETTLED.

THE

COMPANY'S INCOME TAXES PAYABLE HAVE BEEN REDUCED BY THE TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS. THE COMPANY RECEIVES AN INCOME TAX BENEFIT CALCULATED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR MARKET

VALUE OF THE STOCK ISSUED AT THE TIME OF THE EXERCISE AND THE OPTION PRICE, TAX EFFECTED. THE NET TAX BENEFITS FROM EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSACTIONS WERE $398 MILLION, $419 MILLION,

AND $428 MILLION IN 2007, 2006, AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, AND WERE REFLECTED AS AN INCREASE TO COMMON STOCK IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY.

THE

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE ("IRS") HAS COMPLETED ITS FIELD AUDIT OF THE COMPANY'S FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2002 THROUGH 2003 AND PROPOSED CERTAIN ADJUSTMENTS. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

CONTEST CERTAIN OF THESE ADJUSTMENTS THROUGH THE IRS APPEALS OFFICE. ALL IRS AUDIT ISSUES FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2002 HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY STATE,

LOCAL, AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT ADEQUATE PROVISIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ANY ADJUSTMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM TAX EXAMINATIONS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF TAX AUDITS CANNOT BE

PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD ANY ISSUES ADDRESSED IN THE COMPANY'S TAX AUDITS BE RESOLVED IN A MANNER NOT CONSISTENT WITH MANAGEMENT'S EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO ADJUST ITS

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAX IN THE PERIOD SUCH RESOLUTION OCCURS. IN 2007 AND 2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED TAX BENEFITS OF $63 MILLION AND $20 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO THE SETTLEMENT OF

PRIOR YEAR TAX AUDITS IN THE U.S.

NOTE 6SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

PREFERRED STOCK

THE COMPANY HAS FIVE MILLION SHARES OF AUTHORIZED PREFERRED STOCK, NONE OF WHICH IS ISSUED OR OUTSTANDING. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE COMPANY'S RESTATED ARTICLES OF INCORPORATION,

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IS AUTHORIZED TO DETERMINE OR ALTER THE RIGHTS, PREFERENCES, PRIVILEGES AND RESTRICTIONS OF THE COMPANY'S AUTHORIZED BUT UNISSUED SHARES OF PREFERRED STOCK.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAS GRANTED RSUS TO MEMBERS OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT TEAM, EXCLUDING ITS CEO. THESE RSUS GENERALLY VEST OVER FOUR YEARS EITHER AT THE END OF

THE FOUR-YEAR SERVICE PERIOD, IN TWO EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ON THE SECOND AND FOURTH ANNIVERSARIES OF THE DATE OF GRANT, OR IN EQUAL INSTALLMENTS ON EACH OF THE FIRST THROUGH FOURTH

ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT DATE. UPON VESTING, THE RSUS WILL CONVERT INTO AN EQUIVALENT NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY FOR RSUS IS BASED ON THE

CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND IS AMORTIZED RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. THE RSUS HAVE BEEN REFLECTED IN

THE CALCULATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE UTILIZING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD.

DURING

2007 AND 2006, 45,000 AND 2.47 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, PREVIOUSLY GRANTED RSUS VESTED. A MAJORITY OF THESE VESTED RSUS WERE NET-SHARE SETTLED SUCH THAT THE COMPANY WITHHELD

SHARES WITH VALUE EQUIVALENT TO THE EMPLOYEES' MINIMUM STATUTORY OBLIGATION FOR THE APPLICABLE INCOME AND OTHER EMPLOYMENT TAXES, AND REMITTED THE CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES. THE TOTAL

SHARES WITHHELD OF APPROXIMATELY 20,000 AND 990,000 FOR 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, WAS BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE RSUS ON THEIR VESTING DATE AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPANY'S CLOSING STOCK PRICE. TOTAL

PAYMENTS FOR THE EMPLOYEES' TAX OBLIGATIONS TO THE TAXING AUTHORITIES WERE $3 MILLION AND $59 MILLION IN 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE REFLECTED AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY WITHIN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. THESE NET-SHARE SETTLEMENTS HAD THE EFFECT OF SHARE REPURCHASES BY THE COMPANY AS THEY REDUCED AND RETIRED THE NUMBER OF SHARES THAT WOULD HAVE

OTHERWISE BEEN ISSUED AS A RESULT OF THE VESTING AND DID NOT REPRESENT AN EXPENSE TO THE COMPANY.

CEO RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD

ON MARCH 19, 2003, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS GRANTED 10 MILLION SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK TO THE COMPANY'S CEO THAT VESTED ON MARCH 19, 2006. THE

AMOUNT OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD EXPENSED BY THE COMPANY WAS BASED ON THE CLOSING MARKET PRICE OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND WAS AMORTIZED RATABLY ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE THREE-YEAR REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. UPON VESTING DURING 2006, THE 10 MILLION SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK HAD A FAIR VALUE OF

$646.6 MILLION AND HAD GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE OF $7.48 PER SHARE. THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD WAS NET-SHARE SETTLED SUCH THAT THE COMPANY WITHHELD SHARES WITH VALUE

EQUIVALENT TO THE CEO'S MINIMUM STATUTORY OBLIGATION FOR THE APPLICABLE

76

INCOME

AND OTHER EMPLOYMENT TAXES, AND REMITTED THE CASH TO THE APPROPRIATE TAXING AUTHORITIES. THE TOTAL SHARES WITHHELD OF 4.6 MILLION WERE BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE RESTRICTED STOCK AWARD ON

THE VESTING DATE AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPANY'S CLOSING STOCK PRICE OF $64.66. THE REMAINING SHARES NET OF THOSE WITHHELD WERE DELIVERED TO THE COMPANY'S CEO. TOTAL PAYMENTS FOR THE CEO'S TAX

OBLIGATIONS TO THE TAXING AUTHORITIES WAS $296 MILLION IN 2006 AND ARE REFLECTED AS A FINANCING ACTIVITY WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. THE NET-SHARE SETTLEMENT

HAD THE EFFECT OF SHARE REPURCHASES BY THE COMPANY AS IT REDUCED AND RETIRED THE NUMBER OF SHARES OUTSTANDING AND DID NOT REPRESENT AN EXPENSE TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY'S CEO HAS NO REMAINING SHARES

OF RESTRICTED STOCK. FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND SEPTEMBER 24, 2005, COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO RESTRICTED STOCK WAS $4.6 MILLION AND $24.9 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN

IN JULY 1999, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A PLAN FOR THE COMPANY TO REPURCHASE UP TO $500 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK. THIS REPURCHASE PLAN DOES

NOT OBLIGATE THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE ANY SPECIFIC NUMBER OF SHARES OR ACQUIRE SHARES OVER ANY SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME. THE COMPANY HAS REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 13.1 MILLION SHARES AT A COST OF

$217 MILLION UNDER THIS PLAN AND WAS AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $283 MILLION OF ITS COMMON STOCK AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONSISTS OF TWO COMPONENTS, NET INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME REFERS TO REVENUE, EXPENSES, GAINS, AND LOSSES THAT UNDER

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES ARE RECORDED AS AN ELEMENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY BUT ARE EXCLUDED FROM NET INCOME. THE COMPANY'S OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CONSISTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS FROM THOSE SUBSIDIARIES NOT USING THE U.S. DOLLAR AS THEIR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES CATEGORIZED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, AND NET DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES ON CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR AS CASH FLOW HEDGES.

PER SHARE, RESPECTIVELY. AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE OF RSUS WAS $701.3 MILLION AND $262.5 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, RESPECTIVELY. RSUS THAT

VESTED DURING 2007 AND 2006 TOTALED 45,000 AND 2.47 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND HAD A FAIR VALUE OF $6.1 MILLION AND $148.5 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF THE VESTING DATE. SHARES OF

RSUS GRANTED AFTER APRIL 2005 HAVE BEEN DEDUCTED FROM THE SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE COMPANY'S STOCK OPTION PLANS UTILIZING A FACTOR OF TWO TIMES THE NUMBER OF RSUS GRANTED.

NOTE 7STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES IN NOTE 1 OF THE EFFECT ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 24, 2005 AS IF THE FAIR

VALUE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION HAD BEEN USED FOR ITS EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION GRANTS AND EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN PURCHASES. THESE PRO FORMA EFFECTS HAVE BEEN ESTIMATED AT

THE DATE OF GRANT AND BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD, RESPECTIVELY, USING THE BSM OPTION-PRICING MODEL.

THE

COMPANY USES THE BSM OPTION-PRICING MODEL TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS. THE BSM OPTION-PRICING MODEL INCORPORATES VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDING EXPECTED VOLATILITY, EXPECTED

LIFE, AND INTEREST RATES. THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK OVER THE MOST RECENT PERIOD COMMENSURATE WITH THE ESTIMATED EXPECTED LIFE OF THE

COMPANY'S STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS INCLUDING IMPLIED VOLATILITY IN MARKET TRADED OPTIONS ON THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK. THE COMPANY BASES ITS EXPECTED LIFE ASSUMPTION ON ITS HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE AND ON THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS OF THE STOCK AWARDS IT GRANTS TO EMPLOYEES. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS ESTIMATED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE AWARD'S FAIR-VALUE AS

CALCULATED BY THE BSM OPTION-PRICING MODEL AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD.

THE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR 2007, 2006, AND 2005 AND THE RESULTING ESTIMATES OF WEIGHTED-AVERAGE FAIR VALUE PER SHARE OF OPTIONS GRANTED AND FOR STOCK PURCHASES DURING THOSE PERIODS ARE

ACCRUED WARRANTY AND INDEMNIFICATIONS

THE COMPANY OFFERS A BASIC LIMITED PARTS AND LABOR WARRANTY ON ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE BASIC WARRANTY PERIOD FOR HARDWARE PRODUCTS IS TYPICALLY ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF

PURCHASE BY THE END-USER. THE COMPANY ALSO OFFERS A 90-DAY BASIC WARRANTY FOR ITS SERVICE PARTS USED TO REPAIR THE COMPANY'S HARDWARE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY PROVIDES CURRENTLY

FOR THE ESTIMATED COST THAT MAY BE INCURRED UNDER ITS BASIC LIMITED PRODUCT WARRANTIES AT THE TIME RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING APPROPRIATE ACCRUALS FOR PRODUCT

WARRANTY OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE THE SIZE OF THE INSTALLED BASE OF PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO WARRANTY PROTECTION, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED WARRANTY CLAIM RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED

COST-PER-CLAIM, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES THAT ARE OUTSIDE OF THE COMPANY'S TYPICAL EXPERIENCE. THE COMPANY ASSESSES THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PREEXISTING WARRANTY

LIABILITIES AND ADJUSTS THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY BASED ON ACTUAL EXPERIENCE AND CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES. FOR PRODUCTS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING PURSUANT TO SOP

NO. 97-2, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES WARRANTY EXPENSE AS INCURRED.

THE

COMPANY PERIODICALLY PROVIDES UPDATES TO ITS APPLICATIONS AND SYSTEM SOFTWARE TO MAINTAIN THE SOFTWARE'S COMPLIANCE WITH SPECIFICATIONS. THE ESTIMATED COST TO DEVELOP SUCH UPDATES IS ACCOUNTED FOR

AS WARRANTY COSTS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME RELATED SOFTWARE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING APPROPRIATE ACCRUALS RELATED TO SUCH UPDATES INCLUDE THE NUMBER OF UNITS

DELIVERED, THE NUMBER OF UPDATES EXPECTED TO OCCUR, AND THE HISTORICAL COST AND ESTIMATED FUTURE COST OF THE RESOURCES NECESSARY TO DEVELOP THESE UPDATES.

THE

COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT INDEMNIFY END-USERS OF ITS OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE AGAINST LEGAL CLAIMS THAT THE SOFTWARE INFRINGES THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS. OTHER AGREEMENTS ENTERED INTO BY THE COMPANY SOMETIMES INCLUDE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY COULD BE SUBJECT TO COSTS AND/OR DAMAGES IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM

AGAINST THE COMPANY OR AN INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS RESULTING FROM SUCH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM ASSERTED AGAINST ITSELF OR AN

INDEMNIFIED THIRD-PARTY AND, IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO UNRESOLVED INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS SUBJECT TO INDEMNIFICATION THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DID NOT RECORD A LIABILITY FOR INFRINGEMENT COSTS AS OF EITHER SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 OR SEPTEMBER 30, 2006.

CONCENTRATIONS IN THE AVAILABLE SOURCES OF SUPPLY OF MATERIALS AND PRODUCT

CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, MICROPROCESSORS, ENCLOSURES, CERTAIN LCDS, CERTAIN OPTICAL DRIVES, AND APPLICATION-SPECIFIC INTEGRATED CIRCUITS ("ASICS")

ARE CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES WHICH SUBJECTS THE COMPANY TO SUPPLY AND PRICING RISKS. MANY OF THESE AND OTHER KEY COMPONENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE

SOURCES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NAND FLASH MEMORY, DRAM MEMORY, AND CERTAIN LCDS, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE SHORTAGES AND SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY PRICING FLUCTUATIONS. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF CRITICAL COMPONENTS AT FAVORABLE PRICING, AND THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO EXTEND OR RENEW THESE

AGREEMENTS WHEN THEY EXPIRE. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF SUPPLY SHORTAGES AND/OR PRICE INCREASES THAT CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT GROSS MARGINS AND OPERATING MARGINS. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE GLOBAL PERSONAL COMPUTER, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES, AND NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE

COMPANY OFTEN UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A

KEY SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT TO THE COMPANY WERE TO BE DELAYED OR CURTAILED, OR IN THE EVENT A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYS SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO

SHIP RELATED PRODUCTS IN DESIRED QUANTITIES AND IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COULD ALSO BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED DEPENDING ON THE TIME

REQUIRED TO OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM THE ORIGINAL SOURCE, OR TO IDENTIFY AND OBTAIN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES FROM AN ALTERNATIVE SOURCE. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE COMPONENTS MAY BE

AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS WERE TO DECIDE TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANY'S REQUIREMENTS. FINALLY, SIGNIFICANT PORTIONS OF THE

COMPANY'S CPUS, IPODS, IPHONES, LOGIC BOARDS, AND OTHER ASSEMBLED PRODUCTS ARE NOW MANUFACTURED BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, PRIMARILY IN VARIOUS PARTS OF ASIA. A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF THIS

OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURING IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED BY ONLY A FEW OF THE COMPANY'S OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, OFTEN IN SINGLE LOCATIONS. CERTAIN OF THESE OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ARE THE SOLE-SOURCED

SUPPLIER OF COMPONENTS AND MANUFACTURING OUTSOURCING FOR MANY OF THE COMPANY'S KEY PRODUCTS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ASSEMBLY

83

OF

MOST OF THE COMPANY'S PORTABLE MAC COMPUTERS, IPODS, AND IPHONES. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY WORKS CLOSELY WITH ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS ON MANUFACTURING SCHEDULES, THE COMPANY'S OPERATING RESULTS COULD

BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF ITS OUTSOURCING PARTNERS WERE UNABLE TO MEET THEIR PRODUCTION COMMITMENTS.

LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS WITH HYNIX SEMICONDUCTOR, INC., INTEL CORPORATION, MICRON

TECHNOLOGY, INC., SAMSUNG ELECTRONICS CO., LTD., AND TOSHIBA CORPORATION TO SECURE SUPPLY OF NAND FLASH MEMORY THROUGH CALENDAR YEAR 2010. AS PART OF THESE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY

PREPAID $1.25 BILLION FOR FLASH MEMORY COMPONENTS DURING 2006, WHICH WILL BE APPLIED TO CERTAIN INVENTORY PURCHASES MADE OVER THE LIFE OF EACH RESPECTIVE AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY UTILIZED

$208 MILLION OF THE PREPAYMENT AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007.

CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS AND HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY ADJUDICATED. IN THE OPINION OF

MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY RELATED TO ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS

FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS OR SHOULD

SEVERAL OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

PRODUCTION

AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS

THE ABILITY TO RETURN PRODUCT AT THE END OF ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN

PASSED IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES INCLUDING VARIOUS COUNTRIES WITHIN EUROPE AND ASIA, CERTAIN CANADIAN PROVINCES AND CERTAIN STATES WITHIN THE U.S. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY

DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE FUTURE BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

NOTE 9SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 131,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION

, THE COMPANY REPORTS

SEGMENT INFORMATION BASED ON THE "MANAGEMENT" APPROACH. THE MANAGEMENT APPROACH DESIGNATES THE INTERNAL REPORTING USED BY MANAGEMENT FOR MAKING DECISIONS AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE AS THE SOURCE OF THE

COMPANY'S REPORTABLE SEGMENTS.

THE

COMPANY MANAGES ITS BUSINESS PRIMARILY ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY DETERMINED ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE NATURE AND LOCATION OF ITS CUSTOMERS, TO

BE THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, ASIA-PACIFIC, RETAIL, AND FILEMAKER OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY'S FOUR GEOGRAPHICAL SEGMENTS, TOGETHER WITH THE RETAIL SEGMENT, ALL SELL THE SAME PRODUCTS TO

THE SAME TYPES OF CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY'S REPORTABLE OPERATING SEGMENTS ARE COMPRISED OF THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, JAPAN, AND RETAIL OPERATIONS. THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, AND JAPAN REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

EXCLUDE ACTIVITIES RELATED TO THE RETAIL SEGMENT. THE AMERICAS SEGMENT INCLUDES BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH AMERICA. THE EUROPE SEGMENT INCLUDES EUROPEAN COUNTRIES AS WELL AS THE MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA. THE

RETAIL SEGMENT OPERATES APPLE-OWNED RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S., CANADA, JAPAN, THE U.K. AND ITALY. OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS INCLUDE

84

ASIA-PACIFIC,

WHICH INCLUDES AUSTRALIA AND ASIA EXCEPT FOR JAPAN, AND THE COMPANY'S SUBSIDIARY, FILEMAKER, INC. EACH REPORTABLE GEOGRAPHIC OPERATING SEGMENT PROVIDES SIMILAR

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, SIMILAR SERVICES AND THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES OF THE VARIOUS SEGMENTS ARE THE SAME AS THOSE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1.

THE

COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON NET SALES AND OPERATING INCOME. NET SALES FOR GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENTS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON THE LOCATION OF THE CUSTOMERS, AND NET

SALES FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT ARE BASED ON SALES FROM THE COMPANY'S RETAIL STORES. OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT INCLUDES NET SALES TO THIRD PARTIES, RELATED COST OF SALES, AND OPERATING EXPENSES

DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SEGMENT. ADVERTISING EXPENSES ARE GENERALLY INCLUDED IN THE GEOGRAPHIC SEGMENT IN WHICH THE EXPENDITURES ARE INCURRED. OPERATING INCOME FOR EACH SEGMENT EXCLUDES OTHER

INCOME AND EXPENSE AND CERTAIN EXPENSES MANAGED OUTSIDE THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. COSTS EXCLUDED FROM SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE VARIOUS CORPORATE EXPENSES SUCH AS MANUFACTURING COSTS AND

VARIANCES NOT INCLUDED IN STANDARD COSTS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CORPORATE MARKETING EXPENSES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, INCOME TAXES, VARIOUS NONRECURRING CHARGES, AND OTHER SEPARATELY

MANAGED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT INCLUDE INTERCOMPANY TRANSFERS BETWEEN SEGMENTS FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES. SEGMENT ASSETS EXCLUDE CORPORATE ASSETS SUCH AS CASH,

SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS, MANUFACTURING FACILITIES, MISCELLANEOUS CORPORATE INFRASTRUCTURE, GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND RETAIL STORE

CONSTRUCTION-IN-PROGRESS NOT SUBJECT TO DEPRECIATION. EXCEPT FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT, CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE NOT REPORTED TO MANAGEMENT BY

SEGMENT. CAPITAL ASSET PURCHASES BY THE RETAIL SEGMENT WERE $294 MILLION, $200 MILLION, AND $132 MILLION FOR 2007, 2006, AND 2005 RESPECTIVELY.

FROM

THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT IN FISCAL 2001 THROUGH THE QUARTER ENDED MARCH 31, 2007, COMPANY MANAGEMENT ASSESSED THE SEGMENT'S OPERATING PERFORMANCE DIFFERENTLY FROM THE

COMPANY'S OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY'S RETAIL INITIATIVE WAS AN UNPROVEN CONCEPT AT INCEPTION, MANAGEMENT CHOSE TO MEASURE THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S PERFORMANCE IN A MANNER THAT WOULD

ALLOW COMPARABILITY TO THE COMPANY'S MAJOR CHANNEL PARTNERS OPERATING RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S. THERE WERE THREE SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE MEASUREMENT OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S RESULTS RELATIVE TO

THE COMPANY'S OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS. FIRST, THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S OPERATING INCOME REFLECTED COST OF SALES FOR APPLE PRODUCTS AT AMOUNTS NORMALLY CHARGED TO APPLE'S MAJOR U.S. CHANNEL PARTNERS FOR

THE SAME PRODUCTS, LESS THE COST OF THE COMPANY'S SALES PROGRAMS AND OTHER COSTS TO SUPPORT THOSE PARTNERS. SECOND, THE COST OF SALES OF THE COMPANY'S SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS, INCLUDING THE

APPLECARE PROTECTION PLAN ("APP") AND .MAC, WERE REFLECTED IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S RESULTS AT THE COSTS CHARGED TO MAJOR CHANNEL PARTNERS FOR SUCH CONTRACTS, AND ALL ASSOCIATED REVENUE WAS REFLECTED

IN THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S RESULTS AT THE TIME OF SALE RATHER THAN BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE LIVES OF THE RESPECTIVE AGREEMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAD NOT YET EARNED THE REVENUE OR INCURRED THE COST

ASSOCIATED WITH THE SALE OF SUCH CONTRACTS, AN OFFSET TO THESE AMOUNTS WAS RECOGNIZED IN OTHER SEGMENTS' NET SALES AND COST OF SALES. THIRD, THE COMPANY ALLOCATED CERTAIN EXPENSES RELATED TO THE

OPERATION OF ITS HIGH-PROFILE STORES TO CORPORATE MARKETING EXPENSE.

HAVING

OPERATED THE COMPANY'S RETAIL STORES SUCCESSFULLY FOR MORE THAN SIX YEARS, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ITS RETAIL INITIATIVE IS A PROVEN CONCEPT THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN INTEGRAL ELEMENT OF THE

COMPANY'S DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING STRATEGIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS SALES OF IPHONE BY THE COMPANY'S GEOGRAPHIC AND RETAIL OPERATING SEGMENTS TO GENERATE SIGNIFICANT LEVELS OF DEFERRED

REVENUE AND DEFERRED COST OF SALES OVER TIME. IN CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTORS, MANAGEMENT HAS DETERMINED THAT BEGINNING WITH THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2007, ALIGNING MEASUREMENTS FOR THE

PERFORMANCE OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT WITH THOSE USED FOR THE COMPANY'S OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS PROVIDES THE MOST MEANINGFUL INFORMATION. ACCORDINGLY, MANAGEMENT HAS BEGUN TO MEASURE THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S

OPERATING PERFORMANCE IN A MANNER

85

GENERALLY

CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANY'S OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS. THE COST OF SALES OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS SOLD THROUGH THE RETAIL SEGMENT IS NOW REFLECTED AT AMOUNTS SIMILAR TO THE COST OF SALES

OF THE SAME PRODUCTS REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY'S OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS. REVENUE FROM APP AND .MAC CONTRACTS SOLD THROUGH THE RETAIL SEGMENT IS NOW BEING RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIVES OF THE RESPECTIVE

SERVICE AGREEMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE RETAIL SEGMENT IS APPLYING THE SAME SUBSCRIPTION ACCOUNTING TO IPHONE NET SALES AND COST OF SALES THAT THE COMPANY'S OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS APPLY. MANAGEMENT

BELIEVES ALIGNING MEASUREMENTS FOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT WITH THOSE USED FOR THE COMPANY'S OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS WILL PROVIDE GREATER COMPARABILITY WITH THE REST OF THE COMPANY'S

SEGMENTS AND ALLOW FOR MORE MEANINGFUL ASSESSMENT OF THE RETAIL SEGMENT'S OPERATING RESULTS. THE COMPANY HAS RECLASSIFIED PRIOR PERIOD OPERATING SEGMENT RESULTS TO REFLECT THESE CHANGES IN THE

MEASUREMENT OF THE OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE RETAIL SEGMENT, ALONG WITH THE CORRESPONDING OFFSETTING IMPACT TO THE COMPANY'S OTHER OPERATING SEGMENTS.

THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOCATE CERTAIN OPERATING EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS HIGH-PROFILE STORES TO CORPORATE MARKETING EXPENSE TO REFLECT THE ESTIMATED COMPANY-WIDE

BENEFIT. THESE HIGH-PROFILE STORES ARE LARGER THAN THE COMPANY'S TYPICAL RETAIL STORES AND WERE DESIGNED TO FURTHER PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND PROVIDE A VENUE FOR CERTAIN CORPORATE SALES

AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING CORPORATE BRIEFINGS. THE ALLOCATION OF THESE OPERATING COSTS TO CORPORATE EXPENSE IS BASED ON THE AMOUNT INCURRED FOR A HIGH-PROFILE STORE IN EXCESS OF

THAT INCURRED BY A MORE TYPICAL COMPANY RETAIL LOCATION. THE COMPANY HAD OPENED A TOTAL OF EIGHT HIGH-PROFILE STORES AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007. EXPENSES ALLOCATED TO CORPORATE

MARKETING RESULTING FROM THE OPERATIONS OF HIGH-PROFILE STORES WERE $39 MILLION, $33 MILLION, AND $31 MILLION FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2007,

SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, AND SEPTEMBER 24, 2005 RESPECTIVELY.

APPLE INC..

WE

HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF APPLE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, AND THE RELATED

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2007. THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN

OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFERRED TO ABOVE PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF APPLE INC. AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF

SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 29,

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS

APPLE INC..

WE

HAVE AUDITED APPLE INC.'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).

APPLE'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED

IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDIT

ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A

COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN

TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE

BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE

SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN

OUR OPINION, APPLE INC. MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY COSO.

WE

ALSO HAVE AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF APPLE INC. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29,

2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE YEARS IN THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDED

SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, AND OUR REPORT DATED NOVEMBER 15, 2007 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

EVALUATION OF DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

BASED ON AN EVALUATION UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER

HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANY'S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-15(E) AND 15D-15(E) UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED

("EXCHANGE ACT") WERE EFFECTIVE AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 TO ENSURE THAT INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED BY THE COMPANY IN REPORTS THAT IT FILES OR SUBMITS UNDER THE EXCHANGE ACT IS

(I) RECORDED, PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS SPECIFIED IN THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RULES AND FORMS AND (II) ACCUMULATED AND COMMUNICATED TO THE

COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING ITS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, AS APPROPRIATE TO ALLOW TIMELY DECISIONS REGARDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURE.

INHERENT LIMITATIONS OVER INTERNAL CONTROLS

THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

THAT.

(I)

PERTAIN

TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS;

(II)

PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES,

AND THAT THE COMPANY'S RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS; AND

(III)

PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY'S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

MANAGEMENT,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY'S CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROLS WILL PREVENT OR DETECT ALL ERRORS AND ALL FRAUD. A CONTROL

SYSTEM, NO MATTER HOW WELL DESIGNED AND OPERATED, CAN PROVIDE ONLY REASONABLE, NOT ABSOLUTE, ASSURANCE THAT THE OBJECTIVES OF THE CONTROL SYSTEM ARE MET. FURTHER, THE DESIGN OF A CONTROL SYSTEM MUST

REFLECT THE FACT THAT THERE ARE RESOURCE CONSTRAINTS, AND THE BENEFITS OF CONTROLS MUST BE CONSIDERED RELATIVE TO THEIR COSTS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS IN ALL CONTROL SYSTEMS, NO EVALUATION

OF INTERNAL CONTROLS CAN PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT ALL CONTROL ISSUES AND INSTANCES OF FRAUD, IF ANY, HAVE BEEN DETECTED. ALSO, ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF CONTROLS IN FUTURE PERIODS

ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THOSE INTERNAL CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN BUSINESS CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

MANAGEMENT'S ANNUAL REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING (AS DEFINED IN RULE 13A-15(F)

UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED). MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE CRITERIA SET

FORTH IN INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION ("COSO"). BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED

THAT THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007. THE COMPANY'S INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, KPMG

93

LLP,

HAS ISSUED AN ATTESTATION REPORT ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING APPEARS ON PAGE 92 OF THIS

FORM 10-K.

AFFECT, THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

ITEM 11. EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

COMPENSATION DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS

A.    EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

THIS

SECTION EXPLAINS APPLE'S EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM AS IT RELATES TO THE FOLLOWING "NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS:"

STEVE JOBS

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER

TIM COOK

CHIEF OPERATING OFFICER

PETER OPPENHEIMER

SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER

RON JOHNSON

SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, RETAIL SALES

TONY FADELL

SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, IPOD DIVISION

APPLE'S

EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS CONSISTS OF LONG-TERM EQUITY AWARDS IN THE FORM OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS ("RSUS") AND CASH COMPENSATION IN THE FORM

OF PERFORMANCE-BASED CASH INCENTIVES AND BASE SALARIES. EACH YEAR, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, WHICH IS MADE UP ENTIRELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS, DETERMINES THE COMPENSATION FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS.

APPLE

RELIES HEAVILY ON LONG-TERM EQUITY AWARDS TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN AN OUTSTANDING EXECUTIVE TEAM AND TO ENSURE A STRONG CONNECTION BETWEEN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE. AN RSU AWARD GIVES THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE, AT NO COST, A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF SHARES OF APPLE COMMON STOCK WHEN THE AWARD VESTS, TYPICALLY AT INTERVALS OF TWO TO

FOUR YEARS. BECAUSE THE VALUE OF THE RSUS DEPENDS ON APPLE'S FUTURE SHARE PRICE, THE AWARD LINKS COMPENSATION TO FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THE OFFICER IS GENERALLY NOT ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE THE

SHARES IF EMPLOYMENT IS TERMINATED BEFORE THE RSUS VEST. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REVIEWS ANNUALLY THE OUTSTANDING, UNVESTED EQUITY AWARDS OF EACH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO DETERMINE, IN THE

COMMITTEE'S DISCRETION, WHETHER ADDITIONAL AWARDS ARE WARRANTED IN LIGHT OF THE OFFICER'S PERFORMANCE, THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT AND THE OTHER FACTORS DISCUSSED IN SECTION D3 BELOW.

THE

PERFORMANCE-BASED CASH INCENTIVES COMPENSATE THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FOR ACHIEVING SPECIFIC FINANCIAL GOALS ESTABLISHED ANNUALLY BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE, AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION D4. THE

COMMITTEE SETS AGGRESSIVE PERFORMANCE GOALS EACH YEAR BASED ON THE REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME OBJECTIVES IN APPLE'S INTERNAL BUSINESS PLAN. PAYMENTS ARE NOT AUTOMATIC, HOWEVER, BECAUSE THE

COMMITTEE MAY EXERCISE ITS DISCRETION TO REDUCE (BUT NOT INCREASE) THE AMOUNT OF ANY INCENTIVE PAYMENT BASED ON AN OFFICER'S OVERALL PERFORMANCE.

BASED

ON THE FACTORS DISCUSSED IN SECTION D3 BELOW AND THE COMMITTEE'S BELIEF THAT THE OUTSTANDING, UNVESTED EQUITY AWARDS STILL HAD SIGNIFICANT RETENTION VALUE, THE COMMITTEE MADE NO NEW EQUITY

AWARDS TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN FISCAL 2007. THE OFFICERS EARNED CASH INCENTIVES IN FISCAL 2007 AT THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT ALLOWED BY THE PLAN100% OF BASE SALARYBECAUSE

APPLE'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED THE ANNUAL PERFORMANCE GOALS SET BY THE COMMITTEE. THE COMMITTEE ASSESSED BOTH THE AMOUNT AND ALLOCATION OF THE COMPENSATION COMPONENTS FOR EACH

OFFICER BASED ON APPLE'S OVERALL ANNUAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND EACH OFFICER'S INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE. THE COMMITTEE DID NOT INCREASE BASE SALARIES FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS BECAUSE IT

CONCLUDED THAT THE TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR EACH OFFICER WAS APPROPRIATE.

99

APPLE'S

SHAREHOLDERS HAVE BEEN GENEROUSLY REWARDED FOR APPLE'S SUCCESS, WITH A THREE-YEAR ANNUALIZED SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF 101% THROUGH THE END OF FISCAL 2007. THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THE

COMPENSATION OF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAS BEEN APPROPRIATE AND FAIR IN LIGHT OF APPLE'S PERFORMANCE.

B.    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES

APPLE'S

GOAL FOR EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION IS SIMPLE: ATTRACT AND RETAIN AN EXCEPTIONALLY TALENTED, ENTREPRENEURIAL AND CREATIVE TEAM OF EXECUTIVES WHO WILL PROVIDE THE LEADERSHIP FOR APPLE'S SUCCESS IN

DYNAMIC, HIGHLY-COMPETITIVE MARKETS.

C.    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION OVERVIEW

1.

THREE COMPONENTS

THE

COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS CONSISTS OF THE FOLLOWING THREE COMPONENTS, IN ORDER OF THEIR IMPORTANCE.



LONG-TERM

EQUITY AWARDS IN THE FORM OF RSUS UNDER THE SHAREHOLDER-APPROVED EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN

2.

MIX OF EQUITY, CASH INCENTIVES AND SALARY

APPLE

RELIES HEAVILY ON LONG-TERM EQUITY AWARDS BECAUSE THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE BELIEVES THEY ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE COMPENSATION ELEMENT FOR ATTRACTING ENTREPRENEURIAL, CREATIVE

EXECUTIVES AND PROMOTING THEIR LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO APPLE. AN RSU AWARD GENERALLY VESTS ONLY IF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER CONTINUES EMPLOYMENT UNTIL THE SPECIFIED VESTING DATE,

TYPICALLY TWO TO FOUR YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT. EQUITY AWARDS ALSO HELP TO ENSURE A STRONG CONNECTION BETWEEN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION AND APPLE'S FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BECAUSE THE VALUE OF RSUS

DEPENDS ON APPLE'S FUTURE SHARE PRICE.

ALTHOUGH

THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REVIEWS THE COMPENSATION PRACTICES OF ITS PEER COMPANIES AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION D6 BELOW, THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT ADHERE TO STRICT FORMULAS OR SURVEY DATA TO

DETERMINE THE MIX OF COMPENSATION ELEMENTS. INSTEAD, AS DESCRIBED IN SECTION D, THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERS VARIOUS FACTORS IN EXERCISING ITS DISCRETION TO DETERMINE COMPENSATION, INCLUDING THE

EXPERIENCE, RESPONSIBILITIES AND PERFORMANCE OF EACH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER AS WELL AS APPLE'S OVERALL

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. THIS FLEXIBILITY IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT IN DESIGNING COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS TO ATTRACT NEW EXECUTIVES IN HIGHLY-COMPETITIVE, RAPIDLY CHANGING MARKETS.

CEO COMPENSATION

APPLE'S

CEO, STEVE JOBS, CURRENTLY HOLDS APPROXIMATELY 5.5 MILLION SHARES OF APPLE COMMON STOCK. SINCE REJOINING APPLE IN 1997, MR. JOBS HAS NEVER SOLD A SHARE OF APPLE STOCK. HIS LAST

EQUITY GRANT WAS AWARDED IN 2003, AND VESTED IN FULL IN 2006. MR. JOBS CURRENTLY HOLDS NO UNVESTED EQUITY AWARDS. IN FISCAL 2007, MR. JOBS'S ENTIRE COMPENSATION CONSISTED OF HIS $1

ANNUAL SALARY. BECAUSE MR. JOBS'S CONTINUED LEADERSHIP IS CRITICAL TO APPLE, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE IS CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS FOR HIM.

MR. JOBS

HAS RECEIVED A $1 ANNUAL SALARY SINCE HE REJOINED APPLE IN 1997 AND BEGAN SERVING AS INTERIM CEO. IN 1999, APPLE AWARDED MR. JOBS AN AIRCRAFT AS AN EXECUTIVE BONUS IN

RECOGNITION OF HIS OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE DURING THE PREVIOUS TWO YEARS. MR. JOBS ALSO RECEIVED TWO STOCK OPTION GRANTS, ONE IN 2000 AND ANOTHER IN 2001. MR. JOBS NEVER EXERCISED THESE

GRANTS, AND THEY WERE BOTH CANCELLED IN MARCH 2003, WHEN APPLE AWARDED MR. JOBS A GRANT OF 5 MILLION SHARES OF RESTRICTED STOCK.

THE

2003 RESTRICTED STOCK GRANT REQUIRED MR. JOBS TO REMAIN EMPLOYED BY APPLE FOR THREE MORE YEARS BEFORE IT VESTED. THIS GRANT, WHICH INCREASED TO 10 MILLION SHARES WHEN APPLE'S COMMON

STOCK SPLIT IN 2005, VESTED IN FULL IN MARCH 2006. AFTER A PORTION OF THESE SHARES WAS WITHHELD FOR THE PAYMENT OF TAXES, MR. JOBS RECEIVED THE REMAINING 5,426,447 SHARES. DUE IN LARGE

PART TO MR. JOBS'S LEADERSHIP, APPLE'S STOCK PRICE (AFTER ACCOUNTING FOR A STOCK SPLIT) INCREASED FROM $7.47 ON THE MARCH 2003 GRANT DATE TO $64.66 ON THE MARCH 2006 VESTING

DATEMORE THAN AN EIGHT-FOLD INCREASE IN THREE YEARS. UNDER MR. JOBS'S CONTINUED LEADERSHIP, APPLE'S STOCK PRICE INCREASED FROM $64.66 PER SHARE IN MARCH 2006 TO

$189.95 PER SHARE AS OF OCTOBER 31, 2007A THREE-FOLD INCREASE IN APPROXIMATELY 18 MONTHS.

WHEN

HE WAS ELECTED TO APPLE'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN 1997, MR. JOBS RECEIVED THE STANDARD DIRECTOR'S STOCK OPTION GRANT FOR 30,000 SHARES. BECAUSE MR. JOBS BECAME EMPLOYED LATER THAT

YEAR AS APPLE'S INTERIM CEO, HE WAS NO LONGER ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH DIRECTOR GRANTS. WHEN THE 1997 DIRECTOR GRANT (WHICH INCREASED TO 120,000 SHARES AFTER TWO STOCK SPLITS) WAS DUE TO EXPIRE IN

AUGUST 2007, MR. JOBS EXERCISED THE OPTION AND HE CURRENTLY HOLDS THESE 120,000 SHARES.

D.    EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

1.

TEAM-BASED COMPENSATION

THE

COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS RESTS ON TWO ASSUMPTIONS. FIRST, EACH OFFICER MUST DEMONSTRATE EXCEPTIONAL PERSONAL PERFORMANCE IN ORDER TO REMAIN PART OF THE EXECUTIVE

TEAM. SECOND, EACH OFFICER MUST CONTRIBUTE AS A MEMBER OF THE TEAM TO APPLE'S OVERALL SUCCESS RATHER THAN MERELY ACHIEVE SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES WITHIN THAT OFFICER'S AREA OF RESPONSIBILITY.

2.

INDEPENDENT COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES ALL EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION

THE

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE DETERMINES ALL COMPENSATION FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. ALL THREE COMMITTEE MEMBERS ARE INDEPENDENT OF APPLE'S MANAGEMENT.

101

DURING

THE FIRST QUARTER OF EACH FISCAL YEAR, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE CONDUCTS AN EVALUATION OF EACH NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO DETERMINE IF ANY CHANGES IN THE OFFICER'S COMPENSATION ARE

APPROPRIATE BASED ON THE CONSIDERATIONS DESCRIBED BELOW. THE CEO DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE COMMITTEE'S DELIBERATIONS OR DECISION WITH REGARD TO HIS COMPENSATION. AT THE COMMITTEE'S REQUEST, THE CEO

REVIEWS WITH THE COMMITTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THE OTHER FOUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, BUT NO OTHER NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER HAS ANY INPUT INTO EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION DECISIONS. THE COMMITTEE GIVES

CONSIDERABLE WEIGHT TO THE CEO'S EVALUATION OF THE OTHER NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS BECAUSE OF HIS DIRECT KNOWLEDGE OF EACH OFFICER'S PERFORMANCE AND CONTRIBUTIONS. FOR EACH OFFICER, THE COMMITTEE

MEMBERS INDEPENDENTLY DETERMINE EACH COMPONENT OF COMPENSATION BASED ON THEIR COLLECTIVE ASSESSMENT OF THE OFFICER'S PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS APPLE'S OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

3.

THE CRUCIAL ROLE OF LONG-TERM EQUITY AWARDS

OVERVIEW.

THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT LONG-TERM EQUITY AWARDS ARE THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN A SUPERLATIVE

EXECUTIVE TEAM. ACCORDINGLY, EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION IS HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD LONG-TERM EQUITY AWARDS RATHER THAN CASH COMPENSATION, AND THE AWARDS HAVE LONG VESTING INTERVALS TO MAXIMIZE

THEIR RETENTION VALUE. THIS APPROACH IS REFLECTED IN THE FOLLOWING.



THE

CEO'S COMPENSATION HAS BEEN GENERALLY TIED TO LONG-TERM EQUITY; FOR EXAMPLE, HIS LAST EQUITY AWARD DID NOT VEST FOR THREE YEARS.



FOR

THE OTHER FOUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, EQUITY AWARDS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 85% OF THEIR TARGET TOTAL COMPENSATION IN FISCAL 2007. THIS COMPARES TO APPROXIMATELY

70% AT APPLE'S PEER COMPANIES.



FISCAL

2004 EQUITY AWARDS VESTED 50% ON THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRANT DATE; THE REMAINING 50% WILL VEST ON THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRANT DATE.



FISCAL

2006 EQUITY AWARDS DO NOT VEST AT ALL UNTIL 2010, WHEN THEY VEST IN FULL.

IN

DESIGNING LONG-TERM EQUITY AWARDS, THE COMMITTEE SEEKS TO MAXIMIZE THEIR EFFECTIVENESS IN ACCOMPLISHING APPLE'S COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES WHILE RECOGNIZING THE BOARD'S DUTY TO APPLE'S

SHAREHOLDERS TO LIMIT EQUITY DILUTION. THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THIS BALANCE HAS BEEN ACHIEVED AS FOLLOWS.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS MINIMIZE DILUTION AND SUPPORT LONG-TERM FOCUS.

SINCE FISCAL 2004, ALL EQUITY AWARDS TO THE NAMED

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE BEEN RSUS RATHER THAN STOCK OPTIONS. A GRANT OF RSUS GIVES AN OFFICER THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE A SPECIFIED NUMBER OF SHARES OF APPLE COMMON STOCK, AT NO COST TO THE OFFICER, IF THE

OFFICER REMAINS EMPLOYED AT APPLE UNTIL THE RSUS VEST. RSUS GRANTED IN 2004 ALSO PROVIDE FOR ACCELERATED VESTING IF THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER IS TERMINATED WITHOUT CAUSE OR ON A CHANGE OF CONTROL,

RSUS GRANTED BEFORE 2007 PROVIDE FOR ACCELERATED VESTING ON A CHANGE OF CONTROL, AND ALL RSUS PROVIDE FOR ACCELERATED VESTING UPON THE DEATH OF THE OFFICER. THE COMPENSATION VALUE OF AN RSU DOES NOT

DEPEND SOLELY ON FUTURE STOCK PRICE INCREASES; AT GRANT, ITS VALUE IS EQUAL TO APPLE'S STOCK PRICE. ALTHOUGH ITS VALUE MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITH CHANGES IN THE STOCK PRICE DURING THE PERIOD BEFORE

VESTING, AN RSU WILL HAVE VALUE IN THE LONG TERM, ENCOURAGING RETENTION. BY CONTRAST, THE ENTIRE COMPENSATION VALUE OF A STOCK OPTION DEPENDS ON FUTURE STOCK PRICE APPRECIATION. ACCORDINGLY, RSUS CAN

DELIVER SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER SHARE-FOR-SHARE COMPENSATION VALUE AT GRANT THAN STOCK OPTIONS, AND APPLE CAN OFFER COMPARABLE GRANT DATE COMPENSATION VALUE WITH FEWER SHARES AND

LESS DILUTION FOR ITS SHAREHOLDERS.

LONG VESTING INTERVALS TO MAXIMIZE RETENTION.

ALL VESTING OF RSUS IS GENERALLY SUBJECT TO CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. EXCEPT FOR OCCASIONAL NEW

HIRE GRANTS, VESTING OCCURS AT INTERVALS OF NO

102

LESS

THAN TWO YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE. THIS ENSURES THAT A MEANINGFUL PORTION OF A NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S AWARDS WILL VEST EVERY TWO YEARSA STRONG INCENTIVE TO CONTINUE EMPLOYMENT

WITH APPLE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE GRANT AND VESTING PATTERNS FOR ONGOING RSU GRANTS FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS SINCE FISCAL 2004 (EXCLUDING THOSE WHO WERE NOT NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AT

THE TIME OF GRANT).

VESTING CONDITIONS.

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE VESTING OF ALL RSUS IS GENERALLY CONTINGENT ON THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT

WITH APPLE, RATHER THAN ON PERFORMANCE WITH REGARD TO SPECIFIC BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS CONSIDERED VARIOUS FORMS OF PERFORMANCE-BASED VESTING. AFTER

CAREFUL EVALUATION, THE COMMITTEE HAS CONCLUDED THAT PERFORMANCE-BASED VESTING WOULD NOT SERVE APPLE'S CURRENT OBJECTIVES AS EFFECTIVELY AS THE PROGRAM DESCRIBED ABOVE. THE COMMITTEE GENERALLY GRANTS

RSUS WITH TWO TO FOUR YEAR VESTING PERIODS TO MAXIMIZE THE AWARD'S RETENTION VALUE. THIS RETENTION VALUE WOULD BE UNDERMINED IF A NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S EQUITY AWARDS (WHICH REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY

85% OF THE OFFICER'S COMPENSATION) WERE AT RISK BASED ON PERFORMANCE MEASURES THAT WERE DETERMINED TWO OR EVEN FOUR YEARS PRIOR TO THE VESTING DATE. GIVEN THE INTENSELY DYNAMIC BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT IN

WHICH APPLE OPERATES, IT WOULD BE EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO CRAFT MEANINGFUL OBJECTIVES WITH SUCH A LONG HORIZON. APPLE IMPOSES NO REQUIREMENT THAT THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HOLD THEIR COMMON STOCK

FOR ANY PERIOD AFTER VESTING.

ANNUAL BURN RATE AVERAGES LESS THAN 2.5%.

IN FISCAL 2005, APPLE COMMITTED TO AN ANNUAL "BURN RATE" (THE TOTAL NUMBER OF ALL EQUITY AWARD

SHARES GRANTED DURING THE FISCAL YEAR DIVIDED BY THE TOTAL SHARES OUTSTANDING AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR) OF 2.5% FROM FISCAL 2005 THROUGH FISCAL 2007. THIS COMMITMENT REPRESENTED A SIGNIFICANT

REDUCTION FROM AN AVERAGE BURN RATE OF 4.8% FROM FISCAL 2002 THROUGH FISCAL 2004. IN FACT, APPLE'S AVERAGE ANNUAL BURN RATE FROM FISCAL 2005 THROUGH FISCAL 2007 WAS APPROXIMATELY 1.6%.

OVERHANG FROM EQUITY PLANS AT 12.9%.

OVERHANG (GRANTED AND OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS PLUS SHARES RESERVED FOR FUTURE AWARDS, DIVIDED BY THE

SUM OF TOTAL SHARES OUTSTANDING, GRANTED AND OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS, AND SHARES RESERVED FOR FUTURE AWARDS) IS ANOTHER MEASURE OF EQUITY DILUTION. THE EFFICIENT USE OF EQUITY AWARDS, COMBINED WITH

THE SUBSTANTIAL EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN APPLE'S STOCK PRICE OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, HAS CAUSED APPLE'S OVERHANG TO DECLINE FROM APPROXIMATELY 14.5% AT

THE END OF FISCAL 2005 TO APPROXIMATELY 12.9% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007.

FREQUENCY AND SIZE OF EQUITY AWARDS.

THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS TYPICALLY RECEIVE EQUITY AWARDS EVERY TWO YEARS, RATHER THAN EVERY YEAR.

THIS PRACTICE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE LONG TIME HORIZON AND LENGTHY VESTING PERIODS OF THE AWARDS. BY MAKING AWARDS LESS FREQUENTLY, THE COMMITTEE CAN PROVIDE LARGER GRANTS, WHICH IN TURN PROMOTES

GREATER RETENTION.

TO

DETERMINE THE SIZE OF RSU GRANTS, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE FIRST ESTABLISHES A TARGET COMPENSATION VALUE THAT IT WANTS TO DELIVER TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS THROUGH LONG-TERM

EQUITY AWARDS. IN DOING SO, THE COMMITTEE CONSIDERS VARIOUS FACTORS, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.



THE

PRACTICE OF GRANTING EQUITY ONLY EVERY TWO YEARS



THE

HEAVY WEIGHT PLACED ON EQUITY IN THE MIX OF TOTAL COMPENSATION

103



THE

OFFICER'S EXPERIENCE AND PERFORMANCE



THE

SCOPE, RESPONSIBILITY AND BUSINESS IMPACT OF THE OFFICER'S POSITION



THE

PERCEIVED RETENTION VALUE OF THE TOTAL COMPENSATION PACKAGE IN LIGHT OF THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT

ONCE

THE TARGET VALUE HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED, THE COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE NUMBER OF SHARES BY REFERENCE TO THE CURRENT VALUE OF APPLE'S COMMON STOCK.

4.

THE MINOR ROLE OF CASH COMPENSATION

BASE SALARIES.

THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT BASE SALARIES ARE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS IMPORTANT THAN PERFORMANCE-BASED BONUSES AND

LONG-TERM EQUITY AWARDS IN MEETING APPLE'S COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES. THE MINOR ROLE OF SALARIES AS PART OF TOTAL COMPENSATION IS REFLECTED IN THE FOLLOWING.



THE

CEO HAS RECEIVED AN ANNUAL BASE SALARY OF $1 SINCE REJOINING APPLE IN 1997.



THE

FISCAL 2007 AVERAGE BASE SALARY FOR THE OTHER NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WAS BELOW MEDIAN AMONG THE PEER COMPANIES SHOWN IN SECTION D6, DESPITE APPLE'S

SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER FINANCIAL AND BUSINESS SUCCESS.



BASE

SALARIES FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS HAVE NOT INCREASED SINCE OCTOBER 2005, EXCEPT FOR A PROMOTION-RELATED INCREASE FOR ONE OFFICER.

PERFORMANCE-BASED CASH INCENTIVES.

THE PERFORMANCE BONUS PLAN, WHICH HAS BEEN APPROVED BY APPLE'S SHAREHOLDERS, AUTHORIZES THE COMMITTEE TO

ISSUE PLAN-BASED CASH INCENTIVE AWARDS TO COMPENSATE OFFICERS FOR ACHIEVING SPECIFIC FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES THAT ARE ESTABLISHED ANNUALLY. THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT PERFORMANCE-BASED CASH

COMPENSATION IS AN IMPORTANT COMPONENT OF EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION; HOWEVER, IT REPRESENTS A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL COMPENSATION BECAUSE ITS EFFECTIVENESS IN MEETING APPLE'S COMPENSATION OBJECTIVES

IS LIMITED. IT IS A LESS SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN ATTRACTING NEW EXECUTIVE TALENT THAN EQUITY COMPENSATION, AND IT PROMOTES RETENTION ONLY IN THE SHORT-TERMOVER THE PERFORMANCE

PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, THE PLAN IS MODESTLY FUNDED, AS REFLECTED BY THE FOLLOWING.



THE

CEO DOES NOT PARTICIPATE IN THE PERFORMANCE BONUS PLAN.



APPLE'S

TARGET PAYOUT OF 50% OF BASE SALARY IS SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER THAN PEER COMPANIES AS A GROUP, WHERE MEDIAN TARGET BONUS PAYOUTS RANGE FROM 100% TO 160% OF BASE SALARY.



THE

MAXIMUM PAYOUT OF 100% FOR EXCEPTIONAL PERFORMANCE IS ALSO LOWER THAN PEER COMPANIES, WHERE 3 TIMES THE TARGET RANGE (I.E., 300% TO 480% OF BASE SALARY) IS

BECOMING INCREASINGLY COMMON.

THE

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE ESTABLISHES PERFORMANCE GOALS EACH YEAR BASED ON REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME OBJECTIVES IN APPLE'S INTERNAL BUSINESS PLAN. THE COMMITTEE HAS SELECTED THESE PERFORMANCE

GOALS BECAUSE THEY ARE IMPORTANT INDICATORS OF INCREASED SHAREHOLDER VALUE. THESE PERFORMANCE GOALS GENERALLY EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF EXTRAORDINARY, UNUSUAL OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING EVENTS OR CHANGES

IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. APPLE DOES NOT PUBLICLY DISCLOSE SPECIFIC ANNUAL INTERNAL REVENUE OR OPERATING INCOME OBJECTIVES, AS ITS BUSINESS PLAN IS HIGHLY CONFIDENTIAL. DISCLOSING SPECIFIC OBJECTIVES

WOULD PROVIDE COMPETITORS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES WITH INSIGHTS INTO THE PLANNING PROCESS AND WOULD THEREFORE CAUSE COMPETITIVE HARM.

THE

COMMITTEE NEXT DETERMINES THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT OF ANY CASH INCENTIVE PAYMENT DENOMINATED AS A PERCENTAGE OF BASE SALARY. THE CURRENT PAYMENT STRUCTURE IS SHOWN IN THE PAYOUT MATRIX BELOW. ONCE THE

PERFORMANCE GOALS AND PAYMENT STRUCTURE ARE ESTABLISHED, NO ONE HAS THE AUTHORITY TO MODIFY OR WAIVE THEM.

THE

PERFORMANCE GOALS ARE AGGRESSIVE. THUS, THERE IS CONSIDERABLE RISK THAT PAYMENTS WILL NOT BE MADE AT ALL OR WILL BE MADE AT LESS THAN 100%. FOR THE PAST THREE YEARS, THE PERFORMANCE GOALS HAVE

REFLECTED DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN BOTH REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME. IN FOUR OF THE PAST EIGHT YEARS, APPLE DID

NOT MEET ONE OR BOTH PERFORMANCE GOALS. THIS UNCERTAINTY ENSURES THAT ANY PAYMENTS UNDER THE PLAN ARE TRULY PERFORMANCE-BASED, CONSISTENT WITH THE PLAN'S OBJECTIVES.

AT

THE END OF THE YEAR, THE COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE AMOUNT OF THE AWARD TO BE PAID TO EACH OFFICER BY COMPARING ACTUAL RESULTS TO THE PERFORMANCE GOALS. THE COMMITTEE MAY, IN ITS DISCRETION, REDUCE

(BUT NOT INCREASE) THE AMOUNT OF ANY INDIVIDUAL AWARD BASED ON THE OFFICER'S OVERALL PERFORMANCE. THE PLAN DOES NOT PROVIDE FOR THE ADJUSTMENT OR RECOVERY OF AN AWARD PAID TO A NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER

IF THE RESULTS IN A PREVIOUS YEAR ARE SUBSEQUENTLY RESTATED OR ADJUSTED IN A MANNER THAT WOULD HAVE ORIGINALLY RESULTED IN A SMALLER AWARD.

5.

THE ROLE OF CONSULTANTS

THE

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS SELECTED AND DIRECTLY RETAINED THE SERVICES OF FREDERIC W. COOK & CO., INC., AN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION CONSULTING FIRM. NO MEMBER OF THE

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OR ANY NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER HAS ANY AFFILIATION WITH F.W. COOK. THE COMMITTEE PERIODICALLY SEEKS INPUT FROM F.W. COOK ON A RANGE OF EXTERNAL MARKET FACTORS,

INCLUDING EVOLVING COMPENSATION TRENDS, APPROPRIATE COMPARISON COMPANIES AND MARKET SURVEY DATA. F.W. COOK ALSO PROVIDES GENERAL OBSERVATIONS ON APPLE'S COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, BUT IT DOES NOT

DETERMINE OR RECOMMEND THE AMOUNT OR FORM OF COMPENSATION FOR ANY EXECUTIVES.

6.

THE ROLE OF PEER GROUPS, SURVEYS AND BENCHMARKING

WITH

THE ASSISTANCE OF F.W. COOK, THE COMMITTEE IDENTIFIED PEER COMPANIES FOR FISCAL 2007 THAT COMPETE WITH APPLE IN THE LABOR AND CAPITAL MARKETS AND THAT FOLLOW SIMILAR PAY MODELS. THE COMMITTEE

ESTABLISHED THE TWO PEER GROUPS LISTED BELOW, ONE CONSISTING OF LARGE TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES AND ANOTHER CONSISTING OF LARGE RETAILERS. THE RETAIL PEER GROUP IS A RELEVANT COMPARISON GROUP FOR THE

SENIOR VICE PRESIDENT, RETAIL SALES; THE TECHNOLOGY PEER GROUP IS RELEVANT FOR THE OTHER FOUR NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

THE

COMMITTEE REVIEWS COMPENSATION PRACTICES AT PEER COMPANIES (GATHERED FROM SEC FILINGS AND THE RADFORD HIGH TECHNOLOGY COMPENSATION SURVEY) AT A HIGH LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT APPLE'S TOTAL COMPENSATION

IS WITHIN A REASONABLY COMPETITIVE RANGE. THE COMMITTEE, HOWEVER, DOES NOT ATTEMPT TO SET COMPENSATION COMPONENTS TO MEET SPECIFIC BENCHMARKS, SUCH AS SALARIES "ABOVE THE MEDIAN" OR EQUITY

COMPENSATION "AT THE 75

TH

PERCENTILE." FURTHERMORE, THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES THAT EXCESSIVE RELIANCE ON BENCHMARKING IS DETRIMENTAL TO SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS BECAUSE IT CAN RESULT IN

COMPENSATION THAT IS UNRELATED TO THE VALUE DELIVERED BY THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

7.

TAX AND ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS

TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

SECTION 162(M) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE PLACES A LIMIT OF $1,000,000 ON THE AMOUNT OF

COMPENSATION TO CERTAIN OFFICERS THAT MAY BE DEDUCTED BY APPLE AS A BUSINESS EXPENSE IN ANY TAX YEAR UNLESS, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE COMPENSATION IS PERFORMANCE-BASED AND HAS BEEN APPROVED BY THE

SHAREHOLDERS. TO QUALIFY AS PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION, THE AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION MUST DEPEND ON THE OFFICER'S PERFORMANCE AGAINST PRE-DETERMINED PERFORMANCE GOALS ESTABLISHED BY A

COMMITTEE THAT CONSISTS SOLELY OF AT LEAST TWO "OUTSIDE" DIRECTORS WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN EMPLOYED BY APPLE OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES. TWO COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS, MR. GORE AND

MR. DREXLER, QUALIFY AS OUTSIDE DIRECTORS UNDER THE IRS DEFINITION. ALTHOUGH MR. CAMPBELL IS AN INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR UNDER SEC AND NASDAQ GOVERNANCE STANDARDS, HE DOES NOT QUALIFY AS AN

OUTSIDE DIRECTOR BECAUSE HE WAS AN OFFICER OF APPLE FROM 1983 TO 1987 AND AN APPLE SUBSIDIARY FROM 1987 TO 1991. FOR THIS REASON, HE DOES NOT DISCUSS OR VOTE ON ANY SECTION 162(M)-RELATED

MATTERS.

SALARIES

FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS DO NOT QUALIFY AS PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION. APPLE'S PERFORMANCE-BASED CASH INCENTIVES, HOWEVER, ARE EXEMPT FROM THE SECTION 162(M) LIMIT BECAUSE

THEY ARE PAID BASED ON PREDETERMINED GOALS ESTABLISHED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE PURSUANT TO THE SHAREHOLDER-APPROVED PERFORMANCE BONUS PLAN. THE RSUS DO NOT QUALIFY AS PERFORMANCE-BASED

COMPENSATION FOR PURPOSES OF SECTION 162(M) BECAUSE VESTING IS BASED ON CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT RATHER THAN SPECIFIC PERFORMANCE GOALS. SEE PAGE 103 FOR AN EXPLANATION OF APPLE'S DECISION

NOT TO IMPLEMENT PERFORMANCE-BASED VESTING.

TAX IMPLICATIONS FOR OFFICERS.

SECTION 409A OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE IMPOSES ADDITIONAL INCOME TAXES ON EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FOR

CERTAIN TYPES OF DEFERRED COMPENSATION THAT DO NOT COMPLY WITH SECTION 409A. BECAUSE APPLE DOES NOT GENERALLY PROVIDE DEFERRED COMPENSATION TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, THIS LIMITATION HAS

NO IMPACT ON THE STRUCTURE OF THE COMPENSATION PROGRAM FOR THE OFFICERS. SECTION 280G OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE IMPOSES AN EXCISE TAX ON PAYMENTS TO EXECUTIVES OF SEVERANCE OR CHANGE OF

CONTROL COMPENSATION THAT EXCEED THE LEVELS SPECIFIED IN SECTION 280G. THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS COULD RECEIVE THE AMOUNTS SHOWN ON THE TABLE ON PAGE 113 AS SEVERANCE OR CHANGE OF

CONTROL PAYMENTS, BUT THE COMMITTEE DOES NOT CONSIDER THEIR POTENTIAL IMPACT IN COMPENSATION PROGRAM DESIGN.

ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS.

THE COMMITTEE ALSO CONSIDERS THE ACCOUNTING AND CASH FLOW IMPLICATIONS OF VARIOUS FORMS OF EXECUTIVE

COMPENSATION. IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, APPLE RECORDS SALARIES AND PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION INCENTIVES AS EXPENSES IN THE AMOUNT PAID, OR TO BE PAID, TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS.

ACCOUNTING RULES ALSO REQUIRE APPLE TO RECORD AN EXPENSE IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EQUITY AWARDS, EVEN THOUGH EQUITY AWARDS ARE NOT PAID AS CASH TO EMPLOYEES. THE ACCOUNTING EXPENSE OF EQUITY

AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES IS CALCULATED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 123R. THE COMMITTEE BELIEVES, HOWEVER, THAT THE MANY ADVANTAGES OF EQUITY COMPENSATION, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, MORE THAN COMPENSATE FOR

THE NON-CASH ACCOUNTING EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THEM.

106

E.    FISCAL 2007 COMPENSATION DECISIONS

1.

NO EQUITY GRANTS OR SALARY CHANGES

IN

FISCAL 2007, THE COMMITTEE DID NOT GRANT NEW EQUITY AWARDS OR INCREASE BASE SALARIES FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. BASED ON ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE FACTORS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND THE COMMITTEE'S

BELIEF THAT THE OUTSTANDING, UNVESTED EQUITY GRANTS AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2007 HAD SIGNIFICANT RETENTION VALUE, THE COMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPENSATION PACKAGES FOR THE NAMED EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS WERE REASONABLE WITHOUT ADDITIONAL EQUITY AWARDS. THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY GRANTS AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007 ARE SHOWN ON THE OUTSTANDING EQUITY AWARDS TABLE ON PAGES 110 AND 111. BASED

ON A REVIEW OF COMPETITIVE PRACTICES AND THE COMMITTEE'S APPROACH TO PLACE LESS EMPHASIS ON CASH COMPENSATION, THE COMMITTEE CONCLUDED THAT THE TOTAL COMPENSATION FOR THE OFFICERS WERE APPROPRIATE FOR

FISCAL 2007 WITHOUT A SALARY INCREASE.

2.

2007 PERFORMANCE-BASED CASH INCENTIVE PLAN PAYMENTS

APPLE'S

FISCAL 2007 PERFORMANCE SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDED THE REVENUE AND OPERATING INCOME GOALS ESTABLISHED UNDER THE CASH INCENTIVE PLAN, SO THE COMMITTEE, IN THE EXERCISE OF ITS DISCRETION, APPROVED

PAYOUTS TO THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AT THE MAXIMUM OF 100% OF BASE SALARY, PURSUANT TO THE PAYOUT MATRIX ON PAGE 105. THE SPECIFIC PAYMENT AMOUNTS ARE SHOWN IN THE SUMMARY COMPENSATION

TABLE AT PAGE 108.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT(1)

THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS CERTAIN DUTIES AND POWERS AS DESCRIBED IN ITS CHARTER. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE IS CURRENTLY COMPOSED OF THE THREE NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS NAMED AT THE END

POTENTIAL PAYMENTS UPON TERMINATION OR CHANGE IN CONTROL

AS NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH ANY OF ITS NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, NOR DOES THE COMPANY MAINTAIN ANY OTHER PLANS OR ARRANGEMENTS THAT

PROVIDE FOR ANY NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICER TO RECEIVE CASH SEVERANCE OR OTHER CASH PAYMENTS IN CONNECTION WITH A TERMINATION OF THEIR EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY AND/OR A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE

COMPANY.

EFFECTIVE

FOR GRANTS MADE AFTER APRIL 9, 2007, THE COMPANY'S 2003 EMPLOYEE STOCK PLAN (THE "2003 PLAN") WAS AMENDED TO ELIMINATE ACCELERATED VESTING OF OUTSTANDING AWARDS IN CONNECTION WITH A

CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY. WITH RESPECT TO AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE 2003 PLAN PRIOR TO THAT DATE, SUCH AWARDS, TO THE EXTENT THEN OUTSTANDING AND UNVESTED, WILL GENERALLY BECOME FULLY VESTED

AND, IN THE CASE OF OPTIONS, EXERCISABLE UPON A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, UNLESS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE PROVIDES FOR THE SUBSTITUTION, ASSUMPTION, EXCHANGE OR OTHER CONTINUATION OF SUCH

AWARDS. ANY OPTIONS THAT BECOME VESTED IN CONNECTION WITH A CHANGE IN CONTROL GENERALLY MUST BE EXERCISED PRIOR TO THE CHANGE IN CONTROL, OR THEY WILL BE CANCELED IN EXCHANGE FOR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE

A CASH PAYMENT IN CONNECTION WITH THE CHANGE IN CONTROL TRANSACTION.

THE

AWARD AGREEMENTS EVIDENCING CERTAIN GRANTS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO THE COMPANY'S NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2005 GENERALLY PROVIDE THAT IF, IN CONNECTION WITH A

CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, THE EXECUTIVE'S EMPLOYMENT IS TERMINATED BY THE COMPANY WITHOUT CAUSE OR BY THE EXECUTIVE FOR GOOD REASON (AS THOSE TERMS ARE DEFINED IN THE APPLICABLE AWARD

AGREEMENT), THE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS THAT ARE THEN OUTSTANDING AND UNVESTED WILL VEST IN FULL.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE LISTS THE NAMED EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND THE ESTIMATED AMOUNTS THEY WOULD HAVE BECOME ENTITLED TO UNDER THE TERMS OF STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS GRANTED TO THEM

UNDER THE 2003 PLAN PRIOR TO APRIL 9, 2007 HAD A CHANGE OF CONTROL OF THE COMPANY OCCURRED ON SEPTEMBER 29,

2007,

UNLESS THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAD PROVIDED FOR THE SUBSTITUTION, ASSUMPTION, EXCHANGE OR OTHER CONTINUATION OF SUCH AWARDS.

COMPENSATION OF DIRECTORS

THE FORM AND AMOUNT OF DIRECTOR COMPENSATION ARE DETERMINED BY THE BOARD AFTER A REVIEW OF RECOMMENDATIONS MADE BY THE NOMINATING COMMITTEE. THE CURRENT PRACTICE OF THE BOARD

IS TO BASE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF A DIRECTOR'S ANNUAL RETAINER ON EQUITY. UNDER THE COMPANY'S 1997 DIRECTOR STOCK OPTION PLAN (THE "DIRECTOR PLAN"), THE COMPANY'S NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS

ARE GRANTED AN OPTION TO ACQUIRE 30,000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK UPON THEIR INITIAL ELECTION TO THE BOARD (AN "INITIAL OPTION"). INITIAL OPTIONS VEST AND BECOME EXERCISABLE IN EQUAL

INSTALLMENTS ON EACH OF THE FIRST THREE ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT DATE. ON THE FOURTH ANNIVERSARY OF A NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTOR'S INITIAL ELECTION TO THE BOARD AND ON EACH SUBSEQUENT

ANNIVERSARY THEREAFTER, THE DIRECTOR IS GRANTED AN OPTION TO ACQUIRE 10,000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK (AN "ANNUAL OPTION"). ANNUAL OPTIONS ARE FULLY VESTED AND IMMEDIATELY EXERCISABLE ON

THE DATE OF GRANT.

UPON

HIS INITIAL APPOINTMENT TO THE BOARD ON AUGUST 29, 2006, DR. SCHMIDT DECLINED THE ANNUAL RETAINER FEE AND THE AUTOMATIC STOCK OPTION GRANT TO PURCHASE 30,000 SHARES TO WHICH NEW

DIRECTORS ARE ENTITLED UNDER THE DIRECTOR PLAN. INSTEAD, DR. SCHMIDT PURCHASED 10,000 SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK ON THE OPEN MARKET.

NON-EMPLOYEE

DIRECTORS ALSO RECEIVE A $50,000 ANNUAL RETAINER PAID IN QUARTERLY INSTALLMENTS. BEGINNING IN THE 2008 FISCAL YEAR, THE CHAIRPERSON OF THE AUDIT AND FINANCE COMMITTEE WILL

ALSO BE ENTITLED TO AN ANNUAL RETAINER OF $25,000, IN ADDITION TO THE ANNUAL RETAINER PAID TO ALL

NON-EMPLOYEE DIRECTORS. DIRECTORS DO NOT RECEIVE ANY ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION FOR SERVING AS A MEMBER OR CHAIRPERSON OF ANY OTHER COMMITTEE. IN ADDITION, DIRECTORS RECEIVE UP TO TWO FREE

COMPUTER SYSTEMS PER YEAR AND ARE ELIGIBLE TO PURCHASE ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT AT A DISCOUNT.

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE INTERLOCKS AND INSIDER PARTICIPATION

THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MEMBERS WHOSE NAMES APPEAR ON THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE REPORT ABOVE WERE COMMITTEE MEMBERS DURING ALL OF FISCAL YEAR 2007. MR. CAMPBELL

FORMERLY SERVED AS AN OFFICER OF THE COMPANY AND OF FILEMAKER, INC., A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY. NO OTHER MEMBER OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE IS OR HAS BEEN A FORMER OR CURRENT EXECUTIVE

OFFICER OF THE COMPANY, AND NO MEMBER OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAD ANY RELATIONSHIPS REQUIRING DISCLOSURE BY THE COMPANY UNDER THE SEC'S RULES REQUIRING DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN RELATIONSHIPS AND

RELATED-PARTY TRANSACTIONS. NONE OF THE COMPANY'S EXECUTIVE OFFICERS SERVED AS A DIRECTOR OR A MEMBER OF A COMPENSATION COMMITTEE (OR OTHER COMMITTEE SERVING AN EQUIVALENT FUNCTION) OF ANY OTHER

POLICY ON AUDIT COMMITTEE PRE-APPROVAL OF AUDIT AND NON-AUDIT SERVICES PERFORMED BY THE INDEPENDENT AUDITORS

NON-FINANCIAL CONSULTING SERVICES, SUCH AS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY CONSULTING AND INTERNAL AUDIT SERVICES. THIS AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE POLICY ALSO MANDATES THAT THE AUDIT AND

NON-AUDIT SERVICES AND RELATED BUDGET BE APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE IN ADVANCE, AND THAT THE AUDIT COMMITTEE BE PROVIDED WITH QUARTERLY REPORTING ON ACTUAL SPENDING. IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THIS POLICY, ALL SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED BY KPMG WERE PRE-APPROVED BY THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.

SUBSEQUENT

TO THE ENACTMENT OF THE ACT, THE AUDIT COMMITTEE MET WITH KPMG TO FURTHER UNDERSTAND THE PROVISIONS OF THE ACT AS IT RELATES TO AUDITOR INDEPENDENCE. KPMG PREVIOUSLY ROTATED THE LEAD AUDIT

PARTNER IN FISCAL YEAR 2005 IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ACT. KPMG ALSO ROTATED OTHER PARTNERS IN 2007 AND 2006, AND WILL ROTATE ADDITIONAL PARTNERS AS APPROPRIATE. THE AUDIT COMMITTEE WILL CONTINUE TO

MONITOR THE ACTIVITIES UNDERTAKEN BY KPMG TO COMPLY WITH THE ACT.
