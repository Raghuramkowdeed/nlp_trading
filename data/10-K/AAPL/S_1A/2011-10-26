ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

BECAUSE OF

THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT

USE HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS POSES A RISK AS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES POSTPONE SPENDING IN RESPONSE TO TIGHTER CREDIT, UNEMPLOYMENT, NEGATIVE FINANCIAL NEWS AND/OR DECLINES IN INCOME OR ASSET VALUES, WHICH COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. DEMAND ALSO COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANYS EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE THE COMPANY GENERALLY RAISES PRICES ON GOODS AND SERVICES SOLD OUTSIDE THE U.S. TO

OFFSET THE EFFECT OF A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD INFLUENCE DEMAND INCLUDE INCREASES IN FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, CONDITIONS IN THE REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE MARKETS, UNEMPLOYMENT, LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, ACCESS

TO CREDIT, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, AND OTHER MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECTING CONSUMER SPENDING BEHAVIOR. THESE AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

IN THE EVENT OF FINANCIAL TURMOIL AFFECTING THE BANKING SYSTEM AND

FINANCIAL MARKETS, ADDITIONAL CONSOLIDATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, OR SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SERVICE INSTITUTION FAILURES, THERE COULD BE A NEW OR INCREMENTAL TIGHTENING IN THE CREDIT MARKETS, LOW LIQUIDITY, AND EXTREME

VOLATILITY IN FIXED INCOME, CREDIT, CURRENCY, AND EQUITY MARKETS. THIS COULD HAVE A NUMBER OF EFFECTS ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE INSOLVENCY OR FINANCIAL INSTABILITY OF OUTSOURCING PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS OR THEIR INABILITY

TO OBTAIN CREDIT TO FINANCE DEVELOPMENT AND/OR MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS RESULTING IN PRODUCT DELAYS; INABILITY OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS, TO OBTAIN CREDIT TO FINANCE PURCHASES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS; AND FAILURE OF

DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE ALSO COULD VARY MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTATIONS DEPENDING ON GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

RESULTING FROM REVALUATIONS OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS; INTEREST RATES; CASH BALANCES; AND

9

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. INCREASED VOLATILITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OVERALL ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WOULD INCREASE THE RISK OF THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS REALIZED IN

THE FUTURE ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIFFERING SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE FAIR VALUES CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO THEM.

GLOBAL MARKETS FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THESE MARKETS, ITS

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

COMPETE IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL MARKETS CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE PRICE CUTTING, WITH RESULTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGINS, FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, SHORT PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CONTINUAL

IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT PRICE/PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS, RAPID ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT ADVANCEMENTS BY COMPETITORS, AND PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY DEPENDS HEAVILY ON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY INTRODUCTION OF

INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT DESIGNS AND DEVELOPS NEARLY THE ENTIRE SOLUTION FOR ITS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE HARDWARE, OPERATING SYSTEM, NUMEROUS SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, AND

RELATED SERVICES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MUST MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND AS SUCH, THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS AND HAS REGISTERED AND/OR HAS APPLIED TO REGISTER

NUMEROUS PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS. BY CONTRAST, MANY OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS SEEK TO COMPETE PRIMARILY THROUGH AGGRESSIVE PRICING AND VERY LOW COST STRUCTURES. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND SELL

INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS WITH ATTRACTIVE MARGINS OR IF OTHER COMPANIES INFRINGE ON THE COMPANYS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED AND ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY MARKETS CERTAIN MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES

BASED ON THE IOS MOBILE OPERATING SYSTEM AND ALSO MARKETS RELATED THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN THESE MARKETS FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND

OTHER RESOURCES, AS WELL AS ESTABLISHED HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND DIGITAL CONTENT SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY FACES SIGNIFICANT PRICE COMPETITION AS COMPETITORS REDUCE THEIR SELLING PRICES AND ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THE COMPANYS

PRODUCT FEATURES AND APPLICATIONS WITHIN THEIR OWN PRODUCTS OR, ALTERNATIVELY, COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER TO OFFER SOLUTIONS THAT ARE MORE COMPETITIVE THAN THOSE THEY CURRENTLY OFFER. THE COMPANY ALSO COMPETES WITH ILLEGITIMATE WAYS TO OBTAIN

THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED THE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA DEVICE MARKETS, AND SOME OF ITS COMPETITORS IN THESE MARKETS HAVE GREATER EXPERIENCE, PRODUCT BREADTH AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAN THE

COMPANY. BECAUSE SOME CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND/OR EXPERIENCE AND A LOWER COST STRUCTURE, THEY MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO PROFIT OR EVEN AT A LOSS. THE COMPANY ALSO

EXPECTS COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS COMPETITORS ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THE COMPANYS APPROACH TO PROVIDING THESE COMPONENTS SEAMLESSLY WITHIN THEIR INDIVIDUAL OFFERINGS OR WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO OFFER INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS. THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY ON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE IOS AND IOS DEVICES IN ORDER TO MAINTAIN THEIR FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN ADVANTAGES.

THE COMPANY IS THE ONLY AUTHORIZED MAKER OF HARDWARE USING MAC OS X, WHICH HAS A MINORITY MARKET SHARE IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET.

THIS MARKET IS DOMINATED BY COMPUTER MAKERS USING COMPETING OPERATING SYSTEMS, MOST NOTABLY WINDOWS. IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND PERIPHERALS, THE COMPANY FACES A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, MANY OF WHICH HAVE BROADER PRODUCT

LINES, LOWER PRICED PRODUCTS, AND A LARGER INSTALLED CUSTOMER BASE. CONSOLIDATION IN THIS MARKET HAS RESULTED IN LARGER AND POTENTIALLY STRONGER COMPETITORS. PRICE COMPETITION HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE AS COMPETITORS SELLING WINDOWS-BASED

PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED PRODUCT MARGINS. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT INCLUDE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND ARE SMALLER AND SIMPLER THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH

THE COMPANYS EXISTING PRODUCTS. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY ON ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE MAC PLATFORM TO MAINTAIN ITS FUNCTIONAL AND DESIGN ADVANTAGES.

10

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES THAT COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND, THE COMPANY MUST SUCCESSFULLY

MANAGE FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS.

DUE TO THE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRIES

IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUALLY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES, ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR NEW AND UPGRADED PRODUCTS. THE SUCCESS OF NEW

PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO TIMELY AND SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION RAMP ISSUES,

THE AVAILABILITY OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR NEW PRODUCTS, THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND INVENTORY LEVELS IN LINE WITH ANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEMAND, THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN APPROPRIATE QUANTITIES AND COSTS TO MEET

ANTICIPATED DEMAND, AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER DEFECTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE IN ADVANCE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS ON ITS

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY AND OTHER ASSET RISK IN ADDITION TO

PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION RISK.

THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR PRODUCT AND COMPONENT INVENTORIES THAT HAVE

BECOME OBSOLETE OR EXCEED ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AND ACCRUES NECESSARY CANCELLATION FEE RESERVES FOR ORDERS OF EXCESS PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO REVIEWS ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR

CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED, IT RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR

MARKET VALUE. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS PROVISIONS RELATED TO INVENTORY, OTHER ASSETS AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS ARE CURRENTLY ADEQUATE, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL RELATED CHARGES GIVEN THE RAPID AND

UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE IN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES. SUCH CHARGES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND SHIPMENTS. CONSISTENT WITH

INDUSTRY PRACTICE, COMPONENTS ARE NORMALLY ACQUIRED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, OPEN ORDERS AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, INVENTORY COMPONENT PREPAYMENTS, IN EACH CASE BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

TYPICALLY COVER FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS UP TO 150 DAYS. BECAUSE THE COMPANYS MARKETS ARE VOLATILE, COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, THERE IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST

INCORRECTLY AND ORDER OR PRODUCE EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF COMPONENTS OR PRODUCTS, OR NOT FULLY UTILIZE FIRM PURCHASE COMMITMENTS. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND COULD BE IN THE FUTURE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY LEVELS AND RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND UPON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN COMPONENTS IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY CURRENTLY OBTAINS COMPONENTS FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT SUPPLY AND PRICING RISKS. MANY COMPONENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES

ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE SHORTAGES AND SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY PRICING FLUCTUATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO VARIOUS AGREEMENTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS; THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO EXTEND OR RENEW

THESE AGREEMENTS ON SIMILAR TERMS, OR AT ALL. THE FOLLOW-ON EFFECTS FROM THE CREDIT CRISIS ON THE COMPANYS SUPPLIERS, REFERRED TO IN 

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY

 ABOVE, ALSO COULD

AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN COMPONENTS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF SUPPLY SHORTAGES AND PRICE INCREASES THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

11

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO EXPERIENCE DECREASES IN ITS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN FUTURE PERIODS, AS COMPARED TO LEVELS ACHIEVED DURING 2011, LARGELY DUE TO

A HIGHER MIX OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS WITH FLAT OR REDUCED PRICING THAT HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES AND DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO CUSTOMERS, AND POTENTIAL FUTURE COMPONENT COST AND OTHER COST INCREASES.

THE COMPANY AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICE, AND PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRIES COMPETE FOR VARIOUS

COMPONENTS WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY USES SOME CUSTOM COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THESE INDUSTRIES. THE COMPANYS NEW PRODUCTS OFTEN UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS

AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE. WHEN A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT USES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL THE SUPPLIERS YIELDS HAVE MATURED OR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY HAS INCREASED. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE

COMPONENTS AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES, OR AT ALL, MAY BE AFFECTED IF THOSE SUPPLIERS DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS. IF THE SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS FOR A

NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT WERE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED, OR IF A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYED SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON COMPONENT AND PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS, MANY

OF WHOM ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING IS PERFORMED IN WHOLE OR IN

PART BY A FEW OUTSOURCING PARTNERS PRIMARILY LOCATED IN ASIA. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO OUTSOURCED MUCH OF ITS TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT. WHILE THESE ARRANGEMENTS MAY LOWER OPERATING COSTS, THEY ALSO REDUCE THE COMPANYS DIRECT CONTROL

OVER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT EFFECT SUCH DIMINISHED CONTROL WILL HAVE ON THE QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR THE COMPANYS FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH ARRANGEMENTS WITH THESE

PARTNERS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT, THE COMPANY MAY REMAIN RESPONSIBLE TO THE CONSUMER FOR WARRANTY SERVICE IN THE EVENT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS. THE COMPANY ALSO RELIES ON ITS PARTNERS TO ADHERE TO THE COMPANYS

SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT. ANY UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEFECT OR WARRANTY LIABILITY, WHETHER PURSUANT TO ARRANGEMENTS WITH OUTSOURCING PARTNERS OR OTHERWISE, OR MATERIAL VIOLATIONS OF THE SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS REPUTATION, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURE OF MANY CRITICAL COMPONENTS

IS PERFORMED BY SOLE-SOURCED OUTSOURCING PARTNERS IN THE U.S., ASIA AND EUROPE. SINGLE-SOURCED OUTSOURCING PARTNERS IN ASIA PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS. IF MANUFACTURING OR LOGISTICS IN THESE

LOCATIONS IS DISRUPTED FOR ANY REASON INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NATURAL AND MAN-MADE DISASTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES, MILITARY ACTIONS OR ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, LABOR, ENVIRONMENTAL, PUBLIC HEALTH, OR POLITICAL ISSUES, THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON

THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND DIGITAL CONTENT, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WHICH REQUIRES LICENSES FROM THOSE THIRD PARTIES. BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES SUCH

LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON REASONABLE TERMS. THERE IS HOWEVER NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES COULD BE OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN OR RENEW CRITICAL LICENSES ON REASONABLE TERMS,

ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY ALSO CONTRACTS WITH THIRD

PARTIES TO OFFER THEIR DIGITAL CONTENT THROUGH THE ITUNES STORE. THE LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THESE THIRD PARTIES ARE SHORT-TERM AND DO NOT GUARANTEE THE CONTINUATION OR RENEWAL OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS ON REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. SOME

THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS CURRENTLY OR IN THE FUTURE MAY OFFER COMPETING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND COULD TAKE ACTION TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE

12

COMPANY TO LICENSE THEIR CONTENT IN THE FUTURE. OTHER CONTENT OWNERS, PROVIDERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAY SEEK TO LIMIT THE COMPANYS ACCESS TO, OR INCREASE THE COST OF, SUCH CONTENT. IF THE

COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF CONTENT AT REASONABLE PRICES WITH ACCEPTABLE USAGE RULES, OR CONTINUE TO EXPAND ITS GEOGRAPHIC REACH, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

MANY THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT (DRM) AND

OTHER SECURITY SOLUTIONS. IF THESE REQUIREMENTS CHANGE, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO DEVELOP OR LICENSE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE THESE SOLUTIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OR LICENSE SUCH SOLUTIONS AT A REASONABLE COST

AND IN A TIMELY MANNER. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES HAVE PASSED OR MAY PROPOSE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD FORCE THE COMPANY TO LICENSE ITS DRM, WHICH COULD LESSEN THE PROTECTION OF CONTENT AND SUBJECT IT TO PIRACY AND ALSO COULD AFFECT ARRANGEMENTS

WITH THE COMPANYS CONTENT PROVIDERS.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF IT

IS FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED ON INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES, INCLUDING MANY OF THE COMPANYS

COMPETITORS, FREQUENTLY ENTER INTO LITIGATION BASED ON ALLEGATIONS OF PATENT INFRINGEMENT OR OTHER VIOLATIONS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, PATENT HOLDING COMPANIES SEEK TO MONETIZE PATENTS THEY HAVE PURCHASED OR OTHERWISE OBTAINED.

AS THE COMPANY HAS GROWN, THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS CLAIMS AGAINST IT HAVE INCREASED AND MAY CONTINUE TO INCREASE. IN PARTICULAR, THE COMPANYS CELLULAR ENABLED PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICE COMPANIES THAT

HOLD SIGNIFICANT PATENT PORTFOLIOS, AND THE NUMBER OF PATENT CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED. THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING INFRINGEMENT ACTIONS IN COURTS IN A NUMBER OF U.S. JURISDICTIONS AND BEFORE THE U.S.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION, AS WELL AS INTERNATIONALLY IN EUROPE AND ASIA. THE PLAINTIFFS IN THESE ACTIONS FREQUENTLY SEEK INJUNCTIONS AND SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES.

REGARDLESS OF THE SCOPE OR VALIDITY OF SUCH PATENTS OR THE MERITS OF ANY PATENT CLAIMS BY POTENTIAL OR ACTUAL LITIGANTS, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ENGAGE IN PROTRACTED LITIGATION. IF THE COMPANY IS

FOUND TO INFRINGE ONE OR MORE PATENTS, IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES. IF THERE IS A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION PROHIBITING THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING OR SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT AGAINST

THE COMPANY REQUIRING IT TO PAY ROYALTIES TO A THIRD-PARTY, ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT CAN DEVELOP NON-INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY.

IN CERTAIN CASES, THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER THE DESIRABILITY OF ENTERING INTO LICENSING AGREEMENTS, ALTHOUGH NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN

THAT SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR THAT LITIGATION WILL NOT OCCUR. THESE LICENSES MAY ALSO SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE THE COMPANYS OPERATING EXPENSES.

IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION THERE IS NOT AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THE COMPANY MAY HAVE INCURRED A MATERIAL LOSS, OR A MATERIAL LOSS IN EXCESS OF A RECORDED ACCRUAL, WITH RESPECT TO LOSS

CONTINGENCIES, INCLUDING MATTERS RELATED TO INFRINGEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. HOWEVER, THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN. THEREFORE, ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR

MORE OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF A PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE PERFORMANCE DEPENDS IN PART ON SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE

DEVELOPERS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES DECISIONS BY CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS DEPEND IN PART ON THE

AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. IF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES CEASE TO BE DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE NOT TO BUY THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING

RESULTS.

13

WITH RESPECT TO ITS MAC PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY

SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES DEPENDS IN PART ON THE DEVELOPERS PERCEPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING, MAINTAINING, AND UPGRADING SUCH SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS COMPARED TO WINDOWS-BASED PRODUCTS.

THIS ANALYSIS MAY BE BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE PERCEIVED STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTS, THE ANTICIPATED REVENUE THAT MAY BE GENERATED, CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE BY CUSTOMERS OF MAC OS X, AND THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING SUCH APPLICATIONS AND

SERVICES. IF THE COMPANYS MINORITY SHARE OF THE GLOBAL PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET CAUSES DEVELOPERS TO QUESTION THE COMPANYS PROSPECTS, DEVELOPERS COULD BE LESS INCLINED TO DEVELOP OR UPGRADE SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND

MORE INCLINED TO DEVOTE THEIR RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING AND UPGRADING SOFTWARE FOR THE LARGER WINDOWS MARKET.

WITH RESPECT TO

IOS DEVICES, THE COMPANY RELIES ON THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF COMPELLING AND INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, WHICH ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A SINGLE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL, THE APP STORE. THE ABSENCE OF MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE FOR COMPETING PLATFORMS, MAY LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY AND ACCEPTANCE OF THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS BY THE COMPANYS CUSTOMERS, THEREBY CAUSING DEVELOPERS TO REDUCE OR CURTAIL DEVELOPMENT FOR THE IOS PLATFORM. IN

ADDITION, IOS DEVICES ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND, IF THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS ARE UNABLE TO OR CHOOSE NOT TO KEEP UP WITH THIS PACE OF CHANGE, THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS MIGHT NOT SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE AND MAY RESULT IN DISSATISFIED

CUSTOMERS. AS WITH APPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANYS MAC PRODUCTS, THE AVAILABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THESE APPLICATIONS ALSO DEPEND ON DEVELOPERS PERCEPTIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING SOFTWARE FOR THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS RATHER THAN ITS COMPETITORS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING DEVICES THAT USE COMPETING PLATFORMS. IF DEVELOPERS FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON THESE COMPETING PLATFORMS, THE AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANYS

DEVICES MAY SUFFER.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE DEPENDS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTORS, CARRIERS

AND OTHER RESELLERS.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS,

AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, MANY OF WHOM DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS FROM COMPETING MANUFACTURERS. THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO EDUCATION CUSTOMERS, CELLULAR NETWORK

CARRIERS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, RESELLERS AND CONSUMERS THROUGH ITS ONLINE AND RETAIL STORES.

CARRIERS PROVIDING

CELLULAR NETWORK SERVICE FOR IPHONE TYPICALLY SUBSIDIZE USERS PURCHASE OF THE DEVICE. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH SUBSIDIES WILL BE CONTINUED AT ALL OR IN THE SAME AMOUNTS UPON RENEWAL OF THE COMPANYS AGREEMENTS WITH THESE CARRIERS

OR IN AGREEMENTS THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO WITH NEW CARRIERS.

MANY RESELLERS HAVE NARROW OPERATING MARGINS AND HAVE BEEN

NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IN THE PAST BY WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. SOME RESELLERS HAVE PERCEIVED THE EXPANSION OF THE COMPANYS DIRECT SALES AS CONFLICTING WITH THEIR BUSINESS INTERESTS AS DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

SUCH A PERCEPTION COULD DISCOURAGE RESELLERS FROM INVESTING RESOURCES IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS OR LEAD THEM TO LIMIT OR CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN

PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE RESELLER SALES, INCLUDING STAFFING SELECTED RESELLERS STORES WITH COMPANY EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS AND IMPROVING PRODUCT PLACEMENT DISPLAYS. THESE PROGRAMS COULD REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT WHILE PROVIDING NO

ASSURANCE OF RETURN OR INCREMENTAL REVENUE. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THESE RESELLERS WEAKENS, IF RESELLERS STOPPED DISTRIBUTING THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS, OR IF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS CAUSED RESELLERS TO REDUCE THEIR ORDERING AND MARKETING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

14

THE COMPANYS RETAIL BUSINESS HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A

SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT AND COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES AND IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

THE COMPANYS

RETAIL STORES HAVE REQUIRED SUBSTANTIAL FIXED INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INVENTORY AND PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS ENTERED INTO SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS FOR RETAIL SPACE. CERTAIN

STORES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SERVE AS HIGH-PROFILE VENUES TO PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND SERVE AS VEHICLES FOR CORPORATE SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN ELEMENTS, LOCATIONS AND SIZE, THESE STORES REQUIRE

SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVESTMENT THAN THE COMPANYS MORE TYPICAL RETAIL STORES. DUE TO THE HIGH FIXED COST STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETAIL SEGMENT, A DECLINE IN SALES OR THE CLOSURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL OR MULTIPLE STORES COULD

RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LEASE TERMINATION COSTS, WRITE-OFFS OF EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, AND SEVERANCE COSTS THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

MANY FACTORS UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL, POSE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON GENERAL RETAIL ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS

THE COMPANYS INABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STORE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION, INABILITY TO SELL THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AT ADEQUATE MARGINS, FAILURE TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH ITS EXISTING RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS, MORE CHALLENGING

ENVIRONMENT IN MANAGING RETAIL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S., COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF RETAIL INVENTORY, AND INABILITY TO OBTAIN AND RENEW LEASES IN QUALITY RETAIL LOCATIONS AT A REASONABLE COST.

INVESTMENT IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANYS ONGOING BUSINESS AND PRESENT RISKS NOT

ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED.

THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY INVEST, IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES OR

ACQUISITIONS. SUCH ENDEAVORS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING DISTRACTION OF MANAGEMENT FROM CURRENT OPERATIONS, INSUFFICIENT REVENUE TO OFFSET LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRATEGY, INADEQUATE

RETURN OF CAPITAL, AND UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES NOT DISCOVERED IN THE COMPANYS DUE DILIGENCE. THESE NEW VENTURES ARE INHERENTLY RISKY AND MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL. THEY MAY MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES EXPERIENCE QUALITY PROBLEMS FROM TIME TO TIME THAT CAN RESULT

IN DECREASED SALES AND OPERATING MARGIN.

THE COMPANY SELLS COMPLEX HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT CAN

CONTAIN DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING DEFECTS. SOPHISTICATED OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE SOLD BY THE COMPANY, OFTEN CONTAIN BUGS THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE WITH THE SOFTWARES INTENDED OPERATION. THE

COMPANYS ONLINE SERVICES MAY FROM TIME TO TIME EXPERIENCE OUTAGES, SERVICE SLOWDOWNS, OR ERRORS. DEFECTS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THE COMPANY PURCHASES FROM THIRD PARTIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO

DETECT AND FIX ALL DEFECTS IN THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IT SELLS. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE, HARM TO REPUTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT WARRANTY AND OTHER EXPENSES, AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS WORLDWIDE,

CHANGES TO WHICH COULD INCREASE THE COMPANYS COSTS AND INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECTING ITS DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS IN A NUMBER OF AREAS. THESE U.S.

AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS AFFECT THE COMPANYS ACTIVITIES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, AREAS OF LABOR, ADVERTISING, CONTENT, CONSUMER PROTECTION, REAL ESTATE, BILLING, E-COMMERCE, PROMOTIONS, QUALITY OF SERVICES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS,

MOBILE, TELEVISION, INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OWNERSHIP AND INFRINGEMENT, TAX,

15

IMPORT AND EXPORT REQUIREMENTS, ANTI-CORRUPTION, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND CASH REPATRIATION RESTRICTIONS, DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS, ANTI-COMPETITION, ENVIRONMENTAL, HEALTH, AND SAFETY.

BY WAY OF EXAMPLE, LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA DEVICES IN THE MANY JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH

THE COMPANY OPERATES ARE EXTENSIVE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE. SUCH CHANGES COULD INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, RESTRICTIONS ON THE PRODUCTION, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION, AND USE OF THE DEVICE, LOCKING THE DEVICE TO A CARRIERS NETWORK, OR MANDATING THE

USE OF THE DEVICE ON MORE THAN ONE CARRIERS NETWORK. THESE DEVICES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTIFICATION AND REGULATION BY GOVERNMENTAL AND STANDARDIZATION BODIES, AS WELL AS BY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS FOR USE ON THEIR NETWORKS. THESE

CERTIFICATION PROCESSES ARE EXTENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING, AND COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL TESTING REQUIREMENTS, PRODUCT MODIFICATIONS, DELAYS IN PRODUCT SHIPMENT DATES, OR PRECLUDE THE COMPANY FROM SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS.

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS, REGULATIONS AND SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS MAY BE ONEROUS AND EXPENSIVE, AND THEY MAY BE INCONSISTENT FROM

JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION, FURTHER INCREASING THE COST OF COMPLIANCE. THIS INCREASES THE COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS, AND ANY SUCH COSTS, WHICH MAY RISE IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR IN THEIR

INTERPRETATION COULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE MAKE THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES LESS ATTRACTIVE TO THE COMPANYS CUSTOMERS, DELAY THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS IN ONE OR MORE REGIONS, CAUSE THE COMPANY TO CHANGE OR LIMIT

ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

COMPANYS EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS WILL NOT VIOLATE SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THE COMPANYS POLICIES. ANY SUCH VIOLATIONS COULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION

OR OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE AND AVAILABILITY OF KEY

PERSONNEL.

MUCH OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY AND SERVICE OF KEY PERSONNEL,

INCLUDING ITS CEO, ITS EXECUTIVE TEAM AND HIGHLY SKILLED EMPLOYEES. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY, WHERE MOST OF THE COMPANYS

KEY PERSONNEL ARE LOCATED.

POLITICAL EVENTS, WAR, TERRORISM, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER

CIRCUMSTANCES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY.

WAR, TERRORISM, GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, PUBLIC HEALTH

ISSUES, AND OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS HAVE CAUSED AND COULD CAUSE DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION TO INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AND THUS COULD HAVE A STRONG NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY, ITS SUPPLIERS, LOGISTICS PROVIDERS,

MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERRUPTION BY NATURAL DISASTERS, FIRE, POWER SHORTAGES, NUCLEAR POWER PLANT ACCIDENTS, TERRORIST ATTACKS, AND OTHER HOSTILE

ACTS, LABOR DISPUTES, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER EVENTS BEYOND ITS CONTROL. SUCH EVENTS COULD DECREASE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO MAKE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS,

INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS, OR TO RECEIVE COMPONENTS FROM ITS SUPPLIERS, AND CREATE DELAYS AND INEFFICIENCIES IN THE COMPANYS SUPPLY CHAIN. SHOULD MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING PANDEMICS, ARISE, THE COMPANY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED

BY MORE STRINGENT EMPLOYEE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS IN FREIGHT SERVICES, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS BETWEEN REGIONS, DELAYS IN PRODUCTION RAMPS OF NEW PRODUCTS, AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE

COMPANYS MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, ITS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

CERTAIN COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS, ARE IN LOCATIONS THAT COULD BE AFFECTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS. IN THE EVENT OF A NATURAL DISASTER, LOSSES, SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY TIME AND SUBSTANTIAL EXPENDITURES COULD BE REQUIRED TO RESUME

OPERATIONS AND THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

16

PLEASE ALSO REFER TO THE DISCUSSION OF RISKS RELATED TO THE MARCH 11, 2011, JAPAN

EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI AND THE RECENT FLOODING IN THAILAND IN PART II, ITEM 7, MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, UNDER THE SUBHEADING JAPAN EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI

AND THAILAND FLOODING, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES OR NETWORK DISRUPTIONS THAT COULD DAMAGE THE COMPANYS REPUTATION, BUSINESS OPERATIONS, AND FINANCIAL CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES AND NETWORK DISRUPTIONS. THESE MAY BE CAUSED BY NATURAL DISASTERS, ACCIDENTS, POWER DISRUPTIONS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, ACTS OF

TERRORISM OR WAR, COMPUTER VIRUSES, PHYSICAL OR ELECTRONIC BREAK-INS, OR SIMILAR EVENTS OR DISRUPTIONS. SYSTEM REDUNDANCY MAY BE INEFFECTIVE OR INADEQUATE, AND THE COMPANYS DISASTER RECOVERY PLANNING MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR ALL

EVENTUALITIES. SUCH FAILURES OR DISRUPTIONS COULD PREVENT ACCESS TO THE COMPANYS ONLINE STORES AND SERVICES, PRECLUDE RETAIL STORE TRANSACTIONS, COMPROMISE COMPANY OR CUSTOMER DATA, AND RESULT IN DELAYED OR CANCELLED ORDERS. SYSTEM FAILURES

AND DISRUPTIONS COULD ALSO IMPEDE THE MANUFACTURING AND SHIPPING OF PRODUCTS, DELIVERY OF ONLINE SERVICES, TRANSACTIONS PROCESSING AND FINANCIAL REPORTING.

THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO BREACHES OF ITS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, WHICH COULD DAMAGE THE COMPANYS REPUTATION, BUSINESS PARTNER AND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS, AND ACCESS TO ONLINE STORES

AND SERVICES. SUCH BREACHES COULD SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL, FINANCIAL, LEGAL, AND OPERATIONAL CONSEQUENCES.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS REQUIRES IT TO USE AND STORE CUSTOMER, EMPLOYEE, AND BUSINESS PARTNER PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION (PII). THIS MAY INCLUDE NAMES, ADDRESSES, PHONE NUMBERS,

EMAIL ADDRESSES, CONTACT PREFERENCES, TAX IDENTIFICATION NUMBERS, AND PAYMENT ACCOUNT INFORMATION. ALTHOUGH MALICIOUS ATTACKS TO GAIN ACCESS TO PII AFFECT MANY COMPANIES ACROSS VARIOUS INDUSTRIES, THE COMPANY MAY BE AT A RELATIVELY GREATER RISK OF

BEING TARGETED BECAUSE OF ITS HIGH PROFILE AND THE AMOUNT OF PII MANAGED.

THE COMPANY REQUIRES USER NAMES AND PASSWORDS IN

ORDER TO ACCESS ITS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES ENCRYPTION AND AUTHENTICATION TECHNOLOGIES TO SECURE THE TRANSMISSION AND STORAGE OF DATA. THESE SECURITY MEASURES MAY BE COMPROMISED AS A RESULT OF THIRD-PARTY SECURITY

BREACHES, EMPLOYEE ERROR, MALFEASANCE, FAULTY PASSWORD MANAGEMENT, OR OTHER IRREGULARITY, AND RESULT IN PERSONS OBTAINING UNAUTHORIZED ACCESS TO COMPANY DATA OR ACCOUNTS. THIRD PARTIES MAY ATTEMPT TO FRAUDULENTLY INDUCE EMPLOYEES OR CUSTOMERS INTO

DISCLOSING USER NAMES, PASSWORDS OR OTHER SENSITIVE INFORMATION, WHICH MAY IN TURN BE USED TO ACCESS THE COMPANYS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. TO HELP PROTECT CUSTOMERS AND THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY MONITORS ACCOUNTS AND SYSTEMS FOR UNUSUAL

ACTIVITY AND MAY FREEZE ACCOUNTS UNDER SUSPICIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN THE DELAY OR LOSS OF CUSTOMER ORDERS.

THE COMPANY DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO NETWORK SECURITY, DATA ENCRYPTION, AND OTHER SECURITY MEASURES TO PROTECT ITS SYSTEMS AND

DATA, BUT THESE SECURITY MEASURES CANNOT PROVIDE ABSOLUTE SECURITY. THE COMPANY MAY EXPERIENCE A BREACH OF ITS SYSTEMS AND MAY BE UNABLE TO PROTECT SENSITIVE DATA. MOREOVER, IF A COMPUTER SECURITY BREACH AFFECTS THE COMPANYS SYSTEMS OR RESULTS

IN THE UNAUTHORIZED RELEASE OF PII, THE COMPANYS REPUTATION AND BRAND COULD BE MATERIALLY DAMAGED AND USE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD DECREASE. THE COMPANY WOULD ALSO BE EXPOSED TO A RISK OF LOSS OR LITIGATION AND

POSSIBLE LIABILITY, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS, RULES, POLICIES AND OTHER OBLIGATIONS REGARDING DATA PROTECTION.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE AND INTERNATIONAL LAWS RELATING TO THE COLLECTION, USE, RETENTION, SECURITY AND TRANSFER OF PII.

IN MANY CASES, THESE LAWS APPLY NOT ONLY TO THIRD-PARTY TRANSACTIONS, BUT ALSO TO TRANSFERS OF INFORMATION BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES, AND AMONG THE COMPANY, ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND OTHER PARTIES WITH WHICH THE COMPANY HAS COMMERCIAL

RELATIONS. SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS HAVE PASSED NEW LAWS IN THIS

17

AREA, AND OTHER JURISDICTIONS ARE CONSIDERING IMPOSING ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS. THESE LAWS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MAY BE INCONSISTENT FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. COMPLYING WITH EMERGING

AND CHANGING INTERNATIONAL REQUIREMENTS MAY CAUSE THE COMPANY TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS OR REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO CHANGE ITS BUSINESS PRACTICES. NONCOMPLIANCE COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES OR SIGNIFICANT LEGAL LIABILITY.

THE COMPANYS PRIVACY POLICIES AND PRACTICES CONCERNING THE USE AND DISCLOSURE OF DATA ARE POSTED ON ITS WEBSITE. ANY FAILURE BY THE

COMPANY, ITS SUPPLIERS OR OTHER PARTIES WITH WHOM THE COMPANY DOES BUSINESS TO COMPLY WITH ITS POSTED PRIVACY POLICIES OR WITH OTHER FEDERAL, STATE OR INTERNATIONAL PRIVACY-RELATED OR DATA PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS COULD RESULT IN PROCEEDINGS

AGAINST THE COMPANY BY GOVERNMENTAL ENTITIES OR OTHERS, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO PAYMENT CARD ASSOCIATION RULES AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER ITS CONTRACTS WITH PAYMENT CARD PROCESSORS. UNDER

THESE RULES AND OBLIGATIONS, IF INFORMATION IS COMPROMISED, THE COMPANY COULD BE LIABLE TO PAYMENT CARD ISSUERS FOR THE COST OF ASSOCIATED EXPENSES AND PENALTIES. IN ADDITION, IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO FOLLOW PAYMENT CARD INDUSTRY SECURITY STANDARDS,

EVEN IF NO CUSTOMER INFORMATION IS COMPROMISED, THE COMPANY COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT FINES OR EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN PAYMENT CARD TRANSACTION COSTS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS QUARTERLY REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE.

THE COMPANYS PROFIT MARGINS VARY AMONG ITS PRODUCTS AND ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE COMPANYS SOFTWARE, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER GROSS MARGINS

THAN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS OTHER PRODUCTS. GROSS MARGINS ON THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS VARY ACROSS PRODUCT LINES AND CAN CHANGE OVER TIME AS A RESULT OF PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, PRICING AND CONFIGURATION CHANGES, AND COMPONENT,

WARRANTY, AND OTHER COST FLUCTUATIONS. THE COMPANYS DIRECT SALES GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER ASSOCIATED GROSS MARGINS THAN ITS INDIRECT SALES THROUGH ITS CHANNEL PARTNERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN

PERCENTAGES, AS WELL AS OVERALL PROFITABILITY, MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIC OR CHANNEL MIX, NEW PRODUCTS, COMPONENT COST INCREASES, STRENGTHENING U.S. DOLLAR, OR PRICE COMPETITION. THE COMPANY

HAS TYPICALLY EXPERIENCED GREATER NET SALES IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER COMPARED TO OTHER FISCAL QUARTERS DUE TO INCREASED HOLIDAY SEASONAL DEMAND. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY SELLS MORE PRODUCTS FROM TIME-TO-TIME DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF A QUARTER

THAN IT DOES DURING EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO MONTHS. DEVELOPMENTS LATE IN A QUARTER, SUCH AS LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, ISSUES WITH NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AN INTERNAL SYSTEMS FAILURE, OR FAILURE OF ONE OF THE

COMPANYS LOGISTICS, COMPONENTS SUPPLY, OR MANUFACTURING PARTNERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE IS SUBJECT TO VOLATILITY.

THE

COMPANYS STOCK CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE STOCK MARKET AS A WHOLE HAS EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE STOCK PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN WAYS THAT

MAY HAVE BEEN UNRELATED TO THESE COMPANIES OPERATING PERFORMANCE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS STOCK PRICE REFLECTS HIGH FUTURE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY EXPECTATIONS. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MEET THESE EXPECTATIONS ITS STOCK PRICE MAY

SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND EMPLOYEE RETENTION.

THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

ITS REVENUE AND EARNINGS FROM ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE U.S. AND FOREIGN LAWS AND REGULATIONS, SUCH AS IMPORT AND EXPORT REQUIREMENTS, ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS, TAX LAWS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND CASH REPATRIATION

RESTRICTIONS, DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS, ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, LABOR LAWS, AND ANTI-COMPETITION REGULATIONS, INCREASES THE COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO COMPLY WITH

THESE LAWS AND

18

REGULATIONS, A VIOLATION BY THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES, CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS COULD NEVERTHELESS OCCUR. THE CONSEQUENCES OF SUCH VIOLATIONS COULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE MATERIALLY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

OPERATING RESULTS ALSO COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ECONOMIC AND LABOR CONDITIONS, INCREASED DUTIES, TAXES AND OTHER COSTS, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, AND CHANGES

IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS LOCAL CURRENCIES. MARGINS ON SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING DUTIES, TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO EXPOSED TO CREDIT AND COLLECTABILITY RISK ON ITS TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CUSTOMERS IN

CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE IT CAN EFFECTIVELY LIMIT ITS CREDIT RISK AND AVOID LOSSES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATE TO NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SALES AND

OPERATING EXPENSES WORLDWIDE. WEAKENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS, AND GENERALLY WILL LEAD THE COMPANY TO RAISE

INTERNATIONAL PRICING, POTENTIALLY REDUCING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, DUE TO COMPETITION OR OTHER REASONS, THE COMPANY MAY DECIDE NOT TO RAISE LOCAL PRICES TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE DOLLARS STRENGTHENING,

OR AT ALL, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS. CONVERSELY, A STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHILE GENERALLY BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANYS FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS, COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY TO REDUCE INTERNATIONAL PRICING AND INCUR LOSSES ON ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, THEREBY LIMITING THE BENEFIT. ADDITIONALLY, STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY

ALSO INCREASE THE COMPANYS COST OF PRODUCT COMPONENTS DENOMINATED IN THOSE CURRENCIES, THUS ADVERSELY AFFECTING GROSS MARGINS.

THE COMPANY HAS USED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS, TO HEDGE CERTAIN EXPOSURES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF SUCH HEDGING

ACTIVITIES MAY NOT OFFSET ANY OR MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OVER THE LIMITED TIME THE HEDGES ARE IN PLACE.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECOGNIZED ANY SIGNIFICANT LOSSES TO DATE ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ANY

SIGNIFICANT DECLINES IN THEIR MARKET VALUES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. GIVEN THE GLOBAL NATURE OF ITS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY HAS BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS. CREDIT

RATINGS AND PRICING OF THESE INVESTMENTS CAN BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY LIQUIDITY, CREDIT DETERIORATION, FINANCIAL RESULTS, ECONOMIC RISK, POLITICAL RISK, SOVEREIGN RISK OR OTHER FACTORS. AS A RESULT, THE VALUE AND LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANYS

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES COULD DECLINE AND RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT IMPAIRMENT, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES AND PREPAYMENTS RELATED TO

LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS. THIS RISK IS HEIGHTENED DURING PERIODS WHEN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORSEN.

THE COMPANY

DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL OR CREDIT INSURANCE.

THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT AND COLLECTABILITY RISK ON ITS TRADE RECEIVABLES IS HIGHER IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND ITS ABILITY TO MITIGATE SUCH RISKS MAY BE LIMITED. CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS ACCOUNTED FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2011. THE

19

COMPANY ALSO HAS UNSECURED VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES RESULTING FROM PURCHASES OF COMPONENTS BY OUTSOURCING PARTNERS AND OTHER VENDORS THAT MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS

FOR THE COMPANY. TWO VENDORS ACCOUNTED FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANYS NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES AS OF SEPTEMBER 24, 2011. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS MADE PREPAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO SECURE SUPPLY OF

INVENTORY COMPONENTS. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES TO MONITOR AND LIMIT EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE AND VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES AS WELL AS LONG-TERM PREPAYMENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE SUCH PROCEDURES WILL EFFECTIVELY LIMIT ITS

CREDIT RISK AND AVOID LOSSES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

UNFAVORABLE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN FULLY RESOLVED AND THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY CONDUCT OF BUSINESS, AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS MAY ARISE IN THE

FUTURE. RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY AND, REGARDLESS OF THE MERIT OF THE CLAIMS, LITIGATION MAY BE EXPENSIVE, TIME-CONSUMING, DISRUPTIVE TO THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, AND DISTRACTING TO MANAGEMENT. IN

RECOGNITION OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS TO SETTLE LITIGATION.

ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT

CONSIDERS THE LIKELIHOOD OF SUCH AN OUTCOME TO BE REMOTE, IF ONE OR MORE OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WERE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD FOR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF MANAGEMENTS EXPECTATIONS, THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF A PARTICULAR REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED. FURTHER, SUCH AN OUTCOME COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT COMPENSATORY, PUNITIVE OR TREBLED MONETARY DAMAGES, DISGORGEMENT OF REVENUE OR PROFITS, REMEDIAL

CORPORATE MEASURES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST THE COMPANY THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS TAX RATES, THE ADOPTION OF NEW U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL TAX LEGISLATION OR EXPOSURE TO ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES COULD AFFECT ITS FUTURE RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO TAXES IN THE U.S. AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANYS FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE

AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION. ANY OF THESE CHANGES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS PROFITABILITY. THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUAL EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF

ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND OPERATING RESULTS.
