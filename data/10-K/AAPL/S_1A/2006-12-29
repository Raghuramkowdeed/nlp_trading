ITEM 1A. RISK

FACTORS

BECAUSE OF THE FOLLOWING

FACTORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION, PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE

A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT USE

HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE MATTERS RELATING TO THE INVESTIGATION BY THE

SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE RESTATEMENT OF THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION AND GOVERNMENTAL

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS.

ON JUNE 29, 2006, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THAT AN

INTERNAL REVIEW HAD DISCOVERED IRREGULARITIES RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF

CERTAIN STOCK OPTION GRANTS MADE BETWEEN 1997 AND 2001, INCLUDING A GRANT TO

ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER (CEO), STEVE JOBS. THE COMPANY ALSO ANNOUNCED A

SPECIAL COMMITTEE OF OUTSIDE DIRECTORS (SPECIAL COMMITTEE) HAD BEEN FORMED

AND HAD HIRED INDEPENDENT COUNSEL TO CONDUCT A FULL INVESTIGATION OF THE

COMPANYS PAST STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES. AS DESCRIBED IN THE

EXPLANATORY NOTE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING PART I, ITEM 1, AND IN NOTE 2 RESTATEMENT

OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN THIS FORM 10-K, AS A RESULT OF THE INTERNAL REVIEW AND

INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION, MANAGEMENT HAS CONCLUDED, AND THE AUDIT AND FINANCE

COMMITTEE AGREES, THAT INCORRECT MEASUREMENT DATES WERE USED FOR FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING PURPOSES FOR STOCK OPTION GRANTS MADE IN

20

CERTAIN PRIOR PERIODS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS

RECORDED ADDITIONAL NON-CASH STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND RELATED TAX

EFFECTS, WITH REGARD TO CERTAIN PAST STOCK OPTION GRANTS, AND THE COMPANY HAS RESTATED

CERTAIN PREVIOUSLY FILED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS FORM 10-K.

THE INTERNAL REVIEW, THE INDEPENDENT INVESTIGATION,

AND RELATED ACTIVITIES HAVE REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSES

FOR LEGAL, ACCOUNTING, TAX AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL SERVICES, HAVE DIVERTED

MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM THE COMPANYS BUSINESS, AND COULD IN THE FUTURE HARM

ITS BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS MADE APPROPRIATE

JUDGMENTS IN DETERMINING THE CORRECT MEASUREMENT DATES FOR ITS STOCK OPTION

GRANTS, THE SEC MAY DISAGREE WITH THE MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ACCOUNTED

FOR AND REPORTED, OR NOT REPORTED, THE FINANCIAL IMPACT. ACCORDINGLY, THERE IS

A RISK THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO FURTHER RESTATE ITS PRIOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

AMEND PRIOR FILINGS WITH THE SEC, OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS NOT CURRENTLY

CONTEMPLATED.

THE COMPANYS PAST STOCK OPTION GRANTING PRACTICES AND

THE RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE EXPOSED THE COMPANY TO

GREATER RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND GOVERNMENT

ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS. AS DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,

SEVERAL DERIVATIVE COMPLAINTS AND A CLASS ACTION COMPLAINT HAVE BEEN FILED IN

STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS AGAINST THE COMPANYS DIRECTORS AND CERTAIN OF ITS

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS PERTAINING TO ALLEGATIONS RELATING TO STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED THE RESULTS OF ITS INTERNAL REVIEW AND INDEPENDENT

INVESTIGATION TO THE SEC AND THE UNITED STATES ATTORNEYS OFFICE FOR THE

NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, AND IN THAT REGARD THE COMPANY HAS RESPONDED

TO INFORMAL REQUESTS FOR DOCUMENTS AND ADDITIONAL INFORMATION. THE COMPANY

INTENDS TO CONTINUE FULL COOPERATION. NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN REGARDING THE

OUTCOMES FROM LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS OR GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT

ACTIONS RELATING TO THE COMPANYS PAST STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. THE RESOLUTION

OF THESE MATTERS WILL BE TIME CONSUMING, EXPENSIVE, AND WILL DISTRACT

MANAGEMENT FROM THE CONDUCT OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS. FURTHERMORE, IF THE

COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO ADVERSE FINDINGS IN LITIGATION, REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS OR

GOVERNMENT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS, THE COMPANY COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY DAMAGES OR

PENALTIES OR HAVE OTHER REMEDIES IMPOSED, WHICH COULD HARM ITS BUSINESS,

FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

IN AUGUST 2006, THE

COMPANY RECEIVED A NASDAQ STAFF DETERMINATION LETTER STATING THAT, AS A RESULT

OF THE DELAYED FILING OF THE COMPANYS FORM 10-Q FOR THE QUARTER

ENDED JULY 1, 2006 (THE THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q), THE COMPANY

WAS NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FILING REQUIREMENTS FOR CONTINUED LISTING AS SET

FORTH IN MARKETPLACE RULE 4310(C)(14) AND WAS THEREFORE SUBJECT TO

DELISTING FROM THE NASDAQ STOCK MARKET. ON OCTOBER 24, 2006, THE

NASDAQ LISTING QUALIFICATIONS PANEL GRANTED THE COMPANYS REQUEST FOR CONTINUED

LISTING, SUBJECT TO THE COMPANY FILING THE THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q,

AND ANY REQUIRED RESTATEMENTS, WITH THE SEC BY DECEMBER 29, 2006. ON DECEMBER 29,

2006, THE COMPANY FILED THE THIRD QUARTER FORM 10-Q WITH THE SEC. WITH

THE FILING OF THIS FORM 10-K, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS

REMEDIED ITS NON-COMPLIANCE WITH MARKETPLACE RULE 4310(C)(14), SUBJECT TO

NASDAQS AFFIRMATIVE COMPLETION OF ITS COMPLIANCE PROTOCOLS AND ITS

NOTIFICATION OF THE COMPANY ACCORDINGLY. HOWEVER, IF THE SEC DISAGREES WITH THE

MANNER IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ACCOUNTED FOR AND REPORTED, OR NOT REPORTED,

THE FINANCIAL IMPACT OF PAST STOCK OPTION GRANTS, THERE COULD BE FURTHER DELAYS

IN FILING SUBSEQUENT SEC REPORTS THAT MIGHT RESULT IN DELISTING OF THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK FROM THE NASDAQ GLOBAL SELECT MARKET.

UNFAVORABLE RESULTS

OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN PART I, ITEM 3

OF THIS FORM 10-K. THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN OTHER

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS AND WHICH HAVE NOT BEEN FULLY ADJUDICATED. RESULTS OF LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. IN ADDITION, LITIGATION MAY BE

DISRUPTIVE TO THE COMPANYS NORMAL

21

BUSINESS OPERATIONS. SHOULD

THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN CERTAIN LEGAL MATTERS, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS AND POLITICAL EVENTS COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND THE FINANCIAL HEALTH

OF ITS SUPPLIERS, DISTRIBUTORS, AND RESELLERS.

THE COMPANYS OPERATING

PERFORMANCE DEPENDS SIGNIFICANTLY ON ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE U.S. AND

ABROAD. AT TIMES IN THE PAST, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS HAS BEEN

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY DIFFICULT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT

FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAKES IT DIFFICULT TO FORECAST FUTURE DEMAND FOR THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND RELATED OPERATING RESULTS. SHOULD GLOBAL AND/OR REGIONAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED, AS COULD THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF ITS SUPPLIERS,

DISTRIBUTORS, AND RESELLERS.

WAR, TERRORISM, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER

CIRCUMSTANCES COULD DISRUPT SUPPLY, DELIVERY, OR DEMAND OF PRODUCTS, WHICH

COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE.

WAR, TERRORISM, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER

BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS, WHETHER IN THE U.S. OR ABROAD, HAVE CAUSED AND COULD

CAUSE DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION TO INTERNATIONAL

COMMERCE

AND GLOBAL ECONOMY, AND THUS MAY HAVE A STRONG NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE GLOBAL

ECONOMY,

THE COMPANY, AND THE COMPANYS SUPPLIERS OR CUSTOMERS. THE

COMPANYS MAJOR BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERRUPTION BY EARTHQUAKE,

OTHER NATURAL DISASTERS, FIRE, POWER SHORTAGES, TERRORIST ATTACKS AND OTHER

HOSTILE ACTS, LABOR DISPUTES, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER EVENTS BEYOND ITS

CONTROL. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, ITS

CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND OTHER CRITICAL

BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING

VENDORS, ARE LOCATED NEAR MAJOR SEISMIC FAULTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY DOES NOT

CARRY EARTHQUAKE INSURANCE FOR DIRECT QUAKE-RELATED LOSSES, THE COMPANYS

OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE OR OTHER NATURAL OR MAN-MADE

DISASTER.

ALTHOUGH IT IS IMPOSSIBLE

TO PREDICT THE OCCURRENCES OR CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH EVENTS, SUCH EVENTS

COULD RESULT IN A DECREASE IN DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, MAKE IT

DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS OR

TO RECEIVE COMPONENTS FROM ITS SUPPLIERS, AND CREATE DELAYS AND INEFFICIENCIES

IN THE COMPANYS SUPPLY CHAIN. IN ADDITION, SHOULD MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES

INCLUDING PANDEMICS ARISE, THE COMPANY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY MORE

STRINGENT EMPLOYEE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS IN THE

AVAILABILITY OF FREIGHT SERVICES, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF

PRODUCTS BETWEEN VARIOUS REGIONS, DELAYS IN PRODUCTION RAMPS OF NEW PRODUCTS,

AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND

COMPONENT SUPPLIERS. THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY SUCH EVENTS.

THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND RELATED

PERIPHERALS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS DIGITAL MUSIC DEVICES AND RELATED

SERVICES, IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO EFFECTIVELY

COMPETE IN THESE MARKETS, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

AND IS CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE PRICING PRACTICES, DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON

GROSS MARGINS, FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, SHORT PRODUCT LIFE

CYCLES, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT

PRICE/PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS, RAPID ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT

ADVANCEMENTS BY COMPETITORS, PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS, AND A

LARGE NUMBER OF COMPETITORS. PRICE COMPETITION IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS

AND RELATED PERIPHERALS HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE AS COMPETITORS WHO SELL

WINDOWS AND LINUX BASED PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND

LOWERED THEIR PRODUCT MARGINS FOR PERSONAL COMPUTING PRODUCTS. THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY

CONTINUE TO BE, ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THESE AND OTHER INDUSTRY-WIDE PRICING

PRESSURES AND DOWNWARD PRESSURES ON GROSS MARGINS.

22

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY HAS ALSO BEEN

CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES IN SOFTWARE FUNCTIONALITY,

HARDWARE PERFORMANCE, AND FEATURES BASED ON EXISTING OR EMERGING INDUSTRY

STANDARDS. FURTHER, AS THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY AND ITS CUSTOMERS PLACE

MORE RELIANCE ON THE INTERNET, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT

ARE SMALLER AND SIMPLER THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS MAY COMPETE FOR

MARKET SHARE WITH THE COMPANYS EXISTING PRODUCTS. SEVERAL COMPETITORS OF THE

COMPANY HAVE TARGETED CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS KEY MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING

CONSUMER, EDUCATION, PROFESSIONAL AND CONSUMER DIGITAL VIDEO EDITING, AND

DESIGN AND PUBLISHING. SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS HAVE INTRODUCED

DIGITAL MUSIC PRODUCTS AND/OR ONLINE STORES OFFERING DIGITAL MUSIC DISTRIBUTION

THAT MIMIC MANY OF THE UNIQUE DESIGN, TECHNICAL FEATURES, AND SOLUTIONS OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, MANY

OF WHOM HAVE BROADER PRODUCT LINES AND LARGER INSTALLED CUSTOMER BASES THAN

THOSE OF THE COMPANY. ADDITIONALLY, THERE HAS BEEN A TREND TOWARDS

CONSOLIDATION IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER INDUSTRY THAT HAS RESULTED IN LARGER AND

POTENTIALLY STRONGER COMPETITORS IN THE COMPANYS MARKETS.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY MAKER OF HARDWARE

USING THE MAC OS. THE MAC OS HAS A MINORITY MARKET SHARE IN THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER MARKET, WHICH IS DOMINATED BY MAKERS OF COMPUTERS UTILIZING COMPETING

OPERATING SYSTEMS, INCLUDING WINDOWS AND LINUX. THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ARE SUBSTANTIALLY DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO

CONTINUE TO DEVELOP IMPROVEMENTS TO THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM TO MAINTAIN

PERCEIVED DESIGN AND FUNCTIONAL ADVANTAGES OVER COMPETING PLATFORMS. ADDITIONALLY,

IF UNAUTHORIZED COPIES OF THE MAC OS ARE USED ON OTHER COMPANIES HARDWARE

PRODUCTS AND RESULT IN DECREASED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS,

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY FOCUSED ON MARKET

OPPORTUNITIES RELATED TO DIGITAL MUSIC DISTRIBUTION AND RELATED CONSUMER

ELECTRONIC DEVICES, INCLUDING IPODS. THE COMPANY FACES SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION

FROM OTHER COMPANIES PROMOTING THEIR OWN DIGITAL MUSIC PRODUCTS INCLUDING MP3

PLAYERS, MUSIC ENABLED CELL PHONES, FREE PEER-TO-PEER MUSIC AND VIDEO SERVICES,

AND FREE STREAMING OF DIGITAL CONTENT VIA THE INTERNET. THESE COMPETITORS

INCLUDE BOTH NEW ENTRANTS WITH DIFFERENT MARKET APPROACHES, SUCH AS

SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES MODELS, AND ALSO LARGER COMPANIES THAT MAY HAVE

SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, AND OTHER RESOURCES, AS WELL AS

ESTABLISHED HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, AND DIGITAL CONTENT SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS.

FAILURE TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE COULD NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY EXPECTS COMPETITION IN THIS SPACE

TO INTENSIFY AS COMPETITORS ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THE COMPANYS APPROACH TO

TIGHTLY INTEGRATING THESE COMPONENTS WITHIN THEIR INDIVIDUAL OFFERINGS OR WORK

MORE COLLABORATIVELY WITH EACH OTHER TO OFFER SOLUTIONS THAT ARE MORE

INTEGRATED THAN THOSE THEY OFFER CURRENTLY. SOME OF THESE CURRENT AND POTENTIAL

COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO PROFIT OR EVEN AT A LOSS TO COMPETE WITH THE

COMPANYS OFFERINGS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO

CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT EFFECTIVELY COMPETE IN THESE

MARKETS. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO HAVE TO RESPOND TO PRICE COMPETITION BY LOWERING

PRICES AND/OR INCREASING FEATURES WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

MUSIC PRODUCT GROSS MARGINS AS WELL AS OVERALL COMPANY GROSS MARGINS.

THE COMPANY ALSO FACES

SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION IN THE U.S. EDUCATION MARKET. U.S. ELEMENTARY AND

SECONDARY SCHOOLS, AS WELL AS COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITY CUSTOMERS, REMAIN A CORE

MARKET FOR THE COMPANY. IN AN EFFORT TO GAIN MARKET SHARE AND REMAIN

COMPETITIVE, THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE ONE-TO-ONE (1:1) LEARNING

SOLUTIONS IN EDUCATION.

1:1 LEARNING

SOLUTIONS

TYPICALLY CONSIST OF A

PORTABLE COMPUTER FOR EVERY STUDENT AND TEACHER ALONG WITH THE INSTALLATION OF

A WIRELESS NETWORK.

THESE 1:1

LEARNING SOLUTIONS AND OTHER STRATEGIC SALES ARE GENERALLY PRICED MORE

AGGRESSIVELY AND COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY LESS PROFITABILITY OR FINANCIAL

LOSSES, PARTICULARLY FOR LARGER DEALS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS

TAKEN CERTAIN STEPS TO STRENGTHEN ITS POSITION IN THE EDUCATION MARKET, THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO INCREASE OR MAINTAIN ITS

SHARE OF THE EDUCATION MARKET OR EXECUTE PROFITABLY ON LARGE STRATEGIC

23

ARRANGEMENTS. FAILURE TO

DO SO MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN A SUFFICIENT SUPPLY OF COMPONENTS, INCLUDING

MICROPROCESSORS, SOME OF WHICH ARE IN SHORT SUPPLY OR AVAILABLE ONLY FROM

LIMITED SOURCES.

ALTHOUGH MOST COMPONENTS

ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS ARE GENERALLY AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE

SOURCES, CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING MICROPROCESSORS AND ASICS ARE

CURRENTLY OBTAINED BY THE COMPANY FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES. SOME KEY

COMPONENTS (INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION DRAM, NAND FLASH-MEMORY, AND TFT-LCD

FLAT-PANEL DISPLAYS), WHILE CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY FROM MULTIPLE

SOURCES, ARE AT TIMES SUBJECT TO INDUSTRY-WIDE AVAILABILITY AND PRICING PRESSURES.

IN ADDITION, NEW PRODUCTS INTRODUCED BY THE COMPANY OFTEN INITIALLY UTILIZE

CUSTOM COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE UNTIL THE COMPANY HAS EVALUATED

WHETHER THERE IS A NEED FOR, AND SUBSEQUENTLY QUALIFIES, ADDITIONAL SUPPLIERS.

IN SITUATIONS WHERE A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT UTILIZES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL

CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE SUPPLIERS YIELDS HAVE

MATURED. THE COMPANY AND OTHER PRODUCERS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER AND CONSUMER

ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES ALSO COMPETE FOR VARIOUS COMPONENTS WITH OTHER

INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE

COMPANY USES SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER OR CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE

COMPONENTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF PRODUCERS DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON THE

PRODUCTION OF COMPONENTS OTHER THAN THOSE CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANYS

REQUIREMENTS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY COMPONENT WERE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED ON A

NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT, THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY MUST SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE FREQUENT PRODUCT

INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE

CUSTOMER DEMAND.

DUE TO THE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COMPETITIVE NATURE OF

THE PERSONAL COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES, WHICH ARE

CHARACTERIZED BY DYNAMIC CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS AND RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL

ADVANCES, THE COMPANY MUST CONTINUALLY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES,

ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE, AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE

CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND UPGRADED VERSIONS OF THE COMPANYS

EXISTING PRODUCTS. THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS IS DEPENDENT ON A

NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING MARKET ACCEPTANCE; THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE

THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, INCLUDING THE TRANSITION TO

INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, AND PRODUCTION RAMP ISSUES; THE AVAILABILITY

OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR NEW PRODUCTS; THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF PURCHASE

COMMITMENTS AND INVENTORY LEVELS IN LINE WITH ANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEMAND; THE

AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN APPROPRIATE QUANTITIES AND COSTS TO MEET

ANTICIPATED DEMAND; AND THE RISK THAT NEW PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER

DEFECTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY CANNOT

DETERMINE IN ADVANCE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT NEW PRODUCTS WILL HAVE ON ITS SALES OR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JUNE 2005, THE

COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS PLAN TO BEGIN USING INTEL MICROPROCESSORS IN ITS

COMPUTERS. DURING 2006, THE COMPANY INTRODUCED NEW INTEL-BASED MODELS OF THE

MACBOOK PRO, MACBOOK, MAC PRO, IMAC, AND MAC MINI COMPUTERS. THE COMPANYS

TRANSITION TO INTEL MICROPROCESSORS FOR MACINTOSH SYSTEMS WAS COMPLETED IN AUGUST 2006,

AND ITS TRANSITION FOR XSERVE WAS COMPLETED IN NOVEMBER 2006. THIS

TRANSITION HAS BEEN AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDING THE TIMELY INNOVATION AND DELIVERY OF RELATED HARDWARE

AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO SUPPORT INTEL MICROPROCESSORS, MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF

INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, AND THE DEVELOPMENT AND AVAILABILITY ON

ACCEPTABLE TERMS OF COMPONENTS AND SERVICES ESSENTIAL TO ENABLE THE COMPANY TO

TIMELY DELIVER INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS

DEPENDENT ON THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS SUCH AS MICROSOFT AND ADOBE TO

TIMELY DEVELOP CURRENT AND FUTURE APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON INTEL-BASED

MACINTOSH COMPUTERS. UNIVERSAL VERSIONS OF MICROSOFT OFFICE AND ADOBES

CREATIVE SUITE APPLICATIONS ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. ADDITIONALLY,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO MAINTAIN ITS

24

HISTORICAL GROSS MARGIN

PERCENTAGES ON ITS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, WHICH

MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS FROM TIME TO TIME EXPERIENCE

QUALITY PROBLEMS THAT CAN RESULT IN DECREASED NET SALES AND OPERATING PROFITS.

THE COMPANY SELLS HIGHLY

COMPLEX HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT CAN CONTAIN DEFECTS IN DESIGN AND

MANUFACTURE. SOPHISTICATED OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS

THOSE SOLD BY THE COMPANY, OFTEN CONTAIN BUGS THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE

WITH THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE. DEFECTS MAY ALSO OCCUR IN COMPONENTS AND

PRODUCTS THE COMPANY PURCHASES FROM THIRD-PARTIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT AND FIX ALL DEFECTS IN THE HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE IT SELLS. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE, LOSS OF

REPUTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT WARRANTY AND OTHER EXPENSE TO REMEDY.

BECAUSE ORDERS FOR COMPONENTS, AND IN SOME CASES

COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE COMPONENTS, MUST BE PLACED IN ADVANCE OF CUSTOMER

ORDERS, THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY RISK.

THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR INVENTORIES OF

COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THAT HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR ARE IN EXCESS OF

ANTICIPATED DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AND ACCRUES NECESSARY RESERVES FOR

CANCELLATION FEES FOR ORDERS OF PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

CANCELLED. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS INVENTORY AND RELATED PROVISIONS

ARE CURRENTLY ADEQUATE, GIVEN THE RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT

OBSOLESCENCE IN THE COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES AND THE

TRANSITION TO INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT

THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL INVENTORY AND RELATED CHARGES. IN

ADDITION, SUCH CHARGES HAVE HAD, AND MAY HAVE, A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER

COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT

SHIPMENTS. BECAUSE THE COMPANYS MARKETS ARE VOLATILE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID

TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, AND BECAUSE OF THE TRANSITION TO INTEL-BASED

MACINTOSH COMPUTERS, THERE IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND

PRODUCE OR ORDER FROM THIRD PARTIES EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF

PARTICULAR PRODUCTS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, COMPONENTS ARE NORMALLY

ACQUIRED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, AND OPEN

ORDERS BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND INFORMATION. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

TYPICALLY COVER THE COMPANYS FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING

REQUIREMENTS FOR PERIODS RANGING FROM 30 TO 150 DAYS. THE COMPANYS OPERATING

RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND MAY IN THE FUTURE BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY

LEVELS AND RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON MANUFACTURING AND

LOGISTICS SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES, MANY OF WHOM ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE

OF THE U.S.

MOST OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN

WHOLE OR IN PART BY THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS

OUTSOURCED MUCH OF ITS TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT. WHILE OUTSOURCING

ARRANGEMENTS MAY LOWER THE COST OF OPERATIONS, THEY ALSO REDUCE THE COMPANYS

DIRECT CONTROL OVER PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT EFFECT

SUCH DIMINISHED CONTROL WILL HAVE ON THE QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF THE PRODUCTS

MANUFACTURED OR SERVICES RENDERED, OR THE FLEXIBILITY OF THE COMPANY TO RESPOND

TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS RELIANT ON

THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS TO ADHERE TO THE COMPANYS SUPPLIER CODE OF CONDUCT. MOREOVER,

ALTHOUGH ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUCH MANUFACTURERS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR

WARRANTY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT, THE COMPANY MAY REMAIN AT LEAST INITIALLY

RESPONSIBLE TO THE CONSUMER FOR WARRANTY SERVICE IN THE EVENT OF PRODUCT

DEFECTS. ANY UNANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEFECT OR WARRANTY LIABILITY, WHETHER

PURSUANT TO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR OTHERWISE, COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

25

FINAL ASSEMBLY OF PRODUCTS

SOLD BY THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED IN THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING

FACILITY IN CORK, IRELAND, AND BY EXTERNAL VENDORS IN FREMONT, CALIFORNIA;

FULLERTON, CALIFORNIA; TAIWAN; THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA; THE PEOPLES REPUBLIC OF

CHINA; AND THE CZECH REPUBLIC. CURRENTLY, MANUFACTURING OF MANY OF THE

COMPONENTS USED IN THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IS PERFORMED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS

IN TAIWAN, CHINA, JAPAN, KOREA, AND SINGAPORE. FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY

ALL OF THE COMPANYS PORTABLE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MACBOOK PROS, MACBOOKS, AND

IPODS, IS PERFORMED BY THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN CHINA. IF FOR ANY REASON

MANUFACTURING OR LOGISTICS IN ANY OF THESE LOCATIONS IS DISRUPTED BY REGIONAL

ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, LABOR, ENVIRONMENTAL, PUBLIC HEALTH, OR POLITICAL ISSUES,

OR DUE TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES OR MILITARY ACTIONS, THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE IS

DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTORS AND OTHER RESELLERS OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH

WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS, AND CATALOGUERS, MANY

OF WHOM DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS FROM COMPETING MANUFACTURERS. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY SELLS MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND RESELLS CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN

MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO END-USERS, CERTAIN EDUCATION CUSTOMERS,

AND CERTAIN RESELLERS THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD AND ITS RETAIL

STORES. MANY OF THE COMPANYS RESELLERS OPERATE ON NARROW PRODUCT MARGINS AND

HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY IMPACTED IN THE PAST BY WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

CONSIDERABLE TRADE RECEIVABLES THAT ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL OR CREDIT

INSURANCE ARE OUTSTANDING WITH THE COMPANYS DISTRIBUTION AND RETAIL CHANNEL

PARTNERS. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THESE RESELLERS WEAKENS, IF RESELLERS

WITHIN CONSUMER CHANNELS WERE TO CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS,

OR IF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS CAUSED RESELLERS

TO REDUCE THEIR ORDERING AND MARKETING OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY

HAS INVESTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN VARIOUS PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE

RESELLER SALES, INCLUDING STAFFING SELECTED RESELLERS STORES WITH COMPANY

EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS. THESE PROGRAMS COULD REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL

INVESTMENT FROM THE COMPANY, WHILE PROVIDING NO ASSURANCE OF RETURN OR

INCREMENTAL REVENUE TO OFFSET THIS INVESTMENT.

OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS, AN INCREASING PROPORTION OF THE COMPANYS NET SALES HAVE BEEN MADE BY

THE COMPANY DIRECTLY TO END-USERS THROUGH ITS ONLINE STORES AROUND THE WORLD

AND THROUGH ITS RETAIL STORES IN THE U.S., CANADA, JAPAN, AND THE U.K. SOME OF

THE COMPANYS RESELLERS HAVE PERCEIVED THIS EXPANSION OF THE COMPANYS DIRECT

SALES AS CONFLICTING WITH THEIR OWN BUSINESSES AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS AS

DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. PERCEPTION OF SUCH A

CONFLICT COULD DISCOURAGE THE COMPANYS RESELLERS FROM INVESTING ADDITIONAL

RESOURCES IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS OR LEAD THEM

TO LIMIT OR CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF EXPANSION OF ITS

DIRECT SALES TO END-USERS CAUSES SOME OR ALL OF ITS RESELLERS TO CEASE OR LIMIT

DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY RELIES

ON THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH THIRD PARTIES TO OFFER

THEIR DIGITAL CONTENT TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE COMPANYS ITUNES STORE. THE

COMPANY PAYS SUBSTANTIAL FEES TO OBTAIN THE RIGHTS TO OFFER TO ITS CUSTOMERS

THIS THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT. THE COMPANYS LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH

THESE THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS ARE SHORT-TERM IN NATURE AND DO NOT GUARANTEE

THE FUTURE RENEWAL OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS AT COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS, IF

AT ALL. CERTAIN PARTIES IN THE MUSIC INDUSTRY HAVE CONSOLIDATED AND FORMED

ALLIANCES, WHICH COULD LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY AND INCREASE THE FEES REQUIRED TO

OFFER DIGITAL CONTENT TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH THE ITUNES STORE. SOME THIRD-PARTY

CONTENT PROVIDERS CURRENTLY OR MAY IN THE FUTURE OFFER MUSIC PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES THAT COMPETE WITH THE COMPANYS MUSIC PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND COULD

TAKE ACTION TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO LICENSE

THEIR DIGITAL CONTENT IN THE FUTURE. FURTHER, OTHER DISTRIBUTORS OF THIRD-PARTY

CONTENT OR THIRD-PARTY CONTENT OWNERS MAY SEEK TO LIMIT

26

THE COMPANYS ACCESS TO OR INCREASE THE TOTAL COST OF

SUCH CONTENT. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF

DIGITAL CONTENT AT REASONABLE PRICES WITH ACCEPTABLE USAGE RULES, OR CONTINUE

TO EXPAND ITS GEOGRAPHIC REACH OUTSIDE THE U.S., THEN SALES AND GROSS MARGINS

OF THE COMPANYS ITUNES STORE, AS WELL AS RELATED HARDWARE AND PERIPHERALS,

INCLUDING IPODS, MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THIRD-PARTY CONTENT

PROVIDERS AND ARTISTS REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY PROVIDE CERTAIN DIGITAL RIGHTS

MANAGEMENT (DRM) SOLUTIONS AND OTHER SECURITY MECHANISMS. IF THE REQUIREMENTS

FROM CONTENT PROVIDERS OR ARTISTS CHANGE, THEN THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO

FURTHER DEVELOP OR LICENSE TECHNOLOGY TO ADDRESS SUCH NEW RIGHTS AND

REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES HAVE PASSED LEGISLATION OR MAY

PROPOSE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD FORCE THE COMPANY TO LICENSE ITS DRM SOLUTIONS

SO THAT CONTENT WOULD BE INTEROPERABLE WITH COMPETITOR DEVICES, WHICH COULD

LESSEN THE PROTECTION OF CONTENT SUBJECTING IT TO PIRACY AND COULD AFFECT

ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE COMPANYS CONTENT SUPPLIERS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THE

COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OR LICENSE SUCH SOLUTIONS AT A REASONABLE COST

AND IN A TIMELY MANNER, IF AT ALL, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE PERFORMANCE IS DEPENDENT UPON

SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. IF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS CEASE TO BE DEVELOPED OR AVAILABLE FOR THE COMPANYS HARDWARE

PRODUCTS, THEN CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE NOT TO BUY THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES DECISIONS BY CUSTOMERS TO

PURCHASE THE COMPANYS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, AS OPPOSED TO WINDOWS-BASED

SYSTEMS, ARE OFTEN BASED ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MICROSOFT OFFICE. THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES THE

AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS

HARDWARE PRODUCTS DEPENDS IN PART ON THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS PERCEPTION

AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING, MAINTAINING, AND UPGRADING

SUCH SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS VERSUS SOFTWARE FOR THE LARGER WINDOWS

MARKET OR GROWING LINUX MARKET. THIS ANALYSIS MAY BE BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS

THE PERCEIVED STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTS, THE ANTICIPATED

POTENTIAL REVENUE THAT MAY BE GENERATED, CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE BY CUSTOMERS OF MAC

OS X, AND THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING SUCH SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT THE

MINORITY MARKET SHARE HELD BY THE COMPANY IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET HAS

CAUSED SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO QUESTION THE COMPANYS PROSPECTS IN THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER MARKET, DEVELOPERS COULD BE LESS INCLINED TO DEVELOP NEW APPLICATION

SOFTWARE OR UPGRADE EXISTING SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND MORE

INCLINED TO DEVOTE THEIR RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING AND UPGRADING SOFTWARE FOR THE

LARGER WINDOWS MARKET OR GROWING LINUX MARKET. THE COMPANYS RECENT

ANNOUNCEMENT THAT IT PLANS TO ADD A FEATURE TO THE NEXT VERSION OF MAC OS X

THAT WILL ENABLE INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH SYSTEMS TO RUN WINDOWS XP MAY DETER

DEVELOPERS FROM CREATING SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR MAC OS X IF SUCH

APPLICATIONS ARE AVAILABLE FOR THE WINDOWS PLATFORM. MOREOVER, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE FOR MAC OS X ON

A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL.

IN JUNE 2005, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS PLAN TO

BEGIN USING INTEL MICROPROCESSORS IN ITS COMPUTERS. DURING 2006, THE COMPANY

INTRODUCED NEW INTEL-BASED MODELS OF THE MACBOOK PRO, MACBOOK, MAC PRO, IMAC,

AND MAC MINI COMPUTERS. THE COMPANYS TRANSITION TO INTEL MICROPROCESSORS FOR

MACINTOSH SYSTEMS WAS COMPLETED IN AUGUST 2006, AND ITS TRANSITION FOR

XSERVE WAS COMPLETED IN NOVEMBER 2006. THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THIRD-PARTY

SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS TO TIMELY DEVELOP CURRENT AND FUTURE APPLICATIONS THAT RUN

ON INTEL MICROPROCESSORS. UNIVERSAL VERSIONS OF MICROSOFT OFFICE AND ADOBES

CREATIVE SUITE APPLICATIONS ARE NOT CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE LACK OF

APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH SYSTEMS, INCLUDING MICROSOFT

OFFICE AND ADOBE CREATIVE SUITE, COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN ADDITION, PAST AND

FUTURE DEVELOPMENT BY THE COMPANY OF ITS OWN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND

SOLUTIONS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE DECISION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS, SUCH AS

MICROSOFT AND ADOBE, TO DEVELOP, MAINTAIN, AND UPGRADE SIMILAR OR COMPETITIVE SOFTWARE

FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY MARKETS AND SELLS A VARIETY

OF SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR USE BY PROFESSIONALS, CONSUMERS, AND EDUCATION

CUSTOMERS THAT COULD INFLUENCE THE DECISIONS OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS

TO DEVELOP OR

27

UPGRADE

MACINTOSH-COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS CURRENTLY

MARKETED BY THE COMPANY INCLUDE SOFTWARE FOR PROFESSIONAL FILM AND VIDEO

EDITING, PROFESSIONAL COMPOSITING AND VISUAL EFFECTS FOR LARGE FORMAT FILM AND

VIDEO PRODUCTIONS, PROFESSIONAL MUSIC PRODUCTION AND MUSIC POST PRODUCTION,

PROFESSIONAL AND CONSUMER DVD ENCODING AND AUTHORING, PROFESSIONAL DIGITAL

PHOTO EDITING AND WORKFLOW MANAGEMENT, CONSUMER DIGITAL VIDEO AND DIGITAL PHOTO

EDITING AND MANAGEMENT, DIGITAL MUSIC MANAGEMENT, DESKTOP-BASED DATABASE

MANAGEMENT, WORD PROCESSING, AND HIGH-QUALITY PRESENTATIONS. DISCONTINUANCE OF

THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE PRODUCTS FOR THE MACINTOSH PLATFORM COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS NET SALES AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS RELIES ON ACCESS TO PATENTS AND

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES, AND THE COMPANYS FUTURE

RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF IT IS ALLEGED OR FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED

ON THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS.

MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OBTAINED FROM THIRD PARTIES. WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN

THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS

PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT BASED UPON PAST

EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON

COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE OR AVAILABLE ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS.

BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGICAL

CHANGES IN THE COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES, CURRENT EXTENSIVE

PATENT COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE

CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY

UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE EXISTING PATENTS OF OTHERS. THE COMPANY HAS FROM TIME TO

TIME BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING CERTAIN PATENTS OR OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS. RESPONDING TO SUCH CLAIMS, REGARDLESS

OF THEIR MERIT, CAN BE TIME-CONSUMING, RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, AND

CAUSE THE DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT AND TECHNICAL PERSONNEL. SEVERAL PENDING

CLAIMS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EVALUATION. THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER THE

DESIRABILITY OF ENTERING INTO LICENSING AGREEMENTS IN CERTAIN OF THESE CASES.

HOWEVER, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON

ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR THAT LITIGATION WILL NOT OCCUR. IN THE EVENT THERE IS A

TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION ENTERED PROHIBITING THE COMPANY FROM

MARKETING OR SELLING CERTAIN OF ITS PRODUCTS OR A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM OF

INFRINGEMENT AGAINST THE COMPANY REQUIRING IT TO PAY ROYALTIES TO A

THIRD-PARTY, THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. INFORMATION REGARDING CERTAIN CLAIMS AND

LITIGATION INVOLVING THE COMPANY RELATED TO ALLEGED PATENT INFRINGEMENT AND

OTHER MATTERS IS SET FORTH IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

IN THE OPINION OF MANAGEMENT, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY

FOR DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES FROM ANY CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS RELATED

TO THE INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS

THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON

ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. HOWEVER, THE RESULTS OF SUCH

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL

TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THE MATTERS RELATED TO INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS

FORM 10-K OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR

REPORTING PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANYS RETAIL INITIATIVE HAS REQUIRED AND WILL

CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT AND COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES AND IS

SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD

OPENED 165 RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANYS RETAIL INITIATIVE HAS REQUIRED

SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, INFORMATION

SYSTEMS, INVENTORY, AND PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO ENTERED INTO

SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS FOR RETAIL SPACE WITH LEASE TERMS

RANGING FROM 5 TO 20 YEARS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE FOR 10 YEARS. THE COMPANY

COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS SHOULD IT CHOOSE TO TERMINATE THESE COMMITMENTS

OR CLOSE INDIVIDUAL STORES. SUCH COSTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. ADDITIONALLY, A RELATIVELY HIGH

PROPORTION OF THE RETAIL SEGMENTS COSTS ARE FIXED BECAUSE OF PERSONNEL COSTS,

28

DEPRECIATION OF STORE CONSTRUCTION COSTS, AND LEASE

EXPENSE. AS A RESULT, SIGNIFICANT LOSSES WOULD RESULT SHOULD THE RETAIL SEGMENT

EXPERIENCE A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN SALES FOR ANY REASON.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS STORES

HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SERVE AS HIGH-PROFILE VENUES THAT

FUNCTION

AS VEHICLES FOR GENERAL CORPORATE MARKETING, CORPORATE EVENTS, AND BRAND

AWARENESS. BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN ELEMENTS, LOCATIONS AND SIZE, THESE

STORES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVESTMENT IN

EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS THAN THE COMPANYS MORE TYPICAL

RETAIL STORES. THE COMPANY HAS OPENED EIGHT SUCH STORES THROUGH SEPTEMBER 2006.

BECAUSE OF THEIR LOCATION AND SIZE, THESE HIGH-PROFILE STORES ALSO REQUIRE THE

COMPANY TO ENTER INTO SUBSTANTIALLY LARGER OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS COMPARED

TO THOSE REQUIRED FOR ITS MORE TYPICAL STORES. CURRENT LEASES ON SUCH LOCATIONS

HAVE TERMS RANGING FROM 10 TO 14 YEARS WITH TOTAL REMAINING COMMITMENTS PER LOCATION

RANGING FROM $4 MILLION TO $33 MILLION. CLOSURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE OF ONE OF

THESE HIGH-PROFILE STORES COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

MANY OF THE GENERAL RISKS

AND UNCERTAINTIES THE COMPANY FACES COULD ALSO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS

RETAIL SEGMENT. ALSO, MANY FACTORS UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS PRESENT

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES,

SOME OF WHICH

ARE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RETAIL

SEGMENTS FUTURE RESULTS, CAUSE ITS ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER FROM THOSE

CURRENTLY EXPECTED, AND/OR HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. POTENTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES UNIQUE TO RETAIL

OPERATIONS THAT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE RETAIL SEGMENT INCLUDE,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON

GENERAL RETAIL ACTIVITY; INABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STORE

CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION; INABILITY TO SELL THIRD-PARTY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE

PRODUCTS AT ADEQUATE MARGINS; FAILURE TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING

RETAIL CHANNEL PARTNERS; LACK OF EXPERIENCE IN MANAGING RETAIL OPERATIONS

OUTSIDE THE U.S.; COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE

OF APPLE-BRANDED AND THIRD-PARTY RETAIL INVENTORY; AND INABILITY TO OBTAIN AND

RENEW LEASES IN QUALITY RETAIL LOCATIONS AT A REASONABLE COST.

INVESTMENT IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES

COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANYS ONGOING BUSINESS AND MAY PRESENT RISKS NOT ORIGINALLY

CONTEMPLATED.

THE COMPANY HAS AND MAY IN

THE FUTURE INVEST IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES OR ENGAGE IN ACQUISITIONS THAT

COMPLEMENT THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC DIRECTION AND PRODUCT ROADMAP. SUCH

ENDEAVORS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING

DISTRACTION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION AWAY FROM CURRENT BUSINESS OPERATIONS;

INSUFFICIENT REVENUE GENERATION TO OFFSET LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND EXPENSES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRATEGY; AND UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES NOT DISCOVERED IN THE

COMPANYS DUE DILIGENCE PROCESS. BECAUSE THESE NEW VENTURES ARE INHERENTLY

RISKY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES WILL BE

SUCCESSFUL AND WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS BUSINESS,

OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DECLINES IN THE SALES OF THE COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL

PRODUCTS, SOFTWARE, ACCESSORIES, OR SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS, OR INCREASES

IN SALES OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS, INCLUDING IPODS, MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE

COMPANYS GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES.

THE COMPANYS PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS, INCLUDING MACBOOK

PRO AND MAC PRO SYSTEMS, SOFTWARE, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT

CONTRACTS, GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER GROSS MARGINS THAN THE COMPANYS CONSUMER

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE IMAC, MAC MINI, MACBOOK, IPOD, AND CONTENT FROM THE

ITUNES STORE. A SHIFT IN SALES MIX AWAY FROM HIGHER MARGIN PROFESSIONAL

PRODUCTS TOWARDS LOWER MARGIN CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS FUTURE GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES. THE COMPANYS

TRADITIONAL PROFESSIONAL CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE TO BUY CONSUMER PRODUCTS,

SPECIFICALLY THE IMAC AND MACBOOK, INSTEAD OF PROFESSIONAL PRODUCTS.

PROFESSIONAL USERS MAY CHOOSE TO BUY THE IMAC DUE TO ITS RELATIVE PRICE

PERFORMANCE AND UNIQUE DESIGN FEATURING A FLAT PANEL SCREEN. PROFESSIONAL USERS

MAY ALSO CHOOSE TO PURCHASE MACBOOKS INSTEAD OF THE COMPANYS

PROFESSIONAL-ORIENTED PORTABLE PRODUCTS DUE TO THEIR PRICE PERFORMANCE AND

SCREEN SIZE. ADDITIONALLY, SIGNIFICANT FUTURE GROWTH IN IPOD SALES WITHOUT

29

CORRESPONDING GROWTH IN HIGHER MARGIN PRODUCT SALES

COULD ALSO REDUCE GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS

ITS QUARTERLY REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE FOR A VARIETY OF

REASONS.

THE COMPANYS PROFIT

MARGINS VARY AMONG ITS PRODUCTS AND ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE COMPANYS

DIRECT SALES, PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS RETAIL AND ONLINE STORES, GENERALLY HAVE

HIGHER ASSOCIATED PROFITABILITY THAN ITS INDIRECT SALES. AS A RESULT, THE

COMPANYS GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES, AS WELL AS OVERALL

PROFITABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT,

GEOGRAPHIC OR CHANNEL MIX, OR NEW PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTS, INCLUDING THE

TRANSITION TO INTEL-BASED MACINTOSH COMPUTERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

GENERALLY SELLS MORE PRODUCT DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF EACH QUARTER THAN IT

DOES DURING EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO MONTHS, A PATTERN TYPICAL IN THE PERSONAL

COMPUTER AND CONSUMER ELECTRONICS INDUSTRIES. THIS SALES PATTERN CAN PRODUCE

PRESSURE ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL INFRASTRUCTURE DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF A

QUARTER AND MAY ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO PREDICT ITS FINANCIAL

RESULTS ACCURATELY. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY HAS TYPICALLY EXPERIENCED GREATER

NET SALES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS COMPARED TO OTHER QUARTERS IN

THE FISCAL YEAR DUE TO SEASONAL DEMAND RELATED TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND THE

BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR. DEVELOPMENTS LATE IN A QUARTER, SUCH AS

LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, AN INTERNAL SYSTEMS

FAILURE, OR FAILURE OF ONE OF THE COMPANYS KEY LOGISTICS, COMPONENTS

SUPPLIERS, OR MANUFACTURING PARTNERS, COULD HAVE SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE IMPACTS ON

THE COMPANY AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY HAS HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE, THAN

MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AND MAINTAIN ATTRACTIVE GROSS MARGINS AND REVENUE GROWTH

IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY FLOW OF

INNOVATIVE AND COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. AS A

RESULT, THE COMPANY GENERALLY INCURS HIGHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS AS A

PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE THAN ITS COMPETITORS WHO SELL PERSONAL COMPUTERS BASED ON

OTHER OPERATING SYSTEMS. MANY OF THESE COMPETITORS SEEK TO COMPETE AGGRESSIVELY

ON PRICE AND MAINTAIN VERY LOW COST STRUCTURES. FURTHER, AS A RESULT OF THE

EXPANSION OF THE COMPANYS RETAIL SEGMENT AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MARKETING

THE COMPANYS BRAND INCLUDING ITS UNIQUE OPERATING SYSTEM, THE COMPANY INCURS

HIGHER SELLING COSTS AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE THAN MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS.

IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND SELL INNOVATIVE NEW

PRODUCTS WITH ATTRACTIVE GROSS MARGINS, ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS MAY BE

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY ITS OPERATING COST STRUCTURE.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AND PREPAYMENTS RELATED TO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS. THIS RISK IS

HEIGHTENED DURING PERIODS WHEN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORSEN.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES

ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY COMPUTER RESELLERS AND RETAILERS AND DIRECTLY

TO CERTAIN EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS AND COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. A SUBSTANTIAL

MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE NOT COVERED BY

COLLATERAL OR CREDIT INSURANCE. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS UNSECURED NON-TRADE

RECEIVABLES FROM CERTAIN OF ITS MANUFACTURING VENDORS RESULTING FROM THE SALE

BY THE COMPANY OF RAW MATERIAL COMPONENTS TO THESE MANUFACTURING VENDORS WHO MANUFACTURE

SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO SECURE SUPPLY OF NAND

FLASH-MEMORY AND HAS PREPAID A TOTAL OF $1.25 BILLION UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS.

WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES IN PLACE TO MONITOR AND LIMIT EXPOSURE TO

CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE AND NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES AS WELL AS LONG-TERM

PREPAYMENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE SUCH PROCEDURES WILL BE EFFECTIVE IN

LIMITING ITS CREDIT RISK AND AVOIDING LOSSES. ADDITIONALLY, IF THE GLOBAL

ECONOMY OR REGIONAL ECONOMIES DETERIORATE, THE COMPANY WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO

INCUR A MATERIAL LOSS OR LOSSES AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF ONE OR MORE OF ITS CUSTOMERS OR MANUFACTURING VENDORS.

30

THE COMPANYS

SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

MUCH OF THE FUTURE SUCCESS

OF THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED SERVICE AND AVAILABILITY OF SKILLED

PERSONNEL, INCLUDING ITS CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER, MEMBERS OF ITS EXECUTIVE

TEAM, AND THOSE IN TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF POSITIONS. EXPERIENCED

PERSONNEL IN THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND

COMPETITION FOR THEIR TALENTS IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY,

WHERE THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS KEY EMPLOYEES ARE LOCATED. THE COMPANY HAS

RELIED ON ITS ABILITY TO GRANT STOCK OPTIONS AS ONE MECHANISM FOR RECRUITING

AND RETAINING THIS HIGHLY SKILLED TALENT. RECENT ACCOUNTING REGULATIONS

REQUIRING THE EXPENSING OF STOCK OPTIONS HAVE RESULTED IN INCREASED STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE, WHICH MAY CAUSE THE COMPANY TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF

STOCK-BASED AWARDS ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT

TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVAILABILITY AND COVERAGE OF INSURANCE.

FOR CERTAIN RISKS, THE

COMPANY DOES NOT MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE BECAUSE OF COST AND/OR

AVAILABILITY. BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS SOME PORTION OF ITS INSURABLE RISKS,

AND IN SOME CASES SELF INSURES COMPLETELY, UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC LOSSES IN

EXCESS OF INSURED LIMITS MAY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

FAILURE OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS AND BREACHES

IN THE SECURITY OF DATA UPON WHICH THE COMPANY RELIES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

SYSTEM FAILURES AND BREACHES OF DATA SECURITY COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO FUNCTION IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS BY POTENTIALLY CAUSING

DELAYS OR CANCELLATION OF CUSTOMER ORDERS, IMPEDING THE MANUFACTURE OR SHIPMENT

OF PRODUCTS, OR RESULTING IN THE UNINTENTIONAL DISCLOSURE OF CUSTOMER OR

COMPANY INFORMATION. MANAGEMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS FOR ITS

OWN SYSTEMS BY IMPLEMENTING SOPHISTICATED NETWORK SECURITY AND INTERNAL CONTROL

MEASURES. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A SYSTEM FAILURE OR DATA

SECURITY BREACH OF THE COMPANY OR A THIRD-PARTY VENDOR WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

A LARGE PORTION OF THE COMPANYS REVENUE IS DERIVED

FROM ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANYS OPERATING RESULTS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING ECONOMIC AND LABOR CONDITIONS,

POLITICAL INSTABILITY, TAX LAWS (INCLUDING U.S. TAXES ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES),

AND CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS THE LOCAL CURRENCY IN WHICH

THE PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AND GOODS AND SERVICES ARE PURCHASED. THE COMPANYS

PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATE TO

NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SALES IN EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CANADA, AND

CERTAIN PARTS OF ASIA AND NON-DOLLAR DENOMINATED OPERATING EXPENSES INCURRED

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WEAKNESSES IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PARTICULARLY THE

JAPANESE YEN AND THE EURO, CAN ADVERSELY IMPACT CONSUMER DEMAND FOR THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY

DENOMINATED SALES. CONVERSELY, A STRENGTHENING IN THESE AND OTHER FOREIGN

CURRENCIES CAN CAUSE THE COMPANY TO MODIFY INTERNATIONAL PRICING AND AFFECT THE

VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN DENOMINATED SALES, AND IN SOME CASES, MAY ALSO

INCREASE THE COST TO THE COMPANY OF SOME PRODUCT COMPONENTS.

MARGINS ON SALES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN

COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM

FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, CAN BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE REGULATIONS, INCLUDING TARIFFS AND

ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE

FORWARD AND OPTION POSITIONS HAVE BEEN UTILIZED BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE

EXPOSURES TO FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF SUCH

HEDGING ACTIVITIES MAY NOT OFFSET MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE ADVERSE FINANCIAL

IMPACT RESULTING FROM UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.

31

FURTHER INFORMATION RELATED

TO THE COMPANYS GLOBAL MARKET RISKS MAY BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 7A OF

THIS FORM 10-K UNDER THE SUBHEADING FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK AND MAY

BE FOUND IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K AT NOTES 1 AND 3

OF NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY IS

SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.

PRODUCTION AND MARKETING

OF PRODUCTS IN CERTAIN STATES AND COUNTRIES MAY SUBJECT THE COMPANY TO

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER REGULATIONS INCLUDING, IN SOME INSTANCES, THE

REQUIREMENT TO PROVIDE CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO RETURN PRODUCT AT THE END OF

ITS USEFUL LIFE, AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR

RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE RECENTLY BEEN PASSED

IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, INCLUDING VARIOUS

EUROPEAN UNION MEMBER COUNTRIES, JAPAN AND CERTAIN STATES WITHIN THE U.S.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS IN THE

FUTURE BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE THRUST OF SUCH LAWS, THERE

IS NO ASSURANCE SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION, LIQUIDITY, OR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

CHANGES IN

ACCOUNTING RULES COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.

THESE PRINCIPLES ARE SUBJECT TO INTERPRETATION BY VARIOUS GOVERNING BODIES,

INCLUDING THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) AND THE SEC, WHO

CREATE AND INTERPRET APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. A CHANGE FROM CURRENT

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS. IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED NEW GUIDANCE THAT

ADDRESSES THE ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS, STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 123 (REVISED 2004) (SFAS NO. 123R),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

, WHICH THE COMPANY

ADOPTED IN 2006. IN 2006, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE REDUCED DILUTED

EARNINGS PER COMMON SHARE BY APPROXIMATELY $0.14. ALTHOUGH THE ADOPTION OF SFAS

NO. 123R IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FUTURE CHANGES TO VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS USED TO

DETERMINE THE FAIR-VALUE OF AWARDS ISSUED OR THE AMOUNT AND TYPE OF EQUITY

AWARDS GRANTED CREATE UNCERTAINTY AS TO THE AMOUNT OF FUTURE STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

CHANGES IN THE

COMPANYS TAX RATES COULD AFFECT ITS FUTURE RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE FAVORABLY OR UNFAVORABLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN

THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN

THE VALUATION OF THE COMPANYS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR BY

CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS

SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL

REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE

LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE

THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE

OUTCOMES FROM THESE CONTINUOUS EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANYS STOCK

PRICE MAY BE VOLATILE.

THE COMPANYS STOCK HAS AT

TIMES EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY AS A RESULT OF VARIATIONS

BETWEEN ITS ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL RESULTS AND AS A RESULT OF

ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND ITS COMPETITORS. THE STOCK MARKET HAS

EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET

PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN WAYS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN UNRELATED TO THE

OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF THESE COMPANIES. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS

STOCK PRICE REFLECTS HIGH FUTURE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY EXPECTATIONS. IF THE

COMPANY FAILS TO MEET THESE EXPECTATIONS ITS STOCK PRICE MAY SIGNIFICANTLY

DECLINE. IN ADDITION, INCREASES IN THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE MAY RESULT IN

GREATER DILUTION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE.
