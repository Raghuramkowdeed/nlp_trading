RISK FACTORS

BECAUSE OF

THE FOLLOWING FACTORS, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS AFFECTING THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS, PAST FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE, AND INVESTORS SHOULD NOT

USE HISTORICAL TRENDS TO ANTICIPATE RESULTS OR TRENDS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND PERFORMANCE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

UNCERTAINTY ABOUT CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS POSES A RISK AS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES MAY CONTINUE TO POSTPONE SPENDING IN RESPONSE TO TIGHTER CREDIT, UNEMPLOYMENT, NEGATIVE FINANCIAL NEWS AND/OR DECLINES IN INCOME OR ASSET VALUES,

WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL NEGATIVE EFFECT ON DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. DEMAND ALSO COULD DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE COMPANYS EXPECTATIONS SINCE THE COMPANY GENERALLY RAISES PRICES ON GOODS AND SERVICES SOLD OUTSIDE

THE U.S. TO OFFSET THE EFFECT OF A STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR. OTHER FACTORS THAT COULD INFLUENCE DEMAND INCLUDE INCREASES IN FUEL AND OTHER ENERGY COSTS, CONDITIONS IN THE REAL ESTATE AND MORTGAGE MARKETS, LABOR AND HEALTHCARE COSTS, ACCESS

TO CREDIT, CONSUMER CONFIDENCE, AND OTHER MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AFFECTING CONSUMER SPENDING BEHAVIOR. THESE AND OTHER ECONOMIC FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE EVENT OF

RENEWED FINANCIAL TURMOIL AFFECTING THE BANKING SYSTEM AND FINANCIAL MARKETS, ADDITIONAL CONSOLIDATION OF THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY, OR SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL SERVICE INSTITUTION FAILURES, THERE COULD BE A NEW OR INCREMENTAL TIGHTENING IN

THE CREDIT MARKETS, LOW LIQUIDITY, AND EXTREME VOLATILITY IN FIXED INCOME, CREDIT, CURRENCY, AND EQUITY MARKETS. IN ADDITION, THE RISK REMAINS THAT THERE COULD BE A NUMBER OF FOLLOW-ON EFFECTS FROM THE CREDIT CRISIS ON THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS, INCLUDING THE INSOLVENCY OF KEY OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURING PARTNERS OR SUPPLIERS OR THEIR INABILITY TO OBTAIN CREDIT TO FINANCE DEVELOPMENT AND/OR MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS RESULTING IN PRODUCT DELAYS; INABILITY OF CUSTOMERS,

INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS, TO OBTAIN CREDIT TO FINANCE PURCHASES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND/OR CUSTOMER, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNER, INSOLVENCIES; AND FAILURE OF DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS NEGATIVELY

IMPACTING THE COMPANYS TREASURY OPERATIONS. OTHER INCOME AND EXPENSE ALSO COULD VARY MATERIALLY FROM EXPECTATIONS DEPENDING ON GAINS OR LOSSES REALIZED ON THE SALE OR EXCHANGE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS; IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RESULTING

FROM REVALUATIONS OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS; INTEREST RATES; CASH BALANCES; AND CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. INCREASED VOLATILITY IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS AND OVERALL

ECONOMIC UNCERTAINTY WOULD INCREASE THE RISK OF THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS REALIZED IN THE FUTURE ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DIFFERING SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE FAIR VALUES CURRENTLY ASSIGNED TO THEM.

UNCERTAINTY ABOUT CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO CONTINUE TO INCREASE THE VOLATILITY OF THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE.

GLOBAL MARKETS FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL

CHANGE. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN THESE MARKETS, ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY COMPETES IN HIGHLY COMPETITIVE GLOBAL MARKETS CHARACTERIZED BY AGGRESSIVE PRICE CUTTING, WITH RESULTING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON GROSS MARGINS, FREQUENT INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS, SHORT PRODUCT

LIFE CYCLES, EVOLVING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT IN PRODUCT PRICE/PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS, RAPID ADOPTION OF TECHNOLOGICAL AND PRODUCT ADVANCEMENTS BY COMPETITORS, AND PRICE SENSITIVITY ON THE PART OF CONSUMERS.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY DEPENDS HEAVILY ON ITS ABILITY TO ENSURE A CONTINUING AND TIMELY INTRODUCTION OF

INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS AND TECHNOLOGIES TO THE MARKETPLACE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS UNIQUE IN THAT IT DESIGNS AND DEVELOPS NEARLY THE ENTIRE SOLUTION FOR ITS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE HARDWARE, OPERATING SYSTEM, NUMEROUS SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, AND

RELATED SERVICES. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY MUST MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND AS SUCH, THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HOLDS A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF PATENTS AND COPYRIGHTS AND HAS REGISTERED AND/OR HAS APPLIED TO REGISTER

NUMEROUS PATENTS, TRADEMARKS AND SERVICE MARKS. BY CONTRAST, MANY OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS SEEK TO COMPETE PRIMARILY THROUGH AGGRESSIVE PRICING AND VERY LOW COST STRUCTURES. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND SELL

INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS WITH ATTRACTIVE MARGINS OR IF OTHER COMPANIES INFRINGE ON THE COMPANYS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED AND ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

IN THE MARKET FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS AND PERIPHERALS, THE COMPANY

FACES A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPETITORS, MANY OF WHICH HAVE BROADER PRODUCT LINES, LOWER PRICED PRODUCTS, AND LARGER INSTALLED CUSTOMER BASES. CONSOLIDATION IN THIS MARKET HAS RESULTED IN LARGER AND POTENTIALLY STRONGER COMPETITORS. PRICE

COMPETITION HAS BEEN PARTICULARLY INTENSE AS COMPETITORS SELLING WINDOWS-BASED PERSONAL COMPUTERS HAVE AGGRESSIVELY CUT PRICES AND LOWERED PRODUCT MARGINS. THE COMPANY ALSO FACES INCREASED COMPETITION IN KEY MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING CONSUMER, SMB,

EDUCATION, ENTERPRISE, GOVERNMENT AND CREATIVE MARKETS. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF INTERNET DEVICES THAT INCLUDE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND ARE SMALLER AND SIMPLER THAN TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS COMPETE FOR MARKET SHARE WITH THE COMPANYS

EXISTING PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY THE ONLY AUTHORIZED MAKER OF HARDWARE USING THE MAC OS. THE MAC OS HAS A MINORITY

MARKET SHARE IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET, WHICH IS DOMINATED BY COMPUTER MAKERS USING COMPETING OPERATING SYSTEMS, MOST NOTABLY WINDOWS. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND SUBSTANTIALLY ON THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY IMPROVE THE MAC PLATFORM TO MAINTAIN FUNCTIONAL AND

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DESIGN ADVANTAGES. USE OF UNAUTHORIZED COPIES OF THE MAC OS ON OTHER COMPANIES HARDWARE PRODUCTS MAY RESULT IN DECREASED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS, AND COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY MARKETS

CERTAIN MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES, AND THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT TECHNICAL, MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER RESOURCES, AS WELL AS

ESTABLISHED HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND DIGITAL CONTENT SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY FACES SIGNIFICANT PRICE COMPETITION AS COMPETITORS REDUCE THEIR SELLING PRICES AND ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THE COMPANYS PRODUCT FEATURES AND

APPLICATIONS WITHIN THEIR OWN PRODUCTS OR, ALTERNATIVELY, COLLABORATE WITH EACH OTHER TO OFFER SOLUTIONS THAT ARE MORE COMPETITIVE THAN THOSE THEY CURRENTLY OFFER. THE COMPANY ALSO COMPETES WITH ILLEGITIMATE WAYS TO OBTAIN THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL

CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS ONLY RECENTLY ENTERED THE MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA DEVICE MARKETS, AND MANY OF ITS COMPETITORS IN THESE MARKETS HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY GREATER EXPERIENCE, PRODUCT BREADTH AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS THAN

THE COMPANY. BECAUSE SOME CURRENT AND POTENTIAL COMPETITORS HAVE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES AND/OR EXPERIENCE AND A LOWER COST STRUCTURE, THEY MAY BE ABLE TO PROVIDE SUCH PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AT LITTLE OR NO PROFIT OR EVEN AT A LOSS. THE COMPANY ALSO

EXPECTS COMPETITION TO INTENSIFY AS COMPETITORS ATTEMPT TO IMITATE THE COMPANYS APPROACH TO PROVIDING THESE COMPONENTS SEAMLESSLY WITHIN THEIR INDIVIDUAL OFFERINGS OR WORK COLLABORATIVELY TO OFFER INTEGRATED SOLUTIONS.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY RECEIVES SUBSIDIES FROM ITS EXCLUSIVE AND NON-EXCLUSIVE CARRIERS PROVIDING CELLULAR NETWORK SERVICE FOR IPHONE.

THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT SUCH SUBSIDIES WILL BE CONTINUED AT ALL OR IN THE SAME AMOUNTS UPON RENEWAL OF THE COMPANYS AGREEMENTS WITH THESE CARRIERS OR IN AGREEMENTS THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO WITH NEW CARRIERS.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO CONTINUE TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT COMPETE EFFECTIVELY.

TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE AND STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND, THE COMPANY MUST SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE FREQUENT PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND

TRANSITIONS.

DUE TO THE HIGHLY VOLATILE AND COMPETITIVE NATURE OF THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES, THE

COMPANY MUST CONTINUALLY INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES, ENHANCE EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND EFFECTIVELY STIMULATE CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR NEW AND UPGRADED PRODUCTS. THE SUCCESS OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER

OF FACTORS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO TIMELY AND SUCCESSFUL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET ACCEPTANCE, THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE THE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTION RAMP ISSUES, THE AVAILABILITY OF APPLICATION SOFTWARE

FOR NEW PRODUCTS, THE EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND INVENTORY LEVELS IN LINE WITH ANTICIPATED PRODUCT DEMAND, THE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN APPROPRIATE QUANTITIES AND COSTS TO MEET ANTICIPATED DEMAND, AND THE RISK THAT NEW

PRODUCTS MAY HAVE QUALITY OR OTHER DEFECTS IN THE EARLY STAGES OF INTRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE IN ADVANCE THE ULTIMATE EFFECT OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS AND TRANSITIONS ON ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY FACES SUBSTANTIAL INVENTORY AND OTHER ASSET RISK IN ADDITION TO PURCHASE COMMITMENT CANCELLATION RISK.

THE COMPANY RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN FOR PRODUCT AND COMPONENT INVENTORIES THAT HAVE BECOME OBSOLETE OR EXCEED ANTICIPATED

DEMAND OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE AND ACCRUES NECESSARY CANCELLATION FEE RESERVES FOR ORDERS OF EXCESS PRODUCTS AND COMPONENTS. THE COMPANY ALSO REVIEWS ITS LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGED CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF AN ASSET MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE COMPANY DETERMINES THAT IMPAIRMENT HAS OCCURRED, IT RECORDS A WRITE-DOWN EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS EXCEEDS ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS

PROVISIONS RELATED TO INVENTORY, OTHER ASSETS AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS ARE CURRENTLY ADEQUATE, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT INCUR ADDITIONAL RELATED CHARGES GIVEN THE RAPID AND UNPREDICTABLE PACE OF PRODUCT OBSOLESCENCE IN THE

INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES. SUCH CHARGES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY MUST ORDER

COMPONENTS FOR ITS PRODUCTS AND BUILD INVENTORY IN ADVANCE OF PRODUCT ANNOUNCEMENTS AND SHIPMENTS. CONSISTENT WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, COMPONENTS ARE NORMALLY ACQUIRED THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PURCHASE ORDERS, SUPPLIER CONTRACTS, OPEN ORDERS AND,

WHERE APPROPRIATE, PREPAYMENTS, IN EACH CASE BASED ON PROJECTED DEMAND. SUCH PURCHASE COMMITMENTS TYPICALLY COVER FORECASTED COMPONENT AND MANUFACTURING REQUIREMENTS FOR 30 TO 150 DAYS. BECAUSE THE COMPANYS MARKETS ARE VOLATILE, COMPETITIVE

AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGY AND PRICE CHANGES, THERE IS A RISK THE COMPANY WILL FORECAST INCORRECTLY AND ORDER OR PRODUCE EXCESS OR INSUFFICIENT INVENTORIES OF COMPONENTS OR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS

HAVE BEEN IN THE PAST AND COULD BE IN THE FUTURE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS INVENTORY LEVELS AND RESPOND TO SHORT-TERM SHIFTS IN CUSTOMER DEMAND PATTERNS.

FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS DEPEND UPON THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MICROPROCESSORS,

NAND FLASH MEMORY, DRAM AND LCDS AT FAVORABLE PRICES AND IN SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY CURRENTLY OBTAINS

CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MICROPROCESSORS, ENCLOSURES, CERTAIN LCDS, CERTAIN OPTICAL DRIVES, AND ASICS, FROM SINGLE OR LIMITED SOURCES, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT SUPPLY AND PRICING RISKS. MANY OF THESE AND OTHER

KEY COMPONENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO NAND FLASH MEMORY, DRAM AND CERTAIN LCDS, ARE SUBJECT AT TIMES TO INDUSTRY-WIDE SHORTAGES AND SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY PRICING FLUCTUATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED

INTO CERTAIN AGREEMENTS FOR THE SUPPLY OF KEY COMPONENTS INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO MICROPROCESSORS, NAND FLASH MEMORY, DRAM AND LCDS AT FAVORABLE PRICING, BUT THERE IS NO GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO EXTEND OR RENEW THESE AGREEMENTS

ON SIMILAR FAVORABLE TERMS, OR AT ALL, UPON EXPIRATION OR OTHERWISE OBTAIN FAVORABLE PRICING IN THE FUTURE. THE FOLLOW-ON EFFECTS FROM THE CREDIT CRISIS ON THE COMPANYS KEY SUPPLIERS, REFERRED TO IN 

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY

ABOVE, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE, ALSO COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN KEY COMPONENTS.

THEREFORE, THE COMPANY REMAINS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS OF SUPPLY

SHORTAGES AND/OR PRICE INCREASES THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO EXPERIENCE DECREASES IN ITS GROSS MARGIN PERCENTAGE IN FUTURE PERIODS, AS COMPARED TO LEVELS

ACHIEVED DURING 2010, LARGELY DUE TO A HIGHER MIX OF NEW AND INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE HIGHER COST STRUCTURES AND DELIVER GREATER VALUE TO CUSTOMERS, AND EXPECTED AND POTENTIAL FUTURE COMPONENT COST AND OTHER COST INCREASES. FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION REFER TO PART II, ITEM 7, MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, UNDER THE SUBHEADING GROSS MARGIN, WHICH IS INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

THE COMPANY AND OTHER PARTICIPANTS IN THE PERSONAL COMPUTER, AND MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICE INDUSTRIES COMPETE FOR VARIOUS

COMPONENTS WITH OTHER INDUSTRIES THAT HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASED DEMAND FOR THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY USES SOME CUSTOM COMPONENTS THAT ARE NOT COMMON TO THE REST OF THESE INDUSTRIES. THE COMPANYS NEW PRODUCTS OFTEN UTILIZE CUSTOM COMPONENTS

AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE SOURCE. WHEN A COMPONENT OR PRODUCT USES NEW TECHNOLOGIES, INITIAL CAPACITY CONSTRAINTS MAY EXIST UNTIL THE SUPPLIERS YIELDS HAVE MATURED OR MANUFACTURING CAPACITY HAS INCREASED. CONTINUED AVAILABILITY OF THESE

COMPONENTS AT ACCEPTABLE PRICES, OR AT ALL, MAY BE AFFECTED IF THOSE SUPPLIERS DECIDED TO CONCENTRATE ON THE PRODUCTION OF COMMON COMPONENTS INSTEAD OF COMPONENTS CUSTOMIZED TO MEET THE COMPANYS REQUIREMENTS. IF THE SUPPLY OF A KEY

SINGLE-SOURCED COMPONENT FOR A NEW OR EXISTING PRODUCT WERE DELAYED OR CONSTRAINED, IF SUCH COMPONENTS WERE AVAILABLE ONLY AT SIGNIFICANTLY HIGHER PRICES, OR IF A KEY MANUFACTURING VENDOR DELAYED SHIPMENTS OF COMPLETED PRODUCTS TO THE COMPANY, THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON

COMPONENT AND PRODUCT MANUFACTURING AND LOGISTICAL SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES, MANY OF WHOM ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS ARE MANUFACTURED IN WHOLE OR IN PART BY A FEW THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS. MANY OF THESE MANUFACTURERS ARE LOCATED OUTSIDE OF THE U.S., AND

ARE CONCENTRATED IN SEVERAL GENERAL LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO OUTSOURCED MUCH OF ITS TRANSPORTATION AND LOGISTICS MANAGEMENT. WHILE THESE ARRANGEMENTS MAY LOWER OPERATING COSTS, THEY ALSO REDUCE THE COMPANYS DIRECT CONTROL OVER

PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHAT EFFECT SUCH DIMINISHED CONTROL WILL HAVE ON THE QUALITY OR QUANTITY OF

13

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR THE COMPANYS FLEXIBILITY TO RESPOND TO CHANGING CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RELIES ON THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURERS TO ADHERE TO THE COMPANYS SUPPLIER

CODE OF CONDUCT. ALTHOUGH ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUCH MANUFACTURERS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR WARRANTY EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT, THE COMPANY MAY REMAIN RESPONSIBLE TO THE CONSUMER FOR WARRANTY SERVICE IN THE EVENT OF PRODUCT DEFECTS. ANY UNANTICIPATED

PRODUCT DEFECT OR WARRANTY LIABILITY, WHETHER PURSUANT TO ARRANGEMENTS WITH CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS OR OTHERWISE, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS REPUTATION, FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

FINAL ASSEMBLY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IS CURRENTLY PERFORMED IN THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN IRELAND, AND BY

EXTERNAL VENDORS IN CALIFORNIA, TEXAS, CHINA, THE CZECH REPUBLIC AND KOREA. CURRENTLY, THE SUPPLY AND MANUFACTURE OF MANY CRITICAL COMPONENTS IS PERFORMED BY SOLE-SOURCED THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN THE U.S., CHINA, GERMANY, IRELAND, ISRAEL, JAPAN,

KOREA, MALAYSIA, THE NETHERLANDS, THE PHILIPPINES, TAIWAN, THAILAND AND SINGAPORE. SOLE-SOURCED THIRD-PARTY VENDORS IN CHINA PERFORM FINAL ASSEMBLY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS MAC PRODUCTS, IPHONES, IPADS AND IPODS. IF MANUFACTURING

OR LOGISTICS IN THESE LOCATIONS IS DISRUPTED FOR ANY REASON, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, NATURAL DISASTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES, MILITARY ACTIONS OR ECONOMIC, BUSINESS, LABOR, ENVIRONMENTAL, PUBLIC HEALTH, OR POLITICAL ISSUES,

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON

THIRD-PARTY DIGITAL CONTENT, WHICH MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE TO THE COMPANY ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

THE

COMPANY CONTRACTS WITH CERTAIN THIRD PARTIES TO OFFER THEIR DIGITAL CONTENT THROUGH THE COMPANYS ITUNES STORE. THE COMPANYS LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS WITH THESE THIRD PARTIES ARE SHORT-TERM AND DO NOT GUARANTEE THE CONTINUATION OR RENEWAL

OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS ON REASONABLE TERMS, IF AT ALL. SOME THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS CURRENTLY OR IN THE FUTURE MAY OFFER COMPETING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND COULD TAKE ACTION TO MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE COMPANY TO LICENSE

THEIR CONTENT IN THE FUTURE. OTHER CONTENT OWNERS, PROVIDERS OR DISTRIBUTORS MAY SEEK TO LIMIT THE COMPANYS ACCESS TO, OR INCREASE THE TOTAL COST OF, SUCH CONTENT. IF THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO CONTINUE TO OFFER A WIDE VARIETY OF CONTENT AT

REASONABLE PRICES WITH ACCEPTABLE USAGE RULES, OR CONTINUE TO EXPAND ITS GEOGRAPHIC REACH, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

MANY THIRD-PARTY CONTENT PROVIDERS REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY PROVIDE CERTAIN DIGITAL RIGHTS MANAGEMENT (DRM) AND OTHER

SECURITY SOLUTIONS. IF THESE REQUIREMENTS CHANGE, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO DEVELOP OR LICENSE NEW TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE THESE SOLUTIONS. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DEVELOP OR LICENSE SUCH SOLUTIONS AT A REASONABLE COST AND IN A

TIMELY MANNER. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COUNTRIES HAVE PASSED OR MAY PROPOSE LEGISLATION THAT WOULD FORCE THE COMPANY TO LICENSE ITS DRM, WHICH COULD LESSEN THE PROTECTION OF CONTENT AND SUBJECT IT TO PIRACY AND ALSO COULD AFFECT ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE

COMPANYS CONTENT PROVIDERS.

THE COMPANY RELIES ON ACCESS TO THIRD-PARTY PATENTS AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND THE

COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF IT IS ALLEGED OR FOUND TO HAVE INFRINGED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

MANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND IN THE FUTURE THE COMPANY MAY NEED TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF ITS PRODUCTS

AND BUSINESS METHODS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT, BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON REASONABLE TERMS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THE NECESSARY LICENSES WOULD BE AVAILABLE ON

ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR AT ALL.

BECAUSE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES IN THE INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY COMPETES, CURRENT

EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE, AND THE RAPID ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS MAY UNKNOWINGLY INFRINGE THE PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF THIRD PARTIES.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN NOTIFIED THAT IT MAY BE INFRINGING SUCH RIGHTS. REGARDLESS OF MERIT, RESPONDING TO SUCH CLAIMS CAN CONSUME SIGNIFICANT TIME AND EXPENSE. AT PRESENT, THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING A NUMBER OF PATENT

INFRINGEMENT CASES, AND SEVERAL PENDING CLAIMS ARE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF EVALUATION. IN CERTAIN CASES, THE COMPANY MAY CONSIDER THE DESIRABILITY OF ENTERING INTO LICENSING AGREEMENTS, ALTHOUGH NO

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH LICENSES CAN BE OBTAINED ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS OR THAT LITIGATION WILL NOT OCCUR. IF THE COMPANY IS FOUND TO BE INFRINGING SUCH RIGHTS, IT MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY

SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES. IF THERE IS A TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT INJUNCTION PROHIBITING THE COMPANY FROM MARKETING OR SELLING CERTAIN PRODUCTS OR A SUCCESSFUL CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT AGAINST THE COMPANY REQUIRES IT TO PAY ROYALTIES TO A THIRD PARTY, THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT CAN DEVELOP NON-INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY. WHILE IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A POTENTIAL LIABILITY FOR

DAMAGES OR ROYALTIES FROM ANY KNOWN CURRENT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS OR CLAIMS RELATED TO THE INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT WOULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND

OPERATING RESULTS, THE RESULTS OF SUCH LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN ANY OF THE MATTERS RELATED TO INFRINGEMENT OF PATENT OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OF OTHERS OR SHOULD SEVERAL

OF THESE MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF IPHONES AND 3G ENABLED IPADS, THE COMPANY HAS BEGUN TO COMPETE WITH MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES

COMPANIES THAT HOLD SIGNIFICANT PATENT PORTFOLIOS. REGARDLESS OF THE SCOPE OR VALIDITY OF SUCH PATENTS OR THE MERITS OF ANY POTENTIAL PATENT CLAIMS BY COMPETITORS, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO ENGAGE IN PROTRACTED LITIGATION, ENTER INTO

EXPENSIVE AGREEMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS AND/OR MODIFY ITS PRODUCTS. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE PERFORMANCE DEPENDS ON SUPPORT FROM THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. IF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS

AND SERVICES CEASE TO BE DEVELOPED AND MAINTAINED FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, CUSTOMERS MAY CHOOSE NOT TO BUY THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES DECISIONS BY CUSTOMERS TO PURCHASE ITS HARDWARE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING ITS MACS, IPHONES, IPADS AND IPODS, ARE OFTEN BASED TO A CERTAIN EXTENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES. THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ON A TIMELY BASIS OR AT ALL, AND DISCONTINUANCE OR DELAY OF THESE

APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

WITH RESPECT TO ITS MAC PRODUCTS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE AVAILABILITY OF THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES DEPENDS IN PART

ON THE DEVELOPERS PERCEPTION AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING, MAINTAINING, AND UPGRADING SUCH SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS COMPARED TO WINDOWS-BASED PRODUCTS. THIS ANALYSIS MAY BE BASED ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE

PERCEIVED STRENGTH OF THE COMPANY AND ITS PRODUCTS, THE ANTICIPATED REVENUE THAT MAY BE GENERATED, CONTINUED ACCEPTANCE BY CUSTOMERS OF MAC OS X, AND THE COSTS OF DEVELOPING SUCH APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES. IF THE COMPANYS MINORITY SHARE OF THE

GLOBAL PERSONAL COMPUTER MARKET CAUSES DEVELOPERS TO QUESTION THE COMPANYS PROSPECTS, DEVELOPERS COULD BE LESS INCLINED TO DEVELOP OR UPGRADE SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND MORE INCLINED TO DEVOTE THEIR RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING

AND UPGRADING SOFTWARE FOR THE LARGER WINDOWS MARKET. THE COMPANYS DEVELOPMENT OF ITS OWN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES MAY ALSO NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE DECISIONS OF THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS, SUCH AS MICROSOFT, ADOBE AND GOOGLE, TO DEVELOP,

MAINTAIN, AND UPGRADE SIMILAR OR COMPETITIVE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO IPHONE,

IPAD AND IPOD TOUCH, THE COMPANY RELIES ON THE CONTINUED AVAILABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF COMPELLING AND INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS. UNLIKE THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR MAC PRODUCTS, THE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR THE IPHONE, IPAD AND

IPOD TOUCH PLATFORMS ARE DISTRIBUTED THROUGH A SINGLE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL, THE APP STORE. THE ABSENCE OF MULTIPLE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, WHICH ARE AVAILABLE FOR COMPETING PLATFORMS, MAY LIMIT THE AVAILABILITY AND ACCEPTANCE OF THIRD-PARTY

APPLICATIONS BY THE COMPANYS CUSTOMERS, THEREBY CAUSING DEVELOPERS TO CURTAIL SIGNIFICANTLY, OR STOP, DEVELOPMENT FOR THE COMPANYS PLATFORMS. IN ADDITION, IPHONE, IPAD AND IPOD TOUCH ARE SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, AND, IF

THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS ARE UNABLE TO KEEP UP WITH THIS PACE OF CHANGE, THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS MIGHT NOT SUCCESSFULLY OPERATE AND MAY RESULT IN DISSATISFIED CUSTOMERS. FURTHER, IF THE COMPANY DEVELOPS ITS OWN SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES,

SUCH DEVELOPMENT MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT THE DECISIONS OF THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS TO DEVELOP, MAINTAIN,

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND UPGRADE SIMILAR OR COMPETITIVE APPLICATIONS FOR THE IPHONE, IPAD AND IPOD TOUCH PLATFORMS. AS WITH APPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANYS MAC PRODUCTS, THE AVAILABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT OF THESE

APPLICATIONS ALSO DEPEND ON DEVELOPERS PERCEPTIONS AND ANALYSIS OF THE RELATIVE BENEFITS OF DEVELOPING SOFTWARE FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS RATHER THAN ITS COMPETITORS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING DEVICES THAT USE COMPETING PLATFORMS. IF

DEVELOPERS FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON THESE COMPETING PLATFORMS, THE AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF APPLICATIONS FOR THE COMPANYS DEVICES MAY SUFFER.

THE COMPANYS FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE DEPENDS ON THE PERFORMANCE OF DISTRIBUTORS, CARRIERS AND OTHER RESELLERS.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH WHOLESALERS, RESELLERS, NATIONAL AND REGIONAL RETAILERS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS, AND CATALOGUERS, MANY OF WHOM DISTRIBUTE PRODUCTS FROM COMPETING MANUFACTURERS.

THE COMPANY ALSO SELLS MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND RESELLS THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS IN MOST OF ITS MAJOR MARKETS DIRECTLY TO CUSTOMERS, CERTAIN EDUCATION CUSTOMERS, CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS AND CERTAIN RESELLERS THROUGH ITS

ONLINE AND RETAIL STORES.

MANY RESELLERS OPERATE ON NARROW OPERATING MARGINS AND HAVE BEEN NEGATIVELY AFFECTED IN THE PAST BY

WEAK ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. SOME RESELLERS HAVE PERCEIVED THE EXPANSION OF THE COMPANYS DIRECT SALES AS CONFLICTING WITH THEIR BUSINESS INTERESTS AS DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. SUCH A PERCEPTION COULD DISCOURAGE

RESELLERS FROM INVESTING RESOURCES IN THE DISTRIBUTION AND SALE OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS OR LEAD THEM TO LIMIT OR CEASE DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE PRODUCTS. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED IF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THESE RESELLERS WEAKENS, IF RESELLERS STOPPED DISTRIBUTING THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, OR IF UNCERTAINTY REGARDING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS CAUSED RESELLERS TO REDUCE THEIR ORDERING AND MARKETING

OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED AND WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN PROGRAMS TO ENHANCE RESELLER SALES, INCLUDING STAFFING SELECTED RESELLERS STORES WITH COMPANY EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACTORS AND IMPROVING PRODUCT PLACEMENT

DISPLAYS. THESE PROGRAMS COULD REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT WHILE PROVIDING NO ASSURANCE OF RETURN OR INCREMENTAL REVENUE.

THE COMPANYS RETAIL BUSINESS HAS REQUIRED AND WILL CONTINUE TO REQUIRE A SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT AND COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES AND

IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

THE COMPANYS RETAIL STORES HAVE REQUIRED SUBSTANTIAL FIXED

INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INVENTORY AND PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS ENTERED INTO SUBSTANTIAL OPERATING LEASE COMMITMENTS FOR RETAIL SPACE, WITH TERMS RANGING FROM FIVE TO 20 YEARS, THE MAJORITY OF

WHICH ARE FOR TEN YEARS. CERTAIN STORES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED AND BUILT TO SERVE AS HIGH-PROFILE VENUES TO PROMOTE BRAND AWARENESS AND SERVE AS VEHICLES FOR CORPORATE SALES AND MARKETING ACTIVITIES. BECAUSE OF THEIR UNIQUE DESIGN ELEMENTS, LOCATIONS

AND SIZE, THESE STORES REQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY MORE INVESTMENT THAN THE COMPANYS MORE TYPICAL RETAIL STORES. DUE TO THE HIGH FIXED COST STRUCTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETAIL SEGMENT, A DECLINE IN SALES OR THE CLOSURE OR POOR PERFORMANCE OF

INDIVIDUAL OR MULTIPLE STORES COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT LEASE TERMINATION COSTS, WRITE-OFFS OF EQUIPMENT AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, AND SEVERANCE COSTS THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING

RESULTS.

MANY FACTORS UNIQUE TO RETAIL OPERATIONS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND THE COMPANYS CONTROL, POSE RISKS AND

UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON GENERAL

RETAIL ACTIVITY, AS WELL AS THE COMPANYS INABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH STORE CONSTRUCTION AND OPERATION, INABILITY TO SELL THIRD-PARTY PRODUCTS AT ADEQUATE MARGINS, FAILURE TO MANAGE RELATIONSHIPS WITH EXISTING RETAIL CHANNEL

PARTNERS, MORE CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT IN MANAGING RETAIL OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S., COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH UNANTICIPATED FLUCTUATIONS IN THE VALUE OF RETAIL INVENTORY, AND INABILITY TO OBTAIN AND RENEW LEASES IN QUALITY RETAIL LOCATIONS AT A

REASONABLE COST.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVESTMENT IN NEW

BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANYS ONGOING BUSINESS AND PRESENT RISKS NOT ORIGINALLY CONTEMPLATED.

THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED, AND IN THE FUTURE MAY INVEST, IN NEW BUSINESS STRATEGIES OR ACQUISITIONS. SUCH ENDEAVORS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING DISTRACTION OF MANAGEMENT FROM

CURRENT OPERATIONS, INSUFFICIENT REVENUE TO OFFSET LIABILITIES ASSUMED AND EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRATEGY, INADEQUATE RETURN OF CAPITAL, AND UNIDENTIFIED ISSUES NOT DISCOVERED IN THE COMPANYS DUE DILIGENCE. BECAUSE THESE NEW VENTURES

ARE INHERENTLY RISKY, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT SUCH STRATEGIES AND INITIATIVES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL AND WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES EXPERIENCE QUALITY PROBLEMS FROM TIME TO TIME THAT CAN RESULT IN DECREASED SALES AND

OPERATING MARGIN.

THE COMPANY SELLS HIGHLY COMPLEX HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT CAN CONTAIN DEFECTS IN

DESIGN AND MANUFACTURE. SOPHISTICATED OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE AND APPLICATIONS, SUCH AS THOSE SOLD BY THE COMPANY, OFTEN CONTAIN BUGS THAT CAN UNEXPECTEDLY INTERFERE WITH THE SOFTWARES INTENDED OPERATION. DEFECTS MAY ALSO OCCUR

IN COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THE COMPANY PURCHASES FROM THIRD PARTIES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO DETECT AND FIX ALL DEFECTS IN THE HARDWARE, SOFTWARE AND SERVICES IT SELLS. FAILURE TO DO SO COULD RESULT IN LOST REVENUE,

HARM TO REPUTATION, AND SIGNIFICANT WARRANTY AND OTHER EXPENSES, AND COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

IN THE U.S. THE COMPANY RELIES ON A SINGLE CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIER TO PROVIDE SERVICE FOR IPHONE.

IN THE U.S. THE COMPANY HAS CONTRACTED WITH A SINGLE CARRIER TO PROVIDE CELLULAR NETWORK SERVICES FOR IPHONE ON AN EXCLUSIVE BASIS. IF THIS EXCLUSIVE CARRIER CANNOT SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE WITH OTHER

CARRIERS IN THE U.S. MARKET ON ANY BASIS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE QUALITY AND COVERAGE OF WIRELESS VOICE AND DATA SERVICES, PERFORMANCE AND TIMELY BUILD-OUT OF ADVANCED WIRELESS NETWORKS, AND PRICING AND OTHER TERMS OR CONDITIONS OF

CUSTOMER CONTRACTS, OR IF THIS EXCLUSIVE CARRIER FAILS TO PROMOTE IPHONE AGGRESSIVELY OR FAVOR OTHER HANDSETS IN THEIR PROMOTION AND SALES ACTIVITIES OR SERVICE PLANS, SALES MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH LAWS, REGULATIONS AND INDUSTRY-IMPOSED STANDARDS RELATED TO MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND

MEDIA DEVICES.

LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO MOBILE COMMUNICATIONS AND MEDIA DEVICES IN THE MANY JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH

THE COMPANY OPERATES ARE EXTENSIVE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE. SUCH CHANGES, WHICH COULD INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO RESTRICTIONS ON PRODUCTION, MANUFACTURE, DISTRIBUTION, AND USE OF THE DEVICE, LOCKING THE DEVICE TO A CARRIERS NETWORK, OR

MANDATING THE USE OF THE DEVICE ON MORE THAN ONE CARRIERS NETWORK, COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

MOBILE COMMUNICATION AND MEDIA DEVICES, SUCH AS IPHONES AND 3G ENABLED IPADS, ARE SUBJECT TO CERTIFICATION AND REGULATION BY GOVERNMENTAL AND STANDARDIZATION BODIES, AS WELL AS BY CELLULAR NETWORK

CARRIERS FOR USE ON THEIR NETWORKS. THESE CERTIFICATION PROCESSES ARE EXTENSIVE AND TIME CONSUMING, AND COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL TESTING REQUIREMENTS, PRODUCT MODIFICATIONS OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT SHIPMENT DATES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS SUCCESS DEPENDS LARGELY ON THE

CONTINUED SERVICE AND AVAILABILITY OF KEY PERSONNEL.

MUCH OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE SUCCESS DEPENDS ON THE CONTINUED

AVAILABILITY AND SERVICE OF KEY PERSONNEL, INCLUDING ITS CEO, ITS EXECUTIVE TEAM AND HIGHLY SKILLED EMPLOYEES IN TECHNICAL, MARKETING AND STAFF POSITIONS. EXPERIENCED PERSONNEL IN THE TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY ARE IN HIGH DEMAND AND COMPETITION FOR THEIR

TALENTS IS INTENSE, ESPECIALLY IN THE SILICON VALLEY, WHERE MOST OF THE COMPANYS KEY PERSONNEL ARE LOCATED. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN KEY PERSONNEL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

POLITICAL EVENTS,

WAR, TERRORISM, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER CIRCUMSTANCES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY.

WAR, TERRORISM, GEOPOLITICAL UNCERTAINTIES, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS HAVE CAUSED AND COULD CAUSE DAMAGE OR DISRUPTION TO INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE AND THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, AND

THUS COULD HAVE A STRONG NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY, ITS SUPPLIERS, LOGISTICS PROVIDERS, MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO INTERRUPTION BY NATURAL DISASTERS,

FIRE, POWER SHORTAGES, TERRORIST ATTACKS, AND OTHER HOSTILE ACTS, LABOR DISPUTES, PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, AND OTHER EVENTS BEYOND ITS CONTROL. SUCH EVENTS COULD DECREASE DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, MAKE IT DIFFICULT OR IMPOSSIBLE FOR THE

COMPANY TO MAKE AND DELIVER PRODUCTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNERS, OR TO RECEIVE COMPONENTS FROM ITS SUPPLIERS, AND CREATE DELAYS AND INEFFICIENCIES IN THE COMPANYS SUPPLY CHAIN. SHOULD MAJOR PUBLIC HEALTH ISSUES, INCLUDING

PANDEMICS, ARISE, THE COMPANY COULD BE NEGATIVELY AFFECTED BY MORE STRINGENT EMPLOYEE TRAVEL RESTRICTIONS, ADDITIONAL LIMITATIONS IN FREIGHT SERVICES, GOVERNMENTAL ACTIONS LIMITING THE MOVEMENT OF PRODUCTS BETWEEN REGIONS, DELAYS IN PRODUCTION RAMPS

OF NEW PRODUCTS, AND DISRUPTIONS IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING VENDORS AND COMPONENT SUPPLIERS. THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, ITS CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

SYSTEMS, AND OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS, INCLUDING CERTAIN COMPONENT SUPPLIERS AND MANUFACTURING VENDORS, ARE IN LOCATIONS THAT COULD BE AFFECTED BY NATURAL DISASTERS. IN THE EVENT OF A NATURAL DISASTER, LOSSES AND SIGNIFICANT RECOVERY TIME

COULD BE REQUIRED TO RESUME OPERATIONS AND THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE COMPANY MAY BE SUBJECT TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES, NETWORK DISRUPTIONS AND BREACHES IN DATA SECURITY.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEM FAILURES, NETWORK DISRUPTIONS AND BREACHES OF DATA SECURITY CAUSED BY SUCH FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, EARTHQUAKES, FIRE, THEFT, FRAUD, MALICIOUS ATTACK OR OTHER

CAUSES COULD DISRUPT THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS BY CAUSING DELAYS OR CANCELLATION OF CUSTOMER, INCLUDING CHANNEL PARTNER, ORDERS, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING THE COMPANYS ONLINE, ITUNES, MOBILEME AND RETAIL OFFERINGS AND SERVICES, IMPEDING THE

MANUFACTURE OR SHIPMENT OF PRODUCTS, PROCESSING TRANSACTIONS AND REPORTING FINANCIAL RESULTS, RESULTING IN THE UNINTENTIONAL DISCLOSURE OF CUSTOMER OR COMPANY INFORMATION, OR DAMAGE TO THE COMPANYS REPUTATION. WHILE MANAGEMENT HAS TAKEN STEPS

TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS BY IMPLEMENTING SOPHISTICATED NETWORK SECURITY AND INTERNAL CONTROL MEASURES, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A SYSTEM FAILURE OR LOSS OR DATA SECURITY BREACH WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS QUARTERLY REVENUE AND OPERATING RESULTS TO FLUCTUATE FOR A

VARIETY OF REASONS.

THE COMPANYS PROFIT MARGINS VARY AMONG ITS PRODUCTS AND ITS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. THE

COMPANYS SOFTWARE, ACCESSORIES, AND SERVICE AND SUPPORT CONTRACTS GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER GROSS MARGINS THAN CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS OTHER PRODUCTS. GROSS MARGINS ON THE COMPANYS HARDWARE PRODUCTS VARY ACROSS PRODUCT LINES AND CAN

CHANGE OVER TIME AS A RESULT OF PRODUCT TRANSITIONS, PRICING AND CONFIGURATION CHANGES, AND COMPONENT, WARRANTY, AND OTHER COST FLUCTUATIONS. THE COMPANYS DIRECT SALES GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER ASSOCIATED GROSS MARGINS THAN ITS INDIRECT SALES

THROUGH ITS CHANNEL PARTNERS. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS GROSS MARGIN AND OPERATING MARGIN PERCENTAGES, AS WELL AS OVERALL PROFITABILITY, MAY BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF A SHIFT IN PRODUCT, GEOGRAPHIC OR CHANNEL MIX, NEW

PRODUCTS, COMPONENT COST INCREASES, STRENGTHENING U.S. DOLLAR, OR PRICE COMPETITION. THE COMPANY HAS TYPICALLY EXPERIENCED GREATER NET SALES IN THE FIRST AND FOURTH FISCAL QUARTERS COMPARED TO THE SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS DUE TO SEASONAL

DEMAND RELATED TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON AND THE BEGINNING OF THE SCHOOL YEAR, RESPECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY SELLS MORE PRODUCTS FROM TIME-TO-TIME DURING THE THIRD MONTH OF A QUARTER THAN IT DOES DURING EITHER OF THE FIRST TWO MONTHS.

DEVELOPMENTS LATE IN A QUARTER, SUCH AS LOWER-THAN-ANTICIPATED DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, ISSUES WITH NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, AN INTERNAL SYSTEMS FAILURE, OR FAILURE OF ONE OF THE COMPANYS KEY LOGISTICS, COMPONENTS SUPPLY, OR

MANUFACTURING PARTNERS, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS

STOCK PRICE CONTINUES TO BE VOLATILE.

THE COMPANYS STOCK HAS AT TIMES EXPERIENCED SUBSTANTIAL PRICE VOLATILITY DUE

TO A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO VARIATIONS BETWEEN ITS ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL RESULTS, ANNOUNCEMENTS BY THE COMPANY AND ITS COMPETITORS, AND UNCERTAINTY ABOUT CURRENT GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE STOCK MARKET AS A

WHOLE ALSO HAS EXPERIENCED EXTREME PRICE AND VOLUME FLUCTUATIONS THAT HAVE AFFECTED THE MARKET PRICE OF MANY TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN WAYS THAT MAY HAVE BEEN UNRELATED TO THESE COMPANIES OPERATING PERFORMANCE. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY BELIEVES

ITS STOCK PRICE REFLECTS HIGH FUTURE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY EXPECTATIONS. IF THE COMPANY FAILS TO MEET THESE EXPECTATIONS ITS STOCK PRICE MAY SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINE, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON INVESTOR CONFIDENCE AND EMPLOYEE

RETENTION.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY DERIVES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ITS REVENUE AND EARNINGS FROM ITS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. COMPLIANCE WITH U.S. AND FOREIGN

LAWS AND REGULATIONS THAT APPLY TO THE COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, INCLUDING WITHOUT LIMITATION IMPORT AND EXPORT REQUIREMENTS, ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS, TAX LAWS (INCLUDING U.S. TAXES ON FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES), FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND

CASH REPATRIATION RESTRICTIONS, DATA PRIVACY REQUIREMENTS, LABOR LAWS, AND ANTI-COMPETITION REGULATIONS, INCREASES THE COSTS OF DOING BUSINESS IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS, AND ANY SUCH COSTS, WHICH MAY RISE IN THE FUTURE AS A RESULT OF CHANGES IN THESE

LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR IN THEIR INTERPRETATION. FURTHERMORE, THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES DESIGNED TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, BUT THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES,

CONTRACTORS, OR AGENTS WILL NOT VIOLATE SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS OR THE COMPANYS POLICIES. ANY SUCH VIOLATIONS COULD INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS ALSO COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECTED BY OTHER RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH INTERNATIONAL ACTIVITIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ECONOMIC AND LABOR CONDITIONS, INCREASED DUTIES, TAXES AND OTHER COSTS, POLITICAL INSTABILITY, AND CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR VERSUS LOCAL CURRENCIES. MARGINS ON SALES OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND ON SALES OF PRODUCTS THAT INCLUDE COMPONENTS OBTAINED FROM FOREIGN SUPPLIERS, COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS AND BY INTERNATIONAL TRADE

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING DUTIES, TARIFFS AND ANTIDUMPING PENALTIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT AND COLLECTABILITY RISK ON ITS TRADE RECEIVABLES WITH CUSTOMERS IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE IT CAN

EFFECTIVELY LIMIT ITS CREDIT RISK AND AVOID LOSSES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY EXPOSURE TO MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES RELATE TO NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SALES IN EUROPE, JAPAN, AUSTRALIA, CANADA AND CERTAIN PARTS OF ASIA, AS WELL AS

NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED OPERATING EXPENSES INCURRED THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. WEAKENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES RELATIVE TO THE U.S. DOLLAR WILL ADVERSELY AFFECT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES AND

EARNINGS, AND GENERALLY WILL LEAD THE COMPANY TO RAISE INTERNATIONAL PRICING, POTENTIALLY REDUCING DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, DUE TO COMPETITION OR OTHER REASONS, THE COMPANY MAY DECIDE NOT TO RAISE LOCAL PRICES

TO THE FULL EXTENT OF THE DOLLARS STRENGTHENING, OR AT ALL, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS. CONVERSELY, A STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHILE

GENERALLY BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SALES AND EARNINGS, COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY TO REDUCE INTERNATIONAL PRICING AND INCUR LOSSES ON ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, THEREBY LIMITING THE BENEFIT.

ADDITIONALLY, STRENGTHENING OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY ALSO INCREASE THE COMPANYS COST OF PRODUCT COMPONENTS DENOMINATED IN THOSE CURRENCIES, THUS ADVERSELY AFFECTING GROSS MARGINS.

THE COMPANY HAS USED DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS, TO HEDGE CERTAIN EXPOSURES TO

FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE USE OF SUCH HEDGING ACTIVITIES MAY NOT OFFSET ANY OR MORE THAN A PORTION OF THE ADVERSE FINANCIAL EFFECTS OF UNFAVORABLE MOVEMENTS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES OVER THE LIMITED TIME THE HEDGES ARE IN

PLACE.

THE COMPANY IS

EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO.

ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS NOT

RECOGNIZED ANY SIGNIFICANT LOSSES TO DATE ON ITS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ANY SIGNIFICANT FUTURE DECLINES IN THEIR MARKET VALUES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

GIVEN THE GLOBAL NATURE OF ITS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY HAS INVESTMENTS BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY. CREDIT RATINGS AND PRICING OF THESE INVESTMENTS CAN BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY LIQUIDITY, CREDIT DETERIORATION OR LOSSES, FINANCIAL RESULTS,

OR OTHER FACTORS. AS A RESULT, THE VALUE OR LIQUIDITY OF THE COMPANYS CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES COULD DECLINE AND RESULT IN A MATERIAL IMPAIRMENT, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, VENDOR NON-TRADE

RECEIVABLES AND PREPAYMENTS RELATED TO LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS. THIS RISK IS HEIGHTENED DURING PERIODS WHEN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WORSEN.

THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS THROUGH THIRD-PARTY CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS, WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS. A SUBSTANTIAL MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING TRADE

RECEIVABLES ARE NOT COVERED BY COLLATERAL OR CREDIT INSURANCE. THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT AND COLLECTABILITY RISK ON ITS TRADE RECEIVABLES ARE INCREASED IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AND ITS ABILITY TO MITIGATE SUCH RISKS MAY BE

LIMITED. CELLULAR NETWORK CARRIERS ACCOUNTED FOR A SIGNIFICANT POTION OF THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2010. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS UNSECURED VENDOR NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES RESULTING FROM PURCHASES OF COMPONENTS BY

CONTRACT MANUFACTURERS AND OTHER VENDORS THAT MANUFACTURE SUB-ASSEMBLIES OR ASSEMBLE FINAL PRODUCTS FOR THE COMPANY. TWO VENDORS ACCOUNTED FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANYS NON-TRADE RECEIVABLES AS OF SEPTEMBER 25, 2010. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS MADE PREPAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM SUPPLY AGREEMENTS TO SECURE SUPPLY OF CERTAIN INVENTORY COMPONENTS. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS PROCEDURES TO MONITOR AND LIMIT EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK ON ITS TRADE AND VENDOR NON-TRADE

RECEIVABLES AS WELL AS LONG-TERM PREPAYMENTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE SUCH PROCEDURES WILL EFFECTIVELY LIMIT ITS CREDIT RISK AND AVOID LOSSES, WHICH COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE MATTERS RELATING TO THE COMPANYS PAST STOCK OPTION PRACTICES AND ITS RESTATEMENT OF CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS MAY RESULT IN ADDITIONAL LITIGATION.

THE COMPANYS INVESTIGATION INTO ITS PAST STOCK OPTION PRACTICES AND

ITS RESTATEMENT OF PRIOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 GAVE RISE TO LITIGATION AND GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS. AS DESCRIBED IN PART I, ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,

SEVERAL DERIVATIVE AND CLASS ACTION COMPLAINTS REGARDING STOCK OPTIONS WERE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS. THESE ACTIONS HAVE BEEN DISMISSED FOLLOWING A COMPREHENSIVE SETTLEMENT. TWO FORMER OFFICERS OF THE

COMPANY WERE ALSO NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN AN SEC ENFORCEMENT ACTION, WHICH HAS BEEN SETTLED.

NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT

ADDITIONAL ACTIONS WILL NOT BE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CURRENT AND FORMER OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS AS A RESULT OF PAST STOCK OPTION PRACTICES. IF SUCH ACTIONS ARE FILED AND RESULT IN ADVERSE FINDINGS, THE REMEDIES COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

UNFAVORABLE RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS COULD

MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS THAT HAVE ARISEN

OUT OF THE ORDINARY CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESS AND ARE NOT YET RESOLVED AND ADDITIONAL CLAIMS MAY ARISE IN THE FUTURE. RESULTS OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS CANNOT BE PREDICTED WITH CERTAINTY. REGARDLESS OF MERIT, LITIGATION MAY BE BOTH TIME-CONSUMING AND

DISRUPTIVE TO THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND CAUSE SIGNIFICANT EXPENSE AND DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENT ATTENTION. IN RECOGNITION OF THESE CONSIDERATIONS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO MATERIAL SETTLEMENTS. SHOULD THE COMPANY FAIL TO PREVAIL IN CERTAIN

MATTERS, OR SHOULD SEVERAL OF THESE MATTERS BE RESOLVED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE SAME REPORTING PERIOD, THE COMPANY MAY BE FACED WITH SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST IT THAT WOULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT A PORTION OF

ITS BUSINESS AND MIGHT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND THE PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF THOSE GOODS AND SERVICES, ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF LAWS AND REGULATIONS. THESE MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO OFFER CUSTOMERS THE ABILITY TO RETURN A PRODUCT AT THE END OF

ITS USEFUL LIFE AND PLACE RESPONSIBILITY FOR ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE DISPOSAL OR RECYCLING WITH THE COMPANY. SUCH LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAVE BEEN PASSED IN SEVERAL JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES, INCLUDING VARIOUS COUNTRIES WITHIN EUROPE

AND ASIA AND CERTAIN STATES AND PROVINCES WITHIN NORTH AMERICA. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECTS BASED ON THE NATURE OF ITS OPERATIONS AND THE FOCUS OF SUCH LAWS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE SUCH EXISTING LAWS OR

FUTURE LAWS WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

CHANGES IN

THE COMPANYS TAX RATES, THE ADOPTION OF NEW U.S. OR INTERNATIONAL TAX LEGISLATION OR EXPOSURE TO ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES COULD AFFECT ITS FUTURE RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO TAXES IN THE UNITED STATES AND NUMEROUS FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANYS FUTURE EFFECTIVE TAX RATES COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN THE MIX OF EARNINGS IN COUNTRIES WITH

DIFFERING STATUTORY TAX RATES, CHANGES IN THE VALUATION OF DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, OR CHANGES IN TAX LAWS OR THEIR INTERPRETATION. IN ADDITION, THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS HAVE ANNOUNCED PROPOSALS FOR NEW U.S. TAX

LEGISLATION THAT, IF ADOPTED, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS TAX RATE. ANY OF THESE CHANGES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON THE COMPANYS PROFITABILITY. THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE CONTINUAL EXAMINATION OF ITS INCOME

TAX RETURNS BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND OTHER TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY REGULARLY ASSESSES THE LIKELIHOOD OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES RESULTING FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS TO DETERMINE THE ADEQUACY OF ITS PROVISION FOR TAXES. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT THE OUTCOMES FROM THESE EXAMINATIONS WILL NOT MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AVAILABILITY AND COVERAGE OF INSURANCE.

FOR CERTAIN RISKS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT MAINTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE BECAUSE OF COST AND/OR AVAILABILITY. BECAUSE THE COMPANY RETAINS SOME PORTION OF ITS INSURABLE RISKS, AND IN SOME CASES

SELF-INSURES COMPLETELY, UNFORESEEN OR CATASTROPHIC LOSSES IN EXCESS OF INSURED LIMITS COULD MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.
