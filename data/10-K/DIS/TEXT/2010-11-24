COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY

THE COMPANYS MEDIA NETWORKS BUSINESSES

COMPETE FOR VIEWERS PRIMARILY WITH OTHER TELEVISION AND CABLE NETWORKS, INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATIONS AND OTHER MEDIA, SUCH AS DVDS, VIDEO GAMES AND THE INTERNET. WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME, OUR BROADCASTING OPERATIONS, CERTAIN

OF OUR CABLE NETWORKS AND OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS COMPETE WITH OTHER TELEVISION NETWORKS AND RADIO STATIONS, INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATIONS, MVSPS AND OTHER ADVERTISING MEDIA SUCH AS NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, BILLBOARDS, AND THE INTERNET.

OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS PRIMARILY COMPETE FOR VIEWERS IN INDIVIDUAL MARKET AREAS. A TELEVISION OR RADIO STATION IN ONE MARKET GENERALLY DOES NOT COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH STATIONS IN OTHER MARKETS.

THE GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF NETWORKS DISTRIBUTED BY MVSPS HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FOR ADVERTISING REVENUES FOR

BOTH OUR BROADCASTING AND CABLE NETWORKS. THE COMPANYS CABLE NETWORKS ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER CABLE NETWORKS FOR CARRIAGE BY MVSPS. THE COMPANYS CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH MVSPS ARE RENEWED OR

FEDERAL REGULATION

TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) UNDER FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934, AS

AMENDED. VIOLATION OF FCC REGULATIONS CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY FORFEITURES, LIMITED RENEWALS OF LICENSES AND, IN EGREGIOUS CASES, DENIAL OF LICENSE RENEWAL OR REVOCATION OF A LICENSE. FCC REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT

INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



LICENSING OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS.

EACH OF THE TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE OWN MUST BE LICENSED BY THE FCC. THESE LICENSES ARE

GRANTED FOR PERIODS OF UP TO EIGHT YEARS, AND WE MUST OBTAIN RENEWAL OF LICENSES AS THEY EXPIRE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OPERATING THE STATIONS. WE (OR THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN THE CASE OF A DIVESTITURE) MUST ALSO OBTAIN FCC APPROVAL WHENEVER WE SEEK TO

HAVE A LICENSE TRANSFERRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OR DIVESTITURE OF A STATION. THE FCC MAY DECLINE TO RENEW OR APPROVE THE TRANSFER OF A LICENSE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE GENERALLY RECEIVED SUCH RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN

THE PAST, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ALWAYS OBTAIN NECESSARY RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE FUTURE.



TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP LIMITS.

THE FCC IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN

A SPECIFIC MARKET, ON THE COMBINED NUMBER OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SINGLE MARKET AND ON THE AGGREGATE PERCENTAGE OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE THAT CAN BE REACHED BY TELEVISION STATIONS WE OWN. CURRENTLY.



FCC REGULATIONS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN A MARKET, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND NATURE OF THE MARKET. WE DO NOT

OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN ANY OF THE TEN MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN A TELEVISION STATION.



FEDERAL STATUTES PERMIT OUR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE AGGREGATE TO REACH A MAXIMUM OF 39% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE (FOR THIS PURPOSE, FCC REGULATIONS

ATTRIBUTE TO UHF TELEVISION STATIONS ONLY 50% OF THE TELEVISION HOUSEHOLDS IN THEIR MARKET). FOR PURPOSES OF THE FCCS RULES, OUR 10 STATIONS REACH APPROXIMATELY 23% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE.



FCC REGULATIONS IN SOME CASES IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL RADIO OR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN

RADIO STATIONS, BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS ARE MATERIAL TO OUR CURRENT OPERATING PLANS.



DUAL NETWORKS.

FCC RULES CURRENTLY PROHIBIT ANY OF THE FOUR MAJOR TELEVISION NETWORKS  ABC, CBS, FOX AND NBC  FROM BEING UNDER

COMMON OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.



REGULATION OF PROGRAMMING.

THE FCC REGULATES BROADCAST PROGRAMMING BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BANNING INDECENT PROGRAMMING, REGULATING

POLITICAL ADVERTISING AND IMPOSING COMMERCIAL TIME LIMITS DURING CHILDRENS PROGRAMMING. BROADCASTERS FACE A HEIGHTENED RISK OF BEING FOUND IN VIOLATION OF THE INDECENCY PROHIBITION BY THE FCC BECAUSE OF RECENT FCC DECISIONS, COUPLED WITH THE

SPONTANEITY OF LIVE PROGRAMMING. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE FCC INCREASED ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO INDECENCY, AND A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT INDECENCY CASES AGAINST VARIOUS

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BROADCASTERS REMAIN PENDING IN THE COURTS. MOREOVER, THE PENALTIES FOR BROADCASTING INDECENT PROGRAMMING ARE A MAXIMUM OF $325,000 PER VIOLATION.

FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND FCC RULES ALSO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL MATTER THAT MAY BE SHOWN ON BROADCAST OR CABLE CHANNELS DURING

PROGRAMMING DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN 12 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. IN ADDITION, BROADCAST CHANNELS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF THREE HOURS PER WEEK OF PROGRAMMING THAT HAS AS A SIGNIFICANT PURPOSE MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL

AND INFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN 16 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. FCC RULES ALSO GIVE TELEVISION STATION OWNERS THE RIGHT TO REJECT OR REFUSE NETWORK PROGRAMMING IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO SUBSTITUTE PROGRAMMING THAT THE LICENSEE REASONABLY

BELIEVES TO BE OF GREATER LOCAL OR NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.



CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS.

WITH RESPECT TO CABLE SYSTEMS OPERATING WITHIN A TELEVISION STATIONS

DESIGNATED MARKET AREA, FCC RULES REQUIRE THAT EVERY THREE YEARS EACH TELEVISION STATION ELECT EITHER MUST CARRY STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH CABLE OPERATORS GENERALLY MUST CARRY A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION IN THE STATIONS MARKET, OR

RETRANSMISSION CONSENT STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE CABLE OPERATOR MUST NEGOTIATE WITH THE TELEVISION STATION TO OBTAIN THE CONSENT OF THE TELEVISION STATION PRIOR TO CARRYING ITS SIGNAL. UNDER THE SATELLITE HOME VIEWER IMPROVEMENT ACT

AND ITS SUCCESSORS, INCLUDING MOST RECENTLY THE SATELLITE TELEVISION EXTENSION AND LOCALISM ACT (STELA), WHICH ALSO REQUIRES THE MUST CARRY OR RETRANSMISSION CONSENT ELECTION, SATELLITE CARRIERS ARE PERMITTED TO RETRANSMIT A

LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS SIGNAL INTO ITS LOCAL MARKET WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LOCAL TELEVISION STATION. UNDER MUST CARRY, IF A SATELLITE CARRIER ELECTS TO CARRY ONE LOCAL STATION IN A MARKET, THE SATELLITE CARRIER MUST CARRY THE SIGNALS OF

ALL LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS THAT ALSO REQUEST CARRIAGE.



DIGITAL TELEVISION.

PURSUANT TO FCC REGULATIONS, ALL OF THE COMPANYS STATIONS NOW OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY ON DIGITAL CHANNELS. EACH STATION

BROADCASTS THREE DIGITAL CHANNELS: THE MAIN CHANNEL, AFFILIATED WITH THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK; THE LIVE WELL NETWORK; AND WEATHER REPORTS POWERED BY ACCUWEATHER, ALONG WITH NEWS AND SPORTS HEADLINES.



CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF PROGRAMMING.

THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND FCC RULES REGULATE SOME ASPECTS OF NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING CABLE AND

SATELLITE RETRANSMISSION CONSENT, AND SOME CABLE AND SATELLITE COMPANIES HAVE SOUGHT REGULATION OF ADDITIONAL ASPECTS OF THE CARRIAGE OF PROGRAMMING ON CABLE AND SATELLITE SYSTEMS. LITIGATION HAS BEEN INSTITUTED AGAINST THE COMPANY, OTHER PROGRAM

PROVIDERS AND DISTRIBUTORS SEEKING AMONG OTHER THINGS TO ACHIEVE SIMILAR ENDS. NEW LEGISLATION, COURT ACTION OR REGULATION IN THIS AREA COULD, DEPENDING ON ITS SPECIFIC NATURE, HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS.

THE FOREGOING IS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND OTHER LEGISLATION AND

OF SPECIFIC FCC RULES AND POLICIES. REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE TO THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT, OTHER LEGISLATION, FCC RULES AND PUBLIC NOTICES AND RULINGS OF THE FCC FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FCCS REGULATORY

RISK FACTORS

FOR AN

ENTERPRISE AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS THE COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS AFFECTING SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPERATIONS IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF

THESE OPERATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

CHANGES IN U.S., GLOBAL, OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES.

A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND

FOR ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, THUS REDUCING OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS. THE MOST RECENT DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REDUCED SPENDING AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS, PURCHASE OF AND PRICES FOR ADVERTISING ON OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND OWNED

STATIONS, PERFORMANCE OF OUR HOME ENTERTAINMENT RELEASES, AND PURCHASES OF COMPANY-BRANDED CONSUMER PRODUCTS, AND SIMILAR IMPACTS CAN BE EXPECTED SHOULD SUCH CONDITIONS RECUR. A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO REDUCE ATTENDANCE AT OUR

PARKS AND RESORTS OR PRICES THAT MVSPS PAY FOR OUR CABLE PROGRAMMING. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CAN ALSO IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THOSE WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS TO SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN PRICE LEVELS GENERALLY, OR IN

PRICE LEVELS IN A PARTICULAR SECTOR SUCH AS THE ENERGY SECTOR, COULD RESULT IN A SHIFT IN CONSUMER DEMAND AWAY FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS WE OFFER, WHICH COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASE OUR

COSTS. CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY REDUCE INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCREASE OUR LABOR OR SUPPLY COSTS IN NON-UNITED STATES MARKETS, OR REDUCE THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR VALUE OF REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER

MARKETS.

CHANGES IN PUBLIC AND CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR

ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES

CREATE ENTERTAINMENT, TRAVEL OR CONSUMER PRODUCTS WHOSE SUCCESS DEPENDS SUBSTANTIALLY ON CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES THAT CHANGE IN OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO CONSISTENTLY CREATE AND

DISTRIBUTE FILMED ENTERTAINMENT, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ONLINE MATERIAL, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, HOTELS AND OTHER RESORT FACILITIES AND TRAVEL EXPERIENCES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE CHANGING PREFERENCES OF THE

BROAD CONSUMER MARKET. MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON ACCEPTANCE OF OUR OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS BY CONSUMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND THEIR SUCCESS THEREFORE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT AND ADAPT TO CHANGING

CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES OUTSIDE AS WELL AS INSIDE THE UNITED STATES. MOREOVER, WE MUST OFTEN INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN FILM PRODUCTION, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, OR HOTELS AND OTHER RESORT

FACILITIES BEFORE WE LEARN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PRODUCTS WILL EARN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. IF OUR

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, OUR REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING SALES (WHICH ARE BASED IN PART ON RATINGS FOR THE PROGRAMS IN WHICH ADVERTISEMENTS

AIR) OR SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING AND ONLINE SERVICES, FROM THEATRICAL FILM RECEIPTS OR HOME VIDEO OR ELECTRONIC GAME SALES, FROM THEME PARK ADMISSIONS, HOTEL ROOM CHARGES AND MERCHANDISE, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES, FROM

SALES OF LICENSED CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR FROM SALES OF OUR OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY DECLINE AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES.

CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND IN CONSUMER CONSUMPTION PATTERNS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS OR THE COST OF PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTS.

THE MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT AND INTERNET BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE, DEVELOP, ADOPT

AND EXPLOIT NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO DISTINGUISH OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGIES AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THE TIME AND MANNER IN WHICH CONSUMERS ACQUIRE AND VIEW SOME OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT

PRODUCTS AND THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO ADVERTISERS FOR REACHING THEIR DESIRED MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SUCCESS OF OUR OFFERINGS IN THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET DEPENDS IN PART ON CONSUMER PREFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO HOME ENTERTAINMENT FORMATS,

INCLUDING DVD PLAYERS AND PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDERS, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE HOME ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING WEB-BASED DELIVERY OF ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OFFER

CONSUMERS AN EXPANDING ARRAY OF ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS WHICH MAY INCLUDE OPTIONS WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED, OR OPTIONS WE HAVE DEVELOPED BUT ON WHICH WE REALIZE A SMALLER RETURN THAN ON TRADITIONAL OPTIONS AND THUS THE INCOME FROM OUR

ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS MAY DECLINE OR INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES IS HIGHLY

DEPENDENT ON THE EXISTENCE AND MAINTENANCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE CREATE.

THE VALUE TO US OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF OUR RIGHTS AS DEFINED BY APPLICABLE LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THOSE LAWS

ARE CONSTRUED. IF THOSE LAWS ARE DRAFTED OR INTERPRETED IN WAYS THAT LIMIT THE EXTENT OR DURATION OF OUR RIGHTS, OR IF EXISTING LAWS ARE CHANGED, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY DECREASE, OR THE COST OF OBTAINING

AND MAINTAINING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE.

THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF

PROTECTING THESE RIGHTS OR REDUCE OUR REVENUES. NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION, AND ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES, THE FALLING PRICES OF DEVICES INCORPORATING SUCH TECHNOLOGIES, AND INCREASED BROADBAND INTERNET SPEED

AND PENETRATION HAVE MADE THE UNAUTHORIZED DIGITAL COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR FILMS, TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND OTHER CREATIVE WORKS EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MORE CHALLENGING. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT

UNAUTHORIZED USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY GENERALLY IS A SIGNIFICANT AND RAPIDLY GROWING PHENOMENON. INADEQUATE LAWS OR WEAK ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN ONE COUNTRY CAN ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE, DESPITE THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THESE DEVELOPMENTS REQUIRE US TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

AGAINST UNLICENSED USE AND PRESENT THE RISK OF INCREASED LOSSES OF REVENUE AS A RESULT OF UNLICENSED DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION OF OUR CONTENT AND SALES OF UNAUTHORIZED DVDS, BLU-RAY DISCS AND OTHER PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE COMPANY AND RIGHTS ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY FROM OTHERS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

THE RISK OF CHALLENGES TO OUR RIGHTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BY THIRD PARTIES. SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGES TO OUR RIGHTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS FOR OBTAINING RIGHTS OR THE LOSS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN REVENUE FROM THE

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF CHALLENGED RIGHTS. THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF ANY CHALLENGES TO ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT IT CURRENTLY FORESEES HAVING A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS.

A VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR

INCREASE THE COST OF PROVIDING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PARTICULARLY OUR THEME

PARKS AND RESORTS, IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM. THE ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM, AS WELL AS DEMAND FOR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE UNITED STATES,

GLOBALLY OR IN SPECIFIC REGIONS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING: ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR NATURAL DISASTERS (SUCH AS EXCESSIVE HEAT OR RAIN, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES) ARISING FROM SHORT-TERM WEATHER PATTERNS

OR LONG-TERM CLIMATE CHANGE; HEALTH CONCERNS; INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL OR MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS; AND TERRORIST ATTACKS. THESE EVENTS AND OTHERS, SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN TRAVEL AND ENERGY COSTS AND COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACKS, INTRUSIONS OR OTHER

WIDESPREAD COMPUTING OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, MAY ALSO DAMAGE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THESE EVENTS. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE ROYALTIES FROM THE SALES OF OUR LICENSED GOODS

AND SERVICES BY THIRD PARTIES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESSES OPERATED UNDER BRANDS LICENSED FROM THE COMPANY, AND WE ARE THEREFORE DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESSES OF THOSE THIRD

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PARTIES FOR THAT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE. A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS COULD INFLUENCE THE SUCCESS OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES AND IF NEGATIVE FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF OUR

LICENSEES, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE OBTAIN INSURANCE AGAINST THE RISK OF LOSSES RELATING TO SOME OF THESE EVENTS, GENERALLY INCLUDING PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO OUR PROPERTY AND RESULTING BUSINESS

INTERRUPTION, CERTAIN INJURIES OCCURRING ON OUR PROPERTY AND LIABILITY FOR ALLEGED BREACH OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WHEN INSURANCE IS OBTAINED IT IS SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES, EXCLUSIONS AND CAPS. THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF COVERAGE WE OBTAIN VARY FROM

TIME TO TIME DEPENDING ON OUR VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SPECIFIC TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS IN RELATION TO THE COST OF OBTAINING COVERAGE FOR SUCH TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS.

CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS OR OTHERWISE AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OCCUR WE MAY NEED TO ADJUST OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES TO MEET THESE CHANGES OR WE MAY OTHERWISE FIND

IT NECESSARY TO RESTRUCTURE OUR OPERATIONS OR PARTICULAR BUSINESSES OR ASSETS. IN ADDITION, EXTERNAL EVENTS INCLUDING ACCEPTANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL OFFERINGS AND CHANGES IN MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS. WHEN THESE

CHANGES OR EVENTS OCCUR, WE MAY INCUR COSTS TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND MAY NEED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF ASSETS. WE MAY ALSO NEED TO INVEST IN NEW BUSINESSES THAT HAVE SHORT-TERM RETURNS THAT ARE NEGATIVE OR LOW AND WHOSE ULTIMATE

BUSINESS PROSPECTS ARE UNCERTAIN. IN ANY OF THESE EVENTS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE, WE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS OR RETURNS ON NEW INVESTMENTS MAY BE LOWER THAN PRIOR TO THE CHANGE IN STRATEGY OR

RESTRUCTURING.

TURMOIL IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND IMPEDE ACCESS TO OR INCREASE THE COST OF

FINANCING OUR OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS.

U.S. AND GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION

BEGINNING IN LATE 2008, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY BUSINESSES TO OBTAIN FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. IN ADDITION, EQUITY MARKETS EXPERIENCED RAPID AND WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN VALUE. THESE CONDITIONS TENDED TO INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING AND IF

THEY RECUR, OUR COST OF BORROWING COULD INCREASE AND IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING

AGENCIES WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. A DECREASE IN THESE RATINGS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE

DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING. THE DISRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS ALSO IMPACTED SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. A SIMILAR DECLINE IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD AFFECT OUR

ABILITY TO SECURE CREDIT-WORTHY COUNTERPARTIES FOR OUR INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING PROGRAMS AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SETTLE EXISTING CONTRACTS.

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES FROM ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER AND FROM OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATIONAL

ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO MUST COMPETE TO OBTAIN HUMAN RESOURCES, PROGRAMMING AND OTHER RESOURCES WE REQUIRE IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS, STATIONS AND ONLINE OFFERINGS COMPETE FOR VIEWERS WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES AS WELL AS WITH

HOME VIDEO PRODUCTS AND INTERNET USAGE.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND STATIONS COMPETE FOR THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES, AND THE

INTERNET, AS WELL AS WITH NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES AND BILLBOARDS.



OUR CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR CARRIAGE OF THEIR PROGRAMMING WITH OTHER PROGRAMMING PROVIDERS.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CREATIVE TALENT AND SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING WITH OTHER BROADCAST AND CABLE

NETWORKS.



OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS COMPETE FOR GUESTS WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATION ACTIVITIES.



OUR STUDIO OPERATIONS COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT.



OUR STUDIO OPERATIONS, BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND PUBLISHING BUSINESSES COMPETE TO OBTAIN CREATIVE AND PERFORMING TALENT, STORY PROPERTIES,

ADVERTISER SUPPORT, BROADCAST RIGHTS AND MARKET SHARE.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS



OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT COMPETES IN THE CHARACTER MERCHANDISING AND OTHER LICENSING, PUBLISHING, AND RETAIL ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER LICENSORS,

PUBLISHERS AND RETAILERS OF CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES.



OUR INTERACTIVE GAME OPERATIONS COMPETE WITH OTHER PUBLISHERS OF CONSOLE, ONLINE AND MOBILE GAMES AND OTHER TYPES OF HOME ENTERTAINMENT.

COMPETITION IN EACH OF THESE AREAS MAY DIVERT CONSUMERS FROM OUR CREATIVE OR OTHER PRODUCTS, OR TO OTHER

PRODUCTS OR OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR MARKETING COSTS. COMPETITION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF RESOURCES CAN INCREASE THE COST OF PRODUCING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

SUSTAINED INCREASES IN COSTS OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND OTHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

WITH APPROXIMATELY 149,000 EMPLOYEES, OUR PROFITABILITY IS SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED BY COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS AND

CURRENT AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. WE MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THESE COSTS AS A RESULT OF MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING INCREASES IN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN

INVESTMENT RETURNS AND DISCOUNT RATES USED TO CALCULATE PENSION EXPENSE AND RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE VOLATILE AND MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS IN SOME YEARS. THESE MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS AS WELL AS THE DECLINE IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF PENSION PLAN ASSETS MAY PUT UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING PENSION AND MEDICAL BENEFITS AND MAY INCREASE FUTURE FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE

THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE COULD REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR

RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF LONG-TERM PROGRAMMING OR CARRIAGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT RENEWED ON SUFFICIENTLY FAVORABLE TERMS.

WE ENTER INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR BOTH THE ACQUISITION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS FOR SPORTING EVENTS AND

OTHER PROGRAMS, AND CONTRACTS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PROGRAMMING TO MVSPS. AS THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRE, WE MUST RENEW OR RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RENEW THEM ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY LOSE PROGRAMMING RIGHTS OR

DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS. EVEN IF THESE CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED, THE COST OF OBTAINING PROGRAMMING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE (OR INCREASE AT FASTER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE) OR THE REVENUE FROM DISTRIBUTION OF PROGRAMS MAY BE REDUCED (OR INCREASE AT

SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE). WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, THE IMPACT OF THESE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS ON OUR RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT REVENUES FROM PROGRAMMING BASED ON THESE RIGHTS WILL EXCEED THE COST OF THE RIGHTS PLUS THE

OTHER COSTS OF PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAMMING.

CHANGES IN REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES MAY IMPAIR THE

PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BROADCAST NETWORKS AND TELEVISION STATIONS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED, AND EACH OF OUR

OTHER BUSINESSES IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF UNITED STATES AND OVERSEAS REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATIONS INCLUDE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OPERATION OF LAWS IN THOSE

JURISDICTIONS.

OUR OPERATIONS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS ARE IN MANY CASES SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN

WHICH THEY OPERATE RATHER THAN UNITED STATES LAW. LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS DIFFER IN SIGNIFICANT RESPECTS FROM THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THESE DIFFERENCES CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REACT TO CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND OUR RIGHTS OR ABILITY

TO ENFORCE RIGHTS DIFFERENTLY THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED UNDER UNITED STATES LAW. MOREOVER, ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS IN SOME OVERSEAS JURISDICTIONS CAN BE INCONSISTENT AND UNPREDICTABLE, WHICH CAN AFFECT BOTH OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS AND TO

UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE BENEFICIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE AND OUR EXPENSES IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS MAY DIFFER FROM WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED IF UNITED STATES LAW GOVERNED THESE

OPERATIONS.

LABOR DISPUTES MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN VARIOUS OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF

OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS AS WELL AS WRITERS, DIRECTORS, ACTORS, PRODUCTION PERSONNEL AND OTHERS EMPLOYED IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS AND STUDIO OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE EMPLOYEES OF LICENSEES WHO MANUFACTURE AND RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER

PRODUCTS MAY BE COVERED BY LABOR AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS. IN GENERAL, A LABOR DISPUTE INVOLVING OUR EMPLOYEES OR THE EMPLOYEES OF OUR LICENSEES OR RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUES,

AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS.

PROVISIONS IN OUR CORPORATE DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE STATE LAW COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A

CHANGE OF CONTROL, EVEN IF THAT CHANGE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO SHAREHOLDERS.

OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

CONTAINS A PROVISION REGULATING THE ABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BRING MATTERS FOR ACTION BEFORE ANNUAL AND SPECIAL MEETINGS AND AUTHORIZES OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE AND SET THE TERMS OF PREFERRED STOCK. THE REGULATIONS ON SHAREHOLDER ACTION

COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ANY PERSON SEEKING TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF ACTIONS THAT WOULD SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD EFFECTIVELY DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF ANY PERSON

SEEKING CONTROL OR OTHERWISE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN CONTROL. IN ADDITION, PROVISIONS IN OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION REQUIRE SUPERMAJORITY SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF SOME ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, EITHER OF WHICH COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE OF CONTROL IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE SEASONALITY OF CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES COULD EXACERBATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES IS NORMALLY SUBJECT TO SEASONAL VARIATIONS, AS FOLLOWS.



REVENUES IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. IN GENERAL, ADVERTISING REVENUES

ARE SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS ARE MET,

AND THESE COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION DURING THIS PERIOD.



REVENUES IN OUR PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY RESULTING FROM THE SEASONAL NATURE OF

VACATION TRAVEL AND LOCAL ENTERTAINMENT EXCURSIONS. PEAK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY GENERALLY OCCUR DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN SCHOOL VACATIONS OCCUR AND DURING EARLY-WINTER AND SPRING-HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT, AND

TELEVISION MARKETS. RELEASE DATES ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF THEATRICAL

RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS.



REVENUES IN OUR INTERACTIVE MEDIA SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF VIDEO GAME RELEASES WHICH ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING THEATRICAL RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS, COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF HOLIDAY PERIODS. REVENUES FROM CERTAIN OF OUR INTERNET AND MOBILE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR SEASONAL TRENDS.

ACCORDINGLY, IF A SHORT TERM NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OCCURS DURING A TIME OF HIGH SEASONAL DEMAND (SUCH AS HURRICANE DAMAGE TO

OUR PARKS DURING THE SUMMER TRAVEL SEASON), THE EFFECT COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF THAT BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANYS ACQUISITION OF MARVEL IS EXPECTED TO CAUSE SHORT TERM DILUTION IN EARNINGS PER SHARE

AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANTICIPATED IMPROVEMENTS IN EARNINGS PER SHARE WILL BE REALIZED.

ON DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT, INC. IN A MERGER TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 59 MILLION SHARES AND PAID APPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION IN CASH. WE EXPECT THAT THE MERGER WILL INITIALLY RESULT IN LOWER

EARNINGS PER SHARE THAN WE WOULD HAVE EARNED IN THE ABSENCE OF THE MERGER. WE EXPECT THAT OVER TIME THE MERGER WILL YIELD BENEFITS TO THE COMBINED COMPANY SUCH THAT THE MERGER WILL ULTIMATELY BE ACCRETIVE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THAT THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS PER SHARE EXPECTED IN THE LONG TERM WILL BE ACHIEVED. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE INCREASES IN EARNINGS PER SHARE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL, AMONG OTHER THINGS, NEED TO EFFECTIVELY

CONTINUE THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS OF MARVEL AFTER THE MERGER, DEVELOP SUCCESSFUL NEW CONTENT (INCLUDING FUTURE FEATURE FILMS AND TELEVISION SERIES OR SEQUELS TO MARVEL PRODUCTIONS) BASED ON MARVEL CHARACTERS AND SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE MARVEL

PRODUCTS INTO THE COMBINED COMPANYS VARIOUS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

CELADOR INTERNATIONAL LTD. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY.

ON MAY 19, 2004, AN AFFILIATE OF THE CREATOR AND LICENSOR OF THE

TELEVISION PROGRAM,

WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE,

FILED AN ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING AMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANIES, INC. AND BUENA VISTA TELEVISION, LLC, ALLEGING IT WAS DAMAGED BY

DEFENDANTS IMPROPERLY ENGAGING IN CERTAIN INTRA-COMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND CHARGING MERCHANDISE DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES, RESULTING IN AN UNDERPAYMENT TO THE PLAINTIFF. ON JULY 7, 2010, THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT

AGAINST CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY, AWARDING PLAINTIFF DAMAGES OF $269.4 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS STIPULATED WITH THE PLAINTIFF TO AN AWARD OF PREJUDGMENT INTEREST OF $50 MILLION, WHICH AMOUNT WILL BE REDUCED PRO RATA SHOULD THE

TRIAL COURT OR COURT OF APPEALS REDUCE THE DAMAGES AMOUNT. IF A NEW TRIAL IS ORDERED THE STIPULATION WILL HAVE NO EFFECT. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS LAWSUIT, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE JURYS VERDICT IS IN ERROR

AND HAS MOVED ALTERNATIVELY FOR A NEW TRIAL OR FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW, AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY PURSUE ITS POSITION ON APPEAL IF THOSE MOTIONS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE A PROBABLE LOSS UNDER THE

APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARD RELATING TO PROBABILITY OF LOSS FOR RECORDING A RESERVE WITH RESPECT TO THIS LITIGATION AND THEREFORE HAS NOT RECORDED A RESERVE.

THE COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES, CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR CODEFENDANT IN VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS INVOLVING COPYRIGHT, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER

CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE COMPANY TO SUFFER ANY MATERIAL LIABILITY BY REASON OF THESE ACTIONS.

THE EXECUTIVE

INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ROUNDING, THESE ITEMS COLLECTIVELY RESULTED IN A NET ADVERSE IMPACT OF $0.06 PER DILUTED SHARE. THE CURRENT YEAR RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE ONE FEWER WEEK OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009 DUE TO OUR FISCAL PERIOD END.

THE INCREASE IN EPS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR REFLECTED HIGHER OPERATING RESULTS DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES FROM MVSPS (AFFILIATE

FEES), INCREASED ADVERTISING REVENUES AT OUR CABLE AND BROADCAST BUSINESSES, THE STRONG WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE OF

TOY STORY 3, ALICE IN WONDERLAND

AND

IRON MAN 2

, AND LOWER DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING COSTS AT OUR HOME

ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PROGRAMMING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND PRODUCTION COSTS AT OUR CABLE BUSINESS AND HIGHER COSTS AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS OPERATIONS.

BAD DEBT CHARGE FOR A RECEIVABLE FROM LEHMAN BROTHERS ($0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE) AND AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ($0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE). THESE ITEMS COLLECTIVELY HAD NO NET IMPACT ON EPS. FISCAL 2009 RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE THE BENEFIT FROM ONE ADDITIONAL

WEEK OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008 DUE TO THE TIMING OF OUR FISCAL PERIOD END.

THE DECREASE IN EPS FOR FISCAL 2009

REFLECTED LOWER OPERATING RESULTS AND THE ITEMS DISCUSSED ABOVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING RESULTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER BROADCAST AND CABLE ADVERTISING REVENUES, A DECLINE

IN WORLDWIDE SALES OF DVD UNITS, DECREASED GUEST SPENDING AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS, HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS AND PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION AT OUR CABLE AND BROADCAST BUSINESSES, LOWER PERFORMANCE OF OUR MOVIES IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL AND

TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION AND LOWER EARNED REVENUE AT OUR LICENSING BUSINESS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES ON AFFILIATE FEES, COST MITIGATION ACTIVITIES AT PARKS AND RESORTS AND HIGHER INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC

SALES OF PROGRAMS AT BROADCASTING.

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND OTHER EMPLOYEE COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF A BAD DEBT CHARGE IN CONNECTION WITH A BANKRUPTCY OF A SYNDICATION CUSTOMER IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND ALSO A DECREASE DUE

WHICH INCLUDED BUNDLED ACCESSORIES, IN THE PRIOR YEAR TO LOWER COST CATALOG TITLES IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE OF $24 MILLION.

THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS REFLECTED HIGHER MARKETING COSTS DRIVEN BY

TOY STORY 3

AND

SPLIT SECOND.

SEGMENT OPERATING LOSS

THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES

AND LOWER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPENSE RELATED TO THE EARLY REDEMPTION OF A FILM FINANCING BORROWING.

THE DECREASE IN INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME FOR THE YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A GAIN ON THE SALE OF AN INVESTMENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR,

LOWER EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES AND LOWER AVERAGE CASH BALANCES.

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED 1.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 36.2% IN 2009 TO 34.9% IN 2010. THE LOWER EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR

THE YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO PRIOR-YEAR INCOME TAX MATTERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $72 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION ENACTED IN MARCH 2010.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS FOR THE YEAR INCREASED $48 MILLION TO $350 MILLION DRIVEN BY IMPROVED OPERATING RESULTS AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND AND ESPN. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IS DETERMINED BASED ON INCOME AFTER ROYALTIES, FINANCING COSTS AND INCOME TAXES.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN COSTS AFFECT RESULTS IN ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS, WITH

APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THESE COSTS BEING BORNE BY THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSES OF $482 MILLION, $214 MILLION, AND $255 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2010, 2009, AND

2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2010 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND ASSET RETURNS THAT WERE BELOW THE ASSUMED RETURN. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS

MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED FROM A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING

DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

WE EXPECT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL COSTS TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $94 MILLION TO $576 MILLION IN FISCAL 2011 DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS. THE DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE ALSO RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN

THE UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF OUR PLANS AND AN INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE WHICH IS $3.0 BILLION ($1.9 BILLION AFTER TAX) AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2010. IF OUR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE DOES NOT IMPROVE RELATIVE TO OUR

LONG-TERM ASSUMPTION AND/OR DISCOUNT RATES DO NOT INCREASE, WE EXPECT THAT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS WILL CONTINUE AT LEVELS COMPARABLE TO FISCAL 2011 FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS A RESULT OF AMORTIZING THESE UNRECOGNIZED EXPENSES. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF THE IMPACTS OF OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. DURING FISCAL 2010, THE COMPANY MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS

TOTALING $433 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS IN FISCAL 2011 OF APPROXIMATELY $450 MILLION, WHICH IS

EXPECTED TO INCLUDE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. FINAL MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR FISCAL 2011 WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON OUR JANUARY 1, 2011 FUNDING ACTUARIAL VALUATION WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE IN LATE

FISCAL 2011. SEE ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS FOR THE IMPACT OF FACTORS AFFECTING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS.

ADDITIONAL WEEK OF OPERATIONS.

LOWER ADVERTISING REVENUES WERE DUE TO DECREASES AT BROADCASTING OF $421 MILLION FROM $4,298

MILLION TO $3,877 MILLION AND CABLE NETWORKS OF $149 MILLION FROM $2,838 MILLION TO $2,689 MILLION. THE DECREASE AT BROADCASTING REFLECTED A DECREASE OF 6% DUE TO LOWER NETWORK RATINGS AND A DECREASE OF 5% IN LOCAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE BENEFIT OF ONE ADDITIONAL WEEK OF OPERATIONS. THE DECREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS REFLECTED A DECREASE OF 8% DUE TO FEWER UNITS SOLD, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF 4% DUE TO HIGHER RATES.

OTHER REVENUES INCREASED $259 MILLION AT BROADCASTING AND $49 MILLION AT CABLE NETWORKS. THE INCREASE AT BROADCASTING REFLECTED HIGHER

INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC SALES OF PROGRAMS DRIVEN BY

GREYS ANATOMY, PRIVATE PRACTICE,

AND

CRIMINAL MINDS.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE AN INCREASE IN PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS OF $455 MILLION FROM $7,768 MILLION TO $8,223 MILLION. AT CABLE NETWORKS AN INCREASE IN PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION SPENDING OF

$200 MILLION WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER SPORTS RIGHTS COSTS DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES FOR KEY CONTRACTS AND COSTS OF NEW AND RENEWED CONTRACTS FOR COLLEGE AND INTERNATIONAL SPORTS PROGRAMMING. AT BROADCASTING THE INCREASE IN PROGRAMMING AND

PRODUCTION SPENDING OF $255 MILLION WAS DRIVEN BY MORE HOURS OF ORIGINAL SCRIPTED PRIMETIME PROGRAMMING AND HIGHER PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION RELATED TO PROGRAM SALES.

THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES INCLUDED LOWER MARKETING AND SALES EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A BAD DEBT CHARGE IN CONNECTION WITH A BANKRUPTCY OF A

SYNDICATION CUSTOMER OF APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION.

AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATES, AND DECREASED MERCHANDISE SPENDING. IN ADDITION, LOWER GAINS ON SECURITIZED SALES OF VACATION OWNERSHIP INTERESTS (SEE NOTE 16 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN REVENUE

THE DECREASE IN OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

REFLECTED THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION OF 7% AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO AT DISNEYLAND PARIS.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT ARE PRINCIPALLY FOR THEME PARK AND RESORT EXPANSION,

NEW RIDES AND ATTRACTIONS, CRUISE SHIPS, RECURRING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. THE INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS IN FISCAL 2010 REFLECTED HIGHER CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS PAYMENTS ON TWO NEW

CRUISE SHIPS, THE EXPANSION AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND AND DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE AND THE CONSTRUCTION OF A DISNEY VACATION CLUB RESORT IN HAWAII. THE INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS IN FISCAL 2009 REFLECTED SPENDING

ON THE DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE EXPANSION AND CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS PAYMENTS ON TWO NEW CRUISE SHIPS.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

AT MEDIA NETWORKS PRIMARILY REFLECT INVESTMENTS IN FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT FOR EXPANDING AND UPGRADING BROADCAST CENTERS, PRODUCTION FACILITIES, AND TELEVISION STATION FACILITIES.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT CORPORATE PRIMARILY REFLECT INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND OTHER EQUIPMENT AND CORPORATE FACILITIES.

THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2010 WAS DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS IN EQUIPMENT AND CORPORATE FACILITIES.

OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES

DURING FISCAL 2010, ACQUISITIONS TOTALED $2.5 BILLION AND INCLUDED THE ACQUISITIONS OF MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND

PLAYDOM, INC. (SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET PROCEEDS TOTALING $170 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN TWO TELEVISION SERVICES IN EUROPE AND THE SALE OF THE RIGHTS AND ASSETS RELATED TO THE

POWER RANGERS PROPERTY.

DURING FISCAL 2009, ACQUISITIONS TOTALED $176 MILLION AND INCLUDED THE PURCHASE OF ADDITIONAL

INTERESTS IN UTV (SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), OFFSET BY PROCEEDS TOTALING $185 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN TWO PAY TELEVISION SERVICES IN LATIN AMERICA.

DURING FISCAL 2008, ACQUISITIONS TOTALED $660 MILLION WHICH INCLUDED AN ADDITIONAL INTEREST IN UTV.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2010 DECREASED BY $398 MILLION TO $2.8 BILLION COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009 AND CONSISTED OF REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK, REPAYMENTS OF BORROWINGS, THE PAYMENT OF

DIVIDENDS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS. THE DECREASE FROM FISCAL 2009 WAS DUE TO LOWER REPAYMENTS OF BORROWINGS AND INCREASED PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SHARE REPURCHASES. CASH USED IN

FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2009 DECREASED BY $1.1 BILLION TO $3.1 BILLION COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008 AND CONSISTED OF REPAYMENTS OF BORROWINGS, THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS, THE LIQUIDATION OF A NONCONTROLLING INTEREST AND REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK.

THE DECREASE FROM FISCAL 2008 WAS DUE TO LOWER SHARE REPURCHASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER REPAYMENTS OF BORROWINGS, THE LIQUIDATION OF THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST AND DECREASED PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES.

THESE BANK FACILITIES ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS AT LIBOR-BASED RATES PLUS A SPREAD, WHICH DEPENDS ON THE

COMPANYS PUBLIC DEBT RATING AND CAN RANGE FROM 0.18% TO 4.5%. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO ISSUE UP TO $800 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE FACILITY EXPIRING IN FEBRUARY 2011, WHICH IF UTILIZED, REDUCES AVAILABLE BORROWING UNDER

THIS FACILITY. AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2010, $225 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT HAD BEEN ISSUED UNDER THIS FACILITY.

THE COMPANY

MAY USE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS UP TO THE AMOUNT OF ITS UNUSED BANK FACILITIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH TERM DEBT ISSUANCE AND OPERATING CASH FLOW, TO RETIRE OR REFINANCE OTHER BORROWINGS BEFORE OR AS THEY COME DUE.

THE COMPANY PAID A $653 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.35 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010 RELATED TO FISCAL 2009. THE COMPANY

PAID A $648 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.35 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009 RELATED TO FISCAL 2008; AND PAID A $664 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.35 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008 RELATED TO FISCAL 2007. AS OF THE FILING DATE

OF THIS REPORT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD NOT YET DECLARED A DIVIDEND RELATED TO FISCAL 2010.

DURING FISCAL 2010, THE

COMPANY REPURCHASED 80 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $2.7 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 5 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $138 MILLION. DURING FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED

139 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $4.5 BILLION. AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD REMAINING AUTHORIZATION IN PLACE TO REPURCHASE 99 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH BALANCES, OTHER LIQUID ASSETS, OPERATING

CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING BUSINESSES AND

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAN BE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL. SEE ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS. IN ADDITION TO MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE COMPANYS BORROWING COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY

SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CERTAIN CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. AS OF

OCTOBER 2, 2010, MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A2 AND P-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK; STANDARD & POORS LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A

AND A-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK; AND FITCHS LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A AND F-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK. THE COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT, RELATING TO

INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE COMPANY MET ON OCTOBER 2, 2010, BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. THE COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES ALSO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE CERTAIN ENTITIES, SUCH AS EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND, FROM ANY REPRESENTATIONS,

COVENANTS OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

EURO DISNEY HAS ANNUAL COVENANTS UNDER ITS DEBT AGREEMENTS THAT LIMIT ITS INVESTMENT AND

FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND REQUIRE IT TO MEET CERTAIN FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COVENANTS. SUBJECT TO FINAL THIRD-PARTY REVIEW AS PROVIDED IN ITS DEBT AGREEMENTS, EURO DISNEY WAS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS WHICH ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OTHER ITEMS,

SUCH AS CERTAIN PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND OTHER EXECUTORY CONTRACTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT ARE REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN THE FOOTNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPANY IS

CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO ACQUIRE BROADCAST PROGRAMMING AND MAKE CERTAIN MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS FOR THE USE OF PROPERTY UNDER OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS AT OCTOBER 2, 2010 AND THE FUTURE PERIODS IN WHICH SUCH OBLIGATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE

SETTLED IN CASH. IN ADDITION, THE TABLE REFLECTS THE TIMING OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS. ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE PROVIDED IN THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS

COMPANYS CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL GUARANTEES.

LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS

AS DISCLOSED IN NOTES 10 AND 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR CERTAIN LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF

MANAGEMENT. FOR A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND COSTS

WE EXPENSE FILM AND TELEVISION

PRODUCTION, PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS REVENUES TO THE ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FOR EACH PRODUCTION. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF

ULTIMATE REVENUES DECREASES, AMORTIZATION OF FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED. CONVERSELY, IF ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES INCREASE, FILM AND TELEVISION COST AMORTIZATION MAY BE SLOWED. FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE

REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION SERIES, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF

STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER.

WITH RESPECT TO FILMS INTENDED FOR

THEATRICAL RELEASE, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES (AND THEREFORE AFFECTING FUTURE FILM COST AMORTIZATION AND/OR IMPAIRMENT) IS DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. REVENUES DERIVED FROM OTHER MARKETS SUBSEQUENT TO

THE DOMESTIC THEATRICAL RELEASE (E.G., THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT OR INTERNATIONAL THEATRICAL MARKETS) HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE VARIES PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE PUBLIC

INTEREST AND DEMAND FOR A PARTICULAR FILM, THE POPULARITY OF COMPETING FILMS AT THE TIME OF RELEASE AND THE LEVEL OF MARKETING EFFORT. UPON A FILMS RELEASE AND DETERMINATION OF DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF

REVENUES FROM SUCCEEDING WINDOWS AND MARKETS ARE REVISED BASED ON HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND AN ANALYSIS OF CURRENT MARKET TRENDS. THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR RELEASED FILMS IS THE EXTENT OF HOME

ENTERTAINMENT SALES ACHIEVED. HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES VARY BASED ON THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF COMPETING HOME VIDEO PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE MANNER IN WHICH RETAILERS MARKET AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO TELEVISION SERIES OR OTHER TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS INTENDED FOR BROADCAST, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING ESTIMATES

OF ULTIMATE REVENUES IS THE PROGRAMS RATING AND THE STRENGTH OF THE ADVERTISING MARKET. PROGRAM RATINGS, WHICH ARE AN INDICATION OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, DIRECTLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE ADVERTISING REVENUES DURING THE

AIRING OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, TELEVISION SERIES WITH GREATER MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUES THROUGH THE EVENTUAL SALE OF THE PROGRAM RIGHTS IN THE SYNDICATION, INTERNATIONAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKETS.

ALTERNATIVELY, POOR RATINGS MAY RESULT IN A TELEVISION SERIES CANCELLATION, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE IMMEDIATE WRITE-OFF OF ANY UNAMORTIZED PRODUCTION COSTS. A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE ADVERTISING MARKET WOULD ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ESTIMATES.

THE COST OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS ARE EXPENSED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF

TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. AMORTIZATION OF THOSE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ASSETS BEING AMORTIZED ON A NUMBER OF AIRINGS BASIS MAY BE ACCELERATED IF WE REDUCE THE

ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS AND SLOWED IF WE INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS. THE NUMBER OF FUTURE AIRINGS OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY THE PROGRAMS RATINGS IN PREVIOUS AIRINGS, EXPECTED ADVERTISING RATES AND

AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMMING. ACCORDINGLY, PLANNED USAGE IS REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND REVISED IF NECESSARY. RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASONS BASED ON THE

ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE OF EACH YEAR IN THE ARRANGEMENT. THE ESTIMATED VALUES OF EACH YEAR ARE BASED ON OUR PROJECTION OF REVENUES OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD WHICH INCLUDE ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE REVENUE. IF THE ANNUAL

CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON APPROXIMATE EACH SEASONS RELATIVE VALUE, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT DURING

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE APPLICABLE SEASON. IF PLANNED USAGE PATTERNS OR ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUES BY YEAR WERE TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY, AMORTIZATION OF THE OUR SPORTS RIGHTS COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED OR SLOWED.

COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS WHICH COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUES WITH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY

OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN, AND SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS

FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN-OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM. ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS ARE

LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR PROJECTIONS, FILM, TELEVISION AND PROGRAMMING COST WRITE-DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ITS VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE

CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH BUSINESS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THESE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES.

WE REDUCE HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND SOFTWARE PRODUCT REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED FUTURE RETURNS OF MERCHANDISE AND FOR CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND SALES INCENTIVES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL RETURN

EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD, WE MAY RECORD LESS REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS

EXCEED THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT. CONVERSELY, IF WE OVERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS FOR A PERIOD, WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS ARE LESS THAN ESTIMATED.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. FOR NON-EXPIRING, MULTI-DAY TICKETS, REVENUES ARE

RECOGNIZED OVER A THREE-YEAR TIME PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS. IF ACTUAL USAGE IS DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATED USAGE, REVENUES MAY NOT BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIODS THE RELATED SERVICES ARE

RENDERED. IN ADDITION, A CHANGE IN USAGE PATTERNS WOULD IMPACT THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.

PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

THE COMPANYS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE CALCULATED USING A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY MEASUREMENT WHICH WE

EVALUATE ANNUALLY. OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE AND EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS RETIREMENT PATTERNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER AND RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS FOR BENEFITS AS A PRESENT VALUE ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. A LOWER

DISCOUNT RATE INCREASES THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES PENSION EXPENSE. THE GUIDELINE FOR SETTING THIS RATE IS A HIGH-QUALITY LONG-TERM CORPORATE BOND RATE. WE DECREASED OUR DISCOUNT RATE TO 5.25% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2010

FROM 5.75% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009 TO REFLECT MARKET INTEREST RATE CONDITIONS AT OUR OCTOBER 2, 2010 MEASUREMENT DATE. THIS DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WILL AFFECT NET PERIODIC PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE (BENEFIT EXPENSE) IN

FISCAL 2011. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION

OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE TOTAL BENEFIT EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2011 BY

$199 MILLION AND WOULD INCREASE THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT OCTOBER 2, 2010 BY $1.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE TOTAL BENEFIT EXPENSE AND THE PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION BY $167 MILLION AND $1.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN

ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATION, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON EACH PLAN ASSET CLASS. A LOWER EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE. OUR LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN

ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.75% FOR THE 2010 AND 2009 ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN THE LONG-TERM ASSET RETURN ASSUMPTION WOULD IMPACT FISCAL 2011 ANNUAL BENEFIT EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $60 MILLION.

SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO TEST GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IF CURRENT

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE, ON AN INTERIM BASIS. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO

ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING

UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A

PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. WE APPLY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW ANALYSES ARE SENSITIVE TO OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARGINS FOR THESE BUSINESSES. WE INCLUDE IN THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUE WE BELIEVE THE REPORTING UNIT WOULD RECEIVE IF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

DEVELOPED BY THE REPORTING UNIT THAT IS BEING USED BY OTHER REPORTING UNITS WAS LICENSED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AT ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS THOSE INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS. WE BELIEVE OUR

ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE CONSISTENT WITH HOW A MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANT WOULD VALUE OUR REPORTING UNITS.

IN TIMES OF

ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A GREATER DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY TESTS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES (TRIGGERING EVENTS) INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ONCE A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST EMPLOYED IS BASED ON WHETHER THE INTENT IS TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR CONTINUED USE OR TO HOLD THE ASSET

FOR SALE. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR ASSETS HELD FOR USE REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET GROUP AGAINST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP. AN ASSET GROUP IS ESTABLISHED BY IDENTIFYING THE

LOWEST LEVEL OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY THE GROUP OF ASSETS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER ASSETS AND COULD INCLUDE ASSETS USED ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES OR SEGMENTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE

ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GROUPS LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS ALLOCATED TO THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OF THE GROUP ON A

PRO RATA BASIS USING THE RELATIVE CARRYING AMOUNT, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH ASSET IS ABOVE ITS FAIR VALUE. FOR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE ASSETS FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO

SELL, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE. DETERMINING WHETHER A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS IMPAIRED REQUIRES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING WHETHER A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ASSET GROUPS,

ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO DETERMINE THE ASSETS FAIR VALUE. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT ASSET GROUPS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER,

AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY HAS COST AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE

INVESTMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT FOR THESE INVESTMENTS, WE CONSIDER THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS

THE FORECASTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTEES AND MARKET VALUES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF THESE FORECASTS ARE NOT MET OR MARKET VALUES INDICATE AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.

DURING THE CURRENT YEAR, THE COMPANY TESTED ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT,

AND THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED WERE IMMATERIAL. DURING FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $279 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED $142 MILLION FOR FCC RADIO LICENSES AND $65 MILLION FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN UTV. DURING FISCAL

2008, THE COMPANY RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $39 MILLION RELATED TO FCC RADIO LICENSES. THE FCC RADIO LICENSE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REFLECTED OVERALL MARKET DECLINES IN CERTAIN RADIO MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES,

WHICH WERE ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WERE RECORDED IN RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

WE EVALUATE OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL

ACCOUNTS AND ESTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL BAD DEBT EXPERIENCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES WITH

49

WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. IN TIMES OF DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC TURMOIL, OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTIBILITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER UNCERTAINTY THAN IN

MORE STABLE PERIODS. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS IS TOO LOW, COSTS AND EXPENSES MAY INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND IF IT IS TOO HIGH, COST AND EXPENSES MAY DECREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LOSSES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS. THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED

IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND ARE BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR

ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE PROCEEDINGS. SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.

INCOME TAX AUDITS

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. OUR DETERMINATIONS

REGARDING THE RECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX BENEFITS ARE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE TAX AND LEGAL COUNSEL WHERE APPROPRIATE AND ARE BASED UPON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF OUR TAX POSITIONS IN CONSIDERATION OF APPLICABLE TAX STATUTES AND RELATED

INTERPRETATIONS AND PRECEDENTS AND UPON THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF PROCEEDINGS (OR NEGOTIATIONS) WITH TAXING AND LEGAL AUTHORITIES. THE TAX BENEFITS ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY THE COMPANY MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED

ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS DECISION TO SETTLE RATHER THAN LITIGATE A MATTER, RELEVANT LEGAL PRECEDENT RELATED TO SIMILAR MATTERS AND THE COMPANYS SUCCESS IN SUPPORTING ITS FILING POSITIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES.

STOCK OPTION COMPENSATION EXPENSE

EACH YEAR DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY AWARDS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO A BROAD-BASED GROUP OF MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL (THE ANNUAL GRANT). TO VALUE THESE AWARDS, THE

COMPANY USES A BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS VOLATILITY, DIVIDEND YIELD, AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE (THE MULTIPLE OF EXERCISE

PRICE TO GRANT PRICE AT WHICH EXERCISES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON AVERAGE) AND THE TERMINATION RATE (THE PROBABILITY OF A VESTED OPTION BEING CANCELLED DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE OPTION HOLDER) IN COMPUTING THE VALUE OF THE OPTION. ACCORDINGLY,

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL SHOULD PRODUCE A FAIR VALUE THAT IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VALUE OF AN EMPLOYEE OPTION.

IN FISCAL YEARS 2010, 2009, AND 2008, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OPTIONS-PRICING MODELS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL

FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS NOT ADJUSTED AFTER THE GRANT DATE, CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE THE VALUE OF, AND THEREFORE THE EXPENSE RELATED TO, FUTURE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE GREATEST VARIATION

IN FAIR VALUE IN THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ARE THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN EITHER THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE WILL CAUSE THE BINOMIAL OPTION VALUE TO INCREASE OR

DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION CONSIDERS BOTH HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE

COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION. IF THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF 32% USED BY THE COMPANY DURING 2010 WAS INCREASED OR

DECREASED BY FIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS (I.E. TO 37% OR TO 27%), THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR 2010 STOCK OPTION GRANTS WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY 9% OR DECREASED BY 9%, RESPECTIVELY.

THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE MAY BE INFLUENCED BY THE COMPANYS FUTURE STOCK PERFORMANCE, STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY, AND EMPLOYEE

TURNOVER RATES. IF THE EXERCISE MULTIPLE ASSUMPTION OF 1.4 USED BY THE COMPANY DURING 2010 WERE INCREASED TO 1.6 OR DECREASED TO 1.2, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE BINOMIAL VALUE OF OUR 2010 STOCK OPTION GRANTS WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY 10% OR DECREASED BY

12%, RESPECTIVELY.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE ON REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL YEAR. THE GUIDANCE REVISES

THE CRITERIA FOR SEPARATING, MEASURING, AND ALLOCATING ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION TO EACH DELIVERABLE IN A MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES COMPANIES TO ALLOCATE REVENUE USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE OF EACH DELIVERABLE, WHICH

MUST BE ESTIMATED IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A HISTORY OF SELLING THE DELIVERABLE ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS OR THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS TO ELIMINATE THE CONCEPT OF A QUALIFYING

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY, CHANGE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR OFF BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTING FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS INCLUDING LIMITING THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE OFF BALANCE SHEET TREATMENT FOR A PORTION OF A FINANCIAL ASSET IS ALLOWABLE, AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURES. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO REVISE THE APPROACH TO DETERMINE WHEN A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED. THE NEW CONSOLIDATION MODEL FOR VIES CONSIDERS WHETHER AN ENTITY

HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND SHARES IN THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND REWARDS OF THE VIE. THE GUIDANCE ON VIES REQUIRES COMPANIES TO CONTINUALLY REASSESS VIES TO

DETERMINE IF CONSOLIDATION IS APPROPRIATE AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY IS ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT THIS GUIDANCE WILL HAVE ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT DEFINES COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS. A COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT IS A CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENT THAT INVOLVES A JOINT OPERATING ACTIVITY, FOR EXAMPLE AN AGREEMENT TO CO-PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE A MOTION PICTURE WITH ANOTHER STUDIO. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT GUIDANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF

FISCAL YEAR 2010. THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT ESTABLISHES PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR DETERMINING HOW A

COMPANY RECOGNIZES AND MEASURES THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION, INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, AND CERTAIN ACQUIRED CONTINGENCIES. THE GUIDANCE ON BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS ALSO REQUIRES ACQUISITION-RELATED TRANSACTION EXPENSES AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS BE EXPENSED AS INCURRED RATHER THAN CAPITALIZED. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BUSINESS COMBINATION GUIDANCE PROSPECTIVELY AT THE BEGINNING OF

FISCAL YEAR 2010.

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST (MINORITY INTEREST)

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR A NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN A SUBSIDIARY WHICH REQUIRES

THAT NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS BE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND THAT NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY BE PRESENTED SEPARATELY IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS NONCONTROLLING INTEREST GUIDANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2010.

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE

FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CHANGES IN THAT FUNDED STATUS TO BE

RECOGNIZED IN COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR. THE GUIDANCE ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS ALSO REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF THE FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE RECOGNITION PROVISION

IN FISCAL YEAR 2007 WHICH RESULTED IN A $261 MILLION CHARGE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISION BY REMEASURING PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2009. ADOPTION OF

THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF $35 MILLION TO RETAINED EARNINGS AND A $100 MILLION BENEFIT TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INCOME TAX

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING A MINIMUM PROBABILITY THRESHOLD THAT A TAX POSITION MUST MEET BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS

RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE

TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE GUIDANCE ON INCOME TAXES AT

THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. APPLYING THE GUIDANCE ON INCOME TAXES TO ALL TAX POSITIONS UPON ADOPTION RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS OF $148 MILLION AND $15 MILLION TO RETAINED EARNINGS AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, RESPECTIVELY.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE WRITTEN OR ORAL STATEMENTS

THAT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING, INCLUDING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND IN REPORTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. SUCH STATEMENTS MAY, FOR EXAMPLE, EXPRESS EXPECTATIONS OR

PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE ACTIONS THAT WE MAY TAKE, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING OR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, OR ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL INCLUDING CHANGES IN DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE MADE ON THE BASIS OF

MANAGEMENTS VIEWS AND ASSUMPTIONS AS OF THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE THESE STATEMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WILL NECESSARILY COME TO PASS. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS

AFFECTING THESE EXPECTATIONS ARE SET FORTH UNDER ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, AND THE FAIR MARKET

VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN

MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE

TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW IN ORDER TO ALLOW

MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY

ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS, AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY

COMMITTED, TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE PRINCIPAL FOREIGN CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY

SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES

GENERALLY FOR PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED FOUR YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS ARE TO USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES. THE AMOUNTS HEDGED

USING COMMODITY SWAP CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON FORECASTED LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES, SUCH AS FUEL OIL AND GASOLINE.

IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS

STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY OTHER HEDGING TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VALUE AT RISK (VAR)

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VAR MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE,

AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES WERE MADE ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED IN A VAR COMPUTATION. THE COMPANYS COMPUTATIONS ARE

BASED ON THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES, AND EQUITY PRICES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS WERE DETERMINED BY OBSERVING INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY, AND EQUITY MARKET

CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING QUARTER FOR THE CALCULATION OF VAR AMOUNTS AT FISCAL YEAR END. THE MODEL INCLUDES ALL OF THE COMPANYS DEBT AS WELL AS ALL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH CERTAIN OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WILL BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY,

NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS.

VAR ON A COMBINED BASIS DECREASED TO $33

MILLION AT OCTOBER 2, 2010 FROM $34 MILLION AT OCTOBER 3, 2009. THE DECREASE IN VAR PRIMARILY REFLECTED A DECREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF FIXED RATE DEBT DURING THE YEAR OFFSET BY HIGHER VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES

AND DECREASED DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS ACROSS FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR

VALUE, CALCULATED USING THE VAR MODEL, IS AS FOLLOWS (UNAUDITED, IN MILLIONS).

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY

AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO

FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL

OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE

TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON OUR EVALUATION UNDER THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK,

MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2010.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2010 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS

LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT OCTOBER 2, 2010 AND OCTOBER 3, 2009, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED

OCTOBER 2, 2010 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

OCTOBER 2, 2010, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO

INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES IN 2008, ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS IN 2009 AND ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR AND REPORTING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN 2010.

A COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS

AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT

RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS

INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF

CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS MAJORITY-OWNED AND CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN

ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. IN DECEMBER 1999, DVD FINANCING, INC. (DFI), A SUBSIDIARY OF DISNEY VACATION DEVELOPMENT, INC. AND AN INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, COMPLETED A RECEIVABLE SALE TRANSACTION THAT ESTABLISHED A FACILITY THAT PERMITTED

DFI TO SELL RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE SALE OF VACATION CLUB MEMBERSHIPS ON A PERIODIC BASIS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS FACILITY, DFI PREPARES SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH ITS SEPARATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE ALSO CONSOLIDATED IN THESE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. DFIS ABILITY TO SELL NEW RECEIVABLES UNDER THIS FACILITY ENDED ON DECEMBER 4, 2008. (SEE NOTE 16 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS FACILITY)

REPORTING PERIOD

THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE

SATURDAY CLOSEST TO SEPTEMBER 30 AND CONSISTS OF FIFTY-TWO WEEKS WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS, WE HAVE A FIFTY-THREE WEEK YEAR. WHEN A FIFTY-THREE WEEK YEAR OCCURS, THE COMPANY REPORTS THE ADDITIONAL WEEK IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER. FISCAL 2009 WAS A FIFTY-THREE WEEK YEAR BEGINNING ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2008 AND ENDING ON OCTOBER 3, 2009.

PRESENTATION.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND FOOTNOTES THERETO. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

BROADCAST ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN COMMERCIALS ARE AIRED. REVENUES FROM TELEVISION SUBSCRIPTION

SERVICES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS PRIMARY CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CONTRACTS WITH CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS INCLUDE ANNUAL LIVE PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS. IN THESE

CASES, RECOGNITION OF REVENUES SUBJECT TO THE COMMITMENTS IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE ANNUAL COMMITMENTS ARE SATISFIED, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. FOR NON-EXPIRING, MULTI-DAY TICKETS, REVENUES ARE

RECOGNIZED OVER A THREE-YEAR TIME PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS.

REVENUES

AVAILABLE FOR SALE BY RETAILERS. REVENUES FROM THE LICENSING OF FEATURE FILMS AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ARE RECORDED WHEN THE CONTENT IS AVAILABLE FOR TELECAST BY THE LICENSEE AND WHEN CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS ARE MET.

MERCHANDISE LICENSING ADVANCES AND GUARANTEE ROYALTY PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL ROYALTY RATE WHEN THE LICENSED

PRODUCT IS SOLD BY THE LICENSEE. NON-REFUNDABLE ADVANCES AND MINIMUM GUARANTEE ROYALTY PAYMENTS IN EXCESS OF ROYALTIES EARNED ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AT THE END OF THE CONTRACT TERM.

REVENUES FROM OUR INTERNET AND MOBILE OPERATIONS ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED. ADVERTISING REVENUES AT OUR INTERNET OPERATIONS

ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN ADVERTISEMENTS ARE VIEWED ONLINE.

TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES

ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME ON A NET BASIS.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS TO RESERVE FOR POTENTIALLY UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES. THE

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS IS ESTIMATED BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF TRENDS IN OVERALL RECEIVABLES AGING, SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF CERTAIN RECEIVABLES THAT ARE AT RISK OF NOT BEING PAID, PAST COLLECTION EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS. IN

TIMES OF DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC TURMOIL, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS RECEIVABLES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER UNCERTAINTY THAN IN MORE STABLE PERIODS.

ADVERTISING EXPENSE

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2010, 2009 AND 2008 WAS $2.6 BILLION, $2.7 BILLION AND $2.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH ON HAND AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS.

INVESTMENTS

INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND REPORTED AT AMORTIZED COST. DEBT SECURITIES NOT CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER TRADING OR

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. TRADING AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN EARNINGS OR ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME/ (LOSS), RESPECTIVELY. ALL OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING EITHER THE COST METHOD OR THE EQUITY METHOD.

THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW THE COST BASIS IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY.

IF THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COST BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE.

TRANSLATION POLICY

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR

THE MAJORITY OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR EURO DISNEY, HONG KONG DISNEYLAND, AND INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS OF THE DISNEY STORES.

FOR U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY LOCATIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REMEASURED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT END-OF-PERIOD

EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR NONMONETARY BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING EACH PERIOD, EXCEPT FOR THOSE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE

NON-MONETARY BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME.

FOR LOCAL CURRENCY FUNCTIONAL LOCATIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED AT END-OF-PERIOD RATES WHILE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD. EQUITY IS

TRANSLATED AT HISTORICAL RATES AND THE RESULTING CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORY PRIMARILY INCLUDES VACATION TIMESHARE UNITS,

MERCHANDISE, MATERIALS, AND SUPPLIES. CARRYING AMOUNTS OF VACATION OWNERSHIP UNITS ARE RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. CARRYING AMOUNTS OF MERCHANDISE, MATERIALS, AND SUPPLIES INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A MOVING

AVERAGE COST BASIS AND ARE RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS INCLUDE CAPITALIZABLE PRODUCTION COSTS, PRODUCTION OVERHEAD, INTEREST, DEVELOPMENT COSTS, AND ACQUIRED

PRODUCTION COSTS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR FAIR VALUE. ACQUIRED PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR THE COMPANYS TELEVISION AND CABLE NETWORKS ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR

NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ACQUIRED TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE RECORDED WHEN THE LICENSE PERIOD BEGINS AND THE PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE FOR USE. MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION, PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS ARE EXPENSED BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS

REVENUES TO ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FOR EACH PRODUCTION. FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION

NETWORK SERIES, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER. FOR ACQUIRED FILM LIBRARIES,

REMAINING REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO BE EARNED FOR UP TO TWENTY YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS WHICH COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WITH THE

UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS EXCEED THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES IS WRITTEN OFF. FILM DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED OR HAVE NOT BEEN SET FOR PRODUCTION

WITHIN THREE YEARS ARE GENERALLY WRITTEN OFF.

THE COSTS OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER

PROGRAMS ARE EXPENSED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED DURING THE APPLICABLE

SEASONS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE OF EACH SEASON IN THE ARRANGEMENT. THE ESTIMATED VALUES OF EACH SEASON ARE BASED ON OUR PROJECTIONS OF REVENUES OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD WHICH INCLUDE ADVERTISING REVENUES AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE

FEES. IF THE CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON APPROXIMATE EACH SEASONS RELATIVE VALUE, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED PAYMENT DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN-OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE

PROGRAM.

THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF NETWORK TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS

ARE REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN, AND

SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL.

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE COSTS

THE COMPANY EXPENSES COSTS INCURRED IN

THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE OF DEVELOPING OR ACQUIRING INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE, SUCH AS RESEARCH AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES, AS WELL AS COSTS INCURRED IN THE POST-IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONAL STAGE, SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING. CAPITALIZATION OF

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OCCURS ONLY AFTER THE PRELIMINARY-PROJECT STAGE IS COMPLETE, MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZES THE PROJECT, AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETED AND THE SOFTWARE WILL BE USED FOR THE FUNCTION INTENDED. AS OF

OCTOBER 2, 2010 AND OCTOBER 3, 2009, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS, NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION, TOTALED $476 MILLION AND $595 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE, RANGING FROM 3-10 YEARS.

SOFTWARE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS

SOFTWARE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCURRED PRIOR TO REACHING TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY ARE EXPENSED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF OUR VIDEO GAME SOFTWARE IS GENERALLY NOT ESTABLISHED UNTIL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS COMPLETE.

PARKS, RESORTS AND OTHER PROPERTY

PARKS, RESORTS, AND OTHER

PROPERTY ARE CARRIED AT HISTORICAL COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED ON THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AS FOLLOWS.

ATTRACTIONS

25  40 YEARS

BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS

GOODWILL, OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO TEST GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IF CURRENT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE, ON AN INTERIM BASIS. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE REPORTING LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING

SEGMENT. THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED

TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY

MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. WE APPLY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. WE INCLUDE IN THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUE WE BELIEVE THE

REPORTING UNIT WOULD RECEIVE IF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE REPORTING UNIT THAT IS BEING USED BY OTHER REPORTING UNITS WAS LICENSED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AT ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS

THOSE INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS.

IN TIMES OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE

COMPANYS LONG-TERM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A GREATER DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD

DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE

DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY TESTS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR

IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (TRIGGERING EVENTS) INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ONCE A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST EMPLOYED IS BASED ON WHETHER THE INTENT IS TO HOLD THE

ASSET FOR CONTINUED USE OR TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR SALE. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR ASSETS HELD FOR USE REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET GROUP AGAINST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP. AN

ASSET GROUP IS ESTABLISHED BY IDENTIFYING THE LOWEST LEVEL OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY THE GROUP OF ASSETS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER ASSETS AND COULD INCLUDE ASSETS USED ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES OR SEGMENTS. IF THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GROUPS LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE IMPAIRMENT IS

ALLOCATED TO THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OF THE GROUP ON A PRO RATA BASIS USING THE RELATIVE CARRYING AMOUNT, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET IS ABOVE ITS FAIR VALUE. FOR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE IS

GREATER THAN THE ASSETS FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE.

DURING THE

CURRENT YEAR, THE COMPANY TESTED ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT, AND THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED WERE IMMATERIAL. DURING FISCAL YEARS 2009 AND 2008, THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $142 MILLION AND $39

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO FCC RADIO LICENSES. DURING FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDED A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TOTALING $29 MILLION. THE FCC RADIO LICENSE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REFLECTED OVERALL MARKET DECLINES IN CERTAIN RADIO

MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. THE FCC RADIO LICENSE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, WHICH WERE DETERMINED BASED ON A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WERE RECORDED IN RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

INCOME.

AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER PERIODS UP TO 40 YEARS. THE COSTS

TO PERIODICALLY RENEW OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO LEGAL, COMPETITIVE, ECONOMIC OR OTHER FACTORS THAT MATERIALLY LIMIT THE USEFUL LIFE OF OUR FCC LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS AGGREGATE ANNUAL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR EXISTING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR FISCAL YEARS

2011 THROUGH 2015 TO BE AS FOLLOWS.

RISK MANAGEMENT

CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS

EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS; FORWARD, OPTION AND SWAPTION CONTRACTS AND INTEREST

RATE CAPS.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS RISK

MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR UNDERTAKING VARIOUS HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DERIVATIVES INTO WHICH THE COMPANY ENTERS: HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AND HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE. HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE ARE

ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED ASSET, LIABILITY, OR A FIRM COMMITMENT. HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION (E.G. FORECASTED REVENUE) OR THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS

TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED, RELATED TO A RECOGNIZED LIABILITY OR ASSET (E.G. FLOATING RATE DEBT).

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES AND

ASSIGNS THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFIC ASSETS OR SPECIFIC LIABILITIES. WHEN HEDGED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE SOLD OR EXTINGUISHED OR THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO OCCUR,

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

OPTION PREMIUMS AND UNREALIZED GAINS ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL

FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS OTHER ASSETS. UNREALIZED LOSSES ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE

PAID UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LIABILITIES. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES THE DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST

RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS AS INTEREST RATES AND EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIVES OF THE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE TERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE SWAP AGREEMENTS,

PRIOR TO THEIR ORIGINAL MATURITY, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THESE CONTRACTS ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET CERTAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURES OF THE

COMPANY AND ARE CARRIED AT MARKET VALUE WITH ANY CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED ASSETS,

LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (SEE NOTES 9 AND 17).

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND WHEN APPROPRIATE, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED WITH

RESPECT TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IN THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF ITEMS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. WHERE, BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME AMOUNT OF RECORDED

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THAT AMOUNT THAT, IN MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, IS SUFFICIENT TO REDUCE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING A MINIMUM PROBABILITY THRESHOLD

THAT A TAX POSITION MUST MEET BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING

RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED

UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE ON ITS INCOME TAX POSITIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2008 WHICH RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS OF $148 MILLION AND $15 MILLION TO RETAINED EARNINGS AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS,

RESPECTIVELY.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

THE COMPANY PRESENTS BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AMOUNTS. BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR.

DILUTED EPS IS BASED UPON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR WHICH IS CALCULATED USING THE TREASURY-STOCK METHOD FOR EQUITY-BASED AWARDS (AWARDS) AND ASSUMES CONVERSION OF THE

COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES WHICH WERE REDEEMED DURING FISCAL 2008 (SEE NOTE 12). COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION IN PERIODS FOR WHICH THEY HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT. STOCK OPTIONS FOR WHICH THE EXERCISE

PRICE EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OVER THE PERIOD ARE ANTI-DILUTIVE AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION.

3 NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES

IN OCTOBER 2009,

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE ON REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL YEAR. THE GUIDANCE REVISES THE CRITERIA FOR SEPARATING, MEASURING, AND ALLOCATING

ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION TO EACH DELIVERABLE IN A MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES COMPANIES TO ALLOCATE REVENUE USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE OF EACH DELIVERABLE, WHICH MUST BE ESTIMATED IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A HISTORY

OF SELLING THE DELIVERABLE ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS OR THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS TO ELIMINATE THE CONCEPT OF A QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY, CHANGE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR OFF BALANCE SHEET

ACCOUNTING FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS INCLUDING LIMITING THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE OFF BALANCE SHEET TREATMENT FOR A PORTION OF A FINANCIAL ASSET IS ALLOWABLE, AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL

YEAR. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO REVISE THE APPROACH TO DETERMINE WHEN A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED. THE NEW CONSOLIDATION MODEL FOR VIES CONSIDERS WHETHER AN ENTITY

HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND SHARES IN THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND REWARDS OF THE ENTITY. THE GUIDANCE ON VIES REQUIRES COMPANIES TO CONTINUALLY REASSESS VIES TO

DETERMINE IF CONSOLIDATION IS APPROPRIATE AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY IS ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT THIS GUIDANCE WILL HAVE ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT DEFINES COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS. A COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT IS A CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENT THAT INVOLVES A JOINT OPERATING ACTIVITY, FOR EXAMPLE AN AGREEMENT TO CO-PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE A MOTION PICTURE WITH ANOTHER STUDIO. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT GUIDANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF

FISCAL YEAR 2010. THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT ESTABLISHES PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR DETERMINING HOW A COMPANY RECOGNIZES AND

MEASURES THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION, INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, AND CERTAIN ACQUIRED CONTINGENCIES. THE GUIDANCE ON BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ALSO REQUIRES

ACQUISITION-RELATED TRANSACTION EXPENSES AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS BE EXPENSED AS INCURRED RATHER THAN CAPITALIZED. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS BUSINESS COMBINATION GUIDANCE AND APPLIED THE GUIDANCE PROSPECTIVELY AT THE BEGINNING OF

FISCAL YEAR 2010.

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST (MINORITY INTEREST)

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR A NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN A SUBSIDIARY WHICH REQUIRES

THAT NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS BE REPORTED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND THAT NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY BE PRESENTED SEPARATELY IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS NONCONTROLLING INTEREST GUIDANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2010.

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CHANGES IN THAT FUNDED STATUS TO

BE RECOGNIZED IN COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR. THE GUIDANCE ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS ALSO REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF THE FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE RECOGNITION

PROVISION IN FISCAL YEAR 2007 WHICH RESULTED IN A $261 MILLION CHARGE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISION BY REMEASURING PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2009.

ADOPTION OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF $35 MILLION TO RETAINED EARNINGS AND A $100 MILLION BENEFIT TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2009 WERE 7.80% FOR THE DISCOUNT RATE, 7.50% FOR THE RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, AND

5.00% FOR SALARY INCREASES. BASED ON THIS MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS DECREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $214 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO $255 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. THE DECREASE IN

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

INCOME TAX

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE WHICH CLARIFIES

THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING A MINIMUM PROBABILITY THRESHOLD THAT A TAX POSITION MUST MEET BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE

SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF

BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE GUIDANCE ON INCOME TAXES AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. APPLYING THE GUIDANCE ON INCOME TAXES TO ALL TAX POSITIONS UPON

ADOPTION RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS OF $148 MILLION AND $15 MILLION TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS AND NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, RESPECTIVELY.

ACQUISITIONS

PLAYDOM

ON AUGUST 27, 2010, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED PLAYDOM, INC. (PLAYDOM), A COMPANY THAT DEVELOPS ONLINE SOCIAL GAMES. THIS ACQUISITION IS DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN THE COMPANYS DIGITAL GAMING PORTFOLIO

CONDITIONS AND RECOGNIZED AS POST-CLOSE COMPENSATION EXPENSE. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION OF UP TO $200 MILLION MAY BE PAID IF PLAYDOM ACHIEVES PREDEFINED REVENUES AND EARNINGS TARGETS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2012. THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED THE FAIR VALUE

(DETERMINED BY A PROBABILITY WEIGHTING OF THE POTENTIAL PAYOUTS) OF THE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION AS A

THE DISNEY STORE JAPAN

ON MARCH 31, 2010, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF RETAIL NETWORKS COMPANY LIMITED (THE DISNEY STORE JAPAN) IN EXCHANGE FOR A $17 MILLION NOTE. AT THE TIME OF THE ACQUISITION,

THE DISNEY STORE JAPAN HAD A CASH BALANCE OF $13 MILLION. IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A $22 MILLION NON-CASH GAIN FROM THE DEEMED TERMINATION OF THE EXISTING LICENSING ARRANGEMENT. THE GAIN IS REPORTED IN OTHER

MARVEL

ON DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A CASH AND STOCK ACQUISITION FOR THE OUTSTANDING CAPITAL STOCK OF MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT,

INC. (MARVEL), A CHARACTER-BASED ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY. THIS ACQUISITION IS CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC VALUE CREATION THROUGH UTILIZATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES ACROSS DISNEYS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS AND TERRITORIES.

THE ACQUISITION PURCHASE PRICE TOTALED $4.2 BILLION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THE ACQUISITION, MARVEL SHAREHOLDERS

PRICE OF $32.25).

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ALLOCATE THE PURCHASE PRICE TO TANGIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES. THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THOSE FAIR VALUES IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL.

NBC UNIVERSAL (NBCU) HELD 25%. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR THE TRANSACTION AS A SALE OF A PORTION OF ITS INTEREST IN LIFETIME WHICH RESULTED IN A $228 MILLION NON-CASH PRE-TAX GAIN ($142 MILLION

AFTER-TAX) REFLECTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMPANYS CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIFETIME INTEREST SOLD AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INCREMENTAL AETN INTEREST RECEIVED. FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTION THE COMPANYS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE

COMBINED AETN/LIFETIME IS APPROXIMATELY 42%. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, NBCU MAY ELECT OR BE REQUIRED TO EXIT THE COMBINED AETN/LIFETIME OVER A PERIOD OF UP TO 15 YEARS, IN WHICH EVENT THE COMPANY AND HEARST WOULD EACH OWN 50%. THE COMPANY

ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INTEREST IN THE COMBINED AETN/LIFETIME AS AN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT CONSISTENT WITH HOW IT PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR AETN AND LIFETIME.

JETIX EUROPE

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED AN ADDITIONAL

26% INTEREST IN JETIX EUROPE N.V., A PUBLICLY TRADED PAN-EUROPEAN KIDS ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, FOR APPROXIMATELY $354 MILLION (BRINGING OUR TOTAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST TO OVER 99%). THE COMPANY INTENDS TO ACQUIRE THE REMAINING OUTSTANDING SHARES

THROUGH MARKET PURCHASES AND OTHER MEANS.

UTV

ON MAY 9, 2008, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A 24% INTEREST (BRINGING ITS UNDILUTED INTEREST TO 37%) IN UTV SOFTWARE COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED

(UTV), A MEDIA COMPANY HEADQUARTERED AND PUBLICLY TRADED IN INDIA, FOR APPROXIMATELY $197 MILLION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDIAN SECURITIES REGULATIONS, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE AN OPEN TENDER OFFER TO PURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 23% OF

UTVS PUBLICLY TRADED VOTING SHARES FOR A PRICE EQUIVALENT TO THE MAY 9TH, 2008 INDIAN RUPEE PURCHASE PRICE. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE OPEN OFFER AND ACQUIRED AN INCREMENTAL 23% OF UTVS VOTING SHARES FOR

APPROXIMATELY $138 MILLION BRINGING ITS UNDILUTED INTEREST TO 60%. DUE TO THE CHANGE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN THE US DOLLAR AND THE INDIAN RUPEE FROM MAY TO NOVEMBER, THE US DOLLAR PRICE PER SHARE WAS LOWER IN NOVEMBER THAN IN MAY. UTVS

FOUNDER HAS A FOUR-YEAR OPTION WHICH EXPIRES IN NOVEMBER 2012 TO BUY ALL OR A PORTION OF THE SHARES ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE OPEN-OFFER PERIOD AT A PRICE NO LESS THAN THE COMPANYS OPEN-OFFER PRICE. IF THE TRADING PRICE UPON EXERCISE

OF THE OPTION EXCEEDS THE PRICE PAID BY THE COMPANY, THEN THE OPTION PRICE IS CAPPED AT THE COMPANYS OPEN-OFFER PRICE PLUS A 10% ANNUAL RETURN. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE THE SHARES SUBJECT TO THE OPTION UNTIL THE EXPIRATION

OF THE OPTION AND ACCORDINGLY THE COMPANYS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN VOTING SHARES IS 48%. IN JANUARY 2010, UTV ISSUED ADDITIONAL SHARES IN EXCHANGE FOR THE OUTSTANDING NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OF ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES DILUTING THE COMPANYS

DIRECT INTEREST IN UTV TO 50% (39% VOTING INTEREST) WHILE INCREASING THE COMPANYS INDIRECT INTEREST IN THE SUBSIDIARY. IN ADDITION TO THE ACQUISITION OF UTV, ON AUGUST 5, 2008, THE COMPANY INVESTED $28 MILLION IN A UTV SUBSIDIARY, UTV

GLOBAL BROADCASTING LIMITED (ALONG WITH UTV, THE UTV GROUP). THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN THE UTV GROUP IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD.

IN FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY WROTE DOWN ITS INVESTMENT IN UTV TO FAIR VALUE AND RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TOTALING $65 MILLION. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN UTV WAS

ESTIMATED BASED ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL VALUATION OF THE UTV BUSINESS USING AN INCOME APPROACH (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL). THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE PRINCIPAL MARKET FOR ITS LONG-TERM STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN UTV WOULD BE A PRIVATELY

NEGOTIATED TRANSACTION WITH ANOTHER STRATEGIC INVESTOR AND THAT THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS MARKET WOULD VALUE THIS INVESTMENT USING THE INCOME APPROACH. ACCORDINGLY, THE INCOME APPROACH PROVIDED THE MOST APPROPRIATE INDICATOR OF FAIR VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN UTV RATHER THAN THE PRICE OF INDIVIDUAL SHARES TRADED ON INDIAN STOCK EXCHANGES. THE VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN THE UTV GROUP BASED ON THE CURRENT TRADING PRICE EXCEEDS THE BOOK VALUE OF $253 MILLION AT

OCTOBER 2, 2010 BY APPROXIMATELY 5%.

THE DISNEY STORES NORTH AMERICA

ON APRIL 30, 2008, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED CERTAIN ASSETS OF THE DISNEY STORES NORTH AMERICA FOR APPROXIMATELY $64 MILLION IN CASH FROM,

AND TERMINATED ITS LONG-TERM LICENSING ARRANGEMENT FOR THE DISNEY STORES WITH, THE CHILDRENS PLACE, THE FORMER LICENSEE. THE COMPANY ACQUIRED THE INVENTORY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, AND CERTAIN FIXED ASSETS OF, AND ASSUMED THE LEASES ON, 229

STORES. THE COMPANY CONDUCTED THE WIND-DOWN AND CLOSURE OF AN ADDITIONAL 88 STORES BUT DID NOT ASSUME THE LEASES ON THESE STORES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY WAIVED ITS RIGHTS TO CERTAIN CLAIMS AGAINST THE CHILDRENS PLACE AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RECORDED AN $18 MILLION

NON-CASH GAIN FOR THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE CLAIMS. THE GAIN IS CLASSIFIED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE PRINCIPALLY RELATES TO A $375 MILLION DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR THE NONCONTROLLING

INTEREST SHARE OF OPERATING LOSSES AT EURO DISNEY. THE ULTIMATE UTILIZATION OF THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST SHARE OF THE NET OPERATING LOSSES, WHICH HAVE AN INDEFINITE CARRYFORWARD PERIOD, WOULD NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S NET INCOME

ATTRIBUTABLE TO DISNEY AS ANY INCOME TAX BENEFIT WOULD BE OFFSET BY A CHARGE TO NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE INCOME STATEMENT.

AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2010, THE COMPANY HAD UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OF APPROXIMATELY $167 MILLION FOR WHICH DEFERRED TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REINVEST

THESE EARNINGS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IF THESE AMOUNTS WERE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES, IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHERWISE, THE COMPANY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL U.S. INCOME TAXES. ASSUMING THE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED FOREIGN

EARNINGS WERE REPATRIATED UNDER LAWS AND RATES APPLICABLE AT 2010 FISCAL YEAR END, THE INCREMENTAL U.S. TAX APPLICABLE TO THE EARNINGS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION.

THE

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

MADE A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO THE INCOME TAX LAWS INCLUDING THE

CREATION OF A DEDUCTION FOR QUALIFYING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE DEDUCTION EQUALS THREE PERCENT OF QUALIFYING NET INCOME FOR FISCAL 2007, SIX PERCENT FOR FISCAL 2008 THROUGH 2010, AND NINE PERCENT FOR FISCAL 2011 AND THEREAFTER. OUR TAX

PROVISIONS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2010, 2009, AND 2008 REFLECT BENEFITS OF $111 MILLION, $100 MILLION AND $97 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING FROM THIS DEDUCTION.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR INCOME TAXES AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. SEE NOTE 2 FOR THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THIS GUIDANCE.

THE YEAR END 2010 AND 2009 BALANCES INCLUDE $473 MILLION AND $367 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, THAT IF RECOGNIZED,

WOULD REDUCE OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NET OF THE OFFSETTING BENEFITS FROM OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS.

AS OF YEAR END 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY HAD $163 MILLION AND $142 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN ACCRUED INTEREST RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. DURING 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY ACCRUED ADDITIONAL

INTEREST OF $28 MILLION AND $27 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND RECORDED REDUCTIONS IN ACCRUED INTEREST OF $7 MILLION AND $12 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS A RESULT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS AND OTHER PRIOR-YEAR ADJUSTMENTS. THE COMPANYS POLICY IS TO REPORT

INTEREST AND PENALTIES AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

DURING THE CURRENT YEAR, THE COMPANY RESOLVED VARIOUS REFUND

CLAIMS AND OTHER MATTERS WITH TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX AUDITS. THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION IN ANY OF ITS MAJOR STATE OR FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS FOR YEARS

PRIOR TO 2003.

IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD CHANGE DUE TO

THE RESOLUTION OF TAX MATTERS, INCLUDING PAYMENTS ON THE TAX MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THESE RESOLUTIONS AND PAYMENTS COULD REDUCE OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS BY $44 MILLION.

IN FISCAL 2010, INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS EXCEEDED THE AMOUNTS RECORDED BASED ON GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, $61 MILLION WAS CREDITED TO

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. IN FISCAL YEAR 2009, INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS WERE LESS THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED AT GRANT DATE AND A SHORTFALL OF $26 MILLION WAS CHARGED TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. IN

FISCAL YEAR 2008,

11 PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PROGRAMS

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS COVERING MOST OF ITS EMPLOYEES NOT COVERED BY UNION OR INDUSTRY-WIDE PLANS. EMPLOYEES GENERALLY HIRED AFTER JANUARY 1, 1994 AND

EMPLOYEES GENERALLY HIRED AFTER JANUARY 1, 1987 FOR CERTAIN OF OUR MEDIA BUSINESSES ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. WITH RESPECT TO ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, THE COMPANYS POLICY IS TO FUND, AT A MINIMUM, THE

AMOUNT NECESSARY ON AN ACTUARIAL BASIS TO PROVIDE FOR BENEFITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED BY THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 (PPA). PENSION BENEFITS ARE GENERALLY BASED

ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND/OR COMPENSATION.

THE PRIMARY INVESTMENT

OBJECTIVE FOR THE ASSETS WITHIN THE MASTER TRUST IS TO PRUDENTLY AND COST EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ASSETS TO FULFILL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. FINANCIAL RISKS ARE MANAGED THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION OF PLAN ASSETS, SELECTION OF INVESTMENT

MANAGERS AND THROUGH THE INVESTMENT GUIDELINES INCORPORATED INTO INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. ASSETS ARE MONITORED TO ENSURE THAT INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE COMMENSURATE WITH RISKS TAKEN.

THE LONG-TERM ASSET ALLOCATION POLICY FOR THE MASTER TRUST WAS ESTABLISHED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT INCLUDE,

BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE AVERAGE AGE OF PARTICIPANTS, THE NUMBER OF RETIREES, THE DURATION OF LIABILITIES AND THE EXPECTED PAYOUT RATIO. LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF THE MASTER TRUST ARE GENERALLY MANAGED USING CASH GENERATED BY INVESTMENTS OR BY

LIQUIDATING SECURITIES.

ASSETS ARE GENERALLY MANAGED BY EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND WE HAVE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT

AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO SECURITIES IN THE MASTER TRUST. THESE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE ACCOUNT GUIDELINES THAT ESTABLISH PERMITTED SECURITIES AND RISK CONTROLS COMMENSURATE WITH THE ACCOUNTS INVESTMENT STRATEGY. SOME AGREEMENTS PERMIT THE USE OF

DERIVATIVE SECURITIES (FUTURES, OPTIONS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS) THAT ENABLE INVESTMENT MANAGERS TO ENHANCE RETURNS AND MANAGE EXPOSURES WITHIN THEIR ACCOUNTS. INVESTMENT MANAGERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM USING DERIVATIVES TO LEVERAGE

RETURNS.

ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS ARE NET OF EXPECTED MEDICARE SUBSIDY RECEIPTS OF $71 MILLION.

ASSUMPTIONS

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS THE DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE, HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR NET PERIODIC BENEFIT

COST AS WELL AS THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

DISCOUNT RATE

 THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE FOR PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS REFLECTS THE MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH

QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

 THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM

RETURNS ON AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTING OF A MIXTURE OF EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME AND ALTERNATIVE

INVESTMENTS. WHEN DETERMINING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON THE ASSET CLASSES (BOTH HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED) IN WHICH THE

COMPANY EXPECTS THE PENSION FUNDS TO BE INVESTED. THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN BY ASSET CLASS WERE CONSIDERED IN SETTING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION.

EQUITY SECURITIES

10%11%

DEBT SECURITIES

4%  7%

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS

HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE

 THE COMPANY REVIEWS EXTERNAL DATA AND ITS OWN HISTORICAL TRENDS FOR HEALTHCARE COSTS TO

DETERMINE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATES FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS. FOR THE 2010 ACTUARIAL VALUATION, WE ASSUMED AN 8.25% ANNUAL RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE CLAIMS WITH THE RATE DECREASING IN

EVEN INCREMENTS OVER TWELVE YEARS UNTIL REACHING 4.75%.

13 EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

UNDER VARIOUS PLANS, THE COMPANY MAY GRANT STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY-BASED AWARDS TO EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT, AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL.

THE COMPANYS APPROACH TO LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION CONTEMPLATES AWARDS OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS). CERTAIN RSUS AWARDED TO SENIOR EXECUTIVES VEST BASED UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF MARKET AND/OR PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS

(PERFORMANCE RSUS).

STOCK OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY GRANTED AT EXERCISE PRICES EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING THE MARKET PRICE AT THE DATE

OF GRANT. EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2003, OPTIONS BECAME EXERCISABLE RATABLY OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE GRANT DATE, WHILE OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 2003 GENERALLY VEST RATABLY OVER FIVE YEARS. EFFECTIVE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010, OPTIONS

GRANTED GENERALLY EXPIRE TEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE. OPTIONS GRANTED BETWEEN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005 AND THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010 EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS FROM THE GRANT DATE WHILE OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005 GENERALLY

EXPIRE TEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE. AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OPTIONS CAN OCCASIONALLY EXTEND UP TO 15 YEARS AFTER DATE OF GRANT. EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2009, RSUS (EXCLUDING

PERFORMANCE RSUS) VEST RATABLY OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, WHILE RSUS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 2009 AND PERFORMANCE RSUS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 2010 GENERALLY VEST 50% ON EACH OF THE SECOND AND FOURTH ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT

DATE. EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2010, PERFORMANCE RSUS CLIFF VEST AFTER A THREE YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT. STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS ARE GENERALLY FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES WHO TERMINATE PRIOR TO VESTING. SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE OPTION AND RSU

GRANTS AT OCTOBER 2, 2010 TOTALED 117 MILLION. STARTING MARCH 2009 FOR OUR PRIMARY PLAN, EACH SHARE GRANTED SUBJECT TO A STOCK OPTION AWARD REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE BY ONE SHARE WHILE EACH SHARE GRANTED SUBJECT TO A RSU AWARD

REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE BY TWO SHARES. THE COMPANY SATISFIES STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF RSUS WITH NEWLY ISSUED SHARES.

EACH YEAR, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY AWARDS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO A BROAD-BASED GROUP OF MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL (THE ANNUAL GRANT). THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS

IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS VOLATILITY, DIVIDEND YIELD, AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED EXERCISE

MULTIPLE (THE MULTIPLE OF EXERCISE PRICE TO GRANT PRICE AT WHICH EXERCISES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON AVERAGE) AND THE TERMINATION RATE (THE PROBABILITY OF A VESTED OPTION BEING CANCELLED DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE OPTION HOLDER) IN COMPUTING THE

VALUE OF THE OPTION.

IN FISCAL YEARS 2010, 2009 AND 2008, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OPTION-VALUATION MODEL

WERE AS FOLLOWS.

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS NOT ADJUSTED AFTER THE GRANT DATE,

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE THE VALUE OF, AND THEREFORE THE EXPENSE RELATED TO, FUTURE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE GREATEST VARIATION IN FAIR VALUE IN THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ARE THE EXPECTED

VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN EITHER THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE WILL CAUSE THE BINOMIAL OPTION VALUE TO INCREASE OR DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION CONSIDERS BOTH HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS WELL

AS CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS (EXCLUDING PERFORMANCE RSUS) AND STOCK OPTIONS IS

RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS IS BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE AWARDS ON THE GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR PERFORMANCE RSUS REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITY

THAT THE MARKET AND/OR PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS WILL BE MET AND IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2010, EQUITY-BASED AWARDS PROVIDE CONTINUED VESTING, IN THE EVENT OF TERMINATION, FOR EMPLOYEES THAT REACH

AGE 60 OR GREATER, HAVE AT LEAST TEN YEARS OF SERVICE AND HOLD THE AWARD FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR.

LEGAL MATTERS

CELADOR INTERNATIONAL LTD. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY.

ON MAY 19, 2004, AN AFFILIATE OF THE CREATOR AND LICENSOR OF THE TELEVISION PROGRAM,

WHO WANTS TO BE A

MILLIONAIRE,

FILED AN ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING AMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANIES, INC. AND BUENA VISTA TELEVISION, LLC, ALLEGING IT WAS DAMAGED BY DEFENDANTS IMPROPERLY ENGAGING IN CERTAIN

INTRA-COMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND CHARGING MERCHANDISE DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES, RESULTING IN AN UNDERPAYMENT TO THE PLAINTIFF. ON JULY 7, 2010, THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT AGAINST CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY,

AWARDING PLAINTIFF DAMAGES OF $269.4 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS STIPULATED WITH THE PLAINTIFF TO AN AWARD OF PREJUDGMENT INTEREST OF $50 MILLION, WHICH AMOUNT WILL BE REDUCED PRO RATA SHOULD THE TRIAL COURT OR COURT OF APPEALS REDUCE THE DAMAGES

AMOUNT. IF A NEW TRIAL IS ORDERED THE STIPULATION WILL HAVE NO EFFECT. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS LAWSUIT, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE JURYS VERDICT IS IN ERROR AND HAS MOVED ALTERNATIVELY FOR A NEW TRIAL OR FOR

JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW, AND INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY PURSUE ITS POSITION ON APPEAL IF THOSE MOTIONS ARE UNSUCCESSFUL. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE A PROBABLE LOSS UNDER THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARD RELATING TO PROBABILITY

OF LOSS FOR RECORDING A RESERVE WITH RESPECT TO THIS LITIGATION AND THEREFORE HAS NOT RECORDED A RESERVE.

THE COMPANY,

TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES, CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR CODEFENDANT IN VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS INVOLVING COPYRIGHT, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES.

MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE COMPANY TO SUFFER ANY MATERIAL LIABILITY BY REASON OF THESE ACTIONS.

THE COMPANY HAS A MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS BY COUNTERPARTY WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. CONTRACTS IN A LIABILITY POSITION TOTALING

$206 MILLION HAVE BEEN NETTED AGAINST CONTRACTS IN AN ASSET POSITION IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE

FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO MARKET PRICES BASED ON RECENT TRADING ACTIVITY AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION INCLUDING PRICING FOR SIMILAR SECURITIES AS DETERMINED BY THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES.

THE FAIR VALUES OF LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES, WHICH CONSIST OF INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES, ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED

BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS USING INTERNAL MODELS THAT USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, WHICH IS MITIGATED BY MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND

COLLATERAL POSTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES.

LEVEL 3 RESIDUAL INTERESTS CONSIST OF OUR RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED VACATION OWNERSHIP MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES AND ARE VALUED USING

A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT CONSIDERS ESTIMATED INTEREST RATES, DISCOUNT RATES, PREPAYMENT, AND DEFAULTS. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN FISCAL 2010.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS WHEN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR. DURING FISCAL 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $249 MILLION

ON FILM PRODUCTIONS WHICH ARE REPORTED IN COSTS AND EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE FILM IMPAIRMENT CHARGES COMPARED OUR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE USING DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS A LEVEL 3 INPUT, TO THE UNAMORTIZED COST OF THE FILMS THAT HAD AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUES OF $591 MILLION PRIOR TO THE IMPAIRMENT.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS LISTED ABOVE, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ALSO INCLUDE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND BORROWINGS.

THE FAIR VALUES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS, DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUES. THE ESTIMATED YEAR END FAIR VALUES OF

THE COMPANYS TOTAL BORROWINGS (CURRENT AND NONCURRENT) SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES, DETERMINED BASED ON BROKER QUOTES OR QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR INTEREST RATES FOR THE SAME OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS ARE $13.7 BILLION AND $12.6 BILLION AT

OCTOBER 2, 2010 AND OCTOBER 3, 2009, RESPECTIVELY.

TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

THROUGH DECEMBER 4, 2008, THE COMPANY SOLD MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE SALES OF ITS VACATION OWNERSHIP UNITS UNDER A

FACILITY THAT EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 4, 2008 AND WAS NOT RENEWED. THE COMPANY SOLD $17 MILLION AND $147 MILLION OF MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES DURING THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 3, 2009, AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THESE SALES OF

MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES RESULTED IN GAINS ON SECURITIZED SALES OF VACATION OWNERSHIP INTERESTS TOTALED $4 MILLION AND $32 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 AND FISCAL 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SERVICE THE SOLD RECEIVABLES AND HAS A RESIDUAL INTEREST IN THOSE RECEIVABLES. AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2010, THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT FOR SOLD MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES WAS $309

MILLION AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS RESIDUAL INTEREST, WHICH IS RECORDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS, WAS $54 MILLION.

THE COMPANY REPURCHASES DEFAULTED MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES AT THEIR OUTSTANDING BALANCE. THE COMPANY DID NOT MAKE MATERIAL REPURCHASES IN THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 2, 2010 OR OCTOBER 3, 2009. THE

COMPANY GENERALLY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SELL THE REPURCHASED VACATION OWNERSHIP UNITS FOR AMOUNTS THAT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY WERE REPURCHASED.

THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES CREDIT SUPPORT FOR UP TO 70% OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE SOLD MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES WHICH THE MORTGAGE RECEIVABLE ACQUIRER MAY DRAW ON IN THE EVENT OF LOSSES UNDER THE

FACILITY. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A RESERVE FOR ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO THESE RECEIVABLES.

CREDIT

CONCENTRATIONS

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS WITH, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, THE FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE COUNTERPARTIES TO ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTIES. IN 2008, LEHMAN BROTHERS COMMERCIAL CORPORATION DEFAULTED ON A $91 MILLION TRADE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY IS PURSUING

COLLECTION OF THIS AMOUNT, BUT HAS FULLY RESERVED THE AMOUNT.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT IT WOULD REALIZE A MATERIAL

LOSS, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2010, IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY SINGLE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS ONLY WITH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES THAT

HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF A- OR BETTER. THE COMPANYS CURRENT POLICY REGARDING AGREEMENTS WITH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES IS GENERALLY TO REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A- OR IN THE EVENT AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED

LIMITS AS DEFINED BY CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE MATERIAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF LESS THAN A-. AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2010, THE COMPANYS BALANCES THAT

EXCEEDED 10% OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WERE 30% COMPARED TO 38% AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009.

THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES AND FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AT OCTOBER 2, 2010 DUE TO THE WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS INTO

WHICH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD, THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO AMONG ISSUERS.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS BORROWING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND

CASH FLOWS AND ON THE MARKET VALUE OF ITS BORROWINGS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS ITS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY USES PAY-FLOATING AND

PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO FACILITATE ITS INTEREST RATE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, FIRM COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY HEDGES ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS FOR PERIODS

GENERALLY NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM RANGE OF ANNUAL EXPOSURE. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED FORECASTED TRANSACTION, ASSET, LIABILITY

OR FIRM COMMITMENT. THE PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BORROWINGS INTO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS.

INSTRUMENTS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO POST COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT THAT A NET LIABILITY POSITION WITH A COUNTERPARTY EXCEEDS LIMITS DEFINED BY CONTRACT AND THAT VARY WITH DISNEYS CREDIT RATING. IF THE COMPANYS CREDIT RATINGS WERE TO

FALL BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, SUCH COUNTERPARTIES WOULD HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A NET PAYMENT TO OR FROM THE COMPANY FOR THE AGGREGATE NET VALUE BY COUNTERPARTY OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE

AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WITH CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES THAT ARE IN A NET LIABILITY POSITION BY COUNTERPARTY ON OCTOBER 2, 2010 AND OCTOBER 3, 2009 WERE $306 MILLION AND $125 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.
