TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GROWTH IN THE CABLE/SATELLITE INDUSTRYS

SHARE OF VIEWERS HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES

FOR ADVERTISING REVENUES. THE COMPANYS CABLE/SATELLITE

NETWORKS ALSO FACE COMPETITION FOR CARRIAGE BY CABLE AND

SATELLITE SERVICE OPERATORS AND DISTRIBUTORS. THE COMPANYS

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS ARE

RENEWED OR RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE

OF BUSINESS. CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE

CABLE AND SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND

MAINTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS VARIOUS

CABLE AND SATELLITE PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE

AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE.

THE COMPANYS MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ALSO

COMPETES FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING.

THE MARKET FOR PROGRAMMING IS VERY COMPETITIVE, PARTICULARLY THE

MARKETS FOR SPORTS PROGRAMMING. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS SPORTS

RIGHTS AGREEMENTS WITH THE FOUR MAJOR PROFESSIONAL SPORTS

ORGANIZATIONS  NFL, NBA, MLB AND NHL  AS

WELL AS FOR OTHER SPORTING EVENTS, INCLUDING, THE COLLEGE

FOOTBALL BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES, VARIOUS COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND

BASKETBALL CONFERENCES, THE PGA TOUR, AND THE INDY RACING LEAGUE

INCLUDING THE INDIANAPOLIS 500. THE CURRENT AGREEMENT WITH

THE NFL EXPIRES AFTER THE TELECAST OF THE 2006 PRO BOWL.

EVENTS OF THIS KIND FOR WHICH THE COMPANY SECURES

RIGHTS FROM THIRD PARTIES ARE AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR

PROGRAMMING STRATEGY AND, WHEN COMBINED WITH NEWS AND

INFORMATION AND ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING, ENABLE US TO DELIVER A

FULL COMPLEMENT OF SPORTS ASSETS TO OUR FANS, ADVERTISERS AND

DISTRIBUTORS.

FEDERAL REGULATION

TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY THE FCC UNDER FEDERAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934, AS

AMENDED. VIOLATION OF FCC REGULATIONS CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL

MONETARY FORFEITURES, LIMITED RENEWALS OF LICENSES AND, IN

EGREGIOUS CASES, DENIAL OF LICENSE RENEWAL OR REVOCATION OF A

LICENSE. FCC REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT

INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



LICENSING OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS.

EACH OF THE TELEVISION AND RADIO

STATIONS WE OWN MUST BE LICENSED BY THE FCC. THESE LICENSES ARE

GRANTED FOR PERIODS OF UP TO EIGHT YEARS, AND WE MUST OBTAIN

RENEWAL OF LICENSES AS THEY EXPIRE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE

OPERATING THE STATIONS. WE MUST ALSO OBTAIN FCC APPROVAL

WHENEVER WE SEEK TO HAVE A LICENSE TRANSFERRED IN CONNECTION

WITH THE ACQUISITION OF A STATION. THE FCC MAY DECLINE TO RENEW

OR APPROVE THE TRANSFER OF A LICENSE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE GENERALLY RECEIVED SUCH RENEWALS AND APPROVALS

IN THE PAST, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ALWAYS

OBTAIN NECESSARY RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE FUTURE.



TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP LIMITS.

THE FCC IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE

NUMBER OF TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A

SPECIFIC MARKET, ON THE COMBINED NUMBER OF TELEVISION AND RADIO

STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SINGLE MARKET AND ON THE AGGREGATE

PERCENTAGE OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE THAT CAN BE REACHED BY

TELEVISION STATIONS WE OWN. CURRENTLY.



FCC REGULATIONS PERMIT US TO OWN AN ADDITIONAL

TELEVISION STATION IN ALL OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE HAVE

TELEVISION STATIONS EXCEPT TOLEDO, OHIO, FLINT, MICHIGAN, AND

RALEIGH  DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA. WE DO NOT OWN MORE

THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN ANY OF THE TEN MARKETS IN WHICH

WE OWN A TELEVISION STATION.



FEDERAL STATUTES PERMIT OUR STATIONS IN THE

AGGREGATE TO REACH A MAXIMUM OF 39% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE

(AND FCC REGULATIONS ATTRIBUTE UHF TELEVISION STATIONS WITH ONLY

50% OF THE TELEVISION HOUSEHOLDS IN THEIR MARKET). OUR STATIONS

REACHED APPROXIMATELY 24 PERCENT OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE,

(APPROXIMATELY 23 PERCENT WHEN CALCULATED USING THE

FCCS ATTRIBUTION RULE).

-9-

TABLE OF CONTENTS



FCC REGULATIONS IN SOME CASES IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS

ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL RADIO OR TELEVISION

STATIONS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN RADIO STATIONS, BUT WE

DO NOT BELIEVE ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS ARE MATERIAL TO OUR CURRENT

BUSINESS PLANS.

IN JULY 2003, THE FCC ADOPTED REVISED LIMITS ON

TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP. THE RULES ADOPTED IN

THIS ORDER GENERALLY WOULD RELAX EXISTING OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS

AND WOULD PERMIT ENTITIES TO OWN MORE TELEVISION AND RADIO

STATIONS IN SOME MARKETS, BUT WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE THE 50%

DISCOUNT FOR CALCULATING HOUSEHOLDS REACHED BY UHF TELEVISION

STATIONS OPERATED BY THE TOP FOUR BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS

(INCLUDING ABC). THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE NEW RULES, HOWEVER,

WAS STAYED BY A FEDERAL COURT ORDER, AND THE FCC HAS BEEN

ORDERED TO REVIEW THE RULES. AS A RESULT, MOST OF THE REVISED

RULES ADOPTED BY THE FCC IN JULY 2003 ARE NOT IN EFFECT.

ALTHOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FCC MAY IMPLEMENT MORE LIBERAL

MEDIA OWNERSHIP RULES THAN THOSE CURRENTLY IN EFFECT (OTHER THAN

THOSE GOVERNED BY STATUTE), WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THE

REVISED RULES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND IF SO, WHEN SUCH RULES

WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE.



DUAL NETWORKS.

FCC

RULES CURRENTLY PROHIBIT ANY OF THE FOUR MAJOR TELEVISION

NETWORKS  ABC, CBS, FOX AND NBC  FROM

BEING UNDER COMMON OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL. THE NEW FCC RULES, IF

IMPLEMENTED, WOULD NOT MODIFY THIS LIMITATION.



REGULATION OF PROGRAMMING.

THE FCC REGULATES PROGRAMMING BY,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, BANNING INDECENT PROGRAMMING AND

IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS AND COMMERCIAL TIME LIMITS ON POLITICAL

ADVERTISING. BROADCASTERS FACE A HEIGHTENED RISK OF BEING FOUND

IN VIOLATION OF THE INDECENCY PROHIBITION BECAUSE OF RECENT FCC

DECISIONS, COUPLED WITH THE SPONTANEITY OF LIVE PROGRAMMING.

RECENTLY, THE FCC HAS INDICATED THAT IT IS STEPPING UP

ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AS THEY APPLY TO INDECENCY, AND HAS

INDICATED IT WOULD CONSIDER LICENSE REVOCATION FOR SERIOUS

VIOLATIONS. MOREOVER, LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN

CONGRESS THAT WOULD INCREASE PENALTIES FOR BROADCASTING INDECENT

PROGRAMMING.

FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND FCC RULES ALSO LIMIT THE

AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL MATTER THAT MAY BE SHOWN ON BROADCAST OR

CABLE CHANNELS DURING PROGRAMMING DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN

12 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. IN ADDITION, BROADCAST

CHANNELS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF THREE

HOURS PER WEEK OF PROGRAMMING THAT HAS AS A SIGNIFICANT

PURPOSE MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF

CHILDREN 17 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. FCC RULES ALSO GIVE

TELEVISION STATION OWNERS THE RIGHT TO REJECT OR REFUSE NETWORK

PROGRAMMING IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO SUBSTITUTE

PROGRAMMING THAT THE LICENSEE REASONABLY BELIEVES TO BE OF

GREATER LOCAL OR NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.



CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF BROADCAST

TELEVISION STATIONS.

WITH RESPECT TO

CABLE SYSTEMS OPERATING WITHIN A TELEVISION STATIONS

DESIGNATED MARKET AREA, FCC RULES REQUIRE THAT EVERY THREE YEARS

EACH TELEVISION STATION ELECT EITHER MUST CARRY

STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH CABLE OPERATORS MUST CARRY A LOCAL

TELEVISION STATION IN THE STATIONS MARKET, OR

RETRANSMISSION CONSENT STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE

CABLE OPERATOR IS REQUIRED TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE TELEVISION

STATION TO OBTAIN THE CONSENT OF THE TELEVISION STATION FOR

CARRIAGE OF ITS SIGNAL. UNDER THE SATELLITE HOME IMPROVEMENT

ACT, SATELLITE CARRIERS ARE PERMITTED TO RETRANSMIT A LOCAL

TELEVISION STATIONS SIGNAL INTO ITS LOCAL MARKET WITH THE

CONSENT OF THE LOCAL TELEVISION STATION. IF A SATELLITE CARRIER

ELECTS TO CARRY ONE LOCAL STATION IN A MARKET, THE SATELLITE

CARRIER MUST CARRY THE SIGNALS OF ALL LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS

THAT ALSO REQUEST CARRIAGE. CERTAIN OF THESE SATELLITE CARRIAGE

PROVISIONS ARE SET TO EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 31, 2004; HOWEVER,

CONGRESS IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD EXTEND

THIS TERM TO DECEMBER 31, 2009. WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER

THIS LEGISLATION, OR OTHER SIMILAR LEGISLATION, WILL BECOME LAW.



DIGITAL TELEVISION.

FCC RULES CURRENTLY REQUIRE FULL-POWER

ANALOG TELEVISION STATIONS, SUCH AS OURS, TO PROVIDE DIGITAL

SERVICE ON A SECOND BROADCAST CHANNEL GRANTED SPECIFICALLY FOR

THE PHASE-IN OF DIGITAL BROADCASTING. FCC RULES ALSO REGULATE

DIGITAL BROADCASTING TO ENSURE CONTINUED QUALITY CARRIAGE OF

MANDATED FREE OVER-THE-AIR PROGRAM SERVICE. ALL OF THE COM-

-10-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PANYS STATIONS HAVE LAUNCHED DIGITAL

FACILITIES, AND WE ARE EVALUATING VARIOUS OPTIONS WITH RESPECT

TO USE OF DIGITAL CHANNELS. UNDER CURRENT LAW, ALL BROADCASTERS

ARE REQUIRED TO OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY IN DIGITAL MODE AND

PERMANENTLY SURRENDER ONE OF THEIR TWO CHANNELS BY

DECEMBER 31, 2006. HOWEVER, THE FCC HAS THE AUTHORITY IN

CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO EXTEND THIS DEADLINE IN A PARTICULAR

MARKET UPON THE REQUEST OF A STATION. ON SEPTEMBER 7, 2004,

THE FCC ESTABLISHED INTERMEDIATE DEADLINES BY WHICH STATIONS

MUST PROCEED WITH THE TRANSITION TO DIGITAL, BUT DEFERRED ANY

DETERMINATION AS TO HOW IT WOULD INTERPRET ITS AUTHORITY TO

EXTEND THE DECEMBER 31, 2006 DEADLINE IN A PARTICULAR

MARKET.

THE FOREGOING IS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF CERTAIN

PROVISIONS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND OTHER LEGISLATION AND

OF SPECIFIC FCC RULES AND POLICIES. THIS SUMMARY FOCUSES ON

PROVISIONS MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE TO

THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT, OTHER LEGISLATION, FCC RULES AND PUBLIC

NOTICES AND RULINGS OF THE FCC FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

CONCERNING THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FCCS REGULATORY

AUTHORITY.

FCC LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE,

AND THE COMPANY GENERALLY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER NEW

LEGISLATION, COURT ACTION OR REGULATIONS, OR A CHANGE IN THE

EXTENT OF APPLICATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF CURRENT LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS.

PRICES AND WEATHER PATTERNS.

COMPETITION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

PROTECTION

THE SUCCESS OF STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT OPERATIONS IS

HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON PUBLIC TASTE AND PREFERENCES. IN

ADDITION, STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE DUE

TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL,

HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND TELEVISION MARKETS. RELEASE DATES ARE

DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE

TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS.

THE STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH

ALL FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPANIES

PRODUCE AND/OR DISTRIBUTE THEATRICAL AND TELEVISION FILMS,

EXPLOIT PRODUCTS IN THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET, PROVIDE PAY

TELEVISION PROGRAMMING SERVICES AND SPONSOR LIVE THEATER. WE

ALSO COMPETE TO OBTAIN CREATIVE AND PERFORMING TALENTS, STORY

PROPERTIES, ADVERTISER SUPPORT, BROADCAST RIGHTS AND MARKET

SHARE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR STUDIO

ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO EXPLOIT AND PROTECT

RIGHTS IN ITS CONTENT, INCLUDING ITS MOTION PICTURES, TELEVISION

PROGRAMS AND SOUND RECORDINGS IS AFFECTED BY THE STRENGTH AND

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES

AND ABROAD. INADEQUATE LAWS OR ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO PROTECT

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN A COUNTRY CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, DESPITE THE

COMPANYS STRONG EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN ADDITION, SOME TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, SUCH AS

PEER-TO-PEER TECHNOLOGY AND SOME FEATURES OF DIGITAL VIDEO

RECORDERS, AND OTHER FACTORS HAVE MADE INFRINGEMENT EASIER AND

FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT MORE CHALLENGING. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY

DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO PROTECTING ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY AGAINST PIRACY IN THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN MARKETS.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO

THE RISK OF CHALLENGES BY THIRD PARTIES CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT OF

THEIR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR VALIDITY, SUCH

CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERSION OF

RESOURCES WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

COMPANYS FILM AND TELEVISION PROGRAMS, CONSUMER PRODUCTS

DEVELOPS NEW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WITHIN ITS PUBLISHING AND

INTERACTIVE GAMING DIVISIONS WITH THE POTENTIAL OF BEING

EXPANDED ITS ABILITY TO DESIGN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS ACROSS ALL

CATEGORIES AND CREATE EXCLUSIVE THEMED AND SEASONAL PROMOTIONAL

CAMPAIGNS FOR RETAILERS BASED ON CHARACTERS, MOVIES AND TV

DIRECT MARKETING

THE DIRECT MARKETING BUSINESS OPERATES THE DISNEY

THE COMPANY HAS MARKETED DISNEY-THEMED PRODUCTS

DIRECTLY THROUGH RETAIL FACILITIES OPERATED UNDER THE DISNEY

STORE NAME. THESE FACILITIES ARE GENERALLY LOCATED IN LEADING

SHOPPING MALLS AND OTHER RETAIL COMPLEXES. THE STORES CARRY A

WIDE VARIETY OF DISNEY MERCHANDISE AND PROMOTE OTHER BUSINESSES

OF THE COMPANY. THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OWNED AND OPERATED STORES

COMPETITION, SEASONALITY, AND INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY PROTECTION

THE COMPANY COMPETES IN ITS CHARACTER

MERCHANDISING AND OTHER LICENSING, PUBLISHING, INTERACTIVE AND

RETAIL ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER LICENSORS, PUBLISHERS AND RETAILERS

OF CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES. ALTHOUGH PUBLIC

INFORMATION IS LIMITED, WE BELIEVE THE COMPANY IS THE LARGEST

WORLDWIDE LICENSOR OF CHARACTER-BASED MERCHANDISE AND

PRODUCER/DISTRIBUTOR OF CHILDRENS FILM-RELATED PRODUCTS

BASED ON RETAIL SALES. OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE LICENSING AND

RETAIL DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER

PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF

ANIMATED THEATRICAL RELEASES.

THE COMPANYS LICENSING BUSINESSES, AS WELL

AS ITS STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT AND THEME PARK AND RESORT

OPERATIONS, ARE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

EXPLOIT AND PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING

TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS AND TRADE SECRETS,

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AS A RESULT, DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LAWS

PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE IMPORTANT TO THE

COMPANY. THE RIGHT AND ABILITY TO ENFORCE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS AGAINST INFRINGEMENT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANYS

BUSINESSES. THESE BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF

CHALLENGES BY THIRD PARTIES CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT OF THEIR

PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR VALIDITY, SUCH CLAIMS

MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERSION OF RESOURCES WHICH

COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS LICENSING

OPERATIONS.

SSI LEAVE TO AMEND ITS ANSWER TO ASSERT COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST

DISMISSAL AGAINST IT, SO AS TO PERMIT ITS APPEAL

TO THE COURT OF APPEALS TO PROCEED, AND THE DISTRICT COURT

GRANTED THAT MOTION BY ORDER DATED NOVEMBER 12, 2004.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT CURRENTLY

POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT IF ANY, THAT THE ULTIMATE

RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES,

CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR

CO-DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS INVOLVING COPYRIGHT,

BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE

CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE

COMPANY TO SUFFER ANY MATERIAL LIABILITY BY REASON OF SUCH

ACTIONS.

SEC PROCEEDING.

THE

U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (THE SEC) IS

CONDUCTING AN INVESTIGATION INTO AN AMENDMENT OF THE

COMPANYS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K FOR FISCAL YEAR

2001, CERTAIN RELATED MATTERS AND OTHER RELATED PARTY

TRANSACTIONS THAT HAVE BEEN PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED BY THE COMPANY.

THE INVESTIGATION DOES NOT RELATE TO THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT RATHER TO THE ISSUE OF DISCLOSURE OF

THOSE RELATIONSHIPS. THE COMPANY IS IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE

STAFF OF THE SEC ABOUT A POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE RESOLUTION OF

THESE NON-FINANCIAL MATTERS, WHICH WOULD ALLEGE DISCLOSURE

DEFICIENCIES GENERALLY ABOUT THESE MATTERS AND CITE VIOLATION

UNDER SECTIONS 13(A) AND 14(A) OF THE EXCHANGE ACT

REGARDING THE FOLLOWING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND

CERTAIN DIRECTORS: THE EMPLOYMENT OF ADULT CHILDREN OF THREE

DIRECTORS BY THE COMPANY AND THE WIFE OF ANOTHER DIRECTOR BY A

50% OWNED JOINT VENTURE (WHOSE EMPLOYMENT PRECEDED THE

DIRECTORS TENURE); THE PROVISION OF AN OFFICE, SECRETARY

AND DRIVER TO ONE DIRECTOR FOLLOWING HIS RETIREMENT AS CHIEF

EXECUTIVE OFFICER OF CAPITAL/ CITIES ABC, INC.; AND THE PAYMENTS

TO AIR SHAMROCK, INC., A COMPANY CONTROLLED BY A FORMER

DIRECTOR, IN REIMBURSEMENT FOR HIS BUSINESS USE OF HIS PRIVATE

CORPORATE JET. THE SETTLEMENT UNDER DISCUSSION WOULD INVOLVE THE

ISSUANCE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE CEASE AND DESIST ORDER.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

2004 VS. 2003

NET INCOME FOR THE YEAR WAS $2.3 BILLION,

WHICH WAS $1.1 BILLION HIGHER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE

INCREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THE YEAR WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

IMPROVEMENTS IN SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME IN ALL OF THE OPERATING

SEGMENTS (SEE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS BELOW FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION). DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE YEAR WERE $1.12,

AN INCREASE OF $0.47 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS PER

SHARE OF $0.65 BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF AN ACCOUNTING

CHANGE. RESULTS FOR THE YEAR INCLUDED A BENEFIT IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER FROM THE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN INCOME TAX ISSUES OF

$120 MILLION ($0.06 PER SHARE) AND RESTRUCTURING AND

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TOTALING $64 MILLION ($0.02 PER SHARE)

IN CONNECTION WITH THE SALE OF THE DISNEY STORES IN NORTH

AMERICA, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH WERE RECORDED IN THE THIRD

QUARTER.

RESULTS FOR THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED A

$114 MILLION ($0.04 PER SHARE) WRITE-OFF OF AN AIRCRAFT

LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT DURING THE FIRST QUARTER AND THE

FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN INCOME TAX ISSUES OF

$56 MILLION ($0.03 PER SHARE) IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.

ADDITIONALLY, WE MADE AN ACCOUNTING CHANGE EFFECTIVE AS OF THE

BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2003 TO ADOPT A NEW ACCOUNTING RULE FOR

MULTIPLE ELEMENT REVENUE ACCOUNTING (EITF 00-21, SEE

NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) WHICH

RESULTED IN AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $71 MILLION FOR THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

INCLUDING THIS CUMULATIVE EFFECT WERE $0.62 FOR THE PRIOR YEAR.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS HAS ALLOWED US TO

CONTINUE TO MAKE NECESSARY CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR PROPERTIES

AND TO REDUCE OUR BORROWINGS, WHICH IN TURN IS REDUCING OUR

INTEREST EXPENSE. DURING THE YEAR, WE GENERATED CASH FLOW FROM

OPERATIONS OF $4.4 BILLION AND HAD NET REPAYMENT OF

BORROWINGS OF $2.2 BILLION. AS A RESULT OF OUR ADOPTION OF

FIN 46R, WE CONSOLIDATED THE BALANCE SHEETS OF EURO DISNEY

AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND AS OF MARCH 31, 2004 AND ADDED

THEIR BORROWINGS ($2.2 BILLION FOR EURO DISNEY AND

$545 MILLION FOR HONG KONG DISNEYLAND AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004) TO OUR BALANCE SHEET, AS WELL AS THEIR

ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES. ACCORDINGLY, OUR TOTAL BORROWINGS

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 INCREASED TO $13.5 BILLION. WE

ALSO USED CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS TO REPURCHASE

$335 MILLION OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.

2003 VS. 2002

INCOME BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF AN

ACCOUNTING CHANGE WAS $1.3 BILLION IN FISCAL 2003, WHICH

WAS $102 MILLION, OR 8%, HIGHER THAN IN FISCAL 2002. THIS

REPRESENTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE OF $0.65, WHICH WAS $0.05 HIGHER

THAN IN FISCAL 2002. WE MADE AN ACCOUNTING CHANGE EFFECTIVE AS

OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2003 TO ADOPT A NEW ACCOUNTING RULE

FOR MULTIPLE ELEMENT REVENUE ACCOUNTING

(EITF 00-21, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS), WHICH IMPACTED THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION

RELATED TO NFL FOOTBALL PROGRAMMING AT ESPN. THIS CHANGE

RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE EFFECT CHARGE TOTALING

$71 MILLION. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCLUDING THE

EFFECT OF THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE WERE $0.62 FOR FISCAL 2003.

RESULTS FOR 2003 ALSO INCLUDED A WRITE-OFF OF AN

AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT WITH UNITED AIRLINES

($114 MILLION PRE-TAX OR $0.04 PER SHARE), A PRE-TAX GAIN

OF $16 MILLION ON THE SALE OF THE ANAHEIM ANGELS AND

RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $16 MILLION AT THE

DISNEY STORE. ADDITIONALLY, FISCAL 2003 INCLUDED A BENEFIT FROM

THE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN STATE TAX ISSUES

($56 MILLION OR $0.03 PER SHARE). RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2002

REVENUES

MEDIA NETWORKS REVENUES INCREASED 8%, OR

$837 MILLION, TO $11.8 BILLION REFLECTING A 16%

INCREASE, OR $887 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS, AND A

DECREASE OF 1%, OR $50 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING.

INCREASED CABLE NETWORKS REVENUES WERE DRIVEN BY

INCREASES OF $696 MILLION IN REVENUES FROM CABLE AND

SATELLITE OPERATORS AND $236 MILLION IN ADVERTISING

REVENUES. INCREASED ADVERTISING REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT

OF THE INCREASES AT ESPN DUE TO HIGHER ADVERTISING RATES AND AT

ABC FAMILY DUE TO HIGHER RATINGS. REVENUES FROM CABLE AND

SATELLITE OPERATORS ARE LARGELY DERIVED FROM FEES CHARGED ON A

PER SUBSCRIBER BASIS, AND THE INCREASES IN THE CURRENT YEAR

REFLECTED BOTH CONTRACTUAL RATE ADJUSTMENTS AND TO A LESSER

EXTENT SUBSCRIBER GROWTH. THE COMPANYS CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS WITH CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS ARE RENEWED OR

RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE UP

FOR RENEWAL IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. CONSOLIDATION IN THE

CABLE AND SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND

MAINTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS VARIOUS

CABLE AND SATELLITE PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE

AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR, REVENUES

FROM CABLE NETWORKS COULD INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN IN THE

PAST OR COULD BE STABLE OR DECLINE.

DECREASED BROADCASTING REVENUES WERE DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY A DECREASE OF $147 MILLION AT THE ABC

TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $63 MILLION AT THE ABC TELEVISION

NETWORK. THE DECREASE IN TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION

REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SYNDICATION REVENUE AND

LICENSE FEES. THE INCREASE AT THE NETWORK WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER

ADVERTISING REVENUES REFLECTING HIGHER RATES DUE TO AN IMPROVED

ADVERTISING MARKETPLACE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RATINGS AND A

DECREASE DUE TO AIRING THE SUPER BOWL IN FISCAL 2003.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES CONSIST PRIMARILY OF

PROGRAMMING RIGHTS AMORTIZATION, PRODUCTION COSTS, DISTRIBUTION

AND SELLING EXPENSES AND LABOR COSTS. COSTS AND EXPENSES

DECREASED 1%, OR $119 MILLION, TO $9.6 BILLION. THE

DECREASE REFLECTED LOWER COSTS AT BROADCASTING, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY HIGHER COSTS AT CABLE. THE DECREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DUE

TO LOWER PROGRAMMING COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PENSION

AND OTHER ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS WELL AS HIGHER MOVIEBEAM

COSTS. HIGHER COSTS AT CABLE REFLECTED INCREASED PROGRAMMING,

PENSION AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER BAD

DEBT EXPENSE.

-32-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOWER PROGRAMMING COSTS AT BROADCASTING WERE

DRIVEN BY LOWER SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS DUE PRIMARILY TO THE

AIRING OF THE SUPER BOWL IN THE PRIOR-YEAR, LOWER LICENSE FEES

FOR PRIMETIME SERIES AND FEWER PRIMETIME MOVIES. ADDITIONALLY,

THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED HIGHER NEWS PRODUCTION COSTS DUE TO THE

COVERAGE OF THE MILITARY CONFLICT IN IRAQ.

HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS AT THE CABLE NETWORKS

WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RIGHTS AND PRODUCTION COSTS AT

ESPN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NFL AMORTIZATION DUE TO

COMMENCING THE THREE YEAR OPTION PERIOD AS DESCRIBED UNDER

SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS BELOW. THE DECREASE IN BAD

DEBT EXPENSE AT THE CABLE NETWORKS REFLECTED THE FAVORABLE

IMPACT OF A BANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT WITH A CABLE OPERATOR IN LATIN

AMERICA IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF THE CURRENT YEAR.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 79%, OR

$956 MILLION, TO $2.2 BILLION REFLECTING INCREASES OF

$748 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND $208 MILLION AT

BROADCASTING. GROWTH AT THE CABLE NETWORKS REFLECTED HIGHER

AFFILIATE REVENUES, HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUE AND LOWER NFL

PROGRAMMING COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RIGHTS AND

PRODUCTION COST AND HIGHER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. INCREASED

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AT BROADCASTING REFLECTED HIGHER

ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND LOWER

PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS

THE INITIAL FIVE-YEAR PERIOD OF THE

COMPANYS CONTRACT TO TELEVISE NFL GAMES WAS NON-CANCELABLE

AND ENDED WITH THE TELECAST OF THE 2003 PRO BOWL. IN FEBRUARY

2003, THE NFL DID NOT EXERCISE ITS RENEGOTIATION OPTION AND AS A

RESULT, THE COMPANYS NFL CONTRACT WAS EXTENDED FOR AN

ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS ENDING WITH THE TELECAST OF THE 2006 PRO

BOWL. THE AGGREGATE FEE FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD IS

$3.7 BILLION. ESPN RECOGNIZED ITS PORTION OF THE COSTS OF

THE INITIAL FIVE-YEAR TERM OF THE CONTRACT AT LEVELS THAT

INCREASED EACH YEAR COMMENSURATE WITH EXPECTED INCREASES IN NFL

REVENUES. AS A RESULT, ESPN EXPERIENCED ITS HIGHEST LEVEL OF NFL

PROGRAMMING COSTS DURING FISCAL 2003. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE

CONTRACT EXTENSION RESULTED IN A $180 MILLION REDUCTION IN

NFL PROGRAMMING COSTS AT ESPN IN FISCAL 2004 AS COMPARED TO

FISCAL 2003. THE MAJORITY OF THIS DECREASE WAS IN THE FIRST

QUARTER. THESE COSTS WILL BE RELATIVELY LEVEL OVER THE REMAINING

TWO YEARS OF THE CONTRACT EXTENSION.

COST RECOGNITION FOR NFL PROGRAMMING AT THE ABC

TELEVISION NETWORK IN FISCAL 2004 DECREASED BY $300 MILLION

AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003. THE DECREASE AT THE ABC TELEVISION

NETWORK IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF THE SUPER BOWL, WHICH

WAS AIRED BY THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK IN FISCAL 2003, AS WELL

AS FEWER GAMES IN FISCAL 2004. THE ABSENCE OF THE SUPER BOWL AND

THE LOWER NUMBER OF GAMES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK ALSO

RESULTED IN LOWER REVENUE FROM NFL BROADCASTS IN FISCAL 2004.

DUE TO THE PAYMENT TERMS IN THE NFL CONTRACT,

CASH PAYMENTS UNDER THE CONTRACT IN FISCAL 2004 TOTALED

$1.2 BILLION AS COMPARED TO $1.3 BILLION IN FISCAL

2003.

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS

FOR THE PURCHASE OF TELEVISION RIGHTS FOR SPORTS AND OTHER

PROGRAMMING, INCLUDING THE NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL AND VARIOUS

COLLEGE FOOTBALL CONFERENCE AND BOWL GAMES. THE COSTS OF THESE

CONTRACTS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. WE ENTER

INTO THESE CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT,

OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACTS, REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING DURING

THE PROGRAMMING AND AFFILIATE FEES WILL EXCEED THE COSTS OF THE

PROGRAMMING. WHILE CONTRACT COSTS MAY INITIALLY EXCEED

INCREMENTAL REVENUES AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OPERATING INCOME, IT

IS OUR EXPECTATION THAT THE COMBINED VALUE TO OUR SPORTS

NETWORKS FROM ALL OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL RESULT IN LONG-TERM

BENEFITS. THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THESE CONTRACTS ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS IS

DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF

ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE

SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES.

PARKS AND RESORTS  2004 VS.

2003

REVENUES

REVENUES AT PARKS AND RESORTS INCREASED 21%, OR

$1.3 BILLION, TO $7.8 BILLION. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY

INCREASES OF $715 MILLION DUE TO THE CONSOLIDATION,

EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2004, OF EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG

DISNEYLAND (PRIMARILY EURO DISNEY), $609 MILLION FROM THE

WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT, AND $95 MILLION FROM THE

DISNEYLAND RESORT. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

DECREASE OF $61 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF THE

ANAHEIM ANGELS BASEBALL TEAM DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL

2003.

AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT, INCREASED

REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER THEME PARK ATTENDANCE,

OCCUPIED ROOM NIGHTS, AND PER CAPITA SPENDING AT THE THEME

PARKS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PER ROOM GUEST SPENDING AT THE

HOTELS. HIGHER THEME PARK ATTENDANCE WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED

RESIDENT, DOMESTIC, AND INTERNATIONAL GUEST VISITATION,

REFLECTING THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF MISSION: SPACE,

MICKEYS PHILHARMAGIC AND DISNEYS POP CENTURY RESORT,

AND IMPROVEMENTS IN TRAVEL AND TOURISM. GUEST SPENDING DECREASES

AT THE HOTELS REFLECTED A HIGHER MIX OF HOTEL GUEST VISITATION

AT THE LOWER PRICED VALUE RESORTS.

AT THE DISNEYLAND RESORT, INCREASED REVENUES WERE

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER GUEST SPENDING AT THE THEME PARKS AND

HOTEL PROPERTIES.

ACROSS OUR DOMESTIC THEME PARKS, ATTENDANCE

INCREASED 7% AND PER CAPITA GUEST SPENDING INCREASED 6% COMPARED

TO THE PRIOR YEAR. ATTENDANCE AND PER CAPITA GUEST SPENDING AT

THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT INCREASED 10% AND 4%, RESPECTIVELY.

$2.5 BILLION, REFLECTING INCREASES OF $73 MILLION IN

MERCHANDISE LICENSING, $72 MILLION IN PUBLISHING AND

$28 MILLION AT THE DISNEY STORES.

HIGHER MERCHANDISE LICENSING REVENUES WERE DUE TO

HIGHER SALES OF HARDLINES, SOFTLINES AND TOYS WHICH WERE DRIVEN

BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

DISNEY PRINCESS

AND CERTAIN

FILM PROPERTIES. THE INCREASE AT PUBLISHING PRIMARILY REFLECTED

THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

FINDING NEMO

AND OTHER

ACROSS ALL REGIONS.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OVERALL COSTS AND EXPENSES WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT

ON NOVEMBER 21, 2004, THE COMPANY SOLD

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DISNEY STORE CHAIN IN NORTH AMERICA

UNDER A LONG-TERM LICENSING ARRANGEMENT TO A WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF THE CHILDRENS PLACE (TCP).

PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE SALE, THE DISNEY STORE NORTH

AMERICA WILL RETAIN ITS LEASE OBLIGATIONS AND WILL BECOME A

WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TCP. TCP WILL PAY THE COMPANY A

ROYALTY ON THE PHYSICAL RETAIL STORE SALES BEGINNING ON THE

SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE OF THE SALE.

DURING THE YEAR, THE COMPANY RECORDED

$64 MILLION OF RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED

TO THE DISNEY STORE. THE BULK OF THE CHARGE ($50 MILLION) WAS AN

IMPAIRMENT OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE FIXED ASSETS RELATED TO

THE STORES TO BE SOLD WHICH WAS RECORDED IN THE THIRD QUARTER

BASED ON THE TERMS OF SALE. ADDITIONAL CHARGES RECORDED DURING

THE YEAR RELATED TO THE CLOSURE OF STORES THAT WOULD NOT BE SOLD

AND TO TRANSACTION COSTS RELATED TO THE SALE.

THE COMPANY WILL RECORD ADDITIONAL CHARGES FOR

WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE CLOSE OF

THIS TRANSACTION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005.

ADDITIONAL RESTRUCTURING COSTS WILL ALSO BE RECOGNIZED LATER IN

2004 VS 2003

EXCLUDING AN INCREASE OF $51 MILLION DUE TO

THE CONSOLIDATION OF EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND FOR

THE YEAR, INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED $88 MILLION (OR 13%) FOR

THE YEAR. LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO LOWER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES.

INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME (LOSS) WAS

INCOME OF $28 MILLION COMPARED TO A LOSS OF

$13 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT YEAR REFLECTED

HIGHER INTEREST INCOME WHILE THE PRIOR YEAR PERIOD INCLUDED A

LOSS ON THE EARLY REPAYMENT OF CERTAIN BORROWINGS.

EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF

INVESTEES

2004 VS 2003

THE INCREASE IN EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF OUR

INVESTEES REFLECTED INCREASES AT LIFETIME TELEVISION, DUE TO

LOWER PROGRAMMING AND MARKETING EXPENSES, AS WELL AS INCREASES

AT A&E AND E! ENTERTAINMENT DUE TO HIGHER ADVERTISING

REVENUES.

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

2004 VS 2003

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED FROM

35.0% IN FISCAL 2003 TO 32.0% IN FISCAL 2004. THE DECREASE IN

THE FISCAL 2004 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO

TAX RESERVE ADJUSTMENTS INCLUDING A $120 MILLION RESERVE

RELEASE AS A RESULT OF THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN

FEDERAL INCOME TAX ISSUES. AS MORE FULLY DISCLOSED IN NOTE 7 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE FISCAL 2004 EFFECTIVE

INCOME TAX RATE REFLECTS A $97 MILLION BENEFIT FOR CERTAIN

INCOME EXCLUSIONS PROVIDED FOR UNDER U.S. INCOME TAX LAWS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THIS EXCLUSION HAS BEEN REPEALED AND WILL BE PHASED

OUT COMMENCING FISCAL 2005.

PENSION AND BENEFIT COSTS

INCREASING PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL

BENEFIT PLAN COSTS HAVE AFFECTED RESULTS IN ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS,

WITH THE MAJORITY OF THESE COSTS BEING BORNE BY THE PARKS AND

RESORTS SEGMENT. THE COSTS INCREASED FROM $131 MILLION IN

FISCAL 2003 TO $374 MILLION IN FISCAL 2004. THE INCREASE IN

FISCAL 2004 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO DECREASES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE

TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS, THE EXPECTED

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE OF PLAN ASSETS.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION DECREASED FROM 7.20% TO 5.85%

REFLECTING THE DECLINE IN OVERALL MARKET INTEREST RATES AND THE

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS REDUCED FROM 8.5% TO 7.5%

REFLECTING TRENDS IN THE OVERALL FINANCIAL MARKETS.

WE EXPECT PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL

COSTS TO DECREASE IN FISCAL 2005 TO $315 MILLION. THE

DECREASE IS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE

ASSUMPTION FROM 5.85% TO 6.30%, REFLECTING INCREASES IN

PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES.

CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLANS ARE EXPECTED TO

DECREASE IN FISCAL 2005 TO APPROXIMATELY $165 MILLION FROM

$173 MILLION IN FISCAL 2004.

DUE TO PLAN ASSET PERFORMANCE AND AN INCREASE IN

THE PRESENT VALUE OF PENSION OBLIGATIONS, PENSION OBLIGATIONS

LIABILITY IN FISCAL 2004 WAS DUE TO THE INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT

RATE FROM 5.85% TO 6.30% AND IMPROVED PLAN ASSET PERFORMANCE.

THE ACCOUNTING RULES DO NOT REQUIRE THAT CHANGES IN THE

ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT BE RECORDED IN

CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS BUT RATHER ARE TO BE RECORDED DIRECTLY

TO EQUITY THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

EXPENSE RECOGNITION UNDER THE PENSION ACCOUNTING RULES IS BASED

UPON LONG-TERM TRENDS OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE

COMPANYS WORKFORCE. SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

REVENUES

MEDIA NETWORKS REVENUES INCREASED 12%, OR

$1.2 BILLION, TO $10.9 BILLION REFLECTING INCREASES OF

18%, OR $848 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND 7%, OR

$360 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING.

INCREASED CABLE NETWORKS REVENUES WERE DRIVEN BY

INCREASES OF $455 MILLION IN REVENUES FROM CABLE AND

SATELLITE OPERATORS AND $385 MILLION IN ADVERTISING

REVENUES. INCREASED ADVERTISING REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT

OF THE ADDITION OF NBA GAMES. REVENUES FROM CABLE AND SATELLITE

OPERATORS INCREASED DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE ADJUSTMENTS AND

SUBSCRIBER GROWTH.

INCREASED BROADCASTING REVENUES WERE DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE OF $196 MILLION AT THE ABC

TELEVISION NETWORK, $60 MILLION AT THE COMPANYS OWNED

AND OPERATED TELEVISION STATIONS AND $33 MILLION AT THE

RADIO NETWORKS AND STATIONS. THE INCREASES AT THE TELEVISION

NETWORK AND STATIONS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER ADVERTISING

REVENUES REFLECTING HIGHER RATES DUE TO AN IMPROVED ADVERTISING

MARKETPLACE. THE AIRING OF THE SUPER BOWL IN THE SECOND QUARTER

OF FISCAL 2003 ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED ADVERTISING

REVENUES. REVENUES AT THE RADIO NETWORKS AND STATIONS ALSO

INCREASED DUE TO THE STRONGER ADVERTISING MARKET.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES INCREASED 11%, OR

$981 MILLION OVER FISCAL 2002 DUE TO HIGHER PROGRAMMING AND

PRODUCTION COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER BAD DEBT EXPENSE AT

THE CABLE NETWORKS. ADDITIONALLY, FISCAL 2002 BENEFITED FROM THE

RECEIPT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS RELATED TO THE LOSS OF A BROADCAST

TOWER.

HIGHER PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS AT THE

ABC TELEVISION NETWORK WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE AIRING OF THE

SUPER BOWL AND THE COSTS OF COVERAGE OF THE WAR IN IRAQ. HIGHER

PROGRAMMING COSTS AT THE CABLE NETWORKS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO

NBA AND MLB TELECASTS AND HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS AT ABC

FAMILY. PROGRAMMING COST INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

LOWER COST AMORTIZATION FOR THE NFL CONTRACT DUE TO COMMENCING

THE THREE YEAR OPTION PERIOD AS DESCRIBED UNDER SPORTS

PROGRAMMING COSTS ABOVE. THE DECREASE IN BAD DEBT EXPENSE

AT CABLE NETWORKS REFLECTED NEGATIVE IMPACTS IN FISCAL 2002

RELATED TO FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OF ADELPHIA COMMUNICATIONS

COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES AND KIRCHMEDIA & COMPANY IN

GERMANY.

FROM THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT. THESE DECREASES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $83 MILLION AT THE

DISNEYLAND RESORT. THE DECREASE IN REVENUES FROM EURO DISNEY

REFLECTED THE CESSATION OF BILLING AND RECOGNITION OF REVENUES

FROM ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES COMMENCING WITH THE SECOND

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003 DUE TO EURO DISNEYS FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTIES.

REVENUES AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT WERE

DOWN MARGINALLY, REFLECTING LOWER THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND

HOTEL OCCUPANCY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PER CAPITA GUEST

SPENDING AT THE THEME PARKS AND HOTEL PROPERTIES. DECREASED

GUEST SPENDING INCREASES REFLECTED TICKET PRICE INCREASES DURING

FISCAL 2003.

AT THE DISNEYLAND RESORT, INCREASED REVENUES WERE

DRIVEN BY HIGHER THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND HOTEL OCCUPANCY.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO ISSUE UP TO

$500 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THIS FACILITY,

IN CONJUNCTION WITH TERM DEBT ISSUANCE AND OPERATING CASH FLOW,

TO RETIRE OR REFINANCE OTHER BORROWINGS BEFORE OR AS THEY COME

DUE.

EUROPEAN MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM, WHICH PERMITS

ISSUANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS,

THE COMPANY DECLARED AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF $0.24

EURO DISNEY IS CURRENTLY IN THE PROCESS OF A

FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING, THAT IF COMPLETED, WILL RESULT IN A

REFINANCING OF ITS DEBT. SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THE TERMS OF THE

RESTRUCTURING.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH BALANCES, OTHER LIQUID

ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL

MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE

RESOURCES TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING

BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE

COMPANYS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL

MARKETS CAN BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS

CONTROL. IN ADDITION TO MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE

COMPANYS BORROWING COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT AND

LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES,

WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS

PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CERTAIN CREDIT MEASURES SUCH AS

INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2004, MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES LONG AND SHORT-TERM

DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE BAAL AND P-2, RESPECTIVELY,

WITH STABLE OUTLOOK; AND STANDARD & POORS LONG AND

SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE BBB+ AND A-2,

RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK. THE COMPANYS BANK

FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT, RELATING TO

INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE COMPANY MET ON SEPTEMBER 30,

2004, BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. THE COMPANYS BANK

FACILITIES ALSO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE CERTAIN ENTITIES, INCLUDING

EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND, FROM ANY REPRESENTATIONS,

COVENANTS OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF

BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

WHICH ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. OTHER ITEMS, SUCH AS CERTAIN PURCHASE COMMITMENTS

AND OTHER EXECUTORY CONTRACTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES

IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT ARE REQUIRED TO BE

DISCLOSED. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED

TO ACQUIRE BROADCAST PROGRAMMING AND MAKE CERTAIN MINIMUM LEASE

PAYMENTS FOR THE USE OF PROPERTY UNDER OPERATING LEASE

AGREEMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EURO DISNEY

AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF

AGREEMENT (MOA) WITH RESPECT TO THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING

OF EURO DISNEY THAT REMAINS SUBJECT TO CERTAIN APPROVALS BY EURO

DISNEYS SHAREHOLDERS (WHICH THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO VOTE

IN FAVOR OF), COMPLETION OF FINAL DOCUMENTATION, AND SUCCESSFUL

IMPLEMENTATION OF AN EQUITY RIGHTS OFFERING BY NO LATER THAN

MARCH 31, 2005. IF APPROVED, THE MOA WOULD COMMIT THE

COMPANY TO MAKE CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN AND ADVANCES TO EURO

DISNEY. IN ADDITION, THE TIMING OF EURO DISNEYS FUTURE

PAYMENTS TO ITS LENDERS WILL CHANGE AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4.

AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT

AS DISCLOSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 4 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2004, THE COMPANYS REMAINING NET AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASE

INVESTMENT TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $156 MILLION, CONSISTING

OF $101 MILLION AND $55 MILLION WITH DELTA AIR LINES,

INC. (DELTA) AND FEDEX, RESPECTIVELY. GIVEN THE CURRENT STATUS

OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE

RECOVERABILITY OF THESE INVESTMENTS, PARTICULARLY THE DELTA

LEASES. DELTA HAS DISCLOSED THAT IF IT IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN

REDUCING ITS OPERATING EXPENSES AND CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE

SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, IT WILL NEED TO SEEK TO RESTRUCTURE ITS

COSTS UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE.

ALTHOUGH DELTA REMAINS CURRENT ON THEIR LEASE PAYMENTS TO US,

THE INABILITY OF DELTA TO MAKE THEIR LEASE PAYMENTS, OR THE

TERMINATION OF OUR LEASE IN A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING, COULD

RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHARGE FOR THE WRITE-DOWN OF OUR INVESTMENT

AND COULD ACCELERATE CERTAIN INCOME TAX PAYMENTS.

LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS

AS DISCLOSED IN NOTES 7 AND 13 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR

CERTAIN LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL

POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT. FOR A SUMMARY

OF ALL OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING

POLICIES DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND

COSTS

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF FILM AND TELEVISION

PRODUCTION AND PARTICIPATIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN MULTI-YEAR

SPORTS RIGHTS OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON

THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO THE

ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS REVENUES OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. THESE ESTIMATES ARE CALCULATED ON AN

INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION BASIS FOR FILM AND TELEVISION AND ON AN

INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT BASIS FOR SPORTS RIGHTS. ESTIMATES OF TOTAL

GROSS REVENUES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO A VARIETY OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING ADVERTISING RATES AND THE LEVEL OF MARKET

ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCTION.

FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ESTIMATED REMAINING GROSS

REVENUE FROM ALL SOURCES INCLUDES REVENUE THAT WILL BE EARNED

WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE.

FOR TELEVISION SERIES, WE INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED

WITHIN 10 YEARS OF THE DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF

STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY OF THE

MOST RECENT EPISODE. FOR ACQUIRED FILM LIBRARIES, REMAINING

REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO BE EARNED FOR UP TO 20 YEARS

FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.

TELEVISION NETWORK AND STATION RIGHTS FOR

THEATRICAL MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS ARE CHARGED TO

EXPENSE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO

BE SHOWN. ESTIMATES OF USAGE OF TELEVISION NETWORK AND STATION

PROGRAMMING CAN CHANGE BASED ON COMPETITION AND AUDIENCE

ACCEPTANCE. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE ESTIMATES AND PLANNED USAGE ARE

REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND ARE REVISED IF NECESSARY. A CHANGE IN

REVENUE PROJECTIONS OR PLANNED USAGE COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

-48-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND

PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR OUR TELEVISION AND CABLE NETWORKS ARE

SUBJECT TO VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE

ACCOUNTING RULES. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE TELEVISION

BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A

DAYPART METHODOLOGY. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE: EARLY

MORNING, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN AND

SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN

AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF

DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF

OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR

EACH CABLE CHANNEL. ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS

ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL DEMAND OR

MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR PROJECTIONS, FILM

AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ASSET WRITE-DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR

ITS VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE

CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH BUSINESS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THESE REVENUE RECOGNITION

POLICIES.

WE RECORD REDUCTIONS TO REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED

FUTURE RETURNS OF MERCHANDISE, PRIMARILY HOME VIDEO, DVD AND

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, AND FOR CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND SALES

INCENTIVES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL RETURN

EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS OF CUSTOMER

DEMAND FOR AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE

THE LEVEL OF RETURNS IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD, WE MAY RECORD LESS

REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS EXCEED THE PREDICTED

AMOUNT. CONVERSELY, IF WE OVERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS FOR

A PERIOD, WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN

RETURNS ARE LESS THAN PREDICTED.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

THE COMPANYS PENSION BENEFIT AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE

CALCULATED USING ACTUARIAL CONCEPTS, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 87

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS

(SFAS 87) AND

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 106,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER

THAN PENSIONS

(SFAS 106), RESPECTIVELY. TWO CRITICAL

ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY

MEASUREMENT. WE EVALUATE THESE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ANNUALLY.

OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVE EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS

RETIREMENT PATTERNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER AND THE RATE OF

COMPENSATION INCREASE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED

FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS AS A PRESENT VALUE ON THE MEASUREMENT

DATE. THE GUIDELINE FOR SETTING THIS RATE IS A HIGH-QUALITY

LONG-TERM CORPORATE BOND RATE. A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE INCREASES

THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES PENSION

EXPENSE. WE INCREASED OUR DISCOUNT RATE TO 6.30% IN 2004 FROM

5.85% IN 2003 TO REFLECT MARKET INTEREST RATE CONDITIONS. A ONE

PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD

INCREASE ANNUAL EXPENSE AND THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY

$31 MILLION AND $620 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A ONE

PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD

DECREASE ANNUAL EXPENSE AND PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS BY

$29 MILLION AND $515 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED

ASSET ALLOCATION, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON

EACH PLAN ASSET CLASS. A LOWER EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON

PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE. OUR LONG-TERM

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.50% IN BOTH 2004 AND 2003,

RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN THE LONG-TERM

RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSET ASSUMPTION WOULD IMPACT ANNUAL

PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $29 MILLION. SEE NOTE 8 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-LIVED ASSETS

AND INVESTMENTS

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2001, WE ADOPTED

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(SFAS 142). GOODWILL

AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS MUST BE TESTED

-49-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. WE COMPLETED

OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND

DETERMINED THAT THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RELATED TO

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ASSESSING THE

RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MARKET

VALUES AND PROJECTIONS REGARDING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND

OTHER FACTORS ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

RESPECTIVE ASSETS. IF THESE ESTIMATES OR RELATED PROJECTIONS

CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES FOR THESE ASSETS.

FOR PURPOSES OF PERFORMING THE IMPAIRMENT TEST

FOR GOODWILL AS REQUIRED BY SFAS 142 WE ESTABLISHED THE

FOLLOWING REPORTING UNITS: CABLE NETWORKS, TELEVISION

BROADCASTING, RADIO, STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND

PARKS AND RESORTS.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT ON AN ANNUAL

BASIS TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING

VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS

THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR

VALUE OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING

AMOUNT. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE

ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED.

FAIR VALUES FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, MARKET

MULTIPLES OR APPRAISED VALUES AS APPROPRIATE.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING

UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND

AS APPROPRIATE, FOR ALL OF THE REPORTING UNITS EXCEPT FOR THE

TELEVISION NETWORK WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE TELEVISION

BROADCASTING GROUP. THE TELEVISION BROADCASTING REPORTING UNIT

INCLUDES THE TELEVISION NETWORK AND THE OWNED AND OPERATED

TELEVISION STATIONS. THESE BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN GROUPED TOGETHER

BECAUSE THEIR RESPECTIVE CASH FLOWS ARE DEPENDENT ON ONE

ANOTHER. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TEST, WE USED A REVENUE

MULTIPLE TO VALUE THE TELEVISION NETWORK. WE DID NOT USE A

PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE OR A MARKET MULTIPLE APPROACH TO VALUE

THE TELEVISION NETWORK AS A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE WOULD NOT

CAPTURE THE FULL FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION NETWORK AND THERE

IS LITTLE COMPARABLE MARKET DATA AVAILABLE DUE TO THE SCARCITY

OF TELEVISION NETWORKS. WE APPLIED WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE

MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF THE REPORTING

UNITS. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR

UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST

RESULTS COULD DIFFER.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDE CERTAIN LONG-TERM

INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IS

DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES, AS WELL

AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE

INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT FOR THESE

INVESTMENTS, WE CONSIDER THESE FACTORS AS WELL AS FORECASTED

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTEES. IF THESE FORECASTS ARE

NOT MET, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.

CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES OF THE

PROBABLE COSTS FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS. THESE

ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE

COUNSEL AND ARE BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS,

ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES.

IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR

ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY

AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE PROCEEDINGS. SEE NOTE 13 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION

ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.

INCOME TAX AUDITS

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY

AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME

TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY REACHED A SETTLEMENT

WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE REGARDING ALL

-50-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSESSMENTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO THE

COMPANYS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 1993 THROUGH 1995.

THIS SETTLEMENT RESULTED IN THE COMPANY RELEASING

$120 MILLION IN TAX RESERVES WHICH ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED

WITH RESPECT TO THESE MATTERS. THIS RELEASE OF RESERVES IS

REFLECTED IN THE CURRENT YEAR INCOME TAX PROVISION. DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY RESOLVED CERTAIN

STATE INCOME TAX AUDIT ISSUES AND THE CORRESPONDING RELEASE OF

$56 MILLION OF RELATED TAX RESERVES IS REFLECTED IN THE

2003 INCOME TAX PROVISION.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

FIN 46R

IN DECEMBER 2003, THE FASB ISSUED FIN 46R WHICH

WAS GENERALLY EFFECTIVE AS OF MARCH 31, 2004. VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) ARE PRIMARILY ENTITIES THAT LACK

SUFFICIENT EQUITY TO FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL

FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER PARTIES OR WHOSE EQUITY HOLDERS

LACK ADEQUATE DECISION MAKING ABILITY. ALL VIES WITH WHICH THE

COMPANY IS INVOLVED MUST BE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY OF THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF THE VIE. THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE VIE FOR FINANCIAL

REPORTING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY HAS MINORITY EQUITY INTERESTS IN

CERTAIN ENTITIES, INCLUDING EURO DISNEY S.C.A. (EURO DISNEY) AND

HONGKONG INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS LIMITED (HONG KONG

DISNEYLAND). IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46R, THE

COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND ARE

VIES AND THAT WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. PURSUANT TO THE

TRANSITION PROVISIONS OF FIN 46R, THE COMPANY BEGAN

CONSOLIDATING EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS

BALANCE SHEETS ON MARCH 31, 2004, THE END OF THE

COMPANYS SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2004 AND THE INCOME

AND CASH FLOW STATEMENTS BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2004, THE

BEGINNING OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2004. UNDER FIN

46R TRANSITION RULES, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF EURO DISNEY AND

HONG KONG DISNEYLAND CONTINUED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE EQUITY

METHOD FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2004.

WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE REST OF OUR EQUITY

INVESTMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION AS EITHER THEY ARE NOT

VIES, OR IN THE EVENT THAT THEY ARE VIES, WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN CERTAIN

OTHER VIES THAT WILL NOT BE CONSOLIDATED BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS

NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THESE VIES DO NOT INVOLVE ANY

MATERIAL EXPOSURE TO THE COMPANY.

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003

(FSP 106-2) IN RESPONSE TO A

WELL AS A FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO SPONSORS OF RETIREE HEALTHCARE

BENEFIT PLANS. WE EXPECT THAT THE IMPACT OF THIS ACT WILL NOT BE

MATERIAL.

EITF 00-21

THE COMPANY ADOPTED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE

(EITF) NO. 00-21,

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE

DELIVERABLES

(EITF 00-21), EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1,

2002, IN THE FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003. EITF 00-21

ADDRESSES REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR REVENUES DERIVED FROM A SINGLE

CONTRACT THAT CONTAINS MULTIPLE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. THE RULE

PROVIDES ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO DETERMINE WHEN SUCH REVENUES

MAY BE RECORDED SEPARATELY FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAD RECOGNIZED THE NFL BROADCAST

PORTION OF ESPNS AFFILIATE REVENUE WHEN THE NFL GAMES WERE

AIRED, AS ESPNS AFFILIATE CONTRACTS PROVIDED A BASIS FOR

ALLOCATING SUCH REVENUE BETWEEN NFL AND NON-NFL PROGRAMMING.

SINCE THE COST OF THE NFL RIGHTS HAD ALSO BEEN RECOGNIZED AS THE

GAMES WERE AIRED, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED BOTH THE NFL REVENUES

AND NFL COSTS IN THE QUARTERS THE GAMES WERE AIRED.

UNDER EITF 00-21S REQUIREMENTS FOR

SEPARATING THE REVENUE ELEMENTS OF A SINGLE CONTRACT, THE

COMPANY NO LONGER ALLOCATES ESPNS AFFILIATE REVENUE

BETWEEN NFL AND NON-NFL PROGRAMMING FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. AS

A CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY NO LONGER MATCHES ALL NFL REVENUE

WITH NFL COSTS AS ESPN AFFILIATE REVENUE (INCLUDING THE NFL

PORTION) IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR,

WHILE NFL CONTRACT COSTS CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE

QUARTERS THE GAMES ARE AIRED. THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE IMPACTS

ONLY THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION AND HAS NO IMPACT ON CASH

FLOW. AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE, THE MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT

REPORTS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED REVENUE

-53-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND PROFITABILITY IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER

WHEN THE MAJORITY OF THE NFL GAMES ARE AIRED, WITH

COMMENSURATELY INCREASED REVENUES AND PROFITS IN THE SECOND AND

THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS.

THE COMPANY ELECTED TO ADOPT THIS NEW ACCOUNTING

RULE USING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT APPROACH. IN THE FISCAL FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF

$71 MILLION FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN

ACCOUNTING AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2003. THIS AMOUNT

REPRESENTED THE REVENUE RECORDED FOR NFL GAMES IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2002, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED

RATABLY OVER FISCAL 2003 UNDER THE NEW ACCOUNTING METHOD.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF

1995 PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE

BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE

WRITTEN OR ORAL STATEMENTS THAT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING,

INCLUDING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER FILINGS

WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND IN REPORTS TO

OUR SHAREHOLDERS. SUCH STATEMENTS MAY, FOR EXAMPLE, EXPRESS

EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE ACTIONS THAT WE MAY

TAKE, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING OR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OR ABOUT

DEVELOPMENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL INCLUDING CHANGES IN DOMESTIC OR

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE MADE ON THE

BASIS OF MANAGEMENTS VIEWS AND ASSUMPTIONS AS OF THE TIME

THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE

THESE STATEMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR

EXPECTATIONS WILL NECESSARILY COME TO PASS.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS.

FOR AN ENTERPRISE AS LARGE

AND COMPLEX AS THE COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS COULD

MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE.

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE

IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THESE

OPERATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS

ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT. GENERAL FACTORS AFFECTING OUR

OPERATIONS INCLUDE.

CHANGES IN COMPANY-WIDE OR BUSINESS-UNIT

STRATEGIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN THE TYPES OR MIX OF

BUSINESSES IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED OR WILL INVEST;

CHANGES IN U.S., GLOBAL OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY AFFECT ATTENDANCE AND SPENDING AT THE

COMPANYS PARKS AND RESORTS, PURCHASES OF COMPANY-LICENSED

CONSUMER PRODUCTS, THE ADVERTISING MARKET FOR BROADCAST AND

CABLE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE

COMPANYS THEATRICAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT RELEASES;

CHANGES IN U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND EQUITY

MARKETS, INCLUDING MARKET DISRUPTIONS AND SIGNIFICANT INTEREST

RATE FLUCTUATIONS, WHICH MAY IMPEDE THE COMPANYS ACCESS

TO, OR INCREASE THE COST OF, EXTERNAL FINANCING FOR ITS

OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS;

CHANGES IN COST OF PROVIDING PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN HEALTH

CARE COSTS, INVESTMENT RETURNS ON PLAN ASSETS, AND DISCOUNT

RATES USED TO CALCULATE PENSION AND RELATED LIABILITIES;

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, BOTH

DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, WHICH MAY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANYS PARKS AND RESORTS

OPERATIONS, DIVERT CONSUMERS FROM OUR CREATIVE OR OTHER

PRODUCTS, OR TO OTHER PRODUCTS OR OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT,

OR LEAD TO INCREASED EXPENSES IN SUCH AREAS AS TELEVISION

PROGRAMMING ACQUISITION AND MOTION PICTURE PRODUCTION AND

MARKETING;

LEGAL AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY AFFECT

PARTICULAR BUSINESS UNITS, SUCH AS REGULATORY ACTIONS AFFECTING

ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES, CONSUMER PRODUCTS, THEME PARK SAFETY,

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT

MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST

RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE

MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY

ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THE COMPANYS

EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND

THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY

SECURITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST

RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY

ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER OVERALL BORROWING COSTS.

TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE

SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO

THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET

DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW

VOLATILITY IN ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE

BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS

INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN

CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED FOREIGN

CURRENCY REVENUES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTION STRATEGIES AND

FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE SALE OF FOREIGN

CURRENCIES TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED,

TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE

FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE PRINCIPAL FOREIGN

CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN AND

CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY

CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLAR

DENOMINATED BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE

COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES OF ITS

FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES GENERALLY FOR PERIODS NOT

TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS

OFFSET CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES.

-55-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ENTER INTO

FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED

NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

VALUE AT RISK (VAR)

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VAR MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE

MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INTEREST

RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES WERE MADE ASSUMING NORMAL

MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. VARIOUS MODELING

TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED IN A VAR COMPUTATION. THE COMPANYS

COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN

MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND EQUITY

PRICES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE

INTERRELATIONSHIPS WERE DETERMINED BY OBSERVING INTEREST RATE,

FOREIGN CURRENCY AND EQUITY MARKET CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING

QUARTER FOR THE CALCULATION OF VAR AMOUNTS AT SEPTEMBER 30,

2004. THE MODEL INCLUDES ALL OF THE COMPANYS DEBT AS WELL

AS ALL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE VALUES OF FOREIGN

EXCHANGE OPTIONS DO NOT CHANGE ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS WITH THE

UNDERLYING CURRENCIES, AS EXCHANGE RATES VARY. THEREFORE, THE

HEDGE COVERAGE ASSUMED TO BE OBTAINED FROM EACH OPTION HAS BEEN

ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ITS RESPECTIVE SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN

CURRENCY VALUES. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS AND

RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES, WHICH CERTAIN OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO

HEDGE, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES

NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WILL

BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL

EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS.

VAR ON A COMBINED BASIS DECREASED FROM

$51 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 TO $31 MILLION

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004. THE MAJORITY OF THE DECREASE IS DUE

TO INCREASED CORRELATION BENEFITS AND LOWER MARKET VALUE OF

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN

FAIR VALUE, CALCULATED USING THE VAR MODEL, IS AS FOLLOWS

(UNAUDITED, IN MILLIONS).

THE VAR FOR EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND

IS IMMATERIAL AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004. IN CALCULATING THE

VAR IT WAS DETERMINED THAT CREDIT RISKS ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVER

FOR CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF EURO DISNEYS DEBT RATHER THAN

INTEREST RATE RISKS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE EXCLUDED EURO

DISNEYS BORROWINGS FROM THE VAR CALCULATION.

CHANGES IN INTERNAL CONTROLS 

IN FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANY INITIATED

A COMPANY-WIDE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW INTEGRATED FINANCE AND

HUMAN RESOURCES APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE, RELATED INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, AND ENTERPRISE-WIDE SHARED SERVICES (THE NEW

SYSTEMS). AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS UNITS WERE USING THE NEW SYSTEMS AND

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

COMPANYS BUSINESSES ARE USING THE NEW SYSTEMS. THE

IMPLEMENTATION HAS INVOLVED CHANGES IN SYSTEMS THAT INCLUDED

INTERNAL CONTROLS, AND ACCORDINGLY, THESE CHANGES HAVE REQUIRED

CHANGES TO OUR SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS. WE HAVE REVIEWED

EACH SYSTEM AS IT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED AND THE CONTROLS AFFECTED

BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW SYSTEMS AND MADE APPROPRIATE

CHANGES TO AFFECTED INTERNAL CONTROLS AS WE IMPLEMENTED THE NEW

SYSTEMS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONTROLS AS MODIFIED ARE

APPROPRIATE AND FUNCTIONING EFFECTIVELY.

FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, BASED ON CRITERIA

ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COSO. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE

OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING

THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND

PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN

THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE

MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY

AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE

ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE

WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY;

AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION

OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR

DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT

MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF

EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT

CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS,

OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES

MAY DETERIORATE.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB INTERPRETATION

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

COMPANY INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES AFTER ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND

TRANSACTIONS. IN DECEMBER 1999, DVD FINANCING, INC. (DFI), A

SUBSIDIARY OF DISNEY VACATION DEVELOPMENT, INC. AND AN INDIRECT

SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, COMPLETED A RECEIVABLE SALE

TRANSACTION. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SALE, DFI PREPARES SEPARATE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH ITS SEPARATE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE ALSO CONSOLIDATED IN THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

FIN 46R

IN DECEMBER 2003, FASB ISSUED FIN 46R WHICH WAS

GENERALLY EFFECTIVE AS OF MARCH 31, 2004. VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES (VIES) ARE PRIMARILY ENTITIES THAT LACK SUFFICIENT

EQUITY TO FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL

SUPPORT FROM OTHER PARTIES OR WHOSE EQUITY HOLDERS LACK ADEQUATE

DECISION MAKING ABILITY. ALL VIES WITH WHICH THE COMPANY IS

INVOLVED MUST BE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY

OF THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF THE VIE. THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IS

REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE VIE FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY HAS MINORITY EQUITY INTERESTS IN

CERTAIN ENTITIES, INCLUDING EURO DISNEY S.C.A. (EURO DISNEY) AND

HONGKONG INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS LIMITED (HONG KONG

DISNEYLAND). IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46R, THE

COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND ARE

VIES AND THAT WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. PURSUANT TO THE

TRANSITION PROVISIONS OF FIN 46R, THE COMPANY BEGAN

CONSOLIDATING EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS

BALANCE SHEETS ON MARCH 31, 2004, THE END OF THE

COMPANYS SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2004 AND THE INCOME

AND CASH FLOW STATEMENTS BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2004, THE

BEGINNING OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2004. UNDER FIN

46R TRANSITION RULES, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF EURO DISNEY AND

HONG KONG DISNEYLAND CONTINUED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE EQUITY

METHOD FOR THE SIX MONTH PERIOD ENDED MARCH 31, 2004. SEE

NOTE 4 FOR THE IMPACT OF CONSOLIDATING THE BALANCE SHEETS,

INCOME STATEMENT AND CASH FLOW STATEMENTS OF EURO DISNEY AND

HONG KONG DISNEYLAND.

WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE REST OF OUR EQUITY

INVESTMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION AS EITHER THEY ARE NOT

VIES, OR IN THE EVENT THAT THEY ARE VIES, WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN CERTAIN

OTHER VIES THAT WILL NOT BE CONSOLIDATED BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS

NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THESE VIES DO NOT INVOLVE ANY

MATERIAL EXPOSURE TO THE COMPANY.

FSP 106-2

IN MAY 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION

NO. 106-2,

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003

(FSP 106-2) IN RESPONSE TO A NEW

LAW REGARDING PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS UNDER MEDICARE AS WELL

AS A FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO SPONSORS OF RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFIT

PLANS. WE EXPECT THAT THE IMPACT OF THIS ACT WILL NOT BE

MATERIAL.

EITF 00-21

THE COMPANY ADOPTED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE

(EITF) NO. 00-21,

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH

MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES

(EITF 00-21), EFFECTIVE

OCTOBER 1, 2002, IN THE FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003.

EITF 00-21 ADDRESSES REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR REVENUES

DERIVED FROM A SINGLE CONTRACT THAT CONTAINS MULTIPLE PRODUCTS

OR SERVICES. THE RULE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO

DETERMINE WHEN SUCH REVENUES MAY BE RECORDED SEPARATELY FOR

ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAD RECOGNIZED

THE NFL BROADCAST PORTION OF ESPNS AFFILIATE REVENUE WHEN

THE NFL GAMES WERE AIRED, AS ESPNS AFFILIATE CONTRACTS

PROVIDED A BASIS FOR ALLOCATING SUCH REVENUE BETWEEN NFL AND

NON-NFL PROGRAMMING. SINCE THE COST OF THE NFL RIGHTS HAD ALSO

BEEN RECOGNIZED AS THE GAMES WERE AIRED, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED

BOTH THE NFL REVENUES AND NFL COSTS IN THE QUARTERS THE GAMES

WERE AIRED.

UNDER EITF 00-21S REQUIREMENTS FOR

SEPARATING THE REVENUE ELEMENTS OF A SINGLE CONTRACT, THE

COMPANY NO LONGER ALLOCATES ESPNS AFFILIATE REVENUE

BETWEEN NFL AND NON-NFL PROGRAMMING FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. AS

A CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY WILL NO LONGER MATCH ALL NFL REVENUE

WITH NFL COSTS AS ESPN AFFILIATE REVENUE (INCLUDING THE NFL

PORTION) IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR,

WHILE NFL CONTRACT COSTS CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE

QUARTERS THE GAMES ARE AIRED. THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE IMPACTS

ONLY THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION AND HAS NO IMPACT ON CASH

FLOW.

THE COMPANY ELECTED TO ADOPT THIS NEW ACCOUNTING

RULE USING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT APPROACH. IN THE FISCAL FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF

$71 MILLION FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN

ACCOUNTING AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2003. THIS AMOUNT

REPRESENTED THE REVENUE RECORDED FOR NFL GAMES IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2002, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED

RATABLY OVER FISCAL 2003 UNDER THE NEW ACCOUNTING METHOD.

RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2003 WERE RESTATED TO REFLECT THE IMPACT OF

EITF 00-21 AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2002.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

FOOTNOTES THERETO. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE

ESTIMATES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

BROADCAST ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED

WHEN COMMERCIALS ARE AIRED. REVENUES FROM TELEVISION

SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS PRIMARY

CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE

PROVIDED. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CONTRACTS WITH CABLE

SERVICE PROVIDERS INCLUDE ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS. IN

THESE CASES, REVENUE SUBJECT TO THE COMMITMENT IS DEFERRED UNTIL

THE ANNUAL COMMITMENTS ARE SATISFIED WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN

REVENUE SHIFTING FROM THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR TO THE SECOND.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES ARE

RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. REVENUES FROM CORPORATE

SPONSORS AT THE THEME PARKS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED OVER THE

PERIOD OF THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENTS COMMENCING WITH THE OPENING

OF THE RELATED ATTRACTION.

REVENUES FROM THE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION OF

MOTION PICTURES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN MOTION PICTURES ARE

EXHIBITED. REVENUES FROM VIDEO SALES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE DATE

THAT VIDEO UNITS ARE MADE WIDELY AVAILABLE FOR SALE BY

RETAILERS. REVENUES FROM THE LICENSING OF FEATURE FILMS AND

TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ARE RECORDED WHEN THE MATERIAL IS

AVAILABLE FOR TELECASTING BY THE LICENSEE AND WHEN CERTAIN OTHER

CONDITIONS ARE MET.

MERCHANDISE LICENSING ADVANCE AND GUARANTEE

PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE UNDERLYING ROYALTIES ARE EARNED.

ADVERTISING EXPENSE

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ADVERTISING EXPENSE INCURRED FOR THE YEARS ENDED

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, 2003, AND 2002 TOTALED

$3.0 BILLION, $2.5 BILLION AND $2.3 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH ON HAND

AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE

MONTHS OR LESS.

INVESTMENTS

DEBT SECURITIES THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE POSITIVE

INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS

HELD-TO-MATURITY AND REPORTED AT AMORTIZED COST.

DEBT SECURITIES NOT CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER

TRADING OR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, AND ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED

IN EARNINGS OR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, RESPECTIVELY. ALL

OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING EITHER THE COST

METHOD OR THE EQUITY METHOD.

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS

TO DETERMINE WHETHER A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW THE COST

BASIS IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. IF THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS

JUDGED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COST BASIS OF THE

SECURITY IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE

WRITE-DOWN IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TRANSLATION POLICY

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE PREDOMINANT

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS. THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR

EURO DISNEY, HONG KONG DISNEYLAND AND INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS OF

THE DISNEY STORES.

FOR U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

LOCATIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

REMEASURED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE

RATES, EXCEPT FOR PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, OTHER ASSETS

AND DEFERRED REVENUE, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL

EXCHANGE RATES. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE

EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING EACH PERIOD, EXCEPT FOR THOSE

EXPENSES RELATED TO THE PREVIOUSLY NOTED BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS,

WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. GAINS OR

LOSSES FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT ARE INCLUDED IN NET

EARNINGS.

FOR THE LOCAL CURRENCY FUNCTIONAL LOCATIONS,

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED AT END-OF-PERIOD RATES

WHILE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES IN

EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD. EQUITY IS TRANSLATED AT HISTORICAL

RATES AND THE RESULTING CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE

INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (AOCI).

INVENTORIES

CARRYING AMOUNTS OF MERCHANDISE, MATERIALS AND

SUPPLIES INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A MOVING

AVERAGE COST BASIS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS INCLUDE CAPITALIZABLE

DIRECT NEGATIVE COSTS, PRODUCTION OVERHEAD, INTEREST,

DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND ACQUIRED PRODUCTION COSTS AND ARE STATED

AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR FAIR

VALUE. ACQUIRED PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR THE COMPANYS

TELEVISION AND CABLE/SATELLITE NETWORKS ARE STATED AT THE LOWER

OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE.

ACQUIRED TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE

RECORDED WHEN THE LICENSE PERIOD BEGINS AND THE PROGRAM IS

AVAILABLE FOR USE. MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, AND GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND PARTICIPATION

COSTS ARE EXPENSED BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT

PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS

REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES ON AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION BASIS.

TELEVISION NETWORK SERIES COSTS AND MULTI-YEAR SPORTS RIGHTS ARE

CHARGED TO EXPENSE BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT

PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS

REVENUES FROM SUCH PROGRAMS OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, AS

APPROPRIATE. ESTIMATED REMAINING GROSS REVENUE FOR FILM

PRODUCTIONS INCLUDES REVENUE THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN

YEARS OF THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR

TELEVISION NETWORK SERIES, WE INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE

EARNED WITHIN 10 YEARS OF THE DELIVERY OF THE FIRST

EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF

DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE. FOR ACQUIRED FILM

LIBRARIES, REMAINING REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO BE EARNED FOR

UP TO 20 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. TELEVISION

NETWORK AND STATION RIGHTS FOR THEATRICAL MOVIES AND OTHER

LONG-FORM PROGRAMMING ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE PRIMARILY ON AN

ACCELERATED BASIS RELATED TO THE PROJECTED USAGE OF THE

PROGRAMS. DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN

DETERMINED WILL NOT GO INTO PRODUCTION OR HAVE NOT BEEN SET FOR

PRODUCTION WITHIN THREE YEARS ARE WRITTEN-OFF.

ESTIMATES OF TOTAL GROSS REVENUES CAN CHANGE

SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ADVERTISING

RATES AND THE LEVEL OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCTION.

ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND

AMORTIZATION IS ADJUSTED, IF NECESSARY. SUCH ADJUSTMENTS COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE

PERIODS. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF NETWORK TELEVISION

BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS IS REVIEWED USING A

DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF

PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS

OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE EARLY

MORNING, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN AND

SPORTS (SPORTS INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE

VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED

BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL.

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS

THE COMPANY EXPENSES COSTS INCURRED IN THE

PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE OF DEVELOPING OR ACQUIRING INTERNAL

USE SOFTWARE, SUCH AS RESEARCH AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES, AS WELL

AS COSTS INCURRED IN THE POST-IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONAL

STAGE, SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING.

CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OCCURS ONLY AFTER

THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE IS COMPLETE, MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZES

THE PROJECT, AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE

COMPLETED AND THE SOFTWARE WILL BE USED FOR THE FUNCTION

INTENDED. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003, CAPITALIZED

SOFTWARE COSTS TOTALED $433 MILLION AND $240 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE

SOFTWARE, WHICH RANGES FROM 2-10 YEARS.

PARKS, RESORTS AND OTHER PROPERTY

PARKS, RESORTS AND OTHER PROPERTY ARE CARRIED AT

HISTORICAL COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED ON THE STRAIGHT-LINE

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST AT

FISCAL YEAR END FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDE FCC LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS.

GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE

EITHER THE OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE REPORTING LEVEL BELOW THE

OPERATING SEGMENT. FOR PURPOSES OF PERFORMING THE IMPAIRMENT

TEST FOR GOODWILL AS REQUIRED BY SFAS 142, WE ESTABLISHED

THE FOLLOWING REPORTING UNITS: CABLE NETWORKS, TELEVISION

BROADCASTING, RADIO, STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND

PARKS AND RESORTS.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT ON AN

ANNUAL BASIS TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN

ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT

THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS

LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE

FAIR VALUE OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS

CARRYING AMOUNT. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS

RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS,

MARKET MULTIPLES OR APPRAISED VALUES AS APPROPRIATE.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING

UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND

AS APPROPRIATE, FOR ALL OF THE REPORTING UNITS EXCEPT FOR THE

TELEVISION NETWORK WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE TELEVISION

BROADCASTING GROUP. THE TELEVISION BROADCASTING REPORTING UNIT

INCLUDES THE TELEVISION NETWORK AND THE OWNED AND OPERATED

TELEVISION STATIONS. THESE BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN GROUPED TOGETHER

BECAUSE THEIR RESPECTIVE CASH FLOWS ARE DEPENDENT ON ONE

ANOTHER. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TEST, WE USED A REVENUE

MULTIPLE TO VALUE THE TELEVISION NETWORK. WE DID NOT USE A

PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE OR A MARKET MULTIPLE APPROACH TO VALUE

THE TELEVISION NETWORK AS A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE WOULD NOT

CAPTURE THE FULL FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION NETWORK AND THERE

IS LITTLE COMPARABLE MARKET DATA AVAILABLE DUE TO THE SCARCITY

OF TELEVISION NETWORKS. WE APPLIED WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE

MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF THE REPORTING

UNITS. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR

UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST

RESULTS COULD DIFFER.

AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AS FOLLOWS.

COPYRIGHTS

10  31  YEARS

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY

EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS

EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES AND INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES,

INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS;

FORWARD, OPTION AND SWAPTION CONTRACTS AND INTEREST

RATE CAPS.

-77-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS

BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS

RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR UNDERTAKING

VARIOUS HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DERIVATIVES

INTO WHICH THE COMPANY ENTERS: HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AND

HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE. HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE ARE

ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED

ASSET, LIABILITY, OR A FIRM COMMITMENT. HEDGES OF CASH FLOW

EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE A FORECASTED

TRANSACTION (E.G. FORECASTED REVENUE) OR THE VARIABILITY OF CASH

FLOWS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED, RELATED TO A RECOGNIZED LIABILITY

OR ASSET (E.G. FLOATING RATE DEBT).

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES AND ASSIGNS THE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFIC

ASSETS, OR SPECIFIC LIABILITIES. WHEN HEDGED ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES ARE SOLD OR EXTINGUISHED OR THE FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO OCCUR, THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED HEDGING

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OPTION PREMIUMS AND UNREALIZED LOSSES ON FORWARD

CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE

RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS OTHER ASSETS. UNREALIZED GAINS

ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST

RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID UNDER THE AGREEMENTS

ARE INCLUDED IN LIABILITIES. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM

HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT CONSISTENT WITH

THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. THE COMPANY

ACCRUES THE DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY

SWAPS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS AS INTEREST

RATES AND EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST

EXPENSE OVER THE LIVES OF THE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE

TERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE SWAP AGREEMENTS, PRIOR TO THEIR

ORIGINAL MATURITY, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO INTEREST

EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED

TRANSACTIONS.

CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY AS

THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (SEE NOTES 6 AND 12).

EARNINGS PER SHARE

THE COMPANY PRESENTS BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AMOUNTS. BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY

DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON

SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EPS IS BASED UPON

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT

SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR WHICH IS CALCULATED USING THE

TREASURY STOCK METHOD FOR STOCK OPTIONS AND ASSUMES CONVERSION

OF THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES (SEE

NOTE 6). COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE

COMPUTATION IN PERIODS IN WHICH THEY HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE

EFFECT. STOCK OPTIONS FOR WHICH THE EXERCISE PRICE EXCEEDS THE

AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OVER THE PERIOD HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE

EFFECT ON EPS AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE

CALCULATION.

A RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME AND THE WEIGHTED

AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES

SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS

ON FEBRUARY 17, 2004, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED

THE FILM LIBRARY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS FOR THE

MUPPETS AND BEAR IN THE BIG BLUE HOUSE FOR $68 MILLION.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO

DEFINITE-LIVED IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

IN FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY SOLD THE ANAHEIM

ANGELS BASEBALL TEAM, WHICH RESULTED IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF

$16 MILLION. IN FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANY SOLD THE DISNEY

STORE OPERATIONS IN JAPAN GENERATING A PRE-TAX GAIN OF

$34 MILLION. THESE GAINS ARE REPORTED IN THE LINE

GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESS IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

ON OCTOBER 24, 2001, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED

FOX FAMILY WORLDWIDE, INC. (NOW CALLED ABC FAMILY)

FOR $5.2 BILLION, WHICH WAS FUNDED WITH $2.9 BILLION

OF NEW LONG-TERM BORROWINGS PLUS THE ASSUMPTION OF

$2.3 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT. AMONG THE BUSINESSES

ACQUIRED WERE THE FOX FAMILY CHANNEL, WHICH HAS BEEN RENAMED ABC

FAMILY CHANNEL, A PROGRAMMING SERVICE THAT CURRENTLY REACHES

APPROXIMATELY 88 MILLION CABLE AND SATELLITE TELEVISION

SUBSCRIBERS THROUGHOUT THE U.S.; A 75% INTEREST IN FOX KIDS

EUROPE, WHICH HAS BEEN RENAMED JETIX

-79-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EUROPE AND REACHES MORE THAN 37 MILLION

SUBSCRIBERS ACROSS EUROPE; JETIX CHANNELS IN LATIN AMERICA, AND

THE SABAN LIBRARY AND ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION BUSINESSES.

THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE ACQUIRED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE EXCESS

PURCHASE PRICE OF $5.0 BILLION WAS RECORDED AS GOODWILL AND

WAS ASSIGNED TO THE CABLE NETWORKS REPORTING UNIT WITHIN THE

MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT. NONE OF THIS AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO BE

DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES.

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS HAVE INCORPORATED ABC FAMILYS ACTIVITY ON A

CONSOLIDATED BASIS FROM OCTOBER 24, 2001, THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION. ON AN UNAUDITED PRO FORMA BASIS ASSUMING THE

ACQUISITION OCCURRED ON OCTOBER 1, 2001, REVENUES FOR THE

YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 WERE $25,360 MILLION.

AS-REPORTED AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER

SHARE FOR FISCAL 2002 WERE APPROXIMATELY THE SAME. THE UNAUDITED

COMPANY AND CDC CANNOT BE PAID UNTIL ALL SENIOR BORROWINGS HAVE

BEEN PAID.

THE MOA ADDITIONALLY PROVIDES FOR THE

CONTRIBUTION BY EURO DISNEY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES (INCLUDING MOST OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE EQUITY

RIGHTS OFFERINGS REFERRED TO ABOVE) INTO EURO DISNEY

ASSOCIÉS S.C.A. (DISNEY SCA) WHICH WILL BECOME

AN 82% OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EURO DISNEY. OTHER WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY WILL RETAIN THE REMAINING 18%

OWNERSHIP INTEREST. THIS WILL ENABLE EURO DISNEY TO AVOID HAVING

TO MAKE



292 MILLION

OF PAYMENTS TO DISNEY SCA THAT WOULD BE DUE IF EURO DISNEY

EXERCISED THE OPTIONS UNDER CERTAIN LEASES FROM DISNEY SCA. AS A

RESULT OF THIS CONTRIBUTION, THE COMPANY WILL INCREASE ITS

OVERALL EFFECTIVE OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN EURO DISNEYS

OPERATIONS FROM 41% TO 52%. PURSUANT TO THE MOA, THE COMPANY

MUST MAINTAIN AT LEAST A DIRECT 39% OWNERSHIP INVESTMENT IN EURO

DISNEY THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2016.

THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MOA REMAINS SUBJECT TO

CERTAIN CONDITIONS INCLUDING: APPROVAL OF THE REORGANIZATION BY

THE SHAREHOLDERS (WHICH THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO VOTE IN FAVOR

OF) AND THE COMPLETION OF THE EQUITY RIGHTS OFFERING (REFERRED

TO ABOVE) BY MARCH 31, 2005. ONCE IMPLEMENTED, THE

RESTRUCTURING WILL PROVIDE EURO DISNEY WITH SIGNIFICANT

LIQUIDITY, INCLUDING PROTECTIVE MEASURES INTENDED TO MITIGATE

THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF BUSINESS VOLATILITY AS WELL AS CAPITAL TO

INVEST IN NEW RIDES AND ATTRACTIONS. IF THE EQUITY RIGHTS

OFFERING DOES NOT OCCUR BY MARCH 31, 2005, THE PARTIES WILL

HAVE 30 DAYS TO NEGOTIATE A NEW ARRANGEMENT. IF THE

NEGOTIATIONS DO NOT SUCCEED, MOST OF THE PROVISIONS OF THE MOA

WILL BECOME NULL AND VOID, AND EURO DISNEYS DEBT WILL

BECOME DUE OR SUBJECT TO ACCELERATION, AND ABSENT A FURTHER DEBT

COVENANT WAIVER OR NEW AGREEMENT, EURO DISNEY WOULD BE UNABLE TO

PAY CERTAIN OF ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE MOA WILL RESULT IN THE

ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN SUBLEASE ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THE

COMPANYS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, DISNEY SCA AND EURO

DISNEY. THESE SUBLEASES AROSE IN CONNECTION WITH A FINANCIAL

RESTRUCTURING OF EURO DISNEY IN 1994 WHEREBY DISNEY SCA (WHICH

WAS THEN IN THE FORM OF A SNC) ENTERED INTO A LEASE AGREEMENT

WITH A FINANCING COMPANY WITH A NON-CANCELABLE TERM OF

12 YEARS RELATED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DISNEYLAND

PARK ASSETS, AND THEN ENTERED INTO A 12-YEAR SUBLEASE AGREEMENT

WITH EURO DISNEY ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME PAYMENT TERMS.

REMAINING LEASE RENTALS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 OF

APPROXIMATELY $385 MILLION RECEIVABLE FROM EURO DISNEY

UNDER THE SUBLEASE APPROXIMATE THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY DISNEY SCA

UNDER THE LEASE. THESE LEASE TRANSACTIONS ARE CURRENTLY

ELIMINATED UPON CONSOLIDATION OF EURO DISNEY BY THE COMPANY AS A

RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 46R. IF THE

RESTRUCTURING DOES NOT OCCUR AS PLANNED ABOVE, AT THE CONCLUSION

OF THE SUBLEASE TERM IN 2006, EURO DISNEY WOULD HAVE THE OPTION

OF ASSUMING DISNEY SCAS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE

LEASE FOR A PAYMENT OF $97 MILLION OVER THE ENSUING

15 MONTHS. IF EURO DISNEY DID NOT EXERCISE ITS OPTION,

DISNEY SCA WOULD BE ABLE TO PURCHASE THE ASSETS, CONTINUE TO

LEASE THE ASSETS OR ELECT TO

-83-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TERMINATE THE LEASE. IN THE EVENT THAT THE LEASE

WAS TERMINATED, DISNEY SCA WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE A

TERMINATION PAYMENT TO THE LESSOR EQUAL TO 75% OF THE

LESSORS THEN OUTSTANDING DEBT RELATED TO THE DISNEYLAND

PARK ASSETS, WHICH PAYMENT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY

$1.4 BILLION. DISNEY SCA WOULD THEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO SELL

OR LEASE THE ASSETS ON BEHALF OF THE LESSOR TO SATISFY THE

REMAINING DEBT, WITH ANY EXCESS PROCEEDS PAYABLE TO DISNEY SCA.

SEE NOTE 6 FOR THE TERMS OF EURO

DISNEYS BORROWINGS.

EURO DISNEY HAD REVENUES AND NET LOSS OF

$575 MILLION AND $122 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE

SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 WHILE THE COMPANY STILL

ACCOUNTED FOR ITS INVESTMENT ON THE EQUITY METHOD. EURO DISNEY

HAD REVENUES AND NET LOSS OF $1,077 MILLION AND

$56 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE YEAR ENDED

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

2002, EURO DISNEY HAD REVENUES AND NET LOSS OF $909 MILLION

AND $57 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL

LIABILITIES OF EURO DISNEY WERE $3,373 MILLION AND

$3,304 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003.

OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS

IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN

EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND, THE COMPANY HAS OTHER

EQUITY INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF CABLE INVESTMENTS

SUCH AS A&E TELEVISION NETWORKS (37.5% OWNED), LIFETIME

ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES (50% OWNED) AND E! ENTERTAINMENT

TELEVISION (39.6% OWNED).

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003, THE

COMPANY HELD $60 MILLION AND $17 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. AS

OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003, THE COMPANY ALSO HELD

$105 MILLION AND $89 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF

NON-PUBLICLY TRADED COST METHOD INVESTMENTS. REALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES ARE DETERMINED PRINCIPALLY ON AN AVERAGE COST BASIS. IN

2004, 2003 AND 2002, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $2 MILLION,

$8 MILLION AND $239 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN NET

GAINS ON SALES OF SECURITIES. INCLUDED IN FISCAL 2002 IS A

$216 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE REMAINING SHARES OF

KNIGHT RIDDER STOCK THAT THE COMPANY HAD RECEIVED IN CONNECTION

WITH THE DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN PUBLISHING OPERATIONS THAT HAD

BEEN ACQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF ABC.

IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED

NON-CASH CHARGES OF $23 MILLION, $23 MILLION AND

$2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO REFLECT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

LOSSES IN VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENT IN LEVERAGED LEASES

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY

RECORDED A $16 MILLION PRE-TAX CHARGE TO WRITE DOWN ITS

LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT IN DELTA. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF

FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY WROTE OFF ITS AIRCRAFT

-84-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT WITH UNITED AIRLINES,

WHICH FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION, RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX

CHARGE OF $114 MILLION, OR $0.04 PER SHARE. BASED ON

THE BANKRUPTCY FILING, WE BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE

COMPANY WILL RECOVER THIS INVESTMENT. THE PRE-TAX CHARGE OF

$114 MILLION FOR THE WRITE-OFF IS REPORTED IN NET

INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, OUR REMAINING AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED

LEASE INVESTMENT TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $156 MILLION,

CONSISTING OF $101 MILLION AND $55 MILLION, WITH DELTA

AND FEDEX, RESPECTIVELY. GIVEN THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE AIRLINE

INDUSTRY, WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE

INVESTMENTS, PARTICULARLY THE DELTA LEASES. DELTA HAS DISCLOSED

THAT IF IT IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN REDUCING ITS OPERATING EXPENSES

AND CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES, IT WILL NEED TO

SEEK TO RESTRUCTURE ITS COSTS UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE

U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE. ALTHOUGH DELTA REMAINS CURRENT ON

THEIR LEASE PAYMENTS TO US, THE INABILITY OF DELTA TO MAKE THEIR

LEASE PAYMENTS, OR THE TERMINATION OF OUR LEASE THROUGH A

BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING, COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHARGE FOR THE

WRITE-DOWN OF OUR INVESTMENT AND COULD ACCELERATE CERTAIN INCOME

TAX PAYMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMERCIAL PAPER

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY MAINTAINS U.S. AND EUROPEAN

COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS WITH A COMBINED PROGRAM SIZE OF

$4.5 BILLION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, THE COMPANY

HAD ESTABLISHED BANK FACILITIES TOTALING $4.5 BILLION TO

SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS, WITH HALF OF THE FACILITIES

SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN FEBRUARY 2005 AND THE OTHER HALF IN

FEBRUARY 2009. UNDER THE BANK FACILITIES, THE COMPANY HAS THE

OPTION TO BORROW AT LIBOR-BASED RATES PLUS A SPREAD DEPENDING ON

THE COMPANYS SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT RATING. THE

COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY ONE FINANCIAL

COVENANT, RELATING TO INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE COMPANY MET

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. THE

COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES ALSO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE CERTAIN

ENTITIES, INCLUDING EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND, FROM

ANY REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD NOT BORROWED AGAINST

THE FACILITIES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO ISSUE UP TO

$500 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE FACILITY

EXPIRING IN 2009, WHICH IF UTILIZED, REDUCES AVAILABLE BORROWING

UNDER THIS FACILITY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004,

$205 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT HAD BEEN ISSUED UNDER

THIS FACILITY AND $2.045 BILLION WAS AVAILABLE FOR

BORROWING. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, $100 MILLION OF

COMMERCIAL PAPER DEBT WAS OUTSTANDING.

$7.5 BILLION SHELF REGISTRATION

STATEMENT

IN AUGUST 2001, THE COMPANY FILED A

U.S. SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) THAT ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ISSUE

FROM TIME TO TIME UP TO $7.5 BILLION OF SECURITIES,

INCLUDING DEBT SECURITIES, PREFERRED STOCK, COMMON STOCK,

DEPOSITORY SHARES, WARRANTS AND PURCHASE CONTRACTS. AT

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004

AND 2003 WERE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATING TO A

PORTION OF THE TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN NET

OPERATING LOSSES (NOLS) REFLECTED ON STATE TAX RETURNS OF

INFOSEEK AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE INFOSEEK

ACQUISITION ON NOVEMBER 18, 1999 WHERE APPLICABLE STATE

LAWS LIMIT THE UTILIZATION OF SUCH NOLS. IN ADDITION, DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003 WERE REDUCED BY A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE TAX BENEFITS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN NOLS REFLECTED ON TAX RETURNS OF ABC

FAMILY WORLDWIDE, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO

THE ABC FAMILY ACQUISITION ON OCTOBER 24, 2001 (SEE

NOTE 3). SINCE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES ASSOCIATED WITH

BOTH ACQUISITIONS RELATE TO ACQUIRED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, THE

SUBSEQUENT REALIZATION OF THESE TAX BENEFITS WOULD RESULT IN

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ALLOWANCE AMOUNT BEING APPLIED AS REDUCTIONS

TO GOODWILL. IN ADDITION, AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004,

APPROXIMATELY $42 MILLION OF OTHER ACQUIRED NOL CARRY

FORWARDS FROM THE ACQUISITION OF ABC FAMILY ARE AVAILABLE TO

OFFSET FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME THROUGH THE YEAR 2022.

IN 2004, 2003, AND 2002, INCOME TAX BENEFITS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSACTIONS OF

$25 MILLION, $5 MILLION AND $8 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, WERE ALLOCATED TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

IN 2004 THE COMPANY DERIVED TAX BENEFITS OF

$97 MILLION FROM AN EXCLUSION PROVIDED UNDER

U.S. INCOME TAX LAWS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN

EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO FOREIGN TRADING GROSS

RECEIPTS (FTGRS). THIS EXCLUSION WAS REPEALED AS

PART OF THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE

ACT), WHICH WAS ENACTED ON OCTOBER 22, 2004.

THE ACT PROVIDES FOR A PHASE-OUT SUCH THAT THE EXCLUSION FOR THE

COMPANYS OTHERWISE QUALIFYING FTGRS GENERATED IN FISCAL

2005, 2006 AND 2007 WILL BE LIMITED TO APPROXIMATELY 85%, 65%

AND 15%, RESPECTIVELY. NO EXCLUSION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN FISCAL

YEARS 2008 AND THEREAFTER.

-91-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ACT MAKES A NUMBER OF OTHER CHANGES TO THE

INCOME TAX LAWS WHICH WILL AFFECT THE COMPANY IN FUTURE YEARS,

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH IS A NEW DEDUCTION FOR QUALIFYING

DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE IMPACT OF THIS AND OTHER

CHANGES MADE BY THE ACT CANNOT BE QUANTIFIED AT THIS TIME.

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY

AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME

TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY REACHED A SETTLEMENT

WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE REGARDING ALL ASSESSMENTS

PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS FEDERAL INCOME TAX

RETURNS FOR 1993 THROUGH 1995. THIS SETTLEMENT RESULTED IN THE

COMPANY RELEASING $120 MILLION IN TAX RESERVES WHICH ARE NO

LONGER REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO THESE MATTERS. THIS RELEASE OF

RESERVES IS REFLECTED IN THE CURRENT YEAR INCOME TAX PROVISION.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY RESOLVED

CERTAIN STATE INCOME TAX AUDIT ISSUES AND THE CORRESPONDING

RELEASE OF $56 MILLION OF RELATED TAX RESERVES IS REFLECTED

IN THE 2003 INCOME TAX PROVISION.

PLAN FUNDED STATUS

AS A RESULT OF PENSION PLAN ASSET PERFORMANCE

BELOW EXPECTED RETURNS IN FISCAL 2002 AND 2003 AND A REDUCTION

IN THE DISCOUNT RATE OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, A NUMBER OF THE

COMPANYS PENSION PLANS WERE UNDERFUNDED AT

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, HAVING ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

EXCEEDING THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS. FOR THESE PLANS, THE

FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AGGREGATED $2.4 BILLION, THE

ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AGGREGATED $2.8 BILLION AND

THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AGGREGATED $3.0 BILLION.

AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION

LIABILITY ADJUSTMENTS OF $415 MILLION AND $969 MILLION

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2003,

RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN THE ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION

LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT OF $554 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FROM 5.85%

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 TO 6.30% AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004

AND IMPROVED PLAN ASSET PERFORMANCE. THIS DECREASE RESULTED IN

AN AFTER-TAX ADJUSTMENT OF $347 MILLION THAT WAS RECORDED

AS AN INCREASE OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY THROUGH ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN FISCAL 2004.

THE COMPANYS TOTAL ACCUMULATED PENSION

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 WERE $3.5 BILLION AND

$3.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH 95.2% AND 98.6%,

MULTI-EMPLOYER PLANS

THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN VARIOUS

MULTI-EMPLOYER PENSION PLANS UNDER UNION AND INDUSTRY-WIDE

AGREEMENTS. IN 2004, 2003, AND 2002, THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE

PLANS WHICH ARE GENERALLY EXPENSED AS INCURRED WERE

RESPECTIVELY.

ASSUMPTIONS

CERTAIN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS THE

DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN AND THE HEALTHCARE COST

TREND RATE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT AND NET PERIODIC PENSION EXPENSE

AS WELL AS THE RESPECTIVE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AMOUNTS.

DISCOUNT RATE  THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT

RATE FOR PENSION PLANS REPRESENTS THE MARKET RATE FOR

HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME INVESTMENTS OR A LONG-TERM HIGH

QUALITY CORPORATE BOND RATE. FOR 2004, WE INCREASED OUR RATE TO

6.30% TO REFLECT MARKET INTEREST RATE CONDITIONS.

LONG-TERM RETURN ON ASSETS  THE

ASSUMED RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF

LONG-TERM RETURNS ON AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTING OF A

MIXTURE OF EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME, AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST

RATE CHANGES PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS BORROWING ACTIVITIES. THE

COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST

RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND ON THE MARKET VALUE

OF ITS INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY,

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ITS FIXED RATE DEBT EXPRESSED AS A

PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM

PERCENTAGE.

THE COMPANY TYPICALLY USES PAY-FLOATING AND

PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO FACILITATE ITS INTEREST RATE

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. PAY-FLOATING SWAPS EFFECTIVELY

CONVERT FIXED RATE MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS TO VARIABLE

RATE INSTRUMENTS INDEXED TO LIBOR. SWAP AGREEMENTS IN PLACE AT

YEAR-END EXPIRE IN THREE TO 19 YEARS. PAY-FIXED SWAPS

EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS TO FIXED RATE

INSTRUMENTS. THE PAY-FIXED SWAPS IN PLACE AT YEAR-END EXPIRE IN

ONE TO EIGHT YEARS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003

RESPECTIVELY, THE COMPANY HELD $148 MILLION AND

$711 MILLION NOTIONAL VALUE OF PAY-FIXED SWAPS THAT DO NOT

QUALIFY AS HEDGES. THE CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES OF ALL SWAPS

THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS.

-99-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE IMPACT OF INEFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE RISK

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR FISCAL 2004, 2003

AND 2002. THE NET AMOUNT OF DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES IN AOCI

FROM INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT TRANSACTIONS AT

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 WAS A GAIN OF $10 MILLION WHILE THE

BALANCE AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 WAS IMMATERIAL.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY TRANSACTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND IS

SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND

CASH FLOW FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE

CHANGES THEREBY ENABLING MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON CORE

BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT

CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE

VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, FIRM

COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY USES OPTION STRATEGIES AND

FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY HEDGES A MINIMUM PERCENTAGE

(NOT TO EXCEED A MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE) OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS FOR PERIODS GENERALLY NOT TO EXCEED FIVE

YEARS. THE COMPANY USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN

CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FIRM COMMITMENTS. THE GAINS AND

LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR

EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED FORECASTED TRANSACTION, ASSET,

LIABILITY OR FIRM COMMITMENT. THE PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED

ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN AND CANADIAN DOLLAR.

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLARS.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON CONTRACTS HEDGING FORECASTED

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED TO AOCI,

AND RECLASSIFIED TO CURRENT EARNINGS WHEN SUCH TRANSACTIONS ARE

RECOGNIZED, OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003, THE

COMPANY HAD PRE-TAX DEFERRED GAINS OF $45 MILLION AND

$23 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND PRE-TAX DEFERRED LOSSES OF

$147 MILLION AND $203 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED

TO FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES ON FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSACTIONS.

DEFERRED AMOUNTS TO BE RECOGNIZED CHANGE WITH

MARKET CONDITIONS AND WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN

THE VALUE OF THE RELATED HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY

EXPECTS TO RECLASSIFY A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $88 MILLION FROM

AOCI TO EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. THE COMPANY

RECLASSIFIED AN AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $144 MILLION AND A

$62 MILLION AFTER-TAX GAIN FROM AOCI TO EARNINGS DURING

FISCAL 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THESE LOSSES WERE OFFSET BY

CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE ITEMS

BEING HEDGED.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003, CHANGES IN

VALUE RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES INCLUDED IN AOCI WERE A

PRE-TAX LOSS OF $102 MILLION AND $175 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED DEFERRED

LOSSES RELATED TO CERTAIN CASH FLOW HEDGES FROM AOCI TO

EARNINGS, DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE TIMING OF THE ORIGINAL

FORECASTED TRANSACTION. DURING FISCAL 2004 AND 2003, THE COMPANY

RECORDED THE CHANGE IN FAIR MARKET VALUE RELATED TO FAIR VALUE

HEDGES AND THE INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES TO

EARNINGS. THE AMOUNTS OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ON FAIR VALUE AND

CASH FLOW HEDGES WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR FISCAL 2004 AND FISCAL

2003. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES

ON OPERATING INCOME IN 2004 AND IN 2003 WAS A NET LOSS OF

$277 MILLION AND $273 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE

IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGES RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ON

OPERATING INCOME IN 2002 WAS A GAIN OF $44 MILLION.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003, THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED CASH, CASH

EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENTS, RECEIVABLES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE,

BORROWINGS AND INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003, THE FAIR

VALUES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS

WITH, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT

ARE COUNTERPARTIES TO ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DOES NOT

ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTIES.

THE COMPANY WOULD NOT REALIZE A MATERIAL LOSS AS

OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY

SINGLE COUNTERPARTY. THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS ONLY

WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A CREDIT

RATING OF A- OR BETTER. THE COMPANYS CURRENT POLICY

REGARDING AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES

IS GENERALLY TO REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT CREDIT RATINGS

FALL BELOW A- OR IN THE EVENT AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED LIMITS

AS DEFINED BY CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY LIMITS THE

AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, COUNTERPARTIES HAD PLEDGED A

TOTAL OF $37 MILLION OF CASH COLLATERAL.

THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES AND

INVESTMENTS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF

CREDIT RISK AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 DUE TO THE WIDE VARIETY

OF CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS INTO WHICH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS

ARE SOLD, THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS MANY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND THE

DIVERSIFICATION OF THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO AMONG ISSUERS.

PUBLIC PARKING FACILITY ADJACENT TO THE DISNEYLAND RESORT.

REVENUES FROM SALES, OCCUPANCY AND PROPERTY TAXES FROM THE

DISNEYLAND RESORT AND NON-DISNEY HOTELS ARE USED BY THE CITY OF

ANAHEIM TO REPAY THE BONDS. IN THE EVENT OF A DEBT SERVICE

SHORTFALL, THE COMPANY WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO FUND THE

SHORTFALL. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, THE REMAINING DEBT

SERVICE OBLIGATION GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY WAS

$402 MILLION, OF WHICH $109 MILLION WAS PRINCIPAL. TO

THE EXTENT THAT TAX REVENUES EXCEED THE DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS IN

SUBSEQUENT PERIODS, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REIMBURSED FOR ANY

PREVIOUSLY FUNDED SHORTFALLS.

TO DATE, TAX REVENUES HAVE EXCEEDED THE DEBT

SERVICE PAYMENTS FOR BOTH THE CELEBRATION AND ANAHEIM BONDS.

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT

DISNEY COMPANY.

IN THIS LAWSUIT, FILED

ON FEBRUARY 27, 1991 IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR

COURT, THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT A COMPANY SUBSIDIARY DEFRAUDED

IT AND BREACHED A 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO

CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH PROPERTIES, BY FAILING TO ACCOUNT FOR

AND PAY ROYALTIES ON REVENUES EARNED FROM THE SALE OF WINNIE THE

POOH MOVIES ON VIDEOCASSETTE AND FROM THE EXPLOITATION OF WINNIE

THE POOH MERCHANDISING RIGHTS. THE PLAINTIFF SEEKS DAMAGES FOR

THE LICENSEES ALLEGED BREACHES AS WELL AS CONFIRMATION OF

THE PLAINTIFFS INTERPRETATION OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT

WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE ACTIVITIES. THE PLAINTIFF ALSO SEEKS THE

RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT ON THE BASIS OF THE ALLEGED

BREACHES. IF EACH OF THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS WERE TO BE

CONFIRMED IN A FINAL JUDGMENT, DAMAGES AS ARGUED BY THE

PLAINTIFF COULD TOTAL AS MUCH AS SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE TO THE COMPANY OF ANY FUTURE

EXPLOITATION OF THE LICENSED RIGHTS. THE COMPANY DISPUTES THAT

THE PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER RELIEF OF ANY

KIND, INCLUDING TERMINATION OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT. ON

APRIL 24, 2003, THE MATTER WAS REMOVED TO THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, WHICH, ON

MAY 19, 2003, DISMISSED CERTAIN CLAIMS AND REMANDED THE

MATTER TO THE LOS ANGELES SUPERIOR COURT. THE COMPANY APPEALED

FROM THE DISTRICT COURTS ORDER TO THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR

THE NINTH CIRCUIT, BUT SERVED NOTICE THAT IT WAS WITHDRAWING ITS

APPEAL IN SEPTEMBER 2004. ON MARCH 29, 2004, THE SUPERIOR

COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION FOR TERMINATING

SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF FOR A HOST OF DISCOVERY ABUSES,

INCLUDING THE WITHHOLDING, ALTERATION, AND THEFT OF DOCUMENTS

AND OTHER INFORMATION, AND, ON APRIL 5, 2004, DISMISSED

PLAINTIFFS CASE WITH PREJUDICE. ON MAY 6, 2004, THE

PLAINTIFF MOVED TO DISQUALIFY THE JUDGE WHO ISSUED THE

MARCH 29, 2004 DECISION, AND ON MAY 13, 2004, THE

PLAINTIFF MOVED FOR A NEW TRIAL ON THE ISSUE OF THE

TERMINATING SANCTIONS. ON JULY 19, 2004, THE

PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO DISQUALIFY THE JUDGE WHO ISSUED THE

MARCH 29, 2004 DECISION WAS DENIED, AND ON AUGUST 2,

2004, THE PLAINTIFF FILED WITH THE STATE COURT OF APPEAL A

PETITION FOR A WRIT OF MANDATE TO CHALLENGE THE DENIAL, WHICH

WAS ALSO DENIED. IN SEPTEMBER 2004, PLAINTIFFS MOVED A SECOND

TIME TO DISQUALIFY THE TRIAL JUDGE. THAT MOTION IS PENDING.

MILNE AND DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. V.

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC.

ON

NOVEMBER 5, 2002, CLARE MILNE, THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A. A.

MILNE, AUTHOR OF THE WINNIE THE POOH BOOKS, AND THE

COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. FILED A

COMPLAINT AGAINST STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. (SSI) IN

THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF

CALIFORNIA. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2002, MS. MILNE SERVED

NOTICES TO SSI AND THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY TERMINATING A.

A. MILNES PRIOR GRANT OF RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH,

EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004, AND GRANTED ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS

TO THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY. IN THEIR LAWSUIT,

MS. MILNE AND THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY SEEK A

DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, UNDER UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT LAW, THAT

MS. MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE VALID; THAT

SSIS RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH IN THE UNITED STATES

TERMINATED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004; THAT UPON

TERMINATION OF SSIS RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 1983

LICENSING AGREEMENT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE

STEPHEN

SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

LAWSUIT

TERMINATED BY OPERATION OF LAW; AND THAT, AS OF NOVEMBER 5,

2004, SSI WAS ENTITLED TO NO FURTHER ROYALTIES FOR USES OF

WINNIE THE POOH. IN JANUARY 2003, SSI FILED (A) AN ANSWER

DENYING THE MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT AND

(B) COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT

(I) MS. MILNES GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DISNEY

ENTERPRISES, INC. IS VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE AND (II) DISNEY

ENTERPRISES, INC. REMAINS OBLIGATED TO PAY SSI ROYALTIES UNDER

THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT. SSI ALSO FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS

THE COMPLAINT OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. ON

MAY 8, 2003, THE COURT RULED THAT MILNES TERMINATION

NOTICES ARE INVALID AND DISMISSED SSIS COUNTERCLAIMS AS

MOOT. FOLLOWING FURTHER MOTIONS, ON AUGUST 1, 2003, SSI

FILED AN AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS AND A THIRD-PARTY

COMPLAINT AGAINST HARRIET HUNT (HEIR TO E. H. SHEPARD,

ILLUSTRATOR OF THE ORIGINAL WINNIE THE POOH STORIES), WHO HAD

SERVED A NOTICE OF TERMINATION AND A GRANT OF RIGHTS SIMILAR TO

MS. MILNES. BY ORDER DATED OCTOBER 27, 2003, THE

COURT CERTIFIED AN INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL FROM ITS MAY 8 ORDER TO

THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT, BUT ON

JANUARY 15, 2004, THE COURT OF APPEALS DENIED THE

COMPANYS AND MILNES PETITION FOR AN INTERLOCUTORY

APPEAL. BY ORDER DATED AUGUST 3, 2004, THE COURT GRANTED

SSI LEAVE TO AMEND ITS ANSWER TO ASSERT COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST

THE COMPANY ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE MILNE AND HUNT

TERMINATIONS AND THE GRANT OF RIGHTS TO THE COMPANYS

SUBSIDIARY FOR (A) UNLAWFUL AND UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES;

-103-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND (B) BREACH OF THE 1983 LICENSING

AGREEMENT. IN OCTOBER 2004, MILNE, JOINED BY THE COMPANY, MOVED

TO AMEND ITS COMPLAINT TO DISMISS ITS CLAIM AGAINST SSI FOR THE

PURPOSE OF OBTAINING A FINAL ORDER OF DISMISSAL AGAINST IT, SO

AS TO PERMIT ITS APPEAL TO THE COURT OF APPEALS TO PROCEED, AND

THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THAT MOTION BY ORDER DATED

NOVEMBER 12, 2004.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT CURRENTLY

POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT IF ANY, THAT THE ULTIMATE

RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES,

CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR

CO-DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS INVOLVING COPYRIGHT,

BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE

CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE

COMPANY TO SUFFER ANY MATERIAL LIABILITY BY REASON OF SUCH

ACTIONS.

RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES

ON NOVEMBER 21, 2004, THE COMPANY SOLD

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DISNEY STORE CHAIN IN NORTH AMERICA

UNDER A LONG-TERM LICENSING ARRANGEMENT TO A WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF THE CHILDRENS PLACE (TCP).

PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE SALE, THE DISNEY STORE NORTH

AMERICA WILL RETAIN ITS LEASE OBLIGATION AND WILL BECOME A

WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TCP. TCP WILL PAY THE COMPANY A

ROYALTY ON THE PHYSICAL RETAIL STORE SALES BEGINNING ON THE

SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE OF THE SALE.

DURING THE YEAR, THE COMPANY RECORDED

$64 MILLION OF RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED

TO THE DISNEY STORE. THE BULK OF THE CHARGE ($50 MILLION)

WAS AN IMPAIRMENT OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE FIXED ASSETS

RELATED TO THE STORES TO BE SOLD WHICH WAS RECORDED IN THE THIRD

QUARTER BASED ON THE TERMS OF THE SALE. ADDITIONAL CHARGES

RECORDED DURING THE YEAR RELATED TO THE CLOSURE OF STORES THAT

WOULD NOT BE SOLD AND TO TRANSACTION COSTS RELATED TO THE SALE.

ADDITIONAL CHARGES FOR WORKING CAPITAL AND OTHER

ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE EXPENSED AT THE DATE OF CLOSING. ADDITIONAL

RESTRUCTURING COSTS WILL ALSO BE RECOGNIZED LATER IN FISCAL

2005. WE EXPECT THAT THE TOTAL COSTS THAT WILL BE RECORDED IN

FISCAL 2005 WILL RANGE FROM $40 MILLION TO $50 MILLION.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING OPTIONS WITH

RESPECT TO THE STORES IN EUROPE, INCLUDING A POTENTIAL SALE. THE

CARRYING VALUE OF THE FIXED AND OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS OF THE

CHAIN IN EUROPE TOTALED $36 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30,

2004. DEPENDING ON THE TERMS OF A SALE, AN IMPAIRMENT OF THESE

ASSETS IS POSSIBLE. THE BASE RENT LEASE OBLIGATIONS FOR THE

CHAIN IN EUROPE TOTALED $206 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30,

2004.
