5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF NETWORKS DISTRIBUTED BY MVPDS HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FOR ADVERTISING REVENUES FOR OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS. THE COMPANY’S CABLE NETWORKS ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER CABLE NETWORKS FOR CARRIAGE BY MVPDS. THE COMPANY’S CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH MVPDS ARE RENEWED OR RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE CABLE AND SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS VARIOUS CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE.

THE COMPANY’S MEDIA NETWORKS BUSINESSES ALSO COMPETE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING. THE MARKET FOR PROGRAMMING IS VERY COMPETITIVE, PARTICULARLY FOR LIVE SPORTS PROGRAMMING. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS SPORTS RIGHTS AGREEMENTS WITH THE NFL, COLLEGE FOOTBALL (INCLUDING BOWL GAMES AND THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL PLAYOFF) AND BASKETBALL, MLB, NBA, THE WIMBLEDON CHAMPIONSHIPS, US OPEN TENNIS, SOCCER AND THE MASTERS GOLF TOURNAMENT.

THE COMPANY’S INTERNET WEBSITES AND DIGITAL PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH OTHER WEBSITES AND ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS.

ADVERTISING REVENUES AT MEDIA NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE FEES ARE COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

FEDERAL REGULATION

TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) UNDER FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. VIOLATION OF FCC REGULATIONS CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY FORFEITURES, LIMITED RENEWALS OF LICENSES AND, IN EGREGIOUS CASES, DENIAL OF LICENSE RENEWAL OR REVOCATION OF A LICENSE. FCC REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

•

LICENSING OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS.

EACH OF THE TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE OWN MUST BE LICENSED BY THE FCC. THESE LICENSES ARE GRANTED FOR PERIODS OF UP TO EIGHT YEARS, AND WE MUST OBTAIN RENEWAL OF LICENSES AS THEY EXPIRE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OPERATING THE STATIONS. WE (AND THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN THE CASE OF A DIVESTITURE) MUST ALSO OBTAIN FCC APPROVAL WHENEVER WE SEEK TO HAVE A LICENSE TRANSFERRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OR DIVESTITURE OF A STATION. THE FCC MAY DECLINE TO RENEW OR APPROVE THE TRANSFER OF A LICENSE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND MAY DELAY RENEWALS WHILE PERMITTING A LICENSEE TO CONTINUE OPERATING. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE RECEIVED SUCH RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE PAST OR HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS WHEN RENEWAL IS DELAYED, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL BE THE CASE IN THE FUTURE.

•

TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP LIMITS.

THE FCC IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SPECIFIC MARKET, ON THE COMBINED NUMBER OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SINGLE MARKET AND ON THE AGGREGATE PERCENTAGE OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE THAT CAN BE REACHED BY TELEVISION STATIONS WE OWN. CURRENTLY.

▪

FCC REGULATIONS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN A MARKET, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND NATURE OF THE MARKET. WE DO NOT OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN ANY MARKET.

▪

FEDERAL STATUTES PERMIT OUR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE AGGREGATE TO REACH A MAXIMUM OF 39% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE (FOR THIS PURPOSE, FCC REGULATIONS ATTRIBUTE UHF TELEVISION STATIONS WITH 50% OF THE TELEVISION HOUSEHOLDS IN THEIR MARKET). FOR PURPOSES OF THE FCC’S RULES, OUR EIGHT STATIONS REACH APPROXIMATELY 21% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE. ALTHOUGH THE FCC HAS AN OPEN RULEMAKING ON WHETHER TO REPEAL OR REVISE THE UHF DISCOUNT, THE OUTCOME OF THAT RULEMAKING WOULD NOT AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS BECAUSE OUR EIGHT STATIONS WOULD ONLY BE DEEMED TO REACH APPROXIMATELY 23% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE IF THE UHF DISCOUNT DID NOT APPLY.

▪

FCC REGULATIONS IN SOME CASES IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL RADIO OR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN RADIO STATIONS, BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS ARE MATERIAL TO OUR CURRENT OPERATING PLANS.

•

DUAL NETWORKS.

FCC RULES CURRENTLY PROHIBIT ANY OF THE FOUR MAJOR BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS — ABC, CBS, FOX AND NBC — FROM BEING UNDER COMMON OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.

•

REGULATION OF PROGRAMMING.

THE FCC REGULATES BROADCAST PROGRAMMING BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BANNING “INDECENT” PROGRAMMING, REGULATING POLITICAL ADVERTISING AND IMPOSING COMMERCIAL TIME LIMITS DURING CHILDREN’S PROGRAMMING. PENALTIES FOR BROADCASTING INDECENT PROGRAMMING CAN RANGE UP TO $350,000 PER INDECENT UTTERANCE OR IMAGE PER STATION.

FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND FCC RULES ALSO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL MATTER THAT MAY BE SHOWN ON BROADCAST OR CABLE CHANNELS DURING PROGRAMMING DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN 12 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. IN ADDITION, BROADCAST CHANNELS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF THREE HOURS PER WEEK OF PROGRAMMING THAT HAS AS A “SIGNIFICANT PURPOSE” MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN 16 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. FCC RULES ALSO GIVE

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TELEVISION STATION OWNERS THE RIGHT TO REJECT OR REFUSE NETWORK PROGRAMMING IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO SUBSTITUTE PROGRAMMING THAT THE LICENSEE REASONABLY BELIEVES TO BE OF GREATER LOCAL OR NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.

•

CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

FOR AN ENTERPRISE AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS THE COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS AFFECTING SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPERATIONS IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THESE OPERATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

CHANGES IN U.S., GLOBAL, OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES.

A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, THUS REDUCING OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS. PAST DECLINES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REDUCED SPENDING AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS, PURCHASE OF AND PRICES FOR ADVERTISING ON OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND OWNED STATIONS, PERFORMANCE OF OUR HOME ENTERTAINMENT RELEASES, AND PURCHASES OF COMPANY-BRANDED CONSUMER PRODUCTS, AND SIMILAR IMPACTS CAN BE EXPECTED SHOULD SUCH CONDITIONS RECUR. A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO REDUCE ATTENDANCE AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS, PRICES THAT MVPDS PAY FOR OUR CABLE PROGRAMMING OR SUBSCRIPTION LEVELS FOR OUR CABLE PROGRAMMING. RECENT INSTABILITY IN NON-U.S. ECONOMIES HAS HAD SIMILAR IMPACTS ON SOME OF OUR U.S. OPERATIONS. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CAN ALSO IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THOSE WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS TO SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN PRICE LEVELS GENERALLY, OR IN PRICE LEVELS IN A PARTICULAR SECTOR SUCH AS THE ENERGY SECTOR, COULD RESULT IN A SHIFT IN CONSUMER DEMAND AWAY FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS WE OFFER, WHICH COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASE OUR COSTS. CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY REDUCE INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS OR INCREASE OUR LABOR OR SUPPLY COSTS IN NON-U.S. MARKETS, AND RECENT CHANGES HAVE REDUCED THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF REVENUE WE RECEIVE AND EXPECT TO RECEIVE FROM OTHER MARKETS. ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN A COUNTRY COULD ALSO REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COUNTRY OR OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE REVENUE FROM THE COUNTRY.

CHANGES IN PUBLIC AND CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES CREATE ENTERTAINMENT, TRAVEL AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS WHOSE SUCCESS DEPENDS SUBSTANTIALLY ON CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES THAT CHANGE IN OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO CONSISTENTLY CREATE AND DISTRIBUTE FILMED ENTERTAINMENT, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ONLINE MATERIAL, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, HOTELS AND OTHER RESORT FACILITIES AND TRAVEL EXPERIENCES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE CHANGING PREFERENCES OF THE BROAD CONSUMER MARKET AND RESPOND TO COMPETITION FROM AN EXPANDING ARRAY OF CHOICES FACILITATED BY TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DELIVERY OF CONTENT. MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON ACCEPTANCE OF OUR OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS BY CONSUMERS OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND THEIR SUCCESS THEREFORE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT AND ADAPT TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES OUTSIDE AS WELL AS INSIDE THE U.S. MOREOVER, WE MUST OFTEN INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN FILM PRODUCTION, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, CRUISE SHIPS OR HOTELS AND OTHER RESORT FACILITIES BEFORE WE LEARN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PRODUCTS WILL EARN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. IF OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, OUR REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING SALES (WHICH ARE BASED IN PART ON RATINGS FOR THE PROGRAMS IN WHICH ADVERTISEMENTS AIR) OR SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING AND ONLINE SERVICES, FROM THEATRICAL FILM RECEIPTS OR HOME ENTERTAINMENT OR ELECTRONIC GAME SALES, FROM THEME PARK ADMISSIONS, HOTEL ROOM CHARGES AND MERCHANDISE, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES, FROM SALES OF LICENSED CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR FROM SALES OF OUR OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY DECLINE OR FAIL TO GROW TO THE EXTENT WE ANTICIPATE WHEN MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES.

CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND IN CONSUMER CONSUMPTION PATTERNS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, THE REVENUE WE CAN GENERATE FROM THESE PRODUCTS OR THE COST OF PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTS.

THE MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT AND INTERNET BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY ADAPT TO SHIFTING PATTERNS OF CONTENT CONSUMPTION THROUGH THE ADOPTION AND EXPLOITATION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. NEW TECHNOLOGIES AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THE MANNER IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO CONSUMERS, THE SOURCES AND NATURE OF COMPETING CONTENT OFFERINGS, THE TIME AND MANNER IN WHICH CONSUMERS ACQUIRE AND VIEW SOME OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO ADVERTISERS FOR REACHING THEIR DESIRED AUDIENCES. THIS TREND HAS IMPACTED THE BUSINESS MODEL FOR CERTAIN TRADITIONAL FORMS OF DISTRIBUTION, AS EVIDENCED BY THE INDUSTRY-WIDE DECLINE IN RATINGS FOR BROADCAST TELEVISION, THE REDUCTION IN DEMAND FOR HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES OF THEATRICAL CONTENT, THE DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS FOR BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING AND DECLINES IN SUBSCRIBER LEVELS FOR CERTAIN OF OUR NETWORKS. IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ALTER OUR BUSINESS MODELS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCESSFULLY RESPOND TO THESE CHANGES, THAT WE WILL NOT EXPERIENCE DISRUPTION AS WE DEVELOP RESPONSES TO THE CHANGES, OR THAT THE BUSINESS MODELS WE DEVELOP WILL BE AS PROFITABLE AS OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODELS. AS A RESULT, THE INCOME FROM OUR

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS MAY DECLINE OR INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OR OUR EXPECTATIONS WHEN WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCTS.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE EXISTENCE AND MAINTENANCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE CREATE.

THE VALUE TO US OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF OUR RIGHTS AS DEFINED BY APPLICABLE LAWS IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THOSE LAWS ARE CONSTRUED. IF THOSE LAWS ARE DRAFTED OR INTERPRETED IN WAYS THAT LIMIT THE EXTENT OR DURATION OF OUR RIGHTS, OR IF EXISTING LAWS ARE CHANGED, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY DECREASE, OR THE COST OF OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE.

THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF PROTECTING THESE RIGHTS OR REDUCE OUR REVENUES. NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION, AND ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES, THE FALLING PRICES OF DEVICES INCORPORATING SUCH TECHNOLOGIES, INCREASED BROADBAND INTERNET SPEED AND PENETRATION AND INCREASED AVAILABILITY AND SPEED OF MOBILE DATA TRANSMISSION HAVE MADE THE UNAUTHORIZED DIGITAL COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR FILMS, TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND OTHER CREATIVE WORKS EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MORE CHALLENGING. THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY GENERALLY CONTINUES TO BE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS HOLDERS. INADEQUATE LAWS OR WEAK ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN ONE COUNTRY CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE, DESPITE THE COMPANY’S EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THESE DEVELOPMENTS REQUIRE US TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST UNLICENSED USE AND PRESENT THE RISK OF INCREASED LOSSES OF REVENUE AS A RESULT OF UNLICENSED DISTRIBUTION OF OUR CONTENT.

WITH RESPECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE COMPANY AND RIGHTS ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY FROM OTHERS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF CHALLENGES TO OUR COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK AND PATENT RIGHTS BY THIRD PARTIES. SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGES TO OUR RIGHTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS FOR OBTAINING RIGHTS OR THE LOSS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN REVENUE FROM THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF CHALLENGED RIGHTS.

PROTECTION OF ELECTRONICALLY STORED DATA IS COSTLY AND IF OUR DATA IS COMPROMISED IN SPITE OF THIS PROTECTION, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS, LOST OPPORTUNITIES AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

WE MAINTAIN INFORMATION NECESSARY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AS WELL AS PERSONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES, IN DIGITAL FORM. DATA MAINTAINED IN DIGITAL FORM IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF INTRUSION, TAMPERING AND THEFT. WE DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SYSTEMS IN AN EFFORT TO PREVENT INTRUSION, TAMPERING AND THEFT, BUT THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS IS COSTLY AND REQUIRES ONGOING MONITORING AND UPDATING AS TECHNOLOGIES CHANGE AND EFFORTS TO OVERCOME SECURITY MEASURES BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED. ACCORDINGLY, DESPITE OUR EFFORTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF INTRUSION, TAMPERING AND THEFT CANNOT BE ELIMINATED ENTIRELY, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE REMAIN. IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE CONFIDENTIAL, PROPRIETARY AND PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. WHILE WE OBTAIN ASSURANCES THAT THESE THIRD PARTIES WILL PROTECT THIS INFORMATION AND, WHERE WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATE, MONITOR THE PROTECTIONS EMPLOYED BY THESE THIRD PARTIES, THERE IS A RISK THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES MAY BE COMPROMISED. IF OUR DATA SYSTEMS ARE COMPROMISED, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS MAY BE IMPAIRED, WE MAY LOSE PROFITABLE OPPORTUNITIES OR THE VALUE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES MAY BE DIMINISHED AND, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE MAY LOSE REVENUE AS A RESULT OF UNLICENSED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. IF PERSONAL INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES IS MISAPPROPRIATED, OUR REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES MAY BE INJURED RESULTING IN LOSS OF BUSINESS OR MORALE, AND WE MAY INCUR COSTS TO REMEDIATE POSSIBLE INJURY TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES OR TO PAY FINES OR TAKE OTHER ACTION WITH RESPECT TO JUDICIAL OR REGULATORY ACTIONS ARISING OUT OF THE INCIDENT.

A VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR INCREASE THE COST OF PROVIDING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PARTICULARLY OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS, IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM. THE ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM, AS WELL AS DEMAND FOR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE U.S., GLOBALLY OR IN SPECIFIC REGIONS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING: ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARISING FROM SHORT-TERM WEATHER PATTERNS OR LONG-TERM CHANGE, CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR NATURAL DISASTERS (SUCH AS EXCESSIVE HEAT OR RAIN, HURRICANES, TYPHOONS, FLOODS, TSUNAMIS AND EARTHQUAKES); HEALTH CONCERNS; INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL OR MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS; AND TERRORIST ATTACKS. THESE EVENTS AND OTHERS, SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN TRAVEL AND ENERGY COSTS AND COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACKS, INTRUSIONS OR OTHER WIDESPREAD COMPUTING OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, MAY ALSO DAMAGE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THESE EVENTS. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE ROYALTIES FROM THE SALES OF OUR LICENSED GOODS AND SERVICES BY THIRD PARTIES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESSES OPERATED UNDER BRANDS LICENSED FROM THE COMPANY, AND WE ARE THEREFORE DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESSES OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES FOR THAT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE. A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS COULD INFLUENCE THE SUCCESS OF THOSE

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THIRD PARTIES AND IF NEGATIVE FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF OUR LICENSEES, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE OBTAIN INSURANCE AGAINST THE RISK OF LOSSES RELATING TO SOME OF THESE EVENTS, GENERALLY INCLUDING PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO OUR PROPERTY AND RESULTING BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, CERTAIN INJURIES OCCURRING ON OUR PROPERTY AND SOME LIABILITIES FOR ALLEGED BREACH OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WHEN INSURANCE IS OBTAINED IT IS SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES, EXCLUSIONS, TERMS, CONDITIONS AND LIMITS OF LIABILITY. THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF COVERAGE WE OBTAIN VARY FROM TIME TO TIME DEPENDING ON OUR VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SPECIFIC TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS IN RELATION TO THE COST OF OBTAINING COVERAGE FOR SUCH TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS.

CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS OR OTHERWISE AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OCCUR WE MAY NEED TO ADJUST OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES TO MEET THESE CHANGES OR WE MAY OTHERWISE FIND IT NECESSARY TO RESTRUCTURE OUR OPERATIONS OR PARTICULAR BUSINESSES OR ASSETS. IN ADDITION, EXTERNAL EVENTS INCLUDING ACCEPTANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL OFFERINGS AND CHANGES IN MACROECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS. WHEN THESE CHANGES OR EVENTS OCCUR, WE MAY INCUR COSTS TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND MAY NEED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF ASSETS. WE ALSO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING OR NEW BUSINESSES, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS AND IN NEW BUSINESS LINES. IN RECENT YEARS, SUCH INVESTMENTS HAVE INCLUDED EXPANSION AND RENOVATION OF CERTAIN OF OUR THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS AND INVESTMENT IN SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT. SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS MAY HAVE SHORT-TERM RETURNS THAT ARE NEGATIVE OR LOW AND THE ULTIMATE BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES MAY BE UNCERTAIN. IN ANY OF THESE EVENTS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE, WE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS OR RETURNS ON NEW INVESTMENTS MAY BE LOWER THAN PRIOR TO THE CHANGE IN STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING.

TURMOIL IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND IMPEDE ACCESS TO OR INCREASE THE COST OF FINANCING OUR OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS.

PAST DISRUPTIONS IN THE U.S. AND GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY BUSINESSES TO OBTAIN FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. THESE CONDITIONS TENDED TO INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING AND IF THEY RECUR, OUR COST OF BORROWING COULD INCREASE AND IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES THAT ARE BASED, IN PART, ON THE COMPANY’S PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. A DECREASE IN THESE RATINGS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING. PAST DISRUPTIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS ALSO IMPACTED SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. A SIMILAR DECLINE IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SECURE CREDIT-WORTHY COUNTERPARTIES FOR OUR INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING PROGRAMS AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SETTLE EXISTING CONTRACTS.

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES FROM ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER AND FROM OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO MUST COMPETE TO OBTAIN HUMAN RESOURCES, PROGRAMMING AND OTHER RESOURCES WE REQUIRE IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE.

•

OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS, STATIONS AND ONLINE OFFERINGS COMPETE FOR VIEWERS WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES AS WELL AS WITH HOME ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, NEW SOURCES OF BROADBAND DELIVERED CONTENT AND INTERNET USAGE.

•

OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND STATIONS COMPETE FOR THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES, AND INTERNET DELIVERED CONTENT, AS WELL AS WITH NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, BILLBOARDS AND RADIO STATIONS.

•

OUR CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR CARRIAGE OF THEIR PROGRAMMING WITH OTHER PROGRAMMING PROVIDERS.

•

OUR STUDIO OPERATIONS, BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE TO OBTAIN CREATIVE AND PERFORMING TALENT, SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING, STORY PROPERTIES, ADVERTISER SUPPORT AND MARKET SHARE WITH OTHER STUDIO OPERATIONS, BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND NEW SOURCES OF BROADBAND DELIVERED CONTENT.

•

OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS COMPETE FOR GUESTS WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATION ACTIVITIES.

•

OUR STUDIO OPERATIONS COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT.

•

OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT COMPETES WITH OTHER LICENSORS, PUBLISHERS AND RETAILERS OF CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES.

•

OUR INTERACTIVE MEDIA OPERATIONS COMPETE WITH OTHER PUBLISHERS OF CONSOLE, ONLINE AND MOBILE GAMES AND OTHER TYPES OF HOME ENTERTAINMENT.

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITION IN EACH OF THESE AREAS MAY INCREASE AS A RESULT OF TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND CHANGES IN MARKET STRUCTURE, INCLUDING CONSOLIDATION OF SUPPLIERS OF RESOURCES AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. INCREASED COMPETITION MAY DIVERT CONSUMERS FROM OUR CREATIVE OR OTHER PRODUCTS, OR TO OTHER PRODUCTS OR OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR MARKETING COSTS. SUCH COMPETITION MAY ALSO REDUCE, OR LIMIT GROWTH IN, PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING ADVERTISING RATES AND SUBSCRIPTION FEES AT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS, PARKS AND RESORTS ADMISSIONS AND ROOM RATES, AND PRICES FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS FROM WHICH WE DERIVE LICENSE REVENUES. COMPETITION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF RESOURCES CAN INCREASE THE COST OF PRODUCING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

SUSTAINED INCREASES IN COSTS OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND OTHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

WITH APPROXIMATELY

185,000

EMPLOYEES, OUR PROFITABILITY IS SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED BY COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS AND CURRENT AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. WE MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THESE COSTS AS A RESULT OF MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING INCREASES IN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN INVESTMENT RETURNS AND DISCOUNT RATES USED TO CALCULATE PENSION EXPENSE AND RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE VOLATILE AND MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS IN SOME YEARS. THESE MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AS WELL AS A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ASSETS MAY PUT UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS AND MAY INCREASE FUTURE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE COULD REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF LONG-TERM PROGRAMMING OR CARRIAGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT RENEWED ON SUFFICIENTLY FAVORABLE TERMS.

WE ENTER INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR BOTH THE ACQUISITION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS FOR SPORTING EVENTS AND OTHER PROGRAMS, AND CONTRACTS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PROGRAMMING TO CONTENT DISTRIBUTORS. AS THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRE, WE MUST RENEW OR RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RENEW THEM ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY LOSE PROGRAMMING RIGHTS OR DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS. EVEN IF THESE CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED, THE COST OF OBTAINING PROGRAMMING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE (OR INCREASE AT FASTER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE) OR PROGRAMMING DISTRIBUTORS, FACING PRESSURES RESULTING FROM INCREASED SUBSCRIPTION FEES AND ALTERNATIVE DISTRIBUTION CHALLENGES, MAY DEMAND TERMS (INCLUDING PRICING AND THE BREADTH OF DISTRIBUTION) THAT REDUCE OUR REVENUE FROM DISTRIBUTION OF PROGRAMS (OR INCREASE REVENUE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE). WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, THE IMPACT OF THESE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS ON OUR RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT REVENUES FROM PROGRAMMING BASED ON THESE RIGHTS WILL EXCEED THE COST OF THE RIGHTS PLUS THE OTHER COSTS OF PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAMMING.

CHANGES IN REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES MAY IMPAIR THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BROADCAST NETWORKS AND TELEVISION STATIONS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED, AND EACH OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF U.S. AND OVERSEAS REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATIONS INCLUDE.

•

U.S. FCC REGULATION OF OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO NETWORKS, OUR NATIONAL PROGRAMMING NETWORKS, AND OUR OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS. SEE ITEM 1 — BUSINESS — MEDIA NETWORKS, FEDERAL REGULATION.

•

FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

•

REGULATION OF THE SAFETY OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND THEME PARK OPERATIONS.

•

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION REGULATIONS.

•

IMPOSITION BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES OF TRADE RESTRICTIONS, RESTRICTIONS ON THE MANNER IN WHICH CONTENT IS CURRENTLY LICENSED AND DISTRIBUTED, OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS OR MOTION PICTURE OR TELEVISION CONTENT REQUIREMENTS OR QUOTAS.

•

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL WAGE LAWS, TAX LAWS OR CURRENCY CONTROLS.

CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE REGULATIONS OR REGULATORY ACTIVITIES IN ANY OF THESE AREAS MAY REQUIRE US TO SPEND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS, OR MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN WAYS THAT ARE PROFITABLE.

OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OPERATION OF LAWS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.

OUR OPERATIONS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS ARE IN MANY CASES SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE RATHER THAN U.S. LAW. LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS DIFFER IN SIGNIFICANT RESPECTS FROM THOSE IN THE U.S., AND THESE DIFFERENCES CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REACT TO CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND OUR RIGHTS OR ABILITY TO ENFORCE RIGHTS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN WOULD BE

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXPECTED UNDER U.S. LAW. MOREOVER, ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS IN SOME OVERSEAS JURISDICTIONS CAN BE INCONSISTENT AND UNPREDICTABLE, WHICH CAN AFFECT BOTH OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS AND TO UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE BENEFICIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE BUSINESS AND POLITICAL CLIMATE IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY ENCOURAGE CORRUPTION, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS WHILE REMAINING IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS OR UNITED STATES ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE AND OUR EXPENSES IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS MAY DIFFER FROM WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED IF U.S. LAW GOVERNED THESE OPERATIONS.

LABOR DISPUTES MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN VARIOUS OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS AS WELL AS WRITERS, DIRECTORS, ACTORS, PRODUCTION PERSONNEL AND OTHERS EMPLOYED IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS AND STUDIO OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE EMPLOYEES OF LICENSEES WHO MANUFACTURE AND RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS, AND EMPLOYEES OF PROVIDERS OF PROGRAMMING CONTENT (SUCH AS SPORTS LEAGUES) MAY BE COVERED BY LABOR AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS. IN GENERAL, A LABOR DISPUTE INVOLVING OUR EMPLOYEES OR THE EMPLOYEES OF OUR LICENSEES OR RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR PROVIDERS OF PROGRAMMING CONTENT MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUES, AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS.

THE SEASONALITY OF CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES COULD EXACERBATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES IS NORMALLY SUBJECT TO SEASONAL VARIATIONS, AS FOLLOWS.

•

REVENUES IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. IN GENERAL, ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE FEES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR.

•

REVENUES IN OUR PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY RESULTING FROM THE SEASONAL NATURE OF VACATION TRAVEL AND LEISURE ACTIVITIES. PEAK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY GENERALLY OCCUR DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN SCHOOL VACATIONS OCCUR AND DURING EARLY-WINTER AND SPRING-HOLIDAY PERIODS.

•

REVENUES IN OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND TELEVISION MARKETS. RELEASE DATES ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS.

•

REVENUES IN OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND INTERACTIVE MEDIA SEGMENTS ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUES DURING THE COMPANY’S FIRST FISCAL QUARTER, AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF THEATRICAL RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS.

ACCORDINGLY, IF A SHORT-TERM NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OCCURS DURING A TIME OF HIGH SEASONAL DEMAND (SUCH AS HURRICANE DAMAGE TO OUR PARKS DURING THE SUMMER TRAVEL SEASON), THE EFFECT COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF THAT BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR.

. THE EPS INCREASE IN FISCAL 2015 REFLECTED IMPROVED OPERATING PERFORMANCE AND A DECREASE IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING AS A RESULT OF OUR SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE WRITE-OFF OF A DEFERRED TAX ASSET (DISCUSSED BELOW) AND LOWER INVESTMENT GAINS. THE CURRENT YEAR RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE THE BENEFIT FROM A FIFTY-THIRD WEEK OF OPERATIONS DUE TO THE TIMING OF OUR FISCAL PERIOD END. FISCAL 2016 WILL INCLUDE FIFTY-TWO WEEKS OF OPERATIONS.

REVENUES

SERVICE REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2015 INCREASED

9%

, OR $3.7 BILLION, TO

$43.9 BILLION

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER MVPD FEES (AFFILIATE FEES), VOLUME GROWTH AND HIGHER AVERAGE GUEST SPENDING AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS, HIGHER SVOD SALES OF OUR TELEVISION AND FILM PROPERTIES, AN INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE LICENSING AND ADVERTISING REVENUE GROWTH. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN ADVERSE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR CURRENCIES.

PRODUCT REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2015 WERE COMPARABLE TO THE PRIOR YEAR AS HIGHER FOOD, BEVERAGE AND MERCHANDISE VOLUMES AND AVERAGE GUEST SPENDING AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS AND INCREASED REVENUES AT OUR RETAIL BUSINESS WERE OFFSET BY LOWER WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSOLE GAME VOLUMES AND AN ADVERSE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR CURRENCIES.

COST OF PRODUCTS FOR FISCAL 2015 INCREASED

2%

, OR $109 MILLION, TO

$5.2 BILLION

DRIVEN BY VOLUME GROWTH AT DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS AND OUR RETAIL BUSINESS AND INFLATION AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSOLE GAME UNIT SALES AND THE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR CURRENCIES.

SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS WERE COMPARABLE TO THE PRIOR YEAR AS HIGHER LABOR COSTS DRIVEN BY THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, ESPN AND CORPORATE AND HIGHER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COSTS AT DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS WERE OFFSET BY LOWER MARKETING COSTS AND THE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR CURRENCIES. THE DECREASE IN MARKETING COSTS WAS DUE TO LOWER SPENDING FOR THEATRICAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES AT ABC, ESPN AND OUR MERCHANDISE LICENSING BUSINESS.

THE INCREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A WRITE-OFF OF A $399 MILLION DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSET AS A RESULT OF THE INCREASE IN THE COMPANY’S OWNERSHIP OF EURO DISNEY S.C.A. IN CONNECTION WITH THE DISNEYLAND PARIS RECAPITALIZATION. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A BENEFIT FROM AN INCREASE IN EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN OPERATIONS INDEFINITELY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO TAX RATES LOWER THAN THE FEDERAL STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE.

THE 5% DECREASE IN THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION REVENUE WAS DUE TO UNFAVORABLE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACTS DRIVEN BY THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR CURRENCIES AND THE IMPACT OF HAVING NO DREAMWORKS TITLES IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO FOUR IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PERFORMANCE OF

INSIDE OUT

AND

BIG HERO 6

IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO

FROZEN

AND

PLANES: FIRE AND RESCUE

IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AS WELL AS ONE ADDITIONAL DISNEY LIVE-ACTION RELEASE IN THE CURRENT YEAR. SIGNIFICANT DISNEY LIVE-ACTION RELEASES IN THE CURRENT YEAR INCLUDED

AND

INTO THE WOODS

, WHEREAS THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED

ANT-MAN

IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS COMPARABLE TO THE PRIOR-YEAR PERFORMANCE OF MARVEL’S

GUARDIANS OF THE GALAXY

, MARVEL’S

CAPTAIN AMERICA: THE WINTER SOLDIER

AND MARVEL’S

THOR: THE DARK WORLD.

THE 14% DECREASE IN HOME ENTERTAINMENT REVENUE WAS DUE TO DECREASES OF 9% FROM LOWER UNIT SALES AND 4% FROM LOWER AVERAGE NET EFFECTIVE PRICING, BOTH OF WHICH REFLECTED THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

FROZEN

IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NET EFFECTIVE PRICING IS THE WHOLESALE SELLING PRICE ADJUSTED FOR DISCOUNTS, SALES INCENTIVES AND RETURNS.

THE 18% INCREASE IN TV/SVOD DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DUE TO INCREASES OF 9% FROM HIGHER REVENUE SHARE WITH THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF MERCHANDISE BASED ON

FROZEN

AND 7% FROM TV/SVOD DISTRIBUTION. TV/SVOD DISTRIBUTION REVENUE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO WORLDWIDE PAY TELEVISION, WHICH INCLUDED THE BENEFIT OF MORE TITLES AVAILABLE DOMESTICALLY AND SALES OF STAR WARS TITLES INTERNATIONALLY, AND INTERNATIONAL SVOD SALES.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE A DECREASE OF $12 MILLION IN FILM COST AMORTIZATION, FROM $1,802 MILLION TO $1,790 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED FILM COST IMPAIRMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF HIGHER REVENUES AND A HIGHER AVERAGE FILM COST AMORTIZATION RATE FOR THEATRICAL RELEASES IN THE CURRENT YEAR DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF

FROZEN

IN THE PRIOR YEAR. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE COST OF GOODS SOLD AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS, WHICH DECREASED $75 MILLION, FROM $1,335 MILLION TO $1,260 MILLION DUE TO LOWER HOME ENTERTAINMENT PER UNIT COSTS AND UNIT SALES.

SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS DECREASED $252 MILLION FROM

$2,456 MILLION

TO

$2,204 MILLION

DUE TO LOWER THEATRICAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING EXPENSE. LOWER THEATRICAL MARKETING EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FOUR DREAMWORKS TITLES IN RELEASE IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARED TO NONE IN THE CURRENT YEAR AND THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION. THE DECREASE IN HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING EXPENSE WAS DRIVEN BY SPENDING ON

MONSTERS UNIVERSITY

IN THE PRIOR YEAR COMPARED TO NO PIXAR TITLE IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED $424 MILLION TO

$2.0 BILLION

DUE TO HIGHER REVENUE SHARE WITH THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT, INCREASES IN TV/SVOD AND THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION AND LOWER FILM COST IMPAIRMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN HOME ENTERTAINMENT.

AT BROADCASTING, PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS INCREASED $148 MILLION DUE TO A CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASE FOR

MODERN FAMILY

AND

HIGHER PROGRAM WRITE-OFFS.

SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS DECREASED $125 MILLION FROM $2,768 MILLION TO $2,643 DRIVEN BY LOWER MARKETING AND LABOR COSTS.

REVENUES

GAMES REVENUES GREW $244 MILLION FROM

$812 MILLION

TO

$1,056 MILLION

DUE TO INCREASES OF 24% FROM SALES OF CONSOLE GAMES AND 10% FROM MOBILE GAMES. THE INCREASE IN SALES OF CONSOLE GAMES WAS DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE DISNEY INFINITY FRANCHISE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE PERFORMANCE OF

EPIC MICKEY 2

IN FISCAL 2013. FISCAL 2014 BENEFITED FROM THE LAUNCH OF

DISNEY INFINITY 2.0

ON SEPTEMBER 23, 2014 AND HIGHER SALES OF

DISNEY INFINITY 1.0

, WHICH WAS LAUNCHED ON AUGUST 18, 2013. THE INCREASE IN MOBILE GAMES REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY PERFORMANCE OF

TSUM TSUM

AND

FROZEN FREE FALL

, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE AS A RESULT OF DISCONTINUED GAMES.

REVENUE FROM OTHER CONTENT DECREASED $9 MILLION FROM $252 MILLION TO $243 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPIRATION OF A DISTRIBUTION CONTRACT IN FISCAL 2014 AND LOWER ONLINE ADVERTISING REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN REVENUE AT OUR MOBILE PHONE BUSINESS IN JAPAN. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE AT OUR MOBILE PHONE BUSINESS IN JAPAN WAS DUE TO HIGHER HANDSET SALES.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE AN $86 MILLION INCREASE IN COST OF SALES FROM $332 MILLION TO $418 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $44 MILLION DECREASE IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT FROM $326 MILLION TO $282 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN COST OF SALES WAS DUE TO HIGHER DISNEY INFINITY SALES VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FEWER UNITS SOLD OF OTHER TITLES. LOWER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS REFLECTED FEWER TITLES IN DEVELOPMENT AND THE BENEFIT OF RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES.

THE DECREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2015 INCREASED $32 MILLION FROM FISCAL 2014 DUE TO HIGHER LABOR COSTS.

CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2014 INCREASED $80 MILLION FROM FISCAL 2013 DUE TO HIGHER INCENTIVE COMPENSATION COSTS AND CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN COSTS AFFECT RESULTS IN ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS, WITH APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THESE COSTS BEING BORNE BY THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSES OF $457 MILLION, $309 MILLION AND $698 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS

2015

,

2014

AND

2013

, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL

2015

WAS DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED FROM A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF THE PLANS’ LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

IN FISCAL

2016

, WE EXPECT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS TO DECREASE BY $137 MILLION TO APPROXIMATELY $320 MILLION. THE DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A CHANGE IN OUR APPROACH TO MEASURING SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS. FOR FISCAL 2015, WE MEASURED SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS UTILIZING A SINGLE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE DERIVED FROM THE YIELD CURVE USED TO MEASURE THE PLAN OBLIGATIONS. FOR FISCAL 2016, WE ELECTED TO MEASURE SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS BY APPLYING THE SPECIFIC SPOT RATES ALONG THAT YIELD CURVE TO THE PLANS’ LIABILITY CASH FLOWS. WE BELIEVE THE NEW APPROACH PROVIDES A MORE PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS BY ALIGNING THE TIMING OF THE PLANS’ LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE CORRESPONDING SPOT RATES ON THE YIELD CURVE. THIS CHANGE DOES NOT AFFECT THE MEASUREMENT OF OUR PLAN OBLIGATIONS NOR THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR PLANS.

IN FISCAL 2015, THE UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF OUR PLANS INCREASED FROM $3.5 BILLION TO $4.0 BILLION AND THE UNRECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE INCREASED TO $3.9 BILLION

($2.5 BILLION AFTER TAX) FROM $3.5 BILLION ($2.2 BILLION AFTER TAX) AS THE ACTUAL RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS BELOW OUR ASSUMED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN. IF OUR FUTURE INVESTMENT RETURNS DO NOT EXCEED OUR LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURNS AND/OR DISCOUNT RATES DO NOT INCREASE, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE UNRECOGNIZED EXPENSE WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS A NET ACTUARIAL LOSS IN OUR INCOME STATEMENT OVER APPROXIMATELY THE NEXT 9 YEARS. SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF THE IMPACTS OF OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DURING FISCAL

2015

, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED

$385 MILLION

TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS IN FISCAL

2016

TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION TO $950 MILLION. FINAL MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR FISCAL

2016

WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON OUR JANUARY 1,

SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPEMENTS

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

THE COMPANY HAS A FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT IS INTENDED TO REDUCE EARNINGS FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES. AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS DESIGNED TO HEDGE PROJECTED FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED OPERATING INCOME EXPOSURES FOR PERIODS THAT GENERALLY DO NOT EXCEED FOUR YEARS AND TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THESE ASSETS FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. THE ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN A COUNTRY COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COUNTRY OR OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE REVENUE FROM THE COUNTRY. BASED ON OUR HEDGE PORTFOLIO AND OUR PROJECTIONS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE, WE PROJECT AN ADVERSE IMPACT TO GROWTH IN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS FROM FISCAL 2015 TO FISCAL 2016 OF APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST MAJOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES IN WHICH WE TRANSACT.

SEGMENT INFORMATION

ON JUNE 29, 2015, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE COMBINATION OF ITS CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND INTERACTIVE SEGMENTS INTO ONE SEGMENT, DISNEY CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND INTERACTIVE MEDIA. THE COMPANY WILL BEGIN REPORTING THE COMBINED SEGMENT AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2016.

SEVEN TV INVESTMENT

THE COMPANY HAS A 49% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN SEVEN TV, WHICH OPERATES AN ADVERTISING-SUPPORTED, FREE-TO-AIR DISNEY CHANNEL IN RUSSIA. IN OCTOBER 2014, REGULATIONS WERE ADOPTED IN RUSSIA THAT PROHIBIT MORE THAN 20% FOREIGN OWNERSHIP OF MEDIA COMPANIES. THE REGULATIONS BECOME EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2016. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF RESTRUCTURING ITS INVESTMENT IN A WAY THAT WE BELIEVE WILL COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS. WE UNDERSTAND THAT THE RUSSIAN GOVERNMENT WILL REVIEW THE NEW STRUCTURE FOR COMPLIANCE DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2016 AND, DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME, WE COULD HAVE AN IMPAIRMENT OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION INVESTMENT RELATED TO THE DISNEY CHANNEL IN RUSSIA. THE COMPANY’S SHARE OF THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF SEVEN TV IS REPORTED AS “EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES” IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

COMPARED TO FISCAL 2014 D

RIVEN BY

HIGHER OPERATING CASH FLOW AT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS AND STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INCOME TAXES PAID. HIGHER OPERATING CASH FLOW AT MEDIA NETWORKS WAS DUE TO INCREASED OPERATING RECEIPTS DRIVEN BY AFFILIATE FEE GROWTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DISBURSEMENTS FOR OPERATING EXPENSES AND SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS. THE INCREASE IN PAYMENTS FOR SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO COLLEGE FOOTBALL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF A CHANGE IN PAYMENT TERMS FOR CERTAIN SPORTS RIGHTS IN FISCAL 2014. STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT CASH FLOW BENEFITED FROM LOWER OPERATING CASH DISBURSEMENTS DRIVEN BY LOWER THEATRICAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING EXPENSE.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2014 INCREASED 3% OR $0.3 BILLION TO $9.8 BILLION COMPARED TO FISCAL 2013.  THE INCREASE REFLECTED HIGHER OPERATING CASH RECEIPTS FROM INCREASED REVENUES ACROSS ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS, HIGHER CASH PAYMENTS DUE TO NEW CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT TERMS FOR SPORTS RIGHTS, HIGHER PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION SPENDING AT MEDIA NETWORKS AND STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT AND HIGHER PAYMENTS AT PARKS AND RESORTS. THE INCREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT PARKS AND RESORTS WAS DUE TO LABOR COST INFLATION AND INCREASED SPENDING ON NEW GUEST OFFERINGS. OPERATING CASH FLOWS ALSO BENEFITED FROM THE ABSENCE OF THE CELADOR LITIGATION PAYMENT MADE IN FISCAL 2013 AND LOWER PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT ARE PRINCIPALLY FOR THEME PARK AND RESORT EXPANSION, NEW ATTRACTIONS, CRUISE SHIPS, CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS AND SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURE. THE INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT OUR INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS IN BOTH FISCAL 2015 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2014 AND FISCAL 2014 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2013 WAS DUE TO HIGHER CONSTRUCTION SPENDING FOR THE SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT. THE INCREASE AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS IN FISCAL 2015 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2014 WAS DRIVEN BY SPENDING ON NEW ATTRACTIONS AT WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT MEDIA NETWORKS PRIMARILY REFLECT INVESTMENTS IN FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT FOR EXPANDING AND UPGRADING BROADCAST CENTERS, PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND TELEVISION STATION FACILITIES.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT CORPORATE PRIMARILY REFLECT INVESTMENTS IN CORPORATE FACILITIES, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE AND EQUIPMENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE DECREASE IN NET CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $1.2 BILLION VERSUS THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR WAS DUE TO HIGHER NET BORROWINGS AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM NONCONTROLLING INTEREST HOLDERS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED DIVIDENDS.

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES WAS $6.7 BILLION IN FISCAL 2014 COMPARED TO $4.2 BILLION IN FISCAL 2013.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH BALANCES, OTHER LIQUID ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY’S OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAN BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL. SEE “ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS”. IN ADDITION TO MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE COMPANY’S BORROWING COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANY’S PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CERTAIN CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. AS OF

OCTOBER 3, 2015

, MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE’S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A2 AND P-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK; STANDARD & POOR’S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A AND A-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK; AND FITCH’S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A AND F-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK. THE COMPANY’S BANK FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT, RELATING TO INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE COMPANY MET ON

, THE COMPANY HAS A $96 MILLION LIABILITY FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF MAKER STUDIOS, INC. SEE NOTES 3, 6 AND 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY’S CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL GUARANTEES.

LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS

AS DISCLOSED IN NOTES 9 AND 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR CERTAIN TAX AND LEGAL MATTERS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT. FOR A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND COSTS

WE EXPENSE FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION, PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIOD’S REVENUES TO THE ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FOR EACH PRODUCTION. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES DECREASES, AMORTIZATION OF FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED. CONVERSELY, IF OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES INCREASES, FILM AND TELEVISION COST AMORTIZATION MAY BE SLOWED. FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION SERIES, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER.

WITH RESPECT TO FILMS INTENDED FOR THEATRICAL RELEASE, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES (AND THEREFORE AFFECTING FUTURE FILM COST AMORTIZATION AND/OR IMPAIRMENT) IS THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. REVENUES DERIVED FROM OTHER MARKETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE THEATRICAL RELEASE (E.G., THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT OR TELEVISION MARKETS) HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE VARIES PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND DEMAND FOR A PARTICULAR FILM, THE POPULARITY OF COMPETING FILMS AT THE TIME OF RELEASE AND THE LEVEL OF MARKETING EFFORT. UPON A FILM’S RELEASE AND DETERMINATION OF THE THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANY’S ESTIMATES OF REVENUES FROM SUCCEEDING WINDOWS AND MARKETS ARE REVISED BASED ON HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND AN ANALYSIS OF CURRENT MARKET TRENDS. THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR RELEASED FILMS IS THE LEVEL OF EXPECTED HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES. HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES VARY BASED ON THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF COMPETING HOME ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE MANNER IN WHICH RETAILERS MARKET AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO TELEVISION SERIES OR OTHER TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS INTENDED FOR BROADCAST, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES IS THE PROGRAM’S RATING AND THE STRENGTH OF THE ADVERTISING MARKET. PROGRAM RATINGS, WHICH ARE AN INDICATION OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, DIRECTLY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO GENERATE ADVERTISING REVENUES DURING THE AIRING OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, TELEVISION SERIES WITH GREATER MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUES THROUGH THE EVENTUAL SALE OF THE PROGRAM RIGHTS IN THE SYNDICATION, INTERNATIONAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKETS. ALTERNATIVELY, POOR RATINGS MAY RESULT IN A TELEVISION SERIES CANCELLATION, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE AN IMMEDIATE WRITE-DOWN OF ANY UNAMORTIZED PRODUCTION COSTS. A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE ADVERTISING MARKET WOULD ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ESTIMATES.

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED SERIES, MOVIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. AMORTIZATION OF THOSE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ASSETS BEING AMORTIZED ON A NUMBER OF AIRINGS BASIS MAY BE ACCELERATED IF WE REDUCE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS AND SLOWED IF WE INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS. THE NUMBER OF FUTURE AIRINGS OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY THE PROGRAM’S RATINGS IN PREVIOUS AIRINGS, EXPECTED ADVERTISING RATES AND AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMMING. ACCORDINGLY, PLANNED USAGE IS REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND REVISED IF NECESSARY. WE AMORTIZE RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASONS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE OF EACH YEAR IN THE ARRANGEMENT. THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF EACH YEAR IS BASED ON OUR PROJECTIONS OF REVENUES OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD, WHICH INCLUDE ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE REVENUE. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON APPROXIMATE EACH SEASON’S ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. IF PLANNED USAGE PATTERNS OR ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUES BY YEAR WERE TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY, AMORTIZATION OF OUR SPORTS RIGHTS COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED OR SLOWED.

COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS, WHICH COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WITH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANY’S DAYPARTS ARE: PRIMETIME, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, NEWS AND SPORTS (INCLUDES BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE NETWORK. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM. ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR PROJECTIONS, FILM, TELEVISION AND PROGRAMMING COST WRITE-DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ITS VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH BUSINESS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THESE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES.

WE REDUCE HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND GAME REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED FUTURE RETURNS OF MERCHANDISE AND FOR CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND SALES INCENTIVES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL RETURN EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD, WE MAY RECORD LESS REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS OR CONCESSIONS EXCEED THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT. CONVERSELY, IF WE OVERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS FOR A PERIOD, WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS ARE LESS THAN ESTIMATED.

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM EXPIRING MULTI-USE TICKETS RATABLY OVER THE ESTIMATED USAGE PERIOD. FOR NON-EXPIRING, MULTI-DAY TICKETS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER A FIVE-YEAR TIME PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE. THE ESTIMATED USAGE PERIODS ARE DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IF ACTUAL USAGE IS DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATED USAGE, REVENUES MAY NOT BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIODS THE RELATED SERVICES ARE RENDERED. IN ADDITION, A CHANGE IN USAGE PATTERNS WOULD IMPACT THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

THE COMPANY’S PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE CALCULATED USING A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY MEASUREMENT, WHICH WE EVALUATE ANNUALLY. OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE AND EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS RETIREMENT PATTERNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER AND RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS FOR BENEFITS AS A PRESENT VALUE ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE INCREASES THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES PENSION EXPENSE. THE GUIDELINE FOR SETTING THIS RATE IS A HIGH-QUALITY LONG-TERM CORPORATE BOND RATE. WE INCREASED OUR DISCOUNT RATE TO

4.47%

AT THE END OF FISCAL

2015

FROM

4.40%

AT THE END OF FISCAL

2014

TO REFLECT MARKET INTEREST RATE CONDITIONS AT OUR FISCAL 2015 YEAR END MEASUREMENT DATE. THE COMPANY’S DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS AND REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLANS’ LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE TOTAL BENEFIT EXPENSE FOR FISCAL

2016

BY APPROXIMATELY

$230 MILLION

AND WOULD INCREASE THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT

OCTOBER 3, 2015

BY APPROXIMATELY

$2.5 BILLION

. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE TOTAL BENEFIT EXPENSE AND THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY

$223 MILLION

AND

$2.1 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATION AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON EACH PLAN ASSET CLASS. OUR EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS 7.50%. A LOWER EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN THE LONG-TERM ASSET RETURN ASSUMPTION WOULD IMPACT FISCAL

2016

ANNUAL BENEFIT EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY

$105 MILLION.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2015, WE CHANGED THE APPROACH WE WILL USE IN FISCAL 2016 TO DETERMINE THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSE. SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO TEST GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IF CURRENT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE, ON AN INTERIM BASIS. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. WE APPLY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES ARE SENSITIVE TO OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARGINS FOR THESE BUSINESSES. WE INCLUDE IN THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUE WE BELIEVE THE REPORTING UNIT WOULD RECEIVE IF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE REPORTING UNIT THAT IS BEING USED BY OTHER REPORTING UNITS WAS LICENSED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AT ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS THOSE INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS. WE BELIEVE OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE CONSISTENT WITH HOW A MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANT WOULD VALUE OUR REPORTING UNITS.

IN TIMES OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A GREATER DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY TESTS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (TRIGGERING EVENTS) INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ONCE A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST EMPLOYED IS BASED ON WHETHER THE INTENT IS TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR CONTINUED USE OR TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR SALE. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR ASSETS HELD FOR USE REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET GROUP TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP. AN ASSET GROUP IS ESTABLISHED BY IDENTIFYING THE LOWEST

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEVEL OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY A GROUP OF ASSETS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER ASSETS AND COULD INCLUDE ASSETS USED ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES OR SEGMENTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GROUP’S LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GROUP’S LONG-LIVED ASSETS. THE IMPAIRMENT IS ALLOCATED TO THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OF THE GROUP ON A PRO RATA BASIS USING THE RELATIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH ASSET IS ABOVE ITS FAIR VALUE. FOR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE ASSET’S FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE. DETERMINING WHETHER A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS IMPAIRED REQUIRES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING WHETHER A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ASSET GROUPS, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUES. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT ASSET GROUPS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY HAS COST AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES AS WELL AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THESE INVESTMENTS, WE CONSIDER THESE FACTORS AS WELL AS THE FORECASTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEES AND MARKET VALUES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF THESE FORECASTS ARE NOT MET OR MARKET VALUES INDICATE AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.

THE COMPANY TESTED ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT AND RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $10 MILLION, $46 MILLION AND $5 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THE FISCAL 2014 IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO RADIO FCC LICENSES HELD BY BUSINESSES IN THE MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RADIO FCC LICENSES WERE DERIVED FROM MARKET TRANSACTIONS. THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE RECORDED IN “RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES” IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

WE EVALUATE OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND ESTIMATE COLLECTABILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL BAD DEBT EXPERIENCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. IN TIMES OF DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC TURMOIL, OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER UNCERTAINTY THAN IN MORE STABLE PERIODS. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS IS TOO LOW, COSTS AND EXPENSES MAY INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND IF IT IS TOO HIGH, COSTS AND EXPENSES MAY DECREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LOSSES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS. THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND ARE BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE PROCEEDINGS. SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.

INCOME TAX AUDITS

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. OUR DETERMINATIONS REGARDING THE RECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX BENEFITS ARE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE TAX AND LEGAL COUNSEL, WHERE APPROPRIATE, AND ARE BASED UPON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF OUR TAX POSITIONS IN CONSIDERATION OF APPLICABLE TAX STATUTES AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND PRECEDENTS AND UPON THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF PROCEEDINGS (OR NEGOTIATIONS) WITH TAXING AND LEGAL AUTHORITIES. THE TAX BENEFITS ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY THE COMPANY MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE RECOGNIZED IN OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S DECISION TO SETTLE RATHER THAN LITIGATE A MATTER, RELEVANT LEGAL PRECEDENT RELATED TO SIMILAR MATTERS AND THE COMPANY’S SUCCESS IN SUPPORTING ITS FILING POSITIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

SEE NOTE 18 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE WRITTEN OR ORAL STATEMENTS THAT ARE “FORWARD-LOOKING,” INCLUDING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SEC AND IN REPORTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. SUCH STATEMENTS MAY, FOR EXAMPLE, EXPRESS EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE ACTIONS THAT WE MAY TAKE, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING OR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, OR ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL INCLUDING CHANGES IN DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THESE

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STATEMENTS ARE MADE ON THE BASIS OF MANAGEMENT’S VIEWS AND ASSUMPTIONS AS OF THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE THESE STATEMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WILL NECESSARILY COME TO PASS. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING THESE EXPECTATIONS ARE SET FORTH UNDER ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THE COMPANY’S EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO THE COMPANY’S PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW IN ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED, TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE PRINCIPAL FOREIGN CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES GENERALLY FOR PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED FOUR YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES. THE ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN A COUNTRY COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COUNTRY OR OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE REVENUE FROM THE COUNTRY.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS ARE TO USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES. THE AMOUNTS HEDGED USING COMMODITY SWAP CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON FORECASTED LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES, SUCH AS FUEL OIL AND GASOLINE.

IT IS THE COMPANY’S POLICY TO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY OTHER HEDGING TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

VALUE AT RISK (VAR)

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VAR MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES WERE MADE ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED IN A VAR COMPUTATION. THE COMPANY’S COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND EQUITY PRICES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS WERE DETERMINED BY OBSERVING INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY AND EQUITY MARKET CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING QUARTER FOR THE CALCULATION OF VAR AMOUNTS AT EACH FISCAL QUARTER END. THE MODEL INCLUDES ALL OF THE COMPANY’S DEBT AS WELL AS ALL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH CERTAIN OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WILL BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN 2013. BASED ON OUR EVALUATION UNDER THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK,

MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF

OCTOBER 3, 2015.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

OCTOBER 3, 2015

HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT, WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN.

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT

OCTOBER 3, 2015

AND

SEPTEMBER 27, 2014

, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED

OCTOBER 3, 2015

IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

OCTOBER 3, 2015

, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN 2013 (COSO). THE COMPANY’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS MAJORITY-OWNED AND CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO RELATIONSHIPS OR INVESTMENTS WITH OTHER ENTITIES THAT MAY BE A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE). A VIE IS CONSOLIDATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF THE COMPANY HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE VIE AND HAS THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE (AS DEFINED BY ASC 810-10-25-38). DISNEYLAND PARIS, HKDL AND SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT (COLLECTIVELY THE INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS) ARE VIES. COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES (THE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES) HAVE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THE INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS, WHICH PROVIDE THE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN PROTECTIVE RIGHTS OF JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS, WITH THE ABILITY TO DIRECT THE DAY-TO-DAY OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF BUSINESS STRATEGIES THAT WE BELIEVE MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS. IN ADDITION, THE MANAGEMENT COMPANIES RECEIVE MANAGEMENT FEES UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS THAT WE BELIEVE COULD BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY HAS CONSOLIDATED THE INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVENTORY PRIMARILY INCLUDES VACATION TIMESHARE UNITS, MERCHANDISE, MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES. CARRYING AMOUNTS OF VACATION OWNERSHIP UNITS ARE RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. CARRYING AMOUNTS OF MERCHANDISE, MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A MOVING AVERAGE COST BASIS AND ARE RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS INCLUDE CAPITALIZABLE PRODUCTION COSTS, PRODUCTION OVERHEAD, INTEREST, DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND ACQUIRED PRODUCTION COSTS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR FAIR VALUE. ACQUIRED PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR THE COMPANY’S CABLE AND BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ACQUIRED TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE RECORDED WHEN THE LICENSE PERIOD BEGINS AND THE PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE FOR USE. MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION, PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS ARE EXPENSED OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIOD’S REVENUES TO ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FOR EACH PRODUCTION. FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN

TEN

YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION SERIES, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN

TEN

YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION,

FIVE

YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER. FOR ACQUIRED FILM LIBRARIES, REMAINING REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO BE EARNED FOR UP TO

TWENTY

YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS, WHICH COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WITH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE COMPANY BASES THESE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS ON THE COMPANY’S ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT HOW MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD PRICE THE ASSET AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE, WHICH MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN THE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY REALIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS EXCEED THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES IS WRITTEN OFF. FILM DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED OR HAVE NOT BEEN SET FOR PRODUCTION WITHIN

THREE

YEARS ARE GENERALLY WRITTEN OFF.

THE COSTS OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED SERIES, MOVIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS ARE EXPENSED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASONS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE OF EACH YEAR IN THE ARRANGEMENT. THE ESTIMATED VALUE OF EACH YEAR IS BASED ON OUR PROJECTIONS OF REVENUES OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD, WHICH INCLUDE ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE REVENUE. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON APPROXIMATE EACH SEASON’S ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM.

THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF NETWORK TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANY’S DAYPARTS ARE: PRIMETIME, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, NEWS AND SPORTS (INCLUDES BROADCAST AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE NETWORK.

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE COSTS

THE COMPANY EXPENSES COSTS INCURRED IN THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE OF DEVELOPING OR ACQUIRING INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE, SUCH AS RESEARCH AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES AS WELL AS COSTS INCURRED IN THE POST-IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONAL STAGE, SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING. CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OCCURS ONLY AFTER THE PRELIMINARY-PROJECT STAGE IS COMPLETE, MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZES THE PROJECT AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETED AND THE SOFTWARE WILL BE USED FOR THE FUNCTION INTENDED.

GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO TEST GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IF CURRENT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE, ON AN INTERIM BASIS. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. WE APPLY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. WE INCLUDE IN THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUE WE BELIEVE THE REPORTING UNIT WOULD RECEIVE IF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE REPORTING UNIT THAT IS BEING USED BY OTHER REPORTING UNITS WAS LICENSED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AT ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS THOSE INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS.

IN TIMES OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A GREATER DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO LEGAL, COMPETITIVE, ECONOMIC OR OTHER FACTORS THAT MATERIALLY LIMIT THE USEFUL LIFE OF OUR FCC LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS.

AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER PERIODS UP TO

40 YEARS

. THE COSTS TO PERIODICALLY RENEW OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

THE COMPANY TESTS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (TRIGGERING EVENTS) INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ONCE A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST EMPLOYED IS BASED ON WHETHER THE INTENT IS TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR CONTINUED USE OR TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR SALE. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR ASSETS HELD FOR USE REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET GROUP AGAINST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP. AN ASSET GROUP IS ESTABLISHED BY IDENTIFYING THE LOWEST LEVEL OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY A GROUP OF ASSETS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER ASSETS AND COULD INCLUDE ASSETS USED ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES OR SEGMENTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF AN ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GROUP’S LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GROUP’S LONG-LIVED ASSETS. THE IMPAIRMENT IS ALLOCATED TO THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OF THE GROUP ON A PRO RATA BASIS USING THE RELATIVE CARRYING AMOUNT, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH ASSET IS ABOVE ITS FAIR VALUE. FOR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE ASSET’S FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE.

THE COMPANY TESTED ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT AND RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF

$10 MILLION

,

$46 MILLION

AND

$5 MILLION

IN FISCAL YEARS 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THE FISCAL 2014 IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO RADIO FCC LICENSES HELD BY BUSINESSES IN THE MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RADIO FCC LICENSES WERE DERIVED FROM MARKET TRANSACTIONS. THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES WERE RECORDED IN “RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES” IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (DERIVATIVES) INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEDGES AND HEDGED ITEMS AS WELL AS ITS RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR UNDERTAKING VARIOUS HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY PRIMARILY ENTERS INTO

TWO

TYPES OF DERIVATIVES: HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AND HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE. HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED ASSET, LIABILITY, OR A FIRM COMMITMENT. HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION (E.G. FORECASTED REVENUE) OR THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED, RELATED TO A RECOGNIZED LIABILITY OR ASSET (E.G. FLOATING RATE DEBT).

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES AND ASSIGNS THE DERIVATIVES AS HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFIC ASSETS OR SPECIFIC LIABILITIES. WHEN HEDGED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE SOLD OR EXTINGUISHED OR THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED OCCUR OR ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED DERIVATIVES.

THE COMPANY’S HEDGE POSITIONS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON THE BALANCE SHEET. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES THE DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS AS INTEREST RATES CHANGE AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIVES OF THE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE TERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE SWAP AGREEMENTS, PRIOR TO THEIR ORIGINAL MATURITY, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THESE DERIVATIVES ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET CERTAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURES OF THE COMPANY AND ARE CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE WITH CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (SEE NOTES 8 AND 16).

INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED WITH RESPECT TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IN THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF ITEMS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. WHERE, BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME AMOUNT OF RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE AMOUNT THAT, IN MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT, IS SUFFICIENT TO REDUCE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

A TAX POSITION MUST MEET A MINIMUM PROBABILITY THRESHOLD BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN

FIFTY PERCENT

LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

THE COMPANY PRESENTS BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AMOUNTS. BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DISNEY BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EPS IS BASED UPON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR, WHICH IS CALCULATED USING THE TREASURY-STOCK METHOD FOR EQUITY-BASED AWARDS (AWARDS). COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION IN PERIODS FOR WHICH THEY HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT. STOCK OPTIONS FOR WHICH THE EXERCISE PRICE EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OVER THE PERIOD ARE ANTI-DILUTIVE AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION.

OF CASH CONSIDERATION. MAKER SHAREHOLDERS MAY ALSO RECEIVE UP TO

$450 MILLION

OF ADDITIONAL CASH UPON FINAL DETERMINATION OF MAKER’S ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE TARGETS FOR CALENDAR YEARS 2014 AND 2015. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A

GOODWILL REFLECTS THE SYNERGIES EXPECTED FROM ENHANCING THE PRESENCE OF DISNEY’S FRANCHISES AND BRANDS THROUGH THE USE OF MAKER’S DISTRIBUTION PLATFORM, ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE CAPABILITY. THE REVENUE AND NET INCOME OF MAKER INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME FOR FISCAL YEARS 2015 AND 2014 WERE NOT MATERIAL.

VENEZUELA FOREIGN CURRENCY LOSS

THE COMPANY HAS OPERATIONS IN VENEZUELA, INCLUDING FILM AND TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION AND MERCHANDISE LICENSING AND HAS NET MONETARY ASSETS DENOMINATED IN VENEZUELAN BOLIVARES (BSF), WHICH PRIMARILY CONSIST OF CASH. THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT (GOVERNMENT) HAS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS, WHICH CENTRALIZE THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF ALL FOREIGN CURRENCY AT AN OFFICIAL RATE DETERMINED BY THE GOVERNMENT, CURRENTLY

6.3

BSF PER U.S. DOLLAR. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN UNABLE TO REPATRIATE ITS CASH AT THE OFFICIAL RATE, WE TRANSLATED OUR NET MONETARY ASSETS AT THE OFFICIAL RATE THROUGH DECEMBER 28, 2013. IN JANUARY 2014, THE GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT CURRENCY ARISING FROM CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS COULD BE EXCHANGED AT AN ALTERNATIVE RATE (SICAD 1), WHICH FLUCTUATES BASED ON GOVERNMENT-RUN AUCTIONS. THE ABILITY TO CONVERT CURRENCY IN THE SICAD 1 MARKET WAS DEPENDENT ON MARKET FACTORS AND GOVERNMENT DISCRETION. IN MARCH 2014, THE GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED A NEW CURRENCY EXCHANGE MARKET (SICAD 2), WHICH ALLOWED ENTITIES TO SUBMIT A DAILY APPLICATION TO EXCHANGE FOREIGN CURRENCY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE REGISTERED WITH THE VENEZUELAN CENTRAL BANK. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES UNDER SICAD 2 FLUCTUATED DAILY. THE ABILITY TO CONVERT IN THE SICAD 2 MARKET WAS ALSO DEPENDENT ON MARKET FACTORS INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF U.S. DOLLARS. ALTHOUGH A SMALL PORTION OF THE COMPANY’S CASH MAY HAVE BEEN ELIGIBLE TO BE EXCHANGED AT SICAD 1, THE MAJORITY WAS ONLY ELIGIBLE FOR EXCHANGE AT SICAD 2. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY BEGAN TRANSLATING ITS BSF DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS AT THE SICAD 2 RATE RESULTING IN A LOSS OF

$143 MILLION

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2014 BASED ON THE SICAD 2 RATE, WHICH WAS

50.9

BSF PER U.S. DOLLAR AT MARCH 29, 2014.

79

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE GOVERNMENT COMBINED THE SICAD 1 AND SICAD 2 EXCHANGE MECHANISMS (SICAD) AND INTRODUCED ANOTHER EXCHANGE MECHANISM, SIMADI. THE SIMADI EXCHANGE MECHANISM ALLOWS FOR TRADING BSF AT PRICES SET BY THE MARKET. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT CAN SUCCESSFULLY CONVERT CURRENCY AT THE SICAD RATE AND THEREFORE, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2015, THE COMPANY BEGAN TRANSLATING ITS BSF DENOMINATED NET MONETARY ASSETS AT THE SIMADI RATE RESULTING IN AN IMMATERIAL LOSS INCLUDED IN "COSTS AND EXPENSES" IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2015, THE SIMADI RATE WAS

199.4

BSF PER U.S. DOLLAR, AND THE COMPANY HAD NET MONETARY ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY

INDEFINITE CARRYFORWARD PERIOD IN FRANCE AND HONG KONG AND A FIVE-YEAR CARRYFORWARD PERIOD IN CHINA.

THE COMPANY HAD A

$399 MILLION

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSET ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMPANY’S TAX BASIS IN ITS INVESTMENT IN DISNEYLAND PARIS AND THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENT CARRYING VALUE OF DISNEYLAND PARIS. AS A RESULT OF THE DISNEYLAND PARIS RECAPITALIZATION AND THE INCREASE IN THE COMPANY’S OWNERSHIP INTEREST (SEE NOTE 6 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS TRANSACTION), THE COMPANY CAN NO LONGER RECOGNIZE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET ON THE BASIS DIFFERENCE. ACCORDINGLY, THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET WAS WRITTEN OFF TO INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN FISCAL 2015.

AS OF

OCTOBER 3, 2015

, THE COMPANY HAD UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OF APPROXIMATELY

$2.7 BILLION

FOR WHICH DEFERRED U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REINVEST THESE EARNINGS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IF THESE AMOUNTS WERE DISTRIBUTED TO THE U.S., IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHERWISE, THE COMPANY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL U.S. INCOME TAXES. ASSUMING THESE FOREIGN EARNINGS WERE REPATRIATED UNDER LAWS AND RATES APPLICABLE AT

2015

FISCAL YEAR END, THE INCREMENTAL FEDERAL TAX APPLICABLE TO THE EARNINGS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY

$547 MILLION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PLAN ASSETS

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY’S DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE MANAGED IN A THIRD-PARTY MASTER TRUST. THE INVESTMENT POLICY AND ALLOCATION OF THE ASSETS IN THE MASTER TRUST WERE APPROVED BY THE COMPANY’S INVESTMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE, WHICH HAS OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMPANY’S RETIREMENT PLANS. THE INVESTMENT POLICY RANGES FOR THE MAJOR ASSET CLASSES ARE AS FOLLOWS.

THE PRIMARY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE FOR THE ASSETS WITHIN THE MASTER TRUST IS THE PRUDENT AND COST EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF ASSETS TO SATISFY BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. FINANCIAL RISKS ARE MANAGED THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION OF PLAN ASSETS, SELECTION OF INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND THROUGH THE INVESTMENT GUIDELINES INCORPORATED IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. ASSETS ARE MONITORED TO ENSURE THAT INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE COMMENSURATE WITH RISKS TAKEN.

THE LONG-TERM ASSET ALLOCATION POLICY FOR THE MASTER TRUST WAS ESTABLISHED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE AVERAGE AGE OF PARTICIPANTS, THE NUMBER OF RETIREES, THE DURATION OF LIABILITIES AND THE EXPECTED PAYOUT RATIO. LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF THE MASTER TRUST ARE GENERALLY MANAGED USING CASH GENERATED BY INVESTMENTS OR BY LIQUIDATING SECURITIES.

ASSETS ARE GENERALLY MANAGED BY EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS, AND WE HAVE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO SECURITIES IN THE MASTER TRUST. THESE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE ACCOUNT GUIDELINES THAT ESTABLISH PERMITTED SECURITIES AND RISK CONTROLS COMMENSURATE WITH THE ACCOUNT’S INVESTMENT STRATEGY. SOME AGREEMENTS PERMIT THE USE OF DERIVATIVE SECURITIES (FUTURES, OPTIONS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS) THAT ENABLE INVESTMENT MANAGERS TO ENHANCE RETURNS AND MANAGE EXPOSURES WITHIN THEIR ACCOUNTS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF PLAN ASSETS

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FOR SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND IS CLASSIFIED IN ONE OF THE FOLLOWING THREE CATEGORIES.

LEVEL 1 – QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS

LEVEL 2 – QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE; AND MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS IN WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS AND SIGNIFICANT VALUE DRIVERS ARE OBSERVABLE IN ACTIVE MARKETS

LEVEL 3 – VALUATIONS DERIVED FROM VALUATION TECHNIQUES IN WHICH ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS OR SIGNIFICANT VALUE DRIVERS ARE UNOBSERVABLE

FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED FOR ASSETS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE METHODOLOGIES USED AT

OCTOBER 3, 2015

AND

SEPTEMBER 27, 2014.

LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE YEAR. INVESTMENTS IN COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS ARE VALUED BASED ON THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE-LISTED PRICE OR A BROKER’S QUOTE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET. INVESTMENTS IN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES ARE VALUED BASED ON A BROKER’S QUOTE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET.

LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS IN GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY BONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS), ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND CORPORATE BONDS ARE VALUED USING A BROKER’S QUOTE IN A NON-ACTIVE MARKET OR AN EVALUATED PRICE BASED ON A COMPILATION OF REPORTED MARKET INFORMATION, SUCH AS BENCHMARK YIELD CURVES, CREDIT SPREADS AND ESTIMATED DEFAULT RATES. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE VALUED BASED ON MODELS THAT INCORPORATE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES, SUCH AS INTEREST RATES OR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. SHARES IN MONEY MARKET AND MUTUAL FUNDS AND CERTAIN ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED AT THE NET ASSET VALUE OF THE SHARES HELD BY THE PLAN AT YEAR-END BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS.

LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF INVESTMENTS IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, WHICH ARE VALUED BASED ON THE MASTER TRUST’S PRO-RATA SHARE OF THE PARTNERSHIPS’ UNDERLYING NET INVESTMENT HOLDINGS AS REPORTED IN THE PARTNERSHIPS’ FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, AND THE PARTNERSHIPS’ FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE GENERALLY AUDITED ANNUALLY. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS ARE ESTIMATED USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (E.G., DISCOUNTED

ASSUMPTIONS

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS THE DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE, HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST AS WELL AS THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

DISCOUNT RATE

— THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE FOR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS REFLECTS THE MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANY’S DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS AND REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF THE PLANS’ LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2015, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE APPROACH USED TO MEASURE SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS FOR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. FOR FISCAL 2015, THE COMPANY MEASURED SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS UTILIZING A SINGLE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE DERIVED FROM THE YIELD CURVE USED TO MEASURE THE PLAN OBLIGATIONS. FOR FISCAL 2016, WE ELECTED TO MEASURE SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS BY APPLYING THE SPECIFIC SPOT RATES ALONG THAT YIELD CURVE TO THE PLANS’ LIABILITY CASH FLOWS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE NEW APPROACH PROVIDES A MORE PRECISE MEASUREMENT OF SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS BY ALIGNING THE TIMING OF THE PLANS’ LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE CORRESPONDING SPOT RATES ON THE YIELD CURVE. THIS CHANGE DOES NOT AFFECT THE MEASUREMENT OF OUR PLAN OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS ACCOUNTED FOR THIS CHANGE AS A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE AND, ACCORDINGLY, HAS ACCOUNTED FOR IT ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS.

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

— THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM RETURNS ON AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTING OF A MIXTURE OF EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS. WHEN DETERMINING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON THE ASSET CLASSES (BOTH HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED) IN WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE PENSION FUNDS TO BE INVESTED. THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN BY ASSET CLASS WERE CONSIDERED IN SETTING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION.

THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN A NUMBER OF MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION PLANS UNDER UNION AND INDUSTRY-WIDE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THAT COVER OUR UNION-REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES AND EXPENSES ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PLANS AS INCURRED. THESE PLANS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR RETIREMENT, DEATH AND/OR TERMINATION BENEFITS FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE APPLICABLE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS, BASED ON SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY/PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS, VESTING PERIODS AND BENEFIT FORMULAS. THE RISKS OF PARTICIPATING IN THESE MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS ARE DIFFERENT FROM SINGLE-EMPLOYER PLANS. FOR EXAMPLE.

•

ASSETS CONTRIBUTED TO THE MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN BY ONE EMPLOYER MAY BE USED TO PROVIDE BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES OF OTHER PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS.

•

IF A PARTICIPATING EMPLOYER STOPS CONTRIBUTING TO THE MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN, THE UNFUNDED OBLIGATIONS OF THE PLAN MAY BECOME THE OBLIGATION OF THE REMAINING PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS.

•

IF THE COMPANY CHOOSES TO STOP PARTICIPATING IN THESE MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY THOSE PLANS AN AMOUNT BASED ON THE UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF THE PLAN.

THE COMPANY ALSO PARTICIPATES IN SEVERAL MULTIEMPLOYER HEALTH AND WELFARE PLANS THAT COVER BOTH ACTIVE AND RETIRED EMPLOYEES. HEALTH CARE BENEFITS ARE PROVIDED TO PARTICIPANTS WHO MEET CERTAIN ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE APPLICABLE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT.

EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

UNDER VARIOUS PLANS, THE COMPANY MAY GRANT STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY-BASED AWARDS TO EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL. THE COMPANY’S APPROACH TO LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION CONTEMPLATES AWARDS OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS). CERTAIN RSUS AWARDED TO SENIOR EXECUTIVES VEST BASED UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF MARKET AND/OR PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS (PERFORMANCE RSUS).

STOCK OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY GRANTED AT EXERCISE PRICES EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING THE MARKET PRICE AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND BECOME EXERCISABLE RATABLY OVER A

FOUR

-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE GRANT DATE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR OUR STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

AFTER DECEMBER 2009

AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANY’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OPTIONS CAN OCCASIONALLY EXTEND UP TO

15 YEARS

AFTER DATE OF GRANT. RSUS GENERALLY VEST RATABLY OVER

FOUR

YEARS AND PERFORMANCE RSUS FULLY VEST AFTER

THREE

YEARS, SUBJECT TO ACHIEVING MARKET AND/OR PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS.

EQUITY-BASED AWARD GRANTS GENERALLY PROVIDE CONTINUED VESTING, IN THE EVENT OF TERMINATION, FOR EMPLOYEES THAT REACH AGE 60 OR GREATER, HAVE AT LEAST TEN YEARS OF SERVICE AND HAVE HELD THE AWARD FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR.

EACH SHARE GRANTED SUBJECT TO A STOCK OPTION AWARD REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE UNDER THE COMPANY’S STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS BY ONE SHARE WHILE EACH SHARE GRANTED SUBJECT TO A RSU AWARD REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE BY TWO SHARES. AS OF

OCTOBER 3, 2015

, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE COMPANY’S STOCK INCENTIVE PLANS (ASSUMING ALL THE AWARDS ARE IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS) WAS APPROXIMATELY

87 MILLION

SHARES AND THE NUMBER AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE ASSUMING ALL AWARDS ARE IN THE FORM OF RSUS WAS APPROXIMATELY

44 MILLION

SHARES. THE COMPANY SATISFIES STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF RSUS WITH NEWLY ISSUED SHARES. STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS ARE GENERALLY FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES WHO TERMINATE PRIOR TO VESTING.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EACH YEAR, DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE YEAR, THE COMPANY AWARDS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO A BROAD-BASED GROUP OF MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL. THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS VOLATILITY, DIVIDEND YIELD AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE (THE MULTIPLE OF EXERCISE PRICE TO GRANT PRICE AT WHICH EXERCISES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON AVERAGE) AND THE TERMINATION RATE (THE PROBABILITY OF A VESTED OPTION BEING CANCELLED DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE OPTION HOLDER) IN COMPUTING THE VALUE OF THE OPTION.

IN FISCAL YEARS

2015

,

2014

AND

2013

, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OPTION-VALUATION MODEL WERE AS FOLLOWS.

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS NOT ADJUSTED AFTER THE GRANT DATE, CHANGES IN THE COMPANY’S ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE THE VALUE OF, AND THEREFORE THE EXPENSE RELATED TO, FUTURE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE GREATEST VARIATION IN FAIR VALUE IN THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ARE THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN EITHER THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE WILL CAUSE THE BINOMIAL OPTION VALUE TO INCREASE OR DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION CONSIDERS BOTH HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE COMPANY’S PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS AND STOCK OPTIONS IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS IS BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE AWARDS ON THE GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR PERFORMANCE RSUS REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITY THAT THE MARKET AND/OR PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS WILL BE MET.

THE FAIR VALUES OF LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY INTERNAL DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS THAT USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, WHICH IS MITIGATED BY MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERAL POSTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES.

LEVEL 2 BORROWINGS, WHICH INCLUDE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND U.S. MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, ARE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LEVEL 3 OTHER LIABILITIES REPRESENTS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION FOR MAKER AND IS DETERMINED BY A PROBABILITY WEIGHTING OF POTENTIAL PAYOUTS.

LEVEL 3 BORROWINGS, WHICH INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL THEME PARK BORROWINGS AND OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS, ARE GENERALLY VALUED BASED ON HISTORICAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS, PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES AND THE COMPANY’S CURRENT BORROWING COST AND CREDIT RISK.

THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ALSO INCLUDE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNT PAYABLE. THE CARRYING VALUES OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS APPROXIMATE THE FAIR VALUES.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS ASSETS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS WHEN THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS PROVIDE INDICATORS THAT THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED. IN ADDITION, WE COMPARE THE CARRYING VALUES OF OUR INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO FAIR VALUE ON AT LEAST AN ANNUAL BASIS. DURING FISCAL 2015, THE COMPANY RECORDED FILM PRODUCTION COST IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF

$65 MILLION

. AT

OCTOBER 3, 2015

, THE AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUE OF THE FILMS FOR WHICH WE PREPARED THE FAIR VALUE ANALYSES IN FISCAL 2015 WAS

$184 MILLION

. THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE REPORTED IN "COSTS OF SERVICES" IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE FILM IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REFLECTED THE EXCESS OF THE UNAMORTIZED COST OF THE IMPAIRED FILMS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS A LEVEL 3 VALUATION TECHNIQUE. DURING FISCAL 2014, RADIO FCC LICENSES WITH A CARRYING VALUE OF

$117 MILLION

WERE WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE OF

$71 MILLION

RESULTING IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF

$46 MILLION

, WHICH WAS RECORDED IN "RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES" IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE RADIO FCC LICENSE FAIR VALUES WERE DERIVED USING MARKET TRANSACTIONS, WHICH IS A LEVEL 3 VALUATION TECHNIQUE, AND WERE DETERMINED IN CONNECTION WITH A PLAN TO SELL RADIO DISNEY STATIONS.

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

THE COMPANY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS WITH, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE COUNTERPARTIES TO ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND DOES NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTIES.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT IT WOULD REALIZE A MATERIAL LOSS, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS OF

OCTOBER 3, 2015

, IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY SINGLE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. THE COMPANY GENERALLY ENTERS INTO DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ONLY WITH COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF A- OR BETTER AND REQUIRES COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A- OR AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED LIMITS AS DEFINED BY CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE MATERIAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATINGS. AS OF

OCTOBER 3, 2015

, THE COMPANY’S BALANCES WITH INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT

104

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXCEEDED 10% OF THE COMPANY’S TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE

31%

OF TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS COMPARED TO

43%

AS OF

SEPTEMBER 27, 2014.

THE COMPANY’S TRADE RECEIVABLES AND FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AT

OCTOBER 3, 2015

DUE TO THE WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS INTO WHICH THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS ARE SOLD, THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE COMPANY’S PORTFOLIO AMONG ISSUERS.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS RISKS RELATING TO ITS ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS ACCORDING TO A RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY. THE PRIMARY RISKS MANAGED WITH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTEREST RATE RISK AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS BORROWING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S OBJECTIVE IS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND ON THE MARKET VALUE OF ITS BORROWINGS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS ITS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY USES PAY-FLOATING AND PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO FACILITATE ITS INTEREST RATE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES PAY-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS EFFECTIVELY CONVERTING FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS TO VARIABLE RATE BORROWINGS INDEXED TO LIBOR. AS OF

OCTOBER 3, 2015

AND

SEPTEMBER 27,

THE COMPANY MAY DESIGNATE PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF INTEREST PAYMENTS ON FLOATING-RATE BORROWINGS. PAY-FIXED SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FLOATING RATE BORROWINGS TO FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS. THE UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THESE CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE DEFERRED IN AOCI AND RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST EXPENSE AS THE INTEREST PAYMENTS OCCUR. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF INTEREST PAYMENTS AT

OCTOBER 3, 2015

OR AT

SEPTEMBER 27, 2014

, AND GAINS AND LOSSES RELATED TO PAY-FIXED SWAPS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR FISCAL YEARS

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY TRANSACTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE COMPANY’S OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, ENABLING MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OPTION AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, FIRM COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY HEDGES ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS FOR PERIODS GENERALLY NOT TO EXCEED

FOUR

YEARS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM RANGE OF ANNUAL EXPOSURE. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED FORECASTED TRANSACTION, ASSET, LIABILITY OR FIRM COMMITMENT. THE PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, CANADIAN DOLLAR AND BRITISH POUND. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BORROWINGS INTO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS.

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FIRMLY COMMITTED AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. AS OF

OCTOBER 3, 2015

AND

SEPTEMBER 27, 2014

, THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANY’S NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE CASH FLOW HEDGES WERE

$6.5 BILLION

AND

$5.0 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS ARE DEFERRED IN AOCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS OCCUR, OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED RELATED TO INEFFECTIVENESS FOR FISCAL YEARS

2015

,

2014

AND

2013

WERE NOT MATERIAL. NET DEFERRED GAINS RECORDED IN AOCI THAT WILL BE RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS TOTALED

$346 MILLION.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AT

OCTOBER 3, 2015

WERE

$3.3 BILLION

AND

$4.3 BILLION

COMMODITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE VOLATILITY OF COMMODITIES PRICES, AND THE COMPANY DESIGNATES CERTAIN COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FORECASTED COMMODITY PURCHASES. MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS ARE DEFERRED IN AOCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS OCCUR, OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF COMMODITY PURCHASES. THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT AND FAIR VALUE OF THESE COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS AT

CONTINGENT FEATURES AND CASH COLLATERAL

THE COMPANY HAS MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS BY COUNTERPARTY WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT THAT A NET LIABILITY POSITION WITH A COUNTERPARTY EXCEEDS LIMITS DEFINED BY CONTRACT AND THAT VARY WITH THE COMPANY’S CREDIT RATING. IN ADDITION, THESE CONTRACTS MAY REQUIRE A COUNTERPARTY TO POST COLLATERAL TO THE COMPANY IN THE EVENT THAT A NET RECEIVABLE POSITION WITH A COUNTERPARTY EXCEEDS LIMITS DEFINED BY CONTRACT AND THAT VARY WITH THE COUNTERPARTY’S CREDIT RATING. IF THE COMPANY’S OR COUNTERPARTY’S CREDIT RATINGS WERE TO FALL BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, SUCH COUNTERPARTIES OR THE COMPANY WOULD ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A NET PAYMENT TO OR FROM THE COMPANY FOR THE AGGREGATE NET VALUE BY COUNTERPARTY OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WITH CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES IN A NET LIABILITY POSITION BY COUNTERPARTY WERE

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

IN MAY 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT REPLACES THE EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE GUIDANCE PROVIDES A FIVE STEP FRAMEWORK TO RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION IT EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE FASB HAS ISSUED EXPOSURE DRAFTS TO AMEND CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE GUIDANCE, INCLUDING REVENUE RECOGNITION ASSOCIATED WITH THE LICENSING OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE BEGINNING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE COMPANY’S 2019 FISCAL YEAR (WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED BEGINNING FISCAL YEAR 2018). THE GUIDANCE MAY BE ADOPTED EITHER BY RESTATING ALL YEARS PRESENTED IN THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR BY RECORDING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE YEAR OF ADOPTION. THE COMPANY IS ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THIS GUIDANCE WILL HAVE ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CONSOLIDATIONS

IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT AMENDS THE EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR CONSOLIDATION UNDER THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY AND VOTING INTEREST ENTITY MODELS. THE NEW GUIDANCE CHANGES THE ANALYSIS FOR DETERMINING WHETHER A FEE PAID TO A DECISION MAKER OR SERVICE PROVIDER IS A VARIABLE INTEREST. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS GUIDANCE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2015. THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
