ADVERTISING MEDIA.

THE COMPANYS TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS

ARE IN COMPETITION WITH OTHER TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS,

CABLE AND SATELLITE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING SERVICES,

VIDEOCASSETTES, DVDS AND OTHER ADVERTISING MEDIA SUCH AS

NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, BILLBOARDS AND THE INTERNET. COMPETITION

OCCURS PRIMARILY IN INDIVIDUAL MARKET AREAS. A TELEVISION OR

RADIO STATION IN ONE MARKET GENERALLY DOES NOT COMPETE DIRECTLY

WITH STATIONS IN OTHER MARKET AREAS.

THE GROWTH IN THE CABLE/SATELLITE INDUSTRYS

SHARE OF VIEWERS HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES

FOR ADVERTISING REVENUES. IN ADDITION, THE MARKET PLACE FOR THE

ACQUISITION OF SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING CONTINUES TO BE

COMPETITIVE. THE COMPANYS CABLE/SATELLITE NETWORKS ALSO

FACE COMPETITION FOR CARRIAGE BY CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICE

OPERATORS AND DISTRIBUTORS. THE COMPANYS CONTRACTUAL

AGREEMENTS WITH CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS ARE RENEWED OR

RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF

BUSINESS. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE UP

FOR RENEWAL IN THE NEXT 18 MONTHS. CONSOLIDATION IN THE

CABLE AND SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND

MAINTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS VARIOUS

CABLE AND SATELLITE PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE

AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE.

THE COMPANYS MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ALSO

COMPETES FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING.

THE MARKET FOR PROGRAMMING IS VERY COMPETITIVE, PARTICULARLY THE

MARKETS FOR SPORTS PROGRAMMING. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS SPORTS

RIGHTS AGREEMENTS WITH THE FOUR MAJOR PROFESSIONAL

FEDERAL REGULATION

TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY THE FCC UNDER FEDERAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934, AS

AMENDED. VIOLATION OF FCC REGULATIONS CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL

MONETARY FORFEITURES, LIMITED RENEWALS OF LICENSES AND, IN

EGREGIOUS CASES, DENIAL OF LICENSE RENEWAL OR REVOCATION OF A

LICENSE. FCC REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT

INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



LICENSING OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS.

EACH OF THE TELEVISION AND RADIO

STATIONS WE OWN MUST BE LICENSED BY THE FCC. THESE LICENSES ARE

GRANTED FOR PERIODS OF UP TO EIGHT YEARS, AND WE MUST OBTAIN

RENEWAL OF LICENSES AS THEY EXPIRE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE

OPERATING THE STATIONS. WE MUST ALSO OBTAIN FCC APPROVAL

WHENEVER WE SEEK TO HAVE A LICENSE TRANSFERRED IN CONNECTION

WITH THE ACQUISITION OF A STATION. THE FCC MAY DECLINE TO RENEW

OR APPROVE THE TRANSFER OF A LICENSE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE GENERALLY RECEIVED SUCH RENEWALS AND APPROVALS

IN THE PAST, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ALWAYS

OBTAIN NECESSARY RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE FUTURE.

TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP LIMITS.

THE FCC IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE

NUMBER OF TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A

SPECIFIC MARKET, ON THE COMBINED NUMBER OF TELEVISION AND RADIO

STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SINGLE MARKET AND ON THE AGGREGATE

PERCENTAGE OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE THAT CAN BE REACHED BY

TELEVISION STATIONS WE OWN. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003.



FCC REGULATIONS WOULD HAVE PERMITTED US TO OWN AN

ADDITIONAL TELEVISION STATION IN ALL OF THE 10 MARKETS IN WHICH

WE HAVE TELEVISION STATIONS, AND WE DID NOT OWN MORE THAN ONE

TELEVISION STATION IN ANY OF THOSE MARKETS.



FCC REGULATIONS WOULD HAVE PERMITTED OUR STATIONS

IN THE AGGREGATE TO REACH 35% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE

(ATTRIBUTING UHF TELEVISION STATIONS WITH ONLY 50% OF THE

TELEVISION HOUSEHOLDS IN THEIR MARKET). OUR STATIONS REACHED

APPROXIMATELY 24% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE CALCULATED USING THE

FCCS ATTRIBUTION RULE.



FCC REGULATIONS MAY IN SOME CASES IMPOSE

RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL RADIO OR

TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN RADIO

STATIONS, BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS ARE

MATERIAL TO OUR CURRENT BUSINESS PLANS.

THE FCC RECENTLY ADOPTED CHANGES TO THESE RULES

THAT WOULD GENERALLY PERMIT ENTITIES TO OWN MORE TELEVISION AND

RADIO STATIONS IN SOME MARKETS AND ALLOW A SINGLE ENTITY TO OWN

TELEVISION STATIONS THAT IN THE AGGREGATE REACH A LARGER

PERCENTAGE OF THE TOTAL NATIONAL AUDIENCE. THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

THE NEW RULES HAS, HOWEVER, BEEN STAYED BY A FEDERAL COURT

ORDER, AND CONGRESS IS CONSIDERING A NUMBER OF MEASURES TO

REPEAL OR PREVENT IMPLEMENTATION OF SOME OR ALL OF THE NEW RULES.



DUAL NETWORKS.

FCC

RULES CURRENTLY PROHIBIT ANY OF THE FOUR MAJOR TELEVISION

NETWORKS  ABC, CBS, FOX AND NBC  FROM BEING UNDER

COMMON OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL. THE NEW FCC RULES, IF IMPLEMENTED,

WOULD NOT MODIFY THIS LIMITATION.



REGULATION OF

PROGRAMMING.

THE FCC REGULATES

PROGRAMMING BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BANNING INDECENT

PROGRAMMING AND IMPOSING RESTRICTIONS AND COMMERCIAL TIME LIMITS

ON POLITICAL ADVERTISING. FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND FCC RULES ALSO

LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL MATTER THAT MAY BE BROADCAST

DURING PROGRAMMING DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN 12 YEARS OF AGE

AND YOUNGER AND GENERALLY REQUIRE A MINIMUM OF THREE HOURS PER

WEEK OF PROGRAMMING THAT HAS AS A SIGNIFICANT

PURPOSE MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF

CHILDREN 17 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. FCC RULES ALSO GIVE

TELEVISION STATION OWNERS THE RIGHT TO REJECT OR REFUSE NETWORK

PROGRAMMING IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO SUBSTITUTE

PROGRAMMING THAT THE LICENSEE REASONABLY BELIEVES TO BE OF

GREATER LOCAL OR NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.



CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF BROADCAST

TELEVISION STATIONS.

WITH RESPECT TO

CABLE SYSTEMS LOCATED WITHIN A TELEVISION STATIONS DMA,

FCC RULES REQUIRE THAT EVERY THREE YEARS EACH TELEVISION STATION

ELECT EITHER MUST CARRY STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH

CABLE OPERATORS MUST CARRY A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION IN THE

STATIONS MARKET, OR RETRANSMISSION CONSENT

STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE CABLE OPERATOR IS REQUIRED TO

NEGOTIATE WITH THE TELEVISION STATION TO OBTAIN THE CONSENT OF

THE TELEVISION STATION FOR CARRIAGE OF ITS SIGNAL. UNDER THE

SATELLITE HOME IMPROVEMENT ACT, SATELLITE CARRIERS ARE PERMITTED

TO RETRANSMIT A LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS SIGNAL INTO ITS

LOCAL MARKET WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LOCAL TELEVISION STATION.

IF A SATELLITE CARRIER ELECTS TO CARRY ONE LOCAL STATION IN A

MARKET, THE SATELLITE CARRIER MUST CARRY THE SIGNALS OF ALL

LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS THAT ALSO REQUEST CARRIAGE.



DIGITAL TELEVISION.

FCC RULES CURRENTLY REQUIRE FULL-POWER

ANALOG TELEVISION STATIONS, SUCH AS OURS, TO PROVIDE DIGITAL

SERVICE ON A SECOND BROADCAST CHANNEL GRANTED SPECIFICALLY FOR

THE PHASE-IN OF DIGITAL BROADCASTING. FCC RULES ALSO REGULATE

DIGITAL BROADCASTING TO ENSURE CONTINUED QUALITY CARRIAGE OF

MANDATED FREE OVER-THE-AIR PROGRAM SERVICE. ALL OF THE

COMPANYS STATIONS HAVE LAUNCHED DIGITAL FACILITIES AND WE

ARE EVALUATING VARIOUS OPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO USE OF DIGITAL

CHANNELS. ALL BROADCASTERS ARE REQUIRED TO OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY

IN DIGITAL

MODE AND SURRENDER THE ADDITIONAL CHANNEL BY

DECEMBER 31, 2006, BUT THE FCC HAS THE AUTHORITY TO EXTEND

THIS DEADLINE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND IS EXPECTED TO DO SO

IN MOST MARKETS BECAUSE THE NUMBER OF HOUSEHOLDS RECEIVING A

DIGITAL SIGNAL IS NOT LIKELY TO EXCEED 85% BY THE DEADLINE.

THE FOREGOING IS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF CERTAIN

PROVISIONS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND OTHER LEGISLATION AND

OF SPECIFIC FCC RULES AND POLICIES. THIS SUMMARY FOCUSES ON

PROVISIONS MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE TO

RELATIONSHIP WITH PIXAR

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FEATURE FILM AGREEMENT

WITH PIXAR IN 1991, WHICH RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF ITS FIRST

FILM WITH PIXAR,

TOY STORY,

IN NOVEMBER 1995. IN 1997,

THE COMPANY EXTENDED ITS RELATIONSHIP WITH PIXAR BY ENTERING

INTO A CO-PRODUCTION AGREEMENT, UNDER WHICH PIXAR AGREED TO

PRODUCE, ON AN EXCLUSIVE BASIS, FIVE ORIGINAL COMPUTER-ANIMATED

FEATURE FILMS FOR DISTRIBUTION BY THE COMPANY. BOTH PARTIES

AGREED TO CO-FINANCE AND CO-BRAND THE FILMS AND SHARE EQUALLY IN

COMPETITION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

PROTECTION

THE SUCCESS OF STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT OPERATIONS IS

HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON PUBLIC TASTE AND PREFERENCES, WHICH ARE

UNPREDICTABLE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE. IN ADDITION, STUDIO

ENTERTAINMENT OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND

PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT

AND TELEVISION MARKETS. RELEASE DATES ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL

FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF VACATION AND

HOLIDAY PERIODS.

THE STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH

ALL FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPANIES

PRODUCE AND/OR DISTRIBUTE THEATRICAL AND TELEVISION FILMS,

EXPLOIT PRODUCTS IN THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET, PROVIDE PAY

TELEVISION PROGRAMMING SERVICES AND SPONSOR LIVE THEATER. WE

ALSO COMPETE TO OBTAIN CREATIVE AND PERFORMING TALENTS, STORY

PROPERTIES, ADVERTISER SUPPORT, BROADCAST RIGHTS AND MARKET

SHARE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR STUDIO

ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE AND

EXPLOIT ITS MOTION PICTURE AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING IS

AFFECTED BY THE STRENGTH AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY PROTECTIONS IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD.

EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES, REGULATORY LIMITATIONS ON INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY PROTECTION, LACK OF ENFORCEMENT OF PROTECTIVE LAWS IN

SOME JURISDICTIONS AND CLAIMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

INFRINGEMENT ALL CREATE RISKS AND ADDED COSTS THAT CAN ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE OPERATION AND RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS STUDIO

ENTERTAINMENT OPERATIONS, DESPITE THE COMPANYS STRONG

EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THROUGHOUT

THE UNITED STATES AND IN OTHER KEY MARKETS. SEE FURTHER

FURNISHINGS AND ELECTRONICS, STATIONARY AND PERSONAL CARE;

PROPERTY PROTECTION

THE COMPANY COMPETES IN ITS CHARACTER

MERCHANDISING AND OTHER LICENSING, PUBLISHING, INTERACTIVE AND

RETAIL ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER LICENSORS, PUBLISHERS AND RETAILERS

OF CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES. ALTHOUGH PUBLIC

INFORMATION IS LIMITED, WE BELIEVE THE COMPANY IS THE LARGEST

WORLDWIDE LICENSOR OF CHARACTER-BASED MERCHANDISE AND

PRODUCER/DISTRIBUTOR OF CHILDRENS FILM-RELATED PRODUCTS.

OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE LICENSING AND RETAIL DISTRIBUTION

BUSINESS ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR

AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF ANIMATED THEATRICAL

RELEASES.

THE COMPANYS LICENSING BUSINESSES, AS WELL

AS ITS STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT AND THEME PARK AND RESORT

OPERATIONS, ARE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

EXPLOIT AND PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING

TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS AND TRADE SECRETS,

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AS A RESULT, DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LAWS

PROMOTING OR LIMITING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY HAVE

SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. IN THE

UNITED STATES, FOR EXAMPLE, THE 1998 SONNY BONO COPYRIGHT TERM

EXTENSION ACT PROVIDED EXTENDED COPYRIGHT PROTECTION FOR CERTAIN

OLDER PROPERTIES CURRENTLY LICENSED OR OTHERWISE EXPLOITED BY

THE COMPANY, WHICH OTHERWISE MIGHT LOSE SUCH PROTECTION IN THE

NEAR FUTURE. EARLIER THIS YEAR, THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS

ACT WAS UPHELD BY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT IN WASHINGTON D.C. THUS

EXTENDING THE TERM OF COPYRIGHT IN THE UNITED STATES BY TWENTY

YEARS.

COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK PROTECTIONS ARE LIMITED

OR EVEN UNAVAILABLE IN SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND PREVENTING

UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE COMPANYS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES

CAN BE DIFFICULT EVEN IN COUNTRIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL

PROTECTIONS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGIES HAVE FACILITATED

PIRACY OF THE COMPANYS COPYRIGHTED WORKS, INCLUDING MOTION

PICTURES, TELEVISION PROGRAMMING AND SOUND RECORDINGS, BY SUCH

MEANS AS INTERNET PEER-TO-PEER FILE SHARING AND PERSONAL VIDEO

RECORDERS THAT PERMIT AD STRIPPING AND THE UNAUTHORIZED COPYING

OF MOTION PICTURES AND TELEVISION PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY DEVOTES

SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO PROTECTING ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES

IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER KEY FOREIGN MARKETS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES THAT

RELY ON THE EXPLOITATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARE SUBJECT TO

THE RISK OF CHALLENGES BY THIRD PARTIES CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT OF

THEIR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.

WITH ITS FORMER PRESIDENT, MICHAEL S. OVITZ, WAS VOID, OR

ALTERNATIVELY THAT MR. OVITZS TERMINATION SHOULD BE

PLAINTIFFS SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE COURTS OPINION. THE PLAINTIFFS FILED

THEIR AMENDED COMPLAINT ON JANUARY 3, 2002. ON

FEBRUARY 6, 2003, THE COMPANYS DIRECTORS MOTION

TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS CONVERTED BY THE COURT TO A

MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND THE PLAINTIFFS WERE PERMITTED TO

AMENDED COMPLAINT ON APRIL 1, 2003. ON MAY 28, 2003,

THE COURT (TREATING AS A MOTION TO DISMISS THE MOTION FOR

SUMMARY JUDGMENT INTO WHICH IT HAD CONVERTED THE ORIGINAL MOTION

ON FEBRUARY 6, 2003) DENIED THE DIRECTORS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT. THE PARTIES ARE CONDUCTING

IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES

COUNTY, BEGINNING WITH A CLAIM FILED BY RICHARD AND DAVID KAPLAN

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY

COMPANY.

IN THIS LAWSUIT, FILED ON

FEBRUARY 27, 1991 AND PENDING IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY

SUPERIOR COURT, THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT A COMPANY SUBSIDIARY

DEFRAUDED IT AND BREACHED A 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH

RESPECT TO CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH PROPERTIES, BY FAILING TO

ACCOUNT FOR AND PAY ROYALTIES ON REVENUES EARNED FROM THE SALE

OF WINNIE THE POOH MOVIES ON VIDEOCASSETTE AND FROM THE

EXPLOITATION OF WINNIE THE POOH MERCHANDISING RIGHTS. THE

PLAINTIFF SEEKS DAMAGES FOR THE LICENSEES ALLEGED BREACHES

AS WELL AS CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAINTIFFS INTERPRETATION

OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE ACTIVITIES.

THE PLAINTIFF ALSO SEEKS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT ON

THE BASIS OF THE ALLEGED BREACHES. THE COMPANY DISPUTES THAT THE

PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER RELIEF OF ANY

KIND, INCLUDING TERMINATION OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT. IF EACH

OF THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS WERE TO BE CONFIRMED IN A FINAL

JUDGMENT, DAMAGES AS ARGUED BY THE PLAINTIFF COULD TOTAL AS MUCH

AS SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE

VALUE TO THE COMPANY OF ANY FUTURE EXPLOITATION OF THE LICENSED

RIGHTS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES AND THE

UNCERTAINTY OF THEIR ULTIMATE DISPOSITION, MANAGEMENT IS UNABLE

TO PREDICT THE MAGNITUDE OF ANY POTENTIAL DETERMINATION OF THE

PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS. ON APRIL 24, 2003, THE MATTER WAS

REMOVED TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL

DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, WHICH, ON MAY 19, 2003, DISMISSED

CERTAIN CLAIMS AND REMANDED THE MATTER TO THE LOS ANGELES

SUPERIOR COURT. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED FROM THE DISTRICT

COURTS ORDER TO THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH

CIRCUIT. IN THE MEANWHILE, THE SUPERIOR COURT HAS ASSIGNED THE

OVERVIEW

OUR INCOME BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

ACCOUNTING CHANGE WAS $1.3 BILLION IN FISCAL 2003, WHICH WAS

$102 MILLION, OR 8%, HIGHER THAN IN FISCAL 2002. THIS

REPRESENTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE OF $0.65, WHICH WAS $0.05 HIGHER

THAN IN FISCAL 2002. WE MADE AN ACCOUNTING CHANGE EFFECTIVE AS

OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2003 TO ADOPT A NEW ACCOUNTING RULE

FOR MULTIPLE ELEMENT REVENUE ACCOUNTING (EITF 00-21, SEE NOTE 2

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), WHICH IMPACTED THE

TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION RELATED TO NFL FOOTBALL

PROGRAMMING AT ESPN. THIS CHANGE RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE EFFECT

CHARGE TOTALING $71 MILLION. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

INCLUDING THE EFFECT OF THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE WERE $0.62 FOR

FISCAL 2003.

RESULTS FOR THE CURRENT YEAR INCLUDED A WRITE-OFF

OF AN AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT WITH UNITED AIRLINES

($114 MILLION PRE-TAX OR $0.04 PER SHARE), A PRE-TAX GAIN

OF $16 MILLION ON THE SALE OF THE ANAHEIM ANGELS AND

RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $16 MILLION AT THE

DISNEY STORE, AS DESCRIBED MORE FULLY UNDER CONSUMER PRODUCTS,

BELOW. ADDITIONALLY, THE CURRENT YEAR INCLUDED A BENEFIT FROM

THE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT OF CERTAIN STATE TAX ISSUES

($56 MILLION OR $0.03 PER SHARE). RESULTS FOR THE PRIOR

YEAR INCLUDED A PRE-TAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF SHARES OF

KNIGHT-RIDDER, INC. ($216 MILLION OR $0.06 PER SHARE) AND A

PRE-TAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE DISNEY STORE BUSINESS IN JAPAN

($34 MILLION OR $0.01 PER SHARE).

EXCLUDING THE AFOREMENTIONED ITEMS, THE INCREASE

IN NET INCOME FOR FISCAL 2003 WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF

INCREASED SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AT OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT

AND MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENTS AND INCREASED EQUITY IN THE INCOME

OF CABLE INVESTEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SEGMENT OPERATING

INCOME AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS

SEGMENT, HIGHER CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES AND

INCREASED NET INTEREST EXPENSE. CHANGES IN SEGMENT OPERATING

INCOME ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN THE SEPARATE SECTIONS BELOW.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE INCREASE IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE REFLECTS

LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE DUE TO LOWER INTEREST RATES AND AVERAGE

DEBT BALANCES, OFFSET BY HIGHER INVESTMENT LOSSES. THE

INVESTMENT LOSSES IN FISCAL 2003 INCLUDED THE $114 MILLION

WRITE-OFF OF OUR LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT WITH UNITED AIRLINES

REFERRED TO ABOVE. IN CONTRAST, FISCAL 2002 INCLUDED THE

$216 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF KNIGHT-RIDDER, INC. SHARES

REFERRED TO ABOVE.

EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES

THE INCREASE IN EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF OUR

INVESTEES REFLECTED INCREASES AT LIFETIME TELEVISION, DUE TO

LOWER ADVERTISING EXPENSES, AS WELL AS INCREASES AT A&E AND

E! ENTERTAINMENT DUE TO HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUES. IN

ADDITION, A WRITE-DOWN OF AN INVESTMENT IN A LATIN AMERICAN

CABLE OPERATOR NEGATIVELY AFFECTED PRIOR-YEAR EQUITY INCOME.

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED FROM

38.9% IN FISCAL 2002 TO 35.0% IN FISCAL 2003. THE DECREASE IN

THE CURRENT YEAR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A

REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE DUE TO A $56 MILLION

RESERVE RELEASE AS A RESULT OF THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF

CERTAIN PRIOR-YEAR STATE INCOME TAX EXPOSURES. AS MORE FULLY

DISCLOSED IN NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

THE CURRENT YEAR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE REFLECTS A $71

MILLION BENEFIT FOR CERTAIN INCOME EXCLUSIONS PROVIDED FOR UNDER

U.S. INCOME TAX LAWS. THESE INCOME EXCLUSIONS ARE UNDER REVIEW

AND IF THEY WERE TO BE REPEALED WITHOUT THE ENACTMENT OF

LEGISLATION REPLACING A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE CURRENT

BENEFIT, THERE WOULD BE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

INCOME TAX EXPENSE GOING FORWARD.

PENSION AND BENEFIT COSTS

INCREASING PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL

BENEFIT PLAN COSTS HAVE AFFECTED RESULTS IN ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS,

WITH THE MAJORITY OF THESE COSTS BEING BORNE BY THE PARKS AND

RESORTS SEGMENT. THE COSTS INCREASED FROM $71 MILLION IN

FISCAL 2002 TO $131 MILLION IN FISCAL 2003. THE INCREASE IN

FISCAL 2003 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE USED TO

MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS, A LOWER EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE OF

PLAN ASSETS. FOR FISCAL 2003 EXPENSE, THE DISCOUNT RATE

ASSUMPTION DECREASED FROM 7.50% TO 7.20% REFLECTING THE DECLINE

IN OVERALL MARKET INTEREST RATES AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS WAS REDUCED FROM 9.50% TO 8.50% REFLECTING TRENDS IN THE

OVERALL FINANCIAL MARKETS.

WE EXPECT PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL

COSTS TO INCREASE FURTHER IN FISCAL 2004 TO $375 MILLION.

THE INCREASE IS DUE PRIMARILY TO A FURTHER DECREASE IN THE

DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION AND A FURTHER REDUCTION IN THE EXPECTED

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. FOR FISCAL 2004 EXPENSE, THE DISCOUNT

RATE ASSUMPTION IS DECREASING FROM 7.20% TO 5.85%, REFLECTING

THE FURTHER DECLINE IN PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES. OUR

LONG-TERM EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS HAS BEEN

REDUCED FROM 8.50% FOR FISCAL 2003 TO 7.50% FOR FISCAL 2004.

CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PENSION PLANS ARE

EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN FISCAL 2004 TO APPROXIMATELY

$130 MILLION FROM $25 MILLION IN FISCAL 2003.

OVER THE PAST FEW YEARS, THE VALUE OF ASSETS IN

THE PLANS HAVE DECLINED IN LINE WITH THE PERFORMANCE OF THE

FINANCIAL MARKETS GENERALLY. THIS SITUATION COMBINED WITH THE

INCREASE IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF PENSION OBLIGATIONS RESULTS IN

PENSION OBLIGATIONS EXCEEDING THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS FOR

CERTAIN OF THE PENSION PLANS. IN THIS CIRCUMSTANCE, THE

ACCOUNTING RULES REQUIRE THAT WE RECORD AN IMMEDIATE ADJUSTMENT

TO REFLECT THE UNFUNDED ACCUMULATED PENSION OBLIGATION.

ACCORDINGLY, AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED

AN ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT TOTALING

$899 MILLION ($564 MILLION AFTER TAX; SEE NOTE 9 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THE ACCOUNTING RULES

REQUIRE THAT THIS AFTER-TAX ADJUSTMENT BE RECORDED AS A

REDUCTION OF EQUITY BY CHARGING ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME RATHER THAN AS A CURRENT YEAR EXPENSE.

2002 VS. 2001

OVERVIEW

INCOME BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING

CHANGE FOR FISCAL 2002 WAS $1.2 BILLION, COMPARED TO

$120 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE WAS $0.60 IN

FISCAL 2002 AS COMPARED TO $0.11 IN FISCAL 2001.

RESULTS IN FISCAL 2002 INCLUDED A PRE-TAX GAIN

($216 MILLION OR $0.06 PER SHARE) ON THE SALE OF THE

REMAINING SHARES OF KNIGHT-RIDDER, INC., A PRE-TAX GAIN ON THE

SALE OF THE DISNEY STORE BUSINESS IN JAPAN ($34 MILLION OR

$0.01 PER SHARE), THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OF ABC FAMILY (WHICH

WAS ACQUIRED ON OCTOBER 24, 2001), INCREMENTAL INTEREST

EXPENSE FOR BORROWINGS RELATED TO THAT ACQUISITION AND THE

CESSATION OF AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 142 EFFECTIVE

OCTOBER 1, 2001. RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2001 INCLUDED

RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ($1.5 BILLION OR $0.52 PER

SHARE) AND THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES

($278 MILLION OR $0.13 PER SHARE). EARNINGS AND EARNINGS

PER SHARE ATTRIBUTED TO DISNEY COMMON STOCK BEFORE THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND ADJUSTED FOR THE

IMPACT OF SFAS 142 FOR FISCAL 2001 WERE $891 MILLION AND

$0.42, RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION TO THE ITEMS DISCUSSED ABOVE, FISCAL

2002 RESULTS REFLECTED LOWER SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME IN OUR

MEDIA NETWORKS AND PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENTS, LOWER EQUITY IN

THE INCOME OF INVESTEES AND HIGHER NET INTEREST EXPENSE,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME IN THE

STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT. CHANGES IN SEGMENT OPERATING

INCOME ARE DISCUSSED IN DETAIL IN THE SEPARATE SECTIONS BELOW.

EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES

LOWER EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES REFLECTED

THE WRITE-DOWN OF AN INVESTMENT IN A LATIN AMERICAN CABLE

OPERATOR, DECREASES AT THE CABLE INVESTMENTS RESULTING FROM THE

SOFT ADVERTISING MARKET AND HIGHER ADVERTISING COSTS AT LIFETIME

TELEVISION.

NET INTEREST EXPENSE

NET INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO

$453 MILLION IN FISCAL 2002 AS COMPARED TO

$417 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001 DUE TO INCREMENTAL BORROWINGS

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ABC FAMILY ACQUISITION. HIGHER INTEREST

EXPENSE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INVESTMENT INCOME DUE

TO THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF KNIGHT-RIDDER SHARES.

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED FROM

82.5% IN FISCAL 2001 TO 38.9% IN FISCAL 2002. THE FISCAL 2001

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS HIGHER DUE TO NONDEDUCTIBLE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT WERE

RECORDED DURING THAT YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, FISCAL 2001 HAD MUCH

HIGHER NON DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL AMORTIZATION AS THE COMPANY

CEASED AMORTIZING GOODWILL IN FISCAL 2002.

FISCAL 2001 RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES

THE COMPANY RECORDED RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED

SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, WHICH PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CLOSURE

OF THE GO.COM PORTAL BUSINESSES, IMPAIRMENTS OF INTERNET

INVESTMENTS, A COMPANY-WIDE WORKFORCE REDUCTION AND THE CLOSURE

OF THE DISNEYQUEST FACILITY IN CHICAGO AND CERTAIN DISNEY STORES

IN NORTH AMERICA. THE MAJORITY OF THESE WERE NON-CASH CHARGES.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 THERE WERE NO REMAINING RESERVE

BALANCES OUTSTANDING OR CASH FLOW REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THESE

CHARGES.

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS

OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AND

MANAGEMENT USES AGGREGATE SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AS A MEASURE

OF THE PERFORMANCE OF OPERATING BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THAT AGGREGATE SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME ASSISTS INVESTORS BY

ALLOWING THEM TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN THE OPERATING RESULTS OF

THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES SEPARATE FROM FACTORS

OTHER THAN BUSINESS OPERATIONS THAT AFFECT NET INCOME. THE

REVENUES

MEDIA NETWORKS REVENUES INCREASED 12%, OR

$1.2 BILLION, TO $10.9 BILLION. THE INCREASE REFLECTED

AN INCREASE OF 7%, OR $360 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING AND AN

INCREASE OF 18%, OR $848 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS.

INCREASED BROADCASTING REVENUES WERE DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY AN INCREASE OF $196 MILLION AT THE ABC

TELEVISION NETWORK, $60 MILLION AT THE COMPANYS OWNED

AND OPERATED TELEVISION STATIONS AND $33 MILLION AT THE

RADIO NETWORKS AND STATIONS. THE INCREASES AT THE TELEVISION

NETWORK AND STATIONS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER ADVERTISING

REVENUES REFLECTING HIGHER RATES DUE TO AN IMPROVED ADVERTISING

MARKETPLACE. THE AIRING OF THE SUPER BOWL IN THE SECOND QUARTER

OF THE CURRENT YEAR ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED ADVERTISING

REVENUES. REVENUES AT THE RADIO NETWORKS AND STATIONS ALSO

INCREASED DUE TO THE STRONGER ADVERTISING MARKET.

INCREASED CABLE NETWORKS REVENUES WERE DRIVEN BY

INCREASES OF $455 MILLION IN REVENUES FROM CABLE AND

SATELLITE OPERATORS AND $385 MILLION IN ADVERTISING

REVENUES. INCREASED ADVERTISING REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY A RESULT

OF THE ADDITION OF NBA GAMES. REVENUES FROM CABLE AND SATELLITE

OPERATORS ARE LARGELY DERIVED FROM FEES CHARGED ON A PER

SUBSCRIBER BASIS, AND THE INCREASES IN THE CURRENT YEAR

REFLECTED BOTH CONTRACTUAL RATE ADJUSTMENTS AND SUBSCRIBER

GROWTH. THE COMPANYS CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH CABLE

AND SATELLITE OPERATORS ARE RENEWED OR RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO

TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF

THESE ARRANGEMENTS WILL BE UP FOR RENEWAL IN THE NEXT

18 MONTHS. CONSOLIDATION IN THE CABLE AND SATELLITE

DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS

FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS VARIOUS CABLE AND SATELLITE

PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN

PLACE. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR, REVENUES FROM CABLE NETWORKS COULD

INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN IN THE PAST OR COULD BE STABLE OR

DECLINE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR THIS SEGMENT CONSIST

PRIMARILY OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS COSTS AND AMORTIZATION,

PRODUCTION COSTS, DISTRIBUTION AND SELLING EXPENSES AND LABOR

COSTS. COSTS AND EXPENSES INCREASED 11%, OR $981 MILLION,

OVER FISCAL 2002 DUE TO HIGHER PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER BAD DEBT EXPENSE AT THE CABLE

NETWORKS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRIOR YEAR BENEFITED FROM THE

RECEIPT OF INSURANCE PROCEEDS RELATED TO THE LOSS OF A BROADCAST

TOWER.

HIGHER PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS AT THE

ABC TELEVISION NETWORK WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE AIRING OF THE

SUPER BOWL AND THE COSTS OF COVERAGE OF THE WAR IN IRAQ. HIGHER

PROGRAMMING COSTS AT THE CABLE NETWORKS WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO

NBA AND MLB TELECASTS AND HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS AT ABC

FAMILY. PROGRAMMING COST INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

LOWER COST AMORTIZATION FOR THE NFL CONTRACT DUE TO COMMENCING

THE THREE YEAR OPTION PERIOD AS DESCRIBED UNDER SPORTS

PROGRAMMING COSTS, BELOW. THE DECREASE IN BAD DEBT EXPENSE

AT CABLE NETWORKS REFLECTED NEGATIVE IMPACTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR

RELATED TO FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OF ADELPHIA COMMUNICATIONS

COMPANY (ADELPHIA) IN THE UNITED STATES AND KIRCHMEDIA &

COMPANY (KIRCH) IN GERMANY.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 23%, OR

$227 MILLION, TO $1.2 BILLION. THE INCREASE REFLECTED

INCREASES OF $74 MILLION AT BROADCASTING AND $153 MILLION

AT THE CABLE NETWORKS. INCREASED SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AT

BROADCASTING REFLECTED HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUES, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY INCREASED PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS. GROWTH AT

THE CABLE NETWORKS REFLECTED HIGHER REVENUES FROM CABLE AND

SATELLITE OPERATORS AND HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUE, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY INCREASED SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS.

SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS

THE INITIAL FIVE-YEAR PERIOD OF THE

COMPANYS CONTRACT TO TELEVISE NFL GAMES WAS NON-CANCELABLE

AND ENDED WITH THE TELECAST OF THE 2003 PRO BOWL. IN FEBRUARY

2003, THE NFL DID NOT EXERCISE ITS RENEGOTIATION OPTION AND AS A

RESULT, THE COMPANYS NFL CONTRACT WAS EXTENDED FOR AN

ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS ENDING WITH THE TELECAST OF THE 2006 PRO

BOWL. THE AGGREGATE FEE FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD WILL BE

$3.7 BILLION. ESPN RECOGNIZED THE COSTS OF THE INITIAL

FIVE-YEAR TERM OF THE CONTRACT AT LEVELS THAT INCREASED EACH

YEAR COMMENSURATE WITH INCREASING NFL REVENUES. AS A RESULT,

ESPN EXPERIENCED ITS HIGHEST LEVEL OF NFL PROGRAMMING COSTS

DURING FISCAL 2003. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONTRACT EXTENSION

WILL REDUCE FISCAL 2004 NFL COSTS BY APPROXIMATELY

$180 MILLION VERSUS FISCAL 2003, AND SUCH COSTS ARE

EXPECTED TO BE RELATIVELY LEVEL OVER THE REMAINING TWO YEARS OF

THE CONTRACT EXTENSION.

COST RECOGNITION FOR NFL PROGRAMMING AT THE ABC

TELEVISION NETWORK IN FISCAL 2004 IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE BY

$300 MILLION AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003. THE DECREASE AT

THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF

THE SUPER BOWL, WHICH WAS AIRED BY THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK IN

FISCAL 2003 AND WILL BE ABSENT IN FISCAL 2004, AS WELL AS FEWER

GAMES IN FISCAL 2004. THE ABSENCE OF THE SUPER BOWL AND THE

LOWER NUMBER OF GAMES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK WILL ALSO

RESULT IN LOWER REVENUE FROM NFL BROADCASTS IN FISCAL 2004.

DUE TO THE PAYMENT TERMS IN THE NFL CONTRACT,

THERE WILL BE APPROXIMATELY A $116 MILLION DECREASE IN CASH

PAYMENTS UNDER THE CONTRACT IN FISCAL 2004 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL

2003.

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS

FOR THE PURCHASE OF TELEVISION RIGHTS FOR SPORTS AND OTHER

PROGRAMMING, INCLUDING THE NFL, NBA, MLB, NHL AND VARIOUS

COLLEGE FOOTBALL CONFERENCE AND BOWL GAMES. THE COSTS OF THESE

CONTRACTS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. WE ENTER

INTO THESE CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT,

OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACTS, REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING DURING

THE PROGRAMMING AND AFFILIATE FEES WILL EXCEED THE COSTS OF THE

PROGRAMMING. WHILE CONTRACT COSTS MAY INITIALLY EXCEED

INCREMENTAL REVENUES AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OPERATING INCOME, IT

IS OUR EXPECTATION THAT THE COMBINED VALUE TO OUR SPORT NETWORKS

FROM ALL OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL RESULT IN LONG-TERM BENEFITS.

THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THESE CONTRACTS ON THE COMPANYS

-32-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS IS

DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF

ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE

SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES.

MEDIA NETWORKS

2002 VS. 2001

REVENUES

REVENUES INCREASED 2%, OR $164 MILLION, TO

$9.7 BILLION, REFLECTING A DECREASE OF 11%, OR

$645 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN

INCREASE OF 21%, OR $809 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS.

DECREASED BROADCASTING REVENUE WAS DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY A DECREASE OF $608 MILLION AT THE ABC TELEVISION

NETWORK AND $64 MILLION AT THE COMPANYS OWNED AND

OPERATED STATIONS. THE DECLINES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK

AND THE COMPANYS OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS WERE PRIMARILY

DRIVEN BY LOWER RATINGS AND LOWER ADVERTISING RATES.

INCREASES AT THE CABLE NETWORKS WERE DRIVEN BY AN

INCREASE OF $540 MILLION DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES FROM CABLE

AND SATELLITE OPERATORS AT ESPN AND DISNEY CHANNEL AND

APPROXIMATELY $342 MILLION DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF ABC

FAMILY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $19 MILLION IN

ADVERTISING REVENUES. REVENUES FROM CABLE AND SATELLITE

OPERATORS INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER RATES AT ESPN AND SUBSCRIBER

GROWTH AT BOTH ESPN AND THE INTERNATIONAL DISNEY CHANNELS. LOWER

ADVERTISING REVENUES WERE DUE TO THE SOFT ADVERTISING MARKET AND

LOWER REVENUES FROM ADELPHIA AND KIRCH AS A RESULT OF THEIR

FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES INCREASED 12%, OR

$936 MILLION, DRIVEN BY HIGHER SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS AT

ESPN, HIGHER BAD DEBT EXPENSE DUE TO THE FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES

OF ADELPHIA AND KIRCH AND INCREASED ADVERTISING COSTS AT THE

CABLE NETWORKS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COSTS AT THE INTERNET

GROUP AND PROCEEDS FROM AN INSURANCE SETTLEMENT.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 44%, OR

$772 MILLION, TO $1.0 BILLION, DRIVEN BY DECREASES OF

$732 MILLION AT BROADCASTING, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED

ADVERTISING REVENUES. CABLE OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 4%, OR

$40 MILLION, AS REVENUE GAINS WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY COST

INCREASES.

PARKS AND RESORTS

2003 VS. 2002

REVENUES

REVENUES AT PARKS AND RESORTS DECREASED 1%, OR

$53 MILLION, TO $6.4 BILLION. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY DECREASES OF $57 MILLION DUE TO THE SALE OF

THE ANAHEIM ANGELS BASEBALL TEAM DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF

FISCAL 2003, $51 MILLION FROM DECREASED REVENUES FROM EURO

DISNEY, AND $14 MILLION FROM THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT.

THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF

$83 MILLION AT THE DISNEYLAND RESORT. THE DECREASE IN

REVENUES FROM EURO DISNEY REFLECTED THE CESSATION OF BILLING AND

RECOGNITION OF REVENUES FROM ROYALTY AND MANAGEMENT FEES

COMMENCING WITH THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003 DUE TO EURO

DISNEYS FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES. THE COMPANY LIKELY WILL

NOT RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES IN

FISCAL 2004.

REVENUES AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT WERE

DOWN MARGINALLY AND REFLECTED LOWER THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND

HOTEL OCCUPANCY COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASED PER CAPITA GUEST SPENDING AT THE THEME PARKS AND HOTEL

PROPERTIES. DECREASED THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND HOTEL OCCUPANCY

AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT REFLECTED CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN

TRAVEL AND TOURISM.

-33-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GUEST SPENDING INCREASES REFLECTED TICKET PRICE

INCREASES AND FEWER PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS OFFERED DURING THE YEAR.

AT THE DISNEYLAND RESORT, INCREASED REVENUES WERE

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND HOTEL

OCCUPANCY. THESE INCREASES WERE DRIVEN BY THE SUCCESS OF CERTAIN

PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS OFFERED DURING THE YEAR, AS WELL AS THE

OPENING OF NEW ATTRACTIONS AND ENTERTAINMENT VENUES AT BOTH THE

DISNEYLAND PARK AND DISNEYS CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE DURING

THE CURRENT YEAR.

ACROSS OUR DOMESTIC THEME PARKS, ATTENDANCE AND

PER CAPITA GUEST SPENDING INCREASED 1% COMPARED TO THE PRIOR

YEAR. HOTEL OCCUPANCY WAS 77% ON 8,341,030 ROOMS IN FISCAL

2003 COMPARED TO 76% ON 8,533,135 ROOMS IN FISCAL 2002. PER

ROOM GUEST SPENDING WAS $210 AND $204 IN FISCAL 2003 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF

LABOR, COSTS OF MERCHANDISE, FOOD AND BEVERAGES SOLD,

DEPRECIATION, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, ENTERTAINMENT, MARKETING

AND SALES EXPENSE, INCREASED 3%, OR $159 MILLION COMPARED

TO THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE IN COSTS AND EXPENSES WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COSTS AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT

AND THE DISNEYLAND RESORT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COST DECREASES

DUE TO THE SALE OF THE ANAHEIM ANGELS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER.

HIGHER COSTS AT WALT DISNEY WORLD AND DISNEYLAND WERE PRIMARILY

DRIVEN BY HIGHER SPENDING ON EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, REPAIRS AND

MAINTENANCE, MARKETING, INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INSURANCE, AND

DEPRECIATION. EMPLOYEE BENEFITS COSTS IN FISCAL 2004 ARE

EXPECTED TO INCREASE DUE TO HIGHER FISCAL 2004 PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS AS DISCUSSED UNDER

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS, ABOVE.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 18%, OR

$212 MILLION, TO $957 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER

COSTS AND EXPENSES AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT AND THE

DECREASED REVENUES FROM EURO DISNEY. REVENUE INCREASES AT THE

DISNEYLAND RESORT WERE OFFSET BY HIGHER COSTS AND EXPENSES.

PARKS AND RESORTS

2002 VS. 2001

REVENUES

REVENUES DECREASED 8%, OR $539 MILLION, TO

$6.5 BILLION, DRIVEN BY DECREASES OF $496 MILLION AT

THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT, $40 MILLION AT THE DISNEYLAND

RESORT AND $24 MILLION AT DISNEY CRUISE LINE, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY INCREASED ROYALTIES OF $52 MILLION FROM THE TOKYO

DISNEY RESORT.

AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT, DECREASED

REVENUES REFLECTED LOWER ATTENDANCE, OCCUPANCY AND PER ROOM

GUEST SPENDING AT THE HOTEL PROPERTIES. THESE DECREASES WERE

DRIVEN BY DECREASES IN INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC VISITATION

RESULTING FROM CONTINUED DISRUPTION IN TRAVEL AND TOURISM AND

SOFTNESS IN THE ECONOMY. LOWER PER ROOM GUEST SPENDING AT THE

WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT WAS DRIVEN BY PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS.

AT THE DISNEYLAND RESORT, DECREASED REVENUES WERE

DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER PER CAPITA GUEST SPENDING AT THE THEME

PARKS AND AT THE HOTEL PROPERTIES. LOWER GUEST SPENDING AT THE

DISNEYLAND RESORT WAS DRIVEN BY TICKET AND OTHER PROMOTIONAL

PROGRAMS AS WELL AS A HIGHER MIX OF LOCAL GUESTS, WHO HAVE

HIGHER ANNUAL PASS USAGE AND TEND TO SPEND LESS PER VISIT.

THE INCREASED ROYALTIES AT TOKYO DISNEY RESORT

WERE DUE TO THE OPENING OF THE TOKYO DISNEYSEA THEME PARK AND

THE TOKYO DISNEYSEA HOTEL MIRACOSTA IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

FISCAL 2001.

THE DECLINE AT THE DISNEY STORE IS DUE PRIMARILY

TO THE SALE OF THE DISNEY STORE BUSINESS IN JAPAN IN THE PRIOR

YEAR, AS WELL AS LOWER COMPARATIVE STORE SALES AND FEWER STORES

IN NORTH AMERICA. THE INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE LICENSING

PRIMARILY REFLECTED HIGHER REVENUES FROM TOY LICENSEES, DUE IN

PART TO HIGHER CONTRACTUALLY GUARANTEED MINIMUM ROYALTIES IN

NORTH AMERICA, STRONG PERFORMANCE ACROSS EUROPE AND INCREASED

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

DISNEY STORES

THE COMPANY OPERATES 474 DISNEY STORES IN NORTH

IT WAS PURSUING STRATEGIC OPTIONS FOR THE DISNEY STORE,

INCLUDING THE

-36-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

POSSIBLE SALE OF STORES IN NORTH AMERICA AND

EUROPE, IN ORDER TO FOCUS ON ITS CORE COMPETENCIES AND

ACTIVITIES INTENDED TO INCREASE CAPITAL RETURNS. IN CONNECTION

WITH PREPARING THE CHAIN FOR SALE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CLOSE

A CERTAIN NUMBER OF UNDERPERFORMING STORES IN NORTH AMERICA.

DURING FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED CHARGES

TOTALING $16 MILLION, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING FIXED ASSET

WRITE-DOWNS RELATED TO THE STORES IT EXPECTS TO CLOSE (AND

CERTAIN RELATED FACILITIES) AND THE COST OF CERTAIN

ADMINISTRATIVE HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS. FIXED ASSETS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE STORES IDENTIFIED FOR CLOSURE HAVE BEEN WRITTEN DOWN TO

THEIR FAIR VALUE, DETERMINED ON THE BASIS OF ESTIMATED FUTURE

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THROUGH THE EXPECTED DATE OF THE CLOSURES.

THE CHARGES ARE REPORTED IN RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

AS STORE CLOSURES OCCUR, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO

INCUR ADDITIONAL CHARGES RELATED TO LEASE TERMINATION COSTS AND

OTHER ACTIONS THAT MAY BE TAKEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE

DISPOSITION OF THE STORES. TOTAL FUTURE BASE RENT COMMITMENTS

FOR THE DISNEY STORES IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $395 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003.

OF THESE COMMITMENTS, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE COMPANY WILL

BEAR THE COST OF THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE STORES THAT WILL BE

CLOSED, AND THAT A BUYER WOULD ASSUME THOSE ASSOCIATED WITH

STORES THAT ARE SOLD. TOTAL FUTURE BASE RENT COMMITMENTS FOR THE

STORES THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CLOSE WERE APPROXIMATELY

$54 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. IN CONJUNCTION

WITH THE SALE NEGOTIATIONS, THE COMPANY WILL UNDERTAKE

NEGOTIATIONS WITH LESSORS TO SEEK FAVORABLE LEASE TERMINATION

TERMS FOR STORES THAT WILL BE CLOSED, BUT WILL LIKELY INCUR

CHARGES RELATED TO THE LEASE TERMINATIONS IN THE SECOND AND

THIRD QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2004. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME

TO DETERMINE WHAT AMOUNT WILL ULTIMATELY BE PAID TO TERMINATE

THESE LEASES.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COMPANY WILL RECOVER

ITS INVESTMENT IN STORES THAT WILL BE SOLD; HOWEVER, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN STORES CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED FOR SALE MAY

ULTIMATELY BE CLOSED WHICH COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CHARGES.

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING FISCAL 2001, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED

APPROXIMATELY 63.9 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK

AND 1.8 MILLION SHARES OF INTERNET GROUP COMMON STOCK FOR

APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION AND $10 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. NO SHARES WERE REPURCHASED DURING FISCAL 2002 AND

FISCAL 2003. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THE COMPANY WAS

AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO APPROXIMATELY 330 MILLION

SHARES OF COMPANY COMMON STOCK.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH BALANCES, OTHER LIQUID

ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL

MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE

RESOURCES TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING

BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE

COMPANYS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL

MARKETS CAN BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS

CONTROL. IN ADDITION TO MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE

COMPANYS BORROWING COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT AND

LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES,

WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS

PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CERTAIN CREDIT MEASURES SUCH AS

INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. ON OCTOBER 4, 2002,

STANDARD & POORS RATINGS SERVICES LOWERED ITS

LONG-TERM RATINGS ON THE COMPANY TO BBB+. SUBSEQUENTLY, ON MARCH

20, 2003, STANDARD & POORS PLACED THE BBB+ LONG-TERM

CORPORATE CREDIT RATING OF THE COMPANY ON CREDIT WATCH WITH

NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS. ON DECEMBER 3, 2003, STANDARD &

POORS REMOVED THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM CREDIT RATING

FROM CREDIT WATCH WITH NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS AND AFFIRMED ITS

EXISTING BBB+ WITH A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK. AT THE SAME TIME,

STANDARD & POORS AFFIRMED ITS A-2 SHORT-TERM CORPORATE

CREDIT RATING ON THE COMPANY. ON OCTOBER 18, 2002,

MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE DOWNGRADED THE COMPANYS

LONG-TERM DEBT RATING TO BAA1 FROM A3, AFFIRMED THE P2

SHORT-TERM RATING AND INDICATED THAT OUR OUTLOOK WAS STABLE. THE

COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY ONE FINANCIAL

COVENANT, RELATING TO INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE COMPANY MET

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN.

CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS AND

CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE PAYMENTS OR

PROVIDE FUNDING IF CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR (CONTINGENT

COMMITMENTS). THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT

THESE CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS WILL RESULT IN ANY AMOUNTS BEING

PAID BY THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY HAS GUARANTEED CERTAIN SPECIAL

ASSESSMENT AND WATER/SEWER REVENUE BOND SERIES ISSUED BY THE

CELEBRATION COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT AND THE ENTERPRISE

COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT (COLLECTIVELY, THE DISTRICTS).

THE BOND PROCEEDS WERE USED BY THE DISTRICTS TO FINANCE THE

CONSTRUCTION OF INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS AND THE WATER AND

SEWER SYSTEM IN THE MIXED-USE, RESIDENTIAL COMMUNITY OF

CELEBRATION, FLORIDA. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THE REMAINING

DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATION GUARANTEED BY US WAS $103 MILLION, OF

WHICH $62 MILLION WAS PRINCIPAL. THE COMPANY IS RESPONSIBLE

TO SATISFY ANY SHORTFALLS IN DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS, DEBT SERVICE

AND MAINTENANCE RESERVE FUNDS, AND TO ENSURE COMPLIANCE WITH

SPECIFIED RATE COVENANTS. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY HAS TO

FUND PAYMENTS UNDER ITS GUARANTEES, THE DISTRICTS HAVE AN

OBLIGATION TO REIMBURSE THE COMPANY FROM DISTRICT REVENUES.

THE COMPANY HAS ALSO GUARANTEED CERTAIN BOND

ISSUANCES BY THE ANAHEIM PUBLIC AUTHORITY FOR A TOTAL OF

$111 MILLION. THE GUARANTEE ALSO EXTENDS TO FUTURE INTEREST

PAYMENTS THAT WILL TOTAL

-43-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

$296 MILLION OVER THE 40-YEAR LIFE OF THE

BOND. THE BOND PROCEEDS WERE USED BY THE CITY OF ANAHEIM TO

FINANCE CONSTRUCTION OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND A PUBLIC PARKING

FACILITY ADJACENT TO THE DISNEYLAND RESORT. REVENUES FROM SALES,

OCCUPANCY AND PROPERTY TAXES FROM THE DISNEYLAND RESORT AND

NON-DISNEY HOTELS ARE USED BY THE CITY OF ANAHEIM TO REPAY THE

BONDS. IN THE EVENT OF A DEBT SERVICE SHORTFALL, WE WILL BE

RESPONSIBLE TO FUND THE SHORTFALL. TO THE EXTENT THAT SUBSEQUENT

TAX REVENUES EXCEED THE DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS IN SUBSEQUENT

PERIODS, WE WOULD BE REIMBURSED FOR ANY PREVIOUSLY FUNDED

SHORTFALLS.

TO DATE, TAX REVENUES HAVE EXCEEDED THE DEBT

SERVICE PAYMENTS FOR BOTH THE CELEBRATION AND ANAHEIM BONDS.

THE COMPANY HAS GUARANTEED PAYMENT OF CERTAIN

FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT LEASES ON BEHALF OF A THIRD-PARTY SERVICE

PROVIDER THAT SUPPLIES THE COMPANY WITH BROADCASTING

TRANSMISSION, POST-PRODUCTION, STUDIO AND ADMINISTRATIVE

SERVICES IN THE U.K. IF THE THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDER

DEFAULTS ON THE LEASES, WE WOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

REMAINING OBLIGATION UNLESS WE FIND ANOTHER SERVICE PROVIDER TO

TAKE OVER THE LEASES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THE

REMAINING FACILITY AND EQUIPMENT LEASE OBLIGATION WAS

$72 MILLION. THESE LEASES EXPIRE IN MARCH 2014.

EURO

DISNEY

THE COMPANY HAS A 39% INTEREST IN EURO DISNEY

S.C.A., WHICH OPERATES THE DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN AND

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE FROM EURO DISNEY TOTALED

$494 MILLION, INCLUDING $117 MILLION DRAWN UNDER A

LINE OF CREDIT WHICH IS DUE IN JUNE 2004. THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT

AVAILABLE UNDER THE LINE IS 168 MILLION EUROS

($192 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 EXCHANGE RATES).

THE SLOWDOWN IN THE EUROPEAN TRAVEL AND TOURISM

INDUSTRY HAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED EURO DISNEYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW. IN RESPONSE TO THIS SITUATION, EURO

DISNEY INITIATED DISCUSSIONS WITH ITS LENDERS AND THE COMPANY TO

OBTAIN WAIVERS OF ITS FISCAL 2003 LOAN COVENANTS AND TO OBTAIN

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCING TO ADDRESS EURO DISNEYS CASH

REQUIREMENTS.

AS A RESULT OF AN AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO ON

MARCH 28, 2003, THE COMPANY DID NOT CHARGE EURO DISNEY

ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES FOR THE PERIOD FROM

JANUARY 1, 2003 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. DURING THE LAST

THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANYS ROYALTY AND

MANAGEMENT FEE INCOME FROM EURO DISNEY TOTALED $27 MILLION.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY AGREED TO ALLOW EURO DISNEY TO PAY ITS

ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES ANNUALLY IN ARREARS FOR FISCAL

2004, INSTEAD OF QUARTERLY.

ON NOVEMBER 3, 2003, EURO DISNEY OBTAINED

WAIVERS FROM ITS LENDERS, EFFECTIVE THROUGH MARCH 31, 2004,

WITH RESPECT TO COVENANTS FOR FISCAL 2003. THE AGREEMENT IS

EXPECTED TO GIVE EURO DISNEY, ITS LENDERS AND THE COMPANY TIME

TO FIND A RESOLUTION TO EURO DISNEYS FINANCIAL SITUATION.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BANK WAIVERS, THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED A

NEW 45 MILLION EUROS ($52 MILLION AT

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 EXCHANGE RATES) SUBORDINATED CREDIT

FACILITY, WHICH CAN BE DRAWN ON THROUGH MARCH 31, 2004 ONLY

AFTER EURO DISNEYS EXISTING LINE OF CREDIT WITH THE

COMPANY IS FULLY DRAWN. REPAYMENT OF ANY AMOUNT DRAWN DOWN ON

THE NEW CREDIT FACILITY IS SUBJECT TO EURO DISNEY MEETING

CERTAIN FINANCIAL THRESHOLDS OR THE PRIOR REPAYMENT OF ALL OF

EURO DISNEYS EXISTING DEBT TO ITS LENDERS.

EURO DISNEY IS CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS

WITH ITS AGENT BANKS AND THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN SUPPLEMENTAL

FINANCING TO ADDRESS ITS CASH REQUIREMENTS. SUCH FINANCING MAY

INCLUDE AN EXTENSION OR CHANGE IN THE TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANYS CREDIT LINE OR ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS FROM THE

COMPANY. IF A RESOLUTION TO EURO DISNEYS FUTURE FINANCING

NEEDS IS NOT OBTAINED BY MARCH 31, 2004, THE WAIVERS WOULD

EXPIRE AND EURO DISNEYS LENDERS COULD ACCELERATE THE

MATURITY OF EURO DISNEYS DEBT. SHOULD THAT OCCUR, EURO

DISNEY WOULD BE UNABLE TO MEET ALL OF ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT EURO DISNEY WILL ULTIMATELY OBTAIN THE

REQUISITE LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL FINANCING; HOWEVER,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL BE THE CASE. SHOULD

EURO DISNEY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND/OR

ADDITIONAL FINANCING, SOME OR ALL OF THE COMPANYS

$494 MILLION EURO DISNEY INVESTMENT AND RECEIVABLES WOULD

LIKELY BECOME IMPAIRED.

-44-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADDITIONALLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FINANCING

MODIFICATIONS AND/OR THE FORM OF THE RESOLUTION COULD RESULT IN

A PARTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THE COMPANYS EURO DISNEY

INVESTMENT AND RECEIVABLES.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, EURO DISNEY HAD,

ON A US GAAP BASIS, TOTAL ASSETS OF $3.4 BILLION AND TOTAL

LIABILITIES OF $3.3 BILLION, INCLUDING BORROWINGS TOTALING

$2.5 BILLION. SEE NOTES 2 AND 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATED TO EURO

DISNEYS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS

WELL AS THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46.

IN CONNECTION WITH A FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF

EURO DISNEY IN 1994, EURO DISNEY ASSOCIÉS S.N.C. (DISNEY

SNC), A WHOLLY OWNED AFFILIATE OF THE COMPANY, ENTERED INTO A

LEASE ARRANGEMENT WITH A FINANCING COMPANY WITH A NONCANCELABLE

TERM OF 12 YEARS RELATED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE

DISNEYLAND PARK ASSETS, AND THEN ENTERED INTO A 12-YEAR SUBLEASE

AGREEMENT WITH EURO DISNEY ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS.

REMAINING LEASE RENTALS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 OF

APPROXIMATELY $544 MILLION RECEIVABLE FROM EURO DISNEY

UNDER THE SUBLEASE APPROXIMATE THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY DISNEY SNC

UNDER THE LEASE. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SUBLEASE TERM, EURO

DISNEY WILL HAVE THE OPTION OF ASSUMING DISNEY SNCS RIGHTS

AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LEASE FOR A PAYMENT OF $90 MILLION

OVER THE ENSUING 15 MONTHS. IF EURO DISNEY DOES NOT

EXERCISE ITS OPTION, DISNEY SNC MAY PURCHASE THE ASSETS,

CONTINUE TO LEASE THE ASSETS OR ELECT TO TERMINATE THE LEASE. IN

THE EVENT THE LEASE IS TERMINATED, DISNEY SNC WOULD BE OBLIGATED

TO MAKE A TERMINATION PAYMENT TO THE LESSOR EQUAL TO 75% OF THE

LESSORS THEN OUTSTANDING DEBT RELATED TO THE DISNEYLAND

PARK ASSETS, WHICH PAYMENT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY

$1.3 BILLION. DISNEY SNC WOULD THEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO SELL

OR LEASE THE ASSETS ON BEHALF OF THE LESSOR TO SATISFY THE

REMAINING DEBT, WITH ANY EXCESS PROCEEDS PAYABLE TO DISNEY SNC.

NOTWITHSTANDING EURO DISNEYS FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS UNLIKELY THAT DISNEY SNC WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO PAY THE 75% LEASE TERMINATION PAYMENT AS THE COMPANY

CURRENTLY EXPECTS THAT IN ORDER FOR EURO DISNEY TO CONTINUE ITS

BUSINESS IT WILL EITHER EXERCISE ITS ASSUMPTION OPTION IN 2006

OR THAT THE ASSUMPTION OF THE LEASE BY EURO DISNEY WILL

OTHERWISE BE PROVIDED FOR IN THE RESOLUTION TO EURO

DISNEYS FINANCIAL SITUATION.

INSURANCE

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAVE OCCURRED DURING 2002 AND

2001 IN THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MARKET WHICH IMPACTED THE COST

AND AVAILABILITY OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE COVERAGE. WE

HAVE SUCCESSFULLY RENEWED ALL OF OUR POLICIES IN THE CURRENT

FISCAL YEAR, WITH PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES AT LEVELS CONSISTENT

WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. IN 2002, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A WHOLLY

OWNED CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANY TO INSURE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF

LOSS EXPOSURE WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY INSURED BY THIRD-PARTY

INSURANCE COMPANIES. THE COMPANYS RISK OF LOSS CREATED BY

THE CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANY HAS BEEN REDUCED DURING 2003 BY

THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO ECONOMICALLY TRANSFER SOME OF THIS

ADDITIONAL RISK TO THIRD-PARTY INSURERS.

AIRCRAFT

LEASES

AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, BASED ON UNITED AIRLINES BANKRUPTCY

FILING, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS UNLIKELY THAT IT WILL RECOVER

ITS AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT WITH UNITED AIRLINES.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE CURRENT YEAR, THE COMPANY

WROTE-OFF ITS INVESTMENT IN LEVERAGED LEASES WITH UNITED

AIRLINES AND THE PRE-TAX CHARGE OF $114 MILLION FOR THE

WRITE-OFF IS REPORTED IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2003, THE COMPANYS REMAINING NET AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASE

INVESTMENT TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $175 MILLION, CONSISTING OF

$119 MILLION AND $56 MILLION WITH DELTA AIR LINES AND

FEDEX, RESPECTIVELY. GIVEN THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE AIRLINE

INDUSTRY, WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE

INVESTMENTS, PARTICULARLY DELTA AIR LINES. THE INABILITY OF

DELTA AIR LINES TO MAKE THEIR LEASE PAYMENTS, OR THE TERMINATION

OF OUR LEASES IN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING, COULD RESULT IN A

MATERIAL CHARGE FOR THE WRITE-DOWN OF SOME OR ALL OUR INVESTMENT

AND ACCELERATION OF INCOME TAX PAYMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LEGAL

AND TAX MATTERS

AS DISCLOSED IN NOTES 8 AND 14 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR

CERTAIN LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS

CURRENTLY NOT POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE

ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE ON THE

COMPANYS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL

POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT. FOR A SUMMARY

OF ALL OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING

POLICIES DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE NOTE 2 OF THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND

COSTS

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF FILM AND TELEVISION

PRODUCTION AND PARTICIPATIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN MULTI-YEAR

SPORTS RIGHTS OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON

THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO THE

ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS REVENUES OR STRAIGHT-LINE, AS

APPROPRIATE. THESE ESTIMATES ARE CALCULATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL

PRODUCTION BASIS FOR FILM AND TELEVISION AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL

CONTRACT BASIS FOR SPORTS RIGHTS. ESTIMATES OF TOTAL GROSS

REVENUES CAN CHANGE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE

LEVEL OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, ADVERTISING RATES AND SUBSCRIBER

FEES.

FOR FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS, ESTIMATED

REMAINING GROSS REVENUE FROM ALL SOURCES INCLUDES REVENUE THAT

WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DATE OF THE INITIAL

THEATRICAL RELEASE FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS. FOR TELEVISION SERIES,

WE INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN 10 YEARS OF

THE DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION,

FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE.

FOR ACQUIRED FILM LIBRARIES, REMAINING REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS

TO BE EARNED FOR UP TO 20 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION.

TELEVISION NETWORK AND STATION RIGHTS FOR

THEATRICAL MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS ARE CHARGED TO

EXPENSE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO

BE SHOWN. ESTIMATES OF USAGE OF TELEVISION NETWORK AND STATION

PROGRAMMING CAN CHANGE BASED ON COMPETITION AND AUDIENCE

ACCEPTANCE. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE ESTIMATES AND PLANNED USAGE ARE

REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND ARE REVISED IF NECESSARY. A CHANGE IN

REVENUE PROJECTIONS OR PLANNED USAGE COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND

PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR OUR TELEVISION AND CABLE NETWORKS ARE

SUBJECT TO VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS PURSUANT TO THE APPLICABLE

ACCOUNTING RULES. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE TELEVISION

BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A

DAYPART METHODOLOGY. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE: EARLY

MORNING, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIME TIME, NEWS, CHILDREN AND

SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN

AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF

DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF

OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR

EACH CABLE CHANNEL. ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS

ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL DEMAND OR

MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR PROJECTIONS, FILM,

TELEVISION AND PROGRAMMING COST WRITE-DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR

ITS VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE

CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH BUSINESS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THESE REVENUE RECOGNITION

POLICIES.

WE RECORD REDUCTIONS TO REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED

FUTURE RETURNS OF MERCHANDISE, PRIMARILY HOME VIDEO, DVD AND

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, AND FOR CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND SALES

INCENTIVES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL RETURN

EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS OF CUSTOMER

-46-

DEMAND FOR AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS.

DIFFERENCES MAY RESULT IN THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF OUR REVENUE

FOR ANY PERIOD IF ACTUAL PERFORMANCE VARIES FROM OUR ESTIMATES.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

THE COMPANYS PENSION BENEFIT AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE

CALCULATED USING ACTUARIAL CONCEPTS, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 87

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS

(SFAS 87) AND

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 106,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OTHER

THAN PENSION

(SFAS 106), RESPECTIVELY. TWO CRITICAL

ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY

MEASUREMENT. WE EVALUATE THESE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ANNUALLY.

OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INVOLVE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS

RETIREMENT, MORTALITY, TURNOVER AND RATE OF COMPENSATION

INCREASES.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED

FUTURE CASH FLOW AS A PRESENT VALUE ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE

GUIDELINE FOR SETTING THIS RATE IS A HIGH-QUALITY LONG-TERM

CORPORATE BOND RATE. A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE INCREASES THE PRESENT

VALUE OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES PENSION EXPENSE. WE

REDUCED OUR DISCOUNT RATE TO 5.85% IN 2003 FROM 7.20% IN 2002 TO

REFLECT MARKET INTEREST RATE CONDITIONS. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT

DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE ANNUAL

EXPENSE AND THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $28 MILLION

AND $650 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT

INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE ANNUAL

EXPENSE AND PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS BY $26 MILLION

AND $541 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED

ASSET ALLOCATION, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON

EACH PLAN ASSET CLASS. A LOWER EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON

PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE. OUR LONG-TERM

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.50% AND 8.50% IN 2003 AND

2002, RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE/DECREASE IN

THE LONG-TERM RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSET ASSUMPTION WOULD

DECREASE/INCREASE ANNUAL PENSION EXPENSE BY $31 MILLION.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-LIVED ASSETS

AND INVESTMENTS

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2001, WE ADOPTED

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(SFAS 142), AS

DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS MUST

BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. WE COMPLETED OUR

IMPAIRMENT TESTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 AND DETERMINED

THAT THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RELATED TO GOODWILL AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. IN ASSESSING THE RECOVERABILITY OF

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MARKET VALUES AND

PROJECTIONS REGARDING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND OTHER

FACTORS ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE

ASSETS. IF THESE ESTIMATES OR RELATED PROJECTIONS CHANGE IN THE

FUTURE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR

THESE ASSETS.

FOR PURPOSES OF PERFORMING THE IMPAIRMENT TEST

FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AS REQUIRED BY

SFAS 142 WE ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING REPORTING UNITS.

CABLE NETWORKS, TELEVISION BROADCASTING, RADIO, STUDIO

ENTERTAINMENT, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND PARKS AND RESORTS.

FOR PURPOSES OF PERFORMING OUR IMPAIRMENT TEST,

WE USED A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) TO

DETERMINE FAIR VALUE FOR ALL OF THE REPORTING UNITS EXCEPT FOR

THE TELEVISION BROADCASTING GROUP. THE TELEVISION BROADCASTING

REPORTING UNIT INCLUDES THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND OWNED AND

OPERATED TELEVISION STATIONS. THESE BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN GROUPED

TOGETHER BECAUSE THEIR RESPECTIVE CASH FLOWS ARE DEPENDENT ON

ONE ANOTHER. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR IMPAIRMENT TEST, WE USED A

PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE TO VALUE THE OWNED AND OPERATED

TELEVISION STATIONS AND A REVENUE MULTIPLE TO VALUE THE

TELEVISION NETWORK. WE DID NOT USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE OR

A MARKET MULTIPLE APPROACH TO VALUE THE TELEVISION NETWORK AS A

PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE WOULD NOT CAPTURE THE FULL FAIR VALUE OF

THE TELEVISION NETWORK AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO RECENT COMPARABLE

SALE TRANSACTIONS FOR A TELEVISION NETWORK. WE APPLIED WHAT WE

BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES

-47-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS. IF WE HAD

ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDE CERTAIN LONG-TERM

INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IS

DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES, AS WELL

AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE

INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT FOR THESE

INVESTMENTS, WE CONSIDER THESE FACTORS AS WELL AS FORECASTED

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTEES. IF THESE FORECASTS ARE

NOT MET, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.

CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED OUR ESTIMATE OF THE

PROBABLE COSTS FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS. THIS ESTIMATE

HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND IS

BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A

COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. IT IS

POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY

PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY

AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE PROCEEDINGS. SEE NOTE 14 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION

ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.

INCOME TAX AUDITS

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY

AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME

TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. THE

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) HAS COMPLETED ITS

EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANYS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR

1993 THROUGH 1995 AND HAS PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS THAT CHALLENGE

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS TAX POSITIONS. THE COMPANY HAS

NEGOTIATED THE SETTLEMENT OF A NUMBER OF THESE ASSESSMENTS, AND

IS PURSUING AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL BEFORE THE IRS WITH REGARD

TO THE REMAINDER. IF THE REMAINING PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS ARE

UPHELD THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PROCESS, THEY COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS EARNINGS AND CASH

FLOW. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS TAX POSITIONS

COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE TAX LAW AND INTENDS TO DEFEND ITS

POSITIONS VIGOROUSLY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS ADEQUATELY

PROVIDED FOR ANY REASONABLY FORESEEABLE OUTCOME RELATED TO THESE

MATTERS. ACCORDINGLY, ALTHOUGH THEIR ULTIMATE RESOLUTION MAY

REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CASH TAX PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT

ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL EARNINGS IMPACT FROM THESE MATTERS.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY FAVORABLY

RESOLVED CERTAIN STATE INCOME TAX AUDIT ISSUES AND THE

CORRESPONDING REDUCTION IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE WAS DUE TO THE

RELEASE OF RELATED INCOME TAX RESERVES AND IS REFLECTED IN THE

CURRENT YEAR INCOME TAX PROVISION. SEE NOTE 8 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

SFAS 150

IN MAY 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS NO. 150 (SFAS 150),

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES

AND EQUITY

. SFAS 150, ESTABLISHES STANDARDS FOR HOW AN

ISSUER CLASSIFIES AND MEASURES CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY. THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 150 IN THE FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003 DID

NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATION OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

SFAS 149

IN APRIL 2003, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 149 (SFAS 149),

AMENDMENT OF STATEMENT 133 ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND

HEDGING ACTIVITIES

. SFAS 149 AMENDS AND CLARIFIES FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND FOR

HEDGING ACTIVITIES UNDER STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

(SFAS 133). THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 149

IN THE FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATION OR FINANCIAL

POSITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EITF 00-21

THE COMPANY ADOPTED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE

(EITF) NO. 00-21,

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH

MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES

(EITF 00-21) IN THE FISCAL FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2003. THIS NEW ACCOUNTING RULE ADDRESSES REVENUE

RECOGNITION FOR REVENUES DERIVED FROM A SINGLE CONTRACT THAT

CONTAINS MULTIPLE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. THE RULE PROVIDES

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO DETERMINE WHEN SUCH REVENUES MAY BE

RECORDED SEPARATELY FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. HISTORICALLY, THE

COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED THE NFL BROADCAST PORTION OF ESPNS

AFFILIATE REVENUE WHEN THE NFL GAMES WERE AIRED, AS ESPNS

AFFILIATE CONTRACTS PROVIDED A BASIS FOR ALLOCATING SUCH REVENUE

BETWEEN NFL AND NON-NFL PROGRAMMING. SINCE THE COST OF THE NFL

RIGHTS HAS ALSO BEEN RECOGNIZED AS THE GAMES WERE AIRED, THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZED BOTH THE NFL REVENUES AND NFL COSTS IN THE

QUARTERS THE GAMES WERE AIRED.

UNDER EITF 00-21S REQUIREMENTS FOR

SEPARATING THE REVENUE ELEMENTS OF A SINGLE CONTRACT, THE

COMPANY WILL NO LONGER ALLOCATE ESPNS AFFILIATE REVENUE

BETWEEN NFL AND NON-NFL PROGRAMMING FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. AS

A CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY WILL NO LONGER MATCH ALL NFL REVENUE

WITH NFL COSTS AS ESPN AFFILIATE REVENUE (INCLUDING THE NFL

PORTION) WILL BE RECOGNIZED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, WHILE

NFL CONTRACT COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE

QUARTERS THE GAMES ARE AIRED. THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE IMPACTS

ONLY THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION AND HAS NO IMPACT ON CASH

FLOW. AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE, THE MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT

WILL REPORT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY IN

THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER WHEN THE MAJORITY OF THE NFL GAMES ARE

AIRED, WITH COMMENSURATELY INCREASED REVENUES AND PROFITS IN THE

SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS.

THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO ADOPT THIS NEW

ACCOUNTING RULE USING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT APPROACH. IN THE

FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX

CHARGE OF $71 MILLION FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE

IN ACCOUNTING AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2003. THIS

AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE REVENUE RECORDED FOR NFL GAMES IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2002, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN

RECORDED RATABLY OVER FISCAL 2003 UNDER THE NEW ACCOUNTING

METHOD. THE IMPACT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER REFLECTS THE

RECOGNITION OF THE REMAINING $34 MILLION OF THE

$71 MILLION CUMULATIVE EFFECT, OFFSET BY THE

$36 MILLION IMPACT OF NOT RECOGNIZING NFL REVENUE THAT,

UNDER THE PRE-EITF 00-21 METHOD, THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE RECORDED

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003 AS THE GAMES WERE AIRED.

THIS AMOUNT WILL BE RECOGNIZED DURING FISCAL YEAR 2004. THE

FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE QUARTERLY EFFECT ON FISCAL YEAR 2003

OF THIS NEW ACCOUNTING METHOD.

FIN 46

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED FASB

INTERPRETATION NO. 46,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES

(FIN 46) AND AMENDED IT IN OCTOBER 2003,

SUCH THAT IT IS NOW EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY IN THE FIRST

FISCAL QUARTER OF 2004. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) ARE

ENTITIES THAT LACK SUFFICIENT EQUITY TO FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES

WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER PARTIES OR WHOSE

EQUITY HOLDERS LACK ADEQUATE DECISION MAKING ABILITY BASED ON

CRITERIA SET FORTH IN THE INTERPRETATION. ALL VIES, WITH

-49-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED, MUST BE EVALUATED

TO DETERMINE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF

THE VIE. THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE

VIE FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY HAS EQUITY INTERESTS IN CERTAIN

ENTITIES, INCLUDING EURO DISNEY S.C.A. (EURO DISNEY) AND

HONGKONG INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS LIMITED (HONG KONG

DISNEYLAND), WHICH ARE CURRENTLY NOT CONSOLIDATED, BUT UNDER

CURRENT RULES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY OR COST METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING. THE CURRENT FIN 46 GUIDANCE IS STILL EVOLVING

WITH SEVERAL PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS RECENTLY

ISSUED THROUGH AN EXPOSURE DRAFT RELEASE. WHILE WE CONTINUE TO

EVALUATE THE TOTAL IMPACT OF FIN 46, BASED ON THE CURRENT

EXPOSURE DRAFT, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL LIKELY BE

REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. SEE NOTE 4 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE IMPACT OF

CONSOLIDATING EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND. THE COMPANY

ALSO HAS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN CERTAIN OTHER ENTITIES,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS FOR FILM

RIGHTS AND CERTAIN CAPITAL ASSETS. THESE ENTITIES MAY BE

CONSIDERED VIES UNDER FIN 46 AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO

CONSOLIDATE CERTAIN OF THEM.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT RECOGNITION OF ANY

ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF CONSOLIDATING ANY VIES

WOULD NOT INCREASE THE LEVEL OF CLAIMS ON THE GENERAL ASSETS OF

THE COMPANY; RATHER, THEY WOULD REPRESENT CLAIMS AGAINST THE

ADDITIONAL ASSETS RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF

CONSOLIDATING THE VIES. CONVERSELY, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY

ADDITIONAL ASSETS RECOGNIZED AS A RESULT OF CONSOLIDATING ANY

VIES WOULD NOT REPRESENT ADDITIONAL ASSETS OF THE COMPANY THAT

COULD BE USED TO SATISFY CLAIMS BY THE CREDITORS OF THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION, THE POTENTIAL CONSOLIDATION OF VIES IN WHICH THE

COMPANY IS NOT THE MAJORITY EQUITY HOLDER WILL GENERALLY RESULT

IN AN INCREASE IN THE MINORITY INTEREST IN OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

FIN 45

IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE FASB ISSUED FASB

INTERPRETATION NO. 45,

GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING AND

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT

GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS

(FIN 45). FIN 45

REQUIRES A GUARANTOR TO RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY, AT THE INCEPTION

OF THE GUARANTEE, FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF OBLIGATIONS IT HAS

UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING THE GUARANTEE AND ALSO REQUIRES MORE

DETAILED DISCLOSURES WITH RESPECT TO GUARANTEES. FIN 45 IS

EFFECTIVE FOR GUARANTEES ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER

DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR

EXISTING GUARANTEES. THE ADOPTION OF FIN 45 DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURE WITH RESPECT TO GUARANTEES IN NOTE 14 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT

MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST

RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE

MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY

ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THE COMPANYS

EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND

THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY

SECURITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST

RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY

ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER OVERALL BORROWING COSTS.

TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE

SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO

THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET

DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW

VOLATILITY IN ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE

BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS

INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN

CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED FOREIGN

CURRENCY REVENUES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTION STRATEGIES AND

FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE SALE OF FOREIGN

CURRENCIES TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED,

REVENUES. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE

FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE PRINCIPAL FOREIGN

CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN AND

CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY

CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLAR

DENOMINATED BORROWING. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE

COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES OF ITS

FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES GENERALLY FOR PERIODS NOT

TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS

OFFSET CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES.

IN ADDITION, WE USE VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

TO MINIMIZE THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FAIR MARKET VALUE OF

CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES.

IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ENTER INTO

FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED

NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

VALUE AT RISK

WE UTILIZE A VALUE-AT-RISK

(VAR) MODEL TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND

QUALIFYING EQUITY SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL

ESTIMATES ARE MADE ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95%

CONFIDENCE LEVEL. VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED IN A

VAR COMPUTATION. THE COMPANYS COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON

THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS INTEREST

RATES, CURRENCIES AND EQUITY PRICES (A

VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE

INTERRELATIONSHIPS WERE DETERMINED BY OBSERVING INTEREST RATE,

FOREIGN CURRENCY AND EQUITY MARKET CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING

QUARTER FOR THE CALCULATION OF VAR AMOUNTS AT YEAR-END AND OVER

EACH OF THE FOUR QUARTERS FOR THE CALCULATION OF AVERAGE VAR

AMOUNTS DURING THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. THE MODEL

INCLUDES ALL OF THE COMPANYS DEBT AS WELL AS ALL INTEREST

RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND QUALIFYING

-53-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE VALUES OF FOREIGN

EXCHANGE OPTIONS DO NOT CHANGE ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS WITH THE

UNDERLYING CURRENCIES, AS EXCHANGE RATES VARY. THEREFORE, THE

HEDGE COVERAGE ASSUMED TO BE OBTAINED FROM EACH OPTION HAS BEEN

ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ITS RESPECTIVE SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY VALUES. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM

COMMITMENTS AND RECEIVABLES AND PAYABLES DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES, WHICH CERTAIN OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO

HEDGE, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES

NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WILL

BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL

EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS. SEE NOTE 13 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REGARDING THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003

AND 2002.

VAR ON A COMBINED BASIS INCREASED FROM

$33 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 TO $51 MILLION

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. THE MAJORITY OF THIS INCREASE WAS IN

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS, DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE

COMPANY HAS TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF THE CURRENT LOW INTEREST RATE

ENVIRONMENT BY REPLACING VARIABLE RATE DEBT WITH FIXED-RATE DEBT

OBLIGATIONS. THE MARKET VALUE OF FIXED-RATE DEBT IS MORE

SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES THAN FLOATING-RATE DEBT

AND ACCORDINGLY, IS DRIVING THE INCREASE IN THE VAR.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN

FAIR VALUE, CALCULATED USING THE VAR MODEL, IS AS FOLLOWS.

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND

PROCEDURES TO ENSURE THAT MATERIAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE

COMPANY, INCLUDING ITS CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES, IS MADE KNOWN

TO THE OFFICERS WHO CERTIFY THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL REPORTS

AND TO OTHER MEMBERS OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS.

BASED ON THEIR EVALUATION AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THE PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND

PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY HAVE

CONCLUDED THAT THE WALT DISNEY COMPANYS DISCLOSURE

CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES (AS DEFINED IN RULES 13A-14[C] AND

15D-14[C] UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934) ARE

EFFECTIVE TO ENSURE THAT THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO BE

DISCLOSED BY THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY IN REPORTS THAT IT FILES OR

SUBMITS UNDER THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE ACT OF 1934 IS RECORDED,

PROCESSED, SUMMARIZED AND REPORTED WITHIN THE TIME PERIODS

SPECIFIED IN SEC RULES AND FORMS.

IN FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANY INITIATED A

COMPANY-WIDE IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW INTEGRATED FINANCE AND HUMAN

RESOURCES APPLICATIONS SOFTWARE, RELATED INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

SYSTEMS, AND ENTERPRISE WIDE SHARED SERVICES (THE NEW SYSTEMS).

A LIMITED NUMBER OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES WERE USING

THESE NEW SYSTEMS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002. DURING FISCAL 2003, THE

COMPANY CONTINUED ITS IMPLEMENTATION AND AT SEPTEMBER 30,

2003, A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS UNITS

WERE USING THE NEW SYSTEMS. AS A RESULT OF SUBSEQUENT

IMPLEMENTATIONS, AS OF THE DATE OF THIS REPORT, THE MAJORITY OF

THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES ARE USING THE NEW SYSTEMS. THE

IMPLEMENTATION HAS INVOLVED CHANGES IN SYSTEMS THAT INCLUDED

INTERNAL CONTROLS, AND ACCORDINGLY, THESE CHANGES HAVE REQUIRED

CHANGES TO OUR SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROLS. WE HAVE REVIEWED

EACH SYSTEM AS IT IS BEING IMPLEMENTED AND THE CONTROLS AFFECTED

BY THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE NEW SYSTEMS, AND MADE APPROPRIATE

CHANGES TO AFFECTED INTERNAL CONTROLS AS WE IMPLEMENTED THE NEW

SYSTEMS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CONTROLS AS MODIFIED ARE

APPROPRIATE AND FUNCTIONING EFFECTIVELY.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

COMPANY INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES AFTER ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND

TRANSACTIONS. IN DECEMBER 1999, DVD FINANCING, INC. (DFI),

A SUBSIDIARY OF DISNEY VACATION DEVELOPMENT, INC. AND AN

INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, COMPLETED A RECEIVABLE SALE

TRANSACTION. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SALE, DFI PREPARES SEPARATE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH ITS SEPARATE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE ALSO CONSOLIDATED IN THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

SFAS 150

IN MAY 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 150 (SFAS 150),

ACCOUNTING FOR

CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH

LIABILITIES AND EQUITY

. SFAS 150, ESTABLISHES STANDARDS FOR

HOW AN ISSUER CLASSIFIES AND MEASURES CERTAIN FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS WITH CHARACTERISTICS OF BOTH LIABILITIES AND EQUITY.

THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 150 IN THE FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003

DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATION OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

SFAS 149

IN APRIL 2003, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 149 (SFAS 149),

AMENDMENT OF STATEMENT 133 ON DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND

HEDGING ACTIVITIES

. SFAS 149 AMENDS AND CLARIFIES

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

AND FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES UNDER

-71-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND

HEDGING ACTIVITIES

(SFAS 133). THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS 149 IN THE FISCAL FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003 DID NOT HAVE

A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATION OR

FINANCIAL POSITION.

EITF 00-21

THE COMPANY ADOPTED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE

(EITF) NO. 00-21,

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH

MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES

(EITF 00-21) IN THE FISCAL FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2003. THIS NEW ACCOUNTING RULE ADDRESSES REVENUE

RECOGNITION FOR REVENUES DERIVED FROM A SINGLE CONTRACT THAT

CONTAINS MULTIPLE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. THE RULE PROVIDES

ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS TO DETERMINE WHEN SUCH REVENUES MAY BE

RECORDED SEPARATELY FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. HISTORICALLY, THE

COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED THE NFL BROADCAST PORTION OF ESPNS

AFFILIATE REVENUE WHEN THE NFL GAMES WERE AIRED, AS ESPNS

AFFILIATE CONTRACTS PROVIDED A BASIS FOR ALLOCATING SUCH REVENUE

BETWEEN NFL AND NON-NFL PROGRAMMING. SINCE THE COST OF THE NFL

RIGHTS HAS ALSO BEEN RECOGNIZED AS THE GAMES WERE AIRED, THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZED BOTH THE NFL REVENUES AND NFL COSTS IN THE

QUARTERS THE GAMES WERE AIRED.

UNDER EITF 00-21S REQUIREMENTS FOR

SEPARATING THE REVENUE ELEMENTS OF A SINGLE CONTRACT, THE

COMPANY WILL NO LONGER ALLOCATE ESPNS AFFILIATE REVENUE

BETWEEN NFL AND NON-NFL PROGRAMMING FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. AS

A CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY WILL NO LONGER MATCH ALL NFL REVENUE

WITH NFL COSTS AS ESPN AFFILIATE REVENUE (INCLUDING THE NFL

PORTION) WILL BE RECOGNIZED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, WHILE

NFL CONTRACT COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE

QUARTERS THE GAMES ARE AIRED. THIS ACCOUNTING CHANGE IMPACTS

ONLY THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION AND HAS NO IMPACT ON CASH

FLOW. AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE, THE MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT

WILL REPORT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY IN

THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER WHEN THE MAJORITY OF THE NFL GAMES ARE

AIRED, WITH COMMENSURATELY INCREASED REVENUES AND PROFITS IN THE

SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS.

THE COMPANY ELECTED TO ADOPT THIS NEW ACCOUNTING

RULE USING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT APPROACH. IN THE FISCAL FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF

$71 MILLION FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN

ACCOUNTING AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2003. THIS AMOUNT

REPRESENTS THE REVENUE RECORDED FOR NFL GAMES IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2002, WHICH WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED

RATABLY OVER FISCAL 2003 UNDER THE NEW ACCOUNTING METHOD. THE

IMPACT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER REFLECTS THE RECOGNITION OF THE

REMAINING $34 MILLION OF THE $71 MILLION CUMULATIVE

EFFECT, OFFSET BY THE $36 MILLION IMPACT OF NOT RECOGNIZING NFL

REVENUE THAT, UNDER THE PRE-EITF 00-21 METHOD, THE COMPANY WOULD

HAVE RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003 AS THE GAMES

WERE

-72-

AIRED. THIS AMOUNT WILL BE RECOGNIZED DURING

FIN 46

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED FASB

INTERPRETATION NO. 46,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES

(FIN 46) AND AMENDED IT IN

OCTOBER 2003, SUCH THAT IT IS NOW EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY

IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER OF 2004. VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(VIES) ARE ENTITIES THAT LACK SUFFICIENT EQUITY TO FINANCE THEIR

ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER

PARTIES OR WHOSE EQUITY HOLDERS LACK ADEQUATE DECISION MAKING

ABILITY BASED ON CRITERIA SET FORTH IN THE INTERPRETATION. ALL

VIES, WITH WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED, MUST BE EVALUATED TO

DETERMINE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF

THE VIE. THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE

VIE FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY HAS EQUITY INTERESTS IN CERTAIN

ENTITIES, INCLUDING EURO DISNEY S.C.A. (EURO DISNEY) AND

HONGKONG INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS LIMITED (HONG KONG

DISNEYLAND), WHICH ARE CURRENTLY NOT CONSOLIDATED, BUT UNDER

CURRENT RULES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY OR COST METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING. THE CURRENT FIN 46 GUIDANCE IS STILL

EVOLVING WITH SEVERAL PROPOSED AMENDMENTS AND CLARIFICATIONS

RECENTLY ISSUED THROUGH AN EXPOSURE DRAFT RELEASE. WHILE WE

CONTINUE TO EVALUATE THE TOTAL IMPACT OF FIN 46, BASED ON

THE CURRENT EXPOSURE DRAFT, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL

LIKELY BE REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG

DISNEYLAND IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. SEE NOTE 4 FOR

THE IMPACT OF CONSOLIDATING EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG

DISNEYLAND. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN CERTAIN

OTHER ENTITIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, FINANCING

ARRANGEMENTS FOR FILM RIGHTS AND CERTAIN CAPITAL ASSETS. THESE

ENTITIES MAY BE CONSIDERED VIES UNDER FIN 46 AND WE MAY BE

REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE CERTAIN OF THEM.

-73-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT RECOGNITION OF ANY

ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES AS A RESULT OF CONSOLIDATING ANY VIES

WOULD NOT INCREASE THE LEVEL OF CLAIMS ON THE GENERAL ASSETS OF

THE COMPANY; RATHER, THEY WOULD REPRESENT CLAIMS AGAINST THE

ADDITIONAL ASSETS RECOGNIZED BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF

CONSOLIDATING THE VIES. CONVERSELY, WE BELIEVE THAT ANY

ADDITIONAL ASSETS RECOGNIZED AS A RESULT OF CONSOLIDATING ANY

VIES WOULD NOT REPRESENT ADDITIONAL ASSETS OF THE COMPANY THAT

COULD BE USED TO SATISFY CLAIMS BY THE CREDITORS OF THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION, THE POTENTIAL CONSOLIDATION OF VIES IN WHICH THE

COMPANY IS NOT THE MAJORITY EQUITY HOLDER WILL GENERALLY RESULT

IN AN INCREASE IN THE MINORITY INTEREST IN OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

FIN 45

IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE FASB ISSUED FASB

INTERPRETATION NO. 45,

GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING AND

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT

GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS

(FIN 45).

FIN 45 REQUIRES A GUARANTOR TO RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY, AT

THE INCEPTION OF THE GUARANTEE, FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF

OBLIGATIONS IT HAS UNDERTAKEN IN ISSUING THE GUARANTEE AND ALSO

REQUIRES MORE DETAILED DISCLOSURES WITH RESPECT TO GUARANTEES.

FIN 45 IS EFFECTIVE FOR GUARANTEES ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER

DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR

EXISTING GUARANTEES. THE ADOPTION OF FIN 45 DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURE WITH RESPECT TO GUARANTEES IN NOTE 14.

SFAS 146

THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 146,

ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

(SFAS 146)

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2002, WHICH DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

POSITION. SFAS 146 REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR A COST

ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITY BE RECOGNIZED AT

FAIR VALUE WHEN THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED, RATHER THAN WHEN THE

EXIT OR DISPOSAL PLAN WAS COMMITTED TO AS WAS GENERALLY THE CASE

UNDER PREVIOUS RULES.

SFAS 144

THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE

IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

(SFAS 144),

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2001, WHICH DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL POSITION. SFAS 144 ESTABLISHES A SINGLE

ACCOUNTING MODEL FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS, INCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

SFAS 143

THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR OBLIGATIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

(SFAS 143) ON OCTOBER 1, 2002, WHICH DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL POSITION. SFAS 143 ESTABLISHES STANDARDS FOR THE

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION

AND ITS ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT COST.

SFAS 142

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2001, THE COMPANY

ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(SFAS 142). SFAS 142 ADDRESSES THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

AND REPORTING FOR ACQUIRED GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS 142, GOODWILL AND A

SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE

NO LONGER AMORTIZED. PURSUANT TO SFAS 142, GOODWILL AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS MUST BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN

ANNUAL BASIS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003, THE

COMPANY UPDATED ITS IMPAIRMENT REVIEW, WHICH INDICATED THAT

THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT. SEE NOTE 6.

SFAS 141

IN JULY 2001, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 141,

BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS

(SFAS 141), WHICH REQUIRES ALL BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001 BE ACCOUNTED FOR

UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD.

SOP 00-2

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2000, THE COMPANY

ADOPTED TWO NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, AICPA STATEMENT OF

POSITION NO. 00-2,

ACCOUNTING BY PRODUCERS OR

DISTRIBUTORS OF FILMS

(SOP 00-2) AND SFAS 133,

SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS NO. 138 (SFAS 138).

SOP 00-2 ESTABLISHES NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR

PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF FILMS, WHICH RESULTED IN CHANGES

IN REVENUE RECOGNITION AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPLOITATION COSTS,

INCLUDING ADVERTISING AND MARKETING EXPENSES AND DEVELOPMENT AND

OVERHEAD COSTS. AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF SOP 00-2,

THE COMPANY RECORDED A ONE-TIME AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF

$228 MILLION, OR $0.11 PER SHARE, REPRESENTING THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION. THE CHARGE REPRESENTS COSTS

THAT WERE CAPITALIZED AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, THAT WOULD

HAVE BEEN EXPENSED UNDER THE NEW RULES. THE ADOPTION OF

SOP 00-2 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OPERATING

RESULTS.

SFAS 133

SFAS 133 AND SFAS 138 REQUIRE THAT

DERIVATIVES BE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE.

CHANGES IN DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUES THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR

VALUE HEDGES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS OFFSETS TO THE

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF RELATED HEDGED ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND

FIRM COMMITMENTS. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVES THAT

ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE DEFERRED AND RECORDED AS

A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(AOCI) UNTIL THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS OCCUR AND ARE

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF A HEDGING

DERIVATIVES CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE IS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED

IN EARNINGS. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE EXECUTED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT

PURPOSES BUT NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER SFAS 133 AND

SFAS 138 ARE RECORDED AT THEIR MARKET VALUE AND RECOGNIZED

IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS 133 AS OF

OCTOBER 1, 2000, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRANSITION

PROVISIONS, THE COMPANY RECORDED (1) AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF

$50 MILLION, OR $0.02 PER SHARE, IN ITS CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME REPRESENTING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE

ADOPTION, AND (2) AN AFTER-TAX UNREALIZED GAIN OF

$60 MILLION IN AOCI. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 DID NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OPERATING RESULTS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

FOOTNOTES THERETO. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE

ESTIMATES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

BROADCAST ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED

WHEN COMMERCIALS ARE AIRED. REVENUES FROM TELEVISION

SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS PRIMARY

CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE

PROVIDED.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES ARE

RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. REVENUES FROM CORPORATE

SPONSORS AT THE THEME PARKS ARE GENERALLY RECORDED OVER THE

PERIOD OF THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENTS COMMENCING WITH THE OPENING

OF THE RELATED ATTRACTION.

REVENUES FROM THE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION OF

MOTION PICTURES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN MOTION PICTURES ARE

EXHIBITED. REVENUES FROM VIDEO SALES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE DATE

THAT VIDEO UNITS ARE MADE WIDELY AVAILABLE FOR SALE BY

RETAILERS. REVENUES FROM THE LICENSING OF FEATURE FILMS AND

TELEVISION PROGRAM-

MING ARE RECORDED WHEN THE MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE

FOR TELECASTING BY THE LICENSEE AND WHEN CERTAIN OTHER

CONDITIONS ARE MET.

MERCHANDISE LICENSING ADVANCE AND GUARANTEE

PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE UNDERLYING ROYALTIES ARE EARNED.

INTERNET ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED ON

THE BASIS OF IMPRESSION VIEWS IN THE PERIOD THE ADVERTISING IS

DISPLAYED, PROVIDED THAT NO SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS REMAIN AND

COLLECTION OF THE RESULTING RECEIVABLE IS PROBABLE. DIRECT

MARKETING AND INTERNET-BASED MERCHANDISE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED

UPON SHIPMENT TO CUSTOMERS.

ADVERTISING EXPENSE

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ADVERTISING EXPENSE INCURRED FOR THE YEARS ENDED

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, 2002, AND 2001 TOTALED

$2.5 BILLION, $2.3 BILLION AND $2.2 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH ON HAND

AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE

MONTHS OR LESS.

INVESTMENTS

DEBT SECURITIES THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE POSITIVE

INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS

HELD-TO-MATURITY AND REPORTED AT AMORTIZED COST.

DEBT SECURITIES NOT CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER

TRADING OR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, AND ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED

IN EARNINGS OR STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY, RESPECTIVELY. ALL

OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING EITHER THE COST

METHOD OR THE EQUITY METHOD.

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS

TO DETERMINE WHETHER A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW THE COST

BASIS IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. IF THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS

JUDGED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COST BASIS OF THE

SECURITY IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE

WRITE-DOWN IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

TRANSLATION POLICY

THE COMPANY USES THE U.S. DOLLAR PREDOMINATELY AS

ITS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDIO AND LICENSING

OPERATIONS. THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR

EURO DISNEY, HONG KONG DISNEYLAND AND INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS OF

THE DISNEY STORES.

FOR U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY LOCATIONS,

FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REMEASURED INTO U.S.

DOLLARS AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, OTHER ASSETS AND DEFERRED REVENUE, WHICH

ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. REVENUE AND

EXPENSES ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT

DURING EACH PERIOD, EXCEPT FOR THOSE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE

PREVIOUSLY NOTED BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT

HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY

REMEASUREMENT ARE INCLUDED IN NET EARNINGS.

FOR THE LOCAL CURRENCY FUNCTIONAL LOCATIONS,

THEIR RELATED CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE INCLUDED AS

A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INVENTORIES

CARRYING AMOUNTS OF MERCHANDISE, MATERIALS AND

SUPPLIES INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A MOVING

AVERAGE COST BASIS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS INCLUDE CAPITALIZABLE

DIRECT NEGATIVE COSTS, PRODUCTION OVERHEAD, INTEREST AND

DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS

ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR FAIR VALUE. ACQUIRED PROGRAMMING

COSTS FOR THE COMPANYS TELEVISION AND CABLE/SATELLITE

NETWORKS ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED

AMORTIZATION, OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ACQUIRED TELEVISION

BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE RECORDED WHEN THE

LICENSE PERIOD BEGINS AND THE PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE FOR USE.

MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS

ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND PARTICIPATION

COSTS ARE EXPENSED BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT

PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS

REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES ON AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION BASIS.

TELEVISION NETWORK SERIES COSTS AND MULTI-YEAR SPORTS RIGHTS ARE

CHARGED TO EXPENSE BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT

PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS

REVENUES FROM SUCH PROGRAMS OR STRAIGHT-LINE, AS APPROPRIATE.

ESTIMATED REMAINING GROSS REVENUE FROM ALL SOURCES FOR FILM AND

TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS INCLUDES REVENUE THAT WILL BE EARNED

WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE

FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS. FOR TELEVISION NETWORK SERIES, WE INCLUDE

REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN 10 YEARS OF THE

DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE

YEARS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE. FOR

ACQUIRED FILM LIBRARIES, REMAINING REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO

BE EARNED FOR UP TO 20 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.

TELEVISION NETWORK AND STATION RIGHTS FOR THEATRICAL MOVIES AND

OTHER LONG-FORM PROGRAMMING ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE PRIMARILY ON

AN ACCELERATED BASIS RELATED TO THE USAGE OF THE PROGRAMS.

DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN DETERMINED WILL

NOT GO INTO PRODUCTION OR HAVE NOT BEEN SET FOR PRODUCTION

WITHIN THREE YEARS ARE WRITTEN-OFF.

ESTIMATES OF TOTAL GROSS REVENUES CAN CHANGE

SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL

OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTS,

ADVERTISING RATES AND SUBSCRIBER FEES. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE

ESTIMATES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND AMORTIZATION IS

ADJUSTED, IF NECESSARY. SUCH ADJUSTMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE NET

REALIZABLE VALUE OF NETWORK TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM

LICENSES AND RIGHTS IS REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A

DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST

DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE.

THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE EARLY MORNING, DAYTIME, LATE

NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN AND SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK

AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING

ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL.

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS

THE COMPANY EXPENSES COSTS INCURRED IN THE

PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE OF DEVELOPING OR ACQUIRING INTERNAL

USE SOFTWARE, SUCH AS RESEARCH AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES, AS WELL

AS COSTS INCURRED IN THE POST-IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONAL STAGE,

SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING. CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE

DEVELOPMENT COSTS OCCURS ONLY AFTER THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT

STAGE IS COMPLETE, MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZES THE PROJECT, AND IT IS

PROBABLE THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETED AND THE SOFTWARE

WILL BE USED FOR THE FUNCTION INTENDED. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2003, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS TOTALED $240 MILLION. THE

CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER

THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE, WHICH RANGES FROM

3-10 YEARS.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST

FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS,

WHICH ARE EITHER THE OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE REPORTING LEVEL

BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANYS REPORTING UNITS

FOR PURPOSES OF APPLYING THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 142 ARE.

CABLE NETWORKS, TELEVISION BROADCASTING, RADIO, STUDIO

ENTERTAINMENT, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND PARKS AND RESORTS.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT ON AN

ANNUAL BASIS TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN

ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT

THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS

LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE.

IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INTANGIBLE ASSET

EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR

VALUES FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED

BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, MARKET MULTIPLES OR APPRAISED

VALUES AS APPROPRIATE.

FOR PURPOSES OF PERFORMING OUR IMPAIRMENT TEST,

WE USED A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) TO

DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE FOR ALL OF THE REPORTING UNITS EXCEPT

FOR THE TELEVISION BROADCASTING GROUP. THE TELEVISION

BROADCASTING REPORTING UNIT INCLUDES THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK

AND OWNED AND OPERATED TELEVISION STATIONS. THESE BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN GROUPED TOGETHER BECAUSE THEIR RESPECTIVE CASH FLOWS

ARE DEPENDENT ON ONE ANOTHER. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR IMPAIRMENT

TEST, WE USED A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE TO VALUE THE OWNED AND

OPERATED TELEVISION STATIONS AND A REVENUE MULTIPLE TO VALUE THE

TELEVISION NETWORK. WE DID NOT USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE OR

A MARKET MULTIPLE APPROACH TO VALUE THE TELEVISION NETWORK AS A

PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE WOULD NOT CAPTURE THE FULL FAIR VALUE OF

THE TELEVISION NETWORK AND THERE HAVE BEEN NO RECENT COMPARABLE

SALE TRANSACTIONS FOR A TELEVISION NETWORK. WE APPLIED WHAT WE

BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES FOR

EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT

REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES

THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER.

AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AS FOLLOWS.

EXCHANGE RATES AND INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES,

INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS;

FORWARD, OPTION AND SWAPTION CONTRACTS, AND INTEREST

RATE CAPS.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS

BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS

RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR UNDERTAKING

VARIOUS HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DERIVATIVES

INTO WHICH THE COMPANY ENTERS: HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AND

HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE. HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE ARE

ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED ASSET,

LIABILITY, OR A FIRM COMMITMENT. HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE

ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION

(E.G., FORECASTED REVENUE) OR THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS TO

BE PAID RELATED TO A RECOGNIZED LIABILITY (E.G. FLOATING RATE

DEBT).

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES AND ASSIGNS THE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFIC

ASSETS, OR SPECIFIC LIABILITIES. WHEN HEDGED ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES ARE SOLD OR EXTINGUISHED OR THE FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO OCCUR, THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED HEDGING

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OPTION PREMIUMS AND UNREALIZED LOSSES ON FORWARD

CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE

RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS OTHER ASSETS. UNREALIZED GAINS

ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST

RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID UNDER THE AGREEMENTS

ARE INCLUDED IN LIABILITIES. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM

HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT CONSISTENT WITH

THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. THE COMPANY

ACCRUES THE DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY

SWAPS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS AS INTEREST

AND EXCHANGE RATES SHIFT AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER

THE LIVES OF THE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE TERMINATION OF

EFFECTIVE SWAP AGREEMENTS, PRIOR TO THEIR ORIGINAL MATURITY, ARE

DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING

TERM OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS.

CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY AS

THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (SEE NOTES 7 AND 13).

EARNINGS PER SHARE

THE COMPANY PRESENTS BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AMOUNTS. BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY

DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON

SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EPS IS BASED UPON

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT

SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR WHICH IS CALCULATED USING THE

TREASURY STOCK METHOD FOR STOCK OPTIONS AND ASSUMES CONVERSION

OF THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES (SEE

NOTE 7). COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE

COMPUTATION IN PERIODS IN WHICH THEY HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE

EFFECT. STOCK OPTIONS FOR WHICH THE EXERCISE PRICE EXCEEDS THE

AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OVER THE PERIOD HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE

EFFECT ON EPS AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE

CALCULATION.

SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS

ON OCTOBER 24, 2001, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED

FOX FAMILY WORLDWIDE, INC. (FFW) FOR $5.2 BILLION, WHICH

WAS FUNDED WITH $2.9 BILLION OF NEW LONG-TERM BORROWINGS

PLUS THE ASSUMPTION OF $2.3 BILLION OF FFW LONG-TERM DEBT.

UPON THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY CHANGED

FFWS NAME TO ABC FAMILY WORLDWIDE, INC. (ABC FAMILY).

AMONG THE BUSINESSES ACQUIRED WERE THE FOX FAMILY CHANNEL, WHICH

HAS BEEN RENAMED ABC FAMILY CHANNEL, A PROGRAMMING SERVICE THAT

CURRENTLY REACHES APPROXIMATELY 86 MILLION CABLE AND

SATELLITE TELEVISION SUBSCRIBERS THROUGHOUT THE U.S.; A 76%

INTEREST IN FOX KIDS EUROPE, WHICH REACHES MORE THAN

33 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS ACROSS EUROPE; FOX KIDS CHANNELS IN

LATIN AMERICA, AND THE SABAN LIBRARY AND ENTERTAINMENT

PRODUCTION BUSINESSES.

OUR MOTIVATION FOR THE ACQUISITION WAS TO ACQUIRE

A FULLY INTEGRATED CABLE CHANNEL AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT

INTERNATIONAL CABLE PRESENCE AND THEREFORE INCREASE SHAREHOLDER

VALUE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN REACH THIS OBJECTIVE THROUGH THE

USE OF NEW STRATEGIES THAT INCLUDE CROSS PROMOTION WITH OUR

OTHER TELEVISION PROPERTIES, REPURPOSING A PORTION OF THE

PROGRAMMING OF THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, UTILIZING PROGRAMMING

FROM THE DISNEY AND ABC LIBRARIES, DEVELOPING ORIGINAL

PROGRAMMING AND BY REDUCING OPERATING COSTS.

THE ACQUISITION OF ABC FAMILY HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED

FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 141. THE COST OF THE

ACQUISITION WAS ALLOCATED TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES

ASSUMED BASED ON ESTIMATES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES AT

THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED BY INTERNAL

STUDIES AND

-80-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY APPRAISALS. THE GOODWILL

THAT AROSE FROM THE ACQUISITION OF ABC FAMILY REFLECTED THE

VALUE TO DISNEY OF ACQUIRING A FULLY-DISTRIBUTED FAMILY BRANDED

CABLE PROPERTY TO COMPLEMENT ITS EXISTING PROPERTIES THAT ARE

PRIMARILY TARGETED TOWARD CHILDREN (TOON DISNEY, DISNEY CHANNEL)

AND ADULTS (ESPN). THE ACQUISITION OF ABC FAMILY RESULTED IN THE

COMPANY HAVING A BROADER ARRAY OF CABLE OFFERINGS. ALTHOUGH MOST

OF THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO GOODWILL, SOME VALUE WAS

ALLOCATED TO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS WITH CABLE AND SATELLITE

MULTIPLE SYSTEMS OPERATORS (MSOS) BASED ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF THOSE CONTRACTS THAT WERE IN EFFECT AT THE DATE OF THE

ACQUISITION. NO VALUE WAS ALLOCATED TO LAPSED CONTRACTUAL

RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE MSOS AS RENEWAL OF SUCH RELATIONSHIPS

WOULD REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT EFFORT AND SUBSTANTIVE NEGOTIATIONS IN

A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE MARKETPLACE.

PRICE ALLOCATION OF ABC FAMILY.

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS HAVE INCORPORATED ABC FAMILYS ACTIVITY ON A

CONSOLIDATED BASIS FROM OCTOBER 24, 2001, THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION. ON AN UNAUDITED PRO FORMA BASIS, ADJUSTING ONLY FOR

THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE ACQUISITION OF ABC FAMILY AND RELATED

INCREMENTAL BORROWINGS HAD OCCURRED AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL

2001, REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 AND

2001 WERE $25,360 MILLION AND $25,803 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. AS-REPORTED AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA NET

INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR FISCAL 2002 WERE

APPROXIMATELY THE SAME. THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA EARNINGS PER

SHARE IMPACT ON FISCAL 2001 WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.01 DILUTIVE,

ASSUMING THAT THE INCREMENTAL ACQUISITION GOODWILL HAD NOT BEEN

AMORTIZED IN THE PRIOR YEAR PURSUANT TO THE NEW GOODWILL

ACCOUNTING RULES. THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA INFORMATION IS NOT

NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAD THE

ACQUISITION ACTUALLY OCCURRED AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2001,

NOR IS IT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

IN FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY SOLD THE ANAHEIM

ANGELS BASEBALL TEAM, WHICH RESULTED IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF

$16 MILLION. IN FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANY SOLD THE DISNEY

STORE OPERATIONS IN JAPAN GENERATING A PRE-TAX GAIN OF

$34 MILLION AND IN FISCAL 2001, THE COMPANY SOLD INFOSEEK

JAPAN K.K. GENERATING A $22 MILLION PRE-TAX GAIN. THESE

GAINS ARE REPORTED IN THE LINE GAIN ON SALE OF

BUSINESSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

ON MARCH 20, 2001, THE COMPANY CONVERTED ALL

OF ITS OUTSTANDING INTERNET GROUP COMMON STOCK INTO DISNEY

COMMON STOCK, RESULTING IN THE ISSUANCE OF APPROXIMATELY

8.6 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK.

EURO DISNEY

THE COMPANY HAS A 39% INTEREST IN EURO DISNEY

S.C.A., WHICH OPERATES THE DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN AND

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE FROM EURO DISNEY TOTALED

$494 MILLION, INCLUDING $117 MILLION DRAWN UNDER A

LINE OF CREDIT WHICH IS DUE IN JUNE 2004. THE MAXIMUM

AMOUNT AVAILABLE UNDER THE LINE IS 168 MILLION EUROS

($192 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 EXCHANGE RATES).

THE SLOWDOWN IN THE EUROPEAN TRAVEL AND TOURISM

INDUSTRY HAS NEGATIVELY AFFECTED EURO DISNEYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOW. IN RESPONSE TO THIS SITUATION, EURO

DISNEY INITIATED DISCUSSIONS WITH ITS LENDERS AND THE COMPANY TO

OBTAIN WAIVERS OF ITS FISCAL 2003 LOAN COVENANTS AND TO OBTAIN

SUPPLEMENTAL FINANCING TO ADDRESS EURO DISNEYS CASH

REQUIREMENTS.

AS A RESULT OF AN AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO ON

MARCH 28, 2003, THE COMPANY DID NOT CHARGE EURO DISNEY

ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES FOR THE PERIOD FROM

JANUARY 1, 2003 TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. DURING THE LAST

THREE QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANYS ROYALTY AND

MANAGEMENT FEE INCOME FROM EURO DISNEY TOTALED $27 MILLION.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY AGREED TO ALLOW EURO DISNEY TO PAY ITS

ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES ANNUALLY IN ARREARS FOR FISCAL

2004, INSTEAD OF QUARTERLY.

ON NOVEMBER 3, 2003, EURO DISNEY OBTAINED

WAIVERS FROM ITS LENDERS, EFFECTIVE THROUGH MARCH 31, 2004,

WITH RESPECT TO COVENANTS FOR FISCAL 2003. THE AGREEMENT IS

EXPECTED TO GIVE EURO DISNEY, ITS LENDERS AND THE COMPANY TIME

TO FIND A RESOLUTION TO EURO DISNEYS FINANCIAL SITUATION.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE BANK WAIVERS, THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED A

NEW 45 MILLION EUROS ($52 MILLION AT

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 EXCHANGE RATES) SUBORDINATED CREDIT

FACILITY, WHICH CAN BE DRAWN ON THROUGH MARCH 31, 2004 ONLY

AFTER EURO DISNEYS EXISTING LINE OF CREDIT WITH THE

COMPANY IS FULLY DRAWN. REPAYMENT OF ANY AMOUNT DRAWN DOWN ON

THE NEW CREDIT FACILITY IS SUBJECT TO EURO DISNEY MEETING

CERTAIN FINANCIAL THRESHOLDS OR THE PRIOR REPAYMENT OF ALL OF

EURO DISNEYS EXISTING DEBT TO ITS LENDERS.

EURO DISNEY IS CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS

WITH ITS AGENT BANKS AND THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN SUPPLEMENTAL

FINANCING TO ADDRESS ITS CASH REQUIREMENTS. SUCH FINANCING MAY

INCLUDE AN EXTENSION OR CHANGE IN THE TERMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANYS CREDIT LINE OR ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS FROM THE

COMPANY. IF A RESOLUTION TO EURO DISNEYS FUTURE FINANCING

NEEDS IS NOT OBTAINED BY MARCH 31, 2004, THE WAIVERS WOULD

EXPIRE AND EURO DISNEYS LENDERS COULD ACCELERATE THE

MATURITY OF EURO DISNEYS DEBT. SHOULD THAT OCCUR, EURO

DISNEY WOULD BE UNABLE TO MEET ALL OF ITS DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT EURO DISNEY WILL ULTIMATELY OBTAIN THE

REQUISITE LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND ADDITIONAL FINANCING; HOWEVER,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL BE THE CASE. SHOULD

EURO DISNEY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN LOAN MODIFICATIONS AND/OR

ADDITIONAL FINANCING, SOME OR ALL OF THE

-82-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPANYS $494 MILLION EURO DISNEY

INVESTMENT AND RECEIVABLES WOULD LIKELY BECOME IMPAIRED.

ADDITIONALLY, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT FINANCING MODIFICATIONS AND/OR

THE FORM OF THE RESOLUTION COULD RESULT IN A PARTIAL IMPAIRMENT

OF THE COMPANYS EURO DISNEY INVESTMENT AND RECEIVABLES.

IN CONNECTION WITH A FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF

EURO DISNEY IN 1994, EURO DISNEY ASSOCIES S.N.C. (DISNEY SNC), A

WHOLLY OWNED AFFILIATE OF THE COMPANY, ENTERED INTO A LEASE

ARRANGEMENT WITH A FINANCING COMPANY WITH A NONCANCELABLE TERM

OF 12 YEARS RELATED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DISNEYLAND

PARK ASSETS, AND THEN ENTERED INTO A 12-YEAR SUBLEASE AGREEMENT

WITH EURO DISNEY ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS. REMAINING

LEASE RENTALS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 OF APPROXIMATELY

$544 MILLION RECEIVABLE FROM EURO DISNEY UNDER THE SUBLEASE

APPROXIMATE THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY DISNEY SNC UNDER THE LEASE.

AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SUBLEASE TERM, EURO DISNEY WILL HAVE

THE OPTION OF ASSUMING DISNEY SNCS RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS

UNDER THE LEASE FOR A PAYMENT OF $90 MILLION OVER THE

ENSUING 15 MONTHS. IF EURO DISNEY DOES NOT EXERCISE ITS

OPTION, DISNEY SNC MAY PURCHASE THE ASSETS, CONTINUE TO LEASE

THE ASSETS OR ELECT TO TERMINATE THE LEASE. IN THE EVENT THE

LEASE IS TERMINATED, DISNEY SNC WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO MAKE A

TERMINATION PAYMENT TO THE LESSOR EQUAL TO 75% OF THE

LESSORS THEN OUTSTANDING DEBT RELATED TO THE DISNEYLAND

PARK ASSETS, WHICH PAYMENT WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY

$1.3 BILLION. DISNEY SNC WOULD THEN HAVE THE RIGHT TO SELL

OR LEASE THE ASSETS ON BEHALF OF THE LESSOR TO SATISFY THE

REMAINING DEBT, WITH ANY EXCESS PROCEEDS PAYABLE TO DISNEY SNC.

NOTWITHSTANDING EURO DISNEYS FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS UNLIKELY THAT DISNEY SNC WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO PAY THE 75% LEASE TERMINATION PAYMENT AS THE COMPANY

CURRENTLY EXPECTS THAT IN ORDER FOR EURO DISNEY TO CONTINUE ITS

BUSINESS IT WILL EITHER EXERCISE ITS ASSUMPTION OPTION IN 2006

OR THAT THE ASSUMPTION OF THE LEASE BY EURO DISNEY WILL

OTHERWISE BE PROVIDED FOR IN THE RESOLUTION TO EURO

DISNEYS FINANCIAL SITUATION.

UNITED AIRLINES, WHICH FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION,

RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX CHARGE OF $114 MILLION, OR $0.04 PER

SHARE. BASED ON THE BANKRUPTCY FILING, WE BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY

THAT THE COMPANY WILL RECOVER THIS INVESTMENT. THE PRE-TAX

CHARGE OF $114 MILLION FOR THE WRITE-OFF IS REPORTED IN

NET INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF INCOME. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, OUR REMAINING AIRCRAFT

LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT TOTALED APPROXIMATELY

$175 MILLION, CONSISTING OF $119 MILLION AND

$56 MILLION, WITH DELTA AIR LINES AND FEDEX, RESPECTIVELY.

GIVEN THE CURRENT STATUS OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, WE CONTINUE TO

MONITOR THE RECOVERABILITY OF THESE INVESTMENTS, PARTICULARLY

THE DELTA AIR LINES LEASES. THE INABILITY OF DELTA AIR LINES TO

MAKE THEIR LEASE PAYMENTS, OR THE TERMINATION OF OUR LEASE

THROUGH A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING, COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL

CHARGE FOR THE WRITE-DOWN OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR INVESTMENT AND

COULD ACCELERATE INCOME TAX PAYMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANYS LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT

INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN INCOME TAX BENEFITS THAT ARE

PROJECTED TO BE REALIZED IN THE FUTURE UNDER THE CURRENT U.S.

INCOME TAX LAWS. AS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 8, THE

U.S. CONGRESS IS CONSIDERING A CHANGE IN THE APPLICABLE INCOME

TAX LAW. SINCE THE IMPACT OF THIS MATTER UPON THE COMPANY

DEPENDS UPON THE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF ANY TAX LEGISLATION

ULTIMATELY ENACTED BY CONGRESS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT

THE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

COMMERCIAL PAPER

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY MAINTAINS U.S. AND EUROPEAN

COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS WITH A COMBINED PROGRAM SIZE OF

$4.5 BILLION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THE COMPANY

HAD ESTABLISHED BANK FACILITIES TOTALING $4.5 BILLION TO

SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS, WITH HALF OF THE FACILITIES

SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN FEBRUARY 2004 AND THE OTHER HALF IN

MARCH 2005. THE COMPANY PLANS TO RENEW OR EXTEND THESE BANK

FACILITIES PRIOR TO THEIR SCHEDULED EXPIRATION. UNDER THE BANK

FACILITIES, THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION TO BORROW AT LIBOR-BASED

RATES PLUS A SPREAD DEPENDING ON THE COMPANYS SENIOR

UNSECURED DEBT RATING. THE COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES

CONTAIN ONLY ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT, RELATING TO INTEREST

COVERAGE, WHICH THE COMPANY MET ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 BY A

SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD

NOT BORROWED AGAINST THE FACILITIES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS THE

ABILITY TO ISSUE UP TO $350 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT

UNDER THE $2.25 BILLION FACILITY EXPIRING IN 2004, WHICH IF

UTILIZED, REDUCES AVAILABLE BORROWING UNDER THIS FACILITY. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, $163 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT

HAD BEEN ISSUED UNDER THIS FACILITY AND $2.087 BILLION WAS

AVAILABLE FOR BORROWING. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, NO

COMMERCIAL PAPER DEBT WAS OUTSTANDING.

$7.5 BILLION SHELF REGISTRATION

STATEMENT

IN AUGUST 2001, THE COMPANY FILED A U.S.

SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION (SEC) THAT ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ISSUE FROM TIME

TO TIME UP TO $7.5 BILLION OF SECURITIES, INCLUDING DEBT

SECURITIES, PREFERRED STOCK, COMMON STOCK, DEPOSITARY SHARES,

WARRANTS AND PURCHASE CONTRACTS. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003,

$3.049 BILLION OF DEBT HAD BEEN ISSUED UNDER THE

COMPANYS U.S. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM (DESCRIBED BELOW)

AND $2.628 BILLION OF DEBT HAD BEEN

-89-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ISSUED UNDER OTHER U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT

PROGRAMS OF WHICH $708 MILLION HAS BEEN REPAID TO DATE

(ALSO DESCRIBED BELOW). THE REMAINING UNUSED CAPACITY UNDER THE

SHELF REGISTRATION IS $1.823 BILLION. OUR ABILITY TO ISSUE

DEBT IS SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING

OUR BORROWING CAPACITY.

U.S. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM

IN SEPTEMBER 2001, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A

$6.5 BILLION U.S. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM UNDER THE U.S.

SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR THE ISSUANCE OF

VARIOUS TYPES OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FIXED OR FLOATING

RATE NOTES, U.S. DOLLAR OR FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED NOTES,

REDEEMABLE NOTES, GLOBAL NOTES AND DUAL CURRENCY OR OTHER

INDEXED NOTES. IN TOTAL, THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED

$3.049 BILLION UNDER THE CURRENT PROGRAM. THE REMAINING

CAPACITY UNDER THE PROGRAM MAY BE FURTHER REDUCED FROM TIME TO

TIME TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY ISSUES SECURITIES OUTSIDE OF

THE EXISTING U.S. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM BUT UNDER THE CURRENT

SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THE

TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CURRENT AND PRIOR U.S.

MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAMS WAS $8.114 BILLION. THE

MATURITIES OF CURRENT OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS RANGE FROM 1 TO

90 YEARS AND STATED INTEREST RATES RANGE FROM 0.84% TO

7.55%.

OTHER U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE BONDS OR

NOTES SEPARATELY FROM THE U.S. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM, UNDER

SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENTS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME. AT

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THE TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING FROM THESE

OFFERINGS, WHICH INCLUDES GLOBAL BONDS, QUARTERLY INTEREST BONDS

(QUIBS), AND CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES (DESCRIBED BELOW) WAS

$1.920 BILLION. THE MATURITIES OF THESE OUTSTANDING

BORROWINGS RANGE FROM 1 TO 28 YEARS AND THE STATED INTEREST

RATES RANGE FROM 2.1% TO 7.0%.

CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES

IN APRIL 2003, THE COMPANY ISSUED

$1.323 BILLION OF CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES DUE ON

APRIL 15, 2023. THESE CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES ARE

REGISTERED UNDER THE $7.5 BILLION SHELF REGISTRATION

STATEMENT. THE NOTES BEAR INTEREST AT A FIXED ANNUAL RATE OF

2.125% AND ARE REDEEMABLE AT THE COMPANYS OPTION ANY TIME

AFTER APRIL 15, 2008 AT A PRICE OF 100% OF THE PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT OF THE NOTES. THE NOTES ARE REDEEMABLE AT THE

INVESTORS OPTION AT A PRICE OF 100% OF PRINCIPAL AMOUNT ON

APRIL 15, 2008, APRIL 15, 2013 AND APRIL 15,

2018, AND UPON THE OCCURRENCE OF CERTAIN FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES,

SUCH AS A CHANGE IN CONTROL. THE NOTES ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO

COMMON STOCK, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AT AN INITIAL

CONVERSION RATE OF 33.9443 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PER

$1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NOTES. THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO AN

INITIAL CONVERSION PRICE OF $29.46. THE CONVERSION RATE IS

SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT IF CERTAIN EVENTS OCCUR, SUCH AS THE

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS ON THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK

EXCLUSIVELY IN THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK, THE ISSUANCE TO

ALL HOLDERS OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK OF RIGHTS OR

WARRANTS THAT ALLOW THE HOLDERS TO PURCHASE SHARES OF THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK DURING A SPECIFIED PERIOD OF TIME,

AND SUBDIVISION, COMBINATIONS OR CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS OF

THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK.

PRIVATELY PLACED DEBT

IN 1996, THE COMPANY RAISED $850 MILLION OF

PRIVATELY PLACED FINANCING. THE NOTES PAY 7.02% INTEREST PER

ANNUM AND AMORTIZE SEMI-ANNUALLY. THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AS

OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 WAS $343 MILLION.

EUROPEAN MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM

IN JULY 2002, THE COMPANY RENEWED ITS

EUROPEAN MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM FOR THE ISSUANCE OF VARIOUS

TYPES OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FIXED OR FLOATING RATE NOTES,

U.S. DOLLAR OR FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED NOTES, REDEEMABLE

NOTES, INDEX LINKED AND DUAL CURRENCY NOTES. AT SUCH TIME, THE

PROGRAM SIZE WAS INCREASED FROM $3.0 BILLION TO

$4.0 BILLION. IN 2003, NO NEW DEBT WAS ISSUED BY THE

COMPANY UNDER THE PROGRAM. THE REMAINING CAPACITY TO ISSUE UNDER

THE PROGRAM IS $2.481 BILLION, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO MARKET

CONDITIONS AND OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR BORROWING CAPACITY.

THE

-90-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REMAINING CAPACITY UNDER THE PROGRAM REPLENISHES

AS OUTSTANDING DEBT UNDER THE PROGRAM MATURES. AT

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THE TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE

PROGRAM WAS $1.519 BILLION. THE MATURITIES OF CURRENT

OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS RANGE FROM 1 TO 4 YEARS AND STATED

INTEREST RATES RANGE FROM 0.72% TO 6.26%. THE COMPANY HAS

OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS UNDER THE PROGRAM DENOMINATED IN U.S.

DOLLARS, HONG KONG DOLLARS, SINGAPORE DOLLARS AND JAPANESE YEN.

PREFERRED STOCK

AS A RESULT OF THE ABC FAMILY ACQUISITION IN

OCTOBER 2001, THE COMPANY ASSUMED SERIES A PREFERRED

STOCK WITH A 9% COUPON AND QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS VALUED AT

APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION WITH AN EFFECTIVE COST OF

CAPITAL OF 5.25%. THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK IS CALLABLE

STARTING AUGUST 1, 2007, AND MATURES AUGUST 1, 2027.

IN JULY 1999, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY

ISSUED $102 MILLION OF AUCTION MARKET PREFERRED STOCK

(AMPS). THESE ARE PERPETUAL, NON-CUMULATIVE, NON-REDEEMABLE

INSTRUMENTS. QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS, IF DECLARED, ARE AT THE

RATE OF 5.427% PER ANNUM, FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS. AMPS WILL BE

REMARKETED THROUGH AN AUCTION PROCEDURE IN JULY 2004. THE

COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A VALID BID FOR ALL THE AMPS AT

THAT TIME. BASED ON THE COMPANYS CURRENT CREDIT RATING,

THE HOLDERS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REMARKET THE AMPS AT AN

EARLIER DATE. THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM THE

AMPS HOLDERS TO CONDUCT AN EARLIER AUCTION.

THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK AND THE AMPS

ARE CLASSIFIED AS BORROWINGS GIVEN THEIR SUBSTANTIVE SIMILARITY

TO DEBT INSTRUMENTS. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THE TOTAL

BALANCE OUTSTANDING WAS $485 MILLION.

CAPITAL CITIES/ ABC AND ABC FAMILY PUBLICLY

TRADED DEBT

AS A RESULT OF THE ABC FAMILY ACQUISITION IN

OCTOBER 2001, THE COMPANY ASSUMED $475 MILLION OF

9  1/4% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2007, VALUED AT $502 MILLION

AND $560 MILLION OF 10  1/4% SENIOR DISCOUNT NOTES DUE

2007, VALUED AT $589 MILLION (COLLECTIVELY, THE ABC

FAMILY NOTES). AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, THE REMAINING

FAIR VALUE OF THE ABC FAMILY NOTES WAS $892 MILLION, AS THE

COMPANY HAD REPURCHASED $194 MILLION OF THE NOTES PRIOR TO

THE STATED MATURITY DATE. THE ABC FAMILY NOTES WERE REDEEMABLE

BY ABC FAMILY STARTING NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND SEMI-ANNUALLY

THEREAFTER. ABC FAMILY EXERCISED ITS RIGHT TO REDEEM THE NOTES

AND, ACCORDINGLY, ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING ABC FAMILY NOTES WERE

REDEEMED ON NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AT A PRICE OF 104.625% FOR THE

SENIOR NOTES AND 105.125% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT FOR THE SENIOR

DISCOUNT NOTES.

AS A RESULT OF THE CAPITAL CITIES/ ABC, INC.

ACQUISITION IN 1996, THE COMPANY ASSUMED VARIOUS DEBT PREVIOUSLY

ISSUED BY CAPITAL CITIES/ ABC, INC. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003,

THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE WAS $191 MILLION WITH MATURITIES

RANGING FROM 6 TO 18 YEARS AND STATED INTEREST RATES

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003

AND 2002 WERE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATING TO A

PORTION OF THE TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN NET

OPERATING LOSSES (NOLS) REFLECTED ON STATE TAX RETURNS OF

INFOSEEK AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE INFOSEEK

ACQUISITION ON NOVEMBER 18, 1999 WHERE APPLICABLE STATE

LAWS LIMIT THE UTILIZATION OF SUCH NOLS. IN ADDITION, DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 WERE REDUCED BY A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE TAX BENEFITS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN NOLS REFLECTED ON TAX RETURNS OF ABC

FAMILY WORLDWIDE, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO

THE ABC FAMILY ACQUISITION ON OCTOBER 24, 2001 (SEE

NOTE 3). SINCE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES ASSOCIATED WITH

BOTH ACQUISITIONS RELATE TO ACQUIRED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, THE

SUBSEQUENT REALIZATION OF THESE TAX BENEFITS WOULD RESULT IN

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ALLOWANCE AMOUNT BEING APPLIED AS REDUCTIONS

TO GOODWILL.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, APPROXIMATELY

$210 MILLION OF NOL CARRYFORWARDS WERE AVAILABLE TO OFFSET

FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME THROUGH THE YEAR 2022. SINCE THE

ACQUISITION OF ABC FAMILY CONSTITUTED AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE AS

DEFINED UNDER SECTION 382 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, THE

UTILIZATION OF ABC FAMILYS PRE-OWNERSHIP CHANGE NOLS IS

SUBJECT TO AN ANNUAL LIMITATION. HOWEVER, SUCH ANNUAL LIMITATION

WILL NOT IMPAIR THE REALIZATION OF THESE NOLS.

IN 2003, 2002, AND 2001, INCOME TAX BENEFITS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSACTIONS OF

$5 MILLION, $8 MILLION AND $48 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, WERE ALLOCATED TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

IN 2003 THE COMPANY DERIVED TAX BENEFITS OF

$71 MILLION FROM AN EXCLUSION PROVIDED UNDER U.S. INCOME

TAX LAWS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME (ETI)

ATTRIBUTABLE TO FOREIGN TRADING GROSS RECEIPTS. THE WORLD TRADE

ORGANIZATION (WTO) HAS RULED THAT THIS ETI EXCLUSION REPRESENTS

A PROHIBITED EXPORT SUBSIDY UNDER THE WTO AGREEMENT ON SUBSIDIES

AND COUNTERVAILING MEASURES. BASED UPON THIS RULING, A WTO

ARBITRATION PANEL HAS DETERMINED THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU)

MAY IMPOSE UP TO $4 BILLION PER YEAR IN TRADE SANCTIONS

AGAINST THE U.S., ALTHOUGH THE EU HAS YET TO IMPOSE SUCH

SANCTIONS. PRESIDENT BUSH HAS STATED THAT THE U.S. WILL CHANGE

ITS TAX LAWS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE WTO RULING. VARIOUS

LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS PROVIDING FOR THE REPEAL OF THE ETI

EXCLUSION HAVE INTRODUCED BROAD-BASED INTERNATIONAL TAX REFORMS,

BUT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS HAVE NOT YET AGREED

UPON A SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE. SINCE THE IMPACT OF THIS MATTER

UPON THE COMPANY DEPENDS UPON THE ACTIONS OF THE EU AND THE

SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF ANY TAX LEGISLATION ULTIMATELY ENACTED BY

CONGRESS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE IMPACT ON FUTURE

FINANCIAL RESULTS. HOWEVER, IF THE ETI EXCLUSION IS REPEALED AND

LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REPLACE THE ETI EXCLUSION BENEFIT IS NOT

ENACTED, THE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS TAX PROVISION COULD BE

SIGNIFICANT.

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY

AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME

TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. THE

INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) HAS COMPLETED ITS

EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANYS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR

1993 THROUGH 1995 AND HAS PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS THAT CHALLENGE

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS TAX POSITIONS. THE COMPANY HAS

NEGOTIATED THE SETTLEMENT OF A NUMBER OF THESE PROPOSED

ASSESSMENTS, AND IS PURSUING AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL BEFORE THE

IRS WITH REGARD TO THE REMAINDER. IF THE REMAINING PROPOSED

ASSESSMENTS ARE UPHELD THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL

PROCESS, THEY COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS

TAX POSITIONS COMPLY WITH APPLICABLE TAX LAW AND INTENDS TO

DEFEND ITS POSITIONS VIGOROUSLY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS

ADEQUATELY PROVIDED FOR ANY REASONABLY FORESEEABLE OUTCOME

RELATED TO THESE MATTERS. ACCORDINGLY, ALTHOUGH THEIR ULTIMATE

RESOLUTION MAY REQUIRE ADDITIONAL CASH TAX PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY

DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL EARNINGS IMPACT FROM THESE

MATTERS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY

FAVORABLY RESOLVED CERTAIN STATE INCOME TAX AUDIT ISSUES AND THE

CORRESPONDING RELEASE OF $56 MILLION OF RELATED TAX

RESERVES IS REFLECTED IN THE CURRENT YEAR INCOME TAX PROVISION.

AS A RESULT OF PENSION PLAN ASSET PERFORMANCE

BELOW EXPECTED RETURNS AND A REDUCTION OF THE DISCOUNT RATE TO

5.85%, A NUMBER OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLANS WERE

UNDERFUNDED AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, HAVING ACCUMULATED

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS EXCEEDING THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS. FOR

THESE PLANS, THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AGGREGATED

$2.6 BILLION, THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS

AGGREGATED $3.4 BILLION AND THE PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AGGREGATED $3.7 BILLION. AS A RESULT, THE

COMPANY RECORDED AN ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY

ADJUSTMENT OF $899 MILLION REPRESENTING THE AMOUNT BY WHICH

THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR THESE PLANS EXCEEDED THE

RELATED FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS, ADJUSTED FOR PREVIOUSLY

RECORDED AMOUNTS ON THE COMPANYS BALANCE SHEET. THE

AFTER-TAX ADJUSTMENT OF $564 MILLION WAS RECORDED AS A

REDUCTION OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN FISCAL 2003. IN THE PRIOR YEAR, THERE

WERE FEWER UNDERFUNDED PLANS. THESE UNDERFUNDED PLANS HAD

AGGREGATE PLAN ASSETS OF $324 MILLION, ACCUMULATED BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS OF $471 MILLION AND PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF

$495 MILLION. THE ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY

ADJUSTMENT RECORDED IN FISCAL 2002 WAS $70 MILLION WITH A

CORRESPONDING AFTER-TAX REDUCTION OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

OF $44 MILLION.

THE COMPANYS ACCUMULATED PENSION BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 AND 2002 WERE

$3.5 BILLION AND $2.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH

98.6% AND 98.5%, RESPECTIVELY, WERE VESTED.

THE MARKET VALUES OF THE COMPANYS SHARES

HELD BY THE PENSION PLAN MASTER TRUST FOR THESE PLANS AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 AND 2002 WERE $56 MILLION AND

$42 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES TO VARIOUS

PENSION AND OTHER PLANS UNDER UNION AND INDUSTRY-WIDE

AGREEMENTS. IN 2003, 2002 AND 2001, THE COST RECOGNIZED UNDER

THESE PLANS WERE $37 MILLION, $41 MILLION AND

$40 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AND FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS FOR POSTRETIREMENT

PLANS WITH ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS IN

EXCESS OF PLAN ASSETS WERE $1,035 MILLION AND

$197 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY FOR 2003, AND $680 MILLION

AND $199 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY FOR 2002.

CERTAIN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS THE

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES, THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE

AND THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN, HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON

THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT AND NET

PERIODIC PENSION EXPENSE AS WELL AS THE RESPECTIVE BENEFIT

OBLIGATION AMOUNTS. THE COMPANY REVIEWS EXTERNAL DATA AND ITS

OWN HISTORICAL TRENDS FOR HEALTH CARE COSTS TO DETERMINE THE

HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL

BENEFIT PLANS. FOR

-95-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2003, WE ASSUMED A 10.00% ANNUAL RATE OF INCREASE

IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTH CARE CLAIMS WITH THE

RATE DECREASING IN EVEN INCREMENTS OVER 7 YEARS UNTIL

REACHING 5.0%. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE FOR PENSION PLANS

REPRESENTS THE MARKET RATE FOR HIGH-QUALITY FIXED INCOME

INVESTMENTS OR A LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BOND RATE. FOR

2003, WE REDUCED OUR RATE TO 5.85% TO REFLECT MARKET INTEREST

RATE CONDITIONS. THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN FOR PLAN ASSETS IS

BASED ON CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATIONS, AS WELL AS

HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON VARIOUS CATEGORIES OF PLAN

ASSETS. WE ASSUMED AN EXPECTED RETURN ON PLANS ASSETS OF 8.5%

FOR 2003.

THE EFFECT OF A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE AND

A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED LONG-TERM HEALTH

CARE COST TREND RATE, ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE AND THE LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WOULD HAVE HAD THE FOLLOWING

THE COMPANY HAS SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLANS THAT

ALLOW ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO ALLOCATE UP TO 20% OF SALARY THROUGH

PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS DEPENDING ON THE PLAN IN WHICH THE EMPLOYEE

PARTICIPATES. THE COMPANY MATCHES 50% OF THE EMPLOYEES

PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS, UP TO PLAN LIMITS. IN 2003, 2002 AND

2001, THE COSTS OF THESE PLANS WERE $32 MILLION,

$29 MILLION AND $32 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

THE COMPANY DECLARED AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF $0.21

PER SHARE ON DECEMBER 2, 2003 RELATED TO FISCAL 2003. THE

DIVIDEND IS PAYABLE ON JANUARY 6, 2004 TO SHAREHOLDERS OF

RECORD ON DECEMBER 12, 2003. THE COMPANY PAID A

$429 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.21 PER DISNEY SHARE) DURING THE

FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003 APPLICABLE TO FISCAL 2002, AND PAID

A $428 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.21 PER DISNEY SHARE) DURING THE

FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2002 APPLICABLE TO FISCAL 2001.

IN DECEMBER 1999, PURSUANT TO THE

COMPANYS REPURCHASE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED THE

TWDC STOCK COMPENSATION FUND II TO ACQUIRE SHARES OF

COMPANY COMMON STOCK FOR THE PURPOSE OF FUNDING CERTAIN FUTURE

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. THE FUND EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 12,

2002. ON THAT DATE, THE 5,359,485 SHARES OF THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK STILL OWNED BY THE FUND WERE TRANSFERRED BACK TO

THE COMPANY AND WERE CLASSIFIED AS TREASURY STOCK.

UNDER ITS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, THE COMPANY

IS AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE APPROXIMATELY 330 MILLION

SHARES AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. NO SHARES WERE REPURCHASED

DURING THE CURRENT YEAR. DURING FISCAL 2001, THE COMPANY

REPURCHASED A TOTAL OF 63.9 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON

STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST

RATE CHANGES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO MANAGE THE

IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND

ON THE MARKET VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ITS FIXED RATE

DEBT EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM

AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE.

THE COMPANY TYPICALLY USES PAY FLOATING AND PAY

FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO FACILITATE ITS INTEREST RATE RISK

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. PAY-FLOATING SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT

FIXED RATE MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS TO VARIABLE RATE

INSTRUMENTS INDEXED TO LIBOR. THESE SWAP AGREEMENTS EXPIRE IN

THREE TO 19 YEARS. PAY-FIXED SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FLOATING

RATE OBLIGATIONS TO FIXED RATE INSTRUMENTS. THE PAY-FIXED SWAPS

EXPIRE IN ONE TO EIGHT YEARS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 AND

2002 RESPECTIVELY, THE COMPANY HELD $711 MILLION AND

$300 MILLION OF PAY-FIXED SWAPS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS

HEDGES. THE CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES OF ALL SWAPS THAT DO NOT

QUALITY AS HEDGES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS.

THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR FISCAL 2003, 2002 AND 2001.

THE NET AMOUNT OF DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES IN AOCI FROM

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT TRANSACTIONS AT SEPTEMBER 30,

2003 WAS IMMATERIAL WHILE THE BALANCE AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002

WAS A LOSS OF $41 MILLION.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY TRANSACTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND IS

SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND

CASH FLOW FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE

CHANGES THEREBY ENABLING MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON CORE

BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT

CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE

VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, FIRM

COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED FOREIGN

CURRENCY REVENUES. THE COMPANY USES OPTION STRATEGIES AND

FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUES. IN ACCORDANCE

WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY HEDGES A MINIMUM PERCENTAGE (NOT TO

EXCEED A MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE) OF ITS FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS FOR

PERIODS GENERALLY NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS. THE COMPANY ALSO

USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS,

LIABILITIES AND FIRM COMMITMENTS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE

CONTRACTS OFFSET GAINS

-99-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OR LOSSES ON THE RELATED FORECASTED TRANSACTION,

ASSET, LIABILITY OR FIRM COMMITMENT. THE PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES

HEDGED ARE THE EUROPEAN EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN AND

CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY

CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLARS.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON CONTRACTS HEDGING FORECASTED

FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES ARE INITIALLY RECORDED TO AOCI, AND

RECLASSIFIED TO CURRENT EARNINGS WHEN SUCH REVENUES ARE

RECOGNIZED, OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN

CURRENCY REVENUES. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 AND 2002, THE

COMPANY HAD PRE-TAX DEFERRED GAINS OF $23 MILLION AND

$66 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND PRE-TAX DEFERRED LOSSES OF

$203 MILLION AND $85 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE TRANSACTIONS.

DEFERRED AMOUNTS TO BE RECOGNIZED CAN CHANGE WITH

MARKET CONDITIONS AND WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN

THE VALUE OF THE RELATED HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY

EXPECTS TO RECLASSIFY A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $134 MILLION TO

EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED A

$62 MILLION AFTER-TAX LOSS AND A $27 MILLION AFTER-TAX

GAIN FROM AOCI TO EARNINGS DURING FISCAL 2003 AND 2002,

RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS OFFSET BY NET GAINS AND LOSSES ON ITEMS

BEING HEDGED.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 AND 2002, CHANGES IN

VALUE RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES INCLUDED IN AOCI WERE A

PRE-TAX LOSS OF $175 MILLION AND $19 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED DEFERRED

LOSSES RELATED TO CERTAIN CASH FLOW HEDGES FROM AOCI TO

EARNINGS, DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE TIMING OF THE ORIGINAL

FORECASTED TRANSACTION. DURING FISCAL 2003 AND 2002, THE COMPANY

RECORDED THE CHANGE IN FAIR MARKET VALUE RELATED TO FAIR VALUE

HEDGES AND THE INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES TO

EARNINGS. THESE AMOUNTS WERE NOT MATERIAL. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ON OPERATING INCOME IN 2003

AND IN 2002 WAS A NET LOSS OF $273 MILLION AND A GAIN OF

$44 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

INVESTMENT RISK MANAGEMENT

DURING 2002 AND 2001, THE COMPANY HEDGED CERTAIN

INVESTMENT HOLDINGS USING FORWARD SALE CONTRACTS. THE CONTRACTS,

WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS TOTALING $530 MILLION IN 2002 AND

2001, WERE TERMINATED IN OCTOBER 2001. DURING 2003, THE COMPANY

DID NOT HEDGE INVESTMENT HOLDINGS USING FORWARD SALE CONTRACTS.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 AND 2002, THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED CASH, CASH

EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENTS, RECEIVABLES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE,

BORROWINGS AND INTEREST RATE, FORWARD AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 AND 2002, THE FAIR

VALUES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE APPROXIMATED CARRYING VALUES BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM

NATURE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES,

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS

WITH, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT

ARE COUNTERPARTIES TO ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND DOES NOT

ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY

WOULD NOT REALIZE A MATERIAL LOSS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003

IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY SINGLE COUNTERPARTY. THE

COMPANY ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS ONLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION

COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF A- OR BETTER. THE

COMPANYS CURRENT POLICY REGARDING AGREEMENTS WITH

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES IS GENERALLY TO REQUIRE

COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A- OR IN THE

EVENT AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED LIMITS AS DEFINED BY CONTRACT.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT CREDIT

EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2003, COUNTERPARTIES HAD PLEDGED A TOTAL OF $49 MILLION OF

CASH COLLATERAL.

THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES AND

INVESTMENTS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF

CREDIT RISK AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003 DUE TO THE WIDE VARIETY

OF CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS INTO WHICH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS

ARE SOLD, THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS MANY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND THE

DIVERSIFICATION OF THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO AMONG

INSTRUMENTS AND ISSUERS.

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY

COMPANY.

IN THIS LAWSUIT, FILED ON

FEBRUARY 27, 1991 AND PENDING IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY

SUPERIOR COURT, THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT A COMPANY SUBSIDIARY

DEFRAUDED IT AND BREACHED A 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH

RESPECT TO CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH PROPERTIES, BY FAILING TO

ACCOUNT FOR AND PAY ROYALTIES ON REVENUES EARNED FROM THE SALE

OF WINNIE THE POOH MOVIES ON VIDEOCASSETTE AND FROM THE

EXPLOITATION OF WINNIE THE POOH MERCHANDISING RIGHTS. THE

PLAINTIFF SEEKS DAMAGES FOR THE LICENSEES ALLEGED BREACHES

AS WELL AS CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAINTIFFS INTERPRETATION

OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE ACTIVITIES.

THE PLAINTIFF ALSO SEEKS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT ON

THE BASIS OF THE ALLEGED BREACHES. THE COMPANY DISPUTES THAT THE

PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER RELIEF OF ANY

KIND, INCLUDING TERMINATION OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT. IF EACH

OF THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS WERE TO BE CONFIRMED IN A FINAL

JUDGMENT, DAMAGES AS ARGUED BY THE PLAINTIFF COULD TOTAL AS MUCH

AS SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE

VALUE TO THE COMPANY OF ANY FUTURE EXPLOITATION OF THE LICENSED

RIGHTS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES AND THE

UNCERTAINTY OF THEIR ULTIMATE DISPOSITION, MANAGEMENT IS UNABLE

TO PREDICT THE MAGNITUDE OF ANY POTENTIAL DETERMINATION OF THE

PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS. ON APRIL 24, 2003, THE MATTER WAS

REMOVED TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL

DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, WHICH, ON MAY 19, 2003, DISMISSED

CERTAIN CLAIMS AND REMANDED THE MATTER TO THE LOS ANGELES

SUPERIOR COURT. THE COMPANY HAS APPEALED FROM THE DISTRICT

COURTS ORDER TO THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH

CIRCUIT. IN THE MEANWHILE, THE SUPERIOR COURT HAS ASSIGNED THE

CASE TO A DIFFERENT JUDGE IN THE COURTS COMPLEX LITIGATION

PILOT PROGRAM. PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS CONTINUE IN THE STATE COURT.

A. A. MILNE, AUTHOR OF THE WINNIE THE POOH BOOKS, AND

THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. FILED A

COMPLAINT AGAINST STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. (SSI) IN

THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF

CALIFORNIA. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2002, MS. MILNE SERVED

NOTICES TO SSI AND THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY TERMINATING

A. A. MILNES PRIOR GRANT OF RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE

POOH, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004, AND GRANTED ALL OF THOSE

RIGHTS TO THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY. IN THEIR LAWSUIT,

MS. MILNE AND THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY SEEK A

DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, UNDER UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT LAW, THAT

MS. MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE VALID; THAT

SSIS RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH IN THE UNITED STATES WILL

TERMINATE EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004; THAT UPON TERMINATION

OF SSIS RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 1983 LICENSING

AGREEMENT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC.

V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

LAWSUIT WILL TERMINATE BY

OPERATION OF LAW; AND THAT, AS OF NOVEMBER 5, 2004, SSI

WILL BE ENTITLED TO NO FURTHER ROYALTIES FOR USES OF WINNIE THE

POOH. IN JANUARY 2003, SSI FILED (A) AN ANSWER DENYING

THE MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT AND

(B) COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING A DECLARATION (I) THAT

MS. MILNES GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DISNEY ENTERPRISES,

INC. IS VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE AND (II) THAT DISNEY

ENTERPRISES, INC. REMAINS OBLIGATED TO PAY SSI ROYALTIES UNDER

THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT. SSI ALSO FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS

THE COMPLAINT OR, IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. ON

MAY 8, 2003, THE COURT RULED THAT MILNES TERMINATION

NOTICES ARE INVALID AND DISMISSED SSIS COUNTERCLAIMS AS

MOOT. FOLLOWING FURTHER MOTIONS, ON AUGUST 1, 2003, SSI

FILED AN AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS AND A THIRD-PARTY

COMPLAINT AGAINST HARRIET HUNT (HEIR TO E. H. SHEPARD,

ILLUSTRATOR OF THE ORIGINAL WINNIE THE POOH STORIES), WHO HAD

SERVED A NOTICE OF TERMINATION AND A GRANT OF RIGHTS SIMILAR TO

MS. MILNES. BY ORDER DATED OCTOBER 27, 2003, THE

COURT CERTIFIED AN INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL FROM ITS MAY 8 ORDER TO

THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT AND MILNE AND DISNEY

HAVE PETITIONED THE COURT OF APPEAL ACCORDINGLY.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT CURRENTLY

POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ULTIMATE

RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.

AL.

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK BETWEEN AUGUST 15, 1997 AND

MAY 15, 2002. SUBSEQUENTLY, AT LEAST NINE SUBSTANTIALLY

CONTEND THAT A DECLINE IN THE STOCK PRICE RESULTED FROM THE

MAY 2002 DISCLOSURE. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK COMPENSATORY

DAMAGES AND/OR RESCISSION FOR THEMSELVES AND ALL MEMBERS OF

THEIR DEFINED CLASS. SEVERAL OF THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED

MOTIONS ASKING THE COURT TO APPOINT LEAD PLAINTIFFS AND COUNSEL,

AND TO CONSOLIDATE THE RELATED ACTIONS INTO A SINGLE CASE. ON

DECEMBER 10, 2002, PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO CONSOLIDATE

THE RELATED ACTIONS INTO A SINGLE CASE WAS GRANTED, AND THEIR

MOTION FOR APPOINTMENT OF LEAD PLAINTIFFS AND COUNSEL WAS

GRANTED ON FEBRUARY 21, 2003. ON OR ABOUT APRIL 7,

2003, PLAINTIFFS FILED A CONSOLIDATED AMENDED CLASS ACTION

COMPLAINT AND ON MAY 22, 2003, DEFENDANTS MOVED TO DISMISS

THE COMPLAINT. THE COURT GRANTED DEFENDANTS MOTION AND THE

CASE WAS DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE ON OCTOBER 24, 2003.

CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR

CO-DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS INVOLVING COPYRIGHT,

BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE

CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE

AMERICA AND EUROPE. DURING FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED

THAT IT WAS PURSUING STRATEGIC OPTIONS FOR THE DISNEY STORE,

INCLUDING THE POSSIBLE SALE OF STORES IN NORTH AMERICA AND

EUROPE, IN ORDER TO FOCUS ON ITS CORE COMPETENCIES AND

ACTIVITIES INTENDED TO INCREASE CAPITAL RETURNS. IN CONNECTION

WITH PREPARING THE CHAIN FOR SALE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CLOSE

A CERTAIN NUMBER OF UNDERPERFORMING STORES IN NORTH AMERICA.

DURING FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED CHARGES

TOTALING $16 MILLION, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING FIXED ASSET

WRITE-DOWNS RELATED TO THE STORES IT EXPECTS TO CLOSE (AND

CERTAIN RELATED FACILITIES) AND THE COST OF CERTAIN

ADMINISTRATIVE HEADCOUNT REDUCTIONS. FIXED ASSETS ASSOCIATED

THEIR FAIR VALUE, DETERMINED ON THE BASIS OF ESTIMATED FUTURE

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS THROUGH THE EXPECTED DATE OF THE CLOSURES.

THE CHARGES ARE REPORTED IN RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

STORES THAT ARE SOLD. TOTAL FUTURE BASE RENT COMMITMENTS FOR THE

STORES THAT THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CLOSE WERE APPROXIMATELY

$54 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003. IN CONJUNCTION

WITH THE SALE NEGOTIATIONS, THE COMPANY WILL UNDERTAKE

NEGOTIATIONS WITH LESSORS TO SEEK FAVORABLE LEASE TERMINATION

TERMS FOR STORES THAT WILL BE CLOSED, BUT WILL LIKELY INCUR

CHARGES RELATED TO THE LEASE TERMINATIONS IN THE SECOND AND

THIRD QUARTERS OF FISCAL 2004. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME

TO DETERMINE WHAT AMOUNT WILL ULTIMATELY BE PAID TO TERMINATE

THESE LEASES. THE DISNEY STORE RESULTS ARE IN THE CONSUMER

PRODUCTS OPERATING SEGMENT.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COMPANY WILL RECOVER

ITS INVESTMENT IN STORES THAT WILL BE SOLD; HOWEVER, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT CERTAIN STORES CURRENTLY IDENTIFIED FOR SALE MAY

ULTIMATELY BE CLOSED WHICH COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CHARGES.

IN 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED RESTRUCTURING AND

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TOTALING $1.45 BILLION. THE GO.COM

CHARGE WAS FOR THE CLOSURE OF THE GO.COM PORTAL BUSINESS AND

INCLUDES A NON-CASH WRITE-OFF OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS TOTALING

BELOW. THE DISNEYQUEST AND DISNEY STORE CLOSURE CHARGES WERE FOR

THE CLOSURE OF THE CHICAGO FACILITY AND APPROXIMATELY 100 DISNEY

STORES AND INCLUDES THE WRITE-DOWN OF FIXED ASSETS AND LEASEHOLD

IMPROVEMENTS, LEASEHOLD TERMINATION COSTS, SEVERANCE AND OTHER

RELATED CLOSURE COSTS. THE ASSET

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS FOR CERTAIN LONG-LIVED

ASSETS, PRIMARILY AT THE DISNEY STORE AND DISNEY CATALOG. THESE

ASSETS WERE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT UNDER A HELD FOR USE MODEL

DUE TO DECLINING CASH FLOWS. FAIR VALUE WAS GENERALLY DETERMINED

BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2001, THE

COMPANY INITIATED A PLAN TO ELIMINATE 4,000 FULL-TIME JOBS

THROUGH A COMBINATION OF VOLUNTARY AND INVOLUNTARY REDUCTIONS.

THE REDUCTION AFFECTED EMPLOYEES IN ALL BUSINESS UNITS AND

GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. THE $111 MILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE WORKFORCE REDUCTION CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SEVERANCE

COSTS AND WRITE-OFFS OF IDLED FACILITIES. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, THE COMPANY HAD COMPLETED ITS WORKFORCE

REDUCTION.
