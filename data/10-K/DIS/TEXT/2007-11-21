CERTAIN OF OUR CABLE/SATELLITE NETWORKS AND OUR RADIO STATIONS COMPETE WITH OTHER TELEVISION NETWORKS AND RADIO STATIONS, INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATIONS, SUPPLIERS OF CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES AND OTHER ADVERTISING MEDIA SUCH AS NEWSPAPERS,

MAGAZINES, BILLBOARDS, AND THE INTERNET. FOR OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS, COMPETITION OCCURS PRIMARILY IN INDIVIDUAL MARKET AREAS. A TELEVISION OR RADIO STATION IN ONE MARKET GENERALLY DOES NOT COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH STATIONS IN OTHER MARKETS.

THE GROWTH IN THE CABLE AND SATELLITE INDUSTRYS SHARE OF VIEWERS HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FOR ADVERTISING

REVENUES FOR BOTH OUR BROADCASTING AND CABLE/SATELLITE NETWORKS. THE COMPANYS CABLE/SATELLITE NETWORKS ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER CABLE NETWORKS FOR CARRIAGE BY CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICE OPERATORS AND DISTRIBUTORS. THE COMPANYS

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH CABLE, SATELLITE AND TELEPHONE OPERATORS ARE RENEWED OR

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE CABLE AND SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY

AND OTHER FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS VARIOUS CABLE AND SATELLITE PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE.

THE COMPANYS MEDIA NETWORKS BUSINESSES ALSO COMPETE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING. THE MARKET FOR PROGRAMMING IS VERY

COMPETITIVE, PARTICULARLY FOR SPORTS PROGRAMMING. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS SPORTS RIGHTS AGREEMENTS WITH THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE (NFL), NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION (NBA), NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STOCK CAR AUTO RACING (NASCAR), MAJOR LEAGUE

BASEBALL (MLB), WORLD CUP, INDY RACING LEAGUE AND VARIOUS COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL CONFERENCES.

THE COMPANYS INTERNET WEB

SITES AND PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH OTHER WEB SITES AND PRODUCTS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CATEGORIES, WHICH INCLUDE KIDS, FAMILY, ENTERTAINMENT, SPORTS AND NEWS, AMONG OTHERS.

ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE MEDIA NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER

MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS ARE MET, AND THESE COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE

COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION DURING THIS PERIOD.

FEDERAL REGULATION

TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) UNDER FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS,

INCLUDING THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. VIOLATION OF FCC REGULATIONS CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY FORFEITURES, LIMITED RENEWALS OF LICENSES AND, IN EGREGIOUS CASES, DENIAL OF LICENSE RENEWAL OR REVOCATION OF A LICENSE. FCC

REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



LICENSING OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS.

EACH OF THE TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE OWN MUST BE LICENSED BY THE FCC. THESE LICENSES ARE GRANTED FOR

PERIODS OF UP TO EIGHT YEARS, AND WE MUST OBTAIN RENEWAL OF LICENSES AS THEY EXPIRE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OPERATING THE STATIONS. WE (OR THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN THE CASE OF A DIVESTITURE) MUST ALSO OBTAIN FCC APPROVAL WHENEVER WE SEEK TO HAVE A

LICENSE TRANSFERRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OR DIVESTITURE OF A STATION. THE FCC MAY DECLINE TO RENEW OR APPROVE THE TRANSFER OF A LICENSE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE GENERALLY RECEIVED SUCH RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE

PAST, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ALWAYS OBTAIN NECESSARY RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE FUTURE.



TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP LIMITS.

THE FCC IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SPECIFIC

MARKET, ON THE COMBINED NUMBER OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SINGLE MARKET AND ON THE AGGREGATE PERCENTAGE OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE THAT CAN BE REACHED BY TELEVISION STATIONS WE OWN. CURRENTLY.



FCC REGULATIONS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN A MARKET, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND NATURE OF THE MARKET. WE DO NOT OWN MORE

THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN ANY OF THE TEN MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN A TELEVISION STATION.



FEDERAL STATUTES PERMIT OUR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE AGGREGATE TO REACH A MAXIMUM OF 39% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE (FOR THIS PURPOSE, FCC REGULATIONS ATTRIBUTE TO

UHF TELEVISION STATIONS ONLY 50% OF THE TELEVISION HOUSEHOLDS IN THEIR MARKET). OUR STATIONS REACH APPROXIMATELY 24% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE (APPROXIMATELY 23% WHEN CALCULATED USING THE FCCS UHF DISCOUNT).



FCC REGULATIONS IN SOME CASES IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL RADIO OR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN RADIO STATIONS,

BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS ARE MATERIAL TO OUR CURRENT OPERATING PLANS.

IN JULY 2003, THE FCC ADOPTED

REVISED LIMITS ON TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP. THE RULES ADOPTED GENERALLY WOULD HAVE RELAXED EXISTING OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS AND PERMITTED ENTITIES TO OWN MORE TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS IN SOME MARKETS. THEY ALSO WOULD HAVE

ELIMINATED THE 50% DISCOUNT FOR CALCULATING HOUSEHOLDS REACHED BY UHF TELEVISION STATIONS OPERATED BY THE TOP FOUR BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS (INCLUDING ABC). THE NEW RULES, HOWEVER, WERE CHALLENGED IN FEDERAL COURT AND WERE REMANDED BY THE COURT

TO THE FCC TO REVIEW THE RULES. AS A RESULT,

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MOST OF THE REVISED RULES ADOPTED BY THE FCC IN JULY 2003 ARE NOT IN EFFECT. THE FCC HAS INITIATED A RULEMAKING IN RESPONSE TO THE COURT REMAND TO

RE-EVALUATE THESE RULES IN LIGHT OF THE COURT DECISION. ALTHOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FCC MAY IMPLEMENT MORE LIBERAL MEDIA OWNERSHIP RULES THAN THOSE CURRENTLY IN EFFECT (OTHER THAN THOSE GOVERNED BY STATUTE), WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THE

REVISED RULES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND IF SO, WHEN SUCH RULES WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE.



DUAL NETWORKS.

FCC RULES CURRENTLY PROHIBIT ANY OF THE FOUR MAJOR TELEVISION NETWORKS  ABC, CBS, FOX AND NBC  FROM BEING UNDER COMMON OWNERSHIP

OR CONTROL.



REGULATION OF PROGRAMMING.

THE FCC REGULATES PROGRAMMING BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BANNING INDECENT PROGRAMMING, REGULATING POLITICAL ADVERTISING

AND IMPOSING COMMERCIAL TIME LIMITS DURING CHILDRENS PROGRAMMING. BROADCASTERS FACE A HEIGHTENED RISK OF BEING FOUND IN VIOLATION OF THE INDECENCY PROHIBITION BY THE FCC BECAUSE OF RECENT FCC DECISIONS, COUPLED WITH THE SPONTANEITY OF LIVE

PROGRAMMING. RECENTLY, THE FCC HAS INDICATED THAT IT IS INCREASING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO INDECENCY, AND HAS INDICATED IT WOULD CONSIDER LICENSE REVOCATION FOR SERIOUS VIOLATIONS. MOREOVER, CONGRESS RECENTLY INCREASED PENALTIES FOR

BROADCASTING INDECENT PROGRAMMING TO A MAXIMUM OF $325,000 PER VIOLATION.

FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND FCC RULES ALSO LIMIT

THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL MATTER THAT MAY BE SHOWN ON BROADCAST OR CABLE CHANNELS DURING PROGRAMMING DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN 12 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. IN ADDITION, BROADCAST CHANNELS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF THREE HOURS PER

WEEK OF PROGRAMMING THAT HAS AS A SIGNIFICANT PURPOSE MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN 16 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. FCC RULES ALSO GIVE TELEVISION STATION OWNERS THE RIGHT TO REJECT OR REFUSE NETWORK

PROGRAMMING IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO SUBSTITUTE PROGRAMMING THAT THE LICENSEE REASONABLY BELIEVES TO BE OF GREATER LOCAL OR NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.



CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS.

WITH RESPECT TO CABLE SYSTEMS OPERATING WITHIN A TELEVISION STATIONS DESIGNATED MARKET

AREA, FCC RULES REQUIRE THAT EVERY THREE YEARS EACH TELEVISION STATION ELECT EITHER MUST CARRY STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH CABLE OPERATORS GENERALLY MUST CARRY A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION IN THE STATIONS MARKET, OR

RETRANSMISSION CONSENT STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE CABLE OPERATOR MUST NEGOTIATE WITH THE TELEVISION STATION TO OBTAIN THE CONSENT OF THE TELEVISION STATION PRIOR TO CARRYING ITS SIGNAL. UNDER THE SATELLITE HOME VIEWER IMPROVEMENT ACT

AND ITS SUCCESSOR, THE SATELLITE HOME VIEWER EXTENSION AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT, SATELLITE CARRIERS ARE PERMITTED TO RETRANSMIT A LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS SIGNAL INTO ITS LOCAL MARKET WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LOCAL TELEVISION STATION. IF A

SATELLITE CARRIER ELECTS TO CARRY ONE LOCAL STATION IN A MARKET, THE SATELLITE CARRIER MUST CARRY THE SIGNALS OF ALL LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS THAT ALSO REQUEST CARRIAGE. CERTAIN OF THE SATELLITE CARRIAGE PROVISIONS ARE SET TO EXPIRE ON

DECEMBER 31, 2009.



DIGITAL TELEVISION.

FCC RULES CURRENTLY REQUIRE FULL-POWER ANALOG TELEVISION STATIONS, SUCH AS OURS, TO PROVIDE DIGITAL SERVICE ON A SECOND BROADCAST CHANNEL

GRANTED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PHASE-IN OF DIGITAL BROADCASTING. FCC RULES ALSO REGULATE DIGITAL BROADCASTING TO ENSURE CONTINUED QUALITY CARRIAGE OF MANDATED FREE OVER-THE-AIR PROGRAM SERVICE. ALL OF THE COMPANYS STATIONS HAVE LAUNCHED DIGITAL

FACILITIES, AND WE ARE EVALUATING VARIOUS OPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO USE OF DIGITAL CHANNELS. UNDER A RECENTLY-ENACTED STATUTE, ALL BROADCASTERS ARE REQUIRED TO OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY IN DIGITAL MODE AND PERMANENTLY SURRENDER ONE OF THEIR TWO CHANNELS BY

FEBRUARY 17, 2009.

THE FOREGOING IS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND OTHER

LEGISLATION AND OF SPECIFIC FCC RULES AND POLICIES. THIS SUMMARY FOCUSES ON PROVISIONS MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE TO THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT, OTHER LEGISLATION, FCC RULES AND PUBLIC NOTICES AND RULINGS OF THE FCC FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FCCS REGULATORY AUTHORITY.

FCC LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND

THE COMPANY GENERALLY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER NEW LEGISLATION, COURT ACTION OR REGULATIONS, OR A CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OF APPLICATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF CURRENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY

THE COMPANY COMPETES IN ITS CHARACTER MERCHANDISING AND OTHER LICENSING, PUBLISHING, INTERACTIVE AND RETAIL ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER LICENSORS, PUBLISHERS AND RETAILERS OF CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES. BASED ON

INDEPENDENT SURVEYS, WE BELIEVE THE COMPANY IS THE LARGEST WORLDWIDE LICENSOR OF CHARACTER-BASED MERCHANDISE AND PRODUCER/DISTRIBUTOR OF CHILDRENS FILM-RELATED PRODUCTS BASED ON RETAIL SALES. OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE LICENSING AND RETAIL

DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF ANIMATED THEATRICAL RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION

THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ARE AFFECTED BY

ITS ABILITY TO EXPLOIT AND PROTECT AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS AND TRADE SECRETS. IMPORTANT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INCLUDES RIGHTS IN THE CONTENT OF MOTION PICTURES,

TELEVISION PROGRAMS, ELECTRONIC GAMES, SOUND RECORDINGS, CHARACTER LIKENESSES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, BOOKS AND MAGAZINES.

THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO EXPLOIT AND PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS AFFECTED BY THE STRENGTH AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. INADEQUATE LAWS OR ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY IN ONE COUNTRY CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE, DESPITE THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES,

THE FALLING PRICES OF DEVICES INCORPORATING SUCH NEW TECHNOLOGIES, AND INCREASED BROADBAND INTERNET SPEED AND PENETRATION HAVE MADE INFRINGEMENT EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT MORE CHALLENGING. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES

TO PROTECTING ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED USE IN THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN MARKETS.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO

THE RISK OF CHALLENGES BY THIRD PARTIES CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT OF THEIR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR VALIDITY, SUCH CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERSION OF RESOURCES WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

FOR AN ENTERPRISE AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS THE COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF

FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS AFFECTING SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPERATIONS IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THESE OPERATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS

ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

CHANGES IN U.S., GLOBAL, OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

A DECREASE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES OR

IN OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, THUS REDUCING OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS. A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD REDUCE ATTENDANCE AND SPENDING AT ONE OR MORE OF OUR PARKS

AND RESORTS, PURCHASE OF OR PRICES FOR ADVERTISING ON OUR BROADCAST OR CABLE NETWORKS OR OWNED STATIONS, PRICES THAT CABLE OPERATORS WILL PAY FOR OUR CABLE PROGRAMMING, PERFORMANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT RELEASES, AND PURCHASES OF

COMPANY-BRANDED CONSUMER PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN PRICE LEVELS GENERALLY, OR IN PRICE LEVELS IN A PARTICULAR SECTOR SUCH AS THE ENERGY SECTOR, COULD RESULT IN A SHIFT IN CONSUMER DEMAND AWAY FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS

WE OFFER, WHICH COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASE OUR COSTS. CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY REDUCE INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCREASE OUR LABOR OR SUPPLY COSTS IN NON-UNITED

STATES MARKETS, OR REDUCE THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR VALUE OF REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER MARKETS.

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LABOR DISPUTES MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN VARIOUS OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF

OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS AS WELL AS WRITERS, DIRECTORS, ACTORS, PRODUCTION PERSONNEL AND OTHERS EMPLOYED IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS AND STUDIO OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE EMPLOYEES OF LICENSEES WHO MANUFACTURE AND RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER

PRODUCTS MAY BE COVERED BY LABOR AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS. COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WITH GUILDS AND UNIONS REPRESENTING WRITERS, DIRECTORS, ACTORS, TECHNICIANS AND OTHERS EITHER HAVE EXPIRED OR ARE SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE DURING FISCAL

2008, AND NEGOTIATIONS WITH SOME OF THESE GUILDS AND UNIONS HAVE TAKEN PLACE, ARE SCHEDULED OR ARE UNDERWAY. IN GENERAL, A LABOR DISPUTE INVOLVING OUR EMPLOYEES OR THE EMPLOYEES OF OUR LICENSEES OR RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS MAY

DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUES, AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS. ON NOVEMBER 5, 2007, MEMBERS OF THE WRITERS GUILD OF AMERICA COMMENCED A WORK STOPPAGE. ON NOVEMBER 10, 2007, MEMBERS OF LOCAL ONE OF THE

INTERNATIONAL ALLIANCE OF THEATRICAL STAGE EMPLOYEES COMMENCED A WORK STOPPAGE AFFECTING ONE OF THE COMPANYS THEATRICAL PRODUCTIONS IN NEW YORK CITY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THIS WORK STOPPAGE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL RESULTS. WITH RESPECT TO THE WORK STOPPAGE BY THE WRITERS GUILD OF AMERICA, IF THIS OR ANOTHER WORK STOPPAGE BY UNIONS INVOLVED IN THE PRODUCTION OF TELEVISION OR FILM PROGRAMMING IS PROLONGED, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO PRODUCE OR

AIR ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING OR PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE NEW THEATRICAL RELEASES, EITHER OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE. WHILE WE WOULD PURSUE MEASURES TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF A SUSTAINED WORK STOPPAGE THROUGH ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMMING AND

REDUCTION OF COSTS, WE EXPECT THAT A CONTINUED WORK STOPPAGE COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR PROFITABILITY.

CHANGES IN PUBLIC AND CONSUMER TASTES

AND PREFERENCES FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES CREATES ENTERTAINMENT OR CONSUMER PRODUCTS WHOSE SUCCESS DEPENDS SUBSTANTIALLY ON CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES THAT CHANGE IN

OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO CONSISTENTLY CREATE AND DISTRIBUTE FILMED ENTERTAINMENT, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, RESORT FACILITIES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE

CHANGING PREFERENCES OF THE BROAD CONSUMER MARKET. MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON WORLDWIDE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS, AND THEIR SUCCESS THEREFORE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT AND ADAPT TO CHANGING

CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES OUTSIDE AS WELL AS INSIDE THE UNITED STATES. MOREOVER, WE MUST OFTEN INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN FILM PRODUCTION, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, OR RESORT FACILITIES BEFORE WE LEARN THE

EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PRODUCTS WILL EARN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. IF OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, OUR REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING SALES (WHICH ARE BASED IN PART ON RATINGS FOR THE PROGRAMS IN WHICH

ADVERTISEMENTS AIR) OR SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, FROM THEATRICAL FILM RECEIPTS OR HOME VIDEO SALES, FROM THEME PARK ADMISSIONS, RESORT ROOM CHARGES AND MERCHANDISE, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES, FROM SALES OF LICENSED

CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR FROM SALES OF OUR OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY DECLINE AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES.

CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND IN CONSUMER CONSUMPTION PATTERNS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS OR THE COST OF PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTS.

THE MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE, DEVELOP, ADOPT AND EXPLOIT NEW

TECHNOLOGIES TO DISTINGUISH OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGIES AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THE TIME AND MANNER IN WHICH CONSUMERS ACQUIRE AND VIEW SOME OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND THE

OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO ADVERTISERS FOR REACHING THEIR DESIRED MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE.



THE SUCCESS OF OUR OFFERINGS IN THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET DEPENDS IN PART ON CONSUMER PREFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO HOME ENTERTAINMENT FORMATS, INCLUDING DVD

PLAYERS AND PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDERS, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE HOME ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING WEB-BASED DELIVERY OF ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS;



TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OFFER CONSUMERS AN EXPANDING ARRAY OF ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS AND IF CONSUMERS FAVOR OPTIONS WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED RATHER THAN

THE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS WE OFFER, OUR SALES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF PROTECTING THESE RIGHTS OR REDUCE

OUR REVENUES.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON MAINTENANCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE CREATE. NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION, AND ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES, THE FALLING PRICES OF DEVICES INCORPORATING SUCH TECHNOLOGIES, AND INCREASED BROADBAND INTERNET SPEED AND PENETRATION

HAVE MADE THE UNAUTHORIZED DIGITAL COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR FILMS, TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND OTHER CREATIVE WORKS EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MORE CHALLENGING. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT UNAUTHORIZED USE OF

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY GENERALLY IS A SIGNIFICANT AND RAPIDLY GROWING PHENOMENON. THESE DEVELOPMENTS REQUIRE US TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED USE AND

PRESENT THE RISK OF INCREASED LOSSES OF REVENUE AS A RESULT OF UNAUTHORIZED DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION OF OUR CONTENT AND SALES OF UNAUTHORIZED DVDS AND OTHER COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS.

A VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR INCREASE THE COST OF PROVIDING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PARTICULARLY OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS, IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENT FOR

TRAVEL AND TOURISM. THE ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM, AS WELL AS DEMAND FOR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE UNITED STATES, GLOBALLY OR IN SPECIFIC REGIONS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS BEYOND

OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING: ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR NATURAL DISASTERS (SUCH AS EXCESSIVE HEAT OR RAIN, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES); HEALTH CONCERNS; INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL OR MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS; AND TERRORIST ATTACKS. THESE EVENTS AND OTHERS,

SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN TRAVEL AND ENERGY COSTS AND COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACKS OR OTHER WIDESPREAD COMPUTING OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, MAY ALSO DAMAGE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO

THESE EVENTS. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE ROYALTIES FROM THE SALES OF OUR LICENSED GOODS AND SERVICES BY THIRD PARTIES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESSES OPERATED UNDER BRANDS LICENSED FROM THE COMPANY, AND WE ARE THEREFORE DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESSES OF

THOSE THIRD PARTIES FOR THAT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE. A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS COULD INFLUENCE THE SUCCESS OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES AND IF NEGATIVE FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF OUR LICENSEES THEY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE OBTAIN INSURANCE AGAINST THE RISK OF LOSSES RELATING TO SOME BUT NOT ALL OF THESE EVENTS, AND WHEN INSURANCE IS OBTAINED IT IS SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES, EXCLUSIONS AND CAPS. THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF

COVERAGE WE OBTAIN VARY FROM TIME TO TIME DEPENDING ON OUR VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SPECIFIC TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS IN RELATION TO THE COST OF OBTAINING COVERAGE FOR SUCH TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS.

CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS OR OTHERWISE AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OCCUR WE MAY NEED TO ADJUST OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES TO MEET THESE CHANGES OR WE MAY OTHERWISE FIND IT NECESSARY TO

RESTRUCTURE OUR OPERATIONS OR PARTICULAR BUSINESSES OR ASSETS. IN ADDITION, EXTERNAL EVENTS INCLUDING ACCEPTANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL OFFERINGS AND CHANGES IN MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS. WHEN THESE CHANGES OR EVENTS

OCCUR, WE MAY INCUR COSTS TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND MAY NEED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF ASSETS. WE MAY ALSO NEED TO INVEST IN NEW BUSINESSES THAT HAVE SHORT-TERM RETURNS THAT ARE NEGATIVE OR LOW AND WHOSE ULTIMATE BUSINESS PROSPECTS ARE

UNCERTAIN. IN ANY OF THESE EVENTS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE, WE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS OR RETURNS ON NEW INVESTMENTS MAY BE LOWER THAN PRIOR TO THE CHANGE IN STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING.

MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS MAY IMPEDE ACCESS TO OR INCREASE THE COST OF FINANCING OUR OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS.

CHANGES IN U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND EQUITY MARKETS, INCLUDING MARKET DISRUPTIONS AND SIGNIFICANT INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, MAY MAKE IT MORE

DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS OR INCREASE THE COST OF OBTAINING FINANCING. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES WHICH

ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. A DECREASE IN THESE RATINGS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO

OBTAIN FINANCING.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES FROM ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER AND FROM OTHER FORMS OF

ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO MUST COMPETE TO OBTAIN HUMAN RESOURCES, PROGRAMMING AND OTHER RESOURCES WE REQUIRE IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND STATIONS COMPETE FOR VIEWERS WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES AS WELL AS WITH HOME VIDEO PRODUCTS AND

INTERNET USAGE.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND STATIONS COMPETE FOR THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES, AS WELL AS NEWSPAPER,

MAGAZINES, BILLBOARDS AND THE INTERNET.



OUR CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR CARRIAGE OF THEIR PROGRAMMING WITH OTHER PROGRAMMING PROVIDERS.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CREATIVE TALENT AND SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING WITH OTHER BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS.



OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS COMPETE FOR GUESTS WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATION ACTIVITIES.



OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT COMPETES IN THE CHARACTER MERCHANDISING AND OTHER LICENSING, PUBLISHING, INTERACTIVE AND RETAIL ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER LICENSORS,

PUBLISHERS AND RETAILERS OF CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES.

COMPETITION IN EACH OF THESE AREAS MAY DIVERT

CONSUMERS FROM OUR CREATIVE OR OTHER PRODUCTS, OR TO OTHER PRODUCTS OR OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR MARKETING COSTS. COMPETITION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF RESOURCES CAN INCREASE THE COST OF PRODUCING OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

SUSTAINED INCREASES IN COSTS OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND OTHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR

PROFITABILITY.

WITH MORE THAN 137,000 EMPLOYEES, OUR PROFITABILITY IS SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED BY COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS AND CURRENT

AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. IN SOME RECENT YEARS, WE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THESE COSTS AS A RESULT OF MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN INVESTMENT

RETURNS AND DISCOUNT RATES USED TO CALCULATE PENSION AND RELATED LIABILITIES MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS IN SOME YEARS. AT LEAST SOME OF THESE MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS MAY PUT UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING PENSION AND

MEDICAL BENEFITS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE COULD REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF LONG-TERM PROGRAMMING OR CARRIAGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT RENEWED ON SUFFICIENTLY FAVORABLE TERMS.

WE ENTER INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR BOTH THE ACQUISITION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTS FOR THE

ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS FOR SPORTING EVENTS AND OTHER PROGRAMS, AND CONTRACTS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PROGRAMMING TO CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS. AS THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRE, WE MUST RENEW OR RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS, AND IF WE ARE

UNABLE TO RENEW THEM ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY LOSE PROGRAMMING RIGHTS OR DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS. EVEN IF THESE CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED, THE COST OF OBTAINING PROGRAMMING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE (OR INCREASE AT FASTER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE)

OR THE REVENUE FROM DISTRIBUTION OF PROGRAMS MAY BE REDUCED (OR INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE). WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, THE IMPACT OF THESE LONG-TERM

CONTRACTS ON OUR RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT REVENUES FROM

PROGRAMMING BASED ON THESE RIGHTS WILL EXCEED THE COST OF THE RIGHTS PLUS THE OTHER COSTS OF PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAMMING.

CHANGES IN REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES MAY IMPAIR THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BROADCAST NETWORKS AND TELEVISION STATIONS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED, AND EACH OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF UNITED STATES AND

OVERSEAS REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATIONS INCLUDE.



UNITED STATES FCC REGULATION OF OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO NETWORKS AND OWNED STATIONS, INCLUDING LICENSING OF STATIONS, OWNERSHIP LIMITS, PROHIBITIONS ON

INDECENT PROGRAMMING AND RESTRICTIONS ON COMMERCIAL TIME IN CHILDRENS PROGRAMMING AND REGULATION OF OUR BROADCASTING BUSINESSES IN NON-UNITED STATES MARKETS. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING FCC REGULATION IS PROVIDED IN ITEM



REGULATION OF THE SAFETY OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND THEME PARK OPERATIONS.



IMPOSITION BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES OF TRADE RESTRICTIONS OR MOTION PICTURE OR TELEVISION CONTENT REQUIREMENTS OR QUOTAS.

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TAX LAWS OR CURRENCY CONTROLS.

CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE REGULATORY AREAS MAY REQUIRE US TO SPEND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS, OR MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE PROFITABLE.

THE COMPANYS ACQUISITION OF PIXAR CAUSES SHORT TERM DILUTION IN EARNINGS PER SHARE AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANTICIPATED IMPROVEMENTS IN EARNINGS PER

SHARE WILL BE REALIZED.

ON MAY 5, 2006, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ALL STOCK ACQUISITION OF PIXAR. TO PURCHASE PIXAR, DISNEY

EXCHANGED 2.3 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR EACH SHARE OF PIXAR COMMON STOCK, RESULTING IN THE ISSUANCE OF 279 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK AND CONVERTED PREVIOUSLY ISSUED VESTED AND UNVESTED PIXAR EQUITY-BASED AWARDS INTO

APPROXIMATELY 45 MILLION DISNEY EQUITY-BASED AWARDS.

AS ANTICIPATED, THE EARNINGS CONTRIBUTED BY PIXARS OPERATIONS IN FISCAL

2007 PER SHARE ISSUED IN THE TRANSACTION WERE LESS THAN THE EARNINGS PER SHARE OF THE REMAINDER OF OUR BUSINESSES, EFFECTIVELY REDUCING EARNINGS PER SHARE IN FISCAL 2007 COMPARED TO WHAT EARNINGS PER SHARE WOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE ABSENCE OF THE

TRANSACTION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES, HOWEVER, THAT THE TRANSACTION YIELDS BENEFITS BEYOND THE EARNINGS CONTRIBUTED BY THE OPERATIONS OF PIXAR AND THAT THE TRANSACTION WILL ULTIMATELY BE ACCRETIVE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS PER SHARE EXPECTED IN THE LONGER TERM WILL BE ACHIEVED. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE INCREASES IN EARNINGS PER SHARE AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY WILL, AMONG OTHER THINGS, NEED TO EFFECTIVELY CONTINUE THE SUCCESSFUL

OPERATIONS OF PIXAR, DEVELOP SUCCESSFUL SEQUELS TO PRIOR PIXAR PRODUCTIONS AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE DISNEY FEATURE ANIMATION BUSINESS.

PROVISIONS IN OUR CORPORATE DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE STATE LAW COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL, EVEN IF THAT CHANGE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO SHAREHOLDERS.

OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION CONTAINS A PROVISION REGULATING THE ABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BRING MATTERS FOR ACTION BEFORE ANNUAL AND

SPECIAL MEETINGS AND AUTHORIZES OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE AND SET THE TERMS OF PREFERRED STOCK. THE REGULATIONS ON SHAREHOLDER ACTION COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ANY PERSON SEEKING TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN SHAREHOLDER

APPROVAL OF ACTIONS THAT WOULD SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD EFFECTIVELY DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF ANY PERSON SEEKING CONTROL OR OTHERWISE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN CONTROL. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, WHICH COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE OF CONTROL IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SEASONALITY OF CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES COULD EXACERBATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES IS NORMALLY SUBJECT TO SEASONAL VARIATIONS, AS FOLLOWS.



REVENUES IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. IN GENERAL, ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE SOMEWHAT

HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS ARE MET, AND THESE

COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION DURING THIS PERIOD.



REVENUES IN OUR PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY RESULTING FROM THE SEASONAL NATURE OF VACATION TRAVEL

AND LOCAL ENTERTAINMENT EXCURSIONS. PEAK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY GENERALLY OCCUR DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN SCHOOL VACATIONS OCCUR AND DURING EARLY-WINTER AND SPRING-HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT, AND TELEVISION MARKETS.

RELEASE DATES ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF ANIMATED THEATRICAL RELEASES

AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS.

ACCORDINGLY, IF A SHORT TERM NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OCCURS DURING A TIME OF

HIGH SEASONAL DEMAND (SUCH AS HURRICANE DAMAGE TO OUR PARKS DURING THE SUMMER TRAVEL SEASON), THE EFFECT COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF THAT BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

MILNE AND DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. V. STEPHEN SLESINGER,

INC

. ON NOVEMBER 5, 2002, CLARE MILNE, THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A. A. MILNE, AUTHOR OF THE WINNIE THE POOH BOOKS, AND THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. (DEI) FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. (SSI) IN

THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2002, MS. MILNE SERVED NOTICES TO SSI AND DEI TERMINATING A. A. MILNES PRIOR GRANT OF RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5,

2004, AND GRANTED ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS TO DEI. IN THEIR LAWSUIT, MS. MILNE AND DEI SOUGHT A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, UNDER UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT LAW, THAT MS. MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE VALID; THAT SSIS RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE

POOH IN THE UNITED STATES TERMINATED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004; THAT UPON TERMINATION OF SSIS RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

LAWSUIT TERMINATED BY OPERATION OF LAW; AND THAT, AS OF NOVEMBER 5, 2004, SSI WAS ENTITLED TO NO FURTHER ROYALTIES FOR USES OF WINNIE THE POOH. SSI FILED (A) AN ANSWER DENYING THE MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT AND

(B) COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT (I) MS. MILNES GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI IS VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE AND (II) DEI REMAINS OBLIGATED TO PAY SSI ROYALTIES UNDER THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT. THE DISTRICT COURT

RULED THAT MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE INVALID. THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED, AND ON JUNE 26, 2006, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DENIED MILNES PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI. ON

JUNE 23, 2003, SSI FILED AN AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS AND A THIRD-PARTY COMPLAINT AGAINST HARRIET HUNT (HEIR TO E. H. SHEPARD, ILLUSTRATOR OF THE ORIGINAL WINNIE THE POOH STORIES), WHO HAD SERVED A NOTICE OF TERMINATION AND A GRANT OF

RIGHTS SIMILAR TO MS. MILNES, AND ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE MILNE AND HUNT TERMINATIONS AND THE GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI FOR (A) UNLAWFUL AND UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES; AND (B) BREACH OF

THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT.

ON OCTOBER 19, 2006, THE PARTIES STIPULATED TO SSIS FILING ITS FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND

COUNTERCLAIMS (FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER) SEEKING (A) TO INVALIDATE THE HUNT TERMINATION NOTICE, (B) TO TERMINATE THE COMPANYS RIGHTS VIS-À-VIS SSI, AND (C) DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS, AMONG OTHER

RELIEF. THAT STIPULATION ALSO PROVIDED THAT HUNT AND THE COMPANY NEED NOT RESPOND TO THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF TWO EVENTS: THE STATE COURT APPEAL IN

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

, AND THE

TRIAL IN THE DISTRICT COURT ON THE VALIDITY OF THE HUNT TERMINATION NOTICE. SSI THEN SOUGHT TO WITHDRAW BOTH THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND ITS STIPULATION, BUT ON NOVEMBER 3, 2006, THE DISTRICT COURT DENIED THAT

REQUEST.

SSIS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE VALIDITY OF HUNTS 2002 ATTEMPT TO RECAPTURE E. H. SHEPARDS RIGHTS WAS GRANTED ON FEBRUARY 15, 2007, AND THEREAFTER, ON MARCH 27, 2007, THE DISTRICT COURT

DISMISSED AS MOOT ALL CLAIMS AGAINST HUNT AND THREE OF SSIS COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY RELATED TO THE COMPANYS AGREEMENTS WITH MILNE AND HUNT CONCERNING THE TERMINATION AND DISPOSITION OF THEIR RIGHTS. IN A RELATED DEVELOPMENT, ON

JANUARY 23, 2007, AND ON AUGUST 22, 2007, SSI INITIATED PROCEEDINGS IN THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (PTO) SEEKING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN POOH TRADEMARK REGISTRATIONS. ON FEBRUARY 22,

2007, THE PTO SUSPENDED THE FIRST PROCEEDING ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE RELIEF SOUGHT IS EFFECTIVELY DUPLICATIVE OF THAT SOUGHT IN THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER, AND ON OCTOBER 2, 2007, THE COMPANY MOVED TO SUSPEND THE SECOND PROCEEDING ON THE SAME

GROUND.

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY.

IN THIS LAWSUIT, FILED ON FEBRUARY 27, 1991, IN THE LOS

ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT, THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT A COMPANY SUBSIDIARY DEFRAUDED IT AND BREACHED A 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH PROPERTIES, BY FAILING TO ACCOUNT FOR AND PAY ROYALTIES ON REVENUES EARNED

FROM THE SALE OF WINNIE THE POOH MOVIES ON VIDEOCASSETTE AND FROM THE EXPLOITATION OF WINNIE THE POOH MERCHANDISING RIGHTS. THE PLAINTIFF SEEKS DAMAGES FOR THE LICENSEES ALLEGED BREACHES AS WELL AS CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAINTIFFS

INTERPRETATION OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE ACTIVITIES. THE PLAINTIFF ALSO SEEKS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT ON THE BASIS OF THE ALLEGED BREACHES. IF EACH OF THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS WERE TO BE CONFIRMED IN A

FINAL JUDGMENT, DAMAGES AS ARGUED BY THE PLAINTIFF COULD TOTAL AS MUCH AS SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE TO THE COMPANY OF ANY FUTURE EXPLOITATION OF THE LICENSED RIGHTS. ON MARCH 29, 2004, THE COURT GRANTED

THE COMPANYS MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF FOR A HOST OF DISCOVERY ABUSES, INCLUDING THE WITHHOLDING, ALTERATION, AND THEFT OF DOCUMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION, AND, ON APRIL 5, 2004, DISMISSED PLAINTIFFS

CASE WITH PREJUDICE. ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2007, THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL AFFIRMED THE DISMISSAL, AND ON NOVEMBER 5, 2007, PLAINTIFF FILED A PETITION SEEKING REVIEW BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF PENDING MATTERS NOTED ABOVE WILL

HAVE ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES,

CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR CO-DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS INVOLVING COPYRIGHT, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE COMPANY

TO SUFFER ANY MATERIAL LIABILITY BY REASON OF SUCH ACTIONS.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES. IN THE

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS DISCUSSION, EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES IS INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME BUT DOES NOT AFFECT SEGMENT REVENUES OR COSTS AND EXPENSES.

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AND MANAGEMENT USES AGGREGATE SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

AS A MEASURE OF THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE OPERATING BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT INFORMATION ABOUT AGGREGATE SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME ASSISTS INVESTORS BY ALLOWING THEM TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS

PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES SEPARATE FROM FACTORS OTHER THAN BUSINESS OPERATIONS THAT AFFECT NET INCOME. AS A RESULT OF THE SPIN-OFF OF THE ABC RADIO BUSINESS IN FISCAL 2007, ABC RADIO IS REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED

(SEE NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION). PREVIOUSLY, THE ABC RADIO BUSINESS WAS INCLUDED IN THE MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT. PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION. THE

FOLLOWING TABLE RECONCILES SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME TO INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES, MINORITY INTERESTS, AND THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE.

REVENUES

MEDIA NETWORKS REVENUES INCREASED 7%, OR $946 MILLION, TO $15.0 BILLION, CONSISTING OF A 12% INCREASE, OR $1.0 BILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND A 1% DECREASE, OR A $62 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING.

INCREASED CABLE NETWORKS REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH OF $601 MILLION FROM CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS, $240 MILLION FROM ADVERTISING REVENUES

AND $167 MILLION FROM OTHER REVENUES. REVENUES FROM CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS ARE GENERALLY DERIVED FROM FEES CHARGED ON A PER-SUBSCRIBER BASIS, AND THE INCREASE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS DRIVEN BY CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES AND SUBSCRIBER GROWTH

PRIMARILY AT ESPN AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, AT THE INTERNATIONAL DISNEY CHANNELS AND THE DOMESTIC DISNEY-ABC CABLE NETWORKS. HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUES REFLECTED

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ADDITION OF NASCAR PROGRAMMING AT ESPN AND ALSO INCREASES AT THE DOMESTIC DISNEY-ABC CABLE NETWORKS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RATES. HIGHER OTHER REVENUES

WERE DRIVEN BY DVD SALES, PRIMARILY

HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL

, AND THE SETTLEMENT OF A DISTRIBUTOR CLAIM.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS INCLUDE ANNUAL LIVE PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS. IN THESE CASES, RECOGNITION OF REVENUES SUBJECT TO THE COMMITMENTS IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE ANNUAL COMMITMENTS ARE SATISFIED, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN

HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

DECREASED BROADCASTING REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN ADVERTISING

REVENUE AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS. THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FEWER HOURS OF SPORTS PROGRAMMING REFLECTING THE ABSENCE OF

MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, THE SUPER BOWL AND THREE COLLEGE BOWL GAMES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PRIMETIME. IN PRIMETIME, HIGHER ADVERTISING RATES AND SOLD INVENTORY WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RATINGS. INCREASED SALES OF ABC STUDIOS

PRODUCTIONS REFLECTED HIGHER INTERNATIONAL AND DVD SALES OF THE HIT DRAMAS

DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES

,

GREYS ANATOMY,

AND

UGLY BETTY.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS COSTS, PRODUCTION COSTS, PARTICIPATION

COSTS, DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING EXPENSES AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, INCREASED 2%, OR $181 MILLION, TO $11.2 BILLION, CONSISTING OF AN 8% INCREASE, OR $462 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 5% DECREASE, OR $281

MILLION, AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COSTS AT ESPN PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS FOR THE ADDITION OF NASCAR AND FOR MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL COMPARED TO SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL

IN THE PRIOR YEAR, AND HIGHER PROGRAMMING AND OTHER COSTS AT THE DOMESTIC DISNEY-ABC CABLE NETWORKS AND INTERNATIONAL DISNEY CHANNELS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COSTS DUE TO THE TRANSITION OF ESPNS MOBILE PHONE OPERATIONS

TO A LICENSING MODEL. THE DECREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DUE TO LOWER SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COSTS OF DISNEY-BRANDED MOBILE PHONE SERVICE, INCLUDING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS SHUTDOWN, AS WELL AS HIGHER PRODUCTION COST

AMORTIZATION DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS.

SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF RIGHTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING THE

NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE (NFL), NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION (NBA), NASCAR, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL (MLB) AND VARIOUS COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL CONFERENCES AND FOOTBALL BOWL GAMES. THE COSTS OF THESE CONTRACTS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN

RECENT YEARS. WE ENTER INTO THESE CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT, OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACTS, REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING DURING THE PROGRAMMING AND AFFILIATE FEES WILL EXCEED THE COSTS OF THE PROGRAMMING. WHILE CONTRACT COSTS

MAY INITIALLY EXCEED INCREMENTAL REVENUES AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OPERATING INCOME, IT IS OUR EXPECTATION THAT THE COMBINED VALUE TO OUR NETWORKS FROM ALL OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL RESULT IN LONG-TERM BENEFITS. THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THESE CONTRACTS ON

THE COMPANYS RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS IS DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

INCREASED 23%, OR $805 MILLION, TO $4.3 BILLION FOR THE YEAR DUE TO INCREASES OF $577 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND $228 MILLION AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT THE CABLE NETWORKS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO GROWTH AT ESPN, THE INTERNATIONAL

DISNEY CHANNELS AND THE DOMESTIC DISNEY-ABC CABLE NETWORKS. THE INCREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DUE TO STRONG SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS, FEWER HOURS OF SPORTS PROGRAMMING AND HIGHER PRIMETIME ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISNEY MOBILE PHONE SERVICE. SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES INCOME FROM EQUITY INVESTEES OF $484 MILLION FOR THE YEAR, COMPARED TO $444 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

ABC RADIO TRANSACTION

ON JUNE 12, 2007, THE

COMPANY COMPLETED THE SPIN-OFF OF ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ABC RADIO HOLDINGS, INC., WHICH WAS THEN MERGED INTO A SUBSIDIARY OF CITADEL BROADCASTING CORPORATION (CITADEL). PRIOR TO THE SPIN-OFF, THE COMPANY CONSOLIDATED ITS ABC RADIO BUSINESS,

CONSISTING OF 22 LARGE-MARKET RADIO STATIONS AND THE ABC RADIO NETWORK BUSINESSES, UNDER ABC RADIO HOLDINGS, INC. THE TRANSACTION DID NOT INCLUDE THE COMPANYS ESPN RADIO OR RADIO DISNEY NETWORK AND STATION BUSINESSES. THE RESULTS OF THE ABC

RADIO BUSINESS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. THE COMPANY NOW INCLUDES THE ESPN RADIO AND RADIO DISNEY

CORPORATION (COMCAST), THE COMPANY SOLD ITS 39.5% INTEREST IN E! ENTERTAINMENT TELEVISION (E!) TO COMCAST (WHICH OWNED THE REMAINDER OF THE INTEREST IN E!) FOR $1.23 BILLION, WHICH RESULTED IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $780 MILLION ($487 MILLION AFTER-TAX)

REPORTED IN GAINS ON SALES OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND BUSINESSES. EQUITY INCOME FROM E! WAS INCLUDED IN MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME THROUGH THE DATE OF THE SALE.

WRITERS GUILD OF AMERICA WORK STOPPAGE

ON NOVEMBER 5, 2007, MEMBERS OF THE WRITERS GUILD OF

AMERICA COMMENCED A WORK STOPPAGE. IF THIS WORK STOPPAGE IS PROLONGED, THE COMPANY MAY BE UNABLE TO PRODUCE OR AIR ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING, WHICH COULD RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE. THE COMPANY IS PURSUING OPPORTUNITIES TO MITIGATE THE

IMPACT OF A SUSTAINED WORK STOPPAGE THROUGH ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMMING AND REDUCTION OF COSTS, HOWEVER, AN EXTENDED WORK STOPPAGE COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR PROFITABILITY.

PARKS AND RESORTS

REVENUES

REVENUES AT PARKS AND RESORTS INCREASED 7%, OR $701 MILLION, TO $10.6 BILLION DUE TO INCREASES OF $483 MILLION AT OUR DOMESTIC RESORTS AND A NET INCREASE OF $218 MILLION AT OUR INTERNATIONAL RESORTS.

DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS

AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND

RESORTS, REVENUE GROWTH WAS DUE TO INCREASES AT WALT DISNEY WORLD AND DISNEYLAND RESORT. AT WALT DISNEY WORLD, REVENUE GROWTH WAS DUE TO INCREASED GUEST SPENDING, THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND VACATION CLUB OWNERSHIP SALES. HIGHER GUEST SPENDING AT WALT

DISNEY WORLD WAS DUE TO INCREASED FOOD, BEVERAGE AND MERCHANDISE SPENDING, HIGHER AVERAGE TICKET PRICES AND A HIGHER AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATE. AT DISNEYLAND RESORT, REVENUE GROWTH WAS DUE TO INCREASED GUEST SPENDING, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER

AVERAGE TICKET PRICES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS

AT OUR INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS, REVENUE GROWTH WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE AT DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT DUE TO LOWER THEME PARK ATTENDANCE. AT DISNEYLAND

RESORT PARIS, REVENUE GROWTH WAS DUE TO THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO, AND HIGHER THEME PARK ATTENDANCE, GUEST SPENDING, AND HOTEL OCCUPANCY. INCREASED GUEST

SPENDING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATE.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF LABOR, DEPRECIATION, COSTS OF MERCHANDISE, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SOLD, MARKETING AND SALES EXPENSE, REPAIRS

AND MAINTENANCE AND ENTERTAINMENT, INCREASED 6%, OR $525 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN COSTS AND EXPENSES WAS DUE TO INCREASES AT WALT DISNEY WORLD AND DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS. THE INCREASE AT WALT DISNEY WORLD WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO VOLUME-RELATED COSTS,

LABOR COST INFLATION, AND NEW GUEST OFFERINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE. THE INCREASE AT DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, AS A RESULT OF

THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO, HIGHER VOLUME-RELATED COSTS, AND LABOR COST INFLATION.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 11%, OR $176 MILLION, TO $1.7 BILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED STRENGTH AT BOTH DOMESTIC RESORTS AND DISNEYLAND

RESORT PARIS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY RESULTS AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT.

STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT

REVENUES

REVENUES FOR THE YEAR WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT

AT $7.5 BILLION COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR AS A DECREASE OF $470 MILLION IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION WAS LARGELY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $234 MILLION IN DOMESTIC HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND AN INCREASE OF $139 MILLION IN MUSIC DISTRIBUTION.

LOWER WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE STRONG BOX-OFFICE PERFORMANCE OF

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD

MANS CHEST

IN THE PRIOR YEAR. OTHER SIGNIFICANT TITLES IN THE PRIOR-YEAR INCLUDED

THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE

, DISNEY/PIXARS

CARS

AND

CHICKEN LITTLE

WHILE THE CURRENT YEAR

INCLUDED

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLDS END

, DISNEY/PIXARS

RATATOUILLE

AND

WILD HOGS

. THE INCREASE IN DOMESTIC HOME ENTERTAINMENT REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER DVD UNIT SALES REFLECTING THE STRONG

PERFORMANCE OF

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MANS CHEST

,

CARS

AND THE

LITTLE MERMAID

PLATINUM RELEASE IN THE CURRENT YEAR. THE REVENUE GROWTH IN MUSIC DISTRIBUTION WAS DRIVEN BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF THE

HANNAH

MONTANA

AND

HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL

SOUNDTRACKS.

COST AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION, DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING EXPENSES, PRODUCT COSTS AND PARTICIPATION COSTS,

DECREASED 8%, OR $510 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION AND WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN MUSIC DISTRIBUTION.

LOWER COSTS IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES, PARTICIPATION COSTS AND FILM COST WRITE-DOWNS. LOWER

DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES WERE DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS AS THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED MORE HIGH PROFILE FILMS THAT HAD EXTENSIVE MARKETING CAMPAIGNS. THE DECREASE IN PARTICIPATION COSTS WERE DRIVEN BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MANS CHEST

AND

THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE

IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED $472 MILLION TO $1.2 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN IMPROVEMENT

IN DOMESTIC HOME ENTERTAINMENT PERFORMANCE IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

REVENUES INCREASED 7%, OR $154 MILLION, TO $2.3 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF $102 MILLION AT MERCHANDISE LICENSING AND $61

MILLION AT DISNEY INTERACTIVE STUDIOS. GROWTH AT MERCHANDISE LICENSING WAS DUE TO HIGHER EARNED ROYALTIES ACROSS MULTIPLE PRODUCT CATEGORIES LED BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

MERCHANDISE. GROWTH AT DISNEY INTERACTIVE STUDIOS WAS DUE TO

THE PERFORMANCE OF CURRENT PERIOD TITLES DRIVEN BY

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLDS END

,

SPECTROBES

AND

MEET THE ROBINSONS

COMPARED TO PRIOR PERIOD TITLES, WHICH INCLUDED

THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA

AND

CHICKEN

LITTLE

. THESE GAINS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER CONTRACTUAL MINIMUM GUARANTEE REVENUES.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF COST OF SALES, SALARIES AND BENEFITS, MARKETING AND VIDEO GAME DEVELOPMENT, INCREASED 7%, OR $113 MILLION,

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE AT DISNEY INTERACTIVE STUDIOS DUE TO HIGHER COST OF SALES, VIDEO GAME DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND MARKETING COSTS AND HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AT MERCHANDISE LICENSING.

OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED

2%, OR $13 MILLION, TO $631 MILLION, DRIVEN BY HIGHER EARNED ROYALTIES AT MERCHANDISE LICENSING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCREASED INVESTMENT IN VIDEO GAME DEVELOPMENT AT DISNEY INTERACTIVE STUDIOS.

SALE OF US WEEKLY

ON OCTOBER 2, 2006, THE

COMPANY SOLD ITS 50% STAKE IN US WEEKLY FOR $300 MILLION, WHICH RESULTED IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $272 MILLION ($170 MILLION AFTER-TAX) REPORTED IN GAINS ON SALES OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND BUSINESSES. EQUITY INCOME FROM US WEEKLY WAS

INCLUDED IN CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME THROUGH THE DATE OF THE SALE.

CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES

CORPORATE

AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES DECREASED 5%, FROM $522 MILLION TO $497 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COSTS INCLUDING THE ABSENCE OF TRANSITION COSTS FROM THE TRANSFER OF CERTAIN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS AND SERVICES

TO THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS THAT WERE INCURRED IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

NET INTEREST EXPENSE WAS RELATIVELY FLAT AS THE INCREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE, PRIMARILY DUE TO

HIGHER EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND, WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME REFLECTING HIGHER AVERAGE CASH BALANCES.

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE INCREASED 2.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 34.5% IN FISCAL 2006 TO 37.2%

IN FISCAL 2007. THE HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCTION IN THE TAX BENEFITS REALIZED FROM AN EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOREIGN SOURCE INCOME. THE EXCLUSION OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SOURCE INCOME WAS REPEALED ON A PHASE-OUT BASIS AS PART OF THE

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF

2004

. NO EXCLUSION IS AVAILABLE FOR TRANSACTIONS ORIGINATING AFTER THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007.

MINORITY INTERESTS

MINORITY INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED FROM $183 MILLION TO $177 MILLION REFLECTING THE IMPACT OF INCREASED LOSSES AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY THE IMPACTS OF INCREASED PROFITS AT ESPN AND DECREASED LOSSES AT DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS. THE MINORITY INTEREST IMPACT IS DETERMINED ON INCOME AFTER ROYALTIES, FINANCING COSTS AND INCOME TAXES.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN COSTS AFFECT RESULTS IN ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS, WITH APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THESE COSTS BEING BORNE BY THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL

BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSES OF $278 MILLION, $462 MILLION AND $314 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2007, 2006, AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN FISCAL 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN

OBLIGATIONS. THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION INCREASED FROM 5.25% TO 6.40%, REFLECTING TRENDS IN PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES AT OUR JUNE 30, 2006 VALUATION DATE. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN

LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

WE EXPECT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS TO DECREASE TO $244 MILLION IN FISCAL 2008

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPROVED FUNDED STATUS OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLANS DRIVEN BY COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. DURING FISCAL 2007, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $416 MILLION TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL PLANS, WHICH INCLUDED DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PENSION PLANS. BASED ON CURRENT ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT IT WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS DURING

FISCAL 2008 UNDER THE FUNDING REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 (PPA). HOWEVER, FINAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR FISCAL 2008 WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON OUR JANUARY 1, 2008 FUNDING ACTUARIAL VALUATION. ADDITIONALLY,

THE COMPANY MAY ALSO CHOOSE TO MAKE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES CONTRIBUTING APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION TO POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND OTHER PENSION PLANS NOT SUBJECT TO THE PPA.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  2006 VS. 2005

MEDIA NETWORKS

REVENUES

MEDIA NETWORKS REVENUES

INCREASED 12%, OR $1.5 BILLION, TO $14.1 BILLION, CONSISTING OF A 10% INCREASE, OR $760 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND A 13% INCREASE, OR $703 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING.

INCREASED CABLE NETWORKS REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH OF $440 MILLION FROM CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS, $216 MILLION IN ADVERTISING REVENUES

AND $104 MILLION FROM OTHER REVENUES. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES FROM CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATIONS IN FISCAL 2006 WAS DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, SUBSCRIBER GROWTH AT ESPN. INCREASED ADVERTISING REVENUE WAS DUE TO

HIGHER RATINGS AND RATES AT ESPN.

THE INCREASE IN BROADCASTING REVENUES WAS DUE TO INCREASED ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE ABC TELEVISION

NETWORK AND INCREASED SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS. THE GROWTH IN ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RATES, STRONG UPFRONT SALES, AND STRENGTH IN RATINGS. HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE ABC

TELEVISION NETWORK ALSO REFLECTED THE AIRING OF THE SUPER BOWL WHICH WE DID NOT HAVE IN FISCAL 2005, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER ADVERTISING REVENUES FROM THE ABSENCE OF MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL (MNF) WHICH MOVED TO ESPN. INCREASED SALES OF ABC STUDIOS

PRODUCTIONS REFLECTED HIGHER INTERNATIONAL SYNDICATION AND DVD SALES OF HIT DRAMAS

LOST, GREYS ANATOMY

, AND

DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES,

AS WELL AS HIGHER THIRD PARTY LICENSE FEES LED BY

SCRUBS,

WHICH COMPLETED ITS FIFTH SEASON

OF NETWORK TELEVISION.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES INCREASED 10%, OR $1.0 BILLION, TO $11.1 BILLION CONSISTING OF A 10% INCREASE, OR $511 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS, AND A 10% INCREASE, OR $496 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS WAS

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COSTS AT ESPN DRIVEN BY HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS FROM THE NEW MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL (MLB) AND NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE (NFL)

LONG-TERM RIGHTS AGREEMENTS AND AN ADDITIONAL NFL GAME. ESPN ALSO INCURRED HIGHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH MOBILE PHONE OPERATIONS, WHICH HAVE NOW TRANSITIONED TO A LICENSING MODEL, AND HIGHER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN

BROADCASTING WAS DUE TO HIGHER PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS, HIGHER COSTS AT THE INTERNET OPERATIONS, AND THE INCREASED NUMBER AND COSTS OF PILOT PRODUCTIONS. THE INCREASE IN PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS REFLECTED COSTS RELATED TO THE SUPER

BOWL AS WELL AS HIGHER PRODUCTION COSTS DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF ABC STUDIO PRODUCTIONS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF COSTS FROM MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2006. THE COST INCREASE AT THE

INTERNET OPERATIONS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LAUNCH OF DISNEY BRANDED MOBILE PHONE SERVICES AS WELL AS COSTS OF OTHER NEW INITIATIVES.

SEGMENT

OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 14%, OR $440 MILLION, TO $3.5 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $243

MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND AN INCREASE OF $197 MILLION AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT THE CABLE NETWORKS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH AT ESPN. THE INCREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DUE TO INCREASED ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE ABC TELEVISION

NETWORK AND INCREASED SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COSTS AT THE INTERNET GROUP, AND THE INCREASED NUMBER AND COSTS OF PILOT PRODUCTIONS. SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES INCOME FROM EQUITY INVESTEES OF $444 MILLION

FOR FISCAL 2006 COMPARED TO $460 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2005.

PARKS AND RESORTS

REVENUES

REVENUES AT PARKS AND RESORTS INCREASED 10%, OR $902 MILLION, TO $9.9 BILLION DUE TO

INCREASES OF $647 MILLION AT OUR DOMESTIC RESORTS AND A NET INCREASE OF $255 MILLION AT OUR INTERNATIONAL RESORTS.

DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS

AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS, INCREASED REVENUES WERE DUE TO INCREASED GUEST SPENDING, THEME PARK ATTENDANCE, AND HOTEL OCCUPANCY, AS WELL AS

HIGHER VACATION CLUB OWNERSHIP SALES. HIGHER GUEST SPENDING WAS DUE TO A HIGHER AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATE, HIGHER AVERAGE TICKET PRICES, AND GREATER MERCHANDISE SPENDING AT BOTH RESORTS. INCREASES IN ATTENDANCE AND HOTEL OCCUPANCY WERE LED BY

THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION AT BOTH DOMESTIC RESORTS, WHICH CONCLUDED AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER 2006.

INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS

INTERNATIONAL REVENUE GROWTH REFLECTED THE FIRST FULL YEAR OF THEME PARK OPERATIONS AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WHEN THE

PARK OPENED IN MID-SEPTEMBER 2005. LOCAL CURRENCY REVENUES AT DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS ALSO INCREASED, HOWEVER THIS INCREASE WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S.

DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO.

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES INCREASED 7%, OR $547 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME-RELATED COSTS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW GUEST OFFERINGS AND ATTRACTIONS AT THE DOMESTIC RESORTS, AND HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AT

HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT REFLECTING A FULL YEAR OF THEME PARK OPERATIONS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF PRE-OPENING COSTS AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT, LOWER COSTS AT DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS DUE TO THE FAVORABLE IMPACT

OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO, AND THE BENEFIT FROM ADJUSTMENTS TO ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED WORKERS COMPENSATION AND GUEST CLAIMS LIABILITIES BASED ON FAVORABLE CLAIMS

EXPERIENCE AT THE DOMESTIC RESORTS.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 30%, OR $356 MILLION, TO $1.5 BILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED STRENGTH AT BOTH DOMESTIC RESORTS, LED BY THE SUCCESS OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION, THE FIRST YEAR OF

OPERATIONS AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT, AND IMPROVEMENTS AT DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS.

STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT

REVENUES

REVENUES DECREASED 1%, OR $58 MILLION, TO

$7.5 BILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF $578 MILLION IN WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $415 MILLION IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION, AND AN INCREASE OF $60 MILLION IN MUSIC DISTRIBUTION.

LOWER WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN UNIT SALES RESULTING FROM A HIGHER NUMBER OF STRONG PERFORMING TITLES IN

THE PRIOR YEAR PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SALES OF TELEVISION DVD BOX-SETS AND REDUCED MARKETING AND TRADE PROGRAMS. SIGNIFICANT FISCAL 2006 TITLES INCLUDED

THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, CINDERELLA

PLATINUM RELEASE, AND

CHICKEN LITTLE,

WHILE FISCAL 2005 TITLES INCLUDED DISNEY/PIXARS

THE INCREDIBLES, NATIONAL TREASURE, ALADDIN

PLATINUM RELEASE, AND

BAMBI

PLATINUM RELEASE.

THE INCREASE IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE STRONG BOX-OFFICE PERFORMANCE OF

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD

MANS CHEST

,

THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND

THE WARDROBE,

AND DISNEY/PIXARS

CARS

COMPARED TO THE FISCAL 2005 TITLES, WHICH INCLUDED

THE INCREDIBLES

AND

NATIONAL TREASURE.

THE

INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUE RESULTING FROM FEWER DOMESTIC MIRAMAX THEATRICAL RELEASES IN FISCAL 2006.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES DECREASED 8%, OR $580 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASES IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION AND HIGHER MUSIC DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES.

THE DECLINE IN COSTS AT WORLDWIDE HOME

ENTERTAINMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED MARKETING EXPENDITURES, LOWER PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION DRIVEN BY DECREASED UNIT SALES, AND LOWER DISTRIBUTION COSTS DRIVEN IN PART BY FEWER RETURNS.

HIGHER COSTS IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN DISTRIBUTION COSTS, PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION AND PARTICIPATION

COSTS. THE INCREASE IN DISTRIBUTION COSTS WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER PROFILE FILMS IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT HAD MORE EXTENSIVE MARKETING CAMPAIGNS TO LAUNCH THE FILMS. HIGHER PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION AND PARTICIPATION COSTS WERE DRIVEN BY THE STRONG

PERFORMANCE OF

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MANS CHEST

AND

THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COSTS RESULTING FROM FEWER DOMESTIC MIRAMAX THEATRICAL

RELEASES IN FISCAL 2006.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED $522 MILLION, TO $729 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION AND WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT.

INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME FOR FISCAL 2006 INCREASED DUE TO A $42 MILLION WRITE-DOWN IN THE PRIOR YEAR OF AN INVESTMENT IN A COMPANY THAT LICENSES

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE INCREASED 3.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 30.8% IN 2005 TO 34.5% IN 2006. THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE PRIOR YEAR

RELATED TO THE REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN

THESE BANK FACILITIES ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS AT LIBOR-BASED RATES PLUS A SPREAD, WHICH DEPENDS ON

THE COMPANYS PUBLIC DEBT RATING AND CAN RANGE FROM 0.175% TO 0.75%. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD NOT BORROWED UNDER THESE BANK FACILITIES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO ISSUE UP TO $800 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT

UNDER THE FACILITY EXPIRING IN 201L, WHICH IF UTILIZED, REDUCES AVAILABLE BORROWING UNDER THIS FACILITY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, $282 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT HAD BEEN ISSUED, OF WHICH $212 MILLION WAS ISSUED UNDER THIS FACILITY.

THE COMPANY MAY USE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS UP TO THE AMOUNT OF ITS ABOVE UNUSED BANK FACILITIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH TERM DEBT

ISSUANCE AND OPERATING CASH FLOW, TO RETIRE OR REFINANCE OTHER BORROWINGS BEFORE OR AS THEY COME DUE.

AS OF THE FILING DATE OF THIS

REPORT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD NOT YET DECLARED A DIVIDEND RELATED TO FISCAL 2007. THE COMPANY PAID A $637 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.31 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007 RELATED TO FISCAL 2006. THE COMPANY PAID A $519 MILLION

DIVIDEND ($0.27 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006 RELATED TO FISCAL 2005; AND PAID A $490 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.24 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005 RELATED TO FISCAL 2004.

DURING FISCAL 2007, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 202 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $6.9 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED

243 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $6.9 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 91 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $2.4 BILLION. ON MAY 1, 2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY INCREASED THE

SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO A TOTAL OF 400 MILLION SHARES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD REMAINING AUTHORIZATION IN PLACE TO REPURCHASE APPROXIMATELY 323 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT

HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH BALANCES, OTHER LIQUID ASSETS,

OPERATING CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING BUSINESSES

AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAN BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL. IN ADDITION TO MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE COMPANYS BORROWING

COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CERTAIN CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE

RATIOS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A2 AND P-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK; AND STANDARD & POORS LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS

FOR THE COMPANY WERE A- AND A-2, RESPECTIVELY, ON CREDITWATCH POSITIVE. ON OCTOBER 4, 2007, STANDARD AND POORS RAISED THE LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS TO A AND A-1, RESPECTIVELY, AND PLACED THE COMPANY ON STABLE OUTLOOK. THE

COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT, RELATING TO INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE COMPANY MET ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. THE COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES ALSO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE CERTAIN

ENTITIES, SUCH AS EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND, FROM ANY REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

PRIOR TO

NOVEMBER 14, 2007, HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS COMMERCIAL TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT CONTAINED SEMI-ANNUAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COVENANTS AND HAD A FINAL MATURITY OF OCTOBER 26, 2015. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE PROSPECT

THAT THE COVENANTS WOULD NOT BE MET AS OF THE SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 MEASUREMENT DATE, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 14, 2007, THE AGREEMENT WAS AMENDED TO REMOVE THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COVENANTS, SHORTEN THE MATURITY OF THE LOAN TO SEPTEMBER 30,

2008 AND DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FROM HK$1 BILLION (APPROXIMATELY $129 MILLION) TO HK$800 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $103 MILLION). THE COMMERCIAL TERM LOAN HAD A BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $284 MILLION AS OF THE EFFECTIVE

DATE OF THE AMENDMENT, AND THE FULL AMOUNT OF THE REVISED REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY BECAME AVAILABLE AS OF THAT DATE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO SUPPORT OPERATING NEEDS IN THE NEAR-TERM, THE COMPANY AGREED TO WAIVE MANAGEMENT FEES FOR FISCAL 2008

AND FISCAL 2009 AND DEFER ROYALTIES FOR THOSE YEARS, WITH PAYMENT OF THE DEFERRED ROYALTIES DEPENDENT UPON THE FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF HONG KONG DISNEYLAND. HONG KONG DISNEYLAND EXPECTS TO NEED ADDITIONAL SOURCES OF FINANCING TO MEET ITS

FINANCIAL AND DEVELOPMENT NEEDS AT AND BEYOND THE MATURITY OF THE COMMERCIAL LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND IS CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE COMPANY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER (THE GOVERNMENT OF THE HONG

KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION) REGARDING FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS TO ASSIST IN MEETING THESE NEEDS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT SUCH FINANCING LIKELY WOULD INCLUDE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT BY THE COMPANY.

EURO DISNEY HAS COVENANTS UNDER ITS DEBT AGREEMENTS THAT LIMIT ITS INVESTMENT AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BEGINNING WITH FISCAL YEAR 2006, EURO DISNEY HAS

ALSO BEEN REQUIRED TO MEET FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COVENANTS THAT NECESSITATED IMPROVEMENTS TO ITS OPERATING MARGIN. AS A RESULT OF REVENUE GROWTH IN EXCESS OF INCREASES IN COSTS AND EXPENSES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2007, EURO DISNEY BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN

COMPLIANCE WITH THESE COVENANTS FOR FISCAL 2007. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE COVENANTS WILL BE MET FOR ANY PARTICULAR MEASUREMENT PERIOD IN THE FUTURE. TO THE EXTENT THAT CONDITIONS ARE SUCH THAT THE COVENANTS APPEAR UNLIKELY TO BE MET,

MANAGEMENT WOULD PURSUE MEASURES TO MEET THE COVENANTS OR WOULD SEEK TO OBTAIN WAIVERS FROM THE DEBT HOLDERS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND

OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS WHICH ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OTHER ITEMS, SUCH AS CERTAIN PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND OTHER EXECUTORY CONTRACTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT ARE REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN THE FOOTNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO ACQUIRE BROADCAST PROGRAMMING AND MAKE CERTAIN MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS FOR THE USE OF PROPERTY UNDER OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND THE FUTURE

PERIODS IN WHICH SUCH OBLIGATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SETTLED IN CASH. IN ADDITION, THE TABLE REFLECTS THE TIMING OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS. ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE PROVIDED IN THE

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE PAYMENTS OR PROVIDE FUNDING IF CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THESE ARRANGEMENTS WILL RESULT IN ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS BEING PAID BY THE COMPANY.

SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS CONTINGENT

COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL GUARANTEES.

LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS

AS DISCLOSED IN NOTES 8 AND 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR CERTAIN LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING

POLICIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT. FOR A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES

DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND COSTS

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS GROSS

REVENUES TO THE ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FOR EACH PRODUCTION. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES DECREASES, AMORTIZATION OF FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED. CONVERSELY, IF ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE

REVENUES INCREASE, FILM AND TELEVISION COST AMORTIZATION MAY BE SLOWED. FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION

SERIES, WE INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER.

WITH RESPECT TO FILMS INTENDED FOR THEATRICAL RELEASE, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES (AND THEREFORE AFFECTING

FUTURE FILM COST AMORTIZATION AND/OR IMPAIRMENT) IS DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. REVENUES DERIVED FROM OTHER MARKETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE DOMESTIC THEATRICAL RELEASE (E.G. THE HOME VIDEO OR INTERNATIONAL THEATRICAL MARKETS) HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN

HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE VARIES PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND DEMAND FOR A PARTICULAR FILM, THE QUALITY OF COMPETING FILMS AT THE TIME OF RELEASE, AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF

MARKETING EFFORT. UPON A FILMS RELEASE AND DETERMINATION OF DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF REVENUES FROM SUCCEEDING WINDOWS AND MARKETS ARE REVISED BASED ON HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND AN ANALYSIS OF CURRENT

MARKET TRENDS. THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR RELEASED FILMS IS THE EXTENT OF HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES ACHIEVED. HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES VARY BASED ON THE VOLUME AND QUALITY OF COMPETING HOME VIDEO

PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE MANNER IN WHICH RETAILERS MARKET AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO TELEVISION SERIES OR OTHER TELEVISION

PRODUCTIONS INTENDED FOR BROADCAST, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES IS THE PROGRAMS RATING. PROGRAM RATINGS, WHICH ARE AN INDICATION OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, DIRECTLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

GENERATE ADVERTISING REVENUES DURING THE AIRING OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, TELEVISION SERIES WITH GREATER MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUES THROUGH THE EVENTUAL SALE OF THE PROGRAM RIGHTS IN THE SYNDICATION,

INTERNATIONAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKETS. ALTERNATIVELY, POOR RATINGS MAY RESULT IN A TELEVISION SERIES CANCELLATION, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE IMMEDIATE WRITE-OFF OF ANY UNAMORTIZED PRODUCTION COSTS.

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS BASED

ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. AMORTIZATION OF THOSE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ASSETS BEING AMORTIZED ON A NUMBER OF AIRINGS BASIS MAY BE ACCELERATED IF WE

REDUCE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS AND SLOWED IF WE INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS. THE NUMBER OF FUTURE AIRINGS OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY THE PROGRAMS RATINGS IN PREVIOUS AIRINGS, EXPECTED ADVERTISING RATES AND

AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMMING. ACCORDINGLY, PLANNED USAGE IS REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND REVISED IF NECESSARY. RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT

PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO ULTIMATE REVENUES (THE PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD) OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. GROSS REVENUES INCLUDE BOTH ADVERTISING REVENUES AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE FEES. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS

RELATED TO EACH SEASON OVER THE TERM OF A MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENT APPROXIMATE EACH SEASONS RIGHTS COST BASED ON THE PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED ANNUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. IF ULTIMATE

REVENUES CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PROJECTIONS, RIGHTS COSTS AMORTIZATION MAY BE ACCELERATED OR SLOWED.

COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION

PRODUCTIONS AND PROGRAMMING RIGHTS FOR OUR BROADCAST BUSINESSES AND CABLE NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING RULES. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM

LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE: EARLY MORNING, DAYTIME, LATE

NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN, AND SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN-OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO

PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM. ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR PROJECTIONS, FILM, TELEVISION AND PROGRAMMING COST

WRITE-DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ITS VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH BUSINESS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THESE

REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES.

WE RECORD REDUCTIONS TO HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND SOFTWARE PRODUCT REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED FUTURE RETURNS OF

MERCHANDISE AND FOR CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND SALES INCENTIVES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL RETURN EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF

RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD, WE MAY RECORD LESS REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS EXCEED THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT. CONVERSELY, IF WE OVERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS FOR A PERIOD, WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN

LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS ARE LESS THAN ESTIMATED.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE

TICKETS ARE USED. FOR NON-EXPIRING, MULTI-DAY TICKETS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER A THREE-YEAR TIME PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE PATTERNS, WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS. A CHANGE IN THESE ESTIMATED USAGE PATTERNS COULD HAVE AN

IMPACT ON THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

THE COMPANYS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE CALCULATED USING A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO

CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY MEASUREMENT. WE EVALUATE THESE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ANNUALLY. OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE

AND EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS RETIREMENT PATTERNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER AND RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE

ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS FOR BENEFITS AS A PRESENT VALUE ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE GUIDELINE FOR SETTING THIS RATE IS A HIGH-QUALITY LONG-TERM CORPORATE BOND RATE. A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE INCREASES THE PRESENT VALUE OF

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES PENSION EXPENSE. WE DECREASED OUR DISCOUNT RATE TO 6.35% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007 FROM 6.40% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006 TO REFLECT MARKET INTEREST RATE CONDITIONS AT OUR JUNE 30, 2007 MEASUREMENT DATE. THIS

DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WILL AFFECT NET PERIODIC PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE IN FISCAL 2008. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE

WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES. A ONE PERCENTAGE

POINT DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCREASE TOTAL NET PERIODIC PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2008 BY $122 MILLION AND WOULD INCREASE THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT

SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 BY $999 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE THESE AMOUNTS BY $74 MILLION AND $849 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATION, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND

EXPECTED RETURNS ON EACH PLAN ASSET CLASS. A LOWER EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE. OUR LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.50% IN BOTH 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT

CHANGE IN THE LONG-TERM RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSET ASSUMPTION WOULD IMPACT FISCAL 2008 ANNUAL PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $51 MILLION.

SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS

SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(SFAS 142)

REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IN ASSESSING THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MARKET VALUES AND PROJECTIONS REGARDING

ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND OTHER FACTORS ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE ASSETS. IF THESE ESTIMATES OR RELATED PROJECTIONS CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR THESE ASSETS.

AS REQUIRED BY SFAS 142, GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ONE REPORTING LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING

SEGMENT. SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING

VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. THE FACTOR MOST SENSITIVE TO

CHANGE WITH RESPECT TO OUR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES IS THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WHICH IS, IN TURN, SENSITIVE TO OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARGINS FOR THESE BUSINESSES. IF ACTUAL REVENUE GROWTH

AND/OR MARGINS ARE LOWER THAN OUR EXPECTATIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER. A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE WAS NOT USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, A BUSINESS WITHIN THE TELEVISION BROADCASTING REPORTING UNIT

WITHIN THE MEDIA NETWORKS OPERATING SEGMENT. TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, WE USED A REVENUE MULTIPLE, AS A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE MAY NOT CONSISTENTLY CAPTURE THE FULL FAIR VALUE OF THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND THERE

IS LITTLE COMPARABLE MARKET DATA AVAILABLE DUE TO THE SCARCITY OF TELEVISION NETWORKS. IF THERE WERE A PUBLICLY DISCLOSED SALE OF A COMPARABLE NETWORK, THIS MAY PROVIDE BETTER MARKET INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF THE ABC TELEVISION

NETWORK AND COULD IMPACT OUR IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT. WE APPLIED WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE

DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY HAS COST AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE

OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT FOR THESE INVESTMENTS, WE CONSIDER THESE FACTORS AS WELL

AS FORECASTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTEES. IF THESE FORECASTS ARE NOT MET, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.

WE COMPLETED OUR

IMPAIRMENT TESTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, WHICH RESULTED IN A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $26 MILLION RELATED TO ESPN RADIO AND RADIO DISNEY FCC LICENSES. DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $32 MILLION

RELATED TO FCC LICENSES PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH ESPN RADIO STATIONS. THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REFLECTED OVERALL MARKET DECLINES IN CERTAIN RADIO MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. DURING FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED EITF D-108 AND RECORDED A

NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $57 MILLION PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH ESPN AND RADIO DISNEY FCC LICENSES.

CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LOSSES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS. THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN

CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND ARE BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL

PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE PROCEEDINGS. SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.

INCOME TAX AUDITS

AS A MATTER OF

COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. OUR RECORDED ESTIMATES OF LIABILITY RELATED TO INCOME TAX AUDITS ARE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH

OUTSIDE TAX AND LEGAL COUNSEL WHERE APPROPRIATE AND ARE BASED UPON THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF PROCEEDINGS (OR NEGOTIATIONS) WITH TAXING AND LEGAL AUTHORITIES IN CONSIDERATION OF APPLICABLE TAX STATUTES AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND PRECEDENTS. THE

OUTCOME OF SUCH PROCEEDINGS AND THE ULTIMATE LIABILITY BORNE BY THE COMPANY MAY DIFFER FROM OUR ESTIMATES BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS DECISION TO SETTLE RATHER THAN LITIGATE A MATTER, RELEVANT LEGAL PRECEDENT RELATED

TO SIMILAR MATTERS AND THE COMPANYS SUCCESS IN SUPPORTING ITS FILING POSITIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES.

STOCK OPTION COMPENSATION EXPENSE

EACH YEAR DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY AWARDS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO A BROAD-BASED GROUP OF MANAGEMENT AND

CREATIVE PERSONNEL (THE ANNUAL GRANT). PRIOR TO THE FISCAL 2006 ANNUAL GRANT, THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED WAS ESTIMATED ON THE GRANT DATE USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. BEGINNING WITH THE FISCAL 2006 ANNUAL GRANT, THE COMPANY

HAS CHANGED TO THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL CONSIDERS CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF FAIR VALUE OPTION PRICING THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED UNDER THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL. SIMILAR TO THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL, THE BINOMIAL

VALUATION MODEL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS VOLATILITY, DIVIDEND YIELD, AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE. HOWEVER, THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE (THE MULTIPLE OF EXERCISE PRICE TO GRANT PRICE AT

WHICH EXERCISES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON AVERAGE) AND THE TERMINATION RATE (THE PROBABILITY OF A VESTED OPTION BEING CANCELLED DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE OPTION HOLDER) IN COMPUTING THE VALUE OF THE OPTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT

THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL SHOULD PRODUCE A FAIR VALUE THAT IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VALUE OF AN EMPLOYEE OPTION.

IN FISCAL YEARS

2007, 2006, AND 2005, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OPTIONS-PRICING MODELS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

COMMENCING WITH THE 2006 ANNUAL GRANT, THE COMPANY UTILIZED THE BINOMIAL VALUATION

MODEL.

(2)

THE COMPANY UTILIZED THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL DURING FISCAL 2005.

(3)

THE EXPECTED TERM ASSUMPTION IS INCLUDED FOR FISCAL 2005 DURING WHICH WE UTILIZED

THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL. UNDER THE BINOMIAL MODEL, EXPECTED TERM IS NOT AN INPUT ASSUMPTION.

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL

FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS NOT ADJUSTED AFTER THE GRANT DATE, CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE THE VALUE AND THEREFORE, THE EXPENSE RELATED TO FUTURE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE GREATEST VARIATION IN

FAIR VALUE IN THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ARE THE ASSUMED VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN EITHER THE ASSUMED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE WILL CAUSE THE BINOMIAL OPTION VALUE TO INCREASE OR DECREASE,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION CONSIDERS BOTH HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE COMPANYS

PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION. IF THE ASSUMED VOLATILITY OF 26% USED BY THE COMPANY DURING 2007 WAS INCREASED OR DECREASED BY FIVE

PERCENTAGE POINTS (I.E. TO 31% OR TO 21%), THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR 2007 STOCK OPTION GRANTS WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED BY 10%.

THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE MAY BE INFLUENCED BY THE COMPANYS FUTURE STOCK PERFORMANCE, STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY, AND EMPLOYEE TURNOVER RATES. IF THE EXERCISE MULTIPLE ASSUMPTION OF 1.38 USED BY THE COMPANY

DURING 2007 WERE INCREASED TO 1.6 OR DECREASED TO 1.2, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE BINOMIAL VALUE OF OUR 2007 STOCK OPTION GRANTS WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY 7% OR DECREASED BY 12%, RESPECTIVELY.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF PIXAR ON MAY 5, 2006, THE COMPANY CONVERTED PREVIOUSLY ISSUED VESTED AND UNVESTED PIXAR STOCK-BASED AWARDS

INTO DISNEY STOCK-BASED AWARDS CONSISTING OF 44 MILLION STOCK OPTIONS AND ONE MILLION RSUS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE AWARDS WAS ESTIMATED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL, AS THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO USE THE BINOMIAL VALUATION

MODEL WAS NOT REASONABLY AVAILABLE. THE METHODOLOGY UTILIZED TO DETERMINE THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL WAS CONSISTENT WITH THAT USED BY THE COMPANY FOR ITS OPTION PRICING MODELS.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

SFAS 159

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 159,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL

LIABILITIES  INCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 115

(SFAS 159). SFAS 159 GIVES THE COMPANY THE IRREVOCABLE OPTION TO CARRY MOST FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN

EARNINGS. SFAS 159 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2009 FISCAL YEAR, ALTHOUGH EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF SFAS 159 ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SFAS 158

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NOS. 87, 88, 106, AND 132(R) (SFAS 158). THIS STATEMENT REQUIRES

RECOGNITION OF THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CHANGES IN THAT FUNDED STATUS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR. SFAS 158 ALSO REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF THE FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN AS OF THE DATE OF THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 158 IN FISCAL YEAR 2007. SEE NOTE

9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 158. THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET ADOPTED THE MEASUREMENT PROVISIONS WHICH ARE NOT EFFECTIVE UNTIL FISCAL YEAR 2009.

SFAS 157

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE

FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

(SFAS 157). SFAS 157 PROVIDES A COMMON DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE AND ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK TO MAKE THE MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE IN

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES MORE CONSISTENT AND COMPARABLE. SFAS 157 ALSO REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE IS USED TO MEASURE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS

USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE, AND THE EFFECT OF FAIR VALUE MEASURES ON EARNINGS. SFAS 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2009 FISCAL YEAR, ALTHOUGH EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF SFAS

157 ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SAB 108

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE SEC STAFF ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108,

CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(SAB 108). SAB 108 WAS ISSUED IN

ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE SURROUNDING HOW PUBLIC COMPANIES QUANTIFY FINANCIAL STATEMENT MISSTATEMENTS. SAB 108 REQUIRES THAT REGISTRANTS QUANTIFY ERRORS USING BOTH A BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME STATEMENT APPROACH AND EVALUATE WHETHER

EITHER APPROACH RESULTS IN A MISSTATED AMOUNT THAT, WHEN ALL RELEVANT QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED, IS MATERIAL. THE COMPANY ADOPTED SAB 108 AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007, AND THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FIN 48

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

(FIN 48). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING A MINIMUM PROBABILITY THRESHOLD THAT A TAX POSITION

MUST

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MEET BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED IN FIN 48 AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE

SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF

BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. FIN 48 MUST BE APPLIED TO ALL EXISTING TAX POSITIONS UPON INITIAL ADOPTION. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF APPLYING FIN 48 AT ADOPTION IS TO BE REPORTED AS AN

ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR OF ADOPTION. FIN 48 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2008 FISCAL YEAR AND WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS IN FISCAL YEAR 2008.

EITF D-108

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE

EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUED TOPIC NO. D-108,

USE OF THE RESIDUAL METHOD TO VALUE ACQUIRED ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL

(EITF D-108). EITF D-108 REQUIRES THAT A DIRECT VALUE METHOD BE USED TO VALUE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS COMPLETED AFTER SEPTEMBER 29, 2004. EITF D-108 ALSO REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT TEST USING A DIRECT VALUE METHOD ON ALL INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY VALUED USING THE RESIDUAL METHOD. ANY

IMPAIRMENTS ARISING FROM THE INITIAL APPLICATION OF A DIRECT VALUE METHOD ARE REPORTED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE. FOR RADIO STATION ACQUISITIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF CAPITAL CITIES/ABC, INC. IN 1996, THE COMPANY APPLIED

THE RESIDUAL VALUE METHOD TO VALUE THE ACQUIRED FCC LICENSES. THE COMPANY ADOPTED EITF D-108 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 1, 2005 AND RECORDED A NON-CASH, $57 MILLION PRE-TAX CHARGE ($36 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

ACCOUNTING CHANGE.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE WRITTEN OR ORAL STATEMENTS THAT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING,

INCLUDING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND IN REPORTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. SUCH STATEMENTS MAY, FOR EXAMPLE, EXPRESS EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE ACTIONS THAT WE MAY

TAKE, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING OR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, OR ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL INCLUDING CHANGES IN DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE MADE ON THE BASIS OF MANAGEMENTS VIEWS AND ASSUMPTIONS AS OF THE

TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE THESE STATEMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WILL NECESSARILY COME TO PASS. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING THESE EXPECTATIONS ARE SET FORTH UNDER

ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO

THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, AND CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AND THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE

PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM

PERCENTAGES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW IN

ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF ITS EXISTING

FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS, AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED,

TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE PRINCIPAL FOREIGN CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN, AND CANADIAN

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES GENERALLY FOR PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR

EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES.

IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE

TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY OTHER HEDGING TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

VALUE AT RISK (VAR)

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VAR

MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES WERE MADE ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95%

CONFIDENCE LEVEL. VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED IN A VAR COMPUTATION. THE COMPANYS COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES, AND EQUITY PRICES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE

TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS WERE DETERMINED BY OBSERVING INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY, AND EQUITY MARKET CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING QUARTER FOR THE CALCULATION OF VAR AMOUNTS AT FISCAL 2007 YEAR END. THE MODEL INCLUDES ALL OF THE

COMPANYS DEBT AS WELL AS ALL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES,

WHICH CERTAIN OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT

PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WILL BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS.

VAR ON A COMBINED BASIS INCREASED TO $33 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 FROM $21 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VOLATILITY AND A HIGHER MARKET VALUE OF

CURRENCY-SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE, CALCULATED USING THE VAR MODEL, IS AS FOLLOWS

(UNAUDITED, IN MILLIONS).

THE VAR FOR EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND IS IMMATERIAL AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007. IN

CALCULATING THE VAR IT WAS DETERMINED THAT CREDIT RISKS ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF EURO DISNEYS DEBT RATHER THAN INTEREST RATE RISKS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE EXCLUDED EURO DISNEYS BORROWINGS FROM THE ABOVE VAR

CALCULATION.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

(I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT

MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY

DETERIORATE.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL

FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON OUR EVALUATION UNDER THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK,

MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS

EFFECTIVE AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS

PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH

OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE

ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED

AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE

AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE

ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS. ALSO, DURING THE YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 1, 2005, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT VALUES ITS FCC LICENSES.

A

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT

THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS

INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF

CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AFTER ELIMINATION OF

INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS. IN DECEMBER 1999, DVD FINANCING, INC. (DFI), A SUBSIDIARY OF DISNEY VACATION DEVELOPMENT, INC. AND AN INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, COMPLETED A RECEIVABLE SALE TRANSACTION THAT ESTABLISHED A FACILITY

THAT PERMITS DFI TO SELL RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE SALE OF VACATION CLUB MEMBERSHIPS ON A PERIODIC BASIS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS FACILITY, DFI PREPARES SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH ITS SEPARATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE ALSO

CONSOLIDATED IN THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

SFAS 159

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 159,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES  INCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 115

(SFAS 159). SFAS 159 GIVES THE COMPANY THE IRREVOCABLE OPTION TO CARRY MOST FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT

FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. SFAS 159 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2009 FISCAL YEAR, ALTHOUGH EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF SFAS 159 ON ITS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

SFAS 158

IN SEPTEMBER

2006, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NOS. 87, 88, 106, AND 132(R) (SFAS 158).

THIS STATEMENT REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CHANGES IN THAT FUNDED STATUS TO BE RECOGNIZED

IN COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR. SFAS 158 ALSO REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF THE FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN AS OF THE DATE OF THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 158 IN

FISCAL YEAR 2007. SEE NOTE 9 FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THE RECOGNITION PROVISION OF SFAS 158. THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET ADOPTED THE MEASUREMENT PROVISIONS WHICH ARE NOT EFFECTIVE UNTIL FISCAL YEAR 2009.

72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SFAS 157

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

(SFAS 157). SFAS 157 PROVIDES A COMMON DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE AND ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK TO MAKE THE

MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE IN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES MORE CONSISTENT AND COMPARABLE. SFAS 157 ALSO REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE IS USED TO MEASURE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES,

THE METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE, AND THE EFFECT OF FAIR VALUE MEASURES ON EARNINGS. SFAS 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2009 FISCAL YEAR, ALTHOUGH EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING

THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF SFAS 157 ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SAB 108

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE SEC STAFF ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108,

CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(SAB 108).

SAB 108 WAS ISSUED IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE SURROUNDING HOW PUBLIC COMPANIES QUANTIFY FINANCIAL STATEMENT MISSTATEMENTS. SAB 108 REQUIRES THAT REGISTRANTS QUANTIFY ERRORS USING BOTH A BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME STATEMENT

APPROACH AND EVALUATE WHETHER EITHER APPROACH RESULTS IN A MISSTATED AMOUNT THAT, WHEN ALL RELEVANT QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED, IS MATERIAL. THE COMPANY ADOPTED SAB 108 AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007, AND THE ADOPTION DID NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FIN 48

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

(FIN 48). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING A MINIMUM PROBABILITY THRESHOLD THAT A TAX POSITION MUST MEET BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED IN FIN 48 AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO

BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT

OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. FIN 48 MUST BE APPLIED TO ALL EXISTING TAX POSITIONS UPON INITIAL ADOPTION. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF APPLYING FIN 48 AT ADOPTION IS TO BE REPORTED AS AN

ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR OF ADOPTION. FIN 48 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2008 FISCAL YEAR AND WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS IN FISCAL YEAR 2008.

EITF D-108

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE

EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUED TOPIC NO. D-108,

USE OF THE RESIDUAL METHOD TO VALUE ACQUIRED ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL

(EITF D-108). EITF D-108 REQUIRES THAT A DIRECT VALUE METHOD BE USED TO VALUE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS COMPLETED AFTER SEPTEMBER 29, 2004. EITF D-108 ALSO REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT TEST USING A DIRECT VALUE METHOD ON ALL INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY VALUED USING THE RESIDUAL METHOD. ANY

IMPAIRMENTS ARISING FROM THE INITIAL APPLICATION OF A DIRECT VALUE METHOD ARE REPORTED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE. FOR RADIO STATION ACQUISITIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF CAPITAL CITIES/ABC, INC. IN 1996, THE COMPANY APPLIED

THE RESIDUAL VALUE METHOD TO VALUE THE ACQUIRED FCC LICENSES. THE COMPANY ADOPTED EITF D-108 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 1, 2005 AND RECORDED A NON-CASH $57 MILLION PRE-TAX CHARGE ($36 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

ACCOUNTING CHANGE.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE FISCAL 2006 AND FISCAL 2005 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO CONFORM TO THE FISCAL 2007 PRESENTATION.

AS A RESULT OF THE SPIN-OFF OF THE ABC RADIO BUSINESS IN FISCAL 2007, ABC RADIO IS REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED (SEE NOTE 3 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION). PREVIOUSLY, THE ABC RADIO BUSINESS

WAS INCLUDED IN THE MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT. PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT PRESENTATION.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FOOTNOTES THERETO. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

INVENTORIES

CARRYING AMOUNTS

OF MERCHANDISE, MATERIALS, AND SUPPLIES INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A MOVING AVERAGE COST BASIS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS INCLUDE CAPITALIZABLE PRODUCTION COSTS, PRODUCTION OVERHEAD, INTEREST,

DEVELOPMENT COSTS, AND ACQUIRED PRODUCTION COSTS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR FAIR VALUE. ACQUIRED PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR THE COMPANYS TELEVISION AND CABLE/SATELLITE NETWORKS ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF

COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ACQUIRED TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE RECORDED WHEN THE LICENSE PERIOD BEGINS AND THE PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE FOR USE. MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, AND GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND PARTICIPATION COSTS ARE EXPENSED BASED ON THE RATIO OF

THE CURRENT PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FROM ALL SOURCES ON AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION BASIS. ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS INCLUDES REVENUE THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS

OF THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION NETWORK SERIES, WE INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY OF THE MOST

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED MOVIES, SERIES

AND OTHER PROGRAMS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED BASED UPON THE RATIO OF

THE CURRENT PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO ULTIMATE REVENUES (THE PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD) OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS INCLUDE BOTH ADVERTISING

REVENUES AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE FEES. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON OVER THE TERM OF A MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENT APPROXIMATE EACH SEASONS RIGHTS COST BASED ON THE PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD, WE

EXPENSE THE RELATED ANNUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN-OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM.

THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF NETWORK TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS IS REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF

DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE EARLY MORNING, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN, AND SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ARE REVIEWED ON AN

AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL.

POST-IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONAL STAGE, SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING. CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OCCURS ONLY AFTER THE PRELIMINARY-PROJECT STAGE IS COMPLETE, MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZES THE PROJECT, AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PROJECT

WILL BE COMPLETED AND THE SOFTWARE WILL BE USED FOR THE FUNCTION INTENDED. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS, NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION, TOTALED $555 MILLION AND $491 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST AT FISCAL YEAR END FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING FCC LICENSES AND

TRADEMARKS. AS REQUIRED BY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(SFAS 142), GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ONE LEVEL BELOW OUR OPERATING

SEGMENTS.

TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING

UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE

CARRYING VALUE OF ITS GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE, EXCEPT FOR THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, A BUSINESS WITHIN THE MEDIA NETWORKS OPERATING SEGMENT, FOR WHICH WE USED A REVENUE MULTIPLE. WE USED A REVENUE MULTIPLE AS A

PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE MAY NOT CONSISTENTLY CAPTURE THE FULL FAIR VALUE OF THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, AND THERE IS LITTLE COMPARABLE MARKET DATA AVAILABLE DUE TO THE SCARCITY OF TELEVISION NETWORKS. WE APPLIED WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST

APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF

AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.

WE COMPLETED OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, WHICH RESULTED IN A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $26 MILLION RELATED TO ESPN RADIO

AND RADIO DISNEY FCC LICENSES. DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $32 MILLION RELATED TO FCC LICENSES PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH ESPN RADIO STATIONS. THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REFLECTED OVERALL MARKET DECLINES IN

CERTAIN RADIO MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. DURING FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED EITF D-108 AND RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $57 MILLION PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH ESPN AND RADIO DISNEY FCC LICENSES.

AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PRINCIPALLY COPYRIGHTS, ARE GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER PERIODS OF UP TO 31 YEARS.

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF

BUSINESS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY

SWAP AGREEMENTS; FORWARD, OPTION AND SWAPTION CONTRACTS AND INTEREST RATE CAPS.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL

RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR UNDERTAKING VARIOUS HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DERIVATIVES INTO WHICH THE COMPANY ENTERS: HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE

EXPOSURE AND HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE. HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED ASSET, LIABILITY, OR A FIRM COMMITMENT. HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE A

FORECASTED TRANSACTION (E.G. FORECASTED REVENUE) OR THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED, RELATED TO A RECOGNIZED LIABILITY OR ASSET (E.G. FLOATING RATE DEBT).

76

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES AND ASSIGNS THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS,

SPECIFIC ASSETS OR SPECIFIC LIABILITIES. WHEN HEDGED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE SOLD OR EXTINGUISHED OR THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED HEDGING

OPTION PREMIUMS AND UNREALIZED GAINS ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS OTHER ASSETS. UNREALIZED LOSSES ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID UNDER THE

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS AS INTEREST RATES AND EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIVES OF THE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE TERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE SWAP AGREEMENTS, PRIOR TO

THEIR ORIGINAL MATURITY, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THESE CONTRACTS ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET CERTAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURES OF THE COMPANY AND ARE

CARRIED AT MARKET VALUE WITH ANY CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (SEE NOTES 7 AND 13).

EARNINGS PER SHARE

THE COMPANY PRESENTS BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AMOUNTS. BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EPS IS

BASED UPON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR WHICH IS CALCULATED USING THE TREASURY-STOCK METHOD FOR EQUITY-BASED AWARDS AND ASSUMES CONVERSION OF THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE SENIOR

NOTES (SEE NOTE 7). COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION IN PERIODS IN WHICH THEY HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT. STOCK OPTIONS FOR WHICH THE EXERCISE PRICE EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OVER THE PERIOD ARE ANTI-DILUTIVE AND,

ACCORDINGLY, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION.

COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR CALCULATING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IS AS FOLLOWS.

SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

ACQUISITION OF PIXAR

ON MAY 5, 2006 (THE CLOSING DATE), THE COMPANY COMPLETED AN ALL STOCK ACQUISITION OF PIXAR, A DIGITAL ANIMATION STUDIO (THE ACQUISITION). DISNEY BELIEVES THAT THE CREATION OF HIGH QUALITY FEATURE ANIMATION IS A

KEY DRIVER OF SUCCESS ACROSS MANY OF ITS BUSINESSES AND PROVIDES CONTENT USEFUL ACROSS A VARIETY OF TRADITIONAL AND NEW PLATFORMS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE ACQUISITION OF PIXAR IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC PRIORITIES OF

CREATING THE FINEST CONTENT, EMBRACING LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES, AND STRENGTHENING ITS GLOBAL PRESENCE. THE RESULTS OF PIXARS OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SINCE THE CLOSING DATE.

TO PURCHASE PIXAR, DISNEY EXCHANGED 2.3 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR EACH SHARE OF PIXAR COMMON STOCK, RESULTING IN THE ISSUANCE OF

279 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK, AND CONVERTED PREVIOUSLY ISSUED VESTED AND UNVESTED PIXAR EQUITY-BASED AWARDS INTO APPROXIMATELY 45 MILLION DISNEY EQUITY-BASED AWARDS.

THE ACQUISITION PURCHASE PRICE WAS $7.5 BILLION ($6.4 BILLION, NET OF PIXARS CASH AND INVESTMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION). THE VALUE OF THE

STOCK ISSUED WAS CALCULATED BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK USING THE AVERAGE STOCK PRICE FOR THE FIVE-DAY PERIOD BEGINNING TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ACQUISITION ANNOUNCEMENT DATE ON JANUARY 24, 2006. THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE VESTED EQUITY-BASED AWARDS ISSUED AT THE CLOSING DATE WAS ESTIMATED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL, AS THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO USE A BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL WAS NOT REASONABLY AVAILABLE.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-CASH, NON-TAXABLE GAIN FROM THE DEEMED TERMINATION OF THE EXISTING PIXAR DISTRIBUTION

AGREEMENT. UNDER OUR PREVIOUSLY EXISTING DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH PIXAR, THE COMPANY EARNED A DISTRIBUTION FEE THAT, BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RATES AT THE CLOSING DATE, WAS FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH EITF 04-1,

ACCOUNTING FOR

PRE-EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO A BUSINESS COMBINATION

(EITF 04-1), THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A $48 MILLION GAIN, REPRESENTING THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE FAVORABLE PORTION OF THE DISTRIBUTION FEE OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE

DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ABANDONED THE PIXAR SEQUEL PROJECTS COMMENCED BY THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION AND RECORDED A PRE-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TOTALING $26 MILLION, WHICH REPRESENTS THE COSTS OF THESE PROJECTS

INCURRED THROUGH THE ABANDONMENT DATE. THESE TWO ITEMS ARE CLASSIFIED IN RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT (CHARGES) AND OTHER CREDITS, NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

THE COMPANY ALLOCATED THE PURCHASE PRICE TO THE TANGIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES,

WHICH WERE DETERMINED PRIMARILY THROUGH THIRD-PARTY APPRAISALS. THE GOODWILL THAT AROSE FROM THE ACQUISITION REFLECTED THE VALUE TO DISNEY FROM.

ABC RADIO TRANSACTION

ON JUNE 12, 2007, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SPIN-OFF OF ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ABC RADIO HOLDINGS, INC., AND ITS MERGER INTO A SUBSIDIARY OF CITADEL BROADCASTING CORPORATION (CITADEL). PRIOR TO THE

OF CITADEL COMMON STOCK IN EXCHANGE FOR EACH SHARE OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK HELD AS OF JUNE 6, 2007. APPROXIMATELY 151.7 MILLION SHARES OF CITADEL COMMON STOCK WERE ISSUED TO COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS IN THE MERGER. AS PART OF THE TRANSACTION,

THE COMPANY RETAINED $1.35 BILLION OF CASH, REPRESENTING THE PROCEEDS FROM DEBT RAISED BY ABC RADIO HOLDINGS, INC. PRIOR TO THE SPIN-OFF. THIS DEBT AND THE ASSETS AND OTHER LIABILITIES OF THE ABC RADIO BUSINESS WERE REMOVED FROM THE COMPANYS

BALANCE SHEET AS A DISTRIBUTION AT BOOK VALUE. CONSEQUENTLY, THERE WAS NO GAIN OR LOSS RECORDED AND THE NEGATIVE NET BOOK VALUE OF $132 MILLION WAS CREDITED TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

IN 2007 THE COMPANY DERIVED TAX BENEFITS OF $37 MILLION FROM AN EXCLUSION PROVIDED UNDER U.S.

INCOME TAX LAWS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO FOREIGN TRADING GROSS RECEIPTS (FTGRS). THIS EXCLUSION WAS REPEALED AS PART OF THE

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

(THE ACT), WHICH WAS

ENACTED ON OCTOBER 22, 2004. THE ACT PROVIDES FOR A PHASE-OUT SUCH THAT THE EXCLUSION FOR THE COMPANYS OTHERWISE QUALIFYING FTGRS GENERATED IN FISCAL 2005, 2006 AND 2007 ARE LIMITED TO APPROXIMATELY 85%, 65% AND 15%, RESPECTIVELY. NO

EXCLUSION IS AVAILABLE FOR TRANSACTIONS ORIGINATING AFTER THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007.

THE ACT ALSO PROVIDED FOR A ONE-TIME TAX

DEDUCTION OF 85% OF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WERE REPATRIATED IN FISCAL 2005. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED FOREIGN EARNINGS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS DEDUCTION AND RECORDED A TAX BENEFIT OF $32 MILLION AS A RESULT

OF THE REVERSAL OF DEFERRED TAXES PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED ON THESE EARNINGS.

THE ACT MADE A NUMBER OF OTHER CHANGES TO THE INCOME TAX LAWS

INCLUDING THE CREATION OF A NEW DEDUCTION RELATING TO QUALIFYING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES WHICH WILL AFFECT THE COMPANY IN THE CURRENT AND FUTURE YEARS. THE DEDUCTION EQUALS THREE PERCENT OF QUALIFYING NET INCOME FOR FISCAL 2006 AND 2007, SIX

PERCENT FOR FISCAL 2008 THROUGH 2010, AND NINE PERCENT FOR FISCAL 2011 AND THEREAFTER. OUR TAX PROVISIONS FOR FISCAL 2007 AND FISCAL 2006 REFLECT BENEFITS OF $41 MILLION AND $25 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING FROM THIS DEDUCTION.

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED

ASSESSMENTS. AT THE CURRENT TIME, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE CONTINUES TO EXAMINE THE COMPANYS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2001 THROUGH 2004. DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY SETTLED CERTAIN STATE INCOME TAX DISPUTES AND RELEASED $40

MILLION IN RELATED TAX RESERVES THAT WERE NO LONGER REQUIRED. DURING FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY REACHED SETTLEMENTS WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE REGARDING ALL ASSESSMENTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO ITS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 1996 THROUGH

2000, AND A SETTLEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD REGARDING ASSESSMENTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO ITS STATE TAX RETURNS FOR 1994 THROUGH 2003. THESE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENTS RESULTED IN THE COMPANY RELEASING $102 MILLION IN TAX RESERVES

WHICH WERE NO LONGER REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO THE SETTLED MATTERS.

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

(FIN 48). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING A MINIMUM PROBABILITY THRESHOLD THAT A TAX POSITION MUST MEET BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE

MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED IN FIN 48 AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL

MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. FIN 48 MUST BE APPLIED TO ALL EXISTING TAX POSITIONS UPON

INITIAL ADOPTION. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF APPLYING FIN 48 AT ADOPTION IS TO BE REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR OF ADOPTION. FIN 48 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2008 FISCAL YEAR AND WILL RESULT IN A

REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS IN FISCAL YEAR 2008.

IN FISCAL YEARS 2007, 2006 AND 2005, INCOME

TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE ALLOCATED TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AMOUNTED TO $123 MILLION, $106 MILLION AND $64 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PROGRAMS

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS PENSION PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS COVERING MOST OF ITS EMPLOYEES NOT COVERED BY UNION OR INDUSTRY-WIDE PLANS. EMPLOYEES HIRED AFTER JANUARY 1, 1994 AND ABC EMPLOYEES GENERALLY HIRED AFTER JANUARY 1, 1987 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL

BENEFITS. WITH RESPECT TO ITS QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, THE COMPANYS POLICY IS TO FUND, AT A MINIMUM, THE AMOUNT NECESSARY ON AN ACTUARIAL BASIS TO PROVIDE FOR BENEFITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EMPLOYEE

RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974. PENSION BENEFITS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND/OR COMPENSATION.

ON

SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE RECOGNITION AND DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 158. SFAS 158 REQUIRES THE RECOGNITION OF THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS AN ASSET OR

LIABILITY IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CHANGES IN THAT FUNDED STATUS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR. THE INCREMENTAL EFFECT OF APPLYING SFAS 158 ON INDIVIDUAL LINE ITEMS TO OUR BALANCE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PLAN FUNDED STATUS

AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD PENSION PLANS THAT WERE UNDERFUNDED, HAVING ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS EXCEEDING THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS. THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION, ACCUMULATED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION AND AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS FOR PENSION PLANS WITH ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS IN EXCESS OF PLAN ASSETS WERE $323 MILLION, $283 MILLION AND $2 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND $2.1 BILLION, $1.9

BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANYS TOTAL ACCUMULATED PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT

SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 WERE $4.8 BILLION AND $4.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH 96.2% AND 96.1%, RESPECTIVELY, WERE VESTED.

THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS FOR POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS WITH ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS IN EXCESS OF PLAN ASSETS WERE $1.0

BILLION AND $372 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND $936 MILLION AND $317 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006.

PLAN

ASSETS

THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE MANAGED ON A COMMINGLED BASIS IN A THIRD PARTY MASTER TRUST. THE

INVESTMENT POLICY AND ALLOCATION OF THE ASSETS IN THE MASTER TRUST WERE APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE, WHICH HAS OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMPANYS RETIREMENT PLANS. THE INVESTMENT POLICY RANGES

THE

CASH ALLOCATION EXCEEDED THE POLICY RANGE LIMIT ON JUNE 30, 2006, DUE TO A $314 MILLION EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION INTO THE PLANS IN JUNE 2006, WHICH WAS INVESTED OVER TIME.

PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS

DURING FISCAL 2007, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $390 MILLION AND $26 MILLION TO ITS

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH INCLUDED DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PENSION PLANS. BASED ON CURRENT ACTUARIAL PROJECTIONS, THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE

PENSION PLANS WILL BE SUFFICIENT SO THAT THE COMPANY WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO MAKE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS DURING FISCAL 2008 UNDER THE FUNDING REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 (PPA). HOWEVER, FINAL FUNDING REQUIREMENTS

FOR FISCAL 2008 WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON OUR JANUARY 1, 2008 FUNDING ACTUARIAL VALUATION. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY MAY ALSO CHOOSE TO MAKE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES CONTRIBUTING

APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION TO POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL AND OTHER PENSION PLANS NOT SUBJECT TO THE PPA.

ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT

PAYMENTS ARE NET OF EXPECTED MEDICARE SUBSIDY RECEIPTS OF $53 MILLION OVER THE NEXT TEN FISCAL YEARS.

ASSUMPTIONS

CERTAIN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS THE DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE,

HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST AS WELL AS THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AMOUNTS.

DISCOUNT RATE

 THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE FOR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS REFLECTS THE MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY

CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

 THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM RETURNS ON AN

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTING OF A MIXTURE OF EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS. WHEN DETERMINING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON THE ASSET CLASSES (BOTH HISTORICAL

AND FORECASTED) IN WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE PENSION FUNDS TO BE INVESTED. THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN BY ASSET CLASS WERE CONSIDERED IN SETTING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION.

EQUITY SECURITIES

8%  10%

DEBT SECURITIES

4%    7%

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS

8%  20%

HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE

 THE COMPANY REVIEWS EXTERNAL DATA AND ITS OWN HISTORICAL

TRENDS FOR HEALTHCARE COSTS TO DETERMINE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATES FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS. FOR THE 2007 ACTUARIAL VALUATION, WE ASSUMED A 9.0% ANNUAL RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE CLAIMS

WITH THE RATE DECREASING IN EVEN INCREMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS UNTIL REACHING 5.0%.

A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT (PPT) CHANGE IN THE KEY

ASSUMPTIONS WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS ON THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND ON COST FOR FISCAL 2008.

MULTI-EMPLOYER PLANS

THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN VARIOUS MULTI-EMPLOYER PENSION PLANS UNDER UNION AND INDUSTRY-WIDE AGREEMENTS. IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PLANS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY EXPENSED AS INCURRED, WERE $54

MILLION, $51 MILLION AND $37 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLANS THAT ALLOW ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO ALLOCATE UP TO 20% OF THEIR SALARY THROUGH PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS DEPENDING ON

THE PLAN IN WHICH THE EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATES. THE COMPANY MATCHES 50% OF THE EMPLOYEES PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS, UP TO PLAN LIMITS. IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, THE COSTS OF THESE PLANS WERE $42 MILLION, $39 MILLION AND $35 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

10.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

AS OF THE FILING DATE OF THIS REPORT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD

NOT YET DECLARED A DIVIDEND RELATED TO FISCAL 2007. THE COMPANY PAID A $637 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.31 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007 RELATED TO FISCAL 2006. THE COMPANY PAID A $519 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.27 PER SHARE) DURING THE

SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006 RELATED TO FISCAL 2005; AND PAID A $490 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.24 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005 RELATED TO FISCAL 2004.

DURING FISCAL 2007, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 202 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $6.9 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 243 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $6.9 BILLION.

DURING FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 91 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $2.4 BILLION. ON MAY 1, 2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY INCREASED THE SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO A TOTAL OF 400 MILLION

SHARES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD REMAINING AUTHORIZATION IN PLACE TO REPURCHASE APPROXIMATELY 323 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE.

THE PAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $26 MILLION.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS 1.0 BILLION SHARES OF INTERNET GROUP STOCK AT $.01 PAR VALUE AUTHORIZED. NO SHARES ARE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING.

11.

EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

UNDER VARIOUS PLANS, THE COMPANY MAY GRANT STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER

EQUITY-BASED AWARDS TO EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT, AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL. THE COMPANYS APPROACH TO LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION CONTEMPLATES AWARDS OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS).

STOCK OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY GRANTED AT EXERCISE PRICES EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING THE MARKET PRICE AT THE DATE OF GRANT. EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2003, OPTIONS

BECAME EXERCISABLE RATABLY OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE GRANT DATE, WHILE OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 2003 GENERALLY VEST RATABLY OVER FIVE YEARS. EFFECTIVE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005, OPTIONS GRANTED GENERALLY EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS AFTER

THE GRANT DATE, WHILE OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005 GENERALLY EXPIRE TEN YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT. AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OPTIONS CAN OCCASIONALLY EXTEND

UP TO 15 YEARS AFTER DATE OF GRANT. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GENERALLY VEST 50% ON EACH OF THE SECOND AND FOURTH ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT DATE. CERTAIN RSUS AWARDED TO SENIOR EXECUTIVES VEST BASED UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS.

STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS ARE FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES WHO TERMINATE PRIOR TO VESTING. SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE OPTION AND RSU GRANTS AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 TOTALED 54 MILLION. THE COMPANY SATISFIES STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF RSUS WITH

NEWLY ISSUED SHARES.

EACH YEAR, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY AWARDS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO A BROAD-BASED

GROUP OF MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL (THE ANNUAL GRANT). PRIOR TO THE FISCAL 2006 ANNUAL GRANT, THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED WAS ESTIMATED ON THE GRANT DATE USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. BEGINNING WITH THE FISCAL 2006

ANNUAL GRANT, THE COMPANY HAS CHANGED TO THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL CONSIDERS CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF FAIR VALUE OPTION PRICING THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED UNDER THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL. SIMILAR TO THE BLACK-SCHOLES

MODEL, THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS VOLATILITY, DIVIDEND YIELD, AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE. HOWEVER, THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED

98

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXERCISE MULTIPLE (THE MULTIPLE OF EXERCISE PRICE TO GRANT PRICE AT WHICH EXERCISES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON AVERAGE) AND THE TERMINATION RATE (THE

PROBABILITY OF A VESTED OPTION BEING CANCELLED DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE OPTION HOLDER) IN COMPUTING THE VALUE OF THE OPTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL SHOULD PRODUCE A FAIR VALUE THAT IS MORE

REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VALUE OF AN EMPLOYEE OPTION.

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED OPTION TERM ASSUMPTION USED BY THE COMPANY FOR GRANTS

DURING FISCAL 2006 (PRIOR TO THE FISCAL 2006 ANNUAL GRANT) AND FISCAL 2005 REFLECTED THE APPLICATION OF THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD SET OUT IN SEC STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 107 (SAB 107). THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD DEFINES THE EXPECTED TERM OF AN

OPTION AS THE AVERAGE OF THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE OPTIONS AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE VESTING PERIOD FOR ALL OPTION TRANCHES.

IN FISCAL

YEARS 2007, 2006 AND 2005, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OPTION-PRICING MODELS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

THE COMPANY UTILIZED THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL DURING FISCAL 2005.

(3)

THE EXPECTED TERM ASSUMPTION IS INCLUDED FOR FISCAL 2005 DURING WHICH WE UTILIZED

THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL. UNDER THE BINOMIAL MODEL, EXPECTED TERM IS NOT AN INPUT ASSUMPTION.

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL

FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS NOT ADJUSTED AFTER THE GRANT DATE, CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE THE VALUE OF, AND THEREFORE THE EXPENSE RELATED TO, FUTURE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE GREATEST VARIATION

IN FAIR VALUE IN THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ARE THE ASSUMED VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN EITHER THE ASSUMED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE WILL CAUSE THE BINOMIAL OPTION VALUE TO INCREASE OR

DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION CONSIDERS BOTH HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE

COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS AND STOCK OPTIONS IS

RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS IS BASED UPON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE AWARDS ON THE GRANT DATE; HOWEVER, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS IS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE

ESTIMATED PROBABILITY OF VESTING.

IN ANTICIPATION OF THE ABC RADIO TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY NEEDED TO DETERMINE

WHETHER EMPLOYEE EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS WOULD BE ADJUSTED FOR THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE TRANSACTION ON THE EMPLOYEE AWARDS. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS PLANS REQUIRED SUCH ADJUSTMENTS TO BE MADE ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS. ALL OTHER PLANS

PERMITTED SUCH ADJUSTMENTS TO BE MADE. IN ORDER TO TREAT ALL EMPLOYEES CONSISTENTLY WITH RESPECT TO THE ABC RADIO TRANSACTION (AND OTHER SIMILAR FUTURE TRANSACTIONS), THE COMPANY AMENDED THE PLANS SUCH THAT ALL PLANS REQUIRE EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENTS

FOR SUCH TRANSACTIONS. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE AMENDMENTS, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO RECORD A NON-CASH CHARGE OF $48 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007 REPRESENTING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THIS MODIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO VESTED

EQUITY-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AWARDS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE MODIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO UNVESTED AWARDS REMAINING AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 IS $14 MILLION AND WILL BE EXPENSED OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OF THESE AWARDS.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED

TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS BORROWING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND ON THE MARKET VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ITS FIXED RATE DEBT EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE.

THE COMPANY TYPICALLY USES PAY-FLOATING AND PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO FACILITATE ITS INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. PAY-FLOATING SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS

TO VARIABLE RATE INSTRUMENTS INDEXED TO LIBOR. PAY-FLOATING SWAP AGREEMENTS IN PLACE AT YEAR-END EXPIRE IN 1 TO 15 YEARS. PAY-FIXED SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS TO FIXED RATE INSTRUMENTS. THE PAY-FIXED SWAPS IN PLACE AT

YEAR-END EXPIRE IN 1 TO 9 YEARS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 RESPECTIVELY, THE COMPANY HELD $157 MILLION AND $192 MILLION NOTIONAL VALUE OF PAY-FIXED SWAPS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES. THE CHANGES IN MARKET

VALUES OF ALL SWAPS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS.

THE IMPACT OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT

FOR FISCAL 2007, 2006 AND 2005. THE NET AMOUNT OF DEFERRED GAINS IN AOCI FROM INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT TRANSACTIONS WAS $1 MILLION AND $5 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 RESPECTIVELY.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY

TRANSACTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES THEREBY ENABLING

MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, FIRM COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY USES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS

TO HEDGE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY HEDGES ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS FOR PERIODS GENERALLY NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM RANGE OF ANNUAL EXPOSURE. THE

COMPANY USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FIRM COMMITMENTS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED FORECASTED TRANSACTION, ASSET, LIABILITY OR

FIRM COMMITMENT. THE PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY- DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLARS.

MARK TO MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON CONTRACTS HEDGING FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED TO AOCI AND ARE RECLASSIFIED TO

CURRENT EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE REALIZED, OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD PRE-TAX DEFERRED GAINS OF $114 MILLION AND $106

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND PRE-TAX DEFERRED LOSSES OF $170 MILLION AND $60 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES ON FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS.

DEFERRED AMOUNTS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WILL CHANGE WITH MARKET CONDITIONS AND WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE RELATED HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. DEFERRED LOSSES RECORDED IN AOCI FOR

CONTRACTS THAT WILL MATURE IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS TOTALED $106 MILLION. THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED AFTER-TAX GAINS OF $34 MILLION AND LOSSES OF $6 MILLION FROM AOCI TO EARNINGS DURING FISCAL 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THESE LOSSES WERE OFFSET BY

CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED.

DURING FISCAL 2007 AND 2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED THE CHANGE IN

FAIR MARKET VALUE RELATED TO FAIR VALUE HEDGES AND THE INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES TO EARNINGS. THE AMOUNTS OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ON CASH FLOW HEDGES WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR FISCAL 2007, FISCAL 2006 AND FISCAL 2005. THE TOTAL IMPACT

OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ON OPERATING INCOME IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005 WERE LOSSES OF $139 MILLION, $27 MILLION, AND $168 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE NET LOSSES FROM THESE HEDGES OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT

VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED.

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS WITH, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE COUNTERPARTIES TO ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY THE

COUNTERPARTIES.

THE COMPANY WOULD NOT REALIZE A MATERIAL LOSS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY SINGLE

COUNTERPARTY. THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS ONLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF A- OR BETTER. THE COMPANYS CURRENT POLICY REGARDING AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES IS

GENERALLY TO REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A- OR IN THE EVENT AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED LIMITS AS DEFINED BY CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES AND INVESTMENTS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AT SEPTEMBER 29,

2007 DUE TO THE WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS INTO WHICH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD, THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO AMONG ISSUERS.

LEGAL MATTERS

MILNE AND DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. V. STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC

. ON NOVEMBER 5, 2002, CLARE MILNE, THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A. A. MILNE, AUTHOR OF THE WINNIE THE POOH BOOKS, AND THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DISNEY ENTERPRISES,

INC. (DEI) FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. (SSI) IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2002, MS. MILNE SERVED NOTICES TO SSI AND DEI TERMINATING A. A. MILNES

PRIOR GRANT OF RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004, AND GRANTED ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS TO DEI. IN THEIR LAWSUIT, MS. MILNE AND DEI SOUGHT A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, UNDER UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT LAW, THAT MS. MILNES

TERMINATION NOTICES WERE VALID; THAT SSIS RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH IN THE UNITED STATES TERMINATED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004; THAT UPON TERMINATION OF SSIS RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT THAT IS THE

SUBJECT OF THE

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

LAWSUIT TERMINATED BY OPERATION OF LAW; AND THAT, AS OF NOVEMBER 5, 2004, SSI WAS ENTITLED TO NO FURTHER ROYALTIES FOR USES OF WINNIE THE POOH. SSI FILED (A) AN

ANSWER DENYING THE MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT AND (B) COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT (I) MS. MILNES GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI IS VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE AND (II) DEI REMAINS OBLIGATED TO PAY SSI ROYALTIES

UNDER THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT. THE DISTRICT COURT RULED THAT MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE INVALID. THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED, AND ON JUNE 26, 2006, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DENIED

MILNES PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI. ON JUNE 23, 2003, SSI FILED AN AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS AND A THIRD-PARTY COMPLAINT AGAINST HARRIET HUNT (HEIR TO E. H. SHEPARD, ILLUSTRATOR OF THE ORIGINAL WINNIE THE POOH STORIES),

WHO HAD SERVED A NOTICE OF TERMINATION AND A GRANT OF RIGHTS SIMILAR TO MS. MILNES, AND ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE MILNE AND HUNT TERMINATIONS AND THE GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI FOR (A) UNLAWFUL

AND UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES; AND (B) BREACH OF THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT.

ON OCTOBER 19, 2006, THE PARTIES STIPULATED TO

SSIS FILING ITS FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS (FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER) SEEKING (A) TO INVALIDATE THE HUNT TERMINATION NOTICE, (B) TO TERMINATE THE COMPANYS RIGHTS VIS-À-VIS SSI, AND (C) DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF

TWO BILLION DOLLARS, AMONG OTHER RELIEF. THAT STIPULATION ALSO PROVIDED THAT HUNT AND THE COMPANY NEED NOT RESPOND TO THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF TWO EVENTS: THE STATE COURT APPEAL IN

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE

WALT DISNEY COMPANY

, AND THE TRIAL IN THE DISTRICT COURT ON THE VALIDITY OF THE HUNT TERMINATION NOTICE. SSI THEN SOUGHT TO WITHDRAW BOTH THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND ITS STIPULATION, BUT ON NOVEMBER 3, 2006, THE DISTRICT COURT DENIED

THAT REQUEST.

SSIS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE VALIDITY OF HUNTS 2002 ATTEMPT TO RECAPTURE E. H. SHEPARDS RIGHTS WAS GRANTED ON FEBRUARY 15, 2007, AND THEREAFTER, ON MARCH 27, 2007, THE DISTRICT COURT

DISMISSED AS MOOT ALL CLAIMS AGAINST HUNT AND THREE OF SSIS COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY RELATED TO THE COMPANYS AGREEMENTS WITH MILNE AND HUNT CONCERNING THE TERMINATION AND DISPOSITION OF THEIR RIGHTS. IN A RELATED DEVELOPMENT, ON

JANUARY 23, 2007, AND ON AUGUST 22, 2007, SSI INITIATED PROCEEDINGS IN THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (PTO) SEEKING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN POOH TRADEMARK REGISTRATIONS. ON FEBRUARY 22,

2007, THE PTO SUSPENDED THE FIRST PROCEEDING ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE RELIEF SOUGHT IS EFFECTIVELY DUPLICATIVE OF THAT SOUGHT IN THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER, AND ON OCTOBER 2, 2007, THE COMPANY MOVED TO SUSPEND THE SECOND PROCEEDING ON THE SAME

GROUND.

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY.

IN THIS LAWSUIT, FILED ON FEBRUARY 27, 1991, IN THE LOS

ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT, THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT A COMPANY SUBSIDIARY DEFRAUDED IT AND BREACHED A 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH PROPERTIES, BY FAILING TO ACCOUNT FOR AND PAY ROYALTIES ON REVENUES EARNED

FROM THE SALE OF WINNIE THE POOH MOVIES ON VIDEOCASSETTE AND FROM THE EXPLOITATION OF WINNIE THE POOH MERCHANDISING RIGHTS. THE PLAINTIFF SEEKS DAMAGES FOR THE LICENSEES ALLEGED BREACHES AS WELL AS CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAINTIFFS

INTERPRETATION OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE ACTIVITIES. THE PLAINTIFF ALSO SEEKS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT ON THE BASIS OF THE ALLEGED BREACHES. IF EACH OF THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS WERE TO BE CONFIRMED IN A

FINAL JUDGMENT, DAMAGES AS ARGUED BY THE PLAINTIFF COULD TOTAL AS MUCH AS SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE TO THE COMPANY OF ANY FUTURE EXPLOITATION OF THE LICENSED RIGHTS. ON MARCH 29, 2004, THE COURT GRANTED

THE COMPANYS MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF FOR A HOST OF DISCOVERY ABUSES, INCLUDING THE WITHHOLDING, ALTERATION, AND THEFT OF DOCUMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION, AND, ON APRIL 5, 2004, DISMISSED PLAINTIFFS

CASE WITH PREJUDICE. ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2007, THE CALIFORNIA COURT OF APPEAL AFFIRMED THE DISMISSAL, AND ON NOVEMBER 5, 2007, PLAINTIFF FILED A PETITION SEEKING REVIEW BY THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT.
