TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY

THE COMPANYS MEDIA NETWORKS BUSINESSES COMPETE FOR VIEWERS PRIMARILY WITH OTHER TELEVISION AND CABLE NETWORKS, INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATIONS AND OTHER MEDIA, SUCH AS DVDS, VIDEO GAMES AND THE

INTERNET. WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME, OUR BROADCASTING OPERATIONS, CERTAIN OF OUR CABLE NETWORKS AND OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS COMPETE WITH OTHER TELEVISION NETWORKS AND RADIO STATIONS, INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATIONS,

MVSPS AND OTHER ADVERTISING MEDIA SUCH AS NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, BILLBOARDS, AND THE INTERNET. OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS PRIMARILY COMPETE FOR VIEWERS IN INDIVIDUAL MARKET AREAS. A TELEVISION OR RADIO STATION IN ONE MARKET GENERALLY DOES NOT

COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH STATIONS IN OTHER MARKETS.

THE GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF NETWORKS DISTRIBUTED BY MVSPS HAS RESULTED IN

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FOR ADVERTISING REVENUES FOR BOTH OUR BROADCASTING AND CABLE NETWORKS. THE COMPANYS CABLE NETWORKS ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER CABLE NETWORKS FOR CARRIAGE BY MVSPS. THE COMPANYS CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS

WITH MVSPS ARE RENEWED OR RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE CABLE AND SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY

TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS VARIOUS CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE.

THE COMPANYS MEDIA NETWORKS BUSINESSES ALSO COMPETE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING. THE MARKET FOR PROGRAMMING IS VERY COMPETITIVE, PARTICULARLY FOR SPORTS PROGRAMMING. THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS SPORTS RIGHTS AGREEMENTS WITH THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE (NFL), COLLEGE FOOTBALL (INCLUDING COLLEGE BOWL GAMES) AND BASKETBALL CONFERENCES, NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION (NBA), NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STOCK CAR AUTO RACING

(NASCAR), MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL (MLB), WORLD CUP AND VARIOUS SOCCER LEAGUES, AND GOLF AND TENNIS ASSOCIATIONS.

THE

COMPANYS INTERNET WEB SITES AND DIGITAL PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH OTHER WEB SITES AND ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CATEGORIES.

ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE MEDIA NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING

THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS ARE MET, AND THESE COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND

HALF OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION DURING THIS PERIOD.

FEDERAL REGULATION

TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC)

UNDER FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. VIOLATION OF FCC REGULATIONS CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY FORFEITURES, LIMITED RENEWALS OF LICENSES AND, IN EGREGIOUS CASES, DENIAL OF LICENSE RENEWAL OR

REVOCATION OF A LICENSE. FCC REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



LICENSING OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS.

EACH OF THE TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE OWN MUST BE LICENSED BY THE FCC. THESE LICENSES ARE

GRANTED FOR PERIODS OF UP TO EIGHT YEARS, AND WE MUST OBTAIN RENEWAL OF LICENSES AS THEY EXPIRE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OPERATING THE STATIONS. WE (OR THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN THE CASE OF A DIVESTITURE) MUST ALSO OBTAIN FCC APPROVAL WHENEVER WE SEEK TO

HAVE A LICENSE TRANSFERRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OR DIVESTITURE OF A STATION. THE FCC MAY DECLINE TO RENEW OR APPROVE THE TRANSFER OF A LICENSE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE GENERALLY RECEIVED SUCH RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN

THE PAST, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ALWAYS OBTAIN NECESSARY RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE FUTURE.



TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP LIMITS.

THE FCC IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN

A SPECIFIC MARKET, ON THE COMBINED NUMBER OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SINGLE MARKET AND ON THE AGGREGATE PERCENTAGE OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE THAT CAN BE REACHED BY TELEVISION STATIONS WE OWN. CURRENTLY.



FCC REGULATIONS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN A MARKET, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND NATURE OF THE MARKET. WE DO NOT

OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN ANY OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN A TELEVISION STATION.



FEDERAL STATUTES PERMIT OUR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE AGGREGATE TO REACH A MAXIMUM OF 39% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE (FOR THIS PURPOSE, FCC REGULATIONS

DUAL NETWORKS.

FCC RULES CURRENTLY PROHIBIT ANY OF THE FOUR MAJOR TELEVISION NETWORKS  ABC, CBS, FOX AND NBC  FROM BEING UNDER

COMMON OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.



REGULATION OF PROGRAMMING.

THE FCC REGULATES BROADCAST PROGRAMMING BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BANNING INDECENT PROGRAMMING, REGULATING

POLITICAL ADVERTISING AND IMPOSING COMMERCIAL TIME LIMITS DURING CHILDRENS PROGRAMMING. BROADCASTERS FACE A HEIGHTENED RISK OF BEING FOUND IN VIOLATION OF THE INDECENCY PROHIBITION BY THE FCC BECAUSE OF RECENT FCC DECISIONS, COUPLED WITH THE

SPONTANEITY OF LIVE PROGRAMMING. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE FCC INCREASED ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO INDECENCY, AND A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT INDECENCY CASES AGAINST VARIOUS BROADCASTERS REMAIN PENDING IN THE COURTS. MOREOVER, THE

PENALTIES FOR BROADCASTING INDECENT PROGRAMMING ARE A MAXIMUM OF $325,000 PER VIOLATION.



FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND FCC RULES ALSO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL MATTER THAT MAY BE SHOWN ON BROADCAST OR CABLE CHANNELS DURING PROGRAMMING

DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN 12 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. IN ADDITION, BROADCAST CHANNELS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF THREE HOURS PER WEEK OF PROGRAMMING THAT HAS AS A SIGNIFICANT PURPOSE MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL AND

INFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN 16 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. FCC RULES ALSO GIVE TELEVISION STATION OWNERS THE RIGHT TO REJECT OR REFUSE NETWORK PROGRAMMING IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO SUBSTITUTE PROGRAMMING THAT THE LICENSEE REASONABLY BELIEVES

TO BE OF GREATER LOCAL OR NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.



CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS.

WITH RESPECT TO CABLE SYSTEMS OPERATING WITHIN A TELEVISION STATIONS

DESIGNATED MARKET AREA, FCC RULES REQUIRE THAT EVERY THREE YEARS EACH TELEVISION STATION ELECT EITHER MUST CARRY STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH CABLE OPERATORS GENERALLY MUST CARRY A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION IN THE STATIONS MARKET, OR

RETRANSMISSION CONSENT STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE CABLE OPERATOR MUST NEGOTIATE WITH THE TELEVISION STATION TO OBTAIN THE CONSENT OF THE TELEVISION STATION PRIOR TO CARRYING ITS SIGNAL. UNDER THE SATELLITE HOME VIEWER IMPROVEMENT ACT

AND ITS SUCCESSORS, INCLUDING MOST RECENTLY THE SATELLITE TELEVISION EXTENSION AND LOCALISM ACT (STELA), WHICH ALSO REQUIRES THE MUST CARRY OR RETRANSMISSION CONSENT ELECTION, SATELLITE CARRIERS ARE PERMITTED TO RETRANSMIT A

LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS SIGNAL INTO ITS LOCAL MARKET WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LOCAL TELEVISION STATION. UNDER MUST CARRY, IF A SATELLITE CARRIER ELECTS TO CARRY ONE LOCAL STATION IN A MARKET, THE SATELLITE CARRIER MUST CARRY THE SIGNALS OF

ALL LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS THAT ALSO REQUEST CARRIAGE.



DIGITAL TELEVISION.

PURSUANT TO FCC REGULATIONS, ALL OF THE COMPANYS STATIONS NOW OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY ON DIGITAL CHANNELS.



CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF PROGRAMMING.

THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND FCC RULES REGULATE SOME ASPECTS OF NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING CABLE AND

SATELLITE RETRANSMISSION CONSENT, AND SOME CABLE AND SATELLITE COMPANIES HAVE SOUGHT REGULATION OF ADDITIONAL ASPECTS OF THE CARRIAGE OF PROGRAMMING ON CABLE AND SATELLITE SYSTEMS. LITIGATION HAS BEEN INSTITUTED AGAINST THE COMPANY, OTHER PROGRAM

PROVIDERS AND DISTRIBUTORS SEEKING AMONG OTHER THINGS TO ACHIEVE SIMILAR ENDS. NEW LEGISLATION, COURT ACTION OR REGULATION IN THIS AREA COULD, DEPENDING ON ITS SPECIFIC NATURE, HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS.

THE FOREGOING IS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND OTHER LEGISLATION AND

OF SPECIFIC FCC RULES AND POLICIES. REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE TO THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT, OTHER LEGISLATION, FCC RULES AND PUBLIC NOTICES AND RULINGS OF THE FCC FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FCCS REGULATORY

RISK FACTORS

FOR AN

ENTERPRISE AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS THE COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS AFFECTING SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPERATIONS IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF

THESE OPERATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

CHANGES IN U.S., GLOBAL, OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES.

A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND

FOR ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, THUS REDUCING OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS. THE MOST RECENT DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REDUCED SPENDING AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS, PURCHASE OF AND PRICES FOR ADVERTISING ON OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND OWNED

STATIONS, PERFORMANCE OF OUR HOME ENTERTAINMENT RELEASES, AND PURCHASES OF COMPANY-BRANDED CONSUMER PRODUCTS, AND SIMILAR IMPACTS CAN BE EXPECTED SHOULD SUCH CONDITIONS RECUR. A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO REDUCE ATTENDANCE AT OUR

PARKS AND RESORTS OR PRICES THAT MVSPS PAY FOR OUR CABLE PROGRAMMING. RECENT INSTABILITY IN EUROPEAN ECONOMIES PRESENTS RISKS OF SIMILAR IMPACTS IN OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CAN ALSO IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THOSE WITH WHOM WE DO

BUSINESS TO SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN PRICE LEVELS GENERALLY, OR IN PRICE LEVELS IN A PARTICULAR SECTOR SUCH AS THE ENERGY SECTOR, COULD RESULT IN A SHIFT IN CONSUMER DEMAND AWAY FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER

PRODUCTS WE OFFER, WHICH COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASE OUR COSTS. CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY REDUCE INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCREASE OUR LABOR OR SUPPLY COSTS IN

NON-UNITED STATES MARKETS, OR REDUCE THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR VALUE OF REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER MARKETS.

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES IN PUBLIC AND CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD

REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES CREATE ENTERTAINMENT, TRAVEL OR CONSUMER PRODUCTS WHOSE SUCCESS DEPENDS SUBSTANTIALLY ON CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES

THAT CHANGE IN OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO CONSISTENTLY CREATE AND DISTRIBUTE FILMED ENTERTAINMENT, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ONLINE MATERIAL, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS,

HOTELS AND OTHER RESORT FACILITIES AND TRAVEL EXPERIENCES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE CHANGING PREFERENCES OF THE BROAD CONSUMER MARKET. MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON ACCEPTANCE OF OUR OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS BY CONSUMERS

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND THEIR SUCCESS THEREFORE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT AND ADAPT TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES OUTSIDE AS WELL AS INSIDE THE UNITED STATES. MOREOVER, WE MUST OFTEN INVEST SUBSTANTIAL

AMOUNTS IN FILM PRODUCTION, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, CRUISE SHIPS OR HOTELS AND OTHER RESORT FACILITIES BEFORE WE LEARN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PRODUCTS WILL EARN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. IF OUR

ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, OUR REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING SALES (WHICH ARE BASED IN PART ON RATINGS FOR THE PROGRAMS IN WHICH ADVERTISEMENTS AIR) OR SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR BROADCAST AND CABLE

PROGRAMMING AND ONLINE SERVICES, FROM THEATRICAL FILM RECEIPTS OR HOME VIDEO OR ELECTRONIC GAME SALES, FROM THEME PARK ADMISSIONS, HOTEL ROOM CHARGES AND MERCHANDISE, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES, FROM SALES OF LICENSED CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR FROM SALES OF

OUR OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY DECLINE OR FAIL TO GROW TO THE EXTENT WE ANTICIPATE WHEN MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES.

CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND IN CONSUMER CONSUMPTION PATTERNS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS OR THE COST OF PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING

PRODUCTS.

THE MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT AND INTERNET BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR ABILITY TO

ACQUIRE, DEVELOP, ADOPT AND EXPLOIT NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO DISTINGUISH OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGIES AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THE TIME AND MANNER IN WHICH CONSUMERS ACQUIRE AND VIEW

SOME OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO ADVERTISERS FOR REACHING THEIR DESIRED MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SUCCESS OF OUR OFFERINGS IN THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET DEPENDS IN PART ON CONSUMER PREFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO HOME

ENTERTAINMENT FORMATS, INCLUDING DVD PLAYERS AND PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDERS, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE HOME ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING WEB-BASED DELIVERY OF ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION, TECHNOLOGICAL

DEVELOPMENTS OFFER CONSUMERS AN EXPANDING ARRAY OF ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS AND DELIVERY VEHICLES WHICH MAY INCLUDE OPTIONS WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED, OR OPTIONS WE HAVE DEVELOPED BUT WHICH ENTAIL A SMALLER RETURN THAN WE REALIZE ON TRADITIONAL

OPTIONS. AS A RESULT, THE INCOME FROM OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS MAY DECLINE OR INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OR OUR EXPECTATIONS WHEN WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCTS.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE EXISTENCE AND MAINTENANCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES WE CREATE.

THE VALUE TO US OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF OUR

RIGHTS AS DEFINED BY APPLICABLE LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THOSE LAWS ARE CONSTRUED. IF THOSE LAWS ARE DRAFTED OR INTERPRETED IN WAYS THAT LIMIT THE EXTENT OR DURATION OF OUR RIGHTS, OR IF EXISTING LAWS ARE CHANGED,

OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY DECREASE, OR THE COST OF OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE.

THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF PROTECTING THESE RIGHTS OR REDUCE OUR REVENUES. NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION, AND

ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES, THE FALLING PRICES OF DEVICES INCORPORATING SUCH TECHNOLOGIES, AND INCREASED BROADBAND INTERNET SPEED AND PENETRATION HAVE MADE THE UNAUTHORIZED DIGITAL COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR FILMS, TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND OTHER

CREATIVE WORKS EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MORE CHALLENGING. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT UNAUTHORIZED USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY GENERALLY IS A SIGNIFICANT AND RAPIDLY GROWING

PHENOMENON. INADEQUATE LAWS OR WEAK ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN ONE COUNTRY CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE, DESPITE THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS. THESE DEVELOPMENTS REQUIRE US TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST UNLICENSED USE AND PRESENT THE RISK OF INCREASED LOSSES OF REVENUE AS A RESULT OF UNLICENSED DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION OF OUR

CONTENT AND SALES OF UNAUTHORIZED DVDS, BLU-RAY DISCS AND OTHER PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY

THE COMPANY AND RIGHTS ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY FROM OTHERS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF CHALLENGES TO OUR RIGHTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BY THIRD PARTIES. SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGES TO OUR RIGHTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY RESULT IN

INCREASED COSTS FOR OBTAINING RIGHTS OR THE LOSS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN REVENUE FROM THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF CHALLENGED RIGHTS. THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF ANY CHALLENGES TO ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT IT

CURRENTLY FORESEES HAVING A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS.

PROTECTION OF ELECTRONICALLY STORED DATA IS COSTLY AND IF OUR DATA IS COMPROMISED IN SPITE OF THIS

PROTECTION, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS, LOST OPPORTUNITIES AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

WE MAINTAIN INFORMATION

NECESSARY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AS WELL AS PERSONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES, IN DIGITAL FORM. DATA MAINTAINED IN DIGITAL FORM IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF INTRUSION,

TAMPERING AND THEFT. WE DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SYSTEMS TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING, BUT THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS IS COSTLY AND REQUIRES ONGOING MONITORING AND UPDATING AS TECHNOLOGIES CHANGE AND EFFORTS TO OVERCOME SECURITY

MEASURES BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED. MOREOVER, DESPITE OUR EFFORTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF INTRUSION TAMPERING AND THEFT CANNOT BE ELIMINATED ENTIRELY, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE REMAIN. IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE CONFIDENTIAL, PROPRIETARY AND

PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. WHILE WE OBTAIN ASSURANCES THAT THESE THIRD PARTIES WILL PROTECT THIS INFORMATION AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, MONITOR THE PROTECTIONS EMPLOYED BY THESE THIRD

PARTIES, THERE IS A RISK THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES MAY BE COMPROMISED. IF OUR DATA SYSTEMS ARE COMPROMISED, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS MAY BE IMPAIRED, WE MAY LOSE PROFITABLE OPPORTUNITIES OR THE VALUE OF THOSE

OPPORTUNITIES MAY BE DIMINISHED AND, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE MAY LOSE REVENUE AS A RESULT OF UNLICENSED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. IF PERSONAL INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES IS MISAPPROPRIATED, OUR REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND

EMPLOYEES MAY BE INJURED RESULTING IN LOSS OF BUSINESS OR MORALE, AND WE MAY INCUR COSTS TO REMEDIATE POSSIBLE INJURY TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES OR TO PAY FINES OR TAKE OTHER ACTION WITH RESPECT TO JUDICIAL OR REGULATORY ACTIONS ARISING OUT OF

THE INCIDENT.

A VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR INCREASE THE COST OF PROVIDING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

PARTICULARLY OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS, IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM. THE ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM, AS WELL AS DEMAND FOR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN

THE UNITED STATES, GLOBALLY OR IN SPECIFIC REGIONS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING: ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARISING FROM SHORT-TERM WEATHER PATTERNS OR LONG-TERM CHANGE OR NATURAL DISASTERS (SUCH AS EXCESSIVE

HEAT OR RAIN, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES); HEALTH CONCERNS; INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL OR MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS; AND TERRORIST ATTACKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN JAPAN IN MARCH 2011 RESULTED IN A PERIOD OF SUSPENSION OF OUR OPERATIONS

AND THOSE OF CERTAIN OF OUR LICENSEES IN JAPAN, INCLUDING TOKYO DISNEY RESORT AND RESULTED IN A LOSS OF REVENUE FROM THOSE OPERATIONS. THESE EVENTS AND OTHERS, SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN TRAVEL AND ENERGY COSTS AND COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACKS, INTRUSIONS OR

OTHER WIDESPREAD COMPUTING OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, MAY ALSO DAMAGE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THESE EVENTS. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE ROYALTIES FROM THE SALES OF OUR LICENSED

GOODS AND SERVICES BY THIRD PARTIES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESSES OPERATED UNDER BRANDS LICENSED FROM THE COMPANY, AND WE ARE THEREFORE DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESSES OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES FOR THAT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE. A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS

COULD INFLUENCE THE SUCCESS OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES AND IF NEGATIVE FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF OUR LICENSEES, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE OBTAIN INSURANCE AGAINST THE

RISK OF LOSSES RELATING TO SOME OF THESE EVENTS, GENERALLY INCLUDING PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO OUR PROPERTY AND RESULTING BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, CERTAIN INJURIES OCCURRING ON OUR PROPERTY AND LIABILITY FOR ALLEGED BREACH OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WHEN

INSURANCE IS OBTAINED IT IS SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITS OF LIABILITY. THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF COVERAGE WE OBTAIN VARY FROM TIME TO TIME DEPENDING ON OUR VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SPECIFIC TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS IN RELATION TO THE

COST OF OBTAINING COVERAGE FOR SUCH TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS.

CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY

INCREASE OUR COSTS OR OTHERWISE AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OCCUR

WE MAY NEED TO ADJUST OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES TO MEET THESE CHANGES OR WE MAY OTHERWISE FIND IT NECESSARY TO RESTRUCTURE OUR OPERATIONS OR PARTICULAR BUSINESSES OR ASSETS. IN ADDITION, EXTERNAL EVENTS INCLUDING ACCEPTANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL OFFERINGS

AND CHANGES IN MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS. WHEN THESE CHANGES OR EVENTS OCCUR, WE MAY INCUR COSTS TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND MAY NEED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF ASSETS. WE ALSO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING

OR NEW BUSINESSES, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS AND IN NEW BUSINESS LINES. IN RECENT YEARS, SUCH INVESTMENTS HAVE INCLUDED INVESTMENTS IN NEW CRUISE SHIPS, EXPANSION AND REPURPOSING OF CERTAIN OF OUR THEME PARK

ATTRACTIONS, AND DEVELOPMENT OF A RESORT FACILITY IN HAWAII. IN ADDITION, A JOINT VENTURE IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE RECENTLY BEGAN CONSTRUCTION OF A THEME PARK IN SHANGHAI, CHINA. SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS MAY HAVE SHORT-TERM RETURNS THAT ARE NEGATIVE

OR LOW AND THE ULTIMATE BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES MAY BE UNCERTAIN. IN ANY OF THESE EVENTS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE, WE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS OR RETURNS ON NEW INVESTMENTS MAY BE LOWER THAN

PRIOR TO THE CHANGE IN STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING.

TURMOIL IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND IMPEDE ACCESS TO OR INCREASE

THE COST OF FINANCING OUR OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS.

PAST DISRUPTIONS IN THE U.S. AND GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS

MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY BUSINESSES TO OBTAIN FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. IN ADDITION, EQUITY MARKETS HAVE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED RAPID AND WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN VALUE. THESE CONDITIONS TENDED TO INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING AND IF THEY RECUR,

OUR COST OF BORROWING COULD INCREASE AND IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES

WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. A DECREASE IN THESE RATINGS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE

DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING. PAST DISRUPTIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS ALSO IMPACTED SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. A SIMILAR DECLINE IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD AFFECT

OUR ABILITY TO SECURE CREDIT-WORTHY COUNTERPARTIES FOR OUR INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING PROGRAMS AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SETTLE EXISTING CONTRACTS.

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES FROM ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER AND FROM OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATIONAL

ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO MUST COMPETE TO OBTAIN HUMAN RESOURCES, PROGRAMMING AND OTHER RESOURCES WE REQUIRE IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE.

COMPETITION IN EACH OF THESE AREAS MAY DIVERT CONSUMERS FROM OUR CREATIVE OR OTHER PRODUCTS, OR TO OTHER

AT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS, PARKS AND RESORTS ADMISSIONS AND ROOM RATES, AND PRICES FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS FROM WHICH WE DERIVE LICENSE REVENUES. COMPETITION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF RESOURCES CAN INCREASE THE COST OF PRODUCING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

BY COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS AND CURRENT AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. WE MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THESE COSTS AS A RESULT OF MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING INCREASES IN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE.

IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN INVESTMENT RETURNS AND DISCOUNT RATES USED TO CALCULATE PENSION EXPENSE AND RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE VOLATILE AND MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS IN SOME YEARS. THESE MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS AS WELL AS

A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF PENSION AND POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ASSETS MAY PUT UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING PENSION AND POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS AND MAY INCREASE FUTURE FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY

SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE COULD REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF LONG-TERM PROGRAMMING OR CARRIAGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT RENEWED ON SUFFICIENTLY FAVORABLE TERMS.

WE ENTER INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR BOTH THE ACQUISITION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTS

FOR THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS FOR SPORTING EVENTS AND OTHER PROGRAMS, AND CONTRACTS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PROGRAMMING TO MVSPS. AS THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRE, WE MUST RENEW OR RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RENEW

THEM ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY LOSE PROGRAMMING RIGHTS OR DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS. EVEN IF THESE CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED, THE COST OF OBTAINING PROGRAMMING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE (OR INCREASE AT FASTER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE) OR THE REVENUE

FROM DISTRIBUTION OF PROGRAMS MAY BE REDUCED (OR INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE). WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, THE IMPACT OF THESE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS ON OUR

RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT REVENUES FROM PROGRAMMING BASED

ON THESE RIGHTS WILL EXCEED THE COST OF THE RIGHTS PLUS THE OTHER COSTS OF PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAMMING.

CHANGES IN

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES MAY IMPAIR THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BROADCAST NETWORKS AND

TELEVISION STATIONS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED, AND EACH OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF UNITED STATES AND OVERSEAS REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATIONS INCLUDE.



UNITED STATES FCC REGULATION OF OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO NETWORKS, OUR NATIONAL PROGRAMMING NETWORKS, AND OUR OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS. SEE

ITEM 1  BUSINESS  MEDIA NETWORKS, FEDERAL REGULATION.



ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION REGULATIONS.



FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS.



REGULATION OF THE SAFETY OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND THEME PARK OPERATIONS.



IMPOSITION BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES OF TRADE RESTRICTIONS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS OR MOTION PICTURE OR TELEVISION CONTENT REQUIREMENTS OR QUOTAS.



DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TAX LAWS OR CURRENCY CONTROLS.

CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE REGULATORY AREAS MAY REQUIRE US TO SPEND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS, OR MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE PROFITABLE.

OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OPERATION OF LAWS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.

OUR OPERATIONS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS ARE IN MANY CASES SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE RATHER THAN

UNITED STATES LAW. LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS DIFFER IN SIGNIFICANT RESPECTS FROM THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THESE DIFFERENCES CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REACT TO CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND OUR RIGHTS OR ABILITY TO ENFORCE RIGHTS MAY BE

DIFFERENT THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED UNDER UNITED STATES LAW. MOREOVER, ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS IN SOME OVERSEAS JURISDICTIONS CAN BE INCONSISTENT AND UNPREDICTABLE, WHICH CAN AFFECT BOTH OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS AND TO UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES THAT WE

BELIEVE ARE BENEFICIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE AND OUR EXPENSES IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS MAY DIFFER FROM WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED IF UNITED STATES LAW GOVERNED THESE OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LABOR DISPUTES MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR

BUSINESSES.

A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN VARIOUS OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS AS WELL AS WRITERS, DIRECTORS, ACTORS, PRODUCTION PERSONNEL AND OTHERS EMPLOYED IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS AND STUDIO OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE EMPLOYEES OF LICENSEES WHO MANUFACTURE AND

RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS, AND EMPLOYEES OF PROVIDERS OF PROGRAMMING CONTENT (SUCH AS SPORTS LEAGUES) MAY BE COVERED BY LABOR AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS. IN GENERAL, A LABOR DISPUTE INVOLVING OUR EMPLOYEES OR THE EMPLOYEES OF OUR

LICENSEES OR RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR PROVIDERS OF PROGRAMMING CONTENT MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUES, AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS.

PROVISIONS IN OUR CORPORATE DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE STATE LAW COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL, EVEN IF THAT CHANGE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO

SHAREHOLDERS.

OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION CONTAINS A PROVISION REGULATING THE ABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS TO

BRING MATTERS FOR ACTION BEFORE ANNUAL AND SPECIAL MEETINGS AND AUTHORIZES OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE AND SET THE TERMS OF PREFERRED STOCK. THE REGULATIONS ON SHAREHOLDER ACTION COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ANY PERSON SEEKING TO ACQUIRE

CONTROL OF THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF ACTIONS THAT WOULD SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD EFFECTIVELY DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF ANY PERSON SEEKING CONTROL OR OTHERWISE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN

CONTROL. IN ADDITION, PROVISIONS IN OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION REQUIRE SUPERMAJORITY SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF SOME ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW,

EITHER OF WHICH COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE OF CONTROL IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE SEASONALITY OF CERTAIN OF

OUR BUSINESSES COULD EXACERBATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES IS NORMALLY SUBJECT TO

SEASONAL VARIATIONS, AS FOLLOWS.



REVENUES IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. IN GENERAL, ADVERTISING REVENUES

ARE SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS ARE MET,

AND THESE COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION DURING THIS PERIOD.



REVENUES IN OUR PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY RESULTING FROM THE SEASONAL NATURE OF

VACATION TRAVEL AND LOCAL ENTERTAINMENT EXCURSIONS. PEAK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY GENERALLY OCCUR DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN SCHOOL VACATIONS OCCUR AND DURING EARLY-WINTER AND SPRING-HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT, AND

TELEVISION MARKETS. RELEASE DATES ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF THEATRICAL

RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS.



REVENUES IN OUR INTERACTIVE MEDIA SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF VIDEO GAME RELEASES WHICH ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING THEATRICAL RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS, COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF HOLIDAY PERIODS. REVENUES FROM CERTAIN OF OUR INTERNET AND MOBILE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR SEASONAL TRENDS.

ACCORDINGLY, IF A SHORT TERM NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OCCURS DURING A TIME OF HIGH SEASONAL DEMAND (SUCH AS HURRICANE DAMAGE TO

OUR PARKS DURING THE SUMMER TRAVEL SEASON), THE EFFECT COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF THAT BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

CELADOR INTERNATIONAL LTD. V. AMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANIES, INC.

ON MAY 19, 2004, AN AFFILIATE OF THE CREATOR AND

LICENSOR OF THE TELEVISION PROGRAM,

WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE,

FILED AN ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING AMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANIES, INC. AND BUENA VISTA TELEVISION, LLC, ALLEGING IT

WAS DAMAGED BY DEFENDANTS IMPROPERLY ENGAGING IN CERTAIN INTRA-COMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND CHARGING MERCHANDISE DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES, RESULTING IN AN UNDERPAYMENT TO THE PLAINTIFF. ON JULY 7, 2010, THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT FOR BREACH OF

CONTRACT AGAINST CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY, AWARDING PLAINTIFF DAMAGES OF $269.4 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS STIPULATED WITH THE PLAINTIFF TO AN AWARD OF PREJUDGMENT INTEREST OF $50 MILLION, WHICH AMOUNT WILL BE REDUCED PRO RATA

SHOULD THE COURT OF APPEALS REDUCE THE DAMAGES AMOUNT. ON DECEMBER 21, 2010, THE COMPANYS ALTERNATIVE MOTIONS FOR A NEW TRIAL AND FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW WERE DENIED. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS

LAWSUIT, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE JURYS VERDICT IS IN ERROR AND IS VIGOROUSLY PURSUING ITS POSITION ON APPEAL, NOTICE OF WHICH WAS FILED BY THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 14, 2011. ON OR ABOUT JANUARY 28, 2011, PLAINTIFF FILED A NOTICE OF

CROSS-APPEAL. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE A PROBABLE LOSS UNDER THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARD RELATING TO PROBABILITY OF LOSS FOR RECORDING A RESERVE WITH RESPECT TO THIS LITIGATION AND THEREFORE HAS NOT RECORDED A RESERVE.

THE COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES, CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR CODEFENDANT IN

VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS INVOLVING COPYRIGHT, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE COMPANY TO SUFFER ANY MATERIAL LIABILITY BY REASON OF THESE ACTIONS.

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE NUMBERS PRESENTED IN FISCAL 2010 AND FISCAL 2009 TO CONFORM TO THE FISCAL 2011 PRESENTATION

REVENUES

AFFILIATE FEE GROWTH OF 9% WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES OF 6% FROM HIGHER CONTRACTUAL RATES, 1% FROM FAVORABLE IMPACTS OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, AND 1% FROM SUBSCRIBER GROWTH AT CABLE NETWORKS AND AN

INCREASE OF 1% FROM BROADCASTING DUE TO NEW CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS.

HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUES WERE DUE TO AN INCREASE OF

$471 MILLION AT CABLE NETWORKS FROM $3,051 MILLION TO $3,522 MILLION AND AN INCREASE OF $99 MILLION AT BROADCASTING FROM $3,977 MILLION TO $4,076 MILLION. THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS OF 14% WAS DUE TO HIGHER RATES. THE INCREASE AT BROADCASTING

REFLECTED INCREASES OF 6% DUE TO HIGHER NETWORK ADVERTISING RATES, PRIMARILY AT PRIMETIME, AND 1% DUE TO HIGHER LOCAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF 4% DUE TO LOWER NETWORK RATINGS PRIMARILY AT PRIMETIME AND DAYTIME.

THE INCREASE IN OTHER REVENUES WAS DRIVEN BY A CHANGE IN THE TRANSFER PRICING ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT AND

MEDIA NETWORKS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA NETWORKS HOME ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCT AND HIGHER SALES OF DISNEY CHANNEL PROGRAMMING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS DRIVEN BY NO NEW SEASONS OF

LOST

AND

GHOST

WHISPERER.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS WHICH INCREASED $249 MILLION FROM $8,453 MILLION TO $8,702 MILLION. AT CABLE NETWORKS, AN INCREASE IN PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION SPENDING OF

$457 MILLION WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER SPORTS RIGHTS COSTS DUE TO THE ADDITION OF COLLEGE FOOTBALL PROGRAMMING INCLUDING BOWL CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES GAMES, INCREASED CONTRACTUAL COSTS FOR COLLEGE AND PROFESSIONAL SPORTS PROGRAMMING AND MORE EPISODES OF

ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING AT THE DISNEY CHANNELS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR THE FIFA WORLD CUP WHICH WAS BROADCAST IN THE PRIOR YEAR. AT BROADCASTING, PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS DECREASED $208 MILLION REFLECTING LOWER

NEWS AND DAYTIME PRODUCTION COSTS DUE TO COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES, A LOWER COST MIX OF PROGRAMMING IN PRIMETIME DUE TO A SHIFT OF HOURS FROM ORIGINAL SCRIPTED PROGRAMMING TO REALITY PROGRAMMING, A SHIFT OF COLLEGE SPORTS PROGRAMMING TO ESPN AND

LOWER PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION DUE TO A DECREASE IN SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO REFLECTED A 2% INCREASE DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE TRANSFER PRICING ARRANGEMENT FOR DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA NETWORKS HOME ENTERTAINMENT

PRODUCT AND A 1% INCREASE DUE TO HIGHER LABOR COSTS AT ESPN DUE TO HEADCOUNT GROWTH AND LABOR COST INFLATION.

THE INCREASE IN

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER MARKETING AND SALES COSTS, WHICH INCLUDED AN INCREASE DUE TO THE CHANGE IN TRANSFER PRICING ARRANGEMENT FOR DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA NETWORKS HOME ENTERTAINMENT

PRODUCT AND HIGHER MARKETING COSTS AT ESPN.

EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES

INCOME FROM EQUITY INVESTEES INCREASED TO $584 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR FROM $438 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE AT

AETN/LIFETIME PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF A $58 MILLION CHARGE FOR OUR SHARE OF PROGRAMMING WRITE-OFFS AT AETN/LIFETIME IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND HIGHER ADVERTISING AND AFFILIATE REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER MARKETING COSTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

REVENUE GROWTH OF 11% AT OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS REFLECTED A 6% INCREASE DRIVEN BY HIGHER AVERAGE GUEST SPENDING AND A 3%

INCREASE DUE TO VOLUME DRIVEN BY HIGHER PASSENGER CRUISE SHIP DAYS DUE TO THE LAUNCH OF OUR NEW CRUISE SHIP, THE

DISNEY DREAM

, IN JANUARY 2011, AND HIGHER ATTENDANCE. HIGHER GUEST SPENDING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE TICKET PRICES,

DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATES, AND FOOD, BEVERAGE, AND MERCHANDISE SPENDING.

REVENUE GROWTH OF 6% AT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS

REFLECTED A 4% INCREASE DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE GUEST SPENDING, A 3% INCREASE DRIVEN BY VOLUME DUE TO HIGHER ATTENDANCE AND HOTEL OCCUPANCY, AND A 3% FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S.

DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 2% DECREASE DUE TO THE PRIOR-YEAR SALE OF A REAL ESTATE PROPERTY AT DISNEYLAND PARIS AND A 1% DECREASE DUE TO THE TEMPORARY CLOSURE OF THE TOKYO DISNEY RESORT FOLLOWING THE MARCH

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE OPERATING LABOR WHICH

INCREASED BY $262 MILLION FROM $3,278 MILLION TO $3,540 MILLION DRIVEN BY LABOR COST INFLATION AND HIGHER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSES. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE COST OF SALES WHICH INCREASED $88 MILLION FROM $1,110 MILLION TO

$1,198 MILLION DRIVEN BY VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF THE COSTS RELATED TO A PRIOR-YEAR REAL ESTATE SALE AT DISNEYLAND PARIS. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED DUE TO LAUNCH AND OPERATING COSTS IN CONNECTION WITH THE

DISNEY

DREAM

, ENHANCEMENT AND EXPANSION COSTS, INCLUDING NEW GUEST OFFERINGS AT DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE AND INVESTMENTS IN OUR SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURE, AND COSTS FOR AULANI, OUR NEW HOTEL AND VACATION CLUB RESORT IN HAWAII. IN ADDITION THERE WAS AN

UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO.

THE

INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER MARKETING COSTS AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADDITIONAL CRUISE SHIP AND OUR NEW RESORT IN HAWAII, AND LABOR COST

INFLATION.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 18%, OR $235 MILLION, TO $1.6 BILLION DUE TO INCREASES AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COSTS FOR OUR NEW RESORT IN

LOWER HOME ENTERTAINMENT

REVENUE REFLECTED AN 11% DECREASE DUE TO THE CHANGE IN THE TRANSFER PRICING ARRANGEMENT FOR STUDIO DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA NETWORKS HOME ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 1% INCREASE DUE TO HIGHER NET EFFECTIVE PRICING INTERNATIONALLY WHICH

BENEFITTED FROM A HIGHER BLU-RAY SALES MIX. NET EFFECTIVE PRICING IS THE WHOLESALE SELLING PRICE ADJUSTED FOR DISCOUNTS, SALES INCENTIVES AND RETURNS.

THE INCREASE IN TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER REVENUES REFLECTED 5% GROWTH DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF MARVEL WHICH WAS ACQUIRED AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR AND A 4% INCREASE DUE TO

HIGHER REVENUE SHARE FROM THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT RESULTING FROM THE STRENGTH OF

CARS

MERCHANDISE.

COST AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED A DECREASE OF $262 MILLION IN FILM COST AMORTIZATION, FROM $2,142 MILLION TO $1,880 MILLION,

DRIVEN BY LOWER FILM COST WRITE-DOWNS. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE COST OF SALES AND DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES WHICH DECREASED $71 MILLION FROM $1,327 MILLION TO $1,256 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CHANGE IN THE TRANSFER PRICING ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN

STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT AND MEDIA NETWORKS FOR DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA NETWORKS HOME ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCT.

SELLING, GENERAL,

ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT AS HIGHER MARKETING FOR MARVEL TITLES AND AN INCREASE IN TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY LOWER THEATRICAL PRE-RELEASE MARKETING EXPENSE AND THE CHANGE IN THE TRANSFER

PRICING ARRANGEMENT WITH MEDIA NETWORKS FOR HOME ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCT.

THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS

DRIVEN BY HIGHER AMORTIZATION ON INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO CERTAIN MARVEL FILM PROPERTIES.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 11%, OR $75 MILLION, TO $618 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER RESULTS AT OUR THEATRICAL AND HOME

ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES AND HIGHER TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE SPENDING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER FILM COST WRITE-DOWNS AND A HIGHER REVENUE SHARE WITH THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT.

THE INCREASE IN RETAIL AND OTHER REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A 9% INCREASE FROM HIGHER REVENUES AT THE DISNEY STORE IN NORTH AMERICA

AND EUROPE DRIVEN BY HIGHER COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND A 6% INCREASE RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF THE DISNEY STORE JAPAN, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010.

LICENSING AND PUBLISHING AND RETAIL AND OTHER REVENUES ALSO INCREASED BY 2% AND 3%, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO THE BENEFIT FROM A FAVORABLE

IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED AN INCREASE OF $57 MILLION IN COST OF GOODS SOLD, FROM $521 MILLION TO $578 MILLION, DRIVEN BY THE

ACQUISITIONS OF THE DISNEY STORE JAPAN AND MARVEL. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDED A 2% INCREASE DUE TO HIGHER OCCUPANCY COSTS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE AT OUR RETAIL BUSINESS REFLECTING THE ACQUISITION OF THE DISNEY STORE JAPAN AND A 1% INCREASE DUE

TO AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO.

THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS WAS DRIVEN BY AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN

CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO; THE INCLUSION OF A FULL YEAR OF OPERATIONS FOR MARVEL AND VARIOUS PROMOTIONAL INITIATIVES ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES.

THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS DUE TO A FULL YEAR OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR MARVEL AND AN INCREASE AT THE DISNEY STORES DUE TO AN INCREASE IN NEW STORES AND REMODELS.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 21%, OR $139 MILLION, TO $816 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN OUR MERCHANDISE LICENSING AND NORTH AMERICAN RETAIL BUSINESSES.

RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

THE COMPANY RECORDED CHARGES TOTALING $16 MILLION AND $19 MILLION RELATED TO CONSUMER PRODUCTS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE CHARGES IN FISCAL 2010 AND 2009 WERE FOR SEVERANCE AND

REVENUES

GAME SALES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUE GROWTH REFLECTED A 12% INCREASE DUE TO HIGHER CONSOLE GAME UNIT SALES AND A 10% INCREASE DUE TO HIGHER NET EFFECTIVE PRICING OF CONSOLE GAMES, REFLECTING THE STRONG

PERFORMANCE OF

EPIC MICKEY

AND

LEGO PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN

AND A SHIFT IN SALES FROM CATALOG TITLES TO NEW RELEASES. ADDITIONALLY, THE INCLUSION OF PLAYDOM FOR A FULL YEAR COMPARED TO ONE MONTH IN THE PRIOR YEAR RESULTED IN A 10%

INCREASE IN GAME SALES AND SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES.

HIGHER ADVERTISING AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY OUR MOBILE PHONE SERVICE

IN JAPAN.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSE INCLUDED A $60 MILLION INCREASE IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE FROM $335 MILLION TO $395 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF PLAYDOM FOR A FULL YEAR. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO

INCLUDED A 12% INCREASE DUE TO HIGHER COST OF SALES DRIVEN BY FEES PAID TO THE DEVELOPER OF

LEGO PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN

AND HIGHER CONSOLE GAME UNIT SALES.

THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF PLAYDOM FOR A FULL YEAR, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING.

SEGMENT OPERATING LOSS

SEGMENT OPERATING LOSS WAS $308 MILLION COMPARED TO $234 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR AS AN IMPROVEMENT AT OUR CONSOLE GAME BUSINESS WAS MORE

THE DECREASE IN INTEREST EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR REFLECTED LOWER EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES.

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED 0.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 34.9% IN 2010 TO 34.6% IN 2011 AS THE ABSENCE OF A CHARGE RELATED TO THE HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION AND A BENEFIT FROM AN INCREASE IN THE

DOMESTIC PRODUCTION DEDUCTION RATE WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN FAVORABLE RESOLUTIONS OF PRIOR-YEAR TAX MATTERS. DURING FISCAL 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $72 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE ENACTMENT OF HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION IN

MARCH 2010. UNDER THIS LEGISLATION THE COMPANYS DEDUCTIONS FOR RETIREE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS WILL BE REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT OF MEDICARE PART D DRUG SUBSIDIES RECEIVED BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR 2014. UNDER APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING RULES, THE

COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO REDUCE ITS EXISTING DEFERRED TAX ASSET, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED FOR THE FUTURE DEDUCTIBILITY OF RETIREE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT COSTS, TO REFLECT THE LOST DEDUCTIONS. THE REDUCTION WAS RECORDED AS A CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN THE

PERIOD THE LEGISLATION WAS ENACTED.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS FOR THE YEAR INCREASED $101 MILLION TO $451 MILLION DUE TO IMPROVED OPERATING RESULTS AT ESPN AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT. THE NET INCOME

ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IS DETERMINED ON INCOME AFTER ROYALTIES, FINANCING COSTS AND INCOME TAXES.

PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN COSTS AFFECT RESULTS IN ALL OF OUR

SEGMENTS, WITH APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THESE COSTS BEING BORNE BY THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSES OF $576 MILLION, $482 MILLION, AND $214 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2011,

2010, AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2011 WAS DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED FROM A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE

YIELD CURVES.

WE EXPECT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION TO $626 MILLION IN

FISCAL 2012 DRIVEN BY A LOWER ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A FAVORABLE IMPACT DUE TO PLAN AMENDMENTS. THE DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE ALSO RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF OUR PLANS AND AN INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE TO $4.2 BILLION ($2.6 BILLION AFTER TAX) AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011. IF OUR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE DOES NOT IMPROVE RELATIVE TO OUR LONG-TERM ASSUMPTION AND/OR DISCOUNT RATES DO NOT INCREASE, WE EXPECT THAT

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS WILL CONTINUE AT LEVELS COMPARABLE TO FISCAL 2012 FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS A RESULT OF AMORTIZING THESE UNRECOGNIZED EXPENSES. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF THE

IMPACTS OF OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND AMENDMENTS WE MADE TO OUR PLANS IN FISCAL 2011. DURING FISCAL 2011, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $935 MILLION TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS

INCLUDING DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS IN FISCAL 2012 TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $325 MILLION TO $375 MILLION. FINAL

MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR FISCAL 2012 WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON OUR JANUARY 1, 2012 FUNDING ACTUARIAL VALUATION WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE IN LATE FISCAL 2012. SEE ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS FOR THE IMPACT OF FACTORS

AFFECTING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS.

BROADCASTING A DECREASE IN PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS OF $69 MILLION WAS DRIVEN BY COSTS SAVINGS AT NEWS AND DAYTIME AND A LOWER COST MIX OF PROGRAMMING IN PRIMETIME.

THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND COMPENSATION RELATED COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF

2010.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 8%, OR $367 MILLION, TO $5.1 BILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES AT ESPN, THE OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS AND THE INTERNATIONAL DISNEY CHANNELS, PARTIALLY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2011 INCREASED 6% OR $416 MILLION TO $7.0 BILLION AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER OPERATING CASH RECEIPTS DRIVEN BY

HIGHER REVENUES AT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS, PARKS AND RESORTS, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND INTERACTIVE MEDIA BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUES AT OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CASH PAYMENTS AT

CORPORATE AND AT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS, PARKS AND RESORTS, INTERACTIVE MEDIA, AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS. THE INCREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT CORPORATE WAS DRIVEN

BY HIGHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLANS, WHILE THE INCREASE AT MEDIA NETWORKS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INVESTMENT IN TELEVISION PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION. THE INCREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT PARKS AND RESORTS WAS DRIVEN BY LABOR COST

INFLATION, HIGHER PROMOTIONAL AND OPERATING COSTS FROM THE JANUARY LAUNCH OF OUR NEW CRUISE SHIP, THE

DISNEY DREAM

, AND HIGHER MARKETING AND SALES EXPENSES AND EXPANSION COSTS FOR DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE AT DISNEYLAND RESORT. THE INCREASE

IN CASH PAYMENTS AT INTERACTIVE MEDIA REFLECTS THE INCLUSION OF PLAYDOM, WHILE THE INCREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT CONSUMER PRODUCTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF THE DISNEY STORE JAPAN AND MARVEL. THE DECREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT STUDIO

ENTERTAINMENT WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER FILM PRODUCTION SPENDING.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2010 INCREASED

24% OR $1.3 BILLION TO $6.6 BILLION AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER OPERATING CASH RECEIPTS AT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS, PARKS AND RESORTS AND STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES AND LOWER CASH PAYMENTS AT OUR STUDIO

ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING EXPENSE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS. THE INCREASE IN CASH RECEIPTS AT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS AND STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENTS WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUES,

WHILE THE INCREASE IN CASH RECEIPTS AT PARKS AND RESORTS WAS DRIVEN BY THE TIMING OF ADVANCE TRAVEL DEPOSITS.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT ARE PRINCIPALLY FOR THEME PARK AND RESORT

EXPANSION, CRUISE SHIPS, NEW RIDES AND ATTRACTIONS, RECURRING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. THE INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS IN FISCAL 2011 REFLECTED THE FINAL PAYMENT ON OUR NEW CRUISE SHIP,

THE

DISNEY DREAM

, THEME PARK AND RESORT EXPANSIONS AND NEW GUEST OFFERINGS AT WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT. THE INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS IN FISCAL 2010 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009 REFLECTED HIGHER CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS PAYMENTS ON THE TWO NEW CRUISE SHIPS, THE EXPANSIONS AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT AND DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE AND THE CONSTRUCTION

OF AULANI, A DISNEY RESORT & SPA IN HAWAII. THE INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT CONSUMER PRODUCTS FROM FISCAL 2009 TO FISCAL 2011 WAS DRIVEN BY COSTS AT THE DISNEY STORES FOR NEW STORES AND REMODELS.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT MEDIA NETWORKS PRIMARILY REFLECT INVESTMENTS IN FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT FOR EXPANDING AND UPGRADING BROADCAST

CENTERS, PRODUCTION FACILITIES, AND TELEVISION STATION FACILITIES.

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT CORPORATE PRIMARILY REFLECT INVESTMENTS IN CORPORATE FACILITIES AND

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE. THE INCREASES IN FISCAL 2011 AND 2010 WERE DRIVEN BY INVESTMENTS IN EQUIPMENT AND CORPORATE FACILITIES.

OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES

DURING FISCAL 2011, PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSITIONS OF $564 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALE OF MIRAMAX, WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ACQUISITIONS TOTALING $184 MILLION WHICH INCLUDED ADDITIONAL PAYMENTS RELATED

TO THE ACQUISITION OF PLAYDOM, INC. (SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

DURING FISCAL 2010, ACQUISITIONS

TOTALED $2.5 BILLION AND INCLUDED THE ACQUISITIONS OF MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT, INC. AND PLAYDOM, INC., AND WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET PROCEEDS TOTALING $170 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF OUR INVESTMENTS IN TWO TELEVISION SERVICES IN EUROPE AND THE SALE OF

THE RIGHTS AND ASSETS RELATED TO THE POWER RANGERS PROPERTY.

DURING FISCAL 2009, ACQUISITIONS TOTALED $176 MILLION AND

INCLUDED THE PURCHASE OF ADDITIONAL INTERESTS IN UTV (SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), OFFSET BY PROCEEDS TOTALING $185 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN TWO PAY TELEVISION SERVICES IN LATIN AMERICA.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2011 INCREASED BY $570 MILLION TO $3.2 BILLION COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010 AND CONSISTED OF

REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BORROWINGS AND PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS. THE INCREASE FROM FISCAL 2010 WAS DUE TO HIGHER REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER NET

BORROWINGS. CASH USED IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2010 DECREASED BY $448 MILLION TO $2.7 BILLION COMPARED TO FISCAL 2009 AND CONSISTED OF REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK, REPAYMENTS OF BORROWINGS, AND THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

PROCEEDS FROM THE EXERCISE OF STOCK OPTIONS. THE DECREASE FROM FISCAL 2009 WAS DUE TO LOWER REPAYMENTS OF BORROWINGS AND INCREASED PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SHARE REPURCHASES.

IN FEBRUARY 2011, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW FOUR-YEAR $2.25 BILLION BANK FACILITY WITH A SYNDICATE

OF LENDERS. THIS FACILITY, IN COMBINATION WITH THE FACILITY THAT MATURES IN 2013, IS USED TO SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS. THE NEW BANK FACILITY ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ISSUE UP TO $800 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT, WHICH IF UTILIZED, REDUCES

AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER THIS FACILITY. AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011, $315 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT HAD BEEN ISSUED OF WHICH $47 MILLION WAS ISSUED UNDER THIS FACILITY. THESE BANK FACILITIES ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS AT LIBOR-BASED RATES PLUS A

SPREAD, WHICH DEPENDS ON THE COMPANYS PUBLIC DEBT RATING AND CAN RANGE FROM 0.33% TO 4.50%.

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY MAY USE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS UP TO THE AMOUNT OF ITS UNUSED BANK

FACILITIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH TERM DEBT ISSUANCE AND OPERATING CASH FLOW, TO RETIRE OR REFINANCE OTHER BORROWINGS BEFORE OR AS THEY COME DUE.

THE COMPANY PAID A $0.40 PER SHARE DIVIDEND ($756 MILLION) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2011 RELATED TO FISCAL 2010. THE COMPANY PAID A $0.35 PER SHARE DIVIDEND ($653 MILLION) DURING THE SECOND

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010 RELATED TO FISCAL 2009; AND PAID A $0.35 PER SHARE DIVIDEND ($648 MILLION) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009 RELATED TO FISCAL 2008. AS OF THE FILING DATE OF THIS REPORT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD NOT YET DECLARED A

DIVIDEND RELATED TO FISCAL 2011.

DURING FISCAL 2011, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 135 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK

FOR $5.0 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2010, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 80 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $2.7 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 5 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $138 MILLION. ON MARCH 22,

2011, THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF SHARES THAT CAN BE REPURCHASED TO 400 MILLION SHARES AS OF THAT DATE. AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011, THE COMPANY HAD REMAINING AUTHORIZATION IN PLACE TO REPURCHASE 305 MILLION

ADDITIONAL SHARES.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH BALANCES, OTHER LIQUID

ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING

BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAN BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL. SEE ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS. IN ADDITION

TO MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE COMPANYS BORROWING COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CERTAIN

CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011, MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A2 AND P-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK; STANDARD &

POORS LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A AND A-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK; AND FITCHS LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A AND F-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK. THE COMPANYS

BANK FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT, RELATING TO INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE COMPANY MET ON OCTOBER 1, 2011, BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. THE COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES ALSO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE CERTAIN ENTITIES, SUCH AS

DISNEYLAND PARIS, HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT AND SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT, FROM ANY REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

DISNEYLAND PARIS HAS IN ITS DEBT AGREEMENTS CERTAIN ANNUAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES AND LIMITS ON INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. IN FISCAL 2011, DISNEYLAND PARIS DID NOT MEET ITS ANNUAL

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES AND MUST DEFER 25 MILLION OF ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES PAYABLE TO THE COMPANY AND 20 MILLION OF INTEREST PAYABLE TO A FRENCH STATE BANK. ADDITIONALLY, AS A RESULT OF THE FACT THAT THE PERFORMANCE

OBJECTIVES WERE NOT MET, CERTAIN OF DISNEYLAND PARISS INVESTMENT ACTIVITIES ARE FURTHER LIMITED BY THE DEBT AGREEMENTS.

DISNEYLAND PARIS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO CERTAIN FINANCIAL COVENANTS AND BELIEVES THAT IT IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH SUCH COVENANTS WITH THE

ASSISTANCE OF THE COMPANYS AGREEMENT, AS PERMITTED UNDER THE DEBT AGREEMENTS, TO DEFER AN ADDITIONAL 9 MILLION OF ROYALTIES PAYABLE TO THE COMPANY INTO SUBORDINATED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS.

THE DEFERRALS DISCUSSED ABOVE AND COMPLIANCE WITH THESE FINANCIAL COVENANTS ARE SUBJECT TO FINAL THIRD-PARTY REVIEW AS PROVIDED IN

DISNEYLAND PARISS DEBT AGREEMENTS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS WHICH ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OTHER ITEMS,

SUCH AS CERTAIN PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND OTHER EXECUTORY CONTRACTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT ARE REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN THE FOOTNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPANY IS

CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO ACQUIRE BROADCAST PROGRAMMING AND MAKE CERTAIN MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS FOR THE USE OF PROPERTY UNDER OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS.

THE COMPANY HAS CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE PAYMENTS OR PROVIDE FUNDING IF CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THESE ARRANGEMENTS WILL RESULT IN ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS BEING PAID BY THE COMPANY.

SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE

COMPANYS CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL GUARANTEES.

LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS

AS DISCLOSED IN NOTES 10 AND 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR CERTAIN LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF

MANAGEMENT. FOR A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND COSTS

WE EXPENSE FILM AND TELEVISION

PRODUCTION, PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS REVENUES TO THE ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FOR EACH PRODUCTION. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF

ULTIMATE REVENUES DECREASES, AMORTIZATION OF FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED. CONVERSELY, IF ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES INCREASE, FILM AND TELEVISION COST AMORTIZATION MAY BE SLOWED. FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE

REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION SERIES, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF

STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER.

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WITH RESPECT TO FILMS INTENDED FOR THEATRICAL RELEASE, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING

OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES (AND THEREFORE AFFECTING FUTURE FILM COST AMORTIZATION AND/OR IMPAIRMENT) IS DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. REVENUES DERIVED FROM OTHER MARKETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE DOMESTIC THEATRICAL RELEASE (E.G., THE HOME

ENTERTAINMENT OR INTERNATIONAL THEATRICAL MARKETS) HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE VARIES PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND DEMAND FOR A PARTICULAR FILM, THE

POPULARITY OF COMPETING FILMS AT THE TIME OF RELEASE AND THE LEVEL OF MARKETING EFFORT. UPON A FILMS RELEASE AND DETERMINATION OF DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF REVENUES FROM SUCCEEDING WINDOWS AND MARKETS ARE

REVISED BASED ON HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND AN ANALYSIS OF CURRENT MARKET TRENDS. THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR RELEASED FILMS IS THE EXTENT OF HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES ACHIEVED. HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES

VARY BASED ON THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF COMPETING HOME VIDEO PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE MANNER IN WHICH RETAILERS MARKET AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO TELEVISION SERIES OR OTHER TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS INTENDED FOR BROADCAST, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES IS THE PROGRAMS RATING AND THE STRENGTH

OF THE ADVERTISING MARKET. PROGRAM RATINGS, WHICH ARE AN INDICATION OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, DIRECTLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE ADVERTISING REVENUES DURING THE AIRING OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, TELEVISION SERIES WITH GREATER

MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUES THROUGH THE EVENTUAL SALE OF THE PROGRAM RIGHTS IN THE SYNDICATION, INTERNATIONAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKETS. ALTERNATIVELY, POOR RATINGS MAY RESULT IN A TELEVISION SERIES

CANCELLATION, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE IMMEDIATE WRITE-OFF OF ANY UNAMORTIZED PRODUCTION COSTS. A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE ADVERTISING MARKET WOULD ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ESTIMATES.

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE

PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. AMORTIZATION OF THOSE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ASSETS BEING AMORTIZED ON A NUMBER OF AIRINGS BASIS MAY BE ACCELERATED IF WE REDUCE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE

AIRINGS AND SLOWED IF WE INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS. THE NUMBER OF FUTURE AIRINGS OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY THE PROGRAMS RATINGS IN PREVIOUS AIRINGS, EXPECTED ADVERTISING RATES AND AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF

ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMMING. ACCORDINGLY, PLANNED USAGE IS REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND REVISED IF NECESSARY. WE AMORTIZE RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASONS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE OF

EACH YEAR IN THE ARRANGEMENT. THE ESTIMATED VALUES OF EACH YEAR ARE BASED ON OUR PROJECTION OF REVENUES OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD WHICH INCLUDE ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE REVENUE. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO

EACH SEASON APPROXIMATE EACH SEASONS RELATIVE VALUE, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. IF PLANNED USAGE PATTERNS OR ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUES BY YEAR WERE TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY, AMORTIZATION OF OUR

SPORTS RIGHTS COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED OR SLOWED.

COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR

RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS WHICH COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WITH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN

AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE: DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN, AND SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF

OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN-OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM. ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND

AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR PROJECTIONS, FILM, TELEVISION AND PROGRAMMING COST WRITE-DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ITS

VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH BUSINESS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THESE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES.

WE REDUCE HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND SOFTWARE PRODUCT REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED FUTURE RETURNS OF MERCHANDISE AND FOR CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND

SALES INCENTIVES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL RETURN EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS IN A PARTICULAR

PERIOD, WE MAY RECORD LESS REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS EXCEED THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT. CONVERSELY, IF WE OVERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS FOR A PERIOD, WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS AND

CONCESSIONS ARE LESS THAN ESTIMATED.

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED.

FOR NON-EXPIRING, MULTI-DAY TICKETS, REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED OVER A FOUR-YEAR TIME PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS. IF ACTUAL USAGE IS DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATED USAGE, REVENUES MAY NOT BE

RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIODS THE RELATED SERVICES ARE RENDERED. IN ADDITION, A CHANGE IN USAGE PATTERNS WOULD IMPACT THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

THE

COMPANYS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE CALCULATED USING A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT

ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY MEASUREMENT WHICH WE EVALUATE ANNUALLY. OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE AND EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS RETIREMENT PATTERNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER AND RATE OF COMPENSATION

INCREASE.

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE DISCOUNT RATE ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS FOR BENEFITS AS A

PRESENT VALUE ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE INCREASES THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES PENSION EXPENSE. THE GUIDELINE FOR SETTING THIS RATE IS A HIGH-QUALITY LONG-TERM CORPORATE BOND RATE. WE DECREASED OUR

DISCOUNT RATE TO 4.75% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2011 FROM 5.25% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2010 TO REFLECT MARKET INTEREST RATE CONDITIONS AT OUR OCTOBER 1, 2011 MEASUREMENT DATE. THIS DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WILL AFFECT NET PERIODIC PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE (BENEFIT EXPENSE) IN FISCAL 2012. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF

PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE

WOULD INCREASE TOTAL BENEFIT EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2012 BY $223 MILLION AND WOULD INCREASE THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT OCTOBER 1, 2011 BY $1.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD

DECREASE TOTAL BENEFIT EXPENSE AND THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $193 MILLION AND $1.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATION, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON EACH PLAN ASSET CLASS. A LOWER EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS

WILL INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE. OUR LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.75% FOR BOTH OF THE 2011 AND 2010 ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN THE LONG-TERM ASSET RETURN ASSUMPTION WOULD IMPACT FISCAL 2012 ANNUAL BENEFIT

EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $70 MILLION.

SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO TEST GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IF CURRENT

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE, ON AN INTERIM BASIS. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO

ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING

UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A

PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. WE APPLY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW ANALYSES ARE SENSITIVE TO OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARGINS FOR THESE BUSINESSES. WE INCLUDE IN THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUE WE BELIEVE THE REPORTING UNIT WOULD RECEIVE IF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

DEVELOPED BY THE REPORTING UNIT THAT IS BEING USED BY OTHER REPORTING UNITS WAS LICENSED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AT ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS THOSE INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS. WE BELIEVE OUR

ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE CONSISTENT WITH HOW A MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANT WOULD VALUE OUR REPORTING UNITS.

IN TIMES OF

ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A GREATER DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION

METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY TESTS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES (TRIGGERING EVENTS) INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ONCE A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST EMPLOYED IS BASED ON WHETHER THE INTENT IS TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR CONTINUED USE OR TO HOLD THE ASSET

FOR SALE. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR ASSETS HELD FOR USE REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET GROUP AGAINST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP. AN ASSET GROUP IS ESTABLISHED BY IDENTIFYING THE

LOWEST LEVEL OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY THE GROUP OF ASSETS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER ASSETS AND COULD INCLUDE ASSETS USED ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES OR SEGMENTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE

ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GROUPS LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GROUPS LONG-LIVED ASSETS. THE IMPAIRMENT IS ALLOCATED TO THE

LONG-LIVED ASSETS OF THE GROUP ON A PRO RATA BASIS USING THE RELATIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH ASSET IS ABOVE ITS FAIR VALUE. FOR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE

ASSETS FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE. DETERMINING WHETHER A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS IMPAIRED REQUIRES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING WHETHER A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE

IDENTIFICATION OF THE ASSET GROUPS, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUES. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT ASSET GROUPS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST

RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY HAS COST AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS

DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THESE INVESTMENTS, WE CONSIDER THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS THE FORECASTED

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEES AND MARKET VALUES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF THESE FORECASTS ARE NOT MET OR MARKET VALUES INDICATE AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.

DURING FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010, THE COMPANY TESTED ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR

IMPAIRMENT, AND THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED WERE IMMATERIAL. DURING FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $279 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED $142 MILLION FOR FCC RADIO LICENSES AND $65 MILLION FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN UTV. THE

FCC RADIO LICENSE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REFLECTED OVERALL MARKET DECLINES IN CERTAIN RADIO MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, WHICH WERE ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WERE RECORDED IN RESTRUCTURING AND

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

WE EVALUATE OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND ESTIMATE COLLECTABILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL BAD

DEBT EXPERIENCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. IN TIMES OF DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC TURMOIL, OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR

RECEIVABLES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER UNCERTAINTY THAN IN MORE STABLE PERIODS. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS IS TOO LOW, COSTS AND EXPENSES MAY INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND IF IT IS TOO HIGH, COST AND EXPENSES MAY DECREASE IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LOSSES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS. THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED

IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND ARE BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR

ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE PROCEEDINGS. SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.

INCOME TAX AUDITS

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. OUR DETERMINATIONS

REGARDING THE RECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX BENEFITS ARE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE TAX AND LEGAL COUNSEL WHERE APPROPRIATE AND ARE BASED UPON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF OUR TAX POSITIONS IN CONSIDERATION OF APPLICABLE TAX STATUTES AND RELATED

INTERPRETATIONS AND PRECEDENTS AND UPON THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF PROCEEDINGS (OR NEGOTIATIONS) WITH TAXING AND LEGAL AUTHORITIES. THE TAX BENEFITS ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY THE COMPANY MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE RECOGNIZED IN OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS DECISION TO SETTLE RATHER THAN LITIGATE A MATTER, RELEVANT LEGAL PRECEDENT RELATED TO SIMILAR MATTERS AND THE COMPANYS SUCCESS IN SUPPORTING ITS FILING POSITIONS WITH TAXING

AUTHORITIES.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE ON REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL YEAR. THE GUIDANCE REVISES THE CRITERIA FOR SEPARATING, MEASURING, AND ALLOCATING ARRANGEMENT

CONSIDERATION TO EACH DELIVERABLE IN A MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES COMPANIES TO ALLOCATE REVENUE USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE OF EACH DELIVERABLE, WHICH MUST BE ESTIMATED IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A HISTORY OF SELLING

THE DELIVERABLE ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS OR THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS GUIDANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, AND THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS TO ELIMINATE THE CONCEPT OF A QUALIFYING

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY, CHANGE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR OFF BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTING FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS INCLUDING LIMITING THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE OFF BALANCE SHEET TREATMENT FOR A PORTION OF A FINANCIAL ASSET IS ALLOWABLE, AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURES. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS GUIDANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, AND THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO REVISE THE APPROACH TO DETERMINE WHEN A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED. THE NEW CONSOLIDATION MODEL FOR VIES CONSIDERS WHETHER AN ENTITY

HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND SHARES IN THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND REWARDS OF THE VIE. THE GUIDANCE ON VIES REQUIRES COMPANIES TO CONTINUALLY REASSESS VIES TO DETERMINE

IF CONSOLIDATION IS APPROPRIATE AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS GUIDANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, AND THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CHANGES IN THAT FUNDED STATUS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR. THE GUIDANCE ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS

ALSO REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF THE FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE RECOGNITION PROVISION IN FISCAL YEAR 2007 WHICH RESULTED IN A $261 MILLION CHARGE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE

COMPANY ADOPTED THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISION BY REMEASURING PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2009. ADOPTION OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF $35 MILLION TO RETAINED EARNINGS AND A $100

MILLION BENEFIT TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE

COMPANY. WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE WRITTEN OR ORAL STATEMENTS THAT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING, INCLUDING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND IN REPORTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.

SUCH STATEMENTS MAY, FOR EXAMPLE, EXPRESS EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE ACTIONS THAT WE MAY TAKE, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING OR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, OR ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL INCLUDING CHANGES IN DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE MADE ON THE BASIS OF MANAGEMENTS VIEWS AND ASSUMPTIONS AS OF THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE THESE STATEMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS

WILL NECESSARILY COME TO PASS. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING THESE EXPECTATIONS ARE SET FORTH UNDER ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, AND THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE

OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN MINIMUM

AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF

EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW IN ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT

VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS, AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES

TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED, TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE PRINCIPAL FOREIGN CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN, AND

CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES OF ITS

FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES GENERALLY FOR PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED FOUR YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS ARE TO USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH

FLOWS ARISING FROM COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES. THE AMOUNTS HEDGED USING COMMODITY SWAP CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON FORECASTED LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES, SUCH AS FUEL OIL AND GASOLINE.

IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY OTHER HEDGING TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VALUE AT RISK (VAR)

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VAR MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL

ESTIMATES WERE MADE ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED IN A VAR COMPUTATION. THE COMPANYS COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS INTEREST

RATES, CURRENCIES, AND EQUITY PRICES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS WERE DETERMINED BY OBSERVING INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY, AND EQUITY MARKET CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING QUARTER FOR THE CALCULATION OF VAR AMOUNTS

AT FISCAL YEAR END. THE MODEL INCLUDES ALL OF THE COMPANYS DEBT AS WELL AS ALL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND RECEIVABLES AND

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH CERTAIN OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WILL BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN

MARKET FACTORS.

VAR ON A COMBINED BASIS INCREASED TO $58 MILLION AT OCTOBER 1, 2011 FROM $33 MILLION AT OCTOBER 2,

2010. THE INCREASE IN VAR PRIMARILY REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF FIXED RATE DEBT DURING THE YEAR AND HIGHER VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE, CALCULATED USING THE VAR MODEL, IS AS FOLLOWS (UNAUDITED, IN MILLIONS).

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY

AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO

FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL

OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE

TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON OUR EVALUATION UNDER THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK,

MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS

LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT OCTOBER 1, 2011 AND OCTOBER 2, 2010, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS

FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED OCTOBER 1, 2011 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS

AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK.

OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS IN 2009.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;

(II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING

MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS

ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE

OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE AMOUNTS RELATE TO INVESTMENTS AT CABLE NETWORKS.

BEGINNING FISCAL 2011, THE COMPANY MADE CHANGES TO CERTAIN TRANSFER PRICING ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN ITS

BUSINESS UNITS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS TO THE ALLOCATION OF HOME VIDEO REVENUE AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS BETWEEN THE MEDIA NETWORKS AND STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENTS FOR HOME VIDEO TITLES PRODUCED BY THE MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT AND DISTRIBUTED

BY THE STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT. THESE CHANGES WILL GENERALLY RESULT IN HIGHER REVENUES, EXPENSES AND OPERATING INCOME AT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT WITH OFFSETTING DECLINES AT OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT.

THE FOLLOWING SEGMENT RESULTS INCLUDE ALLOCATIONS OF CERTAIN COSTS, INCLUDING INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, PENSION, LEGAL, AND OTHER SHARED

SERVICES COSTS, WHICH ARE ALLOCATED BASED ON METRICS DESIGNED TO CORRELATE WITH CONSUMPTION. THESE ALLOCATIONS ARE AGREED-UPON AMOUNTS BETWEEN THE BUSINESSES AND MAY DIFFER FROM AMOUNTS THAT WOULD BE NEGOTIATED IN ARMS LENGTH TRANSACTIONS. IN

ADDITION, ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERSEGMENT TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED EXCEPT THAT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT REVENUES AND OPERATING INCOME INCLUDE AN ALLOCATION OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND INTERACTIVE MEDIA REVENUES, WHICH IS MEANT TO REFLECT ROYALTIES ON

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS MAJORITY-OWNED AND CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN

ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. IN DECEMBER 1999, DVD FINANCING, INC. (DFI), A SUBSIDIARY OF DISNEY VACATION DEVELOPMENT, INC. AND AN INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, COMPLETED A RECEIVABLES SALE TRANSACTION THAT ESTABLISHED A FACILITY THAT

PERMITTED DFI TO SELL RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE SALE OF VACATION CLUB MEMBERSHIPS ON A PERIODIC BASIS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS FACILITY, DFI PREPARES SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH ITS SEPARATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE ALSO

CONSOLIDATED IN THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. DFIS ABILITY TO SELL NEW RECEIVABLES UNDER THIS FACILITY ENDED ON DECEMBER 4, 2008. (SEE NOTE 16 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS FACILITY)

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO RELATIONSHIPS OR INVESTMENTS WITH OTHER ENTITIES, AND IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE ENTITY IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A

RELATIONSHIP OR INVESTMENT MAY QUALIFY AS A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE). A VIE IS CONSOLIDATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF THE COMPANY HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF

THE VIE AND HAS THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE. DISNEYLAND PARIS, HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT AND SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT ARE VIES, AND GIVEN THE NATURE

OF THE COMPANYS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE ENTITIES, WHICH INCLUDE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS CONSOLIDATED DISNEYLAND PARIS, HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT AND SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

PRESENTATION.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND FOOTNOTES THERETO. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

BROADCAST ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN COMMERCIALS ARE AIRED. REVENUES FROM TELEVISION SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS PRIMARY CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CONTRACTS WITH CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS INCLUDE ANNUAL LIVE PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS. IN THESE CASES, RECOGNITION OF

REVENUES SUBJECT TO THE COMMITMENTS IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE ANNUAL COMMITMENTS ARE SATISFIED, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. FOR NON-EXPIRING, MULTI-DAY TICKETS, REVENUES ARE

RECOGNIZED OVER A FOUR-YEAR TIME PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS.

MERCHANDISE LICENSING ADVANCES AND GUARANTEE ROYALTY PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL ROYALTY RATE WHEN THE LICENSED

PRODUCT IS SOLD BY THE LICENSEE. NON-REFUNDABLE ADVANCES AND MINIMUM GUARANTEE ROYALTY PAYMENTS IN EXCESS OF ROYALTIES EARNED ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AT THE END OF THE CONTRACT TERM.

REVENUES FROM OUR INTERNET AND MOBILE OPERATIONS ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED. ADVERTISING REVENUES AT OUR INTERNET OPERATIONS

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS TO RESERVE FOR POTENTIALLY UNCOLLECTIBLE RECEIVABLES. THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL

ACCOUNTS IS ESTIMATED BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF TRENDS IN OVERALL RECEIVABLES AGING, SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION OF CERTAIN RECEIVABLES THAT ARE AT RISK OF NOT BEING PAID, PAST COLLECTION EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS. IN TIMES OF DOMESTIC OR

GLOBAL ECONOMIC TURMOIL, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS RECEIVABLES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER UNCERTAINTY THAN IN MORE STABLE PERIODS.

ADVERTISING EXPENSE

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

EARNINGS OR ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS), RESPECTIVELY. ALL OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING EITHER THE COST METHOD OR THE EQUITY METHOD.

THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW THE COST BASIS IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. IF THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY, THE COST BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE.

TRANSLATION POLICY

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

FOR DISNEYLAND PARIS, HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT, SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT AND INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS OF THE DISNEY STORES.

AVERAGE COST BASIS AND ARE RECORDED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS INCLUDE CAPITALIZABLE PRODUCTION COSTS, PRODUCTION OVERHEAD, INTEREST, DEVELOPMENT COSTS, AND ACQUIRED

PRODUCTION COSTS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR FAIR VALUE. ACQUIRED PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR THE COMPANYS TELEVISION AND CABLE NETWORKS ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR

NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ACQUIRED TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE RECORDED WHEN THE LICENSE PERIOD BEGINS AND THE PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE FOR USE. MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION, PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS ARE EXPENSED OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED

UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS REVENUES TO ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FOR EACH PRODUCTION. FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM

THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION SERIES, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT

EPISODE, IF LATER. FOR ACQUIRED FILM LIBRARIES, REMAINING REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO BE EARNED FOR UP TO TWENTY YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS WHICH

COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WITH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS EXCEED THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES IS WRITTEN OFF. FILM DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN

ABANDONED OR HAVE NOT BEEN SET FOR PRODUCTION WITHIN THREE YEARS ARE GENERALLY WRITTEN OFF.

THE COSTS OF TELEVISION BROADCAST

ARRANGEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASONS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE OF EACH YEAR IN THE ARRANGEMENT. THE ESTIMATED VALUES OF EACH YEAR ARE BASED ON OUR PROJECTIONS OF REVENUES OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD WHICH INCLUDE

ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE REVENUE. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON APPROXIMATE EACH SEASONS RELATIVE VALUE, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. INDIVIDUAL

PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM.

71

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF NETWORK TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE

REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE: DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN, AND

SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL.

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE COSTS

THE COMPANY EXPENSES COSTS INCURRED IN THE

PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE OF DEVELOPING OR ACQUIRING INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE, SUCH AS RESEARCH AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES, AS WELL AS COSTS INCURRED IN THE POST-IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONAL STAGE, SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING. CAPITALIZATION OF

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OCCURS ONLY AFTER THE PRELIMINARY-PROJECT STAGE IS COMPLETE, MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZES THE PROJECT, AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETED AND THE SOFTWARE WILL BE USED FOR THE FUNCTION INTENDED. AS OF

OCTOBER 1, 2011 AND OCTOBER 2, 2010, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS, NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION, TOTALED $486 MILLION AND $476 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE, RANGING FROM 3-10 YEARS.

GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO TEST GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IF CURRENT

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE, ON AN INTERIM BASIS. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO

ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING

UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A

PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. WE APPLY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. WE INCLUDE IN THE

PROJECTED CASH FLOWS AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUE WE BELIEVE THE REPORTING UNIT WOULD RECEIVE IF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE REPORTING UNIT THAT IS BEING USED BY OTHER REPORTING UNITS WAS LICENSED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AT ITS FAIR

MARKET VALUE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS THOSE INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS.

IN TIMES OF ADVERSE

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A GREATER DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR

ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY IS

REQUIRED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.

72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY TESTS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR IMPAIRMENT

WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (TRIGGERING EVENTS) INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ONCE A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST EMPLOYED IS BASED ON WHETHER THE INTENT IS TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR

CONTINUED USE OR TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR SALE. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR ASSETS HELD FOR USE REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET GROUP AGAINST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP. AN ASSET

GROUP IS ESTABLISHED BY IDENTIFYING THE LOWEST LEVEL OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY A GROUP OF ASSETS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER ASSETS AND COULD INCLUDE ASSETS USED ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES OR SEGMENTS. IF THE CARRYING

VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GROUPS LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GROUPS LONG-LIVED

ASSETS. THE IMPAIRMENT IS ALLOCATED TO THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OF THE GROUP ON A PRO RATA BASIS USING THE RELATIVE CARRYING AMOUNT, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH ASSET IS ABOVE ITS FAIR VALUE. FOR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, TO THE

EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE ASSETS FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE.

DURING FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010, THE COMPANY TESTED ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT, AND THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED WERE NOT MATERIAL. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2009, THE COMPANY

RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $142 MILLION RELATED TO FCC RADIO LICENSES AND A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TOTALING $29 MILLION. THE FCC RADIO LICENSE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REFLECTED OVERALL MARKET DECLINES IN CERTAIN RADIO MARKETS IN WHICH WE

OPERATE. THE FCC RADIO LICENSE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, WHICH WERE DETERMINED BASED ON A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WERE RECORDED IN RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER PERIODS UP TO 40 YEARS. THE COSTS TO PERIODICALLY

RENEW OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO LEGAL, COMPETITIVE, ECONOMIC OR OTHER FACTORS THAT MATERIALLY LIMIT THE USEFUL LIFE OF OUR FCC LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS AGGREGATE ANNUAL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR EXISTING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2012 THROUGH

2016 TO BE AS FOLLOWS.

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND INVESTMENTS IN

EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS, AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS.

THE

COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR UNDERTAKING VARIOUS HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DERIVATIVES INTO WHICH THE COMPANY

ENTERS: HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AND HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE. HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED ASSET, LIABILITY, OR A FIRM COMMITMENT. HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED

INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION (E.G. FORECASTED REVENUE) OR THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED, RELATED TO A RECOGNIZED LIABILITY OR ASSET (E.G. FLOATING RATE DEBT).

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES AND ASSIGNS THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFIC ASSETS OR SPECIFIC

LIABILITIES. WHEN HEDGED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE SOLD OR EXTINGUISHED OR THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

OPTION PREMIUMS AND UNREALIZED GAINS ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE

RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS OTHER ASSETS. UNREALIZED LOSSES ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN

LIABILITIES. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES THE DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID

OR RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS AS INTEREST RATES AND EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIVES OF THE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE TERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE SWAP AGREEMENTS, PRIOR TO THEIR ORIGINAL MATURITY, ARE

DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS.

73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND DO

NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THESE CONTRACTS ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET CERTAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURES OF THE COMPANY AND ARE CARRIED AT MARKET VALUE WITH ANY CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (SEE NOTES 9 AND 17).

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED WITH RESPECT TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IN THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF ITEMS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. WHERE, BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, IT

IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME AMOUNT OF RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE AMOUNT THAT, IN MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, IS SUFFICIENT TO REDUCE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET TO AN AMOUNT THAT

IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

A TAX POSITION MUST MEET A MINIMUM PROBABILITY THRESHOLD BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT

BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES,

BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

THE

COMPANY PRESENTS BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AMOUNTS. BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DISNEY BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EPS IS BASED UPON

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR, WHICH IS CALCULATED USING THE TREASURY-STOCK METHOD FOR EQUITY-BASED AWARDS (AWARDS). COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION IN

PERIODS FOR WHICH THEY HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT. STOCK OPTIONS FOR WHICH THE EXERCISE PRICE EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OVER THE PERIOD ARE ANTI-DILUTIVE AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION.

A RECONCILIATION OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING AND THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXCLUDED FROM

THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION, AS THEY WERE ANTI-DILUTIVE, ARE AS FOLLOWS.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE ON REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL YEAR. THE GUIDANCE REVISES

THE CRITERIA FOR SEPARATING, MEASURING, AND ALLOCATING ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION TO EACH DELIVERABLE IN A MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES COMPANIES TO ALLOCATE REVENUE USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE OF EACH DELIVERABLE, WHICH

MUST BE ESTIMATED IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A HISTORY OF SELLING THE DELIVERABLE ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS OR THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS GUIDANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, AND THE

ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS TO ELIMINATE THE CONCEPT OF A

QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY, CHANGE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR OFF BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTING FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS INCLUDING LIMITING THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE OFF BALANCE SHEET TREATMENT FOR A PORTION OF A FINANCIAL ASSET IS ALLOWABLE, AND REQUIRE

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS GUIDANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, AND THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO REVISE THE APPROACH TO DETERMINE WHEN A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED. THE NEW CONSOLIDATION MODEL FOR VIES CONSIDERS WHETHER AN ENTITY

HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT A VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND SHARES IN THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND REWARDS OF THE VIE. THE GUIDANCE ON VIES REQUIRES COMPANIES TO CONTINUALLY REASSESS VIES TO DETERMINE IF

CONSOLIDATION IS APPROPRIATE AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THIS GUIDANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, AND THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN THE

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CHANGES IN THAT FUNDED STATUS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR. THE GUIDANCE ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS ALSO REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF THE FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN AS OF THE

END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE RECOGNITION PROVISION IN FISCAL YEAR 2007 WHICH RESULTED IN A $261 MILLION CHARGE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISION BY REMEASURING PLAN

ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2009. ADOPTION OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF $35 MILLION TO RETAINED EARNINGS AND A $100 MILLION BENEFIT TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2009 WERE 7.80% FOR THE

DISCOUNT RATE, 7.50% FOR THE RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, AND 5.00% FOR SALARY INCREASES. BASED ON THIS MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS FOR FISCAL 2009 WERE $214 MILLION.

ACQUISITIONS

UTH RUSSIA LIMITED

ON NOVEMBER 18, 2011, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A 49% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE SEVEN TV NETWORK FROM UTH RUSSIA LIMITED (UTH) FOR $300 MILLION. THE SEVEN TV NETWORK WILL BE CONVERTED TO AN AD-SUPPORTED,

FREE-TO-AIR DISNEY CHANNEL IN RUSSIA.

UTV

ON MAY 9, 2008, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A 24% INTEREST (BRINGING ITS UNDILUTED INTEREST TO 37%) IN UTV SOFTWARE COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED (UTV), A MEDIA COMPANY HEADQUARTERED AND PUBLICLY TRADED IN INDIA,

FOR APPROXIMATELY $197 MILLION. IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDIAN SECURITIES REGULATIONS, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE AN OPEN TENDER OFFER TO PURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 23% OF UTVS PUBLICLY TRADED VOTING SHARES FOR A PRICE EQUIVALENT TO

THE MAY 9TH, 2008 INDIAN RUPEE PURCHASE PRICE. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE OPEN OFFER AND ACQUIRED AN INCREMENTAL 23% OF UTVS VOTING SHARES FOR APPROXIMATELY $138 MILLION BRINGING ITS UNDILUTED INTEREST TO 60%. UTVS

FOUNDER HAS A FOUR-YEAR OPTION WHICH EXPIRES IN NOVEMBER 2012 TO BUY ALL OR A PORTION OF THE SHARES ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE OPEN-OFFER PERIOD AT A PRICE NO LESS THAN THE COMPANYS OPEN-OFFER PRICE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT

TO VOTE THE SHARES SUBJECT TO THE OPTION UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE OPTION AND ACCORDINGLY THE COMPANYS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN VOTING SHARES WAS 48%. IN JANUARY 2010, UTV ISSUED ADDITIONAL SHARES IN EXCHANGE FOR THE OUTSTANDING NONCONTROLLING

INTEREST OF ONE OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES DILUTING THE COMPANYS DIRECT INTEREST IN UTV TO 50% (39% VOTING INTEREST).

IN

FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY WROTE DOWN ITS INVESTMENT IN UTV TO FAIR VALUE AND RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TOTALING $65 MILLION. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN UTV WAS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL

VALUATION OF THE UTV BUSINESS USING AN INCOME APPROACH (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL). THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE PRINCIPAL MARKET FOR ITS LONG-TERM STRATEGIC INVESTMENT IN UTV WOULD BE A PRIVATELY NEGOTIATED TRANSACTION WITH ANOTHER STRATEGIC INVESTOR

AND THAT THE PARTICIPANTS IN THIS MARKET WOULD VALUE THIS INVESTMENT USING THE INCOME APPROACH. ACCORDINGLY, THE INCOME APPROACH PROVIDED THE MOST APPROPRIATE INDICATOR OF FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN UTV RATHER THAN THE PRICE OF

INDIVIDUAL SHARES TRADED ON INDIAN STOCK EXCHANGES.

ON JULY 25, 2011, THE UTV BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A PROPOSAL

SUBMITTED BY THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE THE PUBLICLY HELD SHARES OF UTV THROUGH A DELISTING OFFER PROCESS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE UTV SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED THE DELISTING OF UTVS EQUITY SHARES FROM THE INDIAN STOCK EXCHANGES. THE DELISTING PROCESS IS

GOVERNED BY INDIAN LAW AND WILL, IF COMPLETED, INVOLVE AN OFFER BY THE COMPANY TO ACQUIRE SHARES PUBLICLY TRADED ON THE INDIAN STOCK EXCHANGES AT A PRICE DETERMINED THROUGH THE OFFER PROCESS. THE FINAL OFFER PRICE IS SUBJECT TO THE COMPANYS

ACCEPTANCE AND IS CURRENTLY LIMITED IN THE COMPANYS PROPOSAL TO 1,000 INDIAN RUPEES PER SHARE. THE COMPANYS PROPOSAL ALSO CONTEMPLATES THE PURCHASE OF ALL SHARES HELD BY THE FOUNDER OF UTV, WHICH CONSTITUTE 20% OF UTV, AT THE FINAL OFFER

PRICE. THE FOUNDERS SHARES AND THE PUBLICLY HELD SHARES CONSTITUTE ALL THE UTV SHARES THAT THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY OWN. THE TRANSACTION IS SUBJECT TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, INDIAN REGULATORY APPROVAL AND THE COMPANYS ACCEPTANCE OF

THE PRICE PER SHARE THAT RESULTS FROM THE DELISTING OFFER PROCESS. IF COMPLETED, THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN UTV WOULD INCREASE TO AT LEAST 90% AND RESULT IN A DELISTING OF UTVS SHARES.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION OF UP TO $200 MILLION MAY BE PAID IF PLAYDOM ACHIEVES PREDEFINED REVENUES AND EARNINGS TARGETS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2012. THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED THE FAIR VALUE (DETERMINED BY A PROBABILITY WEIGHTING OF

THE DISNEY STORE JAPAN

ON MARCH 31, 2010, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF RETAIL NETWORKS COMPANY LIMITED (THE DISNEY STORE JAPAN) IN

STRATEGIC VALUE CREATION THROUGH UTILIZATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES ACROSS DISNEYS MULTIPLE PLATFORMS AND TERRITORIES.

(AETN) IN EXCHANGE FOR AN INCREASED INTEREST IN AETN. PRIOR TO THIS TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY AND HEARST EACH HELD 37.5% OF AETN WHILE NBC UNIVERSAL (NBCU) HELD 25%. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR THE TRANSACTION AS A SALE OF A PORTION OF ITS INTEREST IN

CERTAIN INDIRECT, WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY HAVE LIABILITY AS

CURRENT OR FORMER GENERAL PARTNERS OF DISNEY S.C.A. IN ADDITION TO THEIR EQUITY INTEREST IN DISNEY S.C.A., CERTAIN OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN CAPITALIZED WITH INTEREST-BEARING DEMAND NOTES WITH AN AGGREGATE FACE VALUE OF

200 MILLION. IN ADDITION, INTEREST OF 41 MILLION HAS ACCRUED ON THE NOTES FROM THE DATE OF ISSUANCE AND HAS BEEN ADDED TO THE AMOUNT OWED.

HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT CAPITAL REALIGNMENT

IN JULY 2009, THE COMPANY

ENTERED INTO A CAPITAL REALIGNMENT AND EXPANSION PLAN FOR HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT (HKDL) WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION (HKSAR), HKDLS MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER. KEY PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN INCLUDE.



THE COMPANY CONVERTED ITS $354 MILLION TERM AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY LOAN TO HKDL INTO EQUITY DURING FISCAL 2009. THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY

CONVERSION OF AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF THE HKSAR LOAN TO HKDL INTO EQUITY



THE COMPANY WOULD MAKE APPROXIMATELY $0.4 BILLION OF EQUITY CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUND HKDL DURING THE EXPANSION, WHICH IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO BE

COMPLETED IN PHASES BY 2013. THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF EQUITY CONTRIBUTIONS BY THE COMPANY MAY DIFFER DEPENDING ON THE ACTUAL FINAL COST OF THE EXPANSION AND OPERATING RESULTS OF HKDL DURING THE RELEVANT TIMEFRAME. THE HKSAR WILL CONVERT AN ADDITIONAL

AMOUNT OF ITS LOAN TO HKDL EQUAL TO THESE CONTRIBUTIONS INTO EQUITY, SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM CONVERSION AMOUNT THAT WOULD LEAVE APPROXIMATELY HK $1.0 BILLION ($128 MILLION AT OCTOBER 1, 2011 EXCHANGE RATES) OF THE HKSAR LOAN TO HKDL OUTSTANDING.

AT OCTOBER 1, 2011, THE HKSAR LOAN TO HKDL WAS $330 MILLION. DURING FISCAL 2011, 2010 AND 2009, THE COMPANY MADE EQUITY CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $153 MILLION, $66 MILLION AND $40 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE ARRANGEMENT, THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN HKDL HAS INCREASED FROM 43% TO 47% AND IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE TO

APPROXIMATELY 48% ALTHOUGH THE COMPANYS ENDING OWNERSHIP WILL DEPEND ON THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF EQUITY CONTRIBUTIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY PURSUANT TO THE EXPANSION PLAN.

SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT

ON APRIL 8, 2011, THE COMPANY AND SHANGHAI

SHENDI (GROUP) CO., LTD (SHENDI) ANNOUNCED THAT THE CHINESE CENTRAL GOVERNMENT IN BEIJING HAD APPROVED AN AGREEMENT TO BUILD AND OPERATE A DISNEY RESORT IN THE PUDONG DISTRICT OF SHANGHAI (SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT) THAT IS OPERATED THROUGH A JOINT

VENTURE BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND SHENDI, IN WHICH SHENDI OWNS A 57% INTEREST AND THE COMPANY OWNS 43%. SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT IS SCHEDULED TO OPEN IN APPROXIMATELY FIVE YEARS. THE PROJECT WILL BE CONSTRUCTED IN PHASES, AND WE EXPECT THE TOTAL

INVESTMENT TO BE APPROXIMATELY 24.5 BILLION YUAN TO BUILD THE THEME PARK AND AN ADDITIONAL 4.5 BILLION YUAN TO BUILD OTHER ASPECTS OF THE RESORT, INCLUDING TWO HOTELS AND A RETAIL, DINING AND ENTERTAINMENT AREA. THE COMPANY WILL FINANCE 43% OF THE

INITIAL INVESTMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS EQUITY OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE. THE COMPANY CONSOLIDATES SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES DUE TO THE COMPANYS INVOLVEMENT IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE RESORT.

THE COMPANY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL U.S. INCOME TAXES. ASSUMING THE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED FOREIGN EARNINGS WERE REPATRIATED UNDER LAWS AND RATES APPLICABLE AT 2011 FISCAL YEAR END, THE INCREMENTAL U.S. TAX APPLICABLE TO THE EARNINGS WOULD BE

APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION.

THE

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

MADE A NUMBER OF CHANGES TO THE INCOME TAX LAWS INCLUDING

THE CREATION OF A DEDUCTION FOR QUALIFYING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE DEDUCTION EQUALS THREE PERCENT OF QUALIFYING NET INCOME FOR FISCAL 2007, SIX PERCENT FOR FISCAL 2008 THROUGH 2010, AND NINE PERCENT FOR FISCAL 2011 AND THEREAFTER. OUR

TAX PROVISIONS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2011, 2010, AND 2009 REFLECT BENEFITS OF $183 MILLION, $111 MILLION AND $100 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING FROM THIS DEDUCTION.

A RECONCILIATION OF THE BEGINNING AND ENDING AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, EXCLUDING THE RELATED ACCRUAL FOR INTEREST, IS AS FOLLOWS.

THE YEAR END 2011 AND 2010 BALANCES INCLUDE $480 MILLION AND $473 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, THAT IF

RECOGNIZED, WOULD REDUCE OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NET OF THE OFFSETTING BENEFITS FROM OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS.

AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2011 AND 2010, THE COMPANY HAD $175 MILLION AND $163 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. DURING 2011, 2010 AND 2009, THE

COMPANY ACCRUED ADDITIONAL INTEREST OF $17 MILLION, $28 MILLION AND $27 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND RECORDED REDUCTIONS IN ACCRUED INTEREST OF $13 MILLION, $7 MILLION AND $12 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS A RESULT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS AND OTHER

PRIOR-YEAR ADJUSTMENTS. THE COMPANYS POLICY IS TO REPORT INTEREST AND PENALTIES AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

DURING THE CURRENT YEAR, THE COMPANY RESOLVED VARIOUS REFUND CLAIMS AND OTHER MATTERS WITH TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT

TO U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX AUDITS. THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL EXAMINATION FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2008. THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION IN ANY OF ITS MAJOR STATE OR FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS FOR

YEARS PRIOR TO 2003.

IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD CHANGE DUE

TO THE RESOLUTION OF TAX MATTERS, INCLUDING PAYMENTS ON THE TAX MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THESE RESOLUTIONS AND PAYMENTS COULD REDUCE OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS BY $93 MILLION.

IN FISCAL 2011 AND 2010, INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS EXCEEDED THE AMOUNTS RECORDED BASED

ON GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, $109 MILLION AND $61 MILLION WERE CREDITED TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, RESPECTIVELY IN THESE YEARS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2009, INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS WERE LESS

THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED AT GRANT DATE AND A SHORTFALL OF $26 MILLION WAS CHARGED TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PROGRAMS

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS COVERING MOST OF ITS EMPLOYEES NOT COVERED BY

UNION OR INDUSTRY-WIDE PLANS. EMPLOYEES GENERALLY HIRED AFTER JANUARY 1, 1994 AND EMPLOYEES GENERALLY HIRED AFTER JANUARY 1, 1987 FOR CERTAIN OF OUR MEDIA BUSINESSES ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. WITH RESPECT TO ITS

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, THE COMPANYS POLICY IS TO FUND, AT A MINIMUM, THE AMOUNT NECESSARY ON AN ACTUARIAL BASIS TO PROVIDE FOR BENEFITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS

AMENDED BY THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 (PPA). PENSION BENEFITS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND/OR COMPENSATION.

IN FISCAL 2011, THE COMPANY SUBSTANTIALLY AMENDED ITS SALARIED EMPLOYEES PENSION PLANS WITH RESPECT TO BENEFITS EARNED FOR SERVICE AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2011. THE COMPANY REDUCED THE VESTING REQUIREMENT FROM

FIVE YEARS OF VESTING SERVICE TO THREE YEARS OF VESTING SERVICE, REVISED THE EARLY RETIREMENT REDUCTION FACTORS AND EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES HIRED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2011 FROM PLAN PARTICIPATION. IN ADDITION, THE PERCENTAGE OF AVERAGE MONTHLY

COMPENSATION ON WHICH SALARY-RELATED BENEFITS ARE BASED WAS REDUCED WHILE OVERTIME, COMMISSIONS AND REGULAR BONUS AMOUNTS WERE ADDED TO THE CALCULATION OF AVERAGE MONTHLY COMPENSATION RECEIVED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2011 TO THE EXTENT THOSE ELEMENTS OF

COMPENSATION WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED. THESE AMENDMENTS WILL REDUCE FISCAL 2012 EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO PROVIDE BENEFITS UNDER NEW DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS FOR EMPLOYEES WHO BEGIN SERVICE AFTER

DECEMBER 31, 2011.

THE FOLLOWING CHART SUMMARIZES THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, ASSETS, FUNDED STATUS AND BALANCE SHEET

PLAN ASSETS

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE MANAGED ON A COMMINGLED BASIS IN A THIRD PARTY MASTER TRUST. THE INVESTMENT POLICY AND ALLOCATION OF THE ASSETS IN THE

MASTER TRUST WERE APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE WHICH HAS OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMPANYS RETIREMENT PLANS. THE INVESTMENT POLICY RANGES FOR THE MAJOR ASSET CLASSES ARE AS FOLLOWS.

THE PRIMARY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE FOR THE ASSETS WITHIN THE MASTER TRUST IS TO PRUDENTLY AND COST

EFFECTIVELY MANAGE ASSETS TO FULFILL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. FINANCIAL RISKS ARE MANAGED THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION OF PLAN ASSETS, SELECTION OF INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND THROUGH THE INVESTMENT GUIDELINES INCORPORATED INTO INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. ASSETS ARE MONITORED TO ENSURE THAT INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE COMMENSURATE WITH RISKS TAKEN.

THE

LONG-TERM ASSET ALLOCATION POLICY FOR THE MASTER TRUST WAS ESTABLISHED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE AVERAGE AGE OF PARTICIPANTS, THE NUMBER OF RETIREES, THE DURATION OF LIABILITIES AND THE

EXPECTED PAYOUT RATIO. LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF THE MASTER TRUST ARE GENERALLY MANAGED USING CASH GENERATED BY INVESTMENTS OR BY LIQUIDATING SECURITIES.

ASSETS ARE GENERALLY MANAGED BY EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND WE HAVE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO SECURITIES IN THE MASTER TRUST. THESE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE ACCOUNT GUIDELINES THAT

ESTABLISH PERMITTED SECURITIES AND RISK CONTROLS COMMENSURATE WITH THE ACCOUNTS INVESTMENT STRATEGY. SOME AGREEMENTS PERMIT THE USE OF DERIVATIVE SECURITIES (FUTURES, OPTIONS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS) THAT ENABLE INVESTMENT

MANAGERS TO ENHANCE RETURNS AND MANAGE EXPOSURES WITHIN THEIR ACCOUNTS. INVESTMENT MANAGERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM USING DERIVATIVES TO LEVERAGE RETURNS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF PLAN ASSETS

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FOR SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION

BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. THE COMPANYS DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES.



LEVEL 1  QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS



LEVEL 2  QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT

ACTIVE; AND MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS IN WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS AND SIGNIFICANT VALUE DRIVERS ARE OBSERVABLE IN ACTIVE MARKETS



LEVEL 3  VALUATIONS DERIVED FROM VALUATION TECHNIQUES IN WHICH ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS OR SIGNIFICANT VALUE DRIVERS ARE UNOBSERVABLE

FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED FOR ASSETS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. THERE

HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE METHODOLOGIES USED AT OCTOBER 1, 2011 AND OCTOBER 2, 2010.

LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS ARE

VALUED BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE YEAR. INVESTMENTS IN COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS ARE VALUED BASED ON THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE-LISTED PRICE OR A BROKERS QUOTE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET. INVESTMENTS IN U.S.

TREASURY SECURITIES ARE VALUED BASED ON A BROKERS QUOTE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET.

LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED AT

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AT YEAR-END. INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY BONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AND CORPORATE BONDS ARE VALUED USING A BROKERS QUOTE IN A NON-ACTIVE MARKET OR AN EVALUATED PRICE BASED

ON A COMPILATION OF OBSERVABLE MARKET INFORMATION, SUCH AS BENCHMARK YIELD CURVES, CREDIT SPREADS AND ESTIMATED DEFAULT RATES. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE VALUED BASED ON MODELS THAT INCORPORATE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE UNDERLYING

SECURITIES, SUCH AS INTEREST RATES. SHARES IN MONEY MARKET AND MUTUAL FUNDS ARE VALUED AT THE NET ASSET VALUE OF THE SHARES HELD BY THE PLAN AT YEAR-END BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS.

LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF INVESTMENTS IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, WHICH ARE VALUED BASED ON THE MASTER TRUSTS PRO-RATA

SHARE OF PARTNERSHIP HOLDINGS AS OF YEAR-END. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS ARE ESTIMATED USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (E.G., DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS OR RELATIVE VALUATION METHODS THAT INCORPORATE COMPARABLE MARKET

INFORMATION SUCH AS EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW MULTIPLES FROM SIMILAR PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES OR REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES).

UNCALLED CAPITAL COMMITMENTS

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE MASTER TRUST INCLUDE INTERESTS IN CERTAIN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT HAVE RIGHTS TO MAKE CAPITAL CALLS TO THE LIMITED PARTNER INVESTORS. IN SUCH CASES, THE MASTER TRUST

WOULD BE CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO MAKE A CASH CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AT THE TIME OF A CAPITAL CALL. AT OCTOBER 1, 2011, THE TOTAL COMMITTED CAPITAL STILL UNCALLED AND UNPAID WAS $462 MILLION.

PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS

DURING FISCAL 2011, THE COMPANY MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS TOTALING $935 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED

DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS IN FISCAL 2012 TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $325 MILLION TO $375 MILLION. FINAL MINIMUM

FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR FISCAL 2012 WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON OUR JANUARY 1, 2012 FUNDING ACTUARIAL VALUATION WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE IN LATE FISCAL 2012.

ASSUMPTIONS

ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS THE DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE, HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST AS WELL AS THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

DISCOUNT RATE

 THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE FOR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS REFLECTS THE MARKET RATES

FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE

REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

 THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM RETURNS ON AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTING OF A MIXTURE OF EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS. WHEN DETERMINING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS

LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON THE ASSET CLASSES (BOTH HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED) IN WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE PENSION FUNDS TO BE INVESTED. THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN BY ASSET CLASS WERE CONSIDERED IN SETTING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION.

HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE

 THE COMPANY REVIEWS EXTERNAL DATA AND ITS OWN HISTORICAL TRENDS

FOR HEALTHCARE COSTS TO DETERMINE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATES FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS. FOR THE 2011 ACTUARIAL VALUATION, WE ASSUMED AN 8.00% ANNUAL RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE CLAIMS WITH

THE RATE DECREASING IN EVEN INCREMENTS OVER FOURTEEN YEARS UNTIL REACHING 4.50%.

EQUITY-BASED

COMPENSATION

UNDER VARIOUS PLANS, THE COMPANY MAY GRANT STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY-BASED AWARDS TO EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT, AND

CREATIVE PERSONNEL. THE COMPANYS APPROACH TO LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION CONTEMPLATES AWARDS OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS). CERTAIN RSUS AWARDED TO SENIOR EXECUTIVES VEST BASED UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF MARKET AND/OR

PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS (PERFORMANCE RSUS).

STOCK OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY GRANTED AT EXERCISE PRICES EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING THE

MARKET PRICE AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND BECOME EXERCISABLE RATABLY OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE GRANT DATE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR OUR STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

STOCK OPTION AWARD REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE BY ONE SHARE WHILE EACH SHARE GRANTED SUBJECT TO A RSU AWARD REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE BY TWO SHARES. THE COMPANY SATISFIES STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF RSUS WITH NEWLY

ISSUED SHARES. STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS ARE GENERALLY FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES WHO TERMINATE PRIOR TO VESTING.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EACH YEAR, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY AWARDS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS TO A BROAD-BASED GROUP OF MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL (THE ANNUAL GRANT). THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS VOLATILITY,

DIVIDEND YIELD, AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE (THE MULTIPLE OF EXERCISE PRICE TO GRANT PRICE AT WHICH EXERCISES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON AVERAGE) AND THE TERMINATION RATE

(THE PROBABILITY OF A VESTED OPTION BEING CANCELLED DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE OPTION HOLDER) IN COMPUTING THE VALUE OF THE OPTION.

IN FISCAL YEARS 2011, 2010 AND 2009, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OPTION-VALUATION MODEL WERE AS FOLLOWS.

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS NOT ADJUSTED AFTER THE GRANT DATE, CHANGES IN THE

COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE THE VALUE OF, AND THEREFORE THE EXPENSE RELATED TO, FUTURE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE GREATEST VARIATION IN FAIR VALUE IN THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ARE THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND

EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN EITHER THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE WILL CAUSE THE BINOMIAL OPTION VALUE TO INCREASE OR DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION CONSIDERS BOTH HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS WELL

AS CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS AND STOCK OPTIONS IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE

SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS IS BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE AWARDS ON THE GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR PERFORMANCE RSUS REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITY THAT THE MARKET AND/OR

PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS WILL BE MET. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2010, EQUITY-BASED AWARDS PROVIDE CONTINUED VESTING, IN THE EVENT OF TERMINATION, GENERALLY FOR EMPLOYEES THAT REACH AGE 60 OR GREATER, HAVE AT LEAST TEN YEARS OF SERVICE AND HOLD THE AWARD FOR

AT LEAST ONE YEAR.

HEDGES, ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS USING INTERNAL MODELS THAT USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, WHICH IS MITIGATED

BY MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERAL POSTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES.

LEVEL 3 RESIDUAL INTERESTS CONSIST OF OUR RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED VACATION OWNERSHIP MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES AND ARE VALUED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT CONSIDERS ESTIMATED INTEREST

RATES, DISCOUNT RATES, PREPAYMENT, AND DEFAULTS. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN FISCAL 2011.

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ON FILM PRODUCTIONS WHICH ARE REPORTED IN COSTS AND EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE FILM IMPAIRMENT CHARGES COMPARED OUR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS TO THE UNAMORTIZED

COST OF THE FILMS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS A LEVEL 3 VALUATION TECHNIQUE. THE AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUES OF THE FILMS WERE $132 MILLION AND $591 MILLION PRIOR TO THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS LISTED ABOVE, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ALSO INCLUDE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND BORROWINGS.

THE FAIR VALUES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS, DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUES. THE ESTIMATED YEAR END FAIR VALUES OF THE COMPANYS TOTAL BORROWINGS (CURRENT AND NONCURRENT) SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES, DETERMINED BASED ON BROKER QUOTES OR QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR INTEREST RATES FOR

THE SAME OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS ARE $14.2 BILLION AND $13.7 BILLION AT OCTOBER 1, 2011 AND OCTOBER 2, 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

THE COMPANY PREVIOUSLY SOLD MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE SALES OF ITS VACATION OWNERSHIP UNITS UNDER A FACILITY THAT EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 4, 2008 AND WAS NOT RENEWED. THE COMPANY SOLD

$17 MILLION OF MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES DURING THE YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 3, 2009, RESULTING IN GAIN ON SECURITIZED SALES OF VACATION OWNERSHIP INTERESTS OF $4 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2009.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SERVICE THE SOLD RECEIVABLES AND HAS A RESIDUAL INTEREST IN THOSE RECEIVABLES. AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011, THE

REMAINING OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT FOR SOLD MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES WAS $236 MILLION, AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS RESIDUAL INTEREST, WHICH IS RECORDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS, WAS $40 MILLION.

THE COMPANY REPURCHASES DEFAULTED MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES AT THEIR OUTSTANDING BALANCE. THE COMPANY DID NOT MAKE MATERIAL REPURCHASES IN THE

YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 1, 2011 OR OCTOBER 2, 2010. THE COMPANY GENERALLY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SELL THE REPURCHASED VACATION OWNERSHIP UNITS FOR AMOUNTS THAT EXCEED THE AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY WERE REPURCHASED.

THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES CREDIT SUPPORT FOR UP TO 70% OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE SOLD MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES WHICH THE MORTGAGE

RECEIVABLE ACQUIRER MAY DRAW ON IN THE EVENT OF LOSSES UNDER THE FACILITY. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A RESERVE FOR ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO THESE RECEIVABLES.

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS WITH,

AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE COUNTERPARTIES TO ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTIES.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT IT WOULD REALIZE A MATERIAL LOSS, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011, IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY SINGLE

DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS ONLY WITH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF A- OR BETTER. THE COMPANYS CURRENT POLICY REGARDING AGREEMENTS WITH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES IS GENERALLY TO

REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A- OR IN THE EVENT AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED LIMITS AS DEFINED BY CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE MATERIAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF LESS THAN

INVESTMENT GRADE. AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011, THE COMPANYS BALANCES THAT EXCEEDED 10% OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WERE 41% COMPARED TO 30% AS OF OCTOBER 2, 2010.

102

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES AND FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS DO NOT REPRESENT A

SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AT OCTOBER 1, 2011 DUE TO THE WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS INTO WHICH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD, THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE

COMPANYS PORTFOLIO AMONG ISSUERS.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS BORROWING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND

CASH FLOWS AND ON THE MARKET VALUE OF ITS BORROWINGS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS ITS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY USES PAY-FLOATING AND

PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO FACILITATE ITS INTEREST RATE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

103

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES PAY-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE

BORROWINGS EFFECTIVELY CONVERTING FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS TO VARIABLE RATE BORROWINGS INDEXED TO LIBOR. AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011 AND OCTOBER 2, 2010, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS PAY-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS $1.2

BILLION AND $1.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO FAIR VALUE HEDGES INCLUDED IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

THE COMPANY MAY DESIGNATE PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF INTEREST PAYMENTS ON

FLOATING-RATE BORROWINGS. PAY-FIXED SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FLOATING RATE BORROWINGS TO FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS. THE UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THESE CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE DEFERRED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) AND RECOGNIZED

IN INTEREST EXPENSE AS THE INTEREST PAYMENTS OCCUR. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF INTEREST PAYMENTS AT OCTOBER 1, 2011 NOR AT OCTOBER 2, 2010.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY TRANSACTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW FLUCTUATIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, ENABLING MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OPTION AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE

OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, FIRM COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY HEDGES ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS FOR PERIODS

GENERALLY NOT TO EXCEED FOUR YEARS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM RANGE OF ANNUAL EXPOSURE. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED FORECASTED TRANSACTION, ASSET, LIABILITY

OR FIRM COMMITMENT. THE PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, CANADIAN DOLLAR AND BRITISH POUND. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BORROWINGS INTO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS.

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FIRMLY COMMITTED AND FORECASTED

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011 AND OCTOBER 2, 2010, THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THE COMPANYS NET FOREIGN EXCHANGE CASH FLOW HEDGES WAS $3.6 BILLION AND $2.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. MARK TO MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON

THESE CONTRACTS ARE DEFERRED IN AOCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS OCCUR, OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED RELATED TO INEFFECTIVENESS FOR THE YEARS ENDED

OCTOBER 1, 2011 AND OCTOBER 2, 2010 WERE NOT MATERIAL. NET DEFERRED GAINS RECORDED IN AOCI FOR CONTRACTS THAT WILL MATURE IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS TOTALED $33 MILLION. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE PRE-TAX ADJUSTMENTS TO AOCI FOR

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AT OCTOBER 1, 2011 AND OCTOBER 2, 2010 WAS $2.6 BILLION AND $2.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. DURING THE YEARS ENDED

OCTOBER 1, 2011 AND OCTOBER 2, 2010, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A NET GAIN OF $24 MILLION AND $102 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN COSTS AND EXPENSES ON THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS WHICH OFFSET A NET LOSS OF $25 MILLION AND $173 MILLION ON THE

RELATED ECONOMIC EXPOSURES FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 1, 2011 AND OCTOBER 2, 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE VOLATILITY OF COMMODITIES PRICES AND DESIGNATES CERTAIN COMMODITY FORWARD

CONTRACTS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FORECASTED COMMODITY PURCHASES. MARK TO MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS ARE DEFERRED IN AOCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS OCCUR, OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF COMMODITY

PURCHASES. THE FAIR VALUE OF COMMODITY HEDGING CONTRACTS WAS NOT MATERIAL AT OCTOBER 1, 2011 NOR AT OCTOBER 2, 2010.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK MANAGEMENT  DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CERTAIN OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING.

THESE CONTRACTS, WHICH INCLUDE PAY FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND COMMODITY SWAP CONTRACTS, ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET ECONOMIC EXPOSURES OF THE COMPANY AND ARE CARRIED AT MARKET VALUE WITH ANY CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS.

THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THESE CONTRACTS AT OCTOBER 1, 2011 AND OCTOBER 2, 2010 WAS $184 MILLION AND $218 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE GAINS OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN INCOME FOR FISCAL 2011 AND FISCAL 2010 WERE NOT MATERIAL.

CONTINGENT FEATURES

THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO POST COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT THAT A NET LIABILITY POSITION

WITH A COUNTERPARTY EXCEEDS LIMITS DEFINED BY CONTRACT AND THAT VARY WITH DISNEYS CREDIT RATING. IF THE COMPANYS CREDIT RATINGS WERE TO FALL BELOW INVESTMENT GRADE, SUCH COUNTERPARTIES WOULD ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE OUR

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A NET PAYMENT TO OR FROM THE COMPANY FOR THE AGGREGATE NET VALUE BY COUNTERPARTY OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE AGGREGATE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WITH CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

IN A NET LIABILITY POSITION BY COUNTERPARTY WERE $114 MILLION AND $306 MILLION ON OCTOBER 1, 2011 AND OCTOBER 2, 2010, RESPECTIVELY.
