GENERALLY, THE COMPANYS CABLE NETWORKS OPERATE UNDER MULTI-YEAR CARRIAGE AGREEMENTS WITH MVSPS THAT INCLUDE CONTRACTUALLY DETERMINED FEES. THE AMOUNTS THAT WE CAN CHARGE TO MVSPS FOR OUR CABLE NETWORK SERVICES ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON

COMPETITION AND THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF PROGRAMMING THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. THE ABILITY TO SELL TIME FOR COMMERCIAL ANNOUNCEMENTS AND THE RATES RECEIVED ARE PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON THE SIZE AND NATURE OF THE AUDIENCE THAT THE NETWORK CAN DELIVER TO

OUR BROADCASTING AND CABLE NETWORKS. THE COMPANYS CABLE NETWORKS ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER CABLE NETWORKS FOR CARRIAGE BY MVSPS. THE COMPANYS CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH MVSPS ARE RENEWED OR RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE CABLE AND SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION

OF ITS VARIOUS CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE.

THE COMPANYS MEDIA

NETWORKS BUSINESSES ALSO COMPETE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING. THE MARKET FOR PROGRAMMING IS VERY COMPETITIVE, PARTICULARLY FOR SPORTS PROGRAMMING. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS SPORTS RIGHTS AGREEMENTS WITH THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL

LEAGUE (NFL), COLLEGE FOOTBALL (INCLUDING COLLEGE BOWL GAMES) AND BASKETBALL CONFERENCES, NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION (NBA), NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STOCK CAR AUTO RACING (NASCAR), MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL (MLB), WORLD CUP AND VARIOUS SOCCER

LEAGUES, AND GOLF AND TENNIS ASSOCIATIONS.

THE COMPANYS INTERNET WEB SITES AND DIGITAL PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH OTHER WEB

SITES AND ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CATEGORIES.

ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE MEDIA NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO

SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN

AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS ARE MET, AND THESE COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION

DURING THIS PERIOD.

FEDERAL REGULATION

TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) UNDER FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934, AS

AMENDED. VIOLATION OF FCC REGULATIONS CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY FORFEITURES, LIMITED RENEWALS OF LICENSES AND, IN EGREGIOUS CASES, DENIAL OF LICENSE RENEWAL OR REVOCATION OF A LICENSE. FCC REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT

INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



LICENSING OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS.

EACH OF THE TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE OWN MUST BE LICENSED BY THE FCC. THESE LICENSES ARE

GRANTED FOR PERIODS OF UP TO EIGHT YEARS, AND WE MUST OBTAIN RENEWAL OF LICENSES AS THEY EXPIRE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OPERATING THE STATIONS. WE (OR THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN THE CASE OF A DIVESTITURE) MUST ALSO OBTAIN FCC APPROVAL WHENEVER WE SEEK TO

HAVE A LICENSE TRANSFERRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OR DIVESTITURE OF A STATION. THE FCC MAY DECLINE TO RENEW OR APPROVE THE TRANSFER OF A LICENSE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE GENERALLY RECEIVED SUCH RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN

THE PAST, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ALWAYS OBTAIN NECESSARY RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE FUTURE.



TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP LIMITS.

THE FCC IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN

A SPECIFIC MARKET, ON THE COMBINED NUMBER OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SINGLE MARKET AND ON THE AGGREGATE PERCENTAGE OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE THAT CAN BE REACHED BY TELEVISION STATIONS WE OWN. CURRENTLY.



FCC REGULATIONS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN A MARKET, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND NATURE OF THE MARKET. WE DO NOT

OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN ANY OF THE TEN MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN A TELEVISION STATION.

7

TABLE OF CONTENTS



FEDERAL STATUTES PERMIT OUR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE AGGREGATE TO REACH A MAXIMUM OF 39% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE (FOR THIS PURPOSE, FCC REGULATIONS

ATTRIBUTE TO UHF TELEVISION STATIONS ONLY 50% OF THE TELEVISION HOUSEHOLDS IN THEIR MARKET). FOR PURPOSES OF THE FCCS RULES, OUR 10 STATIONS REACH APPROXIMATELY 23% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE.



FCC REGULATIONS IN SOME CASES IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL RADIO OR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN

RADIO STATIONS, BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS ARE MATERIAL TO OUR CURRENT OPERATING PLANS.



DUAL NETWORKS.

FCC RULES CURRENTLY PROHIBIT ANY OF THE FOUR MAJOR TELEVISION NETWORKS  ABC, CBS, FOX AND NBC  FROM BEING UNDER

COMMON OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.



REGULATION OF PROGRAMMING.

THE FCC REGULATES BROADCAST PROGRAMMING BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BANNING INDECENT PROGRAMMING, REGULATING

POLITICAL ADVERTISING AND IMPOSING COMMERCIAL TIME LIMITS DURING CHILDRENS PROGRAMMING. BROADCASTERS FACE A HEIGHTENED RISK OF BEING FOUND IN VIOLATION OF THE INDECENCY PROHIBITION BY THE FCC BECAUSE OF RECENT FCC DECISIONS, COUPLED WITH THE

SPONTANEITY OF LIVE PROGRAMMING. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE FCC INCREASED ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO INDECENCY, AND A NUMBER OF SIGNIFICANT INDECENCY CASES AGAINST VARIOUS BROADCASTERS REMAIN PENDING IN THE COURTS. MOREOVER, CONGRESS

RECENTLY INCREASED PENALTIES FOR BROADCASTING INDECENT PROGRAMMING TO A MAXIMUM OF $325,000 PER VIOLATION.

FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND FCC RULES ALSO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL MATTER THAT MAY BE SHOWN ON BROADCAST OR CABLE CHANNELS DURING PROGRAMMING DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN 12 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. IN ADDITION, BROADCAST CHANNELS ARE

GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF THREE HOURS PER WEEK OF PROGRAMMING THAT HAS AS A SIGNIFICANT PURPOSE MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN 16 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. FCC RULES ALSO GIVE TELEVISION

STATION OWNERS THE RIGHT TO REJECT OR REFUSE NETWORK PROGRAMMING IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO SUBSTITUTE PROGRAMMING THAT THE LICENSEE REASONABLY BELIEVES TO BE OF GREATER LOCAL OR NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.



CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS.

WITH RESPECT TO CABLE SYSTEMS OPERATING WITHIN A TELEVISION STATIONS

DESIGNATED MARKET AREA, FCC RULES REQUIRE THAT EVERY THREE YEARS EACH TELEVISION STATION ELECT EITHER MUST CARRY STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH CABLE OPERATORS GENERALLY MUST CARRY A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION IN THE STATIONS MARKET, OR

RETRANSMISSION CONSENT STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE CABLE OPERATOR MUST NEGOTIATE WITH THE TELEVISION STATION TO OBTAIN THE CONSENT OF THE TELEVISION STATION PRIOR TO CARRYING ITS SIGNAL. UNDER THE SATELLITE HOME VIEWER IMPROVEMENT ACT

AND ITS SUCCESSOR, THE SATELLITE HOME VIEWER EXTENSION AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT, SATELLITE CARRIERS ARE PERMITTED TO RETRANSMIT A LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS SIGNAL INTO ITS LOCAL MARKET WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LOCAL TELEVISION STATION. UNDER

MUST CARRY, IF A SATELLITE CARRIER ELECTS TO CARRY ONE LOCAL STATION IN A MARKET, THE SATELLITE CARRIER MUST CARRY THE SIGNALS OF ALL LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS THAT ALSO REQUEST CARRIAGE. CERTAIN OF THE SATELLITE CARRIAGE PROVISIONS ARE SET TO

EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 31, 2009, ALTHOUGH LEGISLATION IS PENDING THAT WOULD CONTINUE MANY OF THE RELEVANT PROVISIONS.



DIGITAL TELEVISION.

ALL OF THE COMPANYS STATIONS NOW OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY ON DIGITAL CHANNELS, AND WE ARE EVALUATING VARIOUS OPTIONS WITH

RESPECT TO USE OF DIGITAL CAPABILITIES.



CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF PROGRAMMING.

THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND FCC RULES REGULATE SOME ASPECTS OF NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING CABLE AND

SATELLITE RETRANSMISSION CONSENT, AND SOME CABLE AND SATELLITE COMPANIES HAVE SOUGHT REGULATION OF ADDITIONAL ASPECTS OF THE CARRIAGE OF PROGRAMMING ON CABLE AND SATELLITE SYSTEMS. LITIGATION HAS BEEN INSTITUTED AGAINST THE COMPANY, OTHER PROGRAM

PROVIDERS AND DISTRIBUTORS SEEKING AMONG OTHER THINGS TO ACHIEVE SIMILAR ENDS. NEW LEGISLATION, COURT ACTION OR REGULATION IN THIS AREA COULD, DEPENDING ON ITS SPECIFIC NATURE, HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS.

THE FOREGOING IS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND OTHER LEGISLATION AND

OF SPECIFIC FCC RULES AND POLICIES. REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE TO THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT, OTHER LEGISLATION, FCC RULES AND PUBLIC NOTICES AND RULINGS OF THE FCC FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FCCS REGULATORY

AUTHORITY.

FCC LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND THE COMPANY GENERALLY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER NEW LEGISLATION,

COURT ACTION OR REGULATIONS, OR A CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OF APPLICATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF CURRENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

FOR AN ENTERPRISE AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS THE COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE.

IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS AFFECTING SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPERATIONS IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THESE OPERATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING OUR

OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

RECENT CHANGES IN U.S., GLOBAL, OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A CONTINUING ADVERSE EFFECT

ON THE PROFITABILITY OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES.

THE RECENT DECLINE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND

OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS HAS AFFECTED DEMAND FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND CONTINUATION OF THIS CONDITION COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, THUS REDUCING OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS. THE

DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAS REDUCED AND COULD CONTINUE TO REDUCE SPENDING AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS, PURCHASE OF OR PRICES FOR ADVERTISING ON OUR BROADCAST OR CABLE NETWORKS OR OWNED STATIONS, PERFORMANCE OF OUR HOME ENTERTAINMENT RELEASES,

AND PURCHASES OF COMPANY-BRANDED CONSUMER PRODUCTS. A CONTINUING DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO REDUCE ATTENDANCE AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS OR PRICES THAT MVSPS PAY FOR OUR CABLE PROGRAMMING. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE ALSO AND COULD

CONTINUE TO IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THOSE WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS TO SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN PRICE LEVELS GENERALLY, OR IN PRICE LEVELS IN A PARTICULAR SECTOR SUCH AS THE ENERGY SECTOR, COULD RESULT IN A SHIFT IN

CONSUMER DEMAND AWAY FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS WE OFFER, WHICH COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASE OUR COSTS. CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY REDUCE INTERNATIONAL DEMAND

FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCREASE OUR LABOR OR SUPPLY COSTS IN NON-UNITED STATES MARKETS, OR REDUCE THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR VALUE OF REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER MARKETS.

CHANGES IN PUBLIC AND CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF

ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES CREATES ENTERTAINMENT OR CONSUMER PRODUCTS WHOSE SUCCESS DEPENDS

SUBSTANTIALLY ON CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES THAT CHANGE IN OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO CONSISTENTLY CREATE AND DISTRIBUTE FILMED ENTERTAINMENT, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ONLINE

MATERIAL, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, HOTELS AND OTHER RESORT FACILITIES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE CHANGING PREFERENCES OF THE BROAD CONSUMER MARKET. MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON WORLDWIDE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR

OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND THEIR SUCCESS THEREFORE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT AND ADAPT TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES OUTSIDE AS WELL AS INSIDE THE UNITED STATES. MOREOVER, WE MUST OFTEN

INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN FILM PRODUCTION, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, OR HOTELS AND OTHER RESORT FACILITIES BEFORE WE LEARN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PRODUCTS WILL EARN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. IF OUR

ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, OUR REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING SALES (WHICH ARE BASED IN PART ON RATINGS FOR THE PROGRAMS IN WHICH ADVERTISEMENTS AIR) OR SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR BROADCAST AND CABLE

PROGRAMMING AND ONLINE SERVICES, FROM THEATRICAL FILM RECEIPTS OR HOME VIDEO OR ELECTRONIC GAME SALES, FROM THEME PARK ADMISSIONS, HOTEL ROOM CHARGES AND MERCHANDISE, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES, FROM SALES OF LICENSED CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR FROM SALES OF

OUR OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY DECLINE AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES.

CHANGES IN

TECHNOLOGY AND IN CONSUMER CONSUMPTION PATTERNS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS OR THE COST OF PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTS.

THE MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT AND INTERNET BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE, DEVELOP, ADOPT AND EXPLOIT NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO DISTINGUISH OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGIES AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THE TIME AND MANNER IN WHICH CONSUMERS ACQUIRE AND VIEW SOME OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO ADVERTISERS FOR REACHING THEIR

DESIRED MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE.



THE SUCCESS OF OUR OFFERINGS IN THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET DEPENDS IN PART ON CONSUMER PREFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO HOME ENTERTAINMENT FORMATS,

INCLUDING DVD PLAYERS AND PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDERS, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE HOME ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING WEB-BASED DELIVERY OF ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS;

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS



TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OFFER CONSUMERS AN EXPANDING ARRAY OF ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS AND IF CONSUMERS FAVOR OPTIONS WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED

RATHER THAN THE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS WE OFFER, OUR SALES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES IS

HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE EXISTENCE AND MAINTENANCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE CREATE.

THE VALUE TO US OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF OUR RIGHTS AS DEFINED BY APPLICABLE LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THOSE LAWS

ARE CONSTRUED. IF THOSE LAWS ARE DRAFTED OR INTERPRETED IN WAYS THAT LIMIT THE EXTENT OR DURATION OF OUR RIGHTS, OR IF EXISTING LAWS ARE CHANGED, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY DECREASE, OR THE COST OF OBTAINING

AND MAINTAINING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE.

THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF

PROTECTING THESE RIGHTS OR REDUCE OUR REVENUES. NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION, AND ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES, THE FALLING PRICES OF DEVICES INCORPORATING SUCH TECHNOLOGIES, AND INCREASED BROADBAND INTERNET SPEED

AND PENETRATION HAVE MADE THE UNAUTHORIZED DIGITAL COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR FILMS, TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND OTHER CREATIVE WORKS EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MORE CHALLENGING. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT

UNAUTHORIZED USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY GENERALLY IS A SIGNIFICANT AND RAPIDLY GROWING PHENOMENON. INADEQUATE LAWS OR WEAK ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN ONE COUNTRY CAN ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE, DESPITE THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THESE DEVELOPMENTS REQUIRE US TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

AGAINST UNLICENSED USE AND PRESENT THE RISK OF INCREASED LOSSES OF REVENUE AS A RESULT OF UNLICENSED DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION OF OUR CONTENT AND SALES OF UNAUTHORIZED DVDS, BLU-RAY DISCS AND OTHER PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE COMPANY AND RIGHTS ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY FROM OTHERS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE

RISK OF CHALLENGES TO OUR RIGHTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BY THIRD PARTIES. SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGES TO OUR RIGHTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS FOR OBTAINING RIGHTS OR THE LOSS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN REVENUE FROM THE

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF CHALLENGED RIGHTS. THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF ANY CHALLENGES TO ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT IT CURRENTLY FORESEES HAVING A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS.

A VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR INCREASE

THE COST OF PROVIDING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PARTICULARLY OUR THEME PARKS AND

RESORTS, IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM. THE ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM, AS WELL AS DEMAND FOR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE UNITED STATES, GLOBALLY OR IN

SPECIFIC REGIONS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING: ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR NATURAL DISASTERS (SUCH AS EXCESSIVE HEAT OR RAIN, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES); HEALTH CONCERNS; INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL OR MILITARY

DEVELOPMENTS; AND TERRORIST ATTACKS. THESE EVENTS AND OTHERS, SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN TRAVEL AND ENERGY COSTS AND COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACKS OR OTHER WIDESPREAD COMPUTING OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, MAY ALSO DAMAGE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THESE EVENTS. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE ROYALTIES FROM THE SALES OF OUR LICENSED GOODS AND SERVICES BY THIRD PARTIES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESSES OPERATED UNDER BRANDS LICENSED

FROM THE COMPANY, AND WE ARE THEREFORE DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESSES OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES FOR THAT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE. A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS COULD INFLUENCE THE SUCCESS OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES AND IF NEGATIVE FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED A

SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF OUR LICENSEES THEY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE OBTAIN INSURANCE AGAINST THE RISK OF LOSSES RELATING TO SOME BUT NOT ALL OF THESE EVENTS, AND WHEN INSURANCE IS OBTAINED IT IS

SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES, EXCLUSIONS AND CAPS. THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF COVERAGE WE OBTAIN VARY FROM TIME TO TIME DEPENDING ON OUR VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SPECIFIC TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS IN RELATION TO THE COST OF OBTAINING COVERAGE FOR SUCH TYPES

AND LEVELS OF LOSS.

CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS OR OTHERWISE AFFECT THE

PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OCCUR WE MAY NEED TO ADJUST OUR BUSINESS

STRATEGIES TO MEET THESE CHANGES OR WE MAY OTHERWISE FIND IT NECESSARY TO RESTRUCTURE OUR OPERATIONS OR PARTICULAR BUSINESSES OR ASSETS. IN

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADDITION, EXTERNAL EVENTS INCLUDING ACCEPTANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL OFFERINGS AND CHANGES IN MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS. WHEN THESE CHANGES OR EVENTS OCCUR, WE MAY

INCUR COSTS TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND MAY NEED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF ASSETS. WE MAY ALSO NEED TO INVEST IN NEW BUSINESSES THAT HAVE SHORT-TERM RETURNS THAT ARE NEGATIVE OR LOW AND WHOSE ULTIMATE BUSINESS PROSPECTS ARE UNCERTAIN. IN

ANY OF THESE EVENTS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE, WE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS OR RETURNS ON NEW INVESTMENTS MAY BE LOWER THAN PRIOR TO THE CHANGE IN STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING.

TURMOIL IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND IMPEDE ACCESS TO OR INCREASE THE COST OF FINANCING OUR OPERATIONS AND

INVESTMENTS.

U.S. AND GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION BEGINNING IN LATE 2008, MAKING

IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY BUSINESSES TO OBTAIN FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. IN ADDITION, EQUITY MARKETS EXPERIENCED RAPID AND WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN VALUE. THESE CONDITIONS TENDED TO INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING AND IF THEY RECUR, OUR COST OF

BORROWING COULD INCREASE AND IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES WHICH ARE

BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. A DECREASE IN THESE RATINGS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US

TO OBTAIN FINANCING. THE DISRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS ALSO IMPACTED SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. A SIMILAR DECLINE IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SECURE

CREDIT-WORTHY COUNTERPARTIES FOR OUR INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING PROGRAMS AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SETTLE EXISTING CONTRACTS.

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL

COMPETITION IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES FROM ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER AND FROM OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO MUST COMPETE TO OBTAIN HUMAN RESOURCES, PROGRAMMING

AND OTHER RESOURCES WE REQUIRE IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE.

HOME VIDEO PRODUCTS AND INTERNET USAGE.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND STATIONS COMPETE FOR THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES, AND THE

INTERNET, AS WELL AS WITH NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES AND BILLBOARDS.



PUBLISHERS AND RETAILERS OF CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES.



OUR INTERACTIVE MEDIA VIDEO GAME OPERATIONS COMPETE PRIMARILY WITH OTHER PUBLISHERS OF VIDEO GAME SOFTWARE AND OTHER TYPES OF HOME ENTERTAINMENT.

COMPETITION IN EACH OF THESE AREAS MAY DIVERT CONSUMERS FROM OUR CREATIVE OR OTHER PRODUCTS, OR TO OTHER

PRODUCTS OR OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR MARKETING COSTS. COMPETITION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF RESOURCES CAN INCREASE THE COST OF PRODUCING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUSTAINED INCREASES IN COSTS OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND OTHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELFARE

BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

WITH APPROXIMATELY 144,000 EMPLOYEES, OUR PROFITABILITY IS SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED

BY COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS AND CURRENT AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. WE MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THESE COSTS AS A RESULT OF MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING INCREASES IN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE.

IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN INVESTMENT RETURNS AND DISCOUNT RATES USED TO CALCULATE PENSION EXPENSE AND RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE VOLATILE AND MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS IN SOME YEARS. THESE MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS AS WELL AS

THE DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF PENSION PLAN ASSETS MAY PUT UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING PENSION AND MEDICAL BENEFITS AND MAY INCREASE FUTURE FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS,

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE COULD REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF LONG-TERM PROGRAMMING OR CARRIAGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT RENEWED ON SUFFICIENTLY FAVORABLE TERMS.

WE ENTER INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR BOTH THE ACQUISITION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTS FOR

THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS FOR SPORTING EVENTS AND OTHER PROGRAMS, AND CONTRACTS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PROGRAMMING TO MVSPS. AS THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRE, WE MUST RENEW OR RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RENEW THEM

ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY LOSE PROGRAMMING RIGHTS OR DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS. EVEN IF THESE CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED, THE COST OF OBTAINING PROGRAMMING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE (OR INCREASE AT FASTER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE) OR THE REVENUE FROM

DISTRIBUTION OF PROGRAMS MAY BE REDUCED (OR INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE). WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, THE IMPACT OF THESE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS ON OUR

RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT REVENUES FROM PROGRAMMING BASED

ON THESE RIGHTS WILL EXCEED THE COST OF THE RIGHTS PLUS THE OTHER COSTS OF PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAMMING.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROVISIONS IN OUR CORPORATE DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE STATE LAW COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL,

EVEN IF THAT CHANGE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO SHAREHOLDERS.

OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION CONTAINS A PROVISION

REGULATING THE ABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BRING MATTERS FOR ACTION BEFORE ANNUAL AND SPECIAL MEETINGS AND AUTHORIZES OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE AND SET THE TERMS OF PREFERRED STOCK. THE REGULATIONS ON SHAREHOLDER ACTION COULD MAKE IT MORE

DIFFICULT FOR ANY PERSON SEEKING TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF ACTIONS THAT WOULD SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD EFFECTIVELY DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF ANY PERSON SEEKING CONTROL OR

OTHERWISE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN CONTROL. IN ADDITION, PROVISIONS IN OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION REQUIRE SUPERMAJORITY SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF SOME ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS

OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, EITHER OF WHICH COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE OF CONTROL IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE SEASONALITY OF CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES COULD EXACERBATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS.

EACH OF OUR

BUSINESSES IS NORMALLY SUBJECT TO SEASONAL VARIATIONS, AS FOLLOWS.



REVENUES IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. IN GENERAL, ADVERTISING REVENUES

ARE SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS ARE MET,

AND THESE COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION DURING THIS PERIOD.



REVENUES IN OUR PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY RESULTING FROM THE SEASONAL NATURE OF

VACATION TRAVEL AND LOCAL ENTERTAINMENT EXCURSIONS. PEAK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY GENERALLY OCCUR DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN SCHOOL VACATIONS OCCUR AND DURING EARLY-WINTER AND SPRING-HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT, AND

TELEVISION MARKETS. RELEASE DATES ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF THEATRICAL

RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS.



REVENUES IN OUR INTERACTIVE MEDIA SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF VIDEO GAME RELEASES WHICH ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING THEATRICAL RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS, COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF HOLIDAY PERIODS. REVENUES FROM CERTAIN OF OUR INTERNET AND MOBILE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR SEASONAL TRENDS.

ACCORDINGLY, IF A SHORT TERM NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OCCURS DURING A TIME OF HIGH SEASONAL DEMAND (SUCH AS HURRICANE DAMAGE TO OUR

PARKS DURING THE SUMMER TRAVEL SEASON), THE EFFECT COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF THAT BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR.

THE

COMPANYS ACQUISITION OF MARVEL IS EXPECTED TO CAUSE SHORT TERM DILUTION IN EARNINGS PER SHARE AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANTICIPATED IMPROVEMENTS IN EARNINGS PER SHARE WILL BE REALIZED.

ON AUGUST 31, 2009, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT, INC. IN A MERGER TRANSACTION. BASED ON THE

NUMBER OF FULLY DILUTED SHARES OF MARVEL COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING AS OF SEPTEMBER 18, 2009, THE COMPANY EXPECTS (ASSUMING THERE IS NO ADJUSTMENT TO THE EXCHANGE RATIO) THAT THE NUMBER OF ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES WILL INCREASE BY

APPROXIMATELY 58.5 MILLION SHARES AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER. WE EXPECT THAT THE MERGER WILL INITIALLY RESULT IN LOWER EARNINGS PER SHARE THAN WE WOULD HAVE EARNED IN THE ABSENCE OF THE MERGER. WE EXPECT THAT OVER TIME THE MERGER WILL YIELD

BENEFITS TO THE COMBINED COMPANY SUCH THAT THE MERGER WILL ULTIMATELY BE ACCRETIVE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS PER SHARE EXPECTED IN THE LONG TERM WILL BE ACHIEVED. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE

INCREASES IN EARNINGS PER SHARE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL, AMONG OTHER THINGS, NEED TO EFFECTIVELY CONTINUE THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS OF MARVEL AFTER THE

22

MERGER, DEVELOP SUCCESSFUL NEW CONTENT (INCLUDING FUTURE FEATURE FILMS AND TELEVISION SERIES OR SEQUELS TO MARVEL PRODUCTIONS) BASED ON MARVEL CHARACTERS AND SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE MARVEL

ITEM 3.   LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

MILNE AND DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. V. STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC.

ON NOVEMBER 5, 2002, CLARE MILNE, THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A. A.

MILNE, AUTHOR OF THE WINNIE THE POOH BOOKS, AND THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. (DEI) FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. (SSI) IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. ON

NOVEMBER 4, 2002, MS. MILNE SERVED NOTICES TO SSI AND DEI TERMINATING A. A. MILNES PRIOR GRANT OF RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004, AND GRANTED ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS TO DEI. IN THEIR LAWSUIT, MS. MILNE

AND DEI SOUGHT A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, UNDER UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT LAW, THAT MS. MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE VALID; THAT SSIS RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH IN THE UNITED STATES TERMINATED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004; THAT UPON

TERMINATION OF SSIS RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

LAWSUIT (THE STATE COURT ACTION) TERMINATED BY OPERATION OF LAW; AND

THAT, AS OF NOVEMBER 5, 2004, SSI WAS ENTITLED TO NO FURTHER ROYALTIES FOR USES OF WINNIE THE POOH. SSI FILED (A) AN ANSWER DENYING THE MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT AND (B) COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT

(I) MS. MILNES GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI IS VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE AND (II) DEI REMAINS OBLIGATED TO PAY SSI ROYALTIES UNDER THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT. THE DISTRICT COURT RULED THAT MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE INVALID.

THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED, AND ON JUNE 26, 2006, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DENIED MILNES PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI. ON AUGUST 1, 2003, SSI FILED AN AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS AND A

THIRD-PARTY COMPLAINT AGAINST HARRIET HUNT (HEIR TO E. H. SHEPARD, ILLUSTRATOR OF THE ORIGINAL WINNIE THE POOH STORIES), WHO HAD SERVED A NOTICE OF TERMINATION AND A GRANT OF RIGHTS SIMILAR TO MS. MILNES, AND ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS

AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE MILNE AND HUNT TERMINATIONS AND THE GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI FOR (A) UNLAWFUL AND UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES; AND (B) BREACH OF THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT.

ON OCTOBER 19, 2006, THE PARTIES STIPULATED TO SSIS FILING ITS FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS (FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER)

SEEKING (A) TO INVALIDATE THE HUNT TERMINATION NOTICE, (B) TO TERMINATE THE COMPANYS RIGHTS VIS-À-VIS SSI, AND (C) DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS, AMONG OTHER RELIEF. THAT STIPULATION ALSO PROVIDED THAT HUNT AND

THE COMPANY NEED NOT RESPOND TO THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF TWO EVENTS: THE STATE COURT APPEAL IN

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

, AND THE TRIAL IN THE DISTRICT COURT ON THE VALIDITY OF THE HUNT

TERMINATION NOTICE. SSI THEN SOUGHT TO WITHDRAW BOTH THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND ITS STIPULATION, BUT ON NOVEMBER 3, 2006, THE DISTRICT COURT DENIED THAT REQUEST. SSIS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE VALIDITY OF HUNTS 2002

ATTEMPT TO RECAPTURE E. H. SHEPARDS RIGHTS WAS GRANTED ON FEBRUARY 15, 2007, AND THEREAFTER, ON MARCH 27, 2007, THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED AS MOOT ALL CLAIMS AGAINST HUNT AND THREE OF SSIS COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY

RELATED TO THE COMPANYS AGREEMENTS WITH MILNE AND HUNT CONCERNING THE TERMINATION AND DISPOSITION OF THEIR RIGHTS. ON JANUARY 3, 2008, THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DENIED SSIS PETITION FOR REVIEW IN THE STATE COURT ACTION, WHEREUPON

ON APRIL 21, 2008, THE COMPANY MOVED FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON ALL OF SSIS CLAIMS IN THE DISTRICT COURT ACTION. ON JUNE 3, 2008, THE DISTRICT COURT ORDERED FURTHER BRIEFING ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER SSIS MISCONDUCT IN THE STATE

COURT ACTION WARRANTS DISMISSAL OF ALL OF ITS CLAIMS IN THE DISTRICT COURT, AND THEN ON JULY 29, 2008, THE DISTRICT COURT REFERRED THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION TO A SPECIAL MASTER, WHO RENDERED A SEALED RECOMMENDATION ON MARCH 26, 2009. ON

MAY 19, 2009, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE SSIS FOUR CONTRACT AND FRAUD COUNTERCLAIMS AND INVITED THE PARTIES TO FILE SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTIONS ON THE REMAINING

INFRINGEMENT AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLAIMS. ON SEPTEMBER 25, 2009, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON SSIS REMAINING CLAIMS AND ON OCTOBER 21, 2009, SSI AND THE COMPANY FILED APPLICATIONS FOR

ATTORNEYS FEES. ON NOVEMBER 5, 2009, SSI APPEALED FROM THE DISTRICT COURTS JUDGMENT TO THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

RELATEDLY, ON DECEMBER 4, 2006, AUGUST 22, 2007, FEBRUARY 8, APRIL 18, AUGUST 27 AND OCTOBER 31, 2008, AND FEBRUARY 17, JULY 27, AND

NOVEMBER 17, 2009, SSI INITIATED PROCEEDINGS IN THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (PTO) SEEKING CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH TRADEMARK REGISTRATIONS AND OPPOSING APPLICATIONS FOR OTHER WINNIE THE POOH TRADEMARKS. PRIOR TO

JULY 27, THE PTO HAD ALREADY SUSPENDED THE THEN-PENDING PROCEEDINGS ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE RELIEF SOUGHT IS EFFECTIVELY DUPLICATIVE OF THAT SOUGHT IN THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER. ON OCTOBER 8, 2009, THE COMPANY ADVISED THE PTO OF THE

DISTRICT COURTS GRANT OF SUMMARY JUDGMENT AGAINST SSI, AND REQUESTED DISMISSAL OF ALL OF SSIS PENDING PROCEEDINGS. ALSO, ON APRIL 18, OCTOBER 16 AND OCTOBER 27, 2008 AND JULY 28, 2009, SSI INITIATED ACTIONS

BEFORE THE CANADIAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OFFICE (CIPO) OPPOSING APPLICATIONS FOR CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH TRADEMARKS. ON AUGUST 4, 2009, SSI REQUESTED AN EXTENSION OF TIME TO OPPOSE ANOTHER APPLICATION BY THE COMPANY FOR A WINNIE

THE POOH TRADEMARK. ON SEPTEMBER 4, 2008, AND FEBRUARY 12 AND MARCH 10, 2009, THE COMPANY FILED ANSWERS TO THE ACTIONS BEFORE THE CIPO, DENYING SSIS CLAIMS.

2009 VS. 2008

REVENUES FOR THE YEAR DECREASED 4%, OR $1.7 BILLION, TO $36.1 BILLION; NET INCOME DECREASED 25%, OR $1.1 BILLION, TO $3.3 BILLION; AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE DECREASED 23% TO $1.76.

NET INCOME FOR THE CURRENT YEAR INCLUDED CERTAIN ITEMS THAT AFFECTED COMPARABILITY, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ($0.17

PER DILUTED SHARE), A NON-CASH GAIN IN CONNECTION WITH THE MERGER OF LIFETIME AND AETN ($0.08 PER DILUTED SHARE) AND A GAIN ON THE SALE OF OUR INVESTMENT IN TWO PAY TELEVISION SERVICES IN LATIN AMERICA ($0.04 PER DILUTED SHARE). INCLUDING THE IMPACT

OF ROUNDING, THESE ITEMS COLLECTIVELY RESULTED IN A NET ADVERSE IMPACT OF $0.06 PER DILUTED SHARE. FISCAL 2008 INCLUDED AN ACCOUNTING GAIN RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE DISNEY STORES NORTH AMERICA AND A GAIN ON THE SALE OF MOVIES.COM (TOGETHER

$0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE), THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN INCOME TAX MATTERS ($0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE), A BAD DEBT CHARGE FOR A RECEIVABLE FROM LEHMAN BROTHERS ($0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE) AND AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ($0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE). THESE

ITEMS COLLECTIVELY HAD NO NET IMPACT ON EARNINGS PER SHARE. THE CURRENT YEAR RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE THE BENEFIT FROM ONE ADDITIONAL WEEK OF OPERATIONS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2008 AND FISCAL 2007 DUE TO THE TIMING OF OUR FISCAL PERIOD END. FISCAL 2010 WILL

NOT INCLUDE AN ADDITIONAL WEEK AND WILL BE A FIFTY-TWO WEEK FISCAL YEAR.

THE DECREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE REFLECTED

LOWER OPERATING RESULTS AND THE ITEMS DISCUSSED ABOVE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING RESULTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER BROADCAST AND CABLE ADVERTISING REVENUES, A DECLINE IN

WORLDWIDE SALES OF DVD UNITS, DECREASED GUEST SPENDING AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS AND DISNEYLAND PARIS, HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS AND PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION AT OUR CABLE AND BROADCAST BUSINESSES, LOWER PERFORMANCE OF OUR MOVIES IN

WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL AND TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION AND LOWER EARNED REVENUE AT OUR LICENSING BUSINESS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES ON REVENUES FROM MVSPS (AFFILIATE FEES), PRINCIPALLY AT ESPN, COST MITIGATION

ACTIVITIES AT WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT AND DISNEYLAND PARIS AND HIGHER INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS.

2008

VS. 2007

REVENUES FOR THE YEAR INCREASED 7%, OR $2.3 BILLION, TO $37.8 BILLION; NET INCOME DECREASED 6%, OR $260 MILLION,

TO $4.4 BILLION; AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED 1% TO $2.28.

INCLUDED CERTAIN ITEMS WHICH AFFECTED COMPARABILITY. FISCAL 2007 INCLUDED GAINS FROM THE SALES OF E! ENTERTAINMENT AND US WEEKLY (TOGETHER $0.31 PER DILUTED SHARE), THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN INCOME TAX MATTERS ($0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE),

INCOME FROM THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF THE ABC RADIO BUSINESS ($0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE), AN EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN MODIFICATION CHARGE ($0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE) AND AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ($0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE). THESE ITEMS COLLECTIVELY

RESULTED IN A NET BENEFIT OF $0.33 PER DILUTED SHARE.

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE INCREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR FISCAL 2008 WAS THE RESULT OF AN INCREASE IN

SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS AND A DECREASE IN WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF THE GAINS IN FISCAL 2007 DISCUSSED ABOVE. HIGHER SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS REFLECTED INCREASES IN AFFILIATE FEES AND ADVERTISING

REVENUES AT OUR CABLE BUSINESSES, HIGHER GUEST SPENDING AND ATTENDANCE AT WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT AND DISNEYLAND PARIS, AND STRONG SALES OF LICENSED PRODUCTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN WORLDWIDE DVD SALES.

RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

THE COMPANY RECORDED CHARGES TOTALING $492 MILLION FOR THE CURRENT YEAR WHICH INCLUDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $279 MILLION AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS OF $213 MILLION. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THE IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES WERE $142 MILLION RELATED TO FCC RADIO LICENSES AND $65 MILLION RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN UTV SOFTWARE COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED (UTV). THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES INCLUDED SEVERANCE AND OTHER RELATED COSTS AS A RESULT OF VARIOUS ONGOING

ORGANIZATIONAL AND COST STRUCTURE INITIATIVES ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES. RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR THE PRIOR YEAR CONSISTED OF AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $39 MILLION RELATED TO FCC RADIO LICENSES.

INCREASED CABLE NETWORKS REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH OF $614 MILLION FROM AFFILIATE FEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

DECREASE OF $149 MILLION FROM ADVERTISING REVENUES. AFFILIATE FEES ARE GENERALLY DERIVED FROM FEES CHARGED ON A PER-SUBSCRIBER BASIS, AND THE INCREASE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES AT ESPN AND, TO A LESSER

EXTENT, AT THE DOMESTIC DISNEY CHANNEL AND ABC FAMILY, THE IMPACT OF THE ADDITIONAL WEEK OF

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OPERATIONS AND SUBSCRIBER GROWTH AT ESPN. LOWER ADVERTISING REVENUE REFLECTED A DECREASE AT ESPN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE AT ABC FAMILY. THE DECREASE AT ESPN REFLECTED FEWER UNITS SOLD,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RATES. THE INCREASE AT ABC FAMILY REFLECTED INCREASED UNITS SOLD AND HIGHER RATES. HIGHER AFFILIATE FEES AT THE DOMESTIC DISNEY CHANNEL WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY LOWER DVD SALES.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CONTRACTS WITH CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS INCLUDE ANNUAL LIVE PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS. IN THESE CASES,

RECOGNITION OF REVENUES SUBJECT TO THE COMMITMENTS IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE ANNUAL COMMITMENTS ARE SATISFIED, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

DECREASED BROADCASTING REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER ADVERTISING SALES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND AT THE OWNED TELEVISION

STATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS DRIVEN BY

GREYS ANATOMY, PRIVATE PRACTICE,

AND

CRIMINAL MINDS

. LOWER ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK REFLECTED

LOWER PRIMETIME RATINGS.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS COSTS, PRODUCTION COSTS, PARTICIPATION COSTS, DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING EXPENSES AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, INCREASED 5%, OR

$539 MILLION, TO $12.0 BILLION, CONSISTING OF A 6% INCREASE, OR $367 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND A 3% INCREASE, OR $172 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER RIGHTS COSTS AT ESPN DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE

INCREASES FOR KEY CONTRACTS AND COSTS OF NEW AND RENEWED CONTRACTS FOR COLLEGE AND INTERNATIONAL SPORTS PROGRAMMING AND INCREASED PROGRAMMING COSTS AT ABC FAMILY DUE TO MORE ORIGINAL SERIES. THE INCREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER

PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS AND A BAD DEBT CHARGE IN CONNECTION WITH A BANKRUPTCY OF A SYNDICATION CUSTOMER. HIGHER PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS REFLECTED MORE HOURS OF ORIGINAL SCRIPTED PRIMETIME PROGRAMMING AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK

AND HIGHER PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION RELATED TO SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS.

SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF RIGHTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING PACKAGES, INCLUDING THE NATIONAL

FOOTBALL LEAGUE, COLLEGE FOOTBALL (INCLUDING COLLEGE BOWL GAMES) AND BASKETBALL CONFERENCES, NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION, NASCAR, MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL, WORLD CUP AND VARIOUS SOCCER LEAGUES, AND GOLF AND TENNIS ASSOCIATIONS. THE COSTS OF THESE

CONTRACTS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. WE ENTER INTO THESE CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT, OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACTS, REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING DURING THE PROGRAMMING AND AFFILIATE FEES WILL EXCEED THE COSTS

OF THE PROGRAMMING. WHILE CONTRACT COSTS MAY INITIALLY EXCEED INCREMENTAL REVENUES AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OPERATING INCOME, IT IS OUR EXPECTATION THAT THE COMBINED VALUE TO OUR NETWORKS FROM ALL OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL RESULT IN LONG-TERM BENEFITS.

THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THESE CONTRACTS ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS IS DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER

AUDIENCES.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 4%, OR $216 MILLION, TO $4.8 BILLION FOR THE YEAR DUE TO A DECREASE OF $337 MILLION AT BROADCASTING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $121 MILLION AT THE CABLE

NETWORKS. THE DECREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER ADVERTISING SALES, HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS AND THE SYNDICATION CUSTOMER BAD DEBT CHARGE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS. THE INCREASE AT THE CABLE

NETWORKS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH AT ESPN AND ABC FAMILY.

PARKS AND RESORTS

REVENUES

REVENUES DECREASED 7%, OR $837 MILLION, TO $10.7 BILLION DUE TO DECREASES OF $531 MILLION AT OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND $306 MILLION AT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

AT OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS, DECREASED REVENUE

REFLECTED A DECREASE IN GUEST SPENDING, PRINCIPALLY AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS, AND LOWER GAINS ON SECURITIZED SALES OF OWNERSHIP INTERESTS AT DISNEY VACATION CLUB. DECREASED GUEST SPENDING AT THE DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS REFLECTED LOWER AVERAGE

TICKET PRICES, LOWER AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATES AND DECREASED MERCHANDISE SPENDING. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN REVENUE RECOGNITION AT DISNEY VACATION CLUB IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPLETION OF A VACATION CLUB

PROPERTY.

AT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, LOWER REVENUES RESULTED FROM A DECREASE AT DISNEYLAND PARIS DUE TO THE UNFAVORABLE

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO AND DECREASED GUEST SPENDING. DECREASED GUEST SPENDING WAS DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE TICKET PRICES, DECREASED MERCHANDISE SPENDING AND LOWER

AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATES.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF LABOR, DEPRECIATION, COSTS OF MERCHANDISE, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SOLD, MARKETING AND SALES EXPENSE, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE AND ENTERTAINMENT, DECREASED 4%, OR

$358 MILLION. THE DECREASE IN COSTS AND EXPENSES WAS DRIVEN BY DECREASES AT DISNEYLAND PARIS AND THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE AT DISNEY VACATION CLUB. THE DECREASE AT DISNEYLAND PARIS WAS DUE TO THE FAVORABLE IMPACT

OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO AND SAVINGS FROM COST MITIGATION ACTIVITIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LABOR AND OTHER COST INFLATION. THE DECREASE AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT WAS

DRIVEN BY SAVINGS FROM COST MITIGATION ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LABOR AND OTHER COST INFLATION. THE INCREASE AT DISNEY VACATION CLUB WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER PER UNIT COST OF SALES AND EXPENSE RECOGNITION IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPLETION OF A

VACATION CLUB PROPERTY.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

ENTERTAINMENT, $129 MILLION IN MUSIC DISTRIBUTION AND $106 MILLION IN WORLDWIDE TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION.

THE DECREASE IN

WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER UNIT SALES AND NET EFFECTIVE PRICING, REFLECTING THE OVERALL DECLINE IN THE DVD MARKET AND THE STRENGTH OF

DISTRIBUTION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION.

THE DECREASE IN COSTS AT WORLDWIDE HOME

ENTERTAINMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION RESULTING FROM A DECLINE IN DVD UNIT SALES. THE DECREASE IN MUSIC DISTRIBUTION REFLECTED THE ABSENCE OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

HANNAH MONTANA

CONCERT TOUR IN THE PRIOR YEAR. INCREASED COSTS AND EXPENSES IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION REFLECTED HIGHER MARKETING COSTS FOR CURRENT YEAR RELEASES AND HIGHER FILM COST WRITE-DOWNS.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

CONSUMER PRODUCTS

REVENUES

REVENUES WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT AT $2.4 BILLION AS AN INCREASE OF $131 MILLION AT OUR RETAIL BUSINESS WAS OFFSET BY

DECREASES OF $86 MILLION AT MERCHANDISE LICENSING AND $44 MILLION AT PUBLISHING. THE INCREASE AT OUR RETAIL BUSINESS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE DISNEY STORES NORTH AMERICA DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008 (SEE DISCUSSION OF

THE DISNEY STORES ACQUISITION BELOW), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AT THE DISNEY STORES EUROPE AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE BRITISH POUND AND EURO. THE DECREASE AT

MERCHANDISE LICENSING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER EARNED ROYALTY REVENUE ACROSS MULTIPLE PRODUCT CATEGORIES DUE TO THE DIFFICULT RETAIL ENVIRONMENT AS WELL AS THE STRENGTH OF

HANNAH MONTANA

HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL

PROPERTIES IN THE

PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE AT PUBLISHING REFLECTED LOWER MAGAZINE SALES DRIVEN BY THE CLOSURE OF

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AT THE DISNEY STORES EUROPE AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE BRITISH POUND AND EURO. THE DECREASE AT PUBLISHING REFLECTED

LOWER COST OF SALES AND OTHER OPERATING COSTS.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 22%, OR $169 MILLION, TO $609 MILLION DUE TO LOWER RESULTS AT MERCHANDISE LICENSING AND AT OUR RETAIL

BUSINESS, WHICH REFLECTED THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF A FULL YEAR OF COMPANY-OWNED OPERATIONS AT THE DISNEY STORES NORTH AMERICA IN FISCAL 2009 WHEREAS THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED FIVE MONTHS OF COMPANY-OWNED OPERATIONS AND SEVEN MONTHS OF LICENSED

INTERACTIVE MEDIA

REVENUES

INTERACTIVE MEDIA REVENUES DECREASED 1%, OR $7 MILLION, TO $712

MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF $58 MILLION AT DISNEY INTERACTIVE STUDIOS, DRIVEN BY LOWER SALES OF SELF-PUBLISHED VIDEO GAMES AND DECREASED LICENSING REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES OF $39 MILLION AT OUR MOBILE PHONE SERVICE BUSINESS

IN JAPAN, WHICH WAS LAUNCHED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008, AND $11 MILLION AT DISNEY ONLINE DRIVEN BY INCREASED SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES AT CLUB PENGUIN.

AT DISNEY INTERACTIVE STUDIOS, LOWER SELF-PUBLISHED VIDEO GAMES SALES REFLECTED DECREASED NET EFFECTIVE PRICING AND UNIT SALES. SIGNIFICANT CURRENT YEAR TITLES INCLUDED

HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL 3, SING IT

AND

BOLT

AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH INCLUDED

HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL, TUROK

,

HANNAH MONTANA 2

AND

PURE.

THE DECREASE IN LICENSING REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF

WALL-E, CARS

AND

RATATOUILLE

IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF VIDEO GAME AND INTERNET PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS, COST OF SALES, DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING EXPENSES, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, AND TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS, INCREASED 4%, OR $35 MILLION, TO $1.0 BILLION.

THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER UNIT COST OF

SALES AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS, WHICH INCLUDED THE COSTS FOR BUNDLED ACCESSORIES AND MUSIC ROYALTIES FOR CERTAIN CURRENT-YEAR TITLES AT DISNEY INTERACTIVE STUDIOS, HIGHER EXPENSES AT OUR MOBILE PHONE SERVICE BUSINESS IN JAPAN DRIVEN BY A FULL YEAR OF

OPERATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE AT DISNEY ONLINE DRIVEN BY LOWER MARKETING COSTS.

MINORITY INTEREST EXPENSE WAS FLAT AT $302 MILLION FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AS THE IMPACT OF LOWER FINANCING COSTS AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND AND

IMPROVED OPERATING RESULTS AT ESPN WERE OFFSET BY LOWER PERFORMANCE AT DISNEYLAND PARIS. THE MINORITY INTEREST IS DETERMINED ON INCOME AFTER ROYALTIES, FINANCING COSTS AND INCOME TAXES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN COSTS AFFECT RESULTS IN ALL FIVE SEGMENTS, WITH APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THESE COSTS BEING

BORNE BY THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSES OF $214 MILLION, $255 MILLION AND $278 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN FISCAL 2009

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS

DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED FROM A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

WE EXPECT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $268 MILLION TO $482 MILLION IN FISCAL 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO

A DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS AND ASSET RETURNS THAT WERE BELOW THE ASSUMED RETURN. THE DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE ASSET RETURN SHORTFALL VERSUS OUR EXPECTED RETURN IN FISCAL 2009

ALSO RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF OUR PLANS AND AN INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE WHICH TOTALS $2.8 BILLION ($1.8 BILLION AFTER-TAX) AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009. IF OUR INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE

DOES NOT IMPROVE RELATIVE TO OUR LONG-TERM ASSUMPTION AND/OR DISCOUNT RATES DO NOT INCREASE, WE EXPECT THAT PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE CONSIDERABLY HIGHER THAN FISCAL 2009 FOR THE NEXT FEW YEARS AS A RESULT OF

AMORTIZING THESE UNRECOGNIZED EXPENSES. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF THE IMPACTS OF OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. DURING FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY MADE

CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS TOTALING $473 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN

CONTRIBUTIONS IN FISCAL 2010 TO RANGE FROM $350 MILLION TO $450 MILLION, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO INCLUDE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. FINAL MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR FISCAL 2010 WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON OUR

JANUARY 1, 2010 FUNDING ACTUARIAL VALUATION WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE LATE FISCAL 2010. SEE ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS FOR THE IMPACT OF FACTORS AFFECTING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS.

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS  2008 VS. 2007

MEDIA NETWORKS

REVENUES

MEDIA NETWORKS REVENUES INCREASED 6%, OR $944 MILLION, TO $15.9 BILLION, CONSISTING OF A 10% INCREASE, OR $874 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND A 1% INCREASE, OR $70 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING.

INCREASED CABLE NETWORKS REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH OF $654 MILLION FROM AFFILIATE FEES AND $206 MILLION FROM

ADVERTISING REVENUES. INCREASED AFFILITATE FEES IN FISCAL 2008 WERE DRIVEN BY INCREASES AT ESPN AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE WORLDWIDE DISNEY CHANNELS AND ABC FAMILY. THE INCREASE AT ESPN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES AND

SUBSCRIBER GROWTH, THE INCREASE AT THE WORLDWIDE DISNEY CHANNELS WAS DRIVEN BY SUBSCRIBER GROWTH AND THE INCREASE AT ABC FAMILY WAS DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES. HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUES AT ESPN AND ABC FAMILY REFLECTED IMPROVED RATES AND

RATINGS. HIGHER DVD SALES, PRIMARILY

HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL

, WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM WITH AN INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR IN FISCAL 2007.

INCREASED BROADCASTING REVENUES REFLECTED HIGHER INTERNATIONAL SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED ADVERTISING

REVENUES, LARGELY AT THE OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS. INCREASED INTERNATIONAL SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS WERE DRIVEN BY

GREYS ANATOMY, PRIVATE PRACTICE

AND

REAPER

. FISCAL 2008 REVENUES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK WERE

COMPARABLE TO FISCAL 2007 AS THE IMPACT OF LOWER RATINGS WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER ADVERTISING RATES AND DIGITAL MEDIA REVENUES.

COSTS AND

EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES INCREASED 6%, OR $609 MILLION, TO $11.5 BILLION, CONSISTING OF AN 7% INCREASE, OR $448

MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND A 3% INCREASE, OR $161 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COSTS AT ESPN AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE WORLDWIDE DISNEY CHANNELS, DRIVEN BY HIGHER PROGRAMMING,

ADMINISTRATIVE AND MARKETING COSTS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PROGRAMMING COSTS AT ABC FAMILY. THE INCREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION RELATED TO

INTERNATIONAL SALES OF OUR PROGRAMS.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 10%, OR $447 MILLION, TO $5.0 BILLION DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $536 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $89 MILLION AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT THE CABLE NETWORKS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH AT ESPN, HIGHER INCOME AT OUR CABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, AND INCREASES AT ABC FAMILY AND THE DOMESTIC DISNEY CHANNELS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM WITH AN INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR IN FISCAL 2007. THE DECREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DUE TO LOWER ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS. THE INCREASE IN INCOME AT OUR CABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AFFILIATE AND ADVERTISING REVENUE AT LIFETIME AND A GAIN ON THE SALE OF A EUROPEAN CABLE CHANNEL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AT OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS, GROWTH IN REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES AT THE WALT

DISNEY WORLD RESORT AND DISNEY VACATION CLUB. REVENUE GROWTH AT WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED GUEST SPENDING AND THEME PARK ATTENDANCE. INCREASED GUEST SPENDING WAS DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE TICKET PRICES, INCREASED FOOD AND

BEVERAGE SALES AND HIGHER AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATES. AT DISNEY VACATION CLUB, REVENUE GROWTH REFLECTED HIGHER VACATION CLUB OWNERSHIP SALES, INCLUDING EXTENSIONS OF THE TERM OF OWNERSHIP ON EXISTING VACATION CLUB PROPERTIES.

AT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS, REVENUE GROWTH RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE AT DISNEYLAND PARIS DUE TO THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO AND INCREASED GUEST SPENDING AND THEME PARK ATTENDANCE. INCREASED GUEST SPENDING WAS DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATES AND AVERAGE TICKET PRICES.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES INCREASED 8%, OR $691 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES AT DISNEYLAND PARIS, WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT AND DISNEY VACATION CLUB. THE INCREASE AT DISNEYLAND PARIS WAS DUE TO THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO, LABOR COST INFLATION AND HIGHER VOLUME-RELATED COSTS. THE INCREASE AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT WAS DUE TO LABOR AND OTHER COST INFLATION, NEW GUEST OFFERINGS AND

VOLUME-RELATED COSTS. THE INCREASE AT DISNEY VACATION CLUB WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER PER UNIT COST OF SALES.

DUE TO DECREASES OF $117 MILLION IN WORLDWIDE TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION, $112 MILLION IN DOMESTIC THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION, AND $66 MILLION IN DOMESTIC HOME ENTERTAINMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $147 MILLION IN INTERNATIONAL HOME

ENTERTAINMENT.

THE DECREASE IN WORLDWIDE TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION REVENUES WAS DRIVEN BY THE ABSENCE OF THE MULTI-SEASON SALE

OF

HOME IMPROVEMENT

WHICH OCCURRED IN FISCAL 2007. LOWER REVENUES IN DOMESTIC THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION REFLECTED THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF FISCAL 2007 TITLES, INCLUDING

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLDS END, RATATOUILLE,

AND

WILD HOGS,

COMPARED TO THE TITLES IN FISCAL 2008, WHICH INCLUDED

NATIONAL TREASURE 2: BOOK OF SECRETS

AND

WALL-E

. LOWER REVENUES IN DOMESTIC HOME ENTERTAINMENT WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN UNIT SALES REFLECTING THE

PERFORMANCE OF

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLDS END

AND

RATATOUILLE

IN FISCAL 2008 COMPARED TO

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MANS CHEST

AND

CARS

IN FISCAL 2007.

REVENUE GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL HOME ENTERTAINMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER UNIT SALES MIX OF TELEVISION SERIES DVD SETS, WHICH HAVE

HIGHER AVERAGE UNIT SALES PRICES.

COST AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR FISCAL 2008 WERE COMPARABLE TO FISCAL 2007 AS DECREASES IN WORLDWIDE TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION AND DOMESTIC THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL

HOME ENTERTAINMENT.

LOWER COSTS AND EXPENSES IN WORLDWIDE TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN

AMORTIZATION AND PARTICIPATION COSTS DRIVEN BY THE ABSENCE OF THE

HOME IMPROVEMENT

SALE. THE DECREASE IN DOMESTIC THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AMORTIZATION EXPENSE REFLECTING DECREASED REVENUES FOR FISCAL 2008 RELEASES

AND LOWER FILM COST WRITE-DOWNS. THE INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL HOME ENTERTAINMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER DISTRIBUTION COSTS DRIVEN BY EXTENSIVE MARKETING CAMPAIGNS IN FISCAL 2008.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

THE INCREASE AT OUR RETAIL

BUSINESS WAS DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE DISNEY STORES NORTH AMERICA DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008. THE REVENUE GROWTH AT MERCHANDISE LICENSING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EARNED ROYALTIES ACROSS MULTIPLE PRODUCT CATEGORIES, LED BY

AND RESORT EXPANSION, NEW RIDES AND ATTRACTIONS, CRUISE SHIPS, RECURRING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. THE INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS IN FISCAL 2009 REFLECTED SPENDING ON DISNEYS CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE

EXPANSION AND CONSTRUCTION PROGRESS PAYMENTS ON TWO NEW CRUISE SHIPS. THE DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS IN FISCAL 2008 REFLECTED LOWER EXPENDITURES AT DISNEYLAND PARIS AS A RESULT OF COMPLETION OF PROJECTS

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT MEDIA NETWORKS PRIMARILY REFLECT INVESTMENTS IN FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT FOR EXPANDING AND UPGRADING BROADCAST CENTERS, PRODUCTION FACILITIES, AND TELEVISION STATION FACILITIES.

DECREASED BY $1.4 BILLION TO $2.6 BILLION IN FISCAL 2009 AND CONSISTED OF REPAYMENTS OF BORROWINGS, THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS AND REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK. THE DECREASE FROM FISCAL 2008 WAS DUE TO LOWER SHARE REPURCHASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER REPAYMENTS OF BORROWINGS AND DECREASED PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES. CASH USED IN CONTINUING FINANCING ACTIVITIES DURING FISCAL 2008 AND 2007 OF $4.0 BILLION AND $3.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, CONSISTED OF SHARE REPURCHASES AND

DIVIDENDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BORROWINGS AND THE PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTION EXERCISES. BORROWINGS DURING FISCAL 2007 INCLUDED $1.35 BILLION OF PRE-SPIN-OFF BORROWINGS OF ABC RADIO HOLDINGS, INC. THAT WERE REMOVED FROM THE COMPANYS BALANCE

SHEET IN CONNECTION WITH THE SPIN-OFF.

THESE BANK FACILITIES ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS AT LIBOR-BASED RATES PLUS A SPREAD, WHICH

DEPENDS ON THE COMPANYS PUBLIC DEBT RATING AND CAN RANGE FROM 0.175% TO 0.75%. AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD NOT BORROWED UNDER THESE BANK FACILITIES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO ISSUE UP TO $800 MILLION OF LETTERS OF

CREDIT UNDER THE FACILITY EXPIRING IN 2011, WHICH IF UTILIZED, REDUCES AVAILABLE BORROWING UNDER THIS FACILITY. AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009, $326 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT HAD BEEN ISSUED OF WHICH $237 MILLION WAS ISSUED UNDER THIS FACILITY.

THE COMPANY MAY USE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS UP TO THE AMOUNT OF ITS UNUSED BANK FACILITIES (SEE ABOVE), IN CONJUNCTION

WITH TERM DEBT ISSUANCE AND OPERATING CASH FLOW, TO RETIRE OR REFINANCE OTHER BORROWINGS BEFORE OR AS THEY COME DUE.

AS OF

THE FILING DATE OF THIS REPORT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD NOT YET DECLARED A DIVIDEND RELATED TO FISCAL 2009. THE COMPANY PAID A $648 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.35 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2009 RELATED TO FISCAL 2008. THE COMPANY

PAID A $664 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.35 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008 RELATED TO FISCAL 2007; AND PAID A $637 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.31 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007 RELATED TO FISCAL 2006.

DURING FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 5 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $138 MILLION. DURING FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY

REPURCHASED 139 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $4.5 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2007, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 202 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $6.9 BILLION. AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD REMAINING

AUTHORIZATION IN PLACE TO REPURCHASE 179 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH BALANCES,

OTHER LIQUID ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION

OF EXISTING BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAN BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL. SEE ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS.

IN ADDITION TO MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE COMPANYS BORROWING COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED

BY CERTAIN CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. AS OF DECEMBER 2, 2009, MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A2 AND P-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK;

STANDARD & POORS LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A AND A-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH CREDITWATCH NEGATIVE; AND FITCHS LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A AND F-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE

OUTLOOK. THE COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT, RELATING TO INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE COMPANY MET ON OCTOBER 3, 2009, BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. THE COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES ALSO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE

CERTAIN ENTITIES, SUCH AS EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND, FROM ANY REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

EURO DISNEY HAS COVENANTS UNDER ITS DEBT AGREEMENTS THAT LIMIT ITS INVESTMENT AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND REQUIRE IT TO MEET CERTAIN ANNUAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COVENANTS. SUBJECT TO FINAL THIRD-PARTY REVIEW AS PROVIDED IN ITS DEBT

AGREEMENTS, EURO DISNEY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS COMPLIED WITH ITS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COVENANTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009.

CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS WHICH ARE

RECORDED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OTHER ITEMS, SUCH AS CERTAIN PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND OTHER EXECUTORY CONTRACTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT ARE REQUIRED TO BE

DISCLOSED IN THE FOOTNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO ACQUIRE BROADCAST PROGRAMMING AND MAKE CERTAIN MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS FOR THE USE OF PROPERTY UNDER OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS AT

OCTOBER 3, 2009 AND THE FUTURE PERIODS IN WHICH SUCH OBLIGATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SETTLED IN CASH. IN ADDITION, THE TABLE REFLECTS THE TIMING OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST PAYMENTS ON OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS. ADDITIONAL DETAILS REGARDING THESE

COMPANYS CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL GUARANTEES.

LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS

AS DISCLOSED IN NOTES 10 AND 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR CERTAIN LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF

MANAGEMENT. FOR A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND COSTS

WE EXPENSE FILM AND TELEVISION

PRODUCTION, PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS REVENUES TO THE ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FOR EACH PRODUCTION. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF

ULTIMATE REVENUES DECREASES, AMORTIZATION OF FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED. CONVERSELY, IF ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES INCREASE, FILM AND TELEVISION COST AMORTIZATION MAY BE SLOWED. FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE

REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION SERIES, WE INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN

PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER.

WITH RESPECT TO FILMS INTENDED FOR THEATRICAL

RELEASE, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES (AND THEREFORE AFFECTING FUTURE FILM COST AMORTIZATION AND/OR IMPAIRMENT) IS DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. REVENUES DERIVED FROM OTHER MARKETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE

DOMESTIC THEATRICAL RELEASE (E.G. THE HOME VIDEO OR INTERNATIONAL THEATRICAL MARKETS) HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE VARIES PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND

DEMAND FOR A PARTICULAR FILM, THE POPULARITY OF COMPETING FILMS AT THE TIME OF RELEASE AND THE LEVEL OF MARKETING EFFORT. UPON A FILMS RELEASE AND DETERMINATION OF DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF REVENUES FROM

SUCCEEDING WINDOWS AND MARKETS ARE REVISED BASED ON HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND AN ANALYSIS OF CURRENT MARKET TRENDS. THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR RELEASED FILMS IS THE EXTENT OF HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES

ACHIEVED. HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES VARY BASED ON THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF COMPETING HOME VIDEO PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE MANNER IN WHICH RETAILERS MARKET AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO TELEVISION SERIES OR OTHER TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS INTENDED FOR BROADCAST, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTORS AFFECTING ESTIMATES OF

ULTIMATE REVENUES IS THE PROGRAMS RATING AND THE STRENGTH OF THE ADVERTISING MARKET. PROGRAM RATINGS, WHICH ARE AN INDICATION OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, DIRECTLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE ADVERTISING

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REVENUES DURING THE AIRING OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, TELEVISION SERIES WITH GREATER MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUES THROUGH THE EVENTUAL SALE OF THE PROGRAM

RIGHTS IN THE SYNDICATION, INTERNATIONAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKETS. ALTERNATIVELY, POOR RATINGS MAY RESULT IN A TELEVISION SERIES CANCELLATION, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE IMMEDIATE WRITE-OFF OF ANY UNAMORTIZED PRODUCTION COSTS. A SIGNIFICANT

DECLINE IN THE ADVERTISING MARKET WOULD ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ESTIMATES.

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF TELEVISION BROADCAST

RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. AMORTIZATION OF THOSE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ASSETS BEING

AMORTIZED ON A NUMBER OF AIRINGS BASIS MAY BE ACCELERATED IF WE REDUCE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS AND SLOWED IF WE INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS. THE NUMBER OF FUTURE AIRINGS OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY THE

PROGRAMS RATINGS IN PREVIOUS AIRINGS, EXPECTED ADVERTISING RATES AND AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMMING. ACCORDINGLY, PLANNED USAGE IS REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND REVISED IF NECESSARY. RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS

PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS REVENUES TO ULTIMATE REVENUES (THE PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD) OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD, AS APPROPRIATE. REVENUES INCLUDE BOTH

ADVERTISING REVENUES AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE FEES. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON OVER THE TERM OF A MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENT APPROXIMATE EACH SEASONS RIGHTS COST BASED ON THE PROJECTED

REVENUE METHOD, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED ANNUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. IF ULTIMATE REVENUES CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PROJECTIONS, AMORTIZATION OF THE RIGHTS COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED OR SLOWED.

COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS WHICH COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WITH THE

UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF

A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE EARLY MORNING, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN, AND SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS

FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN-OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM. ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS ARE

LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR PROJECTIONS, FILM, TELEVISION AND PROGRAMMING COST WRITE-DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ITS VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THE CIRCUMSTANCES

OF EACH BUSINESS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THESE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES.

WE

REDUCE HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND SOFTWARE PRODUCT REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED FUTURE RETURNS OF MERCHANDISE AND FOR CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND SALES INCENTIVES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL RETURN EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS

OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD, WE MAY RECORD LESS REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS EXCEED THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT. CONVERSELY, IF WE

OVERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS FOR A PERIOD, WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS ARE LESS THAN ESTIMATED.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. FOR NON-EXPIRING, MULTI-DAY TICKETS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER A THREE-YEAR TIME PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE,

WHICH IS DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS. IF ACTUAL USAGE IS DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATED USAGE, REVENUES MAY NOT BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIODS THE RELATED SERVICES ARE RENDERED. IN ADDITION, A CHANGE IN USAGE PATTERNS WOULD IMPACT THE TIMING

OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

THE COMPANYS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE CALCULATED USING A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY MEASUREMENT WHICH WE EVALUATE ANNUALLY. OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE AND

EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS RETIREMENT PATTERNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER AND RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE.

THE DISCOUNT

RATE ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS FOR BENEFITS AS A PRESENT VALUE ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE INCREASES THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES PENSION

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXPENSE. THE GUIDELINE FOR SETTING THIS RATE IS A HIGH-QUALITY LONG-TERM CORPORATE BOND RATE. WE DECREASED OUR DISCOUNT RATE TO 5.75% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2009 FROM 7.80% AT THE BEGINNING OF

FISCAL 2009 TO REFLECT MARKET INTEREST RATE CONDITIONS AT OUR OCTOBER 3, 2009 MEASUREMENT DATE. THIS DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WILL AFFECT NET PERIODIC PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE IN FISCAL 2010. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE

REFLECTS MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE

RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD HAVE INCREASED TOTAL NET PERIODIC PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE FOR

FISCAL 2010 BY $169 MILLION AND WOULD INCREASE THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT OCTOBER 3, 2009 BY $1.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD HAVE DECREASED THESE AMOUNTS BY $149 MILLION

AND $1.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE

CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATION, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON EACH PLAN ASSET CLASS. A LOWER EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE. OUR LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.75%

AND 7.50% FOR THE 2009 AND 2008 ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN THE RATE USED FOR THE YEAR END 2009 ACTUARIAL VALUATION WAS DUE TO CHANGES IN THE RANGES OF EXPECTED RETURNS ON CERTAIN PLAN ASSET CLASSES. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT

CHANGE IN THE LONG-TERM RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSET ASSUMPTION WOULD IMPACT FISCAL 2010 ANNUAL PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $57 MILLION.

SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO

TEST GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF CURRENT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE AN INTERIM IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS,

WHICH ARE GENERALLY AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE REPORTING LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE

OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET

MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. WE APPLY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES ARE SENSITIVE TO OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH

AND MARGINS FOR THESE BUSINESSES. WE INCLUDE IN THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUE WE BELIEVE THE REPORTING UNIT WOULD RECEIVE IF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE REPORTING UNIT THAT IS BEING USED BY OTHER REPORTING UNITS

WAS LICENSED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AT ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS THOSE INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS. WE BELIEVE OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE CONSISTENT WITH HOW A MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANT

WOULD VALUE OUR REPORTING UNITS.

IN LIGHT OF RECENT ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANYS

LONG-TERM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A GREATER DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE

COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE ACCOUNTING RULES WORK, A RELATIVELY MODEST REDUCTION IN OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR BROADCASTING REPORTING UNIT COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE.

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING

AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED

VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY HAS COST AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE

PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT FOR THESE INVESTMENTS, WE CONSIDER THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS THE FORECASTED FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTEES AND MARKET VALUES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF THESE FORECASTS ARE NOT MET OR MARKET VALUES INDICATE AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING THE CURRENT YEAR, THE COMPANY TESTED ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT AND RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $279 MILLION. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES INCLUDE $142 MILLION FOR FCC RADIO LICENSES AND $65 MILLION FOR OUR INVESTMENT IN UTV. DURING FISCAL YEARS 2008 AND

2007, THE COMPANY RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $39 MILLION AND $26 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO FCC RADIO LICENSES. THE FCC RADIO LICENSE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REFLECTED OVERALL MARKET DECLINES IN CERTAIN RADIO MARKETS IN WHICH WE

OPERATE. THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, WHICH WERE ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WERE RECORDED IN RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

WE EVALUATE OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND ESTIMATE COLLECTIBILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL BAD DEBT EXPERIENCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES

WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. IN LIGHT OF THE RECENT TURMOIL IN THE DOMESTIC AND GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT HAS AFFECTED MANY COMPANIES, OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTIBILITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES FROM THESE COMPANIES HAVE BECOME SUBJECT

TO GREATER UNCERTAINTY THAN IN MORE STABLE PERIODS. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS IS TOO LOW, COSTS AND EXPENSES MAY INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND IF IT IS TOO HIGH, COST AND EXPENSES MAY DECREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LOSSES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS. THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE

COUNSEL AND ARE BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY

AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE PROCEEDINGS. SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.

INCOME TAX AUDITS

AS A

MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. OUR DETERMINATIONS REGARDING THE RECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX BENEFITS ARE MADE

IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE TAX AND LEGAL COUNSEL WHERE APPROPRIATE AND ARE BASED UPON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF OUR TAX POSITIONS IN CONSIDERATION OF APPLICABLE TAX STATUTES AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND PRECEDENTS AND UPON THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF

PROCEEDINGS (OR NEGOTIATIONS) WITH TAXING AND LEGAL AUTHORITIES. THE TAX BENEFITS ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY THE COMPANY MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS DECISION TO

SETTLE RATHER THAN LITIGATE A MATTER, RELEVANT LEGAL PRECEDENT RELATED TO SIMILAR MATTERS AND THE COMPANYS SUCCESS IN SUPPORTING ITS FILING POSITIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES.

STOCK OPTION COMPENSATION EXPENSE

EACH YEAR DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, THE

COMPANY AWARDS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO A BROAD-BASED GROUP OF MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL (THE ANNUAL GRANT). THE COMPANY USES A BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS VOLATILITY, DIVIDEND

YIELD, AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE (THE MULTIPLE OF EXERCISE PRICE TO GRANT PRICE AT WHICH EXERCISES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON AVERAGE) AND THE TERMINATION RATE (THE

PROBABILITY OF A VESTED OPTION BEING CANCELLED DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE OPTION HOLDER) IN COMPUTING THE VALUE OF THE OPTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL SHOULD PRODUCE A FAIR VALUE THAT IS REPRESENTATIVE

OF THE VALUE OF AN EMPLOYEE OPTION.

IN FISCAL YEARS 2009, 2008, AND 2007, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE

OPTIONS-PRICING MODELS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS NOT ADJUSTED AFTER THE GRANT DATE,

CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE THE VALUE OF, AND THEREFORE THE EXPENSE RELATED TO, FUTURE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE GREATEST VARIATION IN FAIR VALUE IN THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ARE THE EXPECTED

VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN EITHER THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE WILL CAUSE THE BINOMIAL OPTION VALUE TO INCREASE OR DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION CONSIDERS BOTH HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS

CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION. IF THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF 47% USED BY THE COMPANY DURING 2009 WAS INCREASED OR DECREASED BY FIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS

(I.E. TO 52% OR TO 42%), THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR 2009 STOCK OPTION GRANTS WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY 9% OR DECREASED BY 7%, RESPECTIVELY.

THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE MAY BE INFLUENCED BY THE COMPANYS FUTURE STOCK PERFORMANCE, STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY, AND EMPLOYEE TURNOVER RATES. IF THE EXERCISE MULTIPLE ASSUMPTION OF 1.39 USED BY

THE COMPANY DURING 2009 WERE INCREASED TO 1.6 OR DECREASED TO 1.2, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE BINOMIAL VALUE OF OUR 2009 STOCK OPTION GRANTS WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY 7% OR DECREASED BY 8%, RESPECTIVELY.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

REVENUE

ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE

ON REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL YEAR, ALTHOUGH EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE GUIDANCE REVISES THE CRITERIA FOR SEPARATING, MEASURING, AND ALLOCATING ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION TO EACH

DELIVERABLE IN A MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES COMPANIES TO ALLOCATE REVENUE USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE OF EACH DELIVERABLE, WHICH MUST BE ESTIMATED IF THERE IS NO HISTORY OF SELLING THE DELIVERABLE ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS

NOR THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE. THE COMPANY IS ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF THIS GUIDANCE ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON TRANSFERS AND

SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS TO ELIMINATE THE CONCEPT OF A QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY, CHANGE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR OFF BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTING FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS INCLUDING LIMITING THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE OFF BALANCE SHEET TREATMENT FOR A

PORTION OF A FINANCIAL ASSET IS ALLOWABLE, AND REQUIRE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO REVISE THE APPROACH TO DETERMINE WHEN A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED. THE NEW CONSOLIDATION MODEL FOR VIES CONSIDERS WHETHER THE COMPANY

HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND SHARES IN THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND REWARDS OF THE ENTITY. THE GUIDANCE ON VIES REQUIRES COMPANIES TO CONTINUALLY REASSESS VIES TO

DETERMINE IF CONSOLIDATION IS APPROPRIATE AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY IS ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF THIS GUIDANCE ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT DEFINES COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS. A COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT IS A CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT THAT INVOLVES A JOINT

OPERATING ACTIVITY, FOR EXAMPLE AN AGREEMENT TO CO-PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE A MOTION PICTURE WITH ANOTHER STUDIO. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2010 FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE ON

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT ESTABLISHES PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR DETERMINING HOW A COMPANY RECOGNIZES AND MEASURES

THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION, INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, AND CERTAIN ACQUIRED CONTINGENCIES. THE GUIDANCE ON BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ALSO REQUIRES

ACQUISITION-RELATED TRANSACTION EXPENSES AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS BE EXPENSED AS INCURRED RATHER THAN CAPITALIZED. THIS GUIDANCE WILL BE APPLICABLE PROSPECTIVELY TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS BEGINNING IN THE COMPANYS 2010 FISCAL YEAR.

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST (MINORITY INTERESTS)

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR A NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN A SUBSIDIARY.

UPON ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPORT ITS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO PRESENT NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY SEPARATELY IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. CURRENTLY, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS ARE REPORTED BETWEEN LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE COMPANYS

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND THE RELATED INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IS REFLECTED AS AN EXPENSE IN ARRIVING AT NET INCOME. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2010 FISCAL YEAR AND REQUIRES RETROACTIVE

ADOPTION OF THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR EXISTING NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS. ALL OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY.

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE

FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CHANGES IN THAT FUNDED STATUS TO BE

RECOGNIZED IN COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR. THE GUIDANCE ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS ALSO REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF THE FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE RECOGNITION PROVISION

IN FISCAL YEAR 2007 WHICH RESULTED IN A $261 MILLION CHARGE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISION BY REMEASURING PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2009. ADOPTION OF

THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF $35 MILLION TO RETAINED EARNINGS AND A $100 MILLION BENEFIT TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2009 WERE 7.80% FOR THE DISCOUNT RATE, 7.50% FOR THE RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, AND

5.00% FOR SALARY INCREASES. BASED ON THIS MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS DECREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $214 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO $255 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. THE DECREASE IN

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY REMEASURED PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT OCTOBER 3, 2009 IN ACCORDANCE WITH NEW GUIDANCE ON ACCOUNTING FOR RETIREMENT PLANS. KEY ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE MEASUREMENT AT

OCTOBER 3, 2009 WERE 5.75% FOR THE DISCOUNT RATE, 7.75% FOR THE RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, AND 4.50% FOR SALARY INCREASES. BASED ON THE MEASUREMENT AT OCTOBER 3, 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE, WHICH TOTALS $2.8 BILLION ($1.8 BILLION AFTER-TAX) AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009.

INCOME TAX

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING A MINIMUM PROBABILITY THRESHOLD THAT A

TAX POSITION MUST MEET BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF

ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE

SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE GUIDANCE ON INCOME TAXES AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. APPLYING THE GUIDANCE ON INCOME TAXES TO ALL TAX POSITIONS UPON ADOPTION RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS OF $148 MILLION AND $15 MILLION TO OPENING RETAINED

EARNINGS AND MINORITY INTERESTS, RESPECTIVELY.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE

COMPANY. WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE WRITTEN OR ORAL STATEMENTS THAT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING, INCLUDING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND IN REPORTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS.

SUCH STATEMENTS MAY, FOR EXAMPLE, EXPRESS EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE ACTIONS THAT WE MAY TAKE, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING OR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, OR ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL INCLUDING CHANGES IN DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE MADE ON THE BASIS OF MANAGEMENTS VIEWS AND ASSUMPTIONS AS OF THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE THESE STATEMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS

WILL NECESSARILY COME TO PASS. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING THESE EXPECTATIONS ARE SET FORTH UNDER ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET

RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS

AND CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST

RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, AND THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE

OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN MINIMUM

AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF

EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW IN ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT

VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS, AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES

TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED, TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE PRINCIPAL FOREIGN CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN, AND

CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES OF ITS

FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES GENERALLY FOR PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED FOUR YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS ARE TO USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH

FLOWS ARISING FROM COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES. THE AMOUNTS HEDGED USING COMMODITY SWAP CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON FORECASTED LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES, SUCH AS FUEL OIL AND GASOLINE.

IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY OTHER HEDGING TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

VALUE AT RISK (VAR)

THE

COMPANY UTILIZES A VAR MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES WERE MADE ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET

CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED IN A VAR COMPUTATION. THE COMPANYS COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES, AND EQUITY PRICES (A

VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS WERE DETERMINED BY OBSERVING INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY, AND EQUITY MARKET CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING QUARTER FOR THE CALCULATION OF VAR AMOUNTS AT FISCAL YEAR END. THE MODEL INCLUDES

ALL OF THE COMPANYS DEBT AS WELL AS ALL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES, WHICH CERTAIN OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK

ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WILL BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS.

VAR ON A COMBINED BASIS DECREASED TO $34 MILLION AT OCTOBER 3, 2009 FROM $68 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2008. THE DECREASE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED DIVERSIFICATION BENEFITS ACROSS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND LOWER VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY

AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO

FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER,

WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION. BASED ON OUR EVALUATION UNDER THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK,

MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT OCTOBER 3, 2009 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED

OCTOBER 3, 2009 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

OCTOBER 3, 2009, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO

INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTES 2 AND 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES IN 2008 AND ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR PENSION AND

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS IN 2007 AND 2009.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;

(II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING

MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS

ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS MAJORITY-OWNED AND CONTROLLED

SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. IN DECEMBER 1999, DVD FINANCING, INC. (DFI), A SUBSIDIARY OF DISNEY VACATION DEVELOPMENT, INC. AND AN INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, COMPLETED A

RECEIVABLE SALE TRANSACTION THAT ESTABLISHED A FACILITY THAT PERMITS DFI TO SELL RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE SALE OF VACATION CLUB MEMBERSHIPS ON A PERIODIC BASIS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS FACILITY, DFI PREPARES SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

ALTHOUGH ITS SEPARATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE ALSO CONSOLIDATED IN THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. DFIS ABILITY TO SELL NEW RECEIVABLES UNDER THIS FACILITY ENDED ON DECEMBER 4, 2008. (SEE NOTE 16 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THIS FACILITY)

REPORTING PERIOD

THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE SATURDAY CLOSEST TO SEPTEMBER 30 AND CONSISTS OF FIFTY-TWO WEEKS WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS, WE HAVE A FIFTY-THREE WEEK YEAR. WHEN A FIFTY-THREE WEEK YEAR OCCURS, THE

COMPANY REPORTS THE ADDITIONAL WEEK IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. FISCAL 2009 IS A FIFTY-THREE WEEK YEAR BEGINNING ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2008 AND ENDING ON OCTOBER 3, 2009.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE FISCAL

2008 AND FISCAL 2007 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO CONFORM TO THE FISCAL 2009 PRESENTATION.

71

TABLE OF CONTENTS

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND FOOTNOTES THERETO. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

BROADCAST ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN COMMERCIALS ARE AIRED. REVENUES FROM TELEVISION SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS PRIMARY CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS INCLUDE ANNUAL LIVE PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS. IN THESE CASES, RECOGNITION

OF REVENUES SUBJECT TO THE COMMITMENTS IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE ANNUAL COMMITMENTS ARE SATISFIED, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. FOR NON-EXPIRING, MULTI-DAY TICKETS, WE RECOGNIZE

REVENUE OVER A THREE-YEAR TIME PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS.

REVENUES

FROM THE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION OF MOTION PICTURES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN MOTION PICTURES ARE EXHIBITED. REVENUES FROM VIDEO AND VIDEO GAME SALES, NET OF ANTICIPATED RETURNS AND CUSTOMER INCENTIVES, ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE DATE THAT VIDEO UNITS ARE MADE

AVAILABLE FOR SALE BY RETAILERS. REVENUES FROM THE LICENSING OF FEATURE FILMS AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ARE RECORDED WHEN THE MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE FOR TELECAST BY THE LICENSEE AND WHEN CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS ARE MET.

MERCHANDISE LICENSING ADVANCES AND GUARANTEE ROYALTY PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL ROYALTY RATE WHEN THE LICENSED PRODUCT

IS SOLD BY THE LICENSEE. NON-REFUNDABLE ADVANCES AND MINIMUM GUARANTEE ROYALTY PAYMENTS IN EXCESS OF ROYALTIES EARNED ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AT THE END OF THE CONTRACT TERM.

REVENUES FROM OUR INTERNET AND MOBILE OPERATIONS ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED. ADVERTISING REVENUES AT OUR INTERNET OPERATIONS

ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN ADVERTISEMENTS ARE VIEWED ONLINE.

TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES

ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME ON A NET BASIS.

ADVERTISING EXPENSE

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WAS $2.7 BILLION, $2.9 BILLION AND $2.6

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH ON HAND AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS.

INVESTMENTS

DEBT SECURITIES THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE POSITIVE INTENT AND

ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND REPORTED AT AMORTIZED COST. DEBT SECURITIES NOT CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER TRADING OR

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. TRADING AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN EARNINGS OR ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/ (LOSS), RESPECTIVELY. ALL OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES

ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING EITHER THE COST METHOD OR THE EQUITY METHOD.

THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS TO

DETERMINE WHETHER A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW THE COST BASIS IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. IF THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COST BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE, AND THE AMOUNT OF THE

WRITE-DOWN IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

TRANSLATION POLICY

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

FOR EURO DISNEY, HONG KONG DISNEYLAND, JETIX AND INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS OF THE DISNEY STORES.

72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY LOCATIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

REMEASURED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR NONMONETARY BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING EACH

PERIOD, EXCEPT FOR THOSE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE NON-MONETARY BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME.

FOR LOCAL CURRENCY FUNCTIONAL LOCATIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED AT END-OF-PERIOD RATES WHILE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE

TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD. EQUITY IS TRANSLATED AT HISTORICAL RATES AND THE RESULTING CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORY

PRIMARILY INCLUDES VACATION TIMESHARE UNITS, MERCHANDISE, MATERIALS, AND SUPPLIES. CARRYING AMOUNTS OF VACATION OWNERSHIP UNITS ARE CARRIED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. CARRYING AMOUNTS OF MERCHANDISE, MATERIALS, AND SUPPLIES

INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A MOVING AVERAGE COST BASIS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.

FILM AND TELEVISION

COSTS

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS INCLUDE CAPITALIZABLE PRODUCTION COSTS, PRODUCTION OVERHEAD, INTEREST, DEVELOPMENT COSTS,

AND ACQUIRED PRODUCTION COSTS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR FAIR VALUE. ACQUIRED PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR THE COMPANYS TELEVISION AND CABLE NETWORKS ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED

AMORTIZATION, OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ACQUIRED TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE RECORDED WHEN THE LICENSE PERIOD BEGINS AND THE PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE FOR USE. MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE

EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION, PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS ARE EXPENSED BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE

CURRENT PERIODS REVENUES TO ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FROM ALL SOURCES ON AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION BASIS. ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE

OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION NETWORK SERIES, WE INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER.

FOR ACQUIRED FILM LIBRARIES, REMAINING REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO BE EARNED FOR UP TO TWENTY YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS WHICH COMPARE THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUES WITH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS EXCEED THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES IS WRITTEN OFF. FILM DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED OR HAVE NOT BEEN SET

FOR PRODUCTION WITHIN THREE YEARS ARE GENERALLY WRITTEN OFF.

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED

MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED BASED UPON

THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS REVENUES TO ULTIMATE REVENUES (THE PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD) OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD, AS APPROPRIATE. ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS INCLUDE BOTH

ADVERTISING REVENUES AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE FEES. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON OVER THE TERM OF A MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENT APPROXIMATE EACH SEASONS RIGHTS COST BASED ON THE PROJECTED

REVENUE METHOD, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED ANNUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN-OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM.

THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF NETWORK TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS IS REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS

DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE EARLY MORNING, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN, AND SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE).

THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL.

INTERNAL-USE

SOFTWARE COSTS

THE COMPANY EXPENSES COSTS INCURRED IN THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE OF DEVELOPING OR ACQUIRING INTERNAL

USE SOFTWARE, SUCH AS RESEARCH AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES, AS WELL AS COSTS INCURRED IN THE POST-IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONAL STAGE, SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING. CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OCCURS ONLY AFTER THE

73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PRELIMINARY-PROJECT STAGE IS COMPLETE, MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZES THE PROJECT, AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETED AND THE SOFTWARE WILL BE USED FOR THE FUNCTION INTENDED. AS OF

OCTOBER 3, 2009 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS, NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION, TOTALED $595 MILLION AND $526 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF

THE SOFTWARE, RANGING FROM 3-10 YEARS.

SOFTWARE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS

SOFTWARE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCURRED PRIOR TO REACHING TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY ARE EXPENSED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL

FEASIBILITY OF THE SOFTWARE IS NOT ESTABLISHED UNTIL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS COMPLETE.

PARKS, RESORTS AND OTHER PROPERTY

PARKS, RESORTS, AND OTHER PROPERTY ARE CARRIED AT HISTORICAL COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED ON THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD

OVER ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AS FOLLOWS.

ATTRACTIONS

25  40 YEARS

BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS

20  40 YEARS

LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS

LIFE OF LEASE OR ASSET LIFE IF LESS

LAND IMPROVEMENTS

20  40 YEARS

3  25 YEARS

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO TEST GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND BETWEEN ANNUAL

TESTS IF CURRENT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE AN INTERIM IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE REPORTING LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY COMPARES

THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE

OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) TECHNIQUE CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. WE APPLY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR

REPORTING UNITS. WE INCLUDE IN THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUE WE BELIEVE THE REPORTING UNIT WOULD RECEIVE IF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE REPORTING UNIT THAT IS BEING USED BY OTHER REPORTING UNITS WAS LICENSED TO

AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AT ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS THOSE INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS.

IN LIGHT OF RECENT ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A GREATER DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED

DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES. BECAUSE OF THE WAY THE ACCOUNTING RULES WORK, A RELATIVELY

MODEST REDUCTION IN OUR ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR BROADCASTING REPORTING UNIT COULD RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE.

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR

VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.

DURING THE CURRENT YEAR, THE COMPANY TESTED ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE COMPANY RECORDED NON-CASH

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $142 MILLION FOR FCC RADIO LICENSES. DURING FISCAL YEARS 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $39 MILLION AND $26 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO FCC RADIO LICENSES. THE FCC RADIO LICENSE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REFLECTED OVERALL MARKET DECLINES IN CERTAIN RADIO MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. THE FCC RADIO LICENSE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, WHICH WERE ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WERE RECORDED IN RESTRUCTURING

AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

74

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH ARE COPYRIGHTS, ARE GENERALLY AMORTIZED

ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER PERIODS OF UP TO 31 YEARS.

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST

RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS; FORWARD, OPTION AND SWAPTION CONTRACTS AND INTEREST RATE CAPS.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND

STRATEGIES FOR UNDERTAKING VARIOUS HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DERIVATIVES INTO WHICH THE COMPANY ENTERS: HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AND HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE. HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE

THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED ASSET, LIABILITY, OR A FIRM COMMITMENT. HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION (E.G. FORECASTED REVENUE) OR THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED,

RELATED TO A RECOGNIZED LIABILITY OR ASSET (E.G. FLOATING RATE DEBT).

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES AND ASSIGNS THE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFIC ASSETS OR SPECIFIC LIABILITIES. WHEN HEDGED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE SOLD OR EXTINGUISHED OR THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES

THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED HEDGING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OPTION PREMIUMS AND UNREALIZED GAINS ON FORWARD CONTRACTS

AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS OTHER ASSETS. UNREALIZED LOSSES ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LIABILITIES. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES

THE DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS AS INTEREST RATES AND EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIVES OF THE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE TERMINATION

OF EFFECTIVE SWAP AGREEMENTS, PRIOR TO THEIR ORIGINAL MATURITY, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THESE CONTRACTS

ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET CERTAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURES OF THE COMPANY AND ARE CARRIED AT MARKET VALUE WITH ANY CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS UNDER THE

SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (SEE NOTES 9 AND 17).

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND WHEN APPROPRIATE, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

RECORDED WITH RESPECT TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IN THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF ITEMS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. WHERE, BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME AMOUNT OF

RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THAT AMOUNT THAT, IN MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, IS SUFFICIENT TO REDUCE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING A MINIMUM PROBABILITY

THRESHOLD THAT A TAX POSITION MUST MEET BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY,

INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING

REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS GUIDANCE ON ITS INCOME TAX POSITIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2008 WHICH RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS OF $148 MILLION AND $15 MILLION TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS AND MINORITY INTERESTS,

RESPECTIVELY.

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EARNINGS PER SHARE

THE COMPANY PRESENTS BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AMOUNTS. BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR.

DILUTED EPS IS BASED UPON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR WHICH IS CALCULATED USING THE TREASURY-STOCK METHOD FOR EQUITY-BASED AWARDS AND ASSUMES CONVERSION OF THE COMPANYS

CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES WHICH WERE REDEEMED DURING FISCAL 2008 (SEE NOTE 12). COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION IN PERIODS FOR WHICH THEY HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT. STOCK OPTIONS FOR WHICH THE EXERCISE PRICE EXCEEDS THE

AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OVER THE PERIOD ARE ANTI-DILUTIVE AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION.

A RECONCILIATION

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE ON REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES EFFECTIVE

FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL YEAR, ALTHOUGH EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE GUIDANCE REVISES THE CRITERIA FOR SEPARATING, MEASURING, AND ALLOCATING ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION TO EACH DELIVERABLE IN A MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT. THE GUIDANCE

REQUIRES COMPANIES TO ALLOCATE REVENUE USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE OF EACH DELIVERABLE, WHICH MUST BE ESTIMATED IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A HISTORY OF SELLING THE DELIVERABLE ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS OR THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE OF SELLING PRICE.

THE COMPANY IS ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF THIS GUIDANCE ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS TO ELIMINATE THE CONCEPT OF A

QUALIFYING SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY, CHANGE THE REQUIREMENTS FOR OFF BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTING FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS INCLUDING LIMITING THE CIRCUMSTANCES WHERE OFF BALANCE SHEET TREATMENT FOR A PORTION OF A FINANCIAL ASSET IS ALLOWABLE, AND REQUIRE

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO REVISE THE APPROACH TO DETERMINE WHEN A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED. THE NEW CONSOLIDATION MODEL FOR VIES CONSIDERS WHETHER THE COMPANY HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT THE

ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE VIES ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND SHARES IN THE SIGNIFICANT RISKS AND

76

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REWARDS OF THE ENTITY. THE GUIDANCE ON VIES REQUIRES COMPANIES TO CONTINUALLY REASSESS VIES TO DETERMINE IF CONSOLIDATION IS APPROPRIATE AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES. THE GUIDANCE IS

EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2011 FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY IS ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF THIS GUIDANCE WILL HAVE,ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT

DEFINES COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS. A COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT IS A CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT THAT INVOLVES A JOINT OPERATING ACTIVITY, FOR EXAMPLE AN AGREEMENT TO CO-PRODUCE

AND DISTRIBUTE A MOTION PICTURE WITH ANOTHER STUDIO. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2010 FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE ON COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT ESTABLISHES PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR DETERMINING HOW A COMPANY RECOGNIZES AND MEASURES THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN A

BUSINESS COMBINATION, INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, AND CERTAIN ACQUIRED CONTINGENCIES. THE GUIDANCE ON BUSINESS COMBINATIONS ALSO REQUIRES ACQUISITION-RELATED TRANSACTION EXPENSES AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS BE EXPENSED

AS INCURRED RATHER THAN CAPITALIZED. THIS GUIDANCE WILL BE APPLICABLE PROSPECTIVELY TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS BEGINNING IN THE COMPANYS 2010 FISCAL YEAR.

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST (MINORITY INTEREST)

IN

DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR A NONCONTROLLING INTEREST IN A SUBSIDIARY. UPON ADOPTION OF THIS GUIDANCE, THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPORT ITS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO PRESENT NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY SEPARATELY IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

CURRENTLY, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS ARE REPORTED BETWEEN LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE COMPANYS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND THE RELATED INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS IS REFLECTED AS AN EXPENSE IN

ARRIVING AT NET INCOME. THE GUIDANCE IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2010 FISCAL YEAR AND REQUIRES RETROACTIVE ADOPTION OF THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR EXISTING NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS. ALL OTHER REQUIREMENTS ARE TO BE

APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY.

EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION  RETIREMENT BENEFITS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CHANGES IN THAT FUNDED STATUS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR. THE GUIDANCE ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS ALSO

REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF THE FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE RECOGNITION PROVISION IN FISCAL YEAR 2007 WHICH RESULTED IN A $261 MILLION CHARGE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY

ADOPTED THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISION BY REMEASURING PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2009. ADOPTION OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF $35 MILLION TO RETAINED EARNINGS AND A $100 MILLION

BENEFIT TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR THE MEASUREMENT OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL PLANS AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2009 WERE 7.80% FOR THE DISCOUNT RATE, 7.50% FOR THE RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, AND 5.00% FOR SALARY INCREASES. BASED ON THIS MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL COSTS DECREASED TO APPROXIMATELY $214 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 COMPARED TO $255 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2008. THE DECREASE IN PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE

PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY REMEASURED PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT OCTOBER 3, 2009 IN

ACCORDANCE WITH NEW GUIDANCE ON ACCOUNTING FOR RETIREMENT PLANS. KEY ASSUMPTIONS FOR THE MEASUREMENT AT OCTOBER 3, 2009 WERE 5.75% FOR THE DISCOUNT RATE, 7.75% FOR THE RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, AND 4.50% FOR SALARY INCREASES. BASED ON THE

MEASUREMENT AT OCTOBER 3, 2009, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE, WHICH TOTALS $2.8 BILLION ($1.8 BILLION AFTER-TAX) AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009.

INCOME TAX

IN JULY 2006,

THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE WHICH CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING A MINIMUM PROBABILITY THRESHOLD THAT A TAX POSITION MUST MEET BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED AS A TAX

POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE

77

TABLE OF CONTENTS

APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS

THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE GUIDANCE ON INCOME TAXES AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. APPLYING THE GUIDANCE ON INCOME TAXES TO ALL

TAX POSITIONS UPON ADOPTION RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS OF $148 MILLION AND $15 MILLION TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS AND MINORITY INTERESTS, RESPECTIVELY.

ACQUISITIONS

A&E / LIFETIME

ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2009, THE COMPANY AND THE HEARST CORPORATION (HEARST) BOTH CONTRIBUTED THEIR 50% INTERESTS IN LIFETIME ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES LLC (LIFETIME) TO A&E TELEVISION NETWORKS, LLC (AETN) IN

EXCHANGE FOR AN INCREASED INTEREST IN AETN. PRIOR TO THIS TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY AND HEARST EACH HELD 37.5% OF AETN WHILE NBC UNIVERSAL (NBCU) HELD 25%. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR THE TRANSACTION AS A SALE OF A PORTION OF ITS INTEREST IN LIFETIME

WHICH RESULTED IN A $228 MILLION NON-CASH PRE-TAX GAIN ($142 MILLION AFTER-TAX) REFLECTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE COMPANYS CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE LIFETIME INTEREST SOLD AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INCREMENTAL AETN INTEREST RECEIVED.

FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTION THE COMPANYS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE COMBINED AETN/LIFETIME IS APPROXIMATELY 42%. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, NBCU MAY ELECT OR BE REQUIRED TO EXIT THE COMBINED AETN/LIFETIME OVER A PERIOD OF UP TO 15 YEARS,

IN WHICH EVENT THE COMPANY AND HEARST WOULD EACH OWN 50%. THE COMPANY WILL ACCOUNT FOR ITS INTEREST IN THE COMBINED AETN/LIFETIME AS AN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT CONSISTENT WITH HOW IT PREVIOUSLY ACCOUNTED FOR AETN AND LIFETIME.

MARVEL

ON AUGUST 31,

2009, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT, INC. (MARVEL) IN A CASH AND STOCK TRANSACTION. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT MARVEL SHAREHOLDERS WOULD RECEIVE $30 PER SHARE IN CASH AND 0.7452 DISNEY SHARES FOR EACH

MARVEL SHARE THEY OWN. AT CLOSING, THE AMOUNT OF CASH AND STOCK WILL BE ADJUSTED IF NECESSARY SO THAT THE TOTAL VALUE OF THE DISNEY STOCK ISSUED AS MERGER CONSIDERATION BASED ON ITS TRADING VALUE AT THAT TIME IS NOT LESS THAN 40% OF THE TOTAL MERGER

CONSIDERATION. BASED UPON DISNEYS STOCK PRICE AS OF NOVEMBER 20, 2009, THE ACQUISITION PURCHASE PRICE WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION. THE ACQUISITION IS SUBJECT TO THE EFFECTIVENESS OF A REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH RESPECT TO DISNEY

SHARES TO BE ISSUED IN THE TRANSACTION AND OTHER CUSTOMARY CLOSING CONDITIONS. THE ACQUISITION IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE APPROVAL OF MARVEL SHAREHOLDERS.

JETIX EUROPE

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED AN ADDITIONAL 26% INTEREST IN JETIX EUROPE N.V., A

PUBLICLY TRADED PAN-EUROPEAN KIDS ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY, FOR APPROXIMATELY $354 MILLION (BRINGING OUR TOTAL OWNERSHIP INTEREST TO OVER 99%). THE COMPANY INTENDS TO ACQUIRE THE REMAINING OUTSTANDING SHARES THROUGH STATUTORY BUY-OUT PROCEEDINGS.

UTV

ON

MAY 9, 2008, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A 24% INTEREST (BRINGING ITS FULLY UNDILUTED INTEREST TO 37%) IN UTV SOFTWARE COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED (UTV), A MEDIA COMPANY HEADQUARTERED AND PUBLICLY TRADED IN INDIA, FOR APPROXIMATELY $197 MILLION. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH INDIAN SECURITIES REGULATIONS, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO MAKE AN OPEN TENDER OFFER TO PURCHASE UP TO AN ADDITIONAL 23% OF UTVS PUBLICLY TRADED VOTING SHARES FOR A PRICE EQUIVALENT TO THE MAY 9TH, 2008 INDIAN RUPEE

PURCHASE PRICE. IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE OPEN OFFER AND ACQUIRED AN INCREMENTAL 23% OF UTVS VOTING SHARES FOR APPROXIMATELY $138 MILLION BRINGING ITS UNDILUTED INTEREST TO 60%. DUE TO THE CHANGE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE BETWEEN

THE US DOLLAR AND THE INDIAN RUPEE FROM MAY TO NOVEMBER, THE US DOLLAR PRICE PER SHARE WAS LOWER IN NOVEMBER THAN IN MAY. UTVS FOUNDER HAS A FOUR YEAR OPTION TO BUY ALL OR A PORTION OF THE SHARES ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY DURING THE OPEN OFFER

PERIOD AT A PRICE NO LESS THAN THE COMPANYS OPEN OFFER PRICE. IF THE TRADING PRICE UPON EXERCISE OF THE OPTION EXCEEDS THE PRICE PAID BY THE COMPANY, THEN THE OPTION PRICE IS CAPPED AT THE COMPANYS OPEN OFFER PRICE PLUS A 10% ANNUAL

RETURN. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO VOTE THE SHARES SUBJECT TO THE OPTION UNTIL THE EXPIRATION OF THE OPTION AND ACCORDINGLY THE COMPANYS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN VOTING SHARES IS 48%. IN ADDITION TO THE ACQUISITION OF UTV, ON

AUGUST 5, 2008, THE COMPANY INVESTED $28 MILLION IN A UTV SUBSIDIARY, UTV GLOBAL BROADCASTING LIMITED (ALONG WITH UTV, THE UTV GROUP). THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN THE UTV GROUP IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD.

ALTHOUGH UTVS OPERATING PERFORMANCE TO DATE HAS GENERALLY BEEN CONSISTENT WITH OUR EXPECTATIONS, IN LIGHT OF RECENT

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS WE HAVE TEMPERED OUR FUTURE EXPECTATIONS. BASED ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL VALUATION OF THE UTV BUSINESS, WHICH WAS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL, WE RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TOTALING $65 MILLION IN

FISCAL 2009. THE COMPANYS CARRYING VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENT IN THE UTV GROUP OF $298

78

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MILLION SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS THE CURRENT TRADING VALUE, AND THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS INVESTMENT IN THE UTV GROUP. UTV HAS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED THAT IT IS CONSIDERING RAISING

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL WHICH COULD CONSIST OF EQUITY SHARES OF UTV STOCK, DEBENTURES OR FOREIGN CURRENCY CONVERTIBLE BONDS. IF UTV ISSUED ADDITIONAL SHARES, DEPENDING UPON THE PRICE OF THE ISSUANCE, AN INCREMENTAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENT IN UTV

GROUP COULD BE REQUIRED.

THE DISNEY STORES NORTH AMERICA

ON APRIL 30, 2008, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED CERTAIN ASSETS OF THE DISNEY STORES NORTH AMERICA FOR APPROXIMATELY $64 MILLION IN CASH FROM, AND TERMINATED ITS LONG-TERM LICENSING ARRANGEMENT FOR THE DISNEY

STORES WITH, THE CHILDRENS PLACE, THE FORMER LICENSEE. THE COMPANY ACQUIRED THE INVENTORY, LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, AND CERTAIN FIXED ASSETS OF, AND ASSUMED THE LEASES ON 229 STORES. THE COMPANY CONDUCTED THE WIND-DOWN AND CLOSURE OF AN

ADDITIONAL 88 STORES BUT DID NOT ASSUME THE LEASES ON THESE STORES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY WAIVED

ITS RIGHTS TO CERTAIN CLAIMS AGAINST THE CHILDRENS PLACE AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE RECORDED AN $18 MILLION NON-CASH GAIN FOR THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE CLAIMS. THE GAIN IS CLASSIFIED IN OTHER INCOME

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2004, EURO DISNEY, THE COMPANY, AND EURO DISNEYS LENDERS FINALIZED A MEMORANDUM OF AGREEMENT (MOA) RELATED TO

THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF EURO DISNEY (THE 2005 FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING) WHICH PROVIDED FOR NEW FINANCING AS WELL AS THE RESTRUCTURING OF EURO DISNEYS EXISTING FINANCING AT THAT TIME. THE TRANSACTIONS CONTEMPLATED BY THE MOA WERE FULLY

IMPLEMENTED ON FEBRUARY 23, 2005 WITH THE COMPLETION OF A 253 MILLION EQUITY RIGHTS OFFERING IN WHICH THE COMPANY INVESTED 100 MILLION. THE MOA INCLUDED PROVISIONS FOR DEFERRAL OF CERTAIN ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES PAYABLE



ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES FOR FISCAL 2005 THROUGH FISCAL 2009, TOTALING 125 MILLION, PAYABLE TO THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN DEFERRED AND



ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES FOR FISCAL 2007 THROUGH FISCAL 2014, OF UP TO 25 MILLION PER YEAR, ARE SUBJECT TO CONDITIONAL DEFERRAL AND

CONVERSION INTO SUBORDINATED LONG-TERM BORROWINGS IF OPERATING RESULTS DO NOT ACHIEVE SPECIFIED LEVELS. ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES FOR FISCAL 2008 AND 2007, SUBJECT TO CONDITIONAL DEFERRAL, WERE NOT DEFERRED AND HAVE BEEN PAID. BASED ON OPERATING

RESULTS AND SUBJECT TO THIRD-PARTY CONFIRMATION, THE COMPANY WILL DEFER 25 MILLION OF ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES SUBJECT TO CONDITIONAL DEFERRAL FOR FISCAL 2009

ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF ITS LOAN TO HKDL EQUAL TO THESE CONTRIBUTIONS INTO EQUITY, SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM CONVERSION AMOUNT THAT WOULD LEAVE APPROXIMATELY $128 MILLION (HK $1.0 BILLION) OF THE HKSAR LOAN TO HKDL OUTSTANDING. AT OCTOBER 3, 2009, THE

AND REWARDS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS LIVE-ACTION FILM PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITY WITH OUTSIDE INVESTORS. AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009, THE INVESTORS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE FUNDING OF THIRTY-TWO FILMS. THE CUMULATIVE INVESTMENT IN THE

SLATE BY THE INVESTORS, NET OF THE CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY THE SLATE THAT ARE RETURNED TO THE INVESTORS, IS CLASSIFIED AS BORROWINGS. INTEREST EXPENSE RECOGNIZED FROM THESE BORROWINGS IS VARIABLE AND IS DETERMINED USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD

BASED ON THE PROJECTED PROFITABILITY OF THE FILM SLATE.

THE LAST FILM OF THE SLATE WAS COMPLETED IN FISCAL 2009. THE COMPANY

HAS THE OPTION AT 5, 10 AND 15 YEARS FROM INCEPTION OF THE FILM FINANCING ARRANGEMENT TO BUY THE INVESTORS REMAINING INTEREST IN THE SLATE AT A PRICE THAT IS BASED ON THE THEN REMAINING PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS THAT THE INVESTORS WOULD

RECEIVE FROM THE SLATE. AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009, BORROWINGS UNDER THIS ARRANGEMENT TOTALED $350 MILLION.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE PRINCIPALLY RELATES TO A $328 MILLION DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR

THE MINORITY INTEREST SHARE OF OPERATING LOSSES AT EURO DISNEY. THE ULTIMATE UTILIZATION OF THE MINORITY INTEREST SHARE OF THE NET OPERATING LOSSES, WHICH HAVE AN INDEFINITE CARRYFORWARD PERIOD, WOULD NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S

CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME AS ANY INCOME TAX BENEFIT WOULD BE OFFSET BY A CHARGE TO MINORITY INTEREST IN THE INCOME STATEMENT.

AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009, THE COMPANY HAD UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OF APPROXIMATELY $124 MILLION, FOR WHICH DEFERRED TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REINVEST THESE EARNINGS FOR THE FORESEEABLE

FUTURE. IF THESE AMOUNTS WERE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES, IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHERWISE, THE COMPANY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL U.S. INCOME TAXES. DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITIES ON THESE

EARNINGS IS NOT PRACTICABLE BECAUSE SUCH LIABILITY, IF ANY, IS DEPENDENT ON CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IF AND WHEN REMITTANCE WAS TO OCCUR.

THEREAFTER. OUR TAX PROVISIONS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2009, 2008, AND 2007 REFLECT BENEFITS OF $100 MILLION, $97 MILLION AND $41 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RESULTING FROM THIS DEDUCTION.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR INCOME TAXES AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. SEE NOTE 2 FOR THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING

THIS GUIDANCE.

RESPECTIVELY, THAT IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD REDUCE OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE AFTER GIVING EFFECT TO OFFSETTING BENEFITS FROM OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS.

AS OF YEAR END 2009 AND 2008, THE COMPANY HAD $142 MILLION AND $127 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN ACCRUED INTEREST RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. DURING 2009 AND 2008, THE COMPANY ACCRUED ADDITIONAL

INTEREST OF $27 MILLION AND $47 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND RECORDED REDUCTIONS IN ACCRUED INTEREST OF $12 MILLION AND $57 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS A RESULT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS AND OTHER PRIOR-YEAR ADJUSTMENTS. THE COMPANYS POLICY IS TO

REPORT INTEREST AND PENALTIES AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

DURING THE CURRENT YEAR, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE

COMMENCED A LIMITED ISSUE FOCUSED EXAMINATION WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FILED FOR ITS FISCAL YEARS 2005 THROUGH 2007. THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO STATE AND LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX AUDITS. IN THE CURRENT YEAR, THE

CALIFORNIA EXAMINATION OF FISCAL YEARS 2004 AND 2005 WAS COMPLETED. THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION IN ANY OF ITS MAJOR STATE OR FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2002.

IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD CHANGE DUE TO PAYMENTS FOR OR RESOLUTION OF

OPEN TAX MATTERS FOR POST-2002 YEARS. THESE RESOLUTIONS AND PAYMENTS WOULD REDUCE OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS BY $109 MILLION.

IN FISCAL 2009, INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS WERE LESS THAN THE AMOUNTS RECORDED BASED ON GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, A SHORTFALL OF $26 MILLION WAS CHARGED TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

IN FISCAL YEARS 2008 AND 2007, INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS EXCEEDED AMOUNTS RECORDED AT GRANT DATE AND ACCORDINGLY WERE CREDITED TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND TOTALED $45 MILLION AND $123 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY .

PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PROGRAMS

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS COVERING MOST OF ITS

EMPLOYEES NOT COVERED BY UNION OR INDUSTRY-WIDE PLANS. EMPLOYEES HIRED AFTER JANUARY 1, 1994 AND EMPLOYEES GENERALLY HIRED AFTER JANUARY 1, 1987 FOR CERTAIN OF OUR MEDIA BUSINESSES ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. WITH

RESPECT TO ITS QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, THE COMPANYS POLICY IS TO FUND, AT A MINIMUM, THE AMOUNT NECESSARY ON AN ACTUARIAL BASIS TO PROVIDE FOR BENEFITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME

SECURITY ACT OF 1974, AS AMENDED BY THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 (PPA). PENSION BENEFITS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON YEARS OF SERVICE AND/OR COMPENSATION.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED NEW ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE ON RETIREMENT BENEFITS THAT REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF PLAN FUNDED STATUS AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. PREVIOUSLY, THE MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE PLANS WAS

JUNE 30. UPON ADOPTION, THE COMPANY REMEASURED PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT THE END OF FISCAL 2008 WHICH RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF $35 MILLION TO RETAINED EARNINGS AND A $100 MILLION BENEFIT TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2009. NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST FOR FISCAL 2009 WAS BASED ON THIS REMEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. THE AMOUNTS IN THE TABLES BELOW FOR FISCAL 2009 REFLECT AN OCTOBER 3, 2009 MEASUREMENT DATE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSUMPTIONS

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS THE DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE, HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR NET PERIODIC BENEFIT

COST AS WELL AS THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

DISCOUNT RATE

 THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE FOR PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS REFLECTS THE MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH

QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

 THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM RETURNS ON AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTING OF A MIXTURE OF EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME AND ALTERNATIVE

INVESTMENTS. WHEN DETERMINING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON THE ASSET CLASSES (BOTH HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED) IN WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE PENSION FUNDS TO BE INVESTED. THE

FOLLOWING LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN BY ASSET CLASS WERE CONSIDERED IN SETTING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION.

EQUITY SECURITIES

9%  11%

DEBT SECURITIES

4%    8%

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS

8%  20%

HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE

 THE COMPANY REVIEWS EXTERNAL DATA AND ITS

OWN HISTORICAL TRENDS FOR HEALTHCARE COSTS TO DETERMINE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATES FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS. FOR THE 2009 ACTUARIAL VALUATION, WE ASSUMED AN 8.5% ANNUAL RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED

HEALTHCARE CLAIMS WITH THE RATE DECREASING IN EVEN INCREMENTS OVER TEN YEARS UNTIL REACHING 5.0%.

SENSITIVITY

 A

ONE PERCENTAGE POINT (PPT) CHANGE IN THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS WOULD HAVE HAD THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS ON THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009 AND ON COST FOR FISCAL 2010.

EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

UNDER VARIOUS PLANS, THE COMPANY MAY GRANT STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY-BASED AWARDS TO EXECUTIVE,

MANAGEMENT, AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL. THE COMPANYS APPROACH TO LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION CONTEMPLATES AWARDS OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS). CERTAIN RSUS AWARDED TO SENIOR EXECUTIVES VEST BASED UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF

MARKET AND/OR PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS (PERFORMANCE RSUS).

STOCK OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY GRANTED AT EXERCISE PRICES EQUAL TO OR

EXCEEDING THE MARKET PRICE AT THE DATE OF GRANT. EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2003, OPTIONS BECAME EXERCISABLE RATABLY OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE GRANT DATE, WHILE OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 2003 GENERALLY VEST RATABLY OVER FIVE YEARS. EFFECTIVE

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005, OPTIONS GRANTED GENERALLY EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE, WHILE OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005 GENERALLY EXPIRE TEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE. AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OPTIONS CAN OCCASIONALLY EXTEND UP TO 15 YEARS AFTER DATE OF GRANT. EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2009, RSUS (EXCLUDING PERFORMANCE RSUS) VEST RATABLY OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT, WHILE

RSUS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 2009 AND PERFORMANCE RSUS GENERALLY VEST 50% ON EACH OF THE SECOND AND FOURTH ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT DATE. STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS ARE GENERALLY FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES WHO TERMINATE PRIOR TO VESTING. SHARES AVAILABLE

FOR FUTURE OPTION AND RSU GRANTS AT OCTOBER 3, 2009 TOTALED 83 MILLION. STARTING MARCH 2009 FOR OUR PRIMARY PLAN, EACH SHARE GRANTED SUBJECT TO A STOCK OPTION AWARD REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE BY ONE SHARE WHILE EACH SHARE GRANTED

SUBJECT TO A RSU AWARD REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE BY TWO SHARES. THE COMPANY SATISFIES STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF RSUS WITH NEWLY ISSUED SHARES.

95

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EACH YEAR, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY AWARDS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS TO A BROAD-BASED GROUP OF MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL (THE ANNUAL GRANT). THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS VOLATILITY,

DIVIDEND YIELD, AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE (THE MULTIPLE OF EXERCISE PRICE TO GRANT PRICE AT WHICH EXERCISES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON AVERAGE) AND THE TERMINATION RATE

(THE PROBABILITY OF A VESTED OPTION BEING CANCELLED DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE OPTION HOLDER) IN COMPUTING THE VALUE OF THE OPTION.

IN FISCAL YEARS 2009, 2008 AND 2007, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OPTION-VALUATION MODEL WERE AS FOLLOWS.

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS NOT ADJUSTED AFTER THE GRANT

DATE, CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE THE VALUE OF, AND THEREFORE THE EXPENSE RELATED TO, FUTURE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE GREATEST VARIATION IN FAIR VALUE IN THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ARE THE

EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN EITHER THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE WILL CAUSE THE BINOMIAL OPTION VALUE TO INCREASE OR DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION CONSIDERS BOTH HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS

CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS (EXCLUDING PERFORMANCE RSUS) AND STOCK OPTIONS IS

RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE AWARD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS IS BASED UPON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE AWARDS ON THE GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR PERFORMANCE RSUS REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITY

THAT THE MARKET AND/OR PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS WILL BE MET AND IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD.

IN ANTICIPATION OF THE ABC RADIO TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY NEEDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER EMPLOYEE EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS WOULD BE ADJUSTED FOR

THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE TRANSACTION ON OUTSTANDING EMPLOYEE AWARDS. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS PLANS REQUIRED SUCH ADJUSTMENTS TO BE MADE ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS. ALL OTHER PLANS PERMITTED SUCH ADJUSTMENTS TO BE MADE. IN ORDER TO TREAT ALL

EMPLOYEES CONSISTENTLY WITH RESPECT TO THE ABC RADIO TRANSACTION (AND OTHER SIMILAR FUTURE TRANSACTIONS), THE COMPANY AMENDED THE PLANS SUCH THAT ALL PLANS REQUIRE EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENTS FOR SUCH TRANSACTIONS. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE AMENDMENTS, THE

COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO RECORD A NON-CASH CHARGE OF $48 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007 REPRESENTING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THIS MODIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO VESTED EQUITY-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AWARDS.

LEGAL MATTERS

MILNE AND DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. V. STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC.

ON NOVEMBER 5, 2002, CLARE MILNE, THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A. A. MILNE, AUTHOR OF THE WINNIE THE POOH BOOKS, AND THE COMPANYS

SUBSIDIARY DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. (DEI) FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. (SSI) IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2002, MS. MILNE SERVED NOTICES TO SSI AND DEI

TERMINATING A. A. MILNES PRIOR GRANT OF RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004, AND GRANTED ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS TO DEI. IN THEIR LAWSUIT, MS. MILNE AND DEI SOUGHT A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, UNDER UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT

LAW, THAT MS. MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE VALID; THAT SSIS RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH IN THE UNITED STATES TERMINATED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004; THAT UPON TERMINATION OF SSIS RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 1983

LICENSING AGREEMENT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

LAWSUIT (THE STATE COURT ACTION) TERMINATED BY OPERATION OF LAW; AND THAT, AS OF NOVEMBER 5, 2004, SSI WAS ENTITLED TO NO

FURTHER ROYALTIES FOR USES OF WINNIE THE POOH. SSI FILED (A) AN ANSWER DENYING THE MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT AND (B) COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT (I) MS. MILNES GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI IS VOID AND

UNENFORCEABLE AND (II) DEI REMAINS OBLIGATED TO PAY SSI ROYALTIES UNDER THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT. THE DISTRICT COURT RULED THAT MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE INVALID. THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED, AND ON

JUNE 26, 2006, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DENIED MILNES PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI. ON AUGUST 1, 2003, SSI FILED AN AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS AND A THIRD-PARTY COMPLAINT AGAINST HARRIET HUNT (HEIR TO E. H. SHEPARD,

ILLUSTRATOR OF THE ORIGINAL WINNIE THE POOH STORIES), WHO HAD SERVED A NOTICE OF TERMINATION AND A GRANT OF RIGHTS SIMILAR TO MS. MILNES, AND ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE MILNE AND HUNT

TERMINATIONS AND THE GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI FOR (A) UNLAWFUL AND UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES; AND (B) BREACH OF THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT.

ON OCTOBER 19, 2006, THE PARTIES STIPULATED TO SSI'S FILING ITS FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS (FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER) SEEKING (A) TO INVALIDATE THE HUNT TERMINATION NOTICE, (B) TO

TERMINATE THE COMPANY'S RIGHTS VIS-À-VIS SSI, AND (C) DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS, AMONG OTHER RELIEF. THAT STIPULATION ALSO PROVIDED THAT HUNT AND THE COMPANY NEED NOT RESPOND TO THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER UNTIL THE

CONCLUSION OF TWO EVENTS: THE STATE COURT APPEAL IN

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

, AND THE TRIAL IN THE DISTRICT COURT ON THE VALIDITY OF THE HUNT TERMINATION NOTICE. SSI THEN SOUGHT TO WITHDRAW BOTH THE FOURTH AMENDED

ANSWER AND ITS STIPULATION, BUT ON NOVEMBER 3, 2006, THE DISTRICT COURT DENIED THAT REQUEST. SSIS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE VALIDITY OF HUNTS 2002 ATTEMPT TO RECAPTURE E. H. SHEPARDS RIGHTS WAS GRANTED ON

FEBRUARY 15, 2007, AND THEREAFTER, ON MARCH 27, 2007, THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED AS MOOT ALL CLAIMS AGAINST HUNT AND THREE OF SSIS COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY RELATED TO THE COMPANYS AGREEMENTS WITH MILNE AND HUNT

CONCERNING THE TERMINATION AND DISPOSITION OF THEIR RIGHTS. ON JANUARY 3, 2008, THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DENIED SSIS PETITION FOR REVIEW IN THE STATE COURT ACTION, WHEREUPON ON APRIL 21, 2008, THE COMPANY MOVED FOR SUMMARY

JUDGMENT ON ALL OF SSI'S CLAIMS IN THE DISTRICT COURT ACTION. ON JUNE 3, 2008, THE DISTRICT COURT ORDERED FURTHER BRIEFING ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER SSIS MISCONDUCT IN THE STATE COURT ACTION WARRANTS DISMISSAL OF ALL OF ITS CLAIMS IN THE

DISTRICT COURT, AND THEN ON JULY 29, 2008, THE DISTRICT COURT REFERRED THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION TO A SPECIAL MASTER, WHO RENDERED A SEALED RECOMMENDATION ON MARCH 26, 2009. ON MAY 19, 2009, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THE

COMPANYS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND DISMISSED WITHOUT PREJUDICE SSIS FOUR CONTRACT AND FRAUD COUNTERCLAIMS AND INVITED THE PARTIES TO FILE SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTIONS ON THE REMAINING INFRINGEMENT AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLAIMS. ON

SEPTEMBER 25, 2009, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON SSIS REMAINING CLAIMS AND ON OCTOBER 21, 2009, SSI AND THE COMPANY FILED APPLICATIONS FOR ATTORNEYS FEES. ON NOVEMBER 5,

2009, SSI APPEALED FROM THE DISTRICT COURTS JUDGMENT TO THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT.

SEEKING CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH TRADEMARK REGISTRATIONS AND OPPOSING APPLICATIONS FOR OTHER WINNIE THE POOH TRADEMARKS. PRIOR TO JULY 27, THE PTO HAD ALREADY SUSPENDED THE THEN-PENDING PROCEEDINGS ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE RELIEF

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS WHICH PROVIDES A COMMON DEFINITION

OF FAIR VALUE AND ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK TO MAKE THE MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE IN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES MORE CONSISTENT AND COMPARABLE. THIS GUIDANCE ALSO REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXTENT TO

WHICH FAIR VALUE IS USED TO MEASURE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE, AND THE EFFECT OF FAIR VALUE MEASURES ON EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE GUIDANCE AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2009 FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MADE ON

A RECURRING BASIS. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB UPDATED THE GUIDANCE, WHICH DELAYS THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR ALL NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND NONFINANCIAL LIABILITIES UNTIL THE COMPANYS 2010 FISCAL YEAR. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF THE GUIDANCE FOR NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND NONFINANCIAL LIABILITIES WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FOR SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION

BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND REQUIRES THAT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE BE CLASSIFIED AND DISCLOSED IN THE FOLLOWING THREE CATEGORIES.



LEVEL 1  QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS



LEVEL 2  QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT

ACTIVE; AND MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS IN WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS AND SIGNIFICANT VALUE DRIVERS ARE OBSERVABLE IN ACTIVE MARKETS



LEVEL 3  VALUATIONS DERIVED FROM VALUATION TECHNIQUES IN WHICH ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS OR SIGNIFICANT VALUE DRIVERS ARE UNOBSERVABLE

THE COMPANYS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS BY COUNTERPARTY WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. CONTRACTS IN A LIABILITY POSITION

TOTALING $170 MILLION HAVE BEEN NETTED AGAINST CONTRACTS IN AN ASSET POSITION IN THE CONDENSED CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO MARKET PRICES BASED ON RECENT TRADING ACTIVITY AND OTHER RELEVANT INFORMATION INCLUDING PRICING FOR SIMILAR SECURITIES AS

DETERMINED BY THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES.

THE FAIR VALUES OF LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES, WHICH CONSIST OF INTEREST RATE AND

FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES, ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS USING INTERNAL MODELS THAT USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK,

WHICH IS MITIGATED BY MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERAL POSTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES.

LEVEL 3 RESIDUAL INTERESTS CONSIST OF OUR RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED VACATION OWNERSHIP MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES AND ARE VALUED USING A

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT CONSIDERS ESTIMATED INTEREST RATES, DISCOUNT RATES, PREPAYMENT, AND DEFAULTS. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE RESIDUAL INTERESTS IN FISCAL 2009.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

IN ADDITION TO THE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS LISTED ABOVE, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ALSO INCLUDE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND BORROWINGS.

THE FAIR VALUES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUES. THE ESTIMATED YEAR END FAIR VALUES OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE

TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE TO EXPAND DISCLOSURE ABOUT TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS.

THROUGH DECEMBER 4, 2008, THE COMPANY SOLD MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE SALES OF ITS VACATION OWNERSHIP UNITS UNDER A FACILITY

THAT EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 4, 2008 AND WAS NOT RENEWED. THE COMPANY SOLD $17 MILLION AND $147 MILLION OF MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES DURING THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 3, 2009, AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH RESULTED IN

GAINS TOTALING $4 MILLION AND $32 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2009 AND FISCAL 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SERVICE THE

SOLD RECEIVABLES AND HAS A RESIDUAL INTEREST IN THOSE RECEIVABLES. AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009, THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AMOUNT FOR SOLD MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES WAS $399 MILLION AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS RESIDUAL INTEREST, WHICH IS

RECORDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS, WAS $64 MILLION.

THE COMPANY REPURCHASES DEFAULTED MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES AT THEIR

OUTSTANDING BALANCE. THE COMPANY DID NOT MAKE MATERIAL REPURCHASES IN THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 3, 2009 OR SEPTEMBER 27, 2008. THE COMPANY GENERALLY HAS BEEN ABLE TO SELL THE REPURCHASED VACATION OWNERSHIP UNITS FOR AMOUNTS THAT EXCEED THE

AMOUNTS AT WHICH THEY WERE REPURCHASED.

THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES CREDIT SUPPORT FOR THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF THE SOLD

MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES WHICH THE MORTGAGE RECEIVABLE ACQUIRER MAY DRAW ON IN THE EVENT OF LOSSES UNDER THE FACILITY. DURING FISCAL 2009, THE COMPANY AMENDED CERTAIN TERMS OF ITS AGREEMENT WITH THE MORTGAGE RECEIVABLE ACQUIRER INCLUDING A PROVISION FOR

THE COMPANY TO PROVIDE SUPPORT FOR UP TO 70% OF THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE OF SOLD MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A RESERVE FOR ESTIMATED CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO THESE RECEIVABLES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS WITH, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE COUNTERPARTIES TO ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY

THE COUNTERPARTIES. IN 2008, LEHMAN BROTHERS COMMERCIAL CORPORATION DEFAULTED ON A $91 MILLION TRADE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY IS PURSUING COLLECTION OF THIS AMOUNT, BUT HAS FULLY RESERVED THE AMOUNT.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT IT WOULD REALIZE A MATERIAL LOSS, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS OF

OCTOBER 3, 2009, IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY SINGLE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS ONLY WITH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF A- OR BETTER. THE COMPANYS CURRENT POLICY

REGARDING AGREEMENTS WITH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES IS GENERALLY TO REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A- OR IN THE EVENT AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED LIMITS AS DEFINED BY CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF

INVESTMENT CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE MATERIAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES

WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF LESS THAN A-. AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009, THE COMPANYS BALANCES THAT EXCEEDED 10% OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WERE 38% COMPARED TO 63% AS OF

SEPTEMBER 27, 2008.

THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES AND FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AT OCTOBER 3, 2009 DUE TO THE WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS INTO WHICH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD, THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO

AMONG ISSUERS.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS RISKS RELATING TO ITS ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS ACCORDING TO A

RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY. THE PRIMARY RISKS MANAGED WITH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTEREST RATE RISK AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS BORROWING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND ON THE MARKET VALUE OF

ITS INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS ITS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY USES PAY-FLOATING AND PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE

SWAPS TO FACILITATE ITS INTEREST RATE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES PAY-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS FAIR

VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS EFFECTIVELY CONVERTING FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS TO VARIABLE RATE BORROWINGS INDEXED TO LIBOR. AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS PAY-FLOATING

INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS $1.6 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2009 AND FISCAL 2008, $105 MILLION AND $68 MILLION IN GAINS, RESPECTIVELY, FROM MARK TO MARKET ADJUSTMENTS ON PAY-FLOATING SWAPS AND AN OFFSETTING $105 MILLION AND $68 MILLION IN LOSSES,

RESPECTIVELY, FROM MARK TO MARKET ADJUSTMENTS ON HEDGED BORROWINGS WERE INCLUDED IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, RESPECTIVELY.

104

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF INTEREST

PAYMENTS ON FLOATING-RATE BORROWINGS. PAY-FIXED SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FLOATING RATE BORROWINGS TO FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS. THE UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THESE CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE DEFERRED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) AND

RECOGNIZED AS THE INTEREST PAYMENTS OCCUR. THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THESE CONTRACTS AT OCTOBER 3, 2009 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND THE GAINS OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN INCOME FOR THE YEARS THEN ENDED WERE NOT MATERIAL.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY TRANSACTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ENABLING MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OPTION AND

FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, FIRM COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY HEDGES ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS FOR PERIODS GENERALLY NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM RANGE OF ANNUAL EXPOSURE. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET

CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED FORECASTED TRANSACTION, ASSET, LIABILITY OR FIRM COMMITMENT. THE PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO

EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BORROWINGS INTO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS.

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES

FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FIRMLY COMMITTED AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. AS OF OCTOBER 3, 2009 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS NET FOREIGN

EXCHANGE CASH FLOW HEDGES WAS $2.8 BILLION AND $2.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. MARK TO MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS ARE DEFERRED IN AOCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS OCCUR, OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF

THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED GAINS OF $81 MILLION AND LOSSES OF $12 MILLION IN AOCI ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES FOR THE YEARS ENDED OCTOBER 3, 2009 AND SEPTEMBER 27, 2008,

RESPECTIVELY. GAINS OF $183 MILLION AND LOSSES OF $200 MILLION WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM AOCI INTO REVENUE AND COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR FISCAL 2009 AND FISCAL 2008, RESPECTIVELY. GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED RELATED TO INEFFECTIVENESS FOR THE YEARS ENDED
