WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME, THE BROADCASTING OPERATIONS, CERTAIN OF OUR CABLE NETWORKS AND OUR RADIO STATIONS COMPETE WITH OTHER TELEVISION NETWORKS AND RADIO STATIONS, INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATIONS, CABLE SERVICE PROVIDERS AND

OTHER ADVERTISING MEDIA SUCH AS NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, BILLBOARDS, AND THE INTERNET. FOR OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS, COMPETITION OCCURS PRIMARILY IN INDIVIDUAL MARKET AREAS. A TELEVISION OR RADIO STATION IN ONE MARKET GENERALLY DOES NOT

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH CABLE SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE RENEWED OR RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE CABLE AND SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS VARIOUS CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE.

COMPETITIVE, PARTICULARLY FOR SPORTS PROGRAMMING. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS SPORTS RIGHTS AGREEMENTS WITH THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE (NFL), NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION (NBA), NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF STOCK CAR AUTO RACING (NASCAR), MAJOR LEAGUE

BASEBALL (MLB), WORLD CUP, INDY RACING LEAGUE AND VARIOUS COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL CONFERENCES.

THE COMPANYS INTERNET WEB

SITES AND PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH OTHER WEB SITES AND PRODUCTS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CATEGORIES, WHICH INCLUDE KIDS, FAMILY, ENTERTAINMENT, SPORTS AND NEWS, AMONG OTHERS.

ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE MEDIA NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER

MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS ARE MET, AND THESE COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE

COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION DURING THIS PERIOD.

FEDERAL REGULATION

TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) UNDER FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. VIOLATION

OF FCC REGULATIONS CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY FORFEITURES, LIMITED RENEWALS OF LICENSES AND, IN EGREGIOUS CASES, DENIAL OF LICENSE RENEWAL OR REVOCATION OF A LICENSE. FCC REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING.



LICENSING OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS.

EACH OF THE TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE OWN MUST BE LICENSED BY THE FCC. THESE LICENSES ARE GRANTED FOR

PERIODS OF UP TO EIGHT YEARS, AND WE MUST OBTAIN RENEWAL OF LICENSES AS THEY EXPIRE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OPERATING THE STATIONS. WE (OR THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN THE CASE OF A DIVESTITURE) MUST ALSO OBTAIN FCC APPROVAL WHENEVER WE SEEK TO HAVE A

LICENSE TRANSFERRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OR DIVESTITURE OF A STATION. THE FCC MAY DECLINE TO RENEW OR APPROVE THE TRANSFER OF A LICENSE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE GENERALLY RECEIVED SUCH RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE

PAST, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ALWAYS OBTAIN NECESSARY RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE FUTURE.



TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP LIMITS.

THE FCC IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SPECIFIC

MARKET, ON THE COMBINED NUMBER OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SINGLE MARKET AND ON THE AGGREGATE PERCENTAGE OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE THAT CAN BE REACHED BY TELEVISION STATIONS WE OWN. CURRENTLY.



FCC REGULATIONS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN A MARKET, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND NATURE OF THE MARKET. WE DO NOT OWN MORE

THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN ANY OF THE TEN MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN A TELEVISION STATION.



FEDERAL STATUTES PERMIT OUR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE AGGREGATE TO REACH A MAXIMUM OF 39% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE (FOR THIS PURPOSE, FCC REGULATIONS ATTRIBUTE TO

UHF TELEVISION STATIONS ONLY 50% OF THE TELEVISION HOUSEHOLDS IN THEIR MARKET). OUR STATIONS REACH APPROXIMATELY 23% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE.



FCC REGULATIONS IN SOME CASES IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL RADIO OR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN RADIO STATIONS,

BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS ARE MATERIAL TO OUR CURRENT OPERATING PLANS.



DUAL NETWORKS.

FCC RULES CURRENTLY PROHIBIT ANY OF THE FOUR MAJOR TELEVISION NETWORKS  ABC, CBS, FOX AND NBC  FROM BEING UNDER COMMON OWNERSHIP

OR CONTROL.



REGULATION OF PROGRAMMING.

THE FCC REGULATES BROADCAST PROGRAMMING BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BANNING INDECENT PROGRAMMING, REGULATING POLITICAL

ADVERTISING AND IMPOSING COMMERCIAL TIME LIMITS DURING CHILDRENS PROGRAMMING. BROADCASTERS FACE A HEIGHTENED RISK OF BEING FOUND IN VIOLATION OF THE INDECENCY PROHIBITION BY THE FCC BECAUSE OF RECENT FCC DECISIONS, COUPLED WITH THE SPONTANEITY

OF LIVE PROGRAMMING. THE FCC HAS INDICATED THAT IT IS INCREASING ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO INDECENCY, AND HAS INDICATED IT WOULD CONSIDER LICENSE REVOCATION FOR SERIOUS VIOLATIONS. MOREOVER, CONGRESS RECENTLY INCREASED PENALTIES FOR

BROADCASTING INDECENT PROGRAMMING TO A MAXIMUM OF $325,000 PER VIOLATION.

FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND FCC RULES ALSO LIMIT

THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL MATTER THAT MAY BE SHOWN ON BROADCAST OR CABLE CHANNELS DURING PROGRAMMING DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN 12 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. IN ADDITION, BROADCAST CHANNELS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF THREE HOURS PER

WEEK OF PROGRAMMING THAT HAS AS A SIGNIFICANT PURPOSE MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN 16 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. FCC RULES ALSO GIVE TELEVISION STATION OWNERS THE RIGHT TO REJECT OR REFUSE NETWORK

PROGRAMMING IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO SUBSTITUTE PROGRAMMING THAT THE LICENSEE REASONABLY BELIEVES TO BE OF GREATER LOCAL OR NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.



CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS.

WITH RESPECT TO CABLE SYSTEMS OPERATING WITHIN A TELEVISION STATIONS DESIGNATED MARKET

AREA, FCC RULES REQUIRE THAT EVERY THREE YEARS EACH TELEVISION STATION ELECT EITHER MUST CARRY STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH CABLE OPERATORS GENERALLY MUST CARRY A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION IN THE STATIONS MARKET, OR

RETRANSMISSION CONSENT STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE CABLE OPERATOR MUST

GRANTED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PHASE-IN OF DIGITAL BROADCASTING. FCC RULES ALSO REGULATE DIGITAL BROADCASTING TO ENSURE CONTINUED QUALITY CARRIAGE OF MANDATED FREE OVER-THE-AIR PROGRAM SERVICE. ALL OF THE COMPANYS STATIONS HAVE LAUNCHED DIGITAL

FACILITIES, AND WE ARE EVALUATING VARIOUS OPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO USE OF DIGITAL CHANNELS. ALL BROADCASTERS ARE REQUIRED TO OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY IN DIGITAL MODE AND PERMANENTLY SURRENDER ONE OF THEIR TWO CHANNELS BY FEBRUARY 17, 2009.



CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF PROGRAMMING.

THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND FCC RULES REGULATE SOME ASPECTS OF NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING CABLE AND SATELLITE

RETRANSMISSION CONSENT AND SOME CABLE AND SATELLITE COMPANIES HAVE SOUGHT REGULATION OF ADDITIONAL ASPECTS OF THE CARRIAGE OF PROGRAMMING ON CABLE AND SATELLITE SYSTEMS. LITIGATION HAS BEEN INSTITUTED AGAINST THE COMPANY, OTHER PROGRAM PROVIDERS AND

DISTRIBUTORS SEEKING AMONG OTHER THINGS TO ACHIEVE SIMILAR ENDS. NEW LEGISLATION, COURT ACTION OR REGULATION IN THIS AREA COULD, DEPENDING ON ITS SPECIFIC NATURE, HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS.

THE FOREGOING IS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND OTHER LEGISLATION AND OF SPECIFIC FCC RULES AND POLICIES. REFERENCE

SHOULD BE MADE TO THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT, OTHER LEGISLATION, FCC RULES AND PUBLIC NOTICES AND RULINGS OF THE FCC FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FCCS REGULATORY AUTHORITY.

DISNEYSHOPPING.COM

DISNEYSHOPPING.COM OFFERS DISNEY-THEMED MERCHANDISE THROUGH AN INTERNET SITE, WHICH INCLUDES INTERNALLY DEVELOPED DISNEY MERCHANDISE

AS WELL AS MERCHANDISE FROM DISNEY LICENSEES.

COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY

THE COMPANY COMPETES IN ITS MERCHANDISE LICENSING, PUBLISHING, VIDEO GAME AND RETAIL ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER LICENSORS, PUBLISHERS AND RETAILERS OF

CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES. BASED ON INDEPENDENT SURVEYS, WE BELIEVE THE COMPANY IS THE LARGEST WORLDWIDE LICENSOR OF CHARACTER-BASED MERCHANDISE BASED ON RETAIL SALES. OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE LICENSING AND RETAIL DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS

ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF ANIMATED THEATRICAL RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION

THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD ARE AFFECTED BY ITS ABILITY TO EXPLOIT

AND PROTECT AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS AND TRADE SECRETS. IMPORTANT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INCLUDES RIGHTS IN THE CONTENT OF MOTION PICTURES, TELEVISION PROGRAMS,

ELECTRONIC GAMES, SOUND RECORDINGS, CHARACTER LIKENESSES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, BOOKS AND MAGAZINES.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

EXPLOIT AND PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS AFFECTED BY THE STRENGTH AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. INADEQUATE LAWS OR ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN ONE COUNTRY

CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE, DESPITE THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, THE FALLING PRICES OF

DEVICES INCORPORATING SUCH NEW TECHNOLOGIES, AND INCREASED

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BROADBAND INTERNET SPEED AND PENETRATION HAVE MADE INFRINGEMENT EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT MORE CHALLENGING. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DEVOTES

SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO PROTECTING ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED USE IN THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN MARKETS.

THE

COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF CHALLENGES BY THIRD PARTIES CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT OF THEIR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR VALIDITY, SUCH CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERSION OF RESOURCES WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

FOR AN ENTERPRISE AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS THE COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION

TO THE FACTORS AFFECTING SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPERATIONS IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THESE OPERATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS

INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

RECENT CHANGES IN U.S., GLOBAL, OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE A CONTINUING ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF

SOME OR ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES.

RECENT TURMOIL IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAS ADVERSELY AFFECTED ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES

AND OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT THIS IS AFFECTING DEMAND FOR SOME OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND A CONTINUED DECLINE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, THUS

REDUCING OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS. A SUSTAINED DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD REDUCE ATTENDANCE AND SPENDING AT ONE OR MORE OF OUR PARKS AND RESORTS, PURCHASE OF OR PRICES FOR ADVERTISING ON OUR BROADCAST OR CABLE NETWORKS OR OWNED STATIONS,

PRICES THAT CABLE SERVICE PROVIDERS WILL PAY FOR OUR CABLE PROGRAMMING, PERFORMANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT RELEASES, AND PURCHASES OF COMPANY-BRANDED CONSUMER PRODUCTS. THESE CONDITIONS COULD ALSO IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THOSE WITH

WHOM WE DO BUSINESS TO SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN PRICE LEVELS GENERALLY, OR IN PRICE LEVELS IN A PARTICULAR SECTOR SUCH AS THE ENERGY SECTOR, COULD RESULT IN A SHIFT IN CONSUMER DEMAND AWAY FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT

AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS WE OFFER, WHICH COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASE OUR COSTS. CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY REDUCE INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCREASE OUR LABOR OR SUPPLY

COSTS IN NON-UNITED STATES MARKETS, OR REDUCE THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR VALUE OF REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER MARKETS.

CHANGES IN PUBLIC AND CONSUMER

TASTES AND PREFERENCES FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES CREATES ENTERTAINMENT OR CONSUMER PRODUCTS WHOSE SUCCESS DEPENDS SUBSTANTIALLY ON CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES THAT CHANGE IN

OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO CONSISTENTLY CREATE AND DISTRIBUTE FILMED ENTERTAINMENT, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ONLINE MATERIAL, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, HOTELS AND OTHER

RESORT FACILITIES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE CHANGING PREFERENCES OF THE BROAD CONSUMER MARKET. MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON WORLDWIDE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND THEIR SUCCESS

THEREFORE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT AND ADAPT TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES OUTSIDE AS WELL AS INSIDE THE UNITED STATES. MOREOVER, WE MUST OFTEN INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN FILM PRODUCTION, BROADCAST AND CABLE

PROGRAMMING, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, OR HOTELS AND OTHER RESORT FACILITIES BEFORE WE LEARN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PRODUCTS WILL EARN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. IF OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT

CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, OUR REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING SALES (WHICH ARE BASED IN PART ON RATINGS FOR THE PROGRAMS IN WHICH ADVERTISEMENTS AIR) OR SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING AND ONLINE SERVICES, FROM THEATRICAL FILM

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RECEIPTS OR HOME VIDEO OR ELECTRONIC GAME SALES, FROM THEME PARK ADMISSIONS, HOTEL ROOM CHARGES AND MERCHANDISE, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES, FROM SALES OF

LICENSED CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR FROM SALES OF OUR OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY DECLINE AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES.

CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND IN CONSUMER CONSUMPTION PATTERNS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS OR THE COST OF PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTS.

THE MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE, DEVELOP, ADOPT AND EXPLOIT NEW

TECHNOLOGIES TO DISTINGUISH OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGIES AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THE TIME AND MANNER IN WHICH CONSUMERS ACQUIRE AND VIEW SOME OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND THE

OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO ADVERTISERS FOR REACHING THEIR DESIRED MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE.



THE SUCCESS OF OUR OFFERINGS IN THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET DEPENDS IN PART ON CONSUMER PREFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO HOME ENTERTAINMENT FORMATS, INCLUDING DVD

PLAYERS AND PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDERS, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE HOME ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING WEB-BASED DELIVERY OF ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS;



TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OFFER CONSUMERS AN EXPANDING ARRAY OF ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS AND IF CONSUMERS FAVOR OPTIONS WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED RATHER THAN

THE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS WE OFFER, OUR SALES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

MAY INCREASE THE COST OF PROTECTING THESE RIGHTS OR REDUCE OUR REVENUES.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON

MAINTENANCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE CREATE. NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION, AND ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES, THE FALLING PRICES OF DEVICES INCORPORATING SUCH

TECHNOLOGIES, AND INCREASED BROADBAND INTERNET SPEED AND PENETRATION HAVE MADE THE UNAUTHORIZED DIGITAL COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR FILMS, TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND OTHER CREATIVE WORKS EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS MORE CHALLENGING. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT UNAUTHORIZED USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY GENERALLY IS A SIGNIFICANT AND RAPIDLY GROWING PHENOMENON. THESE DEVELOPMENTS REQUIRE US TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES

TO PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED USE AND PRESENT THE RISK OF INCREASED LOSSES OF REVENUE AS A RESULT OF UNAUTHORIZED DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION OF OUR CONTENT AND SALES OF UNAUTHORIZED DVDS AND OTHER COUNTERFEIT PRODUCTS.

A VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR INCREASE

THE COST OF PROVIDING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PARTICULARLY OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS, IS

HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM. THE ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM, AS WELL AS DEMAND FOR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE UNITED STATES, GLOBALLY OR IN SPECIFIC

REGIONS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING: ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR NATURAL DISASTERS (SUCH AS EXCESSIVE HEAT OR RAIN, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES); HEALTH CONCERNS; INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL OR MILITARY

DEVELOPMENTS; AND TERRORIST ATTACKS. THESE EVENTS AND OTHERS, SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN TRAVEL AND ENERGY COSTS AND COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACKS OR OTHER WIDESPREAD COMPUTING OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, MAY ALSO DAMAGE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THESE EVENTS. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE ROYALTIES FROM THE SALES OF OUR LICENSED GOODS AND SERVICES BY THIRD PARTIES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESSES OPERATED UNDER BRANDS LICENSED

FROM THE COMPANY, AND WE ARE THEREFORE DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESSES OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES FOR THAT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE. A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS COULD INFLUENCE THE SUCCESS OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES AND IF NEGATIVE FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED A

SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF OUR LICENSEES THEY COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE OBTAIN INSURANCE AGAINST THE RISK OF LOSSES RELATING TO SOME BUT NOT ALL OF THESE EVENTS, AND WHEN INSURANCE IS OBTAINED IT IS

SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES, EXCLUSIONS AND CAPS. THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF COVERAGE WE OBTAIN VARY FROM TIME TO TIME DEPENDING ON OUR VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SPECIFIC TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS IN RELATION TO THE COST OF OBTAINING COVERAGE FOR SUCH TYPES

AND LEVELS OF LOSS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS OR OTHERWISE AFFECT THE

PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OCCUR WE MAY NEED TO ADJUST OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES TO MEET

THESE CHANGES OR WE MAY OTHERWISE FIND IT NECESSARY TO RESTRUCTURE OUR OPERATIONS OR PARTICULAR BUSINESSES OR ASSETS. IN ADDITION, EXTERNAL EVENTS INCLUDING ACCEPTANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL OFFERINGS AND CHANGES IN MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY IMPAIR

THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS. WHEN THESE CHANGES OR EVENTS OCCUR, WE MAY INCUR COSTS TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND MAY NEED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF ASSETS. WE MAY ALSO NEED TO INVEST IN NEW BUSINESSES THAT HAVE SHORT-TERM RETURNS THAT ARE

NEGATIVE OR LOW AND WHOSE ULTIMATE BUSINESS PROSPECTS ARE UNCERTAIN. IN ANY OF THESE EVENTS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE, WE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS OR RETURNS ON NEW INVESTMENTS MAY BE LOWER THAN PRIOR TO

THE CHANGE IN STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING.

RECENT TURMOIL IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND IMPEDE ACCESS TO OR INCREASE

THE COST OF FINANCING OUR OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS.

U.S. AND GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS HAVE RECENTLY UNDERGONE SIGNIFICANT

DISRUPTION, MAKING IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY BUSINESSES TO OBTAIN FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. IN ADDITION, EQUITY MARKETS ARE CONTINUING TO EXPERIENCE RAPID AND WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN VALUE. IF THESE CONDITIONS CONTINUE OR WORSEN, OUR COST OF BORROWING

MAY INCREASE AND IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES WHICH ARE BASED, IN

SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. A DECREASE IN THESE RATINGS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN

FINANCING. THE DISRUPTION IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS HAS ALSO IMPACTED SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. A SUSTAINED DECLINE IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SECURE

CREDIT-WORTHY COUNTERPARTIES FOR OUR INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING PROGRAMS AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SETTLE EXISTING CONTRACTS.

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN EACH OF

OUR BUSINESSES FROM ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER AND FROM OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO MUST COMPETE TO OBTAIN HUMAN RESOURCES, PROGRAMMING AND OTHER RESOURCES WE

REQUIRE IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS, STATIONS AND ONLINE OFFERINGS COMPETE FOR VIEWERS WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES AS WELL AS WITH HOME VIDEO

PRODUCTS AND INTERNET USAGE.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND STATIONS COMPETE FOR THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES, AS WELL AS NEWSPAPER,

MAGAZINES, BILLBOARDS AND THE INTERNET.



OUR CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR CARRIAGE OF THEIR PROGRAMMING WITH OTHER PROGRAMMING PROVIDERS.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CREATIVE TALENT AND SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING WITH OTHER BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS.



OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS COMPETE FOR GUESTS WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATION ACTIVITIES.



OUR STUDIO OPERATIONS COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT.



OUR STUDIO OPERATIONS, BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND PUBLISHING BUSINESSES COMPETE TO OBTAIN CREATIVE AND PERFORMING TALENT, STORY PROPERTIES, ADVERTISER

SUPPORT, BROADCAST RIGHTS AND MARKET SHARE.



OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT COMPETES IN THE CHARACTER MERCHANDISING AND OTHER LICENSING, PUBLISHING, INTERACTIVE AND RETAIL ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER LICENSORS,

PUBLISHERS AND RETAILERS OF CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES.

COMPETITION IN EACH OF THESE AREAS MAY DIVERT

CONSUMERS FROM OUR CREATIVE OR OTHER PRODUCTS, OR TO OTHER PRODUCTS OR OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR MARKETING COSTS. COMPETITION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF RESOURCES CAN INCREASE THE COST OF PRODUCING OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SUSTAINED INCREASES IN COSTS OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND OTHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS MAY

REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

WITH MORE THAN 150,000 EMPLOYEES, OUR PROFITABILITY IS SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED BY COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS

AND CURRENT AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. WE MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THESE COSTS AS A RESULT OF MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING INCREASES IN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN

INVESTMENT RETURNS AND DISCOUNT RATES USED TO CALCULATE PENSION EXPENSE AND RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE VOLATILE AND MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS IN SOME YEARS. AS A RESULT OF RECENT OVERALL MARKET CONDITIONS, WE HAVE

EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR PENSION AND POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ASSETS SINCE OUR JUNE 30, 2008 MEASUREMENT DATE. THESE MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS AS WELL AS THE DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF PENSION PLAN ASSETS

MAY PUT UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING PENSION AND MEDICAL BENEFITS AND MAY INCREASE FUTURE FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN

LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE COULD REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF

LONG-TERM PROGRAMMING OR CARRIAGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT RENEWED ON SUFFICIENTLY FAVORABLE TERMS.

WE ENTER INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR

BOTH THE ACQUISITION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS FOR SPORTING EVENTS AND OTHER PROGRAMS, AND CONTRACTS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PROGRAMMING TO CABLE SERVICE

PROVIDERS. AS THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRE, WE MUST RENEW OR RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RENEW THEM ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY LOSE PROGRAMMING RIGHTS OR DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS. EVEN IF THESE CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED, THE COST OF

OBTAINING PROGRAMMING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE (OR INCREASE AT FASTER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE) OR THE REVENUE FROM DISTRIBUTION OF PROGRAMS MAY BE REDUCED (OR INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE). WITH RESPECT TO THE

ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, THE IMPACT OF THESE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS ON OUR RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS,

EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT REVENUES FROM PROGRAMMING BASED ON THESE RIGHTS WILL EXCEED THE COST OF THE RIGHTS PLUS THE OTHER COSTS OF PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING THE

PROGRAMMING.

CHANGES IN REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES MAY IMPAIR THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BROADCAST NETWORKS AND TELEVISION STATIONS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED, AND EACH OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF UNITED STATES AND

OVERSEAS REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATIONS INCLUDE.



DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TAX LAWS OR CURRENCY CONTROLS.

CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE REGULATORY AREAS MAY REQUIRE US TO SPEND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS, OR MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE PROFITABLE.

LABOR DISPUTES MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN VARIOUS OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF OUR THEME PARKS

EMPLOYEES OR THE EMPLOYEES OF OUR LICENSEES OR RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUES, AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS. THE CONTRACT THE COMPANY AND OTHER PRODUCERS HAD WITH THE

SCREEN ACTORS GUILD EXPIRED JUNE 30, 2008 WITHOUT AGREEMENT ON TERMS FOR A NEW CONTRACT. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT A NEW AGREEMENT WILL BE REACHED WITHOUT A WORK STOPPAGE, AND ANY WORK STOPPAGE COULD LIMIT PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION OF

FILMS OR RESULT IN LIMITATIONS ON PRODUCTION AND AIRING OF TELEVISION PROGRAMMING, EITHER OF WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE IMPACT ON REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY.

PROVISIONS IN OUR CORPORATE DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE STATE LAW COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL, EVEN IF THAT CHANGE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO SHAREHOLDERS.

OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION CONTAINS A PROVISION REGULATING THE ABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BRING MATTERS FOR ACTION BEFORE ANNUAL AND

SPECIAL MEETINGS AND AUTHORIZES OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE AND SET THE TERMS OF PREFERRED STOCK. THE REGULATIONS ON SHAREHOLDER ACTION COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ANY PERSON SEEKING TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN SHAREHOLDER

APPROVAL OF ACTIONS THAT WOULD SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD EFFECTIVELY DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF ANY PERSON SEEKING CONTROL OR OTHERWISE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN CONTROL. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE

ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, WHICH COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE OF CONTROL IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE SEASONALITY OF CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES COULD EXACERBATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES

IS NORMALLY SUBJECT TO SEASONAL VARIATIONS, AS FOLLOWS.



REVENUES IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. IN GENERAL, ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE SOMEWHAT

HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS ARE MET, AND THESE

COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION DURING THIS PERIOD.



REVENUES IN OUR PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY RESULTING FROM THE SEASONAL NATURE OF VACATION TRAVEL

AND LOCAL ENTERTAINMENT EXCURSIONS. PEAK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY GENERALLY OCCUR DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN SCHOOL VACATIONS OCCUR AND DURING EARLY-WINTER AND SPRING-HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT, AND TELEVISION MARKETS.

RELEASE DATES ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF ANIMATED THEATRICAL RELEASES

AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS.

ACCORDINGLY, IF A SHORT TERM NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OCCURS DURING A TIME OF

HIGH SEASONAL DEMAND (SUCH AS HURRICANE DAMAGE TO OUR PARKS DURING THE SUMMER TRAVEL SEASON), THE EFFECT COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF THAT BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR.

ITEM 3.  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

MILNE AND DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. V. STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC.

ON NOVEMBER 5, 2002, CLARE MILNE, THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A. A. MILNE, AUTHOR OF

THE WINNIE THE POOH BOOKS, AND THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. (DEI) FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. (SSI) IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. ON NOVEMBER 4,

2002, MS. MILNE SERVED NOTICES TO SSI AND DEI TERMINATING A. A. MILNES PRIOR GRANT OF RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004, AND GRANTED ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS TO DEI. IN THEIR LAWSUIT, MS. MILNE AND DEI SOUGHT A

DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, UNDER UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT LAW, THAT MS. MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE VALID; THAT SSIS RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH IN THE UNITED STATES TERMINATED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004; THAT UPON TERMINATION OF

SSIS RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

LAWSUIT (THE STATE COURT ACTION) TERMINATED BY OPERATION OF LAW; AND THAT, AS OF

NOVEMBER 5, 2004, SSI WAS ENTITLED TO NO FURTHER ROYALTIES FOR USES OF WINNIE THE POOH. SSI FILED (A) AN ANSWER DENYING THE MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT AND (B) COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT

(I) MS. MILNES GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI IS VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE AND (II) DEI REMAINS OBLIGATED TO PAY SSI ROYALTIES UNDER THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT. THE DISTRICT COURT RULED THAT MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE

INVALID. THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED, AND ON JUNE 26, 2006, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DENIED MILNES PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI. ON AUGUST 1, 2003, SSI FILED AN AMENDED ANSWER AND

COUNTERCLAIMS AND A THIRD-PARTY COMPLAINT AGAINST HARRIET HUNT (HEIR TO E. H. SHEPARD, ILLUSTRATOR OF THE ORIGINAL WINNIE THE POOH STORIES), WHO HAD SERVED A NOTICE OF TERMINATION AND A GRANT OF RIGHTS SIMILAR TO MS. MILNES, AND ASSERTED

COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE MILNE AND HUNT TERMINATIONS AND THE GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI FOR (A) UNLAWFUL AND UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES; AND (B) BREACH OF THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT.

ON OCTOBER 19, 2006, THE PARTIES STIPULATED TO SSIS FILING ITS FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS (FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER) SEEKING

(A) TO INVALIDATE THE HUNT TERMINATION NOTICE, (B) TO TERMINATE THE COMPANYS RIGHTS VIS-À-VIS SSI, AND (C) DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS, AMONG OTHER RELIEF. THAT STIPULATION ALSO PROVIDED THAT HUNT AND

THE COMPANY NEED NOT RESPOND TO THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF TWO EVENTS: THE STATE COURT APPEAL IN

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

, AND THE TRIAL IN THE DISTRICT COURT ON THE VALIDITY OF THE HUNT

TERMINATION NOTICE. SSI THEN SOUGHT TO WITHDRAW BOTH THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND ITS STIPULATION, BUT ON NOVEMBER 3, 2006, THE DISTRICT COURT DENIED THAT REQUEST. SSIS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE VALIDITY OF HUNTS

2002 ATTEMPT TO RECAPTURE E. H. SHEPARDS RIGHTS WAS GRANTED ON FEBRUARY 15, 2007, AND THEREAFTER, ON MARCH 27, 2007, THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED AS MOOT ALL CLAIMS AGAINST HUNT AND THREE OF SSIS COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE

COMPANY RELATED TO THE COMPANYS AGREEMENTS WITH MILNE AND HUNT CONCERNING THE TERMINATION AND DISPOSITION OF THEIR RIGHTS. ON JANUARY 3, 2008, THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DENIED SSIS PETITION FOR REVIEW IN THE STATE COURT ACTION,

WHEREUPON ON APRIL 21, 2008, THE COMPANY MOVED FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON ALL OF SSIS CLAIMS IN THE DISTRICT COURT ACTION. ON JUNE 3, 2008, THE DISTRICT COURT ORDERED FURTHER BRIEFING ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER SSIS MISCONDUCT IN THE

STATE COURT ACTION WARRANTS DISMISSAL OF ALL OF ITS CLAIMS IN THE DISTRICT COURT, AND THEN ON JULY 29, 2008, THE DISTRICT COURT REFERRED THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION TO A SPECIAL MASTER WHO WILL ISSUE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE

PRECLUSION AND TERMINATION ISSUES RAISED BY THE MOTION.

RELATEDLY, ON DECEMBER 4, 2006, AUGUST 22, 2007, AND

FEBRUARY 8, APRIL 18, AUGUST 27, 2008, AND OCTOBER 31, 2008, SSI INITIATED PROCEEDINGS IN THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (PTO) SEEKING CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH TRADEMARK REGISTRATIONS AND

OPPOSING APPLICATIONS FOR OTHER WINNIE THE POOH TRADEMARKS. THE PTO HAS SUSPENDED ALL THE PROCEEDINGS ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE RELIEF SOUGHT IS EFFECTIVELY DUPLICATIVE OF THAT SOUGHT IN THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER. ALSO, ON APRIL 18 AND

OCTOBER 16, 2008, SSI INITIATED ACTIONS BEFORE THE CANADIAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OFFICE (CIPO) OPPOSING APPLICATIONS FOR CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH TRADEMARKS. ON SEPTEMBER 4, 2008, THE COMPANY FILED AN ANSWER TO THE

APRIL 18 ACTION BEFORE THE CIPO, DENYING SSIS CLAIMS.

THE COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES, CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS

AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR CO-DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS INVOLVING COPYRIGHT, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE COMPANY TO SUFFER ANY MATERIAL

LIABILITY BY REASON OF SUCH ACTIONS.

REVENUES FOR THE

YEAR INCREASED 7%, OR $2.3 BILLION, TO $37.8 BILLION; NET INCOME DECREASED 6%, OR $260 MILLION, TO $4.4 BILLION; AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED 1% TO $2.28.

NET INCOME FOR THE CURRENT YEAR INCLUDED CERTAIN ITEMS THAT AFFECTED COMPARABILITY, INCLUDING AN ACCOUNTING GAIN RELATED TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE DISNEY STORES IN NORTH AMERICA AND A GAIN ON THE SALE OF MOVIES.COM

(TOGETHER $0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE), THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN PRIOR-YEAR INCOME TAX MATTERS ($0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE), AND A BAD DEBT CHARGE FOR A RECEIVABLE FROM LEHMAN BROTHERS ($0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE). THESE ITEMS COLLECTIVELY RESULTED

IN A NET BENEFIT OF $0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE. FISCAL 2007 INCLUDED GAINS FROM THE SALES OF E! ENTERTAINMENT AND US WEEKLY ($0.31 PER DILUTED SHARE), FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN PRIOR-YEAR INCOME TAX MATTERS ($0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE), INCOME FROM

THE DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF THE ABC RADIO BUSINESS ($0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE) AND AN EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION PLAN MODIFICATION CHARGE ($0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE). INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ROUNDING, THESE ITEMS COLLECTIVELY RESULTED IN A NET BENEFIT

OF $0.33 PER DILUTED SHARE.

THE DECREASE IN NET INCOME FOR THE CURRENT YEAR WAS THE RESULT OF GAINS IN THE PRIOR YEAR FROM THE SALE OF E!

ENTERTAINMENT AND US WEEKLY AND A DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME AT THE STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING INCOME AT THE MEDIA NETWORKS, PARKS AND RESORTS AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENTS. THE INCREASE IN DILUTED EARNINGS

PER SHARE WAS DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING. EARNINGS GROWTH AT THE OPERATING SEGMENTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN AFFILIATE AND ADVERTISING REVENUES AT OUR CABLE BUSINESSES, HIGHER GUEST SPENDING AND ATTENDANCE

AT WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT AND DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS, AND STRONG SALES OF LICENSED PRODUCTS AT CONSUMER PRODUCTS. THE DECREASE AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN HOME ENTERTAINMENT.

2007 VS. 2006

REVENUES FOR THE YEAR INCREASED 5%,

OR $1.8 BILLION, TO $35.5 BILLION; NET INCOME INCREASED 39%, OR $1.3 BILLION, TO $4.7 BILLION; AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED 37% TO $2.25.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF THE ABC RADIO BUSINESS ($0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE), GAINS ON SALES OF A SPANISH CABLE EQUITY INVESTMENT AND DISCOVER MAGAZINE (TOGETHER $0.02 PER DILUTED SHARE), FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN PRIOR-YEAR INCOME TAX MATTERS

($0.02 PER DILUTED SHARE) AND A NET BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE PIXAR ACQUISITION ($0.01 PER DILUTED SHARE). INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ROUNDING, THESE ITEMS COLLECTIVELY BENEFITED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BY $0.09.

STRONG SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS, INCREASED GUEST SPENDING AND THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AT WALT DISNEY WORLD AND DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS AND LOWER

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES. IN THE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS DISCUSSION, EQUITY

IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES IS INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME BUT DOES NOT AFFECT SEGMENT REVENUES OR COSTS AND EXPENSES.

THE COMPANY EVALUATES THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS OPERATING SEGMENTS BASED ON SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AND MANAGEMENT USES AGGREGATE SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AS A MEASURE OF THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE OPERATING BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT INFORMATION ABOUT AGGREGATE SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME ASSISTS INVESTORS BY ALLOWING THEM TO EVALUATE CHANGES IN THE OPERATING RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF BUSINESSES SEPARATE FROM FACTORS OTHER THAN BUSINESS OPERATIONS

THAT AFFECT NET INCOME. THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECONCILES SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME TO INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS BEFORE INCOME TAXES AND MINORITY INTERESTS.% CHANGE

REVENUES

MEDIA NETWORKS REVENUES INCREASED 7%, OR $1.0 BILLION, TO $16.1 BILLION, CONSISTING OF A 10% INCREASE, OR $874 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND A 2% INCREASE, OR $138 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING.

INCREASED CABLE NETWORKS REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH OF $654 MILLION FROM CABLE SERVICE PROVIDERS, $206 MILLION FROM ADVERTISING REVENUES AND

$14 MILLION FROM OTHER REVENUES. REVENUES FROM CABLE SERVICE PROVIDERS (AFFILIATE FEES) ARE GENERALLY DERIVED FROM FEES CHARGED ON A PER-SUBSCRIBER BASIS, AND THE INCREASE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES AT ESPN AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT,

AT THE WORLDWIDE DISNEY CHANNELS AND ABC FAMILY CHANNEL. THE INCREASE AT ESPN WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES AND SUBSCRIBER GROWTH, THE INCREASE AT THE WORLDWIDE DISNEY CHANNELS WAS DRIVEN BY SUBSCRIBER GROWTH AND THE INCREASE AT

THE ABC FAMILY WAS DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES. HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUES AT ESPN AND ABC FAMILY REFLECTED IMPROVED RATES AND RATINGS. HIGHER OTHER REVENUES WERE DRIVEN BY DVD SALES, PRIMARILY

HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL

, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

THE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM WITH AN INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CONTRACTS WITH

CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS INCLUDE ANNUAL LIVE PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS. IN THESE CASES, RECOGNITION OF REVENUES SUBJECT TO THE COMMITMENTS IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE ANNUAL COMMITMENTS ARE SATISFIED, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE

RECOGNITION IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

INCREASED BROADCASTING REVENUES REFLECTED HIGHER INTERNATIONAL SALES OF ABC STUDIOS

PRODUCTIONS AND INCREASED REVENUES AT THE INTERNET GROUP, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED ADVERTISING REVENUES, LARGELY AT THE OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS. INCREASED INTERNATIONAL SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS WERE DRIVEN BY

GREYS ANATOMY,

PRIVATE PRACTICE

AND

REAPER

. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES AT THE INTERNET GROUP REFLECTED SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE AT CLUB PENGUIN, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. REVENUES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK WERE COMPARABLE

TO THE PRIOR YEAR AS THE IMPACT OF LOWER RATINGS WAS OFFSET BY HIGHER ADVERTISING RATES AND DIGITAL MEDIA REVENUES.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS COSTS, PRODUCTION COSTS, PARTICIPATION COSTS, DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING EXPENSES AND

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, INCREASED 6%, OR $641 MILLION, TO $12 BILLION, CONSISTING OF AN 8% INCREASE, OR $463 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND A 3% INCREASE, OR $178 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS WAS PRIMARILY

DUE TO INCREASED COSTS AT ESPN AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE WORLDWIDE DISNEY CHANNELS, DRIVEN BY HIGHER PROGRAMMING, ADMINISTRATIVE AND MARKETING COSTS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL PROGRAMMING COSTS

AT ABC FAMILY. THE INCREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DUE TO HIGHER PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL SALES OF OUR PROGRAMS AND HIGHER COSTS AT THE INTERNET GROUP RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL MOBILE AND ONLINE OPERATIONS, DISNEY ONLINE AND

CLUB PENGUIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF COSTS RELATED TO THE DISNEY-BRANDED MOBILE PHONE SERVICE, WHICH WAS SHUT DOWN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE CURRENT YEAR.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF RIGHTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE, NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION, NATIONAL

ASSOCIATION OF STOCK CAR AUTO RACING (NASCAR), MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL AND VARIOUS COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL CONFERENCES AND FOOTBALL BOWL GAMES. THE COSTS OF THESE CONTRACTS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. WE ENTER INTO THESE

CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT, OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACTS, REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING DURING THE PROGRAMMING AND AFFILIATE FEES WILL EXCEED THE COSTS OF THE PROGRAMMING. WHILE CONTRACT COSTS MAY INITIALLY EXCEED INCREMENTAL

REVENUES AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT OPERATING INCOME, IT IS OUR EXPECTATION THAT THE COMBINED VALUE TO OUR NETWORKS FROM ALL OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL RESULT IN LONG-TERM BENEFITS. THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THESE CONTRACTS ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OVER THE

TERM OF THE CONTRACTS IS DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 11%, OR $480 MILLION, TO $4.8 BILLION

FOR THE YEAR DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $523 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $43 MILLION AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT THE CABLE NETWORKS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH AT ESPN, HIGHER INCOME AT OUR CABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, AND INCREASES AT ABC FAMILY AND THE DOMESTIC DISNEY CHANNELS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM WITH AN INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER ADVERTISING

REVENUES AT THE OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN IMPROVEMENT AT THE INTERNET GROUP. THE IMPROVEMENT AT THE INTERNET GROUP WAS DRIVEN BY THE ABSENCE OF COSTS RELATED TO THE DISNEY-BRANDED MOBILE PHONE SERVICE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER COSTS FOR INTERNATIONAL MOBILE AND ONLINE OPERATIONS AND DISNEY ONLINE. THE INCREASE IN INCOME AT OUR CABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AFFILIATE AND ADVERTISING REVENUE AT LIFETIME AND A GAIN ON THE SALE OF A EUROPEAN

CABLE CHANNEL.

ABC RADIO TRANSACTION

ON JUNE 12, 2007, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE SPIN-OFF OF ITS WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, ABC RADIO HOLDINGS, INC., WHICH WAS THEN MERGED INTO A SUBSIDIARY OF CITADEL BROADCASTING CORPORATION (CITADEL). PRIOR TO THE SPIN-OFF, THE COMPANY

CONSOLIDATED ITS ABC RADIO BUSINESS, CONSISTING OF 22 LARGE-MARKET RADIO STATIONS AND THE ABC RADIO NETWORK BUSINESSES, UNDER ABC RADIO HOLDINGS, INC. THE TRANSACTION DID NOT INCLUDE THE COMPANYS ESPN RADIO OR RADIO DISNEY NETWORK AND STATION

BUSINESSES. THE RESULTS OF THE ABC RADIO BUSINESS HAVE BEEN REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. THE COMPANY NOW INCLUDES THE ESPN RADIO AND RADIO DISNEY NETWORK AND STATIONS BUSINESSES WITH CABLE NETWORKS IN THE MEDIA

NETWORKS SEGMENT. PRIOR TO THE TRANSACTION, THE COMPANYS RADIO BUSINESSES WERE INCLUDED WITH BROADCASTING IN THE MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT. PREVIOUSLY REPORTED RESULTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO REFLECT THIS PRESENTATION.

DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS

AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS, REVENUE GROWTH WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT AND DISNEY VACATION CLUB. REVENUE GROWTH

AT WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED GUEST SPENDING AND THEME PARK ATTENDANCE. INCREASED GUEST SPENDING WAS DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE TICKET PRICES, INCREASED FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES AND HIGHER AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATES. AT

DISNEY VACATION CLUB, REVENUE GROWTH REFLECTED HIGHER VACATION CLUB OWNERSHIP SALES, INCLUDING EXTENSIONS OF THE TERM OF OWNERSHIP ON EXISTING VACATION HOME PROPERTIES.

INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS

AT OUR INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS, REVENUE GROWTH RESULTED FROM AN INCREASE AT DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS DUE TO THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO, AND INCREASED GUEST SPENDING AND THEME PARK ATTENDANCE. INCREASED GUEST SPENDING WAS DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATES AND AVERAGE TICKET PRICES.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND

EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF LABOR, DEPRECIATION, COSTS OF MERCHANDISE, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SOLD, MARKETING AND SALES EXPENSE, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE AND ENTERTAINMENT, INCREASED 8%, OR $691 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN COSTS AND EXPENSES WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES AT DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS, WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT AND DISNEY VACATION CLUB. THE INCREASE AT DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS WAS DUE TO THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE

U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO, LABOR COST INFLATION AND HIGHER VOLUME-RELATED COSTS. THE INCREASE AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT WAS DUE TO LABOR AND OTHER COST INFLATION, NEW GUEST OFFERINGS AND VOLUME-RELATED COSTS. THE INCREASE AT DISNEY VACATION

CLUB WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER OWNERSHIP SALES.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 11%, OR $187 MILLION, TO $1.9 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES AT DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS AND THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT.

TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION, $112 MILLION IN DOMESTIC THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION, AND $66 MILLION IN DOMESTIC HOME ENTERTAINMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $147 MILLION IN INTERNATIONAL HOME ENTERTAINMENT.

THE DECREASE IN WORLDWIDE TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION REVENUES WAS DRIVEN BY THE ABSENCE OF THE MULTI-SEASON SALE OF

HOME IMPROVEMENT

WHICH OCCURRED

IN THE PRIOR YEAR. LOWER REVENUES IN DOMESTIC THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION REFLECTED THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF PRIOR-YEAR TITLES, INCLUDING

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: AT WORLDS END, RATATOUILLE,

AND

WILD HOGS,

COMPARED TO THE CURRENT

YEAR TITLES, WHICH INCLUDED

NATIONAL TREASURE 2: BOOK OF SECRETS

AND

AND

RATATOUILLE

IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MANS CHEST

PRIMARILY OF PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION, DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING EXPENSES, PRODUCTION COSTS AND PARTICIPATION COSTS, WERE COMPARABLE TO THE PRIOR YEAR AS DECREASES IN WORLDWIDE TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION AND DOMESTIC THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION WERE

LARGELY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL HOME ENTERTAINMENT.

LOWER COSTS AND EXPENSES IN WORLDWIDE TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION WERE

PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN AMORTIZATION AND PARTICIPATION COSTS DRIVEN BY THE ABSENCE OF THE

HOME IMPROVEMENT

SALE. THE DECREASE IN DOMESTIC THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AMORTIZATION EXPENSE REFLECTING DECREASED

REVENUES FOR CURRENT YEAR RELEASES AND LOWER FILM COST WRITE-DOWNS. THE INCREASE IN INTERNATIONAL HOME ENTERTAINMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER DISTRIBUTION COSTS DRIVEN BY EXTENSIVE MARKETING CAMPAIGNS TO LAUNCH CURRENT YEAR TITLES.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

THE INCREASE AT THE DISNEY STORES WAS DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF THE DISNEY STORES NORTH AMERICA DURING THE THIRD QUARTER (SEE DISCUSSION OF THE DISNEY STORES ACQUISITION BELOW). THE REVENUE GROWTH AT MERCHANDISE

LICENSING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EARNED ROYALTIES ACROSS MULTIPLE PRODUCT CATEGORIES, LED BY

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN COSTS AFFECT RESULTS IN ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS, WITH APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THESE COSTS BEING BORNE BY

THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSES OF $255 MILLION, $278 MILLION AND $462 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2008, 2007, AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN FISCAL 2008 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE IMPROVED FUNDED STATUS OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLANS AS OF THE JUNE 30, 2007 MEASUREMENT DATE DRIVEN BY COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR THE JUNE 30, 2007 VALUATION WAS

COMPARABLE TO THE JUNE 30, 2006 VALUATION DATE. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD

CURVES CONSTRUCTED FROM A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

WE EXPECT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS TO DECREASE TO APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION TO $245 MILLION IN FISCAL 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE

IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS. DURING FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY WAS NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLANS UNDER FUNDING REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006

(PPA) AND CONTRIBUTED $29 MILLION TO PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS NOT SUBJECT TO PPA. THE COMPANY EXPECTS PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS IN FISCAL 2009 TO RANGE FROM $200 MILLION TO $300 MILLION. FINAL FUNDING

REQUIREMENTS FOR FISCAL 2009 WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON OUR JANUARY 1, 2009 FUNDING ACTUARIAL VALUATION. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO MAKE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS. SEE ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS FOR THE

IMPACT OF FACTORS AFFECTING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS.

MEDIA NETWORKS

REVENUES

MEDIA NETWORKS REVENUES INCREASED 6%, OR $918 MILLION, TO $15.1 BILLION, CONSISTING OF A 12% INCREASE, OR $1.0 BILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND A 1%

DECREASE, OR $90 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING.

INCREASED CABLE NETWORKS REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH OF $601 MILLION FROM CABLE

SERVICE PROVIDERS, $240 MILLION FROM ADVERTISING REVENUES AND $167 MILLION FROM OTHER REVENUES. REVENUES FROM CABLE SERVICE PROVIDERS ARE GENERALLY DERIVED FROM FEES CHARGED ON A PER-SUBSCRIBER BASIS, AND THE INCREASE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS DRIVEN

BY CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES AND SUBSCRIBER GROWTH PRIMARILY AT ESPN AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, AT THE WORLDWIDE DISNEY CHANNELS AND AT ABC FAMILY. HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUES REFLECTED THE ADDITION OF NASCAR PROGRAMMING AT ESPN AND AN INCREASE AT

ABC FAMILY PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RATES. HIGHER OTHER REVENUES WERE DRIVEN BY DVD SALES, PRIMARILY

HIGH SCHOOL MUSICAL

, AND A FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT OF A CLAIM WITH AN INTERNATIONAL DISTRIBUTOR.

DECREASED BROADCASTING REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SALES OF

ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS. THE DECREASE IN ADVERTISING REVENUE AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO FEWER HOURS OF SPORTS PROGRAMMING REFLECTING THE ABSENCE OF MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL, THE SUPER BOWL AND THREE COLLEGE BOWL GAMES, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN PRIMETIME. IN PRIMETIME, HIGHER ADVERTISING RATES AND SOLD INVENTORY WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RATINGS. INCREASED SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS REFLECTED HIGHER INTERNATIONAL AND DVD SALES OF THE HIT DRAMAS

DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES

,

GREYS ANATOMY,

AND

UGLY BETTY.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES INCREASED 1%, OR $164 MILLION, TO $11.3 BILLION, CONSISTING OF AN 8% INCREASE, OR $463 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY A 5% DECREASE, OR $299 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COSTS AT ESPN PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS FOR THE

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADDITION OF NASCAR AND FOR MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL COMPARED TO SUNDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND HIGHER PROGRAMMING MARKETING AND ADMINISTRATIVE

COSTS AT THE WORLDWIDE DISNEY CHANNELS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COSTS DUE TO THE TRANSITION OF ESPNS MOBILE PHONE OPERATIONS TO A LICENSING MODEL. THE DECREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DUE TO LOWER SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COSTS OF DISNEY-BRANDED MOBILE PHONE SERVICE, INCLUDING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS SHUTDOWN, AS WELL AS HIGHER PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

INCREASED 23%, OR $794 MILLION, TO $4.3 BILLION FOR THE YEAR DUE TO INCREASES OF $576 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND $218 MILLION AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT THE CABLE NETWORKS WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO GROWTH AT ESPN, THE INTERNATIONAL

DISNEY CHANNELS AND AT ABC FAMILY. THE INCREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DUE TO STRONG SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS, FEWER HOURS OF SPORTS PROGRAMMING AND HIGHER PRIMETIME ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DISNEY MOBILE PHONE SERVICE. SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES INCOME FROM EQUITY INVESTEES OF $484 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2007, COMPARED TO $444 MILLION IN FISCAL 2006.

PARKS AND RESORTS

REVENUES

REVENUES AT PARKS AND RESORTS INCREASED 7%, OR $701 MILLION, TO $10.6 BILLION DUE TO INCREASES OF $483 MILLION AT OUR DOMESTIC RESORTS AND $218 MILLION AT

OUR INTERNATIONAL RESORTS.

DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS

AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS, REVENUE GROWTH WAS DUE TO INCREASES AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT, DISNEY VACATION CLUB AND DISNEYLAND RESORT. AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT, REVENUE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED GUEST SPENDING AND

THEME PARK ATTENDANCE. HIGHER GUEST SPENDING AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT REFLECTED INCREASED FOOD, BEVERAGE AND MERCHANDISE SPENDING, HIGHER AVERAGE TICKET PRICES AND A HIGHER AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATE. REVENUE GROWTH AT DISNEY VACATION CLUB

WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER VACATION CLUB OWNERSHIP SALES. AT DISNEYLAND RESORT, REVENUE GROWTH WAS DUE TO INCREASED GUEST SPENDING, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE TICKET PRICES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS

AT OUR INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS, REVENUE GROWTH WAS DUE TO AN INCREASE AT DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT REFLECTING LOWER THEME PARK ATTENDANCE. AT

DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS, REVENUE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO, AND HIGHER THEME PARK ATTENDANCE, GUEST SPENDING, AND HOTEL OCCUPANCY.

INCREASED GUEST SPENDING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A HIGHER AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATE.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES INCREASED 6%, OR $524 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN COSTS AND EXPENSES WAS DUE TO INCREASES AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT AND DISNEYLAND

RESORT PARIS. THE INCREASE AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO VOLUME-RELATED COSTS, LABOR COST INFLATION, AND NEW GUEST OFFERINGS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE. THE INCREASE AT DISNEYLAND

RESORT PARIS REFLECTED THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO, HIGHER VOLUME-RELATED COSTS, AND LABOR COST INFLATION.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

INCREASED 11%, OR $176 MILLION, TO $1.7 BILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO STRENGTH AT BOTH DOMESTIC RESORTS AND DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT.

EXPANSION, NEW RIDES AND ATTRACTIONS, CRUISE SHIPS, RECURRING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. THE DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT PARKS AND RESORTS REFLECTED LOWER EXPENDITURES AT DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS AS A RESULT OF COMPLETION OF PROJECTS

RELATED TO A MULTI-YEAR INVESTMENT PROGRAM ESTABLISHED WITH THE 2005 FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING, WHICH IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS HAD SPENT $333

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNDER THESE BANK FACILITIES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO ISSUE UP TO $800 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE FACILITY EXPIRING IN 2011, WHICH IF

UTILIZED, REDUCES AVAILABLE BORROWING UNDER THIS FACILITY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, $368 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT HAD BEEN ISSUED, OF WHICH $240 MILLION WAS ISSUED UNDER THIS FACILITY.

THE COMPANY MAY USE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS UP TO THE AMOUNT OF ITS ABOVE UNUSED BANK FACILITIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH TERM DEBT ISSUANCE AND

OPERATING CASH FLOW, TO RETIRE OR REFINANCE OTHER BORROWINGS BEFORE OR AS THEY COME DUE.

AS OF THE FILING DATE OF THIS REPORT, THE BOARD

OF DIRECTORS HAD NOT YET DECLARED A DIVIDEND RELATED TO FISCAL 2008. THE COMPANY PAID A $664 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.35 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008 RELATED TO FISCAL 2007. THE COMPANY PAID A $637 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.31 PER

SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007 RELATED TO FISCAL 2006; AND PAID A $519 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.27 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006 RELATED TO FISCAL 2005.

DURING FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 139 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $4.5 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2007, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED

202 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $6.9 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 243 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $6.9 BILLION. ON MAY 1, 2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY INCREASED THE

SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO A TOTAL OF 400 MILLION SHARES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD REMAINING AUTHORIZATION IN PLACE TO REPURCHASE 184 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE AN

EXPIRATION DATE.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH BALANCES, OTHER LIQUID ASSETS,

OPERATING CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING BUSINESSES

AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAN BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL. SEE ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS. IN ADDITION TO

MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE COMPANYS BORROWING COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CERTAIN

CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A2 AND P-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK; AND

STANDARD & POORS LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A AND A-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK. THE COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT, RELATING TO INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE

COMPANY MET ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. THE COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES ALSO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE CERTAIN ENTITIES, SUCH AS EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND, FROM ANY REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS BORROWINGS INCLUDE A COMMERCIAL TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH HAD A MATURITY DATE OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2008. SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF FISCAL 2008, ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2008, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT WITH HONG KONG DISNEYLAND PURSUANT TO WHICH HONG KONG DISNEYLAND BORROWED HK$2.3

BILLION (APPROXIMATELY $292 MILLION) UNDER A TERM LOAN AND HK$700 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION) UNDER A HK$1.0 BILLION ($129 MILLION) REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THESE FUNDS WERE USED TO REPAY HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS COMMERCIAL TERM LOAN

AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. BOTH THE TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY HAVE AN EFFECTIVE MATURITY DATE OF SEPTEMBER 2013.

TO

SUPPORT HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS NEAR-TERM OPERATING NEEDS, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO WAIVE MANAGEMENT FEES FOR FISCAL 2008 AND FISCAL 2009 AND DEFER ROYALTIES FOR THOSE YEARS, WITH PAYMENT OF THE DEFERRED ROYALTIES DEPENDENT UPON THE FUTURE

OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF HONG KONG DISNEYLAND. THE COMPANY MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT TO MEET HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS LONGER-TERM FINANCIAL AND DEVELOPMENT NEEDS.

EURO DISNEY HAS COVENANTS UNDER ITS DEBT AGREEMENTS THAT LIMIT ITS INVESTMENT AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES AND REQUIRE IT TO MEET CERTAIN ANNUAL FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE COVENANTS. SUBJECT TO FINAL THIRD-PARTY REVIEW AS PROVIDED IN ITS DEBT AGREEMENTS, EURO DISNEY BELIEVES THAT IT HAS COMPLIED WITH ITS FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COVENANTS FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT. FOR

A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND COSTS

WE EXPENSE FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND PARTICIPATION COSTS OVER THE

APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO THE ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FOR EACH PRODUCTION. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES DECREASES, AMORTIZATION OF

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED. CONVERSELY, IF ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES INCREASE, FILM AND TELEVISION COST AMORTIZATION MAY BE SLOWED. FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES THAT WILL BE EARNED

WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION SERIES, WE INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY OF

THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER.

WITH RESPECT TO FILMS INTENDED FOR THEATRICAL RELEASE, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE

OF ULTIMATE REVENUES (AND THEREFORE AFFECTING FUTURE FILM COST AMORTIZATION AND/OR IMPAIRMENT) IS DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. REVENUES DERIVED FROM OTHER MARKETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE DOMESTIC THEATRICAL RELEASE (E.G. THE HOME VIDEO OR

INTERNATIONAL THEATRICAL MARKETS) HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE VARIES PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND DEMAND FOR A PARTICULAR FILM, THE QUALITY OF

COMPETING FILMS AT THE TIME OF RELEASE, AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF MARKETING EFFORT. UPON A FILMS RELEASE AND DETERMINATION OF DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF REVENUES FROM SUCCEEDING WINDOWS AND MARKETS ARE

REVISED BASED ON HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND AN ANALYSIS OF CURRENT MARKET TRENDS. THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR RELEASED FILMS IS THE EXTENT OF HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES ACHIEVED. HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES

VARY BASED ON THE VOLUME AND QUALITY OF COMPETING HOME VIDEO PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE MANNER IN WHICH RETAILERS MARKET AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO TELEVISION SERIES OR OTHER TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS INTENDED FOR BROADCAST, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES IS THE PROGRAMS RATING. PROGRAM RATINGS, WHICH ARE AN INDICATION OF MARKET

ACCEPTANCE, DIRECTLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE ADVERTISING REVENUES DURING THE AIRING OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, TELEVISION SERIES WITH GREATER MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUES THROUGH THE

EVENTUAL SALE OF THE PROGRAM RIGHTS IN THE SYNDICATION, INTERNATIONAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKETS. ALTERNATIVELY, POOR RATINGS MAY RESULT IN A TELEVISION SERIES CANCELLATION, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE IMMEDIATE WRITE-OFF OF ANY UNAMORTIZED

PRODUCTION COSTS.

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF

TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. AMORTIZATION OF THOSE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ASSETS BEING AMORTIZED ON A NUMBER OF AIRINGS BASIS MAY BE ACCELERATED IF WE REDUCE THE

ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS AND SLOWED IF WE INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS. THE NUMBER OF FUTURE AIRINGS OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY THE PROGRAMS RATINGS IN PREVIOUS AIRINGS, EXPECTED ADVERTISING RATES AND

AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMMING. ACCORDINGLY, PLANNED USAGE IS REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND REVISED IF NECESSARY. RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT

PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO ULTIMATE REVENUES (THE PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD) OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD, AS APPROPRIATE. GROSS REVENUES INCLUDE BOTH ADVERTISING REVENUES AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE FEES. IF THE

ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON OVER THE TERM OF A MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENT APPROXIMATE EACH SEASONS RIGHTS COST BASED ON THE PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED ANNUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE

APPLICABLE SEASON. IF ULTIMATE REVENUES CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PROJECTIONS, AMORTIZATION OF THE RIGHTS COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED OR SLOWED.

COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS WHICH COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WITH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS

ARE REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE: EARLY MORNING, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME,

NEWS, CHILDREN, AND SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN-OFF

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM. ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL

DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR PROJECTIONS, FILM, TELEVISION AND PROGRAMMING COST WRITE-DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED.

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ITS VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES

OF EACH BUSINESS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THESE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES.

WE RECORD

REDUCTIONS TO HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND SOFTWARE PRODUCT REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED FUTURE RETURNS OF MERCHANDISE AND FOR CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND SALES INCENTIVES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL RETURN EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND

PROJECTIONS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD, WE MAY RECORD LESS REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS EXCEED THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT. CONVERSELY, IF

WE OVERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS FOR A PERIOD, WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS ARE LESS THAN ESTIMATED.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. FOR NON-EXPIRING, MULTI-DAY TICKETS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER A THREE-YEAR TIME PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE PATTERNS, WHICH

ARE DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS. A CHANGE IN THESE ESTIMATED USAGE PATTERNS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

THE COMPANYS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE CALCULATED USING A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY MEASUREMENT. WE EVALUATE

THESE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ANNUALLY. OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE AND EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS RETIREMENT PATTERNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER AND RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS FOR BENEFITS AS A PRESENT VALUE ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE GUIDELINE FOR SETTING

THIS RATE IS A HIGH-QUALITY LONG-TERM CORPORATE BOND RATE. A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE INCREASES THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES PENSION EXPENSE. WE INCREASED OUR DISCOUNT RATE TO 7.00% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2008 FROM 6.35% AT THE

END OF FISCAL 2007 TO REFLECT MARKET INTEREST RATE CONDITIONS AT OUR JUNE 30, 2008 MEASUREMENT DATE. THIS INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WILL AFFECT NET PERIODIC PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE IN FISCAL 2009. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT

RATE REFLECTS MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS.

THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE TOTAL NET PERIODIC PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE FOR FISCAL

2009 BY $120 MILLION AND WOULD INCREASE THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 BY $968 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE THESE AMOUNTS BY $74 MILLION AND $834

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET

ALLOCATION, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON EACH PLAN ASSET CLASS. A LOWER EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE. OUR LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.50% IN BOTH 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN THE LONG-TERM RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSET ASSUMPTION WOULD IMPACT FISCAL 2009 ANNUAL PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $53 MILLION.

SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS

SFAS

NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(SFAS 142) REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IN ASSESSING THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL AND OTHER

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MARKET VALUES AND PROJECTIONS REGARDING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND OTHER FACTORS ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE ASSETS. IF THESE ESTIMATES OR RELATED PROJECTIONS CHANGE IN THE FUTURE,

WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR THESE ASSETS.

46

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS REQUIRED BY SFAS 142, GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ONE

REPORTING LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A

REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES

WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. A KEY FACTOR FOR OUR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES IS THE ESTIMATE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WHICH IS, IN TURN, SENSITIVE TO OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARGINS FOR THESE

BUSINESSES. IF ACTUAL REVENUE GROWTH AND/OR MARGINS ARE LOWER THAN OUR EXPECTATIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER. A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE WAS NOT USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, A BUSINESS WITHIN THE

TELEVISION BROADCASTING REPORTING UNIT WITHIN THE MEDIA NETWORKS OPERATING SEGMENT. TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, WE USED A REVENUE MULTIPLE, AS A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE MAY NOT CONSISTENTLY CAPTURE THE FULL FAIR VALUE

OF THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND THERE IS LITTLE COMPARABLE MARKET DATA AVAILABLE DUE TO THE SCARCITY OF TELEVISION NETWORKS. IF THERE WAS A PUBLICLY DISCLOSED SALE OF A COMPARABLE NETWORK, THIS MAY PROVIDE BETTER MARKET INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO

ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND COULD IMPACT OUR IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT. WE APPLIED WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS

OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR

VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY HAS COST AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE

FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT FOR THESE INVESTMENTS, WE CONSIDER THESE

FACTORS AS WELL AS FORECASTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTEES. IF THESE FORECASTS ARE NOT MET, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.

WE COMPLETED OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, WHICH RESULTED IN A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $39 MILLION RELATED TO ESPN RADIO AND RADIO DISNEY FCC LICENSES. DURING FISCAL YEARS 2007 AND 2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED

NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $26 MILLION AND $32 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO ESPN RADIO AND RADIO DISNEY FCC LICENSES. THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REFLECTED OVERALL MARKET DECLINES IN CERTAIN RADIO MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

WE ARE CURRENTLY

INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LOSSES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS. THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND ARE BASED UPON AN

ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR

ASSUMPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE PROCEEDINGS. SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.

INCOME TAX AUDITS

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY

IS REGULARLY AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. OUR DETERMINATIONS REGARDING THE RECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX BENEFITS ARE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE

TAX AND LEGAL COUNSEL WHERE APPROPRIATE AND ARE BASED UPON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF OUR TAX POSITIONS IN CONSIDERATION OF APPLICABLE TAX STATUTES AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND PRECEDENTS AND UPON THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF PROCEEDINGS (OR

NEGOTIATIONS) WITH TAXING AND LEGAL AUTHORITIES. THE TAX BENEFITS ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY THE COMPANY MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS DECISION TO SETTLE RATHER

THAN LITIGATE A MATTER, RELEVANT LEGAL PRECEDENT RELATED TO SIMILAR MATTERS AND THE COMPANYS SUCCESS IN SUPPORTING ITS FILING POSITIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY ADOPTED FIN 48 AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2008. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION.

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STOCK OPTION COMPENSATION EXPENSE

EACH YEAR DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY AWARDS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO A BROAD-BASED GROUP OF MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL (THE ANNUAL GRANT). THE COMPANY USES A BINOMIAL VALUATION

MODEL WHICH TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS VOLATILITY, DIVIDEND YIELD, AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE (THE MULTIPLE OF EXERCISE PRICE TO GRANT PRICE AT WHICH

EXERCISES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON AVERAGE) AND THE TERMINATION RATE (THE PROBABILITY OF A VESTED OPTION BEING CANCELLED DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE OPTION HOLDER) IN COMPUTING THE VALUE OF THE OPTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE

BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL SHOULD PRODUCE A FAIR VALUE THAT IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VALUE OF AN EMPLOYEE OPTION.

IN FISCAL YEARS 2008,

2007, AND 2006, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OPTIONS-PRICING MODELS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS NOT ADJUSTED AFTER THE GRANT DATE, CHANGES IN

THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE THE VALUE OF, AND THEREFORE THE EXPENSE RELATED TO, FUTURE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE GREATEST VARIATION IN FAIR VALUE IN THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ARE THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND

EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN EITHER THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE WILL CAUSE THE BINOMIAL OPTION VALUE TO INCREASE OR DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION CONSIDERS BOTH HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS CHANGES IN

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION. IF THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF 29% USED BY THE COMPANY DURING 2008 WAS INCREASED OR DECREASED BY FIVE PERCENTAGE POINTS (I.E. TO 34%

OR TO 24%), THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF OUR 2008 STOCK OPTION GRANTS WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY 10% OR DECREASED BY 11%, RESPECTIVELY.

THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE MAY BE INFLUENCED BY THE COMPANYS FUTURE STOCK PERFORMANCE, STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY, AND EMPLOYEE TURNOVER RATES. IF THE EXERCISE MULTIPLE ASSUMPTION OF 1.39 USED BY THE COMPANY

DURING 2008 WERE INCREASED TO 1.6 OR DECREASED TO 1.2, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE BINOMIAL VALUE OF OUR 2008 STOCK OPTION GRANTS WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY 6% OR DECREASED BY 10%, RESPECTIVELY.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF PIXAR ON MAY 5, 2006, THE COMPANY CONVERTED PREVIOUSLY ISSUED VESTED AND UNVESTED PIXAR STOCK-BASED AWARDS

INTO DISNEY STOCK-BASED AWARDS CONSISTING OF 44 MILLION STOCK OPTIONS AND ONE MILLION RSUS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE AWARDS WAS ESTIMATED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL, AS THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO USE THE BINOMIAL VALUATION

MODEL WAS NOT REASONABLY AVAILABLE. THE METHODOLOGY UTILIZED TO DETERMINE THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL WAS CONSISTENT WITH THAT USED BY THE COMPANY FOR ITS OPTION PRICING MODELS.

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SAB 108

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE SEC STAFF ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108,

CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(SAB 108).

SAB 108 WAS ISSUED IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE SURROUNDING HOW PUBLIC COMPANIES QUANTIFY FINANCIAL STATEMENT MISSTATEMENTS. SAB 108 REQUIRES THAT REGISTRANTS QUANTIFY ERRORS USING BOTH A BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME STATEMENT

APPROACH AND EVALUATE WHETHER EITHER APPROACH RESULTS IN A MISSTATED AMOUNT THAT, WHEN ALL RELEVANT QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED, IS MATERIAL. THE COMPANY ADOPTED SAB 108 AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007, AND THE ADOPTION DID NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FIN 48

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

(FIN 48). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING

FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING A MINIMUM PROBABILITY THRESHOLD THAT A TAX POSITION MUST MEET BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED IN FIN 48 AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE

SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF

BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY ADOPTED FIN 48 AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. APPLYING FIN 48 TO ALL TAX POSITIONS UPON ADOPTION RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS OF $148 MILLION

AND $15 MILLION TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS AND MINORITY INTERESTS, RESPECTIVELY.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. WE MAY

FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE WRITTEN OR ORAL STATEMENTS THAT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING, INCLUDING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND IN REPORTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. SUCH STATEMENTS

MAY, FOR EXAMPLE, EXPRESS EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE ACTIONS THAT WE MAY TAKE, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING OR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, OR ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL INCLUDING CHANGES IN DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THESE STATEMENTS ARE MADE ON THE BASIS OF MANAGEMENTS VIEWS AND ASSUMPTIONS AS OF THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE THESE STATEMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WILL

NECESSARILY COME TO PASS. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING THESE EXPECTATIONS ARE SET FORTH UNDER ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

ITEM 7A.  QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY

IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THE

COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, AND THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER

OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A

PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS

TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW IN ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE

U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS, AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES. THE COMPANY

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UTILIZES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED, TRANSACTIONS.

THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE PRINCIPAL FOREIGN CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT

FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES GENERALLY FOR PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED

FIVE YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES.

OUR

OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS ARE TO USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES. THE AMOUNTS HEDGED USING COMMODITY SWAP CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON

FORECASTED LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES, SUCH AS FUEL OIL AND GASOLINE.

IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ENTER INTO

FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY OTHER HEDGING

TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

VALUE AT RISK (VAR)

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VAR MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES WERE

MADE ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED IN A VAR COMPUTATION. THE COMPANYS COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS INTEREST RATES,

CURRENCIES, AND EQUITY PRICES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS WERE DETERMINED BY OBSERVING INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY, AND EQUITY MARKET CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING QUARTER FOR THE CALCULATION OF VAR AMOUNTS AT

FISCAL YEAR END. THE MODEL INCLUDES ALL OF THE COMPANYS DEBT AS WELL AS ALL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND RECEIVABLES AND

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH CERTAIN OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WILL BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS.

VAR ON A COMBINED BASIS INCREASED TO $79 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 FROM $33 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2007. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE

TO HIGHER VOLATILITY OF INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES AND REDUCED CORRELATION BENEFITS ACROSS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE

ESTIMATED MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE, CALCULATED USING THE VAR MODEL, IS AS FOLLOWS (UNAUDITED, IN MILLIONS).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN

EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE

TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES,

AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY

BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON OUR EVALUATION UNDER THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED

FRAMEWORK,

MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008.

THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

IN

OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO

EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT

BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND

SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING

THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE

CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES AND ITS METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS DURING THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AFTER ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS. IN DECEMBER 1999, DVD FINANCING, INC. (DFI), A SUBSIDIARY

OF DISNEY VACATION DEVELOPMENT, INC. AND AN INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, COMPLETED A RECEIVABLE SALE TRANSACTION THAT ESTABLISHED A FACILITY THAT PERMITS DFI TO SELL RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE SALE OF VACATION CLUB MEMBERSHIPS ON A PERIODIC

BASIS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS FACILITY, DFI PREPARES SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH ITS SEPARATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE ALSO CONSOLIDATED IN THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE ABILITY TO ADD NEW RECEIVABLES TO THIS FACILITY ENDS ON

DECEMBER 4, 2008 AND, AS A RESULT OF MARKET CONDITIONS, WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO RENEW THE FACILITY ON TERMS ACCEPTABLE TO THE COMPANY.

ACCOUNTING

CHANGES

SFAS 161

IN MARCH 2008,

THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 161,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES  AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 133

(SFAS 161). SFAS 161 AMENDS AND EXPANDS THE

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES BY REQUIRING ENHANCED DISCLOSURES ABOUT HOW AND WHY THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, HOW DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED HEDGED ITEMS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR, AND HOW

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED HEDGED ITEMS AFFECT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND CASH FLOWS. SFAS 161 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2009.

EITF 07-1

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED EMERGING

ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 07-1,

ACCOUNTING FOR COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS

(EITF 07-1). EITF 07-1 DEFINES COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS AND ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING REQUIREMENTS FOR TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN PARTICIPANTS IN THE

ARRANGEMENT AND THIRD PARTIES. A COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT

70

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IS A CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT THAT INVOLVES A JOINT OPERATING ACTIVITY, FOR EXAMPLE AN AGREEMENT TO CO-PRODUCE AND DISTRIBUTE A MOTION PICTURE WITH ANOTHER

STUDIO. EITF 07-1 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2010 FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF EITF 07-1 ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SFAS 141R

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

NO. 141R,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

(SFAS 141R), WHICH REPLACES SFAS 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

. SFAS 141R ESTABLISHES PRINCIPLES AND REQUIREMENTS FOR DETERMINING HOW AN ENTERPRISE RECOGNIZES AND MEASURES THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION, INCLUDING NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION, AND CERTAIN ACQUIRED CONTINGENCIES. SFAS 141R ALSO REQUIRES ACQUISITION-RELATED TRANSACTION EXPENSES AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS BE

EXPENSED AS INCURRED RATHER THAN CAPITALIZED AS A COMPONENT OF THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. SFAS 141R WILL BE APPLICABLE PROSPECTIVELY TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS BEGINNING IN THE COMPANYS 2010 FISCAL YEAR.

SFAS 160

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT

OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 160,

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 51

(SFAS 160). SFAS 160 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR THE NONCONTROLLING

INTEREST IN A SUBSIDIARY. SFAS 160 ALSO REQUIRES THAT A RETAINED NONCONTROLLING INTEREST UPON THE DECONSOLIDATION OF A SUBSIDIARY BE INITIALLY MEASURED AT ITS FAIR VALUE. SFAS 160 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2010 FISCAL YEAR. UPON ADOPTION

OF SFAS 160, THE COMPANY WILL BE REQUIRED TO REPORT ITS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE COMPANY WILL ALSO BE REQUIRED TO PRESENT NET INCOME ALLOCABLE TO THE NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND NET INCOME

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY SEPARATELY IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. CURRENTLY, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS (MINORITY INTERESTS) ARE REPORTED BETWEEN LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY IN THE COMPANYS

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND THE RELATED INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO MINORITY INTERESTS IS REFLECTED AS AN EXPENSE IN ARRIVING AT NET INCOME. SFAS 160 REQUIRES RETROACTIVE ADOPTION OF THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR EXISTING

MINORITY INTERESTS. ALL OTHER REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS 160 ARE TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY.

SFAS 159

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 159,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL

LIABILITIES  INCLUDING AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 115

(SFAS 159). SFAS 159 GIVES THE COMPANY THE IRREVOCABLE OPTION TO CARRY MOST FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN

EARNINGS. SFAS 159 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2009 FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 159 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SFAS 158

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106, AND 132(R) (SFAS 158). THIS STATEMENT

REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CHANGES IN THAT FUNDED STATUS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR. SFAS 158 ALSO REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF THE FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN AS OF THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE RECOGNITION PROVISION OF SFAS 158 IN FISCAL YEAR 2007 WHICH

RESULTED IN A $261 MILLION CHARGE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2009 WHICH WILL RESULT IN A REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY $40

MILLION TO RETAINED EARNINGS.

SFAS 157

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

(SFAS 157). SFAS 157 PROVIDES A COMMON DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE AND ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK TO MAKE THE MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE IN GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES MORE CONSISTENT AND COMPARABLE. SFAS 157 ALSO REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE IS USED TO MEASURE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS USED TO

MEASURE FAIR VALUE, AND THE EFFECT OF FAIR VALUE MEASURES ON EARNINGS. SFAS 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2009 FISCAL YEAR. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP SFAS NO. 157-2,

EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB STATEMENT

NO. 157

(FSP 157-2), WHICH DELAYS THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR SFAS 157 FOR ALL NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND NONFINANCIAL LIABILITIES UNTIL THE COMPANYS 2010 FISCAL YEAR. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT

THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 157 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SAB 108

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE SEC STAFF ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108,

CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(SAB 108). SAB 108 WAS ISSUED IN

ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE SURROUNDING HOW PUBLIC COMPANIES QUANTIFY FINANCIAL STATEMENT MISSTATEMENTS. SAB 108 REQUIRES THAT REGISTRANTS QUANTIFY ERRORS USING BOTH A BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME STATEMENT APPROACH AND EVALUATE WHETHER

EITHER APPROACH RESULTS IN A MISSTATED AMOUNT THAT, WHEN ALL RELEVANT QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED, IS MATERIAL. THE COMPANY ADOPTED SAB 108 AT THE END OF FISCAL 2007, AND THE ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FIN 48

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

(FIN 48). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING A MINIMUM PROBABILITY THRESHOLD THAT A TAX POSITION

MUST MEET BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED IN FIN 48 AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY

RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE

SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY ADOPTED FIN 48 AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. APPLYING FIN 48 TO ALL EXISTING TAX POSITIONS UPON ADOPTION RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS OF $148 MILLION AND $15 MILLION TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS AND MINORITY INTERESTS,

RESPECTIVELY.

REPORTING PERIOD

THE

COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE SATURDAY CLOSEST TO SEPTEMBER 30 AND CONSISTS OF FIFTY-TWO WEEKS WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS, WE HAVE A FIFTY-THREE WEEK YEAR. WHEN A FIFTY-THREE WEEK YEAR OCCURS, THE COMPANY

REPORTS THE ADDITIONAL WEEK IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. FISCAL 2009 IS A FIFTY-THREE WEEK YEAR BEGINNING ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2008 AND ENDING ON OCTOBER 3, 2009.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE FISCAL 2007 AND FISCAL 2006 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

NOTES TO CONFORM TO THE FISCAL 2008 PRESENTATION.

AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY BEGAN REPORTING HYPERION PUBLISHING IN THE

MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT. PREVIOUSLY, HYPERION PUBLISHING HAD BEEN REPORTED IN THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT. PRIOR-YEAR AMOUNTS (WHICH ARE NOT MATERIAL) HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FOOTNOTES THERETO. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE

ESTIMATES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

BROADCAST ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN COMMERCIALS ARE AIRED. REVENUES FROM TELEVISION SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS PRIMARY CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. CERTAIN OF

THE COMPANYS EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS INCLUDE ANNUAL LIVE PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS. IN THESE CASES, RECOGNITION OF REVENUES SUBJECT TO THE COMMITMENTS IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE ANNUAL COMMITMENTS ARE SATISFIED, WHICH

GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES ARE

RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. FOR NON-EXPIRING, MULTI-DAY TICKETS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER A THREE-YEAR TIME PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE PATTERNS THAT ARE DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS. REVENUES FROM CORPORATE SPONSORS AT THE

THEME PARKS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD OF THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENTS COMMENCING WITH THE OPENING OF THE RELATED ATTRACTION.

REVENUES FROM THE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION OF MOTION PICTURES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN MOTION PICTURES ARE EXHIBITED. REVENUES FROM VIDEO AND VIDEO GAME SALES, NET OF ANTICIPATED RETURNS AND CUSTOMER INCENTIVES, ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE DATE THAT

VIDEO UNITS ARE MADE AVAILABLE FOR SALE BY RETAILERS. REVENUES FROM THE LICENSING OF FEATURE FILMS AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ARE RECORDED WHEN THE MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE FOR TELECAST BY THE LICENSEE AND WHEN CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS ARE MET.

72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MERCHANDISE LICENSING ADVANCES AND GUARANTEE ROYALTY PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL

ROYALTY RATE WHEN THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS SOLD BY THE LICENSEE. NON-REFUNDABLE ADVANCES AND MINIMUM GUARANTEE ROYALTY PAYMENTS IN EXCESS OF ROYALTIES EARNED ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AT THE END OF THE CONTRACT TERM.

TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME ON A NET BASIS.

ADVERTISING EXPENSE

ADVERTISING COSTS

ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WAS $2.9 BILLION, $2.6 BILLION AND $2.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH AND

CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH ON HAND AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS

OR LESS.

INVESTMENTS

DEBT SECURITIES

THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE POSITIVE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND REPORTED AT AMORTIZED COST. DEBT SECURITIES NOT CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE

CLASSIFIED AS EITHER TRADING OR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, AND ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN EARNINGS OR ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/(LOSS), RESPECTIVELY. ALL OTHER EQUITY

SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING EITHER THE COST METHOD OR THE EQUITY METHOD.

THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS TO DETERMINE

WHETHER A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW THE COST BASIS IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. IF THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE WRITE-DOWN IS

INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

TRANSLATION POLICY

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR EURO DISNEY, HONG KONG DISNEYLAND, JETIX AND INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS OF

THE DISNEY STORES.

FOR U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY LOCATIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REMEASURED INTO U.S. DOLLARS

AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR NONMONETARY BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING EACH PERIOD, EXCEPT FOR THOSE EXPENSES

RELATED TO THE NON-MONETARY BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME.

FOR LOCAL CURRENCY FUNCTIONAL LOCATIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED AT END-OF-PERIOD RATES WHILE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT

AVERAGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD. EQUITY IS TRANSLATED AT HISTORICAL RATES AND THE RESULTING CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INVENTORIES

CARRYING AMOUNTS OF MERCHANDISE,

MATERIALS, AND SUPPLIES INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A MOVING AVERAGE COST BASIS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.

FILM AND

TELEVISION COSTS

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS INCLUDE CAPITALIZABLE PRODUCTION COSTS, PRODUCTION OVERHEAD, INTEREST, DEVELOPMENT COSTS,

AND ACQUIRED PRODUCTION COSTS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR FAIR VALUE. ACQUIRED PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR THE COMPANYS TELEVISION AND CABLE NETWORKS ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED

AMORTIZATION, OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ACQUIRED TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE RECORDED WHEN THE LICENSE PERIOD BEGINS AND THE PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE FOR USE. MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE

EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND PARTICIPATION COSTS ARE EXPENSED BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS

GROSS REVENUES TO ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FROM ALL SOURCES ON AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION BASIS. ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE

73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION NETWORK SERIES, WE INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DELIVERY OF THE FIRST

EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER. FOR ACQUIRED FILM LIBRARIES, REMAINING REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO BE EARNED FOR UP TO TWENTY YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. COSTS OF

FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS WHICH COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WITH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS EXCEED THEIR ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUES IS WRITTEN OFF. FILM DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED OR HAVE NOT BEEN SET FOR PRODUCTION WITHIN THREE YEARS ARE GENERALLY WRITTEN OFF.

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS

APPROPRIATE. RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO ULTIMATE REVENUES (THE PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD) OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE CONTRACT

PERIOD, AS APPROPRIATE. ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS INCLUDE BOTH ADVERTISING REVENUES AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE FEES. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON OVER THE TERM OF A MULTI-YEAR SPORTS

PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENT APPROXIMATE EACH SEASONS RIGHTS COST BASED ON THE PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED ANNUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN-OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR

SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM.

THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF NETWORK TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS IS REVIEWED USING A DAYPART

METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE EARLY MORNING, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN, AND SPORTS

(INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL.

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE COSTS

THE COMPANY EXPENSES COSTS INCURRED IN THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE OF DEVELOPING OR ACQUIRING

INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE, SUCH AS RESEARCH AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES, AS WELL AS COSTS INCURRED IN THE POST-IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONAL STAGE, SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING. CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OCCURS ONLY AFTER THE

PRELIMINARY-PROJECT STAGE IS COMPLETE, MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZES THE PROJECT, AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETED AND THE SOFTWARE WILL BE USED FOR THE FUNCTION INTENDED. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007,

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS, NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION, TOTALED $526 MILLION AND $555 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE, RANGING FROM 3-10 YEARS.

SOFTWARE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS

SOFTWARE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCURRED PRIOR TO REACHING TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY ARE EXPENSED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE SOFTWARE IS NOT ESTABLISHED UNTIL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS

COMPLETE.

PARKS, RESORTS AND OTHER PROPERTY

PARKS, RESORTS, AND OTHER PROPERTY ARE CARRIED AT HISTORICAL COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED ON THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AS FOLLOWS.

ATTRACTIONS

25  40 YEARS

BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST AT FISCAL YEAR END FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING FCC LICENSES AND

TRADEMARKS. AS REQUIRED BY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(SFAS 142), GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ONE LEVEL BELOW OUR OPERATING

SEGMENTS.

TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING

UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN

74

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING

VALUE OF ITS GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE, EXCEPT FOR THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, A BUSINESS WITHIN THE MEDIA NETWORKS OPERATING SEGMENT, FOR WHICH WE USED A REVENUE MULTIPLE. WE USED A REVENUE MULTIPLE AS A PRESENT

VALUE TECHNIQUE MAY NOT CONSISTENTLY CAPTURE THE FULL FAIR VALUE OF THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, AND THERE IS LITTLE COMPARABLE MARKET DATA AVAILABLE DUE TO THE SCARCITY OF TELEVISION NETWORKS. WE APPLIED WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE

VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF

AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.

WE COMPLETED OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, WHICH RESULTED IN A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $39 MILLION RELATED TO ESPN RADIO

AND RADIO DISNEY FCC LICENSES. DURING FISCAL YEARS 2007 AND 2006, THE COMPANY RECORDED NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $26 MILLION AND $32 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO ESPN RADIO AND RADIO DISNEY FCC LICENSES. THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REFLECTED

OVERALL MARKET DECLINES IN CERTAIN RADIO MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PRINCIPALLY COPYRIGHTS, ARE GENERALLY

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER PERIODS OF UP TO 31 YEARS.

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS; FORWARD, OPTION AND SWAPTION CONTRACTS AND INTEREST RATE CAPS.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES

FOR UNDERTAKING VARIOUS HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DERIVATIVES INTO WHICH THE COMPANY ENTERS: HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AND HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE. HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE THE FAIR

VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED ASSET, LIABILITY, OR A FIRM COMMITMENT. HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION (E.G. FORECASTED REVENUE) OR THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED, RELATED TO A

RECOGNIZED LIABILITY OR ASSET (E.G. FLOATING RATE DEBT).

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES AND ASSIGNS THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGES OF

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFIC ASSETS OR SPECIFIC LIABILITIES. WHEN HEDGED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE SOLD OR EXTINGUISHED OR THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE

DESIGNATED HEDGING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OPTION PREMIUMS AND UNREALIZED GAINS ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR

INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS OTHER ASSETS. UNREALIZED LOSSES ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID

UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LIABILITIES. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES THE DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE

AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS AS INTEREST RATES AND EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIVES OF THE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE TERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE SWAP AGREEMENTS, PRIOR

TO THEIR ORIGINAL MATURITY, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THESE CONTRACTS ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET CERTAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURES OF THE COMPANY AND ARE CARRIED AT MARKET VALUE

WITH ANY CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (SEE NOTES 7

AND 13).

INCOME TAXES

THE COMPANY

ACCOUNTS FOR CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAXES IN ACCORDANCE WITH FAS 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

. WHEN APPROPRIATE, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED WITH RESPECT TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IN THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF

ITEMS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. WHERE, BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME AMOUNT OF RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS

ESTABLISHED FOR THAT AMOUNT THAT, IN MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, IS SUFFICIENT TO REDUCE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

(FIN 48). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING A MINIMUM PROBABILITY

THRESHOLD THAT A TAX POSITION MUST MEET BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED IN FIN 48 AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING

AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT

LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. THE COMPANY ADOPTED FIN 48 AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. APPLYING FIN 48 TO ALL TAX POSITIONS UPON ADOPTION RESULTED IN REDUCTIONS OF $148 MILLION AND $15 MILLION TO OPENING

RETAINED EARNINGS AND MINORITY INTERESTS, RESPECTIVELY.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

THE COMPANY PRESENTS BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AMOUNTS. BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE

NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EPS IS BASED UPON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR WHICH IS CALCULATED USING THE TREASURY-STOCK METHOD FOR EQUITY-BASED AWARDS

AND ASSUMES CONVERSION OF THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES WHICH WERE REDEEMED DURING THE YEAR (SEE NOTE 7). COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION IN PERIODS FOR WHICH THEY HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT. STOCK OPTIONS

FOR WHICH THE EXERCISE PRICE EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OVER THE PERIOD ARE ANTI-DILUTIVE AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION.

A RECONCILIATION OF INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR CALCULATING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS IS AS

AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 EXCHANGE RATES). AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, BOTH FACILITIES HAD A RATE OF HIBOR + 1.25%.

HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS

COMMERCIAL TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT CONTAINED SEMI-ANNUAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COVENANTS AND HAD AN ORIGINAL MATURITY OF OCTOBER 26, 2015. IN ANTICIPATION OF THE PROSPECT THAT THE COVENANTS WOULD NOT BE MET FOR FISCAL 2007,

THE AGREEMENT WAS AMENDED IN 2007 TO REMOVE THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COVENANTS, SHORTEN THE MATURITY OF THE LOAN TO SEPTEMBER 30, 2008 AND DECREASE THE AMOUNT OF THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY FROM HK$1.0 BILLION (APPROXIMATELY $129 MILLION) TO

HK$800 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $103 MILLION).

SUBSEQUENT TO THE END OF FISCAL 2008, ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2008, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A

TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT WITH HONG KONG DISNEYLAND PURSUANT TO WHICH HONG KONG DISNEYLAND BORROWED HK$2.3 BILLION (APPROXIMATELY $292 MILLION) UNDER A TERM LOAN AND HK$700 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION) UNDER A HK$1.0

BILLION ($129 MILLION) REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. THESE FUNDS WERE USED TO REPAY HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS COMMERCIAL TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY. BOTH THE TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY HAVE AN EFFECTIVE MATURITY DATE OF

SEPTEMBER 2013.

TO SUPPORT HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS NEAR-TERM OPERATING NEEDS, THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO WAIVE MANAGEMENT FEES FOR

FISCAL 2008 AND FISCAL 2009 AND DEFER ROYALTIES FOR THOSE YEARS, WITH PAYMENT OF THE DEFERRED ROYALTIES DEPENDENT UPON THE FUTURE OPERATING PERFORMANCE OF HONG KONG DISNEYLAND. THE COMPANY MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT TO MEET HONG KONG

DISNEYLANDS LONGER-TERM FINANCIAL AND DEVELOPMENT NEEDS.

HAS AN UNSECURED LOAN FACILITY OF HK$5.6 BILLION ($722 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 EXCHANGE RATES) FROM ITS OTHER SHAREHOLDER, THAT IS SCHEDULED TO MATURE ON DATES THROUGH SEPTEMBER 12, 2030. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE LOAN FACILITY, INTEREST

INCURRED PRIOR TO MARCH 2006 OF HK$433 MILLION ($56 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 EXCHANGE RATES) IS NOT PAYABLE UNTIL THE LOAN MATURES AND IS THEREFORE CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM BORROWINGS. IN ADDITION, PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE LOAN FACILITY,

INTEREST INCURRED SUBSEQUENT TO MARCH 2006 OF HK$759 MILLION ($98 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 EXCHANGE RATES) IS PAYABLE DEPENDENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL MEASUREMENTS AND IS ALSO CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM BORROWINGS. THE INTEREST

RATE ON THIS LOAN IS SUBJECT TO BIANNUAL REVISIONS, BUT IS CAPPED AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF 6.75% (UNTIL MARCH 12, 2014), 7.625% (UNTIL MARCH 12, 2022) AND 8.50% (UNTIL SEPTEMBER 12, 2030). AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE RATE ON THE LOANS WAS 6.75%.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE PRINCIPALLY RELATES TO THE $316 MILLION DEFERRED TAX ASSET FOR THE

MINORITY INTEREST SHARE OF OPERATING LOSSES AT EURO DISNEY. BASED ON EURO DISNEYS HISTORICAL RESULTS, NO DEFERRED TAX ASSET HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN RECORDED FOR THESE NET OPERATING LOSSES DUE TO THE REMOTE LIKELIHOOD OF THEIR UTILIZATION. IN 2008,

THE RESULTS OF EURO DISNEY WERE SUCH THAT MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT CHANGED RELATING TO THESE NET OPERATING LOSSES, AND A DEFERRED TAX ASSET WITH AN OFFSETTING VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN THE AMOUNT OF $316 MILLION WAS RECORDED. THE ULTIMATE UTILIZATION

OF THESE NET OPERATING LOSSES WOULD NOT HAVE A NET IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME AS ANY INCOME TAX BENEFIT WOULD BE OFFSET BY A CHARGE TO MINORITY INTEREST IN THE INCOME STATEMENT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF CERTAIN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OF

APPROXIMATELY $119 MILLION, FOR WHICH DEFERRED TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REINVEST THESE EARNINGS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IF THESE AMOUNTS WERE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES, IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHERWISE,

THE COMPANY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL U.S. INCOME TAXES. DETERMINATION OF THE AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITIES ON THESE EARNINGS IS NOT PRACTICABLE BECAUSE SUCH LIABILITY, IF ANY, IS DEPENDENT ON CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING IF

AND WHEN REMITTANCE OCCURS.

IN 2008 THE COMPANY DERIVED TAX BENEFITS OF $9 MILLION FROM AN EXCLUSION PROVIDED UNDER U.S.

INCOME TAX LAWS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO FOREIGN TRADING GROSS RECEIPTS (FTGRS). THIS EXCLUSION WAS REPEALED AS PART OF THE

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

(THE ACT), WHICH WAS

ENACTED ON OCTOBER 22, 2004. THE ACT PROVIDES FOR A PHASE-OUT SUCH THAT THE EXCLUSION FOR THE COMPANYS OTHERWISE QUALIFYING FTGRS GENERATED IN FISCAL 2005, 2006 AND 2007 ARE LIMITED TO APPROXIMATELY 85%, 65% AND 15%, RESPECTIVELY. NO

EXCLUSION IS AVAILABLE FOR TRANSACTIONS ORIGINATING AFTER THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007.

THE ACT MADE A NUMBER OF OTHER CHANGES TO THE

INCOME TAX LAWS INCLUDING THE CREATION OF A NEW DEDUCTION RELATING TO QUALIFYING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES WHICH WILL AFFECT THE COMPANY IN THE CURRENT AND FUTURE YEARS. THE DEDUCTION EQUALS THREE PERCENT OF QUALIFYING NET INCOME FOR FISCAL

2006 AND 2007, SIX PERCENT FOR FISCAL 2008 THROUGH 2010, AND NINE PERCENT FOR FISCAL 2011 AND THEREAFTER. OUR TAX PROVISIONS FOR FISCAL 2008, FISCAL 2007 AND FISCAL 2006 REFLECT BENEFITS OF $97 MILLION, $41 MILLION AND $25 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

RESULTING FROM THIS DEDUCTION.

AS OF

SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD $127 MILLION AND $137 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF ACCRUED INTEREST RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. DURING THE CURRENT YEAR, THE COMPANY ACCRUED ADDITIONAL INTEREST OF $47

MILLION, AND RECORDED A $57 MILLION REDUCTION OF ACCRUED INTEREST AS A RESULT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS AND OTHER PRIOR YEAR ADJUSTMENTS. THE COMPANYS POLICY IS TO REPORT INTEREST AND PENALTIES AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

DURING THE CURRENT YEAR, THE COMPANY REACHED RESOLUTION WITH RESPECT TO THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICES EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANYS FEDERAL

INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2001 THROUGH 2004. THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO STATE AND LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX AUDITS. IN THE CURRENT YEAR, THE CALIFORNIA EXAMINATION OF FISCAL YEARS 1997 THROUGH 1999 WAS COMPLETED AND THE NEW YORK COURT OF

APPEALS RENDERED A DECISION REGARDING THE REMAINING TAX MATTERS FROM FISCAL YEARS 1990 THROUGH 1995. IN LIGHT OF THE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS, THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION IN ANY OF ITS MAJOR STATE OR FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS

FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2000.

IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT A MATERIAL NET CHANGE IN UNRECOGNIZED TAX

IN FISCAL YEARS 2008, 2007 AND 2006, INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE

ASSUMPTIONS

CERTAIN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS THE DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE, HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST AS

WELL AS THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AMOUNTS.

DISCOUNT RATE

 THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE FOR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL PLANS REFLECTS THE MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY

CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

 THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM RETURNS ON AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTING OF A MIXTURE OF EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS. WHEN DETERMINING THE

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON THE ASSET CLASSES (BOTH HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED) IN WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE PENSION FUNDS TO BE INVESTED. THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN BY

ASSET CLASS WERE CONSIDERED IN SETTING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION.

EQUITY SECURITIES

8%  10%

DEBT SECURITIES

4%    7%

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS

8%  20%

HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE

 THE COMPANY REVIEWS EXTERNAL DATA AND ITS OWN HISTORICAL

TRENDS FOR HEALTHCARE COSTS TO DETERMINE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATES FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS. FOR THE 2008 ACTUARIAL VALUATION, WE ASSUMED A 9.0% ANNUAL RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE CLAIMS

WITH THE RATE DECREASING IN EVEN INCREMENTS OVER EIGHT YEARS UNTIL REACHING 5.0%.

A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT (PPT) CHANGE IN THE KEY

ASSUMPTIONS WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS ON THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND ON COST FOR FISCAL 2009.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

AS OF THE FILING DATE OF THIS REPORT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD NOT YET DECLARED A DIVIDEND RELATED TO FISCAL 2008. THE COMPANY PAID A $664 MILLION

DIVIDEND ($0.35 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2008 RELATED TO FISCAL 2007. THE COMPANY PAID A $637 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.31 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007 RELATED TO FISCAL 2006. THE COMPANY PAID A $519 MILLION

DIVIDEND ($0.27 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006 RELATED TO FISCAL 2005.

DURING FISCAL 2008, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED

139 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $4.5 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2007, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 202 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $6.9 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 243 MILLION SHARES OF

DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $6.9 BILLION. ON MAY 1, 2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY INCREASED THE SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION TO A TOTAL OF 400 MILLION SHARES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD REMAINING

AUTHORIZATION IN PLACE TO REPURCHASE 184 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE.

REDEMPTION).

THE PAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $26 MILLION.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS 1.0 BILLION SHARES OF INTERNET GROUP STOCK AT $.01 PAR VALUE AUTHORIZED. NO SHARES ARE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING.

11

EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

UNDER VARIOUS PLANS, THE COMPANY MAY GRANT STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY-BASED AWARDS TO EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT, AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL. THE

COMPANYS APPROACH TO LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION CONTEMPLATES AWARDS OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS).

STOCK

OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY GRANTED AT EXERCISE PRICES EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING THE MARKET PRICE AT THE DATE OF GRANT. EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2003, OPTIONS BECAME EXERCISABLE RATABLY OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE GRANT DATE, WHILE OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO

JANUARY 2003 GENERALLY VEST RATABLY OVER FIVE YEARS. EFFECTIVE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005, OPTIONS GRANTED GENERALLY EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE, WHILE OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005 GENERALLY EXPIRE TEN YEARS

AFTER THE GRANT DATE. AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OPTIONS CAN OCCASIONALLY EXTEND UP TO 15 YEARS AFTER DATE OF GRANT. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GENERALLY VEST 50% ON EACH OF THE SECOND AND

FOURTH ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT DATE. CERTAIN RSUS AWARDED TO SENIOR EXECUTIVES VEST BASED UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF MARKET AND/OR PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS. STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS ARE GENERALLY FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES WHO TERMINATE PRIOR TO VESTING.

SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE OPTION AND RSU GRANTS AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 TOTALED 56 MILLION. THE COMPANY SATISFIES STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF RSUS WITH NEWLY ISSUED SHARES.

EACH YEAR, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY AWARDS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO A BROAD-BASED GROUP OF MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVE

PERSONNEL (THE ANNUAL GRANT). THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS VOLATILITY, DIVIDEND YIELD, AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE. THE BINOMIAL

VALUATION MODEL ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE (THE

95

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MULTIPLE OF EXERCISE PRICE TO GRANT PRICE AT WHICH EXERCISES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON AVERAGE) AND THE TERMINATION RATE (THE PROBABILITY OF A VESTED OPTION

BEING CANCELLED DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE OPTION HOLDER) IN COMPUTING THE VALUE OF THE OPTION.

IN FISCAL YEARS 2008, 2007 AND 2006,

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OPTION-PRICING MODELS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS NOT ADJUSTED AFTER THE GRANT DATE, CHANGES IN

THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE THE VALUE OF, AND THEREFORE THE EXPENSE RELATED TO, FUTURE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE GREATEST VARIATION IN FAIR VALUE IN THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ARE THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND

EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN EITHER THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE WILL CAUSE THE BINOMIAL OPTION VALUE TO INCREASE OR DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION CONSIDERS BOTH HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS CHANGES IN

ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS AND STOCK OPTIONS IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIOD.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS IS BASED UPON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE AWARDS ON THE GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITY THAT THE MARKET AND/OR PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS

WILL BE MET.

THE IMPACT OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS ON INCOME AND CASH FLOW FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WAS AS

IN ANTICIPATION OF THE ABC RADIO TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY NEEDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER EMPLOYEE EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION

AWARDS WOULD BE ADJUSTED FOR THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF THE TRANSACTION ON OUTSTANDING EMPLOYEE AWARDS. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS PLANS REQUIRED SUCH ADJUSTMENTS TO BE MADE ON AN EQUITABLE BASIS. ALL OTHER PLANS PERMITTED SUCH ADJUSTMENTS TO BE

MADE. IN ORDER TO TREAT ALL EMPLOYEES CONSISTENTLY WITH RESPECT TO THE ABC RADIO TRANSACTION (AND OTHER SIMILAR FUTURE TRANSACTIONS), THE COMPANY AMENDED THE PLANS SUCH THAT ALL PLANS REQUIRE EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENTS FOR SUCH TRANSACTIONS. IN

CONNECTION WITH THESE AMENDMENTS, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO RECORD A NON-CASH CHARGE OF $48 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007 REPRESENTING THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THIS MODIFICATION WITH RESPECT TO VESTED EQUITY-BASED EMPLOYEE

COMPENSATION AWARDS.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED

TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS BORROWING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND ON THE MARKET VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS ITS FIXED RATE DEBT EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE.

THE COMPANY TYPICALLY USES PAY-FLOATING AND PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO FACILITATE ITS INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. PAY-FLOATING SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS

TO VARIABLE RATE INSTRUMENTS INDEXED TO LIBOR. PAY-FIXED SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS TO FIXED RATE INSTRUMENTS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007 RESPECTIVELY, THE COMPANY HELD $266 MILLION AND $157

MILLION NOTIONAL VALUE OF PAY-FIXED SWAPS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES. THE CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES OF ALL SWAPS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS.

THE IMPACT OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR FISCAL 2008, 2007 AND 2006. THE NET AMOUNT OF DEFERRED GAINS IN AOCI FROM INTEREST RATE RISK

MANAGEMENT TRANSACTIONS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY TRANSACTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE

EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES THEREBY ENABLING MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, FIRM COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED BUT NOT FIRMLY

COMMITTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY USES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY HEDGES ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS FOR PERIODS GENERALLY NOT

TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM RANGE OF ANNUAL EXPOSURE. THE COMPANY USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FIRM COMMITMENTS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN

THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED FORECASTED TRANSACTION, ASSET, LIABILITY OR FIRM COMMITMENT. THE PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY

CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLARS.

MARK TO MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON CONTRACTS HEDGING FORECASTED FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED TO AOCI AND ARE RECLASSIFIED TO CURRENT EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE REALIZED, OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND

SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD PRE-TAX DEFERRED GAINS OF $229 MILLION AND $114 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND PRE-TAX DEFERRED LOSSES OF $96 MILLION AND $170 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES ON FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSACTIONS.

DEFERRED AMOUNTS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WILL CHANGE WITH MARKET CONDITIONS AND WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES

IN THE VALUE OF THE RELATED HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. PRE-TAX NET DEFERRED GAINS RECORDED IN AOCI FOR CONTRACTS THAT WILL MATURE IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS TOTALED $25 MILLION. THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED AFTER-TAX GAINS OF $125 MILLION AND LOSSES OF $34

MILLION FROM AOCI TO EARNINGS DURING FISCAL 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THESE GAINS AND LOSSES WERE OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED.

DURING FISCAL 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY RECORDED THE CHANGE IN FAIR MARKET VALUE RELATED TO HEDGES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, REALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CASH FLOW HEDGES AND THE INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES TO EARNINGS. THE AMOUNTS OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ON CASH FLOW HEDGES WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR FISCAL 2008, FISCAL 2007 AND FISCAL 2006. THE TOTAL IMPACT OF

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ON OPERATING INCOME IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE LOSSES OF $224 MILLION, $139 MILLION, AND $27 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE NET LOSSES FROM THESE HEDGES OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF

THE RELATED EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED.

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS WITH, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE COUNTERPARTIES TO ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY THE

COUNTERPARTIES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A $91 MILLION SETTLEMENT DEFAULT BY LEHMAN BROTHERS COMMERCIAL CORPORATION THAT OCCURRED IN SEPTEMBER 2008. THE COMPANY IS PURSUING COLLECTION OF THIS AMOUNT, BUT HAS FULLY RESERVED THE AMOUNT.

THE COMPANY WOULD NOT REALIZE A MATERIAL LOSS, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, IN THE

EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY SINGLE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS ONLY WITH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF A- OR BETTER. THE COMPANYS CURRENT POLICY REGARDING AGREEMENTS WITH DERIVATIVE

COUNTERPARTIES IS GENERALLY TO REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A- OR IN THE EVENT AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED LIMITS AS DEFINED BY CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY

ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE MATERIAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE A CREDIT

RATING OF LESS THAN A-. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD BALANCES WITH THREE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT AGGREGATED TO 63% AND 53% OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES AND INVESTMENTS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AT SEPTEMBER 27, 2008 DUE TO THE

WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS INTO WHICH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD, THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO AMONG ISSUERS.

FUND THE SHORTFALL. AS OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2008, THE REMAINING DEBT SERVICE OBLIGATION GUARANTEED BY THE COMPANY WAS $380 MILLION, OF WHICH $100 MILLION WAS PRINCIPAL. TO THE EXTENT THAT TAX REVENUES EXCEED THE DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS IN SUBSEQUENT

LEGAL MATTERS

MILNE AND

DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. V. STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC.

ON NOVEMBER 5, 2002, CLARE MILNE, THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A. A. MILNE, AUTHOR OF THE WINNIE THE POOH BOOKS, AND THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. (DEI) FILED A COMPLAINT

AGAINST STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. (SSI) IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2002, MS. MILNE SERVED NOTICES TO SSI AND DEI TERMINATING A. A. MILNES PRIOR GRANT OF RIGHTS TO

WINNIE THE POOH, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004, AND GRANTED ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS TO DEI. IN THEIR LAWSUIT, MS. MILNE AND DEI SOUGHT A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, UNDER UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT LAW, THAT MS. MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE

VALID; THAT SSIS RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH IN THE UNITED STATES TERMINATED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004; THAT UPON TERMINATION OF SSIS RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE

STEPHEN

SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

LAWSUIT (THE STATE COURT ACTION) TERMINATED BY OPERATION OF LAW; AND THAT, AS OF NOVEMBER 5, 2004, SSI WAS ENTITLED TO NO FURTHER ROYALTIES FOR USES OF WINNIE THE POOH. SSI FILED

(A) AN ANSWER DENYING THE MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT AND (B) COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT (I) MS. MILNES GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI IS VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE AND (II) DEI REMAINS OBLIGATED TO PAY SSI

ROYALTIES UNDER THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT. THE DISTRICT COURT RULED THAT MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE INVALID. THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED, AND ON JUNE 26, 2006, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

DENIED MILNES PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI. ON AUGUST 1, 2003, SSI FILED AN AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS AND A THIRD-PARTY COMPLAINT AGAINST HARRIET HUNT (HEIR TO E. H. SHEPARD, ILLUSTRATOR OF THE ORIGINAL WINNIE THE POOH

STORIES), WHO HAD SERVED A NOTICE OF TERMINATION AND A GRANT OF RIGHTS SIMILAR TO MS. MILNES, AND ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE MILNE AND HUNT TERMINATIONS AND THE GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI FOR

(A) UNLAWFUL AND UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES; AND (B) BREACH OF THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT.

ON OCTOBER 19, 2006, THE

PARTIES STIPULATED TO SSIS FILING ITS FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS (FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER) SEEKING (A) TO INVALIDATE THE HUNT TERMINATION NOTICE, (B) TO TERMINATE THE COMPANYS RIGHTS VIS-À-VIS SSI, AND

(C) DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS, AMONG OTHER RELIEF. THAT STIPULATION ALSO PROVIDED THAT HUNT AND THE COMPANY NEED NOT RESPOND TO THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF TWO EVENTS: THE STATE COURT APPEAL IN

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

, AND THE TRIAL IN THE DISTRICT COURT ON THE VALIDITY OF THE HUNT TERMINATION NOTICE. SSI THEN SOUGHT TO WITHDRAW BOTH THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND ITS STIPULATION, BUT ON

NOVEMBER 3, 2006, THE DISTRICT COURT DENIED THAT REQUEST. SSIS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON THE VALIDITY OF HUNTS 2002 ATTEMPT TO RECAPTURE E. H. SHEPARDS RIGHTS WAS GRANTED ON FEBRUARY 15, 2007, AND THEREAFTER, ON

MARCH 27, 2007, THE DISTRICT COURT DISMISSED AS MOOT ALL CLAIMS AGAINST HUNT AND THREE OF SSIS COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY RELATED TO THE COMPANYS AGREEMENTS WITH MILNE AND HUNT CONCERNING THE TERMINATION AND DISPOSITION OF

THEIR RIGHTS. ON JANUARY 3, 2008, THE CALIFORNIA SUPREME COURT DENIED SSIS PETITION FOR REVIEW IN THE STATE COURT ACTION, WHEREUPON ON APRIL 21, 2008, THE COMPANY MOVED FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON ALL OF SSIS CLAIMS IN THE DISTRICT

COURT ACTION. ON JUNE 3, 2008, THE DISTRICT COURT ORDERED FURTHER BRIEFING ON THE ISSUE OF WHETHER SSIS MISCONDUCT IN THE STATE COURT ACTION WARRANTS DISMISSAL OF ALL OF ITS CLAIMS IN THE DISTRICT COURT, AND THEN ON JULY 29, 2008,

THE DISTRICT COURT REFERRED THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION TO A SPECIAL MASTER WHO WILL ISSUE FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS ON THE PRECLUSION AND TERMINATION ISSUES RAISED BY THE MOTION.

RELATEDLY, ON DECEMBER 4, 2006, AUGUST 22, 2007, AND FEBRUARY 8, APRIL 18, AUGUST 27, 2008, AND OCTOBER 31,

2008, SSI INITIATED PROCEEDINGS IN THE UNITED STATES PATENT AND TRADEMARK OFFICE (PTO) SEEKING CANCELLATION OF CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH TRADEMARK REGISTRATIONS AND OPPOSING APPLICATIONS FOR OTHER WINNIE THE POOH TRADEMARKS. THE PTO HAS SUSPENDED ALL

THE PROCEEDINGS ON THE GROUNDS THAT THE RELIEF SOUGHT IS EFFECTIVELY DUPLICATIVE OF THAT SOUGHT IN THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER. ALSO, ON APRIL 18 AND OCTOBER 16, 2008, SSI INITIATED ACTIONS BEFORE THE CANADIAN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OFFICE

(CIPO) OPPOSING APPLICATIONS FOR CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH TRADEMARKS. ON SEPTEMBER 4, 2008, THE COMPANY FILED AN ANSWER TO THE APRIL 18 ACTION BEFORE THE CIPO, DENYING SSIS CLAIMS.

THE COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES, CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR CO-DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS

INVOLVING COPYRIGHT, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE COMPANY TO SUFFER ANY MATERIAL LIABILITY BY REASON OF SUCH ACTIONS.
