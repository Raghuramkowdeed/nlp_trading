COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY

THE COMPANYS MEDIA NETWORKS BUSINESSES COMPETE FOR VIEWERS PRIMARILY WITH OTHER TELEVISION AND CABLE NETWORKS, INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATIONS AND OTHER MEDIA, SUCH AS DVDS, VIDEO GAMES AND THE

INTERNET. WITH RESPECT TO THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME, OUR BROADCASTING OPERATIONS, CERTAIN OF OUR CABLE NETWORKS AND OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS COMPETE WITH OTHER TELEVISION NETWORKS AND RADIO STATIONS, INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATIONS,

MVPDS AND OTHER ADVERTISING MEDIA SUCH AS NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, BILLBOARDS, AND THE INTERNET. OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS PRIMARILY COMPETE FOR VIEWERS IN INDIVIDUAL MARKET AREAS. A TELEVISION OR RADIO STATION IN ONE MARKET GENERALLY DOES NOT

COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH STATIONS IN OTHER MARKETS.

THE GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF NETWORKS DISTRIBUTED BY MVPDS HAS RESULTED IN

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FOR ADVERTISING REVENUES FOR BOTH OUR BROADCASTING AND CABLE NETWORKS. THE COMPANYS CABLE NETWORKS ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER CABLE NETWORKS FOR CARRIAGE BY MVPDS. THE COMPANYS CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS

WITH MVPDS ARE RENEWED OR RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE CABLE AND SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY

TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS VARIOUS CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE.

THE COMPANYS MEDIA NETWORKS BUSINESSES ALSO COMPETE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING. THE MARKET FOR PROGRAMMING IS VERY COMPETITIVE, PARTICULARLY FOR SPORTS PROGRAMMING. THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS SPORTS RIGHTS AGREEMENTS WITH THE NFL, COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL CONFERENCES (INCLUDING COLLEGE FOOTBALL BOWL GAMES), NBA, NASCAR, MLB, WORLD CUP AND VARIOUS SOCCER LEAGUES, AND GOLF AND TENNIS ASSOCIATIONS.

THE COMPANYS INTERNET WEBSITES AND DIGITAL PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH OTHER WEB SITES AND ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE

CATEGORIES.

ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE MEDIA NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP

LEVELS. REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL

PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS ARE MET. THESE COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION DURING THIS PERIOD.



LICENSING OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS.

EACH OF THE TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE OWN MUST BE LICENSED BY THE FCC. THESE LICENSES ARE

GRANTED FOR PERIODS OF UP TO EIGHT YEARS, AND WE MUST OBTAIN RENEWAL OF LICENSES AS THEY EXPIRE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OPERATING THE STATIONS. WE (OR THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN THE CASE OF A DIVESTITURE) MUST ALSO OBTAIN FCC APPROVAL WHENEVER WE SEEK TO

HAVE A LICENSE TRANSFERRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OR DIVESTITURE OF A STATION. THE FCC MAY DECLINE TO RENEW OR APPROVE THE TRANSFER OF A LICENSE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND MAY DELAY RENEWALS WHILE PERMITTING A LICENSEE TO CONTINUE

OPERATING. THE FCC HAS DELAYED RENEWALS FOR A NUMBER OF BROADCAST LICENSEES, INCLUDING A NUMBER OF OUR LICENSES, IN RECENT YEARS WHILE PERMITTING THE LICENSEES TO CONTINUE OPERATING. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE RECEIVED SUCH RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE PAST

OR HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS WHEN RENEWAL IS DELAYED, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL BE THE CASE IN THE FUTURE.



TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP LIMITS.

THE FCC IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN

A SPECIFIC MARKET, ON THE COMBINED NUMBER OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SINGLE MARKET AND ON THE AGGREGATE PERCENTAGE OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE THAT CAN BE REACHED BY TELEVISION STATIONS WE OWN. CURRENTLY.



FCC REGULATIONS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN A MARKET, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND NATURE OF THE MARKET. WE DO NOT

OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN ANY OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN A TELEVISION STATION.



FEDERAL STATUTES PERMIT OUR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE AGGREGATE TO REACH A MAXIMUM OF 39% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE (FOR THIS PURPOSE, FCC REGULATIONS

ATTRIBUTE TO UHF TELEVISION STATIONS ONLY 50% OF THE TELEVISION HOUSEHOLDS IN THEIR MARKET). FOR PURPOSES OF THE FCCS RULES, OUR EIGHT STATIONS REACH APPROXIMATELY 21% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE.



FCC REGULATIONS IN SOME CASES IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL RADIO OR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN

RADIO STATIONS, BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS ARE MATERIAL TO OUR CURRENT OPERATING PLANS.



DUAL NETWORKS.

FCC RULES CURRENTLY PROHIBIT ANY OF THE FOUR MAJOR TELEVISION NETWORKS  ABC, CBS, FOX AND NBC  FROM BEING UNDER

COMMON OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.



REGULATION OF PROGRAMMING.

THE FCC REGULATES BROADCAST PROGRAMMING BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BANNING INDECENT PROGRAMMING, REGULATING

POLITICAL ADVERTISING AND IMPOSING COMMERCIAL TIME LIMITS DURING CHILDRENS PROGRAMMING. BROADCASTERS FACE A HEIGHTENED RISK OF BEING FOUND IN VIOLATION OF THE INDECENCY PROHIBITION BY THE FCC BECAUSE OF RECENT FCC DECISIONS, COUPLED WITH THE

SPONTANEITY OF LIVE PROGRAMMING. IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, THE FCC INCREASED ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES WITH RESPECT TO INDECENCY. PENALTIES FOR BROADCASTING INDECENT PROGRAMMING ARE A MAXIMUM OF $325,000 PER VIOLATION.

FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND FCC RULES ALSO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL MATTER THAT MAY BE SHOWN ON BROADCAST OR CABLE CHANNELS DURING

PROGRAMMING DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN 12 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. IN ADDITION, BROADCAST CHANNELS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF THREE HOURS PER WEEK OF PROGRAMMING THAT HAS AS A SIGNIFICANT PURPOSE MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL

AND INFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN 16 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. FCC RULES ALSO GIVE TELEVISION STATION OWNERS THE RIGHT TO REJECT OR REFUSE NETWORK PROGRAMMING IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO SUBSTITUTE PROGRAMMING THAT THE LICENSEE REASONABLY

BELIEVES TO BE OF GREATER LOCAL OR NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.



CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS.

WITH RESPECT TO CABLE SYSTEMS OPERATING WITHIN A TELEVISION STATIONS

DESIGNATED MARKET AREA, FCC RULES REQUIRE THAT EVERY THREE YEARS EACH TELEVISION STATION ELECT EITHER MUST CARRY STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH CABLE OPERATORS GENERALLY MUST CARRY A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION IN THE STATIONS MARKET, OR

RETRANSMISSION CONSENT STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE CABLE OPERATOR MUST NEGOTIATE WITH THE TELEVISION STATION TO OBTAIN THE CONSENT OF THE TELEVISION STATION PRIOR TO CARRYING ITS SIGNAL. UNDER THE SATELLITE HOME VIEWER IMPROVEMENT ACT

AND ITS SUCCESSORS, INCLUDING MOST RECENTLY THE SATELLITE TELEVISION EXTENSION AND LOCALISM ACT (STELA), WHICH ALSO REQUIRES THE MUST CARRY OR RETRANSMISSION CONSENT ELECTION, SATELLITE CARRIERS ARE PERMITTED TO RETRANSMIT A

LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS SIGNAL INTO ITS LOCAL MARKET WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LOCAL TELEVISION STATION. UNDER MUST CARRY, IF A SATELLITE CARRIER ELECTS TO CARRY ONE LOCAL STATION IN A MARKET, THE SATELLITE CARRIER MUST CARRY THE

SIGNALS OF ALL LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS THAT ALSO REQUEST CARRIAGE.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS

FOR AN

ENTERPRISE AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS THE COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS AFFECTING SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPERATIONS IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF

THESE OPERATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

CHANGES IN U.S., GLOBAL, OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES.

A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR ANY OF

OUR BUSINESSES, THUS REDUCING OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS. THE MOST RECENT DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REDUCED SPENDING AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS, PURCHASE OF AND PRICES FOR ADVERTISING ON OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND OWNED STATIONS,

PERFORMANCE OF OUR HOME ENTERTAINMENT RELEASES, AND PURCHASES OF COMPANY-BRANDED CONSUMER PRODUCTS, AND SIMILAR IMPACTS CAN BE EXPECTED SHOULD SUCH CONDITIONS RECUR. A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO REDUCE ATTENDANCE AT OUR PARKS AND

RESORTS OR PRICES THAT MVPDS PAY FOR OUR CABLE PROGRAMMING. RECENT INSTABILITY IN EUROPEAN ECONOMIES PRESENTS RISKS OF SIMILAR IMPACTS IN OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CAN ALSO IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THOSE WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS TO

SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN PRICE LEVELS GENERALLY, OR IN PRICE LEVELS IN A PARTICULAR SECTOR SUCH AS THE ENERGY SECTOR, COULD RESULT IN A SHIFT IN CONSUMER DEMAND AWAY FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS WE

OFFER, WHICH COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASE OUR COSTS. CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY REDUCE INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCREASE OUR LABOR OR SUPPLY COSTS IN NON-U.S.

MARKETS, OR REDUCE THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER MARKETS, AND ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN A COUNTRY COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COUNTRY OR OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE

REVENUE FROM THE COUNTRY.

CHANGES IN PUBLIC AND CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE

DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR

BUSINESSES CREATE ENTERTAINMENT, TRAVEL OR CONSUMER PRODUCTS WHOSE SUCCESS DEPENDS SUBSTANTIALLY ON CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES THAT CHANGE IN OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO CONSISTENTLY CREATE

AND DISTRIBUTE FILMED ENTERTAINMENT, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ONLINE MATERIAL, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, HOTELS AND OTHER RESORT FACILITIES AND TRAVEL EXPERIENCES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE CHANGING PREFERENCES OF

THE BROAD CONSUMER MARKET. MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON ACCEPTANCE OF OUR OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS BY CONSUMERS OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND THEIR SUCCESS THEREFORE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT AND ADAPT TO CHANGING

CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES OUTSIDE AS WELL AS INSIDE THE U.S. MOREOVER, WE MUST OFTEN INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN FILM PRODUCTION, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, CRUISE SHIPS OR HOTELS AND OTHER

RESORT FACILITIES BEFORE WE LEARN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PRODUCTS WILL EARN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. IF OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, OUR REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING SALES (WHICH ARE BASED IN

PART ON RATINGS FOR THE PROGRAMS IN WHICH ADVERTISEMENTS AIR) OR SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING AND ONLINE SERVICES, FROM THEATRICAL FILM RECEIPTS OR HOME VIDEO OR ELECTRONIC GAME SALES, FROM THEME PARK ADMISSIONS, HOTEL ROOM

CHARGES AND MERCHANDISE, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES, FROM SALES OF LICENSED CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR FROM SALES OF OUR OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY DECLINE OR FAIL TO GROW TO THE EXTENT WE ANTICIPATE WHEN MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND THEREBY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND IN CONSUMER CONSUMPTION PATTERNS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT

PRODUCTS OR THE COST OF PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTS.

THE MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT AND INTERNET BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE

PARTICIPATE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE, DEVELOP, ADOPT AND EXPLOIT NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO DISTINGUISH OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGIES AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THE

MANNER AND MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO CONSUMERS, THE TIME AND MANNER IN WHICH CONSUMERS ACQUIRE AND VIEW SOME OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO ADVERTISERS FOR REACHING THEIR DESIRED MARKETS. FOR

EXAMPLE, THE SUCCESS OF OUR OFFERINGS IN THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET DEPENDS IN PART ON CONSUMER PREFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO HOME ENTERTAINMENT FORMATS, INCLUDING DVD PLAYERS AND DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDERS, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE

HOME ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING WEB-BASED DELIVERY OF ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OFFER CONSUMERS AN EXPANDING ARRAY OF ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS AND DELIVERY VEHICLES WHICH MAY INCLUDE

OPTIONS WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED, OR OPTIONS WE HAVE DEVELOPED BUT WHICH ENTAIL A SMALLER RETURN THAN WE REALIZE ON TRADITIONAL OPTIONS. AS A RESULT, THE INCOME FROM OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS MAY DECLINE OR INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OR OUR EXPECTATIONS WHEN WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCTS.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE

EXISTENCE AND MAINTENANCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE CREATE.

THE VALUE

TO US OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF OUR RIGHTS AS DEFINED BY APPLICABLE LAWS IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THOSE LAWS ARE CONSTRUED. IF THOSE LAWS ARE DRAFTED OR INTERPRETED IN WAYS

THAT LIMIT THE EXTENT OR DURATION OF OUR RIGHTS, OR IF EXISTING LAWS ARE CHANGED, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY DECREASE, OR THE COST OF OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE.

THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF PROTECTING THESE RIGHTS OR REDUCE OUR REVENUES. NEW

TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION, AND ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES, THE FALLING PRICES OF DEVICES INCORPORATING SUCH TECHNOLOGIES, AND INCREASED BROADBAND INTERNET SPEED AND PENETRATION HAVE MADE THE UNAUTHORIZED DIGITAL

COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR FILMS, TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND OTHER CREATIVE WORKS EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MORE CHALLENGING. THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY

GENERALLY CONTINUES TO BE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS HOLDERS. INADEQUATE LAWS OR WEAK ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN ONE COUNTRY CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE, DESPITE THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THESE DEVELOPMENTS REQUIRE US TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST UNLICENSED USE AND PRESENT THE RISK

OF INCREASED LOSSES OF REVENUE AS A RESULT OF UNLICENSED DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION OF OUR CONTENT AND SALES OF UNAUTHORIZED DVDS, BLU-RAY DISCS AND OTHER PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE COMPANY AND RIGHTS ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY FROM OTHERS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF CHALLENGES TO OUR COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK AND PATENT

RIGHTS BY THIRD PARTIES. SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGES TO OUR RIGHTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS FOR OBTAINING RIGHTS OR THE LOSS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN REVENUE FROM THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF CHALLENGED

RIGHTS. THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF ANY CHALLENGES TO ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT IT CURRENTLY FORESEES HAVING A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS.

PROTECTION OF ELECTRONICALLY STORED DATA IS COSTLY AND IF OUR DATA IS COMPROMISED IN SPITE OF THIS PROTECTION, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS, LOST OPPORTUNITIES AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

WE MAINTAIN INFORMATION NECESSARY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AS WELL AS

PERSONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES, IN DIGITAL FORM. DATA MAINTAINED IN DIGITAL FORM IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF INTRUSION, TAMPERING AND THEFT. WE DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SYSTEMS TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING, BUT THE

DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS IS COSTLY AND REQUIRES ONGOING MONITORING AND UPDATING AS TECHNOLOGIES CHANGE AND EFFORTS TO OVERCOME SECURITY MEASURES BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED. MOREOVER, DESPITE OUR EFFORTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF

INTRUSION, TAMPERING AND THEFT CANNOT BE ELIMINATED ENTIRELY, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE REMAIN. IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE CONFIDENTIAL, PROPRIETARY AND PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO PURSUE BUSINESS

OBJECTIVES. WHILE WE OBTAIN ASSURANCES THAT THESE THIRD PARTIES WILL PROTECT THIS INFORMATION AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, MONITOR THE PROTECTIONS EMPLOYED BY THESE THIRD PARTIES, THERE IS A RISK THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES MAY BE

COMPROMISED. IF OUR DATA SYSTEMS ARE COMPROMISED, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS MAY BE IMPAIRED, WE MAY LOSE PROFITABLE OPPORTUNITIES OR THE VALUE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES MAY BE DIMINISHED AND, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE MAY LOSE REVENUE AS A

RESULT OF UNLICENSED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. IF PERSONAL INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES IS

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MISAPPROPRIATED, OUR REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES MAY BE INJURED RESULTING IN LOSS OF BUSINESS OR MORALE, AND WE MAY INCUR COSTS TO REMEDIATE POSSIBLE INJURY TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND

EMPLOYEES OR TO PAY FINES OR TAKE OTHER ACTION WITH RESPECT TO JUDICIAL OR REGULATORY ACTIONS ARISING OUT OF THE INCIDENT.

A VARIETY OF

UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR INCREASE THE COST OF PROVIDING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PARTICULARLY OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS, IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL

AND TOURISM. THE ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM, AS WELL AS DEMAND FOR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE U.S., GLOBALLY OR IN SPECIFIC REGIONS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL,

INCLUDING: ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARISING FROM SHORT-TERM WEATHER PATTERNS OR LONG-TERM CHANGE, CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR NATURAL DISASTERS (SUCH AS EXCESSIVE HEAT OR RAIN, HURRICANES, TYPHOONS, FLOODS, TSUNAMIS AND EARTHQUAKES); HEALTH CONCERNS;

INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL OR MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS; AND TERRORIST ATTACKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN JAPAN IN MARCH 2011 RESULTED IN A PERIOD OF SUSPENSION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND THOSE OF CERTAIN OF OUR LICENSEES IN JAPAN, INCLUDING

TOKYO DISNEY RESORT AND RESULTED IN A LOSS OF REVENUE FROM THOSE OPERATIONS. THESE EVENTS AND OTHERS, SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN TRAVEL AND ENERGY COSTS AND COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACKS, INTRUSIONS OR OTHER WIDESPREAD COMPUTING OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS

FAILURES, MAY ALSO DAMAGE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THESE EVENTS. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE ROYALTIES FROM THE SALES OF OUR LICENSED GOODS AND SERVICES BY THIRD PARTIES AND THE

MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESSES OPERATED UNDER BRANDS LICENSED FROM THE COMPANY, AND WE ARE THEREFORE DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESSES OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES FOR THAT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE. A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS COULD INFLUENCE THE SUCCESS OF THOSE THIRD

PARTIES AND IF NEGATIVE FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF OUR LICENSEES, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE OBTAIN INSURANCE AGAINST THE RISK OF LOSSES RELATING TO SOME OF THESE

EVENTS, GENERALLY INCLUDING PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO OUR PROPERTY AND RESULTING BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, CERTAIN INJURIES OCCURRING ON OUR PROPERTY AND LIABILITY FOR ALLEGED BREACH OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WHEN INSURANCE IS OBTAINED IT IS SUBJECT TO

DEDUCTIBLES, EXCLUSIONS, TERMS, CONDITIONS AND LIMITS OF LIABILITY. THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF COVERAGE WE OBTAIN VARY FROM TIME TO TIME DEPENDING ON OUR VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SPECIFIC TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS IN RELATION TO THE COST OF OBTAINING

COVERAGE FOR SUCH TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS.

CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS OR

OTHERWISE AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OCCUR WE MAY NEED TO ADJUST

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES TO MEET THESE CHANGES OR WE MAY OTHERWISE FIND IT NECESSARY TO RESTRUCTURE OUR OPERATIONS OR PARTICULAR BUSINESSES OR ASSETS. IN ADDITION, EXTERNAL EVENTS INCLUDING ACCEPTANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL OFFERINGS AND CHANGES IN

MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS. WHEN THESE CHANGES OR EVENTS OCCUR, WE MAY INCUR COSTS TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND MAY NEED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF ASSETS. WE ALSO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING OR NEW

BUSINESSES, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS AND IN NEW BUSINESS LINES. IN RECENT YEARS, SUCH INVESTMENTS HAVE INCLUDED INVESTMENTS IN NEW CRUISE SHIPS, EXPANSION AND REPURPOSING OF CERTAIN OF OUR THEME PARK

ATTRACTIONS, AND DEVELOPMENT OF A RESORT FACILITY IN HAWAII. IN ADDITION, A JOINT VENTURE IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE RECENTLY BEGAN CONSTRUCTION OF A THEME PARK IN SHANGHAI, CHINA. SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS MAY HAVE SHORT-TERM RETURNS THAT ARE NEGATIVE

OR LOW AND THE ULTIMATE BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES MAY BE UNCERTAIN. IN ANY OF THESE EVENTS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE, WE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS OR RETURNS ON NEW INVESTMENTS MAY BE LOWER THAN

PRIOR TO THE CHANGE IN STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING.

TURMOIL IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND IMPEDE ACCESS

TO OR INCREASE THE COST OF FINANCING OUR OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS.

PAST DISRUPTIONS IN THE U.S. AND GLOBAL CREDIT AND

EQUITY MARKETS MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY BUSINESSES TO OBTAIN FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. THESE CONDITIONS TENDED TO INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING AND IF THEY RECUR, OUR COST OF BORROWING COULD INCREASE AND IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN

FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES THAT ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS

MEASURED BY CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. A DECREASE IN THESE RATINGS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING. PAST DISRUPTIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL

MARKETS ALSO IMPACTED SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. A SIMILAR DECLINE IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SECURE CREDIT-WORTHY COUNTERPARTIES FOR OUR INTEREST RATE AND

FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING PROGRAMS AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SETTLE EXISTING CONTRACTS.

COMPETITION IN EACH OF THESE AREAS MAY DIVERT CONSUMERS FROM OUR CREATIVE OR OTHER PRODUCTS, OR TO OTHER

PRODUCTS OR OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR MARKETING COSTS. SUCH COMPETITION MAY ALSO REDUCE, OR LIMIT GROWTH IN, PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING ADVERTISING RATES AND SUBSCRIPTION FEES

AT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS, PARKS AND RESORTS ADMISSIONS AND ROOM RATES, AND PRICES FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS FROM WHICH WE DERIVE LICENSE REVENUES. COMPETITION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF RESOURCES CAN INCREASE THE COST OF PRODUCING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

SUSTAINED INCREASES IN COSTS OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND OTHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR

PROFITABILITY.

WITH APPROXIMATELY 166,000 EMPLOYEES, OUR PROFITABILITY IS SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED BY COSTS OF PENSION

BENEFITS AND CURRENT AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. WE MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THESE COSTS AS A RESULT OF MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING INCREASES IN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE. IN ADDITION,

CHANGES IN INVESTMENT RETURNS AND DISCOUNT RATES USED TO CALCULATE PENSION EXPENSE AND RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE VOLATILE AND MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS IN SOME YEARS. THESE MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS AS WELL AS A DECLINE IN

THE FAIR VALUE OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ASSETS MAY PUT UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING PENSION AND POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS AND MAY INCREASE FUTURE FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL

INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE COULD REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF LONG-TERM PROGRAMMING OR CARRIAGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT RENEWED ON SUFFICIENTLY FAVORABLE TERMS.

WE ENTER INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR BOTH THE ACQUISITION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTS

FOR THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS FOR SPORTING EVENTS AND OTHER PROGRAMS, AND CONTRACTS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PROGRAMMING TO MVPDS. AS THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRE, WE MUST RENEW OR RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RENEW

THEM ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY LOSE PROGRAMMING RIGHTS OR DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS. EVEN IF THESE CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED, THE COST OF OBTAINING PROGRAMMING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE (OR INCREASE AT FASTER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE) OR THE REVENUE

FROM DISTRIBUTION OF PROGRAMS MAY BE REDUCED (OR INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE). WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, THE IMPACT OF THESE LONG-TERM

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTRACTS ON OUR RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER

AUDIENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT REVENUES FROM PROGRAMMING BASED ON THESE RIGHTS WILL EXCEED THE COST OF THE RIGHTS PLUS THE OTHER COSTS OF PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAMMING.

CHANGES IN REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES MAY IMPAIR THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BROADCAST NETWORKS AND TELEVISION STATIONS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED, AND EACH OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF U.S. AND

OVERSEAS REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATIONS INCLUDE.



U.S. FCC REGULATION OF OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO NETWORKS, OUR NATIONAL PROGRAMMING NETWORKS, AND OUR OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS. SEE ITEM 1 

BUSINESS  MEDIA NETWORKS, FEDERAL REGULATION.



ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION REGULATIONS.



FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS.



REGULATION OF THE SAFETY OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND THEME PARK OPERATIONS.



IMPOSITION BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES OF TRADE RESTRICTIONS, OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS OR MOTION PICTURE OR TELEVISION CONTENT

REQUIREMENTS OR QUOTAS.



DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TAX LAWS OR CURRENCY CONTROLS.

CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE REGULATIONS OR REGULATORY ACTIVITIES IN ANY OF THESE AREAS MAY REQUIRE US TO SPEND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS, OR MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OFFER PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES THAT ARE PROFITABLE.

OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OPERATION OF LAWS IN THOSE

JURISDICTIONS.

OUR OPERATIONS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS ARE IN MANY CASES SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN

WHICH THEY OPERATE RATHER THAN U.S. LAW. LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS DIFFER IN SIGNIFICANT RESPECTS FROM THOSE IN THE U.S., AND THESE DIFFERENCES CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REACT TO CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND OUR RIGHTS OR ABILITY TO ENFORCE RIGHTS

MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED UNDER U.S. LAW. MOREOVER, ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS IN SOME OVERSEAS JURISDICTIONS CAN BE INCONSISTENT AND UNPREDICTABLE, WHICH CAN AFFECT BOTH OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS AND TO UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES THAT WE

BELIEVE ARE BENEFICIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE AND OUR EXPENSES IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS MAY DIFFER FROM WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED IF U.S. LAW GOVERNED THESE OPERATIONS.

LABOR DISPUTES MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN VARIOUS OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF

OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS AS WELL AS WRITERS, DIRECTORS, ACTORS, PRODUCTION PERSONNEL AND OTHERS EMPLOYED IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS AND STUDIO OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE EMPLOYEES OF LICENSEES WHO MANUFACTURE AND RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER

PRODUCTS, AND EMPLOYEES OF PROVIDERS OF PROGRAMMING CONTENT (SUCH AS SPORTS LEAGUES) MAY BE COVERED BY LABOR AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS. IN GENERAL, A LABOR DISPUTE INVOLVING OUR EMPLOYEES OR THE EMPLOYEES OF OUR LICENSEES OR RETAILERS WHO SELL

OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR PROVIDERS OF PROGRAMMING CONTENT MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUES, AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS.

PROVISIONS IN OUR CORPORATE DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE STATE LAW COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL, EVEN IF THAT CHANGE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO SHAREHOLDERS.

OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION CONTAINS A PROVISION REGULATING THE ABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BRING MATTERS FOR ACTION BEFORE

ANNUAL AND SPECIAL MEETINGS AND AUTHORIZES OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE AND SET THE TERMS OF PREFERRED STOCK. THE REGULATIONS ON SHAREHOLDER ACTION COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ANY PERSON SEEKING TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN

SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF ACTIONS THAT WOULD SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD EFFECTIVELY DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF ANY PERSON SEEKING CONTROL OR OTHERWISE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN CONTROL. IN ADDITION, PROVISIONS IN

OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION REQUIRE SUPERMAJORITY SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF SOME ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, EITHER OF WHICH COULD HAVE THE EFFECT

OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE OF CONTROL IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SEASONALITY OF CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES COULD EXACERBATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES IS NORMALLY SUBJECT TO SEASONAL VARIATIONS, AS FOLLOWS.



REVENUES IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. IN GENERAL, ADVERTISING REVENUES

ARE SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS ARE MET.

THESE COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION DURING THIS PERIOD.



REVENUES IN OUR PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY RESULTING FROM THE SEASONAL NATURE OF

VACATION TRAVEL AND LOCAL ENTERTAINMENT EXCURSIONS. PEAK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY GENERALLY OCCUR DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN SCHOOL VACATIONS OCCUR AND DURING EARLY-WINTER AND SPRING-HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT, AND

TELEVISION MARKETS. RELEASE DATES ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF THEATRICAL

RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS.



REVENUES IN OUR INTERACTIVE SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF VIDEO GAME RELEASES WHICH ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING THEATRICAL RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS, COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF HOLIDAY PERIODS. REVENUES FROM CERTAIN OF OUR INTERNET AND MOBILE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR SEASONAL TRENDS.

ACCORDINGLY, IF A SHORT TERM NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OCCURS DURING A TIME OF HIGH SEASONAL DEMAND (SUCH AS HURRICANE DAMAGE TO

OUR PARKS DURING THE SUMMER TRAVEL SEASON), THE EFFECT COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF THAT BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR.

THE COMPANYS PENDING ACQUISITION OF LUCASFILM IS EXPECTED TO CAUSE SHORT TERM DILUTION IN EARNINGS PER SHARE AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT

ANTICIPATED IMPROVEMENTS IN EARNINGS PER SHARE WILL BE REALIZED.

ON OCTOBER 30, 2012, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN

AGREEMENT TO ACQUIRE LUCASFILM LTD. IN A MERGER TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS EXPECTED TO DISTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY 40 MILLION SHARES AND PAY APPROXIMATELY $2.025 BILLION IN CASH. WE EXPECT THAT THE MERGER WILL INITIALLY RESULT IN LOWER

EARNINGS PER SHARE THAN WE WOULD HAVE EARNED IN THE ABSENCE OF THE MERGER. WE EXPECT THAT OVER TIME THE MERGER WILL YIELD BENEFITS TO THE COMBINED COMPANY SUCH THAT THE MERGER WILL ULTIMATELY BE ACCRETIVE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE

NO ASSURANCE THAT THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS PER SHARE EXPECTED IN THE LONG TERM WILL BE ACHIEVED. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE INCREASES IN EARNINGS PER SHARE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL, AMONG OTHER THINGS, NEED TO EFFECTIVELY

CONTINUE THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS OF LUCASFILM AFTER THE MERGER, DEVELOP SUCCESSFUL NEW CONTENT (INCLUDING FUTURE FEATURE FILMS) BASED ON LUCASFILMS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE LUCASFILMS PRODUCTS INTO THE COMBINED

COMPANYS VARIOUS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

CELADOR INTERNATIONAL LTD. V. AMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANIES, INC.

ON MAY 19, 2004, AN AFFILIATE OF THE CREATOR AND

LICENSOR OF THE TELEVISION PROGRAM,

WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE,

FILED AN ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES, INCLUDING AMERICAN BROADCASTING COMPANIES, INC. AND BUENA VISTA TELEVISION, LLC, ALLEGING IT

WAS DAMAGED BY DEFENDANTS IMPROPERLY ENGAGING IN CERTAIN INTRA-COMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND CHARGING MERCHANDISE DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES, RESULTING IN AN UNDERPAYMENT TO THE PLAINTIFF. ON JULY 7, 2010, THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT FOR BREACH OF

CONTRACT AGAINST CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY, AWARDING PLAINTIFF DAMAGES OF $269.4 MILLION. THE COMPANY HAS STIPULATED WITH THE PLAINTIFF TO AN AWARD OF PREJUDGMENT INTEREST OF $50 MILLION, WHICH AMOUNT WILL BE REDUCED PRO RATA

SHOULD THE COURT OF APPEALS REDUCE THE DAMAGES AMOUNT. ON DECEMBER 21, 2010, THE COMPANYS ALTERNATIVE MOTIONS FOR A NEW TRIAL AND FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW WERE DENIED. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THIS

LAWSUIT, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE JURYS VERDICT IS IN ERROR AND IS VIGOROUSLY PURSUING ITS POSITION ON APPEAL, NOTICE OF WHICH WAS FILED BY THE COMPANY ON JANUARY 14, 2011. ON OR ABOUT JANUARY 28, 2011, PLAINTIFF FILED A NOTICE OF

CROSS-APPEAL. ON OCTOBER 10, 2012, ORAL ARGUMENT ON THE APPEALS WAS HELD. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT IT DOES NOT HAVE A PROBABLE LOSS UNDER THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARD RELATING TO PROBABILITY OF LOSS FOR RECORDING A RESERVE WITH

RESPECT TO THIS LITIGATION AND THEREFORE HAS NOT RECORDED A RESERVE.

ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2012, PLAINTIFFS FILED AN ACTION IN SOUTH DAKOTA STATE COURT AGAINST CERTAIN SUBSIDIARIES AND EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY AND OTHERS, ASSERTING CLAIMS FOR DEFAMATION ARISING FROM ALLEGED FALSE STATEMENTS AND

IMPLICATIONS, STATUTORY AND COMMON LAW PRODUCT DISPARAGEMENT, AND TORTIOUS INTERFERENCE WITH EXISTING AND PROSPECTIVE BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS. THE CLAIMS ARISE OUT OF ABC NEWS REPORTS PUBLISHED IN MARCH AND APRIL 2012 THAT DISCUSSED THE SUBJECT OF

LABELING REQUIREMENTS FOR PRODUCTION PROCESSES RELATED TO A PRODUCT ONE PLAINTIFF PRODUCES THAT IS ADDED TO GROUND BEEF BEFORE SALE TO CONSUMERS. PLAINTIFFS SEEK ACTUAL AND CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $400 MILLION, STATUTORY DAMAGES

(INCLUDING TREBLE DAMAGES) PURSUANT TO SOUTH DAKOTAS AGRICULTURAL FOOD PRODUCTS DISPARAGEMENT ACT, AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. ON OCTOBER 24, 2012, THE COMPANY REMOVED THE ACTION TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF SOUTH

DAKOTA, AND ON OCTOBER 31, 2012, THE COMPANY MOVED TO DISMISS ALL CLAIMS.

THE COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES,

CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR CODEFENDANT IN VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS INVOLVING COPYRIGHT, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE COMPANY TO

REVENUES

AFFILIATE FEE GROWTH OF 6% WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES OF 5% FROM HIGHER CONTRACTUAL RATES AND 1% FROM SUBSCRIBER GROWTH AT CABLE NETWORKS.

HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUES WERE DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $263 MILLION AT CABLE NETWORKS FROM $3,522 MILLION TO $3,785 MILLION, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $162 MILLION AT BROADCASTING FROM $4,076 MILLION TO $3,914 MILLION. THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS REFLECTED AN INCREASE OF 6% DUE TO HIGHER RATES. THE DECREASE AT BROADCASTING REFLECTED DECREASES OF 7% DUE TO LOWER ABC

RATINGS, AND 2% DUE TO LOWER LOCAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING DRIVEN BY LOWER POLITICAL ADVERTISING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF 5% DUE TO HIGHER ABC ADVERTISING RATES.

THE INCREASE IN OTHER REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROGRAM SALES DRIVEN BY

CASTLE, ONCE UPON A TIME,

AND

REVENGE

, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER HOME ENTERTAINMENT REVENUES, PRIMARILY DUE

TO

LOST

, AND LOWER DISNEY CHANNEL PROGRAM SALES.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS WHICH INCREASED $231 MILLION FROM $8,760 MILLION TO $8,991 MILLION. AT CABLE

NETWORKS, AN INCREASE IN PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS OF $359 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SPORTS RIGHTS COSTS DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES FOR COLLEGE SPORTS, NFL, MLB, AND NBA PROGRAMMING AND EXPANDED RIGHTS FOR THE WIMBLEDON

CHAMPIONSHIPS. AT BROADCASTING, PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS DECREASED $128 MILLION REFLECTING THE ABSENCE OF

THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW

AT OUR LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS AND LOWER PROGRAM WRITE-OFFS AT ABC.

EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES

INCOME FROM EQUITY INVESTEES INCREASED TO $627 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR FROM $584 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE AT AETN PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ADVERTISING AND AFFILIATE REVENUES,

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

PARKS AND RESORTS REVENUES INCREASED 10%, OR $1.1 BILLION, TO $12.9 BILLION DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $1.0 BILLION AT OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND AN INCREASE OF $86 MILLION AT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

REVENUE GROWTH OF 11% AT OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS REFLECTED A 5% INCREASE FROM HIGHER AVERAGE GUEST SPENDING AND A 5% INCREASE

FROM VOLUME. INCREASED GUEST SPENDING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE TICKET PRICES, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SPENDING, AND DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATES. THE VOLUME INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER PASSENGER CRUISE DAYS FROM THE

DISNEY FANTASY

AND THE

DISNEY DREAM

, WHICH LAUNCHED IN MARCH 2012 AND JANUARY 2011, RESPECTIVELY, INCREASED ATTENDANCE AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS REFLECTING STRONG GROWTH AT DISNEYLAND RESORT WHICH BENEFITED FROM THE OPENING OF

CARS LAND

AT DISNEY CALIFORNIA

ADVENTURE AND HIGHER HOTEL OCCUPANCY FROM AULANI, OUR NEW HOTEL AND VACATION CLUB RESORT IN HAWAII, WHICH OPENED IN AUGUST 2011.

REVENUE GROWTH OF 3% AT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS REFLECTED A 3% INCREASE FROM HIGHER AVERAGE GUEST SPENDING, A 3% INCREASE FROM HIGHER ATTENDANCE AND A 3% INCREASE FROM HIGHER ROYALTY REVENUE FROM

TOKYO DISNEY RESORT. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF 4% FROM THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO AND A DECREASE OF 1% FROM LOWER HOTEL OCCUPANCY

AT DISNEYLAND PARIS. HIGHER GUEST SPENDING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATES AND AVERAGE TICKET PRICES. HIGHER ROYALTY REVENUE FROM TOKYO DISNEY RESORT REFLECTED THE PRIOR-YEAR IMPACT FROM THE EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN JAPAN.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE OPERATING LABOR WHICH INCREASED BY $285 MILLION FROM $3,540 MILLION TO $3,825 MILLION AND COST

OF SALES WHICH INCREASED $96 MILLION FROM $1,198 MILLION TO $1,294 MILLION. HIGHER OPERATING LABOR WAS DRIVEN BY NEW GUEST OFFERINGS, LABOR COST INFLATION AND HIGHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS. THE INCREASE IN COST OF SALES WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER VOLUMES.

OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED DUE TO COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RESORT EXPANSION AND NEW GUEST OFFERINGS INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN SUPPORTING SYSTEMS INFRASTRUCTURE. NEW GUEST OFFERINGS INCLUDED THE

DISNEY FANTASY

AND

DISNEY DREAM,

AND

THE EXPANSION OF DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE AT DISNEYLAND RESORT. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO AND THE COLLECTION OF

BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE PROCEEDS RELATED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN JAPAN.

THE INCREASE IN SELLING,

GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS WAS DRIVEN BY MARKETING FOR RESORT EXPANSION AND NEW GUEST OFFERINGS AND LABOR AND OTHER COST INFLATION.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 22%, OR $349

MILLION, TO $1.9 BILLION DRIVEN BY INCREASES AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS, TOKYO DISNEY RESORT, DISNEY CRUISE LINE AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE AT DISNEYLAND PARIS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REVENUES

LOWER THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION REVENUES WERE DRIVEN BY FEWER RELEASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF MARVELS

THE AVENGERS.

LOWER HOME ENTERTAINMENT REVENUE REFLECTED A 12% DECREASE FROM A DECLINE IN UNIT SALES REFLECTING LOWER CATALOG SALES AND THE PERFORMANCE

OF THE CURRENT-YEAR TITLES. SIGNIFICANT TITLES IN THE CURRENT YEAR INCLUDED MARVELS

THE AVENGERS

AND

CARS 2

WHILE THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED

TOY STORY 3

AND

TANGLED.

THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 2% INCREASE

DUE TO HIGHER NET EFFECTIVE PRICING DOMESTICALLY WHICH BENEFITTED FROM A HIGHER BLU-RAY SALES MIX. NET EFFECTIVE PRICING IS THE WHOLESALE SELLING PRICE ADJUSTED FOR DISCOUNTS, SALES INCENTIVES AND RETURNS.

THE DECREASE IN TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER REVENUE SHARE FROM THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT RESULTING

FROM THE PRIOR-YEAR PERFORMANCE OF CARS MERCHANDISE. TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION REVENUE WAS COMPARABLE TO THE PRIOR YEAR AS HIGHER SYNDICATION SALES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WAS OFFSET BY LOWER SALES IN THE DOMESTIC PAY TELEVISION MARKET.

COST AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED A DECREASE OF $200 MILLION IN FILM COST AMORTIZATION, FROM $1,885 MILLION TO $1,685 MILLION, DRIVEN BY LOWER

HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES VOLUME AND A LOWER AVERAGE PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION RATE FOR TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FILM COST WRITE-DOWNS. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND COST OF GOODS SOLD

WHICH DECREASED $145 MILLION FROM $1,368 MILLION TO $1,223 MILLION DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES VOLUME AND FEWER THEATRICAL TITLES IN RELEASE.

THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MARKETING EXPENSES AT OUR THEATRICAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES DRIVEN BY FEWER MAJOR RELEASES IN THE

CURRENT YEAR.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 17% TO $722 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED RESULTS AT OUR DOMESTIC THEATRICAL AND TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FILM COST WRITE-DOWNS

IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

THE COMPANY RECORDED CHARGES OF $18 MILLION, $33 MILLION AND $151 MILLION RELATED TO STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT FOR FISCAL YEARS 2012, 2011 AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE CHARGES IN FISCAL 2012 WERE PRIMARILY DUE

TO AN IMPAIRMENT OF AN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INTANGIBLE ASSET. THE CHARGES IN FISCAL 2011 WERE PRIMARILY FOR SEVERANCE AND RELATED COSTS. THE CHARGES IN FISCAL 2010 WERE PRIMARILY FOR THE CLOSURE OF A PRODUCTION FACILITY, THE WRITE-OFFS OF

THE 7% INCREASE IN RETAIL AND OTHER REVENUE REFLECTED GROWTH AT OUR RETAIL BUSINESS DRIVEN

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED AN INCREASE OF $26 MILLION IN COST OF GOODS SOLD, FROM $567 MILLION TO $593 MILLION, DRIVEN BY INCREASED SALES

VOLUME AT OUR RETAIL BUSINESS. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED 1% DUE TO HIGHER DISTRIBUTION COSTS DRIVEN BY HIGHER THIRD-PARTY ROYALTIES AND 1% DUE TO HIGHER LABOR AND OCCUPANCY COSTS DRIVEN BY THE EXPANSION OF THE DISNEY ENGLISH BUSINESS IN

CHINA AND NEW RETAIL STORES IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE.

THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER EXPENSES

REVENUES

THE DECREASE IN GAME SALES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUE REFLECTED A 29% DECREASE FROM LOWER CONSOLE GAME UNIT SALES AND A 8% DECREASE FROM LOWER NET EFFECTIVE PRICING OF CONSOLE GAMES REFLECTING THE STRONG

PERFORMANCE OF

LEGO PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN

,

CARS 2

AND

EPIC MICKEY

IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN 11% INCREASE FROM HIGHER SOCIAL GAMES REVENUE REFLECTING IMPROVED TITLE PERFORMANCE IN THE

CURRENT PERIOD AND LOWER ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING IMPACTS.

HIGHER ADVERTISING AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE AT

OUR MOBILE PHONE SERVICE IN JAPAN WHICH INCLUDED A BENEFIT FROM HIGHER RATES.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED A $21 MILLION DECREASE IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS FROM $352 MILLION TO $331 MILLION DRIVEN BY DECREASED

CONSOLE GAME DEVELOPMENT. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE COST OF SALES, WHICH DECREASED BY $71 MILLION FROM $323 MILLION TO $252 MILLION DRIVEN BY LOWER CONSOLE GAME SALES VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE AT SOCIAL GAMES ASSOCIATED WITH

REVENUE GROWTH.

THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MARKETING COSTS

AT OUR CONSOLE GAMES BUSINESS DRIVEN BY FEWER RELEASES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, LOWER ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING EXPENSES AT OUR SOCIAL GAMES BUSINESS, AND HIGHER COST ALLOCATIONS TO OTHER COMPANY BUSINESSES RELATED TO WEBSITE DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE AND

ONLINE REVENUES.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED 1.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR THE YEAR DUE TO THE IMPACT IN THE PRIOR-YEAR

OF THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF MIRAMAX AND AN INCREASE IN EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN OPERATIONS SUBJECT TO TAX AT RATES LOWER THAN THE FEDERAL STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE. THE BOOK VALUE OF MIRAMAX INCLUDED NON-DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL SUCH THAT THE TAXABLE

GAIN ON THE SALE OF MIRAMAX RESULTED IN TAX EXPENSE THAT EXCEEDED THE BOOK GAIN CAUSING AN INCREASE IN THE PRIOR-YEAR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE DECREASES FROM THE IMPACTS OF THE MIRAMAX GAIN AND FOREIGN EARNINGS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE

DUE TO THE TAX RATE BENEFIT IN THE PRIOR-YEAR RELATED TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. THE PRIOR-YEAR IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO ASSETS THAT HAD TAX BASIS IN EXCESS OF THE BOOK VALUE RESULTING IN A TAX BENEFIT THAT EXCEEDED THE PRE-TAX IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE CAUSING A DECREASE IN THE PRIOR-YEAR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS FOR THE YEAR INCREASED $40 MILLION TO $491 MILLION DUE TO IMPROVED OPERATING RESULTS

AT ESPN AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER OPERATING RESULTS AT DISNEYLAND PARIS INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE DLP DEBT CHARGE. THE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IS DETERMINED ON INCOME AFTER ROYALTIES,

FINANCING COSTS AND INCOME TAXES.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN COSTS AFFECT RESULTS IN ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS, WITH APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THESE COSTS

BEING BORNE BY THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSES OF $626 MILLION, $576 MILLION, AND $482 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2012, 2011, AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL

2012 WAS DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OBLIGATIONS. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED

FROM A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

IN FISCAL 2013, WE EXPECT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $66 MILLION TO $692 MILLION, INCLUDING $458 MILLION OF RECOGNITION OF NET ACTUARIAL LOSSES, DRIVEN BY A

LOWER ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS FOR FISCAL 2012 INCLUDED $340 MILLION OF NET ACTUARIAL LOSSES. THE DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE ALSO RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN THE UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF OUR PLANS TO $4.8

BILLION AND AN INCREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE TO $5.1 BILLION ($3.2 BILLION AFTER TAX) AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012. IF OUR FUTURE INVESTMENT RETURNS DO NOT EXCEED OUR LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURNS AND/OR DISCOUNT

RATES DO NOT INCREASE, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE UNRECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS A NET ACTUARIAL LOSS IN OUR INCOME STATEMENT OVER APPROXIMATELY THE NEXT 8 YEARS. SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF THE IMPACTS OF OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. DURING FISCAL 2012, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $905 MILLION TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS INCLUDING

DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS IN FISCAL 2013 TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $425 MILLION TO $475 MILLION. FINAL MINIMUM

FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR FISCAL 2013 WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON OUR JANUARY 1, 2013 FUNDING ACTUARIAL VALUATION WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE IN LATE FISCAL 2013. SEE ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS FOR THE IMPACT OF FACTORS AFFECTING

INCREASE OF 1% FROM BROADCASTING DUE TO NEW CONTRACTUAL PROVISIONS.

HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUES WERE DUE TO AN INCREASE OF

$471 MILLION AT CABLE NETWORKS FROM $3,051 MILLION TO $3,522 MILLION AND AN INCREASE OF $99 MILLION AT BROADCASTING FROM $3,977 MILLION TO $4,076 MILLION. THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS OF 14% WAS DUE TO HIGHER RATES. THE INCREASE AT BROADCASTING

REFLECTED INCREASES OF 6% DUE TO HIGHER ABC ADVERTISING RATES, PRIMARILY IN PRIMETIME, AND 1% DUE TO HIGHER LOCAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF 4% DUE TO LOWER ABC RATINGS PRIMARILY IN PRIMETIME AND DAYTIME.

THE INCREASE IN OTHER REVENUES WAS DRIVEN BY A CHANGE IN THE TRANSFER PRICING ARRANGEMENT BETWEEN STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT AND MEDIA NETWORKS

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS WHICH INCREASED $211 MILLION FROM $8,549 MILLION TO $8,760 MILLION. AT CABLE NETWORKS, AN INCREASE IN PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION SPENDING OF

PROGRAMMING AND MORE EPISODES OF ORIGINAL PROGRAMMING AT THE DISNEY CHANNELS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR THE FIFA WORLD CUP WHICH WAS BROADCAST IN FISCAL 2010. AT BROADCASTING, PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS DECREASED

$208 MILLION REFLECTING LOWER NEWS AND DAYTIME PRODUCTION COSTS DUE TO COST SAVINGS INITIATIVES, A LOWER COST MIX OF PROGRAMMING IN PRIMETIME DUE TO A SHIFT OF HOURS FROM ORIGINAL SCRIPTED PROGRAMMING TO REALITY PROGRAMMING, A SHIFT OF COLLEGE

SPORTS PROGRAMMING TO ESPN AND LOWER PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION DUE TO A DECREASE IN SALES OF ABC STUDIOS PRODUCTIONS. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED BY 2% DUE TO A CHANGE IN THE TRANSFER PRICING ARRANGEMENT FOR DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA

NETWORKS HOME ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCT AND INCREASED BY 1% RESULTING FROM HEADCOUNT GROWTH AND LABOR COST INFLATION AT ESPN.

THE

INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER MARKETING AND SALES COSTS, WHICH INCLUDED AN INCREASE DUE TO THE CHANGE IN TRANSFER PRICING ARRANGEMENT FOR DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA NETWORKS HOME

ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCT AND HIGHER MARKETING COSTS AT ESPN.

EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES

INCOME FROM EQUITY INVESTEES INCREASED TO $584 MILLION IN FISCAL 2011 FROM $438 MILLION IN FISCAL 2010 DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE AT AETN

INCREASE DUE TO VOLUME DRIVEN BY HIGHER PASSENGER CRUISE DAYS AS A RESULT OF THE LAUNCH OF THE

DISNEY DREAM

AGAINST THE EURO.

THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS AND EXPENSES WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER

MARKETING COSTS AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADDITION OF THE

LOWER HOME ENTERTAINMENT REVENUE

REFLECTED AN 11% DECREASE DUE TO THE CHANGE IN THE TRANSFER PRICING ARRANGEMENT FOR STUDIO DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA NETWORKS HOME ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 1% INCREASE DUE TO HIGHER NET EFFECTIVE PRICING INTERNATIONALLY WHICH

BENEFITTED FROM A HIGHER BLU-RAY SALES MIX. NET EFFECTIVE PRICING IS THE WHOLESALE SELLING PRICE ADJUSTED FOR DISCOUNTS, SALES INCENTIVES AND RETURNS.

THE INCREASE IN TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER REVENUES REFLECTED 5% GROWTH DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF MARVEL WHICH WAS ACQUIRED AT THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010 AND A 4% INCREASE DUE TO

HIGHER REVENUE SHARE FROM THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT RESULTING FROM THE STRENGTH OF CARS MERCHANDISE.

COST AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED A DECREASE OF $257 MILLION IN FILM COST AMORTIZATION, FROM $2,142 MILLION TO $1,885 MILLION, DRIVEN BY LOWER

2010. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 5% DECREASE DUE TO A HIGHER REVENUE SHARE TO THE STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT RESULTING FROM THE STRENGTH OF CARS MERCHANDISE.

THE INCREASE IN RETAIL AND OTHER REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A 9% INCREASE FROM HIGHER REVENUES AT THE DISNEY STORE IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE DRIVEN BY HIGHER COMPARABLE STORE SALES AND A 6% INCREASE

RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF THE DISNEY STORE JAPAN, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED AT THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010.

LICENSING AND PUBLISHING AND RETAIL AND OTHER REVENUES ALSO INCREASED BY 2% AND 3%, RESPECTIVELY, DUE TO THE BENEFIT FROM A FAVORABLE

IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED AN INCREASE OF $57 MILLION IN COST OF GOODS SOLD, FROM $521 MILLION TO $578 MILLION, DRIVEN BY THE

TO AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO.

THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS WAS DRIVEN BY AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE WEAKENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST FOREIGN

CURRENCIES, PRIMARILY THE EURO, THE INCLUSION OF A FULL YEAR OF OPERATIONS FOR MARVEL AND VARIOUS PROMOTIONAL INITIATIVES ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES.

THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS DUE TO A FULL YEAR OF AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR MARVEL AND AN INCREASE AT THE DISNEY STORES DUE TO NEW STORES AND REMODELS.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 21%, OR $139 MILLION, TO $816 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN OUR MERCHANDISE LICENSING AND NORTH

INCREASE IN GAME SALES AND SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES.

HIGHER ADVERTISING AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY OUR MOBILE PHONE SERVICE

IN JAPAN.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSE INCLUDED A $44 MILLION INCREASE IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE FROM $308 MILLION TO $352 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF PLAYDOM FOR A FULL YEAR. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO

INCLUDED A 14% INCREASE DUE TO HIGHER COST OF SALES DRIVEN BY FEES PAID TO THE DEVELOPER OF

LEGO PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN

AND HIGHER CONSOLE GAME UNIT SALES.

THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCLUSION OF PLAYDOM FOR A FULL YEAR, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING.

SEGMENT OPERATING LOSS

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED 0.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR THE YEAR AS A PRIOR YEAR CHARGE RELATED TO

HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION AND A CURRENT YEAR BENEFIT FROM AN INCREASE IN THE DOMESTIC PRODUCTION DEDUCTION RATE WERE LARGELY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN FAVORABLE RESOLUTIONS OF PRIOR-YEAR TAX MATTERS. DURING FISCAL 2010, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $72

MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE ENACTMENT OF HEALTH CARE REFORM LEGISLATION IN MARCH 2010. UNDER THIS LEGISLATION THE COMPANYS DEDUCTIONS FOR RETIREE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS WILL GENERALLY BE REDUCED BY THE AMOUNT OF MEDICARE PART D DRUG

SUBSIDIES RECEIVED BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR 2014. UNDER APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING RULES, THE COMPANY WAS REQUIRED TO REDUCE ITS EXISTING DEFERRED TAX ASSET, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED FOR THE FUTURE DEDUCTIBILITY OF RETIREE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT COSTS,

TO REFLECT THE LOST DEDUCTIONS. THE REDUCTION WAS RECORDED AS A CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD THE LEGISLATION WAS ENACTED.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS FOR THE YEAR INCREASED $101 MILLION TO $451 MILLION DUE TO IMPROVED OPERATING RESULTS

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2012 INCREASED 14% OR $1.0 BILLION TO $8.0 BILLION AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2011. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET OPERATING CASH RECEIPTS DRIVEN

BY HIGHER REVENUES AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS, MEDIA NETWORKS AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS BUSINESSES AND LOWER OPERATING CASH PAYMENTS AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT DRIVEN BY LOWER COST OF GOODS SOLD AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS. THESE CASH FLOW INCREASES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING CASH PAYMENTS AT PARKS AND RESORTS, LOWER REVENUES AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT AND HIGHER INTEREST AND INCOME TAX PAYMENTS. THE INCREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT PARKS AND RESORTS WAS DRIVEN BY LABOR COST INFLATION AND

COSTS FOR RESORT EXPANSION AND NEW GUEST OFFERINGS. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST PAYMENTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PAYMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED INTEREST ON DISNEYLAND PARIS BORROWINGS.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2011 INCREASED 6% OR $416 MILLION TO $7.0 BILLION AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010. THE

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER OPERATING CASH RECEIPTS DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUES AT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS, PARKS AND RESORTS, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND INTERACTIVE BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUES AT OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CASH PAYMENTS AT CORPORATE AND AT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS, PARKS AND RESORTS, INTERACTIVE, AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT

BUSINESS. THE INCREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT CORPORATE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLANS, WHILE THE INCREASE AT MEDIA NETWORKS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INVESTMENT IN TELEVISION PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION. THE INCREASE IN CASH

PAYMENTS AT PARKS AND RESORTS WAS DRIVEN BY LABOR COST INFLATION, HIGHER PROMOTIONAL AND OPERATING COSTS FROM THE JANUARY 2011 LAUNCH OF OUR NEW CRUISE SHIP, THE

DISNEY DREAM

, AND HIGHER MARKETING AND SALES EXPENSES AND EXPANSION COSTS FOR

DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE AT DISNEYLAND RESORT. THE INCREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT INTERACTIVE REFLECTS THE INCLUSION OF PLAYDOM, WHILE THE INCREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT CONSUMER PRODUCTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITIONS OF THE DISNEY STORE

JAPAN AND MARVEL. THE DECREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER FILM PRODUCTION SPENDING.

WAS DRIVEN BY RESORT EXPANSION AND NEW GUEST OFFERINGS AT WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS AT SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED EXPENDITURES AT DISNEYLAND RESORT. THE INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS IN FISCAL 2011 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2010 REFLECTED THE FINAL PAYMENT ON OUR NEW CRUISE SHIP, THE

OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES

DURING FISCAL 2012, ACQUISITIONS TOTALED $1.0 BILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ACQUISITION OF AN INCREMENTAL 43% INTEREST IN UTV AND A 49% INTEREST IN SEVEN TV NETWORK IN RUSSIA. WE ALSO MADE A $300 MILLION

EQUITY CONTRIBUTION TO AETN.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $0.2 BILLION COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF $1.7 BILLION IN REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $1.2 BILLION LESS NET BORROWINGS AND $0.1 BILLION LOWER

PROCEEDS FROM STOCK OPTIONS.

CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES IN FISCAL 2011 WAS $3.2 BILLION COMPARED TO $2.7 BILLION IN

FISCAL 2010. THE NET USE OF CASH IN FISCAL 2011 WAS DRIVEN BY REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TOTALING $5.7 BILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY NET BORROWINGS OF $1.6 BILLION AND PROCEEDS FROM EXERCISES OF STOCK OPTIONS OF $1.1 BILLION.

IN JUNE 2012, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW FIVE-YEAR $2.25 BILLION BANK FACILITY WITH A SYNDICATE OF

LENDERS WHICH EXPIRES 2017. THIS FACILITY REPLACED AN EXISTING THREE-YEAR $2.25 BILLION FACILITY WHICH WAS SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN 2013, AND IN COMBINATION WITH THE EXISTING $2.25 BILLION FACILITY THAT MATURES IN 2015, IS USED TO SUPPORT COMMERCIAL

PAPER BORROWINGS. THESE BANK FACILITIES ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS AT LIBOR-BASED RATES PLUS A SPREAD, WHICH DEPENDS ON THE COMPANYS PUBLIC DEBT RATING AND CAN RANGE FROM 0.26% TO 1.93%. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO ISSUE UP TO $800 MILLION

OF LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE FACILITY EXPIRING IN FEBRUARY 2015, WHICH IF UTILIZED, REDUCES AVAILABLE BORROWINGS UNDER THIS FACILITY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, $258 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT HAD BEEN ISSUED OF WHICH NONE WERE ISSUED UNDER

THIS FACILITY.

THE COMPANY MAY USE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS UP TO THE AMOUNT OF ITS UNUSED BANK FACILITIES, IN CONJUNCTION

WITH TERM DEBT ISSUANCE AND OPERATING CASH FLOW, TO RETIRE OR REFINANCE OTHER BORROWINGS BEFORE OR AS THEY COME DUE.

THE

COMPANY PAID A $0.60 PER SHARE DIVIDEND ($1.1 BILLION) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2012 RELATED TO FISCAL 2011. THE COMPANY PAID A $0.40 PER SHARE DIVIDEND ($756 MILLION) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2011 RELATED TO FISCAL 2010, AND

PAID A $0.35 PER SHARE DIVIDEND ($653 MILLION) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2010 RELATED TO FISCAL 2009. AS OF THE FILING DATE OF THIS REPORT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD NOT YET DECLARED A DIVIDEND RELATED TO FISCAL 2012.

DURING FISCAL 2012, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 72 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $3.0 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2011, THE

COMPANY REPURCHASED 135 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $5.0 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2010, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 80 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $2.7 BILLION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD REMAINING

AUTHORIZATION IN PLACE TO REPURCHASE 232 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH BALANCES, OTHER LIQUID ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAN BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL.

SEE ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS. IN ADDITION TO MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE COMPANYS BORROWING COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART,

ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CERTAIN CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A2 AND

P-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK; STANDARD & POORS LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A AND A-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK; AND FITCHS LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A

AND F-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK. THE COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT, RELATING TO INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE COMPANY MET ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. THE COMPANYS BANK

FACILITIES ALSO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE CERTAIN ENTITIES, SUCH AS DISNEYLAND PARIS, HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT AND SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT, FROM ANY REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

IN SEPTEMBER 2012, THE COMPANY PROVIDED 1.3 BILLION OF FINANCING TO ED WHICH ED USED TO REPAY ITS OUTSTANDING THIRD-PARTY BANK

DEBT. THE REPAYMENT ELIMINATED CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND OPERATING COVENANTS, NOTABLY THOSE RELATED TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURE LIMITATIONS AND THE PAYMENT OF ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES DUE TO THE COMPANY. THERE WAS NO NET INCREASE IN CONSOLIDATED

BORROWINGS FOR THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE REFINANCING.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS WHICH ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. OTHER ITEMS, SUCH AS CERTAIN PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND OTHER EXECUTORY CONTRACTS ARE NOT RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT ARE REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN THE FOOTNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR

CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT THESE ARRANGEMENTS WILL RESULT IN ANY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS BEING PAID BY THE COMPANY.

SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE

COMPANYS CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL GUARANTEES.

LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS

AS DISCLOSED IN NOTES 9 AND 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR CERTAIN LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF

MANAGEMENT. FOR A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND COSTS

WE EXPENSE FILM AND TELEVISION

PRODUCTION, PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS REVENUES TO THE ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FOR EACH PRODUCTION. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF

ULTIMATE REVENUES DECREASES, AMORTIZATION OF FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED. CONVERSELY, IF OUR ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES INCREASE, FILM AND TELEVISION COST AMORTIZATION MAY BE SLOWED. FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ULTIMATE REVENUES

INCLUDE REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION SERIES, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE FIRST

EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER.

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WITH RESPECT TO FILMS INTENDED FOR THEATRICAL RELEASE, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING

OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES (AND THEREFORE AFFECTING FUTURE FILM COST AMORTIZATION AND/OR IMPAIRMENT) IS DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. REVENUES DERIVED FROM OTHER MARKETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE DOMESTIC THEATRICAL RELEASE (E.G., THE HOME

ENTERTAINMENT OR INTERNATIONAL THEATRICAL MARKETS) HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE VARIES PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND DEMAND FOR A PARTICULAR FILM, THE

POPULARITY OF COMPETING FILMS AT THE TIME OF RELEASE AND THE LEVEL OF MARKETING EFFORT. UPON A FILMS RELEASE AND DETERMINATION OF DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF REVENUES FROM SUCCEEDING WINDOWS AND MARKETS ARE

REVISED BASED ON HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND AN ANALYSIS OF CURRENT MARKET TRENDS. THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR RELEASED FILMS IS THE EXTENT OF HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES ACHIEVED. HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES

VARY BASED ON THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF COMPETING HOME VIDEO PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE MANNER IN WHICH RETAILERS MARKET AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO TELEVISION SERIES OR OTHER TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS INTENDED FOR BROADCAST, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES IS THE PROGRAMS RATING AND THE STRENGTH

OF THE ADVERTISING MARKET. PROGRAM RATINGS, WHICH ARE AN INDICATION OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, DIRECTLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE ADVERTISING REVENUES DURING THE AIRING OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, TELEVISION SERIES WITH GREATER

MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUES THROUGH THE EVENTUAL SALE OF THE PROGRAM RIGHTS IN THE SYNDICATION, INTERNATIONAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKETS. ALTERNATIVELY, POOR RATINGS MAY RESULT IN A TELEVISION SERIES

CANCELLATION, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE IMMEDIATE WRITE-OFF OF ANY UNAMORTIZED PRODUCTION COSTS. A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE ADVERTISING MARKET WOULD ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ESTIMATES.

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE

PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. AMORTIZATION OF THOSE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ASSETS BEING AMORTIZED ON A NUMBER OF AIRINGS BASIS MAY BE ACCELERATED IF WE REDUCE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE

AIRINGS AND SLOWED IF WE INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS. THE NUMBER OF FUTURE AIRINGS OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY THE PROGRAMS RATINGS IN PREVIOUS AIRINGS, EXPECTED ADVERTISING RATES AND AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF

ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMMING. ACCORDINGLY, PLANNED USAGE IS REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND REVISED IF NECESSARY. WE AMORTIZE RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASONS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE OF

EACH YEAR IN THE ARRANGEMENT. THE ESTIMATED VALUES OF EACH YEAR ARE BASED ON OUR PROJECTION OF REVENUES OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD WHICH INCLUDE ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE REVENUE. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO

EACH SEASON APPROXIMATE EACH SEASONS RELATIVE VALUE, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. IF PLANNED USAGE PATTERNS OR ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUES BY YEAR WERE TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY, AMORTIZATION OF OUR

SPORTS RIGHTS COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED OR SLOWED.

COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR

RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS WHICH COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WITH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN

AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE: PRIMETIME, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, NEWS, AND SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE

PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN-OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM. ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET

CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR PROJECTIONS, FILM, TELEVISION AND PROGRAMMING COST WRITE-DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ITS

VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH BUSINESS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THESE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES.

WE REDUCE HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND SOFTWARE PRODUCT REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED FUTURE RETURNS OF MERCHANDISE AND FOR CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND

SALES INCENTIVES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL RETURN EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS IN A PARTICULAR

PERIOD, WE MAY RECORD LESS REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS EXCEED THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT. CONVERSELY, IF WE OVERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS FOR A PERIOD, WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS AND

CONCESSIONS ARE LESS THAN ESTIMATED.

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED.

FOR NON-EXPIRING, MULTI-DAY TICKETS, REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED OVER A FIVE-YEAR TIME PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS. IF ACTUAL USAGE IS DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATED USAGE, REVENUES MAY NOT BE

RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIODS THE RELATED SERVICES ARE RENDERED. IN ADDITION, A CHANGE IN USAGE PATTERNS WOULD IMPACT THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

THE COMPANYS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE CALCULATED USING A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY MEASUREMENT WHICH WE EVALUATE ANNUALLY. OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE AND

EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS RETIREMENT PATTERNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER AND RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE.

THE DISCOUNT

RATE ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS FOR BENEFITS AS A PRESENT VALUE ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE INCREASES THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES PENSION EXPENSE. THE GUIDELINE FOR SETTING THIS

RATE IS A HIGH-QUALITY LONG-TERM CORPORATE BOND RATE. WE DECREASED OUR DISCOUNT RATE TO 3.85% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2012 FROM 4.75% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2011 TO REFLECT MARKET INTEREST RATE CONDITIONS AT OUR SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 MEASUREMENT DATE.

THIS DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WILL AFFECT NET PERIODIC PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE (BENEFIT EXPENSE) IN FISCAL 2013. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE

COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE

YIELD CURVES. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE TOTAL BENEFIT EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2013 BY $265 MILLION AND WOULD INCREASE THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 BY $2.3 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE TOTAL BENEFIT EXPENSE AND THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $226 MILLION AND $2.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATION, AS WELL AS

HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON EACH PLAN ASSET CLASS. A LOWER EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE. OUR LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.75% FOR BOTH OF THE 2012 AND 2011 ACTUARIAL

VALUATIONS. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN THE LONG-TERM ASSET RETURN ASSUMPTION WOULD IMPACT FISCAL 2013 ANNUAL BENEFIT EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $82 MILLION.

SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY

IS REQUIRED TO TEST GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IF CURRENT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE, ON AN INTERIM BASIS. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY AN

OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN

ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. WE APPLY WHAT

WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES ARE SENSITIVE TO OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARGINS FOR THESE BUSINESSES. WE INCLUDE IN THE PROJECTED CASH

FLOWS AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUE WE BELIEVE THE REPORTING UNIT WOULD RECEIVE IF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE REPORTING UNIT THAT IS BEING USED BY OTHER REPORTING UNITS WAS LICENSED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD-PARTY AT ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE.

THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS THOSE INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS. WE BELIEVE OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE CONSISTENT WITH HOW A MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANT WOULD VALUE OUR REPORTING UNITS.

IN TIMES OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A

GREATER DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS

APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY TESTS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR

CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (TRIGGERING EVENTS) INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ONCE A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST EMPLOYED IS BASED ON WHETHER THE INTENT IS TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR CONTINUED USE OR TO

HOLD THE ASSET FOR SALE. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR ASSETS HELD FOR USE REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED OVER

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET GROUP AGAINST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP. AN ASSET GROUP IS ESTABLISHED BY IDENTIFYING THE LOWEST LEVEL OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY THE GROUP OF ASSETS THAT

ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER ASSETS AND COULD INCLUDE ASSETS USED ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES OR SEGMENTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE

MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GROUPS LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GROUPS LONG-LIVED ASSETS. THE IMPAIRMENT IS ALLOCATED TO THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OF THE GROUP ON A PRO RATA BASIS USING THE

RELATIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH ASSET IS ABOVE ITS FAIR VALUE. FOR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE ASSETS FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS

IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE. DETERMINING WHETHER A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS IMPAIRED REQUIRES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING WHETHER A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ASSET GROUPS, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH

FLOWS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUES. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT ASSET GROUPS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY HAS COST AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE

PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THESE INVESTMENTS, WE CONSIDER THESE FACTORS, AS WELL AS THE FORECASTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

OF THE INVESTEES AND MARKET VALUES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF THESE FORECASTS ARE NOT MET OR MARKET VALUES INDICATE AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.

DURING FISCAL YEARS 2012, 2011 AND 2010, THE COMPANY TESTED ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS

FOR IMPAIRMENT, AND THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED WERE NOT MATERIAL.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

WE EVALUATE OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND ESTIMATE COLLECTABILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL BAD

DEBT EXPERIENCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. IN TIMES OF DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC TURMOIL, OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR

RECEIVABLES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER UNCERTAINTY THAN IN MORE STABLE PERIODS. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS IS TOO LOW, COSTS AND EXPENSES MAY INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND IF IT IS TOO HIGH, COST AND EXPENSES MAY DECREASE IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LOSSES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS. THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED

IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND ARE BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR

ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE PROCEEDINGS. SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.

INCOME TAX AUDITS

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. OUR DETERMINATIONS

REGARDING THE RECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX BENEFITS ARE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE TAX AND LEGAL COUNSEL WHERE APPROPRIATE AND ARE BASED UPON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF OUR TAX POSITIONS IN CONSIDERATION OF APPLICABLE TAX STATUTES AND RELATED

INTERPRETATIONS AND PRECEDENTS AND UPON THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF PROCEEDINGS (OR NEGOTIATIONS) WITH TAXING AND LEGAL AUTHORITIES. THE TAX BENEFITS ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY THE COMPANY MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE RECOGNIZED IN OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS DECISION TO SETTLE RATHER THAN LITIGATE A MATTER, RELEVANT LEGAL PRECEDENT RELATED TO SIMILAR MATTERS AND THE COMPANYS SUCCESS IN SUPPORTING ITS FILING POSITIONS WITH TAXING

AUTHORITIES.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE WRITTEN OR ORAL STATEMENTS

THAT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING, INCLUDING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND IN REPORTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. SUCH STATEMENTS MAY, FOR EXAMPLE, EXPRESS EXPECTATIONS OR

PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE ACTIONS THAT WE MAY TAKE, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING OR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, OR ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL INCLUDING CHANGES IN DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE MADE ON THE BASIS OF

MANAGEMENTS VIEWS AND ASSUMPTIONS AS OF THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE THESE STATEMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WILL NECESSARILY COME TO PASS. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS

AFFECTING THESE EXPECTATIONS ARE SET FORTH UNDER ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS AND

CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN

INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES, COMMODITIES, AND THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE

OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN MINIMUM

AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF

EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW IN ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT

VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS, AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES

TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED, TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE PRINCIPAL FOREIGN CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN, AND

CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES OF ITS

FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES GENERALLY FOR PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED FOUR YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES. THE ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN A

COUNTRY COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COUNTRY OR OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE REVENUE FROM THE COUNTRY.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS ARE TO USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES. THE AMOUNTS HEDGED

USING COMMODITY SWAP CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON FORECASTED LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES, SUCH AS FUEL OIL AND GASOLINE.

IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS

STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY OTHER HEDGING TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

VALUE AT RISK

(VAR)

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VAR MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INTEREST

RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES WERE MADE ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED IN A VAR COMPUTATION. THE

COMPANYS COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES, AND EQUITY PRICES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS WERE DETERMINED BY OBSERVING INTEREST RATE,

FOREIGN CURRENCY, AND EQUITY MARKET CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING QUARTER FOR THE CALCULATION OF VAR AMOUNTS AT FISCAL YEAR END. THE MODEL INCLUDES ALL OF THE COMPANYS DEBT AS WELL AS ALL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH CERTAIN OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WILL BE INCURRED BY

THE COMPANY, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS.

VAR ON A COMBINED BASIS

INCREASED TO $79 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 FROM $58 MILLION AT OCTOBER 1, 2011. THE INCREASE IN VAR PRIMARILY REFLECTED AN INCREASE IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES AND GREATER SENSITIVITY TO INTEREST RATES IN OUR FIXED RATE DEBT

PORTFOLIO.

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH MS. MARY JAYNE PARKER AND MR. KEVIN MAYER, PURSUANT TO WHICH EACH

HAS AGREED TO EXTEND THE TERM OF HIS/HER EMPLOYMENT WITH THE COMPANY.

THE NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT FOR MS. PARKER (THE

PARKER AGREEMENT) WAS ENTERED INTO ON NOVEMBER 16, 2012 AND HAS A STATED TERM COMMENCING AS OF SEPTEMBER 1, 2012 AND ENDING ON JANUARY 31, 2017. THE PARKER AGREEMENT TOOK EFFECT AS OF THE TERMINATION OF THE EMPLOYMENT

AGREEMENT MS. PARKER ENTERED INTO WITH THE COMPANY IN 2009, WHICH EXPIRED BY ITS TERMS ON AUGUST 31, 2012.

ELIGIBLE FOR AN ANNUAL, PERFORMANCE-BASED BONUS UNDER THE COMPANYS APPLICABLE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN (CURRENTLY, THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT INCENTIVE BONUS PROGRAM) AND THAT THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE WILL SET A TARGET BONUS EACH YEAR OF NOT

LESS 125% OF THE ANNUAL BASE SALARY FOR MS. PARKER IN EFFECT AT THE END OF THE PRECEDING FISCAL YEAR. THE ACTUAL AMOUNT PAYABLE TO MS. PARKER AS AN ANNUAL BONUS WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES, WHICH WILL

BE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THE OBJECTIVES ESTABLISHED UNDER THE PLAN FOR OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY. DEPENDING ON PERFORMANCE, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT PAYABLE AS AN ANNUAL BONUS TO MS. PARKER MAY BE LESS THAN, GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO

THE STATED TARGET BONUS (AND COULD BE ZERO).

THE NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT FOR MR. MAYER (THE MAYER

SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THE OBJECTIVES ESTABLISHED UNDER THE PLAN FOR OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY. DEPENDING ON PERFORMANCE, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT PAYABLE AS AN ANNUAL BONUS TO MR. MAYER MAY BE LESS THAN, GREATER THAN OR EQUAL TO THE

STATED TARGET BONUS (AND COULD BE ZERO).

AS TO BOTH MS. PARKER AND MR. MAYER (IN EACH CASE, THE

EXECUTIVE), THE AGREEMENTS ALSO PROVIDE THAT THE EXECUTIVE IS ENTITLED TO PARTICIPATE IN THE COMPANYS EQUITY-BASED LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLANS AND PROGRAMS GENERALLY MADE AVAILABLE TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY AND THAT FOR

EACH FISCAL YEAR DURING THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT, EXECUTIVE WILL BE GRANTED A LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARD HAVING A TARGET VALUE OF NOT LESS THAN TWO TIMES HIS/HER ANNUAL BASE SALARY AT THE END OF THE PRECEDING FISCAL YEAR. THESE AWARDS WILL BE

SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS AND CONDITIONS (INCLUDING VESTING AND PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS) AS WILL BE ESTABLISHED FOR OTHER EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE BOARDS POLICIES FOR THE GRANT OF EQUITY-BASED

AWARDS, AS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME OF THE AWARD, AND DO NOT GUARANTEE THE EXECUTIVE ANY MINIMUM AMOUNT OF COMPENSATION. THE ACTUAL AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO EXECUTIVE IN RESPECT OF SUCH OPPORTUNITIES WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH ANY

PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS AND/OR SERVICE CONDITIONS APPLICABLE TO SUCH AWARDS ARE SATISFIED AND ON THE VALUE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK. ACCORDINGLY, THE EXECUTIVE MAY RECEIVE COMPENSATION IN RESPECT OF ANY SUCH AWARD THAT IS GREATER OR LESS THAN THE

STATED TARGET VALUE, DEPENDING ON WHETHER, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, THE APPLICABLE PERFORMANCE AND OTHER CONDITIONS ARE SATISFIED, AND ON THE VALUE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK.

UNDER BOTH THE PARKER AND MAYER AGREEMENTS, THE EXECUTIVE IS ENTITLED TO PARTICIPATE IN EMPLOYEE BENEFITS AND PERQUISITES GENERALLY MADE AVAILABLE TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY.

UNDER EACH AGREEMENT, THE EXECUTIVES EMPLOYMENT MAY BE TERMINATED BY THE COMPANY FOR CAUSE, WHICH IS DEFINED TO INCLUDE

GROSS NEGLIGENCE, GROSS MISCONDUCT, WILLFUL NONFEASANCE OR A WILLFUL MATERIAL BREACH OF THE AGREEMENT.

EACH EXECUTIVE HAS THE

RIGHT TO TERMINATE HIS/HER EMPLOYMENT FOR GOOD REASON, WHICH IS DEFINED AS (I) A REDUCTION IN ANY OF THE EXECUTIVES BASE SALARY, ANNUAL TARGET BONUS OPPORTUNITY OR ANNUAL TARGET LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARD OPPORTUNITY;

55

TABLE OF CONTENTS

(II) REMOVAL FROM THE EXECUTIVES POSITION (IN MS. PARKERS CASE, EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT, CHIEF HUMAN RESOURCES OFFICER AND IN MR. MAYERS CASE, EXECUTIVE VICE

PRESIDENT, CORPORATE STRATEGY AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT); (III) A MATERIAL REDUCTION IN THE EXECUTIVES DUTIES AND RESPONSIBILITIES; (IV) THE ASSIGNMENT TO EXECUTIVE OF DUTIES THAT ARE MATERIALLY INCONSISTENT WITH HIS/HER POSITION OR

DUTIES OR THAT MATERIALLY IMPAIR HIS/HER ABILITY TO FUNCTION IN HIS/HER CURRENT POSITION OR ANY OTHER POSITION IN WHICH HE/SHE IS THEN SERVING; (VI) RELOCATION OF EXECUTIVES PRINCIPAL OFFICE TO A LOCATION THAT IS MORE THAN 50 MILES

OUTSIDE OF THE GREATER LOS ANGELES AREA; OR (VII) A MATERIAL BREACH OF ANY MATERIAL PROVISION OF THE AGREEMENT BY THE COMPANY. FOLLOWING A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY, AS DEFINED IN THE COMPANYS STOCK PLANS, GOOD REASON ALSO INCLUDES

ANY EVENT THAT IS A TRIGGERING EVENT AS DEFINED IN THE PLANS. A TRIGGERING EVENT IS DEFINED TO INCLUDE A TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT BY THE COMPANY OTHER THAN FOR CAUSE OR A TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT BY THE PARTICIPANT FOLLOWING A

REDUCTION IN POSITION, PAY OR OTHER CONSTRUCTIVE TERMINATION.

UNDER EACH AGREEMENT, IN THE EVENT THAT THE

EXECUTIVES EMPLOYMENT IS TERMINATED BY THE COMPANY WITHOUT CAUSE OR BY THE EXECUTIVE FOR GOOD REASON, THE EXECUTIVE WILL BE ENTITLED TO TERMINATION BENEFITS, WHICH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: (I) A LUMP SUM PAYMENT OF

THE BASE SALARY THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PAYABLE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE AGREEMENT, (II) A PRO-RATED BONUS FOR THE YEAR OF TERMINATION (ANY PRIOR-YEAR BONUS NOT YET PAID AT TIME OF TERMINATION IS ALSO PAID), AND (III) THE

EXECUTIVES OUTSTANDING UNVESTED STOCK OPTIONS AND OUTSTANDING UNVESTED RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT AWARDS THAT COULD VEST IN ACCORDANCE WITH THEIR SCHEDULED VESTING PROVISIONS IF THE EXECUTIVES EMPLOYMENT HAD CONTINUED THROUGH THE REMAINING

TERM OF THE AGREEMENT WILL BE ELIGIBLE TO VEST AT THE SAME TIME AND SUBJECT TO THE SAME PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS AS THOUGH THE EXECUTIVE CONTINUED IN THE COMPANYS EMPLOY, AND ALL STOCK OPTIONS, WHETHER VESTED ON DATE OF TERMINATION OR VESTING

THEREAFTER AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, SHALL VEST AND REMAIN EXERCISABLE TO THE SAME EXTENT AS IF THE EXECUTIVES EMPLOYMENT HAD CONTINUED THROUGH THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT. HOWEVER, EACH AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT, UNLESS NECESSARY TO PRESERVE THE TAX

DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE COMPENSATION PAYABLE IN RESPECT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, THE COMPANY WILL WAIVE ANY PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS RELATED TO PERFORMANCE IN FUTURE FISCAL YEARS THAT WERE IMPOSED PRIMARILY TO PERMIT THE COMPANY TO CLAIM A TAX

DEDUCTION FOR THE COMPENSATION PAYABLE IN RESPECT OF SUCH UNITS.

TO QUALIFY FOR THE FOREGOING CASH SEVERANCE BENEFIT,

PRO-RATED BONUS (AND PRIOR-YEAR BONUS, IF NOT ALREADY PAID), OPPORTUNITY TO VEST IN UNVESTED EQUITY AWARDS AVAILABLE UNDER EACH AGREEMENT AND EXTENDED EXERCISABILITY OF STOCK OPTIONS FOLLOWING AN INVOLUNTARY TERMINATION BY THE COMPANY WITHOUT CAUSE,

OR A TERMINATION BY THE EXECUTIVE FOR GOOD REASON, THE EXECUTIVE MUST EXECUTE A RELEASE IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY AND AGREE TO PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH CERTAIN CONSULTING SERVICES FOR A PERIOD OF SIX MONTHS AFTER HIS/HER TERMINATION (OR, IF LESS, FOR

THE REMAINING TERM OF THE AGREEMENT). ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE PERIOD OF THESE CONSULTING SERVICES, THE EXECUTIVE MUST ALSO AGREE NOT TO PROVIDE ANY SERVICES TO ENTITIES THAT COMPETE WITH ANY OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

THE FOREGOING DESCRIPTION IS QUALIFIED BY REFERENCE TO THE TERMS OF THE PARKER AGREEMENT AND THE MAYER AGREEMENT, WHICH ARE FILED

HEREWITH AS EXHIBITS 10. 7 AND 10.6, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY

AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED FOR EXTERNAL

PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO

FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL

OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE

TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON OUR EVALUATION UNDER THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK,

MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, STATEMENTS OF

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND OCTOBER 1, 2011, AND

THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE

COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT

PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND

OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR

OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS

OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR

PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

BY THE STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT. THESE CHANGES GENERALLY RESULT IN HIGHER REVENUES, EXPENSES AND OPERATING INCOME AT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT WITH OFFSETTING DECLINES AT OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS MAJORITY-OWNED AND CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN

ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO RELATIONSHIPS OR INVESTMENTS WITH OTHER ENTITIES IN WHICH IT DOES NOT

HAVE MAJORITY OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL. IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE ENTITY IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A RELATIONSHIP OR INVESTMENT MAY BE A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE). A VIE IS CONSOLIDATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF THE COMPANY HAS THE POWER TO

DIRECT ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE VIE AND HAS THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS

LESS THAN A 50% DIRECT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN DISNEYLAND PARIS, HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT AND SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT (COLLECTIVELY THE INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS), THEY ARE VIES, AND GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE COMPANYS RELATIONSHIPS

WITH THESE ENTITIES, WHICH INCLUDE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS CONSOLIDATED THE INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

REPORTING PERIOD

THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR ENDS ON THE SATURDAY

CLOSEST TO SEPTEMBER 30 AND CONSISTS OF FIFTY-TWO WEEKS WITH THE EXCEPTION THAT APPROXIMATELY EVERY SIX YEARS, WE HAVE A FIFTY-THREE WEEK YEAR. WHEN A FIFTY-THREE WEEK YEAR OCCURS, THE COMPANY REPORTS THE ADDITIONAL WEEK IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.

NOT BEING PAID, PAST COLLECTION EXPERIENCE AND CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS. IN TIMES OF DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC TURMOIL, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTABILITY OF ITS RECEIVABLES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER

WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION SERIES, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS

FROM DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER. FOR ACQUIRED FILM LIBRARIES, REMAINING REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO BE EARNED FOR UP TO TWENTY YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR

RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS WHICH COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WITH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS EXCEED THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES IS WRITTEN OFF. FILM DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR

PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED OR HAVE NOT BEEN SET FOR PRODUCTION WITHIN THREE YEARS ARE GENERALLY WRITTEN OFF.

THE COSTS

OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS ARE EXPENSED BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR

SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASONS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE OF EACH YEAR IN THE ARRANGEMENT. THE ESTIMATED VALUES OF EACH YEAR ARE BASED ON OUR PROJECTIONS OF REVENUES OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD

WHICH INCLUDE ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE REVENUE. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON APPROXIMATE EACH SEASONS RELATIVE VALUE, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE

SEASON. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM.

THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF NETWORK TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE

REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE: DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, AND SPORTS

(INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL.

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE COSTS

THE COMPANY EXPENSES COSTS INCURRED IN THE

PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE OF DEVELOPING OR ACQUIRING INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE, SUCH AS RESEARCH AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES, AS WELL AS COSTS INCURRED IN THE POST-IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONAL STAGE, SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING. CAPITALIZATION OF

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OCCURS ONLY AFTER THE PRELIMINARY-PROJECT STAGE IS COMPLETE, MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZES THE PROJECT, AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETED AND THE SOFTWARE WILL BE USED FOR THE FUNCTION INTENDED. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND OCTOBER 1, 2011, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS, NET OF ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION, TOTALED $423 MILLION AND $486 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE, RANGING FROM 3-10 YEARS.

SOFTWARE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS

SOFTWARE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCURRED PRIOR TO REACHING TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY ARE EXPENSED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF OUR VIDEO GAME SOFTWARE IS GENERALLY NOT ESTABLISHED UNTIL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS COMPLETE.

GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO TEST GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IF CURRENT

EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE, ON AN INTERIM BASIS. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO

ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING

UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A

PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. WE APPLY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. WE INCLUDE IN THE

PROJECTED CASH FLOWS AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUE WE BELIEVE THE REPORTING UNIT WOULD RECEIVE IF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE REPORTING UNIT THAT IS BEING USED BY OTHER REPORTING UNITS WAS LICENSED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD-PARTY AT ITS FAIR

MARKET VALUE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS THOSE INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS.

IN TIMES OF ADVERSE

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A GREATER DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR

ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY IS

REQUIRED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.

77

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY TESTS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR IMPAIRMENT

WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (TRIGGERING EVENTS) INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ONCE A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST EMPLOYED IS BASED ON WHETHER THE INTENT IS TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR

CONTINUED USE OR TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR SALE. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR ASSETS HELD FOR USE REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET GROUP AGAINST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP. AN ASSET

GROUP IS ESTABLISHED BY IDENTIFYING THE LOWEST LEVEL OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY A GROUP OF ASSETS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER ASSETS AND COULD INCLUDE ASSETS USED ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES OR SEGMENTS. IF THE CARRYING

VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GROUPS LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GROUPS LONG-LIVED

ASSETS. THE IMPAIRMENT IS ALLOCATED TO THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OF THE GROUP ON A PRO RATA BASIS USING THE RELATIVE CARRYING AMOUNT, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH ASSET IS ABOVE ITS FAIR VALUE. FOR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, TO THE

EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE ASSETS FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE.

DURING FISCAL YEARS 2012, 2011 AND 2010, THE COMPANY TESTED ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT, AND THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED WERE NOT MATERIAL.

AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER PERIODS UP TO 40 YEARS. THE COSTS TO PERIODICALLY

RENEW OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO LEGAL, COMPETITIVE, ECONOMIC OR OTHER FACTORS THAT MATERIALLY LIMIT THE USEFUL LIFE OF OUR FCC LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS AGGREGATE ANNUAL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR EXISTING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2013 THROUGH

2017 TO BE AS FOLLOWS.

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, COMMODITIES, AND

INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR UNDERTAKING VARIOUS HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THERE

ARE TWO TYPES OF DERIVATIVES INTO WHICH THE COMPANY ENTERS: HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AND HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE. HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED ASSET, LIABILITY, OR A FIRM

COMMITMENT. HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION (E.G. FORECASTED REVENUE) OR THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED, RELATED TO A RECOGNIZED LIABILITY OR ASSET (E.G. FLOATING RATE

DEBT).

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES AND ASSIGNS THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFIC ASSETS OR

SPECIFIC LIABILITIES. WHEN HEDGED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE SOLD OR EXTINGUISHED OR THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

OPTION PREMIUMS AND UNREALIZED GAINS ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE

AGREEMENTS ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS ASSETS. UNREALIZED LOSSES ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO BE PAID UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN

78

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIABILITIES. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES THE DIFFERENTIAL

FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS AS INTEREST RATES CHANGE AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIVES OF THE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE TERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE SWAP AGREEMENTS, PRIOR TO THEIR ORIGINAL

MATURITY, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS.

THE

COMPANY ENTERS INTO RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THESE CONTRACTS ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET CERTAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURES OF THE COMPANY AND ARE CARRIED AT MARKET VALUE WITH ANY

CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (SEE

NOTES 8 AND 16).

INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED WITH RESPECT TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IN THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF ITEMS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. WHERE,

BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME AMOUNT OF RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE AMOUNT THAT, IN MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT, IS SUFFICIENT

TO REDUCE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

A TAX POSITION MUST MEET A MINIMUM

PROBABILITY THRESHOLD BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION

OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON

ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

THE COMPANY PRESENTS BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AMOUNTS. BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DISNEY BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES

OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EPS IS BASED UPON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR, WHICH IS CALCULATED USING THE TREASURY-STOCK METHOD FOR EQUITY-BASED AWARDS (AWARDS). COMMON

EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION IN PERIODS FOR WHICH THEY HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT. STOCK OPTIONS FOR WHICH THE EXERCISE PRICE EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OVER THE PERIOD ARE ANTI-DILUTIVE AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE EXCLUDED

FROM THE CALCULATION.

A RECONCILIATION OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING AND

THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXCLUDED FROM THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION, AS THEY WERE ANTI-DILUTIVE, ARE AS FOLLOWS.

ACQUISITIONS

AETN

A&E TELEVISION NETWORKS LLC (AETN) OPERATES MULTIPLE CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES AND WAS OWNED 42.1% BY THE COMPANY, 42.1% BY THE

HEARST CORPORATION (HEARST) AND 15.8% BY NBCUNIVERSAL. ON AUGUST 22, 2012, AETN REDEEMED NBCUNIVERSALS ENTIRE 15.8% EQUITY INTEREST FOR APPROXIMATELY $3.0 BILLION. APPROXIMATELY $2.5 BILLION REPRESENTS THE ENTERPRISE VALUE OF

NBCUNIVERSALS EQUITY INTEREST IN AETN, AND THE BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $0.5 BILLION REPRESENTS THE VALUE OF TAX BENEFITS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSACTION, WHICH WAS PAID TO NBCUNIVERSAL IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE AMENDED

AND RESTATED LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANY AGREEMENT OF AETN. THE REDEMPTION OF NBCUNIVERSALS INTEREST WAS FINANCED WITH THIRD-PARTY BORROWINGS AND EQUITY CONTRIBUTIONS OF $300 MILLION EACH FROM THE COMPANY AND HEARST. AS A RESULT OF THE

TRANSACTION, THE COMPANYS AND HEARSTS OWNERSHIP INTEREST EACH INCREASED TO 50%. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR ITS INTEREST IN AETN AS AN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT.

UTV

PURSUANT TO A DELISTING OFFER PROCESS GOVERNED BY INDIAN LAW, ON

FEBRUARY 2, 2012, THE COMPANY PURCHASED PUBLICLY HELD SHARES AND ALL OF THE SHARES HELD BY THE FOUNDER OF UTV SOFTWARE COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED (UTV), A MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY HEADQUARTERED AND PUBLICLY TRADED IN INDIA, FOR $377 MILLION.

THE COMPANY ALSO ASSUMED APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION OF UTVS BORROWINGS. THE PURCHASE INCREASED THE COMPANYS OWNERSHIP INTEREST TO 93% FROM 50%. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS ACCOUNTING FOR UTV FROM AN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT TO A

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY. THE ACQUISITION OF UTV SUPPORTS THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC PRIORITY OF INCREASING ITS BRAND PRESENCE AND REACH IN KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

UPON CONSOLIDATION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A NON-CASH GAIN OF $184 MILLION ($116 MILLION AFTER TAX) AS A RESULT OF ADJUSTING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANYS 50% EQUITY INVESTMENT TO ITS ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE OF $405 MILLION. THE GAIN WAS RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME /(EXPENSE), NET IN THE FISCAL 2012 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE FAIR VALUE WAS DETERMINED BASED ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL VALUATION OF THE UTV BUSINESS USING

AN INCOME APPROACH (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL) WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES PROVIDES THE MOST APPROPRIATE INDICATOR OF FAIR VALUE.

THE COMPANY HAS PERFORMED A FINAL ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED. THE MAJORITY OF THE PURCHASE PRICE

HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO GOODWILL, WHICH IS NOT AMORTIZABLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE GOODWILL REFLECTS THE SYNERGIES AND INCREASED INDIAN MARKET PENETRATION EXPECTED FROM COMBINING THE OPERATIONS OF UTV AND THE COMPANY.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDIAN SECURITIES REGULATION, THE COMPANY CAN BE REQUIRED TO PURCHASE ANY OUTSTANDING UTV SHARES AT THE ELECTION OF

EACH REMAINING UTV SHAREHOLDER FOR 1,100 INDIAN RUPEES PER SHARE UNTIL MARCH 16, 2013. TO DATE, THE COMPANY HAS PAID $63 MILLION TO ACQUIRE AN INCREMENTAL 6% INTEREST BRINGING ITS OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE TO 99%.

SEVEN TV

ON

NOVEMBER 18, 2011, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A 49% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN SEVEN TV, A BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORK IN RUSSIA, FOR $300 MILLION. FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION, THIS NETWORK WAS CONVERTED TO AN AD-SUPPORTED, FREE-TO-AIR DISNEY CHANNEL. THE

COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INTEREST IN SEVEN TV AS AN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT.

PLAYDOM

ON AUGUST 27, 2010, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED PLAYDOM, INC. (PLAYDOM), A COMPANY THAT DEVELOPS ONLINE SOCIAL GAMES. THIS ACQUISITION IS

DESIGNED TO STRENGTHEN THE COMPANYS INTERACTIVE GAME PORTFOLIO AND PROVIDE ACCESS TO A NEW CUSTOMER BASE. TOTAL CONSIDERATION WAS APPROXIMATELY $563 MILLION, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $108 MILLION IS

SUBJECT TO VESTING CONDITIONS AND RECOGNIZED AS POST-CLOSE COMPENSATION EXPENSE. ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION OF UP TO $200 MILLION MAY BE PAID IF PLAYDOM ACHIEVES PREDEFINED REVENUES AND EARNINGS TARGETS FOR CALENDAR YEAR 2012. THE COMPANY INITIALLY

RECOGNIZED THE FAIR VALUE (DETERMINED BY A PROBABILITY WEIGHTING OF THE POTENTIAL PAYOUTS) OF THE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION AS A LIABILITY. SUBSEQUENT CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE, UP TO THE ULTIMATE AMOUNT TO BE PAID, IF ANY, ARE RECOGNIZED

IN EARNINGS. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MAKING ANY SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS IN RESPECT OF THE ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATION.

MARVEL

ON DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A CASH AND STOCK ACQUISITION FOR THE OUTSTANDING CAPITAL STOCK OF MARVEL ENTERTAINMENT,

PRICE OF $32.25).

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ALLOCATE THE PURCHASE PRICE TO TANGIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES. THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THOSE FAIR VALUES IS RECORDED AS GOODWILL.

IN SEPTEMBER 2012, THE COMPANY PROVIDED DISNEYLAND PARIS WITH 1.3 BILLION ($1.7 BILLION) OF INTERCOMPANY FINANCING, BRINGING THE TOTAL FINANCING PROVIDED TO DISNEYLAND PARIS TO 1.7 BILLION

($2.2 BILLION) AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012. DISNEYLAND PARIS USED THE NEW FINANCING TO REPAY ITS OUTSTANDING THIRD-PARTY BANK DEBT. THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET CHARGE OF $24 MILLION ON THE REPAYMENT OF THE THIRD-PARTY BANK DEBT. CERTAIN OF THE

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING COVENANTS, NOTABLY THOSE RELATED TO CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND THE PAYMENT OF ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES DUE TO THE COMPANY WERE ELIMINATED.

HONG

KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT CAPITAL REALIGNMENT

IN JULY 2009, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A CAPITAL REALIGNMENT AND EXPANSION PLAN

FOR HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT (HKDL) WITH THE GOVERNMENT OF THE HONG KONG SPECIAL ADMINISTRATIVE REGION (HKSAR), HKDLS MAJORITY SHAREHOLDER. KEY PROVISIONS OF THE PLAN INCLUDE.



THE COMPANY CONVERTED ITS $354 MILLION TERM AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY LOAN TO HKDL INTO EQUITY DURING FISCAL 2009. THIS WAS ACCOMPANIED BY

CONVERSION OF AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF THE HKSAR LOAN TO HKDL INTO EQUITY.



THE COMPANY WOULD MAKE APPROXIMATELY $0.4 BILLION OF EQUITY CONTRIBUTIONS TO FUND HKDL DURING THE EXPANSION, WHICH IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO BE

COMPLETED IN PHASES BY 2013. THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF EQUITY CONTRIBUTIONS BY THE COMPANY MAY DIFFER DEPENDING ON THE ACTUAL FINAL COST OF THE EXPANSION AND OPERATING RESULTS OF HKDL DURING THE RELEVANT TIMEFRAME. THE HKSAR WILL CONVERT AN ADDITIONAL

AMOUNT OF ITS LOAN TO HKDL EQUAL TO THESE CONTRIBUTIONS INTO EQUITY, SUBJECT TO A MAXIMUM CONVERSION AMOUNT THAT WOULD LEAVE APPROXIMATELY HK $1.0 BILLION ($129 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 EXCHANGE RATES) OF THE HKSAR LOAN TO HKDL

OUTSTANDING. AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE HKSAR LOAN TO HKDL WAS $267 MILLION. THROUGH FISCAL 2012, THE COMPANY HAS MADE EQUITY CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $0.3 BILLION AND HKSAR HAS CONVERTED AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF ITS LOAN TO HKDL TO EQUITY. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE MAKING ADDITIONAL EQUITY CONTRIBUTIONS RELATED TO THE CAPITAL REALIGNMENT AND EXPANSION PLAN.

AS A RESULT OF THE ABOVE ARRANGEMENT, THE COMPANYS INTEREST IN HKDL HAS INCREASED FROM 43% TO 48%.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE PRINCIPALLY RELATES TO TAX ATTRIBUTES OF $193 MILLION ACQUIRED WITH UTV AND A

CARRYFORWARD PERIOD, WOULD NOT HAVE AN IMPACT ON NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DISNEY AS ANY INCOME TAX BENEFIT WOULD BE OFFSET BY A CHARGE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN THE INCOME STATEMENT.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANY HAD UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES OF APPROXIMATELY $566 MILLION FOR WHICH

DEFERRED TAXES HAVE NOT BEEN PROVIDED. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO REINVEST THESE EARNINGS FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IF THESE AMOUNTS WERE DISTRIBUTED TO THE UNITED STATES, IN THE FORM OF DIVIDENDS OR OTHERWISE, THE COMPANY WOULD BE SUBJECT TO

ADDITIONAL U.S. INCOME TAXES. ASSUMING THE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED FOREIGN EARNINGS WERE REPATRIATED UNDER LAWS AND RATES APPLICABLE AT 2012 FISCAL YEAR END, THE INCREMENTAL FEDERAL TAX APPLICABLE TO THE EARNINGS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION.

RESPECTIVELY, THAT IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD REDUCE OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NET OF THE OFFSETTING BENEFITS FROM OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS.

AS OF THE END OF FISCAL 2012, 2011 AND 2010, THE COMPANY HAD $209 MILLION, $175 MILLION AND $163 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS. DURING 2012,

2011 AND 2010, THE COMPANY ACCRUED ADDITIONAL INTEREST OF $25 MILLION, $17 MILLION AND $28 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND RECORDED REDUCTIONS IN ACCRUED INTEREST OF $12 MILLION, $13 MILLION AND $7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS A RESULT OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS

AND OTHER PRIOR-YEAR ADJUSTMENTS. THE COMPANYS POLICY IS TO REPORT INTEREST AND PENALTIES AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

DURING THE CURRENT YEAR, THE COMPANY RESOLVED VARIOUS REFUND CLAIMS AND OTHER MATTERS WITH TAX AUTHORITIES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AND FOREIGN TAX AUDITS. THE COMPANY

IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL EXAMINATION FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2008. THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION IN ANY OF ITS MAJOR STATE OR FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS FOR YEARS PRIOR TO 2003.

IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS COULD CHANGE DUE TO THE RESOLUTION OF TAX

MATTERS, INCLUDING PAYMENTS ON THE TAX MATTERS DISCUSSED ABOVE. THESE RESOLUTIONS AND PAYMENTS COULD REDUCE OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS BY $81 MILLION.

IN FISCAL 2012, 2011 AND 2010, INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY-BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS EXCEEDED THE AMOUNTS RECORDED BASED ON GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, $120 MILLION, $109

MILLION AND $61 MILLION WERE CREDITED TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, RESPECTIVELY IN THESE YEARS.

DECEMBER 31, 2011. THE COMPANY REDUCED THE VESTING REQUIREMENT FROM FIVE YEARS OF VESTING SERVICE TO THREE YEARS OF VESTING SERVICE, REVISED THE EARLY RETIREMENT REDUCTION FACTORS AND EXCLUDED EMPLOYEES HIRED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2011 FROM

PLAN PARTICIPATION. IN ADDITION, THE PERCENTAGE OF AVERAGE MONTHLY COMPENSATION ON WHICH SALARY-RELATED BENEFITS ARE BASED WAS REDUCED WHILE OVERTIME, COMMISSIONS AND REGULAR BONUS AMOUNTS WERE ADDED TO THE CALCULATION OF AVERAGE MONTHLY

COMPENSATION RECEIVED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2011 TO THE EXTENT THOSE ELEMENTS OF COMPENSATION WERE NOT PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED.

THE FOLLOWING CHART SUMMARIZES THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, ASSETS, FUNDED STATUS AND BALANCE SHEET IMPACTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS BASED UPON THE ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS PREPARED AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND OCTOBER 1, 2011.

PLAN ASSETS

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE MANAGED ON A COMMINGLED BASIS IN A THIRD-PARTY MASTER

TRUST. THE INVESTMENT POLICY AND ALLOCATION OF THE ASSETS IN THE MASTER TRUST WERE APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE WHICH HAS OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMPANYS RETIREMENT PLANS. THE INVESTMENT

THE PRIMARY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE FOR THE ASSETS WITHIN THE MASTER TRUST IS THE PRUDENT AND COST EFFECTIVE

MANAGEMENT OF ASSETS TO SATISFY BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. FINANCIAL RISKS ARE MANAGED THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION OF PLAN ASSETS, SELECTION OF INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND THROUGH THE INVESTMENT GUIDELINES INCORPORATED IN INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. ASSETS ARE MONITORED TO ENSURE THAT INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE COMMENSURATE WITH RISKS TAKEN.

THE

LONG-TERM ASSET ALLOCATION POLICY FOR THE MASTER TRUST WAS ESTABLISHED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE AVERAGE AGE OF PARTICIPANTS, THE NUMBER OF RETIREES, THE DURATION OF LIABILITIES AND THE

EXPECTED PAYOUT RATIO. LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF THE MASTER TRUST ARE GENERALLY MANAGED USING CASH GENERATED BY INVESTMENTS OR BY LIQUIDATING SECURITIES.

ASSETS ARE GENERALLY MANAGED BY EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND WE HAVE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO SECURITIES IN THE MASTER TRUST. THESE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE ACCOUNT GUIDELINES THAT

ESTABLISH PERMITTED SECURITIES AND RISK CONTROLS COMMENSURATE WITH THE ACCOUNTS INVESTMENT STRATEGY. SOME AGREEMENTS PERMIT THE USE OF DERIVATIVE SECURITIES (FUTURES, OPTIONS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS) THAT ENABLE INVESTMENT

MANAGERS TO ENHANCE RETURNS AND MANAGE EXPOSURES WITHIN THEIR ACCOUNTS. INVESTMENT MANAGERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM USING DERIVATIVES TO LEVERAGE RETURNS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF PLAN ASSETS

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FOR SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION

BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS. THE COMPANYS DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING CATEGORIES.



LEVEL 1  QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS



LEVEL 2  QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT

ACTIVE; AND MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS IN WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS AND SIGNIFICANT VALUE DRIVERS ARE OBSERVABLE IN ACTIVE MARKETS



LEVEL 3  VALUATIONS DERIVED FROM VALUATION TECHNIQUES IN WHICH ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS OR SIGNIFICANT VALUE DRIVERS ARE UNOBSERVABLE

FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED FOR ASSETS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. THERE

HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE METHODOLOGIES USED AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND OCTOBER 1, 2011.

LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS ARE

VALUED BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE YEAR. INVESTMENTS IN COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS ARE VALUED BASED ON THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE-LISTED PRICE OR A BROKERS QUOTE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET. INVESTMENTS IN U.S.

TREASURY SECURITIES ARE VALUED BASED ON A BROKERS QUOTE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET.

LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN GOVERNMENT

AND FEDERAL AGENCY BONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AND CORPORATE BONDS ARE VALUED USING A BROKERS QUOTE IN A NON-ACTIVE MARKET OR AN EVALUATED PRICE BASED ON A COMPILATION OF REPORTED MARKET INFORMATION, SUCH AS BENCHMARK

YIELD CURVES, CREDIT SPREADS AND ESTIMATED DEFAULT RATES. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE VALUED BASED ON MODELS THAT INCORPORATE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES, SUCH AS INTEREST RATES. SHARES IN MONEY MARKET AND MUTUAL FUNDS

ARE VALUED AT THE NET ASSET VALUE OF THE SHARES HELD BY THE PLAN AT YEAR-END BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS.

LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY CONSIST OF INVESTMENTS IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, WHICH ARE VALUED BASED ON THE MASTER TRUSTS PRO-RATA SHARE OF PARTNERSHIP HOLDINGS AS OF YEAR-END. THE FAIR VALUES OF

THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS ARE ESTIMATED USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (E.G., DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS OR RELATIVE VALUATION METHODS THAT INCORPORATE COMPARABLE MARKET INFORMATION SUCH AS EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW MULTIPLES FROM SIMILAR

PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES OR REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES).

UNCALLED CAPITAL COMMITMENTS

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE MASTER TRUST INCLUDE INTERESTS IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS THAT HAVE RIGHTS TO MAKE CAPITAL CALLS TO THE LIMITED PARTNER INVESTORS. IN SUCH CASES, THE MASTER TRUST WOULD BE

CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO MAKE A CASH CAPITAL CONTRIBUTION TO THE LIMITED PARTNERSHIP AT THE TIME OF A CAPITAL CALL. AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE TOTAL COMMITTED CAPITAL STILL UNCALLED AND UNPAID WAS $512 MILLION.

PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS

DURING FISCAL 2012, THE COMPANY MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS TOTALING $905 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED

DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS IN FISCAL 2013 TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $425 MILLION TO $475 MILLION. FINAL MINIMUM

FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR FISCAL 2013 WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON OUR JANUARY 1, 2013 FUNDING ACTUARIAL VALUATION WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE BY THE END OF THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2013.

ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS THE DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE, HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST AS WELL AS THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

98

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISCOUNT RATE

 THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE FOR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL

PLANS REFLECTS THE MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE

BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

LONG-TERM RATE

OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

 THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM RETURNS ON AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTING OF A MIXTURE OF EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS. WHEN DETERMINING

THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON THE ASSET CLASSES (BOTH HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED) IN WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE PENSION FUNDS TO BE INVESTED. THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN

BY ASSET CLASS WERE CONSIDERED IN SETTING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION.

EQUITY SECURITIES

DEBT SECURITIES

HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE

 THE COMPANY REVIEWS EXTERNAL DATA AND ITS OWN HISTORICAL TRENDS

FOR HEALTHCARE COSTS TO DETERMINE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATES FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS. FOR THE 2012 ACTUARIAL VALUATION, WE ASSUMED A 7.50% ANNUAL RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE CLAIMS WITH THE

RATE DECREASING IN EVEN INCREMENTS OVER FOURTEEN YEARS UNTIL REACHING 4.50%.

MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION PLANS

THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN A NUMBER OF MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION PLANS UNDER UNION AND INDUSTRY-WIDE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THAT COVER OUR UNION-REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES AND EXPENSES ITS CONTRIBUTIONS

TO THESE PLANS AS INCURRED. THESE PLANS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR RETIREMENT, DEATH AND/OR TERMINATION BENEFITS FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE APPLICABLE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS, BASED ON SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY/PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS, VESTING

PERIODS AND BENEFIT FORMULAS. THE RISKS OF PARTICIPATING IN THESE MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS ARE DIFFERENT FROM SINGLE-EMPLOYER PLANS IN THE FOLLOWING RESPECTS.



ASSETS CONTRIBUTED TO THE MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN BY ONE EMPLOYER MAY BE USED TO PROVIDE BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES OF OTHER PARTICIPATING

EMPLOYERS.



IF A PARTICIPATING EMPLOYER STOPS CONTRIBUTING TO THE MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN, THE UNFUNDED OBLIGATIONS OF THE PLAN MAY BECOME THE OBLIGATION OF THE

REMAINING PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS.



IF THE COMPANY CHOOSES TO STOP PARTICIPATING IN SOME OF THESE MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY THOSE PLANS AN AMOUNT BASED ON

THE UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF THE PLAN, REFERRED TO AS A WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY.

THE COMPANY ALSO PARTICIPATES IN

SEVERAL MULTIEMPLOYER HEALTH AND WELFARE PLANS THAT COVER BOTH ACTIVE AND RETIRED EMPLOYEES. HEALTH CARE BENEFITS ARE PROVIDED TO PARTICIPANTS WHO MEET CERTAIN ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS AS COVERED UNDER THE APPLICABLE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT.

EQUITY-BASED

COMPENSATION

UNDER VARIOUS PLANS, THE COMPANY MAY GRANT STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY-BASED AWARDS TO EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT, AND

CREATIVE PERSONNEL. THE COMPANYS APPROACH TO LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION CONTEMPLATES AWARDS OF STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS). CERTAIN RSUS AWARDED TO SENIOR EXECUTIVES VEST BASED UPON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF MARKET AND/OR

PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS (PERFORMANCE RSUS).

STOCK OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY GRANTED AT EXERCISE PRICES EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING THE

MARKET PRICE AT THE DATE OF GRANT AND BECOME EXERCISABLE RATABLY OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE GRANT DATE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR OUR STOCK OPTION GRANTS.

STARTING MARCH 2009 FOR OUR PRIMARY PLAN, EACH SHARE GRANTED SUBJECT TO A STOCK OPTION AWARD REDUCES THE

NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE BY ONE SHARE WHILE EACH SHARE GRANTED SUBJECT TO A RSU AWARD REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE BY TWO SHARES. IN MARCH 2011, SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY APPROVED THE 2011 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, WHICH INCREASED THE

NUMBER OF SHARES AUTHORIZED TO BE AWARDED AS GRANTS BY 64 MILLION SHARES. IN MARCH 2012, SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY APPROVED AN AMENDMENT TO THE 2011 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, WHICH INCREASED THE NUMBER OF SHARES AUTHORIZED TO BE AWARDED AS GRANTS

BY AN INCREMENTAL 15 MILLION SHARES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE (ASSUMING ALL THE AWARDS ARE IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS) WAS APPROXIMATELY 133 MILLION SHARES AND THE NUMBER

AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE ASSUMING ALL AWARDS ARE IN THE FORM OF RSUS WAS APPROXIMATELY 67 MILLION SHARES. THE COMPANY SATISFIES STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF RSUS WITH NEWLY ISSUED SHARES. STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS ARE GENERALLY FORFEITED BY

EMPLOYEES WHO TERMINATE PRIOR TO VESTING.

EACH YEAR, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY AWARDS STOCK OPTIONS AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO A BROAD-BASED GROUP OF MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL. THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS VOLATILITY, DIVIDEND

YIELD, AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE (THE MULTIPLE OF EXERCISE PRICE TO GRANT PRICE AT WHICH EXERCISES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON AVERAGE) AND THE TERMINATION RATE (THE

PROBABILITY OF A VESTED OPTION BEING CANCELLED DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE OPTION HOLDER) IN COMPUTING THE VALUE OF THE OPTION.

IN FISCAL YEARS 2012, 2011 AND 2010, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OPTION-VALUATION MODEL WERE AS FOLLOWS.

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS NOT ADJUSTED AFTER THE GRANT DATE, CHANGES IN THE

COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE THE VALUE OF, AND THEREFORE THE EXPENSE RELATED TO, FUTURE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE GREATEST VARIATION IN FAIR VALUE IN THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ARE THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND

EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN EITHER THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE WILL CAUSE THE BINOMIAL OPTION VALUE TO INCREASE OR DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION CONSIDERS BOTH HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS WELL

AS CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS AND STOCK OPTIONS IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE

PERIOD OF THE AWARD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS IS BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE AWARDS ON THE GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR PERFORMANCE RSUS REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITY THAT THE MARKET AND/OR PERFORMANCE

CONDITIONS WILL BE MET. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2010, EQUITY-BASED AWARD GRANTS GENERALLY PROVIDE CONTINUED VESTING, IN THE EVENT OF TERMINATION, FOR EMPLOYEES THAT REACH AGE 60 OR GREATER, HAVE AT LEAST TEN YEARS OF SERVICE AND HAVE HELD THE AWARD FOR AT

LEAST ONE YEAR.

THE COMPANY HAS A MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT BY COUNTERPARTY WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. CONTRACTS IN A LIABILITY POSITION TOTALING

$153 MILLION AND $167 MILLION HAVE BEEN NETTED AGAINST CONTRACTS IN AN ASSET POSITION IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND OCTOBER 1, 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUE OF LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS IS PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY REFERENCE TO MARKET PRICES BASED ON RECENT TRADING ACTIVITY AND OTHER

RELEVANT INFORMATION INCLUDING PRICING FOR SIMILAR SECURITIES AS DETERMINED BY THIRD-PARTY PRICING SERVICES.

THE FAIR VALUES

OF LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS USING INTERNAL MODELS THAT USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK,

WHICH IS MITIGATED BY MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERAL POSTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES.

LEVEL 2 BORROWINGS, WHICH INCLUDE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND U.S. MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, ARE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS

IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

LEVEL 3 RESIDUAL INTERESTS RELATE TO SECURITIZED VACATION OWNERSHIP MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES AND ARE VALUED

USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT CONSIDERS ESTIMATED INTEREST RATES, DISCOUNT RATES, PREPAYMENT, AND DEFAULTS. ON JUNE 5, 2012, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED PREVIOUSLY SOLD MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES.

LEVEL 3 BORROWINGS, WHICH INCLUDE INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS BORROWINGS AND OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS, ARE VALUED

BASED ON HISTORICAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT RISK AND MARKET LIQUIDITY.

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS ALSO INCLUDE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNT PAYABLE. THE CARRYING VALUES OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS APPROXIMATE THE FAIR VALUES.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS WHEN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR. DURING FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011, THE COMPANY

RECORDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $121 MILLION AND $46 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, ON FILM PRODUCTIONS. THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE REPORTED IN COSTS AND EXPENSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE FILM IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REFLECTED

THE EXCESS OF THE UNAMORTIZED COST OF THE FILMS OVER THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS IS A LEVEL 3 VALUATION TECHNIQUE. THE AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUES OF THE FILMS FOR WHICH WE PREPARED THE FAIR

VALUE ANALYSES WERE $172 MILLION AND $86 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND OCTOBER 1, 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS WITH, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE COUNTERPARTIES TO ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY

THE COUNTERPARTIES.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT IT WOULD REALIZE A MATERIAL LOSS, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY SINGLE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS ONLY WITH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF A- OR BETTER.

THE COMPANYS CURRENT POLICY REGARDING AGREEMENTS WITH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES IS GENERALLY TO REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A- OR IN THE EVENT AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED LIMITS AS DEFINED BY CONTRACT. IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE MATERIAL CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF LESS THAN INVESTMENT GRADE. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, THE COMPANYS BALANCES THAT EXCEEDED 10% OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WITH INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS WERE 44% OF TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS COMPARED TO 41% AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2011.

THE COMPANYS TRADE

RECEIVABLES AND FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 DUE TO THE WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS INTO WHICH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD, THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO AMONG ISSUERS.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS BORROWING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND

CASH FLOWS AND ON THE MARKET VALUE OF ITS BORROWINGS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS ITS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY USES PAY-FLOATING AND

PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO FACILITATE ITS INTEREST RATE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES PAY-FLOATING

INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS EFFECTIVELY CONVERTING FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS TO VARIABLE RATE BORROWINGS INDEXED TO LIBOR. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND OCTOBER 1, 2011, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE

COMPANYS PAY-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS $3.1 BILLION AND $1.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO FAIR VALUE HEDGES INCLUDED IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

(17)

THE COMPANY MAY DESIGNATE PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF INTEREST PAYMENTS ON

FLOATING-RATE BORROWINGS. PAY-FIXED SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FLOATING RATE BORROWINGS TO FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS. THE UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THESE CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE DEFERRED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) AND RECOGNIZED

IN INTEREST EXPENSE AS THE INTEREST PAYMENTS OCCUR. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF INTEREST PAYMENTS AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 NOR AT OCTOBER 1, 2011.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY TRANSACTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW FLUCTUATIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES, ENABLING MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO OPTION AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE

OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, FIRM COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY HEDGES ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS FOR PERIODS

GENERALLY NOT TO EXCEED FOUR YEARS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM RANGE OF ANNUAL EXPOSURE. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED FORECASTED TRANSACTION, ASSET, LIABILITY

OR FIRM COMMITMENT. THE PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, CANADIAN DOLLAR AND BRITISH POUND. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BORROWINGS INTO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS.

MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS ARE DEFERRED IN AOCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS OCCUR, OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. GAINS AND LOSSES RECOGNIZED RELATED TO

INEFFECTIVENESS FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND OCTOBER 1, 2011 WERE NOT MATERIAL. NET DEFERRED LOSSES RECORDED IN AOCI FOR CONTRACTS THAT WILL MATURE IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS TOTALED $10 MILLION.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS WITH RESPECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND DO

NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THE NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND OCTOBER 1, 2011 WERE $4.1 BILLION AND $2.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE NET GAINS OR LOSSES

RECOGNIZED IN COSTS AND EXPENSES ON THE ECONOMIC EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND THE OFFSETTING NET GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE RELATED FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND

COMMODITY PRICE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE VOLATILITY OF COMMODITIES PRICES AND DESIGNATES CERTAIN COMMODITY FORWARD CONTRACTS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FORECASTED COMMODITY PURCHASES. MARK-TO-MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON

THESE CONTRACTS ARE DEFERRED IN AOCI AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS OCCUR, OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF COMMODITY PURCHASES. THE FAIR VALUE OF COMMODITY HEDGING CONTRACTS WAS NOT MATERIAL AT SEPTEMBER 29, 2012

NOR AT OCTOBER 1, 2011.

RISK MANAGEMENT  OTHER DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CERTAIN OTHER RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING.

THESE CONTRACTS, WHICH INCLUDE PAY FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CERTAIN COMMODITY SWAP CONTRACTS, ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET ECONOMIC EXPOSURES OF THE COMPANY AND ARE CARRIED AT MARKET VALUE WITH ANY CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS.

AT OCTOBER 1, 2011, THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF PAY FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WAS $184 MILLION. ON JUNE 5, 2012,

THE COMPANY TERMINATED THESE PAY FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS IN CONNECTION WITH THE REPURCHASE OF SECURITIZED VACATION OWNERSHIP MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES. FOR FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011, GAINS OR LOSSES RECOGNIZED IN INCOME ON THESE RISK MANAGEMENT

CONTRACTS WERE NOT MATERIAL. AS OF SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND OCTOBER 1, 2011, THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF COMMODITY SWAP CONTRACTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES WAS NOT MATERIAL.

CONTINGENT FEATURES

THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO POST COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT THAT A NET LIABILITY POSITION WITH A COUNTERPARTY EXCEEDS LIMITS DEFINED BY CONTRACT AND THAT VARY WITH THE COMPANYS CREDIT RATING. IF THE COMPANYS CREDIT RATINGS WERE TO FALL BELOW

INVESTMENT GRADE, SUCH COUNTERPARTIES WOULD ALSO HAVE THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO A NET PAYMENT TO OR FROM THE COMPANY FOR THE AGGREGATE NET VALUE BY COUNTERPARTY OF OUR DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE AGGREGATE

FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WITH CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES IN A NET LIABILITY POSITION BY COUNTERPARTY WERE $82 MILLION AND $114 MILLION ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2012 AND OCTOBER 1, 2011, RESPECTIVELY.
