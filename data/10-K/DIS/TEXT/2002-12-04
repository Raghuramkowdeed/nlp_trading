COMPETITION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

PROTECTION

THE SUCCESS OF THE STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT

OPERATIONS IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON PUBLIC TASTE, WHICH IS

UNPREDICTABLE AND SUBJECT TO CHANGE. IN ADDITION, STUDIO

ENTERTAINMENT OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND

PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT

AND TELEVISION MARKETS. RELEASE DATES ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL

FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF VACATION AND

HOLIDAY PERIODS.

THE STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH

ALL FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPANIES

PRODUCE AND/OR DISTRIBUTE THEATRICAL AND TELEVISION FILMS,

EXPLOIT PRODUCTS IN THE HOME VIDEO/ DVD MARKET, PROVIDE PAY

TELEVISION PROGRAMMING SERVICES AND SPONSOR LIVE THEATER. WE

ALSO COMPETE TO OBTAIN CREATIVE AND PERFORMING TALENTS, STORY

PROPERTIES, ADVERTISER SUPPORT, BROADCAST RIGHTS AND MARKET

SHARE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF ALL OF OUR STUDIO

ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO DISTRIBUTE AND

EXPLOIT ITS MOTION PICTURE AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING IS

AFFECTED BY THE STRENGTH AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY PROTECTIONS IN BOTH THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD.

CONSUMER PRODUCTS

THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT LICENSES THE

COMPANYS CHARACTERS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO

MANUFACTURERS, RETAILERS, SHOW PROMOTERS AND PUBLISHERS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. CHARACTER MERCHANDISING AND PUBLICATIONS

LICENSING PROMOTES THE COMPANYS FILMS AND TELEVISION

PROGRAMS, AS WELL AS THE COMPANYS OTHER OPERATIONS.

COMPANY SUBSIDIARIES ALSO ENGAGE IN RETAIL, DIRECT MAIL AND

ONLINE DISTRIBUTION OF PRODUCTS BASED ON THE COMPANYS

CHARACTERS AND FILMS THROUGH THE DISNEY STORE, DISNEY CATALOG

COMICS WORLDWIDE; AND PRODUCE AND LICENSE COMPUTER SOFTWARE AND

CHARACTER MERCHANDISE AND PUBLICATIONS

LICENSING

THE COMPANYS WORLDWIDE LICENSING ACTIVITIES

GENERATE ROYALTIES, WHICH ARE USUALLY BASED ON A FIXED

PERCENTAGE OF THE WHOLESALE OR RETAIL SELLING PRICE OF THE

LICENSEES PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY LICENSES CHARACTERS BASED

UPON BOTH TRADITIONAL AND NEWLY CREATED FILM, TELEVISION AND

OTHER PROPERTIES. CHARACTER MERCHANDISE CATEGORIES THAT HAVE

BEEN LICENSED INCLUDE APPAREL, TOYS, GIFTS, HOME FURNISHINGS AND

HOUSEWARES, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, STATIONERY, SPORTING GOODS AND

FOOD, BEVERAGE AND PACKAGED GOODS. PUBLICATION CATEGORIES THAT

HAVE BEEN LICENSED INCLUDE CHILDRENS BOOKS,

CONTINUITY-SERIES BOOKS, BOOK SETS, ART AND PICTURE BOOKS AND

MAGAZINES.

IN ADDITION TO RECEIVING LICENSING FEES, THE

COMPANY IS ACTIVELY INVOLVED IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND APPROVAL OF

LICENSED MERCHANDISE AND IN THE CONCEPTUALIZATION, DEVELOPMENT,

WRITING AND ILLUSTRATION OF LICENSED PUBLICATIONS. WE

CONTINUALLY SEEK TO CREATE NEW CHARACTERS TO BE USED IN LICENSED

PRODUCTS.

DISNEY STORES

THE COMPANY MARKETS DISNEY-RELATED PRODUCTS

DIRECTLY THROUGH ITS RETAIL FACILITIES OPERATED UNDER THE

DISNEY STORE NAME. THESE FACILITIES ARE GENERALLY

LOCATED IN LEADING SHOPPING MALLS AND SIMILAR RETAIL COMPLEXES.

THE STORES CARRY A WIDE VARIETY OF DISNEY MERCHANDISE AND

PROMOTE OTHER BUSINESSES OF THE COMPANY. DURING FISCAL 2002, WE

OPENED ONE NEW STORE IN EACH OF THE EUROPEAN, JAPANESE AND ASIA/

PACIFIC REGIONS AND CLOSED 90 STORES WORLDWIDE. THE TOTAL

NUMBER OF STORES WAS 560 AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2002

(429 STORES DOMESTICALLY AND 131 STORES

INTERNATIONALLY). THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CLOSE ADDITIONAL STORES

IN THE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY SOLD 46 STORES TO

ORIENTAL LAND CO., LTD., THE OWNER AND OPERATOR OF THE

TOKYO DISNEY RESORT, DURING THE YEAR, CONCURRENTLY ENTERING INTO

A LICENSE AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO WHICH A COMPANY SUBSIDIARY

RECEIVES ROYALTIES BASED ON THE SOLD STORES PERFORMANCE.

DIRECT MARKETING

THE DIRECT MARKETING BUSINESS OPERATES THE DISNEY

RESPECTIVELY. OFFERINGS INCLUDE MERCHANDISE DEVELOPED

EXCLUSIVELY FOR THE DISNEY CATALOG AND DISNEYSTORE.COM AS WELL

AS PRODUCTS FROM DISNEY STORE, OTHER INTERNAL DISNEY UNITS AND

DISNEY LICENSEES. THE CATALOG AND ONLINE SITE ARE INTEGRATED,

WHERE APPROPRIATE, WITH DISNEY STORE IN PRODUCT SELECTION,

DESIGN AND MARKETING EFFORTS. THE DISNEY CATALOG ALSO OPERATES

ITS OWN RETAIL OUTLET STORES FOR THE PURPOSE OF SELLING

OVERSTOCK AND OTHER MERCHANDISE.

OTHER ACTIVITIES

THE COMPANY ALSO PRODUCES AND LICENSES ITS

ANIMATION CEL ART AS WELL AS PRODUCES, MARKETS AND DISTRIBUTES

OTHER ANIMATION-RELATED ARTWORK AND COLLECTIBLES.

COMPETITION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

PROTECTION

THE COMPANY COMPETES IN ITS CHARACTER

MERCHANDISING AND OTHER LICENSING, PUBLISHING, INTERACTIVE AND

RETAIL ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER LICENSORS, PUBLISHERS AND RETAILERS

OF CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES. ALTHOUGH PUBLIC

INFORMATION IS LIMITED, WE BELIEVE THE COMPANY IS THE LARGEST

WORLDWIDE LICENSOR OF CHARACTER-BASED MERCHANDISE AND

PRODUCER/DISTRIBUTOR OF CHILDRENS FILM-RELATED PRODUCTS.

OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE LICENSING AND RETAIL DISTRIBUTION

BUSINESS ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR

AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF ANIMATED THEATRICAL

RELEASES.

THE COMPANYS LICENSING BUSINESSES, AS WELL

AS ITS STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT AND THEME PARK AND RESORT

OPERATIONS, ARE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

EXPLOIT AND PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING

TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS AND TRADE SECRETS,

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AS A RESULT, DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LAWS

PROMOTING OR LIMITING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY HAVE

SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON SOME OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. IN

THE UNITED STATES, FOR EXAMPLE, THE 1998 SONNY BONO COPYRIGHT

TERM EXTENSION ACT PROVIDED EXTENDED COPYRIGHT PROTECTION FOR

CERTAIN OLDER PROPERTIES CURRENTLY LICENSED OR OTHERWISE

EXPLOITED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH OTHERWISE MIGHT LOSE SUCH

PROTECTION IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE CONSTITUTIONALITY OF THIS ACT

HAS BEEN CHALLENGED, HOWEVER, AND ITS VALIDITY IS CURRENTLY

UNDER REVIEW BY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT. IF THE ACT IS

OVERTURNED, THE COMPANY WOULD HAVE SHORTER COPYRIGHT PROTECTION

FOR ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES, ALTHOUGH IN MANY CASES

TRADEMARK OR OTHER PROTECTIONS MIGHT STILL BE AVAILABLE.

COPYRIGHT AND TRADEMARK PROTECTIONS ARE LIMITED

OR EVEN UNAVAILABLE IN SOME FOREIGN COUNTRIES, AND PREVENTING

UNAUTHORIZED USE OF THE COMPANYS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES

CAN BE DIFFICULT EVEN IN COUNTRIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL LEGAL

PROTECTIONS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGIES HAVE FACILITATED

PIRACY OF THE COMPANYS COPYRIGHTED WORKS, INCLUDING MOTION

PICTURES, TELEVISION PROGRAMMING AND SOUND RECORDINGS, BY SUCH

MEANS AS INTERNET PEER-TO-PEER FILE SHARING AND PERSONAL VIDEO

RECORDERS THAT PERMIT AD STRIPPING AND THE UNAUTHORIZED COPYING

OF MOTION PICTURES AND TELEVISION PROGRAMS. THE COMPANY DEVOTES

SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO PROTECTING ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTIES

IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER KEY WORLD MARKETS.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES THAT

RELY ON THE EXPLOITATION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ARE SUBJECT TO

THE RISK OF CHALLENGES BY THIRD PARTIES CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT OF

THEIR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. IRRESPECTIVE OF THEIR VALIDITY, SUCH

CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERSION OF

RESOURCES, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR OPERATIONS.

THE COMPANY AND THE PLAINTIFFS SETTLED THIS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED

LAWSUIT, WHICH THE PLAINTIFFS BROUGHT IN 1997 IN THE CIRCUIT

COURT FOR ORANGE COUNTY, FLORIDA.

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY

COMPANY.

IN THIS LAWSUIT, FILED ON

FEBRUARY 27, 1991 AND PENDING IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY

SUPERIOR COURT, THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT A COMPANY SUBSIDIARY

DEFRAUDED IT AND BREACHED A 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH

RESPECT TO CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH PROPERTIES, BY FAILING TO

ACCOUNT FOR AND PAY ROYALTIES ON REVENUES EARNED FROM THE SALE

OF WINNIE THE POOH MOVIES ON VIDEOCASSETTE AND FROM THE

EXPLOITATION OF WINNIE THE POOH MERCHANDISING RIGHTS. THE

PLAINTIFF SEEKS DAMAGES FOR THE LICENSEES ALLEGED BREACHES

AS WELL AS CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAINTIFFS INTERPRETATION

OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE ACTIVITIES.

THE PLAINTIFF ALSO SEEKS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT ON

THE BASIS OF THE ALLEGED BREACHES. THE COMPANY DISPUTES THAT THE

PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER RELIEF OF ANY

KIND, INCLUDING TERMINATION OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT. THE

CLAIM IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN MARCH 2003. IF EACH OF

THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS WERE TO BE CONFIRMED IN A FINAL

JUDGMENT, DAMAGES AS ARGUED BY THE PLAINTIFF COULD TOTAL AS MUCH

AS SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE

VALUE TO THE COMPANY OF ANY FUTURE EXPLOITATION OF THE LICENSED

RIGHTS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES AND THE

UNCERTAINTY OF THEIR ULTIMATE DISPOSITION, MANAGEMENT IS UNABLE

TO PREDICT THE MAGNITUDE OF ANY POTENTIAL DETERMINATION OF THE

PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS.

DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, UNDER UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT LAW, THAT

MS. MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE VALID; THAT

SSIS RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH IN THE UNITED STATES WILL

TERMINATE EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004; THAT UPON TERMINATION

NET INCOME FOR THE YEAR WAS $1.2 BILLION,

COMMON STOCK WERE $1.2 BILLION AND $0.60, RESPECTIVELY, FOR

THE CURRENT YEAR, COMPARED TO A NET LOSS AND LOSS PER SHARE OF

$41 MILLION AND $0.02 IN THE PRIOR YEAR. RESULTS FOR THE

CURRENT YEAR INCLUDE A PRE-TAX GAIN ($216 MILLION OR $0.07

PER SHARE) ON THE SALE OF THE REMAINING SHARES OF KNIGHT-RIDDER,

INC., A PRE-TAX GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE DISNEY STORE BUSINESS IN

JAPAN ($34 MILLION OR $0.01 PER SHARE), OPERATIONS OF ABC

FAMILY ACQUIRED ON OCTOBER 24, 2001, INCREMENTAL INTEREST

EXPENSE FOR BORROWINGS RELATED TO THAT ACQUISITION AND THE

CESSATION OF AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, DUE TO THE ADOPTION OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL STANDARDS

NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(SFAS 142) EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2001. THE PRIOR YEAR

INCLUDED RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ($1.5 BILLION

CHANGES ($278 MILLION OR $0.13 PER SHARE). EARNINGS AND

EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTED TO DISNEY COMMON STOCK BEFORE THE

OF SFAS 142 FOR THE PRIOR-YEAR WERE $891 MILLION AND

$0.42, RESPECTIVELY.

EXCLUDING THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACT OF THE

NON-RECURRING ITEMS DISCUSSED ABOVE, RESULTS FOR THE YEAR WERE

DRIVEN BY LOWER SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AND EQUITY IN INCOME OF

INVESTEES AND HIGHER NET INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER. DECREASED

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME REFLECTED LOWER MEDIA NETWORKS AND

PARKS AND RESORTS RESULTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER STUDIO

ENTERTAINMENT RESULTS. LOWER EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES

REFLECTED THE WRITE-DOWN OF AN INVESTMENT IN A LATIN AMERICAN

CABLE OPERATOR, DECREASES AT THE CABLE INVESTMENTS RESULTING

FROM THE SOFT ADVERTISING MARKET AND HIGHER ADVERTISING COSTS AT

LIFETIME TELEVISION.

INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED TO $723 MILLION

DUE TO INCREMENTAL BORROWINGS IN CONNECTION WITH THE ABC FAMILY

ACQUISITION. HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASED INVESTMENT INCOME DUE TO THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF

KNIGHT-RIDDER SHARES.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED FROM 82.5% IN

FISCAL 2001 TO 38.9% IN FISCAL 2002 DUE TO NONDEDUCTIBLE

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS TAKEN IN FISCAL

2001, AND THE CESSATION OF NONDEDUCTIBLE AMORTIZATION OF

GOODWILL IN FISCAL 2002.

2001 VS. 2000

AS-REPORTED NET LOSS WAS $158 MILLION

COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $920 MILLION IN FISCAL 2000. NET

LOSS AND LOSS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTED TO DISNEY COMMON STOCK WERE

$41 MILLION AND $0.02, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO NET INCOME

AND EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTED TO DISNEY COMMON STOCK OF

$1.2 BILLION AND $0.57, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

AS-REPORTED NET LOSS IN FISCAL 2001 INCLUDES CHARGES FROM THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES ($278 MILLION OR

$0.13 PER DISNEY SHARE) AND RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

($1.5 BILLION OR $0.52 PER DISNEY SHARE). AS-REPORTED

RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE PRE-TAX GAINS ON THE SALE OF INFOSEEK JAPAN

K.K. ($22 MILLION) IN FISCAL 2001, AND FAIRCHILD

PUBLICATIONS ($243 MILLION), ULTRASEEK CORPORATION

($153 MILLION) AND EUROSPORT ($93 MILLION) IN FISCAL

2000.

EXCLUDING THE CHARGES AND GAINS MENTIONED ABOVE,

EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTED TO DISNEY COMMON STOCK WAS $0.63

AND $0.56 FOR THE FISCAL 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS

FOR FISCAL 2001 ALSO REFLECTED LOWER AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE

ASSETS AND NET INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER, AND HIGHER EQUITY IN

THE INCOME OF INVESTEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED SEGMENT

OPERATING INCOME AND HIGHER CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED

EXPENSES. LOWER AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS REFLECTED THE

WRITE-OFF OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSURE OF

THE GO.COM PORTAL BUSINESS IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2001,

CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2001 AND A REDUCTION IN INTANGIBLE ASSETS

RELATED TO THE SALE OF FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS, ULTRASEEK AND

EUROSPORT IN FISCAL 2000. DECREASES IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE AND

OTHER WERE DUE TO LOWER INTEREST RATES AND LOWER AVERAGE DEBT

BALANCES THROUGHOUT MOST OF FISCAL 2001, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASED INVESTMENT INCOME DUE TO GAINS ON THE SALE OF CERTAIN

INVESTMENTS. HIGHER EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES REFLECTED

IMPROVED RESULTS FROM CABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS INCLUDING

LIFETIME TELEVISION, THE HISTORY CHANNEL AND A&E TELEVISION

AND CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL CABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY START-UP LOSSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH NEW

INVESTMENTS. DECREASED SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME REFLECTED LOWER

MEDIA NETWORKS AND PARKS AND RESORTS RESULTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY IMPROVEMENTS AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS.

INCREASED CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES WERE DRIVEN

BY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL STRATEGIC INITIATIVES DESIGNED

TO IMPROVE OVERALL COMPANY-WIDE EFFICIENCY AND PROMOTE THE

DISNEY BRAND.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCREASED FROM 61.0% IN

FISCAL 2000 TO 82.5% IN FISCAL 2001 PRIMARILY DUE TO

NONDEDUCTIBLE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS

TAKEN IN FISCAL 2001.

ON A PRO FORMA BASIS, REVENUES DECREASED 4%, OR

$394 MILLION, TO $9.8 BILLION, REFLECTING A DECREASE

OF 15%, OR $881 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY AN INCREASE OF 12%, OR $487 MILLION, AT THE CABLE

NETWORKS. THE DECREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DRIVEN BY DECLINES AT

THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND THE COMPANYS OWNED

TELEVISION STATIONS DUE TO LOWER RATINGS AND LOWER ADVERTISING

RATES. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED REVENUES FROM A

NON-RECURRING SALE OF A FILM LIBRARY AT ABC FAMILY.

INCREASES AT THE CABLE NETWORKS WERE DRIVEN BY HIGHER AFFILIATE

REVENUES REFLECTING HIGHER RATES AT ESPN AND SUBSCRIBER GROWTH

AT BOTH ESPN AND THE INTERNATIONAL DISNEY CHANNELS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY LOWER ADVERTISING REVENUES DUE TO THE SOFT ADVERTISING

MARKET AND LOWER REVENUES FROM ADELPHIA COMMUNICATIONS COMPANY

(ADELPHIA) IN THE UNITED STATES AND KIRCHMEDIA &

COMPANY (KIRCH) IN GERMANY AS A RESULT OF THEIR FINANCIAL

DIFFICULTIES.

ON A PRO FORMA BASIS, SEGMENT OPERATING

INCOME DECREASED 49%, OR $959 MILLION, TO

$1.0 BILLION, DRIVEN BY DECREASES OF $819 MILLION AT

BROADCASTING, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED REVENUES. CABLE

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 12%, OR $140 MILLION, AS REVENUE

GAINS WERE MORE THAN OFFSET BY COST INCREASES. COSTS AND

EXPENSES INCREASED 7%, OR $565 MILLION, DRIVEN BY HIGHER

SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS AT ESPN, PRINCIPALLY FOR NFL

BROADCASTS, AND INCREASED ADVERTISING COSTS AT THE CABLE

NETWORKS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COSTS AT THE INTERNET GROUP

AND PROCEEDS FROM AN INSURANCE SETTLEMENT.

AS-REPORTED REVENUES INCREASED 2%, OR

$164 MILLION, TO $9.7 BILLION AND SEGMENT OPERATING

INCOME DECREASED 44% TO $1.0 BILLION. AS-REPORTED AMOUNTS

INCLUDE A PARTIAL PERIOD OF ABC FAMILY OPERATIONS IN THE CURRENT

PERIOD AND LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE GO.COM PORTAL (WHICH WAS

CLOSED ON JANUARY 29, 2001) IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD.

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS

FOR THE PURCHASE OF BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR SPORTS AND OTHER

PROGRAMMING, INCLUDING THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE (NFL),

NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION (NBA), MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL

(MLB), NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE (NHL) AND VARIOUS COLLEGE

FOOTBALL CONFERENCE AND BOWL GAMES. THE COSTS OF THESE CONTRACTS

HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. WE HAVE

IMPLEMENTED A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES, INCLUDING MARKETING

EFFORTS, TO REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THE HIGHER COSTS. THE IMPACT OF

THESE CONTRACTS ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OVER THE REMAINING

TERM OF THE CONTRACTS IS DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF

MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES.

THE COSTS OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE CHARGED TO

EXPENSE BASED ON THE RATIO OF EACH PERIODS GROSS REVENUES

TO ESTIMATED TOTAL GROSS REVENUES OVER THE REMAINING CONTRACT

PERIOD. THE COMPANYS CONTRACT TO BROADCAST THE NFL IS FOR

AN EIGHT YEAR TERM COMMENCING WITH THE 1998 SEASON. THE INITIAL

FIVE YEAR PERIOD IS NON-CANCELABLE WITH THE REMAINING THREE

YEARS RENEWABLE AT THE OPTION OF THE NFL. PROGRAMMING RIGHTS

COSTS FOR THE INITIAL FIVE YEAR PERIOD HAVE BEEN CHARGED TO

EXPENSE BASED UPON THE RATIO OF CURRENT PERIODS GROSS

REVENUES TO ESTIMATED TOTAL REVENUES FOR THIS PERIOD OF TIME.

ESTIMATES OF TOTAL GROSS REVENUES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY AND,

ACCORDINGLY, THEY ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND AMORTIZATION AND

CARRYING AMOUNTS ARE ADJUSTED, IF NECESSARY. SUCH ADJUSTMENTS

COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

NOTE: OPERATING INCOME FROM CABLE TELEVISION

ACTIVITIES PRESENTED IN THIS TABLE REPRESENTS 100% OF BOTH THE

COMPANYS OWNED CABLE BUSINESSES AND ITS CABLE EQUITY

INVESTEES. THE DISNEY SHARE OF OPERATING INCOME REPRESENTS THE

COMPANYS OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN CABLE TELEVISION OPERATING

INCOME. CABLE NETWORKS ARE REPORTED IN SEGMENT OPERATING

INCOME IN THE STATEMENTS OF INCOME. EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE

REPORTED IN EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES IN THE

STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

WE BELIEVE THAT OPERATING INCOME FROM CABLE

TELEVISION ACTIVITIES PROVIDES ADDITIONAL INFORMATION USEFUL IN

ANALYZING THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS RESULTS. HOWEVER, OPERATING

INCOME FROM CABLE TELEVISION ACTIVITIES IS A NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

METRIC AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A

SUBSTITUTE FOR, SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME.

THE COMPANYS SHARE OF CABLE TELEVISION

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 15%, OR $197 MILLION, TO

$1.1 BILLION. THE DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER REVENUES DUE

TO THE WEAK ADVERTISING MARKET AT BOTH ESPN AND THE CABLE EQUITY

AFFILIATES, HIGHER SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS AT ESPN AND HIGHER

ADVERTISING EXPENSE AT THE CABLE EQUITY AFFILIATES, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN. ADDITIONALLY, THE

CURRENT PERIOD REFLECTS THE WRITE-DOWN OF AN INVESTMENT IN A

LATIN AMERICAN CABLE OPERATOR.

2001 VS. 2000

ON AN AS-REPORTED BASIS, REVENUES DECREASED 3%,

OR $267 MILLION, TO $9.6 BILLION, DRIVEN BY DECREASES

OF $601 MILLION AT BROADCASTING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASES OF $334 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS. THE

DECREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER RATINGS AND THE

SOFT ADVERTISING MARKET AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND THE

COMPANYS OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO OPERATIONS.

ADDITIONALLY, REVENUE DECLINES AT THE TELEVISION NETWORK

REFLECTED LOWER SPORTS ADVERTISING REVENUES DUE TO ABC AIRING

THE SUPER BOWL IN FISCAL 2000. THE INCREASE AT THE CABLE

NETWORKS WAS DRIVEN BY ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL RATE ADJUSTMENTS AT

ESPN COMBINED WITH SUBSCRIBER GROWTH AT ESPN, THE DISNEY CHANNEL

DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SOFT

ADVERTISING MARKET DURING FISCAL 2001. SUBSCRIBER GROWTH AT THE

DISNEY CHANNEL REFLECTED INCREASING SATELLITE (DBS) AND

DIGITAL SUBSCRIBERS AND THE CONTINUING CONVERSION OF THE DISNEY

CHANNEL FROM A PREMIUM TO A BASIC SERVICE.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 11%, OR

$227 MILLION, TO $1.8 BILLION, DRIVEN BY A DECREASE OF

$275 MILLION AT BROADCASTING RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM

DECREASED REVENUES AND HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $48 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS,

DRIVEN BY REVENUE GROWTH. COSTS AND EXPENSES DECREASED 1%, OR

$40 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2001, BUT INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE

OF REVENUE. THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS AT

ESPN, THE PRIMETIME ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND THE

COMPANYS OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO OPERATIONS

AND START-UP COSTS AT THE INTERNATIONAL DISNEY CHANNELS, OFFSET

BY LOWER SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK

2002 VS. 2001

REVENUES DECREASED 8%, OR $539 MILLION, TO

$6.5 BILLION, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY DECREASES OF

$496 MILLION AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT,

$40 MILLION AT THE DISNEYLAND RESORT AND $24 MILLION

AT DISNEY CRUISE LINE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED ROYALTIES

OF $52 MILLION FROM THE TOKYO DISNEY RESORT. AT THE WALT

DISNEY WORLD RESORT, DECREASED REVENUES REFLECTED LOWER

ATTENDANCE, GUEST SPENDING AND HOTEL OCCUPANCY DRIVEN BY

DECREASES IN INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC VISITATION RESULTING

FROM CONTINUED DISRUPTION IN TRAVEL AND TOURISM AND SOFTNESS IN

THE ECONOMY. AT THE DISNEYLAND RESORT, DECREASED REVENUES WERE

DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOWER GUEST SPENDING. LOWER GUEST SPENDING

AT BOTH WALT DISNEY WORLD AND DISNEYLAND WAS DRIVEN BY TICKET

AND OTHER PROMOTIONAL PROGRAMS AS WELL AS A HIGHER MIX OF LOCAL

GUESTS, WHO HAVE HIGHER ANNUAL PASS USAGE AND TEND TO SPEND LESS

PER VISIT. THE INCREASED ROYALTIES AT TOKYO DISNEY RESORT WERE

DUE TO THE OPENING OF THE TOKYO DISNEYSEA THEME PARK AND THE

TOKYO DISNEYSEA HOTEL MIRA COSTA IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE

PRIOR YEAR.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 26%, OR

$417 MILLION, TO $1.2 BILLION, DRIVEN BY REVENUE

WHICH CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF LABOR, COSTS OF MERCHANDISE, FOOD

AND BEVERAGES SOLD, DEPRECIATION, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE,

ENTERTAINMENT AND MARKETING AND SALES EXPENSE, DECREASED 2%, OR

$122 MILLION, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY VOLUME DECREASES, REDUCED

MARKETING EXPENSES AND PERMANENT COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES

ACROSS ALL SEGMENT BUSINESSES AND THE ABSENCE OF PRE-OPENING

COSTS FOR DISNEYS CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE. THESE COST

DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT AND

INSURANCE COSTS.

2001 VS. 2000

REVENUES INCREASED 3%, OR $195 MILLION, TO

$7.0 BILLION, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY GROWTH OF

$278 MILLION AT THE DISNEYLAND RESORT, $44 MILLION

FROM TOKYO DISNEYLAND, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF

$187 MILLION AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT. AT THE

DISNEYLAND RESORT, THE OPENING OF DISNEYS CALIFORNIA

ADVENTURE, DOWNTOWN DISNEY AND DISNEYS GRAND CALIFORNIAN

HOTEL DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2001 DROVE INCREASED

ATTENDANCE, HIGHER OCCUPIED ROOM NIGHTS AND INCREASED GUEST

SPENDING. AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT, DECREASED REVENUES

WERE DRIVEN BY DECREASED ATTENDANCE AND LOWER OCCUPIED ROOM

NIGHTS REFLECTING FISCAL 2000 SUCCESS OF THE MILLENNIUM

CELEBRATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED GUEST SPENDING AND

INCREASED REVENUES AT DISNEY CRUISE LINE REFLECTING THE STRENGTH

OF THE 7-DAY CRUISE PACKAGE THAT WAS INTRODUCED IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2000. BOTH THE DISNEYLAND RESORT AND WALT

DISNEY WORLD RESORT WERE IMPACTED BY PARK CLOSURES ON

ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND ESPN, AN EIGHT YEAR CONTRACT FOR NFL

BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR VARIOUS FEATURE FILMS, SPORTS AND OTHER

PROGRAMMING.

OVER THE PAST YEAR, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAVE

OCCURRED IN THE COMMERCIAL INSURANCE MARKET WHICH ARE IMPACTING

THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE

COVERAGE. THE COMPANY HAS SUCCESSFULLY RENEWED ALL OF OUR

SIGNIFICANT POLICIES IN THIS CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, THOUGH THE

PREMIUMS AND DEDUCTIBLES HAVE INCREASED. DURING THE THIRD

QUARTER OF THE CURRENT YEAR, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A WHOLLY

OWNED CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANY TO INSURE CERTAIN COMPONENTS OF

LOSS EXPOSURE WHICH WERE PREVIOUSLY INSURED BY THIRD PARTY

INSURANCE COMPANIES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANYS RISK OF

LOSS HAS INCREASED.

AS DISCLOSED IN THE NOTES 8 AND 14 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR

CERTAIN LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS

CURRENTLY NOT POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE

ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE ON THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.

AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO

INCLUDES COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENTS MADE

BETWEEN 1992 AND 1994 TOTALING $289 MILLION, WHICH ARE

DIVERSIFIED ACROSS THREE AIR CARRIERS (UNITED

AIRLINES  $114 MILLION, DELTA

AIRLINES  $119 MILLION, AND FEDEX 

$56 MILLION) AND ELEVEN AIRCRAFT. RISK OF LOSS UNDER THESE

TRANSACTIONS IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE ABILITY OF THE AIR

CARRIERS TO MAKE UNDERLYING LEASE PAYMENTS.

WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR INVESTMENT IN

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT LEASING TRANSACTIONS GIVEN THE CURRENT

STATUS OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. WE HAVE, IN PARTICULAR, BEEN

MONITORING UNITED AIRLINES, WHICH HAS INDICATED THAT IF IT DOES

NOT OBTAIN SIGNIFICANT CONCESSIONS FROM EACH OF ITS EMPLOYEE

UNIONS,

-36-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS IN OTHER OPERATING AREAS OF

THE COMPANY AND OBTAIN A LOAN GUARANTEE FROM THE AIRLINE

TRANSPORTATION STABILIZATION BOARD, IT WILL HAVE TO FILE FOR

BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION. TO DATE, ALL PAYMENTS ON THESE LEASES

HAVE BEEN MADE WHEN DUE. THE INABILITY OF ANY OF THE COMPANIES

TO MAKE THEIR LEASE PAYMENTS OR THE TERMINATION OF OUR LEASES

THROUGH A BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL CHARGES

RELATED TO A WRITE-DOWN OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR INVESTMENT AND

COULD ACCELERATE INCOME TAX PAYMENTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION

IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH, OTHER LIQUID ASSETS, OPERATING CASH

FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND BORROWING

CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO FUND

ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPMENT

OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS OPERATING CASH FLOW

AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAN BE IMPACTED BY

MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL. IN ADDITION TO

MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE COMPANYS BORROWING COSTS CAN BE

IMPACTED BY SHORT-AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY

INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT

PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CERTAIN

CREDIT MEASURES SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS.

ON OCTOBER 4, 2002, STANDARD & POORS RATINGS

SERVICES LOWERED ITS LONG-TERM RATINGS ON THE COMPANY TO BBB+

FROM A- AND REMOVED THE COMPANYS RATINGS FROM CREDITWATCH

WHERE THEY WERE PLACED WITH NEGATIVE IMPLICATIONS ON

AUGUST 2, 2002. AT THE SAME TIME, THE A-2 SHORT-TERM

CORPORATE CREDIT RATING, WHICH WAS NOT ON CREDITWATCH, WAS

AFFIRMED. THE CURRENT OUTLOOK IS STABLE. ON OCTOBER 18,

2002, MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE DOWNGRADED THE

COMPANYS LONG-TERM DEBT RATING TO BAA1 FROM A3, CONCLUDING

THE REVIEW FOR POSSIBLE DOWNGRADE THAT COMMENCED ON

AUGUST 5, 2002. THE COMPANYS SHORT-TERM RATING OF P2

WAS AFFIRMED AND THE OUTLOOK IS STABLE.

OTHER MATTERS

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL

POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT. FOR A SUMMARY

OF ALL OF OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING

POLICIES DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE NOTE 2 OF THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND

COSTS

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF FILM AND TELEVISION

PRODUCTION AND PARTICIPATIONS AS WELL AS MULTI-YEAR SPORTS

RIGHTS OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON THE

RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO THE

ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS REVENUES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE

CALCULATED ON AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION BASIS FOR FILM AND

TELEVISION AND ON AN INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT BASIS FOR SPORTS

RIGHTS. ESTIMATES OF TOTAL GROSS REVENUES CAN CHANGE DUE TO A

VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE,

ADVERTISING RATES AND SUBSCRIBER FEES.

TELEVISION NETWORK AND STATION RIGHTS FOR

THEATRICAL MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS ARE CHARGED TO

EXPENSE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO

BE SHOWN. ESTIMATES OF USAGE OF TELEVISION NETWORK AND STATION

PROGRAMMING CAN CHANGE BASED ON COMPETITION AND AUDIENCE

ACCEPTANCE. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE ESTIMATES AND PLANNED USAGE ARE

REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND ARE REVISED IF NECESSARY. A CHANGE IN

REVENUE PROJECTIONS OR PLANNED USAGE COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND

PROGRAMMING COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS PURSUANT

TO THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING RULES. THE VALUES OF THE TELEVISION

PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A DAYPART

METHODOLOGY. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE: EARLY MORNING,

DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIME TIME, NEWS, CHILDREN AND SPORTS. A

DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST

DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE.

ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND

AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL DEMAND OR MARKET

-37-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR

PROJECTIONS, POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT FILM, TELEVISION OR

PROGRAMMING COST WRITE-DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR

ITS VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE

CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH BUSINESS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THESE REVENUE

RECOGNITION POLICIES.

WE RECORD REDUCTIONS TO REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED

FUTURE RETURNS OF MERCHANDISE, PRIMARILY HOME VIDEO, DVD AND

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, AND FOR CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND SALES

INCENTIVES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL RETURN

EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS OF CUSTOMER

DEMAND FOR AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. DIFFERENCES MAY

RESULT IN THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF OUR REVENUE FOR ANY PERIOD IF

ACTUAL PERFORMANCE VARIES FROM OUR ESTIMATES.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-LIVED ASSETS

AND INVESTMENTS

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2001, WE ADOPTED

SFAS 142, AS DESCRIBED MORE FULLY IN NOTE 2 OF THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SFAS 142 REQUIRES THAT

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT

WITHIN SIX MONTHS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION AND THEN ON A

PERIODIC BASIS THEREAFTER. DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE CURRENT

FISCAL YEAR, WE COMPLETED OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING AND DETERMINED

THAT THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RELATED TO GOODWILL AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. ON OCTOBER 1, 2002, WE UPDATED OUR

IMPAIRMENT TEST AND DETERMINED THAT THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT. IN

ASSESSING THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, PROJECTIONS REGARDING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND

OTHER FACTORS ARE MADE TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

RESPECTIVE ASSETS. IF THESE ESTIMATES OR RELATED PROJECTIONS

CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES FOR THESE ASSETS.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS INCLUDE CERTAIN LONG-TERM

INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE LONG-TERM INVESTMENTS IS

DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANIES WE INVEST IN, AS

WELL AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE

INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT FOR THESE

INVESTMENTS, WE WILL CONSIDER THESE FACTORS AS WELL AS

FORECASTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTEES. IF THESE

FORECASTS ARE NOT MET, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.

CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED OUR ESTIMATE OF THE

PROBABLE COSTS FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS. THIS ESTIMATE

HAS BEEN DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND IS

BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A

COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. IT IS

POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY

PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY

AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE PROCEEDINGS. SEE NOTE 14 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION

ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.

INCOME TAX AUDITS

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY

AUDITED BY BOTH FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM

TIME TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. AMONG

CURRENT AUDITS, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) IS IN

THE FINAL STAGES OF ITS EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANYS

FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 1993 THROUGH 1995. IN CONNECTION

WITH THIS EXAMINATION, THE IRS HAS PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS THAT

CHALLENGE CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS TAX POSITIONS WHICH, IF

UPHELD THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PROCESS, COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS TAX POSITIONS COMPLY WITH

APPLICABLE TAX LAW AND IT INTENDS TO DEFEND ITS POSITIONS

VIGOROUSLY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS ADEQUATELY PROVIDED FOR

ANY REASONABLY FORESEEABLE OUTCOME RELATED TO THESE MATTERS, AND

IT DOES NOT ANTICIPATE ANY MATERIAL EARNINGS IMPACT FROM THEIR

ULTIMATE RESOLUTION. DURING 2002, THE COMPANY NEGOTIATED THE

SETTLEMENT OF A NUMBER OF PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS, AND IT CONTINUES

TO PURSUE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT OF THE REMAINING ITEMS. SEE

EXPOSURE.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

IN JULY 2001, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 141,

BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS

(SFAS 141), WHICH REQUIRES THAT ALL

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001 BE

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD. SFAS 141

SUPERSEDED APB OPINION NO. 16,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS,

AND STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 38,

ACCOUNTING FOR PREACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES OF PURCHASED

ENTERPRISES

AND IS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001.

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2001, THE COMPANY

ADOPTED SFAS 142 WHICH ADDRESSES THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

AND REPORTING FOR ACQUIRED GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS 142, GOODWILL AND A

SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE

NO LONGER AMORTIZED. PURSUANT TO SFAS 142, INTANGIBLE

ASSETS MUST BE PERIODICALLY TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT, AND THE NEW

STANDARD PROVIDES SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANY COMPLETED

ITS IMPAIRMENT REVIEW, WHICH INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO

IMPAIRMENT. SEE NOTE 6 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

THE FASB ALSO ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR OBLIGATIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

(SFAS 143) IN AUGUST 2001, WHICH ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS FOR THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF AN ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATION AND ITS ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT COST.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 143 WILL

NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION UPON ADOPTION. THE COMPANY

PLANS TO ADOPT SFAS 143 EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2002.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 144

, ACCOUNTING FOR THE

IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

(SFAS 144)

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2001, WHICH DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL POSITION. SFAS 144 ESTABLISHES A SINGLE

ACCOUNTING MODEL FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS, INCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

IN JUNE 2002, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 146,

ACCOUNTING FOR

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

(SFAS 146). SFAS 146 REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR

A COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITY BE

RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. SFAS 146

REQUIRES THAT THE INITIAL MEASUREMENT OF A LIABILITY BE AT FAIR

VALUE. SFAS 146 WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR EXIT OR DISPOSAL

ACTIVITIES THAT ARE INITIATED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002 WITH

EARLY ADOPTION ENCOURAGED. THE COMPANY PLANS TO ADOPT

SFAS 146 EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2002 AND DOES NOT EXPECT

THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2000, THE COMPANY

ADOPTED AICPA STATEMENT OF POSITION NO. 00-2,

ACCOUNTING

BY PRODUCERS OR DISTRIBUTORS OF FILMS

(SOP 00-2). THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION

REFLECT THE IMPACT OF THE NEW STANDARD COMMENCING

OCTOBER 1, 2000 AND THE COMPANY RECORDED A ONE-TIME

AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $228 MILLION, OR $0.11 PER SHARE,

REPRESENTING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION OF

SOP 00-2 IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE

YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001.

IN JUNE 1998, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS NO. 133

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

(SFAS 133), SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED

BY SFAS NO. 137 AND SFAS NO. 138.

SFAS 133 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO RECORD ALL DERIVATIVES ON

THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN DERIVATIVE FAIR

VALUES WILL EITHER BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS OFFSETS TO THE

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF RELATED HEDGED ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND

FIRM COMMITMENTS OR, FOR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, DEFERRED AND

RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (AOCI) UNTIL THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS OCCUR AND ARE

-39-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION

OF A HEDGING DERIVATIVES CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE WILL BE

IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS 133 AS OF

OCTOBER 1, 2000, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRANSITION

PROVISIONS, THE COMPANY RECORDED A ONE-TIME AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF

$50 MILLION, OR $0.02 PER SHARE, IN ITS CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME REPRESENTING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE

ADOPTION AND AN AFTER-TAX UNREALIZED GAIN OF $60 MILLION TO

AOCI.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF

1995 PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE

BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE

WRITTEN OR ORAL STATEMENTS THAT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING,

INCLUDING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER FILINGS

WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND IN REPORTS TO

OUR STOCKHOLDERS. SUCH STATEMENTS MAY, FOR EXAMPLE, EXPRESS

EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE ACTIONS THAT WE MAY

TAKE, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING OR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OR ABOUT

DEVELOPMENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL INCLUDING CHANGES IN DOMESTIC OR

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE MADE ON THE

BASIS OF MANAGEMENTS VIEWS AND ASSUMPTIONS AS OF THE TIME

THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER,

THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WILL NECESSARILY COME TO PASS.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS.

FOR AN ENTERPRISE AS LARGE

AND COMPLEX AS THE COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS COULD

MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING

THE FOLLOWING.

CHANGES IN COMPANY-WIDE OR BUSINESS-UNIT

STRATEGIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN CHANGES IN THE TYPES OR MIX OF

BUSINESSES IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED OR CHOOSES TO INVEST;

CHANGES IN U.S., GLOBAL OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY AFFECT ATTENDANCE AND SPENDING AT THE

COMPANYS PARKS AND RESORTS, PURCHASES OF COMPANY-LICENSED

CONSUMER PRODUCTS, THE ADVERTISING MARKET FOR BROADCAST AND

CABLE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE

COMPANYS THEATRICAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT RELEASES;

CHANGES IN U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND EQUITY

MARKETS, INCLUDING MARKET DISRUPTIONS AND SIGNIFICANT INTEREST

RATE FLUCTUATIONS, WHICH MAY IMPEDE THE COMPANYS ACCESS

TO, OR INCREASE THE COST OF, EXTERNAL FINANCING FOR ITS

OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS;

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, BOTH

DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, WHICH MAY, AMONG OTHER THINGS,

AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANYS PARKS AND RESORTS

OPERATIONS AND LEAD TO INCREASED EXPENSES IN SUCH AREAS AS

TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ACQUISITION AND MOTION PICTURE PRODUCTION

AND MARKETING;

LEGAL AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY AFFECT

PARTICULAR BUSINESS UNITS, SUCH AS REGULATORY ACTIONS AFFECTING

ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES, CONSUMER PRODUCTS, THEME PARK SAFETY,

BROADCASTING OR INTERNET ACTIVITIES OR THE PROTECTION OF

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; THE IMPOSITION BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES OF

TRADE RESTRICTIONS OR MOTION PICTURE OR TELEVISION CONTENT

REQUIREMENTS OR QUOTAS, AND CHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL TAX LAWS OR

CURRENCY CONTROLS;

ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR NATURAL DISASTERS,

SUCH AS HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES, WHICH MAY, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, IMPAIR PERFORMANCE AT THE COMPANYS PARKS AND

RESORTS;

TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY AFFECT THE

DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANYS CREATIVE PRODUCTS OR CREATE

NEW RISKS TO THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO PROTECT ITS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY;

LABOR DISPUTES, WHICH MAY LEAD TO INCREASED COSTS

OR DISRUPTION OF OPERATIONS IN ANY OF THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS UNITS;

CHANGING PUBLIC AND CONSUMER TASTE, WHICH MAY

AMONG OTHER THINGS, AFFECT THE COMPANYS ENTERTAINMENT,

BROADCASTING AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS BUSINESSES GENERALLY OR THE

COMPANYS

-40-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PARKS AND RESORTS OPERATING SPECIFICALLY, OR

RESULT IN INCREASES IN BROADCASTING LOSSES OR LOSS OF

INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL AND MILITARY

DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY AFFECT AMONG OTHER THINGS, TRAVEL AND

LEISURE BUSINESSES GENERALLY OR THE COMPANYS PARKS AND

RESORTS OPERATIONS SPECIFICALLY, OR RESULT IN INCREASES IN

BROADCASTING COSTS OR LOSS OF ADVERTISING REVENUE.

THIS LIST OF FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE

PERFORMANCE AND THE ACCURACY OF FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IS

ILLUSTRATIVE, BUT BY NO MEANS EXHAUSTIVE. ACCORDINGLY, ALL

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SHOULD BE EVALUATED WITH THE

UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR INHERENT UNCERTAINTY.

ITEM 7A. MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST

RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE

MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY

EMPLOYS ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE ITS

EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND

THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND

EQUITY SECURITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST

RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON

EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO

ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS

TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS

FIXED RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN A

MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE, WHICH IS SET BY POLICY.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW

VOLATILITY IN ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE

BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS

INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN

CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED FOREIGN

CURRENCY REVENUES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTION STRATEGIES AND

FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE SALE OF FOREIGN

CURRENCIES TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED,

REVENUES. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE

FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN THE SAME PRINCIPAL

CURRENCIES. THE PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE EUROPEAN EURO,

BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. BY POLICY, THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM

PERCENTAGES OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES

GENERALLY FOR PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS. THE GAINS AND

LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE

RELATED EXPOSURES.

IN ADDITION, WE USE VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

TO MINIMIZE THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FAIR MARKET VALUE OF

CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES.

IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ENTER INTO

FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO

MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER

INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

VALUE AT RISK

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VALUE-AT-RISK

(VAR) MODEL TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND

QUALIFYING EQUITY SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL

ESTIMATES WERE MADE ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95%

CONFIDENCE LEVEL. VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED IN A

VAR COMPUTATION. THE COMPANYS COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON

THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS INTEREST

RATES, CURRENCIES AND EQUITY PRICES (A VARIANCE/

CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS WERE

DETERMINED BY OBSERVING INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY AND

EQUITY MARKET CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING

-41-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

QUARTER FOR THE CALCULATION OF VAR AMOUNTS AT

YEAR-END AND OVER EACH OF THE FOUR QUARTERS FOR THE CALCULATION

OF AVERAGE VAR AMOUNTS DURING THE YEAR. THE MODEL INCLUDES ALL

OF THE COMPANYS DEBT AS WELL AS ALL INTEREST RATE AND

FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND QUALIFYING EQUITY

INVESTMENTS. THE VALUES OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTIONS DO NOT

CHANGE ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS WITH THE UNDERLYING CURRENCIES, AS

EXCHANGE RATES VARY. THEREFORE, THE HEDGE COVERAGE ASSUMED TO BE

OBTAINED FROM EACH OPTION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ITS

RESPECTIVE SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY VALUES. FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS AND RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH CERTAIN OF

THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE

MODEL.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES

NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WILL

BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL

EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS. SEE NOTE 13 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REGARDING THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002

AND 2001.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

COMPANY INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES AFTER ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND

TRANSACTIONS. IN DECEMBER 1999, DVD FINANCING, INC. (DFI),

A SUBSIDIARY OF DISNEY VACATION DEVELOPMENT, INC. AND AN

INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, COMPLETED A RECEIVABLE SALE

TRANSACTION. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SALE, DFI PREPARES SEPARATE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH ITS SEPARATE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE ALSO CONSOLIDATED IN THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

IN JULY 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS NO. 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

(SFAS 141),

WHICH REQUIRES ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER

JUNE 30, 2001 BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD.

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2001, THE COMPANY

ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(SFAS 142). SFAS 142 ADDRESSES THE FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR ACQUIRED GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES. AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING

SFAS 142, GOODWILL AND A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE

COMPANYS INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE NO LONGER AMORTIZED.

PURSUANT TO SFAS 142, INTANGIBLE ASSETS MUST BE

PERIODICALLY TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT, AND THE NEW STANDARD

PROVIDES SIX MONTHS TO COMPLETE THE IMPAIRMENT REVIEW. DURING

FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS IMPAIRMENT REVIEW, WHICH

INDICATED THAT THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT (SEE NOTE 6).

THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED

WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

(SFAS 143) IN

AUGUST 2001. SFAS 143 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR

THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF AN ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATION AND ITS ASSOCIATED ASSET RETIREMENT COST. THE COMPANY

EXPECTS THAT THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 143 WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL POSITION UPON ADOPTION. THE COMPANY PLANS TO ADOPT

SFAS 143 EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2002.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE

IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

(SFAS 144),

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2001, WHICH DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL POSITION. SFAS 144 ESTABLISHES A SINGLE

ACCOUNTING MODEL FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED

ASSETS, INCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

IN JUNE 2002, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 146,

ACCOUNTING FOR

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

(SFAS 146). SFAS 146 REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR

A COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITY BE

RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED. SFAS 146

REQUIRES THAT THE INITIAL MEASUREMENT OF A LIABILITY BE AT FAIR

VALUE. THE COMPANY PLANS TO ADOPT SFAS 146 EFFECTIVE

OCTOBER 1, 2002 AND DOES NOT EXPECT THAT THE ADOPTION WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2000, THE COMPANY

ADOPTED TWO NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, AICPA STATEMENT OF

POSITION NO. 00-2,

ACCOUNTING BY PRODUCERS OR

DISTRIBUTORS OF FILMS

(SOP 00-2) AND STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

(SFAS 133), SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 138 (SFAS 138).

SOP 00-2 ESTABLISHES NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR

PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS OF FILMS, WHICH RESULTED IN CHANGES

IN REVENUE RECOGNITION AND ACCOUNTING FOR EXPLOITATION COSTS,

INCLUDING ADVERTISING AND MARKETING EXPENSES AND DEVELOPMENT AND

OVERHEAD COSTS. AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF SOP 00-2,

THE COMPANY RECORDED A ONE-TIME AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF

$228 MILLION, OR $0.11 PER SHARE, REPRESENTING THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION. THE CHARGE REPRESENTS COSTS

THAT WERE CAPITALIZED AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, THAT WOULD

HAVE BEEN EXPENSED UNDER THE NEW RULES. THE ADOPTION OF

SOP 00-2 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OPERATING

RESULTS.

SFAS 133 AND SFAS 138 REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY

RECORD ALL DERIVATIVES ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE.

CHANGES IN DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUES THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR

VALUE HEDGES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS OFFSETS TO THE

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF RELATED HEDGED ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND

FIRM COMMITMENTS. CHANGES IN THE DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUES THAT ARE

DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE DEFERRED AND RECORDED AS A

COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(AOCI) UNTIL THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS OCCUR AND ARE

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF A HEDGING

DERIVATIVES CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE IS IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED

IN EARNINGS. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE EXECUTED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT

PURPOSES BUT NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER SFAS 133 AND

SFAS 138 ARE RECORDED AT THEIR MARKET VALUE AND RECOGNIZED

IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS 133 AS OF

OCTOBER 1, 2000, AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRANSITION

PROVISIONS, THE COMPANY RECORDED A ONE-TIME AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF

$50 MILLION, OR $0.02 PER SHARE, IN ITS CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME REPRESENTING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE

ADOPTION, AND AN AFTER-TAX UNREALIZED GAIN OF $60 MILLION

TO AOCI. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON OPERATING RESULTS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

FOOTNOTES THERETO. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE

ESTIMATES.

OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANYS REPORTING UNITS FOR

PURPOSES OF APPLYING THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 142 ARE: CABLE

NETWORKS, TELEVISION BROADCASTING, RADIO, STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT,

CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND PARKS AND RESORTS. SFAS 142 REQUIRES

THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO

ITS CARRYING AMOUNT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS

LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO

THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE

ASSETS WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THEIR CARRYING

VALUE. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY

EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS

EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES AND INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES,

INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS;

FORWARD, OPTION AND SWAPTION CONTRACTS, AND INTEREST

RATE CAPS.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS

BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS

RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR UNDERTAKING

VARIOUS HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DERIVATIVES

INTO WHICH THE COMPANY ENTERS: HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AND

HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE. HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE ARE

ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED

ASSET, LIABILITY, OR A FIRM COMMITMENT. HEDGES OF CASH FLOW

EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE A FORECASTED

TRANSACTION (I.E. FORECASTED REVENUE) OR THE VARIABILITY OF CASH

FLOWS TO BE PAID RELATED TO A RECOGNIZED LIABILITY (I.E.

FLOATING RATE DEBT).

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES AND ASSIGNS THE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFIC

ASSETS, OR SPECIFIC LIABILITIES. WHEN HEDGED ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES ARE SOLD OR EXTINGUISHED OR THE FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO OCCUR, THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED HEDGING

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OPTION PREMIUMS AND UNREALIZED LOSSES ON FORWARD

CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE

RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS OTHER ASSETS. UNREALIZED GAINS

ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST

RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID UNDER THE AGREEMENTS

ARE INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES.

REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE

INCOME STATEMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE

ITEMS BEING HEDGED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES THE DIFFERENTIAL FOR

INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED

UNDER THE AGREEMENTS AS INTEREST AND EXCHANGE RATES SHIFT AS

ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIVES OF THE SWAPS.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE TERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE SWAP

AGREEMENTS, PRIOR TO THEIR ORIGINAL MATURITY, ARE DEFERRED AND

AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE

UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS.

CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY AS

THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (SEE NOTES 7 AND 13).

EARNINGS PER SHARE

THE COMPANY PRESENTS BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AMOUNTS. BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY

DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON

SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EPS AMOUNTS ARE

BASED UPON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON

EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. COMMON EQUIVALENT

SHARES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION IN PERIODS IN WHICH

THEY HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BASIC

AND DILUTED EPS, FOR THE COMPANY, IS SOLELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

STOCK OPTIONS. THE COMPANY USES THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD TO

CALCULATE THE IMPACT OF OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS. STOCK OPTIONS

FOR WHICH THE EXERCISE PRICE EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE

OVER THE PERIOD HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT ON EPS AND,

ACCORDINGLY, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, 2001

AND 2000, OPTIONS FOR 156 MILLION, 81 MILLION AND

DILUTED EPS CALCULATION FOR DISNEY COMMON STOCK BECAUSE THEY

WERE ANTI-DILUTIVE.

STOCK OPTIONS

THE COMPANY USES THE INTRINSIC-VALUE METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES AND,

ACCORDINGLY, DOES NOT CURRENTLY RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION EXPENSE

FOR ITS STOCK-BASED AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME. SEE NOTE 11 FOR PRO FORMA INFORMATION

SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS

ON OCTOBER 24, 2001, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED

FOX FAMILY WORLDWIDE, INC. (FFW) FOR $5.2 BILLION, FUNDED

WITH $2.9 BILLION OF NEW LONG-TERM BORROWINGS PLUS THE

ASSUMPTION OF $2.3 BILLION OF FFW LONG-TERM DEBT. UPON THE

CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY CHANGED FFWS NAME

TO ABC FAMILY WORLDWIDE, INC. (ABC FAMILY). AMONG THE BUSINESSES

ACQUIRED WERE THE FOX FAMILY CHANNEL, WHICH HAS BEEN RENAMED ABC

FAMILY CHANNEL, A PROGRAMMING SERVICE THAT CURRENTLY REACHES

APPROXIMATELY 85 MILLION CABLE AND SATELLITE TELEVISION

SUBSCRIBERS THROUGHOUT THE U.S.; A 76% INTEREST IN FOX KIDS

EUROPE, WHICH REACHES MORE THAN 31 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS

ACROSS EUROPE; FOX KIDS CHANNELS IN LATIN AMERICA, AND THE SABAN

LIBRARY AND ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION BUSINESSES.

OUR MOTIVATION FOR THE ACQUISITION WAS TO ACQUIRE

A FULLY INTEGRATED CABLE CHANNEL AS WELL AS A SIGNIFICANT

INTERNATIONAL CABLE PRESENCE AND THEREFORE INCREASE SHAREHOLDER

VALUE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN REACH THIS OBJECTIVE THROUGH THE

USE OF NEW STRATEGIES THAT INCLUDE CROSS PROMOTION WITH OUR

OTHER TELEVISION PROPERTIES, REPURPOSING A PORTION OF THE

PROGRAMMING OF THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, UTILIZING PROGRAMMING

FROM THE DISNEY AND ABC LIBRARIES, DEVELOPING ORIGINAL

PROGRAMMING AND BY REDUCING OPERATING COSTS.

THE ACQUISITION OF ABC FAMILY HAS BEEN ACCOUNTED

FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS 141. THE COST OF THE

ACQUISITION WAS ALLOCATED TO THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES

ASSUMED BASED ON ESTIMATES OF THEIR RESPECTIVE FAIR VALUES AT

THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. FAIR VALUES WERE DETERMINED BY INTERNAL

STUDIES AND INDEPENDENT THIRD PARTY APPRAISALS.

TAX PURPOSES.

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS HAVE INCORPORATED ABC FAMILYS ACTIVITY ON A

CONSOLIDATED BASIS FROM OCTOBER 24, 2001, THE DATE OF

ACQUISITION. ON AN UNAUDITED PRO FORMA BASIS, ADJUSTING ONLY FOR

THE ASSUMPTION THAT THE ACQUISITION OF ABC FAMILY AND RELATED

INCREMENTAL BORROWINGS HAD OCCURRED AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL

2001, REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 AND

2001 WERE $25,360 MILLION AND $25,803 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. AS-REPORTED AND UNAUDITED PRO FORMA NET

INCOME (LOSS) AND EARNINGS (LOSS) PER SHARE FOR FISCAL

2002 WERE APPROXIMATELY THE SAME. THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA

EARNINGS PER SHARE IMPACT ON FISCAL 2001 WAS APPROXIMATELY $0.01

DILUTIVE, ASSUMING THAT THE INCREMENTAL ACQUISITION GOODWILL HAD

NOT BEEN AMORTIZED IN THE PRIOR YEAR PURSUANT TO THE NEW

GOODWILL ACCOUNTING RULES. THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA INFORMATION

IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAD

THE ACQUISITION ACTUALLY OCCURRED AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL

2001, NOR IS IT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

IN FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANY SOLD THE DISNEY STORE

OPERATIONS IN JAPAN GENERATING A PRE-TAX GAIN OF

$34 MILLION. IN FISCAL 2001, THE COMPANY SOLD INFOSEEK

JAPAN K.K. GENERATING A $22 MILLION PRE-TAX GAIN AND IN

FISCAL 2000 IT SOLD FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS, ULTRASEEK

CORPORATION AND EUROSPORT GENERATING PRE-TAX GAINS OF

$243 MILLION, $153 MILLION AND $93 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THESE GAINS ARE REPORTED IN THE LINE GAIN ON

SALE OF BUSINESSES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

INCOME.

ON MARCH 20, 2001, THE COMPANY CONVERTED ALL

OF ITS OUTSTANDING INTERNET GROUP COMMON STOCK INTO DISNEY

COMMON STOCK, RESULTING IN THE ISSUANCE OF APPROXIMATELY

8.6 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK. FOR THE YEAR

ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, EARNINGS ATTRIBUTED TO DISNEY

COMMON STOCK REFLECT APPROXIMATELY 72% OF INTERNET GROUP LOSSES

FROM OCTOBER 1, 2000 THROUGH JANUARY 28, 2001 (THE

LAST DATE PRIOR TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CONVERSION), AND 100%

THEREAFTER. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS CEASED THE OPERATIONS

OF THE GO.COM PORTAL BUSINESS, WHICH RESULTED IN RESTRUCTURING

AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $878 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001 (SEE

NOTE 15).

EURO DISNEY AND OTHER EQUITY

INVESTMENTS

EURO DISNEY OPERATES THE DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS

ON A 4,800-ACRE SITE NEAR PARIS, FRANCE. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS

FOR ITS 39% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN EURO DISNEY USING THE EQUITY

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, THE

COMPANYS RECORDED INVESTMENT IN EURO DISNEY, INCLUDING

ACCOUNTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE, WAS $424 MILLION.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF

EURO DISNEY IN 1994, EURO DISNEY ASSOCIÉS S.N.C. (DISNEY

SNC), A WHOLLY-OWNED AFFILIATE OF THE COMPANY, ENTERED INTO A

LEASE ARRANGEMENT WITH A NONCANCELABLE TERM OF 12 YEARS

RELATED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DISNEYLAND PARK ASSETS, AND

THEN ENTERED INTO A 12-YEAR SUBLEASE AGREEMENT WITH EURO DISNEY.

REMAINING LEASE RENTALS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 OF

APPROXIMATELY $702 MILLION RECEIVABLE FROM EURO DISNEY

UNDER THE SUBLEASE APPROXIMATE THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY DISNEY SNC

UNDER THE LEASE. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SUBLEASE TERM, EURO

DISNEY WILL HAVE THE OPTION TO ASSUME DISNEY SNCS RIGHTS

AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LEASE. IF EURO DISNEY DOES NOT

EXERCISE ITS OPTION, DISNEY SNC MAY PURCHASE THE ASSETS,

CONTINUE TO LEASE THE ASSETS OR ELECT TO TERMINATE THE LEASE, IN

WHICH CASE DISNEY SNC WOULD MAKE A TERMINATION PAYMENT TO THE

LESSOR EQUAL TO 75% OF THE LESSORS THEN OUTSTANDING DEBT

RELATED TO THE DISNEYLAND PARK ASSETS, WHICH IS ESTIMATED TO BE

$1.1 BILLION; DISNEY SNC COULD THEN SELL OR LEASE THE

ASSETS ON BEHALF OF THE LESSOR TO SATISFY THE REMAINING DEBT,

WITH ANY EXCESS PROCEEDS PAYABLE TO DISNEY SNC.

ALSO, AS PART OF THE RESTRUCTURING, THE COMPANY

AGREED TO PROVIDE A 10-YEAR UNSECURED STANDBY CREDIT FACILITY OF

APPROXIMATELY $164 MILLION, BEARING INTEREST AT THE PARIS

INTERBANK OFFERED RATE (PIBOR). AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2002,

EURO DISNEY HAD DRAWN $61 MILLION UNDER THIS FACILITY. IT

IS EXPECTED THAT EURO DISNEY WILL DRAW ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS UNDER

THE LINE OF CREDIT DURING FISCAL 2003. THE COMPANY ALSO AGREED,

AS LONG AS ANY OF THE RESTRUCTURED DEBT IS OUTSTANDING, TO

MAINTAIN OWNERSHIP OF AT LEAST 25% OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMON

STOCK OF EURO DISNEY THROUGH JUNE 2004 AND AT LEAST 16.67% FOR

AN ADDITIONAL TERM THEREAFTER.

AFTER A FIVE-YEAR WAIVER RESULTING FROM THE

RESTRUCTURING, ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES FROM EURO DISNEY

WERE PARTIALLY REINSTATED BEGINNING FISCAL YEAR 1999. AS A

RESULT, THE COMPANY EARNED APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION,

$28 MILLION AND $30 MILLION IN ROYALTIES AND

MANAGEMENT FEES IN FISCAL YEARS 2002, 2001 AND 2000,

RESPECTIVELY. ROYALTIES ARE TO BE FULLY REINSTATED BEGINNING IN

FISCAL YEAR 2004, WITH MANAGEMENT FEES PROGRESSIVELY REINSTATED

THROUGH FISCAL YEAR 2018.

IN NOVEMBER 1999, EURO DISNEY STOCKHOLDERS

APPROVED AN INCREASE IN SHARE CAPITAL THROUGH AN EQUITY RIGHTS

OFFERING. THE OFFERING RAISED $238 MILLION. THE NET

PROCEEDS WERE USED TO PARTIALLY FINANCE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A

SECOND THEME PARK, WALT DISNEY STUDIOS WHICH OPENED ON

MARCH 16,

-70-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2002. THE COMPANY SUBSCRIBED TO APPROXIMATELY

$91 MILLION OF THE EQUITY RIGHTS OFFERING, MAINTAINING ITS

39% INTEREST IN EURO DISNEY.

SINCE THE OPENING OF THE WALT DISNEY STUDIOS,

EURO DISNEYS ATTENDANCE AND OCCUPANCY AT ITS PARKS AND

RESORTS HAVE INCREASED, ALTHOUGH ATTENDANCE GROWTH HAS BEEN

BELOW ORIGINAL EXPECTATIONS. BECAUSE OF EURO DISNEYS

LIMITED CASH RESOURCES AND ITS SIGNIFICANT DEBT BURDEN,

INCLUDING THE OBLIGATION TO REPAY THE LINE OF CREDIT WITH THE

COMPANY IN JUNE 2004, EURO DISNEY WILL NEED TO EXPERIENCE

CONTINUED STEADY GROWTH IN OPERATING INCOME IN ORDER TO MEET ITS

CASH NEEDS. IF THIS GROWTH IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO PROVIDE THE

NEEDED FUNDING, ADDITIONAL FINANCING MAY BE REQUIRED. THERE CAN

BE NO ASSURANCE THAT EURO DISNEY WOULD BE ABLE TO SECURE SUCH

ADDITIONAL FINANCING, AND IF SUCH FINANCING CAN BE ARRANGED, THE

TERMS THEREOF MAY BE LESS FAVORABLE THAN CURRENT FINANCING

ARRANGEMENTS.

INVESTMENTS, AT COST

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 AND 2001, THE

COMPANY HELD $14 MILLION AND $92 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. AS

OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, THE

COMPANY ALSO HELD $148 MILLION AND $472 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF NON-PUBLIC COST METHOD INVESTMENTS. REALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES ARE DETERMINED PRINCIPALLY ON AN AVERAGE COST

BASIS. IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED

$239 MILLION, $87 MILLION AND $41 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, IN NET GAINS ON SALES OF SECURITIES. INCLUDED IN

FISCAL 2002 IS A $216 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE

REMAINING SHARES OF KNIGHT RIDDER STOCK THAT THE COMPANY HAD

RECEIVED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN

PUBLISHING OPERATIONS THAT HAD BEEN ACQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH

THE ACQUISITION OF ABC.

IN ADDITION, IN 2002 AND 2001, THE COMPANY

RECORDED NON-CASH CHARGES OF $2 MILLION AND

$241 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO REFLECT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

LOSSES IN VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS. IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000,

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES

WERE NOT MATERIAL.

INVESTMENT IN LEVERAGED LEASES

THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO INCLUDES

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASING INVESTMENTS MADE BETWEEN

1992 AND 1994 TOTALING $289 MILLION, WHICH ARE DIVERSIFIED

ACROSS THREE AIR CARRIERS (UNITED AIRLINES 

$114 MILLION, DELTA AIRLINES  $119 MILLION,

AND FEDEX  $56 MILLION) AND ELEVEN AIRCRAFT.

RISK OF LOSS UNDER THESE TRANSACTIONS IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO

THE ABILITY OF THE AIR CARRIERS TO MAKE UNDERLYING LEASE

PAYMENTS.

WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR OUR INVESTMENT IN

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT LEASE TRANSACTIONS GIVEN THE CURRENT STATUS

OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. WE HAVE, IN PARTICULAR, BEEN MONITORING

UNITED AIRLINES WHICH HAS INDICATED THAT IF IT DOES NOT OBTAIN

SIGNIFICANT CONCESSIONS FROM EACH OF ITS EMPLOYEE UNIONS,

ACHIEVE COST SAVINGS IN OTHER OPERATING AREAS OF THE COMPANY AND

OBTAIN A LOAN GUARANTEE FROM THE AIRLINE TRANSPORTATION

STABILIZATION BOARD, IT WILL HAVE TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY

PROTECTION. TO DATE, ALL PAYMENTS ON THESE LEASES HAVE BEEN MADE

WHEN DUE. THE INABILITY OF ANY OF THE COMPANIES TO MAKE THEIR

LEASE PAYMENTS OR THE TERMINATION OF OUR LEASES THROUGH A

BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDING COULD RESULT IN MATERIAL CHARGES RELATED

TO A WRITE-DOWN OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR INVESTMENT AND COULD

ACCELERATE INCOME TAX PAYMENTS.

THE COMPANYS LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT

INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF CERTAIN INCOME TAX BENEFITS THAT ARE

PROJECTED TO BE REALIZED IN THE FUTURE UNDER THE CURRENT

U.S. INCOME TAX LAWS. AS DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN

NOTE 8, THE U.S. CONGRESS IS CONSIDERING A CHANGE IN THE

APPLICABLE INCOME TAX LAW.

COMMERCIAL PAPER

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY MAINTAINS U.S. AND EUROPEAN

COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS WITH A COMBINED PROGRAM SIZE OF

HAD ESTABLISHED BANK FACILITIES TOTALING $4.5 BILLION TO

SUPPORT COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS, WITH HALF OF THE FACILITIES

SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN FEBRUARY 2003 AND THE OTHER HALF IN MARCH

2005. THE COMPANY PLANS TO RENEW OR EXTEND THESE BANK FACILITIES

PRIOR TO THEIR SCHEDULED EXPIRATION. UNDER THE BANK FACILITIES,

THE COMPANY HAS THE OPTION TO BORROW AT LIBOR-BASED RATES PLUS A

SPREAD DEPENDING ON THE COMPANYS SENIOR UNSECURED DEBT

RATING. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD NOT

BORROWED AGAINST THE BANK FACILITIES. AT SEPTEMBER 30,

2002, THE TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING FROM COMMERCIAL PAPER WAS

$721 MILLION, WITH MATURITIES RANGING FROM 4 TO

158 DAYS AND STATED INTEREST RATES RANGING FROM 1.85%

$7.5 BILLION SHELF REGISTRATION

STATEMENT

IN AUGUST 2001, THE COMPANY FILED A U.S. SHELF

COMMISSION (SEC) WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO ISSUE FROM

TIME TO TIME, UP TO $7.5 BILLION OF SECURITIES, INCLUDING

DEBT SECURITIES, PREFERRED STOCK, COMMON STOCK, DEPOSITARY

SHARES, WARRANTS AND PURCHASE CONTRACTS. OF THE

$7.5 BILLION AVAILABLE AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002,

$2.75 BILLION OF DEBT HAD BEEN ISSUED UNDER THE

COMPANYS U.S. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM (DESCRIBED

BELOW) AND $1.303 BILLION OF DEBT HAD BEEN ISSUED UNDER

OTHER U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT (ALSO DESCRIBED BELOW).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

U.S. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM

IN SEPTEMBER 2001, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A

$6.5 BILLION U.S. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM UNDER THE

U.S. SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT DESCRIBED ABOVE FOR THE

ISSUANCE OF VARIOUS TYPES OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS FIXED OR

FLOATING RATE NOTES, U.S. DOLLAR OR FOREIGN CURRENCY

DENOMINATED NOTES, REDEEMABLE NOTES, GLOBAL NOTES AND DUAL

CURRENCY OR OTHER INDEXED NOTES. IN 2002, THE COMPANY ISSUED

$2.75 BILLION UNDER THE CURRENT PROGRAM. THE REMAINING

CAPACITY UNDER THE PROGRAM MAY BE FURTHER REDUCED FROM TIME TO

TIME TO THE EXTENT THAT THE COMPANY ISSUES SECURITIES OUTSIDE OF

THE EXISTING U.S. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM BUT UNDER THE

CURRENT SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT. AT SEPTEMBER 30,

2002, THE TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE CURRENT AND PRIOR

U.S. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAMS WAS $8.042 BILLION. THE

MATURITIES OF CURRENT OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS RANGED FROM

1 TO 91 YEARS AND STATED INTEREST RATES RANGED FROM

1.46% TO 7.55%.

OTHER U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED DEBT

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY MAY ISSUE BONDS OR

NOTES SEPARATELY FROM THE U.S. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM, UNDER

SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENTS IN EFFECT AT THE TIME. AT

SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, THE TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING FROM THESE

OFFERINGS, WHICH INCLUDED GLOBAL BONDS AND QUARTERLY INTEREST

BONDS (QUIBS), WAS $1.303 BILLION. THE MATURITIES OF THESE

OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS RANGED FROM 1 TO 29 YEARS AND THE

STATED INTEREST RATES RANGED FROM 3.9% TO 7%.

PRIVATELY PLACED DEBT

IN 1996, THE COMPANY RAISED $850 MILLION OF

PRIVATELY PLACED FINANCING. THE NOTES PAY 7.02% INTEREST PER

ANNUM AND AMORTIZE SEMI-ANNUALLY. THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL AS

OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 WAS $425 MILLION.

EUROPEAN MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM

IN JULY 2002, THE COMPANY RENEWED ITS EUROPEAN

MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM FOR THE ISSUANCE OF VARIOUS TYPES OF

DEBT INSTRUMENTS SUCH AS FIXED OR FLOATING RATE NOTES,

U.S. DOLLAR OR FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED NOTES,

REDEEMABLE NOTES, INDEX LINKED AND DUAL CURRENCY NOTES. AT SUCH

TIME, THE PROGRAM SIZE WAS INCREASED FROM $3.0 BILLION TO

$4.0 BILLION. IN 2002, THE COMPANY ISSUED $989 MILLION

UNDER THE PROGRAM. THE REMAINING CAPACITY TO ISSUE UNDER THE

PROGRAM IS $2.354 BILLION, SUBJECT TO MARKET CONDITIONS AND

OTHER FACTORS IMPACTING OUR BORROWING CAPACITY. THE REMAINING

CAPACITY UNDER THE PROGRAM REPLENISHES AS OUTSTANDING DEBT UNDER

THE PROGRAM MATURES. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, THE TOTAL DEBT

OUTSTANDING FROM THE PROGRAM WAS $1.646 BILLION. THE

MATURITIES OF CURRENT OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS RANGED FROM 1 TO

5 YEARS AND STATED INTEREST RATES RANGED FROM 2.63% TO 14%.

THE COMPANY HAS OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS IN THE PROGRAM

DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS, HONG KONG DOLLARS, SINGAPORE

DOLLARS, JAPANESE YEN AND SOUTH AFRICAN RAND.

PREFERRED STOCK

AS A RESULT OF THE FOX FAMILY WORLDWIDE, INC.

(NOW ABC FAMILY WORLDWIDE, INC.) ACQUISITION IN OCTOBER 2001

(THE ABC FAMILY ACQUISITION), THE COMPANY ASSUMED SERIES A

PREFERRED STOCK WITH A 9% COUPON AND QUARTERLY DIVIDEND PAYMENTS

VALUED AT APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION WITH AN EFFECTIVE COST

OF CAPITAL OF 5.25%. THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK IS

CALLABLE STARTING AUGUST 1, 2007, AND HAS A MATURITY OF

AUGUST 1, 2027.

IN JULY 1999, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY ISSUED

$102 MILLION OF AUCTION MARKET PREFERRED STOCK (AMPS).

THESE ARE PERPETUAL, NON-CUMULATIVE, NON-REDEEMABLE INSTRUMENTS.

QUARTERLY DISTRIBUTIONS, IF DECLARED, ARE AT THE RATE OF 5.427%

PER ANNUM, FOR THE FIRST FIVE YEARS. AMPS WILL BE REMARKETED

THROUGH AN AUCTION PROCEDURE IN JULY 2004. THE COMPANY IS

REQUIRED TO SUBMIT A VALID BID FOR ALL THE AMPS AT THAT TIME.

BASED ON THE COMPANYS CURRENT CREDIT RATING, THE HOLDERS

MAY REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO REMARKET THE AMPS AT AN EARLIER DATE.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT RECEIVED NOTIFICATION FROM THE AMPS HOLDERS

TO CONDUCT AN EARLIER AUCTION.

THE SERIES A PREFERRED STOCK AND THE AMPS

ARE CLASSIFIED AS BORROWINGS GIVEN THEIR SUBSTANTIVE SIMILARITY

CAPITAL CITIES/ ABC AND ABC FAMILY PUBLICLY

TRADED DEBT

AS A RESULT OF THE ABC FAMILY ACQUISITION IN

OCTOBER 2001, THE COMPANY ASSUMED $475 MILLION OF

9 1/4% SENIOR NOTES DUE 2007, VALUED AT $502 MILLION

AND $560 MILLION OF 10 1/4% SENIOR DISCOUNT NOTES DUE

2007, VALUED AT $589 MILLION (COLLECTIVELY, THE ABC

FAMILY NOTES). AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE ABC FAMILY NOTES WAS $892 MILLION, AS THE COMPANY

REPURCHASED $194 MILLION OF THE NOTES PRIOR TO THE STATED

MATURITY DATE. THE ABC FAMILY NOTES WERE REDEEMABLE BY ABC

FAMILY STARTING NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AND SEMI-ANNUALLY

THEREAFTER. ABC FAMILY EXERCISED ITS RIGHT TO REDEEM THE NOTES

AND, ACCORDINGLY, ALL OF THE OUTSTANDING ABC FAMILY NOTES WERE

REDEEMED ON NOVEMBER 1, 2002 AT A PRICE OF 104.625% FOR THE

SENIOR NOTES AND 105.125% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT FOR THE SENIOR

DISCOUNT NOTES. THE REDEMPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, THE ABC FAMILY NOTES

WERE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT.

AS A RESULT OF THE CAPITAL CITIES/ ABC, INC.

ACQUISITION IN 1996, THE COMPANY ASSUMED VARIOUS DEBT PREVIOUSLY

ISSUED BY CAPITAL CITIES/ ABC, INC. CERTAIN OF THESE SECURITIES

WERE SUBSEQUENTLY EXCHANGED FOR DIFFERENT SECURITIES. AT

SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, THE OUTSTANDING BALANCE WAS

$193 MILLION WITH MATURITIES RANGING FROM 7 TO

19 YEARS AND STATED INTEREST RATES RANGING FROM 8.75% TO

9.645%.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

STATE TAX RETURNS OF INFOSEEK AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE INFOSEEK ACQUISITION ON

NOVEMBER 18, 1999 (SEE NOTE 3), WHERE APPLICABLE STATE

TAX LAWS LIMIT THE UTILIZATION OF SUCH NOLS. IN ADDITION,

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 WERE REDUCED BY A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE TAX BENEFITS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN NOLS REFLECTED ON TAX RETURNS OF ABC

FAMILY WORLDWIDE, INC. AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO

THE ABC FAMILY ACQUISITION ON OCTOBER 24, 2001 (SEE

NOTE 3). SINCE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO ACQUIRED

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, THE SUBSEQUENT REALIZATION OF THESE TAX

BENEFITS WOULD RESULT IN THE APPLICATION OF THE ALLOWANCE AMOUNT

AS A REDUCTION TO GOODWILL.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, APPROXIMATELY

$354 MILLION OF NOL CARRYFORWARDS WERE AVAILABLE TO OFFSET

FUTURE TAXABLE INCOME THROUGH THE YEAR 2021. SINCE THE

ACQUISITION OF ABC FAMILY CONSTITUTED AN OWNERSHIP CHANGE AS

DEFINED UNDER SECTION 382 OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE, THE

UTILIZATION OF ABC FAMILYS PRE-CHANGE NOLS WILL BE SUBJECT

TO AN ANNUAL LIMITATION. HOWEVER, SUCH ANNUAL LIMITATION WILL

NOT IMPAIR THE REALIZATION OF THESE NOLS.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, APPROXIMATELY

$75 MILLION OF FOREIGN TAX CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS WERE

AVAILABLE AS CREDITS AGAINST FUTURE INCOME TAXES. FOREIGN TAX

CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS WILL EXPIRE THROUGH THE YEAR 2005.

IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, INCOME TAX BENEFITS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION TRANSACTIONS OF

$8 MILLION, $48 MILLION AND $197 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, WERE ALLOCATED TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

DURING 2002 THE COMPANY DERIVED TAX BENEFITS OF

$69 MILLION FROM AN EXCLUSION PROVIDED UNDER

U.S. INCOME TAX LAWS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN

EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME (ETI) ATTRIBUTABLE TO

FOREIGN TRADING GROSS RECEIPTS. THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION

(WTO) HAS RULED THAT THIS ETI EXCLUSION REPRESENTS A

PROHIBITED EXPORT SUBSIDY UNDER THE WTO AGREEMENT ON SUBSIDIES

AND COUNTERVAILING MEASURES. BASED UPON THIS RULING, A WTO

ARBITRATION PANEL HAS DETERMINED THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION

(EU) MAY IMPOSE UP TO $4 BILLION PER YEAR IN

TRADE SANCTIONS AGAINST THE U.S., ALTHOUGH THE EU HAS YET TO

IMPOSE SUCH SANCTIONS. PRESIDENT BUSH HAS STATED THAT THE U.S.

WILL CHANGE ITS TAX LAWS IN ORDER TO COMPLY WITH THE WTO RULING.

VARIOUS LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS PROVIDING FOR THE REPEAL OF THE

ETI EXCLUSION HAVE ALSO INTRODUCED BROAD-BASED INTERNATIONAL TAX

REFORMS, BUT THE PRESIDENTIAL ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS HAVE

NOT YET AGREED UPON A SOLUTION TO THIS ISSUE. SINCE THE IMPACT

OF THIS MATTER UPON THE COMPANY DEPENDS UPON THE ACTIONS OF THE

EU AND THE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS OF ANY TAX LEGISLATION ULTIMATELY

ENACTED BY CONGRESS, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT THE IMPACT ON

FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS. HOWEVER, IF THE ETI EXCLUSION IS

REPEALED AND LEGISLATION THAT WOULD REPLACE THE ETI EXCLUSION

BENEFIT IS NOT ENACTED, THE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS TAX

PROVISION COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY

AUDITED BY BOTH FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM

TIME TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. AMONG

CURRENT AUDITS, THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) IS IN THE

FINAL STAGES OF ITS EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANYS FEDERAL

INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 1993 THROUGH 1995. IN CONNECTION WITH

THIS EXAMINATION, THE IRS HAS PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS THAT

CHALLENGE CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS TAX POSITIONS WHICH, IF

UPHELD THROUGH THE ADMINISTRATIVE AND LEGAL PROCESS, COULD HAVE

A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS TAX POSITIONS COMPLY WITH

THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, ACCUMULATED

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS FOR THE

PENSION PLANS WITH ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS IN EXCESS OF

PLAN ASSETS WERE $495 MILLION, $471 MILLION AND

$151 MILLION, $119 MILLION AND $0, RESPECTIVELY, FOR

2001.

THE COMPANYS ACCUMULATED PENSION BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 AND 2001 WERE

$2.2 BILLION AND $1.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH

98.2% AND 97.7%, RESPECTIVELY, WERE VESTED. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY CONTRIBUTES TO VARIOUS PENSION PLANS UNDER UNION AND

INDUSTRY-WIDE AGREEMENTS. IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, THE COSTS

RECOGNIZED UNDER THESE PLANS WERE $41 MILLION,

$40 MILLION AND $38 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE MARKET VALUES OF THE COMPANYS SHARES

HELD BY THE PENSION PLAN MASTER TRUST AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2002 AND 2001 WERE $42 MILLION AND $52 MILLION,

EXCESS OF PLAN ASSETS WERE $680 MILLION AND

$199 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY FOR 2002, AND $441 MILLION

AND $79 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY FOR 2001.

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR THE

POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT

DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES WOULD

REDUCE TOTAL SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS AND POST-RETIREMENT

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS BY $14 MILLION AND $118 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED

HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES WOULD INCREASE TOTAL SERVICE AND

INTEREST COSTS AND POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS BY

$19 MILLION AND $153 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE ANNUAL

INCREASE IN COST OF POST-RETIREMENT BENEFITS IS ASSUMED TO

DECREASE 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT PER YEAR FOR 5 YEARS

UNTIL REACHING 5.0%.

THE COMPANY HAS SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLANS THAT

ALLOW ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO ALLOCATE UP TO 10% OR 15% OF SALARY

THROUGH PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS DEPENDING ON THE PLAN IN WHICH THE

EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATES. THE COMPANY MATCHES 50% OF THE

EMPLOYEES PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS, UP TO PLAN LIMITS. IN

2002, 2001 AND 2000, THE COSTS OF THESE PLANS WERE

$29 MILLION, $32 MILLION AND $30 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

DURING 2002 AND 2001, THE COMPANY HEDGED CERTAIN

INVESTMENT HOLDINGS USING FORWARD SALE CONTRACTS. THE CONTRACTS,

WITH NOTIONAL AMOUNTS TOTALING $530 MILLION IN 2002 AND

2001, WERE TERMINATED IN OCTOBER 2001.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST

RATE CHANGES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO MANAGE THE

IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND

ON THE MARKET VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A MINIMUM AMOUNT

OF FIXED RATE DEBT EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT.

SIGNIFICANT INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE COMPANY DURING 2002 AND 2001 INCLUDED

PAY-FLOATING AND PAY-FIXED SWAPS. PAY-FLOATING SWAPS EFFECTIVELY

CONVERT FIXED RATE MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS TO VARIABLE

RATE INSTRUMENTS INDEXED TO LIBOR. THESE SWAP AGREEMENTS EXPIRE

IN ONE TO 30 YEARS. PAY-FIXED SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT

FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS TO FIXED RATE INSTRUMENTS. THE

PAY-FIXED SWAPS EXPIRE IN ONE TO THREE YEARS. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 AND 2001 RESPECTIVELY, THE COMPANY HELD

$300 MILLION AND $500 MILLION OF PAY-FIXED SWAPS THAT

NO LONGER QUALIFIED AS HEDGES. THE PROSPECTIVE CHANGE IN MARKET

VALUES RELATED TO THESE SWAPS FROM THE TIME THEY WERE

INEFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS.

THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

ACTIVITIES ON INCOME IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000 WAS NOT MATERIAL.

THE AMOUNT OF DEFERRED GAINS FROM INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

TRANSACTIONS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 AND 2001 WAS

$41 MILLION AND $22 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY TRANSACTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND IS

SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND

CASH FLOW FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE

CHANGES THEREBY ENABLING MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON CORE

BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT

CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE

VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, FIRM

COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED FOREIGN

CURRENCY REVENUES. THE COMPANY USES OPTION STRATEGIES AND

FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUES. IN ACCORDANCE

WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY HEDGES A MINIMUM PERCENTAGE (NOT TO

EXCEED A MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE) OF ITS FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS

GENERALLY FOR PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS. THE COMPANY ALSO

USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS,

LIABILITIES AND FIRM COMMITMENTS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE

CONTRACTS OFFSET GAINS OR LOSSES EXPECTED ON THE RELATED

FORECASTED TRANSACTION, ASSET, LIABILITY OR FIRM COMMITMENT. THE

PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EUROPEAN EURO, BRITISH

POUND, JAPANESE YEN AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS

ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED

BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLARS.

-85-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GAINS AND LOSSES ON CONTRACTS HEDGING FORECASTED

FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES ARE RECORDED TO ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI), AND RECLASSIFIED TO CURRENT

EARNINGS WHEN SUCH REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED, OFFSETTING CHANGES

IN THE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES. AT

SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 AND 2001, THE COMPANY HAD DEFERRED GAINS

OF $66 MILLION AND $91 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND

DEFERRED LOSSES OF $85 MILLION AND $24 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE TRANSACTIONS.

DEFERRED AMOUNTS TO BE RECOGNIZED CAN CHANGE WITH

MARKET CONDITIONS AND WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN

THE VALUE OF THE RELATED HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. AMOUNT EXPECTED TO

BE RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS IS A

LOSS OF $30 MILLION. THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED A

$27 MILLION AND $16 MILLION AFTER-TAX GAIN FROM AOCI

TO EARNINGS DURING FISCAL 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH WAS

OFFSET BY NET LOSSES ON ITEMS BEING HEDGED.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 AND 2001, CHANGES IN

VALUE RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES INCLUDED IN AOCI, WERE A LOSS

OF $19 MILLION AND A GAIN OF $69 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED DEFERRED

LOSSES RELATED TO CERTAIN CASH FLOW HEDGES FROM AOCI TO

EARNINGS, DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE TIMING OF THE ORIGINAL

FORECASTED TRANSACTION. DURING FISCAL 2002 AND 2001, THE COMPANY

RECORDED THE CHANGE IN FAIR MARKET VALUE RELATED TO FAIR VALUE

HEDGES AND THE INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES TO

EARNINGS. THESE AMOUNTS WERE NOT MATERIAL. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ON OPERATING INCOME IN 2002

AND IN 2001 WAS A NET GAIN OF $44 MILLION AND

$142 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 AND 2001, THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED CASH, CASH

EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENTS, RECEIVABLES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE,

BORROWINGS AND INTEREST RATE, FORWARD AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 AND 2001, THE FAIR

VALUES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE APPROXIMATED CARRYING VALUES BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM

NATURE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES,

DETERMINED BASED ON BROKER QUOTES OR QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR

RATES FOR THE SAME OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, AND THE RELATED

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS

WITH, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT

ARE COUNTERPARTIES TO ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND DOES NOT

ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY

WOULD NOT REALIZE A MATERIAL LOSS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2002

IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY ONE COUNTERPARTY. THE

COMPANY ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS ONLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION

COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF A- OR BETTER.

THE COMPANYS

-86-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CURRENT POLICY REGARDING AGREEMENTS WITH

FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES IS GENERALLY TO REQUIRE

COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A- OR IN

THE EVENT AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED LIMITS AS DEFINED BY

CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF

INVESTMENT CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, COUNTERPARTIES PLEDGED A TOTAL OF

$14.8 MILLION.

THE COMPANYS RECEIVABLES AND INVESTMENTS DO

NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AT

SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, DUE TO THE WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS

AND MARKETS INTO WHICH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD,

THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS MANY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND THE

DIVERSIFICATION OF THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO AMONG

INSTRUMENTS AND ISSUERS.

COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS,

WHICH ARE PRIMARILY FOR THE PURCHASE OF BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR

VARIOUS FEATURE FILMS, SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING, AGGREGATING

APPROXIMATELY $16.2 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY

$1.1 BILLION FOR AVAILABLE PROGRAMMING AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, AND APPROXIMATELY $11.3 BILLION

RELATED TO SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, PRIMARILY NFL, NBA,

COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND MLB.

IN 1997, THE COMPANY GUARANTEED CERTAIN BOND

ISSUANCES BY THE ANAHEIM PUBLIC AUTHORITY FOR A TOTAL OF

$111 MILLION. THE GUARANTEE ALSO EXTENDS TO INTEREST THAT

WILL TOTAL $319 MILLION OVER THE LIFE OF THE BOND. THE BOND

PROCEEDS WERE USED BY THE CITY OF ANAHEIM TO FINANCE THE

EXPANSION OF THE ANAHEIM CONVENTION CENTER, THE CONSTRUCTION OF

INFRASTRUCTURE WITHIN THE ANAHEIM RESORT AREA AND THE

CONSTRUCTION OF A PUBLIC PARKING FACILITY. REVENUES FROM SALES,

OCCUPANCY AND PROPERTY TAXES FROM THE DISNEYLAND RESORT AND

NON-DISNEY HOTELS ARE USED BY THE CITY OF ANAHEIM TO REPAY THE

BONDS. THE COMPANY HAS GUARANTEED THE BONDS AND IN THE EVENT OF

A DEBT SERVICE SHORTFALL, WILL BE RESPONSIBLE TO FUND SUCH SHORT

FALL. TO THE EXTENT THAT SUBSEQUENT TAX REVENUES EXCEED THE DEBT

SERVICE PAYMENTS IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS, THE COMPANY WOULD BE

REIMBURSED FOR ANY PREVIOUSLY FUNDED SHORT FALLS. WE WILL

CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS SITUATION IN THE FUTURE. TO DATE, THE

TAX REVENUES HAVE EXCEEDED THE DEBT SERVICE PAYMENTS.

THE COMPANY AND THE GOVERNMENT OF THE HONG KONG

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY

COMPANY.

IN THIS LAWSUIT, FILED ON

FEBRUARY 27, 1991 AND PENDING IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY

SUPERIOR COURT, THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT A COMPANY SUBSIDIARY

DEFRAUDED IT AND BREACHED A 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH

RESPECT TO CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH PROPERTIES, BY FAILING TO

ACCOUNT FOR AND PAY ROYALTIES ON REVENUES EARNED FROM THE SALE

OF WINNIE THE POOH MOVIES ON VIDEOCASSETTE AND FROM THE

EXPLOITATION OF WINNIE THE POOH MERCHANDISING RIGHTS. THE

PLAINTIFF SEEKS DAMAGES FOR THE LICENSEES ALLEGED BREACHES

AS WELL AS CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAINTIFFS INTERPRETATION

OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE ACTIVITIES.

THE PLAINTIFF ALSO SEEKS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT ON

THE BASIS OF THE ALLEGED BREACHES. THE COMPANY DISPUTES THAT THE

PLAINTIFF IS ENTITLED TO ANY DAMAGES OR OTHER RELIEF OF ANY

KIND, INCLUDING TERMINATION OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT. THE

CLAIM IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN MARCH 2003. IF EACH OF

THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS WERE TO BE CONFIRMED IN A FINAL

JUDGMENT, DAMAGES AS ARGUED BY THE PLAINTIFF COULD TOTAL AS MUCH

AS SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE

VALUE TO THE COMPANY OF ANY FUTURE EXPLOITATION OF THE LICENSED

RIGHTS. HOWEVER, GIVEN THE NUMBER OF OUTSTANDING ISSUES AND THE

UNCERTAINTY OF THEIR ULTIMATE DISPOSITION, MANAGEMENT IS UNABLE

TO PREDICT THE MAGNITUDE OF ANY POTENTIAL DETERMINATION OF THE

PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS.

MILNE AND DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. V. STEPHEN

SLESINGER, INC.

ON NOVEMBER 5,

2002, CLARE MILNE, THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A.A. MILNE, AUTHOR

OF THE WINNIE THE POOH BOOKS, AND THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY

DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST STEPHEN

SLESINGER, INC. (SSI) IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. ON

NOVEMBER 4, 2002, MS. MILNE SERVED NOTICES TO SSI AND

THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY TERMINATING A.A. MILNES

PRIOR GRANT OF RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH, EFFECTIVE

NOVEMBER 5, 2004, AND GRANTED ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS TO THE

COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY. IN THEIR LAWSUIT, MS. MILNE AND

THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY SEEK A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, UNDER

UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT LAW, THAT MS. MILNES

TERMINATION NOTICES WERE VALID; THAT SSIS RIGHTS TO WINNIE

THE POOH IN THE UNITED STATES WILL TERMINATE EFFECTIVE

NOVEMBER 5, 2004; THAT UPON TERMINATION OF SSIS

RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT THAT

IS THE SUBJECT OF THE STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY

COMPANY LAWSUIT WILL TERMINATE BY OPERATION OF LAW; AND THAT, AS

OF NOVEMBER 5, 2004, SSI WILL BE ENTITLED TO NO FURTHER

ROYALTIES FOR USES OF WINNIE THE POOH.

AL.

CONSISTING OF PURCHASERS OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK

BETWEEN AUGUST 15, 1997 AND MAY 15, 2002.

SUBSEQUENTLY, AT LEAST NINE SUBSTANTIALLY IDENTICAL LAWSUITS

THE PENDENCY AND POTENTIAL IMPLICATIONS OF THE

STEPHEN

SLESINGER, INC.

LAWSUIT DESCRIBED ABOVE PRIOR TO THE

COMPANYS FILING OF ITS QUARTERLY REPORT ON FORM 10-Q

IN MAY 2002. THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIM THAT THIS

-88-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALLEGED NONDISCLOSURE CONSTITUTED A FRAUD ON THE

MARKET THAT ARTIFICIALLY INFLATED THE COMPANYS STOCK

PRICE, AND CONTEND THAT A DECLINE IN THE STOCK PRICE RESULTED

FROM THE MAY 2002 DISCLOSURE. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK COMPENSATORY

DAMAGES AND/OR RESCISSION FOR THEMSELVES AND ALL MEMBERS OF

THEIR DEFINED CLASS. SEVERAL OF THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED

MOTIONS ASKING THE COURT TO APPOINT LEAD PLAINTIFFS AND COUNSEL,

AND TO CONSOLIDATE THE RELATED ACTIONS INTO A SINGLE CASE.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT CURRENTLY

POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ULTIMATE

RESOLUTION OF THESE LEGAL MATTERS WILL HAVE ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH

FLOWS.

THE COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES,

CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR

CO-DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS INVOLVING COPYRIGHT,

BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE

CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT A MATERIAL

IMPACT TO ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH

FLOWS BY REASON OF THESE ACTIONS.

TREASURE PLANET.

THE FILMS

OPENING WEEK BOX OFFICE PERFORMANCE WAS SIGNIFICANTLY LESS THAN

EXPECTATIONS, REQUIRING A DOWNWARD REVISION OF ITS PROJECTED

INITIALLY REPORTED IN ITS NOVEMBER 7, 2002 EARNINGS RELEASE

TO REFLECT THIS CHANGE IN ESTIMATE.
