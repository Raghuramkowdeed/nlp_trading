ADVERTISING TIME, THE BROADCASTING OPERATIONS COMPETE WITH OTHER TELEVISION

NETWORKS, INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATIONS, SUPPLIERS OF CABLE TELEVISION

PROGRAMS AND OTHER ADVERTISING MEDIA SUCH AS NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES AND

BILLBOARDS. THE ABC RADIO NETWORKS LIKEWISE COMPETE WITH OTHER RADIO NETWORKS

AND RADIO PROGRAMMING SERVICES, INDEPENDENT RADIO STATIONS AND OTHER

ADVERTISING MEDIA.

THE COMPANY'S TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS ARE IN COMPETITION WITH OTHER

TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS, CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEMS, SATELLITE TELEVISION

PROGRAM SERVICES, VIDEOCASSETTES, DVDS AND OTHER ADVERTISING MEDIA SUCH AS

NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES AND BILLBOARDS. COMPETITION OCCURS PRIMARILY IN

INDIVIDUAL MARKET AREAS. A TELEVISION STATION IN ONE MARKET DOES NOT COMPETE

DIRECTLY WITH OTHER STATIONS IN OTHER MARKET AREAS.

THE GROWTH IN THE CABLE INDUSTRY'S SHARE OF VIEWERS HAS RESULTED IN

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FOR ADVERTISING REVENUES. IN ADDITION, SPORTS

AND OTHER PROGRAMMING COSTS HAVE INCREASED DUE TO INCREASED COMPETITION. THE

COMPANY'S CABLE NETWORKS, INCLUDING THE RECENTLY ACQUIRED FOX FAMILY WORLDWIDE,

ALSO FACE COMPETITION FOR CARRIAGE BY THE CABLE SERVICE PROVIDERS. THERE IS NO

GUARANTEE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN CONTRACT RENEGOTIATIONS WHEN

CONTRACTS COME UP FOR RENEWAL.

TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CONVERSION OF THE INTERNET GROUP COMMON STOCK)

AND 100% THEREAFTER.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

2001 VS. 2000

AS-REPORTED NET LOSS WAS $158 MILLION COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $920 MILLION

IN THE PRIOR YEAR. NET LOSS AND LOSS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTED TO DISNEY COMMON

STOCK WERE $41 MILLION AND $0.02, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED TO NET INCOME AND

EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTED TO DISNEY COMMON STOCK OF $1.2 BILLION AND $0.57,

RESPECTIVELY, IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE CURRENT YEAR AS-REPORTED NET LOSS INCLUDES

CHARGES FROM THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGES ($278 MILLION OR $0.13

PER DISNEY SHARE) AND RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ($1.45 BILLION OR

$0.52 PER DISNEY SHARE). AS-REPORTED RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE PRE-TAX GAINS ON THE

SALE OF INFOSEEK JAPAN K.K. ($22 MILLION) IN 2001, AND FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS

($243 MILLION), ULTRASEEK CORPORATION ($153 MILLION) AND EUROSPORT ($93

MILLION) IN 2000. EXCLUDING THE CHARGES AND GAINS MENTIONED ABOVE, EARNINGS PER

SHARE ATTRIBUTED TO DISNEY COMMON STOCK WAS $0.63 AND $0.56 FOR THE CURRENT AND

PRIOR YEAR, RESPECTIVELY. RESULTS FOR THE YEAR ALSO REFLECTED LOWER

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND NET INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER AND HIGHER

EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED SEGMENT

OPERATING INCOME AND HIGHER CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED EXPENSES. LOWER

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS REFLECTED THE WRITE-OFF OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE CLOSURE OF THE GO.COM PORTAL BUSINESS IN THE SECOND QUARTER

OF THE CURRENT YEAR, CERTAIN INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOMING FULLY AMORTIZED IN THE

FIRST QUARTER AND A REDUCTION IN INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO THE SALE OF

FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS, ULTRASEEK AND EUROSPORT IN FISCAL 2000. DECREASES IN

NET INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER WERE DRIVEN BY GAINS ON THE SALE OF CERTAIN

INVESTMENTS, LOWER INTEREST RATES AND LOWER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES THROUGHOUT

MOST OF THE YEAR. HIGHER EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES REFLECTED IMPROVED

RESULTS FROM CABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS INCLUDING LIFETIME TELEVISION, THE

HISTORY CHANNEL AND A&E; TELEVISION AND CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL CABLE EQUITY

INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY START-UP LOSSES INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH

NEW INVESTMENTS. DECREASED SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME REFLECTED LOWER MEDIA

NETWORKS AND PARKS & RESORTS RESULTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVEMENTS AT

STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS. INCREASED CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED

SHARED EXPENSES WERE DRIVEN BY COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL STRATEGIC

INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO IMPROVE OVERALL COMPANY-WIDE EFFICIENCY AND PROMOTE THE

DISNEY BRAND.

ON OCTOBER 24, 2001, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED FOX FAMILY WORLDWIDE, INC. ("FFW")

FOR $5.2 BILLION, INCLUDING $2.9 BILLION IN CASH, PLUS THE ASSUMPTION OF $2.3

BILLION IN DEBT (SEE NOTE 15 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS).

THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT THE INCOME STATEMENT FOR 2002 WILL INCLUDE THE

IMPACT OF FFW MERGER-RELATED AND INTEGRATION EXPENSES; AMORTIZATION OF

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, TO THE EXTENT IDENTIFIED, VALUED AND DEEMED TO HAVE

DETERMINABLE LIVES AS PART OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION; INCREASED INTEREST

EXPENSE FROM THE FINANCING OF THE ACQUISITION AND INCREASED REVENUES AND

EXPENSES FROM THE ACQUIRED OPERATIONS.

THE BALANCE SHEET IMPACT OF THE ACQUISITION IS EXPECTED TO REFLECT FFW'S

HISTORICAL CARRYING AMOUNTS, EXCLUDING THE FOX KID'S NETWORK, MODIFIED BY

PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS TO REFLECT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FFW'S

HISTORICAL CARRYING AMOUNTS AND FAIR VALUE; SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, INCLUDING GOODWILL; ADDITIONAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT REFLECT THE

FAIR VALUE OF CONTINGENCIES, EXECUTORY CONTRACTS AND OTHER COMMITMENTS, AND

INCREASED DEBT FROM FUNDING FOR THE PURCHASE.

2000 VS. 1999

AS-REPORTED EARNINGS AND EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTED TO DISNEY COMMON

STOCK, DECREASED 8% TO $1.2 BILLION AND $0.57, RESPECTIVELY, DRIVEN BY HIGHER

AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND INCOME TAXES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASED SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AND EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES AND

LOWER NET INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER. INCREASED AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE

ASSETS RESULTED FROM

-22-

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF INFOSEEK CORPORATION

(INFOSEEK). HIGHER SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH AT MEDIA

NETWORKS AND PARKS & RESORTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN THE OTHER

SEGMENTS. EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER INFOSEEK

EQUITY LOSSES IN FISCAL 1999 AS WELL AS IMPROVED RESULTS FROM THE COMPANY'S

CABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. NET INTEREST EXPENSE AND OTHER DECREASED DUE TO LOWER

AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST RATES IN FISCAL

2000. LOWER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES REFLECTED INCREASED CASH FLOW.

FISCAL 2000 INCLUDES LOWER RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, DISCUSSED

MORE FULLY BELOW, AND HIGHER GAIN ON THE SALE OF BUSINESSES. THE INCREASE IN

THE GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES REFLECTS GAINS ON THE SALE OF FAIRCHILD,

ULTRASEEK AND EUROSPORT TOTALING $243 MILLION, $153 MILLION AND $93 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, IN FISCAL 2000 AS COMPARED TO THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF STARWAVE

TOTALING $345 MILLION IN FISCAL 1999. AS-REPORTED NET INCOME INCLUDING

RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND GAIN ON THE SALE OF BUSINESS WAS $920

MILLION, INCLUDING A LOSS OF $276 MILLION ATTRIBUTED TO THE INTERNET GROUP.

AS-REPORTED EARNINGS ATTRIBUTED TO DISNEY COMMON STOCK WERE $1.2 BILLION OR

$0.57 PER SHARE IN FISCAL 2000 VERSUS $1.3 BILLION OR $0.62 PER SHARE IN FISCAL

1999.

======    ===     ====

IN 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TOTALING

$1.45 BILLION. THE GO.COM CHARGE IS FOR THE CLOSURE OF THE GO.COM PORTAL

BUSINESS AND INCLUDES A NON-CASH WRITE-OFF OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS TOTALING $820

MILLION (SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). THE INVESTMENT

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS FOR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

CERTAIN INTERNET INVESTMENTS. THE WORKFORCE REDUCTION CHARGES ARE PRIMARILY FOR

SEVERANCE COSTS AND ARE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY BELOW. THE DISNEYQUEST AND DISNEY

STORE CLOSURE CHARGES ARE FOR THE CLOSURE OF THE CHICAGO DISNEYQUEST FACILITY

AND APPROXIMATELY 100 DISNEY STORES AND INCLUDES THE WRITE-DOWN OF FIXED ASSETS

AND LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, LEASEHOLD TERMINATION COSTS, SEVERANCE AND OTHER

RELATED CLOSURE COSTS. THE ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS FOR CERTAIN LONG-LIVED

ASSETS, PRIMARILY AT THE DISNEY STORE AND DISNEY CATALOG. THESE ASSETS WERE

EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT UNDER A HELD FOR USE MODEL DUE TO DECLINING CASH

FLOWS. FAIR VALUE WAS GENERALLY DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2001, THE COMPANY INITIATED A PLAN TO

ELIMINATE 4,000 FULL-TIME JOBS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF VOLUNTARY AND

INVOLUNTARY REDUCTIONS. THE REDUCTION AFFECTED

-23-

EMPLOYEES IN ALL BUSINESS UNITS AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. THE $111 MILLION OF

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORKFORCE REDUCTION CONSIST PRIMARILY OF SEVERANCE

COSTS AND WRITE-OFFS OF IDLED FACILITIES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, THE COMPANY

HAD SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED ITS WORKFORCE REDUCTION AND PAID TERMINATION

BENEFITS TOTALING $92 MILLION.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, APPROXIMATELY $118 MILLION OF THE RESTRUCTURING

AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REMAINED AS AN ACCRUED LIABILITY ON THE BALANCE SHEET,

OF WHICH $19 MILLION RELATED TO THE WORKFORCE REDUCTION AND $21 MILLION IS FROM

PRIOR-YEAR RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. THE MAJORITY OF THIS AMOUNT IS EXPECTED TO BE

PAID IN FISCAL 2002.

IN 2000, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AMOUNTED TO $92 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

WRITE-DOWNS OF CERTAIN INTERNET INVESTMENTS AND AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWN

AT TOYSMART.COM IN CONNECTION WITH ITS CLOSURE.

IN 1999, THE COMPANY RECORDED RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TOTALING

$172 MILLION. THE CHARGES INCLUDED $132 MILLION FOR SEVERANCE AND OTHER CHARGES

AND $40 MILLION RELATED TO LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS. THE RESTRUCTURING

CHARGES INCLUDED SEVERANCE AND LEASE AND OTHER CONTRACT CANCELLATION COSTS,

PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF OPERATIONS IN THE COMPANY'S

BROADCASTING, TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND REGIONAL ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES AS

WELL AS NON-CASH CHARGES FOR WRITE-DOWNS OF UNDERUTILIZED ASSETS.

FISCAL 2002 OUTLOOK

THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11TH AND THEIR AFTERMATH

COUPLED WITH THE ALREADY SOFT ECONOMY WILL CONTINUE TO INFLUENCE ITS OPERATING

RESULTS INTO FISCAL 2002. THIS IMPACT IS LIKELY TO BE MOST SIGNIFICANT IN

CERTAIN OF THE MEDIA NETWORKS OPERATIONS AND PARKS & RESORTS. THE MEDIA

NETWORKS ADVERTISING-SUPPORTED BUSINESSES, SUCH AS THE TELEVISION AND RADIO

NETWORK AND STATIONS, ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE DECLINES IN REVENUES DUE TO THE SOFT

ADVERTISING MARKETPLACE, CONTINUED RATINGS DECREASES AND A POTENTIAL INCREASE

IN NEWS PREEMPTIONS AND HIGHER NEWS PRODUCTION COSTS. IN CABLE, THE SLOW

ECONOMY AND A SURPLUS OF INVENTORY ARE RESULTING IN DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON

ADVERTISING RATES. PARKS & RESORTS OPERATIONS ARE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED BY THE

DOWNTURN IN LEISURE TRAVEL AND LOWER CONSUMER CONFIDENCE ESPECIALLY AS COMPARED

TO THE RECORD SETTING FIRST QUARTER THE SEGMENT ACHIEVED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. TO

DATE, WALT DISNEY WORLD ATTENDANCE IS DOWN ROUGHLY 25% VERSUS THE FIRST QUARTER

OF LAST YEAR. WE EXPECT HOTEL OCCUPANCY TO BE DOWN BY APPROXIMATELY 20 AND 15

PERCENTAGE POINTS FOR WALT DISNEY WORLD AND DISNEYLAND, RESPECTIVELY, COMPARED

TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF LAST YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT SOFT

RETAIL SALES AND WEAK CONSUMER CONFIDENCE ARE LIKELY TO AFFECT ITS CONSUMER

PRODUCTS BUSINESS.

AS SUCH, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS OPERATING INCOME IN THE FIRST QUARTER

OF FISCAL 2002 COULD BE SOMEWHAT LESS THAN HALF THAT OF THE STRONG FIRST

QUARTER RESULTS OF THE PRIOR YEAR. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE FIRST QUARTER

WILL REPRESENT THE MOST DIFFICULT YEAR-OVER-YEAR COMPARISON. WHILE THE FUTURE

IS UNCERTAIN, THE COMPANY SHOULD EXPERIENCE AN IMPROVED BUSINESS CLIMATE IN THE

LAST THREE FISCAL QUARTERS OF 2002, WITH OPERATING INCOME DECLINES OF AS MUCH

AS 10 TO 15 PERCENT FOR THOSE LATER THREE PERIODS COMBINED VERSUS THE PRIOR

YEAR.

THE COMPANY IS TAKING A VARIETY OF MEASURES TO MITIGATE THESE IMPACTS,

INCLUDING A PLANNED REDUCTION OF FISCAL 2002 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. IN THE PARKS

& RESORTS BUSINESSES, MITIGATION EFFORTS INCLUDE REDUCING MAN-HOURS, CLOSING

NON-ESSENTIAL FOOD AND BEVERAGE LOCATIONS, INSTITUTING A HIRING FREEZE AND

DELAYING NON-ESSENTIAL REFURBISHMENTS. IN MEDIA NETWORKS, ALL BUSINESSES ARE

UNDERTAKING AGGRESSIVE COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES.

IN NOVEMBER 1999, THE COMPANY SOLD FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS WHICH IT HAD

ACQUIRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ABC ACQUISITION IN 1996. IN NOVEMBER 1998, THE

COMPANY ACQUIRED A 43% INTEREST IN INFOSEEK, A PUBLICLY TRADED INTERNET SEARCH

COMPANY AND THEN IN NOVEMBER 1999 ACQUIRED THE REMAINING 57% OF INFOSEEK,

LAUNCHED GO.COM AND CREATED THE DISNEY INTERNET GROUP TRACKING STOCK. ON MARCH

20, 2001, THE COMPANY CONVERTED ITS INTERNET GROUP COMMON STOCK INTO DISNEY

COMMON STOCK AND CLOSED THE GO.COM PORTAL BUSINESS. TO ENHANCE COMPARABILITY,

THE UNAUDITED PRO FORMA INFORMATION THAT FOLLOWS PRESENTS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS AS IF THE FAIRCHILD DISPOSITION, THE COMPLETION OF THE INFOSEEK

ACQUISITION, THE CONVERSION OF THE INTERNET GROUP COMMON STOCK, THE CLOSURE OF

THE GO.COM PORTAL BUSINESS AND THE ADOPTION OF SOP 00-2 (SEE NOTES 1 AND 2 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) HAD OCCURRED AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL

INFORMATION IS NOT NECESSARILY REFLECTIVE OF THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAD

THESE EVENTS ACTUALLY OCCURRED AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2000, NOR IS IT

DISNEYVACATIONS.COM WILL BE REPORTED IN THE PARKS & RESORTS SEGMENT. ALSO

DURING THE YEAR, THE DISNEY STORE CATALOG AND THE DISNEY STORE ONLINE WERE

REASSIGNED FROM THE INTERNET GROUP TO CONSUMER PRODUCTS. THESE CHANGES HAVE

BEEN REFLECTED IN THE FISCAL 2001 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND PRIOR-YEAR AMOUNTS

HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO REFLECT THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

REVENUES DECREASED 2%, OR $232 MILLION, TO $9.6 BILLION, DRIVEN BY DECREASES

OF $566 MILLION AT BROADCASTING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES OF $334 MILLION

AT THE CABLE NETWORKS. THE DECREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER RATINGS

AND THE SOFT ADVERTISING MARKET AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND THE COMPANY'S

OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, REVENUE DECLINES

AT THE TELEVISION NETWORK REFLECTED LOWER SPORTS ADVERTISING REVENUES DUE TO

ABC AIRING THE SUPER BOWL IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE AT THE CABLE NETWORKS

WAS DRIVEN BY ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL RATE ADJUSTMENTS AT ESPN COMBINED WITH

SUBSCRIBER GROWTH AT ESPN, THE DISNEY CHANNEL DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE SOFT ADVERTISING MARKET DURING THE YEAR. SUBSCRIBER

GROWTH AT THE DISNEY CHANNEL REFLECTED INCREASING SATELLITE (DBS) AND DIGITAL

SUBSCRIBERS AND THE CONTINUING CONVERSION OF THE DISNEY CHANNEL FROM A PREMIUM

TO A BASIC SERVICE.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 13%, OR $257 MILLION, TO $1.8 BILLION,

DRIVEN BY A DECREASE OF $305 MILLION AT BROADCASTING RESULTING PRIMARILY FROM

DECREASED REVENUES AND HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN

INCREASE OF $48 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS, DRIVEN BY REVENUE GROWTH. COSTS

AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS AND AMORTIZATION,

PRODUCTION COSTS, DISTRIBUTION AND SELLING EXPENSES AND LABOR COSTS, REMAINED

FLAT FOR THE YEAR, BUT INCREASED AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE. THE COMPANY

EXPERIENCED HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS AT ESPN, THE PRIMETIME ABC TELEVISION

NETWORK AND THE COMPANY'S OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO OPERATIONS AND

START-UP COSTS AT THE INTERNATIONAL DISNEY CHANNELS, OFFSET BY LOWER SPORTS

PROGRAMMING COSTS AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK DUE TO HIGHER COSTS FOR THE

SUPER BOWL AND TWO ADDITIONAL NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE (NFL) REGULAR SEASON

GAMES IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND LOWER COSTS AT THE INTERNET GROUP DUE TO THE

CLOSURE OF TOYSMART.COM IN THE PRIOR YEAR AND COST SAVING INITIATIVES.

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF

BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING INCLUDING THE NFL, MAJOR

LEAGUE BASEBALL (MLB) AND THE NATIONAL HOCKEY LEAGUE (NHL). THE COSTS OF THESE

CONTRACTS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. THE COMPANY HAS

IMPLEMENTED A VARIETY OF STRATEGIES, INCLUDING MARKETING EFFORTS, TO REDUCE THE

IMPACT OF THE HIGHER

-28-

COSTS. THE IMPACT OF THESE CONTRACTS ON THE COMPANY'S RESULTS OVER THE

REMAINING TERM OF THE CONTRACTS IS DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING

EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES.

THE COSTS OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE BASED ON THE RATIO OF

EACH PERIOD'S GROSS REVENUES TO ESTIMATED TOTAL GROSS REVENUES OVER THE

REMAINING CONTRACT PERIOD. ESTIMATES OF TOTAL GROSS REVENUES CAN CHANGE

SIGNIFICANTLY AND, ACCORDINGLY, THEY ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND AMORTIZATION

AND CARRYING AMOUNTS ARE ADJUSTED, IF NECESSARY. SUCH ADJUSTMENTS COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

THE COMPANY HAS INVESTMENTS IN CABLE OPERATIONS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS

UNCONSOLIDATED EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS OPERATING INCOME

FROM CABLE TELEVISION ACTIVITIES, WHICH COMPRISE THE CABLE NETWORKS AND THE

(1) AMOUNTS INCLUDE THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF EUROSPORT IN FISCAL 2000. EXCLUDING

DISNEY'S SHARE OF THE GAIN, CABLE TELEVISION OPERATING INCOME FOR THE YEAR

ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2000 WAS $1,126 MILLION.

WE BELIEVE THAT OPERATING INCOME FROM CABLE TELEVISION ACTIVITIES PROVIDES

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION USEFUL IN ANALYZING THE UNDERLYING BUSINESS RESULTS.

HOWEVER, OPERATING INCOME FROM CABLE TELEVISION ACTIVITIES IS A NON-GAAP

FINANCIAL METRIC AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN ADDITION TO, NOT AS A SUBSTITUTE

FOR, SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME.

THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF CABLE TELEVISION OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 2%, OR

$28 MILLION, TO $1.2 BILLION. EXCLUDING THE PRIOR-YEAR GAIN ON EUROSPORT, THE

COMPANY'S SHARE OF CABLE TELEVISION OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 9%, REFLECTING

HIGHER AFFILIATE REVENUES AT THE CABLE NETWORKS DRIVEN BY ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL

RATE ADJUSTMENTS AND STRONG SUBSCRIBER GROWTH, INCLUDING THE CONVERSION OF THE

DISNEY CHANNEL FROM A PREMIUM TO A BASIC SERVICE, AND PROFIT INCREASES FROM

CABLE EQUITY INVESTMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS AND THE

SOFT ADVERTISING MARKET AT THE CABLE NETWORK.

2000 VS. 1999

REVENUES INCREASED 23%, OR $1.8 BILLION, TO $9.8 BILLION, DRIVEN BY

INCREASES OF $1.2 BILLION AT BROADCASTING AND $636 MILLION AT THE CABLE

NETWORKS. BROADCASTING REVENUE GROWTH REFLECTED

-29-

INCREASED ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE TELEVISION NETWORKS AND THE COMPANY'S

OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS DUE TO A STRONG ADVERTISING MARKET, THE CONTINUED

SUCCESS OF WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE AND HIGHER OVERALL RATINGS ON NETWORK

PROGRAMMING. TELEVISION STATION REVENUE GROWTH ALSO BENEFITED FROM HIGHER SPOT

ADVERTISING RATES DRIVEN BY THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK PLACING FIRST IN THE MAY

AND FEBRUARY SWEEPS. ADDITIONALLY, THE STRONG ADVERTISING MARKET RESULTED IN

REVENUE GROWTH AT THE RADIO NETWORKS AND STATIONS. REVENUE GROWTH ALSO

REFLECTED HIGHER ADVERTISING AND SPONSORSHIP REVENUES AT THE INTERNET GROUP, AS

WELL AS THE OPERATIONS OF INFOSEEK, WHICH WERE CONSOLIDATED INTO THE INTERNET

GROUP BEGINNING NOVEMBER 1999. CABLE NETWORK REVENUE GROWTH REFLECTED INCREASED

ADVERTISING REVENUES DRIVEN BY A STRONG ADVERTISING MARKET AND HIGHER AFFILIATE

FEES REFLECTING CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES AND SUBSCRIBER GROWTH. INTERNATIONAL

EXPANSION AT THE DISNEY CHANNEL ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO INCREASED REVENUES.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 31%, OR $473 MILLION, TO $2.0 BILLION,

DRIVEN BY INCREASES OF $399 MILLION AT BROADCASTING AND $74 MILLION AT THE

CABLE NETWORKS, RESULTING FROM REVENUE GROWTH AT BOTH BROADCASTING AND CABLE

NETWORKS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED COSTS AND EXPENSES. COSTS AND EXPENSES,

WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS AND AMORTIZATION, PRODUCTION

COSTS, DISTRIBUTION AND SELLING EXPENSES AND LABOR COSTS, INCREASED 21%, OR

$1.4 BILLION, DRIVEN BY HIGHER SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS AT THE TELEVISION AND

CABLE NETWORKS, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO NFL, MLB AND NHL BROADCASTS. IN

ADDITION, HIGHER COSTS AND EXPENSES REFLECTED START-UP COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

THE LAUNCH OF VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL DISNEY CHANNELS AND THE JANUARY LAUNCH OF

SOAPNET. COSTS AND EXPENSES AT THE INTERNET GROUP ALSO INCREASED DUE TO WEBSITE

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, GROWTH IN INFRASTRUCTURE DUE TO THE EXPANSION OF THE

BUSINESS, THE OPERATIONS OF TOYSMART.COM AND THE OPERATIONS OF INFOSEEK.

DISNEY AND THE GRAND CALIFORNIAN HOTEL DURING THE SECOND QUARTER DROVE

INCREASED ATTENDANCE, HIGHER OCCUPIED ROOM NIGHTS AND INCREASED GUEST SPENDING.

DISNEY CRUISE LINE'S RESULTS REFLECTED THE STRENGTH OF THE 7-DAY CRUISE PACKAGE

THAT WAS INTRODUCED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. AT WALT DISNEY

WORLD, DECREASED REVENUES WERE DRIVEN BY DECREASED ATTENDANCE AND LOWER

OCCUPIED ROOM NIGHTS REFLECTING THE PRIOR YEAR SUCCESS OF THE MILLENNIUM

CELEBRATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED GUEST SPENDING. BOTH THE DISNEYLAND

RESORT AND WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT WERE IMPACTED BY PARK CLOSURES ON SEPTEMBER

11/TH/ AND FROM LOWER ATTENDANCE AND HOTEL OCCUPANCY DUE TO CANCELLATIONS AND

REDUCED TRAVEL DURING THE LAST THREE WEEKS OF SEPTEMBER.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 2%, OR $29 MILLION, TO $1.6 BILLION,

DRIVEN BY INCREASED COSTS AT THE DISNEYLAND RESORT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REVENUE

COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF LABOR, COSTS OF MERCHANDISE,

FOOD AND BEVERAGES SOLD, DEPRECIATION, REPAIRS AND MAINTENANCE, ENTERTAINMENT

AND MARKETING AND SALES EXPENSE, INCREASED 4% OR $224 MILLION. HIGHER COSTS AT

THE PRIOR YEAR; AND $35 MILLION FROM INCREASED ATTENDANCE AND GUEST SPENDING AT

DISNEYLAND. INCREASED GUEST SPENDING AND RECORD ATTENDANCE AT THE WALT DISNEY

WORLD RESORT WERE DRIVEN BY THE ONGOING MILLENNIUM CELEBRATION AND RECORD

OCCUPIED ROOM NIGHTS REFLECTED THE OPENING OF THE ALL-STAR MOVIES RESORT IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR. AT DISNEYLAND, THE 45/TH/ ANNIVERSARY

CELEBRATION AND THE STRENGTH OF THE ANNUAL PASSPORT PROGRAM DROVE INCREASED

ATTENDANCE AND GUEST SPENDING.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 8%, OR $121 MILLION, TO $1.6 BILLION,

DRIVEN BY REVENUE GROWTH AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT, IMPROVED RESULTS AT

DISNEY CRUISE LINE AND HIGHER GUEST SPENDING AND ATTENDANCE AT DISNEYLAND,

EXPANDED OPERATIONS AT DISNEY CRUISE LINE AS A RESULT OF THE ADDITION OF THE

SECOND SHIP AND INCREASED VOLUME AT DISNEYLAND DUE TO THE 45/TH/ ANNIVERSARY

CELEBRATION, AS WELL AS PRE-OPENING COSTS AT DISNEY'S CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE.

STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT

REVENUES INCREASED 2%, OR $95 MILLION, TO $6.1 BILLION, DRIVEN BY GROWTH OF

$316 MILLION IN WORLDWIDE HOME VIDEO AND $126 MILLION IN STAGE PLAYS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A DECLINE OF $306 MILLION IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE

DISTRIBUTION. IMPROVEMENTS IN WORLDWIDE HOME VIDEO REVENUES REFLECTED STRONG

DISNEY/PIXAR'S TOY STORY 2,  DINOSAURS, THE EMPEROR'S NEW GROOVE AND LADY & THE

TRAMP II AND STRONGER PERFORMING LIVE-ACTION TITLES INCLUDING SPY KIDS, SCARY

MOVIE, GONE IN 60 SECONDS AND REMEMBER THE TITANS. GROWTH IN STAGE PLAYS

PERFORMANCE OF AIDA. IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION, THE

SUCCESS OF PEARL HARBOR, SPY KIDS AND PRINCESS DIARIES, FACED DIFFICULT

COMPARISONS TO PRIOR YEAR TITLES, WHICH INCLUDED TOY STORY 2, TARZAN, DINOSAUR,

SCARY MOVIE AND THE SIXTH SENSE.

ON A PRO FORMA BASIS, SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED $184 MILLION, TO

$260 MILLION, DUE TO INCREASES IN WORLDWIDE HOME VIDEO AND STAGE PLAYS. COSTS

ALSO INCREASED DUE TO MORE PRODUCTIONS IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

ON AN AS-REPORTED BASIS, SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED $134 MILLION, TO

$260 MILLION, REFLECTING THE ITEMS DESCRIBED ABOVE, AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF

MARKETING COSTS AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

2000 VS. 1999

REVENUES DECREASED 3%, OR $165 MILLION, TO $6.0 BILLION, DRIVEN BY DECLINES

OF $206 MILLION IN NETWORK TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION, $168 MILLION

IN WORLDWIDE HOME VIDEO AND $58

-31-

MILLION IN DOMESTIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

GROWTH OF $197 MILLION IN INTERNATIONAL THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION

AND $88 MILLION IN STAGE PLAYS. THE DECLINE IN NETWORK TELEVISION PRODUCTION

AND DISTRIBUTION REVENUES PRIMARILY REFLECTED THE END OF PRODUCTION OF HOME

IMPROVEMENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH WAS A SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR TO REVENUES.

THE DECLINE IN WORLDWIDE HOME VIDEO REVENUES REFLECTED FEWER UNIT SALES IN THE

CURRENT YEAR, DESPITE THE SUCCESSFUL RELEASES OF TARZAN AND LITTLE MERMAID II.

RETURN TO SEA, AS THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED THE COMBINATION OF LION KING II.

SIMBA'S PRIDE, MULAN, ARMAGEDDON AND DISNEY/PIXAR'S A BUG'S LIFE. IN DOMESTIC

THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION, THE SUCCESS OF SCARY MOVIE, DINOSAUR

INCREASED DUE TO EXPANSION OF THE LION KING INTO ADDITIONAL CITIES, THE LAUNCH

OF AIDA AND THE RE-LAUNCH OF THE BEAUTY AND THE BEAST NATIONAL TOUR.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 22%, OR $36 MILLION, TO $126 MILLION, DUE

TO DECLINES IN WORLDWIDE HOME VIDEO AND NETWORK TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND

DISTRIBUTION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL THEATRICAL MOTION

PICTURE DISTRIBUTION AND STAGE PLAYS. COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST

PRIMARILY OF PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION, DISTRIBUTION AND SELLING EXPENSES,

PRODUCT COSTS, LABOR AND LEASEHOLD EXPENSES, DECREASED 2% OR $129 MILLION.

PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION DECREASED IN NETWORK TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND

DISTRIBUTION REFLECTING THE PRODUCTION OF HOME IMPROVEMENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

IN WORLDWIDE HOME VIDEO, DISTRIBUTION AND SELLING COSTS AND PRODUCTION COST

AMORTIZATION DECREASED DUE TO A REDUCTION IN VIDEOTAPE UNIT SALES COMPARED TO

THE PRIOR YEAR. THE SIXTH SENSE, WHICH DROVE HIGHER PARTICIPATION COSTS IN

DOMESTIC THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, HAD A

SIMILAR IMPACT IN INTERNATIONAL THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION IN THE

CURRENT YEAR. COST INCREASES IN INTERNATIONAL THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE

DISTRIBUTION ALSO REFLECTED HIGHER OVERALL PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION. STAGE

PLAYS OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCREASED DRIVEN BY REVENUE INCREASES.

CONSUMER PRODUCTS

DISPOSITION OF FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE PRIOR YEAR.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 4%, OR $16 MILLION, TO $401 MILLION,

PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY BENEFITS FROM COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY DECLINES AT THE DISNEY STORES IN NORTH AMERICA. COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH

CONSIST PRIMARILY OF LABOR, PRODUCT COSTS, INCLUDING PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS,

DISTRIBUTION AND SELLING EXPENSES AND LEASEHOLD EXPENSES, DECREASED 7% OR $174

MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SALES VOLUME AT THE DISNEY STORES IN NORTH

AMERICA, DECREASED CATALOG CIRCULATION AND ADVERTISING COSTS AND THE IMPACT OF

COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES INCLUDING THE DISNEY STORE IN EUROPE.

REVENUES DECREASED 12%, OR $364 MILLION, TO $2.8 BILLION, REFLECTING

DECLINES OF $163 MILLION AT FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS, $135 MILLION IN WORLDWIDE

MERCHANDISE LICENSING AND PUBLISHING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH OF $22 MILLION

AT DISNEY INTERACTIVE. REVENUES DECREASED AT FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS AS IT WAS

SOLD IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2000. LOWER MERCHANDISE LICENSING AND

PUBLISHING REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECLINES DOMESTICALLY AND IN

EUROPE. DISNEY INTERACTIVE REVENUES INCREASED

-32-

DUE TO THE SUCCESS OF THE WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE VIDEO GAMES, POOH

LEARNING TITLES AND THE TOY STORY 2 ACTION GAME.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 35%, OR $206 MILLION, TO $386 MILLION,

REFLECTING DECLINES IN WORLDWIDE MERCHANDISE LICENSING AND PUBLISHING AND THE

SALE OF FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES AT THE DISNEY

STORES, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY A REDUCTION IN COSTS, AND AT DISNEY INTERACTIVE.

COSTS AND EXPENSES DECREASED 6% OR $158 MILLION. COST DECREASES AT THE DISNEY

STORES, WHICH REFLECTED WRITE-DOWNS OF INVENTORY IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN ADVERTISING COSTS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS DECREASED 19%, OR $707 MILLION, TO $3.0 BILLION,

REFLECTING DECREASED PRETAX INCOME BEFORE NON-CASH CHARGES, INCREASED PAYMENTS

FOR TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE NFL

PAYMENTS AND INCREASED LICENSE FEES FOR PRIMETIME PROGRAMMING AND THE TIMING OF

THE PAYMENTS OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

LOWER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED PROCEEDS FROM

THE SALE OF RECEIVABLES AT DISNEY VACATION CLUB. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER NET INCOME BEFORE NON-CASH CHARGES.

DURING THE YEAR, THE COMPANY INVESTED $1.8 BILLION IN PARKS, RESORTS AND

OTHER PROPERTIES. THESE EXPENDITURES REFLECTED CONTINUED EXPANSION ACTIVITIES

RELATED TO DISNEY'S CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE AND CERTAIN RESORT FACILITIES AT THE

WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT. THE DECREASE FROM THE PRIOR YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO

LOWER SPENDING ON DISNEY'S CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE, WHICH OPENED IN FEBRUARY 2001.

DURING THE YEAR, THE COMPANY INVESTED $480 MILLION TO ACQUIRE THE COPYRIGHT

FOR CERTAIN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, RADIO STATION AND PUBLISHING ASSETS AND THE

RIGHTS TO A MUSIC LIBRARY.

IN FISCAL 2001, INVESTING ACTIVITIES ALSO INCLUDED $137 MILLION OF CASH

PROCEEDS GENERATED PRIMARILY FROM THE SALE OF INFOSEEK JAPAN, K.K.

ADDITIONALLY, CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS RESULTED PRIMARILY

FROM THE SALE OF KNIGHT-RIDDER, INC. SHARES WHICH WERE ACQUIRED IN CONNECTION

WITH THE DISPOSITION OF CERTAIN PUBLISHING OPERATIONS. DURING FISCAL 2000,

INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCLUDED CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF FAIRCHILD

PUBLICATIONS AND EUROSPORT. FISCAL 2000 CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF

INVESTMENTS WERE DRIVEN BY THE SALE OF INKTOMI SHARES ACQUIRED THROUGH THE

DISPOSITION OF ULTRASEEK.

DURING 1998, THE COMPANY'S BOARD OF DIRECTORS DECIDED TO MOVE TO AN ANNUAL,

RATHER THAN QUARTERLY, DIVIDEND POLICY TO REDUCE COSTS AND SIMPLIFY PAYMENTS TO

THE MORE THAN 2.7 MILLION STOCKHOLDERS OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK. ACCORDINGLY,

THERE WAS NO DIVIDEND PAYMENT DURING THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 1999. THE

COMPANY PAID A $434 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.21 PER DISNEY SHARE) DURING THE FIRST

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2000 APPLICABLE TO FISCAL 1999 AND PAID A $438 MILLION

DIVIDEND ($0.21 PER DISNEY SHARE) DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF THE CURRENT YEAR

APPLICABLE TO FISCAL 2000. ON NOVEMBER 27, 2001, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

DECLARED A CASH DIVIDEND, APPLICABLE TO FISCAL 2001, OF $0.21 PER SHARE, TO BE

PAID ON DECEMBER 21, 2001, TO STOCKHOLDERS AT THE CLOSE OF BUSINESS DECEMBER 7,

2001.

DURING THE YEAR, THE COMPANY REPAID APPROXIMATELY $2.8 BILLION OF TERM DEBT,

WHICH EITHER MATURED OR WAS CALLED DURING THE YEAR, AND REDUCED ITS COMMERCIAL

PAPER BORROWINGS BY $186 MILLION. THESE REPAYMENTS WERE FUNDED BY PROCEEDS OF

$3.1 BILLION CONSISTING OF $2.5 BILLION OF GLOBAL BONDS AND $50 MILLION OF

FIXED-RATE NOTES ISSUED UNDER THE U.S. SHELF REGISTRATION, AND $530 MILLION OF

FIXED-RATE NOTES ISSUED UNDER THE EURO MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM. THESE

BORROWINGS HAVE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE

SWAPS, RANGING FROM 3.5% TO 5.9% AND MATURITIES IN FISCAL 2003 THROUGH FISCAL

2016. SEE NOTE 5 OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED

INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANY'S BORROWINGS.

-33-

IN AUGUST 2001, THE COMPANY FILED A NEW U.S. SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT,

WHICH REPLACED THE EXISTING U.S. SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT. AS OF SEPTEMBER

30, 2001, THE COMPANY HAD THE ABILITY TO BORROW UNDER THE U.S. SHELF

REGISTRATION STATEMENT AND A EURO MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM, WHICH COLLECTIVELY

PERMITTED THE ISSUANCE OF UP TO APPROXIMATELY $8.1 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL DEBT

OR VARIOUS OTHER SECURITIES.

COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 TOTALED

$754 MILLION, WITH MATURITIES OF UP TO ONE YEAR, SUPPORTED BY A $2.25 BILLION

BANK FACILITY DUE IN 2002 AND A $2.25 BILLION BANK FACILITY DUE IN 2005. THESE

BANK FACILITIES ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS AT THE LIBOR-BASED RATES PLUS A SPREAD,

DEPENDING UPON THE COMPANY'S PUBLIC DEBT RATING. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, THE

COMPANY HAD NOT BORROWED AGAINST THESE BANK FACILITIES.

TOTAL COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE BROADCAST PROGRAMMING APPROXIMATED $13.2

BILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $10.1 BILLION RELATED TO

SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, PRIMARILY NFL, COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND MLB.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THIS AMOUNT IS PAYABLE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, ESPN AND THE COMPANY'S

TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS TO CONTINUE TO ENTER INTO PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS

TO PURCHASE THE BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR VARIOUS FEATURE FILMS, SPORTS AND OTHER

PROGRAMMING.

DURING THE YEAR, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED APPROXIMATELY 63.9 MILLION SHARES OF

DISNEY COMMON STOCK AND 1.8 MILLION SHARES OF INTERNET GROUP COMMON STOCK FOR

APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION AND $10 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2001, THE COMPANY WAS AUTHORIZED TO PURCHASE UP TO APPROXIMATELY 330 MILLION

SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK.

ON OCTOBER 24, 2001, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED FOX FAMILY WORLDWIDE FOR $5.2

BILLION, INCLUDING $2.9 BILLION IN CASH AND THE ASSUMPTION OF $2.3 BILLION IN

DEBT AND PREFERRED STOCK. THE COMPANY FUNDED THE ACQUISITION WITH CASH ON HAND

AS WELL AS SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCES. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS TOTALING

APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $675 MILLION FOR CERTAIN MLB

GAMES THROUGH 2006.

FOLLOWING THE ACQUISITION OF FOX FAMILY WORLDWIDE, THE COMPANY HAD

COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING OF APPROXIMATELY $3.8 BILLION SUPPORTED

BY BANK FACILITIES TOTALING $4.5 BILLION AND CAPACITY TO RAISE AN ADDITIONAL

$7.1 BILLION UNDER ITS U.S. SHELF REGISTRATION AND ITS EURO MEDIUM-TERM NOTE

PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS

CASH, OTHER LIQUID ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO EQUITY CAPITAL

MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO

FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO

THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER,

THE COMPANY'S OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAN BE

IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL. IN ADDITION TO

MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE COMPANY'S BORROWING COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT

AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE

BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON CERTAIN CREDIT MEASURES SUCH AS INTEREST

COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS.

OTHER MATTERS

CONVERSION TO THE EURO CURRENCY

ON JANUARY 1, 1999, CERTAIN MEMBER COUNTRIES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION

ESTABLISHED FIXED CONVERSION RATES BETWEEN THEIR EXISTING CURRENCIES AND THE

EUROPEAN UNION'S COMMON CURRENCY (EURO). THE TRANSITION PERIOD FOR THE

INTRODUCTION OF THE EURO ENDS JANUARY 1, 2002. ISSUES FACING THE COMPANY AS A

RESULT OF THE INTRODUCTION OF THE EURO INCLUDE CONVERTING INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS, REASSESSING CURRENCY RISK, NEGOTIATING AND AMENDING

LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND CONTRACTS, AND PROCESSING TAX AND

-34-

ACCOUNTING RECORDS. THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO ADDRESS THESE ISSUES AND DOES

NOT EXPECT THE EURO TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2000, THE COMPANY ADOPTED AICPA STATEMENT OF POSITION

NO. 00-2, ACCOUNTING BY PRODUCERS OR DISTRIBUTORS OF FILMS (SOP 00-2). THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION REFLECT THE IMPACT OF

THE NEW STANDARD COMMENCING OCTOBER 1, 2000 AND THE COMPANY RECORDED A ONE-TIME

AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $228 MILLION REPRESENTING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE

ADOPTION OF SOP 00-2 IN ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE YEAR

ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001.

IN JUNE 1998, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 133 ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES (SFAS 133), SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY SFAS NO.

137 AND SFAS NO. 138. SFAS 133 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO RECORD ALL DERIVATIVES

ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. CHANGES IN DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUES WILL

EITHER BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS OFFSETS TO THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF

RELATED HEDGED ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FIRM COMMITMENTS OR, FOR FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS, DEFERRED AND RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER ACCUMULATED

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS OCCUR AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN

EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF A HEDGING DERIVATIVE'S CHANGE IN FAIR

VALUE WILL BE IMMEDIATELY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS 133 AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2000, AND IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS, THE COMPANY RECORDED A ONE-TIME AFTER-TAX

CHARGE OF $50 MILLION, OR $0.02 PER SHARE, IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

INCOME REPRESENTING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION AND AN AFTER-TAX

UNREALIZED GAIN OF $60 MILLION TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI).

IN JULY 2001, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

NO. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (SFAS 141) AND STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (SFAS 142). THEY ALSO

ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR

OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (SFAS 143), AND

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE

IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (SFAS 144), IN AUGUST AND OCTOBER

2001, RESPECTIVELY.

SFAS 141 REQUIRES ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001 BE

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD. SFAS 141 SUPERSEDED APB OPINION NO.

16, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, AND STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO.

38, ACCOUNTING FOR PREACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES OF PURCHASED ENTERPRISES AND IS

EFFECTIVE FOR ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001.

SFAS 142 ADDRESSES THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR ACQUIRED

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. UNDER THE NEW RULES, THE COMPANY IS NO

LONGER REQUIRED TO AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

INDEFINITE LIVES BUT WILL BE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC TESTING FOR IMPAIRMENT. SFAS

142 SUPERSEDES APB OPINION NO. 17, INTANGIBLE ASSETS. EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1,

2001, THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT SFAS 142 AND IS EVALUATING THE EFFECT THAT SUCH

ADOPTION MAY HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

POSITION.

AS A RESULT OF ADOPTION, A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ITS INTANGIBLE ASSETS WILL

NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED AND ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY'S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS

EXPECTED TO DECREASE SUBSTANTIALLY IN FISCAL 2002. THE IMPACT OF INTANGIBLE

ASSET AMORTIZATION THAT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN AMORTIZED PURSUANT TO SFAS 142

DURING FISCAL 2001 ON DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WAS $0.26.

SFAS 143 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR THE RECOGNITION AND

MEASUREMENT OF AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION AND ITS ASSOCIATED ASSET

RETIREMENT COST. IT ALSO PROVIDES ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR

-35-

LEGAL OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS.

SFAS 143 IS EFFECTIVE IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2002, WITH EARLY

ADOPTION PERMITTED. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 143 WILL

NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL POSITION UPON ADOPTION. THE COMPANY PLANS TO ADOPT SFAS 143 EFFECTIVE

OCTOBER 1, 2002.

SFAS 144 ESTABLISHES A SINGLE ACCOUNTING MODEL FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR

DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. SFAS 144

SUPERSEDED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR

THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF

AND APB OPINION NO. 30, REPORTING THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--REPORTING THE

EFFECTS OF DISPOSAL OF A SEGMENT OF A BUSINESS, AND EXTRAORDINARY, UNUSUAL AND

INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING EVENTS AND TRANSACTIONS. THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 144 ARE

EFFECTIVE IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2001, WITH EARLY

ADOPTION PERMITTED AND, IN GENERAL, ARE TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY. THE

COMPANY PLANS TO ADOPT SFAS 144 EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2001 AND DOES NOT EXPECT

THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR

FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. WE MAY FROM

TIME TO TIME MAKE WRITTEN OR ORAL STATEMENTS THAT ARE "FORWARD-LOOKING,"

INCLUDING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER FILINGS WITH THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND IN REPORTS TO OUR STOCKHOLDERS. SUCH

STATEMENTS MAY, FOR EXAMPLE, EXPRESS EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE

ACTIONS THAT WE MAY TAKE, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING OR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES OR

ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL INCLUDING CHANGES IN DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE MADE ON THE BASIS OF MANAGEMENT'S

VIEWS AND ASSUMPTIONS AS OF THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WILL NECESSARILY COME TO PASS.

FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FOR AN ENTERPRISE AS

LARGE AND COMPLEX AS THE COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY

AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING THE FOLLOWING.

CHANGES IN COMPANY-WIDE OR BUSINESS-UNIT STRATEGIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN

CHANGES IN THE TYPES OR MIX OF BUSINESSES IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED

OR CHOOSES TO INVEST;

CHANGES IN U.S., GLOBAL OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WHICH MAY AFFECT

ATTENDANCE AND SPENDING AT THE COMPANY'S PARKS AND RESORTS, PURCHASES OF

COMPANY-LICENSED CONSUMER PRODUCTS, THE ADVERTISING MARKET FOR BROADCAST AND

CABLE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY'S THEATRICAL

AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT RELEASES;

CHANGES IN U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND EQUITY MARKETS, INCLUDING MARKET

DISRUPTIONS AND SIGNIFICANT INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, WHICH MAY IMPEDE THE

COMPANY'S ACCESS TO, OR INCREASE THE COST OF, EXTERNAL FINANCING FOR ITS

OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS;

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES, BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY,

WHICH MAY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, AFFECT THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY'S PARKS

AND RESORTS OPERATIONS AND LEAD TO INCREASED EXPENSES IN SUCH AREAS AS

TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ACQUISITION AND MOTION PICTURE PRODUCTION AND

MARKETING;

LEGAL AND REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY AFFECT PARTICULAR BUSINESS UNITS,

SUCH AS REGULATORY ACTIONS AFFECTING ENVIRONMENTAL ACTIVITIES, CONSUMER

PRODUCTS, THEME PARK SAFETY, BROADCASTING OR INTERNET ACTIVITIES OR THE

PROTECTION OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY; THE IMPOSITION BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES OF

TRADE RESTRICTIONS OR MOTION PICTURE OR TELEVISION CONTENT REQUIREMENTS OR

QUOTAS, AND CHANGES IN INTERNATIONAL TAX LAWS OR CURRENCY CONTROLS;

-36-

ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR NATURAL DISASTERS, SUCH AS HURRICANES AND

EARTHQUAKES, WHICH MAY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPAIR PERFORMANCE AT THE

COMPANY'S PARKS AND RESORTS;

TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY AFFECT THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE COMPANY'S

CREATIVE PRODUCTS OR CREATE NEW RISKS TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PROTECT

ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY;

LABOR DISPUTES, WHICH MAY LEAD TO INCREASED COSTS OR DISRUPTION OF

OPERATIONS IN ANY OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS UNITS;

CHANGING PUBLIC AND CONSUMER TASTE, WHICH MAY AMONG OTHER THINGS, AFFECT THE

COMPANY'S ENTERTAINMENT, BROADCASTING AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS BUSINESSES

GENERALLY OR THE COMPANY'S PARKS AND RESORTS OPERATING SPECIFICALLY, OR

RESULT IN INCREASES IN BROADCASTING LOSSES OR LOSS OF ADVERTISING REVENUE;

AND

INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL AND MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY AFFECT AMONG

OTHER THINGS, TRAVEL AND LEISURE BUSINESSES GENERALLY OR THE COMPANY'S PARKS

AND RESORTS OPERATIONS SPECIFICALLY, OR RESULT IN INCREASES IN BROADCASTING

COSTS OR LOSS OF ADVERTISING REVENUE.

THIS LIST OF FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE PERFORMANCE AND THE ACCURACY OF

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS IS ILLUSTRATIVE, BUT BY NO MEANS EXHAUSTIVE.

ACCORDINGLY, ALL FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS SHOULD BE EVALUATED WITH THE

UNDERSTANDING OF THEIR INHERENT UNCERTAINTY.

ITEM 7A. MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS ESTABLISHED POLICIES

AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN

CURRENCIES AND THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN OF ITS INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND

EQUITY SECURITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE

IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER OVERALL

BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE

SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S

PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS FIXED RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE

OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE, WHICH IS SET BY

POLICY.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO

REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY IN ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS

ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO

PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES,

COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES

OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE SALE OF FOREIGN

CURRENCIES TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED, REVENUES. THE COMPANY

ALSO USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN

THE SAME PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES. THE PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EUROPEAN

EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY

MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES OF ITS

FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES FOR PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS. THE

GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE RELATED

EXPOSURES.

IN ADDITION, WE USE VARIOUS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MINIMIZE THE EXPOSURE

TO CHANGES IN FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY

SECURITIES.

-37-

IT IS THE COMPANY'S POLICY TO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE

TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED

NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER

INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

VALUE AT RISK

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A "VALUE-AT-RISK" (VAR) MODEL TO DETERMINE THE MAXIMUM

POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE

AND QUALIFYING EQUITY SENSITIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES

WERE MADE ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. VARIOUS

MODELING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED IN A VAR COMPUTATION. THE COMPANY'S

COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS

INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND EQUITY PRICES (A "VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE"

TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS WERE DETERMINED BY OBSERVING INTEREST

RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY AND EQUITY MARKET CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING QUARTER FOR

THE CALCULATION OF VAR AMOUNTS AT YEAR-END AND OVER EACH OF THE FOUR QUARTERS

FOR THE CALCULATION OF AVERAGE VAR AMOUNTS DURING THE YEAR. THE MODEL INCLUDES

ALL OF THE COMPANY'S DEBT AS WELL AS ALL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE

DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND QUALIFYING EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE VALUES OF FOREIGN

EXCHANGE OPTIONS DO NOT CHANGE ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS WITH THE UNDERLYING

CURRENCIES, AS EXCHANGE RATES VARY. THEREFORE, THE HEDGE COVERAGE ASSUMED TO BE

OBTAINED FROM EACH OPTION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT ITS RESPECTIVE

SENSITIVITY TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY VALUES. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM

COMMITMENTS AND RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES, WHICH CERTAIN OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE, WERE

EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT

ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WILL BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY, NOR DOES IT

CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS. SEE NOTE

12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REGARDING THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 AND 2000.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE, CALCULATED USING

THE VAR MODEL, IS AS FOLLOWS (UNAUDITED, IN MILLIONS).

THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AFTER ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY

ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS. IN DECEMBER 1999, DVD FINANCING, INC. (DFI), A

SUBSIDIARY OF DISNEY VACATION DEVELOPMENT, INC. AND AN INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF

THE COMPANY, COMPLETED A RECEIVABLE SALE TRANSACTION. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS

SALE, DFI PREPARES SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH ITS SEPARATE ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES ARE ALSO CONSOLIDATED IN THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2000, THE COMPANY ADOPTED TWO NEW ACCOUNTING

PRONOUNCEMENTS, AICPA STATEMENT OF POSITION NO. 00-2, ACCOUNTING BY PRODUCERS

OR DISTRIBUTORS OF FILMS (SOP 00-2) AND STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

(SFAS 133), SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED BY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

NO. 138 (SFAS 138).

SOP 00-2 ESTABLISHES NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR PRODUCERS AND DISTRIBUTORS

OF FILMS, WHICH RESULTED IN CHANGES IN REVENUE RECOGNITION AND ACCOUNTING FOR

EXPLOITATION COSTS, INCLUDING ADVERTISING AND MARKETING EXPENSES AND

DEVELOPMENT AND OVERHEAD COSTS. AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF SOP 00-2, THE

COMPANY RECORDED A ONE-TIME AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $228 MILLION, OR $0.11 PER

SHARE, REPRESENTING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION. THE CHARGE

REPRESENTS COSTS THAT WERE CAPITALIZED AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, THAT WOULD

HAVE BEEN EXPENSED UNDER THE NEW RULES. THE ADOPTION OF SOP 00-2 DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR'S OPERATING RESULTS.

SFAS 133 AND SFAS 138 REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY RECORD ALL DERIVATIVES ON THE

BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DERIVATIVES INTO WHICH THE

COMPANY ENTERS: HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AND HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE.

HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE

OF A RECOGNIZED ASSET OR LIABILITY, OR A FIRM COMMITMENT. HEDGES OF CASH FLOW

EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION OR THE

VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS TO BE PAID RELATED TO A RECOGNIZED LIABILITY. ON THE

DATE ON WHICH THE DERIVATIVE CONTRACT IS EXECUTED, THE

-52-

COMPANY DESIGNATES THE DERIVATIVE AS EITHER A FAIR VALUE HEDGE OR A CASH FLOW

HEDGE. CHANGES IN DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUES THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE

HEDGES ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS OFFSETS TO THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF

RELATED HEDGED ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FIRM COMMITMENTS. CHANGES IN THE

DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUES THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE DEFERRED AND

RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) UNTIL

THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS OCCUR AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE

PORTION OF A HEDGING DERIVATIVE'S CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE IS IMMEDIATELY

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. DERIVATIVES THAT ARE EXECUTED FOR RISK MANAGEMENT

PURPOSES BUT NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES UNDER SFAS 133 AND SFAS 138 ARE RECORDED

AT THEIR MARKET VALUE AND RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR

UNDERTAKING VARIOUS HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY LINKS ALL HEDGES THAT ARE

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES TO SPECIFIC ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ON THE

BALANCE SHEET OR TO SPECIFIC FIRM COMMITMENTS. THE COMPANY LINKS ALL HEDGES

THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES TO FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS OR TO

FLOATING-RATE LIABILITIES ON THE BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY ALSO ASSESSES, BOTH

AT THE INCEPTION OF THE HEDGE AND ON AN ON-GOING BASIS, WHETHER THE DERIVATIVES

THAT ARE USED IN HEDGING TRANSACTIONS ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE IN OFFSETTING

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OR CASH FLOWS OF HEDGED ITEMS. SHOULD IT BE DETERMINED

THAT A DERIVATIVE IS NOT HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AS A HEDGE, THE COMPANY WILL

DISCONTINUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING PROSPECTIVELY.

AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS 133 AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2000, AND IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS, THE COMPANY RECORDED A ONE-TIME AFTER-TAX

CHARGE OF $50 MILLION, OR $0.02 PER SHARE, IN ITS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

INCOME REPRESENTING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ADOPTION, AND AN AFTER-TAX

UNREALIZED GAIN OF $60 MILLION TO AOCI. AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO

EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS ARE NOT MATERIAL. THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED

A $16 MILLION AFTER-TAX GAIN FROM AOCI TO EARNINGS DURING FISCAL 2001, WHICH

WAS OFFSET BY NET LOSSES ON ITEMS BEING HEDGED. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 DID

NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR'S OPERATING RESULTS.

DURING THE YEAR, THE COMPANY RECORDED THE CHANGE IN VALUE RELATED TO CASH

FLOW HEDGES TO AOCI, WHICH WAS NOT MATERIAL. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY

RECLASSIFIED DEFERRED LOSSES RELATED TO CERTAIN CASH FLOW HEDGES FROM AOCI TO

EARNINGS, DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE TIMING OF THE ORIGINAL FORECASTED

TRANSACTION.

DURING THE YEAR, THE COMPANY RECORDED THE CHANGE IN FAIR MARKET VALUE

RELATED TO FAIR VALUE HEDGES AND THE INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO CASH FLOW

HEDGES TO EARNINGS. THESE AMOUNTS WERE NOT MATERIAL.

IN JULY 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 141, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (SFAS 141), AND

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS (SFAS 142). THEY ALSO ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 143, ACCOUNTING FOR OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS (SFAS 143), AND STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 144, ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS (SFAS 144), IN AUGUST AND OCTOBER 2001, RESPECTIVELY.

SFAS 141 REQUIRES ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001 BE

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD. SFAS 141 SUPERSEDES APB OPINION NO.

16, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, AND STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO.

38, ACCOUNTING FOR PREACQUISITION CONTINGENCIES OF PURCHASED ENTERPRISES, AND

IS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001.

SFAS 142 ADDRESSES THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR ACQUIRED

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. UNDER THE NEW RULES, THE COMPANY IS NO

LONGER REQUIRED TO AMORTIZE GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

INDEFINITE LIVES, BUT WILL BE SUBJECT TO PERIODIC TESTING FOR IMPAIRMENT.

-53-

SFAS 142 SUPERSEDES APB OPINION NO. 17, INTANGIBLE ASSETS. EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1,

2001, THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT SFAS 142 AND IS EVALUATING THE EFFECT THAT SUCH

ADOPTION MAY HAVE ON ITS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

POSITION. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF ITS

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WILL NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED.

SFAS 143 ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR THE RECOGNITION AND

MEASUREMENT OF AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION AND ITS ASSOCIATED ASSET

RETIREMENT COST. IT ALSO PROVIDES ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE FOR LEGAL OBLIGATIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS. SFAS 143 IS

EFFECTIVE IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2002, WITH EARLY ADOPTION

PERMITTED. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS 143 WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

POSITION UPON ADOPTION. THE COMPANY PLANS TO ADOPT SFAS 143 EFFECTIVE OCTOBER

1, 2002.

SFAS 144 ESTABLISHES A SINGLE ACCOUNTING MODEL FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR

DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. SFAS 144

SUPERSEDED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 121, ACCOUNTING FOR

THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF

(SFAS 121), AND APB OPINION NO. 30, REPORTING THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS--

REPORTING THE EFFECTS OF DISPOSAL OF A SEGMENT OF A BUSINESS, AND EXTRAORDINARY,

UNUSUAL AND INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING EVENTS AND TRANSACTIONS. THE PROVISIONS OF

SFAS 144 ARE EFFECTIVE IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER DECEMBER 15, 2001, WITH

EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED, AND IN GENERAL ARE TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY. THE

COMPANY PLANS TO ADOPT SFAS 144 EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2001 AND DOES NOT EXPECT

THAT THE ADOPTION WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

FOOTNOTES THERETO. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE ESTIMATES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUES FROM THE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION OF MOTION PICTURES ARE RECOGNIZED

WHEN MOTION PICTURES ARE EXHIBITED. REVENUES FROM VIDEO SALES ARE RECOGNIZED ON

THE DATE THAT VIDEO UNITS ARE MADE WIDELY AVAILABLE FOR SALE BY RETAILERS.

REVENUES FROM THE LICENSING OF FEATURE FILMS AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ARE

RECORDED WHEN THE MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE FOR TELECASTING BY THE LICENSEE AND

WHEN CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS ARE MET.

BROADCAST ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN COMMERCIALS ARE AIRED.

REVENUES FROM TELEVISION SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S PRIMARY

CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED.

INTERNET ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE BASIS OF IMPRESSION

VIEWS IN THE PERIOD THE ADVERTISING IS DISPLAYED, PROVIDED THAT NO SIGNIFICANT

OBLIGATIONS REMAIN AND COLLECTION OF THE RESULTING RECEIVABLE IS PROBABLE.

DIRECT MARKETING AND INTERNET-BASED MERCHANDISE REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED UPON

SHIPMENT TO CUSTOMERS.

MERCHANDISE LICENSING ADVANCE AND GUARANTEE PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE

UNDERLYING ROYALTIES ARE EARNED.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE

TICKETS ARE USED. REVENUES FROM PARTICIPANTS AT THE THEME PARKS ARE GENERALLY

RECORDED OVER THE PERIOD OF THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENTS COMMENCING WITH THE

OPENING OF THE RELATED ATTRACTION.

-54-

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH ON HAND AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES

WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS.

INVESTMENTS

DEBT SECURITIES THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE POSITIVE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD

TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS "HELD-TO-MATURITY" AND REPORTED AT AMORTIZED

COST. DEBT SECURITIES NOT CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND MARKETABLE EQUITY

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER "TRADING" OR "AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE," AND ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN EARNINGS OR

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY, RESPECTIVELY. ALL OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR USING EITHER THE COST METHOD OR THE EQUITY METHOD.

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A

DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW THE COST BASIS IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. IF THE

DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COST BASIS OF

THE SECURITY IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE WRITE-DOWN IS

INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

INVENTORIES

CARRYING AMOUNTS OF MERCHANDISE, MATERIALS AND SUPPLIES INVENTORIES ARE

GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A MOVING AVERAGE COST BASIS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER

OF COST OR MARKET.

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS THAT ARE PRODUCED FOR SALE TO THIRD PARTIES ARE

STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR FAIR VALUE.

PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR THE COMPANY'S TELEVISION AND CABLE NETWORKS ARE STATED AT

THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE.

TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS AND RELATED LIABILITIES ARE

RECORDED WHEN THE LICENSE PERIOD BEGINS AND THE PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE FOR USE.

FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND PARTICIPATION COSTS ARE EXPENSED BASED ON

THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIOD'S GROSS REVENUES TO ESTIMATED TOTAL GROSS

REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES ON AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION BASIS. TELEVISION NETWORK

AND STATION RIGHTS FOR THEATRICAL MOVIES AND OTHER LONG-FORM PROGRAMMING ARE

CHARGED TO EXPENSE PRIMARILY ON ACCELERATED BASES RELATED TO THE USAGE OF THE

PROGRAMS. TELEVISION NETWORK SERIES COSTS AND MULTI-YEAR SPORTS RIGHTS ARE

CHARGED TO EXPENSE BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIOD'S GROSS REVENUES TO

ESTIMATED TOTAL GROSS REVENUES FROM SUCH PROGRAMS.

ESTIMATES OF TOTAL GROSS REVENUES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO A VARIETY

OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE LEVEL OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF FILM AND TELEVISION

PRODUCTS, ADVERTISING RATES AND SUBSCRIBER FEES. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE ESTIMATES

ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND AMORTIZATION IS ADJUSTED, IF NECESSARY. SUCH

ADJUSTMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE

PERIODS. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND

RIGHTS IS REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY.

PARKS, RESORTS AND OTHER PROPERTY

PARKS, RESORTS AND OTHER PROPERTY ARE CARRIED AT COST. DEPRECIATION IS

COMPUTED ON THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD BASED UPON ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES RANGING

FROM THREE TO FIFTY YEARS.

-55-

INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM TWO TO FORTY

YEARS. THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY REVIEWS THE RECOVERABILITY OF THE CARRYING VALUE

OF THESE ASSETS USING THE METHODOLOGY PRESCRIBED IN SFAS 121. THE COMPANY ALSO

REVIEWS LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE RELATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT

WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF

SUCH ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. UPON SUCH AN OCCURRENCE, RECOVERABILITY OF

THESE ASSETS IS DETERMINED BY COMPARING THE FORECASTED UNDISCOUNTED NET CASH

FLOWS OF THE OPERATION TO WHICH THE ASSETS RELATE, TO THE CARRYING AMOUNT,

INCLUDING ASSOCIATED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, OF SUCH OPERATION. IF THE OPERATION IS

DETERMINED TO BE UNABLE TO RECOVER THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ITS ASSETS, THEN

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE WRITTEN DOWN FIRST, FOLLOWED BY THE OTHER LONG-LIVED

ASSETS OF THE OPERATION, TO FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BASED ON

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, APPRAISED VALUES OR MANAGEMENT'S ESTIMATES, DEPENDING

UPON THE NATURE OF THE ASSETS.

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST, FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES,

INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS; FORWARD, OPTION AND

SWAPTION CONTRACTS, AND INTEREST RATE CAPS.

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES AND ASSIGNS THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGES OF

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFIC ASSETS, OR SPECIFIC LIABILITIES. WHEN HEDGED

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE SOLD OR EXTINGUISHED OR THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS

BEING HEDGED ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE GAIN

OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED HEDGING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OPTION PREMIUMS AND UNREALIZED LOSSES ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED

DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER

THE AGREEMENTS ARE RECORDED IN THE BALANCE SHEET AS OTHER ASSETS. UNREALIZED

GAINS ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE AND OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM HEDGES

ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES THE DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST

RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS AS

INTEREST AND EXCHANGE RATES SHIFT AS ADJUSTMENTS TO NET INTEREST EXPENSE OVER

THE LIVES OF THE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE TERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE SWAP

AGREEMENTS, PRIOR TO THEIR ORIGINAL MATURITY, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO NET

INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS.

CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH

FLOWS UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED ASSETS,

LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (SEE NOTES 5 AND 12).

EARNINGS PER SHARE

THE COMPANY PRESENTS BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS)

AMOUNTS. BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE

NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EPS AMOUNTS ARE

BASED UPON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES

OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE

COMPUTATION IN PERIODS IN WHICH THEY HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT. THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BASIC AND DILUTED EPS, FOR THE COMPANY, IS SOLELY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO STOCK OPTIONS. THE COMPANY USES THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD TO

CALCULATE THE IMPACT OF OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS. STOCK OPTIONS FOR WHICH THE

EXERCISE PRICE EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OVER THE PERIOD HAVE AN

ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT ON EPS AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION.

-56-

FOR THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, 2000 AND 1999, OPTIONS FOR 81

MILLION, 20 MILLION AND 28 MILLION SHARES, RESPECTIVELY, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE

DILUTED EPS CALCULATION FOR DISNEY COMMON STOCK BECAUSE THEY WERE ANTI-DILUTIVE.

STOCK OPTIONS

THE COMPANY USES THE INTRINSIC-VALUE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES AND, ACCORDINGLY, DOES NOT RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION

EXPENSE FOR ITS STOCK-BASED AWARDS TO EMPLOYEES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF INCOME. SEE NOTE 9 FOR PRO FORMA INFORMATION ON THE IMPACT OF THE FAIR-VALUE

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK OPTIONS.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE 2000 AND 1999 FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS TO CONFORM TO THE 2001 PRESENTATION.

2 ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

ON MARCH 20, 2001, THE COMPANY CONVERTED ALL OF ITS OUTSTANDING INTERNET

GROUP COMMON STOCK INTO DISNEY COMMON STOCK, RESULTING IN THE ISSUANCE OF

APPROXIMATELY 8.6 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK. FOR THE YEAR ENDED

SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, AS-REPORTED EARNINGS ATTRIBUTED TO DISNEY COMMON STOCK

REFLECT APPROXIMATELY 72% OF INTERNET GROUP LOSSES FROM OCTOBER 1, 2000 THROUGH

JANUARY 28, 2001 (THE LAST DATE PRIOR TO THE ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE CONVERSION),

AND 100% THEREAFTER. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS CEASED THE OPERATIONS OF THE

GO.COM PORTAL BUSINESS, WHICH RESULTED IN RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

OF $878 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR (SEE NOTE 14).

IN NOVEMBER 1999, THE COMPANY SOLD FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS, WHICH IT HAD

ACQUIRED AS PART OF THE 1996 ACQUISITION OF ABC, INC., GENERATING A PRE-TAX

GAIN OF $243 MILLION.

THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS HAVE INCORPORATED

INFOSEEK'S ACTIVITY, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, FROM NOVEMBER 18, 1999, THE DATE

ON WHICH THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ACQUISITION OF INFOSEEK, AND THE ACTIVITY OF

FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS THROUGH THE DATE OF ITS DISPOSAL. THE UNAUDITED PRO

FORMA INFORMATION BELOW PRESENTS COMBINED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AS IF THE

DISPOSITION OF FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS, THE ACQUISITION OF INFOSEEK, THE

CONVERSION OF THE INTERNET GROUP COMMON STOCK INTO DISNEY COMMON STOCK, THE

CLOSURE OF THE GO.COM PORTAL BUSINESS AND THE ADOPTION OF THE NEW FILM

ACCOUNTING RULES (SEE NOTE 1) HAD OCCURRED AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2000,

EXCLUDING THE ONE-TIME IMPACTS OF THOSE EVENTS. THE PRO FORMA AMOUNTS BELOW FOR

THE PRIOR YEAR EXCLUDE CHARGES FOR PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF $23 MILLION RELATED TO THE INFOSEEK ACQUISITION. THE

UNAUDITED PRO FORMA INFORMATION IS NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS HAD THESE EVENTS ACTUALLY OCCURRED AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2000,

NOR IS IT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE RESULTS.

THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF FAIRCHILD PUBLICATIONS IS REPORTED IN THE LINE "GAIN

ON SALE OF BUSINESSES" IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. ALSO REPORTED

IN THIS LINE ITEM ARE PRE-TAX GAINS ON THE SALES OF STARWAVE CORPORATION IN

FISCAL 1999 ($345 MILLION), EUROSPORT AND ULTRASEEK CORPORATION IN FISCAL 2000

($93 MILLION AND $153 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY) AND INFOSEEK JAPAN K.K. IN THE

CURRENT YEAR ($22 MILLION).

3 INVESTMENT IN EURO DISNEY

EURO DISNEY OPERATES THE DISNEYLAND PARIS THEME PARK AND RESORT COMPLEX ON A

4,800-ACRE SITE NEAR PARIS, FRANCE. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS 39% OWNERSHIP

INTEREST IN EURO DISNEY USING THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. AS OF SEPTEMBER

30, 2001, THE COMPANY'S RECORDED INVESTMENT IN EURO DISNEY, INCLUDING ACCOUNTS

AND NOTES RECEIVABLE, WAS $344 MILLION.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF EURO DISNEY IN 1994, EURO

DISNEY ASSOCIES S.N.C. (DISNEY SNC), A WHOLLY-OWNED AFFILIATE OF THE COMPANY,

ENTERED INTO A LEASE ARRANGEMENT WITH A NONCANCELABLE TERM OF 12 YEARS RELATED

TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DISNEYLAND PARIS THEME PARK ASSETS, AND THEN

ENTERED INTO A 12-YEAR SUBLEASE AGREEMENT WITH EURO DISNEY. REMAINING LEASE

RENTALS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 OF APPROXIMATELY $801 MILLION RECEIVABLE FROM

EURO DISNEY UNDER THE SUBLEASE APPROXIMATE THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE BY DISNEY SNC

UNDER THE LEASE. AT THE CONCLUSION OF THE SUBLEASE TERM, EURO DISNEY WILL HAVE

THE OPTION TO ASSUME DISNEY SNC'S RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE LEASE. IF

EURO DISNEY DOES NOT EXERCISE ITS OPTION, DISNEY SNC MAY PURCHASE THE ASSETS,

CONTINUE TO LEASE THE ASSETS OR ELECT TO TERMINATE THE LEASE, IN WHICH CASE

DISNEY SNC WOULD MAKE A TERMINATION PAYMENT TO THE LESSOR EQUAL TO 75% OF THE

LESSOR'S THEN OUTSTANDING DEBT RELATED TO THE THEME PARK ASSETS, ESTIMATED TO

BE $1.1 BILLION; DISNEY SNC COULD THEN SELL OR LEASE THE ASSETS ON BEHALF OF

THE LESSOR TO SATISFY THE REMAINING DEBT, WITH ANY EXCESS PROCEEDS PAYABLE TO

DISNEY SNC.

ALSO, AS PART OF THE RESTRUCTURING, THE COMPANY AGREED TO ARRANGE FOR THE

PROVISION OF A 10-YEAR UNSECURED STANDBY CREDIT FACILITY OF APPROXIMATELY $152

MILLION, UPON REQUEST, BEARING INTEREST AT THE PARIS INTERBANK OFFERED RATE

(PIBOR). AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, THERE WERE NO AMOUNTS OUTSTANDING UNDER THIS

FACILITY. HOWEVER, IT IS EXPECTED THAT EURO DISNEY WILL DRAW ON THIS LINE OF

CREDIT DURING FISCAL 2002. THE COMPANY ALSO AGREED, AS LONG AS ANY OF THE

RESTRUCTURED DEBT IS OUTSTANDING, TO MAINTAIN OWNERSHIP OF AT LEAST 25% OF THE

OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK OF EURO DISNEY THROUGH JUNE 2004 AND AT LEAST 16.67%

FOR AN ADDITIONAL TERM THEREAFTER.

AFTER A FIVE-YEAR WAIVER RESULTING FROM THE RESTRUCTURING, ROYALTIES AND

MANAGEMENT FEES FROM EURO DISNEY WERE PARTIALLY REINSTATED BEGINNING FISCAL

YEAR 1999. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY EARNED APPROXIMATELY $28 MILLION, $30

MILLION AND $33 MILLION IN ROYALTIES AND MANAGEMENT FEES IN FISCAL YEAR 2001,

2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. ROYALTIES ARE TO BE FULLY REINSTATED BEGINNING IN

FISCAL YEAR 2004, WITH MANAGEMENT FEES PROGRESSIVELY REINSTATED THROUGH FISCAL

YEAR 2018.

IN NOVEMBER 1999, EURO DISNEY STOCKHOLDERS APPROVED AN INCREASE IN SHARE

CAPITAL THROUGH AN EQUITY RIGHTS OFFERING. THE OFFERING RAISED $238 MILLION.

THE NET PROCEEDS WERE USED TO PARTIALLY FINANCE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SECOND

THEME PARK, THE WALT DISNEY STUDIOS, ADJACENT TO THE DISNEYLAND PARIS THEME

PARK. THE COMPANY SUBSCRIBED TO APPROXIMATELY $91 MILLION OF THE EQUITY RIGHTS

OFFERING, MAINTAINING ITS 39% INTEREST IN EURO DISNEY. THE WALT DISNEY STUDIOS

IS EXPECTED TO OPEN IN MARCH 2002.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 AND 2000 WERE REDUCED BY A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATING TO A PORTION OF THE TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO

CERTAIN NET OPERATING LOSSES (NOLS) REFLECTED ON STATE TAX RETURNS OF INFOSEEK

AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES FOR PERIODS PRIOR TO THE INFOSEEK ACQUISITION ON NOVEMBER

18, 1999 (SEE NOTE 2), WHERE APPLICABLE STATE TAX LAWS LIMIT THE UTILIZATION OF

SUCH NOLS. SINCE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO ACQUIRED DEFERRED TAX

ASSETS, THE SUBSEQUENT REALIZATION OF THESE TAX BENEFITS WOULD RESULT IN THE

APPLICATION OF THE ALLOWANCE AMOUNT AS A REDUCTION TO GOODWILL.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, APPROXIMATELY $191 MILLION OF FOREIGN TAX CREDIT

CARRYFORWARDS WAS AVAILABLE AS CREDITS AGAINST FUTURE INCOME TAXES. FOREIGN TAX

CREDIT CARRYFORWARDS WILL EXPIRE BETWEEN THE YEARS 2003 AND 2006.

IN 2001, 2000 AND 1999, INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTION TRANSACTIONS OF $48 MILLION, $197 MILLION AND $96 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, THE COMPANY ALSO HELD $756 MILLION

AND $796 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF NON-PUBLIC COST METHOD INVESTMENTS. REALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES ARE DETERMINED PRINCIPALLY ON AN AVERAGE COST BASIS. IN 2001,

2000 AND 1999, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $87 MILLION, $41 MILLION AND $70 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, IN NET GAINS ON SALES OF SECURITIES.

IN ADDITION, IN 2001 AND 2000, THE COMPANY RECORDED NON-CASH CHARGES OF $241

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES. THE COMPANY'S

OBJECTIVE IS TO MANAGE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH

FLOWS AND ON THE MARKET VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS. THE COMPANY

MAINTAINS FIXED RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND

MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE, WHICH IS SET BY POLICY.

SIGNIFICANT INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE COMPANY

DURING 2001 AND 2000 INCLUDED PAY-FLOATING AND PAY-FIXED SWAPS. PAY-FLOATING

SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS TO LIBOR RATE

INDEXED VARIABLE RATE INSTRUMENTS. THESE SWAP AGREEMENTS EXPIRE IN ONE TO 20

YEARS. PAY-FIXED SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS TO FIXED

RATE INSTRUMENTS. THE PAY-FIXED SWAPS EXPIRE IN ONE TO THREE YEARS. IN ADDITION

TO THE $700 MILLION OF PAY-FIXED SWAPS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 5, AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2001, THE COMPANY HELD $500 MILLION OF PAY-FIXED SWAPS THAT WERE DE-DESIGNATED

AS HEDGES. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2000, THE COMPANY HELD $186 MILLION OF

PAY-FLOATING SWAPS AND $786 MILLION OF PAY-FIXED SWAPS THAT WERE DE-DESIGNATED

AS HEDGES. THE CHANGE IN MARKET VALUES RELATED TO THESE SWAPS FROM THE TIME

THEY WERE DE-DESIGNATED AS HEDGES, HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS.

THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ON INCOME IN 2001,

2000 AND 1999 WAS NOT MATERIAL. THE AMOUNT OF DEFERRED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT TRANSACTIONS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 WAS NOT

MATERIAL.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY TRANSACTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THE COMPANY'S OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE

EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW VOLATILITY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES

TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES.

BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM

PERCENTAGES OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES FOR PERIODS NOT TO

EXCEED FIVE YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN

THE VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES.

IT IS THE COMPANY'S POLICY TO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS ONLY

TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE

PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES.

THE COMPANY USES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE

SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES TO HEDGE FORECASTED REVENUES. THE COMPANY ALSO USES

FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. WHILE THESE

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN VALUE, SUCH FLUCTUATIONS ARE

OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED. THE

PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EUROPEAN EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN

AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO HEDGE FOREIGN

CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BORROWINGS.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON CONTRACTS HEDGING FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES

ARE RECORDED TO AOCI, AND RECLASSIFIED TO CURRENT EARNINGS WHEN SUCH REVENUES

ARE RECOGNIZED, AND OFFSET CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY

REVENUES. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 AND 2000, THE COMPANY HAD DEFERRED GAINS OF $91

MILLION AND $24 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND DEFERRED LOSSES OF $24 MILLION AND

$7 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE TRANSACTIONS.

DEFERRED AMOUNTS TO BE RECOGNIZED CAN CHANGE WITH MARKET CONDITIONS AND WILL BE

SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE RELATED HEDGED

TRANSACTIONS. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ON

OPERATING INCOME IN 2001 AND IN 2000 WAS A NET GAIN OF $142 MILLION AND $195

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 AND 2000, THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENTS, RECEIVABLES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, BORROWINGS

AND INTEREST RATE, FORWARD AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS.

AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 AND 2000, THE FAIR VALUES OF CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE APPROXIMATED CARRYING VALUES

BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR

DETERMINED BASED ON BROKER QUOTES OR QUOTED MARKET PRICES OR RATES FOR THE SAME

OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS, AND THE RELATED CARRYING AMOUNTS ARE AS FOLLOWS (IN

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS WITH, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY

OF, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE COUNTERPARTIES TO ITS FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS, AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTIES. THE

COMPANY WOULD NOT REALIZE A MATERIAL LOSS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 IN THE EVENT

OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY ONE COUNTERPARTY. THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS

ONLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF A-

OR BETTER. THE COMPANY'S CURRENT POLICY REGARDING AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL

INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES IS GENERALLY TO REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT

CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A- OR IN THE EVENT AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED LIMITS

AS DEFINED BY CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF

INVESTMENT CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANY'S TRADE RECEIVABLES AND INVESTMENTS DO NOT REPRESENT A

SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2001 DUE TO THE WIDE

VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS INTO WHICH THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS ARE SOLD,

THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS MANY GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE

COMPANY'S PORTFOLIO AMONG INSTRUMENTS AND ISSUERS.

13 COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN

GUARANTEES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY FOR THE PURCHASE OF BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR

VARIOUS FEATURE FILMS, SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING AGGREGATING APPROXIMATELY

$13.4 BILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $10.1 BILLION

RELATED TO SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, PRIMARILY NFL, COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND MLB.

THIS AMOUNT IS SUBSTANTIALLY PAYABLE OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS REAL ESTATE OPERATING LEASES, INCLUDING RETAIL

OUTLETS AND DISTRIBUTION CENTERS FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND OFFICE SPACE FOR

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE PURPOSES. FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER THESE

NON-CANCELABLE OPERATING LEASES TOTALED $1.8 BILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2001,

PAYABLE AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).

INCLUDING COMMON-AREA MAINTENANCE AND CONTINGENT RENTALS, WAS $420 MILLION,

$482 MILLION AND $385 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES, CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND

OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR CO-DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS LEGAL ACTIONS INVOLVING

COPYRIGHT, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE CONDUCT

OF ITS BUSINESSES.

ALL PRO SPORTS CAMPS, INC., NICHOLAS STRACICK AND EDWARD RUSSELL V. WALT

DISNEY COMPANY, WALT DISNEY WORLD CO., DISNEY DEVELOPMENT COMPANY AND STEVEN B.

WILSON. ON JANUARY 8, 1997, THE PLAINTIFF ENTITY AND TWO OF ITS PRINCIPALS OR

FORMER PRINCIPALS FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY, TWO OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES

AND A FORMER EMPLOYEE IN THE CIRCUIT COURT FOR ORANGE COUNTY, FLORIDA. THE

PLAINTIFFS ASSERTED THAT THE DEFENDANTS HAD MISAPPROPRIATED FROM THEM THE

CONCEPT USED FOR THE DISNEY'S WIDE WORLD OF SPORTS COMPLEX AT THE WALT DISNEY

WORLD RESORT. ON AUGUST 11, 2000, A JURY RETURNED A VERDICT AGAINST THE COMPANY

AND ITS TWO SUBSIDIARIES IN THE AMOUNT OF $240 MILLION. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE COURT

AWARDED PLAINTIFFS AN ADDITIONAL $100.00 IN EXEMPLARY DAMAGES BASED ON

PARTICULAR FINDINGS BY THE JURY. THE COMPANY HAS FILED AN APPEAL FROM THE

JUDGMENT AND BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL GROUNDS FOR COMPLETE REVERSAL

OR REDUCTION OF THE VERDICT.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE

IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE ON THE

COMPANY'S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.

IN 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TOTALING

$1.45 BILLION. THE GO.COM CHARGE IS FOR THE CLOSURE OF THE GO.COM PORTAL

BUSINESS AND INCLUDES A NON-CASH WRITE-OFF OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS TOTALING $820

MILLION (SEE NOTE 2). THE INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS FOR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN INTERNET

INVESTMENTS. THE WORKFORCE REDUCTION CHARGES ARE PRIMARILY FOR SEVERANCE COSTS

AT THE DISNEY STORE AND DISNEY CATALOG. THESE ASSETS WERE EVALUATED FOR

IMPAIRMENT UNDER A HELD FOR USE MODEL DUE TO DECLINING CASH FLOWS. FAIR VALUE

WAS GENERALLY DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2001, THE COMPANY INITIATED A PLAN TO

ELIMINATE 4,000 FULL-TIME JOBS THROUGH A COMBINATION OF VOLUNTARY AND

INVOLUNTARY REDUCTIONS. THE REDUCTION AFFECTED EMPLOYEES IN ALL BUSINESS UNITS

AND GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS. THE $111 MILLION OF COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE WORKFORCE

ITS WORKFORCE REDUCTION AND PAID TERMINATION BENEFITS TOTALING $92 MILLION.

AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, APPROXIMATELY $118 MILLION OF THE RESTRUCTURING

AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REMAINED AS AN ACCRUED LIABILITY ON THE BALANCE SHEET,

PAID IN FISCAL 2002.

IN 2000, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AMOUNTED TO $92 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

WRITE-DOWNS OF CERTAIN INTERNET INVESTMENTS AND AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT WRITE-DOWN

AT TOYSMART.COM IN CONNECTION WITH ITS CLOSURE.

IN 1999, THE COMPANY RECORDED RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES TOTALING

$172 MILLION. THE CHARGES INCLUDED $132 MILLION FOR SEVERANCE AND OTHER CHARGES

AND $40 MILLION FOR LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS. THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

RELATED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF OPERATIONS IN THE COMPANY'S BROADCASTING,

TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND REGIONAL ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES AS WELL AS NON-CASH

CHARGES FOR WRITE-DOWNS OF UNDERUTILIZED ASSETS.

15 SUBSEQUENT EVENT

ON OCTOBER 24, 2001, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED 100% OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMON

STOCK OF FOX FAMILY WORLDWIDE, INC. ("FFW") FOR $5.2 BILLION, INCLUDING $2.9

BILLION IN CASH, PLUS THE ASSUMPTION OF $2.3 BILLION IN DEBT AND PREFERRED

STOCK. UPON THE CLOSING OF THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY CHANGED FFW'S NAME TO

ABC FAMILY WORLDWIDE, INC. AMONG THE BUSINESSES ACQUIRED WAS THE FOX FAMILY

CHANNEL, WHICH HAS BEEN CHANGED TO THE ABC FAMILY CHANNEL, A PROGRAMMING

SERVICE THAT CURRENTLY REACHES APPROXIMATELY 81 MILLION CABLE AND SATELLITE

TELEVISION SUBSCRIBERS THROUGHOUT THE U.S.; A 76% INTEREST IN FOX KIDS EUROPE,

A DUTCH PUBLIC SUBSIDIARY THAT REACHES MORE THAN 24 MILLION SUBSCRIBERS ACROSS

ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTION BUSINESSES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, THE FOX

KID'S NETWORK, A BLOCK OF CHILDREN'S PROGRAMMING BROADCASTED PRIMARILY BY

FOX-AFFILIATED TV STATIONS, AND ONGOING RIGHTS TO USE THE "FOX" NAME (OTHER

ALSO IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED PROGRAMMING

COMMITMENTS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY $675

MILLION FOR CERTAIN MLB GAMES THROUGH 2006.

-75-

THE COMPANY'S MOTIVATION FOR THE ACQUISITION WAS TO INCREASE SHAREHOLDER

VALUE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT CAN REACH THIS OBJECTIVE BY IMPROVING THE

PROGRAMMING OF ACQUIRED CABLE CHANNELS THROUGH THE USE OF NEW STRATEGIES,

INCLUDING REPURPOSING THE PROGRAMMING OF THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, AND BY

REDUCING OPERATING COSTS THROUGH CONSOLIDATION.

THE ACQUISITION OF FFW IS BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS A PURCHASE, IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS 141. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF IDENTIFYING AND VALUING THE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF FFW BY REPORTING UNIT. THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE

PRICE HAS NOT YET BEEN COMPLETED.
