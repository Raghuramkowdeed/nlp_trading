consolidated financial information -- the walt disney company
part i
item 1. business
the walt disney company, together with its subsidiaries, is a diversified
worldwide entertainment company with operations in four business segments:
media networks, parks & resorts, studio entertainment and consumer products.
the terms "company" and "we" are used to refer collectively to the parent
company and the subsidiaries through which our various businesses are actually
conducted.
during the year the company converted all of its outstanding internet group
common stock into disney common stock and changed the reporting structure of
the various components of the internet group. accordingly, the company no
longer reports separate results for the internet group.
information on revenues, operating income, identifiable assets and
supplemental revenue of the company's business segments appears in note 11 to
the consolidated financial statements included in item 8 hereof. the company
employed approximately 114,000 people as of september 30, 2001.
media networks
television and radio networks
the company operates the abc television network, which as of september 30,
2001 had 226 primary affiliated stations operating under long-term agreements
reaching 99.9% of all u.s. television households. the abc television network
broadcasts programs in "dayparts" as follows: monday through friday early
morning, daytime and late night, monday through sunday prime time, news,
children's and sports. we operate the abc radio networks, which reach more than
126 million domestic listeners weekly and consist of more than 8,900 program
affiliations on more than 4,600 radio stations. the abc radio networks also
produce and distribute radio program series for radio stations nationwide and
can be heard in more than 100 countries worldwide. in addition, the abc radio
networks produce and operate radio disney, which is intended to appeal to
children ages 6 to 11 and their parents. radio disney is carried on 48 stations
that cover more than 54 percent of the u.s. market.
generally, the television and radio networks pay the cost of producing their
own programs or acquiring broadcast rights from other producers for network
programming and pay varying amounts of compensation to affiliated stations for
broadcasting the programs and commercial announcements included therein.
network operations derive substantially all of their revenues from the sale to
advertisers of time in network programs for commercial announcements. the
ability to sell time for commercial announcements and the rates received are
primarily dependent on the size and nature of the audience that the network can
deliver to the advertiser as well as overall advertiser demand for time on
network broadcasts.
television and radio stations
we own nine very high frequency (vhf) television stations, five of which are
located in the top ten markets in the united states; one ultra high frequency
(uhf) television station; 36 standard am radio stations; and 17 fm radio
stations. all of the television stations are affiliated with the abc television
network, and most of the 53 radio stations are affiliated with the abc radio
networks. our television stations reach 24% of the nation's television
households, calculated using the multiple ownership rules of the federal
communications commission (fcc). our radio stations reach 15 million people
weekly in the top 20 united states advertising markets. markets, frequencies
and other station details are set forth in the following tables:

competition
the abc television network, disney channel, espn and our other broadcasting
services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks,
independent television stations, other video media such as cable television,
satellite television program services, videocassettes and dvds. in the sale of
advertising time, the broadcasting operations compete with other television
networks, independent television stations, suppliers of cable television
programs and other advertising media such as newspapers, magazines and
billboards. the abc radio networks likewise compete with other radio networks
and radio programming services, independent radio stations and other
advertising media.
the company's television and radio stations are in competition with other
television and radio stations, cable television systems, satellite television
program services, videocassettes, dvds and other advertising media such as
newspapers, magazines and billboards. competition occurs primarily in
individual market areas. a television station in one market does not compete
directly with other stations in other market areas.
the growth in the cable industry's share of viewers has resulted in
increased competitive pressures for advertising revenues. in addition, sports
and other programming costs have increased due to increased competition. the
company's cable networks, including the recently acquired fox family worldwide,
also face competition for carriage by the cable service providers. there is no
guarantee that the company will be successful in contract renegotiations when
contracts come up for renewal.
federal regulation
television and radio broadcasting are subject to the jurisdiction of the fcc
under the communications act of 1934, as amended. the communications act
empowers the fcc, among other things, to issue, revoke or modify broadcasting
licenses, determine the location of stations, regulate the equipment used by
stations, adopt regulations necessary to carry out the provisions of the
communications act and impose penalties for violation of its regulations. fcc
regulations also restrict the ownership of stations and cable operations in
certain circumstances, and regulate the practices of network broadcasters,
cable providers and competing services.
fcc laws and regulations are subject to change, and the company generally
cannot predict whether new legislation or regulations, or a change in the
extent of application or enforcement of current laws and regulations, would
have an adverse impact on our operations.
parks & resorts
the company operates the walt disney world resort and disney cruise line in
florida, the disneyland resort in california, espn zone facilities in several
states and anaheim sports in california. the company also licenses the
operations of the tokyo disneyland resort in japan, and licenses and manages
the disneyland resort paris in france.
walt disney world resort
the walt disney world resort is located on approximately 30,500 acres of
land owned by company subsidiaries 15 miles southwest of orlando, florida. the
resort includes four theme parks
-6-
(the magic kingdom, epcot, disney-mgm studios and disney's animal kingdom);
hotels and villas; a retail, dining and entertainment complex; a sports
complex; conference centers; campgrounds; golf courses; water parks and other
recreational facilities designed to attract visitors for an extended stay.

competition
all of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on
a year-round basis. historically, the theme parks and resort business
experience fluctuations in park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from
the nature of vacation travel. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally
occur during the summer months when school vacations occur and during
early-winter and spring holiday periods.
the company's theme parks and resorts compete with all other forms of
entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. the profitability
of the leisure-time industry is influenced by various factors that are not
directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and
exchange rate fluctuations, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure
time, oil and transportation prices and weather patterns. during fiscal 2001,
the company's theme park and resort operations were also adversely affected by

competition
the success of the studio entertainment operations is heavily dependent upon
public taste, which is unpredictable and subject to change. in addition, studio
entertainment operating results fluctuate due to the timing and performance of
theatrical and home video releases. release dates are determined by several
factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.
the studio entertainment businesses compete with all forms of entertainment.
a significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and
television films, exploit products in the home video market, provide pay
television programming services and sponsor live theater. we also compete to
obtain creative talents, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast rights

should be deemed a termination "for cause" and any severance payments to him
forfeited. on october 8, 1998, the delaware court of chancery dismissed all
counts of the amended complaint. plaintiffs appealed, and on february 9, 2000,
the supreme court of delaware affirmed the dismissal but ruled also that
-16-
plaintiffs should be permitted to file an amended complaint in accordance with
the court's opinion. subsequently, plaintiffs have taken preparatory steps
toward such a filing.
similar or identical claims have also been filed by the same plaintiffs
(other than william and geraldine brehm) in the superior court of the state of
california, los angeles county, beginning with a claim filed by richard and
david kaplan on january 3, 1997. on may 18, 1998, an additional claim was filed
in the same california court by dorothy l. greenfield, who, on september 25,
2001, sought leave to amend her claim to allege that the company's 2000
employment agreements with michael d. eisner and robert a. iger are excessive,
and that the company's directors as of january and june 2000 breached their
duties to the company by approving the agreements. all of the california claims
have been consolidated and stayed pending final resolution of the delaware
proceedings.
all pro sports camps, inc., nicholas stracick and edward russell v. walt
disney company, walt disney world co., disney development company and steven b.
wilson. on january 8, 1997, the plaintiff entity and two of its principals or
former principals filed a lawsuit against the company, two of its subsidiaries
and a former employee in the circuit court for orange county, florida. the
plaintiffs asserted that the defendants had misappropriated from them the
concept used for the disney's wide world of sports complex at the walt disney
world resort. on august 11, 2000, a jury returned a verdict against the company
and its two subsidiaries in the amount of $240 million. subsequently, the court
awarded plaintiffs an additional $100.00 in exemplary damages based on
particular findings by the jury. the company has filed an appeal from the
judgment and believes that there are substantial grounds for complete reversal
or reduction of the verdict.
management believes that it is not currently possible to estimate the
impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have on the
company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.

(1) including disney's retained interest in the internet group. disney's
as-reported retained interest in the internet group reflects 100% of
internet group losses through november 17, 1999, approximately 72% for the
period from november 18, 1999 through january 28, 2001 (the last date prior
to the announcement of the conversion of the internet group common stock)
and 100% thereafter.
-21-
consolidated results
2001 vs. 2000
as-reported net loss was $158 million compared to net income of $920 million
in the prior year. net loss and loss per share attributed to disney common
stock were $41 million and $0.02, respectively, compared to net income and
earnings per share attributed to disney common stock of $1.2 billion and $0.57,
respectively, in the prior year. the current year as-reported net loss includes
charges from the cumulative effect of accounting changes ($278 million or $0.13
per disney share) and restructuring and impairment charges ($1.45 billion or
$0.52 per disney share). as-reported results also include pre-tax gains on the
sale of infoseek japan k.k. ($22 million) in 2001, and fairchild publications
($243 million), ultraseek corporation ($153 million) and eurosport ($93
million) in 2000. excluding the charges and gains mentioned above, earnings per
share attributed to disney common stock was $0.63 and $0.56 for the current and
prior year, respectively. results for the year also reflected lower
amortization of intangible assets and net interest expense and other and higher
equity in the income of investees, partially offset by decreased segment
operating income and higher corporate and unallocated shared expenses. lower
amortization of intangible assets reflected the write-off of intangible assets
associated with the closure of the go.com portal business in the second quarter
of the current year, certain intangible assets becoming fully amortized in the
first quarter and a reduction in intangible assets related to the sale of
fairchild publications, ultraseek and eurosport in fiscal 2000. decreases in
net interest expense and other were driven by gains on the sale of certain
investments, lower interest rates and lower average debt balances throughout
most of the year. higher equity in the income of investees reflected improved
results from cable equity investments including lifetime television, the
history channel and a&e; television and certain international cable equity
investments, partially offset by start-up losses incurred in connection with
new investments. decreased segment operating income reflected lower media
networks and parks & resorts results, partially offset by improvements at
studio entertainment and consumer products. increased corporate and unallocated
shared expenses were driven by costs associated with several strategic
initiatives designed to improve overall company-wide efficiency and promote the
disney brand.
on october 24, 2001, the company acquired fox family worldwide, inc. ("ffw")
for $5.2 billion, including $2.9 billion in cash, plus the assumption of $2.3
billion in debt (see note 15 to the consolidated financial statements).
the company anticipates that the income statement for 2002 will include the
impact of ffw merger-related and integration expenses; amortization of
intangible assets, to the extent identified, valued and deemed to have
determinable lives as part of the purchase price allocation; increased interest
expense from the financing of the acquisition and increased revenues and
expenses from the acquired operations.
the balance sheet impact of the acquisition is expected to reflect ffw's
historical carrying amounts, excluding the fox kid's network, modified by
purchase accounting adjustments to reflect the difference between ffw's
historical carrying amounts and fair value; significant additional intangible
assets, including goodwill; additional assets and liabilities that reflect the
fair value of contingencies, executory contracts and other commitments, and
increased debt from funding for the purchase.
2000 vs. 1999
as-reported earnings and earnings per share attributed to disney common
stock, decreased 8% to $1.2 billion and $0.57, respectively, driven by higher
amortization of intangible assets and income taxes, partially offset by
increased segment operating income and equity in the income of investees and
lower net interest expense and other. increased amortization of intangible
assets resulted from
-22-
intangible assets associated with the acquisition of infoseek corporation
(infoseek). higher segment operating income was driven by growth at media
networks and parks & resorts, partially offset by decreases in the other
segments. equity in the income of investees increased due to higher infoseek
equity losses in fiscal 1999 as well as improved results from the company's
cable equity investments. net interest expense and other decreased due to lower
average debt balances, partially offset by higher interest rates in fiscal
2000. lower average debt balances reflected increased cash flow.
fiscal 2000 includes lower restructuring and impairment charges, discussed
more fully below, and higher gain on the sale of businesses. the increase in
the gain on sale of businesses reflects gains on the sale of fairchild,
ultraseek and eurosport totaling $243 million, $153 million and $93 million,
respectively, in fiscal 2000 as compared to the gain on the sale of starwave
totaling $345 million in fiscal 1999. as-reported net income including
restructuring and impairment charges and gain on the sale of business was $920
million, including a loss of $276 million attributed to the internet group.
as-reported earnings attributed to disney common stock were $1.2 billion or
$0.57 per share in fiscal 2000 versus $1.3 billion or $0.62 per share in fiscal
1999.

total restructuring and impairment charges      $1,454     $92    $172
======    ===     ====
in 2001, the company recorded restructuring and impairment charges totaling
$1.45 billion. the go.com charge is for the closure of the go.com portal
business and includes a non-cash write-off of intangible assets totaling $820
million (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). the investment
impairment charge is for other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of
certain internet investments. the workforce reduction charges are primarily for
severance costs and are discussed more fully below. the disneyquest and disney
store closure charges are for the closure of the chicago disneyquest facility
and approximately 100 disney stores and includes the write-down of fixed assets
and leasehold improvements, leasehold termination costs, severance and other
related closure costs. the asset impairment charge is for certain long-lived
assets, primarily at the disney store and disney catalog. these assets were
evaluated for impairment under a held for use model due to declining cash
flows. fair value was generally determined based on discounted cash flows.
during the third quarter of fiscal 2001, the company initiated a plan to
eliminate 4,000 full-time jobs through a combination of voluntary and
involuntary reductions. the reduction affected
-23-
employees in all business units and geographic regions. the $111 million of
costs associated with the workforce reduction consist primarily of severance
costs and write-offs of idled facilities. as of september 30, 2001, the company
had substantially completed its workforce reduction and paid termination
benefits totaling $92 million.
as of september 30, 2001, approximately $118 million of the restructuring
and impairment charges remained as an accrued liability on the balance sheet,
of which $19 million related to the workforce reduction and $21 million is from
prior-year restructuring charges. the majority of this amount is expected to be
paid in fiscal 2002.
in 2000, impairment charges amounted to $92 million, primarily related to
write-downs of certain internet investments and an asset impairment write-down
at toysmart.com in connection with its closure.
in 1999, the company recorded restructuring and impairment charges totaling
$172 million. the charges included $132 million for severance and other charges
and $40 million related to long-lived asset impairments. the restructuring
charges included severance and lease and other contract cancellation costs,
primarily related to the consolidation of operations in the company's
broadcasting, television production and regional entertainment businesses as
well as non-cash charges for write-downs of underutilized assets.
fiscal 2002 outlook
the company expects that the events of september 11th and their aftermath
coupled with the already soft economy will continue to influence its operating
results into fiscal 2002. this impact is likely to be most significant in
certain of the media networks operations and parks & resorts. the media
networks advertising-supported businesses, such as the television and radio
network and stations, are expected to have declines in revenues due to the soft
advertising marketplace, continued ratings decreases and a potential increase
in news preemptions and higher news production costs. in cable, the slow
economy and a surplus of inventory are resulting in downward pressure on
advertising rates. parks & resorts operations are likely to be affected by the
downturn in leisure travel and lower consumer confidence especially as compared
to the record setting first quarter the segment achieved in the prior year. to
date, walt disney world attendance is down roughly 25% versus the first quarter
of last year. we expect hotel occupancy to be down by approximately 20 and 15
percentage points for walt disney world and disneyland, respectively, compared
to the first quarter of last year. additionally, the company expects that soft
retail sales and weak consumer confidence are likely to affect its consumer
products business.
as such, the company believes that its operating income in the first quarter
of fiscal 2002 could be somewhat less than half that of the strong first
quarter results of the prior year. the company expects that the first quarter
will represent the most difficult year-over-year comparison. while the future
is uncertain, the company should experience an improved business climate in the
last three fiscal quarters of 2002, with operating income declines of as much
as 10 to 15 percent for those later three periods combined versus the prior
year.
the company is taking a variety of measures to mitigate these impacts,
including a planned reduction of fiscal 2002 capital expenditures. in the parks
& resorts businesses, mitigation efforts include reducing man-hours, closing
non-essential food and beverage locations, instituting a hiring freeze and
delaying non-essential refurbishments. in media networks, all businesses are
undertaking aggressive cost reduction initiatives.

in november 1999, the company sold fairchild publications which it had
acquired in connection with the abc acquisition in 1996. in november 1998, the
company acquired a 43% interest in infoseek, a publicly traded internet search
company and then in november 1999 acquired the remaining 57% of infoseek,
launched go.com and created the disney internet group tracking stock. on march
20, 2001, the company converted its internet group common stock into disney
common stock and closed the go.com portal business. to enhance comparability,
the unaudited pro forma information that follows presents consolidated results
of operations as if the fairchild disposition, the completion of the infoseek
acquisition, the conversion of the internet group common stock, the closure of
the go.com portal business and the adoption of sop 00-2 (see notes 1 and 2 to
the consolidated financial statements) had occurred at the beginning of fiscal
2000, eliminating the one-time impact of those events. the unaudited pro forma
information is not necessarily reflective of the results of operations had
these events actually occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2000, nor is it
necessarily indicative of future results.
management believes that pro forma operating results provide additional
information useful in analyzing the underlying business results. however, pro
forma operating results should be considered in addition to, not as a
substitute for, as-reported results of operations.

businesses and the cumulative effect of accounting changes, pro forma net
income and earnings per share decreased 43% and 42% to $879 million and $0.42

business segment results
the company has changed the reporting structure of the various components of
its internet operations and as a result, the internet group will no longer be
reported as a separate segment. the espn, abc, disney and family-branded
internet web sites will be reported in the media networks segment and
disneyvacations.com will be reported in the parks & resorts segment. also
during the year, the disney store catalog and the disney store online were
reassigned from the internet group to consumer products. these changes have
been reflected in the fiscal 2001 financial statements and prior-year amounts
have been reclassified to reflect the current year presentation.

2001 vs. 2000
revenues decreased 2%, or $232 million, to $9.6 billion, driven by decreases
of $566 million at broadcasting, partially offset by increases of $334 million
at the cable networks. the decrease at broadcasting was driven by lower ratings
and the soft advertising market at the abc television network and the company's
owned television stations and radio operations. additionally, revenue declines
at the television network reflected lower sports advertising revenues due to
abc airing the super bowl in the prior year. the increase at the cable networks
was driven by annual contractual rate adjustments at espn combined with
subscriber growth at espn, the disney channel domestically and internationally,
partially offset by the soft advertising market during the year. subscriber
growth at the disney channel reflected increasing satellite (dbs) and digital
subscribers and the continuing conversion of the disney channel from a premium
to a basic service.
segment operating income decreased 13%, or $257 million, to $1.8 billion,
driven by a decrease of $305 million at broadcasting resulting primarily from
decreased revenues and higher programming costs, partially offset by an
increase of $48 million at the cable networks, driven by revenue growth. costs
and expenses, which consist primarily of programming rights and amortization,
production costs, distribution and selling expenses and labor costs, remained
flat for the year, but increased as a percentage of revenue. the company
experienced higher programming costs at espn, the primetime abc television
network and the company's owned television stations and radio operations and
start-up costs at the international disney channels, offset by lower sports
programming costs at the abc television network due to higher costs for the
super bowl and two additional national football league (nfl) regular season
games in the prior year and lower costs at the internet group due to the
closure of toysmart.com in the prior year and cost saving initiatives.
the company has various contractual commitments for the purchase of
broadcast rights for sports and other programming including the nfl, major
league baseball (mlb) and the national hockey league (nhl). the costs of these
contracts have increased significantly in recent years. the company has
implemented a variety of strategies, including marketing efforts, to reduce the
impact of the higher
-28-
costs. the impact of these contracts on the company's results over the
remaining term of the contracts is dependent upon a number of factors,
including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing
efforts and the size of viewer audiences.
the costs of these contracts are charged to expense based on the ratio of
each period's gross revenues to estimated total gross revenues over the
remaining contract period. estimates of total gross revenues can change
significantly and, accordingly, they are reviewed periodically and amortization
and carrying amounts are adjusted, if necessary. such adjustments could have a
material effect on results of operations in future periods.
the company has investments in cable operations that are accounted for as
unconsolidated equity investments. the table below presents operating income

note: operating income from cable television activities presented in this
table represents 100% of both the company's owned cable businesses and its
cable equity investees. the disney share of operating income represents the
company's ownership interest in cable television operating income. cable
networks are reported in "segment operating income" in the statements of
income. equity investments are reported in "equity in the income of
investees" in the statements of income.
(1) amounts include the gain on the sale of eurosport in fiscal 2000. excluding
disney's share of the gain, cable television operating income for the year
ended september 30, 2000 was $1,126 million.
we believe that operating income from cable television activities provides
additional information useful in analyzing the underlying business results.
however, operating income from cable television activities is a non-gaap
financial metric and should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute
for, segment operating income.
the company's share of cable television operating income increased 2%, or
$28 million, to $1.2 billion. excluding the prior-year gain on eurosport, the
company's share of cable television operating income increased 9%, reflecting
higher affiliate revenues at the cable networks driven by annual contractual
rate adjustments and strong subscriber growth, including the conversion of the
disney channel from a premium to a basic service, and profit increases from
cable equity investments, partially offset by higher programming costs and the
soft advertising market at the cable network.
2000 vs. 1999
revenues increased 23%, or $1.8 billion, to $9.8 billion, driven by
increases of $1.2 billion at broadcasting and $636 million at the cable
networks. broadcasting revenue growth reflected
-29-
increased advertising revenues at the television networks and the company's
owned television stations due to a strong advertising market, the continued
success of who wants to be a millionaire and higher overall ratings on network
programming. television station revenue growth also benefited from higher spot
advertising rates driven by the abc television network placing first in the may
and february sweeps. additionally, the strong advertising market resulted in
revenue growth at the radio networks and stations. revenue growth also
reflected higher advertising and sponsorship revenues at the internet group, as
well as the operations of infoseek, which were consolidated into the internet
group beginning november 1999. cable network revenue growth reflected increased
advertising revenues driven by a strong advertising market and higher affiliate
fees reflecting contractual rate increases and subscriber growth. international
expansion at the disney channel also contributed to increased revenues.
segment operating income increased 31%, or $473 million, to $2.0 billion,
driven by increases of $399 million at broadcasting and $74 million at the
cable networks, resulting from revenue growth at both broadcasting and cable
networks, partially offset by increased costs and expenses. costs and expenses,
which consist primarily of programming rights and amortization, production
costs, distribution and selling expenses and labor costs, increased 21%, or
$1.4 billion, driven by higher sports programming costs at the television and
cable networks, principally related to nfl, mlb and nhl broadcasts. in
addition, higher costs and expenses reflected start-up costs associated with
the launch of various international disney channels and the january launch of
soapnet. costs and expenses at the internet group also increased due to website
development expenses, growth in infrastructure due to the expansion of the
business, the operations of toysmart.com and the operations of infoseek.
parks & resorts
2001 vs. 2000
revenues increased 3%, or $195 million, to $7.0 billion, driven primarily by
growth of $278 million at the disneyland resort, $44 million from disney cruise
line and $20 million in higher royalties from tokyo disneyland, partially
offset by a decrease of $187 million at the walt disney world resort. at the
disneyland resort, the opening of disney's california adventure, downtown
disney and the grand californian hotel during the second quarter drove
increased attendance, higher occupied room nights and increased guest spending.
disney cruise line's results reflected the strength of the 7-day cruise package
that was introduced in the fourth quarter of the prior year. at walt disney
world, decreased revenues were driven by decreased attendance and lower
occupied room nights reflecting the prior year success of the millennium
celebration, partially offset by increased guest spending. both the disneyland
resort and walt disney world resort were impacted by park closures on september
11/th/ and from lower attendance and hotel occupancy due to cancellations and
reduced travel during the last three weeks of september.
segment operating income decreased 2%, or $29 million, to $1.6 billion,
driven by increased costs at the disneyland resort, partially offset by revenue
growth at disneyland, continued growth at disney cruise line and on going
productivity improvements and cost reduction initiatives at walt disney world.
costs and expenses, which consist principally of labor, costs of merchandise,
food and beverages sold, depreciation, repairs and maintenance, entertainment
and marketing and sales expense, increased 4% or $224 million. higher costs at
the disneyland resort were due to the opening of disney's california adventure,
downtown disney and the grand californian hotel.
2000 vs. 1999
revenues increased 11%, or $668 million, to $6.8 billion, driven by growth
of $383 million at the walt disney world resort, reflecting increased guest
spending, record attendance and record occupied
-30-
room nights; $129 million from disney cruise line, reflecting full-year
operations from both cruise ships, the disney magic and the disney wonder,
compared to just the disney magic for the first three and a half quarters of
the prior year; and $35 million from increased attendance and guest spending at
disneyland. increased guest spending and record attendance at the walt disney
world resort were driven by the ongoing millennium celebration and record
occupied room nights reflected the opening of the all-star movies resort in the
second quarter of the prior year. at disneyland, the 45/th/ anniversary
celebration and the strength of the annual passport program drove increased
attendance and guest spending.
segment operating income increased 8%, or $121 million, to $1.6 billion,
driven by revenue growth at the walt disney world resort, improved results at
disney cruise line and higher guest spending and attendance at disneyland,
partially offset by increased costs and expenses. costs and expenses, which
consist principally of labor, costs of merchandise, food and beverages sold,
depreciation, repairs and maintenance, entertainment and marketing and sales
expenses, increased 12%, or $547 million, driven by increased volume at the
walt disney world resort resulting from the ongoing millennium celebration,
expanded operations at disney cruise line as a result of the addition of the
second ship and increased volume at disneyland due to the 45/th/ anniversary
celebration, as well as pre-opening costs at disney's california adventure.
studio entertainment
2001 vs. 2000
revenues increased 2%, or $95 million, to $6.1 billion, driven by growth of
$316 million in worldwide home video and $126 million in stage plays, partially
offset by a decline of $306 million in worldwide theatrical motion picture
distribution. improvements in worldwide home video revenues reflected strong
dvd and vhs performance driven by successful animated titles including
disney/pixar's toy story 2,  dinosaurs, the emperor's new groove and lady & the
tramp ii and stronger performing live-action titles including spy kids, scary
movie, gone in 60 seconds and remember the titans. growth in stage plays
reflected performances of the lion king in additional cities and improved
performance of aida. in worldwide theatrical motion picture distribution, the
success of pearl harbor, spy kids and princess diaries, faced difficult
comparisons to prior year titles, which included toy story 2, tarzan, dinosaur,
scary movie and the sixth sense.
on a pro forma basis, segment operating income increased $184 million, to
$260 million, due to increases in worldwide home video and stage plays. costs
and expenses, which consist primarily of production cost amortization,
distribution and selling expenses, product costs, labor and leasehold expenses,
decreased 1%, or $89 million, driven by decreases in worldwide theatrical
motion picture distribution, partially offset by increases in worldwide home
video. in worldwide theatrical motion picture distribution, cost decreases
reflected lower distribution expenses and production costs amortization in the
current year as well as higher participation expenses in the prior year, due to
toy story 2 and the sixth sense. the increased costs in worldwide home video
reflected higher distribution expense and production costs amortization driven
by an increase in vhs and dvd unit sales and higher participation costs due to
the success of toy story 2 in the current year. stage plays operating expenses
also increased due to more productions in the current year.
on an as-reported basis, segment operating income increased $134 million, to
$260 million, reflecting the items described above, as well as the impact of
sop 00-2 in the current year, which resulted in higher distribution and
marketing costs as compared to the prior year.
2000 vs. 1999
revenues decreased 3%, or $165 million, to $6.0 billion, driven by declines
of $206 million in network television production and distribution, $168 million
in worldwide home video and $58
-31-
million in domestic theatrical motion picture distribution, partially offset by
growth of $197 million in international theatrical motion picture distribution
and $88 million in stage plays. the decline in network television production
and distribution revenues primarily reflected the end of production of home
improvement in the prior year, which was a significant contributor to revenues.
the decline in worldwide home video revenues reflected fewer unit sales in the
current year, despite the successful releases of tarzan and little mermaid ii:
return to sea, as the prior year included the combination of lion king ii:
simba's pride, mulan, armageddon and disney/pixar's a bug's life. in domestic
theatrical motion picture distribution, the success of scary movie, dinosaur
and toy story 2 faced difficult comparisons to the prior year. growth in
international theatrical motion picture distribution revenues reflected the
performances of toy story 2, tarzan and the sixth sense. stage plays revenues
increased due to expansion of the lion king into additional cities, the launch
of aida and the re-launch of the beauty and the beast national tour.
segment operating income decreased 22%, or $36 million, to $126 million, due
to declines in worldwide home video and network television production and
distribution, partially offset by growth in international theatrical motion
picture distribution and stage plays. costs and expenses, which consist
primarily of production cost amortization, distribution and selling expenses,
product costs, labor and leasehold expenses, decreased 2% or $129 million.
production cost amortization decreased in network television production and
distribution reflecting the production of home improvement in the prior year.
in worldwide home video, distribution and selling costs and production cost
amortization decreased due to a reduction in videotape unit sales compared to
the prior year. the sixth sense, which drove higher participation costs in
domestic theatrical motion picture distribution in the prior year, had a
similar impact in international theatrical motion picture distribution in the
current year. cost increases in international theatrical motion picture
distribution also reflected higher overall production cost amortization. stage
plays operating expenses also increased driven by revenue increases.
consumer products
2001 vs. 2000
on a pro forma basis, revenues decreased 6%, or $158 million, to $2.6
billion, primarily reflecting declines of $157 million at the disney stores,
which were driven by lower comparative store sales in north america.
on an as-reported basis, revenues decreased 6% or $172 million, to $2.6
billion, reflecting the items described above, as well as the impact of the
disposition of fairchild publications in the first quarter of the prior year.
segment operating income increased 4%, or $16 million, to $401 million,
primarily driven by benefits from cost reduction initiatives, partially offset
by declines at the disney stores in north america. costs and expenses, which
consist primarily of labor, product costs, including product development costs,
distribution and selling expenses and leasehold expenses, decreased 7% or $174
million, primarily due to lower sales volume at the disney stores in north
america, decreased catalog circulation and advertising costs and the impact of
cost reduction initiatives including the disney store in europe.
2000 vs. 1999
revenues decreased 12%, or $364 million, to $2.8 billion, reflecting
declines of $163 million at fairchild publications, $135 million in worldwide
merchandise licensing and publishing, partially offset by growth of $22 million
at disney interactive. revenues decreased at fairchild publications as it was
sold in the first quarter of fiscal 2000. lower merchandise licensing and
publishing revenues were primarily attributable to declines domestically and in
europe. disney interactive revenues increased
-32-
due to the success of the who wants to be a millionaire video games, pooh
learning titles and the toy story 2 action game.
segment operating income decreased 35%, or $206 million, to $386 million,
reflecting declines in worldwide merchandise licensing and publishing and the
sale of fairchild publications, partially offset by increases at the disney
stores, primarily driven by a reduction in costs, and at disney interactive.
costs and expenses decreased 6% or $158 million. cost decreases at the disney
stores, which reflected write-downs of inventory in the prior year, were
partially offset by an increase in advertising costs.
liquidity and capital resources
cash provided by operations decreased 19%, or $707 million, to $3.0 billion,
reflecting decreased pretax income before non-cash charges, increased payments
for television broadcast rights, primarily due to the timing of the nfl
payments and increased license fees for primetime programming and the timing of
the payments of accounts payable. these decreases were partially offset by
lower income tax payments. additionally, the prior year included proceeds from
the sale of receivables at disney vacation club. these decreases were partially
offset by higher net income before non-cash charges.
during the year, the company invested $1.8 billion in parks, resorts and
other properties. these expenditures reflected continued expansion activities
related to disney's california adventure and certain resort facilities at the
walt disney world resort. the decrease from the prior year was primarily due to
lower spending on disney's california adventure, which opened in february 2001.
during the year, the company invested $480 million to acquire the copyright
for certain intellectual property, radio station and publishing assets and the
rights to a music library.
in fiscal 2001, investing activities also included $137 million of cash
proceeds generated primarily from the sale of infoseek japan, k.k.
additionally, cash proceeds from the sale of investments resulted primarily
from the sale of knight-ridder, inc. shares which were acquired in connection
with the disposition of certain publishing operations. during fiscal 2000,
investing activities included cash proceeds from the sale of fairchild
publications and eurosport. fiscal 2000 cash proceeds from the sale of
investments were driven by the sale of inktomi shares acquired through the
disposition of ultraseek.
during 1998, the company's board of directors decided to move to an annual,
rather than quarterly, dividend policy to reduce costs and simplify payments to
the more than 2.7 million stockholders of disney common stock. accordingly,
there was no dividend payment during the year ended september 30, 1999. the
company paid a $434 million dividend ($0.21 per disney share) during the first
quarter of fiscal 2000 applicable to fiscal 1999 and paid a $438 million
dividend ($0.21 per disney share) during the first quarter of the current year
applicable to fiscal 2000. on november 27, 2001, the board of directors
declared a cash dividend, applicable to fiscal 2001, of $0.21 per share, to be
paid on december 21, 2001, to stockholders at the close of business december 7,
2001.
during the year, the company repaid approximately $2.8 billion of term debt,
which either matured or was called during the year, and reduced its commercial
paper borrowings by $186 million. these repayments were funded by proceeds of
$3.1 billion consisting of $2.5 billion of global bonds and $50 million of
fixed-rate notes issued under the u.s. shelf registration, and $530 million of
fixed-rate notes issued under the euro medium-term note program. these
borrowings have effective interest rates, including the impact of interest rate
swaps, ranging from 3.5% to 5.9% and maturities in fiscal 2003 through fiscal
2016. see note 5 of the consolidated financial statements for more detailed
information regarding the company's borrowings.
-33-
in august 2001, the company filed a new u.s. shelf registration statement,
which replaced the existing u.s. shelf registration statement. as of september
30, 2001, the company had the ability to borrow under the u.s. shelf
registration statement and a euro medium-term note program, which collectively
permitted the issuance of up to approximately $8.1 billion of additional debt
or various other securities.
commercial paper borrowings outstanding as of september 30, 2001 totaled
$754 million, with maturities of up to one year, supported by a $2.25 billion
bank facility due in 2002 and a $2.25 billion bank facility due in 2005. these
bank facilities allow for borrowings at the libor-based rates plus a spread,
depending upon the company's public debt rating. as of september 30, 2001, the
company had not borrowed against these bank facilities.
total commitments to purchase broadcast programming approximated $13.2
billion at september 30, 2001, including approximately $10.1 billion related to
sports programming rights, primarily nfl, college football and mlb.
substantially all of this amount is payable over the next five years.
the company expects the abc television network, espn and the company's
television and radio stations to continue to enter into programming commitments
to purchase the broadcast rights for various feature films, sports and other
programming.
during the year, the company acquired approximately 63.9 million shares of
disney common stock and 1.8 million shares of internet group common stock for
approximately $1.1 billion and $10 million, respectively. as of september 30,
2001, the company was authorized to purchase up to approximately 330 million
shares of disney common stock.
on october 24, 2001, the company acquired fox family worldwide for $5.2
billion, including $2.9 billion in cash and the assumption of $2.3 billion in
debt and preferred stock. the company funded the acquisition with cash on hand
as well as short and long-term debt issuances. in connection with the
acquisition, the company acquired programming commitments totaling
approximately $1 billion, including approximately $675 million for certain mlb
games through 2006.
following the acquisition of fox family worldwide, the company had
commercial paper borrowings outstanding of approximately $3.8 billion supported
by bank facilities totaling $4.5 billion and capacity to raise an additional
$7.1 billion under its u.s. shelf registration and its euro medium-term note
program.
the company believes that its financial condition is strong and that its
cash, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to equity capital
markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate resources to
fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to
the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. however,
the company's operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can be
impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. in addition to
macroeconomic factors, the company's borrowing costs can be impacted by short
and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are
based, in significant part, on certain credit measures such as interest
coverage and leverage ratios.
other matters
conversion to the euro currency
on january 1, 1999, certain member countries of the european union
established fixed conversion rates between their existing currencies and the
european union's common currency (euro). the transition period for the
introduction of the euro ends january 1, 2002. issues facing the company as a
result of the introduction of the euro include converting information
technology systems, reassessing currency risk, negotiating and amending
licensing agreements and contracts, and processing tax and
-34-
accounting records. the company is continuing to address these issues and does
not expect the euro to have a material effect on the company's financial
condition or results of operations.
accounting changes
effective october 1, 2000, the company adopted aicpa statement of position
no. 00-2, accounting by producers or distributors of films (sop 00-2). the
company's results of operations and financial position reflect the impact of
the new standard commencing october 1, 2000 and the company recorded a one-time
after-tax charge of $228 million representing the cumulative effect of the
adoption of sop 00-2 in its consolidated financial statements for the year
ended september 30, 2001.
in june 1998, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued
statement of financial accounting standards no. 133 accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities (sfas 133), subsequently amended by sfas no.
137 and sfas no. 138. sfas 133 requires the company to record all derivatives
on the balance sheet at fair value. changes in derivative fair values will
either be recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of
related hedged assets, liabilities and firm commitments or, for forecasted
transactions, deferred and recorded as a component of other accumulated
comprehensive income until the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in
earnings. the ineffective portion of a hedging derivative's change in fair
value will be immediately recognized in earnings.
as a result of adopting sfas 133 as of october 1, 2000, and in accordance
with the transition provisions, the company recorded a one-time after-tax
charge of $50 million, or $0.02 per share, in its consolidated statements of
income representing the cumulative effect of the adoption and an after-tax
unrealized gain of $60 million to accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci).
in july 2001, the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards
no. 141, business combinations (sfas 141) and statement of financial accounting
standards no. 142, goodwill and other intangible assets (sfas 142). they also
issued statement of financial accounting standards no. 143, accounting for
obligations associated with the retirement of long-lived assets (sfas 143), and
statement of financial accounting standards no. 144, accounting for the
impairment or disposal of long-lived assets (sfas 144), in august and october
2001, respectively.
sfas 141 requires all business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001 be
accounted for under the purchase method. sfas 141 superseded apb opinion no.
16, business combinations, and statement of financial accounting standards no.
38, accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises and is
effective for all business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001.
sfas 142 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for acquired
goodwill and other intangible assets. under the new rules, the company is no
longer required to amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives but will be subject to periodic testing for impairment. sfas
142 supersedes apb opinion no. 17, intangible assets. effective october 1,
2001, the company will adopt sfas 142 and is evaluating the effect that such
adoption may have on its consolidated results of operations and financial
position.
as a result of adoption, a substantial amount of its intangible assets will
no longer be amortized and accordingly, the company's effective tax rate is
expected to decrease substantially in fiscal 2002. the impact of intangible
asset amortization that would not have been amortized pursuant to sfas 142
during fiscal 2001 on diluted earnings per share was $0.26.
sfas 143 establishes accounting standards for the recognition and
measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset
retirement cost. it also provides accounting guidance for
-35-
legal obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets.
sfas 143 is effective in fiscal years beginning after june 15, 2002, with early
adoption permitted. the company expects that the provisions of sfas 143 will
not have a material impact on its consolidated results of operations and
financial position upon adoption. the company plans to adopt sfas 143 effective
october 1, 2002.
sfas 144 establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or
disposal of long-lived assets, including discontinued operations. sfas 144
superseded statement of financial accounting standards no. 121, accounting for
the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of
and apb opinion no. 30, reporting the results of operations--reporting the
effects of disposal of a segment of a business, and extraordinary, unusual and
infrequently occurring events and transactions. the provisions of sfas 144 are
effective in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2001, with early
adoption permitted and, in general, are to be applied prospectively. the
company plans to adopt sfas 144 effective october 1, 2001 and does not expect
that the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated results of
operations and financial position.
forward-looking statements
the private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor
for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. we may from
time to time make written or oral statements that are "forward-looking,"
including statements contained in this report and other filings with the
securities and exchange commission and in reports to our stockholders. such
statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future
actions that we may take, including restructuring or strategic initiatives or
about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global
economic conditions. these statements are made on the basis of management's
views and assumptions as of the time the statements are made. there can be no
assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass.
factors that may affect forward-looking statements. for an enterprise as
large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors could materially
affect future developments and performance, including the following:
changes in company-wide or business-unit strategies, which may result in
changes in the types or mix of businesses in which the company is involved
or chooses to invest;
changes in u.s., global or regional economic conditions, which may affect
attendance and spending at the company's parks and resorts, purchases of
company-licensed consumer products, the advertising market for broadcast and
cable television programming and the performance of the company's theatrical
and home entertainment releases;
changes in u.s. and global financial and equity markets, including market
disruptions and significant interest rate fluctuations, which may impede the
company's access to, or increase the cost of, external financing for its
operations and investments;
increased competitive pressures, both domestically and internationally,
which may, among other things, affect the performance of the company's parks
and resorts operations and lead to increased expenses in such areas as
television programming acquisition and motion picture production and
marketing;
legal and regulatory developments that may affect particular business units,
such as regulatory actions affecting environmental activities, consumer
products, theme park safety, broadcasting or internet activities or the
protection of intellectual property; the imposition by foreign countries of
trade restrictions or motion picture or television content requirements or
quotas, and changes in international tax laws or currency controls;
-36-
adverse weather conditions or natural disasters, such as hurricanes and
earthquakes, which may, among other things, impair performance at the
company's parks and resorts;
technological developments that may affect the distribution of the company's
creative products or create new risks to the company's ability to protect
its intellectual property;
labor disputes, which may lead to increased costs or disruption of
operations in any of the company's business units;
changing public and consumer taste, which may among other things, affect the
company's entertainment, broadcasting and consumer products businesses
generally or the company's parks and resorts operating specifically, or
result in increases in broadcasting losses or loss of advertising revenue;
and
international, political and military developments that may affect among
other things, travel and leisure businesses generally or the company's parks
and resorts operations specifically, or result in increases in broadcasting
costs or loss of advertising revenue.
this list of factors that may affect future performance and the accuracy of
forward-looking statements is illustrative, but by no means exhaustive.
accordingly, all forward-looking statements should be evaluated with the
understanding of their inherent uncertainty.
item 7a. market risk
the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign
currency fluctuations and changes in the market values of its investments.
policies and procedures
in the normal course of business, the company employs established policies
and procedures to manage its exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign
currencies and the fair market value of certain of its investments in debt and
equity securities using a variety of financial instruments.
our objective in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the
impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall
borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate
swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the company's
portfolio of borrowings. the company maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage
of its net debt between a minimum and maximum percentage, which is set by
policy.
our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is to
reduce earnings and cash flow volatility in order to allow management to focus
on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into
various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to
protect the value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities,
commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues. the company utilizes
option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign
currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly committed, revenues. the company
also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities in
the same principal currencies. the principal currencies hedged are the european
euro, british pound, japanese yen and canadian dollar. by policy, the company
maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its
forecasted foreign exchange exposures for periods not to exceed five years. the
gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the value of the related
exposures.
in addition, we use various financial instruments to minimize the exposure
to changes in fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity
securities.
-37-
it is the company's policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate
transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered
necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the company does not enter
into these transactions for speculative purposes.
value at risk
the company utilizes a "value-at-risk" (var) model to determine the maximum
potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange
and qualifying equity sensitive financial instruments. the var model estimates
were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various
modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the company's
computations are based on the interrelationships between movements in various
interest rates, currencies and equity prices (a "variance/co-variance"
technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest
rate, foreign currency and equity market changes over the preceding quarter for
the calculation of var amounts at year-end and over each of the four quarters
for the calculation of average var amounts during the year. the model includes
all of the company's debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange
derivative contracts and qualifying equity investments. the values of foreign
exchange options do not change on a one-to-one basis with the underlying
currencies, as exchange rates vary. therefore, the hedge coverage assumed to be
obtained from each option has been adjusted to reflect its respective
sensitivity to changes in currency values. forecasted transactions, firm
commitments and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign
currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were
excluded from the model.
the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent
actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it
consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors. see note
12 to the consolidated financial statements regarding the company's financial
instruments at september 30, 2001 and 2000.
the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using
the var model, is as follows (unaudited, in millions):

rate sensitive  sensitive   sensitive

significant accounting policies
principles of consolidation
the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of
the walt disney company and its subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany
accounts and transactions. in december 1999, dvd financing, inc. (dfi), a
subsidiary of disney vacation development, inc. and an indirect subsidiary of
the company, completed a receivable sale transaction. in connection with this
sale, dfi prepares separate financial statements, although its separate assets
and liabilities are also consolidated in these financial statements.
accounting changes
effective october 1, 2000, the company adopted two new accounting
pronouncements, aicpa statement of position no. 00-2, accounting by producers
or distributors of films (sop 00-2) and statement of financial accounting
standards no. 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
(sfas 133), subsequently amended by statement of financial accounting standards
no. 138 (sfas 138).
sop 00-2 establishes new accounting standards for producers and distributors
of films, which resulted in changes in revenue recognition and accounting for
exploitation costs, including advertising and marketing expenses and
development and overhead costs. as a result of the adoption of sop 00-2, the
company recorded a one-time after-tax charge of $228 million, or $0.11 per
share, representing the cumulative effect of the adoption. the charge
represents costs that were capitalized as of september 30, 2000, that would
have been expensed under the new rules. the adoption of sop 00-2 did not have a
material impact on the current fiscal year's operating results.
sfas 133 and sfas 138 require that the company record all derivatives on the
balance sheet at fair value. there are two types of derivatives into which the
company enters: hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure.
hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value
of a recognized asset or liability, or a firm commitment. hedges of cash flow
exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction or the
variability of cash flows to be paid related to a recognized liability. on the
date on which the derivative contract is executed, the
-52-
company designates the derivative as either a fair value hedge or a cash flow
hedge. changes in derivative fair values that are designated as fair value
hedges are recognized in earnings as offsets to the changes in fair value of
related hedged assets, liabilities and firm commitments. changes in the
derivative fair values that are designated as cash flow hedges are deferred and
recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci) until
the hedged transactions occur and are recognized in earnings. the ineffective
portion of a hedging derivative's change in fair value is immediately
recognized in earnings. derivatives that are executed for risk management
purposes but not designated as hedges under sfas 133 and sfas 138 are recorded
at their market value and recognized in current earnings.
the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments
and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for
undertaking various hedge transactions. the company links all hedges that are
designated as fair value hedges to specific assets or liabilities on the
balance sheet or to specific firm commitments. the company links all hedges
that are designated as cash flow hedges to forecasted transactions or to
floating-rate liabilities on the balance sheet. the company also assesses, both
at the inception of the hedge and on an on-going basis, whether the derivatives
that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting
changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. should it be determined
that a derivative is not highly effective as a hedge, the company will
discontinue hedge accounting prospectively.
as a result of adopting sfas 133 as of october 1, 2000, and in accordance
with the transition provisions, the company recorded a one-time after-tax
charge of $50 million, or $0.02 per share, in its consolidated statements of
income representing the cumulative effect of the adoption, and an after-tax
unrealized gain of $60 million to aoci. amounts expected to be reclassified to
earnings over the next twelve months are not material. the company reclassified
a $16 million after-tax gain from aoci to earnings during fiscal 2001, which
was offset by net losses on items being hedged. the adoption of sfas 133 did
not have a material impact on the current fiscal year's operating results.
during the year, the company recorded the change in value related to cash
flow hedges to aoci, which was not material. in addition, the company
reclassified deferred losses related to certain cash flow hedges from aoci to
earnings, due to the uncertainty of the timing of the original forecasted
transaction.
during the year, the company recorded the change in fair market value
related to fair value hedges and the ineffectiveness related to cash flow
hedges to earnings. these amounts were not material.
in july 2001, the financial accounting standards board issued statement of
financial accounting standards no. 141, business combinations (sfas 141), and
statement of financial accounting standards no. 142, goodwill and other
intangible assets (sfas 142). they also issued statement of financial
accounting standards no. 143, accounting for obligations associated with the
retirement of long-lived assets (sfas 143), and statement of financial
accounting standards no. 144, accounting for the impairment or disposal of
long-lived assets (sfas 144), in august and october 2001, respectively.
sfas 141 requires all business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001 be
accounted for under the purchase method. sfas 141 supersedes apb opinion no.
16, business combinations, and statement of financial accounting standards no.
38, accounting for preacquisition contingencies of purchased enterprises, and
is effective for all business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001.
sfas 142 addresses the financial accounting and reporting for acquired
goodwill and other intangible assets. under the new rules, the company is no
longer required to amortize goodwill and other intangible assets with
indefinite lives, but will be subject to periodic testing for impairment.
-53-
sfas 142 supersedes apb opinion no. 17, intangible assets. effective october 1,
2001, the company will adopt sfas 142 and is evaluating the effect that such
adoption may have on its consolidated results of operations and financial
position. however, the company expects that a substantial amount of its
intangible assets will no longer be amortized.
sfas 143 establishes accounting standards for the recognition and
measurement of an asset retirement obligation and its associated asset
retirement cost. it also provides accounting guidance for legal obligations
associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets. sfas 143 is
effective in fiscal years beginning after june 15, 2002, with early adoption
permitted. the company expects that the provisions of sfas 143 will not have a
material impact on its consolidated results of operations and financial
position upon adoption. the company plans to adopt sfas 143 effective october
1, 2002.
sfas 144 establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or
disposal of long-lived assets, including discontinued operations. sfas 144
superseded statement of financial accounting standards no. 121, accounting for
the impairment of long-lived assets and for long-lived assets to be disposed of
(sfas 121), and apb opinion no. 30, reporting the results of operations--
reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business, and extraordinary,
unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions. the provisions of
sfas 144 are effective in fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2001, with
early adoption permitted, and in general are to be applied prospectively. the
company plans to adopt sfas 144 effective october 1, 2001 and does not expect
that the adoption will have a material impact on its consolidated results of
operations and financial position.
use of estimates
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and
footnotes thereto. actual results may differ from those estimates.
revenue recognition
revenues from the theatrical distribution of motion pictures are recognized
when motion pictures are exhibited. revenues from video sales are recognized on
the date that video units are made widely available for sale by retailers.
revenues from the licensing of feature films and television programming are
recorded when the material is available for telecasting by the licensee and
when certain other conditions are met.
broadcast advertising revenues are recognized when commercials are aired.
revenues from television subscription services related to the company's primary
cable programming services are recognized as services are provided.
internet advertising revenues are recognized on the basis of impression
views in the period the advertising is displayed, provided that no significant
obligations remain and collection of the resulting receivable is probable.
direct marketing and internet-based merchandise revenues are recognized upon
shipment to customers.
merchandise licensing advance and guarantee payments are recognized when the
underlying royalties are earned.
revenues from advance theme park ticket sales are recognized when the
tickets are used. revenues from participants at the theme parks are generally
recorded over the period of the applicable agreements commencing with the
opening of the related attraction.
-54-
cash and cash equivalents
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and marketable securities
with original maturities of three months or less.
investments
debt securities that the company has the positive intent and ability to hold
to maturity are classified as "held-to-maturity" and reported at amortized
cost. debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity and marketable equity
securities are classified as either "trading" or "available-for-sale," and are
recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings or
stockholders' equity, respectively. all other equity securities are accounted
for using either the cost method or the equity method.
the company continually reviews its investments to determine whether a
decline in fair value below the cost basis is other than temporary. if the
decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of
the security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write-down is
included in the consolidated statements of income.
inventories
carrying amounts of merchandise, materials and supplies inventories are
generally determined on a moving average cost basis and are stated at the lower
of cost or market.
film and television costs
film and television costs that are produced for sale to third parties are
stated at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value.
programming costs for the company's television and cable networks are stated at
the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or net realizable value.
television broadcast program licenses and rights and related liabilities are
recorded when the license period begins and the program is available for use.
film and television production and participation costs are expensed based on
the ratio of the current period's gross revenues to estimated total gross
revenues from all sources on an individual production basis. television network
and station rights for theatrical movies and other long-form programming are
charged to expense primarily on accelerated bases related to the usage of the
programs. television network series costs and multi-year sports rights are
charged to expense based on the ratio of the current period's gross revenues to
estimated total gross revenues from such programs.
estimates of total gross revenues can change significantly due to a variety
of factors, including the level of market acceptance of film and television
products, advertising rates and subscriber fees. accordingly, revenue estimates
are reviewed periodically and amortization is adjusted, if necessary. such
adjustments could have a material effect on results of operations in future
periods. the net realizable value of television broadcast program licenses and
rights is reviewed using a daypart methodology.
parks, resorts and other property
parks, resorts and other property are carried at cost. depreciation is
computed on the straight-line method based upon estimated useful lives ranging
from three to fifty years.
-55-
intangible and other assets
intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from two to forty
years. the company continually reviews the recoverability of the carrying value
of these assets using the methodology prescribed in sfas 121. the company also
reviews long-lived assets and the related intangible assets for impairment
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of
such assets may not be recoverable. upon such an occurrence, recoverability of
these assets is determined by comparing the forecasted undiscounted net cash
flows of the operation to which the assets relate, to the carrying amount,
including associated intangible assets, of such operation. if the operation is
determined to be unable to recover the carrying amount of its assets, then
intangible assets are written down first, followed by the other long-lived
assets of the operation, to fair value. fair value is determined based on
discounted cash flows, appraised values or management's estimates, depending
upon the nature of the assets.
risk management contracts
in the normal course of business, the company employs a variety of financial
instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest, foreign
currency exchange rates and investments in equity and debt securities,
including interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements; forward, option and
swaption contracts, and interest rate caps.
the company designates and assigns the financial instruments as hedges of
forecasted transactions, specific assets, or specific liabilities. when hedged
assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished or the forecasted transactions
being hedged are no longer expected to occur, the company recognizes the gain
or loss on the designated hedging financial instruments.
option premiums and unrealized losses on forward contracts and the accrued
differential for interest rate and cross-currency swaps to be received under
the agreements are recorded in the balance sheet as other assets. unrealized
gains on forward contracts and the accrued differential for interest rate and
cross-currency swaps to be paid under the agreements are included in accounts
payable and other accrued liabilities. realized gains and losses from hedges
are classified in the income statement consistent with the accounting treatment
of the items being hedged. the company accrues the differential for interest
rate and cross-currency swaps to be paid or received under the agreements as
interest and exchange rates shift as adjustments to net interest expense over
the lives of the swaps. gains and losses on the termination of effective swap
agreements, prior to their original maturity, are deferred and amortized to net
interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying hedged transactions.
cash flows from hedges are classified in the consolidated statements of cash
flows under the same category as the cash flows from the related assets,
liabilities or forecasted transactions (see notes 5 and 12).
earnings per share
the company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (eps)
amounts. basic eps is calculated by dividing net income by the weighted average
number of common shares outstanding during the year. diluted eps amounts are
based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares
outstanding during the year. common equivalent shares are excluded from the
computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect. the
difference between basic and diluted eps, for the company, is solely
attributable to stock options. the company uses the treasury stock method to
calculate the impact of outstanding stock options. stock options for which the
exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period have an
anti-dilutive effect on eps and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation.
-56-
for the years ended september 30, 2001, 2000 and 1999, options for 81
million, 20 million and 28 million shares, respectively, were excluded from the
diluted eps calculation for disney common stock because they were anti-dilutive.
stock options
the company uses the intrinsic-value method of accounting for stock-based
awards granted to employees and, accordingly, does not recognize compensation
expense for its stock-based awards to employees in the consolidated statements
of income. see note 9 for pro forma information on the impact of the fair-value
method of accounting for stock options.
reclassifications
certain reclassifications have been made in the 2000 and 1999 financial
statements to conform to the 2001 presentation.
2 acquisitions and dispositions
on march 20, 2001, the company converted all of its outstanding internet
group common stock into disney common stock, resulting in the issuance of
approximately 8.6 million shares of disney common stock. for the year ended
september 30, 2001, as-reported earnings attributed to disney common stock
reflect approximately 72% of internet group losses from october 1, 2000 through
january 28, 2001 (the last date prior to the announcement of the conversion),
and 100% thereafter. in addition, the company has ceased the operations of the
go.com portal business, which resulted in restructuring and impairment charges
of $878 million in the current year (see note 14).
in november 1999, the company sold fairchild publications, which it had
acquired as part of the 1996 acquisition of abc, inc., generating a pre-tax
gain of $243 million.
the company's consolidated results of operations have incorporated
infoseek's activity, on a consolidated basis, from november 18, 1999, the date
on which the company completed its acquisition of infoseek, and the activity of
fairchild publications through the date of its disposal. the unaudited pro
forma information below presents combined results of operations as if the
disposition of fairchild publications, the acquisition of infoseek, the
conversion of the internet group common stock into disney common stock, the
closure of the go.com portal business and the adoption of the new film
accounting rules (see note 1) had occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2000,
excluding the one-time impacts of those events. the pro forma amounts below for
the prior year exclude charges for purchased in-process research and
development costs of $23 million related to the infoseek acquisition. the
unaudited pro forma information is not necessarily indicative of the results of
operations had these events actually occurred at the beginning of fiscal 2000,
nor is it necessarily indicative of future results.

the gain on the sale of fairchild publications is reported in the line "gain
on sale of businesses" in the consolidated statements of income. also reported
in this line item are pre-tax gains on the sales of starwave corporation in
fiscal 1999 ($345 million), eurosport and ultraseek corporation in fiscal 2000
($93 million and $153 million, respectively) and infoseek japan k.k. in the
current year ($22 million).
3 investment in euro disney
euro disney operates the disneyland paris theme park and resort complex on a
4,800-acre site near paris, france. the company accounts for its 39% ownership
interest in euro disney using the equity method of accounting. as of september
30, 2001, the company's recorded investment in euro disney, including accounts
and notes receivable, was $344 million.
in connection with the financial restructuring of euro disney in 1994, euro
disney associes s.n.c. (disney snc), a wholly-owned affiliate of the company,
entered into a lease arrangement with a noncancelable term of 12 years related
to substantially all of the disneyland paris theme park assets, and then
entered into a 12-year sublease agreement with euro disney. remaining lease
rentals at september 30, 2001 of approximately $801 million receivable from
euro disney under the sublease approximate the amounts payable by disney snc
under the lease. at the conclusion of the sublease term, euro disney will have
the option to assume disney snc's rights and obligations under the lease. if
euro disney does not exercise its option, disney snc may purchase the assets,
continue to lease the assets or elect to terminate the lease, in which case
disney snc would make a termination payment to the lessor equal to 75% of the
lessor's then outstanding debt related to the theme park assets, estimated to
be $1.1 billion; disney snc could then sell or lease the assets on behalf of
the lessor to satisfy the remaining debt, with any excess proceeds payable to
disney snc.
also, as part of the restructuring, the company agreed to arrange for the
provision of a 10-year unsecured standby credit facility of approximately $152
million, upon request, bearing interest at the paris interbank offered rate
(pibor). as of september 30, 2001, there were no amounts outstanding under this
facility. however, it is expected that euro disney will draw on this line of
credit during fiscal 2002. the company also agreed, as long as any of the
restructured debt is outstanding, to maintain ownership of at least 25% of the
outstanding common stock of euro disney through june 2004 and at least 16.67%
for an additional term thereafter.
after a five-year waiver resulting from the restructuring, royalties and
management fees from euro disney were partially reinstated beginning fiscal
year 1999. as a result, the company earned approximately $28 million, $30
million and $33 million in royalties and management fees in fiscal year 2001,
2000 and 1999, respectively. royalties are to be fully reinstated beginning in
fiscal year 2004, with management fees progressively reinstated through fiscal
year 2018.
in november 1999, euro disney stockholders approved an increase in share
capital through an equity rights offering. the offering raised $238 million.
the net proceeds were used to partially finance the construction of a second
theme park, the walt disney studios, adjacent to the disneyland paris theme
park. the company subscribed to approximately $91 million of the equity rights
offering, maintaining its 39% interest in euro disney. the walt disney studios
is expected to open in march 2002.

deferred tax assets at september 30, 2001 and 2000 were reduced by a
valuation allowance relating to a portion of the tax benefits attributable to
certain net operating losses (nols) reflected on state tax returns of infoseek
and its subsidiaries for periods prior to the infoseek acquisition on november
18, 1999 (see note 2), where applicable state tax laws limit the utilization of
such nols. since the valuation allowance relates to acquired deferred tax
assets, the subsequent realization of these tax benefits would result in the
application of the allowance amount as a reduction to goodwill.
at september 30, 2001, approximately $191 million of foreign tax credit
carryforwards was available as credits against future income taxes. foreign tax
credit carryforwards will expire between the years 2003 and 2006.
in 2001, 2000 and 1999, income tax benefits attributable to employee stock
option transactions of $48 million, $197 million and $96 million, respectively,
were allocated to stockholders' equity.

7 pension and other benefit programs
the company maintains pension and postretirement medical benefit plans
covering most of its domestic employees not covered by union or industry-wide
plans. employees hired after january 1, 1994 are not eligible for
postretirement medical benefits. with respect to its qualified defined benefit
pension plans, the company's policy is to fund, at a minimum, the amount
necessary on an actuarial basis to provide for benefits in accordance with the
requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974. pension
benefits are generally based on years of service and/or compensation.
the following chart summarizes the balance sheet impact, as well as the

assets for postretirement plans with accumulated postretirement benefit
obligations in excess of plan assets were $441 million and $79 million for

assumed health care cost trend rates have a significant effect on the
amounts reported for the postretirement medical benefit plans. a one percentage
point decrease in the assumed health care cost trend rates would reduce total
service and interest costs and postretirement benefit obligations by $13
million and $98 million, respectively. a one percentage point increase in the
assumed health care cost trend rates would increase total service and interest
costs and postretirement benefit obligations by $18 million and $129 million,

trust as of september 30, 2001 and 2000 were $52 million and $107 million,
respectively.

allow eligible employees to allocate up to 10% or 15% of salary through payroll
deductions depending on the plan in which the employee participates. the
company matches 50% of the employee's pre-tax contributions, up to plan limits.
in 2001, 2000 and 1999, the costs of these plans were $32 million, $30 million

the following table reflects pro forma net income (loss) and earnings (loss)

these pro forma amounts may not be representative of future disclosures
since the estimated fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over
the vesting period, and additional options may be granted in future years.
the weighted average fair values of options at their grant date during 2001,
2000 and 1999, where the exercise price equaled the market price on the grant
date, were $10.25, $12.49 and $11.11, respectively. the estimated fair value of
each disney option granted is calculated using the black-scholes option-pricing
model. the weighted average assumptions used in the model were as follows:

11 segments
the company is in the leisure and entertainment business and has operations
in four major segments: media networks, parks & resorts, studio entertainment
and consumer products, as described in note 1. the company has changed the
reporting structure of the various components of its internet operations and as
a result, the internet group is no longer reported as a separate segment. the
espn, abc, disney and family-branded internet web sites are reported in the
media networks segment and disneyvacations.com is reported in the parks &
resorts segment. also during the year, the disney store catalog and the disney
store online were reassigned from the internet group to consumer products.
prior-year amounts have been reclassified to reflect the current year
presentation.
the operating segments reported below are the segments of the company for
which separate financial information is available and for which operating
results are evaluated regularly by executive management in deciding how to
allocate resources and in assessing performance. the accounting policies of the
business segments are the same as those described in the summary of significant
accounting policies.
-68-
segment operating results evaluated include earnings before corporate and
unallocated shared expenses, amortization of intangible assets, gain on sale of
businesses, net interest expense and other, equity in the income of investees,
restructuring and impairment charges, income taxes and minority interests.
corporate and unallocated shared expenses principally consist of executive
management and certain unallocated administrative support functions.
the following segment results include allocations of certain costs,
including certain information technology costs, pension, legal and other shared
services, which are allocated based on consumption. in addition, while all
significant intersegment transactions have been eliminated, studio
entertainment revenues and operating income include an allocation of consumer
products revenues, which is meant to reflect a portion of consumer products
revenues attributable to certain film properties. these allocations are
agreed-upon amounts between the businesses and may differ from amounts that
would be negotiated in an arm's-length transaction.

million and $663 million in 2001 and 2000, respectively, expire in three years.

interest rate risk management
the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes. the company's
objective is to manage the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash
flows and on the market value of its investments and borrowings. the company
maintains fixed rate debt as a percentage of its net debt between a minimum and
maximum percentage, which is set by policy.
significant interest rate risk management instruments held by the company
during 2001 and 2000 included pay-floating and pay-fixed swaps. pay-floating
swaps effectively convert medium and long-term obligations to libor rate
indexed variable rate instruments. these swap agreements expire in one to 20
years. pay-fixed swaps effectively convert floating rate obligations to fixed
rate instruments. the pay-fixed swaps expire in one to three years. in addition
to the $700 million of pay-fixed swaps disclosed in note 5, as of september 30,
2001, the company held $500 million of pay-fixed swaps that were de-designated
as hedges. as of september 30, 2000, the company held $186 million of
pay-floating swaps and $786 million of pay-fixed swaps that were de-designated
as hedges. the change in market values related to these swaps from the time
they were de-designated as hedges, has been included in earnings.
the impact of interest rate risk management activities on income in 2001,
2000 and 1999 was not material. the amount of deferred gains and losses from
interest rate risk management transactions at september 30, 2001 was not
material.
foreign exchange risk management
the company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated
with changing foreign exchange rates. the company's objective is to reduce
earnings and cash flow volatility associated with foreign exchange rate changes
to allow management to focus attention on core business issues and challenges.
by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum
percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures for periods not to
exceed five years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in
the value of the related exposures.
it is the company's policy to enter into foreign currency transactions only
to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above. the
company does not enter into foreign currency transactions for speculative
purposes.
the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign
exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency
assets and liabilities, commitments and forecasted foreign currency revenues.
the company uses option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the
sale of foreign currencies to hedge forecasted revenues. the company also uses
forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. while these
hedging instruments are subject to fluctuations in value, such fluctuations are
offset by changes in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged. the
principal currencies hedged are the european euro, british pound, japanese yen
and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to hedge foreign
currency-denominated borrowings.
gains and losses on contracts hedging forecasted foreign currency revenues
are recorded to aoci, and reclassified to current earnings when such revenues
are recognized, and offset changes in the value of the foreign currency
revenues. at september 30, 2001 and 2000, the company had deferred gains of $91
million and $24 million, respectively, and deferred losses of $24 million and
$7 million, respectively, related to foreign currency hedge transactions.
deferred amounts to be recognized can change with market conditions and will be
substantially offset by changes in the value of the related hedged
transactions. the impact of foreign exchange risk management activities on
operating income in 2001 and in 2000 was a net gain of $142 million and $195
million, respectively.

fair value of financial instruments
at september 30, 2001 and 2000, the company's financial instruments included
cash, cash equivalents, investments, receivables, accounts payable, borrowings
and interest rate, forward and foreign exchange risk management contracts.
at september 30, 2001 and 2000, the fair values of cash and cash
equivalents, receivables and accounts payable approximated carrying values
because of the short-term nature of these instruments. the estimated fair
values of other financial instruments subject to fair value disclosures,
determined based on broker quotes or quoted market prices or rates for the same
or similar instruments, and the related carrying amounts are as follows (in
millions):

credit concentrations
the company continually monitors its positions with, and the credit quality
of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial
instruments, and does not anticipate nonperformance by the counterparties. the
company would not realize a material loss as of september 30, 2001 in the event
of nonperformance by any one counterparty. the company enters into transactions
only with financial institution counterparties that have a credit rating of a-
or better. the company's current policy regarding agreements with financial
institution counterparties is generally to require collateral in the event
credit ratings fall below a- or in the event aggregate exposures exceed limits
as defined by contract. in addition, the company limits the amount of
investment credit exposure with any one institution.
the company's trade receivables and investments do not represent a
significant concentration of credit risk at september 30, 2001 due to the wide
variety of customers and markets into which the company's products are sold,
their dispersion across many geographic areas, and the diversification of the
company's portfolio among instruments and issuers.
13 commitments and contingencies
the company has various contractual commitments, including certain
guarantees, which are primarily for the purchase of broadcast rights for
various feature films, sports and other programming aggregating approximately
$13.4 billion as of september 30, 2001, including approximately $10.1 billion
related to sports programming rights, primarily nfl, college football and mlb.
this amount is substantially payable over the next five years.
-73-
the company has various real estate operating leases, including retail
outlets and distribution centers for consumer products and office space for
general and administrative purposes. future minimum lease payments under these
non-cancelable operating leases totaled $1.8 billion at september 30, 2001,
payable as follows (in millions):
2002       $239
2003        217
2004        190
2005        156
2006        184
thereafter  786
rental expense for the above operating leases during 2001, 2000 and 1999,
including common-area maintenance and contingent rentals, was $420 million,
$482 million and $385 million, respectively.
the company, together with, in some instances, certain of its directors and
officers, is a defendant or co-defendant in various legal actions involving
copyright, breach of contract and various other claims incident to the conduct
of its businesses.
all pro sports camps, inc., nicholas stracick and edward russell v. walt
disney company, walt disney world co., disney development company and steven b.
wilson. on january 8, 1997, the plaintiff entity and two of its principals or
former principals filed a lawsuit against the company, two of its subsidiaries
and a former employee in the circuit court for orange county, florida. the
plaintiffs asserted that the defendants had misappropriated from them the
concept used for the disney's wide world of sports complex at the walt disney
world resort. on august 11, 2000, a jury returned a verdict against the company
and its two subsidiaries in the amount of $240 million. subsequently, the court
awarded plaintiffs an additional $100.00 in exemplary damages based on
particular findings by the jury. the company has filed an appeal from the
judgment and believes that there are substantial grounds for complete reversal
or reduction of the verdict.
management believes that it is not currently possible to estimate the
impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have on the
company's results of operations, financial position or cash flows.
14 restructuring and impairment charges

total restructuring and impairment charges      $1,454 $  92 $172
====== ===== ====
-74-
in 2001, the company recorded restructuring and impairment charges totaling
$1.45 billion. the go.com charge is for the closure of the go.com portal
business and includes a non-cash write-off of intangible assets totaling $820
million (see note 2). the investment impairment charge is for
other-than-temporary declines in the fair value of certain internet
investments. the workforce reduction charges are primarily for severance costs
and are discussed more fully below. the disneyquest and disney store closure
charges are for the closure of the chicago facility and approximately 100
disney stores and includes the write-down of fixed assets and leasehold
improvements, leasehold termination costs, severance and other related closure
costs. the asset impairment charge is for certain long-lived assets, primarily
at the disney store and disney catalog. these assets were evaluated for
impairment under a held for use model due to declining cash flows. fair value
was generally determined based on discounted cash flows.
during the third quarter of fiscal 2001, the company initiated a plan to
eliminate 4,000 full-time jobs through a combination of voluntary and
involuntary reductions. the reduction affected employees in all business units
and geographic regions. the $111 million of costs associated with the workforce
reduction consist primarily of severance costs and write-offs of idled
facilities. as of september 30, 2001, the company had substantially completed
its workforce reduction and paid termination benefits totaling $92 million.
as of september 30, 2001, approximately $118 million of the restructuring
and impairment charges remained as an accrued liability on the balance sheet,
of which $19 million related to the workforce reduction and $21 million is from
prior-year restructuring charges. the majority of this amount is expected to be
paid in fiscal 2002.
in 2000, impairment charges amounted to $92 million, primarily related to
write-downs of certain internet investments and an asset impairment write-down
at toysmart.com in connection with its closure.
in 1999, the company recorded restructuring and impairment charges totaling
$172 million. the charges included $132 million for severance and other charges
and $40 million for long-lived asset impairments. the restructuring charges
included severance and lease and other contract cancellation costs, primarily
related to the consolidation of operations in the company's broadcasting,
television production and regional entertainment businesses as well as non-cash
charges for write-downs of underutilized assets.
15 subsequent event
on october 24, 2001, the company acquired 100% of the outstanding common
stock of fox family worldwide, inc. ("ffw") for $5.2 billion, including $2.9
billion in cash, plus the assumption of $2.3 billion in debt and preferred
stock. upon the closing of the acquisition, the company changed ffw's name to
abc family worldwide, inc. among the businesses acquired was the fox family
channel, which has been changed to the abc family channel, a programming
service that currently reaches approximately 81 million cable and satellite
television subscribers throughout the u.s.; a 76% interest in fox kids europe,
a dutch public subsidiary that reaches more than 24 million subscribers across
europe; fox kids channel in latin america and the saban library and
entertainment production businesses. under the terms of the agreement, the fox
kid's network, a block of children's programming broadcasted primarily by
fox-affiliated tv stations, and ongoing rights to use the "fox" name (other
than certain transitional rights) were not included in the acquired operations.
also in connection with the acquisition, the company acquired programming
commitments totaling approximately $1 billion, including approximately $675
million for certain mlb games through 2006.
-75-
the company's motivation for the acquisition was to increase shareholder
value. the company believes that it can reach this objective by improving the
programming of acquired cable channels through the use of new strategies,
including repurposing the programming of the abc television network, and by
reducing operating costs through consolidation.
the acquisition of ffw is being accounted for as a purchase, in accordance
with sfas 141. the company is in the process of identifying and valuing the
intangible assets of ffw by reporting unit. the allocation of the purchase
price has not yet been completed.
the following table summarizes ffw's carrying amounts for assets acquired
and liabilities assumed as of september 30, 2001, without adjustments for the
company's purchase accounting (in millions, unaudited).
