BASED ON NIELSEN MEDIA RESEARCH, U.S. TELEVISION HOUSEHOLD ESTIMATES, JANUARY 1, 2006

CABLE/SATELLITE NETWORKS AND INTERNATIONAL BROADCAST OPERATIONS

OUR CABLE/SATELLITE NETWORKS AND INTERNATIONAL BROADCAST OPERATIONS ARE PRINCIPALLY INVOLVED IN THE DISTRIBUTION OF TELEVISION PROGRAMMING, THE LICENSING OF PROGRAMMING TO DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND

INVESTING IN FOREIGN TELEVISION BROADCASTING, PRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION ENTITIES. THE CABLE NETWORKS PRODUCE THEIR OWN PROGRAMS OR ACQUIRE PROGRAMMING RIGHTS FROM OTHER PRODUCERS AND RIGHTS HOLDERS FOR NETWORK PROGRAMMING.

FEES. THE AMOUNTS THAT WE CAN CHARGE TO CABLE/SATELLITE SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR OUR CABLE NETWORK SERVICES ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON COMPETITION AND THE QUALITY AND QUANTITY OF PROGRAMMING THAT WE CAN PROVIDE. THE ABILITY TO SELL TIME FOR COMMERCIAL

ANNOUNCEMENTS AND THE RATES RECEIVED ARE PRIMARILY DEPENDENT ON THE SIZE AND NATURE OF THE AUDIENCE THAT THE NETWORK CAN DELIVER TO THE ADVERTISER AS WELL AS OVERALL ADVERTISER DEMAND.

INTERNET AND MOBILE OPERATIONS

THE INTERNET AND MOBILE OPERATIONS OF THE MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT DEVELOP, PUBLISH, AND DISTRIBUTE CONTENT FOR ONLINE AND WIRELESS SERVICES INTENDED TO APPEAL TO BROAD CONSUMER INTEREST IN SPORTS, NEWS, FAMILY, AND ENTERTAINMENT. INTERNET

WEB SITES AND PRODUCTS INCLUDE ABC.COM, ABCNEWS.COM, DISNEY.COM, AND ESPN.COM. THE COMPANYS INTERNET OPERATIONS DERIVE REVENUE FROM A COMBINATION OF ADVERTISING AND SPONSORSHIPS, SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES, AND E-COMMERCE ACTIVITIES.

ABC.COM IS THE OFFICIAL WEB SITE OF THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, WHILE ABCNEWS.COM DRAWS ON THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERTISE OF ABC NEWS CORRESPONDENTS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO PROVIDE IN-DEPTH NEWS COVERAGE ONLINE. ABCNEWS.COM ALSO OFFERS BROADBAND SUBSCRIPTIONS TO THE 24-HOUR LIVE INTERNET NEWS CHANNEL,

ABC NEWS NOW,

AND TO VIDEO-ON-DEMAND NEWS REPORTS FROM ALL ABC NEWS BROADCASTS. CONTENT

FROM ABC AND ABC NEWS IS ALSO AVAILABLE ON SELECT DOMESTIC CELLULAR CARRIER NETWORKS.

DISNEY.COM IS A CENTRALIZED DISNEY WEB SITE THAT

INTEGRATES MANY OF THE COMPANYS DISNEY-BRANDED INTERNET SITES INCLUDING SITES FOR THE DISNEY CHANNEL, PARKS AND RESORTS, AND WALT DISNEY PICTURES. DISNEY ONLINE OFFERS A NUMBER OF PREMIUM BROADBAND SERVICES, INCLUDING DISNEY CONNECTION AND

DISNEYS TOONTOWN ONLINE, AND DISNEY MOBILE STUDIOS PRODUCES AND PUBLISHES MOBILE CONTENT THAT IS DISTRIBUTED THROUGH MOBILE CARRIERS AND CONTENT DISTRIBUTORS WORLDWIDE. IN JUNE 2006, THE COMPANY LAUNCHED DISNEY MOBILE, A MOBILE PHONE SERVICE

SPECIFICALLY DEVELOPED TO MEET THE NEEDS OF PARENTS AND KIDS.

MILLIONS OF FANS EACH MONTH. ESPN360 IS A BROADBAND SERVICE THAT DELIVERS LIVE GAMES, HIGHLIGHTS, INSIDE ANALYSIS, AMONG OTHER CONTENT FEATURES. ESPN.COM AVERAGES 17.5 MILLION USERS PER MONTH.

IN FEBRUARY 2006, ESPN INTRODUCED MOBILE ESPN, THE FIRST NATIONAL U.S. WIRELESS PHONE SERVICE SPECIFICALLY TARGETED TO SPORTS FANS. IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED MOBILE ESPN WOULD BE TRANSITIONED INTO ITS EXISTING WIRELESS BUSINESS, WHICH DISTRIBUTES MOBILE CONTENT TO VARIOUS WIRELESS DEVICES.

COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY

THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, DISNEY CHANNEL, ESPN, ABC FAMILY CHANNEL, AND OUR OTHER BROADCAST

AND CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES COMPETE FOR VIEWERS PRIMARILY WITH OTHER TELEVISION NETWORKS, INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATIONS, AND OTHER VIDEO MEDIA, SUCH AS CABLE AND SATELLITE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING SERVICES, DVDS, VIDEO GAMES, AND THE INTERNET.

IN THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME, THE BROADCASTING OPERATIONS COMPETE WITH OTHER TELEVISION NETWORKS, INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATIONS, SUPPLIERS OF CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES, AND OTHER ADVERTISING MEDIA SUCH AS NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, BILLBOARDS,

AND THE INTERNET. THE RADIO NETWORKS LIKEWISE COMPETE WITH OTHER RADIO NETWORKS AND RADIO PROGRAMMING SERVICES, INDEPENDENT RADIO STATIONS, AND OTHER ADVERTISING MEDIA.

THE COMPANYS TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS COMPETE WITH OTHER TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS, CABLE AND SATELLITE PROGRAMMING SERVICES, DVDS AND OTHER ADVERTISING MEDIA SUCH AS NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, BILLBOARDS,

AND THE INTERNET. COMPETITION OCCURS PRIMARILY IN INDIVIDUAL MARKET AREAS. A TELEVISION OR RADIO STATION IN ONE MARKET GENERALLY DOES NOT COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH STATIONS IN OTHER MARKETS.

THE GROWTH IN THE CABLE AND SATELLITE INDUSTRYS SHARE OF VIEWERS HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FOR ADVERTISING REVENUES. THE

COMPANYS CABLE AND SATELLITE NETWORKS ALSO FACE COMPETITION FOR CARRIAGE BY CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICE OPERATORS AND DISTRIBUTORS. THE COMPANYS CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS ARE RENEWED OR RENEGOTIATED FROM

TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE CABLE AND SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS

FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS VARIOUS CABLE AND SATELLITE PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE.

-8-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANYS MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ALSO COMPETES FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SPORTS AND OTHER

PROGRAMMING. THE MARKET FOR PROGRAMMING IS VERY COMPETITIVE, PARTICULARLY FOR SPORTS PROGRAMMING. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS SPORTS RIGHTS AGREEMENTS WITH THE NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE (NFL), NATIONAL BASKETBALL ASSOCIATION (NBA), NASCAR, (BEGINNING

IN 2007) AND MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL (MLB), AS WELL AS FOR OTHER SPORTING EVENTS, INCLUDING VARIOUS COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL CONFERENCES, WORLD CUP, PGA TOUR, AND INDY RACING LEAGUE, INCLUDING THE INDIANAPOLIS 500.

THE COMPANYS INTERNET WEB SITES AND PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH OTHER WEB SITES AND PRODUCTS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CATEGORIES, WHICH INCLUDE KIDS, FAMILY,

ENTERTAINMENT, SPORTS, AND NEWS, AMONG OTHERS.

ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE MEDIA NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS.

REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL PROGRAMMING

COMMITMENTS ARE MET, AND THESE COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION DURING THIS PERIOD.

FEDERAL REGULATION

TELEVISION AND RADIO

BROADCASTING ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) UNDER FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. VIOLATION OF FCC REGULATIONS CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY

FORFEITURES, LIMITED RENEWALS OF LICENSES AND, IN EGREGIOUS CASES, DENIAL OF LICENSE RENEWAL OR REVOCATION OF A LICENSE. FCC REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



LICENSING OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS.

EACH OF THE TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE OWN MUST BE LICENSED BY THE FCC. THESE LICENSES ARE GRANTED FOR PERIODS OF UP TO

EIGHT YEARS, AND WE MUST OBTAIN RENEWAL OF LICENSES AS THEY EXPIRE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OPERATING THE STATIONS. WE (OR THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN THE CASE OF A DIVESTITURE) MUST ALSO OBTAIN FCC APPROVAL WHENEVER WE SEEK TO HAVE A LICENSE TRANSFERRED IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OR DIVESTITURE OF A STATION. THE FCC MAY DECLINE TO RENEW OR APPROVE THE TRANSFER OF A LICENSE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE GENERALLY RECEIVED SUCH RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE PAST, THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL ALWAYS OBTAIN NECESSARY RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE FUTURE.



TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP LIMITS.

THE FCC IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SPECIFIC MARKET, ON THE

COMBINED NUMBER OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SINGLE MARKET AND ON THE AGGREGATE PERCENTAGE OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE THAT CAN BE REACHED BY TELEVISION STATIONS WE OWN. CURRENTLY.



FCC REGULATIONS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN A MARKET, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND NATURE OF THE MARKET. WE DO NOT OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION

STATION IN ANY OF THE TEN MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN A TELEVISION STATION.



FEDERAL STATUTES PERMIT OUR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE AGGREGATE TO REACH A MAXIMUM OF 39% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE (FOR THIS PURPOSE, FCC REGULATIONS ATTRIBUTE TO UHF TELEVISION

STATIONS ONLY 50% OF THE TELEVISION HOUSEHOLDS IN THEIR MARKET). OUR STATIONS REACH APPROXIMATELY 24% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE (APPROXIMATELY 23% WHEN CALCULATED USING THE FCCS ATTRIBUTION RULES).



FCC REGULATIONS IN SOME CASES IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL RADIO OR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN RADIO STATIONS, BUT WE DO NOT

BELIEVE ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS ARE MATERIAL TO OUR CURRENT OPERATING PLANS.

IN JULY 2003, THE FCC ADOPTED REVISED LIMITS ON

TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP. THE RULES ADOPTED GENERALLY WOULD HAVE RELAXED EXISTING OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS AND PERMITTED ENTITIES TO OWN MORE TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS IN SOME MARKETS. THEY ALSO WOULD HAVE ELIMINATED THE 50% DISCOUNT

FOR CALCULATING HOUSEHOLDS REACHED BY UHF TELEVISION STATIONS OPERATED BY THE TOP FOUR BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS (INCLUDING ABC). THE NEW RULES, HOWEVER, WERE CHALLENGED IN FEDERAL COURT AND WERE REMANDED BY THE COURT TO THE FCC TO REVIEW THE

RULES. AS A

-9-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESULT, MOST OF THE REVISED RULES ADOPTED BY THE FCC IN JULY 2003 ARE NOT IN EFFECT. THIS YEAR, THE FCC INITIATED A RULEMAKING IN RESPONSE TO THE COURT

REMAND TO RE-EVALUATE THESE RULES IN LIGHT OF THE COURT DECISION. ALTHOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE FCC MAY IMPLEMENT MORE LIBERAL MEDIA OWNERSHIP RULES THAN THOSE CURRENTLY IN EFFECT (OTHER THAN THOSE GOVERNED BY STATUTE), WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER

THE REVISED RULES WILL BE IMPLEMENTED AND IF SO, WHEN SUCH RULES WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE.



DUAL NETWORKS.

FCC RULES CURRENTLY PROHIBIT ANY OF THE FOUR MAJOR TELEVISION NETWORKS  ABC, CBS, FOX AND NBC  FROM BEING UNDER COMMON OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.



REGULATION OF PROGRAMMING.

THE FCC REGULATES PROGRAMMING BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BANNING INDECENT PROGRAMMING, REGULATING POLITICAL ADVERTISING, AND IMPOSING

COMMERCIAL TIME LIMITS DURING CHILDRENS PROGRAMMING. BROADCASTERS FACE A HEIGHTENED RISK OF BEING FOUND IN VIOLATION OF THE INDECENCY PROHIBITION BY THE FCC BECAUSE OF RECENT FCC DECISIONS, COUPLED WITH THE SPONTANEITY OF LIVE PROGRAMMING.

RECENTLY, THE FCC HAS INDICATED THAT IT IS STEPPING UP ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AS THEY APPLY TO INDECENCY, AND HAS INDICATED IT WOULD CONSIDER LICENSE REVOCATION FOR SERIOUS VIOLATIONS. MOREOVER, LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN CONGRESS THAT WOULD

INCREASE PENALTIES FOR BROADCASTING INDECENT PROGRAMMING.

FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND FCC RULES ALSO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL MATTER THAT MAY BE SHOWN ON BROADCAST OR CABLE CHANNELS DURING PROGRAMMING DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN 12 YEARS OF

AGE AND YOUNGER. IN ADDITION, BROADCAST CHANNELS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF THREE HOURS PER WEEK OF PROGRAMMING THAT HAS AS A SIGNIFICANT PURPOSE MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN 16 YEARS OF

AGE AND YOUNGER. FCC RULES ALSO GIVE TELEVISION STATION OWNERS THE RIGHT TO REJECT OR REFUSE NETWORK PROGRAMMING IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO SUBSTITUTE PROGRAMMING THAT THE LICENSEE REASONABLY BELIEVES TO BE OF GREATER LOCAL OR NATIONAL

IMPORTANCE.



CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS.

WITH RESPECT TO CABLE SYSTEMS OPERATING WITHIN A TELEVISION STATIONS DESIGNATED MARKET AREA, FCC RULES

REQUIRE THAT EVERY THREE YEARS EACH TELEVISION STATION ELECT EITHER MUST CARRY STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH CABLE OPERATORS GENERALLY MUST CARRY A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION IN THE STATIONS MARKET, OR RETRANSMISSION CONSENT

STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE CABLE OPERATOR MUST NEGOTIATE WITH THE TELEVISION STATION TO OBTAIN THE CONSENT OF THE TELEVISION STATION PRIOR TO CARRYING ITS SIGNAL. UNDER THE SATELLITE HOME VIEWER IMPROVEMENT ACT AND ITS SUCCESSOR, THE SATELLITE

HOME VIEWER EXTENSION AND REAUTHORIZATION ACT, SATELLITE CARRIERS ARE PERMITTED TO RETRANSMIT A LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS SIGNAL INTO ITS LOCAL MARKET WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LOCAL TELEVISION STATION. IF A SATELLITE CARRIER ELECTS TO CARRY ONE

LOCAL STATION IN A MARKET, THE SATELLITE CARRIER MUST CARRY THE SIGNALS OF ALL LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS THAT ALSO REQUEST CARRIAGE. CERTAIN OF THE SATELLITE CARRIAGE PROVISIONS ARE SET TO EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 31, 2009.



DIGITAL TELEVISION.

FCC RULES CURRENTLY REQUIRE FULL-POWER ANALOG TELEVISION STATIONS, SUCH AS OURS, TO PROVIDE DIGITAL SERVICE ON A SECOND BROADCAST CHANNEL GRANTED

SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PHASE-IN OF DIGITAL BROADCASTING. FCC RULES ALSO REGULATE DIGITAL BROADCASTING TO ENSURE CONTINUED QUALITY CARRIAGE OF MANDATED FREE OVER-THE-AIR PROGRAM SERVICE. ALL OF THE COMPANYS STATIONS HAVE LAUNCHED DIGITAL

FACILITIES, AND WE ARE EVALUATING VARIOUS OPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO USE OF DIGITAL CHANNELS. UNDER A RECENTLY-ENACTED STATUTE, ALL BROADCASTERS ARE REQUIRED TO OPERATE EXCLUSIVELY IN DIGITAL MODE AND PERMANENTLY SURRENDER ONE OF THEIR TWO CHANNELS BY

FEBRUARY 17, 2009.

THE FOREGOING IS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND OTHER

LEGISLATION AND OF SPECIFIC FCC RULES AND POLICIES. THIS SUMMARY FOCUSES ON PROVISIONS MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE TO THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT, OTHER LEGISLATION, FCC RULES AND PUBLIC NOTICES AND RULINGS OF THE FCC FOR FURTHER

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FCCS REGULATORY AUTHORITY.

FCC LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND

THE COMPANY GENERALLY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER NEW LEGISLATION, COURT ACTION OR REGULATIONS, OR A CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OF APPLICATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF CURRENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS.

COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY

THE COMPANYS THEME PARKS AND RESORTS COMPETE WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM, AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. THE PROFITABILITY OF THE LEISURE-TIME INDUSTRY MAY BE INFLUENCED BY VARIOUS

FACTORS THAT ARE NOT DIRECTLY CONTROLLABLE, SUCH AS ECONOMIC CONDITIONS INCLUDING BUSINESS CYCLE AND EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, TRAVEL INDUSTRY TRENDS, AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE LEISURE TIME, OIL AND TRANSPORTATION PRICES, AND WEATHER PATTERNS.

ALL OF THE THEME PARKS AND THE ASSOCIATED RESORT FACILITIES ARE OPERATED ON A YEAR-ROUND BASIS. HISTORICALLY, THE THEME PARKS AND RESORT

BUSINESS EXPERIENCES FLUCTUATIONS IN THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY RESULTING FROM THE SEASONAL NATURE OF VACATION TRAVEL AND LOCAL ENTERTAINMENT EXCURSIONS. PEAK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY GENERALLY OCCUR DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS

WHEN SCHOOL VACATIONS OCCUR AND DURING EARLY-WINTER AND SPRING-HOLIDAY PERIODS.

THEATRICAL RELEASE OF A FILM IN AN EFFORT TO GENERATE PUBLIC AWARENESS OF THE FILM, TO INCREASE THE PUBLICS INTENT TO VIEW THE FILM, AND TO HELP GENERATE SIGNIFICANT CONSUMER INTEREST IN THE SUBSEQUENT HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND OTHER ANCILLARY

MARKETS. THESE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED, THEREFORE, WE TYPICALLY INCUR LOSSES IN THE THEATRICAL MARKETS ON A FILM, INCLUDING THE QUARTERS BEFORE THE THEATRICAL RELEASE OF THE FILM.

COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY

THE SUCCESS OF STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT OPERATIONS IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON PUBLIC TASTE AND PREFERENCES. IN ADDITION, STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE

THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT, AND TELEVISION MARKETS. RELEASE DATES ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS.

THE STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH ALL FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPANIES PRODUCE AND/OR DISTRIBUTE THEATRICAL AND

TELEVISION FILMS, EXPLOIT PRODUCTS IN THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET, PROVIDE PAY TELEVISION PROGRAMMING SERVICES, AND SPONSOR LIVE THEATER. WE ALSO COMPETE TO OBTAIN CREATIVE AND PERFORMING TALENTS, STORY PROPERTIES, ADVERTISER SUPPORT, BROADCAST

RIGHTS, AND MARKET SHARE, THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES.

COMPETITION AND SEASONALITY

THE COMPANY COMPETES IN

ITS CHARACTER MERCHANDISING AND OTHER LICENSING, PUBLISHING, INTERACTIVE, AND RETAIL ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER LICENSORS, PUBLISHERS, AND RETAILERS OF CHARACTER, BRAND, AND CELEBRITY NAMES. BASED ON INDEPENDENT SURVEYS, WE BELIEVE THE COMPANY IS THE

LARGEST WORLDWIDE LICENSOR OF CHARACTER-BASED MERCHANDISE AND PRODUCER/DISTRIBUTOR OF CHILDRENS FILM-RELATED PRODUCTS BASED ON RETAIL SALES. OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE LICENSING AND RETAIL DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL

CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF ANIMATED THEATRICAL RELEASES.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION

THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES ARE AFFECTED BY ITS ABILITY THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO EXPLOIT AND PROTECT AGAINST INFRINGEMENT OF ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,

INCLUDING TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS, AND TRADE SECRETS. IMPORTANT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INCLUDES RIGHTS IN THE CONTENT OF MOTION PICTURES, TELEVISION PROGRAMS, ELECTRONIC GAMES, SOUND RECORDINGS, CHARACTER LIKENESSES, THEME PARK

ATTRACTIONS, BOOKS, AND MAGAZINES.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO EXPLOIT AND PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS AFFECTED BY THE

STRENGTH AND EFFECTIVENESS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. INADEQUATE LAWS OR ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN A COUNTRY CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS,

DESPITE THE COMPANYS STRONG EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. IN ADDITION, A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, SUCH AS PEER-TO-PEER TECHNOLOGY AND SOME FEATURES OF DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDERS HAVE MADE

INFRINGEMENT EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT MORE CHALLENGING. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO PROTECTING ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED USE IN THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN MARKETS.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF CHALLENGES BY THIRD PARTIES CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT OF THEIR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR VALIDITY,

SUCH CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERSION OF RESOURCES WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

FOR AN ENTERPRISE AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS THE COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS

COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS AFFECTING SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPERATIONS IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THESE OPERATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS ELSEWHERE

IN THIS REPORT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

CHANGES IN U.S., GLOBAL, OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

A DECREASE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES OR IN OTHER

REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, THUS REDUCING OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS. A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD REDUCE ATTENDANCE AND SPENDING AT ONE OR MORE OF OUR PARKS AND

RESORTS, PURCHASE OF OR PRICES FOR ADVERTISING ON OUR BROADCAST OR CABLE NETWORKS OR OWNED STATIONS, PRICES THAT CABLE OPERATORS WILL PAY FOR OUR CABLE PROGRAMMING, PERFORMANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT RELEASES, AND PURCHASES OF

COMPANY-LICENSED CONSUMER PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN PRICE LEVELS GENERALLY, OR IN PRICE LEVELS IN A PARTICULAR SECTOR SUCH AS THE ENERGY SECTOR, COULD RESULT IN A SHIFT IN CONSUMER DEMAND AWAY FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS

WE OFFER, WHICH COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASE OUR COSTS. CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY REDUCE INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCREASE OUR LABOR OR SUPPLY COSTS IN NON-UNITED

STATES MARKETS, OR REDUCE THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR VALUE OF REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER MARKETS.

CHANGES IN PUBLIC AND CONSUMER TASTES AND

PREFERENCES FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS AND REDUCE PROFITABILITY.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES CREATES ENTERTAINMENT OR CONSUMER PRODUCTS WHOSE SUCCESS DEPENDS SUBSTANTIALLY ON CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES THAT CHANGE IN OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO

CONSISTENTLY CREATE AND DISTRIBUTE FILMED ENTERTAINMENT, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, RESORT FACILITIES, AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE CHANGING PREFERENCES OF THE BROAD CONSUMER MARKET. MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES

INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON WORLDWIDE ACCEPTANCE OF OUR OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS, AND THEIR SUCCESS THEREFORE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT AND ADAPT TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES OUTSIDE AS WELL AS INSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

MOREOVER, WE MUST OFTEN INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN FILM PRODUCTION, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, OR RESORT FACILITIES BEFORE WE LEARN THE EXTENT TO WHICH PRODUCTS WILL EARN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. IF OUR ENTERTAINMENT

OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, OUR REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING SALES (WHICH ARE BASED IN PART ON RATINGS FOR THE PROGRAMS IN WHICH ADVERTISEMENTS AIR) OR SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, FROM

THEATRICAL FILM RECEIPTS OR HOME VIDEO SALES, FROM THEME PARK ADMISSIONS AND RESORT ROOM, FOOD, AND BEVERAGE CHARGES, FROM SALES OF LICENSED CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR FROM SALES OF OUR OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES MAY DECLINE AND ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES.

CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND IN CONSUMER CONSUMPTION PATTERNS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR

ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS OR THE COST OF PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTS.

THE MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE

PARTICIPATE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE, DEVELOP, ADOPT AND EXPLOIT NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO DISTINGUISH OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGIES AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THE

TIME AND MANNER IN WHICH CONSUMERS ACQUIRE AND VIEW SOME OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO ADVERTISERS FOR REACHING THEIR DESIRED MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE.



THE SUCCESS OF OUR OFFERINGS IN THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET DEPENDS IN PART ON CONSUMER PREFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO HOME ENTERTAINMENT FORMATS, INCLUDING DVD PLAYERS AND PERSONAL

VIDEO RECORDERS, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE HOME ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING WEB-BASED DELIVERY OF ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS;

-20-

TABLE OF CONTENTS



TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OFFER CONSUMERS AN EXPANDING ARRAY OF ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS AND IF CONSUMERS FAVOR OPTIONS WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED RATHER THAN THE ENTERTAINMENT

PRODUCTS WE OFFER, OUR SALES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF

PROTECTING THESE RIGHTS OR REDUCE OUR REVENUES.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON MAINTENANCE OF INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE CREATE. NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS PEER-TO-PEER TECHNOLOGY, HIGH SPEED DIGITAL TRANSMISSION (INCLUDING DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION OF THEATRICAL FILMS) AND SOME FEATURES OF DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDERS

HAVE MADE INFRINGEMENT OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN FILMS AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MORE CHALLENGING. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT UNAUTHORIZED USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN

THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY GENERALLY IS A SIGNIFICANT AND RAPIDLY GROWING PHENOMENON. THESE DEVELOPMENTS REQUIRE US TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED USE AND PRESENT THE RISK OF INCREASED

LOSSES OF REVENUE AS A RESULT OF SALES OF UNAUTHORIZED PRODUCTS.

A VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR

IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OR INCREASE THE COST OF PROVIDING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

PARTICULARLY OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS, IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM. THE ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM, AS WELL AS DEMAND FOR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN

THE UNITED STATES, GLOBALLY OR IN SPECIFIC REGIONS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING: ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS OR NATURAL DISASTERS (SUCH AS EXCESSIVE HEAT OR RAIN, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES); HEALTH CONCERNS;

INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL OR MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS; AND TERRORIST ATTACKS. THESE EVENTS, AND OTHERS SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN TRAVEL AND ENERGY COSTS AND COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACKS OR OTHER WIDESPREAD COMPUTING OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, MAY ALSO

DAMAGE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THESE EVENTS. DUE TO RECENT WEATHER EVENTS, WE ARE CURRENTLY LIMITED IN THE EXTENT OF INSURANCE WE CAN OBTAIN FOR WIND DAMAGE AND ARE CARRYING

MORE SELF-INSURANCE WITH RESPECT TO THIS RISK THAN WE HAVE IN THE PAST.

SUSTAINED INCREASES IN COSTS OF PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL AND OTHER

EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

WITH MORE THAN 133,000 EMPLOYEES, OUR PROFITABILITY IS

SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED BY COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS AND CURRENT AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. IN RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THESE COSTS AS A RESULT OF MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING

INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN INVESTMENT RETURNS AND DISCOUNT RATES USED TO CALCULATE PENSION AND RELATED LIABILITIES MAY AFFECT OUR COSTS IN SOME YEARS. AT LEAST SOME OF THESE MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS MAY CONTINUE TO PUT

UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING PENSION AND MEDICAL BENEFITS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE

COULD REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS OR

OTHERWISE AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OCCUR WE MAY NEED TO ADJUST OUR BUSINESS

STRATEGIES TO MEET THESE CHANGES OR WE MAY OTHERWISE FIND IT NECESSARY TO RESTRUCTURE OUR OPERATIONS OR PARTICULAR BUSINESSES OR ASSETS. IN ADDITION, EXTERNAL EVENTS INCLUDING ACCEPTANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL OFFERINGS AND CHANGES IN MACRO-ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS MAY IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS. WHEN THESE CHANGES OR EVENTS OCCUR, WE MAY INCUR COSTS TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND MAY NEED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF ASSETS. WE MAY ALSO NEED TO INVEST IN NEW BUSINESSES THAT HAVE SHORT-TERM

RETURNS THAT ARE NEGATIVE OR LOW AND WHOSE ULTIMATE BUSINESS PROSPECTS ARE UNCERTAIN. IN ANY OF THESE EVENTS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE, WE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS OR RETURNS ON NEW INVESTMENTS MAY BE LOWER

THAN PRIOR TO THE CHANGE IN STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING.

PREVIOUSLY ISSUED VESTED AND UNVESTED PIXAR EQUITY-BASED AWARDS INTO APPROXIMATELY 45 MILLION DISNEY EQUITY-BASED AWARDS.

THE

TRANSACTION RESULTED IN LOWER EARNINGS PER SHARE IN FISCAL 2006 THAN WOULD HAVE BEEN EARNED BY THE COMPANY IN THE ABSENCE OF THE TRANSACTION AND THIS DILUTION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE IN FISCAL 2007 AND POSSIBLY IN FUTURE YEARS. IN ADDITION, THE

ISSUANCE OF SHARES IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION HAS DECREASED THE AGGREGATE VOTING POWER OF THE COMPANYS PRE-TRANSACTION SHAREHOLDERS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT OVER TIME THE TRANSACTION WILL YIELD BENEFITS TO THE COMPANY SUCH THAT THE

TRANSACTION WILL ULTIMATELY BE ACCRETIVE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS PER SHARE EXPECTED IN THE LONGER TERM WILL BE ACHIEVED. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE INCREASES IN EARNINGS PER SHARE AS A RESULT

OF THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY WILL, AMONG OTHER THINGS, NEED TO EFFECTIVELY CONTINUE THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS OF PIXAR AFTER THE ACQUISITION, DEVELOP SUCCESSFUL SEQUELS TO PRIOR PIXAR PRODUCTIONS, AND IMPROVE THE OVERALL PERFORMANCE OF THE DISNEY

FEATURE ANIMATION BUSINESS.

MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS MAY IMPEDE ACCESS TO OR INCREASE THE COST OF FINANCING OUR OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS.

CHANGES IN U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND EQUITY MARKETS, INCLUDING MARKET DISRUPTIONS AND SIGNIFICANT INTEREST RATE FLUCTUATIONS, MAY

MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS OR INCREASE THE COST OF OBTAINING FINANCING. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING

AGENCIES WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. A DECREASE IN THESE RATINGS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT

FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING.

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES FROM ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER AND FROM OTHER FORMS OF

ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO MUST COMPETE TO OBTAIN HUMAN RESOURCES, PROGRAMMING AND OTHER RESOURCES WE REQUIRE IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND STATIONS COMPETE FOR VIEWERS WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES AS WELL AS WITH HOME VIDEO PRODUCTS AND INTERNET USAGE.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND STATIONS COMPETE FOR THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES, AS WELL AS NEWSPAPER, MAGAZINES,

BILLBOARDS AND THE INTERNET.



OUR CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR CARRIAGE OF THEIR PROGRAMMING WITH OTHER PROGRAMMING PROVIDERS.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CREATIVE TALENT AND SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING WITH OTHER BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS.



OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS COMPETE FOR GUESTS WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATION ACTIVITIES.



OUR STUDIO OPERATIONS COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT.



OUR STUDIO OPERATIONS, BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND PUBLISHING BUSINESSES COMPETE TO OBTAIN CREATIVE AND PERFORMING TALENT, STORY PROPERTIES, ADVERTISER SUPPORT, BROADCAST

RIGHTS AND MARKET SHARE.



OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT COMPETES IN THE CHARACTER MERCHANDISING AND OTHER LICENSING, PUBLISHING, INTERACTIVE AND RETAIL ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER LICENSORS, PUBLISHERS AND

RETAILERS OF CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES.

-22-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITION IN EACH OF THESE AREAS MAY DIVERT CONSUMERS FROM OUR CREATIVE OR OTHER PRODUCTS, OR TO OTHER

PRODUCTS OR OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR MARKETING COSTS. COMPETITION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF RESOURCES CAN INCREASE THE COST OF PRODUCING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

OUR RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF LONG-TERM PROGRAMMING OR CARRIAGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT RENEWED ON SUFFICIENTLY FAVORABLE TERMS.

WE ENTER INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR BOTH THE ACQUISITION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTS FOR THE

ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS FOR SPORTING EVENTS AND OTHER PROGRAMS, AND CONTRACTS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PROGRAMMING TO CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS. AS THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRE, WE MUST RENEW OR RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS, AND IF WE ARE

UNABLE TO RENEW THEM ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY LOSE PROGRAMMING RIGHTS OR DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS. EVEN IF THESE CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED, THE COST OF OBTAINING PROGRAMMING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE (OR INCREASE AT FASTER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE)

OR THE REVENUE FROM DISTRIBUTION OF PROGRAMS MAY BE REDUCED (OR INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE). WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, THE IMPACT OF THESE LONG-TERM

CONTRACTS ON OUR RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT REVENUES FROM

PROGRAMMING BASED ON THESE RIGHTS WILL EXCEED THE COST OF THE RIGHTS PLUS THE OTHER COSTS OF PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAMMING.

CHANGES IN

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES MAY IMPAIR THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BROADCAST NETWORKS AND TELEVISION

STATIONS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED, AND EACH OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF UNITED STATES AND OVERSEAS REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATIONS INCLUDE.



UNITED STATES FCC REGULATION OF OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO NETWORKS AND OWNED STATIONS, INCLUDING LICENSING OF STATIONS, OWNERSHIP LIMITS, PROHIBITIONS ON INDECENT

PROGRAMMING AND RESTRICTIONS ON COMMERCIAL TIME IN CHILDRENS PROGRAMMING AND REGULATION OF OUR BROADCASTING BUSINESSES IN NON-UNITED STATES MARKETS. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING FCC REGULATION IS PROVIDED IN ITEM 1  BUSINESS

 MEDIA NETWORKS, FEDERAL REGULATION.



ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION REGULATIONS.



FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS.



REGULATION OF THE SAFETY OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND THEME PARK OPERATIONS.



IMPOSITION BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES OF TRADE RESTRICTIONS OR MOTION PICTURE OR TELEVISION CONTENT REQUIREMENTS OR QUOTAS.



DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TAX LAWS OR CURRENCY CONTROLS.

CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE REGULATORY AREAS MAY REQUIRE US TO SPEND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS, OR MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE PROFITABLE.

LABOR DISPUTES MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND IMPAIR OUR PROFITABILITY.

A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN VARIOUS OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS AS WELL AS WRITERS, DIRECTORS, ACTORS, PRODUCTION

PERSONNEL AND OTHERS EMPLOYED IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS AND STUDIO OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE EMPLOYEES OF LICENSEES WHO MANUFACTURE AND RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS MAY BE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE LABOR AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS. A

LABOR DISPUTE INVOLVING OUR EMPLOYEES OR THE EMPLOYEES OF OUR LICENSEES OR RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUES, AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES WITH OUR EMPLOYEES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROVISIONS IN OUR CORPORATE DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE STATE LAW COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL, EVEN IF THAT

CHANGE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO SHAREHOLDERS.

OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION CONTAINS A PROVISION REGULATING THE ABILITY OF

SHAREHOLDERS TO BRING MATTERS FOR ACTION BEFORE ANNUAL AND SPECIAL MEETINGS AND AUTHORIZES OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE AND SET THE TERMS OF PREFERRED STOCK. THE REGULATIONS ON SHAREHOLDER ACTION COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ANY PERSON

SEEKING TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF ACTIONS THAT WOULD SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD EFFECTIVELY DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF ANY PERSON SEEKING CONTROL OR OTHERWISE MAKE IT MORE

DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN CONTROL. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, WHICH COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE OF CONTROL IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE SEASONALITY OF CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES COULD EXACERBATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES IS NORMALLY SUBJECT TO SEASONAL VARIATIONS, AS FOLLOWS.



REVENUES IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ARE INFLUENCED BY ADVERTISER DEMAND AND THE SEASONAL NATURE OF PROGRAMMING, AND AUDIENCE VIEWERSHIP GENERALLY PEAKS IN THE WINTER MONTHS.



REVENUES IN OUR PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY RESULTING FROM THE SEASONAL NATURE OF VACATION TRAVEL. PEAK ATTENDANCE

AND RESORT OCCUPANCY GENERALLY OCCUR DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS, WHEN SCHOOL VACATIONS OCCUR, AND DURING EARLY-WINTER AND SPRING HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE TIMING OF THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE, HOME ENTERTAINMENT, AND TELEVISION RELEASES. RELEASE DATES FOR THEATRICAL,

HOME ENTERTAINMENT, AND TELEVISION PRODUCTS ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS AND COMPETITION IN THE MARKET.



REVENUES IN OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AND THE TIMING OF ANIMATED THEATRICAL RELEASES AND GENERALLY PEAK IN OUR FIRST

FISCAL QUARTER DUE TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON.

ACCORDINGLY, IF A SHORT TERM NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OCCURS DURING A TIME

OF HIGH SEASONAL DEMAND (SUCH AS HURRICANE DAMAGE TO OUR PARKS DURING THE SUMMER TRAVEL SEASON), THE EFFECT COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF THAT BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR.

ITEM 1B. UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

MILNE AND DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. V. STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC.

ON

NOVEMBER 5, 2002, CLARE MILNE, THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A. A. MILNE, AUTHOR OF THE WINNIE THE POOH BOOKS, AND THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. (DEI) FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. (SSI) IN THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2002, MS. MILNE SERVED NOTICES TO SSI AND DEI TERMINATING A. A. MILNES PRIOR GRANT OF RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004, AND GRANTED

ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS TO DEI. IN THEIR LAWSUIT, MS. MILNE AND DEI SOUGHT A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, UNDER UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT LAW, THAT MS. MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE VALID; THAT SSIS RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH IN THE UNITED

STATES TERMINATED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004; THAT UPON TERMINATION OF SSIS RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY LAWSUIT TERMINATED BY

OPERATION OF LAW; AND THAT, AS OF NOVEMBER 5, 2004, SSI WAS ENTITLED TO NO FURTHER ROYALTIES FOR USES OF WINNIE THE POOH. SSI FILED (A) AN ANSWER DENYING THE MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT AND (B) COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING A

DECLARATION THAT (I) MS. MILNES GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI IS VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE AND (II) DEI REMAINS OBLIGATED TO PAY SSI ROYALTIES UNDER THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT. THE DISTRICT COURT RULED THAT MILNES TERMINATION

NOTICES WERE INVALID. THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED, AND ON JUNE 26, 2006, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DENIED MILNES PETITION FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI. ON JUNE 23, 2003, SSI FILED AN AMENDED ANSWER AND

COUNTERCLAIMS AND A THIRD-PARTY COMPLAINT AGAINST HARRIET HUNT (HEIR TO E. H. SHEPARD, ILLUSTRATOR OF THE ORIGINAL WINNIE THE POOH STORIES), WHO HAD SERVED A NOTICE OF TERMINATION AND A GRANT OF RIGHTS SIMILAR TO MS. MILNES, AND ASSERTED

COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE MILNE AND HUNT TERMINATIONS AND THE GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI FOR (A) UNLAWFUL AND UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES; AND (B) BREACH OF THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT.

ON OCTOBER 19, 2006, THE PARTIES STIPULATED TO SSIS FILING ITS FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS (FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER) SEEKING

(A) TO INVALIDATE THE HUNT TERMINATION NOTICE, (B) TO TERMINATE THE COMPANYS RIGHTS VIS-À-VIS SSI, AND (C) DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS, AMONG OTHER RELIEF. THAT STIPULATION ALSO PROVIDED THAT HUNT AND THE

COMPANY NEED NOT RESPOND TO THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF TWO EVENTS: THE STATE COURT APPEAL IN

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY,

AND THE TRIAL IN THE DISTRICT COURT ON THE VALIDITY OF THE HUNT

TERMINATION NOTICE. SSI THEN SOUGHT TO WITHDRAW BOTH THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND ITS STIPULATION, BUT ON NOVEMBER 3, 2006, THE COURT DENIED THAT REQUEST AND ORDERED THAT THE HUNT TERMINATION TRIAL COMMENCE ON MARCH 20, 2007.

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

. IN THIS LAWSUIT, FILED ON FEBRUARY 27, 1991 IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT,

THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT A COMPANY SUBSIDIARY DEFRAUDED IT AND BREACHED A 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH PROPERTIES, BY FAILING TO ACCOUNT FOR AND PAY ROYALTIES ON REVENUES EARNED FROM THE SALE OF WINNIE THE POOH

MOVIES ON VIDEOCASSETTE AND FROM THE EXPLOITATION OF WINNIE THE POOH MERCHANDISING RIGHTS. THE PLAINTIFF SEEKS DAMAGES FOR THE LICENSEES ALLEGED BREACHES AS WELL AS CONFIRMATION OF THE PLAINTIFFS INTERPRETATION OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT

WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE ACTIVITIES. THE PLAINTIFF ALSO SEEKS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT ON THE BASIS OF THE ALLEGED BREACHES. IF EACH OF THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS WERE TO BE CONFIRMED IN A FINAL JUDGMENT, DAMAGES AS ARGUED BY THE

PLAINTIFF COULD TOTAL AS MUCH AS SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE TO THE COMPANY OF ANY FUTURE EXPLOITATION OF THE LICENSED RIGHTS. ON MARCH 29, 2004, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION FOR TERMINATING

SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF FOR A HOST OF DISCOVERY ABUSES, INCLUDING THE WITHHOLDING, ALTERATION, AND THEFT OF DOCUMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION, AND, ON APRIL 5, 2004, DISMISSED PLAINTIFFS CASE WITH PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS

SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS TO DISQUALIFY THE JUDGE WHO GRANTED THE TERMINATING SANCTIONS WERE DENIED IN 2004, AND ITS MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL WAS DENIED ON JANUARY 26, 2005, ALLOWING PLAINTIFF TO PROCEED WITH ITS NOTICED APPEAL FROM THE

APRIL 5, 2004, ORDER OF DISMISSAL. ARGUMENT OF THE APPEAL HAS NOT BEEN SCHEDULED.

IN RE PIXAR SECURITIES LITIGATION

. ON

OCTOBER 21, 2005, A PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT WAS FILED AGAINST PIXAR, STEVEN P. JOBS, EDWIN E. CATMULL AND SIMON T. BAX IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. IN THIS CASE, TOGETHER WITH

THREE SUBSEQUENT CASES WHICH HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED, PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS ISSUED FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS IN CERTAIN OF PIXARS PRESS RELEASES AND SEC FILINGS BETWEEN JANUARY 18, 2005 AND JUNE 30, 2005,

CONCERNING EARNINGS PIXAR EXPECTED TO RECEIVE FOR ITS SECOND FISCAL QUARTER OF 2005, ENDED JULY 2, 2005, FROM THE HOME VIDEO SALES OF THE INCREDIBLES. PLAINTIFFS ASSERT CLAIMS UNDER SECTION 10(B) AND 20(A) OF THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE

ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED, AND RULE 10B-5 PROMULGATED THEREUNDER. ON

-26-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

JUNE 29, 2006, DEFENDANTS FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT, WHICH WAS GRANTED BY ORDER DATED SEPTEMBER 12, 2006. WHILE THE ORDER

ALLOWED PLAINTIFFS 30 DAYS TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT, PLAINTIFFS AGREED NOT TO DO SO, AND THE LAWSUIT WAS DISMISSED ON OCTOBER 20, 2006, BY STIPULATION OF THE PARTIES.

IN RE THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY DERIVATIVE LITIGATION

. WILLIAM AND GERALDINE BREHM AND THIRTEEN OTHER INDIVIDUALS FILED AN AMENDED AND CONSOLIDATED

COMPLAINT ON MAY 28, 1997 IN THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY SEEKING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT AGAINST EACH OF THE COMPANYS DIRECTORS AS OF DECEMBER 1996 THAT THE COMPANYS 1995 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT WITH ITS FORMER

PRESIDENT MICHAEL S. OVITZ, WAS VOID, OR ALTERNATIVELY THAT MR. OVITZS TERMINATION SHOULD BE DEEMED A TERMINATION FOR CAUSE AND ANY SEVERANCE PAYMENTS TO HIM FORFEITED. ON OCTOBER 8, 1998, THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY

DISMISSED ALL COUNTS OF THE AMENDED COMPLAINT. PLAINTIFFS APPEALED, AND ON FEBRUARY 9, 2000, THE SUPREME COURT OF DELAWARE AFFIRMED THE DISMISSAL BUT RULED ALSO THAT PLAINTIFFS SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE COURTS OPINION. THE PLAINTIFFS FILED THEIR AMENDED COMPLAINT ON JANUARY 3, 2002. ON FEBRUARY 6, 2003, THE COMPANYS DIRECTORS MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS CONVERTED BY THE COURT TO A MOTION FOR SUMMARY

JUDGMENT AND THE PLAINTIFFS WERE PERMITTED TO TAKE DISCOVERY. THE COMPANY AND ITS DIRECTORS ANSWERED THE AMENDED COMPLAINT ON APRIL 1, 2003. ON MAY 28, 2003, THE COURT (TREATING AS A MOTION TO DISMISS THE MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT INTO

WHICH IT HAD CONVERTED THE ORIGINAL MOTION ON FEBRUARY 6, 2003) DENIED THE DIRECTORS MOTION TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT. AFTER TRIAL, ON AUGUST 9, 2005, THE DELAWARE COURT OF CHANCERY ISSUED AN ORDER ENTERING JUDGMENT AGAINST

THE PLAINTIFFS AND IN FAVOR OF ALL DEFENDANTS ON ALL COUNTS, WHICH JUDGMENT WAS AFFIRMED ON JUNE 8, 2006, BY THE DELAWARE SUPREME COURT.

SIMILAR OR IDENTICAL CLAIMS WERE ASSERTED IN COMPLAINTS FILED BY THE SAME PLAINTIFFS (OTHER THAN WILLIAM AND GERALDINE BREHM, JAMES C. HAYS AND BARNETT STEPAK) IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES COUNTY ON AND

AFTER JANUARY 3, 1997. THOSE CASES WERE DISMISSED ON NOVEMBER 28, 2005.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE TO

ESTIMATE THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF PENDING MATTERS NOTED ABOVE WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES, CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR CO-DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS

INVOLVING COPYRIGHT, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE COMPANY TO SUFFER ANY MATERIAL LIABILITY BY REASON OF SUCH ACTIONS.

2006 VS. 2005

REVENUES FOR THE YEAR INCREASED 7%,

OR $2.3 BILLION, TO $34.3 BILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FOLLOWING.



THE PERFORMANCE AT OUR DOMESTIC THEME PARKS, LED BY THE SUCCESS OF THE 50

TH

ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION OF DISNEYLAND;



THE STRONG BOX-OFFICE PERFORMANCE OF

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MANS CHEST, THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE,

AND DISNEY/PIXARS

CARS;



HIGHER AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES;



ADVERTISING REVENUE GROWTH AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK;



INCREASED SALES OF TOUCHSTONE TELEVISION SERIES; AND



THE FIRST FULL YEAR OF THEME PARK OPERATIONS AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WHEN THE PARK OPENED IN MID-SEPTEMBER 2005.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN DVD UNIT SALES AT HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND FEWER DOMESTIC MIRAMAX THEATRICAL RELEASES IN THE CURRENT

YEAR.

NET INCOME INCREASED 33%, OR $841 MILLION, TO $3.4 BILLION DUE TO LOWER DISTRIBUTION COSTS RESULTING FROM FEWER MIRAMAX THEATRICAL

RELEASES, IMPROVED MARGINS AT WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT DRIVEN BY REDUCED MARKETING AND TRADE PROGRAMS AND LOWER DISTRIBUTION COSTS, THE STRONG PERFORMANCE AT BOTH OF OUR DOMESTIC THEME PARKS, GROWTH AT ESPN, AND IMPROVED PRIMETIME RESULTS AT THE

ABC TELEVISION NETWORK. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE YEAR INCREASED 34%, OR $0.42, TO $1.64, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.22.

REVENUES

FOR FISCAL 2005 INCREASED 4%, OR $1.2 BILLION, TO $31.9 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES WAS DUE TO GROWTH AT MEDIA NETWORKS AND PARKS AND RESORTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT. THE MEDIA NETWORKS GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY

HIGHER AFFILIATE FEES AT CABLE NETWORKS AND HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUES. THE INCREASE AT PARKS AND RESORTS WAS DUE TO AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF EURO DISNEY REVENUES IN FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004 AS EURO DISNEYS RESULTS WERE

CONSOLIDATED BEGINNING IN MID FISCAL 2004 AND HIGHER OCCUPIED ROOM NIGHTS, THEME PARK ATTENDANCE, AND GUEST SPENDING AT THE DOMESTIC RESORTS. THE DECLINE AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN OVERALL DECLINE IN DVD UNIT SALES.

NET INCOME FOR THE YEAR INCREASED 8%, OR $188 MILLION, TO $2.5 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH AT MEDIA NETWORKS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT. ADDITIONALLY, WE ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123R,

SHARE

(SFAS 123R), INCREASING EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR BY $253 MILLION ($160 MILLION

AFTER-TAX OR $0.08 PER SHARE). DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF AN ACCOUNTING CHANGE FOR THE VALUATION OF CERTAIN FCC LICENSES WAS $1.24, AN INCREASE OF 11%, OR $0.12, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $1.12.

REVENUES

MEDIA NETWORKS REVENUES INCREASED 11%, OR $1.4 BILLION, TO $14.6 BILLION, CONSISTING OF A 10% INCREASE, OR $739 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND A 12% INCREASE, OR $692 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING.

INCREASED CABLE NETWORKS REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH OF $478 MILLION FROM CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS AND $188 MILLION IN ADVERTISING

REVENUES. REVENUES FROM CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS ARE GENERALLY DERIVED FROM FEES CHARGED ON A PER SUBSCRIBER BASIS, AND THE INCREASE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT SUBSCRIBER GROWTH AT ESPN.

INCREASED ADVERTISING REVENUE WAS DUE TO HIGHER RATINGS AND RATES AT ESPN.

THE COMPANYS CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH CABLE AND

SATELLITE OPERATORS ARE RENEWED OR RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. CERTAIN OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE CURRENTLY IN NEGOTIATION.

-35-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSOLIDATION IN THE CABLE AND SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN

CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS VARIOUS CABLE AND SATELLITE PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR, REVENUES FROM CABLE NETWORKS COULD INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN IN THE PAST OR

COULD STABILIZE OR DECLINE. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS AS WELL AS CONTRACTS IN NEGOTIATION INCLUDE ANNUAL LIVE PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS. IN THESE CASES, REVENUES SUBJECT TO THE COMMITMENTS,

WHICH ARE GENERALLY COLLECTED RATABLY OVER THE YEAR, ARE DEFERRED UNTIL THE ANNUAL COMMITMENTS ARE SATISFIED, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

THE INCREASE IN BROADCASTING REVENUES WAS DUE TO GROWTH AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND INCREASED SALES OF TOUCHSTONE TELEVISION SERIES. THE GROWTH AT

THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN PRIMETIME ADVERTISING REVENUES RESULTING FROM HIGHER RATES, STRONG UPFRONT SALES, AND CONTINUED STRENGTH IN RATINGS. THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK ALSO EXPERIENCED INCREASED ADVERTISING

REVENUES FROM THE SUPER BOWL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER ADVERTISING REVENUES FROM THE ABSENCE OF MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL (MNF) WHICH MOVED TO ESPN. INCREASED SALES OF TOUCHSTONE TELEVISION SERIES REFLECTED HIGHER INTERNATIONAL SYNDICATION AND DVD

SALES OF HIT DRAMAS

LOST, GREYS ANATOMY

, AND

DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES,

AS WELL AS HIGHER THIRD PARTY LICENSE FEES LED BY

SCRUBS

, WHICH COMPLETED ITS FIFTH SEASON OF NETWORK TELEVISION.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST

PRIMARILY OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS COSTS, PRODUCTION COSTS, PARTICIPATION COSTS, DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING EXPENSES, LABOR COSTS, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, INCREASED 10%, OR $1.0 BILLION, TO $11.5 BILLION CONSISTING OF A 10% INCREASE, OR

$474 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS, AND A 10% INCREASE, OR $540 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COSTS AT ESPN DRIVEN BY HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS FROM THE NEW MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL (MLB) AND

NATIONAL FOOTBALL LEAGUE (NFL) LONG-TERM LICENSE AGREEMENTS AND AN ADDITIONAL NFL GAME. ESPN ALSO INCURRED HIGHER COSTS FOR ITS BRANDED MOBILE PHONE SERVICES, WHICH THE COMPANY RECENTLY ANNOUNCED WOULD BE TRANSITIONED INTO ITS EXISTING WIRELESS

LICENSING BUSINESS, AND HIGHER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN BROADCASTING WAS DUE TO HIGHER PROGRAMMING EXPENSES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, INCREASED PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS RELATED TO THE SALE OF TOUCHSTONE

TELEVISION SERIES, HIGHER COSTS AT THE INTERNET OPERATIONS AND RADIO, AND THE INCREASED NUMBER AND COSTS OF PILOT PRODUCTIONS. THE INCREASE IN PROGRAMMING EXPENSES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK REFLECTED COSTS RELATED TO THE SUPER BOWL PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF COSTS FROM MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2006. THE COST INCREASE AT THE INTERNET OPERATIONS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE LAUNCH OF DISNEY BRANDED MOBILE PHONE SERVICES AS WELL AS COSTS OF OTHER NEW

INITIATIVES. HIGHER COSTS AT RADIO INCLUDED AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO FCC LICENSES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH ESPN RADIO STATIONS, REFLECTING AN OVERALL MARKET DECLINE IN CERTAIN RADIO MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER INFORMATION.

SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS FOR THE PURCHASE OF TELEVISION RIGHTS FOR SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING, INCLUDING THE NATIONAL BASKETBALL

ASSOCIATION (NBA), NFL, MLB, NASCAR, AND VARIOUS COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL CONFERENCES AND FOOTBALL BOWL GAMES. THE COSTS OF THESE CONTRACTS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT YEARS. WE ENTER INTO THESE CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS WITH THE

EXPECTATION THAT, OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACTS, REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING DURING THE PROGRAMMING AND AFFILIATE FEES WILL EXCEED THE COSTS OF THE PROGRAMMING. WHILE CONTRACT COSTS MAY INITIALLY EXCEED INCREMENTAL REVENUES AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT

OPERATING INCOME, IT IS OUR EXPECTATION THAT THE COMBINED VALUE TO OUR NETWORKS FROM ALL OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL RESULT IN LONG-TERM BENEFITS. THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THESE CONTRACTS ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS IS

DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS, AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES.

IN FEBRUARY 2003, THE COMPANYS NFL CONTRACT WAS EXTENDED FOR AN ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS ENDING WITH THE TELECAST OF THE 2006 PRO BOWL. THE AGGREGATE FEE FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD WAS $3.7 BILLION. THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF THE CONTRACT EXTENSION RESULTED IN A $180 MILLION REDUCTION IN NFL PROGRAMMING COSTS AT ESPN IN FISCAL 2004 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003. THE MAJORITY OF THIS DECREASE WAS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. THESE COSTS WERE

RELATIVELY LEVEL IN FISCAL 2005 AND 2006. CASH PAYMENTS UNDER THE CONTRACT WERE $0.9 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2006 AND $1.2 BILLION FOR BOTH FISCAL 2005 AND 2004.

-36-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN APRIL 2005, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A NEW AGREEMENT WITH THE NFL FOR THE RIGHT TO BROADCAST NFL

MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL GAMES ON ESPN. THE CONTRACT PROVIDES FOR TOTAL PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $8.9 BILLION OVER AN EIGHT-YEAR PERIOD, COMMENCING WITH THE 2006-2007 SEASON. THE PAYMENT TERMS OF THE NEW CONTRACT PROVIDE FOR AVERAGE INCREASES IN THE

ANNUAL PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY 4% PER YEAR. OUR EXPENSE RECOGNITION OF THE COSTS OF THE NEW CONTRACT REFLECT THIS PAYMENT SCHEDULE. THE COMPANY HAS RIGHTS TO 21 GAMES IN THE 2006-2007 SEASON, WHICH BEGAN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF THE

COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR 2006.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 12%, OR $401 MILLION, TO $3.6 BILLION FOR THE YEAR DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $259 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND AN INCREASE OF $142 MILLION AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT THE CABLE

NETWORKS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH AT ESPN. THE INCREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DUE TO IMPROVED PRIMETIME PERFORMANCE AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND INCREASED SALES OF TOUCHSTONE TELEVISION SERIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COSTS AT INTERNET

GROUP AND RADIO, AND THE INCREASED NUMBER AND COSTS OF PILOT PRODUCTIONS. ALSO INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME IS INCOME FROM EQUITY INVESTEES OF $444 MILLION FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 COMPARED TO $460 MILLION FOR THE

PRIOR YEAR PERIOD.

ABC RADIO TRANSACTION

ON FEBRUARY 6, 2006, THE COMPANY AND CITADEL BROADCASTING CORPORATION (CITADEL) ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO MERGE THE ABC RADIO BUSINESS, WHICH CONSISTS OF 22 OF THE COMPANYS OWNED RADIO STATIONS AND THE ABC RADIO NETWORK, WITH CITADEL.

THE ESPN RADIO AND RADIO DISNEY NETWORKS AND STATION BUSINESSES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TRANSACTION. THE MERGER IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR AFTER THE ABC RADIO BUSINESS IS DISTRIBUTED TO DISNEY SHAREHOLDERS (THE DISTRIBUTION). THE AGREEMENT WAS

SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED ON NOVEMBER 19, 2006. UNDER THE AMENDED TERMS, (I) DISNEYS STOCKHOLDERS ARE EXPECTED TO COLLECTIVELY HOLD APPROXIMATELY 57% OF CITADELS COMMON STOCK POST-MERGER AND (II) THE COMPANY WOULD RETAIN BETWEEN $1.10 BILLION

AND $1.35 BILLION IN CASH, DEPENDING UPON THE MARKET PRICE OF CITADELS COMMON STOCK OVER A MEASUREMENT PERIOD ENDING PRIOR TO THE CLOSING. THIS CASH WILL BE OBTAINED FROM LOAN PROCEEDS RAISED BY ABC RADIO FROM A THIRD PARTY LENDER PRIOR TO THE

DISTRIBUTION. BASED ON CITADELS STOCK PRICE ON NOVEMBER 20, 2006, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF THE RETAINED CASH AND CITADEL COMMON STOCK TO BE RECEIVED BY DISNEY SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $2.5 BILLION. THE

AMENDED AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT THE CLOSING WILL OCCUR NO EARLIER THAN MAY 31, 2007, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVALS, AND THAT EITHER PARTY MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT IF THE CLOSING DOES NOT OCCUR BY JUNE 15, 2007.

ON NOVEMBER 21, 2006, IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXECUTION OF NEW LONG-TERM AGREEMENTS FOR THE PROVISION OF PROGRAMMING TO CABLE SERVICE PROVIDER COMCAST CORPORATION (COMCAST), THE COMPANY SOLD ITS 39.5% INTEREST IN E! ENTERTAINMENT

TELEVISION (E!) TO COMCAST (WHICH OWNED THE REMAINDER OF THE INTERESTS IN E!) FOR $1.2 BILLION, WHICH RESULTED IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF APPROXIMATELY $0.8 BILLION ($0.5 BILLION AFTER-TAX), WHICH WILL BE RECORDED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007.

PARKS AND RESORTS

REVENUES

REVENUES AT PARKS AND RESORTS INCREASED 10%, OR $902 MILLION, TO $9.9 BILLION DUE TO INCREASES OF $647 MILLION AT OUR DOMESTIC RESORTS AND A NET INCREASE

OF $255 MILLION AT OUR INTERNATIONAL RESORTS.

DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS

AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS, INCREASED REVENUES WERE DUE TO INCREASED GUEST SPENDING, THEME PARK ATTENDANCE, AND HOTEL OCCUPANCY, AS WELL AS HIGHER

SALES AT DISNEY VACATION CLUB. HIGHER GUEST SPENDING WAS DUE TO A HIGHER AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATE, HIGHER AVERAGE TICKET PRICES, AND GREATER MERCHANDISE SPENDING AT BOTH RESORTS. INCREASES IN ATTENDANCE AND HOTEL OCCUPANCY WERE LED BY THE

50TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION AT BOTH DOMESTIC RESORTS, WHICH CONCLUDED AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER 2006.

INTERNATIONAL PARKS AND RESORTS

INTERNATIONAL REVENUE GROWTH REFLECTED THE FIRST FULL YEAR OF THEME PARK OPERATIONS AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR WHEN THE

PARK OPENED IN MID-SEPTEMBER 2005. DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS ALSO EXPERIENCED INCREASED REVENUES, HOWEVER THIS INCREASE WAS MORE THAN OFFSET BY THE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR

AGAINST THE EURO.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES INCREASED 7%, OR $547 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME-RELATED COSTS AND COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW GUEST OFFERINGS AND ATTRACTIONS AT THE DOMESTIC RESORTS, AND HIGHER OPERATING COSTS AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND

RESORT REFLECTING A FULL YEAR OF THEME PARK OPERATIONS. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF PRE-OPENING COSTS AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT, LOWER COSTS AT DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS DUE TO THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO, AND THE BENEFIT FROM ADJUSTMENTS TO ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED WORKERS COMPENSATION AND GUEST CLAIMS LIABILITIES BASED ON FAVORABLE CLAIMS EXPERIENCE AT THE

DOMESTIC RESORTS.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 30%, OR $356 MILLION, TO $1.5 BILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO CONTINUED STRENGTH AT BOTH DOMESTIC RESORTS, LED BY THE SUCCESS OF THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION, THE FIRST YEAR OF OPERATIONS AT HONG KONG

DISNEYLAND RESORT, AND IMPROVEMENTS AT DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS.

STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT

REVENUES

REVENUES DECREASED 1%, OR $58 MILLION, TO $7.5 BILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF $578

MILLION IN WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF $415 MILLION IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION, AND AN INCREASE OF $60 MILLION IN MUSIC DISTRIBUTION.

LOWER WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECLINE IN UNIT SALES RESULTING FROM A HIGHER NUMBER OF STRONG PERFORMING TITLES IN

THE PRIOR YEAR PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SALES OF TELEVISION DVD BOX-SETS AND REDUCED MARKETING AND TRADE PROGRAMS. SIGNIFICANT CURRENT YEAR TITLES INCLUDED

THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE, CINDERELLA

PLATINUM RELEASE

, AND

CHICKEN LITTLE,

WHILE PRIOR-YEAR TITLES INCLUDED DISNEY/PIXARS

THE INCREDIBLES, NATIONAL TREASURE, ALADDIN

PLATINUM RELEASE, AND

BAMBI

PLATINUM RELEASE.

THE INCREASE IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE STRONG BOX-OFFICE PERFORMANCE OF

PIRATES OF THE

CARIBBEAN: DEAD MANS CHEST

,

THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE,

AND DISNEY/PIXARS

CARS

COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR TITLES, WHICH INCLUDED

THE INCREDIBLES

AND

NATIONAL TREASURE.

THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUE RESULTING FROM FEWER DOMESTIC MIRAMAX THEATRICAL RELEASES IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

-38-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION, DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING EXPENSES, PRODUCT COSTS, AND PARTICIPATION COSTS, DECREASED 8%, OR $580 MILLION. LOWER COSTS AND EXPENSES WERE

PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION AND HIGHER MUSIC DISTRIBUTION EXPENSES.

THE DECLINE IN COSTS AND EXPENSES AT WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED MARKETING EXPENDITURES, LOWER PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION

DRIVEN BY DECREASED UNIT SALES, AND LOWER DISTRIBUTION COSTS DRIVEN IN PART BY FEWER RETURNS.

HIGHER COSTS AND EXPENSES IN WORLDWIDE

THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN DISTRIBUTION COSTS, PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION AND PARTICIPATION COSTS. THE INCREASE IN DISTRIBUTION COSTS WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER PROFILE FILMS IN THE CURRENT YEAR THAT HAD

MORE EXTENSIVE MARKETING CAMPAIGNS TO LAUNCH THE FILMS. HIGHER PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION AND PARTICIPATION COSTS WERE DRIVEN BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: DEAD MANS CHEST

AND

THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE

LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COSTS AND EXPENSES RESULTING FROM FEWER DOMESTIC MIRAMAX THEATRICAL RELEASES IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED $522 MILLION, TO $729 MILLION, PRIMARILY

DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION AND WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT.

FILM FINANCING

IN AUGUST 2005, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A FILM FINANCING ARRANGEMENT WITH A GROUP OF INVESTORS WHEREBY THE INVESTORS WILL FUND UP TO APPROXIMATELY $500

MILLION FOR 40% OF THE PRODUCTION AND MARKETING COSTS OF A SLATE OF UP TO THIRTY-TWO LIVE-ACTION FILMS, EXCLUDING CERTAIN TITLES SUCH AS

THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE

AND, IN GENERAL, SEQUELS TO PREVIOUS

FILMS, IN RETURN FOR APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE FUTURE NET CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY THESE FILMS. BY ENTERING INTO THIS TRANSACTION, THE COMPANY IS ABLE TO SHARE THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF THE PERFORMANCE OF ITS LIVE-ACTION FILM PRODUCTION AND

DISTRIBUTION ACTIVITY WITH OUTSIDE INVESTORS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THE INVESTORS HAVE PARTICIPATED IN THE FUNDING OF THIRTEEN FILMS. THE CUMULATIVE INVESTMENT IN THE SLATE BY THE INVESTORS, NET OF THE CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY THE SLATE THAT

ARE RETURNED TO THE INVESTORS, IS CLASSIFIED AS BORROWINGS. INTEREST EXPENSE RECOGNIZED FROM THESE BORROWINGS IS VARIABLE AND IS DETERMINED USING THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST METHOD BASED ON THE PROJECTED PROFITABILITY OF THE FILM SLATE.

PIXAR ACQUISITION

ON MAY 5, 2006, THE COMPANY

ACQUIRED PIXAR IN AN ALL-STOCK TRANSACTION AND PIXAR BECAME A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT OF THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY NOW PRODUCES FEATURE ANIMATION FILMS UNDER BOTH THE DISNEY AND PIXAR BANNERS. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

REGARDING THE ACQUISITION OF PIXAR IS SET FORTH IN NOTE 3 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND IN ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS, ABOVE.

CONSUMER PRODUCTS

REVENUES

REVENUES INCREASED 3%, OR $66 MILLION, TO $2.2 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES OF $112 MILLION AT BUENA VISTA GAMES AND $91 MILLION AT MERCHANDISE LICENSING. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $106 MILLION AT THE

DISNEY STORES PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALE OF THE DISNEY STORE NORTH AMERICA CHAIN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005.

SALES GROWTH AT BUENA VISTA

GAMES WAS DUE TO THE RELEASE OF SELF-PUBLISHED TITLES BASED ON

THE CHRONICLES OF NARNIA: THE LION, THE WITCH AND THE WARDROBE

,

CHICKEN LITTLE

, AND

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN

. SALES GROWTH AT MERCHANDISE LICENSING WAS DRIVEN BY

HIGHER EARNED ROYALTIES ACROSS MULTIPLE PRODUCT CATEGORIES, LED BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

CARS, DISNEY PRINCESS,

AND

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN

MERCHANDISE.

-39-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT AT $1.6 BILLION AS DECREASES AT THE DISNEY STORES WERE OFFSET BY INCREASES AT BUENA VISTA GAMES. THE DECREASES IN COSTS AND EXPENSES AT THE DISNEY STORES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO

THE SALE OF THE DISNEY STORE NORTH AMERICA CHAIN IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005. COSTS AND EXPENSES INCREASED AT BUENA VISTA GAMES DUE TO HIGHER COSTS OF GOODS SOLD DRIVEN BY INCREASED VOLUMES, INCREASED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SPENDING ON BOTH

CURRENT AND FUTURE TITLES, AND HIGHER MARKETING EXPENDITURES.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 14%, OR $75 MILLION, TO $618 MILLION, DUE TO GROWTH AT MERCHANDISE LICENSING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE AT BUENA

VISTA GAMES. GROWTH AT MERCHANDISE LICENSING WAS DUE TO HIGHER EARNED ROYALTIES ACROSS MULTIPLE PRODUCT CATEGORIES. THE DECREASE AT BUENA VISTA GAMES WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SPENDING ON FUTURE SELF-PUBLISHED TITLES.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT  SALE OF US WEEKLY

ON

OCTOBER 2, 2006, THE COMPANY SOLD ITS 50 PERCENT STAKE IN

(1)%

INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED 17% FOR THE YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INTEREST EXPENSE AT HONG KONG

DISNEYLAND AND HIGHER EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES AND AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES. DURING THE PRIOR YEAR, HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS INTEREST EXPENSE WAS CAPITALIZED WHEN THE PARK WAS UNDER CONSTRUCTION.

INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME FOR THE YEAR INCREASED DUE TO A $42 MILLION WRITE-DOWN IN THE PRIOR YEAR OF AN INVESTMENT IN A COMPANY THAT LICENSES

TECHNOLOGY TO THE MOVIEBEAM VENTURE AND INCREASED INTEREST INCOME FROM HIGHER CASH BALANCES.

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE INCREASED 3.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 31.1% IN 2005 TO 34.7% IN 2006. THE LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR THE PRIOR YEAR

REFLECTED A GREATER RELEASE OF RESERVES AS A RESULT OF THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN TAX MATTERS AND THE BENEFIT FROM A ONE-TIME DEDUCTION PERMITTED UNDER THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 RELATED TO THE REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS.

PENSION AND BENEFIT COSTS

PENSION

AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN COSTS AFFECT RESULTS IN ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS, WITH THE MAJORITY OF THESE COSTS BEING BORNE BY THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSES OF

$462 MILLION, $314 MILLION, AND $374 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS ENDED 2006, 2005, AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2006 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO A DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS. THE

DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION DECREASED FROM 6.30% TO 5.25%, REFLECTING TRENDS IN PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES AT OUR JUNE 30, 2005 VALUATION DATE.

-40-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE EXPECT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS TO DECREASE TO $273 MILLION IN FISCAL 2007 WITH

APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THESE COSTS BEING BORNE BY THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT. THE DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION FROM 5.25% TO 6.40%, REFLECTING INCREASES IN PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES ON OUR

JUNE 30, 2006 VALUATION DATE. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE FOR PENSION PLANS REFLECTS THE MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION

YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS, WHICH INCLUDED VOLUNTARY

CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PENSION PLANS. BASED ON THE JANUARY 1, 2006 FUNDING VALUATION, THE COMPANY IS NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLANS DURING FISCAL 2007. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS TO

CONTRIBUTE, AT A MINIMUM, $19 MILLION TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS DURING FISCAL 2007. THE COMPANY MAY MAKE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS INTO ITS PENSION PLANS IN FISCAL 2007 DEPENDING ON HOW THE FUNDED STATUS OF THOSE PLANS CHANGE

AND AS WE GAIN MORE CLARITY WITH RESPECT TO THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 (PPA) THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON AUGUST 17, 2006. THE UNITED STATES TREASURY DEPARTMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR THE PPA;

HOWEVER, IT IS LIKELY THE PPA WILL ACCELERATE MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2009. THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE TO PRE-FUND SOME OF THIS ANTICIPATED FUNDING.

PENSION OBLIGATIONS EXCEED PLAN ASSETS FOR A NUMBER OF OUR PENSION PLANS. IN THIS SITUATION, THE ACCOUNTING RULES REQUIRE THAT WE RECORD AN ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY. THE MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY

ADJUSTMENT AT YEAR END FISCAL 2006 AND FISCAL 2005 IS AS FOLLOWS (IN MILLIONS).

THE DECREASE IN THE MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY IN FISCAL 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE

IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FROM 5.25% TO 6.40%. THE ACCOUNTING RULES DO NOT REQUIRE THAT CHANGES IN THE ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT BE RECORDED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS, BUT RATHER THEY ARE RECORDED DIRECTLY TO EQUITY THROUGH

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. EXPENSE RECOGNITION UNDER THE PENSION ACCOUNTING RULES IS BASED UPON LONG-TERM TRENDS OVER THE EXPECTED LIFE OF THE COMPANYS WORKFORCE. SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION.

$1.4 BILLION, TO $13.2 BILLION, CONSISTING OF A 13% INCREASE, OR $852 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND AN 11% INCREASE, OR $577 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING.

INCREASED CABLE NETWORKS REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH OF $690 MILLION FROM CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS AND $172 MILLION IN ADVERTISING REVENUES. REVENUES FROM CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS ARE

GENERALLY DERIVED FROM FEES CHARGED ON A PER SUBSCRIBER BASIS, AND THE INCREASE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES AND SUBSCRIBER GROWTH AT ESPN AND THE DISNEY CHANNELS. INCREASED ADVERTISING REVENUE WAS DUE TO HIGHER RATES AT

ESPN AND HIGHER RATINGS AT ABC FAMILY.

-41-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCREASED BROADCASTING REVENUES WERE DUE TO GROWTH AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND TELEVISION

PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. ABC TELEVISION NETWORK REVENUES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRIMETIME ADVERTISING REVENUE RESULTING FROM HIGHER RATINGS AND ADVERTISING RATES. THE GROWTH AT TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION WAS DRIVEN BY

HIGHER LICENSE FEE REVENUES FROM DOMESTIC MARKETS AS A RESULT OF THE SYNDICATION OF

MY WIFE AND KIDS

AND HIGHER REVENUE IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS FROM SALES OF

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES, CONSISTING

PRIMARILY OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS COSTS, PRODUCTION COSTS, PARTICIPATION COSTS, DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING EXPENSES, LABOR COSTS, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, INCREASED 9%, OR $849 MILLION, TO $10.5 BILLION CONSISTING OF AN 11% INCREASE, OR

$491 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS, AND A 7% INCREASE, OR $358 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES AT ESPN FROM HIGHER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCREASED PRODUCTION COSTS, AND INVESTMENTS IN

NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES, INCLUDING ESPN BRANDED MOBILE PHONE SERVICES. HIGHER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, PROGRAMMING EXPENSES, AND MARKETING COSTS AT THE DISNEY CHANNELS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS. THE INCREASE AT

BROADCASTING WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER PRODUCTION AND PARTICIPATION COSTS AT TV PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R INCREASED EXPENSES IN FISCAL YEAR 2005 AT CABLE NETWORKS AND AT BROADCASTING BY $36 MILLION AND $64 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 25%, OR $635 MILLION, TO $3.2 BILLION FOR THE YEAR DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $416 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND AN INCREASE OF $219 MILLION AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS WAS DUE TO GROWTH

AT ESPN FROM HIGHER AFFILIATE REVENUES AND ADVERTISING REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COSTS AND EXPENSES AT ESPN. ADDITIONALLY, EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES AT CABLE NETWORKS INCREASED $55 MILLION DRIVEN BY HIGHER AFFILIATE REVENUE AT

LIFETIME TELEVISION. THE INCREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER PRIMETIME ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND HIGHER LICENSE FEE REVENUES FROM SYNDICATION OF

MY WIFE AND KIDS

AND INTERNATIONAL SALES OF

LOST

DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES

AT TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION.

MOVIEBEAM

THE COMPANY LAUNCHED MOVIEBEAM, AN ON-DEMAND ELECTRONIC MOVIE RENTAL SERVICE IN THREE DOMESTIC CITIES IN OCTOBER 2003. THE COMPANY SUSPENDED SERVICE IN

APRIL 2005 WHILE EVALUATING ITS GO-FORWARD BUSINESS MODEL AND NEGOTIATING A REFINANCING OF THE BUSINESS WITH STRATEGIC AND FINANCIAL INVESTORS. BASED ON NEGOTIATIONS WITH INVESTORS, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT ANY SUCH REFINANCING WOULD NOT BE

SUFFICIENT TO RECOVER ALL OF ITS INVESTMENT RELATED TO THE MOVIEBEAM VENTURE AND RECOGNIZED $56 MILLION ($35 MILLION AFTER-TAX OR $0.02 PER SHARE) OF IMPAIRMENT CHARGES DURING THE YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 1, 2005. IN JANUARY 2006, THE COMPANY

COMPLETED A REFINANCING TRANSACTION WITH OUTSIDE INVESTORS THAT RESULTED IN THE COMPANY RETAINING ONLY A MINORITY INTEREST IN THE MOVIEBEAM VENTURE.

PARKS AND RESORTS

REVENUES

REVENUES AT PARKS AND RESORTS INCREASED 16%, OR $1.3 BILLION, TO $9.0 BILLION. THE COMPANY BEGAN CONSOLIDATING THE RESULTS OF EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND AT THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, WHICH RESULTED IN

FISCAL 2004 SEGMENT RESULTS INCLUDING ONLY SIX MONTHS OF OPERATIONS OF THESE BUSINESSES WHILE FISCAL 2005 INCLUDES A FULL YEAR OF OPERATIONS. THE IMPACT OF FISCAL 2005 INCLUDING AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF OPERATIONS AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004

ACCOUNTED FOR AN 8% OR $672 MILLION INCREASE IN PARKS AND RESORTS REVENUE FOR THE YEAR THAT REPRESENTS THE REVENUES OF EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND FOR THE FIRST HALF OF FISCAL 2005. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF INCLUDING THE ADDITIONAL SIX

MONTHS OF EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND OPERATIONS, FISCAL 2005 REVENUES GREW 8%, OR $601 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH OF $364 MILLION AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT AND $213 MILLION AT THE DISNEYLAND RESORT.

AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT, INCREASED REVENUES WERE DUE TO HIGHER OCCUPIED ROOM NIGHTS, THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND GUEST SPENDING, AND INCREASED

SALES AT DISNEYS VACATION CLUB. INCREASED OCCUPIED ROOM NIGHTS REFLECTED INCREASED VISITATION TO THE RESORT REFLECTING THE ONGOING RECOVERY IN TRAVEL AND TOURISM, THE POPULARITY OF DISNEY AS A TRAVEL DESTINATION, AND THE AVAILABILITY OF

ADDITIONAL ROOMS IN BOTH THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTERS OF THE PRIOR YEAR. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER, THE COMPANY LAUNCHED TWO PROGRAMS,

DISNEYS MAGICAL EXPRESS

AND

INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC GUEST VISITATION, DRIVEN BY THE

HAPPIEST CELEBRATION ON EARTH

PROMOTION WHICH CELEBRATES THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY OF DISNEYLAND. HIGHER GUEST SPENDING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER FOOD AND BEVERAGE PURCHASES, TICKET

PRICE INCREASES, AND FEWER PROMOTIONAL OFFERS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR.

AT THE DISNEYLAND RESORT, INCREASED REVENUES WERE DRIVEN BY

HIGHER GUEST SPENDING AND ATTENDANCE AT THE THEME PARKS DUE TO INCREASED TICKET PRICES AND THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION, RESPECTIVELY.

COSTS AND EXPENSES INCREASED 18%, OR $1.2 BILLION, TO $7.8 BILLION. AS NOTED ABOVE, FISCAL 2005 INCLUDED AN ADDITIONAL SIX

MONTHS OF EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND OPERATIONS, WHICH ACCOUNTED FOR AN 11% OR $722 MILLION INCREASE IN COSTS AND EXPENSES FOR THE YEAR. IN ADDITION, THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R INCREASED EXPENSES BY $42 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2005. THE

REMAINING INCREASE OF $454 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COSTS AT WALT DISNEY WORLD AND DISNEYLAND AND INCREASED PRE-OPENING COSTS AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND. WALT DISNEY WORLD INCURRED HIGHER VOLUME-RELATED EXPENSES, INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED

WITH NEW ATTRACTIONS AND SERVICE PROGRAMS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY, AND HIGHER FIXED COSTS. DISNEYLAND INCURRED HIGHER VOLUME-RELATED EXPENSES, INCREASED MARKETING AND SALES COSTS DUE TO THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION, AND HIGHER FIXED COSTS.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 9%, OR $101 MILLION, TO $1.2 BILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD AND DISNEYLAND RESORT. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PRE-OPENING EXPENSES AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND IN THE SECOND HALF

OF THE YEAR AND STOCK OPTION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R IN FISCAL YEAR 2005.

STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT

REVENUES

REVENUES DECREASED 13%, OR $1.1 BILLION, TO

$7.6 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF $1.1 BILLION IN WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT. THE DECLINE IN REVENUES AT WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT WAS DUE TO AN OVERALL DECLINE IN DVD UNIT SALES RESULTING FROM A LOWER PERFORMING SLATE OF CURRENT

YEAR TITLES, INCLUDING A DECLINE IN THE RATIO OF HOME VIDEO UNIT SALES TO THE RELATED TOTAL DOMESTIC BOX-OFFICE RESULTS FOR FEATURE FILMS. SUCCESSFUL CURRENT YEAR TITLES INCLUDED

THE INCREDIBLES, NATIONAL TREASURE, BAMBI

PLATINUM RELEASE, AND

ALADDIN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES DECREASED 8%, OR $671 MILLION, DUE TO LOWER COSTS IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION AND IN WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT. THE DECLINE IN COSTS AND EXPENSES AT WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL

DISTRIBUTION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND LOWER PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION. DISTRIBUTION COSTS WERE LOWER AS THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED HIGHER PROFILE FILMS THAT HAD EXTENSIVE MARKETING CAMPAIGNS TO LAUNCH THE FILMS. THE DECREASE

IN PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER FILM COST WRITE-OFFS. THESE COST DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION, AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS AT MIRAMAX DUE TO AN INCREASED NUMBER OF RELEASES AND HIGHER

WRITE-OFFS. LOWER COSTS IN WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DISTRIBUTION COSTS, PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION, AND PARTICIPATION COSTS. DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION WERE LOWER AS A RESULT OF DECREASED

UNIT SALES. PARTICIPATION COSTS WERE LOWER AS THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED

FINDING NEMO

AND

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: THE CURSE OF THE BLACK PEARL

, WHICH HAD HIGHER PARTICIPATION COSTS DUE TO BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN CURRENT YEAR TITLES.

PIXAR RECEIVED AN EQUAL SHARE OF PROFITS (AFTER DISTRIBUTION FEES) AS CO-PRODUCER OF

FINDING NEMO

AND

THE INCREDIBLES.

THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R INCREASED EXPENSES BY $41 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2005.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

DECREASED 69%, OR $455 MILLION, TO $207 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OVERALL UNIT SALES IN WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND A DECLINE AT MIRAMAX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BETTER PERFORMANCE IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION.

MIRAMAX

IN MARCH 2005, THE COMPANY

ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH MIRAMAX CO-CHAIRMEN, BOB AND HARVEY WEINSTEIN, AND THEIR NEW PRODUCTION COMPANY. PURSUANT TO THOSE AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SUBSTANTIALLY RESOLVED ALL ECONOMIC ISSUES RELATING TO THE WEINSTEINS

EXISTING EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS; TERMINATED THE WEINSTEINS THEN-EXISTING EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS AND ENTERED INTO REVISED EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS WITH THEM THROUGH SEPTEMBER 30, 2005; SOLD INTERESTS IN CERTAIN FILMS IN VARIOUS STAGES OF

PRODUCTION TO THE WEINSTEINS NEW COMPANY; AND PROVIDED IT WITH THE OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, AS WELL AS SEQUEL RIGHTS TO CERTAIN LIBRARY PRODUCT. THE COMPANY RETAINS CERTAIN CO-FINANCING, DISTRIBUTION, AND

PARTICIPATION RIGHTS IN SEVERAL OF THESE PROPERTIES. THE COMPANY ALSO RETAINS THE MIRAMAX AND DIMENSION FILM LIBRARIES AND THE NAME MIRAMAX FILMS, WHILE THE WEINSTEINS TOOK THE DIMENSION NAME TO THEIR NEW COMPANY. NO MATERIAL CHARGES

WERE RECORDED AS A RESULT OF THE EXECUTION OF THE AGREEMENTS.

CONSUMER PRODUCTS

REVENUES

REVENUES DECREASED 15%, OR $384 MILLION, TO $2.1 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF

$543 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE SALE OF THE DISNEY STORE NORTH AMERICA IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005. THIS DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES AT MERCHANDISE LICENSING AND BUENA VISTA GAMES OF $118 MILLION AND $53 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE LICENSING WAS DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES ACROSS MULTIPLE PRODUCT CATEGORIES AND RECOGNITION OF

CONTRACTUAL MINIMUM GUARANTEE REVENUES THAT INCREASED BY $49 MILLION IN FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004. THE INCREASE AT BUENA VISTA GAMES WAS DUE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF

THE INCREDIBLES

LICENSED PRODUCTS, RECOGNITION OF CONTRACTUAL MINIMUM

GUARANTEE REVENUE, WHICH INCREASED BY $17 MILLION IN FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004, AND HIGHER SALES OF GAME BOY ADVANCE GAMES.

COSTS AND

EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES DECREASED 19%, OR $370 MILLION, TO $1.6 BILLION, DUE TO A DECREASE OF $528 MILLION RELATED TO THE SALE OF

THE DISNEY STORE NORTH AMERICA CHAIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SPENDING AT BUENA VISTA GAMES, INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES AT MERCHANDISE LICENSING, AND $20 MILLION OF STOCK OPTION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADOPTION OF SFAS

123R IN FISCAL YEAR 2005.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 1%, OR $4 MILLION, TO $543 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OPERATING INCOME AT THE DISNEY STORE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH IN MERCHANDISE LICENSING.

DISNEY STORES

EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 21, 2004, THE COMPANY SOLD SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DISNEY STORE CHAIN IN NORTH AMERICA UNDER A LONG-TERM LICENSING ARRANGEMENT TO A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE CHILDRENS PLACE (TCP). THE COMPANY RECEIVED

$100 MILLION FOR THE WORKING CAPITAL TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER AT THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION. DURING FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED A LOSS ON THE WORKING CAPITAL THAT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER AND ADDITIONAL RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES RELATED TO THE SALE (PRIMARILY FOR EMPLOYEE RETENTION AND SEVERANCE AND LEASE TERMINATION COSTS) TOTALING $32 MILLION. PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF SALE, THE DISNEY STORE NORTH AMERICA RETAINED ITS LEASE OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THE STORES

TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER AND BECAME A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TCP. TCP IS REQUIRED TO PAY THE COMPANY A ROYALTY ON SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PHYSICAL RETAIL STORE SALES BEGINNING ON THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE CLOSING DATE OF THE SALE.

DURING FISCAL YEAR 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED $64 MILLION OF RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE DISNEY STORES. THE BULK

OF THESE CHARGES WERE IMPAIRMENTS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF FIXED ASSETS RELATED TO THE STORES THAT WERE SOLD.

EXCLUDING AN INCREASE OF $36 MILLION DUE TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG

DISNEYLAND FOR A FULL TWELVE MONTHS IN FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO SIX MONTHS IN FISCAL 2004, INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED 10%, OR $60 MILLION FOR THE YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES.

AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASE CHARGES INCREASED AS A RESULT OF THE WRITE-OFF OF OUR LEVERAGED-LEASE INVESTMENT WITH DELTA AIR LINES, INC.

(DELTA) AFTER DELTAS BANKRUPTCY FILING IN SEPTEMBER 2005. IN FISCAL 2004, WE TOOK A PARTIAL WRITE-DOWN OF OUR INVESTMENT WITH DELTA CONSISTENT WITH OUR AGREEMENT WITH DELTA TO REDUCE LEASE PAYMENTS. IN THE EVENT OF A MATERIAL MODIFICATION TO

THE REMAINING DELTA AIRCRAFT LEASES OR FORECLOSURE OF THE DELTA AIRCRAFT BY THE DEBT HOLDERS, CERTAIN TAX PAYMENTS OF UP TO $40 MILLION, AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, COULD BE ACCELERATED. THE EXPECTED TAX PAYMENTS ARE CURRENTLY REFLECTED ON OUR

BALANCE SHEET AS A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A FURTHER CHARGE TO EARNINGS.

FISCAL YEAR 2005 INTEREST AND

INVESTMENT INCOME INCLUDED $19 MILLION IN GAINS FROM THE SALES OF INVESTMENTS.

NET INTEREST EXPENSE WAS ALSO IMPACTED BY A $61 MILLION GAIN (PRIMARILY NON-CASH) THAT WAS RECORDED BY

EURO DISNEY AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING OF EURO DISNEYS BORROWINGS. SEE NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

EFFECTIVE

INCOME TAX RATE

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE DECREASED 0.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 32.0% IN 2004 TO 31.1% IN 2005. THE EFFECTIVE TAX

RATES REFLECT THE RELEASE OF RESERVES AS A RESULT OF THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN TAX MATTERS IN BOTH FISCAL 2005 AND FISCAL 2004. IN ADDITION, FISCAL 2005 REFLECTS THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF A ONE-TIME DEDUCTION UNDER THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION

AND CASH FLOWS OF THESE TWO BUSINESSES EFFECTIVE WITH THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004.

-47-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT ARE PRINCIPALLY FOR THEME PARK AND

RESORT EXPANSION, NEW RIDES AND ATTRACTIONS AND RECURRING CAPITAL AND CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS. THE DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INVESTMENT AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESULTING FROM SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION OF THE PARK

PRIOR TO ITS OPENING IN SEPTEMBER 2005, AS WELL AS LOWER EXPENDITURES AT THE DOMESTIC THEME PARKS DUE TO INCREASED INVESTMENT IN THE PRIOR YEAR IN PREPARATION FOR THE DISNEYLAND 50

TH

ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

AT MEDIA NETWORKS PRIMARILY REFLECT INVESTMENTS IN FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT FOR EXPANDING AND UPGRADING BROADCAST CENTERS, PRODUCTION FACILITIES, AND TELEVISION STATION FACILITIES.

CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED SHARED CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE PRIMARILY FOR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE.

OTHER INVESTING ACTIVITIES

DURING FISCAL 2006, $1.1

BILLION OF INVESTMENTS WERE LIQUIDATED AND THE SALES OF A CABLE TELEVISION EQUITY INVESTMENT AND A MAGAZINE BUSINESS GENERATED $81 MILLION. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY PURCHASED $82 MILLION OF FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE COMPANY AMENDED ITS TWO BANK FACILITIES. THE AMENDMENTS INCLUDED AN

EXTENSION OF THE MATURITY OF ONE OF THE FACILITIES FROM 2009 TO 2011. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ALSO INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF LETTERS OF CREDIT THAT CAN BE ISSUED TO $800 MILLION FROM $500 MILLION UNDER THE FACILITY EXPIRING IN 2011, WHICH IF

UTILIZED, REDUCES AVAILABLE BORROWING UNDER THIS FACILITY. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, $261 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT HAD BEEN ISSUED, OF WHICH $213 MILLION WAS ISSUED UNDER THE FACILITIES. THESE BANK FACILITIES ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS AT

LIBOR-BASED RATES PLUS A SPREAD, WHICH DEPENDS ON THE COMPANYS PUBLIC DEBT RATING AND CAN RANGE FROM 0.175% TO 0.75%. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD NOT BORROWED UNDER THESE BANK FACILITIES.

THE COMPANY MAY USE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS UP TO THE AMOUNT OF ITS ABOVE UNUSED BANK FACILITIES, IN CONJUNCTION WITH TERM DEBT ISSUANCE AND

OPERATING CASH FLOW, TO RETIRE OR REFINANCE OTHER BORROWINGS BEFORE OR AS THEY COME DUE.

AS OF THE FILING DATE OF THIS REPORT, THE BOARD

OF DIRECTORS HAD NOT YET DECLARED A DIVIDEND RELATED TO FISCAL 2006. THE COMPANY PAID A $519 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.27 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006 RELATED TO FISCAL 2005; PAID A $490 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.24 PER SHARE) DURING

THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005 RELATED TO FISCAL 2004; AND PAID A $430 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.21 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 RELATED TO FISCAL 2003.

DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 243 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY $6.9 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2005, THE

COMPANY REPURCHASED 91 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR $2.4 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 15 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY $335 MILLION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THE COMPANY

HAD AUTHORIZATION IN PLACE TO REPURCHASE APPROXIMATELY 206 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH BALANCES, OTHER LIQUID ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE

RESOURCES TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAN

BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL. IN ADDITION TO MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE COMPANYS BORROWING COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN

SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CERTAIN CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE

COMPANY WERE A3 AND P-2, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK; AND STANDARD & POORS LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A- AND A-2, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK. THE COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY

ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT, RELATING TO INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE COMPANY MET ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. THE COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES ALSO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE CERTAIN ENTITIES, SUCH AS EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG

DISNEYLAND, FROM ANY REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS, OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR 2006, HONG KONG DISNEYLAND IS SUBJECT TO

SEMI-ANNUAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COVENANTS UNDER ITS COMMERCIAL TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT. THE COMMERCIAL TERM LOAN HAD A BALANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $293 MILLION ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY HAS NOT

BEEN DRAWN ON TO DATE. IN JULY 2006, LENDERS UNDER THE COMMERCIAL TERM LOAN AND REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT PROVIDED A WAIVER TO THESE COVENANTS FOR THE SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND MARCH 31, 2007 MEASUREMENT DATES. THE REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY

WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE FOR THE PERIOD THE WAIVER IS IN EFFECT UNLESS THE COVENANTS ARE, IN FACT, SATISFIED DURING THE PERIOD. THE COVENANTS WILL BE IN EFFECT FOR THE SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 MEASUREMENT DATE.

-49-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EURO DISNEY HAS COVENANTS UNDER ITS DEBT AGREEMENTS THAT LIMIT ITS INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

BEGINNING WITH FISCAL YEAR 2006, EURO DISNEY MUST ALSO MEET FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE COVENANTS THAT NECESSITATE EARNINGS GROWTH. AS A RESULT OF REVENUE GROWTH IN EXCESS OF INCREASES IN COSTS AND EXPENSES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2006, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

THAT EURO DISNEY IS IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS FOR FISCAL 2006. PURSUANT TO THE DEBT AGREEMENTS, COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS IS SUBJECT TO FINAL THIRD-PARTY CONFIRMATION.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE COVENANTS REFERRED TO IN THE PRIOR TWO PARAGRAPHS WILL BE MET FOR ANY PARTICULAR MEASUREMENT PERIOD. TO THE EXTENT

THAT CONDITIONS ARE SUCH THAT THE COVENANTS APPEAR UNLIKELY TO BE MET, MANAGEMENT WOULD PURSUE MEASURES TO MEET THE COVENANTS, INCLUDING INCREASING REVENUES OR REDUCING EXPENSES, OR WOULD SEEK TO OBTAIN WAIVERS FROM THE DEBT HOLDERS.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS WHICH ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. OTHER ITEMS, SUCH AS CERTAIN PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND OTHER EXECUTORY CONTRACTS ARE NOT

RECOGNIZED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BUT ARE REQUIRED TO BE DISCLOSED IN THE FOOTNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY COMMITTED TO ACQUIRE BROADCAST PROGRAMMING AND MAKE CERTAIN

MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS FOR THE USE OF PROPERTY UNDER OPERATING LEASE AGREEMENTS.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES OUR SIGNIFICANT

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND THE FUTURE PERIODS IN WHICH SUCH OBLIGATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE SETTLED IN CASH. IN ADDITION, THE TABLE REFLECTS THE TIMING OF PRINCIPAL AND

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OUTSOURCING

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH TWO SUPPLIERS TO OUTSOURCE CERTAIN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS AND SUPPORT SERVICES. THE TRANSITION OF SERVICES TO THE NEW SUPPLIERS BEGAN IN LATE JULY 2005. THE TERMS OF

THESE AGREEMENTS EXTEND FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS WITH AN OPTION FOR THE COMPANY TO EXTEND FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO TO THREE YEARS. THE COMPANY HAS RETAINED ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY FOR SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE, TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY, AND PRODUCT STANDARDS

UNDER THE AGREEMENTS. PAYMENTS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE ABOVE BECAUSE THE PAYMENTS VARY DEPENDING ON USAGE, BUT THE COMPANY CURRENTLY ANTICIPATES SPENDING APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION FOR THESE SERVICES OVER THE NEXT SIX

YEARS.

DVD MANUFACTURING ARRANGEMENT

THE COMPANY HAS A SOLE-SOURCE ARRANGEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURER TO MEET THE COMPANYS DVD MANUFACTURING AND WAREHOUSING REQUIREMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES AND A NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETS THAT EXPIRES DECEMBER 31,

2006. PAYMENTS UNDER THIS ARRANGEMENT ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE ABOVE SINCE THERE ARE NEITHER FIXED NOR MINIMUM QUANTITIES UNDER THE ARRANGEMENT. TOTAL PAYMENTS FOR FISCAL 2006 WERE APPROXIMATELY $0.5 BILLION.

LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS

AS DISCLOSED IN NOTES 8 AND 14

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR CERTAIN LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRE

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT. FOR A SUMMARY OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND COSTS

WE EXPENSE

THE COST OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO THE ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FOR EACH PRODUCTION. IF OUR

ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES DECREASES, AMORTIZATION OF FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS WILL BE ACCELERATED. CONVERSELY, IF ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES INCREASE, FILM AND TELEVISION COST AMORTIZATION WILL BE SLOWED. FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ULTIMATE

REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION SERIES, WE INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR

IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER. FOR ACQUIRED FILM LIBRARIES, REMAINING REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO BE EARNED FOR UP TO TWENTY YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.

WITH RESPECT TO FILMS INTENDED FOR THEATRICAL RELEASE, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES (AND THEREFORE AFFECTING

FILM COST AMORTIZATION AND/OR IMPAIRMENT) IS DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. REVENUES DERIVED FROM OTHER MARKETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE DOMESTIC THEATRICAL RELEASE (E.G. THE HOME VIDEO OR INTERNATIONAL THEATRICAL MARKETS) HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHLY

CORRELATED WITH DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE VARIES PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND DEMAND FOR A PARTICULAR FILM, THE QUALITY OF COMPETING FILMS AT THE TIME OF RELEASE, AS WELL AS THE LEVEL OF

MARKETING EFFORT. UPON A FILMS RELEASE AND DETERMINATION OF DOMESTIC THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANYS ESTIMATES OF REVENUES FROM SUCCEEDING WINDOWS AND MARKETS ARE REVISED BASED ON HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS. THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR

AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR RELEASED FILMS IS THE EXTENT OF HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES ACHIEVED. HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES VARY BASED ON THE VOLUME AND QUALITY OF COMPETING HOME VIDEO PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE MANNER IN WHICH

RETAILERS MARKET AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO TELEVISION SERIES OR OTHER TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS INTENDED FOR BROADCAST, THE

MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES IS THE PROGRAMS RATING. PROGRAM RATINGS, WHICH ARE AN INDICATION OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, DIRECTLY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO GENERATE ADVERTISING REVENUES DURING THE AIRING

OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, TELEVISION SERIES WITH GREATER MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GENERATE INCREMENTAL

-51-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REVENUES THROUGH THE EVENTUAL SALE OF THE PROGRAM RIGHTS IN SYNDICATION. ALTERNATIVELY, POOR RATINGS MAY RESULT IN A TELEVISION SERIES CANCELLATION, WHICH

WOULD REQUIRE THE IMMEDIATE WRITE-OFF OF ANY UNAMORTIZED PRODUCTION COSTS.

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED

MOVIES, SERIES, AND OTHER PROGRAMS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED. AMORTIZATION OF THESE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ASSETS IS ACCELERATED IF WE REDUCE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS AND SLOWED IF WE INCREASE THE ESTIMATED

FUTURE AIRINGS. THE NUMBER OF FUTURE AIRINGS OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY THE PROGRAMS RATINGS IN PREVIOUS AIRINGS, EXPECTED ADVERTISING RATES, AND AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMMING. ACCORDINGLY, PLANNED

USAGE IS REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND REVISED IF NECESSARY. RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO ULTIMATE REVENUES (THE PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD)

OR ON A STRAIGHT LINE BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. GROSS REVENUES INCLUDE BOTH ADVERTISING REVENUES AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE FEES. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON OVER THE TERM OF A MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENT

APPROXIMATE EACH SEASONS RIGHTS COST BASED ON THE PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED ANNUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. IF ULTIMATE REVENUES CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PROJECTIONS, RIGHTS COSTS AMORTIZATION MAY BE

ACCELERATED OR SLOWED.

COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND PROGRAMMING RIGHTS FOR OUR BROADCAST BUSINESSES AND CABLE NETWORKS ARE

SUBJECT TO VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING RULES. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS

BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE: EARLY MORNING, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN, AND SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER

CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL. ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR

PROJECTIONS, FILM, TELEVISION, AND PROGRAMMING COST WRITE-DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ITS VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH BUSINESS. SEE NOTE 2 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THESE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES.

WE RECORD REDUCTIONS TO HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND

SOFTWARE PRODUCT REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED FUTURE RETURNS OF MERCHANDISE AND FOR CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND SALES INCENTIVES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL RETURN EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS, AND PROJECTIONS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR AND

ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD, WE MAY RECORD LESS REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS EXCEED THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT. CONVERSELY, IF WE OVERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS

AND CONCESSIONS FOR A PERIOD, WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS ARE LESS THAN ESTIMATED.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. FOR NON-EXPIRING, MULTI-DAY TICKETS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER A THREE-YEAR TIME PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE PATTERNS, WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM

HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS. A CHANGE IN THESE ESTIMATED USAGE PATTERNS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.

PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

THE COMPANYS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED

COSTS ARE CALCULATED USING ACTUARIAL CONCEPTS, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 87

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS

AND STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 106,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS,

RESPECTIVELY. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY MEASUREMENT. WE

EVALUATE THESE CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS ANNUALLY. OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE AND EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS RETIREMENT PATTERNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER, AND RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS FOR BENEFITS AS A PRESENT VALUE ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE GUIDELINE FOR SETTING

THIS RATE IS A HIGH-QUALITY LONG-TERM CORPORATE BOND RATE. A LOWER

-52-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DISCOUNT RATE INCREASES THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES PENSION EXPENSE. WE INCREASED OUR DISCOUNT RATE TO 6.40% IN 2006 FROM 5.25% IN

2005 TO REFLECT MARKET INTEREST RATE CONDITIONS AT OUR JUNE 30, 2006 MEASUREMENT DATE. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE FOR PENSION PLANS REFLECTS THE MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE

WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES. A ONE PERCENTAGE

POINT DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE TOTAL NET PERIODIC PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2007 BY $119 MILLION AND WOULD INCREASE THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT OCTOBER 1, 2006 BY

$947 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE THESE AMOUNTS BY $88 MILLION AND $780 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATION, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON EACH PLAN ASSET CLASS. A LOWER EXPECTED RATE

OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE. OUR LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.50% IN BOTH 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN THE LONG-TERM RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSET ASSUMPTION WOULD

IMPACT FISCAL 2007 ANNUAL PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $43 MILLION. SEE NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106, AND 132(R)

(SFAS 158). SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS (SFAS 142) REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND

OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IN ASSESSING THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, MARKET VALUES AND PROJECTIONS REGARDING ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND

OTHER FACTORS ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE ASSETS. IF THESE ESTIMATES OR RELATED PROJECTIONS CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR THESE ASSETS.

AS REQUIRED BY SFAS 142, GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ONE REPORTING LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. SFAS 142

REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN

IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. THE FACTOR MOST SENSITIVE TO

CHANGE WITH RESPECT TO OUR DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES IS THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF EACH REPORTING UNIT WHICH IS, IN TURN, SENSITIVE TO OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARGINS FOR THESE BUSINESSES. IF ACTUAL REVENUE GROWTH

AND/OR MARGINS ARE LOWER THAN OUR EXPECTATIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER. A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE WAS NOT USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION NETWORK, A BUSINESS WITHIN THE TELEVISION BROADCASTING REPORTING UNIT

WITHIN THE MEDIA NETWORKS OPERATING SEGMENT. TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION NETWORK, WE USED A REVENUE MULTIPLE, AS A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE WOULD NOT CAPTURE THE FULL FAIR VALUE OF THE TELEVISION NETWORK AND THERE IS LITTLE

COMPARABLE MARKET DATA AVAILABLE DUE TO THE SCARCITY OF TELEVISION NETWORKS. IF THERE WERE A PUBLICLY DISCLOSED SALE OF A COMPARABLE NETWORK, THIS MAY PROVIDE BETTER MARKET INFORMATION WITH WHICH TO ESTIMATE THE VALUE OF THE TELEVISION NETWORK AND

COULD IMPACT OUR IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT. WE APPLIED WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, THE

IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET TO

ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS, MARKET MULTIPLES, OR APPRAISED VALUES AS APPROPRIATE.

-53-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY HAS COST AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE

PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT FOR THESE INVESTMENTS, WE CONSIDER THESE FACTORS AS WELL AS FORECASTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF

OUR INVESTEES. IF THESE FORECASTS ARE NOT MET, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.

WE COMPLETED OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, WHICH RESULTED IN A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $32 MILLION RELATED TO CERTAIN FCC LICENSES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH ESPN RADIO STATIONS, REFLECTING AN OVERALL MARKET DECLINE IN CERTAIN RADIO MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

WE ARE

CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LOSSES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS. THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND ARE BASED

UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES

IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE PROCEEDINGS. SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.

INCOME TAX AUDITS

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY

IS REGULARLY AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE, AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE HAS COMMENCED ITS EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANYS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2001

THROUGH 2004. DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY SETTLED CERTAIN STATE INCOME TAX DISPUTES AND RELEASED $40 MILLION IN RELATED TAX RESERVES THAT WERE NO LONGER REQUIRED. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY REACHED SETTLEMENTS

WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE REGARDING ALL ASSESSMENTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO ITS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 1996 THROUGH 2000, AND A SETTLEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD REGARDING ASSESSMENTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO ITS

STATE TAX RETURNS FOR 1994 THROUGH 2003. THESE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENTS RESULTED IN THE COMPANY RELEASING $102 MILLION IN TAX RESERVES WHICH WERE NO LONGER REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO THE SETTLED MATTERS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, THE

FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF A TAX MATTER RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF $24 MILLION IN TAX RESERVES. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE REGARDING ALL ASSESSMENTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT

TO ITS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 1993 THROUGH 1995. THE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT RESULTED IN THE COMPANY RELEASING $120 MILLION IN TAX RESERVES THAT WERE NO LONGER REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO THE SETTLED MATTERS.

STOCK OPTION COMPENSATION EXPENSE

EACH YEAR DURING

THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY AWARDS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO A BROAD-BASED GROUP OF MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL (THE ANNUAL GRANT). PRIOR TO THE FISCAL 2006 ANNUAL GRANT, THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED WAS ESTIMATED ON

THE GRANT DATE USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL. BEGINNING WITH THE FISCAL 2006 ANNUAL GRANT, THE COMPANY HAS CHANGED TO THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL CONSIDERS CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF FAIR VALUE OPTION

PRICING THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED UNDER THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL. SIMILAR TO THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL, THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS VOLATILITY, DIVIDEND YIELD, AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE. HOWEVER, THE BINOMIAL

VALUATION MODEL ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE (THE MULTIPLE OF EXERCISE PRICE TO GRANT PRICE AT WHICH EXERCISES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON AVERAGE) AND THE TERMINATION RATE (THE PROBABILITY OF A VESTED OPTION BEING CANCELLED DUE TO THE

TERMINATION OF THE OPTION HOLDER) IN COMPUTING THE VALUE OF THE OPTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL SHOULD PRODUCE A FAIR VALUE THAT IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VALUE OF AN EMPLOYEE OPTION.

COMMENCING WITH THE 2006 ANNUAL GRANT, THE COMPANY UTILIZED THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL.

(2)

THE COMPANY UTILIZED THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL DURING FISCAL 2005 AND FISCAL 2004.

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS NOT ADJUSTED AFTER THE GRANT DATE, CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE THE

VALUE AND THEREFORE, THE EXPENSE RELATED TO FUTURE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE GREATEST VARIATION IN FAIR VALUE IN THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ARE THE ASSUMED VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE. INCREASES OR DECREASES

IN EITHER THE ASSUMED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE WILL CAUSE THE BINOMIAL OPTION VALUE TO INCREASE OR DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION FOR FISCAL 2006 AND 2005 CONSIDERS BOTH HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. VOLATILITY FOR FISCAL 2004 WAS

ESTIMATED BASED UPON HISTORICAL SHARE-PRICE VOLATILITY. SEE NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION. IF THE ASSUMED VOLATILITY OF 26% USED BY THE COMPANY DURING 2006 WAS INCREASED OR DECREASED BY 5 PERCENTAGE

POINTS (I.E. TO 31% OR TO 21%), THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE BINOMIAL VALUE OF OUR 2006 STOCK OPTION GRANTS WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY 8% OR DECREASED BY 10%, RESPECTIVELY.

THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE MAY BE INFLUENCED BY THE COMPANYS FUTURE STOCK PERFORMANCE, STOCK PRICE VOLATILITY, AND EMPLOYEE TURNOVER RATES. IF THE EXERCISE MULTIPLE ASSUMPTION OF 1.48 USED BY THE COMPANY

DURING 2006 WERE INCREASED TO 1.7 OR DECREASED TO 1.3, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE BINOMIAL VALUE OF OUR 2006 STOCK OPTION GRANTS WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY 4% OR DECREASED BY 9%, RESPECTIVELY.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OF PIXAR ON MAY 5, 2006, THE COMPANY CONVERTED PREVIOUSLY ISSUED VESTED AND UNVESTED PIXAR STOCK-BASED AWARDS

INTO DISNEY STOCK-BASED AWARDS CONSISTING OF 44 MILLION STOCK OPTIONS AND ONE MILLION RSUS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE AWARDS WAS ESTIMATED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL, AS THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO USE THE BINOMIAL VALUATION

MODEL WAS NOT REASONABLY AVAILABLE. THE METHODOLOGY UTILIZED TO DETERMINE THE ASSUMPTIONS IN THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL WAS CONSISTENT WITH THAT USED BY THE COMPANY FOR ITS OPTION PRICING MODELS.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

SAB 108

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE SEC STAFF ISSUED STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108,

CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING

MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(SAB 108). SAB 108 WAS ISSUED IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE SURROUNDING HOW PUBLIC COMPANIES QUANTIFY FINANCIAL STATEMENT MISSTATEMENTS. SAB 108 REQUIRES THAT REGISTRANTS

QUANTIFY ERRORS USING BOTH A BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME STATEMENT APPROACH AND EVALUATE WHETHER EITHER APPROACH RESULTS IN A MISSTATED AMOUNT THAT, WHEN ALL RELEVANT QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED, IS MATERIAL. SAB 108 MUST BE

IMPLEMENTED BY THE END OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL 2007. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF SAB 108 ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SFAS 158

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106, AND 132(R) (SFAS 158). THIS STATEMENT REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER

-55-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CHANGES IN THAT FUNDED STATUS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR. SFAS 158 ALSO REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF THE FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN AS OF THE DATE OF THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 158 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL 2007, WHILE THE

MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009. IF SFAS 158 WAS APPLIED AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006, USING THE COMPANYS JUNE 30, 2006 ACTUARIAL VALUATION, WE WOULD HAVE RECORDED A PRE-TAX CHARGE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TOTALING $509 MILLION ($320 MILLION AFTER TAX) REPRESENTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS BASED ON THE PROJECT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND THE AMOUNTS RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006.

SFAS 157

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE

FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

(SFAS 157). SFAS 157 PROVIDES A COMMON DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE AND ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK TO MAKE THE MEASUREMENT OF FAIR VALUE IN

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES MORE CONSISTENT AND COMPARABLE. SFAS 157 ALSO REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE IS USED TO MEASURE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE METHODS AND ASSUMPTIONS

USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE, AND THE EFFECT OF FAIR VALUE MEASURES ON EARNINGS. SFAS 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2009 FISCAL YEAR, ALTHOUGH EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF SFAS

157 ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FIN 48

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

(FIN 48). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING A MINIMUM PROBABILITY THRESHOLD THAT A TAX POSITION

MUST MEET BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED IN FIN 48 AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY

RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE

SETTLEMENT. FIN 48 MUST BE APPLIED TO ALL EXISTING TAX POSITIONS UPON INITIAL ADOPTION. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF APPLYING FIN 48 AT ADOPTION, IF ANY, IS TO BE REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS FOR THE YEAR OF ADOPTION. FIN 48 IS

EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2008 FISCAL YEAR, ALTHOUGH EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FIN 48 ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SFAS 123R

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

EMPLOYEES

(APB 25). SFAS 123R REQUIRES THAT NEW, MODIFIED, AND UNVESTED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS WITH EMPLOYEES, SUCH AS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK, BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUE AND

RECOGNIZED AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS 123R, EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2004, USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. THIS METHOD REQUIRED THE RESTATEMENT OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE YEAR OF

ADOPTION BASED ON THE AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY CALCULATED AND REPORTED IN THE PRO FORMA FOOTNOTE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY SFAS 123. HOWEVER, FISCAL YEARS PRIOR TO 2005 HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED.

EITF D-108

IN SEPTEMBER

2004, THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUED TOPIC NO. D-108,

USE OF THE RESIDUAL METHOD TO VALUE ACQUIRED ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL

(EITF D-108). EITF D-108 REQUIRES THAT A DIRECT VALUE METHOD BE USED TO VALUE INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS COMPLETED AFTER SEPTEMBER 29, 2004. EITF D-108 ALSO REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT TEST USING A DIRECT VALUE METHOD ON ALL INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY VALUED USING THE RESIDUAL METHOD.

ANY IMPAIRMENTS ARISING FROM THE INITIAL APPLICATION OF A DIRECT VALUE METHOD ARE REPORTED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE. FOR RADIO STATION ACQUISITIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF CAPITAL CITIES/ABC, INC. IN 1996, THE COMPANY

APPLIED THE RESIDUAL VALUE METHOD TO VALUE THE ACQUIRED FCC LICENSES. WE ADOPTED EITF D-108 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 1, 2005 AND RECORDED A NON-CASH, $57 MILLION PRE-TAX CHARGE ($36 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

ACCOUNTING CHANGE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FIN 46R

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 46R,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(FIN 46R). VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) ARE GENERALLY ENTITIES THAT LACK SUFFICIENT EQUITY TO FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES

WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER PARTIES OR WHOSE EQUITY HOLDERS LACK ADEQUATE DECISION MAKING ABILITY. ALL VIES WITH WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED MUST BE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF THE

VIE. THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE VIE FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF FIN

46R, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND ARE VIES AND THAT WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY BEGAN CONSOLIDATING EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS BALANCE SHEETS ON MARCH 31, 2004,

THE END OF THE COMPANYS SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, AND THE INCOME AND CASH FLOW STATEMENTS BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2004, THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. UNDER FIN 46R TRANSITION RULES, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF EURO

DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND CONTINUED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE EQUITY METHOD FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004. SEE NOTE 5 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE REST OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION AS EITHER THEY ARE NOT VIES, OR IN THE EVENT THAT THEY ARE VIES,

WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN CERTAIN OTHER VIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CONSOLIDATED BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THESE VIES DO NOT INVOLVE ANY MATERIAL EXPOSURE TO THE COMPANY.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THE

PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE WRITTEN OR ORAL STATEMENTS THAT ARE FORWARD-LOOKING, INCLUDING

STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION AND IN REPORTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. SUCH STATEMENTS MAY, FOR EXAMPLE, EXPRESS EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE ACTIONS THAT WE MAY TAKE,

INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING OR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, OR ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL INCLUDING CHANGES IN DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE MADE ON THE BASIS OF MANAGEMENTS VIEWS AND ASSUMPTIONS AS OF THE TIME

THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE THESE STATEMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WILL NECESSARILY COME TO PASS. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING THESE EXPECTATIONS ARE SET FORTH UNDER

ITEM 1A  RISK FACTORS OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, AND CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THE

COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AND THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER

OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A

PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS

TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW IN ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE

U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS, AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY

-58-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REVENUES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY

COMMITTED, TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE PRINCIPAL FOREIGN CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED

TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES GENERALLY FOR

PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES.

IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY OTHER HEDGING TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

VALUE AT RISK (VAR)

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VAR MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AND MARKET

SENSITIVE EQUITY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES WERE MADE ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED IN A VAR COMPUTATION. THE COMPANYS COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON THE

INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES, AND EQUITY PRICES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS WERE DETERMINED BY OBSERVING INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY, AND EQUITY MARKET CHANGES OVER

THE PRECEDING QUARTER FOR THE CALCULATION OF VAR AMOUNTS AT FISCAL 2006 YEAR END. THE MODEL INCLUDES ALL OF THE COMPANYS DEBT AS WELL AS ALL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH CERTAIN OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WILL BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY, NOR DOES IT

CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS.

VAR ON A COMBINED BASIS WAS $21 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006

AND OCTOBER 1, 2005.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN FAIR VALUE, CALCULATED USING THE VAR MODEL, IS AS FOLLOWS

(UNAUDITED, IN MILLIONS).

THE VAR FOR EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND IS IMMATERIAL AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. IN

CALCULATING THE VAR IT WAS DETERMINED THAT CREDIT RISKS ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF EURO DISNEYS DEBT RATHER THAN INTEREST RATE RISKS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE EXCLUDED EURO DISNEYS BORROWINGS FROM THE ABOVE VAR

CALCULATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULES 13A-15(F). THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

(I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT

MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO

,

PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR

PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND

PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON OUR EVALUATION UNDER THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK,

MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2006.

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

WE HAVE COMPLETED INTEGRATED AUDITS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). OUR OPINIONS, BASED ON OUR AUDITS, ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE WALT DISNEY

COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND OCTOBER 1, 2005, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 IN CONFORMITY WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR

AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF THESE STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT

WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, DURING THE YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 1, 2005, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT VALUES ITS FCC

LICENSES AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS FOR STOCK COMPENSATION COSTS. ALSO, DURING THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT EVALUATES WHETHER VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES SHOULD BE CONSOLIDATED AND,

ACCORDINGLY, BEGAN CONSOLIDATING EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND AS OF MARCH 31, 2004.

REPORTING APPEARING UNDER THIS ITEM 15, THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY

THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO), IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA. FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COSO. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES

OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL,

-70-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE

RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT

AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF

ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

REPRESENTS 100% OF EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND DEPRECIATION EXPENSE FOR ALL PERIODS BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2004. HONG KONG

DISNEYLANDS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALED $95 MILLION, $591 MILLION, AND $251 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2006, 2005, AND 2004 RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN FISCAL 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INVESTMENT AT HONG KONG

DISNEYLAND RESULTING FROM THE SUBSTANTIAL COMPLETION OF THE PARK PRIOR TO ITS OPENING IN SEPTEMBER 2005, WHEREAS FISCAL 2004 INCLUDED ONLY SIX MONTHS OF ACTIVITY. OUR EQUITY PARTNER CONTRIBUTED $47 MILLION, $147 MILLION, AND $66 MILLION, WHICH ARE

INCLUDED AS SOURCES OF CASH IN FINANCING ACTIVITIES, IN FISCAL 2006, 2005, AND THE SECOND HALF OF FISCAL 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES

OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES AFTER ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS. IN DECEMBER 1999, DVD FINANCING, INC. (DFI), A SUBSIDIARY OF DISNEY VACATION DEVELOPMENT, INC. AND AN INDIRECT SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, COMPLETED A RECEIVABLE SALE

TRANSACTION THAT ESTABLISHED A FACILITY THAT PERMITS DFI TO SELL RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE SALE OF VACATION CLUB MEMBERSHIPS ON A PERIODIC BASIS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS FACILITY, DFI PREPARES SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH ITS SEPARATE

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE ALSO CONSOLIDATED IN THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

SAB 108

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE SEC STAFF ISSUED

STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 108,

CONSIDERING THE EFFECTS OF PRIOR YEAR MISSTATEMENTS WHEN QUANTIFYING MISSTATEMENTS IN CURRENT YEAR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

(SAB 108). SAB 108 WAS ISSUED IN ORDER TO ELIMINATE THE DIVERSITY IN PRACTICE

SURROUNDING HOW PUBLIC COMPANIES QUANTIFY FINANCIAL STATEMENT MISSTATEMENTS. SAB 108 REQUIRES THAT REGISTRANTS QUANTIFY ERRORS USING BOTH A BALANCE SHEET AND INCOME STATEMENT APPROACH AND EVALUATE WHETHER EITHER APPROACH RESULTS IN A MISSTATED

AMOUNT THAT, WHEN ALL RELEVANT QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE FACTORS ARE CONSIDERED, IS MATERIAL. SAB 108 MUST BE IMPLEMENTED BY THE END OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL 2007. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF SAB 108 ON ITS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SFAS 158

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106, AND 132(R) (SFAS 158). THIS STATEMENT

REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF THE OVERFUNDED OR UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND CHANGES IN THAT FUNDED STATUS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR. SFAS 158 ALSO REQUIRES MEASUREMENT OF THE FUNDED STATUS OF A PLAN AS OF THE DATE OF THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF SFAS 158 ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL

2007, WHILE THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS ARE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009. IF SFAS 158 WAS APPLIED AT THE END OF FISCAL 2006, USING THE COMPANYS JUNE 30, 2006 ACTUARIAL VALUATION, WE WOULD HAVE RECORDED A PRE-TAX CHARGE TO

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TOTALING $509 MILLION ($320 MILLION AFTER TAX) REPRESENTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS BASED ON THE PROJECT BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND THE AMOUNTS RECORDED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AT

SEPTEMBER 30, 2006.

SFAS 157

IN

SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

(SFAS 157). SFAS 157 PROVIDES A COMMON DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE AND ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK TO MAKE THE MEASUREMENT OF

FAIR VALUE IN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES MORE CONSISTENT AND COMPARABLE. SFAS 157 ALSO REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES TO PROVIDE INFORMATION ABOUT THE EXTENT TO WHICH FAIR VALUE IS USED TO MEASURE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE METHODS AND

ASSUMPTIONS USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE, AND THE EFFECT OF FAIR VALUE MEASURES ON EARNINGS. SFAS 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2009 FISCAL YEAR, ALTHOUGH EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL

EFFECT OF SFAS 157 ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FIN 48

IN JULY 2006, THE FASB ISSUED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

(FIN 48). FIN 48 CLARIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES BY PRESCRIBING A MINIMUM PROBABILITY

THRESHOLD THAT A TAX POSITION MUST MEET BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED IN FIN 48 AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING

AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN FIFTY PERCENT LIKELY OF

BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. FIN 48 MUST BE APPLIED TO ALL EXISTING TAX POSITIONS UPON INITIAL ADOPTION. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF APPLYING FIN 48 AT ADOPTION, IF ANY, IS TO BE REPORTED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS FOR

THE YEAR OF ADOPTION. FIN 48 IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE COMPANYS 2008 FISCAL YEAR, ALTHOUGH EARLY ADOPTION IS PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FIN 48 ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SFAS 123R

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, THE

COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123R,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(SFAS 123R), WHICH REVISES SFAS 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

AND SUPERSEDES ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

(APB 25). SFAS 123R REQUIRES THAT NEW, MODIFIED AND UNVESTED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS WITH EMPLOYEES, SUCH AS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK, BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED

ON THEIR FAIR VALUE AND RECOGNIZED AS COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS 123R EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2004, USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. THIS METHOD REQUIRED THE RESTATEMENT OF INTERIM FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN THE YEAR OF ADOPTION BASED ON THE AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY CALCULATED AND REPORTED IN THE PRO FORMA FOOTNOTE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY SFAS 123. HOWEVER, FISCAL YEARS PRIOR TO 2005 HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED.

COSTS. CAPITALIZED STOCK OPTION COMPENSATION TOTALED $52 MILLION AND $18 MILLION IN 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

PRIOR TO

FISCAL 2005, EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS WERE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH APB 25 AND ITS RELATED INTERPRETATIONS, AND WERE GENERALLY GRANTED AT MARKET VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR STOCK OPTION AWARDS

WAS GENERALLY NOT RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE FOLLOWING TABLE REFLECTS PRO FORMA NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, HAD THE COMPANY ELECTED TO ADOPT THE FAIR VALUE APPROACH OF

SFAS 123 AS REPORTED IN THE FOOTNOTES TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THAT YEAR. THE PRO FORMA AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE DISCLOSURES SINCE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS AMORTIZED TO EXPENSE OVER THE

VESTING PERIOD AND ADDITIONAL OPTIONS MAY BE GRANTED OR OPTIONS MAY BE CANCELLED IN FUTURE YEARS.

TRANSITION METHOD PROVIDED IN THE FASB STAFF POSITION FOR CALCULATING THE TAX EFFECTS OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PURSUANT TO SFAS 123(R). THE ALTERNATIVE

TRANSITION METHOD INCLUDES COMPUTATIONAL GUIDANCE TO ESTABLISH THE BEGINNING BALANCE OF THE ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL POOL (APIC POOL) RELATED TO THE TAX EFFECTS OF EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND A SIMPLIFIED METHOD TO DETERMINE THE

SUBSEQUENT IMPACT ON THE APIC POOL FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS THAT ARE VESTED AND OUTSTANDING UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS 123(R).

EITF

D-108

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) ISSUED TOPIC NO. D-108,

USE OF THE RESIDUAL METHOD TO VALUE ACQUIRED

ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL

(EITF D-108). EITF D-108 REQUIRES THAT A DIRECT VALUE METHOD BE USED TO VALUE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS COMPLETED AFTER SEPTEMBER 29, 2004. EITF D-108 ALSO REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO PERFORM

AN IMPAIRMENT TEST USING A DIRECT VALUE METHOD ON ALL INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY VALUED USING THE RESIDUAL METHOD. ANY IMPAIRMENTS ARISING FROM THE INITIAL APPLICATION OF A DIRECT VALUE METHOD ARE REPORTED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

ACCOUNTING CHANGE. FOR RADIO STATION ACQUISITIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF CAPITAL CITIES/ABC, INC. IN 1996, THE COMPANY APPLIED THE RESIDUAL VALUE METHOD TO VALUE THE ACQUIRED FCC LICENSES. WE ADOPTED EITF D-108 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED

OCTOBER 1, 2005 AND RECORDED A NON-CASH, $57 MILLION PRE-TAX CHARGE ($36 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE.

FIN 46R

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 46R,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(FIN 46R). VARIABLE

INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) ARE GENERALLY ENTITIES THAT LACK SUFFICIENT EQUITY TO FINANCE THEIR ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER PARTIES OR WHOSE EQUITY HOLDERS LACK ADEQUATE DECISION MAKING ABILITY. ALL VIES WITH WHICH THE

COMPANY IS INVOLVED MUST BE EVALUATED TO DETERMINE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF THE VIE. THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IS REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE VIE FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46R, THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND ARE VIES AND THAT WE ARE THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY BEGAN CONSOLIDATING EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLANDS BALANCE SHEETS ON MARCH 31, 2004, THE END OF THE COMPANYS SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, AND THE INCOME AND CASH FLOW STATEMENTS

BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2004, THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. UNDER FIN 46R TRANSITION RULES, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND CONTINUED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON THE EQUITY METHOD FOR THE SIX MONTHS

ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 (SEE NOTE 5).

WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE REST OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION AS EITHER

THEY ARE NOT VIES, OR IN THE EVENT THAT THEY ARE VIES, WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN CERTAIN OTHER VIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CONSOLIDATED BECAUSE THE COMPANY IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THESE VIES

DO NOT INVOLVE ANY MATERIAL EXPOSURE TO THE COMPANY.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE FISCAL 2005 AND FISCAL 2004 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND NOTES TO CONFORM TO THE FISCAL 2006 PRESENTATION.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FOOTNOTES THERETO. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM

THOSE ESTIMATES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

BROADCAST ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN COMMERCIALS ARE AIRED. REVENUES FROM TELEVISION SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS PRIMARY CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. CERTAIN OF

THE COMPANYS CONTRACTS WITH CABLE SERVICE PROVIDERS INCLUDE ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS. IN THESE CASES, REVENUE SUBJECT TO THE COMMITMENT, THAT IS GENERALLY COLLECTED RATABLY OVER THE YEAR IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE ANNUAL COMMITMENTS ARE

SATISFIED, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET

SALES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. FOR NON-EXPIRING, MULTI-DAY TICKETS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER A THREE-YEAR TIME PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE PATTERNS THAT ARE

-83-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS. REVENUES FROM CORPORATE SPONSORS AT THE THEME PARKS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD OF THE APPLICABLE

AGREEMENTS COMMENCING WITH THE OPENING OF THE RELATED ATTRACTION.

REVENUES FROM THE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION OF MOTION PICTURES ARE

RECOGNIZED WHEN MOTION PICTURES ARE EXHIBITED. REVENUES FROM VIDEO AND VIDEO GAME SALES, NET OF ANTICIPATED RETURNS AND CUSTOMER INCENTIVES, ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE DATE THAT VIDEO UNITS ARE MADE AVAILABLE FOR SALE BY RETAILERS. REVENUES FROM THE

LICENSING OF FEATURE FILMS AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ARE RECORDED WHEN THE MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE FOR TELECASTING BY THE LICENSEE AND WHEN CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS ARE MET.

MERCHANDISE LICENSING ADVANCES AND GUARANTEE ROYALTY PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE CONTRACTUAL ROYALTY RATE WHEN THE LICENSED PRODUCT IS SOLD BY

THE LICENSEE. NON-REFUNDABLE ADVANCES AND MINIMUM GUARANTEE ROYALTY PAYMENTS IN EXCESS OF ROYALTIES EARNED ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE AT THE END OF THE CONTRACT TERM.

ADVERTISING EXPENSE

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE INCURRED FOR

FISCAL 2006, 2005, AND 2004 TOTALED $2.5 BILLION, $2.9 BILLION, AND $3.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH ON HAND AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS.

INVESTMENTS

DEBT SECURITIES THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE

POSITIVE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND REPORTED AT AMORTIZED COST. DEBT SECURITIES NOT CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER

TRADING OR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, AND ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN EARNINGS OR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, RESPECTIVELY. ALL OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING EITHER THE

COST METHOD OR THE EQUITY METHOD.

THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW THE

COST BASIS IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. IF THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE WRITE-DOWN IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

INCOME.

TRANSLATION POLICY

THE U.S.

DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR EURO DISNEY, HONG KONG DISNEYLAND, AND INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS OF THE DISNEY STORES.

FOR U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY LOCATIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REMEASURED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES,

EXCEPT FOR NONMONETARY BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING EACH PERIOD, EXCEPT FOR THOSE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE PREVIOUSLY NOTED

BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT ARE INCLUDED IN NET EARNINGS.

FOR LOCAL CURRENCY FUNCTIONAL LOCATIONS, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED AT END-OF-PERIOD RATES WHILE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD. EQUITY IS TRANSLATED AT

HISTORICAL RATES AND THE RESULTING CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI).

INVENTORIES

CARRYING AMOUNTS OF MERCHANDISE, MATERIALS, AND SUPPLIES INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A MOVING

AVERAGE COST BASIS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS INCLUDE CAPITALIZABLE DIRECT NEGATIVE COSTS, PRODUCTION OVERHEAD, INTEREST, DEVELOPMENT COSTS, AND ACQUIRED PRODUCTION COSTS AND

ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR FAIR VALUE.

-84-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACQUIRED PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR THE COMPANYS TELEVISION AND CABLE/SATELLITE NETWORKS ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR

NET REALIZABLE VALUE. ACQUIRED TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE RECORDED WHEN THE LICENSE PERIOD BEGINS AND THE PROGRAM IS AVAILABLE FOR USE. MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, AND GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND PARTICIPATION COSTS ARE EXPENSED BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO

ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS REVENUES (PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD) FROM ALL SOURCES ON AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION BASIS. ESTIMATED REMAINING GROSS REVENUE FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS INCLUDES REVENUE THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DATE OF THE

INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR ACQUIRED FILM LIBRARIES, REMAINING REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO BE EARNED FOR UP TO TWENTY YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED OR HAVE NOT BEEN SET FOR PRODUCTION

WITHIN THREE YEARS ARE GENERALLY WRITTEN OFF.

TELEVISION NETWORK SERIES COSTS AND MULTI-YEAR SPORTS RIGHTS ARE AMORTIZED UNDER THE

PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD BASED ON REVENUES FROM SUCH PROGRAMS OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. FOR TELEVISION NETWORK SERIES, WE INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN

PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER. FOR DETERMINING MULTI-YEAR SPORTS RIGHTS COSTS, GROSS REVENUES INCLUDE BOTH ADVERTISING REVENUES AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE FEES. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL

PAYMENTS OVER THE TERM OF A MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENT APPROXIMATE THE RIGHTS COST BASED ON THE PROJECTED REVENUE METHOD, WE EXPENSE THE ANNUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE SEASON. TELEVISION NETWORK AND STATION RIGHTS FOR THEATRICAL MOVIES

AND OTHER LONG-FORM PROGRAMMING ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE PRIMARILY ON AN ACCELERATED BASIS RELATED TO THE PROJECTED USAGE OF THE PROGRAMS.

ESTIMATES OF TOTAL GROSS REVENUES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ADVERTISING RATES AND THE LEVEL OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCTION. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND

AMORTIZATION IS ADJUSTED, IF NECESSARY. SUCH ADJUSTMENTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF NETWORK TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS IS REVIEWED USING A DAYPART

METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE EARLY MORNING, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN, AND SPORTS

(INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL.

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE COSTS

THE COMPANY EXPENSES COSTS INCURRED IN THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE OF DEVELOPING OR ACQUIRING

INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE, SUCH AS RESEARCH AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES, AS WELL AS COSTS INCURRED IN THE POST-IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONAL STAGE, SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING. CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS OCCURS ONLY AFTER THE

PRELIMINARY-PROJECT STAGE IS COMPLETE, MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZES THE PROJECT, AND IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETED AND THE SOFTWARE WILL BE USED FOR THE FUNCTION INTENDED. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND OCTOBER 1, 2005,

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS TOTALED $491 MILLION AND $483 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE, RANGING FROM 3-10 YEARS.

SOFTWARE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS

SOFTWARE PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT COSTS INCURRED PRIOR TO REACHING TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY ARE EXPENSED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF THE SOFTWARE IS NOT ESTABLISHED UNTIL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT IS COMPLETE. THE SOFTWARE PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT COSTS THAT HAVE BEEN CAPITALIZED TO DATE HAVE BEEN INSIGNIFICANT.

PARKS, RESORTS AND OTHER PROPERTY

PARKS, RESORTS, AND OTHER PROPERTY ARE CARRIED AT HISTORICAL COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED ON THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AS

FOLLOWS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST AT FISCAL YEAR END FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INCLUDING FCC LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS. AS REQUIRED BY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(SFAS 142), GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY ONE LEVEL BELOW OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS.

TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT, SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING

AMOUNT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS

GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW)

CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE, EXCEPT FOR THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, A BUSINESS WITHIN THE MEDIA NETWORKS OPERATING SEGMENT, FOR WHICH WE USED A REVENUE MULTIPLE. WE DID NOT USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE OR A

MARKET MULTIPLE APPROACH TO VALUE THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AS A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE WOULD NOT CAPTURE ITS FULL FAIR VALUE AND THERE IS LITTLE COMPARABLE MARKET DATA AVAILABLE DUE TO THE SCARCITY OF TELEVISION NETWORKS. WE APPLIED WHAT WE

BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, MARKET MULTIPLES, OR APPRAISED VALUES,

AS APPROPRIATE.

WE COMPLETED OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, WHICH RESULTED IN A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $32

MILLION RELATED TO CERTAIN FCC LICENSES, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH ESPN RADIO STATIONS, REFLECTING AN OVERALL MARKET DECLINE IN CERTAIN RADIO MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE.

AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PRINCIPALLY COPYRIGHTS, ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER PERIODS RANGING FROM 10  31 YEARS.

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS; FORWARD, OPTION AND

SWAPTION CONTRACTS AND INTEREST RATE CAPS.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND

HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR UNDERTAKING VARIOUS HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DERIVATIVES INTO WHICH THE COMPANY ENTERS: HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AND HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE.

HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED ASSET, LIABILITY, OR A FIRM COMMITMENT. HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION (E.G. FORECASTED

REVENUE) OR THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED, RELATED TO A RECOGNIZED LIABILITY OR ASSET (E.G. FLOATING RATE DEBT).

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES AND ASSIGNS THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFIC ASSETS, OR SPECIFIC LIABILITIES. WHEN HEDGED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE SOLD OR EXTINGUISHED OR THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS BEING

HEDGED ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED HEDGING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OPTION

PREMIUMS AND UNREALIZED GAINS ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS OTHER ASSETS. UNREALIZED LOSSES ON FORWARD CONTRACTS

AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PAID UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LIABILITIES. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES THE DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS AS INTEREST RATES AND EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST

EXPENSE OVER THE LIVES OF THE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE TERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE SWAP AGREEMENTS, PRIOR TO THEIR ORIGINAL MATURITY, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE

ACCOUNTING. THESE CONTRACTS ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET CERTAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURES OF THE COMPANY AND ARE CARRIED AT MARKET VALUE WITH ANY CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (SEE NOTES 7 AND 13).

EARNINGS PER SHARE

THE COMPANY PRESENTS BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AMOUNTS. BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY

DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EPS IS BASED UPON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR WHICH IS CALCULATED USING THE

TREASURY-STOCK METHOD FOR STOCK OPTIONS AND ASSUMES CONVERSION OF THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES (SEE NOTE 7). COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION IN PERIODS IN WHICH THEY HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT. STOCK

OPTIONS FOR WHICH THE EXERCISE PRICE EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OVER THE PERIOD ARE ANTI-DILUTIVE AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION.

A RECONCILIATION OF NET INCOME AND THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR CALCULATING DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS AS FOLLOWS.

SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

ACQUISITION OF PIXAR

ON MAY 5, 2006 (THE CLOSING DATE), THE COMPANY COMPLETED AN ALL STOCK

ACQUISITION OF PIXAR, A DIGITAL ANIMATION STUDIO (THE ACQUISITION). DISNEY BELIEVES THAT THE CREATION OF HIGH QUALITY FEATURE ANIMATION IS A KEY DRIVER OF SUCCESS ACROSS MANY OF ITS BUSINESSES AND PROVIDES CONTENT USEFUL ACROSS A VARIETY OF

TRADITIONAL AND NEW PLATFORMS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE ACQUISITION OF PIXAR IS INTENDED TO SUPPORT THE COMPANYS STRATEGIC PRIORITIES OF CREATING THE FINEST CONTENT, EMBRACING LEADING-EDGE TECHNOLOGIES, AND STRENGTHENING ITS GLOBAL PRESENCE.

THE RESULTS OF PIXARS OPERATIONS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS SINCE THE CLOSING DATE.

TO PURCHASE PIXAR, DISNEY EXCHANGED 2.3 SHARES OF ITS COMMON STOCK FOR EACH SHARE OF PIXAR COMMON STOCK, RESULTING IN THE ISSUANCE OF 279 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK, AND CONVERTED PREVIOUSLY ISSUED VESTED AND UNVESTED PIXAR

EQUITY-BASED AWARDS INTO APPROXIMATELY 45 MILLION DISNEY EQUITY-BASED AWARDS.

-87-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ACQUISITION PURCHASE PRICE WAS $7.5 BILLION ($6.4 BILLION, NET OF PIXARS CASH AND INVESTMENTS

OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION). THE VALUE OF THE STOCK ISSUED WAS CALCULATED BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK USING THE AVERAGE STOCK PRICE FOR THE FIVE-DAY PERIOD BEGINNING TWO DAYS BEFORE THE ACQUISITION ANNOUNCEMENT

DATE ON JANUARY 24, 2006. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE VESTED EQUITY-BASED AWARDS ISSUED AT THE CLOSING DATE WAS ESTIMATED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING MODEL, AS THE INFORMATION REQUIRED TO USE A BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL WAS NOT REASONABLY

AVAILABLE.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NON-CASH, NON-TAXABLE GAIN FROM THE DEEMED TERMINATION OF THE

EXISTING PIXAR DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT. UNDER OUR PREVIOUSLY EXISTING DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT WITH PIXAR, THE COMPANY EARNED A DISTRIBUTION FEE THAT, BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RATES AT THE CLOSING DATE, WAS FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY. IN ACCORDANCE WITH

EITF 04-1,

ACCOUNTING FOR PRE-EXISTING RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN THE PARTIES TO A BUSINESS COMBINATION

(EITF 04-1), THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A $48 MILLION GAIN, REPRESENTING THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE FAVORABLE PORTION OF THE DISTRIBUTION FEE

OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY ABANDONED THE PIXAR SEQUEL PROJECTS COMMENCED BY THE COMPANY PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION AND RECORDED A PRE-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE TOTALING $26 MILLION, WHICH REPRESENTS THE

COSTS OF THESE PROJECTS INCURRED THROUGH THE ABANDONMENT DATE. THESE TWO ITEMS ARE CLASSIFIED IN RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT (CHARGES) AND OTHER CREDITS, NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME.

THE COMPANY ALLOCATED THE PURCHASE PRICE TO THE TANGIBLE AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES,

WHICH WERE DETERMINED PRIMARILY THROUGH THIRD-PARTY APPRAISALS. THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THOSE FAIR VALUES WAS RECORDED AS GOODWILL, WHICH IS NOT AMORTIZABLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE FAIR VALUES SET FORTH BELOW ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT IF

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION IS OBTAINED PRIOR TO THE ONE-YEAR ANNIVERSARY OF THE ACQUISITION THAT WOULD CHANGE THE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE.

ABC RADIO TRANSACTION

ON FEBRUARY 6, 2006, THE COMPANY AND CITADEL BROADCASTING CORPORATION (CITADEL) ANNOUNCED AN AGREEMENT TO MERGE THE ABC RADIO BUSINESS, WHICH CONSISTS OF 22 OF THE COMPANYS OWNED RADIO STATIONS AND THE ABC

RADIO NETWORK, WITH CITADEL. THE ESPN RADIO AND RADIO DISNEY NETWORKS AND STATION BUSINESSES ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TRANSACTION. THE MERGER IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR AFTER THE ABC RADIO BUSINESS IS DISTRIBUTED TO DISNEY SHAREHOLDERS (THE DISTRIBUTION).

THE AGREEMENT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY AMENDED ON NOVEMBER 19, 2006. UNDER THE AMENDED TERMS, (I) DISNEYS STOCKHOLDERS ARE EXPECTED TO COLLECTIVELY HOLD APPROXIMATELY 57% OF CITADELS COMMON STOCK POST-MERGER, AND (II) THE COMPANY WOULD RETAIN

BETWEEN $1.10 BILLION AND $1.35 BILLION IN CASH, DEPENDING UPON THE MARKET PRICE OF CITADELS COMMON STOCK OVER A MEASUREMENT PERIOD ENDING PRIOR TO THE CLOSING. THIS CASH WILL BE OBTAINED FROM LOAN PROCEEDS RAISED BY ABC RADIO FROM A THIRD

PARTY LENDER PRIOR TO THE DISTRIBUTION. BASED ON CITADELS STOCK PRICE ON NOVEMBER 20, 2006, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THE AGGREGATE VALUE OF THE RETAINED CASH AND CITADEL COMMON STOCK TO BE RECEIVED BY DISNEY SHAREHOLDERS WOULD BE

APPROXIMATELY $2.5 BILLION. THE AMENDED AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT THE CLOSING WILL OCCUR NO EARLIER THAN MAY 31, 2007, SUBJECT TO REGULATORY APPROVALS, AND THAT EITHER PARTY MAY TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT IF THE CLOSING DOES NOT OCCUR BY JUNE 15, 2007.

INVESTMENT IN AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASES

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $101 MILLION PRE-TAX

CHARGE, OR $0.03 PER SHARE, TO WRITE-OFF ITS REMAINING INVESTMENT IN AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASES WITH DELTA AIR LINES, INC. (DELTA) RESULTING FROM DELTAS BANKRUPTCY FILING IN SEPTEMBER 2005. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY

RECORDED A $16 MILLION PRE-TAX CHARGE TO WRITE DOWN ITS LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT IN DELTA CONSISTENT WITH OUR AGREEMENT WITH DELTA TO REDUCE LEASE PAYMENTS. THESE CHARGES WERE REPORTED IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME. BASED ON DELTAS BANKRUPTCY FILING, WE BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL RECOVER THESE INVESTMENTS. IN THE EVENT OF A MATERIAL MODIFICATION TO THE DELTA AIRCRAFT LEASES OR FORECLOSURE OF THE REMAINING DELTA

AIRCRAFT BY THE DEBT HOLDERS, CERTAIN TAX PAYMENTS OF UP TO $40 MILLION, AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, COULD BE ACCELERATED. THE EXPECTED TAX PAYMENTS ARE CURRENTLY REFLECTED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AS A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO

RESULT IN A FURTHER CHARGE TO EARNINGS. OUR REMAINING AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT OF $52 MILLION IS WITH FEDEX CORP.

WITH EURO DISNEY ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME PAYMENT TERMS. THESE LEASE TRANSACTIONS WERE ELIMINATED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES UPON CONSOLIDATION OF EURO DISNEY BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 46R.

2005 FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS OVERALL EFFECTIVE OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN DISNEYLAND RESORT PARIS OPERATIONS FROM 41% TO 51%. PURSUANT TO THE MOA, THE COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN AT LEAST A DIRECT 39% OWNERSHIP INVESTMENT IN

EURO DISNEY THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2016.

IN 2006 THE COMPANY DERIVED TAX BENEFITS OF $118 MILLION FROM AN EXCLUSION PROVIDED UNDER U.S.

INCOME TAX LAWS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO FOREIGN TRADING GROSS RECEIPTS (FTGRS). THIS EXCLUSION WAS REPEALED AS PART OF THE

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

(THE ACT), WHICH WAS ENACTED ON

OCTOBER 22, 2004. THE ACT PROVIDES FOR A PHASE-OUT SUCH THAT THE EXCLUSION FOR THE COMPANYS OTHERWISE QUALIFYING FTGRS GENERATED IN FISCAL 2005, 2006, AND 2007 WILL BE LIMITED TO APPROXIMATELY 85%, 65%, AND 15% OF THE EXCLUSION,

RESPECTIVELY. NO EXCLUSION WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR TRANSACTIONS ORIGINATING AFTER THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2007.

-100-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ACT ALSO PROVIDED FOR A ONE-TIME TAX DEDUCTION OF 85% OF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT WERE

REPATRIATED IN FISCAL 2005. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED FOREIGN EARNINGS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS DEDUCTION AND RECORDED A TAX BENEFIT OF $32 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE REVERSAL OF DEFERRED TAXES PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED ON

THESE EARNINGS.

THE ACT MADE A NUMBER OF OTHER CHANGES TO THE INCOME TAX LAWS INCLUDING THE CREATION OF A NEW DEDUCTION RELATING TO

QUALIFYING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES WHICH WILL AFFECT THE COMPANY IN THE CURRENT AND FUTURE YEARS. THE DEDUCTION EQUALS THREE PERCENT OF QUALIFYING NET INCOME FOR FISCAL 2006 AND 2007, SIX PERCENT FOR FISCAL 2008 THROUGH 2010, AND NINE PERCENT

FOR FISCAL 2011 AND THEREAFTER. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY AND THE IRS ISSUED FINAL REGULATIONS ON MAY 25, 2006 WHICH PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE RULES, DEFINITIONS, AND EXAMPLES TO ASSIST IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS NEW DEDUCTION. THE

COMPANY HAS ANALYZED THE FINAL REGULATIONS AND ANTICIPATES THE ISSUANCE OF FURTHER GUIDANCE RELEVANT TO THE CALCULATION OF THE COMPANYS TAX BENEFIT. BASED ON EXISTING GUIDANCE, OUR TAX PROVISION FOR FISCAL 2006 REFLECTS AN ESTIMATED BENEFIT OF

$25 MILLION.

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME,

THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE HAS COMMENCED ITS EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANYS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2001 THROUGH 2004. DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY SETTLED CERTAIN STATE INCOME TAX DISPUTES

AND RELEASED $40 MILLION IN RELATED TAX RESERVES THAT WERE NO LONGER REQUIRED. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY REACHED SETTLEMENTS WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE REGARDING ALL ASSESSMENTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO ITS FEDERAL

INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 1996 THROUGH 2000, AND A SETTLEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD REGARDING ASSESSMENTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO ITS STATE TAX RETURNS FOR 1994 THROUGH 2003. THESE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENTS RESULTED IN THE COMPANY

RELEASING $102 MILLION IN TAX RESERVES WHICH WERE NO LONGER REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO THE SETTLED MATTERS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF A TAX MATTER RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF $24 MILLION IN TAX RESERVES.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE REGARDING ALL ASSESSMENTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO ITS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 1993 THROUGH 1995. THE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT RESULTED

IN THE COMPANY RELEASING $120 MILLION IN TAX RESERVES THAT WERE NO LONGER REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO THE SETTLED MATTERS.

IN FISCAL YEARS

2006, 2005 AND 2004, INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS THAT WERE ALLOCATED TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AMOUNTED TO $106 MILLION, $64 MILLION AND $25 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT OCTOBER 1, 2005 WERE REDUCED BY A $74 MILLION VALUATION ALLOWANCE, OF WHICH $24 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN ACQUIRED

NET OPERATING LOSSES. DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY DETERMINED THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE ACQUIRED NET OPERATING LOSSES COULD BE UTILIZED WITH RESPECT TO OUR FISCAL 2005 TAX RETURNS RESULTING IN A $20 MILLION REDUCTION IN CURRENT TAXES

PAYABLE. THE REALIZATION OF THIS TAX BENEFIT RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN THE RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCE AND A CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENT BEING APPLIED AS A REDUCTION TO GOODWILL.

PENSION AND OTHER BENEFIT PROGRAMS

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS PENSION PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS COVERING MOST OF ITS DOMESTIC EMPLOYEES NOT COVERED BY UNION OR

INDUSTRY-WIDE PLANS. EMPLOYEES HIRED AFTER JANUARY 1, 1994 AND ABC EMPLOYEES GENERALLY HIRED AFTER JANUARY 1, 1987 ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. WITH RESPECT TO ITS QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, THE

COMPANYS POLICY IS TO FUND, AT A MINIMUM, THE AMOUNT NECESSARY ON AN ACTUARIAL BASIS TO PROVIDE FOR BENEFITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT OF 1974. PENSION BENEFITS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON

YEARS OF SERVICE AND/OR COMPENSATION. THE FOLLOWING CHART SUMMARIZES THE BALANCE SHEET IMPACT, AS WELL AS THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS, ASSETS, FUNDED STATUS AND RATE ASSUMPTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS BASED

UPON THE ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS PREPARED AS OF JUNE 30, 2006 AND 2005 (THE PLAN MEASUREMENT DATES).

PLAN FUNDED STATUS

A NUMBER OF THE COMPANYS PENSION PLANS WERE UNDERFUNDED AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, HAVING ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS EXCEEDING THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS. FOR THESE PLANS, THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS

AGGREGATED $1.6 BILLION, THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AGGREGATED $1.9 BILLION, AND THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AGGREGATED

-102-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

$2.1 BILLION. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED AN ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT OF $197 MILLION AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. THE

ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT AT OCTOBER 1, 2005 WAS $1.1 BILLION. THE DECREASE IN THE ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT OF $927 MILLION ($585 MILLION AFTER TAX) IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO AN

INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FROM 5.25% AT OCTOBER 1, 2005 TO 6.40% AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006. THE CHANGE IN THE ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY WAS RECORDED AS A DIRECT INCREASE IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

THE COMPANYS TOTAL ACCUMULATED PENSION BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND OCTOBER 1, 2005

WERE $4.4 BILLION AND $4.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH 96.1% AND 97.3%, RESPECTIVELY, WERE VESTED.

THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS FOR POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS WITH ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS IN EXCESS OF PLAN ASSETS WERE $936 MILLION AND $317 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT SEPTEMBER 30,

2006 AND $1.2 BILLION AND $260 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT OCTOBER 1, 2005.

PLAN ASSETS

THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE MANAGED ON A COMMINGLED BASIS IN A THIRD PARTY MASTER TRUST. THE INVESTMENT POLICY AND

ALLOCATION OF THE ASSETS IN THE MASTER TRUST WERE APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE, WHICH HAS OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMPANYS RETIREMENT PLANS. THE INVESTMENT POLICY RANGES FOR THE MAJOR ASSET

THE CASH

ALLOCATION EXCEEDED THE POLICY RANGE LIMIT ON JUNE 30, 2006, DUE TO A $314 MILLION EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTION INTO THE PLANS IN JUNE 2006, WHICH IS BEING INVESTED THROUGH DECEMBER 2006 USING THE DOLLAR COST AVERAGING METHOD.

PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS

DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY

CONTRIBUTED $367 MILLION AND $33 MILLION TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH INCLUDED VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PENSION PLANS. BASED ON THE JANUARY 1, 2006 FUNDING VALUATION,

THE COMPANY IS NOT REQUIRED TO MAKE ANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLANS DURING FISCAL 2007. THE COMPANY MAY MAKE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS INTO ITS PENSION PLANS IN FISCAL 2007 DEPENDING ON HOW THE FUNDED STATUS OF THOSE PLANS CHANGE AND AS WE

GAIN MORE CLARITY WITH RESPECT TO THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT OF 2006 (PPA) THAT WAS SIGNED INTO LAW ON AUGUST 17, 2006. THE UNITED STATES TREASURY DEPARTMENT IS IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPING IMPLEMENTATION GUIDANCE FOR THE PPA; HOWEVER, IT IS

LIKELY THE PPA WILL ACCELERATE MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2009. THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE TO PRE-FUND SOME OF THIS ANTICIPATED FUNDING.

ASSUMPTIONS

CERTAIN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS THE DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST AS

WELL AS THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AMOUNTS.

DISCOUNT RATE

 THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE FOR PENSION PLANS REFLECTS THE

MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING

DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

 THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM RETURNS ON AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTING OF A MIXTURE OF EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME, AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS. WHEN DETERMINING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN

ON PLAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON THE ASSET CLASSES (BOTH HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED) IN WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE PENSION FUNDS TO BE INVESTED. THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN BY ASSET CLASS WERE

CONSIDERED IN SETTING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION.

EQUITY SECURITIES

8 %  10 %

DEBT SECURITIES

4 %    7 %

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS

8 %  20 %

HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE

 THE COMPANY REVIEWS EXTERNAL DATA AND ITS OWN HISTORICAL

TRENDS FOR HEALTHCARE COSTS TO DETERMINE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATES FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS. FOR THE 2006 ACTUARIAL VALUATION, WE ASSUMED A 9.0% ANNUAL RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED HEALTHCARE CLAIMS

WITH THE RATE DECREASING IN EVEN INCREMENTS OVER FIVE YEARS UNTIL REACHING 5.0%.

A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT (PPT) CHANGE IN THE KEY

ASSUMPTIONS WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS ON THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2006 AND ON COST FOR FISCAL 2007.

MULTI-EMPLOYER PLANS

THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN VARIOUS MULTI-EMPLOYER PENSION PLANS UNDER UNION AND INDUSTRY-WIDE AGREEMENTS. IN 2006, 2005, AND 2004, THE CONTRIBUTIONS TO

THESE PLANS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY EXPENSED AS INCURRED, WERE $51 MILLION, $37 MILLION, AND $38 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

-104-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS SAVINGS AND INVESTMENT PLANS THAT ALLOW ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES TO ALLOCATE UP TO 20% OF THEIR SALARY THROUGH PAYROLL DEDUCTIONS DEPENDING ON THE PLAN IN WHICH THE EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATES. THE COMPANY MATCHES

50% OF THE EMPLOYEES PRE-TAX CONTRIBUTIONS, UP TO PLAN LIMITS. IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004, THE COSTS OF THESE PLANS WERE $39 MILLION, $35 MILLION AND $33 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT

IN MAY 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION NO. 106-2,

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (FSP 106-2)

IN RESPONSE TO A NEW LAW REGARDING PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFITS UNDER MEDICARE AS WELL AS A FEDERAL

SUBSIDY TO SPONSORS OF RETIREE HEALTHCARE BENEFIT PLANS.

THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 WAS

REFLECTED IN ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 ASSUMING THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT TO RETIREES THAT IS AT LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE PART

D AND THE COMPANY WILL RECEIVE THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY.

THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004

DECREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $110 MILLION DUE TO THE EFFECT OF THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY, AND NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COST FOR 2006 AND 2005 WERE REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION AND $28 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

AS OF THE

FILING DATE OF THIS REPORT, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS HAD NOT YET DECLARED A DIVIDEND RELATED TO FISCAL 2006. THE COMPANY PAID A $519 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.27 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2006 RELATED TO FISCAL 2005; PAID A $490

MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.24 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005 RELATED TO FISCAL 2004; AND PAID A $430 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.21 PER SHARE) DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 RELATED TO FISCAL 2003.

DURING FISCAL 2006, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 243 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY $6.9 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2005, THE

COMPANY REPURCHASED 91 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 15 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY $335 MILLION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2006, THE COMPANY HAD REMAINING AUTHORIZATION IN PLACE TO REPURCHASE APPROXIMATELY 206 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE AN EXPIRATION DATE.

THE PAR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS 1.0 BILLION SHARES OF INTERNET GROUP STOCK AT $.01 PAR VALUE AUTHORIZED. NO SHARES ARE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING.

EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION

UNDER VARIOUS PLANS, THE COMPANY MAY GRANT STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY BASED AWARDS TO EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT, AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL. IN DECEMBER

2004, THE COMPANY ADOPTED A NEW APPROACH TO LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, PURSUANT TO WHICH IT INCREASED THE PROPORTION OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) AND DECREASED THE PROPORTION OF STOCK OPTIONS USED IN LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS.

STOCK OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY GRANTED AT EXERCISE PRICES EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING THE MARKET PRICE AT THE DATE OF GRANT. EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY

2003, OPTIONS BECAME EXERCISABLE RATABLY OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE GRANT DATE, WHILE OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 2003 GENERALLY VEST RATABLY OVER FIVE YEARS. EFFECTIVE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005, OPTIONS GRANTED GENERALLY EXPIRE SEVEN

YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE, WHILE OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005 GENERALLY EXPIRE TEN YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT. AT THE DISCRETION OF THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, OPTIONS CAN

OCCASIONALLY EXTEND UP TO 15 YEARS AFTER DATE OF GRANT. RESTRICTED STOCK

-105-

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNITS GENERALLY VEST 50% ON EACH OF THE SECOND AND FOURTH ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT DATE. CERTAIN RSUS AWARDED TO SENIOR EXECUTIVES VEST BASED UPON THE

ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS. STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS ARE FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES WHO TERMINATE PRIOR TO VESTING. SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE OPTION AND RSU GRANTS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 TOTALED 51 MILLION. THE COMPANY SATISFIES STOCK

OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF RSUS WITH NEWLY ISSUED SHARES.

EACH YEAR DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY AWARDS STOCK OPTIONS AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO A BROAD-BASED GROUP OF MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL (THE ANNUAL GRANT). PRIOR TO THE FISCAL 2006 ANNUAL GRANT, THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS GRANTED WAS ESTIMATED ON THE GRANT DATE USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION PRICING

MODEL. BEGINNING WITH THE FISCAL 2006 ANNUAL GRANT, THE COMPANY HAS CHANGED TO THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL CONSIDERS CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF FAIR VALUE OPTION PRICING THAT ARE NOT CONSIDERED UNDER THE BLACK-SCHOLES

MODEL. SIMILAR TO THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL, THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS VOLATILITY, DIVIDEND YIELD, AND THE RISK FREE INTEREST RATE. HOWEVER, THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED EXERCISE

MULTIPLE (THE MULTIPLE OF EXERCISE PRICE TO GRANT PRICE AT WHICH EXERCISES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON AVERAGE) AND THE TERMINATION RATE (THE PROBABILITY OF A VESTED OPTION BEING CANCELLED DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE OPTION HOLDER) IN COMPUTING THE

VALUE OF THE OPTION. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL SHOULD PRODUCE A FAIR VALUE THAT IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE VALUE OF AN EMPLOYEE OPTION.

IN FISCAL YEARS 2006, 2005, AND 2004, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE OPTION-PRICING MODELS WERE AS FOLLOWS.

COMMENCING WITH THE 2006 ANNUAL GRANT, THE COMPANY UTILIZED THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL.

(2)

THE COMPANY UTILIZED THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL DURING FISCAL 2005 AND FISCAL 2004.

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS NOT ADJUSTED AFTER THE GRANT DATE, CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE THE VALUE OF,

AND THEREFORE THE EXPENSE RELATED TO, FUTURE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE GREATEST VARIATION IN FAIR VALUE IN THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ARE THE ASSUMED VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN

EITHER THE ASSUMED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE WILL CAUSE THE BINOMIAL OPTION VALUE TO INCREASE OR DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION FOR FISCAL 2006 AND 2005 CONSIDERS BOTH HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS. VOLATILITY FOR FISCAL 2004 WAS

ESTIMATED BASED UPON HISTORICAL SHARE-PRICE VOLATILITY.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS AND STOCK OPTIONS IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE

VESTING PERIOD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS IS BASED UPON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE AWARDS ON THE GRANT DATE; HOWEVER, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS IS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITY OF

VESTING.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS BORROWING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE

IS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND ON THE MARKET VALUE OF ITS INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ITS FIXED RATE DEBT EXPRESSED AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT

BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE.

THE COMPANY TYPICALLY USES PAY-FLOATING AND PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO FACILITATE ITS

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. PAY-FLOATING SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FIXED RATE MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS TO VARIABLE RATE INSTRUMENTS INDEXED TO LIBOR. PAY-FLOATING SWAP AGREEMENTS IN PLACE AT YEAR-END EXPIRE IN 1 TO 16 YEARS.

PAY-FIXED SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS TO FIXED RATE INSTRUMENTS. THE PAY-FIXED SWAPS IN PLACE AT YEAR-END EXPIRE IN 2 TO 9 YEARS. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND OCTOBER 1, 2005 RESPECTIVELY, THE COMPANY HELD $192

MILLION AND $151 MILLION NOTIONAL VALUE OF PAY-FIXED SWAPS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES. THE CHANGES IN MARKET VALUES OF ALL SWAPS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES HAVE BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS.

THE IMPACT OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR FISCAL 2006, 2005, AND 2004. THE NET AMOUNT OF DEFERRED GAINS IN AOCI FROM INTEREST RATE RISK

MANAGEMENT TRANSACTIONS WAS $5 MILLION AND $8 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND OCTOBER 1, 2005 RESPECTIVELY.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY TRANSACTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND IS SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. THE

COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES THEREBY ENABLING MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY

ASSETS, LIABILITIES, FIRM COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY USES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY HEDGES ITS

FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS FOR PERIODS GENERALLY NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM RANGE OF ANNUAL EXPOSURE. THE COMPANY USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FIRM

COMMITMENTS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED FORECASTED TRANSACTION, ASSET, LIABILITY OR FIRM COMMITMENT. THE PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE

YEN AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLARS.

MARK TO MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON CONTRACTS HEDGING FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS ARE INITIALLY RECORDED TO AOCI AND ARE RECLASSIFIED TO CURRENT EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE REALIZED, OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE VALUE

OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND OCTOBER 1, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD PRE-TAX DEFERRED GAINS OF $106 MILLION AND $114 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND PRE-TAX DEFERRED LOSSES OF $60 MILLION AND $69 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES ON FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS.

DEFERRED AMOUNTS TO BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WILL

CHANGE WITH MARKET CONDITIONS AND WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE RELATED HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. DEFERRED LOSSES RECORDED IN AOCI FOR CONTRACTS THAT WILL MATURE IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS TOTALED $15 MILLION. THE COMPANY

RECLASSIFIED AFTER-TAX LOSSES OF $6 MILLION AND $108 MILLION FROM AOCI TO EARNINGS DURING FISCAL 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THESE LOSSES WERE OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED.

DURING FISCAL 2006 AND 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED THE CHANGE IN FAIR MARKET VALUE RELATED TO FAIR VALUE HEDGES AND THE INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO CASH

FLOW HEDGES TO EARNINGS. THE AMOUNTS OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ON CASH FLOW HEDGES WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR FISCAL 2006, FISCAL 2005, AND FISCAL 2004. THE TOTAL IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ON OPERATING INCOME IN 2006, 2005, AND

2004 WERE LOSSES OF $27 MILLION, $168 MILLION, AND $277 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE NET LOSSES FROM THESE HEDGES OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED.

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS WITH, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE COUNTERPARTIES TO ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY THE

COUNTERPARTIES.

THE COMPANY WOULD NOT REALIZE A MATERIAL LOSS AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY SINGLE

COUNTERPARTY. THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS ONLY WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF A- OR BETTER. THE COMPANYS CURRENT POLICY REGARDING AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES IS

GENERALLY TO REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A- OR IN THE EVENT AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED LIMITS AS DEFINED BY CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES AND INVESTMENTS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AT SEPTEMBER 30,

2006 DUE TO THE WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS INTO WHICH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD, THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO AMONG ISSUERS.

LEGAL MATTERS

MILNE AND DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. V. STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC.

ON NOVEMBER 5, 2002, CLARE MILNE, THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A. A. MILNE, AUTHOR OF THE WINNIE THE POOH BOOKS, AND THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC.

(DEI) FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. (SSI) IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2002, MS. MILNE SERVED NOTICES TO SSI AND DEI TERMINATING A. A. MILNES

PRIOR GRANT OF RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH, EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004, AND GRANTED ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS TO DEI. IN THEIR LAWSUIT, MS. MILNE AND DEI SOUGHT A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT, UNDER UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT LAW, THAT MS. MILNES

TERMINATION NOTICES WERE VALID; THAT SSIS RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH IN THE UNITED STATES TERMINATED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004; THAT UPON TERMINATION OF SSIS RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT THAT IS THE

SUBJECT OF THE STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY LAWSUIT TERMINATED BY OPERATION OF LAW; AND THAT, AS OF NOVEMBER 5, 2004, SSI WAS ENTITLED TO NO FURTHER ROYALTIES FOR USES OF WINNIE THE POOH. SSI FILED (A) AN ANSWER

DENYING THE MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT AND (B) COUNTERCLAIMS SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT (I) MS. MILNES GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI IS VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE AND (II) DEI REMAINS OBLIGATED TO PAY SSI ROYALTIES UNDER

THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT. THE DISTRICT COURT RULED THAT MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE INVALID. THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT AFFIRMED, AND ON JUNE 26, 2006, THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DENIED MILNES PETITION

FOR A WRIT OF CERTIORARI. ON JUNE 23, 2003, SSI FILED AN AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS AND A THIRD-PARTY COMPLAINT AGAINST HARRIET HUNT (HEIR TO E. H. SHEPARD, ILLUSTRATOR OF THE ORIGINAL WINNIE THE POOH STORIES), WHO HAD SERVED A NOTICE OF

TERMINATION AND A GRANT OF RIGHTS SIMILAR TO MS. MILNES, AND ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE MILNE AND HUNT TERMINATIONS AND THE GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI FOR (A) UNLAWFUL AND UNFAIR BUSINESS

PRACTICES; AND (B) BREACH OF THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT.

ON OCTOBER 19, 2006, THE PARTIES STIPULATED TO SSIS FILING ITS

FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS (FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER) SEEKING (A) TO INVALIDATE THE HUNT TERMINATION NOTICE, (B) TO TERMINATE THE COMPANYS RIGHTS VIS-À-VIS SSI, AND (C) DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF TWO BILLION DOLLARS,

AMONG OTHER RELIEF. THAT STIPULATION ALSO PROVIDED THAT HUNT AND THE COMPANY NEED NOT RESPOND TO THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER UNTIL THE CONCLUSION OF TWO EVENTS: THE STATE COURT APPEAL IN

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY,

AND

THE TRIAL IN THE DISTRICT COURT ON THE VALIDITY OF THE HUNT TERMINATION NOTICE. SSI THEN SOUGHT TO WITHDRAW BOTH THE FOURTH AMENDED ANSWER AND ITS STIPULATION, BUT ON NOVEMBER 3, 2006, THE COURT DENIED THAT REQUEST AND ORDERED THAT THE HUNT

TERMINATION TRIAL COMMENCE ON MARCH 20, 2007.

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

. IN THIS LAWSUIT, FILED ON

FEBRUARY 27, 1991 IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT, THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT A COMPANY SUBSIDIARY DEFRAUDED IT AND BREACHED A 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH PROPERTIES, BY FAILING TO ACCOUNT FOR AND

PAY ROYALTIES ON REVENUES EARNED FROM THE SALE OF WINNIE THE POOH MOVIES ON VIDEOCASSETTE AND FROM THE EXPLOITATION OF WINNIE THE POOH MERCHANDISING RIGHTS. THE PLAINTIFF SEEKS DAMAGES FOR THE LICENSEES ALLEGED BREACHES AS WELL AS CONFIRMATION

OF THE PLAINTIFFS INTERPRETATION OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE ACTIVITIES. THE PLAINTIFF ALSO SEEKS THE RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT ON THE BASIS OF THE ALLEGED BREACHES. IF EACH OF THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS WERE TO

BE CONFIRMED IN A FINAL JUDGMENT, DAMAGES AS ARGUED BY THE PLAINTIFF COULD TOTAL AS MUCH AS SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE TO THE COMPANY OF ANY FUTURE EXPLOITATION OF THE LICENSED RIGHTS. ON MARCH 29, 2004, THE

COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION FOR TERMINATING SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF FOR A HOST OF DISCOVERY ABUSES, INCLUDING THE WITHHOLDING, ALTERATION, AND THEFT OF DOCUMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION, AND, ON APRIL 5, 2004, DISMISSED

PLAINTIFFS CASE WITH PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS TO DISQUALIFY THE JUDGE WHO GRANTED THE TERMINATING SANCTIONS WERE DENIED IN 2004, AND ITS MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL WAS DENIED ON JANUARY 26, 2005, ALLOWING

PLAINTIFF TO PROCEED WITH ITS NOTICED APPEAL FROM THE APRIL 5, 2004, ORDER OF DISMISSAL. ARGUMENT OF THE APPEAL HAS NOT BEEN SCHEDULED.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT CURRENTLY POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES, CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR CO-DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS

INVOLVING COPYRIGHT, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE COMPANY TO SUFFER ANY MATERIAL LIABILITY BY REASON OF SUCH ACTIONS.
