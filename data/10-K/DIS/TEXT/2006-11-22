based on nielsen media research, u.s. television household estimates, january1, 2006  cable/satellite networks and international broadcast operations  our cable/satellite networks and international broadcast operations are principally involved inthe distribution of television programming, the licensing of programming to domestic and international markets, and
investing in foreign television broadcasting, production, and distribution entities. the cable networks produce their own programs or acquire programming rights from other producers and rights holders for network programming.  cable network operations derive substantially all of their revenues from affiliate fees charged tocable service providers and/or the sale to
advertisers of time in network programs for commercial announcements. generally, the companys cable networks operate under multi-year carriage agreements with cable/satellite service providers that include contractually determined affiliate
fees. the amounts that we can charge to cable/satellite service providers for our cable network services are largely dependent on competition and the quality and quantity of programming that we can provide. the ability to sell time for commercial
announcements and the rates received are primarily dependent on the size and nature of the audience that the network can deliver to the advertiser as well as overall advertiser demand.

stations subject to transfer to citadel pursuant to the announced agreement to merge
internet and mobile operations  the internet and mobile operations of the media networks segment develop, publish, and distribute content for online and wireless services intended to appeal to broad consumer interest in sports, news, family, and entertainment. internet
web sites and products include abc.com, abcnews.com, disney.com, and espn.com. the companys internet operations derive revenue from a combination of advertising and sponsorships, subscription services, and e-commerce activities.  abc.com is the official web site of the abc television network, while abcnews.com draws on the knowledge and expertise of abc news correspondents
throughout the world to provide in-depth news coverage online. abcnews.com also offers broadband subscriptions to the 24-hour live internet news channel, abc news now, and to video-on-demand news reports from all abc news broadcasts. content
from abc and abc news is also available on select domestic cellular carrier networks.  disney.com is a centralized disney web site that
integrates many of the companys disney-branded internet sites including sites for the disney channel, parks and resorts, and walt disney pictures. disney online offers a number of premium broadband services, including disney connection and
disneys toontown online, and disney mobile studios produces and publishes mobile content that is distributed through mobile carriers and content distributors worldwide. in june 2006, the company launched disney mobile, a mobile phone service
specifically developed to meet the needs of parents and kids.  espn.com delivers comprehensive sports news, information, and video to
millions of fans each month. espn360 is a broadband service that delivers live games, highlights, inside analysis, among other content features. espn.com averages 17.5million users per month.  in february 2006, espn introduced mobile espn, the first national u.s. wireless phone service specifically targeted to sports fans. in september 2006,
the company announced mobile espn would be transitioned into its existing wireless business, which distributes mobile content to various wireless devices.  competition and seasonality  the abc television network, disney channel, espn, abc family channel, and our other broadcast
and cable and satellite services compete for viewers primarily with other television networks, independent television stations, and other video media, such as cable and satellite television programming services, dvds, video games, and the internet.
in the sale of advertising time, the broadcasting operations compete with other television networks, independent television stations, suppliers of cable and satellite services, and other advertising media such as newspapers, magazines, billboards,
and the internet. the radio networks likewise compete with other radio networks and radio programming services, independent radio stations, and other advertising media.  the companys television and radio stations compete with other television and radio stations, cable and satellite programming services, dvds and other advertising media such as newspapers, magazines, billboards,
and the internet. competition occurs primarily in individual market areas. a television or radio station in one market generally does not compete directly with stations in other markets.  the growth in the cable and satellite industrys share of viewers has resulted in increased competitive pressures for advertising revenues. the
companys cable and satellite networks also face competition for carriage by cable and satellite service operators and distributors. the companys contractual agreements with cable and satellite operators are renewed or renegotiated from
time to time in the ordinary course of business. consolidation and other market conditions in the cable and satellite distribution industry and other factors may adversely affect the companys ability to obtain and maintain contractual terms
for the distribution of its various cable and satellite programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place.

the companys media networks segment also competes for the acquisition of sports and other
programming. the market for programming is very competitive, particularly for sports programming. the company currently has sports rights agreements with the national football league (nfl), national basketball association (nba), nascar, (beginning
in 2007) and major league baseball (mlb), as well as for other sporting events, including various college football and basketball conferences, world cup, pga tour, and indy racing league, including the indianapolis 500.  the companys internet web sites and products compete with other web sites and products in their respective categories, which include kids, family,
entertainment, sports, and news, among others.  advertising revenues at the media networks are subject to seasonal advertising patterns.
revenues are typically somewhat higher during the fall and somewhat lower during the summer months. affiliate revenues are typically collected ratably throughout the year. certain affiliate revenues at espn are deferred until annual programming
commitments are met, and these commitments are typically satisfied during the second half of the companys fiscal year, which generally results in higher revenue recognition during this period.  federal regulation  television and radio
broadcasting are subject to extensive regulation by the federal communications commission (fcc) under federal laws and regulations, including the communications act of 1934, as amended. violation of fcc regulations can result in substantial monetary
forfeitures, limited renewals of licenses and, in egregious cases, denial of license renewal or revocation of a license. fcc regulations that affect our media networks segment include the following:
licensing of television and radio stations. each of the television and radio stations we own must be licensed by the fcc. these licenses are granted for periods of up to
eight years, and we must obtain renewal of licenses as they expire in order to continue operating the stations. we (or the acquiring entity in the case of a divestiture) must also obtain fcc approval whenever we seek to have a license transferred in
connection with the acquisition or divestiture of a station. the fcc may decline to renew or approve the transfer of a license in certain circumstances. although we have generally received such renewals and approvals in the past, there can be no
assurance that we will always obtain necessary renewals and approvals in the future.
television and radio station ownership limits. the fcc imposes limitations on the number of television stations and radio stations we can own in a specific market, on the
combined number of television and radio stations we can own in a single market and on the aggregate percentage of the national audience that can be reached by television stations we own. currently:
fcc regulations may restrict our ability to own more than one television station in a market, depending on the size and nature of the market. we do not own more than one television
station in any of the ten markets in which we own a television station.
federal statutes permit our television stations in the aggregate to reach a maximum of 39% of the national audience (for this purpose, fcc regulations attribute to uhf television
stations only 50% of the television households in their market). our stations reach approximately 24% of the national audience (approximately 23% when calculated using the fccs attribution rules).
fcc regulations in some cases impose restrictions on our ability to acquire additional radio or television stations in the markets in which we own radio stations, but we do not
believe any such limitations are material to our current operating plans.  in july 2003, the fcc adopted revised limits on
television and radio station ownership. the rules adopted generally would have relaxed existing ownership restrictions and permitted entities to own more television and radio stations in some markets. they also would have eliminated the 50% discount
for calculating households reached by uhf television stations operated by the top four broadcast television networks (including abc). the new rules, however, were challenged in federal court and were remanded by the court to the fcc to review the
rules. as a

result, most of the revised rules adopted by the fcc in july 2003 are not in effect. this year, the fcc initiated a rulemaking in response to the court
remand to re-evaluate these rules in light of the court decision. although it is possible that the fcc may implement more liberal media ownership rules than those currently in effect (other than those governed by statute), we cannot predict whether
the revised rules will be implemented and if so, when such rules will become effective.
dual networks. fcc rules currently prohibit any of the four major television networks  abc, cbs, fox and nbc  from being under common ownership or control.
regulation of programming. the fcc regulates programming by, among other things, banning indecent programming, regulating political advertising, and imposing
commercial time limits during childrens programming. broadcasters face a heightened risk of being found in violation of the indecency prohibition by the fcc because of recent fcc decisions, coupled with the spontaneity of live programming.
recently, the fcc has indicated that it is stepping up enforcement activities as they apply to indecency, and has indicated it would consider license revocation for serious violations. moreover, legislation has been introduced in congress that would
increase penalties for broadcasting indecent programming.
federal legislation and fcc rules also limit the amount of commercial matter that may be shown on broadcast or cable channels during programming designed for children 12 years of
age and younger. in addition, broadcast channels are generally required to provide a minimum of three hours per week of programming that has as a significant purpose meeting the educational and informational needs of children 16 years of
age and younger. fccrules also give television station owners the right to reject or refuse network programming in certain circumstances or to substitute programming that the licensee reasonably believes to be of greater local or national
importance.
cable and satellite carriage of broadcast television stations. with respect to cable systems operating within a television stations designated market area, fcc rules
require that every three years each television station elect either must carry status, pursuant to which cable operators generally must carry a local television station in the stations market, or retransmission consent
status, pursuant to which the cable operator must negotiate with the television station to obtain the consent of the television station prior to carrying its signal. under the satellite home viewer improvement act and its successor, the satellite
home viewer extension and reauthorization act, satellite carriers are permitted to retransmit a local television stations signal into its local market with the consent of the local television station. if a satellite carrier elects to carry one
local station in a market, the satellite carrier must carry the signals of all local television stations that also request carriage. certain of the satellite carriage provisions are set to expire on december31, 2009.
digital television. fcc rules currently require full-power analog television stations, such as ours, to provide digital service on a second broadcast channel granted
specifically for the phase-in of digital broadcasting. fcc rules also regulate digital broadcasting to ensure continued quality carriage of mandated free over-the-air program service. all of the companys stations have launched digital
facilities, and we are evaluating various options with respect to use of digital channels. under a recently-enacted statute, all broadcasters are required to operate exclusively in digital mode and permanently surrender one of their two channels by
february17, 2009.  the foregoing is a brief summary of certain provisions of the communications act and other
legislation and of specific fcc rules and policies. this summary focuses on provisions material to our business. reference should be made to the communications act, other legislation, fcc rules and public notices and rulings of the fcc for further
information concerning the nature and extent of the fccs regulatory authority.  fcc laws and regulations are subject to change, and
the company generally cannot predict whether new legislation, court action or regulations, or a change in the extent of application or enforcement of current laws and regulations, would have an adverse impact on our operations.

competition and seasonality  the companys theme parks and resorts compete with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism, and recreational activities. the profitability of the leisure-time industry may be influenced by various
factors that are not directly controllable, such as economic conditions including business cycle and exchange rate fluctuations, travel industry trends, amount of available leisure time, oil and transportation prices, and weather patterns.
all of the theme parks and the associated resort facilities are operated on a year-round basis. historically, the theme parks and resort
business experiences fluctuations in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel and local entertainment excursions. peak attendance and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months
when school vacations occur and during early-winter and spring-holiday periods.  studio entertainment  the studio entertainment segment produces and acquires live-action and animated motion pictures, direct-to-video programming, musical recordings, and
live-stage plays.  the company distributes produced and acquired films (including its film and television library) to the theatrical, home
entertainment, pay-per-view, video-on-demand, pay television, and free-to-air television markets. each of these market windows is discussed in more detail below.  theatrical distribution  walt disney pictures and television, a subsidiary of the company, produces and acquires
live-action motion pictures that are distributed primarily under the walt disney pictures and touchstone pictures banners. as part of a recently-announced shift in strategy, the company expects to weight distribution of films more toward
disney-branded films and away from touchstone films. another subsidiary, miramax film corp., acquires and produces motion pictures that are distributed under the miramax banner. the company distributed motion pictures under the dimension banner
through september30, 2005. all releases under the dimension banner after september30, 2005 are owned and distributed by the weinstein company, a third-party company operated by the former co-chairmen of miramax. the company retains a
license to continue to use the dimension banner on titles that were released prior to september30, 2005. the company also produces and distributes animated motion pictures under the banner walt disney pictures, including the films produced by
pixar. refer to relationship with pixar section below for further information.  during fiscal 2007, we expect to distribute in
domestic markets approximately 14 feature films under the walt disney pictures and touchstone pictures banners and approximately nine films under the miramax banner. these expected releases include several live-action family films and full-length
animated films, with the remainder targeted to teenagers and/or adults. as of september30, 2006, the company had released domestically 894 full-length live-action features, 77 full-length animated features, approximately 542 cartoon shorts and
53 live action shorts under the walt disney pictures, touchstone pictures, hollywood pictures, miramax, and dimension banners.  we
distribute and market our filmed products principally through our own distribution and marketing companies in the u.s. in the international market, we distribute our filmed products both directly and through independent foreign distribution
companies. films released theatrically in the u.s. can be released simultaneously theatrically in international territories or generally up to six months later. the company recently reorganized its theatrical distribution operations into one
worldwide theatrical distribution unit.  the company incurs significant marketing and advertising costs before and throughout the
theatrical release of a film in an effort to generate public awareness of the film, to increase the publics intent to view the film, and to help generate significant consumer interest in the subsequent home entertainment and other ancillary
markets. these costs are expensed as incurred, therefore, we typically incur losses in the theatrical markets on a film, including the quarters before the theatrical release of the film.

home entertainment  in the domestic market, we distribute home-entertainment releases under each of our motion picture banners. in the international market, we distribute home-entertainment releases under each of our motion picture
banners both directly and through independent foreign distribution companies. inaddition, we develop, acquire, and produce original programming for direct-to-video release. thecompany recently reorganized its home-entertainment
operations into one worldwide home-entertainment unit.  the domestic and international home-entertainment window typically starts four to
six months after each theatrical release with the issuance of a variety of physical and electronic versions of each title (including, but not limited to dvd, bluray and electronic formats). we have recently begun to distribute our films in the
home-entertainment market electronically, including via itunes and other distribution services.  domestically, most titles are sold
simultaneously to both rentailers, such as blockbuster inc., and retailers, such as wal-mart stores, inc. and best buy co., inc. in the international home-entertainment market, titles are either released simultaneously in the rental and
retail channels or with a rental window before the retail window, depending on local market regulations, dvd hardware penetration, and demand for dvds. the international market has experienced a trend in the compression of, or in some cases the
disappearance of, the rental window.  as of september30, 2006, under the banners walt disney pictures, touchstone pictures, hollywood
pictures, miramax, and dimension, 1,362 produced and acquired titles, including 1,129 liveaction titles and 233 cartoon shorts and animated features, were available to the domestic home-entertainment marketplace and 2,912 produced and acquired
titles, including 2,227 live action titles and 685 cartoon shorts and animated features, were available to the international home-entertainment market.  television distribution  pay-per-view (ppv): generally about one to two months after the home entertainment window
begins, the studios television distributor, buena vista television, licenses titles to cable, satellite, and internet platforms for showing on a pay-per-view basis. ppv services, such as in demand and directv, deliver one-time rentals
electronically to consumers televisions at a price comparable to that of physical media rentals. video-on-demand (vod) is an extension of ppv and currently shares the ppv window. the ppv/vod window generally lasts about three months.
pay television (pay 1): there are generally two pay television windows. the first window is generally fifteen months in duration
and follows the ppv/vod window. the company has licensed exclusive domestic pay television rights to certain films released under the walt disney pictures, touchstone pictures, hollywood pictures, miramax, and dimension banners to the encore pay
television services over a multi-year period.  free television (free 1): the pay 1 window is followed by a free television window
wherein telecasts are accessible to consumers without charge. this free window may last up to 84 months. motion pictures are usually sold in the free 1 window on an ad-hoc basis to major networks and basic cable services. for films released
theatrically prior to october1, 2004, the studio maintained only one output arrangement with the abc television network. films released after that date can be sold on an ad-hoc basis to all networks, including the abc television network.
pay television 2 (pay 2) and free television 2 (free 2): in the u.s., free 1 is generally followed by a twelve month pay 2 window,
included under our license arrangement with encore, and finally by a free 2 window. the free 2 window is a syndication window where films are licensed both to basic cable networks and to station groups, such as tribune co. major packages of the
companys feature films and animated television programming have been licensed for broadcast under multi-year agreements.  international television: the company also licenses its theatrical and television properties outside of the u.s. the typical windowing sequence is broadly consistent with the domestic cycle such that titles premiere on television in
ppv/vod then air in pay tv before airing in free tv. windowing strategies are developed in response to local market practices and conditions, and the exact sequence and length of each window can vary country by country.  certain properties may be re-licensed in one or more of the above television windows.

competition and seasonality  the success of studio entertainment operations is heavily dependent upon public taste and preferences. in addition, studio entertainment operating results fluctuate due to the timing and performance of releases in the
theatrical, home entertainment, and television markets. release dates are determined by several factors, including competition and the timing of vacation and holiday periods.  the studio entertainment businesses compete with all forms of entertainment. a significant number of companies produce and/or distribute theatrical and
television films, exploit products in the home entertainment market, provide pay television programming services, and sponsor live theater. we also compete to obtain creative and performing talents, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast
rights, and market share, that are essential to the success of our studio entertainment businesses.  consumer products  the consumer products segment partners with licensees, manufacturers, publishers, and retailers throughout the world to design, promote, and sell a wide

investment in internally developed and published games through the acquisition of studios and increased product development spending. bvg also licenses
properties such as kingdom hearts 2 and cars to third-party developers.  disneyshopping.com  disneyshopping.com offers disney-themed merchandise through an internet site, which includes internally developed disney merchandise as well as exclusive
merchandise from other disney units and disney licensees.  the disney store  the company markets disney-themed products directly through retail stores operated under the disney store name. these facilities are generally located in
leading shopping malls and other retail complexes. the stores carry a wide variety of disney merchandise and promote other businesses of thecompany. the company owns and operates 103 stores, primarily in europe. in japan, the stores
areoperated under a licensing arrangement. in fiscal 2005, 315 stores in north america were sold to awholly-owned subsidiary of the childrens place, which operates them under a franchising arrangement. at september30, 2006,
the childrens place operated 325 stores under this arrangement. see note 3 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion on the sale of the disney store chain in north america.  competition and seasonality  the company competes in
its character merchandising and other licensing, publishing, interactive, and retail activities with other licensors, publishers, and retailers of character, brand, and celebrity names. based on independent surveys, we believe the company is the
largest worldwide licensor of character-based merchandise and producer/distributor of childrens film-related products based on retail sales. operating results for the licensing and retail distribution business are influenced by seasonal
consumer purchasing behavior and by the timing and performance of animated theatrical releases.  intellectual property protection  the companys businesses are affected by its ability throughout the world to exploit and protect against infringement of its intellectual property,
including trademarks, trade names, copyrights, patents, and trade secrets. important intellectual property includes rights in the content of motion pictures, television programs, electronic games, sound recordings, character likenesses, theme park
attractions, books, and magazines.  the companys ability to exploit and protect intellectual property rights is affected by the
strength and effectiveness of intellectual property laws in the united states and abroad. inadequate laws or enforcement mechanisms to protect intellectual property in a country can adversely affect the results of the companys operations,
despite the companys strong efforts to protect its intellectual property rights. in addition, a variety of factors, including technological advances, such as peer-to-peer technology and some features of digital video recorders have made
infringement easier and faster and enforcement more challenging. therefore, the company devotes significant resources to protecting its intellectual property against unauthorized use in the united states and foreign markets.  the company is also subject to the risk of challenges by third parties claiming infringement of their proprietary rights. regardless of their validity,
such claims may result in substantial costs and diversion of resources which could have an adverse effect on the companys operations.  available

item1a. risk factors  for an enterprise as large and complex as the company, a wide range of factors
could materially affect future developments and performance. in addition to the factors affecting specific business operations identified in connection with the description of these operations and the financial results of these operations elsewhere
in this report, the most significant factors affecting our operations include the following:  changes in u.s., global, or regional economic conditions
could adversely affect the profitability of any of our businesses.  a decrease in economic activity in the united states or in other
regions of the world in which we do business could adversely affect demand for any of our businesses, thus reducing our revenue and earnings. a decline in economic conditions could reduce attendance and spending at one or more of our parks and
resorts, purchase of or prices for advertising on our broadcast or cable networks or owned stations, prices that cable operators will pay for our cable programming, performance of our theatrical and home entertainment releases, and purchases of
company-licensed consumer products. in addition, an increase in price levels generally, or in price levels in a particular sector such as the energy sector, could result in a shift in consumer demand away from the entertainment and consumer products
we offer, which could also adversely affect our revenues and, at the same time, increase our costs. changes in exchange rates for foreign currencies may reduce international demand for our products, increase our labor or supply costs in non-united
states markets, or reduce the united states dollar value of revenue we receive from other markets.  changes in public and consumer tastes and
preferences for entertainment and consumer products could reduce demand for our entertainment offerings and products and reduce profitability.  each of our businesses creates entertainment or consumer products whose success depends substantially on consumer tastes and preferences that change in often unpredictable ways. the success of our businesses depends on our ability to
consistently create and distribute filmed entertainment, broadcast and cable programming, theme park attractions, resort facilities, and consumer products that meet the changing preferences of the broad consumer market. many of our businesses
increasingly depend on worldwide acceptance of our offerings and products, and their success therefore depends on our ability to successfully predict and adapt to changing consumer tastes and preferences outside as well as inside the united states.
moreover, we must often invest substantial amounts in film production, broadcast and cable programming, theme park attractions, or resort facilities before we learn the extent to which products will earn consumer acceptance. if our entertainment
offerings and products do not achieve sufficient consumer acceptance, our revenue from advertising sales (which are based in part on ratings for the programs in which advertisements air) or subscription fees for broadcast and cable programming, from
theatrical film receipts or home video sales, from theme park admissions and resort room, food, and beverage charges, from sales of licensed consumer products or from sales of our other consumer products, and services may decline and adversely
affect the profitability of one or more of our businesses.  changes in technology and in consumer consumption patterns may affect demand for our
entertainment products or the cost of producing or distributing products.  the media and entertainment businesses in which we
participate depend significantly on our ability to acquire, develop, adopt and exploit new technologies to distinguish our products and services from those of our competitors. in addition, new technologies affect the demand for our products, the
time and manner in which consumers acquire and view some of our entertainment products and the options available to advertisers for reaching their desired markets. for example:
the success of our offerings in the home entertainment market depends in part on consumer preferences with respect to home entertainment formats, including dvd players and personal
video recorders, as well as the availability of alternative home entertainment offerings and technologies, including web-based delivery of entertainment offerings;
-20-
table of contents
technological developments offer consumers an expanding array of entertainment options and if consumers favor options we have not yet fully developed rather than the entertainment
products we offer, our sales may be adversely affected.  the unauthorized use of our intellectual property rights may increase the cost of
protecting these rights or reduce our revenues.  the success of our businesses is highly dependent on maintenance of intellectual
property rights in the entertainment products and services we create. new technologies such as peer-to-peer technology, high speed digital transmission (including digital distribution of theatrical films) and some features of digital video recorders
have made infringement of our intellectual property in films and television programming easier and faster and enforcement of intellectual property rights more challenging. there is evidence that unauthorized use of intellectual property rights in
the entertainment industry generally is a significant and rapidly growing phenomenon. these developments require us to devote substantial resources to protecting our intellectual property against unauthorized use and present the risk of increased
losses of revenue as a result of sales of unauthorized products.  a variety of uncontrollable events may reduce demand for our products and services or
impair our ability to provide or increase the cost of providing products and services.  demand for our products and services,
particularly our theme parks and resorts, is highly dependent on the general environment for travel and tourism. the environment for travel and tourism, as well as demand for other entertainment products, can be significantly adversely affected in
the united states, globally or in specific regions as a result of a variety of factors beyond our control, including: adverse weather conditions or natural disasters (such as excessive heat or rain, hurricanes and earthquakes); health concerns;
international, political or military developments; and terrorist attacks. these events, and others such as fluctuations in travel and energy costs and computer virus attacks or other widespread computing or telecommunications failures, may also
damage our ability to provide our products and services or to obtain insurance coverage with respect to these events. due to recent weather events, we are currently limited in the extent of insurance we can obtain for wind damage and are carrying
more self-insurance with respect to this risk than we have in the past.  sustained increases in costs of pension and post-retirement medical and other
employee health and welfare benefits may reduce our profitability.  with more than 133,000 employees, our profitability is
substantially affected by costs of pension benefits and current and post-retirement medical benefits. in recent years, we have experienced significant increases in these costs as a result of macro-economic factors beyond our control, including
increases in health care costs. in addition, changes in investment returns and discount rates used to calculate pension and related liabilities may affect our costs in some years. at least some of these macro-economic factors may continue to put
upward pressure on the cost of providing pension and medical benefits. although we have actively sought to control increases in these costs, there can be no assurance that we will succeed in limiting cost increases, and continued upward pressure
could reduce the profitability of our businesses.  changes in our business strategy or restructuring of our businesses may increase our costs or
otherwise affect the profitability of our businesses.  as changes in our business environment occur we may need to adjust our business
strategies to meet these changes or we may otherwise find it necessary to restructure our operations or particular businesses or assets. in addition, external events including acceptance of our theatrical offerings and changes in macro-economic
conditions may impair the value of our assets. when these changes or events occur, we may incur costs to change our business strategy and may need to write down the value of assets. we may also need to invest in new businesses that have short-term
returns that are negative or low and whose ultimate business prospects are uncertain. in any of these events, our costs may increase, we may have significant charges associated with the write-down of assets or returns on new investments may be lower
than prior to the change in strategy or restructuring.

the companys acquisition of pixar will cause short term dilution in earnings per share and there can be no
assurance that anticipated improvements in earnings per share will be realized.  on may5, 2006 (the closing date), the company
completed its all stock acquisition of pixar. topurchase pixar, disney exchanged 2.3 shares of its common stock for each share of pixar common stock resulting in the issuance of 279million shares of disney common stock and converted
previously issued vested and unvested pixar equity-based awards into approximately 45million disney equity-based awards.  the
transaction resulted in lower earnings per share in fiscal 2006 than would have been earned by the company in the absence of the transaction and this dilution is expected to continue in fiscal 2007 and possibly in future years. in addition, the
issuance of shares in connection with the transaction has decreased the aggregate voting power of the companys pre-transaction shareholders. the company expects that over time the transaction will yield benefits to the company such that the
transaction will ultimately be accretive to earnings per share. however, there can be no assurance that the increase in earnings per share expected in the longer term will be achieved. in order to achieve increases in earnings per share as a result
of the acquisition, the company will, among other things, need to effectively continue the successful operations of pixar after the acquisition, develop successful sequels to prior pixar productions, and improve the overall performance of the disney
feature animation business.  macro-economic factors may impede access to or increase the cost of financing our operations and investments.
changes in u.s. and global financial and equity markets, including market disruptions and significant interest rate fluctuations, may
make it more difficult for us to obtain financing for our operations or investments or increase the cost of obtaining financing. in addition, our borrowing costs can be affected by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating
agencies which are based, in significant part, on the companys performance as measured by credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. a decrease in these ratings could increase our cost of borrowing or make it more difficult
for us to obtain financing.  increased competitive pressures may reduce our revenues or increase our costs.  we face substantial competition in each of our businesses from alternative providers of the products and services we offer and from other forms of
entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreational activities. we also must compete to obtain human resources, programming and other resources we require in operating our business. for example:
our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for viewers with other broadcast, cable and satellite services as well as with home video products and internet usage.
our broadcast and cable networks and stations compete for the sale of advertising time with other broadcast, cable and satellite services, as well as newspaper, magazines,
billboards and the internet.
our cable networks compete for carriage of their programming with other programming providers.
our broadcast and cable networks compete for the acquisition of creative talent and sports and other programming with other broadcast and cable networks.
our theme parks and resorts compete for guests with all other forms of entertainment, lodging, tourism and recreation activities.
our studio operations compete for customers with all other forms of entertainment.
our studio operations, broadcast and cable networks and publishing businesses compete to obtain creative and performing talent, story properties, advertiser support, broadcast
rights and market share.
our consumer products segment competes in the character merchandising and other licensing, publishing, interactive and retail activities with other licensors, publishers and
retailers of character, brand and celebrity names.
-22-
table of contents
competition in each of these areas may divert consumers from our creative or other products, or to other
products or other forms of entertainment, which could reduce our revenue or increase our marketing costs. competition for the acquisition of resources can increase the cost of producing our products and services.  our results may be adversely affected if long-term programming or carriage contracts are not renewed on sufficiently favorable terms.  we enter into long-term contracts for both the acquisition and the distribution of media programming and products, including contracts for the
acquisition of programming rights for sporting events and other programs, and contracts for the distribution of our programming to cable and satellite operators. as these contracts expire, we must renew or renegotiate the contracts, and if we are
unable to renew them on acceptable terms, we may lose programming rights or distribution rights. even if these contracts are renewed, the cost of obtaining programming rights may increase (or increase at faster rates than our historical experience)
or the revenue from distribution of programs may be reduced (or increase at slower rates than our historical experience). with respect to the acquisition of programming rights, particularly sports programming rights, the impact of these long-term
contracts on our results over the term of the contracts depends on a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts and the size of viewer audiences. there can be no assurance that revenues from
programming based on these rights will exceed the cost of the rights plus the other costs of producing and distributing the programming.  changes in
regulations applicable to our businesses may impair the profitability of our businesses.  our broadcast networks and television
stations are highly regulated, and each of our other businesses is subject to a variety of united states and overseas regulations. these regulations include:
united states fcc regulation of our television and radio networks and owned stations, including licensing of stations, ownership limits, prohibitions on indecent
programming and restrictions on commercial time in childrens programming and regulation of our broadcasting businesses in non-united states markets. additional information regarding fcc regulation is provided in item 1  business
media networks, federal regulation.
environmental protection regulations.
federal, state and foreign privacy and data protection laws and regulations.
regulation of the safety of consumer products and theme park operations.
imposition by foreign countries of trade restrictions or motion picture or television content requirements or quotas.
domestic and international tax laws or currency controls.  changes in any of these regulatory areas may require us to spend additional amounts to comply with the regulations, or may restrict our ability to offer products and services that are profitable.  labor disputes may disrupt our operations and impair our profitability.  a significant number of employees in various of our businesses are covered by collective bargaining agreements, including employees of our theme parks and resorts as well as writers, directors, actors, production
personnel and others employed in our media networks and studio operations. in addition, the employees of licensees who manufacture and retailers who sell our consumer products may be covered by collective labor agreements with their employers. a
labor dispute involving our employees or the employees of our licensees or retailers who sell our consumer products may disrupt our operations and reduce our revenues, and resolution of disputes with our employees may increase our costs.

provisions in our corporate documents and delaware state law could delay or prevent a change of control, even if that
change would be beneficial to shareholders.  our restated certificate of incorporation contains a provision regulating the ability of
shareholders to bring matters for action before annual and special meetings and authorizes our board of directors to issue and set the terms of preferred stock. the regulations on shareholder action could make it more difficult for any person
seeking to acquire control of the company to obtain shareholder approval of actions that would support this effort. the issuance of preferred stock could effectively dilute the interests of any person seeking control or otherwise make it more
difficult to obtain control. in addition, we are subject to the anti-takeover provisions of the delaware general corporation law, which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change of control in some circumstances.  the seasonality of certain of our businesses could exacerbate negative impacts on our operations.  each of our businesses is normally subject to seasonal variations, as follows:
revenues in our media networks segment are influenced by advertiser demand and the seasonal nature of programming, and audience viewership generally peaks in the winter months.
revenues in our parks and resorts segment fluctuate with changes in theme park attendance and resort occupancy resulting from the seasonal nature of vacation travel. peak attendance
and resort occupancy generally occur during the summer months, when school vacations occur, and during early-winter and spring holiday periods.
revenues in our studio entertainment segment fluctuate based on the timing of theatrical motion picture, home entertainment, and television releases. release dates for theatrical,
home entertainment, and television products are determined by several factors, including timing of vacation and holiday periods and competition in the market.
revenues in our consumer products segment are influenced by seasonal consumer purchasing behavior and the timing of animated theatrical releases and generally peak in our first
fiscal quarter due to the holiday season.  accordingly, if a short term negative impact on our business occurs during a time
of high seasonal demand (such as hurricane damage to our parks during the summer travel season), the effect could have a disproportionate effect on the results of that business for the year.
item1b. unresolved staff comments  the company has received no written comments regarding its periodic
or current reports from the staff of the securities and exchange commission that were issued 180 days or more preceding the end of its 2006 fiscal year and that remain unresolved.

item3. legal proceedings  milne and disney enterprises, inc. v. stephen slesinger, inc. on
november5, 2002, clare milne, the granddaughter of a. a. milne, author of the winnie the pooh books, and the companys subsidiary disney enterprises, inc. (dei) filed a complaint against stephen slesinger, inc. (ssi) in the united states
district court for the central district of california. on november4, 2002, ms.milne served notices to ssi and dei terminating a.a. milnes prior grant of rights to winnie the pooh, effective november5, 2004, and granted
all of those rights to dei. in their lawsuit, ms.milne and dei sought a declaratory judgment, under united states copyright law, that ms.milnes termination notices were valid; that ssis rights to winnie the pooh in the united
states terminated effective november5, 2004; that upon termination of ssis rights in the united states, the 1983 licensing agreement that is the subject of the stephen slesinger, inc. v. the walt disney company lawsuit terminated by
operation of law; and that, as of november5, 2004, ssi was entitled to no further royalties for uses of winnie the pooh. ssi filed (a)an answer denying the material allegations of the complaint and (b)counterclaims seeking a
declaration that (i)ms.milnes grant of rights to dei is void and unenforceable and (ii)dei remains obligated to pay ssi royalties under the 1983 licensing agreement. the district court ruled that milnes termination
notices were invalid. the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed, and on june26, 2006, the united states supreme court denied milnes petition for a writ of certiorari. on june23, 2003, ssi filed an amended answer and
counterclaims and a third-party complaint against harriet hunt (heir to e. h. shepard, illustrator of the original winnie the pooh stories), who had served a notice of termination and a grant of rights similar to ms.milnes, and asserted
counterclaims against the company allegedly arising from the milne and hunt terminations and the grant of rights to dei for (a)unlawful and unfair business practices; and (b)breach of the 1983 licensing agreement.  on october19, 2006, the parties stipulated to ssis filing its fourth amended answer and counterclaims (fourth amended answer) seeking
(a)to invalidate the hunt termination notice, (b)to terminate the companys rights vis--vis ssi, and (c)damages in excess of two billion dollars, among other relief. that stipulation also provided that hunt and the
company need not respond to the fourth amended answer until the conclusion of two events: the state court appeal in stephen slesinger, inc. v. the walt disney company, and the trial in the district court on the validity of the hunt
termination notice. ssi then sought to withdraw both the fourth amended answer and its stipulation, but on november3, 2006, the court denied that request and ordered that the hunt termination trial commence on march20, 2007.
stephen slesinger, inc. v. the walt disney company. in this lawsuit, filed on february27, 1991 in the los angeles county superior court,
the plaintiff claims that a company subsidiary defrauded it and breached a 1983 licensing agreement with respect to certain winnie the pooh properties, by failing to account for and pay royalties on revenues earned from the sale of winnie the pooh
movies on videocassette and from the exploitation of winnie the pooh merchandising rights. the plaintiff seeks damages for the licensees alleged breaches as well as confirmation of the plaintiffs interpretation of the licensing agreement
with respect to future activities. the plaintiff also seeks the right to terminate the agreement on the basis of the alleged breaches. if each of the plaintiffs claims were to be confirmed in a final judgment, damages as argued by the
plaintiff could total as much as several hundred million dollars and adversely impact the value to the company of any future exploitation of the licensed rights. on march29, 2004, the court granted the companys motion for terminating
sanctions against the plaintiff for a host of discovery abuses, including the withholding, alteration, and theft of documents and other information, and, on april5, 2004, dismissed plaintiffs case with prejudice. plaintiffs
subsequent attempts to disqualify the judge who granted the terminating sanctions were denied in 2004, and its motion for a new trial was denied on january26, 2005, allowing plaintiff to proceed with its noticed appeal from the
april5, 2004, order of dismissal. argument of the appeal has not been scheduled.  in re pixar securities litigation. on
october21, 2005, a putative class action lawsuit was filed against pixar, steven p. jobs, edwin e. catmull and simon t. bax in the united states district court forthe northern district of california.in this case, together with
three subsequent cases which have been consolidated, plaintiffs allege that the defendants issued false and misleading statements in certain of pixars press releases and sec filings between january18, 2005 and june30, 2005,
concerning earnings pixar expected to receive for its second fiscal quarter of 2005, ended july2, 2005, from the home video sales of the incredibles.plaintiffs assert claims under section10(b) and 20(a) of the securities exchange
act of 1934, as amended, and rule 10b-5 promulgated thereunder.on

june29, 2006, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint, which was granted by order dated september12,2006. while the order
allowed plaintiffs 30 days to file an amended complaint, plaintiffs agreed not to do so, and the lawsuit was dismissed on october20, 2006, by stipulation of the parties.  in re the walt disney company derivative litigation. william and geraldine brehm and thirteen other individuals filed an amended and consolidated
complaint on may28, 1997 in the delaware court of chancery seeking, among other things, a declaratory judgment against each of the companys directors as of december 1996 that the companys 1995 employment agreement with its former
president michael s. ovitz, was void, or alternatively that mr.ovitzs termination should be deemed a termination for cause and any severance payments to him forfeited. on october8, 1998, the delaware court of chancery
dismissed all counts of the amended complaint. plaintiffs appealed, and on february9, 2000, the supreme court of delaware affirmed the dismissal but ruled also that plaintiffs should be permitted to file an amended complaint in accordance with
the courts opinion. the plaintiffs filed their amended complaint on january3, 2002. on february6, 2003, the companys directors motion to dismiss the amended complaint was converted by the court to a motion for summary
judgment and the plaintiffs were permitted to take discovery. the company and its directors answered the amended complaint on april1, 2003. on may28, 2003, the court (treating as a motion to dismiss the motion for summary judgment into
which it had converted the original motion on february6, 2003) denied the directors motion to dismiss the amended complaint. after trial, on august9, 2005, the delaware court of chancery issued an order entering judgment against
the plaintiffs and in favor of all defendants on all counts, which judgment was affirmed on june8, 2006, bythe delaware supreme court.  similar or identical claims were asserted in complaints filed by the same plaintiffs (other than william and geraldine brehm, james c. hays and barnett stepak) in the superior court of the state of california, los angeles county on and
after january3, 1997. those cases were dismissed on november28, 2005.  management believes that it is not currently possible to
estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of pending matters noted above will have on the companys results of operations, financial position, or cash flows.  the company, together with, in some instances, certain of its directors and officers, is a defendant or co-defendant in various other legal actions
involving copyright, breach of contract and various other claims incident to the conduct of its businesses. management does not expect the company to suffer any material liability by reason of such actions.
item4. submission of matters to a vote of security holders  no matters were submitted to a vote of
shareholders during the fourth quarter of the fiscal year covered by this report.
executive officers of the company  the executive officers of the company are elected each year at the

accounting changes
forward-looking statements  consolidated results  2006 vs. 2005  revenues for the year increased 7%,
or $2.3 billion, to $34.3 billion. the increase was primarily due to the following:
the performance at our domestic theme parks, led by the success of the 50th anniversary celebration of disneyland;
the strong box-office performance of pirates of the caribbean: dead mans chest, the chronicles of narnia: the lion, the witch and the wardrobe, and disney/pixars
cars;
higher affiliate revenues at espn due to contractual rate increases;
advertising revenue growth at the abc television network;
increased sales of touchstone television series; and
the first full year of theme park operations at hong kong disneyland as compared to the prior year when the park opened in mid-september 2005.  these increases were partially offset by a decline in dvd unit sales at home entertainment and fewer domestic miramax theatrical releases in the current
year.  net income increased 33%, or $841 million, to $3.4 billion due to lower distribution costs resulting from fewer miramax theatrical
releases, improved margins at worldwide home entertainment driven by reduced marketing and trade programs and lower distribution costs, the strong performance at both of our domestic theme parks, growth at espn, and improved primetime results at the
abc television network. diluted earnings per share for the year increased 34%, or $0.42, to $1.64, compared to the prior-year earnings per share of $1.22.

total diluted earnings per share impact for the year ended september30, 2006 and october1, 2005 does not equal the sum of the column due to rounding.
2005 vs. 2004  revenues
for fiscal 2005 increased 4%, or $1.2 billion, to $31.9 billion. the increase in revenues was due to growth at media networks and parks and resorts, partially offset by a decline at studio entertainment. the media networks growth was driven by
higher affiliate fees at cable networks and higher advertising revenues. the increase at parks and resorts was due to an additional six months of euro disney revenues in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004 as euro disneys results were
consolidated beginning in mid fiscal 2004 and higher occupied room nights, theme park attendance, and guest spending at the domestic resorts. the decline at studio entertainment was primarily due to an overall decline in dvd unit sales.
net income for the year increased 8%, or $188 million, to $2.5 billion. the increase in net incomewas primarily due to growth at media networks,
partially offset by a decrease at studio entertainment. additionally, we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no.123r, share based payment (sfas 123r), increasing expense for the year by $253 million ($160 million
after-tax or $0.08 per share). diluted earnings per share before the cumulative effect of an accounting change for the valuation of certain fcc licenses was $1.24, an increase of 11%, or $0.12, compared to the prior-year earnings per share of $1.12.
we adopted emerging issues task force topic d-108, use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill (eitf d-108), which resulted in a cumulative effect of accounting change totaling $57 million ($36 million
after-tax or $0.02 per share) relating to the valuation of certain fcc licenses (see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements). diluted earnings per share after the cumulative effect of the accounting change was $1.22.

the company evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on segment operating income
and management uses aggregate segment operating income as a measure of the overall performance of the operating businesses. the company believes that information about aggregate segment operating income assists investors by allowing them to evaluate
changes in the operating results of the companys portfolio of businesses separate from factors other than business operations that affect net income. the following table reconciles segment operating income to income before income taxes,
minority interests, and the cumulative effect of accounting change.

revenues  media networks revenues increased 11%, or $1.4 billion, to $14.6 billion, consisting of a 10% increase, or $739 million, at the cable networks and a 12% increase, or $692 million, at broadcasting.  increased cable networks revenues were primarily due to growth of $478 million from cable and satellite operators and $188 million in advertising
revenues. revenues from cable and satellite operators are generally derived from fees charged on a per subscriber basis, and the increase in the current year was due to contractual rate increases and, to a lesser extent subscriber growth at espn.
increased advertising revenue was due to higher ratings and rates at espn.  the companys contractual arrangements with cable and
satellite operators are renewed or renegotiated from time to time in the ordinary course of business. certain of these arrangements are currently in negotiation.
-35-
table of contents
consolidation in the cable and satellite distribution industry and other factorsmay adversely affect the companys ability to obtain and maintain
contractual terms for the distribution of its various cable and satellite programming services that are as favorable as those currently in place. if this were to occur, revenues from cable networks could increase at slower rates than in the past or
could stabilize or decline. certain of the companys existing contracts with cable and satellite operators as well as contracts in negotiation include annual live programming commitments. in these cases, revenues subject to the commitments,
which are generally collected ratably over the year, are deferred until the annual commitments are satisfied, which generally results in higher revenue recognition in the second half of the year.  the increase in broadcasting revenues was due to growth at the abc television network and increased sales of touchstone television series. the growth at
the abc television network was primarily due to an increase in primetime advertising revenues resulting from higher rates, strong upfront sales, and continued strength in ratings. the abc television network also experienced increased advertising
revenues from the super bowl, partially offset by lower advertising revenues from the absence of monday night football (mnf) which moved to espn. increased sales of touchstone television series reflected higher international syndication and dvd
sales of hit dramas lost, greys anatomy, and desperate housewives, as well as higher third party license fees led by scrubs, which completed its fifth season of network television.  costs and expenses  costs and expenses, which consist
primarily of programming rights costs, production costs, participation costs, distribution and marketing expenses, labor costs, and general and administrative costs, increased 10%, or $1.0 billion, to $11.5 billion consisting of a 10% increase, or
$474 million, at the cable networks, and a 10% increase, or $540 million, at broadcasting. the increase at cable networks was primarily due to increased costs at espn driven by higher programming costs from the new major league baseball (mlb) and
national football league (nfl) long-term license agreements and an additional nfl game. espn also incurred higher costs for its branded mobile phone services, which the company recently announced would be transitioned into its existing wireless
licensing business, and higher general and administrative expenses. the increase in broadcasting was due to higher programming expenses at the abc television network, increased production and distribution costs related to the sale of touchstone
television series, higher costs at the internet operations and radio, and the increased number and costs of pilot productions. the increase in programming expenses at the abc television network reflected costs related to the super bowl partially
offset by the absence of costs from monday night football in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2006. the cost increase at the internet operations was primarily due to the launch of disney branded mobile phone services as well as costs of other new
initiatives. higher costs at radio included an impairment charge related to fcc licenses, primarily associated with espn radio stations, reflecting an overall market decline in certain radio markets in which we operate. see note 2 to the
consolidated financial statements for further information.  sports programming costs  the company has various contractual commitments for the purchase of television rights for sports and other programming, including the national basketball
association (nba), nfl, mlb, nascar, and various college football and basketball conferences and football bowl games. the costs of these contracts have increased significantly in recent years. we enter into these contractual commitments with the
expectation that, over the life of the contracts, revenue from advertising during the programming and affiliate fees will exceed the costs of the programming. while contract costs may initially exceed incremental revenues and negatively impact
operating income, it is our expectation that the combined value to our networks from all of these contracts will result in long-term benefits. the actual impact of these contracts on the companys results over the term of the contracts is
dependent upon a number of factors, including the strength of advertising markets, effectiveness of marketing efforts, and the size of viewer audiences.  in february 2003, the companys nfl contract was extended for an additional three years ending with the telecast of the 2006 pro bowl. the aggregate fee for the three-year period was $3.7 billion. the
implementation of the contract extension resulted in a $180 million reduction in nfl programming costs at espn in fiscal 2004 as compared to fiscal 2003. the majority of this decrease was in the first quarter of fiscal 2004. these costs were
relatively level in fiscal 2005 and 2006. cash payments under the contract were $0.9 billion for fiscal 2006 and $1.2 billion for both fiscal 2005 and 2004.
-36-
table of contents
in april 2005, the company entered into a new agreement with the nfl for the right to broadcastnfl
monday night football games on espn. the contract provides for total payments of approximately $8.9 billion over an eight-year period, commencing with the 2006-2007 season. the payment terms of the new contract provide for average increases in the
annual payments of approximately 4%per year. our expense recognition of the costs of the new contract reflect this payment schedule. the company has rights to 21 games in the 2006-2007 season, which began in the fourth quarter of the
companys fiscal year 2006.  segment operating income  segment operating income increased 12%, or $401 million, to $3.6 billion for the year due to an increase of $259 million at the cable networks and an increase of $142 million at broadcasting. the increase at the cable
networks was primarily due to growth at espn. the increase at broadcasting was due to improved primetime performance at the abc television network and increased sales of touchstone television series, partially offset by higher costs at internet
group and radio, and the increased number and costs of pilot productions. also included in segment operating income is income from equity investees of $444 million for the twelve months ended september30, 2006 compared to $460 million for the
prior year period.  abc radio transaction  on february 6, 2006, the company and citadel broadcasting corporation (citadel) announced an agreement to merge the abc radio business, which consists of 22 of the companys owned radio stations and the abc radio network, with citadel.
the espn radio and radio disney networks and station businesses are not included in the transaction. the merger is expected to occur after the abc radio business is distributed to disney shareholders (the distribution). the agreement was
subsequently amended on november 19, 2006. under the amended terms, (i) disneys stockholders are expected to collectively hold approximately 57% of citadels common stock post-merger and (ii) the company would retain between $1.10 billion
and $1.35 billion in cash, depending upon the market price of citadels common stock over a measurement period ending prior to the closing. this cash will be obtained from loan proceeds raised by abc radio from a third party lender prior to the
distribution. based on citadels stock price on november 20, 2006, the company estimates that the aggregate value of the retained cash and citadel common stock to be received by disney shareholders would be approximately $2.5 billion. the
amended agreement provides that the closing will occur no earlier than may 31, 2007, subject to regulatory approvals, and that either party may terminate the agreement if the closing does not occur by june 15, 2007.  subsequent eventsale of e! entertainment television  on november 21, 2006, in connection with the execution of new long-term agreements for the provision of programming to cable service provider comcast corporation (comcast), the company sold its 39.5% interest in e!entertainment
television (e!) to comcast (which owned the remainder of the interests in e!) for $1.2 billion, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.8 billion ($0.5 billion after-tax), which will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
parks and resorts  revenues  revenues at parks and resorts increased 10%, or $902 million, to $9.9 billion due to increases of $647 million at our domestic resorts and a net increase
of $255 million at our international resorts.  domestic parks and resorts  at our domestic parks and resorts, increased revenues were due to increased guest spending, theme park attendance, and hotel occupancy, as well as higher
sales at disney vacation club. higher guest spending was due to a higher average daily hotel room rate, higher average ticket prices, and greater merchandise spending at both resorts. increases in attendance and hotel occupancy were led bythe
50th anniversary celebration at both domestic resorts, which concluded at the end of september 2006.

per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on
food, beverages and merchandise at the hotels.  international parks and resorts  international revenue growth reflected the first full year of theme park operations at hong kong disneyland resort as compared to the prior year when the
park opened in mid-september 2005. disneyland resort paris also experienced increased revenues, however this increase was more than offset by the unfavorable impact of foreign currency translation as a result of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar
against the euro.  costs and expenses  costs and expenses increased 7%, or $547 million primarily due to increased volume-related costs and costs associated with new guest offerings and attractions at the domestic resorts, and higher operating costs at hong kong disneyland
resort reflecting a full year of theme park operations. these increases were partially offset by the absence of pre-opening costs at hong kong disneyland resort, lower costs at disneyland resort paris due to the favorable impact of foreign currency
translation adjustments as a result of the strengthening of the u.s. dollar against the euro, and the benefit from adjustments to actuarially determined workers compensation and guest claims liabilities based on favorable claims experience at the
domestic resorts.  segment operating income  segment operating income increased 30%, or $356 million, to $1.5 billion primarily due to continued strength at both domestic resorts, led by the success of the 50th anniversary celebration, thefirst year of operations at hong kong
disneyland resort, and improvements at disneyland resort paris.  studio entertainment  revenues  revenues decreased 1%, or $58 million, to $7.5 billion primarily due to a decrease of $578
million in worldwide home entertainment partially offset by an increase of $415 million in worldwide theatrical motion picture distribution, and an increase of $60 million in music distribution.  lower worldwide home entertainment revenues were primarily due to a decline in unit sales resulting from a higher number of strong performing titles in
the prior year partially offset by increased sales of television dvd box-sets and reduced marketing and trade programs. significant current year titles included the chronicles of narnia: the lion, the witch and the wardrobe, cinderella
platinum release, and chicken little, while prior-year titles included disney/pixars the incredibles, national treasure, aladdin platinum release, and bambi platinum release.  the increase in worldwide theatrical motion picture distribution revenues was primarily due to the strong box-office performance of pirates of the
caribbean: dead mans chest, the chronicles of narnia: the lion, the witch and the wardrobe, and disney/pixars cars compared to the prior-year titles, which included the incredibles and national treasure.
the increase was partially offset by lower revenue resulting from fewer domestic miramax theatrical releases in the current year.

costs and expenses  costs and expenses, which consist primarily of production cost amortization, distribution and marketing expenses, product costs, and participation costs, decreased 8%, or $580 million. lower costs and expenses were
primarily due to a decrease in worldwide home entertainment, partially offset by increases in worldwide theatrical motion picture distribution and higher music distribution expenses.  the decline in costs and expenses at worldwide home entertainment was primarily due to reduced marketing expenditures, lower production cost amortization
driven by decreased unit sales, and lower distribution costs driven in part by fewer returns.  higher costs and expenses in worldwide
theatrical motion picture distribution were primarily due to increases in distribution costs, production cost amortization and participation costs. the increase in distribution costs was driven by higher profile films in the current year that had
more extensive marketing campaigns to launch the films. higher production cost amortization and participation costs were driven by the strong performance of pirates of the caribbean: dead mans chest and the chronicles of narnia: the
lion, the witch and the wardrobe. these increases were partially offset by lower costs and expenses resulting from fewer domestic miramax theatrical releases in the current year.  segment operating income  segment operating income increased $522 million, to $729 million, primarily
due to improvements in worldwide theatrical motion picture distribution and worldwide home entertainment.  film financing  in august 2005, the company entered into a film financing arrangement with a group of investors whereby the investors will fund up to approximately $500
million for 40% of the production and marketing costs of a slate of up to thirty-two live-action films, excluding certain titles such as the chronicles of narnia: the lion, the witch and the wardrobe and, in general, sequels to previous
films, in return for approximately 40% of the future net cash flows generated by these films. by entering into this transaction, the company is able to share the risks and rewards of the performance of its live-action film production and
distribution activity with outside investors. as of september30, 2006, the investors have participated in the funding of thirteen films. the cumulative investment in the slate by the investors, net of the cash flows generated by the slate that
are returned to the investors, is classified as borrowings. interest expense recognized from these borrowings is variable and is determined using the effective interest method based on the projected profitability of the film slate.  pixar acquisition  on may5, 2006, the company
acquired pixar in an all-stock transaction and pixar became a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company. as a result of the acquisition, the company now produces feature animation films under both the disney and pixar banners. additional information
regarding the acquisition of pixar is set forth in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements and in item1a  risk factors, above.  consumer products  revenues  revenues increased 3%, or $66 million, to $2.2 billion, primarily due to increases of $112 million at buena vista games and $91 million at merchandise licensing. these increases were partially offset by a decrease of $106 million at the
disney stores primarily due to the sale of the disney store north america chain in the first quarter of 2005.  sales growth at buena vista
games was due to the release of self-published titles based on the chronicles of narnia: the lion, the witch and the wardrobe, chicken little, and pirates of the caribbean. sales growth at merchandise licensing was driven by
higher earned royalties across multiple product categories, led by the strong performance of cars, disney princess, and pirates of the caribbean merchandise.

table of contents
costs and expenses  costs and expenses were essentially flat at $1.6 billion as decreases at the disney stores were offset by increases at buena vista games. the decreases in costs and expenses at the disney stores were primarily due to
the sale of the disney store north america chain in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. costs and expenses increased at buena vista games due to higher costs of goods sold driven by increased volumes, increased product development spending on both
current and future titles, and higher marketing expenditures.  segment operating income  segment operating income increased 14%, or $75 million, to $618 million, due to growth at merchandise licensing, partially offset by a decrease at buena
vista games. growth at merchandise licensing was due to higher earned royalties across multiple product categories. the decrease at buena vista games was driven by increased product development spending on future self-published titles.
subsequent event  sale of us weekly  on
october2, 2006, the company sold its 50 percent stake in us weekly for $300 million, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $270 million ($170 million after-tax), which will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.

interest expense increased 17% for the year primarily due to higher interest expense at hong kong
disneyland and higher effective interest rates and average debt balances. during the prior year, hong kong disneylands interest expense was capitalized when the park was under construction.  interest and investment income for the year increased due to a $42 million write-down in the prior year of an investment in a company that licenses
technology to the moviebeam venture and increased interest income from higher cash balances.  effective income tax rate  the effective income tax rate increased 3.6 percentage points from 31.1% in 2005 to 34.7% in 2006. the lower effective tax rate for the prior year
reflected a greater release of reserves as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters and the benefit from a one-time deduction permitted under the american jobs creation act of 2004 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings.
pension and benefit costs  pension
and postretirement medical benefit plan costs affect results in all of our segments, with the majority of these costs being borne by the parks and resorts segment. the company recognized pension and postretirement medical benefit plan expenses of
$462 million, $314 million, and $374 million for fiscal years ended 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. the increase in fiscal 2006 was due primarily to a decrease in the discount rate used to measure the present value of plan obligations. the
discount rate assumption decreased from 6.30% to 5.25%, reflecting trends in prevailing market interest rates at our june30, 2005 valuation date.
-40-
table of contents
we expect pension and postretirement medical costs to decrease to $273 million in fiscal 2007 with
approximately one-half of these costs being borne by the parks and resorts segment. the decrease is primarily due to an increase in the discount rate assumption from 5.25% to 6.40%, reflecting increases in prevailing market interest rates on our
june30, 2006 valuation date. the assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. the companys discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension
yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds. the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves.  during fiscal 2006, the company contributed approximately $400 million to its pension and postretirement medical plans, which included voluntary
contributions above the minimum requirements for the pension plans. based on the january1, 2006 funding valuation, the company is not required to make any contributions to its pension plans during fiscal 2007. the company currently expects to
contribute, at a minimum, $19 million to its pension and postretirement medical plans during fiscal 2007. the company may make additional contributions into its pension plans in fiscal 2007 depending on how the funded status of those plans change
and as we gain more clarity with respect to the pension protection act of 2006 (ppa) that was signed into law on august17, 2006. the united states treasury department is in the process of developing implementation guidance for the ppa;
however, it is likely the ppa will accelerate minimum funding requirements beginning in fiscal 2009. the company may choose to pre-fund some of this anticipated funding.  pension obligations exceed plan assets for a number of our pension plans. in this situation, the accounting rules require that we record an additional minimum pension liability. the minimum pension liability
adjustment at year end fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005 is as follows (in millions):

the decrease in the minimum pension liability in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to the increase
inthe discount rate from 5.25% to 6.40%. the accounting rules do not require that changes in the additional minimum pension liability adjustment be recorded in current period earnings, but rather they are recorded directly to equity through
accumulated other comprehensive income. expense recognition under the pension accounting rules is based upon long-term trends over the expected life of the companys workforce. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements for further
discussion.  in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no.158, employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other
postretirement plans, an amendment of fasb statements no.87, 88, 106, and 132(r) (sfas 158). see note2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  business segment results  2005 vs. 2004  media networks  revenues  media networks revenues increased 12%, or
$1.4 billion, to $13.2 billion, consisting of a 13% increase, or $852 million, at the cable networks and an 11% increase, or $577 million, at broadcasting.  increased cable networks revenues were primarily due to growth of $690 million from cable andsatellite operators and $172 million in advertising revenues. revenues from cable and satellite operators are
generally derived from fees charged on a per subscriber basis, and the increase in the current year was due to contractual rate increases and subscriber growth at espn and the disney channels. increased advertising revenue was due to higher rates at
espn and higher ratings at abc family.
-41-
table of contents
increased broadcasting revenues were due to growth at the abc television network and television
production and distribution. abc television network revenues increased primarily due to higher primetime advertising revenue resulting from higher ratings and advertising rates. the growth at television production and distribution was driven by
higher license fee revenues from domestic markets as a result of the syndication of my wife and kids and higher revenue in international markets from sales of desperate housewives and lost.  costs and expenses  costs and expenses, consisting
primarily of programming rights costs, production costs, participation costs, distribution and marketing expenses, labor costs, and general and administrative costs, increased 9%, or $849 million, to $10.5 billion consisting of an 11% increase, or
$491 million, at the cable networks, and a 7% increase, or $358 million, at broadcasting. the increase at cable networks was driven by increases at espn from higher general and administrative expenses, increased production costs, and investments in
new business initiatives, including espn branded mobile phone services. higher general and administrative expenses, programming expenses, and marketing costs at the disney channels also contributed to the increase at cable networks. the increase at
broadcasting was driven by higher production and participation costs at tv production and distribution. the adoption of sfas 123r increased expenses in fiscal year 2005 at cable networks and at broadcasting by $36 million and $64 million,
respectively.  segment operating income  segment operating income increased 25%, or $635 million, to $3.2 billion for the year due to an increase of $416 million at the cable networks and an increase of $219 million at broadcasting. the increase at cable networks was due to growth
at espn from higher affiliate revenues and advertising revenues, partially offset by higher costs and expenses at espn. additionally, equity in the income of investees at cable networks increased $55 million driven by higher affiliate revenue at
lifetime television. the increase at broadcasting was driven by higher primetime advertising revenues at the abc television network and higher license fee revenues from syndication of my wife and kids and international sales of lost
and desperate housewives at television production and distribution.  moviebeam  the company launched moviebeam, an on-demand electronic movie rental service in three domestic cities in october 2003. the company suspended service in
april 2005 while evaluating its go-forward business model and negotiating a refinancing of the business with strategic and financial investors. based on negotiations with investors, the company concluded that any such refinancing would not be
sufficient to recover all of its investment related to the moviebeam venture and recognized $56 million ($35 million after-tax or $0.02 per share) of impairment charges during the year ended october1, 2005. in january 2006, the company
completed a refinancing transaction with outside investors that resulted in the company retaining only a minority interest in the moviebeam venture.  parks and resorts  revenues  revenues at parks and resorts increased 16%, or $1.3 billion, to $9.0 billion. the company began consolidating the results of euro disney and hong kong disneyland at the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2004, which resulted in
fiscal 2004 segment results including only six months of operations of these businesses while fiscal 2005 includes a full year of operations. the impact of fiscal 2005 including an additional six months of operations as compared to fiscal 2004
accounted for an 8% or $672 million increase in parks and resorts revenue for the year that represents the revenues of euro disney and hong kong disneyland for the first half of fiscal 2005. excluding the impact of including the additional six
months of euro disney and hong kong disneyland operations, fiscal 2005 revenues grew 8%, or $601 million, primarily due to growth of $364 million at the walt disney world resort and $213 million at the disneyland resort.  at the walt disney world resort, increased revenues were due to higher occupied room nights, theme park attendance and guest spending, and increased
sales at disneys vacation club. increased occupied room nights reflected increased visitation to the resort reflecting the ongoing recovery in travel and tourism, the popularity of disney as a travel destination, and the availability of
additional rooms in both the first and second quarters of the prior year. during the third quarter, the company launched two programs, disneys magical express and extra

magic hours, which were designed to increase occupancy at the walt disney world hotels. increased theme park attendance reflected increased
international and domestic guest visitation, driven by the happiest celebration on earth promotion which celebrates the 50th anniversary of disneyland. higher guest spending was primarily due to higher food and beverage purchases, ticket
price increases, and fewer promotional offers compared to the prior year.  at the disneyland resort, increased revenues were driven by
higher guest spending and attendance at the theme parks due to increased ticket prices and the 50th anniversary celebration, respectively.  the following table presents attendance, per capita theme park guest spending, and hotel statistics for our domestic properties:

per room guest spending consists of the average daily hotel room rate as well as guest spending on
food, beverages, and merchandise at the hotels.  the increase in available room nights was primarily due to the opening of disneys
pop century resort, which has approximately 2,900 rooms, late in the first quarter of fiscal 2004 and the re-opening of approximately 1,000 rooms in the french quarter portion of the port orleans hotel in the second quarter of fiscal 2004. per room

months of euro disney and hong kong disneyland operations, which accounted for an 11% or $722 million increase in costs and expenses for the year. in addition, the adoption of sfas 123r increased expenses by $42 million in fiscal year 2005. the
remaining increase of $454 million was primarily due to higher costs at walt disney world and disneyland and increased pre-opening costs at hong kong disneyland. walt disney world incurred higher volume-related expenses, increased costs associated
with new attractions and service programs, information technology, and higher fixed costs. disneyland incurred higher volume-related expenses, increased marketing and sales costs due to the 50th anniversary celebration, and higher fixed costs.
segment operating income  segment
operating income increased 9%, or $101 million, to $1.2 billion primarily due to growth at the walt disney world and disneyland resort. these increases were partially offset by higher pre-opening expenses at hong kong disneyland in the second half
of the year and stock option expense associated with the adoption of sfas 123r in fiscal year 2005.  studio entertainment  revenues  revenues decreased 13%, or $1.1 billion, to
$7.6 billion, primarily due to a decrease of $1.1 billion in worldwide home entertainment. the decline in revenues at worldwide home entertainment was due to an overall decline in dvd unit sales resulting from a lower performing slate of current
year titles, including a decline in the ratio of home video unit sales to the related total domestic box-office results for feature films. successful current year titles included the incredibles, national treasure, bambi platinum release, and
aladdin platinum release, while the prior year included disney/pixars finding nemo, pirates of the caribbean: the curse of the black pearl, and the lion king platinum release.
-43-
table of contents
costs and expenses  costs and expenses decreased 8%, or $671 million, due to lower costs in worldwide theatrical motion picture distribution and in worldwide home entertainment. the decline in costs and expenses at worldwide theatrical
distribution was primarily due to lower distribution costs and lower production cost amortization. distribution costs were lower as the prior year included higher profile films that had extensive marketing campaigns to launch the films. the decrease
in production cost amortization was driven by lower film cost write-offs. these cost decreases were partially offset by increased production cost amortization, and distribution costs at miramax due to an increased number of releases and higher
write-offs. lower costs in worldwide home entertainment were primarily due to lower distribution costs, production cost amortization, and participation costs. distribution costs and production cost amortization were lower as a result of decreased
unit sales. participation costs were lower as the prior year included finding nemo and pirates of the caribbean: the curse of the black pearl, which had higher participation costs due to better performance than current year titles.
pixar received an equal share of profits (after distribution fees) as co-producer of finding nemo and the incredibles. the adoption of sfas 123r increased expenses by $41 million in fiscal year 2005.  segment operating income  segment operating income
decreased 69%, or $455 million, to $207 million, primarily due to lower overall unit sales in worldwide home entertainment and a decline at miramax, partially offset by better performance in worldwide theatrical motion picture distribution.
miramax  in march 2005, the company
entered into agreements with miramax co-chairmen, bob and harvey weinstein, and their new production company. pursuant to those agreements, the company, among other things, substantially resolved all economic issues relating to the weinsteins
existing employment agreements; terminated the weinsteins then-existing employment agreements and entered into revised employment agreements with them through september30, 2005; sold interests in certain films in various stages of
production to the weinsteins new company; and provided it with the opportunity to acquire certain development projects, as well as sequel rights to certain library product. the company retains certain co-financing, distribution, and
participation rights in several of these properties. the company also retains the miramax and dimension film libraries and the name miramax films, while the weinsteins took the dimension name to their new company. no material charges
were recorded as a result of the execution of the agreements.  consumer products  revenues  revenues decreased 15%, or $384 million, to $2.1 billion, primarily due to a decrease of
$543 million as a result of the sale of the disney store north america in the first quarter of fiscal 2005. thisdecrease was partially offset by increases at merchandise licensing and buena vista games of $118million and $53 million,
respectively.  the increase in merchandise licensing was due to higher revenues across multiple product categories and recognition of
contractual minimum guarantee revenues that increased by $49 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004. the increase at buena vista games was due to the performance of the incredibles licensed products, recognition of contractual minimum
guarantee revenue, which increased by $17 million in fiscal 2005 compared to fiscal 2004, and higher sales of game boy advance games.  costs and
expenses  costs and expenses decreased 19%, or $370 million, to $1.6 billion, due to a decrease of $528 million related to the sale of
the disney store north america chain, partially offset by higher product development spending at buena vista games, increased operating expenses at merchandise licensing, and $20 million of stock option expense associated with the adoption of sfas
123r in fiscal year 2005.  segment operating income  segment operating income decreased 1%, or $4 million, to $543 million, primarily due to lower operating income at the disney store, partially offset by growth in merchandise licensing.

$100 million for the working capital transferred to the buyer at the closing of the transaction. during fiscal 2005, the company recorded a loss on the working capital that was transferred to the buyer and additional restructuring and impairment
charges related to the sale (primarily for employee retention and severance and lease termination costs) totaling $32million. pursuant to the terms of sale, the disney store north america retained its lease obligations related to the stores

aircraft leveraged lease charges increased as a result of the write-off of our leveraged-lease investment with delta air lines, inc.
(delta) after deltas bankruptcy filing in september 2005. in fiscal 2004, we took a partial write-down of our investment with delta consistent with our agreement with delta to reduce lease payments. in the event of a material modification to
the remaining delta aircraft leases or foreclosure of the delta aircraft by the debt holders, certain tax payments of up to $40 million, as of september30, 2006, could be accelerated. the expected tax payments are currently reflected on our
balance sheet as a deferred tax liability and are not expected to result in a further charge to earnings.  fiscal year 2005 interest and
investment income included $19 million in gains from the sales of investments.

net interest expense was also impacted by a $61 million gain (primarily non-cash) that was recorded by
euro disney as a result of the restructuring of euro disneys borrowings. see note 5 to theconsolidated financial statements.  effective
income tax rate  the effective income tax rate decreased 0.9 percentage points from 32.0% in 2004 to 31.1% in 2005. the effective tax
rates reflect the release of reserves as a result of the favorable resolution of certain tax matters in both fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004. in addition, fiscal 2005 reflects the favorable impact of a one-time deduction under the american jobs creation
act of 2004 related to the repatriation of foreign earnings.  liquidity and capital resources  cash and cash equivalents increased by $688 million during the year ended september30, 2006. the change in cash and cash equivalents is as follows:

television production costs include all internally produced content such as live action and animated feature films, animated direct-to-video programming, television series, television specials, theatrical stage plays, or other similar product.
programming costs include film or television product licensed for a specific period from third parties for airing on the companys broadcast, cable networks, and television stations. programming assets are generally recorded when the
programming becomes available to us with a corresponding increase in programming liabilities. accordingly, we analyze our programming assets net of the related liability.

capital expenditures for the parks and resorts segment are principally for theme park and
resortexpansion, new rides and attractions and recurring capital and capital improvements. the decrease in capital expenditures was primarily due to lower investment at hong kong disneyland resulting from substantial completion of the park
prior to its opening in september 2005, as well as lower expenditures at the domestic theme parks due to increased investment in the prior year in preparation for the disneyland 50th anniversary celebration.  capital expenditures
at media networks primarily reflect investments in facilities and equipment for expanding and upgrading broadcast centers, production facilities, and television station facilities.  corporate and unallocated shared capital expenditures were primarily for information technology software and hardware.  other investing activities  during fiscal 2006, $1.1
billion of investments were liquidated and the sales of a cable television equity investment and a magazine business generated $81 million. in addition, the company purchased $82 million of financial investments.  during fiscal 2005, the company received $100 million for working capital transferred to the buyer of the disney store north america and $29 million from
the sale of the mighty ducks of anaheim.  during fiscal 2004, the company purchased $67 million of financial investments, made
$46million of equity contributions to hong kong disneyland in the first six months of the year prior toconsolidation, and acquired the film library and intellectual property rights for the muppets and bearin the big blue
house for $68 million ($45 million in cash).  financing activities  cash used in financing activities during fiscal 2006 of $5.1 billion reflected share repurchases and payment of dividends to shareholders, partially
offset by an increase in borrowings and the proceeds from stock option exercises.  during the year ended september30, 2006, the
companys borrowing activity was as follows:

in february 2006, the company amended its two bank facilities. the amendments included an
extension of the maturity of one of the facilities from 2009 to 2011. in addition, the company also increased the amount of letters of credit that can be issued to $800 million from $500 million under the facility expiring in 2011, which if
utilized, reduces available borrowing under this facility. as of september30, 2006, $261 million of letters of credit had been issued, of which $213 million was issued under the facilities. these bank facilities allow for borrowings at
libor-based rates plus a spread, which depends on the companys public debt rating and can range from 0.175% to 0.75%. as of september30, 2006, the company had not borrowed under these bank facilities.  the company may use commercial paper borrowings up to the amount of its above unused bank facilities, in conjunction with term debt issuance and
operating cash flow, to retire or refinance other borrowings before or as they come due.  as of the filing date of this report, the board
of directors had not yet declared a dividend related to fiscal 2006. the company paid a $519 million dividend ($0.27 per share) during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 related to fiscal 2005; paid a $490 million dividend ($0.24 per share) during
the second quarter of fiscal 2005 related to fiscal 2004; and paid a $430 million dividend ($0.21 per share) during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 related to fiscal 2003.  during fiscal 2006, the company repurchased 243million shares of disney common stock for approximately $6.9 billion. during fiscal 2005, the
company repurchased 91million shares of disney common stock for $2.4 billion. during fiscal 2004, the company repurchased 15million shares of disney common stock for approximately $335 million. as of september30, 2006, the company
had authorization in place to repurchase approximately 206million additional shares. the repurchase program does not have an expiration date.  we believe that the companys financial condition is strong and that its cash balances, other liquid assets, operating cash flows, access to debt and equity capital markets and borrowing capacity, taken together, provide adequate
resources to fund ongoing operating requirements and future capital expenditures related to the expansion of existing businesses and development of new projects. however, the companys operating cash flow and access to the capital markets can
be impacted by macroeconomic factors outside of its control. in addition to macroeconomic factors, the companys borrowing costs can be impacted by short and long-term debt ratings assigned by independent rating agencies, which are based, in
significant part, on the companys performance as measured by certain credit metrics such as interest coverage and leverage ratios. as of september30, 2006, moodys investors services long and short-term debt ratings for the
company were a3 and p-2, respectively, with stable outlook; and standard& poors long and short-term debt ratings for the company were a-and a-2, respectively, with stable outlook. the companys bank facilities contain only
one financial covenant, relating to interest coverage, which the company met on september30, 2006, by a significant margin. the companys bank facilities also specifically exclude certain entities, such as euro disney and hong kong
disneyland, from any representations, covenants, or events of default.  beginning in fiscal year 2006, hong kong disneyland is subject to
semi-annual financial performance covenants under its commercial term loan and revolving credit facility agreement. the commercial term loan had a balance of approximately $293 million on september 30, 2006. the revolving credit facility has not
been drawn on to date. in july 2006, lenders under the commercial term loan and revolving credit facility agreement provided a waiver to these covenants for the september 30, 2006 and march 31, 2007 measurement dates. the revolving credit facility
will not be available for the period the waiver is in effect unless the covenants are, in fact, satisfied during the period. the covenants will be in effect for the september 30, 2007 measurement date.

euro disney has covenants under its debt agreements that limit its investing and financing activities.
beginning with fiscal year 2006, euro disney must also meet financial performance covenants that necessitate earnings growth. as a result of revenue growth in excess of increases in costs and expenses during fiscal year 2006, management believes
that euro disney is in compliance with the covenants for fiscal 2006. pursuant to the debt agreements, compliance with the covenants is subject to final third-party confirmation.  there can be no assurance that the covenants referred to in the prior two paragraphs will be met for any particular measurement period. to the extent
that conditions are such that the covenants appear unlikely to be met, management would pursue measures to meet the covenants, including increasing revenues or reducing expenses, or would seek to obtain waivers from the debt holders.  contractual obligations, commitments and off balance sheet arrangements  the company has various contractual obligations which are recorded as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements. other items, such as certain purchase commitments and other executory contracts are not
recognized as liabilities in our consolidated financial statements but are required to be disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements. for example, the company is contractually committed to acquire broadcast programming and make certain
minimum lease payments for the use of property under operating lease agreements.  the following table summarizes our significant
contractual obligations and commitments on anundiscounted basis at september30, 2006 and the future periods in which such obligations are expected to be settled in cash. in addition, the table reflects the timing of principal and
interest payments on outstanding borrowings. additional details regarding these obligations are provided in footnotes to the financial statements, as referenced in the table:

information technology outsourcing  the company entered into agreements with two suppliers to outsource certain information technology functions and support services. the transition of services to the new suppliers began in late july 2005. the terms of
these agreements extend five to seven years with an option for the company to extend for an additional two to three years. the company has retained all responsibility and authority for systems architecture, technology strategy, and product standards
under the agreements. payments under these agreements are excluded from the table above because the payments vary depending on usage, but the company currently anticipates spending approximately $1.4 billion for these services over the next six
years.  dvd manufacturing arrangement  the company has a sole-source arrangement with a third-party manufacturer to meet the companys dvd manufacturing and warehousing requirements in the united states and a number of international markets that expires december31,
2006. payments under this arrangement are excluded from the table above since there are neither fixed nor minimum quantities under the arrangement. total payments for fiscal 2006 were approximately $0.5 billion.  legal and tax matters  as disclosed in notes 8 and 14
to the consolidated financial statements, the company has exposure for certain legal and tax matters.  accounting policies and estimates
we believe that the application of the following accounting policies, which are important to our financial position and results of operations, require
significant judgments and estimates on the part of management. for a summary of our significant accounting policies, including the accounting policies discussed below, see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements.  film and television revenues and costs  we expense
the cost of film and television productions over the applicable product life cycle based upon the ratio of the current periods gross revenues to the estimated remaining total gross revenues (ultimate revenues) for each production. if our
estimate of ultimate revenues decreases, amortization of film and television costs will be accelerated. conversely, if estimates of ultimate revenues increase, film and television cost amortization will be slowed. for film productions, ultimate
revenues include revenues from all sources that will be earned within ten years of the date of the initial theatrical release. for television series, we include revenues that will be earned within ten years of the delivery of the first episode, or
if still in production, five years from the date of delivery of the most recent episode, if later. for acquired film libraries, remaining revenues include amounts to be earned for up to twenty years from the date of acquisition.  with respect to films intended for theatrical release, the most sensitive factor affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues (and therefore affecting
film cost amortization and/or impairment) is domestic theatrical performance. revenues derived from other markets subsequent to the domestic theatrical release (e.g. the home video or international theatrical markets) have historically been highly
correlated with domestic theatrical performance. domestic theatrical performance varies primarily based upon the public interest and demand for a particular film, the quality of competing films at the time of release, as well as the level of
marketing effort. upon a films release and determination of domestic theatrical performance, the companys estimates of revenues from succeeding windows and markets are revised based on historical relationships. the most sensitive factor
affecting our estimate of ultimate revenues for released films is the extent of home entertainment sales achieved. home entertainment sales vary based on the volume and quality of competing home video products as well as the manner in which
retailers market and price our products.  with respect to television series or other television productions intended for broadcast, the
most sensitive factor affecting estimates of ultimate revenues is the programs rating. program ratings, which are an indication of market acceptance, directly affect the companys ability to generate advertising revenues during the airing
of the program. in addition, television series with greater market acceptance are more likely to generate incremental
-51-
table of contents
revenues through the eventual sale of the program rights in syndication. alternatively, poor ratings may result in a television series cancellation, which
would require the immediate write-off of any unamortized production costs.  we expense the cost of television broadcast rights for acquired
movies, series, and other programs based on the number of times the program is expected to be aired. amortization of these television programming assets is accelerated if we reduce the estimated future airings and slowed if we increase the estimated
future airings. the number of future airings of a particular program is impacted primarily by the programs ratings in previous airings, expected advertising rates, and availability and quality of alternative programming. accordingly, planned
usage is reviewed periodically and revised if necessary. rights costs for multi-year sports programming arrangements are amortized based upon the ratio of the current periods gross revenues to ultimate revenues (the projected revenue method)
or on a straight line basis, as appropriate. gross revenues include both advertising revenues and an allocation of affiliate fees. if the annual contractual payments related to each season over the term of a multi-year sports programming arrangement
approximate each seasons rights cost based on the projected revenue method, we expense the related annual payments during the applicable season. if ultimate revenues change significantly from projections, rights costs amortization may be
accelerated or slowed.  costs of film and television productions and programming rights for our broadcast businesses and cable networks are
subject to valuation adjustments pursuant to applicable accounting rules. the net realizable value of the television broadcast program licenses and rights are reviewed using a daypart methodology. a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs
broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. the companys dayparts are: early morning, daytime, late night, primetime, news, children, and sports (includes network and cable). the net realizable values of other
cable programming assets are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel. estimated values are based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions. if actual demand or market conditions are less favorable than our
projections, film, television, and programming cost write-downs may be required.  revenue recognition  the company has revenue recognition policies for its various operating segments that are appropriate to the circumstances of each business. see note 2 to
the consolidated financial statements for a summary of these revenue recognition policies.  we record reductions to home entertainment and
software product revenues for estimated future returns of merchandise and for customer programs and sales incentives. these estimates are based upon historical return experience, current economic trends, and projections of customer demand for and
acceptance of our products. if we underestimate the level of returns and concessions in a particular period, we may record less revenue in later periods when returns exceed the estimated amount. conversely, if we overestimate the level of returns
and concessions for a period, we may have additional revenue in later periods when returns and concessions are less than estimated.  revenues from advance theme park ticket sales are recognized when the tickets are used. for non-expiring, multi-day tickets, we recognize revenue over a three-year time period based on estimated usage patterns, which are derived from
historical usage patterns. a change in these estimated usage patterns could have an impact on the timing of revenue recognition.  pension and
postretirement benefit plan actuarial assumptions  the companys pension and postretirement medical benefit obligations and related
costs are calculated using actuarial concepts, within the framework of statement of financial accounting standards no.87 employers accounting for pensions and statement of financial accounting standards no.106,
employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions, respectively. two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and/or liability measurement. we
evaluate these critical assumptions annually. other assumptions include the healthcare cost trend rate and employee demographic factors such as retirement patterns, mortality, turnover, and rate of compensation increase.  the discount rate enables us to state expected future cash payments for benefits as a present value on the measurement date. the guideline for setting
this rate is a high-quality long-term corporate bond rate. a lower
-52-
table of contents
discount rate increases the present value of benefit obligations and increases pension expense. we increased our discount rate to 6.40% in 2006 from 5.25% in
2005 to reflect market interest rate conditions at our june30, 2006 measurement date. the assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. the companys discount rate
was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds. the resulting discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves. a one percentage
point decrease in the assumed discount rate would increase total net periodic pension and postretirement medical expense for fiscal 2007 by $119 million and would increase the projected benefit obligation at october1, 2006 by
$947million, respectively. a one percentage point increase in the assumed discount rate would decrease these amounts by $88 million and $780 million, respectively.  to determine the expected long-term rate of return on the plan assets, we consider the current and expected asset allocation, as well as historical and expected returns on each plan asset class. a lower expected rate
of return on pension plan assets will increase pension expense. our long-term expected return on plan assets was 7.50% in both 2006 and 2005, respectively. a one percentage point change in the long-term return on pension plan asset assumption would
impact fiscal 2007 annual pension and postretirement medical expense by approximately $43 million. see note 9 to the consolidated financial statements.  in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no.158, employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, an amendment of fasb statements no.87, 88, 106, and 132(r)
(sfas 158). see note 2 to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion.  goodwill, intangible assets, long-lived assets and investments
statement of financial accounting standards no.142, goodwill and other intangible assets (sfas 142) requires that goodwill and
other indefinite-lived intangible assets be tested for impairment on an annual basis. in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, market values and projections regarding estimated future cash flows and
other factors are used to determine the fair value of the respective assets. if these estimates or related projections change in the future, we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets.  as required by sfas 142, goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally one reporting level below the operating segment. sfas 142
requires the company to compare the fair value of each reporting unit to its carrying amount on an annual basis to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment. if the fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an
impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its goodwill.  to determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flow) corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate. the factor most sensitive to
change with respect to our discounted cash flow analyses is the estimated future cash flows of each reporting unit which is, in turn, sensitive to our estimates of future revenue growth and margins for these businesses. if actual revenue growth
and/or margins are lower than our expectations, the impairment test results could differ. a present value technique was not used to determine the fair value of the television network, a business within the television broadcasting reporting unit
within the media networks operating segment. to determine the fair value of the television network, we used a revenue multiple, as a present value technique would not capture the full fair value of the television network and there is little
comparable market data available due to the scarcity of television networks. if there were a publicly disclosed sale of a comparable network, this may provide better market information with which to estimate the value of the television network and
could impact our impairment assessment. we applied what we believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of the reporting units. if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies, the
impairment test results could differ.  sfas 142 requires the company to compare the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to
its carrying amount. if the carrying amount of an indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. fair values for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted
cash flows, market multiples, or appraised values as appropriate.

table of contents
the company has cost and equity investments. the fair value of these investments is dependent on the
performance of the investee companies, as well as volatility inherent in the external markets for these investments. in assessing potential impairment for these investments, we consider these factors as well as forecasted financial performance of
our investees. if these forecasts are not met, impairment charges may be required.  we completed our impairment testing as of
september30, 2006, which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $32 million related to certain fcc licenses, primarily associated with espn radio stations, reflecting an overall market decline in certain radio markets in which we operate.
contingencies and litigation  we are
currently involved in certain legal proceedings and, as required, have accrued estimates of the probable and estimable losses for the resolution of these claims. these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside counsel and are based
upon an analysis of potential results, assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies. it is possible, however, that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by changes
in our assumptions or the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings. see note14 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on litigation exposure.  income tax audits  as a matter of course, the company
is regularly audited by federal, state, and foreign tax authorities. from time to time, these audits result in proposed assessments. the internal revenue service has commenced its examination of the companys federal income tax returns for 2001
through 2004. during fiscal 2006, the company settled certain state income tax disputes and released $40million in related tax reserves that were no longer required. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company reached settlements
with the internal revenue service regarding all assessments proposed with respect to its federal income tax returns for 1996 through 2000, and a settlement with the california franchise tax board regarding assessments proposed with respect to its
state tax returns for 1994 through 2003. these favorable settlements resulted in the company releasing $102 million in tax reserves which were no longer required with respect to the settled matters. during the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the
favorable resolution of a tax matter resulted in the release of $24 million in tax reserves. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the company reached a settlement with the internal revenue service regarding all assessments proposed with respect
to its federal income tax returns for 1993 through 1995. the favorable settlement resulted in the company releasing $120 million in tax reserves that were no longer required with respect to the settled matters.  stock option compensation expense  each year during
the second quarter, the company awards stock options and restricted stock units to a broad-based group of management and creative personnel (the annual grant). prior to the fiscal 2006 annual grant, the fair value of options granted was estimated on
the grant date using the black-scholes option pricing model. beginning with the fiscal 2006 annual grant, the company has changed to the binomial valuation model. the binomial valuation model considers certain characteristics of fair value option
pricing that are not considered under the black-scholes model. similar to the black-scholes model, the binomial valuation model takes into account variables such as volatility, dividend yield, and the risk-free interest rate. however, the binomial
valuation model also considers the expected exercise multiple (the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average) and the termination rate (the probability of a vested option being cancelled due to the
termination of the option holder) in computing the value of the option. accordingly, the company believes that the binomial valuation model should produce a fair value that is more representative of the value of an employee option.

commencing with the 2006 annual grant, the company utilized the binomial valuation model.
(2)
the company utilized the black-scholes model during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004.  although the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date, changes in thecompanys assumptions may change the
value and therefore, the expense related to future stock option grants. the assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value in the binomial valuation model are the assumed volatility and expected exercise multiple. increases or decreases
in either the assumed volatility or expected exercise multiple will cause the binomial option value to increase or decrease, respectively.  the volatility assumption for fiscal 2006 and 2005 considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the companys performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions. volatility for fiscal 2004 was
estimated based upon historical share-price volatility. see note 11 to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information. if the assumed volatility of 26% used by the company during 2006 was increased or decreased by 5 percentage
points (i.e. to 31% or to 21%), the weighted average binomial value of our 2006 stock option grants would have increased by 8% or decreased by 10%, respectively.  the expected exercise multiple may be influenced by the companys future stock performance, stock price volatility, and employee turnover rates. if the exercise multiple assumption of 1.48 used by the company
during 2006 were increased to 1.7 or decreased to 1.3, the weighted average binomial value of our 2006 stock option grants would have increased by 4% or decreased by 9%, respectively.  in connection with the acquisition of pixar on may5, 2006, the company converted previously issued vested and unvested pixar stock-based awards
into disney stock-based awards consisting of 44million stock options and one million rsus. the fair value of these awards was estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model, as the information required to use the binomial valuation
model was not reasonably available. the methodology utilized to determine the assumptions in the black-scholes model was consistent with that used by the company for its option pricing models.  accounting changes  sab 108  in september 2006, the sec staff issued staff accounting bulletin no.108, considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying
misstatements in current year financial statements (sab 108). sab 108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity in practice surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements. sab 108 requires that registrants
quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstated amount that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. sab 108 must be
implemented by the end of the companys fiscal 2007. the company is currently assessing the potential effect of sab 108 on its financial statements.  sfas 158  in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no.158, employers accounting for defined benefit pension
and other postretirement plans, an amendment of fasb statements no.87, 88, 106, and 132(r) (sfas 158). this statement requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other
-55-
table of contents
postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and changes in that funded status to be recognized in comprehensive
income in the year in which the changes occur. sfas 158 also requires measurement of the funded status of a plan as of the date of the statement of financial position. the recognition provisions of sfas 158 are effective for fiscal 2007, while the
measurement date provisions are effective for fiscal year 2009. if sfas 158 was applied at the end of fiscal 2006, using the companys june30, 2006 actuarial valuation, we would have recorded a pre-tax charge to accumulated other
comprehensive income totaling $509 million ($320 million after tax) representing the difference between the funded status of the plans based on the project benefit obligation and the amounts recorded on our balance sheet at september30, 2006.
sfas 157  in september 2006, the
fasbissued statement of financial accounting standards no.157, fair value measurements (sfas157). sfas 157 provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of fair value in
generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable. sfas 157 also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the methods and assumptions
used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measures on earnings. sfas157 is effective for the companys 2009 fiscal year, although early adoption is permitted. the company is currently assessing the potential effect of sfas
157 on its financial statements.  fin 48  in july 2006, the fasb issued fasb interpretation no.48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes (fin 48). fin 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability threshold that a tax position
must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. the minimum threshold is defined in fin 48 as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing authority, including resolution of any
related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of being realized upon ultimate
settlement. fin 48 must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption. the cumulative effect of applying fin 48 at adoption, if any, is to be reported as an adjustment to opening retained earnings for the year of adoption. fin 48 is
effective for the companys 2008 fiscal year, although early adoption is permitted. the company is currently assessing the potential effect of fin 48 on its financial statements.  sfas 123r  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company adopted statement of financial
accounting standards no.123r, share-based payment (sfas 123r), which revises sfas 123, accounting for stock-based compensation, and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no.25, accounting for stock issued to
employees (apb 25). sfas 123r requires that new, modified, and unvested share-based payment transactions with employees, such as stock options and restricted stock, be recognized in the financial statements based on their fair value and
recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. the company adopted sfas 123r, effective october1, 2004, using the modified retrospective method. this method required the restatement of interim financial statements in the year of
adoption based on the amounts previously calculated and reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures required by sfas 123. however, fiscal years prior to 2005 have not been restated.  the impact of the adoption of sfas 123(r) is as follows:

stock option compensation expense is net of capitalized stock option compensation and includes amortization of previously capitalized stock option compensation
costs. capitalized stock option compensation totaled $52 million and $18 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively.

prior to fiscal 2005, employee stock options were accounted for under the intrinsic value method in
accordance with apb 25 and its related interpretations, and were generally granted at market value. accordingly, compensation expense for stock option awards was generally not recognized in the consolidated statements of income. the following table
reflects pro forma net income and earnings per share for the year ended september30, 2004, had the company elected to adopt the fair value approach of sfas 123 as reported in the footnotes to the companys financial statement for that
year. the pro forma amounts may not be representative of future disclosures since the estimated fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the vesting period and additional options may be granted or options may be cancelled in future
years.

eitf d-108  in september
2004, the emerging issues task force (eitf) issued topic no. d-108, use of the residual method to value acquired assets other than goodwill (eitf d-108). eitf d-108 requires that a direct value method be used to value intangible assets
acquired in business combinations completed after september29, 2004. eitf d-108 also requires the company to perform an impairment test using a direct value method on all intangible assets that were previously valued using the residual method.
any impairments arising from the initial application of a direct value method are reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change. for radio station acquisitions subsequent to the acquisition of capital cities/abc, inc. in 1996, the company
applied the residual value method to value the acquired fcc licenses. we adopted eitf d-108 for the fiscal year ended october1, 2005 and recorded a non-cash, $57 million pre-tax charge ($36 million after-tax) as a cumulative effect of
accounting change.

fin 46r  in january 2003, the fasb issued interpretation no.46r, consolidation of variable interest entities (fin 46r). variable interest entities (vies) are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities
without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability. all vies with which the company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the
vie. the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the vie for financial reporting purposes.  in connection with the adoption of fin
46r, the company concluded that euro disney and hong kong disneyland are vies and that we are the primary beneficiary. as a result, the company began consolidating euro disney and hong kong disneylands balance sheets on march31, 2004,
the end of the companys second quarter of fiscal 2004, and the income and cash flow statements beginning april1, 2004, the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2004. under fin 46r transition rules, the operating results of euro
disney and hong kong disneyland continued to be accounted for on the equity method for the six months ended march31, 2004. see note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.  we have concluded that the rest of our equity investments do not require consolidation as either they are not vies, or in the event that they are vies,
we are not the primary beneficiary. the company also has variable interests in certain other vies that have not been consolidated because the company is not the primary beneficiary. these vies do not involve any material exposure to the company.
forward-looking statements  the
private securities litigation reform act of 1995 provides a safe harbor for forward-looking statements made by or on behalf of the company. we may from time to time make written or oral statements that are forward-looking, including
statements contained in this report and other filings with the securities and exchange commission and in reports to our shareholders. such statements may, for example, express expectations or projections about future actions that we may take,
including restructuring or strategic initiatives, or about developments beyond our control including changes in domestic or global economic conditions. these statements are made on the basis of managements views and assumptions as of the time
the statements are made and we undertake no obligation to update these statements. there can be no assurance, however, that our expectations will necessarily come to pass. significant factors affecting these expectations are set forth under
item1a  risk factors of this report on form 10-k.
item7a.
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk  the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes, foreign currency fluctuations, and changes in the market values of its investments.  policies and procedures  in the normal course of business, we employ established policies and procedures to manage the
companys exposure to changes in interest rates, foreign currencies, and the fair market value of certain investments in debt and equity securities using a variety of financial instruments.  our objectives in managing exposure to interest rate changes are to limit the impact of interest rate volatility on earnings and cash flows and to lower
overall borrowing costs. to achieve these objectives, we primarily use interest rate swaps to manage net exposure to interest rate changes related to the companys portfolio of borrowings. by policy, the company maintains fixed-rate debt as a
percentage of its net debt between minimum and maximum percentages.  our objective in managing exposure to foreign currency fluctuations is
to reduce volatility of earnings and cash flow in order to allow management to focus on core business issues and challenges. accordingly, the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the
u.s. dollar equivalent value of its existing foreign currency assets, liabilities, commitments, and forecasted foreign currency
-58-
table of contents
revenues. the company utilizes option strategies and forward contracts that provide for the sale of foreign currencies to hedge probable, but not firmly
committed, transactions. the company also uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets and liabilities. the principal foreign currencies hedged are the euro, british pound, japanese yen, and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used
to effectively convert foreign currency denominated borrowings to u.s. dollar denominated borrowings. by policy, the company maintains hedge coverage between minimum and maximum percentages of its forecasted foreign exchange exposures generally for
periods not to exceed five years. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures.  it is the companys policy to enter into foreign currency and interest rate derivative transactions and other financial instruments only to the extent considered necessary to meet its objectives as stated above.
the company does not enter into these transactions or any other hedging transactions for speculative purposes.  value at risk (var)  the company utilizes a var model to estimate the maximum potential one-day loss in the fair value of its interest rate, foreign exchange, and market
sensitive equity financial instruments. the var model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a 95% confidence level. various modeling techniques can be used in a var computation. the companys computations are based on the
interrelationships between movements in various interest rates, currencies, and equity prices (a variance/co-variance technique). these interrelationships were determined by observing interest rate, foreign currency, and equity market changes over
the preceding quarter for the calculation of var amounts at fiscal 2006 year end. the model includes all of the companys debt as well as all interest rate and foreign exchange derivative contracts and market sensitive equity investments.
forecasted transactions, firm commitments, and receivables and accounts payable denominated in foreign currencies, which certain of these instruments are intended to hedge, were excluded from the model.  the var model is a risk analysis tool and does not purport to represent actual losses in fair value that will be incurred by the company, nor does it
consider the potential effect of favorable changes in market factors.  var on a combined basis was $21 million at september30, 2006
and october1, 2005.  the estimated maximum potential one-day loss in fair value, calculated using the var model, is as follows

the var for euro disney and hong kong disneyland is immaterial as of september30, 2006. in
calculating the var it was determined that credit risks are the primary driver for changes in the value of euro disneys debt rather than interest rate risks. accordingly, we have excluded euro disneys borrowings from the above var
calculation.

item9a. controls and procedures  evaluation of disclosure controls and procedures  we have
established disclosure controls and procedures to ensure that material information relating to the company, including its consolidated subsidiaries, is made known to the officers who certify the companys financial reports and to other members
of senior management and the board of directors.  based on their evaluation as of september30, 2006, the principal executive officer
and principal financial officer of the company have concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in rules 13a-15(e) and 15d-15(e) under the securities exchange act of 1934) are effective to ensure that the
information required to be disclosed by the company in the reports that it files or submits under the securities exchange act of 1934 is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in sec rules and forms.
managements report on internal control over financial reporting  managements report set forth on page 69 is
incorporated herein by reference.  changes in internal controls  there have been no significant changes in our internal
control over financial reporting or in factors affecting internal control over financial reporting during the fiscal year ended september30, 2006, that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal
control over financial reporting.

other information  on february 6, 2006, the
company announced that it had agreed to separate the assets of its abc radio businesses (except for the espn radio and radio disney networks and station businesses) (the spinco business) and merge the spinco business with citadel broadcasting
corporation (citadel), pursuant to, among other agreements, a separation agreement (the separation agreement) between the company and its wholly owned subsidiary abc radio holdings, inc. (spinco) and an agreement and plan of merger (the merger
agreement) between the company, spinco, citadel and one of citadels subsidiaries. in connection with the merger, the company was to retain between $1.40 billion and $1.65 billion of cash proceeds of debt financing to be incurred by spinco
prior to the merger, with the amount depending on the market price of citadels common stock over a measurement period ending prior to the closing of the merger, and shareholders of the company were to hold approximately 52% of the common stock
of citadel outstanding after the merger. on november 19, 2006, the parties amended the separation agreement and the merger agreement to reduce the amount of the debt financing (and the proceeds to be retained by the company) to be between $1.10
billion and $1.35 billion and increased the percentage of citadel common stock disneys stockholders are expected to collectively hold to approximately 57% of citadels common stock. the amendments also extend the period during which the
transaction is required to close until june 15, 2007 and provide that the closing date will not be earlier than may 31, 2007. the amendments to the separation agreement and the merger agreement are filed as exhibits 2.3 and 2.5 to this report and
are incorporated herein by reference.

report of independent registered public accounting firm  to the board of directors and shareholders of the walt disney company
we have completed integrated audits of the walt disney companys consolidated financial statements and of its internal control over financial
reporting as of september30, 2006, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.  consolidated financial statements  in our opinion, the accompanying consolidated balance sheets and the related consolidated statements of income, shareholders equity and cash flows present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of the walt disney
company and its subsidiaries (the company) at september30, 2006 and october1, 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended september30, 2006 in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. these financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our
audits. we conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting
principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinion.  as discussed in note 2 to the consolidated financial statements, during the year ended october1, 2005, the company changed the manner in which it values its fcc
licenses and the manner in which it accounts for stock compensation costs. also, during the year ended september30, 2004, the company changed the manner in which it evaluates whether variable interest entities should be consolidated and,
accordingly, began consolidating euro disney and hong kong disneyland as of march31, 2004.  internal control over
financial reporting  also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in the managements report on internal control over financial
reporting appearing under this item15, that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of september30, 2006 based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by
the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso), is fairly stated, in all material respects, based on those criteria. furthermore, in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of september30, 2006, based on criteria established in internal control  integrated framework issued by the coso. the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express opinions on managements assessment and on the effectiveness of the companys
internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards
require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. an audit of internal control over financial reporting includes
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such other procedures as we consider
necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.  a companys internal control over financial
reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a

represents 100% of euro disney and hong kong disneylands capital expenditures and depreciation expense for all periods beginning april1, 2004. hong kong
disneylands capital expenditures totaled $95 million, $591 million, and $251 million for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 respectively. the decrease in capital expenditures in fiscal 2006 was primarily due to lower investment at hong kong
disneyland resulting from the substantial completion of the park prior to its opening in september 2005, whereas fiscal 2004 included only six months of activity. our equity partner contributed $47 million, $147 million, and $66 million, which are
included as sources of cash in financing activities, in fiscal 2006, 2005, and the second half of fiscal 2004, respectively.

summary of significant accounting policies  principles
of consolidation  the consolidated financial statements of the company include the accounts of the walt disney company and its
subsidiaries after elimination of intercompany accounts and transactions. in december 1999, dvd financing, inc. (dfi), a subsidiary of disney vacation development, inc. and an indirect subsidiary of the company, completed a receivable sale
transaction that established a facility that permits dfi to sell receivables arising from the sale of vacation club memberships on a periodic basis. in connection with this facility, dfi prepares separate financial statements, although its separate
assets and liabilities are also consolidated in these financial statements.  accounting changes  sab 108  in september 2006, the sec staff issued
staff accounting bulletin no.108, considering the effects of prior year misstatements when quantifying misstatements in current year financial statements (sab108). sab 108 was issued in order to eliminate the diversity in practice
surrounding how public companies quantify financial statement misstatements. sab 108 requires that registrants quantify errors using both a balance sheet and income statement approach and evaluate whether either approach results in a misstated
amount that, when all relevant quantitative and qualitative factors are considered, is material. sab 108 must be implemented by the end of the companys fiscal 2007. the company is currently assessing the potential effect of sab 108 on its
financial statements.

sfas 158  in september 2006, the fasb issued sfas no.158, employers accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, an amendment of fasb statements no.87, 88, 106, and 132(r) (sfas 158). this statement
requires recognition of the overfunded or underfunded status of defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as an asset or liability in the statement of financial position and changes in that funded status to be recognized in
comprehensive income in the year in which the changes occur. sfas 158 also requires measurement of the funded status of a plan as of the date of the statement of financial position. the recognition provisions of sfas 158 are effective for fiscal
2007, while the measurement date provisions are effective for fiscal year 2009. if sfas 158 was applied at the end of fiscal 2006, using the companys june30, 2006 actuarial valuation, we would have recorded a pre-tax charge to
accumulated other comprehensive income totaling $509 million ($320 million after tax) representing the difference between the funded status of the plans based on the project benefit obligation and the amounts recorded on our balance sheet at
september30, 2006.  sfas 157  in
september 2006, the fasbissued statement of financial accounting standards no.157, fair value measurements (sfas157). sfas 157 provides a common definition of fair value and establishes a framework to make the measurement of
fair value in generally accepted accounting principles more consistent and comparable. sfas 157 also requires expanded disclosures to provide information about the extent to which fair value is used to measure assets and liabilities, the methods and
assumptions used to measure fair value, and the effect of fair value measures on earnings. sfas157 is effective for the companys 2009 fiscal year, although early adoption is permitted. the company is currently assessing the potential
effect of sfas 157 on its financial statements.  fin 48  in july 2006, the fasb issued fasb interpretation no.48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes (fin48). fin 48 clarifies the accounting for income taxes by prescribing a minimum probability
threshold that a tax position must meet before a financial statement benefit is recognized. the minimum threshold is defined in fin48 as a tax position that is more likely than not to be sustained upon examination by the applicable taxing
authority, including resolution of any related appeals or litigation processes, based on the technical merits of the position. the tax benefit to be recognized is measured as the largest amount of benefit that is greater than fifty percent likely of
being realized upon ultimate settlement. fin 48 must be applied to all existing tax positions upon initial adoption. the cumulative effect of applying fin 48 at adoption, if any, is to be reported as an adjustment to opening retained earnings for
the year of adoption. fin 48 is effective for the companys 2008 fiscal year, although early adoption is permitted. the company is currently assessing the potential effect of fin 48 on its financial statements.  sfas 123r  in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the
company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no.123r, share-based payment (sfas 123r), which revises sfas 123, accounting for stock-based compensation and supersedes accounting principles board opinion no.25,
accounting for stock issued to employees (apb 25). sfas 123r requires that new, modified and unvested share-based payment transactions with employees, such as stock options and restricted stock, be recognized in the financial statements based
on their fair value and recognized as compensation expense over the vesting period. the company adopted sfas 123r effective october1, 2004, using the modified retrospective method. this method required the restatement of interim financial
statements in the year of adoption based on the amounts previously calculated and reported in the pro forma footnote disclosures required by sfas 123. however, fiscal years prior to 2005 have not been restated.

stock option compensation expense is net of capitalized stock option compensation and includes amortization of previously capitalized stock option compensation
costs. capitalized stock option compensation totaled $52 million and $18 million in 2006 and 2005, respectively.  prior to
fiscal 2005, employee stock options were accounted for under the intrinsic value method in accordance with apb 25 and its related interpretations, and were generally granted at market value. accordingly, compensation expense for stock option awards
was generally not recognized in the consolidated statements of income. the following table reflects pro forma net income and earnings per share for the year ended september30, 2004, had the company elected to adopt the fair value approach of
sfas 123 as reported in the footnotes to the companys financial statements for that year. the pro forma amounts may not be representative of future disclosures since the estimated fair value of stock options is amortized to expense over the
vesting period and additional options may be granted or options may be cancelled in future years.

effects of share-based payment awards. the company has elected to adopt the alternative
-82-
table of contents
transition method provided in the fasb staff position for calculating the tax effects of stock-based compensation pursuant to sfas 123(r). the alternative
transition method includes computational guidance to establish the beginning balance of the additional paid-in capital pool (apic pool) related to the tax effects of employee stock-based compensation, and a simplified method to determine the
subsequent impact on the apic pool for employee stock-based compensation awards that are vested and outstanding upon adoption of sfas 123(r).  eitf
d-108  in september 2004, the emerging issues task force (eitf) issued topic no. d-108, use of the residual method to value acquired
assets other than goodwill (eitf d-108). eitf d-108 requires that a direct value method be used to value intangible assets acquired in business combinations completed after september29, 2004. eitf d-108 also requires the company to perform
an impairment test using a direct value method on all intangible assets that were previously valued using the residual method. any impairments arising from the initial application of a direct value method are reported as a cumulative effect of
accounting change. for radio station acquisitions subsequent to the acquisition of capital cities/abc, inc. in 1996, the company applied the residual value method to value the acquired fcc licenses. we adopted eitf d-108 for the fiscal year ended
october1, 2005 and recorded a non-cash, $57 million pre-tax charge ($36 million after-tax) as a cumulative effect of accounting change.  fin 46r
in january 2003, the fasb issued interpretation no.46r, consolidation of variable interest entities (fin 46r). variable
interest entities (vies) are generally entities that lack sufficient equity to finance their activities without additional financial support from other parties or whose equity holders lack adequate decision making ability. all vies with which the
company is involved must be evaluated to determine the primary beneficiary of the risks and rewards of the vie. the primary beneficiary is required to consolidate the vie for financial reporting purposes.  in connection with the adoption of fin 46r, the company concluded that euro disney and hong kong disneyland are vies and that we are the primary
beneficiary. as a result, the company began consolidating euro disney and hong kong disneylands balance sheets on march31, 2004, the end of the companys second quarter of fiscal 2004, and the income and cash flow statements
beginning april1, 2004, the beginning of the third quarter of fiscal 2004. under fin 46r transition rules, the operating results of euro disney and hong kong disneyland continued to be accounted for on the equity method for the six months
ended march31, 2004 (see note 5).  we have concluded that the rest of our equity investments do not require consolidation as either
they are not vies, or in the event that they are vies, we are not the primary beneficiary. the company also has variable interests in certain other vies that have not been consolidated because the company is not the primary beneficiary. these vies
do not involve any material exposure to the company.  reclassifications  certain reclassifications have been made in the fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004 financial statements and notes to conform to the fiscal 2006 presentation.
use of estimates  the preparation of
financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and footnotes thereto. actual results may differ from
those estimates.  revenue recognition  broadcast advertising revenues are recognized when commercials are aired. revenues from television subscription services related to the companys primary cable programming services are recognized as services are provided. certain of
the companys contracts with cable service providers include annual programming commitments. in these cases, revenue subject to the commitment, that is generally collected ratably over the year is deferred until the annual commitments are
satisfied, which generally results in higher revenue recognition in the second half of the year.  revenues from advance theme park ticket
sales are recognized when the tickets are used. for non-expiring, multi-day tickets, we recognize revenue over a three-year time period based on estimated usage patterns that are
-83-
table of contents
derived from historical usage patterns. revenues from corporate sponsors at the theme parks are generally recognized over the period of the applicable
agreements commencing with the opening of the related attraction.  revenues from the theatrical distribution of motion pictures are
recognized when motion pictures are exhibited. revenues from video and video game sales, net of anticipated returns and customer incentives, are recognized on the date that video units are made available for sale by retailers. revenues from the
licensing of feature films and television programming are recorded when the material is available for telecasting by the licensee and when certain other conditions are met.  merchandise licensing advances and guarantee royalty payments are recognized based on the contractual royalty rate when the licensed product is sold by
the licensee. non-refundable advances and minimum guarantee royalty payments in excess of royalties earned are generally recognized as revenue at the end of the contract term.  advertising expense  advertising costs are expensed as incurred. advertising expense incurred for
fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004 totaled $2.5 billion, $2.9 billion, and $3.0 billion, respectively.  cash and cash equivalents  cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand and marketable securities with original maturities of three months or less.  investments  debt securities that the company has the
positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified as held-to-maturity and reported at amortized cost. debt securities not classified as held-to-maturity and marketable equity securities are classified as either
trading or available-for-sale, and are recorded at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in earnings or shareholders equity, respectively. all other equity securities are accounted for using either the
cost method or the equity method.  the company regularly reviews its investments to determine whether a decline in fair value below the
cost basis is other than temporary. if the decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary, the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value and the amount of the write-down is included in the consolidated statements of
income.  translation policy  the u.s.
dollar is the functional currency for the majority of our international operations. the local currency is the functional currency for euro disney, hong kong disneyland, and international locations of the disney stores.  for u.s. dollar functional currency locations, foreign currency assets and liabilities are remeasured into u.s. dollars at end-of-period exchange rates,
except for nonmonetary balance sheet accounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. revenue and expenses are remeasured at average exchange rates in effect during each period, except for those expenses related to the previously noted
balance sheet amounts, which are remeasured at historical exchange rates. gains or losses from foreign currency remeasurement are included in net earnings.  for local currency functional locations, assets and liabilities are translated at end-of-period rates while revenues and expenses are translated at average rates in effect during the period. equity is translated at
historical rates and the resulting cumulative translation adjustments are included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (aoci).  inventories  carrying amounts of merchandise, materials, and supplies inventories are generally determined on a moving
average cost basis and are stated at the lower of cost or market.  film and television costs  film and television costs include capitalizable direct negative costs, production overhead, interest, development costs, and acquired production costs and
are stated at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or fair value.
-84-
table of contents
acquired programming costs for the companys television and cable/satellite networks are stated at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortization, or
net realizable value. acquired television broadcast program licenses and rights are recorded when the license period begins and the program is available for use. marketing, distribution, and general and administrative costs are expensed as incurred.
film and television production and participation costs are expensed based on the ratio of the current periods gross revenues to
estimated remaining total gross revenues (projected revenue method) from all sources on an individual production basis. estimated remaining gross revenue for film productions includes revenue that will be earned within ten years of the date of the
initial theatrical release. for acquired film libraries, remaining revenues include amounts to be earned for up to twenty years from the date of acquisition. development costs for projects that have been abandoned or have not been set for production
within three years are generally written off.  television network series costs and multi-year sports rights are amortized under the
projected revenue method based on revenues from such programs or on a straight-line basis, as appropriate. for television network series, we include revenues that will be earned within ten years of the delivery of the first episode, or if still in
production, five years from the date of delivery of the most recent episode, if later. for determining multi-year sports rights costs, gross revenues include both advertising revenues and an allocation of affiliate fees. if the annual contractual
payments over the term of a multi-year sports programming arrangement approximate the rights cost based on the projected revenue method, we expense the annual payments during the season. television network and station rights for theatrical movies
and other long-form programming are charged to expense primarily on an accelerated basis related to the projected usage of the programs.  estimates of total gross revenues can change significantly due to a variety of factors, including advertising rates and the level of market acceptance of the production. accordingly, revenue estimates are reviewed periodically and
amortization is adjusted, if necessary. such adjustments could have a material effect on results of operations in future periods. the net realizable value of network television broadcast program licenses and rights is reviewed using a daypart
methodology. a daypart is defined as an aggregation of programs broadcast during a particular time of day or programs of a similar type. the companys dayparts are early morning, daytime, late night, primetime, news, children, and sports
(includes network and cable). the net realizable values of other cable programming are reviewed on an aggregated basis for each cable channel.  internal-use software costs  the company expenses costs incurred in the preliminary project stage of developing or acquiring
internal use software, such as research and feasibility studies, as well as costs incurred in the post-implementation/operational stage, such as maintenance and training. capitalization of software development costs occurs only after the
preliminary-project stage is complete, management authorizes the project, and it is probable that the project will be completed and the software will be used for the function intended. as of september30, 2006 and october1, 2005,
capitalized software costs totaled $491 million and $483 million, respectively. the capitalized costs are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the software, ranging from 3-10 years.  software product development costs  software product
development costs incurred prior to reaching technological feasibility are expensed. we have determined that technological feasibility of the software is not established until substantially all product development is complete. the software product
development costs that have been capitalized to date have been insignificant.  parks, resorts and other property  parks, resorts, and other property are carried at historical cost. depreciation is computed on the straight-line method over estimated useful lives as
follows:
attractions
25  40 years
buildings and improvements
40 years
leasehold improvements
life of lease or asset life if less
land improvements
20  40 years
furniture, fixtures and equipment

goodwill and other intangible assets  the company performs an annual impairment test at fiscal year end for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets, including fcc licenses and trademarks. as required by statement of financial accounting
standards no.142, goodwill and other intangible assets (sfas 142), goodwill is allocated to various reporting units, which are generally one level below our operating segments.  to determine if there is potential goodwill impairment, sfas 142 requires the company to compare the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying
amount on an annual basis. if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value, an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than the carrying value of its
goodwill.  to determine the fair value of our reporting units, we generally use a present value technique (discounted cash flow)
corroborated by market multiples when available and as appropriate, except for the abc television network, a business within the media networks operating segment, for which we used a revenue multiple. we did not use a present value technique or a
market multiple approach to value the abc television network as a present value technique would not capture its full fair value and there is little comparable market data available due to the scarcity of television networks. we applied what we
believe to be the most appropriate valuation methodology for each of our reporting units. if we had established different reporting units or utilized different valuation methodologies, the impairment test results could differ.  sfas 142 requires the company to compare the fair value of an indefinite-lived intangible asset to its carrying amount. if the carrying amount of an
indefinite-lived intangible asset exceeds its fair value, an impairment loss is recognized. fair values for goodwill and other indefinite-lived intangible assets are determined based on discounted cash flows, market multiples, or appraised values,
as appropriate.  we completed our impairment testing as of september30, 2006, which resulted in a non-cash impairment charge of $32
million related to certain fcc licenses, primarily associated with espn radio stations, reflecting an overall market decline in certain radio markets in which we operate.  amortizable intangible assets, principally copyrights, are amortized on a straight-line basis over periods ranging from 10  31 years.  risk management contracts  in the normal course of business, the company employs a variety of
financial instruments to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, and investments in equity and debt securities, including interest rate and cross-currency swap agreements; forward, option and
swaption contracts and interest rate caps.  the company formally documents all relationships between hedging instruments and
hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategies for undertaking various hedge transactions. there are two types of derivatives into which the company enters: hedges of fair value exposure and hedges of cash flow exposure.
hedges of fair value exposure are entered into in order to hedge the fair value of a recognized asset, liability, or a firm commitment. hedges of cash flow exposure are entered into in order to hedge a forecasted transaction (e.g. forecasted
revenue) or the variability of cash flows to be paid or received, related to a recognized liability or asset (e.g. floating rate debt).  the company designates and assigns the financial instruments as hedges of forecasted transactions, specific assets, or specific liabilities. when hedged assets or liabilities are sold or extinguished or the forecasted transactions being
hedged are no longer expected to occur, the company recognizes the gain or loss on the designated hedging financial instruments.  option
premiums and unrealized gains on forward contracts and the accrued differential for interest rate and cross-currency swaps to be received under the agreements are recorded on the balance sheet as other assets. unrealized losses on forward contracts
and the accrued differential for interest rate and cross-currency swaps to be
-86-
table of contents
paid under the agreements are included in liabilities. realized gains and losses from hedges are classified in the income statement consistent with the
accounting treatment of the items being hedged. the company accrues the differential for interest rate and cross-currency swaps to be paid or received under the agreements as interest rates and exchange rates change as adjustments to interest
expense over the lives of the swaps. gains and losses on the termination of effective swap agreements, prior to their original maturity, are deferred and amortized to interest expense over the remaining term of the underlying hedged transactions.
from time to time, the company may enter into risk management contracts that are not designated as hedges and do not qualify for hedge
accounting. these contracts are intended to offset certain economic exposures of the company and are carried at market value with any changes in value recorded in earnings. cash flows from hedging activities are classified in the consolidated
statements of cash flows under the same category as the cash flows from the related assets, liabilities or forecasted transactions (see notes 7 and 13).  earnings per share  the company presents both basic and diluted earnings per share (eps) amounts. basic eps is calculated by
dividing net income by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the year. diluted eps is based upon the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding during the year which is calculated using the
treasury-stock method for stock options and assumes conversion of the companys convertible senior notes (see note 7). common equivalent shares are excluded from the computation in periods in which they have an anti-dilutive effect. stock
options for which the exercise price exceeds the average market price over the period are anti-dilutive and, accordingly, are excluded from the calculation.  a reconciliation of net income and the weighted average number of common and common equivalent shares outstanding for calculating diluted earnings per share is as follows:

significant acquisitions and dispositions and restructuring and impairment charges  acquisition of pixar  on may5, 2006 (the closing date), the company completed an all stock
acquisition of pixar, a digital animation studio (the acquisition). disney believes that the creation of high quality feature animation is a key driver of success across many of its businesses and provides content useful across a variety of
traditional and new platforms throughout the world. the acquisition of pixar is intended to support the companys strategic priorities of creating the finest content, embracing leading-edge technologies, and strengthening its global presence.
the results of pixars operations have been included in the companys consolidated financial statements since the closing date.  to purchase pixar, disney exchanged 2.3 shares of its common stock for each share of pixar common stock, resulting in the issuance of 279million shares of disney common stock, and converted previously issued vested and unvested pixar
equity-based awards into approximately 45million disney equity-based awards.
-87-
table of contents
the acquisition purchase price was $7.5 billion ($6.4 billion, net of pixars cash and investments
of approximately $1.1 billion). the value of the stock issued was calculated based on the market value of the companys common stock using the average stock price for the five-day period beginning two days before the acquisition announcement
date on january24, 2006. the fair value of the vested equity-based awards issued at the closing date was estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model, as the information required to use a binomial valuation model was not reasonably
available.  in connection with the acquisition, the company recorded a non-cash, non-taxable gain from the deemed termination of the
existing pixar distribution agreement. under our previously existing distribution agreement with pixar, the company earned a distribution fee that, based on current market rates at the closing date, was favorable to the company. in accordance with
eitf 04-1, accounting for pre-existing relationships between the parties to a business combination (eitf 04-1), the company recognized a $48 million gain, representing the net present value of the favorable portion of the distribution fee
over the remaining life of the distribution agreement. in addition, the company abandoned the pixar sequel projects commenced by the company prior to the acquisition and recorded a pre-tax impairment charge totaling $26 million, which represents the
costs of these projects incurred through the abandonment date. these two items are classified in restructuring and impairment (charges) and other credits, net in the consolidated statement of income.  the company allocated the purchase price to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their fair values,
which were determined primarily through third-party appraisals. the excess of the purchase price over those fair values was recorded as goodwill, which is not amortizable for tax purposes. the fair values set forth below are subject to adjustment if
additional information is obtained prior to the one-year anniversary of the acquisition that would change the fair value allocation as of the acquisition date. the following table summarizes the allocation of the purchase price:

abc radio transaction  on february6, 2006, the company and citadel broadcasting corporation (citadel) announced an agreement to merge the abc radio business, which consists of 22 of the companys owned radio stations and the abc
radio network, with citadel. the espn radio and radio disney networks and station businesses are not included in the transaction. the merger is expected to occur after the abc radio business is distributed to disney shareholders (the distribution).
the agreement was subsequently amended on november 19, 2006. under the amended terms, (i) disneys stockholders are expected to collectively hold approximately 57% of citadels common stock post-merger, and (ii) the company would retain
between $1.10 billion and $1.35 billion in cash, depending upon the market price of citadels common stock over a measurement period ending prior to the closing. this cash will be obtained from loan proceeds raised by abc radio from a third
party lender prior to the distribution. based on citadels stock price on november20, 2006, the company estimates that the aggregate value of the retained cash and citadel common stock to be received by disney shareholders would be
approximately $2.5 billion. the amended agreement provides that the closing will occur no earlier than may 31, 2007, subject to regulatory approvals, and that either party may terminate the agreement if the closing does not occur by june 15, 2007.
other dispositions  the following
disposals occurred during fiscal 2006 and fiscal 2005:

in 2006, the company had no charges for other-than-temporary losses in value of investments. in 2005 and
2004, the company recorded non-cash charges of $42 million and $23 million, respectively, to reflect other-than-temporary losses in value of certain investments.  investment in aircraft leveraged leases  during the fourth quarter of 2005, the company recorded a $101 million pre-tax
charge, or $0.03 per share, to write-off its remaining investment in aircraft leveraged leases with delta air lines, inc. (delta) resulting from deltas bankruptcy filing in september 2005. during the fourth quarter of 2004, the company
recorded a $16 million pre-tax charge to write down its leveraged lease investment in delta consistent with our agreement with delta to reduce lease payments. these charges were reported in net interest expense in the consolidated
statements of income. based on deltas bankruptcy filing, we believe it is unlikely that the company will recover these investments. in the event of a material modification to the delta aircraft leases or foreclosure of the remaining delta
aircraft by the debt holders, certain tax payments of up to $40 million, as of september30, 2006, could be accelerated. the expected tax payments are currently reflected on our balance sheet as a deferred tax liability and are not expected to
result in a further charge to earnings. our remaining aircraft leveraged lease investment of $52 million is with fedex corp.

euro disney financial restructuring  effective october1, 2004, euro disney, the company, and euro disneys lenders finalized a memorandum of agreement (moa) related to the
financial restructuring of euro disney (the 2005 financial restructuring). the moa provided for new financing as well as the restructuring of euro disneys existing financing at that time. the transactions contemplated by the moa were fully
implemented on february23, 2005 with the completion of a 253million equity rights offering. the key provisions of the moa are as follows:  royalties and management fees
royalties and management fees totaling 58million for fiscal 2004 were paid to the company following completion of the rights offering
-92-
table of contents
royalties and management fees for fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2009, totaling 25million per year, payable to the company are to be converted into subordinated long-term
borrowings
royalties and management fees for fiscal 2007 through fiscal 2014, of up to 25million per year, payable to the company will be converted into subordinated long-term
borrowings if operating results do not achieve specified levels  debt covenants
certain covenant violations for fiscal 2003 and fiscal 2004 were waived
euro disney received authorization for up to 240million of capital expenditures for fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2009 for new attractions. approximately
113million has been incurred through the end of fiscal 2006.  existing borrowings
approximately 110million of amounts outstanding on the existing line of credit from the company and 60million of deferred interest payable to caisse des
dpts et consignations (cdc), a french state financial institution, were converted into long-term subordinated borrowings
the interest rate on approximately 450million of euro disneys senior borrowings was increased by approximately 2%
approximately 300million of principal payments on senior borrowings were deferred for three and one-half years
principal payments on certain cdc borrowings were deferred for three and one-half years
euro disneys security deposit requirement was eliminated and the existing deposit balance totaling 100million was paid to senior lenders as a principal payment
interest payments for fiscal 2005 through fiscal 2012, of up to 20million per year, payable to the cdc will be converted to long-term subordinated borrowings if
operating results do not achieve specified levels. interest payments of 20million for fiscal 2005 were converted to borrowings in fiscal 2006. the company expects interest payments of 20million for fiscal 2006 to be converted
into borrowings in fiscal 2007.
interest payments for fiscal 2013 through fiscal 2014, of up to 23million per year, payable to the cdc will be converted to long-term subordinated borrowings if
operating results do not achieve specified levels  new financing
253million equity rights offering, of which the companys share was 100million
new ten-year 150million line of credit from the company for liquidity needs, which reduces to 100million after five years. there were no borrowings under the
new line of credit as of september30, 2006.  any subordinated long-term borrowings due to the company and cdc cannot be
paid until all senior borrowings have been paid. see note 7 for the terms of euro disneys borrowings.  the moa resulted in the
elimination of certain sublease arrangements between the companys then wholly-owned subsidiary, disney s.c.a. and euro disney. these subleases arose in connection with a financial restructuring of euro disney in 1994 whereby disney s.c.a.
(which was then in the form of a s.n.c.) entered into a lease agreement with a financing company with a non-cancelable term of 12 years related to substantially all of the disneyland park assets and then entered into a 12-year sublease agreement
with euro disney on substantially the same payment terms. these lease transactions were eliminated for financial reporting purposes upon consolidation of euro disney by the company as a result of the implementation of fin 46r.

table of contents
the moa additionally provided for the contribution by euro disney of substantially all of its assets and
liabilities (including most of the proceeds of the equity rights offerings referred to above) into disney s.c.a., which became an 82% owned subsidiary of euro disney. other wholly-owned subsidiaries of the company retained the remaining 18%
ownership interest. this enabled euro disney to avoid having to make 292million of payments to disney s.c.a. that would have been due if euro disney exercised the options under certain leases from disney s.c.a. in connection with the
2005 financial restructuring, the company increased its overall effective ownership interest in disneyland resort paris operations from 41% to 51%. pursuant to the moa, the company must maintain at least a direct 39% ownership investment in
euro disney through december31, 2016.  as discussed above, the moa provided for a 2% interest rate increase for certain tranches of
euro disneys debt, resulting in a substantial modification of a portion of this debt. relevant accounting rules required that the substantially modified portion be accounted for as though it had been extinguished and replaced with new
borrowings recorded at fair value, which resulted in a $61 million gain recorded in net interest expense in the consolidated statement of income during the year ended october1, 2005.  certain indirect, wholly-owned subsidiaries of the walt disney company have liability as current or former general partners of disney s.c.a. in addition
to their equity interest in disney s.c.a., certain of these subsidiaries of the company have been capitalized with interest-bearing demand notes with an aggregate face value of 200 million.

2006 exchange rate). the impact of the 2005 financial restructuring on the credit facilities included the deferral of certain principal payments for 3.5 years, with the final maturity of the loans remaining unchanged. in return for these
concessions, the interest rate was increased to euribor plus 3% (5.81% at september 30, 2006) from euribor plus amounts ranging from 0.84% to 1.00% and 96million ($122 million at september30, 2006 exchange rates) of principal was
prepaid on february23, 2005 using debt security deposits (see note 5). the loans mature between fiscal years 2008 and 2013.  euro
disney  other advances. advances of 331million ($421 million at september30, 2006 exchange rates) bear interest at a fixed rate of 3.0%. the remaining advances of 15million ($19 million at september30,
2006 exchange rates) bear interest at euribor plus 3% (5.81% at september30, 2006). the advances are scheduled to mature between fiscal years 2013 and 2017, of which 15million ($19 million at september30, 2006 exchange rate)
are collateralized by certain theme parks assets. the impact of the 2005 financial restructuring on the other advances includes the deferral either directly or indirectly of principal payments for 3.5 years.  euro disney has covenants under its debt agreements that limit its investing and financing activities. beginning with fiscal year 2006, euro disney must
also meet financial performance covenants that necessitate earnings growth. as a result of revenue growth in excess of increases in costs and expenses during fiscal year 2006, management believes that euro disney is in compliance with the covenants
for fiscal 2006. pursuant to the debt agreements, compliance with the covenants is subject to final third-party confirmation.  hong kong
disneyland  senior loans. hong kong disneylands senior loans are borrowings pursuant to a term loan facility of hk$2.3 billion ($293 million at september30, 2006 exchange rates) and a revolving credit facility of hk$1.0 billion
($128 million at september30, 2006 exchange rates). the balance of the senior loans as of september30, 2006 was hk$2.3 billion ($293 million at september30, 2006 exchange rates). the term loan facility has not been drawn down as of
september30, 2006. both facilities are collateralized by bank accounts, fixed assets, and land of the hong kong disneyland theme park with a net book value of approximately hk$13 billion ($1.7 billion at september30, 2006 exchange
rates). both facilities currently carry a rate of three month hibor + 1.25% and are scheduled to mature in fiscal 2016. the spread above hibor is 1.25% through november15, 2010 and 1.375% for the last five years of the facilities. as of
september30, 2006, the rate on the senior loans was 5.81%.  beginning in fiscal year 2006, hong kong disneyland is subject to
semi-annual financial performance covenants under its commercial term loan and revolving credit facility agreement. in july 2006, lenders under the commercial term loan and revolving credit facility agreement provided a waiver to these covenants for
the september 30, 2006 and march 31, 2007 measurement dates. the revolving credit facility will not be available for the period the waiver is in effect unless the covenants are, in fact, satisfied during the period. the covenants will be in effect
for the september 30, 2007 measurement date.

hong kong disneyland  subordinated loans. hong kong disneyland has a subordinated unsecured
loan facility of hk$5.6 billion ($721 million at september30, 2006 exchange rates), which has been fully drawn, that is scheduled to mature on september12, 2030. pursuant to the terms of the loan facility, interest incurred prior to the
september 2005 park opening of hk$433 million ($56 million at september 30, 2006 exchange rates) is not payable until the loan matures and is therefore classified as long-term borrowings. the interest rate on this loan is subject to biannual
revisions under certain conditions, but is capped at an annual rate of 6.75% (until march12, 2014), 7.625% (until march12, 2022) and 8.50% (until september12, 2030). as of september30, 2006 the rate on the subordinated loans
was 3.29%.  total borrowings excluding market value adjustments, have the following scheduled maturities:

in 2006 the company derived tax benefits of $118 million from an exclusion provided under u.s.
income tax laws with respect to certain extraterritorial income attributable to foreign trading gross receipts (ftgrs). this exclusion was repealed as part of the american jobs creation act of 2004 (the act), which was enacted on
october22, 2004. the act provides for a phase-out such that the exclusion for the companys otherwise qualifying ftgrs generated in fiscal 2005, 2006, and 2007 will be limited to approximately 85%, 65%, and 15% of the exclusion,
respectively. no exclusion will be available for transactions originating after the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
-100-
table of contents
the act also provided for a one-time tax deduction of 85% of certain foreign earnings that were
repatriated in fiscal 2005. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company repatriated foreign earnings eligible for this deduction and recorded a tax benefit of $32 million as a result of the reversal of deferred taxes previously provided on
these earnings.  the act made a number of other changes to the income tax laws including the creation of a new deduction relating to
qualifying domestic production activities which will affect the company in the current and future years. the deduction equals three percent of qualifying net income for fiscal 2006 and 2007, six percent for fiscal 2008 through 2010, and nine percent
for fiscal 2011 and thereafter. the u.s. department of the treasury and the irs issued final regulations on may25, 2006 which provide comprehensive rules, definitions, and examples to assist in the implementation of this new deduction. the
company has analyzed the final regulations and anticipates the issuance of further guidance relevant to the calculation of the companys tax benefit. based on existing guidance, our tax provision for fiscal 2006 reflects an estimated benefit of
$25 million.  as a matter of course, the company is regularly audited by federal, state and foreign tax authorities. from time to time,
these audits result in proposed assessments. the internal revenue service has commenced its examination of the companys federal income tax returns for 2001 through 2004. during fiscal 2006, the company settled certain state income tax disputes
and released $40 million in related tax reserves that were no longer required. during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2005, the company reached settlements with the internal revenue service regarding all assessments proposed with respect to its federal
income tax returns for 1996 through 2000, and a settlement with the california franchise tax board regarding assessments proposed with respect to its state tax returns for 1994 through 2003. these favorable settlements resulted in the company
releasing $102 million in tax reserves which were no longer required with respect to the settled matters. during the first quarter of fiscal 2005, the favorable resolution of a tax matter resulted in the release of $24 million in tax reserves.
during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004, the company reached a settlement with the internal revenue service regarding all assessments proposed with respect to its federal income tax returns for 1993 through 1995. the favorable settlement resulted
in the company releasing $120 million in tax reserves that were no longer required with respect to the settled matters.  in fiscal years
2006, 2005 and 2004, income tax benefits attributable to equity based compensation transactions that were allocated to shareholders equity amounted to $106 million, $64 million and $25 million, respectively.  deferred tax assets at october1, 2005 were reduced by a $74 million valuation allowance, of which $24 million was attributable to certain acquired
net operating losses. during fiscal 2006, the company determined that a significant portion of these acquired net operating losses could be utilized with respect to our fiscal 2005 tax returns resulting in a $20 million reduction in current taxes
payable. the realization of this tax benefit resulted in a reduction in the related valuation allowance and a corresponding adjustment being applied as a reduction to goodwill.
pension and other benefit programs  the company maintains pension plans and postretirement medical benefit plans covering most of its domestic employees not covered by union or
industry-wide plans. employees hired after january1, 1994 and abc employees generally hired after january1, 1987 are not eligible for postretirement medical benefits. with respect to its qualified defined benefit pension plans, the
companys policy is to fund, at a minimum, the amount necessary on an actuarial basis to provide for benefits in accordance with the requirements of the employee retirement income security act of 1974. pension benefits are generally based on
years of service and/or compensation. the following chart summarizes the balance sheet impact, as well as the benefit obligations, assets, funded status and rate assumptions associated with the pension and postretirement medical benefit plans based
upon the actuarial valuations prepared as of june30, 2006 and 2005 (the plan measurement dates).

net periodic benefit cost for the current year is based on assumptions determined at the

aggregated $1.6 billion, the accumulated benefit obligations aggregated $1.9 billion, and the projected benefit obligations aggregated

$2.1 billion. as a result, the company has recorded an additional minimum pension liability adjustment of $197 million as of september30, 2006. the
additional minimum pension liability adjustment at october1, 2005 was $1.1 billion. the decrease in the additional minimum pension liability adjustment of $927 million ($585 million after tax) in the current year was primarily due to an
increase in the discount rate from 5.25% at october1, 2005 to 6.40% at september30, 2006. the change in the additional minimum pension liability was recorded as a direct increase in shareholders equity through accumulated other
comprehensive income.  the companys total accumulated pension benefit obligations at september30, 2006 and october1, 2005
were $4.4 billion and $4.6 billion, respectively, of which 96.1% and 97.3%, respectively, were vested.  the accumulated postretirement
medical benefit obligations and fair value of plan assets for postretirement medical plans with accumulated postretirement medical benefit obligations in excess of plan assets were $936 million and $317 million, respectively, at september30,
2006 and $1.2 billion and $260 million, respectively, at october1, 2005.  plan assets  the assets of the companys defined benefit plans are managed on a commingled basis in a third party master trust. the investment policy and
allocation of the assets in the master trust were approved by the companys investment and administrative committee, which has oversight responsibility for the companys retirement plans. the investment policy ranges for the major asset

equity securities include 2.8million shares of company common stock or $84 million (2% of
total plan assets) and $71 million (2% of total plan assets) at september30, 2006 and october1 2005, respectively.  the cash
allocation exceeded the policy range limit on june30, 2006, due to a $314 million employer contribution into the plans in june 2006, which is being invested through december 2006 using the dollar cost averaging method.  plan contributions  during fiscal 2006, the company
contributed $367 million and $33 million to its pension and postretirement medical plans, respectively, which included voluntary contributions above the minimum requirements for the pension plans. based on the january1, 2006 funding valuation,
the company is not required to make any contributions to its pension plans during fiscal 2007. the company may make additional contributions into its pension plans in fiscal 2007 depending on how the funded status of those plans change and as we
gain more clarity with respect to the pension protection act of 2006 (ppa) that was signed into law on august17, 2006. the united states treasury department is in the process of developing implementation guidance for the ppa; however, it is
likely the ppa will accelerate minimum funding requirements beginning in fiscal 2009. the company may choose to pre-fund some of this anticipated funding.

assumptions  certain actuarial assumptions, such as the discount rate, long-term rate of return on plan assets and the healthcare cost trend rate have a significant effect on the amounts reported for net periodic benefit cost as
well as the related benefit obligation amounts.  discount rate  the assumed discount rate for pension plans reflects the
market rates for high-quality corporate bonds currently available. the companys discount rate was determined by considering the average of pension yield curves constructed of a large population of high quality corporate bonds. the resulting
discount rate reflects the matching of plan liability cash flows to the yield curves.  long-term rate of return on plan assets
the long-term rate of return on plan assets represents an estimate of long-term returns on an investment portfolio consisting of a mixture of equities, fixed income, and alternative investments. when determining the long-term rate of return
on plan assets, the company considers long-term rates of return on the asset classes (both historical and forecasted) in which the company expects the pension funds to be invested. the following long-term rates of return by asset class were
considered in setting the long-term rate of return on plan assets assumption:
equity securities
8 %10 %
debt securities
4 %7 %
alternative investments
8 %20 %
healthcare cost trend rate  the company reviews external data and its own historical
trends for healthcare costs to determine the healthcare cost trend rates for the postretirement medical benefit plans. for the 2006 actuarial valuation, we assumed a 9.0% annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered healthcare claims
with the rate decreasing in even increments over five years until reaching 5.0%.  a one percentage point (ppt) change in the key
assumptions would have the following effects on the projected benefit obligations as of october1, 2006 and on cost for fiscal 2007:

multi-employer plans  the company participates in various multi-employer pension plans under union and industry-wide agreements. in 2006, 2005, and 2004, the contributions to
these plans, which are generally expensed as incurred, were $51 million, $37 million, and $38 million, respectively.
-104-
table of contents
defined contribution plans  the company has savings and investment plans that allow eligible employees to allocate up to 20% of their salary through payroll deductions depending on the plan in which the employee participates. the company matches
50% of the employees pre-tax contributions, up to plan limits. in 2006, 2005 and 2004, the costs of these plans were $39 million, $35 million and $33 million, respectively.  medicare modernization act  in may 2004, the fasb issued fasb staff position no.106-2,
accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003 (fsp106-2) in response to a new law regarding prescription drug benefits under medicare as well as a federal
subsidy to sponsors of retiree healthcare benefit plans.  the medicare prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003 was
reflected in accumulated postretirement medical benefit obligations beginning september30, 2004 assuming that the company will continue to provide a prescription drug benefit to retirees that is at least actuarially equivalent to medicare part
d and the company will receive the federal subsidy.  the accumulated postretirement medical benefit obligations at september30, 2004
decreased by approximately $110 million due to the effect of the federal subsidy, and net periodic postretirement medical benefit cost for 2006 and 2005 were reduced by approximately $16 million and $28 million, respectively.
shareholders equity  as of the
filing date of this report, the board of directors had not yet declared a dividend related to fiscal 2006. the company paid a $519 million dividend ($0.27 per share) during the second quarter of fiscal 2006 related to fiscal 2005; paid a $490
million dividend ($0.24 per share) during the second quarter of fiscal 2005 related to fiscal 2004; and paid a $430 million dividend ($0.21 per share) during the second quarter of fiscal 2004 related to fiscal 2003.  during fiscal 2006, the company repurchased 243million shares of disney common stock for approximately $6.9 billion. during fiscal 2005, the
company repurchased 91million shares of disney common stock for approximately $2.4 billion. during fiscal 2004, the company repurchased 15million shares of disney common stock for approximately $335 million. as of september30,
2006, the company had remaining authorization in place to repurchase approximately 206million additional shares. the repurchase program does not have an expiration date.  the par value of the companys outstanding common stock totaled approximately $25 million.  the company also has 1.0 billion shares of internet group stock at $.01 par value authorized. no shares are issued and outstanding.
equity based compensation  under various plans, the company may grant stock options and other equity based awards to executive, management, and creative personnel. in december
2004, the company adopted a new approach to long-term incentive compensation, pursuant to which it increased the proportion of restricted stock units (rsus) and decreased the proportion of stock options used in long-term incentive awards.
stock options are generally granted at exercise prices equal to or exceeding the market price at the date of grant. effective in january
2003, options became exercisable ratably over a four-year period from the grant date, while options granted prior to january 2003 generally vest ratably over five years. effective in the second quarter of 2005, options granted generally expire seven
years after the grant date, while options granted prior to the second quarter of 2005 generally expire ten years after the date of grant. at the discretion of the compensation committee of the companys board of directors, options can
occasionally extend up to 15 years after date of grant. restricted stock
-105-
table of contents
units generally vest 50% on each of the second and fourth anniversaries of the grant date. certain rsus awarded to senior executives vest based upon the
achievement of performance conditions. stock options and rsus are forfeited by employees who terminate prior to vesting. shares available for future option and rsu grants at september30, 2006 totaled 51 million. the company satisfies stock
option exercises and vesting of rsus with newly issued shares.  each year during the second quarter, the company awards stock options and
restricted stock units to a broad-based group of management and creative personnel (the annual grant). prior to the fiscal 2006 annual grant, the fair value of options granted was estimated on the grant date using the black-scholes option pricing
model. beginning with the fiscal 2006 annual grant, the company has changed to the binomial valuation model. the binomial valuation model considers certain characteristics of fair value option pricing that are not considered under the black-scholes
model. similar to the black-scholes model, the binomial valuation model takes into account variables such as volatility, dividend yield, and the risk free interest rate. however, the binomial valuation model also considers the expected exercise
multiple (the multiple of exercise price to grant price at which exercises are expected to occur on average) and the termination rate (the probability of a vested option being cancelled due to the termination of the option holder) in computing the
value of the option. accordingly, the company believes that the binomial valuation model should produce a fair value that is more representative of the value of an employee option.  in fiscal years 2006, 2005, and 2004, the weighted average assumptions used in the option-pricing models were as follows:

commencing with the 2006 annual grant, the company utilized the binomial valuation model.

the company utilized the black-scholes model during fiscal 2005 and fiscal 2004.  although the initial fair value of stock options is not adjusted after the grant date, changes in the companys assumptions may change the value of,
and therefore the expense related to, future stock option grants. the assumptions that cause the greatest variation in fair value in the binomial valuation model are the assumed volatility and expected exercise multiple. increases or decreases in
either the assumed volatility or expected exercise multiple will cause the binomial option value to increase or decrease, respectively.  the volatility assumption for fiscal 2006 and 2005 considers both historical and implied volatility and may be impacted by the companys performance as well as changes in economic and market conditions. volatility for fiscal 2004 was
estimated based upon historical share-price volatility.  compensation expense for rsus and stock options is recognized ratably over the
vesting period. compensation expense for rsus is based upon the market price of the shares underlying the awards on the grant date; however, compensation expense for performance-based awards is adjusted to reflect the estimated probability of
vesting.

rsus representing 2.2million shares, 1.3million shares, and 0.3million shares
that vest based upon the achievement of certain performance conditions were granted in 2006, 2005, and 2004, respectively. approximately 3.9million of the unvested rsus as of september30, 2006 vest upon the achievement of performance
conditions.  the weighted average grant-date fair values of options granted during 2006, 2005, and 2004 were $7.26, $7.71 and $9.94,
respectively. the total intrinsic value (market value on date of exercise less exercise price) of options exercised and rsus vested during 2006, 2005, and 2004 totaled $506 million, $198 million, and $68 million, respectively. the aggregate
intrinsic values of stock options outstanding and exercisable at september 30, 2006 were $1.4 billion and $746 million, respectively.  as
of september30, 2006, there was $500 million of unrecognized compensation cost related to unvested stock options and $261 million related to unvested rsus. that cost is expected to be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.9 years for
stock options and rsus.  cash received from option exercises for 2006, 2005, and 2004 was $1.1 billion, $370 million, and $201 million,
respectively. tax benefits realized from tax deductions associated with option exercises and rsu activity for 2006, 2005, and 2004 totaled $180 million, $69 million, and $25 million, respectively.  in connection with the acquisition of pixar on may5, 2006, the company converted previously issued vested and unvested pixar stock-based awards
into disney stock-based awards consisting of 44million stock options and 1million rsus. the fair value of these stock option awards was estimated using the black-scholes option pricing model, as the information required to use the
binomial valuation model was not reasonably available. the methodology utilized to determine the assumptions in the black-scholes model was consistent with that used by the company for its option-pricing models.

financial instruments  interest rate risk management
the company is exposed to the impact of interest rate changes primarily through its borrowing activities. the companys objective
is to mitigate the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and on the market value of its investments and borrowings. in accordance with policy, the company maintains its fixed rate debt expressed as a percentage of its net debt
between a minimum and maximum percentage.  the company typically uses pay-floating and pay-fixed interest rate swaps to facilitate its
interest rate risk management activities. pay-floating swaps effectively convert fixed rate medium and long-term obligations to variable rate instruments indexed to libor. pay-floating swap agreements in place at year-end expire in 1 to 16 years.
pay-fixed swaps effectively convert floating rate obligations to fixed rate instruments. the pay-fixed swaps in place at year-end expire in 2 to 9 years. as of september30, 2006 and october1, 2005 respectively, the company held $192
million and $151 million notional value of pay-fixed swaps that do not qualify as hedges. the changes in market values of all swaps that do not qualify as hedges have been included in earnings.  the impact of hedge ineffectiveness was not significant for fiscal 2006, 2005, and 2004. the net amount of deferred gains in aoci from interest rate risk
management transactions was $5 million and $8 million at september30, 2006 and october1, 2005 respectively.  foreign exchange risk
management  the company transacts business globally and is subject to risks associated with changing foreign exchange rates. the
companys objective is to reduce earnings and cash flow fluctuations associated with foreign exchange rate changes thereby enabling management to focus attention on core business issues and challenges.  the company enters into various contracts that change in value as foreign exchange rates change to protect the value of its existing foreign currency
assets, liabilities, firm commitments and forecasted but not firmly committed foreign currency transactions. the company uses option strategies and forward contracts to hedge forecasted transactions. in accordance with policy, the company hedges its
forecasted foreign currency transactions for periods generally not to exceed five years within an established minimum and maximum range of annual exposure. the company uses forward contracts to hedge foreign currency assets, liabilities and firm
commitments. the gains and losses on these contracts offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related forecasted transaction, asset, liability or firm commitment. the principal currencies hedged are the euro, british pound, japanese
yen and canadian dollar. cross-currency swaps are used to effectively convert foreign currency-denominated borrowings to u.s. dollars.  mark to market gains and losses on contracts hedging forecasted foreign currency transactions are initially recorded to aoci and are reclassified to current earnings when the hedged transactions are realized, offsetting changes in the value
of the foreign currency transactions. at september30, 2006 and october1, 2005, the company had pre-tax deferred gains of $106 million and $114 million, respectively, and pre-tax deferred losses of $60 million and $69 million,
respectively, related to cash flow hedges on forecasted foreign currency transactions.  deferred amounts to be recognized in earnings will
change with market conditions and will be substantially offset by changes in the value of the related hedged transactions. deferred losses recorded in aoci for contracts that will mature in the next twelve months totaled $15 million. the company
reclassified after-tax losses of $6 million and $108 million from aoci to earnings during fiscal 2006 and 2005, respectively. these losses were offset by changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the items being hedged.  during fiscal 2006 and 2005, the company recorded the change in fair market value related to fair value hedges and the ineffectiveness related to cash
flow hedges to earnings. the amounts of hedge ineffectiveness on cash flow hedges were not material for fiscal 2006, fiscal 2005, and fiscal 2004. the total impact of foreign exchange risk management activities on operating income in 2006, 2005, and
2004 were losses of $27 million, $168 million, and $277 million, respectively. the net losses from these hedges offset changes in the u.s. dollar equivalent value of the related exposures being hedged.

credit concentrations  the company continually monitors its positions with, and the credit quality of, the financial institutions that are counterparties to its financial instruments and does not anticipate nonperformance by the
counterparties.  the company would not realize a material loss as of september30, 2006 in the event of nonperformance by any single
counterparty. the company enters into transactions only with financial institution counterparties that have a credit rating of a- or better. the companys current policy regarding agreements with financial institution counterparties is
generally to require collateral in the event credit ratings fall below a- or in the event aggregate exposures exceed limits as defined by contract. in addition, the company limits the amount of investment credit exposure with any one institution.
the companys trade receivables and investments do not represent a significant concentration of credit risk at september30,
2006 due to the wide variety of customers and markets into which the companys products are sold, their dispersion across geographic areas, and the diversification of the companys portfolio among issuers.
commitments and contingencies  commitments  the company has various contractual
commitments for the purchase of broadcast rights for sports, feature films and other programming, aggregating approximately $20.5 billion, including approximately $1.0 billion for available programming as of september30, 2006, and
approximately $16.6 billion related to sports programming rights, primarily nfl, nascar, mlb, and college football.  the company has
entered into operating leases for various real estate and equipment needs, including retail outlets and distribution centers for consumer products, broadcast equipment, and office space for general and administrative purposes. rental expense for the
operating leases during 2006, 2005, and 2004, including common-area maintenance and contingent rentals, was $455 million, $482 million, and $518 million, respectively.  the company also has contractual commitments under various creative talent and employment agreements including obligations to actors, producers, sports personnel, television and radio personalities, and executives.

contractual guarantees  the company has guaranteed certain special assessment and water/sewer revenue bonds issued by the celebration community development district and the enterprise community development district (collectively, the
districts). the bond proceeds were used by the districts to finance the construction of infrastructure improvements and the water and sewer system in the mixed-use, residential community of celebration, florida. as of september30, 2006, the
remaining debt service obligation guaranteed by the company was $70 million, of which $45 million was principal. the company is responsible to satisfy any shortfalls in debt service payments, debt service and maintenance reserve funds, and to ensure
compliance with specified rate covenants. to the extent that the company has to fund payments under its guarantees, the districts have an obligation to reimburse the company from district revenues.  the company has also guaranteed certain bond issuances by the anaheim public authority that were used by the city of anaheim to finance construction of
infrastructure and a public parking facility adjacent to the disneyland resort. revenues from sales, occupancy and property taxes from the disneyland resort and non-disney hotels are used by the city of anaheim to repay the bonds. in the event of a
debt service shortfall, the company will be responsible to fund the shortfall. as of september30, 2006, the remaining debt service obligation guaranteed by the company was $392 million, of which $106 million was principal. to the extent that
tax revenues exceed the debt service payments in subsequent periods, the company would be reimbursed for any previously funded shortfalls.  to date, tax revenues have exceeded the debt service payments for both the celebration and anaheim bonds.

legal matters  milne and disney enterprises, inc. v. stephen slesinger, inc. on november5, 2002, clare milne, the granddaughter of a. a. milne, author of the winnie the pooh books, and the companys subsidiary disney enterprises, inc.
(dei) filed a complaint against stephen slesinger, inc. (ssi) in the united states district court for the central district of california. on november4, 2002, ms.milne served notices to ssi and dei terminating a.a. milnes
prior grant of rights to winnie the pooh, effective november5, 2004, and granted all of those rights to dei. in their lawsuit, ms.milne and dei sought a declaratory judgment, under united states copyright law, that ms.milnes
termination notices were valid; that ssis rights to winnie the pooh in the united states terminated effective november5, 2004; that upon termination of ssis rights in the united states, the 1983 licensing agreement that is the
subject of the stephen slesinger, inc. v. the walt disney company lawsuit terminated by operation of law; and that, as of november5, 2004, ssi was entitled to no further royalties for uses of winnie the pooh. ssi filed (a)an answer
denying the material allegations of the complaint and (b)counterclaims seeking a declaration that (i)ms.milnes grant of rights to dei is void and unenforceable and (ii)dei remains obligated to pay ssi royalties under
the 1983 licensing agreement. the district court ruled that milnes termination notices were invalid. the court of appeals for the ninth circuit affirmed, and on june26, 2006, the united states supreme court denied milnes petition
for a writ of certiorari. on june23, 2003, ssi filed an amended answer and counterclaims and a third-party complaint against harriet hunt (heir to e. h. shepard, illustrator of the original winnie the pooh stories), who had served a notice of
termination and a grant of rights similar to ms.milnes, and asserted counterclaims against the company allegedly arising from the milne and hunt terminations and the grant of rights to dei for (a)unlawful and unfair business
practices; and (b)breach of the 1983 licensing agreement.  on october19, 2006, the parties stipulated to ssis filing its
fourth amended answer and counterclaims (fourth amended answer) seeking (a)to invalidate the hunt termination notice, (b)to terminate the companys rights vis--vis ssi, and (c)damages in excess of two billion dollars,
among other relief. that stipulation also provided that hunt and the company need not respond to the fourth amended answer until the conclusion of two events: the state court appeal in stephen slesinger, inc. v. the walt disney company, and
the trial in the district court on the validity of the hunt termination notice. ssi then sought to withdraw both the fourth amended answer and its stipulation, but on november3, 2006, the court denied that request and ordered that the hunt
termination trial commence on march20, 2007.  stephen slesinger, inc. v. the walt disney company. in this lawsuit, filed on
february27, 1991 in the los angeles county superior court, the plaintiff claims that a company subsidiary defrauded it and breached a 1983 licensing agreement with respect to certain winnie the pooh properties, by failing to account for and
pay royalties on revenues earned from the sale of winnie the pooh movies on videocassette and from the exploitation of winnie the pooh merchandising rights. the plaintiff seeks damages for the licensees alleged breaches as well as confirmation
of the plaintiffs interpretation of the licensing agreement with respect to future activities. the plaintiff also seeks the right to terminate the agreement on the basis of the alleged breaches. if each of the plaintiffs claims were to
be confirmed in a final judgment, damages as argued by the plaintiff could total as much as several hundred million dollars and adversely impact the value to the company of any future exploitation of the licensed rights. on march29, 2004, the
court granted the companys motion for terminating sanctions against the plaintiff for a host of discovery abuses, including the withholding, alteration, and theft of documents and other information, and, on april5, 2004, dismissed
plaintiffs case with prejudice. plaintiffs subsequent attempts to disqualify the judge who granted the terminating sanctions were denied in 2004, and its motion for a new trial was denied on january26, 2005, allowing
plaintiff to proceed with its noticed appeal from the april5, 2004, order of dismissal. argument of the appeal has not been scheduled.  management believes that it is not currently possible to estimate the impact, if any, that the ultimate resolution of these matters will have on the companys results of operations, financial position or cash flows.  the company, together with, in some instances, certain of its directors and officers, is a defendant or co-defendant in various other legal actions
involving copyright, breach of contract and various other claims incident to the conduct of its businesses. management does not expect the company to suffer any material liability by reason of such actions.

corporation (comcast), the company sold its 39.5% interest in e!entertainment television (e!) to comcast (which owned the remainder of the interests in e!) for $1.2 billion, which resulted in a pre-tax gain of approximately $0.8 billion ($0.5
billion after-tax), which will be recorded in the first quarter of fiscal 2007.
