THE GROWTH IN THE NUMBER OF NETWORKS DISTRIBUTED BY MVPDS HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES FOR ADVERTISING REVENUES FOR OUR BROADCASTING AND CABLE NETWORKS. THE COMPANY’S CABLE NETWORKS ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM OTHER CABLE NETWORKS FOR CARRIAGE BY MVPDS. THE COMPANY’S CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH MVPDS ARE RENEWED OR RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE CABLE AND SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS VARIOUS CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE.

THE COMPANY’S MEDIA NETWORKS BUSINESSES ALSO COMPETE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING. THE MARKET FOR PROGRAMMING IS VERY COMPETITIVE, PARTICULARLY FOR SPORTS PROGRAMMING. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS SPORTS RIGHTS AGREEMENTS WITH THE NFL, COLLEGE FOOTBALL (INCLUDING COLLEGE FOOTBALL BOWL GAMES) AND BASKETBALL CONFERENCES, NBA, NASCAR, MLB, WORLD CUP AND VARIOUS SOCCER LEAGUES, AND GOLF AND TENNIS ASSOCIATIONS.

THE COMPANY’S INTERNET WEBSITES AND DIGITAL PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH OTHER WEBSITES AND ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS IN THEIR RESPECTIVE CATEGORIES.

ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE MEDIA NETWORKS ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS ARE MET. THESE COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE COMPANY’S FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION DURING THIS PERIOD.

FEDERAL REGULATION

TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION (FCC) UNDER FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. VIOLATION OF FCC REGULATIONS CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY FORFEITURES, LIMITED RENEWALS OF LICENSES AND, IN EGREGIOUS CASES, DENIAL OF LICENSE RENEWAL OR REVOCATION OF A LICENSE. FCC REGULATIONS THAT AFFECT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

•

LICENSING OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS.

EACH OF THE TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE OWN MUST BE LICENSED BY THE FCC. THESE LICENSES ARE GRANTED FOR PERIODS OF UP TO EIGHT YEARS, AND WE MUST OBTAIN RENEWAL OF LICENSES AS THEY EXPIRE IN ORDER TO CONTINUE OPERATING THE STATIONS. WE (OR THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN THE CASE OF A DIVESTITURE) MUST ALSO OBTAIN FCC APPROVAL WHENEVER WE SEEK TO HAVE A LICENSE TRANSFERRED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION OR DIVESTITURE OF A STATION. THE FCC MAY DECLINE TO RENEW OR APPROVE THE TRANSFER OF A LICENSE IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES AND MAY DELAY RENEWALS WHILE PERMITTING A LICENSEE TO CONTINUE OPERATING. THE FCC HAS DELAYED RENEWALS FOR A NUMBER OF BROADCAST LICENSEES, INCLUDING A NUMBER OF OUR LICENSES, IN RECENT YEARS WHILE PERMITTING THE LICENSEES TO CONTINUE OPERATING. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE RECEIVED SUCH RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE PAST OR HAVE BEEN PERMITTED TO CONTINUE OPERATIONS WHEN RENEWAL IS DELAYED, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THIS WILL BE THE CASE IN THE FUTURE.

•

TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP LIMITS.

THE FCC IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON THE NUMBER OF TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SPECIFIC MARKET, ON THE COMBINED NUMBER OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A SINGLE MARKET AND ON THE AGGREGATE PERCENTAGE OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE THAT CAN BE REACHED BY TELEVISION STATIONS WE OWN. CURRENTLY.

▪

FCC REGULATIONS MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN A MARKET, DEPENDING ON THE SIZE AND NATURE OF THE MARKET. WE DO NOT OWN MORE THAN ONE TELEVISION STATION IN ANY OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN A TELEVISION STATION.

▪

FEDERAL STATUTES PERMIT OUR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE AGGREGATE TO REACH A MAXIMUM OF 39% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE (FOR THIS PURPOSE, FCC REGULATIONS ATTRIBUTE TO UHF TELEVISION STATIONS ONLY 50% OF THE TELEVISION HOUSEHOLDS IN THEIR MARKET). FOR PURPOSES OF THE FCC’S RULES, OUR EIGHT STATIONS REACH APPROXIMATELY 21% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

▪

FCC REGULATIONS IN SOME CASES IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL RADIO OR TELEVISION STATIONS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN RADIO STATIONS, BUT WE DO NOT BELIEVE ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS ARE MATERIAL TO OUR CURRENT OPERATING PLANS.

•

DUAL NETWORKS.

FCC RULES CURRENTLY PROHIBIT ANY OF THE FOUR MAJOR TELEVISION NETWORKS — ABC, CBS, FOX AND NBC — FROM BEING UNDER COMMON OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL.

•

REGULATION OF PROGRAMMING.

THE FCC REGULATES BROADCAST PROGRAMMING BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BANNING “INDECENT” PROGRAMMING, REGULATING POLITICAL ADVERTISING AND IMPOSING COMMERCIAL TIME LIMITS DURING CHILDREN’S PROGRAMMING. PENALTIES FOR BROADCASTING INDECENT PROGRAMMING ARE A MAXIMUM OF $325,000 PER STATION.

FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND FCC RULES ALSO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL MATTER THAT MAY BE SHOWN ON BROADCAST OR CABLE CHANNELS DURING PROGRAMMING DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN 12 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. IN ADDITION, BROADCAST CHANNELS ARE GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF THREE HOURS PER WEEK OF PROGRAMMING THAT HAS AS A “SIGNIFICANT PURPOSE” MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN 16 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. FCC RULES ALSO GIVE TELEVISION STATION OWNERS THE RIGHT TO REJECT OR REFUSE NETWORK PROGRAMMING IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO SUBSTITUTE PROGRAMMING THAT THE LICENSEE REASONABLY BELIEVES TO BE OF GREATER LOCAL OR NATIONAL IMPORTANCE.

•

CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF BROADCAST TELEVISION STATIONS.

WITH RESPECT TO CABLE SYSTEMS OPERATING WITHIN A TELEVISION STATION’S DESIGNATED MARKET AREA, FCC RULES REQUIRE THAT EVERY THREE YEARS EACH TELEVISION STATION ELECT EITHER “MUST CARRY” STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH CABLE OPERATORS GENERALLY MUST CARRY A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION IN THE STATION’S MARKET, OR “RETRANSMISSION CONSENT” STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE CABLE OPERATOR MUST NEGOTIATE WITH THE TELEVISION STATION TO OBTAIN THE CONSENT OF THE TELEVISION STATION PRIOR TO CARRYING ITS SIGNAL. UNDER THE SATELLITE HOME VIEWER IMPROVEMENT ACT AND ITS SUCCESSORS, INCLUDING MOST RECENTLY THE SATELLITE TELEVISION EXTENSION AND LOCALISM ACT (STELA), WHICH ALSO REQUIRES THE “MUST CARRY” OR “RETRANSMISSION CONSENT” ELECTION, SATELLITE CARRIERS ARE PERMITTED TO RETRANSMIT A LOCAL TELEVISION STATION’S SIGNAL INTO ITS LOCAL MARKET WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LOCAL TELEVISION STATION. PORTIONS OF THESE SATELLITE LAWS ARE SET TO EXPIRE ON DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND LEGISLATIVE DISCUSSIONS ARE UNDERWAY WITH RESPECT TO THEIR RENEWAL. UNDER “MUST CARRY,” IF A SATELLITE CARRIER ELECTS TO CARRY ONE LOCAL STATION IN A MARKET, THE SATELLITE CARRIER MUST CARRY THE SIGNALS OF ALL LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS THAT ALSO REQUEST CARRIAGE.

•

CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF PROGRAMMING.

THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND FCC RULES REGULATE SOME ASPECTS OF NEGOTIATIONS REGARDING CABLE AND SATELLITE RETRANSMISSION CONSENT, AND SOME CABLE AND SATELLITE COMPANIES HAVE SOUGHT REGULATION OF ADDITIONAL ASPECTS OF THE CARRIAGE OF PROGRAMMING ON CABLE AND SATELLITE SYSTEMS. NEW LEGISLATION, COURT ACTION OR REGULATION IN THIS AREA COULD, DEPENDING ON ITS SPECIFIC NATURE, HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS.

THE FOREGOING IS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND OTHER LEGISLATION AND OF SPECIFIC FCC RULES AND POLICIES. REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE TO THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT, OTHER LEGISLATION, FCC RULES AND PUBLIC NOTICES AND RULINGS OF THE FCC FOR FURTHER INFORMATION CONCERNING THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FCC’S REGULATORY AUTHORITY.

FCC LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE, AND THE COMPANY GENERALLY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER NEW LEGISLATION, COURT ACTION OR REGULATIONS, OR A CHANGE IN THE EXTENT OF APPLICATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF CURRENT LAWS AND REGULATIONS, WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS.

ITEM 1A.  RISK FACTORS

FOR AN ENTERPRISE AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS THE COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS AFFECTING SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPERATIONS IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THESE OPERATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

CHANGES IN U.S., GLOBAL, OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES.

A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE U.S. AND OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, THUS REDUCING OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS. THE MOST RECENT DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REDUCED SPENDING AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS, PURCHASE OF AND PRICES FOR ADVERTISING ON OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND OWNED STATIONS, PERFORMANCE OF OUR HOME ENTERTAINMENT RELEASES, AND PURCHASES OF COMPANY-BRANDED CONSUMER PRODUCTS, AND SIMILAR IMPACTS CAN BE EXPECTED SHOULD SUCH CONDITIONS RECUR. A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO REDUCE ATTENDANCE AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS OR PRICES THAT MVPDS PAY FOR OUR CABLE PROGRAMMING. RECENT INSTABILITY IN EUROPEAN ECONOMIES PRESENTS

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISKS OF SIMILAR IMPACTS IN OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CAN ALSO IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THOSE WITH WHOM WE DO BUSINESS TO SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN PRICE LEVELS GENERALLY, OR IN PRICE LEVELS IN A PARTICULAR SECTOR SUCH AS THE ENERGY SECTOR, COULD RESULT IN A SHIFT IN CONSUMER DEMAND AWAY FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS WE OFFER, WHICH COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASE OUR COSTS. CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY REDUCE INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCREASE OUR LABOR OR SUPPLY COSTS IN NON-U.S. MARKETS, OR REDUCE THE U.S. DOLLAR VALUE OF REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER MARKETS, AND ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN A COUNTRY COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COUNTRY OR OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE REVENUE FROM THE COUNTRY.

CHANGES IN PUBLIC AND CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES CREATE ENTERTAINMENT, TRAVEL OR CONSUMER PRODUCTS WHOSE SUCCESS DEPENDS SUBSTANTIALLY ON CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES THAT CHANGE IN OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO CONSISTENTLY CREATE AND DISTRIBUTE FILMED ENTERTAINMENT, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ONLINE MATERIAL, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, HOTELS AND OTHER RESORT FACILITIES AND TRAVEL EXPERIENCES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE CHANGING PREFERENCES OF THE BROAD CONSUMER MARKET AND RESPOND TO COMPETITION FROM AN EXPANDING ARRAY OF CHOICES FACILITATED BY TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS IN THE DELIVERY OF CONTENT. MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON ACCEPTANCE OF OUR OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS BY CONSUMERS OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND THEIR SUCCESS THEREFORE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT AND ADAPT TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES OUTSIDE AS WELL AS INSIDE THE U.S. MOREOVER, WE MUST OFTEN INVEST SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS IN FILM PRODUCTION, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, CRUISE SHIPS OR HOTELS AND OTHER RESORT FACILITIES BEFORE WE LEARN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PRODUCTS WILL EARN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. IF OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, OUR REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING SALES (WHICH ARE BASED IN PART ON RATINGS FOR THE PROGRAMS IN WHICH ADVERTISEMENTS AIR) OR SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING AND ONLINE SERVICES, FROM THEATRICAL FILM RECEIPTS OR HOME VIDEO OR ELECTRONIC GAME SALES, FROM THEME PARK ADMISSIONS, HOTEL ROOM CHARGES AND MERCHANDISE, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES, FROM SALES OF LICENSED CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR FROM SALES OF OUR OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY DECLINE OR FAIL TO GROW TO THE EXTENT WE ANTICIPATE WHEN MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES.

CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND IN CONSUMER CONSUMPTION PATTERNS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, THE REVENUE WE CAN GENERATE FROM THESE PRODUCTS OR THE COST OF PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING PRODUCTS.

THE MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT AND INTERNET BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE, DEVELOP, ADOPT AND EXPLOIT NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO DISTINGUISH OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGIES AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THE MANNER AND MARKETS IN WHICH OUR PRODUCTS ARE DISTRIBUTED TO CONSUMERS, THE SOURCES OF COMPETING TELEVISION AND FILMED ENTERTAINMENT, THE TIME AND MANNER IN WHICH CONSUMERS ACQUIRE AND VIEW SOME OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO ADVERTISERS FOR REACHING THEIR DESIRED MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SUCCESS OF OUR OFFERINGS IN THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET DEPENDS IN PART ON CONSUMER PREFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO HOME ENTERTAINMENT FORMATS. THESE FORMATS INCLUDE WEB-BASED DELIVERY OF LIVE AND STORED VIDEO ENTERTAINMENT, DVD PLAYERS AND DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDERS, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE HOME ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND TECHNOLOGIES.  SUCH TECHNOLOGIES MAY PROVIDE USERS THE ABILITY TO FAST-FORWARD, REWIND, PAUSE AND SKIP PROGRAMMING AND ADVERTISEMENTS. IN ADDITION, TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OFFER CONSUMERS AN EXPANDING ARRAY OF ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS AND DELIVERY VEHICLES, WHICH FRAGMENTS THE MARKET FOR OUR PRODUCTS. THESE DEVELOPMENTS HAVE ALSO LED TO AN INDUSTRY WIDE DECLINE IN RATINGS FOR BROADCAST TELEVISION AND TO A REDUCTION IN DEMAND FOR DVDS OF THEATRICAL CONTENT AND MAY DISRUPT TRADITIONAL DISTRIBUTION MODELS BY ENABLING CONTENT OWNERS TO PROVIDE CONTENT DIRECTLY TO DISTRIBUTORS AND CONSUMERS, WHICH COULD LEAD TO DECREASED DEMAND FOR CONTENT DISTRIBUTED ON OUR BROADCAST OR CABLE NETWORKS.  IN ORDER TO RESPOND TO THESE DEVELOPMENTS, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO ALTER OUR BUSINESS MODELS AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCESSFULLY RESPOND TO THESE CHANGES OR THAT THE BUSINESS MODELS WE DEVELOP IN RESPONSE TO THESE CHANGES WILL BE AS PROFITABLE AS OUR CURRENT BUSINESS MODELS. AS A RESULT, THE INCOME FROM OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS MAY DECLINE OR INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OR OUR EXPECTATIONS WHEN WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCTS.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE EXISTENCE AND MAINTENANCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE CREATE.

THE VALUE TO US OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF OUR RIGHTS AS DEFINED BY APPLICABLE LAWS IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THOSE LAWS ARE CONSTRUED. IF THOSE LAWS ARE DRAFTED OR INTERPRETED IN WAYS THAT LIMIT THE EXTENT OR DURATION OF OUR RIGHTS, OR IF EXISTING LAWS ARE CHANGED, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY DECREASE, OR THE COST OF OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF PROTECTING THESE RIGHTS OR REDUCE OUR REVENUES. NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION, AND ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES, THE FALLING PRICES OF DEVICES INCORPORATING SUCH TECHNOLOGIES, INCREASED BROADBAND INTERNET SPEED AND PENETRATION AND INCREASED AVAILABILITY AND SPEED OF MOBILE DATA TRANSMISSION HAVE MADE THE UNAUTHORIZED DIGITAL COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR FILMS, TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND OTHER CREATIVE WORKS EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MORE CHALLENGING. THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY GENERALLY CONTINUES TO BE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS HOLDERS. INADEQUATE LAWS OR WEAK ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN ONE COUNTRY CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE, DESPITE THE COMPANY’S EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THESE DEVELOPMENTS REQUIRE US TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST UNLICENSED USE AND PRESENT THE RISK OF INCREASED LOSSES OF REVENUE AS A RESULT OF UNLICENSED DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION OF OUR CONTENT AND SALES OF UNAUTHORIZED DVDS, BLU-RAY DISCS AND OTHER PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE COMPANY AND RIGHTS ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY FROM OTHERS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF CHALLENGES TO OUR COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK AND PATENT RIGHTS BY THIRD PARTIES. SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGES TO OUR RIGHTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS FOR OBTAINING RIGHTS OR THE LOSS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN REVENUE FROM THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF CHALLENGED RIGHTS. THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF ANY CHALLENGES TO ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT IT CURRENTLY FORESEES HAVING A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS.

PROTECTION OF ELECTRONICALLY STORED DATA IS COSTLY AND IF OUR DATA IS COMPROMISED IN SPITE OF THIS PROTECTION, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS, LOST OPPORTUNITIES AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

WE MAINTAIN INFORMATION NECESSARY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AS WELL AS PERSONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES, IN DIGITAL FORM. DATA MAINTAINED IN DIGITAL FORM IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF INTRUSION, TAMPERING AND THEFT. WE DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SYSTEMS TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING, BUT THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS IS COSTLY AND REQUIRES ONGOING MONITORING AND UPDATING AS TECHNOLOGIES CHANGE AND EFFORTS TO OVERCOME SECURITY MEASURES BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED. MOREOVER, DESPITE OUR EFFORTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF INTRUSION, TAMPERING AND THEFT CANNOT BE ELIMINATED ENTIRELY, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE REMAIN. IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE CONFIDENTIAL, PROPRIETARY AND PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. WHILE WE OBTAIN ASSURANCES THAT THESE THIRD PARTIES WILL PROTECT THIS INFORMATION AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, MONITOR THE PROTECTIONS EMPLOYED BY THESE THIRD PARTIES, THERE IS A RISK THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES MAY BE COMPROMISED. IF OUR DATA SYSTEMS ARE COMPROMISED, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS MAY BE IMPAIRED, WE MAY LOSE PROFITABLE OPPORTUNITIES OR THE VALUE OF THOSE OPPORTUNITIES MAY BE DIMINISHED AND, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE MAY LOSE REVENUE AS A RESULT OF UNLICENSED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. IF PERSONAL INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES IS MISAPPROPRIATED, OUR REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES MAY BE INJURED RESULTING IN LOSS OF BUSINESS OR MORALE, AND WE MAY INCUR COSTS TO REMEDIATE POSSIBLE INJURY TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES OR TO PAY FINES OR TAKE OTHER ACTION WITH RESPECT TO JUDICIAL OR REGULATORY ACTIONS ARISING OUT OF THE INCIDENT.

A VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR INCREASE THE COST OF PROVIDING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, PARTICULARLY OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS, IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM. THE ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM, AS WELL AS DEMAND FOR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE U.S., GLOBALLY OR IN SPECIFIC REGIONS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING: ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARISING FROM SHORT-TERM WEATHER PATTERNS OR LONG-TERM CHANGE, CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR NATURAL DISASTERS (SUCH AS EXCESSIVE HEAT OR RAIN, HURRICANES, TYPHOONS, FLOODS, TSUNAMIS AND EARTHQUAKES); HEALTH CONCERNS; INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL OR MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS; AND TERRORIST ATTACKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN JAPAN IN MARCH 2011 RESULTED IN A PERIOD OF SUSPENSION OF OUR OPERATIONS AND THOSE OF CERTAIN OF OUR LICENSEES IN JAPAN, INCLUDING TOKYO DISNEY RESORT AND RESULTED IN A LOSS OF REVENUE FROM THOSE OPERATIONS. THESE EVENTS AND OTHERS, SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN TRAVEL AND ENERGY COSTS AND COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACKS, INTRUSIONS OR OTHER WIDESPREAD COMPUTING OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, MAY ALSO DAMAGE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THESE EVENTS. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE ROYALTIES FROM THE SALES OF OUR LICENSED GOODS AND SERVICES BY THIRD PARTIES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESSES OPERATED UNDER BRANDS LICENSED FROM THE COMPANY, AND WE ARE THEREFORE DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESSES OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES FOR THAT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE. A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS COULD INFLUENCE THE SUCCESS OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES AND IF NEGATIVE FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF OUR LICENSEES, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE OBTAIN INSURANCE AGAINST THE RISK OF LOSSES RELATING TO SOME OF THESE EVENTS, GENERALLY INCLUDING PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO OUR PROPERTY AND RESULTING BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, CERTAIN INJURIES OCCURRING ON OUR PROPERTY AND LIABILITY FOR ALLEGED BREACH OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WHEN INSURANCE IS OBTAINED IT IS SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES, EXCLUSIONS, TERMS, CONDITIONS AND LIMITS OF LIABILITY. THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF COVERAGE WE OBTAIN VARY FROM TIME TO TIME DEPENDING ON OUR VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SPECIFIC TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS IN RELATION TO THE COST OF OBTAINING COVERAGE FOR SUCH TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS.

IN RECENT YEARS, SUCH INVESTMENTS HAVE INCLUDED EXPANSION AND REPURPOSING OF CERTAIN OF OUR THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS AND PARTICIPATION IN A JOINT VENTURE THAT IS CONSTRUCTING A THEME PARK IN SHANGHAI, CHINA. SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS MAY HAVE SHORT-TERM RETURNS THAT ARE NEGATIVE OR LOW AND THE ULTIMATE BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES MAY BE UNCERTAIN. IN ANY OF THESE EVENTS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE, WE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS OR RETURNS ON NEW INVESTMENTS MAY BE LOWER THAN PRIOR TO THE CHANGE IN STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING.

TURMOIL IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND IMPEDE ACCESS TO OR INCREASE THE COST OF FINANCING OUR OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS.

PAST DISRUPTIONS IN THE U.S. AND GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY BUSINESSES TO OBTAIN FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. THESE CONDITIONS TENDED TO INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING AND IF THEY RECUR, OUR COST OF BORROWING COULD INCREASE AND IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES THAT ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANY’S PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. A DECREASE IN THESE RATINGS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING. PAST DISRUPTIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS ALSO IMPACTED SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. A SIMILAR DECLINE IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SECURE CREDIT-WORTHY COUNTERPARTIES FOR OUR INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING PROGRAMS AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SETTLE EXISTING CONTRACTS.

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES FROM ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER AND FROM OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO MUST COMPETE TO OBTAIN HUMAN RESOURCES, PROGRAMMING AND OTHER RESOURCES WE REQUIRE IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE.

•

OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS, STATIONS AND ONLINE OFFERINGS COMPETE FOR VIEWERS WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES AS WELL AS WITH HOME VIDEO PRODUCTS AND INTERNET USAGE.

•

OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND STATIONS COMPETE FOR THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES, AND THE INTERNET, AS WELL AS WITH NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES AND BILLBOARDS.

•

OUR CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR CARRIAGE OF THEIR PROGRAMMING WITH OTHER PROGRAMMING PROVIDERS.

•

OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CREATIVE TALENT AND SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING WITH OTHER BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS.

•

OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS COMPETE FOR GUESTS WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATION ACTIVITIES.

•

OUR STUDIO OPERATIONS COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT.

•

OUR STUDIO OPERATIONS, BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND PUBLISHING BUSINESSES COMPETE TO OBTAIN CREATIVE AND PERFORMING TALENT, STORY PROPERTIES, ADVERTISER SUPPORT, BROADCAST RIGHTS AND MARKET SHARE.

•

OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT COMPETES IN THE CHARACTER MERCHANDISING AND OTHER LICENSING, PUBLISHING, AND RETAIL ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER LICENSORS, PUBLISHERS AND RETAILERS OF CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES.

•

OUR INTERACTIVE GAME OPERATIONS COMPETE WITH OTHER PUBLISHERS OF CONSOLE, ONLINE AND MOBILE GAMES AND OTHER TYPES OF HOME ENTERTAINMENT.

COMPETITION IN EACH OF THESE AREAS MAY DIVERT CONSUMERS FROM OUR CREATIVE OR OTHER PRODUCTS, OR TO OTHER PRODUCTS OR OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR MARKETING COSTS. SUCH COMPETITION MAY ALSO REDUCE, OR LIMIT GROWTH IN, PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING ADVERTISING RATES AND SUBSCRIPTION FEES AT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS, PARKS AND RESORTS ADMISSIONS AND ROOM RATES, AND PRICES FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS FROM WHICH WE DERIVE LICENSE REVENUES. COMPETITION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF RESOURCES CAN INCREASE THE COST OF PRODUCING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

SUSTAINED INCREASES IN COSTS OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND OTHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELFARE BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

WITH APPROXIMATELY 175,000 EMPLOYEES, OUR PROFITABILITY IS SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED BY COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS AND CURRENT AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. WE MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THESE COSTS AS A RESULT OF MACRO-ECONOMIC

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FACTORS, WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING INCREASES IN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN INVESTMENT RETURNS AND DISCOUNT RATES USED TO CALCULATE PENSION EXPENSE AND RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE VOLATILE AND MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS IN SOME YEARS. THESE MACROECONOMIC FACTORS AS WELL AS A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ASSETS MAY PUT UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS AND MAY INCREASE FUTURE FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE COULD REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF LONG-TERM PROGRAMMING OR CARRIAGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT RENEWED ON SUFFICIENTLY FAVORABLE TERMS.

WE ENTER INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR BOTH THE ACQUISITION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS FOR SPORTING EVENTS AND OTHER PROGRAMS, AND CONTRACTS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PROGRAMMING TO MVPDS. AS THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRE, WE MUST RENEW OR RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RENEW THEM ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY LOSE PROGRAMMING RIGHTS OR DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS. EVEN IF THESE CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED, THE COST OF OBTAINING PROGRAMMING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE (OR INCREASE AT FASTER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE) OR THE TERMS ON WHICH WE DISTRIBUTE PROGRAMMING (INCLUDING THE BREADTH OF DISTRIBUTION BY A CARRIER) MAY REDUCE REVENUE FROM DISTRIBUTION OF PROGRAMS (OR INCREASE REVENUE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE). WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, THE IMPACT OF THESE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS ON OUR RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT REVENUES FROM PROGRAMMING BASED ON THESE RIGHTS WILL EXCEED THE COST OF THE RIGHTS PLUS THE OTHER COSTS OF PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAMMING.

CHANGES IN REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES MAY IMPAIR THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BROADCAST NETWORKS AND TELEVISION STATIONS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED, AND EACH OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF U.S. AND OVERSEAS REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATIONS INCLUDE.

•

U.S. FCC REGULATION OF OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO NETWORKS, OUR NATIONAL PROGRAMMING NETWORKS, AND OUR OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS. SEE ITEM 1 — BUSINESS — MEDIA NETWORKS, FEDERAL REGULATION.

•

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION REGULATIONS.

•

FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

•

REGULATION OF THE SAFETY OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND THEME PARK OPERATIONS.

•

IMPOSITION BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES OF TRADE RESTRICTIONS, OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS OR MOTION PICTURE OR TELEVISION CONTENT REQUIREMENTS OR QUOTAS.

•

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TAX LAWS OR CURRENCY CONTROLS.

CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE REGULATIONS OR REGULATORY ACTIVITIES IN ANY OF THESE AREAS MAY REQUIRE US TO SPEND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS, OR MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE PROFITABLE.

OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OPERATION OF LAWS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.

OUR OPERATIONS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS ARE IN MANY CASES SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE RATHER THAN U.S. LAW. LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS DIFFER IN SIGNIFICANT RESPECTS FROM THOSE IN THE U.S., AND THESE DIFFERENCES CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REACT TO CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND OUR RIGHTS OR ABILITY TO ENFORCE RIGHTS MAY BE DIFFERENT THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED UNDER U.S. LAW. MOREOVER, ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS IN SOME OVERSEAS JURISDICTIONS CAN BE INCONSISTENT AND UNPREDICTABLE, WHICH CAN AFFECT BOTH OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS AND TO UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE BENEFICIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. IN ADDITION, THE BUSINESS AND POLITICAL CLIMATE IN SOME JURISDICTIONS MAY ENCOURAGE CORRUPTION, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS WHILE REMAINING IN COMPLIANCE WITH LOCAL LAWS OR UNITED STATES ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES.  AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE AND OUR EXPENSES IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS MAY DIFFER FROM WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED IF U.S. LAW GOVERNED THESE OPERATIONS.

LABOR DISPUTES MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN VARIOUS OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS AS WELL AS WRITERS, DIRECTORS, ACTORS, PRODUCTION PERSONNEL AND OTHERS EMPLOYED IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS AND STUDIO OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE EMPLOYEES OF LICENSEES WHO MANUFACTURE AND RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS, AND EMPLOYEES OF PROVIDERS OF PROGRAMMING CONTENT (SUCH AS SPORTS LEAGUES) MAY BE COVERED BY LABOR AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS. IN GENERAL, A LABOR DISPUTE INVOLVING OUR EMPLOYEES OR THE EMPLOYEES OF OUR LICENSEES OR RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR PROVIDERS OF PROGRAMMING CONTENT MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUES, AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROVISIONS IN OUR CORPORATE DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE STATE LAW COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL.

OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION CONTAINS A PROVISION REGULATING THE ABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS TO BRING MATTERS FOR ACTION BEFORE ANNUAL AND SPECIAL MEETINGS AND AUTHORIZES OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE AND SET THE TERMS OF PREFERRED STOCK. THE REGULATIONS ON SHAREHOLDER ACTION COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ANY PERSON SEEKING TO ACQUIRE CONTROL OF THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF ACTIONS THAT WOULD SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD EFFECTIVELY DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF ANY PERSON SEEKING CONTROL OR OTHERWISE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN CONTROL. IN ADDITION, PROVISIONS IN OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION REQUIRE SUPERMAJORITY SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF SOME ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, EITHER OF WHICH COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE OF CONTROL IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE SEASONALITY OF CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES COULD EXACERBATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES IS NORMALLY SUBJECT TO SEASONAL VARIATIONS, AS FOLLOWS.

•

REVENUES IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. IN GENERAL, ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS ARE MET. THESE COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE COMPANY’S FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION DURING THAT PERIOD.

•

REVENUES IN OUR PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY RESULTING FROM THE SEASONAL NATURE OF VACATION TRAVEL AND LEISURE ACTIVITIES. PEAK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY GENERALLY OCCUR DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN SCHOOL VACATIONS OCCUR AND DURING EARLY-WINTER AND SPRING-HOLIDAY PERIODS.

•

REVENUES IN OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT, AND TELEVISION MARKETS. RELEASE DATES ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS.

•

REVENUES IN OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUES DURING THE COMPANY'S FIRST FISCAL QUARTER, AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF THEATRICAL RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS.

•

REVENUES IN OUR INTERACTIVE SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF VIDEO GAME RELEASES, WHICH ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING THEATRICAL RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS, COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF HOLIDAY PERIODS. REVENUES FROM CERTAIN OF OUR INTERNET AND MOBILE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR SEASONAL TRENDS.

ACCORDINGLY, IF A SHORT-TERM NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OCCURS DURING A TIME OF HIGH SEASONAL DEMAND (SUCH AS HURRICANE DAMAGE TO OUR PARKS DURING THE SUMMER TRAVEL SEASON), THE EFFECT COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF THAT BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR.

THE COMPANY’S ACQUISITION OF LUCASFILM IS EXPECTED TO CAUSE SHORT-TERM DILUTION IN EARNINGS PER SHARE AND THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANTICIPATED IMPROVEMENTS IN EARNINGS PER SHARE WILL BE REALIZED.

ON DECEMBER 21, 2012, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED LUCASFILM LTD. LLC IN A MERGER TRANSACTION IN WHICH THE COMPANY DISTRIBUTED 37.1 MILLION SHARES AND PAID $2.2 BILLION IN CASH. WE EXPECT THAT THE MERGER WILL INITIALLY RESULT IN LOWER EARNINGS PER SHARE THAN WE WOULD HAVE EARNED IN THE ABSENCE OF THE MERGER. WE EXPECT THAT OVER TIME THE MERGER WILL YIELD BENEFITS TO THE COMBINED COMPANY SUCH THAT THE MERGER WILL ULTIMATELY BE ACCRETIVE TO EARNINGS PER SHARE. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS PER SHARE EXPECTED IN THE LONG TERM WILL BE ACHIEVED. IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE INCREASES IN EARNINGS PER SHARE AS A RESULT OF THE MERGER, THE COMBINED COMPANY WILL, AMONG OTHER THINGS, NEED TO EFFECTIVELY CONTINUE THE SUCCESSFUL OPERATIONS OF LUCASFILM AFTER THE MERGER, DEVELOP SUCCESSFUL NEW CONTENT (INCLUDING FUTURE FEATURE FILMS) BASED ON LUCASFILM’S INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AND SUCCESSFULLY INTEGRATE LUCASFILM’S PRODUCTS INTO THE COMBINED COMPANY’S VARIOUS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS.

AND

LINCOLN

IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO MARVEL'S

THE AVENGERS

,

BRAVE

,

JOHN CARTER

AND

THE MUPPETS

IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

LOWER HOME ENTERTAINMENT REVENUE REFLECTED A 19% DECREASE FROM A DECLINE IN UNIT SALES.  THE DECREASE IN UNIT SALES WAS DRIVEN BY THE PERFORMANCE OF

BRAVE

,

WRECK-IT RALPH

AND

IRON MAN 3

IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO MARVEL'S

THE AVENGERS,

CARS 2, THE LION KING

DIAMOND RELEASE AND

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN: ON STRANGER TIDES

IN THE PRIOR YEAR ALONG WITH LOWER CATALOG SALES.

COST AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED AN INCREASE OF $121 MILLION IN FILM COST AMORTIZATION, FROM $1,685 MILLION TO $1,806 MILLION, DRIVEN BY MORE SIGNIFICANT TITLES IN THEATRICAL RELEASE IN THE CURRENT YEAR, INCLUDING THE TWO FEATURE ANIMATION RELEASES, AND HIGHER TV/SVOD REVENUES.

THE LONE RANGER,

MONSTERS UNIVERSITY

AND

LINCOLN

IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO MARVEL'S

THE AVENGERS

,

BRAVE, JOHN CARTER

AND

THE MUPPETS

.  THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE IMPACT OF LOWER HOME ENTERTAINMENT UNIT SALES AND LOWER FILM IMPAIRMENTS. LOWER FILM IMPAIRMENTS WERE DUE TO THE WRITE-DOWN OF

THE LONE RANGER

IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO THE WRITE-DOWN OF

JOHN CARTER

AND HIGHER DEVELOPMENT COSTS WRITE-OFFS IN THE PRIOR YEAR.  OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND COST OF GOODS SOLD, WHICH DECREASED $17 MILLION FROM $1,223 MILLION TO $1,206 MILLION DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN HOME ENTERTAINMENT UNIT SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE INCLUSION OF LUCASFILM'S SPECIAL EFFECTS BUSINESS IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER THEATRICAL MARKETING EXPENSES DRIVEN BY TWO DISNEY FEATURE ANIMATION RELEASES IN THE CURRENT YEAR COMPARED TO NONE IN THE PRIOR YEAR, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING.

THE INCREASE IN DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION WAS DUE TO AMORTIZATION OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF LUCASFILM.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REVENUES

LICENSING AND PUBLISHING REVENUES INCREASED

10%

MONSTERS UNIVERSITY

, MICKEY AND MINNIE, IRON MAN AND

PLANES

MERCHANDISE LICENSING GROWTH ALSO BENEFITED FROM HIGHER RECOGNITION OF MINIMUM GUARANTEES AND A LICENSEE AUDIT SETTLEMENT.  THE INCREASE AT PUBLISHING WAS DUE TO INTERNATIONAL SALES OF BOOKS BASED ON DISNEY CHANNEL PROPERTIES AND HIGHER REVENUES AT OUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNING CENTERS IN CHINA.

RETAIL AND OTHER REVENUE INCREASED

9%

DUE TO AN INCREASE AT OUR RETAIL BUSINESS, DRIVEN BY HIGHER COMPARABLE STORE SALES GROWTH IN NORTH AMERICA, JAPAN AND EUROPE, A NEW WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS IN NORTH AMERICA, INCREASED ONLINE SALES IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE, AND THE BENEFIT OF STORE FORMAT CHANGES IN NORTH AMERICA AND JAPAN.  THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HIGHER ADVERTISING AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY THE FULL-YEAR IMPACT OF AN AGREEMENT THAT STARTED IN FEBRUARY 2012 AT OUR JAPAN MOBILE BUSINESS, WHICH DROVE AN INCREASE IN LICENSING REVENUE FOR HANDSET SALES AND CONTENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN.

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS FOR THE YEAR INCREASED $9 MILLION TO

$500 MILLION

DUE TO HIGHER NET INCOME AT ESPN.  THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INCOME RECOGNITION AT HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT DUE TO THE TIMING OF RECOGNITION OF ROYALTY AND MANAGEMENT FEE EXPENSE AND THE IMPACT OF PRE-OPENING COSTS AT SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT.

THE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IS DETERMINED ON INCOME AFTER ROYALTIES, FINANCING COSTS AND INCOME TAXES.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT COSTS

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN COSTS AFFECT RESULTS IN ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS, WITH APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF THESE COSTS BEING BORNE BY THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN EXPENSES OF $698 MILLION, $626 MILLION AND $576 MILLION FOR FISCAL YEARS 2013, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2013 WAS DRIVEN BY A DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE AND WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED FROM A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

IN FISCAL 2014, WE EXPECT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS TO DECREASE FROM $698 MILLION TO $320 MILLION, INCLUDING

$146 MILLION

OF RECOGNITION OF NET ACTUARIAL LOSSES. THE DECREASE IN PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS IS DRIVEN BY A HIGHER ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS FOR FISCAL 2013 INCLUDED $458 MILLION OF RECOGNITION OF NET ACTUARIAL LOSSES. THE INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE ALSO RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN THE UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF OUR PLANS FROM $4.8 BILLION TO $1.9 BILLION AND A DECREASE IN UNRECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE TO $2.0 BILLION

($1.2 BILLION AFTER TAX) AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2013. IF OUR FUTURE INVESTMENT RETURNS DO NOT EXCEED OUR LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURNS AND/OR DISCOUNT RATES DO NOT INCREASE, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE UNRECOGNIZED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS A NET ACTUARIAL LOSS IN OUR INCOME STATEMENT OVER APPROXIMATELY THE NEXT 9 YEARS. SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF THE IMPACTS OF OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. DURING FISCAL 2013, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED

$505 MILLION

TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS INCLUDING DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS IN FISCAL 2014 TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $275 MILLION TO

$325 MILLION

. FINAL MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR FISCAL 2014 WILL BE DETERMINED BASED ON OUR JANUARY 1, 2014 FUNDING ACTUARIAL VALUATION, WHICH WILL BE AVAILABLE IN LATE FISCAL 2014. SEE “ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS” FOR THE IMPACT OF FACTORS AFFECTING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS.

IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

THE COMPANY HAS A FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT PROGRAM THAT IS INTENDED TO REDUCE EARNINGS FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES.  AS PART OF THIS PROGRAM, WE ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS DESIGNED TO HEDGE PROJECTED FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED OPERATING INCOME EXPOSURES FOR PERIODS THAT GENERALLY DO NOT EXCEED FOUR YEARS. BASED ON OUR CURRENT HEDGE PORTFOLIO AND OTHER POTENTIAL CURRENCY IMPACTS IN FISCAL 2014, WE CURRENTLY PROJECT AN ADVERSE IMPACT TO GROWTH IN SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME IN FISCAL 2014 OF APPROXIMATELY $200 MILLION, DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN THE JAPANESE YEN SINCE THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2013.

AFFILIATE FEE GROWTH OF 6% WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES OF 5% FROM HIGHER CONTRACTUAL RATES AND 1% FROM SUBSCRIBER GROWTH AT CABLE NETWORKS.

HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUES WERE DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $263 MILLION AT CABLE NETWORKS FROM $3,522 MILLION TO $3,785 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $162 MILLION AT BROADCASTING FROM $4,076 MILLION TO $3,914 MILLION. THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS REFLECTED AN INCREASE OF 6% DUE TO HIGHER RATES. THE DECREASE AT BROADCASTING REFLECTED DECREASES OF 7% DUE TO LOWER ABC RATINGS, AND 2% DUE TO LOWER LOCAL TELEVISION ADVERTISING DRIVEN BY LOWER POLITICAL ADVERTISING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF 5% DUE TO HIGHER ABC ADVERTISING RATES.

THE INCREASE IN OTHER REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PROGRAM SALES AT BROADCASTING DRIVEN BY

CASTLE, ONCE UPON A TIME

AND

REVENGE

, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER HOME ENTERTAINMENT REVENUES, PRIMARILY DUE TO

LOST

, AND LOWER DISNEY CHANNEL PROGRAM SALES.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS, WHICH INCREASED $231 MILLION FROM $8,760 MILLION TO $8,991 MILLION. AT CABLE NETWORKS, AN INCREASE IN PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS OF $359 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER SPORTS RIGHTS COSTS DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE INCREASES FOR COLLEGE SPORTS, NFL, MLB AND NBA PROGRAMMING AND EXPANDED RIGHTS FOR THE WIMBLEDON CHAMPIONSHIPS. AT BROADCASTING, PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS DECREASED $128 MILLION REFLECTING THE ABSENCE OF

THE OPRAH WINFREY SHOW

AT OUR LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS AND LOWER PROGRAM WRITE-OFFS AT ABC.

EQUITY IN THE INCOME OF INVESTEES

INCOME FROM EQUITY INVESTEES INCREASED TO $627 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR FROM $584 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE AT AETN PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER ADVERTISING AND AFFILIATE REVENUES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EQUITY LOSSES AT HULU, WHICH WERE DRIVEN BY HIGHER PROGRAMMING AND MARKETING COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER ADVERTISING AND SUBSCRIPTION REVENUES.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 8%, OR $473 MILLION, TO $6.6 BILLION. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES AT ESPN AND THE WORLDWIDE DISNEY CHANNELS AND HIGHER EQUITY INCOME FROM AETN.

PARKS AND RESORTS REVENUES INCREASED 10%, OR $1.1 BILLION, TO $12.9 BILLION DUE TO AN INCREASE OF $1.0 BILLION AT OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS AND AN INCREASE OF $86 MILLION AT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS.

REVENUE GROWTH OF 11% AT OUR DOMESTIC OPERATIONS REFLECTED A 5% INCREASE FROM HIGHER AVERAGE GUEST SPENDING AND A 5% INCREASE FROM VOLUME. INCREASED GUEST SPENDING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE TICKET PRICES, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SPENDING, AND DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATES. THE VOLUME INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER PASSENGER CRUISE DAYS FROM THE

DISNEY FANTASY

AND THE

DISNEY DREAM

, WHICH LAUNCHED IN MARCH 2012 AND JANUARY 2011, RESPECTIVELY, INCREASED ATTENDANCE AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS REFLECTING STRONG GROWTH AT DISNEYLAND RESORT, WHICH BENEFITED FROM THE OPENING OF CARS LAND AT DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE AND AN INCREASE IN OCCUPIED ROOM NIGHTS AT AULANI, OUR HOTEL AND VACATION CLUB RESORT IN HAWAII, WHICH OPENED IN AUGUST 2011.

REVENUE GROWTH OF 3% AT OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS REFLECTED A 3% INCREASE FROM HIGHER AVERAGE GUEST SPENDING, A 3% INCREASE FROM HIGHER ATTENDANCE AND A 3% INCREASE FROM HIGHER ROYALTY REVENUE FROM TOKYO DISNEY RESORT. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 4% DECREASE FROM THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO AND A DECREASE OF 1% FROM LOWER HOTEL OCCUPANCY AT DISNEYLAND PARIS. HIGHER GUEST SPENDING WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATES AND TICKET PRICES. HIGHER ROYALTY REVENUE FROM TOKYO DISNEY RESORT REFLECTED THE IMPACT FROM THE EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN JAPAN IN 2011.

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDE OPERATING LABOR, WHICH INCREASED BY $285 MILLION FROM $3,540 MILLION TO $3,825 MILLION AND COST OF SALES, WHICH INCREASED $96 MILLION FROM $1,198 MILLION TO $1,294 MILLION. HIGHER OPERATING LABOR WAS DRIVEN BY NEW GUEST OFFERINGS, LABOR COST INFLATION AND HIGHER EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS. THE INCREASE IN COST OF SALES WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER VOLUMES.  OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES, WHICH INCLUDE MAINTENANCE, UTILITIES, INVESTMENTS IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND PROPERTY TAXES, INCREASED DUE TO NEW GUEST OFFERINGS. SIGNIFICANT NEW GUEST OFFERINGS THAT DROVE INCREASED OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES AND OPERATING LABOR WERE THE

DISNEY FANTASY,

THE

DISNEY DREAM

AND THE EXPANSION OF DISNEY CALIFORNIA ADVENTURE. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A FAVORABLE IMPACT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION AS A RESULT OF THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR AGAINST THE EURO AND THE COLLECTION OF BUSINESS INTERRUPTION INSURANCE PROCEEDS RELATED TO THE EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN JAPAN.

THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS WAS DRIVEN BY MARKETING FOR RESORT EXPANSION AND NEW GUEST OFFERINGS AND LABOR AND OTHER COST INFLATION.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 22%, OR $349 MILLION, TO $1.9 BILLION DRIVEN BY INCREASES AT OUR DOMESTIC PARKS AND RESORTS, TOKYO DISNEY RESORT, DISNEY CRUISE LINE AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE AT DISNEYLAND PARIS.

LOWER HOME ENTERTAINMENT REVENUE REFLECTED A 12% DECREASE FROM A DECLINE IN UNIT SALES REFLECTING LOWER CATALOG SALES AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE CURRENT-YEAR TITLES. SIGNIFICANT TITLES IN THE CURRENT YEAR INCLUDED MARVEL’S

THE AVENGERS

AND

CARS 2

WHILE THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED

TOY STORY 3

AND

TANGLED.

THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A 2% INCREASE DUE TO HIGHER NET EFFECTIVE PRICING DOMESTICALLY, WHICH BENEFITED FROM A HIGHER BLU-RAY SALES MIX. NET EFFECTIVE PRICING IS THE WHOLESALE SELLING PRICE ADJUSTED FOR DISCOUNTS, SALES INCENTIVES AND RETURNS.

THE DECREASE IN TV/SVOD DISTRIBUTION AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER REVENUE SHARE FROM THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT RESULTING FROM THE PRIOR-YEAR PERFORMANCE OF CARS MERCHANDISE. TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION REVENUE WAS COMPARABLE TO THE PRIOR YEAR AS HIGHER SYNDICATION SALES IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WAS OFFSET BY LOWER SALES IN THE DOMESTIC PAY TELEVISION MARKET.

COST AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED A DECREASE OF $200 MILLION IN FILM COST AMORTIZATION, FROM $1,885 MILLION TO $1,685 MILLION, DRIVEN BY LOWER HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES VOLUME AND A LOWER AVERAGE PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION RATE FOR TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION SALES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FILM COST WRITE-DOWNS. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND COST OF GOODS SOLD, WHICH DECREASED $145 MILLION FROM $1,368 MILLION TO $1,223 MILLION DRIVEN BY A DECLINE IN HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES VOLUME AND FEWER THEATRICAL TITLES IN RELEASE.

THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MARKETING EXPENSES AT OUR THEATRICAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES DRIVEN BY FEWER MAJOR RELEASES IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 17% TO $722 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVED RESULTS AT OUR DOMESTIC THEATRICAL AND TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER FILM COST WRITE-DOWNS IN THE CURRENT YEAR.

THE RECLASSIFICATIONS REFLECT, IN PART, CHANGES TO OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE FOLLOWING LEADERSHIP CHANGES IN THE CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT IN FISCAL 2012.

REVENUES

THE 6% INCREASE IN LICENSING AND PUBLISHING REVENUE REFLECTED A DECREASED REVENUE SHARE WITH STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT DUE TO LOWER REVENUES FROM CARS MERCHANDISE, HIGHER PERFORMANCE OF SPIDER-MAN, MINNIE AND MICKEY AND AVENGERS MERCHANDISE AND HIGHER RECOGNITION OF MINIMUM GUARANTEES.

THE 7% INCREASE IN RETAIL AND OTHER REVENUE REFLECTED GROWTH AT OUR RETAIL BUSINESS DRIVEN BY NEW STORES IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE, INCREASED ONLINE SALES DUE TO PROMOTIONAL EVENTS, AND HIGHER COMPARABLE STORE SALES IN NORTH AMERICA. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER COMPARABLE STORE SALES IN EUROPE.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED AN INCREASE OF $26 MILLION IN COST OF GOODS SOLD FROM $567 MILLION TO $593 MILLION DRIVEN BY INCREASED SALES VOLUME AT OUR RETAIL BUSINESS. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE LABOR, OCCUPANCY AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND INCREASED BY 1% DUE TO HIGHER DISTRIBUTION COSTS DRIVEN BY HIGHER THIRD-PARTY ROYALTIES AND BY 1% DUE TO HIGHER OCCUPANCY AND LABOR COSTS.  THE INCREASE IN OCCUPANCY AND LABOR COSTS WAS DRIVEN BY THE EXPANSION OF THE ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNING CENTERS IN CHINA AND NEW RETAIL STORES IN NORTH AMERICA AND EUROPE.

THE INCREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER MARKETING AND PROMOTIONS EXPENSE.

THE DECREASE IN GAME SALES AND SUBSCRIPTIONS REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY DECREASES OF 29% FROM LOWER CONSOLE GAME UNIT SALES AND 8% FROM LOWER NET EFFECTIVE PRICING OF CONSOLE GAMES REFLECTING THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

LEGO PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN

,

CARS 2

AND

EPIC MICKEY

IN THE PRIOR-YEAR PERIOD. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN 11% INCREASE FROM HIGHER SOCIAL GAMES REVENUE REFLECTING IMPROVED PERFORMANCE FROM CURRENT PERIOD TITLES AND LOWER ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING IMPACTS.

HIGHER ADVERTISING AND OTHER REVENUE WAS DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE AT OUR MOBILE PHONE BUSINESS IN JAPAN.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OPERATING EXPENSES INCLUDED A $21 MILLION DECREASE IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS FROM $352 MILLION TO $331 MILLION DRIVEN BY DECREASED CONSOLE GAME DEVELOPMENT. OPERATING EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE COST OF SALES, WHICH DECREASED BY $71 MILLION FROM $323 MILLION TO $252 MILLION DRIVEN BY LOWER CONSOLE GAME SALES VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE AT SOCIAL GAMES ASSOCIATED WITH REVENUE GROWTH.

THE DECREASE IN SELLING, GENERAL, ADMINISTRATIVE AND OTHER COSTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MARKETING COSTS AT OUR CONSOLE GAMES BUSINESS DRIVEN BY FEWER RELEASES IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, LOWER ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING EXPENSES AT OUR SOCIAL GAMES BUSINESS, AND HIGHER COST ALLOCATIONS TO OTHER COMPANY BUSINESSES RELATED TO WEBSITE DESIGN AND MAINTENANCE AND ONLINE REVENUES.

SEGMENT OPERATING LOSS

SEGMENT OPERATING LOSS DECREASED 30% TO $216 MILLION DRIVEN BY IMPROVED RESULTS AT OUR SOCIAL GAMES AND ONLINE BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE AT OUR CONSOLE GAMES BUSINESS.

THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DECREASED 1.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS DUE TO THE IMPACT IN THE PRIOR YEAR OF THE GAIN ON THE SALE OF MIRAMAX, AN INCREASE IN EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN OPERATIONS SUBJECT TO TAX AT RATES LOWER THAN THE FEDERAL STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF A TAX RATE BENEFIT RECOGNIZED IN THE PRIOR YEAR FROM AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. THE BOOK VALUE OF MIRAMAX INCLUDED NON-DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL SUCH THAT THE TAXABLE GAIN ON THE SALE OF MIRAMAX RESULTED IN TAX EXPENSE THAT EXCEEDED THE BOOK GAIN RESULTING IN A 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE 2011 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. THE INCREASE IN FOREIGN EARNINGS SUBJECT TO TAX AT RATES LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY INCOME TAX RATE CAUSED A 0.3 PERCENTAGE POINT BENEFIT TO THE 2012 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.  THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IN 2011 RELATED TO ASSETS THAT HAD A TAX BASIS IN EXCESS OF BOOK VALUE RESULTING IN A TAX BENEFIT THAT EXCEEDED THE PRE-TAX IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RESULTING IN A 0.3 PERCENTAGE POINT BENEFIT TO THE 2011 TAX RATE.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2013 INCREASED 19% OR $1.5 BILLION TO $9.5 BILLION AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2012.  THE INCREASE REFLECTED HIGHER OPERATING CASH RECEIPTS FROM INCREASED REVENUES AT PARKS AND RESORTS, MEDIA NETWORKS AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS, TIMING OF COLLECTIONS AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT, AND LOWER PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS AND INTEREST PAYMENTS.  THE DECREASE IN INTEREST PAYMENTS WAS DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT PAYMENT OF ACCRUED INTEREST IN CONNECTION WITH THE PRIOR YEAR REFINANCING OF DISNEYLAND PARIS' BORROWINGS.  THESE CASH FLOW INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING CASH PAYMENTS AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT, MEDIA NETWORKS AND PARKS AND RESORTS AND THE PAYMENT RELATED TO THE CELADOR LITIGATION.  THE INCREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER FILM PRODUCTION SPENDING AND THE TIMING OF PARTICIPATION PAYMENTS, WHILE THE INCREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT MEDIA NETWORKS WAS DUE TO HIGHER TELEVISION PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION SPENDING.  THE INCREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT PARKS AND RESORTS WAS DUE TO HIGHER SPENDING ON NEW GUEST OFFERINGS AND LABOR COST INFLATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE ABSENCE OF A REPURCHASE OF VACATION CLUB MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES, WHICH OCCURRED IN THE PRIOR YEAR.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES FOR FISCAL 2012 INCREASED 14% OR $1.0 BILLION TO $8.0 BILLION AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2011. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET OPERATING CASH RECEIPTS DRIVEN BY HIGHER REVENUES AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS, MEDIA NETWORKS AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS BUSINESSES AND LOWER OPERATING CASH PAYMENTS AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT DRIVEN BY LOWER COST OF GOODS SOLD AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS. THESE CASH FLOW INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER OPERATING CASH PAYMENTS AT PARKS AND RESORTS, LOWER OPERATING CASH RECEIPTS AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT DRIVEN BY LOWER REVENUES, AND HIGHER INTEREST AND INCOME TAX PAYMENTS. THE INCREASE IN CASH PAYMENTS AT PARKS AND RESORTS WAS DRIVEN BY LABOR COST INFLATION AND COSTS FOR RESORT EXPANSION AND NEW GUEST OFFERINGS. THE INCREASE IN INTEREST PAYMENTS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PAYMENT OF PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED INTEREST ON DISNEYLAND PARIS BORROWINGS.

MYMAGIC+

, COMPARED TO THE CURRENT YEAR, WHICH INCLUDED HIGHER SPENDING RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT. THE INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AT PARKS AND RESORTS IN FISCAL 2012 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2011 WAS DRIVEN BY RESORT EXPANSION AND NEW GUEST OFFERINGS AT WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT AND CONSTRUCTION COSTS AT SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED EXPENDITURES AT DISNEYLAND RESORT.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH BALANCES, OTHER LIQUID ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE RESOURCES TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY’S OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL MARKETS CAN BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS CONTROL. SEE “ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS”. IN ADDITION TO MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE COMPANY’S BORROWING COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT- AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANY’S PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CERTAIN CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 28, 2013

, MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE’S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A2 AND P-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK; STANDARD & POOR’S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A AND A-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK; AND FITCH’S LONG- AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A AND F-1, RESPECTIVELY, WITH STABLE OUTLOOK. THE COMPANY’S BANK FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT, RELATING TO INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE COMPANY MET ON

SEPTEMBER 28, 2013

, BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN. THE COMPANY’S BANK FACILITIES ALSO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE CERTAIN ENTITIES, SUCH AS DISNEYLAND PARIS, HONG KONG DISNEYLAND RESORT AND SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT, FROM ANY REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS OR EVENTS OF DEFAULT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND COSTS

WE EXPENSE FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION, PARTICIPATION AND RESIDUAL COSTS OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIOD’S REVENUES TO THE ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL REVENUES (ULTIMATE REVENUES) FOR EACH PRODUCTION. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES DECREASES, AMORTIZATION OF FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED. CONVERSELY, IF OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES INCREASES, FILM AND TELEVISION COST AMORTIZATION MAY BE SLOWED. FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION SERIES, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM DELIVERY OF THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER.

WITH RESPECT TO FILMS INTENDED FOR THEATRICAL RELEASE, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES (AND THEREFORE AFFECTING FUTURE FILM COST AMORTIZATION AND/OR IMPAIRMENT) IS THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. REVENUES DERIVED FROM OTHER MARKETS SUBSEQUENT TO THE THEATRICAL RELEASE (E.G., THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT OR TELEVISION MARKETS) HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN HIGHLY CORRELATED WITH THE THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE. THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE VARIES PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE PUBLIC INTEREST AND DEMAND FOR A PARTICULAR FILM, THE POPULARITY OF COMPETING FILMS AT THE TIME OF RELEASE AND THE LEVEL OF MARKETING EFFORT. UPON A FILM’S RELEASE AND DETERMINATION OF THE THEATRICAL PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANY’S ESTIMATES OF REVENUES FROM SUCCEEDING WINDOWS AND MARKETS ARE REVISED BASED ON HISTORICAL RELATIONSHIPS AND AN ANALYSIS OF CURRENT MARKET TRENDS. THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING OUR ESTIMATE OF ULTIMATE REVENUES FOR RELEASED FILMS IS THE EXTENT OF HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES ACHIEVED. HOME ENTERTAINMENT SALES VARY BASED ON THE NUMBER AND QUALITY OF COMPETING HOME VIDEO PRODUCTS AS WELL AS THE MANNER IN WHICH RETAILERS MARKET AND PRICE OUR PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO TELEVISION SERIES OR OTHER TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS INTENDED FOR BROADCAST, THE MOST SENSITIVE FACTOR AFFECTING ESTIMATES OF ULTIMATE REVENUES IS THE PROGRAM’S RATING AND THE STRENGTH OF THE ADVERTISING MARKET. PROGRAM RATINGS, WHICH ARE AN INDICATION OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE, DIRECTLY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO GENERATE ADVERTISING REVENUES DURING THE AIRING OF THE PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, TELEVISION SERIES WITH GREATER MARKET ACCEPTANCE ARE MORE LIKELY TO GENERATE INCREMENTAL REVENUES THROUGH THE EVENTUAL SALE OF THE PROGRAM RIGHTS IN THE SYNDICATION, INTERNATIONAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKETS. ALTERNATIVELY, POOR RATINGS MAY RESULT IN A TELEVISION SERIES CANCELLATION, WHICH WOULD REQUIRE THE IMMEDIATE WRITE-OFF OF ANY UNAMORTIZED PRODUCTION COSTS. A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE ADVERTISING MARKET WOULD ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR ESTIMATES.

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF TELEVISION BROADCAST RIGHTS FOR ACQUIRED MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO BE AIRED OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE USEFUL LIFE, AS APPROPRIATE. AMORTIZATION OF THOSE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ASSETS BEING AMORTIZED ON A NUMBER OF AIRINGS BASIS MAY BE ACCELERATED IF WE REDUCE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS AND SLOWED IF WE INCREASE THE ESTIMATED FUTURE AIRINGS. THE NUMBER OF FUTURE AIRINGS OF A PARTICULAR PROGRAM IS IMPACTED PRIMARILY BY THE PROGRAM’S RATINGS IN PREVIOUS AIRINGS, EXPECTED ADVERTISING RATES AND AVAILABILITY AND QUALITY OF ALTERNATIVE PROGRAMMING. ACCORDINGLY, PLANNED USAGE IS REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND REVISED IF NECESSARY. WE AMORTIZE RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASONS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE OF EACH YEAR IN THE ARRANGEMENT. THE ESTIMATED VALUES OF EACH YEAR ARE BASED ON OUR PROJECTION OF REVENUES OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD, WHICH INCLUDE ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE REVENUE. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON APPROXIMATE EACH SEASON’S RELATIVE VALUE, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED CONTRACTUAL PAYMENT DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON. IF PLANNED USAGE PATTERNS OR ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUES BY YEAR WERE TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY, AMORTIZATION OF OUR SPORTS RIGHTS COSTS MAY BE ACCELERATED OR SLOWED.

COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO REGULAR RECOVERABILITY ASSESSMENTS, WHICH COMPARE THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES WITH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANY’S DAYPARTS ARE: PRIMETIME, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, NEWS AND SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL. INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMS ARE WRITTEN-OFF WHEN THERE ARE NO PLANS TO AIR OR SUBLICENSE THE PROGRAM. ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR PROJECTIONS, FILM, TELEVISION AND PROGRAMMING COST WRITE-DOWNS MAY BE REQUIRED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR ITS VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS THAT ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH BUSINESS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THESE REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES.

WE REDUCE HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND SOFTWARE PRODUCT REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED FUTURE RETURNS OF MERCHANDISE AND FOR CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND SALES INCENTIVES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL RETURN EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS OF CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD, WE MAY RECORD LESS REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS EXCEED THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT.

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONVERSELY, IF WE OVERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS FOR A PERIOD, WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS AND CONCESSIONS ARE LESS THAN ESTIMATED.

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. FOR NON-EXPIRING, MULTI-DAY TICKETS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE OVER A FIVE-YEAR TIME PERIOD BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE, WHICH IS DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS. IF ACTUAL USAGE IS DIFFERENT THAN OUR ESTIMATED USAGE, REVENUES MAY NOT BE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIODS THE RELATED SERVICES ARE RENDERED. IN ADDITION, A CHANGE IN USAGE PATTERNS WOULD IMPACT THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

THE COMPANY’S PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE CALCULATED USING A NUMBER OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY MEASUREMENT, WHICH WE EVALUATE ANNUALLY. OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE AND EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS RETIREMENT PATTERNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER AND RATE OF COMPENSATION INCREASE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS FOR BENEFITS AS A PRESENT VALUE ON THE MEASUREMENT DATE. A LOWER DISCOUNT RATE INCREASES THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND INCREASES PENSION EXPENSE. THE GUIDELINE FOR SETTING THIS RATE IS A HIGH-QUALITY LONG-TERM CORPORATE BOND RATE. WE INCREASED OUR DISCOUNT RATE TO

5.00%

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2013 FROM

3.85%

AT THE END OF FISCAL 2012 TO REFLECT MARKET INTEREST RATE CONDITIONS AT OUR SEPTEMBER 28, 2013 MEASUREMENT DATE. THIS INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WILL AFFECT NET PERIODIC PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE (BENEFIT EXPENSE) IN FISCAL 2014. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANY’S DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE TOTAL BENEFIT EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2014 BY

$204 MILLION

AND WOULD INCREASE THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT SEPTEMBER 28, 2013 BY

$1.9 BILLION

.  A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE TOTAL BENEFIT EXPENSE AND THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY

$192 MILLION

AND

$1.6 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED ASSET ALLOCATION AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON EACH PLAN ASSET CLASS. A LOWER EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE.  WE DECREASED OUR LONG-TERM EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS TO 7.50% AT THE END OF FISCAL 2013 FROM 7.75% AT THE END OF THE FISCAL 2012.  A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN THE LONG-TERM ASSET RETURN ASSUMPTION WOULD IMPACT FISCAL 2014 ANNUAL BENEFIT EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY

$90 MILLION.

SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND INVESTMENTS

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO TEST GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IF CURRENT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE, ON AN INTERIM BASIS. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. WE APPLY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES ARE SENSITIVE TO OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH AND MARGINS FOR THESE BUSINESSES. WE INCLUDE IN THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUE WE BELIEVE THE REPORTING UNIT WOULD RECEIVE IF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE REPORTING UNIT THAT IS BEING USED BY OTHER REPORTING UNITS WAS LICENSED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AT ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS THOSE INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS. WE BELIEVE OUR ESTIMATES OF FAIR VALUE ARE CONSISTENT WITH HOW A MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANT WOULD VALUE OUR REPORTING UNITS.

IN TIMES OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A GREATER DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY TESTS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (TRIGGERING EVENTS) INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ONCE A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST EMPLOYED IS BASED ON WHETHER THE INTENT IS TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR CONTINUED USE OR TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR SALE. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR ASSETS HELD FOR USE REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET GROUP AGAINST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP. AN ASSET GROUP IS ESTABLISHED BY IDENTIFYING THE LOWEST LEVEL OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY THE GROUP OF ASSETS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER ASSETS AND COULD INCLUDE ASSETS USED ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES OR SEGMENTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GROUP’S LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GROUP’S LONG-LIVED ASSETS. THE IMPAIRMENT IS ALLOCATED TO THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OF THE GROUP ON A PRO RATA BASIS USING THE RELATIVE CARRYING AMOUNTS, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH ASSET IS ABOVE ITS FAIR VALUE. FOR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE ASSET’S FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE. DETERMINING WHETHER A LONG-LIVED ASSET IS IMPAIRED REQUIRES VARIOUS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING WHETHER A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE ASSET GROUPS, ESTIMATES OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUES. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT ASSET GROUPS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY HAS COST AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES AS WELL AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF THESE INVESTMENTS, WE CONSIDER THESE FACTORS AS WELL AS THE FORECASTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE INVESTEES AND MARKET VALUES, WHERE AVAILABLE. IF THESE FORECASTS ARE NOT MET OR MARKET VALUES INDICATE AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN VALUE, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.

DURING FISCAL YEARS 2013, 2012 AND 2011, THE COMPANY TESTED ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS, INVESTMENTS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT, AND THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED WERE NOT MATERIAL.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

WE EVALUATE OUR ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND ESTIMATE COLLECTABILITY OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF HISTORICAL BAD DEBT EXPERIENCE IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. IN TIMES OF DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC TURMOIL, OUR ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS WITH RESPECT TO THE COLLECTABILITY OF OUR RECEIVABLES ARE SUBJECT TO GREATER UNCERTAINTY THAN IN MORE STABLE PERIODS. IF OUR ESTIMATE OF UNCOLLECTIBLE ACCOUNTS IS TOO LOW, COSTS AND EXPENSES MAY INCREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND IF IT IS TOO HIGH, COSTS AND EXPENSES MAY DECREASE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES OF THE PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LOSSES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE CLAIMS. THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND ARE BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE PROCEEDINGS. SEE NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.

INCOME TAX AUDITS

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. OUR DETERMINATIONS REGARDING THE RECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX BENEFITS ARE MADE IN CONSULTATION WITH OUTSIDE TAX AND LEGAL COUNSEL, WHERE APPROPRIATE, AND ARE BASED UPON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF OUR TAX POSITIONS IN CONSIDERATION OF APPLICABLE TAX STATUTES AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND PRECEDENTS AND UPON THE EXPECTED OUTCOME OF PROCEEDINGS (OR NEGOTIATIONS) WITH TAXING AND LEGAL AUTHORITIES. THE TAX BENEFITS ULTIMATELY REALIZED BY THE COMPANY MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE RECOGNIZED IN OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY’S DECISION TO SETTLE RATHER THAN LITIGATE A MATTER, RELEVANT LEGAL PRECEDENT RELATED TO SIMILAR MATTERS AND THE COMPANY’S SUCCESS IN SUPPORTING ITS FILING POSITIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995 PROVIDES A SAFE HARBOR FOR FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS MADE BY OR ON BEHALF OF THE COMPANY. WE MAY FROM TIME TO TIME MAKE WRITTEN OR ORAL STATEMENTS THAT ARE “FORWARD-LOOKING,” INCLUDING STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT AND OTHER FILINGS WITH THE SEC AND IN REPORTS TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS. SUCH STATEMENTS MAY, FOR EXAMPLE, EXPRESS EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS ABOUT FUTURE ACTIONS THAT WE MAY TAKE, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING OR STRATEGIC INITIATIVES, OR ABOUT DEVELOPMENTS BEYOND OUR CONTROL INCLUDING CHANGES IN DOMESTIC OR GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THESE STATEMENTS ARE MADE ON THE BASIS OF MANAGEMENT’S VIEWS AND ASSUMPTIONS AS OF THE TIME THE STATEMENTS ARE MADE AND WE UNDERTAKE NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE THESE STATEMENTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT OUR EXPECTATIONS WILL NECESSARILY COME TO PASS. SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING THESE EXPECTATIONS ARE SET FORTH UNDER ITEM 1A – RISK FACTORS OF THIS REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THE COMPANY’S EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER OVERALL BORROWING COSTS. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO THE COMPANY’S PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW IN ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES AND EXPENSES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE PURCHASE OR SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED, TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE PRINCIPAL FOREIGN CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES GENERALLY FOR PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED FOUR YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES. THE ECONOMIC OR POLITICAL CONDITIONS IN A COUNTRY COULD REDUCE OUR ABILITY TO HEDGE EXPOSURE TO CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COUNTRY OR OUR ABILITY TO REPATRIATE REVENUE FROM THE COUNTRY.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO COMMODITY FLUCTUATIONS ARE TO USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM COMMODITY PRICE CHANGES. THE AMOUNTS HEDGED USING COMMODITY SWAP CONTRACTS ARE BASED ON FORECASTED LEVELS OF CONSUMPTION OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES, SUCH AS FUEL OIL AND GASOLINE.

IT IS THE COMPANY’S POLICY TO ENTER INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY OTHER HEDGING TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

VALUE AT RISK (VAR)

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VAR MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES WERE MADE ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. VARIOUS MODELING TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED IN A VAR COMPUTATION. THE COMPANY’S COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND EQUITY PRICES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE INTERRELATIONSHIPS WERE DETERMINED BY OBSERVING INTEREST RATE, FOREIGN CURRENCY AND EQUITY MARKET CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING QUARTER FOR THE CALCULATION OF VAR AMOUNTS AT FISCAL YEAR END. THE MODEL INCLUDES ALL OF THE COMPANY’S DEBT AS WELL AS ALL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS, AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH CERTAIN OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE MODEL.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WILL BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS SUCH TERM IS DEFINED IN EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PREPARED FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL — INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN 1992. BASED ON OUR EVALUATION UNDER THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL — INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK,

MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2013.

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2013 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT, WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

IN OUR OPINION, THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, STATEMENTS OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY AND CASH FLOWS  PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT SEPTEMBER 28, 2013  AND SEPTEMBER 29, 2012, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED SEPTEMBER 28, 2013 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF SEPTEMBER 28, 2013, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN 1992 (COSO).  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS.  WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).  THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS.  OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION.  OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK.  OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.  ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE COMPANY INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS MAJORITY-OWNED AND CONTROLLED SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.

IN CERTAIN INSTANCES, THE ENTITY IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A RELATIONSHIP OR INVESTMENT MAY BE A VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE). A VIE IS CONSOLIDATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF THE COMPANY HAS THE POWER TO DIRECT ACTIVITIES THAT MOST SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE OF THE VIE AND HAS THE OBLIGATION TO ABSORB LOSSES OR THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE BENEFITS FROM THE VIE THAT COULD POTENTIALLY BE SIGNIFICANT TO THE VIE. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS LESS THAN A

50%

DIRECT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN DISNEYLAND PARIS, HKDL AND SHANGHAI DISNEY RESORT (COLLECTIVELY THE “INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS”), THEY ARE VIES, AND GIVEN THE NATURE OF THE COMPANY’S RELATIONSHIPS WITH THESE ENTITIES, WHICH INCLUDE MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS CONSOLIDATED THE INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS IN ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ALL OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING EITHER THE COST METHOD OR THE EQUITY METHOD.

THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS TO DETERMINE WHETHER A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW THE COST BASIS IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. IF THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COST BASIS OF THE INVESTMENT IS WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE.

TRANSLATION POLICY

THE LOCAL CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR THE INTERNATIONAL THEME PARKS, INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS OF THE DISNEY STORES, OUR UTV BUSINESSES IN INDIA, OUR ENGLISH LANGUAGE LEARNING CENTERS IN CHINA AND CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS.

FOR U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY LOCATIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE REMEASURED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR NON-MONETARY BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING EACH PERIOD, EXCEPT FOR THOSE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE NON-MONETARY BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS, WHICH ARE REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT ARE INCLUDED IN INCOME.

TEN

YEARS FROM THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR TELEVISION SERIES, ULTIMATE REVENUES INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN

THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE UNAMORTIZED COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS EXCEED THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES IS WRITTEN OFF. FILM DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN ABANDONED OR HAVE NOT BEEN SET FOR PRODUCTION WITHIN

RIGHTS COSTS FOR MULTI-YEAR SPORTS PROGRAMMING ARRANGEMENTS ARE AMORTIZED DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASONS BASED ON THE ESTIMATED RELATIVE VALUE OF EACH YEAR IN THE ARRANGEMENT. THE ESTIMATED VALUES OF EACH YEAR ARE BASED ON OUR PROJECTIONS OF REVENUES OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD, WHICH INCLUDE ADVERTISING REVENUE AND AN ALLOCATION OF AFFILIATE REVENUE. IF THE ANNUAL CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS RELATED TO EACH SEASON APPROXIMATE EACH SEASON’S RELATIVE VALUE, WE EXPENSE THE RELATED CONTRACTUAL PAYMENTS DURING THE APPLICABLE SEASON.

GOODWILL, OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LONG-LIVED ASSETS

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO TEST GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND IF CURRENT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES REQUIRE, ON AN INTERIM BASIS. GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING UNITS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY AN OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. THE COMPANY COMPARES THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GOODWILL.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND AS APPROPRIATE. WE APPLY WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF OUR REPORTING UNITS. WE INCLUDE IN THE PROJECTED CASH FLOWS AN ESTIMATE OF THE REVENUE WE BELIEVE THE REPORTING UNIT WOULD RECEIVE IF THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY THE REPORTING UNIT THAT IS BEING USED BY OTHER REPORTING UNITS WAS LICENSED TO AN UNRELATED THIRD PARTY AT ITS FAIR MARKET VALUE. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY THE SAME AS THOSE INCLUDED IN SEGMENT OPERATING RESULTS.

IN TIMES OF ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY, THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO A GREATER DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER, AND WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO RECORD IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO COMPARE THE FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS TO THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES OF OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OR APPRAISED VALUES, AS APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY TESTS LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES (TRIGGERING EVENTS) INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. ONCE A TRIGGERING EVENT HAS OCCURRED, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST EMPLOYED IS BASED ON WHETHER THE INTENT IS TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR CONTINUED USE OR TO HOLD THE ASSET FOR SALE. THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR ASSETS HELD FOR USE REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO BE GENERATED OVER THE USEFUL LIFE OF AN ASSET GROUP AGAINST THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP. AN ASSET GROUP IS ESTABLISHED BY IDENTIFYING THE

69

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOWEST LEVEL OF CASH FLOWS GENERATED BY A GROUP OF ASSETS THAT ARE LARGELY INDEPENDENT OF THE CASH FLOWS OF OTHER ASSETS AND COULD INCLUDE ASSETS USED ACROSS MULTIPLE BUSINESSES OR SEGMENTS. IF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSET GROUP EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, AN IMPAIRMENT WOULD BE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GROUP’S LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE GROUP’S LONG-LIVED ASSETS. THE IMPAIRMENT IS ALLOCATED TO THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OF THE GROUP ON A PRO RATA BASIS USING THE RELATIVE CARRYING AMOUNT, BUT ONLY TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE OF EACH ASSET IS ABOVE ITS FAIR VALUE. FOR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE, TO THE EXTENT THE CARRYING VALUE IS GREATER THAN THE ASSET’S FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED FOR THE DIFFERENCE.

DURING FISCAL YEARS 2013, 2012 AND 2011, THE COMPANY TESTED ITS GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT, AND THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RECORDED WERE NOT MATERIAL.

AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE GENERALLY AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER PERIODS UP TO

40 YEARS

. THE COSTS TO PERIODICALLY RENEW OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THERE ARE CURRENTLY NO LEGAL, COMPETITIVE, ECONOMIC OR OTHER FACTORS THAT MATERIALLY LIMIT THE USEFUL LIFE OF OUR FCC LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS ITS AGGREGATE ANNUAL AMORTIZATION EXPENSE FOR EXISTING AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2014 THROUGH 2018 TO BE AS FOLLOWS.

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO MANAGE ITS EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES.

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS AS WELL AS ITS RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR UNDERTAKING VARIOUS HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THERE ARE

TWO

TYPES OF DERIVATIVES INTO WHICH THE COMPANY ENTERS: HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AND HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE. HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED ASSET, LIABILITY, OR A FIRM COMMITMENT. HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE A FORECASTED TRANSACTION (E.G. FORECASTED REVENUE) OR THE VARIABILITY OF CASH FLOWS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED, RELATED TO A RECOGNIZED LIABILITY OR ASSET (E.G. FLOATING RATE DEBT).

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES AND ASSIGNS THE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFIC ASSETS OR SPECIFIC LIABILITIES. WHEN HEDGED ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE SOLD OR EXTINGUISHED OR THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED OCCUR OR ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO OCCUR, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

OPTION PREMIUMS AND UNREALIZED GAINS ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS ASSETS. UNREALIZED LOSSES ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO BE PAID UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN LIABILITIES. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT CONSISTENT WITH THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. THE COMPANY ACCRUES THE DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS AS INTEREST RATES CHANGE AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE LIVES OF THE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE TERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE SWAP AGREEMENTS, PRIOR TO THEIR ORIGINAL MATURITY, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTIONS.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THESE CONTRACTS ARE INTENDED TO OFFSET CERTAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURES OF THE COMPANY AND ARE CARRIED AT MARKET VALUE WITH ANY CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGING ACTIVITIES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (SEE NOTES 8 AND 16).

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCOME TAXES

DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED WITH RESPECT TO TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IN THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF ITEMS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES AND FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. WHERE, BASED ON THE WEIGHT OF ALL AVAILABLE EVIDENCE, IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT SOME AMOUNT OF RECORDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED, A VALUATION ALLOWANCE IS ESTABLISHED FOR THE AMOUNT THAT, IN MANAGEMENT’S JUDGMENT, IS SUFFICIENT TO REDUCE THE DEFERRED TAX ASSET TO AN AMOUNT THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE REALIZED.

A TAX POSITION MUST MEET A MINIMUM PROBABILITY THRESHOLD BEFORE A FINANCIAL STATEMENT BENEFIT IS RECOGNIZED. THE MINIMUM THRESHOLD IS DEFINED AS A TAX POSITION THAT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT TO BE SUSTAINED UPON EXAMINATION BY THE APPLICABLE TAXING AUTHORITY, INCLUDING RESOLUTION OF ANY RELATED APPEALS OR LITIGATION PROCESSES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFIT TO BE RECOGNIZED IS MEASURED AS THE LARGEST AMOUNT OF BENEFIT THAT IS GREATER THAN

FIFTY PERCENT

LIKELY OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT.

EARNINGS PER SHARE

THE COMPANY PRESENTS BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AMOUNTS. BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED BY DIVIDING NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO DISNEY BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EPS IS BASED UPON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR, WHICH IS CALCULATED USING THE TREASURY-STOCK METHOD FOR EQUITY-BASED AWARDS (AWARDS). COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE COMPUTATION IN PERIODS FOR WHICH THEY HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE EFFECT. STOCK OPTIONS FOR WHICH THE EXERCISE PRICE EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OVER THE PERIOD ARE ANTI-DILUTIVE AND, ACCORDINGLY, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION.

A RECONCILIATION OF THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES OUTSTANDING AND THE NUMBER OF AWARDS EXCLUDED FROM THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION, AS THEY WERE ANTI-DILUTIVE, ARE AS FOLLOWS.

HULU

ON OCTOBER 5, 2012, HULU LLC (HULU) REDEEMED PROVIDENCE EQUITY PARTNERS'

10%

EQUITY INTEREST IN HULU FOR

$200 MILLION

, INCREASING THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN HULU FROM

29%

33%

, AND WILL CONTINUE TO GUARANTEE ITS SHARE OF HULU'S

$338 MILLION

TERM LOAN.

42.1%

BY THE COMPANY,

42.1%

BY THE HEARST CORPORATION (HEARST) AND

15.8%

BY NBCUNIVERSAL UNTIL AUGUST 2012 WHEN AETN REDEEMED NBCUNIVERSAL’S EQUITY INTEREST FOR APPROXIMATELY

50%

. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS INTEREST IN AETN AS AN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT.

UTV

PURSUANT TO A DELISTING OFFER PROCESS GOVERNED BY INDIAN LAW, ON FEBRUARY 2, 2012, THE COMPANY PAID

$377 MILLION

TO PURCHASE PUBLICLY HELD SHARES AND ALL OF THE SHARES HELD BY THE FOUNDER OF UTV SOFTWARE COMMUNICATIONS LIMITED (UTV), A MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT COMPANY HEADQUARTERED IN INDIA. THE COMPANY ALSO ASSUMED APPROXIMATELY

$300 MILLION

OF UTV’S BORROWINGS. THE PURCHASE INCREASED THE COMPANY’S OWNERSHIP INTEREST TO

93%

FROM

50%

. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS ACCOUNTING FOR UTV FROM AN EQUITY INVESTMENT TO A CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY. THE ACQUISITION OF UTV SUPPORTS THE COMPANY’S STRATEGIC PRIORITY OF INCREASING ITS BRAND PRESENCE AND REACH IN KEY INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

UPON CONSOLIDATION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A NON-CASH GAIN OF

$184 MILLION

$116 MILLION

AFTER TAX) AS A RESULT OF ADJUSTING THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE COMPANY’S

50%

EQUITY INVESTMENT TO ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF

$405 MILLION

. THE GAIN WAS RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET IN THE FISCAL 2012 CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE FAIR VALUE WAS DETERMINED BASED ON THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL VALUATION OF THE UTV BUSINESS USING AN INCOME APPROACH (DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL), WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES PROVIDES THE MOST APPROPRIATE INDICATOR OF FAIR VALUE.

THE COMPANY'S ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED RESULTED IN THE MAJORITY OF THE PURCHASE PRICE BEING ALLOCATED TO GOODWILL, WHICH IS NOT DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE GOODWILL REFLECTS THE SYNERGIES AND INCREASED INDIAN MARKET PENETRATION EXPECTED FROM COMBINING THE OPERATIONS OF UTV AND THE COMPANY.

6%

INTEREST FOR

$74 MILLION

, WHICH HAS INCREASED THE COMPANY'S OWNERSHIP TO OVER

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PLAN ASSETS

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY’S DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE MANAGED ON A COMMINGLED BASIS IN A THIRD-PARTY MASTER TRUST. THE INVESTMENT POLICY AND ALLOCATION OF THE ASSETS IN THE MASTER TRUST WERE APPROVED BY THE COMPANY’S INVESTMENT AND ADMINISTRATIVE COMMITTEE, WHICH HAS OVERSIGHT RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE COMPANY’S RETIREMENT PLANS. THE INVESTMENT POLICY RANGES FOR THE MAJOR ASSET CLASSES ARE AS FOLLOWS.

THE PRIMARY INVESTMENT OBJECTIVE FOR THE ASSETS WITHIN THE MASTER TRUST IS THE PRUDENT AND COST EFFECTIVE MANAGEMENT OF ASSETS TO SATISFY BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS. FINANCIAL RISKS ARE MANAGED THROUGH DIVERSIFICATION OF PLAN ASSETS, SELECTION OF INVESTMENT MANAGERS AND THROUGH THE INVESTMENT GUIDELINES INCORPORATED IN INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS. ASSETS ARE MONITORED TO ENSURE THAT INVESTMENT RETURNS ARE COMMENSURATE WITH RISKS TAKEN.

THE LONG-TERM ASSET ALLOCATION POLICY FOR THE MASTER TRUST WAS ESTABLISHED TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION A VARIETY OF FACTORS THAT INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE AVERAGE AGE OF PARTICIPANTS, THE NUMBER OF RETIREES, THE DURATION OF LIABILITIES AND THE EXPECTED PAYOUT RATIO. LIQUIDITY NEEDS OF THE MASTER TRUST ARE GENERALLY MANAGED USING CASH GENERATED BY INVESTMENTS OR BY LIQUIDATING SECURITIES.

ASSETS ARE GENERALLY MANAGED BY EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGERS, AND WE HAVE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT AGREEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO SECURITIES IN THE MASTER TRUST. THESE AGREEMENTS INCLUDE ACCOUNT GUIDELINES THAT ESTABLISH PERMITTED SECURITIES AND RISK CONTROLS COMMENSURATE WITH THE ACCOUNT’S INVESTMENT STRATEGY. SOME AGREEMENTS PERMIT THE USE OF DERIVATIVE SECURITIES (FUTURES, OPTIONS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS) THAT ENABLE INVESTMENT MANAGERS TO ENHANCE RETURNS AND MANAGE EXPOSURES WITHIN THEIR ACCOUNTS. INVESTMENT MANAGERS ARE PROHIBITED FROM USING DERIVATIVES TO LEVERAGE RETURNS.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF PLAN ASSETS

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED FOR SELLING AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AND IS CLASSIFIED IN THE FOLLOWING THREE CATEGORIES.

LEVEL 1 – QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS

LEVEL 2 – QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS; QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE; AND MODEL-DERIVED VALUATIONS IN WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS AND SIGNIFICANT VALUE DRIVERS ARE OBSERVABLE IN ACTIVE MARKETS

LEVEL 3 – VALUATIONS DERIVED FROM VALUATION TECHNIQUES IN WHICH ONE OR MORE SIGNIFICANT INPUTS OR SIGNIFICANT VALUE DRIVERS ARE UNOBSERVABLE

85

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED FOR ASSETS REPORTED AT FAIR VALUE. THERE HAVE BEEN NO CHANGES IN THE METHODOLOGIES USED AT

SEPTEMBER 28, 2013

AND

SEPTEMBER 29, 2012.

LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED BASED ON OBSERVABLE MARKET PRICES ON THE LAST TRADING DAY OF THE YEAR. INVESTMENTS IN COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCKS ARE VALUED BASED ON THE SECURITIES EXCHANGE-LISTED PRICE OR A BROKER’S QUOTE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET. INVESTMENTS IN U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES ARE VALUED BASED ON A BROKER’S QUOTE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET.

LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN GOVERNMENT AND FEDERAL AGENCY BONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (MBS), ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND CORPORATE BONDS ARE VALUED USING A BROKER’S QUOTE IN A NON-ACTIVE MARKET OR AN EVALUATED PRICE BASED ON A COMPILATION OF REPORTED MARKET INFORMATION, SUCH AS BENCHMARK YIELD CURVES, CREDIT SPREADS AND ESTIMATED DEFAULT RATES. DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE VALUED BASED ON MODELS THAT INCORPORATE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES, SUCH AS INTEREST RATES. SHARES IN MONEY MARKET AND MUTUAL FUNDS ARE VALUED AT THE NET ASSET VALUE OF THE SHARES HELD BY THE PLAN AT YEAR-END BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS.

LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS CONSIST OF INVESTMENTS IN LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS, WHICH ARE VALUED BASED ON THE MASTER TRUST'S PRO-RATA SHARE OF THE PARTNERSHIPS' UNDERLYING NET INVESTMENT HOLDINGS AS REPORTED IN THE PARTNERSHIPS' FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE INVESTMENTS HELD BY THE PARTNERSHIPS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE BY THE PARTNERSHIPS AND THE PARTNERSHIPS' FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE GENERALLY AUDITED ANNUALLY. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS ARE ESTIMATED USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (E.G., DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS OR RELATIVE VALUATION METHODS THAT INCORPORATE COMPARABLE MARKET INFORMATION SUCH AS EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW MULTIPLES FROM SIMILAR PUBLICLY TRADED COMPANIES OR REAL ESTATE PROPERTIES).

THE COMPANY’S DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS ARE SUMMARIZED BY LEVEL IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES.

ASSUMPTIONS

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS THE DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE, HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST AS WELL AS THE RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

DISCOUNT RATE

— THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE FOR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS REFLECTS THE MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANY’S DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

— THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM RETURNS ON AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTING OF A MIXTURE OF EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS. WHEN DETERMINING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY CONSIDERS LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON THE ASSET CLASSES (BOTH HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED) IN WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE PENSION FUNDS TO BE INVESTED. THE FOLLOWING LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN BY ASSET CLASS WERE CONSIDERED IN SETTING THE LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION.

7.25%

MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION PLANS

THE COMPANY PARTICIPATES IN A NUMBER OF MULTIEMPLOYER PENSION PLANS UNDER UNION AND INDUSTRY-WIDE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS THAT COVER OUR UNION-REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES AND EXPENSES ITS CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PLANS AS INCURRED. THESE PLANS GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR RETIREMENT, DEATH AND/OR TERMINATION BENEFITS FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES WITHIN THE APPLICABLE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNITS, BASED ON SPECIFIC ELIGIBILITY/PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS, VESTING PERIODS AND BENEFIT FORMULAS. THE RISKS OF PARTICIPATING IN THESE MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS ARE DIFFERENT FROM SINGLE-EMPLOYER PLANS.  FOR EXAMPLE.

•

ASSETS CONTRIBUTED TO THE MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN BY ONE EMPLOYER MAY BE USED TO PROVIDE BENEFITS TO EMPLOYEES OF OTHER PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS.

•

IF A PARTICIPATING EMPLOYER STOPS CONTRIBUTING TO THE MULTIEMPLOYER PLAN, THE UNFUNDED OBLIGATIONS OF THE PLAN MAY BECOME THE OBLIGATION OF THE REMAINING PARTICIPATING EMPLOYERS.

•

IF THE COMPANY CHOOSES TO STOP PARTICIPATING IN THESE MULTIEMPLOYER PLANS, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO PAY THOSE PLANS AN AMOUNT BASED ON THE UNDERFUNDED STATUS OF THE PLAN, REFERRED TO AS A WITHDRAWAL LIABILITY.

THE COMPANY ALSO PARTICIPATES IN SEVERAL MULTIEMPLOYER HEALTH AND WELFARE PLANS THAT COVER BOTH ACTIVE AND RETIRED EMPLOYEES. HEALTH CARE BENEFITS ARE PROVIDED TO PARTICIPANTS WHO MEET CERTAIN ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS UNDER THE APPLICABLE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING UNIT.

FULLY AFTER THREE YEARS, SUBJECT TO ACHIEVING MARKET AND/OR PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS

STARTING MARCH 2009 FOR OUR PRIMARY PLAN, EACH SHARE GRANTED SUBJECT TO A STOCK OPTION AWARD REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE BY ONE SHARE WHILE EACH SHARE GRANTED SUBJECT TO A RSU AWARD REDUCES THE NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE BY TWO SHARES. IN MARCH 2011, SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY APPROVED THE 2011 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, WHICH INCREASED THE NUMBER OF SHARES AUTHORIZED TO BE AWARDED AS GRANTS BY

64 MILLION

SHARES. IN MARCH 2012, SHAREHOLDERS OF THE COMPANY APPROVED AN AMENDMENT TO THE 2011 STOCK INCENTIVE PLAN, WHICH INCREASED THE NUMBER OF SHARES AUTHORIZED TO BE AWARDED AS GRANTS BY AN INCREMENTAL

15 MILLION

SHARES. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 28, 2013

, THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE (ASSUMING ALL THE AWARDS ARE IN THE FORM OF STOCK OPTIONS) WAS APPROXIMATELY

113 MILLION

SHARES AND THE NUMBER AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE ASSUMING ALL AWARDS ARE IN THE FORM OF RSUS WAS APPROXIMATELY

57 MILLION

SHARES. THE COMPANY SATISFIES STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF RSUS WITH NEWLY ISSUED SHARES. STOCK OPTIONS AND RSUS ARE GENERALLY FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES WHO TERMINATE PRIOR TO VESTING.

EACH YEAR, GENERALLY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER, THE COMPANY AWARDS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO A BROAD-BASED GROUP OF MANAGEMENT AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL. THE FAIR VALUE OF OPTIONS IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL TAKES INTO ACCOUNT VARIABLES SUCH AS VOLATILITY, DIVIDEND YIELD AND THE RISK-FREE INTEREST RATE. THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ALSO CONSIDERS THE EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE (THE MULTIPLE OF EXERCISE PRICE TO GRANT PRICE AT WHICH EXERCISES ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR ON AVERAGE) AND THE TERMINATION RATE (THE PROBABILITY OF A VESTED OPTION BEING CANCELLED DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF THE OPTION HOLDER) IN COMPUTING THE VALUE OF THE OPTION.

ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL FAIR VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS NOT ADJUSTED AFTER THE GRANT DATE, CHANGES IN THE COMPANY’S ASSUMPTIONS MAY CHANGE THE VALUE OF, AND THEREFORE THE EXPENSE RELATED TO, FUTURE STOCK OPTION GRANTS. THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT CAUSE THE GREATEST VARIATION IN FAIR VALUE IN THE BINOMIAL VALUATION MODEL ARE THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE. INCREASES OR DECREASES IN EITHER THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OR EXPECTED EXERCISE MULTIPLE WILL CAUSE THE BINOMIAL OPTION VALUE TO INCREASE OR DECREASE, RESPECTIVELY.

THE VOLATILITY ASSUMPTION CONSIDERS BOTH HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED VOLATILITY AND MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE COMPANY’S PERFORMANCE AS WELL AS CHANGES IN ECONOMIC AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS AND STOCK OPTIONS IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD OF THE AWARD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS IS BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES UNDERLYING THE AWARDS ON THE GRANT DATE. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR PERFORMANCE RSUS REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED PROBABILITY THAT THE MARKET AND/OR PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS WILL BE MET. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 2010, EQUITY-BASED AWARD GRANTS GENERALLY PROVIDE CONTINUED VESTING, IN THE EVENT OF

LONG-TERM RECEIVABLES AND THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES

THE COMPANY HAS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES GREATER THAN ONE YEAR RELATED TO THE SALE OF TELEVISION PROGRAM RIGHTS WITHIN THE MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT AND VACATION OWNERSHIP UNITS WITHIN THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT. ALLOWANCES FOR CREDIT LOSSES ARE ESTABLISHED AGAINST THESE RECEIVABLES AS NECESSARY.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES RELATED TO RECEIVABLES FROM THE SALE OF TELEVISION PROGRAMS BASED UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF INDIVIDUAL COMPANIES WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. THE BALANCE OF TELEVISION PROGRAM SALES RECEIVABLES RECORDED IN OTHER NON-CURRENT ASSETS, NET OF AN IMMATERIAL ALLOWANCE FOR CREDIT LOSSES, WAS

THE COMPANY HAS A MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT BY COUNTERPARTY FOR ITS DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. CONTRACTS IN A LIABILITY POSITION TOTALING

$171 MILLION

AND

$153 MILLION

HAVE BEEN NETTED AGAINST CONTRACTS IN AN ASSET POSITION IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS AT

SEPTEMBER 28, 2013

AND

SEPTEMBER 29, 2012

, RESPECTIVELY.

THE FAIR VALUES OF LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES ARE PRIMARILY DETERMINED BY INTERNAL DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS THAT USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS SUCH AS INTEREST RATES, YIELD CURVES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK, WHICH IS MITIGATED BY MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS AND COLLATERAL POSTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH CERTAIN COUNTERPARTIES, DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON DERIVATIVE FAIR VALUE ESTIMATES.

LEVEL 2 BORROWINGS, WHICH INCLUDE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND U.S. MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, ARE VALUED BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS.

LEVEL 3 BORROWINGS, WHICH INCLUDE HKDL BORROWINGS AND OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS, ARE GENERALLY VALUED BASED ON HISTORICAL MARKET TRANSACTIONS, PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES AND THE COMPANY'S CURRENT BORROWING COST AND CREDIT RISK.

THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ALSO INCLUDE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNT PAYABLE. THE CARRYING VALUES OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS APPROXIMATE THE FAIR VALUES.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS ASSETS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NON-RECURRING BASIS WHEN THE ESTIMATED FUTURE CASH FLOWS PROVIDE INDICATORS THAT THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED. DURING FISCAL YEARS

2013

AND

2012

, THE COMPANY RECORDED FILM PRODUCTION COST IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF

$100 MILLION

AND

$121 MILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. AT

SEPTEMBER 28, 2013

, THE AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUE OF THE FILMS FOR WHICH WE PREPARED THE FAIR VALUE ANALYSES IN FISCAL 2013 WAS

$142 MILLION

.  AT

SEPTEMBER 29, 2012

, THE AGGREGATE CARRYING VALUE OF THE FILMS FOR WHICH WE PREPARED THE FAIR VALUE ANALYSES IN FISCAL 2012 WAS

$172 MILLION

.  THESE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE REPORTED IN “COSTS AND EXPENSES” IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE FILM IMPAIRMENT CHARGES REFLECTED THE EXCESS OF THE UNAMORTIZED COST OF THE IMPAIRED FILMS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS A LEVEL 3 VALUATION TECHNIQUE.

TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

THROUGH DECEMBER 4, 2008, THE COMPANY SOLD MORTGAGE RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM SALES OF ITS VACATION OWNERSHIP UNITS UNDER A FACILITY THAT EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 4, 2008 AND WAS NOT RENEWED. IN FISCAL 2012, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED THESE RECEIVABLES FOR THE OUTSTANDING PRINCIPAL BALANCE OF

$191 MILLION

, WHICH APPROXIMATED FAIR VALUE.

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

THE COMPANY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS WITH, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE COUNTERPARTIES TO ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ON AN ONGOING BASIS AND DOES NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTIES.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THAT IT WOULD REALIZE A MATERIAL LOSS, BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AS OF

SEPTEMBER 28, 2013

, IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY SINGLE DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTY. THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS ONLY WITH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF A- OR BETTER. THE COMPANY’S CURRENT POLICY REGARDING AGREEMENTS WITH DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES IS GENERALLY TO REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT CREDIT RATINGS FALL BELOW A- OR IN THE EVENT AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED LIMITS AS DEFINED BY CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY LIMITS THE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE MATERIAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENT BALANCES WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT HAVE A CREDIT RATING OF LESS THAN INVESTMENT GRADE. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 28, 2013

, THE COMPANY’S BALANCES WITH INDIVIDUAL FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT EXCEEDED 10% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS WERE

26%

OF TOTAL CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS COMPARED TO

44%

AS OF

SEPTEMBER 29, 2012.

THE COMPANY’S TRADE RECEIVABLES AND FINANCIAL INVESTMENTS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK AT

SEPTEMBER 28, 2013

DUE TO THE WIDE VARIETY OF CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS INTO WHICH THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS ARE SOLD, THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS AND THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE COMPANY’S PORTFOLIO AMONG ISSUERS.

16

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS EXPOSURE TO VARIOUS RISKS RELATING TO ITS ONGOING BUSINESS OPERATIONS ACCORDING TO A RISK MANAGEMENT POLICY. THE PRIMARY RISKS MANAGED WITH DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTEREST RATE RISK AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK.

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS BORROWING ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY’S OBJECTIVE IS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND ON THE MARKET VALUE OF ITS BORROWINGS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ITS POLICY, THE COMPANY TARGETS ITS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGE. THE COMPANY TYPICALLY USES PAY-FLOATING AND PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO FACILITATE ITS INTEREST RATE MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES.

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES PAY-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS EFFECTIVELY CONVERTING FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS TO VARIABLE RATE BORROWINGS INDEXED TO LIBOR. AS OF

SEPTEMBER 28, 2013

AND

SEPTEMBER 29, 2012

, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY’S PAY-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS

$5.6 BILLION

AND

$3.1 BILLION

, RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO FAIR VALUE HEDGES INCLUDED IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

THE COMPANY MAY DESIGNATE PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF INTEREST PAYMENTS ON FLOATING-RATE BORROWINGS. PAY-FIXED SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FLOATING RATE BORROWINGS TO FIXED-RATE BORROWINGS. THE UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES FROM THESE CASH FLOW HEDGES ARE DEFERRED IN AOCI AND RECOGNIZED IN INTEREST EXPENSE AS THE INTEREST PAYMENTS OCCUR. THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF INTEREST PAYMENTS AT
