COMPETITION

THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK, DISNEY CHANNEL, ESPN,

ABC FAMILY CHANNEL AND OUR OTHER BROADCAST AND CABLE/SATELLITE

SERVICES COMPETE FOR VIEWERS PRIMARILY WITH OTHER TELEVISION

NETWORKS, INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATIONS AND OTHER VIDEO MEDIA,

SUCH AS CABLE AND SATELLITE TELEVISION PROGRAMMING SERVICES,

VIDEOCASSETTES, DVDS, VIDEO GAMES AND THE INTERNET. IN THE SALE

OF ADVERTISING TIME, THE BROADCASTING OPERATIONS COMPETE WITH

OTHER TELEVISION NETWORKS, INDEPENDENT TELEVISION STATIONS,

SUPPLIERS OF CABLE/SATELLITE SERVICES AND OTHER ADVERTISING

MEDIA SUCH AS NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, BILLBOARDS AND THE

INTERNET. THE ABC RADIO NETWORKS LIKEWISE COMPETE WITH OTHER

RADIO NETWORKS AND RADIO PROGRAMMING SERVICES, INDEPENDENT RADIO

STATIONS AND OTHER ADVERTISING MEDIA.

THE COMPANYS TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS

COMPETE WITH OTHER TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS, CABLE AND

SATELLITE PROGRAMMING SERVICES, VIDEOCASSETTES, DVDS AND OTHER

ADVERTISING MEDIA SUCH AS NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES, BILLBOARDS AND

THE INTERNET. COMPETITION OCCURS PRIMARILY IN INDIVIDUAL MARKET

AREAS. A TELEVISION OR RADIO STATION IN ONE MARKET GENERALLY

DOES NOT COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH STATIONS IN OTHER MARKET AREAS.

THE GROWTH IN THE CABLE/SATELLITE INDUSTRYS

SHARE OF VIEWERS HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES

FOR ADVERTISING REVENUES. THE COMPANYS CABLE/SATELLITE

NETWORKS ALSO FACE COMPETITION FOR CARRIAGE BY CABLE AND

SATELLITE SERVICE OPERATORS AND DISTRIBUTORS. THE COMPANYS

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS WITH CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS ARE

RENEWED OR RENEGOTIATED FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE

OF BUSINESS. CONSOLIDATION AND OTHER MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE

CABLE AND SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY AND OTHER FACTORS MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO OBTAIN AND

MAINTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF ITS VARIOUS

CABLE AND SATELLITE PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS FAVORABLE

AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE.

THE COMPANYS MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ALSO

COMPETES FOR THE ACQUISITION OF SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING.

THE MARKET FOR PROGRAMMING IS VERY COMPETITIVE, PARTICULARLY FOR

SPORTS PROGRAMMING. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS SPORTS RIGHTS

AGREEMENTS WITH THE NFL, NBA, AND MLB, AS WELL AS FOR OTHER

SPORTING EVENTS, INCLUDING THE COLLEGE FOOTBALL BOWL

CHAMPIONSHIP SERIES, VARIOUS COLLEGE FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL

CONFERENCES, THE PGA TOUR, AND THE INDY RACING LEAGUE, INCLUDING

THE INDIANAPOLIS 500. THE CURRENT AGREEMENT WITH THE NFL EXPIRES

AFTER THE TELECAST OF THE 2006 PRO BOWL. BEGINNING WITH THE

2006/2007 SEASON, MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL WILL BE TELECAST ON

ESPN, AND THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK WILL NOT HAVE RIGHTS TO

TELEVISE NFL MONDAY NIGHT FOOTBALL IN FUTURE SEASONS.

FEDERAL REGULATION

TELEVISION AND RADIO BROADCASTING ARE SUBJECT TO

EXTENSIVE REGULATION BY THE FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION

(FCC) UNDER FEDERAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, INCLUDING THE

COMMUNICATIONS ACT OF 1934, AS AMENDED. VIOLATION OF FCC

REGULATIONS CAN RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL MONETARY FORFEITURES,

LIMITED RENEWALS OF LICENSES AND, IN EGREGIOUS CASES, DENIAL OF

LICENSE RENEWAL OR REVOCATION OF A LICENSE. FCC REGULATIONS THAT

AFFECT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



LICENSING OF TELEVISION AND RADIO

STATIONS.

EACH OF THE TELEVISION AND

RADIO STATIONS WE OWN MUST BE LICENSED BY THE FCC. THESE

LICENSES ARE GRANTED FOR PERIODS OF UP TO EIGHT YEARS, AND WE

MUST OBTAIN RENEWAL OF LICENSES AS THEY EXPIRE IN ORDER TO

CONTINUE OPERATING THE STATIONS. WE (OR THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN

THE CASE OF A DIVESTITURE) MUST ALSO OBTAIN FCC APPROVAL

WHENEVER WE SEEK TO HAVE A LICENSE TRANSFERRED IN CONNECTION

WITH THE ACQUISITION OR DIVESTITURE OF A STATION. THE FCC MAY

DECLINE TO RENEW OR APPROVE THE TRANSFER OF A LICENSE IN CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE GENERALLY RECEIVED SUCH RENEWALS

AND APPROVALS IN THE PAST, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE

WILL ALWAYS OBTAIN NECESSARY RENEWALS AND APPROVALS IN THE

FUTURE.



TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP

LIMITS.

THE FCC IMPOSES LIMITATIONS ON

THE NUMBER OF TELEVISION STATIONS AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN

IN A SPECIFIC MARKET, ON THE COMBINED NUMBER

-9-

OF TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS WE CAN OWN IN A

SINGLE MARKET AND ON THE AGGREGATE PERCENTAGE OF THE NATIONAL

AUDIENCE THAT CAN BE REACHED BY TELEVISION STATIONS WE OWN.

CURRENTLY.



FCC REGULATIONS PRESENTLY PERMIT US TO OWN AN

ADDITIONAL TELEVISION STATION IN ALL OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE

HAVE TELEVISION STATIONS EXCEPT TOLEDO, OHIO; FLINT, MICHIGAN;

AND RALEIGH-DURHAM, NORTH CAROLINA. WE DO NOT OWN MORE THAN ONE

TELEVISION STATION IN ANY OF THE TEN MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN A

TELEVISION STATION.



FEDERAL STATUTES PERMIT OUR TELEVISION STATIONS

IN THE AGGREGATE TO REACH A MAXIMUM OF 39% OF THE NATIONAL

AUDIENCE (FCC REGULATIONS ATTRIBUTE TO UHF TELEVISION STATIONS

ONLY 50% OF THE TELEVISION HOUSEHOLDS IN THEIR MARKET). OUR

STATIONS REACH APPROXIMATELY 24% OF THE NATIONAL AUDIENCE

(APPROXIMATELY 23% WHEN CALCULATED USING THE FCCS

ATTRIBUTION RULE).



FCC REGULATIONS IN SOME CASES IMPOSE RESTRICTIONS

ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL RADIO OR TELEVISION

STATIONS IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OWN RADIO STATIONS, BUT WE

DO NOT BELIEVE ANY SUCH LIMITATIONS ARE MATERIAL TO OUR CURRENT

OPERATING PLANS.

IN JULY 2003, THE FCC ADOPTED REVISED LIMITS ON

TELEVISION AND RADIO STATION OWNERSHIP. THE RULES ADOPTED

GENERALLY WOULD RELAX EXISTING OWNERSHIP RESTRICTIONS AND WOULD

PERMIT ENTITIES TO OWN MORE TELEVISION AND RADIO STATIONS IN

SOME MARKETS, BUT WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE THE 50% DISCOUNT FOR

CALCULATING HOUSEHOLDS REACHED BY UHF TELEVISION STATIONS

OPERATED BY THE TOP FOUR BROADCAST TELEVISION NETWORKS

(INCLUDING ABC). THE NEW RULES, HOWEVER, WERE CHALLENGED IN

FEDERAL COURT AND WERE REMANDED BY THE COURT TO THE FCC TO

REVIEW THE RULES. AS A RESULT, MOST OF THE REVISED RULES ADOPTED

BY THE FCC IN JULY 2003 ARE NOT IN EFFECT. ALTHOUGH IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT THE FCC MAY IMPLEMENT MORE LIBERAL MEDIA OWNERSHIP

RULES THAN THOSE CURRENTLY IN EFFECT (OTHER THAN THOSE GOVERNED

BY STATUTE), WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER THE REVISED RULES WILL BE

IMPLEMENTED AND IF SO, WHEN SUCH RULES WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE.



DUAL NETWORKS.

FCC

RULES CURRENTLY PROHIBIT ANY OF THE FOUR MAJOR TELEVISION

NETWORKS  ABC, CBS, FOX AND NBC  FROM

BEING UNDER COMMON OWNERSHIP OR CONTROL. THE NEW FCC RULES, IF

IMPLEMENTED, WOULD NOT MODIFY THIS LIMITATION.



REGULATION OF

PROGRAMMING.

THE FCC REGULATES

PROGRAMMING BY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, BANNING INDECENT

PROGRAMMING, REGULATING POLITICAL ADVERTISING, AND IMPOSING

COMMERCIAL TIME LIMITS DURING CHILDRENS PROGRAMMING.

BROADCASTERS FACE A HEIGHTENED RISK OF BEING FOUND IN VIOLATION

OF THE INDECENCY PROHIBITION BY THE FCC BECAUSE OF RECENT FCC

DECISIONS, COUPLED WITH THE SPONTANEITY OF LIVE PROGRAMMING.

RECENTLY, THE FCC HAS INDICATED THAT IT IS STEPPING UP

ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES AS THEY APPLY TO INDECENCY, AND HAS

INDICATED IT WOULD CONSIDER LICENSE REVOCATION FOR SERIOUS

VIOLATIONS. MOREOVER, LEGISLATION HAS BEEN INTRODUCED IN

CONGRESS THAT WOULD INCREASE PENALTIES FOR BROADCASTING INDECENT

PROGRAMMING.

FEDERAL LEGISLATION AND FCC RULES ALSO LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF

COMMERCIAL MATTER THAT MAY BE SHOWN ON BROADCAST OR CABLE

CHANNELS DURING PROGRAMMING DESIGNED FOR CHILDREN 12 YEARS

OF AGE AND YOUNGER. IN ADDITION, BROADCAST CHANNELS ARE

GENERALLY REQUIRED TO PROVIDE A MINIMUM OF THREE HOURS PER WEEK

OF PROGRAMMING THAT HAS AS A SIGNIFICANT PURPOSE

MEETING THE EDUCATIONAL AND INFORMATIONAL NEEDS OF CHILDREN

16 YEARS OF AGE AND YOUNGER. FCC RULES ALSO GIVE TELEVISION

STATION OWNERS THE RIGHT TO REJECT OR REFUSE NETWORK PROGRAMMING

IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OR TO SUBSTITUTE PROGRAMMING THAT THE

LICENSEE REASONABLY BELIEVES TO BE OF GREATER LOCAL OR NATIONAL

IMPORTANCE.



CABLE AND SATELLITE CARRIAGE OF BROADCAST

TELEVISION STATIONS.

WITH RESPECT TO

CABLE SYSTEMS OPERATING WITHIN A TELEVISION STATIONS

DESIGNATED MARKET AREA, FCC RULES REQUIRE THAT EVERY THREE YEARS

EACH TELEVISION STATION ELECT EITHER MUST CARRY

STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH CABLE OPERATORS GENERALLY MUST CARRY A

LOCAL TELEVISION STATION IN THE STATIONS MARKET, OR

RETRANSMISSION CONSENT STATUS, PURSUANT TO WHICH THE

CABLE OPERATOR MUST NEGOTIATE WITH THE TELEVISION STATION TO

OBTAIN THE CONSENT OF THE TELEVISION STATION PRIOR TO CARRYING

ITS SIGNAL. UNDER THE

-10-

SATELLITE HOME VIEWER IMPROVEMENT ACT AND ITS

SUCCESSOR, THE SATELLITE HOME VIEWER EXTENSION AND

REAUTHORIZATION ACT, SATELLITE CARRIERS ARE PERMITTED TO

RETRANSMIT A LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS SIGNAL INTO ITS

LOCAL MARKET WITH THE CONSENT OF THE LOCAL TELEVISION STATION.

IF A SATELLITE CARRIER ELECTS TO CARRY ONE LOCAL STATION IN A

MARKET, THE SATELLITE CARRIER MUST CARRY THE SIGNALS OF ALL

LOCAL TELEVISION STATIONS THAT ALSO REQUEST CARRIAGE. CERTAIN OF

THE SATELLITE CARRIAGE PROVISIONS ARE SET TO EXPIRE ON

DECEMBER 31, 2009.



DIGITAL TELEVISION.

FCC RULES CURRENTLY REQUIRE FULL-POWER ANALOG TELEVISION

STATIONS, SUCH AS OURS, TO PROVIDE DIGITAL SERVICE ON A SECOND

BROADCAST CHANNEL GRANTED SPECIFICALLY FOR THE PHASE-IN OF

DIGITAL BROADCASTING. FCC RULES ALSO REGULATE DIGITAL

BROADCASTING TO ENSURE CONTINUED QUALITY CARRIAGE OF MANDATED

FREE OVER-THE-AIR PROGRAM SERVICE. ALL OF THE COMPANYS

STATIONS HAVE LAUNCHED DIGITAL FACILITIES, AND WE ARE EVALUATING

VARIOUS OPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO USE OF DIGITAL CHANNELS. UNDER

CURRENT LAW, ALL BROADCASTERS ARE REQUIRED TO OPERATE

EXCLUSIVELY IN DIGITAL MODE AND PERMANENTLY SURRENDER ONE OF

THEIR TWO CHANNELS BY DECEMBER 31, 2006. HOWEVER, THE FCC

HAS THE AUTHORITY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO EXTEND THIS

DEADLINE IN A PARTICULAR MARKET UPON THE REQUEST OF A STATION.

CONGRESS IS CONTEMPLATING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD CREATE A

HARD DATE BY WHICH TELEVISION STATIONS WOULD HAVE TO

SURRENDER ONE CHANNEL AND WHICH WOULD ELIMINATE THE FCC

EXTENSION PROCESS.

THE FOREGOING IS A BRIEF SUMMARY OF CERTAIN

PROVISIONS OF THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT AND OTHER LEGISLATION AND

OF SPECIFIC FCC RULES AND POLICIES. THIS SUMMARY FOCUSES ON

PROVISIONS MATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE TO

THE COMMUNICATIONS ACT, OTHER LEGISLATION, FCC RULES AND PUBLIC

NOTICES AND RULINGS OF THE FCC FOR FURTHER INFORMATION

CONCERNING THE NATURE AND EXTENT OF THE FCCS REGULATORY

AUTHORITY.

FCC LAWS AND REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGE,

AND THE COMPANY GENERALLY CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER NEW

LEGISLATION, COURT ACTION OR REGULATIONS, OR A CHANGE IN THE

EXTENT OF APPLICATION OR ENFORCEMENT OF CURRENT LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS.

COMPETITION AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

PROTECTION

THE SUCCESS OF STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT OPERATIONS IS

HEAVILY DEPENDENT UPON PUBLIC TASTE AND PREFERENCES. IN

ADDITION, STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT OPERATING RESULTS FLUCTUATE DUE

TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL,

HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND TELEVISION MARKETS. RELEASE DATES ARE

DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE

TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS.

THE STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH

ALL FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT. A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF COMPANIES

PRODUCE AND/OR DISTRIBUTE THEATRICAL AND TELEVISION FILMS,

EXPLOIT PRODUCTS IN THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET, PROVIDE PAY

TELEVISION PROGRAMMING SERVICES AND SPONSOR LIVE THEATER. WE

ALSO COMPETE TO OBTAIN CREATIVE AND PERFORMING TALENTS, STORY

PROPERTIES, ADVERTISER SUPPORT, BROADCAST RIGHTS AND MARKET

SHARE, WHICH ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE SUCCESS OF OUR STUDIO

ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES.

THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO EXPLOIT AND PROTECT

RIGHTS IN ITS CONTENT, INCLUDING ITS MOTION PICTURES, TELEVISION

PROGRAMS AND SOUND RECORDINGS, IS AFFECTED BY THE STRENGTH AND

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES

AND ABROAD. INADEQUATE LAWS OR ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO PROTECT

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN A COUNTRY CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE

RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, DESPITE THE

COMPANYS STRONG EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. IN ADDITION, SOME

TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCES, SUCH AS PEER-TO-PEER TECHNOLOGY AND SOME

FEATURES OF DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDERS, AND OTHER FACTORS HAVE MADE

INFRINGEMENT EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT MORE CHALLENGING.

THEREFORE, THE COMPANY DEVOTES SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO

PROTECTING ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED USE IN

THE UNITED STATES AND FOREIGN MARKETS.

THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO

THE RISK OF CHALLENGES BY THIRD PARTIES CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT OF

THEIR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS. REGARDLESS OF THEIR VALIDITY, SUCH

CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERSION OF

RESOURCES, WHICH COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

COMPANYS FILM AND TELEVISION PROPERTIES, CONSUMER PRODUCTS

DEVELOPS NEW INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WITHIN ITS PUBLISHING AND

INTERACTIVE GAMING DIVISIONS WITH THE POTENTIAL OF BEING

LEVERAGED ACROSS THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ALSO ENGAGES IN

EXPANDED ITS ABILITY TO DESIGN INDIVIDUAL

PRODUCTS ACROSS ALL CATEGORIES AND CREATE EXCLUSIVE THEMED AND

SEASONAL PROMOTIONAL CAMPAIGNS FOR RETAILERS BASED ON

COMPETITION, SEASONALITY, AND INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY PROTECTION

THE COMPANY COMPETES IN ITS CHARACTER

MERCHANDISING AND OTHER LICENSING, PUBLISHING, INTERACTIVE AND

RETAIL ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER LICENSORS, PUBLISHERS AND RETAILERS

OF CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES. ALTHOUGH PUBLIC

INFORMATION IS LIMITED, WE BELIEVE THE COMPANY IS THE LARGEST

WORLDWIDE LICENSOR OF CHARACTER-BASED MERCHANDISE AND

PRODUCER/DISTRIBUTOR OF CHILDRENS FILM-RELATED PRODUCTS

BASED ON RETAIL SALES. OPERATING RESULTS FOR THE LICENSING AND

RETAIL DISTRIBUTION BUSINESS ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER

PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF

ANIMATED THEATRICAL RELEASES.

THE COMPANYS LICENSING BUSINESSES, AS WELL

AS ITS MEDIA NETWORKS, STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT AND THEME PARK AND

RESORT OPERATIONS, ARE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

EXPLOIT AND PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, INCLUDING

TRADEMARKS, TRADE NAMES, COPYRIGHTS, PATENTS AND TRADE SECRETS,

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. AS A RESULT, DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN LAWS

PROTECTING INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

-20-

ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY. THE RIGHT AND

ABILITY TO ENFORCE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AGAINST

INFRINGEMENT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESSES.

THESE BUSINESSES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF CHALLENGES BY

THIRD PARTIES CLAIMING INFRINGEMENT OF THEIR PROPRIETARY RIGHTS.

REGARDLESS OF THEIR VALIDITY, SUCH CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN

SUBSTANTIAL COSTS AND DIVERSION OF RESOURCES WHICH COULD HAVE AN

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS LICENSING OPERATIONS.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

FOR AN ENTERPRISE AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS THE

COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE

DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS

AFFECTING SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPERATIONS IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION

WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF THESE OPERATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL

RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING.

CHANGES IN U.S., GLOBAL OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF

OUR BUSINESSES.

A DECREASE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED

STATES OR IN OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND FOR ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, THUS

REDUCING OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS. A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS COULD REDUCE ATTENDANCE AND SPENDING AT ONE OR MORE

OF OUR PARKS AND RESORTS, PURCHASE OF OR PRICES FOR ADVERTISING

ON OUR BROADCAST OR CABLE NETWORKS OR OWNED STATIONS, PRICES

THAT CABLE OPERATORS WILL PAY FOR OUR CABLE PROGRAMMING,

PERFORMANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL AND HOME ENTERTAINMENT RELEASES

AND PURCHASES OF COMPANY-LICENSED CONSUMER PRODUCTS. IN

ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN PRICE LEVELS GENERALLY, OR IN PRICE

LEVELS IN A PARTICULAR SECTOR SUCH AS THE ENERGY SECTOR, COULD

RESULT IN A SHIFT IN CONSUMER DEMAND AWAY FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT

AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS WE OFFER, WHICH COULD ALSO ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASE OUR COSTS.

CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY REDUCE

INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCREASE OUR LABOR OR

SUPPLY COSTS IN NON-UNITED STATES MARKETS OR REDUCE THE UNITED

STATES DOLLAR VALUE OF REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER MARKETS.

CHANGES IN PUBLIC AND CONSUMER TASTES AND

PREFERENCES FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD REDUCE

DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS AND REDUCE

PROFITABILITY.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES CREATES ENTERTAINMENT OR

CONSUMER PRODUCTS WHOSE SUCCESS DEPENDS SUBSTANTIALLY ON

CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES THAT CHANGE IN OFTEN

UNPREDICTABLE WAYS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR

ABILITY TO CONSISTENTLY CREATE AND DISTRIBUTE FILMED

ENTERTAINMENT, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, THEME PARK

ATTRACTIONS, RESORT FACILITIES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT MEET

THE CHANGING PREFERENCES OF THE BROAD CONSUMER MARKET. MANY OF

OUR BUSINESSES INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON WORLDWIDE ACCEPTANCE OF

OUR OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS, AND THEIR SUCCESS THEREFORE DEPENDS

ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT AND ADAPT TO CHANGING

CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES OUTSIDE AS WELL AS INSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. MOREOVER, WE MUST OFTEN INVEST SUBSTANTIAL

AMOUNTS IN FILM PRODUCTION, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING,

THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS OR RESORT FACILITIES BEFORE WE LEARN THE

EXTENT TO WHICH PRODUCTS WILL EARN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. IF OUR

ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT

CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, OUR REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING SALES (WHICH

ARE BASED IN PART ON RATINGS FOR THE PROGRAMS IN WHICH

ADVERTISEMENTS

-21-

AIR) OR SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR BROADCAST AND CABLE

PROGRAMMING, FROM THEATRICAL FILM RECEIPTS OR HOME VIDEO SALES,

FROM THEME PARK ADMISSIONS, FROM SALES OF LICENSED CONSUMER

PRODUCTS OR FROM SALES OF OUR OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES MAY DECLINE AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF

ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES.

CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND IN CONSUMER

CONSUMPTION PATTERNS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT

PRODUCTS OR THE COST OF PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING

PRODUCTS.

THE MEDIA AND ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESSES IN WHICH

WE PARTICIPATE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR ABILITY TO ACQUIRE,

DEVELOP, ADOPT AND EXPLOIT NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO DISTINGUISH OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS. IN

ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGIES AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS

AND THE TIME AND MANNER IN WHICH CONSUMERS ACQUIRE AND VIEW SOME

OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS. FOR EXAMPLE.



THE SUCCESS OF OUR OFFERINGS IN THE HOME

ENTERTAINMENT MARKET DEPENDS IN PART ON CONSUMER PREFERENCES

WITH RESPECT TO HOME ENTERTAINMENT FORMATS, INCLUDING DVD

PLAYERS AND PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDERS, AS WELL AS THE

AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE HOME ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND

TECHNOLOGIES;



TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENTS OFFER CONSUMERS AN

EXPANDING ARRAY OF ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS AND IF CONSUMERS FAVOR

OPTIONS WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED RATHER THAN THE

ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS WE OFFER, OUR SALES MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF PROTECTING THESE RIGHTS

OR REDUCE OUR REVENUES.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT

ON MAINTENANCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE

ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE CREATE. NEW TECHNOLOGIES

SUCH AS PEER-TO-PEER TECHNOLOGY, HIGH SPEED DIGITAL TRANSMISSION

(INCLUDING DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION OF THEATRICAL FILMS) AND SOME

FEATURES OF DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDERS HAVE MADE INFRINGEMENT OF

OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN FILMS AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING

EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS MORE CHALLENGING. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT UNAUTHORIZED USE

OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY

GENERALLY IS A SIGNIFICANT AND RAPIDLY GROWING PHENOMENON. THESE

DEVELOPMENTS REQUIRE US TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO

PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST UNAUTHORIZED USE

AND PRESENT THE RISK OF INCREASED LOSSES OF REVENUE AS A RESULT

OF SALES OF UNAUTHORIZED PRODUCTS.

A VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS MAY REDUCE

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO

PROVIDE OR INCREASE THE COST OF PROVIDING PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES.

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

PARTICULARLY OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS, IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON

THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM. THE ENVIRONMENT

FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM AS WELL AS DEMAND FOR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT

PRODUCTS CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE UNITED

STATES, GLOBALLY OR IN SPECIFIC REGIONS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY

OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING: ADVERSE WEATHER

CONDITIONS OR NATURAL DISASTERS (SUCH AS EXCESSIVE HEAT OR RAIN,

HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES); HEALTH CONCERNS; INTERNATIONAL,

POLITICAL OR MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS; AND TERRORIST ATTACKS. THESE

EVENTS, AND OTHERS SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN TRAVEL AND ENERGY

COSTS AND COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACKS OR OTHER WIDESPREAD COMPUTING

OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, MAY ALSO DAMAGE OUR ABILITY TO

PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THESE EVENTS COULD THEREFORE

REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR RESULT IN A REDUCTION IN DEMAND FOR OR

ABILITY TO PROVIDE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR INCREASE OUR COSTS

TO THE EXTENT DAMAGE IS NOT COVERED BY INSURANCE OR IS SUBJECT

TO SELF-INSURANCE.

SUSTAINED INCREASES IN COSTS OF PENSION AND

POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL AND OTHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELFARE

BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

WITH MORE THAN 133,000 EMPLOYEES, OUR

PROFITABILITY IS SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED BY COSTS OF PENSION

BENEFITS AND CURRENT AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. IN

RECENT YEARS, WE HAVE EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THESE

COSTS AS A RESULT OF MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL,

INCLUDING

-22-

INCREASES IN HEALTH CARE COSTS, DECLINES IN

INVESTMENT RETURNS ON PLAN ASSETS AND CHANGES IN DISCOUNT RATES

USED TO CALCULATE PENSION AND RELATED LIABILITIES. AT LEAST SOME

OF THESE MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS MAY CONTINUE TO PUT UPWARD

PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING PENSION AND MEDICAL BENEFITS.

ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE

COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN

LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE COULD

REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR

RESTRUCTURING OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS OR

OTHERWISE AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OCCUR WE

MAY NEED TO ADJUST OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES TO MEET THESE CHANGES

OR WE MAY OTHERWISE FIND IT NECESSARY TO RESTRUCTURE OUR

OPERATIONS OR PARTICULAR BUSINESSES OR ASSETS. IN ADDITION,

EXTERNAL EVENTS INCLUDING ACCEPTANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL OFFERINGS

AND CHANGES IN MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY IMPAIR THE VALUE OF

OUR ASSETS. WHEN THESE CHANGES OR EVENTS OCCUR, WE MAY INCUR

COSTS TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND MAY NEED TO WRITE DOWN

THE VALUE OF ASSETS. WE MAY ALSO NEED TO INVEST IN NEW

BUSINESSES THAT HAVE SHORT-TERM RETURNS THAT ARE NEGATIVE OR LOW

AND WHOSE ULTIMATE BUSINESS PROSPECTS ARE UNCERTAIN. IN ANY OF

THESE EVENTS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE, WE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT

CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS OR RETURNS ON

NEW INVESTMENTS MAY BE LOWER THAN PRIOR TO THE CHANGE IN

STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING.

MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS MAY IMPEDE ACCESS TO OR

INCREASE THE COST OF FINANCING OUR OPERATIONS AND

INVESTMENTS.

CHANGES IN U.S. AND GLOBAL FINANCIAL AND EQUITY

MARKETS, INCLUDING MARKET DISRUPTIONS AND SIGNIFICANT INTEREST

RATE FLUCTUATIONS, MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN

FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS OR INCREASE THE COST

OF OBTAINING FINANCING. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE

AFFECTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY

INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT

PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CREDIT

METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. A

DECREASE IN THESE RATINGS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING

OR MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING.

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY REDUCE OUR

REVENUES OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN EACH OF OUR

BUSINESSES FROM ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS OF THE PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES WE OFFER AND FROM OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT,

LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATIONAL ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO MUST

COMPETE TO OBTAIN HUMAN RESOURCES, PROGRAMMING AND OTHER

RESOURCES WE REQUIRE IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND STATIONS

COMPETE FOR VIEWERS WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE

SERVICES AS WELL AS WITH HOME VIDEO PRODUCTS AND INTERNET USAGE.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND STATIONS

COMPETE FOR THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME WITH OTHER BROADCAST,

CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES, AS WELL AS NEWSPAPER, MAGAZINES,

BILLBOARDS AND THE INTERNET.



OUR CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR CARRIAGE OF THEIR

PROGRAMMING WITH OTHER PROGRAMMING PROVIDERS.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR THE

ACQUISITION OF CREATIVE TALENT AND SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING

WITH OTHER BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS.



OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS COMPETE FOR GUESTS

WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND

RECREATION ACTIVITIES.



OUR STUDIO OPERATIONS COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS WITH

ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT.

-23-



OUR STUDIO OPERATIONS, BROADCAST AND CABLE

NETWORKS AND PUBLISHING BUSINESSES COMPETE TO OBTAIN CREATIVE

AND PERFORMING TALENT, STORY PROPERTIES, ADVERTISER SUPPORT,

BROADCAST RIGHTS AND MARKET SHARE.



OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT COMPETES IN THE

CHARACTER MERCHANDISING AND OTHER LICENSING, PUBLISHING,

INTERACTIVE AND RETAIL ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER LICENSORS,

PUBLISHERS AND RETAILERS OF CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES.

COMPETITION IN EACH OF THESE AREAS MAY DIVERT

CONSUMERS FROM OUR CREATIVE OR OTHER PRODUCTS, OR TO OTHER

PRODUCTS OR OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR

REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR MARKETING COSTS. COMPETITION FOR THE

ACQUISITION OF RESOURCES CAN INCREASE THE COST OF PRODUCING OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

OUR RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF

LONG-TERM PROGRAMMING OR CARRIAGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT RENEWED ON

SUFFICIENTLY FAVORABLE TERMS.

WE ENTER INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR BOTH THE

ACQUISITION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA PROGRAMMING AND

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTS FOR THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING

RIGHTS FOR SPORTING EVENTS AND OTHER PROGRAMS, AND CONTRACTS FOR

THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PROGRAMMING TO CABLE AND SATELLITE

OPERATORS. AS THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRE, WE MUST RENEW OR

RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RENEW THEM ON

ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY LOSE PROGRAMMING RIGHTS OR DISTRIBUTION

RIGHTS. EVEN IF THESE CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED, THE COST OF

OBTAINING PROGRAMMING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE (OR INCREASE AT FASTER

RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE) OR THE REVENUE FROM

DISTRIBUTION OF PROGRAMS MAY BE REDUCED (OR INCREASE AT SLOWER

RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE). WITH RESPECT TO THE

ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY SPORTS

PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, THE IMPACT OF THESE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS ON

OUR RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER

OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS,

EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER

AUDIENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT REVENUES FROM

PROGRAMMING BASED ON THESE RIGHTS WILL EXCEED THE COST OF THE

RIGHTS PLUS THE OTHER COSTS OF PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING THE

PROGRAMMING.

CHANGES IN REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR

BUSINESSES MAY IMPAIR THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR

BUSINESSES.

OUR BROADCAST NETWORKS AND TELEVISION STATIONS

ARE HIGHLY REGULATED, AND EACH OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES IS

SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF UNITED STATES AND OVERSEAS REGULATIONS.

THESE REGULATIONS INCLUDE.



UNITED STATES FCC REGULATION OF OUR TELEVISION

AND RADIO NETWORKS AND OWNED STATIONS, INCLUDING LICENSING OF

STATIONS, OWNERSHIP LIMITS, PROHIBITIONS ON INDECENT

PROGRAMMING AND RESTRICTIONS ON COMMERCIAL TIME IN

CHILDRENS PROGRAMMING AND REGULATION OF OUR BROADCASTING

BUSINESSES IN NON-UNITED STATES MARKETS. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

REGARDING FCC REGULATION IS PROVIDED IN

ITEM 1  BUSINESS  MEDIA

NETWORKS, FEDERAL REGULATION.



ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION REGULATIONS.



FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN PRIVACY AND DATA

PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS.



REGULATION OF THE SAFETY OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND

THEME PARK OPERATIONS.



IMPOSITION BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES OF TRADE

RESTRICTIONS OR MOTION PICTURE OR TELEVISION CONTENT

REQUIREMENTS OR QUOTAS.



DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TAX LAWS OR CURRENCY

CONTROLS.

CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE REGULATORY AREAS MAY

REQUIRE US TO SPEND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS TO COMPLY WITH THE

REGULATIONS, OR MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES THAT ARE PROFITABLE.

-24-

LABOR DISPUTES MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND

IMPAIR OUR PROFITABILITY.

A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN VARIOUS OF

OUR BUSINESSES ARE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS,

INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS AS WELL AS

WRITERS, DIRECTORS, ACTORS, PRODUCTION PERSONNEL AND OTHERS

EMPLOYED IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS AND STUDIO OPERATIONS. IN

ADDITION, THE EMPLOYEES OF LICENSEES WHO MANUFACTURE AND

RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS MAY BE COVERED BY

COLLECTIVE LABOR AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS. A LABOR

DISPUTE INVOLVING OUR EMPLOYEES OR THE EMPLOYEES OF OUR

LICENSEES OR RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS MAY

DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUES, AND RESOLUTION

OF DISPUTES WITH OUR EMPLOYEES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS.

PROVISIONS IN OUR CORPORATE DOCUMENTS AND

DELAWARE STATE LAW COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL,

EVEN IF THAT CHANGE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO

SHAREHOLDERS.

OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION

CONTAINS A PROVISION REGULATING THE ABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS TO

BRING MATTERS FOR ACTION BEFORE ANNUAL AND SPECIAL MEETINGS AND

AUTHORIZES OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE AND SET THE TERMS OF

PREFERRED STOCK. THE REGULATIONS ON SHAREHOLDER ACTION COULD

MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ANY PERSON SEEKING TO ACQUIRE CONTROL

OF THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF ACTIONS THAT

WOULD SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD

EFFECTIVELY DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF ANY PERSON SEEKING CONTROL

OR OTHERWISE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN CONTROL. IN

ADDITION, WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF THE

DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW, WHICH COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF

DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE OF CONTROL IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE SEASONALITY OF CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES

COULD EXACERBATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES IS NORMALLY SUBJECT TO

SEASONAL VARIATIONS, AS FOLLOWS.



REVENUES IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ARE

INFLUENCED BY ADVERTISER DEMAND AND THE SEASONAL NATURE OF

PROGRAMMING, AND GENERALLY PEAK IN THE SPRING AND FALL.



REVENUES IN OUR PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT

FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT

OCCUPANCY RESULTING FROM THE SEASONAL NATURE OF VACATION TRAVEL.

PEAK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY GENERALLY OCCUR DURING THE

SUMMER MONTHS, WHEN SCHOOL VACATIONS OCCUR, AND DURING

EARLY-WINTER AND SPRING HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT

FLUCTUATE BASED ON THE TIMING OF THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE, HOME

ENTERTAINMENT AND TELEVISION RELEASES. RELEASE DATES FOR

THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND TELEVISION PRODUCTS ARE

DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING TIMING OF VACATION AND

HOLIDAY PERIODS AND COMPETITION IN THE MARKET.



REVENUES IN OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE

INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AND THE

TIMING OF ANIMATED THEATRICAL RELEASES AND GENERALLY PEAK IN OUR

FIRST FISCAL QUARTER DUE TO THE HOLIDAY SEASON.

ACCORDINGLY, IF A SHORT TERM NEGATIVE IMPACT ON

OUR BUSINESS OCCURS DURING A TIME OF HIGH SEASONAL DEMAND (SUCH

AS HURRICANE DAMAGE TO OUR PARKS DURING THE SUMMER TRAVEL

SEASON), THE EFFECT COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE

RESULTS OF THAT BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

MILNE AND DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. V.

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC.

ON

NOVEMBER 5, 2002, CLARE MILNE, THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF

A. A. MILNE, AUTHOR OF THE WINNIE THE POOH BOOKS, AND

THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. (DEI)

FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. (SSI) IN THE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF

CALIFORNIA. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2002, MS. MILNE SERVED

NOTICES TO SSI AND DEI TERMINATING A. A. MILNES

PRIOR GRANT OF RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH, EFFECTIVE

NOVEMBER 5, 2004, AND GRANTED ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS TO DEI.

IN THEIR LAWSUIT, MS. MILNE AND DEI SEEK A DECLARATORY

JUDGMENT, UNDER UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT LAW, THAT

MS. MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE VALID; THAT

SSIS RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH IN THE UNITED STATES

TERMINATED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004; THAT UPON

TERMINATION OF SSIS RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 1983

LICENSING AGREEMENT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE

STEPHEN

SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

LAWSUIT

TERMINATED BY OPERATION OF LAW; AND THAT, AS OF NOVEMBER 5,

2004, SSI WAS ENTITLED TO NO FURTHER ROYALTIES FOR USES OF

WINNIE THE POOH. SSI FILED (A) AN ANSWER DENYING THE

MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT AND (B) COUNTERCLAIMS

SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT (I) MS. MILNES GRANT

OF RIGHTS TO DEI IS VOID AND

-26-

UNENFORCEABLE AND (II) DEI REMAINS OBLIGATED

TO PAY SSI ROYALTIES UNDER THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT. SSI

ALSO FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT OR, IN THE

ALTERNATIVE, FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE COURT RULED

THAT MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES ARE INVALID AND DISMISSED

SSIS COUNTERCLAIMS AS MOOT. FOLLOWING FURTHER MOTIONS SSI

FILED AN AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS AND A THIRD-PARTY

COMPLAINT AGAINST HARRIET HUNT (HEIR TO E. H. SHEPARD,

ILLUSTRATOR OF THE ORIGINAL WINNIE THE POOH STORIES), WHO HAD

SERVED A NOTICE OF TERMINATION AND A GRANT OF RIGHTS SIMILAR TO

MS. MILNES. BY ORDER DATED AUGUST 3, 2004, THE

COURT GRANTED SSI LEAVE TO AMEND ITS ANSWER TO ASSERT

COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE

MILNE AND HUNT TERMINATIONS AND THE GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI FOR

(A) UNLAWFUL AND UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES; AND

(B) BREACH OF THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT. IN NOVEMBER

2004, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED A MOTION BY MILNE TO DISMISS

HER COMPLAINT FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING A FINAL APPEALABLE

ORDER OF DISMISSAL, SO AS TO PERMIT HER APPEAL TO THE COURT OF

APPEALS TO PROCEED. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THAT APPEAL WAS HEARD ON

SEPTEMBER 13, 2005.

IN RE THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY DERIVATIVE

LITIGATION.

WILLIAM AND GERALDINE

BREHM AND THIRTEEN OTHER INDIVIDUALS FILED AN AMENDED AND

CONSOLIDATED COMPLAINT ON MAY 28, 1997 IN THE DELAWARE

COURT OF CHANCERY SEEKING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, A DECLARATORY

JUDGMENT AGAINST EACH OF THE COMPANYS DIRECTORS AS OF

DECEMBER 1996 THAT THE COMPANYS 1995 EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENT

WITH ITS FORMER PRESIDENT MICHAEL S. OVITZ, WAS VOID, OR

ALTERNATIVELY THAT MR. OVITZS TERMINATION SHOULD BE

DEEMED A TERMINATION FOR CAUSE AND ANY SEVERANCE

PAYMENTS TO HIM FORFEITED. ON OCTOBER 8, 1998, THE DELAWARE

COURT OF CHANCERY DISMISSED ALL COUNTS OF THE AMENDED COMPLAINT.

PLAINTIFFS APPEALED, AND ON FEBRUARY 9, 2000, THE SUPREME

COURT OF DELAWARE AFFIRMED THE DISMISSAL BUT RULED ALSO THAT

PLAINTIFFS SHOULD BE PERMITTED TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE COURTS OPINION. THE PLAINTIFFS FILED

THEIR AMENDED COMPLAINT ON JANUARY 3, 2002. ON

FEBRUARY 6, 2003, THE COMPANYS DIRECTORS MOTION

TO DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS CONVERTED BY THE COURT TO A

MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND THE PLAINTIFFS WERE PERMITTED TO

TAKE DISCOVERY. THE COMPANY AND ITS DIRECTORS ANSWERED THE

AMENDED COMPLAINT ON APRIL 1, 2003. ON MAY 28, 2003,

THE COURT (TREATING AS A MOTION TO DISMISS THE MOTION FOR

SUMMARY JUDGMENT INTO WHICH IT HAD CONVERTED THE ORIGINAL MOTION

ON FEBRUARY 6, 2003) DENIED THE DIRECTORS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE AMENDED COMPLAINT. TRIAL COMMENCED ON

OCTOBER 20, 2004 AND ON AUGUST 9, 2005, THE DELAWARE

COURT OF CHANCERY ISSUED AN ORDER ENTERING JUDGMENT AGAINST THE

PLAINTIFFS AND IN FAVOR OF ALL DEFENDANTS ON ALL COUNTS.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED FROM THE ORDER.

SIMILAR OR IDENTICAL CLAIMS HAVE ALSO BEEN FILED

BY THE SAME PLAINTIFFS (OTHER THAN WILLIAM AND GERALDINE BREHM)

IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA, LOS ANGELES

COUNTY, BEGINNING WITH A CLAIM FILED BY RICHARD AND DAVID KAPLAN

ON JANUARY 3, 1997. ON MAY 18, 1998, AN ADDITIONAL

CLAIM WAS FILED IN THE SAME CALIFORNIA COURT BY DOROTHY L.

GREENFIELD. ALL OF THE CALIFORNIA CLAIMS WERE CONSOLIDATED AND

STAYED PENDING FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE DELAWARE PROCEEDINGS. THE

CLAIM FILED BY DOROTHY L. GREENFIELD WAS VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED

WITH PREJUDICE ON OCTOBER 24, 2005.

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT

DISNEY COMPANY.

IN THIS LAWSUIT, FILED

ON FEBRUARY 27, 1991 IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR

COURT, THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT A COMPANY SUBSIDIARY DEFRAUDED

IT AND BREACHED A 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO

CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH PROPERTIES, BY FAILING TO ACCOUNT FOR

AND PAY ROYALTIES ON REVENUES EARNED FROM THE SALE OF WINNIE THE

POOH MOVIES ON VIDEOCASSETTE AND FROM THE EXPLOITATION OF WINNIE

THE POOH MERCHANDISING RIGHTS. THE PLAINTIFF SEEKS DAMAGES FOR

THE LICENSEES ALLEGED BREACHES AS WELL AS CONFIRMATION OF

THE PLAINTIFFS INTERPRETATION OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT

WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE ACTIVITIES. THE PLAINTIFF ALSO SEEKS THE

RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT ON THE BASIS OF THE ALLEGED

BREACHES. IF EACH OF THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS WERE TO BE

CONFIRMED IN A FINAL JUDGMENT, DAMAGES AS ARGUED BY THE

PLAINTIFF COULD TOTAL AS MUCH AS SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE TO THE COMPANY OF ANY FUTURE

EXPLOITATION OF THE LICENSED RIGHTS. ON MARCH 29, 2004, THE

COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION FOR TERMINATING

SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF FOR A HOST OF DISCOVERY ABUSES,

INCLUDING THE WITHHOLDING, ALTERATION, AND THEFT OF DOCUMENTS

AND OTHER INFORMATION, AND, ON APRIL 5, 2004, DISMISSED

PLAINTIFFS CASE WITH

-27-

PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS

TO DISQUALIFY THE JUDGE WHO GRANTED THE TERMINATING SANCTIONS

WERE DENIED IN 2004, AND ITS MOTION FOR A NEW TRIAL

WAS DENIED ON JANUARY 26, 2005, ALLOWING PLAINTIFF TO

PROCEED WITH ITS NOTICED APPEAL FROM THE APRIL 5, 2004,

ORDER OF DISMISSAL.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT CURRENTLY

POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT, IF ANY, THAT THE ULTIMATE

RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES,

CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR

CO-DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS INVOLVING COPYRIGHT,

BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE

CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE

COMPANY TO SUFFER ANY MATERIAL LIABILITY BY REASON OF SUCH

ACTIONS.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

2005 VS. 2004

REVENUES FOR THE YEAR INCREASED 4%, OR

$1.2 BILLION, TO $31.9 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN

REVENUES WAS DUE TO GROWTH AT MEDIA NETWORKS AND PARKS AND

RESORTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT.

THE MEDIA NETWORKS GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER AFFILIATE FEES AT

CABLE NETWORKS AND HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUES. THE INCREASE AT

PARKS AND RESORTS WAS DUE TO AN ADDITIONAL SIX MONTHS OF EURO

DISNEY REVENUES IN FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004, AND

HIGHER OCCUPIED ROOM NIGHTS, THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND GUEST

SPENDING AT THE DOMESTIC RESORTS. THE DECLINE AT STUDIO WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO AN OVERALL DECLINE IN DVD UNIT SALES.

NET INCOME FOR THE YEAR INCREASED 8%, OR

$188 MILLION, TO $2.5 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN NET

INCOME WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH AT MEDIA NETWORKS, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A DECREASE AT STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT (SEE BUSINESS

SEGMENT RESULTS BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION). ADDITIONALLY, WE

ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

NO. 123R,

SHARE BASED PAYMENT

(SFAS 123R),

WHICH INCREASED EXPENSE FOR THE YEAR BY $253 MILLION

($160 MILLION AFTER-TAX OR $0.08 PER SHARE). DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF AN ACCOUNTING

CHANGE FOR THE VALUATION OF CERTAIN FCC LICENSES WAS $1.24, AN

INCREASE OF 11%, OR $0.12, COMPARED TO THE PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS

PER SHARE OF $1.12. WE ADOPTED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE

TOPIC D-108,

USE OF THE RESIDUAL METHOD TO VALUE

ACQUIRED ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL

(EITF D-108), WHICH

RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE TOTALING

$57 MILLION ($36 MILLION AFTER-TAX OR $0.02 PER

SHARE) RELATING TO THE VALUATION OF CERTAIN FCC LICENSES (SEE

NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE AFTER THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE ACCOUNTING

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS IN FISCAL 2005 ALLOWED

US TO CONTINUE MAKING CAPITAL INVESTMENTS IN OUR PROPERTIES AND

REDUCE OUR BORROWINGS, WHICH IN TURN REDUCED OUR INTEREST

EXPENSE. DURING FISCAL 2005, WE GENERATED CASH FLOW FROM

OPERATIONS OF $4.3 BILLION WHICH FUNDED CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES TOTALING $1.8 BILLION. IN ADDITION, WE

REPURCHASED $2.4 BILLION OF OUR COMMON STOCK AND HAD A NET

REPAYMENT OF BORROWINGS OF $699 MILLION.

2004 VS. 2003

REVENUES FOR THE YEAR INCREASED 14% OR

$3.7 BILLION, TO $30.8 BILLION. THE INCREASE IN

REVENUES FOR THE YEAR WAS DUE TO GROWTH IN SEGMENT REVENUES IN

ALL OF THE OPERATING SEGMENTS (SEE BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

BELOW FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION).

NET INCOME FOR FISCAL 2004 WAS $2.3 BILLION,

WHICH WAS $1.1 BILLION HIGHER THAN FISCAL 2003. THE

INCREASE IN NET INCOME FOR FISCAL 2004 WAS DRIVEN BY GROWTH AT

ALL OF THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR

FISCAL 2004 WAS $1.12, AN INCREASE OF $0.47 COMPARED TO THE

PRIOR-YEAR EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $0.65 BEFORE THE CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF AN ACCOUNTING CHANGE. AS SHOWN IN THE PRECEDING TABLE,

RESULTS FOR FISCAL 2004 AND 2003 INCLUDED CERTAIN ITEMS WHICH

AFFECTED COMPARABILITY. THESE ITEMS HAD AN AGGREGATE FAVORABLE

IMPACT OF $0.04 PER SHARE ON FISCAL 2004 RESULTS AND AN

AGGREGATE UNFAVORABLE IMPACT OF $0.01 PER SHARE ON FISCAL

2003 RESULTS.

-35-

ADDITIONALLY, WE MADE AN ACCOUNTING CHANGE

EFFECTIVE AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2003 TO ADOPT A NEW

ACCOUNTING RULE FOR MULTIPLE ELEMENT REVENUE ACCOUNTING

(EITF 00-21, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS) WHICH CHANGED THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION OF

NFL PROGRAMMING AT ESPN RESULTING IN AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF

$71 MILLION FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF THE CHANGE.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AFTER THIS CUMULATIVE EFFECT WAS

$0.62 FOR FISCAL 2003.

INCREASE, OR $852 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS, AND AN

11% INCREASE, OR $577 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING.

INCREASED CABLE NETWORKS REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY

DUE TO GROWTH OF $690 MILLION FROM CABLE AND SATELLITE

OPERATORS AND $172 MILLION IN ADVERTISING REVENUES.

REVENUES FROM CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS ARE GENERALLY

DERIVED FROM FEES CHARGED ON A PER SUBSCRIBER BASIS, AND THE

INCREASE IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS DUE TO CONTRACTUAL RATE

INCREASES AND SUBSCRIBER GROWTH AT ESPN AND THE DISNEY CHANNELS.

INCREASED ADVERTISING REVENUE WAS DUE TO HIGHER RATES AT ESPN

AND HIGHER RATINGS AT ABC FAMILY.

-37-

THE COMPANYS CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH

CABLE AND SATELLITE OPERATORS ARE RENEWED OR RENEGOTIATED FROM

TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS. A NUMBER OF

THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE CURRENTLY IN NEGOTIATION. CONSOLIDATION

IN THE CABLE AND SATELLITE DISTRIBUTION INDUSTRY AND OTHER

FACTORS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

OBTAIN AND MAINTAIN CONTRACTUAL TERMS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF

ITS VARIOUS CABLE AND SATELLITE PROGRAMMING SERVICES THAT ARE AS

FAVORABLE AS THOSE CURRENTLY IN PLACE. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR,

REVENUES FROM CABLE NETWORKS COULD INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN

IN THE PAST OR COULD STABILIZE OR DECLINE. CERTAIN OF THE

COMPANYS EXISTING CONTRACTS WITH CABLE AND SATELLITE

OPERATORS AS WELL AS CONTRACTS IN NEGOTIATION INCLUDE ANNUAL

LIVE PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS. IN THESE CASES, REVENUES SUBJECT

TO THE COMMITMENT, WHICH ARE COLLECTED RATABLY OVER THE YEAR,

ARE DEFERRED UNTIL THE ANNUAL COMMITMENTS ARE SATISFIED WHICH

GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION IN THE SECOND

HALF OF THE YEAR.

INCREASED BROADCASTING REVENUES WERE DUE TO

GROWTH AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION

AND DISTRIBUTION. ABC TELEVISION NETWORK REVENUES INCREASED

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER PRIMETIME ADVERTISING REVENUE RESULTING

FROM HIGHER RATINGS AND ADVERTISING RATES. THE GROWTH AT

TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER

LICENSE FEE REVENUES FROM DOMESTIC MARKETS AS A RESULT OF THE

SYNDICATION OF

MY WIFE AND KIDS

AND HIGHER REVENUE IN

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS FROM SALES OF

DESPERATE HOUSEWIVES

AND

LOST.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES, WHICH CONSIST PRIMARILY OF

PROGRAMMING RIGHTS COSTS, PRODUCTION COSTS, PARTICIPATION COSTS,

DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING EXPENSES, LABOR COSTS AND GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, INCREASED 9%, OR $849 MILLION, TO

$10.5 BILLION CONSISTING OF AN 11% INCREASE, OR

$491 MILLION, AT THE CABLE NETWORKS, AND A 7% INCREASE, OR

$358 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING. THE INCREASE AT CABLE

NETWORKS WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASES AT ESPN FROM HIGHER GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, INCREASED PRODUCTION COSTS AND

INVESTMENTS IN NEW BUSINESS INITIATIVES, INCLUDING ESPN BRANDED

MOBILE PHONE SERVICE. HIGHER GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES, PROGRAMMING EXPENSES AND MARKETING COSTS AT THE DISNEY

CHANNELS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE INCREASE AT CABLE NETWORKS. THE

INCREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER PRODUCTION AND

PARTICIPATION COSTS AT TV PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION. THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R INCREASED EXPENSES IN FISCAL YEAR

2005 AT CABLE NETWORKS AND AT BROADCASTING BY $36 MILLION

AND $64 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS

FOR THE PURCHASE OF TELEVISION RIGHTS FOR SPORTS AND OTHER

PROGRAMMING, INCLUDING THE NBA, NFL, MLB, AND VARIOUS COLLEGE

FOOTBALL AND BASKETBALL CONFERENCES AND FOOTBALL BOWL GAMES. THE

COSTS OF THESE CONTRACTS HAVE INCREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN RECENT

YEARS. WE ENTER INTO THESE CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS WITH THE

EXPECTATION THAT, OVER THE LIFE OF THE CONTRACTS, REVENUE FROM

ADVERTISING DURING THE PROGRAMMING AND AFFILIATE FEES WILL

EXCEED THE COSTS OF THE PROGRAMMING. WHILE CONTRACT COSTS MAY

INITIALLY EXCEED INCREMENTAL REVENUES AND NEGATIVELY IMPACT

OPERATING INCOME, IT IS OUR EXPECTATION THAT THE COMBINED VALUE

TO OUR NETWORKS FROM ALL OF THESE CONTRACTS WILL RESULT IN

LONG-TERM BENEFITS. THE ACTUAL IMPACT OF THESE CONTRACTS ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS IS

DEPENDENT UPON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF

ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE

SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES.

THE INITIAL FIVE-YEAR PERIOD OF THE

COMPANYS CONTRACT TO TELEVISE NFL GAMES WAS NON-CANCELABLE

AND ENDED WITH THE TELECAST OF THE 2003 PRO BOWL. IN FEBRUARY

2003, THE NFL DID NOT EXERCISE ITS RENEGOTIATION OPTION AND AS A

RESULT, THE COMPANYS NFL CONTRACT WAS EXTENDED FOR AN

ADDITIONAL THREE YEARS ENDING WITH THE TELECAST OF THE 2006 PRO

BOWL. THE AGGREGATE FEE FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD IS

$3.7 BILLION. ESPN RECOGNIZED ITS PORTION OF THE COSTS OF

THE INITIAL FIVE-YEAR TERM OF THE CONTRACT AT LEVELS THAT

INCREASED EACH YEAR COMMENSURATE WITH EXPECTED INCREASES IN NFL

REVENUES. AS A RESULT, ESPN EXPERIENCED ITS HIGHEST LEVEL OF NFL

PROGRAMMING COSTS DURING FISCAL 2003. THE IMPLEMENTATION

-38-

OF THE CONTRACT EXTENSION RESULTED IN A

$180 MILLION REDUCTION IN NFL PROGRAMMING COSTS AT ESPN IN

FISCAL 2004 AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003. THE MAJORITY OF THIS

DECREASE WAS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. THESE COSTS

$7.6 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF

$1.1 BILLION IN WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT. THE DECLINE

PRODUCT COSTS AND PARTICIPATION COSTS, DECREASED 8%, OR

$671 MILLION, DUE TO LOWER COSTS IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL

MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION AND IN WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT.

THE DECLINE IN COSTS AND EXPENSES AT WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL

DISTRIBUTION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND

LOWER PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION. DISTRIBUTION COSTS WERE

LOWER AS THE PRIOR YEAR INCLUDED HIGHER PROFILE FILMS THAT HAD

EXTENSIVE MARKETING CAMPAIGNS TO LAUNCH THE FILMS. THE DECREASE

IN PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER FILM COST

WRITE-OFFS. THESE COST DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASED PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS AT

MIRAMAX DUE TO AN INCREASED NUMBER OF RELEASES AND HIGHER

WRITE-OFFS. LOWER COSTS IN WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT WERE

PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DISTRIBUTION COSTS, PRODUCTION COST

AMORTIZATION AND PARTICIPATION COSTS. DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND

PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION WERE LOWER AS A RESULT OF DECREASED

UNIT SALES. PARTICIPATION COSTS WERE DOWN AS THE PRIOR YEAR

INCLUDED

FINDING NEMO

AND

PIRATES OF THE

CARIBBEAN

, WHICH HAD HIGHER PARTICIPATION COSTS DUE TO

BETTER PERFORMANCE THAN CURRENT YEAR TITLES. PIXAR RECEIVES AN

EQUAL SHARE OF PROFITS (AFTER DISTRIBUTION FEES) AS CO-PRODUCER

OF

FINDING NEMO

AND

THE INCREDIBLES.

THE ADOPTION

OF SFAS 123R INCREASED EXPENSES BY $41 MILLION IN

FISCAL YEAR 2005.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 69%, OR

$455 MILLION, TO $207 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER

OVERALL UNIT SALES IN WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND A DECLINE

AT MIRAMAX, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY BETTER PERFORMANCE IN WORLDWIDE

THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION.

MIRAMAX

IN MARCH 2005, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO

AGREEMENTS WITH MIRAMAX CO-CHAIRMEN, BOB AND HARVEY WEINSTEIN,

AND THEIR NEW PRODUCTION COMPANY. PURSUANT TO THOSE AGREEMENTS,

THE COMPANY, AMONG OTHER THINGS, SUBSTANTIALLY RESOLVED ALL

ECONOMIC ISSUES RELATING TO THE WEINSTEINS EXISTING

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS; TERMINATED THE WEINSTEINS EXISTING

EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS AND ENTERED INTO NEW EMPLOYMENT AGREEMENTS

OPPORTUNITY TO ACQUIRE CERTAIN DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS, AS WELL AS

SEQUEL RIGHTS TO CERTAIN LIBRARY PRODUCT. THE COMPANY RETAINS

CERTAIN CO-FINANCING, DISTRIBUTION AND PARTICIPATION RIGHTS IN

SEVERAL OF THESE PROPERTIES. THE COMPANY ALSO RETAINS THE

MIRAMAX AND DIMENSION FILM LIBRARIES AND THE NAME MIRAMAX

FILMS, WHILE THE WEINSTEINS HAVE TAKEN THE DIMENSION NAME

TO THEIR NEW COMPANY. NO MATERIAL CHARGES WERE RECORDED AS A

RESULT OF THE EXECUTION OF THE AGREEMENTS AND THE COMPANY DOES

NOT CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE THAT IT WILL INCUR MATERIAL CHARGES IN

CONNECTION WITH THE REMAINING MIRAMAX PROJECTS.

-41-

CONSUMER PRODUCTS

REVENUES

REVENUES DECREASED 15%, OR $384 MILLION, TO

$2.1 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE OF

$543 MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE SALE OF THE DISNEY STORE

NORTH AMERICA IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005. THIS DECREASE

WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES AT MERCHANDISE LICENSING AND

BUENA VISTA GAMES OF $118 MILLION AND $53 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCREASE IN MERCHANDISE LICENSING WAS DUE TO

HIGHER REVENUES ACROSS ALL LINES OF BUSINESS AND RECOGNITION OF

CONTRACTUAL MINIMUM GUARANTEE REVENUES WHICH INCREASED BY

$49 MILLION IN FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004. THE

INCREASE AT BUENA VISTA GAMES WAS DUE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF

THE INCREDIBLES

LICENSED PRODUCTS, RECOGNITION OF

CONTRACTUAL MINIMUM GUARANTEE REVENUE, WHICH INCREASED BY

$17 MILLION IN FISCAL 2005 COMPARED TO FISCAL 2004, AND

HIGHER SALES OF GAME BOY ADVANCE GAMES.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES DECREASED 19%, OR

$370 MILLION, TO $1.6 BILLION, DUE TO A DECREASE OF

$528 MILLION RELATED TO THE SALE OF THE DISNEY STORE NORTH

AMERICA CHAIN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

SPENDING AT BUENA VISTA GAMES, INCREASED OPERATING EXPENSES AT

MERCHANDISE LICENSING AND $20 MILLION OF STOCK OPTION

EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R IN FISCAL

YEAR 2005.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME DECREASED 3%, OR

$14 MILLION, TO $520 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER

OPERATING INCOME AT THE DISNEY STORE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GROWTH

IN MERCHANDISE LICENSING.

SOLD SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DISNEY STORE CHAIN IN NORTH

AMERICA UNDER A LONG-TERM LICENSING ARRANGEMENT TO A

WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE CHILDRENS PLACE (TCP). THE

COMPANY RECEIVED $100 MILLION FOR THE WORKING CAPITAL

TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER AT THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION.

DURING FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED A LOSS ON THE WORKING

CAPITAL THAT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER AND ADDITIONAL

RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE SALE

(PRIMARILY FOR EMPLOYEE RETENTION AND SEVERANCE AND LEASE

TERMINATION COSTS) TOTALING $32 MILLION. PURSUANT TO THE

FOR THE YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES.

AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASE CHARGES INCREASED AS A

RESULT OF THE WRITE-OFF OF OUR LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT WITH

DELTA AIR LINES, INC. (DELTA) AFTER DELTAS BANKRUPTCY

FILING IN SEPTEMBER 2005. IN FISCAL 2004, WE TOOK A PARTIAL

WRITE-DOWN OF OUR INVESTMENT WITH DELTA CONSISTENT WITH OUR

AGREEMENT WITH DELTA TO REDUCE LEASE PAYMENTS. IN THE EVENT OF A

MATERIAL MODIFICATION TO THE DELTA AIRCRAFT LEASES OR

FORECLOSURE OF THE DELTA AIRCRAFT BY THE DEBT HOLDERS, CERTAIN

TAX PAYMENTS OF UP TO $100 MILLION COULD BE ACCELERATED.

THE EXPECTED TAX PAYMENTS ARE CURRENTLY REFLECTED ON OUR BALANCE

IN A FURTHER CHARGE TO EARNINGS. AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2005, OUR

REMAINING AIRCRAFT LEVERAGE LEASE INVESTMENT TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $52 MILLION WITH FEDEX CORP.

THE CURRENT YEAR INTEREST AND INVESTMENT INCOME

INCLUDED $19 MILLION IN GAINS FROM THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS.

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

RELATED TO THE

REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS. EXCLUDING THESE BENEFITS, THE

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES WERE 35.1% AND 35.2% FOR FISCAL YEARS

2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. AS MORE FULLY DISCUSSED IN

NOTE 7 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE 2005

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE REFLECTS THE FIRST YEAR OF A

THREE-YEAR PHASE-OUT OF AN EXCLUSION FOR CERTAIN

EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO FOREIGN TRADING GROSS

RECEIPTS.

PENSION AND BENEFIT COSTS

PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLAN

COSTS AFFECT RESULTS IN ALL OF OUR SEGMENTS, WITH THE MAJORITY

OF THESE COSTS BEING BORNE BY THE PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT.

THESE COSTS DECREASED FROM $374 MILLION IN FISCAL 2004 TO

$314 MILLION IN FISCAL 2005. THE DECREASE IN FISCAL 2005

WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO

MEASURE THE PRESENT VALUE OF PLAN OBLIGATIONS. THE DISCOUNT RATE

ASSUMPTION INCREASED FROM 5.85% TO 6.30% REFLECTING TRENDS IN

PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES AT OUR JUNE 30, 2004

VALUATION DATE.

WE EXPECT PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL

COSTS TO INCREASE TO $462 MILLION IN FISCAL 2006. THE

INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE

ASSUMPTION FROM 6.30% TO 5.25%, REFLECTING DECREASES IN

PREVAILING MARKET INTEREST RATES ON OUR JUNE 30, 2005

VALUATION DATE. THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE FOR PENSION PLANS

REFLECTS THE MARKET RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS

DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES

CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE

BONDS. THE RESULTING DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN

LIABILITY CASH FLOWS TO THE YIELD CURVES.

DURING FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED

$303 MILLION TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL

PLANS WHICH INCLUDED VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM

REQUIREMENTS FOR THE PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY

EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE, AT A MINIMUM, $61 MILLION TO ITS

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS DURING FISCAL 2006. THE

COMPANY MAY MAKE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS INTO ITS PENSION PLANS

IN FISCAL 2006 DEPENDING ON HOW THE FUNDED STATUS OF THOSE PLANS

CHANGE

-44-

AND ALSO DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF PROPOSED

CHANGES TO THE FUNDING REGULATIONS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY

THE UNITED STATES CONGRESS.

DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF

PENSION OBLIGATIONS, PENSION OBLIGATIONS EXCEED PLAN ASSETS FOR

A NUMBER OF OUR PENSION PLANS. IN THIS SITUATION, THE ACCOUNTING

RULES REQUIRE THAT WE RECORD AN ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION

LIABILITY. THE ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT

AT YEAR END FISCAL 2005 AND FISCAL 2004 IS AS FOLLOWS.

THE INCREASE IN THE ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION

THE DISCOUNT RATE FROM 6.30% TO 5.25%. THE ACCOUNTING RULES DO

NOT REQUIRE THAT CHANGES IN THE ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION

LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT BE RECORDED IN CURRENT PERIOD EARNINGS, BUT

RATHER THEY ARE RECORDED DIRECTLY TO EQUITY THROUGH ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. EXPENSE RECOGNITION UNDER THE

MEDIA NETWORKS

REVENUES

MEDIA NETWORKS REVENUES INCREASED 8%, OR

$837 MILLION, TO $11.8 BILLION REFLECTING A 16%

INCREASE, OR $887 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS, AND A

DECREASE OF 1%, OR $50 MILLION, AT BROADCASTING.

INCREASED CABLE NETWORKS REVENUES WERE DRIVEN BY

INCREASES OF $696 MILLION IN REVENUES FROM CABLE AND

SATELLITE OPERATORS AND $236 MILLION IN ADVERTISING

REVENUES. INCREASED ADVERTISING REVENUE WAS PRIMARILY AT ESPN

DUE TO HIGHER ADVERTISING RATES AND AT ABC FAMILY DUE TO HIGHER

RATINGS. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES FROM CABLE AND SATELLITE

OPERATORS IN FISCAL 2004 REFLECTED BOTH CONTRACTUAL RATE

ADJUSTMENTS AND TO A LESSER EXTENT SUBSCRIBER GROWTH.

DECREASED BROADCASTING REVENUES WERE DRIVEN BY A

DECREASE OF $147 MILLION AT THE TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND

DISTRIBUTION BUSINESSES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE OF

$63 MILLION AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK. THE DECREASE IN

TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND DISTRIBUTION REVENUES WAS PRIMARILY

DUE TO LOWER SYNDICATION REVENUE AND LICENSE FEES. THE INCREASE

AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER ADVERTISING

REVENUES REFLECTING HIGHER RATES DUE TO AN IMPROVED ADVERTISING

MARKETPLACE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER RATINGS AND A DECREASE

DUE TO AIRING THE SUPER BOWL IN FISCAL 2003.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES DECREASED 1%, OR

$119 MILLION, TO $9.6 BILLION. THE DECREASE REFLECTED

LOWER COSTS AT BROADCASTING, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COSTS AT

CABLE. THE DECREASE AT BROADCASTING WAS DUE TO LOWER PROGRAMMING

COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PENSION AND OTHER

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS AS WELL AS HIGHER MOVIEBEAM OPERATING

COSTS. HIGHER COSTS AT CABLE REFLECTED INCREASED PROGRAMMING,

PENSION AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER BAD

DEBT EXPENSE.

LOWER PROGRAMMING COSTS AT BROADCASTING WERE

DRIVEN BY LOWER SPORTS PROGRAMMING COSTS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

AIRING OF THE SUPER BOWL IN FISCAL 2003, LOWER LICENSE FEES FOR

PRIMETIME SERIES AND FEWER PRIMETIME MOVIES. ADDITIONALLY,

FISCAL 2003 INCLUDED HIGHER NEWS PRODUCTION COSTS DUE TO THE

COVERAGE OF THE MILITARY CONFLICT IN IRAQ.

-45-

HIGHER PROGRAMMING COSTS AT CABLE NETWORKS WERE

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER RIGHTS AND PRODUCTION COSTS AT ESPN,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NFL AMORTIZATION DUE TO COMMENCING THE

THREE YEAR OPTION PERIOD AS DESCRIBED UNDER SPORTS

PROGRAMMING COSTS ABOVE. THE DECREASE IN BAD DEBT EXPENSE

AT THE CABLE NETWORKS REFLECTED THE FAVORABLE IMPACT OF A

BANKRUPTCY SETTLEMENT WITH A CABLE OPERATOR IN LATIN AMERICA IN

THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004.

COST RECOGNITION FOR NFL PROGRAMMING AT THE ABC

TELEVISION NETWORK IN FISCAL 2004 DECREASED BY $300 MILLION

AS COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003. THE DECREASE AT THE ABC TELEVISION

NETWORK IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF THE SUPER BOWL, WHICH

WAS AIRED IN FISCAL 2003, AS WELL AS FEWER GAMES IN FISCAL 2004.

THE ABSENCE OF THE SUPER BOWL AND THE LOWER NUMBER OF GAMES AT

THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK ALSO RESULTED IN LOWER REVENUE FROM

NFL BROADCASTS IN FISCAL 2004. CASH PAYMENTS UNDER THE CONTRACT

IN FISCAL 2004 TOTALED $1.2 BILLION AS COMPARED TO

$1.3 BILLION IN FISCAL 2003.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 79%, OR

$956 MILLION, TO $2.2 BILLION REFLECTING INCREASES OF

$748 MILLION AT THE CABLE NETWORKS AND $208 MILLION AT

BROADCASTING. GROWTH AT THE CABLE NETWORKS REFLECTED HIGHER

AFFILIATE REVENUES, HIGHER ADVERTISING REVENUE AND LOWER NFL

PROGRAMMING COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER RIGHTS AND

PRODUCTION COSTS AND HIGHER ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES. INCREASED

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AT BROADCASTING REFLECTED HIGHER

ADVERTISING REVENUES AT THE ABC TELEVISION NETWORK AND LOWER

PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTION COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

PARKS AND RESORTS

REVENUES

REVENUES AT PARKS AND RESORTS INCREASED 21%, OR

$1.3 BILLION, TO $7.8 BILLION. THE INCREASE WAS DRIVEN

BY INCREASES OF $715 MILLION DUE TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF

EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND (PRIMARILY EURO DISNEY),

$609 MILLION FROM THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT, AND

$95 MILLION FROM THE DISNEYLAND RESORT. THESE INCREASES

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $61 MILLION

RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF THE ANAHEIM ANGELS BASEBALL TEAM

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003.

AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT, INCREASED

REVENUES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER THEME PARK ATTENDANCE,

OCCUPIED ROOM NIGHTS, AND PER CAPITA SPENDING AT THE THEME

PARKS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PER ROOM GUEST SPENDING AT THE

HOTELS. HIGHER THEME PARK ATTENDANCE WAS DRIVEN BY INCREASED

RESIDENT, DOMESTIC, AND INTERNATIONAL GUEST VISITATION,

REFLECTING THE CONTINUED SUCCESS OF MISSION: SPACE,

MICKEYS PHILHARMAGIC AND DISNEYS POP CENTURY RESORT,

AND IMPROVEMENTS IN TRAVEL AND TOURISM. GUEST SPENDING DECREASES

AT THE HOTELS REFLECTED A HIGHER MIX OF HOTEL GUEST VISITATION

AT THE LOWER PRICED VALUE RESORTS.

AT THE DISNEYLAND RESORT, INCREASED REVENUES WERE

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER GUEST SPENDING AT THE THEME PARKS AND

HOTEL PROPERTIES.

-46-

ACROSS OUR DOMESTIC THEME PARKS, ATTENDANCE

INCREASED 7% AND PER CAPITA GUEST SPENDING INCREASED 6% COMPARED

TO FISCAL 2003. ATTENDANCE AND PER CAPITA GUEST SPENDING AT THE

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. PER ROOM GUEST SPENDING

CONSISTS OF THE AVERAGE DAILY HOTEL ROOM RATE AS WELL AS GUEST

SPENDING ON FOOD, BEVERAGES, AND MERCHANDISE AT THE HOTELS. THE

DECLINE IN PER ROOM GUEST SPENDING REFLECTS A HIGHER MIX OF

HOTEL GUEST VISITATION AT THE LOWER PRICED VALUE RESORTS.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES INCREASED 21%, OR

$1.2 BILLION, COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003. THE INCREASE IN

COSTS AND EXPENSES WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF

EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND, WHICH INCREASED COSTS AND

EXPENSES BY $651 MILLION, AS WELL AS HIGHER OPERATING COSTS

AT BOTH DOMESTIC RESORTS. HIGHER OPERATING COSTS WERE DRIVEN BY

VOLUME INCREASES AS WELL AS HIGHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, MARKETING

AND SALES COSTS, DEPRECIATION EXPENSE, AND INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY COSTS. HIGHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS COSTS REFLECTED

INCREASED PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT MEDICAL COSTS, WHICH GREW

$137 MILLION AT THE DOMESTIC RESORTS. HIGHER MARKETING

COSTS WERE DRIVEN BY THE OPENING OF MISSION: SPACE

AT EPCOT AND DISNEYS POP CENTURY RESORT AT WALT DISNEY

WORLD, AND BY THE TWILIGHT ZONE

TM

TOWER OF TERROR AND

THE 50TH ANNIVERSARY CELEBRATION AT DISNEYLAND. HIGHER

DEPRECIATION REFLECTS NEW RESORT PROPERTIES AND THEME PARK

ATTRACTIONS AS WELL AS NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS. THESE

INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COST DECREASES DUE TO THE

SALE OF THE ANAHEIM ANGELS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL

2003.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 17%, OR

$166 MILLION, TO $1.1 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO GROWTH

AT THE WALT DISNEY WORLD RESORT AND THE CONSOLIDATION OF EURO

DISNEY WHICH CONTRIBUTED $75 MILLION OF THE INCREASE IN

OPERATING INCOME.

STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT

REVENUES

REVENUES INCREASED 18%, OR $1.3 BILLION, TO

$8.7 BILLION, DUE TO INCREASES OF $1.4 BILLION IN

WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND $151 MILLION IN TELEVISION

DISTRIBUTION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF

$215 MILLION IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE

DISTRIBUTION.

WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT REVENUES INCREASED

DUE TO HIGHER DVD UNIT SALES IN FISCAL 2004, WHICH INCLUDED

DISNEY/ PIXARS

FINDING NEMO, PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN,

THE LION KING

PLATINUM RELEASE AND

BROTHER BEAR

COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003, WHICH INCLUDED

LILO &

STITCH

AND

BEAUTY AND THE BEAST

. REVENUES IN

TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER PAY TELEVISION

SALES DUE TO BETTER PERFORMANCES OF LIVE-ACTION TITLES.

WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION REVENUE

DECREASED

-47-

DUE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF FISCAL 2004 TITLES,

WHICH INCLUDED

HOME ON THE RANGE, THE ALAMO

AND

KING

ARTHUR

, WHICH FACED DIFFICULT COMPARISONS TO THE STRONG

PERFORMANCES OF FISCAL 2003 TITLES, WHICH INCLUDED

FINDING

NEMO

(DOMESTICALLY) AND

PIRATES OF THE

CARIBBEAN

. PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THE DECREASE WAS THE

SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE OF

FINDING NEMO

INTERNATIONALLY IN

FISCAL 2004.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

COSTS AND EXPENSES INCREASED 19%, OR

$1.3 BILLION, COMPARED TO FISCAL 2003. HIGHER COSTS AND

EXPENSES WERE DUE TO INCREASES IN WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT

AND WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION. HIGHER

COSTS AND EXPENSES IN WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT REFLECTED

HIGHER DISTRIBUTION COSTS AND PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION FOR

FISCAL 2004 TITLES, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASED UNIT SALES

VOLUME FOR

FINDING NEMO

AND

PIRATES OF THE

CARIBBEAN

. IN ADDITION, PARTICIPATION EXPENSE WAS HIGHER IN

FISCAL 2004 BECAUSE OF PARTICIPATION ARRANGEMENTS WITH

FINDING NEMO

AND

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN

. HIGHER

COSTS IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL MOTION PICTURE DISTRIBUTION WERE

DUE TO INCREASED DISTRIBUTION COSTS FOR FISCAL 2004 TITLES,

WHICH INCLUDED

KING ARTHUR, BROTHER BEAR

AND

THE

VILLAGE

, AND INCREASED PRODUCTION COST AMORTIZATION,

INCLUDING HIGHER FILM COST WRITE-DOWNS, FOR FISCAL 2004 TITLES

WHICH INCLUDED

HOME ON THE RANGE

AND

THE ALAMO.

THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PRODUCTION AND

DEVELOPMENT WRITE-OFFS AND LOWER PARTICIPATION EXPENSE AS FISCAL

2003 INCLUDED PARTICIPATION PAYMENTS FOR THE DOMESTIC THEATRICAL

RELEASE OF

FINDING NEMO

AND THE WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL

RELEASE OF

PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN

. COST AND EXPENSES

FOR TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION WERE COMPARABLE YEAR OVER YEAR.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 7%, OR

$42 MILLION, TO $662 MILLION, DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN

WORLDWIDE HOME ENTERTAINMENT AND TELEVISION DISTRIBUTION,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECLINES IN WORLDWIDE THEATRICAL MOTION

PICTURE DISTRIBUTION.

CONSUMER PRODUCTS

REVENUES

REVENUES INCREASED 7%, OR $167 MILLION, TO

$2.5 BILLION, REFLECTING INCREASES OF $73 MILLION IN

MERCHANDISE LICENSING, $72 MILLION IN PUBLISHING AND

$28 MILLION AT THE DISNEY STORE.

HIGHER MERCHANDISE LICENSING REVENUES WERE DUE TO

HIGHER SALES OF HARDLINES, SOFTLINES AND TOYS WHICH WERE DRIVEN

BY THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

DISNEY PRINCESS

AND CERTAIN

FILM PROPERTIES. THE INCREASE AT PUBLISHING PRIMARILY REFLECTED

THE STRONG PERFORMANCE OF

FINDING NEMO

AND OTHER

CHILDRENS BOOKS AND

W.I.T.C.H.

MAGAZINE AND BOOK TITLES

ACROSS ALL REGIONS.

COSTS AND EXPENSES

OVERALL COSTS AND EXPENSES WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT

AT $2.0 BILLION. COSTS AND EXPENSES REFLECTED DECREASES AT

THE DISNEY STORE DUE PRIMARILY TO OVERHEAD SAVINGS AND THE

CLOSURE OF UNDERPERFORMING STORES, OFFSET BY VOLUME RELATED

INCREASES AT PUBLISHING AND HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES RELATED TO

MERCHANDISE LICENSING.

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 39%, OR

$150 MILLION, TO $534 MILLION, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY AN

INCREASE OF $117 MILLION AT THE DISNEY STORE DUE PRIMARILY

TO OVERHEAD SAVINGS AND THE CLOSURE OF UNDERPERFORMING STORES AS

WELL AS MARGIN IMPROVEMENTS. IMPROVEMENTS IN MERCHANDISE

LICENSING AND PUBLISHING ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO OPERATING INCOME

GROWTH.

THESE BANK FACILITIES ALLOW FOR BORROWINGS AT

COMPANYS PUBLIC DEBT RATING AND CAN RANGE FROM 0.175% TO

0.575%. AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD NOT BORROWED

UNDER THESE BANK FACILITIES. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS THE ABILITY TO

ISSUE UP TO $500 MILLION OF LETTERS OF CREDIT UNDER THE

FACILITY EXPIRING IN 2009, WHICH IF UTILIZED, REDUCES AVAILABLE

BORROWING. AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2005, LETTERS OF CREDIT IN AN

AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF $210 MILLION HAD BEEN ISSUED UNDER THIS

FACILITY.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO USE COMMERCIAL PAPER

BORROWINGS UP TO THE AMOUNT OF ITS UNUSED BANK FACILITIES, IN

CONJUNCTION WITH TERM-DEBT ISSUANCE AND OPERATING CASH FLOW, TO

RETIRE OR REFINANCE OTHER BORROWINGS BEFORE OR AS THEY COME DUE.

ON JANUARY 18, 2005, THE COMPANY FILED A

SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WHICH ALLOWS THE COMPANY TO BORROW

UP TO $5 BILLION USING VARIOUS TYPES OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS

SUCH AS FIXED OR FLOATING RATE NOTES, U.S. DOLLAR OR

FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED NOTES, REDEEMABLE NOTES, GLOBAL

NOTES AND DUAL CURRENCY OR OTHER INDEXED NOTES. THE COMPANY

SUBSEQUENTLY ESTABLISHED A DOMESTIC MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM

UNDER THIS SHELF REGISTRATION, WHICH PERMITS ISSUANCE OF

$5 BILLION OF DEBT INSTRUMENTS, OF WHICH NONE HAVE BEEN

ISSUED AT OCTOBER 1, 2005. IN ADDITION TO THE SHELF, THE

COMPANY ALSO HAS A EUROPEAN MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM, WHICH

PERMITS ISSUANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL

DEBT INSTRUMENTS, OF WHICH $0.2 BILLION HAS BEEN UTILIZED

AT OCTOBER 1, 2005.

THE COMPANY DECLARED AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF

$0.27 PER SHARE ON DECEMBER 1, 2005 RELATED TO FISCAL

2005. THE DIVIDEND IS PAYABLE ON JANUARY 6, 2006 TO

SHAREHOLDERS OF RECORD ON DECEMBER 12, 2005. THE COMPANY

PAID A $490 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.24 PER SHARE) DURING

THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005 APPLICABLE TO FISCAL 2004;

PAID A $430 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.21 PER SHARE) DURING

THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004 APPLICABLE TO FISCAL 2003; AND

PAID A $429 MILLION DIVIDEND ($0.21 PER SHARE) DURING

THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003 APPLICABLE TO FISCAL 2002.

DURING FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED

91 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR

$2.4 BILLION. DURING FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED

15 MILLION SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK FOR APPROXIMATELY

$335 MILLION. NO SHARES OF DISNEY COMMON STOCK WERE

REPURCHASED DURING FISCAL 2003. AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2005, THE

COMPANY HAD AUTHORIZATION TO REPURCHASE APPROXIMATELY

225 MILLION ADDITIONAL SHARES, OF WHICH THE COMPANY HAS

REPURCHASED 47 MILLION SHARES FOR $1.1 BILLION

SUBSEQUENT TO YEAR-END THROUGH DECEMBER 2, 2005.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION IS STRONG AND THAT ITS CASH BALANCES, OTHER LIQUID

ASSETS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS, ACCESS TO DEBT AND EQUITY CAPITAL

MARKETS AND BORROWING CAPACITY, TAKEN TOGETHER, PROVIDE ADEQUATE

RESOURCES TO FUND ONGOING OPERATING REQUIREMENTS AND FUTURE

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF EXISTING

BUSINESSES AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROJECTS. HOWEVER, THE

COMPANYS OPERATING CASH FLOW AND ACCESS TO THE CAPITAL

MARKETS CAN BE IMPACTED BY MACROECONOMIC FACTORS OUTSIDE OF ITS

CONTROL. IN ADDITION TO MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, THE

COMPANYS BORROWING COSTS CAN BE IMPACTED BY SHORT AND

LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING

-53-

AGENCIES, WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART,

ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CERTAIN CREDIT

METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. AS OF

OCTOBER 1, 2005, MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICES LONG

AND SHORT-TERM DEBT RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE BAAL AND P-2,

RESPECTIVELY, WITH POSITIVE OUTLOOK FOR THE LONG-TERM RATING;

AND STANDARD & POORS LONG AND SHORT-TERM DEBT

RATINGS FOR THE COMPANY WERE A- AND A-2, RESPECTIVELY, WITH

STABLE OUTLOOK. THE COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES CONTAIN ONLY

ONE FINANCIAL COVENANT, RELATING TO INTEREST COVERAGE, WHICH THE

COMPANY MET ON OCTOBER 1, 2005, BY A SIGNIFICANT MARGIN.

THE COMPANYS BANK FACILITIES ALSO SPECIFICALLY EXCLUDE

CERTAIN ENTITIES, INCLUDING EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG

DISNEYLAND, FROM ANY REPRESENTATIONS, COVENANTS OR EVENTS OF

DEFAULT.

HONG KONG DISNEYLAND IS SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL

COVENANTS UNDER ITS LOAN AGREEMENTS BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR

2006. EURO DISNEY HAS COVENANTS UNDER ITS DEBT AGREEMENTS THAT

LIMIT ITS INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES. BEGINNING WITH

FISCAL YEAR 2006, EURO DISNEY MUST MEET FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

COVENANTS THAT WILL NECESSITATE EARNINGS GROWTH. MANAGEMENT

CURRENTLY EXPECTS OPERATING RESULTS TO BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET

THESE COVENANTS. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE FOREGOING

FINANCIAL COVENANTS WILL BE MET AT ANY GIVEN TIME IN THE FUTURE.

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS, COMMITMENTS AND OFF

BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

WHICH ARE RECORDED AS LIABILITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS AND

CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY ALSO HAS CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENTS THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO MAKE PAYMENTS OR

PROVIDE FUNDING IF CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES OCCUR (CONTINGENT

COMMITMENTS). THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT THAT

THESE CONTINGENT COMMITMENTS WILL RESULT IN ANY AMOUNTS BEING

PAID BY THE COMPANY.

CONTRACTUAL GUARANTEES

SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING THE COMPANYS

CONTRACTUAL GUARANTEES.

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OUTSOURCING

DURING THE YEAR, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO

AGREEMENTS WITH TWO SUPPLIERS TO OUTSOURCE CERTAIN INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY FUNCTIONS AND SUPPORT SERVICES. THE TRANSITION OF

SERVICES TO THE NEW SUPPLIERS BEGAN IN LATE JULY 2005. THE TERMS

OF THESE AGREEMENTS EXTEND FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS WITH AN OPTION

FOR THE COMPANY TO EXTEND FOR AN ADDITIONAL TWO TO THREE YEARS.

THE COMPANY WILL RETAIN ALL RESPONSIBILITY AND AUTHORITY FOR

SYSTEMS ARCHITECTURE, TECHNOLOGY STRATEGY, AND PRODUCT STANDARDS

UNDER THE AGREEMENTS. PAYMENTS UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS ARE

EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE ABOVE BECAUSE THE PAYMENTS VARY

DEPENDING ON USAGE, BUT THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES SPENDING

APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION FOR THESE SERVICES OVER THE NEXT

SEVEN YEARS, WHICH IS LESS THAN WHAT WE ESTIMATE WE WOULD HAVE

SPENT HAD WE NOT OUTSOURCED THESE FUNCTIONS.

DVD MANUFACTURING ARRANGEMENT

THE COMPANY HAS A SOLE-SOURCE ARRANGEMENT IN THE

UNITED STATES AND A NUMBER OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETS WITH A

THIRD-PARTY MANUFACTURER TO MEET THE COMPANYS DVD

MANUFACTURING AND WAREHOUSING REQUIREMENTS WHICH EXPIRES

DECEMBER 31, 2006. PAYMENTS UNDER THIS ARRANGEMENT ARE

EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE ABOVE SINCE THERE ARE NEITHER FIXED NOR

MINIMUM QUANTITIES UNDER THE ARRANGEMENT. TOTAL PAYMENTS FOR

FISCAL 2005 WERE APPROXIMATELY $0.7 BILLION.

LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS

AS DISCLOSED IN NOTES 7 AND 13 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS EXPOSURE FOR

CERTAIN LEGAL AND TAX MATTERS.

ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND ESTIMATES

WE BELIEVE THAT THE APPLICATION OF THE FOLLOWING

ACCOUNTING POLICIES, WHICH ARE IMPORTANT TO OUR FINANCIAL

POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES ON THE PART OF MANAGEMENT. FOR A SUMMARY

OF OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES, INCLUDING THE ACCOUNTING

POLICIES DISCUSSED BELOW, SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

-55-

FILM AND TELEVISION REVENUES AND

COSTS

WE EXPENSE THE COST OF FILM AND TELEVISION

PRODUCTION AND PARTICIPATIONS AS WELL AS CERTAIN MULTI-YEAR

SPORTS RIGHTS OVER THE APPLICABLE PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE BASED UPON

THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO THE

ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS REVENUES OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

BASIS, AS APPROPRIATE. THESE ESTIMATES ARE CALCULATED ON AN

INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION BASIS FOR FILM AND TELEVISION AND ON AN

INDIVIDUAL CONTRACT BASIS FOR SPORTS RIGHTS. ESTIMATES OF TOTAL

GROSS REVENUES CAN CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO A VARIETY OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING ADVERTISING RATES, THE LEVEL OF MARKET

ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCTION AND TRENDS IN CONSUMER BEHAVIOR.

FOR FILM PRODUCTIONS, ESTIMATED REMAINING GROSS

REVENUE FROM ALL SOURCES INCLUDES REVENUE THAT WILL BE EARNED

WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE.

FOR TELEVISION SERIES, WE INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE EARNED

WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR IF

STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY OF THE

MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER. FOR ACQUIRED FILM LIBRARIES,

REMAINING REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO BE EARNED FOR UP TO TWENTY

YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.

TELEVISION NETWORK AND STATION RIGHTS FOR

THEATRICAL MOVIES, SERIES AND OTHER PROGRAMS ARE CHARGED TO

EXPENSE BASED ON THE NUMBER OF TIMES THE PROGRAM IS EXPECTED TO

BE SHOWN. ESTIMATES OF USAGE OF TELEVISION NETWORK AND STATION

PROGRAMMING CAN CHANGE BASED ON COMPETITION AND AUDIENCE

ACCEPTANCE. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE ESTIMATES AND PLANNED USAGE ARE

REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND ARE REVISED IF NECESSARY. A CHANGE IN

REVENUE PROJECTIONS OR PLANNED USAGE COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COSTS OF FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND

PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR OUR TELEVISION AND CABLE NETWORKS ARE

SUBJECT TO VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS PURSUANT TO APPLICABLE

ACCOUNTING RULES. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF THE TELEVISION

BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE REVIEWED USING A

DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF

PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS

OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE: EARLY

MORNING, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN AND

SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES

OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ASSETS ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED

BASIS FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL. ESTIMATED VALUES ARE BASED UPON

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT FUTURE DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS. IF ACTUAL

DEMAND OR MARKET CONDITIONS ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN OUR

PROJECTIONS, FILM, TELEVISION AND PROGRAMMING COST WRITE-DOWNS

MAY BE REQUIRED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

THE COMPANY HAS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES FOR

ITS VARIOUS OPERATING SEGMENTS, WHICH ARE APPROPRIATE TO THE

CIRCUMSTANCES OF EACH BUSINESS. SEE NOTE 2 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR A SUMMARY OF THESE REVENUE

RECOGNITION POLICIES.

WE RECORD REDUCTIONS TO REVENUES FOR ESTIMATED

FUTURE RETURNS OF MERCHANDISE, PRIMARILY HOME VIDEO, DVD AND

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, AND FOR CUSTOMER PROGRAMS AND SALES

INCENTIVES. THESE ESTIMATES ARE BASED UPON HISTORICAL RETURN

EXPERIENCE, CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS AND PROJECTIONS OF CUSTOMER

DEMAND FOR AND ACCEPTANCE OF OUR PRODUCTS. IF WE UNDERESTIMATE

THE LEVEL OF RETURNS IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD, WE MAY RECORD LESS

REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN RETURNS EXCEED THE PREDICTED

AMOUNT. CONVERSELY, IF WE OVERESTIMATE THE LEVEL OF RETURNS FOR

A PERIOD, WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL REVENUE IN LATER PERIODS WHEN

RETURNS ARE LESS THAN PREDICTED.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES ARE

RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. FOR NON-EXPIRING,

MULTI-DAY TICKETS AND TICKETS SOLD THROUGH BULK DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE PATTERNS

WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS. A CHANGE IN

THESE ESTIMATED USAGE PATTERNS COULD HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE

TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION.

-56-

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS

THE COMPANYS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED COSTS ARE CALCULATED

USING ACTUARIAL CONCEPTS, WITHIN THE FRAMEWORK OF STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 87

EMPLOYERS

ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS

AND STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 106,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING

FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS,

RESPECTIVELY. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND

THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF

EXPENSE AND/OR LIABILITY MEASUREMENT. WE EVALUATE THESE CRITICAL

ASSUMPTIONS ANNUALLY. OTHER ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE THE HEALTHCARE

COST TREND RATE AND EMPLOYEE DEMOGRAPHIC FACTORS SUCH AS

RETIREMENT PATTERNS, MORTALITY, TURNOVER AND RATE OF

COMPENSATION INCREASE.

THE DISCOUNT RATE ENABLES US TO STATE EXPECTED

FUTURE CASH PAYMENTS FOR BENEFITS AS A PRESENT VALUE ON THE

MEASUREMENT DATE. THE GUIDELINE FOR SETTING THIS RATE IS A

HIGH-QUALITY LONG-TERM CORPORATE BOND RATE. A LOWER DISCOUNT

RATE INCREASES THE PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND

INCREASES PENSION EXPENSE. WE DECREASED OUR DISCOUNT RATE TO

5.25% IN 2005 FROM 6.30% IN 2004 TO REFLECT MARKET INTEREST RATE

CONDITIONS AT OUR JUNE 30, 2005 MEASUREMENT DATE. THE

ASSUMED DISCOUNT RATE FOR PENSION PLANS REFLECTS THE MARKET

RATES FOR HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE

COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE

AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE

POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING

DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS

TO THE YIELD CURVES. A ONE PERCENT DECREASE IN THE ASSUMED

DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE TOTAL NET PERIODIC PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE FOR FISCAL 2006 BY

$167 MILLION AND WOULD INCREASE THE PROJECTED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION AT OCTOBER 1, 2005 BY $1.1 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENT INCREASE IN THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT

RATE WOULD DECREASE THESE AMOUNTS BY $139 MILLION AND

$919 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

TO DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS, WE CONSIDER THE CURRENT AND EXPECTED

ASSET ALLOCATION, AS WELL AS HISTORICAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON

EACH PLAN ASSET CLASS. A LOWER EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON

PENSION PLAN ASSETS WILL INCREASE PENSION EXPENSE. OUR LONG-TERM

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 7.50% IN BOTH 2005 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY. A ONE PERCENT CHANGE IN THE LONG-TERM RETURN ON

PENSION PLAN ASSET ASSUMPTION WOULD IMPACT FISCAL 2006 ANNUAL

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY

$36 MILLION. SEE NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

GOODWILL, INTANGIBLE ASSETS, LONG-LIVED ASSETS

AND INVESTMENTS

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(SFAS 142) REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. WE COMPLETED

OUR IMPAIRMENT TESTING AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2005 AND DETERMINED

THAT THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RELATED TO GOODWILL AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF EMERGING

ISSUES TASK FORCE TOPIC D-108,

USE OF THE RESIDUAL METHOD TO

VALUE ACQUIRED ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL

(EITF D-108), AS

DESCRIBED UNDER ACCOUNTING CHANGES BELOW. IN

ASSESSING THE RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, MARKET VALUES AND PROJECTIONS REGARDING ESTIMATED FUTURE

CASH FLOWS AND OTHER FACTORS ARE USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE ASSETS. IF THESE ESTIMATES OR RELATED

PROJECTIONS CHANGE IN THE FUTURE, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR THESE ASSETS.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE

FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT ON AN

ANNUAL BASIS TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN

ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT

THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS

LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS GOODWILL. FOR PURPOSES OF

PERFORMING THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR GOODWILL AS REQUIRED BY

SFAS 142 WE ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING REPORTING UNITS.

CABLE NETWORKS, TELEVISION BROADCASTING, RADIO, STUDIO

ENTERTAINMENT, CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND PARKS AND RESORTS.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING

UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND

AS APPROPRIATE, EXCEPT

-57-

FOR THE TELEVISION NETWORK, A BUSINESS WITHIN THE

TELEVISION BROADCASTING REPORTING UNIT. THE TELEVISION

BROADCASTING REPORTING UNIT INCLUDES THE TELEVISION NETWORK AND

THE OWNED AND OPERATED TELEVISION STATIONS. THESE BUSINESSES

HAVE BEEN GROUPED TOGETHER BECAUSE THEIR RESPECTIVE CASH FLOWS

ARE DEPENDENT ON ONE ANOTHER. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR IMPAIRMENT

TEST, WE USED A REVENUE MULTIPLE TO VALUE THE TELEVISION

NETWORK. WE DID NOT USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE OR A MARKET

MULTIPLE APPROACH TO VALUE THE TELEVISION NETWORK AS A PRESENT

VALUE TECHNIQUE WOULD NOT CAPTURE THE FULL FAIR VALUE OF THE

TELEVISION NETWORK AND THERE IS LITTLE COMPARABLE MARKET DATA

AVAILABLE DUE TO THE SCARCITY OF TELEVISION NETWORKS. WE APPLIED

WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION METHODOLOGY

FOR EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS. IF WE HAD ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT

REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT VALUATION METHODOLOGIES,

THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD DIFFER.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE

FAIR VALUE OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS

CARRYING AMOUNT. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS

RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS,

MARKET MULTIPLES OR APPRAISED VALUES AS APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY HAS COST AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS. THE

FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE

OF THE INVESTEE COMPANIES, AS WELL AS VOLATILITY INHERENT IN THE

EXTERNAL MARKETS FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. IN ASSESSING POTENTIAL

IMPAIRMENT FOR THESE INVESTMENTS, WE CONSIDER THESE FACTORS AS

WELL AS FORECASTED FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF OUR INVESTEES. IF

THESE FORECASTS ARE NOT MET, IMPAIRMENT CHARGES MAY BE REQUIRED.

CONTINGENCIES AND LITIGATION

WE ARE CURRENTLY INVOLVED IN CERTAIN LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS AND, AS REQUIRED, HAVE ACCRUED ESTIMATES OF THE

PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LOSSES FOR THE RESOLUTION OF THESE

CLAIMS. THESE ESTIMATES HAVE BEEN DEVELOPED IN CONSULTATION WITH

OUTSIDE COUNSEL AND ARE BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF POTENTIAL

RESULTS, ASSUMING A COMBINATION OF LITIGATION AND SETTLEMENT

STRATEGIES. IT IS POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, THAT FUTURE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD COULD

BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR STRATEGIES RELATED TO THESE PROCEEDINGS.

SEE NOTE 13 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

MORE DETAILED INFORMATION ON LITIGATION EXPOSURE.

INCOME TAX AUDITS

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY

AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME

TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY REACHED SETTLEMENTS

WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE REGARDING ALL ASSESSMENTS

PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO ITS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 1996

THROUGH 2000, AND A SETTLEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX

BOARD REGARDING ASSESSMENTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO ITS STATE

TAX RETURNS FOR 1994 THROUGH 2003. THESE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENTS

RESULTED IN THE COMPANY RELEASING $102 MILLION IN TAX

RESERVES WHICH ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO THESE

MATTERS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY

REACHED A SETTLEMENT WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE REGARDING

ALL ASSESSMENTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO ITS FEDERAL INCOME TAX

RETURNS FOR 1993 THROUGH 1995. THE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT RESULTED

IN THE COMPANY RELEASING $120 MILLION IN TAX RESERVES THAT

ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO THESE MATTERS. DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY FAVORABLY RESOLVED

CERTAIN STATE INCOME TAX AUDIT ISSUES AND RELEASED

$56 MILLION OF RELATED TAX RESERVES.

STOCK OPTION COMPENSATION EXPENSE

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR STOCK OPTIONS IS

ESTIMATED ON THE GRANT DATE USING A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION-PRICING

MODEL. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE

BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL WERE 4.75, 6.0 AND 6.0 YEARS FOR THE

EXPECTED TERM AND 27%, 40% AND 40% FOR THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY

FOR FISCAL YEARS 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. FUTURE

EXPENSE AMOUNTS FOR ANY PARTICULAR QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL PERIOD

COULD BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN OUR ASSUMPTIONS OR CHANGES IN

MARKET CONDITIONS.

-58-

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R

(SEE NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS), THE

COMPANY REVIEWED AND UPDATED, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ITS

FORFEITURE, EXPECTED TERM AND VOLATILITY ASSUMPTIONS. THE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED OPTION TERM FOR 2005 REFLECTS THE

APPLICATION OF THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD SET OUT IN SEC STAFF

ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 107 (SAB 107), WHICH WAS

ISSUED IN MARCH 2005. THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD DEFINES THE LIFE AS

THE AVERAGE OF THE CONTRACTUAL TERM OF THE OPTIONS AND THE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE VESTING PERIOD FOR ALL OPTION TRANCHES.

ESTIMATED VOLATILITY FOR FISCAL 2005 ALSO

REFLECTS THE APPLICATION OF SAB 107 INTERPRETIVE GUIDANCE

AND, ACCORDINGLY, INCORPORATES HISTORICAL AND IMPLIED

SHARE-PRICE VOLATILITY, WITH IMPLIED VOLATILITY DERIVED FROM

EXCHANGE TRADED OPTIONS ON THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK AND

OTHER TRADED FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS THE COMPANYS

CONVERTIBLE DEBT. VOLATILITY FOR 2004 AND 2003 WAS ESTIMATED

BASED UPON HISTORICAL SHARE-PRICE VOLATILITY. SEE NOTE 10

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR MORE DETAILED

INFORMATION.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

SFAS 123R

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY

ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

NO. 123R,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(SFAS 123R),

WHICH REVISES SFAS 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION

AND SUPERSEDES ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD

OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

(APB 25). SFAS 123R REQUIRES THAT NEW, MODIFIED

AND UNVESTED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS WITH EMPLOYEES,

SUCH AS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK, BE RECOGNIZED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUE AND RECOGNIZED AS

COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY

ADOPTED SFAS 123R EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2004, USING THE

MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. THIS METHOD ALLOWS THE

RESTATEMENT OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE YEAR OF

ADOPTION BASED ON THE AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY CALCULATED AND REPORTED

IN THE PRO FORMA FOOTNOTE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY SFAS 123.

HOWEVER, FISCAL YEARS PRIOR TO 2005 HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED. THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R IN FISCAL 2005 RESULTED IN THE

RECOGNITION OF STOCK OPTION EXPENSE OF $253 MILLION AND

$53 MILLION OF NET CAPITALIZED COMPENSATION COSTS, A

REDUCTION IN NET INCOME OF $160 MILLION (NET OF TAX

BENEFITS OF $93 MILLION), A REDUCTION IN BASIC AND DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $0.08, A REDUCTION OF $24 MILLION IN

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND AN INCREASE OF

$24 MILLION IN CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE

(EITF) ISSUED TOPIC NO. D-108,

USE OF THE RESIDUAL

METHOD TO VALUE ACQUIRED ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL

(EITF

D-108). EITF D-108 REQUIRES THAT A DIRECT VALUE METHOD BE USED

TO VALUE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

COMPLETED AFTER SEPTEMBER 29, 2004. EITF D-108 ALSO

REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT TEST USING A

DIRECT VALUE METHOD ON ALL INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT WERE

PREVIOUSLY VALUED USING THE RESIDUAL METHOD. ANY IMPAIRMENTS

ARISING FROM THE INITIAL APPLICATION OF A DIRECT VALUE METHOD

ARE REPORTED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE. FOR

RADIO STATION ACQUISITIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE ACQUISITION OF

CAPITAL CITIES/ ABC, INC. IN 1996, THE COMPANY APPLIED THE

RESIDUAL VALUE METHOD TO VALUE THE ACQUIRED FCC LICENSES. WE

ADOPTED EITF D-108 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 1,

2005 AND RECORDED

-60-

A NON-CASH, $57 MILLION PRE-TAX CHARGE

($36 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF

ACCOUNTING CHANGE.

SFAS 152 AND SOP 04-2

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 152,

ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE

TIME-SHARING TRANSACTIONS

(SFAS 152). THE FASB ISSUED

THIS STATEMENT AS A RESULT OF GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN AMERICAN

INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS STATEMENT OF POSITION

04-2,

ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE TIME-SHARING TRANSACTIONS

(SOP 04-2), WHICH APPLIES TO ALL REAL ESTATE TIME-SHARING

TRANSACTIONS. SFAS 152 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS

BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2005. WE EXPECT THAT THE IMPACT OF

ADOPTION WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FIN 46R

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION

NO. 46R,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(FIN 46R). VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) ARE

GENERALLY ENTITIES THAT LACK SUFFICIENT EQUITY TO FINANCE THEIR

ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER

PARTIES OR WHOSE EQUITY HOLDERS LACK ADEQUATE DECISION MAKING

ABILITY. ALL VIES WITH WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED MUST BE

EVALUATED TO DETERMINE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE RISKS AND

REWARDS OF THE VIE. THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IS REQUIRED TO

CONSOLIDATE THE VIE FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46R,

THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND

ARE VIES AND THAT WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. AS A RESULT,

THE COMPANY BEGAN CONSOLIDATING EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG

DISNEYLANDS BALANCE SHEETS ON MARCH 31, 2004, THE END

OF THE COMPANYS SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, AND THE

INCOME AND CASH FLOW STATEMENTS BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2004,

THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. UNDER

FIN 46R TRANSITION RULES, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF EURO

DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND CONTINUED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON

THE EQUITY METHOD FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004.

SEE NOTE 4 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE REST OF OUR EQUITY

INVESTMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION AS EITHER THEY ARE NOT

VIES, OR IN THE EVENT THAT THEY ARE VIES, WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN CERTAIN

OTHER VIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CONSOLIDATED BECAUSE THE COMPANY

IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THESE VIES DO NOT INVOLVE ANY

MATERIAL EXPOSURE TO THE COMPANY.

EITF 00-21

THE COMPANY ADOPTED EITF NO. 00-21,

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES

(EITF 00-21), EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL

2003. EITF 00-21 ADDRESSES REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR REVENUES

DERIVED FROM A SINGLE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT THAT CONTAINS

MULTIPLE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. THE RULE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL

REQUIREMENTS TO DETERMINE WHEN SUCH REVENUES MAY BE RECORDED

SEPARATELY FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. PREVIOUSLY, THE COMPANY HAD

RECOGNIZED THE NFL BROADCAST PORTION OF ESPNS AFFILIATE

REVENUE WHEN THE NFL GAMES WERE AIRED, AS ESPNS AFFILIATE

CONTRACTS PROVIDED A BASIS FOR ALLOCATING SUCH REVENUE BETWEEN

NFL AND NON-NFL PROGRAMMING. SINCE THE COST OF THE NFL RIGHTS

HAD ALSO BEEN RECOGNIZED AS THE GAMES WERE AIRED, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZED BOTH THE NFL REVENUES AND NFL COSTS IN THE QUARTERS

THE GAMES WERE AIRED.

UNDER EITF 00-21S REQUIREMENTS FOR

SEPARATING THE REVENUE ELEMENTS OF A SINGLE CONTRACT, BEGINNING

IN FISCAL 2003 THE COMPANY NO LONGER ALLOCATES ESPNS

AFFILIATE REVENUE BETWEEN NFL AND NON-NFL PROGRAMMING FOR

ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY NO LONGER

MATCHES ALL NFL REVENUE WITH NFL COSTS, AS ESPN AFFILIATE

REVENUE (INCLUDING THE NFL PORTION) IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED

RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, WHILE NFL CONTRACT COSTS CONTINUE

TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE QUARTERS THE GAMES ARE AIRED. THIS

ACCOUNTING CHANGE IMPACTS ONLY THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION

AND HAS NO IMPACT ON CASH FLOW. AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE, THE

MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT REPORTS

-61-

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY

IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER WHEN THE MAJORITY OF THE NFL GAMES

ARE AIRED, WITH COMMENSURATELY INCREASED REVENUES AND PROFITS IN

THE SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS.

THE COMPANY ELECTED TO ADOPT THIS NEW ACCOUNTING

RULE USING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT APPROACH AND RECORDED AN

AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $71 MILLION FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT

OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR

2003. THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTED THE REVENUE RECORDED FOR NFL GAMES

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2002, WHICH HAS BEEN

RECORDED RATABLY OVER FISCAL 2003 UNDER THE NEW ACCOUNTING

METHOD.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT

MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST

RATE CHANGES, FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS AND CHANGES IN THE

MARKET VALUES OF ITS INVESTMENTS.

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, WE EMPLOY

ESTABLISHED POLICIES AND PROCEDURES TO MANAGE THE COMPANYS

EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND

THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY

SECURITIES USING A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OUR OBJECTIVES IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INTEREST

RATE CHANGES ARE TO LIMIT THE IMPACT OF INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY

ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND TO LOWER OVERALL BORROWING COSTS.

TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES, WE PRIMARILY USE INTEREST RATE

SWAPS TO MANAGE NET EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES RELATED TO

THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS FIXED-RATE DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET

DEBT BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES.

OUR OBJECTIVE IN MANAGING EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS IS TO REDUCE VOLATILITY OF EARNINGS AND

CASH FLOW IN ORDER TO ALLOW MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ON CORE BUSINESS

ISSUES AND CHALLENGES. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES

CHANGE TO PROTECT THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF ITS

EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, COMMITMENTS AND

FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES. THE COMPANY UTILIZES

OPTION STRATEGIES AND FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE

SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES TO HEDGE PROBABLE, BUT NOT FIRMLY

COMMITTED, TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO USES FORWARD CONTRACTS

TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE PRINCIPAL

FOREIGN CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE

YEN AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO

EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO

U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED BORROWINGS. BY POLICY, THE COMPANY

MAINTAINS HEDGE COVERAGE BETWEEN MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM PERCENTAGES

OF ITS FORECASTED FOREIGN EXCHANGE EXPOSURES GENERALLY FOR

PERIODS NOT TO EXCEED FIVE YEARS. THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE

CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT

VALUE OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES.

IT IS THE COMPANYS POLICY TO ENTER INTO

FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS AND

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ONLY TO THE EXTENT CONSIDERED

NECESSARY TO MEET ITS OBJECTIVES AS STATED ABOVE. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT ENTER INTO THESE TRANSACTIONS OR ANY OTHER HEDGING

TRANSACTIONS FOR SPECULATIVE PURPOSES.

VALUE AT RISK (VAR)

THE COMPANY UTILIZES A VAR MODEL TO ESTIMATE THE

MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS INTEREST

RATE, FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS. THE VAR MODEL ESTIMATES WERE MADE ASSUMING NORMAL

MARKET CONDITIONS AND A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL. VARIOUS MODELING

TECHNIQUES CAN BE USED IN A VAR COMPUTATION. THE COMPANYS

COMPUTATIONS ARE BASED ON THE INTERRELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN

MOVEMENTS IN VARIOUS INTEREST RATES, CURRENCIES AND EQUITY

PRICES (A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE TECHNIQUE). THESE

INTERRELATIONSHIPS WERE DETERMINED BY OBSERVING INTEREST RATE,

FOREIGN CURRENCY AND EQUITY MARKET CHANGES OVER THE PRECEDING

QUARTER FOR THE CALCULATION OF VAR AMOUNTS AT YEAR END FISCAL

2005. THE MODEL INCLUDES ALL OF THE COMPANYS DEBT AS WELL

AS ALL INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS

AND MARKET SENSITIVE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS, FIRM COMMITMENTS AND RECEIVABLES AND ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, WHICH CERTAIN OF

THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE INTENDED TO HEDGE, WERE EXCLUDED FROM THE

MODEL.

THE VAR MODEL IS A RISK ANALYSIS TOOL AND DOES

NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE THAT WILL

BE INCURRED BY THE COMPANY, NOR DOES IT CONSIDER THE POTENTIAL

EFFECT OF FAVORABLE CHANGES IN MARKET FACTORS.

-63-

VAR ON A COMBINED BASIS DECREASED FROM

$31 MILLION AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 TO $21 MILLION

AT OCTOBER 1, 2005. THE MAJORITY OF THE DECREASE IS DUE TO

LOWER VOLATILITY AND A LOWER MARKET VALUE OF INTEREST RATE

SENSITIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE ESTIMATED MAXIMUM POTENTIAL ONE-DAY LOSS IN

FAIR VALUE, CALCULATED USING THE VAR MODEL, IS AS FOLLOWS

(UNAUDITED, IN MILLIONS).

IS IMMATERIAL AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2005. IN CALCULATING THE VAR

IT WAS DETERMINED THAT CREDIT RISKS ARE THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR

CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF EURO DISNEYS DEBT RATHER THAN

INTEREST RATE RISKS. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE EXCLUDED EURO

DISNEYS BORROWINGS FROM THE VAR CALCULATION.

MANAGEMENT HAS IMPLEMENTED CONTROLS AND MONITORING OVER SUPPLIER

PROCESSES THAT MANAGEMENT BELIEVES ARE ADEQUATE TO MEET THE

COMPANYS CONTROL OBJECTIVES OVER PROCESSES THAT COULD HAVE

A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OTHER SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OR IN

FACTORS AFFECTING INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

DURING THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED OCTOBER 1, 2005, THAT HAVE

MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY

CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF THESE

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE

STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE

AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING

THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING APPEARING

UNDER ITEM 9A, THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF OCTOBER 1,

2005 BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION

(COSO), IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON

THOSE CRITERIA. FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY

MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2005, BASED ON

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COSO. THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT

-74-

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING

THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND

PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER NECESSARY IN THE

CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE

BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO

THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL,

ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS

OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE

WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY;

AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION

OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR

DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT

MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF

EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT

CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS,

OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES

MAY DETERIORATE.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE

COMPANY INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES AFTER ELIMINATION OF INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND

TRANSACTIONS. IN DECEMBER 1999, DVD FINANCING, INC. (DFI), A

SUBSIDIARY OF DISNEY VACATION DEVELOPMENT, INC. AND AN INDIRECT

SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, COMPLETED A RECEIVABLE SALE

TRANSACTION WHICH ESTABLISHED A FACILITY THAT PERMITS DFI TO

SELL RECEIVABLES ARISING FROM THE SALE OF VACATION CLUB

MEMBERSHIPS ON A PERIODIC BASIS. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS

FACILITY, DFI PREPARES SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ALTHOUGH

ITS SEPARATE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE ALSO CONSOLIDATED IN

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

SFAS 123R

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY

ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

NO. 123R,

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(SFAS 123R),

WHICH REVISES SFAS 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION

AND SUPERSEDES ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES BOARD

OPINION NO. 25,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES

(APB 25). SFAS 123R REQUIRES THAT NEW, MODIFIED

AND UNVESTED SHARE-BASED PAYMENT TRANSACTIONS WITH EMPLOYEES,

SUCH AS STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK, BE RECOGNIZED IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUE AND RECOGNIZED AS

COMPENSATION EXPENSE OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. THE COMPANY

ADOPTED SFAS 123R EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2004, USING THE

MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. THIS METHOD ALLOWS THE

RESTATEMENT OF INTERIM FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE YEAR OF

ADOPTION BASED ON THE AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY CALCULATED AND REPORTED

IN THE PRO FORMA FOOTNOTE DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY SFAS 123.

HOWEVER, FISCAL YEARS PRIOR TO 2005 HAVE NOT BEEN RESTATED. THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS 123R IN FISCAL 2005 RESULTED IN THE

RECOGNITION OF STOCK OPTION EXPENSE OF $253 MILLION AND

$53 MILLION OF NET CAPITALIZED COMPENSATION COSTS, A

REDUCTION IN NET INCOME OF $160 MILLION (NET OF TAX

BENEFITS OF $93 MILLION), A REDUCTION IN BASIC AND DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE OF $0.08, A REDUCTION OF $24 MILLION IN

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND AN INCREASE OF

$24 MILLION IN CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

WITH APB 25 AND ITS RELATED INTERPRETATIONS AND WERE

GENERALLY GRANTED AT MARKET VALUE. ACCORDINGLY, COMPENSATION

EXPENSE FOR STOCK OPTION AWARDS WAS GENERALLY NOT RECOGNIZED IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME. THE FOLLOWING TABLE

YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003, HAD THE COMPANY

ELECTED TO ADOPT THE FAIR VALUE APPROACH OF SFAS 123, AS

STATEMENTS FOR THOSE YEARS. THE PRO FORMA AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE

REPRESENTATIVE OF FUTURE DISCLOSURES SINCE THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF STOCK OPTIONS IS AMORTIZED TO EXPENSE OVER THE VESTING

PERIOD, AND ADDITIONAL OPTIONS MAY BE GRANTED OR OPTIONS MAY BE

EITF D-108

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE

(EITF) ISSUED TOPIC NO. D-108

USE OF THE RESIDUAL METHOD

TO VALUE ACQUIRED ASSETS OTHER THAN GOODWILL

(EITF D-108). EITF D-108 REQUIRES THAT A DIRECT VALUE

METHOD BE USED TO VALUE INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS COMPLETED AFTER SEPTEMBER 29, 2004.

EITF D-108 ALSO REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO PERFORM AN

IMPAIRMENT TEST USING A DIRECT VALUE METHOD ON ALL INTANGIBLE

ASSETS THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY VALUED USING THE RESIDUAL METHOD.

ANY IMPAIRMENTS ARISING FROM THE INITIAL APPLICATION OF A DIRECT

VALUE METHOD ARE REPORTED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING

CHANGE. FOR RADIO STATION ACQUISITIONS SUBSEQUENT TO THE

ACQUISITION OF CAPITAL CITIES/ABC, INC. IN 1996, THE COMPANY

APPLIED THE RESIDUAL VALUE METHOD TO VALUE THE ACQUIRED FCC

LICENSES. WE ADOPTED EITF D-108 FOR THE FISCAL YEAR ENDED

OCTOBER 1, 2005 AND RECORDED A NON-CASH, $57 MILLION

PRE-TAX CHARGE ($36 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AS A CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE.

SFAS 152 AND SOP 04-2

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 152,

ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE

TIME-SHARING TRANSACTIONS

(SFAS 152). THE FASB ISSUED

THIS STATEMENT AS A RESULT OF GUIDANCE PROVIDED IN AMERICAN

INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS STATEMENT OF

POSITION 04-2,

ACCOUNTING FOR REAL ESTATE TIME-SHARING

TRANSACTIONS

(SOP 04-2), WHICH APPLIES TO ALL REAL

ESTATE TIME-SHARING TRANSACTIONS. SFAS 152 IS EFFECTIVE FOR

FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2005. WE EXPECT THAT

THE IMPACT OF ADOPTION WILL NOT BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

FIN 46R

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION

NO. 46R,

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

(FIN 46R). VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) ARE

GENERALLY ENTITIES THAT LACK SUFFICIENT EQUITY TO FINANCE THEIR

ACTIVITIES WITHOUT ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT FROM OTHER

PARTIES OR WHOSE EQUITY HOLDERS LACK ADEQUATE DECISION MAKING

ABILITY. ALL VIES WITH WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED MUST BE

EVALUATED TO DETERMINE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE RISKS AND

REWARDS OF THE VIE. THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IS REQUIRED TO

CONSOLIDATE THE VIE FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46R,

THE COMPANY CONCLUDED THAT EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND

ARE VIES AND THAT WE ARE THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. AS A RESULT,

THE COMPANY BEGAN CONSOLIDATING EURO DISNEY AND HONG KONG

DISNEYLANDS BALANCE SHEETS ON MARCH 31, 2004, THE END

OF THE COMPANYS SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, AND THE

INCOME AND CASH FLOW STATEMENTS BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2004,

THE BEGINNING OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004. UNDER

FIN 46R TRANSITION RULES, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF EURO

DISNEY AND HONG KONG DISNEYLAND CONTINUED TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR ON

THE EQUITY METHOD FOR THE SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004

(SEE NOTE 4).

-86-

WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THE REST OF OUR EQUITY

INVESTMENTS DO NOT REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION AS EITHER THEY ARE NOT

VIES, OR IN THE EVENT THAT THEY ARE VIES, WE ARE NOT THE PRIMARY

BENEFICIARY. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS VARIABLE INTERESTS IN CERTAIN

OTHER VIES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN CONSOLIDATED BECAUSE THE COMPANY

IS NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. THESE VIES DO NOT INVOLVE ANY

MATERIAL EXPOSURE TO THE COMPANY.

EITF 00-21

THE COMPANY ADOPTED EITF NO. 00-21,

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES

(EITF 00-21), EFFECTIVE AT THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL

2003. EITF 00-21 ADDRESSES REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR REVENUES

DERIVED FROM A SINGLE CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT THAT CONTAINS

MULTIPLE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. THE RULE PROVIDES ADDITIONAL

REQUIREMENTS TO DETERMINE WHEN SUCH REVENUES MAY BE RECORDED

SEPARATELY FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. PREVIOUSLY, THE COMPANY HAD

RECOGNIZED THE NFL BROADCAST PORTION OF ESPNS AFFILIATE

REVENUE WHEN THE NFL GAMES WERE AIRED, AS ESPNS AFFILIATE

CONTRACTS PROVIDED A BASIS FOR ALLOCATING SUCH REVENUE BETWEEN

NFL AND NON-NFL PROGRAMMING. SINCE THE COST OF THE NFL RIGHTS

HAD ALSO BEEN RECOGNIZED AS THE GAMES WERE AIRED, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZED BOTH THE NFL REVENUES AND NFL COSTS IN THE QUARTERS

THE GAMES WERE AIRED.

UNDER EITF 00-21S REQUIREMENTS FOR

SEPARATING THE REVENUE ELEMENTS OF A SINGLE CONTRACT, BEGINNING

IN FISCAL 2003 THE COMPANY NO LONGER ALLOCATES ESPNS

AFFILIATE REVENUE BETWEEN NFL AND NON-NFL PROGRAMMING FOR

ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. AS A CONSEQUENCE, THE COMPANY NO LONGER

MATCHES ALL NFL REVENUE WITH NFL COSTS, AS ESPN AFFILIATE

REVENUE (INCLUDING THE NFL PORTION) IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED

RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, WHILE NFL CONTRACT COSTS CONTINUE

TO BE RECOGNIZED IN THE QUARTERS THE GAMES ARE AIRED. THIS

ACCOUNTING CHANGE IMPACTS ONLY THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION

AND HAS NO IMPACT ON CASH FLOW. AS A RESULT OF THIS CHANGE, THE

MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT REPORTS SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED REVENUE AND

PROFITABILITY IN THE FIRST FISCAL QUARTER WHEN THE MAJORITY OF

THE NFL GAMES ARE AIRED, WITH COMMENSURATELY INCREASED REVENUES

AND PROFITS IN THE SECOND AND THIRD FISCAL QUARTERS.

THE COMPANY ELECTED TO ADOPT THIS NEW ACCOUNTING

RULE USING THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT APPROACH AND RECORDED AN

AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $71 MILLION FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT

OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING AS OF THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL YEAR

2003. THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTED THE REVENUE RECORDED FOR NFL GAMES

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2002, WHICH HAS BEEN

RECORDED RATABLY OVER FISCAL 2003 UNDER THE NEW ACCOUNTING

METHOD.

REPORTING PERIOD

EFFECTIVE WITH THE BEGINNING OF FISCAL 2005 AND

IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPLETION OF THE COMPANYS

IMPLEMENTATION OF NEW COMPANY-WIDE ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS IN LATE

FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS REPORTING PERIOD FROM A

CALENDAR PERIOD END TO A PERIOD END THAT COINCIDES WITH THE

CUT-OFF OF THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING SYSTEMS. THE ACCOUNTING

SYSTEMS CUT OFF ON THE SATURDAY CLOSEST TO THE CALENDAR QUARTER

END. ACCORDINGLY, FISCAL 2005 BEGAN ON OCTOBER 1, 2004 AND

ENDED ON OCTOBER 1, 2005. THIS RESULTED IN THE SAME NUMBER

OF REPORTING DAYS IN EACH YEAR, SINCE FISCAL 2004 INCLUDED THE

ADDITIONAL DAY ASSOCIATED WITH THE LEAP YEAR. THE CHANGE DID NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON YEAR-OVER-YEAR EARNINGS COMPARISONS.

FISCAL 2009 WILL BE THE FIRST FIFTY-THREE WEEK FISCAL YEAR

FOLLOWING THIS CHANGE.

RECLASSIFICATION

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE IN THE

FISCAL 2004 AND FISCAL 2003 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS TO CONFORM TO

THE FISCAL 2005 PRESENTATION.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT

AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

FOOTNOTES THERETO. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THOSE

ESTIMATES.

-87-

REVENUE RECOGNITION

BROADCAST ADVERTISING REVENUES ARE RECOGNIZED

WHEN COMMERCIALS ARE AIRED. REVENUES FROM TELEVISION

SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS PRIMARY

CABLE PROGRAMMING SERVICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE

PROVIDED. CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS CONTRACTS WITH CABLE

SERVICE PROVIDERS INCLUDE ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS. IN

THESE CASES, REVENUE SUBJECT TO THE COMMITMENT, WHICH IS

GENERALLY COLLECTED RATABLY OVER THE YEAR, IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE

ANNUAL COMMITMENTS ARE SATISFIED WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN

HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

REVENUES FROM ADVANCE THEME PARK TICKET SALES ARE

RECOGNIZED WHEN THE TICKETS ARE USED. FOR NON-EXPIRING,

MULTI-DAY TICKETS AND TICKETS SOLD THROUGH BULK DISTRIBUTION

CHANNELS, WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE BASED ON ESTIMATED USAGE PATTERNS

WHICH ARE DERIVED FROM HISTORICAL USAGE PATTERNS. REVENUES FROM

CORPORATE SPONSORS AT THE THEME PARKS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED

OVER THE PERIOD OF THE APPLICABLE AGREEMENTS COMMENCING WITH THE

OPENING OF THE RELATED ATTRACTION.

REVENUES FROM THE THEATRICAL DISTRIBUTION OF

MOTION PICTURES ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN MOTION PICTURES ARE

EXHIBITED. REVENUES FROM VIDEO SALES, NET OF ANTICIPATED

RETURNS, ARE RECOGNIZED ON THE DATE THAT VIDEO UNITS ARE MADE

AVAILABLE FOR SALE BY RETAILERS. REVENUES FROM THE LICENSING OF

FEATURE FILMS AND TELEVISION PROGRAMMING ARE RECORDED WHEN THE

MATERIAL IS AVAILABLE FOR TELECASTING BY THE LICENSEE AND WHEN

CERTAIN OTHER CONDITIONS ARE MET.

MERCHANDISE LICENSING ADVANCE AND GUARANTEE

ROYALTY PAYMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE UNDERLYING ROYALTIES

ARE EARNED.

ADVERTISING EXPENSE

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ADVERTISING EXPENSE INCURRED FOR FISCAL 2005, 2004 AND 2003

TOTALED $2.9 BILLION, $3.0 BILLION AND

$2.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH ON HAND

AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE

MONTHS OR LESS.

INVESTMENTS

DEBT SECURITIES THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE POSITIVE

INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE CLASSIFIED AS

HELD-TO-MATURITY AND REPORTED AT AMORTIZED COST.

DEBT SECURITIES NOT CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND

MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS EITHER

TRADING OR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE, AND ARE

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED

IN EARNINGS OR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, RESPECTIVELY. ALL

OTHER EQUITY SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING EITHER THE COST

METHOD OR THE EQUITY METHOD.

THE COMPANY REGULARLY REVIEWS ITS INVESTMENTS TO

DETERMINE WHETHER A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE BELOW THE COST BASIS

IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY. IF THE DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED

TO BE OTHER THAN TEMPORARY, THE COST BASIS OF THE SECURITY IS

WRITTEN DOWN TO FAIR VALUE AND THE AMOUNT OF THE WRITE-DOWN IS

INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

TRANSLATION POLICY

THE U.S. DOLLAR IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

FOR THE MAJORITY OF OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS. THE LOCAL

CURRENCY IS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY FOR EURO DISNEY, HONG KONG

DISNEYLAND AND INTERNATIONAL LOCATIONS OF THE DISNEY STORES.

FOR U.S. DOLLAR FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY

LOCATIONS, FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE

REMEASURED INTO U.S. DOLLARS AT END-OF-PERIOD EXCHANGE

RATES, EXCEPT FOR NONMONETARY BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS, WHICH ARE

REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. REVENUE AND EXPENSES

ARE REMEASURED AT AVERAGE EXCHANGE RATES IN EFFECT DURING EACH

PERIOD, EXCEPT FOR THOSE EXPENSES RELATED TO THE

-88-

PREVIOUSLY NOTED BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS, WHICH ARE

REMEASURED AT HISTORICAL EXCHANGE RATES. GAINS OR LOSSES FROM

FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENT ARE INCLUDED IN NET EARNINGS.

FOR THE LOCAL CURRENCY FUNCTIONAL LOCATIONS,

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE TRANSLATED AT END-OF-PERIOD RATES

WHILE REVENUES AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES IN

EFFECT DURING THE PERIOD. EQUITY IS TRANSLATED AT HISTORICAL

RATES AND THE RESULTING CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE

INCLUDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (AOCI).

INVENTORIES

CARRYING AMOUNTS OF MERCHANDISE, MATERIALS AND

SUPPLIES INVENTORIES ARE GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A MOVING

AVERAGE COST BASIS AND ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS

FILM AND TELEVISION COSTS INCLUDE CAPITALIZABLE

DIRECT NEGATIVE COSTS, PRODUCTION OVERHEAD, INTEREST,

DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND ACQUIRED PRODUCTION COSTS AND ARE STATED

AT THE LOWER OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR FAIR

VALUE. ACQUIRED PROGRAMMING COSTS FOR THE COMPANYS

TELEVISION AND CABLE/SATELLITE NETWORKS ARE STATED AT THE LOWER

OF COST, LESS ACCUMULATED AMORTIZATION, OR NET REALIZABLE VALUE.

ACQUIRED TELEVISION BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS ARE

RECORDED WHEN THE LICENSE PERIOD BEGINS AND THE PROGRAM IS

AVAILABLE FOR USE. MARKETING, DISTRIBUTION, AND GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

FILM AND TELEVISION PRODUCTION AND PARTICIPATION

COSTS ARE EXPENSED BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT

PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS

REVENUES FROM ALL SOURCES ON AN INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTION BASIS.

TELEVISION NETWORK SERIES COSTS AND MULTI-YEAR SPORTS RIGHTS ARE

CHARGED TO EXPENSE BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT

PERIODS GROSS REVENUES TO ESTIMATED REMAINING TOTAL GROSS

REVENUES FROM SUCH PROGRAMS OR ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, AS

APPROPRIATE. ESTIMATED REMAINING GROSS REVENUE FOR FILM

PRODUCTIONS INCLUDES REVENUE THAT WILL BE EARNED WITHIN TEN

YEARS OF THE DATE OF THE INITIAL THEATRICAL RELEASE. FOR

TELEVISION NETWORK SERIES, WE INCLUDE REVENUES THAT WILL BE

EARNED WITHIN TEN YEARS OF THE DELIVERY OF THE FIRST EPISODE, OR

IF STILL IN PRODUCTION, FIVE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF DELIVERY OF

THE MOST RECENT EPISODE, IF LATER. FOR ACQUIRED FILM LIBRARIES,

REMAINING REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS TO BE EARNED FOR UP TO TWENTY

YEARS FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. TELEVISION NETWORK AND

STATION RIGHTS FOR THEATRICAL MOVIES AND OTHER LONG-FORM

PROGRAMMING ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE PRIMARILY ON AN ACCELERATED

BASIS RELATED TO THE PROJECTED USAGE OF THE PROGRAMS.

DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR PROJECTS THAT HAVE BEEN DETERMINED WILL

NOT GO INTO PRODUCTION OR HAVE NOT BEEN SET FOR PRODUCTION

WITHIN THREE YEARS ARE WRITTEN OFF.

ESTIMATES OF TOTAL GROSS REVENUES CAN CHANGE

SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ADVERTISING

RATES AND THE LEVEL OF MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF THE PRODUCTION.

ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND

AMORTIZATION IS ADJUSTED, IF NECESSARY. SUCH ADJUSTMENTS COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE

PERIODS. THE NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF NETWORK TELEVISION

BROADCAST PROGRAM LICENSES AND RIGHTS IS REVIEWED USING A

DAYPART METHODOLOGY. A DAYPART IS DEFINED AS AN AGGREGATION OF

PROGRAMS BROADCAST DURING A PARTICULAR TIME OF DAY OR PROGRAMS

OF A SIMILAR TYPE. THE COMPANYS DAYPARTS ARE EARLY

MORNING, DAYTIME, LATE NIGHT, PRIMETIME, NEWS, CHILDREN AND

SPORTS (INCLUDES NETWORK AND CABLE). THE NET REALIZABLE VALUES

OF OTHER CABLE PROGRAMMING ARE REVIEWED ON AN AGGREGATED BASIS

FOR EACH CABLE CHANNEL.

CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS

THE COMPANY EXPENSES COSTS INCURRED IN THE

PRELIMINARY PROJECT STAGE OF DEVELOPING OR ACQUIRING INTERNAL

USE SOFTWARE, SUCH AS RESEARCH AND FEASIBILITY STUDIES, AS WELL

AS COSTS INCURRED IN THE POST-IMPLEMENTATION/OPERATIONAL STAGE,

SUCH AS MAINTENANCE AND TRAINING. CAPITALIZATION OF SOFTWARE

DEVELOPMENT COSTS OCCURS ONLY AFTER THE PRELIMINARY PROJECT

STAGE IS COMPLETE, MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZES THE PROJECT, AND IT IS

PROBABLE THAT THE PROJECT WILL BE COMPLETED AND THE SOFTWARE

WILL BE USED FOR THE FUNCTION INTENDED. AS OF OCTOBER 1,

2005 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, CAPITALIZED SOFTWARE COSTS

-89-

TOTALED $483 MILLION AND $433 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE

SOFTWARE, WHICH RANGES FROM 3-10 YEARS.

PARKS, RESORTS AND OTHER PROPERTY

PARKS, RESORTS AND OTHER PROPERTY ARE CARRIED AT

HISTORICAL COST. DEPRECIATION IS COMPUTED ON THE STRAIGHT-LINE

METHOD OVER ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AS FOLLOWS.

ATTRACTIONS

25  40 YEARS

BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

THE COMPANY PERFORMS AN ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST AT

FISCAL YEAR END FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDE FCC LICENSES AND TRADEMARKS. AS

REQUIRED BY STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

(SFAS 142), GOODWILL IS ALLOCATED TO VARIOUS REPORTING

UNITS, WHICH ARE EITHER THE OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE REPORTING

LEVEL BELOW THE OPERATING SEGMENT. FOR PURPOSES OF PERFORMING

THE IMPAIRMENT TEST FOR GOODWILL AS REQUIRED BY SFAS 142,

WE ESTABLISHED THE FOLLOWING REPORTING UNITS: CABLE NETWORKS,

TELEVISION BROADCASTING, RADIO, STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT, CONSUMER

PRODUCTS AND PARKS AND RESORTS.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT TO ITS CARRYING AMOUNT ON AN

ANNUAL BASIS TO DETERMINE IF THERE IS POTENTIAL GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT. IF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN

ITS CARRYING VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECORDED TO THE EXTENT

THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WITHIN THE REPORTING UNIT IS

LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF ITS GOODWILL.

SFAS 142 REQUIRES THE COMPANY TO COMPARE THE

FAIR VALUE OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET TO ITS

CARRYING AMOUNT. IF THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSET EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS

RECOGNIZED. FAIR VALUES FOR GOODWILL AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS,

MARKET MULTIPLES OR APPRAISED VALUES AS APPROPRIATE.

TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR REPORTING

UNITS, WE GENERALLY USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE (DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW) CORROBORATED BY MARKET MULTIPLES WHEN AVAILABLE AND

AS APPROPRIATE, EXCEPT FOR THE TELEVISION NETWORK, A BUSINESS

WITHIN THE TELEVISION BROADCASTING REPORTING UNIT. THE

TELEVISION BROADCASTING REPORTING UNIT INCLUDES THE TELEVISION

NETWORK AND THE OWNED AND OPERATED TELEVISION STATIONS. THESE

BUSINESSES HAVE BEEN GROUPED TOGETHER BECAUSE THEIR RESPECTIVE

CASH FLOWS ARE DEPENDENT ON ONE ANOTHER. FOR PURPOSES OF OUR

IMPAIRMENT TEST, WE USED A REVENUE MULTIPLE TO VALUE THE

TELEVISION NETWORK. WE DID NOT USE A PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE OR

A MARKET MULTIPLE APPROACH TO VALUE THE TELEVISION NETWORK AS A

PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUE WOULD NOT CAPTURE THE FULL FAIR VALUE OF

THE TELEVISION NETWORK AND THERE IS LITTLE COMPARABLE MARKET

DATA AVAILABLE DUE TO THE SCARCITY OF TELEVISION NETWORKS. WE

APPLIED WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST APPROPRIATE VALUATION

METHODOLOGY FOR EACH OF THE REPORTING UNITS. IF WE HAD

ESTABLISHED DIFFERENT REPORTING UNITS OR UTILIZED DIFFERENT

VALUATION METHODOLOGIES, THE IMPAIRMENT TEST RESULTS COULD

DIFFER.

AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, PRINCIPALLY

COPYRIGHTS, ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER PERIODS

RANGING FROM 10  31 YEARS.

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS

IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY

EMPLOYS A VARIETY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE ITS

EXPOSURE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES AND INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY AND DEBT SECURITIES,

INCLUDING INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAP AGREEMENTS;

FORWARD, OPTION AND SWAPTION CONTRACTS AND INTEREST

RATE CAPS.

-90-

THE COMPANY FORMALLY DOCUMENTS ALL RELATIONSHIPS

BETWEEN HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGED ITEMS, AS WELL AS ITS

RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND STRATEGIES FOR UNDERTAKING

VARIOUS HEDGE TRANSACTIONS. THERE ARE TWO TYPES OF DERIVATIVES

INTO WHICH THE COMPANY ENTERS: HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE AND

HEDGES OF CASH FLOW EXPOSURE. HEDGES OF FAIR VALUE EXPOSURE ARE

ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED

ASSET, LIABILITY, OR A FIRM COMMITMENT. HEDGES OF CASH FLOW

EXPOSURE ARE ENTERED INTO IN ORDER TO HEDGE A FORECASTED

TRANSACTION (E.G. FORECASTED REVENUE) OR THE VARIABILITY OF CASH

FLOWS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED, RELATED TO A RECOGNIZED LIABILITY

OR ASSET (E.G. FLOATING RATE DEBT).

THE COMPANY DESIGNATES AND ASSIGNS THE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AS HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFIC

ASSETS, OR SPECIFIC LIABILITIES. WHEN HEDGED ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES ARE SOLD OR EXTINGUISHED OR THE FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED ARE NO LONGER EXPECTED TO OCCUR, THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DESIGNATED HEDGING

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

OPTION PREMIUMS AND UNREALIZED LOSSES ON FORWARD

CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND

CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS ARE

RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AS OTHER ASSETS. UNREALIZED GAINS

ON FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE ACCRUED DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST

RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS TO BE PAID UNDER THE AGREEMENTS

ARE INCLUDED IN LIABILITIES. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FROM

HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE INCOME STATEMENT CONSISTENT WITH

THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED. THE COMPANY

ACCRUES THE DIFFERENTIAL FOR INTEREST RATE AND CROSS-CURRENCY

SWAPS TO BE PAID OR RECEIVED UNDER THE AGREEMENTS AS INTEREST

RATES AND EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE AS ADJUSTMENTS TO INTEREST

EXPENSE OVER THE LIVES OF THE SWAPS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE

TERMINATION OF EFFECTIVE SWAP AGREEMENTS, PRIOR TO THEIR

ORIGINAL MATURITY, ARE DEFERRED AND AMORTIZED TO INTEREST

EXPENSE OVER THE REMAINING TERM OF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED

TRANSACTIONS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO

RISK MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES AND

DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THESE CONTRACTS ARE

INTENDED TO OFFSET CERTAIN ECONOMIC EXPOSURES OF THE COMPANY AND

ARE CARRIED AT MARKET VALUE WITH ANY CHANGES IN VALUE RECORDED

IN EARNINGS. CASH FLOWS FROM HEDGES ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS UNDER THE SAME CATEGORY AS

THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE RELATED ASSETS, LIABILITIES OR

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS (SEE NOTES 6 AND 12).

EARNINGS PER SHARE

THE COMPANY PRESENTS BOTH BASIC AND DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) AMOUNTS. BASIC EPS IS CALCULATED

BY DIVIDING NET INCOME BY THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON

SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR. DILUTED EPS IS BASED UPON

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF COMMON AND COMMON EQUIVALENT

SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEAR WHICH IS CALCULATED USING THE

TREASURY STOCK METHOD FOR STOCK OPTIONS AND ASSUMES CONVERSION

OF THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE SENIOR NOTES (SEE

NOTE 6). COMMON EQUIVALENT SHARES ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE

COMPUTATION IN PERIODS IN WHICH THEY HAVE AN ANTI-DILUTIVE

EFFECT. STOCK OPTIONS FOR WHICH THE EXERCISE PRICE EXCEEDS THE

AVERAGE MARKET PRICE OVER THE PERIOD ARE ANTI-DILUTIVE AND,

ACCORDINGLY, ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE CALCULATION.

SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS AND DISPOSITIONS AND RESTRUCTURING AND

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES

ON JUNE 20, 2005, THE COMPANY SOLD THE

MIGHTY DUCKS OF ANAHEIM, WHICH RESULTED IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF

$26 MILLION THAT WAS REPORTED IN GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES

AND RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 21, 2004, THE COMPANY

SOLD SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DISNEY STORE CHAIN IN NORTH

AMERICA UNDER A LONG-TERM LICENSING ARRANGEMENT TO A

WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE CHILDRENS PLACE (TCP). THE

COMPANY RECEIVED $100 MILLION FOR THE WORKING CAPITAL

TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER AT THE CLOSING OF THE TRANSACTION.

DURING FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED A LOSS ON THE WORKING

CAPITAL THAT WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER AND ADDITIONAL

RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE SALE

(PRIMARILY FOR EMPLOYEE RETENTION AND SEVERANCE AND LEASE

TERMINATION COSTS) TOTALING $32 MILLION. PURSUANT TO THE

TERMS OF SALE, THE DISNEY STORE NORTH AMERICA RETAINED ITS LEASE

OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THE STORES TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYER AND

BECAME A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF TCP. TCP IS REQUIRED TO PAY

THE COMPANY A ROYALTY ON SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PHYSICAL

RETAIL STORE SALES BEGINNING ON THE SECOND ANNIVERSARY OF THE

CLOSING DATE OF THE SALE.

DURING THE YEARS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004

AND 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED $64 MILLION AND

$16 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES RELATED TO THE DISNEY STORE. THE BULK OF THESE CHARGES

WERE IMPAIRMENTS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF FIXED ASSETS RELATED

TO THE STORES TO BE SOLD.

ON FEBRUARY 17, 2004, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED

THE FILM LIBRARY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS FOR THE

MUPPETS

AND

BEAR IN THE BIG BLUE HOUSE

FOR

$68 MILLION. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS

ALLOCATED TO DEFINITE-LIVED IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

IN FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY SOLD THE ANAHEIM

ANGELS BASEBALL TEAM, WHICH RESULTED IN A PRE-TAX GAIN OF

$16 MILLION. THIS GAIN IS REPORTED IN GAIN ON SALE OF

BUSINESSES AND RESTRUCTURING AND IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME.

THE MOA ADDITIONALLY PROVIDED FOR THE

CONTRIBUTION BY EURO DISNEY OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES (INCLUDING MOST OF THE PROCEEDS OF THE EQUITY

RIGHTS OFFERINGS REFERRED TO ABOVE) INTO DISNEY SCA, WHICH

BECAME AN 82% OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF EURO DISNEY. OTHER

WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY RETAINED THE REMAINING

18% OWNERSHIP INTEREST. THIS ENABLED EURO DISNEY TO AVOID HAVING

TO MAKE



292 MILLION

OF PAYMENTS TO DISNEY SCA THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN DUE IF EURO

DISNEY EXERCISED THE OPTIONS UNDER CERTAIN LEASES FROM DISNEY

SCA. IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESTRUCTURING, THE COMPANY INCREASED

ITS OVERALL EFFECTIVE OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN DISNEYLAND RESORT

PARIS OPERATIONS FROM 41% TO 51%. PURSUANT TO THE MOA, THE

COMPANY MUST MAINTAIN AT LEAST A DIRECT 39% OWNERSHIP INVESTMENT

IN EURO DISNEY THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2016.

THE MOA RESULTED IN THE ELIMINATION OF CERTAIN

SUBLEASE ARRANGEMENTS BETWEEN THE COMPANYS THEN

WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, DISNEY SCA AND EURO DISNEY. THESE

SUBLEASES AROSE IN CONNECTION WITH A FINANCIAL RESTRUCTURING OF

EURO DISNEY IN 1994 WHEREBY DISNEY SCA (WHICH WAS THEN IN THE

FORM OF A SNC) ENTERED INTO A LEASE AGREEMENT WITH A FINANCING

COMPANY WITH A NON-CANCELABLE TERM OF 12 YEARS RELATED TO

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE DISNEYLAND PARK ASSETS, AND THEN

ENTERED INTO A 12-YEAR SUBLEASE AGREEMENT WITH EURO DISNEY ON

SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME PAYMENT TERMS. THESE LEASE TRANSACTIONS

WERE ELIMINATED FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES UPON

CONSOLIDATION OF EURO DISNEY BY THE COMPANY AS A RESULT OF THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF FIN 46R.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, THE MOA PROVIDED FOR A 2%

INTEREST RATE INCREASE FOR CERTAIN TRANCHES OF EURO

DISNEYS DEBT, WHICH RESULTED IN A SUBSTANTIAL MODIFICATION

OF A PORTION OF THIS DEBT. RELEVANT ACCOUNTING RULES REQUIRED

THAT THE SUBSTANTIALLY MODIFIED PORTION BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS

THOUGH IT HAD BEEN EXTINGUISHED AND REPLACED WITH NEW BORROWINGS

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, WHICH RESULTED IN A $61 MILLION

GAIN RECORDED IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME DURING THE YEAR ENDED

OCTOBER 1, 2005.

CERTAIN INDIRECT, WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES OF

THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY HAVE LIABILITY AS CURRENT OR FORMER

GENERAL PARTNERS OF THE OPERATING SUBSIDIARY OF EURO DISNEY TO

WHICH SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF EURO DISNEYS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES WERE TRANSFERRED IN THE RESTRUCTURING. IN ADDITION

TO THEIR INTEREST IN THIS OPERATING SUBSIDIARY OF EURO DISNEY,

CERTAIN OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES OF THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN

CAPITALIZED WITH INTEREST-BEARING DEMAND NOTES WITH AN AGGREGATE

FACE VALUE OF



200 MILLION.

SEE NOTE 6 FOR THE TERMS OF EURO

DISNEYS BORROWINGS.

EURO DISNEY HAD REVENUES AND NET LOSS OF

$575 MILLION AND $122 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE

SIX MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2004 WHILE THE COMPANY STILL

ACCOUNTED FOR ITS INVESTMENT ON THE EQUITY METHOD. EURO DISNEY

HAD REVENUES AND NET LOSS OF $1,077 MILLION AND

$56 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, FOR THE YEAR ENDED

SEPTEMBER 30, 2003.

OTHER EQUITY INVESTMENTS

IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANYS INVESTMENTS IN

RESPECTIVELY, OF SECURITIES CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. AS

OF OCTOBER 1, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, THE COMPANY

ALSO HELD $50 MILLION AND $105 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

OF NON-PUBLICLY TRADED COST METHOD INVESTMENTS. REALIZED GAINS

AND LOSSES ARE DETERMINED PRINCIPALLY ON AN AVERAGE COST BASIS.

IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $14 MILLION,

$2 MILLION AND $8 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, IN NET GAINS

ON SALES OF SECURITIES.

IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, THE COMPANY RECORDED

NON-CASH CHARGES OF $42 MILLION, $23 MILLION AND

$23 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO REFLECT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

LOSSES IN VALUE OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENT IN AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED

LEASES

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY

RECORDED A $101 MILLION PRE-TAX CHARGE, OR $0.03 PER

SHARE, TO WRITE-OFF ITS INVESTMENT IN THE AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED

LEASES WITH DELTA AIR LINES, INC. (DELTA) RESULTING FROM

DELTAS BANKRUPTCY FILING IN SEPTEMBER 2005. DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY RECORDED A $16 MILLION

PRE-TAX CHARGE TO WRITE DOWN ITS LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT IN

DELTA CONSISTENT WITH OUR AGREEMENT WITH DELTA TO REDUCE LEASE

PAYMENTS. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY

WROTE OFF ITS INVESTMENT IN AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASES WITH

UNITED AIRLINES, INC., WHICH FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION,

RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX CHARGE OF $114 MILLION, OR

$0.04 PER SHARE. BASED ON THE BANKRUPTCY FILINGS, WE

BELIEVE IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE COMPANY WILL RECOVER THESE

INVESTMENTS. THE PRE-TAX CHARGES FOR THESE WRITE-OFFS WERE

REPORTED IN NET INTEREST EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF INCOME. IN THE EVENT OF A MATERIAL MODIFICATION TO

THE DELTA AIRCRAFT LEASES OR FORECLOSURE OF THE DELTA AIRCRAFT

BY THE DEBT HOLDERS, CERTAIN TAX PAYMENTS OF UP TO

$100 MILLION COULD BE ACCELERATED. THE EXPECTED TAX

PAYMENTS ARE CURRENTLY REFLECTED ON OUR BALANCE SHEET AS A

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO RESULT IN A

FURTHER CHARGE TO EARNINGS. AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2005, OUR

REMAINING AIRCRAFT LEVERAGED LEASE INVESTMENT TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $52 MILLION WITH FEDEX CORP.

SUCH AS A CHANGE IN CONTROL. THE NOTES ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO

COMMON STOCK, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AT A CONVERSION RATE

OF 33.9443 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PER $1,000 PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT OF NOTES. THIS IS EQUIVALENT TO A CONVERSION PRICE OF

$29.46. THE CONVERSION RATE IS SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT IF CERTAIN

EVENTS OCCUR, SUCH AS THE PAYMENT OF A COMMON STOCK DIVIDEND,

THE ISSUANCE OF RIGHTS OR WARRANTS TO ALL HOLDERS OF THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK THAT ALLOW THE HOLDERS TO PURCHASE

SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK DURING A SPECIFIED

PERIOD OF TIME, AND SUBDIVISION, COMBINATIONS OR CERTAIN

RECLASSIFICATIONS OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK.

UNDER THE PROGRAM REPLENISHES AS OUTSTANDING DEBT UNDER THE

PROGRAM MATURES. AT OCTOBER 1, 2005, THE TOTAL DEBT

OUTSTANDING UNDER THE PROGRAM WAS $213 MILLION. THE

MATURITIES OF CURRENT OUTSTANDING BORROWINGS RANGE FROM 1 TO

10 AND 15 YEARS FROM INCEPTION OF THE FILM FINANCING

IN 2005 THE COMPANY DERIVED TAX BENEFITS OF

$88 MILLION FROM AN EXCLUSION PROVIDED UNDER

U.S. INCOME TAX LAWS WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN

EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO FOREIGN TRADING GROSS

RECEIPTS (FTGRS). THIS EXCLUSION WAS REPEALED AS

PART OF THE

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

(THE

ACT), WHICH WAS ENACTED ON OCTOBER 22, 2004.

THE ACT PROVIDES FOR A PHASE-OUT SUCH THAT THE EXCLUSION FOR THE

COMPANYS OTHERWISE QUALIFYING FTGRS GENERATED IN FISCAL

2005, 2006 AND 2007 WILL BE LIMITED TO APPROXIMATELY 85%, 65%

AND 15%, RESPECTIVELY. NO EXCLUSION WILL BE AVAILABLE IN FISCAL

YEARS 2008 AND THEREAFTER.

THE ACT ALSO PROVIDES FOR A ONE-TIME TAX

DEDUCTION OF 85% OF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT ARE

REPATRIATED IN FISCAL 2005. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL

2005, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED FOREIGN EARNINGS ELIGIBLE FOR THIS

DEDUCTION AND RECORDED A TAX BENEFIT OF $32 MILLION AS A

RESULT OF THE REVERSAL OF DEFERRED TAXES PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED ON

THESE EARNINGS.

THE ACT MAKES A NUMBER OF OTHER CHANGES TO THE

INCOME TAX LAWS WHICH WILL AFFECT THE COMPANY IN FUTURE YEARS,

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH IS A NEW DEDUCTION RELATING TO

QUALIFYING DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES. THE DEDUCTION EQUALS

THREE PERCENT OF QUALIFYING INCOME FOR FISCAL 2006 AND 2007, SIX

PERCENT FOR FISCAL 2008 THROUGH 2010 AND, BY FISCAL 2011, NINE

PERCENT OF SUCH INCOME. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF THE TREASURY

AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) ISSUED PROPOSED

REGULATIONS ON OCTOBER 19, 2005 WHICH PROVIDE COMPREHENSIVE

RULES, DEFINITIONS, AND EXAMPLES TO ASSIST IN THE IMPLEMENTATION

OF THIS NEW DEDUCTION. THE PROPOSED REGULATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO

FURTHER CHANGES PRIOR

-105-

TO FINALIZATION. THE COMPANY IS ANALYZING THE

PROPOSED REGULATIONS AND CANNOT ESTIMATE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFIT

WITH REASONABLE ACCURACY, BUT EXPECTS TO DERIVE BENEFITS IN

FISCAL 2006 THAT ARE SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN THOSE DERIVED

UNDER THE EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME EXCLUSION DISCUSSED ABOVE.

AS A MATTER OF COURSE, THE COMPANY IS REGULARLY

AUDITED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN TAX AUTHORITIES. FROM TIME

TO TIME, THESE AUDITS RESULT IN PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS. DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY REACHED A SETTLEMENT

WITH THE IRS REGARDING ALL ASSESSMENTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO

ITS FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 1996 THROUGH 2000, AND A

SETTLEMENT WITH THE CALIFORNIA FRANCHISE TAX BOARD REGARDING

ASSESSMENTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO ITS STATE TAX RETURNS FOR

1994 THROUGH 2003. THESE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENTS RESULTED IN THE

COMPANY RELEASING $102 MILLION IN TAX RESERVES WHICH ARE NO

LONGER REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO THESE MATTERS. DURING THE FIRST

QUARTER OF FISCAL 2005, THE FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF A TAX MATTER

RESULTED IN THE RELEASE OF $24 MILLION IN TAX RESERVES.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2004, THE COMPANY REACHED A

SETTLEMENT WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE REGARDING ALL

ASSESSMENTS PROPOSED WITH RESPECT TO ITS FEDERAL INCOME TAX

RETURNS FOR 1993 THROUGH 1995. THE FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT RESULTED

IN THE COMPANY RELEASING $120 MILLION IN TAX RESERVES THAT

ARE NO LONGER REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO THESE MATTERS. DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL 2003, THE COMPANY FAVORABLY RESOLVED

CERTAIN STATE INCOME TAX AUDIT ISSUES AND RELEASED

$56 MILLION OF RELATED TAX RESERVES.

IN FISCAL YEARS 2005, 2004 AND 2003, INCOME TAX

BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION TRANSACTIONS

THAT WERE ALLOCATED TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AMOUNTED TO

$64 MILLION, $25 MILLION AND $5 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT OCTOBER 1, 2005 AND

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 WERE REDUCED BY A VALUATION ALLOWANCE,

OF WHICH $24 MILLION IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CERTAIN ACQUIRED

NET OPERATING LOSSES. SINCE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCES ASSOCIATED

WITH THESE ACQUISITIONS RELATE TO ACQUIRED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS,

THE SUBSEQUENT REALIZATION OF THESE TAX BENEFITS WOULD RESULT IN

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ALLOWANCE AMOUNT BEING APPLIED AS REDUCTIONS

TO GOODWILL.

PLAN FUNDED STATUS

DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE PRESENT VALUE OF

PENSION OBLIGATIONS, A NUMBER OF THE COMPANYS PENSION

PLANS WERE UNDERFUNDED AT OCTOBER 1, 2005, HAVING

ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS EXCEEDING THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN

ASSETS. FOR THESE PLANS, THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS

AGGREGATED $3.4 BILLION, THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AGGREGATED $4.5 BILLION AND THE PROJECTED

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AGGREGATED $4.9 BILLION. AS A RESULT,

THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED AN ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY

ADJUSTMENT OF $1.1 BILLION AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2005. THE

ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT AT

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 WAS $415 MILLION. THE INCREASE IN

THE ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT OF

$709 MILLION IN THE CURRENT YEAR WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A

DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE FROM 6.30% AT SEPTEMBER 30,

2004 TO 5.25% AT OCTOBER 1, 2005. THIS INCREASE RESULTED IN

AN AFTER-TAX ADJUSTMENT OF $448 MILLION THAT WAS RECORDED

AS A DECREASE OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY THROUGH ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN FISCAL 2005.

THE COMPANYS TOTAL ACCUMULATED PENSION

BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT OCTOBER 1, 2005 AND

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 WERE $4.6 BILLION AND

$3.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH 97.3% AND 95.2%,

RESPECTIVELY, WERE VESTED.

THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AND FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS FOR POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL PLANS WITH ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS IN EXCESS OF PLAN ASSETS WERE $1.2 BILLION AND

$954 MILLION AND $215 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY AT YEAR

END 2004.

PLAN ASSETS

THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS DEFINED BENEFIT

PLANS ARE MANAGED ON A COMMINGLED BASIS IN A THIRD PARTY MASTER

TRUST. THE INVESTMENT POLICY AND ALLOCATION OF THE ASSETS IN THE

MASTER TRUST WERE APPROVED BY THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT AND

DURING FISCAL 2005, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED

$291 MILLION AND $12 MILLION TO ITS PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH INCLUDED

VOLUNTARY CONTRIBUTIONS ABOVE THE MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR THE

PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE, AT A

MINIMUM, $61 MILLION TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL PLANS DURING FISCAL 2006. THE COMPANY MAY MAKE

ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS INTO ITS PENSION PLANS IN FISCAL 2006

DEPENDING ON HOW THE FUNDED STATUS OF THOSE PLANS CHANGE AND

ALSO DEPENDING ON THE OUTCOME OF PROPOSED CHANGES TO THE FUNDING

REGULATIONS CURRENTLY BEING CONSIDERED BY THE UNITED STATES

CONGRESS.

ASSUMPTIONS

CERTAIN ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, SUCH AS THE

DISCOUNT RATE, LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE

HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATE HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE

AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST AS WELL AS THE

RELATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AMOUNTS.

-109-

DISCOUNT

RATE

 THE ASSUMED DISCOUNT

RATE FOR PENSION PLANS REFLECTS THE MARKET RATES FOR

HIGH-QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS CURRENTLY AVAILABLE. THE

COMPANYS DISCOUNT RATE WAS DETERMINED BY CONSIDERING THE

AVERAGE OF PENSION YIELD CURVES CONSTRUCTED OF A LARGE

POPULATION OF HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE RESULTING

DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE MATCHING OF PLAN LIABILITY CASH FLOWS

TO THE YIELD CURVES.

LONG-TERM RETURN ON

ASSETS

 THE LONG-TERM RATE

OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF LONG-TERM

RETURNS ON AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTING OF A MIXTURE OF

EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME, AND ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS. WHEN

DETERMINING THE LONG-TERM RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, THE COMPANY

CONSIDERS LONG-TERM RATES OF RETURN ON THE ASSET CLASSES (BOTH

HISTORICAL AND FORECASTED) IN WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE

PENSION FUNDS TO BE INVESTED. THE FOLLOWING RATES OF RETURN BY

ASSET CLASS WERE CONSIDERED IN SETTING THE LONG-TERM RETURN ON

ASSETS ASSUMPTION.

EQUITY SECURITIES

8%  10%

DEBT SECURITIES

4%  7%

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS

HEALTHCARE COST TREND

 THE COMPANY REVIEWS

EXTERNAL DATA AND ITS OWN HISTORICAL TRENDS FOR HEALTHCARE COSTS

TO DETERMINE THE HEALTHCARE COST TREND RATES FOR THE

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT PLANS. FOR 2005, WE ASSUMED A

10.0% ANNUAL RATE OF INCREASE IN THE PER CAPITA COST OF COVERED

HEALTHCARE CLAIMS WITH THE RATE DECREASING IN EVEN INCREMENTS

OVER SEVEN YEARS UNTIL REACHING 5.0%.

A ONE PERCENT CHANGE IN THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS WOULD

WELL AS A FEDERAL SUBSIDY TO SPONSORS OF RETIREE HEALTHCARE

BENEFIT PLANS.

-110-

THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND

MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 WAS REFLECTED IN ACCUMULATED

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS BEGINNING

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 ASSUMING THAT THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE

TO PROVIDE A PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT TO RETIREES THAT IS AT

LEAST ACTUARIALLY EQUIVALENT TO MEDICARE PART D AND THE

COMPANY WILL RECEIVE THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY.

THE ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 DECREASED BY

APPROXIMATELY $110 MILLION DUE TO THE EFFECT OF THE FEDERAL

SUBSIDY, AND THE NET PERIODIC POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT

COST FOR FISCAL 2005 WAS REDUCED BY APPROXIMATELY

$28 MILLION.

EQUITY BASED COMPENSATION

UNDER VARIOUS PLANS, THE COMPANY MAY GRANT STOCK

OPTIONS AND OTHER EQUITY BASED AWARDS TO EXECUTIVE, MANAGEMENT

AND CREATIVE PERSONNEL. IN DECEMBER 2004, THE COMPANY ADOPTED A

NEW APPROACH TO LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION, PURSUANT TO

WHICH IT INCREASED THE PROPORTION OF RSUS AND DECREASED THE

PROPORTION OF STOCK OPTIONS USED IN LONG-TERM INCENTIVE AWARDS.

STOCK OPTIONS ARE GENERALLY GRANTED AT EXERCISE

PRICES EQUAL TO OR EXCEEDING THE MARKET PRICE AT THE DATE OF

GRANT. EFFECTIVE IN JANUARY 2003, OPTIONS BECAME EXERCISABLE

RATABLY OVER A FOUR-YEAR PERIOD FROM THE GRANT DATE, WHILE

OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO JANUARY 2003 GENERALLY VEST RATABLY

OVER FIVE YEARS. EFFECTIVE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005,

OPTIONS GRANTED GENERALLY EXPIRE SEVEN YEARS AFTER THE GRANT

DATE, WHILE OPTIONS GRANTED PRIOR TO THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005

EXPIRE TEN YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT. AT THE DISCRETION OF

THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS, OPTIONS CAN OCCASIONALLY EXTEND UP TO 15 YEARS

AFTER DATE OF GRANT. RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GENERALLY VEST 50%

ON EACH OF THE SECOND AND FOURTH ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT

DATE. CERTAIN RSUS AWARDED TO SENIOR EXECUTIVES VEST BASED UPON

THE ACHIEVEMENT OF PERFORMANCE CONDITIONS. STOCK OPTIONS AND

RSUS ARE FORFEITED BY EMPLOYEES WHO TERMINATE PRIOR TO VESTING.

SHARES AVAILABLE FOR FUTURE OPTION AND RSU GRANTS AT

OCTOBER 1, 2005 TOTALED 67 MILLION. THE COMPANY

SATISFIES STOCK OPTION EXERCISES AND VESTING OF RSUS WITH NEWLY

ISSUED SHARES.

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR RSUS AND STOCK OPTIONS

IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE VESTING PERIOD. COMPENSATION

EXPENSE FOR RSUS IS BASED UPON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE SHARES

UNDERLYING THE AWARDS

-111-

ON THE GRANT DATE; HOWEVER, COMPENSATION EXPENSE

FOR PERFORMANCE-BASED AWARDS IS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE

ESTIMATED PROBABILITY OF VESTING. UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF

SFAS 123, COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR STOCK OPTIONS HAS BEEN

ESTIMATED ON THE GRANT DATE USING A BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION-PRICING

MODEL. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE ASSUMPTIONS USED IN THE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO THE IMPACT OF INTEREST

RATE CHANGES PRIMARILY THROUGH ITS BORROWING ACTIVITIES. THE

COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF INTEREST

RATE CHANGES ON EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS AND ON THE MARKET VALUE

OF ITS INVESTMENTS AND BORROWINGS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY,

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ITS FIXED RATE DEBT EXPRESSED AS A

PERCENTAGE OF ITS NET DEBT BETWEEN A MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM

PERCENTAGE.

THE COMPANY TYPICALLY USES PAY-FLOATING AND

PAY-FIXED INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO FACILITATE ITS INTEREST RATE

RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES. PAY-FLOATING SWAPS EFFECTIVELY

CONVERT FIXED RATE MEDIUM AND LONG-TERM OBLIGATIONS TO VARIABLE

RATE INSTRUMENTS INDEXED TO LIBOR. PAY-FLOATING SWAP AGREEMENTS

IN PLACE AT YEAR-END EXPIRE IN ONE TO 17 YEARS. PAY-FIXED

SWAPS EFFECTIVELY CONVERT FLOATING RATE OBLIGATIONS TO FIXED

RATE INSTRUMENTS. THE PAY-FIXED SWAPS IN PLACE AT YEAR-END

EXPIRE IN ONE TO TEN YEARS. AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2005 AND

SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 RESPECTIVELY, THE COMPANY HELD

$151 MILLION AND $148 MILLION NOTIONAL VALUE OF

PAY-FIXED SWAPS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES. THE CHANGES IN

MARKET VALUES OF ALL SWAPS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS HEDGES HAVE

BEEN INCLUDED IN EARNINGS.

-115-

THE IMPACT OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT

SIGNIFICANT FOR FISCAL 2005, 2004 AND 2003. THE NET AMOUNT OF

DEFERRED GAINS IN AOCI FROM INTEREST RATE RISK MANAGEMENT

TRANSACTIONS WAS $8 MILLION AND $10 MILLION AT

OCTOBER 1, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 RESPECTIVELY.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK MANAGEMENT

THE COMPANY TRANSACTS BUSINESS GLOBALLY AND IS

SUBJECT TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CHANGING FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATES. THE COMPANYS OBJECTIVE IS TO REDUCE EARNINGS AND

CASH FLOW FLUCTUATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE

CHANGES THEREBY ENABLING MANAGEMENT TO FOCUS ATTENTION ON CORE

BUSINESS ISSUES AND CHALLENGES.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO VARIOUS CONTRACTS THAT

CHANGE IN VALUE AS FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES CHANGE TO PROTECT THE

VALUE OF ITS EXISTING FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES, FIRM

COMMITMENTS AND FORECASTED BUT NOT FIRMLY COMMITTED FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY USES OPTION STRATEGIES AND

FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS. IN

ACCORDANCE WITH POLICY, THE COMPANY HEDGES ITS FORECASTED

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS FOR PERIODS GENERALLY NOT TO

EXCEED FIVE YEARS WITHIN AN ESTABLISHED MINIMUM AND MAXIMUM

RANGE OF ANNUAL EXPOSURE. THE COMPANY USES FORWARD CONTRACTS TO

HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND FIRM COMMITMENTS.

THE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS OFFSET CHANGES IN THE

U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE RELATED FORECASTED

TRANSACTION, ASSET, LIABILITY OR FIRM COMMITMENT. THE PRINCIPAL

CURRENCIES HEDGED ARE THE EURO, BRITISH POUND, JAPANESE YEN AND

CANADIAN DOLLAR. CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS ARE USED TO EFFECTIVELY

CONVERT FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED BORROWINGS TO

U.S. DOLLARS.

MARK TO MARKET GAINS AND LOSSES ON CONTRACTS

HEDGING FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS ARE INITIALLY

RECORDED TO AOCI AND ARE RECLASSIFIED TO CURRENT EARNINGS WHEN

THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS ARE REALIZED, OFFSETTING CHANGES IN THE

VALUE OF THE FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS. AT OCTOBER 1,

2005 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD PRE-TAX

DEFERRED GAINS OF $114 MILLION AND $45 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, AND PRE-TAX DEFERRED LOSSES OF $69 MILLION

AND $147 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY

HEDGES ON FORECASTED FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTIONS.

DEFERRED AMOUNTS TO BE RECOGNIZED CHANGE WITH

MARKET CONDITIONS AND WILL BE SUBSTANTIALLY OFFSET BY CHANGES IN

THE VALUE OF THE RELATED HEDGED TRANSACTIONS. DEFERRED LOSSES

RECORDED IN AOCI FOR CONTRACTS THAT WILL MATURE IN THE NEXT

TWELVE MONTHS TOTALED $21 MILLION. THE COMPANY RECLASSIFIED

AFTER-TAX LOSSES OF $108 MILLION AND $144 MILLION FROM

AOCI TO EARNINGS DURING FISCAL 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

THESE LOSSES WERE OFFSET BY CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR

EQUIVALENT VALUE OF THE ITEMS BEING HEDGED.

AT OCTOBER 1, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 30,

2004, CHANGES IN VALUE RELATED TO CASH FLOW HEDGES INCLUDED IN

AOCI WERE A PRE-TAX GAIN OF $45 MILLION AND A PRE-TAX LOSS

OF $102 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. DURING FISCAL 2005 AND 2004,

THE COMPANY RECORDED THE CHANGE IN FAIR MARKET VALUE RELATED TO

FAIR VALUE HEDGES AND THE INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO CASH FLOW

HEDGES TO EARNINGS. THE AMOUNTS OF HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ON FAIR

VALUE AND CASH FLOW HEDGES WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR FISCAL 2005,

FISCAL 2004 AND FISCAL 2003. THE IMPACT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES ON OPERATING INCOME IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003

WAS A LOSS OF $168 MILLION, $277 MILLION AND

$273 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE NET LOSSES FROM THESE

HEDGES OFFSET CHANGES IN THE U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENT VALUE

OF THE RELATED EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

AT OCTOBER 1, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 30,

2004, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED CASH,

CASH EQUIVALENTS, INVESTMENTS, RECEIVABLES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE,

BORROWINGS AND INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK

MANAGEMENT CONTRACTS.

AT OCTOBER 1, 2005 AND SEPTEMBER 30,

2004, THE FAIR VALUES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, RECEIVABLES

AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE APPROXIMATED THE CARRYING VALUES BECAUSE OF

THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUES OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS SUBJECT TO FAIR VALUE

CREDIT CONCENTRATIONS

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY MONITORS ITS POSITIONS

WITH, AND THE CREDIT QUALITY OF, THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS THAT

ARE COUNTERPARTIES TO ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DOES NOT

ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY THE COUNTERPARTIES.

THE COMPANY WOULD NOT REALIZE A MATERIAL LOSS AS

OF OCTOBER 1, 2005 IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY

SINGLE COUNTERPARTY. THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO TRANSACTIONS ONLY

WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES THAT HAVE A CREDIT

RATING OF A- OR BETTER. THE COMPANYS CURRENT POLICY

REGARDING AGREEMENTS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTION COUNTERPARTIES

IS GENERALLY TO REQUIRE COLLATERAL IN THE EVENT CREDIT RATINGS

FALL BELOW A- OR IN THE EVENT AGGREGATE EXPOSURES EXCEED LIMITS

AS DEFINED BY CONTRACT. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY LIMITS THE

AMOUNT OF INVESTMENT CREDIT EXPOSURE WITH ANY ONE INSTITUTION.

THE COMPANYS TRADE RECEIVABLES AND

INVESTMENTS DO NOT REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT CONCENTRATION OF

CREDIT RISK AT OCTOBER 1, 2005 DUE TO THE WIDE VARIETY OF

CUSTOMERS AND MARKETS INTO WHICH THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE

SOLD, THEIR DISPERSION ACROSS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS, AND THE

DIVERSIFICATION OF THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO AMONG ISSUERS.

LEGAL MATTERS

MILNE AND DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC. V.

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC.

ON

NOVEMBER 5, 2002, CLARE MILNE, THE GRANDDAUGHTER OF A. A.

MILNE, AUTHOR OF THE WINNIE THE POOH BOOKS, AND THE

COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY DISNEY ENTERPRISES, INC.

(DEI) FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC.

(SSI) IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL

DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA. ON NOVEMBER 4, 2002, MS. MILNE

SERVED NOTICES TO SSI AND DEI TERMINATING A. A. MILNES

PRIOR GRANT OF RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH, EFFECTIVE

NOVEMBER 5, 2004, AND GRANTED ALL OF THOSE RIGHTS TO DEI.

IN THEIR LAWSUIT, MS. MILNE AND DEI SEEK A DECLARATORY

JUDGMENT, UNDER UNITED STATES COPYRIGHT LAW, THAT

MS. MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES WERE VALID; THAT

SSIS RIGHTS TO WINNIE THE POOH IN THE UNITED STATES

TERMINATED EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 5, 2004; THAT UPON

TERMINATION OF SSIS RIGHTS IN THE UNITED STATES, THE 1983

LICENSING AGREEMENT THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF THE

STEPHEN

SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT DISNEY COMPANY

LAWSUIT

TERMINATED BY OPERATION OF LAW; AND THAT, AS OF NOVEMBER 5,

2004, SSI WAS ENTITLED TO NO FURTHER ROYALTIES FOR USES OF

WINNIE THE POOH. SSI FILED (A) AN ANSWER DENYING THE

MATERIAL ALLEGATIONS OF THE COMPLAINT AND (B) COUNTERCLAIMS

SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT (I) MS. MILNES GRANT

OF RIGHTS TO DEI IS VOID AND UNENFORCEABLE AND (II) DEI

REMAINS OBLIGATED TO PAY SSI ROYALTIES UNDER THE 1983 LICENSING

AGREEMENT. SSI ALSO FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT OR,

IN THE ALTERNATIVE, FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE

COURT RULED THAT MILNES TERMINATION NOTICES ARE INVALID

AND DISMISSED SSIS COUNTERCLAIMS AS MOOT. FOLLOWING

FURTHER MOTIONS SSI FILED AN AMENDED ANSWER AND COUNTERCLAIMS

AND A THIRD-PARTY COMPLAINT AGAINST HARRIET HUNT (HEIR TO E. H.

SHEPARD, ILLUSTRATOR OF THE ORIGINAL WINNIE THE POOH STORIES),

WHO HAD SERVED A NOTICE OF TERMINATION AND A GRANT OF RIGHTS

SIMILAR TO MS. MILNES. BY ORDER DATED AUGUST 3,

2004, THE COURT GRANTED SSI LEAVE TO AMEND ITS ANSWER TO ASSERT

COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGEDLY ARISING FROM THE

MILNE AND HUNT TERMINATIONS AND THE GRANT OF RIGHTS TO DEI FOR

(A) UNLAWFUL AND UNFAIR BUSINESS PRACTICES; AND

(B) BREACH OF THE 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT. IN NOVEMBER

2004, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED A MOTION BY MILNE TO DISMISS

HER COMPLAINT FOR THE PURPOSE OF OBTAINING A FINAL APPEALABLE

ORDER OF DISMISSAL, SO AS TO PERMIT HER APPEAL TO THE COURT OF

APPEALS TO PROCEED. ORAL ARGUMENT OF THAT APPEAL WAS HEARD ON

SEPTEMBER 13, 2005.

STEPHEN SLESINGER, INC. V. THE WALT

DISNEY COMPANY.

IN THIS LAWSUIT, FILED

ON FEBRUARY 27, 1991 IN THE LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR

COURT, THE PLAINTIFF CLAIMS THAT A COMPANY SUBSIDIARY DEFRAUDED

IT AND BREACHED A 1983 LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO

CERTAIN WINNIE THE POOH PROPERTIES, BY FAILING TO ACCOUNT FOR

AND PAY ROYALTIES ON REVENUES EARNED FROM THE SALE OF WINNIE THE

POOH MOVIES ON VIDEOCASSETTE AND FROM THE EXPLOITATION OF WINNIE

THE POOH MERCHANDISING RIGHTS. THE PLAINTIFF SEEKS DAMAGES FOR

THE LICENSEES ALLEGED BREACHES AS WELL AS CONFIRMATION OF

THE PLAINTIFFS INTERPRETATION OF THE LICENSING AGREEMENT

WITH RESPECT TO FUTURE ACTIVITIES. THE PLAINTIFF ALSO SEEKS THE

RIGHT TO TERMINATE THE AGREEMENT ON THE BASIS OF THE ALLEGED

BREACHES. IF EACH OF THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS WERE TO BE

CONFIRMED IN A FINAL JUDGMENT, DAMAGES AS ARGUED BY THE

PLAINTIFF COULD TOTAL AS MUCH AS SEVERAL HUNDRED MILLION DOLLARS

AND ADVERSELY IMPACT THE VALUE TO THE COMPANY OF ANY FUTURE

EXPLOITATION OF THE LICENSED RIGHTS. ON MARCH 29, 2004, THE

COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION FOR TERMINATING

SANCTIONS AGAINST THE PLAINTIFF FOR A HOST OF DISCOVERY ABUSES,

INCLUDING THE WITHHOLDING, ALTERATION, AND THEFT OF DOCUMENTS

AND OTHER INFORMATION, AND, ON APRIL 5, 2004, DISMISSED

PLAINTIFFS CASE WITH PREJUDICE. PLAINTIFFS

SUBSEQUENT ATTEMPTS TO DISQUALIFY THE JUDGE WHO GRANTED THE

TERMINATING SANCTIONS WERE DENIED IN 2004, AND ITS MOTION FOR A

NEW TRIAL WAS DENIED ON JANUARY 26, 2005,

ALLOWING PLAINTIFF TO PROCEED WITH ITS NOTICED APPEAL FROM THE

APRIL 5, 2004, ORDER OF DISMISSAL.

-119-

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT IT IS NOT CURRENTLY

POSSIBLE TO ESTIMATE THE IMPACT IF ANY, THAT THE ULTIMATE

RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS WILL HAVE ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION OR CASH FLOWS.

THE COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH, IN SOME INSTANCES,

CERTAIN OF ITS DIRECTORS AND OFFICERS, IS A DEFENDANT OR

CO-DEFENDANT IN VARIOUS OTHER LEGAL ACTIONS INVOLVING COPYRIGHT,

BREACH OF CONTRACT AND VARIOUS OTHER CLAIMS INCIDENT TO THE

CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESSES. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT EXPECT THE

COMPANY TO SUFFER ANY MATERIAL LIABILITY BY REASON OF SUCH

ACTIONS.
