RISK FACTORS

FOR AN

ENTERPRISE AS LARGE AND COMPLEX AS THE COMPANY, A WIDE RANGE OF FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT FUTURE DEVELOPMENTS AND PERFORMANCE. IN ADDITION TO THE FACTORS AFFECTING SPECIFIC BUSINESS OPERATIONS IDENTIFIED IN CONNECTION WITH THE DESCRIPTION OF

THESE OPERATIONS AND THE FINANCIAL RESULTS OF THESE OPERATIONS ELSEWHERE IN THIS REPORT, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING OUR OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

CHANGES IN U.S., GLOBAL, OR REGIONAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE PROFITABILITY OF SOME OR ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES.

A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER REGIONS OF THE WORLD IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT DEMAND

FOR ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES, THUS REDUCING OUR REVENUE AND EARNINGS. THE MOST RECENT DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REDUCED SPENDING AT OUR PARKS AND RESORTS, PURCHASE OF AND PRICES FOR ADVERTISING ON OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND OWNED

STATIONS, PERFORMANCE OF OUR HOME ENTERTAINMENT RELEASES, AND PURCHASES OF COMPANY-BRANDED CONSUMER PRODUCTS, AND SIMILAR IMPACTS CAN BE EXPECTED SHOULD SUCH CONDITIONS RECUR. A DECLINE IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS COULD ALSO REDUCE ATTENDANCE AT OUR

PARKS AND RESORTS OR PRICES THAT MVSPS PAY FOR OUR CABLE PROGRAMMING. RECENT INSTABILITY IN EUROPEAN ECONOMIES PRESENTS RISKS OF SIMILAR IMPACTS IN OUR EUROPEAN OPERATIONS. ECONOMIC CONDITIONS CAN ALSO IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF THOSE WITH WHOM WE DO

BUSINESS TO SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO US. IN ADDITION, AN INCREASE IN PRICE LEVELS GENERALLY, OR IN PRICE LEVELS IN A PARTICULAR SECTOR SUCH AS THE ENERGY SECTOR, COULD RESULT IN A SHIFT IN CONSUMER DEMAND AWAY FROM THE ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER

PRODUCTS WE OFFER, WHICH COULD ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND, AT THE SAME TIME, INCREASE OUR COSTS. CHANGES IN EXCHANGE RATES FOR FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY REDUCE INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCREASE OUR LABOR OR SUPPLY COSTS IN

NON-UNITED STATES MARKETS, OR REDUCE THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR VALUE OF REVENUE WE RECEIVE FROM OTHER MARKETS.

CHANGES IN PUBLIC AND CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES FOR ENTERTAINMENT AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS COULD

REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BUSINESSES CREATE ENTERTAINMENT, TRAVEL OR CONSUMER PRODUCTS WHOSE SUCCESS DEPENDS SUBSTANTIALLY ON CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES

THAT CHANGE IN OFTEN UNPREDICTABLE WAYS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO CONSISTENTLY CREATE AND DISTRIBUTE FILMED ENTERTAINMENT, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ONLINE MATERIAL, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS,

HOTELS AND OTHER RESORT FACILITIES AND TRAVEL EXPERIENCES AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS THAT MEET THE CHANGING PREFERENCES OF THE BROAD CONSUMER MARKET. MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES INCREASINGLY DEPEND ON ACCEPTANCE OF OUR OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS BY CONSUMERS

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND THEIR SUCCESS THEREFORE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO SUCCESSFULLY PREDICT AND ADAPT TO CHANGING CONSUMER TASTES AND PREFERENCES OUTSIDE AS WELL AS INSIDE THE UNITED STATES. MOREOVER, WE MUST OFTEN INVEST SUBSTANTIAL

AMOUNTS IN FILM PRODUCTION, BROADCAST AND CABLE PROGRAMMING, ELECTRONIC GAMES, THEME PARK ATTRACTIONS, CRUISE SHIPS OR HOTELS AND OTHER RESORT FACILITIES BEFORE WE LEARN THE EXTENT TO WHICH THESE PRODUCTS WILL EARN CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE. IF OUR

ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND PRODUCTS DO NOT ACHIEVE SUFFICIENT CONSUMER ACCEPTANCE, OUR REVENUE FROM ADVERTISING SALES (WHICH ARE BASED IN PART ON RATINGS FOR THE PROGRAMS IN WHICH ADVERTISEMENTS AIR) OR SUBSCRIPTION FEES FOR BROADCAST AND CABLE

PROGRAMMING AND ONLINE SERVICES, FROM THEATRICAL FILM RECEIPTS OR HOME VIDEO OR ELECTRONIC GAME SALES, FROM THEME PARK ADMISSIONS, HOTEL ROOM CHARGES AND MERCHANDISE, FOOD AND BEVERAGE SALES, FROM SALES OF LICENSED CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR FROM SALES OF

OUR OTHER CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY DECLINE OR FAIL TO GROW TO THE EXTENT WE ANTICIPATE WHEN MAKING INVESTMENT DECISIONS AND THEREBY ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES.

CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND IN CONSUMER CONSUMPTION PATTERNS MAY AFFECT DEMAND FOR OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS OR THE COST OF PRODUCING OR DISTRIBUTING

PRODUCTS.

THE MEDIA ENTERTAINMENT AND INTERNET BUSINESSES IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE DEPEND SIGNIFICANTLY ON OUR ABILITY TO

ACQUIRE, DEVELOP, ADOPT AND EXPLOIT NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO DISTINGUISH OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS. IN ADDITION, NEW TECHNOLOGIES AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS, THE TIME AND MANNER IN WHICH CONSUMERS ACQUIRE AND VIEW

SOME OF OUR ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE TO ADVERTISERS FOR REACHING THEIR DESIRED MARKETS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE SUCCESS OF OUR OFFERINGS IN THE HOME ENTERTAINMENT MARKET DEPENDS IN PART ON CONSUMER PREFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO HOME

ENTERTAINMENT FORMATS, INCLUDING DVD PLAYERS AND PERSONAL VIDEO RECORDERS, AS WELL AS THE AVAILABILITY OF ALTERNATIVE HOME ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING WEB-BASED DELIVERY OF ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS. IN ADDITION, TECHNOLOGICAL

DEVELOPMENTS OFFER CONSUMERS AN EXPANDING ARRAY OF ENTERTAINMENT OPTIONS AND DELIVERY VEHICLES WHICH MAY INCLUDE OPTIONS WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY DEVELOPED, OR OPTIONS WE HAVE DEVELOPED BUT WHICH ENTAIL A SMALLER RETURN THAN WE REALIZE ON TRADITIONAL

OPTIONS. AS A RESULT, THE INCOME FROM OUR ENTERTAINMENT OFFERINGS MAY DECLINE OR INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE OR OUR EXPECTATIONS WHEN WE MAKE INVESTMENTS IN PRODUCTS.

THE SUCCESS OF OUR BUSINESSES IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE EXISTENCE AND MAINTENANCE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES WE CREATE.

THE VALUE TO US OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IS DEPENDENT ON THE SCOPE AND DURATION OF OUR

RIGHTS AS DEFINED BY APPLICABLE LAWS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD AND THE MANNER IN WHICH THOSE LAWS ARE CONSTRUED. IF THOSE LAWS ARE DRAFTED OR INTERPRETED IN WAYS THAT LIMIT THE EXTENT OR DURATION OF OUR RIGHTS, OR IF EXISTING LAWS ARE CHANGED,

OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE FROM OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY DECREASE, OR THE COST OF OBTAINING AND MAINTAINING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE.

THE UNAUTHORIZED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MAY INCREASE THE COST OF PROTECTING THESE RIGHTS OR REDUCE OUR REVENUES. NEW TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS THE CONVERGENCE OF COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION, AND

ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES, THE FALLING PRICES OF DEVICES INCORPORATING SUCH TECHNOLOGIES, AND INCREASED BROADBAND INTERNET SPEED AND PENETRATION HAVE MADE THE UNAUTHORIZED DIGITAL COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION OF OUR FILMS, TELEVISION PRODUCTIONS AND OTHER

CREATIVE WORKS EASIER AND FASTER AND ENFORCEMENT OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS MORE CHALLENGING. THERE IS EVIDENCE THAT UNAUTHORIZED USE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE ENTERTAINMENT INDUSTRY GENERALLY IS A SIGNIFICANT AND RAPIDLY GROWING

PHENOMENON. INADEQUATE LAWS OR WEAK ENFORCEMENT MECHANISMS TO PROTECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN ONE COUNTRY CAN ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE, DESPITE THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO PROTECT ITS INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS. THESE DEVELOPMENTS REQUIRE US TO DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY AGAINST UNLICENSED USE AND PRESENT THE RISK OF INCREASED LOSSES OF REVENUE AS A RESULT OF UNLICENSED DIGITAL DISTRIBUTION OF OUR

CONTENT AND SALES OF UNAUTHORIZED DVDS, BLU-RAY DISCS AND OTHER PRODUCTS.

WITH RESPECT TO INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY DEVELOPED BY

THE COMPANY AND RIGHTS ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY FROM OTHERS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF CHALLENGES TO OUR RIGHTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BY THIRD PARTIES. SUCCESSFUL CHALLENGES TO OUR RIGHTS IN INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY RESULT IN

INCREASED COSTS FOR OBTAINING RIGHTS OR THE LOSS OF THE OPPORTUNITY TO EARN REVENUE FROM THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY THAT IS THE SUBJECT OF CHALLENGED RIGHTS. THE COMPANY IS NOT AWARE OF ANY CHALLENGES TO ITS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS THAT IT

CURRENTLY FORESEES HAVING A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS OPERATIONS.

PROTECTION OF ELECTRONICALLY STORED DATA IS COSTLY AND IF OUR DATA IS COMPROMISED IN SPITE OF THIS

PROTECTION, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS, LOST OPPORTUNITIES AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION.

WE MAINTAIN INFORMATION

NECESSARY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS, INCLUDING CONFIDENTIAL AND PROPRIETARY INFORMATION AS WELL AS PERSONAL INFORMATION REGARDING OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES, IN DIGITAL FORM. DATA MAINTAINED IN DIGITAL FORM IS SUBJECT TO THE RISK OF INTRUSION,

TAMPERING AND THEFT. WE DEVELOP AND MAINTAIN SYSTEMS TO PREVENT THIS FROM OCCURRING, BUT THE DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE OF THESE SYSTEMS IS COSTLY AND REQUIRES ONGOING MONITORING AND UPDATING AS TECHNOLOGIES CHANGE AND EFFORTS TO OVERCOME SECURITY

MEASURES BECOME MORE SOPHISTICATED. MOREOVER, DESPITE OUR EFFORTS, THE POSSIBILITY OF INTRUSION TAMPERING AND THEFT CANNOT BE ELIMINATED ENTIRELY, AND RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH EACH OF THESE REMAIN. IN ADDITION, WE PROVIDE CONFIDENTIAL, PROPRIETARY AND

PERSONAL INFORMATION TO THIRD PARTIES WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO PURSUE BUSINESS OBJECTIVES. WHILE WE OBTAIN ASSURANCES THAT THESE THIRD PARTIES WILL PROTECT THIS INFORMATION AND, WHERE APPROPRIATE, MONITOR THE PROTECTIONS EMPLOYED BY THESE THIRD

PARTIES, THERE IS A RISK THE CONFIDENTIALITY OF DATA HELD BY THIRD PARTIES MAY BE COMPROMISED. IF OUR DATA SYSTEMS ARE COMPROMISED, OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS MAY BE IMPAIRED, WE MAY LOSE PROFITABLE OPPORTUNITIES OR THE VALUE OF THOSE

OPPORTUNITIES MAY BE DIMINISHED AND, AS DESCRIBED ABOVE, WE MAY LOSE REVENUE AS A RESULT OF UNLICENSED USE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. IF PERSONAL INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS OR EMPLOYEES IS MISAPPROPRIATED, OUR REPUTATION WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND

EMPLOYEES MAY BE INJURED RESULTING IN LOSS OF BUSINESS OR MORALE, AND WE MAY INCUR COSTS TO REMEDIATE POSSIBLE INJURY TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND EMPLOYEES OR TO PAY FINES OR TAKE OTHER ACTION WITH RESPECT TO JUDICIAL OR REGULATORY ACTIONS ARISING OUT OF

THE INCIDENT.

A VARIETY OF UNCONTROLLABLE EVENTS MAY REDUCE DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR INCREASE THE COST OF PROVIDING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES,

PARTICULARLY OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS, IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE GENERAL ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM. THE ENVIRONMENT FOR TRAVEL AND TOURISM, AS WELL AS DEMAND FOR OTHER ENTERTAINMENT PRODUCTS, CAN BE SIGNIFICANTLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN

THE UNITED STATES, GLOBALLY OR IN SPECIFIC REGIONS AS A RESULT OF A VARIETY OF FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING: ADVERSE WEATHER CONDITIONS ARISING FROM SHORT-TERM WEATHER PATTERNS OR LONG-TERM CHANGE OR NATURAL DISASTERS (SUCH AS EXCESSIVE

HEAT OR RAIN, HURRICANES AND EARTHQUAKES); HEALTH CONCERNS; INTERNATIONAL, POLITICAL OR MILITARY DEVELOPMENTS; AND TERRORIST ATTACKS. FOR EXAMPLE, THE EARTHQUAKE AND TSUNAMI IN JAPAN IN MARCH 2011 RESULTED IN A PERIOD OF SUSPENSION OF OUR OPERATIONS

AND THOSE OF CERTAIN OF OUR LICENSEES IN JAPAN, INCLUDING TOKYO DISNEY RESORT AND RESULTED IN A LOSS OF REVENUE FROM THOSE OPERATIONS. THESE EVENTS AND OTHERS, SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN TRAVEL AND ENERGY COSTS AND COMPUTER VIRUS ATTACKS, INTRUSIONS OR

OTHER WIDESPREAD COMPUTING OR TELECOMMUNICATIONS FAILURES, MAY ALSO DAMAGE OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR TO OBTAIN INSURANCE COVERAGE WITH RESPECT TO THESE EVENTS. IN ADDITION, WE DERIVE ROYALTIES FROM THE SALES OF OUR LICENSED

GOODS AND SERVICES BY THIRD PARTIES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF BUSINESSES OPERATED UNDER BRANDS LICENSED FROM THE COMPANY, AND WE ARE THEREFORE DEPENDENT ON THE SUCCESSES OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES FOR THAT PORTION OF OUR REVENUE. A WIDE VARIETY OF FACTORS

COULD INFLUENCE THE SUCCESS OF THOSE THIRD PARTIES AND IF NEGATIVE FACTORS SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED A SUFFICIENT NUMBER OF OUR LICENSEES, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE OBTAIN INSURANCE AGAINST THE

RISK OF LOSSES RELATING TO SOME OF THESE EVENTS, GENERALLY INCLUDING PHYSICAL DAMAGE TO OUR PROPERTY AND RESULTING BUSINESS INTERRUPTION, CERTAIN INJURIES OCCURRING ON OUR PROPERTY AND LIABILITY FOR ALLEGED BREACH OF LEGAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WHEN

INSURANCE IS OBTAINED IT IS SUBJECT TO DEDUCTIBLES, EXCLUSIONS AND LIMITS OF LIABILITY. THE TYPES AND LEVELS OF COVERAGE WE OBTAIN VARY FROM TIME TO TIME DEPENDING ON OUR VIEW OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF SPECIFIC TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS IN RELATION TO THE

COST OF OBTAINING COVERAGE FOR SUCH TYPES AND LEVELS OF LOSS.

CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING OF OUR BUSINESSES MAY

INCREASE OUR COSTS OR OTHERWISE AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

AS CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT OCCUR

WE MAY NEED TO ADJUST OUR BUSINESS STRATEGIES TO MEET THESE CHANGES OR WE MAY OTHERWISE FIND IT NECESSARY TO RESTRUCTURE OUR OPERATIONS OR PARTICULAR BUSINESSES OR ASSETS. IN ADDITION, EXTERNAL EVENTS INCLUDING ACCEPTANCE OF OUR THEATRICAL OFFERINGS

AND CHANGES IN MACRO-ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY IMPAIR THE VALUE OF OUR ASSETS. WHEN THESE CHANGES OR EVENTS OCCUR, WE MAY INCUR COSTS TO CHANGE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND MAY NEED TO WRITE DOWN THE VALUE OF ASSETS. WE ALSO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING

OR NEW BUSINESSES, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL EXPANSION OF OUR BUSINESS AND IN NEW BUSINESS LINES. IN RECENT YEARS, SUCH INVESTMENTS HAVE INCLUDED INVESTMENTS IN NEW CRUISE SHIPS, EXPANSION AND REPURPOSING OF CERTAIN OF OUR THEME PARK

ATTRACTIONS, AND DEVELOPMENT OF A RESORT FACILITY IN HAWAII. IN ADDITION, A JOINT VENTURE IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE RECENTLY BEGAN CONSTRUCTION OF A THEME PARK IN SHANGHAI, CHINA. SOME OF THESE INVESTMENTS MAY HAVE SHORT-TERM RETURNS THAT ARE NEGATIVE

OR LOW AND THE ULTIMATE BUSINESS PROSPECTS OF THE BUSINESSES MAY BE UNCERTAIN. IN ANY OF THESE EVENTS, OUR COSTS MAY INCREASE, WE MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRITE-DOWN OF ASSETS OR RETURNS ON NEW INVESTMENTS MAY BE LOWER THAN

PRIOR TO THE CHANGE IN STRATEGY OR RESTRUCTURING.

TURMOIL IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS COULD INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND IMPEDE ACCESS TO OR INCREASE

THE COST OF FINANCING OUR OPERATIONS AND INVESTMENTS.

PAST DISRUPTIONS IN THE U.S. AND GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS

MADE IT DIFFICULT FOR MANY BUSINESSES TO OBTAIN FINANCING ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS. IN ADDITION, EQUITY MARKETS HAVE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED RAPID AND WIDE FLUCTUATIONS IN VALUE. THESE CONDITIONS TENDED TO INCREASE THE COST OF BORROWING AND IF THEY RECUR,

OUR COST OF BORROWING COULD INCREASE AND IT MAY BE MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN FINANCING FOR OUR OPERATIONS OR INVESTMENTS. IN ADDITION, OUR BORROWING COSTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY SHORT AND LONG-TERM DEBT RATINGS ASSIGNED BY INDEPENDENT RATING AGENCIES

WHICH ARE BASED, IN SIGNIFICANT PART, ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AS MEASURED BY CREDIT METRICS SUCH AS INTEREST COVERAGE AND LEVERAGE RATIOS. A DECREASE IN THESE RATINGS WOULD LIKELY INCREASE OUR COST OF BORROWING AND/OR MAKE IT MORE

DIFFICULT FOR US TO OBTAIN FINANCING. PAST DISRUPTIONS IN THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS ALSO IMPACTED SOME OF THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WITH WHICH WE DO BUSINESS. A SIMILAR DECLINE IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS COULD AFFECT

OUR ABILITY TO SECURE CREDIT-WORTHY COUNTERPARTIES FOR OUR INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGING PROGRAMS AND COULD AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO SETTLE EXISTING CONTRACTS.

INCREASED COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR INCREASE OUR COSTS.

WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION IN EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES FROM ALTERNATIVE PROVIDERS OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER AND FROM OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATIONAL

ACTIVITIES. WE ALSO MUST COMPETE TO OBTAIN HUMAN RESOURCES, PROGRAMMING AND OTHER RESOURCES WE REQUIRE IN OPERATING OUR BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS, STATIONS AND ONLINE OFFERINGS COMPETE FOR VIEWERS WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES AS WELL AS WITH

HOME VIDEO PRODUCTS AND INTERNET USAGE.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND STATIONS COMPETE FOR THE SALE OF ADVERTISING TIME WITH OTHER BROADCAST, CABLE AND SATELLITE SERVICES, AND THE

INTERNET, AS WELL AS WITH NEWSPAPERS, MAGAZINES AND BILLBOARDS.



OUR CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR CARRIAGE OF THEIR PROGRAMMING WITH OTHER PROGRAMMING PROVIDERS.



OUR BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS COMPETE FOR THE ACQUISITION OF CREATIVE TALENT AND SPORTS AND OTHER PROGRAMMING WITH OTHER BROADCAST AND CABLE

NETWORKS.



OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS COMPETE FOR GUESTS WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, LODGING, TOURISM AND RECREATION ACTIVITIES.



OUR STUDIO OPERATIONS COMPETE FOR CUSTOMERS WITH ALL OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT.



OUR STUDIO OPERATIONS, BROADCAST AND CABLE NETWORKS AND PUBLISHING BUSINESSES COMPETE TO OBTAIN CREATIVE AND PERFORMING TALENT, STORY PROPERTIES,

ADVERTISER SUPPORT, BROADCAST RIGHTS AND MARKET SHARE.



OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT COMPETES IN THE CHARACTER MERCHANDISING AND OTHER LICENSING, PUBLISHING, AND RETAIL ACTIVITIES WITH OTHER LICENSORS,

PUBLISHERS AND RETAILERS OF CHARACTER, BRAND AND CELEBRITY NAMES.



OUR INTERACTIVE GAME OPERATIONS COMPETE WITH OTHER PUBLISHERS OF CONSOLE, ONLINE AND MOBILE GAMES AND OTHER TYPES OF HOME ENTERTAINMENT.

COMPETITION IN EACH OF THESE AREAS MAY DIVERT CONSUMERS FROM OUR CREATIVE OR OTHER PRODUCTS, OR TO OTHER

PRODUCTS OR OTHER FORMS OF ENTERTAINMENT, WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR REVENUE OR INCREASE OUR MARKETING COSTS. SUCH COMPETITION MAY ALSO REDUCE, OR LIMIT GROWTH IN, PRICES FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING ADVERTISING RATES AND SUBSCRIPTION FEES

AT OUR MEDIA NETWORKS, PARKS AND RESORTS ADMISSIONS AND ROOM RATES, AND PRICES FOR CONSUMER PRODUCTS FROM WHICH WE DERIVE LICENSE REVENUES. COMPETITION FOR THE ACQUISITION OF RESOURCES CAN INCREASE THE COST OF PRODUCING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

SUSTAINED INCREASES IN COSTS OF PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND OTHER EMPLOYEE HEALTH AND WELFARE

BENEFITS MAY REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY.

WITH APPROXIMATELY 156,000 EMPLOYEES, OUR PROFITABILITY IS SUBSTANTIALLY AFFECTED

BY COSTS OF PENSION BENEFITS AND CURRENT AND POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS. WE MAY EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN THESE COSTS AS A RESULT OF MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL, INCLUDING INCREASES IN THE COST OF HEALTH CARE.

IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN INVESTMENT RETURNS AND DISCOUNT RATES USED TO CALCULATE PENSION EXPENSE AND RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES CAN BE VOLATILE AND MAY HAVE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR COSTS IN SOME YEARS. THESE MACRO-ECONOMIC FACTORS AS WELL AS

A DECLINE IN THE FAIR VALUE OF PENSION AND POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL PLAN ASSETS MAY PUT UPWARD PRESSURE ON THE COST OF PROVIDING PENSION AND POST RETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFITS AND MAY INCREASE FUTURE FUNDING CONTRIBUTIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE ACTIVELY

SOUGHT TO CONTROL INCREASES IN THESE COSTS, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL SUCCEED IN LIMITING COST INCREASES, AND CONTINUED UPWARD PRESSURE COULD REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR RESULTS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF LONG-TERM PROGRAMMING OR CARRIAGE CONTRACTS ARE NOT RENEWED ON SUFFICIENTLY FAVORABLE TERMS.

WE ENTER INTO LONG-TERM CONTRACTS FOR BOTH THE ACQUISITION AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF MEDIA PROGRAMMING AND PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CONTRACTS

FOR THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS FOR SPORTING EVENTS AND OTHER PROGRAMS, AND CONTRACTS FOR THE DISTRIBUTION OF OUR PROGRAMMING TO MVSPS. AS THESE CONTRACTS EXPIRE, WE MUST RENEW OR RENEGOTIATE THE CONTRACTS, AND IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RENEW

THEM ON ACCEPTABLE TERMS, WE MAY LOSE PROGRAMMING RIGHTS OR DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS. EVEN IF THESE CONTRACTS ARE RENEWED, THE COST OF OBTAINING PROGRAMMING RIGHTS MAY INCREASE (OR INCREASE AT FASTER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE) OR THE REVENUE

FROM DISTRIBUTION OF PROGRAMS MAY BE REDUCED (OR INCREASE AT SLOWER RATES THAN OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE). WITH RESPECT TO THE ACQUISITION OF PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, PARTICULARLY SPORTS PROGRAMMING RIGHTS, THE IMPACT OF THESE LONG-TERM CONTRACTS ON OUR

RESULTS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACTS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING THE STRENGTH OF ADVERTISING MARKETS, EFFECTIVENESS OF MARKETING EFFORTS AND THE SIZE OF VIEWER AUDIENCES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT REVENUES FROM PROGRAMMING BASED

ON THESE RIGHTS WILL EXCEED THE COST OF THE RIGHTS PLUS THE OTHER COSTS OF PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING THE PROGRAMMING.

CHANGES IN

REGULATIONS APPLICABLE TO OUR BUSINESSES MAY IMPAIR THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR BUSINESSES.

OUR BROADCAST NETWORKS AND

TELEVISION STATIONS ARE HIGHLY REGULATED, AND EACH OF OUR OTHER BUSINESSES IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF UNITED STATES AND OVERSEAS REGULATIONS. THESE REGULATIONS INCLUDE.



UNITED STATES FCC REGULATION OF OUR TELEVISION AND RADIO NETWORKS, OUR NATIONAL PROGRAMMING NETWORKS, AND OUR OWNED TELEVISION STATIONS. SEE

ITEM 1  BUSINESS  MEDIA NETWORKS, FEDERAL REGULATION.



ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION REGULATIONS.



FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN PRIVACY AND DATA PROTECTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS.



REGULATION OF THE SAFETY OF CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND THEME PARK OPERATIONS.



IMPOSITION BY FOREIGN COUNTRIES OF TRADE RESTRICTIONS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE CONTROLS OR MOTION PICTURE OR TELEVISION CONTENT REQUIREMENTS OR QUOTAS.



DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TAX LAWS OR CURRENCY CONTROLS.

CHANGES IN ANY OF THESE REGULATORY AREAS MAY REQUIRE US TO SPEND ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS TO COMPLY WITH THE REGULATIONS, OR MAY RESTRICT OUR ABILITY TO OFFER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ARE PROFITABLE.

OUR OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY THE OPERATION OF LAWS IN THOSE JURISDICTIONS.

OUR OPERATIONS IN NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS ARE IN MANY CASES SUBJECT TO THE LAWS OF THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE RATHER THAN

UNITED STATES LAW. LAWS IN SOME JURISDICTIONS DIFFER IN SIGNIFICANT RESPECTS FROM THOSE IN THE UNITED STATES, AND THESE DIFFERENCES CAN AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO REACT TO CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS AND OUR RIGHTS OR ABILITY TO ENFORCE RIGHTS MAY BE

DIFFERENT THAN WOULD BE EXPECTED UNDER UNITED STATES LAW. MOREOVER, ENFORCEMENT OF LAWS IN SOME OVERSEAS JURISDICTIONS CAN BE INCONSISTENT AND UNPREDICTABLE, WHICH CAN AFFECT BOTH OUR ABILITY TO ENFORCE OUR RIGHTS AND TO UNDERTAKE ACTIVITIES THAT WE

BELIEVE ARE BENEFICIAL TO OUR BUSINESS. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO GENERATE REVENUE AND OUR EXPENSES IN NON-UNITED STATES JURISDICTIONS MAY DIFFER FROM WHAT WOULD BE EXPECTED IF UNITED STATES LAW GOVERNED THESE OPERATIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LABOR DISPUTES MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND ADVERSELY AFFECT THE PROFITABILITY OF ANY OF OUR

BUSINESSES.

A SIGNIFICANT NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES IN VARIOUS OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE COVERED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES OF OUR THEME PARKS AND RESORTS AS WELL AS WRITERS, DIRECTORS, ACTORS, PRODUCTION PERSONNEL AND OTHERS EMPLOYED IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS AND STUDIO OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, THE EMPLOYEES OF LICENSEES WHO MANUFACTURE AND

RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS, AND EMPLOYEES OF PROVIDERS OF PROGRAMMING CONTENT (SUCH AS SPORTS LEAGUES) MAY BE COVERED BY LABOR AGREEMENTS WITH THEIR EMPLOYERS. IN GENERAL, A LABOR DISPUTE INVOLVING OUR EMPLOYEES OR THE EMPLOYEES OF OUR

LICENSEES OR RETAILERS WHO SELL OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS OR PROVIDERS OF PROGRAMMING CONTENT MAY DISRUPT OUR OPERATIONS AND REDUCE OUR REVENUES, AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES MAY INCREASE OUR COSTS.

PROVISIONS IN OUR CORPORATE DOCUMENTS AND DELAWARE STATE LAW COULD DELAY OR PREVENT A CHANGE OF CONTROL, EVEN IF THAT CHANGE WOULD BE BENEFICIAL TO

SHAREHOLDERS.

OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION CONTAINS A PROVISION REGULATING THE ABILITY OF SHAREHOLDERS TO

BRING MATTERS FOR ACTION BEFORE ANNUAL AND SPECIAL MEETINGS AND AUTHORIZES OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ISSUE AND SET THE TERMS OF PREFERRED STOCK. THE REGULATIONS ON SHAREHOLDER ACTION COULD MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT FOR ANY PERSON SEEKING TO ACQUIRE

CONTROL OF THE COMPANY TO OBTAIN SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF ACTIONS THAT WOULD SUPPORT THIS EFFORT. THE ISSUANCE OF PREFERRED STOCK COULD EFFECTIVELY DILUTE THE INTERESTS OF ANY PERSON SEEKING CONTROL OR OTHERWISE MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN

CONTROL. IN ADDITION, PROVISIONS IN OUR RESTATED CERTIFICATE OF INCORPORATION REQUIRE SUPERMAJORITY SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF SOME ACQUISITION TRANSACTIONS AND WE ARE SUBJECT TO THE ANTI-TAKEOVER PROVISIONS OF THE DELAWARE GENERAL CORPORATION LAW,

EITHER OF WHICH COULD HAVE THE EFFECT OF DELAYING OR PREVENTING A CHANGE OF CONTROL IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES.

THE SEASONALITY OF CERTAIN OF

OUR BUSINESSES COULD EXACERBATE NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR OPERATIONS.

EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES IS NORMALLY SUBJECT TO

SEASONAL VARIATIONS, AS FOLLOWS.



REVENUES IN OUR MEDIA NETWORKS SEGMENT ARE SUBJECT TO SEASONAL ADVERTISING PATTERNS AND CHANGES IN VIEWERSHIP LEVELS. IN GENERAL, ADVERTISING REVENUES

ARE SOMEWHAT HIGHER DURING THE FALL AND SOMEWHAT LOWER DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. AFFILIATE REVENUES ARE TYPICALLY COLLECTED RATABLY THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. CERTAIN AFFILIATE REVENUES AT ESPN ARE DEFERRED UNTIL ANNUAL PROGRAMMING COMMITMENTS ARE MET,

AND THESE COMMITMENTS ARE TYPICALLY SATISFIED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE COMPANYS FISCAL YEAR, WHICH GENERALLY RESULTS IN HIGHER REVENUE RECOGNITION DURING THIS PERIOD.



REVENUES IN OUR PARKS AND RESORTS SEGMENT FLUCTUATE WITH CHANGES IN THEME PARK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY RESULTING FROM THE SEASONAL NATURE OF

VACATION TRAVEL AND LOCAL ENTERTAINMENT EXCURSIONS. PEAK ATTENDANCE AND RESORT OCCUPANCY GENERALLY OCCUR DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS WHEN SCHOOL VACATIONS OCCUR AND DURING EARLY-WINTER AND SPRING-HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR STUDIO ENTERTAINMENT SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF RELEASES IN THE THEATRICAL, HOME ENTERTAINMENT, AND

TELEVISION MARKETS. RELEASE DATES ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF VACATION AND HOLIDAY PERIODS.



REVENUES IN OUR CONSUMER PRODUCTS SEGMENT ARE INFLUENCED BY SEASONAL CONSUMER PURCHASING BEHAVIOR AND BY THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF THEATRICAL

RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS.



REVENUES IN OUR INTERACTIVE MEDIA SEGMENT FLUCTUATE DUE TO THE TIMING AND PERFORMANCE OF VIDEO GAME RELEASES WHICH ARE DETERMINED BY SEVERAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING THEATRICAL RELEASES AND CABLE PROGRAMMING BROADCASTS, COMPETITION AND THE TIMING OF HOLIDAY PERIODS. REVENUES FROM CERTAIN OF OUR INTERNET AND MOBILE OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO SIMILAR SEASONAL TRENDS.

ACCORDINGLY, IF A SHORT TERM NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR BUSINESS OCCURS DURING A TIME OF HIGH SEASONAL DEMAND (SUCH AS HURRICANE DAMAGE TO

OUR PARKS DURING THE SUMMER TRAVEL SEASON), THE EFFECT COULD HAVE A DISPROPORTIONATE EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF THAT BUSINESS FOR THE YEAR.
