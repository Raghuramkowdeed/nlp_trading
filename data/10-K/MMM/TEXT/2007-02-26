distribution
3m products are sold through numerous distribution channels, including
directly to users and through numerous wholesalers, retailers, jobbers,
distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around
the world. management believes the confidence of wholesalers, retailers,
jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3m and its products  a confidence developed through long association
with skilled marketing and sales representatives  has contributed significantly to 3ms position in
the marketplace and to its growth. 3m has 169 sales offices worldwide, with 10
in the united states and 159 internationally.
research and patents
research and product development constitutes an important part of 3ms
activities and has been a major driver of 3ms sales growth. research,
development and related expenses totaled $1.522 billion in 2006. this amount
included a $95 million in-process research and development charge (discussed in
note 2) and $75 million in restructuring actions (note 4). research,
development and related expenses totaled $1.274 billion in 2005 and $1.246
billion in 2004. research and development, covering basic scientific research
and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and
improved products and their uses, totaled $943 million in 2006, including the
$95 million for purchased in-process research and development discussed above.
research and development expenses totaled $818 million in 2005 and $792 million
in 2004. related expenses primarily include technical support provided by 3m to
existing customers who are using 3m products, and the costs of internally
developed patents.
the companys products are sold around the world under various
trademarks that are important to the company. the company also owns, or holds
licenses to use, numerous u.s. and foreign patents. the companys research and
development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered
by new patents. patents applicable to specific products extend for varying
periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and
the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is
obtained. the actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from
country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage
and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
the company believes that its patents provide an important competitive
advantage in many of its businesses. in general, no single patent or group of
related patents is in itself essential to the company as a whole or to any of
the companys business segments. the importance of patents in the display and
graphics segments is described in performance by business segment  display
and graphics business in part ii, item 7, of this form 10-k.
raw materials
in 2006, the company experienced price increases
affecting metals, wood pulp and oil-derived raw materials. during the fourth
quarter of 2006 total market demand for metals and oil-derived raw materials
began to soften and the company is therefore pursuing price reductions for
those commodities. to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of
all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements.
it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any
such shortages would have. 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing
operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and
development and
qualification of additional supply sources. 3m manages
commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection
agreements and forward physical contracts.
environmental law compliance
3ms manufacturing operations are affected by
national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3m has made, and
plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable
laws. 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental
matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to environmental and
other liabilities and insurance receivables in note 13, commitments and
contingencies).
environmental expenditures relating to existing
conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or
future revenues are expensed. reserves for liabilities for anticipated
remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable
and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility
studies or the companys commitment to a plan of action. environmental
expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future
operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives.
in 2006, 3m expended about $18 million for capital
projects related to protecting the environment. the comparable amount in 2005
was about $28 million. these amounts exclude expenditures for remediation
actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations. capital
expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices
such as wastewater treatment plant improvements, scrubbers, containment
structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers  at new and existing
facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business. consistent
with the companys policies stressing environmental responsibility, capital
expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known projects are
presently expected to be about $20million over the next two years for new
or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to
minimize waste and reduce emissions.
while the company cannot predict with certainty the
future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating
costs for environmental compliance, the company does not believe they will have
a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
position.

item 1a. risk factors.
the most
significant risk factors applicable to the company are as follows:
* results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide
economic conditions.
the company operates in more than 60 countries and derives more than 60% of its
revenues from outside the united states. the companys business may be affected
by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its
control, such as downturns in economic activity in a specific country or
region, or in the various industries in which the company operates; social,
political or labor conditions in a specific country or region; or adverse
changes in interest rates, tax, or regulations in the jurisdictions in which
the company operates.
* the
companys results are affected by competitive conditions and customer
preferences. demand
for the companys products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is
affected by (i) the development and timing of the introduction of competitive
products; (ii) the companys response to downward pricing to stay competitive;
(iii) changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory
maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be
affected by announced price changes, changes in the companys incentive
programs, or the customers ability to achieve incentive goals; and (iv)
changes in customers preferences for our products, including the success of
products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their
products that can affect the demand for some of the companys products.
* foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may
affect the companys ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and
earnings. because the
company derives more than 60% of its revenues from outside the united states,
its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be
adversely affected if the u.s. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign
currencies.
* the companys growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing
and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its
ability to renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to
market. this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or
delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new
products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market
acceptance of new products. there are no guarantees that new products will
prove to be commercially successful.
* the companys future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs
and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy, including
oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to
shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency exchange risks,
natural disasters and other factors. the company depends on various
components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas
and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products
and it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted
due to natural and other disasters and other events or be terminated in the
future. any sustained interruption in the companys receipt of adequate
supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company. in addition,
while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material
pricing, no assurance can
be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price
fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a
material adverse effect on the company.
* acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other
unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving
business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect
future results. the company
monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and
may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and
changes to its organizational structure. with respect to acquisitions, future
results will be affected by the companys ability to integrate acquired businesses
quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies.
* the companys future results may
be affected if the company generates less productivity improvements than
estimated. the company utilizes various tools, such as lean six
sigma, to improve operational efficiency and productivity. there can be no
assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized.
* the companys future results may
be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including those
involving product liability, antitrust, environmental or other matters.
the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the companys
expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters,
are often difficult to reliably predict. various factors or developments can
lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related
insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters
previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant
judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory
developments or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling, settlement
or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a
material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or cash flows in
any particular period. for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings
involving the company and the associated accounting estimates, see the
discussion in note 13.
item 1b. unresolved staff comments.
none.
item 2. properties.
3ms
general offices, corporate research laboratories, and certain division
laboratories are located in st. paul, minnesota. in the united states, 3m has
10 sales offices in eight states and operates 66 manufacturing facilities in
26states. internationally, 3m has 159 sales offices. the company operates
79 manufacturing and converting facilities in 29 countries outside the united
states.
3m owns substantially all
of its physical properties. 3ms physical facilities are highly suitable for
the purposes for which they were designed. because 3m is a global enterprise
characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, properties are often
used by multiple business segments.

the above income and earnings per share information exclude a cumulative
effect of accounting change in 2005 ($35million, or 5 cents per diluted
share). effective january 1, 2006, the company adopted statement of
financial accounting standards no. 123 (revised 2004) and used the modified
retrospective method to adjust all prior periods to give effect to the
fair-value based method of accounting for stock options. refer to note 1 for
more detail on these two items.
2006 results included net gains that increased operating income by $523
million and net income by $438 million. 2006 included net benefits from gains related to the sale of
certain portions of 3ms branded pharmaceuticals business ($1.074 billion
pre-tax, $674 million after-tax) and favorable income tax adjustments ($149 million), which were partially offset by
restructuring actions ($403 million pre-tax, $257 million after-tax), acquired
in-process research and development expenses ($95 million pre-tax and
after-tax), settlement costs of a previously disclosed antitrust class action
($40 million pre-tax, $25 million after-tax), and environmental obligations
related to the pharmaceuticals business ($13 million pre-tax, $8 million
after-tax). 2005 results included charges that reduced net income by $75
million. this related to a tax liability resulting from 3ms reinvestment of
approximately $1.7 billion of foreign earnings in the united states pursuant to
the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004. 2003
results included charges related to an adverse ruling in a lawsuit filed
against 3m in 1997 by lepages inc. that
reduced operating income by $93million ($58 million after tax). 2002
charges in connection with 3ms 2001/2002 restructuring plan reduced operating
income by $202 million ($108million after tax and minority interest).
item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition
and results of operations.
overview
3m
is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a
wide variety of products. 3m manages its operations in six operating business
segments: industrial and transportation; health care; display and graphics;
consumer and office; safety, security and protection services; and electro and
communications.
3ms strategy emphasizes
a commitment to grow at a faster pace, using a four-pronged approach, which
includes reinvesting in its core businesses, developing adjacent emerging
business opportunities, expanding on the companys already world-class
capabilities outside the united states, and acquiring companies in
faster-growing industries.
3ms
reinvestment in the core is evidenced through its 2006 investments in new
production capacity in a number of growing and highly profitable businesses,
such as medical, respiratory protection, lcd films and others. in addition, 3m
is investing in research and development, which should position our existing
business portfolio for accelerated growth.
3m launched five
new emerging business opportunities, including our track and trace initiative,
global mining, food safety, filtration, and energy. 3m made great progress on
its track and trace initiative in 2006, merging a number of formerly disparate
efforts into one single growth engine for the future. track and trace has a
growing array of applications  from tracking packages to managing medical and
legal records.
3m
continued to build its capabilities in many of the worlds fastest-growing
emerging economies in 2006. 3m began construction of three new plants in china,
one in russia, one in poland and one in india. by the end of 2007, 3m expects
to have 10 or more plants open or under construction in china. 3m also drove
outstanding growth in more developed countries. european sales growth was about
10% in u.s. dollars, and 8.3% in local currencies.
3m
closed on 19 acquisitions in 2006, all contributing to growth in different
ways. acquisitions were made to add products and gap-fillers, to expand our
offerings and become more important to our customers, to add capacity, to get access
to local markets via local brands, and to augment our existing technology base.
with a continued
focus on these strategies into 2007, 3m believes it can transform itself into a
faster-growing company.
the company expects to
increase both research and development (excluding the pharmaceuticals business,
acquired in-process research and development charge and restructuring-related
items) and capital expenditures in 2007, with investments in growth programs
around the world. research, development and related expenses totaled $1.522
billion in 2006. this included a $95 million in-process research and
development charge (discussed in note 2) and approximately $75 million in
restructuring-related items (discussed in note 4). adjusted for these items,
research, development and related expenses still increased by over 6%. total
capital expenditures for 2006 totaled $1.168 billion, up $225 million compared
with 2005. the company expects capital expenditures to total approximately $1.4
billion to $1.5 billion in 2007, providing the capacity to meet expected
growth.
3m announced in april 2006 that it would explore strategic alternatives
for its global branded pharmaceuticals business. 3m believes that in todays
very competitive pharmaceuticals marketplace, continued success in brand
pharmaceuticals requires broad pipelines of new drugs, significant investments,
and a longer-term risk-reward model than applies to most other 3m businesses.
in december 2006 and january 2007, 3m completed the sale of its branded pharmaceuticals
business. as discussed in note 2, the january 2007 transaction will be recorded
in the first quarter of 2007. as previously disclosed, 3m had indicated that it
would likely incur some restructuring-related costs associated with selling the
business.
as a
result of the above, in the fourth quarter of 2006, 3m recorded a gain on sale,
which was partially offset by restructuring and other items. including these
items, in 2006, 3m reported record
net sales of $22.923 billion and record net income of $3.851 billion, or $5.06
per diluted share, compared with net sales of $21.167 billion and net income of
$3.111 billion, or $3.98 per diluted share. excluding these items, the company
still achieved strong underlying operating performance, helped by the combination
of an 8.3% increase in net sales, including core local-currency sales growth of
5.6% (which excludes the impact of businesses acquired in the last 12
months).
in
2006, the gain on sale, net of restructuring and other items, increased
operating income by $523 million and net income by $438 million, or $0.57 per
diluted share. 2006 included net
benefits from gains related to the sale of certain portions of 3ms
branded pharmaceuticals business ($1.074 billion pre-tax, $674 million
after-tax) and favorable income tax
adjustments ($149 million), which were partially offset by restructuring
actions ($403 million pre-tax, $257 million after-tax), acquired in-process
research and development expenses ($95 million pre-tax and after-tax),
settlement costs of a previously disclosed antitrust class action ($40 million
pre-tax, $25 million after-tax), and environmental obligations related to the
pharmaceuticals business ($13 million pre-tax, $8 million after-tax). these
items are discussed in more detail in note 2 (acquisitions and divestitures),
note 4 (2006 restructuring actions), note 8 (income taxes), and note 13
(commitments and contingencies).
in 2005, 3m adopted financial accounting standards
board interpretation (fasb) no. 47, accounting for conditional asset
retirement obligations, and repatriated
approximately $1.7 billion of foreign earnings to the united states pursuant to
the provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004 (refer to note 1 and
note 8 for more detail). combined,
these two items reduced net income by $110million in 2005.
the following table contains sales and operating income results by
business segment for the years ended december31, 2006 and 2005. refer to
the performance by business segment section for discussion of the net impact of
the gain on sale, restructuring and other items that increased health care
operating income, but which reduced most of the other business segments
operating income.

3ms
sales performance in 2006 was broad-based, with all six business segments
contributing to positive local-currency sales growth. sales growth in the industrial and transportation segment was led by industrial adhesives and tapes, along with the automotive
aftermarket business. acquisitions, primarily cuno, added 4.6% to industrial
and transportation sales growth. sales growth in health care was led by 3ms
core medical and dental businesses. display and graphics sales growth
was led by display enhancement films used
in flat-panel devices and strong growth in the commercial graphics business.
sales growth in the consumer and office segment was broad-based across the many
channels 3m serves, most notably in the mass-market consumer and home
improvement retail channels. sales growth in the safety, security and
protection services segment was driven by continued strong demand for personal
protection products and solutions, particularly respiratory protection
products. acquisitions, primarily security printing and systems limited, which
was acquired in august 2006, added 4.0% to safety, security and protection
services sales growth. for the electro and communications segment, sales
growth was led by demand for 3m electronic products for semiconductor
manufacturers, along with continued strong growth in electrical products for
insulating, testing and sensing. refer to the performance by business segment
section for a more detailed discussion of the results of the respective
segments.
geographically, u.s.
sales revenue increased 7.1%, asia pacific local-currency sales (which exclude
translation impacts) increased 9.2%, european
local-currency sales increased 8.3%, and the combined latin america and canada
area local-currency sales increased 6.1%. refer to the performance by
geographic area section for a more detailed discussion of the results for the
respective areas.
operating income
improvement for the year, excluding the gain on the branded pharmaceuticals
sale and restructuring and other items, was led by the industrial and
transportation segment and the safety, security and protection services
segment. display and graphics was hurt by sales price declines, a sales mix
shift towards larger lcd displays, and operational challenges related to the
companys new optical film manufacturing production line, which have since been
resolved. the display and graphics segment and electro and communications
segment were impacted the most by business-specific restructuring actions (note
4 and business segment discussion). 3ms operating income margins remained at
healthy levels, even after adjusting for net gains related to the branded
pharmaceuticals sale, restructuring and other items.
for the year 2006, the company utilized $3.7 billion of cash to
repurchase 3m common stock and pay dividends. in august 2006, 3ms board of
directors authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases of the
companys stock, raising the total authorization to $3 billion between february
13, 2006 and february 28, 2007. as of
december 31, 2006, $748 million remained available for repurchases. in
february 2007, 3ms board authorized a dividend increase of 4.3% to 48 cents
per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.92 per share for 2007,
marking the 49thconsecutive year of dividend increases, and
also approved a $7 billion two-year share repurchase authorization for the
period from february 12, 2007 to february 28, 2009. 3ms debt to total capital
ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) as of december 31, 2006 was
26%. 3m has an aa credit rating from standard & poors and an aa1 credit
rating from moodys investors service.
in 2006, the company experienced price increases
affecting metals, wood pulp and oil-derived raw materials. during the fourth
quarter of 2006 total market demand for metals and oil-derived raw materials
began to soften and the company is therefore pursuing price reductions for
those commodities. the company to
date is receiving sufficient
quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably
foreseeable production requirements, but it
is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any
such shortages would have. 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts,
price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. fluctuations
in foreign currency exchange rates also impact results, although the company
minimizes this effect through hedging about half of this impact. 3m continued,
as it has for many years, to incur expenses (insured and uninsured) in managing
its litigation and environmental contingencies.
the sale of the
pharmaceuticals business is not presented as a discontinued operation due to
the extent of the projected continuing cash flows from our contractual supply
relationship with the buyers in relation to those of the business that was
sold. therefore, it will create both a sales and profitability comparability
issue beginning with first quarter 2007 results. annual sales in 2006 for pharmaceuticals
were $774 million, and reported operating income was $1.039 billion, including
net gains of $783 million as discussed in the pharmaceuticals business
discussion that follows. sales growth in 2007 will be negatively impacted as
these pharmaceutical sales are in the base 2006 period. 3ms drug delivery
systems division will be a source of supply to the acquiring companies, with
expected annual revenues of approximately $100 million from the various
arrangements with the three buyers. such outsourcing arrangements involve a lower profitability than the
other product and service offerings of most of our existing health care
businesses.
3m restructured
many areas in parallel with divesting the global branded pharmaceuticals
business. the great majority of those costs will not be eliminated until late
in the first quarter or early in the second quarter of 2007. earnings growth is
expected to be slowest in the first quarter of 2007 due to these continued
expenses and the strong comparable first quarter in 2006. 3m expects earnings
to improve somewhat in the second quarter of 2007, and accelerate more into the
second half of the year.
beginning in 2007,
the company is modifying its long-term and short-term incentive compensation
programs to align employee and shareholder interests more closely. the companys
short-term incentive compensation plan is moving away from its quarterly
year-over-year focused profit sharing plan toward an annual bonus plan with
payouts tied principally to performance measured by the operating plan. the
company is also reducing the number of traditional stock options granted under
its long-term incentive compensation plan by reducing the number of employees
eligible to receive annual grants and by shifting a portion of the annual grant
away from traditional stock options primarily to restricted stock units. these
changes will reduce the annual dilution impact from 1.5% of total outstanding
common stock to about 1%. however, associated with the reduction in the number
of eligible employees, the company decided to provide a one-time buyout grant
to the impacted employees, which will result in increased stock-based
compensation expense in 2007. in addition, 3ms change in the vesting period for
stock options from one to three years starting with the may 2005 grant also
results in higher expense in 2007 compared with 2006. stock-based compensation
expense is expected to total $0.21 per diluted share in 2007, compared with
$0.17 per diluted share in 2006.
the preceding
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause
results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the forward-looking
statements section in item 7 and the risk factors provided in item 1a for
discussion of these risks and uncertainties).
as discussed in note 1, effective january 1, 2006, 3m adopted statement
of financial accounting standards no. 123 (revised 2004), share-based payment
(sfas no. 123r), which required 3m to expense stock-based compensation. the
company adopted sfas no. 123r using the modified retrospective method.
effective january 1, 2006, all prior periods were revised to give effect to the
fair-value-based method of accounting for awards granted in fiscal years
beginning on or after january 1, 1995. stock-based compensation expense
for the years ended december 31, 2006, 2005 and 2004 is summarized by business
segment in the table that follows.

the $45 million
increase in stock option expense in 2006, compared with 2005, is primarily due
to two reasons. first, effective january 1, 2006, accounting rules required the
acceleration of stock-based compensation expense recognition to when an
employee is eligible to retire, instead of over the entire vesting period for
these retirement-eligible employees, resulting in recognition of approximately
25 percent of the expense in the month of grant (second quarter for 3ms annual
stock option grant). second, 3m changed its vesting period from one to three
years starting with the may 2005 grant. the third and fourth quarters of 2006
include expense from both the 2005 and 2006 stock option grants, while the
third and fourth quarters of 2005 only include expense from the 2005 stock
option grant. the decrease in the 2005 expense, compared with 2004, is primarily
due to the change in 3ms option vesting period.

sales growth of 7.7% was broad-based. all business segments made positive
contributions to local-currency sales growth and have done so for three
consecutive years. acquisitions increased 2006 sales by 2.1%, driven by the
august 2005 acquisition of cuno and the august 2006 acquisition of security
printing and systems limited. refer to both the performance

cost of sales:
cost of sales increased 1.9 percentage points in 2006. approximately
1.2 percentage points of this increase related to numerous items, such as
higher raw material costs, slightly lower selling prices, and higher costs
associated with scaling up additional manufacturing capacity. in addition,
there were supply chain inefficiencies caused by capacity-constraints. finally,
we accelerated the pace of acquisitions in 2006, which increased cost of sales
slightly for the year. after these acquisitions are integrated and begin
meaningful contributions to growth, we expect positive impacts. broad-based
sales volume growth and productivity gains helped offset some of this impact.
raw material costs increased approximately 3% for 2006, compared with 2005.
restructuring and other items also negatively impacted cost of sales by $143 million,
or 0.7 percentage points. cost of
sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.
cost of sales decreased 0.8 of a percentage point in 2005. cost of
sales as a percentage of net sales benefited from the combination of improved
selling prices, favorable product mix, productivity gains, factory efficiency
and sourcing, which helped offset the impact of higher raw material prices. raw
material costs increased approximately 6% for 2005, compared with 2004.
selling, general and administrative
expenses:
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses as a percentage
of net sales increased 0.2 of a percentage point compared with the same period
in 2005. in dollars, sg&a increased $435 million, with restructuring and
other items increasing sg&a by $238 million, and other spending increasing
sg&a by $197 million. 3m continues to invest in growth-oriented sg&a as
sales and marketing costs increased faster than sales, while administrative
expenses remained relatively flat in dollars, attributable in part to
cost-control efforts.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses as a percent of
net sales decreased 0.3 of a percentage point when comparing 2005 with 2004,
primarily due to lower stock-based compensation expense driven by the change in
vesting period from one to three years (further discussed in note 1). 3m
continued to invest in growth programs and brand building throughout the
portfolio as a means of stimulating growth. sg&a in the fourth
quarter of 2005 was impacted by a pre-tax
charge of approximately $30 million in connection with settlement agreements of
one antitrust class action and two individual such actions, all involving
direct purchasers of transparent tape.
research, development and related expenses:
research, development and related expenses increased as a percent of
sales by 0.6 of a percentage point, or $248 million, when comparing 2006 with
2005, while decreasing as a percent of sales by 0.2 of a percentage point when
comparing 2005 to 2004. the 2006
spending included a $95 million in-process research and development charge
(discussed in note 2) and $75 million in restructuring actions (note 4). other spending increased approximately $78
million, representing an increase of approximately 6% compared with 2005,
reflecting 3ms continuing commitment to fund future growth for the company.
gain on sale of pharmaceuticals business:
in december 2006,
3m completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals businesses in the
united states, canada, and latin america region and the asia pacific region,
including australia and south africa. 3m received proceeds of $1.209 billion
for these transactions and recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of $1.074 billion.
in january 2007, 3m completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals
business in europe to meda ab for $817 million.
this transaction
will be reflected in 3ms financial statements for the period ending march 31,
2007. for more detail, refer to note 2.
operating income:
3m uses operating income as one of its primary business segment
performance measurement tools. operating income in 2006 was 24.8% of sales, up
from 22.9% of sales in 2005 and 21.6% of sales in 2004. operating income in
2006 included the gain on sale, restructuring and other items that benefited
operating income by $523 million, or 2.2% of net sales.

interest expense: interest expense increased in 2006 compared
with 2005, primarily related to increased short-term debt levels and higher
interest rates. interest expense increased in 2005 compared with 2004,
primarily due to higher interest rates.
interest income: interest income was lower in 2006, with lower
average cash balances partially offset by higher interest rates. interest
income was higher in 2005, benefiting primarily from higher interest rates.

the tax rate for 2006 was 30.6%, compared with 33.7% in 2005. in 2005,
the company repatriated approximately $1.7 billion of foreign earnings under
the american jobs creation act of 2004 (jobs act). refer to the following
paragraph for additional discussion. no similar repatriation occurred in 2006
since this jobs act provision only applied to 2005. as a result, the companys
tax rate decreased by 1.6% in 2006. in addition, the companys tax rate was reduced by 1.5% as a
result of a number of items (both positive and negative), including adjustments
to its reserves for tax contingencies, the sale of its pharmaceutical business
and book/tax differences on the write-off of in-process research and
development related to the brontes technologies inc. (brontes) acquisition. refer to note 2 and note 8 for
additional information.
the
effective tax rate for 2005 was 33.7%, compared with 32.5% in 2004. during 2005,
3m completed its evaluation of the repatriation provision of the american jobs
creation act of 2004 (jobs act) and repatriated approximately $1.7 billion of
foreign earnings in the united states pursuant to its provisions. the jobs act
provided 3m the opportunity to tax-effectively repatriate foreign earnings for
u.s. qualifying investments specified by 3ms domestic reinvestment plan. as a
consequence, in the second quarter of 2005, 3m recorded a tax expense of $75
million, net of available foreign tax credits, which negatively impacted
the 2005 effective worldwide tax rate by 1.6%. a half-point tax rate reduction, compared with 2004, was primarily
attributable to a combination of the effects of the medicare modernization act
and the domestic manufacturers deduction, which was a part of the jobs act.
minority interest:

minority interest expense eliminates the income or loss attributable to
non-3m ownership interests in 3m consolidated entities. 3ms most significant
consolidated entity with non-3m ownership interests is sumitomo 3m limited in
japan (3m owns 75% of sumitomo 3m limited). the decrease in 2006 related
primarily to foreign currency translation effects which reduced sumitomo 3m
limiteds operating income as reported in u.s. dollars, as the u.s. dollar
strengthened significantly against the japanese yen, compared with 2005. the
decrease in 2005 related primarily to lower net income in sumitomo 3m.
cumulative effect of accounting change:
as of december 31,
2005, the company adopted fasb interpretation no. 47, accounting for
conditional asset retirement obligations (fin 47). this accounting
standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
where the liability can be reasonably
estimated.
conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain of the companys
long-term assets. the fair value of these obligations is recorded as
liabilities on a discounted basis. over time the liabilities are accreted for
the change in the present value and the initial capitalized costs are
depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. the adoption of fin 47
resulted in the recognition of an asset retirement obligation liability of $59
million at december 31, 2005 and an after-tax charge of $35 million for 2005,
which was reflected as a cumulative change in accounting principle in the
consolidated statement of income. the pro forma effect of applying this
guidance in all prior periods presented was determined not to be material. at
december 31, 2006, the asset retirement obligation liability was $57 million.
currency effects:
3m estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging
impacts, increased net income by approximately $20 million in 2006, $115
million in 2005 and $181 million in 2004. this estimate includes the effect of
translating profits from local currencies into u.s. dollars; the impact of
currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the
united states and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including
derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.
3m estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and
losses had an immaterial impact on net income in 2006 and increased net income
by approximately $50 million in 2005 and $48 million in 2004.

the industrial and transportation segment serves a broad range of
markets, such as appliance, paper and packaging, food and beverage, personal
care and automotive. industrial and transportation products include tapes, a
wide variety of coated and non-woven abrasives, adhesives, specialty materials,
supply chain execution software solutions, closures for disposable diapers, and
components and products that are used in the manufacture, repair and
maintenance of automotive, marine, aircraft and specialty vehicles. the august
2005 acquisition of cuno adds a comprehensive line of filtration products for
the separation, clarification and purification of fluids and gases.
in 2006,
local-currency sales grew 9.1%, including 4.6% growth from acquisitions,
primarily related to the august 2005 acquisition of cuno. since cuno was
acquired in early august 2005 and is thus considered part of organic growth
effective in august 2006, the acquisition benefit reflected in 2006 only
reflects the months from january 2006 through july 2006. the industrial
adhesives and tapes business, along with the automotive aftermarket business,
which sells products to body shops for vehicle repairs, led organic sales
growth in 2006. 3m also posted good sales growth in its abrasives business and
its energy and advanced materials business. growth in the automotive oem
business continues to be impacted by softness in the u.s. domestic automotive
industry as new car builds continue to remain soft. geographically,
local-currency sales growth in dollars was strongest in the asia pacific and
europe areas. operating income increased 10.9% to $1.343 billion in 2006. operating income
included $15 million in restructuring expenses, primarily comprised of asset
impairments and severance and related benefits, which negatively impacted
operating income growth by 1.2%.
in
2005, industrial and transportation local-currency sales grew 6.5%. the august
2005 cuno acquisition, whose results are included in industrial and
transportation, added 3.1% of growth in 2005. in addition, growth was led by
the adhesives, tapes, and abrasives businesses. 3m continued to selectively
raise selling prices to offset commodity raw material price pressures. 3m sales
growth also benefited from customer-focused new products and productivity
solutions driving results. one of these new products is 3m paint replacement
film, which is an alternative to using paint around car and truck windows. in
the automotive aftermarket area, the 3m paint preparation system shortens paint changeover and cleanup time while also
reducing the use of solvents for cleaning paint guns. sales growth in
transportation was led by businesses that serve the automotive oems and auto
body repair shops, despite challenges in the u.s. oem big-3 automotive market
along with lower levels of distribution buy-in (due to cash flow trade-offs by
customers in the automotive aftermarket business). the strength of the industrial and transportation businesses helped
overcome the sales growth challenges of the personal care business. personal
care, which is 3ms diaper tape business, has experienced significant raw
material price increases in some product lines over the past year, and 3m has
elected to drive profits at the expense of volume in this business. industrial
and transportation continues to demonstrate strong operational discipline, as
operating income grew 15.4% in 2005.
in march 2005, 3ms
automotive business completed the purchase of 19% of ti&m
beteiligungsgesellschaft mbh (ti&m), the parent company of i&t
innovation technology entwicklungsund holding aktiengesellschaft (i&t), a maker
of flat flexible cable and circuitry founded in austria in 1999. 3m and i&t
intended to collaborate to deliver flat flexible wiring systems for automotive
interior applications to the global automotive market. the purchase price of
approximately $55 million is reported in 2005 as investments in the
consolidated balance sheet and as purchases of marketable securities and
investments in the consolidated statement of cash flows. due to its
distribution involvement and voting rights, the company is using equity method
accounting for its investment in ti&m. i&t
filed a petition for bankruptcy protection in 2006. as part of its agreement to
purchase the shares of ti&m, the company was granted a put option, which
gave the company the right to sell back its entire ownership interest in
ti&m to the other investors from whom 3m acquired its 19% interest. the put
option became exercisable january 1, 2007. the company exercised the put option
and has recovered approximately half of its investment from one of the other
investors. the other two ti&m investors have filed a bankruptcy petition in
austria. the company is in the process of
seeking to collect the balance of its investment.

the health care segment serves markets that include medical, surgical,
pharmaceutical, dental and orthodontic, and health information systems.
products provided to these and other markets include medical and surgical
supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, pharmaceuticals, drug
delivery systems, dental and orthodontic products, health information systems
and microbiology products. as discussed below, the global branded
pharmaceuticals business was sold in december 2006 and january 2007.
in total, the combination of the following items positively impacted
total year 2006 health care operating income by $673 million, primarily in the
fourth quarter of 2006. as discussed in note 2, in early december 2006, the
company sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the asia pacific region,
including australia and south africa. the company also sold its branded
pharmaceuticals business in the united states, canada and latin america in late
december 2006. the operating income gain related to this sale, which is
included in health care, totaled $1.074 billion. in addition, as discussed in
note 4, the health care segment for the year 2006 included $293 million in
restructuring costs, primarily employee-related severance and benefit costs. of
the $293 million, $166 million was related to the pharmaceuticals business and $15
million related to health care severance and other costs. in addition, $112 million of severance and benefit
costs were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006 related to worldwide staff
overhead reduction actions taken to streamline the companys cost structure in response to
the sale of 3ms branded pharmaceuticals business. the health care business is being charged with these
overhead costs until such overhead costs are reduced to zero through various
restructuring actions. these costs will reduce cash flows in 2007 when the
related severance is paid. health care also included $95 million of
expensed in-process research and development costs related to the brontes
acquisition and $13 million in environmental reserves related to the
pharmaceuticals business.
in 2006, health care sales were $4.011 billion. organic local-currency
growth was 5.3%, with acquisitions adding an additional 0.7% of growth. local-currency growth was led by the medical supplies and dental
businesses. 3ms pharmaceutical business was approximately 19% of health care
sales in 2006. pharmaceutical local-currency sales declined 3.5% in 2006, while
the remaining businesses 2006 local-currency sales growth increased 8.5%.
geographically, health cares local-currency sales growth in dollars was
strongest in the united states, europe and asia pacific areas. operating income
for 2006 was up 65.6%, impacted by the gain on sale of our branded
pharmaceuticals business, restructuring impacts and other items as discussed in
the preceding paragraph, which positively impacted operating income growth by
60.4%.
in 2005, health care reported local-currency sales growth of 4.2%. 3ms
core medical and dental businesses and health information systems businesses
experienced local-currency sales growth of approximately 6%. the strength of
these businesses helped overcome the sales growth challenges of the
pharmaceutical business. sales of certain products within 3ms
pharmaceuticals business, primarily comprised of prescription drugs for
inhalation, womens health, and cardiovascular conditions, declined due to
price pressure in europe and decreased demand for some of these older products.
health care continued to focus on
operational efficiency, which helped drive a 14.6% increase in operating income
in 2005.
looking
ahead, as discussed in the preceding overview section, the sale of our branded
pharmaceuticals business will impact both sales growth and operating income
margins in health care and the total company in 2007. sales growth in
2007 will be negatively impacted as significant pharmaceuticals sales will be
in the base 2006 period. in addition, health care operating income is expected to decline in 2007 by approximately 2
percentage points year-on-year, negatively impacted by this sale.  as a result, 3m believes the following
disaggregated information for 3m health cares remaining businesses (after the
sale of pharmaceuticals) and for pharmaceuticals on a stand-alone basis
provides useful information.

total, the combination of the following items positively impacted total year
2006 pharmaceuticals operating income by $783 million, primarily in the fourth
quarter of 2006. as discussed in
note 2, in early december 2006, the company sold its branded pharmaceuticals
business in the asia pacific region, including australia and south africa. the
company also sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the united states,
canada and latin america in late december 2006. the operating income gain
related to these transactions, which is included in pharmaceuticals, totaled
$1.074 billion. as discussed in note
4, $112 million of severance and benefit costs were recorded in the
fourth quarter of 2006 related to worldwide staff overhead reduction actions
taken to streamline the companys cost structure in response to the sale of 3ms branded
pharmaceuticals business. as also
discussed in note 4, the
pharmaceuticals business for total year 2006 included $97 million in
employee-related severance and benefits and $69 million of asset impairments
and other expenses. in addition, an environmental reserve of $13 million was
recognized related to the pharmaceuticals business.
in 2006, pharmaceuticals sales totaled $774 million, a local-currency
sales decrease of 3.5%. the early december 2006 sale of the branded
pharmaceuticals business in the asia pacific region negatively impacted total
year 2006 sales by approximately 0.6%. in 2005, local currency sales increased
slightly. given the relatively flat sales, operating income dollars and margins
have remained at a healthy level, even after considering the impact of net
gains related to the sale of branded pharmaceuticals in 2006.

know-how also provide a competitive advantage to 3m independent of such
patents.
in
2006, the display and graphics business posted local-currency sales growth of
6.9%. optical film sales volumes increased at double-digit rates in 2006. 3m
saw an acceleration in the lcd industry due to strong consumer demand for lcd
tvs, which drove record sales of 3ms proprietary optical films, despite
ongoing downward pricing pressure in these consumer electronic applications.
commercial graphics, a supplier of large-format graphics solutions that cut
across a range of industries, delivered strong double-digit local-currency
growth in 2006. traffic safety systems also posted solid local-currency growth.
operating income declined by 8.6%. operating income included $39 million in
restructuring expenses, primarily comprised of asset impairments and severance
and related benefits, which negatively impacted operating income growth by 3.4%. these asset impairments relate to decisions
the company made in the fourth quarter of 2006 to exit certain marginal product
lines in the touch systems and optical systems businesses. in optical film, selling price declines, the
sales mix shift towards larger lcd displays, and operational challenges related
to the companys new optical film manufacturing production line penalized operating income in 2006.
in 2005, display and graphics local-currency sales grew 4.7%, impacted
by many factors. the first half of 2005 was tempered by tough year-on-year
optical film comparisons, while 3ms traffic safety systems business awaited a
new highway funding bill in the united states and the sluggish economies in
western europe and japan held back growth in the commercial graphics business.
growth rebounded in the second half of 2005 as a new u.s. highway funding bill
was passed in july, the economies in western europe and japan started to show
some moderate growth and, as expected, 3m saw acceleration in demand for consumer
electronics, especially flat-panel lcd televisions and a more normal lcd
component inventory situation. this growth in the second half of 2005 drove
record sales of 3ms proprietary optical films and components despite growing
pricing pressure. the continued decline in lens systems for the crt rear
projection television market negatively impacted display and graphics sales
growth by approximately 3% in 2005 and negatively impacted operating income by
approximately 7.5% in 2005.

the
consumer and office segment serves markets that include consumer retail, office
retail, education, and home improvement. products provided to these and other
markets include office supply products, stationery products, construction and
home improvement products, home care products, protective material products (including consumer health care products
such as bandages), and visual
systems products.
in
2006, consumer and office local-currency sales growth of 6.1% was broad-based
across the portfolio, led by the construction and home improvement
division, which serves the do-it-yourself retail channel. 3m also posted very
good sales growth in the mass retail channel. 3m continues to penetrate large
key accounts, primarily in the united states, with an array of unique, highly
functional products featuring customer-inspired designs. operating income was
$579 million, up 3.2% year on year. 3m experienced slower sales growth in the
construction and home improvement market in the fourth quarter of 2006,
impacted by a housing slowdown in the united states that is expected to
continue into 2007. 3ms visual systems business, which traditionally has
offered analog overhead and electronic projectors and film, continued to
experience a decline and reduced overall consumer and office sales growth by
approximately 1% for the year.
in 2005, consumer and office local-currency sales increased 3.6%, with
broad-based growth across the many channels 3m serves. consumer and office
experienced solid local-currency sales growth in construction and home
improvement, home care and in its protective materials businesses. in the
fourth quarter of 2005, sales were up slightly in local-currency terms compared
with the exceptional fourth quarter of 2004, when local-currency sales
increased 8.3%, as several large retailers apparently increased their purchase
rate level to meet their objectives. the continuing decline in 3ms visual
systems business impacted sales by approximately 2% for the year. consumer and
office continues to drive success by combining unique functionality and
customer-inspired design in new and mature products such as scotch
tape, post-it notes, filtrete
filters and o-cel-o sponges. operating
income increased 9.1% in 2005.

the
safety, security and protection services segment serves a broad range of
markets that strive to increase the safety, security and productivity of
workers, facilities and systems. major product offerings include personal
protection products, safety and security products, energy control products,
cleaning and protection products for commercial establishments, and roofing
granules for asphalt shingles. in
august 2006, 3m completed the acquisition of security printing and systems
limited, a producer of finished, personalized passports and secure cards, which expands the 3m product line related to
border and civil security solutions.
in
2006, local-currency growth in the safety, security and protection services
business was up 13.2% to $2.621 billion. growth in the business continues to be
driven by strong global demand for personal safety products, especially
respiratory protection. acquisitions contributed 4.0% of growth, primarily due to
the security printing and systems limited acquisition in august 2006. 3m
continues to invest in additional respirator capacity, such as a new respirator
manufacturing facility in korea, which will serve the asia pacific region. 3m
also posted outstanding growth in the corrosion protection division, a smaller
but growing business, which supplies coatings for all types of commercial and
industrial applications in a variety of industries. 3ms roofing granules
business experienced a challenging fourth quarter, with a sales decline of
nearly 50%, resulting in sales in this business declining nearly 10% when
comparing total year 2006 with 2005. geographically,
local-currency growth was positive across all regions of the world, led by
europe and the united states. operating income increased 7.0% to $575 million in 2006. operating
income includes $10 million in restructuring expenses, primarily severance and
related benefits, which negatively impacted operating income growth by 1.9%.
in 2005, safety, security and protection services local-currency sales
growth was 6.9%, driven by broad-based growth across the business portfolio and
geographies. the continued global threat posed by terrorism, natural disasters,
sars and avian flu helped raise the awareness in the general public about the
importance of personal protective equipment, especially respiratory protection
for overall health. sales growth was driven by continued strong global demand
for personal protection products and solutions, particularly respiratory protection
products, along with strong demand for cleaning and protection products for
commercial buildings. roofing granules for asphalt shingles also showed solid
sales growth. operating income improved 15.4% in 2005.

the electro and communications segment serves the electrical, electronics and
communications industries, including electrical utilities; electrical
construction, maintenance and repair; oem electrical and electronics; computers
and peripherals; consumer electronics; telecommunications central office,
outside plant and enterprise; as well as aerospace, military, automotive and
medical markets. this segment provides products that enable the efficient transmission of
electrical power and speed the delivery of information and ideas. products
include electronic and interconnect solutions, microinterconnect systems,
high-performance fluids, high-temperature and display tapes, telecommunications
products and electrical products.
in
2006, the electro and communications business posted sales of $2.483 billion.
organic local-currency growth for 2006 of 4.2% was attributable to the
electrical and electronics markets. acquisitions contributed 1.4% to sales
growth. 3m generated good top-line growth in its electrical markets division,
which sells a number of insulating, testing and connecting products and
solutions to both power utilities and manufacturing oems. 3m also continues to
see good growth from its electronics markets business, driven by double-digit
growth in its semi-conductor and assemblies business. partially offsetting this was some sales
softness in our u.s. communications markets business due to higher copper
costs. operating income declined
by 2.1% to $438 million. operating income includes $46 million in restructuring
expenses, primarily comprised of asset impairments and severance and related
benefits, which negatively impacted operating income growth by 10.3%. operating margins continue to be impacted by
rising raw material costs, specifically copper costs, in our electrical and
telecommunications markets businesses.
in 2005, local-currency sales in electro and communications increased
4.2%, with improving end market conditions and success in developing new
applications for existing products into new applications helping the business
post its best local-currency growth since 2000. local-currency growth
accelerated in the second half of 2005, with local-currency growth in the
fourth quarter of 2005 up 10.9%. local-currency growth was led by demand for 3m
electronic products from semiconductor manufacturers, along with continued
strong growth in electrical products used for insulating, testing and sensing.
this strong sales growth helped offset weakness in the electronic solutions and
communications markets. operating margins were 19.2% in 2005, with operating
income increasing 41.5% in 2005.

while
3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results
are the most relevant measure of performance, the company also utilizes
geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. export sales are
reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are
made. a portion of the products or
components sold by 3ms operations to its customers are exported by these
customers to different geographic areas. as customers move their operations
from one geographic area to another, 3ms results will follow. thus, net sales
in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in
that geographic area.
u.s. sales revenue
increased 7.1%, as all six business segments contributed to this increase. asia
pacific local-currency sales (which exclude translation impacts) increased
9.2%. all six business segments contributed to this increase in the asia
pacific area, with optical film being the largest growth component. sales in
japan totaled approximately $2 billion, with local-currency sales up 1.5% from
2005. european local-currency sales
increased 8.3%, with good growth in industrial and transportation and safety,
security and protection services. in the combined latin america and canada
area, local-currency sales increases of 6.1% were led by industrial and
transportation, safety, security and protection services and consumer and
office. foreign currency translation positively impacted the combined
latin america and canada area sales by 4.4%, and the european area sales by
1.4%, as the u.s. dollar weakened against these currencies. foreign currency
translation had a minimal impact on asia pacific sales. for 2006, international operations represented 61.4% of 3ms sales.
since
3m sold its global branded pharmaceuticals business in december 2006 and
january 2007, both sales growth and operating income will be negatively
impacted in 2007. sales in 2006 for pharmaceuticals totaled $332 million in the
united states, $315 million in the europe, middle east and africa area, $77
million in the asia pacific area, and $50 million in the latin america and
canada area. the gain on
sale, restructuring and other items in 2006, as discussed in the preceding
overview section, increased worldwide operating income by $523 million, with
the largest impact in the united states.

employment:
employment increased by approximately 4,100 people since year-end 2005,
partially due to acquisitions, with more than 750 people added by our three
largest 2006 acquisitions alone. in addition, 3m has increased employees in
faster-growing areas of the world, such as brazil, india, russia, china and
poland, where on a local-currency basis sales increased more
than 20% in 2006. the increase in 2005 compared with 2004 of
approximately 3,000 people was primarily attributable to the august 2005
acquisition of cuno, which added approximately 2,300 employees. employment
increases at a manufacturing plant in latin america also contributed to
increases of approximately 600 people and 700 people in 2006 and 2005,
respectively. sales per employee in local
currencies increased 7.7% in 2006, approximately 3% in 2005 and approximately
7% in 2004.
capital spending/net property, plant and equipment:
the bulk of 3m capital spending historically has been in the united states,
resulting in higher net property, plant and equipment balances in the united
states. the company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and
sourcing with geographic market sales, and because more than 60% of sales are
outside the united states, this would increase production outside the united
states, helping to improve customer service and reduce working capital
requirements.
capital expenditures are expected to increase from this $1.168 billion
in 2006 to $1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in 2007. the majority of this spending
is aimed directly at accelerating top-line growth in many of our core
businesses. 3m has about 15 significant plant construction projects under way,
some adding to existing facilities and a few of the greenfield variety.
internationally, 3m is building respiratory protection capacity in russia and
korea, medical products capacity in china, an lcd plant in poland, abrasives
and tape capacity in china and india, and chemical facilities in china, just to
name a few. this is backed up by similar investments in the u.s.
critical
accounting estimates
information regarding significant accounting policies is included in
note 1. as stated in note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. management bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to
legal proceedings, the companys pension and postretirement obligations, and
asset impairments. senior management has discussed the development, selection
and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of
3ms board of directors.
legal proceedings:
the categories of claims for which the company has estimated its
probable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of
its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to
legal proceedings. please refer to the section entitled accrued liabilities
and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings (contained in legal
proceedings in note 13) for additional information about such estimates.
pension and postretirement
obligations:
3m has various
company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all u.s. employees
and many employees outside the united states. the company accounts for its
defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance
benefit plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards
(sfas) no.87, employers accounting for pensions, sfas no. 106, employers
accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions, in measuring plan
assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic
benefit cost, and sfas no. 158, employers accounting for defined benefit
pension and other postretirement benefit plans an amendment of fasb statements
no. 87, 88, 106 and 132(r), which was issued in september 2006 and effective
as of december 31, 2006. sfas no. 158 requires employers to recognize the
underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan as an
asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes
in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated
other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders equity. as a
result of the implementation of sfas no. 158, the company recognized an
after-tax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of $1.187 billion
and $513 million for the u.s. and international pension benefit plans,
respectively, and $218 million for the postretirement health care and life
insurance benefit plan.
pension benefits
associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participants
years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. two
critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets,
are important elements of expense and liability measurement. the assumed health
care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption.
see note11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in
determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
the
company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the
december 31 measurement date for the u.s. pension and postretirement benefit
plans. the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated
liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. in estimating
this rate, the company looks at
rates
of return on fixed-income investments of similar duration to the liabilities in
the plan that receive high, investment grade ratings by recognized ratings
agencies. using this methodology, the company determined a discount rate of
5.75% to be appropriate as of december31, 2006, which is an increase of
0.25 of a percentage point from the rate used as of december 31, 2005.
a significant element in
determining the companys pension expense in accordance with sfas no.87
is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for
similar allocations among asset classes. for the u.s. pension plan, the companys
assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 8.75% for 2006 and will
remain at 8.75% for 2007. refer to note 11 for information on how this rate is
determined.
as of december 31, 2005,
the company converted to the rp (retirement plans) 2000 mortality table for
calculating the year-end 2005 u.s. pension and postretirement obligations and
2006 expense. the impact of this change increased the year-end 2005 u.s.
projected benefit obligations for pension by $385 million, the year-end 2005
u.s. accumulated benefit obligations for pension by $349 million and the 2005
u.s. accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $93 million. this change
also increased pension expenses for 2006 by $64million and postretirement
expenses by $17 million.
for the year ended
december31, 2006, the company recognized total consolidated pre-tax
pension expense (after settlements, curtailments and special termination
benefits) of $347 million, up from $331million in 2005. pension expense
(before settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) is
anticipated to decrease to approximately $174million in 2007. for the
pension plans, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease in the
expected long-term rate of return on plan assets by 0.25 of a percentage point
would decrease/increase u.s. 2007 pension expense by approximately
$24million for u.s. pension plans and approximately $9 million for
international pension plans. also, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease
in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 0.25 of a percentage
point would decrease/increase 2006 pension expense by approximately $32 million
for u.s. pension plans and approximately $17 million for international pension
plans. see note11 for details of the impact of a one percentage point
change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care
benefit expense and obligation.
asset impairments:
3m net property, plant
and equipment totaled $5.9 billion as of december 31, 2006. management makes
estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements
for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. this includes
the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including
assets of acquired businesses. these estimates and assumptions are closely
monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. for
instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based
on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related
business reporting unit. during the fourth quarter of 2006, the company sold
its branded pharmaceuticals business. in exiting this business, the company
incurred $61 million of asset impairments for this business as assets that were
not sold with the transactions did not have future value to the company. during
the fourth quarter of 2006 the company also decided to exit certain product
lines, resulting in fixed and intangible asset impairment costs of $83 million.
the fair value of the assets impacted by these product exits was determined
based on discounted cash flows. see note4 for further details of the 2006
restructuring actions.
3m goodwill totaled
approximately $4.1 billion as of december 31, 2006, which, based on impairment
testing, is not impaired. impairment testing for goodwill is done at a
reporting unit level. reporting units are one level below the business segment
level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have
similar economic characteristics. the majority of goodwill relates to and is
assigned directly to a specific reporting unit. an impairment loss generally
would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets
exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. the estimated fair
value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit
multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by
using a discounted cash flow analysis.
new accounting pronouncements
in june 2006, the
financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued interpretation no. 48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes (fin
48). fin 48 prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement
recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or expected to be taken in
a tax return. this interpretation also provides guidance on derecognition of
income tax assets and liabilities, classification of current and deferred
income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for interest and penalties
associated with tax positions, accounting for income taxes in interim periods,
and income tax disclosures. this interpretation is effective as of january 1,
2007 and the cumulative effects, if any, of applying this interpretation will
be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as of january 1, 2007. the
company does not expect the adoption of fin 48 to have a material impact on 3ms
consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in september 2006,
the fasb issued sfas no. 158, employers accounting for defined benefit
pension and other postretirement plans, an amendment of fasb statements no. 87,
88, 106 and 132(r). refer to note 11
for additional information concerning this standard.
additional information
regarding other accounting pronouncements is included in note 1.
financial condition and liquidity
the
company generates significant ongoing cash flow. net debt increased slightly in
2006, primarily related to increased short-term debt supporting share
repurchase activities and acquisitions. the increase in 2005 primarily related
to the $1.36 billion cuno acquisition.

cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities at december 31, 2006, were higher compared with
december 31, 2005, due to the significant pharmaceuticals sales proceeds
received in december 2006. 3m believes its ongoing cash flows provide ample
cash to fund expected investments and capital expenditures. the company has an
aa credit rating from standard & poors and an aa1 credit rating from moodys
investors service. the company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet
currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs. the
company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the companys stock.
however, the company does have contingently convertible debt that, if
conditions for conversion are met, is convertible into shares of 3m common
stock (refer to note 10 in this document).
the companys financial condition and liquidity are strong. various assets and liabilities, including cash and
short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on
short-term liquidity needs. working
capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $1.623
billion at december 31, 2006, compared with $1.877 billion at december 31,
2005. this decrease was primarily related to an increase in debt classified as
short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt, partially offset
by increases in cash and cash equivalents, short-term marketable securities,
and inventories.
the
company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on
certain working capital assets and liabilities. these measures are not defined
under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the
same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. one of the
primary working capital measures 3m uses is
a combined index, which includes accounts receivables, inventory and accounts
payable. this combined index (defined as quarterly net sales  fourth quarter
at year-end  multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable
plus inventory less accounts payable) was 5.4 at december 31, 2006, down from
5.7 at december 31, 2005. receivables increased $264 million, or 9.3%, compared
with december 31, 2005. currency translation (due to the stronger u.s. dollar)
increased accounts receivable by $113 million year-on-year. inventories
increased $439 million, or 20.3%, compared with december 31, 2005. currency
translation increased inventories by $92 million year-on-year. accounts payable
increased $146million compared with december 31, 2005, with $53 million
of this year-on-year increase related to currency translation.
cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are
provided in the tables that follow. individual amounts in the consolidated
statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and
exchange rate impacts, which are presented separately in the cash flows. thus,
the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing
activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted
for these effects.

cash flows from
operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as
pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can
significantly impact cash flows. in 2006, cash flows provided by operating
activities decreased $365 million. this decrease was due in large part to an increase of approximately $600
million in tax payments in 2006 compared with 2005. the higher tax payments in
2006 primarily related to the companys repatriation of $1.7 billion of foreign
earnings in the united states pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs
creation act of 2004. the category other-net in the preceding table
reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts, including outstanding liabilities at december 31, 2006,
related to 3ms restructuring actions (note 4).
in
2005, cash flow was essentially flat when compared with 2004. higher net
income, higher accounts payable and increased insurance receivable collections
were offset by accounts receivable increases, inventory increases and other
items. product and other insurance receivables and claims increased cash flow
by $122 million in 2005, benefiting from the $148 million in insurance
recoveries for the breast implant matter in 2005. the category other  net in the preceding table reflects changes in
other asset and liability accounts. for example, in 2005, this category
includes the non-cash impact of adopting fin 47 ($35 million cumulative effect
of accounting change), increases in accrued liabilities (such as the $30
million increase in liability related to legal settlement agreements), and
other items.
in the third
quarter of 2006, the company made discretionary contributions totaling $200
million to its u.s. qualified pension plan. in 2005, the company made
discretionary contributions totaling $500 million to its u.s. qualified pension
plan, with $200 million contributed in the fourth quarter of 2005, and $300
million contributed in the third quarter of 2005. in the third quarter of 2004,
the company made a special pension contribution to 3ms japanese pension plan
of $155million and a discretionary contribution of $300 million to its
u.s. qualified pension plan. future contributions will depend on market
conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3m believes its strong cash flow
and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without
compromising growth opportunities.

investments in
property, plant and equipment enable growth in diverse markets, helping to meet
product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. capital expenditures were $1.168 billion in
2006, an increase of $225 million compared with 2005, as 3m invested in
a number of growing and highly profitable businesses such as medical,
respiratory protection, lcd films and others. the company expects capital expenditures to total approximately
$1.4 billion to $1.5 billion in 2007. refer to the preceding capital spending/net
property, plant and equipment section for more detail.
refer to note 2 for
information on 2006, 2005 and 2004 acquisitions. note 2 also provides
information on the proceeds from the sale of the pharmaceuticals business. the company is actively considering additional
acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may
also divest certain businesses.
purchases of marketable securities and
investments and proceeds from sale (or maturities) of marketable securities and
investments in 2006 and 2005 are primarily attributable to auction rate and
asset-backed securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. 2006
includes purchases, net of sales and maturities, of $637 million for marketable
securities. prior to 2005, purchases of and proceeds from the sale of auction
rate securities were classified as cash and cash equivalents. at december 31,
2004, the amount of such securities taken as a whole was immaterial to cash and
cash equivalents, and accordingly was not reclassified for 2004 and prior. purchases of investments in 2005 include
the purchase of 19% of ti&m beteiligungsgesellschaft mbh (discussed
previously under the industrial and transportation business segment). the
purchase price of approximately $55 million is reported as investments in the
consolidated balance sheet and as purchases of marketable securities and
investments in the consolidated statement of cash flows. additional purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance
and equity investments.

total debt at december
31, 2006, was $3.553 billion, up from $2.381 billion at year-end 2005, with the
increase primarily attributable to commercial paper issuances and the november 2006 issuance
of a three-year, $400 million, medium-term note. in 2006, the increase
in net short-term debt of $882 million includes the portion of short-term debt
with original maturities of 90 days or less, which primarily represents
commercial paper activity. the repayment of debt for maturities greater than 90
days also primarily relates to commercial paper activity. total debt was 26% of total capital (total
capital is defined as debt plus equity),
compared with 19% at year-end 2005.
debt securities,
including the companys shelf registration, its medium-term notes program,
dealer remarketable securities and convertible note, are all discussed in more
detail in note 10. 3m has a shelf registration and medium-term notes program
through which $1.5 billion of medium-term notes may be offered. in november
2006, the company issued $400 million under its medium-term notes program. in
2004, the company issued approximately $62 million in debt securities under
this program. the
medium-term notes program and shelf registration have remaining capacity of
approximately $1.038billion. the companys $350 million of dealer
remarketable securities (classified as current portion of long-term debt) were
remarketed for one year in december 2006. in addition, the company has
convertible notes with a book value of $542 million at december 31, 2006. the
next put option date for these convertible notes is november 2007. at december
31, 2006, the convertible notes, dealer remarketable securities, $62 million of
medium-term notes, and $71 million of floating rate notes are classified as
current portion of long-term debt as the result of put provisions associated
with these debt instruments. for a discussion of accounting pronouncements that
will affect accounting treatment for the convertible note, refer to note 1 for
discussion of eitf
issue no. 04-08, the
effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share and
proposed sfas no. 128r, earnings per share.
repurchases of common stock are made to support the companys
stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. on february 13, 2006, the board of directors
authorized the purchase of $2.0 billion of the companys common stock between
february 13, 2006 and february 28, 2007. on august 15, 2006, the board of
directors authorized an additional $1 billion in share repurchases, raising the
total authorization to $3 billion for the period from february 13, 2006 to
february 28, 2007. as of december 31, 2006, $748 million remained available for
repurchase. refer to the table captioned issuer purchases of equity securities
in part ii, item 5, for more information.
cash dividends
paid to stockholders totaled $1.376 billion ($1.84 per share) in 2006, $1.286
billion ($1.68 per share) in 2005 and $1.125 billion ($1.44 per share) in 2004.
3m has paid dividends since 1916. other cash
flows from financing activities include distributions to minority interests,
changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases.
liquidity:
the companys liquidity
remains strong. cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at december
31, 2006, were higher when compared with december 31, 2005, due to the
significant pharmaceuticals sales proceeds received in december 2006. primary
short-term liquidity needs are provided through u.s. commercial paper and euro
commercial paper issuances. as of december 31, 2006, outstanding total
commercial paper issued totaled $1.349 billion and averaged approximately
$1.080 billion during 2006. medium-term note shelf borrowing capacity totaled
$1.038 billion as of december 31, 2006. credit support for outstanding
commercial paper is provided by a $565 million credit agreement among a group
of primary relationship banks. in march 2005, the company replaced its 364-day
credit agreement with a five-year credit agreement with similar terms. this
$565million credit facility provides up to $115 million in letters of
credit ($98 million of which was utilized at december 31, 2006), with
provisions for increasing this limit up to $150 million. committed credit facilities of $55million
are in place across several international subsidiary locations ($9 million of
which was utilized at december 31, 2006). to benefit from the sec securities offering
reform rules applicable to well-known seasoned issuers, the company filed a shelf
registration statement on form s-3 with the sec on february 24, 2006, which
became effective automatically, to register an indeterminate amount of debt or
equity securities for future sales. no securities were issued off this shelf.
the company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this
shelf for general corporate purposes.
the company believes it unlikely that its access to the
commercial paper market will be restricted. cash and cash equivalents and
certain other current assets could provide additional liquidity to meet
near-term obligations, if necessary. at
december 31, 2006, certain debt agreements ($350 million of dealer remarketable
securities and $127million of esop debt) had ratings triggers (bbb-/baa3
or lower) that would require repayment of debt. the company currently has
aa/aa1 debt ratings. in addition, the $565 million, five-year credit agreement
requires 3m to maintain a capitalization ratio at no more than 0.60 to 1 at the
end of each quarter. this ratio is calculated as funded debt (including all
borrowed money and letters of credit utilized) to the sum of funded debt and
equity. at december 31, 2006, this ratio was approximately 0.27 to 1.
3ms
cash and cash equivalents balance at december 31, 2006 totaled $1.447 billion,
with an additional $637 million in current and long-term marketable securities.
3ms strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant
flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward. the
company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including
continual review of acquisition opportunities. 3m paid dividends of $1.376
billion in 2006, and has a long history of dividend increases. in february
2007, the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3m common
stock by 4.3% to 48 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $1.92
per share. in february 2007, 3ms board of directors also authorized a
$7 billion two-year share repurchase authorization for the period from february
12, 2007 to february 28, 2009.
in 2007, the company
expects to contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $400 million to
its u.s. and international pension plans. the company does not have a required
minimum pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2007. therefore,
the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary
significantly depending on the u.s.-plans funding status as of the 2007
measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution.
off-balance sheet
arrangements and contractual obligations:
as of december 31, 2006, the company has not utilized
special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing
arrangements. 3ms accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the consolidated
balance sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities are estimated at
approximately $25 million. 3m does not consider this amount to be material. the fair value of 3m guarantees of loans
with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.
in addition to
guarantees, 3m, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into
agreements that require 3m to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for
specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the
use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel, or claims alleging that
3m products infringe third party patents or other intellectual property. while
3ms maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be
estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on
the companys consolidated financial position or results of operations.
a summary of the companys
significant contractual obligations as of december 31, 2006, follows:

long-term debt payments
due in 2007 include $542 million of convertible notes (final maturity 2032),
$350 million of dealer remarketable securities (final maturity 2010), $62
million of medium-term notes (final maturity 2044) $42 million of floating rate
notes (final maturity 2037), and $29 million of floating rate notes (final
maturity 2027). these securities are classified as the current portion of
long-term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments.
unconditional purchase
obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is
enforceable and legally binding on the company. included in the unconditional
purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or
pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. these
estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess
of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one
year. many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3m
guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold
to customers. the company expects to receive consideration (products or
services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. the purchase obligation
amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but
represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated.
the majority of 3ms products and services are purchased as needed, with no
unconditional commitment. for this reason, these amounts will not provide a
reliable indicator of the companys expected future cash outflows on a
stand-alone basis.
as
discussed in note 11, the company does not have a required minimum pension
contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2007. thus, company contributions
to its u.s. and international pension plans are expected to be largely
discretionary in 2007 and future years. contractual capital commitments are
also included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small
part of the companys expected capital spending in 2007 and beyond.
financial instruments
the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the
ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure, interest rate
risks and commodity price risks. a financial risk management committee,
composed of senior management, provides oversight for risk management and
derivative activities. this committee determines the companys financial risk
policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument
utilization. this committee also establishes procedures for control and
valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring
and reporting.
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and
swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows
denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing
transactions. the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and
floating rate debt. to help manage borrowing costs, the company may enter into
interest rate swaps. under these arrangements, the company agrees to exchange,
at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest
amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts,
price protection agreements and forward physical contracts.
a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the companys
exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss
or benefit in after-tax earnings of financial instruments, derivatives and
underlying exposures outstanding at december 31, 2006. the model (third-party
bank dataset) used a 95% confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. the
model used analyzed seventeen currencies, interest rates related to three
currencies, and five commodities, but does not purport to represent what
actually will be experienced by the company. this model does not include
certain hedge transactions, because the company believes their inclusion would
not materially impact the results. the following table summarizes the possible
adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures.
concerning interest rates, the larger effect on earnings at december 31, 2006
is due to the companys increased floating interest rate exposure.

the global exposures
related to purchased components and materials are such that a 1% price change
would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $55 million per
year. the global energy exposure is such that a 10% price change would result
in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $35 million per year. derivative
instruments are used to hedge less than 2% of the purchased components and
materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10% of this energy
exposure.
forward-looking
statements
this annual report on form 10-k, including managements discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7, contains
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities
litigation reform act of 1995. the company may also make forward-looking
statements in other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission,
in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases. in addition, the
companys representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking
statements.
forward-looking statements relate to future events and typically
address the companys expected future business and financial performance. words
such as plan, expect, aim, believe,
project, target, anticipate, intend, estimate, will, should, could
and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such
forward-looking statements. in particular, these include statements about the
companys strategy for growth, product development, market position, future
performance or results of current or anticipated products, interest rates,
foreign exchange rates, financial results, and the outcome of contingencies,
such as legal proceedings. the company assumes no obligation to update or
revise any forward-looking statements.
forward-looking
statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events
and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual future results
and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in
any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors. discussion
of these factors is incorporated by reference from part i, item 1a, risk
factors, of this document, and should be considered an integral part of part
ii, item 7, managements
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
in
the context of item 7a, market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from
adverse changes in financial and derivative instrument market rates and prices,
such as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. the
company discusses risk management in various places throughout this document,
including discussions in item 7 concerning financial condition and liquidity,
and financial instruments, and in the notes to consolidated financial
statements (long-term debt and short-term borrowings, derivatives and other
financial instruments, and the derivatives and hedging activities accounting
policy). all derivative activity is governed by written policies, and a
value-at-risk analysis is provided for these derivatives. the company does not
have leveraged derivative positions. however, the company does have
contingently convertible debt that, if conditions for conversion are met, is convertible
into shares of 3m common stock (refer to note 10 in this document).

responsibility for financial reporting
management is responsible for the integrity and
objectivity of the financial information included in this report. the financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america. where necessary, the financial
statements reflect estimates based on managements judgment.
management has established and maintains a system of
internal accounting and other controls for the company and its subsidiaries.
this system and its established accounting procedures and related controls are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the
books and records properly reflect all transactions, that policies and
procedures are implemented by qualified personnel, and that published financial
statements are properly prepared and fairly presented. the companys system of
internal control is supported by widely communicated written policies,
including business conduct policies, which are designed to require all
employees to maintain high ethical standards in the conduct of company affairs.
internal auditors continually review the accounting and control system.
3m company
managements
report on internal control over financial reporting
management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting.
management conducted an assessment of the companys internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework established by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control  integrated framework.
based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of december 31, 2006,
the companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.
managements assessment
of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting
as of december 31, 2006 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an
independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which
is included herein.
3m company
report of independent registered public
accounting firm
to the
stockholders and board of directors of 3m company:
we have completed
integrated audits of 3m companys consolidated financial statements and of its
internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2006, in
accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board
(united states). our opinions, based on our audits, are presented below.
consolidated financial statements
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying indexpresent
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 3m company and its
subsidiaries (the company) at december 31,
2006 and 2005, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for
each of the three years in the period ended december 31, 2006 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted
in the united states of america.  these
financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management. our
responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on our audits. we conducted our audits of these
statements in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting
oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform
the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements
are free of material misstatement. an audit of financial statements includes
examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in
the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and
significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial
statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis
for our opinion.
as discussed in note 1 to
the consolidated financial statements, the company changed the manner in which
it accounts for conditional asset retirement obligations in 2005, the manner in
which it accounts for share-based compensation in 2006, and the manner in which
it accounts for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans as of
december 31, 2006.
internal control
over financial reporting
also, in our
opinion, managements assessment, included in managements report on internal
control over financial reporting in the accompanying index, that the company
maintained effective internal control over financial reporting as of december
31, 2006 based on criteria established in internal control -
integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission (coso), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. furthermore, in our opinion, the
company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of december 31, 2006, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework issued by the coso.
the companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express
opinions on managements assessment andon the effectiveness of the
companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united
states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. an audit of internal control
over financial reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal
control over financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing
and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and
performing such other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances.
we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
a companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial

the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements are an
integral part of this statement.
notes to consolidated financial statements
note 1. significant accounting
policies
consolidation: 3m is a diversified global manufacturer,
technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. all
significant subsidiaries are consolidated. all significant intercompany
transactions are eliminated. as used herein, the term 3m or company refers
to 3m company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.
foreign currency translation: local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies
outside the united states. assets and liabilities for operations in
local-currency environments are translated at year-end exchange rates. income
and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during
the year. cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity.
reclassifications:
certain amounts in the
prior years consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to
conform to the current year presentation. effective
january 1, 2006, 3m adopted statement of financial accounting standards no. 123
(revised 2004), share-based payment (sfas no. 123r), which requires 3m to
expense stock-based compensation. the company has adopted sfas no. 123r using
the modified retrospective method. effective january 1, 2006, all prior periods
were revised to give effect to the fair-value-based method of accounting for
awards granted in fiscal years beginning on or after january 1, 1995.
use of estimates:
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the
disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial
statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the
reporting period. actual results could differ from these estimates.
cash and cash equivalents: cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments
with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
investments:
investments primarily include the cash surrender value of life insurance
policies, real estate not used in the business, venture capital and equity-method
investments. unrealized gains and losses relating to investments classified as
available-for-sale are recorded as a component of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity.
inventories:
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally
determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
property,
plant and equipment:
property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal
engineering costs, are recorded at cost. depreciation of property, plant and
equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the
estimated useful lives of the assets. the estimated useful lives of buildings
and improvements primarily range from 10 to 40 years, with the majority in the
range of 20 to 40 years. the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment
primarily range from three to 15 years, with the majority in the range of five
to 10 years. fully depreciated assets are retained in property and accumulated
depreciation accounts until disposal. upon disposal, assets and related
accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less
proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to operations. property, plant
and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may
not be recoverable. an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying
amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected
to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. the amount of
the impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the assets
carrying value over its fair value. fair value is generally determined using a
discounted cash flow analysis.
goodwill: goodwill is the excess of cost of an
acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in a business combination. goodwill is not amortized. goodwill is
tested for impairment annually, and will be tested for impairment between
annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the
carrying amount may be impaired. impairment testing for goodwill is done at a
reporting unit level. reporting units are one level below the business segment
level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have
similar economic characteristics. the majority of goodwill relates to and is
assigned directly to specific reporting units. an impairment loss generally
would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets
exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. the estimated fair
value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit
multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by
using a discounted cash flow analysis. the company completed its annual
goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2006 and determined that no
goodwill was impaired.
intangible assets: intangible
assets include patents, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an
independent party. intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain
tradenames, are not amortized. intangible assets with a definite life are
amortized on a straight-line basis, with estimated useful lives ranging from one
to 20 years. indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment
annually, and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may
be impaired. intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset
(asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognized when the
carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used
in determining the fair value of the asset. the amount of the impairment loss
to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the assets carrying value over
its fair value. fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow
analysis. costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as
patents, are expensed as incurred, primarily in research, development and
related expenses.
revenue (sales) recognition: the company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of
customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk.
revenue is recognized when the risks
and rewards of ownership have substantively transferred to customers. this
condition normally is met when the product has been delivered or upon
performance of services. the company
records estimated reductions to revenue for customer and distributor
incentives, such as rebates, at the time of the initial sale. the estimated reductions
are based on the sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and
projected market conditions in the various markets served. sales, use,
value-added and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue.
the majority of 3ms sales agreements are for standard products and
services with customer acceptance occurring upon delivery of the product or
performance of the service. 3m also enters into agreements that contain
multiple elements (such as equipment, installation and service) or non-standard
terms and conditions. for multiple-element arrangements, 3m recognizes revenue
for delivered elements when it has stand-alone value to the customer, the fair
values of undelivered elements are known, customer acceptance of the delivered
elements has occurred, and there are only customary refund or return rights
related to the delivered elements. in addition to the preceding conditions,
equipment revenue is not recorded until the installation has been
completed if equipment acceptance is dependent upon installation, or if
installation is essential to the functionality of the equipment. installation
revenues are not recorded until installation has been completed. for prepaid
service contracts, sales revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over
the term of the contract, unless historical evidence indicates the costs are
incurred on other than a straight-line basis. license fee revenue is recognized
as earned, and no revenue is recognized until the inception of the license
term. on occasion, agreements will contain
milestones, or 3m will recognize revenue based on proportional performance. for
these agreements, and depending on the specifics, 3m may recognize revenue upon
completion of a substantive milestone, or in proportion to costs incurred to
date compared with the estimate of total costs to be incurred.
accounts
receivable and allowances: trade accounts receivable are
recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. the company maintains
allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other
items. the allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns is based on the
best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts
receivable and anticipated sales returns. the company determines the allowances
based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data
and historical sales returns. the company reviews the allowance for doubtful
accounts monthly. the company does not have any off-balance-sheet credit
exposure related to its customers.
advertising and merchandising: these costs are charged to operations in the year incurred, and totaled
$471 million in 2006, $457 million in 2005 and $433 million in 2004.
research, development and related expenses: these costs are charged to operations in the year
incurred and are shown on a separate line of the consolidated statement of
income. this amount included a $95 million in-process research and development
charge (discussed in note 2) and $75 million in 2006 restructuring actions
(note 4). research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research
and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and
improved products and their uses, totaled $943 million in 2006, $818 million in
2005 and $792 million in 2004. the 2006 amount includes the $95 million for
purchased in-process research and development discussed above. related expenses
primarily include technical support provided by 3m to customers who are using
existing 3m products, and internally developed patent costs, which include costs
and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents.
internal-use software: the company capitalizes direct costs of materials and services used in
the development of internal-use software. amounts capitalized are amortized on
a straight-line basis over a period of three to five years and are reported as
a component of machinery and equipment within property, plant and equipment.
environmental: environmental expenditures relating to existing
conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or
future revenues are expensed. reserves for liabilities for anticipated
remediation costs are recorded on an
undiscounted basis when they are
probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of
feasibility studies or the companys commitment to a plan of action. environmental
expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future
operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives.
income taxes: the
provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability
approach. under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the expected
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts
and tax basis of assets and liabilities. the company records a valuation
allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their
reliability exists. as of december 31, 2006, no valuation allowances were
recorded.
earnings
per share: the difference in the weighted average
shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share is
attributable to the dilution associated with the companys stock-based
compensation plans. certain management stock ownership program average options
outstanding during the years 2006, 2005 and 2004 were not included in the
computation of diluted earnings per share because they would not have had a
dilutive effect (31.5 million average options for 2006, 15.4 million average
options for 2005, and 6.6 million average options for 2004). as discussed in
note 10, the conditions for conversion related
to the companys convertible notes have never been met; accordingly, there was
no impact on 3ms diluted earnings per share. if the conditions for conversion
are met, 3m may choose to pay in cash and/or common stock; however,
if this occurs, the company has the intent and ability to settle this debt
security in cash. the computations for
basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 follow:

stock-based
compensation:
in december 2004, the
financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued sfas no. 123 (revised 2004).
sfas no. 123r supersedes apb opinion no. 25. under apb opinion no. 25, no
compensation expense is recognized for employee stock option grants if the
exercise price of the companys stock option grants is at or above the fair
market value of the underlying stock on the date of grant. under sfas no. 123r,
compensation expense is recognized for both the general employees stock
purchase plan (gespp) and the management stock ownership plan (msop). sfas no.
123r requires the determination of the fair value of the share-based
compensation at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense over
the period in which the share-based compensation vests. the company adopted
sfas no. 123r effective january 1, 2006. the company adopted sfas no. 123r
using the modified retrospective method. all prior periods have been restated
to give effect to the fair-value-based method of accounting for awards granted
in fiscal years beginning on or after january 1, 1995. the company believes
that the modified retrospective application of this standard achieves the
highest level of clarity and comparability among the presented periods. on
november 10, 2005, the fasb issued fasb staff position no. fas
123(r)-3,transition election related to accounting for the tax effects of share-based
payment awards (the fsp). the fsp provides that companies may elect to use a
specified short-cut method to calculate the historical pool of windfall tax
benefits upon adoption of sfas no. 123r. the company elected to use the short-cut
method when it adopted sfas no. 123r on january 1, 2006.
the company issues msop
options to eligible employees annually in may using the average stock price on
the grant date, which is the date of the annual stockholders meeting. in may
2005, shareholders approved 36.75 million shares
for issuance under the
msop in the form of management stock options, restricted stock, restricted
stock units and stock appreciation rights. under the plan, the company has
principally issued stock options to management employees that are granted at
market value on the date of grant. in addition to grants to management
employees, the company makes other minor stock option grants to employees, for
which vesting terms and option lives are not substantially different, and also
makes minor grants of restricted stock units and other stock-based grants.
refer to note 16 for additional information concerning the msop.
in may 1997, shareholders
approved 30 million shares for issuance under the companys gespp. the company recognized
compensation expense for gessp options of $19 million in 2006, $19 million in
2005, and $21 million in 2004. refer to note 15 for additional information
concerning the gespp.
the impact of adopting
sfas no. 123r on the companys net income is consistent with the pro forma
disclosures provided in previous financial statements. amounts previously
reported and amounts revised per sfas no. 123r for total year 2005 and 2004 are

the impact of stock-based
compensation on net income and earnings per share provided below for the years
ended december 31, 2005 and 2004, was recognized over the nominal vesting
period, whereby if an employee retired before the end of the vesting period,
the company would recognize any remaining unrecognized compensation cost at the
date of retirement. sfas no. 123r requires recognition under a non-substantive
vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an
employee is eligible to retire. 3m employees in the united states are eligible
to retire beginning at age 55 and after having completed five years of service.
approximately 25% of the number of stock-based compensation awards are made to
this population. the company changed to the non-substantive vesting period
approach for new stock compensation grants made after the companys adoption of
sfas no. 123r on january 1, 2006. therefore, primarily beginning in may 2006
with the annual msop grant, immediate expensing of those stock-based compensation
awards granted to employees eligible to retire resulted in higher compensation
expense than historically recognized in comparable prior periods. effective
with the may 2005 annual msop grant, the company changed its vesting period
from one to three years, which results in compensation expense under the may
2005 annual grant being recognized over three years. the decrease in
stock-based compensation for 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily driven by
this change in vesting period. capitalized stock-based compensation amounts
were not material for 2006, 2005 and 2004. the diluted earnings per share
impact presented below for 2005 and 2004 is computed as the difference between
restated historical per share amounts (which reflect the impact of sfas no.
123r on both net income and diluted shares) compared to the historically
reported diluted earnings per share. amounts recognized in the consolidated
financial statements with respect to stock-based compensation plans (msop and
gespp) are as follows:

the actual tax benefits
realized by the company related to the exercise of employee stock options for
2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, was $93 million, $95 million and $109
million. the company does not have a specific policy to repurchase common
shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options; however, the company has
historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability,
market trends and other factors, to satisfy stock option exercise activity.
comprehensive income: total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the consolidated statement of
changes in stockholders equity and comprehensive income. accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects
(including hedges of net investments in international companies), minimum
pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale
debt and equity securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow
hedging instruments.
derivatives and hedging activities: all
derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. the company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps,
and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with
foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. all
hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and
effective as hedges, in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting
principles. if the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes
in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are
recognized in current earnings. instruments that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings.
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives. however, the
company does have contingently convertible debt that, if conditions for
conversion are met, is convertible into shares of 3m common stock (refer to
note 10 in this document).
new accounting pronouncements
in september 2006,
the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued sfas no. 158, employers
accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, an
amendment of fasb statements no. 87, 88, 106 and 132(r). refer to note 11 for
additional information concerning this standard.
in june 2006, the fasb
issued interpretation no. 48 (fin 48), accounting for uncertainty in income
taxes, an interpretation of fasb statement no. 109. refer to note 8 for
additional information concerning this standard.
in february 2006, the
fasb issued sfas no. 155, hybrid instruments.
sfas no. 155 amends sfas no. 133 and sfas no. 140, accounting for
transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities.
sfas no. 155 also resolves issues addressed in statement 133 implementation
issue no. d1, application of statement 133 to beneficial interests in
securitized financial assets. sfas no. 155: a) permits fair value
remeasurement for any hybrid financial instrument that contains an embedded
derivative that otherwise would require bifurcation, b) clarifies which
interest-only strips and principal-only strips are not subject to the
requirements of sfas no. 133, c) establishes a requirement to evaluate
interests in securitized financial assets to identify interests that are
freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial instruments that contain
an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, d) clarifies that concentrations
of credit risk in the form of subordination are not embedded derivatives, and
e) amends sfas no. 140 to eliminate the prohibition on a qualifying special
purpose entity from holding a derivative financial instrument that pertains to
a beneficial interest other than another derivative financial instrument. sfas
no. 155 is effective for all financial instruments acquired or issued after the
beginning of an entitys first fiscal year that begins after september 15, 2006
(january 1, 2007 for 3m). the company is currently evaluating the impact of
this standard, but would not expect sfas no. 155 to have a material impact on
3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in september 2006, the
fasb issued sfas no. 157, fair value measurements. sfas no. 157 establishes a
single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring fair value, sets
out a fair value hierarchy to be used to classify the source of information
used in fair value measurements, and requires new disclosures of assets and
liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the hierarchy. sfas
no. 157 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after november 15, 2007
(january 1, 2008 for 3m) and is to be applied prospectively. the company is
currently evaluating the impacts and disclosures of this standard, but would
not expect sfas no. 157 to have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results
of operations or financial condition.
as of december 31,
2005, the company adopted fasb interpretation no. 47, accounting for
conditional asset retirement obligations (fin 47). this accounting
standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
where the liability can be reasonably estimated. conditional asset retirement
obligations exist for certain of the companys long-term assets. the fair value
of these obligations is recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis. over
time the liabilities are accreted for the change in the present value and the
initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related
assets. the adoption of fin 47 effective december 31, 2005, resulted in the
recognition of an asset retirement obligation liability of $59 million at
december 31, 2005, and an after-tax charge of $35 million for 2005, which is
reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the
consolidated statement of income. the pro forma effect of applying this
guidance in all prior periods presented was determined not to be material. at
december 31, 2006, the asset retirement obligation liability was $57 million.
in september 2004, the
fasbs emerging issues task force finalized eitf issue no. 04-08, the effect
of contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share that would
require the dilutive effect of shares from contingently convertible debt to be
included in the diluted earnings per share calculation regardless of whether
the contingency has been met. the company has $616 million in aggregate face
amount of 30-year zero coupon senior notes that are convertible into
approximately 5.8 million shares of common stock if certain conditions are met.
these conditions have never been met (see note 10). in september 2005, the fasb
revised its december 2003 exposure draft sfas no. 128r, earnings per share  an amendment of fasb
statement no. 128, anticipated to be effective for fiscal periods
ending after june 15, 2006. the proposed sfas no. 128r further addresses
contingently convertible
debt and several other
issues. unless the company takes steps to modify certain terms of this debt
security, eitf issue no. 04-08 and proposed sfas no. 128r (when effective)
would result in an increase of approximately 5.8 million shares to diluted
shares outstanding to give effect to the contingent issuance of shares. also,
using the if-converted method, net income for the diluted earnings per share
calculations would be adjusted for interest expense associated with this debt
instrument. eitf issue no. 04-08 would have been effective beginning with
the companys 2004 fourth quarter. however, due to the fasbs delay in issuing
sfas no. 128r and the companys intent and ability to settle this debt security
in cash versus the issuance of stock, the impact of the additional diluted
shares will not be included in the diluted earnings per share calculation until
the proposed sfas no. 128r is effective. when sfas no. 128r is effective, prior
periods diluted shares outstanding and diluted earnings per share amounts will
be restated to present comparable information. the estimated annual reduction
in the companys diluted earnings per share would have been approximately $.02
to $.04 per share for each of the total years 2006, 2005 and 2004. because the
impact of this standard is ongoing, the companys diluted shares outstanding
and diluted earnings per share amounts would be impacted until retirement or
modification of certain terms of this debt security.
note 2. acquisitions and
divestitures
divestitures:
in december 2006,
3m completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in the
united states, canada, and latin america region and the asia pacific region,
including australia and south africa. 3m received proceeds of $1.209 billion
for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold, a pre-tax gain of
$1.074 billion (recorded in health care business). buyer and sale price
information by region is as follows:
graceway
pharmaceuticals inc. acquired 3ms pharmaceutical operations in the united
states, canada, and latin america for $860 million.
ironbridge
capital and archer capital acquired 3ms pharmaceuticals business in the asia
pacific region, including australia and south africa for $349 million.
meda
ab acquired 3ms pharmaceuticals business in europe for $817 million in january
2007, which is not included in the financial statements for 2006 (refer to
subsequent event discussion below).
the agreements are
the result of a review of strategic options for the branded pharmaceuticals
business and its immune response modifier (irm) platform that 3m announced in
april 2006. under the agreements, the purchasers acquired regional marketing
and intellectual property rights for 3ms well-known branded pharmaceuticals,
including aldara, difflam, duromine, tambocor, maxair, metrogel-vaginal and
minitran. as part of the transaction, graceway pharmaceuticals also acquired
the rights to certain irm molecules.
in connection with
these transactions, 3m entered into agreements whereby its drug delivery
systems division became a source of supply to the acquiring companies. because
of the extent of 3m cash flows from these agreements in relation to those of
the disposed-of businesses, the operations of the branded pharmaceuticals
business are not classified as discontinued operations. see note 4 for further
discussion of the 2006 restructuring actions that resulted from the divesture of
the companys global branded pharmaceuticals business.
subsequent
event:
as discussed
above, in january 2007, 3m completed the sale of its global branded
pharmaceuticals business in europe to meda ab for $817 million. the gain on
sale, net of other anticipated restructuring costs, is estimated at $0.60 to
$0.70 per diluted share. held-for-sale assets and liabilities related to this
transaction are not material. this transaction will be reflected in 3ms
financial statements for the period ending march 31, 2007.
acquisitions:
during the 12
months ended december 31, 2006, 3m completed 19 business combinations for a
total purchase price of $888 million, net of cash acquired. purchased

not yet have revenues from its principal operations and the technology acquired
did not have any alternative future use.
this transaction resulted
in a 2006 charge of $95 million, or $0.13 per diluted share, reflecting the
write-off of acquired in-process research and development costs, which are
recognized as research, development and related expenses in the consolidated
statement of income.

note 4. 2006 restructuring actions
during 2006, the
company completed the identification
of restructuring actions to be taken and obtained approvals from the
appropriate level of management relative to the following:
pharmaceuticals
business actions  employee-related, asset impairment and other costs
pertaining to the companys exit of its branded pharmaceuticals operations.
these costs included severance and benefits for pharmaceuticals business
employees who are not obtaining employment with the buyers as well as
impairment charges associated with certain assets not transferred to the
buyers.
overhead reduction
actions  employee-related costs for severance and benefits, costs associated
with actions to reduce the companys cost structure by a similar amount as the
corporate overhead costs that had previously been allocated to the
pharmaceuticals division.
business-specific
actions  employee-related costs for severance and benefits, fixed and
intangible asset impairments, certain contractual obligations, and expenses
from the exit of certain product lines.

actions with respect to the above activities are expected to be
substantially completed in 2007 and additional charges are not expected to be
material.
in connection with this targeted restructuring plan, the company
eliminated a total of approximately 1,950 positions, which represented various
functions within the company. approximately 480 positions were pharmaceuticals
business employees, approximately 980 positions related to overhead reduction,
primarily in worldwide staff overhead, and approximately 490 positions were
business-specific reduction actions. of the 1,950 employment reductions, about
55% are in the united states, 21% in europe, 16% in latin america and canada,
and 8% in the asia pacific area.
employee-related severance charges are largely based upon distributed
employment policies and substantive severance plans and were reflected in the
quarter in which management approved the restructuring actions. severance
amounts for which affected employees were required to render service in order
to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such
benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as
expense over the employees remaining service periods.
non-cash charges in 2006 include employee-related charges of
approximately $30 million related to special termination pension and medical
benefits granted to certain u.s. eligible employees. these additional pension
and medical benefits were reflected as a component of the benefit obligation of
the companys pension and medical plans as of december 31, 2006. in addition,
the company also recorded $5 million of non-cash stock option expense due to
the reclassification of certain employees age 50 and older to retiree status,
resulting in a modification of their original stock option awards for
accounting purposes.
contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to
terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the
time the company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will
continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without
economic benefit to the company.
asset impairment charges in 2006 associated with the pharmaceuticals
business and business-specific actions include $109 million relative to
property, plant and equipment; $30 million relative to intangible assets; and
$5 million relative to other assets. impairment charges relative to intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets
carrying values over their fair values as discussed in note 1. the
pharmaceuticals business asset impairment charges are for certain assets not
transferred to the buyers and primarily relate to the write-down of the assets
to salvage value. the business-specific asset impairment charges primarily
relate to decisions the company made in the fourth quarter of 2006 to exit
certain marginal product lines in the display and graphics segment and electro
and communications segment.

in september 2006,
the fasb issued sfas no. 158, employers accounting for defined benefit
pension and other postretirement plans, an amendment of fasb statements no. 87,
88, 106 and 132(r). this standard eliminated the requirement for a minimum
pension liability adjustment that was previously required under sfas no. 87.
this standard required employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded
status of a defined benefit plan as an asset or liability in its statement of
financial position. as a result of the implementation of sfas no. 158, the
company recognized an after-tax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive
income of $1.187 billion and $513 million for the
u.s. and
international pension benefit plans, respectively, and $218 million for the
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plan. see note 11 for
additional detail.
prior to the implementation of sfas no. 158, a minimum pension liability
adjustment would be recognized annually if the accumulated benefit obligation
(abo) exceeded the fair value of pension assets, which would result in the
employer recognizing a liability that is at least equal to the unfunded abo. for
the year ended december31, 2004, the change from a minimum pension
liability within accumulated other comprehensive income to a prepaid pension
asset increased stockholders equity by $1.193billion (after-tax). this
increase was primarily the result of the assets being in excess of the
accumulated benefit obligation for the u.s. qualified plan, which caused the
minimum pension liability recorded for the years ended december 31, 2003 and
2002 to be reversed. for the year ended
december 31, 2005, the company was in a prepaid asset position for its u.s.
qualified plan.
income tax effects for cumulative translation are not significant
because no tax provision has been made for the translation of foreign currency
financial statements into u.s. dollars. reclassification adjustments are made
to avoid double counting in comprehensive income items that are also recorded
as part of net income. reclassification adjustments (other than for cash flow
hedging instruments provided in note 12) were not material.

the company is
routinely audited by tax authorities in the countries where it conducts
business and maintains a tax reserve that reflects managements estimate of the
companys probable exposure arising from such audits. to the extent the company
were to prevail in matters for which reserves have been established or be
required to pay amounts in excess of reserves, the companys tax provision in a
given financial statement period may be materially impacted. annual tax provisions
include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that may result from
examination of tax returns; however, the amount ultimately paid upon resolution
of issues may differ materially from the amount accrued.
in 2006, an audit of the
companys u.s. tax returns for years through 2001 was completed. the company
and the internal revenue service reached a final settlement for these years,
including an agreement on the amount of a refund claim to be filed by the
company. the company also substantially resolved audits in certain european
countries. in addition, the company completed the preparation and filing of its
2005 u.s. federal income tax return and the corresponding 2005 state income tax
returns. the adjustments from amounts previously estimated in the u.s. federal
and state income tax returns (both positive and negative) included lower u.s.
taxes on dividends received from the companys foreign subsidiaries. the
company also made quarterly adjustments (both positive and negative) to its
reserves for tax contingencies. considering the developments noted above and
other factors, including the impact on open audit years of the recent
resolution of issues in various audits, these reassessments resulted in a
reduction of the reserves in 2006 by $149 million, inclusive of the expected
amount of certain refund claims.
in 2005, the
company announced its intent to reinvest $1.7 billion of foreign earnings in
the united states pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act
of 2004. this act provided the company the opportunity to tax-efficiently
repatriate foreign earnings for u.s. qualifying investments specified in its
domestic reinvestment plan. as a consequence, in 2005, 3m recorded a charge of
$75 million.
the company made discretionary contributions to its
u.s. qualified pension plan of $200 million in 2006, and $500 million in 2005.
in 2004, the company made a special pension contribution to 3ms japanese
pension plan of $155million and a discretionary contribution of $300
million to its u.s. qualified pension plan. the current income tax provision includes a benefit
for the pension contributions; the deferred tax provision includes a cost for
the related temporary difference. in addition, the company implemented sfas no. 158, employers
accounting for defined
benefit pension and other postretirement plans, an
amendment of fasb statements no. 87, 88, 106 and 132(r) in 2006, as discussed
in note 11. as a result, the company recognized an after-tax decrease in
accumulated other comprehensive income. the change in the year-end deferred tax
balance includes the effect of recording this additional obligation in addition
to the annual provision for deferred income tax expense.
in june 2006, the
financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued interpretation no. 48, (fin 48),
accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, an interpretation of fasb
statement no. 109. fin 48 prescribes a more-likely-than-not threshold for
financial statement recognition and measurement of a tax position taken or
expected to be taken in a tax return. this interpretation also provides
guidance on derecognition of income tax assets and liabilities, classification
of current and deferred income tax assets and liabilities, accounting for
interest and penalties associated with tax positions, accounting for income
taxes in interim periods, and income tax disclosures. this interpretation is
effective as of january 1, 2007 and the cumulative effects, if any, of applying
this interpretation will be recorded as an adjustment to retained earnings as
of january 1, 2007. the company does not expect the adoption of fin 48 to have
a material impact on its consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.
as a result of certain employment commitments
and capital investments made by 3m, income from manufacturing activities in
certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt
from tax for years through 2014. the income tax benefits attributable to the
tax status of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $20 million (3cents
per diluted share) in 2006, $23 million (3cents per diluted share) in
2005, and $32 million (4 cents per diluted share) in 2004.
the company has
not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to
international companies that have been considered to be reinvested
indefinitely. these earnings relate to ongoing operations and were
approximately $5 billion as of december 31, 2006. because of the availability
of u.s. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to determine the income tax
liability that would be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely
reinvested.
note
9. marketable securities
during 2006, the company
invested in asset-backed securities and auction rate securities. the following
is a summary of amounts recorded on the consolidated balance sheet for
marketable securities (current and non-current) at december 31, 2006. the
company did not have any marketable securities balance at year-end 2005.

classification of
marketable securities as current or non-current is dependent upon managements
intended holding period, the securitys maturity date, or both. if management
intends to hold the securities for longer than one year, they are classified as
non-current. unrealized gains and losses were not material in 2006. gross
realized gains and gross realized losses on sales of marketable securities were
also not material. there were no impairment losses recognized on marketable
securities in 2006. cost of securities sold or reclassified use the specific
identification method. since these marketable securities are classified as
available-for-sale securities, changes in fair value will flow through other
comprehensive income, with amounts reclassified out of other comprehensive income
into earnings upon sale. other comprehensive income activity for these
securities in 2006 was not material.
the fair value of
securities in an unrealized loss position at december 31, 2006 was $86 million,
all of which have been in a loss position for less than 12 months. unrealized
losses for these securities at december 31, 2006 were not material. 3m has both
the intent and ability to hold the securities for the time necessary to recover
the cost basis.
the balance at december
31, 2006 for marketable securities and short-term investments by contractual
maturity are shown below. actual maturities may differ from contractual
maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay
obligations without prepayment penalties.

long-term debt payments due in 2007 include $542
million of convertible notes (final maturity 2032), $350 million of dealer
remarketable securities (final maturity 2010), $62 million of medium-term notes
(final maturity 2044), $42 million of floating rate notes (final maturity
2037), and $29 million of floating rate notes (final maturity 2027). the
floating rate notes are presented as other borrowings in the preceding
long-term debt table. these securities are classified as current portion of
long-term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt
instruments.
the
esop debt is serviced by dividends on stock held by the esop and by company
contributions. these contributions are not reported as interest expense, but
are reported as an employee benefit expense in the consolidated statement of
income. other borrowings includes debt held by 3ms international companies and
floating rate notes in the united states, with the long-term portion of this
debt primarily comprised of u.s. dollar floating rate debt.
at
december 31, 2006, certain debt agreements ($350 million of dealer remarketable
securities and $127million of esop debt) had ratings triggers (bbb-/baa3
or lower) that would require repayment of debt. the company currently has
aa/aa1 debt ratings. in addition, a $565 million, five-year credit agreement
requires 3m to maintain a capitalization ratio at no more than 0.60 to 1 at the
end of each quarter. this ratio is calculated as funded debt (including all
borrowed money and letters of credit utilized) to the sum of funded debt and
equity. at december 31, 2006, this ratio was approximately 0.27 to 1. at
december 31, 2006, available short-term committed lines of credit globally
totaled approximately $620million, of which $107 million was utilized. debt
covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
3m has
a medium-term notes program and shelf registration that have remaining capacity
of approximately $1.038billion at december 31, 2006. in september 2003,
the company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and
exchange commission relating to the potential offering of debt securities of up
to $1.5 billion. this shelf registration became effective in october 2003. in
december 2003, the company established under the shelf a medium-term notes
program through which up to $1.5 billion of medium-term notes may be offered.
in november 2006, 3m issued a three-year, $400 million, fixed rate note. the
company entered into an interest rate swap to convert this to a rate based on a
floating libor index. in december 2004, 3m issued a 40-year, $62 million,
floating rate note, with the rate based on a floating libor index. 3m plans to
use the net proceeds from issuances of debt securities under this registration
for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt; investments in
or extensions of credit to 3m subsidiaries; or the financing of possible
acquisitions or business expansion.
3m
may redeem its 30-year zero-coupon senior notes (the convertible notes) at
any time in whole or in part, beginning november 21, 2007, at the accreted
conversion price; however, bondholders may convert upon notification of
redemption into 9.4602 shares of 3m common stock. holders of the 30-year
zero-coupon senior notes have the option to require 3m to purchase their notes
at accreted value on november 21 in the years 2005, 2007, 2012, 2017, 2022 and
2027. in november 2005, 22,506 of the 639,000 in outstanding bonds were
redeemed, resulting in a payout from 3m of approximately $20 million. this
reduced the convertible notes face value at maturity to $616 million, which
equates to a book value of approximately $542 million at december 31, 2006. as
disclosed in a form 8-k in november 2005, 3m amended the terms of these
securities to pay cash at a rate of 2.40% per annum of the principal amount at
maturity of the companys convertible notes, which equates to 2.75% per annum
of the notes accreted value on november 21, 2005. the cash interest payments
will be made semiannually in arrears on may 22, 2006, november 22, 2006, may
22, 2007 and november 22, 2007 to holders of record on the 15th calendar day
preceding each such interest payment date.
3m
originally sold $639 million in aggregate face amount of these convertible
notes on november 15, 2002, which are convertible into shares of 3m common
stock. the gross proceeds from the offering, to be used for general corporate
purposes, were $550 million ($540 million net of issuance costs). debt issuance
costs were amortized on a straight-line basis over a three-year period
beginning in november 2002. on february 14, 2003, 3m registered these
convertible notes in a registration statement filed with the securities and
exchange commission. the terms of the convertible notes include a yield to
maturity of .50% and an initial conversion premium of 40% over the $65.00
(split-adjusted) closing price of 3m common stock on november 14, 2002. if
certain conditions for conversion (relating to the closing common stock prices
of 3m exceeding the conversion trigger price for specified periods) are met,
holders may convert each of the 30-year zero-coupon senior notes into 9.4602
shares of 3m common stock in any calendar quarter commencing after march 31,
2003. the conversion trigger price for the fourth quarter of 2006 was $120.60
per share. if the conditions for conversion are met, and 3m elects not to
settle in cash, the 30-year zero-coupon senior notes will be convertible in the
aggregate into approximately 5.8 million shares of 3m common stock. 3m may
choose to pay the
redemption
purchase price in cash and/or common stock; however, if redemption occurs, the
company has the intent and ability to settle this debt security in cash. the
conditions for conversion have never been met; accordingly, there has been no
impact on 3ms diluted earnings per share. for a discussion of accounting
pronouncements that will affect accounting treatment for the convertible notes,
refer to note 1 for discussion of eitf issue no. 04-08, the effect of
contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share and proposed sfas
no. 128r, earnings per share.
in december 2006, the
companys $350 million of dealer remarketable securities were remarketed for
one year. they were reissued with a fixed coupon rate of5.66%. these
securities, which are classified as current portion of long-term debt, were
issued in december 2000. the remarketable securities can be remarketed
annually, at the option of the dealer, for a year each time, with a final
maturity date of december 2010.
note 11.
pension and postretirement benefit plans
3m
has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all u.s.
employees and many employees outside the united states. pension benefits
associated with these plans generally are based on each participants years of
service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. in addition to
providing pension benefits, the company provides certain postretirement health
care and life insurance benefits for substantially all of its u.s. employees
who reach retirement age while employed by the company. most international
employees and retirees are covered by government health care programs. the cost
of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international
employees is not material and is combined with u.s. amounts.
the
companys pension funding policy is to deposit with independent trustees
amounts allowable by law. trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are
maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their
beneficiaries. there are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its
nature. for its u.s. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans,
the company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments
with an independent trustee.
the
company completed the acquisition of cuno during the third quarter of 2005.
cuno has several u.s. plans and an international pension plan. the u.s. plans
had a combined projected benefit obligation of $53 million and plan assets of
$42 million as of august 1, 2005. the international pension plan had a
projected benefit obligation of $13 million and plan assets of $10 million as
of august 1, 2005. these plans are included in the balances of the appropriate
u.s. and international categories in the tables that follow.
in
august 2006, the pension protection act (ppa) was signed into law in the u.s.
the ppa replaces the funding requirements for defined benefit pension plans by
subjecting defined benefit plans to 100% of the current liability funding
target. defined benefit plans with a funding status of less than 80% of the
current liability are defined as being at risk. the ppa is effective for the
2008 plan year. 3ms u.s. qualified defined benefit plans are funded in excess
of 80%, and therefore the company expects that the plans will not be subject to
the at risk funding requirements of the ppa and that the law will not have a
material impact on future contributions.
in september 2006, the
fasb issued sfas no. 158, employers accounting for defined benefit pension and
other postretirement plans, an amendment of fasb statements no. 87, 88, 106 and
132(r). this standard requires employers to recognize the underfunded or
overfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans as an
asset or liability in its statement of financial position, and recognize
changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through
accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders
equity. this standard also eliminates the requirement for additional minimum
pension liability (aml) required under sfas no. 87. as a result of the
application of sfas no. 158 as of december 31, 2006, 3m reversed assets of $2.515
billion and increased liabilities by $703 million. these liabilities were
offset to accumulated other comprehensive income and deferred taxes. as a
result of the implementation of sfas no. 158, the company recognized an
after-tax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive income of $1.187 billion
and $513 million for the u.s. and international pension benefit plans,
respectively, and $218 million for the postretirement health care and life
insurance benefit plan.

as of december 31, 2005,
the company converted to the rp (retirement plans) 2000 mortality table for
calculating the year-end 2005 u.s. pension and postretirement obligations and
2006 expense. the impact of this change increased the year-end 2005 u.s.
projected benefit obligations for pension by $385 million, the year-end 2005
u.s. accumulated benefit obligations for pension by $349 million and the 2005
u.s. accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by $93
million. this change also increased pension expenses for 2006 by
$64million and postretirement expenses by $17 million.
the company reviews
external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine
the health care trend rates for the postretirement medical plans. as of december
31, 2006, the company modified its health care trend rates assumption by
raising the rate and separating the trend rates used for plan participants less
than 65 years of age and plan participants greater than 65 years of age. the
separation of the trend rates reflects the higher costs associated with
prescription drugs in the greater than 65 age group. the assumed health care
trend rates as of december 31 are as follows:

3ms
investment strategy for its pension and postretirement plans is to manage the
plans on a going-concern basis. the primary goal of the funds is to meet the
obligations as required. the secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of
return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without subjecting
the company to an undue amount of contribution rate volatility. fund returns
are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible
within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits,
thus reducing the level of contributions 3m must make.
3m
does not buy or sell any of its own stock as a direct investment for its pension
and other postretirement benefit funds. however, due to external investment
management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3m stock.
the aggregate amount of the shares would not be considered to be material
relative to the aggregate fund percentages.
for the u.s. pension
plan, the companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 8.75%
in 2006. projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity
and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and
investment management. the companys expected long-term rate of return on u.s.
plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 44% u.s. and 15%
international equities, with an expected long-term rate of return of 8.0% for
both u.s. and international equities; 13% private equities with an expected
long-term rate of return of 13.0%; 28% fixed-income securities with an expected
long-term rate of return of 5.0%; and an additional rate of return of 0.95%
from active investment management. these assumptions result in an 8.75%
expected rate of return on an annualized basis. the plan assets earned a rate
of return in excess of 12%, 10% and 13% in 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively.
the average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25
years has been 10.0% and 12.7%, respectively.

preceding asset allocations for international plans represent the top six

approximately 90% of the total projected international benefit obligation. the
other countries asset allocations would not have a significant impact on the
information presented.
in
the third quarter of 2006, the company made discretionary contributions
totaling $200 million to its u.s. qualified pension plan. in 2007, the company
expects to contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $400 million to
its u.s. and international pension plans. the company does not have a required
minimum pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2007. therefore,
the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary
significantly depending on the u.s. plans funding status as of the 2007
measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution.
in 2005, the company transferred a portion of its
sumitomo 3m pension liabilities and assets to the japanese government, as
allowed by a japanese government program. this program allowed 3m to transfer
$145 million in pension liabilities and $74 million in pension assets to the
japanese government. the company remeasured its projected benefit obligation
and plan assets to include the effect of this transfer. as a result of the
remeasurement, the company recognized a gain of $8 million. the gain partially
offsets the 2005 net periodic benefit cost.

note 12. derivatives and other financial
instruments
the company uses interest rate swaps, currency
swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated
with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. the
information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and
financial instruments, and includes a table that recaps cash flow hedging
amounts.
foreign currency forward and option contracts: the company enters into foreign exchange forward
contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate
fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain
intercompany financing transactions. these transactions are designated as cash
flow hedges. at december 31, 2006, the company had various open foreign
exchange forward and option contracts, the majority of which had maturities of
one year or less. the settlement or extension of these derivatives will result
in reclassifications to earnings in the period during which the hedged
transactions affect earnings (from other comprehensive income). the maximum
length of time over which 3m is hedging its exposure to the variability in
future cash flows for a majority of the forecasted transactions is 12 months.
hedge ineffectiveness was not material for the years 2006, 2005 and 2004.
commodity price management: the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply
contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. the
company uses commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted
transactions to manage price volatility. the related mark-to-market gain or
loss on qualifying hedges is included in other comprehensive income to the
extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during
which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 3m has hedged its exposure to
the variability of future cash flows for certain forecasted transactions
through 2008. no significant commodity cash flow hedges were discontinued and
hedge ineffectiveness was not material during the years 2006, 2005 and 2004.
amounts recorded in accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) related to cash flow hedging instruments follow.

at december 31, 2006, the company expects to reclassify to earnings over
the next 12 months a majority of the cash flow hedging instruments after-tax
loss of $18 million (with the impact
offset by cash flows from underlying hedged items).
interest rate swaps:
the company manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate
debt. to help manage borrowing costs, the company may enter into interest rate
swaps. under these arrangements, the company
agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed
and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon
notional principal amount.
at december 31, 2006, the company had interest rate swaps designated as
fair value hedges of underlying fixed rate obligations (none at december 31,
2005). in june 2006, the company entered into a $330 million fixed-to-floating
interest rate swap to hedge the 30-year bond due in 2028. in november 2006, the
company entered into a $400 million fixed-to-floating interest rate swap
concurrent with the issuance of the three-year medium-term note due in 2009.
the mark-to-market of these fair value hedges is recorded as gains or losses in
interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss on the underlying debt
instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense. the fair value of these
interest rate swaps was $26 million as of december 31, 2006. these fair value
hedges are 100% effective and, thus, there is no impact on earnings due to
hedge ineffectiveness.
net
investment hedging: as
circumstances warrant, the company uses cross currency swaps and forwards to
hedge portions of the companys net investments in foreign operations. for
hedges that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or losses
attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in cumulative
translation within other comprehensive income. the remainder of the change in
value of such instruments is recorded in earnings.
in september 2006, the company entered into a three-year
floating-to-floating cross currency swap with a notional amount of $300
million. this transaction is a partial hedge of the companys net investment in
its japanese subsidiaries. this swap converts u.s. dollar-based variable
interest payments to yen-based variable interest payments associated with the
notional amount.
in november 2006,
the company entered into a three-year floating-to-floating
cross currency swap with a notional amount of $200 million. this
transaction is a partial hedge of the companys net investment in its european
subsidiaries. this swap converts u.s.
dollar-based variable interest payments to euro-based variable interest payments associated with the notional amount.
in december 2006, the
company entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a notional amount
of $556 million relative to the companys net investment in its european
subsidiaries and with a notional amount of $209 million relative to the companys
net investment in its japanese subsidiaries. these forwards mature in december
2007.
the
unrealized loss recorded in cumulative translation related to net investment
hedging at december 31, 2006 was $18
million and the unrealized gain at december 31, 2005 was $47 million.
currency effects: 3m estimates that
year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, increased net income
by approximately $20 million in 2006, $115 million in 2005, and $181 million in
2004. this estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local
currencies into u.s. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the
transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad; and
transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to
reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks. 3m estimates that year-on-year
derivative and other transaction gains and losses had an immaterial impact on
net income in 2006 and increased net income by approximately $50 million in
2005 and $48 million in 2004.
credit risk: the company is exposed to credit loss in the
event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency
swaps, and option and foreign exchange contracts. however, the companys risk
is limited to the fair value of the instruments. the company actively monitors
its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit
limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions
as counterparties. the company does not anticipate non-performance by any of
these counterparties. during the second quarter of 2006, the company
entered into a credit support agreement with one of its primary derivatives
counterparties. under this agreement either party is required to post eligible
collateral when the market value of transactions covered by the agreement
exceeds specified thresholds, thus limiting credit exposure for both parties.
fair value of financial instruments: at december 31, 2006
and 2005, the companys financial instruments included cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, investments, accounts
payable, borrowings, and derivative contracts. the fair values of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings
and current portion of long-term debt (except the $350 million dealer
remarketable security) approximated carrying values because of the short-term
nature of these instruments. available-for-sale marketable securities, investments
and derivative contracts are reported at fair values. fair values for
investments held at cost are not readily available, but are estimated to
approximate fair value. the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of other
financial instruments based on third-party quotes as of december 31 follow:

capital and operating leases:
rental expense under
operating leases was $211 million in 2006, $195 million in 2005, and $181
million in 2004. it is 3ms practice to secure renewal rights for leases,
thereby giving 3m the right, but not the obligation, to maintain a presence in
a leased facility. 3ms primary capital lease, which became effective in april
2003, involves a building in the united kingdom (with a lease term of 22
years). during the second quarter of 2003, 3m recorded a capital lease asset
and obligation of approximately 33.5 million united kingdom pounds
(approximately $66 million at december 31, 2006 exchange rates). minimum lease
payments under capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms in excess
of one year as of december 31, 2006, were as follows:

warranties/guarantees:
3ms accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on
the consolidated balance sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities,
are estimated at approximately $25 million as of december 31, 2006. 3m does not
consider this amount to be material. the
fair value of 3m guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee
arrangements are not material.
related party activity:
purchases
from related parties (largely related to companies in which 3m has an equity
interest) totaled approximately $160 million in 2006 ($141 million in 2005 and
$124 million in 2004). receivables due from related parties (largely related to
receivables from employees for relocation and other ordinary business expense
advances) totaled approximately $36 million in 2006 ($37 million in 2005, and
$34 million in 2004). 3m sales to related parties totaled approximately $4
million in 2006 ($5 million in 2005, and $91 million in 2004). indebtedness to
3m from related parties was not material in 2006, 2005 and 2004.
legal proceedings:
the company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims
and lawsuits, principally in the united states, and regulatory proceedings
worldwide. these include various products liability (involving products that
the company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property, and
commercial claims and lawsuits, including those brought under the antitrust
laws, and environmental proceedings. the following sections first describe the
significant legal proceedings in which the company is involved, and then describe
the liabilities and associated insurance receivables the company has accrued
relating to its significant legal proceedings. unless otherwise stated, the
company is vigorously defending all such litigation.
antitrust
litigation
as previously
reported, lepages inc., a transparent tape competitor of 3m, filed a lawsuit
against the company in june 1997 alleging that certain marketing practices of
the company constituted unlawful monopolization under the antitrust laws. following the entry of a verdict in lepages favor
and appellate rulings sustaining that verdict, direct and indirect tape
purchasers filed a number of purported class actions and individual actions
against the company in various state and federal courts. these cases alleged
that the company competed unfairly and unlawfully monopolized alleged markets
for transparent tape, and sought injunctive relief and damages in the form of
price overcharges the company allegedly charged for these products.
the company has resolved each of these actions. the settlements of the
various purported class actions received final court approval in 2006, and the
settlement of the single certified class action pending in the federal court in
pennsylvania received preliminary court approval in the fall of 2006 and is
scheduled for a final court approval hearing in the spring of 2007.
breast
implant litigation
the company and certain other companies were named as defendants in past
years in numerous claims and lawsuits alleging damages for personal injuries of
various types resulting from breast implants formerly manufactured by the
company or a related company. the vast majority of claims against the company
have been resolved. the company does not consider its remaining probable
liability to be material. information concerning the associated insurance
receivable and legal proceedings related to it follows in the paragraph
entitled breast implant insurance
receivables.
respirator
mask/asbestos litigation
for more than 25 years the company has defended and resolved the claims
of hundreds of thousands of individual claimants alleging injuries from
occupational dust exposures. as of december 31, 2006, the company is a named
defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts
that purport to represent approximately 17,700 individual claimants, a decrease
from the approximately 48,600 individual claimants with actions pending at
december 31, 2005.
the vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently
pending against the company allege use of some of the companys mask and
respirator products and seek damages from the company and other defendants for
alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal or
other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or
generally in the workplace. the remaining claimants generally allege personal
injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously
manufactured by the company, which are often unspecified, and by other
defendants, or occasionally at company premises.
in many of these lawsuits and claims, the company is named as a
defendant with multiple co-defendants where no product the company manufactured
is identified or where the company is ultimately determined not to have manufactured
the products identified by the plaintiffs. the companys vigorous defense of
this litigation has resulted in: (i) dismissals of many claims without any
payment by the company including more than 20,000 such dismissals in 2006
alone; (ii) an average settlement value of less than $1,000 per claimant for
all of the claims and lawsuits that the company has resolved, including those
dismissed without payment; and (iii) jury verdicts for the company in six of
the seven cases tried to verdict (such trials occurred in 1999, 2000, 2003 and
2004), and an appellate reversal in 2005 of the one jury verdict adverse to the
company.
many of the resolved lawsuits and claims involved unimpaired claimants
who were recruited by plaintiffs lawyers through mass chest x-ray screenings.
the company experienced a significant decline in the number of claims filed in
2006 from prior years by apparently unimpaired claimants. the company
attributes this decline to several factors, including certain changes enacted
in several states in recent years of the law governing asbestos-related claims,
and the highly-publicized decision in mid-2005 of the united states district
court for the southern district of texas that identified and criticized abuses
by certain attorneys, doctors and x-ray screening companies on behalf of
claimants. the company expects the filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in
the future to continue at much lower levels than in the past. the company
believes that due to this change in the type and volume of incoming claims, it
is likely that the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including
mesothelioma and other malignancies, while remaining relatively constant, will
represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. the company
has demonstrated in past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection
products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the
intended circumstances. consequently the company believes that claimants are
unable to establish that their medical condition, even if significant, is
attributable to the companys respiratory protection products. nonetheless the
companys litigation experience indicates that such claims are costlier to
resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore anticipates an
increase in the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a
per-claim basis than it experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of
claims were asserted by the unimpaired.
plaintiffs have asserted specific dollar claims for damages in
approximately 64% of the 6,108 lawsuits that were pending against the company
at the end of 2006 in all jurisdictions. a majority of states restrict or
prohibit specifying damages in tort cases such as these, and most of the
remaining jurisdictions do not require such specification. in those cases in
which
plaintiffs choose to assert specific dollar amounts in their complaints,
brought in states that permit such pleading, the amounts claimed are typically
not meaningful as an indicator of the companys potential liability. this is
because (a) the amounts claimed typically bear no relation to the extent of the
plaintiffs injury, if any; (b) the complaints nearly always assert claims
against multiple defendants with the typical complaint asserting claims against
as few as a dozen different defendants to upwards of 275 different defendants,
the damages alleged are not attributed to individual defendants, and a
defendants share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several
liability, which can vary by state, and by the amount of fault a jury allocates
to each defendant if a case is ultimately tried before a jury; (c) many cases
are filed against the company even though the plaintiffs did not use any of the
companys products and, ultimately, are withdrawn or dismissed without any
payment; and (d) many cases are brought on behalf of plaintiffs who have not
suffered any medical injury, and, ultimately, are resolved without any payment
or a payment that is a small fraction of the damages initially claimed. of the
3,917 pending cases in which purported damage amounts are specified in the
complaints, 2,207 cases involve claims of $100,000 or less (88 of them
also allege punitive damages of $10,000, 16 of them also allege punitive
damages of $15,000, and three of them also allege punitive damages of
$1,000,000); 168 cases involve claims above $100,000 up to $3 million (45 of
them also allege punitive damages of $250,000, 72 of them also allege punitive
damages of $350,000, one of them also alleges punitive damages of $1 million,
45 of them also allege punitive damages of $1.5 million, and one of them also
alleges punitive damages of $2 million); three cases involve claims above $3
million but less than $7.5 million (two also allege punitive damages of
$350,000 and one of them also alleges punitive damages of $5 million); 31 cases involve claims of $7.5
million; five cases involve claims above $7.5 million but less than $10 million
(four of them also allege punitive damages of $21 million); 1,473 cases involve
claims of $10 million (1,405 of them also allege punitive damages of $10
million, and one of them also alleges punitive damages of $15 million); 24
cases involved claims above $10 million but less than $50 million (two of them
also allege punitive damages of $350,000, two of them also allege punitive
damages of $15 million, five of them also allege punitive damages of $15.5
million, and four of them also allege punitive damages of $20 million); and six
cases involve claims of $50 million (five of them also allege punitive damages
of $50 million). some complaints allege that
the compensatory and punitive damages are at least the amounts specified. as
stated, the companys experience and the other reasons cited indicate that the
damage amounts specified in complaints are not a meaningful factor in any
assessment of the companys potential liability.
as previously reported, the state of west virginia, through its attorney
general, filed a complaint in 2003 against the company and two other manufacturers
of respiratory protection products in the circuit court of lincoln county, west
virginia and amended it in 2005. the amended complaint seeks substantial, but
unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs
allegedly incurred by the state for workers compensation and healthcare
benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis, including current or former
miners allegedly suffering from silicosis and/or coal miners pneumoconiosis (black
lung disease) and unspecified punitive damages.
employment litigation
as previously reported, one current and one former employee of the
company filed a purported class action in the district court of ramsey county,
minnesota in december 2004, seeking to represent a class of all current and
certain former salaried employees employed by 3m in minnesota below a certain
salary grade who were age 46 or older at any time during the applicable period
to be determined by the court. the complaint alleges the plaintiffs suffered
various forms of employment discrimination on the basis of age in violation of
the minnesota human rights act and seeks injunctive relief, unspecified
compensatory (up to triple actual damages) and punitive damages in excess of
$50,000, including back and front pay and attorneys fees. in january 2006, the
plaintiffs filed a motion to join four additional named plaintiffs. this motion
was unopposed by the company and the four plaintiffs were joined in the case,
although one claim has been dismissed following an individual settlement.
a similar age discrimination purported class action was filed against
the company in november 2005 in the superior court of essex county, new jersey
on behalf of a class of new jersey-based employees of the company. the company
removed this case to the united states district court for the district of new
jersey. in addition, three former employees filed age discrimination charges
against the company with the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission and
the pertinent state agencies in texas, minnesota and california, during 2005.
such filings include allegations that the release of claims signed by certain
former employees in the purported class defined in the charges is invalid for
various reasons. in 2006, one current employee filed an age discrimination
charge against the company with the u.s. equal employment opportunity
commission and the pertinent state agency in missouri, asserting claims on
behalf of a class of all current and certain former salaried employees who
worked in missouri and other states other than minnesota and new jersey. the
same law firm represents the plaintiffs and claimants in each of these
proceedings.
environmental
matters and litigation
the companys operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations
including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic
substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes
enforceable by national, state and local authorities around the world, and
private parties in the united states and abroad. these laws and regulations
provide, under certain circumstances, a basis for the remediation of
contamination and for personal injury and property damage claims. the company
has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in
complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and
property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its
environmental responsibilities. in its effort to satisfy its environmental
responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the
company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to
environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.
remediation: under certain environmental laws, including the united states
comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act of 1980
and similar state laws, the company may be jointly and severally liable,
typically with other companies, for the costs of environmental contamination at
current or former facilities and at off-site locations. the company has
identified numerous locations, most of which are in the united states, at which
it may have some liability. please refer to the following section, accrued
liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings for more
information on this subject.
regulatory activities: as previously reported, the company has been
voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, national
(primarily the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)), and international
agencies of possible environmental and health effects of perfluorooctanyl
compounds (perflurooctanoic acid or pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate or pfos)
and related compounds. as a result of its phase-out decision in may 2000, the
company no longer manufactures perfluorooctanyl compounds except that a
subsidiary recovers and recycles pfoa for internal use in production processes.
in january, 2006, the epa announced a
voluntary initiative under which eight companies, including the company and its
subsidiary referenced above, would commit to reduce emissions and product
content of pfoa by 95% by 2010 over levels in 2000, and to commit to working
toward the elimination of pfoa from emissions and products by 2015. the company
is well positioned to comply with these objectives in light of its phase out of
perfluorooctanyl chemistry in 2000. in october of 2006, the company submitted
its initial report under this voluntary initiative.
in january 2005, the epa issued a draft risk assessment for pfoa and
submitted it for review to the epa science advisory board. the epa document
expresses the epas preliminary assessment in terms of the margin of exposure
between the levels of that compound that cause adverse health effects in laboratory
animals and the levels found in human blood sera in the u.s. population.
a panel convened by the science advisory board issued a draft report in june
2005 and a revised draft in january 2006. the science advisory board has
conditionally approved the revised draft of the panel, which among other things
recommended that epa classify pfoa under the epas hazard descriptor of likely
to be carcinogenic to humans. the selection by the panel of this descriptor
was based upon the view that data from two studies show that pfoa is a
multisite carcinogen in rats. the company disagrees with this classification
since the panel did not consider other important data. the epa is expected to
make a final risk assessment based on its work to date and additional data not
considered by the science advisory board. in january 2006, the epa stated that
to date it is not aware of any studies specifically relating current levels of
pfoa exposure to human health effects.
the epa signed a memorandum of understanding with the company and dyneon
llc, a subsidiary of the company, in october, 2004, under which the company is
monitoring the potential presence of pfoa at and around the companys
manufacturing facility in decatur, alabama. activities are in progress pursuant
to this memorandum of understanding.
regulatory
activities concerning pfoa and/or pfos continue in europe and elsewhere, and
before certain international bodies. these activities include gathering of
exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory
approaches. on october 25, 2006, the european union parliament passed proposed
restrictions on the marketing and use of pfos. the directive will go into force when the ec formally adopts and
publishes the regulation. once published, member states will have 18 months to
enact the directive into national law. it is anticipated that the directive
will become effective mid-2008.
the company has been
cooperating with the process to review whether pfos meets the criteria under
the protocol for persistent organic pollutants (pops protocol). this protocol
is part of an international treaty known as the convention on long-range
transboundary air pollution (lrtap). in december of 2005, the executive body
comprised of parties to the protocol decided that the record generated under
the protocol review process was sufficient to determine that pfos qualifies as
a pop and that the review process should now proceed to a track b review
focused on the economic impacts and other aspects of adding pfos to the
protocol. the united states, which has signed but not yet ratified this
protocol, indicated its disagreement with the executive body decision. in
december of 2006, the executive body decided that the track b review should
continue and that further information is required before a decision on whether
to add pfos to the protocol should be made. pfos also has been nominated for
addition to another international treaty focused on pops known as the stockholm
convention. a process to prepare a risk profile for pfos is now proceeding
under that convention.
as previously reported, the company and state agencies tested
groundwater beneath three former waste disposal sites in washington county,
minnesota, used many years ago by the company to dispose lawfully of waste
containing perfluoronated compounds. the test results show that water from
certain municipal wells in oakdale, minnesota near two of the former disposal
sites and some private wells in that vicinity in lake elmo, minnesota contain
low levels of pfos and pfoa that, in some cases, are slightly above guidelines
established by the minnesota department of health (mdh).
the mdh is reevaluating these advisory health-based values (hbv) for
pfos/pfoa (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water considered by the
mdh staff to be safe for people to drink for a lifetime) and may lower them in
the future. additional testing by the mdh shows that water from the municipal
wells in oakdale, minnesota and some private wells in lake elmo, minnesota also
contain low levels of other perfluoronated compounds. the mdh currently plans
to apply the guidelines for pfos/pfoa for some of these compounds. as
previously reported, the company on its own initiative agreed with the city of
oakdale to construct, operate and maintain for at least five years a granular
activated carbon water treatment system to treat one or more of oakdales
municipal wells. the company also donated several acres of land to the city of
lake elmo, minnesota for a water tower and granted the city approximately $4
million that the city will use to expand municipal water service to
neighborhoods that include a small number of private wells in which levels of
pfos, pfoa and other perfluoronated compounds have been detected.
the mdh has also recently detected low levels of a perfluoronated
compound called perfluorobutanoic acid (pfba) in municipal wells in six nearby
communities (woodbury, cottage grove, newport, st. paul park, south st. paul,
and hastings, all communities located southeast of st. paul), some of which
slightly exceed the mdhs interim advisory level for pfba. the company is
working with the mdh and the minnesota pollution control agency (mpca) in
assessing the source of pfba in these municipal wells and is supplying data that
could be used in determining an appropriate guideline level. the mdh has not
issued any hbv for pfba and is temporarily applying guidelines it has developed
for pfoa. the company has advised the affected communities that it will assist
them in assuring their drinking water falls below the legally permissible level
for pfba when such value is finally determined.
the company is also working with the mpca to determine whether low
levels of pfoa, pfos and other perfluoronated compounds in the soil at the
companys former perfluoronated compound production facility at cottage grove,
minnesota, in the groundwater under the former plant and disposal sites, and in
river sediments near the former plant are continuing sources of such compounds
in the mississippi river, its fish and wildlife.
the company markets its newly reformulated scotchgard products (that replace the formulations from which
the company began its phase-out in 2000), pursuant to a consent agreement with
the epa that requires extensive health and environmental effects testing of the
base chemistry underlying such products, most of which has been completed. the
epa has not yet issued the anticipated hazard assessment of that health and
environmental effects testing for the reformulated scotchgard products.
the company cannot predict what regulatory actions arising from the
foregoing proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken regarding such
compounds or the consequences of any such actions.
litigation: as previously reported, a former employee filed a purported class
action lawsuit in 2002 in the circuit court of morgan county, alabama involving
perfluorooctanyl chemistry, alleging that the plaintiffs suffered fear,
increased risk, subclinical injuries and property damage from exposure to
perfluorooctanyl chemistry at or near the companys decatur, alabama,
manufacturing facility. the circuit court in 2005 granted the companys
motion to dismiss the named plaintiffs personal injury-related claims on the
basis that such claims are barred by the exclusivity provisions of the states
workers compensation act. the plaintiffs counsel filed an amended complaint in
november 2006, limiting the case to property damage claims on behalf of a
purported class of residents and property owners in the vicinity of the decatur
plant. also in 2005, the judge in a second
purported class action lawsuit (filed by three residents of morgan county,
alabama seeking unstated compensatory and punitive damages involving alleged
damage to their property from emissions of perfluorooctanyl compounds from the
companys decatur, alabama, manufacturing facility that formerly manufactured
those compounds) granted the companys motion to abate the case, effectively
putting the case on hold pending the resolution of class certification issues
in the action described above filed in the same court in 2002.
as previously reported, two residents of washington county, minnesota,
filed in october 2004 a purported class action in the district court of
washington county on behalf of washington county residents who have allegedly
suffered personal injuries and property damage from alleged emissions
from the former perfluorooctanyl production facility at cottage grove,
minnesota and from historic waste disposal sites in the vicinity of that
facility. after the district court
granted the companys motion to dismiss the claims for medical monitoring and
public nuisance in april 2005, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding
additional allegations involving other perfluoronated compounds manufactured by
the company, alleging additional legal theories in support of their claims,
adding four plaintiffs, and seeking relief based on alleged contamination of
the city of oakdale municipal water supply and certain private wells in the
vicinity of lake elmo, minnesota. in april 2006, the plaintiffs filed a second
amended complaint adding two additional plaintiffs. the two original plaintiffs
thereafter dismissed their claims against the company. plaintiffs counsel has
amended their definition of the purported class. the current (and fourth)
definition includes all individuals whose residential drinking water in
minnesota is or has been supplied by one or more wells containing one or more
carboxylated perfluorochemicals at a concentration exceeding 1.0 part per
billion, or containing one or more sulfonated perfluorochemicals at a
concentration exceeding 0.6 part per billion. pretrial proceedings are in
progress and the court has scheduled a hearing on plaintiffs motion to certify
the action as a class action for the spring of 2007.
several hundred plaintiffs who claim to have lived in the vicinity of
the acme barrel companys storage drum reconditioning facility in chicago,
illinois, filed a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2003 in the circuit court of
cook county, illinois, against 3m and a number of other companies that
allegedly were customers of acme barrel. the complaint seeks unspecified
damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by the plaintiffs exposure to
chemicals migrating from acme barrels drum reconditioning operations. the
plaintiffs also assert that a class should be certified on behalf of all
persons similarly situated. a separate wrongful death lawsuit was filed in the
circuit court of cook county, illinois, against 3m and a number of other
companies on behalf of the estate and family of a person who worked at the cook
county juvenile detention center in the vicinity of the acme barrel facility.
the lawsuit alleges unspecified damages from personal injuries and death
allegedly caused by exposure to chemicals migrating from acme barrels drum
reconditioning operations.
in the second quarter of 2006, the new jersey department of
environmental protection served a lawsuit that was filed in new jersey state
court against the company and several other companies seeking cleanup and
removal costs and damages to natural resources allegedly caused by the
discharge of hazardous substances from a former disposal site in new jersey.
the defendants removed the case to federal court.
accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal
proceedings
the company complies with the requirements of statement of financial
accounting standards no. 5, accounting for contingencies, and related
guidance, and records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where
it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability is
probable. where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the
company records the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the
range if there is no one best estimate. the company either discloses the amount
of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established reserves if
estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. for those insured
matters where the company has taken a reserve, the company also records
receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the
companys insurance program. for those insured matters where the company has
not taken a reserve because the liability is not probable or the amount of the
liability is not estimable, or both, but where the company has incurred an
expense in defending itself, the company records receivables for the amount of
insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred. the company
discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or
the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the company believes
there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.
because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable
rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that the company
may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. a
future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in
future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the companys
results of operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded.
the company currently believes that such future charges, if any, would not have
a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the
company, taking into account its significant available insurance coverage.
based on experience and developments, the company periodically reexamines its
estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables, and
whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not
estimable and/or not probable. where appropriate, the company makes additions
to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. as a result, the current estimates
of the potential impact on the companys consolidated financial position,
results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims
pending against the company could change in the future.
the company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its
numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law interpreting
comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the
nature of the claim, and records an amount it has concluded is likely to be
recovered.
the following table shows the major categories of on-going litigation,
environmental remediation and other liabilities (as defined below) for which
the company has been able to estimate its probable liability and for which the
company has taken reserves and the related insurance receivables:

other liabilities
the company recorded $40
million in the second quarter of 2006 with respect to the settlement in
principle reached in that quarter with respect to the antitrust class action
brought on behalf of direct purchasers who did not purchase private label tape.
for those significant pending legal proceedings that do not appear in the table
and that are not the subject of pending settlement agreements, the company has
determined that liability is not probable or
the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, and the company is
unable to estimate the possible loss
or range of loss at this time. the amounts in the preceding table with respect
to breast implant and environmental remediation represent the companys best
estimate of the respective liabilities. the company does not believe that there
is any single best estimate of the respirator/mask/asbestos liability or the
other liabilities shown above, nor that it can reliably estimate the amount or
range of amounts by which those liabilities may exceed the reserves the company
has established.
breast implant insurance receivables: as of
december 31, 2006, the company had receivables for insurance recoveries related
to the breast implant matter of $93 million, representing amounts expected to
be recovered pursuant to the minnesota supreme courts ruling of august 2003
but yet to be received and other amounts that have been claimed from various
reinsurers, the minnesota insurance guaranty association, and the estates of certain insolvent insurance carriers.
the company received about $1 million in the fourth quarter of 2006 (bringing
total recoveries in 2006 to $43 million), pursuant to settlements that were
consistent with the companys overall expectation of recovery as a result of
the minnesota supreme court ruling. this recovery reduced the previously
recorded receivable, which was separately raised in the fourth quarter by $6
million reflecting a revised estimate of likely total remaining recoveries.
with these recent settlements and the previously disclosed settlements, 21 of
the 29 insurers have withdrawn from the pending proceedings and have settled
the companys claims under the minnesota supreme court decision. various
factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of the balance of the
companys insurance receivables, including (i) additional delays in or
avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become
insolvent in the future, and (iii) the outcome of the pending legal proceedings
involving the insurers. the company expects the district court in ramsey county
minnesota will enter in the first quarter of 2007 a comprehensive order and
judgment setting forth the amount (plus interest) that each of the insurers
remaining in the case owe the company.
respirator
mask/asbestos liabilities and insurance receivables: the
company estimates its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, including the cost
to resolve the claim and defense costs, by examining: (i) the companys
experience in resolving claims, (ii) apparent trends, (iii) the apparent
quality of claims (e.g., whether
the claim has been asserted on behalf of
asymptomatic claimants), (iv) changes in the nature and mix of claims (e.g., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the
companys mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of
asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of
asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the company), (v) the
number of current claims and a projection of the number of future asbestos and
other claims that may be filed against the company, (vi) the cost to resolve
recently settled claims, and (vii) an estimate of the cost to resolve and
defend against current and future claims. because of the inherent difficulty in
projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, particularly
with respect to the companys respiratory products that themselves did not
contain any harmful materials (which makes the various published studies that
purport to project future asbestos claims substantially removed from the
companys principal experience and which themselves vary widely), the company
does not believe that there is any single best estimate of this liability, nor
that it can reliably estimate the amount or range of amounts by which the
liability may exceed the reserve the company has established. no liability has been recorded regarding the
pending action brought by the west virginia attorney general previously
described.
developments
may occur that could affect the companys estimate of its liabilities. these
developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes in (i) the
number of future claims, (ii) the average cost of resolving claims, (iii) the
legal costs of defending these claims and in maintaining trial readiness, (iv)
changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v) trial and appellate
outcomes, (vi) changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, and
(vii) the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.
as of december 31, 2006, the companys receivable for insurance
recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $380 million.
the company collected $17 million in the fourth quarter and $75 million in 2006
from several of its insurers, reducing this receivable by that amount. while
the company has substantial remaining claims-made and occurrence (pre-1986)
insurance coverage, as previously disclosed this additional receivable
represents a lower percentage of the additional liability than was the case
with receivables recorded prior to 2004 primarily because of varying degrees of
prior settlements with the companys insurers, insolvencies of certain
insurers, uncertainties concerning the precise manner of assigning particular
costs to specific policies, potential exhaustion of policies, and the types of
claims asserted. various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery
of this receivable, including (i) delays in or avoidance of payment by
insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future,
and (iii) the outcome of negotiations with insurers and possible legal
proceedings, if necessary, with respect to respirator mask/asbestos liability
insurance coverage. on january 5, 2007 the company was served with a
declaratory judgment action filed on behalf of two of its insurers (continental
casualty and continental insurance co.) disclaiming coverage for
respirator/mask claims. the action was filed in hennepin county,
minnesota and names, in addition to the company, over 60 of the companys
insurers. this action is similar in nature to an action filed in 1994 with
respect to breast implant coverage, which ultimately resulted in the minnesota
supreme courts ruling of 2003 that was largely in the companys favor.
the difference between the accrued liability and insurance receivable
represents in part the time delay between payment of claims and recording of
liability (including with respect to projected future claims) on the one hand
and receipt of insurance reimbursements on the other hand. because of the lag time
between settlement and payment of a claim, no meaningful conclusions may be
drawn from quarterly changes in the amount of receivables for expected
insurance recoveries and the quarterly changes in the number of claimants at
the end of each quarter.
environmental and other liabilities and insurance
receivables: as of december 31, 2006, the company had
recorded liabilities of $44 million for estimated environmental remediation
costs based upon an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to
each individual site and also recorded related insurance receivables of $15
million. the company increased its reserves by $13 million during the fourth
quarter of 2006 for estimated environmental remediation costs at one of its
european pharmaceutical plants. the company records liabilities for remediation
costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable,
generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the companys
commitment to a plan of action. liabilities for estimated costs of
environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon
internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number,
participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible
parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial
actions. the company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information
develops or circumstances change. the company expects that it will pay the
amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites,
currently ranging up to 30 years. the amounts in the above table described as other
liabilities include the estimated costs of fulfilling the previously disclosed
agreements with the city of oakdale and lake elmo, minnesota, in addressing
perfluoronated compounds in drinking water sources in those communities and in
addressing perfluoronated compounds in the soil at the companys manufacturing
facilities in decatur, alabama and cottage grove, minnesota that formerly
manufactured those compounds.
it is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and
remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and
enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of
environmental contamination and the existence of alternate cleanup methods.
developments may occur that could affect the companys current assessment,
including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information available
regarding the environmental impact of the companys operations and products;
(ii) changes in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of
specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement
theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages;
(iii) new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in
allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the
financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party
indemnitors.
contractual
obligations:
during the third
quarter of 2006, the company entered into an unconditional agreement to
purchase raw materials from a third-party supplier. the agreement, effective
from january 1, 2007 to december 31, 2009, requires 3m to purchase approximately
$200 million of raw materials. the purchase obligation amounts do not represent
the entire anticipated purchases by 3m during the contract period, but
represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated.
note 14. employee savings and stock
ownership plans
the
company sponsors employee savings plans under section 401(k) of the internal
revenue code. these plans are offered to substantially all regular u.s.
employees. employee contributions of up to 6% of compensation are matched at
rates ranging from 35% to 50%, with additional company contributions depending
upon company performance. all company contributions initially are invested in
3m common stock, with employee contributions invested in a number of investment
funds pursuant to their elections. vested employees may diversify their 3m
shares into other investment options.
the
company maintains an employee stock ownership plan (esop). this plan was
established in 1989 as a cost-effective way of funding the majority of the companys
contributions under 401(k) employee savings plans. total esop shares are
considered to be shares outstanding for earnings per share calculations.
dividends
on shares held by the esop are paid to the esop trust and, together with
company contributions, are used by the esop to repay principal and interest on
the outstanding esop debt. the tax benefit related to dividends paid on
unallocated shares was charged directly to equity and totaled approximately $3
million in 2006, $4 million in 2005, and $4million in 2004. over the life
of the esop debt, shares are released for allocation to participants based on
the ratio of the current years debt service to the remaining debt service
prior to the current payment.
the esop has been the
primary funding source for the companys employee savings plans. as permitted
by aicpa statement of position 93-6, employers accounting for employee stock
ownership plans, the company has elected to continue its practices, which are
based on statement of position 76-3, accounting practices for certain employee
stock ownership plans and subsequent consensus of the eitf of the fasb.
accordingly, the debt of the esop is recorded as debt, and shares pledged as
collateral are reported as unearned compensation in the consolidated balance
sheet and consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity and
comprehensive income. unearned compensation is reduced symmetrically as the
esop makes principal payments on the debt. expenses related to the esop include
total debt service on the notes, less dividends. the company contributes
treasury shares, accounted for at fair value, to employee savings plans to
cover obligations not funded by the esop (reported as an employee benefit
expense).

companys gespp. substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the
plan. participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of
grant. there are no gespp shares under option at the beginning or end of each

note
16. management stock ownership program
(msop)
in
may 2005, shareholders approved 36.75 million shares for issuance under the
msop in the form of management stock options, restricted stock, restricted
stock units and stock appreciation rights. under the plan, the company has
principally issued management stock options that are granted at market value on
the date of grant. prior to 2005, under previous plans, these options were
generally exercisable one year after the date of grant, with expiration 10 years
from the date of grant. effective with the may 2005 grant, the company changed
its vesting period from one to three years with the expiration date remaining
at 10 years from date of grant. outstanding shares under option include grants
from previous plans. there were approximately 14,800 participants in the plan
with outstanding options at december 31, 2006.

for options outstanding
at december 31, 2006, the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 69
months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $1.075 billion. for options
exercisable at december 31, 2006, the weighted-average remaining contractual
life was 58 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $1.065 billion. as of
december 31, 2006, there was $212 million of compensation expense that has yet
to be recognized related to non-vested stock-based awards that is expected to
be recognized over a weighted-average period of 1.93 years. the total intrinsic
values of stock options exercised during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, was
$289 million, $278 million and $339 million. cash received from options
exercised during 2006, 2005 and 2004, respectively, was $414 million, $437
million and $389 million.
effective with the may
2005 grant, the company no longer issues options eligible for additional progressive
(reload) options; however, when a progressive option is issued upon the
exercise of a pre-may 2005 non-qualified stock option, the option is revalued
and additional stock compensation expense is incurred. refer to note 1 for the
impact of stock-based compensation on net income and earnings per share.

in connection with the
adoption of sfas no. 123r, in 2005 the company reviewed and updated, among
other things, its volatility and expected term assumptions. expected volatility
is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to
fluctuate during a period. for the 2006 and 2005 annual grant date, the company
estimated the expected volatility based upon the average of the most recent one
year volatility, the median of the term of the expected life rolling
volatility, the median of the most recent term of the expected life volatility
of 3m stock, and the implied volatility on the grant date. the expected term
assumption is based on the weighted average of historical grants and assuming
that options outstanding are exercised at the midpoint of the future remaining
term.
note 17.
business segments
3ms businesses are
organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in
products, technologies and services. 3m
manages its operations in six operating business segments: industrial and
transportation segment, health care segment, display and graphics segment,
consumer and office segment, safety, security and protection services segment
and electro and communications segment. 3ms six business segments bring
together common or related 3m technologies, enhancing the development of
innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of
business resources. these segments have worldwide responsibility for virtually
all 3m product lines. 3m is not dependent on any single product or
market. certain small businesses and
staff-sponsored products, as well as various corporate assets and expenses, are
not allocated to the business segments.
transactions among
reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3m is an integrated enterprise
characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and
inventory transfers. therefore, management does not represent that these
segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income and
other financial information shown. the allocations resulting from the shared
utilization of assets are not necessarily indicative of the underlying activity
for segment assets, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.

segment assets for the operating business segments (excluding corporate
and unallocated) primarily include accounts receivable; inventory; property,
plant and equipment  net;
goodwill and intangible assets; and other miscellaneous assets. assets included
in corporate and unallocated principally are cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities; insurance receivables; deferred income taxes; certain
investments and other assets, including prepaid pension assets; and certain
unallocated property, plant and equipment. corporate and unallocated assets
decreased approximately $0.9 billion in 2006, primarily due to decreases in
prepaid pension and postretirement benefits, partially offset by increases in
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. corporate and unallocated
assets decreased approximately $1.7 billion in 2005, primarily due to decreases
in cash and cash equivalents. for management reporting purposes, corporate
goodwill (which at december 31, 2006, totaled approximately $320million)
is not allocated to the six operating business segments. in note 3, corporate
goodwill has been allocated to the respective market segments as required by
sfas no. 142 for impairment testing.
corporate and unallocated operating income principally includes
corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses,
insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation expenses, corporate
restructuring program charges and other miscellaneous items. because this
category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to
fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
refer to note 2 and note 4 for discussion of items that significantly
impact business segment reported results. the most significant items impacting
2006 results are the net gain on sale of portions of the pharmaceuticals
business (within the health care segment) and restructuring and other actions.

includes japan net sales to customers of $2.048 billion in 2006, $2.094 billion
in 2005, and $2.077billion in 2004. asia pacific includes japan net
property, plant and equipment of $345 million in 2006, $350million in

quarter of 2006. 2006 included net
benefits from gains related to the sale of certain portions of 3ms
