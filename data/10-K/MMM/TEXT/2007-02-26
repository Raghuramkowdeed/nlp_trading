JOBBERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS IN 3M AND ITS PRODUCTS



A CONFIDENCE DEVELOPED THROUGH LONG ASSOCIATION



HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO 3MS POSITION IN

THE MARKETPLACE AND TO ITS GROWTH. 3M HAS 169 SALES OFFICES WORLDWIDE, WITH 10

RESEARCH AND PATENTS

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CONSTITUTES AN IMPORTANT PART OF 3MS

ACTIVITIES AND HAS BEEN A MAJOR DRIVER OF 3MS SALES GROWTH. RESEARCH,

DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES TOTALED $1.522 BILLION IN 2006. THIS AMOUNT

INCLUDED A $95 MILLION IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGE (DISCUSSED IN

NOTE 2) AND $75 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS (NOTE 4). RESEARCH,

DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES TOTALED $1.274 BILLION IN 2005 AND $1.246

BILLION IN 2004. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, COVERING BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

AND THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES TOTALED $818 MILLION IN 2005 AND $792 MILLION

IN 2004. RELATED EXPENSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT PROVIDED BY 3M TO

EXISTING CUSTOMERS WHO ARE USING 3M PRODUCTS, AND THE COSTS OF INTERNALLY

DEVELOPED PATENTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AROUND THE WORLD UNDER VARIOUS

TRADEMARKS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ALSO OWNS, OR HOLDS

LICENSES TO USE, NUMEROUS U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS. THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES GENERATE A STEADY STREAM OF INVENTIONS THAT ARE COVERED

BY NEW PATENTS. PATENTS APPLICABLE TO SPECIFIC PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR VARYING

PERIODS ACCORDING TO THE DATE OF PATENT APPLICATION FILING OR PATENT GRANT AND

THE LEGAL TERM OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION IS

OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY A PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY FROM

COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE

AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN THE COUNTRY.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS PATENTS PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE IN MANY OF ITS BUSINESSES. IN GENERAL, NO SINGLE PATENT OR GROUP OF

RELATED PATENTS IS IN ITSELF ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE OR TO ANY OF

THE COMPANYS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE IMPORTANCE OF PATENTS IN THE DISPLAY AND

GRAPHICS SEGMENTS IS DESCRIBED IN PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT  DISPLAY

AND GRAPHICS BUSINESS IN PART II, ITEM 7, OF THIS FORM 10-K.

RAW MATERIALS

IN 2006, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED PRICE INCREASES

AFFECTING METALS, WOOD PULP AND OIL-DERIVED RAW MATERIALS. DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2006 TOTAL MARKET DEMAND FOR METALS AND OIL-DERIVED RAW MATERIALS

BEGAN TO SOFTEN AND THE COMPANY IS THEREFORE PURSUING PRICE REDUCTIONS FOR

THOSE COMMODITIES. TO DATE THE COMPANY IS RECEIVING SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF

ALL RAW MATERIALS TO MEET ITS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS.

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT FUTURE SHORTAGES OF RAW MATERIALS OR THE IMPACT ANY

SUCH SHORTAGES WOULD HAVE. 3M HAS AVOIDED DISRUPTION TO ITS MANUFACTURING

OPERATIONS THROUGH CAREFUL MANAGEMENT OF EXISTING RAW MATERIAL INVENTORIES AND

DEVELOPMENT AND

5

QUALIFICATION OF ADDITIONAL SUPPLY SOURCES. 3M MANAGES

COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION

AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

3MS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY

NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AROUND THE WORLD. 3M HAS MADE, AND

PLANS TO CONTINUE MAKING, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE

LAWS. 3M IS ALSO INVOLVED IN REMEDIATION ACTIONS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS FROM PAST OPERATIONS AT CERTAIN SITES (REFER TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND

OTHER LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES IN NOTE 13, COMMITMENTS AND

CONTINGENCIES).

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXISTING

CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR

FUTURE REVENUES ARE EXPENSED. RESERVES FOR LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED

REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE

AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY

STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION. ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE

OPERATIONS GENERALLY ARE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES.

IN 2006, 3M EXPENDED ABOUT $18 MILLION FOR CAPITAL

PROJECTS RELATED TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPARABLE AMOUNT IN 2005

WAS ABOUT $28 MILLION. THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION

ACTIONS RELATING TO EXISTING MATTERS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS. CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES HAVE INCLUDED POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICES

 SUCH AS WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT IMPROVEMENTS, SCRUBBERS, CONTAINMENT

STRUCTURES, SOLVENT RECOVERY UNITS AND THERMAL OXIDIZERS  AT NEW AND EXISTING

FACILITIES CONSTRUCTED OR UPGRADED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. CONSISTENT

WITH THE COMPANYS POLICIES STRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY, CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES (OTHER THAN FOR REMEDIATION PROJECTS) FOR KNOWN PROJECTS ARE

PRESENTLY EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $20 MILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS FOR NEW

OR EXPANDED PROGRAMS TO BUILD FACILITIES OR MODIFY MANUFACTURING PROCESSES TO

MINIMIZE WASTE AND REDUCE EMISSIONS.

WHILE THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE

FUTURE COSTS OF SUCH CLEANUP ACTIVITIES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING

COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

* RESULTS ARE IMPACTED BY THE EFFECTS OF, AND CHANGES IN, WORLDWIDE

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY OPERATES IN MORE THAN 60 COUNTRIES AND DERIVES MORE THAN 60% OF ITS

REVENUES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED

BY FACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE BEYOND ITS

CONTROL, SUCH AS DOWNTURNS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR

REGION, OR IN THE VARIOUS INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES; SOCIAL,

POLITICAL OR LABOR CONDITIONS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION; OR ADVERSE

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, TAX, OR REGULATIONS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH

THE COMPANY OPERATES.

* THE

COMPANYS RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMER

PREFERENCES

. DEMAND

FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, WHICH IMPACTS REVENUE AND PROFIT MARGINS, IS

AFFECTED BY (I) THE DEVELOPMENT AND TIMING OF THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITIVE

PRODUCTS; (II) THE COMPANYS RESPONSE TO DOWNWARD PRICING TO STAY COMPETITIVE;

(III) CHANGES IN CUSTOMER ORDER PATTERNS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF INVENTORY

MAINTAINED BY CUSTOMERS AND THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER PURCHASES WHICH MAY BE

AFFECTED BY ANNOUNCED PRICE CHANGES, CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS INCENTIVE

PROGRAMS, OR THE CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE INCENTIVE GOALS; AND (IV)

CHANGES IN CUSTOMERS PREFERENCES FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE SUCCESS OF

PRODUCTS OFFERED BY OUR COMPETITORS, AND CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DESIGNS FOR THEIR

PRODUCTS THAT CAN AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR SOME OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

* FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THOSE RATES MAY

AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO REALIZE PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN ITS SALES AND

EARNINGS.

BECAUSE THE

COMPANY DERIVES MORE THAN 60% OF ITS REVENUES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES,

ITS ABILITY TO REALIZE PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN SALES AND EARNINGS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS SIGNIFICANTLY AGAINST FOREIGN

CURRENCIES.

* THE COMPANYS GROWTH OBJECTIVES ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TIMING

AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF ITS NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING

ITS

ABILITY TO RENEW ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS TO

MARKET.

THIS ABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DIFFICULTIES OR

DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW

PRODUCTS, OBTAIN ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION, OR GAIN MARKET

ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT NEW PRODUCTS WILL

PROVE TO BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL.

* THE COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COSTS

AND AVAILABILITY OF PURCHASED COMPONENTS, COMPOUNDS, RAW MATERIALS

AND ENERGY,

INCLUDING

OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES,

DUE TO

SHORTAGES, INCREASED DEMAND, SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS,

NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER FACTORS

. THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON VARIOUS

COMPONENTS, COMPOUNDS, RAW MATERIALS, AND ENERGY (INCLUDING OIL AND NATURAL GAS

AND THEIR DERIVATIVES) SUPPLIED BY OTHERS FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF ITS PRODUCTS

AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ANY OF ITS SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS COULD BE INTERRUPTED

DUE TO NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS AND OTHER EVENTS OR BE TERMINATED IN THE

FUTURE. ANY SUSTAINED INTERRUPTION IN THE COMPANYS RECEIPT OF ADEQUATE

SUPPLIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION,

WHILE THE COMPANY HAS A PROCESS TO MINIMIZE VOLATILITY IN COMPONENT AND MATERIAL

PRICING, NO ASSURANCE CAN

8

BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE PRICE

FLUCTUATIONS OR THAT FUTURE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS OR SHORTAGES WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

*

ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER

UNUSUAL EVENTS RESULTING FROM PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AND OTHER EVOLVING

BUSINESS STRATEGIES, AND POSSIBLE ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING COULD AFFECT

FUTURE RESULTS

. THE COMPANY

MONITORS ITS BUSINESS PORTFOLIO AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND HAS MADE AND

MAY CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, DIVESTITURES AND

CHANGES TO ITS ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE. WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, FUTURE

RESULTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO INTEGRATE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES

QUICKLY AND OBTAIN THE ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES.

*

THE COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS MAY

BE AFFECTED IF THE COMPANY GENERATES LESS PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS THAN

ESTIMATED

. THE COMPANY UTILIZES VARIOUS TOOLS, SUCH AS LEAN SIX

SIGMA, TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT ALL OF THE PROJECTED PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE REALIZED.

*

THE COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS MAY

BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING THOSE

INVOLVING PRODUCT LIABILITY, ANTITRUST, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHER MATTERS.

THE OUTCOME OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY DIFFER FROM THE COMPANYS

EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE THE OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION, INCLUDING REGULATORY MATTERS,

ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO RELIABLY PREDICT. VARIOUS FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN

LEAD THE COMPANY TO CHANGE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES AND RELATED

INSURANCE RECEIVABLES WHERE APPLICABLE, OR MAKE SUCH ESTIMATES FOR MATTERS

PREVIOUSLY NOT SUSCEPTIBLE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES, SUCH AS A SIGNIFICANT

JUDICIAL RULING OR JUDGMENT, A SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT, SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY

DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A FUTURE ADVERSE RULING, SETTLEMENT

OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN

ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

INVOLVING THE COMPANY AND THE ASSOCIATED ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, SEE THE

DISCUSSION IN NOTE 13.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004) AND USED THE MODIFIED

RETROSPECTIVE METHOD TO ADJUST ALL PRIOR PERIODS TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE

FAIR-VALUE BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK OPTIONS. REFER TO NOTE 1 FOR

MORE DETAIL ON THESE TWO ITEMS.

2006 RESULTS INCLUDED NET GAINS THAT INCREASED OPERATING INCOME BY $523

MILLION AND NET INCOME BY $438 MILLION.

2006 INCLUDED NET BENEFITS FROM

GAINS RELATED TO THE SALE OF

CERTAIN PORTIONS OF 3MS BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS ($1.074 BILLION

PRE-TAX, $674 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AND FAVORABLE

INCOME TAX ADJUSTMENTS ($149 MILLION), WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ($403 MILLION PRE-TAX, $257 MILLION AFTER-TAX), ACQUIRED

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ($95 MILLION PRE-TAX AND

AFTER-TAX), SETTLEMENT COSTS OF A PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED ANTITRUST CLASS ACTION

($40 MILLION PRE-TAX, $25 MILLION AFTER-TAX), AND ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS

RELATED TO THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS ($13 MILLION PRE-TAX, $8 MILLION

AFTER-TAX). 2005 RESULTS INCLUDED CHARGES THAT REDUCED NET INCOME BY $75

MILLION. THIS RELATED TO A TAX LIABILITY RESULTING FROM 3MS REINVESTMENT OF

APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS IN THE UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO

THE REPATRIATION PROVISIONS OF THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004. 2003

RESULTS INCLUDED CHARGES

RELATED TO AN ADVERSE RULING IN A LAWSUIT FILED

AGAINST 3M IN 1997 BY LEPAGES INC.

THAT

REDUCED OPERATING INCOME BY $93 MILLION ($58 MILLION AFTER TAX). 2002

CHARGES IN CONNECTION WITH 3MS 2001/2002 RESTRUCTURING PLAN REDUCED OPERATING

INCOME BY $202 MILLION ($108 MILLION AFTER TAX AND MINORITY INTEREST).

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION

AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

3M

IS A DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL MANUFACTURER, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATOR AND MARKETER OF A

WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS. 3M MANAGES ITS OPERATIONS IN SIX OPERATING BUSINESS

SEGMENTS: INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION; HEALTH CARE; DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS;

CONSUMER AND OFFICE; SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; AND ELECTRO AND

COMMUNICATIONS.

3MS STRATEGY EMPHASIZES

A COMMITMENT TO GROW AT A FASTER PACE, USING A FOUR-PRONGED APPROACH, WHICH

INCLUDES REINVESTING IN ITS CORE BUSINESSES, DEVELOPING ADJACENT EMERGING

BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, EXPANDING ON THE COMPANYS ALREADY WORLD-CLASS

CAPABILITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, AND ACQUIRING COMPANIES IN

FASTER-GROWING INDUSTRIES.

·

3MS

REINVESTMENT IN THE CORE IS EVIDENCED THROUGH ITS 2006 INVESTMENTS IN NEW

PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN A NUMBER OF GROWING AND HIGHLY PROFITABLE BUSINESSES,

SUCH AS MEDICAL, RESPIRATORY PROTECTION, LCD FILMS AND OTHERS. IN ADDITION, 3M

IS INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WHICH SHOULD POSITION OUR EXISTING

BUSINESS PORTFOLIO FOR ACCELERATED GROWTH.

·

3M LAUNCHED FIVE

NEW EMERGING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, INCLUDING OUR TRACK AND TRACE INITIATIVE,

GLOBAL MINING, FOOD SAFETY, FILTRATION, AND ENERGY. 3M MADE GREAT PROGRESS ON

ITS TRACK AND TRACE INITIATIVE IN 2006, MERGING A NUMBER OF FORMERLY DISPARATE

EFFORTS INTO ONE SINGLE GROWTH ENGINE FOR THE FUTURE. TRACK AND TRACE HAS A

GROWING ARRAY OF APPLICATIONS  FROM TRACKING PACKAGES TO MANAGING MEDICAL AND

LEGAL RECORDS.

·

3M

CONTINUED TO BUILD ITS CAPABILITIES IN MANY OF THE WORLDS FASTEST-GROWING

EMERGING ECONOMIES IN 2006. 3M BEGAN CONSTRUCTION OF THREE NEW PLANTS IN CHINA,

ONE IN RUSSIA, ONE IN POLAND AND ONE IN INDIA. BY THE END OF 2007, 3M EXPECTS

TO HAVE 10 OR MORE PLANTS OPEN OR UNDER CONSTRUCTION IN CHINA. 3M ALSO DROVE

OUTSTANDING GROWTH IN MORE DEVELOPED COUNTRIES. EUROPEAN SALES GROWTH WAS ABOUT

10% IN U.S. DOLLARS, AND 8.3% IN LOCAL CURRENCIES.

11

·

3M

CLOSED ON 19 ACQUISITIONS IN 2006, ALL CONTRIBUTING TO GROWTH IN DIFFERENT

WAYS. ACQUISITIONS WERE MADE TO ADD PRODUCTS AND GAP-FILLERS, TO EXPAND OUR

OFFERINGS AND BECOME MORE IMPORTANT TO OUR CUSTOMERS, TO ADD CAPACITY, TO GET ACCESS

TO LOCAL MARKETS VIA LOCAL BRANDS, AND TO AUGMENT OUR EXISTING TECHNOLOGY BASE.

WITH A CONTINUED

FOCUS ON THESE STRATEGIES INTO 2007, 3M BELIEVES IT CAN TRANSFORM ITSELF INTO A

FASTER-GROWING COMPANY.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO

INCREASE BOTH RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (EXCLUDING THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS,

ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGE AND RESTRUCTURING-RELATED

ITEMS) AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2007, WITH INVESTMENTS IN GROWTH PROGRAMS

AROUND THE WORLD. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES TOTALED $1.522

BILLION IN 2006. THIS INCLUDED A $95 MILLION IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT CHARGE (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2) AND APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION IN

RESTRUCTURING-RELATED ITEMS (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4). ADJUSTED FOR THESE ITEMS,

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES STILL INCREASED BY OVER 6%. TOTAL

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR 2006 TOTALED $1.168 BILLION, UP $225 MILLION COMPARED

WITH 2005. THE COMPANY EXPECTS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $1.4

BILLION TO $1.5 BILLION IN 2007, PROVIDING THE CAPACITY TO MEET EXPECTED

GROWTH.

3M ANNOUNCED IN APRIL 2006 THAT IT WOULD EXPLORE STRATEGIC ALTERNATIVES

FOR ITS GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS. 3M BELIEVES THAT IN TODAYS

VERY COMPETITIVE PHARMACEUTICALS MARKETPLACE, CONTINUED SUCCESS IN BRAND

PHARMACEUTICALS REQUIRES BROAD PIPELINES OF NEW DRUGS, SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS,

AND A LONGER-TERM RISK-REWARD MODEL THAN APPLIES TO MOST OTHER 3M BUSINESSES.

IN DECEMBER 2006 AND JANUARY 2007, 3M COMPLETED THE SALE OF ITS BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2, THE JANUARY 2007 TRANSACTION WILL BE RECORDED

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007. AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED, 3M HAD INDICATED THAT IT

WOULD LIKELY INCUR SOME RESTRUCTURING-RELATED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SELLING THE

BUSINESS.

AS A

RESULT OF THE ABOVE, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, 3M RECORDED A GAIN ON SALE,

WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS. INCLUDING THESE

ITEMS, I

N 2006,

3M REPORTED RECORD

NET SALES OF $22.923 BILLION AND RECORD NET INCOME OF $3.851 BILLION, OR $5.06

PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED WITH NET SALES OF $21.167 BILLION AND NET INCOME OF

$3.111 BILLION, OR $3.98 PER DILUTED SHARE. EXCLUDING THESE ITEMS, THE COMPANY

STILL ACHIEVED STRONG UNDERLYING OPERATING PERFORMANCE, HELPED BY THE COMBINATION

OF AN 8.3% INCREASE IN NET SALES, INCLUDING CORE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH OF

5.6%

(WHICH EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN THE LAST 12

MONTHS).

IN

2006, THE GAIN ON SALE, NET OF RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS, INCREASED

OPERATING INCOME BY $523 MILLION AND NET INCOME BY $438 MILLION, OR $0.57 PER

DILUTED SHARE.

2006 INCLUDED NET

BENEFITS FROM

GAINS RELATED TO THE SALE OF CERTAIN PORTIONS OF 3MS

BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS ($1.074 BILLION PRE-TAX, $674 MILLION

AFTER-TAX) AND FAVORABLE

INCOME TAX

ADJUSTMENTS ($149 MILLION), WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY RESTRUCTURING

ACTIONS ($403 MILLION PRE-TAX, $257 MILLION AFTER-TAX), ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ($95 MILLION PRE-TAX AND AFTER-TAX),

SETTLEMENT COSTS OF A PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED ANTITRUST CLASS ACTION ($40 MILLION

PRE-TAX, $25 MILLION AFTER-TAX), AND ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THE

PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS ($13 MILLION PRE-TAX, $8 MILLION AFTER-TAX). THESE

ITEMS ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 2 (ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES),

NOTE 4 (2006 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS), NOTE 8 (INCOME TAXES), AND NOTE 13

(COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES).

IN 2005,

3M ADOPTED

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD INTERPRETATION (FASB) NO. 47, ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS,

AND REPATRIATED

APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TO THE UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO

THE PROVISIONS OF THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (REFER TO NOTE 1 AND

NOTE 8 FOR MORE DETAIL).

COMBINED,

THESE TWO ITEMS REDUCED NET INCOME BY $110 MILLION IN 2005.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE CONTAINS SALES AND OPERATING INCOME RESULTS BY

BUSINESS SEGMENT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005. REFER TO

THE PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT SECTION FOR DISCUSSION OF THE NET IMPACT OF

THE GAIN ON SALE, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS THAT INCREASED HEALTH CARE

3MS

SALES PERFORMANCE IN 2006 WAS BROAD-BASED, WITH ALL SIX BUSINESS SEGMENTS

CONTRIBUTING TO POSITIVE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH. SALES GROWTH IN

THE INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION

SEGMENT WAS

LED BY INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES AND TAPES, ALONG WITH THE AUTOMOTIVE

AFTERMARKET BUSINESS. ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY CUNO, ADDED 4.6% TO INDUSTRIAL

AND TRANSPORTATION SALES GROWTH. SALES GROWTH IN HEALTH CARE WAS LED BY 3MS

CORE MEDICAL AND DENTAL BUSINESSES.

DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SALES GROWTH

WAS LED BY

DISPLAY ENHANCEMENT FILMS USED

IN FLAT-PANEL DEVICES AND STRONG GROWTH IN THE COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS BUSINESS.

SALES GROWTH IN THE CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENT WAS BROAD-BASED ACROSS THE MANY

CHANNELS 3M SERVES, MOST NOTABLY IN THE MASS-MARKET CONSUMER AND HOME

IMPROVEMENT RETAIL CHANNELS. SALES GROWTH IN THE SAFETY, SECURITY AND

PROTECTION SERVICES SEGMENT WAS DRIVEN BY CONTINUED STRONG DEMAND FOR PERSONAL

PROTECTION PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS, PARTICULARLY RESPIRATORY PROTECTION

PRODUCTS. ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY SECURITY PRINTING AND SYSTEMS LIMITED, WHICH

WAS ACQUIRED IN AUGUST 2006, ADDED 4.0% TO SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION

SERVICES SALES GROWTH. FOR THE

ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT, SALES

GROWTH WAS LED BY DEMAND FOR 3M ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS FOR SEMICONDUCTOR

MANUFACTURERS, ALONG WITH CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH IN ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS FOR

INSULATING, TESTING AND SENSING. REFER TO THE PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT

SECTION FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS OF THE RESPECTIVE

SEGMENTS.

GEOGRAPHICALLY, U.S.

SALES REVENUE INCREASED 7.1%, ASIA PACIFIC LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES (WHICH EXCLUDE

TRANSLATION IMPACTS) INCREASED 9.2%,

EUROPEAN

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 8.3%, AND THE COMBINED LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA

AREA LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 6.1%.

REFER TO THE PERFORMANCE BY

GEOGRAPHIC AREA SECTION FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS FOR THE

RESPECTIVE AREAS.

OPERATING INCOME

IMPROVEMENT FOR THE YEAR, EXCLUDING THE GAIN ON THE BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

SALE AND RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS, WAS LED BY THE INDUSTRIAL AND

TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT AND THE SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES

SEGMENT. DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS WAS HURT BY SALES PRICE DECLINES, A SALES MIX

SHIFT TOWARDS LARGER LCD DISPLAYS, AND OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS NEW OPTICAL FILM MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION LINE, WHICH HAVE SINCE BEEN

RESOLVED. THE DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT AND ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS

SEGMENT WERE IMPACTED THE MOST BY BUSINESS-SPECIFIC RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS (NOTE

4 AND BUSINESS SEGMENT DISCUSSION). 3MS OPERATING INCOME MARGINS REMAINED AT

HEALTHY LEVELS, EVEN AFTER ADJUSTING FOR NET GAINS RELATED TO THE BRANDED

PHARMACEUTICALS SALE, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS.

FOR THE YEAR 2006

, THE COMPANY UTILIZED $3.7 BILLION OF CASH TO

REPURCHASE 3M COMMON STOCK AND PAY DIVIDENDS. IN AUGUST 2006, 3MS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL $1 BILLION IN SHARE REPURCHASES OF THE

COMPANYS STOCK, RAISING THE TOTAL AUTHORIZATION TO $3 BILLION BETWEEN FEBRUARY

13, 2006 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2007.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, $748 MILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASES.

IN

FEBRUARY 2007, 3MS BOARD AUTHORIZED A DIVIDEND INCREASE OF 4.3% TO 48 CENTS

PER SHARE, EQUIVALENT TO AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF $1.92 PER SHARE FOR 2007,

MARKING THE 49

TH

CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF DIVIDEND INCREASES, AND

ALSO APPROVED A $7 BILLION TWO-YEAR SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION FOR THE

PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 12, 2007 TO FEBRUARY 28, 2009. 3MS DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL

RATIO (TOTAL CAPITAL DEFINED AS DEBT PLUS EQUITY) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 WAS

26%. 3M HAS AN AA CREDIT RATING FROM STANDARD & POORS AND AN AA1 CREDIT

RATING FROM MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE.

IN 2006, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED PRICE INCREASES

AFFECTING METALS, WOOD PULP AND OIL-DERIVED RAW MATERIALS. DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2006 TOTAL MARKET DEMAND FOR METALS AND OIL-DERIVED RAW MATERIALS

BEGAN TO SOFTEN AND THE COMPANY IS THEREFORE PURSUING PRICE REDUCTIONS FOR

THOSE COMMODITIES.

T

HE COMPANY TO

DATE IS RECEIVING SUFFICIENT

13

QUANTITIES OF ALL RAW MATERIALS TO MEET ITS REASONABLY

FORESEEABLE PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS, BUT

IT

IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT FUTURE SHORTAGES OF RAW MATERIALS OR THE IMPACT ANY

SUCH SHORTAGES WOULD HAVE.

3M MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS,

PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS. FLUCTUATIONS

IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ALSO IMPACT RESULTS, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY

MINIMIZES THIS EFFECT THROUGH HEDGING ABOUT HALF OF THIS IMPACT. 3M CONTINUED,

AS IT HAS FOR MANY YEARS, TO INCUR EXPENSES (INSURED AND UNINSURED) IN MANAGING

ITS LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES.

THE SALE OF THE

PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IS NOT PRESENTED AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION DUE TO

THE EXTENT OF THE PROJECTED CONTINUING CASH FLOWS FROM OUR CONTRACTUAL SUPPLY

RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BUYERS IN RELATION TO THOSE OF THE BUSINESS THAT WAS

SOLD. THEREFORE, IT WILL CREATE BOTH A SALES AND PROFITABILITY COMPARABILITY

ISSUE BEGINNING WITH FIRST QUARTER 2007 RESULTS. ANNUAL SALES IN 2006 FOR PHARMACEUTICALS

WERE $774 MILLION, AND REPORTED OPERATING INCOME WAS $1.039 BILLION, INCLUDING

NET GAINS OF $783 MILLION AS DISCUSSED IN THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS

DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS. SALES GROWTH IN 2007 WILL BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AS

THESE PHARMACEUTICAL SALES ARE IN THE BASE 2006 PERIOD. 3MS DRUG DELIVERY

SYSTEMS DIVISION WILL BE A SOURCE OF SUPPLY TO THE ACQUIRING COMPANIES, WITH

EXPECTED ANNUAL REVENUES OF APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION FROM THE VARIOUS

ARRANGEMENTS WITH THE THREE BUYERS.

SUCH OUTSOURCING ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE A LOWER PROFITABILITY THAN THE

OTHER PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS OF MOST OF OUR EXISTING HEALTH CARE

BUSINESSES.

3M RESTRUCTURED

MANY AREAS IN PARALLEL WITH DIVESTING THE GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS. THE GREAT MAJORITY OF THOSE COSTS WILL NOT BE ELIMINATED UNTIL LATE

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OR EARLY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007. EARNINGS GROWTH IS

EXPECTED TO BE SLOWEST IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 DUE TO THESE CONTINUED

EXPENSES AND THE STRONG COMPARABLE FIRST QUARTER IN 2006. 3M EXPECTS EARNINGS

TO IMPROVE SOMEWHAT IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007, AND ACCELERATE MORE INTO THE

SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR.

BEGINNING IN 2007,

THE COMPANY IS MODIFYING ITS LONG-TERM AND SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION

PROGRAMS TO ALIGN EMPLOYEE AND SHAREHOLDER INTERESTS MORE CLOSELY. THE COMPANYS

SHORT-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN IS MOVING AWAY FROM ITS QUARTERLY

YEAR-OVER-YEAR FOCUSED PROFIT SHARING PLAN TOWARD AN ANNUAL BONUS PLAN WITH

PAYOUTS TIED PRINCIPALLY TO PERFORMANCE MEASURED BY THE OPERATING PLAN. THE

COMPANY IS ALSO REDUCING THE NUMBER OF TRADITIONAL STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER

ITS LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES

ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ANNUAL GRANTS AND BY SHIFTING A PORTION OF THE ANNUAL GRANT

AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL STOCK OPTIONS PRIMARILY TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. THESE

CHANGES WILL REDUCE THE ANNUAL DILUTION IMPACT FROM 1.5% OF TOTAL OUTSTANDING

COMMON STOCK TO ABOUT 1%. HOWEVER, ASSOCIATED WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER

OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, THE COMPANY DECIDED TO PROVIDE A ONE-TIME BUYOUT GRANT

TO THE IMPACTED EMPLOYEES, WHICH WILL RESULT IN INCREASED STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN 2007. IN ADDITION, 3MS CHANGE IN THE VESTING PERIOD FOR

STOCK OPTIONS FROM ONE TO THREE YEARS STARTING WITH THE MAY 2005 GRANT ALSO

RESULTS IN HIGHER EXPENSE IN 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO TOTAL $0.21 PER DILUTED SHARE IN 2007, COMPARED WITH

$0.17 PER DILUTED SHARE IN 2006.

THE PRECEDING

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE

RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PROJECTED (REFER TO THE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS SECTION IN ITEM 7 AND THE RISK FACTORS PROVIDED IN ITEM 1A FOR

DISCUSSION OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES).

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, 3M ADOPTED STATEMENT

OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004), SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(SFAS NO. 123R), WHICH REQUIRED 3M TO EXPENSE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. THE

COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123R USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, ALL PRIOR PERIODS WERE REVISED TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE

FAIR-VALUE-BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN FISCAL YEARS

BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 1995.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE

THE $45 MILLION

INCREASE IN STOCK OPTION EXPENSE IN 2006, COMPARED WITH 2005, IS PRIMARILY DUE

TO TWO REASONS. FIRST, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, ACCOUNTING RULES REQUIRED THE

ACCELERATION OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNITION TO WHEN AN

EMPLOYEE IS ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE, INSTEAD OF OVER THE ENTIRE VESTING PERIOD FOR

THESE RETIREMENT-ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, RESULTING IN RECOGNITION OF APPROXIMATELY

25 PERCENT OF THE EXPENSE IN THE MONTH OF GRANT (SECOND QUARTER FOR 3MS ANNUAL

STOCK OPTION GRANT). SECOND, 3M CHANGED ITS VESTING PERIOD FROM ONE TO THREE

YEARS STARTING WITH THE MAY 2005 GRANT. THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2006

INCLUDE EXPENSE FROM BOTH THE 2005 AND 2006 STOCK OPTION GRANTS, WHILE THE

THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2005 ONLY INCLUDE EXPENSE FROM THE 2005 STOCK

OPTION GRANT. THE DECREASE IN THE 2005 EXPENSE, COMPARED WITH 2004, IS PRIMARILY

DUE TO THE CHANGE IN 3MS OPTION VESTING PERIOD.

COST OF SALES.

COST OF SALES INCREASED 1.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2006. APPROXIMATELY

1.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THIS INCREASE RELATED TO NUMEROUS ITEMS, SUCH AS

HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS, SLIGHTLY LOWER SELLING PRICES, AND HIGHER COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH SCALING UP ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY. IN ADDITION,

THERE WERE SUPPLY CHAIN INEFFICIENCIES CAUSED BY CAPACITY-CONSTRAINTS. FINALLY,

WE ACCELERATED THE PACE OF ACQUISITIONS IN 2006, WHICH INCREASED COST OF SALES

SLIGHTLY FOR THE YEAR. AFTER THESE ACQUISITIONS ARE INTEGRATED AND BEGIN

MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTIONS TO GROWTH, WE EXPECT POSITIVE IMPACTS. BROAD-BASED

SALES VOLUME GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY GAINS HELPED OFFSET SOME OF THIS IMPACT.

RAW MATERIAL COSTS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 3% FOR 2006, COMPARED WITH 2005.

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS ALSO NEGATIVELY IMPACTED COST OF SALES BY $143 MILLION,

OR 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

COST OF

SALES INCLUDES MANUFACTURING, ENGINEERING AND FREIGHT COSTS.

COST OF SALES DECREASED 0.8 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT IN 2005. COST OF

SALES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES BENEFITED FROM THE COMBINATION OF IMPROVED

SELLING PRICES, FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS, FACTORY EFFICIENCY

AND SOURCING, WHICH HELPED OFFSET THE IMPACT OF HIGHER RAW MATERIAL PRICES. RAW

MATERIAL COSTS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 6% FOR 2005, COMPARED WITH 2004.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE

OF NET SALES INCREASED 0.2 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD

IN 2005. IN DOLLARS, SG&A INCREASED $435 MILLION, WITH RESTRUCTURING AND

OTHER ITEMS INCREASING SG&A BY $238 MILLION, AND OTHER SPENDING INCREASING

SG&A BY $197 MILLION. 3M CONTINUES TO INVEST IN GROWTH-ORIENTED SG&A AS

SALES AND MARKETING COSTS INCREASED FASTER THAN SALES, WHILE ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT IN DOLLARS, ATTRIBUTABLE IN PART TO

COST-CONTROL EFFORTS.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF

NET SALES DECREASED 0.3 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT WHEN COMPARING 2005 WITH 2004,

PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE DRIVEN BY THE CHANGE IN

VESTING PERIOD FROM ONE TO THREE YEARS (FURTHER DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1). 3M

CONTINUED TO INVEST IN GROWTH PROGRAMS AND BRAND BUILDING THROUGHOUT THE

PORTFOLIO AS A MEANS OF STIMULATING GROWTH.

SG&A IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2005 WAS IMPACTED BY

A PRE-TAX

CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS OF

ONE ANTITRUST CLASS ACTION AND TWO INDIVIDUAL SUCH ACTIONS, ALL INVOLVING

DIRECT PURCHASERS OF TRANSPARENT TAPE.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES INCREASED AS A PERCENT OF

SALES BY 0.6 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT, OR $248 MILLION, WHEN COMPARING 2006 WITH

2005, WHILE DECREASING AS A PERCENT OF SALES BY 0.2 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT WHEN

COMPARING 2005 TO 2004.

THE 2006

SPENDING INCLUDED A $95 MILLION IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGE

(DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2) AND $75 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS (NOTE 4).

OTHER SPENDING INCREASED APPROXIMATELY $78

MILLION, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 6% COMPARED WITH 2005,

REFLECTING 3MS CONTINUING COMMITMENT TO FUND FUTURE GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY.

GAIN ON SALE OF PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS.

IN DECEMBER 2006,

3M COMPLETED THE SALE OF ITS GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESSES IN THE

UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND LATIN AMERICA REGION AND THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION,

INCLUDING AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH AFRICA. 3M RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $1.209 BILLION

FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS AND RECOGNIZED A PRE-TAX GAIN ON SALE OF $1.074 BILLION.

IN JANUARY 2007, 3M COMPLETED THE SALE OF ITS GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS IN EUROPE TO MEDA AB FOR $817 MILLION.

THIS TRANSACTION

WILL BE REFLECTED IN 3MS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDING MARCH 31,

OPERATING INCOME.

3M USES OPERATING INCOME AS ONE OF ITS PRIMARY BUSINESS SEGMENT

PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TOOLS. OPERATING INCOME IN 2006 WAS 24.8% OF SALES, UP

FROM 22.9% OF SALES IN 2005 AND 21.6% OF SALES IN 2004. OPERATING INCOME IN

2006 INCLUDED THE GAIN ON SALE, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS THAT BENEFITED

OPERATING INCOME BY $523 MILLION, OR 2.2% OF NET SALES.

THE TAX RATE FOR 2006 WAS 30.6%, COMPARED WITH 33.7% IN 2005. IN 2005,

THE COMPANY REPATRIATED APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS UNDER

THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (JOBS ACT). REFER TO THE FOLLOWING

PARAGRAPH FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION. NO SIMILAR REPATRIATION OCCURRED IN 2006

SINCE THIS JOBS ACT PROVISION ONLY APPLIED TO 2005. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANYS

TAX RATE DECREASED BY 1.6% IN 2006. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANYS TAX RATE WAS REDUCED BY 1.5% AS A

RESULT OF A NUMBER OF ITEMS (BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE), INCLUDING ADJUSTMENTS

TO ITS RESERVES FOR TAX CONTINGENCIES, THE SALE OF ITS PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS

AND BOOK/TAX DIFFERENCES ON THE WRITE-OFF OF IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT RELATED TO THE BRONTES TECHNOLOGIES INC. (BRONTES) ACQUISITION. REFER TO NOTE 2 AND NOTE 8 FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

THE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2005 WAS 33.7%, COMPARED WITH 32.5% IN 2004. DURING 2005,

3M COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THE REPATRIATION PROVISION OF THE AMERICAN JOBS

CREATION ACT OF 2004 (JOBS ACT) AND REPATRIATED APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION OF

FOREIGN EARNINGS IN THE UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO ITS PROVISIONS. THE JOBS ACT

PROVIDED 3M THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAX-EFFECTIVELY REPATRIATE FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR

U.S. QUALIFYING INVESTMENTS SPECIFIED BY 3MS DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN. AS A

CONSEQUENCE, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005, 3M RECORDED A TAX EXPENSE OF $75

MILLION, NET OF AVAILABLE FOREIGN TAX CREDITS,

WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

THE 2005 EFFECTIVE WORLDWIDE TAX RATE BY 1.6%.

A HALF-POINT TAX RATE REDUCTION, COMPARED WITH 2004, WAS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO A COMBINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF THE MEDICARE MODERNIZATION ACT

AND THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS DEDUCTION, WHICH WAS A PART OF THE JOBS ACT.

CONSOLIDATED ENTITY WITH NON-3M OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IS SUMITOMO 3M LIMITED IN

JAPAN (3M OWNS 75% OF SUMITOMO 3M LIMITED). THE DECREASE IN 2006 RELATED

PRIMARILY TO FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EFFECTS WHICH REDUCED SUMITOMO 3M

LIMITEDS OPERATING INCOME AS REPORTED IN U.S. DOLLARS, AS THE U.S. DOLLAR

STRENGTHENED SIGNIFICANTLY AGAINST THE JAPANESE YEN, COMPARED WITH 2005. THE

DECREASE IN 2005 RELATED PRIMARILY TO LOWER NET INCOME IN SUMITOMO 3M.

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 47, ACCOUNTING FOR

CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FIN 47). THIS ACCOUNTING

STANDARD APPLIES TO THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND

WHERE THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY

17

ESTIMATED.

CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS EXIST FOR CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS

LONG-TERM ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE OBLIGATIONS IS RECORDED AS

LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS. OVER TIME THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR

THE CHANGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE AND THE INITIAL CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE

DEPRECIATED OVER THE USEFUL LIVES OF THE RELATED ASSETS. THE ADOPTION OF FIN 47

RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION LIABILITY OF $59

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $35 MILLION FOR 2005,

WHICH WAS REFLECTED AS A CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE PRO FORMA EFFECT OF APPLYING THIS

GUIDANCE IN ALL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED WAS DETERMINED NOT TO BE MATERIAL. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION LIABILITY WAS $57 MILLION.

CURRENCY EFFECTS.

3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR CURRENCY EFFECTS, INCLUDING HEDGING

IMPACTS, INCREASED NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION IN 2006, $115

MILLION IN 2005 AND $181 MILLION IN 2004. THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF

TRANSLATING PROFITS FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS; THE IMPACT OF

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF GOODS BETWEEN 3M OPERATIONS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND ABROAD; AND TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISKS.

3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTION GAINS AND

LOSSES HAD AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT ON NET INCOME IN 2006 AND INCREASED NET INCOME

BY APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION IN 2005 AND $48 MILLION IN 2004.

THE INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT SERVES A BROAD RANGE OF

MARKETS, SUCH AS APPLIANCE, PAPER AND PACKAGING, FOOD AND BEVERAGE, PERSONAL

CARE AND AUTOMOTIVE. INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION PRODUCTS INCLUDE TAPES, A

WIDE VARIETY OF COATED AND NON-WOVEN ABRASIVES, ADHESIVES, SPECIALTY MATERIALS,

SUPPLY CHAIN EXECUTION SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS, CLOSURES FOR DISPOSABLE DIAPERS, AND

COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED IN THE MANUFACTURE, REPAIR AND

MAINTENANCE OF AUTOMOTIVE, MARINE, AIRCRAFT AND SPECIALTY VEHICLES. THE AUGUST

2005 ACQUISITION OF CUNO ADDS A COMPREHENSIVE LINE OF FILTRATION PRODUCTS FOR

THE SEPARATION, CLARIFICATION AND PURIFICATION OF FLUIDS AND GASES.

IN 2006,

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GREW 9.1%, INCLUDING 4.6% GROWTH FROM ACQUISITIONS,

PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE AUGUST 2005 ACQUISITION OF CUNO. SINCE CUNO WAS

ACQUIRED IN EARLY AUGUST 2005 AND IS THUS CONSIDERED PART OF ORGANIC GROWTH

EFFECTIVE IN AUGUST 2006, THE ACQUISITION BENEFIT REFLECTED IN 2006 ONLY

REFLECTS THE MONTHS FROM JANUARY 2006 THROUGH JULY 2006. THE INDUSTRIAL

ADHESIVES AND TAPES BUSINESS, ALONG WITH THE AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESS,

WHICH SELLS PRODUCTS TO BODY SHOPS FOR VEHICLE REPAIRS, LED ORGANIC SALES

GROWTH IN 2006. 3M ALSO POSTED GOOD SALES GROWTH IN ITS ABRASIVES BUSINESS AND

ITS ENERGY AND ADVANCED MATERIALS BUSINESS. GROWTH IN THE AUTOMOTIVE OEM

BUSINESS CONTINUES TO BE IMPACTED BY SOFTNESS IN THE U.S. DOMESTIC AUTOMOTIVE

INDUSTRY AS NEW CAR BUILDS CONTINUE TO REMAIN SOFT. GEOGRAPHICALLY,

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH IN DOLLARS WAS STRONGEST IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AND

EUROPE AREAS. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 10.9% TO $1.343 BILLION IN 2006.

2005 CUNO ACQUISITION, WHOSE RESULTS ARE INCLUDED IN INDUSTRIAL AND

TRANSPORTATION, ADDED 3.1% OF GROWTH IN 2005. IN ADDITION, GROWTH WAS LED BY

THE ADHESIVES, TAPES, AND ABRASIVES BUSINESSES. 3M CONTINUED TO SELECTIVELY

RAISE SELLING PRICES TO OFFSET COMMODITY RAW MATERIAL PRICE PRESSURES. 3M SALES

GROWTH ALSO BENEFITED FROM CUSTOMER-FOCUSED NEW PRODUCTS AND PRODUCTIVITY

SOLUTIONS DRIVING RESULTS. ONE OF THESE NEW PRODUCTS IS

3M

 PAINT REPLACEMENT

FILM, WHICH IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO USING PAINT AROUND CAR AND TRUCK WINDOWS. IN

THE AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET AREA, THE 3M PAINT PREPARATION SYSTEM SHORTENS PAINT CHANGEOVER AND CLEANUP TIME WHILE ALSO

REDUCING THE USE OF SOLVENTS FOR CLEANING PAINT GUNS. SALES GROWTH IN

TRANSPORTATION WAS LED BY BUSINESSES THAT SERVE THE AUTOMOTIVE OEMS AND AUTO

BODY REPAIR SHOPS, DESPITE CHALLENGES IN THE U.S. OEM BIG-3 AUTOMOTIVE MARKET

ALONG WITH LOWER LEVELS OF DISTRIBUTION BUY-IN (DUE TO CASH FLOW TRADE-OFFS BY

CUSTOMERS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESS).

THE STRENGTH OF THE INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESSES HELPED

OVERCOME THE SALES GROWTH CHALLENGES OF THE PERSONAL CARE BUSINESS. PERSONAL

CARE, WHICH IS 3MS DIAPER TAPE BUSINESS, HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT RAW

MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES IN SOME PRODUCT LINES OVER THE PAST YEAR, AND 3M HAS

ELECTED TO DRIVE PROFITS AT THE EXPENSE OF VOLUME IN THIS BUSINESS. INDUSTRIAL

AND TRANSPORTATION CONTINUES TO DEMONSTRATE STRONG OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE, AS

OPERATING INCOME GREW 15.4% IN 2005.

IN MARCH 2005, 3MS

INCLUDES

OPTICAL FILM AND LENS

SOLUTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DISPLAYS; TOUCH SCREENS AND TOUCH MONITORS; COMPUTER

SCREEN FILTERS; REFLECTIVE SHEETING FOR TRANSPORTATION SAFETY; AND

COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS SYSTEMS. THE OPTICAL FILM

BUSINESS

PROVIDES FILMS

THAT SERVE NUMEROUS MARKET SEGMENTS OF THE DISPLAY LIGHTING INDUSTRY. 3M

PROVIDES DISTINCT PRODUCTS FOR FIVE MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS FOR: 1)

LCD COMPUTER MONITORS, 2) LCD TELEVISIONS, 3) HAND-HELD DEVICES SUCH AS

CELLULAR PHONES, 4) NOTEBOOK PCS AND 5) AUTOMOTIVE DISPLAYS. THE OPTICAL

BUSINESS INCLUDES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THAT ARE PROTECTED BY VARIOUS

PATENTS AND GROUPS OF PATENTS. THE REMAINING LIFETIMES OF SUCH PATENTS, AS WELL

AS PATENTS PROTECTING FUTURE PRODUCTS, RANGE FROM LESS THAN A FEW YEARS TO MORE

THAN 15 YEARS. THESE PATENTS PROVIDE VARYING MEASURES OF EXCLUSIVITY TO 3M FOR

A NUMBER OF SUCH PRODUCTS. 3MS PROPRIETARY MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY AND

KNOW-HOW ALSO PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO 3M INDEPENDENT OF SUCH

PATENTS.

IN

2006, THE DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS BUSINESS POSTED LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH OF

6.9%. OPTICAL FILM SALES VOLUMES INCREASED AT DOUBLE-DIGIT RATES IN 2006. 3M

SAW AN ACCELERATION IN THE LCD INDUSTRY DUE TO STRONG CONSUMER DEMAND FOR LCD

TVS, WHICH DROVE RECORD SALES OF 3MS PROPRIETARY OPTICAL FILMS, DESPITE

ONGOING DOWNWARD PRICING PRESSURE IN THESE CONSUMER ELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS.

COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS, A SUPPLIER OF LARGE-FORMAT GRAPHICS SOLUTIONS THAT CUT

ACROSS A RANGE OF INDUSTRIES, DELIVERED STRONG DOUBLE-DIGIT LOCAL-CURRENCY

GROWTH IN 2006. TRAFFIC SAFETY SYSTEMS ALSO POSTED SOLID LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH.

OPERATING INCOME DECLINED BY 8.6%. OPERATING INCOME INCLUDED $39 MILLION IN

RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND SEVERANCE

THESE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS RELATE TO DECISIONS

THE COMPANY MADE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006 TO EXIT CERTAIN MARGINAL PRODUCT

LINES IN THE TOUCH SYSTEMS AND OPTICAL SYSTEMS BUSINESSES. IN OPTICAL FILM, SELLING PRICE DECLINES, THE

SALES MIX SHIFT TOWARDS LARGER LCD DISPLAYS, AND OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES RELATED

TO THE COMPANYS NEW OPTICAL FILM MANUFACTURING PRODUCTION LINE PENALIZED OPERATING INCOME IN 2006.

IN 2005, DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GREW 4.7%, IMPACTED

BY MANY FACTORS. THE FIRST HALF OF 2005 WAS TEMPERED BY TOUGH YEAR-ON-YEAR

OPTICAL FILM COMPARISONS, WHILE 3MS TRAFFIC SAFETY SYSTEMS BUSINESS AWAITED A

NEW HIGHWAY FUNDING BILL IN THE UNITED STATES AND THE SLUGGISH ECONOMIES IN

WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN HELD BACK GROWTH IN THE COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS BUSINESS.

GROWTH REBOUNDED IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2005 AS A NEW U.S. HIGHWAY FUNDING BILL

WAS PASSED IN JULY, THE ECONOMIES IN WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN STARTED TO SHOW

SOME MODERATE GROWTH AND, AS EXPECTED, 3M SAW ACCELERATION IN DEMAND FOR CONSUMER

ELECTRONICS, ESPECIALLY FLAT-PANEL LCD TELEVISIONS AND A MORE NORMAL LCD

COMPONENT INVENTORY SITUATION. THIS GROWTH IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2005 DROVE

RECORD SALES OF 3MS PROPRIETARY OPTICAL FILMS AND COMPONENTS DESPITE GROWING

PRICING PRESSURE. THE CONTINUED DECLINE IN LENS SYSTEMS FOR THE CRT REAR

PROJECTION TELEVISION MARKET NEGATIVELY IMPACTED DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SALES

GROWTH BY APPROXIMATELY 3% IN 2005 AND NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING INCOME BY

WHICH SELLS A NUMBER OF INSULATING, TESTING AND CONNECTING PRODUCTS AND

SOLUTIONS TO BOTH POWER UTILITIES AND MANUFACTURING OEMS. 3M ALSO CONTINUES TO

SEE GOOD GROWTH FROM ITS ELECTRONICS MARKETS BUSINESS, DRIVEN BY DOUBLE-DIGIT

GROWTH IN ITS SEMI-CONDUCTOR AND ASSEMBLIES BUSINESS.

PARTIALLY OFFSETTING THIS WAS SOME SALES

SOFTNESS IN OUR U.S. COMMUNICATIONS MARKETS BUSINESS DUE TO HIGHER COPPER

COSTS. OPERATING INCOME DECLINED

BY 2.1% TO $438 MILLION. OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES $46 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING

EXPENSES, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND SEVERANCE AND RELATED

BENEFITS, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING INCOME GROWTH BY 10.3%. OPERATING MARGINS CONTINUE TO BE IMPACTED BY

RISING RAW MATERIAL COSTS, SPECIFICALLY COPPER COSTS, IN OUR ELECTRICAL AND

TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKETS BUSINESSES.

IN 2005, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES IN ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS INCREASED

4.2%, WITH IMPROVING END MARKET CONDITIONS AND SUCCESS IN DEVELOPING NEW

APPLICATIONS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS INTO NEW APPLICATIONS HELPING THE BUSINESS

POST ITS BEST LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH SINCE 2000. LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH

ACCELERATED IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2005, WITH LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005 UP 10.9%. LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH WAS LED BY DEMAND FOR 3M

ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS FROM SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURERS, ALONG WITH CONTINUED

STRONG GROWTH IN ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS USED FOR INSULATING, TESTING AND SENSING.

THIS STRONG SALES GROWTH HELPED OFFSET WEAKNESS IN THE ELECTRONIC SOLUTIONS AND

COMMUNICATIONS MARKETS. OPERATING MARGINS WERE 19.2% IN 2005, WITH OPERATING

INCOME INCREASING 41.5% IN 2005.

WHILE

3M MANAGES ITS BUSINESSES GLOBALLY AND BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

ARE THE MOST RELEVANT MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES

GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA AS A SECONDARY PERFORMANCE MEASURE. EXPORT SALES ARE

REPORTED WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WHERE THE FINAL SALES TO 3M CUSTOMERS ARE

MADE. A PORTION

OF THE PRODUCTS OR

COMPONENTS SOLD BY 3MS OPERATIONS TO ITS CUSTOMERS ARE EXPORTED BY THESE

CUSTOMERS TO DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AS CUSTOMERS MOVE THEIR OPERATIONS

FROM ONE GEOGRAPHIC AREA TO ANOTHER, 3MS RESULTS WILL FOLLOW. THUS, NET SALES

IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF END-USER CONSUMPTION IN

THAT GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

U.S. SALES REVENUE

INCREASED 7.1%, AS ALL SIX BUSINESS SEGMENTS CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCREASE. ASIA

PACIFIC LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES (WHICH EXCLUDE TRANSLATION IMPACTS) INCREASED

9.2%. ALL SIX BUSINESS SEGMENTS CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCREASE IN THE ASIA

PACIFIC AREA, WITH OPTICAL FILM BEING THE LARGEST GROWTH COMPONENT. SALES IN

JAPAN TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION, WITH LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES UP 1.5% FROM

2005.

EUROPEAN LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES

INCREASED 8.3%, WITH GOOD GROWTH IN INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION AND SAFETY,

SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES. IN THE COMBINED LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA

AREA, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASES OF 6.1% WERE LED BY INDUSTRIAL AND

TRANSPORTATION, SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES AND CONSUMER AND

OFFICE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION POSITIVELY IMPACTED THE COMBINED

LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA AREA SALES BY 4.4%, AND THE EUROPEAN AREA SALES BY

1.4%, AS THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENED AGAINST THESE CURRENCIES. FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION HAD A MINIMAL IMPACT ON ASIA PACIFIC SALES.

FOR 2006, INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS REPRESENTED 61.4% OF 3MS SALES.

SINCE

3M SOLD ITS GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IN DECEMBER 2006 AND

JANUARY 2007, BOTH SALES GROWTH AND OPERATING INCOME WILL BE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED IN 2007. SALES IN 2006 FOR PHARMACEUTICALS TOTALED $332 MILLION IN THE

UNITED STATES, $315 MILLION IN THE EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA AREA, $77

MILLION IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA, AND $50 MILLION IN THE LATIN AMERICA AND

CANADA AREA.

THE GAIN ON

SALE, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS IN 2006, AS DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING

EMPLOYMENT.

EMPLOYMENT INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 4,100 PEOPLE SINCE YEAR-END 2005,

PARTIALLY DUE TO ACQUISITIONS, WITH MORE THAN 750 PEOPLE ADDED BY OUR THREE

LARGEST 2006 ACQUISITIONS ALONE. IN ADDITION, 3M HAS INCREASED EMPLOYEES IN

FASTER-GROWING AREAS OF THE WORLD, SUCH AS BRAZIL, INDIA, RUSSIA, CHINA AND

POLAND, WHERE ON A LOCAL-CURRENCY BASIS SALES INCREASED MORE

25

THAN 20% IN 2006. THE INCREASE IN 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 OF

APPROXIMATELY 3,000 PEOPLE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE AUGUST 2005

ACQUISITION OF CUNO, WHICH ADDED APPROXIMATELY 2,300 EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYMENT

INCREASES

AT A MANUFACTURING PLANT IN LATIN AMERICA ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO

INCREASES OF APPROXIMATELY 600 PEOPLE AND 700 PEOPLE IN 2006 AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY.

SALES PER EMPLOYEE IN LOCAL

CURRENCIES INCREASED 7.7% IN 2006, APPROXIMATELY 3% IN 2005 AND APPROXIMATELY

7% IN 2004.

CAPITAL SPENDING/NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

THE BULK OF 3M CAPITAL SPENDING HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES,

RESULTING IN HIGHER NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT BALANCES IN THE UNITED

STATES. THE COMPANY IS STRIVING TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN ITS MANUFACTURING AND

SOURCING WITH GEOGRAPHIC MARKET SALES, AND BECAUSE MORE THAN 60% OF SALES ARE

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THIS WOULD INCREASE PRODUCTION OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES, HELPING TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND REDUCE WORKING CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE FROM THIS $1.168 BILLION

IN 2006 TO $1.4 BILLION TO $1.5 BILLION IN 2007. THE MAJORITY OF THIS SPENDING

IS AIMED DIRECTLY AT ACCELERATING TOP-LINE GROWTH IN MANY OF OUR CORE

BUSINESSES. 3M HAS ABOUT 15 SIGNIFICANT PLANT CONSTRUCTION PROJECTS UNDER WAY,

SOME ADDING TO EXISTING FACILITIES AND A FEW OF THE GREENFIELD VARIETY.

INTERNATIONALLY, 3M IS BUILDING RESPIRATORY PROTECTION CAPACITY IN RUSSIA AND

KOREA, MEDICAL PRODUCTS CAPACITY IN CHINA, AN LCD PLANT IN POLAND, ABRASIVES

AND TAPE CAPACITY IN CHINA AND INDIA, AND CHEMICAL FACILITIES IN CHINA, JUST TO

NAME A FEW. THIS IS BACKED UP BY SIMILAR INVESTMENTS IN THE U.S.

CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES

INFORMATION REGARDING SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN

NOTE 1. AS STATED IN NOTE 1, THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS

OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF

CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER

THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS

ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY

APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES RELATE TO

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, THE COMPANYS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS. SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT, SELECTION

AND DISCLOSURE OF ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF

3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE CATEGORIES OF CLAIMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ESTIMATED ITS

PROBABLE LIABILITY, THE AMOUNT OF ITS LIABILITY ACCRUALS, AND THE ESTIMATES OF

ITS RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES ARE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES RELATED TO

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. PLEASE REFER TO THE SECTION ENTITLED ACCRUED LIABILITIES

AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTAINED IN LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS IN NOTE 13) FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH ESTIMATES.

PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS.

3M HAS VARIOUS

COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES

AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE

BENEFIT PLANS IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

(SFAS) NO. 87, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS, SFAS NO. 106, EMPLOYERS

ACCOUNTING FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, IN MEASURING PLAN

ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF NET PERIODIC

BENEFIT COST, AND SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS

NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R), WHICH WAS ISSUED IN SEPTEMBER 2006 AND EFFECTIVE

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. SFAS NO. 158 REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO RECOGNIZE THE

UNDERFUNDED OR OVERFUNDED STATUS OF A DEFINED BENEFIT POSTRETIREMENT PLAN AS AN

ASSET OR LIABILITY IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND RECOGNIZE CHANGES

IN THE FUNDED STATUS IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR THROUGH ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH IS A COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. AS A

RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SFAS NO. 158, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN

AFTER-TAX DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $1.187 BILLION

AND $513 MILLION FOR THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION BENEFIT PLANS,

RESPECTIVELY, AND $218 MILLION FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE

INSURANCE BENEFIT PLAN.

PENSION BENEFITS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANS ARE GENERALLY BASED PRIMARILY ON EACH PARTICIPANTS

YEARS OF SERVICE, COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. TWO

CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS,

ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND LIABILITY MEASUREMENT. THE ASSUMED HEALTH

CARE TREND RATE IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE ASSUMPTION.

SEE NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN

DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES.

THE

COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE

DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLANS. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED

LIABILITIES COULD BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ESTIMATING

THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT

26

RATES

OF RETURN ON FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS OF SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN

THE PLAN THAT RECEIVE HIGH, INVESTMENT GRADE RATINGS BY RECOGNIZED RATINGS

AGENCIES. USING THIS METHODOLOGY, THE COMPANY DETERMINED A DISCOUNT RATE OF

5.75% TO BE APPROPRIATE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF

0.25 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT FROM THE RATE USED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.

A SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT IN

DETERMINING THE COMPANYS PENSION EXPENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 87

IS THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, WHICH IS BASED ON HISTORICAL RESULTS FOR

SIMILAR ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANYS

ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.75% FOR 2006 AND WILL

REMAIN AT 8.75% FOR 2007. REFER TO NOTE 11 FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THIS RATE IS

DETERMINED.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005,

THE COMPANY CONVERTED TO THE RP (RETIREMENT PLANS) 2000 MORTALITY TABLE FOR

CALCULATING THE YEAR-END 2005 U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND

2006 EXPENSE. THE IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE INCREASED THE YEAR-END 2005 U.S.

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR PENSION BY $385 MILLION, THE YEAR-END 2005

U.S. ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR PENSION BY $349 MILLION AND THE 2005

U.S. ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $93 MILLION. THIS CHANGE

ALSO INCREASED PENSION EXPENSES FOR 2006 BY $64 MILLION AND POSTRETIREMENT

EXPENSES BY $17 MILLION.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED TOTAL CONSOLIDATED PRE-TAX

PENSION EXPENSE (AFTER SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS AND SPECIAL TERMINATION

BENEFITS) OF $347 MILLION, UP FROM $331 MILLION IN 2005. PENSION EXPENSE

(BEFORE SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS AND SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS) IS

ANTICIPATED TO DECREASE TO APPROXIMATELY $174 MILLION IN 2007. FOR THE

PENSION PLANS, HOLDING ALL OTHER FACTORS CONSTANT, AN INCREASE/DECREASE IN THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS BY 0.25 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT

WOULD DECREASE/INCREASE U.S. 2007 PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY

$24 MILLION FOR U.S. PENSION PLANS AND APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION FOR

INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS. ALSO, HOLDING ALL OTHER FACTORS CONSTANT, AN INCREASE/DECREASE

IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES BY 0.25 OF A PERCENTAGE

POINT WOULD DECREASE/INCREASE 2006 PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $32 MILLION

FOR U.S. PENSION PLANS AND APPROXIMATELY $17 MILLION FOR INTERNATIONAL PENSION

PLANS. SEE NOTE 11 FOR DETAILS OF THE IMPACT OF A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT

CHANGE IN ASSUMED HEALTH CARE TREND RATES ON THE POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE

BENEFIT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATION.

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS.

3M NET PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT TOTALED $5.9 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. MANAGEMENT MAKES

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR WHICH ACTUAL RESULTS WILL EMERGE OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THIS INCLUDES

THE RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EMPLOYED IN THE BUSINESS, INCLUDING

ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE CLOSELY

MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND PERIODICALLY ADJUSTED AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. FOR

INSTANCE, EXPECTED ASSET LIVES MAY BE SHORTENED OR AN IMPAIRMENT RECORDED BASED

ON A CHANGE IN THE EXPECTED USE OF THE ASSET OR PERFORMANCE OF THE RELATED

BUSINESS REPORTING UNIT. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY SOLD

ITS BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS. IN EXITING THIS BUSINESS, THE COMPANY

INCURRED $61 MILLION OF ASSET IMPAIRMENTS FOR THIS BUSINESS AS ASSETS THAT WERE

NOT SOLD WITH THE TRANSACTIONS DID NOT HAVE FUTURE VALUE TO THE COMPANY. DURING

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006 THE COMPANY ALSO DECIDED TO EXIT CERTAIN PRODUCT

LINES, RESULTING IN FIXED AND INTANGIBLE ASSET IMPAIRMENT COSTS OF $83 MILLION.

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS IMPACTED BY THESE PRODUCT EXITS WAS DETERMINED

BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. SEE NOTE 4 FOR FURTHER DETAILS OF THE 2006

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS.

3M GOODWILL TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $4.1 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WHICH, BASED ON IMPAIRMENT

TESTING, IS NOT IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR GOODWILL IS DONE AT A

REPORTING UNIT LEVEL. REPORTING UNITS ARE ONE LEVEL BELOW THE BUSINESS SEGMENT

LEVEL, BUT CAN BE COMBINED WHEN REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE SAME SEGMENT HAVE

SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. THE MAJORITY OF GOODWILL RELATES TO AND IS

ASSIGNED DIRECTLY TO A SPECIFIC REPORTING UNIT. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS GENERALLY

WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNITS NET ASSETS

EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED USING EARNINGS FOR THE REPORTING UNIT

MULTIPLIED BY A PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO FOR COMPARABLE INDUSTRY GROUPS, OR BY

USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JUNE 2006, THE

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

(FIN

48). FIN 48 PRESCRIBES A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THRESHOLD FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN

A TAX RETURN. THIS INTERPRETATION ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF

INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED

INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES

ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES IN INTERIM PERIODS,

AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. THIS INTERPRETATION IS EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1,

2007 AND THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS, IF ANY, OF APPLYING THIS INTERPRETATION WILL

BE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF FIN 48 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

27

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87,

88, 106 AND 132(R).  REFER TO NOTE 11

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS STANDARD.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

REGARDING OTHER ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 1.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

THE

COMPANY GENERATES SIGNIFICANT ONGOING CASH FLOW. NET DEBT INCREASED SLIGHTLY IN

2006, PRIMARILY RELATED TO INCREASED SHORT-TERM DEBT SUPPORTING SHARE

REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES AND ACQUISITIONS. THE INCREASE IN 2005 PRIMARILY RELATED

TO THE $1.36 BILLION CUNO ACQUISITION.

CASH TO FUND EXPECTED INVESTMENTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE COMPANY HAS AN

AA CREDIT RATING FROM STANDARD & POORS AND AN AA1 CREDIT RATING FROM MOODYS

INVESTORS SERVICE. THE COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS TO MEET

CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED GROWTH AND ACQUISITION INVESTMENT FUNDING NEEDS. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT UTILIZE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS LINKED TO THE COMPANYS STOCK.

HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DOES HAVE CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT THAT, IF

CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, IS CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF 3M COMMON

STOCK (REFER TO NOTE 10 IN THIS DOCUMENT).

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY ARE STRONG.

VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING CASH AND

SHORT-TERM DEBT, CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MONTH TO MONTH DEPENDING ON

SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

WORKING

CAPITAL (DEFINED AS CURRENT ASSETS MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES) TOTALED $1.623

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, COMPARED WITH $1.877 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2005. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN DEBT CLASSIFIED AS

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, PARTIALLY OFFSET

BY INCREASES IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES,

AND INVENTORIES.

THE

COMPANY USES VARIOUS WORKING CAPITAL MEASURES THAT PLACE EMPHASIS AND FOCUS ON

CERTAIN WORKING CAPITAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THESE MEASURES ARE NOT DEFINED

UNDER U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND MAY NOT BE COMPUTED THE

SAME AS

SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. ONE OF THE

PRIMARY WORKING CAPITAL MEASURES

3M USES IS

A COMBINED INDEX, WHICH INCLUDES ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES, INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE. THIS COMBINED INDEX (DEFINED AS QUARTERLY NET SALES  FOURTH QUARTER

AT YEAR-END  MULTIPLIED BY FOUR, DIVIDED BY ENDING NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

PLUS INVENTORY LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE) WAS 5.4 AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, DOWN FROM

5.7 AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. RECEIVABLES INCREASED $264 MILLION, OR 9.3%, COMPARED

WITH DECEMBER 31, 2005. CURRENCY TRANSLATION (DUE TO THE STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR)

INCREASED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BY $113 MILLION YEAR-ON-YEAR. INVENTORIES

INCREASED $439 MILLION, OR 20.3%, COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2005. CURRENCY

TRANSLATION INCREASED INVENTORIES BY $92 MILLION YEAR-ON-YEAR. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE

INCREASED $146 MILLION COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2005, WITH $53 MILLION

OF THIS YEAR-ON-YEAR INCREASE RELATED TO CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES ARE

CASH FLOWS FROM

OPERATING ACTIVITIES CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, AS

PENSION FUNDING DECISIONS, TAX TIMING DIFFERENCES AND OTHER ITEMS CAN

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT CASH FLOWS. IN 2006, CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING

ACTIVITIES DECREASED $365 MILLION.

THIS DECREASE WAS DUE IN LARGE PART TO AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $600

MILLION IN TAX PAYMENTS IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005. THE HIGHER TAX PAYMENTS IN

2006 PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE COMPANYS REPATRIATION OF $1.7 BILLION OF FOREIGN

EARNINGS IN THE UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE AMERICAN JOBS

CREATION ACT OF 2004. THE CATEGORY OTHER-NET IN THE PRECEDING TABLE

REFLECTS CHANGES IN OTHER ASSET AND LIABILITY ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING

OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006,

RELATED TO 3MS RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS (NOTE 4).

IN

2005, CASH FLOW WAS ESSENTIALLY FLAT WHEN COMPARED WITH 2004. HIGHER NET

INCOME, HIGHER ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND INCREASED INSURANCE RECEIVABLE COLLECTIONS

WERE OFFSET BY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASES, INVENTORY INCREASES AND OTHER

ITEMS. PRODUCT AND OTHER INSURANCE RECEIVABLES AND CLAIMS INCREASED CASH FLOW

BY $122 MILLION IN 2005, BENEFITING FROM THE $148 MILLION IN INSURANCE

RECOVERIES FOR THE BREAST IMPLANT MATTER IN 2005.

THE CATEGORY OTHER  NET IN THE PRECEDING TABLE REFLECTS CHANGES IN

OTHER ASSET AND LIABILITY ACCOUNTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2005, THIS CATEGORY

INCLUDES THE NON-CASH IMPACT OF ADOPTING FIN 47 ($35 MILLION CUMULATIVE EFFECT

OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE), INCREASES IN ACCRUED LIABILITIES (SUCH AS THE $30

MILLION INCREASE IN LIABILITY RELATED TO LEGAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS), AND

OTHER ITEMS.

IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY MADE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $200

MILLION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. IN 2005, THE COMPANY MADE

DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $500 MILLION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION

PLAN, WITH $200 MILLION CONTRIBUTED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, AND $300

MILLION CONTRIBUTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004,

THE COMPANY MADE A SPECIAL PENSION CONTRIBUTION TO 3MS JAPANESE PENSION PLAN

OF $155 MILLION AND A DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION OF $300 MILLION TO ITS

U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL DEPEND ON MARKET

CONDITIONS, INTEREST RATES AND OTHER FACTORS. 3M BELIEVES ITS STRONG CASH FLOW

AND BALANCE SHEET WILL ALLOW IT TO FUND FUTURE PENSION NEEDS WITHOUT

COMPROMISING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $1.168 BILLION IN

2006, AN INCREASE OF $225 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2005, AS 3M INVESTED IN

A NUMBER OF GROWING AND HIGHLY PROFITABLE BUSINESSES SUCH AS MEDICAL,

RESPIRATORY PROTECTION, LCD FILMS AND OTHERS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY

$1.4 BILLION TO $1.5 BILLION IN 2007. REFER TO THE PRECEDING 

CAPITAL SPENDING/NET

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT SECTION FOR MORE DETAIL.

REFER TO NOTE 2 FOR

INFORMATION ON 2006, 2005 AND 2004 ACQUISITIONS. NOTE 2 ALSO PROVIDES

INFORMATION ON THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL

ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, AND FROM TIME TO TIME MAY

ALSO DIVEST CERTAIN BUSINESSES.

PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND

INVESTMENTS AND PROCEEDS FROM SALE (OR MATURITIES) OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND

INVESTMENTS IN 2006 AND 2005 ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AUCTION RATE AND

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. 2006

INCLUDES PURCHASES, NET OF SALES AND MATURITIES, OF $637 MILLION FOR MARKETABLE

SECURITIES. PRIOR TO 2005, PURCHASES OF AND PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF AUCTION

RATE SECURITIES WERE CLASSIFIED AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. AT DECEMBER 31,

2004, THE AMOUNT OF SUCH SECURITIES TAKEN AS A WHOLE WAS IMMATERIAL TO CASH AND

CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND ACCORDINGLY WAS NOT RECLASSIFIED FOR 2004 AND PRIOR.

PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS IN 2005 INCLUDE

THE PURCHASE OF 19% OF TI&M BETEILIGUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH (DISCUSSED

PREVIOUSLY UNDER THE INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS SEGMENT). THE

PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION IS REPORTED AS INVESTMENTS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND AS PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND

INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

ADDITIONAL P

TOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER

31, 2006, WAS $3.553 BILLION, UP FROM $2.381 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2005, WITH THE

INCREASE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES AND THE

NOVEMBER 2006 ISSUANCE

OF A THREE-YEAR, $400 MILLION, MEDIUM-TERM NOTE.

IN 2006, THE INCREASE

IN NET SHORT-TERM DEBT OF $882 MILLION INCLUDES THE PORTION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT

WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF 90 DAYS OR LESS, WHICH PRIMARILY REPRESENTS

COMMERCIAL PAPER ACTIVITY. THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT FOR MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90

DAYS ALSO PRIMARILY RELATES TO COMMERCIAL PAPER ACTIVITY.

TOTAL DEBT WAS 26% OF TOTAL CAPITAL

(TOTAL

CAPITAL IS DEFINED AS DEBT PLUS EQUITY),

COMPARED WITH 19% AT YEAR-END 2005.

DEBT SECURITIES,

INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHELF REGISTRATION, ITS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM,

DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES AND CONVERTIBLE NOTE, ARE ALL DISCUSSED IN MORE

DETAIL IN NOTE 10. 3M HAS A SHELF REGISTRATION AND MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM

THROUGH WHICH $1.5 BILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MAY BE OFFERED. IN NOVEMBER

2006, THE COMPANY ISSUED $400 MILLION UNDER ITS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM. IN

2004, THE COMPANY ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $62 MILLION IN DEBT SECURITIES UNDER

THIS PROGRAM.

THE

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM AND SHELF REGISTRATION HAVE REMAINING CAPACITY OF

APPROXIMATELY $1.038 BILLION. T

HE COMPANYS $350 MILLION OF DEALER

REMARKETABLE SECURITIES (CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT) WERE

REMARKETED FOR ONE YEAR IN DECEMBER 2006. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS

CONVERTIBLE NOTES WITH A BOOK VALUE OF $542 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE

NEXT PUT OPTION DATE FOR THESE CONVERTIBLE NOTES IS NOVEMBER 2007. AT DECEMBER

31, 2006, THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES, DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES, $62 MILLION OF

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES, AND $71 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE NOTES ARE CLASSIFIED AS

CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS THE RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED

WITH THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT

WILL AFFECT ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE, REFER TO NOTE 1 FOR

DISCUSSION OF EITF

ISSUE NO. 04-08, THE

EFFECT OF CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT ON DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND

PROPOSED SFAS NO. 128R, EARNINGS PER SHARE.

REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK ARE MADE TO SUPPORT THE COMPANYS

STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS AND FOR OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES.

ON FEBRUARY 13, 2006, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

AUTHORIZED THE PURCHASE OF $2.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK BETWEEN

FEBRUARY 13, 2006 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2007. ON AUGUST 15, 2006, THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL $1 BILLION IN SHARE REPURCHASES, RAISING THE

TOTAL AUTHORIZATION TO $3 BILLION FOR THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 13, 2006 TO

FEBRUARY 28, 2007. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, $748 MILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR

REPURCHASE. REFER TO THE TABLE CAPTIONED ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

IN PART II, ITEM 5, FOR MORE INFORMATION.

CASH DIVIDENDS

PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS TOTALED $1.376 BILLION ($1.84 PER SHARE) IN 2006, $1.286

BILLION ($1.68 PER SHARE) IN 2005 AND $1.125 BILLION ($1.44 PER SHARE) IN 2004.

3M HAS PAID DIVIDENDS SINCE 1916.

OTHER CASH

FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE DISTRIBUTIONS TO MINORITY INTERESTS,

CHANGES IN CASH OVERDRAFT BALANCES, AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FOR CAPITAL LEASES.

LIQUIDITY.

THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY

REMAINS STRONG. CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT DECEMBER

31, 2006, WERE HIGHER WHEN COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2005, DUE TO THE

SIGNIFICANT PHARMACEUTICALS SALES PROCEEDS RECEIVED IN DECEMBER 2006. PRIMARY

SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARE PROVIDED THROUGH U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER AND EURO

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, OUTSTANDING TOTAL

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED TOTALED $1.349 BILLION AND AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY

$1.080 BILLION DURING 2006. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE SHELF BORROWING CAPACITY TOTALED

$1.038 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. CREDIT SUPPORT FOR OUTSTANDING

COMMERCIAL PAPER IS PROVIDED BY A $565 MILLION CREDIT AGREEMENT AMONG A GROUP

OF PRIMARY RELATIONSHIP BANKS. IN MARCH 2005, THE COMPANY REPLACED ITS 364-DAY

CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH SIMILAR TERMS. THIS

$565 MILLION CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES UP TO $115 MILLION IN LETTERS OF

CREDIT ($98 MILLION OF WHICH WAS UTILIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2006), WITH

PROVISIONS FOR INCREASING THIS LIMIT UP TO $150 MILLION.

COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES OF $55 MILLION

ARE IN PLACE ACROSS SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARY LOCATIONS ($9 MILLION OF

WHICH WAS UTILIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2006).

TO BENEFIT FROM THE SEC SECURITIES OFFERING

REFORM RULES APPLICABLE TO WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUERS, THE COMPANY FILED A SHELF

REGISTRATION STATEMENT ON FORM S-3 WITH THE SEC ON FEBRUARY 24, 2006, WHICH

BECAME EFFECTIVE AUTOMATICALLY, TO REGISTER AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF DEBT OR

EQUITY SECURITIES FOR FUTURE SALES. NO SECURITIES WERE ISSUED OFF THIS SHELF.

THE COMPANY INTENDS TO USE THE PROCEEDS FROM FUTURE SECURITIES SALES OFF THIS

SHELF FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT UNLIKELY THAT ITS ACCESS TO THE

COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET WILL BE RESTRICTED. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND

CERTAIN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY TO MEET

NEAR-TERM OBLIGATIONS, IF NECESSARY.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, CERTAIN DEBT AGREEMENTS ($350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE

SECURITIES AND $127 MILLION OF ESOP DEBT) HAD RATINGS TRIGGERS (BBB-/BAA3

OR LOWER) THAT WOULD REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF DEBT. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS

AA/AA1 DEBT RATINGS. IN ADDITION, THE $565 MILLION, FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT

REQUIRES 3M TO MAINTAIN A CAPITALIZATION RATIO AT NO MORE THAN 0.60 TO 1 AT THE

END OF EACH QUARTER. THIS RATIO IS CALCULATED AS FUNDED DEBT (INCLUDING ALL

BORROWED MONEY AND LETTERS OF CREDIT UTILIZED) TO THE SUM OF FUNDED DEBT AND

EQUITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THIS RATIO WAS APPROXIMATELY 0.27 TO 1.

3MS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 TOTALED $1.447 BILLION,

WITH AN ADDITIONAL $637 MILLION IN CURRENT AND LONG-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

3MS STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH SIGNIFICANT

FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES GOING FORWARD. THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ITS OPERATIONS TO DRIVE GROWTH, INCLUDING

CONTINUAL REVIEW OF ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES. 3M PAID DIVIDENDS OF $1.376

BILLION IN 2006, AND HAS A LONG HISTORY OF DIVIDEND INCREASES. IN FEBRUARY

2007, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON 3M COMMON

STOCK BY 4.3% TO 48 CENTS PER SHARE, EQUIVALENT TO AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF $1.92

PER SHARE. IN FEBRUARY 2007, 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS ALSO AUTHORIZED

A

$7 BILLION TWO-YEAR SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION FOR THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY

12, 2007 TO FEBRUARY 28, 2009.

IN 2007, THE COMPANY

EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE AN AMOUNT IN THE RANGE OF $100 MILLION TO $400 MILLION TO

ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED

MINIMUM PENSION CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2007. THEREFORE,

THE AMOUNT OF THE ANTICIPATED DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION COULD VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE U.S.-PLANS FUNDING STATUS AS OF THE 2007

MEASUREMENT DATE AND THE ANTICIPATED TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE CONTRIBUTION.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET

ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAS NOT UTILIZED

SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES TO FACILITATE OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING

ARRANGEMENTS. 3MS ACCRUED PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITIES, RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET AS PART OF CURRENT AND LONG-TERM LIABILITIES ARE ESTIMATED AT

APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION. 3M DOES NOT CONSIDER THIS AMOUNT TO BE MATERIAL.

THE FAIR VALUE OF 3M GUARANTEES OF LOANS

WITH THIRD PARTIES AND OTHER GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.

31

IN ADDITION TO

GUARANTEES, 3M, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, PERIODICALLY ENTERS INTO

AGREEMENTS THAT REQUIRE 3M TO INDEMNIFY EITHER MAJOR CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS FOR

SPECIFIC RISKS, SUCH AS CLAIMS FOR INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF THE

USE OF 3M PRODUCTS OR THE NEGLIGENCE OF 3M PERSONNEL, OR CLAIMS ALLEGING THAT

3M PRODUCTS INFRINGE THIRD PARTY PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WHILE

3MS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS CANNOT BE

ESTIMATED, THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

$350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES (FINAL MATURITY 2010), $62

MILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES (FINAL MATURITY 2044) $42 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE

NOTES (FINAL MATURITY 2037), AND $29 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE NOTES (FINAL

MATURITY 2027). THESE SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS THE CURRENT PORTION OF

LONG-TERM DEBT AS THE RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS.

UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS ARE DEFINED AS AN AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES THAT IS

ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING ON THE COMPANY. INCLUDED IN THE UNCONDITIONAL

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS CATEGORY ABOVE ARE CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO TAKE OR

PAY CONTRACTS, CAPITAL COMMITMENTS, SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND UTILITIES. THESE

ESTIMATES INCLUDE BOTH UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH TERMS IN EXCESS

OF ONE YEAR AND NORMAL ONGOING PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH TERMS OF LESS THAN ONE

YEAR. MANY OF THESE COMMITMENTS RELATE TO TAKE OR PAY CONTRACTS, IN WHICH 3M

GUARANTEES PAYMENT TO ENSURE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT ARE SOLD

TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE CONSIDERATION (PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES) FOR THESE UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS. THE PURCHASE OBLIGATION

AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE ENTIRE ANTICIPATED PURCHASES IN THE FUTURE, BUT

REPRESENT ONLY THOSE ITEMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED.

THE MAJORITY OF 3MS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PURCHASED AS NEEDED, WITH NO

UNCONDITIONAL COMMITMENT. FOR THIS REASON, THESE AMOUNTS WILL NOT PROVIDE A

RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH OUTFLOWS ON A

STAND-ALONE BASIS.

AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED MINIMUM PENSION

CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2007. THUS, COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS

TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LARGELY

DISCRETIONARY IN 2007 AND FUTURE YEARS. CONTRACTUAL CAPITAL COMMITMENTS ARE

ALSO INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE, BUT THESE COMMITMENTS REPRESENT A SMALL

PART OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED CAPITAL SPENDING IN 2007 AND BEYOND.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL DERIVATIVE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE, INTEREST RATE

RISKS AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS. A FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE,

COMPOSED OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT, PROVIDES OVERSIGHT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT AND

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES. THIS COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RISK

POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES, AND PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT

UTILIZATION. THIS COMMITTEE ALSO ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES FOR CONTROL AND

VALUATION, RISK ANALYSIS, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL, AND ONGOING MONITORING

AND REPORTING.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND

SWAPS TO HEDGE AGAINST THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS

DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY MANAGES INTEREST RATE RISKS USING A MIX OF FIXED AND

FLOATING RATE DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE BORROWING COSTS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO

INTEREST RATE SWAPS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY AGREES TO EXCHANGE,

AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND FLOATING INTEREST

AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AN AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT.

THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS,

PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

32

A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO TEST THE COMPANYS

EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES AND ASSESS THE RISK OF LOSS

OR BENEFIT IN AFTER-TAX EARNINGS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVES AND

UNDERLYING EXPOSURES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE MODEL (THIRD-PARTY

BANK DATASET) USED A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL OVER A 12-MONTH TIME HORIZON. THE

MODEL USED ANALYZED SEVENTEEN CURRENCIES, INTEREST RATES RELATED TO THREE

CURRENCIES, AND FIVE COMMODITIES, BUT DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT WHAT

ACTUALLY WILL BE EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY. THIS MODEL DOES NOT INCLUDE

CERTAIN HEDGE TRANSACTIONS, BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THEIR INCLUSION WOULD

NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESULTS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE POSSIBLE

ADVERSE AND POSITIVE IMPACTS TO AFTER-TAX EARNINGS RELATED TO THESE EXPOSURES.

CONCERNING INTEREST RATES, THE LARGER EFFECT ON EARNINGS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006

IS DUE TO THE COMPANYS INCREASED FLOATING INTEREST RATE EXPOSURE.

THE GLOBAL EXPOSURES

RELATED TO PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS ARE SUCH THAT A 1% PRICE CHANGE

WOULD RESULT IN A PRE-TAX COST OR SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION PER

YEAR. THE GLOBAL ENERGY EXPOSURE IS SUCH THAT A 10% PRICE CHANGE WOULD RESULT

IN A PRE-TAX COST OR SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $35 MILLION PER YEAR. DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE USED TO HEDGE LESS THAN 2% OF THE PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND

MATERIALS EXPOSURE AND ARE USED TO HEDGE APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THIS ENERGY

EXPOSURE.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

IN

THE CONTEXT OF ITEM 7A, MARKET RISK REFERS TO THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM

ADVERSE CHANGES IN FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT MARKET RATES AND PRICES,

SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE

COMPANY DISCUSSES RISK MANAGEMENT IN VARIOUS PLACES THROUGHOUT THIS DOCUMENT,

INCLUDING DISCUSSIONS IN ITEM 7 CONCERNING FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY,

AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS (LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, DERIVATIVES AND OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND THE DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES ACCOUNTING

POLICY). ALL DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY IS GOVERNED BY WRITTEN POLICIES, AND A

VALUE-AT-RISK ANALYSIS IS PROVIDED FOR THESE DERIVATIVES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

HAVE LEVERAGED DERIVATIVE POSITIONS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DOES HAVE

CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT THAT, IF CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, IS CONVERTIBLE

INTO SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK (REFER TO NOTE 10 IN THIS DOCUMENT).

WE HAVE COMPLETED

INTEGRATED AUDITS OF 3M COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF ITS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD

(UNITED STATES). OUR OPINIONS, BASED ON OUR AUDITS, ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

(THE COMPANY) AT DECEMBER 31,

2006 AND 2005, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR

EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006

IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED

IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  THESE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF THESE

STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM

THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES

EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH

IT ACCOUNTS FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS IN 2005, THE MANNER IN

WHICH IT ACCOUNTS FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IN 2006, AND THE MANNER IN WHICH

IT ACCOUNTS FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS OF

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR

OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX, THAT THE COMPANY

MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2006 BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL -

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO), IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA. FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE

COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COSO.

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS

OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED

STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING

AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND

PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION

OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE

MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE

BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING

PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION

OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT

LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO

FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE

BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE

POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION.

3M IS A DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL MANUFACTURER,

TECHNOLOGY INNOVATOR AND MARKETER OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS. ALL

SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY

TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERM 3M OR COMPANY REFERS

TO 3M COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

LOCAL CURRENCIES GENERALLY ARE CONSIDERED THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR OPERATIONS IN

LOCAL-CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS ARE TRANSLATED AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES. INCOME

AND EXPENSE ITEMS ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING

THE YEAR. CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

RECLASSIFICATIONS.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN THE

PRIOR YEARS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE

BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO

CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION. E

FFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2006, 3M ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123

(REVISED 2004), SHARE-BASED PAYMENT (SFAS NO. 123R), WHICH REQUIRES 3M TO

EXPENSE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION. THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123R USING

THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, ALL PRIOR PERIODS

WERE REVISED TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE FAIR-VALUE-BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR

AWARDS GRANTED IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 1995.

USE OF ESTIMATES.

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE

REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH AND TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS

WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS WHEN PURCHASED.

INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE

POLICIES, REAL ESTATE NOT USED IN THE BUSINESS, VENTURE CAPITAL AND EQUITY-METHOD

INVESTMENTS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

INVENTORIES.

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, WITH COST GENERALLY

DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS.

PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED INTEREST AND INTERNAL

ENGINEERING COSTS, ARE RECORDED AT COST. DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT GENERALLY IS COMPUTED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD BASED ON THE

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF BUILDINGS

AND IMPROVEMENTS PRIMARILY RANGE FROM 10 TO 40 YEARS, WITH THE MAJORITY IN THE

RANGE OF 20 TO 40 YEARS. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT

PRIMARILY RANGE FROM THREE TO 15 YEARS, WITH THE MAJORITY IN THE RANGE OF FIVE

TO 10 YEARS. FULLY DEPRECIATED ASSETS ARE RETAINED IN PROPERTY AND ACCUMULATED

DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTS UNTIL DISPOSAL. UPON DISPOSAL, ASSETS AND RELATED

ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNTS AND THE NET AMOUNT, LESS

PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSAL, IS CHARGED OR CREDITED TO OPERATIONS. PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT AMOUNTS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET (ASSET GROUP) MAY

NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED

TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION. THE AMOUNT OF

THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECORDED IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS

CARRYING VALUE OVER ITS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.

GOODWILL.

GOODWILL IS THE EXCESS OF COST OF AN

ACQUIRED ENTITY OVER THE AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES

ASSUMED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED. GOODWILL IS

TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, AND WILL BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN

ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THE

CARRYING AMOUNT MAY BE IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR GOODWILL IS DONE AT A

REPORTING UNIT LEVEL. REPORTING UNITS ARE ONE LEVEL BELOW THE BUSINESS SEGMENT

LEVEL, BUT CAN BE COMBINED WHEN REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE SAME SEGMENT HAVE

SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. THE MAJORITY OF GOODWILL RELATES TO AND IS

ASSIGNED DIRECTLY TO SPECIFIC REPORTING UNITS. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS GENERALLY

WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNITS NET ASSETS

EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED USING EARNINGS FOR THE REPORTING UNIT

MULTIPLIED BY A PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO FOR COMPARABLE INDUSTRY GROUPS, OR BY

USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006 AND DETERMINED THAT NO

GOODWILL WAS IMPAIRED.

41

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

INTANGIBLE

ASSETS INCLUDE PATENTS, TRADENAMES AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM AN

INDEPENDENT PARTY. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE, NAMELY CERTAIN

TRADENAMES, ARE NOT AMORTIZED. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE ARE

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, WITH ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM ONE

TO 20 YEARS. INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT

ANNUALLY, AND WILL BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT

OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY

BE IMPAIRED. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT

WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET

(ASSET GROUP) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USED

IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS

TO BE RECORDED IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUE OVER

ITS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

ANALYSIS. COSTS RELATED TO INTERNALLY DEVELOPED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS

PATENTS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED, PRIMARILY IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND

RELATED EXPENSES.

REVENUE (SALES) RECOGNITION.

THE COMPANY SELLS A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSIFIED BASE OF

CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD AND HAS NO MATERIAL CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK.

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE

RISKS

AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE SUBSTANTIVELY TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS. THIS

CONDITION NORMALLY IS MET WHEN THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN DELIVERED OR UPON

PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES.

THE COMPANY

RECORDS ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR CUSTOMER AND DISTRIBUTOR

INCENTIVES, SUCH AS REBATES, AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS

ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TREND ANALYSIS AND

PROJECTED MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS SERVED. SALES, USE,

VALUE-ADDED AND OTHER EXCISE TAXES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN REVENUE.

THE MAJORITY OF 3MS SALES AGREEMENTS ARE FOR STANDARD PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES WITH CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OCCURRING UPON DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCT OR

PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE. 3M ALSO ENTERS INTO AGREEMENTS THAT CONTAIN

MULTIPLE ELEMENTS (SUCH AS EQUIPMENT, INSTALLATION AND SERVICE) OR NON-STANDARD

TERMS AND CONDITIONS. FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, 3M RECOGNIZES REVENUE

FOR DELIVERED ELEMENTS WHEN IT HAS STAND-ALONE VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER, THE FAIR

VALUES OF UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS ARE KNOWN, CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF THE DELIVERED

ELEMENTS HAS OCCURRED, AND THERE ARE ONLY CUSTOMARY REFUND OR RETURN RIGHTS

RELATED TO THE DELIVERED ELEMENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE PRECEDING CONDITIONS,

EQUIPMENT REVENUE

IS NOT RECORDED UNTIL THE INSTALLATION HAS BEEN

COMPLETED IF EQUIPMENT ACCEPTANCE IS DEPENDENT UPON INSTALLATION, OR IF

INSTALLATION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE EQUIPMENT. INSTALLATION

REVENUES ARE NOT RECORDED UNTIL INSTALLATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED. FOR PREPAID

SERVICE CONTRACTS, SALES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER

THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT, UNLESS HISTORICAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THE COSTS ARE

INCURRED ON OTHER THAN A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. LICENSE FEE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED

AS EARNED, AND NO REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED UNTIL THE INCEPTION OF THE LICENSE

TERM.

ON OCCASION, AGREEMENTS WILL CONTAIN

MILESTONES, OR 3M WILL RECOGNIZE REVENUE BASED ON PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE. FOR

THESE AGREEMENTS, AND DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFICS, 3M MAY RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON

COMPLETION OF A SUBSTANTIVE MILESTONE, OR IN PROPORTION TO COSTS INCURRED TO

DATE COMPARED WITH THE ESTIMATE OF TOTAL COSTS TO BE INCURRED.

ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCES.

TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE

RECORDED AT THE INVOICED AMOUNT AND DO NOT BEAR INTEREST. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS

ALLOWANCES FOR BAD DEBTS, CASH DISCOUNTS, PRODUCT RETURNS AND VARIOUS OTHER

ITEMS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND PRODUCT RETURNS IS BASED ON THE

BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES IN EXISTING ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AND ANTICIPATED SALES RETURNS. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ALLOWANCES

BASED ON HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE BY INDUSTRY AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC DATA

AND HISTORICAL SALES RETURNS. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL

ACCOUNTS MONTHLY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE-SHEET CREDIT

EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

ADVERTISING AND MERCHANDISING.

THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS IN THE YEAR INCURRED, AND TOTALED

$471 MILLION IN 2006, $457 MILLION IN 2005 AND $433 MILLION IN 2004.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS IN THE YEAR

INCURRED AND ARE SHOWN ON A SEPARATE LINE OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME. THIS AMOUNT INCLUDED A $95 MILLION IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

CHARGE (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2) AND $75 MILLION IN 2006 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

(NOTE 4). RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, COVERING BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

AND THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND

IMPROVED PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, TOTALED $943 MILLION IN 2006, $818 MILLION IN

2005 AND $792 MILLION IN 2004. THE 2006 AMOUNT INCLUDES THE $95 MILLION FOR

PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DISCUSSED ABOVE. RELATED EXPENSES

PRIMARILY INCLUDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT PROVIDED BY 3M TO CUSTOMERS WHO ARE USING

EXISTING 3M PRODUCTS, AND INTERNALLY DEVELOPED PATENT COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE

COSTS

AND FEES INCURRED TO PREPARE, FILE, SECURE AND MAINTAIN PATENTS.

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE.

THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES DIRECT COSTS OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES USED IN

THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE. AMOUNTS CAPITALIZED ARE AMORTIZED ON

A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A PERIOD OF THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND ARE REPORTED AS

A COMPONENT OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT WITHIN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

ENVIRONMENTAL.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXISTING

CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR

FUTURE REVENUES ARE EXPENSED. RESERVES FOR LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED

REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED ON AN

42

UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE

PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF

FEASIBILITY STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION.

ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE

OPERATIONS GENERALLY ARE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES.

INCOME TAXES.

THE

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY

APPROACH. UNDER THIS APPROACH, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES REPRESENT THE EXPECTED

FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS

AND TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION

ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THEIR

RELIABILITY EXISTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, NO VALUATION ALLOWANCES WERE

RECORDED.

EARNINGS

PER SHARE.

THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE

SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR CALCULATING BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DILUTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION PLANS. CERTAIN MANAGEMENT STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM AVERAGE OPTIONS

OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEARS 2006, 2005 AND 2004 WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE

COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A

DILUTIVE EFFECT (31.5 MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR 2006, 15.4 MILLION AVERAGE

OPTIONS FOR 2005, AND 6.6 MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR 2004). AS DISCUSSED IN

NOTE 10, T

HE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION RELATED

TO THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES HAVE NEVER BEEN MET; ACCORDINGLY, THERE WAS

NO IMPACT ON 3MS DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE. IF THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION

ARE MET, 3M MAY CHOOSE TO PAY IN CASH AND/OR COMMON STOCK

; HOWEVER,

IF THIS OCCURS, THE COMPANY HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO SETTLE THIS DEBT

SECURITY IN CASH. THE COMPUTATIONS FOR

BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31 FOLLOW.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED SFAS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004).

SFAS NO. 123R SUPERSEDES APB OPINION NO. 25. UNDER APB OPINION NO. 25, NO

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION GRANTS IF THE

EXERCISE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTION GRANTS IS AT OR ABOVE THE FAIR

MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. UNDER SFAS NO. 123R,

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED FOR BOTH THE GENERAL EMPLOYEES STOCK

PURCHASE PLAN (GESPP) AND THE MANAGEMENT STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (MSOP). SFAS NO.

123R REQUIRES THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION AT THE GRANT DATE AND THE RECOGNITION OF THE RELATED EXPENSE OVER

THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION VESTS. THE COMPANY ADOPTED

SFAS NO. 123R EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006. THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123R

USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. ALL PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RESTATED

TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE FAIR-VALUE-BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR AWARDS GRANTED

IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 1995. THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THAT THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF THIS STANDARD ACHIEVES THE

HIGHEST LEVEL OF CLARITY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG THE PRESENTED PERIODS. ON

NOVEMBER 10, 2005, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION NO. FAS

123(R)-3,TRANSITION ELECTION RELATED TO ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED

PAYMENT AWARDS (THE FSP). THE FSP PROVIDES THAT COMPANIES MAY ELECT TO USE A

SPECIFIED SHORT-CUT METHOD TO CALCULATE THE HISTORICAL POOL OF WINDFALL TAX

BENEFITS UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R. THE COMPANY ELECTED TO USE THE SHORT-CUT

METHOD WHEN IT ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123R ON JANUARY 1, 2006.

THE COMPANY ISSUES MSOP

OPTIONS TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES ANNUALLY IN MAY USING THE AVERAGE STOCK PRICE ON

THE GRANT DATE, WHICH IS THE DATE OF THE ANNUAL STOCKHOLDERS MEETING. IN MAY

2005, SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED 36.75 MILLION SHARES

43

FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE

MSOP IN THE FORM OF MANAGEMENT STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. UNDER THE PLAN, THE COMPANY HAS

PRINCIPALLY ISSUED STOCK OPTIONS TO MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES THAT ARE GRANTED AT

MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT. IN ADDITION TO GRANTS TO MANAGEMENT

EMPLOYEES, THE COMPANY MAKES OTHER MINOR STOCK OPTION GRANTS TO EMPLOYEES, FOR

WHICH VESTING TERMS AND OPTION LIVES ARE NOT SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT, AND ALSO

MAKES MINOR GRANTS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED GRANTS.

REFER TO NOTE 16 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE MSOP.

IN MAY 1997, SHAREHOLDERS

APPROVED 30 MILLION SHARES FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE COMPANYS GESPP. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR GESSP OPTIONS OF $19 MILLION IN 2006, $19 MILLION IN

2005, AND $21 MILLION IN 2004. REFER TO NOTE 15 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

CONCERNING THE GESPP.

THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING

SFAS NO. 123R ON THE COMPANYS NET INCOME IS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRO FORMA

DISCLOSURES PROVIDED IN PREVIOUS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY

THE IMPACT OF STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE PROVIDED BELOW FOR THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, WAS RECOGNIZED OVER THE NOMINAL VESTING

PERIOD, WHEREBY IF AN EMPLOYEE RETIRED BEFORE THE END OF THE VESTING PERIOD,

THE COMPANY WOULD RECOGNIZE ANY REMAINING UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST AT THE

DATE OF RETIREMENT. SFAS NO. 123R REQUIRES RECOGNITION UNDER A NON-SUBSTANTIVE

VESTING PERIOD APPROACH, REQUIRING COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNITION WHEN AN

EMPLOYEE IS ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE. 3M EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED STATES ARE ELIGIBLE

TO RETIRE BEGINNING AT AGE 55 AND AFTER HAVING COMPLETED FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE.

APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE NUMBER OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS ARE MADE TO

THIS POPULATION. THE COMPANY CHANGED TO THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING PERIOD

APPROACH FOR NEW STOCK COMPENSATION GRANTS MADE AFTER THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO. 123R ON JANUARY 1, 2006. THEREFORE, PRIMARILY BEGINNING IN MAY 2006

WITH THE ANNUAL MSOP GRANT, IMMEDIATE EXPENSING OF THOSE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE RESULTED IN HIGHER COMPENSATION

EXPENSE THAN HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED IN COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIODS. EFFECTIVE

WITH THE MAY 2005 ANNUAL MSOP GRANT, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS VESTING PERIOD

FROM ONE TO THREE YEARS, WHICH RESULTS IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE UNDER THE MAY

2005 ANNUAL GRANT BEING RECOGNIZED OVER THREE YEARS. THE DECREASE IN

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FOR 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY

THIS CHANGE IN VESTING PERIOD. CAPITALIZED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AMOUNTS

WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR 2006, 2005 AND 2004. THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

IMPACT PRESENTED BELOW FOR 2005 AND 2004 IS COMPUTED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

RESTATED HISTORICAL PER SHARE AMOUNTS (WHICH REFLECT THE IMPACT OF SFAS NO.

123R ON BOTH NET INCOME AND DILUTED SHARES) COMPARED TO THE HISTORICALLY

REPORTED DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE. AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS (MSOP AND

GESPP) ARE AS FOLLOWS.

HISTORICALLY MADE ADEQUATE DISCRETIONARY PURCHASES, BASED ON CASH AVAILABILITY,

MARKET TRENDS AND OTHER FACTORS, TO SATISFY STOCK OPTION EXERCISE ACTIVITY.

OMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS,

AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY MARKET VOLATILITY. ALL

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE DESIGNATED AND

EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. IF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION CEASES TO EXIST, ALL CHANGES

IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED ARE

RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. INSTRUMENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE

ACCOUNTING ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH CHANGES RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING

PURPOSES AND IS NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES.

HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY DOES HAVE CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT THAT, IF CONDITIONS FOR

CONVERSION ARE MET, IS CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK (REFER TO

NOTE 10 IN THIS DOCUMENT).

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS

ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN

AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R). REFER TO NOTE 11 FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS STANDARD.

IN JUNE 2006, THE FASB

ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 48 (FIN 48), ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME

TAXES, AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109. REFER TO NOTE 8 FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS STANDARD.

IN FEBRUARY 2006, THE

FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 155, HYBRID INSTRUMENTS.

SFAS NO. 155 AMENDS SFAS NO. 133 AND SFAS NO. 140, ACCOUNTING FOR

TRANSFERS AND SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND EXTINGUISHMENTS OF LIABILITIES.

SFAS NO. 155 ALSO RESOLVES ISSUES ADDRESSED IN STATEMENT 133 IMPLEMENTATION

ISSUE NO. D1, APPLICATION OF STATEMENT 133 TO BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN

SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS. SFAS NO. 155: A) PERMITS FAIR VALUE

REMEASUREMENT FOR ANY HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT CONTAINS AN EMBEDDED

DERIVATIVE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD REQUIRE BIFURCATION, B) CLARIFIES WHICH

INTEREST-ONLY STRIPS AND PRINCIPAL-ONLY STRIPS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE

REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS NO. 133, C) ESTABLISHES A REQUIREMENT TO EVALUATE

INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS TO IDENTIFY INTERESTS THAT ARE

FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES OR THAT ARE HYBRID FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT CONTAIN

AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE REQUIRING BIFURCATION, D) CLARIFIES THAT CONCENTRATIONS

OF CREDIT RISK IN THE FORM OF SUBORDINATION ARE NOT EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, AND

E) AMENDS SFAS NO. 140 TO ELIMINATE THE PROHIBITION ON A QUALIFYING SPECIAL

PURPOSE ENTITY FROM HOLDING A DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT PERTAINS TO

A BENEFICIAL INTEREST OTHER THAN ANOTHER DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. SFAS

NO. 155 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ACQUIRED OR ISSUED AFTER THE

BEGINNING OF AN ENTITYS FIRST FISCAL YEAR THAT BEGINS AFTER SEPTEMBER 15, 2006

(JANUARY 1, 2007 FOR 3M). THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF

THIS STANDARD, BUT WOULD NOT EXPECT SFAS NO. 155 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE

FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. SFAS NO. 157 ESTABLISHES A

SINGLE DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE AND A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, SETS

OUT A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY TO BE USED TO CLASSIFY THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION

USED IN FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, AND REQUIRES NEW DISCLOSURES OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON THEIR LEVEL IN THE HIERARCHY. SFAS

NO. 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007

(JANUARY 1, 2008 FOR 3M) AND IS TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY IS

CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACTS AND DISCLOSURES OF THIS STANDARD, BUT WOULD

NOT EXPECT SFAS NO. 157 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 47, ACCOUNTING FOR

CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FIN 47). THIS ACCOUNTING

STANDARD APPLIES TO THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND

WHERE THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS EXIST FOR CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUE

OF THESE OBLIGATIONS IS RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS. OVER

TIME THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE AND THE

INITIAL CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE USEFUL LIVES OF THE RELATED

ASSETS. THE ADOPTION OF FIN 47 EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2005, RESULTED IN THE

RECOGNITION OF AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION LIABILITY OF $59 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $35 MILLION FOR 2005, WHICH IS

REFLECTED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE PRO FORMA EFFECT OF APPLYING THIS

GUIDANCE IN ALL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED WAS DETERMINED NOT TO BE MATERIAL. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION LIABILITY WAS $57 MILLION.

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE

FASBS EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE FINALIZED EITF ISSUE NO. 04-08, THE EFFECT

OF CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT ON DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE THAT WOULD

REQUIRE THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF SHARES FROM CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT TO BE

INCLUDED IN THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

THE CONTINGENCY HAS BEEN MET. THE COMPANY HAS $616 MILLION IN AGGREGATE FACE

AMOUNT OF 30-YEAR ZERO COUPON SENIOR NOTES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO

APPROXIMATELY 5.8 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET.

THESE CONDITIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN MET (SEE NOTE 10). IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE FASB

REVISED ITS DECEMBER 2003 EXPOSURE DRAFT SFAS NO. 128R, 

EARNINGS PER SHARE  AN AMENDMENT OF FASB

STATEMENT NO. 128, ANTICIPATED TO BE EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL PERIODS

ENDING AFTER JUNE 15, 2006. THE PROPOSED SFAS NO. 128R FURTHER ADDRESSES

CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE

46

DEBT AND SEVERAL OTHER

ISSUES. UNLESS THE COMPANY TAKES STEPS TO MODIFY CERTAIN TERMS OF THIS DEBT

SECURITY, EITF ISSUE NO. 04-08 AND PROPOSED SFAS NO. 128R (WHEN EFFECTIVE)

WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 5.8 MILLION SHARES TO DILUTED

SHARES OUTSTANDING TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE CONTINGENT ISSUANCE OF SHARES. ALSO,

USING THE IF-CONVERTED METHOD, NET INCOME FOR THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

CALCULATIONS WOULD BE ADJUSTED FOR INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DEBT

INSTRUMENT. EITF ISSUE NO. 04-08 WOULD HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE BEGINNING WITH

THE COMPANYS 2004 FOURTH QUARTER. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE FASBS DELAY IN ISSUING

SFAS NO. 128R AND THE COMPANYS INTENT AND ABILITY TO SETTLE THIS DEBT SECURITY

IN CASH VERSUS THE ISSUANCE OF STOCK, THE IMPACT OF THE ADDITIONAL DILUTED

SHARES WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION UNTIL

THE PROPOSED SFAS NO. 128R IS EFFECTIVE. WHEN SFAS NO. 128R IS EFFECTIVE, PRIOR

PERIODS DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AMOUNTS WILL

BE RESTATED TO PRESENT COMPARABLE INFORMATION. THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL REDUCTION

IN THE COMPANYS DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $.02

TO $.04 PER SHARE FOR EACH OF THE TOTAL YEARS 2006, 2005 AND 2004. BECAUSE THE

IMPACT OF THIS STANDARD IS ONGOING, THE COMPANYS DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING

AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AMOUNTS WOULD BE IMPACTED UNTIL RETIREMENT OR

MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN TERMS OF THIS DEBT SECURITY.

NOTE 2.  ACQUISITIONS AND

DIVESTITURES

DIVESTITURES.

IN DECEMBER 2006,

3M COMPLETED THE SALE OF ITS GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IN THE

UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND LATIN AMERICA REGION AND THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION,

INCLUDING AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH AFRICA. 3M RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $1.209 BILLION

FOR THIS TRANSACTION AND RECOGNIZED, NET OF ASSETS SOLD, A PRE-TAX GAIN OF

$1.074 BILLION (RECORDED IN HEALTH CARE BUSINESS). BUYER AND SALE PRICE

INFORMATION BY REGION IS AS FOLLOWS.

·

GRACEWAY

PHARMACEUTICALS INC. ACQUIRED 3MS PHARMACEUTICAL OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES, CANADA, AND LATIN AMERICA FOR $860 MILLION.

·

IRONBRIDGE

CAPITAL AND ARCHER CAPITAL ACQUIRED 3MS PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IN THE ASIA

PACIFIC REGION, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA AND SOUTH AFRICA FOR $349 MILLION.

·

MEDA

AB ACQUIRED 3MS PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IN EUROPE FOR $817 MILLION IN JANUARY

2007, WHICH IS NOT INCLUDED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR 2006 (REFER TO

SUBSEQUENT EVENT DISCUSSION BELOW).

THE AGREEMENTS ARE

THE RESULT OF A REVIEW OF STRATEGIC OPTIONS FOR THE BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS AND ITS IMMUNE RESPONSE MODIFIER (IRM) PLATFORM THAT 3M ANNOUNCED IN

APRIL 2006. UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, THE PURCHASERS ACQUIRED REGIONAL MARKETING

AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS FOR 3MS WELL-KNOWN BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS,

INCLUDING ALDARA, DIFFLAM, DUROMINE, TAMBOCOR, MAXAIR, METROGEL-VAGINAL AND

MINITRAN. AS PART OF THE TRANSACTION, GRACEWAY PHARMACEUTICALS ALSO ACQUIRED

THE RIGHTS TO CERTAIN IRM MOLECULES.

IN CONNECTION WITH

THESE TRANSACTIONS, 3M ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WHEREBY ITS DRUG DELIVERY

SYSTEMS DIVISION BECAME A SOURCE OF SUPPLY TO THE ACQUIRING COMPANIES. BECAUSE

OF THE EXTENT OF 3M CASH FLOWS FROM THESE AGREEMENTS IN RELATION TO THOSE OF

THE DISPOSED-OF BUSINESSES, THE OPERATIONS OF THE BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 4 FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF THE 2006 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS THAT RESULTED FROM THE DIVESTURE OF

THE COMPANYS GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS.

SUBSEQUENT

EVENT.

AS DISCUSSED

ABOVE, IN JANUARY 2007, 3M COMPLETED THE SALE OF ITS GLOBAL BRANDED

PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IN EUROPE TO MEDA AB FOR $817 MILLION. THE GAIN ON

SALE, NET OF OTHER ANTICIPATED RESTRUCTURING COSTS, IS ESTIMATED AT $0.60 TO

$0.70 PER DILUTED SHARE. HELD-FOR-SALE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RELATED TO THIS

TRANSACTION ARE NOT MATERIAL. THIS TRANSACTION WILL BE REFLECTED IN 3MS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD ENDING MARCH 31, 2007.

ACQUISITIONS.

DURING THE 12

MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 3M COMPLETED 19 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS FOR A

TOTAL PURCHASE PRICE OF $888 MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED. PURCHASED

IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $282 MILLION FOR THESE ACQUISITIONS WILL BE

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER LIVES RANGING FROM 1 TO 17 YEARS

(WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIFE OF 9 YEARS). THE PURCHASE PRICE OF SEVERAL OF THESE

ACQUISITIONS IS SUBJECT TO INCREASES, WHICH COULD BE TRIGGERED BY THE

ACHIEVEMENT OF CERTAIN MILESTONES.

THE LARGEST OF THESE

ACQUISITIONS WAS THE AUGUST 2006 PURCHASE OF 100 PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING

SHARES OF SECURITY PRINTING AND SYSTEMS LIMITED (SAFETY, SECURITY AND

PROTECTION SERVICES BUSINESS) FROM AUTHENTOS GMBH, GERMANY. THE ACQUIRED

COMPANY IS A PRODUCER OF FINISHED, PERSONALIZED PASSPORTS AND SECURE CARDS. THE

PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION IS CONSIDERED PRELIMINARY.

IN OCTOBER 2006, 3M

(HEALTH CARE BUSINESS) PURCHASED 100 PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF

MATERIAL.

IN CONNECTION WITH THIS TARGETED RESTRUCTURING PLAN, THE COMPANY

FUNCTIONS WITHIN THE COMPANY. APPROXIMATELY 480 POSITIONS WERE PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS EMPLOYEES, APPROXIMATELY 980 POSITIONS RELATED TO OVERHEAD REDUCTION,

PRIMARILY IN WORLDWIDE STAFF OVERHEAD, AND APPROXIMATELY 490 POSITIONS WERE

BUSINESS-SPECIFIC REDUCTION ACTIONS. OF THE 1,950 EMPLOYMENT REDUCTIONS, ABOUT

55% ARE IN THE UNITED STATES, 21% IN EUROPE, 16% IN LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA,

AND 8% IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA.

EMPLOYEE-RELATED SEVERANCE CHARGES ARE LARGELY BASED UPON DISTRIBUTED

EMPLOYMENT POLICIES AND SUBSTANTIVE SEVERANCE PLANS AND WERE REFLECTED IN THE

QUARTER IN WHICH MANAGEMENT APPROVED THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS. SEVERANCE

AMOUNTS FOR WHICH AFFECTED EMPLOYEES WERE REQUIRED TO RENDER SERVICE IN ORDER

TO RECEIVE BENEFITS AT THEIR TERMINATION DATES WERE MEASURED AT THE DATE SUCH

BENEFITS WERE COMMUNICATED TO THE APPLICABLE EMPLOYEES AND RECOGNIZED AS

EXPENSE OVER THE EMPLOYEES REMAINING SERVICE PERIODS.

NON-CASH CHARGES IN 2006 INCLUDE EMPLOYEE-RELATED CHARGES OF

APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION RELATED TO SPECIAL TERMINATION PENSION AND MEDICAL

BENEFITS GRANTED TO CERTAIN U.S. ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. THESE ADDITIONAL PENSION

AND MEDICAL BENEFITS WERE REFLECTED AS A COMPONENT OF THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF

THE COMPANYS PENSION AND MEDICAL PLANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. IN ADDITION,

TERMINATE A CONTRACT BEFORE THE END OF ITS TERM (MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AT THE

CONTINUE TO BE INCURRED UNDER THE CONTRACT FOR ITS REMAINING TERM WITHOUT

ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO THE COMPANY.

ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2006 ASSOCIATED WITH THE PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS AND BUSINESS-SPECIFIC ACTIONS INCLUDE $109 MILLION RELATIVE TO

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT; $30 MILLION RELATIVE TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS; AND

$5 MILLION RELATIVE TO OTHER ASSETS. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATIVE TO INTANGIBLE

ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT REFLECT THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS

CARRYING VALUES OVER THEIR FAIR VALUES AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1. THE

PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE FOR CERTAIN ASSETS NOT

TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYERS AND PRIMARILY RELATE TO THE WRITE-DOWN OF THE ASSETS

TO SALVAGE VALUE. THE BUSINESS-SPECIFIC ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES PRIMARILY

RELATE TO DECISIONS THE COMPANY MADE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006 TO EXIT

CERTAIN MARGINAL PRODUCT LINES IN THE DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT AND ELECTRO

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87,

88, 106 AND 132(R). THIS STANDARD ELIMINATED THE REQUIREMENT FOR A MINIMUM

PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED UNDER SFAS NO. 87.

THIS STANDARD REQUIRED EMPLOYERS TO RECOGNIZE THE UNDERFUNDED OR OVERFUNDED

STATUS OF A DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN ITS STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL POSITION. AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SFAS NO. 158, THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN AFTER-TAX DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME OF $1.187 BILLION AND $513 MILLION FOR THE

55

U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL PENSION BENEFIT PLANS, RESPECTIVELY, AND $218 MILLION FOR THE

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PLAN. SEE NOTE 11 FOR

ADDITIONAL DETAIL.

PRIOR TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SFAS NO. 158, A MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY

ADJUSTMENT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED ANNUALLY IF THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION

(ABO) EXCEEDED THE FAIR VALUE OF PENSION ASSETS, WHICH WOULD RESULT IN THE

EMPLOYER RECOGNIZING A LIABILITY THAT IS AT LEAST EQUAL TO THE UNFUNDED ABO.

FOR

THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE CHANGE FROM A MINIMUM PENSION

LIABILITY WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO A PREPAID PENSION

ASSET INCREASED STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY BY $1.193 BILLION (AFTER-TAX). THIS

INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE ASSETS BEING IN EXCESS OF THE

ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR THE U.S. QUALIFIED PLAN, WHICH CAUSED THE

MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY RECORDED FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND

2002 TO BE REVERSED.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY WAS IN A PREPAID ASSET POSITION FOR ITS U.S.

QUALIFIED PLAN.

INCOME TAX EFFECTS FOR CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT

BECAUSE NO TAX PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS. RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE

TO AVOID DOUBLE COUNTING IN COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS THAT ARE ALSO RECORDED

AS PART OF NET INCOME. RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS (OTHER THAN FOR CASH FLOW

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS PROVIDED IN NOTE 12) WERE NOT MATERIAL.

THE COMPANY IS

ROUTINELY AUDITED BY TAX AUTHORITIES IN THE COUNTRIES WHERE IT CONDUCTS

BUSINESS AND MAINTAINS A TAX RESERVE THAT REFLECTS MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE

COMPANYS PROBABLE EXPOSURE ARISING FROM SUCH AUDITS. TO THE EXTENT THE COMPANY

WERE TO PREVAIL IN MATTERS FOR WHICH RESERVES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED OR BE

REQUIRED TO PAY AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF RESERVES, THE COMPANYS TAX PROVISION IN A

GIVEN FINANCIAL STATEMENT PERIOD MAY BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.

ANNUAL TAX PROVISIONS

INCLUDE AMOUNTS CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT TO PAY ASSESSMENTS THAT MAY RESULT FROM

EXAMINATION OF TAX RETURNS; HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT ULTIMATELY PAID UPON RESOLUTION

OF ISSUES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE AMOUNT ACCRUED.

IN 2006, AN AUDIT OF THE

COMPANYS U.S. TAX RETURNS FOR YEARS THROUGH 2001 WAS COMPLETED. THE COMPANY

AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE REACHED A FINAL SETTLEMENT FOR THESE YEARS,

INCLUDING AN AGREEMENT ON THE AMOUNT OF A REFUND CLAIM TO BE FILED BY THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY ALSO SUBSTANTIALLY RESOLVED AUDITS IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN

COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE PREPARATION AND FILING OF ITS

2005 U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN AND THE CORRESPONDING 2005 STATE INCOME TAX

RETURNS. THE ADJUSTMENTS FROM AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED IN THE U.S. FEDERAL

AND STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS (BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE) INCLUDED LOWER U.S.

TAXES ON DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM THE COMPANYS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE

COMPANY ALSO MADE QUARTERLY ADJUSTMENTS (BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE) TO ITS

RESERVES FOR TAX CONTINGENCIES. CONSIDERING THE DEVELOPMENTS NOTED ABOVE AND

OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT ON OPEN AUDIT YEARS OF THE RECENT

RESOLUTION OF ISSUES IN VARIOUS AUDITS, THESE REASSESSMENTS RESULTED IN A

REDUCTION OF THE RESERVES IN 2006 BY $149 MILLION, INCLUSIVE OF THE EXPECTED

AMOUNT OF CERTAIN REFUND CLAIMS.

IN 2005, THE

COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT TO REINVEST $1.7 BILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS IN

THE UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT

OF 2004. THIS ACT PROVIDED THE COMPANY THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAX-EFFICIENTLY

REPATRIATE FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR U.S. QUALIFYING INVESTMENTS SPECIFIED IN ITS

DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN. AS A CONSEQUENCE, IN 2005, 3M RECORDED A CHARGE OF

$75 MILLION.

THE COMPANY MADE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS

U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN OF $200 MILLION IN 2006, AND $500 MILLION IN 2005.

IN 2004, THE COMPANY MADE A SPECIAL PENSION CONTRIBUTION TO 3MS JAPANESE

PENSION PLAN OF $155 MILLION AND A DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION OF $300

MILLION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN.

THE CURRENT INCOME TAX PROVISION INCLUDES A BENEFIT

FOR THE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS; THE DEFERRED TAX PROVISION INCLUDES A COST FOR

THE RELATED TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS

ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED

57

BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN

AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R) IN 2006, AS DISCUSSED

IN NOTE 11. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN AFTER-TAX DECREASE IN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE CHANGE IN THE YEAR-END DEFERRED TAX

BALANCE INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF RECORDING THIS ADDITIONAL OBLIGATION IN ADDITION

TO THE ANNUAL PROVISION FOR DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

IN JUNE 2006, THE

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 48, (FIN 48),

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES, AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB

STATEMENT NO. 109. FIN 48 PRESCRIBES A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THRESHOLD FOR

FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR

EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THIS INTERPRETATION ALSO PROVIDES

GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION

OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR

INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME

TAXES IN INTERIM PERIODS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. THIS INTERPRETATION IS

EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007 AND THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS, IF ANY, OF APPLYING

THIS INTERPRETATION WILL BE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS

OF JANUARY 1, 2007. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF FIN 48 TO HAVE

A MATERIAL IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT COMMITMENTS

AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MADE BY 3M, INCOME FROM MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES IN

CERTAIN COUNTRIES IS SUBJECT TO REDUCED TAX RATES OR, IN SOME CASES, IS EXEMPT

FROM TAX FOR YEARS THROUGH 2014. THE INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

TAX STATUS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $20 MILLION (3 CENTS

PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2006, $23 MILLION (3 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN

2005, AND $32 MILLION (4 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2004.

THE COMPANY HAS

NOT PROVIDED DEFERRED TAXES ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO

INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE REINVESTED

INDEFINITELY. THESE EARNINGS RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS AND WERE

APPROXIMATELY $5 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. BECAUSE OF THE AVAILABILITY

OF U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX

LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE NOT INDEFINITELY

REINVESTED.

NOTE

9.  MARKETABLE SECURITIES

DURING 2006, THE COMPANY

INVESTED IN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND AUCTION RATE SECURITIES. THE FOLLOWING

IS A SUMMARY OF AMOUNTS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET FOR

MARKETABLE SECURITIES (CURRENT AND NON-CURRENT) AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. THE

COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY MARKETABLE SECURITIES BALANCE AT YEAR-END 2005.

CLASSIFICATION OF

MARKETABLE SECURITIES AS CURRENT OR NON-CURRENT IS DEPENDENT UPON MANAGEMENTS

INTENDED HOLDING PERIOD, THE SECURITYS MATURITY DATE, OR BOTH. IF MANAGEMENT

INTENDS TO HOLD THE SECURITIES FOR LONGER THAN ONE YEAR, THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS

NON-CURRENT. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES WERE NOT MATERIAL IN 2006. GROSS

REALIZED GAINS AND GROSS REALIZED LOSSES ON SALES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE

ALSO NOT MATERIAL. THERE WERE NO IMPAIRMENT LOSSES RECOGNIZED ON MARKETABLE

SECURITIES IN 2006. COST OF SECURITIES SOLD OR RECLASSIFIED USE THE SPECIFIC

IDENTIFICATION METHOD. SINCE THESE MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WILL FLOW THROUGH OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WITH AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

INTO EARNINGS UPON SALE. OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ACTIVITY FOR THESE

SECURITIES IN 2006 WAS NOT MATERIAL.

THE FAIR VALUE OF

SECURITIES IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 WAS $86 MILLION,

ALL OF WHICH HAVE BEEN IN A LOSS POSITION FOR LESS THAN 12 MONTHS. UNREALIZED

LOSSES FOR THESE SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 WERE NOT MATERIAL. 3M HAS BOTH

THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE SECURITIES FOR THE TIME NECESSARY TO RECOVER

THE COST BASIS.

(FINAL MATURITY 2044), $42 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE NOTES (FINAL MATURITY

FLOATING RATE NOTES ARE PRESENTED AS OTHER BORROWINGS IN THE PRECEDING

LONG-TERM DEBT TABLE. THESE SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF

LONG-TERM DEBT AS THE RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS.

THE

ESOP DEBT IS SERVICED BY DIVIDENDS ON STOCK HELD BY THE ESOP AND BY COMPANY

CONTRIBUTIONS. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT REPORTED AS INTEREST EXPENSE, BUT

ARE REPORTED AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME. OTHER BORROWINGS INCLUDES DEBT HELD BY 3MS INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES AND

FLOATING RATE NOTES IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH THE LONG-TERM PORTION OF THIS

DEBT PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF U.S. DOLLAR FLOATING RATE DEBT.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, CERTAIN DEBT AGREEMENTS ($350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE

SECURITIES AND $127 MILLION OF ESOP DEBT) HAD RATINGS TRIGGERS (BBB-/BAA3

OR LOWER) THAT WOULD REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF DEBT. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS

AA/AA1 DEBT RATINGS. IN ADDITION, A $565 MILLION, FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT

REQUIRES 3M TO MAINTAIN A CAPITALIZATION RATIO AT NO MORE THAN 0.60 TO 1 AT THE

END OF EACH QUARTER. THIS RATIO IS CALCULATED AS FUNDED DEBT (INCLUDING ALL

BORROWED MONEY AND LETTERS OF CREDIT UTILIZED) TO THE SUM OF FUNDED DEBT AND

EQUITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THIS RATIO WAS APPROXIMATELY 0.27 TO 1. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, AVAILABLE SHORT-TERM COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT GLOBALLY

TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $620 MILLION, OF WHICH $107 MILLION WAS UTILIZED. DEBT

COVENANTS DO NOT RESTRICT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

3M HAS

A MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM AND SHELF REGISTRATION THAT HAVE REMAINING CAPACITY

OF APPROXIMATELY $1.038 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. IN SEPTEMBER 2003,

THE COMPANY FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION RELATING TO THE POTENTIAL OFFERING OF DEBT SECURITIES OF UP

TO $1.5 BILLION. THIS SHELF REGISTRATION BECAME EFFECTIVE IN OCTOBER 2003. IN

DECEMBER 2003, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE SHELF A MEDIUM-TERM NOTES

PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH UP TO $1.5 BILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MAY BE OFFERED.

IN NOVEMBER 2006, 3M ISSUED A THREE-YEAR, $400 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE. THE

COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP TO CONVERT THIS TO A RATE BASED ON A

FLOATING LIBOR INDEX. IN DECEMBER 2004, 3M ISSUED A 40-YEAR, $62 MILLION,

FLOATING RATE NOTE, WITH THE RATE BASED ON A FLOATING LIBOR INDEX. 3M PLANS TO

USE THE NET PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF DEBT SECURITIES UNDER THIS REGISTRATION

FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT; INVESTMENTS IN

OR EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO 3M SUBSIDIARIES; OR THE FINANCING OF POSSIBLE

ACQUISITIONS OR BUSINESS EXPANSION.

3M

MAY REDEEM ITS 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES (THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES) AT

ANY TIME IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BEGINNING NOVEMBER 21, 2007, AT THE ACCRETED

CONVERSION PRICE; HOWEVER, BONDHOLDERS MAY CONVERT UPON NOTIFICATION OF

REDEMPTION INTO 9.4602 SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK. HOLDERS OF THE 30-YEAR

ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES HAVE THE OPTION TO REQUIRE 3M TO PURCHASE THEIR NOTES

AT ACCRETED VALUE ON NOVEMBER 21 IN THE YEARS 2005, 2007, 2012, 2017, 2022 AND

2027. IN NOVEMBER 2005, 22,506 OF THE 639,000 IN OUTSTANDING BONDS WERE

REDEEMED, RESULTING IN A PAYOUT FROM 3M OF APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION. THIS

REDUCED THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES FACE VALUE AT MATURITY TO $616 MILLION, WHICH

EQUATES TO A BOOK VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $542 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. AS

DISCLOSED IN A FORM 8-K IN NOVEMBER 2005, 3M AMENDED THE TERMS OF THESE

SECURITIES TO PAY CASH AT A RATE OF 2.40% PER ANNUM OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AT

MATURITY OF THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES, WHICH EQUATES TO 2.75% PER ANNUM

OF THE NOTES ACCRETED VALUE ON NOVEMBER 21, 2005. THE CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS

WILL BE MADE SEMIANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON MAY 22, 2006, NOVEMBER 22, 2006, MAY

22, 2007 AND NOVEMBER 22, 2007 TO HOLDERS OF RECORD ON THE 15TH CALENDAR DAY

PRECEDING EACH SUCH INTEREST PAYMENT DATE.

3M

ORIGINALLY SOLD $639 MILLION IN AGGREGATE FACE AMOUNT OF THESE CONVERTIBLE

NOTES ON NOVEMBER 15, 2002, WHICH ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF 3M COMMON

STOCK. THE GROSS PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING, TO BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE

PURPOSES, WERE $550 MILLION ($540 MILLION NET OF ISSUANCE COSTS). DEBT ISSUANCE

COSTS WERE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD

BEGINNING IN NOVEMBER 2002. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2003, 3M REGISTERED THESE

CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN A REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THE TERMS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES INCLUDE A YIELD TO

MATURITY OF .50% AND AN INITIAL CONVERSION PREMIUM OF 40% OVER THE $65.00

(SPLIT-ADJUSTED) CLOSING PRICE OF 3M COMMON STOCK ON NOVEMBER 14, 2002. IF

OF 3M EXCEEDING THE CONVERSION TRIGGER PRICE FOR SPECIFIED PERIODS) ARE MET,

HOLDERS MAY CONVERT EACH OF THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES INTO 9.4602

SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK IN ANY CALENDAR QUARTER COMMENCING AFTER MARCH 31,

2003. THE CONVERSION TRIGGER PRICE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006 WAS $120.60

PER SHARE. IF THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, AND 3M ELECTS NOT TO

SETTLE IN CASH, THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE IN THE

AGGREGATE INTO APPROXIMATELY 5.8 MILLION SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK. 3M MAY

CHOOSE TO PAY THE

60

REDEMPTION

PURCHASE PRICE IN CASH AND/OR COMMON STOCK; HOWEVER, IF REDEMPTION OCCURS, THE

COMPANY HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO SETTLE THIS DEBT SECURITY IN CASH. THE

CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION HAVE NEVER BEEN MET; ACCORDINGLY, THERE HAS BEEN NO

IMPACT ON 3MS DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE. FOR A DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING

PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT WILL AFFECT ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES,

REFER TO NOTE 1 FOR DISCUSSION OF EITF ISSUE NO. 04-08, THE EFFECT OF

CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT ON DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND PROPOSED SFAS

NO. 128R, EARNINGS PER SHARE.

IN DECEMBER 2006, THE

COMPANYS $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE REMARKETED FOR

ONE YEAR. THEY WERE REISSUED WITH A FIXED COUPON RATE OF 5.66%. THESE

SECURITIES, WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, WERE

ISSUED IN DECEMBER 2000. THE REMARKETABLE SECURITIES CAN BE REMARKETED

ANNUALLY, AT THE OPTION OF THE DEALER, FOR A YEAR EACH TIME, WITH A FINAL

MATURITY DATE OF DECEMBER 2010.

NOTE 11.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

3M

HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S.

EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENSION BENEFITS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANS GENERALLY ARE BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF

SERVICE, COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IN ADDITION TO

PROVIDING PENSION BENEFITS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES CERTAIN POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH

CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS U.S. EMPLOYEES

WHO REACH RETIREMENT AGE WHILE EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. MOST INTERNATIONAL

EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES ARE COVERED BY GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. THE COST

OF COMPANY-PROVIDED POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE PLANS FOR INTERNATIONAL

EMPLOYEES IS NOT MATERIAL AND IS COMBINED WITH U.S. AMOUNTS.

THE

COMPANYS PENSION FUNDING POLICY IS TO DEPOSIT WITH INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES

AMOUNTS ALLOWABLE BY LAW. TRUST FUNDS AND DEPOSITS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

MAINTAINED TO PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR

BENEFICIARIES. THERE ARE NO PLAN ASSETS IN THE NON-QUALIFIED PLAN DUE TO ITS

NATURE. FOR ITS U.S. POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PLANS,

THE COMPANY HAS SET ASIDE AMOUNTS AT LEAST EQUAL TO ANNUAL BENEFIT PAYMENTS

WITH AN INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE.

THE

COMPANY COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF CUNO DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005.

CUNO HAS SEVERAL U.S. PLANS AND AN INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLAN. THE U.S. PLANS

HAD A COMBINED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF $53 MILLION AND PLAN ASSETS OF

$42 MILLION AS OF AUGUST 1, 2005. THE INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLAN HAD A

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF $13 MILLION AND PLAN ASSETS OF $10 MILLION AS

OF AUGUST 1, 2005. THESE PLANS ARE INCLUDED IN THE BALANCES OF THE APPROPRIATE

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL CATEGORIES IN THE TABLES THAT FOLLOW.

IN

AUGUST 2006, THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT (PPA) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN THE U.S.

THE PPA REPLACES THE FUNDING REQUIREMENTS FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS BY

SUBJECTING DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS TO 100% OF THE CURRENT LIABILITY FUNDING

TARGET. DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS WITH A FUNDING STATUS OF LESS THAN 80% OF THE

CURRENT LIABILITY ARE DEFINED AS BEING AT RISK. THE PPA IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE

2008 PLAN YEAR. 3MS U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE FUNDED IN EXCESS

OF 80%, AND THEREFORE THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE PLANS WILL NOT BE SUBJECT TO

THE AT RISK FUNDING REQUIREMENTS OF THE PPA AND THAT THE LAW WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE

FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND

132(R). THIS STANDARD REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO RECOGNIZE THE UNDERFUNDED OR

OVERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS AN

ASSET OR LIABILITY IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, AND RECOGNIZE

CHANGES IN THE FUNDED STATUS IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR THROUGH

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH IS A COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY. THIS STANDARD ALSO ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT FOR ADDITIONAL MINIMUM

PENSION LIABILITY (AML) REQUIRED UNDER SFAS NO. 87. AS A RESULT OF THE

APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 158 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, 3M REVERSED ASSETS OF $2.515

BILLION AND INCREASED LIABILITIES BY $703 MILLION. THESE LIABILITIES WERE

OFFSET TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND DEFERRED TAXES. AS A

RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SFAS NO. 158, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN

AFTER-TAX DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $1.187 BILLION

AND $513 MILLION FOR THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION BENEFIT PLANS,

RESPECTIVELY, AND $218 MILLION FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE

INSURANCE BENEFIT PLAN.

THE COMPANY CONVERTED TO THE RP (RETIREMENT PLANS) 2000 MORTALITY TABLE FOR

CALCULATING THE YEAR-END 2005 U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND

2006 EXPENSE. THE IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE INCREASED THE YEAR-END 2005 U.S.

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR PENSION BY $385 MILLION, THE YEAR-END 2005

U.S. ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR PENSION BY $349 MILLION AND THE 2005

U.S. ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

OBLIGATION BY $93

$64 MILLION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSES BY $17 MILLION.

THE COMPANY REVIEWS

EXTERNAL DATA AND ITS OWN HISTORICAL TRENDS FOR HEALTH CARE COSTS TO DETERMINE

THE HEALTH CARE TREND RATES FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS. AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2006, THE COMPANY MODIFIED ITS HEALTH CARE TREND RATES ASSUMPTION BY

RAISING THE RATE AND SEPARATING THE TREND RATES USED FOR PLAN PARTICIPANTS LESS

THAN 65 YEARS OF AGE AND PLAN PARTICIPANTS GREATER THAN 65 YEARS OF AGE. THE

SEPARATION OF THE TREND RATES REFLECTS THE HIGHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THE GREATER THAN 65 AGE GROUP. THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE

TREND RATES AS OF DECEMBER 31 ARE AS FOLLOWS.

3MS

INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IS TO MANAGE THE

PLANS ON A GOING-CONCERN BASIS. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE FUNDS IS TO MEET THE

OBLIGATIONS AS REQUIRED. THE SECONDARY GOAL IS TO EARN THE HIGHEST RATE OF

RETURN POSSIBLE, WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING ITS PRIMARY GOAL, AND WITHOUT SUBJECTING

THE COMPANY TO AN UNDUE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTION RATE VOLATILITY. FUND RETURNS

ARE USED TO HELP FINANCE PRESENT AND FUTURE OBLIGATIONS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE

WITHIN ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED FUNDING LIMITS AND TAX-DETERMINED ASSET LIMITS,

THUS REDUCING THE LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTIONS 3M MUST MAKE.

3M

DOES NOT BUY OR SELL ANY OF ITS OWN STOCK AS A DIRECT INVESTMENT FOR ITS PENSION

AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT FUNDS. HOWEVER, DUE TO EXTERNAL INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT OF THE FUNDS, THE PLANS MAY INDIRECTLY BUY, SELL OR HOLD 3M STOCK.

THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE SHARES WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE MATERIAL

RELATIVE TO THE AGGREGATE FUND PERCENTAGES.

FOR THE U.S. PENSION

PLAN, THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.75%

IN 2006. PROJECTED RETURNS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON BROAD, PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY

AND FIXED-INCOME INDICES AND FORWARD-LOOKING ESTIMATES OF ACTIVE PORTFOLIO AND

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANYS EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S.

PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON AN ASSET ALLOCATION ASSUMPTION OF 44% U.S. AND 15%

INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, WITH AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF 8.0% FOR

BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES; 13% PRIVATE EQUITIES WITH AN EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF 13.0%; 28% FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES WITH AN EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF 5.0%; AND AN ADDITIONAL RATE OF RETURN OF 0.95%

FROM ACTIVE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSUMPTIONS RESULT IN AN 8.75%

EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. THE PLAN ASSETS EARNED A RATE

OF RETURN IN EXCESS OF 12%, 10% AND 13% IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

THE AVERAGE ANNUAL ACTUAL RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS OVER THE PAST 10 AND 25

YEARS HAS BEEN 10.0% AND 12.7%, RESPECTIVELY.

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY MADE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS

TOTALING $200 MILLION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. IN 2007, THE COMPANY

EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE AN AMOUNT IN THE RANGE OF $100 MILLION TO $400 MILLION TO

ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED

MINIMUM PENSION CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2007. THEREFORE,

THE AMOUNT OF THE ANTICIPATED DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION COULD VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE U.S. PLANS FUNDING STATUS AS OF THE 2007

MEASUREMENT DATE AND THE ANTICIPATED TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE CONTRIBUTION.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY TRANSFERRED A PORTION OF ITS

SUMITOMO 3M PENSION LIABILITIES AND ASSETS TO THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT, AS

ALLOWED BY A JAPANESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWED 3M TO TRANSFER

$145 MILLION IN PENSION LIABILITIES AND $74 MILLION IN PENSION ASSETS TO THE

JAPANESE GOVERNMENT. THE COMPANY REMEASURED ITS PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION

AND PLAN ASSETS TO INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF THIS TRANSFER. AS A RESULT OF THE

REMEASUREMENT, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A GAIN OF $8 MILLION. THE GAIN PARTIALLY

OFFSETS THE 2005 NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST.

NOTE 12.  DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY

SWAPS, AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED

WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. THE

INFORMATION THAT FOLLOWS EXPLAINS THE VARIOUS TYPES OF DERIVATIVES AND

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND INCLUDES A TABLE THAT RECAPS CASH FLOW HEDGING

AMOUNTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD

CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAPS TO HEDGE AGAINST THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN

INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH

FLOW HEDGES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD VARIOUS OPEN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAD MATURITIES OF

ONE YEAR OR LESS. THE SETTLEMENT OR EXTENSION OF THESE DERIVATIVES WILL RESULT

IN RECLASSIFICATIONS TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED

TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS (FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME). THE MAXIMUM

LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH 3M IS HEDGING ITS EXPOSURE TO THE VARIABILITY IN

FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR A MAJORITY OF THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS IS 12 MONTHS.

HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS 2006, 2005 AND 2004.

COMMODITY PRICE MANAGEMENT.

THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY

CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS. THE

COMPANY USES COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS TO MANAGE PRICE VOLATILITY. THE RELATED MARK-TO-MARKET GAIN OR

LOSS ON QUALIFYING HEDGES IS INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO THE

EXTENT EFFECTIVE, AND RECLASSIFIED INTO COST OF SALES IN THE PERIOD DURING

WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. 3M HAS HEDGED ITS EXPOSURE TO

THE VARIABILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS

THROUGH 2008. NO SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY CASH FLOW HEDGES WERE DISCONTINUED AND

HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL DURING THE YEARS 2006, 2005 AND 2004.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECLASSIFY TO EARNINGS OVER

THE NEXT 12 MONTHS A MAJORITY OF THE CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AFTER-TAX

LOSS OF

$18 MILLION (WITH THE IMPACT

OFFSET BY CASH FLOWS FROM UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEMS).

INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES INTEREST EXPENSE USING A MIX OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATE

DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE BORROWING COSTS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE

SWAPS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY

67

AGREES TO EXCHANGE, AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED

AND FLOATING INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AN AGREED-UPON

NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD INTEREST RATE SWAPS DESIGNATED AS

FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF UNDERLYING FIXED RATE OBLIGATIONS (NONE AT DECEMBER 31,

2005). IN JUNE 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $330 MILLION FIXED-TO-FLOATING

INTEREST RATE SWAP TO HEDGE THE 30-YEAR BOND DUE IN 2028. IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE

COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $400 MILLION FIXED-TO-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAP

CONCURRENT WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE THREE-YEAR MEDIUM-TERM NOTE DUE IN 2009.

THE MARK-TO-MARKET OF THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES IS RECORDED AS GAINS OR LOSSES IN

INTEREST EXPENSE AND IS OFFSET BY THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE UNDERLYING DEBT

INSTRUMENT, WHICH ALSO IS RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE

INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS $26 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. THESE FAIR VALUE

HEDGES ARE 100% EFFECTIVE AND, THUS, THERE IS NO IMPACT ON EARNINGS DUE TO

HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS.

NET

INVESTMENT HEDGING.

AS

CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, THE COMPANY USES CROSS CURRENCY SWAPS AND FORWARDS TO

HEDGE PORTIONS OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. FOR

HEDGES THAT MEET THE EFFECTIVENESS REQUIREMENTS, THE NET GAINS OR LOSSES

ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN SPOT EXCHANGE RATES ARE RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE

TRANSLATION WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE REMAINDER OF THE CHANGE IN

VALUE OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS IS RECORDED IN EARNINGS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR

FLOATING-TO-FLOATING CROSS CURRENCY SWAP WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $300

MILLION. THIS TRANSACTION IS A PARTIAL HEDGE OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN

ITS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THIS SWAP CONVERTS U.S. DOLLAR-BASED VARIABLE

INTEREST PAYMENTS TO YEN-BASED VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

NOTIONAL AMOUNT.

IN NOVEMBER 2006,

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR

FLOATING-TO-FLOATING

CROSS

CURRENCY SWAP WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $200 MILLION. THIS

TRANSACTION IS A PARTIAL HEDGE OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS EUROPEAN

SUBSIDIARIES. THIS SWAP CONVERTS

U.S.

DOLLAR-BASED VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS

TO EURO-

BASED VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT.

IN DECEMBER 2006, THE

COMPANY ENTERED INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT

OF $556 MILLION RELATIVE TO THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS EUROPEAN

SUBSIDIARIES AND WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $209 MILLION RELATIVE TO THE COMPANYS

NET INVESTMENT IN ITS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THESE FORWARDS MATURE IN DECEMBER

2007.

THE

UNREALIZED LOSS RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION RELATED TO NET INVESTMENT

HEDGING AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 WAS $18

MILLION AND THE UNREALIZED GAIN AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 WAS $47 MILLION.

CURRENCY EFFECTS.

3M ESTIMATES THAT

YEAR-ON-YEAR CURRENCY EFFECTS, INCLUDING HEDGING IMPACTS, INCREASED NET INCOME

BY APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION IN 2006, $115 MILLION IN 2005, AND $181 MILLION IN

2004. THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF TRANSLATING PROFITS FROM LOCAL

CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS; THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE

TRANSFER OF GOODS BETWEEN 3M OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD; AND

TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED TO

REDUCE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISKS. 3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR

DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES HAD AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT ON

NET INCOME IN 2006 AND INCREASED NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION IN

2005 AND $48 MILLION IN 2004.

CREDIT RISK.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE

EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES IN INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY

SWAPS, AND OPTION AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS RISK

IS LIMITED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MONITORS

ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH THE USE OF CREDIT APPROVALS AND CREDIT

LIMITS, AND BY SELECTING MAJOR INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

AS COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NON-PERFORMANCE BY ANY OF

THESE COUNTERPARTIES.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY

ENTERED INTO A CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENT WITH ONE OF ITS PRIMARY DERIVATIVES

COUNTERPARTIES. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EITHER PARTY IS REQUIRED TO POST ELIGIBLE

COLLATERAL WHEN THE MARKET VALUE OF TRANSACTIONS COVERED BY THE AGREEMENT

EXCEEDS SPECIFIED THRESHOLDS, THUS LIMITING CREDIT EXPOSURE FOR BOTH PARTIES.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006

AND 2005, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE, BORROWINGS, AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT (EXCEPT THE $350 MILLION DEALER

REMARKETABLE SECURITY) APPROXIMATED CARRYING VALUES BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM

NATURE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES, INVESTMENTS

AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUES FOR

INVESTMENTS HELD AT COST ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE, BUT ARE ESTIMATED TO

APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE. THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS BASED ON THIRD-PARTY QUOTES AS OF DECEMBER 31 FOLLOW.

THEREBY GIVING 3M THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO MAINTAIN A PRESENCE IN

A LEASED FACILITY. 3MS PRIMARY CAPITAL LEASE, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN APRIL

2003, INVOLVES A BUILDING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (WITH A LEASE TERM OF 22

YEARS). DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, 3M RECORDED A CAPITAL LEASE ASSET

AND OBLIGATION OF APPROXIMATELY 33.5 MILLION UNITED KINGDOM POUNDS

(APPROXIMATELY $66 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 EXCHANGE RATES). MINIMUM LEASE

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY AND SOME OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS CLAIMS

AND LAWSUITS, PRINCIPALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

WORLDWIDE. THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS PRODUCTS LIABILITY (INVOLVING PRODUCTS THAT

THE COMPANY NOW OR FORMERLY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD), INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND

COMMERCIAL CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS, INCLUDING THOSE BROUGHT UNDER THE ANTITRUST

LAWS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS FIRST DESCRIBE THE

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED, AND THEN DESCRIBE

THE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES THE COMPANY HAS ACCRUED

RELATING TO ITS SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, THE

COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ALL SUCH LITIGATION.

69

ANTITRUST

LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, LEPAGES INC., A TRANSPARENT TAPE COMPETITOR OF 3M, FILED A LAWSUIT

AGAINST THE COMPANY IN JUNE 1997 ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN MARKETING PRACTICES OF

THE COMPANY CONSTITUTED UNLAWFUL MONOPOLIZATION UNDER THE ANTITRUST LAWS.

FOLLOWING THE ENTRY OF A VERDICT IN LEPAGES FAVOR

AND APPELLATE RULINGS SUSTAINING THAT VERDICT, DIRECT AND INDIRECT TAPE

PURCHASERS FILED A NUMBER OF PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS

AGAINST THE COMPANY IN VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS. THESE CASES ALLEGED

THAT THE COMPANY COMPETED UNFAIRLY AND UNLAWFULLY MONOPOLIZED ALLEGED MARKETS

FOR TRANSPARENT TAPE, AND SOUGHT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND DAMAGES IN THE FORM OF

PRICE OVERCHARGES THE COMPANY ALLEGEDLY CHARGED FOR THESE PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED EACH OF THESE ACTIONS. THE SETTLEMENTS OF THE

VARIOUS PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS RECEIVED FINAL COURT APPROVAL IN 2006, AND THE

SETTLEMENT OF THE SINGLE CERTIFIED CLASS ACTION PENDING IN THE FEDERAL COURT IN

PENNSYLVANIA RECEIVED PRELIMINARY COURT APPROVAL IN THE FALL OF 2006 AND IS

SCHEDULED FOR A FINAL COURT APPROVAL HEARING IN THE SPRING OF 2007.

BREAST

IMPLANT LITIGATION

THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OTHER COMPANIES WERE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN PAST

YEARS IN NUMEROUS CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS ALLEGING DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES OF

VARIOUS TYPES RESULTING FROM BREAST IMPLANTS FORMERLY MANUFACTURED BY THE

COMPANY OR A RELATED COMPANY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY

HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER ITS REMAINING PROBABLE

LIABILITY TO BE MATERIAL. INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ASSOCIATED INSURANCE

RECEIVABLE AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO IT FOLLOWS IN THE PARAGRAPH

ENTITLED

BREAST IMPLANT INSURANCE

RECEIVABLES.

RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION

FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS THE COMPANY HAS DEFENDED AND RESOLVED THE CLAIMS

OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS ALLEGING INJURIES FROM

OCCUPATIONAL DUST EXPOSURES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY IS A NAMED

DEFENDANT, WITH MULTIPLE CO-DEFENDANTS, IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS IN VARIOUS COURTS

THAT PURPORT TO REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 17,700 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS, A DECREASE

FROM THE APPROXIMATELY 48,600 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS WITH ACTIONS PENDING AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RESOLVED BY AND CURRENTLY

PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGE USE OF SOME OF THE COMPANYS MASK AND

RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND SEEK DAMAGES FROM THE COMPANY AND OTHER DEFENDANTS FOR

ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY FROM WORKPLACE EXPOSURES TO ASBESTOS, SILICA, COAL OR

OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS FOUND IN PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS OR

GENERALLY IN THE WORKPLACE. THE REMAINING CLAIMANTS GENERALLY ALLEGE PERSONAL

INJURY FROM OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS FROM PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY

MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH ARE OFTEN UNSPECIFIED, AND BY OTHER

DEFENDANTS, OR OCCASIONALLY AT COMPANY PREMISES.

IN MANY OF THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE COMPANY IS NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT WITH MULTIPLE CO-DEFENDANTS WHERE NO PRODUCT THE COMPANY MANUFACTURED

IS IDENTIFIED OR WHERE THE COMPANY IS ULTIMATELY DETERMINED NOT TO HAVE MANUFACTURED

THE PRODUCTS IDENTIFIED BY THE PLAINTIFFS. THE COMPANYS VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF

THIS LITIGATION HAS RESULTED IN: (I) DISMISSALS OF MANY CLAIMS WITHOUT ANY

PAYMENT BY THE COMPANY INCLUDING MORE THAN 20,000 SUCH DISMISSALS IN 2006

ALONE; (II) AN AVERAGE SETTLEMENT VALUE OF LESS THAN $1,000 PER CLAIMANT FOR

ALL OF THE CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS THAT THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED, INCLUDING THOSE

DISMISSED WITHOUT PAYMENT; AND (III) JURY VERDICTS FOR THE COMPANY IN SIX OF

THE SEVEN CASES TRIED TO VERDICT (SUCH TRIALS OCCURRED IN 1999, 2000, 2003 AND

2004), AND AN APPELLATE REVERSAL IN 2005 OF THE ONE JURY VERDICT ADVERSE TO THE

COMPANY.

MANY OF THE RESOLVED LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS INVOLVED UNIMPAIRED CLAIMANTS

WHO WERE RECRUITED BY PLAINTIFFS LAWYERS THROUGH MASS CHEST X-RAY SCREENINGS.

THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS FILED IN

2006 FROM PRIOR YEARS BY APPARENTLY UNIMPAIRED CLAIMANTS. THE COMPANY

ATTRIBUTES THIS DECLINE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING CERTAIN CHANGES ENACTED

IN SEVERAL STATES IN RECENT YEARS OF THE LAW GOVERNING ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS,

AND THE HIGHLY-PUBLICIZED DECISION IN MID-2005 OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS THAT IDENTIFIED AND CRITICIZED ABUSES

BY CERTAIN ATTORNEYS, DOCTORS AND X-RAY SCREENING COMPANIES ON BEHALF OF

CLAIMANTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE FILING OF CLAIMS BY UNIMPAIRED CLAIMANTS IN

THE FUTURE TO CONTINUE AT MUCH LOWER LEVELS THAN IN THE PAST. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT DUE TO THIS CHANGE IN THE TYPE AND VOLUME OF INCOMING CLAIMS, IT

IS LIKELY THAT THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS ALLEGING MORE SERIOUS INJURIES, INCLUDING

MESOTHELIOMA AND OTHER MALIGNANCIES, WHILE REMAINING RELATIVELY CONSTANT, WILL

REPRESENT A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CLAIMS THAN IN THE PAST. THE COMPANY

HAS DEMONSTRATED IN PAST TRIAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ITS RESPIRATORY PROTECTION

PRODUCTS ARE EFFECTIVE AS CLAIMED WHEN USED IN THE INTENDED MANNER AND IN THE

INTENDED CIRCUMSTANCES. CONSEQUENTLY THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CLAIMANTS ARE

UNABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT THEIR MEDICAL CONDITION, EVEN IF SIGNIFICANT, IS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANYS RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS. NONETHELESS THE

COMPANYS LITIGATION EXPERIENCE INDICATES THAT SUCH CLAIMS ARE COSTLIER TO

RESOLVE THAN THE CLAIMS OF UNIMPAIRED PERSONS, AND IT THEREFORE ANTICIPATES AN

INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING PENDING AND FUTURE CLAIMS ON A

PER-CLAIM BASIS THAN IT EXPERIENCED IN PRIOR PERIODS WHEN THE VAST MAJORITY OF

CLAIMS WERE ASSERTED BY THE UNIMPAIRED.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE ASSERTED SPECIFIC DOLLAR CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES IN

APPROXIMATELY 64% OF THE 6,108 LAWSUITS THAT WERE PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY

AT THE END OF 2006 IN ALL JURISDICTIONS. A MAJORITY OF STATES RESTRICT OR

PROHIBIT SPECIFYING DAMAGES IN TORT CASES SUCH AS THESE, AND MOST OF THE

REMAINING JURISDICTIONS DO NOT REQUIRE SUCH SPECIFICATION. IN THOSE CASES IN

WHICH

70

PLAINTIFFS CHOOSE TO ASSERT SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THEIR COMPLAINTS,

BROUGHT IN STATES THAT PERMIT SUCH PLEADING, THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED ARE TYPICALLY

NOT MEANINGFUL AS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY. THIS IS

BECAUSE (A) THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED TYPICALLY BEAR NO RELATION TO THE EXTENT OF THE

PLAINTIFFS INJURY, IF ANY; (B) THE COMPLAINTS NEARLY ALWAYS ASSERT CLAIMS

AGAINST MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS WITH THE TYPICAL COMPLAINT ASSERTING CLAIMS AGAINST

AS FEW AS A DOZEN DIFFERENT DEFENDANTS TO UPWARDS OF 275 DIFFERENT DEFENDANTS,

THE DAMAGES ALLEGED ARE NOT ATTRIBUTED TO INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS, AND A

DEFENDANTS SHARE OF LIABILITY MAY TURN ON THE LAW OF JOINT AND SEVERAL

LIABILITY, WHICH CAN VARY BY STATE, AND BY THE AMOUNT OF FAULT A JURY ALLOCATES

TO EACH DEFENDANT IF A CASE IS ULTIMATELY TRIED BEFORE A JURY; (C) MANY CASES

ARE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY EVEN THOUGH THE PLAINTIFFS DID NOT USE ANY OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND, ULTIMATELY, ARE WITHDRAWN OR DISMISSED WITHOUT ANY

PAYMENT; AND (D) MANY CASES ARE BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFFS WHO HAVE NOT

SUFFERED ANY MEDICAL INJURY, AND, ULTIMATELY, ARE RESOLVED WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT

OR A PAYMENT THAT IS A SMALL FRACTION OF THE DAMAGES INITIALLY CLAIMED. OF THE

3,917 PENDING CASES IN WHICH PURPORTED DAMAGE AMOUNTS ARE SPECIFIED IN THE

COMPLAINTS,

2,207 CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $100,000 OR LESS (88 OF THEM

ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $10,000, 16 OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE

DAMAGES OF $15,000, AND THREE OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF

$1,000,000); 168 CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS ABOVE $100,000 UP TO $3 MILLION (45 OF

THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $250,000, 72 OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE

DAMAGES OF $350,000, ONE OF THEM ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $1 MILLION,

45 OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $1.5 MILLION, AND ONE OF THEM ALSO

ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $2 MILLION); THREE CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS ABOVE $3

MILLION BUT LESS THAN $7.5 MILLION (TWO ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF

$350,000 AND ONE OF THEM ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $5 MILLION);

31 CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $7.5

MILLION; FIVE CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS ABOVE $7.5 MILLION BUT LESS THAN $10 MILLION

(FOUR OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $21 MILLION); 1,473 CASES INVOLVE

CLAIMS OF $10 MILLION (1,405 OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $10

MILLION, AND ONE OF THEM ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $15 MILLION); 24

CASES INVOLVED CLAIMS ABOVE $10 MILLION BUT LESS THAN $50 MILLION (TWO OF THEM

ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $350,000, TWO OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE

DAMAGES OF $15 MILLION, FIVE OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $15.5

MILLION, AND FOUR OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $20 MILLION); AND SIX

CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $50 MILLION (FIVE OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES

OF $50 MILLION).

SOME COMPLAINTS ALLEGE THAT

THE COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE AT LEAST THE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED. AS

STATED, THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE AND THE OTHER REASONS CITED INDICATE THAT THE

DAMAGE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED IN COMPLAINTS ARE NOT A MEANINGFUL FACTOR IN ANY

ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA, THROUGH ITS ATTORNEY

GENERAL, FILED A COMPLAINT IN 2003 AGAINST THE COMPANY AND TWO OTHER MANUFACTURERS

OF RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF LINCOLN COUNTY, WEST

VIRGINIA AND AMENDED IT IN 2005. THE AMENDED COMPLAINT SEEKS SUBSTANTIAL, BUT

UNSPECIFIED, COMPENSATORY DAMAGES PRIMARILY FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF THE COSTS

ALLEGEDLY INCURRED BY THE STATE FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION AND HEALTHCARE

BENEFITS PROVIDED TO

ALL WORKERS WITH OCCUPATIONAL

PNEUMOCONIOSIS, INCLUDING CURRENT OR FORMER

MINERS ALLEGEDLY SUFFERING FROM SILICOSIS AND/OR COAL MINERS PNEUMOCONIOSIS (BLACK

LUNG DISEASE) AND

UNSPECIFIED PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

EMPLOYMENT LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ONE CURRENT AND ONE FORMER EMPLOYEE OF THE

COMPANY FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF RAMSEY COUNTY,

MINNESOTA IN DECEMBER 2004, SEEKING TO REPRESENT A CLASS OF ALL CURRENT AND

CERTAIN FORMER SALARIED EMPLOYEES EMPLOYED BY 3M IN MINNESOTA BELOW A CERTAIN

SALARY GRADE WHO WERE AGE 46 OR OLDER AT ANY TIME DURING THE APPLICABLE PERIOD

TO BE DETERMINED BY THE COURT. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THE PLAINTIFFS SUFFERED

VARIOUS FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF AGE IN VIOLATION OF

THE MINNESOTA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT AND SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, UNSPECIFIED

COMPENSATORY (UP TO TRIPLE ACTUAL DAMAGES) AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF

$50,000, INCLUDING BACK AND FRONT PAY AND ATTORNEYS FEES. IN JANUARY 2006, THE

PLAINTIFFS FILED A MOTION TO JOIN FOUR ADDITIONAL NAMED PLAINTIFFS. THIS MOTION

WAS UNOPPOSED BY THE COMPANY AND THE FOUR PLAINTIFFS WERE JOINED IN THE CASE,

ALTHOUGH ONE CLAIM HAS BEEN DISMISSED FOLLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL SETTLEMENT.

A SIMILAR AGE DISCRIMINATION PURPORTED CLASS ACTION WAS FILED AGAINST

THE COMPANY IN NOVEMBER 2005 IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF ESSEX COUNTY, NEW JERSEY

ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OF NEW JERSEY-BASED EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY

REMOVED THIS CASE TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW

JERSEY. IN ADDITION, THREE FORMER EMPLOYEES FILED AGE DISCRIMINATION CHARGES

AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH THE U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND

THE PERTINENT STATE AGENCIES IN TEXAS, MINNESOTA AND CALIFORNIA, DURING 2005.

SUCH FILINGS INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS THAT THE RELEASE OF CLAIMS SIGNED BY CERTAIN

FORMER EMPLOYEES IN THE PURPORTED CLASS DEFINED IN THE CHARGES IS INVALID FOR

VARIOUS REASONS. IN 2006, ONE CURRENT EMPLOYEE FILED AN AGE DISCRIMINATION

CHARGE AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH THE U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY

COMMISSION AND THE PERTINENT STATE AGENCY IN MISSOURI, ASSERTING CLAIMS ON

BEHALF OF A CLASS OF ALL CURRENT AND CERTAIN FORMER SALARIED EMPLOYEES WHO

WORKED IN MISSOURI AND OTHER STATES OTHER THAN MINNESOTA AND NEW JERSEY. THE

SAME LAW FIRM REPRESENTS THE PLAINTIFFS AND CLAIMANTS IN EACH OF THESE

PROCEEDINGS.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS AND LITIGATION

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

INCLUDING THOSE PERTAINING TO AIR EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER DISCHARGES, TOXIC

SUBSTANCES, AND THE HANDLING AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTES

ENFORCEABLE BY NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AROUND THE WORLD, AND

PRIVATE PARTIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

PROVIDE, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A BASIS FOR THE REMEDIATION OF

CONTAMINATION AND FOR PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS. THE COMPANY

HAS INCURRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR, COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN

71

COMPLYING WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, DEFENDING PERSONAL INJURY AND

PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS, AND MODIFYING ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN LIGHT OF ITS

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES. IN ITS EFFORT TO SATISFY ITS ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE

COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED, AND PERIODICALLY UPDATES, POLICIES RELATING TO

ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR ITS OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE.

REMEDIATION

: UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES

COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980

AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY MAY BE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE,

TYPICALLY WITH OTHER COMPANIES, FOR THE COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AT

CURRENT OR FORMER FACILITIES AND AT OFF-SITE LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS

IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS LOCATIONS, MOST OF WHICH ARE IN THE UNITED STATES, AT WHICH

IT MAY HAVE SOME LIABILITY.

PLEASE REFER TO THE FOLLOWING SECTION, ACCRUED

LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE

INFORMATION ON THIS SUBJECT.

REGULATORY ACTIVITIES

: AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN

VOLUNTARILY COOPERATING WITH ONGOING REVIEWS BY LOCAL, STATE, NATIONAL

(PRIMARILY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)), AND INTERNATIONAL

AGENCIES OF POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH EFFECTS OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL

COMPOUNDS (PERFLUROOCTANOIC ACID OR PFOA AND PERFLUOROOCTANE SULFONATE OR PFOS)

AND RELATED COMPOUNDS. AS A RESULT OF ITS PHASE-OUT DECISION IN MAY 2000, THE

COMPANY NO LONGER MANUFACTURES PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS EXCEPT THAT A

SUBSIDIARY RECOVERS AND RECYCLES PFOA FOR INTERNAL USE IN PRODUCTION PROCESSES.

IN JANUARY, 2006, THE EPA ANNOUNCED A

VOLUNTARY INITIATIVE UNDER WHICH EIGHT COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARY REFERENCED ABOVE, WOULD COMMIT TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND PRODUCT

CONTENT OF PFOA BY 95% BY 2010 OVER LEVELS IN 2000, AND TO COMMIT TO WORKING

TOWARD THE ELIMINATION OF PFOA FROM EMISSIONS AND PRODUCTS BY 2015. THE COMPANY

IS WELL POSITIONED TO COMPLY WITH THESE OBJECTIVES IN LIGHT OF ITS PHASE OUT OF

PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY IN 2000. IN OCTOBER OF 2006, THE COMPANY SUBMITTED

ITS INITIAL REPORT UNDER THIS VOLUNTARY INITIATIVE.

IN JANUARY 2005, THE EPA ISSUED A DRAFT RISK ASSESSMENT FOR PFOA AND

SUBMITTED IT FOR REVIEW TO THE EPA SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD. THE EPA DOCUMENT

EXPRESSES THE EPAS PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT IN TERMS OF THE MARGIN OF EXPOSURE

BETWEEN THE LEVELS OF THAT COMPOUND THAT CAUSE ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS IN LABORATORY

ANIMALS AND THE LEVELS FOUND IN HUMAN BLOOD SERA IN THE U.S. POPULATION.

A PANEL CONVENED BY THE SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD ISSUED A DRAFT REPORT IN JUNE

2005 AND A REVISED DRAFT IN JANUARY 2006. THE SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD HAS

CONDITIONALLY APPROVED THE REVISED DRAFT OF THE PANEL, WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS

RECOMMENDED THAT EPA CLASSIFY PFOA UNDER THE EPAS HAZARD DESCRIPTOR OF LIKELY

TO BE CARCINOGENIC TO HUMANS. THE SELECTION BY THE PANEL OF THIS DESCRIPTOR

WAS BASED UPON THE VIEW THAT DATA FROM TWO STUDIES SHOW THAT PFOA IS A

MULTISITE CARCINOGEN IN RATS. THE COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THIS CLASSIFICATION

SINCE THE PANEL DID NOT CONSIDER OTHER IMPORTANT DATA. THE EPA IS EXPECTED TO

MAKE A FINAL RISK ASSESSMENT BASED ON ITS WORK TO DATE AND ADDITIONAL DATA NOT

CONSIDERED BY THE SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD. IN JANUARY 2006, THE EPA STATED THAT

TO DATE IT IS NOT AWARE OF ANY STUDIES SPECIFICALLY RELATING CURRENT LEVELS OF

PFOA EXPOSURE TO HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS.

THE EPA SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMPANY AND DYNEON

LLC, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, IN OCTOBER, 2004, UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY IS

MONITORING THE POTENTIAL PRESENCE OF PFOA AT AND AROUND THE COMPANYS

MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN DECATUR, ALABAMA. ACTIVITIES ARE IN PROGRESS PURSUANT

TO THIS MEMORANDUM OF UNDERSTANDING.

REGULATORY

ACTIVITIES CONCERNING PFOA AND/OR PFOS CONTINUE IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, AND

BEFORE CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL BODIES. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE GATHERING OF

EXPOSURE AND USE INFORMATION, RISK ASSESSMENT, AND CONSIDERATION OF REGULATORY

APPROACHES. ON OCTOBER 25, 2006, THE EUROPEAN UNION PARLIAMENT PASSED PROPOSED

RESTRICTIONS ON THE MARKETING AND USE OF PFOS.

THE DIRECTIVE WILL GO INTO FORCE WHEN THE EC FORMALLY ADOPTS AND

PUBLISHES THE REGULATION. ONCE PUBLISHED, MEMBER STATES WILL HAVE 18 MONTHS TO

ENACT THE DIRECTIVE INTO NATIONAL LAW. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE DIRECTIVE

WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE MID-2008.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN

COOPERATING WITH THE PROCESS TO REVIEW WHETHER PFOS MEETS THE CRITERIA UNDER

THE PROTOCOL FOR PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS (POPS PROTOCOL). THIS PROTOCOL

IS PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY KNOWN AS THE CONVENTION ON LONG-RANGE

TRANSBOUNDARY AIR POLLUTION (LRTAP). IN DECEMBER OF 2005, THE EXECUTIVE BODY

COMPRISED OF PARTIES TO THE PROTOCOL DECIDED THAT THE RECORD GENERATED UNDER

THE PROTOCOL REVIEW PROCESS WAS SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE THAT PFOS QUALIFIES AS

A POP AND THAT THE REVIEW PROCESS SHOULD NOW PROCEED TO A TRACK B REVIEW

FOCUSED ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF ADDING PFOS TO THE

PROTOCOL. THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS SIGNED BUT NOT YET RATIFIED THIS

PROTOCOL, INDICATED ITS DISAGREEMENT WITH THE EXECUTIVE BODY DECISION. IN

DECEMBER OF 2006, THE EXECUTIVE BODY DECIDED THAT THE TRACK B REVIEW SHOULD

CONTINUE AND THAT FURTHER INFORMATION IS REQUIRED BEFORE A DECISION ON WHETHER

TO ADD PFOS TO THE PROTOCOL SHOULD BE MADE. PFOS ALSO HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR

ADDITION TO ANOTHER INTERNATIONAL TREATY FOCUSED ON POPS KNOWN AS THE STOCKHOLM

CONVENTION. A PROCESS TO PREPARE A RISK PROFILE FOR PFOS IS NOW PROCEEDING

UNDER THAT CONVENTION.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY AND STATE AGENCIES TESTED

GROUNDWATER BENEATH THREE FORMER WASTE DISPOSAL SITES IN WASHINGTON COUNTY,

MINNESOTA, USED MANY YEARS AGO BY THE COMPANY TO DISPOSE LAWFULLY OF WASTE

CONTAINING PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS. THE TEST RESULTS SHOW THAT WATER FROM

CERTAIN MUNICIPAL WELLS IN OAKDALE, MINNESOTA NEAR TWO OF THE FORMER DISPOSAL

SITES AND SOME PRIVATE WELLS IN THAT VICINITY IN LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA CONTAIN

LOW LEVELS OF PFOS AND PFOA THAT, IN SOME CASES, ARE SLIGHTLY ABOVE GUIDELINES

ESTABLISHED BY THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (MDH).

72

THE MDH IS REEVALUATING THESE ADVISORY HEALTH-BASED VALUES (HBV) FOR

PFOS/PFOA (I.E., THE AMOUNT OF A CHEMICAL IN DRINKING WATER CONSIDERED BY THE

MDH STAFF TO BE SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO DRINK FOR A LIFETIME) AND MAY LOWER THEM IN

THE FUTURE. ADDITIONAL TESTING BY THE MDH SHOWS THAT WATER FROM THE MUNICIPAL

WELLS IN OAKDALE, MINNESOTA AND SOME PRIVATE WELLS IN LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA ALSO

CONTAIN LOW LEVELS OF OTHER PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS. THE MDH CURRENTLY PLANS

TO APPLY THE GUIDELINES FOR PFOS/PFOA FOR SOME OF THESE COMPOUNDS. AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY ON ITS OWN INITIATIVE AGREED WITH THE CITY OF

OAKDALE TO CONSTRUCT, OPERATE AND MAINTAIN FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS A GRANULAR

ACTIVATED CARBON WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM TO TREAT ONE OR MORE OF OAKDALES

MUNICIPAL WELLS. THE COMPANY ALSO DONATED SEVERAL ACRES OF LAND TO THE CITY OF

LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA FOR A WATER TOWER AND GRANTED THE CITY APPROXIMATELY $4

MILLION THAT THE CITY WILL USE TO EXPAND MUNICIPAL WATER SERVICE TO

NEIGHBORHOODS THAT INCLUDE A SMALL NUMBER OF PRIVATE WELLS IN WHICH LEVELS OF

PFOS, PFOA AND OTHER PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN DETECTED.

THE MDH HAS ALSO RECENTLY DETECTED LOW LEVELS OF A PERFLUORONATED

COMPOUND CALLED PERFLUOROBUTANOIC ACID (PFBA) IN MUNICIPAL WELLS IN SIX NEARBY

COMMUNITIES (WOODBURY, COTTAGE GROVE, NEWPORT, ST. PAUL PARK, SOUTH ST. PAUL,

AND HASTINGS, ALL COMMUNITIES LOCATED SOUTHEAST OF ST. PAUL), SOME OF WHICH

SLIGHTLY EXCEED THE MDHS INTERIM ADVISORY LEVEL FOR PFBA. THE COMPANY IS

WORKING WITH THE MDH AND THE MINNESOTA POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY (MPCA) IN

ASSESSING THE SOURCE OF PFBA IN THESE MUNICIPAL WELLS AND IS SUPPLYING DATA THAT

COULD BE USED IN DETERMINING AN APPROPRIATE GUIDELINE LEVEL. THE MDH HAS NOT

ISSUED ANY HBV FOR PFBA AND IS TEMPORARILY APPLYING GUIDELINES IT HAS DEVELOPED

FOR PFOA. THE COMPANY HAS ADVISED THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES THAT IT WILL ASSIST

THEM IN ASSURING THEIR DRINKING WATER FALLS BELOW THE LEGALLY PERMISSIBLE LEVEL

FOR PFBA WHEN SUCH VALUE IS FINALLY DETERMINED.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO WORKING WITH THE MPCA TO DETERMINE WHETHER LOW

LEVELS OF PFOA, PFOS AND OTHER PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS IN THE SOIL AT THE

COMPANYS FORMER PERFLUORONATED COMPOUND PRODUCTION FACILITY AT COTTAGE GROVE,

MINNESOTA, IN THE GROUNDWATER UNDER THE FORMER PLANT AND DISPOSAL SITES, AND IN

RIVER SEDIMENTS NEAR THE FORMER PLANT ARE CONTINUING SOURCES OF SUCH COMPOUNDS

IN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER, ITS FISH AND WILDLIFE.

THE COMPANY MARKETS ITS NEWLY REFORMULATED

SCOTCHGARD P

RODUCTS (THAT REPLACE THE FORMULATIONS FROM WHICH

THE COMPANY BEGAN ITS PHASE-OUT IN 2000), PURSUANT TO A CONSENT AGREEMENT WITH

THE EPA THAT REQUIRES EXTENSIVE HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS TESTING OF THE

BASE CHEMISTRY UNDERLYING SUCH PRODUCTS, MOST OF WHICH HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THE

EPA HAS NOT YET ISSUED THE ANTICIPATED HAZARD ASSESSMENT OF THAT HEALTH AND

ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS TESTING FOR THE REFORMULATED SCOTCHGARD



PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHAT REGULATORY ACTIONS ARISING FROM THE

FOREGOING PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIVITIES, IF ANY, MAY BE TAKEN REGARDING SUCH

COMPOUNDS OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH ACTIONS.

LITIGATION

: AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, A FORMER EMPLOYEE FILED A PURPORTED CLASS

ACTION LAWSUIT IN 2002 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA INVOLVING

PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY, ALLEGING THAT THE PLAINTIFFS SUFFERED FEAR,

INCREASED RISK, SUBCLINICAL INJURIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM EXPOSURE TO

PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY AT OR NEAR THE COMPANYS DECATUR, ALABAMA,

MANUFACTURING FACILITY.

THE CIRCUIT COURT IN 2005 GRANTED THE COMPANYS

MOTION TO DISMISS THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS PERSONAL INJURY-RELATED CLAIMS ON THE

BASIS THAT SUCH CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE EXCLUSIVITY PROVISIONS OF THE STATES

WORKERS COMPENSATION ACT. THE PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT IN

NOVEMBER 2006, LIMITING THE CASE TO PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF A

PURPORTED CLASS OF RESIDENTS AND PROPERTY OWNERS IN THE VICINITY OF THE DECATUR

PLANT. ALSO IN

2005, THE JUDGE IN A SECOND

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT (FILED BY THREE RESIDENTS OF MORGAN COUNTY,

ALABAMA SEEKING UNSTATED COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES INVOLVING ALLEGED

DAMAGE TO THEIR PROPERTY FROM EMISSIONS OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS FROM THE

COMPANYS DECATUR, ALABAMA, MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT FORMERLY MANUFACTURED

THOSE COMPOUNDS) GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO ABATE THE CASE, EFFECTIVELY

PUTTING THE CASE ON HOLD PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF CLASS CERTIFICATION ISSUES

IN THE ACTION DESCRIBED ABOVE FILED IN THE SAME COURT IN 2002.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, TWO RESIDENTS OF WASHINGTON COUNTY, MINNESOTA,

FILED IN OCTOBER 2004 A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF

WASHINGTON COUNTY ON BEHALF OF WASHINGTON COUNTY RESIDENTS WHO HAVE ALLEGEDLY

SUFFERED PERSONAL INJURIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM ALLEGED

EMISSIONS

FROM THE FORMER PERFLUOROOCTANYL PRODUCTION FACILITY AT COTTAGE GROVE,

MINNESOTA AND FROM HISTORIC WASTE DISPOSAL SITES IN THE VICINITY OF THAT

FACILITY.

AFTER THE DISTRICT COURT

GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE CLAIMS FOR MEDICAL MONITORING AND

PUBLIC NUISANCE IN APRIL 2005, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT ADDING

ADDITIONAL ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING OTHER PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS MANUFACTURED BY

THE COMPANY, ALLEGING ADDITIONAL LEGAL THEORIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR CLAIMS,

ADDING FOUR PLAINTIFFS, AND SEEKING RELIEF BASED ON ALLEGED CONTAMINATION OF

THE CITY OF OAKDALE MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY AND CERTAIN PRIVATE WELLS IN THE

VICINITY OF LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA. IN APRIL 2006, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED A SECOND

AMENDED COMPLAINT ADDING TWO ADDITIONAL PLAINTIFFS. THE TWO ORIGINAL PLAINTIFFS

THEREAFTER DISMISSED THEIR CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY. PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL HAS

AMENDED THEIR DEFINITION OF THE PURPORTED CLASS. THE CURRENT (AND FOURTH)

DEFINITION INCLUDES ALL INDIVIDUALS WHOSE RESIDENTIAL DRINKING WATER IN

MINNESOTA IS OR HAS BEEN SUPPLIED BY ONE OR MORE WELLS CONTAINING ONE OR MORE

CARBOXYLATED PERFLUOROCHEMICALS AT A CONCENTRATION EXCEEDING 1.0 PART PER

BILLION, OR CONTAINING ONE OR MORE SULFONATED PERFLUOROCHEMICALS AT A

CONCENTRATION EXCEEDING 0.6 PART PER BILLION. PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS ARE IN

PROGRESS AND THE COURT HAS SCHEDULED A HEARING ON PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO CERTIFY

THE ACTION AS A CLASS ACTION FOR THE SPRING OF 2007.

73

SEVERAL HUNDRED PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO HAVE LIVED IN THE VICINITY OF

THE ACME BARREL COMPANYS STORAGE DRUM RECONDITIONING FACILITY IN CHICAGO,

ILLINOIS, FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF

COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS, AGAINST 3M AND A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPANIES THAT

ALLEGEDLY WERE CUSTOMERS OF ACME BARREL. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS UNSPECIFIED

DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY THE PLAINTIFFS EXPOSURE TO

CHEMICALS MIGRATING FROM ACME BARRELS DRUM RECONDITIONING OPERATIONS. THE

PLAINTIFFS ALSO ASSERT THAT A CLASS SHOULD BE CERTIFIED ON BEHALF OF ALL

PERSONS SIMILARLY SITUATED. A SEPARATE WRONGFUL DEATH LAWSUIT WAS FILED IN THE

CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS, AGAINST 3M AND A NUMBER OF OTHER

COMPANIES ON BEHALF OF THE ESTATE AND FAMILY OF A PERSON WHO WORKED AT THE COOK

COUNTY JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER IN THE VICINITY OF THE ACME BARREL FACILITY.

THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES FROM PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH

ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO CHEMICALS MIGRATING FROM ACME BARRELS DRUM

RECONDITIONING OPERATIONS.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006, THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION SERVED A LAWSUIT THAT WAS FILED IN NEW JERSEY STATE

COURT AGAINST THE COMPANY AND SEVERAL OTHER COMPANIES SEEKING CLEANUP AND

REMOVAL COSTS AND DAMAGES TO NATURAL RESOURCES ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY THE

DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES FROM A FORMER DISPOSAL SITE IN NEW JERSEY.

THE DEFENDANTS REMOVED THE CASE TO FEDERAL COURT.

ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY COMPLIES WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 5, ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES, AND RELATED

GUIDANCE, AND RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE

IT CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS AND WHERE LIABILITY IS

PROBABLE. WHERE THE REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABLE LOSS IS A RANGE, THE

COMPANY RECORDS THE MOST LIKELY ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS, OR THE LOW END OF THE

RANGE IF THERE IS NO ONE BEST ESTIMATE. THE COMPANY EITHER DISCLOSES THE AMOUNT

OF A POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF ESTABLISHED RESERVES IF

ESTIMABLE, OR STATES THAT SUCH AN ESTIMATE CANNOT BE MADE. FOR THOSE INSURED

MATTERS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN A RESERVE, THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS

RECEIVABLES FOR THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE THAT IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER UNDER THE

COMPANYS INSURANCE PROGRAM. FOR THOSE INSURED MATTERS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS

NOT TAKEN A RESERVE BECAUSE THE LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR THE AMOUNT OF THE

LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, BUT WHERE THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED AN

EXPENSE IN DEFENDING ITSELF, THE COMPANY RECORDS RECEIVABLES FOR THE AMOUNT OF

INSURANCE THAT IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER FOR THE EXPENSE INCURRED. THE COMPANY

DISCLOSES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS EVEN WHERE LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR

THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, IF THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED.

BECAUSE LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE

RULINGS OR DEVELOPMENTS COULD OCCUR, THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT THE COMPANY

MAY NOT ULTIMATELY INCUR CHARGES IN EXCESS OF PRESENTLY RECORDED LIABILITIES. A

FUTURE ADVERSE RULING, SETTLEMENT, OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN

FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECORDED.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT SUCH FUTURE CHARGES, IF ANY, WOULD NOT HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE

COMPANY, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS SIGNIFICANT AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE.

BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND DEVELOPMENTS, THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REEXAMINES ITS

ESTIMATES OF PROBABLE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED EXPENSES AND RECEIVABLES, AND

WHETHER IT IS ABLE TO ESTIMATE A LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED TO BE NOT

ESTIMABLE AND/OR NOT PROBABLE. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANY MAKES ADDITIONS

TO OR ADJUSTMENTS OF ITS ESTIMATED LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, THE CURRENT ESTIMATES

OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION,

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS

PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES INSURANCE RECEIVABLES BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ITS

NUMEROUS POLICIES, INCLUDING THEIR EXCLUSIONS, PERTINENT CASE LAW INTERPRETING

COMPARABLE POLICIES, ITS EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR CLAIMS, AND ASSESSMENT OF THE

NATURE OF THE CLAIM, AND RECORDS AN AMOUNT IT HAS CONCLUDED IS LIKELY TO BE

RECOVERED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS

THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF ON-GOING LITIGATION,

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND OTHER LIABILITIES (AS DEFINED BELOW) FOR WHICH

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE ITS PROBABLE LIABILITY AND FOR WHICH THE

COMPANY HAS TAKEN RESERVES AND THE RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

THE COMPANY RECORDED $40

MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 WITH RESPECT TO THE SETTLEMENT IN

PRINCIPLE REACHED IN THAT QUARTER WITH RESPECT TO THE ANTITRUST CLASS ACTION

BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF DIRECT PURCHASERS WHO DID NOT PURCHASE PRIVATE LABEL TAPE.

FOR THOSE SIGNIFICANT PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE TABLE

AND THAT ARE NOT THE SUBJECT OF PENDING SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS

DETERMINED THAT

LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR

THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, AND THE COMPANY

IS

UNABLE

TO ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS

OR RANGE OF LOSS AT THIS TIME. THE AMOUNTS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WITH RESPECT

TO BREAST IMPLANT AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION REPRESENT THE COMPANYS BEST

ESTIMATE OF THE RESPECTIVE LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE

IS ANY SINGLE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE RESPIRATOR/MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITY OR THE

OTHER LIABILITIES SHOWN ABOVE, NOR THAT IT CAN RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OR

RANGE OF AMOUNTS BY WHICH THOSE LIABILITIES MAY EXCEED THE RESERVES THE COMPANY

HAS ESTABLISHED.

BREAST IMPLANT INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD RECEIVABLES FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED

TO THE BREAST IMPLANT MATTER OF $93 MILLION, REPRESENTING AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO

BE RECOVERED PURSUANT TO THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURTS RULING OF AUGUST 2003

BUT YET TO BE RECEIVED AND OTHER AMOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN CLAIMED FROM VARIOUS

REINSURERS, THE MINNESOTA INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION, AND

THE

ESTATES OF CERTAIN INSOLVENT INSURANCE CARRIERS.

THE COMPANY RECEIVED ABOUT $1 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006 (BRINGING

TOTAL RECOVERIES IN 2006 TO $43 MILLION), PURSUANT TO SETTLEMENTS THAT WERE

CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS OVERALL EXPECTATION OF RECOVERY AS A RESULT OF

THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT RULING. THIS RECOVERY REDUCED THE PREVIOUSLY

RECORDED RECEIVABLE, WHICH WAS SEPARATELY RAISED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER BY $6

MILLION REFLECTING A REVISED ESTIMATE OF LIKELY TOTAL REMAINING RECOVERIES.

WITH THESE RECENT SETTLEMENTS AND THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED SETTLEMENTS, 21 OF

THE 29 INSURERS HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM THE PENDING PROCEEDINGS AND HAVE SETTLED

THE COMPANYS CLAIMS UNDER THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT DECISION. VARIOUS

FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF RECOVERY OF THE BALANCE OF THE

COMPANYS INSURANCE RECEIVABLES, INCLUDING (I) ADDITIONAL DELAYS IN OR

AVOIDANCE OF PAYMENT BY INSURERS; (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH INSURERS MAY BECOME

INSOLVENT IN THE FUTURE, AND (III) THE OUTCOME OF THE PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

INVOLVING THE INSURERS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE DISTRICT COURT IN RAMSEY COUNTY

MINNESOTA WILL ENTER IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 A COMPREHENSIVE ORDER AND

JUDGMENT SETTING FORTH THE AMOUNT (PLUS INTEREST) THAT EACH OF THE INSURERS

REMAINING IN THE CASE OWE THE COMPANY.

RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

THE

COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES, INCLUDING THE COST

TO RESOLVE THE CLAIM AND DEFENSE COSTS, BY EXAMINING: (I) THE COMPANYS

EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING CLAIMS, (II) APPARENT TRENDS, (III) THE APPARENT

QUALITY OF CLAIMS (

E.G.,

WHETHER

THE CLAIM HAS BEEN ASSERTED

ON BEHALF OF

ASYMPTOMATIC CLAIMANTS

), (IV) CHANGES IN THE NATURE AND MIX OF CLAIMS (

E.G.,

THE PROPORTION OF CLAIMS ASSERTING USAGE OF THE

COMPANYS MASK OR RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND ALLEGING EXPOSURE TO EACH OF

ASBESTOS, SILICA, COAL OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS, AND CLAIMS PLEADING USE OF

ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCTS ALLEGEDLY MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY), (V) THE

NUMBER OF CURRENT CLAIMS AND A PROJECTION OF THE NUMBER OF FUTURE ASBESTOS AND

OTHER CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY, (VI) THE COST TO RESOLVE

RECENTLY SETTLED CLAIMS, AND (VII) AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST TO RESOLVE AND

DEFEND AGAINST CURRENT AND FUTURE CLAIMS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN

PROJECTING THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ASSERTED, PARTICULARLY

WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS RESPIRATORY PRODUCTS THAT THEMSELVES DID NOT

CONTAIN ANY HARMFUL MATERIALS (WHICH MAKES THE VARIOUS PUBLISHED STUDIES THAT

PURPORT TO PROJECT FUTURE ASBESTOS CLAIMS SUBSTANTIALLY REMOVED FROM THE

COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXPERIENCE AND WHICH THEMSELVES VARY WIDELY), THE COMPANY

DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY SINGLE BEST ESTIMATE OF THIS LIABILITY, NOR

THAT IT CAN RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OR RANGE OF AMOUNTS BY WHICH THE

LIABILITY MAY EXCEED THE RESERVE THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED.

NO LIABILITY HAS BEEN RECORDED REGARDING

THE

PENDING ACTION BROUGHT BY THE WEST VIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL PREVIOUSLY

DESCRIBED.

DEVELOPMENTS

MAY OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ITS LIABILITIES. THESE

DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN (I) THE

NUMBER OF FUTURE CLAIMS, (II) THE AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS, (III) THE

LEGAL COSTS OF DEFENDING THESE CLAIMS AND IN MAINTAINING TRIAL READINESS, (IV)

CHANGES IN THE MIX AND NATURE OF CLAIMS RECEIVED, (V) TRIAL AND APPELLATE

OUTCOMES, (VI) CHANGES IN THE LAW AND PROCEDURE APPLICABLE TO THESE CLAIMS, AND

(VII) THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER CO-DEFENDANTS AND INSURERS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANYS RECEIVABLE FOR INSURANCE

RECOVERIES RELATED TO THE RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION WAS $380 MILLION.

THE COMPANY COLLECTED $17 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND $75 MILLION IN 2006

FROM SEVERAL OF ITS INSURERS, REDUCING THIS RECEIVABLE BY THAT AMOUNT. WHILE

THE COMPANY HAS SUBSTANTIAL REMAINING CLAIMS-MADE AND OCCURRENCE (PRE-1986)

INSURANCE COVERAGE, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED THIS ADDITIONAL RECEIVABLE

REPRESENTS A LOWER PERCENTAGE OF THE ADDITIONAL LIABILITY THAN WAS THE CASE

WITH RECEIVABLES RECORDED PRIOR TO 2004 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF VARYING DEGREES OF

PRIOR SETTLEMENTS WITH THE COMPANYS INSURERS, INSOLVENCIES OF CERTAIN

INSURERS, UNCERTAINTIES CONCERNING THE PRECISE MANNER OF ASSIGNING PARTICULAR

COSTS TO SPECIFIC POLICIES, POTENTIAL EXHAUSTION OF POLICIES, AND THE TYPES OF

CLAIMS ASSERTED. VARIOUS FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF RECOVERY

OF THIS RECEIVABLE, INCLUDING (I) DELAYS IN OR AVOIDANCE OF PAYMENT BY

INSURERS; (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH INSURERS MAY BECOME INSOLVENT IN THE FUTURE,

AND (III) THE OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH INSURERS AND POSSIBLE LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS, IF NECESSARY, WITH RESPECT TO RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITY

INSURANCE COVERAGE. ON JANUARY 5, 2007 THE COMPANY WAS SERVED WITH A

DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION FILED ON BEHALF OF TWO OF ITS INSURERS (CONTINENTAL

CASUALTY AND CONTINENTAL INSURANCE CO.) DISCLAIMING COVERAGE FOR

75

RESPIRATOR/MASK CLAIMS. THE ACTION WAS FILED IN HENNEPIN COUNTY,

MINNESOTA AND NAMES, IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY, OVER 60 OF THE COMPANYS

INSURERS. THIS ACTION IS SIMILAR IN NATURE TO AN ACTION FILED IN 1994 WITH

RESPECT TO BREAST IMPLANT COVERAGE, WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN THE MINNESOTA

SUPREME COURTS RULING OF 2003 THAT WAS LARGELY IN THE COMPANYS FAVOR.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ACCRUED LIABILITY AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLE

REPRESENTS IN PART THE TIME DELAY BETWEEN PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND RECORDING OF

LIABILITY (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO PROJECTED FUTURE CLAIMS) ON THE ONE HAND

AND RECEIPT OF INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENTS ON THE OTHER HAND. BECAUSE OF THE LAG TIME

BETWEEN SETTLEMENT AND PAYMENT OF A CLAIM, NO MEANINGFUL CONCLUSIONS MAY BE

DRAWN FROM QUARTERLY CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES FOR EXPECTED

INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND THE QUARTERLY CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AT

THE END OF EACH QUARTER.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE

RECEIVABLES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE COMPANY HAD

RECORDED LIABILITIES OF $44 MILLION FOR ESTIMATED ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

COSTS BASED UPON AN EVALUATION OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FACTS WITH RESPECT TO

EACH INDIVIDUAL SITE AND ALSO RECORDED RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES OF $15

MILLION. THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS RESERVES BY $13 MILLION DURING THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2006 FOR ESTIMATED ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS AT ONE OF ITS

EUROPEAN PHARMACEUTICAL PLANTS. THE COMPANY RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION

COSTS ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE,

GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS

COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION. LIABILITIES FOR ESTIMATED COSTS OF

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, DEPENDING ON THE SITE, ARE BASED PRIMARILY UPON

INTERNAL OR THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, AND ESTIMATES AS TO THE NUMBER,

PARTICIPATION LEVEL AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF ANY OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE

PARTIES, THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION AND THE NATURE OF REQUIRED REMEDIAL

ACTIONS. THE COMPANY ADJUSTS RECORDED LIABILITIES AS FURTHER INFORMATION

DEVELOPS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT IT WILL PAY THE

AMOUNTS RECORDED OVER THE PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE APPLICABLE SITES,

CURRENTLY RANGING UP TO 30 YEARS. THE AMOUNTS IN THE ABOVE TABLE DESCRIBED AS OTHER

LIABILITIES INCLUDE THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF FULFILLING THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED

AGREEMENTS WITH THE CITY OF OAKDALE AND LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA, IN ADDRESSING

PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES IN THOSE COMMUNITIES AND IN

ADDRESSING PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS IN THE SOIL AT THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING

FACILITIES IN DECATUR, ALABAMA AND COTTAGE GROVE, MINNESOTA THAT FORMERLY

MANUFACTURED THOSE COMPOUNDS.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND

REMEDIATION GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION AND

ENFORCEMENT OF APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE EXTENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND THE EXISTENCE OF ALTERNATE CLEANUP METHODS.

DEVELOPMENTS MAY OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS CURRENT ASSESSMENT,

INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (I) CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE

REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS;

(II) CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, CHANGES IN PERMISSIBLE LEVELS OF

SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES, OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT

THEORIES AND POLICIES, INCLUDING EFFORTS TO RECOVER NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES;

(III) NEW AND EVOLVING ANALYTICAL AND REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES; (IV) SUCCESS IN

ALLOCATING LIABILITY TO OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES; AND (V) THE

FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND THIRD-PARTY

INDEMNITORS.

CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS.

DURING THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN UNCONDITIONAL AGREEMENT TO

PURCHASE RAW MATERIALS FROM A THIRD-PARTY SUPPLIER. THE AGREEMENT, EFFECTIVE

FROM JANUARY 1, 2007 TO DECEMBER 31, 2009, REQUIRES 3M TO PURCHASE APPROXIMATELY

$200 MILLION OF RAW MATERIALS. THE PURCHASE OBLIGATION AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT

THE ENTIRE ANTICIPATED PURCHASES BY 3M DURING THE CONTRACT PERIOD, BUT

REPRESENT ONLY THOSE ITEMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED.

NOTE 14.

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND STOCK

OWNERSHIP PLANS

THE

COMPANY SPONSORS EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS UNDER SECTION 401(K) OF THE INTERNAL

REVENUE CODE. THESE PLANS ARE OFFERED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL REGULAR U.S.

EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS OF UP TO 6% OF COMPENSATION ARE MATCHED AT

RATES RANGING FROM 35% TO 50%, WITH ADDITIONAL COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS DEPENDING

UPON COMPANY PERFORMANCE. ALL COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS INITIALLY ARE INVESTED IN

3M COMMON STOCK, WITH EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS INVESTED IN A NUMBER OF INVESTMENT

FUNDS PURSUANT TO THEIR ELECTIONS. VESTED EMPLOYEES MAY DIVERSIFY THEIR 3M

SHARES INTO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS.

THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). THIS PLAN WAS

ESTABLISHED IN 1989 AS A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OF FUNDING THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS

CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER 401(K) EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS. TOTAL ESOP SHARES ARE

CONSIDERED TO BE SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS.

DIVIDENDS

ON SHARES HELD BY THE ESOP ARE PAID TO THE ESOP TRUST AND, TOGETHER WITH

COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS, ARE USED BY THE ESOP TO REPAY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON

THE OUTSTANDING ESOP DEBT. THE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO DIVIDENDS PAID ON

UNALLOCATED SHARES WAS CHARGED DIRECTLY TO EQUITY AND TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $3

MILLION IN 2006, $4 MILLION IN 2005, AND $4 MILLION IN 2004. OVER THE LIFE

OF THE ESOP DEBT, SHARES ARE RELEASED FOR ALLOCATION TO PARTICIPANTS BASED ON

THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT YEARS DEBT SERVICE TO THE REMAINING DEBT SERVICE

PRIOR TO THE CURRENT PAYMENT.

76

THE ESOP HAS BEEN THE

PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS. AS PERMITTED

BY AICPA STATEMENT OF POSITION 93-6, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK

OWNERSHIP PLANS, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO CONTINUE ITS PRACTICES, WHICH ARE

BASED ON STATEMENT OF POSITION 76-3, ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE

STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS AND SUBSEQUENT CONSENSUS OF THE EITF OF THE FASB.

ACCORDINGLY, THE DEBT OF THE ESOP IS RECORDED AS DEBT, AND SHARES PLEDGED AS

COLLATERAL ARE REPORTED AS UNEARNED COMPENSATION IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AND CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. UNEARNED COMPENSATION IS REDUCED SYMMETRICALLY AS THE

ESOP MAKES PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON THE DEBT. EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ESOP INCLUDE

TOTAL DEBT SERVICE ON THE NOTES, LESS DIVIDENDS. THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES

TREASURY SHARES, ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, TO EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS TO

COVER OBLIGATIONS NOT FUNDED BY THE ESOP (REPORTED AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

EXPENSE).

IN CONNECTION WITH THE

ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R, IN 2005 THE COMPANY REVIEWED AND UPDATED, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, ITS VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED TERM ASSUMPTIONS. EXPECTED VOLATILITY

IS A STATISTICAL MEASURE OF THE AMOUNT BY WHICH A STOCK PRICE IS EXPECTED TO

FLUCTUATE DURING A PERIOD. FOR THE 2006 AND 2005 ANNUAL GRANT DATE, THE COMPANY

ESTIMATED THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY BASED UPON THE AVERAGE OF THE MOST RECENT ONE

YEAR VOLATILITY, THE MEDIAN OF THE TERM OF THE EXPECTED LIFE ROLLING

VOLATILITY, THE MEDIAN OF THE MOST RECENT TERM OF THE EXPECTED LIFE VOLATILITY

OF 3M STOCK, AND THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY ON THE GRANT DATE. THE EXPECTED TERM

ASSUMPTION IS BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF HISTORICAL GRANTS AND ASSUMING

THAT OPTIONS OUTSTANDING ARE EXERCISED AT THE MIDPOINT OF THE FUTURE REMAINING

TERM.

NOTE 17.

BUSINESS SEGMENTS

3MS BUSINESSES ARE

ORGANIZED, MANAGED AND INTERNALLY GROUPED INTO SEGMENTS BASED ON DIFFERENCES IN

PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES.

3M

MANAGES ITS OPERATIONS IN SIX OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS: INDUSTRIAL AND

TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT, HEALTH CARE SEGMENT, DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT,

CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENT, SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES SEGMENT

AND ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT. 3MS SIX BUSINESS SEGMENTS BRING

TOGETHER COMMON OR RELATED 3M TECHNOLOGIES, ENHANCING THE DEVELOPMENT OF

INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND PROVIDING FOR EFFICIENT SHARING OF

BUSINESS RESOURCES. THESE SEGMENTS HAVE WORLDWIDE RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIRTUALLY

ALL 3M PRODUCT LINES.

3M IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE PRODUCT OR

MARKET.

CERTAIN SMALL BUSINESSES AND

STAFF-SPONSORED PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS CORPORATE ASSETS AND EXPENSES, ARE

NOT ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

TRANSACTIONS AMONG

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE RECORDED AT COST. 3M IS AN INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE

CHARACTERIZED BY SUBSTANTIAL INTERSEGMENT COOPERATION, COST ALLOCATIONS AND

INVENTORY TRANSFERS. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT REPRESENT THAT THESE

SEGMENTS, IF OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY, WOULD REPORT THE OPERATING INCOME AND

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION SHOWN. THE ALLOCATIONS RESULTING FROM THE SHARED

UTILIZATION OF ASSETS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE UNDERLYING ACTIVITY

FOR SEGMENT ASSETS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.
