MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE CONFIDENCE OF WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS, JOBBERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS IN 3M AND ITS PRODUCTS — A CONFIDENCE DEVELOPED THROUGH LONG ASSOCIATION WITH SKILLED MARKETING AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES — HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO 3M’S POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND TO ITS GROWTH.

RESEARCH AND PATENTS

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CONSTITUTES AN IMPORTANT PART OF 3M’S

ACTIVITIES AND HAS BEEN A MAJOR DRIVER OF 3M’S SALES AND PROFIT GROWTH. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES TOTALED $1.7

63

BILLION IN 2015, $1.770 BILLION IN 2014 AND $1.715 BILLION IN 2013. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, COVERING BASIC SCIENTIFIC

RESEARCH AND THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND IMPROVED PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, TOTALED $1.

; INTERNALLY DEVELOPED PATENT COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE COSTS AND FEES INCURRED TO PREPARE, FILE, SECURE AND MAINTAIN PATENTS; AMORTIZATION OF EXTERNALLY ACQUIRED PATENTS AND EXTERNALLY ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; AND GAINS/LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN CORPORATE APPROVED INVESTMENTS IN R&D-RELATED VENTURES, SUCH AS EQUITY METHOD EFFECTS AND IMPAIRMENTS.

THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AROUND THE WORLD UNDER VARIOUS TRADEMARKS. THE COMPANY ALSO OWNS, OR HOLDS LICENSES TO USE, NUMEROUS U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS. THE COMPANY’S RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES GENERATE A STEADY STREAM OF INVENTIONS THAT ARE COVERED BY NEW PATENTS. PATENTS APPLICABLE TO SPECIFIC PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR VARYING PERIODS ACCORDING TO THE DATE OF PATENT APPLICATION FILING OR PATENT GRANT AND THE LEGAL TERM OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION IS OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY A PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN THE COUNTRY.

THE IMPORTANCE OF PATENTS IN THE ELECTRONICS AND ENERGY SEGMENT IS DESCRIBED IN “PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT” — “ELECTRONICS AND ENERGY BUSINESS” IN PART II, ITEM 7, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES HAVE INCLUDED POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICES — SUCH AS WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT IMPROVEMENTS, SCRUBBERS, CONTAINMENT STRUCTURES, SOLVENT RECOVERY UNITS AND THERMAL OXIDIZERS — AT NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES CONSTRUCTED OR UPGRADED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY ASSUMES NO OBLIGATION TO UPDATE OR REVISE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS AND TRENDS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS AND TRENDS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM HISTORICAL RESULTS OR THOSE REFLECTED IN ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS. IMPORTANT INFORMATION AS TO THESE FACTORS CAN BE FOUND IN THIS DOCUMENT, INCLUDING, AMONG OTHERS, “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS” UNDER THE HEADINGS OF “OVERVIEW,” “FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

” AND ANNUALLY IN

“CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES.

”

DISCUSSION OF THESE FACTORS IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE FROM PART I, ITEM 1A, “RISK FACTORS,” OF THIS DOCUMENT, AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED AN INTEGRAL PART OF PART II, ITEM 7, “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.” FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING FACTORS THAT MAY CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO VARY MATERIALLY FROM THOSE STATED IN THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS, SEE OUR REPORTS ON FORM 10-K, 10-Q AND 8-K FILED

WITH THE SEC FROM TIME TO TIME.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTOR

S.

PROVIDED BELOW IS A CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST IMPORTANT RISK FACTORS APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY. DISCUSSION OF THESE FACTORS IS INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO AND CONSIDERED AN INTEGRAL PART OF PART II,

ITEM 7, “MANAGEMENT’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.”

* RESULTS ARE IMPACTED BY THE EFFECTS OF, AND CHANGES IN, WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC

, POLITICAL,

AND CAPITAL MARKETS CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY

OPERATES

IN MORE THAN 70 COUNTRIES AND

DERIVES

APPROXIMATELY 60 PERCENT OF

ITS REVENUES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO GLOBAL COMPETITION

AND GEOPOLITICAL RISKS

AND MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL, SUCH AS

SLOWER ECONOMIC GROWTH,

DISRUPTIONS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS, ECONOMIC DOWNTURNS IN THE FORM OF EITHER CONTAINED OR WIDESPREAD RECESSIONARY

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONDITIONS,

INFLATION,

ELEVATED UNEMPLOYMENT LEVELS, SLUGGISH OR UNEVEN RECOVERY,

GOVERNMENT DEFICIT REDUCTION AND OTHER AUSTERITY MEASURES

IN SPECIFIC COUNTRIES OR REGIONS, OR IN THE VARIOUS INDUSTRIES

IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES; SOCIAL, POLITICAL OR LABOR CONDITIONS IN SPECIFIC COUNTRIES OR REGIONS; NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS

OR CLIMATE CHANGE

AFFECTING THE OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY OR ITS CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS; OR ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL, INTEREST RATES, TAX RATES,

TAX

LAWS,

OR

EXCHANGE CONTROL, ABILITY TO EXPATRIATE EARNINGS AND OTHER

REGULATIONS IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES.

*

CHANGE IN T

HE COMPANY’S CREDIT RATINGS

COULD INCREASE COST OF FUND

ING.

THE COMPANY’S CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO 3M’S COST OF CAPITAL.

THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE THE COMPANY’S CREDIT PROFILE AND ASSIGN DEBT RATINGS TO 3M.

THE COMPANY HAS AN AA- CREDIT RATING, WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK, FROM STANDARD & POOR’S AND AN AA3 CREDIT RATING, WITH A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK, FROM MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE.

THIS EVALUATION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, WHICH INCLUD

E FINANCIAL STRENGTH, BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RISK, AS WELL AS TRANSPARENCY WITH RATING AGENCIES AND TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE COMPANY’S CREDIT RATINGS HAVE

SERVED TO

LOWER

3M’S

BORROWING COSTS AND

FACILITATE

ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF LENDERS.

THE COMPANY’S

ONGOING TRANSITION TO A MORE OPTIMIZED CAPITAL STRUCTURE, FINANCED WITH ADDITIONAL LOW-COST DEBT, COULD IMPACT 3M’S CREDIT RATING IN THE FUTURE. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN STRONG INVESTMENT GRADE RATINGS WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S COST OF FUND

ING

AND COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS.

* THE COMPANY’S RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMER PREFERENCES.

DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS, WHICH IMPACTS REVENUE AND PROFIT MARGINS, IS AFFECTED BY (I) THE DEVELOPMENT AND TIMING OF THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS; (II) THE COMPANY’S RESPONSE TO DOWNWARD PRICING TO STAY COMPETITIVE; (III) CHANGES IN CUSTOMER ORDER PATTERNS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF INVENTORY MAINTAINED BY CUSTOMERS AND THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER PURCHASES WHICH MAY BE AFFECTED BY ANNOUNCED PRICE CHANGES, CHANGES IN THE COMPANY’S INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, OR THE CUSTOMER’S ABILITY TO ACHIEVE INCENTIVE GOALS; AND (IV) CHANGES IN CUSTOMERS’ PREFERENCES FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE SUCCESS OF PRODUCTS OFFERED BY OUR COMPETITORS, AND CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DESIGNS FOR THEIR PRODUCTS THAT CAN AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR SOME OF THE COMPANY’S PRODUCTS.

* FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THOSE RATES MAY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO REALIZE PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN ITS SALES AND EARNINGS.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND APPROXIMATELY

60 PERCENT

OF THE COMPANY’S REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ITS ABILITY TO REALIZE PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN SALES AND EARNINGS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS SIGNIFICANTLY AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES.

* THE COMPANY’S GROWTH OBJECTIVES ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TIMING AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF ITS NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY RENEW ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

THIS ABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW PRODUCTS, OBTAIN ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION, OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT NEW PRODUCTS WILL PROVE TO BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL.

* THE COMPANY’S FUTURE RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COSTS AND AVAILABILITY OF PURCHASED COMPONENTS, COMPOUNDS, RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY, INCLUDING OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES, DUE TO SHORTAGES, INCREASED DEMAND, SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON VARIOUS COMPONENTS, COMPOUNDS, RAW MATERIALS, AND ENERGY (INCLUDING OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES) SUPPLIED BY OTHERS FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF ITS PRODUCTS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ANY OF ITS SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS COULD BE INTERRUPTED DUE TO NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS AND OTHER EVENTS, OR BE TERMINATED IN THE FUTURE. ANY SUSTAINED INTERRUPTION IN THE COMPANY’S RECEIPT OF ADEQUATE SUPPLIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, WHILE THE COMPANY HAS A PROCESS TO MINIMIZE VOLATILITY IN COMPONENT AND MATERIAL PRICING, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS OR THAT FUTURE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS OR SHORTAGES WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

* ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER UNUSUAL EVENTS RESULTING FROM PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AND OTHER EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, AND POSSIBLE ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.

THE COMPANY MONITORS ITS BUSINESS PORTFOLIO AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND HAS MADE AND MAY CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, DIVESTITURES AND CHANGES TO ITS ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE. WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS,

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO INTEGRATE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES QUICKLY AND OBTAIN THE ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES.

* THE COMPANY’S FUTURE RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF THE COMPANY GENERATES FEWER PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS THAN ESTIMATED.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES VARIOUS TOOLS, SUCH AS LEAN SIX SIGMA,

AND ENGAGES IN ONGOING GLOBAL BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION

. BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION

IS DEFINED AS

CHANGES IN PROCESSES AND INTERNAL/EXTERNAL SERVICE DELIVERY ACROSS 3M TO MOVE TO MORE EFFICIENT BUSINESS MODEL

S

TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY, WHILE ALLOWING

3M

TO SERVE CUSTOMERS WITH GREATER SPEED AND EFFICIENCY. THIS IS ENABLED BY

THE ONGOING MULTI-YEAR PHASED IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP) SYSTEM ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS.

THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ALL OF THE PROJECTED PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE REALIZED.

* THE COMPANY EMPLOYS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS TO SUPPORT ITS BUSINESS, INCLUDING ONGOING PHASED IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ERP SYSTEM

AS PART OF BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION

ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. SECURITY BREACHES AND OTHER DISRUPTIONS TO THE COMPANY’S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INFRASTRUCTURE COULD INTERFERE WITH THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS, COMPROMISE INFORMATION BELONGING TO THE COMPANY AND ITS CUSTOMERS

,

SUPPLIERS

, AND EMPLOYEES, EXPOSING THE COMPANY TO LIABILITY WHICH COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS AND REPUTATION.

IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, THE COMPANY RELIES ON INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH ARE MANAGED BY THIRD PARTIES, TO PROCESS, TRANSMIT AND STORE ELECTRONIC INFORMATION, AND TO MANAGE OR SUPPORT A VARIETY OF BUSINESS PROCESSES AND ACTIVITIES. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY COLLECTS AND STORES CERTAIN DATA, INCLUDING PROPRIETARY BUSINESS INFORMATION, AND MAY HAVE ACCESS TO CONFIDENTIAL OR PERSONAL INFORMATION IN CERTAIN OF OUR BUSINESSES THAT IS SUBJECT TO PRIVACY AND SECURITY LAWS, REGULATIONS AND CUSTOMER-IMPOSED CONTROLS. DESPITE OUR CYBERSECURITY MEASURES (INCLUDING EMPLOYEE AND THIRD-PARTY TRAINING, MONITORING OF NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS, AND MAINTENANCE OF BACKUP AND PROTECTIVE SYSTEMS) WHICH ARE CONTINUOUSLY REVIEWED AND UPGRADED, THE COMPANY’S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY NETWORKS AND INFRASTRUCTURE MAY STILL BE VULNERABLE TO DAMAGE, DISRUPTIONS OR SHUTDOWNS DUE TO ATTACK BY HACKERS OR BREACHES, EMPLOYEE ERROR OR MALFEASANCE, POWER OUTAGES, COMPUTER VIRUSES, TELECOMMUNICATION OR UTILITY FAILURES, SYSTEMS FAILURES, SERVICE PROVIDERS INCLUDING CLOUD SERVICES, NATURAL DISASTERS OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENTS. IT IS POSSIBLE FOR SUCH VULNERABILITIES TO REMAIN UNDETECTED FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD, UP TO AND INCLUDING SEVERAL YEARS. WHILE WE

HAVE EXPERIENCED, AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE, THESE TYPES OF THREATS TO THE COMPANY’S INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY NETWORKS AND INFRASTRUCTURE, NONE OF THEM TO DATE HAS HAD A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE COMPANY. THERE MAY BE OTHER CHALLENGES AND RISKS AS THE COMPANY UPGRADES AND STANDARDIZES ITS ERP SYSTEM ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS. ANY SUCH EVENTS COULD RESULT IN LEGAL CLAIMS OR PROCEEDINGS, LIABILITY OR PENALTIES UNDER PRIVACY LAWS, DISRUPTION IN OPERATIONS, AND DAMAGE TO THE COMPANY’S REPUTATION, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY MAINTAINS INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR VARIOUS CYBERSECURITY RISKS, THERE CAN BE NO GUARANTEE THAT ALL COSTS OR LOSSES INCURRED WILL BE FULLY INSURED.

* THE COMPANY'S DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS ARE SUBJECT TO FINANCIAL MARKET RISKS THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR RESULTS.

THE PERFORMANCE OF FINANCIAL MARKETS AND DISCOUNT RATES IMPACT THE COMPANY'S FUNDING OBLIGATIONS UNDER ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS. SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN MARKET INTEREST RATES, DECREASES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AND INVESTMENT LOSSES ON PLAN ASSETS, AND RELEVANT LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY CHANGES RELATING TO DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN FUNDING MAY INCREASE THE COMPANY'S FUNDING OBLIGATIONS AND ADVERSELY IMPACT ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS.

* THE COMPANY’S FUTURE RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS AND LEGAL COMPLIANCE RISKS, INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING PRODUCT LIABILITY, ANTITRUST,

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY,

ENVIRONMENTAL, THE U.S. FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND OTHER ANTI-BRIBERY, ANTI-CORRUPTION, OR OTHER MATTERS.

THE OUTCOME OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY DIFFER FROM THE COMPANY’S EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE THE OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION, INCLUDING REGULATORY MATTERS, ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO RELIABLY PREDICT. VARIOUS FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN LEAD THE COMPANY TO CHANGE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES AND RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES WHERE APPLICABLE, OR MAKE SUCH ESTIMATES FOR MATTERS PREVIOUSLY NOT SUSCEPTIBLE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES, SUCH AS A SIGNIFICANT JUDICIAL RULING OR JUDGMENT, A SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT, SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A FUTURE ADVERSE RULING, SETTLEMENT OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD.

YEAR-ON-YEAR COST DECREASES IN MANY FEEDSTOCK CATEGORIES, INCLUDING PETROLEUM BASED MATERIALS, MINERALS, METALS AND WOOD PULP BASED PRODUCTS.

TO DATE THE COMPANY IS RECEIVING SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF ALL RAW MATERIALS TO MEET ITS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT FUTURE SHORTAGES OF RAW MATERIALS OR THE IMPACT ANY SUCH SHORTAGES WOULD HAVE. 3M HAS AVOIDED DISRUPTION TO ITS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS THROUGH CAREFUL MANAGEMENT OF EXISTING RAW MATERIAL INVENTORIES AND DEVELOPMENT AND QUALIFICATION OF ADDITIONAL SUPPLY SOURCES. 3M MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT DEFINED BENEFIT

/CONTRIBUTION

PLANS.

ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS, 3M’S PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS WERE 86 PERCENT FUNDED AT YEAR-END 2015. THE PRIMARY U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 69 PERCENT OF THE WORLDWIDE PENSION OBLIGATION, WAS 91 PERCENT FUNDED AND THE INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS WERE 90 PERCENT FUNDED. THE U.S. NON-QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN IS NOT FUNDED DUE TO TAX CONSIDERATIONS AND OTHER FACTORS. ASSET RETURNS IN 2015 FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN WAS 0.7%, AS 3M STRATEGICALLY INVESTS IN BOTH GROWTH ASSETS AND FIXED INCOME MATCHING ASSETS TO MANAGE ITS FUNDED STATUS. FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS FOR 2016 IS 7.50%, DOWN 0.25% FROM 2015. THE PRIMARY U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN YEAR-END 2015 DISCOUNT RATE WAS 4.47%, UP 0.37 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM THE YEAR-END 2014 DISCOUNT RATE OF 4.10%. THE INCREASE IN U.S. DISCOUNT RATES RESULTED IN A DECREASED VALUATION OF THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION (PBO), HOWEVER THE PLAN’S FUNDED STATUS DECREASED SLIGHTLY IN 2015 AS THE GROWTH IN THE PBO INCREASED AT A GREATER RATE THAN THE PLAN ASSETS RETURNED IN 2015. ADDITIONAL DETAIL AND DISCUSSION OF INTERNATIONAL PLAN ASSET RETURNS AND DISCOUNT RATES IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 11 (PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS).

3M EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION TO $200 MILLION OF CASH TO ITS GLOBAL DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IN 2016. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED MINIMUM CASH PENSION CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2016. 3M EXPECTS GLOBAL DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE IN 2016 (BEFORE SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS, SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER) TO DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $320 MILLION PRE-TAX WHEN COMPARED TO 2015. REFER TO “CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES” WITHIN MD&A AND NOTE 11 (PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS) FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING 3M’S PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT PLANS.

BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2016,

WITH RESPECT TO DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS,

THE COMPANY REDUCED ITS MATCH ON EMPLOYEE 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS

FOR U.S. EMPLOYEES

. PREVIOUSLY, BASED ON THE DATE THE EMPLOYEE WAS HIRED, UP TO 6% OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION WAS MATCHED IN CASH AT RATES OF 60%, 75% OR 100%. BEGINNING IN 2016, 5% OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION WILL BE MATCHED AT RATES OF 45%, 60% OR 100%, RESPECTIVELY. THE REDUCTION IN THE COMPANY’S MATCH IS ANTICIPATED TO REDUCE 2016 DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $35 MILLION.

THE COMPANY IS INVESTING IN BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION. BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION IS DEFINED AS CHANGES IN PROCESSES AND INTERNAL/EXTERNAL SERVICE DELIVERY ACROSS 3M TO MOVE TO MORE EFFICIENT BUSINESS MODEL

S

TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY, WHILE ALLOWING 3M TO SERVE CUSTOMERS WITH GREATER SPEED AND EFFICIENCY. THIS IS ENABLED BY THE ONGOING MULTI-YEAR PHASED IMPLEMENTATION OF AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (ERP) SYSTEM ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS.

COST OF SALES.

COST OF SALES INCLUDES MANUFACTURING, ENGINEERING AND FREIGHT COSTS.

COST OF SALES, MEASURED AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, WAS 50.9 PERCENT IN 2015, A DECREASE OF 0.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 2014. COST OF SALES AS A PERCENT OF SALES DECREASED DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF SELLING PRICE INCREASES AND RAW MATERIAL COST DECREASES, AS SELLING PRICES INCREASED NET SALES BY 1.1 PERCENT AND RAW MATERIAL COST DEFLATION WAS FAVORABLE BY APPROXIMATELY 3.5 PERCENT YEAR-ON-YEAR. IN ADDITION, HIGHER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT COSTS (OF WHICH A PORTION IMPACTS COST OF SALES) AND FOURTH QUARTER 2015 RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, INCREASED COST OF SALES AS A PERCENT OF SALES.

COST OF SALES, MEASURED AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, WAS 51.7 PERCENT IN 2014, A DECREASE OF 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 2013. COST OF SALES AS A PERCENT OF SALES DECREASED DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF SELLING PRICE INCREASES AND RAW MATERIAL COST DECREASES, AS SELLING PRICES INCREASED NET SALES BY 1.0 PERCENT AND RAW MATERIAL COST DEFLATION WAS FAVORABLE BY APPROXIMATELY 1.5 PERCENT YEAR-ON-YEAR. IN ADDITION, LOWER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT COSTS (OF WHICH A PORTION IMPACTS COST OF SALES), ALONG WITH ORGANIC VOLUME LEVERAGE, DECREASED COST OF SALES AS A PERCENT OF SALES.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A) DECREASED $287 MILLION, OR 4.4 PERCENT, IN 2015 WHEN COMPARED TO 2014. THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS REDUCED SG&A EXPENSE, AS EVIDENCED BY OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION IMPACT WHICH REDUCED WORLDWIDE SALES BY

6.

8

PERCENT. THIS FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION BENEFIT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AND FOURTH QUARTER 2015 RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. SG&A, MEASURED AS A PERCENT OF SALES, INCREASED 0.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 20.4 PERCENT IN 2015, COMPARED TO 20.3 PERCENT OF SALES IN 2014.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES (SG&A) INCREASED $85 MILLION, OR 1.3 PERCENT, IN 2014 WHEN COMPARED TO 2013. YEAR 2014 INCLUDED STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS IN BUSINESS TRANSFORMATION, WHILE LOWER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE BENEFITTED SG&A. SG&A, MEASURED AS A PERCENT OF SALES, DECREASED 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 20.3 PERCENT IN 2014, COMPARED TO 20.7 PERCENT OF SALES IN 2013.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES (R&D) DECREASED $7 MILLION, OR 0.4 PERCENT, IN 2015 COMPARED TO 2014. R&D INCREASED 3.2 PERCENT IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013. 3M CONTINUED TO SUPPORT ITS KEY GROWTH INITIATIVES, INCLUDING MORE R&D AIMED AT DISRUPTIVE INNOVATION, WHICH REFERS TO INNOVATION WHICH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO CREATE NEW MARKETS AND DISRUPT EXISTING MARKETS. IN 2015, LIKE SG&A, R&D SPENDING IN U.S. DOLLARS WAS REDUCED DUE TO THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS. THESE 2015 TRANSLATION BENEFITS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE IN 2015 WHEN COMPARED TO 2014. IN 2014, INCREASES IN R&D, WHEN COMPARED TO 2013, WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE. R&D, MEASURED AS A PERCENT OF SALES, WAS 5.8 PERCENT IN 2015, COMPARED TO 5.6 PERCENT IN BOTH 2014 AND 2013.

. CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED INCLUDES A VARIETY OF MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS, SUCH AS CORPORATE INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, CERTAIN DERIVATIVE GAINS AND LOSSES, CERTAIN INSURANCE-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES, CERTAIN LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES, CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND CERTAIN UNDER- OR OVER-ABSORBED COSTS (E.G. PENSION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION) THAT THE COMPANY

DETERMINES

NOT TO ALLOCATE DIRECTLY TO ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. BECAUSE THIS CATEGORY INCLUDES A VARIETY OF MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS, IT IS SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION ON A QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL BASIS.

CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED OPERATING EXPENSES INCREASED BY $104 MILLION IN 2015 WHEN COMPARED TO 2014. THIS INCREASE WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES, WHICH INCREASED IN TOTAL BY $165 MILLION. OF THIS INCREASE, $153 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED. INCREASES WERE ALSO DRIVEN BY FOURTH QUARTER 2015 RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $37 MILLION, AS INDICATED IN THE BELOW TABLE. ITEMS WHICH PARTIALLY OFFSET THESE INCREASES WITHIN CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED INCLUDED HIGHER ADMINISTRATIVE AND R&D

COST ABSORPTION BY

THE FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS, RESULTING IN LESS

UNDER-ABSORBED

EXPENSE BEING ALLOCATED TO CORPORATE.

CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED OPERATING EXPENSES DECREASED BY $70 MILLION IN 2014 WHEN COMPARED TO 2013. THIS DECREASE WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT EXPENSES, WHICH DECLINED YEAR-ON-YEAR BY $162 MILLION. OF THIS REDUCTION, $116 MILLION WAS ALLOCATED TO CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED EXPENSES RELATED TO YEAR-ON-YEAR INCREASES IN ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN EXPENSES AND LEGAL ACCRUALS.

PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA

WHILE 3M MANAGES ITS BUSINESSES GLOBALLY AND BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS ARE THE MOST RELEVANT MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA AS A SECONDARY PERFORMANCE MEASURE. EXPORT SALES ARE GENERALLY REPORTED WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WHERE THE FINAL SALES TO 3M CUSTOMERS ARE MADE. A PORTION OF THE PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS SOLD BY 3M’S OPERATIONS TO ITS CUSTOMERS ARE EXPORTED BY THESE CUSTOMERS TO DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AS CUSTOMERS MOVE THEIR OPERATIONS FROM ONE GEOGRAPHIC AREA TO ANOTHER, 3M’S RESULTS WILL FOLLOW. THUS, NET SALES IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF END-USER CONSUMPTION IN THAT GEOGRAPHIC AREA. FINANCIAL INFORMATION RELATED TO 3M OPERATIONS IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 1

CAPITAL SPENDING/NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ENABLE GROWTH ACROSS MANY DIVERSE MARKETS, HELPING TO MEET PRODUCT DEMAND AND INCREASING MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY. 3M’S CAPITAL SPENDING BY GEOGRAPHY HAS BEEN LED BY THE UNITED STATES (6

4% OF SPENDING IN 201

), FOLLOWED BY EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA, ASIA PACIFIC, AND LATIN AMERICA/CANADA. 3M IS CONTINUING TO INCREASE ITS MANUFACTURING AND SOURCING CAPABILITY, PARTICULARLY IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES, IN ORDER TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN ITS PRODUCT CAPABILITY WITH ITS SALES IN MAJOR GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. 3M WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN CRITICAL DEVELOPING MARKETS, SUCH

AS BRAZIL, CHINA, MEXICO, PANAMA, POLAND, SOUTHEAST ASIA, AND TURKEY.

CAPITAL SPENDING IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL LATER IN MD&A IN THE SECTION ENTITLED “CASH FLOWS FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES.”

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

INFORMATION REGARDING SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 1. AS STATED IN NOTE 1, THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES RELATE TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, THE COMPANY’S PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND INCOME TAXES. SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT, SELECTION AND DISCLOSURE OF ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF 3M’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE CATEGORIES OF CLAIMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS A PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE LIABILITY, THE AMOUNT OF ITS LIABILITY ACCRUALS, AND THE ESTIMATES OF ITS RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES ARE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. PLEASE REFER TO THE SECTION ENTITLED “PROCESS FOR DISCLOSURE AND RECORDING OF LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS” (CONTAINED IN “LEGAL PROCEEDINGS” IN NOTE 1

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

3M HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE PRIMARY U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLAN WAS CLOSED TO NEW PARTICIPANTS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PLANS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARD CODIFICATION (ASC) 715,

COMPENSATION — RETIREMENT BENEFITS

, IN MEASURING PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST. ASC 715 REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO RECOGNIZE THE UNDERFUNDED OR OVERFUNDED STATUS OF A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION OR POSTRETIREMENT PLAN AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FUNDED STATUS IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH IS A COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS’ EQUITY. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE VALUATION METHODS USED TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE USE OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE. SEE NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES.

PENSION BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANS ARE GENERALLY BASED PRIMARILY ON EACH PARTICIPANT’S YEARS OF SERVICE, COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION REPRESENTS THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE BENEFITS THAT EMPLOYEES ARE ENTITLED TO IN THE FUTURE FOR SERVICES ALREADY RENDERED AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE COMPANY MEASURES THE PRESENT VALUE OF THESE FUTURE BENEFITS BY PROJECTING BENEFIT PAYMENT CASH FLOWS FOR EACH FUTURE PERIOD AND DISCOUNTING THESE CASH FLOWS BACK TO THE DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE, USING THE YIELDS OF A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY, FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD PRODUCE CASH FLOWS SUFFICIENT IN TIMING AND AMOUNT TO SETTLE PROJECTED FUTURE BENEFITS. HISTORICALLY, THE SINGLE AGGREGATED DISCOUNT RATE USED FOR EACH PLAN

USED FOR THE CALCULATION OF ALL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS, INCLUDING THE MEASUREMENT OF THE SERVICE AND

INTEREST COSTS. BEGINNING IN 2016, 3M CHANGE

D

THE METHOD USED TO ESTIMATE THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF THE NET PERIODIC PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS. THE NEW METHOD MEASURES SERVICE COST AND INTEREST COST SEPARATELY USING THE SPOT YIELD CURVE APPROACH APPLIED TO EACH CORRESPONDING OBLIGATION. SERVICE COSTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DURATION-SPECIFIC SPOT RATES APPLIED TO THE SERVICE COST CASH FLOWS. THE INTEREST COST CALCULATION IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING DURATION-SPECIFIC SPOT RATES TO THE YEAR-BY-YEAR PROJECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS. THE SPOT YIELD CURVE APPROACH DOES NOT AFFECT THE MEASUREMENT OF THE TOTAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS THE CHANGE IN SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS OFFSET IN THE ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY CHANG

ED

TO THE NEW METHOD TO PROVIDE A MORE PRECISE MEASURE OF SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS BY IMPROVING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE PROJECTED BENEFIT CASH FLOWS AND THE DISCRETE SPOT YIELD CURVE RATES. THE COMPANY ACCOUNT

ED

FOR THIS CHANGE AS A CHANGE IN ESTIMATE PROSPECTIVELY BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016. AS A RESULT OF THE CHANGE TO THE SPOT YIELD CURVE APPROACH, 2016 DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE BY $180 MILLION. INCLUDING THIS $180 MILLION, 3M EXPECTS GLOBAL DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE IN 2016 (BEFORE SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS, SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER) TO DECREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $320 MILLION PRE-TAX WHEN COMPARED TO 2015.

SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT IN DETERMINING THE COMPANY’S PENSION EXPENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 715 IS THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, WHICH IS BASED ON HISTORICAL RESULTS FOR SIMILAR ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS FOR 2016 IS 7.50%, 0.25% LOWER THAN 2015. REFER TO NOTE 11 FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THE 2015 RATE WAS DETERMINED. RETURN ON ASSETS ASSUMPTIONS FOR

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE CALCULATED ON A PLAN-BY-PLAN BASIS USING PLAN ASSET ALLOCATIONS AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTIONS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED RETURN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLAN IS 5.77% FOR 2016, COMPARED TO 5.90% FOR 2015.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED TOTAL CONSOLIDATED DEFINED BENEFIT PRE-TAX PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE (AFTER SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS, SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER) OF $55

6

MILLION, UP FROM $391 MILLION IN 2014. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE (BEFORE SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS, SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER) IS ANTICIPATED TO DECREASE TO APPROXIMATELY $236

MILLION IN 2016, A DECREASE OF $320 MILLION COMPARED TO 2015.

AS OF

, NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT TOTALED

$8.5 BILLION

AND NET IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS TOTALED $2.6

BILLION. MANAGEMENT MAKES ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR WHICH ACTUAL RESULTS WILL EMERGE OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THIS INCLUDES THE RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EMPLOYED IN THE BUSINESS, INCLUDING ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE CLOSELY MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND PERIODICALLY ADJUSTED AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. FOR INSTANCE, EXPECTED ASSET LIVES MAY BE SHORTENED OR AN IMPAIRMENT RECORDED BASED ON A CHANGE IN THE EXPECTED USE OF THE ASSET OR PERFORMANCE OF THE RELATED ASSET GROUP.

3M GOODWILL TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $9.2

BILLION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

. 3M’S ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TESTING IS PERFORMED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR. IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR GOODWILL IS DONE AT A REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, WITH ALL GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO A REPORTING UNIT. REPORTING UNITS ARE ONE LEVEL BELOW THE BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL, BUT CAN BE COMBINED WHEN REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE SAME SEGMENT HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. AT 3M, REPORTING UNITS GENERALLY CORRESPOND TO A DIVISION. 3M DID NOT COMBINE ANY OF ITS REPORTING UNITS FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING.

AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS GENERALLY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S NET ASSETS EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED USING EARNINGS FOR

THE REPORTING UNIT MULTIPLIED BY A PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO FOR COMPARABLE INDUSTRY GROUPS, OR BY USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. 3M TYPICALLY USES THE PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO APPROACH FOR STABLE AND GROWING BUSINESSES THAT HAVE A LONG HISTORY AND TRACK RECORD OF GENERATING POSITIVE OPERATING INCOME AND CASH FLOWS. 3M USES THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW APPROACH FOR START-UP, LOSS POSITION AND DECLINING BUSINESSES,

IN ADDITION TO BUSINESSES WHERE THE PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO VALUATION METHOD INDICATES ADDITIONAL REVIEW IS WARRANTED. 3M

ALSO USES DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW AS AN ADDITIONAL TOOL FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY BE GROWING AT A SLOWER RATE THAN PLANNED DUE TO ECONOMIC OR OTHER CONDITIONS.

AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 16, EFFECTIVE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2015, WITHIN THE HEALTH CARE BUSINESS SEGMENT, THE COMPANY FORMED THE ORAL CARE SOLUTIONS DIVISION, WHICH COMBINED THE FORMER 3M ESPE AND 3M UNITEK DIVISIONS.

FOR

ANY PRODUCT MOVES THAT RESULTED IN REPORTING UNIT CHANGES, THE COMPANY APPLIED THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE METHOD TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT ON GOODWILL OF THE ASSOCIATED REPORTING UNITS. DURING THE

THIRD

QUARTER OF 201

5

, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ASSESSMENT OF ANY POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR REPORTING UNITS IMPACTED BY THIS NEW STRUCTURE AND DETERMINED THAT NO IMPAIRMENT EXISTED. THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS RELATES TO THE SEPARATE FOURTH QUARTER 201

5

ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST AND IS IN THE CONTEXT OF THE REPORTING UNIT STRUCTURE THAT EXISTED AT THAT TIME.

AS OF OCTOBER 1, 2015, 3M HAD 26 PRIMARY REPORTING UNITS, WITH TEN REPORTING UNITS ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 87 PERCENT OF THE GOODWILL. THESE TEN REPORTING UNITS WERE COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING DIVISIONS: 3M

P

URIFICATION (WHICH

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCLUDES THE POLYPORE SEPARATIONS MEDIA ACQUISITION), ADVANCED MATERIALS, COMMUNICATION MARKETS, DISPLAY MATERIALS AND SYSTEMS, HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS, INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES AND TAPES, INFECTION PREVENTION, ORAL CARE SOLUTIONS, PERSONAL SAFETY (WHICH INCLUDES THE CAPITAL SAFETY ACQUISITION), AND TRAFFIC SAFETY AND SECURITY. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES FOR THESE REPORTING UNITS WERE IN EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT OR MORE, EXCEPT FOR ONE REPORTING UNIT WITH APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION OF GOODWILL, WHERE THE FAIR VALUE EXCEEDED THE CARRYING VALUE BY APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT. 3M’S MARKET VALUE AT BOTH SEPTEMBER 30, 2015, AND DECEMBER 31, 2015, WAS SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF ITS EQUITY OF APPROXIMATELY $12 BILLION AT BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2015.

IN 2015, 3M PRIMARILY USED AN INDUSTRY PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO APPROACH, BUT ALSO USED A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS APPROACH FOR CERTAIN REPORTING UNITS, TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUES. WHERE APPLICABLE, 3M USED A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS FOR CERTAIN DIVISIONS, USING PROJECTED CASH FLOWS THAT WERE WEIGHTED BASED ON DIFFERENT SALES GROWTH AND TERMINAL VALUE ASSUMPTIONS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS. THE WEIGHTING WAS BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S ESTIMATES OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF EACH SCENARIO OCCURRING.

3M IS AN INTEGRATED MATERIALS ENTERPRISE, THUS MANY OF 3M’S BUSINESSES COULD NOT EASILY BE SOLD ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. 3M’S FOCUS ON RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAS RESULTED IN A PORTION OF 3M’S VALUE BEING COMPRISED OF INTERNALLY DEVELOPED BUSINESSES THAT HAVE NO GOODWILL ASSOCIATED WITH THEM. BASED ON THE ANNUAL TEST IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015, NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS INDICATED FOR ANY OF THE REPORTING UNITS.

FACTORS WHICH COULD RESULT IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES INCLUDE, AMONG OTHERS, CHANGES IN WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMER PREFERENCES, AND FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE RISK FACTORS ARE DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1A, “RISK FACTORS,” OF THIS DOCUMENT. IN ADDITION, CHANGES IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL COULD ALSO IMPACT IMPAIRMENT TESTING RESULTS. AS INDI

CATED ABOVE, DURING THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 201

5

, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ASSESSMENT OF ANY POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR REPORTING UNITS IMPACTED BY CHANGES BETWEEN REPORTING UNITS AND DETERMINED THAT NO IMPAIRMENT EXISTED. LONG-LIVED ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET (ASSET GROUP) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF FUTURE NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE TAKEN, 3M WOULD EXPECT THAT ONLY A PORTION OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS OR GOODWILL WOULD BE IMPAIRED. 3M WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS REPORTING UNITS AND ASSET GROUPS IN 201

6

FOR ANY TRIGGERING EVENTS OR OTHER INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT.

INCOME TAXES.

THE EXTENT OF 3M’S OPERATIONS INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX REGULATIONS IN A MULTITUDE OF JURISDICTIONS. THE FINAL TAXES PAID ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS WITH TAXING AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARISING FROM FEDERAL, STATE, AND INTERNATIONAL TAX AUDITS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES POTENTIAL LIABILITIES AND RECORDS TAX LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED TAX AUDIT ISSUES IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS BASED ON ITS ESTIMATE OF WHETHER, AND THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAXES WILL BE DUE. THE COMPANY FOLLOWS GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY ASC 740,

INCOME TAXES

, REGARDING UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES, TO RECORD THESE LIABILITIES (REFER TO NOTE 8 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION). THE COMPANY ADJUSTS THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES; HOWEVER, DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF SOME OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION MAY RESULT IN A PAYMENT THAT IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE COMPANY’S CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE TAX LIABILITIES. IF THE COMPANY’S ESTIMATE OF TAX LIABILITIES PROVES TO BE LESS THAN THE ULTIMATE ASSESSMENT, AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO EXPENSE WOULD RESULT. IF PAYMENT OF THESE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY PROVES TO BE LESS THAN THE RECORDED AMOUNTS, THE REVERSAL OF THE LIABILITIES WOULD RESULT IN TAX BENEFITS BEING RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE LIABILITIES ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

3M CONTINUES

ITS TRANSITION TO A BETTER-OPTIMIZED

CAPITAL STRUCTURE

AND IS ADDING

LEVERAGE AT A MEASURED PACE. THE STRENGTH AND STABILITY OF 3M'S BUSINESS MODEL AND STRONG FREE CASH FLOW CAPABILITY, TOGETHER WITH PROVEN CAPITAL MARKETS ACCESS, ENABLE

THE COMPANY TO IMPLEMENT THIS STRATEGY.

INVESTING IN 3M’S BUSINESSES TO DRIVE ORGANIC GROWTH REMAINS THE FIRST PRIORITY, THUS 3M WILL CONTINUE TO DEPLOY CAPITAL TOWARDS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, AND COMMERCIALIZATION CAPABILITY. INVESTMENT IN ORGANIC GROWTH WILL BE SUPPLEMENTED BY COMPLEMENTARY ACQUISITIONS. 3M WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO RETURN CASH TO SHAREHOLDERS THROUGH DIVIDENDS AND SHARE REPURCHASES. SOURCES FOR

CASH AVAILABILITY IN THE UNITED STATES, SUCH AS ONGOING CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS, HAVE HISTORICALLY BEEN SUFFICIENT TO FUND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS TO SHAREHOLDERS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, AS WELL AS FUNDING U.S. ACQUISITIONS AND OTHER ITEMS AS NEEDED. FOR THOSE INTERNATIONAL EARNINGS CONSIDERED TO BE REINVESTED INDEFINITELY, THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS NO PLANS OR INTENTIONS TO REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS FOR U.S. OPERATIONS. HOWEVER, IF THESE INTERNATIONAL FUNDS ARE NEEDED FOR OPERATIONS IN THE U.S., 3M WOULD BE REQUIRED TO ACCRUE AND PAY U.S. TAXES TO REPATRIATE THEM. SEE NOTE

8

FOR FURTHER INFORMATION ON EARNINGS CONSIDERED TO BE REINVESTED INDEFINITELY.

3M’S PRIMARY SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARE MET THROUGH CASH ON HAND AND U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES.

THE COMPANY

BELIEVES IT WILL HAVE CONTINUOUS ACCESS TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET. 3M’S COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM PERMITS THE COMPANY TO HAVE A MAXIMUM OF $3 BILLION OUTSTANDING WITH A MAXIMUM MATURITY OF 397 DAYS FROM DATE OF ISSUANCE.

NET DEBT.

THE COMPANY DEFINES NET DEBT AS TOTAL DEBT LESS THE TOTAL OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES. 3M CONSIDERS NET DEBT AND ITS COMPONENTS TO BE AN IMPORTANT INDICATOR OF LIQUIDITY AND A GUIDING MEASURE OF CAPITAL STRUCTURE STRATEGY. NET DEBT IS NOT DEFINED UNDER U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND MAY NOT BE COMPUTED THE SAME AS SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.

INCLUDED IN THE UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS CATEGORY ABOVE ARE CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO TAKE OR PAY CONTRACTS, CAPITAL COMMITMENTS, SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND UTILITIES. THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE BOTH UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH TERMS IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR AND NORMAL ONGOING PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH TERMS OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR. MANY OF THESE COMMITMENTS RELATE TO TAKE OR PAY CONTRACTS, IN WHICH 3M GUARANTEES PAYMENT TO ENSURE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT ARE SOLD TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE CONSIDERATION (PRODUCTS OR SERVICES) FOR THESE UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS. CONTRACTUAL CAPITAL COMMITMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE, BUT THESE COMMITMENTS REPRESENT A SMALL PART OF THE COMPANY’S EXPECTED CAPITAL SPENDING IN

2016

AND BEYOND. THE PURCHASE OBLIGATION AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE ENTIRE ANTICIPATED PURCHASES IN THE FUTURE, BUT REPRESENT ONLY THOSE ITEMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED. THE MAJORITY OF 3M’S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PURCHASED AS NEEDED, WITH NO UNCONDITIONAL COMMITMENT. FOR THIS REASON, THESE AMOUNTS WILL NOT PROVIDE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY’S EXPECTED FUTURE CASH OUTFLOWS ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.

OTHER OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WITHIN THE CAPTION ENTITLED “UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER,” INCLUDE THE CURRENT PORTION OF THE LIABILITY FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS UNDER ASC 740, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE PAID

OUT IN CASH IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF THE LONG-TERM PAYMENTS OR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE LIABILITY WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE OVER TIME; THEREFORE, THE LONG-TERM PORTION OF THE NET TAX LIABILITY OF $208

MILLION IS EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING TABLE. REFER TO NOTE

UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY AGREES TO EXCHANGE, AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND FLOATING INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AN AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

IN THE CONTEXT OF ITEM 7A, 3M IS EXPOSED TO MARKET RISK DUE TO THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. CHANGES IN THOSE FACTORS COULD CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN EARNINGS AND CASH FLOWS. SENIOR MANAGEMENT PROVIDES OVERSIGHT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES, DETERMINES CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL RISK POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES, AND PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT UTILIZATION. SENIOR MANAGEMENT ALSO ESTABLISHES CERTAIN ASSOCIATED PROCEDURES RELATIVE TO CONTROL AND VALUATION, RISK ANALYSIS, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL, AND ONGOING MONITORING AND REPORTING.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES IN INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS, COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS, AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY’S RISK IS LIMITED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH THE USE OF CREDIT APPROVALS AND CREDIT LIMITS, AND BY SELECTING MAJOR INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES.

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES RISK.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THOSE RATES MAY AFFECT THE COMPANY’S NET INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND MAY CAUSE FLUCTUATIONS IN CASH FLOWS RELATED TO FOREIGN DENOMINATED TRANSACTIONS. 3M IS ALSO EXPOSED TO THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY EARNINGS TO THE U.S. DOLLAR. THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE AGAINST THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. 3M MAY DEDESIGNATE THESE CASH FLOW HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS IN ADVANCE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION.

BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2014

,

3M BEGAN EXTENDING THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH IT HEDGES ITS EXPOSURE TO THE VARIABILITY IN FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS FROM A PREVIOUS TERM OF

12

MONTHS TO A LONGER TERM OF

24

MONTHS

, WITH CERTAIN CURRENCIES BEING EXTENDED FURTHER TO 36 MONTHS STARTING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015.

IN ADDITION, 3M ENTERS INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED IN HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS TO OFFSET, IN PART, THE IMPACTS OF CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY ACTIVITIES (PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERCOMPANY LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS AND INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS). AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, THE COMPANY ALSO USES FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE PORTIONS OF THE COMPANY’S NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. THE DOLLAR EQUIVALENT GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY’S FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AND THOSE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS WERE $2.8

BILLION AND $5.4

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, THE COMPANY HAD

974

MILLION EUROS

AND 248 BILLION SOUTH KOREAN WON

IN NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES ALONG WITH

3.6

BILLIO

N EUROS IN PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF

FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT DESIGNATED AS NON-DERIVATIVE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS IN CERTAIN NET INVESTMENT HEDGES AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1

2

IN THE “NET INVESTMENT HEDGES” SECTION.

INTEREST RATES RISK.

THE COMPANY MAY BE IMPACTED BY INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY WITH RESPECT TO EXISTING DEBT AND FUTURE DEBT ISSUANCES. 3M MANAGES INTEREST EXPENSE USING A MIX OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATE DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE BORROWING COSTS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AND QUALIFY AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY AGREES TO EXCHANGE, AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND FLOATING INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AN AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. THE DOLLAR EQUIVALENT (BASED ON INCEPTION DATE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES) GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANY’S INTEREST RATE SWAPS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

WAS $1.8

BILLION. ADDITIONAL DETAILS ABOUT 3M’S LONG-TERM DEBT CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE

10

, INCLUDING REFERENCES TO INFORMATION REGARDING DERIVATIVES AND/OR HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY’S LONG-TERM DEBT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMODITY PRICES RISK.

THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS. 3M

USED

COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FORECASTED COMMODITY TRANSACTIONS

TO MANAGE PRICE VOLATILITY, BUT DISCONTINUED THIS PRACTICE

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015. THE RELATED MARK-TO-MARKET GAIN OR LOSS ON QUALIFYING HEDGES WAS INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, AND RECLASSIFIED INTO COST OF SALES IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTED EARNINGS.

VALUE AT RISK.

THE VALUE AT RISK ANALYSIS IS PERFORMED ANNUALLY

TO ASSESS THE COMPANY’S

SENSITIVITY

TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY RATES, INTEREST RATES, AND COMMODITY PRICES.

A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO TEST THE

IMPACT ON

AFTER-TAX EARNINGS RELATED TO F

INANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (PRIMARILY DEBT), DERIVATIVES AND UNDERLYING EXPOSURES OUTSTANDING AT

DECEMBER 31, 2015

. THE MODEL (THIRD-PARTY BANK DATASET) USED A 95 PERCENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL OVER A 12-MONTH TIME HORIZON. THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY RATES MODEL USED 18 CURRENCIES, INTEREST RATES RELATED TO THREE CURRENCIES, AND COMMODITY PRICES RELATED TO FIVE COMMODITIES. THIS MODEL DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT WHAT ACTUALLY WILL BE EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY. THIS MODEL DOES NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN HEDGE TRANSACTIONS, BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THEIR INCLUSION WOULD NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESULTS.

THE RISK OF LOSS OR BENEFIT ASSOCIATED WITH EXCHANGE RATES WAS HIGHER IN 2015 DUE TO A GREATER MIX OF FLOATING RATE DEBT AND A RISING INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT IN THE U.S.

INTEREST RATE VOLATILITY INCREASED IN 2015, BASED ON A HIGHER MIX OF FLOATING RATE DEBT AND THE USE OF FORWARD RATES.

THE

FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE POSSIBLE ADVERSE AND POSITIVE IMPACTS TO AFTER-TAX EARNINGS RELATED TO THESE EXPOSURES.

IN ADDITION TO THE POSSIBLE ADVERSE AND POSITIVE IMPACTS DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE RELATED TO FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, RECENT HISTORICAL INFORMATION IS AS FOLLOWS. 3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR CURRENCY EFFECTS, INCLUDING HEDGING IMPACTS, HAD THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS ON

PRE-TAX

INCOME.

2015

($390

MILLION DECREASE)

AND

2014 ($100

MILLION DECREASE). THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF TRANSLATING PROFITS FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS; THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF GOODS BETWEEN 3M OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD; AND TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISKS AND THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SWAPPING VENEZUELAN BOLIVARS INTO U.S. DOLLARS. 3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES HAD THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS ON

PRE-TAX

INCOME.

2015

($180

MILLION INCREASE) AND

2014

($10

MILLION

IN

CREASE).

AN ANALYSIS OF THE GLOBAL EXPOSURES RELATED TO PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS IS PERFORMED AT EACH YEAR-END. A ONE PERCENT PRICE CHANGE WOULD RESULT IN A PRE-TAX COST OR SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $70

MILLION PER YEAR. THE GLOBAL ENERGY EXPOSURE IS SUCH THAT A TEN PERCENT PRICE CHANGE WOULD RESULT IN A PRE-TAX COST OR SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $40

MILLION PER YEAR. GLOBAL ENERGY EXPOSURE INCLUDES ENERGY COSTS USED IN 3M PRODUCTION AND OTHER FACILITIES, PRIMARILY ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS.

MANAGEMENT’S REPORT

ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN

INTERNAL CONTROL — INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013

).

MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 EXCLUDED CAPITAL SAFETY GROUP S.A.R.L. AND POLYPORE INTERNATIONAL, INC.’S SEPARATION MEDIA BUSINESS, WHICH WERE BOTH ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY IN AUGUST 2015 IN PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.

THESE ACQUIRED BUSINESS

ES

’ TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL NET SALES, IN THE AGGREGATE, REPRESENTED LESS THAN 2 PERCENT AND LESS THAN 1 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AMOUNTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015.

COMPANIES ARE ALLOWED TO EXCLUDE ACQUISITIONS FROM THEIR ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF ACQUISITION WHILE INTEGRATING THE ACQUIRED COMPANY UNDER GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT,

MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE.

THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN, WHICH EXPRESSES AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORT

OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 3M COMPANY

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF 3M COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES

(THE “COMPANY”) AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

(2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).  THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE COMPANY'S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS.  WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).  THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS.  OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION.  OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK.  OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS FOR MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES IN 2015.

A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  A COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANY’S ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.  ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

AS DESCRIBED IN MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, MANAGEMENT HAS EXCLUDED CAPITAL SAFETY GROUP S.A.R.L. (“CAPITAL SAFETY”) AND POLYPORE INTERNATIONAL, INC.’S SEPARATIONS MEDIA BUSINESS (“POLYPORE SEPARATIONS MEDIA”) FROM ITS ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 BECAUSE

THESE BUSINESSES WERE

ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY IN PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION

S

DURING 2015.  WE HAVE ALSO EXCLUDED CAPITAL SAFETY AND POLYPORE SEPARATIONS MEDIA FROM OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.  CAPITAL SAFETY IS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY AND THE COMPANY ACQUIRED THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF POLYPORE SEPARATIONS MEDIA WHOSE TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL NET SALES, IN THE AGGREGATE, REPRESENT LESS THAN

2

PERCENT AND LESS THAN

1

PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AMOUNTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION.

3M IS A DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL MANUFACTURER, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATOR AND MARKETER OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS. ALL SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. ALL INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERM “3M” OR “COMPANY” REFERS TO 3M COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE.

BASIS OF PRESENTATION.

CERTAIN BALANCES RELATIVE TO PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO DECEMBER 31, 2015 PRESENTATION IN CONNECTION WITH THE FOLLOWING, EACH OF WHICH IS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN THE INDICATED SECTION OF NOTE 1.

·

, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015 ON A RETROSPECTIVE BASIS AS FURTHER DISCUSSED IN THE NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS SECTION.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

LOCAL CURRENCIES GENERALLY ARE CONSIDERED THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR OPERATIONS IN LOCAL-CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS ARE TRANSLATED AT MONTH-END EXCHANGE RATES OF THE PERIOD REPORTED. INCOME AND EXPENSE ITEMS ARE TRANSLATED AT MONTH-END EXCHANGE RATES OF EACH APPLICABLE MONTH. CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY.

ALTHOUGH LOCAL CURRENCIES ARE TYPICALLY CONSIDERED AS THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) 830,

FOREIGN CURRENCY MATTERS

, THE REPORTING CURRENCY OF A FOREIGN ENTITY’S PARENT IS ASSUMED TO BE THAT ENTITY’S FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY WHEN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OF A FOREIGN ENTITY IS HIGHLY INFLATIONARY—GENERALLY WHEN ITS CUMULATIVE INFLATION IS APPROXIMATELY 100 PERCENT OR MORE FOR THE THREE YEARS THAT PRECEDE THE BEGINNING OF A REPORTING PERIOD. 3M HAS A SUBSIDIARY IN VENEZUELA WITH OPERATING INCOME REPRESENTING LESS THAN 1.0 PERCENT OF 3M’S CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME FOR 2015. SINCE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARY HAVE BEEN REMEASURED AS IF ITS FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY WERE THAT OF ITS PARENT.

THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT SETS OFFICIAL RATES OF EXCHANGE AND CONDITIONS PRECEDENT TO PURCHASE FOREIGN CURRENCY AT THESE RATES WITH LOCAL CURRENCY. SUCH RATES AND CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN AND CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO CHANGE. IN JANUARY 2014, THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED THAT THE NATIONAL CENTER FOR FOREIGN COMMERCE (CENCOEX), HAD ASSUMED THE ROLE WITH RESPECT TO THE CONTINUATION OF THE EXISTING OFFICIAL EXCHANGE RATE, SIGNIFICANTLY EXPANDED THE USE OF A SECOND CURRENCY AUCTION EXCHANGE MECHANISM CALLED THE COMPLEMENTARY SYSTEM FOR FOREIGN CURRENCY ACQUIREMENT (OR SICAD1), AND ISSUED EXCHANGE REGULATIONS INDICATING THE SICAD1 RATE OF EXCHANGE WOULD BE USED FOR PAYMENTS RELATED TO INTERNATIONAL INVESTMENTS. IN LATE MARCH 2014, THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT LAUNCHED A THIRD FOREIGN EXCHANGE MECHANISM, SICAD2, WHICH IT LATER REPLACED WITH ANOTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE PLATFORM IN FEBRUARY 2015 CALLED THE MARGINAL SYSTEM OF FOREIGN CURRENCY (SIMADI). THE SIMADI RATE WAS DESCRIBED AS BEING DERIVED FROM DAILY PRIVATE BIDDERS AND BUYERS EXCHANGING OFFERS THROUGH AUTHORIZED AGENTS

. THIS RATE IS

APPROVED AND PUBLISHED BY THE VENEZUELAN CENTRAL BANK.

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF 3M’S VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARY WERE REMEASURED UTILIZING THE OFFICIAL CENCOEX (OR ITS PREDECESSOR) RATE INTO MARCH 2014, THE SICAD1 RATE BEGINNING IN LATE MARCH 2014, THE SICAD2 RATE BEGINNING IN JUNE 2014, AND THE SIMADI RATE BEGINNING IN FEBRUARY 2015. 3M’S USES OF THESE RATES WERE BASED UPON EVALUATION OF A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE EXCHANGE RATE THE COMPANY’S VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARY MAY LEGALLY USE TO CONVERT CURRENCY, SETTLE TRANSACTIONS OR PAY DIVIDENDS; THE PROBABILITY OF ACCESSING AND OBTAINING CURRENCY BY USE OF A PARTICULAR RATE OR MECHANISM; AND THE COMPANY’S INTENT AND ABILITY TO USE A PARTICULAR EXCHANGE MECHANISM. OTHER FACTORS NOTWITHSTANDING, REMEASUREMENT IMPACTS OF THE CHANGES IN USE OF THESE EXCHANGE RATES DID NOT HAVE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON 3M’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MONITOR CIRCUMSTANCES RELATIVE TO ITS VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARY. CHANGES IN APPLICABLE EXCHANGE RATES OR EXCHANGE MECHANISMS MAY CONTINUE IN THE FUTURE. THESE CHANGES COULD IMPACT THE RATE OF EXCHANGE APPLICABLE TO REMEASURE THE COMPANY’S NET MONETARY ASSETS (LIABILITIES) DENOMINATED IN VENEZUELAN BOLIVARS (VEF). AS OF

55

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD A BALANCE OF NET MONETARY

LIABILITIES

DENOMINATED IN VEF OF LESS THAN 500 MILLION VEF AND THE CENCOEX, SICAD (FORMERLY SICAD1), AND SIMADI EXCHANGE RATES WERE APPROXIMATELY 6 VEF, 13 VEF, AND 200 VEF PER U.S. DOLLAR, RESPECTIVELY.

A NEED TO DECONSOLIDATE THE COMPANY’S VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARY’S OPERATIONS MAY RESULT FROM A LACK OF EXCHANGEABILITY OF VEF-DENOMINATED CASH COUPLED WITH AN ACUTE DEGRADATION IN THE ABILITY TO MAKE KEY OPERATIONAL DECISIONS DUE TO GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS IN VENEZUELA. 3M MONITORS FACTORS SUCH AS ITS ABILITY TO ACCESS VARIOUS EXCHANGE MECHANISMS; THE IMPACT OF GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS ON THE COMPANY’S ABILITY TO MANAGE ITS VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARY’S CAPITAL STRUCTURE, PURCHASING, PRODUCT PRICING, AND LABOR RELATIONS; AND THE CURRENT POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SITUATION WITHIN VENEZUELA. BASED UPON SUCH FACTORS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO CONSOLIDATE ITS VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE BALANCE OF INTERCOMPANY RECEIVABLES DUE FROM THIS SUBSIDIARY AND ITS EQUITY BALANCE ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT.

RECLASSIFICATIONS.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN THE PRIOR YEARS’ CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

USE OF ESTIMATES.

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH AND TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS WHEN ACQUIRED.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES.

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE METHOD OF CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN SECURITIES PREVIOUSLY CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT TO CURRENT. THIS NEW METHOD CLASSIFIES THESE SECURITIES AS CURRENT OR NON-CURRENT BASED ON THE NATURE OF THE SECURITIES AND AVAILABILITY FOR USE IN CURRENT OPERATIONS WHILE THE PRIOR CLASSIFICATION WAS BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S INTENDED HOLDING PERIOD, THE SECURITY’S MATURITY DATE AND LIQUIDITY CONSIDERATIONS BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS METHOD IS PREFERABLE BECAUSE IT IS CONSISTENT WITH HOW THE COMPANY MANAGES ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND LIQUIDITY. THE PRIOR PERIOD BALANCE HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

, INVESTMENTS-DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

, WHEN DETERMINING THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE IMPAIRMENT AS “TEMPORARY” OR “OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY”. A TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RESULTS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS BEING RECORDED IN THE OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY. SUCH AN UNREALIZED LOSS DOES NOT REDUCE NET INCOME FOR THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING PERIOD BECAUSE THE LOSS IS NOT VIEWED AS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. THE FACTORS EVALUATED TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN TEMPORARY AND OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY INCLUDE THE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, CREDIT RATINGS ACTIONS, AND ASSESSMENT OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS.

INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE EQUITY METHOD, COST METHOD, AND AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE EQUITY INVESTMENTS. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY.

OTHER ASSETS.

OTHER ASSETS INCLUDE DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, PRODUCT AND OTHER INSURANCE RECEIVABLES, THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES, AND OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. INVESTMENTS IN LIFE INSURANCE ARE REPORTED AT THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE REALIZED UNDER CONTRACT AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE, WITH ANY CHANGES IN CASH SURRENDER VALUE OR CONTRACT VALUE DURING THE PERIOD ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ADJUSTMENT OF PREMIUMS PAID. CASH OUTFLOWS AND INFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH LIFE

DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT GENERALLY IS COMPUTED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD BASED ON THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS PRIMARILY RANGE FROM TEN TO FORTY YEARS, WITH THE MAJORITY IN THE RANGE OF TWENTY TO FORTY YEARS. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT PRIMARILY RANGE FROM THREE TO FIFTEEN YEARS, WITH THE MAJORITY IN THE RANGE OF FIVE TO TEN YEARS. FULLY DEPRECIATED ASSETS ARE RETAINED IN PROPERTY AND ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTS UNTIL DISPOSAL. UPON DISPOSAL, ASSETS AND RELATED ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNTS AND THE NET AMOUNT, LESS PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSAL, IS CHARGED OR CREDITED TO OPERATIONS. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AMOUNTS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET (ASSET GROUP) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS RECORDED IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSET’S CARRYING VALUE OVER ITS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.

CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

A LIABILITY IS INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT IS INCURRED IF A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE CAN BE MADE. CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS EXIST FOR CERTAIN LONG-TERM ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. THE OBLIGATION IS INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE USING EXPECTED PRESENT VALUE TECHNIQUES. OVER TIME THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR PRESENT VALUE AND THE INITIAL CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF THE RELATED ASSETS. THE ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION LIABILITY WAS $102 MILLION AND $96 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, RESPECTIVELY.

GOODWILL.

GOODWILL IS THE EXCESS OF COST OF AN ACQUIRED ENTITY OVER THE AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR, AND IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY BE IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR GOODWILL IS DONE AT A REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, WITH ALL GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO A REPORTING UNIT. REPORTING UNITS ARE ONE LEVEL BELOW THE BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL, BUT CAN BE COMBINED WHEN REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE SAME SEGMENT HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. 3M DID NOT COMBINE ANY OF ITS REPORTING UNITS FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS GENERALLY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT’S NET ASSETS EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED USING EARNINGS FOR THE REPORTING UNIT MULTIPLIED BY A PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO FOR COMPARABLE INDUSTRY GROUPS, OR BY USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. COMPANIES HAVE THE OPTION TO FIRST ASSESS QUALITATIVE FACTORS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS NOT “MORE LIKELY THAN NOT” LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, WHICH IS COMMONLY REFERRED TO AS “STEP 0”. 3M HAS CHOSEN NOT TO APPLY STEP 0 FOR 2015 OR PRIOR

PERIOD ANNUAL GOODWILL ASSESSMENTS.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

INTANGIBLE ASSET TYPES INCLUDE CUSTOMER RELATED, PATENTS, OTHER TECHNOLOGY-BASED, TRADENAMES AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM AN INDEPENDENT PARTY. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE ARE AMORTIZED OVER A PERIOD RANGING FROM ONE TO TWENTY YEARS ON A SYSTEMATIC AND RATIONAL BASIS (GENERALLY STRAIGHT LINE) THAT IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE ASSET’S USE. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES VARY BY CATEGORY, WITH CUSTOMER RELATED LARGELY BETWEEN SEVEN TO SEVENTEEN YEARS, PATENTS LARGELY BETWEEN FIVE TO THIRTEEN YEARS, OTHER TECHNOLOGY-BASED LARGELY BETWEEN TWO TO FIFTE

EN

YEARS, DEFINITE LIVED TRADENAMES LARGELY BETWEEN THR

EE

AND TWENTY YEARS, AND OTHER INTANGIBLES LARGELY BETWEEN TWO TO TEN YEARS. COSTS RELATED TO INTERNALLY DEVELOPED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS PATENTS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED, PRIMARILY IN “RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.”

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET (ASSET GROUP) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USED IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. THE

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS RECORDED IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSET’S CARRYING VALUE OVER ITS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE, NAMELY CERTAIN TRADENAMES, ARE NOT AMORTIZED. INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, AND ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY BE IMPAIRED. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS GENERALLY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET.

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS.

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS GENERALLY INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS INVOLVING EMPLOYEE-RELATED SEVERANCE CHARGES, CONTRACT TERMINATION COSTS, AND IMPAIRMENT OR ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION/AMORTIZATION OF ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH ACTIONS.

EMPLOYEE-RELATED SEVERANCE CHARGES ARE LARGELY BASED UPON DISTRIBUTED EMPLOYMENT POLICIES AND SUBSTANTIVE SEVERANCE PLANS. THESE CHARGES ARE REFLECTED IN THE QUARTER WHEN THE ACTIONS ARE PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNTS ARE ESTIMABLE, WHICH TYPICALLY IS WHEN MANAGEMENT APPROVES THE ASSOCIATED ACTIONS. SEVERANCE AMOUNTS FOR WHICH AFFECTED EMPLOYEES WERE REQUIRED TO RENDER SERVICE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE BENEFITS AT THEIR TERMINATION DATES WERE MEASURED AT THE DATE SUCH BENEFITS WERE COMMUNICATED TO THE APPLICABLE EMPLOYEES AND RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE EMPLOYEES’ REMAINING SERVICE PERIODS. CONTRACT TERMINATION AND OTHER CHARGES PRIMARILY REFLECT COSTS TO TERMINATE A CONTRACT BEFORE THE END OF ITS TERM (MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME THE COMPANY PROVIDED NOTICE TO THE COUNTERPARTY) OR COSTS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE INCURRED UNDER THE CONTRACT FOR ITS REMAINING TERM WITHOUT ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO THE COMPANY. ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT REFLECT THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS’ CARRYING VALUES OVER THEIR FAIR VALUES.

REVENUE (SALES) RECOGNITION.

THE COMPANY SELLS A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSIFIED BASE OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD AND HAS NO MATERIAL CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE SUBSTANTIVELY TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS. THIS CONDITION NORMALLY IS MET WHEN THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN DELIVERED OR UPON PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES. THE COMPANY RECORDS ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE OR RECORDS EXPENSE FOR CUSTOMER AND DISTRIBUTOR INCENTIVES, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF REBATES AND FREE GOODS, AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THESE SALES INCENTIVES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 605,

REVENUE RECOGNITION

. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS OF REVENUE FOR REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TREND ANALYSIS AND PROJECTED MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS SERVED. SINCE THE COMPANY SERVES NUMEROUS MARKETS, THE REBATE PROGRAMS OFFERED VARY ACROSS BUSINESSES, BUT THE MOST COMMON INCENTIVE RELATES TO AMOUNTS PAID OR CREDITED TO CUSTOMERS FOR ACHIEVING DEFINED VOLUME LEVELS OR GROWTH OBJECTIVES. FREE GOODS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN EXPENSE AND RECORDED IN COST OF SALES. SALES, USE, VALUE-ADDED AND OTHER EXCISE TAXES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN REVENUE.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF 3M’S SALES AGREEMENTS ARE FOR STANDARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OCCURRING UPON DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCT OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE. HOWEVER, TO A LIMITED EXTENT 3M ALSO ENTERS INTO AGREEMENTS THAT INVOLVE MULTIPLE ELEMENTS (SUCH AS EQUIPMENT, INSTALLATION AND SERVICE), SOFTWARE, OR NON-STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

FOR NON-SOFTWARE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR DELIVERED ELEMENTS WHEN THEY HAVE STAND-ALONE VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER, THEY HAVE BEEN ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER, AND FOR WHICH THERE ARE ONLY CUSTOMARY REFUND OR RETURN RIGHTS. ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION IS ALLOCATED TO THE DELIVERABLES BY USE OF THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD. THE SELLING PRICE USED FOR EACH DELIVERABLE IS BASED ON VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE) IF AVAILABLE, THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE (TPE) IF VSOE IS NOT AVAILABLE, OR ESTIMATED SELLING PRICE IF NEITHER VSOE NOR TPE IS AVAILABLE. ESTIMATED SELLING PRICE IS DETERMINED IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH THAT USED TO ESTABLISH THE PRICE TO SELL THE DELIVERABLE ON A STANDALONE BASIS. IN ADDITION TO THE PRECEDING CONDITIONS, EQUIPMENT REVENUE IS NOT RECORDED UNTIL THE INSTALLATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED IF EQUIPMENT ACCEPTANCE IS DEPENDENT UPON INSTALLATION OR IF INSTALLATION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE EQUIPMENT. INSTALLATION REVENUES ARE NOT RECORDED UNTIL INSTALLATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED.

FOR ARRANGEMENTS (OR PORTIONS OF ARRANGEMENTS) FALLING WITHIN SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION STANDARDS AND THAT DO NOT INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION, MODIFICATION, OR CUSTOMIZATION, REVENUE FOR EACH SOFTWARE OR SOFTWARE-RELATED ELEMENT IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE COMPANY HAS VSOE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL OF THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS AND APPLICABLE CRITERIA HAVE BEEN MET FOR THE DELIVERED ELEMENTS. WHEN THE ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION, MODIFICATION OR CUSTOMIZATION, LONG-TERM CONSTRUCTION-TYPE ACCOUNTING INVOLVING PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE IS GENERALLY EMPLOYED.

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR PREPAID SERVICE CONTRACTS, SALES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT, UNLESS HISTORICAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THE COSTS ARE INCURRED ON OTHER THAN A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. LICENSE FEE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EARNED, AND NO REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED UNTIL THE INCEPTION OF THE LICENSE TERM.

ON OCCASION, AGREEMENTS WILL CONTAIN MILESTONES, OR 3M WILL RECOGNIZE REVENUE BASED ON PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE. FOR THESE AGREEMENTS, AND DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFICS, 3M MAY RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON COMPLETION OF A SUBSTANTIVE MILESTONE, OR IN PROPORTION TO COSTS INCURRED TO DATE COMPARED WITH THE ESTIMATE OF TOTAL COSTS TO BE INCURRED.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCES.

TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE RECORDED AT THE INVOICED AMOUNT AND DO NOT BEAR INTEREST. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ALLOWANCES FOR BAD DEBTS, CASH DISCOUNTS, PRODUCT RETURNS AND VARIOUS OTHER ITEMS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND PRODUCT RETURNS IS BASED ON THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES IN EXISTING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ANTICIPATED SALES RETURNS. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ALLOWANCES BASED ON HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE BY INDUSTRY AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC DATA AND HISTORICAL SALES RETURNS. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS MONTHLY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE-SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

ADVERTISING AND MERCHANDISING.

THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD INCURRED, AND TOTALED $368 MILLION IN 2015, $407 MILLION IN 2014 AND $423 MILLION IN 2013.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS IN THE PERIOD INCURRED AND ARE SHOWN ON A SEPARATE LINE OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES TOTALED $1.763 BILLION IN 2015, $1.770 BILLION IN 2014 AND $1.715 BILLION IN 2013. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, COVERING BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND IMPROVED PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, TOTALED $1.

223

BILLION IN 2015, $1.193 BILLION IN 2014 AND $1.150 BILLION IN 2013. RELATED EXPENSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT; INTERNALLY DEVELOPED PATENT COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE COSTS AND FEES INCURRED TO PREPARE, FILE, SECURE AND MAINTAIN PATENTS; AMORTIZATION OF EXTERNALLY ACQUIRED PATENTS AND EXTERNALLY ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT; AND GAINS/LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN CORPORATE APPROVED INVESTMENTS IN R&D-RELATED VENTURES, SUCH AS EQUITY METHOD EFFECTS AND IMPAIRMENTS.

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE.

THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES DIRECT COSTS OF SERVICES USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE. AMOUNTS CAPITALIZED ARE AMORTIZED OVER A PERIOD OF THREE TO SEVEN YEARS, GENERALLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, UNLESS ANOTHER SYSTEMATIC AND RATIONAL BASIS IS MORE REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SOFTWARE’S USE. AMOUNTS ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF EITHER MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT OR CAPITAL LEASES WITHIN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

ENVIRONMENTAL.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXISTING CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE REVENUES ARE EXPENSED. RESERVES FOR LIABILITIES RELATED TO ANTICIPATED REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES, THE COMPANY’S COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION, OR APPROVAL BY REGULATORY AGENCIES. ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE OPERATIONS GENERALLY ARE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.

INCOME TAXES.

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY APPROACH. UNDER THIS APPROACH, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES REPRESENT THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THEIR REALIZABILITY EXISTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014, THE COMPANY HAD VALUATION ALLOWANCES OF $31

MILLION AND $22 MILLION ON ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCREASE IN VALUATION ALLOWANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 RELATES TO CURRENT ACQUISITIONS IN CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES AND MEASURES ITS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS BASED ON THE RULES UNDER ASC 740,

INCOME TAXES.

EARNINGS PER SHARE.

THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE 3M SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR CALCULATING BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M COMMON SHAREHOLDERS IS THE RESULT OF THE DILUTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY’S STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. CERTAIN OPTIONS OUTSTANDING UNDER THESE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS DURING THE YEARS 2015, 2014 AND 2013 WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A DILUTIVE EFFECT (5.0 MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR 2015, 1.4

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR ITS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, WHICH INCLUDE STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE SHARES, AND THE GENERAL EMPLOYEES’ STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (GESPP). UNDER APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, THE FAIR VALUE OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS DETERMINED AT THE GRANT DATE AND THE RECOGNITION OF THE RELATED EXPENSE IS RECORDED OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION VESTS. REFER TO NOTE 15 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND THE COMPONENTS OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IS COMPOSED OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EFFECTS (INCLUDING HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES), DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLAN ADJUSTMENTS, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ASC 815,

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

, ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY AND COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY MARKET VOLATILITY. ALL HEDGING INSTRUMENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. IF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION CEASES TO EXIST, ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. INSTRUMENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH CHANGES RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. CASH FLOWS FROM DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED IN THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS IN THE SAME CATEGORY AS THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE ITEMS SUBJECT TO DESIGNATED HEDGE OR UNDESIGNATED (ECONOMIC) HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND IS NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES.

CREDIT RISK.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES IN INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS, COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS, AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY’S RISK IS LIMITED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH THE USE OF CREDIT APPROVALS AND CREDIT LIMITS, AND BY SELECTING MAJOR INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS COUNTERPARTIES. 3M ENTERS INTO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES WHEN POSSIBLE TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. A MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT MAY ALLOW EACH COUNTERPARTY TO NET SETTLE AMOUNTS OWED BETWEEN A 3M ENTITY AND THE COUNTERPARTY AS A RESULT OF MULTIPLE, SEPARATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES. 3M HAS ELECTED TO PRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND

60

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIABILITIES WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ON A GROSS BASIS EVEN WHEN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS AND MAY OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR NET PRESENTATION.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

3M FOLLOWS ASC 820,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES

, WITH RESPECT TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND NONRECURRING BASIS. UNDER THE STANDARD, FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE EXIT PRICE, OR THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE STANDARD ALSO ESTABLISHES A HIERARCHY FOR INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE THAT MAXIMIZES THE USE OF OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND MINIMIZES THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS BY REQUIRING THAT THE MOST OBSERVABLE INPUTS BE USED WHEN AVAILABLE. OBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE INPUTS MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN VALUING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY DEVELOPED BASED ON MARKET DATA OBTAINED FROM SOURCES INDEPENDENT OF THE COMPANY. UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE INPUTS THAT REFLECT THE COMPANY’S ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE FACTORS MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN VALUING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY DEVELOPED BASED UPON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE HIERARCHY IS BROKEN DOWN INTO THREE LEVELS. LEVEL 1 INPUTS ARE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. LEVEL 2 INPUTS INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, AND INPUTS (OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES) THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED UPON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

ACQUISITIONS.

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 805,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.

THIS STANDARD REQUIRES THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION TO RECOGNIZE ALL (AND ONLY) THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN THE TRANSACTION AND ESTABLISHES THE ACQUISITION-DATE FAIR VALUE AS THE MEASUREMENT OBJECTIVE FOR ALL ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THIS STANDARD PRESCRIBE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE DETERMINATION OF ACQUISITION-DATE FAIR VALUE OF CONSIDERATION PAID IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION (INCLUDING CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION) AND THE EXCLUSION OF TRANSACTION AND ACQUISITION-RELATED RESTRUCTURING COSTS FROM ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN APRIL 2014, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED ASU NO. 2014-08,

REPORTING DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND DISCLOSURES OF DISPOSALS OF COMPONENTS OF AN ENTITY

, WHICH CHANGED THE CRITERIA FOR DETERMINING WHICH DISPOSALS CAN BE PRESENTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND MODIFIED RELATED DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. THIS STANDARD HAS THE IMPACT OF REDUCING THE FREQUENCY OF DISPOSALS REPORTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS, BY REQUIRING SUCH A DISPOSAL TO REPRESENT A STRATEGIC SHIFT THAT HAS OR WILL HAVE A MAJOR EFFECT ON AN ENTITY’S OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS. HOWEVER, EXISTING PROVISIONS THAT PROHIBITED AN ENTITY FROM REPORTING A DISCONTINUED OPERATION IF IT HAD CERTAIN CONTINUING CASH FLOWS OR INVOLVEMENT WITH THE COMPONENT AFTER DISPOSAL WERE ELIMINATED BY THIS STANDARD. THE ASU ALSO EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES FOR DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS AND REQUIRES NEW DISCLOSURES RELATED TO INDIVIDUALLY SIGNIFICANT DISPOSALS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. FOR 3M, THIS ASU WAS EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2015. THIS ASU WAS APPLIED TO THE 2015 DIVESTITURE INFORMATION DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 AND HAD NO MATERIAL IMPACT ON CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN MAY 2014, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2014-09,

REVENUE FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS

, AND IN AUGUST 2015 ISSUED ASU NO. 2015-14, WHICH AMENDED ASU NO. 2014-09 AS TO EFFECTIVE DATE. THE ASU, AS AMENDED, PROVIDES A SINGLE COMPREHENSIVE MODEL TO BE USED IN THE ACCOUNTING FOR REVENUE ARISING FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS AND SUPERSEDES MOST CURRENT REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY-SPECIFIC GUIDANCE. THE STANDARD’S STATED CORE PRINCIPLE IS THAT AN ENTITY SHOULD RECOGNIZE REVENUE TO DEPICT THE TRANSFER OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY EXPECTS TO BE ENTITLED IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. TO ACHIEVE THIS CORE PRINCIPLE THE ASU INCLUDES PROVISIONS WITHIN A FIVE STEP MODEL THAT INCLUDES IDENTIFYING THE CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER, IDENTIFYING THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS IN THE CONTRACT, DETERMINING THE TRANSACTION PRICE, ALLOCATING THE TRANSACTION PRICE TO THE PERFORMANCE OBLIGATIONS, AND RECOGNIZING REVENUE WHEN (OR AS) AN ENTITY SATISFIES A PERFORMANCE OBLIGATION. THE STANDARD ALSO SPECIFIES THE ACCOUNTING FOR SOME COSTS TO OBTAIN OR FULFILL A CONTRACT WITH A CUSTOMER AND REQUIRES EXPANDED DISCLOSURES ABOUT REVENUE RECOGNITION. THE STANDARD PROVIDES FOR EITHER FULL RETROSPECTIVE ADOPTION OR A MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE ADOPTION BY WHICH IT IS APPLIED ONLY TO THE MOST CURRENT PERIOD PRESENTED. FOR 3M, THE ASU, AS

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AMENDED, IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2018. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THIS STANDARD’S IMPACT ON 3M’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN FEBRUARY 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2015-02,

AMENDMENTS TO THE CONSOLIDATION ANALYSIS

, WHICH CHANGES GUIDANCE RELATED TO BOTH THE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY (VIE) AND VOTING INTEREST ENTITY (VOE) CONSOLIDATION MODELS. WITH RESPECT TO THE VIE MODEL, THE STANDARD CHANGES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE IDENTIFICATION OF VARIABLE INTERESTS ASSOCIATED WITH FEES PAID TO A DECISION MAKER OR SERVICE PROVIDER, THE VIE CHARACTERISTICS FOR A LIMITED PARTNER OR SIMILAR ENTITY, AND THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY DETERMINATION. WITH RESPECT TO THE VOE MODEL, THE ASU ELIMINATES THE PRESUMPTION THAT A GENERAL PARTNER CONTROLS A LIMITED PARTNERSHIP OR SIMILAR ENTITY UNLESS THE PRESUMPTION CAN OTHERWISE BE OVERCOME. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, A GENERAL PARTNER WOULD LARGELY NOT CONSOLIDATE A PARTNERSHIP OR SIMILAR ENTITY UNDER THE VOE MODEL. FOR 3M, THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. 3M DOES NOT HAVE SIGNIFICANT INVOLVEMENT WITH ENTITIES SUBJECT TO CONSOLIDATION CONSIDERATIONS IMPACTED BY THE VIE MODEL CHANGES OR WITH LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS POTENTIALLY IMPACTED BY THE VOE MODEL CHANGES. AS A RESULT, 3M DOES NOT EXPECT THIS ASU TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN APRIL 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2015-03,

SIMPLIFYING THE PRESENTATION OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS

, AND IN AUGUST 2015 ISSUED ASU NO. 2015-15,

PRESENTATION AND SUBSEQUENT MEASUREMENT OF DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LINE-OF-CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS

. UNDER ASU 2015-03, DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS REPORTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET WOULD BE REFLECTED AS A DIRECT DEDUCTION FROM THE RELATED DEBT LIABILITY RATHER THAN AS AN ASSET. WHILE ASU 2015-03 ADDRESSES COSTS RELATED TO TERM DEBT, ASU NO. 2015-15 PROVIDES CLARIFICATION REGARDING COSTS TO SECURE REVOLVING LINES OF CREDIT, WHICH ARE, AT THE OUTSET, NOT ASSOCIATED WITH AN OUTSTANDING BORROWING. ASU NO. 2015-15 PROVIDES COMMENTARY THAT THE SEC STAFF WOULD NOT OBJECT TO AN ENTITY DEFERRING AND PRESENTING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH LINE-OF-CREDIT ARRANGEMENTS AS AN ASSET AND SUBSEQUENTLY AMORTIZING THEM RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE REVOLVING DEBT ARRANGEMENT. FOR 3M, ASU NO. 2015-03 IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS ASU IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015 WITH RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO PRIOR PERIODS. AS A RESULT, DEBT ISSUE COSTS AGGREGATING $26 MILLION PREVIOUSLY INCLUDED WITHIN OTHER ASSETS HAVE BEEN REFLECTED AS REDUCTIONS IN THE BALANCES OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014.

IN APRIL 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2015-05,

CUSTOMER’S ACCOUNTING FOR FEES PAID IN A CLOUD ARRANGEMENT

, WHICH REQUIRES A CUSTOMER TO DETERMINE WHETHER A CLOUD COMPUTING ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS A SOFTWARE LICENSE. IF THE ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS A SOFTWARE LICENSE, THE CUSTOMER WOULD ACCOUNT FOR FEES RELATED TO THE SOFTWARE LICENSE ELEMENT IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH ACCOUNTING FOR THE ACQUISITION OF OTHER ACQUIRED SOFTWARE LICENSES. IF THE ARRANGEMENT DOES NOT CONTAIN A SOFTWARE LICENSE, THE CUSTOMER WOULD ACCOUNT FOR THE ARRANGEMENT AS A SERVICE CONTRACT. AN ARRANGEMENT WOULD CONTAIN A SOFTWARE LICENSE ELEMENT IF BOTH (1) THE CUSTOMER HAS THE CONTRACTUAL RIGHT TO TAKE POSSESSION OF THE SOFTWARE AT ANY TIME DURING THE HOSTING PERIOD WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT PENALTY AND (2) IT IS FEASIBLE FOR THE CUSTOMER TO EITHER RUN THE SOFTWARE ON ITS OWN HARDWARE OR CONTRACT WITH ANOTHER PARTY UNRELATED TO THE VENDOR TO HOST THE SOFTWARE. FOR 3M, THIS ASU IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. THE STANDARD PROVIDES FOR ADOPTION EITHER FULLY RETROSPECTIVELY OR PROSPECTIVELY TO ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO, OR MATERIALLY MODIFIED, AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THIS ASU TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3M’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN MAY 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2015-07,

DISCLOSURES FOR INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN ENTITIES THAT CALCULATE NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE (OR ITS EQUIVALENT)

. THIS STANDARD MODIFIES EXISTING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS SUCH THAT INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT IS USED TO MEASURE THEIR FAIR VALUE AT NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) WOULD BE REMOVED FROM THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY DISCLOSURES. INSTEAD, AN ENTITY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO INCLUDE THOSE INVESTMENTS AS A RECONCILING ITEM SUCH THAT THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE AMOUNT OF INVESTMENTS IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY DISCLOSURE IS CONSISTENT WITH THE AMOUNT ON THE BALANCE SHEET. CHANGES WERE ALSO MADE TO THE REQUIREMENTS IN A SPONSOR’S EMPLOYEE BENEFIT PLAN ASSET DISCLOSURES. FOR 3M, THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS ASU IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015 WITH RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO PRIOR PERIODS. AS A RESULT, NOTE 11, PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, REFLECTS THE MODIFIED DISCLOSURES WITH RESPECT TO APPLICABLE PLAN ASSETS. AS THIS ASU ONLY RELATES TO CERTAIN DISCLOSURES, IT DID NOT IMPACT THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN JULY 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2015-11,

SIMPLIFYING THE MEASUREMENT OF INVENTORY

, WHICH MODIFIES EXISTING REQUIREMENTS REGARDING MEASURING INVENTORY AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. UNDER EXISTING STANDARDS, THE MARKET AMOUNT REQUIRES CONSIDERATION OF REPLACEMENT COST, NET REALIZABLE VALUE (NRV), AND NRV LESS AN APPROXIMATELY NORMAL PROFIT

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARGIN. THE NEW ASU REPLACES MARKET WITH NRV, DEFINED AS ESTIMATED SELLING PRICES IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, LESS REASONABLY PREDICTABLE COSTS OF COMPLETION, DISPOSAL AND TRANSPORTATION. THIS ELIMINATES THE NEED TO DETERMINE AND CONSIDER REPLACEMENT COST OR NRV LESS AN APPROXIMATELY NORMAL PROFIT MARGIN WHEN MEASURING INVENTORY. FOR 3M, THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2017, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THIS ASU’S IMPACTS ON 3M’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN SEPTEMBER 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2015-16,

SIMPLIFYING THE ACCOUNTING FOR MEASUREMENT-PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS

, THAT ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT FOR AN ACQUIRER IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION TO ACCOUNT FOR MEASUREMENT-PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS RETROSPECTIVELY. UNDER EXISTING STANDARDS, AN ACQUIRER IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION REPORTS PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS WITH RESPECT TO ACQUIRED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WHEN THEIR MEASUREMENTS ARE INCOMPLETE AS OF THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. PRIOR TO THE IMPACT OF THIS ASU, AN ACQUIRER IS REQUIRED TO ADJUST PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS (AND THE RELATED IMPACT ON EARNINGS) BY RESTATING PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DURING THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD WHICH CANNOT EXCEED ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF A MEASUREMENT-PERIOD ADJUSTMENT (INCLUDING THE IMPACT ON PRIOR PERIODS) BE RECOGNIZED IN THE REPORTING PERIOD IN WHICH THE ADJUSTMENT IS IDENTIFIED—ELIMINATING THE REQUIREMENT TO RESTATE PRIOR PERIOD FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE NEW STANDARD REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE NATURE AND AMOUNT OF MEASUREMENT-PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS AS WELL AS INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE PORTION OF THE ADJUSTMENTS RECORDED IN CURRENT-PERIOD EARNINGS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN PREVIOUS REPORTING PERIODS IF THE ADJUSTMENTS TO PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS HAD BEEN RECOGNIZED AS OF THE ACQUISITION DATE. THE ASU IS APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY TO MEASUREMENT-PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS THAT OCCUR AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE. FOR 3M, THIS STANDARD IS REQUIRED PROSPECTIVELY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2016, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. THE COMPANY ADOPTED THIS STANDARD WITH RESPECT TO MEASUREMENT-PERIOD ADJUSTMENTS BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015. ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE, AS APPLICABLE, IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 2, ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES.

IN NOVEMBER 2015, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2015-17,

BALANCE SHEET CLASSIFICATION OF DEFERRED TAXES

, WHICH REQUIRES ENTITIES TO PRESENT DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (DTAS) AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES (DTLS), ALONG WITH ANY RELATED VALUATION ALLOWANCE, AS NONCURRENT IN A BALANCE SHEET. THIS ASU ELIMINATES CURRENT GUIDANCE REQUIRING DEFERRED TAXES FOR EACH JURISDICTION TO BE PRESENTED AS A NET CURRENT ASSET OR LIABILITY AND A NET NONCURRENT ASSET OR LIABILITY. AS A RESULT, EACH JURISDICTION WOULD HAVE ONE NET NONCURRENT DTA OR DTL BALANCE. THE ASU DOES NOT CHANGE THE EXISTING REQUIREMENT THAT ONLY PERMITS OFFSETTING DTAS AND DTLS WITHIN A PARTICULAR JURISDICTION. FOR 3M, THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2017, WITH EARLY ADOPTION PERMITTED. IN LIGHT OF THE PROCESS SIMPLIFICATION PROVIDED BY THIS ASU, THE COMPANY ADOPTED

THIS STANDARD

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015 WITH RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO PRIOR PERIODS. AS A RESULT, THE DECEMBER 31, 2014 BALANCES OF DTAS AND DTLS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED WERE IMPACTED AS FOLLOWS.

IN JANUARY 2016, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2016-01,

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

, WHICH REVISES THE ACCOUNTING RELATED TO (1) THE CLASSIFICATION AND MEASUREMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND (2) THE PRESENTATION OF CERTAIN FAIR VALUE CHANGES FOR FINANCIAL LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE ASU ALSO AMENDS CERTAIN DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT OF INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SECURITIES AND OTHER OWNERSHIP INTERESTS IN AN ENTITY, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN PARTNERSHIPS, UNINCORPORATED JOINT VENTURES AND LIMITED LIABILITY COMPANIES (COLLECTIVELY, EQUITY SECURITIES) THAT DO NOT RESULT IN CONSOLIDATION AND ARE NOT ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD. ENTITIES WILL NEED TO MEASURE THESE INVESTMENTS AND RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE IN NET INCOME. ENTITIES WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO RECOGNIZE UNREALIZED HOLDING GAINS AND LOSSES ON EQUITY SECURITIES THEY CLASSIFY UNDER CURRENT GUIDANCE AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI). THEY ALSO WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO USE THE COST METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR EQUITY SECURITIES THAT DO NOT HAVE READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES. INSTEAD, FOR THESE TYPES OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS THAT DO NOT OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR THE NET ASSET VALUE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT, ENTITIES WILL BE PERMITTED TO ELECT A PRACTICABILITY EXCEPTION AND

63

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MEASURE THE INVESTMENT AT COST LESS IMPAIRMENT PLUS OR MINUS OBSERVABLE PRICE CHANGES (IN ORDERLY TRANSACTIONS). THE ASU ALSO ESTABLISHES AN INCREMENTAL RECOGNITION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENT RELATED TO THE PRESENTATION OF FAIR VALUE CHANGES OF FINANCIAL LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION (FVO) HAS BEEN ELECTED. UNDER THIS GUIDANCE, AN ENTITY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO SEPARATELY PRESENT IN OCI THE PORTION OF THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE CHANGE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK AS OPPOSED TO REFLECTING THE ENTIRE AMOUNT IN EARNINGS. FOR DERIVATIVE LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE FVO HAS BEEN ELECTED, HOWEVER, ANY CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INSTRUMENT-SPECIFIC CREDIT RISK WOULD CONTINUE TO BE PRESENTED IN NET INCOME, WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT GUIDANCE. FOR 3M, THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2018 VIA A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO BEGINNING RETAINED EARNINGS, EXCEPT FOR GUIDANCE RELATIVE TO EQUITY SECURITIES WITHOUT READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES WHICH IS APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THIS ASU’S IMPACTS ON 3M’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

NOTE 2.  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

ACQUISITIONS.

3M MAKES ACQUISITIONS OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES FROM TIME TO TIME THAT ARE ALIGNED WITH ITS STRATEGIC INTENT WITH RESPECT TO, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GROWTH MARKETS AND ADJACENT PRODUCT LINES OR TECHNOLOGIES.

THE IMPACT ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET OF THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS RELATED TO 2015 ACQUISITIONS AND ASSIGNED WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTANGIBLE ASSET LIVES, INCLUDING ADJUSTMENTS RELATIVE TO OTHER ACQUISITIONS WITHIN THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD, FOLLOWS.

THE ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE CONSIDERATION RELATED TO THE AUGUST 2015 CAPITAL SAFETY AND POLYPORE SEPARATIONS MEDIA ACQUISITIONS IS CONSIDERED PRELIMINARY, PRIMARILY WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN TAX-RELATED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. 3M EXPECTS TO FINALIZE THE ALLOCATION OF PURCHASE PRICE WITHIN THE ONE YEAR MEASUREMENT-PERIOD FOLLOWING THESE ACQUISITIONS. ADJUSTMENTS TO PRELIMINARY ALLOCATIONS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE IDENTIFICATION AND VALUATION OF CERTAIN INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS (FURTHER DISCUSSED BELOW). THE CHANGE TO PROVISIONAL AMOUNTS RESULTED IN AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2015, A PORTION OF WHICH RELATES TO EARLIER QUARTERS IN THE MEASUREMENT PERIOD.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD TAX EFFECTED OPERATING LOSSES, CAPITAL LOSSES, AND TAX CREDIT CARRYOVERS FOR FEDERAL (APPROXIMATELY

$31

MILLION), STATE (APPROXIMATELY

$2

MILLION), AND INTERNATIONAL (APPROXIMATELY

$76

MILLION), WITH ALL AMOUNTS BEFORE VALUATION ALLOWANCES. THE FEDERAL TAX ATTRIBUTE CARRYOVERS WILL EXPIRE AFTER

YEAR OR WITH AN INDEFINITE CARRYOVER PERIOD. THE TAX ATTRIBUTES BEING CARRIED OVER ARISE AS CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS MAY HAVE TAX LOSSES OR MAY HAVE INABILITIES TO UTILIZE CERTAIN LOSSES WITHOUT THE SAME TYPE OF TAXABLE INCOME. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED

$31

MILLION OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE AGAINST CERTAIN OF THESE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS BASED ON MANAGEMENT’S DETERMINATION THAT IT IS MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THAT THE TAX BENEFITS RELATED TO THESE ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED.

THE

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2015 WAS

29.1

PERCENT, COMPARED TO

28.9

PERCENT IN 2014, AN INCREASE OF

0.2

PERCENTAGE POINTS, IMPACTED BY SEVERAL FACTORS. FACTORS WHICH INCREASED THE COMPANY’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDED INTERNATIONAL TAXES, WHICH WERE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY RATES AND CHANGES TO THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES, AND OTHER ITEMS. COMBINED, THESE FACTORS INCREASED THE COMPANY’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY

2.4

PERCENTAGE POINTS. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

2.2

PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE, WHICH RELATED TO THE REMEASUREMENTS OF 3M’S UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, INCLUDING THE RESTORATION OF TAX BASIS ON CERTAIN ASSETS FOR WHICH DEPRECIATION DEDUCTIONS WERE PREVIOUSLY LIMITED, AND INCREASES IN THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURER’S DEDUCTION AND U.S. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT BENEFITS.

T

HE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2014 WAS

28.9

PERCENT, COMPARED TO

28.1

PERCENT IN 2013, AN INCREASE OF

0.8

PERCENTAGE POINTS, IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS. FACTORS WHICH INCREASED THE COMPANY’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE INCLUDED A ONE-TIME INTERNATIONAL TAX IMPACT RELATED TO THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE SUPPLY CHAIN CENTER OF EXPERTISE IN EUROPE, DECREASED U.S. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT IN 2014 COMPARED TO 2013 DUE TO

TWO

YEARS INCLUSION AS A RESULT OF THE REINSTATEMENT IN 2013, DECREASED DOMESTIC MANUFACTURER’S DEDUCTION, AND OTHER ITEMS. COMBINED, THESE FACTORS INCREASED THE COMPANY’S EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY

1.6

PERCENTAGE POINTS. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

0.8

PERCENTAGE POINT DECREASE, WHICH RELATED TO BOTH LOWER 3M INCOME TAX RESERVES FOR 2014 WHEN COMPARED TO 2013 AND INTERNATIONAL TAXES AS A RESULT OF CHANGES TO THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF INCOME BEFORE TAXES.

THE COMPANY FILES INCOME TAX RETURNS IN THE U.S. FEDERAL JURISDICTION, AND VARIOUS STATES AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO U.S. FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL, OR NON-U.S. INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS BY TAX AUTHORITIES FOR YEARS BEFORE 2005.

THE IRS HAS COMPLETED ITS FIELD EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANY’S U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2005 THROUGH 2013. THE COMPANY PROTESTED CERTAIN IRS POSITIONS WITHIN THESE TAX YEARS AND ENTERED INTO THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS PROCESS WITH THE IRS. IN DECEMBER 2012, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A STATUTORY NOTICE OF DEFICIENCY FOR THE 2006 YEAR. THE COMPANY FILED A PETITION IN TAX COURT IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2013 RELATING TO THE 2006 TAX YEAR. CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY IS UNDER EXAMINATION BY THE IRS FOR ITS U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2014 AND 2015. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE IRS WILL COMPLETE ITS EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANY FOR 2014 BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016 AND FOR 2015 BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2017. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE IRS HAS NOT PROPOSED ANY SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANY’S TAX POSITIONS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS NOT ADEQUATELY RESERVED.

PAYMENTS RELATING TO OTHER PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS ARISING FROM THE 2005 THROUGH 2015 EXAMINATIONS MAY NOT BE MADE UNTIL A FINAL AGREEMENT IS REACHED BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE IRS ON SUCH ASSESSMENTS OR UPON A FINAL RESOLUTION RESULTING FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS PROCESS OR JUDICIAL ACTION. IN ADDITION TO THE U.S. FEDERAL EXAMINATION, THERE IS ALSO AUDIT ACTIVITY IN SEVERAL U.S. STATE AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.

3M ANTICIPATES CHANGES TO THE COMPANY’S UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS DUE TO THE CLOSING AND RESOLUTION OF AUDIT ISSUES FOR VARIOUS AUDIT YEARS MENTIONED ABOVE AND CLOSURE OF STATUTES. THE COMPANY IS NOT CURRENTLY ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AS A RESULT OF THE ONGOING INCOME TAX AUTHORITY EXAMINATIONS.

THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UTB, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY

MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015,

$265

MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, AND

$262

MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2013. THE ENDING NET UTB RESULTS FROM ADJUSTING THE GROSS BALANCE FOR ITEMS SUCH AS FEDERAL, STATE, AND NON-U.S. DEFERRED ITEMS, INTEREST AND PENALTIES, AND DEDUCTIBLE TAXES. THE NET UTB IS INCLUDED AS COMPONENTS OF OTHER ASSETS, ACCRUED INCOME TAXES, AND OTHER LIABILITIES WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES INTEREST AND PENALTIES ACCRUED RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN TAX EXPENSE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME ON A GROSS BASIS APPROXIMATELY

$2

MILLION OF EXPENSE,

$14

MILLION OF BENEFIT, AND

$22

MILLION OF EXPENSE IN 2015, 2014, AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST AND PENALTIES RECOGNIZED MAY BE AN EXPENSE OR BENEFIT DUE TO NEW OR REMEASURED UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFIT ACCRUALS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, AND DECEMBER 31, 2014, ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ON A GROSS BASIS WERE

$45

MILLION AND

$44

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN THESE INTEREST AND PENALTY AMOUNTS ARE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO TAX POSITIONS FOR WHICH THE ULTIMATE DEDUCTIBILITY IS HIGHLY CERTAIN BUT FOR WHICH THERE IS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING OF SUCH DEDUCTIBILITY. BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF DEFERRED TAX ACCOUNTING, OTHER THAN INTEREST AND PENALTIES, THE DISALLOWANCE OF THE SHORTER DEDUCTIBILITY PERIOD WOULD NOT AFFECT THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BUT WOULD ACCELERATE THE PAYMENT OF CASH TO THE TAXING AUTHORITY TO AN EARLIER PERIOD.

AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT COMMITMENTS AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MADE BY 3M, INCOME FROM CERTAIN MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES IN THE FOLLOWING COUNTRIES IS SUBJECT TO REDUCED TAX RATES OR, IN SOME CASES, IS EXEMPT FROM TAX FOR YEARS THROUGH THE FOLLOWING: TAIWAN (2015), CHINA (2016), KOREA (2018), BRAZIL (2023), SWITZERLAND (2024), AND SINGAPORE (2025). THE INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TAX STATUS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE

$114

MILLION (

18

CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2015,

$99

MILLION (

15

CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2014, AND

$87

MILLION (

THE COMPANY HAS NOT PROVIDED DEFERRED TAXES ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE REINVESTED INDEFINITELY, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AN ACQUIRED ENTITY. THESE EARNINGS RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS AND WERE APPROXIMATELY

$1

2

BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015. BECAUSE OF THE AVAILABILITY OF U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, THE MULTIPLE AVENUES IN WHICH TO REPATRIATE THE EARNINGS TO MINIMIZE TAX COST, AND BECAUSE A LARGE PORTION OF THESE EARNINGS ARE NOT LIQUID, IT IS NOT PRACTICAL TO DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE NOT REINVESTED INDEFINITELY.

CLASSIFICATION OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2015

AND

2014, GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS AND/OR LOSSES (PRE-TAX) WERE

NOT

MATERIAL. REFER TO NOTE 6 FOR A TABLE THAT PROVIDES THE NET REALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) RELATED TO SALES OR IMPAIRMENTS OF DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, WHICH INCLUDES MARKETABLE SECURITIES. THE GROSS AMOUNTS OF THE REALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES WERE NOT MATERIAL. COST OF SECURITIES SOLD USE THE FIRST IN, FIRST OUT (FIFO) METHOD. SINCE THESE MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WILL FLOW THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WITH AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO EARNINGS UPON SALE OR “OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY” IMPAIRMENT.

3M REVIEWS IMPAIRMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS MARKETABLE SECURITIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE MEASUREMENT GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY ASC 320

, INVESTMENTS-DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

, WHEN DETERMINING THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE IMPAIRMENT AS “TEMPORARY” OR “OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY”. A TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RESULTS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS BEING RECORDED IN THE OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY. SUCH AN UNREALIZED LOSS DOES NOT REDUCE NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M FOR THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING PERIOD BECAUSE THE LOSS IS NOT VIEWED AS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. THE FACTORS EVALUATED TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN TEMPORARY AND OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY INCLUDE THE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, CREDIT RATINGS ACTIONS, AND ASSESSMENT OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, AS WELL AS OTHER FACTORS.

MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015. WITHIN THIS PORTFOLIO, CURRENT ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES (ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF

$57

MILLION) PRIMARILY INCLUDE INTERESTS IN AUTOMOBILE LOANS, CREDIT CARDS AND EQUIPMENT LEASES. 3M’S INVESTMENT POLICY ALLOWS INVESTMENTS IN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES WITH MINIMUM CREDIT RATINGS OF AA2 BY MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE OR AA BY STANDARD & POOR’S OR FITCH RATINGS OR DBRS. ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES MUST BE RATED BY AT LEAST

TWO

OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RATING AGENCIES,

ONE

OF WHICH MUST BE MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE OR STANDARD & POOR’S. AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, ALL ASSET-BACKED SECURITY INVESTMENTS WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THIS POLICY. APPROXIMATELY

75.8

PERCENT OF ALL ASSET-BACKED SECURITY INVESTMENTS WERE RATED AAA OR A-1+ BY STANDARD & POOR’S AND/OR AAA OR P-1 BY MOODY’S INVESTORS SERVICE AND/OR AAA OR F1+ BY FITCH RATINGS. INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL MAY IMPACT THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS IN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, WHILE FACTORS SUCH AS GENERAL CONDITIONS IN THE OVERALL CREDIT MARKET AND THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL MAY AFFECT THE LIQUIDITY OF INVESTMENTS IN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES. 3M DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT RISK RELATED TO ITS HOLDING IN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES TO MATERIALLY IMPACT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY.

NOTE 11.  PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

3M HAS COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. IN TOTAL, 3M HAS OVER

80

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS IN

28

COUNTRIES. PENSION BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANS GENERALLY ARE BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANT’S YEARS OF SERVICE, COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. THE PRIMARY U.S. DEFINED-BENEFIT PENSION PLAN WAS CLOSED TO NEW PARTICIPANTS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009. THE COMPANY ALSO PROVIDES CERTAIN POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS U.S. EMPLOYEES WHO REACH RETIREMENT AGE WHILE EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. MOST INTERNATIONAL EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES ARE COVERED BY GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. THE COST OF COMPANY-PROVIDED POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE PLANS FOR INTERNATIONAL EMPLOYEES IS NOT MATERIAL AND IS COMBINED WITH U.S. AMOUNTS IN THE TABLES THAT FOLLOW.

THE COMPANY ALSO SPONSORS EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS UNDER SECTION 401(K) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THESE PLANS ARE OFFERED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL REGULAR U.S. EMPLOYEES. FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2009, EMPLOYEE 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS OF UP TO

6%

OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION WERE MATCHED IN CASH AT RATES OF

60%

OR

75%

, DEPENDING ON THE PLAN IN WHICH THE EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATES. EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009, RECEIVED A CASH MATCH OF

100%

FOR EMPLOYEE 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS OF UP TO

6%

OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION AND ALSO RECEIVED AN EMPLOYER RETIREMENT INCOME ACCOUNT CASH CONTRIBUTION OF

3%

OF THE PARTICIPANT’S TOTAL ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION. BEGINNING ON JANUARY 1, 2016, FOR U.S. EMPLOYEES, THE COMPANY REDUCED ITS MATCH ON EMPLOYEE 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS. FOR ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2009, EMPLOYEE 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS OF UP TO

5%

OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION WILL BE MATCHED IN CASH AT RATES OF

45%

OR

60%

, DEPENDING ON THE PLAN IN WHICH THE EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATES. EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009, WILL RECEIVE A CASH MATCH OF 100% FOR EMPLOYEE 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS OF UP TO 5% OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION AND WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO RECEIVE AN EMPLOYER RETIREMENT INCOME ACCOUNT CASH CONTRIBUTION OF 3% OF THE PARTICIPANT’S TOTAL ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION. ALL CONTRIBUTIONS ARE INVESTED IN A NUMBER OF INVESTMENT FUNDS PURSUANT TO THE EMPLOYEES’ ELECTIONS. EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE U.S. DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS WERE

$165

MILLION,

$153

MILLION AND

$136

MILLION FOR 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY. 3M SUBSIDIARIES IN VARIOUS INTERNATIONAL COUNTRIES ALSO PARTICIPATE IN DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS. EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE INTERNATIONAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS WERE

$77

MILLION,

$75

MILLION AND

$71

MILLION FOR 2015, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE DEPOSITS FOR ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS WITH INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES. TRUST FUNDS AND DEPOSITS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE MAINTAINED TO PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR BENEFICIARIES. THERE ARE NO PLAN ASSETS IN THE NON-QUALIFIED PLAN DUE TO ITS NATURE. FOR ITS U.S. POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PLANS, THE COMPANY HAS SET ASIDE AMOUNTS AT LEAST EQUAL TO ANNUAL BENEFIT PAYMENTS WITH AN INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

3M’S PRIMARY U.S. QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN DOES NOT HAVE A MANDATORY CASH CONTRIBUTION BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS A SIGNIFICANT CREDIT BALANCE FROM PREVIOUS DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS THAT CAN BE APPLIED TO ANY PENSION PROTECTION ACT FUNDING REQUIREMENTS.

AS A RESULT OF CHANGES MADE TO ITS U.S. POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLANS IN 2010, THE COMPANY HAS TRANSITIONED ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE RETIREES TO A SAVINGS ACCOUNT BENEFITS-BASED PLAN. THESE CHANGES BECAME EFFECTIVE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2013, FOR ALL MEDICARE ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND THEIR MEDICARE ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS AND BECAME EFFECTIVE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2016, FOR ALL NON-MEDICARE ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND THEIR ELIGIBLE DEPENDENTS.

IN AUGUST 2015, 3M MODIFIED THE 3M RETIREE WELFARE BENEFIT PLAN POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL BENEFIT REDUCING THE FUTURE BENEFIT FOR PARTICIPANTS NOT RETIRED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2016.

FOR PARTICIPANTS RETIRING AFTER JANUARY 1, 2016, T

HE RETIREE MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNT (RMSA)

IS

NO LONGER CREDITED WITH INTEREST AND THE INDEXATION ON BOTH THE RMSA AND THE MEDICARE HEALTH REIMBURSEMENT ARRANGEMENT

IS

REDUCED FROM

3

PERCENT TO

1.5

PERCENT PER YEAR (FOR THOSE EMPLOYEES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THESE ACCOUNTS). ALSO EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2016, 3M NO LONGER OFFER

S

3M RETIREE HEALTH CARE ACCOUNTS TO NEW HIRES. DUE TO THESE CHANGES THE PLAN WAS RE-MEASURED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2015, RESULTING IN A DECREASE TO THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY

$233

MILLION, AND A RELATED INCREASE TO SHAREHOLDERS’ EQUITY, SPECIFICALLY ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2014, FORMER U.S. EMPLOYEES WHO HAVE A PENSION BENEFIT FOR WHICH THEY HAVE NOT BEGUN RECEIVING PAYMENT (TERM VESTED) WERE OFFERED A LUMP SUM PAYOUT OF THEIR PENSION BENEFIT. AS A RESULT OF THIS ACTION, THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION (PBO) LIABILITY WAS REDUCED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014 BY APPROXIMATELY

$270

MILLION, WITH THE ACTUAL CASH PAYOUT OF APPROXIMATELY THE SAME AMOUNT PAID FROM THE PLAN’S ASSETS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014. THE PBO LIABILITY REDUCTION WAS

34%

OF THE TERM VESTED ELIGIBLE PBO AND A

2%

REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL U.S. PENSION PBO LIABILITY BASED ON THE DECEMBER 31, 2013, VALUATION. THERE WAS

NO

PENSION EXPENSE IMPACT AS A RESULT OF THIS ACTION ON 3M’S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME IN 2014.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2014, 3M’S BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED AN AMENDMENT OF THE U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN TO INCLUDE A LUMP SUM PAYMENT OPTION FOR EMPLOYEES THAT HAVE VESTED RETIREMENT BENEFITS WHO COMMENCE THEIR PENSION JANUARY 1, 2015, OR LATER. THIS OPTION IS ALSO AVAILABLE TO VESTED EMPLOYEES WHO LEAVE 3M BEFORE BECOMING ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE AT THE TIME OF TERMINATION. THIS CHANGE REDUCED 3M’S YEAR-END 2014 U.S.

PENSION

PBO LIABILITY BY APPROXIMATELY

$266

MILLION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014, THE COMPANY CONVERTED TO THE “RP 2014 MORTALITY TABLES” AND UPDATED THE MORTALITY IMPROVEMENT SCALE IT USED FOR CALCULATING THE YEAR-END 2014 U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION ANNUITANT AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND 2015 EXPENSE. THE IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE INCREASED THE YEAR-END 2014 U.S. PENSION PBO BY APPROXIMATELY

$820

MILLION AND THE U.S. ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY APPROXIMATELY

$100

MILLION.

IN MARCH 2015, 3M JAPAN MODIFIED THE JAPAN LIMITED DEFINED BENEFIT CORPORATE PENSION PLAN (DBCPP). BEGINNING JULY 1, 2015, ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES RECEIVE A COMPANY PROVIDED CONTRIBUTION MATCH OF

6.12%

OF THEIR ELIGIBLE SALARY TO THEIR DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLAN. EMPLOYEES NO LONGER EARN ADDITIONAL SERVICE TOWARDS THEIR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS AFTER JULY 1, 2015, EXCEPT FOR ELIGIBLE SALARIES ABOVE THE STATUTORY DEFINED CONTRIBUTION LIMITS. AS A RESULT OF THIS PLAN MODIFICATION, THE COMPANY RE-MEASURED THE DBCPP, WHICH RESULTED IN A

$17

MILLION PRE-TAX CURTAILMENT GAIN FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2015.

I

N MARCH

2015, 3M

ALSO

RECEIVED A FAVORABLE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE TAX DETERMINATION LETTER

TO TERMINATE A FROZEN DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN OF ONE OF 3M’S ACQUIRED SUBSIDIARIES. BY THE END OF 2015, TH

IS

LAN

MADE FINAL

DISTRIBUT

IONS OF

$16

MILLION TO PARTICIPANTS.

THE COMPANY ALSO HAD OTHER SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS, SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER ITEMS IN 2015 AGGREGATING TO THE AMOUNTS INDICATED IN THESE COMPONENTS IN THE APPLICABLE TABLES THAT FOLLOW.

3M WAS INFORMED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, THAT THE GENERAL PARTNERS OF WG TRADING COMPANY, IN WHICH 3M’S BENEFIT PLANS HOLD LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS, ARE THE SUBJECT OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AS WELL AS CIVIL PROCEEDINGS BY THE SEC AND CFTC (COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION). IN MARCH 2011, OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF 3M AND

SIX

OTHER LIMITED PARTNERS OF WG TRADING COMPANY, THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE RULED IN FAVOR OF THE COURT APPOINTED RECEIVER’S PROPOSED DISTRIBUTION PLAN (AND IN APRIL 2013, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE DISTRICT COURT’S RULING).

THE BENEFIT PLAN TRUSTEE HOLDINGS OF WG TRADING COMPANY INTERESTS WERE ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE DECREASED ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE, INCLUSIVE OF ESTIMATED INSURANCE PROCEEDS, AS OF THE ANNUAL MEASUREMENT DATES.

82

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY HAS INSURANCE THAT IT BELIEVES, BASED ON WHAT IS CURRENTLY KNOWN, WILL RESULT IN THE PROBABLE RECOVERY OF A PORTION OF THE DECREASE IN ORIGINAL ASSET VALUE. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2014, 3M AND CERTAIN 3M BENEFIT PLANS FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA AGAINST

FIVE

INSURERS SEEKING INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR THE WG TRADING COMPANY CLAIM. IN SEPTEMBER 2015, THE COURT RULED IN FAVOR OF THE DEFENDANT INSURANCE COMPANIES ON A MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT AND DISMISSED THE LAWSUIT. IN OCTOBER 2015, 3M AND THE 3M BENEFIT PLANS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL TO THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE EIGHTH CIRCUIT.

AS OF THE 2015 MEASUREMENT DATE, THESE HOLDINGS REPRESENTED LESS THAN

ONE HALF OF ONE PERCENT

OF 3M’S FAIR VALUE OF TOTAL PLAN ASSETS. 3M CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THESE EVENTS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLES INCLUDE A RECONCILIATION OF THE BEGINNING AND ENDING BALANCES OF THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS AS WELL AS A SUMMARY OF THE RELATED AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 31 OF THE RESPECTIVE YEARS. 3M ALSO HAS CERTAIN NON-QUALIFIED UNFUNDED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, INCLUSIVE OF PLANS RELATED TO SUPPLEMENT/EXCESS BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES IMPACTED BY PARTICULAR RELOCATIONS AND OTHER MATTERS, THAT INDIVIDUALLY AND IN THE AGGREGATE ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT AND WHICH ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE TABLES THAT FOLLOW. THE OBLIGATIONS FOR THESE PLANS ARE INCLUDED WITHIN OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND AGGREGATED LESS THAN

$35

MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014.

THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF TRANSITIONING ALL CURRENT AND FUTURE RETIREES IN THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE BENEFIT PLANS TO A SAVINGS ACCOUNT BENEFITS-BASED PLAN. THE CONTRIBUTIONS PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY TO THE HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS INCREASE 3 PERCENT PER YEAR FOR EMPLOYEES WHO RETIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2016 AND INCREASE 1.5 PERCENT FOR EMPLOYEES WHO RETIRE ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2016. THEREFORE, THE COMPANY NO LONGER HAS MATERIAL EXPOSURE TO HEALTH CARE COST INFLATION.

THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, WHICH IS ALSO THE DATE USED FOR THE RELATED ANNUAL MEASUREMENT ASSUMPTIONS. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THE COMPANY SETS ITS RATE TO REFLECT THE YIELD OF A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY, FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD PRODUCE CASH FLOWS SUFFICIENT IN TIMING AND AMOUNT TO SETTLE PROJECTED FUTURE BENEFITS. USING THIS METHODOLOGY, THE COMPANY DETERMINED A DISCOUNT RATE OF

4.47%

FOR PENSION AND

4.48%

FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS TO BE APPROPRIATE FOR ITS U.S. PLANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF

0.37

PERCENTAGE POINTS AND

0.41

PERCENTAGE POINTS, RESPECTIVELY, FROM THE RATES USED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2014. FOR THE INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS THE DISCOUNT RATES ALSO REFLECT THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IF THE COUNTRY HAS A DEEP MARKET IN CORPORATE BONDS THE COMPANY MATCHES THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM THE PLAN EITHER TO A PORTFOLIO OF BONDS THAT GENERATE SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW OR A NOTIONAL YIELD CURVE GENERATED FROM AVAILABLE BOND INFORMATION. IN COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT HAVE A DEEP MARKET IN CORPORATE BONDS, GOVERNMENT BONDS ARE CONSIDERED WITH A RISK PREMIUM TO APPROXIMATE CORPORATE BOND YIELDS.

BEGINNING IN 2016, 3M CHANGED THE METHOD USED TO ESTIMATE THE SERVICE AND INTEREST COST COMPONENTS OF THE NET PERIODIC PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS. THE NEW METHOD MEASURES SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS SEPARATELY USING THE SPOT YIELD CURVE APPROACH APPLIED TO EACH CORRESPONDING OBLIGATION. SERVICE COSTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON DURATION-SPECIFIC SPOT RATES APPLIED TO THE SERVICE COST CASH FLOWS. THE INTEREST COST CALCULATION IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING DURATION-SPECIFIC SPOT RATES TO THE YEAR-BY-YEAR PROJECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS. THE SPOT YIELD CURVE APPROACH DOES NOT AFFECT THE MEASUREMENT OF THE TOTAL BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS THE CHANGE IN SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS OFFSET IN THE ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE COMPANY CHANGED TO THE NEW METHOD TO PROVIDE A MORE PRECISE MEASURE OF SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS BY IMPROVING THE CORRELATION BETWEEN THE PROJECTED BENEFIT CASH FLOWS AND THE DISCRETE SPOT YIELD CURVE RATES. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTED FOR THIS CHANGE AS A CHANGE IN ESTIMATE PROSPECTIVELY BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2016.

FOR THE PRIMARY U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANY’S ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS

7.75%

IN 2015. PROJECTED RETURNS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON BROAD, PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY AND FIXED-INCOME INDICES AND FORWARD-LOOKING ESTIMATES OF ACTIVE PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY’S 2016 EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS IS

7.50%

, A DECREASE OF

0.25

PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 2015. THE EXPECTED RETURN ASSUMPTION IS BASED ON THE STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION OF THE PLAN, LONG TERM CAPITAL MARKET RETURN EXPECTATIONS AND EXPECTED PERFORMANCE FROM ACTIVE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. THE 2015 EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN

. IN 2014 THE PLAN EARNED A RATE OF RETURN OF

13.0%

AND IN 2013 EARNED A RETURN OF

6.0%

. THE AVERAGE ANNUAL ACTUAL RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS OVER THE PAST 10 AND 25 YEARS HAS BEEN

7.8%

AND

10.0%

, RESPECTIVELY. RETURN ON ASSETS ASSUMPTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE CALCULATED ON A PLAN-BY-PLAN BASIS USING PLAN ASSET ALLOCATIONS AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTIONS.

DURING 2015, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED

$3

MILLION TO ITS POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. DURING 2014, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED

$210

MILLION TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS AND

MILLION TO ITS POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. IN 2016, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE AN AMOUNT IN THE RANGE OF

$100

MILLION TO

$200

MILLION OF CASH TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL RETIREMENT PLANS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED MINIMUM CASH PENSION CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2016. FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS, INTEREST RATES AND OTHER FACTORS.

PLAN ASSET MANAGEMENT

3M’S INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IS TO MANAGE THE FUNDS ON A GOING-CONCERN BASIS. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE TRUST FUNDS IS TO MEET THE OBLIGATIONS AS REQUIRED. THE SECONDARY GOAL IS TO EARN THE HIGHEST RATE OF RETURN POSSIBLE, WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING ITS PRIMARY GOAL, AND WITHOUT SUBJECTING THE COMPANY TO AN UNDUE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTION RISK. FUND RETURNS ARE USED TO HELP FINANCE PRESENT AND FUTURE OBLIGATIONS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE WITHIN ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED FUNDING LIMITS AND TAX-DETERMINED ASSET LIMITS, THUS REDUCING THE POTENTIAL NEED FOR ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM 3M. THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY HAS USED LONG DURATION CASH BONDS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO OFFSET A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY OF U.S. PENSION LIABILITIES.

NORMALLY, 3M DOES NOT BUY OR SELL ANY OF ITS OWN SECURITIES AS A DIRECT INVESTMENT FOR ITS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT FUNDS. HOWEVER, DUE TO EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT OF THE FUNDS, THE PLANS MAY INDIRECTLY BUY, SELL OR HOLD 3M SECURITIES. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF 3M SECURITIES ARE NOT CONSIDERED TO BE MATERIAL RELATIVE TO THE AGGREGATE FUND PERCENTAGES.

THE DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS REFERENCES THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF CERTAIN ASSETS IN TERMS OF LEVELS 1, 2 AND 3. SEE NOTE 13 FOR DESCRIPTIONS OF THESE LEVELS. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE VALUATION METHODS ARE APPROPRIATE AND CONSISTENT WITH OTHER MARKET PARTICIPANTS, THE USE OF DIFFERENT METHODOLOGIES OR ASSUMPTIONS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS COULD RESULT IN A DIFFERENT ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE AT THE REPORTING DATE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

U.S. PENSION PLANS AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS

IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES IN THE U.S. PENSION PLANS AND U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, THE INVESTMENT POLICIES INCLUDE A TARGET STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION. THE INVESTMENT POLICIES ALLOW SOME TOLERANCE AROUND THE TARGET IN RECOGNITION THAT MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND ILLIQUIDITY OF SOME INVESTMENTS MAY CAUSE THE ALLOCATION TO A SPECIFIC ASSET CLASS TO VARY FROM THE TARGET ALLOCATION, POTENTIALLY FOR LONG PERIODS OF TIME. ACCEPTABLE RANGES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO ALLOW FOR DEVIATION FROM STRATEGIC TARGETS AND TO ALLOW FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TACTICAL OVER- AND UNDER-WEIGHTS. THE PORTFOLIOS WILL NORMALLY BE REBALANCED WHEN THE QUARTER-END ASSET ALLOCATION DEVIATES FROM ACCEPTABLE RANGES. THE ALLOCATION IS REVIEWED REGULARLY BY THE NAMED FIDUCIARY OF THE PLANS.  APPROXIMATELY

39%

OF THE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS ARE IN A 401(H) ACCOUNT. THE 401(H) ACCOUNT ASSETS ARE IN THE SAME TRUST AS THE PRIMARY U.S. PENSION PLAN AND INVESTED WITH THE SAME INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES AS THE PRIMARY U.S. PENSION PLAN.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS HELD BY THE U.S. PENSION PLANS BY ASSET CLASS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS ASSETS

OUTSIDE THE U.S., PENSION PLAN ASSETS ARE TYPICALLY MANAGED BY DECENTRALIZED FIDUCIARY COMMITTEES. THE DISCLOSURE BELOW OF ASSET CATEGORIES IS PRESENTED IN AGGREGATE FOR OVER

70

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS IN

COUNTRIES; HOWEVER, THERE IS SIGNIFICANT VARIATION IN ASSET ALLOCATION POLICY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY. LOCAL REGULATIONS, LOCAL FUNDING RULES, AND LOCAL FINANCIAL AND TAX CONSIDERATIONS ARE PART OF THE FUNDING AND INVESTMENT ALLOCATION PROCESS IN EACH COUNTRY. THE COMPANY PROVIDES STANDARD FUNDING AND INVESTMENT GUIDANCE TO ALL INTERNATIONAL PLANS WITH MORE FOCUSED GUIDANCE TO THE LARGER PLANS.

EACH PLAN HAS ITS OWN STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION. THE ASSET ALLOCATIONS ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY AND REBALANCED WHEN NECESSARY.

PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE REPRESENTING EITHER HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS OR HEDGE COMPONENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

CASH FLOW HEDGING - FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE AGAINST THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. THE SETTLEMENT OR EXTENSION OF THESE DERIVATIVES WILL RESULT IN RECLASSIFICATIONS (FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME) TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS. 3M MAY DEDESIGNATE THESE CASH FLOW HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS IN ADVANCE OF THE OCCURRENCE OF THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION. THE PORTION OF GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT PREVIOUSLY ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR DEDESIGNATED HEDGES REMAINS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION OCCURS. CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AFTER DEDESIGNATION ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS SECTION BELOW.

CASH FLOW HEDGING - COMMODITY PRICE MANAGEMENT.

THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD CONTRACTS. 3M DISCONTINUED THE USE OF COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FORECASTED COMMODITY TRANSACTIONS IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2015. THE COMPANY USED COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FORECASTED COMMODITY TRANSACTIONS TO MANAGE PRICE VOLATILITY. THE RELATED MARK-TO-MARKET GAIN OR LOSS ON QUALIFYING HEDGES WAS INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, AND RECLASSIFIED INTO COST OF SALES IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTED EARNINGS.

CASH FLOW HEDGING — INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AND QUALIFY AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVES AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING LOSS OR GAIN ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

FAIR VALUE HEDGING - INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES INTEREST EXPENSE USING A MIX OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATE DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE BORROWING COSTS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY AGREES TO EXCHANGE, AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND FLOATING INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AN AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. THE MARK-TO-MARKET OF THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES IS RECORDED AS GAINS OR LOSSES IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND IS OFFSET BY THE GAIN OR LOSS OF THE UNDERLYING DEBT INSTRUMENT, WHICH ALSO IS RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND, THUS, THERE IS NO IMPACT ON EARNINGS DUE TO HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS.

IN JULY 2007, IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF A

SEVEN

-YEAR EUROBOND FOR AN AMOUNT OF

750

MILLION EUROS, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A FIXED-TO-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAP ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF

400

MILLION EUROS AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE OF A PORTION OF THE FIXED INTEREST RATE EUROBOND OBLIGATION. IN AUGUST 2010, THE COMPANY TERMINATED

150

MILLION EUROS OF THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THIS SWAP. AS A RESULT, A GAIN OF

18

MILLION EUROS, RECORDED AS PART OF THE BALANCE OF THE UNDERLYING DEBT, WAS AMORTIZED AS AN OFFSET TO INTEREST EXPENSE OVER THIS DEBT’S REMAINING LIFE. PRIOR TO TERMINATION OF THE APPLICABLE PORTION OF THE INTEREST RATE SWAP, THE MARK-TO-MARKET OF THE HEDGE INSTRUMENT WAS RECORDED AS GAINS OR LOSSES IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND WAS OFFSET BY THE GAIN OR LOSS ON CARRYING VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING DEBT INSTRUMENT. CONSEQUENTLY, THE SUBSEQUENT AMORTIZATION OF THE 18 MILLION EUROS RECORDED AS PART OF THE UNDERLYING DEBT BALANCE WAS NOT PART OF GAINS ON HEDGED ITEMS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME IN THE TABLES BELOW. THE REMAINING INTEREST RATE SWAP OF

250

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES.

THE COMPANY MAY USE NON-DERIVATIVE (FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT) AND DERIVATIVE (FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS) INSTRUMENTS TO HEDGE PORTIONS OF THE COMPANY’S INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND MANAGE FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK. FOR INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AND QUALIFY AS HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS AND THAT MEET THE EFFECTIVENESS REQUIREMENTS, THE NET GAINS OR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN SPOT EXCHANGE RATES ARE RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE REMAINDER OF THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS IS RECORDED IN EARNINGS. RECOGNITION IN EARNINGS OF AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION IS LIMITED TO CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS COMPLETE OR SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE LIQUIDATION OF THE NET INVESTMENT IN THE HEDGED FOREIGN OPERATION. TO THE EXTENT FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT IS NOT DESIGNATED IN OR IS DEDESIGNATED FROM A NET INVESTMENT HEDGE RELATIONSHIP, CHANGES IN VALUE OF THAT PORTION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT DUE TO EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS THROUGH THEIR MATURITY DATE.

3M’S USE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED IN HEDGES OF THE COMPANY’S NET INVESTMENT IN FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES CAN VARY BY TIME PERIOD DEPENDING ON WHEN FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT BALANCES DESIGNATED IN SUCH RELATIONSHIPS ARE DEDESIGNATED, MATURED, OR ARE NEWLY ISSUED AND DESIGNATED. ADDITIONALLY, VARIATION CAN OCCUR IN CONNECTION WITH THE EXTENT OF THE COMPANY’S DESIRED FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISK COVERAGE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGES WAS APPROXIMATELY

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE DEDESIGNATED FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS THAT FORMERLY WERE DESIGNATED IN CASH FLOW HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS (AS REFERENCED IN THE CASH FLOW HEDGES SECTION ABOVE). IN ADDITION, 3M ENTERS INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO OFFSET, IN PART, THE IMPACTS OF CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY ACTIVITIES (PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH INTERCOMPANY LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS) AND ENTERS INTO COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS TO OFFSET, IN PART, FLUCTUATIONS IN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE USE OF CERTAIN COMMODITIES AND PRECIOUS METALS. THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE NOT DESIGNATED IN HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS; THEREFORE, FAIR VALUE GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES.

CREDIT RISK AND OFFSETTING OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES IN INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS, COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS, AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY’S RISK IS LIMITED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH THE USE OF CREDIT APPROVALS AND CREDIT LIMITS, AND BY SELECTING MAJOR INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS COUNTERPARTIES. 3M ENTERS INTO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH COUNTERPARTIES WHEN POSSIBLE TO MITIGATE CREDIT RISK IN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. A MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT MAY ALLOW EACH COUNTERPARTY TO NET SETTLE AMOUNTS OWED BETWEEN A 3M ENTITY AND THE COUNTERPARTY AS A RESULT OF MULTIPLE, SEPARATE DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, 3M HAS INTERNATIONAL SWAPS AND DERIVATIVES ASSOCIATION (ISDA) AGREEMENTS WITH

1

6

APPLICABLE BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS WHICH CONTAIN NETTING PROVISIONS. IN ADDITION TO A MASTER AGREEMENT WITH 3M SUPPORTED BY A

PRIMARY

COUNTERPARTY’S PARENT GUARANTEE, 3M ALSO HAS ASSOCIATED CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS IN PLACE WITH

1

5

OF ITS PRIMARY DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES WHICH, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PROVIDE THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH EITHER PARTY IS REQUIRED TO POST ELIGIBLE COLLATERAL (WHEN THE MARKET VALUE OF TRANSACTIONS COVERED BY THESE AGREEMENTS EXCEEDS SPECIFIED THRESHOLDS OR IF A COUNTERPARTY’S CREDIT RATING HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO A PREDETERMINED RATING). THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES.

3M HAS ELECTED TO PRESENT THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITHIN THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ON A GROSS BASIS EVEN WHEN DERIVATIVE TRANSACTIONS ARE SUBJECT TO MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENTS AND MAY OTHERWISE QUALIFY FOR NET PRESENTATION. HOWEVER, THE FOLLOWING TABLES PROVIDE INFORMATION AS IF THE COMPANY HAD ELECTED TO OFFSET THE ASSET AND LIABILITY BALANCES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, NETTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH VARIOUS CRITERIA IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT OR TERMINATION AS STIPULATED BY THE TERMS OF NETTING ARRANGEMENTS WITH EACH OF THE COUNTERPARTIES. FOR EACH COUNTERPARTY, IF NETTED, THE COMPANY WOULD OFFSET THE ASSET AND LIABILITY BALANCES OF ALL DERIVATIVES AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD BASED ON THE 3M ENTITY THAT IS A PARTY TO THE TRANSACTIONS. DERIVATIVES NOT SUBJECT TO MASTER NETTING AGREEMENTS ARE NOT ELIGIBLE FOR NET PRESENTATION. AS OF THE APPLICABLE DATES PRESENTED BELOW, NO CASH COLLATERAL HAD BEEN RECEIVED OR PLEDGED RELATED TO THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

NOTE 13.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

3M FOLLOWS ASC 820,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES

, WITH RESPECT TO ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND NONRECURRING BASIS. UNDER THE STANDARD, FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE EXIT PRICE, OR THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE STANDARD ALSO ESTABLISHES A HIERARCHY FOR INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE THAT MAXIMIZES THE USE OF OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND MINIMIZES THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS BY REQUIRING THAT THE MOST OBSERVABLE INPUTS BE USED WHEN AVAILABLE. OBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE INPUTS MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN VALUING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY DEVELOPED BASED ON MARKET DATA OBTAINED FROM SOURCES INDEPENDENT OF THE COMPANY. UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE INPUTS THAT REFLECT THE COMPANY’S ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE FACTORS MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN VALUING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY DEVELOPED BASED UPON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. THE HIERARCHY IS BROKEN DOWN INTO THREE LEVELS. LEVEL 1 INPUTS ARE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. LEVEL 2 INPUTS INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR LIABILITIES IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, AND INPUTS (OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES) THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED UPON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS

.

FOR 3M, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS PRIMARILY RELATE TO AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS (INCLUDED AS PART OF INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET) AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. DERIVATIVES INCLUDE CASH FLOW HEDGES, INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND MOST NET INVESTMENT HEDGES. THE INFORMATION IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS AND TABLES PRIMARILY ADDRESSES MATTERS RELATIVE TO THESE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS FOR 2015 AND 2014.

3M USES VARIOUS VALUATION TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE MARKET AND INCOME APPROACHES, WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED FOR THE RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES — EXCEPT CERTAIN U.S. MUNICIPAL SECURITIES.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES, EXCEPT CERTAIN U.S. MUNICIPAL SECURITIES, ARE VALUED UTILIZING MULTIPLE SOURCES. A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE IS USED FOR THESE SECURITIES. MARKET PRICES ARE OBTAINED FOR THESE SECURITIES FROM A VARIETY OF INDUSTRY STANDARD DATA PROVIDERS, SECURITY MASTER FILES FROM LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY SOURCES. THESE MULTIPLE PRICES ARE USED AS INPUTS INTO A DISTRIBUTION-CURVE-BASED ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE THE DAILY FAIR VALUE TO BE USED. 3M CLASSIFIES U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES AS LEVEL 1, WHILE ALL OTHER MARKETABLE SECURITIES (EXCLUDING CERTAIN U.S. MUNICIPAL SECURITIES) ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2. MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 9.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES —CERTAIN U.S. MUNICIPAL SECURITIES ONLY.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER 2014, 3M OBTAINED A MUNICIPAL BOND WITH THE CITY OF NEVADA, MISSOURI, WHICH REPRESENT 3M’S ONLY U.S. MUNICIPAL SECURITIES HOLDING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015. DUE TO THE NATURE OF THIS SECURITY, THE VALUATION METHOD UTILIZED WILL INCLUDE THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF THE CITY OF NEVADA, ANY RECENT MUNICIPAL BOND ISSUANCES BY NEVADA, AND MACROECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS RELATED TO THE DIRECTION OF INTEREST RATES AND THE HEALTH OF THE OVERALL MUNICIPAL BOND MARKET, AND AS SUCH WILL BE CLASSIFIED AS A LEVEL 3 SECURITY.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE EQUITY SECURITIES THAT ARE TRADED IN AN ACTIVE MARKET. CLOSING STOCK PRICES ARE READILY AVAILABLE FROM ACTIVE MARKETS AND ARE USED AS BEING REPRESENTATIVE OF FAIR VALUE. 3M CLASSIFIES THESE SECURITIES AS LEVEL 1.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE COMPANY’S DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ASC 815,

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

, ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY’S DERIVATIVES THAT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS, COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, AND NET INVESTMENT HEDGES WHERE THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. NET INVESTMENT HEDGES THAT USE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT TO HEDGE 3M’S NET INVESTMENT ARE NOT IMPACTED BY THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT STANDARD UNDER ASC 820, AS THE DEBT USED AS THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS MARKED TO A VALUE WITH RESPECT TO CHANGES IN SPOT FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND NOT WITH RESPECT TO OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT FAIR VALUE.

3M HAS DETERMINED THAT FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARDS, COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS, FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS WILL BE CONSIDERED LEVEL 2 MEASUREMENTS. 3M USES INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET. THESE INPUTS INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, VOLATILITIES, AND INTEREST RATES. DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE PRIMARILY VALUED USING STANDARD CALCULATIONS/MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS READILY OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS. INDUSTRY STANDARD DATA PROVIDERS ARE 3M’S PRIMARY SOURCE FOR FORWARD AND SPOT RATE INFORMATION FOR BOTH INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY RATES, WITH RESULTING VALUATIONS PERIODICALLY VALIDATED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY OR COUNTERPARTY QUOTES AND A NET PRESENT VALUE STREAM OF CASH FLOWS MODEL.

IN ADDITION, THE PLAN ASSETS OF 3M’S PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY). REFER TO NOTE 11.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS.

DISCLOSURES ARE REQUIRED FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, BUT ARE RECOGNIZED AND DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS IN PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO INITIAL RECOGNITION. FOR 3M, SUCH MEASUREMENTS OF FAIR VALUE RELATE PRIMARILY TO LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS. THERE WERE NO MATERIAL LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS FOR 2015, 2014 AND 2013.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

THE COMPANY’S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, BORROWINGS, AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT (EXCEPT THE

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS, IN ADDITION TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUES AS INDICATED IN THE PRECEDING DISCLOSURES. FOR ITS LONG-TERM DEBT, THE COMPANY UTILIZED THIRD-PARTY QUOTES TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUES (CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2). INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF THESE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOLLOW.

THE FAIR VALUES REFLECTED ABOVE CONSIDER THE TERMS OF THE RELATED DEBT ABSENT THE IMPACTS OF DERIVATIVE/HEDGING ACTIVITY. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF LONG-TERM DEBT REFERENCED ABOVE IS IMPACTED BY CERTAIN FIXED-TO-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAPS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES AND BY THE DESIGNATION OF FIXED RATE EUROBOND SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS OF THE COMPANY’S NET INVESTMENT IN ITS EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES. MANY OF 3M’S FIXED-RATE BONDS WERE TRADING AT A PREMIUM AT DECEMBER 31, 2015 AND 2014 DUE TO THE LOW INTEREST RATES AND TIGHTENING OF 3M’S CREDIT SPREADS.

RENTAL EXPENSE UNDER OPERATING LEASES WAS

$330

MILLION IN 2013. IT IS 3M’S PRACTICE TO SECURE RENEWAL RIGHTS FOR LEASES, THEREBY GIVING 3M THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO MAINTAIN A PRESENCE IN A LEASED FACILITY. 3M HAS

THREE

PRIMARY CAPITAL LEASES. FIRST, 3M HAS A CAPITAL LEASE, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN APRIL 2003, THAT INVOLVES A BUILDING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (WITH A LEASE TERM OF

22

YEARS). DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, 3M RECORDED A CAPITAL LEASE ASSET AND OBLIGATION OF APPROXIMATELY

33.5

MILLION BRITISH POUND (GBP), OR APPROXIMATELY

$50

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, EXCHANGE RATES. SECOND, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, 3M RECORDED A CAPITAL LEASE ASSET AND OBLIGATION OF APPROXIMATELY

UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS.

UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS ARE DEFINED AS AN AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES THAT IS ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING (NON-CANCELABLE, OR CANCELABLE ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES). THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS TOTAL UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATION COMMITMENT (FOR THOSE CONTRACTS WITH TERMS IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, AT

$596

MILLION. PAYMENTS BY YEAR ARE ESTIMATED AS FOLLOWS: 2016 (

$193

MILLION), 2017 (

$160

MILLION), 2018 (

$102

MILLION), 2019 (

$54

MILLION), 2020 (

$56

MILLION) AND AFTER 2020 (

$31

MILLION). MANY OF THESE COMMITMENTS RELATE TO TAKE OR PAY CONTRACTS, IN WHICH 3M GUARANTEES PAYMENT TO ENSURE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT ARE SOLD TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE CONSIDERATION (PRODUCTS OR SERVICES) FOR THESE UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS. THE PURCHASE OBLIGATION AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE ENTIRE ANTICIPATED PURCHASES IN THE FUTURE, BUT REPRESENT ONLY THOSE ITEMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED. THE MAJORITY OF 3M’S PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PURCHASED AS NEEDED, WITH NO UNCONDITIONAL COMMITMENT. FOR THIS REASON, THESE AMOUNTS WILL NOT PROVIDE AN INDICATION OF THE COMPANY’S EXPECTED FUTURE CASH OUTFLOWS RELATED TO PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS.

WARRANTIES/GUARANTEES.

3M’S ACCRUED PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITIES, RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS PART OF CURRENT AND LONG-TERM LIABILITIES, ARE ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY

$28

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, AND

$30

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2014. 3M DOES NOT CONSIDER THIS AMOUNT TO BE MATERIAL. THE FAIR VALUE OF 3M GUARANTEES OF LOANS WITH THIRD PARTIES AND OTHER GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RELATED PARTY ACTIVITY.

3M DOES NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL RELATED PARTY ACTIVITY.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY AND SOME OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS, PRINCIPALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS WORLDWIDE. THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS PRODUCTS LIABILITY (INVOLVING PRODUCTS THAT THE COMPANY NOW OR FORMERLY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD), INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND COMMERCIAL CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS, INCLUDING THOSE BROUGHT UNDER THE ANTITRUST LAWS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS. UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ALL SUCH LITIGATION.

PROCESS FOR DISCLOSURE AND RECORDING OF LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

MANY LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS INVOLVE HIGHLY COMPLEX ISSUES RELATING TO CAUSATION, SCIENTIFIC EVIDENCE, AND WHETHER THERE ARE ACTUAL DAMAGES AND ARE OTHERWISE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL UNCERTAINTIES. ASSESSMENTS OF LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS CAN INVOLVE A SERIES OF COMPLEX JUDGMENTS ABOUT FUTURE EVENTS AND CAN RELY HEAVILY ON ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE COMPANY COMPLIES WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ASC 450,

CONTINGENCIES

, AND RELATED GUIDANCE, AND RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE IT CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS AND WHERE LIABILITY IS PROBABLE. WHERE THE REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABLE LOSS IS A RANGE, THE COMPANY RECORDS THE MOST LIKELY ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS, OR THE LOW END OF THE RANGE IF THERE IS NO ONE BEST ESTIMATE. THE COMPANY EITHER DISCLOSES THE AMOUNT OF A POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF ESTABLISHED ACCRUALS IF ESTIMABLE, OR STATES THAT SUCH AN ESTIMATE CANNOT BE MADE. THE COMPANY DISCLOSES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS EVEN WHERE LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, IF THE COMPANY BELIEVES THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES INSURANCE RECEIVABLES BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ITS NUMEROUS POLICIES, INCLUDING THEIR EXCLUSIONS, PERTINENT CASE LAW INTERPRETING COMPARABLE POLICIES, ITS EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR CLAIMS, AND ASSESSMENT OF THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM AND REMAINING COVERAGE, AND RECORDS AN AMOUNT IT HAS CONCLUDED IS LIKELY TO BE RECOVERED. FOR THOSE INSURED MATTERS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN AN ACCRUAL, THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS RECEIVABLES FOR THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE THAT IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER UNDER THE COMPANY’S INSURANCE PROGRAM. FOR THOSE INSURED MATTERS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS NOT TAKEN AN ACCRUAL BECAUSE THE LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, BUT WHERE THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED AN EXPENSE IN DEFENDING ITSELF, THE COMPANY RECORDS RECEIVABLES FOR THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE THAT IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER FOR THE EXPENSE INCURRED.

BECAUSE LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS OR DEVELOPMENTS COULD OCCUR, THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT THE COMPANY MAY NOT ULTIMATELY INCUR CHARGES IN EXCESS OF PRESENTLY RECORDED LIABILITIES. A FUTURE ADVERSE RULING, SETTLEMENT, OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY’S RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECORDED. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY CANNOT ESTIMATE ITS EXPOSURE TO ALL LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, IT CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT SUCH FUTURE CHARGES, IF ANY, WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY. BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND DEVELOPMENTS, THE COMPANY REEXAMINES ITS ESTIMATES OF PROBABLE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED EXPENSES AND RECEIVABLES EACH PERIOD, AND WHETHER IT IS ABLE TO ESTIMATE A LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED TO BE NOT ESTIMABLE AND/OR NOT PROBABLE. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANY MAKES ADDITIONS TO OR ADJUSTMENTS OF ITS ESTIMATED LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, THE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS FIRST DESCRIBE THE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED, AND THEN DESCRIBE THE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES THE COMPANY HAS ACCRUED RELATING TO ITS SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY IS A NAMED DEFENDANT, WITH MULTIPLE CO-DEFENDANTS, IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS IN VARIOUS COURTS THAT PURPORT TO REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY

2,130

INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS, COMPARED TO APPROXIMATELY

2,220

INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS WITH ACTIONS PENDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2014.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RESOLVED BY AND CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGE USE OF SOME OF THE COMPANY’S MASK AND RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND SEEK DAMAGES FROM THE COMPANY AND OTHER DEFENDANTS FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY FROM WORKPLACE EXPOSURES TO ASBESTOS, SILICA, COAL MINE DUST OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS FOUND IN PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS OR GENERALLY IN THE WORKPLACE. A MINORITY OF THE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RESOLVED BY AND CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY GENERALLY ALLEGE PERSONAL INJURY FROM OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS FROM PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH ARE OFTEN UNSPECIFIED, AS WELL AS PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS, OR OCCASIONALLY AT COMPANY PREMISES.

THE COMPANY’S CURRENT VOLUME OF NEW AND PENDING MATTERS IS SUBSTANTIALLY LOWER THAN IT EXPERIENCED AT THE PEAK OF FILINGS IN 2003. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT FILING OF CLAIMS BY UNIMPAIRED CLAIMANTS IN THE FUTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AT MUCH LOWER LEVELS THAN IN THE PAST. ACCORDINGLY, THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS ALLEGING MORE SERIOUS INJURIES, INCLUDING MESOTHELIOMA AND OTHER MALIGNANCIES, WILL REPRESENT A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CLAIMS THAN IN THE PAST. THE COMPANY HAS PREVAILED IN ALL

TEN

CASES TAKEN TO TRIAL, INCLUDING

EIGHT

OF THE

NINE

CASES

TRIED

TO VERDICT (SUCH TRIALS OCCURRED IN 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004, 2007, AND 2015), AND AN APPELLATE REVERSAL IN 2005 OF THE 2001 JURY VERDICT ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY. THE REMAINING CASE, TRIED IN 2009, WAS DISMISSED BY THE COURT AT THE CLOSE OF PLAINTIFF’S EVIDENCE, BASED ON THE COURT’S LEGAL FINDING THAT THE PLAINTIFF HAD NOT PRESENTED SUFFICIENT EVIDENCE TO SUPPORT A JURY VERDICT.

THE COMPANY HAS DEMONSTRATED IN THESE PAST TRIAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ITS RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS ARE EFFECTIVE AS CLAIMED WHEN USED IN THE INTENDED MANNER AND IN THE INTENDED CIRCUMSTANCES. CONSEQUENTLY THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CLAIMANTS ARE UNABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT THEIR MEDICAL CONDITIONS, EVEN IF SIGNIFICANT, ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY’S RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS. NONETHELESS THE COMPANY’S LITIGATION EXPERIENCE INDICATES THAT CLAIMS OF PERSONS WITH MALIGNANT CONDITIONS ARE COSTLIER TO RESOLVE THAN THE CLAIMS OF UNIMPAIRED PERSONS, AND IT THEREFORE BELIEVES THE AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING PENDING AND FUTURE CLAIMS ON A PER-CLAIM BASIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE HIGHER THAN IT EXPERIENCED IN PRIOR PERIODS WHEN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CLAIMS WERE ASSERTED BY THE UNIMPAIRED.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA, THROUGH ITS ATTORNEY GENERAL, FILED A COMPLAINT IN 2003 AGAINST THE COMPANY AND TWO OTHER MANUFACTURERS OF RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF LINCOLN COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA, AND AMENDED ITS COMPLAINT IN 2005. THE AMENDED COMPLAINT SEEKS SUBSTANTIAL, BUT UNSPECIFIED, COMPENSATORY DAMAGES PRIMARILY FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF THE COSTS ALLEGEDLY INCURRED BY THE STATE FOR WORKER’S COMPENSATION AND HEALTHCARE BENEFITS PROVIDED TO ALL WORKERS WITH OCCUPATIONAL PNEUMOCONIOSIS AND UNSPECIFIED PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE CASE HAS BEEN INACTIVE SINCE THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, OTHER THAN A CASE MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE IN MARCH 2011. IN NOVEMBER 2013, THE STATE FILED A MOTION TO BIFURCATE THE LAWSUIT INTO SEPARATE LIABILITY AND DAMAGES PROCEEDINGS. AT

THE HEARING ON THE MOTION, THE C

OURT DECLINED TO BIFURCATE THE LAWSUIT.

NO

LIABILITY HAS BEEN RECORDED FOR THIS MATTER BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE AT THIS TIME. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE A POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS GIVEN THE LACK OF ANY MEANINGFUL DISCOVERY RESPONSES BY THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA, THE OTHERWISE MINIMAL ACTIVITY IN THIS CASE AND THE FACT THAT THE COMPLAINT ASSERTS CLAIMS AGAINST

TWO

OTHER MANUFACTURERS WHERE A DEFENDANT’S SHARE OF LIABILITY MAY TURN ON THE LAW OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY AND BY THE AMOUNT OF FAULT, IF ANY, A JURY MIGHT ALLOCATE TO EACH DEFENDANT IF THE CASE IS ULTIMATELY TRIED.

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES: THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES, INCLUDING THE COST TO RESOLVE THE CLAIMS AND DEFENSE COSTS, BY EXAMINING: (I) THE COMPANY’S EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING CLAIMS, (II) APPARENT TRENDS, (III) THE APPARENT QUALITY OF CLAIMS (E.G., WHETHER THE CLAIM HAS BEEN ASSERTED ON BEHALF OF ASYMPTOMATIC CLAIMANTS), (IV) CHANGES IN THE NATURE AND MIX OF CLAIMS (E.G., THE PROPORTION OF CLAIMS ASSERTING USAGE OF THE COMPANY’S MASK OR RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND ALLEGING EXPOSURE TO EACH OF ASBESTOS, SILICA, COAL OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS, AND CLAIMS PLEADING USE OF ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCTS ALLEGEDLY MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY), (V) THE NUMBER OF CURRENT CLAIMS AND A PROJECTION OF THE NUMBER OF FUTURE ASBESTOS AND OTHER CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY, (VI) THE COST TO RESOLVE RECENTLY SETTLED CLAIMS, AND (VII) AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST TO RESOLVE AND DEFEND AGAINST CURRENT AND FUTURE CLAIMS.

104

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEVELOPMENTS MAY OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY’S ESTIMATE OF ITS LIABILITIES. THESE DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN (I) THE NUMBER OF FUTURE CLAIMS, (II) THE AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS, (III) THE LEGAL COSTS OF DEFENDING THESE CLAIMS AND IN MAINTAINING TRIAL READINESS, (IV) CHANGES IN THE MIX AND NATURE OF CLAIMS RECEIVED, (V) TRIAL AND APPELLATE OUTCOMES, (VI) CHANGES IN THE LAW AND PROCEDURE APPLICABLE TO THESE CLAIMS, AND (VII) THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER CO-DEFENDANTS AND INSURERS.

AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY’S COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS OF PERSONS WHO CLAIM MORE SERIOUS INJURIES, INCLUDING MESOTHELIOMA AND OTHER MALIGNANCIES, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ACCRUALS IN 2015 FOR RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES BY

$50

MILLION. IN 2015, THE COMPANY MADE PAYMENTS FOR

LEGAL

FEES AND SETTLEMENTS OF

$46

MILLION RELATED TO THE RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD ACCRUALS FOR RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES OF

$144

MILLION (EXCLUDING AEARO ACCRUALS). THIS ACCRUAL REPRESENTS THE LOW END IN A RANGE OF LOSS. THE COMPANY CANNOT ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OR UPPER END OF THE RANGE OF AMOUNTS BY WHICH THE LIABILITY MAY EXCEED THE ACCRUAL THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED BECAUSE OF THE (I) INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN PROJECTING THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ASSERTED OR THE TIME PERIOD IN WHICH FUTURE CLAIMS MAY BE ASSERTED, (II) THE COMPLAINTS NEARLY ALWAYS ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS WHERE THE DAMAGES ALLEGED ARE TYPICALLY NOT ATTRIBUTED TO INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS SO THAT A DEFENDANT’S SHARE OF LIABILITY MAY TURN ON THE LAW OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY, WHICH CAN VARY BY STATE, (III) THE MULTIPLE FACTORS DESCRIBED ABOVE THAT THE COMPANY CONSIDERS IN ESTIMATING ITS LIABILITIES, AND (IV) THE SEVERAL POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE THAT MAY OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY’S ESTIMATE OF LIABILITIES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY’S RECEIVABLE FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO THE RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION WAS

$39

MILLION. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES INSURANCE RECEIVABLES BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ITS POLICIES, INCLUDING THEIR EXCLUSIONS, PERTINENT CASE LAW INTERPRETING COMPARABLE POLICIES, ITS EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR CLAIMS, AND AN ASSESSMENT OF THE NATURE OF EACH CLAIM AND REMAINING COVERAGE. THE COMPANY THEN RECORDS AN AMOUNT IT HAS CONCLUDED IS LIKELY TO BE RECOVERED. VARIOUS FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF RECOVERY OF THIS RECEIVABLE, INCLUDING (I) DELAYS IN OR AVOIDANCE OF PAYMENT BY INSURERS; (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH INSURERS MAY BECOME INSOLVENT IN THE FUTURE, AND (III) THE OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH INSURERS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE.

THE COMPANY HAS UNRESOLVED COVERAGE WITH CLAIMS-MADE CARRIERS FOR RESPIRATOR MASK CLAIMS. THE COMPANY IS ALSO SEEKING COVERAGE UNDER THE POLICIES OF CERTAIN INSOLVENT INSURERS. ONCE THOSE CLAIMS FOR COVERAGE ARE RESOLVED, THE COMPANY WILL HAVE COLLECTED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS REMAINING INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS CLAIMS.

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION — AEARO TECHNOLOGIES

ON APRIL 1, 2008, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY PURCHASED THE STOCK OF AEARO HOLDING CORP., THE PARENT OF AEARO TECHNOLOGIES (“AEARO”). AEARO MANUFACTURED AND SOLD VARIOUS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PERSONAL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS EYE, EAR, HEAD, FACE, FALL AND CERTAIN RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, AEARO AND/OR OTHER COMPANIES THAT PREVIOUSLY OWNED AND OPERATED AEARO’S RESPIRATOR BUSINESS (AMERICAN OPTICAL CORPORATION, WARNER-LAMBERT LLC, AO CORP. AND CABOT CORPORATION (“CABOT”)) ARE NAMED DEFENDANTS, WITH MULTIPLE CO-DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS IN VARIOUS COURTS IN WHICH PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE USE OF MASK AND RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND SEEK DAMAGES FROM AEARO AND OTHER DEFENDANTS FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY FROM WORKPLACE EXPOSURES TO ASBESTOS, SILICA-RELATED, OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS FOUND IN PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS OR GENERALLY IN THE WORKPLACE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS AEARO SUBSIDIARY, HAD ACCRUALS OF

$21

MILLION FOR PRODUCT LIABILITIES AND DEFENSE COSTS RELATED TO CURRENT AND FUTURE AEARO-RELATED ASBESTOS AND SILICA-RELATED CLAIMS. RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEGAL COSTS, AS WELL AS FOR SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS, IS CURRENTLY SHARED IN AN INFORMAL ARRANGEMENT AMONG AEARO, CABOT, AMERICAN OPTICAL CORPORATION AND A SUBSIDIARY OF WARNER LAMBERT AND THEIR RESPECTIVE INSURERS (THE “PAYOR GROUP”). LIABILITY IS ALLOCATED AMONG THE PARTIES BASED ON THE NUMBER OF YEARS EACH COMPANY SOLD RESPIRATORY PRODUCTS UNDER THE “AO SAFETY” BRAND AND/OR OWNED THE AO SAFETY DIVISION OF AMERICAN OPTICAL CORPORATION AND THE ALLEGED YEARS OF EXPOSURE OF THE INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFF. AEARO’S SHARE OF THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY IS FURTHER LIMITED BY AN AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN AEARO AND CABOT ON JULY 11, 1995. THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT, SO LONG AS AEARO PAYS TO CABOT A

105

QUARTERLY FEE OF

$100,000

, CABOT WILL RETAIN RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR, AND INDEMNIFY AEARO AGAINST, ANY PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS INVOLVING EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS, SILICA, OR  SILICA PRODUCTS FOR RESPIRATORS SOLD PRIOR TO JULY 11, 1995. BECAUSE OF THE DIFFICULTY IN DETERMINING HOW LONG A PARTICULAR RESPIRATOR REMAINS IN THE STREAM OF COMMERCE AFTER BEING SOLD, AEARO AND CABOT HAVE APPLIED THE AGREEMENT TO CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THE ALLEGED USE OF RESPIRATORS INVOLVING EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS, SILICA OR SILICA PRODUCTS PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 1997. WITH THESE ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE, AEARO’S POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO EXPOSURES ALLEGED TO HAVE ARISEN FROM THE USE OF RESPIRATORS INVOLVING EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS, SILICA, OR SILICA PRODUCTS ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 1997. TO DATE, AEARO HAS ELECTED TO PAY THE QUARTERLY FEE. AEARO COULD POTENTIALLY BE EXPOSED TO ADDITIONAL CLAIMS FOR SOME PART OF THE PRE-JULY 11, 1995 PERIOD COVERED BY ITS AGREEMENT WITH CABOT IF AEARO ELECTS TO DISCONTINUE ITS PARTICIPATION IN THIS ARRANGEMENT, OR IF CABOT IS NO LONGER ABLE TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS IN THESE MATTERS.

IN MARCH 2012, CABOT CSC CORPORATION AND CABOT CORPORATION FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST AEARO IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF SUFFOLK COUNTY, MASSACHUSETTS SEEKING DECLARATORY RELIEF AS TO THE SCOPE OF CABOT’S INDEMNITY OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE JULY 11, 1995 AGREEMENT, INCLUDING WHETHER CABOT HAS RETAINED LIABILITY FOR COAL WORKERS’ PNEUMOCONIOSIS CLAIMS, AND SEEKING DAMAGES FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT. IN JUNE 2014, THE COURT GRANTED AEARO’S MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON ALL CLAIMS. CABOT HAS FILED A MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION, AND AEARO FILED A MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION OF THE COURT’S ORDER GRANTING AEARO SUMMARY JUDGMENT. IN OCTOBER 2014, THE COURT DENIED AEARO’S MOTION FOR CLARIFICATION. THE COURT ALSO DENIED, IN PART, CABOT’S MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION AND REAFFIRMED ITS RULING THAT CABOT RETAINED LIABILITY FOR CLAIMS INVOLVING EXPOSURE TO SILICA IN COAL MINE DUST. THE COURT GRANTED CABOT’S MOTION, IN PART, RULING THAT AEARO WAS NOT ENTITLED TO SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON CABOT’S CLAIM FOR EQUITABLE ALLOCATION, AND ON WHETHER THE

258

UNDERLYING CLAIMS WERE CABOT’S RESPONSIBILITY. THESE

TWO

ISSUES REMAIN IN THE CASE FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. NEW MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT WERE FILED AND THE COURT HEARD ORAL ARGUMENTS IN OCTOBER 2015.

DEVELOPMENTS MAY OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE ESTIMATE OF AEARO’S LIABILITIES. THESE DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: (I) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF FUTURE CLAIMS, (II) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS, (III) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL COSTS OF DEFENDING THESE CLAIMS, (IV) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE MIX AND NATURE OF CLAIMS RECEIVED, (V) TRIAL AND APPELLATE OUTCOMES, (VI) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE LAW AND PROCEDURE APPLICABLE TO THESE CLAIMS, (VII) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE LIABILITY ALLOCATION AMONG THE CO-DEFENDANTS, (VIII) THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF MEMBERS OF THE PAYOR GROUP INCLUDING EXHAUSTION OF AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE LIMITS, AND/OR (IX) A DETERMINATION THAT THE INTERPRETATION OF THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ON WHICH AEARO HAS ESTIMATED ITS SHARE OF LIABILITY IS INACCURATE. THE COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF THESE POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS ON ITS CURRENT ESTIMATE OF AEARO’S SHARE OF LIABILITY FOR THESE EXISTING AND FUTURE CLAIMS. IF ANY OF THE DEVELOPMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE WERE TO OCCUR, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE LIABILITIES FOR EXISTING AND FUTURE CLAIMS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE AMOUNT ACCRUED.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN PROJECTING THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ASSERTED, THE COMPLEXITY OF ALLOCATING RESPONSIBILITY FOR FUTURE CLAIMS AMONG THE PAYOR GROUP, AND THE SEVERAL POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAY OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE ESTIMATE OF AEARO’S LIABILITIES, THE COMPANY CANNOT ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OR RANGE OF AMOUNTS BY WHICH AEARO’S LIABILITY MAY EXCEED THE ACCRUAL THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND LITIGATION

THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDING THOSE PERTAINING TO AIR EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER DISCHARGES, TOXIC SUBSTANCES, AND THE HANDLING AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTES ENFORCEABLE BY NATIONAL, STATE, AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AROUND THE WORLD, AND PRIVATE PARTIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS PROVIDE, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A BASIS FOR THE REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATION, FOR RESTORATION OF OR COMPENSATION FOR DAMAGES TO NATURAL RESOURCES, AND FOR PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS. THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR, COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN COMPLYING WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, DEFENDING PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS, AND MODIFYING ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN LIGHT OF ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES. IN ITS EFFORT TO SATISFY ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED, AND PERIODICALLY UPDATES, POLICIES RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR ITS OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE.

UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980 AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY MAY BE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE, TYPICALLY WITH OTHER

106

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPANIES, FOR THE COSTS OF REMEDIATION OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AT CURRENT OR FORMER FACILITIES AND AT OFF-SITE LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS LOCATIONS, MOST OF WHICH ARE IN THE UNITED STATES, AT WHICH IT MAY HAVE SOME LIABILITY. PLEASE REFER TO THE SECTION ENTITLED “

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES”

THAT FOLLOWS

FOR INFORMATION ON THE AMOUNT OF THE ACCRUAL.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN VOLUNTARILY COOPERATING WITH ONGOING REVIEWS BY LOCAL, STATE, FEDERAL (PRIMARILY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)), AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES OF POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH EFFECTS OF VARIOUS PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS (“PFCS”), INCLUDING PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS SUCH AS PERFLUOROOCTANOATE (“PFOA”) AND PERFLUOROOCTANE SULFONATE (“PFOS”). AS A RESULT OF ITS PHASE-OUT DECISION IN MAY 2000, THE COMPANY NO LONGER MANUFACTURES PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS. THE COMPANY CEASED MANUFACTURING AND USING THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE COMPOUNDS WITHIN APPROXIMATELY

TWO

YEARS OF THE PHASE-OUT ANNOUNCEMENT, AND CEASED ALL MANUFACTURING AND THE LAST SIGNIFICANT USE OF THIS CHEMISTRY BY THE END OF 2008. THROUGH ITS ONGOING LIFE CYCLE MANAGEMENT AND ITS RAW MATERIAL COMPOSITION IDENTIFICATION PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY’S POLICIES COVERING THE USE OF ALL PERSISTENT AND BIO-ACCUMULATIVE MATERIALS, THE COMPANY HAS ON OCCASION IDENTIFIED THE PRESENCE OF PRECURSOR CHEMICALS IN MATERIALS RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS THAT MAY ULTIMATELY DEGRADE TO PFOA, PFOS, OR SIMILAR COMPOUNDS. UPON SUCH IDENTIFICATION, THE COMPANY WORKS TO FIND ALTERNATIVES FOR SUCH MATERIALS.

REGULATORY ACTIVITIES CONCERNING PFOA AND/OR PFOS CONTINUE IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, AND BEFORE CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL BODIES. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE GATHERING OF EXPOSURE AND USE INFORMATION, RISK ASSESSMENT, AND CONSIDERATION OF REGULATORY APPROACHES. AS THE DATABASE OF STUDIES OF BOTH CHEMICALS HAS EXPANDED, THE EPA HAS DEVELOPED DRAFT HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS DOCUMENTS SUMMARIZING THE AVAILABLE DATA FROM THESE STUDIES. IN FEBRUARY 2014, THE EPA INITIATED EXTERNAL PEER REVIEW OF ITS DRAFT HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS DOCUMENTS FOR PFOA AND PFOS. THE PEER REVIEW PANEL MET IN AUGUST 2014. THE EPA HAS STATED THAT FOLLOWING THE PEER REVIEW PROCESS IT WILL REVISE ITS HEALTH EFFECTS DOCUMENTS AND USE THEM TO ESTABLISH LIFETIME HEALTH ADVISORIES FOR PFOS AND PFOA IN DRINKING WATER. LIFETIME HEALTH ADVISORIES, WHILE NOT ENFORCEABLE, SERVE AS GUIDANCE AND ARE BENCHMARKS FOR DETERMINING IF CONCENTRATIONS OF CHEMICALS IN TAP WATER FROM PUBLIC UTILITIES ARE SAFE FOR PUBLIC CONSUMPTION. ONCE FINALIZED, THE EPA STATED THAT THE LIFETIME HEALTH ADVISORIES ARE EXPECTED TO SUPERSEDE THE PROVISIONAL HEALTH ADVISORIES FOR PFOA AND PFOS IN DRINKING WATER ISSUED BY THE EPA IN 2009 — CURRENTLY AT

0.4

MICROGRAMS PER LITER FOR PFOA AND

0.2

MICROGRAMS PER LITER FOR PFOS. IN AN EFFORT TO COLLECT EXPOSURE INFORMATION UNDER THE SAFE DRINKING WATER ACT, THE EPA PUBLISHED ON MAY 2, 2012 A LIST OF UNREGULATED SUBSTANCES, INCLUDING

SIX

PFCS, REQUIRED TO BE MONITORED DURING THE PERIOD 2013-2015 BY PUBLIC WATER SYSTEM SUPPLIES TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THEIR OCCURRENCE.

THE

EPA IS REPORTING RESULTS FROM THIS EXERCISE ON A ROLLING BASIS THAT WILL CONTINUE IN 2016. THROUGH YEAR-END 2015,

THE

EPA HAS REPORTED RESULTS FOR

4,764

PUBLIC WATER SUPPLIES NATIONWIDE.

NONE

OF THESE HAVE REPORTED PFOA ABOVE THE PROVISIONAL HEALTH ADVISORY LEVEL ISSUED BY

THE

EPA IN 2009, AND

SEVENTEEN

HAVE REPORTED PFOS LEVELS ABOVE THE 2009 PROVISIONAL HEALTH ADVISORY.

THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO MAKE PROGRESS IN ITS WORK, UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF STATE REGULATORS, TO ADDRESS ITS HISTORIC DISPOSAL OF PFC-CONTAINING WASTE ASSOCIATED WITH MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AT THE DECATUR, ALABAMA, COTTAGE GROVE, MINNESOTA, AND CORDOVA, ILLINOIS PLANTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A VOLUNTARY REMEDIAL ACTION AGREEMENT WITH THE ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT (ADEM) TO ADDRESS THE PRESENCE OF PFCS IN THE SOIL AT THE COMPANY’S MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN DECATUR, ALABAMA. PURSUANT TO A PERMIT ISSUED BY ADEM, FOR APPROXIMATELY

TWENTY

YEARS, THE COMPANY INCORPORATED ITS WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT SLUDGE CONTAINING PFCS IN FIELDS AT ITS DECATUR FACILITY. AFTER A REVIEW OF THE AVAILABLE OPTIONS TO ADDRESS THE PRESENCE OF PFCS IN THE SOIL, ADEM AGREED THAT THE PREFERRED REMEDIATION OPTION IS TO USE A MULTILAYER CAP OVER THE FORMER SLUDGE INCORPORATION AREAS ON THE MANUFACTURING SITE WITH SUBSEQUENT GROUNDWATER MIGRATION CONTROLS AND TREATMENT. IMPLEMENTATION OF THAT OPTION WILL CONTINUE AND IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN 2018.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO WORK WITH THE MINNESOTA POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY (MPCA) PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED MAY 2007 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND CONSENT ORDER TO ADDRESS THE PRESENCE OF CERTAIN PFCS IN THE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER AT FORMER DISPOSAL SITES IN WASHINGTON COUNTY, MINNESOTA (OAKDALE AND WOODBURY) AND AT THE COMPANY’S MANUFACTURING FACILITY AT COTTAGE GROVE, MINNESOTA. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY’S PRINCIPAL OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE (I) EVALUATING RELEASES OF CERTAIN PFCS FROM THESE SITES AND PROPOSING RESPONSE ACTIONS; (II) PROVIDING

107

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TREATMENT OR ALTERNATIVE DRINKING WATER UPON IDENTIFYING ANY LEVEL EXCEEDING A HEALTH BASED VALUE (“HBV”) OR HEALTH RISK LIMIT (“HRL”) (I.E., THE AMOUNT OF A CHEMICAL IN DRINKING WATER DETERMINED BY THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (MDH) TO BE SAFE FOR HUMAN CONSUMPTION OVER A LIFETIME) FOR CERTAIN PFCS  FOR WHICH A HBV AND/OR HRL EXISTS AS A RESULT OF CONTAMINATION FROM THESE SITES; (III) REMEDIATING IDENTIFIED SOURCES OF OTHER PFCS AT THESE SITES THAT ARE NOT CONTROLLED BY ACTIONS TO REMEDIATE PFOA AND PFOS; AND (IV) SHARING INFORMATION WITH THE MPCA ABOUT CERTAIN PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS. DURING 2008, THE MPCA ISSUED FORMAL DECISIONS ADOPTING REMEDIAL OPTIONS FOR THE FORMER DISPOSAL SITES IN WASHINGTON COUNTY, MINNESOTA (OAKDALE AND WOODBURY). IN AUGUST 2009, THE MPCA ISSUED A FORMAL DECISION ADOPTING REMEDIAL OPTIONS FOR THE COMPANY’S COTTAGE GROVE MANUFACTURING FACILITY. DURING THE SPRING AND SUMMER OF 2010, 3M BEGAN IMPLEMENTING THE AGREED UPON REMEDIAL OPTIONS AT THE COTTAGE GROVE AND WOODBURY SITES. 3M COMMENCED THE REMEDIAL OPTION AT THE OAKDALE SITE IN LATE 2010. AT EACH LOCATION THE REMEDIAL OPTIONS WERE RECOMMENDED BY THE COMPANY AND APPROVED BY THE MPCA. REMEDIATION WORK HAS BEEN COMPLETED AT THE OAKDALE AND WOODBURY SITES, AND THEY ARE IN AN OPERATIONAL MAINTENANCE MODE. REMEDIATION WILL CONTINUE AT THE COTTAGE GROVE SITE DURING 2016.

IN AUGUST 2014, THE ILLINOIS EPA APPROVED A REQUEST BY THE COMPANY TO ESTABLISH A GROUNDWATER MANAGEMENT ZONE AT ITS MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN CORDOVA, ILLINOIS, WHICH INCLUDES ONGOING PUMPING OF IMPACTED SITE GROUNDWATER, GROUNDWATER MONITORING AND ROUTINE REPORTING OF RESULTS.

THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHAT ADDITIONAL REGULATORY ACTIONS ARISING FROM THE FOREGOING PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIVITIES, IF ANY, MAY BE TAKEN REGARDING SUCH COMPOUNDS OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH ACTIONS.

ENVIRONMENTAL LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, A FORMER EMPLOYEE FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN 2002 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA (THE “ST. JOHN” CASE), SEEKING UNSTATED DAMAGES AND ALLEGING THAT THE PLAINTIFFS SUFFERED FEAR, INCREASED RISK, SUBCLINICAL INJURIES, AND PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM EXPOSURE TO CERTAIN PERFLUOROCHEMICALS AT OR NEAR THE COMPANY’S DECATUR, ALABAMA, MANUFACTURING FACILITY. THE COURT IN 2005 GRANTED THE COMPANY’S MOTION TO DISMISS THE NAMED PLAINTIFF’S PERSONAL INJURY-RELATED CLAIMS ON THE BASIS THAT SUCH CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE EXCLUSIVITY PROVISIONS OF THE STATE’S WORKERS COMPENSATION ACT. THE PLAINTIFFS’ COUNSEL FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT IN NOVEMBER 2006, LIMITING THE CASE TO PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF A PURPORTED CLASS OF RESIDENTS AND PROPERTY OWNERS IN THE VICINITY OF THE DECATUR PLANT.

IN JUNE 2015, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT ADDING ADDITIONAL DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING BFI WASTE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS OF ALABAMA, LLC; BFI WASTE MANAGEMENT OF NORTH AMERICA, LLC; THE CITY OF DECATUR, ALABAMA; MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA; MUNICIPAL UTILITIES BOARD OF DECATUR; AND MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA, D/B/A DECATUR UTILITIES. IN SEPTEMBER 2015, THE COURT ISSUED A SCHEDULING ORDER STAYING DISCOVERY PENDING MEDIATION WHICH OCCURRED IN JANUARY 2016, BUT DID NOT RESOLVE THE CASE. DISCOVERY RELATING TO THE CLASS CERTIFICATION WILL BEGIN, AND THE CLASS CERTIFICATION HEARING IS SCHEDULED FOR NOVEMBER 2016.

IN 2005, THE JUDGE IN A SECOND PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FILED BY

THREE

RESIDENTS OF MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA, SEEKING UNSTATED COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES INVOLVING ALLEGED DAMAGE TO THEIR PROPERTY FROM EMISSIONS OF CERTAIN PERFLUOROCHEMICAL COMPOUNDS FROM THE COMPANY’S DECATUR, ALABAMA, MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT FORMERLY MANUFACTURED THOSE COMPOUNDS (THE “CHANDLER” CASE) GRANTED THE COMPANY’S MOTION TO ABATE THE CASE, EFFECTIVELY PUTTING THE CASE ON HOLD PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF CLASS CERTIFICATION ISSUES IN THE ST. JOHN CASE. DESPITE THE STAY, PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT SEEKING DAMAGES FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE ON BEHALF OF THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS AND THE MEMBERS OF A PURPORTED CLASS. NO FURTHER ACTION IN THE CASE IS EXPECTED UNLESS AND UNTIL THE STAY IS LIFTED.

IN FEBRUARY 2009, A RESIDENT OF FRANKLIN COUNTY, ALABAMA, FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF FRANKLIN COUNTY (THE “STOVER” CASE) SEEKING COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF BASED ON THE APPLICATION BY THE DECATUR UTILITY’S WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT OF WASTEWATER TREATMENT SLUDGE TO FARMLAND AND GRASSLANDS IN THE STATE THAT ALLEGEDLY CONTAIN PFOA, PFOS AND OTHER PERFLUOROCHEMICALS. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF SEEKS TO REPRESENT A CLASS OF ALL PERSONS WITHIN THE STATE OF ALABAMA WHO HAVE HAD PFOA, PFOS, AND OTHER PERFLUOROCHEMICALS RELEASED OR DEPOSITED ON THEIR PROPERTY. IN MARCH 2010, THE ALABAMA SUPREME COURT ORDERED THE CASE TRANSFERRED FROM FRANKLIN COUNTY TO MORGAN COUNTY. IN MAY 2010, CONSISTENT WITH ITS HANDLING OF THE OTHER MATTERS, THE MORGAN COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT ABATED THIS CASE, PUTTING IT ON HOLD PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF THE CLASS CERTIFICATION ISSUES IN THE ST. JOHN CASE.

IN OCTOBER 2015, WEST MORGAN-EAST LAWRENCE WATER & SEWER AUTHORITY (“WATER AUTHORITY”) FILED AN INDIVIDUAL COMPLAINT AGAINST 3M COMPANY, DYNEON, L.L.C, AND DAIKIN AMERICA, INC., IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA.  THE COMPLAINT ALSO INCLUDES REPRESENTATIVE PLAINTIFFS WHO BROUGHT THE COMPLAINT ON BEHALF OF THEMSELVES, AND A CLASS OF ALL OWNERS AND POSSESSORS OF PROPERTY WHO USE WATER PROVIDED BY THE WATER AUTHORITY AND

FIVE

LOCAL WATER WORKS TO WHICH THE WATER AUTHORITY SUPPLIES WATER (COLLECTIVELY, THE “WATER UTILITIES”).  THE COMPLAINT SEEKS COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIVE RELIEF BASED ON ALLEGATIONS THAT THE DEFENDANTS’ CHEMICALS, INCLUDING PFOA AND PFOS FROM THEIR MANUFACTURING PROCESSES IN DECATUR, HAVE CONTAMINATED THE WATER IN THE TENNESSEE RIVER AT THE WATER INTAKE, AND THAT THE CHEMICALS CANNOT BE REMOVED BY THE WATER TREATMENT PROCESSES UTILIZED BY THE WATER AUTHORITY.

IN DECEMBER 2010, THE STATE OF MINNESOTA, BY ITS ATTORNEY GENERAL LORI SWANSON, ACTING IN ITS CAPACITY AS TRUSTEE OF THE NATURAL RESOURCES OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA, FILED A LAWSUIT IN HENNEPIN COUNTY DISTRICT COURT AGAINST 3M TO RECOVER DAMAGES (INCLUDING UNSPECIFIED ASSESSMENT COSTS AND REASONABLE ATTORNEY’S FEES) FOR ALLEGED INJURY TO, DESTRUCTION OF, AND LOSS OF USE OF CERTAIN OF THE STATE’S NATURAL RESOURCES UNDER THE MINNESOTA ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE AND LIABILITY ACT (MERLA) AND THE MINNESOTA WATER POLLUTION CONTROL ACT (MWPCA), AS WELL AS STATUTORY NUISANCE AND COMMON LAW CLAIMS OF TRESPASS, NUISANCE, AND NEGLIGENCE WITH RESPECT TO THE PRESENCE OF PFCS IN THE GROUNDWATER, SURFACE WATER, FISH OR OTHER AQUATIC LIFE, AND SEDIMENTS (THE “NRD LAWSUIT”). THE STATE ALSO SEEKS DECLARATIONS UNDER MERLA THAT 3M IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR ALL DAMAGES THE STATE MAY SUFFER IN THE FUTURE FOR INJURIES TO NATURAL RESOURCES FROM RELEASES OF PFCS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT, AND UNDER MWPCA THAT 3M IS RESPONSIBLE FOR COMPENSATION FOR FUTURE LOSS OR DESTRUCTION OF FISH, AQUATIC LIFE, AND OTHER DAMAGES.

IN NOVEMBER 2011, THE

METROPOLITAN COUNCIL FILED A MOTION TO INTERVENE AND A COMPLAINT IN THE NRD LAWSUIT SEEKING COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND OTHER LEGAL, DECLARATORY AND EQUITABLE RELIEF, INCLUDING REASONABLE ATTORNEYS’ FEES, FOR COSTS AND FEES THAT THE METROPOLITAN COUNCIL ALLEGES IT WILL BE REQUIRED TO ASSESS AT SOME TIME IN THE FUTURE IF THE MPCA IMPOSES RESTRICTIONS ON METROPOLITAN COUNCIL’S PFOS DISCHARGES TO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER, INCLUDING THE INSTALLATION AND MAINTENANCE OF A WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM. THE METROPOLITAN

COUNCIL’S INTERVENTION MOTION WAS BASED ON SEVERAL THEORIES, INCLUDING COMMON LAW NEGLIGENCE, AND STATUTORY CLAIMS UNDER MERLA FOR RESPONSE COSTS, AND UNDER THE MINNESOTA ENVIRONMENTAL RIGHTS ACT (MERA) FOR DECLARATORY AND EQUITABLE RELIEF AGAINST 3M FOR PFOS AND OTHER PFC POLLUTION OF THE WATERS AND SEDIMENTS OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. 3M DID NOT OBJECT TO THE MOTION TO INTERVENE. IN JANUARY 2012, 3M ANSWERED THE METROPOLITAN COUNCIL’S COMPLAINT AND FILED A COUNTERCLAIM ALLEGING THAT THE METROPOLITAN COUNCIL DISCHARGES PFCS TO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND DISCHARGES PFC-CONTAINING SLUDGE AND BIO SOLIDS FROM

ONE

OR MORE OF ITS WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANTS ONTO AGRICULTURAL LANDS AND LOCAL AREA LANDFILLS. ACCORDINGLY, 3M REQUESTED THAT IF THE COURT FINDS THAT THE STATE IS ENTITLED TO ANY OF THE DAMAGES THE STATE SEEKS, 3M SEEKS CONTRIBUTION AND APPORTIONMENT FROM THE METROPOLITAN COUNCIL, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS’ FEES, UNDER MERLA, AND CONTRIBUTION FROM AND LIABILITY FOR THE METROPOLITAN COUNCIL’S PROPORTIONAL SHARE OF DAMAGES AWARDED TO THE STATE UNDER THE MWPCA, AS WELL AS UNDER STATUTORY NUISANCE AND COMMON LAW THEORIES OF TRESPASS, NUISANCE, AND NEGLIGENCE. 3M ALSO SEEKS DECLARATORY RELIEF UNDER MERA.

IN APRIL 2012, 3M FILED A MOTION TO DISQUALIFY THE STATE OF MINNESOTA’S COUNSEL, COVINGTON & BURLING, LLP (COVINGTON). IN OCTOBER 2012, THE COURT GRANTED 3M’S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY COVINGTON AS COUNSEL TO THE STATE AND THE STATE AND COVINGTON APPEALED THE COURT’S DISQUALIFICATION TO THE MINNESOTA COURT OF APPEALS. IN JULY 2013, THE MINNESOTA COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED THE DISTRICT COURT’S DISQUALIFICATION ORDER. IN OCTOBER 2013, THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT GRANTED BOTH THE STATE’S AND COVINGTON’S PETITION FOR REVIEW OF THE DECISION OF THE MINNESOTA COURT OF APPEALS. IN APRIL 2014, THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. THE DISTRICT COURT TOOK EVIDENCE ON THE DISQUALIFICATION ISSUES AT A HEARING IN OCTOBER 2015.

IN FEBRUARY 2016, THE DISTRICT COURT RULED THAT COVINGTON VIOLATED THE PROFESSIONAL ETHICS RULE AGAINST REPRESENTING A CLIENT (HERE THE STATE OF MINNESOTA) IN THE SAME OR SUBSTANTIALLY RELATED MATTER WHERE THAT PERSON’S INTERESTS ARE MATERIALLY ADVERSE TO THE INTERESTS OF A FORMER CLIENT (3M). THE DISTRICT COURT, HOWEVER, DENIED 3M’S MOTION TO DISQUALIFY COVINGTON BECAUSE IT FURTHER FOUND THAT 3M IMPLIEDLY WAIVED BY DELAYING TO ASSERT THE CONFLICT. 3M IS REVIEWING THE DISTRICT COURT’S OPINION TO DETERMINE NEXT STEPS.

OTHER ACTIVITY IN THE CASE HA

D

BEEN STAYED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE DISQUALIFICATION ISSUE. IN A SEPARATE BUT RELATED ACTION, THE COMPANY FILED SUIT AGAINST COVINGTON FOR BREACH OF ITS FIDUCIARY DUTIES TO THE COMPANY AND FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT ARISING OUT OF COVINGTON’S REPRESENTATION OF THE STATE OF MINNESOTA IN THE NRD LAWSUIT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR ENVIRONMENTAL LITIGATION MATTERS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION FOR WHICH A LIABILITY, IF ANY, HAS BEEN RECORDED, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE AMOUNT RECORDED, AS WELL AS THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF THE ESTABLISHED ACCRUAL IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. FOR THOSE MATTERS FOR WHICH A LIABILITY HAS NOT BEEN RECORDED, THE COMPANY BELIEVES ANY SUCH LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE AND THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE A POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS AT THIS TIME.

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD RECORDED LIABILITIES OF

$43

MILLION FOR ESTIMATED “ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION” COSTS BASED UPON AN EVALUATION OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FACTS WITH RESPECT TO EACH INDIVIDUAL SITE AND ALSO RECORDED RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES OF

$11

MILLION. THE COMPANY RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION COSTS ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES OR THE COMPANY’S COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION. LIABILITIES FOR ESTIMATED COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, DEPENDING ON THE SITE, ARE BASED PRIMARILY UPON INTERNAL OR THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, AND ESTIMATES AS TO THE NUMBER, PARTICIPATION LEVEL AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF ANY OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION AND THE NATURE OF REQUIRED REMEDIAL ACTIONS. THE COMPANY ADJUSTS RECORDED LIABILITIES AS FURTHER INFORMATION DEVELOPS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT IT WILL PAY THE AMOUNTS RECORDED OVER THE PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE APPLICABLE SITES, CURRENTLY RANGING UP TO

20

YEARS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY HAD RECORDED LIABILITIES OF

$35

MILLION FOR “OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES” BASED UPON AN EVALUATION OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FACTS TO IMPLEMENT THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND CONSENT ORDER WITH THE MPCA, THE REMEDIAL ACTION AGREEMENT WITH ADEM, AND TO ADDRESS TRACE AMOUNTS OF PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES IN THE CITY OF OAKDALE, MINNESOTA, AS WELL AS PRESENCE IN THE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER AT THE COMPANY’S MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN DECATUR, ALABAMA, AND COTTAGE GROVE, MINNESOTA, AND AT

TWO

FORMER DISPOSAL SITES IN WASHINGTON COUNTY, MINNESOTA (OAKDALE AND WOODBURY). THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT MOST OF THE SPENDING WILL OCCUR OVER THE NEXT

FOUR

YEARS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY’S RECEIVABLE FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO “OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES” WAS

$15

MILLION.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND REMEDIATION GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE EXTENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND THE EXISTENCE OF ALTERNATIVE CLEANUP METHODS. DEVELOPMENTS MAY OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY’S CURRENT ASSESSMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (I) CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE COMPANY’S OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS; (II) CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, CHANGES IN PERMISSIBLE LEVELS OF SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES, OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT THEORIES AND POLICIES, INCLUDING EFFORTS TO RECOVER NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES; (III) NEW AND EVOLVING ANALYTICAL AND REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES; (IV) SUCCESS IN ALLOCATING LIABILITY TO OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES; AND (V) THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND THIRD-PARTY INDEMNITORS. FOR SITES INCLUDED IN BOTH “ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION LIABILITIES” AND “OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES,” AT WHICH REMEDIATION ACTIVITY IS LARGELY COMPLETE AND REMAINING ACTIVITY RELATES PRIMARILY TO OPERATION AND MAINTENANCE OF THE REMEDY, INCLUDING REQUIRED POST-REMEDIATION MONITORING, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE EXPOSURE TO LOSS IN EXCESS OF THE AMOUNT ACCRUED WOULD NOT BE MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. HOWEVER, FOR LOCATIONS AT WHICH REMEDIATION ACTIVITY IS LARGELY ONGOING, THE COMPANY CANNOT ESTIMATE A POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF THE ASSOCIATED ESTABLISHED ACCRUALS FOR THE REASONS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

OTHER MATTERS

COMMERCIAL LITIGATION

3M SUED TRANSWEB CORPORATION IN MINNESOTA IN 2010 FOR INFRINGEMENT OF SEVERAL 3M PATENTS COVERING FLUORINATION AND HYDROCHARGING OF FILTER MEDIA USED IN 3M’S RESPIRATORS AND FURNACE FILTERS. TRANSWEB FILED A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION IN AND SUCCESSFULLY MOVED THE LITIGATION TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY, SEEKING A DECLARATION OF INVALIDITY AND NON-INFRINGEMENT OF 3M’S PATENTS, AND FURTHER ALLEGING THAT 3M WAITED TOO LONG TO ENFORCE ITS RIGHTS. TRANSWEB ALSO ALLEGED 3M OBTAINED THE PATENTS THROUGH INEQUITABLE CONDUCT AND THAT 3M’S ATTEMPT TO ENFORCE THE PATENTS CONSTITUTED A VIOLATION OF THE ANTITRUST LAWS. IN NOVEMBER 2012, A JURY RETURNED A VERDICT IN FAVOR OF TRANSWEB ON ALL BUT

110

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ONE

COUNT, INCLUDING FINDINGS THAT 3M’S PATENTS WERE INVALID AND NOT INFRINGED, AND THAT 3M HAD COMMITTED AN ANTITRUST VIOLATION BY SEEKING TO ENFORCE A PATENT IT HAD OBTAINED FRAUDULENTLY. THE JURY ALSO RECOMMENDED THAT THE COURT FIND 3M HAD COMMITTED INEQUITABLE CONDUCT IN OBTAINING THE PATENTS, AND THAT THE PATENTS WERE THEREFORE UNENFORCEABLE. SINCE THE VAST MAJORITY OF TRANSWEB’S CLAIM FOR TREBLE ANTITRUST DAMAGES WAS IN THE FORM OF ITS ATTORNEYS’ FEES AND EXPENSES IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEFENSE OF THE PATENT CASE, THE PARTIES AGREED THAT THE MEASURE OF DAMAGES WOULD NOT GO TO THE JURY, BUT RATHER WOULD BE SUBMITTED TO A SPECIAL MASTER AFTER THE TRIAL.

I

N APRIL, 2014, THE COURT ISSUED AN ORDER DENYING 3M’S MOTIONS TO SET ASIDE THE JURY’S VERDICT. IN ADDITION, THE COURT FOUND

TWO

3M PATENTS UNENFORCEABLE DUE TO INEQUITABLE CONDUCT. THE COURT ACCEPTED THE SPECIAL MASTER’S RECOMMENDATION AS TO THE AMOUNT OF ATTORNEYS’ FEES TO BE AWARDED AS DAMAGES, AND ENTERED JUDGMENT AGAINST 3M IN THE AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY

$26

MILLION. IN JULY 2014, 3M FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL OF THE JUDGMENT TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT.

ON FEBRUARY 10, 2016, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT ISSUED ITS DECISION AFFIRMING THE LOWER COURT’S JUDGMENT. 3M IS REVIEWING THE APPELLATE COURT’S DECISION TO DETERMINE NEXT STEPS. THE IMPACT OF THE APPELLATE COURT’S DECISION IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FILED

A LAWSUIT AGAINST 3M FRANCE IN THE FRENCH COURTS IN 2006 CLAIMING COMMERCIAL LOSS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE AFTER EXPERIENCING ELECTRICAL NETWORK FAILURES WHICH EDF CLAIMS WERE CAUSED BY ALLEGEDLY DEFECTIVE 3M TRANSITION SPLICES. THE FRENCH COURT OF APPEALS AT VERSAILLES AFFIRMED THE COMMERCIAL TRIAL COURT’S DECISION THAT THE TRANSITION SPLICES CONFORMED TO CONTRACT SPECIFICATIONS AND THAT EDF THOROUGHLY ANALYZED AND TESTED THE SPLICES BEFORE PURCHASE AND INSTALLATION. THE COURT OF APPEALS, HOWEVER, ORDERED A COURT-APPOINTED EXPERT TO STUDY THE PROBLEM AND ISSUE A TECHNICAL OPINION ON THE CAUSE OF THE NETWORK FAILURES. THE COURT-APPOINTED EXPERT SUBMITTED HIS REPORT TO THE COMMERCIAL COURT IN MAY 2014. THE EXPERT FOUND POTENTIAL DEFECTS IN 3M’S PRODUCT AND FOUND THAT EDF INCURRED DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF

100

MILLION EUROS. THE EXPERT’S OPINION IS NOT DISPOSITIVE OF LIABILITY OR DAMAGES AND IS SUBJECT TO NUMEROUS FACTUAL AND LEGAL CHALLENGES THAT WILL BE RAISED WITH THE COURT. THE PARTIES ARE BRIEFING THE COURT ON THEIR RESPECTIVE POSITIONS. ONCE THE BRIEFING IS COMPLETE, THE COMMERCIAL COURT MAY TAKE FROM

SIX

MONTHS TO

ONE

YEAR TO RENDER ITS DECISION.

ONE

CUSTOMER OBTAINED AN ORDER IN THE FRENCH COURTS AGAINST 3M PURIFICATION SAS (A FRENCH SUBSIDIARY) IN OCTOBER 2011 APPOINTING AN EXPERT TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF COMMERCIAL LOSS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY ALLEGEDLY DEFECTIVE 3M FILTERS USED IN THE CUSTOMER’S MANUFACTURING PROCESS. AN AUSTRIAN SUBSIDIARY OF THIS SAME CUSTOMER ALSO FILED A CLAIM AGAINST 3M AUSTRIA GMBH (AN AUSTRIAN SUBSIDIARY) AND 3M PURIFICATION SAS IN THE AUSTRIAN COURTS IN SEPTEMBER 2012 SEEKING DAMAGES FOR THE SAME ISSUE.

THOSE

TWO

CASES ARE STILL PENDING. ANOTHER

CUSTOMER FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST 3M DEUTSCHLAND GMBH (A GERMAN SUBSIDIARY) IN THE GERMAN COURTS IN MARCH 2012 SEEKING COMMERCIAL LOSS AND PROPERTY DAMAGE ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY THE SAME 3M FILTERS USED IN THAT CUSTOMER’S MANUFACTURING PROCESS; THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED THE CLAIMS IN THE GERMAN LITIGATION. THE COMPANY HAS ALSO SETTLED WITHOUT LITIGATION THE CLAIMS OF

TWO

OTHER CUSTOMERS ARISING OUT OF THE SAME ISSUE. THE AMOUNTS PAID ARE NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE COMPANY IS A NAMED DEFENDANT IN

122

LAWSUITS, MOST OF WHICH ARE PENDING IN FEDERAL OR STATE COURT IN MINNESOTA, IN WHICH THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIM THEY UNDERWENT VARIOUS JOINT ARTHROPLASTY

,

CARDIOVASCULAR

, AND OTHER SURGERIES

AND LATER DEVELOPED SURGICAL SITE INFECTIONS DUE TO THE USE OF THE BAIR HUGGERTM PATIENT WARMING SYSTEM.  THE U.S. JUDICIAL PANEL ON MULTIDISTRICT LITIGATION GRANTED THE PLAINTIFFS’ MOTION TO TRANSFER AND CONSOLIDATE ALL CASES PENDING IN FEDERAL COURTS TO THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA TO BE MANAGED IN A MULTI-DISTRICT PROCEEDING DURING THE PRE-TRIAL PHASE OF THE LITIGATION.

THE BAIR HUGGERTM PRODUCT LINE WAS ACQUIRED BY 3M AS PART OF THE 2010 ACQUISITION OF ARIZANT, INC., A LEADING

MANUFACTURER OF PATIENT WARMING SOLUTIONS DESIGNED TO PREVENT HYPOTHERMIA AND MAINTAIN NORMAL BODY TEMPERATURE IN SURGICAL SETTINGS.

NO

LIABILITY HAS BEEN RECORDED FOR THIS MATTER BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ANY SUCH LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE AT THIS TIME.

FOR PRODUCT LIABILITY LITIGATION MATTERS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION FOR WHICH A LIABILITY HAS BEEN RECORDED, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THE AMOUNT RECORDED IS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE A POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF THE ESTABLISHED ACCRUALS AT THIS TIME.

NOTE 15. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

THE 3M 2008 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN PROVIDES FOR THE ISSUANCE OR DELIVERY OF UP TO

100

MILLION SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK (INCLUDING ADDITIONAL SHAREHOLDER APPROVALS SUBSEQUENT TO 2008) PURSUANT TO AWARDS GRANTED UNDER THE PLAN. AWARDS UNDER THIS PLAN MAY BE ISSUED IN THE FORM OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, PROGRESSIVE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OTHER STOCK AWARDS, AND PERFORMANCE UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES. AWARDS DENOMINATED IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OTHER THAN OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, PER THE 2008 PLAN, COUNT AGAINST THE 100 MILLION SHARE LIMIT AS

3.38

SHARES FOR EVERY ONE SHARE COVERED BY SUCH AWARD (FOR FULL VALUE AWARDS WITH GRANT DATES PRIOR TO MAY 11, 2010), AS

2.87

SHARES FOR EVERY ONE SHARE COVERED BY SUCH AWARD (FOR FULL VALUE AWARDS WITH GRANT DATES ON OR AFTER MAY 11, 2010, AND PRIOR TO MAY 8, 2012), OR AS

3.50

SHARES FOR EVERY ONE SHARE COVERED BY SUCH AWARD (FOR FULL VALUE AWARDS WITH GRANT DATES OF MAY 8, 2012 OR LATER). THE REMAINING TOTAL SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE 2008 LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN PROGRAM ARE

20,328,681

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015. THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY

9,20

0

PARTICIPANTS WITH OUTSTANDING OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, OR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2015.

THE COMPANY’S ANNUAL STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT IS MADE IN FEBRUARY TO PROVIDE A STRONG AND IMMEDIATE LINK BETWEEN THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUALS DURING THE PRECEDING YEAR AND THE SIZE OF THEIR ANNUAL STOCK COMPENSATION GRANTS. THE GRANT TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES USES THE CLOSING STOCK PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE. ACCOUNTING RULES REQUIRE RECOGNITION OF EXPENSE UNDER A NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING PERIOD APPROACH, REQUIRING COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNITION WHEN AN EMPLOYEE IS ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE. EMPLOYEES ARE CONSIDERED ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE AT AGE

55

AND AFTER HAVING COMPLETED

FIVE

YEARS OF SERVICE. THIS RETIREE-ELIGIBLE POPULATION REPRESENTS

35

PERCENT OF THE 2015 ANNUAL STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARD EXPENSE DOLLARS; THEREFORE, HIGHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN THE FIRST QUARTER. 3M ALSO HAS GRANTED PROGRESSIVE (RELOAD) OPTIONS. THESE OPTIONS ARE NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS THAT WERE GRANTED TO CERTAIN PARTICIPANTS UNDER THE 1997 OR 2002 MANAGEMENT STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM, BUT FOR WHICH THE RELOAD FEATURE WAS ELIMINATED IN 2005 (ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS ONLY).

IN ADDITION TO THE ANNUAL GRANTS, THE COMPANY MAKES OTHER MINOR GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED GRANTS. THE COMPANY ISSUES CASH SETTLED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES. THESE GRANTS DO NOT RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK AND ARE CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL BY THE COMPANY.

AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, WHICH INCLUDE STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE SHARES, AND THE GENERAL EMPLOYEES’ STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (GESPP), ARE PROVIDED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE. CAPITALIZED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AMOUNTS WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS ENDED 2015, 2014 AND 2013.

MILLION OF COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAT HAS YET TO BE RECOGNIZED RELATED TO NON-VESTED STOCK OPTION BASED AWARDS. THIS EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING WEIGHTED-AVERAGE VESTING PERIOD OF

21

MONTHS. FOR OPTIONS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2015, THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL LIFE WAS

$226

MILLION AND

$208

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC POLICY TO REPURCHASE COMMON SHARES TO MITIGATE THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF OPTIONS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY MADE ADEQUATE DISCRETIONARY PURCHASES, BASED ON CASH AVAILABILITY, MARKET TRENDS, AND OTHER FACTORS, TO SATISFY STOCK OPTION EXERCISE ACTIVITY.

FOR ANNUAL AND PROGRESSIVE (RELOAD) OPTIONS, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE AT THE DATE OF GRANT WAS CALCULATED USING THE BLACK-SCHOLES OPTION-PRICING MODEL AND THE ASSUMPTIONS THAT FOLLOW.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS GRANTED UNDER THE 3M 2008 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN GENERALLY VEST

THREE

YEARS FOLLOWING THE GRANT DATE ASSUMING CONTINUED EMPLOYMENT. DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS EQUAL TO THE DIVIDENDS PAYABLE ON THE SAME NUMBER OF SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK ACCRUE ON THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS DURING THE VESTING PERIOD, ALTHOUGH

NO

DIVIDEND EQUIVALENTS ARE PAID ON ANY OF THESE RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS THAT ARE FORFEITED PRIOR TO THE VESTING DATE. DIVIDENDS ARE PAID OUT IN CASH AT THE VEST DATE ON RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, EXCEPT FOR PERFORMANCE SHARES WHICH DO NOT EARN DIVIDENDS. SINCE THE RIGHTS TO DIVIDENDS ARE FORFEITABLE, THERE IS

NO

IMPACT ON BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS. WEIGHTED AVERAGE RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT SHARES OUTSTANDING ARE INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.

PERFORMANCE SHARES

INSTEAD OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, THE COMPANY MAKES ANNUAL GRANTS OF PERFORMANCE SHARES TO MEMBERS OF ITS EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT. THE 2015 PERFORMANCE CRITERIA FOR THESE PERFORMANCE SHARES (ORGANIC VOLUME GROWTH, RETURN ON INVESTED CAPITAL, FREE CASH FLOW CONVERSION, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH) WERE SELECTED BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THEY ARE IMPORTANT DRIVERS OF LONG-TERM STOCKHOLDER VALUE.

THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK THAT COULD ACTUALLY BE DELIVERED AT THE END OF THE

THREE

-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD MAY BE ANYWHERE FROM

0%

TO

200%

OF EACH PERFORMANCE SHARE GRANTED, DEPENDING ON THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMPANY DURING SUCH PERFORMANCE PERIOD. NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING REQUIRES THAT EXPENSE FOR THE PERFORMANCE SHARES BE RECOGNIZED OVER

ONE

OR

THREE

YEARS DEPENDING ON WHEN EACH INDIVIDUAL BECAME A 3M EXECUTIVE. PERFORMANCE SHARES DO NOT ACCRUE DIVIDENDS DURING THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. THEREFORE, THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED BY REDUCING THE CLOSING STOCK PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT BY THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF DIVIDENDS DURING THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD.

. BUSINESS SEGMENTS

3M’S BUSINESSES ARE ORGANIZED, MANAGED AND INTERNALLY GROUPED INTO SEGMENTS BASED ON DIFFERENCES IN MARKETS, PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES. 3M MANAGES ITS OPERATIONS IN

FIVE

BUSINESS SEGMENTS: INDUSTRIAL; SAFETY AND GRAPHICS; HEALTH CARE;

ELECTRONICS AND ENERGY;

AND CONSUMER. 3M’S FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS BRING TOGETHER COMMON OR RELATED 3M TECHNOLOGIES, ENHANCING THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND PROVIDING FOR EFFICIENT SHARING OF BUSINESS RESOURCES. TRANSACTIONS AMONG REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE RECORDED AT COST. 3M IS AN INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE CHARACTERIZED BY SUBSTANTIAL INTERSEGMENT COOPERATION, COST ALLOCATIONS AND INVENTORY TRANSFERS. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT REPRESENT THAT THESE SEGMENTS, IF OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY, WOULD REPORT THE OPERATING INCOME INFORMATION SHOWN. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OPERATING INCOME AND PRE-TAX INCOME RELATES TO INTEREST INCOME AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WHICH ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES A VARIETY OF MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS, SUCH AS CORPORATE INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, CERTAIN DERIVATIVE GAINS AND LOSSES, CERTAIN INSURANCE-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES, CERTAIN LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSES, CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND CERTAIN UNDER- OR OVER-ABSORBED COSTS (E.G. PENSION, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION) THAT THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE NOT TO ALLOCATE DIRECTLY TO ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. BECAUSE THIS CATEGORY INCLUDES A VARIETY OF MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS, IT IS SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION ON A QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL BASIS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

3M BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING MEASURES INCLUDE DUAL CREDIT TO BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR CERTAIN U.S. SALES AND RELATED OPERATING INCOME. MANAGEMENT EVALUATES EACH OF ITS FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS BASED ON NET SALES AND OPERATING INCOME PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING DUAL CREDIT U.S. REPORTING TO FURTHER INCENTIVIZE U.S. SALES GROWTH. AS A RESULT, 3M PROVIDES ADDITIONAL (“DUAL”) CREDIT TO THOSE BUSINESS SEGMENTS SELLING PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. TO AN EXTERNAL CUSTOMER WHEN THAT SEGMENT IS NOT THE PRIMARY SELLER OF THE PRODUCT. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN RESPIRATORS ARE PRIMARILY SOLD BY THE PERSONAL SAFETY DIVISION WITHIN THE SAFETY AND GRAPHICS BUSINESS SEGMENT; HOWEVER, THE INDUSTRIAL BUSINESS SEGMENT ALSO SELLS THIS PRODUCT TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN ITS U.S. MARKETS. IN THIS EXAMPLE, THE NON-PRIMARY SELLING SEGMENT (INDUSTRIAL) WOULD ALSO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR THE ASSOCIATED NET SALES IT INITIATED AND THE RELATED APPROXIMATE OPERATING INCOME. THE ASSIGNED OPERATING INCOME RELATED TO DUAL CREDIT ACTIVITY MAY DIFFER FROM OPERATING INCOME THAT WOULD RESULT FROM ACTUAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH SALES. THE OFFSET TO THE DUAL CREDIT BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING IS REFLECTED AS A RECONCILING ITEM ENTITLED “ELIMINATION OF DUAL CREDIT,” SUCH THAT SALES AND OPERATING INCOME FOR THE U.S. IN TOTAL ARE UNCHANGED.

NOTE 17.

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

GEOGRAPHIC AREA INFORMATION IS USED BY THE COMPANY AS A SECONDARY PERFORMANCE MEASURE TO MANAGE ITS BUSINESSES. EXPORT SALES AND CERTAIN INCOME AND EXPENSE ITEMS ARE GENERALLY REPORTED WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WHERE THE FINAL SALES TO 3M CUSTOMERS ARE MADE.

CONTROLS

AND PROCEDURES.

A. THE COMPANY CARRIED OUT AN EVALUATION, UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF ITS MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE DESIGN AND OPERATION OF THE COMPANY’S “DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES” (AS DEFINED IN THE EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(E)) AS OF THE END OF THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT. BASED UPON THAT EVALUATION, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANY’S DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE EFFECTIVE.

B. THE COMPANY’S MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, AS DEFINED IN THE EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(F). MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN

INTERNAL CONTROL — INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013).

BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015

, THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE.

MANAGEMENT’S ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 EXCLUDED CAPITAL SAFETY GROUP S.A.R.L. AND POLYPORE INTERNATIONAL, INC.’S SEPARATION MEDIA BUSINESS, WHICH WERE BOTH ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY IN AUGUST 2015 IN PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.

THESE ACQUIRED BUSINESS

ES

’ TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL NET SALES, IN THE AGGREGATE, REPRESENTED LESS THAN 2 PERCENT AND LESS THAN 1 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY’S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AMOUNTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2015.

COMPANIES ARE ALLOWED TO EXCLUDE ACQUISITIONS FROM THEIR ASSESSMENT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF ACQUISITION WHILE INTEGRATING THE ACQUIRED COMPANY UNDER GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2015 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS

LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN, WHICH EXPRESSES AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2015.

C. THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING THAT OCCURRED DURING THE COMPANY’S MOST RECENTLY COMPLETED FISCAL QUARTER THAT HAS MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR IS REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, THE COMPANY’S INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

THE COMPANY IS IMPLEMENTING AN ENTERPRISE RESOURCE PLANNING (“ERP”) SYSTEM ON A WORLDWIDE BASIS, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY OF CERTAIN FINANCIAL AND RELATED TRANSACTION PROCESSES. THE GRADUAL IMPLEMENTATION IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN PHASES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. THE IMPLEMENTATION OF A WORLDWIDE ERP SYSTEM WILL LIKELY AFFECT THE PROCESSES THAT CONSTITUTE OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND WILL REQUIRE TESTING FOR EFFECTIVENESS.

THE COMPANY COMPLETED IMPLEMENTATION WITH RESPECT TO ELEMENTS OF CERTAIN PROCESSES/SUB-PROCESSES IN LIMITED SUBSIDIARIES/LOCATIONS AND WILL CONTINUE TO ROLL-OUT THE ERP SYSTEM OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. AS WITH ANY NEW INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY APPLICATION WE IMPLEMENT, THIS APPLICATION, ALONG WITH THE INTERNAL CONTROLS OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED IN THIS PROCESS, WAS APPROPRIATELY CONSIDERED WITHIN THE TESTING FOR EFFECTIVENESS WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPLEMENTATION IN THESE INSTANCES. WE CONCLUDED, AS PART OF OUR EVALUATION DESCRIBED IN THE ABOVE PARAGRAPHS, THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF ERP IN THESE CIRCUMSTANCES HAS NOT MATERIALLY AFFECTED OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.
