RESEARCH AND PATENTS

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT CONSTITUTE AN IMPORTANT PART OF 3MS ACTIVITIES. PRODUCTS RESULTING

FROM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAVE BEEN A MAJOR DRIVER OF 3MS GROWTH.

$1.194 BILLION IN 2004 AND $1.147 BILLION IN 2003. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND IMPROVED PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, TOTALED $798

MILLION IN 2005, $759 MILLION IN 2004 AND $749 MILLION IN 2003.  RELATED EXPENSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TECHNICAL

SUPPORT PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS BY 3M LABORATORIES AND COSTS

OF INTERNALLY DEVELOPED PATENTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AROUND THE WORLD

UNDER VARIOUS TRADEMARKS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ALSO

OWNS, OR HOLDS LICENSES TO USE, NUMEROUS U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS. THE COMPANYS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES CONTINUOUSLY GENERATE INVENTIONS THAT ARE

COVERED BY NEW PATENTS. PATENTS APPLICABLE TO SPECIFIC PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR

VARYING PERIODS ACCORDING TO THE DATE OF PATENT APPLICATION FILING OR PATENT

GRANT AND THE

5

LEGAL TERM OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES

WHERE PATENT PROTECTION IS OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY A

PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF

PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN THE

COUNTRY.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS PATENTS PROVIDE AN

IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN MANY OF ITS BUSINESSES. IN GENERAL, NO

SINGLE PATENT OR GROUP OF RELATED PATENTS IS IN ITSELF ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY

AS A WHOLE OR TO ANY OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE IMPORTANCE OF

PATENTS IN THE HEALTH CARE AND DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENTS IS DESCRIBED IN PERFORMANCE

BY BUSINESS SEGMENT  HEALTH CARE BUSINESS AND DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS

BUSINESS IN PART II, ITEM 7, OF THIS FORM 10-K.

RAW MATERIALS

IN 2005, T

HE

COMPANY EXPERIENCED BOTH PRICE INCREASES AND SUPPLY LIMITATIONS AFFECTING

SEVERAL OIL-DERIVED RAW MATERIALS, BUT TO DATE THE COMPANY IS RECEIVING

SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF SUCH MATERIALS TO MEET ITS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE

PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS.

IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO

PREDICT FUTURE SHORTAGES OF RAW MATERIALS OR THE IMPACT ANY SUCH SHORTAGES

WOULD HAVE.

HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA RESULTED IN TIGHT SUPPLY CONDITIONS AND

SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS, FUEL SURCHARGES AND PRICES FOR CERTAIN

NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM RELATED RAW MATERIALS. 3M HAS AVOIDED DISRUPTION TO

ITS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS THROUGH CAREFUL MANAGEMENT OF EXISTING RAW

MATERIAL INVENTORIES AND DEVELOPMENT AND QUALIFICATION OF ADDITIONAL SUPPLY

SOURCES. 3M MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS,

PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL

LAW COMPLIANCE

3MS MANUFACTURING

OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AROUND

THE WORLD. 3M HAS MADE, AND PLANS TO CONTINUE MAKING, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES

FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS. 3M IS ALSO INVOLVED IN REMEDIATION ACTIONS

RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS FROM PAST OPERATIONS AT CERTAIN SITES (REFER

TO ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES IN NOTE 11 COMMITMENTS

AND CONTINGENCIES).

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES

RELATING TO EXISTING CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT

CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE REVENUES ARE EXPENSED. LIABILITIES FOR

REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE

AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY

STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION. ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE

OPERATIONS GENERALLY ARE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES.

IN 2005, 3M EXPENDED ABOUT

$26 MILLION FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS RELATED TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. THE

COMPARABLE AMOUNT IN 2004 WAS ABOUT $67 MILLION. THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE

EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIONS RELATING TO EXISTING MATTERS CAUSED BY

PAST OPERATIONS. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES HAVE INCLUDED

POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICES  SUCH AS WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT IMPROVEMENTS,

SCRUBBERS, CONTAINMENT STRUCTURES, SOLVENT RECOVERY UNITS AND THERMAL OXIDIZERS

 AT NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES CONSTRUCTED OR UPGRADED IN THE NORMAL COURSE

OF BUSINESS. CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS POLICIES STRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (OTHER THAN FOR REMEDIATION PROJECTS) FOR

KNOWN PROJECTS ARE PRESENTLY EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $35 MILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO

YEARS FOR NEW OR EXPANDED PROGRAMS TO BUILD FACILITIES OR MODIFY MANUFACTURING

PROCESSES TO MINIMIZE WASTE AND REDUCE EMISSIONS.

WHILE THE COMPANY CANNOT

PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE FUTURE COSTS OF SUCH CLEANUP ACTIVITIES, CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

ITEM 1A.

RISK

FACTORS.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY ARE AS

FOLLOWS.



RESULTS ARE IMPACTED BY THE EFFECTS OF, AND CHANGES IN, WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS

. THE COMPANY OPERATES IN MORE THAN 60 COUNTRIES AND

DERIVES APPROXIMATELY 60% OF ITS REVENUES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER

COUNTRIES THAT ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL, SUCH AS DOWNTURNS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION, OR IN THE VARIOUS INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE

COMPANY OPERATES; SOCIAL, POLITICAL OR LABOR CONDITIONS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY

OR REGION; OR POTENTIAL ADVERSE CHANGES IN TAX IN THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH

THE COMPANY OPERATES.



THE

COMPANYS RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMER

PREFERENCES

.  DEMAND FOR

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, WHICH IMPACTS REVENUE AND PROFIT MARGINS, IS AFFECTED

BY (I) THE DEVELOPMENT AND TIMING OF INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS; (II)

THE COMPANYS RESPONSE TO DOWNWARD PRICING TO STAY COMPETITIVE; (III) CHANGES

IN CUSTOMER ORDER PATTERNS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF INVENTORY

MAINTAINED BY CUSTOMERS AND THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER PURCHASES WHICH MAY BE

AFFECTED BY ANNOUNCED PRICE CHANGES, CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS INCENTIVE

PROGRAMS, OR THE CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE INCENTIVE GOALS ; AND (IV)

CHANGES IN CUSTOMERS PREFERENCES FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING CHANGES IN

CUSTOMER DESIGNS FOR THEIR PRODUCTS THAT CAN AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR SOME OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS.



FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THOSE RATES MAY AFFECT THE

COMPANYS ABILITY TO REALIZE PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN ITS SALES AND EARNINGS.

BECAUSE THE

COMPANY DERIVES APPROXIMATELY 60% OF ITS REVENUES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES, ITS ABILITY TO REALIZE PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN SALES AND EARNINGS

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS SIGNIFICANTLY

AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES.



THE

COMPANYS GROWTH OBJECTIVES ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TIMING AND MARKET

ACCEPTANCE OF ITS NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING

ITS ABILITY TO RENEW ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND

TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

THIS ABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, SUCH AS THE

INABILITY TO: IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW PRODUCTS; OBTAIN ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY PROTECTION; GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS; OR SUCCESSFULLY

COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS AND OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS. FOR EXAMPLE, NEW 3M

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS, LIKE ANY PHARMACEUTICAL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, FACE

SUBSTANTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT AND

REGULATORY REVIEW. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT NEW PRODUCTS WILL PROVE TO BE

COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL.



THE

COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COSTS AND

AVAILABILITY OF PURCHASED COMPONENTS, COMPOUNDS, RAW MATERIALS

AND ENERGY,

INCLUDING OIL

AND NATURAL GAS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES,

DUE TO

SHORTAGES, INCREASED DEMAND, SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS,

NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER FACTORS

. THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON VARIOUS

COMPONENTS, COMPOUNDS, RAW MATERIALS, AND ENERGY (INCLUDING OIL AND NATURAL GAS

AND THEIR DERIVATIVES) SUPPLIED BY OTHERS FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF ITS PRODUCTS

AND IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ANY OF ITS SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS COULD BE INTERRUPTED

DUE TO NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS AND OTHER EVENTS OR TERMINATED IN THE

FUTURE. ANY SUSTAINED INTERRUPTION IN THE COMPANYS RECEIPT OF ADEQUATE

SUPPLIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION,

WHILE THE COMPANY HAS A PROCESS TO MINIMIZE VOLATILITY IN COMPONENT AND

MATERIAL PRICING, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS OR THAT FUTURE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS OR

SHORTAGES WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.



ACQUISITIONS,

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER UNUSUAL EVENTS RESULTING FROM

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AND OTHER EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, AND

POSSIBLE ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

. THE COMPANY

MONITORS ITS BUSINESS PORTFOLIO AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND HAS MADE AND

MAY CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, DIVESTITURES AND

CHANGES TO ITS ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE. WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, FUTURE

RESULTS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO QUICKLY INTEGRATE AN

ACQUIRED BUSINESS AND OBTAIN THE ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES.



THE COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF THE

COMPANY GENERATES LESS PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS THAN ESTIMATED

. THE

COMPANY UTILIZES VARIOUS TOOLS, SUCH AS SIX SIGMA, TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL

EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ALL OF THE

ESTIMATED PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE REALIZED.



THE COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY

VARIOUS LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING PRODUCT

LIABILITY, ANTITRUST, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHER MATTERS.

THE OUTCOME OF

THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY DIFFER FROM THE COMPANYS EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE THE

OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION, INCLUDING REGULATORY MATTERS, ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO

RELIABLY PREDICT. VARIOUS FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN LEAD THE COMPANY TO

CHANGE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES AND RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES WHERE

APPLICABLE, OR MAKE SUCH ESTIMATES FOR MATTERS PREVIOUSLY NOT

9

SUSCEPTIBLE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES, SUCH AS A SIGNIFICANT JUDICIAL

RULING OR JUDGMENT, SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT, SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENT

OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A FUTURE ADVERSE RULING, SETTLEMENT OR

UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN

ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD. A SPECIFIC FACTOR THAT COULD INCREASE THE COMPANYS

ESTIMATE OF ITS FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITIES IS THE PENDING CONGRESSIONAL

CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION TO REFORM ASBESTOS-RELATED LITIGATION AND

PERTINENT INFORMATION DERIVED FROM THAT PROCESS. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION

OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE COMPANY AND ASSOCIATED ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THIS

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

3M IS A DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL MANUFACTURER, TECHNOLOGY

INNOVATOR AND MARKETER OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS. IN 2005, 3M MANAGED ITS

OPERATIONS IN SEVEN OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS: HEALTH CARE; INDUSTRIAL;

DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS; CONSUMER AND OFFICE; ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS; SAFETY,

SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; AND TRANSPORTATION. REFER TO THE PERFORMANCE

BY BUSINESS SEGMENT SECTION FOR DISCUSSION OF SEGMENT CHANGES EFFECTIVE IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2006.

3MS 2005 PERFORMANCE DEMONSTRATED THE OPERATIONAL

STRENGTH OF 3M AND THE VALUE OF THE DIVERSIFICATION OF THE 3M BUSINESS

PORTFOLIO. 3MS SOURCING ORGANIZATION AND THE BUSINESSES WORKED TOGETHER TO

MAINTAIN CUSTOMER SERVICE, WHILE SUCCESSFULLY MANAGING THE BUSINESS TO AVOID

SUPPLY DISRUPTIONS IN THE FACE OF HURRICANES AND SHORTAGES OF KEY RAW

MATERIALS. 3M INCREASED ITS DIVIDEND 16.7%, THE 47

TH

CONSECUTIVE

YEAR OF 3M DIVIDEND INCREASES, AND REPURCHASED $2.3 BILLION OF STOCK UNDER ITS

STOCK REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION. THE COMBINATION OF DIVIDENDS AND STOCK

BUY-BACKS RETURNED A TOTAL OF $3.6 BILLION TO SHAREHOLDERS DURING 2005. 3M ALSO

ACQUIRED CUNO, A LIQUID FILTRATION COMPANY.

IN

2005,

3M REPORTED RECORD NET SALES OF

$21.167 BILLION AND RECORD NET INCOME OF $3.199 BILLION, OR $4.12 PER DILUTED

SHARE, COMPARED WITH NET SALES OF $20.011 BILLION AND NET INCOME OF $2.990

BILLION, OR $3.75 PER DILUTED SHARE, IN 2004. THE COMBINATION OF A 5.8%

INCREASE IN NET SALES, INCLUDING CORE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH OF 4.1%

(WHICH EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS)

, AND DECLINING MANUFACTURING COSTS AS A PERCENT

OF SALES, RESULTED IN A 23.7% OPERATING INCOME PROFIT MARGIN.

IN

2005, INCOME BEFORE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE TOTALED $3.234

BILLION, OR $4.16 PER DILUTED SHARE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005,

3M ADOPTED

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD INTERPRETATION (FASB) NO. 47, ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FIN 47). THE ADOPTION OF FIN 47 RESULTED IN AN AFTER

TAX CHARGE OF $35 MILLION, WHICH IS REFLECTED AS A CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE (REFER TO NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

FOR MORE DETAIL). IN ADDITION, D

URING 2005,

3M COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THE REPATRIATION PROVISION OF THE AMERICAN JOBS

CREATION ACT OF 2004 AND REPATRIATED APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION OF FOREIGN

EARNINGS INTO THE U.S. PURSUANT TO ITS PROVISIONS. AS A CONSEQUENCE, IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2005, 3M RECORDED A TAX EXPENSE OF $75 MILLION, NET OF

AVAILABLE FOREIGN TAX CREDITS. COMBINED, THESE TWO ITEMS REDUCED NET INCOME BY

$110 MILLION IN 2005.

3MS PERFORMANCE IN 2005 WAS BROAD-BASED, WITH ALL SEVEN

BUSINESS SEGMENTS CONTRIBUTING TO POSITIVE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH.

SALES GROWTH IN HEALTH CARE WAS LED BY 3MS CORE MEDICAL AND DENTAL

BUSINESSES AND STRONG GROWTH IN HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS, WHICH HELPED

OVERCOME THE GROWTH CHALLENGES OF THE PHARMACEUTICALS AND PERSONAL CARE

BUSINESSES.

SALES GROWTH IN

THE INDUSTRIAL

SEGMENT WAS

LED BY INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES AND TAPES, AS WELL AS THE ABRASIVES

BUSINESSES. THE CUNO ACQUISITION ADDED 5.1% TO INDUSTRIAL SALES GROWTH.

DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SALES

GROWTH IN

DISPLAY ENHANCEMENT FILMS USED IN

FLAT-PANEL DEVICES WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE CONTINUED DECLINE IN LENS

SYSTEMS FOR

13

THE CRT REAR PROJECTION TELEVISION MARKET ALONG WITH THE

PHASE OUT OF THE COMMERCIAL VIDEOTAPE BUSINESS. SALES GROWTH IN THE CONSUMER

AND OFFICE SEGMENT WAS BROAD-BASED ACROSS THE MANY CHANNELS 3M SERVES, MOST

NOTABLY IN THE MASS-MARKET CONSUMER AND HOME IMPROVEMENT RETAIL CHANNELS. FOR THE

ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT, SALES GROWTH WAS LED BY DEMAND FOR

3M ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS FOR THE SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURERS, ALONG WITH

CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH IN ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS FOR INSULATING, TESTING AND

SENSING.

SALES GROWTH IN THE SAFETY, SECURITY

AND PROTECTION SERVICES SEGMENT WAS DRIVEN BY CONTINUED STRONG DEMAND FOR

PERSONAL PROTECTION PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS, PARTICULARLY RESPIRATORY PROTECTION

PRODUCTS, ALONG WITH STRONG DEMAND FOR CLEANING AND PROTECTION PRODUCTS FOR

COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS. SALES GROWTH IN THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT WAS LED BY

BOTH THE AUTOMOTIVE OEM AND REPAIR MARKETS.

REFER TO THE PERFORMANCE BY

BUSINESS SEGMENT SECTION FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS OF THE

RESPECTIVE SEGMENTS.

GEOGRAPHICALLY,

U.S. SALES REVENUE INCREASED 4.9%, ASIA PACIFIC LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES (WHICH

EXCLUDE TRANSLATION IMPACTS) INCREASED 10.6%,

EUROPEAN

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 0.9%, AND THE COMBINED LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA

AREA LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 1.3%.

REFER TO THE PERFORMANCE BY

GEOGRAPHIC AREA SECTION FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS FOR THE

RESPECTIVE AREAS.

OPERATING

INCOME IN 2005 INCREASED BY 9.4% VERSUS 2004, AS ALL SEVEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS

POSTED INCREASES. THE COMBINATION OF SOLID SALES GROWTH AND POSITIVE BENEFITS

FROM CORPORATE INITIATIVES HELPED DRIVE THE INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME. THE

COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT COST REDUCTION PROJECTS RELATED TO INITIATIVES PROVIDED

A COMBINED INCREMENTAL BENEFIT TO OPERATING INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION

IN 2005. THESE INITIATIVES CONTRIBUTED MORE THAN $400 MILLION TO OPERATING

INCOME IN BOTH 2004 AND 2003.

3M

GENERATED $4.258 BILLION OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN 2005, ESSENTIALLY FLAT WHEN

COMPARED TO 2004, AND ENDED THE YEAR WITH $1.072 BILLION OF CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS. IN 2005, THE COMPANY UTILIZED APPROXIMATELY $3.6 BILLION OF CASH

TO REPURCHASE 3M COMMON STOCK UNDER ITS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION AND TO

PAY DIVIDENDS, AND CONTRIBUTED $788 MILLION TO ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

PLANS. 3MS DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL CAPITAL DEFINED AS DEBT PLUS

EQUITY) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, WAS APPROXIMATELY 19%. 3M HAS AN AA CREDIT

RATING FROM STANDARD & POORS AND AN AA1 CREDIT RATING FROM MOODYS

INVESTORS SERVICE.

THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED BOTH PRICE INCREASES AND SUPPLY LIMITATIONS

AFFECTING SEVERAL OIL-DERIVED RAW MATERIALS IN 2005, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO CARRY

FORWARD INTO 2006, BUT

TO DATE THE COMPANY

IS RECEIVING SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF SUCH MATERIALS TO MEET ITS REASONABLY

FORESEEABLE PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS.

IT

IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT FUTURE SHORTAGES OF RAW MATERIALS OR THE IMPACT ANY

SUCH SHORTAGES WOULD HAVE.

HURRICANES KATRINA AND RITA RESULTED IN TIGHT

SUPPLY CONDITIONS AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN ENERGY COSTS, FUEL SURCHARGES

AND PRICES FOR CERTAIN NATURAL GAS AND PETROLEUM-RELATED RAW MATERIALS AND

THEIR DERIVATIVES. 3M HAS AVOIDED DISRUPTION TO ITS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS

THROUGH CAREFUL MANAGEMENT OF EXISTING RAW MATERIAL INVENTORIES AND DEVELOPMENT

AND QUALIFICATION OF ADDITIONAL SUPPLY SOURCES. 3M MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE

RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND

FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS. FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

ALSO IMPACT RESULTS, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY MINIMIZES THIS EFFECT THROUGH HEDGING

ABOUT HALF OF THIS IMPACT. 3M WILL ALSO CONTINUE, AS IT HAS FOR MANY YEARS, TO

INCUR EXPENSES (INSURED AND UNINSURED) IN MANAGING ITS LITIGATION AND

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES.

IN 2006, 3M EXPECTS TO DRIVE PROFITABLE GROWTH BY INVESTING IN ITS MOST

PROMISING COMMERCIALIZATION, GEOGRAPHIC AND TECHNOLOGY OPPORTUNITIES, WITH PART

OF THIS INVESTMENT COMING FROM SAVINGS GENERATED THROUGH CONTINUOUS OPERATIONAL

IMPROVEMENTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS SOLID SALES GROWTH ACROSS THE MAJORITY OF ITS

BUSINESS PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANYS LONG HISTORY AND UNIQUE ABILITY TO MATCH

TECHNOLOGICAL SOLUTIONS WITH THE NEEDS OF ITS CUSTOMERS HAS RESULTED IN A

STEADY FLOW OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS, WITH THIS TREND EXPECTED TO CONTINUE

IN 2006. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANYS INCREASING FOCUS ON PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS

FOR EMERGING ECONOMIES, SUCH AS ASIA AND EASTERN EUROPE, IS EXPECTED TO FOSTER

SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN 2006. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO INCREASE BOTH RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN 2006, LED PRIMARILY BY GROWTH PROGRAMS.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES TOTALED $1.242 BILLION IN 2005, OR

5.9% OF SALES. THE COMPANY EXPECTS 2006 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO TOTAL

APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $943 MILLION IN 2005,

PROVIDING THE CAPACITY TO MEET EXPECTED

GROWTH.

WHILE 3M ANTICIPATES SOLID SALES GROWTH ACROSS THE MAJORITY OF ITS

BUSINESSES, SALES ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE IN A FEW OF ITS BUSINESSES. IN HEALTH

CARE, 3M EXPECTS CONTINUED SOLID GROWTH IN ITS CORE MEDICAL AND DENTAL BUSINESSES

AS 3M CONTINUES TO INVEST IN FAST GROWTH AREAS SUCH AS THE ALTERNATE CARE

SEGMENT IN MEDICAL, DIGITAL DENTISTRY, AND EMERGING MARKETS. HOWEVER, 3M

EXPECTS DECLINES IN ITS PERSONAL CARE BUSINESS (WHICH WILL BECOME PART OF THE

COMBINED INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT IN 2006) AND IN ITS BRANDED

PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS (HEALTH CARE) TO PERSIST THROUGHOUT 2006. 3M

EXPERIENCED A SALES DECLINE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005 FOR METROGEL-VAGINAL,

A WOMENS HEALTH CARE PRODUCT, DUE TO A COMPETITIVE PRODUCT. 3M NOW EXPECTS

THAT THERE WILL BE A GENERIC

14

SUBSTITUTE APPROVED FOR METROGEL-VAGINAL, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR

APPROXIMATELY 2% OF TOTAL HEALTH CARE SALES, IN MID 2006. HEALTH CARE SALES FOR

3MS ALDARA (IMIQUIMOD)

PHARMACEUTICAL

PRODUCT

FOR THE ACTINIC KERATOSIS (A PRE-CANCEROUS SKIN CONDITION)

INDICATION HAS AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO FALL SHORT OF EXPECTATIONS 3M HAD

AT THE TIME OF FDA APPROVAL AND 3M IS CURRENTLY REASSESSING ALDARAS TOTAL MARKET

POTENTIAL. IN DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS, 3M EXPECTS THE CONTINUED NEGATIVE IMPACT

FROM THE CRT REAR PROJECTION LENS BUSINESS TO CONTINUE INTO THE FIRST HALF OF

2006, WITH SALES IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2006 EXPECTED TO BE COMPARABLE TO THE

SECOND HALF OF 2005. HOWEVER, IN DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS, 3M EXPECTS THIS DECLINE

IN CRT REAR PROJECTION LENS SALES TO BE MORE THAN OFFSET BY STRONG SALES GROWTH

IN

DISPLAY ENHANCEMENT FILMS USED IN

FLAT-PANEL DEVICES, SUCH AS

LCD

TELEVISIONS.

SALES GROWTH WAS BROAD BASED, WITH SELLING PRICES INCREASING 0.6%.  ALONG WITH THE BENEFITS PROVIDED BY 3MS

SOURCING INITIATIVE, 3MS PRICING STRATEGY HAS BEEN KEY TO MAINTAINING MARGINS

IN THE FACE OF SIGNIFICANT RAW MATERIAL PRICE PRESSURE.  3MS PRICING STRATEGY RESULTED IN U.S. PRICE

GROWTH OF 2.5% IN 2005.

INTERNATIONALLY,

SELLING PRICES DECLINED 0.7% IN 2005.

ADJUSTING FOR THE PRICE DECREASES IN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS RELATED

BUSINESSES (LCD FILMS AND FLEX CIRCUITS), INTERNATIONAL PRICING WOULD HAVE

INCREASED 0.3% IN 2005.

ACQUISITIONS INCREASED 2005 SALES BY

1.0%, DRIVEN BY THE 2005 ACQUISITION OF CUNO.

15

IN 2004, CORE VOLUME

GROWTH (WHICH EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN THE LAST 12 MONTHS)

WAS BROAD-BASED, WITH ALL SEVEN BUSINESSES POSTING WORLDWIDE LOCAL-CURRENCY

SALES GROWTH. LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH WAS LED BY DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS;

INDUSTRIAL; CONSUMER AND OFFICE; SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; AND

THE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESSES. HEALTH CARE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 1.7%,

AS RESULTS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY 2003 SALES FROM PHARMACEUTICAL AND DRUG

DELIVERY AGREEMENTS THAT DID NOT REPEAT IN 2004. ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 2.7%, THE FIRST YEAR OF POSITIVE LOCAL-CURRENCY

SALES GROWTH SINCE 2000. ACQUISITIONS INCREASED 2004 SALES BY 0.5%, DRIVEN BY

THE 2004 ACQUISITIONS OF HIGHJUMP SOFTWARE, INC. AND HORNELL HOLDING AB.

INTERNATIONALLY, SELLING PRICES DECLINED 1.1%, WITH MOST OF THE DECLINE

COMING IN CERTAIN BUSINESSES THAT SERVE THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY, WHERE IT IS

IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE COMBINED IMPACT OF VOLUME AND PRICE.

ON A

GEOGRAPHIC BASIS, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH IN 2004 WAS LED BY THE ASIA

PACIFIC AREA.

COST OF SALES.

COST OF SALES DECREASED 0.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN

2005. COST OF SALES AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES BENEFITED FROM THE COMBINATION OF

IMPROVED SELLING PRICES, FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS, FACTORY

EFFICIENCY AND SOURCING, WHICH HELPED OFFSET THE IMPACT OF HIGHER RAW MATERIAL

PRICES.  RAW MATERIAL COSTS INCREASED

APPROXIMATELY 6.0% FOR 2005 WHEN COMPARED TO 2004, WITH THIS IMPACT MITIGATED

THROUGH COMMODITY HEDGING PROGRAMS AND NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS.  COST OF SALES INCLUDES MANUFACTURING,

ENGINEERING AND FREIGHT COSTS.

THE 2004 DECREASE AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS

DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF HIGHER VOLUMES, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS, ONGOING BENEFITS

OF CORPORATE INITIATIVES AND POSITIVE CURRENCY IMPACTS (INCLUDING HEDGING

IMPACTS). WHILE 3M RAW MATERIAL COSTS INCREASED DURING THE YEAR, 3MS GLOBAL

SOURCING INITIATIVE WAS IMPORTANT IN ENABLING 3M TO MINIMIZE RAW MATERIAL COST

INCREASES DURING A PERIOD OF COMMODITY PRICE INFLATION.

RESEARCH,

DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES AS A

PERCENT OF SALES WERE FLAT WHEN COMPARING 2005 TO 2004. HOWEVER, SPENDING IN

DOLLARS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 4%, REFLECTING 3MS CONTINUING COMMITMENT TO

FUND FUTURE GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY.

SELLING,

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A)

EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WERE FLAT WHEN COMPARING 2005 TO 2004. 3M

CONTINUES TO INVEST IN GROWTH PROGRAMS AND BRAND BUILDING THROUGHOUT THE

PORTFOLIO AS A MEANS OF STIMULATING GROWTH.

SG&A IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2005 WAS IMPACTED BY

A PRE-TAX

CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS OF

ONE PENDING LEPAGES FOLLOW-ON CLASS ACTIONS AND OF TWO INDIVIDUAL FOLLOW-ON

ACTIONS, ALL INVOLVING DIRECT PURCHASERS OF TRANSPARENT TAPE. FOR MORE DETAIL,

REFER TO THE DISCUSSION IN NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES

IMPROVED BY 0.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2004 COMPARED TO 2003. THE IMPROVEMENT IN

2004 AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES WAS HELPED BY LEVERAGE RELATED TO 3MS STRONG

GROWTH IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA. SG&A EXPENSES IN U.S. DOLLARS INCREASED IN

2004, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND INCREASED ADVERTISING AND

MERCHANDISING SPENDING TO SUPPORT 3MS STRONG BRAND PORTFOLIO. ON AN ONGOING

BASIS, THE COMPANY IS SHIFTING SG&A DOLLARS TOWARD FASTER-GROWTH BUSINESSES

AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.

OTHER EXPENSE.

IN 2003, 3M RECORDED

PRE-TAX CHARGES OF $93 MILLION ($58 MILLION AFTER-TAX) RELATED TO AN ADVERSE

RULING IN A LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST 3M IN 1997 BY LEPAGES INC. THE PRE-TAX

CHARGE OF $93 MILLION IS CLASSIFIED AS OTHER EXPENSE WITHIN OPERATING INCOME.

OPERATING

INCOME.

3M USES OPERATING INCOME AS ONE OF ITS PRIMARY

BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TOOLS. OPERATING INCOME IN 2005 WAS

23.7% OF SALES, UP FROM 22.9% OF SALES IN 2004 AND 20.4% OF SALES IN 2003.

OPERATING INCOME IN 2005 GREW BY $431 MILLION, OR 9.4 PERCENT, FOLLOWING 2004

OPERATING INCOME GROWTH OF $865 MILLION, OR 23.3 PERCENT. THE LEPAGES INC.

LAWSUIT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING INCOME IN 2003 BY $93 MILLION, OR 0.5% OF

SALES.

THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (JOBS ACT) AND REPATRIATED APPROXIMATELY

$1.8 BILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS INTO THE U.S. PURSUANT TO ITS PROVISIONS. THE

JOBS ACT PROVIDES 3M THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAX EFFECTIVELY REPATRIATE FOREIGN

EARNINGS FOR U.S. QUALIFYING INVESTMENTS SPECIFIED BY 3MS DOMESTIC

REINVESTMENT PLAN.  AS A CONSEQUENCE, IN

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005, 3M RECORDED A TAX EXPENSE OF $75 MILLION, NET OF

AVAILABLE FOREIGN TAX CREDITS,

WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

THE 2005 EFFECTIVE WORLDWIDE TAX RATE BY 1.5%.

A HALF-POINT TAX RATE REDUCTION COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIODS LAST YEAR

IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMBINATION OF THE EFFECTS OF THE MEDICARE

MODERNIZATION ACT AND THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS DEDUCTION, WHICH WAS A PART

OF THE JOBS ACT.

THE TAX RATE OF 33.0% FOR 2004 WAS COMPARABLE TO

THE 2003 RATE OF 32.9%. INCOME TAXES ASSOCIATED WITH REPATRIATING CERTAIN CASH

FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE 2004 AND 2003 INCOME TAX

RATES.

LOWER NET INCOME IN SUMITOMO 3M, WHILE THE INCREASE IN 2004 RELATED PRIMARILY

TO HIGHER NET INCOME IN SUMITOMO 3M.

CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB INTERPRETATION NO.

47, ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FIN 47).

THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD APPLIES TO THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED

ASSETS AND WHERE THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS EXIST FOR CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUE

OF THESE OBLIGATIONS IS RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS.  OVER TIME THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR

THE CHANGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE AND THE INITIAL CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE

DEPRECIATED OVER THE USEFUL LIVES OF THE RELATED ASSETS.  THE ADOPTION OF FIN 47 RESULTED IN THE

RECOGNITION OF AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION LIABILITY OF $59 MILLION AND AN

AFTER TAX CHARGE OF $35 MILLION, WHICH IS REFLECTED AS A CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE PRO FORMA

EFFECT OF APPLYING THIS GUIDANCE IN ALL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED WAS DETERMINED

NOT TO BE MATERIAL.

17

CURRENCY EFFECTS.

3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR CURRENCY EFFECTS,

INCLUDING HEDGING IMPACTS, INCREASED NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $115 MILLION

IN 2005, $181 MILLION IN 2004 AND $73 MILLION IN 2003. THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES

THE EFFECT OF TRANSLATING PROFITS FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS; THE

IMPACT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF GOODS BETWEEN 3M OPERATIONS

IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD; AND TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE

RISKS.  3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR

DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES INCREASED NET INCOME BY

APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION FOR 2005 AND $48 MILLION IN 2004. 3M ESTIMATES THAT

YEAR-ON-YEAR DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES DECREASED NET

INCOME BY $73 MILLION IN 2003.

PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT

EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2006, 3M COMBINED ITS INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. THIS NEW SEGMENT WILL LEVERAGE COMMON MARKETS, SALES CHANNELS AND

CUSTOMERS, TECHNOLOGIES, MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND SELLING PROCESSES. THIS

COMBINATION WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL EFFICIENCIES THAT WILL BE REINVESTED IN

GROWTH. THE RESULTS FOR THE NEW INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT CAN BE

APPROXIMATED BY COMBINING THE EXISTING INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENTS.

IN ADDITION, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, THE PERSONAL CARE DIVISION (2005

ANNUAL SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION) WITHIN THE HEALTH CARE SEGMENT

TRANSFERRED TO THE COMBINED INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT. SEGMENT

INFORMATION FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED WILL BE RECLASSIFIED IN 2006 TO REFLECT

THE COMBINED INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT IN ADDITION TO THE TRANSFER

OF THE PERSONAL CARE DIVISION.

DISCLOSURES

THE HEALTH CARE SEGMENT SERVES MARKETS THAT

INCLUDE MEDICAL, SURGICAL, PHARMACEUTICAL, DENTAL AND ORTHODONTIC, HEALTH

INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND PERSONAL CARE. PRODUCTS PROVIDED TO THESE MARKETS

INCLUDE MEDICAL AND SURGICAL SUPPLIES, SKIN HEALTH AND INFECTION PREVENTION

PRODUCTS, PHARMACEUTICALS, DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS, DENTAL AND ORTHODONTIC

PRODUCTS, HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS, MICROBIOLOGY PRODUCTS, AND CLOSURES FOR

DISPOSABLE DIAPERS.

IN 2005, HEALTH CARE REPORTED LOCAL-CURRENCY

SALES GROWTH OF 2.9%. 3MS CORE MEDICAL AND DENTAL BUSINESSES AND HEALTH

INFORMATION SYSTEMS BUSINESSES EXPERIENCED LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH OF

APPROXIMATELY 6%. THE STRENGTH OF THESE BUSINESSES HELPED OVERCOME THE SALES

GROWTH CHALLENGES OF THE PHARMACEUTICAL AND PERSONAL CARE BUSINESSES. PERSONAL

CARE, WHICH IS 3MS DIAPER TAPE BUSINESS, HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT RAW

MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES IN SOME PRODUCT LINES OVER THE PAST YEAR, AND 3M HAS

ELECTED TO DRIVE PROFITS AT THE EXPENSE OF VOLUME IN THIS BUSINESS, WHICH HAS

THE LOWEST MARGINS IN THE HEALTH CARE SEGMENT.

SALES OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS

WITHIN 3MS PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF PRESCRIPTION DRUGS

IN INHALATION, WOMENS HEALTH, AND CARDIOVASCULAR, ARE DECLINING DUE TO PRICE

PRESSURE IN EUROPE AND DECREASED DEMAND FOR SOME OF THESE OLDER PRODUCTS.

3M CONTINUES TO GENERATE GROWTH IN ITS

ALDARA

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT, WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR

APPROXIMATELY 6% OF TOTAL HEALTH CARE SALES. ALDARA SALES GREW NEARLY 10% IN

2005, AND GROWTH OUTSIDE THE U.S. WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG. HOWEVER, FOURTH

QUARTER 2005 YEAR-OVER-YEAR LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES DECLINED FOR THE FIRST TIME

SINCE THE PRODUCT WAS LAUNCHED IN 1997. HEALTH CARE SALES FOR 3MS ALDARA

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT FOR THE ACTINIC KERATOIS (A PRE-CANCEROUS SKIN

CONDITION) INDICATION HAS AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO FALL SHORT OF

EXPECTATIONS 3M HAD AT THE TIME OF FDA APPROVAL AND 3M IS

18

CURRENTLY REASSESSING ALDARAS TOTAL MARKET

POTENTIAL. HEALTH CARE CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY, WHICH

HELPED DRIVE AN 8.2% INCREASE IN OPERATING INCOME IN 2005.

THE COMPANYS AGREEMENT WITH TAKEDA

PHARMACEUTICAL CO., LTD., ANNOUNCED IN EARLY 2005 AND DESCRIBED FURTHER BELOW,

IS CURRENTLY THE FOCUS OF THE COMPANYS EFFORTS TO DEVELOP ITS IMMUNE RESPONSE

MODIFIER TECHNOLOGY WHILE THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS OTHER DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

3M RECEIVED U.S. FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) APPROVAL FOR

ALDARA (IMIQUIMOD) CREAM, 5%, IN 1996 FOR THE TREATMENT OF EXTERNAL GENITAL

WARTS, IN MARCH 2004 FOR THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TYPES OF ACTINIC KERATOSIS (A

PRE-CANCEROUS SKIN CONDITION), AND IN JULY 2004 FOR THE TREATMENT OF

SUPERFICIAL BASAL CELL CARCINOMA (A COMMON FORM OF NON-MELANOMA SKIN CANCER).

THE PATENT AND RELATED RIGHTS FOR THE IMIQUIMOD MOLECULE ARE IMPORTANT TO THE

HEALTH CARE BUSINESS. THE ORIGINAL PATENT ON THE IMIQUIMOD MOLECULE EXPIRED IN

AUGUST 2004, BUT THE PATENT TERM EXTENSION RUNS THROUGH AUGUST 2009, WITH AN

ANTICIPATED PEDIATRIC EXCLUSIVITY EXTENSION OF A FURTHER SIX MONTHS TO FEBRUARY

2010.

IN

THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2005, 3M AND TAKEDA PHARMACEUTICAL CO. LTD. ENTERED INTO

AN AGREEMENT TO COLLABORATE ON A POTENTIAL BREAKTHROUGH TREATMENT UTILIZING AN

IMMUNE RESPONSE MODIFIER FOR CERVICAL HIGH-RISK HUMAN PAPILLOMA VIRUS (HPV)

INFECTION AND CERVICAL DYSPLASIA, WHICH ARE KNOWN RISK FACTORS FOR CERVICAL

CANCER.  THIS IMMUNE RESPONSE MODIFIER

CURRENTLY IS IN EARLY STAGE CLINICAL TRIALS, AND 3M AND TAKEDA WILL SHARE

FURTHER DEVELOPMENT COSTS. UPON SUCCESSFUL CLINICAL DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY

APPROVALS, THE PARTIES WILL COMMERCIALIZE JOINTLY IN THE UNITED STATES AND

EUROPE. TAKEDA WILL HOLD COMMERCIAL RIGHTS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES IN ASIA, WHILE

3M WILL RETAIN THE RIGHTS IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.

IN

OCTOBER 2003, IVAX CORPORATION AGREED TO ASSUME EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO 3MS

BRANDED HEALTH CARE RESPIRATORY PRODUCTS, TOGETHER WITH RELATED MARKETING AND

SALES PERSONNEL, IN NINE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE AGREEMENT COVERED QVAR

(BECLOMETHASONE DIPROPIONATE HFA) INHALATION AEROSOL, A MAINTENANCE

MEDICATION USED TO PREVENT ASTHMA ATTACKS, AND ALSO COVERED AIROMIR (ALBUTEROL

SULFATE) INHALER, A RESCUE MEDICATION USED TO RELIEVE ACUTE ASTHMA SYMPTOMS.

3M WILL CONTINUE TO MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY THESE PRODUCTS TO IVAX. THE TOTAL

CONSIDERATION DUE UNDER THE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING MINIMUM ANNUAL ROYALTY

PAYMENTS, WAS $77 MILLION, OF WHICH $24 MILLION WAS PAID IN 2005, $24 MILLION

WAS PAID IN 2004 AND $26 MILLION WAS PAID IN 2003. 3M EXPECTS TO RECEIVE

$3 MILLION IN 2006. 3M MAY ALSO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS IN

2010 (UP TO A MAXIMUM OF APPROXIMATELY $7 MILLION IN TOTAL) IF IVAX ACHIEVES

CERTAIN ANNUAL SALES LEVELS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE ROYALTY REVENUE RELATED

TO THE IVAX AGREEMENT RATABLY OVER THE TERM OF THE LICENSING ARRANGEMENT.

IN 2004, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES IN HEALTH CARE INCREASED 1.7%, WITH 2004

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY 2003 PHARMACEUTICAL AND DRUG DELIVERY AGREEMENTS THAT

DID NOT REPEAT. FOURTH QUARTER 2004 LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GREW 5.0%, AS

YEAR-ON-YEAR COMPARISONS BECAME MORE FAVORABLE. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 9.3%

FUTURE PRODUCTS, RANGE FROM LESS THAN A FEW YEARS TO GREATER THAN 15 YEARS.

THESE PATENTS PROVIDE VARYING MEASURES OF EXCLUSIVITY TO 3M FOR A NUMBER OF

SUCH PRODUCTS. 3MS PROPRIETARY MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY AND KNOW-HOW ALSO

PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO 3M INDEPENDENT OF SUCH PATENTS.

IN 2005, DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS LOCAL-CURRENCY

SALES GREW 4.0%, IMPACTED BY MANY FACTORS. THE FIRST HALF OF 2005 WAS TEMPERED

BY TOUGH YEAR-ON-YEAR OPTICAL FILM COMPARISONS, WHILE 3MS TRAFFIC SAFETY

SYSTEMS BUSINESS AWAITED A NEW HIGHWAY FUNDING BILL IN THE U.S. AND THE

SLUGGISH ECONOMIES IN WESTERN EUROPE AND JAPAN HELD BACK GROWTH IN THE

COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS BUSINESS. GROWTH REBOUNDED IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2005 AS A

NEW U.S. HIGHWAY FUNDING BILL WAS PASSED IN JULY, THE ECONOMIES IN WESTERN

EUROPE AND JAPAN STARTED TO EXPERIENCE SOME MODERATE GROWTH AND, AS EXPECTED,

3M SAW ACCELERATION IN DEMAND FOR CONSUMER ELECTRONICS, ESPECIALLY FLAT-PANEL

LCD TELEVISIONS AND A MORE NORMAL LCD COMPONENT INVENTORY SITUATION. THIS

GROWTH IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2005 DROVE RECORD SALES OF 3MS PROPRIETARY

OPTICAL FILMS AND COMPONENTS DESPITE GROWING PRICING PRESSURE. DISPLAY AND

GRAPHICS SALES GROWTH WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY APPROXIMATELY 4% IN 2005 DUE

TO THE CONTINUED DECLINE IN LENS SYSTEMS FOR THE CRT REAR PROJECTION TELEVISION

MARKET ALONG WITH THE PHASE OUT OF THE COMMERCIAL VIDEOTAPE BUSINESS ANNOUNCED

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 2.3% IN 2005.  OPERATING INCOME WAS IMPACTED BY THE

COMMERCIAL VIDEOTAPE BUSINESS PHASE OUT AND DECLINE IN LENS SYSTEMS FOR THE CRT

REAR PROJECTION TELEVISION MARKET, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED 2005 OPERATING

INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY 8%.

IN 2004, DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS LOCAL-CURRENCY

SALES GROWTH WAS 10.5%. STRONG DEMAND FOR 3M FILMS THAT BRIGHTEN THE DISPLAYS

ON ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS, SUCH AS FLAT-PANEL COMPUTER MONITORS, CELLULAR PHONES,

NOTEBOOK PCS AND LCD TELEVISIONS, CONTINUED TO DRIVE RESULTS IN 2004.

YEAR-ON-YEAR LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH IN THE OPTICAL SYSTEMS BUSINESS WAS SLOWER

IN THE LAST HALF OF 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO INVENTORY CHANNEL ADJUSTMENTS IN THE

LCD MARKET. THIS RESULTED IN REDUCED DEMAND FOR 3MS PROPRIETARY OPTICAL FILMS

AND COMPONENTS. WHILE THIS BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC CUSTOMER INVENTORY

FLUCTUATIONS, 3M BELIEVES THAT THIS BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT

GROWTH ENGINE FOR 3M. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004, 3M ANNOUNCED THE PHASE OUT

OF ITS COMMERCIAL VIDEOTAPE BUSINESS, AND THIS ACTION, COMBINED WITH A

CONTINUING DECLINE IN LENS SYSTEMS FOR THE CRT REAR-PROJECTION TELEVISION

MARKET, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SALES AND OPERATING INCOME. OPERATING INCOME

INCREASED 27.9% TO $1.133 BILLION IN 2004.

SECOND HALF OF 2005, WITH LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005

UP 10.9%. LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH WAS LED BY DEMAND FOR 3M ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS

FOR SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURERS, ALONG WITH CONTINUED STRONG GROWTH IN

ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS USED FOR INSULATING, TESTING AND SENSING. THIS STRONG SALES

GROWTH HELPED OFFSET WEAKNESS IN THE ELECTRONIC SOLUTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS

SEGMENT SERVES A BROAD RANGE OF MARKETS THAT STRIVE TO INCREASE THE SAFETY,

SECURITY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF WORKERS, FACILITIES AND SYSTEMS. MAJOR PRODUCT

OFFERINGS INCLUDE PERSONAL PROTECTION PRODUCTS, SAFETY AND SECURITY PRODUCTS,

ENERGY CONTROL PRODUCTS, CLEANING AND PROTECTION PRODUCTS FOR COMMERCIAL

ESTABLISHMENTS, AND ROOFING GRANULES FOR ASPHALT SHINGLES.

IN 2005, SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH WAS 6.9%, DRIVEN BY BROAD-BASED GROWTH ACROSS THE

BUSINESS PORTFOLIO AND GEOGRAPHIES. THE CONTINUED GLOBAL THREAT OF EVENTS SUCH

AS TERRORISM, NATURAL DISASTERS, SARS AND AVIAN FLU HELPED RAISE THE AWARENESS

IN THE GENERAL PUBLIC ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT,

ESPECIALLY RESPIRATORY PROTECTION FOR OVERALL HEALTH. SALES GROWTH WAS DRIVEN

BY CONTINUED STRONG GLOBAL DEMAND FOR PERSONAL PROTECTION PRODUCTS AND

SOLUTIONS, PARTICULARLY RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS, ALONG WITH STRONG DEMAND

FOR CLEANING AND PROTECTION PRODUCTS FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS. ROOFING GRANULES

FOR ASPHALT SHINGLES ALSO EXPERIENCED SOLID SALES GROWTH. OPERATING INCOME

IMPROVED 12.6% IN 2005.

IN 2004, SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH WAS 6.6%. LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY

STRONG GLOBAL DEMAND FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS, ALONG WITH

CLEANING AND PROTECTIVE PRODUCTS FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS. 3MS ACQUISITION OF

HORNELL HOLDING AB, A EUROPEAN-BASED GLOBAL SUPPLIER OF PERSONAL SAFETY

EQUIPMENT, ADDED 2.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF GROWTH IN 2004. OPERATING INCOME

SEGMENT PROVIDES COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED IN THE MANUFACTURE,

REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF AUTOMOTIVE, MARINE, AIRCRAFT AND SPECIALTY VEHICLES.

IN 2005, TRANSPORTATION LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES

GROWTH WAS 5.0%, WITH BENEFITS FROM CUSTOMER-FOCUSED NEW PRODUCTS AND

PRODUCTIVITY SOLUTIONS DRIVING RESULTS. ONE OF THESE NEW PRODUCTS IS

3M

 PAINT

REPLACEMENT FILM, WHICH

IS AN ALTERNATIVE TO USING PAINT AROUND CAR AND TRUCK WINDOWS. IN THE

AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET AREA, THE 3M

 PAINT

PREPARATION SYSTEM SHORTENS PAINT CHANGEOVER

AND CLEAN-UP TIME WHILE ALSO REDUCING THE USE OF SOLVENTS FOR CLEANING PAINT

GUNS.

SALES GROWTH WAS BROAD BASED

IN TRANSPORTATION, LED BY BUSINESSES THAT SERVE THE AUTOMOTIVE OEMS AND AUTO

BODY REPAIR SHOPS, DESPITE CHALLENGES IN THE U.S. OEM BIG-3 AUTOMOTIVE MARKET

ALONG WITH LOWER LEVELS OF DISTRIBUTION BUY-IN DUE TO CASH FLOW TRADE-OFFS BY

CUSTOMERS IN THE AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESS. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED

8.1% IN 2005.

IN MARCH 2005, 3MS AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS COMPLETED THE PURCHASE FROM

TI&M BETEILIGUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH OF 19 PERCENT OF I&T INNOVATION

TECHNOLOGY (I&T), WHICH WAS FOUNDED IN AUSTRIA IN 1999.  3M AND I&T WILL COLLABORATE TO DELIVER

FLAT FLEXIBLE WIRING SYSTEMS FOR AUTOMOTIVE INTERIOR APPLICATIONS TO THE GLOBAL

AUTOMOTIVE MARKET. THE PURCHASE PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION IS REPORTED

AS INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND AS PURCHASES OF

INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.  DUE TO ITS DISTRIBUTION INVOLVEMENT AND

VOTING RIGHTS, THE COMPANY IS USING EQUITY METHOD ACCOUNTING FOR ITS INVESTMENT

IN I&T. THE COMPANY HAS A PURCHASE OPTION TO BUY AN ADDITIONAL 31%

INVESTMENT OF I&T AFTER CERTAIN CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN MET.  THIS PURCHASE OPTION EXPIRES DECEMBER 31,

2008.  THE COMPANY ALSO HAS A PUT OPTION,

WHICH PROVIDES THE COMPANY THE RIGHT TO SELL BACK ITS ENTIRE OWNERSHIP INTEREST

IN I&T, EXERCISABLE BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2007 AND MARCH 31, 2009, UNLESS THE

COMPANY EXERCISES ITS PURCHASE OPTION BEFORE THEN.

IN 2004, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH WAS 5.1% IN

TRANSPORTATION. TOP-LINE GROWTH IN THIS BUSINESS CONTINUED TO BENEFIT FROM NEW

PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS, ALONG WITH A STRATEGY OF REPLICATING

SUCCESSFUL 3M SOLUTIONS ACROSS SEVERAL DISTINCT SEGMENTS OF THE TRANSPORTATION

INDUSTRY. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 9.8% TO $426 MILLION IN 2004.

WHILE 3M MANAGES ITS BUSINESSES GLOBALLY AND BELIEVES ITS

BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS ARE THE MOST RELEVANT MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE, THE

COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA AS A SECONDARY PERFORMANCE MEASURE.

EXPORT SALES ARE REPORTED WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WHERE THE FINAL SALES TO

3M CUSTOMERS ARE MADE. A PORTION

OF THE

PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS SOLD BY 3MS OPERATIONS TO ITS CUSTOMERS ARE EXPORTED BY

THESE CUSTOMERS TO DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AS CUSTOMERS MOVE THEIR

OPERATIONS FROM ONE GEOGRAPHIC AREA TO ANOTHER, 3MS RESULTS WILL FOLLOW. THUS,

NET SALES IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHY IS NOT INDICATIVE OF END-USER CONSUMPTION

IN THAT GEOGRAPHY.

U.S.

SALES REVENUE INCREASED 4.9%, WITH GROWTH LED BY INDUSTRIAL; CONSUMER AND

OFFICE; AND SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES. ASIA PACIFIC

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES (WHICH EXCLUDE TRANSLATION IMPACTS) INCREASED 10.6%. ALL

SEVEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCREASE IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA,

WITH OPTICAL FILM BEING THE LARGEST GROWTH COMPONENT. JAPAN SALES TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $2.1 BILLION, WITH LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES UP 3.6% FROM 2004.

EUROPEAN LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 0.9%,

WITH GOOD GROWTH IN INDUSTRIAL; SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; AND

TRANSPORTATION. IN THE COMBINED LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA AREA, LOCAL-CURRENCY

SALES INCREASES OF 1.3% WERE LED BY CONSUMER AND OFFICE; INDUSTRIAL; SAFETY,

SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; AND TRANSPORTATION. GROWTH IN LATIN AMERICA

WAS IMPACTED BY THE CONTINUED DECLINE OF 3MS CRT REAR PROJECTION LENS BUSINESS

IN MEXICO AND THE MOVE OF A FLEX CIRCUITS CUSTOMER FROM PUERTO RICO TO

SINGAPORE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION POSITIVELY IMPACTED THE COMBINED

LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA AREA SALES BY 7.4%, AND THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA SALES BY

0.5%, AS THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENED AGAINST THESE CURRENCIES. FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION HAD A MINIMAL IMPACT ON EUROPEAN SALES.

FOR 2005, INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 61% OF 3MS

SALES.

EMPLOYMENT.

EMPLOYMENT INCREASED BY 2,244 PEOPLE SINCE

YEAR-END 2004. THE CUNO ACQUISITION IN AUGUST 2005 ADDED APPROXIMATELY 2,300

EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INCREASE HEADCOUNT IN FASTER-GROWING AREAS

OF THE WORLD, SUCH AS ASIA PACIFIC, PRIMARILY TO SUPPORT INCREASING LOCAL

SALES. EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF CUNO, EMPLOYMENT HAS BEEN DECREASING IN THE

UNITED STATES AND COMBINED EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA AREA. SALES PER

EMPLOYEE IN LOCAL CURRENCIES INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 4% IN 2005, APPROXIMATELY

7% IN 2004 AND 8.5% IN 2003.

CAPITAL

SPENDING/NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

THE BULK OF 3M CAPITAL SPENDING HISTORICALLY HAS

BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES, RESULTING IN HIGHER NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT BALANCES IN THE U.S. THE COMPANY IS STRIVING TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN

ITS MANUFACTURING AND SOURCING WITH GEOGRAPHIC MARKET SALES, AND BECAUSE

APPROXIMATELY 61% OF SALES ARE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THIS WOULD INCREASE PRODUCTION

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, HELPING TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND REDUCE

WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS.  THE 2005

DECREASE IN NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT IN THE EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND

AFRICA AREA WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO C

URRENCY

TRANSLATION (DUE TO THE STRONGER U.S DOLLAR AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 WHEN COMPARED

TO DECEMBER 31, 2004). CAPITAL SPENDING IN ASIA HAS MORE THAN DOUBLED SINCE

2003 AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW OUR PRESENCE IN THIS REGION.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

INFORMATION REGARDING SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS

STATED IN NOTE 1, THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT

TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON

VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE

CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT

THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT

FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

24

THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES RELATE TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, THE COMPANYS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS, AND POTENTIAL ASSET IMPAIRMENT ISSUES. SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS

DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT, SELECTION AND DISCLOSURE OF ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE CATEGORIES OF CLAIMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS

ESTIMATED ITS PROBABLE LIABILITY, THE AMOUNT OF ITS LIABILITY ACCRUALS, AND THE

ESTIMATES OF ITS RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES ARE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. PLEASE REFER TO THE SECTION ENTITLED ACCRUED

LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTAINED

IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH ESTIMATES.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

3M

HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S.

EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS

FOR ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE

INSURANCE BENEFIT PLANS IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 87, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS AND SFAS NO.

106, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS,

WHICH REQUIRE THAT AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BE DETERMINED ON

AN ACTUARIAL BASIS. PENSION BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANS ARE GENERALLY

BASED PRIMARILY ON EACH PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE, COMPENSATION, AND AGE

AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND

THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND

LIABILITY MEASUREMENT. THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE TREND RATE IS THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE ASSUMPTION. SEE NOTE 10 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE

LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES.

THE

COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE

DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLANS. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED

LIABILITIES COULD BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN ESTIMATING

THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS OF

SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN THAT RECEIVE HIGH, INVESTMENT

GRADE RATINGS BY RECOGNIZED RATINGS AGENCIES. USING THESE METHODOLOGIES, THE

COMPANY DETERMINED A DISCOUNT RATE OF 5.50% TO BE APPROPRIATE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, WHICH IS A REDUCTION OF 0.25 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM THE

RATE USED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004.

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY CONVERTED TO THE RP (RETIREMENT PLANS) 2000

MORTALITY TABLE FOR CALCULATING THE YEAR-END 2005 U.S. PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND 2006 EXPENSE. THE IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE

INCREASED THE YEAR-END 2005 U.S. PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR PENSION BY $385

MILLION, THE YEAR-END 2005 U.S. ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR PENSION BY

$349 MILLION AND THE 2005 U.S. ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY

$93 MILLION. THIS CHANGE WILL ALSO INCREASE PENSION EXPENSES FOR 2006 BY $64

MILLION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSES BY $17 MILLION.

A

SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT IN DETERMINING THE COMPANYS PENSION EXPENSE IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS NO. 87 IS THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, WHICH IS BASED ON

HISTORICAL RESULTS FOR SIMILAR ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S.

PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

WAS 8.75% FOR 2005 AND WILL REMAIN AT 8.75% FOR 2006. REFER TO NOTE 10 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THIS RATE IS

DETERMINED.

THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXPECTED RETURN AND THE ACTUAL RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS

DEFERRED AND, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AMORTIZED OVER FUTURE YEARS OF

SERVICE. THEREFORE, THE NET DEFERRAL OF PAST ASSET GAINS (LOSSES) ULTIMATELY

AFFECTS FUTURE PENSION EXPENSE. THIS IS ALSO TRUE OF CHANGES TO ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD NET UNRECOGNIZED PENSION

ACTUARIAL LOSSES OF $2.676 BILLION AND $954 MILLION FOR THE U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL PENSION BENEFIT PLANS, RESPECTIVELY, AND $1.005 BILLION FOR THE

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PLAN. THESE AMOUNTS

REPRESENT POTENTIAL FUTURE PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSES THAT WOULD BE

AMORTIZED OVER AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIODS. THE AVERAGE REMAINING SERVICE

PERIODS FOR U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS AND THE POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

ARE 10.2 YEARS, 14.1 YEARS AND 10.0 YEARS, RESPECTIVELY.

FOR

THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED TOTAL

CONSOLIDATED PRE-TAX PENSION EXPENSE (AFTER SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS AND

SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS) OF $331 MILLION, UP FROM $325 MILLION

IN 2004. PENSION EXPENSE (BEFORE SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS AND SPECIAL

TERMINATION BENEFITS) IS ANTICIPATED TO DECREASE TO APPROXIMATELY

$300 MILLION IN 2006. FOR THE PENSION PLANS, HOLDING ALL OTHER FACTORS

CONSTANT, AN INCREASE/DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN

ASSETS BY 0.25 PERCENTAGE POINTS WOULD DECREASE/INCREASE U.S. 2006 PENSION

EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $22 MILLION FOR U.S. PENSION PLANS AND APPROXIMATELY

$7 MILLION FOR

25

INTERNATIONAL

PENSION PLANS. ALSO, HOLDING ALL OTHER FACTORS CONSTANT, AN INCREASE/DECREASE

IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES BY 0.25 PERCENTAGE POINTS

WOULD DECREASE/INCREASE 2006 PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $31 MILLION FOR

U.S. PENSION PLANS AND APPROXIMATELY $7 MILLION FOR INTERNATIONAL PENSION

PLANS. SEE NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DETAILS OF

THE IMPACT OF A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN ASSUMED HEALTH CARE TREND RATES

ON THE POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE BENEFIT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATION.

POTENTIAL ASSET IMPAIRMENT ISSUES.

3M

NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $5.6 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005. MANAGEMENT MAKES ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR WHICH ACTUAL RESULTS WILL EMERGE OVER

LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THIS INCLUDES THE RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

EMPLOYED IN THE BUSINESS, INCLUDING ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THESE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE CLOSELY MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND PERIODICALLY

ADJUSTED AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. FOR INSTANCE, EXPECTED ASSET LIVES MAY BE

SHORTENED OR AN IMPAIRMENT RECORDED BASED ON A CHANGE IN THE EXPECTED USE OF

THE ASSET OR PERFORMANCE OF THE RELATED BUSINESS REPORTING UNIT.

3M

GOODWILL TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $3.5 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, WHICH, BASED

ON IMPAIRMENT TESTING, IS NOT IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR GOODWILL IS DONE

AT A REPORTING UNIT LEVEL. REPORTING UNITS ARE ONE LEVEL BELOW THE BUSINESS

SEGMENT LEVEL, BUT CAN BE COMBINED WHEN REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE SAME SEGMENT

HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. 3M HAD 18 REPORTING UNITS AT DECEMBER

31, 2005. THE MAJORITY OF GOODWILL RELATES TO AND IS ASSIGNED DIRECTLY TO A

SPECIFIC REPORTING UNIT. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS GENERALLY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNITS NET ASSETS EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT

IS DETERMINED USING EARNINGS FOR THE REPORTING UNIT MULTIPLIED BY A

PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO FOR COMPARABLE INDUSTRY GROUPS, OR BY USING A DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB INTERPRETATION NO.

47, ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FIN

47).  THIS ACCOUNTING STANDARD APPLIES TO

THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED

WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND WHERE THE LIABILITY CAN

BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS EXIST FOR

CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE OBLIGATIONS

IS RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS. OVER TIME THE LIABILITIES ARE

ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE AND THE INITIAL CAPITALIZED COSTS

ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE USEFUL LIVES OF THE RELATED ASSETS.  THE ADOPTION OF FIN 47 RESULTED IN THE

RECOGNITION OF AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION LIABILITY OF $59 MILLION AND AN

AFTER TAX CHARGE OF $35 MILLION, WHICH IS REFLECTED AS A CUMULATIVE CHANGE IN

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE PRO FORMA

EFFECT OF APPLYING THIS GUIDANCE IN ALL PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED WAS DETERMINED

NOT TO BE MATERIAL.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, 3M ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123

(REVISED 2004), SHARE-BASED PAYMENT, WHICH REQUIRES 3M TO EXPENSE STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE. THE COMPANY IS ADOPTING SFAS NO. 123R USING THE MODIFIED

RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. ALL PRIOR PERIODS WILL BE ADJUSTED TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE

FAIR-VALUE-BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN FISCAL YEARS

BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 1995. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION DISCLOSURES IN

NOTE 1 REFLECT PRO FORMA EXPENSE OF $.14 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE IN 2005.

THE 2006 IMPACT

OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 123R IS ESTIMATED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $.16 PER DILUTED

SHARE WITH AN ESTIMATED $0.02 PER DILUTED SHARE COST IN THE FIRST QUARTER, AN

ESTIMATED $0.08 PER DILUTED SHARE COST IN THE SECOND QUARTER, AND AN ESTIMATED

$0.03 PER DILUTED SHARE COST IN BOTH THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS. THE PRO

FORMA IMPACT OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

PROVIDED IN NOTE 1 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, 2004 AND 2003, WAS

RECOGNIZED OVER THE NOMINAL VESTING PERIOD, WHEREBY IF AN EMPLOYEE RETIRED

BEFORE THE END OF THE VESTING PERIOD, THE COMPANY WOULD RECOGNIZE ANY REMAINING

UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST AT THE DATE OF RETIREMENT. SFAS NO. 123R

REQUIRES RECOGNITION UNDER A NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING PERIOD APPROACH, REQUIRING

COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNITION WHEN AN EMPLOYEE IS ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE. 3M

EMPLOYEES IN THE U.S. ARE ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE BEGINNING AT AGE 55 AND AFTER

HAVING COMPLETED FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE. APPROXIMATELY 25 TO 30% OF THE NUMBER

OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS ARE MADE TO THIS POPULATION. THE COMPANY

WILL CHANGE TO THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING PERIOD APPROACH FOR NEW STOCK

COMPENSATION GRANTS MADE AFTER THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R ON

JANUARY 1, 2006. THEREFORE, PRIMARILY BEGINNING IN MAY 2006 WITH THE ANNUAL

MANAGEMENT STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM GRANT, IMMEDIATE EXPENSING OF THOSE

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE WILL

RESULT IN A HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAN HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED IN COMPARABLE

PRIOR PERIODS.

THE TOTAL EXPENSE IN 2006

AND BEYOND WILL DEPEND ON SEVERAL VARIABLES, INCLUDING THE NUMBER OF

SHARE-BASED AWARDS GRANTED, THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE AWARDS, AND THE PERIOD THE

VESTING OF THOSE AWARDS IS RECOGNIZED OVER; THEREFORE THE ACTUAL EXPENSE MAY BE

DIFFERENT FROM THIS ESTIMATE.

BELIEVES ITS ONGOING CASH FLOWS PROVIDE AMPLE CASH TO FUND EXPECTED INVESTMENTS

AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE COMPANY HAS AN AA CREDIT RATING FROM STANDARD

& POORS AND AN AA1 CREDIT RATING FROM MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE. THE

COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS TO MEET CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED

GROWTH AND ACQUISITION INVESTMENT FUNDING NEEDS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT UTILIZE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS LINKED TO THE COMPANYS STOCK. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DOES

HAVE CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT THAT, IF CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET,

IS CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK (REFER TO NOTE 8 IN THIS

DOCUMENT).

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, REMAINED STRONG.

VARIOUS

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING CASH AND SHORT-TERM DEBT, CAN FLUCTUATE

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MONTH-TO-MONTH DEPENDING ON SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

WORKING CAPITAL (DEFINED AS CURRENT ASSETS MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES)

TOTALED $1.877 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, COMPARED WITH $2.649 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO A DECREASE IN CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS ($1.685 BILLION) PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN

DEBT CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT

($1.022 BILLION). THE CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE WAS IMPACTED BY THE

ACQUISITION OF CUNO AND REPAYMENT OF DEBT.

THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS WORKING CAPITAL MEASURES THAT

PLACE EMPHASIS AND FOCUS ON CERTAIN WORKING CAPITAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

THESE MEASURES ARE NOT DEFINED UNDER U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES AND MAY NOT BE COMPUTED THE SAME AS

SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES

USED BY OTHER COMPANIES.  ONE OF THE

PRIMARY WORKING CAPITAL MEASURES

3M USES IS

A COMBINED INDEX, WHICH INCLUDES ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES, INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE. THIS COMBINED INDEX (DEFINED AS QUARTERLY NET SALES  FOURTH QUARTER

AT YEAR-END  MULTIPLIED BY FOUR, DIVIDED BY ENDING NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

PLUS INVENTORY LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE) WAS 5.7 AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, DOWN FROM

5.8 AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. EXCLUDING CUNO, NET WORKING CAPITAL TURNS AT DECEMBER

31, 2005, WERE 5.8, THE SAME AS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. RECEIVABLES INCREASED $46

MILLION, OR 1.6%, COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2004. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE

CUNO ACQUISITION INCREASED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BY $88 MILLION. CURRENCY

TRANSLATION (DUE TO THE STRONGER U.S DOLLAR) REDUCED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BY

$231 MILLION YEAR-ON-YEAR. INVENTORIES INCREASED $265 MILLION, OR 14.0%,

COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2004. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE CUNO ACQUISITION

INCREASED INVENTORIES BY $56 MILLION. CURRENCY TRANSLATION REDUCED INVENTORIES

BY $89 MILLION YEAR-ON-YEAR. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCREASED $88 MILLION COMPARED

WITH DECEMBER 31, 2004, WITH CUNO ACCOUNTING FOR $18 MILLION OF THIS INCREASE.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING

ACTIVITIES ARE PROVIDED IN THE TABLES THAT FOLLOW. INDIVIDUAL AMOUNTS IN THE

FLOWS FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO

PERIOD, AS PENSION FUNDING DECISIONS, TAX TIMING DIFFERENCES AND OTHER ITEMS

CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT CASH FLOWS. IN 2005, CASH FLOW WAS ESSENTIALLY FLAT

WHEN COMPARED TO 2004. HIGHER NET INCOME, HIGHER ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND INCREASED

INSURANCE RECEIVABLE COLLECTIONS WERE OFFSET BY ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE INCREASES,

INVENTORY INCREASES AND OTHER ITEMS. PRODUCT AND OTHER INSURANCE RECEIVABLES

AND CLAIMS INCREASED CASH FLOW BY $122 MILLION IN 2005, BENEFITING FROM THE

$148 MILLION IN INSURANCE RECOVERIES FOR THE BREAST IMPLANT MATTER IN 2005.

FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THESE AND OTHER

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, REFER TO NOTE 11 IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF

THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K. THE CATEGORY OTHER  NET IN THE PRECEDING

TABLE REFLECTS CHANGES IN OTHER ASSET AND LIABILITY ACCOUNTS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN

2005, THIS CATEGORY INCLUDES THE NON-CASH IMPACT OF ADOPTING FIN 47 ($35

MILLION CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE), INCREASES IN ACCRUED

LIABILITIES (SUCH AS THE $30 MILLION INCREASE IN LIABILITY RELATED TO LEGAL

SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS), AND OTHER ITEMS.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY MADE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $500

MILLION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN, WITH $200 MILLION CONTRIBUTED IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005, AND $300 MILLION CONTRIBUTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER

OF 2005. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY MADE A SPECIAL PENSION

CONTRIBUTION TO 3MS JAPANESE PENSION PLAN OF $155 MILLION AND A DISCRETIONARY

CONTRIBUTION OF $300 MILLION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2003, 3M MADE A DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION OF $600 MILLION TO ITS

U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL DEPEND ON MARKET

CONDITIONS, INTEREST RATES AND OTHER FACTORS. 3M BELIEVES ITS STRONG CASH FLOW

AND BALANCE SHEET WILL ALLOW IT TO FUND FUTURE PENSION NEEDS WITHOUT COMPROMISING

GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.

IN 2004, CASH FLOW IMPROVEMENTS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET

INCOME. IN ALL PERIODS PRESENTED, SIGNIFICANT COMPANY PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED CASH FLOWS.

IN ALL

YEARS, WITH A LARGER AMOUNT IN 2003, A PORTION OF THE TAX TIMING BENEFIT

RELATES TO THE TAX BENEFIT RECEIVED FROM COMPANY PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS.

INVESTMENTS

IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE ENABLING GROWTH IN DIVERSE MARKETS,

HELPING TO MEET PRODUCT DEMAND AND INCREASING MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY.

THESE INVESTMENTS WILL CONTINUE TO BE PRIMARILY

CAPACITY AND GROWTH FOCUSED. FOR EXAMPLE, IN DECEMBER 2005,

3M ANNOUNCED

ITS INTENTION TO BUILD AN LCD OPTICAL FILM MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN POLAND TO

SUPPORT THE FAST-GROWING LCD-TV MARKET IN EUROPE AND TO BETTER SERVE ITS

CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS 2006 CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY

$1.1 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $943 MILLION IN 2005.

IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005, 3M COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF CUNO. 3M ACQUIRED

CUNO FOR APPROXIMATELY $1.36 BILLION, INCLUDING ASSUMPTION OF DEBT. THIS $1.36

BILLION INCLUDED $1.27 BILLION OF CASH PAID (NET OF CASH ACQUIRED) AND THE

ASSUMPTION OF $80 MILLION OF DEBT, MOST OF WHICH HAS BEEN REPAID. IN 2005, THE

COMPANY ALSO ENTERED INTO TWO ADDITIONAL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS FOR A TOTAL

PURCHASE PRICE OF $27 MILLION. REFER TO NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THESE 2005 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, AND FOR

INFORMATION CONCERNING 2004 AND 2003 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS.

PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS IN 2005 INCLUDE THE PURCHASE FROM TI&M

BETEILIGUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH OF 19 PERCENT OF I&T INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY

(DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY UNDER THE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS SEGMENT). THE PURCHASE

PRICE OF APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION IS REPORTED AS INVESTMENTS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND AS PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS.

OTHER PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS AND PROCEEDS FROM

SALE OF INVESTMENTS IN 2005 ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AUCTION RATE SECURITIES,

WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. PRIOR TO 2005, PURCHASES OF AND

PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF AUCTION RATE SECURITIES WERE CLASSIFIED AS CASH AND

CASH EQUIVALENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE AMOUNT OF SUCH SECURITIES TAKEN AS

A WHOLE WAS IMMATERIAL TO CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND ACCORDINGLY WERE NOT

RECLASSIFIED FOR 2004 AND PRIOR.

P

ROCEEDS

FROM THE SALE OF INVESTMENTS IN 2003 INCLUDE $26 MILLION OF CASH RECEIVED

RELATED TO THE SALE OF 3MS 50% OWNERSHIP IN DUREL CORPORATION TO ROGERS

CORPORATION. ADDITIONAL P

URCHASES OF

INVESTMENTS TOTALED $5 MILLION IN 2005, $10 MILLION IN 2004 AND

$16 MILLION IN 2003. THESE PURCHASES INCLUDE ADDITIONAL SURVIVOR BENEFIT

INSURANCE AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

YEAR-END 2004, WITH THE DECREASE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RETIREMENT OF

$400 MILLION IN MEDIUM-TERM NOTES.

THERE

WERE NO NEW LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCES IN 2005.

IN 2005, THE CASH FLOW

DECREASE IN NET SHORT-TERM DEBT OF $258 MILLION INCLUDES THE PORTION OF

SHORT-TERM DEBT WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF 90 DAYS OR LESS. THE REPAYMENT OF

DEBT OF $656 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE RETIREMENT OF $400 MILLION IN

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND COMMERCIAL PAPER RETIREMENTS. PROCEEDS FROM DEBT OF $429

MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES.

TOTAL DEBT WAS 19% OF TOTAL CAPITAL

(TOTAL

CAPITAL IS DEFINED AS DEBT PLUS EQUITY),

COMPARED WITH 21% AT YEAR-END 2004.

DEBT

SECURITIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHELF REGISTRATION, ITS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES

PROGRAM, DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES AND CONVERTIBLE NOTE, ARE ALL DISCUSSED

IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 3M HAS A

SHELF REGISTRATION AND MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH $1.5 BILLION OF

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MAY BE OFFERED. IN 2004, THE COMPANY ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $62

MILLION IN DEBT SECURITIES UNDER ITS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM. NO DEBT WAS

ISSUED UNDER THIS PROGRAM IN 2005.

THE MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM AND SHELF REGISTRATION

HAVE REMAINING CAPACITY OF APPROXIMATELY $1.438 BILLION. T

HE

COMPANYS $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES (CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT

PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT) WERE REMARKETED FOR ONE YEAR IN DECEMBER 2005. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS CONVERTIBLE NOTES WITH A BOOK VALUE OF $539 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

29

THE

NEXT PUT OPTION DATE FOR THESE CONVERTIBLE NOTES IS NOVEMBER 2007, THUS AT

YEAR-END 2005 THIS DEBT IS CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM DEBT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005,

THE DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES AND $62 MILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES ARE

CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS THE RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING

PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT WILL AFFECT ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE,

REFER TO NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DISCUSSION OF EITF

ISSUE NO. 04-08, THE EFFECT OF CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT ON DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE AND PROPOSED SFAS NO. 128R, EARNINGS PER SHARE.

REPURCHASES OF COMMON STOCK ARE MADE TO SUPPORT

THE COMPANYS STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS AND FOR OTHER CORPORATE

PURPOSES.

ON

NOVEMBER 8, 2004, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE PURCHASE OF  $2.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK

BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2005 AND JANUARY 31, 2006.

IN OCTOBER 2005, 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF AN

ADDITIONAL $300 MILLION OF THE COMPANYS STOCK THROUGH JANUARY 31, 2006.  THIS INCREASED THE TOTAL REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION

TO $2.3 BILLION FOR THE PERIOD THROUGH JANUARY 31, 2006. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005, SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THIS REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION HAD BEEN UTILIZED.

REFER TO THE TABLE CAPTIONED ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES IN PART

II, ITEM 5, FOR MORE INFORMATION.

CASH DIVIDENDS PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS TOTALED $1.286 BILLION ($1.68 PER

SHARE) IN 2005, $1.125 BILLION ($1.44 PER SHARE) IN 2004 AND $1.034 BILLION

($1.32 PER SHARE) IN 2003. 3M HAS PAID DIVIDENDS SINCE 1916.

OTHER CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE

DISTRIBUTIONS TO MINORITY INTERESTS, CHANGES IN CASH OVERDRAFT BALANCES, AND

PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FOR CAPITAL LEASES.

LIQUIDITY.

THE

COMPANYS LIQUIDITY REMAINS STRONG. PRIMARY SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARE

PROVIDED THROUGH U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER AND EURO COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES. AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, OUTSTANDING TOTAL COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED TOTALED $514

MILLION AND AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY $823 MILLION DURING 2005. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE

SHELF BORROWING CAPACITY TOTALED $1.438 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. CREDIT

SUPPORT FOR OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER IS PROVIDED BY A $565 MILLION CREDIT

AGREEMENT AMONG A GROUP OF PRIMARY RELATIONSHIP BANKS.  IN MARCH 2005, THE COMPANY REPLACED ITS

364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH A FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT WITH SIMILAR TERMS.

THIS $565 MILLION CREDIT FACILITY PROVIDES UP TO $115 MILLION IN LETTERS OF

CREDIT ($97 MILLION OF WHICH WAS UTILIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2005), WITH

PROVISIONS FOR INCREASING THIS LIMIT UP TO $150 MILLION.

COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES OF $53 MILLION ARE IN

PLACE ACROSS SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARY LOCATIONS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ITS ACCESS TO

THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET WILL BE RESTRICTED. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND

CERTAIN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY TO MEET NEAR

TERM OBLIGATIONS, IF NECESSARY.

AT

YEAR-END 2005, CERTAIN DEBT AGREEMENTS ($350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE

SECURITIES AND $165 MILLION OF ESOP DEBT) HAD RATINGS TRIGGERS (BBB-/BAA3

OR LOWER) THAT WOULD REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF DEBT. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS

AA/AA1 DEBT RATINGS. IN ADDITION, THE $565 MILLION, FIVE-YEAR CREDIT AGREEMENT

REQUIRES 3M TO MAINTAIN A CAPITALIZATION RATIO AT NO MORE THAN 0.60 TO 1 AT THE

END OF EACH QUARTER. THIS RATIO IS CALCULATED AS FUNDED DEBT (INCLUDING ALL

BORROWED MONEY AND LETTERS OF CREDIT UTILIZED) TO THE SUM OF FUNDED DEBT AND

EQUITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THIS RATIO WAS APPROXIMATELY 0.20 TO 1.

3MS CASH BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 TOTALED $1.072

BILLION. 3MS STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH

SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES GOING

FORWARD. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ITS OPERATIONS TO DRIVE GROWTH,

INCLUDING CONTINUAL REVIEW OF ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES. 3M PAID DIVIDENDS OF

$1.286 BILLION IN 2005, AND HAS A LONG HISTORY OF DIVIDEND INCREASES. IN

FEBRUARY 2006, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON 3M

COMMON STOCK BY 9.5% TO 46 CENTS PER SHARE, EQUIVALENT TO AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF

$1.84 PER SHARE. IN FEBRUARY 2006, 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS ALSO AUTHORIZED THE

PURCHASE OF UP TO $2.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK BETWEEN FEBRUARY

13, 2006 AND FEBRUARY 28, 2007. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO MAKE ADDITIONAL

CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS PENSION PLAN IN THE FUTURE, BUT EXACT AMOUNTS ARE

UNCERTAIN AND WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE

COMPANY HAD NOT UTILIZED SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES TO FACILITATE OFF-BALANCE

SHEET FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. 3MS ACCRUED PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITIES,

RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS PART OF CURRENT AND LONG-TERM

LIABILITIES, ARE ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY $22 MILLION. 3M DOES NOT CONSIDER

THIS AMOUNT TO BE MATERIAL.

THE FAIR

VALUE OF 3M GUARANTEES OF LOANS WITH THIRD PARTIES AND OTHER GUARANTEE

ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.

IN ADDITION TO GUARANTEES, 3M, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS,

PERIODICALLY ENTERS INTO AGREEMENTS THAT REQUIRE 3M TO INDEMNIFY EITHER MAJOR

CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS FOR SPECIFIC RISKS, SUCH AS CLAIMS FOR INJURY OR

PROPERTY DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF 3M PRODUCTS OR THE NEGLIGENCE OF 3M PERSONNEL,

OR CLAIMS ALLEGING THAT 3M PRODUCTS INFRINGE THIRD

30

PARTY PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WHILE 3MS MAXIMUM

EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS CANNOT BE ESTIMATED, THESE

INDEMNIFICATIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DEBT PAYMENTS DUE IN 2006 INCLUDE $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE

SECURITIES (FINAL MATURITY 2010) AND $62 MILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES (FINAL

MATURITY 2044). THESE SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM

DEBT AS THE RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS.

THE NEXT DATE ON WHICH INVESTORS CAN REQUIRE REPURCHASE OF THE CONVERTIBLE

NOTES IS 2007, THUS IN THE ABOVE SCHEDULE THIS IS CONSIDERED DUE IN 2007 (FINAL

MATURITY 2032).

UNCONDITIONAL

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS ARE DEFINED AS AN AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES

THAT IS ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING ON THE COMPANY. INCLUDED IN THE

UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS CATEGORY ABOVE ARE CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS

RELATED TO TAKE OR PAY CONTRACTS, CAPITAL COMMITMENTS, SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND

UTILITIES. THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE BOTH UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH

TERMS IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR AND NORMAL ONGOING PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH TERMS

OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR. MANY OF THESE COMMITMENTS RELATE TO TAKE OR PAY

CONTRACTS, IN WHICH 3M GUARANTEES PAYMENT TO ENSURE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES THAT ARE SOLD TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE

CONSIDERATION (PRODUCTS OR SERVICES) FOR THESE UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS. THE PURCHASE OBLIGATION AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE ENTIRE

ANTICIPATED PURCHASES IN THE FUTURE, BUT REPRESENT ONLY THOSE ITEMS FOR WHICH

THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED. THE MAJORITY OF 3MS PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES ARE PURCHASED AS NEEDED, WITH NO UNCONDITIONAL COMMITMENT. FOR THIS

REASON, THESE AMOUNTS WILL NOT PROVIDE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS

EXPECTED FUTURE CASH OUTFLOWS ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 10 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED MINIMUM PENSION CONTRIBUTION

OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2006. THUS, COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS U.S.

AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LARGELY DISCRETIONARY IN

2006 AND FUTURE YEARS. CONTRACTUAL CAPITAL COMMITMENTS ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE

PRECEDING TABLE, BUT THESE COMMITMENTS REPRESENT A SMALL PART OF THE COMPANYS

EXPECTED CAPITAL SPENDING IN 2006 AND BEYOND.

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL DERIVATIVE

ARRANGEMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXPOSURE, INTEREST RATE RISKS AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS. A FINANCIAL RISK

MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, COMPOSED OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT, PROVIDES OVERSIGHT FOR

RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES. THIS COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL RISK POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES, AND PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT UTILIZATION. THIS COMMITTEE ALSO ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES

FOR CONTROL AND VALUATION, RISK ANALYSIS, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL, AND

ONGOING MONITORING AND REPORTING.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD

CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAPS TO HEDGE AGAINST THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN

INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. IN 2001, THE COMPANY INCREASED THE AMOUNT

AND DURATION OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES TO HELP LESSEN YEAR-OVER-YEAR

IMPACTS AND TO IMPROVE THE PREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE EARNINGS. HOWEVER, THIS

HEDGING PROGRAM DOES NOT MAKE 3M IMMUNE TO CURRENCY IMPACTS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES INTEREST RATE RISKS USING A

MIX OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATE DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE BORROWING COSTS, THE

COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE

COMPANY AGREES TO EXCHANGE, AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

FIXED AND FLOATING INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO

31

AN AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. THE

COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS,

PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE STATISTICAL MODELING

TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO TEST THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY AND

INTEREST RATES AND ASSESS THE RISK OF LOSS IN AFTER-TAX EARNINGS OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVES AND UNDERLYING EXPOSURES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31,

2005. THE MODEL (THIRD-PARTY BANK DATASET) USED A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL OVER A

12-MONTH TIME HORIZON. BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST RATE

RISKS, POSSIBLE INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON AFTER-TAX EARNINGS ($2 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND $5 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004). A DECREASE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD HAVE INCREASED AFTER-TAX

EARNINGS BY $2 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS OF

THE PRIMARY FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS, POSSIBLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES

WOULD HAVE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AFTER-TAX EARNINGS BY $69 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2005 ($61 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004). A POSITIVE CHANGE IN EXCHANGE RATES

WOULD HAVE BENEFITED AFTER-TAX EARNINGS BY $66 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

WHEN INCLUDING CERTAIN COMMODITY RISKS, POSSIBLE CHANGES IN COMMODITY RATES

WOULD HAVE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AFTER-TAX EARNINGS BY AN ADDITIONAL $4 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005 (AN ADDITIONAL $10 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004). A POSITIVE

CHANGE IN COMMODITY RATES WOULD NOT HAVE MATERIALLY IMPACTED AFTER-TAX EARNINGS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE MODEL USED ANALYZED OVER 20 DIFFERENT CURRENCIES AND

FIVE COMMODITIES, BUT DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT WHAT ACTUALLY WILL BE

EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY. THIS MODEL DOES NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN HEDGE

TRANSACTIONS, BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THEIR INCLUSION WOULD NOT MATERIALLY

IMPACT THE RESULTS.

THE GLOBAL EXPOSURES

RELATED TO PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS ARE SUCH THAT A ONE PERCENT PRICE

CHANGE WOULD RESULT IN A PRE-TAX COST OR SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $45 MILLION

PER YEAR. THE GLOBAL ENERGY EXPOSURE IS SUCH THAT A 10% PRICE CHANGE WOULD

RESULT IN A PRE-TAX COST OR SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $35 MILLION PER YEAR.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE USED TO HEDGE LESS THAN TWO PERCENT OF THE PURCHASED

COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS EXPOSURE AND ARE USED TO HEDGE APPROXIMATELY 10% OF

THIS ENERGY EXPOSURE.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES

ABOUT MARKET RISK.

IN

THE CONTEXT OF ITEM 7A, MARKET RISK REFERS TO THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM

ADVERSE CHANGES IN FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT MARKET RATES AND PRICES,

SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE

COMPANY DISCUSSES RISK MANAGEMENT IN VARIOUS PLACES THROUGHOUT THIS DOCUMENT,

INCLUDING DISCUSSIONS IN ITEM 7 CONCERNING FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY,

AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS (LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, DERIVATIVES AND OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND THE DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES ACCOUNTING

POLICY). ALL DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY IS GOVERNED BY WRITTEN POLICIES, AND A VALUE-AT-RISK

ANALYSIS IS PROVIDED FOR THESE DERIVATIVES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE LEVERAGED

DERIVATIVE POSITIONS.  HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY DOES HAVE CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT THAT, IF CONDITIONS FOR

CONVERSION ARE MET, IS CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK (REFER TO

NOTE 8 IN THIS DOCUMENT).

MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR THE INTEGRITY AND OBJECTIVITY OF THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS

REPORT. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WHERE

NECESSARY, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT ESTIMATES BASED ON MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT.

MANAGEMENT HAS ESTABLISHED

AND MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF INTERNAL ACCOUNTING AND OTHER CONTROLS FOR THE

COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THIS SYSTEM AND ITS ESTABLISHED ACCOUNTING

PROCEDURES AND RELATED CONTROLS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

THAT ASSETS ARE SAFEGUARDED, THAT THE BOOKS AND RECORDS PROPERLY REFLECT ALL

TRANSACTIONS, THAT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE IMPLEMENTED BY QUALIFIED

PERSONNEL, AND THAT PUBLISHED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PROPERLY PREPARED AND

FAIRLY PRESENTED. THE COMPANYS SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL IS SUPPORTED BY

WIDELY COMMUNICATED WRITTEN POLICIES, INCLUDING BUSINESS CONDUCT POLICIES,

WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO REQUIRE ALL EMPLOYEES TO MAINTAIN HIGH ETHICAL STANDARDS

IN THE CONDUCT OF COMPANY AFFAIRS. INTERNAL AUDITORS CONTINUALLY REVIEW THE

ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL SYSTEM.

3M COMPANY

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY

THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.

BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005,

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE.

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, EXCLUDED CUNO, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY IN

AUGUST 2005 IN A PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION. CUNO IS A WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY WHOSE TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL NET SALES REPRESENTED

LESS THAN 10% OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS AND LESS THAN 1% OF CONSOLIDATED NET

SALES, RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2005. COMPANIES ARE ALLOWED TO EXCLUDE ACQUISITIONS FROM THEIR ASSESSMENT OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF AN

ACQUISITION WHILE INTEGRATING THE ACQUIRED COMPANY UNDER GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED

BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

MANAGEMENTS

ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY

PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM,

AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT

REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 3M

COMPANY.

WE

HAVE COMPLETED INTEGRATED AUDITS OF 3M COMPANYS 2005 AND 2004 CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND AN AUDIT OF ITS 2003 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT

BOARD (UNITED STATES).  OUR OPINIONS, BASED ON OUR AUDITS, ARE

PRESENTED BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

IN

OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS LISTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

INDEX PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION

OF 3M COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, AND THE

RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN

THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005

IN CONFORMITY

WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT.

OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED

ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS OF THESE STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL

MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST

BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES

MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT

PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR

OPINION.

AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, EFFECTIVE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FASB INTERPRETATION

NO. 47, ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENT'S

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX,

THAT THE COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005 BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO), IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THOSE CRITERIA. FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE

COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY COSO. THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS

OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE

CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED

STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN

REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS.  AN AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING

THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH

OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDER NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT

OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING

AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE

WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

(I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL,

ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS

OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE

RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND

EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH

AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND

(III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY

DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS

ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

35

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT

PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.  ALSO,

PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO

THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS,

OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY

DETERIORATE.

AS

DESCRIBED IN MANAGEMENT'S REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

IN THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX, MANAGEMENT HAS EXCLUDED CUNO FROM ITS ASSESSMENT OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, BECAUSE IT

WAS ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY IN A PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION DURING 2005. WE

HAVE ALSO EXCLUDED CUNO FROM OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING.

CUNO IS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY WHOSE TOTAL ASSETS AND

TOTAL NET SALES REPRESENTED LESS THAN 10% AND LESS THAN 1%, RESPECTIVELY, OF

THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AMOUNTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING

POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION.

3M IS A DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL MANUFACTURER,

TECHNOLOGY INNOVATOR AND MARKETER OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS. ALL

SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY

TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERM 3M OR COMPANY REFERS

TO 3M COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

LOCAL CURRENCIES GENERALLY ARE CONSIDERED THE FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR OPERATIONS IN

LOCAL-CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS ARE TRANSLATED AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES. INCOME

AND EXPENSE ITEMS ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING

THE YEAR. CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

RECLASSIFICATIONS.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN THE PRIOR YEARS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

HAVE

BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

COSTS OF INTERNALLY DEVELOPED PATENTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO RESEARCH,

DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES FROM SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES. COSTS OF INTERNALLY DEVELOPED PATENTS INCLUDE COSTS AND FEES

INCURRED TO PREPARE, FILE, SECURE AND MAINTAIN PATENTS.

USE OF ESTIMATES.

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS

OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS

OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD

DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH AND

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS WHEN PURCHASED.

INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE THE CASH SURRENDER

VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES, REAL ESTATE NOT USED IN THE BUSINESS, VENTURE

CAPITAL AND EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO

INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

INVENTORIES.

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT LOWER OF COST OR

MARKET, WITH COST GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING

CAPITALIZED INTEREST AND INTERNAL ENGINEERING COSTS, ARE RECORDED AT COST.

DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT GENERALLY IS COMPUTED USING THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD BASED ON THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS PRIMARILY RANGE FROM 10 TO

40 YEARS, WITH THE MAJORITY IN THE RANGE OF 20 TO 40 YEARS. MACHINERY AND

EQUIPMENT ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES PRIMARILY RANGE FROM THREE TO 15 YEARS, WITH

THE MAJORITY IN THE RANGE OF FIVE TO 10 YEARS. FULLY DEPRECIATED ASSETS ARE

RETAINED IN PROPERTY AND ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTS UNTIL DISPOSAL. UPON

DISPOSAL, ASSETS AND RELATED ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE

ACCOUNTS AND THE NET AMOUNT, LESS PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSAL, IS CHARGED OR

CREDITED TO OPERATIONS. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AMOUNTS ARE REVIEWED FOR

IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET (ASSET GROUP) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN IMPAIRMENT

LOSS WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE

ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE

ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE

RECORDED IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUE OVER ITS

FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

ANALYSIS.

GOODWILL.

GOODWILL

IS THE EXCESS OF COST OF AN ACQUIRED ENTITY OVER THE AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO ASSETS

ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. GOODWILL IS NOT

AMORTIZED. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, AND WILL BE TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT

WOULD INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY BE IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR

GOODWILL IS DONE AT A REPORTING UNIT LEVEL. REPORTING UNITS ARE ONE LEVEL BELOW

THE BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL, BUT CAN BE COMBINED WHEN REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE

SAME SEGMENT HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. 3M HAD 18 REPORTING UNITS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. THE MAJORITY OF GOODWILL RELATES TO AND IS ASSIGNED

DIRECTLY TO A SPECIFIC REPORTING UNIT. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS GENERALLY WOULD BE

RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNITS NET ASSETS EXCEEDS

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A

REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED USING EARNINGS FOR THE REPORTING UNIT MULTIPLIED

BY A PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO FOR COMPARABLE INDUSTRY GROUPS, OR BY USING A

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT TEST IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005 AND DETERMINED THAT NO GOODWILL

WAS IMPAIRED.

41

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

INTANGIBLE

ASSETS INCLUDE PATENTS, TRADENAMES AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM AN

INDEPENDENT PARTY. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE, NAMELY CERTAIN

TRADENAMES, ARE NOT AMORTIZED. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE ARE

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, WITH ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM

TWO TO 20 YEARS. INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT

ANNUALLY, AND WILL BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT

OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY

BE IMPAIRED. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT

WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT A CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET

(ASSET GROUP) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT NO

MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS EXISTED AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005.

AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN

ASSET EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USED IN DETERMINING THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECORDED IS

CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUE OVER ITS FAIR VALUE.

FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. COSTS

RELATED TO INTERNALLY DEVELOPED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS PATENTS, ARE

EXPENSED AS INCURRED, PRIMARILY IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

REVENUE (SALES) RECOGNITION.

THE COMPANY SELLS A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A

DIVERSIFIED BASE OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD AND HAS NO MATERIAL

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE

RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE

SUBSTANTIVELY TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS. THIS CONDITION NORMALLY IS MET WHEN THE

PRODUCT HAS BEEN DELIVERED OR UPON PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES.

THE COMPANY RECORDS ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO

REVENUE FOR CUSTOMER AND DISTRIBUTOR INCENTIVES, SUCH AS REBATES, AT THE TIME

OF THE INITIAL SALE, WITH THESE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS BASED ON SALES TERMS,

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TREND ANALYSIS AND PROJECTED MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE

VARIOUS MARKETS SERVED.

THE MAJORITY OF 3MS SALES

AGREEMENTS ARE FOR STANDARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE

OCCURRING UPON DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCT OR PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE. 3M ALSO

ENTERS INTO AGREEMENTS THAT CONTAIN MULTIPLE-ELEMENTS (SUCH AS EQUIPMENT,

INSTALLATION AND SERVICE) OR NON-STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS. FOR

MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, 3M RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR DELIVERED ELEMENTS

WHEN THE DELIVERED ITEM HAS STAND-ALONE VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER, FAIR VALUES OF

UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS ARE KNOWN, CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF THE DELIVERED ELEMENTS

HAS OCCURRED, AND THERE ARE ONLY CUSTOMARY REFUND OR RETURN RIGHTS RELATED TO THE

DELIVERED ELEMENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE PRECEDING CONDITIONS, EQUIPMENT REVENUE

IS NOT RECORDED UNTIL THE INSTALLATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED IF EQUIPMENT

ACCEPTANCE IS DEPENDENT UPON INSTALLATION, OR IF INSTALLATION IS ESSENTIAL TO

THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE EQUIPMENT. INSTALLATION REVENUES ARE NOT RECORDED

UNTIL INSTALLATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED. FOR PREPAID SERVICE CONTRACTS, SALES

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT,

UNLESS HISTORICAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THE COSTS ARE INCURRED ON OTHER THAN A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. LICENSE FEE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EARNED, WITH NO

REVENUE RECOGNIZED UNTIL THE INCEPTION OF THE LICENSE TERM.

ON OCCASION, AGREEMENTS WILL CONTAIN MILESTONES,

OR 3M WILL RECOGNIZE REVENUE BASED ON PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE. FOR THESE

AGREEMENTS, AND DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFICS, 3M MAY RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON

COMPLETION OF A SUBSTANTIVE MILESTONE, OR IN PROPORTION TO COSTS INCURRED TO

DATE COMPARED WITH THE ESTIMATE OF TOTAL COSTS TO BE INCURRED.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCES.

TRADE

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE RECORDED AT THE INVOICED AMOUNT AND DO NOT BEAR

INTEREST. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ALLOWANCES FOR BAD DEBTS, CASH DISCOUNTS,

PRODUCT RETURNS AND VARIOUS OTHER ITEMS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

AND PRODUCT RETURNS IS BASED ON THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE

CREDIT LOSSES IN EXISTING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ANTICIPATED SALES RETURNS.

THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ALLOWANCES BASED ON HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE

BY INDUSTRY AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC DATA AND HISTORICAL SALES RETURNS. THE

COMPANY REVIEWS THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS MONTHLY. THE COMPANY DOES

NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE-SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

ADVERTISING AND MERCHANDISING.

THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS IN THE YEAR

INCURRED, AND TOTALED $457 MILLION IN 2005, $433 MILLION IN 2004 AND $405

MILLION IN 2003.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS IN THE YEAR

INCURRED AND ARE SHOWN ON A SEPARATE LINE OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, COVERING BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

AND THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND

IMPROVED PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, TOTALED $798 MILLION IN 2005, $759 MILLION IN

2004 AND $749 MILLION IN 2003. RELATED EXPENSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TECHNICAL

SUPPORT PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS BY 3M LABORATORIES AND

INTERNALLY DEVELOPED PATENT COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE

COSTS AND FEES INCURRED

TO PREPARE, FILE, SECURE AND MAINTAIN PATENTS.

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE.

THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES DIRECT COSTS OF MATERIALS

AND SERVICES USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE. AMOUNTS

CAPITALIZED ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A PERIOD OF THREE TO

FIVE YEARS AND ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT WITHIN

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

ENVIRONMENTAL.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXISTING CONDITIONS CAUSED BY

PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE REVENUES ARE

EXPENSED. LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED ON

42

AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE,

GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS

COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR

CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE OPERATIONS GENERALLY ARE

CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.

INCOME TAXES.

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED

USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY APPROACH. UNDER THIS APPROACH, DEFERRED INCOME

TAXES REPRESENT THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE

COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THEIR RELIABILITY EXISTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, NO

VALUATION ALLOWANCES WERE RECORDED.

EARNINGS PER SHARE.

THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR CALCULATING BASIC

AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DILUTION ASSOCIATED WITH

THE COMPANYS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. CERTAIN MANAGEMENT STOCK

OWNERSHIP PROGRAM AVERAGE OPTIONS OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEARS 2005, 2004 AND

2003 WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BECAUSE

THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A DILUTIVE EFFECT (15.4 MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR

2005, 6.6 MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR 2004 AND 6.4 MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR

2003). AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 8 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, T

HE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES HAVE NEVER BEEN MET; ACCORDINGLY, THERE WAS NO

IMPACT ON 3MS DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE. IF THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE

MET, 3M MAY CHOOSE TO PAY IN CASH AND/OR COMMON STOCK

; HOWEVER, IF THIS

OCCURS, THE COMPANY HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO SETTLE THIS DEBT SECURITY IN

CASH. THE COMPUTATIONS FOR BASIC AND

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31 FOLLOW.

NO. 25, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES, AND GENERALLY NO

COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED FOR EITHER THE GENERAL EMPLOYEES STOCK

PURCHASE PLAN (GESPP) OR THE MANAGEMENT STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM (MSOP). THE

GESPP IS CONSIDERED NON-COMPENSATORY. IN DECEMBER 2002, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

(SFAS) NO. 148, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION



TRANSITION AND DISCLOSURE



AN AMENDMENT OF SFAS NO. 123. THE

COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS NO. 148. REFER TO NOTES

13 AND 14 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THE GESPP AND MSOP AND ALSO

REFER TO ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION LATER IN NOTE 1 CONCERNING THE IMPACT OF SFAS

NO. 123R SHARE BASED PAYMENT. PRO FORMA AMOUNTS FOR STOCK OPTION AWARDS ARE

BASED ON THE OPTIONS ESTIMATED BLACK-SCHOLES FAIR VALUE AT THE DATE OF GRANT,

NET OF TAX, WITH EXPENSE RECOGNITION OVER THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION AWARD.  EFFECTIVE WITH THE

MAY 2005 ANNUAL MSOP GRANT, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS VESTING PERIOD FROM ONE TO

THREE YEARS, WHICH RESULTS IN COMPENSATION EXPENSE UNDER THE MAY 2005 ANNUAL

GRANT BEING RECOGNIZED OVER THREE YEARS. THE DECREASE IN PRO FORMA STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION FOR 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THIS CHANGE IN

VESTING PERIOD. SHARES USED IN THE PRO FORMA DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

COMPUTATION USE THE CALCULATION METHODOLOGY PRESCRIBED BY SFAS NO. 123,

AND ARE THUS DIFFERENT FROM THE SHARES USED FOR THE REPORTED DILUTED EARNINGS

PER SHARE COMPUTATION. PRO FORMA AMOUNTS FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION ARE AS

AND 2003, WERE RECOGNIZED OVER THE NOMINAL VESTING PERIOD, WHEREBY IF AN

EMPLOYEE RETIRED BEFORE THE END OF THE VESTING PERIOD, THE COMPANY WOULD

RECOGNIZE ANY REMAINING UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST AT THE DATE OF

RETIREMENT. SFAS NO. 123R REQUIRES RECOGNITION UNDER A NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING

PERIOD APPROACH, REQUIRING COMPENSATION EXPENSE RECOGNITION WHEN AN EMPLOYEE IS

ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE. 3M EMPLOYEES IN THE U.S. ARE ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE BEGINNING

AT AGE 55 AND AFTER HAVING COMPLETED FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE. APPROXIMATELY 25 TO

30% OF THE NUMBER OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS ARE MADE TO THIS

POPULATION. THE COMPANY WILL CHANGE TO THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING PERIOD

APPROACH FOR NEW STOCK COMPENSATION GRANTS MADE AFTER THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO. 123R ON JANUARY 1, 2006. THEREFORE, PRIMARILY BEGINNING IN MAY 2006

WITH THE ANNUAL MSOP GRANT, IMMEDIATE EXPENSING OF THOSE STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE WILL RESULT IN A

HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAN HISTORICALLY RECOGNIZED IN COMPARABLE PRIOR

PERIODS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE ADJUSTS PRO FORMA DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FROM

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND THE COMPONENTS OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IS COMPOSED OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION EFFECTS (INCLUDING HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL

COMPANIES), MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENTS, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES ON CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

A

LL

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE C

OMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS,

AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY MARKET VOLATILITY. ALL

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE DESIGNATED AND

EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. IF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION CEASES TO EXIST, ALL CHANGES

IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED ARE

RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. INSTRUMENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE

ACCOUNTING ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH CHANGES RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING

PURPOSES AND IS NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES.

HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY DOES HAVE CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT THAT, IF CONDITIONS FOR

CONVERSION ARE MET, IS CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK (REFER TO

NOTE 8 IN THIS DOCUMENT).

44

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED

FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 47, ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS (FIN 47).  THIS ACCOUNTING

STANDARD APPLIES TO THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND

WHERE THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS EXIST FOR CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUE

OF THESE OBLIGATIONS IS RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS.  OVER TIME THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR

THE CHANGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE AND THE INITIAL CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE

DEPRECIATED OVER THE USEFUL LIVES OF THE RELATED ASSETS.  THE ADOPTION OF FIN 47 EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31,

2005, RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION LIABILITY

OF $59 MILLION AND AN AFTER TAX CHARGE OF $35 MILLION, WHICH IS REFLECTED AS A

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE PRO FORMA EFFECT OF APPLYING THIS GUIDANCE IN ALL

PRIOR PERIODS PRESENTED WAS DETERMINED NOT TO BE MATERIAL.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004). SFAS NO.

123R SUPERSEDES APB OPINION NO. 25.

UNDER APB OPINION NO. 25, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED FOR

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION GRANTS IF THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTION

GRANTS IS AT OR ABOVE THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK ON THE DATE

OF GRANT. SFAS NO. 123R REQUIRES THE DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AT THE GRANT DATE AND THE RECOGNITION OF THE RELATED

EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION VESTS. THE

ORIGINAL EFFECTIVE DATE FOR SFAS NO. 123R FOR THE COMPANY WAS JULY 1, 2005.

HOWEVER, ON APRIL 14, 2005, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC)

ADOPTED A NEW RULE THAT AMENDS THE EFFECTIVE DATES FOR SFAS NO. 123R.  THE SECS NEW RULE ALLOWS COMPANIES TO

IMPLEMENT SFAS NO. 123R AT THE BEGINNING OF THEIR NEXT FISCAL YEAR, INSTEAD OF

THE NEXT REPORTING PERIOD, THAT BEGINS AFTER JUNE 15, 2005. THEREFORE, THE

COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123R EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006. THE COMPANY IS

ADOPTING SFAS NO. 123R USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. ALL PRIOR

PERIODS WILL BE ADJUSTED TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE FAIR-VALUE-BASED METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1,

1995. THE 2006 IMPACT OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 123R IS ESTIMATED TO BE

APPROXIMATELY $.16 PER DILUTED SHARE, WHICH REFLECTS EXPENSE FOR BOTH THE GESPP

AND MSOP.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP)

NO. 109-2, ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE FOR THE FOREIGN EARNINGS

REPATRIATION PROVISION WITHIN THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004, WHICH

PROVIDES GUIDANCE UNDER SFAS NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, WITH

RESPECT TO RECORDING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE REPATRIATION PROVISIONS OF THE

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE JOBS ACT) ON ENTERPRISES INCOME TAX

EXPENSE AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY. THE JOBS ACT WAS ENACTED ON

OCTOBER 22, 2004. THE JOBS ACT CREATES A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S.

CORPORATIONS TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED INCOME EARNED ABROAD BY PROVIDING AN 85%

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION FOR CERTAIN DIVIDENDS FROM CONTROLLED FOREIGN

CORPORATIONS. FSP NO. 109-2 STATES THAT AN ENTERPRISE IS ALLOWED TIME BEYOND

THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PERIOD OF ENACTMENT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT OF THE JOBS

ACT ON ITS PLAN FOR REINVESTMENT OR REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR

PURPOSES OF APPLYING SFAS NO. 109. DURING 2005, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS

EVALUATION OF THE REPATRIATION PROVISION AND, IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005,

RECOGNIZED $75 MILLION, NET OF AVAILABLE FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, OF RELATED TAX

LIABILITY AS A RESULT OF ITS REPATRIATION PLAN. IN 2005, THE COMPANY

REPATRIATED APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS INTO THE UNITED

STATES PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE JOBS ACT.

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE FASBS EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE FINALIZED EITF

ISSUE NO. 04-08, THE EFFECT OF CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT ON DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE THAT WOULD REQUIRE THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF SHARES FROM

CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT TO BE INCLUDED IN THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE

CALCULATION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE CONTINGENCY HAS BEEN MET. THE COMPANY HAS

$616 MILLION IN AGGREGATE FACE AMOUNT OF 30-YEAR ZERO COUPON SENIOR NOTES THAT

ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO APPROXIMATELY 5.8 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IF

CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET. THESE CONDITIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN MET (SEE NOTE 8).

IN SEPTEMBER 2005, THE FASB REVISED ITS DECEMBER 2003 EXPOSURE DRAFT SFAS NO.

128R, 

EARNINGS PER

SHARE  AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 128 ANTICIPATED TO BE

EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER JUNE 15, 2006.  THE PROPOSED SFAS NO. 128R FURTHER ADDRESSES

CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT AND SEVERAL OTHER ISSUES. UNLESS THE COMPANY

TAKES STEPS TO MODIFY CERTAIN TERMS OF THIS DEBT SECURITY, EITF ISSUE NO. 04-08

AND PROPOSED SFAS NO. 128R (WHEN EFFECTIVE) WOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF

APPROXIMATELY 5.8 MILLION SHARES TO DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING TO GIVE EFFECT

TO THE CONTINGENT ISSUANCE OF SHARES. ALSO, USING THE IF-CONVERTED METHOD, NET

INCOME FOR THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS WOULD BE ADJUSTED FOR

INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DEBT INSTRUMENT. EITF ISSUE NO. 04-08

WOULD HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE BEGINNING WITH THE COMPANYS 2004 FOURTH QUARTER.

HOWEVER, DUE TO THE FASBS DELAY IN ISSUING SFAS NO. 128R AND THE COMPANYS

INTENT AND ABILITY TO SETTLE THIS DEBT SECURITY IN CASH VERSUS THE ISSUANCE OF

STOCK, THE IMPACT OF THE ADDITIONAL DILUTED SHARES WILL NOT BE INCLUDED IN THE

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION UNTIL THE PROPOSED SFAS NO. 128R IS

EFFECTIVE. WHEN SFAS NO. 128R IS EFFECTIVE, PRIOR PERIODS DILUTED SHARES

OUTSTANDING AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AMOUNTS WILL BE RESTATED TO PRESENT

COMPARABLE INFORMATION. THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL REDUCTION IN THE COMPANYS DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $.02 TO $.03 PER SHARE FOR

TOTAL YEAR 2005, 2004 AND 2003. BECAUSE THE IMPACT OF THIS STANDARD IS ONGOING,

THE COMPANYS

45

DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AMOUNTS WOULD

BE IMPACTED UNTIL RETIREMENT OR MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN TERMS OF THIS DEBT

SECURITY.

THE MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY

ADJUSTMENT IS CALCULATED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IF THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION (ABO) EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF PENSION ASSETS, THE EMPLOYER MUST

RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY THAT IS AT LEAST EQUAL TO THE UNFUNDED ABO.

FOR

THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE CHANGE FROM A MINIMUM PENSION

LIABILITY WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO A PREPAID PENSION

ASSET INCREASED STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY BY $1.193 BILLION (AFTER-TAX).

51

THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE

ASSETS BEING IN EXCESS OF THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR THE U.S.

QUALIFIED PLAN, WHICH CAUSED THE MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY RECORDED FOR THE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002 TO BE REVERSED.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY REMAINED IN A PREPAID

ASSET POSITION FOR ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PLAN.

INCOME TAX EFFECTS FOR

CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE NO TAX PROVISION HAS BEEN

MADE FOR THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTO U.S.

DOLLARS. RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE TO AVOID DOUBLE COUNTING IN

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS THAT ARE ALSO RECORDED AS PART OF NET INCOME.

RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS (OTHER THAN FOR CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

PROVIDED IN NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) WERE NOT MATERIAL.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY RECORDED $75 MILLION OF

INCOME TAX PROVISION, NET OF AVAILABLE FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, RELATED TO THE

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE JOBS ACT), WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

THE 2005 EFFECTIVE WORLDWIDE TAX RATE BY 1.5%.

THE COMPANY MADE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS

TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN OF $200 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND $300 MILLION FOR THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2005.

IN THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, THE COMPANY MADE A SPECIAL PENSION

CONTRIBUTION TO 3MS JAPANESE PENSION PLAN OF $155 MILLION AND A DISCRETIONARY

CONTRIBUTION OF $300 MILLION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2003, 3M MADE A DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION OF $600 MILLION TO ITS

U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN.

THE CURRENT INCOME TAX PROVISION INCLUDES A BENEFIT FOR THE PENSION

CONTRIBUTIONS; THE DEFERRED TAX PROVISION INCLUDES A COST FOR THE RELATED

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE. ALSO IN 2004, THE COMPANY REVERSED A MAJORITY OF THE

MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY, WHICH WAS INITIALLY RECORDED IN 2002. THE CHANGE IN

THE 2004 YEAR-END DEFERRED TAX BALANCE INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF REVERSING THIS

MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY IN ADDITION TO THE ANNUAL PROVISION FOR DEFERRED

INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

ANNUAL

TAX PROVISIONS INCLUDE AMOUNTS CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT TO PAY ASSESSMENTS THAT

MAY RESULT FROM EXAMINATION OF TAX RETURNS; HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT ULTIMATELY PAID

UPON RESOLUTION OF ISSUES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE AMOUNT ACCRUED.

AS A

RESULT OF CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT COMMITMENTS AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MADE BY 3M,

INCOME FROM MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES IS SUBJECT TO REDUCED

TAX RATES OR, IN SOME CASES, IS EXEMPT FROM TAX FOR YEARS THROUGH 2012. THE

INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TAX STATUS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE

ESTIMATED TO BE $23 MILLION (3 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2005, $32 MILLION

(4 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2004 AND $34 MILLION (4 CENTS PER DILUTED

SHARE) IN 2003.

THE COMPANY HAS NOT PROVIDED DEFERRED TAXES

ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN

CONSIDERED TO BE REINVESTED INDEFINITELY.

THESE EARNINGS RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS AND WERE APPROXIMATELY $3.5

BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005.  BECAUSE

OF THE AVAILABILITY OF U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO

DETERMINE THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE

NOT REINVESTED.  DEFERRED TAXES ARE

PROVIDED FOR ESTIMATED U.S. AND FOREIGN INCOMES TAXES, LESS AVAILABLE TAX

CREDITS AND DEDUCTIONS, WHICH MAY BE INCURRED ON THE REMITTANCE OF THE COMPANYS

SHARE OF SUBSIDIARIES UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS NOT DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY

REINVESTED.

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF

2004.

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE JOBS ACT). THE JOBS ACT PROVIDES A

DEDUCTION FOR INCOME FROM QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WHICH WILL

BE PHASED IN FROM 2005 THROUGH 2010. IN RETURN, THE ACT ALSO PROVIDES FOR A

TWO-YEAR PHASE-OUT OF THE EXISTING EXTRA-TERRITORIAL INCOME EXCLUSION (ETI) FOR

FOREIGN SALES THAT WAS VIEWED TO BE INCONSISTENT WITH INTERNATIONAL TRADE

PROTOCOLS BY THE EUROPEAN UNION. UNCERTAINTY REMAINS AS TO HOW TO INTERPRET

NUMEROUS PROVISIONS IN THE JOBS ACT. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT

THE NET EFFECT OF THE PHASE-OUT OF THE ETI AND THE PHASE-IN OF THIS NEW

DEDUCTION TO MATERIALLY IMPACT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2006.

THE JOBS ACT CREATED A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE

FOR U.S. CORPORATIONS TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED INCOME EARNED ABROAD BY

PROVIDING AN 85% DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION FOR CERTAIN DIVIDENDS FROM

CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATIONS. THIS PROVIDED 3M THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAX

EFFECTIVELY REPATRIATE FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR U.S. QUALIFYING INVESTMENTS

SPECIFIED BY 3MS DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN.

DURING 2005, THE

COMPANY COMPLETED ITS EVALUATION OF THE REPATRIATION PROVISION AND, IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2005, RECOGNIZED $75 MILLION, NET OF AVAILABLE FOREIGN TAX

CREDITS, OF RELATED TAX LIABILITY AS A RESULT OF ITS REPATRIATION PLAN. IN

2005, THE COMPANY REPATRIATED APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS IN

THE UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE JOBS ACT.

REMARKETABLE SECURITIES (FINAL MATURITY 2010) AND $62 MILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM

NOTES (FINAL MATURITY 2044). THESE SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION

OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS THE RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS. THE NEXT DATE ON WHICH INVESTORS CAN REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO

REPURCHASE THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES IS 2007, THUS IN THE ABOVE SCHEDULE THESE

SECURITIES ARE CONSIDERED DUE IN 2007 (FINAL MATURITY 2032).

THE ESOP DEBT IS SERVICED BY DIVIDENDS ON STOCK HELD BY THE ESOP AND BY

COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT REPORTED AS INTEREST

EXPENSE, BUT ARE REPORTED AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME. OTHER BORROWINGS INCLUDES DEBT HELD BY 3MS INTERNATIONAL

COMPANIES AND FLOATING RATE NOTES IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH THE LONG-TERM

PORTION OF THIS DEBT PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF U.S. DOLLAR FLOATING RATE DEBT. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2005, AVAILABLE SHORT-TERM COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT GLOBALLY

TOTALED ABOUT $618 MILLION, OF WHICH $101 MILLION WAS UTILIZED. DEBT COVENANTS

DO NOT RESTRICT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

3M HAS

A MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM AND SHELF REGISTRATION THAT HAVE REMAINING CAPACITY

OF APPROXIMATELY $1.438 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. IN SEPTEMBER 2003, THE

COMPANY FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION RELATING TO THE POTENTIAL OFFERING OF DEBT SECURITIES OF UP TO $1.5

BILLION. THIS SHELF REGISTRATION BECAME EFFECTIVE IN OCTOBER 2003. IN DECEMBER

2003, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE SHELF A MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM

THROUGH WHICH UP TO $1.5 BILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MAY BE OFFERED. 3M PLANS

TO USE THE NET PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF DEBT SECURITIES UNDER THIS

REGISTRATION FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT;

INVESTMENTS IN OR EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO 3M SUBSIDIARIES; OR THE FINANCING OF

POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS OR BUSINESS EXPANSION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, $62 MILLION

OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES HAD BEEN ISSUED UNDER THE MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM. NO

DEBT WAS ISSUED UNDER THIS PROGRAM IN 2005.

3M MAY REDEEM ITS 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES (THE CONVERTIBLE

NOTES) AT ANY TIME IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BEGINNING NOVEMBER 21, 2007, AT THE

ACCRETED CONVERSION PRICE; HOWEVER, BONDHOLDERS MAY CONVERT UPON NOTIFICATION

OF REDEMPTION INTO 9.4602 SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK. HOLDERS OF THE 30-YEAR

ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES HAVE THE OPTION TO REQUIRE 3M TO PURCHASE THEIR NOTES

AT ACCRETED VALUE ON NOVEMBER 21 IN THE YEARS 2005, 2007, 2012, 2017, 2022 AND

2027. IN NOVEMBER 2005, 22,506 OF THE 639,000 IN OUTSTANDING BONDS WERE

REDEEMED, RESULTING IN A PAYOUT FROM 3M OF APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION. THIS

REDUCED THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES FACE VALUE AT MATURITY TO $616 MILLION, WHICH

EQUATES TO A BOOK VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $539 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. AS

DISCLOSED IN A FORM 8-K IN NOVEMBER 2005, 3M AMENDED THE TERMS OF THESE

SECURITIES TO PAY CASH AT A RATE OF 2.40% PER ANNUM OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AT

MATURITY OF THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES, WHICH EQUATES TO 2.75% PER ANNUM

OF THE NOTES' ACCRETED VALUE ON NOVEMBER 21, 2005. THE CASH INTEREST

PAYMENTS WILL BE MADE SEMIANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON MAY 22, 2006, NOVEMBER 22,

2006, MAY 22, 2007 AND NOVEMBER 22, 2007 TO HOLDERS OF RECORD ON THE 15TH

CALENDAR DAY PRECEDING EACH SUCH INTEREST PAYMENT DATE.

3M ORIGINALLY SOLD $639 MILLION IN AGGREGATE FACE AMOUNT OF THESE CONVERTIBLE

NOTES ON NOVEMBER 15, 2002, WHICH ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF 3M COMMON

STOCK. THE GROSS PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING, TO BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE

PURPOSES, WERE $550 MILLION ($540 MILLION NET OF ISSUANCE COSTS). DEBT ISSUANCE

COSTS WERE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A THREE-YEAR PERIOD

BEGINNING IN NOVEMBER 2002. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2003, 3M REGISTERED THESE

CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN A REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THE TERMS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES INCLUDE A YIELD TO

MATURITY OF .50% AND AN INITIAL CONVERSION PREMIUM OF 40% OVER THE $65.00

(SPLIT-ADJUSTED) CLOSING PRICE OF 3M COMMON STOCK ON NOVEMBER 14, 2002. IF

CERTAIN CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION (RELATING TO THE CLOSING COMMON STOCK PRICES

OF 3M EXCEEDING THE CONVERSION TRIGGER PRICE FOR SPECIFIED PERIODS) ARE MET,

HOLDERS MAY CONVERT EACH OF THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES INTO 9.4602

SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK IN ANY CALENDAR QUARTER COMMENCING AFTER MARCH 31,

2003. THE CONVERSION TRIGGER PRICE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005 WAS $120.00

PER SHARE. IF THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, AND 3M ELECTS NOT TO

SETTLE IN CASH, THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE IN THE

AGGREGATE INTO APPROXIMATELY 5.8 MILLION SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK. 3M MAY

CHOOSE TO PAY THE REDEMPTION PURCHASE PRICE IN CASH AND/OR COMMON STOCK;

HOWEVER, IF REDEMPTION OCCURS, THE COMPANY HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO SETTLE

THIS DEBT SECURITY IN CASH. THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION HAVE NEVER BEEN MET;

ACCORDINGLY, THERE HAS BEEN NO IMPACT ON 3MS DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE. FOR A

DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT WILL AFFECT ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

FOR THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE, REFER TO NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR DISCUSSION OF EITF ISSUE NO. 04-08, THE EFFECT OF

CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT ON DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND PROPOSED SFAS

NO. 128R, EARNINGS PER SHARE.

55

IN DECEMBER 2005, THE COMPANYS $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE

SECURITIES WERE REMARKETED FOR ONE YEAR. THEY WERE REISSUED WITH A FIXED COUPON

RATE OF 5.65%. THESE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION

OF LONG-TERM DEBT, WERE ISSUED IN DECEMBER 2000. THE REMARKETABLE SECURITIES

CAN BE REMARKETED ANNUALLY, AT THE OPTION OF THE DEALER, FOR A YEAR EACH TIME,

WITH A FINAL MATURITY DATE OF DECEMBER 2010.

NOTE 9.  DERIVATIVES AND OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY

USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS, AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO

MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, INTEREST RATE AND

COMMODITY MARKET VOLATILITY. THE INFORMATION THAT FOLLOWS EXPLAINS THE VARIOUS

TYPES OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND INCLUDES A TABLE THAT

RECAPS CASH FLOW HEDGING AMOUNTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD

CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAPS TO HEDGE AGAINST THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN

INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW

HEDGES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD VARIOUS OPEN FOREIGN EXCHANGE

FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAD MATURITIES OF ONE YEAR

OR LESS. THE AMOUNTS AT RISK ARE NOT MATERIAL BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS THE

ABILITY TO GENERATE OFFSETTING FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS. THE SETTLEMENT OR

EXTENSION OF THESE DERIVATIVES WILL RESULT IN RECLASSIFICATIONS TO EARNINGS IN

THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS (FROM OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME). THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH 3M IS HEDGING ITS

EXPOSURE TO THE VARIABILITY IN FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR A MAJORITY OF THE

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, EXCLUDING THOSE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO THE

PAYMENT OF VARIABLE INTEREST ON EXISTING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, IS 12 MONTHS.

BASED ON EXCHANGE RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECLASSIFY

TO EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS A MAJORITY OF THE CASH FLOW HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS AFTER-TAX GAIN OF

$38

MILLION (WITH THE IMPACT LARGELY OFFSET BY FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS FROM

UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEMS).  HEDGE

INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS 2005, 2004 AND 2003.

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES INTEREST EXPENSE USING A MIX

OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATE DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE BORROWING COSTS, THE COMPANY

MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY

AGREES TO EXCHANGE, AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND

FLOATING INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AN AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS TO MANAGE

INTEREST RATE RISK RELATED TO BORROWINGS.

AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, THE COMPANY DID NOT HAVE ANY INTEREST RATE SWAPS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE

HEDGES OF UNDERLYING FIXED RATE OBLIGATIONS. THE FAIR VALUE OF SWAPS AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004 WAS $3 MILLION. THE MARK-TO-MARKET OF THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES

IS RECORDED AS GAINS OR LOSSES IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND IS OFFSET BY THE GAIN OR

LOSS ON THE UNDERLYING DEBT INSTRUMENT, WHICH ALSO IS RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE.

THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE 100% EFFECTIVE AND, THUS, THERE IS NO IMPACT ON

EARNINGS DUE TO HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS.

AS CIRCUMSTANCES

WARRANT, THE COMPANY ALSO USES CROSS-CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO HEDGE

FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES. AS PART OF THIS STRATEGY, IN SEPTEMBER 2003, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A

THREE-YEAR COMBINED INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAP WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF

$300 MILLION. THIS TRANSACTION IS A PARTIAL HEDGE OF 3MS NET INVESTMENT IN 3MS

JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THIS SWAP CONVERTS A VARIABLE RATE U.S. DOLLAR EXPOSURE

TO A VARIABLE RATE YEN-DENOMINATED EXPOSURE.

56

NET INVESTMENT HEDGING.

AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT AND

FORWARDS TO HEDGE PORTIONS OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN

OPERATIONS. FOR HEDGES THAT MEET THE EFFECTIVENESS REQUIREMENTS, THE NET GAINS

OR LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME, WITH ANY INEFFECTIVENESS RECORDED IN COST OF SALES. THE UNREALIZED GAIN

RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 WAS $47 MILLION AND THE

UNREALIZED GAIN AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 WAS $5 MILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, THIS

AMOUNT WAS NOT MATERIAL. HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2005, 2004

AND 2003.

COMMODITY PRICE MANAGEMENT.

THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH

NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL

CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY USES COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS TO MANAGE PRICE VOLATILITY. THE RELATED MARK-TO-MARKET GAIN OR

LOSS ON QUALIFYING HEDGES IS INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO THE

EXTENT EFFECTIVE (TYPICALLY 100% EFFECTIVE), AND RECLASSIFIED INTO COST OF

SALES IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. 3M

HAS HEDGED ITS EXPOSURE TO THE VARIABILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR CERTAIN

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS THROUGH 2008. NO SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY CASH FLOW HEDGES

WERE DISCONTINUED DURING THE YEARS 2005, 2004 AND 2003.

CURRENCY

EFFECTS.

3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR CURRENCY

EFFECTS, INCLUDING HEDGING IMPACTS, INCREASED NET INCOME BY $115 MILLION IN

2005, $181 MILLION IN 2004, AND $73 MILLION IN 2003. THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES THE

EFFECT OF TRANSLATING PROFITS FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS; THE

IMPACT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF GOODS BETWEEN 3M OPERATIONS

IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD; AND TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISKS.

3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTION GAINS AND

LOSSES INCREASED NET INCOME BY $50 MILLION IN 2005 AND $48 MILLION IN 2004. 3M

ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES DECREASED

NET INCOME BY $73 MILLION IN 2003.

CREDIT RISK.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE

EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES IN INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY

SWAPS, AND OPTION AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS RISK

IS LIMITED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MONITORS

ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH THE USE OF CREDIT APPROVALS AND CREDIT

LIMITS, AND BY SELECTING MAJOR INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS

AS COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY OF

THESE COUNTERPARTIES.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2005

AND 2004, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, BORROWINGS,

AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS,

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT

PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT (EXCEPT THE $350 MILLION DEALER REMARKETABLE

SECURITY) APPROXIMATED CARRYING VALUES BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF

THESE INSTRUMENTS. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE

REPORTED AT FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUES FOR INVESTMENTS HELD AT COST ARE NOT

READILY AVAILABLE, BUT ARE ESTIMATED TO APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE. THE CARRYING

AMOUNTS AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS BASED ON

NOTE 10.  PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

3M HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

PENSION BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANS GENERALLY ARE BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANTS

YEARS OF SERVICE, COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IN

ADDITION TO PROVIDING PENSION BENEFITS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES CERTAIN

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF

ITS U.S. EMPLOYEES WHO REACH RETIREMENT AGE WHILE EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. MOST

INTERNATIONAL EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES ARE COVERED BY GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE

PROGRAMS. THE COST OF COMPANY-PROVIDED POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE PLANS FOR

INTERNATIONAL EMPLOYEES IS NOT MATERIAL AND IS COMBINED WITH U.S. AMOUNTS.

THE COMPANYS PENSION FUNDING POLICY IS TO DEPOSIT WITH INDEPENDENT

TRUSTEES AMOUNTS ALLOWABLE BY LAW. TRUST FUNDS AND DEPOSITS WITH INSURANCE

COMPANIES ARE MAINTAINED TO PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND

THEIR BENEFICIARIES. THERE ARE NO PLAN ASSETS IN THE NON-QUALIFIED PLAN DUE TO

ITS NATURE. FOR ITS U.S. POSTRETIREMENT PLAN, THE COMPANY HAS SET ASIDE AMOUNTS

AT LEAST EQUAL TO ANNUAL BENEFIT PAYMENTS WITH AN INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE.

57

ON DECEMBER 8,

2003, THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003

(THE MEDICARE ACT) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE ACT EXPANDS MEDICARE TO INCLUDE

COVERAGE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. 3M SPONSORS MEDICAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FOR U.S. RETIREES. ON MAY 19, 2004, THE FASB ISSUED

FSP NO. 106-2, ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE MEDICARE

PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003, WHICH REQUIRES

CURRENT RECOGNITION OF THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY THAT EMPLOYERS MAY RECEIVE FOR

PROVIDING DRUG COVERAGE TO RETIREES. FSP NO. 106-2 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR THE

COMPANY JULY 1, 2004. THE COMPANY REMEASURED ITS PLANS ASSETS AND ACCUMULATED

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION (APBO) AS OF JUNE 30, 2004 TO INCLUDE THE

EFFECTS OF THE MEDICARE ACT. THE MEDICARE ACT REDUCED THE APBO BY $240 MILLION,

WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE TO THE APBO OF $170 MILLION AS A

RESULT OF THE PLAN REMEASUREMENT. THE NET IMPACT TO THE APBO WAS A REDUCTION OF

$70 MILLION.

IN 2004, THE COMPANYS U.S. PLAN MEASUREMENT DATE WAS CHANGED FROM

SEPTEMBER 30 TO DECEMBER 31. INFORMATION PRESENTED IN THE TABLES FOR U.S. PLANS

FOR 2005 AND 2004 REFLECTS A MEASUREMENT DATE OF DECEMBER 31, AND FOR 2003 A

MEASUREMENT DATE OF SEPTEMBER 30. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THIS CHANGE INCLUDE

CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL MEASUREMENT DATES, THE INCREASED

CLARITY THAT RESULTS FROM HAVING THE SAME MEASUREMENT AND BALANCE SHEET DATES,

AND ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION. THIS CHANGE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON THE DETERMINATION OF PERIODIC PENSION COST OR PENSION OBLIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF CUNO DURING THE THIRD QUARTER

OF 2005. CUNO HAS SEVERAL U.S. PLANS AND AN INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLAN. THE

U.S. PLANS HAD A COMBINED PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF $53 MILLION AND PLAN

ASSETS OF $42 MILLION AS OF AUGUST 1, 2005. THE INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLAN HAD

A PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF $13 MILLION AND PLAN ASSETS OF $10 MILLION AS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY CONVERTED TO THE RP (RETIREMENT

PLANS) 2000 MORTALITY TABLE FOR CALCULATING THE YEAR-END 2005 U.S. PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND 2006 EXPENSE. THE IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE

INCREASED THE YEAR-END 2005 U.S. PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR PENSION BY

$385 MILLION, THE YEAR-END 2005 U.S. ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR

PENSION BY $349 MILLION AND THE 2005 U.S. ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

OBLIGATION BY $93 MILLION.  THIS CHANGE

WILL ALSO INCREASE PENSION EXPENSES FOR 2006 BY $64 MILLION AND POSTRETIREMENT

EXPENSES BY $17 MILLION.

THE COMPANY REVIEWS EXTERNAL DATA AND ITS OWN HISTORICAL TRENDS FOR

HEALTH CARE COSTS TO DETERMINE THE HEALTH CARE TREND RATES FOR THE

POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS. IN 2006, THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE TREND RATE WILL

CONTINUE ON THE CURRENT TREND TO A RATE OF 8.0% DECLINING TO AN ULTIMATE TREND

RATE OF 5.0% IN 3 YEARS.  ASSUMED HEALTH

CARE TREND RATES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR THE

HEALTH CARE PLANS. A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN ASSUMED HEALTH COST TREND

RATES WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECTS.

3MS INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IS TO

MANAGE THE PLANS ON A GOING-CONCERN BASIS. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE FUNDS IS TO

MEET THE OBLIGATIONS AS REQUIRED. THE SECONDARY GOAL IS TO EARN THE HIGHEST

RATE OF RETURN POSSIBLE, WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING ITS PRIMARY GOAL, AND WITHOUT

SUBJECTING THE COMPANY TO AN UNDUE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTION RATE VOLATILITY. FUND

RETURNS ARE USED TO HELP FINANCE PRESENT AND FUTURE OBLIGATIONS TO THE EXTENT

POSSIBLE WITHIN ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED FUNDING LIMITS AND TAX-DETERMINED ASSET

LIMITS, THUS REDUCING THE LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTIONS 3M MUST MAKE.

3M DOES NOT BUY OR SELL ANY OF ITS OWN STOCK AS A DIRECT INVESTMENT FOR

ITS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT FUNDS. HOWEVER, DUE TO EXTERNAL

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT OF THE FUNDS, THE PLANS MAY INDIRECTLY BUY, SELL OR HOLD

3M STOCK. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE SHARES WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE

MATERIAL RELATIVE TO THE AGGREGATE FUND PERCENTAGES.

FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.75% IN 2005. PROJECTED RETURNS ARE BASED PRIMARILY

ON BROAD, PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY AND FIXED-INCOME INDICES AND FORWARD-LOOKING

ESTIMATES OF ACTIVE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANYS EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON AN ASSET ALLOCATION ASSUMPTION

OF 44% U.S. AND 15% INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, WITH AN EXPECTED

61

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF 7.8% FOR BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

EQUITIES; 13% PRIVATE EQUITIES WITH AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF

12.8%; 28% FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES WITH AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF

4.5%; AND AN ADDITIONAL RATE OF RETURN OF 1.3% FROM ACTIVE INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSUMPTIONS RESULT IN AN 8.75% EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON AN

ANNUALIZED BASIS. THE PLAN ASSETS EARNED A RATE OF RETURN IN EXCESS OF 10%, 13%

AND 18% IN 2005, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY. THE AVERAGE ANNUAL ACTUAL RETURN

ON THE PLAN ASSETS OVER THE PAST 10 AND 25 YEARS HAS BEEN 10.2% AND 12.2%,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE PRECEDING ASSET ALLOCATIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL PLANS REPRESENT THE

TOP SIX COUNTRIES BY PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION. THESE COUNTRIES REPRESENT

APPROXIMATELY 90% OF THE TOTAL PROJECTED INTERNATIONAL BENEFIT OBLIGATION. THE

OTHER COUNTRIES ASSET ALLOCATIONS WOULD NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

INFORMATION PRESENTED.

IN 2005, THE

COMPANY MADE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $500 MILLION TO ITS U.S.

QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN, WITH $200 MILLION CONTRIBUTED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2005, AND $300 MILLION CONTRIBUTED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005. IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2005, THE COMPANY ALSO TRANSFERRED A PORTION OF ITS SUMITOMO 3M

JAPANESE PENSION LIABILITIES AND ASSETS TO THE GOVERNMENT, AS ALLOWED BY A

JAPANESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWED 3M TO

62

TRANSFER $145

MILLION IN PENSION LIABILITIES AND $74 MILLION IN PENSION ASSETS TO THE

JAPANESE GOVERNMENT.  THE COMPANY

REMEASURED ITS PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION AND PLAN ASSETS AS OF AUGUST 15,

2005, TO INCLUDE THE EFFECT OF THIS TRANSFER. AS A RESULT OF THE REMEASUREMENT,

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A GAIN OF $8 MILLION. THE GAIN PARTIALLY OFFSETS THE

2005 NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST.

IN 2006, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE AN AMOUNT IN THE RANGE OF

$100 MILLION TO $400 MILLION TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, AND

APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION TO ITS POST-RETIREMENT PLANS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

HAVE A REQUIRED MINIMUM PENSION CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN

2006. THEREFORE, THE AMOUNT OF THE ANTICIPATED DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION COULD

VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE U.S. PLANS FUNDING STATUS AS OF THE 2006

MEASUREMENT DATE AND THE ANTICIPATED TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE CONTRIBUTION.

RENTAL EXPENSE UNDER OPERATING LEASES WAS $195 MILLION IN 2005, $181

MILLION IN 2004 AND $162 MILLION IN 2003. IT IS 3MS PRACTICE TO SECURE RENEWAL

RIGHTS FOR LEASES, THEREBY GIVING 3M THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO

MAINTAIN A PRESENCE IN A LEASED FACILITY. 3MS PRIMARY CAPITAL LEASE, WHICH

BECAME EFFECTIVE IN APRIL 2003, INVOLVES A BUILDING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (WITH

A LEASE TERM OF 22 YEARS). DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, 3M RECORDED A

CAPITAL LEASE ASSET AND OBLIGATION OF APPROXIMATELY 33.5 MILLION UNITED KINGDOM

POUNDS (APPROXIMATELY $58 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 EXCHANGE RATES). MINIMUM

LEASE PAYMENTS UNDER CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES WITH NON-CANCELABLE TERMS IN

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY AND SOME OF ITS

SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS, PRINCIPALLY IN THE

UNITED STATES, AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS WORLDWIDE. THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS

PRODUCTS LIABILITY (INVOLVING PRODUCTS THAT THE COMPANY NOW OR FORMERLY

MANUFACTURED AND SOLD), INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND COMMERCIAL CLAIMS AND

LAWSUITS, INCLUDING THOSE BROUGHT UNDER THE ANTITRUST LAWS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL

PROCEEDINGS. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS FIRST DESCRIBE THE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED, AND THEN DESCRIBE THE LIABILITIES

AND ASSOCIATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES THE COMPANY HAS ACCRUED RELATING TO ITS

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, THE COMPANY IS

VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ALL SUCH LITIGATION.

ANTITRUST LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, LEPAGES INC., A

TRANSPARENT TAPE COMPETITOR OF 3M, FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY IN JUNE

1997 ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN MARKETING PRACTICES OF THE COMPANY CONSTITUTED

UNLAWFUL MONOPOLIZATION UNDER THE ANTITRUST LAWS.

FOLLOWING THE ENTRY OF A VERDICT IN LEPAGES FAVOR AND APPELLATE RULINGS

SUSTAINING THAT VERDICT, DIRECT AND INDIRECT TAPE PURCHASERS FILED A NUMBER OF

PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS AND INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS AGAINST THE COMPANY IN VARIOUS

STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS. THESE CASES ALLEGE THAT THE COMPANY COMPETED UNFAIRLY

AND UNLAWFULLY MONOPOLIZED ALLEGED MARKETS FOR TRANSPARENT TAPE, AND THEY SEEK

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND TO RECOVER ON BEHALF OF VARIOUSLY DEFINED CLASSES OF

DIRECT AND INDIRECT PURCHASERS DAMAGES IN THE FORM OF PRICE OVERCHARGES THE

COMPANY ALLEGEDLY CHARGED FOR THESE PRODUCTS.

INDIRECT PURCHASER ANTITRUST LITIGATION

 IN DECEMBER 2005, THE FEDERAL COURT IN CALIFORNIA GRANTED PRELIMINARY

APPROVAL OF THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT OF TWELVE

TAPE-RELATED CLASS ACTIONS BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF INDIRECT PURCHASERS WHO DID NOT

PURCHASE TAPE FOR RESALE. THE FINAL APPROVAL HEARING IS CURRENTLY SCHEDULED FOR

APRIL 2006. THE COMPANY ALSO ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2005 TO RESOLVE TWO OTHER CASES INVOLVING INDIRECT PURCHASES NOT FOR RESALE

ORIGINALLY BROUGHT AS CLASS ACTIONS IN STATE COURTS IN MASSACHUSETTS AND

FLORIDA. THE COMPLAINTS IN THOSE CASES WERE AMENDED TO REFLECT THE SAME

PRODUCTS AS THOSE IN THE CALIFORNIA FEDERAL CLASS ACTION AND WILL BE DISMISSED

AND THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WILL BE EFFECTIVE ONCE THE SETTLEMENT OF THE

TWELVE CLASS ACTIONS IS GIVEN FINAL COURT APPROVAL AND AFTER SECURING STATE

COURT APPROVAL WHERE NECESSARY.

DIRECT PURCHASER ANTITRUST LITIGATION

 IN

NOVEMBER 2005, THE COMPANY AGREED TO

SETTLE THREE OF THE FOUR PENDING DIRECT PURCHASER TRANSPARENT TAPE ANTITRUST

CASES TWO INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS AND A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION ON BEHALF OF DIRECT

PURCHASERS OF BOTH 3M BRANDED AND PRIVATE LABEL TAPE.  IF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT EXECUTED BY THE

PARTIES TO THE PURPORTED CLASS ACTION RECEIVES FEDERAL COURT APPROVAL AND ALL

CONDITIONS IN THE AGREEMENT ARE SATISFIED, THE SETTLEMENT WILL TERMINATE THE

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION AND RELEASE THE CLAIMS OF THE AFFECTED PUTATIVE CLASS

MEMBERS NATIONWIDE. THE SETTLEMENTS OF THE TWO INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS ARE SUBJECT

TO THE PARTIES SIGNING A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT BUT ARE NOT CONDITIONED ON COURT

APPROVAL. THE PROPOSED CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT DOES NOT AFFECT THE CERTIFIED

CLASS ACTION BROUGHT BY DIRECT PURCHASERS OF 3M TRANSPARENT AND INVISIBLE TAPE

(BUT NOT PRIVATE LABEL TAPE) THAT IS PENDING IN A FEDERAL COURT IN PENNSYLVANIA

AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY ADMISSION OF LIABILITY BY THE COMPANY. THE COURT

HAS SCHEDULED TRIAL OF THAT ACTION TO COMMENCE IN LATE SPRING OF THIS YEAR.

BREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION

THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OTHER COMPANIES WERE NAMED AS

DEFENDANTS IN PAST YEARS IN NUMEROUS CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS ALLEGING DAMAGES FOR

PERSONAL INJURIES OF VARIOUS TYPES RESULTING FROM BREAST IMPLANTS FORMERLY

MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY OR A RELATED COMPANY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CLAIMS

AGAINST THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER ITS

REMAINING PROBABLE LIABILITY TO BE MATERIAL.

INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ASSOCIATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLE AND LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO IT FOLLOWS IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED

BREAST IMPLANT INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS

LITIGATION

FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS, THE

COMPANY HAS DEFENDED AND RESOLVED THE CLAIMS OF OVER 370,000 INDIVIDUAL

CLAIMANTS ALLEGING INJURIES FROM OCCUPATIONAL DUST EXPOSURES. AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2005, THE COMPANY IS A NAMED DEFENDANT, WITH MULTIPLE CO-DEFENDANTS, IN

NUMEROUS LAWSUITS IN VARIOUS COURTS THAT PURPORT TO REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY

48,600 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS, A DECREASE FROM THE APPROXIMATELY 76,600

INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS WITH ACTIONS PENDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

ALLEGE USE OF SOME OF THE COMPANYS MASK AND RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND SEEK

DAMAGES FROM THE COMPANY AND OTHER DEFENDANTS FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY FROM

WORKPLACE EXPOSURES TO ASBESTOS, SILICA, COAL OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS,

FOUND IN PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS OR GENERALLY IN THE

WORKPLACE. THE REMAINING CLAIMANTS GENERALLY ALLEGE PERSONAL INJURY FROM

OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS FROM PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY MANUFACTURED BY THE

COMPANY, WHICH ARE OFTEN UNSPECIFIED, AND BY OTHER DEFENDANTS, OR OCCASIONALLY

AT COMPANY PREMISES.

IN MANY OF THESE LAWSUITS AND

CLAIMS, THE COMPANY IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT WITH MULTIPLE CO-DEFENDANTS WHERE

NO PRODUCT THE COMPANY MANUFACTURED IS IDENTIFIED OR WHERE THE COMPANY IS

ULTIMATELY DETERMINED NOT TO HAVE MANUFACTURED THE PRODUCTS IDENTIFIED BY THE

PLAINTIFFS. THE COMPANYS VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF THIS LITIGATION HAS RESULTED IN.

(I) DISMISSALS OF MANY LAWSUITS WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT BY THE COMPANY; (II) AN

AVERAGE SETTLEMENT VALUE OF LESS THAN $1,000 PER CLAIMANT FOR ALL OF THE CLAIMS

AND LAWSUITS THAT THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED, INCLUDING THOSE DISMISSED WITHOUT

PAYMENT; AND (III) JURY VERDICTS FOR THE COMPANY IN SIX OF THE SEVEN CASES

TRIED TO VERDICT (SUCH TRIALS OCCURRED IN 1999, 2000, 2003 AND 2004), AND AN

APPELLATE REVERSAL IN 2005 OF THE ONE JURY VERDICT ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE ASSERTED

SPECIFIC DOLLAR CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES IN APPROXIMATELY 59% OF THE 9,685 LAWSUITS

THAT WERE PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY AT THE END OF 2005 IN ALL JURISDICTIONS.

A MAJORITY OF STATES RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT SPECIFYING DAMAGES IN TORT CASES SUCH

AS THESE, AND MOST OF THE REMAINING JURISDICTIONS DO NOT REQUIRE SUCH

SPECIFICATION. IN THOSE CASES IN WHICH PLAINTIFFS CHOOSE TO ASSERT SPECIFIC

DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THEIR COMPLAINTS, BROUGHT IN STATES THAT PERMIT SUCH

PLEADING, THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED ARE TYPICALLY NOT MEANINGFUL AS AN INDICATOR OF

THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY.  THIS

IS BECAUSE (A) THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED TYPICALLY BEAR NO RELATION TO THE EXTENT OF

THE PLAINTIFFS INJURY, IF ANY; (B) THE COMPLAINTS NEARLY ALWAYS ASSERT CLAIMS

AGAINST MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS, WITH THE TYPICAL COMPLAINT ASSERTING CLAIMS

AGAINST AN AVERAGE OF 75 DIFFERENT DEFENDANTS, THE DAMAGES ALLEGED ARE NOT

ATTRIBUTED TO INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS, AND A DEFENDANTS SHARE OF LIABILITY MAY

TURN ON THE LAW OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY, WHICH CAN VARY BY STATE, AND BY

THE AMOUNT OF FAULT A JURY ALLOCATES TO EACH DEFENDANT IF A CASE IS ULTIMATELY

TRIED BEFORE A JURY; (C) MANY CASES ARE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY EVEN THOUGH

THE PLAINTIFFS DID NOT USE ANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND, ULTIMATELY, ARE

WITHDRAWN OR DISMISSED WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT; AND (D) MANY CASES ARE BROUGHT ON

BEHALF OF PLAINTIFFS WHO HAVE NOT SUFFERED ANY MEDICAL INJURY, AND, ULTIMATELY,

ARE RESOLVED WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT OR A PAYMENT THAT IS A SMALL FRACTION OF THE

DAMAGES INITIALLY CLAIMED. OF THE 5,741 PENDING CASES IN WHICH PURPORTED DAMAGE

AMOUNTS ARE SPECIFIED IN THE COMPLAINTS, SIX CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF AN

UNSTATED AMOUNT AND ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGE CLAIMS OF $1 MILLION; 4,098

CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $100,000 OR LESS (FIVE OF THESE CASES ALSO ALLEGE

PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $10,000, AND ONE ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $75,000), 229

CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS BETWEEN $100,000 AND $3 MILLION (83 OF THESE CASES ALSO

EACH ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $250,000, ONE OF THEM ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE

DAMAGES OF $1 MILLION, 45 OF THEM ALSO EACH ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $1.5

MILLION, AND 76 OF THEM EACH ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $2.5 MILLION), 31 CASES

INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $7.5 MILLION, ONE CASE HAS CLAIMS OF $8.65 MILLION, 1,352

CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $10 MILLION (ONE OF THESE CASES ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE

DAMAGES OF $350,000, ONE OF THEM ALSO ALLEGES $15 MILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES,

AND 1,285 OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE AN EQUAL AMOUNT IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES), 19 CASES

INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $15 MILLION (2 OF THESE CASES ALSO EACH ALLEGE AN EQUAL

AMOUNT IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES), THREE CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $20 MILLION (ALL OF

WHICH ALSO ALLEGE AN EQUAL AMOUNT IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES), AND TWO CASES INVOLVE

CLAIMS OF $50 MILLION (ONE OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $50

MILLION). SOME COMPLAINTS ALLEGE THAT THE COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE

AT LEAST THE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED.  AS

PREVIOUSLY STATED, THE COMPANY HAS MORE THAN 25 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN

DEFENDING LITIGATION OF THIS TYPE, HAS RESOLVED THE CLAIMS OF OVER 370,000

INDIVIDUALS WITH A CUMULATIVE AVERAGE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT OF LESS THAN $1,000 PER

CLAIMANT, AND BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE AND FOR THE OTHER REASONS CITED,

BELIEVES THAT THE DAMAGE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED IN COMPLAINTS ARE NOT A MEANINGFUL

FACTOR IN ANY ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE

STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA, THROUGH ITS ATTORNEY GENERAL, FILED A COMPLAINT IN 2003

AGAINST THE COMPANY AND TWO OTHER MANUFACTURERS OF RESPIRATORY PROTECTION

PRODUCTS IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF LINCOLN COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA. THE COMPLAINT

SEEKS SUBSTANTIAL, BUT UNSPECIFIED, COMPENSATORY DAMAGES PRIMARILY FOR

REIMBURSEMENT OF THE COSTS ALLEGEDLY INCURRED BY THE STATE FOR WORKERS

COMPENSATION AND HEALTHCARE BENEFITS PROVIDED TO MORE THAN 20,000 CURRENT OR

FORMER MINERS ALLEGEDLY SUFFERING FROM SILICOSIS AND/OR COAL MINERS

PNEUMOCONIOSIS (BLACK LUNG DISEASE) AND

UNSPECIFIED PUNITIVE

DAMAGES.

IN OCTOBER 2005,

THE STATE

OF WEST VIRGINIA FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT SEEKING

REIMBURSEMENT OF THE COSTS ALLEGEDLY INCURRED BY THE STATE FOR WORKERS

COMPENSATION AND HEALTHCARE BENEFITS PROVIDED TO

ALL WORKERS WITH

OCCUPATIONAL

PNEUMOCONIOSIS IN ALL

PROFESSIONS, NOT JUST TO COAL MINERS AS THE ORIGINAL COMPLAINT ALLEGED.

EMPLOYMENT LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ONE

CURRENT AND ONE FORMER EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION

IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF RAMSEY COUNTY, MINNESOTA IN DECEMBER 2004, SEEKING TO

REPRESENT A CLASS OF ALL CURRENT AND CERTAIN FORMER SALARIED EMPLOYEES EMPLOYED

BY 3M IN MINNESOTA BELOW A CERTAIN SALARY GRADE WHO WERE AGE 46 OR OLDER AT

65

ANY TIME DURING THE APPLICABLE

PERIOD TO BE DETERMINED BY THE COURT. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THE PLAINTIFFS

SUFFERED VARIOUS FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF AGE IN

VIOLATION OF THE MINNESOTA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT AND SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,

UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY (UP TO TRIPLE ACTUAL DAMAGES) AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN

EXCESS OF $50,000, INCLUDING BACK AND FRONT PAY AND ATTORNEYS FEES.  IN JANUARY 2006, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED A

MOTION TO JOIN FOUR ADDITIONAL PLAINTIFFS.

A SIMILAR AGE DISCRIMINATION

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION WAS FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN NOVEMBER 2005 IN THE

SUPERIOR COURT OF ESSEX COUNTY, NEW JERSEY ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OF NEW

JERSEY-BASED EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY REMOVED THIS CASE TO THE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF NEW JERSEY. IN ADDITION, THREE

FORMER EMPLOYEES FILED AGE DISCRIMINATION CHARGES AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH THE

U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND THE PERTINENT STATE AGENCIES

IN TEXAS, MINNESOTA AND CALIFORNIA, DURING 2005. SUCH FILINGS INCLUDE

ALLEGATIONS THAT THE RELEASE OF CLAIMS SIGNED BY CERTAIN FORMER EMPLOYEES IN

THE PURPORTED CLASS DEFINED IN THE CHARGES IS INVALID FOR VARIOUS REASONS. THE

SAME LAW FIRM REPRESENTS THE PLAINTIFFS AND CLAIMANTS IN EACH OF THESE

PROCEEDINGS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND

LITIGATION

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE

SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDING THOSE PERTAINING TO AIR

EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER DISCHARGES, TOXIC SUBSTANCES, AND THE HANDLING AND

DISPOSAL OF SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTES ENFORCEABLE BY NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL

AUTHORITIES AROUND THE WORLD, AND PRIVATE PARTIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND

ABROAD. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS PROVIDE, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A

BASIS FOR THE REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATION AND FOR PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY

DAMAGE CLAIMS. THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR, COSTS AND

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN COMPLYING WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, DEFENDING

PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS, AND MODIFYING ITS BUSINESS

OPERATIONS IN LIGHT OF ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES. IN ITS EFFORT TO

SATISFY ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

AND REGULATIONS, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED, AND PERIODICALLY UPDATES,

POLICIES RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR ITS OPERATIONS

WORLDWIDE.

REMEDIATION

: UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE

UNITED STATES COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY

ACT OF 1980 AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY MAY BE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY

LIABLE, TYPICALLY WITH OTHER COMPANIES, FOR THE COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL

CONTAMINATION AT CURRENT OR FORMER FACILITIES AND AT OFF-SITE LOCATIONS. THE

COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS LOCATIONS, MOST OF WHICH ARE IN THE UNITED STATES,

AT WHICH IT MAY HAVE SOME LIABILITY.

PLEASE REFER TO THE FOLLOWING

SECTION, ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THIS SUBJECT.

REGULATORY

ACTIVITIES

: AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN VOLUNTARILY COOPERATING WITH ONGOING

REVIEWS BY LOCAL, STATE, NATIONAL (PRIMARILY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

AGENCY (EPA)), AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES OF POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH

EFFECTS OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS (PERFLUROOCTANOIC ACID OR PFOA AND

PERFLUOROOCTANE SULFONATE OR PFOS). AS A RESULT OF ITS PHASE-OUT DECISION IN

MAY 2000, THE COMPANY NO LONGER MANUFACTURES PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS EXCEPT

THAT A SUBSIDIARY RECOVERS AND RECYCLES PFOA FOR INTERNAL USE IN PRODUCTION

PROCESSES.

IN

JANUARY, 2006, THE EPA ANNOUNCED A VOLUNTARY INITIATIVE UNDER WHICH EIGHT

COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARY REFERENCED ABOVE, WOULD

COMMIT TO REDUCE EMISSIONS AND PRODUCT CONTENT OF PFOA BY 95% BY 2010 OVER

LEVELS IN 2000, AND TO COMMIT TO WORKING TOWARD THE ELIMINATION OF PFOA FROM

EMISSIONS AND PRODUCTS BY 2015. THE COMPANY HAVING DECIDED TO PHASE OUT OF

PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY IN 2000 IS WELL POSITIONED TO COMPLY WITH THESE

OBJECTIVES.

IN JANUARY 2005, THE EPA ISSUED

A DRAFT RISK ASSESSMENT FOR PFOA AND SUBMITTED IT FOR REVIEW TO THE EPA SCIENCE

ADVISORY BOARD. THE EPA DOCUMENT EXPRESSES THE EPAS PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT IN

TERMS OF THE MARGIN OF EXPOSURE BETWEEN THE LEVELS OF THAT COMPOUND THAT CAUSE

ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS IN LABORATORY ANIMALS AND THE LEVELS FOUND IN HUMAN

BLOOD SERA IN THE U.S. POPULATION.

A PANEL CONVENED BY THE

SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD ISSUED A DRAFT REPORT IN JUNE 2005 AND A REVISED DRAFT IN

JANUARY 2006. THE SCIENCE BOARD HAS CONDITIONALLY APPROVED THE REVISED DRAFT OF

THE PANEL, WHICH AMONG OTHER THINGS RECOMMENDED THAT EPA CLASSIFY PFOA UNDER

THE EPA'S HAZARD DESCRIPTOR OF "LIKELY TO BE CARCINOGENIC TO HUMANS."

THE SELECTION BY THE PANEL OF THIS DESCRIPTOR WAS BASED UPON THE CONCLUSION OF

SOME PANEL MEMBERS THAT DATA FROM TWO STUDIES SHOW THAT PFOA IS A MULTISITE

CARCINOGEN IN RATS. THE COMPANY DISAGREES WITH THIS CLASSIFICATION SINCE THE

PANEL DID NOT CONSIDER OTHER IMPORTANT DATA. A FINAL REPORT IS EXPECTED TO BE

PREPARED AND SUBMITTED TO THE EPA, WHICH IN TURN WILL MAKE A FINAL RISK

ASSESSMENT BASED ON THE REPORT AND ADDITIONAL DATA NOT CONSIDERED BY THE

SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD. IN JANUARY 2006, THE EPA STATED THAT TO DATE IT

"IS NOT AWARE OF ANY STUDIES SPECIFICALLY RELATING CURRENT LEVELS OF PFOA

EXPOSURE TO HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS.



THE EPA SIGNED A MEMORANDUM OF

UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMPANY AND DYNEON LLC, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, IN

OCTOBER 2004, UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY IS MONITORING THE POTENTIAL PRESENCE OF

PFOA AT AND AROUND THE

66

COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN DECATUR,

ALABAMA. ACTIVITIES ARE IN PROGRESS PURSUANT TO THIS MEMORANDUM OF

UNDERSTANDING.

REGULATORY ACTIVITIES CONCERNING PFOA AND/OR

PFOS CONTINUE IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, AND BEFORE CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL BODIES.

THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE GATHERING OF EXPOSURE AND USE INFORMATION, RISK

ASSESSMENT, AND CONSIDERATION OF REGULATORY APPROACHES, INCLUDING A PROPOSAL

NOW PENDING BEFORE THE EUROPEAN UNION PARLIAMENT TO IMPLEMENT A MARKETING AND

USE DIRECTIVE TO REGULATE PFOS.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN COOPERATING WITH THE PROCESS TO REVIEW WHETHER

PFOS MEETS THE CRITERIA UNDER THE PROTOCOL FOR PERSISTENT ORGANIC POLLUTANTS (POPS

PROTOCOL). THIS PROTOCOL IS PART OF AN INTERNATIONAL TREATY KNOWN AS THE

CONVENTION ON LONG-RANGE TRANSBOUNDARY AIR POLLUTION (LRTAP). IN DECEMBER OF

2005, THE EXECUTIVE BODY COMPRISED OF PARTIES TO THE PROTOCOL DECIDED THAT THE

RECORD GENERATED UNDER THE PROTOCOL REVIEW PROCESS WAS SUFFICIENT TO DETERMINE THAT

PFOS QUALIFIES AS A POP AND THAT THE REVIEW PROCESS SHOULD NOW PROCEED TO A TRACK

B REVIEW FOCUSED ON THE ECONOMIC IMPACTS AND OTHER ASPECTS OF ADDING PFOS TO

THE PROTOCOL. THE UNITED STATES, WHICH HAS SIGNED BUT NOT YET RATIFIED THIS

PROTOCOL, INDICATED ITS DISAGREEMENT WITH THE EXECUTIVE BODY DECISION. PFOS

ALSO HAS BEEN NOMINATED FOR ADDITION TO ANOTHER INTERNATIONAL TREATY FOCUSED ON

POPS KNOWN AS THE STOCKHOLM CONVENTION. A PROCESS TO PREPARE A RISK PROFILE FOR

PFOS IS NOW PROCEEDING UNDER THAT CONVENTION.

THE COMPANY AND STATE AGENCIES

TESTED GROUNDWATER IN 2004 AND 2005 BENEATH THREE FORMER WASTE DISPOSAL SITES

IN WASHINGTON COUNTY, MINNESOTA, USED MANY YEARS AGO BY COMPANIES WITH WHICH

THE COMPANY CONTRACTED TO DISPOSE OF WASTE CONTAINING PERFLUOROOCTANYL

COMPOUNDS. THE TEST RESULTS SHOW THAT WATER FROM CERTAIN MUNICIPAL WELLS IN

OAKDALE, MINNESOTA NEAR TWO OF THE FORMER DISPOSAL SITES AND SOME PRIVATE WELLS

IN THAT VICINITY IN LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA CONTAIN LOW LEVELS OF PFOS AND PFOA.

THE MINNESOTA POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY IS PROVIDING CARBON FILTERS FOR A SMALL

NUMBER OF PRIVATE WELLS IN LAKE ELMO MEASURING ABOVE A LEVEL ESTABLISHED BY THE

MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH.  NO

PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS HAVE BEEN DETECTED IN WELLS IN THE VICINITY OF THE

THIRD FORMER DISPOSAL SITE IN WASHINGTON COUNTY. THE COMPANY HAS PROVIDED THE

TEST RESULTS FROM THESE PRIVATE AND MUNICIPAL WELLS IN LAKE ELMO AND OAKDALE TO

THE EPA.  ON ITS OWN INITIATIVE, THE

COMPANY PROPOSED AND HAS REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE CITY OF OAKDALE UNDER

WHICH THE COMPANY WILL AT ITS OWN EXPENSE CONSTRUCT, OPERATE AND MAINTAIN FOR

AT LEAST FIVE YEARS A GRANULAR ACTIVATED CARBON WATER TREATMENT SYSTEM TO TREAT

ONE OR MORE OF OAKDALES MUNICIPAL WELLS. THE COMPANY DONATED SEVERAL ACRES OF

LAND TO THE CITY OF LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA FOR A WATER TOWER AND GRANTED THE CITY

APPROXIMATELY $3.3 MILLION THAT THE CITY WILL USE TO EXPAND MUNICIPAL WATER

SERVICE TO NEIGHBORHOODS THAT INCLUDE A SMALL NUMBER OF PRIVATE WELLS IN WHICH

LEVELS OF PFOS AND PFOA HAVE BEEN DETECTED.

THE COMPANY MARKETS ITS NEWLY

REFORMULATED

SCOTCHGARD P

RODUCTS

(THAT REPLACE THE FORMULATIONS FROM WHICH THE COMPANY BEGAN ITS PHASE-OUT IN

2000), PURSUANT TO A CONSENT AGREEMENT WITH THE EPA THAT REQUIRES EXTENSIVE

HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS TESTING OF THE BASE CHEMISTRY UNDERLYING SUCH

PRODUCTS, MOST OF WHICH HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THE EPA HAS NOT YET ISSUED THE

ANTICIPATED HAZARD ASSESSMENT OF THAT HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS TESTING

FOR THE REFORMULATED SCOTCHGARD



PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHAT

REGULATORY ACTIONS ARISING FROM THE FOREGOING PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIVITIES, IF

ANY, MAY BE TAKEN REGARDING SUCH COMPOUNDS OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH

ACTIONS.

LITIGATION

: A FORMER EMPLOYEE FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN 2002 IN

THE CIRCUIT COURT OF MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA INVOLVING PERFLUOROOCTANYL

CHEMISTRY. THE LAWSUIT SEEKS UNSTATED COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND

ALLEGES THAT THE PLAINTIFFS SUFFERED FEAR, INCREASED RISK, SUB CLINICAL

INJURIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM EXPOSURE TO PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY AT OR

NEAR THE COMPANYS DECATUR, ALABAMA, MANUFACTURING FACILITY. THE COMPLAINT ALSO

ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY ACTED IMPROPERLY WITH RESPECT TO DISCLOSURES TO

WORKERS CONCERNING SUCH CHEMISTRY.

THE CIRCUIT

COURT IN 2005 GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS

PERSONAL INJURY-RELATED CLAIMS ON THE BASIS THAT SUCH CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE

EXCLUSIVITY PROVISIONS OF THE STATES WORKERS COMPENSATION ACT.  ALSO IN

2005,

THE JUDGE IN A SECOND PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT (FILED BY THREE RESIDENTS

OF MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA SEEKING UNSTATED COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES

INVOLVING ALLEGED DAMAGE TO THEIR PROPERTY FROM EMISSIONS OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL

COMPOUNDS FROM THE COMPANYS DECATUR, ALABAMA, MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT

FORMERLY PRODUCED THOSE COMPOUNDS) GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO ABATE THE

CASE, EFFECTIVELY PUTTING THE CASE ON HOLD PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF CLASS

CERTIFICATION ISSUES IN THE ACTION DESCRIBED ABOVE FILED IN THE SAME COURT IN

2002.

SIX RESIDENTS OF WASHINGTON COUNTY, MINNESOTA, FILED IN

OCTOBER 2004 A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF WASHINGTON

COUNTY ON BEHALF OF WASHINGTON COUNTY RESIDENTS WHOSE PROPERTY HAS ALLEGEDLY

BEEN HARMED AND WHO HAVE ALLEGEDLY SUFFERED PERSONAL INJURY FROM

ALLEGED

EMISSIONS FROM THE FORMER PERFLUOROOCTANYL PRODUCTION FACILITY AT COTTAGE

GROVE, MINNESOTA

.  THE LAWSUIT SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES IN

EXCESS OF $50,000 PER PLAINTIFF AND CLASS MEMBER.

AFTER THE DISTRICT

COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE CLAIMS FOR MEDICAL MONITORING

AND PUBLIC NUISANCE IN APRIL 2005, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT

ADDING ADDITIONAL ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING OTHER PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS

MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY, ALLEGING ADDITIONAL LEGAL THEORIES IN SUPPORT OF

THEIR

67

CLAIMS, AND SEEKING RELIEF BASED ON ALLEGED

CONTAMINATION OF THE CITY OF OAKDALE MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY AND CERTAIN PRIVATE

WELLS IN THE VICINITY OF LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA. PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS ARE IN

PROGRESS AND A HEARING ON PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO CERTIFY THE ACTION AS A CLASS

ACTION HAS BEEN SCHEDULED BY THE COURT FOR THE FALL OF 2006.

SEVERAL HUNDRED PLAINTIFFS WHO

CLAIM TO HAVE LIVED IN THE VICINITY OF THE ACME BARREL COMPANYS STORAGE DRUM

RECONDITIONING FACILITY IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2003 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS, AGAINST 3M AND A

NUMBER OF OTHER COMPANIES THAT ALLEGEDLY WERE CUSTOMERS OF ACME BARREL. THE

COMPLAINT SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY

THE PLAINTIFFS EXPOSURE TO CHEMICALS MIGRATING FROM ACME BARRELS DRUM

RECONDITIONING OPERATIONS. THE PLAINTIFFS ALSO ASSERT THAT A CLASS SHOULD BE

CERTIFIED ON BEHALF OF ALL PERSONS SIMILARLY SITUATED. A SEPARATE WRONGFUL

DEATH LAWSUIT WAS FILED IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS, AGAINST

3M AND A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPANIES ON BEHALF OF THE ESTATE AND FAMILY OF A

PERSON WHO WORKED AT THE COOK COUNTY JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER IN THE VICINITY

OF THE ACME BARREL FACILITY. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES FROM

PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO CHEMICALS MIGRATING

FROM ACME BARRELS DRUM RECONDITIONING OPERATIONS.

ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY COMPLIES WITH THE

REQUIREMENTS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 5, ACCOUNTING

FOR CONTINGENCIES, AND RELATED GUIDANCE, AND RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE IT CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF

THE LOSS AND WHERE LIABILITY IS PROBABLE.

WHERE THE REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABLE LOSS IS A RANGE, THE

COMPANY RECORDS THE MOST LIKELY ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS, OR THE LOW END OF THE

RANGE IF THERE IS NO ONE BEST ESTIMATE. THE COMPANY EITHER DISCLOSES THE AMOUNT

OF A POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF ESTABLISHED RESERVES IF

ESTIMABLE, OR STATES THAT SUCH AN ESTIMATE CANNOT BE MADE. FOR THOSE INSURED

MATTERS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN A RESERVE, THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS

RECEIVABLES FOR THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE THAT IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER UNDER THE

COMPANYS INSURANCE PROGRAM. FOR THOSE INSURED MATTERS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS

NOT TAKEN A RESERVE BECAUSE THE LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR THE AMOUNT OF THE

LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, BUT WHERE THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED AN

EXPENSE IN DEFENDING ITSELF, THE COMPANY RECORDS RECEIVABLES FOR THE AMOUNT OF

INSURANCE THAT IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER FOR THE EXPENSE INCURRED. THE COMPANY

DISCLOSES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS EVEN WHERE LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR

THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, IF THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED.

BECAUSE LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND

UNFAVORABLE RULINGS OR DEVELOPMENTS COULD OCCUR, THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT

THE COMPANY MAY NOT ULTIMATELY INCUR CHARGES IN EXCESS OF PRESENTLY RECORDED

LIABILITIES. A FUTURE ADVERSE RULING, SETTLEMENT, OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT

COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE

COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE

RECORDED. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT SUCH FUTURE CHARGES, IF ANY,

WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION

OF THE COMPANY, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS SIGNIFICANT AVAILABLE INSURANCE

COVERAGE. BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND DEVELOPMENTS, THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY

REEXAMINES ITS ESTIMATES OF PROBABLE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED EXPENSES AND

RECEIVABLES, AND WHETHER IT IS ABLE TO ESTIMATE A LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY

DETERMINED TO BE NOT ESTIMABLE AND/OR NOT PROBABLE. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE

COMPANY MAKES ADDITIONS TO OR ADJUSTMENTS OF ITS ESTIMATED LIABILITIES. AS A

RESULT, THE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY COULD CHANGE IN THE

FUTURE.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES INSURANCE

RECEIVABLES BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ITS NUMEROUS POLICIES, INCLUDING THEIR

EXCLUSIONS, PERTINENT CASE LAW INTERPRETING COMPARABLE POLICIES, ITS EXPERIENCE

WITH SIMILAR CLAIMS, AND ASSESSMENT OF THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM, AND RECORDS AN

AMOUNT IT HAS CONCLUDED IS LIKELY TO BE RECOVERED.

FOR

THOSE SIGNIFICANT PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE TABLE AND

THAT ARE NOT THE SUBJECT OF PENDING SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS

DETERMINED THAT

LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR

THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, AND THE COMPANY

IS

UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS AT THIS TIME. THE AMOUNTS

IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WITH RESPECT TO BREAST IMPLANT AND ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION REPRESENT THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE RESPECTIVE

LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY HAS RECORDED LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE TWO

PENDING TRANSPARENT TAPE ANTITRUST CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENTS.

BREAST IMPLANT INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE

COMPANY HAD RECEIVABLES FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO THE BREAST IMPLANT

MATTER OF $130 MILLION, REPRESENTING AMOUNTS COVERED BY THE MINNESOTA SUPREME

COURTS RULING OF AUGUST 2003 BUT YET TO BE RECEIVED AND OTHER AMOUNTS THAT

HAVE BEEN CLAIMED FROM VARIOUS REINSURERS, THE MINNESOTA INSURANCE GUARANTY

ASSOCIATION, AND THE ESTATES OF CERTAIN INSOLVENT INSURANCE CARRIERS.  THE COMPANY RECEIVED ABOUT $92 MILLION IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005 (BRINGING TOTAL RECOVERIES IN 2005 TO $148 MILLION),

OFFSETTING A PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED RECEIVABLE, PURSUANT TO

SETTLEMENTS WITH SEVEN INSURERS AND ONE REINSURER THAT WERE CONSISTENT WITH THE

COMPANYS OVERALL EXPECTATION OF RECOVERY AS A RESULT OF THE MINNESOTA SUPREME

COURT RULING. WITH THESE RECENT SETTLEMENTS AND THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED

SETTLEMENTS, 17 OF THE 29 INSURERS HAVE WITHDRAWN FROM THE PENDING PROCEEDINGS

AND HAVE SETTLED THE COMPANYS CLAIMS UNDER THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT

DECISION. VARIOUS FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF RECOVERY OF THE

BALANCE OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE RECEIVABLES, INCLUDING (I) ADDITIONAL DELAYS

IN OR AVOIDANCE OF PAYMENT BY INSURERS; (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH INSURERS MAY

BECOME INSOLVENT IN THE FUTURE, AND (III) THE OUTCOME OF THE PENDING LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE INSURERS.

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES AND

INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES, INCLUDING THE COST TO RESOLVE THE CLAIM

AND DEFENSE COSTS, BY EXAMINING: (I) THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING

CLAIMS, (II) APPARENT TRENDS, (III) THE APPARENT QUALITY OF CLAIMS (

E.G.,

THE COMPANY BELIEVES MANY

OF THE CLAIMS HAVE BEEN ASSERTED ON BEHALF OF ASYMPTOMATIC CLAIMANTS

),

(IV) CHANGES IN THE NATURE AND MIX OF CLAIMS (

E.G.,

THE PROPORTION OF CLAIMS ASSERTING USAGE OF THE COMPANYS MASK OR RESPIRATOR

PRODUCTS AND ALLEGING EXPOSURE TO EACH OF ASBESTOS, SILICA OR OTHER

OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS, AND CLAIMS PLEADING USE OF ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCTS

ALLEGEDLY MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY), (V) THE NUMBER OF CURRENT CLAIMS AND A

PROJECTION OF THE NUMBER OF FUTURE ASBESTOS AND OTHER CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED

AGAINST THE COMPANY, (VI) THE COST TO RESOLVE RECENTLY SETTLED CLAIMS, AND

(VII) AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST TO RESOLVE AND DEFEND AGAINST CURRENT AND FUTURE

CLAIMS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN PROJECTING THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS

THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ASSERTED, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS

RESPIRATORY PRODUCTS THAT THEMSELVES DID NOT CONTAIN ANY HARMFUL MATERIALS

(WHICH MAKES THE VARIOUS PUBLISHED STUDIES THAT PURPORT TO PROJECT FUTURE

ASBESTOS CLAIMS SUBSTANTIALLY REMOVED FROM THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXPERIENCE

AND WHICH THEMSELVES VARY WIDELY), THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS

ANY SINGLE BEST ESTIMATE OF THIS LIABILITY, NOR THAT IT CAN RELIABLY ESTIMATE

THE AMOUNT OR RANGE OF AMOUNTS BY WHICH THE LIABILITY MAY EXCEED THE RESERVE

THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED.

NO LIABILITY

HAS BEEN RECORDED REGARDING

THE PENDING ACTION BROUGHT BY THE WEST

VIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED.

DEVELOPMENTS MAY OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE

COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ITS LIABILITIES. THESE DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN (I) THE NUMBER OF FUTURE CLAIMS, (II) THE

AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS, (III) THE LEGAL COSTS OF DEFENDING THESE

CLAIMS AND IN MAINTAINING TRIAL READINESS, (IV) CHANGES IN THE MIX AND NATURE

OF CLAIMS RECEIVED, (V) TRIAL AND APPELLATE OUTCOMES, (VI) CHANGES IN THE LAW

AND PROCEDURE APPLICABLE TO THESE CLAIMS, AND (VII) THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF

OTHER CO-DEFENDANTS AND INSURERS. CONGRESS IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING LEGISLATION

THAT WOULD TERMINATE ESSENTIALLY ALL LITIGATION RELATED TO ASBESTOS (BUT NOT

OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS) IN EXCHANGE FOR SUBSTANTIAL ANNUAL PAYMENTS BY THE

DEFENDANT COMPANIES AND THEIR INSURERS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SUCH LEGISLATION, IF

ENACTED, WOULD BRING CONSIDERABLE CERTAINTY TO THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS

FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITY; THE COMPANY SUPPORTS SUCH LEGISLATION IN

PRINCIPLE, ALTHOUGH ENACTMENT OF THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION COULD CAUSE THE

COMPANY TO RECORD SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES.

AS A RESULT OF THE COSTS OF AGGRESSIVELY

DEFENDING ITSELF, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS

RESERVES IN THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2005 FOR RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES BY $30 MILLION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD RESERVES FOR RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS

LIABILITIES OF $210 MILLION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE

COMPANY HAD RECEIVABLES FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO THE RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION OF $447 MILLION. THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS RECEIVABLES

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005 FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION BY $15 MILLION AND RECEIVED PAYMENTS UNDER THE COMPANYS

INSURANCE PROGRAM OF $5 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2005 (BRINGING THE

TOTAL RECOVERIES IN 2005 TO $32 MILLION). WHILE THE COMPANY HAS SUBSTANTIAL

REMAINING CLAIMS-MADE AND OCCURRENCE (PRE-1986) INSURANCE COVERAGE, AS

PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED THIS ADDITIONAL RECEIVABLE REPRESENTS A LOWER PERCENTAGE

OF THE ADDITIONAL LIABILITY THAN WAS THE CASE WITH RECEIVABLES RECORDED PRIOR

TO 2004 PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF VARYING DEGREES OF PRIOR SETTLEMENTS WITH THE COMPANYS

INSURERS, INSOLVENCIES OF CERTAIN INSURERS, UNCERTAINTIES CONCERNING THE

PRECISE MANNER OF ASSIGNING

69

PARTICULAR COSTS TO SPECIFIC

POLICIES, POTENTIAL EXHAUSTION OF POLICIES, AND THE TYPES OF CLAIMS ASSERTED.

VARIOUS FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF RECOVERY OF THIS

RECEIVABLE, INCLUDING (I) DELAYS IN OR AVOIDANCE OF PAYMENT BY INSURERS; (II)

THE EXTENT TO WHICH INSURERS MAY BECOME INSOLVENT IN THE FUTURE, AND (III) THE

OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH INSURERS AND POSSIBLE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, IF

NECESSARY, WITH RESPECT TO RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITY INSURANCE

COVERAGE.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE

ACCRUED LIABILITY AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLE REPRESENTS IN PART THE TIME DELAY

BETWEEN PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND RECORDING OF LIABILITY (INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO

PROJECTED FUTURE CLAIMS) ON THE ONE HAND AND RECEIPT OF INSURANCE

REIMBURSEMENTS ON THE OTHER HAND. BECAUSE OF THE LAG TIME BETWEEN SETTLEMENT

AND PAYMENT OF A CLAIM, NO MEANINGFUL CONCLUSIONS MAY BE DRAWN FROM QUARTERLY

CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES FOR EXPECTED INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND THE

QUARTERLY CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER.

ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2005, THE COMPANY HAD RECORDED LIABILITIES OF $30 MILLION FOR

ESTIMATED ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS BASED UPON AN EVALUATION OF CURRENTLY

AVAILABLE FACTS WITH RESPECT TO EACH INDIVIDUAL SITE AND ALSO RECORDED RELATED

INSURANCE RECEIVABLES OF $15 MILLION. THE COMPANY RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR

REMEDIATION COSTS ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY

STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION. LIABILITIES FOR

ESTIMATED COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, DEPENDING ON THE SITE, ARE BASED

PRIMARILY UPON INTERNAL OR THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, AND ESTIMATES AS

TO THE NUMBER, PARTICIPATION LEVEL AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF ANY OTHER

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION AND THE NATURE

OF REQUIRED REMEDIAL ACTIONS. THE COMPANY ADJUSTS RECORDED LIABILITIES AS

FURTHER INFORMATION DEVELOPS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT

IT WILL PAY THE AMOUNTS RECORDED OVER THE PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE

APPLICABLE SITES, CURRENTLY RANGING UP TO 30 YEARS.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE

COST OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND REMEDIATION GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING

THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS,

THE EXTENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND THE EXISTENCE OF ALTERNATE

CLEANUP METHODS. DEVELOPMENTS MAY OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS CURRENT

ASSESSMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (I) CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION

AVAILABLE REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND

PRODUCTS; (II) CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR ENFORCEMENT POLICIES,

INCLUDING EFFORTS TO RECOVER NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES; (III) NEW AND EVOLVING

ANALYTICAL AND REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES; (IV) SUCCESS IN ALLOCATING LIABILITY TO

OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES; AND (V) THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND THIRD-PARTY INDEMNITORS.

NOTE 12.

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

THE COMPANY SPONSORS EMPLOYEE

SAVINGS PLANS UNDER SECTION 401(K) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THESE PLANS

ARE OFFERED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL REGULAR U.S. EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS

OF UP TO 6% OF COMPENSATION ARE MATCHED AT RATES RANGING FROM 35% TO 50%, WITH

ADDITIONAL COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS DEPENDING UPON COMPANY PERFORMANCE. ALL

COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS INITIALLY ARE INVESTED IN 3M COMMON STOCK, WITH EMPLOYEE

CONTRIBUTIONS INVESTED IN A NUMBER OF INVESTMENT FUNDS PURSUANT TO THEIR

ELECTIONS. VESTED EMPLOYEES MAY DIVERSIFY THEIR 3M SHARES INTO OTHER INVESTMENT

OPTIONS.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). THIS PLAN WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1989 AS A

COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OF FUNDING THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER

401(K) EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS. TOTAL ESOP SHARES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE SHARES

OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS.

DIVIDENDS ON SHARES HELD BY THE ESOP ARE PAID

TO THE ESOP TRUST AND, TOGETHER WITH COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS, ARE USED BY THE

ESOP TO REPAY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON THE OUTSTANDING NOTES. THE TAX BENEFIT

RELATED TO DIVIDENDS PAID ON UNALLOCATED SHARES WAS CHARGED DIRECTLY TO EQUITY

AND TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION IN BOTH 2005 AND 2004, AND $5

MILLION IN 2003. OVER THE LIFE OF THE

NOTES, SHARES ARE RELEASED FOR ALLOCATION TO PARTICIPANTS BASED ON THE RATIO OF

THE CURRENT YEARS DEBT SERVICE TO THE REMAINING DEBT SERVICE PRIOR TO THE

CURRENT PAYMENT.

THE ESOP HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE

SAVINGS PLANS. AS PERMITTED BY AICPA STATEMENT OF POSITION 93-6, EMPLOYERS

ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO

CONTINUE ITS PRACTICES, WHICH ARE BASED ON STATEMENT OF POSITION 76-3, ACCOUNTING

PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS AND SUBSEQUENT CONSENSUS

OF THE EITF OF THE FASB. ACCORDINGLY, THE DEBT OF THE ESOP IS RECORDED AS DEBT,

AND SHARES PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL ARE REPORTED AS UNEARNED COMPENSATION IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. UNEARNED COMPENSATION IS REDUCED

SYMMETRICALLY AS THE ESOP MAKES PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON THE DEBT. EXPENSES

RELATED TO THE ESOP INCLUDE TOTAL DEBT SERVICE ON THE NOTES, LESS DIVIDENDS.

THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES TREASURY SHARES, ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, TO

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS TO COVER OBLIGATIONS NOT FUNDED BY THE ESOP (REPORTED AS

AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE).

NOTE 15.  BUSINESS SEGMENTS

3MS BUSINESSES ARE ORGANIZED, MANAGED AND

INTERNALLY GROUPED INTO SEGMENTS BASED ON DIFFERENCES IN PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES

AND SERVICES. THESE SEGMENTS HAVE WORLDWIDE RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIRTUALLY ALL OF

THE COMPANYS PRODUCT LINES. 3M IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE PRODUCT OR

MARKET. TRANSACTIONS AMONG REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE RECORDED AT COST. 3M IS AN

INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE CHARACTERIZED BY SUBSTANTIAL INTERSEGMENT COOPERATION,

COST ALLOCATIONS AND INVENTORY TRANSFERS. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT

REPRESENT THAT THESE SEGMENTS, IF OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY, WOULD REPORT THE

OPERATING INCOME AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION SHOWN. THE ALLOCATIONS

RESULTING FROM THE SHARED UTILIZATION OF ASSETS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE
