general
3m is a diversified technology company with a
global presence in the following businesses: health care; industrial; display
and graphics; consumer and office; safety, security and protection services;
electronics and telecommunications; and transportation. 3m is among the leading
manufacturers of products for many of the markets it serves. most 3m products
involve expertise in product development, manufacturing and marketing, and are
subject to competition from products manufactured and sold by other
technologically oriented companies.
at december 31, 2005, the company employed 69,315
people, with 33,033 employed in the united states and 36,282 employed
internationally.
business segments
in 2005, 3m managed its operations in seven
operating business segments: health care; industrial; display and graphics;
consumer and office; electro and communications; safety, security and
protection services; and transportation. 3ms seven business segments bring
together common or related 3m technologies, enhancing the development of innovative
products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business
resources. these segments have worldwide responsibility for virtually all 3m
product lines. certain small businesses and staff-sponsored products, as well
as various corporate assets and expenses, are not allocated to the business
segments. financial
information and other disclosures relating to 3ms business segments and
operations in major geographic areas are provided in the notes to consolidated
financial statements.
effective
january 1, 2006, 3m combined its industrial and transportation business
segments. this new segment will leverage common markets, sales channels and
customers, technologies, manufacturing facilities and selling processes. this
combination will provide additional efficiencies that will be reinvested in
growth. the results for the new industrial and transportation segment can be
approximated by combining the existing industrial and transportation segments.

distribution
3m products are sold through numerous distribution
channels. products are sold directly to users and through numerous wholesalers,
retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in
many countries around the world. management believes the confidence of
wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3m and its
products, developed through long association with skilled marketing and sales
representatives, has contributed significantly to 3ms position in the
marketplace and to its growth. 3m has 188 sales offices worldwide, with 15 in
the united states and 173 internationally.
research and patents
research and product
development constitute an important part of 3ms activities. products resulting
from research and development have been a major driver of 3ms growth.
research, development and related expenses totaled $1.242 billion in 2005,
$1.194 billion in 2004 and $1.147 billion in 2003. research and development,
covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances
to the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $798
million in 2005, $759 million in 2004 and $749 million in 2003. related expenses primarily include technical
support provided to customers for existing products by 3m laboratories and costs
of internally developed patents.
the companys products are sold around the world
under various trademarks that are important to the company. the company also
owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous u.s. and foreign patents. the companys
research and development activities continuously generate inventions that are
covered by new patents. patents applicable to specific products extend for
varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent
grant and the
legal term of patents in the various countries
where patent protection is obtained. the actual protection afforded by a
patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of
patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the
country.
the company believes that its patents provide an
important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. in general, no
single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the company
as a whole or to any of the companys business segments. the importance of
patents in the health care and display and graphics segments is described in performance
by business segment  health care business and display and graphics
business in part ii, item 7, of this form 10-k.
raw materials
in 2005, the
company experienced both price increases and supply limitations affecting
several oil-derived raw materials, but to date the company is receiving
sufficient quantities of such materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable
production requirements. it is impossible to
predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages
would have. hurricanes katrina and rita resulted in tight supply conditions and
significant increases in energy costs, fuel surcharges and prices for certain
natural gas and petroleum related raw materials. 3m has avoided disruption to
its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw
material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply
sources. 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts,
price protection agreements and forward physical contracts.
environmental
law compliance
3ms manufacturing
operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around
the world. 3m has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures
for compliance with applicable laws. 3m is also involved in remediation actions
relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites (refer
to environmental liabilities and insurance receivables in note 11 commitments
and contingencies).
environmental expenditures
relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not
contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. liabilities for
remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable
and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility
studies or the companys commitment to a plan of action. environmental
expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future
operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives.
in 2005, 3m expended about
$26 million for capital projects related to protecting the environment. the
comparable amount in 2004 was about $67 million. these amounts exclude
expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by
past operations. capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included
pollution control devices  such as wastewater treatment plant improvements,
scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers
at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course
of business. consistent with the companys policies stressing environmental
responsibility, capital expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for
known projects are presently expected to be about $35 million over the next two
years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing
processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.
while the company cannot
predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital
expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance, the company does
not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures,
earnings or competitive position.

item 1a. risk
factors.
the most significant risk factors applicable to the company are as
follows:
results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic
conditions. the company operates in more than 60 countries and
derives approximately 60% of its revenues from outside the united states. the
companys business may be affected by factors in the united states and other
countries that are beyond its control, such as downturns in economic activity
in a specific country or region, or in the various industries in which the
company operates; social, political or labor conditions in a specific country
or region; or potential adverse changes in tax in the jurisdictions in which
the company operates.
the
companys results are affected by competitive conditions and customer
preferences. demand for
the companys products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected
by (i) the development and timing of introduction of competitive products; (ii)
the companys response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii) changes
in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory
maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be
affected by announced price changes, changes in the companys incentive
programs, or the customers ability to achieve incentive goals ; and (iv)
changes in customers preferences for our products, including changes in
customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the
companys products.
foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the
companys ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings. because the
company derives approximately 60% of its revenues from outside the united
states, its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings
could be adversely affected if the u.s. dollar strengthens significantly
against foreign currencies.
the
companys growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market
acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to renew its pipeline of new products and
to bring those products to market. this ability may be adversely
affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the
inability to: identify viable new products; obtain adequate intellectual
property protection; gain market acceptance of new products; or successfully
complete clinical trials and obtain regulatory approvals. for example, new 3m
pharmaceutical products, like any pharmaceutical under development, face
substantial risks and uncertainties in the process of development and
regulatory review. there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be
commercially successful.
the
companys future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and
availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials
and energy, including oil
and natural gas and their derivatives, due to
shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency exchange risks,
natural disasters and other factors. the company depends on various
components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas
and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products
and it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted
due to natural and other disasters and other events or terminated in the
future. any sustained interruption in the companys receipt of adequate
supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company. in addition,
while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and
material pricing, no assurance can be given that the company will be able to
successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or
shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company.
acquisitions,
strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from
portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and
possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. the company
monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and
may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and
changes to its organizational structure. with respect to acquisitions, future
results will be affected by the companys ability to quickly integrate an
acquired business and obtain the anticipated synergies.
the companys future results may be affected if the
company generates less productivity improvements than estimated. the
company utilizes various tools, such as six sigma, to improve operational
efficiency and productivity. there can be no assurance that all of the
estimated productivity improvements will be realized.
the companys future results may be affected by
various legal and regulatory proceedings, including those involving product
liability, antitrust, environmental or other matters. the outcome of
these legal proceedings may differ from the companys expectations because the
outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to
reliably predict. various factors or developments can lead the company to
change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where
applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not
susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial
ruling or judgment, significant settlement, significant regulatory development
or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling, settlement or
unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a
material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or cash flows in
any particular period. a specific factor that could increase the companys
estimate of its future asbestos-related liabilities is the pending congressional
consideration of legislation to reform asbestos-related litigation and

the above income and earnings per share
information exclude a cumulative effect of accounting change in 2005 ($35
million, or 4 cents per diluted share). effective january 1, 2006
the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no. 123
(revised 2004) and will use the modified retrospective method to adjust all
prior periods to give effect to the fair-value based method of accounting for
stock options. refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for
more detail on these two items.
as discussed in the notes to consolidated
financial statements, 2005 results included charges that reduced net income by
$75 million. this relates to a tax liability resulting from 3ms reinvestment
of approximately $1.8 billion of foreign earnings into the united states
pursuant to the repatriation provisions of the american jobs creation act of
2004. 2003 results included charges related to an adverse ruling
in a lawsuit filed against 3m in 1997 by lepages inc. that reduced operating income by $93million ($58 million after
tax).
2002 charges in connection with 3ms 2001/2002
restructuring plan reduced operating income by $202 million ($108 million after
tax and minority interest). 2001
includes net losses that reduced operating income by $504 million ($312 million
after tax and minority interest), principally related to charges in connection
with 3ms 2001/2002 restructuring plan, acquisition-related charges, a reversal
of a 1999 litigation accrual, and a net gain related to the sale of
available-for-sale equity securities, partially offset by the write-down of
available-for-sale equity securities.
item 7. managements
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
overview
3m is a diversified global manufacturer, technology
innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. in 2005, 3m managed its
operations in seven operating business segments: health care; industrial;
display and graphics; consumer and office; electro and communications; safety,
security and protection services; and transportation. refer to the performance
by business segment section for discussion of segment changes effective in the
first quarter of 2006.
3ms 2005 performance demonstrated the operational
strength of 3m and the value of the diversification of the 3m business
portfolio. 3ms sourcing organization and the businesses worked together to
maintain customer service, while successfully managing the business to avoid
supply disruptions in the face of hurricanes and shortages of key raw
materials. 3m increased its dividend 16.7%, the 47th consecutive
year of 3m dividend increases, and repurchased $2.3 billion of stock under its
stock repurchase authorization. the combination of dividends and stock
buy-backs returned a total of $3.6 billion to shareholders during 2005. 3m also
acquired cuno, a liquid filtration company.
in
2005, 3m reported record net sales of
$21.167 billion and record net income of $3.199 billion, or $4.12 per diluted
share, compared with net sales of $20.011 billion and net income of $2.990
billion, or $3.75 per diluted share, in 2004. the combination of a 5.8%
increase in net sales, including core local-currency sales growth of 4.1%
(which excludes the impact of businesses acquired in the last 12 months), and declining manufacturing costs as a percent
of sales, resulted in a 23.7% operating income profit margin.
in
2005, income before cumulative effect of accounting change totaled $3.234
billion, or $4.16 per diluted share. as of december 31, 2005, 3m adopted financial accounting standards
board interpretation (fasb) no. 47, accounting for conditional asset
retirement obligations (fin 47). the adoption of fin 47 resulted in an after
tax charge of $35 million, which is reflected as a cumulative change in
accounting principle (refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements
for more detail). in addition, during 2005,
3m completed its evaluation of the repatriation provision of the american jobs
creation act of 2004 and repatriated approximately $1.8 billion of foreign
earnings into the u.s. pursuant to its provisions. as a consequence, in the
second quarter of 2005, 3m recorded a tax expense of $75 million, net of
available foreign tax credits. combined, these two items reduced net income by
$110 million in 2005.

3ms performance in 2005 was broad-based, with all seven
business segments contributing to positive local-currency sales growth. sales growth in health care was led by 3ms core medical and dental
businesses and strong growth in health information systems, which helped
overcome the growth challenges of the pharmaceuticals and personal care
businesses. sales growth in the industrial segment was led by industrial adhesives and tapes, as well as the abrasives
businesses. the cuno acquisition added 5.1% to industrial sales growth. display and graphics sales
growth in display enhancement films used in
flat-panel devices was partially offset by the continued decline in lens
systems for
the crt rear projection television market along with the
phase out of the commercial videotape business. sales growth in the consumer
and office segment was broad-based across the many channels 3m serves, most
notably in the mass-market consumer and home improvement retail channels. for the
electro and communications segment, sales growth was led by demand for
3m electronic products for the semiconductor manufacturers, along with
continued strong growth in electrical products for insulating, testing and
sensing. sales growth in the safety, security
and protection services segment was driven by continued strong demand for
personal protection products and solutions, particularly respiratory protection
products, along with strong demand for cleaning and protection products for
commercial buildings. sales growth in the transportation segment was led by
both the automotive oem and repair markets. refer to the performance by
business segment section for a more detailed discussion of the results of the
respective segments.
geographically,
u.s. sales revenue increased 4.9%, asia pacific local-currency sales (which
exclude translation impacts) increased 10.6%, european
local-currency sales increased 0.9%, and the combined latin america and canada
area local-currency sales increased 1.3%. refer to the performance by
geographic area section for a more detailed discussion of the results for the
respective areas.
operating
income in 2005 increased by 9.4% versus 2004, as all seven business segments
posted increases. the combination of solid sales growth and positive benefits
from corporate initiatives helped drive the increase in operating income. the
company estimates that cost reduction projects related to initiatives provided
a combined incremental benefit to operating income of approximately $400 million
in 2005. these initiatives contributed more than $400 million to operating
income in both 2004 and 2003.
3m
generated $4.258 billion of operating cash flows in 2005, essentially flat when
compared to 2004, and ended the year with $1.072 billion of cash and cash
equivalents. in 2005, the company utilized approximately $3.6 billion of cash
to repurchase 3m common stock under its share repurchase authorization and to
pay dividends, and contributed $788 million to its pension and postretirement
plans. 3ms debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus
equity) as of december 31, 2005, was approximately 19%. 3m has an aa credit
rating from standard & poors and an aa1 credit rating from moodys
investors service.
the company experienced both price increases and supply limitations
affecting several oil-derived raw materials in 2005, which is expected to carry
forward into 2006, but to date the company
is receiving sufficient quantities of such materials to meet its reasonably
foreseeable production requirements. it
is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any
such shortages would have. hurricanes katrina and rita resulted in tight
supply conditions and significant increases in energy costs, fuel surcharges
and prices for certain natural gas and petroleum-related raw materials and
their derivatives. 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations
through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development
and qualification of additional supply sources. 3m manages commodity price
risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and
forward physical contracts. fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates
also impact results, although the company minimizes this effect through hedging
about half of this impact. 3m will also continue, as it has for many years, to
incur expenses (insured and uninsured) in managing its litigation and
environmental contingencies.
in 2006, 3m expects to drive profitable growth by investing in its most
promising commercialization, geographic and technology opportunities, with part
of this investment coming from savings generated through continuous operational
improvements. the company expects solid sales growth across the majority of its
business portfolio. the companys long history and unique ability to match
technological solutions with the needs of its customers has resulted in a
steady flow of new products and solutions, with this trend expected to continue
in 2006. in addition, the companys increasing focus on products and solutions
for emerging economies, such as asia and eastern europe, is expected to foster
significant growth in 2006. the company expects to increase both research and
development and capital expenditures in 2006, led primarily by growth programs.
research, development and related expenses totaled $1.242 billion in 2005, or
5.9% of sales. the company expects 2006 capital expenditures to total
approximately $1.1 billion, compared with $943 million in 2005, providing the capacity to meet expected
growth.
while 3m anticipates solid sales growth across the majority of its
businesses, sales are expected to decline in a few of its businesses. in health
care, 3m expects continued solid growth in its core medical and dental businesses
as 3m continues to invest in fast growth areas such as the alternate care
segment in medical, digital dentistry, and emerging markets. however, 3m
expects declines in its personal care business (which will become part of the
combined industrial and transportation segment in 2006) and in its branded
pharmaceuticals business (health care) to persist throughout 2006. 3m
experienced a sales decline in the fourth quarter of 2005 for metrogel-vaginal,
a womens health care product, due to a competitive product. 3m now expects
that there will be a generic
substitute approved for metrogel-vaginal, which accounts for
approximately 2% of total health care sales, in mid 2006. health care sales for
3ms aldara (imiquimod) pharmaceutical
product for the actinic keratosis (a pre-cancerous skin condition)
indication has and is expected to continue to fall short of expectations 3m had
at the time of fda approval and 3m is currently reassessing aldaras total market
potential. in display and graphics, 3m expects the continued negative impact
from the crt rear projection lens business to continue into the first half of
2006, with sales in the second half of 2006 expected to be comparable to the
second half of 2005. however, in display and graphics, 3m expects this decline
in crt rear projection lens sales to be more than offset by strong sales growth
in display enhancement films used in
flat-panel devices, such as lcd
televisions.

in 2005, local-currency
sales growth was broad based, with selling prices increasing 0.6%. along with the benefits provided by 3ms
sourcing initiative, 3ms pricing strategy has been key to maintaining margins
in the face of significant raw material price pressure. 3ms pricing strategy resulted in u.s. price
growth of 2.5% in 2005. internationally,
selling prices declined 0.7% in 2005.
adjusting for the price decreases in consumer electronics related
businesses (lcd films and flex circuits), international pricing would have
increased 0.3% in 2005. acquisitions increased 2005 sales by
1.0%, driven by the 2005 acquisition of cuno. refer to both the performance by business segment and performance by
geographic area sections for additional discussion of sales change.
in 2004, core volume
growth (which excludes the impact of businesses acquired in the last 12 months)
was broad-based, with all seven businesses posting worldwide local-currency
sales growth. local-currency growth was led by display and graphics;
industrial; consumer and office; safety, security and protection services; and
the transportation businesses. health care local-currency sales increased 1.7%,
as results were negatively impacted by 2003 sales from pharmaceutical and drug
delivery agreements that did not repeat in 2004. electro and communications
local-currency sales increased 2.7%, the first year of positive local-currency
sales growth since 2000. acquisitions increased 2004 sales by 0.5%, driven by
the 2004 acquisitions of highjump software, inc. and hornell holding ab. internationally, selling prices declined 1.1%, with most of the decline
coming in certain businesses that serve the electronics industry, where it is
important to look at the combined impact of volume and price. on a
geographic basis, local-currency sales growth in 2004 was led by the asia
pacific area.

cost of sales:
cost of sales decreased 0.8 percentage points in
2005. cost of sales as a percent of net sales benefited from the combination of
improved selling prices, favorable product mix, productivity gains, factory
efficiency and sourcing, which helped offset the impact of higher raw material
prices. raw material costs increased
approximately 6.0% for 2005 when compared to 2004, with this impact mitigated
through commodity hedging programs and negotiated supply contracts. cost of sales includes manufacturing,
engineering and freight costs.
the 2004 decrease as a percent of net sales was
driven by a combination of higher volumes, productivity gains, ongoing benefits
of corporate initiatives and positive currency impacts (including hedging
impacts). while 3m raw material costs increased during the year, 3ms global
sourcing initiative was important in enabling 3m to minimize raw material cost
increases during a period of commodity price inflation.
research,
development and related expenses:
research, development and related expenses as a
percent of sales were flat when comparing 2005 to 2004. however, spending in
dollars increased approximately 4%, reflecting 3ms continuing commitment to
fund future growth for the company.
selling,
general and administrative expenses:
selling, general and administrative (sg&a)
expenses as a percent of net sales were flat when comparing 2005 to 2004. 3m
continues to invest in growth programs and brand building throughout the
portfolio as a means of stimulating growth. sg&a in the fourth
quarter of 2005 was impacted by a pre-tax
charge of approximately $30 million in connection with settlement agreements of
one pending lepages follow-on class actions and of two individual follow-on
actions, all involving direct purchasers of transparent tape. for more detail,
refer to the discussion in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements.
selling, general and administrative expenses
improved by 0.5 percentage points in 2004 compared to 2003. the improvement in
2004 as a percent of net sales was helped by leverage related to 3ms strong
growth in the asia pacific area. sg&a expenses in u.s. dollars increased in
2004, negatively impacted by currency translation and increased advertising and
merchandising spending to support 3ms strong brand portfolio. on an ongoing
basis, the company is shifting sg&a dollars toward faster-growth businesses
and geographic areas.
other expense:
in 2003, 3m recorded
pre-tax charges of $93 million ($58 million after-tax) related to an adverse
ruling in a lawsuit filed against 3m in 1997 by lepages inc. the pre-tax
charge of $93 million is classified as other expense within operating income.
operating
income:
3m uses operating income as one of its primary
business segment performance measurement tools. operating income in 2005 was
23.7% of sales, up from 22.9% of sales in 2004 and 20.4% of sales in 2003.
operating income in 2005 grew by $431 million, or 9.4 percent, following 2004
operating income growth of $865 million, or 23.3 percent. the lepages inc.
lawsuit negatively impacted operating income in 2003 by $93 million, or 0.5% of
sales.

interest expense: interest expense increased in 2005 compared to 2004, primarily due to
higher interest rates. the decrease in 2004 interest expense was primarily the
result of lower average debt balances, partially offset by higher interest
rates in the united states.
interest income: interest income was higher in 2005, benefiting primarily from higher
interest rates. interest income increased in 2004 due to substantially higher
cash balances.

the tax rate for 2005 was 34.0%, compared with 33.0% in
2004. during 2005, 3m completed its evaluation of the repatriation provision of
the american jobs creation act of 2004 (jobs act) and repatriated approximately
$1.8 billion of foreign earnings into the u.s. pursuant to its provisions. the
jobs act provides 3m the opportunity to tax effectively repatriate foreign
earnings for u.s. qualifying investments specified by 3ms domestic
reinvestment plan. as a consequence, in
the second quarter of 2005, 3m recorded a tax expense of $75 million, net of
available foreign tax credits, which negatively impacted
the 2005 effective worldwide tax rate by 1.5%. a half-point tax rate reduction compared to the same periods last year
is primarily attributable to the combination of the effects of the medicare
modernization act and the domestic manufacturers deduction, which was a part
of the jobs act.
the tax rate of 33.0% for 2004 was comparable to
the 2003 rate of 32.9%. income taxes associated with repatriating certain cash
from outside the united states negatively impacted the 2004 and 2003 income tax
rates.
minority
interest:
(millions)
minority interest

minority interest expense eliminates the income or
loss attributable to non-3m ownership interests in 3m consolidated entities. 3ms
most significant consolidated entity with non-3m ownership interests is
sumitomo 3m limited in japan (3m owns 75% of sumitomo 3m limited). the decrease in 2005 related primarily to
lower net income in sumitomo 3m, while the increase in 2004 related primarily
to higher net income in sumitomo 3m.
cumulative
effect of accounting change:
as of december 31, 2005, the company adopted fasb interpretation no.
47, accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations (fin 47).
this accounting standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an asset
retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived
assets and where the liability can be reasonably estimated. conditional asset retirement
obligations exist for certain of the companys long-term assets. the fair value
of these obligations is recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis. over time the liabilities are accreted for
the change in the present value and the initial capitalized costs are
depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. the adoption of fin 47 resulted in the
recognition of an asset retirement obligation liability of $59 million and an
after tax charge of $35 million, which is reflected as a cumulative change in
accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income. the pro forma
effect of applying this guidance in all prior periods presented was determined
not to be material.
currency effects:
3m estimates that year-on-year currency effects,
including hedging impacts, increased net income by approximately $115 million
in 2005, $181 million in 2004 and $73 million in 2003. this estimate includes
the effect of translating profits from local currencies into u.s. dollars; the
impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations
in the united states and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including
derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate
risks. 3m estimates that year-on-year
derivative and other transaction gains and losses increased net income by
approximately $50 million for 2005 and $48 million in 2004. 3m estimates that
year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased net
income by $73 million in 2003.
performance by business segment
effective
january 1, 2006, 3m combined its industrial and transportation business
segments. this new segment will leverage common markets, sales channels and
customers, technologies, manufacturing facilities and selling processes. this
combination will provide additional efficiencies that will be reinvested in
growth. the results for the new industrial and transportation segment can be
approximated by combining the existing industrial and transportation segments.
in addition, during the first quarter of 2006, the personal care division (2005
annual sales of approximately $600 million) within the health care segment
transferred to the combined industrial and transportation segment. segment
information for all periods presented will be reclassified in 2006 to reflect
the combined industrial and transportation segment in addition to the transfer
of the personal care division.

the health care segment serves markets that
include medical, surgical, pharmaceutical, dental and orthodontic, health
information systems and personal care. products provided to these markets
include medical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention
products, pharmaceuticals, drug delivery systems, dental and orthodontic
products, health information systems, microbiology products, and closures for
disposable diapers.
in 2005, health care reported local-currency
sales growth of 2.9%. 3ms core medical and dental businesses and health
information systems businesses experienced local-currency sales growth of
approximately 6%. the strength of these businesses helped overcome the sales
growth challenges of the pharmaceutical and personal care businesses. personal
care, which is 3ms diaper tape business, has experienced significant raw
material price increases in some product lines over the past year, and 3m has
elected to drive profits at the expense of volume in this business, which has
the lowest margins in the health care segment. sales of certain products
within 3ms pharmaceuticals business, primarily comprised of prescription drugs
in inhalation, womens health, and cardiovascular, are declining due to price
pressure in europe and decreased demand for some of these older products. 3m continues to generate growth in its aldara
pharmaceutical product, which accounts for
approximately 6% of total health care sales. aldara sales grew nearly 10% in
2005, and growth outside the u.s. was particularly strong. however, fourth
quarter 2005 year-over-year local-currency sales declined for the first time
since the product was launched in 1997. health care sales for 3ms aldara
pharmaceutical product for the actinic keratois (a pre-cancerous skin
condition) indication has and is expected to continue to fall short of
expectations 3m had at the time of fda approval and 3m is
currently reassessing aldaras total market
potential. health care continued to focus on operational efficiency, which
helped drive an 8.2% increase in operating income in 2005. the companys agreement with takeda
pharmaceutical co., ltd., announced in early 2005 and described further below,
is currently the focus of the companys efforts to develop its immune response
modifier technology while the company reviews its other development efforts.
3m received u.s. food and drug administration (fda) approval for
aldara (imiquimod) cream, 5%, in 1996 for the treatment of external genital
warts, in march 2004 for the treatment of certain types of actinic keratosis (a
pre-cancerous skin condition), and in july 2004 for the treatment of
superficial basal cell carcinoma (a common form of non-melanoma skin cancer).
the patent and related rights for the imiquimod molecule are important to the
health care business. the original patent on the imiquimod molecule expired in
august 2004, but the patent term extension runs through august 2009, with an
anticipated pediatric exclusivity extension of a further six months to february
2010.
in
the first quarter of 2005, 3m and takeda pharmaceutical co. ltd. entered into
an agreement to collaborate on a potential breakthrough treatment utilizing an
immune response modifier for cervical high-risk human papilloma virus (hpv)
infection and cervical dysplasia, which are known risk factors for cervical
cancer. this immune response modifier
currently is in early stage clinical trials, and 3m and takeda will share
further development costs. upon successful clinical development and regulatory
approvals, the parties will commercialize jointly in the united states and
europe. takeda will hold commercial rights in certain countries in asia, while
3m will retain the rights in other parts of the world.
in
october 2003, ivax corporation agreed to assume exclusive rights to 3ms
branded health care respiratory products, together with related marketing and
sales personnel, in nine european countries. the agreement covered qvar
(beclomethasone dipropionate hfa) inhalation aerosol, a maintenance
medication used to prevent asthma attacks, and also covered airomir (albuterol
sulfate) inhaler, a rescue medication used to relieve acute asthma symptoms.
3m will continue to manufacture and supply these products to ivax. the total
consideration due under the agreement, including minimum annual royalty
payments, was $77 million, of which $24 million was paid in 2005, $24 million
was paid in 2004 and $26 million was paid in 2003. 3m expects to receive
$3million in 2006. 3m may also receive additional royalty payments in
2010 (up to a maximum of approximately $7 million in total) if ivax achieves
certain annual sales levels. the company recognizes the royalty revenue related
to the ivax agreement ratably over the term of the licensing arrangement.
in 2004, local-currency sales in health care increased 1.7%, with 2004
negatively impacted by 2003 pharmaceutical and drug delivery agreements that
did not repeat. fourth quarter 2004 local-currency sales grew 5.0%, as
year-on-year comparisons became more favorable. operating income increased 9.3%
to $1.123billion in 2004.

the industrial segment serves a broad range of
industrial markets, from appliance and electronics to paper and packaging and
food and beverage. products include tapes, a wide variety of coated and
nonwoven abrasives, adhesives, specialty materials and supply chain execution
software solutions. the august 2005 cuno acquisition adds a
comprehensive line of filtration products for the separation, clarification and
purification of fluids and gases.
in
2005, industrial local-currency sales grew 9.3%. the august 2005 cuno
acquisition, whose results are included in industrial, added 5.1% of growth in
2005. in addition to cuno, growth was led by industrial adhesives and tapes, as
well as the abrasives businesses. 3m continues to selectively raise selling
prices to offset commodity raw material
price
pressures. industrial continues to demonstrate strong operational discipline,
as operating income grew 20.5% in 2005.
in
2004, industrial local-currency sales growth of 8.2% for the year was
broad-based across major geographic areas and industrial businesses.
acquisitions increased sales by 1.4%, driven by the february 2004 acquisition
of highjump software, inc., a provider of supply chain execution software.
strong local-currency sales growth helped leverage operating income growth.
operating income increased 43.7% to $610 million in 2004.

the display and graphics segment serves markets
that include electronic display, touch screen, traffic safety and commercial graphics. this segment
includes optical film and lens solutions for electronic
displays; touch screens and touch monitors; reflective sheeting for
transportation safety; and commercial graphics
systems. the optical film business provides films that serve
numerous market segments of the display lighting industry. 3m provides distinct
products for five market segments, including products for: 1) lcd computer
monitors 2) lcd televisions 3) handheld devices such as cellular phones 4)
notebook pcs and 5) automotive displays. the optical business includes a number
of different products that are protected by various patents and groups of
patents. the remaining lifetimes of such patents, as well as patents protecting
future products, range from less than a few years to greater than 15 years.
these patents provide varying measures of exclusivity to 3m for a number of
such products. 3ms proprietary manufacturing technology and know-how also
provide a competitive advantage to 3m independent of such patents.
in 2005, display and graphics local-currency
sales grew 4.0%, impacted by many factors. the first half of 2005 was tempered
by tough year-on-year optical film comparisons, while 3ms traffic safety
systems business awaited a new highway funding bill in the u.s. and the
sluggish economies in western europe and japan held back growth in the
commercial graphics business. growth rebounded in the second half of 2005 as a
new u.s. highway funding bill was passed in july, the economies in western
europe and japan started to experience some moderate growth and, as expected,
3m saw acceleration in demand for consumer electronics, especially flat-panel
lcd televisions and a more normal lcd component inventory situation. this
growth in the second half of 2005 drove record sales of 3ms proprietary
optical films and components despite growing pricing pressure. display and
graphics sales growth was negatively impacted by approximately 4% in 2005 due
to the continued decline in lens systems for the crt rear projection television
market along with the phase out of the commercial videotape business announced
in the fourth quarter of 2004. operating income increased 2.3% in 2005. operating income was impacted by the
commercial videotape business phase out and decline in lens systems for the crt
rear projection television market, which negatively impacted 2005 operating
income by approximately 8%.
in 2004, display and graphics local-currency
sales growth was 10.5%. strong demand for 3m films that brighten the displays
on electronic products, such as flat-panel computer monitors, cellular phones,
notebook pcs and lcd televisions, continued to drive results in 2004.
year-on-year local-currency sales growth in the optical systems business was slower
in the last half of 2004, primarily due to inventory channel adjustments in the
lcd market. this resulted in reduced demand for 3ms proprietary optical films
and components. while this business is subject to periodic customer inventory
fluctuations, 3m believes that this business will continue to be a significant
growth engine for 3m. in the fourth quarter of 2004, 3m announced the phase out
of its commercial videotape business, and this action, combined with a
continuing decline in lens systems for the crt rear-projection television
market, negatively impacted sales and operating income. operating income
increased 27.9% to $1.133 billion in 2004.

security and productivity of workers, facilities and systems. major product
offerings include personal protection products, safety and security products,
energy control products, cleaning and protection products for commercial
establishments, and roofing granules for asphalt shingles.
in 2005, safety, security and protection services
local-currency sales growth was 6.9%, driven by broad-based growth across the
business portfolio and geographies. the continued global threat of events such
as terrorism, natural disasters, sars and avian flu helped raise the awareness
in the general public about the importance of personal protective equipment,
especially respiratory protection for overall health. sales growth was driven
by continued strong global demand for personal protection products and
solutions, particularly respiratory protection products, along with strong demand
for cleaning and protection products for commercial buildings. roofing granules
for asphalt shingles also experienced solid sales growth. operating income
improved 12.6% in 2005.
in 2004, safety, security and protection services
local-currency sales growth was 6.6%. local-currency growth was driven by
strong global demand for personal protective products and solutions, along with

the transportation segment serves markets that include automotive,
automotive aftermarket, marine, aerospace and specialty vehicle markets. this
segment provides components and products that are used in the manufacture,
repair and maintenance of automotive, marine, aircraft and specialty vehicles.
in 2005, transportation local-currency sales
growth was 5.0%, with benefits from customer-focused new products and
productivity solutions driving results. one of these new products is 3m paint replacement film, which
is an alternative to using paint around car and truck windows. in the
automotive aftermarket area, the 3m paint preparation system shortens paint changeover
and clean-up time while also reducing the use of solvents for cleaning paint
guns. sales growth was broad based
in transportation, led by businesses that serve the automotive oems and auto
body repair shops, despite challenges in the u.s. oem big-3 automotive market
along with lower levels of distribution buy-in due to cash flow trade-offs by
customers in the automotive aftermarket business. operating income increased
8.1% in 2005.
in march 2005, 3ms automotive business completed the purchase from
ti&m beteiligungsgesellschaft mbh of 19 percent of i&t innovation
technology (i&t), which was founded in austria in 1999. 3m and i&t will collaborate to deliver
flat flexible wiring systems for automotive interior applications to the global
automotive market. the purchase price of approximately $55 million is reported
as investments in the consolidated balance sheet and as purchases of
investments in the consolidated statement of cash flows. due to its distribution involvement and
voting rights, the company is using equity method accounting for its investment
in i&t. the company has a purchase option to buy an additional 31%
investment of i&t after certain conditions have been met. this purchase option expires december 31,
2008. the company also has a put option,
which provides the company the right to sell back its entire ownership interest
in i&t, exercisable between january 1, 2007 and march 31, 2009, unless the
company exercises its purchase option before then.
in 2004, local-currency sales growth was 5.1% in

while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its
business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the
company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure.
export sales are reported within the geographic area where the final sales to
3m customers are made. a portion of the
products or components sold by 3ms operations to its customers are exported by
these customers to different geographic areas. as customers move their
operations from one geographic area to another, 3ms results will follow. thus,
net sales in a particular geography is not indicative of end-user consumption
in that geography.
u.s.
sales revenue increased 4.9%, with growth led by industrial; consumer and
office; and safety, security and protection services. asia pacific
local-currency sales (which exclude translation impacts) increased 10.6%. all
seven business segments contributed to this increase in the asia pacific area,
with optical film being the largest growth component. japan sales totaled
approximately $2.1 billion, with local-currency sales up 3.6% from 2004. european local-currency sales increased 0.9%,
with good growth in industrial; safety, security and protection services; and
transportation. in the combined latin america and canada area, local-currency
sales increases of 1.3% were led by consumer and office; industrial; safety,
security and protection services; and transportation. growth in latin america
was impacted by the continued decline of 3ms crt rear projection lens business
in mexico and the move of a flex circuits customer from puerto rico to
singapore. foreign currency translation positively impacted the combined
latin america and canada area sales by 7.4%, and the asia pacific area sales by
0.5%, as the u.s. dollar weakened against these currencies. foreign currency
translation had a minimal impact on european sales. for 2005, international operations represented approximately 61% of 3ms
sales.

employment:
employment increased by 2,244 people since
year-end 2004. the cuno acquisition in august 2005 added approximately 2,300
employees. the company continues to increase headcount in faster-growing areas
of the world, such as asia pacific, primarily to support increasing local
sales. excluding the impact of cuno, employment has been decreasing in the
united states and combined europe, middle east and africa area. sales per
employee in local currencies increased approximately 4% in 2005, approximately
7% in 2004 and 8.5% in 2003.
capital
spending/net property, plant and equipment:
the bulk of 3m capital spending historically has
been in the united states, resulting in higher net property, plant and
equipment balances in the u.s. the company is striving to more closely align
its manufacturing and sourcing with geographic market sales, and because
approximately 61% of sales are outside the united states, this would increase production
outside the united states, helping to improve customer service and reduce
working capital requirements. the 2005
decrease in net property, plant and equipment in the europe, middle east and
africa area was primarily due to currency
translation (due to the stronger u.s dollar at december 31, 2005 when compared
to december 31, 2004). capital spending in asia has more than doubled since
2003 as we continue to grow our presence in this region.
critical accounting estimates
information regarding significant accounting
policies is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements. as
stated in note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the
circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about
the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent
from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company believes its most critical accounting
estimates relate to legal proceedings, the companys pension and postretirement
obligations, and potential asset impairment issues. senior management has
discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting
estimates with the audit committee of 3ms board of directors.
legal proceedings:
the categories of claims for which the company has
estimated its probable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the
estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting
estimates related to legal proceedings. please refer to the section entitled accrued
liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings (contained
in legal proceedings in note 11 to the consolidated financial statements) for
additional information about such estimates.
pension and postretirement obligations:
3m
has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all u.s.
employees and many employees outside the united states. the company accounts
for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life
insurance benefit plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting
standards (sfas) no.87, employers accounting for pensions and sfas no.
106, employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions,
which require that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on
an actuarial basis. pension benefits associated with these plans are generally
based primarily on each participants years of service, compensation, and age
at retirement or termination. two critical assumptions, the discount rate and
the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and
liability measurement. the assumed health care trend rate is the most
significant postretirement health care assumption. see note10 to the
consolidated financial statements for additional discussion of actuarial
assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care
liabilities and expenses.
the
company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the
december 31 measurement date for the u.s. pension and postretirement benefit
plans. the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated
liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. in estimating
this rate, the company looks at rates of return on fixed-income investments of
similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive high, investment
grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies. using these methodologies, the
company determined a discount rate of 5.50% to be appropriate as of
december31, 2005, which is a reduction of 0.25 percentage points from the
rate used as of december 31, 2004.
as
of december 31, 2005, the company converted to the rp (retirement plans) 2000
mortality table for calculating the year-end 2005 u.s. pension and
postretirement obligations and 2006 expense. the impact of this change
increased the year-end 2005 u.s. projected benefit obligations for pension by $385
million, the year-end 2005 u.s. accumulated benefit obligations for pension by
$349 million and the 2005 u.s. accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by
$93 million. this change will also increase pension expenses for 2006 by $64
million and postretirement expenses by $17 million.
a
significant element in determining the companys pension expense in accordance
with sfas no.87 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on
historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. for the u.s.
pension plan, the companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets
was 8.75% for 2005 and will remain at 8.75% for 2006. refer to note 10 to the
consolidated financial statements for information on how this rate is
determined.
the
difference between the expected return and the actual return on plan assets is
deferred and, under certain circumstances, amortized over future years of
service. therefore, the net deferral of past asset gains (losses) ultimately
affects future pension expense. this is also true of changes to actuarial
assumptions. as of december 31, 2005, the company had net unrecognized pension
actuarial losses of $2.676 billion and $954 million for the u.s. and
international pension benefit plans, respectively, and $1.005 billion for the
postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plan. these amounts
represent potential future pension and postretirement expenses that would be
amortized over average future service periods. the average remaining service
periods for u.s. and international pension plans and the postretirement plans
are 10.2 years, 14.1 years and 10.0 years, respectively.
for
the year ended december31, 2005, the company recognized total
consolidated pre-tax pension expense (after settlements, curtailments and
special termination benefits) of $331million, up from $325million
in 2004. pension expense (before settlements, curtailments and special
termination benefits) is anticipated to decrease to approximately
$300million in 2006. for the pension plans, holding all other factors
constant, an increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan
assets by 0.25 percentage points would decrease/increase u.s. 2006 pension
expense by approximately $22million for u.s. pension plans and approximately
$7 million for
international
pension plans. also, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease
in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities by 0.25 percentage points
would decrease/increase 2006 pension expense by approximately $31 million for
u.s. pension plans and approximately $7 million for international pension
plans. see note10 to the consolidated financial statements for details of
the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care trend rates
on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation.
potential asset impairment issues:
3m
net property, plant and equipment totaled approximately $5.6 billion at
december 31, 2005. management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the
consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over
long periods of time. this includes the recoverability of long-lived assets
employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. these
estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically
adjusted as circumstances warrant. for instance, expected asset lives may be
shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of
the asset or performance of the related business reporting unit.
3m
goodwill totaled approximately $3.5 billion at december 31, 2005, which, based
on impairment testing, is not impaired. impairment testing for goodwill is done
at a reporting unit level. reporting units are one level below the business
segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment
have similar economic characteristics. 3m had 18 reporting units at december
31, 2005. the majority of goodwill relates to and is assigned directly to a
specific reporting unit. an impairment loss generally would be recognized when
the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds the estimated
fair value of the reporting unit. the estimated fair value of a reporting unit
is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a
price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted
cash flow analysis.
new accounting pronouncements
as of december 31, 2005, the company adopted fasb interpretation no.
47, accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations (fin
47). this accounting standard applies to
the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation associated
with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and where the liability can
be reasonably estimated. conditional asset retirement obligations exist for
certain of the companys long-term assets. the fair value of these obligations
is recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis. over time the liabilities are
accreted for the change in the present value and the initial capitalized costs
are depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. the adoption of fin 47 resulted in the
recognition of an asset retirement obligation liability of $59 million and an
after tax charge of $35 million, which is reflected as a cumulative change in
accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income. the pro forma
effect of applying this guidance in all prior periods presented was determined
not to be material.
effective january 1, 2006, 3m adopted sfas no. 123
(revised 2004), share-based payment, which requires 3m to expense stock-based
compensation expense. the company is adopting sfas no. 123r using the modified
retrospective method. all prior periods will be adjusted to give effect to the
fair-value-based method of accounting for awards granted in fiscal years
beginning on or after january 1, 1995. stock-based compensation disclosures in
note 1 reflect pro forma expense of $.14 cents per diluted share in 2005. the 2006 impact
of adopting sfas no. 123r is estimated to be approximately $.16 per diluted
share with an estimated $0.02 per diluted share cost in the first quarter, an
estimated $0.08 per diluted share cost in the second quarter, and an estimated
$0.03 per diluted share cost in both the third and fourth quarters. the pro
forma impact of stock-based compensation on net income and earnings per share
provided in note 1 for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004 and 2003, was
recognized over the nominal vesting period, whereby if an employee retired
before the end of the vesting period, the company would recognize any remaining
unrecognized compensation cost at the date of retirement. sfas no. 123r
requires recognition under a non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring
compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. 3m
employees in the u.s. are eligible to retire beginning at age 55 and after
having completed five years of service. approximately 25 to 30% of the number
of stock-based compensation awards are made to this population. the company
will change to the non-substantive vesting period approach for new stock
compensation grants made after the companys adoption of sfas no. 123r on
january 1, 2006. therefore, primarily beginning in may 2006 with the annual
management stock ownership program grant, immediate expensing of those
stock-based compensation awards granted to employees eligible to retire will
result in a higher compensation expense than historically recognized in comparable
prior periods. the total expense in 2006
and beyond will depend on several variables, including the number of
share-based awards granted, the fair value of those awards, and the period the
vesting of those awards is recognized over; therefore the actual expense may be
different from this estimate.
additional
information regarding these and other accounting pronouncements is included in
note 1 to the consolidated financial statements.
financial condition and liquidity
the
company generates significant ongoing cash flow. net debt decreased
significantly in 2004, but increased in 2005, primarily related to the $1.36

believes its ongoing cash flows provide ample cash to fund expected investments
and capital expenditures. the company has an aa credit rating from standard
& poors and an aa1 credit rating from moodys investors service. the
company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated
growth and acquisition investment funding needs. the company does not utilize
derivative instruments linked to the companys stock. however, the company does
have contingently convertible debt that, if conditions for conversion are met,
is convertible into shares of 3m common stock (refer to note 8 in this
document).
the companys financial condition and liquidity
at december 31, 2005, remained strong. various
assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate
significantly from month-to-month depending on short-term liquidity needs. working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities)
totaled $1.877 billion at december 31, 2005, compared with $2.649 billion at
december 31, 2004. this decrease was primarily related to a decrease in cash
and cash equivalents ($1.685billion) partially offset by a decrease in
debt classified as short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt
($1.022 billion). the cash and cash equivalents balance was impacted by the
acquisition of cuno and repayment of debt.
the company uses various working capital measures that
place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities.
these measures are not defined under u.s. generally accepted accounting
principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures
used by other companies. one of the
primary working capital measures 3m uses is
a combined index, which includes accounts receivables, inventory and accounts
payable. this combined index (defined as quarterly net sales  fourth quarter
at year-end  multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable
plus inventory less accounts payable) was 5.7 at december 31, 2005, down from
5.8 at december 31, 2004. excluding cuno, net working capital turns at december
31, 2005, were 5.8, the same as at december 31, 2004. receivables increased $46
million, or 1.6%, compared with december 31, 2004. at december 31, 2005, the
cuno acquisition increased accounts receivable by $88 million. currency
translation (due to the stronger u.s dollar) reduced accounts receivable by
$231 million year-on-year. inventories increased $265 million, or 14.0%,
compared with december 31, 2004. at december 31, 2005, the cuno acquisition
increased inventories by $56 million. currency translation reduced inventories
by $89 million year-on-year. accounts payable increased $88 million compared
with december 31, 2004, with cuno accounting for $18 million of this increase.
cash flows from operating, investing and financing
activities are provided in the tables that follow. individual amounts in the
consolidated statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions,
divestitures and exchange rate impacts, which are presented separately in the
cash flows. thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing

cash
flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to
period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items
can significantly impact cash flows. in 2005, cash flow was essentially flat
when compared to 2004. higher net income, higher accounts payable and increased
insurance receivable collections were offset by accounts receivable increases,
inventory increases and other items. product and other insurance receivables
and claims increased cash flow by $122 million in 2005, benefiting from the
$148 million in insurance recoveries for the breast implant matter in 2005. for a more detailed discussion of these and other
legal proceedings, refer to note 11 in the consolidated financial statements of
this annual report on form 10-k. the category other  net in the preceding
table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts. for example, in
2005, this category includes the non-cash impact of adopting fin 47 ($35
million cumulative effect of accounting change), increases in accrued
liabilities (such as the $30 million increase in liability related to legal
settlement agreements), and other items.
in 2005, the company made discretionary contributions totaling $500
million to its u.s. qualified pension plan, with $200 million contributed in
the fourth quarter of 2005, and $300 million contributed in the third quarter
of 2005. in the third quarter of 2004, the company made a special pension
contribution to 3ms japanese pension plan of $155 million and a discretionary
contribution of $300 million to its u.s. qualified pension plan. in the third
quarter of 2003, 3m made a discretionary contribution of $600 million to its
u.s. qualified pension plan. future contributions will depend on market
conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3m believes its strong cash flow
and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising
growth opportunities.
in 2004, cash flow improvements were primarily driven by higher net
income. in all periods presented, significant company pension contributions
negatively impacted cash flows. in all
years, with a larger amount in 2003, a portion of the tax timing benefit
relates to the tax benefit received from company pension contributions.

investments
in property, plant and equipment are enabling growth in diverse markets,
helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. these investments will continue to be primarily
capacity and growth focused. for example, in december 2005, 3m announced
its intention to build an lcd optical film manufacturing facility in poland to
support the fast-growing lcd-tv market in europe and to better serve its
customers. the company expects 2006 capital expenditures to total approximately
$1.1 billion, compared with $943 million in 2005.
in
the third quarter of 2005, 3m completed the acquisition of cuno. 3m acquired
cuno for approximately $1.36 billion, including assumption of debt. this $1.36
billion included $1.27 billion of cash paid (net of cash acquired) and the
assumption of $80 million of debt, most of which has been repaid. in 2005, the
company also entered into two additional business combinations for a total
purchase price of $27 million. refer to note 2 to the consolidated financial
statements for more information on these 2005 business combinations, and for
information concerning 2004 and 2003 business combinations.
purchases of investments in 2005 include the purchase from ti&m
beteiligungsgesellschaft mbh of 19 percent of i&t innovation technology
(discussed previously under the transportation business segment). the purchase
price of approximately $55 million is reported as investments in the
consolidated balance sheet and as purchases of investments in the
consolidated statement of cash flows. other purchases of investments and proceeds from
sale of investments in 2005 are primarily attributable to auction rate securities,
which are classified as available-for-sale. prior to 2005, purchases of and
proceeds from the sale of auction rate securities were classified as cash and
cash equivalents. at december 31, 2004, the amount of such securities taken as
a whole was immaterial to cash and cash equivalents, and accordingly were not
reclassified for 2004 and prior. proceeds
from the sale of investments in 2003 include $26 million of cash received
related to the sale of 3ms 50% ownership in durel corporation to rogers
corporation. additional purchases of
investments totaled $5 million in 2005, $10 million in 2004 and
$16million in 2003. these purchases include additional survivor benefit
insurance and equity investments.
the company is actively considering additional acquisitions,
investments and strategic alliances.

total
debt at december 31, 2005, was $2.381 billion, down from $2.821 billion at
year-end 2004, with the decrease primarily attributable to the retirement of
$400 million in medium-term notes. there
were no new long-term debt issuances in 2005. in 2005, the cash flow
decrease in net short-term debt of $258 million includes the portion of
short-term debt with original maturities of 90 days or less. the repayment of
debt of $656 million primarily related to the retirement of $400 million in
medium-term notes and commercial paper retirements. proceeds from debt of $429
million primarily related to commercial paper issuances. total debt was 19% of total capital (total
capital is defined as debt plus equity),
compared with 21% at year-end 2004.
debt
securities, including the companys shelf registration, its medium-term notes
program, dealer remarketable securities and convertible note, are all discussed
in more detail in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements. 3m has a
shelf registration and medium-term notes program through which $1.5 billion of
medium-term notes may be offered. in 2004, the company issued approximately $62
million in debt securities under its medium-term notes program. no debt was
issued under this program in 2005. the medium-term notes program and shelf registration
have remaining capacity of approximately $1.438billion. the
companys $350 million of dealer remarketable securities (classified as current
portion of long-term debt) were remarketed for one year in december 2005. in
addition, the company has convertible notes with a book value of $539 million
at december 31, 2005.
the
next put option date for these convertible notes is november 2007, thus at
year-end 2005 this debt is classified as long-term debt. at december 31, 2005,
the dealer remarketable securities and $62 million of medium-term notes are
classified as current portion of long-term debt as the result of put provisions
associated with these debt instruments. for a discussion of accounting
pronouncements that will affect accounting treatment for the convertible note,
refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial statements for discussion of eitf
issue no. 04-08, the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted
earnings per share and proposed sfas no. 128r, earnings per share.
repurchases of common stock are made to support
the companys stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate
purposes. on
november 8, 2004, the board of directors authorized the purchase of $2.0 billion of the companys common stock
between january 1, 2005 and january 31, 2006.
in october 2005, 3ms board of directors authorized the repurchase of an
additional $300 million of the companys stock through january 31, 2006. this increased the total repurchase authorization
to $2.3 billion for the period through january 31, 2006. as of december 31,
2005, substantially all of this repurchase authorization had been utilized.
refer to the table captioned issuer purchases of equity securities in part
ii, item 5, for more information.
cash dividends paid to stockholders totaled $1.286 billion ($1.68 per
share) in 2005, $1.125 billion ($1.44 per share) in 2004 and $1.034 billion
($1.32 per share) in 2003. 3m has paid dividends since 1916. other cash flows from financing activities include
distributions to minority interests, changes in cash overdraft balances, and
principal payments for capital leases.
liquidity:
the
companys liquidity remains strong. primary short-term liquidity needs are
provided through u.s. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. as
of december 31, 2005, outstanding total commercial paper issued totaled $514
million and averaged approximately $823 million during 2005. medium-term note
shelf borrowing capacity totaled $1.438 billion as of december 31, 2005. credit
support for outstanding commercial paper is provided by a $565 million credit
agreement among a group of primary relationship banks. in march 2005, the company replaced its
364-day credit agreement with a five-year credit agreement with similar terms.
this $565 million credit facility provides up to $115 million in letters of
credit ($97 million of which was utilized at december 31, 2005), with
provisions for increasing this limit up to $150 million. committed credit facilities of $53 million are in
place across several international subsidiary locations.
the company believes it is unlikely that its access to
the commercial paper market will be restricted. cash and cash equivalents and
certain other current assets could provide additional liquidity to meet near
term obligations, if necessary. at
year-end 2005, certain debt agreements ($350 million of dealer remarketable
securities and $165million of esop debt) had ratings triggers (bbb-/baa3
or lower) that would require repayment of debt. the company currently has
aa/aa1 debt ratings. in addition, the $565 million, five-year credit agreement
requires 3m to maintain a capitalization ratio at no more than 0.60 to 1 at the
end of each quarter. this ratio is calculated as funded debt (including all
borrowed money and letters of credit utilized) to the sum of funded debt and
equity. at december 31, 2005, this ratio was approximately 0.20 to 1.
3ms cash balance at december 31, 2005 totaled $1.072
billion. 3ms strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with
significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going
forward. the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth,
including continual review of acquisition opportunities. 3m paid dividends of
$1.286 billion in 2005, and has a long history of dividend increases. in
february 2006, the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3m
common stock by 9.5% to 46 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of
$1.84 per share. in february 2006, 3ms board of directors also authorized the
purchase of up to $2.0 billion of the companys common stock between february
13, 2006 and february 28, 2007. the company may also make additional
contributions to its pension plan in the future, but exact amounts are
uncertain and will depend on market conditions.
off-balance sheet arrangements and
contractual obligations:
as of december 31, 2005, the
company had not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance
sheet financing arrangements. 3ms accrued product warranty liabilities,
recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of current and long-term
liabilities, are estimated at approximately $22 million. 3m does not consider
this amount to be material. the fair
value of 3m guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee
arrangements are not material.
in addition to guarantees, 3m, in the normal course of business,
periodically enters into agreements that require 3m to indemnify either major
customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or
property damage arising out of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel,
or claims alleging that 3m products infringe third
party patents or other intellectual property. while 3ms maximum
exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these
indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the companys
consolidated financial position or results of operations.

2005, follows:

long-term
debt payments due in 2006 include $350 million of dealer remarketable
securities (final maturity 2010) and $62 million of medium-term notes (final
maturity 2044). these securities are classified as current portion of long-term
debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments.
the next date on which investors can require repurchase of the convertible
notes is 2007, thus in the above schedule this is considered due in 2007 (final
maturity 2032).
unconditional
purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services
that is enforceable and legally binding on the company. included in the
unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations
related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and
utilities. these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with
terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms
of less than one year. many of these commitments relate to take or pay
contracts, in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or
services that are sold to customers. the company expects to receive
consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase
obligations. the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire
anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which
the company is contractually obligated. the majority of 3ms products and
services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. for this
reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the companys
expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.
as discussed in note 10 to the consolidated financial
statements, the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution
obligation for its u.s. plans in 2006. thus, company contributions to its u.s.
and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in
2006 and future years. contractual capital commitments are also included in the
preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the companys
expected capital spending in 2006 and beyond.
financial
instruments
the company enters into contractual derivative
arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency
exposure, interest rate risks and commodity price risks. a financial risk
management committee, composed of senior management, provides oversight for
risk management and derivative activities. this committee determines the
companys financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for
derivative instrument utilization. this committee also establishes procedures
for control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and
ongoing monitoring and reporting.
the company enters into foreign exchange forward
contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate
fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain
intercompany financing transactions. in 2001, the company increased the amount
and duration of its foreign currency hedges to help lessen year-over-year
impacts and to improve the predictability of future earnings. however, this
hedging program does not make 3m immune to currency impacts.
the company manages interest rate risks using a
mix of fixed and floating rate debt. to help manage borrowing costs, the
company may enter into interest rate swaps. under these arrangements, the
company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between
fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to
an agreed-upon notional principal amount. the
company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts,
price protection agreements and forward physical contracts.
a variance/co-variance statistical modeling
technique was used to test the companys exposure to changes in currency and
interest rates and assess the risk of loss in after-tax earnings of financial
instruments, derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december 31,
2005. the model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95% confidence level over a
12-month time horizon. based on this analysis of the companys interest rate
risks, possible increases in interest rates would not have a material adverse
effect on after-tax earnings ($2 million at december 31, 2005 and $5 million at
december 31, 2004). a decrease in interest rates would have increased after-tax
earnings by $2 million at december 31, 2005. based on this analysis of
the primary foreign exchange risks, possible changes in foreign exchange rates
would have adversely impacted after-tax earnings by $69 million at december 31,
2005 ($61 million at december 31, 2004). a positive change in exchange rates
would have benefited after-tax earnings by $66 million at december 31, 2005.
when including certain commodity risks, possible changes in commodity rates
would have adversely impacted after-tax earnings by an additional $4 million at
december 31, 2005 (an additional $10 million at december 31, 2004). a positive
change in commodity rates would not have materially impacted after-tax earnings
at december 31, 2005. the model used analyzed over 20 different currencies and
five commodities, but does not purport to represent what actually will be
experienced by the company. this model does not include certain hedge
transactions, because the company believes their inclusion would not materially
impact the results.
the global exposures
related to purchased components and materials are such that a one percent price
change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $45 million
per year. the global energy exposure is such that a 10% price change would
result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $35 million per year.
derivative instruments are used to hedge less than two percent of the purchased
components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10% of
this energy exposure.
forward-looking statements
this annual report on form 10-k, including managements discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7, contains
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities
litigation reform act of 1995.the company may also make forward-looking
statements in other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission,
in materials delivered to stockholders and in press releases. in addition, the companys representatives
may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.
forward-looking statements relate to future events and typically
address the companys expected future business and financial performance. words such as
plan, expect, aim, believe, project, target, anticipate, intend,
estimate, will, should, could and other words and terms of similar
meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements. in particular, these include statements about
the companys strategy for growth, product development, market position, future
performance or results of current or anticipated products, interest rates,
foreign exchange rates, financial results, and the outcome of contingencies,
such as legal proceedings. the company assumes no obligation to update or
revise any forward-looking statements.
forward-looking
statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events
and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual future results
and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in
any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors. discussion
of these factors is incorporated by reference from part i, item 1a, risk
factors, of this document, and should be considered an integral part of part
ii, item 7, managements
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures
about market risk.
in
the context of item 7a, market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from
adverse changes in financial and derivative instrument market rates and prices,
such as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. the
company discusses risk management in various places throughout this document,
including discussions in item 7 concerning financial condition and liquidity,
and financial instruments, and in the notes to consolidated financial
statements (long-term debt and short-term borrowings, derivatives and other
financial instruments, and the derivatives and hedging activities accounting
policy). all derivative activity is governed by written policies, and a value-at-risk
analysis is provided for these derivatives. the company does not have leveraged
derivative positions. however, the
company does have contingently convertible debt that, if conditions for
conversion are met, is convertible into shares of 3m common stock (refer to
note 8 in this document).

managements responsibility for financial reporting
management is responsible
for the integrity and objectivity of the financial information included in this
report. the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. where
necessary, the financial statements reflect estimates based on managements judgment.
management has established
and maintains a system of internal accounting and other controls for the
company and its subsidiaries. this system and its established accounting
procedures and related controls are designed to provide reasonable assurance
that assets are safeguarded, that the books and records properly reflect all
transactions, that policies and procedures are implemented by qualified
personnel, and that published financial statements are properly prepared and
fairly presented. the companys system of internal control is supported by
widely communicated written policies, including business conduct policies,
which are designed to require all employees to maintain high ethical standards
in the conduct of company affairs. internal auditors continually review the
accounting and control system.
3m company
managements report on internal control over financial
reporting
management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over
financial reporting. management conducted an assessment of the companys
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by
the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control  integrated framework.
based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of december 31, 2005,
the companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.
managements assessment of
the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as
of december 31, 2005, excluded cuno, which was acquired by the company in
august 2005 in a purchase business combination. cuno is a wholly-owned
subsidiary of the company whose total assets and total net sales represented
less than 10% of consolidated total assets and less than 1% of consolidated net
sales, respectively, of the company as of and for the year ended december 31,
2005. companies are allowed to exclude acquisitions from their assessment of
internal control over financial reporting during the first year of an
acquisition while integrating the acquired company under guidelines established
by the securities and exchange commission.
managements
assessment of the effectiveness of the companys internal control over
financial reporting as of december 31, 2005 has been audited by
pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered public accounting firm,
as stated in their report which is included herein.
3m
company
report of independent
registered public accounting firm
to the stockholders and board of directors of 3m
company:
we
have completed integrated audits of 3m companys 2005 and 2004 consolidated
financial statements and of its internal control over financial reporting as of
december 31, 2005, and an audit of its 2003 consolidated financial statements
in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight
board (united states). our opinions, based on our audits, are
presented below.
consolidated financial statements
in
our opinion, the consolidated financial
statements listed in the accompanying
index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position
of 3m company and its subsidiaries at december 31, 2005 and 2004, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended december 31, 2005 in conformity
with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america.
these financial statements are the responsibility of the companys management.
our responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based
on our audits. we conducted our audits of these statements in accordance with
the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states).
those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable
assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material
misstatement. an audit of financial statements includes examining, on a test
basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates
made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our
opinion.
as
discussed in note 1 to the consolidated financial statements, effective as of
december 31, 2005, the company adopted the provisions of fasb interpretation
no. 47, accounting for conditional asset retirement obligations.
internal control over financial reporting
also, in our opinion, managements assessment, included in management's
report on internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying index,
that the company maintained effective internal control over financial reporting
as of december 31, 2005 based on criteria established in internal
control - integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission (coso), is fairly stated, in all
material respects, based on those criteria. furthermore, in our opinion, the
company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over
financial reporting as of december 31, 2005, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework issued by coso. the
companys management is responsible for maintaining effective internal control
over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express
opinions on managements assessment andon the effectiveness of the
companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit. we
conducted our audit of internal control over financial reporting in accordance
with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united
states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain
reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial
reporting was maintained in all material respects. an audit of internal control over financial
reporting includes obtaining an understanding of internal control over
financial reporting, evaluating managements assessment, testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control, and performing such
other procedures as we consider necessary in the circumstances. we believe that
our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinions.
a
companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to
provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting
and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control
over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that
(i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail,
accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets
of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are
recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance
with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and
expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with
authorizations of management and directors of the company; and
(iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely
detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys
assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because
of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not
prevent or detect misstatements. also,
projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to
the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions,
or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may
deteriorate.
as
described in management's report on internal control over financial reporting
in the accompanying index, management has excluded cuno from its assessment of
internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2005, because it
was acquired by the company in a purchase business combination during 2005. we
have also excluded cuno from our audit of internal control over financial
reporting. cuno is a wholly-owned subsidiary of the company whose total assets and
total net sales represented less than 10% and less than 1%, respectively, of
the related consolidated financial statement amounts as of and for the year
ended december 31, 2005.

the accompanying notes to consolidated financial
statements are an integral part of this statement.
notes to consolidated financial statements
note 1. significant accounting
policies
consolidation: 3m is a diversified global manufacturer,
technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. all
significant subsidiaries are consolidated. all significant intercompany
transactions are eliminated. as used herein, the term 3m or company refers
to 3m company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.
foreign currency translation: local currencies generally are considered the functional
currencies outside the united states. assets and liabilities for operations in
local-currency environments are translated at year-end exchange rates. income
and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during
the year. cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity.
reclassifications: certain amounts in the prior years consolidated financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
costs of internally developed patents have been reclassified to research,
development and related expenses from selling, general and administrative
expenses. costs of internally developed patents include costs and fees
incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents.
use of estimates: the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could
differ from these estimates.
cash and cash equivalents: cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and
temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased.
investments: investments primarily include the cash surrender
value of life insurance policies, real estate not used in the business, venture
capital and equity-method investments. unrealized gains and losses relating to
investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity.
inventories: inventories are stated at lower of cost or
market, with cost generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
property, plant and equipment: property, plant and equipment, including
capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost.
depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the
straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. the
estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from 10 to
40 years, with the majority in the range of 20 to 40 years. machinery and
equipment estimated useful lives primarily range from three to 15 years, with
the majority in the range of five to 10 years. fully depreciated assets are
retained in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. upon
disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or
credited to operations. property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment
loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss to be
recorded is calculated by the excess of the assets carrying value over its
fair value. fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow
analysis.
goodwill: goodwill
is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. goodwill is not
amortized. goodwill is tested for impairment annually, and will be tested for
impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that
would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. impairment testing for
goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. reporting units are one level below
the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the
same segment have similar economic characteristics. 3m had 18 reporting units
at december 31, 2005. the majority of goodwill relates to and is assigned
directly to a specific reporting unit. an impairment loss generally would be
recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds
the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. the estimated fair value of a
reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied
by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a
discounted cash flow analysis. the company completed its annual goodwill
impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2005 and determined that no goodwill
was impaired.
intangible assets: intangible
assets include patents, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an
independent party. intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain
tradenames, are not amortized. intangible assets with a definite life are
amortized on a straight-line basis, with estimated useful lives ranging from
two to 20 years. indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment
annually, and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may
be impaired. intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate that a carrying amount of an asset
(asset group) may not be recoverable. the company has determined that no material impairments existed as of december 31,
2005. an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an
asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining the
fair value of the asset. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded is
calculated by the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value.
fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. costs
related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are
expensed as incurred, primarily in research, development and related expenses.
revenue (sales) recognition: the company sells a wide range of products to a
diversified base of customers around the world and has no material
concentration of credit risk. revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have
substantively transferred to customers. this condition normally is met when the
product has been delivered or upon performance of services. the company records estimated reductions to
revenue for customer and distributor incentives, such as rebates, at the time
of the initial sale, with these estimated reductions based on sales terms,
historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the
various markets served.
the majority of 3ms sales
agreements are for standard products and services with customer acceptance
occurring upon delivery of the product or performance of the service. 3m also
enters into agreements that contain multiple-elements (such as equipment,
installation and service) or non-standard terms and conditions. for
multiple-element arrangements, 3m recognizes revenue for delivered elements
when the delivered item has stand-alone value to the customer, fair values of
undelivered elements are known, customer acceptance of the delivered elements
has occurred, and there are only customary refund or return rights related to the
delivered elements. in addition to the preceding conditions, equipment revenue
is not recorded until the installation has been completed if equipment
acceptance is dependent upon installation, or if installation is essential to
the functionality of the equipment. installation revenues are not recorded
until installation has been completed. for prepaid service contracts, sales
revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract,
unless historical evidence indicates the costs are incurred on other than a
straight-line basis. license fee revenue is recognized as earned, with no
revenue recognized until the inception of the license term. on occasion, agreements will contain milestones,
or 3m will recognize revenue based on proportional performance. for these
agreements, and depending on the specifics, 3m may recognize revenue upon
completion of a substantive milestone, or in proportion to costs incurred to
date compared with the estimate of total costs to be incurred.
accounts receivable and allowances: trade
accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear
interest. the company maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts,
product returns and various other items. the allowance for doubtful accounts
and product returns is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable
credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated sales returns.
the company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience
by industry and regional economic data and historical sales returns. the
company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. the company does
not have any off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.
advertising and merchandising: these costs are charged to operations in the year
incurred, and totaled $457 million in 2005, $433 million in 2004 and $405
million in 2003.
research, development and related expenses: these costs are charged to operations in the year
incurred and are shown on a separate line of the consolidated statement of
income. research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research
and the application of scientific advances to the development of new and
improved products and their uses, totaled $798 million in 2005, $759 million in
2004 and $749 million in 2003. related expenses primarily include technical
support provided to customers for existing products by 3m laboratories and
internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred
to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents.
internal-use software: the company capitalizes direct costs of materials
and services used in the development of internal-use software. amounts
capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of three to
five years and are reported as a component of machinery and equipment within
property, plant and equipment.
environmental: environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by
past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are
expensed. liabilities for remediation costs are recorded on
an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable,
generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the companys
commitment to a plan of action. environmental expenditures for
capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are
capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
income taxes: the provision for income taxes is determined
using the asset and liability approach. under this approach, deferred income
taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. the
company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when
uncertainty regarding their reliability exists. as of december 31, 2005, no
valuation allowances were recorded.
earnings per share:
the difference in the weighted average shares outstanding for calculating basic
and diluted earnings per share is attributable to the dilution associated with
the companys stock-based compensation plans. certain management stock
ownership program average options outstanding during the years 2005, 2004 and
2003 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because
they would not have had a dilutive effect (15.4 million average options for
2005, 6.6 million average options for 2004 and 6.4 million average options for
2003). as discussed in note 8 to the consolidated financial statements, the conditions for conversion related to the
companys convertible notes have never been met; accordingly, there was no
impact on 3ms diluted earnings per share. if the conditions for conversion are
met, 3m may choose to pay in cash and/or common stock; however, if this
occurs, the company has the intent and ability to settle this debt security in
cash. the computations for basic and
diluted earnings per share for the years ended december 31 follow:

stock-based compensation: the company utilizes
the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion
no. 25, accounting for stock issued to employees, and generally no
compensation cost is recognized for either the general employees stock
purchase plan (gespp) or the management stock ownership program (msop). the
gespp is considered non-compensatory. in december 2002, the financial accounting
standards board (fasb) issued statement of financial accounting standards
(sfas) no. 148, accounting for stock-based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of sfas no. 123. the
company has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no. 148. refer to notes
13 and 14 for additional information concerning the gespp and msop and also
refer to additional discussion later in note 1 concerning the impact of sfas
no. 123r share based payment. pro forma amounts for stock option awards are
based on the options estimated black-scholes fair value at the date of grant,
net of tax, with expense recognition over the vesting period of the stock-based
compensation award. effective with the
may 2005 annual msop grant, the company changed its vesting period from one to
three years, which results in compensation expense under the may 2005 annual
grant being recognized over three years. the decrease in pro forma stock-based
compensation for 2005 compared with 2004 was primarily driven by this change in
vesting period. shares used in the pro forma diluted earnings per share
computation use the calculation methodology prescribed by sfas no.123,
and are thus different from the shares used for the reported diluted earnings
per share computation. pro forma amounts for stock-based compensation are as
follows:

the pro forma impact of stock-based compensation on net income and
earnings per share provided above for the years ended december 31, 2005, 2004
and 2003, were recognized over the nominal vesting period, whereby if an
employee retired before the end of the vesting period, the company would
recognize any remaining unrecognized compensation cost at the date of
retirement. sfas no. 123r requires recognition under a non-substantive vesting
period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is
eligible to retire. 3m employees in the u.s. are eligible to retire beginning
at age 55 and after having completed five years of service. approximately 25 to
30% of the number of stock-based compensation awards are made to this
population. the company will change to the non-substantive vesting period
approach for new stock compensation grants made after the companys adoption of
sfas no. 123r on january 1, 2006. therefore, primarily beginning in may 2006
with the annual msop grant, immediate expensing of those stock-based
compensation awards granted to employees eligible to retire will result in a
higher compensation expense than historically recognized in comparable prior
periods. the following table adjusts pro forma diluted earnings per share from
the above table to reflect the approximate impact of using the non-substantive
vesting period approach.

comprehensive income: total comprehensive income and the components of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the consolidated
statement of changes in stockholders equity and comprehensive income.
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency
translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international
companies), minimum pension liability adjustments, unrealized gains and losses
on available-for-sale debt and equity securities, and unrealized gains and
losses on cash flow hedging instruments.
derivatives and hedging activities: all
derivative instruments are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. the company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps,
and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with
foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. all
hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and
effective as hedges, in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting
principles. if the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes
in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are
recognized in current earnings. instruments that do not qualify for hedge
accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings.
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading
purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives. however, the
company does have contingently convertible debt that, if conditions for
conversion are met, is convertible into shares of 3m common stock (refer to
note 8 in this document).
new accounting pronouncements
as of december 31, 2005, the company adopted
fasb interpretation no. 47, accounting for conditional asset retirement
obligations (fin 47). this accounting
standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
where the liability can be reasonably estimated. conditional asset retirement
obligations exist for certain of the companys long-term assets. the fair value
of these obligations is recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis. over time the liabilities are accreted for
the change in the present value and the initial capitalized costs are
depreciated over the useful lives of the related assets. the adoption of fin 47 effective december 31,
2005, resulted in the recognition of an asset retirement obligation liability
of $59 million and an after tax charge of $35 million, which is reflected as a
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated
statement of income. the pro forma effect of applying this guidance in all
prior periods presented was determined not to be material.
in december 2004, the fasb issued sfas no. 123 (revised 2004). sfas no.
123r supersedes apb opinion no. 25.
under apb opinion no. 25, no compensation expense is recognized for
employee stock option grants if the exercise price of the companys stock option
grants is at or above the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date
of grant. sfas no. 123r requires the determination of the fair value of the
share-based compensation at the grant date and the recognition of the related
expense over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. the
original effective date for sfas no. 123r for the company was july 1, 2005.
however, on april 14, 2005, the securities and exchange commission (sec)
adopted a new rule that amends the effective dates for sfas no. 123r. the secs new rule allows companies to
implement sfas no. 123r at the beginning of their next fiscal year, instead of
the next reporting period, that begins after june 15, 2005. therefore, the
company adopted sfas no. 123r effective january 1, 2006. the company is
adopting sfas no. 123r using the modified retrospective method. all prior
periods will be adjusted to give effect to the fair-value-based method of
accounting for awards granted in fiscal years beginning on or after january 1,
1995. the 2006 impact of adopting sfas no. 123r is estimated to be
approximately $.16 per diluted share, which reflects expense for both the gespp
and msop.
in december 2004, thefasb issued fasb staff position (fsp)
no.109-2, accounting and disclosure guidance for the foreign earnings
repatriation provision within the american jobs creation act of 2004, which
provides guidance under sfas no.109, accounting for income taxes, with
respect to recording the potential impact of the repatriation provisions of the
american jobs creation act of 2004 (the jobs act) on enterprises income tax
expense and deferred tax liability. the jobs act was enacted on
october22, 2004. the jobs act creates a temporary incentive for u.s.
corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by providing an 85%
dividends received deduction for certain dividends from controlled foreign
corporations. fsp no. 109-2 states that an enterprise is allowed time beyond
the financial reporting period of enactment to evaluate the effect of the jobs
act on its plan for reinvestment or repatriation of foreign earnings for
purposes of applying sfas no.109. during 2005, the company completed its
evaluation of the repatriation provision and, in the second quarter of 2005,
recognized $75 million, net of available foreign tax credits, of related tax
liability as a result of its repatriation plan. in 2005, the company
repatriated approximately $1.8 billion of foreign earnings into the united
states pursuant to the provisions of the jobs act.
in september 2004, the fasbs emerging issues task force finalized eitf
issue no. 04-08, the effect of contingently convertible debt on diluted
earnings per share that would require the dilutive effect of shares from
contingently convertible debt to be included in the diluted earnings per share
calculation regardless of whether the contingency has been met. the company has
$616 million in aggregate face amount of 30-year zero coupon senior notes that
are convertible into approximately 5.8 million shares of common stock if
certain conditions are met. these conditions have never been met (see note 8).
in september 2005, the fasb revised its december 2003 exposure draft sfas no.
128r, earnings per
share  an amendment of fasb statement no. 128 anticipated to be
effective for fiscal periods ending after june 15, 2006. the proposed sfas no. 128r further addresses
contingently convertible debt and several other issues. unless the company
takes steps to modify certain terms of this debt security, eitf issue no. 04-08
and proposed sfas no. 128r (when effective) would result in an increase of
approximately 5.8 million shares to diluted shares outstanding to give effect
to the contingent issuance of shares. also, using the if-converted method, net
income for the diluted earnings per share calculations would be adjusted for
interest expense associated with this debt instrument. eitf issue no. 04-08
would have been effective beginning with the companys 2004 fourth quarter.
however, due to the fasbs delay in issuing sfas no. 128r and the companys
intent and ability to settle this debt security in cash versus the issuance of
stock, the impact of the additional diluted shares will not be included in the
diluted earnings per share calculation until the proposed sfas no. 128r is
effective. when sfas no. 128r is effective, prior periods diluted shares
outstanding and diluted earnings per share amounts will be restated to present
comparable information. the estimated annual reduction in the companys diluted
earnings per share would have been approximately $.02 to $.03 per share for
total year 2005, 2004 and 2003. because the impact of this standard is ongoing,
the companys
diluted shares outstanding and diluted earnings per share amounts would
be impacted until retirement or modification of certain terms of this debt
security.
note 2. acquisitions and
divestitures
the company acquired cuno on august 2, 2005. the operating results of
cuno are included in the industrial business segment. cuno is engaged in the design, manufacture
and marketing of a comprehensive line of filtration products for the
separation, clarification and purification of fluids and gases. 3m and cuno have
complementary sets of filtration technologies and the opportunity to bring an
even wider range of filtration solutions to customers around the world. 3m
acquired cuno for approximately $1.36 billion, comprised of $1.27 billion of
cash paid (net of cash acquired) and the acquisition of $80 million of debt,
most of which has been repaid.
purchased identifiable intangible assets of $268 million for the cuno
acquisition will be amortized on a straight-line basis over lives ranging from
5 to 20 years (weighted-average life of 15 years). in-process research and
development charges from the cuno acquisition were not material. pro forma
information related to this acquisition is not included because its impact on
companys consolidated results of operations is not considered to be
material. the preliminary allocation of
the purchase price is presented in the table that follows.

year 2004 acquisitions:
in february 2004, 3m (industrial business) purchased 100 percent of the
outstanding common shares of highjump software, inc., a u.s. company that
provides supply chain execution software and solutions. the total purchase
price of approximately $66 million included $23 million of cash paid (net of
cash acquired) plus 541,581 shares of 3m common stock. the 3m common stock had
a market value of $43 million at the acquisition measurement date and was
previously held as 3m treasury stock.
in march 2004, 3m (safety, security and protection services business)
purchased 91 percent of the outstanding shares of hornell holding ab, a swedish
company, for approximately $95 million, including assumption of debt. this $95
million includes $57 million of cash paid (net of cash acquired) and the acquisition
of $38 million of debt, most of which has been repaid. subsequently, 3m
acquired all of the remaining outstanding shares for approximately $6 million
in cash. hornell holding ab is a global supplier of personal protective
equipment for welding applications.
in august 2004, 3m (health care business) purchased 100 percent of the
outstanding shares of info-x inc., a u.s. company, for $17 million in cash (net
of cash acquired). the acquired company provides coding compliance software and
data for health care organizations.
purchased
identifiable intangible assets for these acquisitions are being amortized on a
straight-line basis over lives ranging from two to 20 years (weighted-average
life of 11 years). research and development charges from these acquisitions
totaled $1 million. pro forma information related to these acquisitions is not
included because the impact of these acquisitions, either individually or in
the aggregate, on the companys consolidated results of operations is not
considered to be material.
in september 2004, 3m and corning incorporated reached a settlement
related to issues associated with 3ms 2002 acquisition of corning precision
lens, inc. (now called precision optics, inc.). in september 2004, 3m received

in january 2003, 3m purchased an additional 25% interest in sumitomo 3m
limited from nec corporation for $377 million in cash. prior to this purchase,
3m controlled and owned 50% of sumitomo 3m limited and fully consolidated both
sumitomo 3m limiteds balance sheet and results of operations, with a provision
for the minority interest that did not have participating rights. as a result
of this acquisition, 3m now owns 75% of sumitomo 3m limited. sumitomo electric
industries, ltd., a japanese corporation, owns the remaining 25% of sumitomo 3m
limited. because all business segments benefit from this combination, goodwill
acquired in this acquisition was allocated to 3ms seven business segments.

the minimum pension liability
adjustment is calculated on an annual basis. if the accumulated benefit
obligation (abo) exceeds the fair value of pension assets, the employer must
recognize a liability that is at least equal to the unfunded abo. for
the year ended december31, 2004, the change from a minimum pension
liability within accumulated other comprehensive income to a prepaid pension
asset increased stockholders equity by $1.193billion (after-tax).
this increase was primarily the result of the
assets being in excess of the accumulated benefit obligation for the u.s.
qualified plan, which caused the minimum pension liability recorded for the
years ended december 31, 2003 and 2002 to be reversed. for the year ended december 31, 2005, the company remained in a prepaid
asset position for its u.s. qualified plan.
income tax effects for
cumulative translation are not significant because no tax provision has been
made for the translation of foreign currency financial statements into u.s.
dollars. reclassification adjustments are made to avoid double counting in
comprehensive income items that are also recorded as part of net income.
reclassification adjustments (other than for cash flow hedging instruments
provided in note 9 to the consolidated financial statements) were not material.

in 2005, the company recorded $75 million of
income tax provision, net of available foreign tax credits, related to the
american jobs creation act of 2004 (the jobs act), which negatively impacted
the 2005 effective worldwide tax rate by 1.5%.
the company made discretionary contributions
to its u.s. qualified pension plan of $200 million for the quarter ended
december 31, 2005, and $300 million for the quarter ended september 30, 2005.
in the quarter ended september 30, 2004, the company made a special pension
contribution to 3ms japanese pension plan of $155 million and a discretionary
contribution of $300 million to its u.s. qualified pension plan. in the third
quarter of 2003, 3m made a discretionary contribution of $600 million to its
u.s. qualified pension plan. the current income tax provision includes a benefit for the pension
contributions; the deferred tax provision includes a cost for the related
temporary difference. also in 2004, the company reversed a majority of the
minimum pension liability, which was initially recorded in 2002. the change in
the 2004 year-end deferred tax balance includes the effect of reversing this
minimum pension liability in addition to the annual provision for deferred
income tax expense.
annual
tax provisions include amounts considered sufficient to pay assessments that
may result from examination of tax returns; however, the amount ultimately paid
upon resolution of issues may differ materially from the amount accrued.
as a
result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3m,
income from manufacturing activities in certain countries is subject to reduced
tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through 2012. the
income tax benefits attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries are
estimated to be $23 million (3cents per diluted share) in 2005, $32 million
(4cents per diluted share) in 2004 and $34 million (4 cents per diluted
share) in 2003.
the company has not provided deferred taxes
on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been
considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
these earnings relate to ongoing operations and were approximately $3.5
billion as of december 31, 2005. because
of the availability of u.s. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to
determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were
not reinvested. deferred taxes are
provided for estimated u.s. and foreign incomes taxes, less available tax
credits and deductions, which may be incurred on the remittance of the companys
share of subsidiaries undistributed earnings not deemed to be permanently
reinvested.
american jobs creation act of
2004:
on october 22, 2004, the president signed the
american jobs creation act of 2004 (the jobs act). the jobs act provides a
deduction for income from qualified domestic production activities, which will
be phased in from 2005 through 2010. in return, the act also provides for a
two-year phase-out of the existing extra-territorial income exclusion (eti) for
foreign sales that was viewed to be inconsistent with international trade
protocols by the european union. uncertainty remains as to how to interpret
numerous provisions in the jobs act. at this time, the company does not expect
the net effect of the phase-out of the eti and the phase-in of this new
deduction to materially impact the effective tax rate for 2006.
the jobs act created a temporary incentive
for u.s. corporations to repatriate accumulated income earned abroad by
providing an 85% dividends received deduction for certain dividends from
controlled foreign corporations. this provided 3m the opportunity to tax
effectively repatriate foreign earnings for u.s. qualifying investments
specified by 3ms domestic reinvestment plan. during 2005, the
company completed its evaluation of the repatriation provision and, in the
second quarter of 2005, recognized $75 million, net of available foreign tax
credits, of related tax liability as a result of its repatriation plan. in
2005, the company repatriated approximately $1.8 billion of foreign earnings in
the united states pursuant to the provisions of the jobs act.

long-term debt payments due in 2006 include $350 million of dealer
remarketable securities (final maturity 2010) and $62 million of medium-term
notes (final maturity 2044). these securities are classified as current portion
of long-term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt
instruments. the next date on which investors can require the company to
repurchase the convertible notes is 2007, thus in the above schedule these
securities are considered due in 2007 (final maturity 2032).
the esop debt is serviced by dividends on stock held by the esop and by
company contributions. these contributions are not reported as interest
expense, but are reported as an employee benefit expense in the consolidated
statement of income. other borrowings includes debt held by 3ms international
companies and floating rate notes in the united states, with the long-term
portion of this debt primarily comprised of u.s. dollar floating rate debt. at
december 31, 2005, available short-term committed lines of credit globally
totaled about $618 million, of which $101 million was utilized. debt covenants
do not restrict the payment of dividends.
3m has
a medium-term notes program and shelf registration that have remaining capacity
of approximately $1.438 billion at december 31, 2005. in september 2003, the
company filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange
commission relating to the potential offering of debt securities of up to $1.5
billion. this shelf registration became effective in october 2003. in december
2003, the company established under the shelf a medium-term notes program
through which up to $1.5 billion of medium-term notes may be offered. 3m plans
to use the net proceeds from issuances of debt securities under this
registration for general corporate purposes, including the repayment of debt;
investments in or extensions of credit to 3m subsidiaries; or the financing of
possible acquisitions or business expansion. at december 31, 2004, $62 million
of medium-term notes had been issued under the medium-term notes program. no
debt was issued under this program in 2005.
3m may redeem its 30-year zero-coupon senior notes (the convertible
notes) at any time in whole or in part, beginning november 21, 2007, at the
accreted conversion price; however, bondholders may convert upon notification
of redemption into 9.4602 shares of 3m common stock. holders of the 30-year
zero-coupon senior notes have the option to require 3m to purchase their notes
at accreted value on november 21 in the years 2005, 2007, 2012, 2017, 2022 and
2027. in november 2005, 22,506 of the 639,000 in outstanding bonds were
redeemed, resulting in a payout from 3m of approximately $20 million. this
reduced the convertible notes face value at maturity to $616 million, which
equates to a book value of approximately $539 million at december 31, 2005. as
disclosed in a form 8-k in november 2005, 3m amended the terms of these
securities to pay cash at a rate of 2.40% per annum of the principal amount at
maturity of the companys convertible notes, which equates to 2.75% per annum
of the notes' accreted value on november21, 2005. the cash interest
payments will be made semiannually in arrears on may 22, 2006, november 22,
2006, may 22, 2007 and november 22, 2007 to holders of record on the 15th
calendar day preceding each such interest payment date.
3m originally sold $639 million in aggregate face amount of these convertible
notes on november 15, 2002, which are convertible into shares of 3m common
stock. the gross proceeds from the offering, to be used for general corporate
purposes, were $550 million ($540 million net of issuance costs). debt issuance
costs were amortized on a straight-line basis over a three-year period
beginning in november 2002. on february 14, 2003, 3m registered these
convertible notes in a registration statement filed with the securities and
exchange commission. the terms of the convertible notes include a yield to
maturity of .50% and an initial conversion premium of 40% over the $65.00
(split-adjusted) closing price of 3m common stock on november 14, 2002. if
certain conditions for conversion (relating to the closing common stock prices
of 3m exceeding the conversion trigger price for specified periods) are met,
holders may convert each of the 30-year zero-coupon senior notes into 9.4602
shares of 3m common stock in any calendar quarter commencing after march 31,
2003. the conversion trigger price for the fourth quarter of 2005 was $120.00
per share. if the conditions for conversion are met, and 3m elects not to
settle in cash, the 30-year zero-coupon senior notes will be convertible in the
aggregate into approximately 5.8 million shares of 3m common stock. 3m may
choose to pay the redemption purchase price in cash and/or common stock;
however, if redemption occurs, the company has the intent and ability to settle
this debt security in cash. the conditions for conversion have never been met;
accordingly, there has been no impact on 3ms diluted earnings per share. for a
discussion of accounting pronouncements that will affect accounting treatment
for the convertible note, refer to note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements for discussion of eitf issue no. 04-08, the effect of
contingently convertible debt on diluted earnings per share and proposed sfas
no. 128r, earnings per share.
in december 2005, the companys $350 million of dealer remarketable
securities were remarketed for one year. they were reissued with a fixed coupon
rate of5.65%. these securities, which are classified as current portion
of long-term debt, were issued in december 2000. the remarketable securities
can be remarketed annually, at the option of the dealer, for a year each time,
with a final maturity date of december 2010.
note 9. derivatives and other
financial instruments
the company
uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, and forward and option contracts to
manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and
commodity market volatility. the information that follows explains the various
types of derivatives and financial instruments, and includes a table that
recaps cash flow hedging amounts.
foreign currency forward and option contracts: the company enters into foreign exchange forward
contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate
fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain
intercompany financing transactions. these transactions are designated as cash flow
hedges. at december 31, 2005, the company had various open foreign exchange
forward and option contracts, the majority of which had maturities of one year
or less. the amounts at risk are not material because the company has the
ability to generate offsetting foreign currency cash flows. the settlement or
extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications to earnings in
the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings (from other
comprehensive income). the maximum length of time over which 3m is hedging its
exposure to the variability in future cash flows for a majority of the
forecasted transactions, excluding those forecasted transactions related to the
payment of variable interest on existing financial instruments, is 12 months.
based on exchange rates at december 31, 2005, the company expects to reclassify
to earnings over the next 12 months a majority of the cash flow hedging
instruments after-tax gain of $38
million (with the impact largely offset by foreign currency cash flows from
underlying hedged items). hedge
ineffectiveness was not material for the years 2005, 2004 and 2003. amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) related to cash flow hedging instruments follow.

interest rate and currency swaps: the company manages interest expense using a mix
of fixed and floating rate debt. to help manage borrowing costs, the company
may enter into interest rate swaps. under these arrangements, the company
agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and
floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional
principal amount. the company uses interest rate and currency swaps to manage
interest rate risk related to borrowings.
at december 31,
2005, the company did not have any interest rate swaps designated as fair value
hedges of underlying fixed rate obligations. the fair value of swaps at
december 31, 2004 was $3 million. the mark-to-market of these fair value hedges
is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or
loss on the underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense.
these fair value hedges are 100% effective and, thus, there is no impact on
earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.
as circumstances
warrant, the company also uses cross-currency interest rate swaps to hedge
foreign currency and interest rates. as part of this strategy, in september 2003, the company entered into a
three-year combined interest rate and currency swap with a notional amount of
$300 million. this transaction is a partial hedge of 3ms net investment in 3ms
japanese subsidiaries. this swap converts a variable rate u.s. dollar exposure
to a variable rate yen-denominated exposure.
net investment hedging: as circumstances warrant, the company uses foreign currency debt and
forwards to hedge portions of the companys net investments in foreign
operations. for hedges that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains
or losses are recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive
income, with any ineffectiveness recorded in cost of sales. the unrealized gain
recorded in cumulative translation at december 31, 2005 was $47 million and the
unrealized gain at december 31, 2004 was $5 million. at december 31, 2003, this
amount was not material. hedge ineffectiveness was not material in 2005, 2004
and 2003.
commodity price management: the company manages commodity price risks through
negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical
contracts. the company uses commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of forecasted
transactions to manage price volatility. the related mark-to-market gain or
loss on qualifying hedges is included in other comprehensive income to the
extent effective (typically 100% effective), and reclassified into cost of
sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 3m
has hedged its exposure to the variability of future cash flows for certain
forecasted transactions through 2008. no significant commodity cash flow hedges
were discontinued during the years 2005, 2004 and 2003.
currency
effects: 3m estimates that year-on-year currency
effects, including hedging impacts, increased net income by $115 million in
2005, $181 million in 2004, and $73 million in 2003. this estimate includes the
effect of translating profits from local currencies into u.s. dollars; the
impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations
in the united states and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including
derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.
3m estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and
losses increased net income by $50 million in 2005 and $48 million in 2004. 3m
estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses decreased
net income by $73 million in 2003.
credit risk: the company is exposed to credit loss in the
event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency
swaps, and option and foreign exchange contracts. however, the companys risk
is limited to the fair value of the instruments. the company actively monitors
its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit
limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions
as counterparties. the company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of
these counterparties.
fair value of financial instruments: at december 31, 2005
and 2004, the companys financial instruments included cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, investments, accounts payable, borrowings,
and derivative contracts. the fair values of cash and cash equivalents,
accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings and current
portion of long-term debt (except the $350 million dealer remarketable
security) approximated carrying values because of the short-term nature of
these instruments. available-for-sale investments and derivative contracts are
reported at fair values. fair values for investments held at cost are not
readily available, but are estimated to approximate fair value. the carrying

note 10. pension and postretirement benefit plans
3m has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering
substantially all u.s. employees and many employees outside the united states.
pension benefits associated with these plans generally are based on each participants
years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. in
addition to providing pension benefits, the company provides certain
postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all of
its u.s. employees who reach retirement age while employed by the company. most
international employees and retirees are covered by government health care
programs. the cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for
international employees is not material and is combined with u.s. amounts.
the companys pension funding policy is to deposit with independent
trustees amounts allowable by law. trust funds and deposits with insurance
companies are maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and
their beneficiaries. there are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to
its nature. for its u.s. postretirement plan, the company has set aside amounts
at least equal to annual benefit payments with an independent trustee.
on december 8,
2003, the medicare prescription drug improvement and modernization act of 2003
(the medicare act) was signed into law. the act expands medicare to include
coverage for prescription drugs. 3m sponsors medical programs, including
prescription drug coverage for u.s. retirees. on may 19, 2004, the fasb issued
fsp no. 106-2, accounting and disclosure requirements related to the medicare
prescription drug, improvement and modernization act of 2003, which requires
current recognition of the federal subsidy that employers may receive for
providing drug coverage to retirees. fsp no. 106-2 was effective for the
company july 1, 2004. the company remeasured its plans assets and accumulated
postretirement benefit obligation (apbo) as of june 30, 2004 to include the
effects of the medicare act. the medicare act reduced the apbo by $240 million,
which was partially offset by an increase to the apbo of $170 million as a
result of the plan remeasurement. the net impact to the apbo was a reduction of
$70 million.
in 2004, the companys u.s. plan measurement date was changed from
september 30 to december 31. information presented in the tables for u.s. plans
for 2005 and 2004 reflects a measurement date of december 31, and for 2003 a
measurement date of september 30. the primary reasons for this change include
consistency between the u.s. and international measurement dates, the increased
clarity that results from having the same measurement and balance sheet dates,
and administrative simplification. this change did not have a material impact
on the determination of periodic pension cost or pension obligations.
the company completed the acquisition of cuno during the third quarter
of 2005. cuno has several u.s. plans and an international pension plan. the
u.s. plans had a combined projected benefit obligation of $53 million and plan
assets of $42 million as of august 1, 2005. the international pension plan had
a projected benefit obligation of $13 million and plan assets of $10 million as
of august 1, 2005. these plans are included in the balances of the appropriate
u.s. and international categories in the tables that follow.

as of december 31, 2005, the company converted to the rp (retirement
plans) 2000 mortality table for calculating the year-end 2005 u.s. pension and
postretirement obligations and 2006 expense. the impact of this change
increased the year-end 2005 u.s. projected benefit obligations for pension by
$385 million, the year-end 2005 u.s. accumulated benefit obligations for
pension by $349 million and the 2005 u.s. accumulated postretirement benefit
obligation by $93 million. this change
will also increase pension expenses for 2006 by $64 million and postretirement
expenses by $17 million.

3ms investment strategy for its pension and postretirement plans is to
manage the plans on a going-concern basis. the primary goal of the funds is to
meet the obligations as required. the secondary goal is to earn the highest
rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without
subjecting the company to an undue amount of contribution rate volatility. fund
returns are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent
possible within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset
limits, thus reducing the level of contributions 3m must make.
3m does not buy or sell any of its own stock as a direct investment for
its pension and other postretirement benefit funds. however, due to external
investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold
3m stock. the aggregate amount of the shares would not be considered to be
material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.
for the u.s. pension plan, the companys assumption for the expected
return on plan assets was 8.75% in 2005. projected returns are based primarily
on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking
estimates of active investment management. the companys expected long-term
rate of return on u.s. plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption
of 44% u.s. and 15% international equities, with an expected
long-term rate of return of 7.8% for both u.s. and international
equities; 13% private equities with an expected long-term rate of return of
12.8%; 28% fixed-income securities with an expected long-term rate of return of
4.5%; and an additional rate of return of 1.3% from active investment
management. these assumptions result in an 8.75% expected rate of return on an
annualized basis. the plan assets earned a rate of return in excess of 10%, 13%
and 18% in 2005, 2004 and 2003, respectively. the average annual actual return
on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been 10.2% and 12.2%,
respectively.

in 2005, the
company made discretionary contributions totaling $500 million to its u.s.
qualified pension plan, with $200 million contributed in the fourth quarter of
2005, and $300 million contributed in the third quarter of 2005. in the third
quarter of 2005, the company also transferred a portion of its sumitomo 3m
japanese pension liabilities and assets to the government, as allowed by a
japanese government program. this program allowed 3m to
transfer $145
million in pension liabilities and $74 million in pension assets to the
japanese government. the company
remeasured its projected benefit obligation and plan assets as of august 15,
2005, to include the effect of this transfer. as a result of the remeasurement,
the company recognized a gain of $8 million. the gain partially offsets the
2005 net periodic benefit cost.
in 2006, the company expects to contribute an amount in the range of
$100 million to $400 million to its u.s. and international pension plans, and
approximately $100 million to its post-retirement plans. the company does not
have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in
2006. therefore, the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could
vary significantly depending on the u.s. plans funding status as of the 2006
measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution.

capital and operating leases:
rental expense under operating leases was $195 million in 2005, $181
million in 2004 and $162 million in 2003. it is 3ms practice to secure renewal
rights for leases, thereby giving 3m the right, but not the obligation, to
maintain a presence in a leased facility. 3ms primary capital lease, which
became effective in april 2003, involves a building in the united kingdom (with
a lease term of 22 years). during the second quarter of 2003, 3m recorded a
capital lease asset and obligation of approximately 33.5 million united kingdom
pounds (approximately $58 million at december 31, 2005 exchange rates). minimum
lease payments under capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms in

warranties/guarantees:
3ms accrued
product warranty liabilities, recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as

other guarantee arrangements are not material.
related party activity:
purchases from related parties (largely
related to companies in which 3m has an equity interest) totaled approximately
$141 million in 2005 ($124 million in 2004 and $113 million in 2003).
receivables due from related parties (largely related to receivables from
employees for relocation and other ordinary business expense advances) totaled
approximately $37 million in 2005 ($34 million in 2004 and $44 million in
2003). 3m sales to related parties totaled approximately $5 million in 2005
($91 million in 2004 and $96 million in 2003). indebtedness to 3m from related
parties was not material in 2005, 2004 and 2003.
legal proceedings:
the company and some of its
subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the
united states, and regulatory proceedings worldwide. these include various
products liability (involving products that the company now or formerly
manufactured and sold), intellectual property, and commercial claims and
lawsuits, including those brought under the antitrust laws, and environmental
proceedings. the following sections first describe the significant legal
proceedings in which the company is involved, and then describe the liabilities
and associated insurance receivables the company has accrued relating to its
significant legal proceedings. unless otherwise stated, the company is
vigorously defending all such litigation.
antitrust litigation
as previously reported, lepages inc., a
transparent tape competitor of 3m, filed a lawsuit against the company in june
1997 alleging that certain marketing practices of the company constituted
unlawful monopolization under the antitrust laws. following the entry of a verdict in lepages favor and appellate rulings
sustaining that verdict, direct and indirect tape purchasers filed a number of
purported class actions and individual actions against the company in various
state and federal courts. these cases allege that the company competed unfairly
and unlawfully monopolized alleged markets for transparent tape, and they seek
injunctive relief and to recover on behalf of variously defined classes of
direct and indirect purchasers damages in the form of price overcharges the
company allegedly charged for these products.
indirect purchaser antitrust litigation
in december 2005, the federal court in california granted preliminary
approval of the previously disclosed settlement agreement of twelve
tape-related class actions brought on behalf of indirect purchasers who did not
purchase tape for resale. the final approval hearing is currently scheduled for
april 2006. the company also entered into an agreement in the fourth quarter of
2005 to resolve two other cases involving indirect purchases not for resale
originally brought as class actions in state courts in massachusetts and
florida. the complaints in those cases were amended to reflect the same
products as those in the california federal class action and will be dismissed
and the settlement agreement will be effective once the settlement of the
twelve class actions is given final court approval and after securing state
court approval where necessary.
direct purchaser antitrust litigation
in november 2005, the company agreed to
settle three of the four pending direct purchaser transparent tape antitrust
cases two individual actions and a purported class action on behalf of direct
purchasers of both 3m branded and private label tape. if the settlement agreement executed by the
parties to the purported class action receives federal court approval and all
conditions in the agreement are satisfied, the settlement will terminate the
purported class action and release the claims of the affected putative class
members nationwide. the settlements of the two individual actions are subject
to the parties signing a settlement agreement but are not conditioned on court
approval. the proposed class action settlement does not affect the certified
class action brought by direct purchasers of 3m transparent and invisible tape
(but not private label tape) that is pending in a federal court in pennsylvania
and does not constitute any admission of liability by the company. the court
has scheduled trial of that action to commence in late spring of this year.
breast implant litigation
the company and certain other companies were named as
defendants in past years in numerous claims and lawsuits alleging damages for
personal injuries of various types resulting from breast implants formerly
manufactured by the company or a related company. the vast majority of claims
against the company have been resolved. the company does not consider its
remaining probable liability to be material.
information concerning the associated insurance receivable and legal
proceedings related to it follows in the paragraph entitled breast implant insurance receivables.
respirator mask/asbestos
litigation
for more than 25 years, the
company has defended and resolved the claims of over 370,000 individual
claimants alleging injuries from occupational dust exposures. as of december
31, 2005, the company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in
numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately
48,600 individual claimants, a decrease from the approximately 76,600
individual claimants with actions pending at december 31, 2004.
the vast majority of the
lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the company
allege use of some of the companys mask and respirator products and seek
damages from the company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from
workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts,
found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the
workplace. the remaining claimants generally allege personal injury from
occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the
company, which are often unspecified, and by other defendants, or occasionally
at company premises.
in many of these lawsuits and
claims, the company is named as a defendant with multiple co-defendants where
no product the company manufactured is identified or where the company is
ultimately determined not to have manufactured the products identified by the
plaintiffs. the companys vigorous defense of this litigation has resulted in:
(i) dismissals of many lawsuits without any payment by the company; (ii) an
average settlement value of less than $1,000 per claimant for all of the claims
and lawsuits that the company has resolved, including those dismissed without
payment; and (iii) jury verdicts for the company in six of the seven cases
tried to verdict (such trials occurred in 1999, 2000, 2003 and 2004), and an
appellate reversal in 2005 of the one jury verdict adverse to the company.
plaintiffs have asserted
specific dollar claims for damages in approximately 59% of the 9,685 lawsuits
that were pending against the company at the end of 2005 in all jurisdictions.
a majority of states restrict or prohibit specifying damages in tort cases such
as these, and most of the remaining jurisdictions do not require such
specification. in those cases in which plaintiffs choose to assert specific
dollar amounts in their complaints, brought in states that permit such
pleading, the amounts claimed are typically not meaningful as an indicator of
the companys potential liability. this
is because (a) the amounts claimed typically bear no relation to the extent of
the plaintiffs injury, if any; (b) the complaints nearly always assert claims
against multiple defendants, with the typical complaint asserting claims
against an average of 75 different defendants, the damages alleged are not
attributed to individual defendants, and a defendants share of liability may
turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, and by
the amount of fault a jury allocates to each defendant if a case is ultimately
tried before a jury; (c) many cases are filed against the company even though
the plaintiffs did not use any of the companys products and, ultimately, are
withdrawn or dismissed without any payment; and (d) many cases are brought on
behalf of plaintiffs who have not suffered any medical injury, and, ultimately,
are resolved without any payment or a payment that is a small fraction of the
damages initially claimed. of the 5,741 pending cases in which purported damage
amounts are specified in the complaints, six cases involve claims of an
unstated amount and also allege punitive damage claims of $1 million; 4,098
cases involve claims of $100,000 or less (five of these cases also allege
punitive damages of $10,000, and one alleges punitive damages of $75,000), 229
cases involve claims between $100,000 and $3 million (83 of these cases also
each allege punitive damages of $250,000, one of them also alleges punitive
damages of $1 million, 45 of them also each allege punitive damages of $1.5
million, and 76 of them each allege punitive damages of $2.5 million), 31 cases
involve claims of $7.5 million, one case has claims of $8.65 million, 1,352
cases involve claims of $10 million (one of these cases also alleges punitive
damages of $350,000, one of them also alleges $15 million in punitive damages,
and 1,285 of them also allege an equal amount in punitive damages), 19 cases
involve claims of $15 million (2 of these cases also each allege an equal
amount in punitive damages), three cases involve claims of $20 million (all of
which also allege an equal amount in punitive damages), and two cases involve
claims of $50 million (one of which also alleges punitive damages of $50
million). some complaints allege that the compensatory and punitive damages are
at least the amounts specified. as
previously stated, the company has more than 25 years of experience in
defending litigation of this type, has resolved the claims of over 370,000
individuals with a cumulative average settlement amount of less than $1,000 per
claimant, and based on this experience and for the other reasons cited,
believes that the damage amounts specified in complaints are not a meaningful
factor in any assessment of the companys potential liability.
as previously reported, the
state of west virginia, through its attorney general, filed a complaint in 2003
against the company and two other manufacturers of respiratory protection
products in the circuit court of lincoln county, west virginia. the complaint
seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for
reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the state for workers
compensation and healthcare benefits provided to more than 20,000 current or
former miners allegedly suffering from silicosis and/or coal miners
pneumoconiosis (black lung disease) and unspecified punitive
damages. in october 2005, the state
of west virginia filed an amended complaint seeking reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the state for workers
compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with
occupational pneumoconiosis in all
professions, not just to coal miners as the original complaint alleged.
employment litigation
as previously reported, one
current and one former employee of the company filed a purported class action
in the district court of ramsey county, minnesota in december 2004, seeking to
represent a class of all current and certain former salaried employees employed
by 3m in minnesota below a certain salary grade who were age 46 or older at
any time during the applicable
period to be determined by the court. the complaint alleges the plaintiffs
suffered various forms of employment discrimination on the basis of age in
violation of the minnesota human rights act and seeks injunctive relief,
unspecified compensatory (up to triple actual damages) and punitive damages in
excess of $50,000, including back and front pay and attorneys fees. in january 2006, the plaintiffs filed a
motion to join four additional plaintiffs.
a similar age discrimination
purported class action was filed against the company in november 2005 in the
superior court of essex county, new jersey on behalf of a class of new
jersey-based employees of the company. the company removed this case to the
united states district court for the district of new jersey. in addition, three
former employees filed age discrimination charges against the company with the
u.s. equal employment opportunity commission and the pertinent state agencies
in texas, minnesota and california, during 2005. such filings include
allegations that the release of claims signed by certain former employees in
the purported class defined in the charges is invalid for various reasons. the
same law firm represents the plaintiffs and claimants in each of these
proceedings.
environmental matters and
litigation
the companys operations are
subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air
emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic substances, and the handling and
disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state and local
authorities around the world, and private parties in the united states and
abroad. these laws and regulations provide, under certain circumstances, a
basis for the remediation of contamination and for personal injury and property
damage claims. the company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and
capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending
personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business
operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. in its effort to
satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws
and regulations, the company has established, and periodically updates,
policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations
worldwide.
remediation: under certain environmental laws, including the
united states comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability
act of 1980 and similar state laws, the company may be jointly and severally
liable, typically with other companies, for the costs of environmental
contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations. the
company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in the united states,
at which it may have some liability. please refer to the following
section, accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal
proceedings for more information on this subject.
regulatory
activities: as
previously reported, the company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing
reviews by local, state, national (primarily the u.s. environmental protection
agency (epa)), and international agencies of possible environmental and health
effects of perfluorooctanyl compounds (perflurooctanoic acid or pfoa and
perfluorooctane sulfonate or pfos). as a result of its phase-out decision in
may 2000, the company no longer manufactures perfluorooctanyl compounds except
that a subsidiary recovers and recycles pfoa for internal use in production
processes.
in
january, 2006, the epa announced a voluntary initiative under which eight
companies, including the company and its subsidiary referenced above, would
commit to reduce emissions and product content of pfoa by 95% by 2010 over
levels in 2000, and to commit to working toward the elimination of pfoa from
emissions and products by 2015. the company having decided to phase out of
perfluorooctanyl chemistry in 2000 is well positioned to comply with these
objectives.
in january 2005, the epa issued
a draft risk assessment for pfoa and submitted it for review to the epa science
advisory board. the epa document expresses the epas preliminary assessment in
terms of the margin of exposure between the levels of that compound that cause
adverse health effects in laboratory animals and the levels found in human
blood sera in the u.s. population. a panel convened by the
science advisory board issued a draft report in june 2005 and a revised draft in
january 2006. the science board has conditionally approved the revised draft of
the panel, which among other things recommended that epa classify pfoa under
the epa's hazard descriptor of "likely to be carcinogenic to humans."
the selection by the panel of this descriptor was based upon the conclusion of
some panel members that data from two studies show that pfoa is a multisite
carcinogen in rats. the company disagrees with this classification since the
panel did not consider other important data. a final report is expected to be
prepared and submitted to the epa, which in turn will make a final risk
assessment based on the report and additional data not considered by the
science advisory board. in january 2006, the epa stated that to date it
"is not aware of any studies specifically relating current levels of pfoa
exposure to human health effects.
the epa signed a memorandum of
understanding with the company and dyneon llc, a subsidiary of the company, in
october 2004, under which the company is monitoring the potential presence of
pfoa at and around the
companys manufacturing facility in decatur,
alabama. activities are in progress pursuant to this memorandum of
understanding.
regulatory activities concerning pfoa and/or
pfos continue in europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies.
these activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk
assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches, including a proposal
now pending before the european union parliament to implement a marketing and
use directive to regulate pfos.
the company has been cooperating with the process to review whether
pfos meets the criteria under the protocol for persistent organic pollutants (pops
protocol). this protocol is part of an international treaty known as the
convention on long-range transboundary air pollution (lrtap). in december of
2005, the executive body comprised of parties to the protocol decided that the
record generated under the protocol review process was sufficient to determine that
pfos qualifies as a pop and that the review process should now proceed to a track
b review focused on the economic impacts and other aspects of adding pfos to
the protocol. the united states, which has signed but not yet ratified this
protocol, indicated its disagreement with the executive body decision. pfos
also has been nominated for addition to another international treaty focused on
pops known as the stockholm convention. a process to prepare a risk profile for
pfos is now proceeding under that convention.
the company and state agencies
tested groundwater in 2004 and 2005 beneath three former waste disposal sites
in washington county, minnesota, used many years ago by companies with which
the company contracted to dispose of waste containing perfluorooctanyl
compounds. the test results show that water from certain municipal wells in
oakdale, minnesota near two of the former disposal sites and some private wells
in that vicinity in lake elmo, minnesota contain low levels of pfos and pfoa.
the minnesota pollution control agency is providing carbon filters for a small
number of private wells in lake elmo measuring above a level established by the
minnesota department of health. no
perfluorooctanyl compounds have been detected in wells in the vicinity of the
third former disposal site in washington county. the company has provided the
test results from these private and municipal wells in lake elmo and oakdale to
the epa. on its own initiative, the
company proposed and has reached an agreement with the city of oakdale under
which the company will at its own expense construct, operate and maintain for
at least five years a granular activated carbon water treatment system to treat
one or more of oakdales municipal wells. the company donated several acres of
land to the city of lake elmo, minnesota for a water tower and granted the city
approximately $3.3 million that the city will use to expand municipal water
service to neighborhoods that include a small number of private wells in which
levels of pfos and pfoa have been detected.
the company markets its newly
reformulated scotchgard products
(that replace the formulations from which the company began its phase-out in
2000), pursuant to a consent agreement with the epa that requires extensive
health and environmental effects testing of the base chemistry underlying such
products, most of which has been completed. the epa has not yet issued the
anticipated hazard assessment of that health and environmental effects testing
for the reformulated scotchgard
products.
the company cannot predict what
regulatory actions arising from the foregoing proceedings and activities, if
any, may be taken regarding such compounds or the consequences of any such
actions.
litigation: a former employee filed a purported class action lawsuit in 2002 in
the circuit court of morgan county, alabama involving perfluorooctanyl
chemistry. the lawsuit seeks unstated compensatory and punitive damages and
alleges that the plaintiffs suffered fear, increased risk, sub clinical
injuries and property damage from exposure to perfluorooctanyl chemistry at or
near the companys decatur, alabama, manufacturing facility. the complaint also
alleges that the company acted improperly with respect to disclosures to
workers concerning such chemistry. the circuit
court in 2005 granted the companys motion to dismiss the named plaintiffs
personal injury-related claims on the basis that such claims are barred by the
exclusivity provisions of the states workers compensation act. also in 2005,
the judge in a second purported class action lawsuit (filed by three residents
of morgan county, alabama seeking unstated compensatory and punitive damages
involving alleged damage to their property from emissions of perfluorooctanyl
compounds from the companys decatur, alabama, manufacturing facility that
formerly produced those compounds) granted the companys motion to abate the
case, effectively putting the case on hold pending the resolution of class
certification issues in the action described above filed in the same court in
2002.
six residents of washington county, minnesota, filed in
october 2004 a purported class action in the district court of washington
county on behalf of washington county residents whose property has allegedly
been harmed and who have allegedly suffered personal injury from alleged
emissions from the former perfluorooctanyl production facility at cottage
grove, minnesota. the lawsuit seeks unspecified damages in
excess of $50,000 per plaintiff and class member. after the district
court granted the companys motion to dismiss the claims for medical monitoring
and public nuisance in april 2005, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint
adding additional allegations involving other perfluoronated compounds
manufactured by the company, alleging additional legal theories in support of
their
claims, and seeking relief based on alleged
contamination of the city of oakdale municipal water supply and certain private
wells in the vicinity of lake elmo, minnesota. pretrial proceedings are in
progress and a hearing on plaintiffs motion to certify the action as a class
action has been scheduled by the court for the fall of 2006.
several hundred plaintiffs who
claim to have lived in the vicinity of the acme barrel companys storage drum
reconditioning facility in chicago, illinois, filed a lawsuit in the third
quarter of 2003 in the circuit court of cook county, illinois, against 3m and a
number of other companies that allegedly were customers of acme barrel. the
complaint seeks unspecified damages for personal injuries allegedly caused by
the plaintiffs exposure to chemicals migrating from acme barrels drum
reconditioning operations. the plaintiffs also assert that a class should be
certified on behalf of all persons similarly situated. a separate wrongful
death lawsuit was filed in the circuit court of cook county, illinois, against
3m and a number of other companies on behalf of the estate and family of a
person who worked at the cook county juvenile detention center in the vicinity
of the acme barrel facility. the lawsuit alleges unspecified damages from
personal injuries and death allegedly caused by exposure to chemicals migrating
from acme barrels drum reconditioning operations.
accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to
legal proceedings
the company complies with the
requirements of statement of financial accounting standards no. 5, accounting
for contingencies, and related guidance, and records liabilities for legal
proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of
the loss and where liability is probable.
where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the
company records the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the
range if there is no one best estimate. the company either discloses the amount
of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established reserves if
estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. for those insured
matters where the company has taken a reserve, the company also records
receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the
companys insurance program. for those insured matters where the company has
not taken a reserve because the liability is not probable or the amount of the
liability is not estimable, or both, but where the company has incurred an
expense in defending itself, the company records receivables for the amount of
insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred. the company
discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or
the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the company believes
there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.
because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and
unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that
the company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded
liabilities. a future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development
could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the
companys results of operations or cash flows in the period in which they are
recorded. the company currently believes that such future charges, if any,
would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position
of the company, taking into account its significant available insurance
coverage. based on experience and developments, the company periodically
reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and
receivables, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously
determined to be not estimable and/or not probable. where appropriate, the
company makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. as a
result, the current estimates of the potential impact on the companys
consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the
legal proceedings and claims pending against the company could change in the
future.
the company estimates insurance
receivables based on an analysis of its numerous policies, including their
exclusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its experience
with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim, and records an
amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered.
the following table shows the major
categories of ongoing claims for which the company has been able to estimate
its probable liability and for which the company has taken reserves and the
related insurance receivables:

for
those significant pending legal proceedings that do not appear in the table and
that are not the subject of pending settlement agreements, the company has
determined that liability is not probable or
the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, and the company is
unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss at this time. the amounts
in the preceding table with respect to breast implant and environmental
remediation represent the companys best estimate of the respective
liabilities. the company has recorded liabilities with respect to the two
pending transparent tape antitrust class action settlements.
breast implant insurance receivables: as of december 31, 2005, the
company had receivables for insurance recoveries related to the breast implant
matter of $130 million, representing amounts covered by the minnesota supreme
courts ruling of august 2003 but yet to be received and other amounts that
have been claimed from various reinsurers, the minnesota insurance guaranty
association, and the estates of certain insolvent insurance carriers. the company received about $92 million in the
fourth quarter of 2005 (bringing total recoveries in 2005 to $148 million),
offsetting a portion of the previously recorded receivable, pursuant to
settlements with seven insurers and one reinsurer that were consistent with the
companys overall expectation of recovery as a result of the minnesota supreme
court ruling. with these recent settlements and the previously disclosed
settlements, 17 of the 29 insurers have withdrawn from the pending proceedings
and have settled the companys claims under the minnesota supreme court
decision. various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of the
balance of the companys insurance receivables, including (i) additional delays
in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii) the extent to which insurers may
become insolvent in the future, and (iii) the outcome of the pending legal
proceedings involving the insurers.
respirator mask/asbestos liabilities and
insurance receivables: the company estimates its
respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, including the cost to resolve the claim
and defense costs, by examining: (i) the companys experience in resolving
claims, (ii) apparent trends, (iii) the apparent quality of claims (e.g., the company believes many of the claims have been asserted on behalf of asymptomatic claimants),
(iv) changes in the nature and mix of claims (e.g.,
the proportion of claims asserting usage of the companys mask or respirator
products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica or other
occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products
allegedly manufactured by the company), (v) the number of current claims and a
projection of the number of future asbestos and other claims that may be filed
against the company, (vi) the cost to resolve recently settled claims, and
(vii) an estimate of the cost to resolve and defend against current and future
claims. because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims
that have not yet been asserted, particularly with respect to the companys
respiratory products that themselves did not contain any harmful materials
(which makes the various published studies that purport to project future
asbestos claims substantially removed from the companys principal experience
and which themselves vary widely), the company does not believe that there is
any single best estimate of this liability, nor that it can reliably estimate
the amount or range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the reserve
the company has established. no liability
has been recorded regarding the pending action brought by the west
virginia attorney general previously described.
developments may occur that could affect the
companys estimate of its liabilities. these developments include, but are not
limited to, significant changes in (i) the number of future claims, (ii) the
average cost of resolving claims, (iii) the legal costs of defending these
claims and in maintaining trial readiness, (iv) changes in the mix and nature
of claims received, (v) trial and appellate outcomes, (vi) changes in the law
and procedure applicable to these claims, and (vii) the financial viability of
other co-defendants and insurers. congress is currently considering legislation
that would terminate essentially all litigation related to asbestos (but not
other occupational dusts) in exchange for substantial annual payments by the
defendant companies and their insurers and, accordingly, such legislation, if
enacted, would bring considerable certainty to the assessment of the companys
future asbestos-related liability; the company supports such legislation in
principle, although enactment of the proposed legislation could cause the
company to record substantial additional liabilities.
as a result of the costs of aggressively
defending itself, the company increased its reserves in the
second quarter of 2005 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $30 million.
as of december 31, 2005, the company had reserves for respirator mask/asbestos
liabilities of $210 million.
as of december 31, 2005, the
company had receivables for insurance recoveries related to the respirator
mask/asbestos litigation of $447 million. the company increased its receivables
in the second quarter of 2005 for insurance recoveries related to respirator
mask/asbestos litigation by $15 million and received payments under the companys
insurance program of $5 million in the fourth quarter of 2005 (bringing the
total recoveries in 2005 to $32 million). while the company has substantial
remaining claims-made and occurrence (pre-1986) insurance coverage, as
previously disclosed this additional receivable represents a lower percentage
of the additional liability than was the case with receivables recorded prior
to 2004 primarily because of varying degrees of prior settlements with the companys
insurers, insolvencies of certain insurers, uncertainties concerning the
precise manner of assigning
particular costs to specific
policies, potential exhaustion of policies, and the types of claims asserted.
various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of this
receivable, including (i) delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii)
the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future, and (iii) the
outcome of negotiations with insurers and possible legal proceedings, if
necessary, with respect to respirator mask/asbestos liability insurance
coverage.
the difference between the
accrued liability and insurance receivable represents in part the time delay
between payment of claims and recording of liability (including with respect to
projected future claims) on the one hand and receipt of insurance
reimbursements on the other hand. because of the lag time between settlement
and payment of a claim, no meaningful conclusions may be drawn from quarterly
changes in the amount of receivables for expected insurance recoveries and the
quarterly changes in the number of claimants at the end of each quarter.
environmental
liabilities and insurance receivables: as of
december 31, 2005, the company had recorded liabilities of $30 million for
estimated environmental remediation costs based upon an evaluation of currently
available facts with respect to each individual site and also recorded related
insurance receivables of $15 million. the company records liabilities for
remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and
reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility
studies or the companys commitment to a plan of action. liabilities for
estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based
primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as
to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other
potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature
of required remedial actions. the company adjusts recorded liabilities as
further information develops or circumstances change. the company expects that
it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the
applicable sites, currently ranging up to 30 years.
it is difficult to estimate the
cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding
the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations,
the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternate
cleanup methods. developments may occur that could affect the companys current
assessment, including, but not limited to: (i) changes in the information
available regarding the environmental impact of the companys operations and
products; (ii) changes in environmental regulations or enforcement policies,
including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii) new and evolving
analytical and remediation techniques; (iv) success in allocating liability to
other potentially responsible parties; and (v) the financial viability of other
potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors.
note 12. employee savings and stock ownership plans
the company sponsors employee
savings plans under section 401(k) of the internal revenue code. these plans
are offered to substantially all regular u.s. employees. employee contributions
of up to 6% of compensation are matched at rates ranging from 35% to 50%, with
additional company contributions depending upon company performance. all
company contributions initially are invested in 3m common stock, with employee
contributions invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to their
elections. vested employees may diversify their 3m shares into other investment
options.
the company maintains an
employee stock ownership plan (esop). this plan was established in 1989 as a
cost-effective way of funding the majority of the companys contributions under
401(k) employee savings plans. total esop shares are considered to be shares
outstanding for earnings per share calculations.
dividends on shares held by the esop are paid
to the esop trust and, together with company contributions, are used by the
esop to repay principal and interest on the outstanding notes. the tax benefit
related to dividends paid on unallocated shares was charged directly to equity
and totaled approximately $4 million in both 2005 and 2004, and $5 million in 2003. over the life of the
notes, shares are released for allocation to participants based on the ratio of
the current years debt service to the remaining debt service prior to the
current payment.
the esop has been the primary funding source for the companys employee
savings plans. as permitted by aicpa statement of position 93-6, employers
accounting for employee stock ownership plans, the company has elected to
continue its practices, which are based on statement of position 76-3, accounting
practices for certain employee stock ownership plans and subsequent consensus
of the eitf of the fasb. accordingly, the debt of the esop is recorded as debt,
and shares pledged as collateral are reported as unearned compensation in the
consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of changes in
stockholders equity and comprehensive income. unearned compensation is reduced
symmetrically as the esop makes principal payments on the debt. expenses
related to the esop include total debt service on the notes, less dividends.
the company contributes treasury shares, accounted for at fair value, to
employee savings plans to cover obligations not funded by the esop (reported as
an employee benefit expense).

note 13. general employees stock purchase plan (gespp)
in may 1997,
shareholders approved 30 million shares for issuance under the companys gespp.
substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan.
participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant.
there are no gespp shares under option at the beginning or end of each year
because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last
business day of the same month.

grant, with expiration 10 years from the date of grant. effective with the may
2005 grant, the company changed its vesting period from one to three years with
the expiration date remaining at 10 years from date of grant. outstanding

note 15. business segments
3ms businesses are organized, managed and
internally grouped into segments based on differences in products, technologies
and services. these segments have worldwide responsibility for virtually all of
the companys product lines. 3m is not dependent on any single product or
market. transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3m is an
integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation,
cost allocations and inventory transfers. therefore, management does not
represent that these segments, if operated independently, would report the
operating income and other financial information shown. the allocations
resulting from the shared utilization of assets are not necessarily indicative
of the underlying activity for segment assets, depreciation and amortization,
and capital expenditures.

segment assets for the operating
business segments (excluding corporate and unallocated) primarily include
accounts receivable; inventory; property, plant and equipment  net; goodwill and intangible assets;
and other miscellaneous assets. assets included in corporate and unallocated
principally are cash and cash equivalents; insurance receivables; deferred
income taxes; certain investments and other assets, including prepaid pension
assets; and certain unallocated property, plant and equipment. corporate and
unallocated assets decreased approximately $1.8 billion in 2005, primarily due
to decreases in cash and cash equivalents. corporate and unallocated assets
increased approximately $2.6 billion in 2004, primarily due to increases in
prepaid pension assets ($2.0 billion) and increases in cash and cash
equivalents ($0.9 billion), with partial offsets in other asset accounts. for
management reporting purposes, corporate goodwill (which at december 31, 2005,
totaled approximately $320 million), is not allocated to the seven operating
business segments. in note 3 to the consolidated financial statements,
corporate goodwill has been allocated to the respective market segments as
required by sfas no. 142 for impairment testing.
corporate and unallocated
operating income principally includes corporate investment gains and losses,
certain derivative gains and losses, insurance-related gains and losses,
certain litigation expenses, corporate restructuring program charges and other
miscellaneous items. because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous
items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. in
2005, corporate and unallocated was impacted by a pre-tax charge of approximately $30 million in connection with
settlement agreements of one pending lepages follow-on class actions and of
two individual follow-on actions, all involving direct purchasers of
transparent tape. in 2003, corporate and unallocated includes a pre-tax
charge of $93 million related to an adverse ruling associated with a lawsuit
filed against 3m in 1997 by lepages inc.
note 16. geographic areas
