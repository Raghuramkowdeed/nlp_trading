table of contents
research and patents
research and product development constitutes an important part of 3ms activities and has been a major driver of 3ms sales growth. research, development and related expenses totaled $1.570 billion in 2011, $1.434 billion in 2010 and $1.293 billion in 2009. research and development, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.036 billion in 2011, $919 million in 2010 and $838 million in 2009. related expenses primarily include technical support provided by 3m to customers who are using existing 3m products; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; and amortization of acquired patents.
the companys products are sold around the world under various trademarks. the company also owns, or holds licenses to use, numerous u.s. and foreign patents. the companys research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered by new patents. patents applicable to specific products extend for varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is obtained. the actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
the company believes that its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses. in general, no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential to the company as a whole or to any of the companys business segments. the importance of patents in the display and graphics segment is described in performance by business segment  display and graphics business in partii,item 7, of this form10-k.
raw materials
in 2011, the company experienced cost increases in most raw materials and transportation fuel costs. this was driven by higher basic feedstock costs, including petroleum based materials, metals, minerals and woodpulp-based products. to date, the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts.
environmental law compliance
3ms manufacturing operations are affected by national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3m has made, and plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable laws. 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental matters from past operations at certain sites. refer to the environmental matters and litigation section in note 14, commitments and contingencies, for more detail.
environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the companys commitment to a plan of action. environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
in 2011, 3m invested about $15 million in capital projects to protect the environment. this amount excludes expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are expensed. capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control devices  such as wastewater treatment plant improvements, scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers  at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of business. consistent with the companys policies stressing environmental responsibility, capital expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for known projects are presently expected to be about $31million over the next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.
while the company cannot predict with certainty the future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating costs for environmental compliance, the company does not believe they will have a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive position.

cautionary note concerning factors that mayaffect future results
this annual report on form10-k, including managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of 1995. the company may also make forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission, in materials delivered to shareholders and in press releases. in addition, the companys representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking statements.
forward-looking statements relate to future events and typically address the companys expected future business and financial performance. words such as plan, expect, aim, believe, project, target, anticipate, intend, estimate, will, should, could and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such forward-looking statements. in particular, these include, among others, statements relating to the companys
strategy for growth, future revenues, earnings, cash flow, uses of cash and other measures of financial performance, and market position,
worldwide economic and capital markets conditions, such as interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates, financial conditions of our suppliers and customers, and natural and other disasters affecting the operations of the company or our suppliers and customers,
new business opportunities, product development, and future performance or results of current or anticipated products,
the scope, nature or impact of acquisition, strategic alliance and divestiture activities,
the outcome of contingencies, such as legal and regulatory proceedings,
future levels of indebtedness, common stock repurchases and capital spending,
future availability of and access to credit markets,
pension and postretirement obligation assumptions and future contributions, asset impairments, tax liabilities, information technology security, and
the effects of changes in tax, environmental and other laws and regulations in the united states and other countries in which we operate.
the company assumes no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements.
forward-looking statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors. important information as to these factors can be found in this document, including, among others, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations under the headings of overview, critical accounting estimates and financial condition and liquidity. discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from parti,item 1a, risk factors, of this document, and should be considered an integral part of partii,item 7, managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations. for additional information concerning factors that may cause actual results to vary materially from those stated in the forward-looking statements, see our reports on form10-k, 10-q and 8-k filed with the sec from time to time.
item 1a. risk factors
provided below is a cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most important risk factors applicable to the company. discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference into and considered an integral part of partii,item 7, managements discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations.
*results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic and capital markets conditions. the company operates in more than 65 countries and derives approximately two-thirds of its revenues from outside the united states. the companys business is subject to global competition and may be adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are beyond its control, such as disruptions in financial markets, economic downturns in the form of either contained or widespread recessionary conditions, elevated unemployment levels, sluggish or uneven recovery, in specific countries or regions, or in the various industries in which the company operates; social, political or labor conditions in specific countries or regions; natural and other disasters affecting the operations of the company or its customers and suppliers; or adverse changes in the availability and cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, or regulations in the jurisdictions in which the company operates.
*the companys credit ratings are important to 3ms cost of capital. the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the companys credit profile and assign debt ratings to 3m. the company currently has an aa- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from standard& poors and an aa2 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from moodys investors service. this evaluation is based on a number of factors, which include financial strength, business and financial risk,
table of contents
as well as transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. the companys current ratings have served to lower 3ms borrowing costs and facilitate access to a variety of lenders. failure to maintain the current ratings level would adversely affect the companys cost of funds and could adversely affect liquidity and access to capital markets.
*the companys results are affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. demand for the companys products, which impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i)the development and timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii)the companys response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii)changes in customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price changes, changes in the companys incentive programs, or the customers ability to achieve incentive goals; and (iv)changes in customers preferences for our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for some of the companys products.
*foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the companys ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings. because the companys financial statements are denominated in u.s. dollars and approximately two-thirds of the companys revenues are derived from outside the united states, the companys results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the u.s. dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.
*the companys growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new products and to bring those products to market. this ability may be adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. there are no guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.
*the companys future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials and energy, including oil and natural gas and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency exchange risks, natural disasters and other factors. the company depends on various components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its products. it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be terminated in the future. any sustained interruption in the companys receipt of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company. in addition, while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the company will be able to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company.
*acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational restructuring could affect future results. the company monitors its business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its organizational structure. with respect to acquisitions, future results will be affected by the companys ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and obtain the anticipated synergies.

*the companys future results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings and legal compliance risks, including those involving product liability, antitrust, environmental, the u.s. foreign corrupt practices act and other anti-bribery, anti-corruption, or other matters. the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the companys expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. various factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or cash flows in any particular period. for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated accounting estimates, see the discussion in note 14 commitments and contingencies within the notes to consolidated financial statements.

item 7. managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations (md&a) is designed to provide a reader of 3ms financial statements with a narrative from the perspective of management. 3ms md&a is presented in eight sections:
overview
results of operations
performance by business segment
performance by geographic area
critical accounting estimates
new accounting pronouncements
financial condition and liquidity
financial instruments
overview
3m is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, effective in the first quarter of 2011, 3m made certain product moves between its business segments in its continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets and customers. the financial information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. 3m manages its operations in six operating business segments: industrial and transportation; health care; consumer and office; safety, security and protection services; display and graphics; and electro and communications.
fourth-quarter 2011 sales totaled $7.1 billion, an increase of 5.7 percent from the fourth quarter of 2010. net income attributable to 3m was $954 million, or $1.35 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of 2011, compared to $928 million, or $1.28 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2010. 3ms sales growth was led by its industrial-oriented businesses, along with steady growth in consumer and health care. the business environment remained challenging, impacted by deteriorating demand in western europe and slower consumer electronics activity. while sales grew across much of the portfolio, sales of optical films for lcd tvs remained weak and momentum also slowed in other parts of electronics. four of the companys six business segments showed growth in sales, led by industrial and transportation at 14.3 percent, safety, security and protection services at 9.4 percent, consumer and office at 6.1 percent, and health care at 5.4 percent. a slowdown in electronics-related businesses negatively impacted both the electro and communications and display and graphics business segments. electro and communications sales decreased 2.7 percent and display and graphics sales declined 8.8 percent. sales declined 17 percent in optical systems, which is part of display and graphics, impacted by end-market weakness and lower attachment rates in lcd tvs.
fourth-quarter 2011 sales increased in every major geographic region, with latin america/canada up 9.7 percent, the u.s. up 7.4 percent, europe/middle east/africa up 4.4 percent, and asia pacific up 2.8 percent. excluding optical systems, asia pacific sales increased 7.6 percent. of the 5.7 percent worldwide sales growth, 3.3 points was from the combined impact of higher organic volume of 1.3 points and selling price growth of 2.0 points, 2.3 points was from acquisitions, and 0.1 points was from favorable currency effects. organic volume growth of 1.3 percent reflected slower growth in asia pacific, partially due to weakness across the electronics market and slower growth in china, in addition to weakness in western europe.
during 2011, 3m was impacted by the first-quarter earthquake and tsunami in japan and by the fourth-quarter flooding in thailand. automobile and electronic manufacturers were most impacted; thus, 3ms automotive oem and electronics-related businesses were most affected. 3m estimates that combined direct and indirect business disruption resulting from the 2011 japan natural disaster, net of the benefit from sales of 3m products used in the reconstruction efforts and initial insurance recoveries, plus the impact of thailand flooding, reduced 2011 sales growth by an estimated 0.8 percentage points and earnings by approximately 6 cents per diluted share, with most of this impact in the first half of 2011. in the fourth quarter of 2011, the flooding in thailand reduced sales growth by an estimated $35 million and operating income by $20 million, with this operating income effect offset by $23 million in insurance recoveries related to the earthquake and tsunami in japan. japan represented approximately 9 percent of total 3m sales for total year 2011. as conditions improve, 3m has been working to capture additional sales for its businesses, such as products used in clean-up (construction and home improvement products), safety-related products (respirator masks and personal protective equipment), energy savings/refurbishment products (window films) and products that help in the rebuilding effort (traffic safety, telecommunication/utility and commercial construction). related to these natural disasters, based on 3ms current assessment, no material asset or investment impairments have been recorded. in addition, 3m is not aware of any significant issues related to these natural
table of contents
disasters concerning inventory, customer receivables, lease terminations, environmental exposures, guarantees, indemnifications, debt covenant compliance, or significant tax issues. 3m does have certain insurance coverage which limits its exposure and resulted in some initial recovery in the fourth quarter of 2011 (as discussed above).
sales in 2011 increased 11.1 percent to $29.6 billion, led by industrial and transportation, safety, security and protection services, and health care. all major geographic regions showed improvement, led by latin america/canada. the increase in global sales reflected improved market penetration and new product flow along with significant growth in important end-markets such as general industrial and personal safety. net income attributable to 3m was $4.283 billion, or $5.96 per diluted share in 2011, compared to $4.085 billion, or $5.63 per diluted share, in 2010 (including the first-quarter 2010 special item discussed below).
fourth-quarter 2010 sales grew nearly 10 percent to $6.7 billion, despite negative comparisons from h1n1 and moderating sales growth in optical films for lcd tvs. sales growth was broad-based, with organic sales volumes expanding in all businesses, led by an 18.7 percent increase in electro and communications and a 14.7 percent increase in display and graphics. geographically, organic sales volume was strongest in asia pacific at 18.1 percent and latin america at 12.2 percent. net income attributable to 3m in the fourth quarter of 2010 was $928 million, or $1.28 per diluted shares, compared to $935 million, or $1.30 per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of 2009. fourth-quarter income was penalized by year-on-year h1n1-related comparisons, increases in raw material costs, and investments to accelerate future growth. 3m invested in research and development, sales and marketing (including advertising and merchandising investments), and also incurred acquisition-related costs in the fourth quarter. 3m made several large fourth-quarter 2010 acquisitions, including arizant inc., attenti holdings s.a. and cogent inc.
for total year 2010, the company posted 2010 sales of $26.7 billion, up 15.3 percent. during the year, 3m invested significantly to improve long-term growth. for example, research, development and related expenses of $1.4 billion helped to drive innovation and new product sales. 3m also accelerated sales and marketing investments in high-growth markets to help secure future growth. all businesses posted positive organic volume growth, led by display and graphics at 26.5 percent, electro and communications at 26.0 percent, and industrial and transportation at 16.6 percent. including special items (discussed below), net income attributable to 3m in 2010 was $4.085 billion, or $5.63 per diluted share, compared to $3.193 billion or $4.52 per diluted share, in 2009.
in 2010, 3m recorded a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $84 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, resulting from the march2010 enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act, including modifications made in the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010. refer to the special items discussion at the end of this overview section for more detail.
3m has been aggressively restructuring the company since early 2008 and continued this effort through the third quarter of 2009, with these restructuring actions and exit activities resulting in an aggregate reduction of approximately 6,400 positions. the related net restructuring charges and other special items reduced net income attributable to 3m for year 2009 by $119 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. refer to the special items discussion at the end of this overview section for more detail. these restructuring actions and exit activities resulted in savings of almost $400 million in 2009 and additional incremental savings of more than $150 million in 2010, with the majority of 2010s benefit in the first half of the year. in addition, 3m amended its policy regarding banked vacation in 2009, which added more than $100 million to operating income in 2009, with a benefit of approximately $80 million in 2010.
the following table contains sales and operating income results by business segment for the years ended december31, 2011 and 2010. in addition to the discussion below, refer to the section entitled performance by business segment and performance by geographic area later in md&a for a more detailed discussion of the sales and income results of the company and its respective business segments (including corporate and unallocated). refer to note 17 for additional information on business segments, including elimination of dual credit.

sales in 2011 increased 11.1 percent, led by industrial and transportation at 19.5 percent, safety, security and protection services at 15.2 percent, and health care at 11.5 percent. electro and communications sales increased 8.6 percent and consumer and office sales increased 7.8 percent. sales declined 5.4 percent in display and graphics, due to fewer orders for optical films. total company local-currency sales growth (which includes volume, selling price and acquisition impacts, but excludes divestiture and translation impacts) was 8.0 percent and foreign currency impacts added 3.1 percent. 3ms business segments all posted operating income margins in excess of 20 percent in 2011 and 2010. worldwide operating income margins for 2011 were 20.9 percent, compared to 22.2 percent for 2010.
in 2010, sales increased 15.3 percent, led by electro and communications at 27.5 percent, display and graphics at 24.0 percent,industrial and transportation at 18.4 percent, and consumer and office at 11.0 percent. sales growth in these business segments was led by consumer electronics, automotive oem, renewable energy, and broad-based consumer and office growth, as well as sales growth in those businesses that serve the broad industrial manufacturing sector. local-currency sales (which includes volume, selling price and acquisition impacts, but excludes divestiture and translation impacts) increased 14.4 percent. foreign currency effects added 1.0 percent to sales, while divestiture impacts reduced sales by 0.1 percent. operating income margins for 2010 were 22.2 percent, compared to 20.8 percent in 2009.
3m generated approximately $5.3 billion of operating cash flows in 2011, an increase of $110 million when compared to 2010. this followed an increase of $233 million when comparing 2010 to 2009. refer to the section entitled financial condition and liquidity later in md&a for a discussion of items impacting cash flows. in february2011, 3ms board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion of 3ms outstanding common stock, which replaced the companys previous repurchase program. the current authorization has no pre-established end date. in 2011, the company purchased $2.701 billion of treasury stock, of which a portion was under the previous authorization, compared to $854 million of treasury stock repurchases in 2010. in 2009, the company placed added emphasis on maintaining ample liquidity and enhancing balance sheet strength. as a result, share repurchase activity was minimal and no broker repurchases of stock were made. as of december31, 2011, approximately $4.6 billion of 3m common stock remained available for repurchase under the current authorization. in february2012, 3ms board of directors authorized a dividend increase of 7.3 percent for 2012, marking the 54th consecutive year of dividend increases for 3m. 3ms debt to total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) was 25 percent at both december31, 2011 and december31, 2010, compared to 30 percent at december31, 2009. 3m has an aa- credit rating with a stable outlook from standard& poors and an aa2 credit rating with a stable outlook from moodys investors service. the company has significant cash on hand and sufficient additional access to capital markets to meet its funding needs.
in 2011, the company experienced cost increases in most raw materials and transportation fuel costs. this was driven by higher basic feedstock costs, including petroleum based materials, metals, minerals and woodpulp-based products. to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. it is impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have. 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development and qualification of additional supply sources. 3m manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts.

on a worldwide basis, 3ms pension and postretirement plans were 82 percent funded at year-end 2011. the u.s. qualified plans, which are approximately 71 percent of the worldwide pension obligation, were 86 percent funded, the international pension plans were 87 percent funded, and the u.s. non-qualified pension plan is not funded. asset returns in 2011 for the u.s. qualified plan were 8.7%. the year-end 2011 discount rate was 4.15%, down 1.08 percentage points from the 2010 discount rate of 5.23%. the decrease in discount rates, both u.s. and internationally, resulted in a significantly higher valuation of the projected benefit obligation, which reduced the plans funded status. the changes in 3ms defined-benefit pension and postretirement plans funded status significantly impacted several balance sheet lines. these changes increased long-term liabilities by approximately $2.4 billion and decreased stockholders equity by approximately $1.6 billion, with the other major impact primarily related to increased deferred taxes within other assets. other pension and postretirement changes during the year, such as contributions and amortization, also impacted these balance sheet captions.
3m expects to contribute approximately $800 million to $1 billion of cash to its global pension and postretirement plans in 2012, with approximately $300 million in each of the first and second quarters. the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2012. 3m expects pension and postretirement benefit expense in 2012 to increase by approximately $89 million pre-tax, or approximately 9 cents per diluted share, when compared to 2011. this 9 cents per diluted share increase includes the costs associated with a voluntary incentive program (discussed in next paragraph). refer to critical accounting estimates within md&a and note 11 (pension and postretirement benefit plans) for additional information concerning 3ms pension and post-retirement plans.
3m expects to incur early retirement/restructuring costs of approximately 4 cents per diluted share in the first quarter of 2012. of this amount, approximately 3 cents per diluted share relates to special termination benefits for the voluntary retirement incentive program in the united states (discussed in note 11). the remainder relates to selective restructuring in a few developed countries. these actions, in aggregate, are expected to be neutral to full-year 2012 earnings, with the costs incurred in the first quarter of 2012, and the associated benefits realized over the remainder of 2012.
there are a few major items that will negatively impact earnings in 2012. as discussed further above, 3m expects that pension and postretirement expense will decrease 2012 earnings, when compared to 2011, by approximately 9 cents per diluted share. 3ms early assessment of the income tax rate indicates an expected 2012 effective tax rate of approximately 29.5 percent compared to 27.8 percent for 2011. in addition, currency effects are expected to have a negative impact on earnings. 3m currently expects that sales growth and related incremental income, in addition to expected productivity improvements, selling price increases in excess of raw material inflation, and other benefits, should more than offset the items that will negatively impact earnings.
forward-looking statements in item7 may involve risks and uncertainties that could cause results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the section entitled cautionary note concerning factors that mayaffect future results in item1 and the risk factors provided in item 1a for discussion of these risks and uncertainties).
special items:
special items represent significant charges or credits that are important to understanding changes in the companys underlying operations.
in 2010, 3m recorded a one-time, non-cash income tax charge of $84 million, or 12 cents per diluted share, resulting from the march2010 enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act, including modifications made in the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 (collectively, the act).the charge is due to a reduction in the value of the companys deferred tax asset as a result of the acts change to the tax treatment of medicare partd reimbursements. this item is discussed in more detail in note 8 (income taxes).
in 2009, net losses for restructuring and other actions decreased operating income by $194 million and net income attributable to 3m by $119 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. 2009 included restructuring actions ($209 million pre-tax, $128 million after tax and noncontrolling interest), which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate ($15 million pre-tax, $9 million after tax). the gain on sale of real estate relates to the june2009 sale of a new jersey roofing granule facility, which is recorded in cost of sales within the safety, security and protection services business segment. restructuring is discussed in more detail in note 4 (restructuring actions).

pension and postretirement expense increased in both 2011 and 2010. the year-on-year increase for 2011 compared to 2010, and 2010 compared to 2009, was $233 million and $99 million, respectively. these increases negatively impacted cost of sales; selling, general and administrative expenses (sg&a); and research, development and related expenses (r&d).
cost of sales:
cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. cost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 53.0 percent in 2011, an increase of 1.1 percentage points from 2010 levels. on a dollar basis, selling price increases largely offset raw material inflation for total year 2011, as selling prices increased 1 percent year-on-year and gross raw material prices increased approximately 4 percent year-on-year. however, measured as a percent of sales, selling price/gross raw material impacts accounted for approximately 0.5 percentage points of the cost of sales increase. as discussed in the preceding paragraph, cost of sales as a percent of net sales was also negatively impacted by higher pension and postretirement costs. these impacts were partially offset by organic sales volume growth of 3.7 percent.
cost of sales, measured as a percent of net sales, was 51.9 percent in 2010, a decrease of 0.5 percentage points from 2009. a number of positive factors impacted year-on-year results. these factors included 13.7 percent growth in organic sales volume, improved factory utilization levels, along with cost savings related to prior years restructuring actions. in addition, 2009 included a penalty of 0.5 percentage points (as a percent of net sales) related to special items. as discussed in note 4 (restructuring actions), in 2009, 3m recorded $209 million in restructuring charges, of which $110 million was recorded in cost of sales. this was partially offset by a $15 million gain on sale of a new jersey roofing granule facility, which was also recorded in cost of sales. in addition, 3m decided to swap venezuelan bolivars into u.s. dollars in 2009, given the economic conditions in venezuela at that time, which also negatively impacted cost of sales in 2009. these year-on-year net benefits were partially offset by pricing impacts, as selling prices declined 0.2 percent year-on-year, and gross raw material prices increased approximately 2 percent year-on-year.
selling, general and administrative expenses:
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased 13 percent in 2011 when compared to 2010, due to several factors. approximately 5 percentage points of this growth in sg&a was due to increases from businesses acquired in the last twelve months, primarily related to sg&a spending for the winterthur technologie ag, arizant inc., cogent inc. and attenti holdings s.a. acquisitions. another 3 percentage points of growth in 2011 sg&a was due to foreign exchange effects, which resulted in higher translated costs from 3ms non-u.s. subsidiaries. finally, 2011 sg&a increased in part due to higher year-on-year pension and postretirement expense and continued investments to support future growth, such as sales representatives, advertising and promotional investments. sg&a expenses, measured as a percent of net sales, increased 0.3 percentage points in 2011 compared to 2010.
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses increased 12 percent in 2010 when compared to 2009. in 2010, sales and marketing expenses increased 14 percent, which included advertising and promotion investment increases of over 20 percent in 2010, which helped drive sales volumes. in addition, 3m increased both sales coverage and its marketing strength, particularly in faster-growing emerging economies. in 2010, general and administrative costs remained under control, as these costs increased at approximately half the rate of 2010 sales growth. sg&a expenses, measured as a percent of net sales, decreased 0.7 percentage points in 2010 compared to 2009. as indicated in note 4, restructuring expenses of $91 million were recorded in sg&a expenses in 2009. measured as a percent of sales, these restructuring expenses increased 2009 sg&a expenses by 0.4 percentage points.
research, development and related expenses:
research, development and related expenses (r&d) expense increased 9.5 percent in 2011 compared to 2010, and increased 11 percent in 2010 compared to 2009, as 3m continued to support its key growth initiatives. in 2011, r&d expense increased versus 2010 due to r&d related to businesses acquired in the last 12 months, foreign exchange effects, and higher pension and postretirement expense, in addition to 3ms continued investment in new products. r&d, measured as a percent of sales, was 5.3 percent in 2011, compared to 5.4 percent in 2010 and 5.6 percent in 2009.
operating income:
3m uses operating income as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. operating income was 20.9 percent of sales in 2011, compared to 22.2 percent of sales in 2010, primarily due to higher cost of

sales (as a percent of sales) in 2011 when compared to 2010. operating income was 20.8 percent of sales in 2009. 2009 was negatively impacted by restructuring expenses, net of a gain on sale of real estate, which on a combined basis decreased operating income by 0.9 percentage points ($194 million).

interest expense: interest expense decreased in both 2011 and 2010, driven by lower average u.s. debt balances and lower interest rates.
interest income: in 2011, interest income increased slightly, as higher international cash balances and better investment yields were largely offset by a lower u.s. cash balance. in 2010, interest income also increased slightly, with higher average cash and cash equivalent balances largely offset by lower interest rates.

the effective tax rate for 2011 was 27.8 percent, compared to 27.7 percent in 2010, an increase of 0.1 percent. the year-on-year change in international income taxes increased the effective tax rate for 2011 when compared to 2010 by approximately 2.5 percent, which includes a partial offsetting benefit from the corporate reorganization of a wholly owned international subsidiary in 2011. this 2.5 percent net increase was due primarily to certain 2010 tax benefits, which did not repeat in 2011, related to net operating losses partially offset by a valuation allowance resulting from the 2010 corporate alignment transactions that allowed the company to increase its ownership of a foreign subsidiary. these transactions are described in the section of note 6 entitled purchase and sale of subsidiary shares and transfers of ownership interests involving non-wholly owned subsidiaries. other significant items impacting the year-on-year comparison include a one-time 2010 income tax charge of $84 million, which benefited the 2011 tax rate when compared to 2010 by 1.5 percent, as this charge did not repeat in 2011. this 2010 charge was a result of the march2010 enactment of the patient protection and affordable care act, including modifications made in the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010. the companys effective tax rate also benefited during 2011 when compared to 2010 by approximately 0.7 percent from adjustments to its income tax reserves.
the effective tax rate for 2010 was 27.7 percent, compared to 30.0 percent in 2009, a decrease of 2.3 percent. this included an approximately 1.8 percent decrease related to the year-on-year change in international income taxes, due primarily to the corporate alignment transactions discussed above. additionally, the companys effective tax rate benefited in 2010 compared to 2009 by approximately 1.3 percent from adjustments to its income tax reserves, and by approximately 0.9 percent from additional domestic manufacturers deductions. these benefits were partially offset by a 1.5 percent increase related to the one-time 2010 income tax charge of $84 million.
on december17, 2010, the provision for the research and development credit was extended by the 2010 tax relief act for expenditures incurred up to december31, 2011. the expiration of this research and development credit will have a negative impact on the effective tax rate in 2012 and forward if this credit is not extended in future years.
the company currently expects that its effective tax rate for total year 2012 will be approximately 29.5 percent. the rate can vary from quarter to quarter due to discrete items, such as the settlement of income tax audits and changes in tax laws, as well as recurring factors, such as the geographic mix of income before taxes.

related to sumitomo 3m limited (japan), which is 3ms most significant consolidated entity with non-3m ownership interests. as of december31, 2011, 3ms effective ownership in sumitomo 3m limited is 75 percent.
currency effects:
3m estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, increased net income attributable to 3m by approximately $154 million in 2011 and increased net income attributable to 3m by approximately $15 million in 2010. this estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into u.s. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping venezuelan bolivars into u.s. dollars. 3m estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses had an immaterial impact on net income attributable to 3m in 2011 and decreased net income attributable to 3m by approximately $115 million in 2010.
performance by business segment
disclosures relating to 3ms business segments are provided in item 1, business segments. financial information and other disclosures are provided in the notes to the consolidated financial statements. as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, effective in the first quarter of 2011, 3m made certain product moves between its business segments in its continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets and customers. segment information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all periods presented. the reportable segments are industrial and transportation; health care; consumer and office; safety, security and protection services; display and graphics; and electro and communications. information related to 3ms business segments is presented in the tables that follow. local-currency sales change amounts are separated into organic local-currency sales (which include both organic volume impacts plus selling price impacts) and acquisition impacts. the divestiture impact, translation impact and total sales change are also provided for each segment.
in addition to these six operating business segments, 3m assigns certain costs to corporate and unallocated, which is presented separately in the preceding business segments table and in note 17. corporate and unallocated includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the company may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis. the primary item driving higher 2011 expenses when compared to 2010 relates to pension and postretirement expense, as a portion of the 2011 increase in these expenses was not allocated directly to the six operating business segments. the primary items driving higher 2010 expenses when compared to 2009 relates to increased pension and postretirement expense, in addition to increased stock-based compensation expense.
as discussed in the preceding overview and results of operations section, the combination of restructuring actions and other special items significantly impacted 2009 results. there were no special items that impacted operating income in 2011 or 2010. the following table summarizes special items by business segment.

the industrial and transportation segment serves a broad range of markets, such as automotive original equipment manufacturer (oem) and automotive aftermarket (auto body shops and retail), renewable energy, electronics, paper and packaging, food and beverage, and appliance. industrial and transportation products include tapes, a wide variety of coated and non-woven abrasives, adhesives, specialty materials, filtration products, energy control products, closure systems for personal hygiene products, acoustic systems products, and components and products that are used in the manufacture, repair and maintenance of automotive, marine, aircraft and specialty vehicles.
year 2011 results:
sales in industrial and transportation increased 19.5 percent to $10.1 billion. in local-currency terms, sales increased 15.9 percent, with 10.0 percent of this increase attributable to organic local-currency growth. acquisitions increased sales by 5.9 percent, primarily driven by winterthur and alpha beta (discussed below). foreign currency impacts added 3.6 percent to 2011 sales growth. geographically, local-currency sales increased in all major regions, led by asia pacific and europe. local-currency sales growth was broad-based across the portfolio, led by abrasives systems, renewable energy, aerospace and aircraft maintenance, industrial adhesives and tapes, and energy and advanced materials. in addition, despite the japan and thailand natural disasters, 3m also achieved growth in its automotive aftermarket and automotive oem businesses.
3m continues to invest in its industrial and transportation business. in march2011, 3m acquired a controlling interest in winterthur via completion of a public tender offer. winterthur, based in zug, switzerland, is a leading global supplier of precision grinding technology serving customers in the area of hard-to-grind precision applications in industrial, automotive, aircraft, and cutting tools. in addition, in february2011, 3m completed its acquisition of the tape-related assets of alpha beta, a leading manufacturer of box sealing tape and masking tape headquartered in taipei, taiwan.
operating income was $2.1 billion in 2011, 17.3 percent higher than 2010. 3m achieved operating income margins of 20.4 percent, even with continued investments to support growth.
year 2010 results:
sales in industrial and transportation increased 18.4 percent to $8.4 billion. in local-currency terms, sales increased 17.2 percent, driven almost entirely by organic volume. foreign currency impacts added 1.2 percent to 2010 sales growth. geographically, local-currency sales growth increased in all major geographic regions, led by asia pacific. local-currency sales growth was broad-based across the portfolio, led by renewable energy, automotive oem, energy and advanced materials, aerospace, abrasives systems, and industrial adhesives and tapes.
operating income increased 43 percent to $1.8 billion in 2010, with operating income margins of 20.8 percent. in 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $89 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits of $84 million and fixed asset impairments of $5 million.
investment:
in march2005, 3ms automotive business completed the purchase of 19 percent of ti&m beteiligungsgesellschaft mbh (ti&m) for approximately $55 million. ti&m is the parent company of i&t innovation technology entwicklungsund holding aktiengesellschaft (i&t), an austrian maker of flat flexible cable and circuitry. pursuant to a
table of contents
shareholders agreement, 3m marketed the firms flat flexible wiring systems for automotive interior applications to the global automotive market. i&t filed a petition for bankruptcy protection in august2006. as part of its agreement to purchase the shares of ti&m, the company was granted a put option, which gave the company the right to sell back its entire ownership interest in ti&m to the other investors from whom 3m acquired its 19 percent interest. the put option became exercisable january1, 2007. the company exercised the put option and recovered approximately $25 million of its investment from one of the investors based in belgium in february2007. the other two ti&m investors from whom 3m purchased its shares have filed a bankruptcy petition in austria. the company has recovered approximately 6.7 million euros through this bankruptcy process, which in addition to prior recoveries, results in a remaining investment balance of approximately 12 million euros (approximately $15 million) as of december31, 2011. the company is pursuing recovery of the balance of its investment, first, from the bank that held the 3m purchase price paid to the two bankrupt investors and, to the extent not made whole, pursuant to the terms of the share purchase agreement. the company believes collection of its remaining investment is probable and, as a result, no impairment reserve has been recorded.

the health care segment serves markets that include medical clinics and hospitals, pharmaceuticals, dental and orthodontic practitioners, and health information systems. products and services provided to these and other markets include medical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products, inhalation and transdermal drug delivery systems, dental and orthodontic products (oral care), health information systems, and food safety products.
year 2011 results:
health care sales increased 11.5 percent to $5.0 billion. local-currency sales increased 8.4 percent, including 3.8 percent from acquisitions. acquisition growth primarily related to arizant inc., a leading manufacturer of patient warming solutions designed to prevent hypothermia in surgical settings. currency impacts increased sales by 3.1 percent in health care. on a geographic basis, all regions posted positive sales growth. asia pacific, latin america/canada, and europe all reported sales growth of 10 percent or more, while the u.s. grew at 9 percent. local currency sales growth was led by the infection prevention, health information systems, food safety, skin and wound care, and oral care businesses. sales in the drug-delivery systems business increased in the fourth quarter of 2011 compared to the same period in 2010, but were down slightly for total-year 2011 when compared to 2010.
operating income in health care increased 9.3 percent in 2011 to $1.5 billion. operating income margins were 29.6 percent, compared to 30.2 percent in 2010, with this decrease due in part to growth investments in the health information systems and infection prevention businesses. 3m has also been investing in emerging markets over the past couple of years to improve market penetration levels. the year-on-year decline in operating income margins was also due in part to sales declines in drug delivery systems. 3ms long-term expectation is that health care operating income margins will be in the high 20s, as 3m continues to invest to grow this business.
year 2010 results:
health care local-currency sales increased 5.3 percent, including a benefit of 1.2 percent from acquisitions, primarily related to the arizant inc. acquisition in the fourth quarter (discussed above). currency impacts increased sales by 0.3 percent. on a geographic basis, all regions posted positive local-currency sales growth, led by asia pacific and latin america/canada. local currency sales growth was broad-based, led by skin and wound care, drug delivery systems, health information systems, infection prevention and oral care.

businesses, which each had local-currency sales growth of greater than 25 percent. 3m also saw strong growth in the electrical markets business. 3ms telecom infrastructure-related business increased slightly year-on-year.
operating income was $670 million in 2010, or 22.0 percent of sales, which was significantly improved versus 2009 as the consumer electronic-related businesses showed significant year-on-year improvements. in 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $11 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits.
performance by geographic area
while 3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results are the most relevant measure of performance, the company also utilizes geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. export sales are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made. a portion of the products or components sold by 3ms operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. as customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3ms results will follow. thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area.
financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in note 18. operating income results by geographic area were significantly impacted by restructuring and other items. in 2009, restructuring actions, partially offset by a gain on sales of real estate, decreased worldwide operating income by $194 million, with the largest impact in europe, asia pacific and the united states.

employment:
at december31, 2011, employment increased by 4,141 positions since year-end 2010, largely driven by acquisitions (estimated 2,250 full-time equivalents) and additions in developing economies. at december31, 2010, employment increased by 5,222 positions since year-end 2009, largely driven by acquisitions (estimated 1,850 full-time equivalents) and additions in developing economies.
capital spending/net property, plant and equipment:
capital expenditures were $1.379 billion in 2011, compared to $1.091 billion in 2010 and $903 million in 2009. the company expects 2012 capital spending to be approximately $1.3 to $1.5 billion as 3m continues to invest in capacity for future growth. in 2011, a large portion of the investment is addressing supply constraints in a number of businesses with significant growth potential, such as renewable energy, traffic signage in developing economies, and optically clear adhesives and glass bubbles. in addition, spending on some of the following 2010 capital projects carried forward into 2011. in 2010, in the u.s., 3m invested in film manufacturing assets for optical systems and other non-optical businesses which use similar technology. in 2010, 3m also increased capacity at its multi-purpose manufacturing facility in singapore and invested in optical film capacity in korea. lastly, in 2010, investments in the industrial and transportation business included solar energy in the u.s. and industrial adhesives and tapes in china.
table of contents
in 2009, in response to then-difficult global economic conditions, the company reduced its capital spending significantly.
3m is striving to increase its manufacturing and sourcing capacity outside the united states in order to more closely align its production capability with its sales in major geographic regions. the initiative is expected to help improve customer service, lower transportation costs, and reduce working capital requirements.
critical accounting estimates
information regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1. as stated in note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal proceedings, the companys pension and postretirement obligations, asset impairments and income taxes. senior management has discussed the development, selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of 3ms board of directors.
legal proceedings:
the categories of claims for which the company has a probable and estimable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to legal proceedings. please refer to the section entitled process for disclosure and recording of liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings (contained in legal proceedings in note 14) for additional information about such estimates.
pension and postretirement obligations:
3m has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all u.s. employees and many employees outside the united states. the u.s. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective january1, 2009. the company accounts for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification (asc) 715, compensation  retirement benefits, in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic benefit cost. asc 715 requires employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders equity. while the company believes the valuation methods used to determine the fair value of plan assets are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.
pension benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participants years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and liability measurement. see note11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december31 measurement date for its pension and postretirement benefit plans. the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. using this methodology, the company determined a discount rate of 4.15% for u.s. pension and 4.04% for u.s. postretirement benefits to be appropriate as of december31, 2011, which represents a decrease from the 5.23% and 5.09% rates, respectively, used as of december31, 2010. the weighted average discount rate for international pension plans as of december31, 2011 was 4.58%, a decrease from the 5.04% rate used as of december31, 2010.
table of contents
a significant element in determining the companys pension expense in accordance with asc 715 is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. for the u.s. pension plan, the 2012 expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for 2012 is 8.25%, a 0.25% decrease from 2011. refer to note 11 for information on how the 2012 rate was determined. return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions. the weighted average expected return for the international pension plan is 6.38% for 2012, compared to 6.58% for 2011.
for the year ended december31, 2011, the company recognized total consolidated pre-tax pension and postretirement expense (after settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) of $555 million, up from $322million in 2010. pension and postretirement expense (before settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) is anticipated to increase to approximately $644million in 2012, an increase of $89 million compared to 2011. for the pension plans, holding all other factors constant, a 0.25 percentage point increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of return on plan assets would decrease/increase 2012 pension expense by approximately $30million for u.s. pension plans and approximately $12 million for international pension plans. also, holding all other factors constant, a 0.25 percentage point increase in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would decrease 2012 pension expense by approximately $37 million for u.s. pension plans and approximately $16 million for international pension plans. in addition, a 0.25 percentage point decrease in the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities would increase 2012 pension expense by approximately $39 million for u.s. pension plans and approximately $19 million for international pension plans.
asset impairments:
as of december31, 2011, net property, plant and equipment totaled $7.7 billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $1.9 billion. management makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. this includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business, including assets of acquired businesses. these estimates and assumptions are closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. for instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset group. impairments recorded in 2009 related to restructuring actions are discussed in note4.
in june2009, 3ms security systems division (within the safety, security and protection services business segment) was notified that the uk government decided to award the production of its passports to a competitor upon the expiration of 3ms existing uk passport contracts in october2010. as a result of this event, in june2009, 3m tested the long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity for recoverability and also reassessed their remaining useful lives. in addition, 3m tested goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit (security systems division) level. the result of the june2009 test of recoverability of long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity indicated that the asset groupings carrying amount of approximately $54 million (before impairment) exceeded the remaining expected cash flows. accordingly, 3m recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $13 million in the second quarter of 2009 to write these assets down to their fair value. in addition, accelerated depreciation/amortization was taken over the period june2009 through the date of expiration of the contract based on a reassessment of the remaining expected useful life of these assets.
3m goodwill totaled approximately $7.0 billion as of december31, 2011. 3ms annual goodwill impairment testing is performed in the fourth quarter of each year. impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. reporting units are one level below the business segment level (3m has six business segments at december31, 2011), but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. at 3m, reporting units generally correspond to a division. 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing.
an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3m typically uses the price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash flows. 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position and declining businesses, but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to economic or other conditions.

as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, effective in the first quarter of 2011, 3m made certain product moves between its business segments. for those changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact to reporting units. during the first quarter of 2011, the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. the discussion that follows relates to the separate fourth quarter 2011 annual impairment test and is in the context of the segment structure that existed at that time.
as of september30, 2011, 3m had 38 primary reporting units, with ten reporting units accounting for approximately 76 percent of the goodwill. these ten reporting units were comprised of the following divisions: 3m purification inc., occupational health and environmental safety, optical systems,infection prevention, security systems, 3m espe,industrial adhesives and tapes, communication markets, abrasive systems and health information systems.
the fair values for 3m purification inc. and optical systems, based on fourth quarter 2011 testing, were both in excess of carrying value by approximately 35 percent, while security systems was in excess of carrying value by 38 percent, all with no impairment indicated. as part of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter, 3m used a weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for these divisions, using projected cash flows that were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions, among other factors. the weighting was based on managements estimates of the likelihood of each scenario occurring. the fair values for all other significant reporting units were in excess of carrying value by more than 40 percent.
in 2011, 3m primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units, to determine fair values. goodwill is testing for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year. based on fourth-quarter 2011 testing, 3ms estimated fair value when valuing each reporting unit individually would aggregate to approximately $68 billion, implying a control premium of 35 percent when compared to 3ms market value of approximately $50 billion at september30, 2011. at december31, 2011, 3ms market value was approximately $57 billion, implying a control premium of 19 percent. the control premium is defined as the sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3ms total company estimated fair value, with the sum of the individual values typically being larger than the value for the total company. 3ms market value at both september30, 2011 and december31, 2011 was significantly in excess of its equity of approximately $17 billion and $16 billion, respectively. 3m is an integrated materials enterprise, thus; many of 3ms businesses could not easily be sold on a stand-alone basis. based on its annual test in the fourth quarter of 2011, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting units.
factors which could result in future impairment charges, among others, include changes in worldwide economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. these risk factors are discussed in item 1a, risk factors, of this document. as of december31, 2011, 3m had approximately $1 billion of goodwill related to 3m purification inc., $750 million related to optical systems and $500 million related to security systems. if future non-cash asset impairment charges are taken, 3m would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets or goodwill would be impaired. 3m will continue to monitor its reporting units in 2012 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.
income taxes:
the extent of 3ms operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. the final taxes paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from federal, state, and international tax audits. the company recognizes potential liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. the company follows guidance provided by asc 740,income taxes, regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to record these liabilities (refer to note 8 for additional information). the company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the companys current estimate of the tax liabilities. if the companys estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. if payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.

financial condition and liquidity
as indicated in the following table, at december31, 2011, 3m had $4.576 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities and $5.166 billion of debt. debt included $4.484 billion of long-term debt, $563 million related to the current portion of long-term debt and short-term borrowings of $119 million. the strength of 3ms capital structure and consistency of its cash flows provide 3m reliable access to capital markets. additionally, the companys maturity profile is staggered to ensure refinancing needs in any given year are reasonable in proportion to the total portfolio. the company has an aa- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from standard& poors and an aa2 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from moodys investors service.
the company generates significant ongoing cash flow, which has been used, in part, to pay dividends on 3m common stock, for acquisitions, and to fund share repurchase activities. as discussed in note 2, in 2011 3m acquired winterthur technologie ag and other acquisitions for approximately $700 million (including purchases of noncontrolling interest). in addition, in the fourth quarter of 2010, the company purchased arizant inc., attenti holdings s.a. and cogent inc. as a result, cash outflows (including repayment of acquired debt, but net of cash and marketable securities acquired) for these three acquisitions totaled approximately $1.4 billion. 3m was able to complete these acquisitions without increasing debt balances, while maintaining a strong cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities position.

the company defines net debt as total debt less cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities. 3m considers net debt to be an important measure of liquidity and its ability to meet ongoing obligations. this measure is not defined under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies.
cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities at december31, 2011 totaled approximately $4.6 billion, helped by cash flows from operating activities of $5.3 billion. the company has sufficient liquidity to meet currently anticipated growth plans, including capital expenditures, working capital investments and acquisitions. at december31, 2011 and 2010, cash and current marketable securities internationally totaled $2.4 billion and $2.3 billion, respectively, and in the united states totaled $1.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively. cash available in the united states has historically been sufficient to fund dividend payments to shareholders and share repurchases, in addition to funding u.s. acquisitions, u.s. capital spending, u.s. pension/other postemployment benefit contributions, and other items as needed. for those international earnings considered to be reinvested indefinitely, the company currently has no intention to repatriate these funds. if these international funds are needed for operations in the u.s., 3m would be required to accrue and pay u.s. taxes to repatriate these funds. however, for the international funds considered to be reinvested indefinitely, 3ms current plans do not indicate a need to repatriate these funds for u.s. operations. refer to note 8 for additional information on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to be reinvested indefinitely.
the companys financial condition and liquidity are strong. various assets and liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. working capital (defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $6.799 billion at december31, 2011, compared with $6.126 billion at december31, 2010, an increase of $673 million. working capital increases were primarily attributable to a decrease in the current portion of long-term debt ($622 million), as increases in short-term marketable securities, accounts receivables, inventories and other current assets were largely offset by decreases in cash and cash equivalents.
primary short-term liquidity needs are met through cash on hand, u.s. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. the company maintains a commercial paper program that allows 3m to have a maximum of $3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of issuance. as of december31, 2011 and 2010, 3m
table of contents
had no outstanding commercial paper. the company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market will be restricted.
in august2011, 3m entered into a $1.5 billion, five-year multi-currency revolving credit agreement, which replaced the existing agreement that was due to expire in april2012. this credit agreement includes a provision under which 3m may request an increase of up to $500 million, bringing the total facility up to $2 billion (at the lenders discretion). this facility was undrawn at december31, 2011. also, in august2011, 3m entered into a $200 million, one-year committed line/letter of credit agreement with hsbc bank usa. this agreement replaced the sublimit for letters of credit that was previously encompassed in the $1.5 billion five-year facility. as of december31, 2011, available committed credit facilities, including the preceding $1.5 billion five-year credit facility and $200 million facility, totaled approximately $1.785 billion worldwide. the amount utilized against these credit facilities totaled $147 million as of december31, 2011. this included $121 million in letters of credit issued under the $200 million facility, $18 million in international lines of credit and $8 million in u.s. lines of credit outstanding with other banking partners. an additional approximately $100 million in stand-alone letters of credit was also issued and outstanding at december31, 2011. these lines/letters of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities. under both the $1.5 billion and $200 million credit agreements, the company is required to maintain its ebitda to interest ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. this is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total ebitda for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. at december31, 2011, this ratio was approximately 40 to 1. debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
the company has a well-known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement, effective august5, 2011, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. the company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes. this replaced 3ms previous shelf registration dated february17, 2009. in september2011, in connection with the august5, 2011 well-known seasoned issuer registration statement, 3m established a $3 billion medium-term notes program (seriesf), from which 3m issued a five-year $1 billion fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 1.375%. proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment in november2011 of $800 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes.
in connection with a prior well-known seasoned issuer shelf registration, in june2007 the company established a $3 billion medium-term notes program. three debt securities have been issued under this medium-term notes program. first, in december2007, 3m issued a five-year, $500 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.65%. second, in august2008, 3m issued a five-year, $850 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.375%. third, in october2008, the company issued a three-year $800 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.50%. the company entered into interest rate swaps to convert this $800 million note to a floating rate. this three-year fixed rate note and related interest rate swaps matured in the fourth quarter of 2011.
3ms cash and cash equivalents balance at december31, 2011 totaled $2.219 billion, with an additional $2.357 billion in current and long-term marketable securities. 3ms strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going forward. the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth, including continual review of acquisition opportunities. 3m paid dividends of $1.555 billion in 2011, and has a long history of dividend increases. in february2012, 3ms board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3m common stock by 7.3 percent to 59 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.36 per share. in february2011, 3ms board of directors also authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion of 3ms outstanding common stock, replacing the companys existing repurchase program. this authorization has no pre-established end date.
in 2012, the company plans to contribute an amount in the range of $800 million to $1 billion of cash to its u.s. and international pension and postretirement plans, with approximately $300 million in each of the first and second quarters. the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2012. therefore, the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the u.s. qualified plans funded status as of the 2012 measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution. future contributions will also depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities.
the company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain working capital assets and liabilities. these measures are not defined under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. one of the primary working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index, which includes accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. this
table of contents
combined index (defined as quarterly net sales  fourth quarter at year-end  multiplied by four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) was 5.0 at december31, 2011, a decline from 5.3 at december31, 2010. receivables increased $252 million, or 7.0 percent, compared with december31, 2010, with higher december2011 sales compared to december2010 sales contributing to this increase. in addition, acquisitions increased accounts receivable by $106 million and currency translation decreased accounts receivable by $59 million. inventories increased $261 million, or 8.3 percent, compared with december31, 2010. the inventory increases are partially attributable to the increase in demand in 2011. in addition, acquisitions increased inventories by $128 million year-on-year, while currency translation decreased inventories by $18 million. accounts payable decreased $19million compared with december31, 2010. acquisitions increased the accounts payable balance by $68 million, while currency translation decreased accounts payable by $5 million.
cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are provided in the tables that follow. individual amounts in the consolidated statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and exchange rate impacts on cash and cash equivalents, which are presented separately in the cash flows. thus, the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted for these effects.
the company revised the amounts previously presented for cash used in investing activities and cash used in financing activities during 2010 by $63 million. this revision related to purchases of additional shares (noncontrolling interest) of non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries. these immaterial revisions increased cash used in financing activities and decreased cash used in investing activities.

cash flows from operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly impact cash flows. in the third quarter of 2009, the company contributed $600 million to its u.s. defined benefit pension plan in shares of the companys common stock, which is considered a non-cash financing activity. this non-cash activity is not reflected in the operating or financing section of the cash flows.
in 2011, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $110 million compared to 2010. the main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to year-on-year increases in net income including noncontrolling interest. two primary items reduced operating cash flows. first, 3m invested in working capital (which includes accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable) in support of its growth. working capital increased $484 million in 2011, with higher december2011 sales compared to december2010 sales contributing to this increase. this compared to working capital increases of $447 million in 2010. second, other-net decreased cash flows by $139 million in 2011 compared to an increase of $279 million in 2010. the category, other-net, in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts, such as a decrease in accrued payroll amounts in 2011 related to certain annual incentives, which reduced liabilities.
in 2010, cash flows provided by operating activities increased $233 million compared to 2009. the main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to year-on-year increases in net income including noncontrolling interest.
table of contents
operating cash flows were reduced by working capital increases of $447 million in 2010, compared to working capital decreases of $617 million in 2009. 3m defines working capital as accounts receivable, inventories and accounts payable. these working capital increases were partially attributable to the rapid increase in demand in 2010. in addition, operating cash flows in 2009 benefited from changes in deferred and accrued income taxes.
free cash flow (non-gaap measure):
in addition, to net cash provided by operating activities, 3m uses free cash flow as a useful measure of performance and as an indication of the strength of the company and its ability to generate cash. 3m defines free cash flow as net cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property, plant and equipment (which is classified as an investing activity). free cash flow is not defined under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles (gaap). therefore, it should not be considered a substitute for income or cash flow data prepared in accordance with u.s. gaap and may not be comparable to similarly titled measures used by other companies. it should not be inferred that the entire free cash flow amount is available for discretionary expenditures. below find a recap of free cash flow for 2011, 2010 and 2009.

investments in property, plant and equipment enable growth across many diverse markets, helping to meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. capital spending increased to $1.379 billion in 2011, compared to $1.091 billion in 2010 and $903 million in 2009. the company expects 2012 capital spending to be approximately $1.3 to $1.5 billion as 3m continues to invest in capacity for future growth. in 2011, a large portion of this investment is addressing supply constraints in a number of businesses with significant growth potential, such as renewable energy, traffic signage in developing economies, and optically clear adhesives and glass bubbles. in addition, some of the following 2010 capital projects carried forward into 2011. in 2010, in the u.s., 3m invested in film manufacturing assets for optical systems and other non-optical businesses which use similar technology. also, in 2010, 3m increased capacity at its multi-purpose manufacturing facility in singapore and invested in optical film capacity in korea. lastly, in 2010, investments in the industrial and transportation business included solar energy in the u.s. and industrial adhesives and tapes in china. in 2009, in response to then-difficult global economic conditions, the company reduced its capital spending significantly.
refer to note 2 for information on acquisitions. the company is actively considering additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may also divest certain businesses.
purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from sale (or maturities) of marketable securities and investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, agency securities, corporate medium-term note securities and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale. interest rate risk and credit risk related to the underlying collateral may impact the value of investments in asset-backed securities, while factors such as general conditions in the overall credit market and the nature of the underlying collateral may affect the liquidity of investments in asset-backed securities. the coupon interest rates for asset-backed securities are either fixed rate or floating.floating rate coupons reset monthly or quarterly based upon the corresponding monthly or quarterly libor rate.each individual floating rate security has a coupon based upon the respective libor rate +/- an amount reflective of the credit risk of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue date.terms of the reset are unique to individual securities.fixed rate coupons are established at the time the security is issued and are based upon a spread to a related maturity treasury bond.the spread against the treasury bond is reflective of the credit risk

of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue date. 3m does not currently expect risk related to its holdings in asset-backed securities to materially impact its financial condition or liquidity. refer to note 9 for more details about 3ms diversified marketable securities portfolio, which totaled $2.357 billion as of december31, 2011. additional purchases of investments include additional survivor benefit insurance and equity investments.

total debt at december31, 2011 was $5.2 billion, compared to $5.5 billion at year-end 2010 and $5.7 billion at year-end 2009. total debt was 25 percent of total capital (total capital is defined as debt plus equity) at both year-end 2011 and year-end 2010, compared with 30 percent at year-end 2009. the net change in short-term debt is typically due to commercial paper activity and international borrowings. in 2011, major items in repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) included redemption of $800 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes in november2011, redemption of convertible notes, repayment of debt related to the 11.6 billion japanese yen note (installments paid in marchand september2011), repayment of the remainder of the canadian dollar loan, and repayment of a portion of debt that was acquired, primarily related to the winterthur acquisition. refer to note 10 for additional information on these debt repayments. in 2010, major items in repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) included repayment of $350 million in dealer remarketable securities, which matured in december2010, and repayment of a portion of debt related to the 5.8 billion japanese yen installment paid on september30, 2010 (refer to notes 6 and 10 for more detail). in addition, approximately $105 million in acquired debt related to 2010 acquisitions was subsequently repaid. in 2009, repayment of debt (maturities greater than 90 days) includes a $400 million medium-term note that matured in november2009 and also includes repayments of commercial paper. in 2011, proceeds from debt (maturities greater than 90 days) primarily related to the issuance of a $1 billion medium term note and an amendment to a canada loan agreement which increased the principal amount of the loan by 100.5 million canadian dollars. in 2010, proceeds from debt primarily include a 100.5 million canadian dollar loan.
repurchases of common stock are made to support the companys stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. in february2011, 3ms board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to $7.0 billion of 3ms outstanding common stock, replacing the companys existing repurchase program. this authorization has no pre-established end date. in 2011, the company purchased $2.701 billion in shares and in 2010 the company purchased $854 million in shares, while in 2009 purchases were minimal as the company had no broker purchases of treasury stock. for more information, refer to the table titled issuer purchases of equity securities in partii,item 5. the company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to the companys stock.
cash dividends paid to shareholders totaled $1.555 billion ($2.20 per share) in 2011, $1.500 billion ($2.10 per share) in 2010 and $1.431 billion ($2.04 per share) in 2009. 3m has paid dividends since 1916. in february2012, the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3m common stock by 7.3 percent to 59 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.36 per share. this marked the 54th consecutive year of dividend increases.
in addition to the items described below, other cash flows from financing activities may include various other items, such as distributions to or sales of noncontrolling interests, changes in cash overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases.
in 2011, as discussed in note 6, subsequent to acquiring a controlling interest in winterthur, 3m purchased additional outstanding shares of its winterthur subsidiary for $57 million, increasing 3ms ownership interest from approximately 86 percent to 100 percent as of december31, 2011. these additional purchases are reflected as other financing activities in the statement of cash flows. in addition, during 2011, 3m sold a noncontrolling interest in a newly formed
table of contents
subsidiary for an immaterial amount, which was also classified as other financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
during the quarter ended march31, 2010, as discussed in notes 6 and 10, the companys majority owned sumitomo 3m limited entity (sumitomo 3m) purchased a portion of its shares held by its noncontrolling interest, sumitomo electric industries,ltd. (sei), by paying cash of 5.8 billion japanese yen and entering into a note payable to sei of 17.4 billion japanese yen (approximately $63 million and $188 million, respectively, based on applicable exchange rates at that time). the cash paid of approximately $63 million during the quarter ended march31, 2010 as a result of the purchase of sumitomo 3m shares from sei is classified as other financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows. the remainder of the purchase financed by the note payable to sei is considered non-cash financing activity in the first quarter of 2010. as discussed in note 2, during the second quarter of 2010, 3m recorded a financed liability of 1.7 billion japanese yen (approximately $18 million based on applicable exchange rates at that time) related to the a-one acquisition, which is also considered a non-cash financing activity.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations:
as of december31, 2011, the company has not utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing arrangements. refer to the section entitled warranties/guarantees in note 14 for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees.
in addition to guarantees, 3m, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into agreements that require the company to indemnify either major customers or suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel, or claims alleging that 3m products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual property. while 3ms maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material impact on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
a summary of the companys significant contractual obligations as of december31, 2011, follows:

long-term debt payments due in 2012 include $59 million of floating rate notes. the floating rate notes are classified as current portion of long-term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. as a result of put provisions, long-term debt payments due in 2013 include floating rate notes totaling $73 million, and in 2014 include floating rate notes totaling $97 million.
unconditional purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is enforceable and legally binding on the company. included in the unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one year. many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold to customers. the company expects to receive consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but these commitments represent a small part of the companys expected capital spending in 2012 and beyond. the purchase obligation amounts do not represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only those items for which the company is contractually obligated. the majority of 3ms products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional commitment. for this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator of the companys expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.
table of contents
other obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled unconditional purchase obligations and other, include the current portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under asc 740, which is expected to be paid out in cash in the next 12 months. the company is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term portion of the net tax liability of $230 million is excluded from the preceding table. refer to note 8 for further details.
as discussed in note 11, the company does not have a required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2012 and company contributions to its u.s. and international pension plans are expected to be largely discretionary in future years; therefore, amounts related to these plans are not included in the preceding table.
financial instruments
the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure, interest rate risks and commodity price risks. a financial risk management committee, composed of senior management, provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities. this committee determines the companys financial risk policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. this committee also establishes procedures for control and valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. to help manage borrowing costs, the company may enter into interest rate swaps. under these arrangements, the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts.
a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the companys exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in after-tax earnings of financial instruments, derivatives and underlying exposures outstanding at december31, 2011. the model (third-party bank dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. the model used analyzed 18 currencies, interest rates related to two currencies, and five commodities, but does not purport to represent what actually will be experienced by the company. this model does not include certain hedge transactions, because the company believes their inclusion would not materially impact the results. foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit increased in 2011, primarily due to increases in exposures, which is one of the key drivers in the valuation model. interest rate volatility decreased in 2011 because interest rates are currently very low and are projected to remain low, based on forward rates. the following table summarizes the possible adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures.

the global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a 1 percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $71 million per year. the global energy exposure is such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $43 million per year. derivative instruments are used to hedge approximately 1 percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately 10 percent of this energy exposure.

item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
in the context of item 7a, market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in financial and derivative instrument market rates and prices, such as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. the company discusses risk management in various places throughout this document, including discussions in item 7 concerning financial condition and liquidity, and financial instruments, and in the notes to consolidated financial statements (long-term debt and short-term borrowings, derivatives, fair value measurements, and the derivatives and hedging activities accounting policy). all derivative activity is governed by written policies, and a value-at-risk analysis is provided for these derivatives. the company does not have leveraged derivative positions.

report of independent registered public accounting firm
to the stockholders and board of directors of 3m company
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in the accompanying index present fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 3m company and its subsidiaries (the company) at december31, 2011 and december31, 2010, and the results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended december31, 2011 in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2011, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). the companys management is responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated audits. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audits of the financial statements included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. also, projections of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

notes to consolidated financial statements
note 1. significant accounting policies
consolidation: 3m is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. all subsidiaries are consolidated. all significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. as used herein, the term 3m or company refers to 3m company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.
foreign currency translation: local currencies generally are considered the functional currencies outside the united states. assets and liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at year-end exchange rates. income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity.
although local currencies are typically considered as the functional currencies outside the united states, under accounting standards codification (asc) 830, foreign currency matters, the reporting currency of a foreign entitys parent is assumed to be that entitys functional currency when the economic environment of a foreign entity is highly inflationarygenerally when its cumulative inflation is approximately 100 percent or more for the three years that precede the beginning of a reporting period. 3m has a subsidiary in venezuela with operating income representing less than 1.0 percent of 3ms consolidated operating income for 2011. 3m determined that the cumulative inflation rate of venezuela in november2009 and since has exceeded 100 percent. accordingly, the financial statements of the venezuelan subsidiary were remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent beginning january1, 2010.
regulations in venezuela require the purchase and sale of foreign currency to be made at official rates of exchange that are fixed from time to time by the venezuelan government. certain laws in the country, however, provided an exemption for the purchase and sale of certain securities and resulted in an indirect parallel market through which companies obtained foreign currency without having to purchase it from venezuelas commission for the administration of foreign exchange (cadivi). in may2010, the venezuelan government took control of the previously freely-traded parallel market. the government-controlled rate that emerged under the new transaction system for foreign currency denominated securities (sitme) is not as unfavorable as the previous parallel rate in comparison to the official rates. as previously disclosed, as of december31, 2009 (prior to the change in functional currency of 3ms venezuelan subsidiary in january2010), 3m changed to use of the parallel exchange rate for translation of the financial statements of its venezuelan subsidiary. beginning january1, 2010, as discussed above, the financial statements of the venezuelan subsidiary are remeasured as if its functional currency were that of its parent. this remeasurement utilized the parallel rate through may2010 and the sitme rate thereafter.
the company continues to monitor circumstances relative to its venezuelan subsidiary. other factors notwithstanding, the change in functional currency of this subsidiary and associated remeasurement beginning january1, 2010 as a result of venezuelas economic environment decreased net sales of the venezuelan subsidiary by approximately two-thirds in 2010 in comparison to 2009 (based on exchange rates at 2009 year-end), but did not otherwise have a material impact on operating income and 3ms consolidated results of operations.
reclassifications: certain amounts in the prior years consolidated financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
revisions: the company revised the amounts previously presented for cash used in investing activities and cash used in financing activities for the year ended december31, 2010 by $63 million. this revision related to purchases of additional shares (noncontrolling interest) of non-wholly owned consolidated subsidiaries. these immaterial revisions increased cash used in financing activities and decreased cash used in investing activities.
use of estimates: the preparation of financial statements in conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from these estimates.
cash and cash equivalents: cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when acquired.
table of contents
marketable securities: the classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is dependent upon managements intended holding period, the securitys maturity date and liquidity considerations based on market conditions. if management intends to hold the securities for longer than one year as of the balance sheet date, they are classified as non-current. 3m reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by asc 320,investments-debt and equity securities, when determining the classification of the impairment as temporary or other-than-temporary. a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity. such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. the factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors.
investments: investments primarily include equity and cost method investments, available-for-sale equity investments and real estate not used in the business. available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value. unrealized gains and losses relating to investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders equity.
other assets: other assets include deferred income taxes, product and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance policies, and other long-term assets. investments in life insurance are reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. cash outflows and inflows associated with life insurance activity are included in purchases of marketable securities and investments and proceeds from sale of marketable securities and investments, respectively.
inventories: inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
property, plant and equipment: property, plant and equipment, including capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost. depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. the estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from 10 to 40 years, with the majority in the range of 20 to 40 years. the estimated useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to 15 years, with the majority in the range of five to 10 years. fully depreciated assets are retained in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or credited to operations. property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value. fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis.
conditional asset retirement obligations: a liability is initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. conditional asset retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the company. the obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value techniques. over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the remaining useful lives of the related assets. the asset retirement obligation liability was $79 million and $74 million, respectively, at december31, 2011 and 2010.
goodwill: goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. goodwill is not amortized. goodwill is tested for impairment annually in the fourth quarter of each year, and is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. reporting units are one level below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing. an impairment loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. the estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. the price/earnings ratio is adjusted, if necessary, to take into consideration the market value of the company.
table of contents
intangible assets: intangible assets include patents, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an independent party. intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames, are not amortized. intangible assets with a definite life are amortized generally on a straight-line basis, with useful lives ranging from one to 20 years. indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, and are tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining the fair value of the asset. the amount of the impairment loss recorded is calculated by the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value. fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. costs related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, primarily in research, development and related expenses.
restructuring actions: restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairment of assets associated with such actions. employee-related severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and substantive severance plans. these charges are reflected in the quarter when the actions are probable and the amounts are estimable, which typically is when management approves the associated actions. severance amounts for which affected employees were required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as expense over the employees remaining service periods. contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the company. asset impairment charges related to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets carrying values over their fair values.
revenue (sales) recognition: the company sells a wide range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no material concentration of credit risk. revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have substantively transferred to customers. this condition normally is met when the product has been delivered or upon performance of services. the company records estimated reductions to revenue or records expense for customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates and free goods, at the time of the initial sale. these sales incentives are accounted for in accordance with asc 605, revenue recognition. the estimated reductions of revenue for rebates are based on the sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. since the company serves numerous markets, the rebate programs offered vary across businesses, but the most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. free goods are accounted for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. sales, use, value-added and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue.
the vast majority of 3ms sales agreements are for standard products and services with customer acceptance occurring upon delivery of the product or performance of the service. however, to a limited extent 3m also enters into agreements that involve multiple elements (such as equipment, installation and service), software, or non-standard terms and conditions.
for non-software multiple-element arrangements, in connection with 3ms prospective adoption of accounting standards updated (asu) no.2009-13, multiple-deliverable revenue arrangementsa consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force, to new or materially modified arrangements beginning in 2011, the company recognizes revenue for delivered elements when they have stand-alone value to the customer, they have been accepted by the customer, and for which there are only customary refund or return rights. arrangement consideration is allocated to the deliverables by use of the relative selling price method. the selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (vsoe) if available, third-party evidence (tpe) if vsoe is not available, or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. estimated selling price is determined in a manner consistent with that used to establish the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. for applicable pre-existing arrangements, 3m recognizes revenue for delivered elements when the fair values of the undelivered items are known and allocation of consideration to the delivered items is most often based on the residual method. in addition to the preceding conditions under asu no.2009-13 and for applicable pre-existing arrangements, equipment revenue is not recorded until the installation has been completed if equipment acceptance is dependent upon installation or if installation is essential to the functionality of the equipment. installation revenues are not recorded until installation has been completed.
for arrangements (or portions of arrangements) falling within software revenue recognition standards and that do not involve significant production, modification, or customization, revenue for each software or software-related element
table of contents
is recognized when the company has vsoe of the fair value of all of the undelivered elements and applicable criteria have been met for the delivered elements. when the arrangements involve significant production, modification or customization, long-term construction-type accounting involving proportional performance is generally employed.
for prepaid service contracts, sales revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, unless historical evidence indicates the costs are incurred on other than a straight-line basis. license fee revenue is recognized as earned, and no revenue is recognized until the inception of the license term.
on occasion, agreements will contain milestones, or 3m will recognize revenue based on proportional performance. for these agreements, and depending on the specifics, 3m may recognize revenue upon completion of a substantive milestone, or in proportion to costs incurred to date compared with the estimate of total costs to be incurred.
accounts receivable and allowances: trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. the company maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other items. the allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns is based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable and anticipated sales returns. the company determines the allowances based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data and historical sales returns. the company reviews the allowance for doubtful accounts monthly. the company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.
advertising and merchandising: these costs are charged to operations in the period incurred, and totaled $518 million in 2011, $512 million in 2010 and $414 million in 2009.
research, development and related expenses: these costs are charged to operations in the period incurred and are shown on a separate line of the consolidated statement of income. research, development and related expenses totaled $1.570 billion in 2011, $1.434 billion in 2010 and $1.293 billion in 2009. research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $1.036 billion in 2011, $919 million in 2010 and $838 million in 2009. related expenses primarily include technical support provided by 3m to customers who are using existing 3m products; internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file, secure and maintain patents; and amortization of acquired patents.
internal-use software: the company capitalizes direct costs of materials and services used in the development of internal-use software. amounts capitalized are amortized over a period of three to seven years, generally on a straight-line basis, unless another systematic and rational basis is more representative of the softwares use. amounts are reported as a component of either machinery and equipment or capital leases within property, plant and equipment.
environmental: environmental expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. reserves for liabilities related to anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the companys commitment to a plan of action. environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.
income taxes: the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and liability approach. under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty regarding their realizability exists. as of december31, 2011 and 2010, the company recorded $82 million and $128 million, respectively, of valuation allowances. the company follows accounting guidance related to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes to record uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions (refer to note 8 for additional information).
earnings per share: the difference in the weighted average 3m shares outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable to 3m common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the companys stock-based compensation plans. certain options outstanding under these stock-based compensation plans during the years 2011, 2010 and 2009 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to 3m common shareholders because they would not have had a dilutive effect (17.4 million average options for 2011, 26.3 million average options for 2010, and 54.3 million average options for 2009). as discussed in note 10, the conditions for conversion related to the companys convertible notes were not met. if the conditions for conversion were met, 3m could have chosen to pay in cash and/or common stock; however, if this occurred, the
table of contents
company had the intent and ability to settle this debt security in cash. accordingly, there was no impact on diluted earnings per share attributable to 3m common shareholders. as discussed in note 10, in september2011, 3m redeemed all remaining convertible notes, which were otherwise due in 2032. the computations for basic and diluted earnings per share for the years ended december31 follow:

stock-based compensation: the company recognizes compensation expense for its stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and the general employees stock purchase plan (gespp). under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of the related expense is recorded over the period in which the share-based compensation vests. refer to note 16 for additional information.
comprehensive income: total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and the consolidated statement of changes in equity. accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in international companies), defined benefit pension and postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity securities, and unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments.
derivatives and hedging activities: all derivative instruments within the scope of asc 815, derivatives and hedging, are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. the company uses interest rate swaps, currency and commodity price swaps, and foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. all hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. if the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current earnings. instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. cash flows from derivative instruments are classified in the statement of cash flows in the same category as the cash flows from the items subject to designated hedge or undesignated (economic) hedge relationships. the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a party to leveraged derivatives.
credit risk: the company is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts. however, the companys risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. the company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. 3m enters into master netting agreements with counterparties when possible to mitigate credit risk in derivative transactions. a master netting arrangement may allow counterparties to net settle amounts owed to each other as a result of multiple, separate derivative transactions. the company does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3m has credit support agreements in place with two of its primary derivatives counterparties. under these agreements, either party is required to post eligible collateral when the market value of transactions covered by these agreements exceeds specified thresholds, thus limiting credit exposure for both parties. for presentation purposes on 3ms consolidated balance sheet, the fair value of derivative assets or liabilities are presented on a gross basis even when derivative transactions are subject to master netting arrangements and may qualify for net presentation.
fair value measurements: 3m follows asc 820, fair value measurements and disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. under the standard, fair
table of contents
value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. the standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company. unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the companys assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. the hierarchy is broken down into three levels. level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
acquisitions: the company accounts for business acquisitions in accordance with asc 805, business combinations. this standard requires the acquiring entity in a business combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date fair value as the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. certain provisions of this standard prescribe, among other things, the determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination (including contingent consideration) and the exclusion of transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs from acquisition accounting. 3m applies this standard to business combinations and adjustments to an acquired entitys deferred tax asset and liability balances occurring after december31, 2008. pre-2009 business combinations were accounted for under a former standard which, among other aspects, required transaction and acquisition-related restructuring costs to be included in the acquisition purchase accounting and did not require the recognition of certain contingent consideration as of the acquisition date.
new accounting pronouncements
in april2009, the fasb issued three accounting standards which (1)provide guidance on estimating the fair value of an asset or liability when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have significantly declined and identifying transactions that are not orderly, (2)modify the requirements for recognizing other-than-temporarily impaired debt securities and change the impairment model for such securities, and (3)add additional disclosure requirements with respect to fair value measurements including disclosures in interim periods. for 3m, these standards were effective beginning april1, 2009. the company discloses the additional required information. the other aspects of these standards did not have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in june2009, the fasb issued a new standard regarding the accounting for transfers of financial assets amending the existing guidance on transfers of financial assets to, among other things, eliminate the qualifying special-purpose entity concept, include a new unit of account definition that must be met for transfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for sale accounting, clarify and change the derecognition criteria for a transfer to be accounted for as a sale, and require significant additional disclosure. for 3m, this standard was effective for new transfers of financial assets beginning january1, 2010. because 3m does not have significant transfers of financial assets, the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in june2009, the fasb issued a new standard that revises the consolidation guidance for variable-interest entities. the modifications include the elimination of the exemption for qualifying special purpose entities, a new approach for determining who should consolidate a variable-interest entity, and changes to when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a variable-interest entity. for 3m, this standard was effective january1, 2010. the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in august2009, the fasb issued accounting standards update (asu) no.2009-05, measuring liabilities at fair value, which provides additional guidance on how companies should measure liabilities at fair value under asc 820. the asu clarifies that the quoted price for an identical liability should be used. however, if such information is not available, a entity may use the quoted price of an identical liability when traded as an asset, quoted prices for similar liabilities or similar liabilities traded as assets, or another valuation technique (such as the market or income approach). the asu also indicates that the fair value of a liability is not adjusted to reflect the impact of contractual restrictions that prevent its transfer and indicates circumstances in which quoted prices for an identical liability or quoted price for an identical liability traded as an asset may be considered level 1 fair value measurements (see note 13 for a description of level 1 measurements). for 3m, this asu was effective october1, 2009. the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
table of contents
in september2009, the fasb issued asu no.2009-12,investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent), that amends asc 820 to provide guidance on measuring the fair value of certain alternative investments such as hedge funds, private equity funds and venture capital funds. the asu indicates that, under certain circumstances, the fair value of such investments may be determined using net asset value (nav) as a practical expedient, unless it is probable the investment will be sold at something other than nav. in those situations, the practical expedient cannot be used and disclosure of the remaining actions necessary to complete the sale is required. the asu also requires additional disclosures of the attributes of all investments within the scope of the new guidance, regardless of whether an entity used the practical expedient to measure the fair value of any of its investments. the disclosure provisions of this asu are not applicable to an employers disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets. 3m does not have any significant direct investments within the scope of asu no.2009-12, but certain plan assets of the companys benefit plans are valued based on nav as indicated in note 11. for 3m, this asu was effective october1, 2009. the adoption of this asu did not have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in october2009, the fasb issued asu no.2009-13, multiple-deliverable revenue arrangementsa consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force, that provides amendments to the criteria for separating consideration in multiple-deliverable arrangements. as a result of these amendments, multiple-deliverable revenue arrangements are separated in more circumstances than under pre-existing u.s. gaap. the asu does this by establishing a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a deliverable. the selling price used for each deliverable is based on vendor-specific objective evidence (vsoe) if available, third-party evidence (tpe) if vsoe is not available, or estimated selling price if neither vsoe nor tpe is available. a vendor is required to determine its best estimate of selling price in a manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the deliverable on a standalone basis. this asu also eliminates the residual method of allocation and requires that arrangement consideration be allocated at the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling price method, which allocates any discount in the overall arrangement proportionally to each deliverable based on its relative selling price. the asu does not apply to arrangements for which industry specific allocation and measurement guidance exists, such as long-term construction contracts and software transactions. for 3m, asu no.2009-13 was effective beginning january1, 2011. 3m elected to adopt the provisions of this standard prospectively to new or materially modified arrangements beginning on the effective date. the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in october2009, the fasb issued asu no.2009-14, certain revenue arrangements that include software elementsa consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force, that reduces the types of transactions that fall within the scope of software revenue recognition guidance. pre-existing software revenue recognition guidance required that its provisions be applied to an entire arrangement involving the sale of any products or services containing or utilizing software when the software was considered more than incidental to the product or service. as a result of the amendments included in asu no.2009-14, many tangible products and services that rely on software are accounted for under the multiple-element arrangements revenue recognition guidance rather than under the software revenue recognition guidance. under the asu, the following components are excluded from the scope of software revenue recognition guidance: the tangible element of the product, software products bundled with tangible products where the software components and non-software components function together to deliver the products essential functionality, and undelivered components that relate to software that is essential to the tangible products functionality. the asu also provides guidance on how to allocate transaction consideration when an arrangement contains both deliverables within the scope of software revenue guidance (software deliverables) and deliverables not within the scope of that guidance (non-software deliverables). for 3m, asu no.2009-14 was effective beginning january1, 2011. 3m elected to adopt the provisions of this standard prospectively to new or materially modified arrangements beginning on the effective date. the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in january2010, the fasb issued asu no.2010-06,improving disclosures about fair value measurements, that amends pre-existing disclosure requirements under asc 820 by adding required disclosures about items transferring into and out of levels 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy; adding separate disclosures about purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements relative to level 3 measurements; and clarifying, among other things, the pre-existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation. for 3m, this asu was effective for the first quarter of 2010, except for the requirement to provide level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a gross basis, which was effective beginning the first quarter of 2011. since this standard impacts disclosure requirements only, its adoption did not have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in april2010, the fasb issued asu no.2010-17, milestone method of revenue recognitiona consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force that recognizes the milestone method as an acceptable revenue recognition
table of contents
method for substantive milestones in research or development arrangements. this standard requires its provisions be met in order for an entity to recognize consideration that is contingent upon achievement of a substantive milestone as revenue in its entirety in the period in which the milestone is achieved. in addition, this asu requires disclosure of certain information with respect to arrangements that contain milestones. for 3m, this standard was effective prospectively beginning january1, 2011. the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in may2011, the fasb issued asu no.2011-04, fair value measurement: amendments to achieve common fair value measurement and disclosure requirements in u.s. gaap and ifrss. this standard clarifies guidance on how to measure fair value and is largely consistent with existing fair value measurement principles. the asu also expands existing disclosure requirements for fair value measurements and makes other amendments. for 3m, this asu is effective prospectively beginning january1, 2012. the adoption of this standard is not expected to have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in june2011, the fasb issued asu no.2011-05, presentation of comprehensive income, and in december2011 issued asu no.2011-12, deferral of the effective date for amendments to the presentation of reclassification of items out of accumulated other comprehensive income in accounting standards update no.2011-05. these standards require entities to present items of net income and other comprehensive income either in a single continuous statement, or in separate, but consecutive, statements of net income and other comprehensive income. the new requirements do not change which components of comprehensive income are recognized in net income or other comprehensive income, or when an item of other comprehensive income must be reclassified to net income. also, the earnings-per share computation does not change. however, the current option under existing standards to report other comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes in equity is eliminated. for 3m, these standards are effective retrospectively beginning january1, 2012, with early adoption permitted. 3m adopted these standards in the fourth quarter of 2011. since these standards impact presentation and disclosure requirements only, their adoption did not have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in september2011, the fasb issued asu no.2011-08, testing goodwill for impairment. under this new standard, entities testing goodwill for impairment now have an option of performing a qualitative assessment before having to calculate the fair value of a reporting unit. if an entity determines, on the basis of qualitative factors, that the fair value of the reporting unit is more-likely-than-not less than the carrying amount, the existing quantitative impairment test is required. otherwise, no further impairment testing is required. for 3m, this asu is effective beginning january1, 2012, with early adoption permitted under certain conditions. the adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in december2011, the fasb issued asu no.2011-11, disclosures about offsetting assets and liabilities, which creates new disclosure requirements regarding the nature of an entitys rights of setoff and related arrangements associated with its financial instruments and derivative instruments. certain disclosures of the amounts of certain instruments subject to enforceable master netting arrangements or similar agreements would be required, irrespective of whether the entity has elected to offset those instruments in the statement of financial position. for 3m, the asu is effective january1, 2013 with retrospective application required. since this standard impacts disclosure requirements only, its adoption will not have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

goodwill resulting from business combinations is largely attributable to the existing workforce of the acquired businesses and synergies expected to arise after 3ms acquisition of these businesses. in-process research and development associated with these business combinations were not material. pro forma information related to acquisitions was not included because the impact on the companys consolidated results of operations was not considered to be material.
in addition to business combinations, 3m periodically acquires certain tangible and/or intangible assets and purchases interests in certain enterprises that do not otherwise qualify for accounting as business combinations. these transactions are largely reflected as additional asset purchase and investment activity.

as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements, effective in the first quarter of 2011, 3m made certain product moves between its business segments, with the resulting impact reflected in the goodwill balances by business segment above for all periods presented. for those changes that resulted in reporting unit changes, the company applied the relative fair value method to determine the impact to reporting units. during the first quarter of 2011, the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined that no impairment existed. the company also completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2011 for all reporting units and determined that no impairment existed. in addition, the company had no impairments of goodwill in prior years.
table of contents
as discussed in note 13, in june2009, 3m tested the long lived assets grouping associated with the u.k. passport production activity of 3ms security systems division for recoverability. this circumstance required the company to also test goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit (security systems division) level. 3m completed its assessment of potential goodwill impairment for this reporting unit and determined that no goodwill impairment existed as of june30, 2009.
acquired intangible assets
for 2011, intangible assets (excluding goodwill) acquired through business combinations increased the gross carrying amount by $342 million. balances are also impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates. the gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization of acquired intangible assets as of december31 follow:

note 4. restructuring actions
restructuring actions generally include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges, contract termination costs, and impairment of assets associated with such actions. accounting policies related to these activities are discussed in note 1.
the following provides information concerning the companys 2009 restructuring actions.
2009 restructuring actions:
during the first nine months of 2009, management approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions. due to the rapid decline in global business activity in the fourth quarter of 2008 and into the first three quarters of 2009, 3m aggressively reduced its cost structure and rationalized several facilities, including manufacturing, technical and office facilities. these actions included all geographies, with particular attention in the developed areas of the world that have and are experiencing large declines in business activity, and included the following actions during 2009:
during the first quarter of 2009, 3m announced the elimination of approximately 1,200 positions. of these employment reductions, about 43 percent were in the united states, 36 percent in latin america, 16 percent
table of contents
in europe and 5 percent in the asia pacific area. these restructuring actions resulted in a first-quarter 2009 pre-tax charge of $67 million, with $61 million for employee-related items/benefits and $6 million related to fixed asset impairments. the preceding charges were recorded in cost of sales ($17 million), selling, general and administrative expenses ($47 million), and research, development and related expenses ($3 million).
during the second quarter of 2009, 3m announced the permanent reduction of approximately 900 positions, the majority of which were concentrated in the united states, western europe and japan. in the united states, another 700 people accepted a voluntary early retirement incentive program offer, which resulted in a $21 million non-cash charge. of these aggregate employment reductions, about 66 percent were in the united states, 17 percent in the asia pacific area, 14 percent in europe and 3 percent in latin america and canada. these restructuring actions in total resulted in a second-quarter 2009 pre-tax charge of $116 million, with $103 million for employee-related items/benefits and $13 million related to fixed asset impairments. the preceding charges were recorded in cost of sales ($68 million), selling, general and administrative expenses ($44 million), and research, development and related expenses ($4 million).
during the third quarter of 2009, 3m announced the elimination of approximately 200 positions, with the majority of those occurring in western europe and, to a lesser extent, the united states. these restructuring actions, including a non-cash charge related to a pension settlement in japan, resulted in a third-quarter 2009 net pre-tax charge of $26 million for employee-related items/benefits and other, which is net of $7 million of adjustments to prior 2008 and 2009 restructuring actions. the preceding charges were recorded in cost of sales ($25 million) and research, development and related expenses ($1 million).

reclassification adjustments are made to avoid double counting in comprehensive income items that are also recorded as part of net income. reclassifications to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income including noncontrolling interest that related to pension and postretirement expense in the income statement were $475 million pre-tax ($307 million after-tax) in 2011, $306 million pre-tax ($197 million after-tax) in 2010, and $141 million pre-tax ($92 million after-tax) in 2009. these pension and postretirement expense pre-tax amounts are shown in the table in note 11 as amortization of transition (asset) obligation, amortization of prior service cost (benefit) and amortization of net actuarial (gain) loss. cash flow hedging instruments reclassifications are provided in note 12. reclassifications to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income for debt and equity securities were $10 million pre-tax ($6 million after-tax) in 2011, not material for 2010, and as shown in the auction rate securities table in note 13, primarily relate to a loss of approximately $2 million pre-tax for 2009. other reclassification adjustments were not material. income taxes are not provided for foreign translation relating to permanent investments in international subsidiaries, but tax effects within cumulative translation do include impacts from items such as net investment hedge transactions.

purchase and sale of subsidiary shares and transfers of ownership interests involving non-wholly owned subsidiaries
as discussed in note 2, in early march2011, 3m acquired a controlling interest in winterthur technologie ag (winterthur), making winterthur a consolidated subsidiary as of that business acquisition date. subsequent to this business acquisition date, 3m purchased additional outstanding shares of its winterthur subsidiary increasing 3ms ownership interest from approximately 86 percent as of the business acquisition date to 100 percent as of december31, 2011. the $57 million of cash paid in 2011 as a result of these additional purchases of winterthur shares was classified as other financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. these additional purchases did not result in a material transfer from noncontrolling interest to 3m company shareholders equity. in addition, during 2011, 3m sold a noncontrolling interest in a newly formed subsidiary for an immaterial amount, which was also classified as other financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows.
during the second half of 2009 and the first half of 2010, 3m effected a purchase of subsidiary shares and transfers of ownership interests to align activities in japan and to simplify the companys ownership structure. as a result of these activities, beginning in june2010 the company has a wholly owned subsidiary in the region in addition to its majority owned sumitomo 3m limited entity (sumitomo 3m). because the company retained its controlling interest in the subsidiaries involved, these activities resulted in changes to 3m company shareholders equity and noncontrolling interest. these activities included the following:
during the second half of 2009, a wholly owned subsidiary that, in turn, owned a portion of the companys majority owned sumitomo 3m, was transferred to another subsidiary (referred to herein as 3m hc) that was majority, rather than wholly, owned. sumitomo 3m also owned a portion of 3m hc. as a result of the transaction, 3ms effective ownership in sumitomo 3m was reduced from 75 percent to 71.5 percent. the transfer resulted in a decrease in 3m company shareholders equity and an increase in noncontrolling interest of $81 million in the second half of 2009.
during the first quarter of 2010, majority owned 3m hc which, as a result of the transfer above owned a portion of the companys majority owned sumitomo 3m, transferred this interest to sumitomo 3m. in addition, sumitomo 3m purchased a portion of its shares held by its noncontrolling interest, sumitomo electric industries,ltd. (sei), by paying cash of 5.8 billion japanese yen and entering into a note payable to sei of 17.4 billion japanese yen (approximately $63 million and $188 million, respectively, based on applicable exchange rates at that time). as a result of these transactions, 3ms effective ownership in sumitomo 3m was increased from 71.5 percent to 75 percent. the cash paid as a result of the purchase of sumitomo 3m shares from sei was classified as other financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. the remainder of the purchase financed by the note payable to sei was considered non-cash financing activity in the first quarter of 2010. these transactions resulted in an increase in 3m company shareholders equity of $22 million and a decrease in noncontrolling interest of $278 million in the first quarter of 2010.
during the second quarter of 2010, majority owned sumitomo 3m transferred its interest in 3m hc to 3m hc. as a result of this transaction, 3m hc became wholly owned by the company. the transfer resulted in an increase in 3m company shareholders equity and a decrease in noncontrolling interest of $24 million in the second quarter of 2010.
3m also acquired the remaining noncontrolling interest of a previously majority owned subsidiary for an immaterial amount during the first half of 2010. in addition, as discussed in note 2, in october2010 3m acquired a controlling interest in cogent inc. via a tender offer and in december2010 completed a second-step merger for the same amount per outstanding share as the tender offer, thereby acquiring the remaining noncontrolling interest in cogent inc. the resulting october2010 increase and december2010 decrease in noncontrolling interest associated with the cogent inc. transactions are presented netting to zero with respect to the amount impacting noncontrolling interest in the consolidated statement of changes in equity. however, the december2010 transaction resulted in an immaterial transfer from noncontrolling interest to 3m company shareholders equity.

transactions related to investing and financing activities with significant non-cash components are as follows:
during 2010, sumitomo 3m purchased a portion of its shares held by its noncontrolling interest, sumitomo electric industries,ltd. (sei), by paying cash of 5.8 billion japanese yen and entering into a note payable to sei of 17.4 billion japanese yen. the cash paid as a result of the purchase of sumitomo 3m shares from sei was classified as other financing activity in the consolidated statement of cash flows. the remainder of the purchase financed by the note payable to sei was considered non-cash financing activity in the first quarter of 2010. this is described in note 6 in the section entitled purchase and sale of subsidiary shares and transfers of ownership interests involving non-wholly owned subsidiaries.
also in 2010, as discussed in note 2, the company recorded a financed liability of 1.7 billion japanese yen related to the a-one acquisition.
during 2009, 3m recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately $50 million related to an it investment with an amortization period of seven years and contributed $600 million to its u.s. defined benefit pension plan in shares of the companys common stock.

as of december31, 2011, the company had tax effected federal, state, and international operating loss, capital loss, and tax credit carryovers of approximately $17 million, $9 million, and $366 million (before valuation allowances). the federal tax attribute carryovers will expire after eighteen to nineteen years, the state after five to ten years, and the majority of international after eight years with the remaining international expiring in one year or with an indefinite carryover period. the tax attributes being carried over arise as certain jurisdictions may have tax losses or may have inabilities to utilize certain losses without the same type of taxable income. the company has provided $82 million of valuation allowance against certain of these deferred tax assets based on managements determination that it is more-likely-than-not that the tax benefits related to these assets will not be realized. the valuation allowance has decreased from prior year due mainly to a change in tax law in certain jurisdictions extending the carryforward period for which these tax attributes can be used to reduce the same type of taxable income. it is reasonably possible that the valuation allowance will be reduced within the next 12 months as a result of the potential closure of audits with certain taxing authorities.

the effective tax rate for 2011 was 27.8 percent, compared to 27.7 percent in 2010, an increase of 0.1 percent. the year-on-year change in international income taxes increased the effective tax rate for 2011 when compared to 2010 by approximately 2.5 percent, which includes a partial offsetting benefit from the corporate reorganization of a wholly owned international subsidiary in 2011. this 2.5 percent net increase was due primarily to certain 2010 tax benefits, which did not repeat in 2011, related to net operating losses partially offset by a valuation allowance resulting from the 2010 corporate alignment transactions that allowed the company to increase its ownership of a foreign subsidiary. these transactions are described in the section of note 6 entitled purchase and sale of subsidiary shares and transfers of ownership interest involving non-wholly owned subsidiaries. other significant items impacting the year-on-year comparison include a one-time 2010 income tax charge of $84 million (discussed further below), which benefited the 2011 tax rate when compared to 2010 by 1.5 percent, as this charge did not repeat in 2011. the companys effective tax rate also benefited during 2011 when compared to 2010 by approximately 0.7 percent from adjustments to its income tax reserves.
the effective tax rate for 2010 was 27.7 percent, compared to 30.0 percent in 2009, a decrease of 2.3 percent. this included an approximately 1.8 percent decrease related to the year-on-year change in international income taxes, due primarily to the 2010 corporate alignment transactions discussed above. additionally, the companys effective tax rate benefited in 2010 compared to 2009 by approximately 1.3 percent from adjustments to its income tax reserves, and by approximately 0.9 percent from additional domestic manufacturers deductions. these benefits were partially offset by a 1.5 percent increase related to the one-time 2010 income tax charge of $84 million (discussed below).
under a federal program (medicare modernization act) that was established to encourage companies to provide retiree prescription drug coverage, many companies, including 3m, received a tax-advantaged subsidy.the tax advantage of the subsidy was eliminated by the patient protection and affordable care act (h.r. 3590), including modifications included in the health care and education reconciliation act of 2010 (collectively, the act), which were enacted in march2010. although the elimination of this tax advantage does not take effect until 2013 under the act, 3m was required to recognize the full accounting impact in its financial statements in the period in which the act was signed. because future anticipated retiree health care liabilities and related tax subsidies are already reflected in 3ms financial statements, the change in law resulted in a reduction of the value of the companys deferred tax asset related to the subsidy. this reduction in value resulted in a one-time non-cash income tax charge to 3ms earnings in 2010 of approximately $84 million, or 12 cents per diluted share.
the company files income tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign jurisdictions. with few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to u.s. federal, state and local, or non-u.s. income tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2003.
the irs completed its field examination of the companys u.s. federal income tax returns for the years 2005 through 2007 in the fourth quarter of 2009. the company protested certain irs positions within these tax years and entered into the administrative appeals process with the irs during the first quarter of 2010. during the first quarter of 2010, the irs completed its field examination of the companys u.s. federal income tax return for the 2008 year. the

company protested certain irs positions for 2008 and entered into the administrative appeals process with the irs during the second quarter of 2010. during the first quarter of 2011, the irs completed its field examination of the companys u.s. federal income tax return for the 2009 year. the company protested certain irs positions for 2009 and entered into the administrative appeals process with the irs during the second quarter of 2011. currently, the company is under examination by the irs for its u.s. federal income tax returns for the years 2010 and 2011. it is anticipated that the irs will complete its examination of the company for 2010 by the end of the first quarter of 2012, and for 2011 by the end of the first quarter of 2013. as of december31, 2011, the irs has not proposed any significant adjustments to the companys tax positions for which the company is not adequately reserved.
during the first quarter of 2010, the company paid the agreed upon assessments for the 2005 tax year.during the second quarter of 2010, the company paid the agreed upon assessments for the 2008 tax year. during the second quarter of 2011, the company received a refund from the irs for the 2004 tax year. payments relating to other proposed assessments arising from the 2005 through 2011 examinations may not be made until a final agreement is reached between the company and the irs on such assessments or upon a final resolution resulting from the administrative appeals process or judicial action. in addition to the u.s. federal examination, there is also limited audit activity in several u.s. state and foreign jurisdictions.
3m anticipates changes to the companys uncertain tax positions due to the closing of various audit years in the next 12 months that include material unrecognized tax benefits. the company believes that the closing of those years will result in a decrease in the companys uncertain tax positions as a result of both cash payments and adjustments to previously recorded income tax reserves. currently, the company is not able to reasonably estimate the amount by which the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will increase or decrease during the next 12 months as a result of the ongoing income tax authority examinations.

the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits, if recognized, would affect the effective tax rate by $295 million as of december31, 2011, $394 million as of december31, 2010, and $425 million as of december31, 2009. the ending net utb results from adjusting the gross balance for items such as federal, state, and non-u.s. deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes. the net utb is included as components of other current assets, other assets, and other liabilities within the consolidated balance sheet.
the company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax expense. the company recognized in the consolidated statement of income on a gross basis approximately $1 million of benefit, $9 million of benefit, and $6 million of expense in 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. at december31, 2011 and december31, 2010, accrued interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheet on a gross basis were $56 million and $52 million, respectively. included in these interest and penalty amounts are interest and penalties related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. because of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing authority to an earlier period.
as a result of certain employment commitments and capital investments made by 3m, income from manufacturing activities in china, taiwan, korea, brazil, and singapore is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years through 2013, 2016, 2018, 2023, and 2023, respectively. the income tax benefits attributable to

the tax status of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $77 million (11 cents per diluted share) in 2011, $69 million (10 cents per diluted share) in 2010, and $50 million (7 cents per diluted share) in 2009.
the company has not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to international companies that have been considered to be reinvested indefinitely. these earnings relate to ongoing operations and were approximately $7.1 billion as of december31, 2011. because of the availability of u.s. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested.

classification of marketable securities as current or non-current is dependent upon managements intended holding period, the securitys maturity date and liquidity considerations based on market conditions. if management intends to hold the securities for longer than one year as of the balance sheet date, they are classified as non-current. at december31, 2011, gross unrealized losses totaled approximately $12 million (pre-tax), while gross unrealized gains totaled approximately $3 million (pre-tax). at december31, 2010, gross unrealized losses totaled approximately $9 million (pre-tax), while gross unrealized gains totaled approximately $5 million (pre-tax). gross realized gains on sales or maturities of marketable securities were not material in 2011, 2010 and 2009. gross realized losses on sales or maturities of marketable securities were not material in 2011 and 2010, and totaled $3 million in 2009. cost of securities sold use the first in, first out (fifo) method. since these marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, changes in fair value will flow through other comprehensive income, with amounts reclassified out of other comprehensive income into earnings upon sale or other-than-temporary impairment.
table of contents
3m reviews impairments associated with its marketable securities in accordance with the measurement guidance provided by asc 320,investments-debt and equity securities, when determining the classification of the impairment as temporary or other-than-temporary. a temporary impairment charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of shareholders equity. such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income attributable to 3m for the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. the factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future cash flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying collateral, as well as other factors.
the balance at december31, 2011 for marketable securities by contractual maturity are shown below. actual maturities may differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

3m has a diversified marketable securities portfolio of $2.357 billion as of december31, 2011. within this portfolio, current and long-term asset-backed securities (estimated fair value of $1.055 billion) are primarily comprised of interests in automobile loans and credit cards. at december31, 2011, the asset-backed securities credit ratings were aaa or a-1+, with the exception of two securities (one rated aaa/a3 and one rated aaa/a1) with a fair market value of less than $7 million.
3ms marketable securities portfolio includes auction rate securities that represent interests in investment grade credit default swaps; however, currently these holdings comprise less than one percent of this portfolio. the estimated fair value of auction rate securities are $4 million and $7 million as of december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. gross unrealized losses within accumulated other comprehensive income related to auction rate securities totaled $9 million (pre-tax) and $6 million (pre-tax) as of december31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. as of december31, 2011, auction rate securities associated with these balances have been in a loss position for more than 12 months. since the second half of 2007, these auction rate securities failed to auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders. liquidity for these auction-rate securities is typically provided by an auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7, 28, 35, or 90 days. the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible until a successful auction occurs or a buyer is found outside of the auction process. refer to note 13 for a table that reconciles the beginning and ending balances of auction rate securities.

long-term debt payments due in 2012 include $59 million of floating rate notes. the floating rate notes are classified as current portion of long-term debt as the result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments. as a result of put provisions, long-term debt payments due in 2013 include floating rate notes totaling $73 million (included in other borrowings in the long-term debt table), and in 2014 include floating rate notes totaling $97 million.
the floating rate notes contain put provisions granting the holders the option to require 3m to repurchase the securities on certain dates. under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2044, holders have an annual put feature. 3m would be required to repurchase these securities at a discount to par ranging from 98 percent to 99 percent up until 2013, and at 100 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final maturity. under the terms of the floating rate notes due in 2027, 2040, and 2041, holders have put options that commence ten

years after the date of issuance and each third anniversary thereafter until final maturity. 3m would be required to repurchase these securities at various prices, ranging from 99 percent to 100 percent of par value according to the redemption schedules for each security. in 2011, 2010, 2009 and 2008, 3m was required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on the aforementioned floating rate notes.
significant borrowings that were partially or fully repaid in 2011 included the $800 million medium-term note, the final redemption of convertible notes, the remaining portion of the 17.4 billion japanese yen loan, and the remaining portion of the $201 million canadian dollar loan. the primary borrowing in 2011 related to the five-year $1 billion fixed rate note debt issuance in september2011. additional details on the japanese yen loan, canadian loan, convertible notes redemption, and $1 billion debt issuance follow.
during the first quarter of 2010, the company entered into a floating rate note payable of 17.4 billion japanese yen (approximately $188 million based on applicable exchange rates at that time) in connection with the purchase of additional interest in the companys sumitomo 3m limited subsidiary as discussed in note 6. this note was due in three equal installments of 5.8 billion japanese yen, with installments paid on september30, 2010, march30, 2011, and september30, 2011. interest on the note was based on the three-month tokyo interbank offered rate (tibor) plus 40 basis points.
in the fourth quarter of 2010, the company entered into a 100.5 million canadian dollar loan, with four equal installments due in april2011, july2011, october2011 and january2012. during march2011, this loan agreement was amended to increase the loan amount to 201 million canadian dollars and to allow for repayment of the total loan in july2012, instead of in four equal installments. however, 3m had the option to repay the principal amount of this loan before july2012. all other terms and conditions of the loan agreement remained in full force. in the third quarter and fourth quarter of 2011, 3m repaid principal of 50.25 million canadian dollars and 150.75 million canadian dollars, respectively, resulting in this loan being paid in full as of december31, 2011.
in september2011, 3m redeemed all remaining convertible notes, which were otherwise due in 2032. as a result, in september2011, 3m paid out cash of approximately $227 million (with no gain or loss on extinguishment). of this amount, $24 million was classified as cash flow for operating activities (for accretion/accreted interest on debt), with the remainder classified as cash flows from financing activities (repayment of debt). as background, 3m sold $639 million in aggregate face amount of 30-year zero-coupon senior notes (convertible notes) on november15, 2002, which were convertible into shares of 3m common stock. the gross proceeds from the offering were $550 million ($540 million net of issuance costs). the face amount at maturity was subsequently reduced by investor put exercises that occurred in november2005 and 2007. if the conditions for conversion were met, 3m could have chosen to pay in cash and/or common stock; however, if this occurred, the company had the intent and ability to settle this debt security in cash. accordingly, there was no impact on diluted earnings per share attributable to 3m common shareholders.
the company has a well-known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement, effective august5, 2011, which registers an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. the company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes. this replaced 3ms previous shelf registration dated february17, 2009. in september2011, in connection with the august5, 2011 well-known seasoned issuer registration statement, 3m established a $3 billion medium-term notes program (seriesf), from which 3m issued a five-year $1 billion fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 1.375%. proceeds were used for general corporate purposes, including repayment in november2011 of $800 million (principal amount) of medium-term notes.
in connection with a prior well-known seasoned issuer shelf registration, in june2007 the company established a $3 billion medium-term notes program. three debt securities were issued under this medium-term notes program. first, in december2007, 3m issued a five-year, $500 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.65%. second, in august2008, 3m issued a five-year, $850 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.375%. third, in october2008, the company issued a three-year $800 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.50%. the company entered into interest rate swaps to convert this $800 million note to a floating rate. this three-year fixed rate note and related interest rate swaps matured in the fourth quarter of 2011.
the company also issued notes under a $1.5 billion medium-term note program established in december2003. in march2007, the company issued a 30-year, $750 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 5.70%. in november2006, 3m issued a three-year, $400 million, fixed rate note. the company entered into an interest rate swap to convert this to a rate based on a floating libor index. both the note and related swap matured in november2009. in december2004, 3m issued a 40-year, $60 million floating rate note, with the rate based on a
table of contents
floating libor index. this $1.5 billion medium term note program was replaced by the $3 billion program established in june2007.
in july2007, 3m issued a seven-year 5.0% fixed rate eurobond for an amount of 750 million euros (book value of approximately $1.006 billion in u.s. dollars at december31, 2011). in addition, in december2007, 3m reopened its existing seven year 5.0% fixed rate eurobond for an additional amount of 275 million euros (book value of approximately $358 million in u.s. dollars at december31, 2011). this security was issued at a premium and was subsequently consolidated with the original security in january2008. upon the initial debt issuance in july2007, 3m completed a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on a notional amount of 400 million euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate eurobond obligation. in august2010, the company terminated 150 million euros of the notional amount of this swap. as a result, the notional amount remaining after the partial termination is 250 million euros. the termination of a portion of this swap did not impact the terms of the remaining portion. after these swaps, the fixed rate portion of the eurobond totaled 775 million euros and the floating rate portion totaled 250 million euros.
the company has an aa- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from standard& poors and an aa2 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from moodys investors service. in august2011, 3m entered into a $1.5 billion, five-year multi-currency revolving credit agreement, which replaced the existing agreement that was due to expire in april2012. this credit agreement includes a provision under which 3m may request an increase of up to $500 million, bringing the total facility up to $2 billion (at the lenders discretion). this facility was undrawn at december31, 2011. also, in august2011, 3m entered into a $200 million, one-year committed line/letter of credit agreement with hsbc bank usa. this agreement replaced the sublimit for letters of credit that was previously encompassed in the $1.5 billion five-year facility. as of december31, 2011, available committed credit facilities, including the preceding $1.5 billion five-year credit facility and $200 million facility, totaled approximately $1.785 billion worldwide. the amount utilized against these credit facilities totaled $147 million as of december31, 2011. this included $121 million in letters of credit issued under the $200 million facility, $18 million in international lines of credit and $8 million in u.s. lines of credit outstanding with other banking partners. an additional approximately $100 million in stand-alone letters of credit was also issued and outstanding at december31, 2011. these lines/letters of credit are utilized in connection with normal business activities. under both the $1.5 billion and $200 million credit agreements, the company is required to maintain its ebitda to interest ratio as of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. this is calculated (as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total ebitda for the four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same period. at december31, 2011, this ratio was approximately 40 to 1. debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.

note 11. pension and postretirement benefit plans
3m has company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all u.s. employees and many employees outside the united states. in total, 3m has over 65 plans in 25 countries. pension benefits associated with these plans generally are based on each participants years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. the u.s. defined-benefit pension plan was closed to new participants effective january1, 2009. the company also provides certain postretirement health care and life insurance benefits for substantially all of its u.s. employees who reach retirement age while employed by the company. most international employees and retirees are covered by government health care programs. the cost of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international employees is not material and is combined with u.s. amounts in the tables that follow.
the companys pension funding policy is to deposit with independent trustees amounts allowable by law. trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their beneficiaries. there are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its nature. for its u.s. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit plans, the company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit payments with an independent trustee.
in august2006, the pension protection act (ppa) was signed into law in the u.s. the ppa transition rulesincreased the funding target for defined benefit pension plans to 100% of the target liability by 2011. 3ms u.s. qualified defined benefit plan does not have a mandatory cash contribution because the company has a significant credit balance from previous discretionary contributions that can be applied to any ppa funding requirements.
in 2008, the company made modifications to its u.s. postretirement benefits plan. the changes were effective beginning january1, 2009, and allow current retired employees and employees who retire before january1, 2013 the option to continue on the existing postretirement plans or elect the new plans. current employees who retire after december31, 2012, will receive a savings account benefits-based plan. in 2009, the company made further modifications to its u.s. postretirement benefit plan. the changes were effective beginning january1, 2010, and limit the amount of medical inflation absorbed by the company to three percent a year. as a result, as of the december31, 2009 measurement date, the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (apbo) was reduced by $168 million.
in the fourth quarter of 2010, the company made further changes to its u.s. postretirement benefit plans. as a result of these changes, the company will transition all current and future retirees to the savings account benefits-based plan announced in 2008. these changes become effective beginning january1, 2013, for all medicare eligible retirees and their medicare eligible dependents and january1, 2015, for all non-medicare eligible retirees and their eligible dependents. as a result, as of the december31, 2010 measurement date, the apbo increased by $69 million.
in the second quarter 2010, 3ms brazilian subsidiary received approval from the government in brazil to freeze its defined benefit pension plan. effective march31, 2010, participants in this subsidiarys pension plan no longer accrue additional pension benefits. as a result, the company recorded a $22 million curtailment gain in the second quarter of 2010.
during the second quarter of 2009, the company offered a voluntary early retirement incentive program to certain eligible participants of its u.s. pension plans who met age and years of pension service requirements. the eligible participants who accepted the offer and retired by june1, 2009, received an enhanced pension benefit. pension benefits were enhanced by adding one additional year of pension service and one additional year of age for certain benefit calculations. approximately 700 participants accepted the offer and retired by june1, 2009. as a result, the company incurred a $21 million charge related to these special termination benefits.
during 2009, 3m sumitomo (japan) experienced a higher number of retirements than normal, largely due to early retirement incentive programs, which required eligible employees who elected to leave the company to retire by september2009. participants in the japan pension plan had the option of receiving cash lump sum payments when exiting the plan, which a number of participants exiting the pension plan elected to receive. in accordance with asc 715, compensation  retirement benefits, settlement accounting is required when the lump sum distributions in a year are greater than the sum of the annual service and interest costs. due to the large number of lump sum payment elections in 2009, the company incurred $17 million of settlement charges.
3m was informed during the first quarter of 2009 that the general partners of wg trading company, in which 3ms benefit plans hold limited partnership interests, are the subject of a criminal investigation as well as civil proceedings by the sec and cftc (commodity futures trading commission). in march2011, over the objections of 3m and six
table of contents
other limited partners of wg trading company, the district court judge ruled in favor of the court appointed receivers proposed distribution plan. in april2011, the 3m benefit plans received their share under the court-ordered distribution plan. 3m and six other limited partners of wg trading company have appealed the courts order to the united states court of appeals for the second circuit. the benefit plan trustee holdings of wg trading company interests were adjusted to reflect the decreased estimated fair market value, inclusive of estimated insurance proceeds, as of the annual measurement dates. the company has insurance that it believes, based on what is currently known, will result in the recovery of a portion of the decrease in original asset value. as of the 2011 measurement date these holdings represented less than one percent of 3ms fair value of total plan assets. 3m currently believes that the resolution of these events will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company.
in december2011, the company began offering a voluntary early retirement incentive program to certain eligible participants of its u.s. pension plans who meet age and years of pension service requirements. the eligible participants who accept the offer and retire on february1, 2012, receive an enhanced pension benefit. pension benefits are enhanced by adding one additional year of pension service and one additional year of age for certain benefit calculations. subsequent to year-end, 616 participants accepted the offer and retired on february1, 2012. as a result, the company will incur a $26 million charge related to these special termination benefits in the first quarter of 2012.

as noted above, effective january1, 2010, the company made modifications to its postretirement health plan to limit the amount of inflation it will cover to three percent per year; the remaining inflation will be passed on to plan participants. also, in 2010 the company announced that it will transition all current and future retirees to the savings account benefits-based plan announced in 2008. therefore, the company no longer has material exposure to health care cost inflation.

the company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december31 measurement date for the pension and postretirement benefit plans, which is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. the company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. using this methodology, the company determined a discount rate of 4.15% for pension and 4.04% for postretirement benefits to be appropriate for its u.s. plans as of december31, 2011, which is a decrease of 1.08 percentage points and 1.05 percentage points, respectively, from the rates used as of december31, 2010. for the international pension and postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. if the country has a deep market in corporate bonds the company matches the expected cash flows from the plan either to a portfolio of bonds that generate sufficient cash flow or a notional yield curve generated from available bond information. in countries that do not have a deep market in corporate bonds, government bonds are considered with a risk premium to approximate corporate bond yields.
for the u.s. qualified pension plans, the companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 8.50% in 2011. the company is lowering the 2012 expected return on plan assets for its u.s. pension plan by 0.25 percentage points to 8.25%. this will increase the 2012 expected pension expense by approximately $30 million. projected returns are based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. as of december31, 2011, the companys 2012 expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 37% global equities, with an expected long-term rate of return of 7.75%; 16% private equities, with an expected long-term rate of return of 11.75%; 26% fixed-income securities, with an expected long-term rate of return of 4.23%; 16% absolute return investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, with an expected long term return of 6.0%; and 5% commodities, with an expected long-term rate of return of 6.0%. the company expects additional positive return from active investment management. these assumptions result in an 8.25% expected rate of return on an annualized basis in 2012. the actual rate of return on plan assets in 2011 was 8.7%. in 2010 the plan earned a rate of return of 14.4% and in 2009 earned a return of 12.6%. the average annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been 8.1% and 10.4%, respectively. return on assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of return assumptions.
during 2011, the company contributed $517 million to its u.s. and international pension plans and $65 million to its postretirement plans. during 2010, the company contributed $556 million to its u.s. and international pension plans and $62 million to its postretirement plans. in 2012, the company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $800 million to $1 billion of cash to its u.s. and international retirement plans. the company does not have a

required minimum cash pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2012. therefore, the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly depending on the u.s. plans funded status and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution. future contributions will also depend on market conditions, interest rates and other factors.

3ms investment strategy for its pension and postretirement plans is to manage the funds on a going-concern basis. the primary goal of the funds is to meet the obligations as required. the secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without subjecting the company to an undue amount of contribution rate volatility. fund returns are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits, thus reducing the level of contributions 3m must make. the investment strategy has used long duration cash and derivative instruments to offset a significant portion of the interest rate sensitivity of u.s. pension liabilities. in addition, credit risk is managed through mandates for public securities and maximum issuer limits that are established and monitored on a regular basis.
during 2009, $600 million of 3m common stock was contributed to the principal u.s. qualified pension plan. all of the 3m shares contributed to the u.s. pension plan were sold before 2009 year end by an independent fiduciary to the plan. normally, 3m does not buy or sell any of its own stock as a direct investment for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds. however, due to external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold 3m stock. the aggregate amount of the shares would not be considered to be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.
the discussion that follows references the fair value measurements of certain assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. see note 13 for descriptions of these levels. while the company believes the valuation methods are appropriate and consistent with other market participants, the use of different methodologies or assumptions to determine the fair value of certain financial instruments could result in a different estimate of fair value at the reporting date.

u.s. pension plans assets
in order to achieve the investment objectives in the u.s. pension plans, the investment policy includes a target strategic asset allocation. the investment policy allows some tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and illiquidity of some investments may cause the allocation to a specific asset class to stray from the target allocation, potentially for long periods of time. acceptable ranges have been designed to allow for deviation from long-term targets and to allow for the opportunity for tactical over- and under-weights. the portfolio will normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end asset allocation deviates from acceptable ranges. the allocation is reviewed regularly by the named fiduciary of the plans.

publicly traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual securities are traded. index funds are valued at the net asset value (nav) as determined by the custodian of the fund. the nav is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding. long/short equity interests are valued using the most recent general partner statement of fair value, updated for any subsequent partnership interests cash flows or expected changes in fair value.
fixed income includes derivative instruments such as credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and futures contracts that are used to help manage risks. u.s. government and government agency bonds and notes are valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the individual security is traded. corporate bonds and notes, asset backed securities and collateralized mortgage obligations are valued at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flows approach that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be observable such as credit and liquidity risks. private placement funds are valued using the most recent general partner statement of fair value, updated for any subsequent partnership interests cash flows or expected changes in fair value. swaps and derivative instruments are valued by the custodian using closing market swap curves and market derived inputs.
the private equity portfolio is a diversified mix of partnership interests including buyouts, distressed debt, growth equity, mezzanine, real estate and venture capital investments. partnership interests are valued using the most recent general partner statement of fair value, updated for any subsequent partnership interests cash flows or expected changes in fair value.
absolute return consists primarily of private partnership interests in hedge funds, hedge fund of funds and bank loan funds. partnership interests are valued using the nav as determined by the administrator or custodian of the fund. hedge fund partnership interests, which have a redemption right and are past any lock-up redemption period, are classified as level 2.
commodities consist of commodity-linked notes and commodity-linked derivative contracts designed to deliver investment returns similar to the goldman sachs commodities index (gsci) or dow jones ubs commodity index returns. commodities are valued at closing prices determined by calculation agents for outstanding transactions.

international pension plans assets
outside the u.s., pension plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. the disclosure below of asset categories is presented in aggregate for over 65 plans in 24 countries; however, there is significant variation in policy asset allocation from country to country. local regulations, local funding rules, and local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment allocation process in each country. 3ms treasury group provides standard funding and investment guidance to all international plans with more focused guidance to the larger plans.
each plan has its own strategic asset allocation. the asset allocations are reviewed periodically and rebalanced when necessary.

note 12. derivatives
the company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. the information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial instruments used by 3m, how and why 3m uses such instruments, how such instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3ms financial position and performance.
additional information with respect to the impacts on other comprehensive income of nonderivative hedging and derivative instruments is included in note 6. additional information with respect to the fair value of derivative instruments is included in note 13. references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments associated with the companys long-term debt are also made in note 10.
types of derivatives/hedging instruments and inclusion in income/other comprehensive income
cash flow hedges:
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. gains and losses on the derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current earnings.
cash flow hedging - foreign currency forward and option contracts: the company enters into foreign exchange forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. these transactions are designated as cash flow hedges. the settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. generally, 3m dedesignates these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence of the forecasted transaction. the portion of gains or losses on the derivative instrument previously accumulated in other comprehensive income for dedesignated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the forecasted transaction occurs. changes in the value of derivative instruments after dedesignation are recorded in earnings and are included in the derivatives not designated as hedging instruments section below. hedge ineffectiveness and the amount excluded from effectiveness testing recognized in income on cash flow hedges were not material for 2011, 2010 and 2009. the maximum length of time over which 3m hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for a majority of the forecasted transactions is 12 months and, accordingly, at december31, 2011, the majority of the companys open foreign exchange forward and option contracts had maturities of one year or less. the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the companys foreign exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges at december31, 2011 was approximately $4.5 billion.
cash flow hedging - commodity price management: the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical contracts. the company uses commodity price swaps relative to natural gas as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions to manage price volatility. the related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges is included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. generally, the length of time over which 3m hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for its forecasted natural gas transactions is 12 months. no significant commodity cash flow hedges were discontinued and hedge ineffectiveness was not material for 2011, 2010 and 2009. the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the companys natural gas commodity price swaps designated as cash flow hedges at december31, 2011 was $29 million.
cash flow hedging  forecasted debt issuance: in august2011, in anticipation of the september2011 issuance of $1 billion in five-year fixed rate notes, 3m executed a pre-issuance cash flow hedge on a notional amount of $400 million by entering into a forward-starting five-year floating-to-fixed interest rate swap. upon debt issuance in september2011, 3m terminated the floating-to-fixed interest rate swap. the termination of the swap resulted in a $7 million pre-tax loss ($4 million after-tax) that will be amortized over the five-year life of the note and, when material, is included in the tables below as part of the loss recognized in income on the effective portion of derivatives as a result of reclassification from accumulated other comprehensive income.
table of contents
as of december31, 2011, the company had a balance of $22 million associated with the after tax net unrealized gain associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income. this includes a $4 million balance (loss) related to a floating-to-fixed interest rate swap (discussed in the preceding paragraph), which will be amortized over the five-year life of the note. 3m expects to reclassify a majority of the remaining balance to earnings over the next 12 months (with the impact offset by cash flows from underlying hedged items).
the location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges are provided in the following table. reclassifications of amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income into income include accumulated gains (losses) on dedesignated hedges at the time earnings are impacted by the forecasted transaction.

fair value hedges:
for derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings.
fair value hedging - interest rate swaps: the company manages interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. to help manage borrowing costs, the company may enter into interest rate swaps. under these arrangements, the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount. the mark-to-market of these fair value hedges is recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss of the underlying debt instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense. these fair value hedges are highly effective and, thus, there is no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness. the dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency exchange rates) gross notional amount of the companys interest rate swaps at december31, 2011 was $342 million.

at december31, 2011, the company had interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of underlying fixed rate obligations. in july2007, in connection with the issuance of a seven-year eurobond for an amount of 750 million euros, the company completed a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on a notional amount of 400 million euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate eurobond obligation. in august2010, the company terminated 150 million euros of the notional amount of this swap. as a result, a gain of 18 million euros, recorded as part of the balance of the underlying debt, will be amortized as an offset to interest expense over this debts remaining life. prior to termination of the applicable portion of the interest rate swap, the mark-to-market of the hedge instrument was recorded as gains or losses in interest expense and was offset by the gain or loss on carrying value of the underlying debt instrument. consequently, the subsequent amortization of the 18 million euros recorded as part of the underlying debt balance is not part of gains on hedged items recognized in income in the tables below.
in november2006, the company entered into a $400 million fixed-to-floating interest rate swap concurrent with the issuance of the three-year medium-term note due in 2009. the swap and underlying note matured in november2009.
the company also had two fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $800 million designated as fair value hedges of the fixed interest rate obligation under the $800 million, three-year, 4.50% notes issued in october2008. these swaps and underlying note matured in the fourth quarter of 2011.
fair value hedging  foreign currency: in november2008, the company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to purchase japanese yen, pound sterling, and euros with a notional amount of $255 million at the contract rates. these contracts were designated as fair value hedges of a u.s. dollar tax obligation. these fair value hedges matured in early january2009. the mark-to-market of these forward contracts was recorded as gains or losses in tax expense and was offset by the gain or loss on the underlying tax obligation, which also was recorded in tax expense. changes in the value of these contracts in 2009 through their maturity were not material.

net investment hedges:
as circumstances warrant, the company uses cross currency swaps, forwards and foreign currency denominated debt to hedge portions of the companys net investments in foreign operations. for hedges that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in cumulative translation within other comprehensive income. the remainder of the change in value of such instruments is recorded in earnings. recognition in earnings of amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation is limited to circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net investment in the hedged foreign operation. at december31, 2011, there were no cross currency swaps and foreign currency forward contracts designated as net investment hedges.
in november2006, the company entered into a three-year floating-to-floating cross currency swap with a notional amount of $200 million. this transaction was a partial hedge of the companys net investment in its european subsidiaries. this swap converted u.s. dollar-based variable interest payments to euro-based variable interest payments associated with the notional amount. this swap matured in november2009.

in september2006, the company entered into a three-year floating-to-floating cross currency swap with a notional amount of $300 million. this transaction was a partial hedge of the companys net investment in its japanese subsidiaries. this swap converted u.s. dollar-based variable interest payments to yen-based variable interest payments associated with the notional amount. this swap matured in september2009.
3m uses foreign currency denominated debt as nonderivative hedging instruments in certain net investment hedges. in julyand december2007, the company issued seven-year fixed rate eurobond securities for amounts of 750 million euros and 275 million euros, respectively. 3m designated each of these eurobond issuances as hedging instruments of the companys net investment in its european subsidiaries.
the location in the consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative and nonderivative instruments designated as net investment hedges are as follows. there were no reclassifications of the effective portion of net investment hedges out of accumulated other comprehensive income into income for the periods presented in the table below.

derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include dedesignated foreign currency forward and option contracts that formerly were designated in cash flow hedging relationships (as referenced in the cash flow hedges section above). in addition, 3m enters into foreign currency forward contracts and commodity price swaps to offset, in part, the impacts of certain intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing arrangements) and fluctuations in costs associated with the use of certain precious metals, respectively. these derivative instruments are not designated in hedging relationships; therefore, fair value gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in earnings. the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of these forward, option and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments totaled $1.1 billion as of december31, 2011. the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.

currency effects
currency effects: 3m estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts, increased net income attributable to 3m by approximately $154 million in 2011 and increased net income attributable to 3m by approximately $15 million in 2010. this estimate includes the effect of translating profits from local currencies into u.s. dollars; the impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united states and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the negative impact of swapping venezuelan bolivars into u.s. dollars. 3m estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses had an immaterial impact on net income attributable to 3m in 2011 and decreased net income attributable to 3m by approximately $115 million in 2010.
table of contents
note 13. fair value measurements
3m follows asc 820, fair value measurements and disclosures, with respect to assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and nonrecurring basis. under the standard, fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants as of the measurement date. the standard also establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. observable inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of the company. unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the companys assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the circumstances. the hierarchy is broken down into three levels. level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly. level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability. categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
for 3m, assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis primarily relate to available-for-sale marketable securities, available-for-sale investments (included as part of investments in the consolidated balance sheet) and certain derivative instruments. derivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and most net investment hedges. the information in the following paragraphs and tables primarily addresses matters relative to these financial assets and liabilities. separately, there were no material fair value measurements with respect to nonfinancial assets or liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the companys financial statements on a recurring basis for 2011 and 2010.
3m uses various valuation techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches, with respect to financial assets and liabilities. following is a description of the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and liabilities measured at fair value.
available-for-sale marketable securities  except auction rate securities:
marketable securities, except auction rate securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. a weighted average price is used for these securities. market prices are obtained for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers, security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party sources. these multiple prices are used as inputs into a distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be used. 3m classifies u.s. treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable securities (excluding auction rate securities) are classified as level 2. marketable securities are discussed further in note 9.
available-for-sale marketable securities  auction rate securities only:
as discussed in note 9, auction rate securities held by 3m failed to auction since the second half of 2007. as a result, investments in auction rate securities are valued utilizing third-party indicative bid levels in markets that are not active and broker-dealer valuation models that utilize inputs such as current/forward interest rates, current market conditions and credit default swap spreads. 3m classifies these securities as level 3.
available-for-sale investments:
investments include equity securities that are traded in an active market. closing stock prices are readily available from active markets and are used as being representative of fair value. 3m classifies these securities as level 1.
derivative instruments:
the companys derivative assets and liabilities within the scope of asc 815, derivatives and hedging, are required to be recorded at fair value. the companys derivatives that are recorded at fair value include foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity price swaps, interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is recorded at fair value. net investment hedges that use foreign currency denominated debt to hedge 3ms net investment are not impacted by the fair value measurement standard under asc 820, as the debt
table of contents
used as the hedging instrument is marked to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign currency exchange rates and not with respect to other factors that may impact fair value.
3m has determined that foreign currency forwards and commodity price swaps will be considered level 1 measurements as these are traded in active markets which have identical asset or liabilities, while currency swaps, foreign currency options, interest rate swaps and cross-currency swaps will be considered level 2. for level 2 derivatives, 3m uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset. these inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities, and interest rates. the level 2 derivative positions are primarily valued using standard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable market parameters. industry standard data providers are 3ms primary source for forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates, with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party or counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.

in addition, the plan assets of 3ms pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured at fair value on a recurring basis (at least annually). refer to note 11.
assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:
disclosures are required for certain assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value, but are recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis in periods subsequent to initial recognition. for 3m, such measurements of fair value relate primarily to long-lived asset impairments.
the following table provides information by level for assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis. this table provides the fair value and amount of long-lived asset impairments for the periods indicated. refer to note 1 (property, plant and equipment and intangible assets) for further discussion of accounting policies related to long-lived asset impairments.
table of contents
there were no material long-lived asset impairments for 2011 and 2010. long-lived asset impairments for 2009 included the portion of 2009 restructuring actions related to long-lived asset impairments as discussed in note 4, with the complete carrying amount of such assets written off and included in operating income results. in addition to the restructuring activities, in june2009 the company recorded a $13 million impairment of certain long-lived assets associated with the uk passport production activity of 3ms security systems division (within the safety, security and protection services business segment). in june2009, 3m was notified that the uk government decided to award the production of its passports to a competitor upon the expiration of 3ms existing uk passport contracts in october2010. accordingly, 3m tested the long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity for recoverability which indicated that the asset groupings carrying amount exceeded the remaining expected cash flows. as a result, associated assets were written down to a fair value of $41 million in june2009. 3m primarily uses a discounted cash flow model that uses inputs such as interest rates and cost of capital, to determine the fair value of such assets. 3m considers these level 3 inputs.

fair value of financial instruments:
the companys financial instruments include cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, certain investments, accounts payable, borrowings, and derivative contracts. the fair values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt approximated carrying values because of the short-term nature of these instruments. available-for-sale marketable securities and investments, in addition to certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair values as indicated in the preceding disclosures. the company utilized third-party quotes to estimate fair values for its long-term debt. information with respect to the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of these financial instruments follow:

the fair values reflected above consider the terms of the related debt absent the impacts of derivative/hedging activity. the carrying amount of long-term debt referenced above is impacted by certain fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedges and by the designation of fixed rate eurobond securities issued by the company as hedging instruments of the companys net investment in its european subsidiaries. 3ms fixed-rate bonds were trading at a premium at december31, 2011 and 2010 due to the low interest rates and tightening of 3ms credit spreads.

note 14. commitments and contingencies
capital and operating leases:
rental expense under operating leases was $279 million in 2011, $262 million in 2010 and $244 million in 2009. it is 3ms practice to secure renewal rights for leases, thereby giving 3m the right, but not the obligation, to maintain a presence in a leased facility. 3m has two primary capital leases. first, 3m has a capital lease, which became effective in april2003, that involves a building in the united kingdom (with a lease term of 22 years). during the second quarter of 2003, 3m recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately 33.5 million united kingdom pounds (approximately $52 million at december31, 2011 exchange rates). second, during the fourth quarter of 2009, 3m recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of approximately $50 million related to an it investment with an amortization period of seven years.
minimum lease payments under capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms in excess of one year as of december31, 2011, were as follows:

3ms accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are estimated at approximately $28 million as of december31, 2011 and approximately $27 million as of december31, 2010. 3m does not consider this amount to be material. the fair value of 3m guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not material.
related party activity:
3m does not have any material related party activity that is not in the ordinary course of business.
legal proceedings:
the company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits, principally in the united states, and regulatory proceedings worldwide. these include various products liability (involving products that the company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property, and commercial claims and lawsuits, including those brought under the antitrust laws, and environmental proceedings. unless otherwise stated, the company is vigorously defending all such litigation.
process for disclosure and recording of liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings
many lawsuits and claims involve highly complex issues relating to causation, scientific evidence, and whether there are actual damages and are otherwise subject to substantial uncertainties. assessments of lawsuits and claims can involve a series of complex judgments about future events and can rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. the company complies with the requirements of asc topic 450, contingencies, and related guidance, and records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability is probable. where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the company records the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if there is no one best estimate. the company either discloses the amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established reserves if estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. the company discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable
table of contents
or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the company believes there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.
the company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of the claim, and records an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered. for those insured matters where the company has taken a reserve, the company also records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the companys insurance program. for those insured matters where the company has not taken a reserve because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, but where the company has incurred an expense in defending itself, the company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred.
because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. a future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded. the company currently believes that such future charges, if any, would not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company, taking into account its significant available insurance coverage. based on experience and developments, the company reexamines its estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables each period, and whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not probable. where appropriate, the company makes additions to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. as a result, the current estimates of the potential impact on the companys consolidated financial position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the company could change in the future.
the following table shows the major categories of significant legal matters  respirator mask/asbestos litigation (including aearo), environmental remediation and other environmental liabilities  for which the company has been able to estimate its probable liability and for which the company has taken reserves and the related insurance receivables:
atdecember31 (millions)
respirator mask/asbestos liabilities

the following sections first describe the significant legal proceedings in which the company is involved, and then describe the liabilities and associated insurance receivables the company has accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings.
respirator mask/asbestos litigation
as of december31, 2011, the company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 2,260 individual claimants compared to approximately 2,148 individual claimants with actions pending at december31, 2010.
the vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the company allege use of some of the companys mask and respirator products and seek damages from the company and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace. a minority of claimants generally allege personal injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously manufactured by the company, which are often unspecified, as well as products manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at company premises.
the companys current volume of new and pending matters is substantially lower than its historical experience. the company expects that filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in the future will continue to be at much lower levels than in the past. accordingly, the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including mesothelioma and other malignancies, will represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. the company has prevailed in all nine cases taken to trial, including seven of the eight cases tried to verdict (such trials occurred in 1999, 2000, 2001,
table of contents
2003, 2004, and 2007), and an appellate reversal in 2005 of the 2001 jury verdict adverse to the company. the ninth case, tried in 2009, was dismissed by the court at the close of plaintiffs evidence, based on the courts legal finding that the plaintiff had not presented sufficient evidence to support a jury verdict. this case is being appealed by the plaintiffs and briefing is complete and the parties are waiting for the court to set a hearing date for oral argument.
the company has demonstrated in these past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. consequently the company believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are attributable to the companys respiratory protection products. nonetheless the companys litigation experience indicates that claims of persons with malignant conditions are costlier to resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a per-claim basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of claims were asserted by the unimpaired.
plaintiffs have asserted specific dollar claims for damages in approximately 39% of the 1,053 lawsuits that were pending against the company at the end of 2011 in all jurisdictions. a majority of states restrict or prohibit specifying damages in tort cases such as these, and most of the remaining jurisdictions do not require such specification. in those cases in which plaintiffs choose to assert specific dollar amounts in their complaints, brought in states that permit such pleading, the amounts claimed are typically not meaningful as an indicator of the companys potential liability. this is because (a)the amounts claimed typically bear no relation to the extent of the plaintiffs injury, if any; (b)the complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants with the typical complaint asserting claims against as few as a dozen different defendants to upwards of 100 different defendants, the damages alleged are not attributed to individual defendants, and a defendants share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, and by the amount of fault a jury allocates to each defendant if a case is ultimately tried before a jury; (c)many cases are filed against the company even though the plaintiffs did not use any of the companys products and, ultimately, are withdrawn or dismissed without any payment; and (d)many cases are brought on behalf of plaintiffs who have not suffered any medical injury, and, ultimately, are resolved without any payment or a payment that is a small fraction of the damages initially claimed. of the 410 pending cases in which purported damage amounts are specified in the complaints, 250 cases involve claims of $100,000 or less, (three (3)of which also allege punitive damages of $15,000, 15 of which also allege punitive damages of $10 million, and three (3)of which also allege punitive damages of $20 million); 102 cases involve claims between $100,000 and $3 million (46 of which also allege punitive damages of $250,000, and 49 of which also allege punitive damages of $2 million); seven (7)cases involve claims between $3 million and $7.5 million (all of which also allege punitive damages of $5 million); three (3)cases involve claims of $10 million (two (2)of which also allege punitive damages of $10 million); 12 cases involve claims of $50 million (all of which also allege punitive damages of $50 million); and 36 cases involve claims of $100 million (35 of which also allege punitive damages of $100 million, and one (1)of which also alleges punitive damages of $300 million). some complaints allege that the compensatory and punitive damages are at least the amounts specified. as previously stated, the companys experience and the other reasons cited indicate that the damage amounts specified in complaints are not a meaningful factor in any assessment of the companys potential liability.
as previously reported, the state of west virginia, through its attorney general, filed a complaint in 2003 against the company and two other manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the circuit court of lincoln county, west virginia and amended its complaint in 2005. the amended complaint seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the state for workers compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages. while the case has been inactive since the fourth quarter of 2007, the court held a case management conference in march2011, but no further activity has occurred in the case since that conference. no liability has been recorded for this matter because the company believes that liability is not probable and estimable at this time. in addition, the company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss given the minimal activity in this case and the fact that the complaint asserts claims against two other manufacturers where a defendants share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability and by the amount of fault a jury allocates to each defendant if a case is ultimately tried.
respirator mask/asbestos liabilities and insurance receivables: the company estimates its respirator mask/asbestos liabilities, including the cost to resolve the claims and defense costs, by examining: (i)the companys experience in resolving claims, (ii) apparent trends, (iii)the apparent quality of claims (e.g., whether the claim has been asserted on behalf of asymptomatic claimants), (iv) changes in the nature and mix of claims (e.g., the proportion of claims asserting usage of the companys mask or respirator products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by the company), (v)the number of current claims and a projection of the number of future asbestos and other claims that may be filed against the company, (vi)the cost to resolve recently settled claims, and (vii) an estimate of the cost to resolve and defend against current and future claims.
table of contents
developments may occur that could affect the companys estimate of its liabilities. these developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes in (i)the number of future claims, (ii)the average cost of resolving claims, (iii)the legal costs of defending these claims and in maintaining trial readiness, (iv)changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v)trial and appellate outcomes, (vi)changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, and (vii)the financial viability of other co-defendants and insurers.
as a result of the increased costs of aggressively defending itself and the greater cost of resolving claims of persons with malignant conditions, the company increased its reserves in 2011 for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $39 million. as of december31, 2011, the company had reserves for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities of $100 million (excluding aearo reserves). the company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the reserve the company has established because of the (i)inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, particularly with respect to the companys respiratory products that themselves did not contain any harmful materials, (ii)the complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants where the damages alleged are typically not attributed to individual defendants so that a defendants share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, (iii)the multiple factors described above that the company considers in estimating its liabilities, and (iv)the several possible developments described above that may occur that could affect the companys estimate of liabilities.
as of december31, 2011, the companys receivable for insurance recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $121 million. the company increased its receivables for insurance recoveries by $8 million in 2011 related to this litigation. as a result of settlements reached with its insurers, the company was paid approximately $9 million in 2011 in connection with the respirator mask/asbestos litigation.
various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of this receivable, including (i)delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii)the extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future, and (iii)the outcome of negotiations with insurers and legal proceedings with respect to respirator mask/asbestos liability insurance coverage. the difference between the accrued liability and insurance receivable represents in part the time delay between payment of claims on the one hand and receipt of insurance reimbursements on the other hand. because of the lag time between settlement and payment of a claim, no meaningful conclusions may be drawn from quarterly or annual changes in the amount of receivables for expected insurance recoveries or changes in the number of claimants.
as previously reported, on january5, 2007 the company was served with a declaratory judgment action filed on behalf of two of its insurers (continental casualty and continental insurance co.  both part of the continental casualty group) disclaiming coverage for respirator mask/asbestos claims. these insurers represent approximately $14 million of the $121 million insurance recovery receivable referenced in the above table. the action, pending in the district court in ramsey county, minnesota, seeks declaratory judgment regarding coverage provided by the policies and the allocation of covered costs among the policies issued by the various insurers. the action named, in addition to the company, over 60 of the companys insurers. this action is similar in nature to an action filed in 1994 with respect to breast implant coverage, which ultimately resulted in the minnesota supreme courts ruling of 2003 that was largely in the companys favor. the plaintiff insurers have served an amended complaint that names some additional insurers and deletes others. a significant number of the insurer defendants named in the amended complaint have been dismissed because of settlements they have reached with 3m regarding the matters at issue in the lawsuit. the case is currently in the discovery phase. trial is scheduled to begin in the fall of 2012.
respirator mask/asbestos litigation  aearo technologies
on april1, 2008, a subsidiary of the company purchased the stock of aearo holding corp., the parent of aearo technologies (aearo). aearo manufactures and sells various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear, head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection products.
as of december31, 2011, aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated aearos respirator business (american optical corporation, warner-lambert llc, ao corp. and cabot corporation (cabot)) are named defendants, with multiple co-defendants, including the company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages from aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica-related, or other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace.
as of december31, 2011, the company, through its aearo subsidiary, has recorded $30 million as the best estimate of the probable liabilities for product liabilities and defense costs related to current and future aearo-related asbestos and silica-related claims. responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is currently shared in an informal arrangement among aearo, cabot, american optical corporation and a subsidiary of warner lambert and their insurers (the payor group). liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years each company sold respiratory products under the ao safety brand and/or owned the ao safety division of american
table of contents
optical corporation and the alleged years of exposure of the individual plaintiff. aearos share of the contingent liability is further limited by an agreement entered into between aearo and cabot on july11, 1995. this agreement provides that, so long as aearo pays to cabot an annual fee of $400,000, cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and indemnify aearo against, asbestos and silica-related product liability claims for respirators manufactured prior to july11, 1995. because the date of manufacture for a particular respirator allegedly used in the past is often difficult to determine, aearo and cabot have applied the agreement to claims arising out of the alleged use of respirators while exposed to asbestos or silica or products containing asbestos or silica prior to january1, 1997. with these arrangements in place, aearos potential liability is limited to exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators while exposed to asbestos, silica or other occupational dusts on or after january1, 1997.
to date, aearo has elected to pay the annual fee. aearo could potentially be exposed to additional claims for some part of the pre-july11, 1995 period covered by its agreement with cabot if aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this arrangement, or if cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these matters.
developments may occur that could affect the estimate of aearos liabilities. these developments include, but are not limited to: (i)significant changes in the number of future claims, (ii)significant changes in the average cost of resolving claims, (iii)significant changes in the legal costs of defending these claims, (iv)significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received, (v)trial and appellate outcomes, (vi)significant changes in the law and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii)significant changes in the liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii)the financial viability of members of the payor group including exhaustion of available coverage limits, (ix)the outcome of pending insurance coverage litigation among certain other members of the payor group and their respective insurers, and/or (x)a determination that the interpretation of the contractual obligations on which aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate. the company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its current estimate of aearos share of liability for these existing and future claims. if any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be significantly larger than the reserved amount.
because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have not yet been asserted, the complexity of allocating responsibility for future claims among the payor group, and the several possible developments that may occur that could affect the estimate of aearos liabilities, the company cannot estimate the amount or range of amounts by which aearos liability may exceed the reserve the company has established.
environmental matters and litigation
the companys operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and private parties in the united states and abroad. these laws and regulations provide, under certain circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination, for restoration of or compensation for damages to natural resources, and for personal injury and property damage claims. the company has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its environmental responsibilities. in its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.
under certain environmental laws, including the united states comprehensive environmental response, compensation and liability act of 1980 and similar state laws, the company may be jointly and severally liable, typically with other companies, for the costs of remediation of environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site locations. the company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in the united states, at which it may have some liability. please refer to the paragraph entitled environmental liabilities and insurance receivables that follows for information on the amount of the reserve.
environmental matters
as previously reported, the company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state, national (primarily the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)), and international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of various perfluorinated compounds (pfcs), including perfluorooctanoate or pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate or pfos and other perfluorooctanyl compounds. as a result of its phase-out decision in may2000, the company no longer manufactures perfluorooctanyl compounds. the company ceased manufacturing and using the vast majority of these compounds within approximately two years of the phase-out announcement, and ceased all manufacturing and the last significant use of this chemistry by 2008. through its ongoing life cycle management and its raw material composition identification processes associated with the companys policies covering the use of all persistent and bio-accumulative materials, the company has on rare occasion identified the
table of contents
presence of precursor chemicals in materials purchased from suppliers that may ultimately degrade to pfoa, pfos or similar compounds. upon such identification, the company works to find alternatives for such chemicals.
regulatory activities concerning pfoa and/or pfos continue in the united states, europe and elsewhere, and before certain international bodies. these activities include gathering of exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory approaches. the epa continues to develop drinking water health advisories for pfos and pfoa, which are expected to be released in 2012. those advisory levels will supersede the current provisional advisory levels. in an effort to move toward developing standards under the safe drinking water act, the epa has proposed to have public water suppliers monitor for six pfcs to determine the extent of their occurrence.
in late 2008 and early 2009, the epa undertook testing of private wells and soils at certain agricultural sites in alabama where wastewater treatment sludge was applied from the municipal wastewater treatment plant in decatur, alabama that received wastewater from numerous sources, including sanitary wastewater from 3m. in this same timeframe, the epa also issued provisional health advisory values for drinking water for pfoa of 0.4 parts per billion (ppb) and pfos of 0.2 ppb. pursuant to an information request from epa, a group of local industries, including 3m, and the decatur utility have been working to identify and test private wells in the area, and to connect to municipal water any private wells used for drinking water that exceed the epas provisional health advisory levels. epas and the industrys testing of public drinking water supplies in the area indicate that the levels of pfoa and pfos in municipal water supplies are well below the provisional health advisories. 3m and other companies have completed a survey of properties near the sites where decatur utilitys wastewater treatment sludge was applied to identify any additional private drinking water wells not already identified by the epa, and have connected a small number of wells that exceeded the provisional health advisory levels for pfos and pfoa to municipal water. 3m and the other companies have continued to monitor those few private wells that showed levels of pfos or pfoa above detection levels but below the epas provisional health advisory levels. epa has notified 3m that the agency is satisfied that 3m has completed its obligations under the information request and that epa is closing its request.
the agency for toxic substances and disease registry (atsdr) has completed a bio-monitoring study evaluating pfc blood levels in volunteers living near the sludge application fields. the company expects atsdr to release its report in 2012.
3m continues its third and final phase of work pursuant to a memorandum of understanding with the epa regarding an environmental assessment program at the companys decatur manufacturing site. that work includes groundwater sampling off-site from the decatur facility (unrelated to the work described above involving the decatur utilitys wastewater treatment sludge) as well as at three local landfills used by the facility.
the company is continuing to make progress in its work, under the supervision of state regulators, to address its historic disposal of pfc-containing waste associated with manufacturing operations at the cottage grove, minnesota and decatur, alabama plants.
as previously reported, the company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with the alabama department of environmental management (adem) to address the presence of pfcs in the soil at the companys manufacturing facility in decatur, alabama. for approximately twenty years, the company incorporated its wastewater treatment plant sludge containing pfcs in fields at its decatur facility pursuant to a permit issued by adem. after a review of the available options to address the presence of pfcs in the soil, adem agreed that the preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the former sludge incorporation areas on the manufacturing site with subsequent groundwater migration controls and treatment. implementation of that option will continue throughout the balance of 2012 and is expected to be completed in 2016.
the company continues to work with the minnesota pollution control agency (mpca) pursuant to the terms of the previously disclosed may2007 settlement agreement and consent order to address the presence of perfluorinated compounds in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in washington county, minnesota (oakdale and woodbury) and at the companys manufacturing facility in cottage grove, minnesota. under this agreement, the companys principal obligations include (i)evaluating releases of perfluorinated compounds from these sites and proposing response actions; (ii)providing treatment or alternative drinking water upon identifying any level exceeding a health based value (hbv) or health risk limit (hrl) (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water determined by the minnesota department of health to be safe for people to drink for a lifetime) for any perfluorinated compounds as a result of contamination from these sites; (iii)remediating any source of other pfcs at these sites that is not controlled by actions to remediate pfoa and pfos; and (iv)sharing information with the mpca about perfluorinated compounds. during 2008, the mpca issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites in washington county, minnesota (oakdale and woodbury). in august2009, the mpca issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the companys cottage grove manufacturing facility. during the spring and summer of 2010, 3m began implementing the remedial options at the cottage grove and woodbury sites. 3m commenced the remedial option at the oakdale site in late 2010. at each location the remedial options were among
table of contents
those recommended by the company. remediation work has been completed at the oakdale site, and it is in an operational maintenance mode. remediation will continue at the other two sites throughout the balance of 2012.
the company cannot predict what additional regulatory actions arising from the foregoing proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken regarding such compounds or the consequences of any such actions.
environmental litigation
as previously reported, a former employee filed a purported class action lawsuit in 2002 in the circuit court of morgan county, alabama seeking unstated damages and alleging that the plaintiffs suffered fear, increased risk, subclinical injuries, and property damage from exposure to perfluorochemicals at or near the companys decatur, alabama, manufacturing facility. the circuit court in 2005 granted the companys motion to dismiss the named plaintiffs personal injury-related claims on the basis that such claims are barred by the exclusivity provisions of the states workers compensation act. the plaintiffs counsel filed an amended complaint in november2006, limiting the case to property damage claims on behalf of a purported class of residents and property owners in the vicinity of the decatur plant. also, in 2005, the judge in a second purported class action lawsuit (filed by three residents of morgan county, alabama, seeking unstated compensatory and punitive damages involving alleged damage to their property from emissions of perfluorochemical compounds from the companys decatur, alabama, manufacturing facility that formerly manufactured those compounds) granted the companys motion to abate the case, effectively putting the case on hold pending the resolution of class certification issues in the first action described above filed in the same court in 2002. despite the stay, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking damages for alleged personal injuries and property damage on behalf of the named plaintiffs and the members of a purported class. no further action in the case is expected unless and until the stay is lifted.
in february2009, a resident of franklin county, alabama, filed a purported class action lawsuit in the circuit court of franklin county seeking compensatory damages and injunctive relief based on the application by the decatur utilitys wastewater treatment plant of wastewater treatment sludge to farmland and grasslands in the state that allegedly contain pfoa, pfos and other perfluorochemicals. the named defendants in the case include 3m, its subsidiary dyneon llc, daikin america,inc., synagro-wwt,inc., synagro south, llc and biological processors of america. the named plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all persons within the state of alabama who have had pfoa, pfos and other perfluorochemicals released or deposited on their property. in march2010, the alabama supreme court ordered the case transferred from franklin county to morgan county. in may, 2010, consistent with its handling of the other matters, the morgan county circuit court abated this case, putting it on hold pending the resolution of the class certification issues in the first case filed there.
in march2011, several residents of lawrence county, alabama, filed a lawsuit in the circuit court of lawrence county seeking unspecified compensatory and punitive damages and other relief for alleged personal injuries due to the exposure to pfcs. the named defendants in the case include the city of decatur, alabama, 3m, its subsidiary dyneon llc, daikin america,inc., toray industries,inc. and two of its u.s. subsidiaries, synagro-wwt,inc., synagro south, llc and biological processors of america, and certain individuals not associated with 3m. according to the complaint, synagro acquired wastewater treatment sludge that allegedly contained pfoa, pfos and other perfluorochemicals from the decatur utilitys wastewater treatment plant, and made it into a fertilizer that it sold to farmers who applied it to their farmland in morgan, limestone and lawrence counties, including land adjacent to the plaintiffs residence. plaintiffs have dismissed the city of decatur from the case and in december2011 agreed to settle with 3m for an amount that is not material to the companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
on december30, 2010, the state of minnesota, by its attorney general lori swanson, acting in its capacity as trustee of the natural resources of the state of minnesota, filed a lawsuit in hennepin county district court against 3m to recover damages (including unspecified assessment costs and reasonable attorneys fees) for alleged injury to, destruction of, and loss of use of certain of the states natural resources under the minnesota environmental response and liability act (merla) and the minnesota water pollution control act (mwpca), as well as statutory nuisance and common law claims of trespass, nuisance, and negligence with respect to the presence of pfcs in the groundwater, surface water, fish or other aquatic life and sediments. the state also seeks declarations under merla that 3m is responsible for all damages the state may suffer in the future for injuries to natural resources from releases of pfcs into the environment, and under mwpca that 3m is responsible for compensation for future loss or destruction of fish, aquatic life and other damages.
on january14, 2011, the city of lake elmo filed a motion to intervene in the state of minnesota lawsuit and seeks damages in excess of $50,000 and other legal and equitable relief, including reasonable attorneys fees, for alleged contamination of city property, wells, groundwater and water contained in the wells with pfcs under several theories, including common law and statutory nuisance, strict liability, trespass, negligence, and conversion. the court granted the city of lake elmos motion to intervene in this lawsuit.

on november7, 2011, the metropolitan council filed a motion to intervene and a complaint in the state of minnesota lawsuit seeking damages in excess of $50,000 and other legal, declaratory and equitable relief, including reasonable attorneys fees, for costs and fees that the metropolitan council alleges it will be required to assess at some time in the future if the minnesota pollution control agency imposes restrictions on metropolitan councils pfos discharges to the mississippi river. metropolitan councils intervention motion was based on several theories, including common law negligence, and statutory claims under merla for response costs and under the minnesota environmental rights act (mera) for declaratory and equitable relief against 3m for pfos and other pfc pollution of the waters and sediments of the mississippi river. 3m did not object to the motion to intervene. on january9, 2012, 3m answered the metropolitan councils complaint and filed a counterclaim alleging that the metropolitan council discharges pfcs to the mississippi river and discharges pfc-containing sludge and biosolids from one or more of its wastewater treatment plants onto agricultural lands and local area landfills. accordingly, 3m requested that if the court finds that the state is entitled to any of the damages the state seeks, 3m seeks contribution and apportionment from the metropolitan council, including attorneys fees, under merla, and contribution from and liability for the metropolitan councils proportional share of damages awarded to the state under the mwpca, as well as under statutory nuisance and common law theories of trespass, nuisance and negligence. 3m also seeks declaratory relief under mera.
in june2009, the company, along with more than 250 other companies, was served with a third-party complaint seeking contribution towards the cost of cleaning up a 17-mile stretch of the passaic river in new jersey. after commencing an enforcement action in 1990, the state of new jersey filed suit against maxus energy, tierra solutions, occidental chemical and two other companies seeking cleanup and removal costs and other damages associated with the presence of dioxin and other hazardous substances in the sediment of the passaic. the third-party complaint seeks to spread those costs among the third-party defendants, including the company. based on the cleanup remedy currently proposed by the epa, the total costs at issue could easily exceed $1 billion. the companys recent involvement in the case appears to relate to its past disposal of industrial waste at two commercial waste disposal facilities in new jersey. whether, and to what extent, the company may be required to contribute to the costs at issue in the case remains to be determined. the company does not yet have a basis for estimating its potential exposure in this case, although the company currently believes its allocable share, if any, is likely to be a fraction of one percent of the total costs.
for environmental litigation matters described in this section for which a liability, if any, has been recorded, the company believes the amount recorded, as well as the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established reserve is not material to the companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. for those matters for which a liability has not been recorded, the company believes such liability is not probable and estimable and the company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time, with the exception of the passaic river litigation, where the companys potential exposure, if any, is likely to be a fraction of one percent of the total costs.
environmental liabilities and insurance receivables
as of december31, 2011, the company had recorded liabilities of $28 million for estimated environmental remediation costs based upon an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual site and also recorded related insurance receivables of $15 million. the company records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the companys commitment to a plan of action. liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. the company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change. the company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 20 years.
as of december31, 2011, the company had recorded liabilities of $75 million for other environmental liabilities based upon an evaluation of currently available facts to implement the settlement agreement and consent order with the mpca, the remedial action agreement with adem, and to address trace amounts of perfluorinated compounds in drinking water sources in the city of oakdale, minnesota, as well as presence in the soil and groundwater at the companys manufacturing facilities in decatur, alabama, and cottage grove, minnesota, and at two former disposal sites in washington county, minnesota (oakdale and woodbury). the company expects that most of the spending will occur over the next five years.
it is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the existence of alternative cleanup methods. developments may occur that could affect the companys current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i)changes in the information available regarding the environmental impact of the companys operations and products; (ii)changes in environmental regulations, changes
table of contents
in permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii)new and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv)success in allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v)the financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors. for sites included in both environmental remediation liabilities and other environmental liabilities, at which remediation activity is largely complete and remaining activity relates primarily to operation and maintenance of the remedy, including required post-remediation monitoring, the company believes the exposure to loss in excess of the amount accrued would not be material to the companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. however, for locations at which remediation activity is largely ongoing, the company cannot estimate a possible loss or range of loss in excess of the associated established reserves for the reasons described above.
employment litigation
in january2011, 3m reached an agreement in principle with plaintiffs counsel to resolve the whitaker and garcia lawsuits. the whitaker settlement agreement was signed by all parties in march2011. the court granted preliminary approval of the settlement on april6, 2011, and provisionally certified a class for settlement purposes only. the final approval hearing occurred on december21, 2011 and the court issued its order and judgment on january5, 2012 approving the settlement. the garcia settlement agreement has been signed by the parties. all plaintiffs subject to the garcia settlement have signed and not timely revoked individual releases of claims against 3m, and the parties anticipate filing a stipulation of dismissal, with prejudice, in that matter following administration of the settlement, which will occur concurrently with administration of the whitaker settlement. if finalized and approved by the court, administration of the settlement agreements will take several months to complete. in september2011, 3m reached an agreement in the form of a proposed consent decree with the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission (eeoc) to resolve related charges as described below. the consent decree was filed concurrently with a complaint in the u.s. district court for the district of minnesota and has been approved by the court. the consent decree addressed the outstanding charges of age discrimination in addition to claims on behalf of a class of certain former employees as defined in the charges and subsequently in the complaint. 3m agreed, as part of the consent decree, to ensure that its policies and practices further the objectives of equal employment as set forth in the federal age discrimination in employment act and to make certain enhancements in its employee communications and development programs. the eeoc agreed, as part of the consent decree, not to take any further action against 3m in connection with the charges and as otherwise set forth in the decree. administration of the eeoc settlement is in process and will take several months to complete. the amount of each of the proposed settlements is not material to the companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. the background of this litigation is set forth below.
whitaker lawsuit
as previously reported, in december, 2004, one current and one former employee of the company filed a purported class action in the district court of ramsey county, minnesota, seeking to represent a class of all current and certain former salaried employees employed by the company in minnesota below a certain salary grade who were age 46 or older at any time during the applicable period to be determined by the court (the whitaker lawsuit). the complaint alleges the plaintiffs suffered various forms of employment discrimination on the basis of age in violation of the minnesota human rights act and seeks injunctive relief, unspecified compensatory damages (which they seek to treble under the statute), including back and front pay, punitive damages (limited by statute to $8,500 per claimant) and attorneys fees.
garcia lawsuit
the company was served on may7, 2009 with a purported class action/collective action age discrimination lawsuit, which was filed in united states district court for the northern district of california, san jose division (the garcia lawsuit). the case was subsequently transferred to the u.s. district court for the district of minnesota. the allegations in the garcia lawsuit are similar to those in the whitaker lawsuit.

six former employees and one current employee, all but one of whom are named plaintiffs in the garcia lawsuit, also filed age discrimination charges against the company with the eeoc and various pertinent state agencies, alleging age discrimination similar to the whitaker and garcia lawsuits and claiming that a class of similarly situated persons exists. these filings include allegations that the release of claims signed by certain former employees in the purported class defined in the charges is invalid for various reasons and assert age discrimination claims on behalf of certain current and former salaried employees in states other than minnesota and new jersey.

other matters
commercial litigation
in september2010, various parties, on behalf of a purported class of shareholders of cogent,inc. (cogent), commenced three lawsuits against the company, cogent, and its directors in the delaware court of chancery. plaintiffs allege that 3m, in connection with its tender offer for cogent shares, aided and abetted the breach of fiduciary duties by cogent directors and seek an unspecified amount of damages. the three cases were consolidated, expedited discovery was conducted, and plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction to enjoin the acquisition was denied on october1, 2010. on november15, 2010, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint that added cogent directors appointed by 3m, as named defendants, and asserted additional claims of breach of fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition and a subsequent offering period. 3m completed its acquisition of cogent in december2010. 3m moved to dismiss all claims. in response to 3ms motion, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint in august2011. 3m has moved to dismiss all claims of the second amended complaint.
in september2010, various parties, again on behalf of a purported class of cogent shareholders, commenced six lawsuits against the company, cogent and its directors in the los angeles superior court for the state of california that contained similar claims that 3m had aided and abetted the breach of fiduciary duties by cogent directors. the parties have reached a resolution of these matters. a separate lawsuit was commenced in september2010 by an individual, again on behalf of a purported class of cogent shareholders, against cogent and its directors in the united states district court for the central district of california that raised similar claims; plaintiff later filed an amended complaint that also named the company. the plaintiff has voluntarily dismissed that lawsuit.
separately, several purported holders of cogent shares, representing a total of approximately 5.8 million shares, have asserted appraisal rights under delaware law. the company has answered the appraisal petition and is defending this matter vigorously.
3m filed suit against avery dennison corporation in the united states district court for the district of minnesota in june2010, alleging that averys omnicube full cube retroreflective sheeting products, which are used for highway signage, infringe a number of 3m patents. 3ms motion to preliminarily enjoin the sales of averys omnicube retroreflective sheeting was denied in december2010. 3m also sought a declaratory judgment from the district court in minnesota that 3ms diamond grade dg3 full cube retroreflective sheeting does not infringe two avery patents. the district court granted averys motion to dismiss 3ms declaratory judgment suit in march2011. 3m has appealed the dismissal of the declaratory judgment lawsuit and expects a decision from the appellate court during the first half of 2012. in october2010, avery dennison filed a lawsuit against the company in the united states district court for the central district of california, alleging that 3m monopolized or attempted to monopolize the markets for type xi retroreflective sheeting and for broad high performance sheeting in violation of the sherman act, as well as other claims. avery alleges that 3m manipulated the standards-setting process of the american society for testing and materials (astm), a private organization responsible for creating standards for, among other things, retroreflective sheeting used for highway signage; entered into illegal and anticompetitive contracts; and engaged in other anticompetitive acts including false advertising and disparagement. 3ms motion to transfer the antitrust case to the united states district court for the district of minnesota was granted in february2011. 3ms patent infringement lawsuit against avery and averys antitrust suit against 3m are moving forward in the minnesota court.
in december2010, meda ab filed a lawsuit in the supreme court of the state of new york, county of new york, alleging breach of certain representations and warranties contained in the october2006 acquisition agreement pursuant to which meda ab acquired the companys european pharmaceutical business. the lawsuit seeks to recover an amount to be determined at trial, but not less than $200 million, in compensatory damages alleging that 3m failed to disclose, during the due diligence period, certain pricing arrangements between 3ms french subsidiary

and the french government agency that determines the eligible levels of reimbursement for prescription pharmaceuticals. the damage amounts specified in complaints are not a meaningful factor in any assessment of the companys potential liability. the company believes it has a number of legal and factual defenses to this claim and will vigorously defend it.
in december2008, the investors that sold acolyte biomedica,ltd. to the companys subsidiary in the united kingdom filed suit in londons high court seeking damages for breach of the acquisition agreement, including damages of 40 million pounds sterling for loss of potential earnout payments under the acquisition agreement. notwithstanding significant investments and efforts by the company to support the sales of baclite, a methicillin-resistant staphlococcus aureus (mrsa) screening device, the product was not a commercial success. a trial in londons high court took place from june15 to july18, 2011. on november7, 2011, the high court issued a judgment rejecting the bulk of claimants damages claim and awarded claimants $1.3 million.
for commercial litigation matters described in this section for which a liability, if any, has been recorded, the company believes the amount recorded, as well as the possible loss or range of loss in excess of the established reserve is not material to the companys consolidated results of operations or financial condition. for those matters for which a liability has not been recorded, the company believes that such liability is not probable and estimable and the company is not able to estimate a possible loss or range of loss at this time.

note 15. employee savings and stock ownership plans
the company sponsors employee savings plans under section401(k)of the internal revenue code. these plans are offered to substantially all regular u.s. employees. effective january1, 2010, substantially all company contributions to the plans are made in cash. during 2008 the board of directors approved various changes to the employee savings plans. for substantially all employees hired prior to january1, 2009, employee 401(k)contributions of up to 6% of eligible compensation are matched at rates of 60% or 75%, depending on the plan the employee participated in. employees hired on or after january1, 2009 receive a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k)contributions of up to 6% of eligible compensation and also receive an employer retirement income account cash contribution of 3% of the participants total eligible compensation. all contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to their elections.
the company maintained an employee stock ownership plan (esop) that was established in 1989 as a cost-effective way of funding the majority of the companys contributions under 401(k)employee savings plans. total esop shares were considered to be shares outstanding for earnings per share calculations. the esop debt matured in 2009.
dividends on shares held by the esop were paid to the esop trust and, together with company contributions, were used by the esop to repay principal and interest on the outstanding esop debt. the tax benefit related to dividends paid on unallocated shares was charged directly to equity and totaled approximately $1 million in 2009. over the life of the esop debt, shares were released for allocation to participants based on the ratio of the current years debt service to the remaining debt service prior to the current payment.
until 2009, the esop was the primary funding source for the companys employee savings plans. as permitted by accounting standards relating to employers accounting for employee stock ownership plans, the debt of the esop was recorded as debt, and shares pledged as collateral were reported as unearned compensation in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of changes in equity. unearned compensation was reduced symmetrically as the esop made principal payments on the debt. expenses related to the esop included total debt service on the notes, less dividends. the company contributed treasury shares (accounted for at fair value) and cash to employee savings plans to cover obligations not funded by the esop (reported as an employee benefit expense).

note 16. stock-based compensation
in may2008, shareholders approved 35 million shares for issuance under the 3m 2008 long-term incentive plan, which replaced and succeeded the 2005 management stock ownership program (msop), the 3m performance unit plan, and the 1992 directors stock ownership program. in may2010, shareholders approved an additional 29 million shares for issuance under the 2008 plan, increasing the number of approved shares from 35 million to 64 million shares. awards under this plan may be issued in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options, progressive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock, restricted stock units, other stock awards, and performance units and performance shares. awards denominated in shares of common stock other than options and stock appreciation rights, per the 2008 plan, count against the 64 million share limit as 3.38 shares for every one share covered by such award (for full value awards with grant dates prior to may11, 2010), or as 2.87 shares for every one share covered by such award (for full value awards with grant dates of may11, 2010, or later). the remaining total shares available for grant under the 2008 long term incentive plan program are 22,004,273 as of december31, 2011.
the companys annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant is made in februaryto provide a strong and immediate link between the performance of individuals during the preceding year and the size of their annual stock compensation grants. the grant to eligible employees uses the closing stock price on the grant date. stock options vest over a period from one to three years with the expiration date at 10 years from date of grant. accounting rulesrequire recognition of expense under a non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. employees are considered eligible to retire at age 55 and after having completed five years of service. this retiree-eligible population represents 28 percent of the 2011 annual stock-based compensation award expense dollars; therefore, higher stock-based compensation expense is recognized in the first quarter. beginning in 2007, the company reduced the number of traditional stock options granted under the msop plan by reducing the number of employees eligible to receive annual grants and by shifting a portion of the annual grant away from traditional stock options primarily to restricted stock units. however, associated with the reduction in the number of eligible employees, the company provided a one-time buyout grant in 2007 of restricted stock units to the impacted employees. 3m also has granted progressive (reload) options. these options are nonqualified stock options that were granted to certain participants under the 1997 or 2002 msop, but for which the reload feature was eliminated in 2005 (on a prospective basis only). participants who had options granted prior to this effective date may still qualify to receive new progressive (reload) stock options.
in addition to the annual grants, the company makes other minor grants of stock options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants. the company issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in certain countries. these grants do not result in the issuance of common stock and are considered immaterial by the company. there were approximately 12,944 participants with outstanding options, restricted stock, or restricted stock units at december31, 2011.
amounts recognized in the financial statements with respect to stock-based compensation programs, which include stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units, performance shares, and the general employees stock purchase plan (gespp), are provided in the following table. capitalized stock-based compensation amounts were not material for the twelve months ended 2011, 2010 and 2009. the income tax benefits shown in the table can fluctuate by period due to the amount of employee disqualifying dispositions related to incentive stock options (isos). the company last granted isos in 2002.

* weighted average
outstanding shares under option include grants from previous plans. for options outstanding at december31, 2011, the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 54 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $426 million. for options exercisable at december31, 2011, the weighted-average remaining contractual life was 44 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $352 million. as of december31, 2011, there was $57 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested stock option-based awards. this expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 1.7 years.
the total intrinsic values of stock options exercised during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, was $287 million, $263 million and $108 million. cash received from options exercised during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, was $796 million, $571 million and $345 million. the companys actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the exercise of employee stock options for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, was $96 million, $93 million and $38 million.
the company does not have a specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options; however, the company has historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends and other factors, to satisfy stock option exercise activity.
for annual and progressive (reload) options, the weighted average fair value at the date of grant was calculated using the black-scholes option-pricing model and the assumptions that follow.

expected volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to fluctuate during a period. for the 2011, 2010 and 2009 annual grant date, the company estimated the expected volatility based upon the average of the most recent one year volatility, the median of the term of the expected life rolling volatility, the median of the most recent term of the expected life volatility of 3m stock, and the implied volatility on the grant date. the expected term assumption is based on the weighted average of historical grants.

* weighted average
as of december31, 2011, there was $85 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units. this expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average vesting period of 2.1 years. the total fair value of restricted stock and restricted stock units that vested during the twelve-month periods ended december31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, was $102 million, $75 million and $10 million. the companys actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the vesting of restricted stock and restricted stock units was $36 million for 2011, $20 million for 2010, and was not material for 2009.
restricted stock units granted under the 3m 2008 long-term incentive plan generally vest three years following the grant date assuming continued employment. the one-time buyout restricted stock unit grant in 2007 vests at the end of five years. restricted stock unit grants issued in 2008 and prior did not accrue dividends during the vesting period. beginning in 2009, dividend equivalents equal to the dividends payable on the same number of shares of 3m common stock accrue on these restricted stock units during the vesting period, although no dividend equivalents are paid on any of these restricted stock units that are forfeited prior to the vesting date. dividend equivalents are paid out in cash at the vest date on all vested restricted stock units. since the rights to dividend equivalents are forfeitable, there is no impact on basic earnings per share calculations. weighted average restricted stock unit shares outstanding are included in the computation of diluted earnings per share.
performance shares
beginning in 2008, the company grants certain members of executive management performance shares on an annual basis. the performance criteria, which were modified in 2010, are designed to focus management attention on three key factors that create long-term stockholder value: organic sales growth, return on invested capital and sales from new products. the number of shares of 3m common stock that could actually be delivered at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from 0% to 200% of each performance share granted, depending on the performance of the company during such performance period. non-substantive vesting requires that expense for the performance shares be recognized over one or three years depending on when each individual became a 3m executive. the first performance shares, which were granted in 2008, were distributed in 2011. performance shares do not accrue dividends during the performance period. therefore, the grant date fair value is determined by reducing the closing stock price on the date of grant by the net present value of dividends during the performance period. as a result of the significant uncertainty due to the economic crisis of 2008-2009, the company granted restricted stock units instead of performance shares in 2009. performance share grants resumed in 2010 and continued thereafter. the 2008 performance share grant was estimated to have zero percent attainment at the beginning and ending of 2009.

as of december31, 2011, there was $11 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to performance shares. this expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining weighted-average earnings period of 0.8 years. the total fair value of performance shares that were distributed during the twelve-month periods ended december31, 2011 was $18 million, while none were distributed during 2010. the companys actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the distribution of performance shares was $5 million for 2011, with no tax benefits realized in 2010.
general employees stock purchase plan (gespp):
in may1997, shareholders approved 30 million shares for issuance under the companys gespp. substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the plan. participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of grant. there are no gespp shares under option at the beginning or end of each year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the last business day of the same month.

note 17. business segments
effective in the first quarter of 2011, 3m made certain product moves between its business segments in its continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets and customers. there were no changes impacting business segments related to product moves for the display and graphics segment or the consumer and office segment. the product moves between business segments are summarized as follows:
certain pressure sensitive adhesives products within the industrial adhesives and tapes division and shock absorption and vibration dampening products used in electronics within the aerospace and aircraft maintenance department (both within the industrial and transportation business segment) were transferred to the electronic markets materials division (part of the electro and communications business segment). in addition, certain medical respirator products within the infection prevention division (part of the health care business segment) were transferred to the occupational health and environmental safety division (within the safety, security and protection services business segment). the preceding product moves resulted in decreases in net sales for the total year 2010 of $152 million in the industrial and transportation business segment and $8 million in the health care business segment. these decreases were offset by increases in net sales for the total year 2010 of $121 million for the electro and communications business segment and $8 million for the safety, security and protection services business segment along with a $31 million change in the elimination of dual credit sales and corporate and unallocated.
3ms businesses are organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in products, technologies and services. 3m continues to manage its operations in six operating business segments: industrial and transportation; health care; consumer and office; safety, security and protection services; display and graphics; and electro and communications. 3ms six business segments bring together common or related 3m technologies, enhancing the development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of business resources. these segments have worldwide responsibility for virtually all 3m product lines. 3m is not dependent on any single product/service or market. certain small businesses and lab-sponsored products, as well as various corporate assets and expenses, are not attributed to the business segments. transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost.
the financial information presented herein reflects the impact of all of the preceding segment structure changes for all periods presented.

corporate and unallocated operating income includes a variety of miscellaneous items, such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses, certain insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension, stock-based compensation) that the company may choose not to allocate directly to its business segments. because this category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
3m business segment reporting measures include dual credit to business segments for certain u.s. sales and related operating income. management evaluates each of its six operating business segments based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit u.s. reporting to further incentivize u.s. sales growth. as a result, 3m provides additional (dual) credit to those business segments selling products in the u.s. to an external customer when that segment is not the primary seller of the product. for example, certain respirators are primarily sold by the occupational health and environmental safety division within the safety, security and protection services business segment; however, the industrial and transportation business segment also sells this product to certain customers in its u.s. markets. in this example, the non-primary selling segment (industrial and transportation) would also receive credit for the associated net sales it initiated and the related approximate operating income. the assigned operating income related to dual credit activity may differ from operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such sales. the offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as a reconciling item entitled elimination of dual credit, such that sales and operating income for the u.s. in total are unchanged.
3m is an integrated enterprise characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers. therefore, management does not represent that its business segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income and other financial information shown. the difference between operating income and pre-tax income relates to interest income and interest expense, which are not allocated to business segments. segment operating income and assets in the preceding table include allocations resulting from the shared utilization of certain corporate or otherwise unallocated assets. however, the separate amounts stated for segment depreciation, amortization, and capital expenditures are based on secondary performance measures used by management that do not include allocations of certain corporate items.
segment assets for the operating business segments (excluding corporate and unallocated) primarily include accounts receivable; inventory; property, plant and equipment  net; goodwill and intangible assets; and other miscellaneous assets. assets included in corporate and unallocated principally are cash, cash equivalents and marketable securities; insurance receivables; deferred income taxes; certain investments and other assets, including prepaid pension assets. corporate and unallocated assets can change from year to year due to changes in cash,

cash equivalents and marketable securities, changes in prepaid pension benefits, and changes in other unallocated asset categories.
the most significant items impacting 2009 results were restructuring actions. refer to note 4 for discussion of restructuring actions.
note 18. geographic areas
geographic area information is used by the company as a secondary performance measure to manage its businesses. export sales and certain income and expense items are generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are made.

item 9. changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting and financial disclosure.
none.
item 9a. controls and procedures.
a. the company carried out an evaluation, under the supervision and with the participation of its management, including the chief executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the design and operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures (as defined in the exchange act rule13a-15(e)) as of the end of the period covered by this report. based upon that evaluation, the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
b. the companys management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the exchange act rule13a-15(f). management conducted an assessment of the companys internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control  integrated framework. based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of december31, 2011, the companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2011 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2011.
c. there was no change in the companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the companys most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal control over financial reporting.
the company is implementing an enterprise resource planning (erp) system on a worldwide basis, which is expected to improve the efficiency of certain financial and related transaction processes. the gradual implementation is expected to occur in phases over the next several years. the implementation of a worldwide erp system will likely affect the processes that constitute our internal control over financial reporting and will require testing for effectiveness.
the company completed implementation with respect to elements of certain processes/sub-processes in limited subsidiaries/locations and will continue to roll-out the erp system over the next several years. as with any new information technology application we implement, this application, along with the internal controls over financial reporting included in this process, was appropriately considered within the testing for effectiveness with respect to the implementation in these instances. we concluded, as part of our evaluation described in the above paragraphs, that the implementation of erp in these circumstances has not materially affected our internal control over financial reporting.
item 9b. other information.
