THE CONFIDENCE OF WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS, JOBBERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS IN

AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES, HAS CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO 3MS POSITION IN

THE MARKETPLACE AND TO ITS GROWTH. 3M HAS 189 SALES OFFICES WORLDWIDE, WITH 15

RESEARCH, PATENTS AND RAW

MATERIALS

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT CONSTITUTE AN IMPORTANT PART OF 3MS ACTIVITIES. PRODUCTS RESULTING

FROM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAVE BEEN A MAJOR DRIVER OF 3MS GROWTH.

$1.102 BILLION IN 2003 AND $1.070 BILLION IN 2002. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

COVERING BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES

TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND IMPROVED PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, TOTALED $759

MILLION IN 2004, $749 MILLION IN 2003 AND $738 MILLION IN 2002. RELATED

EXPENSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS FOR EXISTING

PRODUCTS BY 3M LABORATORIES.

3M

REALIGNED ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS IN 2003. THIS REALIGNMENT WAS

DESIGNED TO DEVELOP TECHNOLOGIES NEEDED FOR THE FUTURE, TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN

TECHNICAL RESOURCES WITH BUSINESS PRIORITIES, AND TO SHORTEN THE DISTANCE

BETWEEN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND 3MS CUSTOMERS. 3M ESTABLISHED A SINGLE

GLOBAL CORPORATE RESEARCH LABORATORY, WHICH BRINGS TOGETHER MORE THAN 600

RESEARCHERS FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGY BUILDING WHILE ALSO FREEING UP APPROXIMATELY

400 OTHER 3M TECHNICAL PEOPLE TO DIRECTLY SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF 3M BUSINESS

UNITS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS

ARE SOLD AROUND THE WORLD UNDER VARIOUS TRADEMARKS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY ALSO OWNS, OR HOLDS LICENSES TO USE, NUMEROUS U.S. AND

FOREIGN PATENTS. THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES CONTINUOUSLY

GENERATE NEW INVENTIONS THAT ARE COVERED BY PATENTS. PATENTS APPLICABLE TO

SPECIFIC PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR VARYING PERIODS ACCORDING TO THE DATE OF PATENT

APPLICATION FILING OR PATENT GRANT AND THE LEGAL TERM OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS

COUNTRIES WHERE

5

PATENT PROTECTION IS

OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY A PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY FROM

COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE

AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN THE COUNTRY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THAT ITS PATENTS PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN MANY OF ITS

BUSINESSES. IN GENERAL, NO SINGLE PATENT OR GROUP OF RELATED PATENTS IS IN

ITSELF ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE OR TO ANY OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. THE IMPORTANCE OF PATENTS IN THE HEALTH CARE AND DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS

SEGMENTS IS DESCRIBED IN PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT  HEALTH CARE

BUSINESS AND DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS BUSINESS IN PART II, ITEM 7, OF THIS FORM

10-K.

IN 2004, THE COMPANY

EXPERIENCED BOTH PRICE INCREASES AND SUPPLY LIMITATIONS AFFECTING SEVERAL

OIL-DERIVED RAW MATERIALS, BUT TO DATE THE COMPANY IS RECEIVING SUFFICIENT

QUANTITIES OF SUCH MATERIALS TO MEET ITS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE PRODUCTION

REQUIREMENTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT FUTURE SHORTAGES OF RAW MATERIALS OR

THE IMPACT ANY SUCH SHORTAGES WOULD HAVE.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

3MS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY

NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AROUND THE WORLD. 3M HAS MADE, AND

PLANS TO CONTINUE MAKING, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE

LAWS. 3M IS ALSO INVOLVED IN REMEDIATION ACTIONS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS FROM PAST OPERATIONS AT CERTAIN SITES (REFER TO PART I, ITEM 3, LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS).

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXISTING

CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR

FUTURE REVENUES ARE EXPENSED. ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS

THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE OPERATIONS GENERALLY ARE CAPITALIZED AND

DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.

IN 2004, 3M EXPENDED ABOUT $17 MILLION FOR CAPITAL

PROJECTS RELATED TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPARABLE AMOUNT IN 2003

WAS ABOUT $40 MILLION. THESE AMOUNTS EXCLUDE EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION

ACTIONS RELATING TO EXISTING MATTERS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS. CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES HAVE INCLUDED POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICES

 SUCH AS WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT IMPROVEMENTS, SCRUBBERS, CONTAINMENT

STRUCTURES, SOLVENT RECOVERY UNITS AND THERMAL OXIDIZERS  AT NEW AND EXISTING

FACILITIES CONSTRUCTED OR UPGRADED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. CONSISTENT

WITH THE COMPANYS POLICIES STRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY, AVERAGE

ANNUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (OTHER THAN FOR REMEDIATION PROJECTS) ARE PRESENTLY

EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $23 MILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS FOR NEW OR EXPANDED

PROGRAMS TO BUILD FACILITIES OR MODIFY MANUFACTURING PROCESSES TO MINIMIZE

WASTE AND REDUCE EMISSIONS.

WHILE THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE

FUTURE COSTS OF SUCH CLEANUP ACTIVITIES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING

COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

ITEM 3.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY AND SOME OF

ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS, PRINCIPALLY IN

THE UNITED STATES, AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS WORLDWIDE. THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS

PRODUCTS LIABILITY (INVOLVING PRODUCTS THAT THE COMPANY NOW OR FORMERLY

MANUFACTURED AND SOLD), INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND COMMERCIAL CLAIMS AND

LAWSUITS, INCLUDING THOSE BROUGHT UNDER THE ANTITRUST LAWS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL

PROCEEDINGS. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS FIRST DESCRIBE THE SIGNIFICANT LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED, AND THEN DESCRIBE THE LIABILITIES

AND ASSOCIATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES THE COMPANY HAS ACCRUED RELATING TO ITS

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, THE COMPANY IS

VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ALL SUCH LITIGATION.

ANTITRUST LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED,

LEPAGES INC., A TRANSPARENT TAPE COMPETITOR OF 3M, FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN JUNE 1997 ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN MARKETING PRACTICES OF THE COMPANY

CONSTITUTED UNLAWFUL MONOPOLIZATION UNDER THE ANTITRUST LAWS. AS A RESULT OF AN

APPEALS COURT RULING, 3M RECORDED A CHARGE OF $93 MILLION (PRE-TAX) IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. ON JUNE 30, 2004, THE SUPREME COURT DENIED 3MS PETITION

TO REVIEW THE APPEALS COURT RULING, WHICH CONCLUDED THE LEPAGES LAWSUIT

AGAINST 3M. THE COMPANY PAID LEPAGES $96.5 MILLION FOR THE JUDGMENT, INTEREST

AND ATTORNEYS FEES ON JULY 2, 2004.

FOLLOWING THE LEPAGES

VERDICT AND APPELLATE RULINGS, CERTAIN DIRECT AND INDIRECT TAPE PURCHASERS

FILED MULTIPLE PURPORTED CLASS ACTIONS

AND ONE INDIVIDUAL ACTION AGAINST THE COMPANY IN VARIOUS STATE AND

FEDERAL COURTS. TWELVE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF INDIRECT

PURCHASERS OF TAPE ARE NOW PENDING IN CALIFORNIA, PENNSYLVANIA, FLORIDA,

TENNESSEE, WISCONSIN, KANSAS, SOUTH CAROLINA, NEW MEXICO, AND IOWA, AND TWO

BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF DIRECT PURCHASERS ARE PENDING IN THE FEDERAL COURT IN

PHILADELPHIA (SOME OF THE PENDING ACTIONS WERE FILED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2004 AND ONE WAS FILED IN JANUARY 2005). THESE CASES ALLEGE THAT THE COMPANY

COMPETED UNFAIRLY AND UNLAWFULLY MONOPOLIZED ALLEGED MARKETS FOR TRANSPARENT

TAPE, AND THEY SEEK TO RECOVER ON BEHALF OF VARIOUSLY DEFINED CLASSES OF DIRECT

AND INDIRECT PURCHASERS DAMAGES IN THE FORM OF PRICE OVERCHARGES THE COMPANY

ALLEGEDLY CHARGED FOR THESE PRODUCTS. IN THE CASE IN FEDERAL COURT IN

CALIFORNIA IN WHICH THE LOWER COURT HAD PREVIOUSLY GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION

FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS GRANTED THE PARTIES

JOINT REQUEST TO HOLD THE PLAINTIFFS APPEAL OF THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT RULING IN

ABEYANCE PENDING SETTLEMENT DISCUSSIONS.

3M HAS REACHED A PROPOSED

SETTLEMENT IN FEBRUARY 2005 WITH ALL NAMED PLAINTIFFS IN THE 12 INDIRECT

PURCHASER ANTITRUST PUTATIVE CLASS ACTIONS PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY IN THE VARIOUS

STATE COURTS NOTED ABOVE AND IN THE CALIFORNIA FEDERAL COURT.  IF AN AGREEMENT IS EXECUTED BY THE PARTIES AND

RECEIVES FEDERAL COURT APPROVAL AND ALL CONDITIONS IN THE AGREEMENT ARE

SATISFIED, THE SETTLEMENT WOULD TERMINATE ALL 12 ACTIONS AND RELEASE THE CLAIMS

OF CLASS MEMBERS NATIONWIDE. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT IS NOT

MATERIAL TO 3M. THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT DOES NOT AFFECT THE CLASS AND

INDIVIDUAL ACTIONS BROUGHT BY DIRECT PURCHASERS OF 3M TRANSPARENT TAPE THAT ARE

PENDING IN A FEDERAL COURT IN PENNSYLVANIA AND DOES NOT CONSTITUTE ANY

ADMISSION OF LIABILITY BY THE COMPANY.

PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS

CONTINUE IN THE DIRECT PURCHASER CLASS ACTION PENDING IN THE FEDERAL COURT IN

PHILADELPHIA. IN AUGUST 2004, THAT COURT CERTIFIED A CLASS CONSISTING OF ALL 3M

CUSTOMERS WHO DIRECTLY BOUGHT TRANSPARENT AND INVISIBLE TAPE (BUT NOT PRIVATE

LABEL TAPE) FROM OCTOBER 1998 TO THE PRESENT. THEREAFTER, TWO ADDITIONAL

LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY BY ALLEGED DIRECT TAPE PURCHASERS IN

THE FEDERAL COURT IN PHILADELPHIA. IN ONE, THE PLAINTIFF OPTED OUT OF THE CLASS

DESCRIBED ABOVE AND FILED AN INDIVIDUAL LAWSUIT IN SEPTEMBER 2004. IN THE OTHER,

THE PLAINTIFF FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION IN DECEMBER 2004 ON BEHALF OF

CUSTOMERS (PRIVATE LABEL TAPE PURCHASERS) EXCLUDED FROM THE AUGUST CLASS

CERTIFICATION ORDER; THE COMPANY HAS MOVED TO DISMISS THAT ACTION AS UNTIMELY

AND ON OTHER GROUNDS.

BREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION

THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN

OTHER COMPANIES WERE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS

ALLEGING DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES OF VARIOUS TYPES RESULTING FROM BREAST

IMPLANTS FORMERLY MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY OR A RELATED COMPANY. THE VAST

MAJORITY OF CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN RESOLVED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

CONSIDER ITS REMAINING PROBABLE LIABILITY TO BE MATERIAL. INFORMATION

CONCERNING THE ASSOCIATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLE AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO

IT FOLLOWS IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED

BREAST

IMPLANT INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS

LITIGATION

FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS,

THE COMPANY HAS DEFENDED AND RESOLVED THE CLAIMS OF OVER 340,000 INDIVIDUAL

CLAIMANTS ALLEGING INJURIES FROM OCCUPATIONAL DUST EXPOSURES. AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2004, THE COMPANY IS A NAMED DEFENDANT, WITH MULTIPLE CO-DEFENDANTS, IN

NUMEROUS LAWSUITS IN VARIOUS COURTS THAT PURPORT TO REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY

76,600 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS, A DECREASE FROM THE APPROXIMATELY 88,700 INDIVIDUAL

CLAIMANTS WITH ACTIONS PENDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

9

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE

LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RESOLVED BY AND CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY

ALLEGE USE OF SOME OF THE COMPANYS MASK AND RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND SEEK

DAMAGES FROM THE COMPANY AND OTHER DEFENDANTS FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY FROM

WORKPLACE EXPOSURES TO ASBESTOS, SILICA, COAL OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS,

FOUND IN PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS OR GENERALLY IN THE WORKPLACE.

THE REMAINING CLAIMANTS GENERALLY ALLEGE PERSONAL INJURY FROM OCCUPATIONAL

EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS FROM PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY,

WHICH ARE OFTEN UNSPECIFIED, AND BY OTHER DEFENDANTS, OR OCCASIONALLY AT

COMPANY PREMISES.

IN MANY OF THESE LAWSUITS

AND CLAIMS, THE COMPANY IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT WITH MULTIPLE CO-DEFENDANTS

WHERE NO PRODUCT THE COMPANY MANUFACTURED IS INVOLVED OR WHERE THE COMPANY IS

ULTIMATELY DETERMINED NOT TO HAVE MANUFACTURED THE PRODUCTS IDENTIFIED BY THE

PLAINTIFFS. THE COMPANYS VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF THIS LITIGATION HAS RESULTED IN.

(I) DISMISSALS OF MANY LAWSUITS WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT BY THE COMPANY; (II) AN

AVERAGE SETTLEMENT VALUE OF LESS THAN $1,000 PER CLAIMANT FOR ALL OF THE CLAIMS

AND LAWSUITS THAT THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED, INCLUDING THOSE DISMISSED WITHOUT

PAYMENT; AND (III) JURY VERDICTS FOR THE COMPANY IN SIX OF THE SEVEN CASES

TRIED TO VERDICT, AND AN APPELLATE REVERSAL OF THE ONE JURY VERDICT ADVERSE TO

THE COMPANY.

ON JANUARY 20, 2005, THE

MISSISSIPPI SUPREME COURT REVERSED THE $22.5 MILLION JURY VERDICT ADVERSE TO

THE COMPANY THAT WAS RETURNED IN HOLMES COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI, IN 2001. THE

SUPREME COURT RULED, IN PART, THAT THE PLAINTIFFS FAILED TO PROVE ANY CLAIM

AGAINST THE COMPANYS RESPIRATORY PRODUCTS AND IN EFFECT THAT THE TRIAL JUDGE

SHOULD NOT HAVE SUBMITTED THE CASE TO THE JURY IN THE FIRST PLACE. THE

MISSISSIPPI SUPREME COURTS DECISION IS FINAL AND TERMINATES THE CLAIMS OF THE

PLAINTIFFS AGAINST THE COMPANY. IT WILL NOT AFFECT 3MS EARNINGS OR RESERVES.

ON FEBRUARY 3, 2005, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED A PETITION FOR REHEARING WITH THE MISSISSIPPI

SUPREME COURT TO WHICH THE COMPANY OPPOSED.

OF THE CLAIMS CURRENTLY

PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY NOTED ABOVE, THE COMPANY JOINED OTHER DEFENDANTS IN

REMOVING APPROXIMATELY 7,600 SILICA-RELATED CLAIMS FROM CERTAIN MISSISSIPPI

STATE COURTS TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURTS FOR THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN

DISTRICT OF MISSISSIPPI. THESE CLAIMS WERE SUBSEQUENTLY CONSOLIDATED BEFORE A

SINGLE FEDERAL COURT IN THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS (CORPUS CHRISTI) FOR

COORDINATED PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS. THE COMPANY HAS MANUFACTURED AND CONTINUES TO

MANUFACTURE CERTAIN PRODUCTS THAT CONTAIN SILICA, BUT DOES NOT BELIEVE THESE

PRODUCTS POSE A HEALTH RISK TO ANY USER OR BYSTANDER WHEN USED AS INTENDED. THE

COMPANY UNDERSTANDS THAT THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE CLAIMS, HOWEVER, ARE BASED

ON ALLEGED USE OF SOME OF THE COMPANYS MASK AND RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE ASSERTED

SPECIFIC DOLLAR CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES IN APPROXIMATELY 57% OF THE 10,967 LAWSUITS

THAT WERE PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY AT THE END OF 2004 IN ALL JURISDICTIONS.

A MAJORITY OF STATES RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT SPECIFYING DAMAGES IN TORT CASES SUCH

AS THESE, AND MOST OF THE REMAINING JURISDICTIONS DO NOT REQUIRE SUCH SPECIFICATION.

IN THOSE CASES IN WHICH PLAINTIFFS CHOOSE TO ASSERT SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN

THEIR COMPLAINTS, BROUGHT IN STATES THAT PERMIT SUCH PLEADING, THE AMOUNTS

CLAIMED ARE TYPICALLY NOT MEANINGFUL AS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL

LIABILITY. THIS IS BECAUSE (A) THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED TYPICALLY BEAR NO RELATION

TO THE EXTENT OF THE PLAINTIFFS INJURY, IF ANY; (B) THE COMPLAINTS NEARLY

ALWAYS ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS, WITH THE TYPICAL COMPLAINT

ASSERTING CLAIMS AGAINST MORE THAN 50 DIFFERENT DEFENDANTS, THE DAMAGES ALLEGED

ARE NOT ATTRIBUTED TO INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS, AND A DEFENDANTS SHARE OF

LIABILITY MAY TURN ON THE LAW OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY, WHICH CAN VARY BY

STATE, AND BY THE AMOUNT OF FAULT A JURY ALLOCATES TO EACH DEFENDANT IF A CASE

IS ULTIMATELY TRIED BEFORE A JURY; (C) MANY CASES ARE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY

EVEN THOUGH THE PLAINTIFFS DID NOT USE ANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND,

ULTIMATELY, ARE WITHDRAWN OR DISMISSED WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT; AND (D) MANY CASES

ARE BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFFS WHO HAVE NOT SUFFERED ANY MEDICAL INJURY,

AND, ULTIMATELY, ARE RESOLVED WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT OR A PAYMENT THAT IS A SMALL

FRACTION OF THE DAMAGES INITIALLY CLAIMED. OF THE 6,248 PENDING CASES IN WHICH

PURPORTED DAMAGE AMOUNTS ARE SPECIFIED IN THE COMPLAINTS, 5,383 CASES INVOLVE

CLAIMS OF $100,000 OR LESS (TWO OF THESE CASES ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF

$10,000 AND $75,000 RESPECTIVELY), 215 CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS BETWEEN $100,000

AND $3 MILLION (83 OF THESE CASES ALSO EACH ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF

$250,000, ONE OF THEM ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $1 MILLION, 46 OF THEM

ALSO EACH ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $1.5 MILLION, 72 OF THEM EACH ALLEGE

PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $2 MILLION, AND ONE OF THEM ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES

OF $3 MILLION), 62 CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $7.5 MILLION, ONE CASE HAS CLAIMS OF

$8.7 MILLION AND ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $5 MILLION, 519 CASES INVOLVE

CLAIMS OF $10 MILLION (ONE OF THESE CASES ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF

$350,000, AND 446 OF THEM ALSO EACH ALLEGE $10 MILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES), 16

CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $15 MILLION (14 OF THESE CASES ALSO EACH ALLEGE $15

MILLION IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES), 50 CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $20 MILLION (ALL OF

WHICH ALSO ALLEGE AN EQUAL AMOUNT IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES), AND TWO CASES INVOLVE

CLAIMS OF $50 MILLION (ONE OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $50

MILLION). SOME COMPLAINTS ALLEGE THAT THE COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE

AT LEAST THE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED, THE COMPANY HAS MORE THAN

25 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN DEFENDING LITIGATION OF THIS TYPE, HAS RESOLVED THE

CLAIMS OF OVER 340,000 INDIVIDUALS WITH A CUMULATIVE AVERAGE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT

OF LESS THAN $1,000 PER CLAIMANT, AND BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE AND FOR THE

OTHER REASONS CITED,

10

BELIEVES THAT THE DAMAGE

AMOUNTS SPECIFIED IN COMPLAINTS ARE NOT A MEANINGFUL FACTOR IN ANY ASSESSMENT

OF THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY.

THE STATE OF WEST

VIRGINIA, THROUGH ITS ATTORNEY GENERAL, FILED A COMPLAINT IN 2003 AGAINST THE

COMPANY AND TWO OTHER MANUFACTURERS OF RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS IN THE

CIRCUIT COURT OF LINCOLN COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS

SUBSTANTIAL, BUT UNSPECIFIED, COMPENSATORY DAMAGES PRIMARILY FOR REIMBURSEMENT

OF THE COSTS ALLEGEDLY INCURRED BY THE STATE FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION AND

HEALTHCARE BENEFITS PROVIDED TO MORE THAN 20,000 CURRENT OR FORMER MINERS

ALLEGEDLY SUFFERING FROM SILICOSIS AND/OR COAL MINERS PNEUMOCONIOSIS (BLACK

LUNG DISEASE). THE COMPLAINT ALSO SEEKS UNQUANTIFIED PUNITIVE DAMAGES. ON

JANUARY 25, 2005, THE FEDERAL COURT TO WHICH THE COMPANY AND THE CO-DEFENDANTS

REMOVED THE CASE GRANTED THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIAS MOTION TO REMAND THE CASE

TO THE STATE COURT WHERE THE CASE WAS ORIGINALLY FILED. THE COMPANY AND THE

CO-DEFENDANTS HAVE FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE CASE.

EMPLOYMENT LITIGATION

ON DECEMBER 21, 2004, ONE

CURRENT AND ONE FORMER EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION

IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF RAMSEY COUNTY, MINNESOTA, SEEKING TO REPRESENT A CLASS

OF ALL SALARIED EMPLOYEES EMPLOYED BY 3M IN MINNESOTA BELOW A CERTAIN SALARY

GRADE WHO WERE AGE 46 OR OLDER AT ANY TIME DURING THE APPLICABLE PERIOD TO BE

DETERMINED BY THE COURT. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THE PLAINTIFFS SUFFERED VARIOUS

FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF AGE IN VIOLATION OF THE

MINNESOTA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT AND SEEKS UNSPECIFIED INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, AND

COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $50,000 PER PLAINTIFF AND CLASS

MEMBER.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND

LITIGATION

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS

ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS ENFORCEABLE BY NATIONAL,

STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AROUND THE WORLD, AND PRIVATE PARTIES IN THE UNITED

STATES AND ABROAD, INCLUDING THOSE PERTAINING TO AIR EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER

DISCHARGES, TOXIC SUBSTANCES, AND THE HANDLING AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID AND

HAZARDOUS WASTES. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS PROVIDE, UNDER CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, A BASIS FOR THE REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATION, AS WELL AS

PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS. THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED, AND WILL

CONTINUE TO INCUR, COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN COMPLYING WITH THESE LAWS

AND REGULATIONS, DEFENDING PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS, AND

MODIFYING ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN LIGHT OF ITS ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITIES. IN ITS EFFORT TO SATISFY ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES

AND COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE COMPANY HAS

ESTABLISHED, AND PERIODICALLY UPDATES, POLICIES RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL

STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR ITS OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE.

REMEDIATION

.

UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES COMPREHENSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980 AND SIMILAR

STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY MAY BE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE, TYPICALLY WITH

OTHER COMPANIES, FOR THE COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AT CURRENT OR

FORMER FACILITIES AND AT OFF-SITE LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED

NUMEROUS LOCATIONS, MOST OF WHICH ARE IN THE UNITED STATES, AT WHICH IT MAY HAVE

SOME LIABILITY. PLEASE REFER TO THE FOLLOWING SECTION, ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND

INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS FOR MORE INFORMATION ON

THIS SUBJECT.

REGULATORY

ACTIVITIES

: THE COMPANY HAS BEEN VOLUNTARILY COOPERATING WITH

ONGOING REVIEWS BY LOCAL, STATE, NATIONAL (PRIMARILY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL

PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)), AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES OF POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL

AND HEALTH EFFECTS OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS (PERFLUROOCTANOIC ACID OR

PFOA AND PERFLUOROOCTANE SULFONATE OR PFOS). AS A RESULT OF ITS PHASE-OUT

DECISION IN MAY 2000, THE COMPANY NO LONGER MANUFACTURES PERFLUOROOCTANYL

COMPOUNDS EXCEPT THAT A SUBSIDIARY RECYCLES PFOA FOR ITS MANUFACTURING

OPERATIONS.

THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED

EPA CONSENT ORDER NEGOTIATING PROCESS TO OBTAIN ADDITIONAL INFORMATION TO

ENABLE THE EPA TO FURTHER DEVELOP A HUMAN HEALTH RISK ASSESSMENT AND IDENTIFY

ROUTES OF EXPOSURE CONCERNING PFOA IS IN PROGRESS. THE EPA SIGNED A MEMORANDUM

OF UNDERSTANDING WITH THE COMPANY AND DYNEON LLC, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY,

ON OCTOBER 25, 2004, UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY IS MONITORING AT AND AROUND THE

COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN DECATUR, ALABAMA THE POTENTIAL PRESENCE OF

PFOA.

ON JANUARY 12, 2005, THE

EPA ISSUED A DRAFT RISK ASSESSMENT FOR PFOA AND SUBMITTED IT FOR REVIEW TO A

SCIENCE ADVISORY BOARD THAT THE EPA EMPANELLED. THE EPA DOCUMENT EXPRESSES THE

EPAS PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT IN TERMS OF THE MARGIN OF EXPOSURE BETWEEN THE

LEVELS OF THAT COMPOUND THAT CAUSE ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS IN LABORATORY ANIMALS

AND THE LEVELS FOUND IN HUMAN BLOOD SERA IN THE U.S. POPULATION.

ON OCTOBER 2, 2004, A

CANADIAN REGULATORY AGENCY, HEALTH CANADA, ISSUED A DRAFT REPORT CONCLUDING

THAT EXPOSURES TO PFOS DO NOT POSE A RISK TO HUMAN HEALTH IN THAT COUNTRY.

ANOTHER CANADIAN AGENCY, ENVIRONMENT CANADA, ISSUED A SEPARATE DRAFT REPORT AT

THE SAME TIME PROPOSING TO REGULATE PFOS ON THE GROUND THAT IT COULD BE HARMFUL

TO THE ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY HAS SUBMITTED COMMENTS ON EACH DRAFT REPORT.

11

REGULATORY EVALUATION

ACTIVITIES CONTINUE IN THE EUROPEAN UNION (INCLUDING SOME OF ITS MEMBER

COUNTRIES), OTHER COUNTRIES AND CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL BODIES AS TO PFOA AND/OR

PFOS. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE GATHERING OF EXPOSURE AND USE INFORMATION,

PRELIMINARY RISK ASSESSMENT, AND EXAMINATION OF REGULATORY APPROACHES.

THE COMPANY, IN

COOPERATION WITH LOCAL AND STATE AGENCIES, TESTED GROUNDWATER BENEATH TWO

FORMER WASTE DISPOSAL SITES IN WASHINGTON COUNTY, MINNESOTA, USED MANY YEARS

AGO BY THE COMPANY TO DISPOSE OF WASTE CONTAINING PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS.

THE TEST RESULTS SHOW THAT WATER FROM MUNICIPAL WELLS NEAR THE FORMER DISPOSAL

SITES CONTAIN LOW LEVELS OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS (PFOS AND PFOA) THAT THE

MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH DOES NOT CURRENTLY CONSIDER TO POSE A HEALTH

RISK. ADDITIONAL TESTING WILL BE CONDUCTED AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO ASSIST

THE GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES IN ADDRESSING SUCH CIRCUMSTANCES AS APPROPRIATE.

THE COMPANY HAS COMPLETED

THE SELF-AUDIT IT AGREED WITH THE EPA IN JUNE 1999 TO UNDERTAKE CONCERNING ITS

COMPLIANCE WITH THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT (TSCA) THAT INCLUDED THE TSCA

SECTION 8(E) REPORTING REQUIREMENT AS APPLIED TO STUDIES ON PERFLUOROOCTANYL

CHEMISTRY AND OTHER PRODUCTS. BASED ON COMMUNICATIONS WITH EPA, THE COMPANY

UNDERSTANDS THAT EPA IS PRESENTLY EVALUATING THE RESULTS OF THIS SELF-AUDIT

PURSUANT TO THE AGREEMENT, WHICH PROVIDES FOR STIPULATED MONETARY PENALTIES.

THE COMPANY MARKETS ITS

NEWLY REFORMULATED SCOTCHGARD PRODUCTS, WHICH REPLACE PREVIOUS VERSIONS,

PURSUANT TO A CONSENT AGREEMENT WITH THE EPA THAT REQUIRES EXTENSIVE HEALTH AND

ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS TESTING OF THE BASE CHEMISTRY UNDERLYING SUCH PRODUCTS, MOST

OF WHICH HAS BEEN COMPLETED. THE EPA HAS NOT YET ISSUED THE ANTICIPATED HAZARD

ASSESSMENT OF THAT HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS TESTING FOR THE

REFORMULATED SCOTCHGARD PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANY CANNOT

PREDICT WHAT REGULATORY ACTIONS ARISING FROM THE FOREGOING PROCEEDINGS AND

ACTIVITIES, IF ANY, MAY BE TAKEN REGARDING SUCH COMPOUNDS OR THE CONSEQUENCES

OF ANY SUCH ACTIONS.

LITIGATION

.

A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT INVOLVING PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY THAT

ORIGINALLY WAS FILED IN 2002 AGAINST THE COMPANY BY A FORMER EMPLOYEE IN THE

CIRCUIT COURT OF MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA, REMAINS PENDING. THE LAWSUIT SEEKS

UNSTATED COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND ALLEGES THAT THE PLAINTIFFS

SUFFERED FEAR, INCREASED RISK, AND SUB CLINICAL INJURIES FROM EXPOSURE TO

PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY AT OR NEAR THE COMPANYS DECATUR, ALABAMA,

MANUFACTURING FACILITY. THE COMPLAINT ALSO ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY ACTED

IMPROPERLY WITH RESPECT TO DISCLOSURES TO WORKERS CONCERNING SUCH CHEMISTRY.

THE COMPANY IS AWAITING A DECISION FROM THE COURT ON THE COMPANYS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE COMPLAINT THAT WAS HEARD ON DECEMBER 10, 2003. THE COMPANYS

SEPARATE MOTION TO DISMISS THE CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS IS ALSO PENDING. ON

SEPTEMBER 10, 2004, THREE RESIDENTS OF MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA, FILED A

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT INVOLVING PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY IN THE

CIRCUIT COURT OF MORGAN COUNTY. THE LAWSUIT SEEKS UNSTATED COMPENSATORY AND

PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND ALLEGES THAT THE PLAINTIFFS SUFFERED DAMAGE TO THEIR

PROPERTY FROM EMISSIONS OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS FROM THE COMPANYS

DECATUR, ALABAMA, MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT FORMERLY PRODUCED THOSE

COMPOUNDS. THE PURPORTED CLASS APPEARS TO BE INCLUDED IN THE PUTATIVE CLASS

ACTION DESCRIBED ABOVE. ON FEBRUARY 3, 2005, THE JUDGE GRANTED THE COMPANYS

MOTION TO ABATE THE CASE, EFFECTIVELY PUTTING THE CASE ON HOLD PENDING THE

OUTCOME OF THE CLASS CERTIFICATION DECISION IN THE ACTION DESCRIBED ABOVE FILED

IN THE SAME COURT IN 2002.

ON OCTOBER 8, 2004, TWO

RESIDENTS OF WASHINGTON COUNTY, MINNESOTA, FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION IN

THE DISTRICT COURT OF WASHINGTON COUNTY ON BEHALF OF WASHINGTON COUNTY

RESIDENTS WHOSE PROPERTY HAS ALLEGEDLY BEEN HARMED BY PERFLUOROOCTANYL

COMPOUNDS AND WHO HAVE ALLEGEDLY SUFFERED PERSONAL INJURY FROM SUCH COMPOUNDS

FROM THE COMPANYS COTTAGE GROVE, MINNESOTA, MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT

FORMERLY PRODUCED THOSE COMPOUNDS AND OTHER OF ITS FACILITIES NEARBY. THE

LAWSUIT SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $50,000 PER PLAINTIFF AND CLASS

MEMBER.

SEVERAL HUNDRED

PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO HAVE LIVED IN THE VICINITY OF THE ACME BARREL COMPANYS

STORAGE DRUM RECONDITIONING FACILITY IN CHICAGO, ILLINOIS, FILED A LAWSUIT IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS,

AGAINST 3M AND A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPANIES THAT ALLEGEDLY WERE CUSTOMERS OF

ACME BARREL. THE COMPLAINT SEEKS UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES AND

DEATH ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY THE PLAINTIFFS EXPOSURE TO CHEMICALS MIGRATING FROM

ACME BARRELS DRUM RECONDITIONING OPERATIONS. THE PLAINTIFFS ALSO ASSERT THAT A

CLASS SHOULD BE CERTIFIED ON BEHALF OF ALL PERSONS SIMILARLY SITUATED. A

SEPARATE WRONGFUL DEATH LAWSUIT WAS FILED IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY,

ILLINOIS, AGAINST 3M AND A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPANIES ON BEHALF OF THE ESTATE

AND FAMILY OF A PERSON WHO WORKED AT THE COOK COUNTY JUVENILE DETENTION CENTER

IN THE VICINITY OF THE ACME BARREL FACILITY. THE LAWSUIT ALLEGES UNSPECIFIED

DAMAGES FROM PERSONAL INJURIES AND DEATH ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO

CHEMICALS MIGRATING FROM ACME BARRELS DRUM RECONDITIONING OPERATIONS.

12

ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND

INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY COMPLIES WITH

THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES, AND RELATED GUIDANCE, AND RECORDS LIABILITIES

FOR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE IT CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE

AMOUNT OF THE LOSS AND WHERE LIABILITY IS PROBABLE. WHERE THE REASONABLE ESTIMATE

OF THE PROBABLE LOSS IS A RANGE, THE COMPANY RECORDS THE MOST LIKELY ESTIMATE

OF THE LOSS, OR THE LOW END OF THE RANGE IF THERE IS NO ONE BEST ESTIMATE. THE

COMPANY EITHER DISCLOSES THE AMOUNT OF A POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS IN

EXCESS OF ESTABLISHED RESERVES IF ESTIMABLE, OR STATES THAT SUCH AN ESTIMATE

CANNOT BE MADE. FOR THOSE INSURED MATTERS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN A

RESERVE, THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS RECEIVABLES FOR THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE THAT

IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER UNDER THE COMPANYS INSURANCE PROGRAM. FOR THOSE INSURED

MATTERS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS NOT TAKEN A RESERVE BECAUSE THE LIABILITY IS NOT

PROBABLE OR THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, BUT WHERE

THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED AN EXPENSE IN DEFENDING ITSELF, THE COMPANY RECORDS

RECEIVABLES FOR THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE THAT IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER FOR THE

EXPENSE INCURRED. THE COMPANY DISCLOSES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS EVEN

WHERE LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT

ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, IF THE COMPANY BELIEVES THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE

POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED.

BECAUSE LITIGATION IS

SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS OR DEVELOPMENTS

COULD OCCUR, THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT THE COMPANY MAY NOT ULTIMATELY

INCUR CHARGES IN EXCESS OF PRESENTLY RECORDED LIABILITIES. A FUTURE ADVERSE

RULING, SETTLEMENT, OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES

THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECORDED. THE COMPANY

CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT SUCH FUTURE CHARGES, IF ANY, WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY, TAKING

INTO ACCOUNT THE SIGNIFICANT AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR PRODUCTS

LIABILITY CLAIMS. BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND DEVELOPMENTS, THE COMPANY

PERIODICALLY REEXAMINES ITS ESTIMATES OF PROBABLE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED

EXPENSES AND RECEIVABLES, AND WHETHER IT IS ABLE TO ESTIMATE A LIABILITY

PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED TO BE NOT ESTIMABLE AND/OR NOT PROBABLE. WHERE

APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANY MAKES ADDITIONS TO OR ADJUSTMENTS OF ITS ESTIMATED

LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, THE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS

FOR THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY COULD CHANGE

IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES

INSURANCE RECEIVABLES BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ITS NUMEROUS POLICIES, INCLUDING

THEIR EXCLUSIONS, PERTINENT CASE LAW INTERPRETING COMPARABLE POLICIES, ITS

EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR CLAIMS, AND ASSESSMENT OF THE NATURE OF THE CLAIM, AND

RECORDS AN AMOUNT IT HAS CONCLUDED IS LIKELY TO BE RECOVERED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS

THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF CLAIMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE

ITS PROBABLE LIABILITY AND FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN RESERVES AND THE

RANGE OF LOSS AT THIS TIME.  THE AMOUNTS

IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WITH RESPECT TO BREAST IMPLANT AND ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION REPRESENT THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE RESPECTIVE LIABILITIES.

BREAST

IMPLANT INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE

COMPANY HAD RECEIVABLES FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO THE BREAST IMPLANT

MATTER OF $278 MILLION, REPRESENTING AMOUNTS COVERED BY THE MINNESOTA SUPREME

COURTS RULING OF AUGUST, 2003, AGAINST THE INSURERS BUT YET TO BE RECEIVED

(APPROXIMATELY $215 MILLION) AND OTHER AMOUNTS THAT HAVE BEEN CLAIMED FROM

VARIOUS REINSURERS, THE MINNESOTA INSURANCE GUARANTY ASSOCIATION, AND THE

ESTATES OF CERTAIN INSOLVENT INSURANCE CARRIERS. THE COMPANY RECEIVED ABOUT $50

MILLION IN 2004, OFFSETTING A PORTION OF THE PREVIOUSLY RECORDED RECEIVABLE,

PURSUANT TO SETTLEMENTS WITH SIX INSURERS AND ONE REINSURER THAT WERE

CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS OVERALL EXPECTATION OF RECOVERY AS A RESULT OF

THE MINNESOTA

13

SUPREME COURT RULING.

VARIOUS FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF PROCEEDS TO BE RECEIVED

UNDER THE BALANCE OF THE COMPANYS VARIOUS INSURANCE POLICIES, INCLUDING (I)

ADDITIONAL DELAYS IN OR AVOIDANCE OF PAYMENT BY INSURERS; (II) THE EXTENT TO

WHICH INSURERS MAY BECOME INSOLVENT IN THE FUTURE, AND (III) THE OUTCOME OF THE

PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE INSURERS, INCLUDING THE INSURERS

PENDING MOTION FOR PARTIAL RELIEF FROM THE AMOUNT THE COMPANY BELIEVES IS DUE

UNDER THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT DECISION.

RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

THE

COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES, BOTH THE COST TO

RESOLVE THE CLAIM AND DEFENSE COSTS, BY EXAMINING: (I) THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE

IN RESOLVING CLAIMS, (II) APPARENT TRENDS, (III) THE APPARENT QUALITY OF

NEWLY-FILED CLAIMS (E.G., THE COMPANY BELIEVES MANY OF THE RECENTLY FILED

CLAIMS HAVE BEEN ASSERTED ON BEHALF OF ASYMPTOMATIC CLAIMANTS), (IV) CHANGES IN

THE NATURE AND MIX OF CLAIMS (E.G., THE PROPORTION OF CLAIMS ASSERTING USAGE OF

THE COMPANYS MASK OR RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND ALLEGING EXPOSURE TO EACH OF

ASBESTOS, SILICA OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS, AND CLAIMS PLEADING USE OF

ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCTS ALLEGEDLY MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY), (V) THE

NUMBER OF CURRENT CLAIMS AND AN ASSUMPTION FOR PROJECTION OF THE NUMBER OF

FUTURE ASBESTOS AND OTHER CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY, (VI)

THE COST TO RESOLVE RECENTLY SETTLED CLAIMS, AND (VII) AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST

TO RESOLVE AND DEFEND AGAINST CURRENT AND FUTURE CLAIMS. BECAUSE OF THE

INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN PROJECTING CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ASSERTED,

PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS RESPIRATORY PRODUCTS THAT THEMSELVES

DID NOT CONTAIN ANY HARMFUL MATERIALS (WHICH MAKES THE VARIOUS PUBLISHED

STUDIES THAT PURPORT TO PROJECT FUTURE ASBESTOS CLAIMS SUBSTANTIALLY REMOVED

FROM THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXPERIENCE AND WHICH THEMSELVES VARY WIDELY), THE

COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY SINGLE BEST ESTIMATE OF THIS

LIABILITY, NOR THAT IT CAN RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OR RANGE OF AMOUNTS BY

WHICH THE LIABILITY MAY EXCEED THE RESERVE THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED.

DEVELOPMENTS MAY OCCUR

THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ITS LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED

EXPENSES. THESE DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES IN (I) THE NUMBER OF FUTURE CLAIMS, (II) THE AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING

CLAIMS, (III) THE LEGAL COSTS OF DEFENDING THESE CLAIMS AND IN MAINTAINING

TRIAL READINESS, (IV) CHANGES IN THE MIX AND NATURE OF CLAIMS RECEIVED, (V)

TRIAL AND APPELLATE OUTCOMES, (VI) CHANGES IN THE LAW AND PROCEDURE APPLICABLE

TO THESE CLAIMS, AND (VII) THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER CO-DEFENDANTS AND

INSURERS. CONGRESS IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING LEGISLATION THAT WOULD TERMINATE

ESSENTIALLY ALL LITIGATION RELATED TO ASBESTOS (BUT NOT OTHER OCCUPATIONAL

DUSTS) IN EXCHANGE FOR SUBSTANTIAL ANNUAL PAYMENTS BY THE DEFENDANT COMPANIES

AND THEIR INSURERS AND, ACCORDINGLY, SUCH LEGISLATION, IF ENACTED, WOULD BRING

CONSIDERABLE CERTAINTY TO THE ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS FUTURE

ASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITY; THE COMPANY SUPPORTS SUCH LEGISLATION IN PRINCIPLE,

ALTHOUGH ENACTMENT OF THE PROPOSED LEGISLATION COULD CAUSE THE COMPANY TO

RECORD SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL LIABILITIES.

AS A RESULT OF THE

CASELOAD AND THE COSTS OF AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDING ITSELF, THE COMPANY MADE

PAYMENTS OF $81 MILLION IN 2004 AND INCREASED ITS RESERVES IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2004 FOR THE RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES BY $40 MILLION TO

$248 MILLION. NO LIABILITY HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY RECORDED REGARDING THE

NOW-REVERSED MISSISSIPPI JURY VERDICT AND NO LIABILITY HAS BEEN RECORDED

REGARDING THE PENDING ACTION BROUGHT BY THE WEST VIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL

PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004,

THE COMPANY HAD RECEIVABLES FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO THE RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION OF $464 MILLION. THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS RECEIVABLES

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION BY $20 MILLION AND RECEIVED PAYMENTS FROM INSURERS AND

ONE REINSURER OF $4 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004. WHILE THE COMPANY HAS

SUBSTANTIAL REMAINING CLAIMS-MADE AND OCCURRENCE (PRE-1986) INSURANCE COVERAGE,

AS PREVIOUSLY NOTED, THIS ADDITIONAL RECEIVABLE REPRESENTS A LOWER PERCENTAGE

OF THE ADDITIONAL LIABILITY THAN WAS THE CASE WITH RECEIVABLES RECORDED PRIOR

TO 2004, PRIMARILY BECAUSE OF VARYING DEGREES OF PRIOR SETTLEMENTS AT HIGHER

LEVELS OF THE COMPANYS INSURANCE COVERAGE, INSOLVENCIES OF CERTAIN INSURERS,

UNCERTAINTIES CONCERNING THE PRECISE MANNER OF ASSIGNING PARTICULAR COSTS TO

SPECIFIC POLICIES, AND THE TYPES OF CLAIMS ASSERTED. VARIOUS FACTORS COULD

AFFECT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF PROCEEDS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE COMPANYS

VARIOUS INSURANCE POLICIES, INCLUDING (I) DELAYS IN OR AVOIDANCE OF PAYMENT BY INSURERS;

(II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH INSURERS MAY BECOME INSOLVENT IN THE FUTURE, AND (III)

THE OUTCOME OF POSSIBLE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE ACCRUED LIABILITY AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLE REPRESENTS THE TIME DELAY

BETWEEN PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND RECEIPT OF INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENTS. BECAUSE OF

THE LAG TIME BETWEEN SETTLEMENT AND PAYMENT OF A CLAIM, NO MEANINGFUL

CONCLUSIONS MAY BE DRAWN FROM QUARTERLY CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES

FOR EXPECTED INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND THE QUARTERLY CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF

CLAIMANTS AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER.

ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD RECORDED LIABILITIES OF $39 MILLION FOR

ESTIMATED ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS BASED UPON AN EVALUATION OF CURRENTLY

AVAILABLE FACTS WITH RESPECT TO EACH INDIVIDUAL SITE AND ALSO RECORDED RELATED

INSURANCE RECEIVABLES OF $16 MILLION. THE COMPANY RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR

REMEDIATION COSTS ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE

14

PROBABLE AND REASONABLY

ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES OR THE

COMPANYS COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION. LIABILITIES FOR ESTIMATED COSTS OF

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, DEPENDING ON THE SITE, ARE BASED PRIMARILY UPON

INTERNAL OR THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, AND ESTIMATES AS TO THE NUMBER,

PARTICIPATION LEVEL AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF ANY OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE

PARTIES, THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION AND THE NATURE OF REQUIRED REMEDIAL

ACTIONS. THE COMPANY ADJUSTS RECORDED LIABILITIES AS FURTHER INFORMATION

DEVELOPS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT IT WILL PAY THE

AMOUNTS RECORDED OVER THE PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE APPLICABLE SITES,

CURRENTLY RANGING UP TO 30 YEARS. AMOUNTS EXPENSED FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

ACTIVITIES WERE NOT MATERIAL AT THESE LOCATIONS, NOR HAVE THERE BEEN MATERIAL

CHANGES IN THE RECORDED LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO

ESTIMATE THE COST OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND REMEDIATION GIVEN THE

UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF APPLICABLE

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE EXTENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION

AND THE EXISTENCE OF ALTERNATE CLEANUP METHODS. DEVELOPMENTS MAY OCCUR THAT

COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS CURRENT ASSESSMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO.

(I) CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS; (II) CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL

REGULATIONS OR ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, INCLUDING EFFORTS TO RECOVER NATURAL

RESOURCE DAMAGES; (III) NEW AND EVOLVING ANALYTICAL AND REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES;

(IV) SUCCESS IN ALLOCATING LIABILITY TO OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES;

AND (V) THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND

THIRD-PARTY INDEMNITORS.

ITEM 7.

MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

OVERVIEW

3M IS A DIVERSIFIED

GLOBAL MANUFACTURER, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATOR AND MARKETER OF A WIDE VARIETY OF

PRODUCTS. 3M MANAGES ITS OPERATIONS IN SEVEN OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

HEALTH CARE; INDUSTRIAL; DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS; CONSUMER AND OFFICE; SAFETY,

SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS; AND TRANSPORTATION.

3MS PERFORMANCE IN 2004 WAS BROAD-BASED, WITH STRONG PERFORMANCE AND GROWTH IN

DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS, BUT 3M ALSO HAD SUCCESS IN ESTABLISHED BUSINESSES LIKE

INDUSTRIAL; SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; AND CONSUMER AND OFFICE.

ALL SEVEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS CONTRIBUTED TO SALES GROWTH IN 2004. IN 2004, 3M

REPORTED RECORD NET SALES OF $20.011 BILLION AND RECORD NET INCOME OF $2.990

BILLION, OR $3.75 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED WITH NET SALES OF $18.232 BILLION

AND NET INCOME OF $2.403 BILLION, OR $3.02 PER DILUTED SHARE, IN 2003. THE

COMBINATION OF A 9.8% INCREASE IN NET SALES, INCLUDING CORE VOLUME SALES GROWTH

OF 6.2% (WHICH EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN THE LAST 12

MONTHS), AND DECLINING OPERATING EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF SALES, RESULTED IN A

22.9% OPERATING INCOME PROFIT MARGIN. THE FOLLOWING TABLE CONTAINS SALES AND

SALES GROWTH IN 2004 WAS

STRONGEST IN THE DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT, DRIVEN BY SALES OF DISPLAY

ENHANCEMENT FILMS USED IN FLAT-PANEL DEVICES, AND THE INDUSTRIAL SEGMENT, LED

BY BROAD-BASED SALES ACROSS INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIES. SALES GROWTH

IN THE SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES SEGMENT WAS DRIVEN BY CONTINUED

DEMAND FOR PERSONAL PROTECTION PRODUCTS ALONG WITH STRONG DEMAND FOR CLEANING AND

PROTECTION PRODUCTS. SALES GROWTH IN THE CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENT WAS

BROAD-BASED, WITH THE TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT LED BY BOTH THE AUTOMOTIVE OEM AND

REPAIR MARKETS. THE HEALTH CARE SEGMENT EXPERIENCED TOUGH YEAR-ON-YEAR

COMPARISONS THROUGH THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF THE YEAR, WITH IMPROVEMENT IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004. FOR THE ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT, THIS

WAS THE FIRST YEAR OF POSITIVE SALES GROWTH SINCE 2000. REFER TO THE

PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT SECTION FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE

RESULTS OF THE RESPECTIVE SEGMENTS.

ASIA PACIFIC

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES (WHICH EXCLUDES TRANSLATION IMPACTS) INCREASED 13.6%, WITH

THE STRONGEST GROWTH IN CHINA, KOREA AND TAIWAN. ALL SEVEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS

CONTRIBUTED TO THIS INCREASE. U.S. SALES REVENUE INCREASED 3.9%, WITH GROWTH

LED BY CONSUMER AND OFFICE; SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; AND THE

INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. EUROPEAN LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 0.8%, WITH

GROWTH IN SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; TRANSPORTATION; INDUSTRIAL;

AND HEALTH CARE. IN THE COMBINED LATIN AMERICA, AFRICA AND CANADA AREA, SIX OF

SEVEN BUSINESSES HAD LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASES, LED BY ELECTRO AND

COMMUNICATIONS; TRANSPORTATION; INDUSTRIAL; AND HEALTH CARE. FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION POSITIVELY IMPACTED EUROPEAN SALES BY 8.9%, ASIA PACIFIC SALES BY

5.6%, AND THE COMBINED LATIN AMERICA, AFRICA AND CANADA AREA BY 2.4%, AS THE

U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENED AGAINST THESE CURRENCIES. REFER TO THE PERFORMANCE BY

GEOGRAPHIC AREA SECTION FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS FOR THE

RESPECTIVE AREAS.

OPERATING INCOME IN 2004

INCREASED BY 23.3% VERSUS 2003, AS ALL SEVEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS POSTED

INCREASES. THE COMBINATION OF SOLID SALES GROWTH AND POSITIVE BENEFITS FROM

3MS 2004 CORPORATE INITIATIVES DROVE THE OPERATING INCOME INCREASE. COST

REDUCTION PROJECTS RELATED TO THESE INITIATIVES  SIX SIGMA, GLOBAL SOURCING

EFFECTIVENESS, 3M ACCELERATION AND EPRODUCTIVITY  CONTRIBUTED OVER $400

MILLION IN AGGREGATE OPERATING INCOME BENEFITS IN 2004 (SEE NOTE A AT THE END

OF THIS OVERVIEW SECTION). CURRENCY IMPACTS, RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE WEAKER

U.S. DOLLAR, BOOSTED 2004 OPERATING INCOME BY AN ESTIMATED $286 MILLION,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED

18

PENSION EXPENSE OF $157

MILLION. OPERATING INCOME IN 2003 WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A $93 MILLION

PRE-TAX CHARGE RELATED TO AN ADVERSE RULING IN A LAWSUIT FILED AGAINST 3M IN

1997 BY LEPAGES INC.

3M GENERATED $4.282

BILLION OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN 2004, A $509 MILLION INCREASE OVER 2003, AND

ENDED THE YEAR WITH $2.757 BILLION OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS. CASH FLOW IN

2004 WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY HIGHER NET INCOME. IN 2004, THE COMPANY UTILIZED

$2.916 BILLION OF CASH TO REPURCHASE 3M COMMON STOCK AND PAY DIVIDENDS, AND

CONTRIBUTED $591 MILLION TO ITS PENSION PLANS. 3MS DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO

(TOTAL CAPITAL DEFINED AS DEBT PLUS EQUITY) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS

APPROXIMATELY 21%. 3M HAS AN AA CREDIT RATING FROM STANDARD & POORS AND AN

AA1 CREDIT RATING FROM MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE.

IN 2005, 3M EXPECTS TO

CONTINUE ITS MOMENTUM TO DRIVE SALES, OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND CASH FLOW

GROWTH. 3M IS LOOKING FOR CONTINUED BROAD-BASED PRODUCT SALES TO DRIVE ITS

GROWTH, IN ADDITION TO EXPECTED CONTINUED GROWTH IN OPTICAL FILM PRODUCTS, AND

WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO ASSESS POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS. CONTINUED CORE VOLUME

SALES GROWTH WILL REQUIRE BOTH FASTER GROWTH OF EXISTING PRODUCTS/SERVICES AND

SUCCESSFUL INTRODUCTION OF NEW PRODUCTS. WHILE INTERNATIONAL SALES NOW

REPRESENT 61% OF WORLDWIDE SALES, THE COMPANY WILL ALSO FOCUS ON EXECUTION OF

SALES AND GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES IN THE UNITED STATES. IN PART TO ENERGIZE THE 3M

ACCELERATION INITIATIVE, EARLY IN 2004 THE COMPANY LAUNCHED AN EXTENSIVE EFFORT

TO RECONNECT AND RE-ENGAGE WITH CUSTOMERS. THIS WILL AID 3M IN ITS CONTINUING

QUEST TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL CUSTOMER VALUE, WITH BOTH THE CUSTOMER AND 3M

BENEFITING THROUGH VALUE CREATION AND ALSO FACILITATING 3MS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE

APPROPRIATE PRICING. THE COMPANY ALSO IS FOCUSED ON ITS CORPORATE INITIATIVES

TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCE COSTS. COST REDUCTION PROJECTS RELATED TO

THESE INITIATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO CONTRIBUTE AN ADDITIONAL $400 MILLION TO

OPERATING INCOME IN 2005. THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED BOTH PRICE INCREASES AND

SUPPLY LIMITATIONS AFFECTING SEVERAL OIL-DERIVED RAW MATERIALS, BUT TO DATE THE

COMPANY IS RECEIVING SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF SUCH MATERIALS TO MEET ITS

REASONABLY FORESEEABLE PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS. FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES ALSO IMPACT RESULTS, ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY MINIMIZES THIS EFFECT

THROUGH HEDGING ABOUT HALF OF THIS IMPACT. 3M WILL ALSO CONTINUE, AS IT HAS FOR

MANY YEARS, TO INCUR EXPENSES (INSURED AND UNINSURED) IN MANAGING ITS

LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES. THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY

FROM THOSE PROJECTED (REFER TO THE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS DISCUSSION LATER

IN ITEM 7 FOR DISCUSSION OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES).

(NOTE A). THE COMPANYS

FIVE CORPORATE INITIATIVES (SIX SIGMA, GLOBAL SOURCING EFFECTIVENESS, 3M

ACCELERATION, EPRODUCTIVITY AND GLOBAL BUSINESS PROCESSES) ARE AIMED AT

ACCELERATING LONG-TERM TOP-LINE GROWTH, IMPROVING CASH FLOW AND LOWERING ITS

TOTAL COST STRUCTURE. INDIRECT COST CONTROL, WHICH FOCUSED ON REDUCING COSTS

NOT DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, IS NO LONGER A FORMAL

INITIATIVE AND IS NOW MANAGED USING A PRODUCTIVITY METRIC. SIX SIGMA FOCUSES ON

HIGHER GROWTH, PRODUCTIVITY AND CASH FLOW. GLOBAL SOURCING EFFECTIVENESS

GENERATES SAVINGS BY LEVERAGING PURCHASING ECONOMIES OF SCALE, ENCOURAGING

COMPETITION AMONG SUPPLIERS, GEOGRAPHIC BROADENING AND E-APPLICATIONS. THROUGH

ITS 3M ACCELERATION INITIATIVE, THE COMPANY IS DRIVING TOWARD MORE AND BETTER

NEW PRODUCT IDEAS AND FASTER, MORE IMPACTFUL NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS, ALONG

WITH REALLOCATING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO LARGER, MORE GLOBAL

PROJECTS. IN EPRODUCTIVITY, 3M BELIEVES IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO

IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY FOR ITS CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND FOR 3M ITSELF. 3MS

GLOBAL BUSINESS PROCESSES INITIATIVE CONTINUES 3MS ONGOING EFFORT TO

STANDARDIZE, SIMPLIFY AND STRENGTHEN ITS BUSINESS PROCESSES IN ORDER TO

INCREASE THE SPEED, EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY OF SERVICE FUNCTIONS VITAL TO ITS

BUSINESS OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ALL OF THE

ESTIMATED COST SAVINGS FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES WILL BE REALIZED. NUMEROUS FACTORS

MAY CREATE OFFSETS TO THESE SAVINGS, SUCH AS THE POTENTIAL FOR WEAKNESS IN

SALES VOLUMES, NORMAL INCREASES IN COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, AND OTHER

INFLATIONARY PRESSURES. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT COST REDUCTION PROJECTS

RELATED TO INITIATIVES PROVIDED A COMBINED INCREMENTAL BENEFIT TO OPERATING

INCOME OF MORE THAN $400 MILLION IN 2004, AFTER CONTRIBUTING A SIMILAR AMOUNT

IN 2003. THESE INITIATIVES PROVIDED AN INCREMENTAL BENEFIT TO OPERATING INCOME

OF MORE THAN $500 MILLION IN 2002.

2004, CORE VOLUME GROWTH (WHICH EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN

THE LAST 12 MONTHS) WAS BROAD-BASED, WITH ALL SEVEN BUSINESSES POSTING

WORLDWIDE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH. LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH WAS LED BY DISPLAY

AND GRAPHICS; INDUSTRIAL; CONSUMER AND OFFICE; SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION

SERVICES; AND THE TRANSPORTATION BUSINESSES. HEALTH CARE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES

INCREASED 1.7%, AS RESULTS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY 2003 SALES FROM

PHARMACEUTICAL AND DRUG DELIVERY AGREEMENTS THAT DID NOT REPEAT IN 2004.

ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 0.3%, THE FIRST YEAR

OF POSITIVE GROWTH SINCE 2000. ACQUISITIONS INCREASED 2004 SALES BY 0.5%,

DRIVEN BY THE 2004 ACQUISITIONS OF HIGHJUMP SOFTWARE, INC. AND HORNELL HOLDING

AB. INTERNATIONALLY, SELLING PRICES DECLINED 1.1%, WITH MOST OF THE DECLINE

COMING IN CERTAIN BUSINESSES THAT SERVE THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY, WHERE IT IS

IMPORTANT TO LOOK AT THE COMBINED IMPACT OF VOLUME AND PRICE. ON A GEOGRAPHIC

BASIS, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH IN 2004 WAS LED BY THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA.

REFER TO BOTH THE PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT AND PERFORMANCE BY

GEOGRAPHIC AREA SECTIONS FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF SALES CHANGE.

IN

2003, CORE VOLUME GROWTH (WHICH EXCLUDES THE IMPACT OF BUSINESSES ACQUIRED IN

THE LAST 12 MONTHS) WAS LED BY DISPLAY ENHANCEMENT FILMS, BROAD-BASED GROWTH IN

MOST OF THE HEALTH CARE BUSINESSES, PERSONAL PROTECTION PRODUCTS, AND GROWTH IN

PRODUCTS RELATED TO CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT/HOME CARE. ACQUISITIONS

INCREASED 2003 SALES BY NEARLY 2%, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY THE DECEMBER 2002

ACQUISITION OF CORNING PRECISION LENS, INC. ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS, 2003 CORE

VOLUME GROWTH WAS STRONGEST IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA.

COST OF SALES.

COST OF SALES INCLUDES

MANUFACTURING, ENGINEERING AND FREIGHT COSTS. COST OF SALES DECREASED 1.1

PERCENTAGE POINTS IN BOTH 2004 AND 2003. THE 2004 DECREASE AS A PERCENT OF NET

SALES WAS DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF HIGHER VOLUMES, PRODUCTIVITY GAINS,

ONGOING BENEFITS OF CORPORATE INITIATIVES AND POSITIVE CURRENCY IMPACTS

(INCLUDING HEDGING IMPACTS). WHILE 3M RAW MATERIAL COSTS INCREASED DURING THE

YEAR, 3MS GLOBAL SOURCING INITIATIVE WAS IMPORTANT IN ENABLING 3M TO MINIMIZE

RAW MATERIAL COST INCREASES DURING A PERIOD OF COMMODITY PRICE INFLATION.

COST OF SALES IN 2003

BENEFITED FROM SIX SIGMA AND OTHER PROJECTS AIMED AT IMPROVING MANUFACTURING

THROUGHPUT, YIELD AND PRODUCTIVITY. 3MS GLOBAL SOURCING INITIATIVE HAS HELPED

MITIGATE THE IMPACT OF RAW MATERIAL PRICE INCREASES. IN 2003, RAW MATERIAL

COSTS WERE ESSENTIALLY FLAT VERSUS 2002. CHARGES RELATED TO THE 2001/2002

CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM NEGATIVELY IMPACTED COST OF SALES BY 0.7

PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2002.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) EXPENSES HAVE IMPROVED BY 0.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN

EACH OF THE PAST TWO YEARS. THE IMPROVEMENT IN 2004 AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES

WAS HELPED BY LEVERAGE RELATED TO 3MS STRONG GROWTH IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA.

SG&A EXPENSES IN U.S. DOLLARS INCREASED IN 2004, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY

CURRENCY TRANSLATION AND INCREASED ADVERTISING AND MERCHANDISING SPENDING TO

SUPPORT 3MS STRONG BRAND PORTFOLIO. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, THE COMPANY IS

SHIFTING SG&A DOLLARS TOWARD FASTER-GROWTH BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.

SG&A EXPENSES IN U.S.

DOLLARS IN 2003 INCREASED DUE TO CURRENCY TRANSLATION, AS WELL AS HIGHER

ADVERTISING AND MERCHANDISING SPENDING. CHARGES RELATED TO THE 2001/2002

CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SG&A IN 2002 BY

$77 MILLION, OR 0.5% OF SALES. EXCLUDING THESE CHARGES, SG&A FOR 2003

WAS RELATIVELY FLAT AS A PERCENT OF SALES COMPARED WITH 2002.

OTHER EXPENSE.

IN 2003, 3M RECORDED PRE-TAX CHARGES OF $93 MILLION ($58 MILLION

AFTER-TAX, OR 7 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) RELATED TO AN ADVERSE RULING IN A LAWSUIT

FILED AGAINST 3M IN 1997 BY LEPAGES INC. THE PRE-TAX CHARGE OF $93 MILLION IS

CLASSIFIED AS OTHER EXPENSE WITHIN OPERATING INCOME. FOR MORE DETAIL, REFER

TO THE DISCUSSION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS DOCUMENT.

2001/2002 CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM.

IN 2002, CHARGES RELATED TO THE 2001/2002 CORPORATE

RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM REDUCED OPERATING INCOME BY $202 MILLION AND NET INCOME

BY $108 MILLION. THESE CHARGES PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND

BENEFIT COSTS, ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION CHARGES, AND OTHER ASSOCIATED EXIT

COSTS UNDER THE COMPANYS RESTRUCTURING PLAN ANNOUNCED IN JUNE 2001. THESE

CHARGES ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES ($121 MILLION); SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ($77 MILLION); AND RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED

EXPENSES ($4 MILLION). THE 2001/2002

CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM ACTIONS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED BY JUNE

30, 2002. THE COMPANY ESTIMATED INCREMENTAL SAVINGS UNDER THIS PLAN OF

APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION ON A PRE-TAX BASIS IN 2003, PRIMARILY IN THE FIRST

HALF OF THE YEAR. THE COMPANY ESTIMATED INCREMENTAL SAVINGS OF $300 MILLION ON

A PRE-TAX BASIS IN 2002. THE MAJORITY OF THESE SAVINGS WERE FROM REDUCED

EMPLOYEE COSTS. FOR MORE DETAIL, REFER TO THE DISCUSSION IN NOTE 4 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (2001/2002 CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM).

OPERATING INCOME.

3M USES OPERATING INCOME

AS ONE OF ITS PRIMARY BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TOOLS. OPERATING

INCOME IN 2004 WAS 22.9% OF SALES, UP FROM 20.4% OF SALES IN 2003 AND 18.7% OF

SALES IN 2002. OPERATING INCOME IN 2004 GREW BY $865 MILLION, OR 23.3 PERCENT,

FOLLOWING 2003 OPERATING INCOME GROWTH OF $667 MILLION, OR 21.9%. THE LEPAGES

INC. LAWSUIT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING INCOME IN 2003 BY $93 MILLION, OR

0.5% OF SALES. THE 2001/2002 CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED OPERATING INCOME IN 2002 BY $202 MILLION, OR 1.2% OF SALES.

INTEREST

EXPENSE

: THE DECREASE IN 2004 INTEREST EXPENSE WAS PRIMARILY

THE RESULT OF LOWER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST

RATES IN THE UNITED STATES. THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN 2003 INTEREST EXPENSE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO A REDUCED BENEFIT FROM CAPITALIZED INTEREST (RELATED TO LOWER

CAPITAL SPENDING) AND HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT BALANCES, LARGELY OFFSET BY LOWER

INTEREST RATES.

INTEREST

INTEREST INCOME INCREASED IN 2004 DUE TO

2004 RELATED PRIMARILY TO HIGHER NET INCOME IN SUMITOMO 3M, AS 3M ELIMINATES

THE NON-3M OWNERSHIP PORTION OF NET INCOME. THE DECREASE IN 2003 RELATED TO

3MS PURCHASE OF THE MINORITY INTEREST SHARES OF 3M INTER-UNITEK GMBH IN

DECEMBER 2002 AND THE PURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL 25% OWNERSHIP IN SUMITOMO 3M IN

EARLY 2003. REFER TO NOTE 2 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE ACQUISITIONS.

CURRENCY EFFECTS.

3M ESTIMATES THAT

YEAR-ON-YEAR CURRENCY EFFECTS, INCLUDING HEDGING IMPACTS, INCREASED NET INCOME

BY $181 MILLION IN 2004 AND $73 MILLION IN 2003, AND REDUCED NET INCOME BY $35

MILLION IN 2002. THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF TRANSLATING PROFITS FROM

LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS; THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE

TRANSFER OF GOODS BETWEEN 3M OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD; AND

TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED TO

THE HEALTH CARE SEGMENT

SERVES MARKETS THAT INCLUDE MEDICAL, SURGICAL, PHARMACEUTICAL, DENTAL AND

ORTHODONTIC, HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS AND PERSONAL CARE. PRODUCTS PROVIDED TO

THESE MARKETS INCLUDE MEDICAL AND SURGICAL SUPPLIES, SKIN HEALTH AND INFECTION

PREVENTION PRODUCTS, PHARMACEUTICALS, DRUG DELIVERY SYSTEMS, DENTAL AND

ORTHODONTIC PRODUCTS, HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS, MICROBIOLOGY PRODUCTS, AND

CLOSURES FOR DISPOSABLE DIAPERS.

IN

2004, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES IN HEALTH CARE INCREASED 1.7%, WITH THE FIRST NINE

MONTHS OF 2004 NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY 2003 PHARMACEUTICAL AND DRUG DELIVERY

AGREEMENTS THAT DID NOT REPEAT. FOURTH QUARTER 2004 LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GREW

5.0%, AS YEAR-ON-YEAR COMPARISONS BECAME MORE FAVORABLE. OPERATING INCOME

INCREASED 9.3% TO $1.123 BILLION IN 2004.

THE 3M PRODUCT PLATFORM

OF IMMUNE RESPONSE MODIFIERS (IRMS) CONTINUES TO PROGRESS. 3M RECEIVED U.S.

FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION (FDA) APPROVAL IN MARCH 2004 TO MARKET ALDARA

(IMIQUIMOD) CREAM, 5%, FOR THE TREATMENT OF CERTAIN TYPES OF ACTINIC KERATOSIS

(A PRE-CANCEROUS SKIN CONDITION). IN JULY 2004, THE FDA GRANTED APPROVAL FOR

ALDARA FOR THE TREATMENT OF SUPERFICIAL BASAL CELL CARCINOMA (A COMMON FORM OF

NON-MELANOMA SKIN CANCER). THE PATENT AND RELATED RIGHTS FOR THE IMIQUIMOD

MOLECULE ARE IMPORTANT TO THE HEALTH CARE BUSINESS. THE ORIGINAL PATENT ON THE

IMIQUIMOD MOLECULE EXPIRED IN AUGUST 2004, BUT THE PATENT TERM EXTENSION RUNS THROUGH

AUGUST 2009.

IN THE PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS, AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED WITH ELI LILLY AND COMPANY IN SEPTEMBER OF

2001 TO COLLABORATE ON RESIQUIMOD, AN INVESTIGATIONAL COMPOUND FOR THE

TREATMENT OF GENITAL HERPES. 3M RECEIVED $100 MILLION IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2001 FROM LILLY IN CONSIDERATION FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EFFORTS. REVENUE WAS RECOGNIZED ON A PRO-RATA BASIS OVER THE SERVICE PERIOD. 3M

RECOGNIZED $44 MILLION OF REVENUE RELATING TO THIS AGREEMENT IN 2003, $43

MILLION IN 2002 AND $7 MILLION IN 2001. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, 3M AND

ELI LILLY REACHED A FINAL AGREEMENT TO RETURN CONTROL OF RESIQUIMOD TO 3M. UPON

TERMINATION OF THE AGREEMENT IN 2003, 3M RECOGNIZED THE MAJORITY OF THE

REMAINING REVENUE (WITH DEFERRAL OF SOME IMMATERIAL REMAINING OBLIGATIONS UNTIL

2004 WHEN THE OBLIGATIONS WERE FINALIZED).

IN OCTOBER 2003, IVAX

CORPORATION AGREED TO ASSUME EXCLUSIVE RIGHTS TO 3MS BRANDED HEALTH CARE

RESPIRATORY PRODUCTS, TOGETHER WITH RELATED MARKETING AND SALES PERSONNEL, IN

NINE EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. THE AGREEMENT COVERED QVAR (BECLOMETHASONE

DIPROPIONATE HFA) INHALATION AEROSOL, A MAINTENANCE MEDICATION USED TO

PREVENT ASTHMA ATTACKS, AND ALSO COVERED AIROMIR (ALBUTEROL SULFATE) INHALER,

A RESCUE MEDICATION USED TO RELIEVE ACUTE ASTHMA SYMPTOMS. 3M WILL CONTINUE

TO MANUFACTURE AND SUPPLY THESE PRODUCTS TO IVAX. THE TOTAL CONSIDERATION DUE

UNDER THE AGREEMENT, INCLUDING MINIMUM ANNUAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS, WAS $77

MILLION, OF WHICH $26 MILLION WAS PAID IN 2003 AND $24 MILLION WAS PAID IN

2004. 3M EXPECTS TO RECEIVE $24 MILLION IN 2005 AND $3 MILLION IN 2006. 3M

MAY ALSO RECEIVE ADDITIONAL ROYALTY PAYMENTS (UP TO A MAXIMUM OF APPROXIMATELY

$7 MILLION IN TOTAL) IF IVAX ACHIEVES CERTAIN ANNUAL SALES LEVELS. THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZES THE ROYALTY REVENUE RELATED TO THE IVAX AGREEMENT RATABLY OVER THE

TERM OF THE LICENSING ARRANGEMENT.

IN 2003, LOCAL-CURRENCY

GROWTH AND TOTAL SALES GROWTH IN THE HEALTH CARE SEGMENT WAS BROAD-BASED.

GEOGRAPHIC AREA LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH WAS LED BY THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA AND THE

LATIN AMERICA, AFRICA AND CANADA AREA, WITH THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE

SHOWING MODERATE GROWTH. OPERATING INCOME IMPROVEMENT WAS ALSO BROAD-BASED. IN

2003, THE COMBINED BENEFIT FROM BOTH THE ELI LILLY AGREEMENT AND THE IVAX

CORPORATION AGREEMENT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SEPARATION COSTS IN HEALTH CARE,

RESULTING IN A NET BENEFIT TO OPERATING INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY

$20 MILLION.

SUPPLY CHAIN EXECUTION SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS.

INDUSTRIAL LOCAL-CURRENCY

SALES GROWTH OF 9.1% FOR THE YEAR WAS BROAD-BASED ACROSS MAJOR GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

SEGMENT SERVES MARKETS THAT INCLUDE ELECTRONIC DISPLAY, TOUCH SCREEN, TRAFFIC

SAFETY AND COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS. THIS SEGMENT INCLUDES OPTICAL FILM AND LENS

SOLUTIONS FOR ELECTRONIC DISPLAYS; TOUCH SCREENS AND TOUCH MONITORS; REFLECTIVE

SHEETING FOR TRANSPORTATION SAFETY; AND COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS SYSTEMS. THE

OPTICAL BUSINESS INCLUDES A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT PRODUCTS THAT ARE PROTECTED BY

VARIOUS PATENTS AND GROUPS OF PATENTS. THE REMAINING LIFETIMES OF SUCH PATENTS

RANGE FROM ONE TO GREATER THAN 15 YEARS. THESE PATENTS PROVIDE VARYING MEASURES

OF EXCLUSIVITY TO 3M FOR A NUMBER OF SUCH PRODUCTS. 3MS PROPRIETARY

MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY AND KNOW-HOW ALSO PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO

3M INDEPENDENT OF SUCH PATENTS.

DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH WAS 10.4% FOR 2004. STRONG DEMAND FOR 3M FILMS THAT

BRIGHTEN THE DISPLAYS ON ELECTRONIC PRODUCTS, SUCH AS FLAT-PANEL COMPUTER

MONITORS, CELLULAR PHONES, NOTEBOOK PCS AND LCD TELEVISIONS, CONTINUED TO DRIVE

RESULTS IN 2004. YEAR-ON-YEAR LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH IN THE OPTICAL

SYSTEMS BUSINESS WAS SLOWER IN THE LAST HALF OF 2004, PRIMARILY DUE TO

INVENTORY CHANNEL ADJUSTMENTS IN THE LCD MARKET. THIS RESULTED IN REDUCED

DEMAND FOR 3MS PROPRIETARY OPTICAL FILMS AND COMPONENTS. WHILE THIS BUSINESS

IS SUBJECT TO PERIODIC CUSTOMER INVENTORY FLUCTUATIONS, 3M BELIEVES THAT THIS

BUSINESS WILL CONTINUE TO BE A SIGNIFICANT GROWTH ENGINE FOR 3M. IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2004, 3M ANNOUNCED THE PHASE OUT OF ITS COMMERCIAL VIDEOTAPE BUSINESS,

AND THIS ACTION, COMBINED WITH A CONTINUING DECLINE IN LENS SYSTEMS FOR THE CRT

REAR-PROJECTION TELEVISION MARKET, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SALES AND OPERATING

INCOME. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 27.8% TO $1.131 BILLION IN 2004.

THE STRONG 2003

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH IN THE DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT WAS PRIMARILY

DUE TO OPTICAL SYSTEMS GROWTH, INCLUDING THE CORNING PRECISION LENS ACQUISITION

THAT BENEFITED SALES BY APPROXIMATELY 11%. OPTICAL SYSTEMS GROWTH WAS LED BY

SALES OF DISPLAY ENHANCEMENT FILMS USED IN FLAT-PANEL DEVICES. GEOGRAPHIC AREA

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH WAS LED BY THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA AND THE LATIN

AMERICA, AFRICA AND CANADA AREA. LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH WAS MODERATE IN THE

UNITED STATES AND EUROPE. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 65.8% TO $885 MILLION IN

2003, DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH, PRODUCTION FACILITIES

RUNNING AT HIGH UTILIZATION LEVELS AND BENEFITS FROM 3MS CORPORATE

MASS-MARKET CONSUMER RETAIL AND HOME IMPROVEMENT. THIS INCLUDED STRONG SALES

GROWTH IN CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT/HOME CARE PRODUCTS, OFFICE SUPPLY

PRODUCTS AND STATIONERY PRODUCTS. GEOGRAPHIC AREA LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH WAS LED

BY THE UNITED STATES. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 17.9% TO $542 MILLION IN 2004.

2003 LOCAL-CURRENCY

GROWTH WAS LED BY THE CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT, HOME CARE, AND

STATIONERY PRODUCTS BUSINESSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES

IN THE VISUAL SYSTEMS BUSINESS. GEOGRAPHIC AREA LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH WAS

PRODUCTS FOR COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS, AND ROOFING GRANULES FOR ASPHALT

SHINGLES.

SAFETY, SECURITY AND

PROTECTION SERVICES LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH WAS 6.6% IN 2004.

LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG GLOBAL DEMAND FOR PERSONAL PROTECTIVE

PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS, ALONG WITH CLEANING AND PROTECTIVE PRODUCTS FOR

COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS. 3MS ACQUISITION OF HORNELL HOLDING AB, A EUROPEAN-BASED

GLOBAL SUPPLIER OF

PERSONAL SAFETY

EQUIPMENT, ADDED 2.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF GROWTH IN 2004. OPERATING INCOME

INCREASED 12.3% TO $491 MILLION IN 2004.

2003 LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES

AND OPERATING INCOME INCREASES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH

AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY BUSINESS, WHICH EXPERIENCED HIGHER DEMAND FOR

RESPIRATORY MASKS, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM CONCERNS RELATED TO SEVERE ACUTE

RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS). SECURITY SYSTEMS, COMMERCIAL CARE, BUILDING SAFETY

SOLUTIONS, AND INDUSTRIAL MINERAL PRODUCTS ALSO POSTED LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH

AND OPERATING INCOME IMPROVEMENTS. ALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS SHOWED LOCAL-CURRENCY

GROWTH, WITH GROWTH STRONGEST IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA, AFRICA AND

CANADA AREAS.

UTILITIES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER INDUSTRIES, WITH PRODUCTS THAT SPEED

THE DELIVERY OF INFORMATION AND IDEAS, WHILE ALSO REDUCING COSTS. PRODUCTS

INCLUDE ELECTRONIC AND INTERCONNECT SOLUTIONS, MICROINTERCONNECT SYSTEMS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS

PRODUCTS AND ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS.

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES IN

ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS INCREASED 0.3% FOR 2004, LED BY ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS

FOR INSULATING, TESTING AND SENSING. SALES IN THE ELECTRONICS AND

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SEGMENTS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE GENERAL SLOWDOWN IN

THE SEMICONDUCTOR INDUSTRY AND CONTINUED SOFTNESS IN THE HARD-LINE

INFRASTRUCTURE SEGMENT OF THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKET. GEOGRAPHICALLY,

LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH IN THIS BUSINESS FOR 2004 WAS LED BY THE LATIN AMERICA,

AFRICA AND CANADA AREA ALONG WITH THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA. OPERATING INCOME WAS

UP 14.1% TO $291 MILLION IN 2004.

THE DECREASE IN

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES IN 2003 RESULTED FROM CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE GLOBAL

TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES IN 3MS TELECOM BUSINESS WERE

DOWN OVER 10% FROM 2002. GEOGRAPHIC AREA LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH WAS GOOD IN THE

LATIN AMERICA, AFRICA AND CANADA AREA AND THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA, BUT BOTH THE

UNITED STATES AND EUROPE EXPERIENCED LOCAL-CURRENCY DECLINES OF MORE THAN 10%.

DESPITE A DIFFICULT ECONOMIC AND MARKET ENVIRONMENT, BENEFITS FROM 3MS

CORPORATE INITIATIVES AND PRODUCTIVITY ACTIONS HELPED THIS BUSINESS SLIGHTLY

IMPROVE ITS 2003 OPERATING INCOME. OPERATING INCOME IN 2003 WAS NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY $26 MILLION DUE TO ADDITIONAL EMPLOYEE REDUCTIONS AND ACTIONS TO

PROVIDE BETTER ALIGNMENT WITH THE MARKET ENVIRONMENT WHILE MAINTAINING FOCUS ON

KEY CUSTOMERS.

AUTOMOTIVE, MARINE, AIRCRAFT AND SPECIALTY VEHICLES.

IN TRANSPORTATION,

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH WAS 5.2% IN 2004. TOP-LINE GROWTH IN THIS BUSINESS

CONTINUES TO BENEFIT FROM NEW PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS FOR CUSTOMERS, ALONG WITH

A STRATEGY OF REPLICATING SUCCESSFUL 3M SOLUTIONS ACROSS SEVERAL DISTINCT

SEGMENTS OF THE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRY. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 10.1% TO

$428 MILLION IN 2004.

IN 2003, THE AUTOMOTIVE

OEM AND AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESSES LED LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES AND

OPERATING INCOME GROWTH. THE AEROSPACE AND AIRCRAFT MAINTENANCE BUSINESS ALSO

POSTED LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES AND OPERATING INCOME GROWTH. ALL GEOGRAPHIC AREAS

SHOWED LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH, LED BY THE ASIA PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA,

WHILE 3M MANAGES ITS

BUSINESSES GLOBALLY AND BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS ARE THE MOST

RELEVANT MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA

AS A SECONDARY PERFORMANCE MEASURE. EXPORT SALES ARE REPORTED WITHIN THE

GEOGRAPHIC AREA WHERE THE FINAL SALES TO 3M CUSTOMERS ARE MADE. A PORTION OF

THE PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS SOLD BY 3MS OPERATIONS TO ITS CUSTOMERS ARE

EXPORTED BY THESE CUSTOMERS TO DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. THUS, NET SALES IN A

PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHY MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF END-USER CONSUMPTION IN THAT

GEOGRAPHY.

U.S. 2004 SALES GROWTH

WAS LED BY THE CONSUMER AND OFFICE; SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES;

AND THE INDUSTRIAL BUSINESSES. U.S. OPERATING INCOME WAS DOWN 1%, AS HIGHER

YEAR-ON-YEAR PENSION EXPENSE IMPACTED OPERATING INCOME BY 12%. EUROPEAN

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 0.8%, WITH GROWTH IN SAFETY, SECURITY AND

PROTECTION SERVICES; TRANSPORTATION; INDUSTRIAL; AND HEALTH CARE. FAVORABLE

EXCHANGE RATES, COUPLED WITH ONGOING PRODUCTIVITY EFFORTS, BOOSTED OPERATING

INCOME IN EUROPE BY 24.4% TO ALMOST $1 BILLION. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH IN

THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA WAS 13.6%, WITH ALL SEVEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS POSTING

POSITIVE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH. 3M POSTED 4.3% LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GAINS

IN JAPAN, DESPITE A FAIRLY SLUGGISH ECONOMIC PICTURE IN THE SECOND HALF OF

2004. GROWTH IN THE REST OF THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA WAS 20.7%, LED BY CHINA,

KOREA AND TAIWAN. IN THE COMBINED LATIN AMERICA, AFRICA AND CANADA AREA, SIX OF

SEVEN BUSINESSES HAD LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASES, LED BY ELECTRO AND

COMMUNICATIONS; TRANSPORTATION; INDUSTRIAL; AND HEALTH CARE. FOR 2004,

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS REPRESENTED 60.6% OF 3MS SALES.

EMPLOYMENT.

EMPLOYMENT WAS VIRTUALLY

UNCHANGED FROM YEAR-END 2003. SINCE MARCH 31, 2001, EMPLOYMENT HAS DECLINED BY

NEARLY 10,600 PEOPLE, WITH 6,900 OF THE DECLINE RELATED TO THE 2001/2002

CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING PLAN, AND ADDITIONAL DECLINES DUE TO THE INTEGRATION OF

ACQUISITIONS, ADDITIONAL EMPLOYMENT REDUCTION ACTIONS AND ATTRITION. THE

CORNING PRECISION LENS, INC. ACQUISITION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002 ADDED

APPROXIMATELY 1,500 EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INCREASE HEADCOUNT IN

FASTER-GROWING AREAS OF THE WORLD, SUCH AS ASIA PACIFIC, PRIMARILY TO SUPPORT

INCREASING LOCAL SALES. SALES PER EMPLOYEE IN LOCAL CURRENCIES INCREASED

APPROXIMATELY 7% IN 2004, 8.5% IN 2003 AND APPROXIMATELY 9% IN 2002.

CAPITAL

SPENDING/NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

THE BULK OF 3M CAPITAL

SPENDING HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES, RESULTING IN HIGHER NET

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT BALANCES IN THE U.S. THE COMPANY IS STRIVING TO

MORE CLOSELY ALIGN ITS MANUFACTURING AND SOURCING WITH GEOGRAPHIC MARKET SALES,

AND BECAUSE APPROXIMATELY 60% OF SALES ARE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THIS WOULD

INCREASE PRODUCTION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, HELPING TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER

SERVICE AND REDUCE WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. FOR 2005, THE COMPANY EXPECTS

TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY $950 MILLION ON PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

INFORMATION REGARDING

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AS STATED IN NOTE 1, THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT

THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES

ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS OTHER ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO

BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR

MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE

NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE

ESTIMATES.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS

MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES RELATE TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, THE COMPANYS

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, AND POTENTIAL ASSET IMPAIRMENT ISSUES.

SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT, SELECTION AND DISCLOSURE OF

ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF 3MS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

PLEASE REFER TO THE

SECTION ENTITLED ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTAINED IN PART I, ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, OF THIS ANNUAL

REPORT ON FORM 10-K) FOR A DESCRIPTION OF THE PROCESS THE COMPANY FOLLOWS FOR

THE ACCRUAL AND DISCLOSURE OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES, THE CATEGORIES OF CLAIMS FOR

WHICH THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE ITS PROBABLE LIABILITY AND FOR THE

ESTIMATE OF ITS RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES, AND FACTORS AFFECTING SUCH

ESTIMATES.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

3M HAS VARIOUS

COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES

AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 87, EMPLOYERS

ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS, WHICH REQUIRES THAT AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS BE DETERMINED ON AN ACTUARIAL BASIS. PENSION BENEFITS ASSOCIATED

WITH THESE PLANS ARE GENERALLY BASED PRIMARILY ON EACH PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF

SERVICE, COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. SEE NOTE 11

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION LIABILITY AND EXPENSE.

28

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED

IN THE COMPANYS JUNE 30, 2004 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 FORM 10-QS, IN 2004, THE

COMPANYS U.S. PLAN MEASUREMENT DATE WAS CHANGED FROM SEPTEMBER 30 TO DECEMBER

31. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THIS CHANGE INCLUDE CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE U.S.

AND INTERNATIONAL DATES, THE INCREASED CLARITY THAT RESULTS FROM HAVING THE

SAME MEASUREMENT AND BALANCE SHEET DATES, AND ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION.

THIS CHANGE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE DETERMINATION OF PERIODIC

PENSION COST OR PENSION OBLIGATIONS.

A SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT IN

DETERMINING THE COMPANYS PENSION EXPENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 87

IS THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, WHICH IS BASED ON PROJECTED RESULTS FOR

SIMILAR ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE EXPECTED

RETURN AND THE ACTUAL RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IS DEFERRED AND, UNDER CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, AMORTIZED OVER FUTURE YEARS OF SERVICE. THEREFORE, THE NET

DEFERRAL OF PAST ASSET GAINS (LOSSES) ULTIMATELY AFFECTS FUTURE PENSION

EXPENSE. FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 9.00% FOR 2004. REFER TO NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THIS RATE IS DETERMINED. THE

COMPANY IS LOWERING THE 2005 EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS BY 0.25 PERCENTAGE

POINTS TO 8.75%.

THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PENSION PLAN

LIABILITIES REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE PENSION LIABILITIES COULD BE

EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. IN ESTIMATING THIS RATE, THE

COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS OF SIMILAR

DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN THAT RECEIVE HIGH, INVESTMENT GRADE

RATINGS BY RECOGNIZED RATINGS AGENCIES. BY APPLYING THIS METHODOLOGY, THE

COMPANY DETERMINED A DISCOUNT RATE OF 5.75% TO BE APPROPRIATE AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2004, WHICH IS A REDUCTION OF 0.25 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM THE

RATE USED AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2003.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE CHANGE IN THE MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY WITHIN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INCREASED STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY BY

$1.193 BILLION (AFTER-TAX). THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE

ASSETS BEING ABOVE THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR THE U.S. QUALIFIED

PLAN, WHICH CAUSED THE MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY RECORDED FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002 TO BE REVERSED. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANYS U.S.

QUALIFIED PLAN RECORDED A PREPAID PENSION ASSET OF $1.851 BILLION.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED TOTAL CONSOLIDATED PRE-TAX

PENSION EXPENSE (AFTER SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS AND SPECIAL TERMINATION

BENEFITS) OF $325 MILLION, UP FROM $168 MILLION IN 2003. PENSION

EXPENSE (BEFORE SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS AND SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS) IS

ANTICIPATED TO INCREASE TO APPROXIMATELY $342 MILLION IN 2005. AS

PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, THE COMPANY LOWERED THE EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS

ASSUMPTION FROM 9.00% IN 2004 TO 8.75% IN 2005. FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLANS, HOLDING

ALL OTHER FACTORS CONSTANT, AN INCREASE/DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE

OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS BY 0.25 PERCENTAGE POINTS WOULD DECREASE/INCREASE U.S.

PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $19 MILLION IN 2005. FOR THE U.S. PENSION

PLANS, HOLDING ALL OTHER FACTORS CONSTANT, AN INCREASE/DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT

RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES BY 0.25 PERCENTAGE POINTS WOULD

DECREASE/INCREASE U.S. PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION IN

2005.

POTENTIAL ASSET IMPAIRMENT ISSUES.

3M NET PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $5.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004.

MANAGEMENT MAKES ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR WHICH ACTUAL RESULTS WILL EMERGE OVER LONG PERIODS OF

TIME. THIS INCLUDES THE RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EMPLOYED IN THE

BUSINESS, INCLUDING ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS ARE CLOSELY MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND PERIODICALLY ADJUSTED AS

CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. FOR INSTANCE, EXPECTED ASSET LIVES MAY BE SHORTENED OR

AN IMPAIRMENT RECORDED BASED ON A CHANGE IN THE EXPECTED USE OF THE ASSET OR

PERFORMANCE OF THE RELATED BUSINESS REPORTING UNIT. IN ADDITION, 3M GOODWILL

TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, WHICH, BASED ON IMPAIRMENT

TESTING, IS NOT IMPAIRED. A PORTION OF THIS GOODWILL (APPROXIMATELY $300

MILLION) IS IN 3MS TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS, WHICH COMPETES IN A VERY

UNCERTAIN INDUSTRY. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THIS BUSINESS WILL MAINTAIN ITS

VALUE, EVENTS SUCH AS A SIGNIFICANT ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE,

COULD CREATE FUTURE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 123 (REVISED 2004), SHARE-BASED PAYMENT. SFAS

NO. 123R SUPERSEDES APB OPINION NO. 25, WHICH REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF AN

EXPENSE WHEN GOODS OR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. SFAS NO. 123R REQUIRES THE

DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AT THE GRANT

DATE AND THE RECOGNITION OF THE RELATED EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION VESTS. THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE PROVISIONS

OF SFAS NO. 123R EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2005. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING THIS

AND OTHER ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CREDIT RATING FROM MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE. THE COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT ACCESS

TO CAPITAL MARKETS TO MEET CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED GROWTH AND ACQUISITION

INVESTMENT FUNDING NEEDS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT UTILIZE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

LINKED TO THE COMPANYS STOCK.

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, REMAINED STRONG. VARIOUS ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING CASH AND SHORT-TERM DEBT, CAN FLUCTUATE

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MONTH-TO-MONTH DEPENDING ON SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

WORKING CAPITAL (DEFINED AS CURRENT ASSETS MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES) TOTALED

$2.649 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, COMPARED WITH $2.638 BILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2003. THIS SLIGHT INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO AN INCREASE IN CASH

($921 MILLION) OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN DEBT CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM

BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT ($892 MILLION). THE CASH

BALANCE BENEFITED FROM HIGHER NET INCOME AND WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS IN

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.

THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS WORKING CAPITAL MEASURES THAT

PLACE EMPHASIS AND FOCUS ON CERTAIN WORKING CAPITAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

(I.E. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE). THESE MEASURES MAY NOT

BE COMPUTED THE SAME AS SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. THE

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TURNOVER INDEX (DEFINED AS QUARTERLY NET SALES  FOURTH QUARTER AT YEAR-END  MULTIPLIED BY FOUR, DIVIDED BY

ENDING NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE) TOTALED 7.29 AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AN

IMPROVEMENT FROM 6.95 AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. RECEIVABLES INCREASED $78 MILLION

COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2003, WITH CURRENCY TRANSLATION OF $120 MILLION (DUE

TO THE WEAKER U.S. DOLLAR) DRIVING THIS INCREASE. THE INVENTORY TURNOVER INDEX

(DEFINED AS QUARTERLY FACTORY COST 

FOURTH QUARTER AT YEAR-END 

MULTIPLIED BY FOUR, DIVIDED BY ENDING INVENTORY) WAS 5.29 AT DECEMBER 31, 2004,

AN IMPROVEMENT FROM 5.12 AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. INVENTORIES INCREASED $81

MILLION COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2003, WITH CURRENCY TRANSLATION OF $80

MILLION ACCOUNTING FOR ALMOST ALL OF THIS INCREASE. ANOTHER WORKING CAPITAL

MEASURE USED BY THE COMPANY ALSO REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. THIS

COMBINED INDEX (DEFINED AS QUARTERLY NET SALES  FOURTH QUARTER AT YEAR-END 

MULTIPLIED BY FOUR, DIVIDED BY ENDING NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PLUS INVENTORY

LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE) WAS 5.78 AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AN IMPROVEMENT FROM 5.48

AT DECEMBER 31, 2003. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCREASED $81 MILLION COMPARED TO

IMPROVEMENTS (I.E. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLES, INVENTORIES, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE). IN ALL

COMPANY PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED CASH

FLOWS. IN ALL YEARS, WITH LARGER AMOUNTS IN 2003 AND 2002, A PORTION OF THE TAX

TIMING BENEFIT RELATES TO THE TAX BENEFIT RECEIVED FROM COMPANY PENSION

CONTRIBUTIONS. IN 2003, 3M MADE $46 MILLION OF PAYMENTS UNDER THE CORPORATE

RESTRUCTURING PLAN, COMPARED WITH $306 MILLION IN 2002.

IN THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, THE COMPANY

MADE A SPECIAL PENSION CONTRIBUTION TO 3MS JAPANESE PENSION PLAN OF $155

MILLION AND A DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION OF $300 MILLION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED

PENSION PLAN. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, 3M MADE A DISCRETIONARY

CONTRIBUTION OF $600 MILLION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN, COMPARED WITH

A DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION OF $789 MILLION IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002.

FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS, INTEREST RATES AND OTHER

FACTORS. 3M BELIEVES ITS STRONG CASH FLOW AND BALANCE SHEET WILL ALLOW IT TO

FUND FUTURE PENSION NEEDS WITHOUT COMPROMISING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE RECAPS FOR BREAST IMPLANT AND

RESPIRATOR MASKS/ASBESTOS LITIGATION THE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED INSURANCE

RECEIVABLES, CASH RECEIVED FROM INSURANCE, CASH FEES AND PAYMENTS MADE, AND THE

PRE-TAX EXPENSE FOR 2004 AND 2003. BECAUSE OF THE TIME DELAY BETWEEN PAYMENT OF

CLAIMS AND RECEIPT OF INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENTS, THE DECEMBER 31, 2004, AMOUNTS

FOR BOTH BREAST IMPLANT AND RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES ARE LESS THAN

EXPECTED INSURANCE RECOVERIES. THUS, THE EXPECTED NET INFLOW OF CASH WILL

INCREASE FUTURE CASH FLOWS. THE COMPANY RECORDED THE LEPAGES VERDICT LIABILITY

OF $93 MILLION PRE-TAX IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003. FOR A MORE DETAILED

TOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER

31, 2004, WAS $2.821 BILLION, DOWN FROM $2.937 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2003, DUE TO

THE STRONG CASH FLOW GENERATED DURING 2004. IN 2004, THE CASH FLOW INCREASE IN

NET SHORT-TERM DEBT OF $399 MILLION INCLUDES THE PORTION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT

WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF 90 DAYS OR LESS. THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT OF $868

MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO COMMERCIAL PAPER RETIREMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $475

MILLION AND THE RETIREMENTS OF $350 MILLION IN MEDIUM-TERM NOTES. PROCEEDS FROM

DEBT OF $358 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES. TOTAL

DEBT WAS 21% OF TOTAL CAPITAL (TOTAL CAPITAL IS DEFINED AS DEBT PLUS EQUITY),

COMPARED WITH 27% AT YEAR-END 2003.

DEBT SECURITIES,

INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHELF REGISTRATION, ITS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM,

DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES AND CONVERTIBLE NOTE ARE ALL DISCUSSED IN MORE

DETAIL IN NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. 3M HAS A SHELF

REGISTRATION AND MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH $1.5 BILLION OF

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MAY BE OFFERED. IN 2004, THE COMPANY ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $62

MILLION IN DEBT SECURITIES UNDER ITS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM. THE MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM AND SHELF

REGISTRATION HAVE REMAINING CAPACITY OF APPROXIMATELY $1.438 BILLION. THE

COMPANYS $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES (CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT

PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT) WERE REMARKETED FOR ONE YEAR IN DECEMBER 2004. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS A CONVERTIBLE NOTE WITH A BOOK VALUE OF $556 MILLION

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES,

CONVERTIBLE NOTE AND $62 MILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT

PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS THE RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE

DEBT INSTRUMENTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY

32

DOES NOT ANTICIPATE

REDEMPTION OF THESE SECURITIES IN 2005. FOR A DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING

PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT WILL AFFECT ACCOUNTING TREATMENT FOR THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE,

REFER TO NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DISCUSSION OF EITF

ISSUE NO. 04-08, THE EFFECT OF CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT ON DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE AND PROPOSED SFAS NO. 128R, EARNINGS PER SHARE.

REPURCHASES OF COMMON

STOCK ARE MADE TO SUPPORT THE COMPANYS STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS

AND FOR OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. ON NOVEMBER 10, 2003, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

AUTHORIZED THE PURCHASE OF UP TO $1.5 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK

BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2004 AND DECEMBER 31, 2004. IN NOVEMBER 2004, 3MS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL $200 MILLION OF THE

COMPANYS COMMON STOCK IN 2004 AND ALSO AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $2.0

BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2005 AND JANUARY 31,

2006. REFER TO THE TABLE CAPTIONED ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES IN

PART II, ITEM 5, FOR MORE INFORMATION.

CASH DIVIDENDS PAID TO

STOCKHOLDERS TOTALED $1.125 BILLION ($1.44 PER SHARE) IN 2004, $1.034 BILLION

($1.32 PER SHARE) IN 2003 AND $968 MILLION ($1.24 PER SHARE) IN 2002. 3M HAS

PAID DIVIDENDS SINCE 1916. IN FEBRUARY 2005, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED

THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON 3M COMMON STOCK TO 42 CENTS PER SHARE, EQUIVALENT TO

AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF $1.68 PER SHARE. THIS MARKS THE 47TH CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF

DIVIDEND INCREASES.

OTHER CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCLUDE

DISTRIBUTIONS TO MINORITY INTERESTS, CHANGES IN CASH OVERDRAFT BALANCES, AND

PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FOR CAPITAL LEASES.

LIQUIDITY.

THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY REMAINS STRONG. PRIMARY

SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARE PROVIDED THROUGH U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER AND EURO

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, OUTSTANDING TOTAL

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED TOTALED $671 MILLION AND AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY $387

MILLION DURING 2004. MEDIUM-TERM NOTE SHELF BORROWING CAPACITY TOTALED $1.438

BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. CREDIT SUPPORT FOR OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL

PAPER IS PROVIDED BY A $565 MILLION, 364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT AMONG A GROUP OF

PRIMARY RELATIONSHIP BANKS. THIS FACILITY PROVIDES UP TO $115 MILLION IN

LETTERS OF CREDIT ($86 MILLION OF WHICH WAS UTILIZED AT DECEMBER 31, 2004). IN

2005, IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE 364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT WILL BE REPLACED BY A

FIVE-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH TERMS SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME AS THAT OF THE CURRENT

AGREEMENT. COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES OF $53 MILLION ARE IN PLACE ACROSS

SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARY LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS UNCOMMITTED

LINES OF CREDIT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES TOTALING $637 MILLION.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ITS ACCESS TO

THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET WILL BE RESTRICTED. CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND

CERTAIN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY TO MEET NEAR

TERM OBLIGATIONS, IF NECESSARY. AT YEAR-END 2004, CERTAIN DEBT AGREEMENTS ($350

MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES AND $202 MILLION OF ESOP DEBT) HAD

RATINGS TRIGGERS (BBB-/BAA3 OR LOWER) THAT WOULD REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF DEBT. THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS AA/AA1 DEBT RATINGS. IN ADDITION, THE $565 MILLION,

364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT REQUIRES 3M TO MAINTAIN A CAPITALIZATION RATIO AT NO

MORE THAN 0.60 TO 1 AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER. THIS RATIO IS CALCULATED AS

FUNDED DEBT (INCLUDING ALL BORROWED MONEY AND LETTERS OF CREDIT UTILIZED) TO

THE SUM OF FUNDED DEBT AND EQUITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THIS RATIO WAS

APPROXIMATELY 0.22 TO 1.

3MS CASH BALANCE AT DECEMBER

31, 2004 TOTALED $2.757 BILLION. 3MS STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY

PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NUMEROUS

OPPORTUNITIES GOING FORWARD. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ITS

OPERATIONS TO DRIVE GROWTH, INCLUDING CONTINUAL REVIEW OF ACQUISITION

OPPORTUNITIES. 3M PAID DIVIDENDS OF MORE THAN $1.1 BILLION IN 2004, AND HAS A

LONG HISTORY OF DIVIDEND INCREASES. 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE

PURCHASE OF UP TO $2.0 BILLION OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK BETWEEN JANUARY 1,

2005 AND JANUARY 31, 2006. THE COMPANY MAY ALSO MAKE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS

TO ITS PENSION PLAN IN THE FUTURE, BUT EXACT AMOUNTS ARE UNCERTAIN AND WILL

DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD NOT UTILIZED

SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES TO FACILITATE OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING

ARRANGEMENTS. 3MS ACCRUED PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITIES, RECORDED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS PART OF CURRENT AND LONG-TERM LIABILITIES, ARE

ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY $22 MILLION. 3M DOES NOT CONSIDER THIS AMOUNT TO BE

MATERIAL. THE FAIR VALUE OF 3M GUARANTEES OF LOANS WITH THIRD PARTIES AND OTHER

GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.

IN ADDITION TO

GUARANTEES, 3M, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, PERIODICALLY ENTERS INTO

AGREEMENTS THAT REQUIRE 3M TO INDEMNIFY EITHER MAJOR CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS FOR

SPECIFIC RISKS, SUCH AS CLAIMS FOR INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE ARISING OUT OF 3M

PRODUCTS OR THE NEGLIGENCE OF 3M PERSONNEL, OR CLAIMS ALLEGING THAT 3M PRODUCTS

INFRINGE

33

THIRD PARTY PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WHILE 3MS MAXIMUM

EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS CANNOT BE ESTIMATED, THESE

INDEMNIFICATIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COMPANYS SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, FOLLOWS.

LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS

DUE IN 2005 INCLUDE $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES (FINAL

MATURITY 2010), $62 MILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES (FINAL MATURITY 2044), AND

$556 MILLION OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES (FINAL MATURITY 2032). THESE SECURITIES ARE

CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS THE RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS.

UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS ARE DEFINED AS AN AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES THAT IS

ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING ON THE COMPANY. INCLUDED IN THE UNCONDITIONAL

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS CATEGORY ABOVE ARE CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO TAKE OR

PAY CONTRACTS, CAPITAL COMMITMENTS, SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND UTILITIES. THESE

ESTIMATES INCLUDE BOTH UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH TERMS IN EXCESS

OF ONE YEAR AND NORMAL ONGOING PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH TERMS OF LESS THAN ONE

YEAR. MANY OF THESE COMMITMENTS RELATE TO TAKE OR PAY CONTRACTS, IN WHICH 3M

GUARANTEES PAYMENT TO ENSURE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT ARE SOLD

TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE CONSIDERATION (PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES) FOR THESE UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS. THE PURCHASE OBLIGATION

AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE ENTIRE ANTICIPATED PURCHASES IN THE FUTURE, BUT

REPRESENT ONLY THOSE ITEMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED.

THE MAJORITY OF 3MS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PURCHASED AS NEEDED, WITH NO

UNCONDITIONAL COMMITMENT. FOR THIS REASON, THESE NUMBERS WILL NOT PROVIDE A

RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH OUTFLOWS ON A

STAND-ALONE BASIS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11

TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED

MINIMUM PENSION CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2005. THUS,

COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS ARE EXPECTED

TO BE LARGELY DISCRETIONARY IN 2005 AND FUTURE YEARS. CONTRACTUAL CAPITAL

COMMITMENTS ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE, BUT THESE COMMITMENTS

REPRESENT A SMALL PART OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED CAPITAL SPENDING IN 2005 AND

BEYOND. FOR 2005, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY $950 MILLION ON

PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

CONTRACTUAL DERIVATIVE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO

MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE, INTEREST RATE RISKS AND COMMODITY PRICE

RISKS. A FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, COMPOSED OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT,

PROVIDES OVERSIGHT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES. THIS

COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RISK POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES, AND

PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT UTILIZATION. THIS COMMITTEE ALSO

ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES FOR CONTROL AND VALUATION, RISK ANALYSIS, COUNTERPARTY

CREDIT APPROVAL, AND ONGOING MONITORING AND REPORTING.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAPS TO HEDGE AGAINST THE

EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY MANAGES

INTEREST RATE RISKS USING A MIX OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATE DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE

BORROWING COSTS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS. UNDER THESE

ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY AGREES TO EXCHANGE, AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND FLOATING INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE

TO AN AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY

PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION SWAPS AND

FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

34

A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE

STATISTICAL MODELING TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO TEST THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO

CHANGES IN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES AND ASSESS THE RISK OF LOSS IN AFTER-TAX

EARNINGS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVES AND UNDERLYING EXPOSURES

OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE MODEL (THIRD-PARTY BANK DATASET) USED A

95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL OVER A 12-MONTH TIME HORIZON. BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS OF

THE COMPANYS INTEREST RATE RISKS, POSSIBLE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES WOULD NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON AFTER-TAX EARNINGS ($5 MILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2004 AND $6 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003). BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS OF THE

PRIMARY FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS, POSSIBLE CHANGES IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES

COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT AFTER-TAX EARNINGS BY $61 MILLION ($67 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003). WHEN INCLUDING CERTAIN COMMODITY RISKS, POSSIBLE CHANGES IN

COMMODITY RATES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT AFTER-TAX EARNINGS BY AN ADDITIONAL $10

MILLION (AN ADDITIONAL $3 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003). THE MODEL USED

ANALYZED OVER 20 DIFFERENT CURRENCIES AND FIVE COMMODITIES, BUT DOES NOT

PURPORT TO REPRESENT WHAT ACTUALLY WILL BE EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY. THIS

MODEL DOES NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN HEDGE TRANSACTIONS, BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THEIR INCLUSION WOULD NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS STRIVING

TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN ITS MANUFACTURING AND SOURCING WITH GEOGRAPHIC MARKET

SALES, AND BECAUSE APPROXIMATELY 60% OF SALES ARE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES,

THIS WOULD INCREASE PRODUCTION OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THIS WILL ALSO HELP

MITIGATE THE EFFECTS FROM CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS. IN 2001, THE COMPANY INCREASED

THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES TO HELP LESSEN

YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACTS AND TO IMPROVE THE PREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE EARNINGS.

HOWEVER, THIS HEDGING PROGRAM WILL NOT MAKE 3M IMMUNE TO CURRENCY IMPACTS.

THE

GLOBAL EXPOSURES RELATED TO PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS ARE SUCH THAT A

ONE PERCENT PRICE CHANGE WOULD RESULT IN A PRE-TAX COST OR SAVINGS OF

APPROXIMATELY $44 MILLION PER YEAR. THE GLOBAL ENERGY EXPOSURE IS SUCH THAT A

10% PRICE CHANGE WOULD RESULT IN A PRE-TAX COST OR SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $30

MILLION PER YEAR. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE USED TO HEDGE LESS THAN ONE

PERCENT OF THE PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS EXPOSURE AND ARE USED TO

HEDGE APPROXIMATELY 10% OF THIS ENERGY EXPOSURE.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON

FORM 10-K, INCLUDING MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN ITEM 7, CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT

OF 1995. THESE STATEMENTS MAY BE IDENTIFIED BY THE USE OF WORDS LIKE PLAN,

EXPECT, AIM, BELIEVE, PROJECT, ANTICIPATE, INTEND, ESTIMATE,

WILL, SHOULD, COULD AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS IN CONNECTION WITH ANY

DISCUSSION, EXPECTATION OR PROJECTION OF FUTURE OPERATING OR FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE, EVENTS OR TRENDS. IN PARTICULAR, THESE INCLUDE STATEMENTS ABOUT

THE COMPANYS STRATEGY FOR GROWTH, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, MARKET POSITION, FUTURE

PERFORMANCE OR RESULTS OF CURRENT OR ANTICIPATED PRODUCTS, INTEREST RATES,

FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, AND THE OUTCOME OF CONTINGENCIES, SUCH AS LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS.

FACTORS THAT COULD AFFECT

FUTURE RESULTS  FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS

AND EXPECTATIONS OF FUTURE EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES.

ACTUAL FUTURE RESULTS AND TRENDS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM HISTORICAL RESULTS

OR THOSE PROJECTED IN ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS DEPENDING ON A

VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE FOLLOWING.



RESULTS AND TRENDS ARE IMPACTED BY THE EFFECTS OF, AND CHANGES IN,

WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

. THE COMPANY OPERATES IN MORE THAN 60

COUNTRIES AND DERIVES APPROXIMATELY 60% OF ITS REVENUES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES

AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL, SUCH AS DOWNTURNS IN ECONOMIC

ACTIVITY IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION; SOCIAL, POLITICAL OR LABOR CONDITIONS

IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION; OR POTENTIAL ADVERSE FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES.



FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THOSE RATES MAY

AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO REALIZE PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN ITS SALES AND

NET EARNINGS AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY

DERIVES APPROXIMATELY 60% OF ITS REVENUES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, ITS

ABILITY TO REALIZE PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN SALES AND NET EARNINGS COULD BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS SIGNIFICANTLY AGAINST FOREIGN

CURRENCIES.



THE COMPANYS GROWTH OBJECTIVES ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TIMING

AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF ITS NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING

ITS ABILITY TO RENEW ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND

TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

THIS ABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY

AFFECTED BY DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, SUCH AS THE

INABILITY TO: IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW PRODUCTS; OBTAIN ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY PROTECTION; GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS; OR SUCCESSFULLY

COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS AND OBTAIN REGULATORY APPROVALS. FOR EXAMPLE, NEW 3M

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS, LIKE ANY PHARMACEUTICAL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, FACE

SUBSTANTIAL RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT AND

REGULATORY REVIEW. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT NEW PRODUCTS WILL PROVE TO BE

COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL.

35



THE COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COSTS

AND AVAILABILITY OF PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS,

INCLUDING OIL-DERIVED COMPOUNDS,

DUE TO MARKET DEMAND, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS, MATERIAL SHORTAGES AND

OTHER FACTORS

. THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON VARIOUS COMPONENTS AND

MATERIALS SUPPLIED BY OTHERS FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF ITS PRODUCTS AND IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT ANY OF ITS SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS COULD BE INTERRUPTED OR

TERMINATED IN THE FUTURE. ANY SUSTAINED INTERRUPTION IN THE COMPANYS RECEIPT

OF ADEQUATE SUPPLIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY. IN

ADDITION, WHILE THE COMPANY HAS A PROCESS TO MINIMIZE VOLATILITY IN COMPONENT

AND MATERIAL PRICING, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE

TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS DUE TO MARKET DEMAND, CURRENCY RISKS

OR MATERIAL SHORTAGES, OR THAT FUTURE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.



THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES MAY

NOT MEET SALES AND/OR PROFIT EXPECTATIONS

. AS PART OF THE COMPANYS

STRATEGY FOR GROWTH, THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND MAY CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS

AND ENTER INTO STRATEGIC ALLIANCES. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT THE

COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO QUICKLY INTEGRATE THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS AND OBTAIN THE

ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES OR THAT ACQUISITIONS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES WILL BE

BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANY.



THE COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED

IF THE COMPANY GENERATES LESS OPERATING INCOME FROM ITS CORPORATE INITIATIVES

THAN ESTIMATED

. 3MS CORPORATE INITIATIVES INCLUDE SIX SIGMA, GLOBAL

SOURCING EFFECTIVENESS, 3M ACCELERATION, EPRODUCTIVITY AND GLOBAL BUSINESS

PROCESSES. COST REDUCTION PROJECTS RELATED TO THESE INITIATIVES ARE EXPECTED TO

CONTRIBUTE AN ADDITIONAL $400 MILLION TO OPERATING INCOME IN 2005. THERE

CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ALL OF THE ESTIMATED OPERATING INCOME IMPROVEMENTS

FROM THE INITIATIVES WILL BE REALIZED.



THE COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED

BY VARIOUS LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING PRODUCT

LIABILITY, ANTITRUST, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHER MATTERS.

THE OUTCOME OF

THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY DIFFER FROM THE COMPANYS EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE THE

OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION, INCLUDING REGULATORY MATTERS, ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO

RELIABLY PREDICT. VARIOUS FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN LEAD THE COMPANY TO

CHANGE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES AND RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES WHERE

APPLICABLE, OR MAKE SUCH ESTIMATES FOR MATTERS PREVIOUSLY NOT SUSCEPTIBLE OF

REASONABLE ESTIMATES, SUCH AS A SIGNIFICANT JUDICIAL RULING OR JUDGMENT,

SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A FUTURE ADVERSE RULING,

SETTLEMENT OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH

FLOWS IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD. A SPECIFIC FACTOR THAT MAY INFLUENCE THE

COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ITS FUTURE ASBESTOS-RELATED LIABILITIES IS THE PENDING

CONGRESSIONAL CONSIDERATION OF LEGISLATION TO REFORM ASBESTOS-RELATED

LITIGATION AND PERTINENT INFORMATION DERIVED FROM THAT PROCESS. FOR A MORE

DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE COMPANY AND ASSOCIATED

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, SEE THE DISCUSSION OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN PART I, ITEM

3 OF THIS DOCUMENT.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE

DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

IN

THE CONTEXT OF ITEM 7A, MARKET RISK REFERS TO THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE

CHANGES IN FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT MARKET RATES AND PRICES, SUCH AS

FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE COMPANY

DISCUSSES RISK MANAGEMENT IN VARIOUS PLACES THROUGHOUT THIS DOCUMENT, INCLUDING

DISCUSSIONS IN ITEM 7 CONCERNING FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY, AND

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (LONG-TERM

DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

AND THE DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES ACCOUNTING POLICY). ALL DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITY IS GOVERNED BY WRITTEN POLICIES, AND A VALUE-AT-RISK ANALYSIS IS

PROVIDED FOR THESE DERIVATIVES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE LEVERAGED DERIVATIVE

POSITIONS.

MANAGEMENTS

RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INTEGRITY AND

OBJECTIVITY OF THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT. THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WHERE NECESSARY, THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT ESTIMATES BASED ON MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT.

MANAGEMENT HAS ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF

INTERNAL ACCOUNTING AND OTHER CONTROLS FOR THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

THIS SYSTEM AND ITS ESTABLISHED ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES AND RELATED CONTROLS ARE

DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT ASSETS ARE SAFEGUARDED, THAT THE

BOOKS AND RECORDS PROPERLY REFLECT ALL TRANSACTIONS, THAT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES

ARE IMPLEMENTED BY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, AND THAT PUBLISHED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ARE PROPERLY PREPARED AND FAIRLY PRESENTED. THE COMPANYS SYSTEM OF INTERNAL

CONTROL IS SUPPORTED BY WIDELY COMMUNICATED WRITTEN POLICIES, INCLUDING

BUSINESS CONDUCT POLICIES, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO REQUIRE ALL EMPLOYEES TO

MAINTAIN HIGH ETHICAL STANDARDS IN THE CONDUCT OF COMPANY AFFAIRS. INTERNAL

AUDITORS CONTINUALLY REVIEW THE ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL SYSTEM.

3M COMPANY

MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND

MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.

BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004,

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE.

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT

OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH

IS INCLUDED HEREIN.

3M COMPANY

38

REPORT

OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE STOCKHOLDERS AND

BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 3M COMPANY.

WE HAVE COMPLETED AN

INTEGRATED AUDIT OF 3M COMPANYS 2004 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OF

ITS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND

AUDITS OF ITS 2003 AND 2002 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE

WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED

STATES). OUR OPINIONS, BASED ON OUR AUDITS, ARE PRESENTED BELOW.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS

IN OUR OPINION, THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX PRESENT

FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF 3M COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY)

AT DECEMBER

31, 2004 AND 2003, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR

EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED

IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN

OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR

AUDITS OF THESE STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE

THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING

THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND

EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR

AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING

ALSO, IN OUR OPINION,

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

THAT THE

COMPANY MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2004 BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO),

IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THOSE

CRITERIA. FURTHERMORE, IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2004, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COSO.

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND ON

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

BASED ON OUR AUDIT. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING

OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. AN AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES

OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING

EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE

CONSIDER NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION

OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE

MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY;

(II) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF

THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT

AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR

DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT

LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO

FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE

BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE

POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS

NOTE 1

.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION.

3M IS A DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL MANUFACTURER, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATOR AND MARKETER OF A

WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS. ALL SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. ALL

SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERM

3M OR COMPANY REFERS TO 3M COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE CONTEXT

INDICATES OTHERWISE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

LOCAL CURRENCIES GENERALLY ARE CONSIDERED THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR OPERATIONS IN LOCAL-CURRENCY

ENVIRONMENTS ARE TRANSLATED AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES. INCOME AND EXPENSE

ITEMS ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR.

CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

RECLASSIFICATIONS.

CERTAIN

PRIOR PERIOD BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM WITH THE

CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

USE OF ESTIMATES.

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE

DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE

REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH AND TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS WITH

MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS WHEN PURCHASED.

INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE

POLICIES, REAL ESTATE NOT USED IN THE BUSINESS, VENTURE CAPITAL AND

EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO INVESTMENTS

CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

INVENTORIES.

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, WITH COST GENERALLY

DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED INTEREST AND INTERNAL

ENGINEERING COSTS, ARE RECORDED AT COST. DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT GENERALLY IS COMPUTED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD BASED ON THE

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF BUILDINGS

AND IMPROVEMENTS PRIMARILY RANGE FROM 10 TO 40 YEARS, WITH THE MAJORITY IN THE

RANGE OF 20 TO 40 YEARS. MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES

PRIMARILY RANGE FROM THREE TO 15 YEARS, WITH THE MAJORITY IN THE RANGE OF FIVE

TO 10 YEARS. FULLY DEPRECIATED ASSETS ARE RETAINED IN PROPERTY AND ACCUMULATED

DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTS UNTIL DISPOSAL. UPON DISPOSAL, ASSETS AND RELATED

ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE ACCOUNTS AND THE NET AMOUNT, LESS

PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSAL, IS CHARGED OR CREDITED TO OPERATIONS. PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT AMOUNTS ARE REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET (ASSET GROUP) MAY

NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS

EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION. THE

AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECORDED IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE

ASSETS CARRYING VALUE OVER ITS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED

USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.

GOODWILL.

GOODWILL IS THE EXCESS OF COST OF AN ACQUIRED ENTITY OVER THE

AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION.

GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, AND WILL

BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY BE IMPAIRED.

IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR GOODWILL IS DONE AT A REPORTING UNIT LEVEL. REPORTING

UNITS ARE ONE LEVEL BELOW THE BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL, BUT CAN BE COMBINED WHEN

REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE SAME SEGMENT HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS.

3M HAS 18 REPORTING UNITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE MAJORITY OF GOODWILL

RELATES TO AND IS ASSIGNED DIRECTLY TO A SPECIFIC REPORTING UNIT. AN IMPAIRMENT

LOSS GENERALLY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING

UNITS NET ASSETS EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED USING EARNINGS FOR THE

REPORTING UNIT MULTIPLIED BY A PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO FOR COMPARABLE INDUSTRY

GROUPS, OR BY USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS

ASSESSMENT OF ANY POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT UPON ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD AND

PERFORMS ANNUAL ASSESSMENTS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT TEST IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 AND DETERMINED THAT NO GOODWILL

WAS IMPAIRED.

44

INTANGIBLE

ASSETS.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDE PATENTS, TRADENAMES AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM AN INDEPENDENT PARTY. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE, NAMELY CERTAIN TRADENAMES, ARE NOT AMORTIZED.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS,

WITH ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM TWO TO 20 YEARS. INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, AND WILL BE TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT

WOULD INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY BE IMPAIRED. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH

A DEFINITE LIFE ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THAT A CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET (ASSET GROUP) MAY NOT BE

RECOVERABLE. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT NO MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS EXISTED AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT

OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USED IN DETERMINING

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECORDED

IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUE OVER ITS FAIR VALUE.

FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. COSTS

RELATED TO INTERNALLY DEVELOPED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

REVENUE (SALES) RECOGNITION.

THE COMPANY SELLS A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSIFIED BASE OF CUSTOMERS

AROUND THE WORLD AND HAS NO MATERIAL CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. REVENUE IS

RECOGNIZED WHEN THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF

OWNERSHIP HAVE SUBSTANTIVELY TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS. THIS CONDITION NORMALLY

IS MET WHEN THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN DELIVERED OR UPON PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES. THE

COMPANY RECORDS ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR CUSTOMER AND DISTRIBUTOR INCENTIVES,

SUCH AS REBATES, AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE.

THE MAJORITY OF 3MS

SALES AGREEMENTS ARE FOR STANDARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH CUSTOMER

ACCEPTANCE OCCURRING UPON DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCT OR PERFORMANCE OF THE

SERVICE. 3M ALSO ENTERS INTO AGREEMENTS THAT CONTAIN MULTIPLE-ELEMENTS (SUCH AS

EQUIPMENT, INSTALLATION AND SERVICE) OR NON-STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS. FOR

MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, 3M RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR DELIVERED ELEMENTS

WHEN THE DELIVERED ITEM HAS STAND-ALONE VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER, FAIR VALUES OF

UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS ARE KNOWN, CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE HAS OCCURRED, AND THERE ARE

ONLY CUSTOMARY REFUND OR RETURN RIGHTS RELATED TO THE DELIVERED ELEMENTS. IN

ADDITION TO THE PRECEDING CONDITIONS, EQUIPMENT REVENUE IS NOT RECORDED UNTIL

THE INSTALLATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED IF EQUIPMENT ACCEPTANCE IS DEPENDENT UPON

INSTALLATION, OR IF INSTALLATION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE

EQUIPMENT. INSTALLATION REVENUES ARE NOT RECORDED UNTIL INSTALLATION HAS BEEN

COMPLETED. FOR PREPAID SERVICE CONTRACTS, SALES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT, UNLESS HISTORICAL EVIDENCE

INDICATES THE COSTS ARE INCURRED ON OTHER THAN A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. LICENSE

FEE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EARNED, WITH NO REVENUE RECOGNIZED UNTIL THE

INCEPTION OF THE LICENSE TERM. ON OCCASION, AGREEMENTS WILL CONTAIN MILESTONES,

OR 3M WILL RECOGNIZE REVENUE BASED ON PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE. FOR THESE

AGREEMENTS, AND DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFICS, 3M MAY RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON COMPLETION

OF A SUBSTANTIVE MILESTONE, OR IN PROPORTION TO COSTS INCURRED.

ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCES.

TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE

RECORDED AT THE INVOICED AMOUNT AND DO NOT BEAR INTEREST. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS

ALLOWANCES FOR BAD DEBTS, CASH DISCOUNTS, PRODUCT RETURNS AND VARIOUS OTHER

ADJUSTMENTS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND PRODUCT RETURNS ARE BASED

ON THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES IN EXISTING

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ANTICIPATED SALES RETURNS. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE

ALLOWANCES BASED ON HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE BY INDUSTRY AND REGIONAL

ECONOMIC DATA AND HISTORICAL SALES RETURNS. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE ALLOWANCE

FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS MONTHLY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

ADVERTISING AND MERCHANDISING.

THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS IN THE YEAR INCURRED, AND TOTALED $433

MILLION IN 2004, $405 MILLION IN 2003 AND $372 MILLION IN 2002.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED

EXPENSES.

THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS IN THE YEAR

INCURRED AND ARE SHOWN ON A SEPARATE LINE OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, COVERING BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH

AND THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND

IMPROVED PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, TOTALED $759 MILLION IN 2004, $749 MILLION IN

2003 AND $738 MILLION IN 2002. RELATED EXPENSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TECHNICAL

SUPPORT PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS BY 3M LABORATORIES.

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE.

THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES DIRECT COSTS OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES USED IN THE

DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE. AMOUNTS CAPITALIZED ARE AMORTIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A PERIOD OF THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND ARE REPORTED AS A

COMPONENT OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT WITHIN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

45

ENVIRONMENTAL.

ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXISTING CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO

NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE REVENUES ARE EXPENSED. LIABILITIES FOR

REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE

AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY

STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION. ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE

OPERATIONS GENERALLY ARE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES.

INCOME TAXES.

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY

APPROACH. UNDER THIS APPROACH, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES REPRESENT THE EXPECTED

FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS

AND TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION

ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THEIR

RELIABILITY EXISTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, NO VALUATION ALLOWANCES WERE

RECORDED.

EARNINGS PER

SHARE.

THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE

SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR CALCULATING BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DILUTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION PLANS. CERTAIN MANAGEMENT STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM AVERAGE OPTIONS

OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEARS 2004, 2003 AND 2002 WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE

COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A

DILUTIVE EFFECT (6.6 MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR 2004, 6.4 MILLION AVERAGE

OPTIONS FOR 2003 AND 11.0 MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR 2002). AS DISCUSSED IN

NOTE 9 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION

RELATED TO THE COMPANYS $639 MILLION IN AGGREGATE FACE AMOUNT OF CONVERTIBLE

NOTES HAVE NEVER BEEN MET; ACCORDINGLY, THERE WAS NO IMPACT ON 3MS DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE. IF THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, 3M MAY CHOOSE TO

PAY IN CASH AND/OR COMMON STOCK; HOWEVER, IF THIS OCCURS, THE COMPANY HAS THE

INTENT AND ABILITY TO SETTLE THIS DEBT SECURITY IN CASH. THE COMPUTATIONS FOR BASIC AND DILUTED

EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31 FOLLOW.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND THE COMPONENTS OF ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IS COMPOSED OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EFFECTS

(INCLUDING HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES), MINIMUM

PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENTS, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

ON CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES.

ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED ON THE

BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY

SWAPS, AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED

WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY MARKET VOLATILITY. ALL

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. IF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED

TRANSACTION CEASES TO EXIST, ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED

DERIVATIVES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

INSTRUMENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH

CHANGES RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND IS NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED

DERIVATIVES.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB

ISSUED AND SUBSEQUENTLY REVISED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 46 (FIN 46),

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES.

THIS INTERPRETATION ADDRESSES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR BUSINESS ENTERPRISES

TO CONSOLIDATE RELATED ENTITIES IN WHICH THEY ARE DETERMINED TO BE THE PRIMARY

ECONOMIC BENEFICIARY AS A RESULT OF THEIR VARIABLE ECONOMIC INTERESTS. THE

INTERPRETATION PROVIDES GUIDANCE IN EVALUATING MULTIPLE ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN

AN ENTITY AND IN DETERMINING THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2004, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FIN 46. THE COMPANY REVIEWED ITS MAJOR COMMERCIAL

RELATIONSHIPS AND ITS OVERALL ECONOMIC INTERESTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES,

CONSISTING OF RELATED PARTIES, CONTRACTED MANUFACTURING VENDORS, COMPANIES IN

WHICH IT HAS AN EQUITY POSITION, AND OTHER SUPPLIERS TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF

ITS VARIABLE ECONOMIC INTERESTS IN THESE PARTIES. AS A RESULT OF THIS REVIEW,

3M IDENTIFIED SEVERAL IMMATERIAL MANUFACTURING-SUPPLIER ARRANGEMENTS THAT HAD

CERTAIN VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITY CHARACTERISTICS. 3M HAS CONCLUDED THAT IT IS

NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY IN ANY OF THESE RELATIONSHIPS AND, THEREFORE, HAS

NOT CONSOLIDATED ANY OF THESE ENTITIES. 3M DOES NOT HAVE ANY MATERIAL EXPOSURE

TO THESE ENTITIES THAT WOULD REQUIRE DISCLOSURE. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD

DID NOT IMPACT 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ON DECEMBER 8, 2003, THE

MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE

MEDICARE ACT) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. REFER TO NOTE 11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DISCUSSION OF THE MEDICARE ACT.

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, THE

FASBS EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE FINALIZED EITF ISSUE NO. 04-08, THE EFFECT

OF CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT ON DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE THAT WOULD

REQUIRE THE DILUTIVE EFFECT OF SHARES FROM CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT TO BE

INCLUDED IN THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

THE CONTINGENCY HAS BEEN MET. THE COMPANY HAS $639 MILLION IN AGGREGATE FACE

AMOUNT OF 30-YEAR ZERO COUPON SENIOR NOTES THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO

APPROXIMATELY 6 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ARE MET.

THESE CONDITIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN MET. THE FASB IS ALSO IN THE PROCESS OF

AMENDING SFAS NO. 128, ANTICIPATED

47

TO BE ISSUED IN 2005,

WHICH IS EXPECTED TO FURTHER ADDRESS THIS AND SEVERAL OTHER ISSUES. UNLESS THE

COMPANY TAKES STEPS TO MODIFY CERTAIN TERMS OF THIS DEBT SECURITY, EITF ISSUE

NO. 04-08 AND PROPOSED SFAS NO. 128R (WHEN EFFECTIVE), WOULD RESULT IN AN

INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 6 MILLION SHARES TO DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING TO

GIVE EFFECT TO THE CONTINGENT ISSUANCE OF SHARES. ALSO, USING THE IF-CONVERTED

METHOD, NET INCOME FOR THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS WOULD BE

ADJUSTED FOR INTEREST EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS DEBT INSTRUMENT. EITF ISSUE

NO. 04-08 WOULD HAVE BEEN EFFECTIVE BEGINNING WITH THE COMPANYS 2004 FOURTH

QUARTER. HOWEVER, DUE TO THE FASBS DELAY IN ISSUING SFAS NO. 128R AND THE

COMPANYS INTENT AND ABILITY TO SETTLE THIS DEBT SECURITY IN CASH VERSUS THE

ISSUANCE OF STOCK, THE IMPACT OF THE ADDITIONAL DILUTED SHARES WILL NOT BE

INCLUDED IN THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATION UNTIL SFAS NO. 128R IS

EFFECTIVE. PRIOR PERIODS DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER

SHARE AMOUNTS WILL BE RESTATED TO PRESENT COMPARABLE INFORMATION WHEN SFAS NO.

128R IS EFFECTIVE. THE ESTIMATED ANNUAL REDUCTION IN 3MS DILUTED EARNINGS PER

SHARE WOULD HAVE BEEN APPROXIMATELY $.02 PER SHARE FOR TOTAL YEAR 2004. BECAUSE

THE IMPACT OF THIS STANDARD IS ONGOING, 3MS DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING AND

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AMOUNTS WOULD BE IMPACTED UNTIL RETIREMENT OR

MODIFICATION OF CERTAIN TERMS OF THIS DEBT SECURITY.

IN NOVEMBER 2004,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 151, INVENTORY COSTS  AN AMENDMENT OF ARB

NO. 43, CHAPTER 4. SFAS NO. 151 AMENDS THE GUIDANCE IN

ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN (ARB) NO. 43, CHAPTER 4, INVENTORY

PRICING, TO CLARIFY THE ACCOUNTING FOR ABNORMAL AMOUNTS OF IDLE FACILITY

EXPENSE, FREIGHT, HANDLING COSTS, AND WASTED MATERIAL (SPOILAGE). AMONG OTHER

PROVISIONS, THE NEW RULE REQUIRES THAT ITEMS SUCH AS IDLE FACILITY EXPENSE,

EXCESSIVE SPOILAGE, DOUBLE FREIGHT, AND REHANDLING COSTS BE RECOGNIZED AS CURRENT-PERIOD

CHARGES REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEY MEET THE CRITERION OF SO ABNORMAL AS

STATED IN ARB NO. 43. ADDITIONALLY, SFAS NO. 151 REQUIRES THAT THE

ALLOCATION OF FIXED PRODUCTION OVERHEADS TO THE COSTS OF CONVERSION BE BASED ON

THE NORMAL CAPACITY OF THE PRODUCTION FACILITIES. SFAS NO. 151 IS

EFFECTIVE FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2005, AND IS REQUIRED

TO BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006. THE COMPANY DOES NOT

EXPECT SFAS NO. 151 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN DECEMBER 2004,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 153, EXCHANGES OF NONMONETARY ASSETS  AN

AMENDMENT OF APB OPINION NO. 29. SFAS NO. 153 ELIMINATES THE EXCEPTION

FROM FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT FOR NONMONETARY EXCHANGES OF SIMILAR PRODUCTIVE

ASSETS IN PARAGRAPH 21(B) OF APB OPINION NO. 29, ACCOUNTING FOR

NONMONETARY TRANSACTIONS, AND REPLACES IT WITH AN EXCEPTION FOR EXCHANGES THAT

DO NOT HAVE COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE. SFAS NO 153 SPECIFIES THAT A NONMONETARY

EXCHANGE HAS COMMERCIAL SUBSTANCE IF THE FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE ENTITY ARE

EXPECTED TO CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY AS A RESULT OF THE EXCHANGE. SFAS NO. 153

IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FISCAL PERIODS BEGINNING AFTER JUNE 15, 2005, AND IS

REQUIRED TO BE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT EXPECT SFAS NO. 153 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE

FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004), SHARE-BASED PAYMENT. SFAS NO. 123R

SUPERSEDES APB OPINION NO. 25, WHICH REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF AN EXPENSE WHEN

GOODS OR SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. SFAS NO. 123R REQUIRES THE DETERMINATION OF THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AT THE GRANT DATE AND THE

RECOGNITION OF THE RELATED EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION VESTS. SFAS NO. 123R PERMITS A PROSPECTIVE OR TWO MODIFIED

VERSIONS OF RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION UNDER WHICH FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

PRIOR PERIODS ARE ADJUSTED ON A BASIS CONSISTENT WITH THE PRO FORMA DISCLOSURES

REQUIRED FOR THOSE PERIODS BY THE ORIGINAL SFAS NO. 123. THE COMPANY IS

REQUIRED TO ADOPT THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123R EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2005, AT

WHICH TIME THE COMPANY WILL BEGIN RECOGNIZING AN EXPENSE FOR UNVESTED SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION THAT HAS BEEN ISSUED OR WILL BE ISSUED AFTER THAT DATE. UNDER THE

RETROACTIVE OPTIONS, PRIOR PERIODS MAY BE RESTATED EITHER AS OF THE BEGINNING

OF THE YEAR OF ADOPTION, JANUARY 1, 2005 FOR THE COMPANY, OR FOR ALL PERIODS

PRESENTED. THE COMPANY HAS NOT YET FINALIZED ITS DECISION CONCERNING THE

TRANSITION OPTION IT WILL UTILIZE TO ADOPT SFAS NO. 123R. THE COMPANYS

MANAGEMENT STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM (MSOP) IS A THREE-YEAR PLAN THAT REQUIRES

SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL AT THE MAY 2005 ANNUAL SHAREHOLDER MEETING. THE COMPANY IS

CONSIDERING VARIOUS CHANGES THAT WILL BE DETAILED IN THE COMPANYS DEFINITIVE

PROXY STATEMENT, BUT WILL NOT BE FINALIZED UNTIL APPROVAL HAS BEEN GRANTED BY

THE COMPANYS SHAREHOLDERS. THE COMPANY DOES EXPECT THE IMPACT OF THE ADOPTION

OF SFAS NO. 123R TO BE MATERIAL, BUT DUE TO POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE MSOP,

FUTURE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AMOUNTS MAY DIFFER FROM THE PRO FORMA AMOUNTS

DISCLOSED EARLIER IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2004,

THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) NO. 109-2, ACCOUNTING AND

DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE FOR THE FOREIGN EARNINGS REPATRIATION PROVISION WITHIN THE

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004, WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE UNDER SFAS

NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, WITH RESPECT TO RECORDING THE

POTENTIAL IMPACT OF THE REPATRIATION PROVISIONS OF THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION

ACT OF 2004 (THE JOBS ACT) ON ENTERPRISES INCOME TAX EXPENSE AND DEFERRED TAX

LIABILITY. THE JOBS ACT WAS ENACTED ON OCTOBER 22, 2004. THE JOBS ACT

CREATES A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. CORPORATIONS TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED

INCOME EARNED ABROAD BY PROVIDING AN 85% DIVIDENDS RECEIVED DEDUCTION FOR

CERTAIN DIVIDENDS FROM CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATIONS. FSP NO. 109-2 STATES

THAT

48

AN ENTERPRISE IS ALLOWED

TIME BEYOND THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PERIOD OF ENACTMENT TO EVALUATE THE EFFECT

OF THE JOBS ACT ON ITS PLAN FOR REINVESTMENT OR REPATRIATION OF FOREIGN

EARNINGS FOR PURPOSES OF APPLYING SFAS NO. 109. THE DEDUCTION IS SUBJECT

TO A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS AND UNCERTAINTY REMAINS AS TO HOW TO INTERPRET

CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN THE ACT. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY IS NOT YET IN A POSITION TO

DECIDE WHETHER, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, THE COMPANY MIGHT REPATRIATE FOREIGN

EARNINGS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN REMITTED TO THE U.S. AND, AS PROVIDED FOR IN

FSP NO. 109-2, THE COMPANY HAS NOT ADJUSTED ITS TAX EXPENSE OR DEFERRED TAX

LIABILITY TO REFLECT THE REPATRIATION PROVISIONS OF THE JOBS ACT. BASED ON THE

COMPANYS ANALYSIS TO DATE, HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL

REPATRIATE AN AMOUNT TOTALING BETWEEN $800 MILLION AND $950 MILLION, WITH THE

RESPECTIVE TAX LIABILITY RANGING FROM $40 MILLION TO $50 MILLION. THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE IN A POSITION TO FINALIZE ITS ASSESSMENT AFTER ISSUANCE

OF FURTHER REGULATORY GUIDANCE AND PASSAGE OF STATUTORY TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS.

GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

3M HAS 18 REPORTING UNITS UNDER THE CRITERIA SET FORTH

BY SFAS NO. 142. SFAS NO. 142 REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT

AT LEAST ANNUALLY AND WHEN REPORTING UNITS ARE CHANGED. THE COMPANY COMPLETED

ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 AND

DETERMINED THAT NO GOODWILL WAS IMPAIRED.

PURCHASED

GOODWILL FROM ACQUISITIONS TOTALED $141 MILLION IN 2004, NONE OF WHICH IS

DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. GOODWILL WAS REDUCED BY $13 MILLION AS A RESULT OF

THE CORNING INCORPORATED SETTLEMENT. THE INCREASE IN THE GOODWILL BALANCE IN

2004 PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE 2004 BUSINESS COMBINATIONS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED

AND CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES DURING THE PERIOD.

NOTE 4

.  2001/2002 CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM

DURING THE FIRST HALF OF

2001, THE COMPANY DEVELOPED AND ANNOUNCED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN THAT

CONSOLIDATED CERTAIN OPERATIONS AND STREAMLINED THE ORGANIZATION TO INCREASE

SPEED AND PRODUCTIVITY. IN JUNE 2001, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE IDENTIFICATION

OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN AND OBTAINED APPROVALS FROM THE

APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001, THE COMPANY

OBTAINED APPROVALS FOR CERTAIN ADDITIONAL ACTIONS. THESE ACTIONS WERE

SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED BY JUNE 30, 2002.

DURING 2001, 3M INCURRED

$569 MILLION OF PRE-TAX EXPENSES PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN.

THE 2001 CHARGES RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFITS ($472 MILLION),

ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION ($80 MILLION) AND OTHER ($17 MILLION). IN THE FIRST

SIX MONTHS OF 2002, 3M INCURRED $202 MILLION OF PRE-TAX EXPENSE RELATING TO THE

RESTRUCTURING PLAN. THE 2002 CHARGES RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFITS

($111 MILLION), ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION ($47 MILLION) AND OTHER ($44

MILLION).

THE SEVERANCE CHARGES

WERE TAKEN IN THE QUARTER WHEN MANAGEMENT APPROVED THE PLANS AND AFTER

SEVERANCE BENEFITS HAD BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE EMPLOYEES. THE ACCELERATED

DEPRECIATION (INCREMENTAL CHARGES RESULTING FROM SHORTENED DEPRECIABLE LIVES,

PRIMARILY RELATED TO DOWNSIZING OR CONSOLIDATING MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS)

RELATED TO ASSETS INCLUDED IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT. ESTIMATED SALVAGE

VALUES WERE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF PROCEEDS UPON SALE OF CERTAIN AFFECTED

ASSETS. THE CHARGES RELATED TO OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES INCLUDED INCREMENTAL COSTS

AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR ITEMS SUCH AS LEASE TERMINATION PAYMENTS AND

OTHER FACILITY EXIT COSTS (SUCH AS DEMOLITION OF BUILDINGS, INVENTORY

DISPOSALS, OTHER) INCURRED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THIS PLAN.

IN CONNECTION WITH ITS

RESTRUCTURING PLAN, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED A TOTAL OF ABOUT 6,900 POSITIONS.

THESE POSITIONS REPRESENTED A WIDE RANGE OF FUNCTIONS THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY.

OF THE 6,900 EMPLOYMENT REDUCTIONS, ABOUT 45% OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES,

30% IN EUROPE AND THE BALANCE IN OTHER INTERNATIONAL AREAS. ALL BUSINESS

SEGMENTS WERE IMPACTED DIRECTLY AND ALSO INDIRECTLY THROUGH REDUCED ALLOCATIONS

OF CORPORATE STAFF SERVICE COSTS. IN ORDER TO ENHANCE SEGMENT COMPARABILITY AND

REFLECT MANAGEMENTS FOCUS ON ONGOING OPERATIONS, THESE RESTRUCTURING COSTS

WERE RECORDED IN CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED, NOT IN THE INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS

SEGMENTS.

SPECIAL TERMINATION

PENSION AND MEDICAL BENEFITS, AGGREGATING $43 MILLION IN 2002 AND $62 MILLION

IN 2001, WERE OFFERED TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. CERTAIN PENSION AND MEDICAL

BENEFITS WILL GENERALLY BE PAID OVER THEIR LIFE EXPECTANCIES.  THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDED $3 MILLION OF

NON-CASH STOCK OPTION EXPENSE IN 2002 ($8 MILLION IN 2001) DUE TO THE

53

RECLASSIFICATION OF

CERTAIN EMPLOYEES AGE 50 AND OLDER TO RETIREE STATUS, RESULTING IN A

MODIFICATION OF THEIR ORIGINAL STOCK OPTION AWARDS FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. THE

CURRENT LIABILITIES AND A PORTION OF THE NON-CURRENT LIABILITIES WERE FUNDED

THROUGH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS, WHILE FUNDING FOR CERTAIN LONG-TERM

SPECIAL TERMINATION PENSION AND MEDICAL LIABILITIES ARE PROVIDED THROUGH

ESTABLISHED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT TRUST FUNDS. THE MAJORITY OF THE

LONG-TERM PORTION OF THE LIABILITY, PRIMARILY SPECIAL TERMINATION PENSION AND

MEDICAL LIABILITIES, IS REFLECTED AS A COMPONENT OF 3MS PENSION AND MEDICAL

TRUST PLANS AS A PORTION OF THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION (ABO). IT IS

ESTIMATED THAT 3MS BENEFIT PLANS REFLECT APPROXIMATELY $24 MILLION OF

RESTRUCTURING-RELATED LONG-TERM LIABILITIES THAT HAD NOT YET BEEN PAID OUT BY

THE TRUSTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. THIS AMOUNT IS REDUCED GRADUALLY OVER TIME

AS THE TRUST FUNDS MAKE PAYMENTS.

THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN

INCLUDED ACTIONS IN 25 LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, 27 IN EUROPE, EIGHT IN

THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA, 13 IN LATIN AMERICA AND FOUR IN CANADA. THE COMPANY DID

NOT DISCONTINUE ANY MAJOR PRODUCT LINES AS A RESULT OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN.

THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES DID NOT INCLUDE ANY WRITE-DOWN OF GOODWILL OR OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

THE MINIMUM PENSION

LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT IS CALCULATED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IF THE ACCUMULATED

BENEFIT OBLIGATION (ABO) EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF PENSION ASSETS, THE EMPLOYER

MUST RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY THAT IS AT LEAST EQUAL TO THE UNFUNDED ABO. FOR THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE CHANGE IN THE MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY

WITHIN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INCREASED STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY BY

$1.193 BILLION (AFTER-TAX). THIS INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY THE RESULT OF THE

ASSETS BEING ABOVE THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR THE U.S.

56

QUALIFIED PLAN, WHICH

CAUSED THE MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY RECORDED FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2003 AND 2002 TO BE REVERSED. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003, 3M RECORDED A

MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $173

MILLION (NET OF TAX), COMPARED WITH $1.056 BILLION (NET OF TAX) IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2002.

INCOME TAX EFFECTS FOR

CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE NO TAX PROVISION HAS BEEN

MADE FOR THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INTO U.S.

DOLLARS. RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE TO AVOID DOUBLE COUNTING IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, THE COMPANY MADE A $300 MILLION TAX DEDUCTIBLE

CONTRIBUTION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN COMPARED WITH A $600 MILLION

TAX DEDUCTIBLE CONTRIBUTION IN 2003 AND A $789 MILLION TAX DEDUCTIBLE

CONTRIBUTION IN 2002. THE COMPANY ALSO MADE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO CERTAIN

INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002. THE CURRENT INCOME TAX

PROVISION INCLUDES A BENEFIT FOR THE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS; THE DEFERRED TAX

PROVISION INCLUDES A COST FOR THE RELATED TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE. ALSO IN 2004,

THE COMPANY REVERSED A MAJORITY OF THE MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY, WHICH WAS

INITIALLY RECORDED IN 2002. THE CHANGE IN THE YEAR-END DEFERRED TAX BALANCE

INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF REVERSING THIS MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY IN ADDITION TO

THE ANNUAL PROVISION FOR DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

ANNUAL

TAX PROVISIONS INCLUDE AMOUNTS CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT TO PAY ASSESSMENTS THAT

MAY RESULT FROM EXAMINATION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX RETURNS; HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT

ULTIMATELY PAID UPON RESOLUTION OF ISSUES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE AMOUNT

ACCRUED.

AS

A RESULT OF CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT COMMITMENTS AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MADE BY 3M,

INCOME FROM MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES IS SUBJECT TO REDUCED

TAX RATES OR, IN SOME CASES, IS EXEMPT FROM TAX FOR YEARS THROUGH 2012. THE

INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TAX STATUS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE

ESTIMATED TO BE $32 MILLION (4 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2004, $34

MILLION (4 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2003 AND $27 MILLION (3 CENTS PER

DILUTED SHARE) IN 2002.

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004, THE

PRESIDENT SIGNED THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE JOBS ACT). THE

JOBS ACT PROVIDES A DEDUCTION FOR INCOME FROM QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PRODUCTION

ACTIVITIES, WHICH WILL BE PHASED IN FROM 2005 THROUGH 2010. IN RETURN, THE ACT

ALSO PROVIDES FOR A TWO-YEAR PHASE-OUT OF THE EXISTING EXTRA-TERRITORIAL INCOME

EXCLUSION (ETI) FOR FOREIGN SALES THAT WAS VIEWED TO BE INCONSISTENT WITH

INTERNATIONAL TRADE PROTOCOLS BY THE EUROPEAN UNION. UNCERTAINTY REMAINS AS TO

HOW TO INTERPRET NUMEROUS PROVISIONS IN THE JOBS ACT. AT THIS TIME, THE COMPANY

DOES NOT EXPECT THE NET EFFECT OF THE PHASE-OUT OF THE ETI AND THE PHASE-IN OF

THIS NEW DEDUCTION TO MATERIALLY IMPACT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR 2005 AND

2006.

UNDER THE GUIDANCE IN

FASB STAFF POSITION NO. FAS 109-1, APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR

INCOME TAXES, TO THE TAX DEDUCTION ON QUALIFIED PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES PROVIDED

BY THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004, THE DEDUCTION WILL BE TREATED AS A

SPECIAL DEDUCTION AS DESCRIBED IN SFAS NO. 109. AS SUCH, THE SPECIAL

DEDUCTION HAS NO EFFECT ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES EXISTING AT THE

ENACTMENT DATE. RATHER, THE IMPACT OF THIS DEDUCTION WILL BE REPORTED IN THE

PERIOD IN WHICH THE DEDUCTION IS CLAIMED ON THE COMPANYS TAX RETURN.

IN ADDITION TO THE

DEDUCTION FOR INCOME FROM QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, THE JOBS

ACT ALSO CREATES A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. CORPORATIONS TO REPATRIATE

ACCUMULATED INCOME EARNED ABROAD BY PROVIDING AN 85 PERCENT DIVIDENDS RECEIVED

DEDUCTION FOR CERTAIN DIVIDENDS FROM CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATIONS. THE

DEDUCTION IS SUBJECT TO A NUMBER OF LIMITATIONS AND UNCERTAINTY REMAINS AS TO

HOW TO INTERPRET CERTAIN PROVISIONS IN THE JOBS ACT. AS SUCH, THE COMPANY IS

NOT YET IN A POSITION TO DECIDE WHETHER, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, IT MIGHT

REPATRIATE FOREIGN EARNINGS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN REMITTED TO THE U.S. BASED

ON THE COMPANYS ANALYSIS TO DATE, HOWEVER, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE COMPANY

WILL REPATRIATE AN AMOUNT TOTALING BETWEEN $800 MILLION AND $950 MILLION, WITH

THE RESPECTIVE TAX LIABILITY RANGING FROM $40 MILLION TO $50 MILLION. THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE IN A POSITION TO FINALIZE ITS ASSESSMENT AFTER ISSUANCE

OF FURTHER REGULATORY GUIDANCE AND PASSAGE OF STATUTORY TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004,

APPROXIMATELY $5.6 BILLION OF UNREMITTED EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO INTERNATIONAL

COMPANIES WAS CONSIDERED TO BE INDEFINITELY INVESTED. THE COMPANYS INTENTION

IS TO REINVEST THE INDEFINITELY INVESTED EARNINGS PERMANENTLY OR TO REPATRIATE

THE EARNINGS WHEN IT IS TAX EFFECTIVE TO DO SO. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO

DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF INCREMENTAL TAXES THAT MIGHT ARISE WERE THESE EARNINGS

TO BE REMITTED. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS

WOULD LARGELY ELIMINATE ANY U.S. TAXES AND OFFSET ANY FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES

DUE ON REMITTANCE. PROVISIONS ARE MADE FOR ESTIMATED U.S. AND FOREIGN INCOMES

TAXES, LESS AVAILABLE TAX CREDITS AND DEDUCTIONS, WHICH MAY BE INCURRED ON THE

REMITTANCE OF THE COMPANYS SHARE OF SUBSIDIARIES UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS NOT

DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED. THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF

LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS

DUE IN 2005 INCLUDE $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES (FINAL

MATURITY 2010), $62 MILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES (FINAL MATURITY 2044), AND

$556 MILLION OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES (FINAL MATURITY 2032). THESE SECURITIES ARE

CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS THE RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. IN ADDITION, PAYMENTS DUE IN 2005

INCLUDE $400 MILLION IN MEDIUM-TERM NOTES AND $37 MILLION RELATED TO THE

ESOP.

THE ESOP DEBT IS SERVICED

BY DIVIDENDS ON STOCK HELD BY THE ESOP AND BY COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS. THESE

CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT REPORTED AS INTEREST EXPENSE, BUT ARE REPORTED AS AN

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. OTHER

BORROWINGS INCLUDES DEBT HELD BY 3MS INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES AND FLOATING RATE

NOTES IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH THE LONG-TERM PORTION OF THIS DEBT PRIMARILY

COMPRISED OF U.S. DOLLAR FLOATING RATE DEBT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, AVAILABLE

SHORT-TERM LINES OF CREDIT GLOBALLY TOTALED ABOUT $618 MILLION, OF WHICH $88

MILLION WAS UTILIZED. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS UNCOMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES TOTALING $637 MILLION. DEBT COVENANTS DO NOT RESTRICT THE

PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

60

IN SEPTEMBER 2003, THE

COMPANY FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE

COMMISSION RELATING TO THE POTENTIAL OFFERING OF DEBT SECURITIES OF UP TO $1.5

BILLION. THIS SHELF REGISTRATION BECAME EFFECTIVE IN OCTOBER 2003. IN DECEMBER

2003, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE SHELF A MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM

THROUGH WHICH UP TO $1.5 BILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MAY BE OFFERED. 3M PLANS

TO USE THE NET PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF DEBT SECURITIES UNDER THIS

REGISTRATION FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT;

INVESTMENTS IN OR EXTENSIONS OF CREDIT TO 3M SUBSIDIARIES; OR THE FINANCING OF

POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS OR BUSINESS EXPANSION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, $62 MILLION

OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES HAD BEEN ISSUED UNDER THE MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM. THE

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM AND SHELF REGISTRATION HAVE REMAINING CAPACITY OF

APPROXIMATELY $1.438 BILLION.

ON

NOVEMBER 15, 2002, 3M SOLD $639 MILLION IN AGGREGATE FACE AMOUNT OF 30-YEAR

ZERO COUPON SENIOR NOTES (THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES) THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO

SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK. THE GROSS PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING, TO BE USED FOR

GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, WERE $550 MILLION ($540 MILLION NET OF ISSUANCE

COSTS). THE BOOK VALUE OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS $556

MILLION. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2003, 3M REGISTERED THESE CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN A

REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THE

TERMS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES INCLUDE A YIELD TO MATURITY OF .50% AND AN

INITIAL CONVERSION PREMIUM OF 40% OVER THE $65.00 (SPLIT-ADJUSTED) CLOSING

PRICE OF 3M COMMON STOCK ON NOVEMBER 14, 2002. IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS FOR

CONVERSION (RELATING TO THE CLOSING COMMON STOCK PRICES OF 3M EXCEEDING THE

CONVERSION TRIGGER PRICE FOR SPECIFIED PERIODS) ARE MET, HOLDERS MAY CONVERT

EACH OF THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES INTO 9.4602 SHARES OF 3M COMMON

STOCK IN ANY CALENDAR QUARTER COMMENCING AFTER MARCH 31, 2003. THE CONVERSION

TRIGGER PRICE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 WAS $119.40 PER SHARE. IF THE

CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, AND 3M ELECTS NOT TO SETTLE IN CASH, THE

30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE IN THE AGGREGATE INTO

APPROXIMATELY 6.0 MILLION SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK. 3M MAY REDEEM THE 30-YEAR

ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES AT ANY TIME IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BEGINNING NOVEMBER

21, 2007, AT THE GREATER OF THE ACCRETED CONVERSION PRICE OR THE CURRENT MARKET

PRICE. HOLDERS OF THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES HAVE THE OPTION TO

REQUIRE 3M TO PURCHASE THEIR NOTES AT ACCRETED VALUE ON NOVEMBER 21 IN THE

YEARS 2005, 2007, 2012, 2017, 2022 AND 2027. 3M MAY CHOOSE TO PAY THE

REDEMPTION PURCHASE PRICE IN CASH AND/OR COMMON STOCK; HOWEVER, IF REDEMPTION

OCCURS, THE COMPANY HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO SETTLE THIS DEBT SECURITY IN

CASH. DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A

THREE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING IN NOVEMBER 2002. THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION

HAVE NEVER BEEN MET; ACCORDINGLY, THERE WAS NO IMPACT ON 3MS DILUTED EARNINGS

PER SHARE. FOR A DISCUSSION OF ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT WILL AFFECT ACCOUNTING

TREATMENT FOR THE CONVERTIBLE NOTE, REFER TO NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR DISCUSSION OF EITF ISSUE NO. 04-08, THE EFFECT OF

CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT ON DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE AND PROPOSED SFAS

NO. 128R, EARNINGS PER SHARE.

IN DECEMBER 2000, THE

COMPANY ISSUED $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE DEBT SECURITIES, WHICH ARE

CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT. THE REMARKETABLE SECURITIES

CAN BE REMARKETED ANNUALLY, AT THE OPTION OF THE DEALER, FOR A YEAR EACH TIME,

WITH A FINAL MATURITY DATE OF DECEMBER 2010. IN DECEMBER 2004, THE COMPANYS

DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE REMARKETED FOR ONE YEAR. THEY WERE REISSUED

WITH A FIXED COUPON RATE OF 5.67%.

NOTE 10

.  DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE

COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS, AND FORWARD AND OPTION

CONTRACTS TO MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE,

INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY MARKET VOLATILITY. THE INFORMATION THAT FOLLOWS

EXPLAINS THE VARIOUS TYPES OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND

INCLUDES A TABLE THAT RECAPS NET INVESTMENT HEDGING AND CASH FLOW HEDGING

AMOUNTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND

OPTION CONTRACTS.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE

FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAPS TO HEDGE AGAINST THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE

RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN

INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH

FLOW HEDGES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY HAD VARIOUS OPEN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAD MATURITIES OF

ONE YEAR OR LESS. THE AMOUNTS AT RISK ARE NOT MATERIAL BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS

THE ABILITY TO GENERATE OFFSETTING FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS. THE SETTLEMENT

OR EXTENSION OF THESE DERIVATIVES WILL RESULT IN RECLASSIFICATIONS TO EARNINGS

IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS (FROM OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME). THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH 3M IS HEDGING ITS

EXPOSURE TO THE VARIABILITY IN FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR A MAJORITY OF THE

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, EXCLUDING THOSE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO THE

PAYMENT OF VARIABLE INTEREST ON EXISTING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, IS 12 MONTHS.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY CONVERTED A FOREIGN-CURRENCY

BASED PRICING CONTRACT INTO A DOLLAR-BASED PRICING CONTRACT. THIS RESULTED IN

THE DISCONTINUANCE OF CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOW HEDGES. THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZED A $10 MILLION PRE-TAX LOSS (RECORDED IN COST OF SALES) RELATED TO

THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THESE CONTRACTS IN 2002. HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT

MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS 2004, 2003 AND 2002.

61

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES INTEREST EXPENSE USING A MIX OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATE

DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE BORROWING COSTS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE

SWAPS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY AGREES TO EXCHANGE, AT SPECIFIED

INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND FLOATING INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED

BY REFERENCE TO AN AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. THE COMPANY USES

INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS TO MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISK RELATED TO

BORROWINGS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE

COMPANY HAD INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $3 MILLION ($21 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2003) DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF UNDERLYING FIXED RATE

OBLIGATIONS. THE MARK-TO-MARKET OF THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES IS RECORDED AS GAINS

OR LOSSES IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND IS OFFSET BY THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE UNDERLYING

DEBT INSTRUMENT THAT IS ALSO RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. ALL EXISTING FAIR

VALUE HEDGES ARE 100% EFFECTIVE AND, THUS, THERE IS NO IMPACT ON EARNINGS DUE

TO HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS.

AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT,

THE COMPANY ALSO USES CROSS-CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO HEDGE FOREIGN

CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES. AS PART OF THIS STRATEGY, IN SEPTEMBER 2003, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR COMBINED INTEREST

RATE AND CURRENCY SWAP WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $300 MILLION. THIS TRANSACTION

IS A PARTIAL HEDGE OF 3MS NET INVESTMENT IN 3MS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THIS

SWAP CONVERTS A VARIABLE RATE U.S. DOLLAR EXPOSURE TO A VARIABLE RATE

YEN-DENOMINATED EXPOSURE.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGING.

AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY DEBT AND FORWARDS

TO HEDGE PORTIONS OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. FOR

HEDGES THAT MEET THE EFFECTIVENESS REQUIREMENTS, THE NET GAINS OR LOSSES ARE

RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WITH ANY

INEFFECTIVENESS RECORDED IN COST OF SALES. HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT

MATERIAL IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002.

COMMODITY PRICE MANAGEMENT.

THE

COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS,

PRICE PROTECTION SWAPS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY USES

COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS TO MANAGE

PRICE VOLATILITY. THE RELATED MARK-TO-MARKET GAIN OR LOSS ON QUALIFYING HEDGES

IS INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE (TYPICALLY

100% EFFECTIVE), AND RECLASSIFIED INTO COST OF SALES IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH

THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. 3M HAS HEDGED ITS EXPOSURE TO THE

VARIABILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS THROUGH

2005. NO SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY CASH FLOW HEDGES WERE DISCONTINUED DURING THE

YEARS 2004, 2003 AND 2002.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGING AND CASH

FLOW HEDGING.

AMOUNTS RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION RELATED TO NET INVESTMENT

HEDGING, AND CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENT DISCLOSURES FOLLOW. RECLASSIFICATION

ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE TO AVOID DOUBLE COUNTING IN COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS

THAT ARE ALSO INCLUDED AS PART OF NET INCOME. THE AMOUNT OF THE

RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENT RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS EQUAL

TO, BUT OPPOSITE IN SIGN FROM, THE AMOUNT OF THE REALIZED GAIN OR LOSS IN NET

INCOME.

BASED ON EXCHANGE RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECLASSIFY

TO EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS A MAJORITY OF THE CASH FLOW HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $42 MILLION (WITH THE IMPACT LARGELY OFFSET BY

FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS FROM UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEMS).

CURRENCY

EFFECTS.

3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR CURRENCY EFFECTS,

INCLUDING HEDGING IMPACTS, INCREASED NET INCOME BY $181 MILLION IN 2004 AND $73

MILLION IN 2003, AND REDUCED NET INCOME BY $35 MILLION IN 2002. THIS ESTIMATE

INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF TRANSLATING PROFITS FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S.

DOLLARS; THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF GOODS BETWEEN

3M OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD; AND TRANSACTION GAINS AND

LOSSES, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATE RISKS. 3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR DERIVATIVE AND OTHER

TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES INCREASED NET INCOME BY $48 MILLION IN 2004,

BENEFITING FROM LOWER YEAR-ON-YEAR HEDGING LOSSES. 3M ESTIMATES THAT

YEAR-ON-YEAR DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES DECREASED NET

INCOME BY $73 MILLION IN 2003 AND $25 MILLION IN 2002.

CREDIT RISK.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY

COUNTERPARTIES IN INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS, AND OPTION AND FOREIGN

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS RISK IS LIMITED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK

THROUGH THE USE OF CREDIT APPROVALS AND CREDIT LIMITS, AND BY SELECTING MAJOR

INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE,

BORROWING, AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT (EXCEPT THE $350 MILLION DEALER

REMARKETABLE SECURITY AND CONVERTIBLE NOTE) APPROXIMATED CARRYING VALUES

BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUES

FOR INVESTMENTS HELD AT COST ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE, BUT ARE ESTIMATED TO

APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE. THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF OTHER

.  PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

3M

HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S.

EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENSION BENEFITS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF

SERVICE, COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IN ADDITION TO

PROVIDING PENSION BENEFITS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES CERTAIN POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH

CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS U.S. EMPLOYEES

WHO REACH RETIREMENT AGE WHILE EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. MOST INTERNATIONAL EMPLOYEES

AND RETIREES ARE COVERED BY GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. THE COST OF

COMPANY-PROVIDED POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE PLANS FOR INTERNATIONAL EMPLOYEES

IS NOT MATERIAL AND IS COMBINED WITH U.S. AMOUNTS.

ON DECEMBER 8, 2003, THE

MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 (THE

MEDICARE ACT) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW. THE ACT EXPANDS MEDICARE TO INCLUDE

COVERAGE FOR PRESCRIPTION DRUGS. 3M SPONSORS MEDICAL PROGRAMS, INCLUDING

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COVERAGE FOR U.S. RETIREES. ON MAY 19, 2004, THE FASB

ISSUED FSP NO. 106-2, ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO THE

MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003, WHICH

REQUIRES CURRENT RECOGNITION OF THE FEDERAL SUBSIDY THAT EMPLOYERS MAY RECEIVE

FOR PROVIDING DRUG COVERAGE TO RETIREES. FSP NO. 106-2 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR

THE COMPANY JULY 1, 2004. THE COMPANY REMEASURED ITS PLANS ASSETS AND

ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION (APBO) AS OF JUNE 30, 2004 TO

INCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF THE MEDICARE ACT. THE MEDICARE ACT REDUCED THE APBO

BY $240 MILLION, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE TO THE APBO OF $170

MILLION AS A RESULT OF THE PLAN REMEASUREMENT. THE NET IMPACT TO THE APBO

WAS A REDUCTION OF $70 MILLION. THE REMEASUREMENT, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF

THE MEDICARE ACT, REDUCED EXPENSE BY $8 MILLION FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 2004.

THE

COMPANYS PENSION FUNDING POLICY IS TO DEPOSIT WITH INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES

AMOUNTS ALLOWABLE BY LAW. TRUST FUNDS AND DEPOSITS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

MAINTAINED TO PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR

BENEFICIARIES. THERE ARE NO PLAN ASSETS IN THE NON-QUALIFIED PLAN DUE TO ITS

NATURE. FOR ITS U.S. POSTRETIREMENT PLAN, THE COMPANY HAS SET ASIDE AMOUNTS AT

LEAST EQUAL TO ANNUAL BENEFIT PAYMENTS WITH AN INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED

IN THE COMPANYS JUNE 30, 2004 AND SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 FORM 10-QS, IN 2004, THE

COMPANYS U.S. PLAN MEASUREMENT DATE WAS CHANGED FROM SEPTEMBER 30 TO DECEMBER

31. INFORMATION

63

PRESENTED IN THE TABLES

FOR U.S. PLANS FOR 2004 REFLECTS A MEASUREMENT DATE OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND

SEPTEMBER 30 FOR 2003 AND 2002. THE PRIMARY REASONS FOR THIS CHANGE INCLUDE

CONSISTENCY BETWEEN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL DATES, THE INCREASED CLARITY

THAT RESULTS FROM HAVING THE SAME MEASUREMENT AND BALANCE SHEET DATES, AND

ADMINISTRATIVE SIMPLIFICATION. THIS CHANGE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON

THE DETERMINATION OF PERIODIC PENSION COST OR PENSION OBLIGATIONS.

3MS

INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IS TO MANAGE THE

PLANS ON A GOING-CONCERN BASIS. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE FUNDS IS TO MEET THE

OBLIGATIONS AS REQUIRED. THE SECONDARY GOAL IS TO EARN THE HIGHEST RATE OF

RETURN POSSIBLE, WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING ITS PRIMARY GOAL, AND WITHOUT SUBJECTING

THE COMPANY TO AN UNDUE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTION RATE VOLATILITY. FUND RETURNS

ARE USED TO HELP FINANCE PRESENT AND FUTURE OBLIGATIONS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE

WITHIN ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED FUNDING LIMITS AND TAX-DETERMINED ASSET LIMITS,

THUS REDUCING THE LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTIONS 3M MUST MAKE.

3M

DOES NOT BUY OR SELL ANY OF ITS OWN STOCK AS A DIRECT INVESTMENT FOR ITS

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT FUNDS. HOWEVER, DUE TO EXTERNAL

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT OF THE FUNDS, THE PLANS MAY INDIRECTLY BUY, SELL OR HOLD

3M STOCK. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE SHARES WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE

MATERIAL RELATIVE TO THE AGGREGATE FUND PERCENTAGES.

FOR THE U.S. PENSION

PLAN, THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 9.0%

IN 2004. IN DEVELOPING THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTION, THE

COMPANY IS PROVIDED PROJECTED RETURNS BY ASSET CLASS FROM ITS PENSION

INVESTMENT ADVISORS. PROJECTED RETURNS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON BROAD, PUBLICLY

TRADED EQUITY AND FIXED-INCOME INDICES AND FORWARD-LOOKING ESTIMATES OF ACTIVE

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. THE COMPANYS EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S.

PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON AN ASSET ALLOCATION ASSUMPTION OF 44% U.S. AND 15%

INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, WITH AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF 7.5% FOR

BOTH U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES; 13% PRIVATE EQUITIES WITH AN EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF 12.5%; 28% FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES WITH AN EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF 5.0%; AND AN ADDITIONAL RATE OF RETURN OF 1.5% FROM

ACTIVE INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSUMPTIONS RESULT IN A 9.0% WEIGHTED

AVERAGE RATE OF RETURN ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. THE PLAN ASSETS EARNED A RATE OF

RETURN IN EXCESS OF 13% AND 18% IN 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY, AND

SUBSTANTIALLY LESS THAN 9% IN 2002. THE AVERAGE ANNUAL ACTUAL RETURN ON THE

PLAN ASSETS OVER THE PAST 10 AND 25 YEARS HAS BEEN 11.7% AND 12.5%,

RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY IS LOWERING THE 2005 EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS

BY 0.25 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 8.75%.

3M MADE A THIRD QUARTER 2004 SPECIAL PENSION

CONTRIBUTION OF $300 MILLION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. ALSO, IN THE

THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, 3M MADE A PLAN DESIGN CHANGE TO ITS SUMITOMO 3M JAPANESE

PENSION PLAN THAT CHANGED THE DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN TO A HYBRID DEFINED CONTRIBUTION

AND CASH BALANCE PLAN. PRIOR TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PLAN DESIGN CHANGE,

JAPANESE PENSION VALUATION METHODS REQUIRED 3M TO BRING THE PLAN TO FULLY

FUNDED STATUS. THIS REQUIRED 3M TO MAKE A THIRD QUARTER 2004 SPECIAL PENSION

CONTRIBUTION OF $155 MILLION. THE PLAN DESIGN CHANGE REDUCED THE LIABILITY BY

APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION. IN ADDITION, DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2005, 3M

INTENDS TO TRANSFER A PORTION OF ITS SUMITOMO 3M JAPANESE PENSION LIABILITIES

AND ASSETS TO THE GOVERNMENT, AS ALLOWED BY A JAPANESE GOVERNMENT PROGRAM. THIS

PROGRAM WOULD ALLOW 3M TO TRANSFER APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION IN PENSION

LIABILITIES AND $80 MILLION IN PENSION ASSETS TO THE JAPANESE GOVERNMENT.

IN

2005, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE AN AMOUNT IN THE RANGE OF $100 MILLION

TO $400 MILLION TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS, AND APPROXIMATELY

$150 MILLION TO ITS POST-RETIREMENT PLANS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED

MINIMUM PENSION CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2005. THEREFORE,

THE AMOUNT OF THE ANTICIPATED DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION COULD VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE U.S. PLANS FUNDING STATUS AS OF THE 2005

MEASUREMENT DATE AND THE ANTICIPATED TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE CONTRIBUTION.

THEREBY GIVING 3M THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO MAINTAIN A PRESENCE IN

A LEASED FACILITY. 3MS PRIMARY CAPITAL LEASE, EFFECTIVE IN APRIL 2003,

INVOLVES A BUILDING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (WITH A LEASE TERM OF 22 YEARS). DURING

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, 3M RECORDED A CAPITAL LEASE ASSET AND OBLIGATION OF

APPROXIMATELY 33.5 MILLION UNITED KINGDOM POUNDS (APPROXIMATELY $64 MILLION AT

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

THE COMPANY SPONSORS EMPLOYEE

SAVINGS PLANS UNDER SECTION 401(K) OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THESE PLANS

ARE OFFERED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL REGULAR U.S. EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS

OF UP TO 6% OF COMPENSATION ARE MATCHED AT RATES RANGING FROM 35% TO 50%, WITH

ADDITIONAL COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS DEPENDING UPON COMPANY PERFORMANCE. ALL

COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS INITIALLY ARE INVESTED IN 3M COMMON STOCK, WITH EMPLOYEE

CONTRIBUTIONS INVESTED IN A NUMBER OF INVESTMENT FUNDS PURSUANT TO THEIR

ELECTIONS. VESTED EMPLOYEES MAY SELL UP TO 50% OF THEIR 3M SHARES AND DIVERSIFY

INTO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN

EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). THIS PLAN WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1989 AS A

COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OF FUNDING THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER

401(K) EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS. TOTAL ESOP SHARES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE SHARES

OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS.

DIVIDENDS ON SHARES HELD

BY THE ESOP ARE PAID TO THE ESOP TRUST AND, TOGETHER WITH COMPANY

CONTRIBUTIONS, ARE USED BY THE ESOP TO REPAY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON THE

OUTSTANDING NOTES. THE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO DIVIDENDS PAID ON UNALLOCATED

SHARES WAS CHARGED DIRECTLY TO EQUITY AND TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $4 MILLION IN

2004, $5 MILLION IN 2003 AND $6 MILLION IN 2002. OVER THE LIFE OF THE NOTES,

SHARES ARE RELEASED FOR ALLOCATION TO PARTICIPANTS BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE

CURRENT YEARS DEBT SERVICE TO THE REMAINING DEBT SERVICE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT

PAYMENT.

68

THE

ESOP HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE SAVINGS

PLANS. AS PERMITTED BY AICPA STATEMENT OF POSITION 93-6, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING

FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO CONTINUE ITS

PRACTICES, WHICH ARE BASED ON STATEMENT OF POSITION 76-3, ACCOUNTING PRACTICES

FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS AND SUBSEQUENT CONSENSUS OF THE

EITF OF THE FASB. ACCORDINGLY, THE DEBT OF THE ESOP IS RECORDED AS DEBT, AND

SHARES PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL ARE REPORTED AS UNEARNED COMPENSATION IN THE CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEET AND CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. UNEARNED COMPENSATION IS REDUCED SYMMETRICALLY AS THE

ESOP MAKES PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON THE DEBT. EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ESOP INCLUDE

TOTAL DEBT SERVICE ON THE NOTES, LESS DIVIDENDS. THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES

TREASURY SHARES, ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, TO EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS TO

COVER OBLIGATIONS NOT FUNDED BY THE ESOP (REPORTED AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

EXPENSE).

3MS BUSINESSES ARE

WORLDWIDE RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCT LINES. 3M IS
