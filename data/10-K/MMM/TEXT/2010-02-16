distribution
3m products are sold
through numerous distribution channels, including directly to users and through
numerous wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in a wide
variety of trades in many countries around the world. management believes the
confidence of wholesalers, retailers, jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3m
and its products  a confidence developed through long association with skilled
marketing and sales representatives  has contributed significantly to 3ms
position in the marketplace and to its growth.
research
and patents
research and product
development constitutes an important part of 3ms activities and has been a
major driver of 3ms sales growth. research, development and related expenses
totaled $1.293 billion in 2009, $1.404 billion in 2008 and $1.368 billion in
2007. research and development, covering basic scientific research and the
application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved
products and their uses, totaled $838 million in 2009, $851 million in 2008 and
$788 million in 2007. related expenses primarily include technical support
provided by 3m to customers who are using existing 3m products; internally
developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file,
secure and maintain patents; and amortization of acquired patents.
the companys products
are sold around the world under various trademarks. the company also owns, or
holds licenses to use, numerous u.s. and foreign patents. the companys
research and development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that
are covered by new patents. patents applicable to specific products extend for
varying periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent
grant and the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent
protection is obtained. the actual protection afforded by a patent, which can
vary
table of
contents
from country to country,
depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage and the availability
of legal remedies in the country.
the company believes that
its patents provide an important competitive advantage in many of its businesses.
in general, no single patent or group of related patents is in itself essential
to the company as a whole or to any of the companys business segments. the
importance of patents in the display and graphics segment is described in performance
by business segment  display and graphics business in partii, item 7,
of this form10-k.
raw materials
in 2009, the company experienced cost decreases in
most raw materials and transportation fuel costs. this was driven by lower
basic feedstock costs, particularly metals and oil derived materials. to date,
the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its
reasonably foreseeable production requirements. it is impossible to predict
future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have.
3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful
management of existing raw material inventories and development and
qualification of additional supply sources. 3m manages commodity price risks
through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward
physical contracts.
environmental law compliance
3ms manufacturing operations are affected by
national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3m has made, and
plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable
laws. 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental
matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to environmental and
other liabilities and insurance receivables in note 14, commitments and
contingencies).
environmental expenditures relating to existing
conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or
future revenues are expensed. reserves for liabilities for anticipated remediation
costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable and
reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility
studies or the companys commitment to a plan of action. environmental
expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future
operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives.
in 2009, 3m expended about $15 million for capital
projects related to protecting the environment. this amount excludes expenditures
for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by past operations
that do not contribute to current or future revenues, which are expensed.
capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included pollution control
devices  such as wastewater treatment plant improvements, scrubbers,
containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers  at new
and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course of
business. consistent with the companys policies stressing environmental
responsibility, capital expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for
known projects are presently expected to be about $22million over the
next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify
manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.
while the company cannot predict with certainty the
future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating
costs for environmental compliance, the company does not believe they will have
a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
position.

item 1a. risk
factors
our disclosure and
analysis in our annual report on form10-k contain forward-looking
statements that relate to future events and typically address the companys
expected future business and financial performance based on certain
assumptions. these assumptions and expectations of future events and trends are
subject to risks and uncertainties. depending on a variety of factors, actual
future results and trends may differ materially from historical results or
those reflected in any such forward-looking statements. provided below is a
cautionary discussion of what we believe to be the most significant risk
factors applicable to the company. discussion of these factors is incorporated
by reference into and considered an integral part of partii, item 7, managements
discussion and analysis of financial conditions and results of operations.
*results are impacted by
the effects of, and changes in, worldwide economic and capital markets
conditions. the
company operates in more than 65 countries and derives approximately 63 percent
of its revenues from outside the united states. the companys business may be
adversely affected by factors in the united states and other countries that are
beyond its control, such as disruptions in financial markets or downturns in
economic activity in specific countries or regions, or in the various
industries in which the company operates; social, political or labor conditions
in specific countries or regions; or adverse changes in the availability and
cost of capital, interest rates, tax rates, or regulations in the jurisdictions
in which the company operates.
*the companys credit
ratings are important to 3ms cost of capital. the major rating agencies routinely evaluate the
companys credit profile and have assigned debt ratings to 3m that are near the
top of the ratings spectrum. this evaluation is based on a number of factors,
which include financial strength, business and financial risk, as well as
transparency with rating agencies and timeliness of financial reporting. the
company has an aa- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from standard&
poors and an aa2 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from moodys investors
service. the companys strong ratings serve to lower 3ms borrowing costs and
facilitate access to a variety of lenders. failure to maintain the current
ratings level could adversely affect the companys cost of funds, liquidity and
access to capital markets.
*the companys results are
affected by competitive conditions and customer preferences. demand for the companys products, which
impacts revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i)the development and
timing of the introduction of competitive products; (ii)the companys
response to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii)changes in
customer order patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained
by customers and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by
announced price changes, changes in the companys incentive programs, or the
customers ability to achieve incentive goals; and (iv)changes in
customers preferences for our products, including the success of products
offered by our competitors, and changes in customer designs for their products
that can affect the demand for some of the companys products.
*foreign currency exchange
rates and fluctuations in those rates may affect the companys ability to
realize projected growth rates in its sales and earnings. because the companys financial
statements are denominated in u.s. dollars and approximately 63 percent of the
companys revenues are derived from outside the united states, the companys
results of operations and its ability to realize projected growth rates in
sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the u.s. dollar strengthens
significantly against foreign currencies.
*the companys growth
objectives are largely dependent on the timing and market acceptance of its new
product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of
new products and to bring those products to market. this ability may be adversely affected
by difficulties or delays in product development, such as the inability to
identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual property protection,
or gain market acceptance of new products. there are no guarantees that new
products will prove to be commercially successful.
*the companys future
results are subject to fluctuations in the costs and availability of purchased
components, compounds, raw materials and energy, including oil and natural gas
and their derivatives, due to shortages, increased demand, supply
interruptions, currency exchange risks, natural disasters and other factors. the company depends on various
components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas
and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its
products. it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be
interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be
terminated in the future. any sustained interruption in the companys receipt
of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company. in
addition, while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component
and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the company will be able
to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or
shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company.
table of
contents
*acquisitions, strategic
alliances, divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio
management actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible
organizational restructuring could affect future results. the company monitors its business
portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue to make
acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its
organizational structure. with respect to acquisitions, future results will be
affected by the companys ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and
obtain the anticipated synergies.
*the companys future
results may be affected if the company generates fewer productivity
improvements than estimated. the company utilizes various tools, such as lean six
sigma, to improve operational efficiency and productivity. there can be no
assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized.
*the companys future
results may be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including
those involving product liability, antitrust, environmental or other matters. the outcome of these legal proceedings
may differ from the companys expectations because the outcomes of litigation,
including regulatory matters, are often difficult to reliably predict. various
factors or developments can lead the company to change current estimates of
liabilities and related insurance receivables where applicable, or make such
estimates for matters previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such
as a significant judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement,
significant regulatory developments or changes in applicable law. a future
adverse ruling, settlement or unfavorable development could result in future
charges that could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of
operations or cash flows in any particular period. for a more detailed
discussion of the legal proceedings involving the company and the associated
accounting estimates, see the discussion in note 14.

3m owns substantially all

above income and earnings per share information exclude a cumulative effect of
accounting change in 2005 ($35million, or 5 cents per diluted share). new
accounting guidance for asset retirement obligations was effective december31,
2005, and its adoption resulted in the recognition of an asset retirement
obligation liability of $59 million at december31, 2005, and an after-tax
charge of $35 million for 2005, which was reflected as a cumulative effect of
change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income.
items
included in the preceding table which had a significant impact on results are
summarized as follows. 2009 results included net losses that decreased
operating income by $194 million and net income attributable to 3m by $119
million. 2009 included restructuring actions ($209 million pre-tax, $128
million after tax and noncontrolling interest), which was partially offset by a
gain on sale of real estate ($15 million pre-tax, $9 million after tax). 2008
results included net losses that decreased operating income by $269 million and
net income attributable to 3m by $194 million. 2008 included restructuring
actions ($229 million pre-tax, $147 million after-tax and noncontrolling
interest), exit activities ($58 million pre-tax, $43 million after-tax) and
losses related to the sale of businesses ($23 million pre-tax, $32 million
after-tax), which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate ($41
million pre-tax, $28 million after-tax). 2007 results included net gains that
increased operating income by $681 million and net income attributable to 3m by
$448 million. 2007 included gains related to the sale of businesses ($849
million pre-tax, $550 million after-tax) and a gain on sale of real estate ($52
million pre-tax, $37 million after-tax), which were partially offset by
increases in environmental liabilities ($134 million pre-tax, $83 million
after-tax), restructuring actions ($41 million pre-tax, $27 million after-tax),
and exit activities ($45 million pre-tax, $29 million after-tax). 2006 results
included net gains that increased operating income by $523 million and net
income attributable to 3m by $438 million. 2006 included net benefits
from gains related to the sale of certain portions of 3ms branded
pharmaceuticals business ($1.074 billion pre-tax, $674 million after-tax) and
favorable income tax adjustments ($149 million), which were partially offset by
restructuring actions ($403 million pre-tax, $257 million after-tax), acquired
in-process research and development expenses ($95 million pre-tax and
after-tax), settlement costs of an antitrust class action ($40 million pre-tax,
$25 million after-tax), and environmental obligations related to the
pharmaceuticals business ($13million pre-tax, $8 million after-tax). 2005
results included charges that reduced net income attributable to 3m before
cumulative effect of accounting change by $75 million. this related to a tax
liability resulting from 3ms reinvestment of approximately $1.7 billion of
foreign earnings in the united states pursuant to the repatriation provisions
of the american jobs creation act of 2004.

overview
3m is a diversified
global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of
products. as discussed in note 17 to the consolidated financial statements,
effective in the first quarter of 2009, 3m made certain business segment
realignments, including both product moves between business segments and
reporting changes related to revised u.s. performance measures. the financial
information presented herein reflects the impact of these changes for all
periods presented. 3m manages its operations in six operating business
segments: industrial and transportation; health care; consumer and office;
safety, security and protection services; display and graphics; and electro and
communications.
3ms quarterly
year-on-year business results got stronger as 2009 progressed, with first
nine-month 2009 year-on-year comparisons significantly negatively impacted by
the economic downturn that began impacting 3m in the fourth quarter of 2008.
for total year 2009, while sales declined 8.5 percent and organic volumes
declined 9.5 percent, worldwide industrial production is expected to be down by
a similar amount and 3ms sales performance was in line with the overall economy.
3m restructured a number of businesses during the year, resulting in 2009 total
year savings of almost $400 million, with estimated additional incremental
savings of more than $150 million in 2010. in addition, 3m amended its policy
regarding banked vacation, which added more than $100 million to operating
income in 2009, with a slightly lower benefit expected in 2010. 3m also enacted
temporary furloughs where appropriate, froze merit pay and reduced indirect
spending. finally, in the midst of this economic downturn, 3m invested $1.3
billion in research, development and related expenses during 2009.
3m has been aggressively
restructuring the company since early 2008 and continued this effort through
the third quarter of 2009, with these restructuring actions and exit activities
in the aggregate resulting in a reduction of approximately 6,400 positions. 3m
aggressively reduced structural costs across the company, including in the
factories. the focus now is to accelerate growth in the various businesses and
to add only those expenses that are absolutely necessary. 3m announced the
reduction of approximately 200 positions in the third quarter of 2009, with the
majority of those occurring in western europe and, to a lesser extent, the
united states. in the second quarter of 2009, 3m permanently reduced
approximately 900 positions spanning many businesses and geographies, and in
the united states another 700 people accepted a voluntary retirement option. 3m
expects that a small portion of those who accepted the voluntary separation
will be replaced; thus, on a net basis, 3m estimates an employment level
decline of approximately 1,400 to 1,500 due to these second quarter
restructuring actions. in the first quarter of 2009, 3m announced the
elimination of approximately 1,200 positions. in addition, 3m announced
reductions of approximately 3,500 positions in 2008, with 2,400 of these
reductions announced in the fourth quarter of 2008. the related net
restructuring charges and other special items reduced net income attributable
to 3m for year 2009 by $119 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. special items
reduced net income attributable to 3m for year 2008 by $194 million, or $0.28
per diluted share, with $140 million, or $0.20 per diluted share, in the fourth
quarter of 2008. refer to the special items discussion at the end of this
overview section for more detail.
fourth-quarter 2009 sales
totaled $6.1 billion, an increase of 11.1 percent from the fourth quarter of
2008, with all business segments and major geographic areas showing
improvement. net income attributable to 3m was $935 million, or $1.30 per
diluted share. this compares to $536 million, or $0.77 per diluted share, which
includes the impact of restructuring and other special items, in the fourth
quarter of 2008.
table of
contents
sales in 2009 totaled
$23.1 billion, a decrease of 8.5 percent from 2008. including the preceding
special items, net income attributable to 3m was $3.193 billion, or $4.52 per
diluted share, in 2009, versus $3.460 billion, or $4.89 per diluted share, in
2008. in 2009, the global economic slowdown dramatically affected year-on-year
comparisons for 3ms businesses. substantial end-market declines and inventory
takedowns in major industries, including automotive, consumer electronics and
general industrial manufacturing, resulted in significantly lower sales and
income. accordingly, 3m reduced its cost structure, lowered manufacturing
output and intensified its attention to operational improvement. the
combination of these actions drove operating income margins of 20.8 percent in
2009, compared to 20.6 percent in 2008. restructuring charges and other special
items reduced this operating income margin by approximately one percentage
point in both 2009 and 2008.
in january2007, 3m
completed the sale of its branded pharmaceuticals business, resulting in a gain
in the first quarter of 2007. in addition, 3m recorded a gain related to the
sale of its opticom priority control systems and canoga traffic detection
businesses in the second quarter of 2007. in 2007, these gains on sale of
businesses were partially offset by restructuring and the net impact of other
special items. refer to special items at the end of this overview section for
additional details. including these special items, in 2007, 3m reported net
sales of $24.462 billion and net income attributable to 3m of $4.096 billion,
or $5.60 per diluted share.

in 2009, while sales
declined 8.5 percent for the total year, this was similar to the overall
economy and close to the estimated decline in worldwide industrial production.
quarterly year-on-year comparisons improved throughout 2009. sales declined
21.3 percent in the first quarter, 15.1 percent in the second quarter and 5.6
percent in the third quarter, but improved 11.1 percent in the fourth quarter.
refer to the sections entitled performance by business segment and performance
by geographic area later in md&a for additional discussion of sales
change.
in 2008, worldwide sales
growth was 3.3 percent. local-currency sales growth was 1.4 percent for 2008,
including a 3.3 percentage point benefit from acquisitions. local-currency
sales increased 17.1 percent in safety, security and protection services
(including 13.0 percentage points from acquisitions), 6.7 percent in health
care (including 1.7 percentage points from acquisitions), 4.1 percent in
industrial and transportation (including 3.7 percentage points from
acquisitions), and 1.0 percent in consumer and office (including 1.8 percentage
points from acquisitions). local-currency sales declined 1.6 percent in electro
and communications and 17.9 percent in display and graphics.
3m generated $4.9 billion
of operating cash flows in 2009, an increase of $408 million when compared to
2008. this followed an increase of $287 million when comparing 2008 to 2007. in
2009, 2008 and 2007, the company utilized approximately $1.4 billion of cash
each year to pay dividends. in february2007, 3ms board of directors
authorized a two-year share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion for the period
from february12, 2007 to february28, 2009. in february2009,
3ms board of directors extended this share repurchase authorization until the
remaining amount is fully utilized. as of december31, 2009, approximately
$2.6 billion remained available for repurchase. with the companys emphasis on
maintaining ample liquidity and enhancing balance sheet strength, share
repurchase activity was suspended beginning in the fourth quarter of 2008. the
extension of this program provides flexibility to resume repurchase activity
when business conditions permit. in 2009 no broker repurchases of stock were
made,
table of contents
compared to repurchases
of 3m common stock of $1.6 billion in 2008 (primarily in the first nine months
of 2008) and repurchases of 3m common stock of $3.2 billion in 2007. in february2010,
3ms board of directors authorized a dividend increase of 2.9 percent for 2010,
marking the 52nd consecutive year of dividend increases for 3m. 3ms debt to
total capital ratio (total capital defined as debt plus equity) at december31,
2009 was 30 percent, compared to 39 percent at december31, 2008. a
portion of the increase in debt at year-end 2008 was the result of a strategy
to build and maintain a cash buffer in the u.s. given the difficult market
environment at that point in time. 3m has an aa- credit rating with a stable
outlook from standard& poors and an aa2 credit rating with a stable
outlook from moodys investors service. in addition to cash on hand, the
company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently anticipated
growth and acquisition investment funding needs.
in 2009, the company experienced cost decreases in
most raw materials and transportation fuel costs. this was driven by lower
basic feedstock costs, particularly metals and oil derived materials. to date
the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw materials to meet its
reasonably foreseeable production requirements. it is impossible to predict
future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such shortages would have.
3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations through careful
management of existing raw material inventories and development and
qualification of additional supply sources. 3m manages commodity price risks
through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward
physical contracts.
in 2009, 3m changed its annual stock option and
restricted stock unit grant date to more closely align the award with the
timing of the companys performance review process. in 2009 and forward, under
the annual grant, 3m will grant shares in februaryinstead of mayas
in previous years. accounting rulesrequires recognition of expense under
a non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense
recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. 3m employees in the united
states are eligible to retire at age 55 and after having completed five years
of service. approximately 25 percent of the stock-based compensation award
expense dollars are for this retiree-eligible population. therefore, in 2007
and 2008, the second quarter of each year (because of the maygrant date)
reflected higher stock-based compensation expense than the other quarters. in
2009, the retiree-eligible impact shifted to the first quarter of 2009. in
addition, both the first and second quarter of 2009 reflected higher
stock-based compensation expense related to the earlier februarygrant
date. these and other factors resulted in higher stock-based compensation cost
in 2009 when compared to 2008. refer to note 16 for additional discussion of
the companys stock-based compensation programs.
3ms pension plans were 90 percent funded at year-end
2009. the u.s. qualified plan, which is approximately 68 percent of the
worldwide pension obligation, was 96 percent funded, and the international
plans were 83 percent funded. asset returns in 2009 for the u.s. qualified plan
were 12.6 percent while the year-end 2009 discount rate was 5.77%, down 0.37
percentage points from the 2008 discount rate of 6.14%. 3m expects to
contribute $500 million to $700 million of cash to its global pension plans in
2010. the company does not have a required minimum pension contribution
obligation for its u.s. plans in 2010. 3m expects pension and postretirement
benefit expense in 2010 to increase by approximately $130 million pre-tax, or
12 cents per diluted share, when compared to 2009. refer to critical accounting
estimates within md&a and note 11 (pension and postretirement benefit
plans) for additional information concerning 3ms pension and post-retirement
plans.
the preceding
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause
results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the forward-looking
statements section in item 7 and the risk factors provided in item 1a for
discussion of these risks and uncertainties).
special items:
special items represent
significant charges or credits that are important to understanding changes in
the companys underlying operations.
in 2009, net losses for
restructuring and other actions decreased operating income by $194 million and
net income attributable to 3m by $119 million, or $0.17 per diluted share. 2009
included restructuring actions ($209 million pre-tax, $128 million after tax
and noncontrolling interest), which were partially offset by a gain on sale of
real estate ($15 million pre-tax, $9 million after tax). the gain on sale of
real estate relates to the june2009 sale of a new jersey roofing granule
facility, which is recorded in cost of sales within the safety, security and
protection services business segment. restructuring is discussed in more detail
in note 4 (restructuring actions and exit activities).
in 2008, net losses for
restructuring and other actions decreased operating income by $269 million and
net income attributable to 3m by $194 million, or $0.28 per diluted share. 2008
included restructuring actions ($229 million pre-tax, $147 million after-tax
and noncontrolling interest), exit activities ($58 million pre-tax, $43 million
after-tax) and losses related to the sale of businesses ($23 million pre-tax,
$32 million after-tax), which were partially offset by a gain on sale of real
estate ($41 million pre-tax, $28 million after-tax). divestiture impacts,
restructuring actions and
table of

exit activities are
discussed in more detail in note 2 (acquisitions and divestitures) and note 4
(restructuring actions and exit activities). concerning the real estate gain,
3m received proceeds and recorded a gain in 2008 for a sale-leaseback
transaction relative to an administrative location in italy.
in 2007, gains on sale of
businesses and real estate, net of restructuring and other items, increased
operating income by $681 million and net income attributable to 3m by $448
million, or $0.62 per diluted share. 2007 included net benefits from gains
related to the sale of businesses ($849 million pre-tax, $550 million
after-tax) and a gain on sale of real estate ($52 million pre-tax, $37 million
after-tax), which were partially offset by increases in other environmental
liabilities ($134 million pre-tax, $83 million after-tax), restructuring
actions ($41 million pre-tax, $27 million after-tax), and other exit activities
($45 million pre-tax, $29 million after-tax). these items, except the gain on
sale of real estate, are discussed in more detail in note 2 (acquisitions and
divestitures), note 4 (restructuring actions and exit activities) and note 14
(commitments and contingencies). gains on sale of businesses include the
second-quarter 2007 sale of 3ms opticom priority control systems and canoga
traffic detection businesses, and the first-quarter 2007 sale of the global
branded pharmaceuticals business in europe. concerning the real estate sale, 3m
sold a laboratory facility located in suwon, korea.

as discussed in the
preceding overview section, 2009 included restructuring charges, partially
offset by a gain on sale of real estate, which combined decreased operating
income by $194 million, or 0.9 percent of net sales. in 2008, the combination
of restructuring actions, exit activities and a loss on sale of businesses,
partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate, decreased operating income
by $269 million, or 1.1 percent of net sales. in 2007, the gain on sale of
businesses and real estate, net of environmental liability charges,
restructuring and exit activities, benefited 2007 operating income by $681
million, or 2.8 percent of net sales. the following tables summarize these

cost of sales:
cost of sales includes
manufacturing, engineering and freight costs. cost of sales as a percent of net
sales decreased 0.5 percentage points in 2009 compared to 2008. as discussed in
note 4 (restructuring actions and exit activities), in 2009, 3m recorded $209
million in restructuring charges, of which $110 million was recorded in cost of
sales. this was partially offset by a $15 million gain on sale of a new jersey
roofing granule facility, which was also recorded in cost of sales. in 2008,
$122 million in restructuring and exit activities were recorded in cost of
sales. thus, restructuring and other items were $27 million lower year-on-year,
benefiting cost of sales by 0.1 percentage point. other benefits to cost of
sales as a percent of net sales included increases in selling prices and a
slight
table of
contents
decrease in material
costs. the company was also able to mitigate organic volume declines through
reductions in 3ms manufacturing cost structure. finally, in response to
deteriorating conditions in venezuela, 3m venezuela swapped bolivars into u.s.
dollars in 2009. while increasing cost of sales, these actions mitigated 3ms
exposure to future exchange rate risks.
cost of sales as a
percent of net sales increased 0.8 percentage points in 2008 compared to 2007,
with this increase primarily due to the decline in optical systems sales and
the rapid volume declines of certain other businesses in the fourth quarter.
for the majority of the year 3ms broad-based portfolio performed as expected,
with benefits from selling price increases, foreign currency translation, and a
continuous focus on driving operational excellence, helping to offset raw
material inflation of approximately 4 percent for 2008, compared with 2007. in
2008, restructuring and exit costs increased cost of sales by $122 million, or
0.4 percentage points as a percent of net sales, similar to the 0.3 percentage
point impact in 2007.
selling,
general and administrative expenses:
selling, general and
administrative (sg&a) expenses as a percent of net sales increased 0.4
percentage points in 2009 when compared to 2008, but in dollars decreased $338
million, helped by restructuring and other actions. in the sales and marketing
area, advertising and merchandising costs were down year-on-year, but were up
in the fourth quarter. as indicated in note 4, in 2009, $91 million in
restructuring expenses was recorded in sg&a, which increased sg&a as a
percent of sales by 0.4 percentage points. in 2008, restructuring actions and
exit activities, net of a gain on sale of real estate, increased sg&a by
$111 million, which increased sg&a as a percent of sales by 0.5 percentage
points.
selling, general and
administrative (sg&a) expenses as a percent of net sales increased 0.3
percentage points in 2008 when compared to 2007, or 4.6 percent in dollars. in
2008, sg&a expenses related to restructuring actions and exit activities
were partially offset by a gain on sale of real estate, which combined
increased sg&a by $111 million, or 0.5 percentage points, similar to the
0.4 percentage point impact in 2007. in the fourth quarter of 2008, as part of
its restructuring program, 3m took aggressive actions to reduce general and
administrative expenses and also pared back selling and marketing costs in
certain businesses.
research, development and related expenses:
research, development and
related expenses (r&d) were 5.6 percent of net sales in 2009, 2008 and
2007. r&d expenses in dollars declined approximately 8 percent in 2009
compared to 2008, following an increase of 2.6 percent when comparing 2008 to
2007. 3m has continued to support its key larger programs, but overall dollar
spending has been impacted by company-wide cost-cutting initiatives such as
reductions in indirect spending and the banked vacation policy change.
gain/loss from sale of businesses:
in
june2008, 3m completed the sale of highjump software to battery ventures,
a technology venture capital and private equity firm. 3m received proceeds of
$85 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets sold,
transaction and other costs, a pre-tax loss of $23 million (recorded in the
safety, security and protection services segment) in the second quarter of
2008.
in january2007, 3m
completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in europe to
meda ab. 3m received proceeds of $817 million for this transaction and
recognized, net of assets sold, a pre-tax gain of $781 million in 2007
(recorded in the health care segment). in june2007, 3m completed the sale
of its opticom priority control systems and canoga traffic detection businesses
to torquest partners inc., a toronto-based investment firm. 3m received
proceeds of $80 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets
sold, transaction and other costs, a pre-tax gain of $68 million (recorded in
the display and graphics segment) in 2007.
operating income:
3m uses operating income
as one of its primary business segment performance measurement tools. operating
income was 20.8 percent of sales in 2009 compared to 20.6 percent of sales in
2008. 2009 was negatively impacted by restructuring expenses, net of a gain on
sale of real estate, which combined decreased operating income by 0.9
percentage points ($194 million). 2008 was negatively impacted by restructuring
actions, exit activities and a loss on sale of businesses that were partially
offset by a gain on sale of real estate, which combined decreased operating
income by 1.1 percentage points ($269 million). operating income margins of
25.3 percent in 2007 were positively impacted by 2.8 percentage points ($681
million) from the gain on sale of businesses and real estate, net of
environmental liabilities, restructuring and other exit activities.

related to higher average u.s. and international long-term debt balances, which
were partially offset by lower short-term debt balances and interest rates.
interest income: interest income declined in
2009 when compared to 2008, primarily due to lower yields on investments. interest income

2008 and $150 million in 2007. this estimate includes the effect of translating
profits from local currencies into u.s. dollars; the impact of currency
fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united
states and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative
instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the
negative impact of swapping venezuelan bolivars into u.s. dollars. 3m estimates
that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses had an
immaterial impact in 2009, and increased net income attributable to 3m by
approximately $40 million in 2008 and by approximately $10 million in 2007.

the
industrial and transportation segment serves a broad range of markets, such as
appliance, paper and packaging, food and beverage, electronics, automotive
original equipment manufacturer (oem) and automotive aftermarket (auto body
shops and retail). industrial and transportation products include tapes, a wide
variety of coated and non-woven abrasives, adhesives, specialty materials,
filtration products, energy control products, closure systems for personal
hygiene products, and components and products that are used in the manufacture,
repair and maintenance of automotive, marine, aircraft and specialty vehicles.
fourth quarter and year 2009
results:
industrial
and transportation is a large and highly diversified set of businesses that,
when taken together, correlate well with the overall economy. early in 2009,
the business saw significant sales declines that required swift and aggressive
restructuring and cost reduction plans to offset the impact of lower volumes,
including the impact of large inventory declines in the wholesale distribution
channel. inventories began to stabilize around mid-year 2009, and it now
appears that inventory and point-of-sale levels in this channel are in
reasonably good balance.
sales
in industrial and transportation rose 10 percent to $1.9 billion in the fourth
quarter. fourth quarter local-currency growth was 4.6 percent, which included
organic volume growth of 3 percent. fourth-quarter growth was led by the
renewable energy business and the automotive oem business. 3m also drove
positive local-currency sales growth in industrial adhesives and tapes,
automotive aftermarket and in dyneon llc, which supplies flouropolymers and
elastomers into the oil, gas and transportation industries. other businesses in
this segment posted local-currency sales declines ranging from one to five
percent in the fourth quarter. on a regional basis, growth was strongest in
latin america and in asia pacific.
the
combination of positive sales volumes in the quarter, higher year-on-year
factory production levels and improvements in cost structure resulted in
operating income growth in the fourth quarter. this segment recorded net charges of $36 million
related to restructuring actions and exit activities in the fourth quarter of
2008. including these net charges, operating income in the
fourth quarter of 2009 increased 86 percent to $397 million and operating
income margins improved by 8.5 percentage points to 20.8 percent.
full-year
2009 sales were $7.1 billion, down 12.9 percent in dollars and down 10.2
percent in local currency. foreign currency impacts penalized sales for the
year by 2.7 percent. sales
increased in the renewable energy and automotive aftermarket businesses, but
sales decreased in the other businesses, impacted by end-market declines. this
segment announced restructuring actions in 2009, along with plant shut-downs,
furloughs and mandatory vacation across the operation. in 2009, this business
segment recorded charges of $88 million related to restructuring actions, with
this charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and
benefits of $83 million and fixed asset impairments of $5 million. including
these special items, 2009 operating income was $1.2 billion and operating
income margins were 17.4 percent. this segment recorded $66 million related to
restructuring and exit activities in 2008.
industrial
and transportation continued to invest aggressively to accelerate its growth
capability. for example, the renewable energy business recently opened a new
large-scale high-tech manufacturing site in singapore, and the industrial
abrasives business opened a new state-of-the-art manufacturing site in north
america. recently, 3m purification inc. launched a high-quality disposable
filtration system for the biopharmaceuticals industry. and finally,
table of
contents
the
automotive aftermarket business introduced the 3m dirt trap protection system, which increases
paint booth productivity and reduces daily maintenance costs in auto body
repair shops.
fourth quarter and year 2008
results:
2008 can be characterized
as a tale of two distinct chapters for industrial and transportation. the first
was januarythrough october, characterized by outstanding top-and
bottom-line growth across most of the portfolio; the second chapter was the
combined months of novemberand december, when many large customers slowed
their operations.
among
3ms business segments, industrial and transportation has been among those most
affected by recent economic contractions, particularly in big industries such
as automotive and electronics. with worldwide industrial production in decline,
3ms industrial and transportation business had fourth quarter 2008 sales of
$1.7 billion, an 11.2 percent decline compared to 2007. local-currency sales
were down 6.4 percent, including a positive 3.1 percent impact from
acquisitions. not all divisions within industrial were impacted equally in the
fourth quarter. those that are heavily linked to automotive manufacturing,
namely automotive oem and dyneon llc, saw declines of more than 20 percent, as
did businesses selling to the electronics industry, such as high-tech tapes and
adhesives. most other divisions experienced local-currency sales contractions
of less than 10 percent in the fourth quarter, with the exception of the
automotive aftermarket business, which posted positive local-currency sales
growth. geographically, fourth quarter 2008 local-currency sales were down in
all regions, with the largest declines in the u.s. and asia pacific, followed
by europe. local-currency sales were flat in latin america. operating income in
the fourth quarter declined 42 percent to $214 million, which included net
charges of $36 million for restructuring actions and exit activities.
full-year 2008 sales were
up 7 percent to $8.2 billion. local-currency growth rates were strongest in the
automotive aftermarket business. 3m also drove strong sales growth in two of
its largest divisions, namely abrasives and industrial tapes and adhesives.
closure systems for personal hygiene products also showed good growth.
geographically, all major regions drove positive local-currency sales growth.
strong market penetration continued in emerging economies, especially the high
growth countries of brazil, russia, india, china and poland, where the business
drove strong organic local-currency growth. operating income declined, but
increased after adjusting for $66 million in restructuring actions and exit
activities (discussed further below). strong operational discipline was the key
to protecting the bottom line as full-year operating margins totaled 18.9
percent, with operating income margins at 19.7 percent after adjusting for
restructuring and exit activities.
industrial
and transportation restructuring and exit activities totaled $66 million for
total year 2008. during the fourth quarter of 2008, restructuring actions
totaling $40 million (partially offset by a $4 million reduction in previously
accrued exit activity charges) were comprised of severance and related benefits
totaling $33 million and asset impairments of $7 million. net exit activity
charges of $26 million in 2008 largely related to employee reductions at an
industrial and transportation manufacturing facility located in the united
kingdom, which totaled $19 million. this compared to restructuring actions and
exit activities of $9 million in 2007.
industrial
and transportation continued to invest in innovative new products along with
complementary gap-fill acquisitions, evidenced by the closing of eight
acquisitions in 2008, with some of the larger acquisitions summarized as
follows. in july2008, 3m acquired k&h surface technologies pty. ltd.,
an australian-based manufacturing company specializing in a range of repair
products for the professional do-it-yourself automotive refinish markets. in august2008,
3m acquired polyfoam products inc., a structural adhesives company specializing
in foam adhesives for tile roofing and other adhesive products for the building
industry. in october2008, 3m completed its acquisition of emfi s.a. and
sapo s.a.s., manufacturers of polyurethane-based structural adhesives and
sealants headquartered in haguenau, france. in october2008, 3m also
completed its acquisition of meguiars inc., a 100-year-old business that
manufactures the leading meguiars brand of car care products for cleaning and
protecting automotive surfaces, which is headquartered in irvine, california.
investment:
in
march2005, 3ms automotive business completed the purchase of 19 percent
of ti&m beteiligungsgesellschaft mbh (ti&m) for approximately $55
million. ti&m is the parent company of i&t innovation technology
entwicklungsund holding aktiengesellschaft (i&t), an austrian maker of flat
flexible cable and circuitry. pursuant to a shareholders agreement, 3m marketed
the firms flat flexible wiring systems for automotive interior applications to
the global automotive market. i&t filed a petition for bankruptcy
protection in august2006. as part of its agreement to purchase the shares
of ti&m, the company was granted a put option, which gave the company the
right to sell back its entire ownership interest in ti&m to the other investors
from whom 3m acquired its 19 percent interest. the put option became
exercisable january1, 2007. the company exercised the put option and
recovered approximately $25 million of its investment from one of the investors
based in belgium in february2007. the other two ti&m investors have
filed a bankruptcy petition in austria. the company is pursuing recovery of the
balance of

its
investment both through the austrian bankruptcy proceedings and pursuant to the
terms of the share purchase agreement. the company received approximately $6
million of its investment back in the fourth quarter of 2008. the company
believes collection of its remaining investment is probable and, as a result,
no impairment reserve has been recorded.

health care segment serves markets that include medical clinics and hospitals,
pharmaceuticals, dental and orthodontic practitioners, and health information
systems. products and services provided to these and other markets include
medical and surgical supplies, skin health and infection prevention products,
drug delivery systems, dental and orthodontic products, health information
systems and anti-microbial solutions. as discussed in note 2, 3m completed the
sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in europe in january2007.
fourth quarter and year 2009
results:
fourth-quarter
sales in health care were $1.1 billion, up nearly 11 percent in dollars and up
6 percent in local currency. foreign exchange impacts added nearly 5 percent to
fourth quarter sales. sales increased in every business within health care,
most notably infection prevention, skin and wound care and health information
systems. the orthodontics business also showed a nice rebound in the fourth
quarter. geographically, sales grew in all major areas led by canada, latin
america and asia pacific.
fourth-quarter
2009 operating income increased to $375 million, or 32.7 percent of sales, with
operating income growth driven by favorable product mix, good cost control and
continued productivity efforts across the portfolio. fourth quarter 2008
includes charges of
$50 million for restructuring and exit activities.
for
the full year, sales were $4.3 billion, up 3.6 percent in local currencies.
this growth was broad-based, with positive contributions from nearly all
businesses. sales growth was led by the infection prevention and skin and wound
care businesses, which provide a multitude of products that improve patient
treatment outcomes and increase efficiency for health care providers. 3m also
drove positive local-currency sales growth in the oral care business. on a
geographic basis, sales growth rates were highest in asia pacific, latin
america and canada.
health care recorded
charges of $20 million related to restructuring actions in 2009, with this
charge comprised of employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. in
2008, this business segment recorded charges of $60 million related to
restructuring and exit activities. including these charges,
full-year operating income in health care grew 15 percent to $1.35 billion,
with operating income margins of 31.4 percent in 2009. 3ms longer-term plan is
to keep reinvesting in this business to drive higher growth, even if operating
income margins at some point compress to the high-20s.
in
addition, the health care business invested in a number of areas to drive new
products, accelerate growth and improve competitiveness. for example, 3ms drug
delivery systems business entered the large and growing dry-powder inhaler
segment. in wound care, 3m strengthened its market leadership in clear wound
dressings with new 3m
tegaderm dressings for
iv sites and chronic wound care. the dental business launched a number of new
products, including new decay-preventative sealants, curing lights and
impression material systems. in health information systems, 3m continued to
launch solutions for the new international classification of diseases (icd-10)
coding, inpatient/outpatient medical record coding, reimbursement and data
connectivity. and finally, 3m opened or expanded major new r&d and
manufacturing facilities around the world, including china, singapore, india,
brazil and dubai. these investments are critical to 3ms growth acceleration
plans around the globe.

fourth quarter and year 2008
results:
in the fourth quarter of 2008, health care sales topped $1
billion, despite a nearly 7 percentage point penalty from currency translation.
in local-currency terms, sales rose 4.3 percent, including 2.2 percent from
acquisitions. 3m saw solid local-currency growth in the medical products area,
specifically in core infection prevention and skin and wound care products.
geographically, the u.s. and asia pacific led sales growth. operating income
margins of 24.0 percent in the fourth quarter of 2008 were the highest in the
company, which includes the impact of $50 million in restructuring and exit
activity charges that reduced operating income margins by 4.9 percentage
points.
for full-year 2008, health cares results were strong, with
sales increasing 8.1 percent to $4.3 billion and operating income margins of
27.3 percent. 2008 includes the impact of $60 million in restructuring and exit
activities that reduced operating income margins by 1.4 percentage points. as
discussed further below, 2007 operating income results include significant
gains from the sale of 3ms pharmaceuticals business in january2007,
negatively impacting the 2008 versus 2007 year-on-year operating income
comparison. local-currency sales were up 6.7 percent, largely organic, but also
included 1.7 percent from acquisitions. in 2008, 3m completed a number of
important bolt-on acquisitions in health care, including top-service, a german
orthodontic technology and services company offering a digital lingual
solution; imtec, an oklahoma-based manufacturer of dental implants and cone
beam computed tomography; and solumed, a quebec-based developer and marketer of
leading-edge medical products designed to prevent infections in operating rooms
and hospitals. full-year 2008 sales were led by strong increases in 3ms
medical, dental and orthodontics businesses. sales grew in all geographies, led
by strong gains in asia pacific and latin america.
the
combination of the following items positively impacted total year 2007 health
care operating income by $791 million. as discussed in note 2, in january2007 the
company sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the europe region. the
operating income gain related to this sale, which is included in health care,
totaled $781 million. in addition, as discussed in note 4, a net operating
income gain of $10 million was recorded in 2007, which primarily related to
adjustments to restructuring costs incurred in the fourth quarter of 2006.

the consumer and office
segment serves markets that include consumer retail, office retail, home improvement,
building maintenance and other markets. products in this segment include office
supply products, stationery products, construction and home improvement
products (do-it-yourself), home care products, protective material products,
certain consumer retail personal safety products, and consumer health care
products.
fourth quarter and year 2009
results:
fourth-quarter 2009 sales
were $887 million, up 11.4 percent in dollar terms and up 7.1 percent in local
currencies. a number of businesses posted positive local-currency sales growth,
including home care products, retail health care, and do-it-yourself and mass
retail. local-currency sales declined just slightly in the office products
business as unemployment levels remain high and employers continue to act
cautiously with respect to office supply purchases. fourth-quarter operating
income in consumer and office increased to $159 million, and operating income
margins were 17.9 percent. fourth-quarter 2008 includes $18 million in
restructuring charges.
consumer and office has
executed a bolt-on acquisition strategy over the past couple of years.
acquisitions contributed 3.7 percent to fourth quarter local-currency sales
growth, largely related to two purchases. in december2008, 3m purchased
futuro, a leading supplier of braces, supports and compression hosiery. in july2009,
3m purchased ace products, one of the strong consumer health care brands, from
becton, dickinson. these investments, combined with 3ms own successful brands,
provide critical mass in the retail drug store channel.
consumer and office has a
long and successful history of growth in the united states via strong,
category-defining brands and an emphasis on customer relationships. 3m is
leveraging this success outside the united states as well. fourth-quarter sales
rose more than 20 percent in latin america, 14 percent in asia pacific and 8
percent in europe. operating income rose in all geographic regions as well.
for the full year 2009,
sales declined 3 percent to $3.5 billion, which was largely due to currency.
operating income margins were at 21.5 percent for the year, up over 2
percentage points versus 2008. in 2009, this business segment recorded charges
of $13 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of
employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. 2008 includes $18
million in restructuring charges.
fourth quarter and year 2008
results:
in the fourth quarter of
2008, consumer and office sales declined 9.6 percent to $796 million. local
currency sales were down 5 percent and currency impacts reduced sales by just
under 5 percentage points. u.s. sales declined by 10 percent, heavily impacted
by the slump in u.s. consumer retail spending levels. more than 50 percent of
sales in consumer and office are generated within the united states. by far the
biggest contributor to this decline was the
table of
contents
retail and wholesale
office channel. the combination of massive office worker layoffs, coupled with
across-the-board declines in office retail foot traffic, had a dramatic and
negative impact on sales. 3m businesses serving other u.s. retail channels
performed well in the fourth quarter despite the tough economic environment.
this business posted positive local-currency sales for its home care products,
such as scotch-brite scrub sponges, and for its do-it-yourself retail channel.
elsewhere around the globe, 3ms consumer and office business drove positive
local-currency sales growth in both latin america and asia pacific, but overall
growth was muted by declines in europe. worldwide operating income declined in
the fourth quarter, including the impact of $18 million in restructuring
charges, which contributed 11.1 percentage points of this 35.7 percent decline.
for total year 2008,
consumer and office sales grew 2.4 percent. this business has successfully
created new products and designed new programs and planograms with their large
u.s. customers in order to mitigate what is a very tough end-market situation.
sales growth was led by home care and do-it-yourself products. acquisitions,
primarily the do-it-yourself retail market portion of 3ms aearo business,
contributed 1.8 percentage points to sales growth. operating income declined
3.8 percent and margins were in excess of 19 percent, a strong return
considering the slow u.s. market environment and a synchronized slowdown in
growth across most other areas of the world. geographically, sales growth was
led by asia pacific and latin america. operating income was negatively impacted
by the $18 million in restructuring charges discussed in the preceding
paragraph.

the
safety, security and protection services segment serves a broad range of
markets that increase the safety, security and productivity of workers,
facilities and systems. major product offerings include personal protection
products, safety and security products (including border and civil security
solutions), cleaning and protection products for commercial establishments,
track and trace solutions, and roofing granules for asphalt shingles. in the
second quarter of 2008, 3m completed the sale of its highjump software business
which provided supply chain execution software solutions. 3ms track and trace
solutions utilize radio frequency identification (rfid) technology to provide a
growing array of solutions  from library patron self-checkout systems to tracking
packages.
fourth quarter and year 2009
results:
in safety, security and
protection services, sales grew 13.5 percent in the fourth quarter, or 7.9
percent in local currency. foreign exchange impacts added 5.6 percent to fourth
quarter sales. sales growth in the quarter was largely driven by the personal
protection business. in mayof 2009, 3m began to see a surge in orders for
respirators approved for use in defending against the h1n1 virus. since that
time, demand has continued to exceed available supply. 3m recently approved
respirator capacity investments in both singapore and in the united states.
elsewhere within this
segment, local-currency sales growth was slightly positive in the building and
commercial services business, driven by a number of new product introductions,
but all other businesses posted lower year-on-year sales. in particular, 3m saw
more than 10 percent local-currency sales declines in its industrial-oriented
corrosion protection products business, and in businesses linked closely to
residential construction, such as roofing granules.
fourth-quarter operating
income increased to $201 million, with operating income margins at 24.3
percent. fourth quarter 2008 included $12 million in restructuring expenses.
full-year 2009 sales in
safety, security and protection services totaled $3.2 billion, down 7.8 percent
in dollar-terms and 2.7 percent in local currencies. 3m drove positive
local-currency growth in personal protection products, but all other businesses
posted declines for the full year. the global economic downturn negatively
impacted the industrial and construction-related businesses within this
segment.
table of
contents
despite the near 8
percent sales decline for the year, operating income margins rose to 23.4
percent. in 2009, this business segment recorded charges of $17 million related
to restructuring actions, comprised of employee-related liabilities for
severance and benefits. this charge was partially offset by a gain of $15
million related to the sale of 3ms new jersey roofing granule facility. in the
second quarter of 2008, 3m completed the sale of its highjump software business
and recognized a pre-tax loss of $23 million. in addition, 3m recorded
restructuring charges and exit activities that totaled $15 million in 2008.
in june2009,
3ms security systems division was notified that the uk government decided to
award its passport production to a competitor upon the expiration of 3ms

future of this business, and the growth prospects remain strong. 3m continues
to aggressively work to win additional contracts in other countries. refer to critical
accounting estimates within managements discussion and analysis of financial
condition and results of operations for additional discussion.
fourth quarter and year 2008
results:
in
the fourth quarter of 2008, sales in this business rose 1.0 percent to $729
million. local-currency sales increased 11.5 percent, driven by 3ms 2008
acquisition of aearo technologies. acquisitions contributed 14.4 percentage
points of growth in the fourth quarter. on a geographic basis, sales for the
quarter were strongest in the united states, followed by the asia pacific
region. operating income in the fourth quarter declined 10.5 percent, which
included $12 million in restructuring expenses.
full-year
2008 sales increased 17.2 percent. in local-currency terms, sales rose
approximately 17 percent, comprised of 13 points from acquisitions and 2 points
each from organic volumes and selling price increases. sales growth was led by
acquisitions, primarily aearo, along with organic growth in personal protection
solutions, cleaning and protection solutions for commercial buildings, and rfid
solutions (track and trace). aearo, acquired in april2008,
manufactures and sells personal protection and energy absorbing products. aearo
expanded 3ms platform by adding hearing protection as well as eyewear and fall
protection product lines to 3ms existing line of respiratory products. in july2008,
3m acquired quest technologies inc., a manufacturer of environmental monitoring
equipment, including noise, heat stress and vibration monitors. the sale of
highjump software (discussed below) resulted in a 1.8 percentage point
penalty to full-year sales. worldwide operating income was up 21.7 percent to
$710 million.
in
2008, 3m announced and completed the sale of its highjump software business and
recognized a pre-tax loss of $23 million in the second quarter of 2008. in
addition, 3m recorded restructuring charges and exit activities that totaled
$15 million in 2008. including the preceding 2008 items, operating income
margins were in excess of 20 percent for 2008. in the second quarter of 2007,

the display and graphics
segment serves markets that include electronic display, traffic safety and
commercial graphics. this segment includes optical film solutions for
electronic displays; computer screen filters; reflective sheeting for
transportation safety; commercial graphics systems; and projection systems,
including mobile display technology and visual systems products. the optical
film business provides films that serve numerous market segments of the
electronic display industry. 3m provides distinct products for five market
segments, including products for: 1) lcd computer monitors 2) lcd televisions
3) handheld devices such as cellular phones 4) notebook pcs and 5) automotive
displays. the optical
business includes a number of different products that are protected by
table of contents
various patents and
groups of patents. these patents provide varying levels of exclusivity to 3m
for a number of such products. as some of 3ms optical film patents begin to
expire in the next few years, 3m will likely see more competition in these
products. 3m continues to innovate in
the area of optical films and files patents on its new technology and products.
3ms proprietary manufacturing technology and know-how also provide a
competitive advantage to 3m independent of its patents.
fourth quarter and year 2009
results:
display and graphics
fourth quarter sales increased nearly 19 percent to $817 million. sales grew
15.7 percent in local currencies, and foreign exchange impacts added just over
3 percentage points to the fourth quarter growth rate. operating income
increased to $141 million. operating income in the fourth quarter of 2008
included net charges of $22 million for restructuring actions and exit
activities.
optical systems continued
to grow in the fourth quarter, with sales up over 50 percent year-on-year.
innovation was the key driver, as 3m film technology effectively improves the
energy efficiency of an lcd panel by over 30 percent and can greatly simplify
its design. sales of optical films began to accelerate in the second and third
quarter of 2009, and even though fourth-quarter sales declined sequentially due
to normal seasonal reductions, year-on-year growth rates were strong. optical
will remain intensely competitive going forward. 3ms oem customers continue to
drive price reductions, and 3m will need to continue to respond with aggressive
cost reduction and productivity in order to fund new products.
fourth-quarter
local-currency sales were up slightly in traffic safety systems, driven by the december2008
acquisition of a finished license plate provider in france. sales in the
commercial graphics business were flat sequentially versus third-quarter and
declined year-on-year as advertising spending remains soft.
for the full year, sales
in display and graphics declined 4 percent to $3.1 billion, and operating
income increased 1.3 percent to $590 million. sales grew in traffic safety
systems and optical systems, but declined in commercial graphics as the global
recession significantly slowed spending on corporate advertising. in 2009,
operating income margins were 18.8 percent, negatively impacted by 0.8
percentage points due to net restructuring charges of $22 million. this net
aggregate charge included fixed asset impairments of $13 million and
employee-related severance/benefits/other of $9 million, which is recorded net
of adjustments to previously recorded restructuring charges. in 2008,
restructuring charges and exit activities reduced operating income by $42
million.
display and graphics is
working aggressively to accelerate longer-term growth possibilities for the
business. for example, this segment formed a new architectural markets business
to further 3ms footprint in film solutions for interior surfaces and for
energy efficient lighting solutions. display and graphics also formed a new
mobile interactive solutions business to develop products that improve
projection, personalization and privacy for mobile device users. in addition,
this segment announced a unique optical film that enables 3d viewing on
handheld devices without the need for 3d glasses. finally, display and graphics
is preparing to launch the third in a family of pocket projectors, the 3m mpro
150, which projects high-quality images up to 50 inches.
fourth quarter and year 2008
results:
results in this business
were affected by end-market challenges in 3ms optical films business. demand
for optical films slowed considerably in novemberand decemberof
2008 as tv, desktop monitor and notebook pc makers cancelled orders for
large-size lcd panels due to weak holiday season sales, reflecting the global
downturn in both consumer and corporate demand. for the fourth quarter, 3m
posted sales of $687 million in display and graphics. sales declined 28
percent, or about 8 percent excluding optical. traffic safety systems posted
local-currency sales growth of nearly 3 percent, as highway infrastructure projects
around the world grew at a modest rate. local-currency sales declined by 6.2
percent in 3ms commercial graphics business and by 48 percent in optical
systems. operating income in the fourth quarter declined 80 percent, which
included net charges of $22 million for restructuring and exit activities.
for the full year of
2008, sales declined 16.6 percent, driving operating income down 50 percent to
$583 million. operating margins were at 17.8 percent for 2008. 3m took
aggressive action during 2008 to reduce its cost structure across all
businesses within display and graphics with particular focus on the optical
film business. second-half 2008 restructuring charges and exit activities of
$42 million reduced operating income for total year 2008. these expenses were
comprised of severance/related benefits and asset impairments. in 2007, 3m
recorded a gain on the sale of its opticom priority control systems and canoga
traffic detection businesses, which was partially offset by expenses related to
restructuring and exit activities. these items on a combined basis benefited
operating income by $51 million in 2007. in aggregate, these items contributed
approximately 6 percentage points of this 50 percent operating income decline
when comparing 2008 to 2007. in addition, the 2008 restructuring and exit
activity charges reduced 2008 operating income margins by 1.3 percentage
points, while the 2007 net benefit contributed 1.3 percentage points of the
29.8 percent operating income margin for 2007.

quarter, with operating income margins approaching 19 percent for the second
consecutive quarter. the fourth quarter of 2008 included $7 million in
restructuring expenses. electro and communications is driving operational
efficiencies in the business to offset what has been an extremely challenging
global business environment.
sales for the full-year 2009
were $2.3 billion, down 19.7 percent, with local-currency sales declining 17.8
percent, foreign currency translation reducing sales by 1.7 percent, and
divestitures reducing sales by 0.2 percent. the global economic downturn
weighed heavily on all businesses, particularly telecom infrastructure,
commercial construction and utilities. operating income for the year was $322
million, with operating income margins of 14.2 percent. operating income in
2009 included charges
of $11 million related to restructuring actions, with this charge comprised of
employee-related liabilities for severance and benefits. operating
income in 2008 was impacted by $7 million in restructuring expenses
in electro and
communications, 3m was encouraged by the fourth quarter sales improvement and
the progress in streamlining the cost structure of the business in 2009. in
addition, this business has recently developed and introduced a number of new
products, including solutions for touch-enabled mobile handheld devices and
smart phones. other recent product launches include electrically conductive
optically clear adhesives, wafer handling systems for semiconductor

fourth quarter and year 2008
results:
this
business serves a number of end-markets, the most important being consumer
electronics and telecommunications, along with the global power utility
industry. in the fourth quarter of 2008, the weak holiday season experienced by
the consumer electronics retailers had a large and negative impact on sales in
this business. likewise the global telecommunications sector continued to cut
capital spending on new capacity and on upgrades of existing equipment. 3m had
a large number of equipment orders cancelled during the fourth quarter of 2008.
as a result of this end-market contraction, sales in electro and communications
declined by 15 percent in the fourth quarter. sales in local currency decreased
about 12 percent, and currency impacts hurt sales by about 3 percentage points.
operating income declined 38 percent, which included $7 million in
restructuring expenses.

markets materials businesses drove growth. the communications markets and
electronics solutions businesses remained soft. 3m also continued to experience
declines in the flexible circuits business where a number of product solutions
were going end-of-life. operating income in 2008 was impacted by $7 million in
restructuring expenses, while 2007 included $18 million in restructuring
expenses, primarily for asset impairment charges related to the companys
decision to close a facility in wisconsin, and $23 million for employee
reductions and fixed asset impairments related to the consolidation of certain
flexible circuit manufacturing operations. in aggregate, these items
contributed 6.7 percentage points of the reported 7.9 percent operating income
growth when comparing 2008 to the 2007.
performance
by geographic area
while
3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results
are the most relevant measure of performance, the company also utilizes
geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. export sales are
generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m
customers are made. a portion of the products or components sold by 3ms
operations to its customers are exported by these customers to different
geographic areas. as customers move their operations from one geographic area
to another, 3ms results will follow. thus, net sales in a particular
geographic area are not indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic
area.
financial
information related to 3m operations in various geographic areas is provided in
note 18. operating income results by geographic area were significantly
impacted by restructuring and other items. in 2009, restructuring actions,
partially offset by a gain on sales of real estate, decreased worldwide
operating income by $194 million, with the largest impact in europe, asia
pacific and the united states. in 2008, restructuring actions, exit
activities and a loss on sale of businesses, which were partially offset by a
gain on sale of real estate, decreased worldwide operating income by $269
million, with the largest impact in the united states and europe.
in 2007, the gain on sale of businesses and a gain on sale of real estate, net
of restructuring and other items, increased worldwide operating income by $681
million, with the largest impact in europe.

for
total year 2009, as shown in the preceding table, all major geographic areas
showed sales declines; however, year-on-year sales growth improved each quarter
throughout the year. in the fourth quarter of 2009, sales growth of 11.1
percent was broad-based. every major geographic region expanded sales, with
strong performances in asia pacific at 22 percent and latin america and canada
each at 19 percent. with respect to organic volume, asia pacific led the way at
nearly 19 percent for the fourth quarter. korea, china and taiwan posted the
most significant increases, driven by a combination of improved local demand
along with the pickup in global electronics. organic volumes were flat to
slightly down in other geographic regions, which is an improvement versus the
levels of decline seen in the first three quarters of 2009. for 2009,
international operations represented approximately 63 percent of 3ms sales.

in
2008, u.s. local-currency sales increased 2.7 percent, with acquisitions
contributing 5.3 percentage points. u.s. organic local-currency sales growth
was led by health care. safety, security and protection services and industrial
and transportation also drove positive sales growth, helped by acquisitions.
this was partially offset by softness in the electronic solutions business and
weakness in a few businesses that are impacted by the slowdown in the u.s.
housing, road construction and mass retail markets and office supply
businesses. asia pacific local-currency sales declined 5.9 percent. the
significant decrease in optical systems within display and graphics more than
offset the sales growth in the other five business segments. sales in japan
totaled approximately $2.2 billion, with local-currency sales down 5.2 percent
from 2007. europe local-currency sales increased 2.8 percent, helped by
acquisitions, with growth in safety, security and protection services, health
care, and industrial and transportation. in the combined latin america and
canada area, local-currency sales increased 12.8 percent, with growth in all
business segments. foreign currency translation positively impacted europe
sales by 4.0 percent, the combined latin america and canada area sales by 2.4
percent, and the asia pacific area by 3.2 percent, as the u.s. dollar

employment:
at
december31, 2009, employment declined by 4,348 positions since year-end
2008, largely driven by restructuring actions taken in the fourth quarter of
2008 through the third quarter of 2009. at december31, 2008, employment
increased by approximately 2,900 positions since year-end 2007, with
acquisitions during 2008 adding approximately 3,700 positions as of december31,
2008. in 2008, 3m added employees in brazil, india, russia, china and poland,
where total sales increased more than 15 percent. these increases were offset
by reductions in employment in 2008 for a portion of the job eliminations that
were announced in connection with restructuring and exit activities.
capital spending/net property, plant and equipment:
the
bulk of 3m capital spending historically has been in the united states,
resulting in higher net property, plant and equipment balances in the united
states. the company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing and
sourcing with geographic market sales, and because approximately 63 percent of
sales are outside the united states, this would increase production outside the
united states, helping to improve customer service and reduce working capital
requirements. the dollar amounts in the preceding table support this trend, as
international capital spending as a percent of worldwide capital spending
increased from 41 percent in 2007 to 49 percent in 2009. capital expenditures
were $903 million in 2009, compared to $1.471 billion in 2008 and $1.422
billion in 2007. in response to global economic conditions, the company reduced
its capital spending significantly in 2009. a substantial amount of the 2009
spending was carryover from 2008 or for tooling needed for new products and
continued operations. the company expects 2010 capital spending to be
approximately $1 billion as 3m continues to fund growth opportunities around
the world.

critical accounting estimates
information
regarding significant accounting policies is included in note 1. as stated in
note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of contingent assets
and liabilities. management bases its estimates on historical experience and on
various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances,
the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other
sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the
company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to legal
proceedings, the companys pension and postretirement obligations, asset
impairments and income taxes. senior management has discussed the development,
selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit
committee of 3ms board of directors.
legal
proceedings:
the
categories of claims for which the company has estimated its probable
liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of its
related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to
legal proceedings. please refer to the section entitled accrued liabilities
and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings (contained in legal
proceedings in note 14) for additional information about such estimates.
pension and postretirement obligations:
3m
has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all u.s.
employees and many employees outside the united states. the company accounts
for its defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life
insurance benefit plans in accordance with accounting standard codification
(asc) 715, compensation  retirement benefits,
in measuring plan assets and benefit obligations and in determining the
amount of net periodic benefit cost. asc 715 requires employers to recognize
the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit pension or
postretirement plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial
position and recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the
changes occur through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a
component of stockholders equity.
pension
benefits associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each
participants years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or
termination. two critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected
return on plan assets, are important elements of expense and liability
measurement. the assumed health care trend rate is the most significant
postretirement health care assumption. see note11 for additional
discussion of actuarial assumptions used in determining pension and
postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
the
company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the
december31 measurement date for the u.s. pension and postretirement
benefit plans. the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the
associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. the
company sets its rate to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality,
fixed-income debt instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in
timing and amount to settle projected future benefits. using this methodology,
the company determined a discount rate of 5.77% for u.s. pension and 5.62% for
u.s. postretirement to be appropriate as of december31, 2009, which is a
decrease from the 6.14% rate used as of december31, 2008. for the
international pension and postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect
the current rate at which the associated liabilities could be effectively
settled at the end of the year. the weighted average discount rate for
international pension plans as of december31, 2009 was 5.30%, a decrease
from the 5.53% rate used as of december31, 2008.
a
significant element in determining the companys pension expense in accordance
with asc 715, is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on
historical results for similar allocations among asset classes. for the u.s.
pension plan, the expected long-term rate of return on an annualized basis for
2010 is 8.50%, the same as 2009. refer to note 11 for information on how the
2010 rate was determined. return on assets assumptions for international
pension and other post-retirement benefit plans are calculated on a
plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and expected long-term rate of
return assumptions. the weighted average expected return for the international
pension plan is 6.89% for 2010, comparable to the weighted average expected
return of 6.86% for 2009.
for the year ended december31,
2009, the company recognized total consolidated pre-tax pension expense (after
settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) of $176 million, up
from $89million in 2008. pension expense (before settlements,
curtailments and special termination benefits) is anticipated to increase to
approximately $300million in 2010. for the pension plans, holding all
other factors constant, an increase/decrease in
table of
contents
the expected long-term
rate of return on plan assets of 0.25 of a percentage point would
decrease/increase 2010 pension expense by approximately $27million for
u.s. pension plans and approximately $10 million for international pension
plans. also, holding all other factors constant, an increase/decrease in the
discount rate used to measure plan liabilities of 0.25 of a percentage point
would decrease/increase 2010 pension expense by approximately $33 million for
u.s. pension plans and approximately $17 million for international pension
plans. see note11 for details of the impact of a one percentage point
change in assumed health care trend rates on the postretirement health care
benefit expense and obligation.
asset impairments:
as
of december31, 2009, net property, plant and equipment totaled $7.0
billion and net identifiable intangible assets totaled $1.3 billion. management
makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial
statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. this
includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business,
including assets of acquired businesses. these estimates and assumptions are
closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances warrant. for instance,
expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment recorded based on a
change in the expected use of the asset or performance of the related asset
group. impairments recorded in 2009, 2008 and 2007 related to restructuring
actions and other exit activities are discussed in note4.
in june2009, 3ms
security systems division (within the safety, security and protection services
business segment) was notified that the uk government decided to award the
production of its passports to a competitor upon the expiration of 3ms
existing uk passport contracts in october2010. 3m remains confident in
the future of its overall passport business, and the growth prospects remain
strong. 3m continues to aggressively work to win additional contracts in other
countries. however, as a result of this event, in june2009, 3m tested the
long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity for recoverability
and also reassessed their remaining useful lives. in addition, 3m tested
goodwill for impairment at the reporting unit (security systems division)
level.
the result of the june2009
test of recoverability of long lived assets associated with the uk passport
activity indicated that the asset groupings carrying amount of approximately
$54 million (before impairment) exceeded the remaining expected cash flows.
accordingly, 3m recorded a non-cash impairment charge of approximately $13
million in the second quarter of 2009 to write these assets down to their fair
value. in addition, accelerated depreciation/amortization is being taken over
the period june2009 through the date of expiration of the contract based
on a reassessment of the remaining expected useful life of these assets.
3m goodwill totaled
approximately $5.8 billion as of december31, 2009, which, based on
impairment testing, is not impaired. impairment testing for goodwill is done at
a reporting unit level, with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit.
reporting units are one level below the business segment level (3m has six
business segments at december31, 2009), but can be combined when
reporting units within the same segment have similar economic characteristics.
at 3m, reporting units generally correspond to a division. as of december31,
2009, 3m did not combine any of its reporting units for impairment testing.
an impairment loss
generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units
net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the
reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry
groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. 3m typically uses the
price/earnings ratio approach for stable and growing businesses that have a
long history and track record of generating positive operating income and cash
flows. 3m uses the discounted cash flow approach for start-up, loss position
and declining businesses, but also uses discounted cash flow as an additional
tool for businesses that may be growing at a slower rate than planned due to
economic or other conditions. 3m completes its annual impairment tests in the
fourth quarter of each year.
as of december31,
2009, 3m had 37 primary reporting units, with eight reporting units accounting
for approximately 75 percent of the goodwill. these eight reporting units were
comprised of the following divisions: 3m purification inc., occupational health
and environmental safety, optical systems, 3m espe, communication markets,
industrial adhesives and tapes, security systems, and health information
systems.
the fair values for the
majority of reporting units were in excess of carrying value by more than 30
percent. the fair values for 3m purification inc., optical systems and security
systems, based on fourth quarter 2009 testing, were in excess of carrying value
by approximately 15 percent to 30 percent, with no impairment indicated. as
part of its annual impairment testing in the fourth quarter, 3m used a
weighted-average discounted cash flow analysis for its 3m purification inc.,
optical systems and security systems divisions, using projected cash flows that
were weighted based on different sales growth and terminal value assumptions,
among other factors. the weighting was based on managements estimates of the
likelihood of each scenario occurring.
table of
contents
in 2009, for those
reporting units whose fair value was in excess of carrying value by more than
30 percent, 3m primarily used an industry price-earnings ratio approach, but
also used a discounted cash flows approach for certain reporting units. in
2008, 3m adjusted the stated applicable industry price-earnings ratio downward
for its annual test in the fourth quarter, unlike prior years when no
adjustment was required. without this adjustment, the addition of each
reporting units estimated market values would have been significantly in
excess of 3ms total company market value, which would have resulted in an
unusually high implied control premium. the control premium is defined as the
sum of the individual reporting units estimated market values compared to 3ms
total company market value, with the sum of the individual values typically
being larger than the value for the total company. for example, at year-end
2008, 3ms market value was approximately $40 billion, but if each reporting
unit was sold individually, 3ms value would be approximately $52 billion using
a 30 percent control premium. 3m factored down its price/earnings ratio
significantly for the respective reporting units to approximate what the
price/earnings ratio would be at a more normal historical control premium of
approximately 30 percent for the total company. even after including this
adjustment to the price-earnings ratio, no goodwill impairment was indicated
for any of the reporting units in 2008. in the fourth quarter of 2009, 3ms
estimated control premium ranged from 15 to 30 percent, with no adjustment
required to the price/earnings ratios. based on its annual test in the fourth
quarter of 2009, no goodwill impairment was indicated for any of the reporting
units. in addition, 3ms market value at december31, 2009 of
approximately $59 billion is significantly in excess of its equity of
approximately $13 billion.
factors which could
result in future impairment charges, among others, include changes in worldwide
economic conditions, changes in competitive conditions and customer
preferences, and fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. these risk
factors are discussed in item 1a, risk factors, of this document. as of december31,
2009, 3m had approximately $1 billion of goodwill related to 3m purification
inc., $800 million related to optical systems, and $200 million of goodwill
associated with the security systems division. if future non-cash impairment
charges are taken, 3m would expect that only a portion of the long-lived assets
or goodwill would be impaired. 3m will continue to monitor its reporting units
in 2010 for any triggering events or other indicators of impairment.
income taxes:
the extent of 3ms
operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application
of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. the final taxes
paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing
authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from
federal, state, and international tax audits. the company recognizes potential
liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the
united states and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and
the extent to which, additional taxes will be due. as of january1, 2007,
the company follows guidance provided by asc 740, income taxes, regarding uncertainty in income taxes, to
record these liabilities (refer to note 8 for additional information). the
company adjusts these reserves in light of changing facts and circumstances;
however, due to the complexity of some of these uncertainties, the ultimate
resolution may result in a payment that is materially different from the
companys current estimate of the tax liabilities. if the companys estimate of
tax liabilities proves to be less than the ultimate assessment, an additional
charge to expense would result. if payment of these amounts ultimately proves
to be less than the recorded amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would
result in tax benefits being recognized in the period when the company
determines the liabilities are no longer necessary.

financial condition and liquidity
the strength of 3ms
capital structure and consistency of its cash flows provide 3m reliable access
to capital markets. as indicated in the following table, at december31,
2009, 3m had $4.6 billion of cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities
and $5.710 billion of debt. debt included $5.097 billion of long-term debt,
$522 million related to the current portion of long-term debt and other
borrowings of $91 million. the current portion of long-term debt includes $350
million in dealer remarketable securities, which ultimately mature in december2010.
while economic conditions remain uncertain, 3m is committed to managing its
capital structure very carefully.
the company generates
significant ongoing cash flow. a portion of the increase in debt at year-end
2008 was the result of a strategy to build and maintain a cash buffer in the
u.s. given the difficult market environment at that point in time. increases in
long-term debt have been used to partially fund share repurchase activities and
acquisitions. on april1, 2008, 3m (safety, security and protection
services business) completed its acquisition of 100 percent of the outstanding
shares of aearo  a global leader in the personal protection industry that
manufactures and markets personal protection and energy absorbing products
for approximately $1.2 billion, inclusive of debt assumed, which was
immediately paid off.

cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities at december31, 2009 totaled
approximately $4.6 billion, helped by cash flows from operating activities of
$4.9 billion. the company has sufficient liquidity to meet currently
anticipated growth plans, including capital expenditures, working capital
investments and acquisitions. the company does not utilize
derivative instruments linked to the companys stock. however, the company does
have contingently convertible debt that, if conditions for conversion are met,
is convertible into shares of 3m common stock (refer to note 10 in this
document).
the
companys financial condition and liquidity are strong. various assets and
liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly
from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. working capital
(defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $5.898 billion at
december31, 2009, compared with $3.759 billion at december31, 2008.
working capital increases were attributable to increases in cash and cash
equivalents, short-term marketable securities and accounts receivable, while
decreases in short-term debt, accrued income taxes and other current
liabilities also increased working capital. this was partially offset by
working capital increases attributable to increases in accounts payable and
accrued payroll, combined with decreases in inventory and other current assets.
primary short-term liquidity
needs are met through u.s. commercial paper and euro commercial paper
issuances. the
company maintains a commercial paper program that allows 3m to have a maximum
of $3 billion outstanding with a maximum maturity of 397 days from date of
issuance. as of december31, 2009, 3m had no outstanding commercial paper,
compared to $575 million in total commercial paper outstanding at december31,
2008. the company believes it is unlikely that its access to the commercial
paper market will be restricted. effective april30, 2007, the company has
a $1.5-billion five-year credit facility, which has provisions for the company
to request an increase of the facility up to $2 billion (at the lenders
discretion), and providing for up to $150 million in letters of credit. at december31,
2009, available short-term committed lines of credit, including the preceding
$1.5 billion five-year credit facility, totaled approximately $1.593 billion,
of which approximately $145 million was utilized for letters of credit and
other short-term borrowings in connection with normal business activities. debt
covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
the
company has a well-known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement,
effective february17, 2009, which registers an indeterminate amount of
debt or equity securities for future sales. no securities have been issued
under this shelf. the company intends to use the proceeds from future
securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes. in connection
with a prior well-known seasoned issuer shelf registration, in june2007
the company established a $3 billion medium-term notes program. three debt
securities have been issued under this medium-term

poors and an aa2 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from moodys investors
service. at december31, 2009, $350 million of dealer remarketable
securities had ratings triggers (bbb-/baa3 or lower) that would require
repayment of debt. in addition, under the $1.5-billion five-year credit
facility agreement, 3m is required to maintain its ebitda to interest ratio as
of the end of each fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. this is calculated
(as defined in the agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total ebitda for the
four consecutive quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded
debt for the same period. at december31, 2009, this ratio was
approximately 27 to 1.
3ms
cash and cash equivalents balance at december31, 2009 totaled $3.040
billion, with an additional $1.569 billion in current and long-term marketable
securities. 3ms strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with
significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going
forward. the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth,
including continual review of acquisition opportunities. 3m paid dividends of
$1.431 billion in 2009, and has a long history of dividend increases. in february2010,
the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3m common stock by
2.9 percent to 52.5 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.10
per share. in february2007, 3ms board of directors authorized a two-year
share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion for the period from february12,
2007 to february28, 2009. in february2009, 3ms board of directors
extended this share repurchase authorization until the remaining amount is
fully utilized. at december31, 2009, the company has $2.6 billion
remaining under this authorization.
in
2010, the company expects to contribute in cash an amount in the range of $500
million to $700 million to its u.s. and international pension plans. the
company does not have a required minimum pension contribution obligation for
its u.s. plans in 2010. therefore, the amount of the anticipated discretionary
contribution could vary significantly depending on the u.s. qualified plans
funded status as of the 2010 measurement date and the anticipated tax
deductibility of the contribution. future contributions will also depend on
market conditions, interest rates and other factors. 3m believes its strong
cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without
compromising growth opportunities.
the
company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on
certain working capital assets and liabilities. these measures are not defined
under u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the
same as similarly titled measures used by other companies. one of the primary
working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index, which includes accounts
receivable, inventory and accounts payable. this combined index (defined as
quarterly net sales  fourth quarter at year-end  multiplied by four, divided
by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts payable) was 5.5
at december31, 2009, a significant improvement from 4.5 at december31,
2008. receivables increased $55 million, or 1.7 percent, compared with december31,
2008. currency translation increased accounts receivable by $82 million
year-on-year, as the u.s. dollar weakened in aggregate against a multitude of
currencies. inventories decreased $374 million, or 12.4 percent, compared with december31,
2008. currency translation increased inventories by $71 million year-on-year.
accounts payable increased $152million compared with december31,
2008. currency translation increased accounts payable by $17 million
year-on-year.

cash flows from operating
activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as pension
funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can significantly
impact cash flows. in the third quarter of 2009, the company contributed $600
million to its u.s. defined benefit pension plan in shares of the companys
common stock, which is considered a non-cash financing activity. this non-cash
activity is not reflected in the operating or financing section of the cash
flows.
in 2009, cash flows
provided by operating activities increased $408 million compared to 2008. the
main positive contribution to operating cash flows related to year-on-year
working capital improvements of $771 million (which includes accounts
receivable, inventories and accounts payable). in addition, lower cash tax
payments in 2009 benefited cash flows. these positive contributions were
partially offset by a decrease of $276 million in net income including
noncontrolling interest. the category, other-net, in the preceding table
reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts. this includes the
impact of cash outlays for restructuring payments, net of restructuring
expenses, which on a combined basis reduced liabilities (note 4). in addition,
decreases in banked vacation accruals reduced liabilities.
in 2008, cash flows
provided by operating activities increased $287 million. net income including
noncontrolling interest decreased $631 million, primarily due to gains from the
sale of businesses in 2007 which did not repeat in 2008. accounts receivable
decreases benefited cash flows in 2008, but increases in inventories and
decreases in accounts payable negatively impacted cash flows. the category other-net
in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts,
including outstanding liabilities at december31, 2008 related to 3ms
restructuring actions (note 4).

investments
in property, plant and equipment enable growth in diverse markets, helping to
meet product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. in response to
global economic conditions, the company reduced its capital spending
significantly in 2009. a substantial amount of the 2009 spending was carryover
from 2008 or for tooling needed for new products and continued operations. the
company expects 2010 capital spending to be approximately $1 billion as 3m
continues to fund growth opportunities around the world.
in 2008, major facility
efforts included completion of production lines in the united states for both
consumer and office and health care, an r&d laboratory in korea, a tape
building in poland, and numerous tape lines and building expansions in china.
in 2008, 3m also made progress towards completion of investments in a singapore
multi-purpose manufacturing facility and film production facilities and made
progress towards completion of manufacturing cost reduction investments in two
of its u.s. film manufacturing plants.
in 2007, numerous plants
were opened or expanded internationally. this included two facilities in korea
(respirator manufacturing facility and optical plant), industrial
adhesives/tapes facilities in both brazil and the philippines, a plant in
russia (corrosion protection, industrial adhesive and tapes, and respirators),
a plant in china (optical systems, industrial adhesives and tapes, and personal
care), an expansion in canada (construction and home improvement business), in
addition to investments in india, mexico and other countries. in addition, 3m
expanded manufacturing capabilities in the u.s., including investments in
industrial adhesives/tapes and optical.
refer
to note 2 for information on acquisitions. note 2 also provides information on
the proceeds from the sale of businesses. the company is actively considering
additional acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to
time may also divest certain businesses.
purchases of marketable securities and investments
and proceeds from sale (or maturities) of marketable securities and investments
are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities,
agency securities, corporate medium-term note securities and other securities, which are classified as available-for-sale.
interest rate risk and credit risk related to the underlying collateral may
impact the value of investments in asset-backed securities, while factors such
as general conditions in the overall credit market and the nature of the
underlying collateral may affect the liquidity of investments in asset-backed
securities. the coupon interest rates for asset-backed securities are either
fixed rate or floating.floating rate coupons reset monthly or quarterly
based upon the corresponding monthly or quarterly libor rate.each
individual floating rate security has a coupon based upon the respective libor
rate +/- an amount reflective of the credit risk of the issuer and the
underlying collateral on the original issue date.terms of the reset are
unique to individual securities.fixed rate coupons are established at the
time the security is issued and are based upon a spread to a related maturity
treasury bond.the spread against the treasury bond is reflective of the
credit risk of the issuer and the underlying collateral on the original issue
date. 3m does not currently expect risk related to its holdings in asset-backed
securities to materially impact its financial condition or liquidity. refer to
note 9 for more details about 3ms diversified marketable securities
portfolio, which totaled $1.569 billion as of december31, 2009. in 2005, 3m purchased 19 percent of
ti&m beteiligungsgesellschaft mbh for approximately $55 million. in 2008
and 2007, the recovery of approximately $6 million and $25 million,
respectively, reduced investments and is shown in cash flows within proceeds
from sale of marketable securities and investments. this investment is
discussed in more detail under the preceding section entitled industrial and
transportation business. additional purchases of investments include additional
survivor benefit insurance and equity investments.

total debt at december31
2009, was $5.7 billion, compared to $6.7 billion at year-end 2008 and $4.9
billion at year-end 2007. as discussed earlier, a portion of the increase in
debt at year-end 2008 was the result of a strategy to build and maintain a cash
buffer in the u.s. given the difficult market environment at that point in
time. total debt was 30 percent of total capital (total capital is defined as
debt plus equity), compared with 39 percent at year-end 2008 and 29 percent at
year-end 2007. the net change in short-term debt is primarily due to commercial
paper activity. in 2009, repayment of debt for maturities greater than 90 days
includes a $400 million medium-term note that matured in november2009 and
also includes repayments of commercial paper. in 2008, the repayment of debt
for maturities greater than 90 days primarily represents debt acquired upon the
acquisition of aearo that was immediately repaid and repayment of commercial
paper with maturities greater than 90 days. in 2007, the repayment of debt for
maturities greater than 90 days is primarily comprised of commercial paper
repayments of approximately $1.15 billion and the november2007 redemption
of approximately $322 million in convertible notes. in 2008, proceeds from debt
primarily include a five-year, $850 million, fixed rate note issued in august2008
with a coupon rate of 4.375%, and a three-year, $800 million, fixed rate note
issued in october2008 with a coupon rate of 4.5% (refer to note 10 for
more information). in 2007, proceeds from debt included long-term debt and
commercial paper issuances totaling approximately $4 billion.
repurchases of common
stock are made to support the companys stock-based employee compensation plans
and for other corporate purposes. in february2007, 3ms board of
directors authorized a two-year share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion for the
period from february12, 2007 to february28, 2009. in 2009, the
company had no broker purchases of treasury stock. in 2008, the company
purchased $1.6 billion in shares. in 2007, the company accelerated purchases of
treasury stock when compared to prior years, buying back $3.2 billion in
shares. in february2009, 3ms board of directors extended this share
repurchase authorization until the remaining amount is fully utilized. as of december31,
2009, approximately $2.6 billion remained available for repurchase. for more
information, refer to the table titled issuer purchases of equity securities
in partii, item 5.
cash dividends paid to
shareholders totaled $1.431 billion ($2.04 per share), $1.398 billion ($2.00
per share) in 2008 and $1.380 billion ($1.92 per share) in 2007. 3m has paid
dividends since 1916. in february2010, the board of directors increased
the quarterly dividend on 3m common stock by 2.9 percent to 52.5 cents per
share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.10 per share. this marked the
52nd consecutive year of dividend increases. other cash flows from financing
activities primarily include distributions to noncontrolling interests, excess
tax benefits from stock-based compensation, changes in cash overdraft balances,
and principal payments for capital leases.

off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations:
as of december31, 2009, the company has not
utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing
arrangements. refer to the section entitled warranties/guarantees in note 14
for discussion of accrued product warranty liabilities and guarantees.
in addition to
guarantees, 3m, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into
agreements that require the company to indemnify either major customers or
suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage
arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel, or
claims alleging that 3m products infringe third-party patents or other
intellectual property. while 3ms maximum exposure under these indemnification
provisions cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have
a material impact on the companys consolidated results of operations or
financial condition.

the companys $350 million of dealer
remarketable securities (classified as current portion of long-term debt) were
remarketed for one year in december2009. long-term debt payments due in
2010 include these $350 million of dealer remarketable securities, which mature
in december2010, and $146 million of floating rate notes. the floating
rate notes are classified as current portion of long-term debt as the result of
put provisions associated with these debt instruments. long-term debt payments
due in 2011 include floating rate notes totaling $100 million as a result of
put provisions. additionally, payments due in 2012 include the $225 million
carrying amount of convertible notes, as a result of put provisions that may or
may not be exercised by note holders.
unconditional
purchase obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services
that is enforceable and legally binding on the company. included in the
unconditional purchase obligations category above are certain obligations
related to take or pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and
utilities. these estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with
terms in excess of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms
of less than one year. many of these commitments relate to take or pay
contracts, in which 3m guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or
services that are sold to customers. the company expects to receive
consideration (products or services) for these unconditional purchase
obligations. contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding
table, but these commitments represent a small part of the companys expected
capital spending in 2010 and beyond. the purchase obligation amounts do not
represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only
those items for which the company is contractually obligated. the majority of
3ms products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional
commitment. for this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable indicator
of the companys expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone basis.
other
obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption entitled unconditional
purchase obligations and other, include the current portion of the liability
for uncertain tax positions under asc 740. the company is not able to
reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the amount by which
the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore, the long-term
portion of the net tax liability of $330 million is excluded from the preceding
table. refer to note 8 for further details.
as
discussed in note 11, the company does not have a required minimum pension
contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2010 and company contributions to
its u.s. and international pension plans are expected to be largely
discretionary in 2010 and future years; therefore, amounts related to these
plans are not included in the preceding table.

financial
instruments
the
company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the ordinary course
of business to manage foreign currency exposure, interest rate risks and commodity
price risks. a financial risk management committee, composed of senior
management, provides oversight for risk management and derivative activities.
this committee determines the companys financial risk policies and objectives,
and provides guidelines for derivative instrument utilization. this committee
also establishes procedures for control and valuation, risk analysis,
counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring and reporting.
the
company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to
hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows
denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing
transactions. the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and
floating rate debt. to help manage borrowing costs, the company may enter into
interest rate swaps. under these arrangements, the company agrees to exchange,
at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest
amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts,
price protection agreements and forward physical contracts.
a
monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the companys exposure to changes
in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss or benefit in
after-tax earnings of financial instruments, derivatives and underlying
exposures outstanding at december31, 2009. the model (third-party bank
dataset) used a 95 percent confidence level over a 12-month time horizon. the
model used analyzed 17 currencies, interest rates related to two currencies,
and five commodities, but does not purport to represent what actually will be
experienced by the company. this model does not include certain hedge
transactions, because the company believes their inclusion would not materially
impact the results. foreign exchange rate risk of loss or benefit decreased in
2009 primarily due to decreases in volatility during 2009, which is one of the
key drivers in the valuation model. the following table summarizes the possible
adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures.

the global exposures related to purchased components and
materials are such that a 1 percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost
or savings of approximately $50 million per year. the global energy exposure is
such that a 10 percent price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings
of approximately $37 million per year. derivative instruments are used to hedge
approximately 1 percent of the purchased components and materials exposure and
are used to hedge approximately 10 percent of this energy exposure.
forward-looking
statements
this
annual report on form10-k, including managements discussion and
analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item 7, contains
forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private securities
litigation reform act of 1995. the company may also make forward-looking
statements in other reports filed with the securities and exchange commission,
in materials delivered to shareholders and in press releases. in addition, the
companys representatives may from time to time make oral forward-looking
statements.
forward-looking
statements relate to future events and typically address the companys expected
future business and financial performance. words such as plan, expect, aim,
believe, project, target, anticipate, intend, estimate, will, should,
could and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such
forward-looking statements. in particular, these include statements about the
companys strategy for growth, product development, market position, future
performance or results of current or anticipated products, interest rates,
foreign exchange rates, financial results, and the outcome of contingencies,
such as legal proceedings. the company assumes no obligation to update or
revise any forward-looking statements.
forward-looking
statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events
and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual future results
and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in
any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors.
discussion of these factors is incorporated by reference from parti, item
1a, risk factors, of this document, and should be considered an integral part
of partii, item 7, managements
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
table of
contents
item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
in the context of item 7a, market risk refers to the risk
of loss arising from adverse changes in financial and derivative instrument
market rates and prices, such as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign
currency exchange rates. the company discusses risk management in various
places throughout this document, including discussions in item 7 concerning
financial condition and liquidity, and financial instruments, and in the notes
to consolidated financial statements (long-term debt and short-term borrowings,
derivatives, fair value measurements, and the derivatives and hedging
activities accounting policy). all derivative activity is governed by written
policies, and a value-at-risk analysis is provided for these derivatives. the
company does not have leveraged derivative positions. however, the company does
have contingently convertible debt that, if conditions for conversion are met,
is convertible into shares of 3m common stock (refer to note 10 in this
document).

managements report on internal control over financial
reporting
management is responsible
for establishing and maintaining an adequate system of internal control over
financial reporting. management conducted an assessment of the companys
internal control over financial reporting based on the framework established by
the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control  integrated framework.
based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of december31,

report of
independent registered public accounting firm
to the stockholders and board of directors of 3m company:
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 3m company and its
subsidiaries (the company) at december31, 2009 and 2008, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended december31, 2009 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also in our opinion, the company maintained,
in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting
as of december31, 2009, based on criteria established in internal control - integrated framework issued by the
committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission (coso). the companys management is responsible for
these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal control over
financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of internal
control over financial reporting, included in managements report on internal
control over financial reporting in the accompanying index. our responsibility is to express opinions on
these financial statements and on the companys internal control over financial
reporting based on our integrated audits.
we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public
company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and
perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial
statements are free of material misstatement and whether effective internal
control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audits of the financial statements
included examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and
disclosures in the financial statements, assessing the accounting principles
used and significant estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation. our
audit of internal control over financial reporting included obtaining an
understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk
that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating the design and
operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk. our audits also included performing such
other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that
our audits provide a reasonable basis for our opinions.
as discussed in note 1 to
the consolidated financial statements, the company changed the manner in which
it accounts for uncertain tax positions in 2007. also as discussed in note1 to the
consolidated financial statements, the company retrospectively changed the
manner in which it accounts for noncontrolling interests in consolidated
subsidiaries and certain convertible debt instruments in 2009.
a companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. a
companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and
procedures that (i)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in
reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and
dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide reasonable
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of
financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting
principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made
only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the
company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or
timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the
companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.
because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

notes to consolidated financial statements
note 1. significant accounting
policies
consolidation: 3m is a
diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a wide
variety of products. all significant subsidiaries are consolidated. all
significant intercompany transactions are eliminated. as used herein, the term 3m
or company refers to 3m company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates
otherwise.
foreign
currency translation: local currencies generally are considered
the functional currencies outside the united states. assets and liabilities for
operations in local-currency environments are translated at year-end exchange
rates. income and expense items are translated at average rates of exchange
prevailing during the year. cumulative translation adjustments are recorded as
a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in shareholders
equity.
the
company has a venezuelan subsidiary with net sales and operating income
representing less than one percent of 3ms related consolidated financial
statement amounts for 2009. regulations in venezuela require the purchase and
sale of foreign currency to be made at an official rate of exchange that is
fixed from time to time by the venezuelan government. certain laws in the
country, however, provide an exemption for the purchase and sale of certain
securities and have resulted in an indirect parallel market through which
companies may obtain foreign currency without having to purchase it from
venezuelas commission for the administration of foreign exchange (cadivi). the
average rate of exchange in the parallel market varies and is less favorable
than the official rate. as of december31, 2009, 3m began use of the
parallel exchange rate for translation of the financial statements of its
venezuelan subsidiary. this change was based on a number of factors including
3ms ability to convert currency in the parallel market, the limited release of
funds from cadivi for the payment of dividends by the venezuelan subsidiary,
and conclusion that 3m will or could use the parallel market for repatriation
of capital or dividends. this change resulted in a decrease in accumulated
other comprehensive income (cumulative translation adjustment) of approximately
$55 million with a corresponding decrease in the translated assets and
liabilities of 3ms venezuelan subsidiary at december31, 2009.
additionally, 3m evaluates the highly inflationary status of venezuelas
economy by considering both the consumer price index (which largely is
associated with the cities of caracas and maracaibo) and the national consumer
price index (developed commencing in 2008 and covering the entire country of
venezuela). under accounting standards codification (asc) 830, foreign currency matters, the reporting
currency of a foreign entitys parent is assumed to be that entitys functional
currency when the economic environment of a foreign entity is highly
inflationary. generally, an economy is considered highly inflationary when its
cumulative inflation is approximately 100 percent or more for the three years
that precede the beginning of a reporting period. the blended cumulative
inflation rate exceeded 100 percent in november2009. accordingly, the
financial statements of the venezuelan subsidiary will be remeasured as if its
functional currency were that of its parent beginning january1, 2010.
this remeasurement will decrease net sales of the venezuelan subsidiary by approximately
two-thirds in 2010 in comparison to 2009 (based on exchange rates as of december31,
2009), but will not otherwise have a material impact on operating income and 3ms
consolidated results of operations.
reclassifications:
certain amounts in the prior years consolidated financial statements
have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
use of
estimates: the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires management
to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets
and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the
date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts of revenues and
expenses during the reporting period. actual results could differ from these
estimates.
subsequent
events: 3m has evaluated subsequent events through the date that the financial
statements were issued, which was february16, 2010, the date of 3ms
annual report on 10-k for the period ended december31, 2009.
cash
and cash equivalents: cash and cash equivalents consist of cash
and temporary investments with maturities of three months or less when
purchased.
investments: investments
primarily include equity and cost method investments and real estate not used
in the business. available-for-sale investments are recorded at fair value.
unrealized gains and losses relating to investments classified as
available-for-sale are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in shareholders equity.
table of
contents
other
assets: other assets include deferred income taxes, product
and other insurance receivables, the cash surrender value of life insurance
policies, and other long-term assets. investments in life insurance are
reported at the amount that could be realized under contract at the balance
sheet date, with any changes in cash surrender value or contract value during
the period accounted for as an adjustment of premiums paid. cash outflows and
inflows associated with life insurance activity are included in purchases of
marketable securities and investments and proceeds from sale of marketable
securities and investments, respectively.
inventories: inventories
are stated at the lower of cost or market, with cost generally determined on a
first-in, first-out basis.
property,
plant and equipment: property, plant and equipment, including
capitalized interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost.
depreciation of property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the
straight-line method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. the
estimated useful lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from 10 to
40 years, with the majority in the range of 20 to 40 years. the estimated
useful lives of machinery and equipment primarily range from three to 15 years,
with the majority in the range of five to 10 years. fully depreciated assets
are retained in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal.
upon disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or
credited to operations. property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment
loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss to be
recorded is calculated by the excess of the assets carrying value over its
fair value. fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow
analysis.
conditional asset retirement obligations:
a liability is
initially recorded at fair value for an asset retirement obligation associated
with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets in the period in which it is
incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made. conditional asset
retirement obligations exist for certain long-term assets of the company. the
obligation is initially measured at fair value using expected present value
techniques. over time the liabilities are accreted for the change in their
present value and the initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the
remaining useful lives of the related assets. the asset retirement obligation
liability was $64 million and $62 million, respectively, at december31,
2009 and 2008.
goodwill: goodwill is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over
the amounts assigned to assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business
combination. goodwill is not amortized. goodwill is tested for impairment
annually, and is tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs
or circumstances change that would indicate the carrying amount may be
impaired. impairment testing for goodwill is done at a reporting unit level,
with all goodwill assigned to a reporting unit. reporting units are one level
below the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units
within the same segment have similar economic characteristics. an impairment
loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting
units net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the
reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry
groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. the price/earnings ratio
is adjusted, if necessary, to take into consideration the market value of the
company.
intangible assets: intangible assets include
patents, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an independent
party. intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain tradenames,
are not amortized. intangible assets with a definite life are amortized on a
straight-line basis, with estimated useful lives ranging from one to 20 years.
indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment annually, and are
tested for impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances
change that would indicate that the carrying amount may be impaired. intangible
assets with a definite life are tested for impairment whenever events or
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may
not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount
of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows used in determining
the fair value of the asset. the amount of the impairment loss to be recorded
is calculated by the excess of the assets carrying value over its fair value.
fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow analysis. costs
related to internally developed intangible assets, such as patents, are
expensed as incurred, primarily in research, development and related expenses.
revenue (sales) recognition: the company sells a wide
range of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has
no material concentration of credit risk. revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards of ownership have substantively
transferred to customers. this condition normally is met when the product has
been delivered or upon performance of services. the company records
estimated reductions to revenue or records
table of
contents
expense
for customer and distributor incentives, primarily comprised of rebates and
free goods, at the time of the initial sale. these sales incentives are
accounted for in accordance with asc 605, revenue
recognition. the estimated reductions of revenue for rebates are
based on the sales terms, historical experience, trend analysis and projected
market conditions in the various markets served. since the company serves
numerous markets, the rebate programs offered vary across businesses, but the
most common incentive relates to amounts paid or credited to customers for
achieving defined volume levels or growth objectives. free goods are accounted
for as an expense and recorded in cost of sales. sales, use, value-added and
other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue.
the
majority of 3ms sales agreements are for standard products and services with
customer acceptance occurring upon delivery of the product or performance of
the service. 3m also enters into agreements that contain multiple elements
(such as equipment, installation and service) or non-standard terms and
conditions. for multiple-element arrangements, 3m recognizes revenue for
delivered elements when it has stand-alone value to the customer, the fair
values of undelivered elements are known, customer acceptance of the delivered
elements has occurred, and there are only customary refund or return rights
related to the delivered elements. in addition to the preceding conditions,
equipment revenue is not recorded until the installation has been completed if
equipment acceptance is dependent upon installation, or if installation is
essential to the functionality of the equipment. installation revenues are not
recorded until installation has been completed. for prepaid service contracts,
sales revenue is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the
contract, unless historical evidence indicates the costs are incurred on other
than a straight-line basis. license fee revenue is recognized as earned, and no
revenue is recognized until the inception of the license term. on occasion,
agreements will contain milestones, or 3m will recognize revenue based on
proportional performance. for these agreements, and depending on the specifics,
3m may recognize revenue upon completion of a substantive milestone, or in
proportion to costs incurred to date compared with the estimate of total costs
to be incurred.
accounts receivable and allowances: trade accounts
receivable are recorded at the invoiced amount and do not bear interest. the
company maintains allowances for bad debts, cash discounts, product returns and
various other items. the allowance for doubtful accounts and product returns is
based on the best estimate of the amount of probable credit losses in existing
accounts receivable and anticipated sales returns. the company determines the
allowances based on historical write-off experience by industry and regional
economic data and historical sales returns. the company reviews the allowance
for doubtful accounts monthly. the company does not have any significant
off-balance-sheet credit exposure related to its customers.
advertising
and merchandising: these costs are charged to operations in the year
incurred, and totaled $414 million in 2009, $468 million in 2008 and $469
million in 2007.
research,
development and related expenses: these costs are charged to
operations in the year incurred and are shown on a separate line of the
consolidated statement of income. research, development and related expenses
totaled $1.293 billion in 2009, $1.404 billion in 2008 and $1.368 billion in
2007. research and development expenses, covering basic scientific research and
the application of scientific advances in the development of new and improved
products and their uses, totaled $838 million in 2009, $851 million in 2008 and
$788 million in 2007. related expenses primarily include technical support
provided by 3m to customers who are using existing 3m products; internally
developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file,
secure and maintain patents; and amortization of acquired patents.
internal-use
software: the company capitalizes direct costs of materials
and services used in the development of internal-use software. amounts
capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over a period of three to
seven years and are reported as a component of machinery and equipment within
property, plant and equipment.
environmental: environmental
expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do
not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. reserves for
liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted
basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than
the completion of feasibility studies or the companys commitment to a plan of
action. environmental expenditures for capital projects that contribute to
current or future operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over
their estimated useful lives.
income
taxes: the provision for income taxes is determined using the asset and
liability approach. under this approach, deferred income taxes represent the
expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between the carrying
amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. the company records a
valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when uncertainty
regarding their realizability exists. as of december31, 2009, no
significant valuation allowances were recorded. as of january1, 2007, the
company adopted new standards related to

accounting
for uncertainty in income taxes. 3m follows this guidance to record
uncertainties and judgments in the application of complex tax regulations in a
multitude of jurisdictions (refer to note 8 for additional information).
earnings per share: the difference in the weighted average 3m shares
outstanding for calculating basic and diluted earnings per share attributable
to 3m common shareholders is the result of the dilution associated with the
companys stock-based compensation plans. certain options outstanding under
these stock-based compensation plans during the years 2009, 2008 and 2007 were
not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share attributable to
3m common shareholders because they would not have had a dilutive effect (54.3
million average options for 2009, 41.0 million average options for 2008, and
21.6 million average options for 2007). as discussed in note 10, the conditions
for conversion related to the companys convertible notes have never been met.
if the conditions for conversion are met, 3m may choose to pay in cash and/or
common stock; however, if this occurs, the company has the intent and ability
to settle this debt security in cash. accordingly, there was no impact on
diluted earnings per share attributable to 3m common shareholders. the computations for basic and diluted
earnings per share for the years ended december31 follow:

stock-based
compensation: the company recognizes compensation expense for both
its general employees stock purchase plan (gespp) and the long-term incentive
plan (ltip). under applicable accounting standards, the fair value of
share-based compensation is determined at the grant date and the recognition of
the related expense is recorded over the period in which the share-based
compensation vests. refer to note 16 for additional information.
comprehensive
income: total comprehensive income and the components of accumulated other
comprehensive income (loss) are presented in the consolidated statements of
changes in equity and comprehensive income. accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) is composed of foreign currency translation effects (including
hedges of net investments in international companies), defined benefit pension
and postretirement plan adjustments, unrealized gains and losses on
available-for-sale debt and equity securities, and unrealized gains and losses
on cash flow hedging instruments.
derivatives
and hedging activities: all derivative instruments within the scope
of asc 815, derivatives and hedging,
are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. the company uses interest rate
swaps, currency and commodity price swaps, and foreign currency forward and
option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign exchange
rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. all hedging instruments
that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and effective as hedges, in
accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles. if the
underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes in fair value of the
related derivatives that have not been settled are recognized in current
earnings. instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are marked to
market with changes recognized in current earnings. the company does not hold
or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes and is not a
party to leveraged derivatives. however, the company does have contingently
convertible debt that, if conditions for conversion are met, is convertible
into shares of 3m common stock (refer to note 10 in this document).
new
accounting pronouncements
in june2009, the financial accounting
standards board (fasb) issued a standard that established the fasb accounting
standards codification (asc) and
amended the hierarchy of generally accepted accounting principles (gaap) such
that the asc became the single source of authoritative nongovernmental u.s.
gaap. the asc did not change current u.s. gaap, but was intended to simplify
user access to all authoritative u.s. gaap by providing all
table of
contents
the authoritative literature related to a particular
topic in one place. all previously existing accounting standard documents were
superseded and all other accounting literature not included in the asc is
considered non-authoritative. new accounting standards issued subsequent to june30,
2009 are communicated by the fasb through accounting standards updates (asus).
for 3m, the asc was effective july1, 2009. this standard did not have an
impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
however, throughout the notes to the consolidated financial statements
references that were previously made to various former authoritative u.s. gaap
pronouncements have been changed to coincide with the appropriate section of
the asc.
in
june2006, the fasb issued an accounting standard codified in asc 740, income taxes, related to accounting for uncertainty in
income taxes. this standard was adopted by 3m effective january1, 2007.
refer to note 8 for additional information concerning this standard.
in september2006, the fasb issued an
accounting standard codified in asc 820, fair value measurements
and disclosures. this standard established a single definition of
fair value and a framework for measuring fair value, set out a fair value
hierarchy to be used to classify the source of information used in fair value
measurements, and required disclosures of assets and liabilities measured at
fair value based on their level in the hierarchy. this standard applies under
other accounting standards that require or permit fair value measurements. 3m
adopted the standard as amended by subsequent fasb standards beginning january1,
2008 on a prospective basis. one of the amendments deferred the effective date
for one year relative to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured
at fair value, but are recognized or disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring
basis. this deferral applied to such items as nonfinancial assets and
liabilities initially measured at fair value in a business combination (but not
measured at fair value in subsequent periods) or nonfinancial long-lived asset
groups measured at fair value for an impairment assessment. these remaining
aspects of the fair value measurement standard were adopted by the company prospectively
beginning january1, 2009 and did not have a material impact on 3ms
consolidated results of operations or financial condition. refer to note 13 for
additional disclosures of assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value on a nonrecurring basis as a result of this adoption.
in
february2007, the fasb issued an accounting standard codified in asc 825,
financial instruments, that permits an
entity to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial
instruments and certain other items at fair value that were not currently
required to be measured at fair value. an entity reports unrealized gains and
losses on items for which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at
each subsequent reporting date. upfront costs and fees related to items for
which the fair value option is elected are recognized in earnings as incurred
and not deferred. this standard also established presentation and disclosure
requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose
different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities.
this standard was effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after november15, 2007 (january1, 2008 for 3m) and
interim periods within those fiscal years. at the effective date, an entity
could elect the fair value option for eligible items that existed at that date.
the entity was required to report the effect of the first remeasurement to fair
value as a cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained
earnings. the company did not elect the fair value option for eligible items
that existed as of january1, 2008.
in
june2007, the fasb ratified a standard regarding the accounting for
nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used in future
research and development activities that requires nonrefundable advance
payments made by the company for future r&d activities to be capitalized
and recognized as an expense as the goods or services are received by the company.
this standard was effective for 3m with respect to new arrangements entered
into beginning january1, 2008 and did not have a material impact on 3ms
consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in december2007, the fasb issued and, in april2009,
amended a new business combinations standard codified within asc 805, which
changed the accounting for business acquisitions. accounting for business
combinations under this standard requires the acquiring entity in a business
combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date fair value as
the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
business combination. certain provisions of this standard impact the
determination of acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a
business combination (including contingent consideration); exclude transaction
costs from acquisition accounting; and change accounting practices for acquisition-related
restructuring costs, in-process research and development, indemnification
assets, and tax benefits. for 3m, this standard was effective for business
combinations and adjustments to an acquired entitys deferred tax asset and
liability balances occurring after december31, 2008. this standard had no
immediate impact upon adoption by 3m, and was applied to the business
combinations disclosed in note 2 that were completed post-2008 and to
applicable adjustments to acquired entity deferred tax items occurring after december31,
2008.
table of
contents
in december2007, the fasb issued a new
standard which established the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling
interests (ncis) in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of
control of subsidiaries. certain provisions of this standard indicate, among
other things, that ncis (previously referred to as minority interests) be
treated as a separate component of equity, not as a liability (as was
previously the case); that increases and decreases in the parents ownership
interest that leave control intact be treated as equity transactions, rather
than as step acquisitions or gains or losses on purchases or sales; and that
losses of a partially owned consolidated subsidiary be allocated to the nci
even when such allocation might result in a deficit balance. this standard also
required changes to certain presentation and disclosure requirements. for 3m,
the standard was effective beginning january1, 2009. the provisions of
the standard were applied to all ncis prospectively, except for the
presentation and disclosure requirements, which were applied retrospectively to
all periods presented. as a result, upon adoption, 3m retroactively
reclassified the minority interest in subsidiaries balance previously
included in the other liabilities section of the consolidated balance sheet
to a new component of equity with respect to ncis in consolidated subsidiaries.
the adoption also impacted certain captions previously used on the consolidated
statement of income, largely identifying net income including nci and net
income attributable to 3m. additional disclosures required by this standard are
also included in note 6. the adoption of this standard did not have a material
impact on 3ms consolidated financial position or results of operations.
in december2007, the fasb ratified a standard
related to accounting for collaborative arrangements which discusses how
parties to a collaborative arrangement (which does not establish a legal entity
within such arrangement) should account for various activities. the standard
indicates that costs incurred and revenues generated from transactions with
third parties (i.e. parties outside of the collaborative arrangement) should be
reported by the collaborators on the respective line items in their income
statements pursuant to asc 605-45, principle agent
considerations. additionally, the guidance provides that income
statement characterization of payments between the participants in a
collaborative arrangement should be based upon existing authoritative
standards; analogy to such standards if not within their scope; or a
reasonable, rational, and consistently applied accounting policy election. this
guidance was effective for 3m beginning january1, 2009 and applied
retrospectively to all periods presented for collaborative arrangements
existing as of the date of adoption. the adoption of this standard did not have
a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.
in march2008, the fasb issued an accounting
standard related to disclosures about derivative instruments and hedging
activities, codified in asc 815, which requires additional disclosures about an
entitys strategies and objectives for using derivative instruments; the
location and amounts of derivative instruments in an entitys financial
statements; how derivative instruments and related hedged items are accounted
for under asc 815, and how derivative instruments and related hedged items
affect its financial position, financial performance, and cash flows. certain
disclosures are also required with respect to derivative features that are credit-risk-related.
the standard was effective for 3m beginning january1, 2009 on a
prospective basis. the additional disclosures required by this standard are
included in note 12.
in
april2008, the fasb issued an accounting standard which amended the list
of factors an entity should consider in developing renewal or extension
assumptions used in determining the useful life of recognized intangible assets
under asc 350, intangibles - goodwill and other.
this new standard applies to (1)intangible assets that are acquired
individually or with a group of other assets and (2)intangible assets
acquired in both business combinations and asset acquisitions. under this
standard, entities estimating the useful life of a recognized intangible asset
must consider their historical experience in renewing or extending similar
arrangements or, in the absence of historical experience, must consider
assumptions that market participants would use about renewal or extension. for
3m, this standard required certain additional disclosures beginning january1,
2009 (which are included in notes 2 and 3) and application to useful life
estimates prospectively for intangible assets acquired after december31,
2008. the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on 3ms consolidated
results of operations or financial condition.
in may2008, the fasb issued an accounting
standard which addresses convertible debt securities that, upon conversion by
the holder, may be settled by the issuer fully or partially in cash (rather than
settled fully in shares) and specifies that issuers of such instruments should
separately account for the liability and equity components in a manner that
reflects the issuers nonconvertible debt borrowing rate when related interest
cost is recognized. this standard was effective for 3m beginning january1,
2009 with retrospective application to all periods presented. this standard
impacted the companys convertible notes (refer to note 10 to the consolidated financial statements for
more detail), and required that additional interest expense essentially
equivalent to the portion of issuance proceeds be retroactively allocated to
the instruments equity component and be recognized over the period from the
convertible notes issuance on november15, 2002 through november15,
2005 (the first date holders of these notes had the ability to put them back to
3m). 3m adopted this standard in january2009. its retrospective
application had no impact on results of operations for periods following 2005,
but on post-2005 consolidated balance sheets, it
table of
contents
resulted in an increase of approximately $22 million
in previously reported opening additional paid in capital and a corresponding
decrease in previously reported opening retained earnings.
in
early october2008, the fasb issued an accounting standard codified in asc
820, fair value measurements and disclosures,
which illustrated key considerations in determining the fair value of a
financial asset in an inactive market. this standard was effective for 3m
beginning with the quarter ended september30, 2008. its additional
guidance was incorporated in the measurements of fair value of applicable
financial assets disclosed in note 13 and did not have a material impact on 3ms
consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in november2008, the fasb ratified a standard related to certain
equity method investment accounting considerations. the standard indicates,
among other things, that transaction costs for an investment should be included
in the cost of the equity-method investment (and not expensed) and shares
subsequently issued by the equity-method investee that reduce the investors
ownership percentage should be accounted for as if the investor had sold a
proportionate share of its investment, with gains or losses recorded through
earnings. for 3m, the standard was effective for transactions occurring after december31,
2008. the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on 3ms
consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in november2008, the fasb ratified an accounting standard related
to intangible assets acquired in a business combination or asset acquisition
that an entity does not intend to use or intends to hold to prevent others from
obtaining access (a defensive intangible asset). under the standard a defensive
intangible asset needs to be accounted for as a separate unit of accounting and
would be assigned a useful life based on the period over which the asset
diminishes in value. for 3m, the standard was effective for transactions
occurring after december31, 2008. the company considered this standard in
terms of intangible assets acquired in business combinations or asset
acquisitions that closed after december31, 2008.
in december2008, the fasb issued an accounting
standard regarding a companys disclosures about postretirement benefit plan
assets. this standard requires additional disclosures about plan assets for
sponsors of defined benefit pension and postretirement plans including expanded
information regarding investment strategies, major categories of plan assets,
and concentrations of risk within plan assets. additionally, this standard
requires disclosures similar to those required for fair value measurements and
disclosures under asc 820 with respect to the fair value of plan assets such as
the inputs and valuation techniques used to measure fair value and information
with respect to classification of plan assets in terms of the hierarchy of the
source of information used to determine their value. for 3m, the disclosures
under this standard are required beginning with the annual period ended december31,
2009. the additional disclosures are included in note 11.
in april2009, the fasb issued an accounting
standard which provides guidance on (1)estimating the fair value of an
asset or liability when the volume and level of activity for the asset or
liability have significantly declined and (2)identifying transactions
that are not orderly. the standard also amended certain disclosure provisions
for fair value measurements and disclosures in asc 820 to require, among other
things, disclosures in interim periods of the inputs and valuation techniques
used to measure fair value as well as disclosure of the hierarchy of the source
of underlying fair value information on a disaggregated basis by specific major
category of investment. for 3m, this standard was effective prospectively
beginning april1, 2009. the adoption of this standard did not have a
material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.
in april2009, the fasb issued an accounting
standard which modifies the requirements for recognizing other-than-temporarily
impaired debt securities and changes the existing impairment model for such
securities. the standard also requires additional disclosures for both annual
and interim periods with respect to both debt and equity securities. under the
standard, impairment of debt securities is considered other-than-temporary if
an entity (1)intends to sell the security, (2)more likely than not
will be required to sell the security before recovering its cost, or (3)does
not expect to recover the securitys entire amortized cost basis (even if the
entity does not intend to sell). the standard further indicates that, depending
on which of the above factor(s)causes the impairment to be considered
other-than-temporary, (1)the entire shortfall of the securitys fair
value versus its amortized cost basis or (2)only the credit loss portion
would be recognized in earnings while the remaining shortfall (if any) would be
recorded in other comprehensive income. the standard requires entities to
initially apply its provisions to previously other-than-temporarily impaired
debt securities existing as of the date of initial adoption by making a
cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings in the
period of adoption. the cumulative-effect adjustment potentially reclassifies
the noncredit portion of a previously other-than-temporarily impaired debt
security held as of the date of initial adoption from retained earnings to
accumulated other comprehensive income. for 3m, this standard was effective
beginning april1, 2009. the adoption of this standard did not have a
material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial
condition. additional disclosures required by this standard are included in
note 9.

in
april2009, the fasb issued an accounting standard regarding interim
disclosures about fair value of financial instruments. the standard essentially
expands the disclosure about fair value of financial instruments that were
previously required only annually to also be required for interim period
reporting. in addition, the standard requires certain additional disclosures
regarding the methods and significant assumptions used to estimate the fair
value of financial instruments. this standard was effective for 3m beginning april1,
2009 on a prospective basis. the additional disclosures required by this
standard are included in note 13.
in
may2009, the fasb issued a new accounting standard regarding subsequent
events. this standard incorporates into authoritative accounting literature
certain guidance that already existed within generally accepted auditing
standards, with the requirements concerning recognition and disclosure of
subsequent events remaining essentially unchanged. this guidance addresses
events which occur after the balance sheet date but before the issuance of
financial statements. under the new standard, as under previous practice, an
entity must record the effects of subsequent events that provide evidence about
conditions that existed at the balance sheet date and must disclose but not
record the effects of subsequent events which provide evidence about conditions
that did not exist at the balance sheet date. this standard added an additional
required disclosure relative to the date through which subsequent events have
been evaluated and whether that is the date on which the financial statements
were issued. for 3m, this standard was effective beginning april1, 2009.
the additional disclosures required by this standard are included in note 1.
in
june2009, the fasb issued a new standard regarding the accounting for
transfers of financial assets amending the existing guidance on transfers of
financial assets to, among other things, eliminate the qualifying
special-purpose entity concept, include a new unit of account definition that
must be met for transfers of portions of financial assets to be eligible for
sale accounting, clarify and change the derecognition criteria for a transfer
to be accounted for as a sale, and require significant additional disclosure.
for 3m, this standard is effective for new transfers of financial assets
beginning january1, 2010. because 3m historically does not have
significant transfers of financial assets, the adoption of this standard is not
expected to have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations
or financial condition.
in june2009, the
fasb issued a new standard that revises the consolidation guidance for
variable-interest entities. the modifications include the elimination of the
exemption for qualifying special purpose entities, a new approach for
determining who should consolidate a variable-interest entity, and changes to
when it is necessary to reassess who should consolidate a variable-interest
entity. for 3m, this standard is effective january1, 2010. the company
does not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on 3ms
consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in
august2009, the fasb issued asu no.2009-05, measuring
liabilities at fair value, which provides additional guidance on how
companies should measure liabilities at fair value under asc 820. the asu
clarifies that the quoted price for an identical liability should be used.
however, if such information is not available, a entity may use the quoted
price of an identical liability when traded as an asset, quoted prices for
similar liabilities or similar liabilities traded as assets, or another
valuation technique (such as the market or income approach). the asu also
indicates that the fair value of a liability is not adjusted to reflect the
impact of contractual restrictions that prevent its transfer and indicates
circumstances in which quoted prices for an identical liability or quoted price
for an identical liability traded as an asset may be considered level 1 fair
value measurements (see note 13 for a description of level 1 measurements). for
3m, this asu was effective october1, 2009. the adoption of this asu did
not have a material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or
financial condition.
in september2009, the
fasb issued asu no.2009-12, investments in certain
entities that calculate net asset value per share (or its equivalent),
that amends asc 820 to provide guidance on measuring the fair value of certain
alternative investments such as hedge funds, private equity funds and venture
capital funds. the asu indicates that, under certain circumstances, the fair
value of such investments may be determined using net asset value (nav) as a
practical expedient, unless it is probable the investment will be sold at
something other than nav. in those situations, the practical expedient cannot
be used and disclosure of the remaining actions necessary to complete the sale
is required. the asu also requires additional disclosures of the attributes of
all investments within the scope of the new guidance, regardless of whether an
entity used the practical expedient to measure the fair value of any of its
investments. the
disclosure provisions of this asu are not applicable to an employers
disclosures about pension and other postretirement benefit plan assets. 3m does
not have any significant direct investments within
the scope of asu no.2009-12, but certain plan assets of the companys
benefit plans are valued based on nav as indicated in note 11. for 3m, this asu
was effective october1, 2009. the adoption of this asu did not have a
material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.
table of contents
in october2009, the
fasb issued asu no.2009-13, multiple-deliverable
revenue arrangementsa consensus of the fasb emerging issues task force,
that provides amendments to the criteria for separating consideration in
multiple-deliverable arrangements. as a result of these amendments, multiple-deliverable
revenue arrangements will be separated in
more circumstances than under existing u.s. gaap. the asu does this by
establishing a selling price hierarchy for determining the selling price of a
deliverable. the selling price used for each deliverable will be based on
vendor-specific objective evidence if available, third-party evidence if
vendor-specific objective evidence is not available, or estimated selling price
if neither vendor-specific objective evidence nor third-party evidence is available.
a vendor will be required to determine its best estimate of selling price in a
manner that is consistent with that used to determine the price to sell the
deliverable on a standalone basis. this asu also eliminates the residual method
of allocation and will require that arrangement consideration be allocated at
the inception of the arrangement to all deliverables using the relative selling
price method, which allocates any discount in the overall arrangement
proportionally to each deliverable based on its relative selling price.
expanded disclosures of qualitative and quantitative information regarding
application of the multiple-deliverable revenue arrangement guidance are also
required under the asu. the asu does not apply to arrangements for which industry
specific allocation and measurement guidance exists, such as long-term
construction contracts and software transactions. for 3m, asu no.2009-13
is effective beginning january1, 2011. 3m may elect to adopt the
provisions prospectively to new or materially modified arrangements beginning
on the effective date or retrospectively for all periods presented. the company
is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on 3ms consolidated
results of operations and financial condition.
in
october2009, the fasb issued asu no.2009-14, certain
revenue arrangements that include software elementsa consensus of the fasb
emerging issues task force, that reduces the types of transactions
that fall within the current scope of software revenue recognition guidance.
existing software revenue recognition guidance requires that its provisions be
applied to an entire arrangement when the sale of any products or services
containing or utilizing software when the software is considered more than
incidental to the product or service. as a result of the amendments included in
asu no.2009-14, many tangible products and services that rely on software
will be accounted for under the multiple-element arrangements revenue
recognition guidance rather than under the software revenue recognition
guidance. under the asu, the following components would be excluded from the
scope of software revenue recognition guidance:
the tangible element of the product, software products bundled with tangible
products where the software components and non-software components function
together to deliver the products essential functionality, and undelivered
components that relate to software that is essential to the tangible products
functionality. the asu also provides guidance on how to allocate transaction
consideration when an arrangement contains both deliverables within the scope
of software revenue guidance (software deliverables) and deliverables not
within the scope of that guidance (non-software deliverables). for 3m, asu no.2009-14
is effective beginning january1, 2011. 3m may elect to adopt the
provisions prospectively to new or materially modified arrangements beginning
on the effective date or retrospectively for all periods presented. however, 3m
must elect the same transition method for this guidance as that chosen for asu no.2009-13.
the company is currently evaluating the impact of this standard on 3ms
consolidated results of operations and financial condition.
in
january2010, the fasb issued asu no.2010-6, improving
disclosures about fair value measurements, that amends existing
disclosure requirements under asc 820 by adding required disclosures about
items transferring into and out of levels 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy;
adding separate disclosures about purchase, sales, issuances, and settlements
relative to level 3 measurements; and clarifying, among other things, the
existing fair value disclosures about the level of disaggregation. for 3m this
asu is effective for the first quarter of 2010, except for the requirement to
provide level 3 activity of purchases, sales, issuances, and settlements on a
gross basis, which is effective beginning the first quarter of 2011. since this
standard impacts disclosure requirements only, its adoption will not have a
material impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.

3. goodwill and intangible assets
purchased goodwill from the four acquisitions that closed
in 2009 totaled $15 million, $9 million of which is deductible for tax
purposes. purchased goodwill from acquisitions totaled $1.392 billion in 2008,
$34 million of which is deductible for tax purposes. the acquisition activity
in the following table also includes the impacts of adjustments to the
preliminary allocation of purchase price and certain acquisition costs and
contingent consideration for pre-2009 acquisitions, which reduced goodwill by
$40 million in 2009. the
amounts in the translation and other column in the following table primarily
relate to changes in foreign currency exchange rates, except for the $77
million decrease in goodwill related to the second-quarter 2008 sale of 3ms
highjump software business (included in the safety, security and protection
services business). the goodwill balance by business segment follows:

accounting standards require that goodwill be tested for
impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances such as a
change in reporting units or the testing of recoverability of a significant
asset group within a reporting unit. at 3m, reporting units generally
correspond to a division.
as discussed in note 17 to
the consolidated financial statements, effective in the first quarter of 2009,
3m made certain product moves between its business segments. since there were
no material changes in goodwill balances between business segments, amounts
presented in the preceding table have not been reclassified. for those changes
that resulted in reporting unit changes, the company applied the relative fair
value method to determine the impact to reporting units. during the first
quarter of 2009, the company completed its assessment of any potential goodwill
impairment for reporting units impacted by this new structure and determined
that no impairment existed.
as discussed in note 13,
in june2009, 3m tested the long lived assets grouping associated with the
u.k. passport production activity of 3ms security systems division for
recoverability. this circumstance required the company to also test goodwill
for impairment at the reporting unit (security systems division) level. 3m
completed its assessment of potential goodwill impairment for this reporting
unit and determined that no goodwill impairment existed as of june30,
2009. the company also completed its annual goodwill impairment test in the
fourth quarter of 2009 for all reporting units and determined that no
impairment existed. in addition, the company had no impairments of goodwill in
prior years.

note 4. restructuring actions and exit activities
restructuring actions and exit activities generally
include significant actions involving employee-related severance charges,
contract termination costs, and impairment of assets associated with such
actions.
employee-related
severance charges are largely based upon distributed employment policies and
substantive severance plans. these charges are reflected in the quarter in
which management approves the associated actions, the actions are probable, and
the amounts are estimable. severance amounts for which affected employees were
required to render service in order to receive benefits at their termination
dates were measured at the date such benefits were communicated to the applicable
employees and recognized as expense over the employees remaining service
periods.
contract
termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to terminate a contract
before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the time the company
provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will continue to be incurred
under the contract for its remaining term without economic benefit to the
company. as discussed in accounting policies in note 1, asset impairment
charges related to intangible assets and property, plant and equipment reflect
the excess of the assets carrying values over their fair values.
the following provides information, respectively,
concerning the companys 2009/2008 restructuring actions, its 2007/2006
restructuring actions, and its exit activities during 2008 and 2007.
2009 and 2008
restructuring actions:
during
the fourth quarter of 2008 and the first nine months of 2009, management
approved and committed to undertake certain restructuring actions. due to the
rapid decline in global business activity in the fourth quarter of 2008 and
into the first three quarters of 2009, 3m aggressively reduced its cost
structure and rationalized several facilities, including manufacturing,
technical and office facilities. these actions included all geographies, with
particular attention in the developed areas of the world that have and are
experiencing large declines in business activity, and included the following:
during the
fourth quarter of 2008, 3m announced the elimination of more than 2,400
positions. of these
employment reductions, about 31 percent were in the united states, 29 percent
in europe, 24 percent in latin america and canada, and 16 percent in the asia
pacific area. these restructuring
actions resulted in a fourth-quarter 2008 pre-tax charge of $229 million, with
$186 million for employee-related items/benefits and other, and $43 million
related to fixed asset impairments. the preceding charges were recorded
in cost of sales ($84 million), selling, general and administrative expenses
($135 million), and research, development and related expenses ($10 million).
cash payments in 2008 related to this restructuring were not material.
during the first quarter of 2009, 3m announced the
elimination of approximately 1,200 positions. of these employment reductions,
about 43 percent were in the united states, 36 percent in latin america, 16
percent in europe and 5 percent in the asia pacific area. these restructuring actions resulted in a
first-quarter 2009 pre-tax charge of $67 million, with $61 million for
employee-related items/benefits and $6 million related to fixed asset
impairments. the preceding charges were recorded in cost of sales ($17
million), selling, general and administrative
expenses ($47 million), and research, development and related expenses ($3
million).
during the second quarter of 2009, 3m announced the
permanent reduction of approximately 900 positions, the majority of which were concentrated in the united states,
western europe and japan. in the united states, another 700 people accepted a
voluntary early retirement incentive program offer. as discussed in note 11, a
$21 million non-cash charge was related to the approximately 700 participants
who accepted the voluntary early retirement incentive program offer. of these
aggregate employment reductions, about 66 percent were in the united states, 17
percent in the asia pacific area, 14 percent in europe and 3 percent in latin
america and canada. these restructuring
actions in total resulted in a second-quarter 2009 pre-tax charge of $116
million, with $103 million for employee-related items/benefits and $13 million
related to fixed asset impairments. the preceding charges were recorded
in cost of sales ($68 million), selling, general and administrative expenses ($44 million), and research, development
and related expenses ($4 million).
table
of contents
during the third quarter of 2009, 3m
announced the elimination of approximately 200 positions, with the majority of those occurring in western europe
and, to a lesser extent, the united states. these restructuring actions, including a non-cash charge related to a
pension settlement in japan (discussed further in note 11), resulted in a
third-quarter 2009 net pre-tax charge of $26 million for employee-related
items/benefits and other, which is net of $7 million of adjustments to prior
2008 and 2009 restructuring actions. the preceding charges were recorded
in cost of sales ($25 million) and research, development and related expenses
($1 million).

2007 and 2006 restructuring actions:
during the fourth quarter of 2006 and the first six
months of 2007, management approved and committed to undertake the following restructuring
actions:
pharmaceuticals business
actions  employee-related, asset impairment and other costs pertaining to the
companys exit of its branded pharmaceuticals operations. these costs included
severance and benefits for pharmaceuticals business employees who are not
obtaining employment with the buyers as well as impairment charges associated
with certain assets not transferred to the buyers.
overhead reduction actions
employee-related costs for severance and benefits, costs associated with
actions to reduce the companys cost structure.

impairments, certain contractual obligations, and expenses from the exit of
certain product lines.
in
connection with this targeted 2007/2006 restructuring plan, the company
eliminated a total of approximately 1,900 positions from various functions
within the company. approximately 390 positions were pharmaceuticals business
employees, approximately 960 positions related primarily to corporate staff
overhead reductions, and approximately 550 positions were business-specific
reduction actions. of the 1,900 employment reductions, about 58 percent are in
the united states, 21 percent in europe, 12 percent in latin america and
canada, and 9 percent in the asia pacific area. as a result of the
second-quarter 2007 phaseout of operations at a new jersey roofing granule
facility and the sale of the companys opticom priority control systems and
canoga traffic detection businesses, the company eliminated approximately 100
additional positions.

non-cash
employee-related changes in 2007 primarily relate to special termination
pension and medical benefits granted to certain u.s. eligible employees. these
pension and medical benefits were reflected as a component of the benefit
obligation of the companys pension and medical plans as of december31,
2007. in addition, these changes also reflect non-cash stock option expense due
to the reclassification of certain employees age 50 and older to retiree
status, resulting in a modification of their original stock option awards for
accounting purposes.

business-specific
asset impairment charges for 2007 totaled $35 million. this included charges of
$24 million related to property, plant and equipment associated with the
companys decision to phaseout operations at a new jersey roofing granule
facility (safety, security and protection services segment) and charges of $11
million ($10 million related to property, plant and equipment and $1 million
related to intangible assets) related to the companys decision to close an
electro and communications facility in wisconsin.
exit activities:
during
the second and third quarters of 2008, management approved and committed to
undertake certain exit activities, which resulted in a pre-tax charge of $68
million. these charges primarily related to employee-related liabilities and
fixed asset impairments. during the fourth quarter 2008, a pre-tax benefit of
$10 million was recorded, which primarily related to adjustments to
employee-related liabilities for second and third-quarter 2008 exit activities.
in total for 2008, these actions resulted in pre-tax charges for industrial and
transportation ($26 million); display and graphics ($18 million); health care
($9 million); safety, security and protection services ($3 million); and
corporate and unallocated ($2 million). these charges were recorded in cost of
sales ($38 million), selling, general and administrative expenses ($17
million), and research, development and related expenses ($3 million).
during
the second half of 2007, the company recorded net pre-tax charges of $45
million related to exit activities. these charges related to employee
reductions and fixed asset impairments, including the consolidation of certain
flexible circuit manufacturing operations ($23 million recorded in the electro and
communications segment) and other actions, primarily in the display and
graphics segment and industrial and transportation segment. these charges were
recorded in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses and
research, development and related expenses.

reclassification
adjustments are made to avoid double counting in comprehensive income items
that are also recorded as part of net income. reclassifications to earnings
from accumulated other comprehensive income attributable to 3m that related to
pension and postretirement expense in the income statement were $141 million
pre-tax ($92 million after-tax) in 2009, $79 million pre-tax ($52 million
after-tax) in 2008, and $198 million pre-tax ($123 million after-tax) in 2007.
these pension and postretirement expense amounts are shown in the table in note
11 as amortization of transition (asset) obligation, amortization of prior
service cost (benefit) and amortization of net actuarial (gain) loss. cash flow
hedging instruments reclassifications are provided in note 12.
reclassifications to earnings from accumulated other comprehensive income
attributable to 3m for debt and equity securities primarily relate to a loss of
approximately $2 million pre-tax for 2009, as shown in the auction rate
securities table in note 13, a loss of approximately $6 million pre-tax ($4
million after tax) for 2008, and was not material for 2007. other
reclassification adjustments were not material. income taxes are not provided
for foreign translation relating to permanent investments in international
subsidiaries, but tax effects within cumulative translation does include
impacts from items such as net investment hedge transactions.

transfer of ownership interest
involving non-wholly owned subsidiaries
during 2009, a wholly
owned subsidiary that, in turn, owned a portion of the companys majority owned
sumitomo 3m limited entity, was transferred to another subsidiary that is
majority, rather than wholly, owned. as a result of the transaction, 3ms
effective ownership in sumitomo 3m limited was reduced from 75 percent to 71.5
percent. the transfer was effected to further align activities in the associated
region and to simplify the companys ownership structure. because the company
retained its controlling interest in the subsidiaries involved, the transfer
resulted in a decrease in 3m company shareholders equity and an increase in
noncontrolling interest of $81 million. the following table summarizes the
effects of this transfer on equity attributable to 3m company shareholders.

defined benefit pension plan in shares of the companys common stock. in 2007,
3m purchased certain assets of diamond productions,inc. for approximately
150 thousand shares of 3m common stock, which has a market value of
approximately $13 million at the acquisitions measurement date. liabilities

the company files income
tax returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign
jurisdictions. with few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to u.s.
federal, state and local, or non-u.s. income tax examinations by tax
authorities for years before 2002.
the internal revenue
service (irs) completed its examination of the companys u.s. federal income
tax returns for the years 2002 through 2004 in the first quarter of 2008. the
outcome of the 2002 through 2004 audit cycle impacted the 2001 tax year, which
was settled in the second quarter of 2008. the irs completed its field
examination of the companys u.s. federal income tax returns for the years 2005
through 2007 in the fourth quarter of 2009. the company has protested certain
irs positions within these tax years and is expected to enter the
administrative appeals process with the irs during 2010. currently, the company
is under examination by the irs for its u.s. federal income tax returns for the
years 2008 and 2009. it is anticipated that the irs will complete its
examination of the company for 2008 by the end of the first quarter of 2010 and
for 2009 by the end of the first quarter of 2011. as
table of contents
of december31,
2009, the irs has not proposed any significant adjustments to the companys tax
positions for which the company is not adequately reserved. payments relating
to any proposed assessments arising from the 2005 through 2009 audits may not
be made until a final agreement is reached between the company and the irs on
such assessments or upon a final resolution resulting from the administrative
appeals process or judicial action. in addition to the u.s. federal
examination, there is also limited audit activity in several u.s. state and
foreign jurisdictions.
3m anticipates changes to
the companys uncertain tax positions due to the closing of the various audit
years mentioned above. currently, the company is not able to reasonably
estimate the amount by which the liability for unrecognized tax benefits will
increase or decrease during the next 12 months as a result of the ongoing
income tax authority examinations.
the company adopted the
new guidance relating to accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, in
accordance with asc 740, income taxes,
on january1, 2007. upon adoption, the company recognized an immaterial
increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted
for as a reduction to the january1, 2007, balance of retained earnings. a
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax
benefits (utb) is as follows:

the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax
rate by $425 million as of december31, 2009, and $334 million as of both december31,
2008 and december31, 2007. the ending net utb results from adjusting the
gross balance for items such as federal, state, and non-u.s. deferred items,
interest and penalties, and deductible taxes. the net utb is included as
components of other current assets, other assets, and other liabilities within
the consolidated balance sheet.
the company recognizes
interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax
expense. the company recognized in the consolidated statement of income on a
gross basis approximately $6 million, $8 million, and $9 million of expense in
2009, 2008, and 2007, respectively. at december31, 2009 and december31,
2008, accrued interest and penalties in the consolidated balance sheet on a
gross basis were $53 million and $47 million, respectively. included in these
interest and penalty amounts are interest and penalties related to tax
positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain but for which
there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. because of the
impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties, the
disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the annual
effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the taxing
authority to an earlier period.
the company made
discretionary contributions to its u.s. qualified pension plan of $710 million
in 2009, $200 million in 2008, and $200 million in 2007. in addition, the
company made contributions to its international pension plans of $504 million
in 2009, $186 million in 2008, and $151 million in 2007. the current income tax
provision includes a benefit for the pension contributions; the deferred tax
provision includes a cost for the related temporary difference.
as a result of certain
employment commitments and capital investments made by 3m, income from
manufacturing activities in taiwan, china, brazil, korea, and singapore is
subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt from tax for years
through 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, and 2023, respectively. the income tax benefits
attributable to the tax status of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $50
million (7 cents per diluted share) in 2009, $44 million (6 cents per diluted
share) in 2008, and $47 million (6cents per diluted share) in 2007.

the company has not
provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to international
companies that have been considered to be reinvested indefinitely. these
earnings relate to ongoing operations and were approximately $5.6 billion as of
december31, 2009. because of the availability of u.s. foreign tax
credits, it is not practicable to determine the income tax liability that would
be payable if such earnings were not indefinitely reinvested.

classification
of marketable securities as current or non-current is dependent upon managements
intended holding period, the securitys maturity date and liquidity
considerations based on market conditions. if management intends to hold the
securities for longer than one year as of the balance sheet date, they are
classified as non-current. at december31, 2009, gross unrealized losses
totaled approximately $12 million (pre-tax), while gross unrealized gains
totaled approximately $3 million (pre-tax). at december31, 2008, gross
unrealized losses totaled approximately $30 million (pre-tax), while gross
unrealized gains were not material. gross realized gains on sales or maturities
of marketable securities were not material in 2009, $5 million in 2008 and $7
million in 2007. gross realized losses on sales or maturities of marketable
securities were $3 million for 2009 and were not material for 2008 and 2007.
cost of securities sold use the first in, first out (fifo) method. since these
marketable securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, changes
in fair value will flow through other comprehensive income, with amounts
reclassified out of other comprehensive income into earnings upon sale or other-than-temporary
impairment.
3m reviews impairments
associated with the above in accordance with the measurement guidance provided
by asc 320, investments-debt and equity securities,
when determining the classification of the impairment as temporary or other-than-temporary.
in addition, as discussed in note 1, beginning in april2009, the company
considers the new accounting standard
with respect to the determination of other-than-temporary impairments
associated with investments in debt securities. a temporary impairment
charge results in an unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive
income component of shareholders equity. such an unrealized loss does not
reduce net income attributable to 3m for the applicable accounting period
because the loss is not viewed as other-than-temporary. the factors evaluated to differentiate
between temporary and other-than-temporary include the projected future cash
flows, credit ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the
underlying collateral, as well as
table of
contents
the factors included in
the impairment model for debt securities included in the new standard relating
to other-than temporary impairments, as described in note 1.
the
balance at december31, 2009 for marketable securities and short-term
investments by contractual maturity are shown below. actual maturities may
differ from contractual maturities because the issuers of the securities may
have the right to prepay obligations without prepayment penalties.

3m
has a diversified marketable securities portfolio of $1.569 billion as of december31,
2009. within this portfolio, current and long-term asset-backed securities
(estimated fair value of $705 million) are primarily comprised of interests in
automobile loans and credit cards. at december31, 2009, the asset-backed
securities credit ratings were aaa or a-1+, with the exception of three
securities rated aa with a fair market value of less than $12 million, and one
security rated a with a fair market value of less than $1 million.
historically,
3ms marketable securities portfolio included auction rate securities that
represented interests in investment grade credit default swaps; however, the
estimated fair value of auction rate securities are $5 million and $1 million
as of december31, 2009 and december31, 2008, respectively. gross
unrealized losses within accumulated other comprehensive income related to
auction rate securities totaled $8 million and $16 million (pre-tax) as of december31,
2009 and december31, 2008, respectively. as of december31, 2009, auction rate securities
associated with these balances have been in a loss position for more than 12
months. since the second half of 2007, these auction rate securities failed to
auction due to sell orders exceeding buy orders. liquidity for these
auction-rate securities is typically provided by an auction process that resets
the applicable interest rate at pre-determined intervals, usually every 7, 28,
35, or 90 days. the funds associated with failed auctions will not be
accessible until a successful auction occurs or a buyer is found outside of the
auction process. 3m
recorded other-than-temporary impairment charges associated with these
auction rate securities that reduced pre-tax income by approximately $9 million
in 2008 and $8 million 2007. in addition, 3m recognized a loss in 2009 when it
reclassified an unrealized loss of $2 million from other comprehensive income
in connection with the sale of its position in one of these auction rate
securities. refer to note 13 for a table that reconciles the beginning and
ending balances of auction rate securities.

the companys $350 million of dealer
remarketable securities (classified as current portion of long-term debt) were
remarketed for one year in december2009. long-term debt payments due in
2010 include these $350 million of dealer remarketable securities, which mature
in december2010, and $146 million of floating rate notes. the floating
rate notes are classified as current portion of long-term debt as the result of
put provisions associated with these debt instruments. long-term debt payments
due in 2011 include floating rate notes totaling $100 million as a
table of
contents
result
of put provisions. additionally, payments due in 2012 include the $225 million
carrying amount of convertible notes, as a result of put provisions.
the
esop debt, which matured in 2009, was serviced by dividends on stock held by
the esop and by company contributions. these contributions were not reported as
interest expense, but were reported as an employee benefit expense in the
consolidated statement of income. refer to note 15 for more detail on the esop.
other borrowings included debt held by 3ms international companies and
floating rate notes in the united states, with the long-term portion of this
debt primarily composed of u.s. dollar floating rate debt.
the
company has an aa- credit rating, with a stable outlook, from standard&
poors and an aa2 credit rating, with a stable outlook, from moodys investors
service. at december31, 2009, the $350 million of dealer remarketable
securities had ratings triggers (bbb-/baa3 or lower) that would require
repayment of debt. in addition, under the companys $1.5-billion five-year
credit facility agreement that was effective april30, 2007, 3m is
required to maintain its ebitda to interest ratio as of the end of each fiscal
quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. this is calculated (as defined in the
agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total ebitda for the four consecutive
quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same
period. at december31, 2009, this ratio was approximately 27 to 1. at december31,
2009, available short-term committed lines of credit, including the preceding
$1.5 billion five-year credit facility, totaled approximately $1.593 billion,
of which approximately $145 million was utilized in connection with normal
business activities. debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
the floating rate notes due
in 2044 have an annual put feature. according to the terms, holders can require
3m to repurchase the securities at a price of 98 percent of par value each decemberfrom
2005 through 2008, at 99 percent of par value from 2009 through 2013, and at
100 percent of par value from 2014 and every anniversary thereafter until final
maturity in december2044. in december2009 and 2008, the company was
required to repurchase an immaterial amount of principal on this bond.
the
company has a well-known seasoned issuer shelf registration statement,
effective february17, 2009, which registers an indeterminate amount of
debt or equity securities for future sales. no securities have been issued
under this shelf. the company intends to use the proceeds from future securities
sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes. in connection with a prior
well-known seasoned issuer shelf registration, in june2007 the company
established a $3 billion medium-term notes program. three debt securities have
been issued under this medium-term notes program. first, in december2007,
3m issued a five-year, $500 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of
4.65%. second, in august2008, 3m issued a five-year, $850 million, fixed
rate note with a coupon rate of 4.375%. third, in october2008, the
company issued a three-year $800 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of
4.50%. the company entered into an interest rate swap to convert this $800
million note to a floating rate.
the company also issued
notes under an earlier $1.5 billion medium-term note program. in march2007,
the company issued a 30-year, $750 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate
of 5.70%. in november2006, 3m issued a three-year, $400 million, fixed
rate note. the company entered into an interest rate swap to convert this to a
rate based on a floating libor index. both the note and related swap matured in
november2009. in december2004, 3m issued a 40-year, $62 million
floating rate note ($60 million outstanding at december31, 2009), with
the rate based on a floating libor index. this earlier $1.5 billion medium term
note program was replaced by the $3 billion program established in june2007.
in
july2007, 3m issued a seven year 5.0% fixed rate eurobond for an amount
of 750 million euros (book value of approximately $1.123 billion in u.s.
dollars at december31, 2009). upon debt issuance in july2007, 3m
completed a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on a notional amount of 400
million euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed interest rate
eurobond obligation. in december2007, 3m reopened the existing seven year
5.0% fixed rate eurobond for an additional amount of 275 million euros (book
value of approximately $398 million in u.s. dollars at december31, 2009).
this security was issued at a premium and was subsequently consolidated with
the original security on january15, 2008.
3m
may redeem its 30-year zero-coupon senior notes (the convertible notes) at
any time in whole or in part at the accreted conversion price; however,
bondholders may convert upon notification of redemption each of the notes into
9.4602 shares of 3m common stock (which 3m would intend to payout in cash).
holders of the 30-year zero-coupon senior notes have the option to require 3m
to purchase their notes at accreted value on november21 in the years
2005, 2007, 2012, 2017, 2022 and 2027. in november2005, 22,506 of the
639,000 in outstanding bonds were redeemed, resulting in a payout from 3m of
approximately $20 million. in november2007, an additional 364,598 outstanding
bonds were redeemed resulting in a payout from 3m of approximately $322
million. these payouts reduced the convertible notes face value at maturity to
$252 million, which equates to a book value of approximately $225 million at december31,
2009. as disclosed in a form8-k in november2005, 3m amended the
table of contents
terms
of these securities to pay cash at a rate of 2.40% per annum of the principal
amount at maturity of the companys convertible notes, which equated to 2.75%
per annum of the notes accreted value on november21, 2005. the cash
interest payments were made semiannually in arrears on may22, 2006, november22,
2006, may22, 2007 and november22, 2007 to holders of record on the
15th calendar day preceding each such interest payment date. effective november22,
2007, the effective interest rate reverted back to the original yield of 0.50%.
3m
originally sold $639 million in aggregate face amount of these convertible
notes on november15, 2002, which are convertible into shares of 3m
common stock. the gross proceeds from the offering, to be used for general
corporate purposes, were $550 million ($540 million net of issuance costs). as
discussed in note 1, 3m adopted changes to accounting for convertible debt
instruments that maybe settled in cash upon conversion (including partial
cash settlement), effective january1, 2009, with retrospective application
to all periods presented. as such, additional interest expense essentially
equivalent to the portion of issuance proceeds retroactively allocated to the
instruments equity component was recognized over the period from the
convertible notes issuance on november15, 2002 through november15,
2005 (the first date holders of these notes had the ability to put them back to
3m). debt issuance costs were amortized on a straight-line basis over a
three-year period beginning in november2002. debt issue costs allocated
to the notes equity component were not material. on february14, 2003, 3m
registered these convertible notes in a registration statement filed with the
securities and exchange commission. the terms of the convertible notes include
a yield to maturity of 0.50% and an initial conversion premium of 40 percent
over the $65.00 (split-adjusted) closing price of 3m common stock on november14,
2002. if certain conditions for conversion (relating to the closing common
stock prices of 3m exceeding the conversion trigger price for specified
periods) are met, holders may convert each of the 30-year zero-coupon senior
notes into 9.4602 shares of 3m common stock in any calendar quarter commencing
after march31, 2003. the conversion trigger price for the fourth quarter
of 2009 was $122.42 per share. if the conditions for conversion are met, and 3m
elects not to settle in cash, the 30-year zero-coupon senior notes will be
convertible in the aggregate into approximately 2.4 million shares of 3m common
stock. the conditions for conversion related to the companys convertible notes
have never been met. if the conditions for conversion are met, 3m may choose to
pay in cash and/or common stock; however, if this occurs, the company has the
intent and ability to settle this debt security in cash. accordingly, there was
no impact on 3ms diluted earnings per share.
in december2009, the
companys $350 million of dealer remarketable securities were remarketed. they
were reissued with a fixed coupon rate of5.61%. these securities, which
are classified as current portion of long-term debt, were originally issued in december2000
and have a final maturity date of december2010.

note 11. pension and
postretirement benefit plans
3m has company-sponsored retirement plans covering
substantially all u.s. employees and many employees outside the united states.
in total, 3m has over 60 plans in 24 countries. pension benefits associated
with these plans generally are based on each participants years of service,
compensation, and age at retirement or termination. in addition to providing
pension benefits, the company provides certain postretirement health care and
life insurance benefits for substantially all of its u.s. employees who reach
retirement age while employed by the company. most international employees and
retirees are covered by government health care programs. the cost of company-provided
postretirement health care plans for international employees is not material
and is combined with u.s. amounts in the tables that follow.
the
companys pension funding policy is to deposit with independent trustees
amounts allowable by law. trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are
maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their
beneficiaries. there are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its
nature. for its u.s. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit
plans, the company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit
payments with an independent trustee.
in
august2006, the pension protection act (ppa) was signed into law in the
u.s. the ppa increases the funding target for defined benefit pension plans to
100% of the target liability. the ppa transition rulesrequire a funding
liability target of 92% in 2008, reaching 100% by 2011. 3ms u.s. qualified
defined benefit plans are funded at the applicable transition funding liability
target for 2009.
during the first quarter
of 2008, the company made modifications to its u.s. postretirement benefits
plan. the changes were effective beginning january1, 2009, and allow
current retired employees and employees who retire before january1, 2013
the option to continue on the existing postretirement plans or elect the new
plans. current employees who retire after december31, 2012, will receive
a savings account benefits-based plan. as a result of the modification to the
u.s. postretirement benefits plan, the company remeasured its u.s. plans
assets and accumulated postretirement benefit obligation (apbo) as of march31,
2008. the impact of the plan modifications reduced the apbo by $148 million,
which was partially offset by asset values being $97 million lower than on december31,
2007. therefore, the accrued benefit cost liability recorded on the balance
sheet as of march31, 2008, was reduced by $51 million. the remeasurement
reduced the 2008 expense by $15 million.
in 2009, the company made
further modifications to its u.s. postretirement benefit plan. the changes are
effective beginning january1, 2010, and limit the amount of medical
inflation absorbed by the company to three percent a year. as a result, as of
the december31, 2009 measurement date, the apbo was reduced by $168
million.
during
the second quarter of 2009, the company offered a voluntary early retirement
incentive program to certain eligible participants of its u.s. pension plans
who met age and years of pension service requirements. the eligible
participants who accepted the offer and retired by june1, 2009, received
an enhanced pension benefit. pension benefits were enhanced by adding one
additional year of pension service and one additional year of age for certain benefit
calculations. approximately 700 participants accepted the offer and retired by june1,
2009. as a result, the company incurred a $21 million charge related to these
special termination benefits.
during
2009, 3m sumitomo (japan) experienced a higher number of retirements than
normal, largely due to early retirement incentive programs, which required
eligible employees who elected to leave the company to retire by september2009.
participants in the japan pension plan had the option of receiving cash lump
sum payments when exiting the plan, which a number of participants exiting the
pension plan elected to receive. in accordance with asc 715, compensation  retirement benefits, settlement accounting is
required when the lump sum distributions in a year are greater than the sum of
the annual service and interest costs. due to the large number of lump sum
payment elections in 2009 the company incurred $17 million of settlement
charges.
3m
was informed during the first quarter of 2009 that the general partners of wg
trading company, in which 3ms benefit plans hold limited partnership
interests, are the subject of a criminal investigation as well as civil
proceedings by the sec and cftc (commodity futures trading commission). as of december31,
2009 these holdings represented less than 2 percent of 3ms fair value of total
plan assets. the court appointed receiver has taken control of wg trading
company and other entities controlled by its general partners, and further
redemptions of limited partnership interests are restricted pending court
proceedings. 3m currently believes that the resolution of these events will not
have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the
company. the company has insurance that it believes, based on what is currently
known, is applicable to this potential loss.

the company determines
the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the december31
measurement date for the u.s. pension and postretirement benefit plans, which
is also the date used for the related annual measurement assumptions. the
discount rate reflects the current rate at which the associated liabilities
could be effectively settled at the end of the year. the company sets its rate
to reflect the yield of a portfolio of high quality, fixed-income debt
instruments that would produce cash flows sufficient in timing and amount to
settle projected future benefits. using this methodology, the company
determined a discount rate of 5.77% for pension and 5.62% for postretirement
benefits to be appropriate as of december31, 2009, which is a decrease of
0.37 of a percentage point and 0.52 of a percentage point, respectively, from
the rate used as of december31, 2008. for the international pension and
postretirement plans the discount rates also reflect the current rate at which
the associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year.
if the country has a deep market in corporate bonds the company matches the
expected cash flows from the plan either to a portfolio of bonds that generate
sufficient cash flow or a notional yield curve generated from available bond
information. in countries that do not have a deep market in corporate bonds,
government bonds are considered with a risk premium to approximate corporate
bond yields.
for
the u.s. qualified pension plans, the companys assumption for the expected return
on plan assets was 8.50% in 2009. projected returns are based primarily on
broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and forward-looking
estimates of active portfolio and investment management. as of december31,
2009, the companys 2010 expected long-term rate of return on u.s. plan assets
is based on an asset allocation assumption of 40% global equities, with an
expected long-term rate of return of 8.7%, 13% private equities with an
expected long-term rate of return of 12.7%; 26% fixed-income securities with an
expected long-term rate of return of 4.6%; 16% absolute return investments
independent of traditional performance benchmarks, with an expected long term
return of 6.5%; and 5% commodities with an expected long-term rate of return of
6.4%. the company expects additional positive return from active investment
management. these assumptions result in an 8.50% expected rate of return on an
annualized basis in 2010. the actual rate of return on plan assets in 2009 was
12.6%. in 2008 the plan experienced a loss of 13.6% and in 2007 earned a rate
of return in excess of 14%. the average annual actual return on the plan assets
over the past 10 and 25 years has been 5.6% and 11.2%, respectively. return on
assets assumptions for international pension and other post-retirement benefit
plans are calculated on a plan-by-plan basis using plan asset allocations and
expected long-term rate of return assumptions.
during
2009, the company made discretionary contributions totaling $710 million to its
principal u.s. qualified pension plan. of the $710 million, $600 million was
contributed in shares of the companys common stock, which is considered a
non-cash financing activity. in 2010, the company expects to contribute an
amount in the range of $500 million to $700 million to its u.s. and
international retirement plans. the company does not have a required minimum
pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2010. therefore, the
amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary significantly
depending on the u.s. plans funded status and the anticipated tax
deductibility of the contribution.
assumed health care trend rates
the company reviews
external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine
the health care trend rates for the postretirement medical plans. as of december31,
2006, the company modified its health care trend rates assumption by raising
the rate and separating the trend rates used for plan participants less than 65
years of age and plan participants 65 years of age or older. the separation of
the trend rates reflects the higher costs

associated with
prescription drugs in the 65 or older age group. the assumed health care trend

three percent; the remaining inflation will be passed on to plan participants.
since the company has limited its inflationary costs a change in medical trend
rate only impacts the amount of medicare subsidy it will receive. a one

plan asset management
3ms
investment strategy for its pension and postretirement plans is to manage the
funds on a going-concern basis. the primary goal of the funds is to meet the
obligations as required. the secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of
return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without subjecting
the company to an undue amount of contribution rate volatility. fund returns are
used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible
within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits,
thus reducing the level of contributions 3m must make. the investment strategy
has used long duration cash and derivative instruments to offset approximately
50 percent of the interest rate sensitivity of u.s. pension liabilities. in
addition, credit risk is managed through mandates for public securities and
maximum issuer limits that are established and monitored on a regular basis.
during
2009, $600 million of 3m common stock was contributed to the principal u.s.
qualified pension plan. all of the 3m shares contributed to the u.s. pension
plan were sold before year end by an independent fiduciary to the plan.
normally, 3m does not buy or sell any of its own stock as a direct investment
for its pension and other postretirement benefit funds. however, due to
external investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell
or hold 3m stock. the aggregate amount of the shares would not be considered to
be material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.

assets in terms of levels 1, 2 and 3. see note 13 for descriptions of these

u.s. pension plans assets
in order to achieve the
investment objectives in the u.s. pension plans, the investment policy includes
a target strategic asset allocation. the investment policy allows some
tolerance around the target in recognition that market fluctuations and
illiquidity of some investments may cause the allocation to a specific asset
class to stray from the target allocation, potentially for long periods of
time. acceptable ranges have been designed to allow for deviation from
long-term targets and to allow for the opportunity for tactical over- and
under-weights. the portfolio will normally be rebalanced when the quarter-end
asset allocation deviates from acceptable ranges. the allocation is reviewed
regularly by the named fiduciary of the plans.

global
equity consists primarily of publicly traded u.s. and non-u.s. equities, europe, australasia, far east (eafe)
index funds, equity private placement funds and some cash and cash equivalents.
publicly traded equities are valued at the closing price reported in the active
market in which the individual securities are traded. index funds are valued at
the net asset value (nav) as determined by the custodian of the fund. the nav
is based on the fair value of the underlying assets owned by the fund, minus
its liabilities then divided by the number of units outstanding. private
placement funds are valued using the most recent general partner statement of
fair value, updated for any subsequent partnership interests cash flows.
fixed
income consists of u.s. treasuries, preferred securities, convertible
securities, u.s. and non-u.s. corporate bonds, asset backed securities,
collateralized mortgage obligations, agencies, private placements and cash and
cash equivalents. included in fixed income are derivative investments such as
credit default swaps, interest rate swaps and futures contracts that are used
to help manage risks. u.s. government and government agency bonds and notes are
valued at the closing price reported in the active market in which the
individual security is traded. corporate and other bonds and notes are valued
at either the yields currently available on comparable securities of issuers
with similar credit ratings or valued under a discounted cash flows approach
that maximizes observable inputs, such as current yields of similar
instruments, but includes adjustments for certain risks that may not be
observable such as credit and liquidity risks. swaps and derivative instruments
are valued by the custodian using closing market swap curves and market derived
inputs.
private
equity consists of interests in partnerships that invest in u.s. and non-u.s.
debt and equity securities. the portfolio is a diversified mix of partnership
interests including buyouts, distressed debt, growth equity, mezzanine, real
estate and venture capital investments. partnership interests are valued using
the most recent general partner statement of fair value, updated for any
subsequent partnership interests cash flows.
absolute
return consists primarily of private partnership interests in hedge funds,
hedge fund of funds and bank loan funds. partnership interests are valued using
the nav as determined by the administrator or custodian of the fund. hedge fund
partnership interests, which have a redemption right and are past any lock-up
redemption period, are classified as level 2.
commodities
consist of commodity-linked notes and commodity-linked derivative contracts
designed to deliver investment returns similar to the goldman sachs commodities

international
pension plans assets
outside the u.s., pension
plan assets are typically managed by decentralized fiduciary committees. the
disclosure below of asset categories is presented in aggregate for the 55 plans
in 23 countries, however there is significant variation in policy asset
allocation from country to country. local regulations, local funding rules, and
local financial and tax considerations are part of the funding and investment
allocation process in each country. 3ms treasury group provides standard
funding and investment guidance to all international plans with more focused
guidance to the larger plans.
each plan has its own
strategic asset allocation. the asset allocations are reviewed periodically and
rebalanced when necessary.

note 12. derivatives
the
company uses interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and
forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated with foreign
exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. the information
that follows explains the various types of derivatives and financial
instruments used by 3m, how and why 3m uses such instruments, how such
instruments are accounted for, and how such instruments impact 3ms financial
position and performance.
additional information
with respect to the impacts on other comprehensive income of nonderivative
hedging and derivative instruments is included in note 6. additional information
with respect to the fair value of derivative instruments is included in note
13. references to information regarding derivatives and/or hedging instruments
associated with the companys long-term debt are also made in note 10.
types of
derivatives/hedging instruments and inclusion in income/other comprehensive
income
cash flow hedges:
for
derivative instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative is reported as a component
of other comprehensive income and reclassified into earnings in the same period
during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. gains and losses on the
derivative representing either hedge ineffectiveness or hedge components
excluded from the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in current
earnings.
cash flow
hedging - foreign currency forward and option contracts: the company enters into foreign exchange
forward and option contracts to hedge against the effect of exchange rate
fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and certain
intercompany financing transactions. these transactions are designated as cash
flow hedges. the settlement or extension of these derivatives will result in
reclassifications (from accumulated other comprehensive income) to earnings in
the period during which the hedged transactions affect earnings. generally, 3m
dedesignates these cash flow hedge relationships in advance of the occurrence
of the forecasted transaction. the portion of gains or losses on the derivative
instrument previously accumulated in other comprehensive income for
dedesignated hedges remains in accumulated other comprehensive income until the
forecasted transaction occurs. changes in the value of derivative instruments
after dedesignation are recorded in earnings and are included in the
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments section below. hedge
ineffectiveness and the amount excluded from effectiveness testing recognized
in income on cash flow hedges were not material for 2009 and 2008. the maximum
length of time over which 3m hedges its exposure to the variability in future
cash flows for a majority of the forecasted transactions is 12 months and,
accordingly, at december31, 2009, the majority of the companys open
foreign exchange forward and option contracts had maturities of one year or
less. the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the companys foreign
exchange forward and option contracts designated as cash flow hedges at december31,
2009 was approximately $2.9 billion.
cash flow hedging - commodity price management: the company manages commodity price
risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and
forward physical contracts. the company uses commodity price swaps relative to
natural gas as cash flow hedges of forecasted transactions to manage price
volatility. the related mark-to-market gain or loss on qualifying hedges is
included in other comprehensive income to the extent effective, and
reclassified into cost of sales in the period during which the hedged
transaction affects earnings. generally, the length of time over which 3m
hedges its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for its forecasted
natural gas transactions is 12 months. no significant commodity cash flow
hedges were discontinued and hedge ineffectiveness was not material for 2009
and 2008. the dollar equivalent gross notional amount of the companys natural
gas commodity price swaps designated as cash flow hedges at december31,
2009 was $30 million.
the location in the consolidated statements of income
and comprehensive income and amounts of gains and losses related to derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges are as follows. reclassifications of
amounts from accumulated other comprehensive income into income include
accumulated gains (losses) on dedesignated hedges at the time earnings are
impacted by the forecasted transaction.

as of december31,
2009, the company had a balance of $36 million associated with the after tax
net unrealized loss associated with cash flow hedging instruments recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive income. 3m expects to reclassify to earnings
over the next 12 months a majority of this balance (with the impact offset by
cash flows from underlying hedged items).
fair value hedges:
for derivative
instruments that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges, the gain or
loss on the derivatives as well as the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged
item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in current earnings.
fair
value hedging - interest rate swaps: the company manages interest expense using a mix of
fixed and floating rate debt. to help manage borrowing costs, the company may
enter into interest rate swaps. under these arrangements, the company agrees to
exchange, at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating
interest amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal
amount. the dollar equivalent (based on inception date foreign currency
exchange rates) gross notional amount of the companys interest rate swaps at december31,
2009 was $1.352 billion.
at december31,
2009, the company had interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of
underlying fixed rate obligations. in november2006, the company entered
into a $400 million fixed-to-floating interest rate swap concurrent with the
issuance of the three-year medium-term note due in 2009. the swap and the
underlying note matured in november2009. in july2007, in connection
with the issuance of a seven-year eurobond for an amount of 750 million euros,
the company completed a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on a notional
amount of 400 million euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of the fixed
interest rate eurobond obligation. in may2009, the company entered into
two fixed-to-floating interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of
$800 million designated as fair value hedges of the fixed interest rate
obligation under the existing $800 million, three-year, 4.50% notes issued in october2008.
the mark-to-market of these fair value hedges is recorded as gains or losses in
interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss on the underlying debt
instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense. these fair value hedges
are highly effective and, thus, there is no impact on earnings due to hedge
ineffectiveness.
fair value hedging  foreign
currency: in november2008,
the company entered into foreign currency forward contracts to purchase
japanese yen, pound sterling, and euros with a notional amount of $255 million
at the contract rates. these contracts were designated as fair value hedges of
a u.s. dollar tax obligation.
these fair value hedges matured in early january2009. the mark-to-market
of these forward contracts was recorded as gains or losses in tax expense and
was offset by the gain or loss on the underlying tax obligation, which also was
recorded in tax expense. the fair value of these contracts as of december31,
2008 was $25 million. changes in the value of these contracts in 2009 through
their maturity were not material.

net investment
hedges:
as circumstances warrant,
the company uses cross currency swaps, forwards and foreign currency
denominated debt to hedge portions of the companys net investments in foreign
operations. for hedges that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains
or losses attributable to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in cumulative
translation within other comprehensive income. the remainder of the change in
value of such instruments is recorded in earnings. recognition in earnings of
amounts previously recorded in cumulative translation is limited to
circumstances such as complete or substantially complete liquidation of the net
investment in the hedged foreign operation. at december31, 2009, there
were no cross currency swaps or foreign currency forward contracts designated
as net investment hedges.
in november2006,
the company entered into a three-year floating-to-floating cross currency swap
with a notional amount of $200 million. this transaction was a partial hedge of
the companys net investment in its european subsidiaries. this swap converted
u.s. dollar-based variable interest payments to euro-based variable interest
payments associated with the notional amount. this swap matured in november2009.
in september2006,
the company entered into a three-year floating-to-floating cross currency swap
with a notional amount of $300 million. this transaction was a partial hedge of
the companys net investment in its japanese subsidiaries. this swap converted
u.s. dollar-based variable interest payments to yen-based variable interest
payments associated with the notional amount. this swap matured in september2009.
in addition to the
derivative instruments used as hedging instruments in net investment hedges, 3m
also uses foreign currency denominated debt as nonderivative hedging
instruments in certain net investment hedges. in julyand december2007,
the company issued seven-year fixed rate eurobond securities for amounts of 750
million euros and 275 million euros, respectively. 3m designated each of these
eurobond issuances as hedging instruments of the companys net investment in
its european subsidiaries.
the location in the
consolidated statements of income and comprehensive income and amounts of gains
and losses related to derivative and nonderivative instruments designated as
net investment hedges are as follows. there were no reclassifications of the
effective portion of net investment hedges out of accumulated other
comprehensive income into income for the period presented in the table below.

derivatives not designated as hedging instruments:
derivatives not designated as hedging instruments include dedesignated
foreign currency forward and option contracts that formerly were designated in
cash flow hedging relationships (as referenced in the preceding cash flow
hedges section). in addition, 3m enters into foreign currency forward contracts
and commodity price swaps to offset, in part, the impacts of certain
intercompany activities (primarily associated with intercompany licensing
arrangements and certain intercompany loans) and fluctuations in costs associated
with the use of certain precious metals, respectively. these derivative
instruments are not designated in hedging relationships; therefore, fair value
gains and losses on these contracts are recorded in earnings. the dollar
equivalent gross notional amount of these forward, option and swap contracts
not designated as hedging instruments totaled $860 million as of december31,
2009. the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for
trading purposes.

effects: 3m
estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging impacts,
decreased net income attributable to 3m by approximately $220 million in 2009
and increased net income attributable to 3m by approximately $160 million in
2008 and $150 million in 2007. this estimate includes the effect of translating
profits from local currencies into u.s. dollars; the impact of currency
fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the united
states and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including derivative
instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks and the
negative impact of swapping venezuelan bolivars into u.s. dollars. 3m estimates
that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses had an
immaterial impact in 2009, and increased net income attributable to 3m by
approximately $40 million in 2008 and by approximately $10 million in 2007.
credit
risk: the company
is exposed to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in
interest rate swaps, currency swaps, commodity price swaps, and forward and
option contracts. however, the companys risk is limited to the fair value of
the instruments. the company actively monitors its exposure to credit risk
through the use of credit approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major
international banks and financial institutions as counterparties. the company
does not anticipate nonperformance by any of these counterparties. 3m has
credit support agreements in place with two of its primary derivatives
counterparties. under these agreements, either party is required to post
eligible collateral when the market value of transactions covered by these
agreements exceeds specified thresholds, thus limiting credit exposure for both
parties.

note 13. fair value measurements
as discussed in note 1,
3m adopted the new fair value measurements standard, codified in asc 820,
prospectively effective january1, 2008, with respect to fair value
measurements of (a)nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the companys financial statements on
a recurring basis (at least annually) and (b)all financial assets and liabilities.
3m adopted the remaining aspects of the fair value measurement standard
relative to nonfinancial assets and liabilities that are measured at fair
value, but are recognized and disclosed at fair value on a nonrecurring basis,
prospectively effective january1, 2009.
under the new standard,
fair value is defined as the exit price, or the amount that would be received
to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants as of the measurement date. the standard also
establishes a hierarchy for inputs used in measuring fair value that maximizes
the use of observable inputs and minimizes the use of unobservable inputs by
requiring that the most observable inputs be used when available. observable
inputs are inputs market participants would use in valuing the asset or
liability developed based on market data obtained from sources independent of
the company. unobservable inputs are inputs that reflect the companys
assumptions about the factors market participants would use in valuing the
asset or liability developed based upon the best information available in the
circumstances. the hierarchy is broken down into three levels. level 1 inputs
are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or
liabilities. level 2 inputs include quoted prices for similar assets or
liabilities in active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or
liabilities in markets that are not active, and inputs (other than quoted
prices) that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly or
indirectly. level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
categorization within the valuation hierarchy is based upon the lowest level of
input that is significant to the fair value measurement.
assets
and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis:
as described in note 1,
at 3m, effective january1, 2008, fair value measurement under asc 820
principally applied to financial asset and liabilities such as available-for-sale
marketable securities, available-for-sale investments (included as part of
investments in the consolidated balance sheet) and certain derivative
instruments. derivatives include cash flow hedges, interest rate swaps and most
net investment hedges. these items were previously and will continue to be
marked-to-market at each reporting period; however, the definition of fair
value used for these mark-to-markets is now applied using asc 820. the
information in the following paragraphs and tables primarily addresses matters
relative to these financial assets and liabilities. the information
incorporates guidance relating to determining the fair value of a financial
asset when the market for that asset is not active, which was effective for 3m
beginning with the quarter ended september30, 2008. the information also
incorporates the new guidance described in note 1 related to determining fair
values when the volume and level of activity for the asset or liability have
significantly decreased and identifying transactions that are not orderly,
which was effective for 3m beginning april1, 2009. separately, there were
no material fair value measurements with respect to nonfinancial assets or
liabilities that are recognized or disclosed at fair value in the companys
financial statements on a recurring basis subsequent to the effective date of
the new standard (as impacted by associated updates codified in asc 820).
3m uses various valuation
techniques, which are primarily based upon the market and income approaches,
with respect to financial assets and liabilities. following is a description of
the valuation methodologies used for the respective financial assets and
liabilities measured at fair value.
available-for-sale
marketable securities  except auction rate securities:
marketable securities,
except auction rate securities, are valued utilizing multiple sources. a
weighted average price is used for these securities. market prices are obtained
for these securities from a variety of industry standard data providers,
security master files from large financial institutions, and other third-party
sources. these multiple prices are used as inputs into a
distribution-curve-based algorithm to determine the daily fair value to be
used. 3m classifies treasury securities as level 1, while all other marketable
securities (excluding auction rate securities) are classified as level 2.
marketable securities are discussed further in note 9.
available-for-sale marketable securities  auction rate securities
only:
as discussed in note 9, auction rate securities held by 3m failed to
auction since the second half of 2007. as a result, investments in auction rate
securities are valued utilizing broker-dealer valuation models and third-party
indicative bid levels in markets that are not active. 3m classifies these
securities as level 3.
table of
contents
available-for-sale
investments:
investments include
equity securities that are traded in an active market. closing stock prices are
readily available from active markets and are used as being representative of
fair value. 3m classifies these securities as level 1.
derivative instruments:
the companys derivative
assets and liabilities within the scope of asc 815 are required to be recorded
at fair value. the companys derivatives that are recorded at fair value
include foreign currency forward and option contracts, commodity price swaps,
interest rate swaps, and net investment hedges where the hedging instrument is
recorded at fair value. net investment hedges that use foreign currency
denominated debt to hedge 3ms net investment are not impacted by the fair
value measurement standard under asc 820, as the debt used as the hedging
instrument is marked to a value with respect to changes in spot foreign
currency exchange rates and not with respect to other factors that may impact
fair value.
3m has determined that
foreign currency forwards and commodity price swaps will be considered level 1
measurements as these are traded in active markets which have identical asset
or liabilities, while currency swaps, foreign currency options, interest rate
swaps and cross-currency swaps will be considered level 2. for level 2
derivatives, 3m uses inputs other than quoted prices that are observable for
the asset. these inputs include foreign currency exchange rates, volatilities,
and interest rates. the level 2 derivative positions are primarily valued using
standard calculations/models that use as their basis readily observable market
parameters. industry standard data providers are 3ms primary source for
forward and spot rate information for both interest rates and currency rates,
with resulting valuations periodically validated through third-party or
counterparty quotes and a net present value stream of cash flows model.

in addition, the plan
assets of 3ms pension and postretirement benefit plans are measured at fair

assets
and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis:
disclosures for nonfinancial assets and liabilities
that are measured at fair value, but are recognized and disclosed at fair value
on a nonrecurring basis, are required prospectively beginning january1,
2009. during 2009, such measurements of fair value related primarily to the
nonfinancial assets and liabilities with respect to the business combinations
that closed in 2009 and long-lived asset impairments in 2009.
the net identifiable tangible and intangible assets
and liabilities (excluding goodwill) for business combinations that closed in
2009 (discussed in note 2) was $50 million. for business combinations, 3m uses
inputs other than quoted prices that are observable, such as interest rates,
cost of capital, and market comparable royalty rates, which are applied to
income and market valuation approaches. 3m considers these level 2 inputs.
long-lived asset impairments totaled approximately $32
million pre-tax for 2009, which included the portion of 2009 restructuring
actions related to long-lived asset impairments as discussed in note 4, with
the complete carrying amount of such assets written off and included in
operating income results. in addition to the restructuring activities, in june2009
the company recorded a $13 million impairment of certain long-lived assets
associated with the uk passport production activity of 3ms security systems
division (within the safety, security and protection services business
segment). in june2009, 3m was notified that the uk government decided to
award the production of its
table
of contents
passports to a competitor upon the expiration of 3ms
existing uk passport contracts in october2010. accordingly, 3m tested the
long lived assets associated with the uk passport activity for recoverability
which indicated that the asset groupings carrying amount exceeded the
remaining expected cash flows. as a result, associated assets were written down
to a fair value of $41 million in june2009. 3m primarily uses a
discounted cash flow model that uses inputs other than quoted prices that are
observable, such as interest rates and cost of capital, to determine the fair
value of such assets. 3m considers these level 2 inputs. refer to note 1 (property,
plant and equipment and intangible assets) for further discussion of
accounting policies related to long-lived asset impairments.

fair
value of financial instruments: at
december31, 2009 and 2008, the companys financial instruments included
cash and cash equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable,
investments, accounts payable, borrowings, and derivative contracts. the fair
values of cash and cash equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and
short-term borrowings and current portion of long-term debt (except the $350
million dealer remarketable securities prior to 2009) approximated carrying
values because of the short-term nature of these instruments.
available-for-sale marketable securities and investments, in addition to
certain derivative instruments, are recorded at fair values as indicated in the
preceding disclosures. fair values for investments held at cost are not readily
available, but are estimated to approximate fair value. the company utilized
third-party quotes to estimate fair values for its dealer remarketable
securities and long-term debt. information with respect to the carrying amounts
and estimated fair values of these financial instruments follow:

the fair values reflected

designated as fair value hedges and by the designation of 1,025 million euros
of fixed rate eurobond securities issued by the company as hedging instruments
of the companys net investment in its european subsidiaries. 3ms fixed-rate bonds are trading at a premium at december31,
2009 due to the low market interest rates and tightening of 3ms credit spreads
during 2009.

note 14. commitments and
contingencies
capital and operating leases:
rental
expense under operating leases was $244 million in 2009, $247 million in 2008
and $226 million in 2007. it is 3ms practice to secure renewal rights for
leases, thereby giving 3m the right, but not the obligation, to maintain a
presence in a leased facility. 3m has two primary capital leases. first, 3m has
a capital lease, which became effective in april2003, that involves a
building in the united kingdom (with a lease term of 22 years). during the
second quarter of 2003, 3m recorded a capital lease asset and obligation of
approximately 33.5 million united kingdom pounds (approximately $53 million at december31,
2009 exchange rates). second, during the fourth quarter of 2009, 3m recorded a
capital lease asset and obligation of approximately $50 million related to an
it investment with an amortization period of seven years.

warranties/guarantees:
3ms accrued product
warranty liabilities, recorded on the consolidated balance sheet as part of
current and long-term liabilities, are estimated at approximately $25 million
as of december31, 2009 and 2008. 3m does not consider this amount to be
material. the fair value of 3m guarantees of loans with third parties and other
guarantee arrangements, except for the guarantee discussed below, are not
material.
3m
security printing and systems limited, a subsidiary of 3m, has provided a
guarantee through 3m united kingdom holdings plc (another subsidiary of 3m) to
the identity and passport service (ips). 3m has guaranteed default on
performance and payment of liabilities under a contract with ips. the amount
guaranteed is 45 million great british pounds (approximately $71 million u.s.
dollars at december31, 2009). the contract expires on october4,
2010. 3m does not expect to pay out any funds under this guarantee.
related
party activity:
3m
does not have any related party activity that is not in the ordinary course of
business.
legal proceedings:
the company and
some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims and lawsuits,
principally in the united states, and regulatory proceedings worldwide. these
include various products liability (involving products that the company now or
formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property, and commercial claims
and lawsuits, including those brought under the antitrust laws, and
environmental proceedings. the following sections first describe the
significant legal proceedings in which the company is involved, and then
describe the liabilities and associated insurance receivables the company has
accrued relating to its significant legal proceedings. unless otherwise stated,
the company is vigorously defending all such litigation.
shareholder
derivative litigation
as previously
reported, in july2007, a shareholder derivative lawsuit was filed in the
u.s. district court for the district of delaware against the company as nominal
defendant and against each then current member of the board of directors and
the officers named in the summary compensation table of the 2007 proxy
statement. the suit alleged
table
of contents
that the companys
2007 proxy statement contained false and misleading statements concerning the
tax deductibility of compensation payable under the executive annual incentive
plan (plan) and the standards for determining the amounts payable under the
plan. the lawsuit sought a declaration voiding shareholder approval of the
plan, termination of the plan, voiding the elections of directors, equitable
accounting, and awarding costs, including attorneys fees.
in may2008,
the company and the individual defendants agreed to settle the litigation
without admitting any liability or wrongdoing of any kind. the settlement
agreement, which was subject to court approval, called for the compensation
committee of the companys board of directors to adopt a resolution formally
stating its interpretation of certain aspects of the plan, and the company to
file a current report on form8-k to the same effect, and to pay up to
$600,000 in attorneys fees to the plaintiffs counsel. on december30,
2008, the court issued an order preliminarily
approving the settlement agreement. as a result, the company notified all
stockholders of the proposed settlement and its terms and their right to object
to the terms of the settlement. on june5, 2009, the court issued an order
approving the settlement.
french competition council investigation
on december4,
2008, the companys subsidiary in france received a statement of objections
from the french competition council alleging an abuse of a dominant position
regarding the supply of retro-reflective films for vertical signing
applications in france and of participation in a concerted practice with the
major french manufacturers of vertical signs. the statement of objections is an
intermediate stage in the proceedings and no final determination regarding an
infringement of french competition ruleshas been made. 3m has filed its
response denying that the statement of objections states a valid claim against
3m. it is difficult to predict the final outcome of the investigation at this
time.
compliance matters
on november12,
2009, the company contacted the department of justice (doj) and securities and
exchange commission (sec) to voluntarily disclose that the company was
conducting an internal investigation as a result of reports it received about
its subsidiary in turkey, alleging bid rigging and bribery and other
inappropriate conduct in connection with the supply of certain reflective and
other materials and related services to turkish government entities. the
company also contacted certain affected government agencies in turkey. the
company continues to cooperate with the doj and sec in the companys ongoing
investigation of this matter. the company retained outside counsel to conduct
an assessment of its policies, practices, and controls and to evaluate its
overall compliance with the foreign corrupt practices act. the company cannot
predict at this time the outcome of its investigation or what regulatory
actions may be taken or what other consequences may result.
respirator mask/asbestos
litigation
as of december31,
2009, the company is a named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in
numerous lawsuits in various courts that purport to represent approximately 2,510
individual claimants, down from the approximately 2,700 individual claimants
with actions pending at december31, 2008.
the vast majority
of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently pending against the
company allege use of some of the companys mask and respirator products and
seek damages from the company and other defendants for alleged personal injury
from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal mine dust or other
occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or
generally in the workplace. a minority of claimants generally allege personal
injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously
manufactured by the company, which are often unspecified, as well as products
manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at company premises.
since
approximately 2006, the company has experienced a significant decline in the
number of new claims filed annually by apparently unimpaired claimants. the
company attributes this decline to several factors, including certain changes
enacted in several states in recent years of the law governing asbestos-related
claims, and the highly-publicized decision in mid-2005 of the united states
district court for the southern district of texas that identified and criticized
abuses by certain attorneys, doctors and x-ray screening companies on behalf of
primarily unimpaired claimants, many of whom were recruited by plaintiffs
lawyers through mass chest x-ray screenings. the company expects the filing of
claims by unimpaired claimants in the future to continue at much lower levels
than in the past. the company believes that due to this change in the type and
volume of incoming claims, it is likely that the number of claims alleging more
serious injuries, including mesothelioma and other malignancies, while
remaining relatively constant, will represent a greater percentage of total
claims than in the past. the company has demonstrated in past trial proceedings
that its respiratory protection products are effective as claimed when used in
the intended manner and in the intended circumstances. consequently the company
believes that claimants are unable to establish that their medical conditions,
even if significant, are attributable to the companys respiratory protection products.
nonetheless the companys litigation experience indicates that claims of
persons with malignant conditions are costlier to resolve than the claims of
unimpaired persons, and it therefore believes the average cost of resolving
pending and future claims
table
of contents
on a per-claim
basis will continue to be higher than it experienced in prior periods when the
vast majority of claims were asserted by the unimpaired.
the company tried
its ninth respirator case in the superior court of alameda county, california.
the plaintiff, who is suffering from mesothelioma as a result of his exposure
to asbestos, claimed that the companys respirators were defective and failed
to provide him with adequate protection and came with inadequate warnings. on july6,
2009, after nearly four months of trial, the judge granted the companys motion
to dismiss all claims against the company at the end of the plaintiffs case.
the trial judge dismissed the claims against the company because the plaintiff
failed to prove that a defect in the companys respirator or its warnings was a
substantial factor in causing the plaintiffs mesothelioma. the plaintiff has
filed an appeal of the trial judges decision. with this dismissal, the company
has prevailed in all nine cases taken to trial, including seven of the eight
cases tried to verdict (such trials occurred in 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004,
and 2007), and an appellate reversal in 2005 of the one jury verdict adverse to
the company.
plaintiffs have
asserted specific dollar claims for damages in approximately 32% of the 913
lawsuits that were pending against the company at the end of 2009 in all jurisdictions.
a majority of states restrict or prohibit specifying damages in tort cases such
as these, and most of the remaining jurisdictions do not require such
specification. in those cases in which plaintiffs choose to assert specific
dollar amounts in their complaints, brought in states that permit such
pleading, the amounts claimed are typically not meaningful as an indicator of
the companys potential liability. this is because (a)the amounts claimed
typically bear no relation to the extent of the plaintiffs injury, if any; (b)the
complaints nearly always assert claims against multiple defendants with the
typical complaint asserting claims against as few as a dozen different
defendants to upwards of 275 different defendants, the damages alleged are not
attributed to individual defendants, and a defendants share of liability may
turn on the law of joint and several liability, which can vary by state, and by
the amount of fault a jury allocates to each defendant if a case is ultimately
tried before a jury; (c)many cases are filed against the company even
though the plaintiffs did not use any of the companys products and,
ultimately, are withdrawn or dismissed without any payment; and (d)many
cases are brought on behalf of plaintiffs who have not suffered any medical
injury, and, ultimately, are resolved without any payment or a payment that is
a small fraction of the damages initially claimed. of the 288 pending cases in
which purported damage amounts are specified in the complaints, 144 cases involve
claims of $100,000 or less, (five (5)of which also allege punitive
damages of $20 million); 104 cases involve claims between $100,000 and $3
million (six (6)of which also allege punitive damages of $1 million,
thirty-six (36) of which also allege punitive damages of $1.5 million, and one (1)of
which also allege punitive damages of $2 million); four (4)cases involve
claims of $3 million to $7.5 million (one (1)of which also allege
punitive damages of $5 million and one (1)of which also allege punitive
damages of $25 million); six (6)cases involve claims of $7.5 million to
$10 million (two (2)of which also allege punitive damages of $5 million
and four (4)of which also allege punitive damages of $21 million);
fourteen (14) cases involve claims of $10 million (one (1)of which also
allege punitive damages of $5 million and seven (7)of which also allege
punitive damages of $10 million); eleven (11) cases involve claims of $10
million to $50 million (one (1)of which also allege punitive damages of
$5 million, one (1)of which also allege punitive damages of $15 million,
five (5)of which also allege punitive damages of $15.5 million, and one (1)of
which also allege punitive damages of $20 million); and five (5)cases
involve claims of $50 million (three (3)of which also allege punitive
damages of $50 million). some complaints allege that the compensatory and
punitive damages are at least the amounts specified. as previously stated, the
companys experience and the other reasons cited indicate that the damage
amounts specified in complaints are not a meaningful factor in any assessment
of the companys potential liability.
as previously
reported, the state of west virginia, through its attorney general, filed a
complaint in 2003 against the company and two other manufacturers of
respiratory protection products in the circuit court of lincoln county, west
virginia and amended it in 2005. the amended complaint seeks substantial, but
unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for reimbursement of the costs
allegedly incurred by the state for workers compensation and healthcare
benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and
unspecified punitive damages. this case has been inactive since the fourth
quarter of 2007.
respirator mask/asbestos
litigation  aearo technologies
on april1,
2008, a subsidiary of the company purchased the stock of aearo holding corp.,
the parent of aearo technologies (aearo). aearo manufactures and sells
various products, including personal protection equipment, such as eye, ear,
head, face, fall and certain respiratory protection products.
as of december31,
2009, aearo and/or other companies that previously owned and operated aearos
respirator business (american optical corporation, warner-lambert llc, ao corp.
and cabot corporation (cabot)) are named defendants, with multiple
co-defendants, including the company, in numerous lawsuits in various courts in
which plaintiffs allege use of mask and respirator products and seek damages
from aearo and other defendants for alleged personal injury from workplace
exposures to asbestos, silica-related, or other occupational dusts found in
products manufactured by other defendants or generally in the workplace.
table
of contents
as of december31,
2009, the company, through its aearo subsidiary, has recorded $34 million as an
estimate of the probable liabilities for product liabilities and defense costs
related to current and future aearo-related asbestos and silica-related claims.
responsibility for legal costs, as well as for settlements and judgments, is
currently shared in an informal arrangement among aearo, cabot, american
optical corporation and a subsidiary of warner lambert and their insurers (the payor
group). liability is allocated among the parties based on the number of years
each company sold respiratory products under the ao safety brand and/or owned
the ao safety division of american optical corporation and the alleged years of
exposure of the individual plaintiff. aearos share of the contingent liability
is further limited by an agreement entered into between aearo and cabot on july11,
1995. this agreement provides that, so long as aearo pays to cabot an annual
fee of $400,000, cabot will retain responsibility and liability for, and
indemnify aearo against, asbestos and silica-related product liability claims
for respirators manufactured prior to july11, 1995. because the date of
manufacture for a particular respirator allegedly used in the past is often
difficult to determine, aearo and cabot have applied the agreement to claims
arising out of the alleged use of respirators while exposed to asbestos or
silica or products containing asbestos or silica prior to january1, 1997.
with these arrangements in place, aearos potential liability is limited to
exposures alleged to have arisen from the use of respirators while exposed to
asbestos, silica or other occupational dusts on or after january1, 1997.
to date, aearo has
elected to pay the annual fee. aearo could potentially be exposed to additional
claims for some part of the pre-july11, 1995 period covered by its
agreement with cabot if aearo elects to discontinue its participation in this
arrangement, or if cabot is no longer able to meet its obligations in these
matters.
developments may
occur that could affect the estimate of aearos liabilities. these developments
include, but are not limited to: (i)significant changes in the number of
future claims, (ii)significant changes in the average cost of resolving
claims, (iii)significant changes in the legal costs of defending these
claims, (iv)significant changes in the mix and nature of claims received,
(v)trial and appellate outcomes, (vi)significant changes in the law
and procedure applicable to these claims, (vii)significant changes in the
liability allocation among the co-defendants, (viii)the financial
viability of members of the payor group including exhaustion of available
coverage limits, (ix)the outcome of pending insurance coverage litigation
among certain other members of the payor group and their respective insurers,
and/or (x)a determination that the interpretation of the contractual
obligations on which aearo has estimated its share of liability is inaccurate.
the company cannot determine the impact of these potential developments on its
current estimate of aearos share of liability for these existing and future
claims. if any of the developments described above were to occur, the actual
amount of these liabilities for existing and future claims could be
significantly larger than the reserved amount.

the company filed a purported class action in the district court of ramsey
county, minnesota, seeking to represent a class of all current and certain
former salaried employees employed by the company in minnesota below a certain
salary grade who were age 46 or older at any time during the applicable period
to be determined by the court (the whitaker lawsuit). the complaint alleges
the plaintiffs suffered various forms of employment discrimination on the basis
of age in violation of the minnesota human rights act and seeks injunctive
relief, unspecified compensatory damages (which they seek to treble under the
statute), including back and front pay, punitive damages (limited by statute to
$8,500 per claimant) and attorneys fees. in january2006, the plaintiffs
filed a motion to join four additional named plaintiffs. this motion was
unopposed by the company and the four plaintiffs were joined in the case,
although one claim has been dismissed following an individual settlement. the
class certification hearing was held in december2007. on april11,
2008, the court granted the plaintiffs motion to certify the case as a class
action and defined the class as all persons who were 46 or older when employed
by 3m in minnesota in a salaried exempt position below a certain salary grade
at any time on or after may10, 2003, and who did not sign a document on
their last day of employment purporting to release claims arising out of their
employment with 3m. on june25, 2008, the minnesota court of appeals
granted the companys petition for interlocutory review of the district courts
decision granting class certification in the case. on april28, 2009, the
court of appeals issued its decision, reversing the district courts class
certification decision. the court of appeals found that the district court had
not required plaintiffs to meet the proper legal standards for certification of
a class under minnesota law and had deferred resolving certain factual disputes
that were relevant to the class certification requirements. the court of
appeals remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings in line
with the evidentiary standards defined in its opinion. the company believes
that the court of appeals correctly determined the proper legal standards to
apply to motions to certify a class action, but the company also believes that
plaintiffs motion for class certification in this case should be denied as a
matter of law. accordingly, on may28, 2009, the company filed in the
minnesota supreme court a petition for partial review of the decision of the
court of appeals. on july22, 2009, the minnesota supreme court denied the
petition. the trial court has scheduled a hearing on may5 and 6, 2010 to
take testimony on the class certification issue.
garcia
lawsuit: the
company was served on may7, 2009 with a purported class action/collective
action age discrimination lawsuit, which was filed in united states district
court for the northern district of california, san jose
table

division (the garcia lawsuit). five former and one current employee of
the company are seeking to represent all current and former salaried employees
employed by the company in the united states during the liability period, which
plaintiffs define as 2001 to the present. in addition to the six named
plaintiffs, 91 other current or former employees have signed opt-in forms,
seeking to join the action. the garcia lawsuit
expressly excludes those persons encompassed within the proposed class in the whitaker lawsuit. the same counsel, joined by additional
california counsel for the garcia lawsuit,
represents the plaintiffs in both cases.
the allegations of
the complaint in the garcia lawsuit are similar to those in the whitaker lawsuit. plaintiffs claim that they and other
similarly situated employees suffered various forms of employment
discrimination on the basis of age in violation of the federal age
discrimination in employment act. in regard to these claims, plaintiffs seek to
represent all persons who were 46 or older when employed by 3m in the united
states in a salaried position below the level of director, or salary grade 18, during
the liability period. because federal
law protects persons age 40 and older from age discrimination, with respect to
their claim of disparate impact only, plaintiffs also propose an alternative
definition of similarly situated persons that would begin at age 40. on behalf
of this group, plaintiffs seek injunctive relief, unspecified compensatory
damages including back and front pay, benefits, liquidated damages and
attorneys fees.
certain of the
plaintiffs and putative class members employment terminated under
circumstances in which they were eligible for group severance plan benefits and
in connection with those plans they signed waivers of claims, including age
discrimination claims. plaintiffs claim the waivers of age discrimination
claims were invalid in various respects. this subset of release-signing
plaintiffs seeks a declaration that the waivers of age discrimination claims
are invalid, other injunctive, but non-monetary, remedies, and attorneys fees.
on july2, 2009, the company filed its answer to the garcia lawsuit
complaint and filed a motion, which was granted, to transfer the venue of the
lawsuit to the united states district court for the district of minnesota.
eeoc
age-discrimination charges: six former employees and one current employee, all
but one of whom are plaintiffs in the garcia lawsuit,
have also filed age discrimination charges against the company with the u.s.
equal employment opportunity commission and various pertinent state agencies.
of these, three former employees filed charges in 2005 in minnesota, texas, and
california. these filings include allegations that the release of claims signed
by certain former employees in the purported class defined in the charges is
invalid for various reasons and assert age discrimination claims on behalf of
certain current and former salaried employees in states other than minnesota
and new jersey. in 2006, a current employee filed an age discrimination charge
against the company with the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission and
the pertinent state agency in missouri, asserting claims on behalf of a class
of all current and certain former salaried employees who worked in missouri and
other states other than minnesota and new jersey. in 2007, a former employee
filed an age discrimination charge against the company with the u.s. equal
employment opportunity commission and the pertinent state agency in california,
asserting claims on behalf of a class of all current and certain former
salaried employees who worked in california. in january2009, two former
employees filed age discrimination charges against the company with the u.s.
equal employment opportunity commission and the pertinent state agency in
minnesota. the filings include allegations that the release of claims signed by
certain former employees in the purported class defined in the charges is
invalid for various reasons and assert age discrimination claims on behalf of
certain current and former salaried employees in states other than minnesota.
the same law firm represents the plaintiffs in the whitaker
lawsuit as well as the claimants in each of these eeoc proceedings.
environmental matters and
litigation
the companys
operations are subject to environmental laws and regulations including those
pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges, toxic substances, and the
handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes enforceable by national,
state, and local authorities around the world, and private parties in the
united states and abroad. these laws and regulations provide, under certain
circumstances, a basis for the remediation of contamination and for personal
injury and property damage claims. the company has incurred, and will continue
to incur, costs and capital expenditures in complying with these laws and
regulations, defending personal injury and property damage claims, and
modifying its business operations in light of its environmental
responsibilities. in its effort to satisfy its environmental responsibilities
and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the company has
established, and periodically updates, policies relating to environmental
standards of performance for its operations worldwide.
remediation: under certain environmental laws,
including the united states comprehensive environmental response, compensation
and liability act of 1980 and similar state laws, the company may be jointly
and severally liable, typically with other companies, for the costs of
environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site
locations. the company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in
the united states, at which it may have some liability. please refer to the environmental
remediation liabilities in the table in the following section, accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal
proceedings, for information on the amount of the reserve.
regulatory
activities: as
previously reported, the company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing
reviews by local, state, national (primarily the u.s. environmental protection
agency (epa)), and international agencies of possible environmental and health
effects of various perfluorinated compounds (pfcs), including
perfluorooctanyl compounds
table
of contents
(perflurooctanoic
acid or pfoa and perfluorooctane sulfonate or pfos). as a result of its
phase-out decision in may2000, the company no longer manufactures
perfluorooctanyl compounds, and has agreed to a product stewardship initiative
with the epa to end its use of pfoa by 2015.
regulatory activities
concerning pfoa and/or pfos continue in europe and elsewhere, and before
certain international bodies. these activities include gathering of exposure
and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory
approaches.
in late 2008 and early
2009, the epa implemented testing of private wells and soils at certain
agricultural sites in alabama where wastewater treatment sludge was applied
from a local wastewater treatment plant that received wastewater from numerous
industrial sources. the epa also tested public drinking water in lawrence and
morgan counties and concluded that the levels of pfoa and pfos are lower than
0.04 part per billion (ppb). the epa currently believes that these levels are
not of concern and is working with local industry, including 3m, to continue
testing municipal and private wells in the area. 3m and other companies are
jointly conducting a survey of properties near the sites where wastewater
treatment sludge was applied to determine if any further private drinking water
wells are present. where such wells are determined to be present, pfoa and pfos
levels will be assessed. the epa also issued provisional health advisory values
(above which action should be taken to reduce exposure to these compounds in
drinking water) for pfoa of 0.4 ppb and pfos of 0.2 ppb.
as previously
reported, the minnesota department of health (mdh) detected low levels of
another perfluorinated compound called perfluorobutanoic acid (pfba) in
municipal wells (and in private wells as announced by the mdh in june2007)
in six nearby communities (woodbury, cottage grove, newport, st. paul park,
south st. paul, and hastings, all communities located southeast of st. paul),
some of which slightly exceeded the mdhs interim advisory level for pfba of 1
ppb. in february2008, the mdh established a health-based value (hbv) for
pfba of 7 ppb based on a clearer understanding of pfba through the results of
three major studies. an hbv is the amount of a chemical in drinking water
considered by the mdh staff to be safe for people to drink for a lifetime. as a
result of this new hbv for pfba, well advisories will no longer be required for
certain wells in the minnesota communities of lake elmo, oakdale and cottage
grove. residents in the affected communities where the levels of pfba in
private wells exceed the hbv either have been provided water treatment systems
or connected to a city water system. as part of legislation passed during the
2007 minnesota legislative session directing the mdh to develop and implement a
statewide environmental health tracking and biomonitoring program, the mdh
announced in july2008 that it will measure the amount of pfcs in the
blood of 200 adults who live in the minnesota communities of oakdale, lake elmo
and cottage grove. in july2009, the mdh reported that the levels of three
pfcs in the blood of residents in these communities who participated in the
study were slightly higher than the national average. a large body of research,
including laboratory studies and epidemiology studies of exposed employees,
shows that no human health effects are caused by pfcs at current levels of
exposure. this research has been published in peer-reviewed scientific journals
and shared with the epa and global scientific-community.
the company
continues to work with the minnesota pollution control agency (mpca) pursuant
to the terms of the previously disclosed may2007 settlement agreement and
consent order to address the presence of perfluorinated compounds in the soil
and groundwater at former disposal sites in washington county minnesota and at
the companys manufacturing facility at cottage grove minnesota. under this
agreement, the companys principal obligations include (i)evaluation of
releases of perfluoronated compounds from these sites and propose response
actions; (ii)providing alternative drinking water if and when an hbv or
health risk limit (hrl) (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water
determined by the mdh to be safe for people to drink for a lifetime) is
exceeded for any perfluoronated compounds as a result of contamination from
these sites; (iii)remediation of any source of other pfcs at these sites
that is not controlled by actions to remediate pfoa and pfos; and (iv)sharing
information with the mpca about perfluoronated compounds. during 2008, the mpca
issued formal decisions adopting remedial options for the former disposal sites
in washington county minnesota (oakdale and woodbury). in august2009, the
mpca issued a formal decision adopting remedial options for the companys
cottage grove manufacturing facility. at each location the remedial options
were among those recommended by the company.
as previously
reported, the company entered into a voluntary remedial action agreement with
the alabama department of environmental management (adem) to address the
presence of pfcs in the soil on the companys manufacturing facility in
decatur, alabama. for approximately twenty years, the company incorporated
wastewater treatment plant sludge containing pfcs in fields surrounding its
decatur facility pursuant to a permit issued by adem. after a review of the
available options to address the presence of pfcs in the soil, adem agreed that
the preferred remediation option is to use a multilayer cap over the former
sludge incorporation areas on the manufacturing site with groundwater migration
controls and treatment.
please refer to

proceedings for information on the balance of the reserve

elmo, minnesota,
as well as presence in the soil and groundwater at the companys manufacturing
facilities in decatur, alabama, and cottage grove, minnesota, and at two former
disposal sites in minnesota.
the company cannot
predict what regulatory actions arising from the foregoing proceedings and
activities, if any, may be taken regarding such compounds or the consequences
of any such actions.
litigation: as previously reported, a former
employee filed a purported class action lawsuit in 2002 in the circuit court of
morgan county, alabama, involving perfluorooctanyl chemistry, alleging that the
plaintiffs suffered fear, increased risk, subclinical injuries, and property
damage from exposure to perfluorooctanyl chemistry at or near the companys
decatur, alabama, manufacturing facility. the circuit court in 2005 granted the
companys motion to dismiss the named plaintiffs personal injury-related
claims on the basis that such claims are barred by the exclusivity provisions
of the states workers compensation act. the plaintiffs counsel filed an
amended complaint in november2006, limiting the case to property damage
claims on behalf of a purported class of residents and property owners in the
vicinity of the decatur plant. also in 2005, the judge in a second purported
class action lawsuit (filed by three residents of morgan county, alabama,
seeking unstated compensatory and punitive damages involving alleged damage to
their property from emissions of perfluorooctanyl compounds from the companys
decatur, alabama, manufacturing facility that formerly manufactured those
compounds) granted the companys motion to abate the case, effectively putting
the case on hold pending the resolution of class certification issues in the
action described above filed in the same court in 2002. despite the stay,
plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking damages for alleged personal
injuries and property damage on behalf of the named plaintiffs and the members
of a purported class. no further action in the case is expected unless and
until the stay is lifted.
in february2009,
a resident of franklin county, alabama, filed a purported class action lawsuit
in the circuit court of franklin county seeking compensatory damages and
injunctive relief based on the application by the decatur wastewater treatment
plant of wastewater treatment sludge to farmland and grasslands in the state
that allegedly contain pfoa, pfos and other perfluorochemicals. the named
defendants in the case include 3m, dyneon llc, daikin america,inc.,
synagro-wwt,inc., synagro south, llc and biological processors of
america. the named plaintiff seeks to represent a class of all persons within
the state of alabama,inc. who, within the past six years, have had pfoa,
pfos and other perfluorochemicals released or deposited on their property.
as previously
reported, two residents of washington county, minnesota, filed in october2004
a purported class action in the district court of washington county on behalf
of washington county residents who have allegedly suffered personal injuries
and property damage from alleged emissions from the former perfluorooctanyl
production facility at cottage grove, minnesota, and from historic waste
disposal sites in the vicinity of that facility. after the district court
granted the companys motion to dismiss the claims for medical monitoring and
public nuisance in april2005, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint
adding additional allegations involving other perfluorinated compounds
manufactured by the company, alleging additional legal theories in support of
their claims, adding four plaintiffs, and seeking relief based on alleged
contamination of the city of oakdale municipal water supply and certain private
wells in the vicinity of lake elmo, minnesota. in april2006, the
plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint adding two additional plaintiffs.
the two original plaintiffs thereafter dismissed their claims against the
company. on june19, 2007 the court denied the plaintiffs motion to
certify the litigation as a class action. thereafter, two of the remaining
named plaintiffs voluntarily dismissed their claims. in december2008 and january2009
the court granted the companys summary judgment motions dismissing all of the
plaintiffs claims under the minnesota environmental response and liability act
and all claims for personal injury and emotional distress, but allowed the
plaintiffs to add a claim for punitive damages with respect to their property
damage claims. in march2009, the court granted the companys summary
judgment motions seeking dismissal of the plaintiffs private nuisance and
trespass to blood claims, but denied the companys summary judgment motion with
respect to the plaintiffs negligence and trespass to soil and water claims,
and denied the companys motion to dismiss the plaintiffs claim for punitive
damages. subsequent rulings by the court in april2009 limited the
plaintiffs to property damage claims based on negligence and trespass, and
punitive damages if plaintiffs proved their trespass claim. on june17,
2009, after six weeks of trial, a washington county jury returned a unanimous
verdict in favor of the company on all remaining issues in the lawsuit. the
jury decided that the company was not negligent and had not committed a
trespass, and that plaintiffs had not suffered damage to their properties. the
court entered judgment on august13, 2009 dismissing all of the plaintiffs
claims based on the unanimous jury verdict in favor of the company.
in july2009,
the emerald coast utilities authority in florida filed a lawsuit against the
company, e.i. dupont de nemours and company, solutia,inc., and fire ram
international,inc. in the escambia county circuit court alleging
contamination of public drinking water wells from pfoa and pfos and seeking to
recover costs related to investigation, treatment, remediation and monitoring
of alleged pfoa and pfos contamination of its wells. the company, joined by the
other defendants, removed the lawsuit to the u. s. district court for the
northern district of florida. on november19, 2009 the district court
denied the plaintiffs motion to remand the case to state court, finding that
plaintiffs joinder of the only florida defendant, fire ram international,inc.,
was fraudulent. the district court subsequently denied the plaintiffs motion
for leave to file an amended complaint on grounds of timeliness.
table

in june2009,
the company, along with more than 250 other companies, was served with a
third-party complaint seeking contribution towards the cost of cleaning up a
17-mile stretch of the passaic river in new jersey. after commencing an
enforcement action in 1990, the state of new jersey filed suit against maxus
energy, tierra solutions, occidental chemical and two other companies seeking
cleanup and removal costs and other damages associated with the presence of dioxin
and other hazardous substances in the sediment of the passaic. the third-party
complaint seeks to spread those costs among the third-party defendants,
including the company. based on the cleanup remedy currently proposed by the
epa, the total costs at issue could easily exceed $1 billion. the companys
recent involvement in the case appears to relate to its past disposal of
industrial waste at two commercial waste disposal facilities in new jersey.
whether, and to what extent, the company may be required to contribute to the
costs at issue in the case remains to be determined. the company does not yet
have a basis for estimating its potential exposure in this case, although the
company currently believes its allocable share, if any, of the total costs is likely
to be a fraction of one percent.
accrued
liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings
the company
complies with the requirements of asc 450, contingencies,
and related guidance, and records liabilities for legal proceedings in those
instances where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where
liability is probable. where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a
range, the company records the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end
of the range if there is no one best estimate. the company either discloses the
amount of a possible loss or range of loss in excess of established reserves if
estimable, or states that such an estimate cannot be made. for those insured
matters where the company has taken a reserve, the company also records
receivables for the amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the
companys insurance program. for those insured matters where the company has
not taken a reserve because the liability is not probable or the amount of the
liability is not estimable, or both, but where the company has incurred an
expense in defending itself, the company records receivables for the amount of
insurance that it expects to recover for the expense incurred. the company
discloses significant legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or
the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, if the company believes
there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.
because litigation
is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable rulings or developments
could occur, there can be no certainty that the company may not ultimately
incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. a future adverse
ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in future charges
that could have a material adverse effect on the companys results of
operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded. the company
currently believes that such future charges, if any, would not have a material
adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the company, taking
into account its significant available insurance coverage. based on experience
and developments, the company periodically reexamines its estimates of probable
liabilities and associated expenses and receivables, and whether it is able to
estimate a liability previously determined to be not estimable and/or not
probable. where appropriate, the company makes additions to or adjustments of
its estimated liabilities. as a result, the current estimates of the potential
impact on the companys consolidated financial position, results of operations
and cash flows for the legal proceedings and claims pending against the company
could change in the future.
the company
estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its numerous policies,
including their exclusions, pertinent case law interpreting comparable
policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the nature of
the claim, and records an amount it has concluded is likely to be recovered.
the following table shows
the major categories of on-going litigation, environmental remediation and
other environmental liabilities for which the company has been able to estimate
its probable liability and for which the company has taken reserves and the
related insurance receivables:
at december31 (millions)
respirator
mask/asbestos liabilities (includes aearo in december31, 2009 and 2008
balances)
respirator
mask/asbestos insurance receivables
environmental
remediation liabilities
environmental
remediation insurance receivables
other
environmental liabilities
for those
significant pending legal proceedings that do not appear in the table and that
are not the subject of pending settlement agreements, the company has
determined that liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not
estimable, or both, and the company is unable to estimate the possible loss or
range of loss at this time. the
table
of contents
company does not
believe that there is any single best estimate of the respirator/mask/asbestos
liability, the environmental remediation or the other environmental liabilities
shown above, nor that it can reliably estimate the amount or range of amounts
by which those liabilities may exceed the reserves the company has established.
respirator
mask/asbestos liabilities and insurance receivables: the company estimates its respirator
mask/asbestos liabilities, including the cost to resolve the claim and defense
costs, by examining: (i)the companys experience in resolving claims, (ii)apparent
trends, (iii)the apparent quality of claims (e.g.,
whether the claim has been asserted on behalf of asymptomatic claimants), (iv)changes
in the nature and mix of claims (e.g., the
proportion of claims asserting usage of the companys mask or respirator
products and alleging exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other
occupational dusts, and claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products
allegedly manufactured by the company), (v)the number of current claims
and a projection of the number of future asbestos and other claims that may be
filed against the company, (vi)the cost to resolve recently settled
claims, and (vii)an estimate of the cost to resolve and defend against
current and future claims. because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the
number of claims that have not yet been asserted, particularly with respect to
the companys respiratory products that themselves did not contain any harmful
materials (which makes the various published studies that purport to project
future asbestos claims substantially removed from the companys principal
experience and which themselves vary widely), the company does not believe that
there is any single best estimate of this liability, nor that it can reliably
estimate the amount or range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the
reserve the company has established. no liability has been recorded regarding
the pending action brought by the west virginia attorney general previously
described.
developments may occur
that could affect the companys estimate of its liabilities. these developments
include, but are not limited to, significant changes in (i)the number of
future claims, (ii)the average cost of resolving claims, (iii)the
legal costs of defending these claims and in maintaining trial readiness, (iv)changes
in the mix and nature of claims received, (v)trial and appellate
outcomes, (vi)changes in the law and procedure applicable to these
claims, and (vii)the financial viability of other co-defendants and
insurers.
as a result of the costs
of aggressively defending itself and the greater cost of resolving claims of
persons with malignant conditions, the company increased its reserves in 2009
for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities by $33 million. as of december31,
2009, the company had reserves for respirator mask/asbestos liabilities of $104
million (excluding aearo reserves).
as of december31,
2009, the companys receivable for insurance recoveries related to the
respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $143 million. the company increased its
receivables for insurance recoveries by $7 million in 2009 related to this
litigation. as a result of settlements reached with its insurers, the company
was paid approximately $57 million in 2009 and has an agreement in principle to
receive an additional $28 million in connection with the respirator
mask/asbestos litigation.
various factors
could affect the timing and amount of recovery of this receivable, including (i)delays
in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii)the extent to which insurers
may become insolvent in the future, and (iii)the outcome of negotiations
with insurers and legal proceedings with respect to respirator mask/asbestos
liability insurance coverage. the difference between the accrued liability and
insurance receivable represents in part the time delay between payment of
claims on the one hand and receipt of insurance reimbursements on the other
hand. because of the lag time between settlement and payment of a claim, no
meaningful conclusions may be drawn from quarterly or annual changes in the
amount of receivables for expected insurance recoveries or changes in the
number of claimants.
on january5,
2007 the company was served with a declaratory judgment action filed on behalf
of two of its insurers (continental casualty and continental insurance co.
both part of the continental casualty group) disclaiming coverage for
respirator mask/asbestos claims. these insurers represent approximately $14
million of the $143 million insurance recovery receivable referenced in the
above table. the action seeks declaratory judgment regarding the allocation of
covered costs among the policies issued by the various insurers. it was filed
in hennepin county, minnesota and named, in addition to the company, over 60 of
the companys insurers. this action is similar in nature to an action filed in
1994 with respect to breast implant coverage, which ultimately resulted in the
minnesota supreme courts ruling of 2003 that was largely in the companys favor.
at the companys request, the case was transferred to ramsey county, over the
objections of the insurers. the minnesota supreme court heard oral argument of
the insurers appeal of that decision in march2008 and ruled in may2008
that the proper venue of that case is ramsey county. the case has been assigned
to a judge in ramsey county district court. the plaintiff insurers have served
an amended complaint that names some additional insurers and deletes others.
several of the insurer defendants named in the amended complaint have been
dismissed because of settlements they have reached with 3m regarding the
matters at issue in the lawsuit. the case remains in its early stages with a
trial scheduled to begin in june, 2012.

environmental
and other liabilities and insurance receivables: as of december31, 2009, the company
had recorded liabilities of $31 million for estimated environmental remediation
costs based upon an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to
each individual site and also recorded related insurance receivables of $15
million. the company records liabilities for remediation costs on an
undiscounted basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally
no later than the completion of feasibility studies or the companys commitment
to a plan of action. liabilities for estimated costs of environmental
remediation, depending on the site, are based primarily upon internal or
third-party environmental studies, and estimates as to the number,
participation level and financial viability of any other potentially responsible
parties, the extent of the contamination and the nature of required remedial
actions. the company adjusts recorded liabilities as further information
develops or circumstances change. the company expects that it will pay the
amounts recorded over the periods of remediation for the applicable sites,
currently ranging up to 30 years.
as of december31,
2009, the company had recorded liabilities of $117 million for estimated other
environmental liabilities based upon an evaluation of currently available facts
for addressing trace amounts of perfluorinated compounds in drinking water
sources in the city of oakdale and lake elmo, minnesota, as well as presence in
the soil and groundwater at the companys manufacturing facilities in decatur,
alabama, and cottage grove, minnesota, and at two former disposal sites in minnesota.
the company expects that most of the spending will occur over the next seven
years.
it is difficult to
estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation given the
uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of applicable environmental
laws and regulations, the extent of environmental contamination and the
existence of alternate cleanup methods. developments may occur that could
affect the companys current assessment, including, but not limited to: (i)changes
in the information available regarding the environmental impact of the companys
operations and products; (ii)changes in environmental regulations,
changes in permissible levels of specific compounds in drinking water sources,
or changes in enforcement theories and policies, including efforts to recover
natural resource damages; (iii)new and evolving analytical and
remediation techniques; (iv)success in allocating liability to other
potentially responsible parties; and (v)the financial viability of other
potentially responsible parties and third-party indemnitors.

note 15. employee savings and stock
ownership plans
the
company sponsors employee savings plans under section401(k)of the
internal revenue code. these plans are offered to substantially all regular
u.s. employees. during 2008 the board of directors approved various changes to
the employee savings plans. for employees hired prior to january1, 2009,
employee 401(k)contributions of up to 6% of eligible compensation are
matched in company stock at rates of 60% or 75%, depending on the plan the
employee participated in. employees hired on or after january1, 2009
receive a cash match of 100% for employee 401(k)contributions of up to 6%
of eligible compensation and also receive an employer retirement income account
cash contribution of 3% of the participants total eligible compensation. all
employee contributions are invested in a number of investment funds pursuant to
their elections. vested employees may diversify their 3m shares into other
investment options. effective january1, 2010, the matching contributions
for all participants will be made in cash.
the
company maintained an employee stock ownership plan (esop) that was established
in 1989 as a cost-effective way of funding the majority of the companys
contributions under 401(k)employee savings plans. total esop shares were
considered to be shares outstanding for earnings per share calculations. the
esop debt obligation matured in 2009 (note 10).
dividends on shares held by the esop were paid to the esop
trust and, together with company contributions, were used by the esop to repay
principal and interest on the outstanding esop debt. the tax benefit related to
dividends paid on unallocated shares was charged directly to equity and totaled
approximately $1 million in 2009, $2 million in 2008, and $3million in
2007. over the life of the esop debt, shares were released for allocation to
participants based on the ratio of the current years debt service to the
remaining debt service prior to the current payment.
until
2009, the esop was the primary funding source for the companys employee
savings plans. as permitted by accounting standards relating to employers
accounting for employee stock ownership plans, the debt of the esop was
recorded as debt, and shares pledged as collateral were reported as unearned
compensation in the consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of
changes in equity. unearned compensation was reduced symmetrically as the esop
made principal payments on the debt. expenses related to the esop included
total debt service on the notes, less dividends. the company contributed
treasury shares (accounted for at fair value) and cash (in 2009) to employee
savings plans to cover obligations not funded by the esop (reported as an
employee benefit expense).

note 16. stock-based compensation
in
may2008, shareholders approved 35 million shares for issuance under the 3m
2008 long-term incentive plan, which replaced and succeeded the 2005
management stock ownership program (msop), the 3m performance unit plan, and
the 1992 directors stock ownership program. shares under this plan may be
issued in the form of incentive stock options, nonqualified stock options,
progressive stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock,
restricted stock units, other stock awards, and performance units and
performance shares. awards denominated in shares of common stock other than
options and stock appreciation rights, per the 2008 plan, will be counted
against the 35 million share limit as 3.38 shares for every one share covered
by such award. the remaining total shares available for grant under the 3m 2008
long term incentive plan are 15,507,162 as of december31, 2009.
in 2009, the company changed
the timing of its annual stock option and restricted stock unit grant dates
from mayto february, in order to provide a stronger and more immediate
link between the performance of individuals during the preceding year and the
size of their annual stock option grants. in 2008 and prior, the company issued
options to eligible employees annually in mayusing the closing stock
price on the grant date, which was the date of the annual stockholders
meeting. accounting rulesrequire recognition of expense under a
non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense
recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. 3m employees in the united
states are eligible to retire at age 55 and after having completed five years
of service. approximately 25 percent of the stock-based compensation award
expense dollars are for this retiree-eligible population. therefore, in 2009
the retiree-eligible impact shifted stock-based compensation expense to the
first quarter, whereas in 2008 and prior this impact was recognized in the
second quarter (because of the maygrant date).
in
addition to these annual grants, the company makes other minor grants of stock
options, restricted stock units and other stock-based grants. the company
issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation rights in
certain countries. these grants do not result in the issuance of common stock
and are considered immaterial by the company. there were approximately 14,008
participants with outstanding options, restricted stock, or restricted stock
units at december31, 2009.
effective
with the may2005 msop annual grant, the company changed its vesting
period from one to three years with the expiration date remaining at 10 years
from date of grant. beginning in 2007, the company reduced the number of
traditional stock options granted under the msop plan by reducing the number of
employees eligible to receive annual grants and by shifting a portion of the
annual grant away from traditional stock options primarily to restricted stock
units. however, associated with the reduction in the number of eligible
employees, the company provided a one-time buyout grant of restricted stock
units to the impacted employees, which resulted in increased stock-based
compensation expense in 2007. the income tax benefits shown in the following
table can fluctuate by period due to the amount of incentive stock options
(isos) exercised since the company receives the isos tax benefit upon exercise.
the company last granted isos in 2002. amounts recognized in the financial
statements with respect to stock-based compensation programs, which include
stock options, restricted stock, restricted stock units and the general
employees stock purchase plan (gespp), are as follows:

outstanding
shares under option include grants from previous plans. for options outstanding
at december31, 2009, the weighted-average remaining contractual life was
58 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $844 million. for options
exercisable at december31, 2009, the weighted-average remaining
contractual life was 50 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $636
million. as of december31, 2009, there was $68 million of compensation
expense that has yet to be recognized related to non-vested stock option-based
awards. this expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting
period with a weighted-average life of 1.7 years.
the
total intrinsic values of stock options exercised during 2009, 2008 and 2007,
respectively, was $108 million, $107 million and $373 million. cash received
from options exercised during 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, was $345
million, $188 million and $692 million. the companys actual tax benefits
realized for the tax deductions related to the exercise of employee stock
options for 2009, 2008 and 2007, respectively, was $38 million, $34 million and
$122 million. capitalized stock-based compensation amounts were not material
for the twelve months ended 2009, 2008, and 2007.
the
company does not have a specific policy to repurchase common shares to mitigate
the dilutive impact of options; however, the company has historically made
adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash availability, market trends and
other factors, to satisfy stock option exercise activity.
for
annual and progressive (reload) options, the weighted average fair value at the
date of grant was calculated using the black-scholes option-pricing model and

expected
volatility is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is
expected to fluctuate during a period. for the 2009, 2008 and 2007 annual grant
date, the company estimated the expected volatility based upon the average of
the most recent one year volatility, the median of the term of the expected
life rolling volatility, the median of the most recent term of the expected
life volatility of 3m stock, and the implied volatility on the grant date. the
expected term assumption is based on the weighted average of historical grants.

as
previously mentioned, beginning in 2007, the company expanded its utilization
of restricted stock units. restricted stock unit grants generally vest at the
end of three years. the one-time buyout restricted stock unit grant in 2007
vests at the end of five years. restricted stock unit grants issued in 2008 and
prior did not accrue dividends during the vesting period. substantially all
restricted stock unit grants made after 2008 accrue dividends during the
vesting period, which will be paid out in cash at the vest date on all vested
restricted stock units. the following table summarizes restricted stock and

note 17. business segments
effective in the first
quarter of 2009, 3m made certain changes to its business segments in its
continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets and
customers. the most significant of these changes are summarized as follows:
certain 3m window films, such as 3m scotchtint
window film for buildings and 3m ultra safety and security window film for
property and personal protection during destructive weather conditions, were
previously part of the building and commercial services division within the
safety, security and protection services business segment. these window films
were transferred to the newly created renewable energy division, which is part
of the industrial and transportation business segment. the renewable energy
division consists of current 3m solar energy creation and management products
and solutions, as well as products focused on the renewable energy markets.
renewable energys portfolio includes various 3m products for solar energy
production and solar energy management (such as window films) and also includes
responsibility for wind, geothermal and biofuel-oriented products. the
preceding product moves resulted in an increase in net sales for total year
2008 of $152 million for industrial and transportation, which was offset by a
corresponding decrease in net sales for safety, security and protection
services.
3m acquired aearo holding corp., the parent company of aearo
technologies inc. (hereafter referred to as aearo), in april2008. aearo
manufactures and sells personal protection and energy absorbing products
through the industrial retail channels and certain safety products through the
consumer retail channels. the consumer retail portion of aearos business
manufactures and markets personal safety products (including head, eye, face
and hearing products, reflective vests, protective coveralls, and first aid
kits) to the do-it-yourself consumer retail markets. the do-it-yourself retail
market portion of 3ms aearo business (previously in the occupational health
and environmental safety division within the safety, security and protection
services business segment) was transferred to the construction and home
improvement division within the consumer and office business segment. the
preceding product moves resulted in an increase in net sales for total year
2008 of $49 million for consumer and office, which was offset by a
corresponding decrease in net sales for safety, security and protection
services.
also, during the first
quarter of 2009, 3m changed its segment reporting measures to include dual
credit to business segments for certain u.s. sales and related operating
income. management now evaluates each of its six operating business segments
based on net sales and operating income performance, including dual credit u.s.
reporting. this change was made to further incentivize u.s. sales growth. as a
result, 3m now provides additional (dual) credit to those business segments
selling products in the u.s. to an external customer when that segment is not
the primary seller of the product. for example, certain respirators are
primarily sold by the occupational health and environmental safety division
within the safety, security and protection services business segment; however,
the industrial and transportation business segment also sells this product to
certain customers in its u.s. markets. in this example, the non-primary selling
segment (industrial and transportation) would also receive credit for the
associated net sales it initiated and the related approximate operating income.
the assigned operating income related to dual credit activity may differ from
operating income that would result from actual costs associated with such
sales. the offset to the dual credit business segment reporting is reflected as
a reconciling item entitled elimination of dual credit, such that sales and
operating income for the u.s. in total are unchanged.
3ms businesses are
organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in
products, technologies and services. 3m continues to manage its operations in
six operating business segments: industrial and transportation; health care;
consumer and office; safety, security and protection services; display and
graphics; and electro and communications. 3ms six business segments bring
together common or related 3m technologies, enhancing the development of
innovative products and services and providing for efficient sharing of
business resources. these segments have worldwide responsibility for virtually
all 3m product lines. 3m is not dependent on any single product/service or
market. certain small businesses and lab-sponsored products, as well as various
corporate assets and expenses, are not attributed to the business segments.
transactions among reportable segments are recorded at cost.
the financial information
presented herein reflects the impact of all of the preceding segment structure
changes for all periods presented.

corporate
and unallocated operating income includes a variety of miscellaneous items,
such as corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and
losses, insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation and
environmental expenses, corporate restructuring charges and certain under- or
over-absorbed costs (e.g. pension) that the company may choose not to allocate
directly to its business segments. because this category includes a variety of
miscellaneous items, it is subject to fluctuation on a quarterly and annual
basis.
table of contents
3m is an integrated enterprise characterized by
substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and inventory transfers.
therefore, management does not represent that its business segments, if
operated independently, would report the operating income and other financial information
shown. segment operating income and assets in the preceding table include
allocations resulting from the shared utilization of certain corporate or
otherwise unallocated assets. however, the separate amounts stated for segment
depreciation, amortization, and capital expenditures are based on secondary
performance measures used by management that do not include allocations of
certain corporate items.
segment
assets for the operating business segments (excluding corporate and
unallocated) primarily include accounts receivable; inventory; property, plant
and equipment  net; goodwill
and intangible assets; and other miscellaneous assets. assets included in
corporate and unallocated principally are cash, cash equivalents and marketable
securities; insurance receivables; deferred income taxes; certain investments
and other assets, including prepaid pension assets. corporate and unallocated
assets can change from year to year due to changes in cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities, changes in prepaid pension benefits, and changes in
other unallocated asset categories.
the
most significant items impacting 2009 and 2008 results were restructuring
actions and exit activities. the most significant items impacting 2007 results
are the net gain on sale of the pharmaceuticals business (within the health
care segment) and restructuring and other actions. refer to note 4 for
discussion of restructuring actions and exit activities and note 2 for
discussion of divestitures.
note 18. geographic areas
geographic
area information is used by the company as a secondary performance measure to
manage its businesses. export sales and certain income and expense items are
generally reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m
customers are made.
