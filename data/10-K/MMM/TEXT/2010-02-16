RESEARCH

AND PATENTS

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT CONSTITUTES AN IMPORTANT PART OF 3MS ACTIVITIES AND HAS BEEN A

TOTALED $1.293 BILLION IN 2009, $1.404 BILLION IN 2008 AND $1.368 BILLION IN

APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND IMPROVED

PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, TOTALED $838 MILLION IN 2009, $851 MILLION IN 2008 AND

$788 MILLION IN 2007. RELATED EXPENSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT

PROVIDED BY 3M TO CUSTOMERS WHO ARE USING EXISTING 3M PRODUCTS; INTERNALLY

DEVELOPED PATENT COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE COSTS AND FEES INCURRED TO PREPARE, FILE,

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES GENERATE A STEADY STREAM OF INVENTIONS THAT

ARE COVERED BY NEW PATENTS. PATENTS APPLICABLE TO SPECIFIC PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR

VARYING PERIODS ACCORDING TO THE DATE OF PATENT APPLICATION FILING OR PATENT

GRANT AND THE LEGAL TERM OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT

PROTECTION IS OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY A PATENT, WHICH CAN

VARY

5

TABLE OF

CONTENTS

FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY,

DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE AND THE AVAILABILITY

OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN THE COUNTRY.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT

ITS PATENTS PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN MANY OF ITS BUSINESSES.

IN GENERAL, NO SINGLE PATENT OR GROUP OF RELATED PATENTS IS IN ITSELF ESSENTIAL

TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE OR TO ANY OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE

IMPORTANCE OF PATENTS IN THE DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT IS DESCRIBED IN PERFORMANCE

BY BUSINESS SEGMENT  DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS BUSINESS IN PART II, ITEM 7,

OF THIS FORM 10-K.

RAW MATERIALS

IN 2009, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED COST DECREASES IN

MOST RAW MATERIALS AND TRANSPORTATION FUEL COSTS. THIS WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER

BASIC FEEDSTOCK COSTS, PARTICULARLY METALS AND OIL DERIVED MATERIALS. TO DATE,

THE COMPANY IS RECEIVING SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF ALL RAW MATERIALS TO MEET ITS

REASONABLY FORESEEABLE PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT

FUTURE SHORTAGES OF RAW MATERIALS OR THE IMPACT ANY SUCH SHORTAGES WOULD HAVE.

3M HAS AVOIDED DISRUPTION TO ITS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS THROUGH CAREFUL

MANAGEMENT OF EXISTING RAW MATERIAL INVENTORIES AND DEVELOPMENT AND

QUALIFICATION OF ADDITIONAL SUPPLY SOURCES. 3M MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS

THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD

PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

3MS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY

NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AROUND THE WORLD. 3M HAS MADE, AND

PLANS TO CONTINUE MAKING, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE

LAWS. 3M IS ALSO INVOLVED IN REMEDIATION ACTIONS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS FROM PAST OPERATIONS AT CERTAIN SITES (REFER TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND

OTHER LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES IN NOTE 14, COMMITMENTS AND

CONTINGENCIES).

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXISTING

CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR

FUTURE REVENUES ARE EXPENSED. RESERVES FOR LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED REMEDIATION

COSTS ARE RECORDED ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY

STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION. ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE

OPERATIONS GENERALLY ARE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES.

IN 2009, 3M EXPENDED ABOUT $15 MILLION FOR CAPITAL

PROJECTS RELATED TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS AMOUNT EXCLUDES EXPENDITURES

FOR REMEDIATION ACTIONS RELATING TO EXISTING MATTERS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS

THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE REVENUES, WHICH ARE EXPENSED.

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES HAVE INCLUDED POLLUTION CONTROL

DEVICES  SUCH AS WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT IMPROVEMENTS, SCRUBBERS,

CONTAINMENT STRUCTURES, SOLVENT RECOVERY UNITS AND THERMAL OXIDIZERS  AT NEW

AND EXISTING FACILITIES CONSTRUCTED OR UPGRADED IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF

BUSINESS. CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS POLICIES STRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (OTHER THAN FOR REMEDIATION PROJECTS) FOR

KNOWN PROJECTS ARE PRESENTLY EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $22 MILLION OVER THE

NEXT TWO YEARS FOR NEW OR EXPANDED PROGRAMS TO BUILD FACILITIES OR MODIFY

MANUFACTURING PROCESSES TO MINIMIZE WASTE AND REDUCE EMISSIONS.

WHILE THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE

FUTURE COSTS OF SUCH CLEANUP ACTIVITIES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING

COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

BY REFERENCE INTO AND CONSIDERED AN INTEGRAL PART OF PART II, ITEM 7, MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

* RESULTS ARE IMPACTED BY

THE EFFECTS OF, AND CHANGES IN, WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC AND CAPITAL MARKETS

CONDITIONS.

THE

COMPANY OPERATES IN MORE THAN 65 COUNTRIES AND DERIVES APPROXIMATELY 63 PERCENT

OF ITS REVENUES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE

BEYOND ITS CONTROL, SUCH AS DISRUPTIONS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS OR DOWNTURNS IN

ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN SPECIFIC COUNTRIES OR REGIONS, OR IN THE VARIOUS

INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES; SOCIAL, POLITICAL OR LABOR CONDITIONS

IN SPECIFIC COUNTRIES OR REGIONS; OR ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE AVAILABILITY AND

COST OF CAPITAL, INTEREST RATES, TAX RATES, OR REGULATIONS IN THE JURISDICTIONS

IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES.

* THE COMPANYS CREDIT

RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO 3MS COST OF CAPITAL.

THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE THE

COMPANYS CREDIT PROFILE AND HAVE ASSIGNED DEBT RATINGS TO 3M THAT ARE NEAR THE

TOP OF THE RATINGS SPECTRUM. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS,

WHICH INCLUDE FINANCIAL STRENGTH, BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RISK, AS WELL AS

TRANSPARENCY WITH RATING AGENCIES AND TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE

COMPANY HAS AN AA- CREDIT RATING, WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK, FROM STANDARD &

POORS AND AN AA2 CREDIT RATING, WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK, FROM MOODYS INVESTORS

SERVICE. THE COMPANYS STRONG RATINGS SERVE TO LOWER 3MS BORROWING COSTS AND

FACILITATE ACCESS TO A VARIETY OF LENDERS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT

RATINGS LEVEL COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE COMPANYS COST OF FUNDS, LIQUIDITY AND

ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS.

* THE COMPANYS RESULTS ARE

AFFECTED BY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMER PREFERENCES.

DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, WHICH

IMPACTS REVENUE AND PROFIT MARGINS, IS AFFECTED BY (I) THE DEVELOPMENT AND

TIMING OF THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS; (II) THE COMPANYS

RESPONSE TO DOWNWARD PRICING TO STAY COMPETITIVE; (III) CHANGES IN

CUSTOMER ORDER PATTERNS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF INVENTORY MAINTAINED

BY CUSTOMERS AND THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER PURCHASES WHICH MAY BE AFFECTED BY

ANNOUNCED PRICE CHANGES, CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, OR THE

CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE INCENTIVE GOALS; AND (IV) CHANGES IN

CUSTOMERS PREFERENCES FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE SUCCESS OF PRODUCTS

OFFERED BY OUR COMPETITORS, AND CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DESIGNS FOR THEIR PRODUCTS

THAT CAN AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR SOME OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

* FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THOSE RATES MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO

REALIZE PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN ITS SALES AND EARNINGS.

BECAUSE THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND APPROXIMATELY 63 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ITS ABILITY TO REALIZE PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN

SALES AND EARNINGS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS

SIGNIFICANTLY AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES.

* THE COMPANYS GROWTH

OBJECTIVES ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TIMING AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF ITS NEW

PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY RENEW ITS PIPELINE OF

NEW PRODUCTS AND TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

THIS ABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO

IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW PRODUCTS, OBTAIN ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION,

OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT NEW

PRODUCTS WILL PROVE TO BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL.

* THE COMPANYS FUTURE

RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COSTS AND AVAILABILITY OF PURCHASED

COMPONENTS, COMPOUNDS, RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY, INCLUDING OIL AND NATURAL GAS

AND THEIR DERIVATIVES, DUE TO SHORTAGES, INCREASED DEMAND, SUPPLY

INTERRUPTIONS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS, NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON VARIOUS

COMPONENTS, COMPOUNDS, RAW MATERIALS, AND ENERGY (INCLUDING OIL AND NATURAL GAS

AND THEIR DERIVATIVES) SUPPLIED BY OTHERS FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF ITS

PRODUCTS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ANY OF ITS SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS COULD BE

INTERRUPTED DUE TO NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS AND OTHER EVENTS, OR BE

TERMINATED IN THE FUTURE. ANY SUSTAINED INTERRUPTION IN THE COMPANYS RECEIPT

OF ADEQUATE SUPPLIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY. IN

ADDITION, WHILE THE COMPANY HAS A PROCESS TO MINIMIZE VOLATILITY IN COMPONENT

AND MATERIAL PRICING, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE

TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS OR THAT FUTURE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS OR

SHORTAGES WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

* ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC

ALLIANCES, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER UNUSUAL EVENTS RESULTING FROM PORTFOLIO

MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AND OTHER EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, AND POSSIBLE

ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.

THE COMPANY MONITORS ITS BUSINESS

PORTFOLIO AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND HAS MADE AND MAY CONTINUE TO MAKE

ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, DIVESTITURES AND CHANGES TO ITS

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE. WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE

AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO INTEGRATE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES QUICKLY AND

OBTAIN THE ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES.

* THE COMPANYS FUTURE

RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF THE COMPANY GENERATES FEWER PRODUCTIVITY

IMPROVEMENTS THAN ESTIMATED.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES VARIOUS TOOLS, SUCH AS LEAN SIX

SIGMA, TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT ALL OF THE PROJECTED PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE REALIZED.

* THE COMPANYS FUTURE

RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING

THOSE INVOLVING PRODUCT LIABILITY, ANTITRUST, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHER MATTERS.

THE OUTCOME OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

MAY DIFFER FROM THE COMPANYS EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE THE OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION,

INCLUDING REGULATORY MATTERS, ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO RELIABLY PREDICT. VARIOUS

FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN LEAD THE COMPANY TO CHANGE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF

LIABILITIES AND RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES WHERE APPLICABLE, OR MAKE SUCH

ESTIMATES FOR MATTERS PREVIOUSLY NOT SUSCEPTIBLE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES, SUCH

AS A SIGNIFICANT JUDICIAL RULING OR JUDGMENT, A SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT,

SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A FUTURE

ADVERSE RULING, SETTLEMENT OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE

CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD. FOR A MORE DETAILED

DISCUSSION OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE COMPANY AND THE ASSOCIATED

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, SEE THE DISCUSSION IN NOTE 14.

OVERVIEW

3M IS A DIVERSIFIED

GLOBAL MANUFACTURER, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATOR AND MARKETER OF A WIDE VARIETY OF

PRODUCTS. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, 3M MADE CERTAIN BUSINESS SEGMENT

REALIGNMENTS, INCLUDING BOTH PRODUCT MOVES BETWEEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND

REPORTING CHANGES RELATED TO REVISED U.S. PERFORMANCE MEASURES. THE FINANCIAL

INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES FOR ALL

PERIODS PRESENTED. 3M MANAGES ITS OPERATIONS IN SIX OPERATING BUSINESS

SEGMENTS: INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION; HEALTH CARE; CONSUMER AND OFFICE;

SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS; AND ELECTRO AND

COMMUNICATIONS.

3MS QUARTERLY

YEAR-ON-YEAR BUSINESS RESULTS GOT STRONGER AS 2009 PROGRESSED, WITH FIRST

NINE-MONTH 2009 YEAR-ON-YEAR COMPARISONS SIGNIFICANTLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY

THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT BEGAN IMPACTING 3M IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008.

FOR TOTAL YEAR 2009, WHILE SALES DECLINED 8.5 PERCENT AND ORGANIC VOLUMES

DECLINED 9.5 PERCENT, WORLDWIDE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IS EXPECTED TO BE DOWN BY

A SIMILAR AMOUNT AND 3MS SALES PERFORMANCE WAS IN LINE WITH THE OVERALL ECONOMY.

3M RESTRUCTURED A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES DURING THE YEAR, RESULTING IN 2009 TOTAL

YEAR SAVINGS OF ALMOST $400 MILLION, WITH ESTIMATED ADDITIONAL INCREMENTAL

SAVINGS OF MORE THAN $150 MILLION IN 2010. IN ADDITION, 3M AMENDED ITS POLICY

REGARDING BANKED VACATION, WHICH ADDED MORE THAN $100 MILLION TO OPERATING

INCOME IN 2009, WITH A SLIGHTLY LOWER BENEFIT EXPECTED IN 2010. 3M ALSO ENACTED

TEMPORARY FURLOUGHS WHERE APPROPRIATE, FROZE MERIT PAY AND REDUCED INDIRECT

SPENDING. FINALLY, IN THE MIDST OF THIS ECONOMIC DOWNTURN, 3M INVESTED $1.3

BILLION IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES DURING 2009.

3M HAS BEEN AGGRESSIVELY

RESTRUCTURING THE COMPANY SINCE EARLY 2008 AND CONTINUED THIS EFFORT THROUGH

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, WITH THESE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES

IN THE AGGREGATE RESULTING IN A REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY 6,400 POSITIONS. 3M

AGGRESSIVELY REDUCED STRUCTURAL COSTS ACROSS THE COMPANY, INCLUDING IN THE

FACTORIES. THE FOCUS NOW IS TO ACCELERATE GROWTH IN THE VARIOUS BUSINESSES AND

TO ADD ONLY THOSE EXPENSES THAT ARE ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY. 3M ANNOUNCED THE

REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY 200 POSITIONS IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, WITH THE

MAJORITY OF THOSE OCCURRING IN WESTERN EUROPE AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, THE

UNITED STATES. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, 3M PERMANENTLY REDUCED

APPROXIMATELY 900 POSITIONS SPANNING MANY BUSINESSES AND GEOGRAPHIES, AND IN

THE UNITED STATES ANOTHER 700 PEOPLE ACCEPTED A VOLUNTARY RETIREMENT OPTION. 3M

EXPECTS THAT A SMALL PORTION OF THOSE WHO ACCEPTED THE VOLUNTARY SEPARATION

WILL BE REPLACED; THUS, ON A NET BASIS, 3M ESTIMATES AN EMPLOYMENT LEVEL

DECLINE OF APPROXIMATELY 1,400 TO 1,500 DUE TO THESE SECOND QUARTER

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS. IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, 3M ANNOUNCED THE

ELIMINATION OF APPROXIMATELY 1,200 POSITIONS. IN ADDITION, 3M ANNOUNCED

REDUCTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY 3,500 POSITIONS IN 2008, WITH 2,400 OF THESE

REDUCTIONS ANNOUNCED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. THE RELATED NET

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS REDUCED NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE

TO 3M FOR YEAR 2009 BY $119 MILLION, OR $0.17 PER DILUTED SHARE. SPECIAL ITEMS

REDUCED NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M FOR YEAR 2008 BY $194 MILLION, OR $0.28

PER DILUTED SHARE, WITH $140 MILLION, OR $0.20 PER DILUTED SHARE, IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2008. REFER TO THE SPECIAL ITEMS DISCUSSION AT THE END OF THIS

OVERVIEW SECTION FOR MORE DETAIL.

FOURTH-QUARTER 2009 SALES

TOTALED $6.1 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 11.1 PERCENT FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2008, WITH ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND MAJOR GEOGRAPHIC AREAS SHOWING

IMPROVEMENT. NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M WAS $935 MILLION, OR $1.30 PER

DILUTED SHARE. THIS COMPARES TO $536 MILLION, OR $0.77 PER DILUTED SHARE, WHICH

INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS, IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2008.

13

TABLE OF

CONTENTS

SALES IN 2009 TOTALED

$23.1 BILLION, A DECREASE OF 8.5 PERCENT FROM 2008. INCLUDING THE PRECEDING

SPECIAL ITEMS, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M WAS $3.193 BILLION, OR $4.52 PER

DILUTED SHARE, IN 2009, VERSUS $3.460 BILLION, OR $4.89 PER DILUTED SHARE, IN

2008. IN 2009, THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED YEAR-ON-YEAR

COMPARISONS FOR 3MS BUSINESSES. SUBSTANTIAL END-MARKET DECLINES AND INVENTORY

TAKEDOWNS IN MAJOR INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING AUTOMOTIVE, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS AND

GENERAL INDUSTRIAL MANUFACTURING, RESULTED IN SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER SALES AND

INCOME. ACCORDINGLY, 3M REDUCED ITS COST STRUCTURE, LOWERED MANUFACTURING

OUTPUT AND INTENSIFIED ITS ATTENTION TO OPERATIONAL IMPROVEMENT. THE

COMBINATION OF THESE ACTIONS DROVE OPERATING INCOME MARGINS OF 20.8 PERCENT IN

2009, COMPARED TO 20.6 PERCENT IN 2008. RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER SPECIAL

ITEMS REDUCED THIS OPERATING INCOME MARGIN BY APPROXIMATELY ONE PERCENTAGE

POINT IN BOTH 2009 AND 2008.

IN JANUARY 2007, 3M

COMPLETED THE SALE OF ITS BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS, RESULTING IN A GAIN

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007. IN ADDITION, 3M RECORDED A GAIN RELATED TO THE

SALE OF ITS OPTICOM PRIORITY CONTROL SYSTEMS AND CANOGA TRAFFIC DETECTION

BUSINESSES IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007. IN 2007, THESE GAINS ON SALE OF

BUSINESSES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY RESTRUCTURING AND THE NET IMPACT OF OTHER

SPECIAL ITEMS. REFER TO SPECIAL ITEMS AT THE END OF THIS OVERVIEW SECTION FOR

ADDITIONAL DETAILS. INCLUDING THESE SPECIAL ITEMS, IN 2007, 3M REPORTED NET

SALES OF $24.462 BILLION AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M OF $4.096 BILLION,

OR $5.60 PER DILUTED SHARE.

IN 2009, WHILE SALES

DECLINED 8.5 PERCENT FOR THE TOTAL YEAR, THIS WAS SIMILAR TO THE OVERALL

ECONOMY AND CLOSE TO THE ESTIMATED DECLINE IN WORLDWIDE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION.

QUARTERLY YEAR-ON-YEAR COMPARISONS IMPROVED THROUGHOUT 2009. SALES DECLINED

21.3 PERCENT IN THE FIRST QUARTER, 15.1 PERCENT IN THE SECOND QUARTER AND 5.6

PERCENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER, BUT IMPROVED 11.1 PERCENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.

REFER TO THE SECTIONS ENTITLED PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT AND PERFORMANCE

BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA LATER IN MD&A FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF SALES

CHANGE.

IN 2008, WORLDWIDE SALES

GROWTH WAS 3.3 PERCENT. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH WAS 1.4 PERCENT FOR 2008,

INCLUDING A 3.3 PERCENTAGE POINT BENEFIT FROM ACQUISITIONS. LOCAL-CURRENCY

SALES INCREASED 17.1 PERCENT IN SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES

(INCLUDING 13.0 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM ACQUISITIONS), 6.7 PERCENT IN HEALTH

CARE (INCLUDING 1.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM ACQUISITIONS), 4.1 PERCENT IN

INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION (INCLUDING 3.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM

ACQUISITIONS), AND 1.0 PERCENT IN CONSUMER AND OFFICE (INCLUDING 1.8 PERCENTAGE

POINTS FROM ACQUISITIONS). LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES DECLINED 1.6 PERCENT IN ELECTRO

AND COMMUNICATIONS AND 17.9 PERCENT IN DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS.

3M GENERATED $4.9 BILLION

OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN 2009, AN INCREASE OF $408 MILLION WHEN COMPARED TO

2008. THIS FOLLOWED AN INCREASE OF $287 MILLION WHEN COMPARING 2008 TO 2007. IN

2009, 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY UTILIZED APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION OF CASH

EACH YEAR TO PAY DIVIDENDS. IN FEBRUARY 2007, 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

AUTHORIZED A TWO-YEAR SHARE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $7.0 BILLION FOR THE PERIOD

FROM FEBRUARY 12, 2007 TO FEBRUARY 28, 2009. IN FEBRUARY 2009,

3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXTENDED THIS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION UNTIL THE

REMAINING AMOUNT IS FULLY UTILIZED. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY

$2.6 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE. WITH THE COMPANYS EMPHASIS ON

MAINTAINING AMPLE LIQUIDITY AND ENHANCING BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH, SHARE

REPURCHASE ACTIVITY WAS SUSPENDED BEGINNING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. THE

EXTENSION OF THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY TO RESUME REPURCHASE ACTIVITY

WHEN BUSINESS CONDITIONS PERMIT. IN 2009 NO BROKER REPURCHASES OF STOCK WERE

MADE,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPARED TO REPURCHASES

OF 3M COMMON STOCK OF $1.6 BILLION IN 2008 (PRIMARILY IN THE FIRST NINE MONTHS

OF 2008) AND REPURCHASES OF 3M COMMON STOCK OF $3.2 BILLION IN 2007. IN FEBRUARY 2010,

3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A DIVIDEND INCREASE OF 2.9 PERCENT FOR 2010,

MARKING THE 52ND CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF DIVIDEND INCREASES FOR 3M. 3MS DEBT TO

TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL CAPITAL DEFINED AS DEBT PLUS EQUITY) AT DECEMBER 31,

2009 WAS 30 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 39 PERCENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. A

PORTION OF THE INCREASE IN DEBT AT YEAR-END 2008 WAS THE RESULT OF A STRATEGY

TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN A CASH BUFFER IN THE U.S. GIVEN THE DIFFICULT MARKET

ENVIRONMENT AT THAT POINT IN TIME. 3M HAS AN AA- CREDIT RATING WITH A STABLE

OUTLOOK FROM STANDARD & POORS AND AN AA2 CREDIT RATING WITH A STABLE

OUTLOOK FROM MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE. IN ADDITION TO CASH ON HAND, THE

COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS TO MEET CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED

GROWTH AND ACQUISITION INVESTMENT FUNDING NEEDS.

IN 2009, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED COST DECREASES IN

MOST RAW MATERIALS AND TRANSPORTATION FUEL COSTS. THIS WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER

BASIC FEEDSTOCK COSTS, PARTICULARLY METALS AND OIL DERIVED MATERIALS. TO DATE

THE COMPANY IS RECEIVING SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF ALL RAW MATERIALS TO MEET ITS

REASONABLY FORESEEABLE PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT

FUTURE SHORTAGES OF RAW MATERIALS OR THE IMPACT ANY SUCH SHORTAGES WOULD HAVE.

3M HAS AVOIDED DISRUPTION TO ITS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS THROUGH CAREFUL

MANAGEMENT OF EXISTING RAW MATERIAL INVENTORIES AND DEVELOPMENT AND

QUALIFICATION OF ADDITIONAL SUPPLY SOURCES. 3M MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS

THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD

PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

IN 2009, 3M CHANGED ITS ANNUAL STOCK OPTION AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT DATE TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN THE AWARD WITH THE

TIMING OF THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE REVIEW PROCESS. IN 2009 AND FORWARD, UNDER

THE ANNUAL GRANT, 3M WILL GRANT SHARES IN FEBRUARY INSTEAD OF MAY AS

IN PREVIOUS YEARS. ACCOUNTING RULES REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF EXPENSE UNDER

A NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING PERIOD APPROACH, REQUIRING COMPENSATION EXPENSE

RECOGNITION WHEN AN EMPLOYEE IS ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE. 3M EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED

STATES ARE ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE AT AGE 55 AND AFTER HAVING COMPLETED FIVE YEARS

OF SERVICE. APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT OF THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARD

EXPENSE DOLLARS ARE FOR THIS RETIREE-ELIGIBLE POPULATION. THEREFORE, IN 2007

AND 2008, THE SECOND QUARTER OF EACH YEAR (BECAUSE OF THE MAY GRANT DATE)

REFLECTED HIGHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAN THE OTHER QUARTERS. IN

2009, THE RETIREE-ELIGIBLE IMPACT SHIFTED TO THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009. IN

ADDITION, BOTH THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 REFLECTED HIGHER

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE EARLIER FEBRUARY GRANT

DATE. THESE AND OTHER FACTORS RESULTED IN HIGHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST

IN 2009 WHEN COMPARED TO 2008. REFER TO NOTE 16 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF

THE COMPANYS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS.

3MS PENSION PLANS WERE 90 PERCENT FUNDED AT YEAR-END

2009. THE U.S. QUALIFIED PLAN, WHICH IS APPROXIMATELY 68 PERCENT OF THE

WORLDWIDE PENSION OBLIGATION, WAS 96 PERCENT FUNDED, AND THE INTERNATIONAL

PLANS WERE 83 PERCENT FUNDED. ASSET RETURNS IN 2009 FOR THE U.S. QUALIFIED PLAN

WERE 12.6 PERCENT WHILE THE YEAR-END 2009 DISCOUNT RATE WAS 5.77%, DOWN 0.37

PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM THE 2008 DISCOUNT RATE OF 6.14%. 3M EXPECTS TO

CONTRIBUTE $500 MILLION TO $700 MILLION OF CASH TO ITS GLOBAL PENSION PLANS IN

2010. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED MINIMUM PENSION CONTRIBUTION

OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2010. 3M EXPECTS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT EXPENSE IN 2010 TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $130 MILLION PRE-TAX, OR

12 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE, WHEN COMPARED TO 2009. REFER TO CRITICAL ACCOUNTING

ESTIMATES WITHIN MD&A AND NOTE 11 (PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLANS) FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING 3MS PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT

PLANS.

IN 2009, NET LOSSES FOR

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ACTIONS DECREASED OPERATING INCOME BY $194 MILLION AND

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M BY $119 MILLION, OR $0.17 PER DILUTED SHARE. 2009

INCLUDED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ($209 MILLION PRE-TAX, $128 MILLION AFTER TAX

AND NONCONTROLLING INTEREST), WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GAIN ON SALE OF

REAL ESTATE ($15 MILLION PRE-TAX, $9 MILLION AFTER TAX). THE GAIN ON SALE OF

REAL ESTATE RELATES TO THE JUNE 2009 SALE OF A NEW JERSEY ROOFING GRANULE

FACILITY, WHICH IS RECORDED IN COST OF SALES WITHIN THE SAFETY, SECURITY AND

PROTECTION SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENT. RESTRUCTURING IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL

IN NOTE 4 (RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES).

IN 2008, NET LOSSES FOR

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ACTIONS DECREASED OPERATING INCOME BY $269 MILLION AND

NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M BY $194 MILLION, OR $0.28 PER DILUTED SHARE. 2008

AND NONCONTROLLING INTEREST), EXIT ACTIVITIES ($58 MILLION PRE-TAX, $43 MILLION

AFTER-TAX) AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE SALE OF BUSINESSES ($23 MILLION PRE-TAX,

$32 MILLION AFTER-TAX), WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GAIN ON SALE OF REAL

TRANSACTION RELATIVE TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE LOCATION IN ITALY.

IN 2007, GAINS ON SALE OF

BUSINESSES AND REAL ESTATE, NET OF RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS, INCREASED

OPERATING INCOME BY $681 MILLION AND NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M BY $448

RELATED TO THE SALE OF BUSINESSES ($849 MILLION PRE-TAX, $550 MILLION

AFTER-TAX) AND A GAIN ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE ($52 MILLION PRE-TAX, $37 MILLION

AFTER-TAX), WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITIES ($134 MILLION PRE-TAX, $83 MILLION AFTER-TAX), RESTRUCTURING

ACTIONS ($41 MILLION PRE-TAX, $27 MILLION AFTER-TAX), AND OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES

($45 MILLION PRE-TAX, $29 MILLION AFTER-TAX). THESE ITEMS, EXCEPT THE GAIN ON

SALE OF REAL ESTATE, ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 2 (ACQUISITIONS AND

DIVESTITURES), NOTE 4 (RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES) AND NOTE 14

(COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES). GAINS ON SALE OF BUSINESSES INCLUDE THE

SECOND-QUARTER 2007 SALE OF 3MS OPTICOM PRIORITY CONTROL SYSTEMS AND CANOGA

TRAFFIC DETECTION BUSINESSES, AND THE FIRST-QUARTER 2007 SALE OF THE GLOBAL

BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IN EUROPE. CONCERNING THE REAL ESTATE SALE, 3M

COST OF SALES.

COST OF SALES INCLUDES

MANUFACTURING, ENGINEERING AND FREIGHT COSTS. COST OF SALES AS A PERCENT OF NET

SALES DECREASED 0.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008. AS DISCUSSED IN

NOTE 4 (RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES), IN 2009, 3M RECORDED $209

MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, OF WHICH $110 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN COST OF

DECREASE IN MATERIAL

COSTS. THE COMPANY WAS ALSO ABLE TO MITIGATE ORGANIC VOLUME DECLINES THROUGH

REDUCTIONS IN 3MS MANUFACTURING COST STRUCTURE. FINALLY, IN RESPONSE TO

DETERIORATING CONDITIONS IN VENEZUELA, 3M VENEZUELA SWAPPED BOLIVARS INTO U.S.

DOLLARS IN 2009. WHILE INCREASING COST OF SALES, THESE ACTIONS MITIGATED 3MS

EXPOSURE TO FUTURE EXCHANGE RATE RISKS.

COST OF SALES AS A

PERCENT OF NET SALES INCREASED 0.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007,

WITH THIS INCREASE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN OPTICAL SYSTEMS SALES AND

THE RAPID VOLUME DECLINES OF CERTAIN OTHER BUSINESSES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.

FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE YEAR 3MS BROAD-BASED PORTFOLIO PERFORMED AS EXPECTED,

WITH BENEFITS FROM SELLING PRICE INCREASES, FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION, AND A

CONTINUOUS FOCUS ON DRIVING OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, HELPING TO OFFSET RAW

MATERIAL INFLATION OF APPROXIMATELY 4 PERCENT FOR 2008, COMPARED WITH 2007. IN

2008, RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT COSTS INCREASED COST OF SALES BY $122 MILLION, OR

0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, SIMILAR TO THE 0.3 PERCENTAGE

POINT IMPACT IN 2007.

SELLING,

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES INCREASED 0.4

PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2009 WHEN COMPARED TO 2008, BUT IN DOLLARS DECREASED $338

MILLION, HELPED BY RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ACTIONS. IN THE SALES AND MARKETING

AREA, ADVERTISING AND MERCHANDISING COSTS WERE DOWN YEAR-ON-YEAR, BUT WERE UP

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. AS INDICATED IN NOTE 4, IN 2009, $91 MILLION IN

RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES WAS RECORDED IN SG&A, WHICH INCREASED SG&A AS A

PERCENT OF SALES BY 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS. IN 2008, RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND

EXIT ACTIVITIES, NET OF A GAIN ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE, INCREASED SG&A BY

$111 MILLION, WHICH INCREASED SG&A AS A PERCENT OF SALES BY 0.5 PERCENTAGE

POINTS.

SELLING, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES INCREASED 0.3

PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2008 WHEN COMPARED TO 2007, OR 4.6 PERCENT IN DOLLARS. IN

2008, SG&A EXPENSES RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GAIN ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE, WHICH COMBINED

INCREASED SG&A BY $111 MILLION, OR 0.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS, SIMILAR TO THE

0.4 PERCENTAGE POINT IMPACT IN 2007. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, AS PART OF

ITS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, 3M TOOK AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS TO REDUCE GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND ALSO PARED BACK SELLING AND MARKETING COSTS IN

CERTAIN BUSINESSES.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND

RELATED EXPENSES (R&D) WERE 5.6 PERCENT OF NET SALES IN 2009, 2008 AND

2007. R&D EXPENSES IN DOLLARS DECLINED APPROXIMATELY 8 PERCENT IN 2009

COMPARED TO 2008, FOLLOWING AN INCREASE OF 2.6 PERCENT WHEN COMPARING 2008 TO

2007. 3M HAS CONTINUED TO SUPPORT ITS KEY LARGER PROGRAMS, BUT OVERALL DOLLAR

SPENDING HAS BEEN IMPACTED BY COMPANY-WIDE COST-CUTTING INITIATIVES SUCH AS

REDUCTIONS IN INDIRECT SPENDING AND THE BANKED VACATION POLICY CHANGE.

GAIN/LOSS FROM SALE OF BUSINESSES.

IN

JUNE 2008, 3M COMPLETED THE SALE OF HIGHJUMP SOFTWARE TO BATTERY VENTURES,

A TECHNOLOGY VENTURE CAPITAL AND PRIVATE EQUITY FIRM. 3M RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF

$85 MILLION FOR THIS TRANSACTION AND RECOGNIZED, NET OF ASSETS SOLD,

TRANSACTION AND OTHER COSTS, A PRE-TAX LOSS OF $23 MILLION (RECORDED IN THE

SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES SEGMENT) IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF

THE DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT) IN 2007.

OPERATING INCOME.

3M USES OPERATING INCOME

AS ONE OF ITS PRIMARY BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TOOLS. OPERATING

INCOME WAS 20.8 PERCENT OF SALES IN 2009 COMPARED TO 20.6 PERCENT OF SALES IN

2008. 2009 WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, NET OF A GAIN ON

SALE OF REAL ESTATE, WHICH COMBINED DECREASED OPERATING INCOME BY 0.9

PERCENTAGE POINTS ($194 MILLION). 2008 WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY RESTRUCTURING

ACTIONS, EXIT ACTIVITIES AND A LOSS ON SALE OF BUSINESSES THAT WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A GAIN ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE, WHICH COMBINED DECREASED OPERATING

INCOME BY 1.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS ($269 MILLION). OPERATING INCOME MARGINS OF

25.3 PERCENT IN 2007 WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY 2.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS ($681

THE

INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT SERVES A BROAD RANGE OF MARKETS, SUCH AS

APPLIANCE, PAPER AND PACKAGING, FOOD AND BEVERAGE, ELECTRONICS, AUTOMOTIVE

ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) AND AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET (AUTO BODY

SHOPS AND RETAIL). INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION PRODUCTS INCLUDE TAPES, A WIDE

VARIETY OF COATED AND NON-WOVEN ABRASIVES, ADHESIVES, SPECIALTY MATERIALS,

FILTRATION PRODUCTS, ENERGY CONTROL PRODUCTS, CLOSURE SYSTEMS FOR PERSONAL

HYGIENE PRODUCTS, AND COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED IN THE MANUFACTURE,

REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF AUTOMOTIVE, MARINE, AIRCRAFT AND SPECIALTY VEHICLES.

FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR 2009

RESULTS.

INDUSTRIAL

AND TRANSPORTATION IS A LARGE AND HIGHLY DIVERSIFIED SET OF BUSINESSES THAT,

WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER, CORRELATE WELL WITH THE OVERALL ECONOMY. EARLY IN 2009,

THE BUSINESS SAW SIGNIFICANT SALES DECLINES THAT REQUIRED SWIFT AND AGGRESSIVE

RESTRUCTURING AND COST REDUCTION PLANS TO OFFSET THE IMPACT OF LOWER VOLUMES,

INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF LARGE INVENTORY DECLINES IN THE WHOLESALE DISTRIBUTION

CHANNEL. INVENTORIES BEGAN TO STABILIZE AROUND MID-YEAR 2009, AND IT NOW

APPEARS THAT INVENTORY AND POINT-OF-SALE LEVELS IN THIS CHANNEL ARE IN

REASONABLY GOOD BALANCE.

SALES

IN INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION ROSE 10 PERCENT TO $1.9 BILLION IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER. FOURTH QUARTER LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH WAS 4.6 PERCENT, WHICH INCLUDED

ORGANIC VOLUME GROWTH OF 3 PERCENT. FOURTH-QUARTER GROWTH WAS LED BY THE

RENEWABLE ENERGY BUSINESS AND THE AUTOMOTIVE OEM BUSINESS. 3M ALSO DROVE

POSITIVE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH IN INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES AND TAPES,

AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET AND IN DYNEON LLC, WHICH SUPPLIES FLOUROPOLYMERS AND

ELASTOMERS INTO THE OIL, GAS AND TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRIES. OTHER BUSINESSES IN

THIS SEGMENT POSTED LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES DECLINES RANGING FROM ONE TO FIVE

PERCENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. ON A REGIONAL BASIS, GROWTH WAS STRONGEST IN

LATIN AMERICA AND IN ASIA PACIFIC.

THE

COMBINATION OF POSITIVE SALES VOLUMES IN THE QUARTER, HIGHER YEAR-ON-YEAR

FACTORY PRODUCTION LEVELS AND IMPROVEMENTS IN COST STRUCTURE RESULTED IN

OPERATING INCOME GROWTH IN THE FOURTH QUARTER.

THIS SEGMENT RECORDED NET CHARGES OF $36 MILLION

RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2008. INCLUDING THESE NET CHARGES, O

PERATING INCOME IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009 INCREASED 86 PERCENT TO $397 MILLION AND OPERATING

INCOME MARGINS IMPROVED BY 8.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 20.8 PERCENT.

FULL-YEAR

2009 SALES WERE $7.1 BILLION, DOWN 12.9 PERCENT IN DOLLARS AND DOWN 10.2

PERCENT IN LOCAL CURRENCY. FOREIGN CURRENCY IMPACTS PENALIZED SALES FOR THE

YEAR BY 2.7 PERCENT.

SALES

INCREASED IN THE RENEWABLE ENERGY AND AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESSES, BUT

SALES DECREASED IN THE OTHER BUSINESSES, IMPACTED BY END-MARKET DECLINES. THIS

SEGMENT ANNOUNCED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS IN 2009, ALONG WITH PLANT SHUT-DOWNS,

FURLOUGHS AND MANDATORY VACATION ACROSS THE OPERATION. IN 2009, THIS BUSINESS

SEGMENT RECORDED CHARGES OF $88 MILLION RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, WITH

THIS CHARGE COMPRISED OF EMPLOYEE-RELATED LIABILITIES FOR SEVERANCE AND

BENEFITS OF $83 MILLION AND FIXED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $5 MILLION. INCLUDING

THESE SPECIAL ITEMS,

2009 OPERATING INCOME WAS $1.2 BILLION AND OPERATING

INCOME MARGINS WERE 17.4 PERCENT.

THIS SEGMENT RECORDED $66 MILLION RELATED TO

RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT ACTIVITIES IN 2008.

INDUSTRIAL

AND TRANSPORTATION CONTINUED TO INVEST AGGRESSIVELY TO ACCELERATE ITS GROWTH

CAPABILITY. FOR EXAMPLE, THE RENEWABLE ENERGY BUSINESS RECENTLY OPENED A NEW

LARGE-SCALE HIGH-TECH MANUFACTURING SITE IN SINGAPORE, AND THE INDUSTRIAL

ABRASIVES BUSINESS OPENED A NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART MANUFACTURING SITE IN NORTH

AMERICA. RECENTLY, 3M PURIFICATION INC. LAUNCHED A HIGH-QUALITY DISPOSABLE

FILTRATION SYSTEM FOR THE BIOPHARMACEUTICALS INDUSTRY. AND FINALLY,

21

TABLE OF

CONTENTS

THE

AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESS INTRODUCED THE 3M



DIRT TRAP PROTECTION SYSTEM, WHICH INCREASES

PAINT BOOTH PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCES DAILY MAINTENANCE COSTS IN AUTO BODY

REPAIR SHOPS.

FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR 2008

RESULTS.

2008 CAN BE CHARACTERIZED

AS A TALE OF TWO DISTINCT CHAPTERS FOR INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION. THE FIRST

WAS JANUARY THROUGH OCTOBER, CHARACTERIZED BY OUTSTANDING TOP-AND

BOTTOM-LINE GROWTH ACROSS MOST OF THE PORTFOLIO; THE SECOND CHAPTER WAS THE

COMBINED MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, WHEN MANY LARGE CUSTOMERS SLOWED

THEIR OPERATIONS.

AMONG

3MS BUSINESS SEGMENTS, INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION HAS BEEN AMONG THOSE MOST

AFFECTED BY RECENT ECONOMIC CONTRACTIONS, PARTICULARLY IN BIG INDUSTRIES SUCH

AS AUTOMOTIVE AND ELECTRONICS. WITH WORLDWIDE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IN DECLINE,

3MS INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS HAD FOURTH QUARTER 2008 SALES OF

$1.7 BILLION, AN 11.2 PERCENT DECLINE COMPARED TO 2007. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES

WERE DOWN 6.4 PERCENT, INCLUDING A POSITIVE 3.1 PERCENT IMPACT FROM

ACQUISITIONS. NOT ALL DIVISIONS WITHIN INDUSTRIAL WERE IMPACTED EQUALLY IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER. THOSE THAT ARE HEAVILY LINKED TO AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURING,

NAMELY AUTOMOTIVE OEM AND DYNEON LLC, SAW DECLINES OF MORE THAN 20 PERCENT, AS

DID BUSINESSES SELLING TO THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY, SUCH AS HIGH-TECH TAPES AND

ADHESIVES. MOST OTHER DIVISIONS EXPERIENCED LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES CONTRACTIONS

OF LESS THAN 10 PERCENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE

AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESS, WHICH POSTED POSITIVE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES

GROWTH. GEOGRAPHICALLY, FOURTH QUARTER 2008 LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES WERE DOWN IN

ALL REGIONS, WITH THE LARGEST DECLINES IN THE U.S. AND ASIA PACIFIC, FOLLOWED

BY EUROPE. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES WERE FLAT IN LATIN AMERICA. OPERATING INCOME IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER DECLINED 42 PERCENT TO $214 MILLION, WHICH INCLUDED NET

CHARGES OF $36 MILLION FOR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES.

FULL-YEAR 2008 SALES WERE

UP 7 PERCENT TO $8.2 BILLION. LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH RATES WERE STRONGEST IN THE

AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESS. 3M ALSO DROVE STRONG SALES GROWTH IN TWO OF

ITS LARGEST DIVISIONS, NAMELY ABRASIVES AND INDUSTRIAL TAPES AND ADHESIVES.

CLOSURE SYSTEMS FOR PERSONAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS ALSO SHOWED GOOD GROWTH.

GEOGRAPHICALLY, ALL MAJOR REGIONS DROVE POSITIVE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH.

STRONG MARKET PENETRATION CONTINUED IN EMERGING ECONOMIES, ESPECIALLY THE HIGH

GROWTH COUNTRIES OF BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA AND POLAND, WHERE THE BUSINESS

DROVE STRONG ORGANIC LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH. OPERATING INCOME DECLINED, BUT

INCREASED AFTER ADJUSTING FOR $66 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT

ACTIVITIES (DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW). STRONG OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE WAS THE KEY

TO PROTECTING THE BOTTOM LINE AS FULL-YEAR OPERATING MARGINS TOTALED 18.9

PERCENT, WITH OPERATING INCOME MARGINS AT 19.7 PERCENT AFTER ADJUSTING FOR

RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT ACTIVITIES.

INDUSTRIAL

AND TRANSPORTATION RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT ACTIVITIES TOTALED $66 MILLION FOR

TOTAL YEAR 2008. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

TOTALING $40 MILLION (PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $4 MILLION REDUCTION IN PREVIOUSLY

ACCRUED EXIT ACTIVITY CHARGES) WERE COMPRISED OF SEVERANCE AND RELATED BENEFITS

TOTALING $33 MILLION AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $7 MILLION. NET EXIT ACTIVITY

CHARGES OF $26 MILLION IN 2008 LARGELY RELATED TO EMPLOYEE REDUCTIONS AT AN

INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION MANUFACTURING FACILITY LOCATED IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, WHICH TOTALED $19 MILLION. THIS COMPARED TO RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND

EXIT ACTIVITIES OF $9 MILLION IN 2007.

INDUSTRIAL

AND TRANSPORTATION CONTINUED TO INVEST IN INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS ALONG WITH

COMPLEMENTARY GAP-FILL ACQUISITIONS, EVIDENCED BY THE CLOSING OF EIGHT

ACQUISITIONS IN 2008, WITH SOME OF THE LARGER ACQUISITIONS SUMMARIZED AS

FOLLOWS. IN JULY 2008, 3M ACQUIRED K&H SURFACE TECHNOLOGIES PTY. LTD.,

AN AUSTRALIAN-BASED MANUFACTURING COMPANY SPECIALIZING IN A RANGE OF REPAIR

PRODUCTS FOR THE PROFESSIONAL DO-IT-YOURSELF AUTOMOTIVE REFINISH MARKETS. IN AUGUST 2008,

3M ACQUIRED POLYFOAM PRODUCTS INC., A STRUCTURAL ADHESIVES COMPANY SPECIALIZING

IN FOAM ADHESIVES FOR TILE ROOFING AND OTHER ADHESIVE PRODUCTS FOR THE BUILDING

INDUSTRY. IN OCTOBER 2008, 3M COMPLETED ITS ACQUISITION OF EMFI S.A. AND

SAPO S.A.S., MANUFACTURERS OF POLYURETHANE-BASED STRUCTURAL ADHESIVES AND

SEALANTS HEADQUARTERED IN HAGUENAU, FRANCE. IN OCTOBER 2008, 3M ALSO

COMPLETED ITS ACQUISITION OF MEGUIARS INC., A 100-YEAR-OLD BUSINESS THAT

MANUFACTURES THE LEADING MEGUIARS BRAND OF CAR CARE PRODUCTS FOR CLEANING AND

PROTECTING AUTOMOTIVE SURFACES, WHICH IS HEADQUARTERED IN IRVINE, CALIFORNIA.

INVESTMENT.

IN

MARCH 2005, 3MS AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS COMPLETED THE PURCHASE OF 19 PERCENT

OF TI&M BETEILIGUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH (TI&M) FOR APPROXIMATELY $55

MILLION. TI&M IS THE PARENT COMPANY OF I&T INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY

ENTWICKLUNGSUND HOLDING AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT (I&T), AN AUSTRIAN MAKER OF FLAT

FLEXIBLE CABLE AND CIRCUITRY. PURSUANT TO A SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT, 3M MARKETED

THE FIRMS FLAT FLEXIBLE WIRING SYSTEMS FOR AUTOMOTIVE INTERIOR APPLICATIONS TO

THE GLOBAL AUTOMOTIVE MARKET. I&T FILED A PETITION FOR BANKRUPTCY

PROTECTION IN AUGUST 2006. AS PART OF ITS AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE THE SHARES

OF TI&M, THE COMPANY WAS GRANTED A PUT OPTION, WHICH GAVE THE COMPANY THE

RIGHT TO SELL BACK ITS ENTIRE OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN TI&M TO THE OTHER INVESTORS

FROM WHOM 3M ACQUIRED ITS 19 PERCENT INTEREST. THE PUT OPTION BECAME

EXERCISABLE JANUARY 1, 2007. THE COMPANY EXERCISED THE PUT OPTION AND

RECOVERED APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION OF ITS INVESTMENT FROM ONE OF THE INVESTORS

BASED IN BELGIUM IN FEBRUARY 2007. THE OTHER TWO TI&M INVESTORS HAVE

FILED A BANKRUPTCY PETITION IN AUSTRIA. THE COMPANY IS PURSUING RECOVERY OF THE

BALANCE OF

6 PERCENT IN LOCAL CURRENCY. FOREIGN EXCHANGE IMPACTS ADDED NEARLY 5 PERCENT TO

FOURTH QUARTER SALES. SALES INCREASED IN EVERY BUSINESS WITHIN HEALTH CARE,

MOST NOTABLY INFECTION PREVENTION, SKIN AND WOUND CARE AND HEALTH INFORMATION

SYSTEMS. THE ORTHODONTICS BUSINESS ALSO SHOWED A NICE REBOUND IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER. GEOGRAPHICALLY, SALES GREW IN ALL MAJOR AREAS LED BY CANADA, LATIN

AMERICA AND ASIA PACIFIC.

FOURTH-QUARTER

2009 OPERATING INCOME INCREASED TO $375 MILLION, OR 32.7 PERCENT OF SALES, WITH

OPERATING INCOME GROWTH DRIVEN BY FAVORABLE PRODUCT MIX, GOOD COST CONTROL AND

CONTINUED PRODUCTIVITY EFFORTS ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO. FOURTH QUARTER 2008

INCLUDES

CHARGES OF

$50 MILLION FOR RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT ACTIVITIES.

FOR

THE FULL YEAR, SALES WERE $4.3 BILLION, UP 3.6 PERCENT IN LOCAL CURRENCIES.

THIS GROWTH WAS BROAD-BASED, WITH POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS FROM NEARLY ALL

RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT ACTIVITIES.

INCLUDING THESE CHARGES,

FULL-YEAR OPERATING INCOME IN HEALTH CARE GREW 15 PERCENT TO $1.35 BILLION,

WITH OPERATING INCOME MARGINS OF 31.4 PERCENT IN 2009. 3MS LONGER-TERM PLAN IS

TO KEEP REINVESTING IN THIS BUSINESS TO DRIVE HIGHER GROWTH, EVEN IF OPERATING

INCOME MARGINS AT SOME POINT COMPRESS TO THE HIGH-20S.

IN

ADDITION, THE HEALTH CARE BUSINESS INVESTED IN A NUMBER OF AREAS TO DRIVE NEW

PRODUCTS, ACCELERATE GROWTH AND IMPROVE COMPETITIVENESS. FOR EXAMPLE, 3MS DRUG

DELIVERY SYSTEMS BUSINESS ENTERED THE LARGE AND GROWING DRY-POWDER INHALER

SEGMENT. IN WOUND CARE, 3M STRENGTHENED ITS MARKET LEADERSHIP IN CLEAR WOUND

DRESSINGS WITH NEW 3M



TEGADERM

CURRENCIES. A NUMBER OF BUSINESSES POSTED POSITIVE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH,

INCLUDING HOME CARE PRODUCTS, RETAIL HEALTH CARE, AND DO-IT-YOURSELF AND MASS

FUTURO, A LEADING SUPPLIER OF BRACES, SUPPORTS AND COMPRESSION HOSIERY. IN JULY 2009,

3M PURCHASED ACE PRODUCTS, ONE OF THE STRONG CONSUMER HEALTH CARE BRANDS, FROM

BECTON, DICKINSON. THESE INVESTMENTS, COMBINED WITH 3MS OWN SUCCESSFUL BRANDS,

PROVIDE CRITICAL MASS IN THE RETAIL DRUG STORE CHANNEL.

CONSUMER AND OFFICE HAS A

LONG AND SUCCESSFUL HISTORY OF GROWTH IN THE UNITED STATES VIA STRONG,

CATEGORY-DEFINING BRANDS AND AN EMPHASIS ON CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIPS. 3M IS

LEVERAGING THIS SUCCESS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AS WELL. FOURTH-QUARTER SALES

BY THE SLUMP IN U.S. CONSUMER RETAIL SPENDING LEVELS. MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF

SALES IN CONSUMER AND OFFICE ARE GENERATED WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. BY FAR THE

BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS DECLINE WAS THE

RETAIL AND WHOLESALE

OFFICE CHANNEL. THE COMBINATION OF MASSIVE OFFICE WORKER LAYOFFS, COUPLED WITH

ACROSS-THE-BOARD DECLINES IN OFFICE RETAIL FOOT TRAFFIC, HAD A DRAMATIC AND

NEGATIVE IMPACT ON SALES. 3M BUSINESSES SERVING OTHER U.S. RETAIL CHANNELS

PERFORMED WELL IN THE FOURTH QUARTER DESPITE THE TOUGH ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT.

THIS BUSINESS POSTED POSITIVE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES FOR ITS HOME CARE PRODUCTS,

SUCH AS SCOTCH-BRITE® SCRUB SPONGES, AND FOR ITS DO-IT-YOURSELF RETAIL CHANNEL.

ELSEWHERE AROUND THE GLOBE, 3MS CONSUMER AND OFFICE BUSINESS DROVE POSITIVE

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH IN BOTH LATIN AMERICA AND ASIA PACIFIC, BUT OVERALL

GROWTH WAS MUTED BY DECLINES IN EUROPE. WORLDWIDE OPERATING INCOME DECLINED IN

THE FOURTH QUARTER, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF $18 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING

CHARGES, WHICH CONTRIBUTED 11.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THIS 35.7 PERCENT DECLINE.

FOR TOTAL YEAR 2008,

CONSUMER AND OFFICE SALES GREW 2.4 PERCENT. THIS BUSINESS HAS SUCCESSFULLY

CREATED NEW PRODUCTS AND DESIGNED NEW PROGRAMS AND PLANOGRAMS WITH THEIR LARGE

U.S. CUSTOMERS IN ORDER TO MITIGATE WHAT IS A VERY TOUGH END-MARKET SITUATION.

SALES GROWTH WAS LED BY HOME CARE AND DO-IT-YOURSELF PRODUCTS. ACQUISITIONS,

PRIMARILY THE DO-IT-YOURSELF RETAIL MARKET PORTION OF 3MS AEARO BUSINESS,

CONTRIBUTED 1.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO SALES GROWTH. OPERATING INCOME DECLINED

3.8 PERCENT AND MARGINS WERE IN EXCESS OF 19 PERCENT, A STRONG RETURN

CONSIDERING THE SLOW U.S. MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND A SYNCHRONIZED SLOWDOWN IN

GROWTH ACROSS MOST OTHER AREAS OF THE WORLD. GEOGRAPHICALLY, SALES GROWTH WAS

LED BY ASIA PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA. OPERATING INCOME WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

BY THE $18 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING

PARAGRAPH.

RESPIRATORS APPROVED FOR USE IN DEFENDING AGAINST THE H1N1 VIRUS. SINCE THAT

TIME, DEMAND HAS CONTINUED TO EXCEED AVAILABLE SUPPLY. 3M RECENTLY APPROVED

RESPIRATOR CAPACITY INVESTMENTS IN BOTH SINGAPORE AND IN THE UNITED STATES.

ELSEWHERE WITHIN THIS

SEGMENT, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH WAS SLIGHTLY POSITIVE IN THE BUILDING AND

COMMERCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS, DRIVEN BY A NUMBER OF NEW PRODUCT INTRODUCTIONS,

BUT ALL OTHER BUSINESSES POSTED LOWER YEAR-ON-YEAR SALES. IN PARTICULAR, 3M SAW

MORE THAN 10 PERCENT LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES DECLINES IN ITS INDUSTRIAL-ORIENTED

CORROSION PROTECTION PRODUCTS BUSINESS, AND IN BUSINESSES LINKED CLOSELY TO

RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION, SUCH AS ROOFING GRANULES.

FOURTH-QUARTER OPERATING

INCOME INCREASED TO $201 MILLION, WITH OPERATING INCOME MARGINS AT 24.3

PERCENT. FOURTH QUARTER 2008 INCLUDED $12 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VARIOUS PATENTS AND

GROUPS OF PATENTS. THESE PATENTS PROVIDE VARYING LEVELS OF EXCLUSIVITY TO 3M

FOR A NUMBER OF SUCH PRODUCTS. AS SOME OF 3MS OPTICAL FILM PATENTS BEGIN TO

EXPIRE IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS, 3M WILL LIKELY SEE MORE COMPETITION IN THESE

PRODUCTS.  3M CONTINUES TO INNOVATE IN

THE AREA OF OPTICAL FILMS AND FILES PATENTS ON ITS NEW TECHNOLOGY AND PRODUCTS.

3MS PROPRIETARY MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY AND KNOW-HOW ALSO PROVIDE A

COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE TO 3M INDEPENDENT OF ITS PATENTS.

FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR 2009

RESULTS.

DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS

FOURTH QUARTER SALES INCREASED NEARLY 19 PERCENT TO $817 MILLION. SALES GREW

15.7 PERCENT IN LOCAL CURRENCIES, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE IMPACTS ADDED JUST OVER

3 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO THE FOURTH QUARTER GROWTH RATE. OPERATING INCOME

INCREASED TO $141 MILLION. OPERATING INCOME IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008

INCLUDED NET CHARGES OF $22 MILLION FOR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT

ACTIVITIES.

OPTICAL SYSTEMS CONTINUED

TO GROW IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, WITH SALES UP OVER 50 PERCENT YEAR-ON-YEAR.

INNOVATION WAS THE KEY DRIVER, AS 3M FILM TECHNOLOGY EFFECTIVELY IMPROVES THE

ENERGY EFFICIENCY OF AN LCD PANEL BY OVER 30 PERCENT AND CAN GREATLY SIMPLIFY

ITS DESIGN. SALES OF OPTICAL FILMS BEGAN TO ACCELERATE IN THE SECOND AND THIRD

QUARTER OF 2009, AND EVEN THOUGH FOURTH-QUARTER SALES DECLINED SEQUENTIALLY DUE

TO NORMAL SEASONAL REDUCTIONS, YEAR-ON-YEAR GROWTH RATES WERE STRONG. OPTICAL

WILL REMAIN INTENSELY COMPETITIVE GOING FORWARD. 3MS OEM CUSTOMERS CONTINUE TO

DRIVE PRICE REDUCTIONS, AND 3M WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO RESPOND WITH AGGRESSIVE

COST REDUCTION AND PRODUCTIVITY IN ORDER TO FUND NEW PRODUCTS.

FOURTH-QUARTER

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES WERE UP SLIGHTLY IN TRAFFIC SAFETY SYSTEMS, DRIVEN BY THE DECEMBER 2008

ACQUISITION OF A FINISHED LICENSE PLATE PROVIDER IN FRANCE. SALES IN THE

COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS BUSINESS WERE FLAT SEQUENTIALLY VERSUS THIRD-QUARTER AND

DECLINED YEAR-ON-YEAR AS ADVERTISING SPENDING REMAINS SOFT.

FOR THE FULL YEAR, SALES

IN DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS DECLINED 4 PERCENT TO $3.1 BILLION, AND OPERATING

INCOME INCREASED 1.3 PERCENT TO $590 MILLION. SALES GREW IN TRAFFIC SAFETY

SYSTEMS AND OPTICAL SYSTEMS, BUT DECLINED IN COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS AS THE GLOBAL

RECESSION SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWED SPENDING ON CORPORATE ADVERTISING. IN 2009,

OPERATING INCOME MARGINS WERE 18.8 PERCENT, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY 0.8

PERCENTAGE POINTS DUE TO NET RESTRUCTURING CHARGES OF $22 MILLION. THIS NET

AGGREGATE CHARGE INCLUDED FIXED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $13 MILLION AND

EMPLOYEE-RELATED SEVERANCE/BENEFITS/OTHER OF $9 MILLION, WHICH IS RECORDED NET

OF ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVIOUSLY RECORDED RESTRUCTURING CHARGES. IN 2008,

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND EXIT ACTIVITIES REDUCED OPERATING INCOME BY $42

MILLION.

DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS IS

WORKING AGGRESSIVELY TO ACCELERATE LONGER-TERM GROWTH POSSIBILITIES FOR THE

BUSINESS. FOR EXAMPLE, THIS SEGMENT FORMED A NEW ARCHITECTURAL MARKETS BUSINESS

TO FURTHER 3MS FOOTPRINT IN FILM SOLUTIONS FOR INTERIOR SURFACES AND FOR

ENERGY EFFICIENT LIGHTING SOLUTIONS. DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS ALSO FORMED A NEW

MOBILE INTERACTIVE SOLUTIONS BUSINESS TO DEVELOP PRODUCTS THAT IMPROVE

PROJECTION, PERSONALIZATION AND PRIVACY FOR MOBILE DEVICE USERS. IN ADDITION,

THIS SEGMENT ANNOUNCED A UNIQUE OPTICAL FILM THAT ENABLES 3D VIEWING ON

HANDHELD DEVICES WITHOUT THE NEED FOR 3D GLASSES. FINALLY, DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS

IS PREPARING TO LAUNCH THE THIRD IN A FAMILY OF POCKET PROJECTORS, THE 3M MPRO

150, WHICH PROJECTS HIGH-QUALITY IMAGES UP TO 50 INCHES.

FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR 2008

RESULTS.

RESULTS IN THIS BUSINESS

WERE AFFECTED BY END-MARKET CHALLENGES IN 3MS OPTICAL FILMS BUSINESS. DEMAND

FOR OPTICAL FILMS SLOWED CONSIDERABLY IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER OF

2008 AS TV, DESKTOP MONITOR AND NOTEBOOK PC MAKERS CANCELLED ORDERS FOR

LARGE-SIZE LCD PANELS DUE TO WEAK HOLIDAY SEASON SALES, REFLECTING THE GLOBAL

DOWNTURN IN BOTH CONSUMER AND CORPORATE DEMAND. FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER, 3M

POSTED SALES OF $687 MILLION IN DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS. SALES DECLINED 28

PERCENT, OR ABOUT 8 PERCENT EXCLUDING OPTICAL. TRAFFIC SAFETY SYSTEMS POSTED

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH OF NEARLY 3 PERCENT, AS HIGHWAY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS

AROUND THE WORLD GREW AT A MODEST RATE. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES DECLINED BY 6.2

PERCENT IN 3MS COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS BUSINESS AND BY 48 PERCENT IN OPTICAL

SYSTEMS. OPERATING INCOME IN THE FOURTH QUARTER DECLINED 80 PERCENT, WHICH

INCLUDED NET CHARGES OF $22 MILLION FOR RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT ACTIVITIES.

FOR THE FULL YEAR OF

2008, SALES DECLINED 16.6 PERCENT, DRIVING OPERATING INCOME DOWN 50 PERCENT TO

$583 MILLION. OPERATING MARGINS WERE AT 17.8 PERCENT FOR 2008. 3M TOOK

AGGRESSIVE ACTION DURING 2008 TO REDUCE ITS COST STRUCTURE ACROSS ALL

BUSINESSES WITHIN DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE OPTICAL

FILM BUSINESS. SECOND-HALF 2008 RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND EXIT ACTIVITIES OF

$42 MILLION REDUCED OPERATING INCOME FOR TOTAL YEAR 2008. THESE EXPENSES WERE

COMPRISED OF SEVERANCE/RELATED BENEFITS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS. IN 2007, 3M

RECORDED A GAIN ON THE SALE OF ITS OPTICOM PRIORITY CONTROL SYSTEMS AND CANOGA

TRAFFIC DETECTION BUSINESSES, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPENSES RELATED TO

RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT ACTIVITIES. THESE ITEMS ON A COMBINED BASIS BENEFITED

OPERATING INCOME BY $51 MILLION IN 2007. IN AGGREGATE, THESE ITEMS CONTRIBUTED

APPROXIMATELY 6 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THIS 50 PERCENT OPERATING INCOME DECLINE

WHEN COMPARING 2008 TO 2007. IN ADDITION, THE 2008 RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT

ACTIVITY CHARGES REDUCED 2008 OPERATING INCOME MARGINS BY 1.3 PERCENTAGE

POINTS, WHILE THE 2007 NET BENEFIT CONTRIBUTED 1.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE

29.8 PERCENT OPERATING INCOME MARGIN FOR 2007.

RESULTS.

THIS

BUSINESS SERVES A NUMBER OF END-MARKETS, THE MOST IMPORTANT BEING CONSUMER

ELECTRONICS AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS, ALONG WITH THE GLOBAL POWER UTILITY

INDUSTRY. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE WEAK HOLIDAY SEASON EXPERIENCED BY

THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS RETAILERS HAD A LARGE AND NEGATIVE IMPACT ON SALES IN

THIS BUSINESS. LIKEWISE THE GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR CONTINUED TO CUT

CAPITAL SPENDING ON NEW CAPACITY AND ON UPGRADES OF EXISTING EQUIPMENT. 3M HAD

A LARGE NUMBER OF EQUIPMENT ORDERS CANCELLED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008.

PERFORMANCE

BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA

WHILE

3M MANAGES ITS BUSINESSES GLOBALLY AND BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

ARE THE MOST RELEVANT MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES

GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA AS A SECONDARY PERFORMANCE MEASURE. EXPORT SALES ARE

GENERALLY REPORTED WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WHERE THE FINAL SALES TO 3M

CUSTOMERS ARE MADE. A PORTION OF THE PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS SOLD BY 3MS

OPERATIONS TO ITS CUSTOMERS ARE EXPORTED BY THESE CUSTOMERS TO DIFFERENT

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AS CUSTOMERS MOVE THEIR OPERATIONS FROM ONE GEOGRAPHIC AREA

TO ANOTHER, 3MS RESULTS WILL FOLLOW. THUS, NET SALES IN A PARTICULAR

GEOGRAPHIC AREA ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF END-USER CONSUMPTION IN THAT GEOGRAPHIC

AREA.

FINANCIAL

INFORMATION RELATED TO 3M OPERATIONS IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IS PROVIDED IN

NOTE 18. OPERATING INCOME RESULTS BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA WERE SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACTED BY RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS. IN 2009, RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GAIN ON SALES OF REAL ESTATE, DECREASED WORLDWIDE

OPERATING INCOME BY $194 MILLION, WITH THE LARGEST IMPACT IN EUROPE, ASIA

PACIFIC AND THE UNITED STATES. IN 2008, RESTRUCTURING

ACTIONS, EXIT

ACTIVITIES AND A LOSS ON SALE OF BUSINESSES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A

GAIN ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE,

DECREASED WORLDWIDE OPERATING INCOME BY $269

MILLION, WITH THE LARGEST IMPACT IN

THE UNITED STATES AND EUROPE.

IN 2007, THE GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND A GAIN ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE, NET

OF RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS, INCREASED WORLDWIDE OPERATING INCOME BY $681

MILLION, WITH THE LARGEST IMPACT IN EUROPE.

SHOWED SALES DECLINES; HOWEVER, YEAR-ON-YEAR SALES GROWTH IMPROVED EACH QUARTER

THROUGHOUT THE YEAR. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, SALES GROWTH OF 11.1

PERCENT WAS BROAD-BASED. EVERY MAJOR GEOGRAPHIC REGION EXPANDED SALES, WITH

STRONG PERFORMANCES IN ASIA PACIFIC AT 22 PERCENT AND LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA

EACH AT 19 PERCENT. WITH RESPECT TO ORGANIC VOLUME, ASIA PACIFIC LED THE WAY AT

NEARLY 19 PERCENT FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER. KOREA, CHINA AND TAIWAN POSTED THE

MOST SIGNIFICANT INCREASES, DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF IMPROVED LOCAL DEMAND

ALONG WITH THE PICKUP IN GLOBAL ELECTRONICS. ORGANIC VOLUMES WERE FLAT TO

SLIGHTLY DOWN IN OTHER GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, WHICH IS AN IMPROVEMENT VERSUS THE

LEVELS OF DECLINE SEEN IN THE FIRST THREE QUARTERS OF 2009. FOR 2009,

IN

2008, U.S. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 2.7 PERCENT, WITH ACQUISITIONS

CONTRIBUTING 5.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS. U.S. ORGANIC LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH

WAS LED BY HEALTH CARE. SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES AND INDUSTRIAL

AND TRANSPORTATION ALSO DROVE POSITIVE SALES GROWTH, HELPED BY ACQUISITIONS.

THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SOFTNESS IN THE ELECTRONIC SOLUTIONS BUSINESS AND

WEAKNESS IN A FEW BUSINESSES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THE SLOWDOWN IN THE U.S.

HOUSING, ROAD CONSTRUCTION AND MASS RETAIL MARKETS AND OFFICE SUPPLY

BUSINESSES. ASIA PACIFIC LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES DECLINED 5.9 PERCENT. THE

SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN OPTICAL SYSTEMS WITHIN DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS MORE THAN

OFFSET THE SALES GROWTH IN THE OTHER FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. SALES IN JAPAN

TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION, WITH LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES DOWN 5.2 PERCENT

FROM 2007. EUROPE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 2.8 PERCENT, HELPED BY

ACQUISITIONS, WITH GROWTH IN SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES, HEALTH

CARE, AND INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION. IN THE COMBINED LATIN AMERICA AND

CANADA AREA, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 12.8 PERCENT, WITH GROWTH IN ALL

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION POSITIVELY IMPACTED EUROPE

SALES BY 4.0 PERCENT, THE COMBINED LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA AREA SALES BY 2.4

EMPLOYMENT.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, EMPLOYMENT DECLINED BY 4,348 POSITIONS SINCE YEAR-END

2008, LARGELY DRIVEN BY RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS TAKEN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2008 THROUGH THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, EMPLOYMENT

INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 2,900 POSITIONS SINCE YEAR-END 2007, WITH

ACQUISITIONS DURING 2008 ADDING APPROXIMATELY 3,700 POSITIONS AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008. IN 2008, 3M ADDED EMPLOYEES IN BRAZIL, INDIA, RUSSIA, CHINA AND POLAND,

WHERE TOTAL SALES INCREASED MORE THAN 15 PERCENT. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET

BY REDUCTIONS IN EMPLOYMENT IN 2008 FOR A PORTION OF THE JOB ELIMINATIONS THAT

WERE ANNOUNCED IN CONNECTION WITH RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT ACTIVITIES.

CAPITAL SPENDING/NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

THE

BULK OF 3M CAPITAL SPENDING HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES,

RESULTING IN HIGHER NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT BALANCES IN THE UNITED

STATES. THE COMPANY IS STRIVING TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN ITS MANUFACTURING AND

SOURCING WITH GEOGRAPHIC MARKET SALES, AND BECAUSE APPROXIMATELY 63 PERCENT OF

SALES ARE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THIS WOULD INCREASE PRODUCTION OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES, HELPING TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND REDUCE WORKING CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS. THE DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE SUPPORT THIS TREND, AS

INTERNATIONAL CAPITAL SPENDING AS A PERCENT OF WORLDWIDE CAPITAL SPENDING

INCREASED FROM 41 PERCENT IN 2007 TO 49 PERCENT IN 2009. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES

WERE $903 MILLION IN 2009, COMPARED TO $1.471 BILLION IN 2008 AND $1.422

BILLION IN 2007. IN RESPONSE TO GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE COMPANY REDUCED

ITS CAPITAL SPENDING SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2009. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE 2009

SPENDING WAS CARRYOVER FROM 2008 OR FOR TOOLING NEEDED FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND

CONTINUED OPERATIONS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS 2010 CAPITAL SPENDING TO BE

APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION AS 3M CONTINUES TO FUND GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AROUND

THE WORLD.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

INFORMATION

REGARDING SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 1. AS STATED IN

NOTE 1, THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON

VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING

VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER

SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES ITS MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES RELATE TO LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS, THE COMPANYS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS AND INCOME TAXES. SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT,

SELECTION AND DISCLOSURE OF ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT

COMMITTEE OF 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS.

THE

CATEGORIES OF CLAIMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ESTIMATED ITS PROBABLE

LIABILITY, THE AMOUNT OF ITS LIABILITY ACCRUALS, AND THE ESTIMATES OF ITS

RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES ARE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES RELATED TO

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. PLEASE REFER TO THE SECTION ENTITLED ACCRUED LIABILITIES

AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTAINED IN LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS IN NOTE 14) FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH ESTIMATES.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

3M

HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S.

EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS

FOR ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE

INSURANCE BENEFIT PLANS IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING STANDARD CODIFICATION

(ASC) 715,

COMPENSATION  RETIREMENT

BENEFITS

,

IN MEASURING PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND IN DETERMINING THE

AMOUNT OF NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST. ASC 715 REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO RECOGNIZE

THE UNDERFUNDED OR OVERFUNDED STATUS OF A DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION OR

POSTRETIREMENT PLAN AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

POSITION AND RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FUNDED STATUS IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE

CHANGES OCCUR THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH IS A

COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

PENSION

BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANS ARE GENERALLY BASED PRIMARILY ON EACH

PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE, COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR

TERMINATION. TWO CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND LIABILITY

MEASUREMENT. THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE TREND RATE IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE ASSUMPTION. SEE NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL

DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES.

THE

COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE

DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLANS. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE

ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THE

COMPANY SETS ITS RATE TO REFLECT THE YIELD OF A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY,

FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD PRODUCE CASH FLOWS SUFFICIENT IN

TIMING AND AMOUNT TO SETTLE PROJECTED FUTURE BENEFITS. USING THIS METHODOLOGY,

THE COMPANY DETERMINED A DISCOUNT RATE OF 5.77% FOR U.S. PENSION AND 5.62% FOR

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT TO BE APPROPRIATE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WHICH IS A

DECREASE FROM THE 6.14% RATE USED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. FOR THE

INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS THE DISCOUNT RATES ALSO REFLECT

THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD BE EFFECTIVELY

SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE DISCOUNT RATE FOR

INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 WAS 5.30%, A DECREASE

FROM THE 5.53% RATE USED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

A

SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT IN DETERMINING THE COMPANYS PENSION EXPENSE IN ACCORDANCE

WITH ASC 715, IS THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, WHICH IS BASED ON

HISTORICAL RESULTS FOR SIMILAR ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S.

PENSION PLAN, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS FOR

2010 IS 8.50%, THE SAME AS 2009. REFER TO NOTE 11 FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THE

2010 RATE WAS DETERMINED. RETURN ON ASSETS ASSUMPTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL

PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE CALCULATED ON A

PLAN-BY-PLAN BASIS USING PLAN ASSET ALLOCATIONS AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN ASSUMPTIONS. THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED RETURN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL

PENSION PLAN IS 6.89% FOR 2010, COMPARABLE TO THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED

RETURN OF 6.86% FOR 2009.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED TOTAL CONSOLIDATED PRE-TAX PENSION EXPENSE (AFTER

SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS AND SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS) OF $176 MILLION, UP

FROM $89 MILLION IN 2008. PENSION EXPENSE (BEFORE SETTLEMENTS,

CURTAILMENTS AND SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS) IS ANTICIPATED TO INCREASE TO

APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION IN 2010. FOR THE PENSION PLANS, HOLDING ALL

OTHER FACTORS CONSTANT, AN INCREASE/DECREASE IN

33

TABLE OF

CONTENTS

THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS OF 0.25 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT WOULD

DECREASE/INCREASE 2010 PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $27 MILLION FOR

U.S. PENSION PLANS AND APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION FOR INTERNATIONAL PENSION

PLANS. ALSO, HOLDING ALL OTHER FACTORS CONSTANT, AN INCREASE/DECREASE IN THE

DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES OF 0.25 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT

WOULD DECREASE/INCREASE 2010 PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $33 MILLION FOR

U.S. PENSION PLANS AND APPROXIMATELY $17 MILLION FOR INTERNATIONAL PENSION

PLANS. SEE NOTE 11 FOR DETAILS OF THE IMPACT OF A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS.

AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT TOTALED $7.0

BILLION AND NET IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS TOTALED $1.3 BILLION. MANAGEMENT

MAKES ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR WHICH ACTUAL RESULTS WILL EMERGE OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THIS

INCLUDES THE RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EMPLOYED IN THE BUSINESS,

INCLUDING ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE

CLOSELY MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND PERIODICALLY ADJUSTED AS

CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. FOR INSTANCE,

EXPECTED ASSET LIVES MAY BE SHORTENED OR AN IMPAIRMENT RECORDED BASED ON A

CHANGE IN THE EXPECTED USE OF THE ASSET OR PERFORMANCE OF THE RELATED ASSET

GROUP. IMPAIRMENTS RECORDED IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007 RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING

ACTIONS AND OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4.

IN JUNE 2009, 3MS

SECURITY SYSTEMS DIVISION (WITHIN THE SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES

BUSINESS SEGMENT) WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE UK GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO AWARD THE

PRODUCTION OF ITS PASSPORTS TO A COMPETITOR UPON THE EXPIRATION OF 3MS

EXISTING UK PASSPORT CONTRACTS IN OCTOBER 2010. 3M REMAINS CONFIDENT IN

THE FUTURE OF ITS OVERALL PASSPORT BUSINESS, AND THE GROWTH PROSPECTS REMAIN

STRONG. 3M CONTINUES TO AGGRESSIVELY WORK TO WIN ADDITIONAL CONTRACTS IN OTHER

COUNTRIES. HOWEVER, AS A RESULT OF THIS EVENT, IN JUNE 2009, 3M TESTED THE

LONG LIVED ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UK PASSPORT ACTIVITY FOR RECOVERABILITY

AND ALSO REASSESSED THEIR REMAINING USEFUL LIVES. IN ADDITION, 3M TESTED

GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT (SECURITY SYSTEMS DIVISION)

LEVEL.

THE RESULT OF THE JUNE 2009

TEST OF RECOVERABILITY OF LONG LIVED ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UK PASSPORT

ACTIVITY INDICATED THAT THE ASSET GROUPINGS CARRYING AMOUNT OF APPROXIMATELY

$54 MILLION (BEFORE IMPAIRMENT) EXCEEDED THE REMAINING EXPECTED CASH FLOWS.

ACCORDINGLY, 3M RECORDED A NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $13

MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 TO WRITE THESE ASSETS DOWN TO THEIR FAIR

VALUE. IN ADDITION, ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION/AMORTIZATION IS BEING TAKEN OVER

THE PERIOD JUNE 2009 THROUGH THE DATE OF EXPIRATION OF THE CONTRACT BASED

ON A REASSESSMENT OF THE REMAINING EXPECTED USEFUL LIFE OF THESE ASSETS.

3M GOODWILL TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $5.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WHICH, BASED ON

IMPAIRMENT TESTING, IS NOT IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR GOODWILL IS DONE AT

A REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, WITH ALL GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO A REPORTING UNIT.

REPORTING UNITS ARE ONE LEVEL BELOW THE BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL (3M HAS SIX

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009), BUT CAN BE COMBINED WHEN

REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE SAME SEGMENT HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS.

AT 3M, REPORTING UNITS GENERALLY CORRESPOND TO A DIVISION. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, 3M DID NOT COMBINE ANY OF ITS REPORTING UNITS FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING.

AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS

GENERALLY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNITS

NET ASSETS EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED USING EARNINGS FOR THE

REPORTING UNIT MULTIPLIED BY A PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO FOR COMPARABLE INDUSTRY

GROUPS, OR BY USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. 3M TYPICALLY USES THE

PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO APPROACH FOR STABLE AND GROWING BUSINESSES THAT HAVE A

LONG HISTORY AND TRACK RECORD OF GENERATING POSITIVE OPERATING INCOME AND CASH

FLOWS. 3M USES THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW APPROACH FOR START-UP, LOSS POSITION

AND DECLINING BUSINESSES, BUT ALSO USES DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW AS AN ADDITIONAL

TOOL FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY BE GROWING AT A SLOWER RATE THAN PLANNED DUE TO

ECONOMIC OR OTHER CONDITIONS. 3M COMPLETES ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, 3M HAD 37 PRIMARY REPORTING UNITS, WITH EIGHT REPORTING UNITS ACCOUNTING

FOR APPROXIMATELY 75 PERCENT OF THE GOODWILL. THESE EIGHT REPORTING UNITS WERE

COMPRISED OF THE FOLLOWING DIVISIONS: 3M PURIFICATION INC., OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH

AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY, OPTICAL SYSTEMS, 3M ESPE, COMMUNICATION MARKETS,

INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES AND TAPES, SECURITY SYSTEMS, AND HEALTH INFORMATION

SYSTEMS.

THE FAIR VALUES FOR THE

MAJORITY OF REPORTING UNITS WERE IN EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE BY MORE THAN 30

PERCENT. THE FAIR VALUES FOR 3M PURIFICATION INC., OPTICAL SYSTEMS AND SECURITY

SYSTEMS, BASED ON FOURTH QUARTER 2009 TESTING, WERE IN EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE

BY APPROXIMATELY 15 PERCENT TO 30 PERCENT, WITH NO IMPAIRMENT INDICATED. AS

PART OF ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, 3M USED A

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS FOR ITS 3M PURIFICATION INC.,

OPTICAL SYSTEMS AND SECURITY SYSTEMS DIVISIONS, USING PROJECTED CASH FLOWS THAT

WERE WEIGHTED BASED ON DIFFERENT SALES GROWTH AND TERMINAL VALUE ASSUMPTIONS,

AMONG OTHER FACTORS. THE WEIGHTING WAS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES OF THE

LIKELIHOOD OF EACH SCENARIO OCCURRING.

34

TABLE OF

CONTENTS

IN 2009, FOR THOSE

REPORTING UNITS WHOSE FAIR VALUE WAS IN EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE BY MORE THAN

30 PERCENT, 3M PRIMARILY USED AN INDUSTRY PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO APPROACH, BUT

ALSO USED A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS APPROACH FOR CERTAIN REPORTING UNITS. IN

2008, 3M ADJUSTED THE STATED APPLICABLE INDUSTRY PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO DOWNWARD

FOR ITS ANNUAL TEST IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, UNLIKE PRIOR YEARS WHEN NO

ADJUSTMENT WAS REQUIRED. WITHOUT THIS ADJUSTMENT, THE ADDITION OF EACH

REPORTING UNITS ESTIMATED MARKET VALUES WOULD HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IN

EXCESS OF 3MS TOTAL COMPANY MARKET VALUE, WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN

UNUSUALLY HIGH IMPLIED CONTROL PREMIUM. THE CONTROL PREMIUM IS DEFINED AS THE

SUM OF THE INDIVIDUAL REPORTING UNITS ESTIMATED MARKET VALUES COMPARED TO 3MS

TOTAL COMPANY MARKET VALUE, WITH THE SUM OF THE INDIVIDUAL VALUES TYPICALLY

BEING LARGER THAN THE VALUE FOR THE TOTAL COMPANY. FOR EXAMPLE, AT YEAR-END

2008, 3MS MARKET VALUE WAS APPROXIMATELY $40 BILLION, BUT IF EACH REPORTING

UNIT WAS SOLD INDIVIDUALLY, 3MS VALUE WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $52 BILLION USING

A 30 PERCENT CONTROL PREMIUM. 3M FACTORED DOWN ITS PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO

SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE RESPECTIVE REPORTING UNITS TO APPROXIMATE WHAT THE

PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO WOULD BE AT A MORE NORMAL HISTORICAL CONTROL PREMIUM OF

APPROXIMATELY 30 PERCENT FOR THE TOTAL COMPANY. EVEN AFTER INCLUDING THIS

ADJUSTMENT TO THE PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO, NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS INDICATED

FOR ANY OF THE REPORTING UNITS IN 2008. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, 3MS

ESTIMATED CONTROL PREMIUM RANGED FROM 15 TO 30 PERCENT, WITH NO ADJUSTMENT

REQUIRED TO THE PRICE/EARNINGS RATIOS. BASED ON ITS ANNUAL TEST IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2009, NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS INDICATED FOR ANY OF THE REPORTING

UNITS. IN ADDITION, 3MS MARKET VALUE AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 OF

APPROXIMATELY $59 BILLION IS SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF ITS EQUITY OF

APPROXIMATELY $13 BILLION.

FACTORS WHICH COULD

RESULT IN FUTURE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, AMONG OTHERS, INCLUDE CHANGES IN WORLDWIDE

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHANGES IN COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMER

PREFERENCES, AND FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THESE RISK

FACTORS ARE DISCUSSED IN ITEM 1A, RISK FACTORS, OF THIS DOCUMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, 3M HAD APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION OF GOODWILL RELATED TO 3M PURIFICATION

INC., $800 MILLION RELATED TO OPTICAL SYSTEMS, AND $200 MILLION OF GOODWILL

ASSOCIATED WITH THE SECURITY SYSTEMS DIVISION. IF FUTURE NON-CASH IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES ARE TAKEN, 3M WOULD EXPECT THAT ONLY A PORTION OF THE LONG-LIVED ASSETS

OR GOODWILL WOULD BE IMPAIRED. 3M WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS REPORTING UNITS

IN 2010 FOR ANY TRIGGERING EVENTS OR OTHER INDICATORS OF IMPAIRMENT.

INCOME TAXES.

THE EXTENT OF 3MS

OPERATIONS INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN THE APPLICATION

OF COMPLEX TAX REGULATIONS IN A MULTITUDE OF JURISDICTIONS. THE FINAL TAXES

PAID ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS WITH TAXING

AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARISING FROM

FEDERAL, STATE, AND INTERNATIONAL TAX AUDITS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES POTENTIAL

LIABILITIES AND RECORDS TAX LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED TAX AUDIT ISSUES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS BASED ON ITS ESTIMATE OF WHETHER, AND

THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAXES WILL BE DUE. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007,

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY ASC 740,

INCOME TAXES

, REGARDING UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES, TO

RECORD THESE LIABILITIES (REFER TO NOTE 8 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION). THE

COMPANY ADJUSTS THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES;

HOWEVER, DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF SOME OF THESE UNCERTAINTIES, THE ULTIMATE

RESOLUTION MAY RESULT IN A PAYMENT THAT IS MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE

COMPANYS CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE TAX LIABILITIES. IF THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF

TAX LIABILITIES PROVES TO BE LESS THAN THE ULTIMATE ASSESSMENT, AN ADDITIONAL

CHARGE TO EXPENSE WOULD RESULT. IF PAYMENT OF THESE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY PROVES

TO BE LESS THAN THE RECORDED AMOUNTS, THE REVERSAL OF THE LIABILITIES WOULD

RESULT IN TAX BENEFITS BEING RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE COMPANY

DETERMINES THE LIABILITIES ARE NO LONGER NECESSARY.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

THE STRENGTH OF 3MS

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND CONSISTENCY OF ITS CASH FLOWS PROVIDE 3M RELIABLE ACCESS

TO CAPITAL MARKETS. AS INDICATED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, 3M HAD $4.6 BILLION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES

AND $5.710 BILLION OF DEBT. DEBT INCLUDED $5.097 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT,

$522 MILLION RELATED TO THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AND OTHER

BORROWINGS OF $91 MILLION. THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT INCLUDES $350

MILLION IN DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES, WHICH ULTIMATELY MATURE IN DECEMBER 2010.

WHILE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS REMAIN UNCERTAIN, 3M IS COMMITTED TO MANAGING ITS

CAPITAL STRUCTURE VERY CAREFULLY.

THE COMPANY GENERATES

SIGNIFICANT ONGOING CASH FLOW. A PORTION OF THE INCREASE IN DEBT AT YEAR-END

2008 WAS THE RESULT OF A STRATEGY TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN A CASH BUFFER IN THE

U.S. GIVEN THE DIFFICULT MARKET ENVIRONMENT AT THAT POINT IN TIME. INCREASES IN

LONG-TERM DEBT HAVE BEEN USED TO PARTIALLY FUND SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES AND

ACQUISITIONS. ON APRIL 1, 2008, 3M (SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION

SERVICES BUSINESS) COMPLETED ITS ACQUISITION OF 100 PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING

SHARES OF AEARO  A GLOBAL LEADER IN THE PERSONAL PROTECTION INDUSTRY THAT

MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS PERSONAL PROTECTION AND ENERGY ABSORBING PRODUCTS 

FOR APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION, INCLUSIVE OF DEBT ASSUMED, WHICH WAS

ANTICIPATED GROWTH PLANS, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING CAPITAL

INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT UTILIZE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS LINKED TO THE COMPANYS STOCK. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DOES

HAVE CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT THAT, IF CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET,

IS CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK (REFER TO NOTE 10 IN THIS

DOCUMENT).

THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY ARE STRONG. VARIOUS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, INCLUDING CASH AND SHORT-TERM DEBT, CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY

FROM MONTH TO MONTH DEPENDING ON SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS. WORKING CAPITAL

(DEFINED AS CURRENT ASSETS MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES) TOTALED $5.898 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009, COMPARED WITH $3.759 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

WORKING CAPITAL INCREASES WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASES IN CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, WHILE

DECREASES IN SHORT-TERM DEBT, ACCRUED INCOME TAXES AND OTHER CURRENT

LIABILITIES ALSO INCREASED WORKING CAPITAL. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

WORKING CAPITAL INCREASES ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND

ACCRUED PAYROLL, COMBINED WITH DECREASES IN INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS.

PRIMARY SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY

NEEDS ARE MET THROUGH U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER AND EURO COMMERCIAL PAPER

ISSUANCES.

THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM THAT ALLOWS 3M TO HAVE A MAXIMUM

OF $3 BILLION OUTSTANDING WITH A MAXIMUM MATURITY OF 397 DAYS FROM DATE OF

ISSUANCE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, 3M HAD NO OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER,

COMPARED TO $575 MILLION IN TOTAL COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31,

2008. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ITS ACCESS TO THE COMMERCIAL

PAPER MARKET WILL BE RESTRICTED. EFFECTIVE APRIL 30, 2007, THE COMPANY HAS

A $1.5-BILLION FIVE-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH HAS PROVISIONS FOR THE COMPANY

TO REQUEST AN INCREASE OF THE FACILITY UP TO $2 BILLION (AT THE LENDERS

DISCRETION), AND PROVIDING FOR UP TO $150 MILLION IN LETTERS OF CREDIT. AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, AVAILABLE SHORT-TERM COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT, INCLUDING THE PRECEDING

$1.5 BILLION FIVE-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY, TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1.593 BILLION,

OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $145 MILLION WAS UTILIZED FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT AND

OTHER SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS IN CONNECTION WITH NORMAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. DEBT

COVENANTS DO NOT RESTRICT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

THE

COMPANY HAS A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT,

EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 17, 2009, WHICH REGISTERS AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF

DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES FOR FUTURE SALES. NO SECURITIES HAVE BEEN ISSUED

UNDER THIS SHELF. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO USE THE PROCEEDS FROM FUTURE

SECURITIES SALES OFF THIS SHELF FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN CONNECTION

WITH A PRIOR WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER SHELF REGISTRATION, IN JUNE 2007

THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A $3 BILLION MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM. THREE DEBT

SECURITIES HAVE BEEN ISSUED UNDER THIS MEDIUM-TERM

THIRD, IN OCTOBER 2008, THE COMPANY ISSUED A THREE-YEAR $800 MILLION,

FIXED RATE NOTE WITH A COUPON RATE OF 4.50%. THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST

THE

COMPANY HAS AN AA- CREDIT RATING, WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK, FROM STANDARD &

POORS AND AN AA2 CREDIT RATING, WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK, FROM MOODYS INVESTORS

SERVICE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE

SECURITIES HAD RATINGS TRIGGERS (BBB-/BAA3 OR LOWER) THAT WOULD REQUIRE

REPAYMENT OF DEBT. IN ADDITION, UNDER THE $1.5-BILLION FIVE-YEAR CREDIT

FACILITY AGREEMENT, 3M IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ITS EBITDA TO INTEREST RATIO AS

OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER AT NOT LESS THAN 3.0 TO 1. THIS IS CALCULATED

(AS DEFINED IN THE AGREEMENT) AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL EBITDA FOR THE

FOUR CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS THEN ENDED TO TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE ON ALL FUNDED

DEBT FOR THE SAME PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THIS RATIO WAS

APPROXIMATELY 27 TO 1.

3MS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 TOTALED $3.040

SECURITIES. 3MS STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH

SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES GOING

FORWARD. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ITS OPERATIONS TO DRIVE GROWTH,

INCLUDING CONTINUAL REVIEW OF ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES. 3M PAID DIVIDENDS OF

$1.431 BILLION IN 2009, AND HAS A LONG HISTORY OF DIVIDEND INCREASES. IN FEBRUARY 2010,

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON 3M COMMON STOCK BY

2.9 PERCENT TO 52.5 CENTS PER SHARE, EQUIVALENT TO AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF $2.10

PER SHARE. IN FEBRUARY 2007, 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A TWO-YEAR

SHARE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $7.0 BILLION FOR THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 12,

2007 TO FEBRUARY 28, 2009. IN FEBRUARY 2009, 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

EXTENDED THIS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION UNTIL THE REMAINING AMOUNT IS

FULLY UTILIZED. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HAS $2.6 BILLION

REMAINING UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION.

IN

2010, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE IN CASH AN AMOUNT IN THE RANGE OF $500

MILLION TO $700 MILLION TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED MINIMUM PENSION CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR

ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2010. THEREFORE, THE AMOUNT OF THE ANTICIPATED DISCRETIONARY

CONTRIBUTION COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE U.S. QUALIFIED PLANS

FUNDED STATUS AS OF THE 2010 MEASUREMENT DATE AND THE ANTICIPATED TAX

DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE CONTRIBUTION. FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL ALSO DEPEND ON

MARKET CONDITIONS, INTEREST RATES AND OTHER FACTORS. 3M BELIEVES ITS STRONG

CASH FLOW AND BALANCE SHEET WILL ALLOW IT TO FUND FUTURE PENSION NEEDS WITHOUT

COMPROMISING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.

THE

COMPANY USES VARIOUS WORKING CAPITAL MEASURES THAT PLACE EMPHASIS AND FOCUS ON

CERTAIN WORKING CAPITAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THESE MEASURES ARE NOT DEFINED

UNDER U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND MAY NOT BE COMPUTED THE

SAME AS SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. ONE OF THE PRIMARY

WORKING CAPITAL MEASURES 3M USES IS A COMBINED INDEX, WHICH INCLUDES ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. THIS COMBINED INDEX (DEFINED AS

QUARTERLY NET SALES  FOURTH QUARTER AT YEAR-END  MULTIPLIED BY FOUR, DIVIDED

BY ENDING NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PLUS INVENTORY LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE) WAS 5.5

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, A SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT FROM 4.5 AT DECEMBER 31,

2008. RECEIVABLES INCREASED $55 MILLION, OR 1.7 PERCENT, COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31,

2008. CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BY $82 MILLION

YEAR-ON-YEAR, AS THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENED IN AGGREGATE AGAINST A MULTITUDE OF

CURRENCIES. INVENTORIES DECREASED $374 MILLION, OR 12.4 PERCENT, COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31,

2008. CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED INVENTORIES BY $71 MILLION YEAR-ON-YEAR.

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCREASED $152 MILLION COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31,

2008. CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BY $17 MILLION

YEAR-ON-YEAR.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING

ACTIVITIES CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, AS PENSION

FUNDING DECISIONS, TAX TIMING DIFFERENCES AND OTHER ITEMS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACT CASH FLOWS. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009, THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED $600

MILLION TO ITS U.S. DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN IN SHARES OF THE COMPANYS

COMMON STOCK, WHICH IS CONSIDERED A NON-CASH FINANCING ACTIVITY. THIS NON-CASH

ACTIVITY IS NOT REFLECTED IN THE OPERATING OR FINANCING SECTION OF THE CASH

FLOWS.

IN 2009, CASH FLOWS

PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $408 MILLION COMPARED TO 2008. THE

MAIN POSITIVE CONTRIBUTION TO OPERATING CASH FLOWS RELATED TO YEAR-ON-YEAR

WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS OF $771 MILLION (WHICH INCLUDES ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE, INVENTORIES AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE). IN ADDITION, LOWER CASH TAX

PAYMENTS IN 2009 BENEFITED CASH FLOWS. THESE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE OF $276 MILLION IN NET INCOME INCLUDING

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST. THE CATEGORY, OTHER-NET, IN THE PRECEDING TABLE

REFLECTS CHANGES IN OTHER ASSET AND LIABILITY ACCOUNTS. THIS INCLUDES THE

IMPACT OF CASH OUTLAYS FOR RESTRUCTURING PAYMENTS, NET OF RESTRUCTURING

EXPENSES, WHICH ON A COMBINED BASIS REDUCED LIABILITIES (NOTE 4). IN ADDITION,

DECREASES IN BANKED VACATION ACCRUALS REDUCED LIABILITIES.

IN 2008, CASH FLOWS

PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $287 MILLION. NET INCOME INCLUDING

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST DECREASED $631 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO GAINS FROM THE

SALE OF BUSINESSES IN 2007 WHICH DID NOT REPEAT IN 2008. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

DECREASES BENEFITED CASH FLOWS IN 2008, BUT INCREASES IN INVENTORIES AND

INVESTMENTS

IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ENABLE GROWTH IN DIVERSE MARKETS, HELPING TO

MEET PRODUCT DEMAND AND INCREASING MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY. IN RESPONSE TO

GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, THE COMPANY REDUCED ITS CAPITAL SPENDING

SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2009. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE 2009 SPENDING WAS CARRYOVER

FROM 2008 OR FOR TOOLING NEEDED FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND CONTINUED OPERATIONS. THE

COMPANY EXPECTS 2010 CAPITAL SPENDING TO BE APPROXIMATELY $1 BILLION AS 3M

CONTINUES TO FUND GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AROUND THE WORLD.

IN 2008, MAJOR FACILITY

EFFORTS INCLUDED COMPLETION OF PRODUCTION LINES IN THE UNITED STATES FOR BOTH

CONSUMER AND OFFICE AND HEALTH CARE, AN R&D LABORATORY IN KOREA, A TAPE

BUILDING IN POLAND, AND NUMEROUS TAPE LINES AND BUILDING EXPANSIONS IN CHINA.

IN 2008, 3M ALSO MADE PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION OF INVESTMENTS IN A SINGAPORE

MULTI-PURPOSE MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND FILM PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND MADE

PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION OF MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTION INVESTMENTS IN TWO

OF ITS U.S. FILM MANUFACTURING PLANTS.

IN 2007, NUMEROUS PLANTS

WERE OPENED OR EXPANDED INTERNATIONALLY. THIS INCLUDED TWO FACILITIES IN KOREA

(RESPIRATOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND OPTICAL PLANT), INDUSTRIAL

ADHESIVES/TAPES FACILITIES IN BOTH BRAZIL AND THE PHILIPPINES, A PLANT IN

RUSSIA (CORROSION PROTECTION, INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVE AND TAPES, AND RESPIRATORS),

A PLANT IN CHINA (OPTICAL SYSTEMS, INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES AND TAPES, AND PERSONAL

CARE), AN EXPANSION IN CANADA (CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT BUSINESS), IN

ADDITION TO INVESTMENTS IN INDIA, MEXICO AND OTHER COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, 3M

EXPANDED MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES IN THE U.S., INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN

INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES/TAPES AND OPTICAL.

REFER

TO NOTE 2 FOR INFORMATION ON ACQUISITIONS. NOTE 2 ALSO PROVIDES INFORMATION ON

THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY CONSIDERING

ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, AND FROM TIME TO

TIME MAY ALSO DIVEST CERTAIN BUSINESSES.

PURCHASES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS

AND PROCEEDS FROM SALE (OR MATURITIES) OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS

ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES,

AGENCY SECURITIES, CORPORATE MEDIUM-TERM NOTE SECURITIES AND OTHER SECURITIES, WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE.

INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL MAY

IMPACT THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS IN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, WHILE FACTORS SUCH

AS GENERAL CONDITIONS IN THE OVERALL CREDIT MARKET AND THE NATURE OF THE

UNDERLYING COLLATERAL MAY AFFECT THE LIQUIDITY OF INVESTMENTS IN ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES. THE COUPON INTEREST RATES FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ARE EITHER

FIXED RATE OR FLOATING. FLOATING RATE COUPONS RESET MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY

BASED UPON THE CORRESPONDING MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY LIBOR RATE. EACH

INDIVIDUAL FLOATING RATE SECURITY HAS A COUPON BASED UPON THE RESPECTIVE LIBOR

RATE +/- AN AMOUNT REFLECTIVE OF THE CREDIT RISK OF THE ISSUER AND THE

UNDERLYING COLLATERAL ON THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE. TERMS OF THE RESET ARE

UNIQUE TO INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES. FIXED RATE COUPONS ARE ESTABLISHED AT THE

TIME THE SECURITY IS ISSUED AND ARE BASED UPON A SPREAD TO A RELATED MATURITY

TREASURY BOND. THE SPREAD AGAINST THE TREASURY BOND IS REFLECTIVE OF THE

CREDIT RISK OF THE ISSUER AND THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL ON THE ORIGINAL ISSUE

DATE. 3M DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT RISK RELATED TO ITS HOLDINGS IN ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES TO MATERIALLY IMPACT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY. REFER TO

NOTE 9 FOR MORE DETAILS ABOUT 3MS DIVERSIFIED MARKETABLE SECURITIES

PORTFOLIO, WHICH TOTALED $1.569 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. IN 2005, 3M PURCHASED 19 PERCENT OF

TI&M BETEILIGUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH FOR APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION. IN 2008

AND 2007, THE RECOVERY OF APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION AND $25 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, REDUCED INVESTMENTS AND IS SHOWN IN CASH FLOWS WITHIN PROCEEDS

FROM SALE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS. THIS INVESTMENT IS

DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL UNDER THE PRECEDING SECTION ENTITLED INDUSTRIAL AND

TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS. ADDITIONAL PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS INCLUDE ADDITIONAL

SURVIVOR BENEFIT INSURANCE AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

TOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER 31

2009, WAS $5.7 BILLION, COMPARED TO $6.7 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2008 AND $4.9

BILLION AT YEAR-END 2007. AS DISCUSSED EARLIER, A PORTION OF THE INCREASE IN

DEBT AT YEAR-END 2008 WAS THE RESULT OF A STRATEGY TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN A CASH

BUFFER IN THE U.S. GIVEN THE DIFFICULT MARKET ENVIRONMENT AT THAT POINT IN

TIME. TOTAL DEBT WAS 30 PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL (TOTAL CAPITAL IS DEFINED AS

DEBT PLUS EQUITY), COMPARED WITH 39 PERCENT AT YEAR-END 2008 AND 29 PERCENT AT

YEAR-END 2007. THE NET CHANGE IN SHORT-TERM DEBT IS PRIMARILY DUE TO COMMERCIAL

PAPER ACTIVITY. IN 2009, REPAYMENT OF DEBT FOR MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS

INCLUDES A $400 MILLION MEDIUM-TERM NOTE THAT MATURED IN NOVEMBER 2009 AND

ALSO INCLUDES REPAYMENTS OF COMMERCIAL PAPER. IN 2008, THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT

FOR MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS PRIMARILY REPRESENTS DEBT ACQUIRED UPON THE

ACQUISITION OF AEARO THAT WAS IMMEDIATELY REPAID AND REPAYMENT OF COMMERCIAL

PAPER WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS. IN 2007, THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT FOR

MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS IS PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF COMMERCIAL PAPER

REPAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.15 BILLION AND THE NOVEMBER 2007 REDEMPTION

OF APPROXIMATELY $322 MILLION IN CONVERTIBLE NOTES. IN 2008, PROCEEDS FROM DEBT

PRIMARILY INCLUDE A FIVE-YEAR, $850 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE ISSUED IN AUGUST 2008

WITH A COUPON RATE OF 4.375%, AND A THREE-YEAR, $800 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE

ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2008 WITH A COUPON RATE OF 4.5% (REFER TO NOTE 10 FOR

MORE INFORMATION). IN 2007, PROCEEDS FROM DEBT INCLUDED LONG-TERM DEBT AND

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION.

REPURCHASES OF COMMON

STOCK ARE MADE TO SUPPORT THE COMPANYS STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS

AND FOR OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN FEBRUARY 2007, 3MS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A TWO-YEAR SHARE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $7.0 BILLION FOR THE

PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 12, 2007 TO FEBRUARY 28, 2009. IN 2009, THE

COMPANY HAD NO BROKER PURCHASES OF TREASURY STOCK. IN 2008, THE COMPANY

PURCHASED $1.6 BILLION IN SHARES. IN 2007, THE COMPANY ACCELERATED PURCHASES OF

TREASURY STOCK WHEN COMPARED TO PRIOR YEARS, BUYING BACK $3.2 BILLION IN

SHARES. IN FEBRUARY 2009, 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXTENDED THIS SHARE

REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION UNTIL THE REMAINING AMOUNT IS FULLY UTILIZED. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, APPROXIMATELY $2.6 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE. FOR MORE

INFORMATION, REFER TO THE TABLE TITLED ISSUER PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES

IN PART II, ITEM 5.

CASH DIVIDENDS PAID TO

SHAREHOLDERS TOTALED $1.431 BILLION ($2.04 PER SHARE), $1.398 BILLION ($2.00

PER SHARE) IN 2008 AND $1.380 BILLION ($1.92 PER SHARE) IN 2007. 3M HAS PAID

DIVIDENDS SINCE 1916. IN FEBRUARY 2010, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED

THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON 3M COMMON STOCK BY 2.9 PERCENT TO 52.5 CENTS PER

SHARE, EQUIVALENT TO AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF $2.10 PER SHARE. THIS MARKED THE

52ND CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF DIVIDEND INCREASES. OTHER CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING

ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE DISTRIBUTIONS TO NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS, EXCESS

TAX BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, CHANGES IN CASH OVERDRAFT BALANCES,

AND PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FOR CAPITAL LEASES.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY HAS NOT

HE COMPANYS $350 MILLION OF DEALER

REMARKETABLE SECURITIES (CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT) WERE

REMARKETED FOR ONE YEAR IN DECEMBER 2009. LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS DUE IN

2010 INCLUDE THESE $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES, WHICH MATURE

IN DECEMBER 2010, AND $146 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE NOTES. THE FLOATING

RATE NOTES ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS THE RESULT OF

PUT PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS

DUE IN 2011 INCLUDE FLOATING RATE NOTES TOTALING $100 MILLION AS A RESULT OF

PUT PROVISIONS. ADDITIONALLY, PAYMENTS DUE IN 2012 INCLUDE THE $225 MILLION

CARRYING AMOUNT OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES, AS A RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS THAT MAY OR

MAY NOT BE EXERCISED BY NOTE HOLDERS.

UNCONDITIONAL

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS ARE DEFINED AS AN AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES

THAT IS ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING ON THE COMPANY. INCLUDED IN THE

UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS CATEGORY ABOVE ARE CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS

RELATED TO TAKE OR PAY CONTRACTS, CAPITAL COMMITMENTS, SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND

UTILITIES. THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE BOTH UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH

TERMS IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR AND NORMAL ONGOING PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH TERMS

OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR. MANY OF THESE COMMITMENTS RELATE TO TAKE OR PAY

CONTRACTS, IN WHICH 3M GUARANTEES PAYMENT TO ENSURE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES THAT ARE SOLD TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE

CONSIDERATION (PRODUCTS OR SERVICES) FOR THESE UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS. CONTRACTUAL CAPITAL COMMITMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING

TABLE, BUT THESE COMMITMENTS REPRESENT A SMALL PART OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED

CAPITAL SPENDING IN 2010 AND BEYOND. THE PURCHASE OBLIGATION AMOUNTS DO NOT

REPRESENT THE ENTIRE ANTICIPATED PURCHASES IN THE FUTURE, BUT REPRESENT ONLY

THOSE ITEMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED. THE MAJORITY OF

3MS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PURCHASED AS NEEDED, WITH NO UNCONDITIONAL

COMMITMENT. FOR THIS REASON, THESE AMOUNTS WILL NOT PROVIDE A RELIABLE INDICATOR

OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH OUTFLOWS ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.

OTHER

OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WITHIN THE CAPTION ENTITLED UNCONDITIONAL

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER, INCLUDE THE CURRENT PORTION OF THE LIABILITY

FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS UNDER ASC 740. THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO

REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF THE LONG-TERM PAYMENTS OR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH

THE LIABILITY WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE OVER TIME; THEREFORE, THE LONG-TERM

PORTION OF THE NET TAX LIABILITY OF $330 MILLION IS EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING

TABLE. REFER TO NOTE 8 FOR FURTHER DETAILS.

AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED MINIMUM PENSION

CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2010 AND COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO

ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LARGELY

DISCRETIONARY IN 2010 AND FUTURE YEARS; THEREFORE, AMOUNTS RELATED TO THESE

PLANS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE.

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS

THE

COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL DERIVATIVE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE

OF BUSINESS TO MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE, INTEREST RATE RISKS AND COMMODITY

PRICE RISKS. A FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, COMPOSED OF SENIOR

MANAGEMENT, PROVIDES OVERSIGHT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES.

THIS COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RISK POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES,

AND PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT UTILIZATION. THIS COMMITTEE

ALSO ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES FOR CONTROL AND VALUATION, RISK ANALYSIS,

COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL, AND ONGOING MONITORING AND REPORTING.

THE

COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAPS TO

HEDGE AGAINST THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS

DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY MANAGES INTEREST RATE RISKS USING A MIX OF FIXED AND

FLOATING RATE DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE BORROWING COSTS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO

INTEREST RATE SWAPS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY AGREES TO EXCHANGE,

AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND FLOATING INTEREST

AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AN AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT.

THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS,

PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

A

MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO TEST THE COMPANYS EXPOSURE TO CHANGES

IN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES AND ASSESS THE RISK OF LOSS OR BENEFIT IN

AFTER-TAX EARNINGS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVES AND UNDERLYING

EXPOSURES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE MODEL (THIRD-PARTY BANK

DATASET) USED A 95 PERCENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL OVER A 12-MONTH TIME HORIZON. THE

MODEL USED ANALYZED 17 CURRENCIES, INTEREST RATES RELATED TO TWO CURRENCIES,

AND FIVE COMMODITIES, BUT DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT WHAT ACTUALLY WILL BE

EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY. THIS MODEL DOES NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN HEDGE

TRANSACTIONS, BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THEIR INCLUSION WOULD NOT MATERIALLY

IMPACT THE RESULTS. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK OF LOSS OR BENEFIT DECREASED IN

2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN VOLATILITY DURING 2009, WHICH IS ONE OF THE

KEY DRIVERS IN THE VALUATION MODEL. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE POSSIBLE

ADVERSE AND POSITIVE IMPACTS TO AFTER-TAX EARNINGS RELATED TO THESE EXPOSURES.

MANAGEMENTS

RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR THE INTEGRITY AND OBJECTIVITY OF THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS

REPORT. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WHERE

NECESSARY, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT ESTIMATES BASED ON MANAGEMENTS

JUDGMENT.

MANAGEMENT HAS ESTABLISHED

AND MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF INTERNAL ACCOUNTING AND OTHER CONTROLS FOR THE

COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THIS SYSTEM AND ITS ESTABLISHED ACCOUNTING

PROCEDURES AND RELATED CONTROLS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE

THAT ASSETS ARE SAFEGUARDED, THAT THE BOOKS AND RECORDS PROPERLY REFLECT ALL

TRANSACTIONS, THAT POLICIES AND PROCEDURES ARE IMPLEMENTED BY QUALIFIED

PERSONNEL, AND THAT PUBLISHED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE PROPERLY PREPARED AND

FAIRLY PRESENTED. THE COMPANYS SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL IS SUPPORTED BY

WIDELY COMMUNICATED WRITTEN POLICIES, INCLUDING BUSINESS CONDUCT POLICIES,

WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO REQUIRE ALL EMPLOYEES TO MAINTAIN HIGH ETHICAL STANDARDS

IN THE CONDUCT OF COMPANY AFFAIRS. INTERNAL AUDITORS CONTINUALLY REVIEW THE

ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL SYSTEM.

3M COMPANY

MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE

FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY

THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.

BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE.

THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009 HAS BEEN AUDITED BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED

PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN,

WHICH EXPRESSES AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

COMPANY

TABLE OF

CONTENTS

REPORT OF

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO

THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 3M COMPANY.

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN

THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX PRESENT

FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF 3M COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, AND THE

RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN

THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.  ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED,

IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL - INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO).  THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX.  OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON

THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).  THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS.  OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

INCLUDED EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND

DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL

FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION.  OUR

AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED OBTAINING AN

UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK

THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND

OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK.  OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH

OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT

OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH

IT ACCOUNTS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN 2007.  ALSO AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY RETROSPECTIVELY CHANGED THE

MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS FOR NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED

SUBSIDIARIES AND CERTAIN CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS IN 2009.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION

OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  A

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN

REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE

ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE

COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR

TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT

LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.  ALSO, PROJECTIONS

OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK

THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION.

3M IS A

DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL MANUFACTURER, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATOR AND MARKETER OF A WIDE

VARIETY OF PRODUCTS. ALL SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. ALL

SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERM 3M

OR COMPANY REFERS TO 3M COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES

OTHERWISE.

FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

LOCAL CURRENCIES GENERALLY ARE CONSIDERED

THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR

OPERATIONS IN LOCAL-CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS ARE TRANSLATED AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE

RATES. INCOME AND EXPENSE ITEMS ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE

PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR. CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED AS

A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY.

THE

COMPANY HAS A VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARY WITH NET SALES AND OPERATING INCOME

REPRESENTING LESS THAN ONE PERCENT OF 3MS RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENT AMOUNTS FOR 2009. REGULATIONS IN VENEZUELA REQUIRE THE PURCHASE AND

SALE OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TO BE MADE AT AN OFFICIAL RATE OF EXCHANGE THAT IS

FIXED FROM TIME TO TIME BY THE VENEZUELAN GOVERNMENT. CERTAIN LAWS IN THE

COUNTRY, HOWEVER, PROVIDE AN EXEMPTION FOR THE PURCHASE AND SALE OF CERTAIN

SECURITIES AND HAVE RESULTED IN AN INDIRECT PARALLEL MARKET THROUGH WHICH

COMPANIES MAY OBTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY WITHOUT HAVING TO PURCHASE IT FROM

VENEZUELAS COMMISSION FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE (CADIVI). THE

AVERAGE RATE OF EXCHANGE IN THE PARALLEL MARKET VARIES AND IS LESS FAVORABLE

THAN THE OFFICIAL RATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, 3M BEGAN USE OF THE

PARALLEL EXCHANGE RATE FOR TRANSLATION OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF ITS

VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARY. THIS CHANGE WAS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING

3MS ABILITY TO CONVERT CURRENCY IN THE PARALLEL MARKET, THE LIMITED RELEASE OF

FUNDS FROM CADIVI FOR THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS BY THE VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARY,

AND CONCLUSION THAT 3M WILL OR COULD USE THE PARALLEL MARKET FOR REPATRIATION

OF CAPITAL OR DIVIDENDS. THIS CHANGE RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT) OF APPROXIMATELY

$55 MILLION WITH A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN THE TRANSLATED ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES OF 3MS VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARY AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

ADDITIONALLY, 3M EVALUATES THE HIGHLY INFLATIONARY STATUS OF VENEZUELAS

ECONOMY BY CONSIDERING BOTH THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX (WHICH LARGELY IS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE CITIES OF CARACAS AND MARACAIBO) AND THE NATIONAL CONSUMER

PRICE INDEX (DEVELOPED COMMENCING IN 2008 AND COVERING THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OF

VENEZUELA). UNDER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS CODIFICATION (ASC) 830,

FOREIGN CURRENCY MATTERS

, THE REPORTING

CURRENCY OF A FOREIGN ENTITYS PARENT IS ASSUMED TO BE THAT ENTITYS FUNCTIONAL

CURRENCY WHEN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT OF A FOREIGN ENTITY IS HIGHLY

INFLATIONARY. GENERALLY, AN ECONOMY IS CONSIDERED HIGHLY INFLATIONARY WHEN ITS

CUMULATIVE INFLATION IS APPROXIMATELY 100 PERCENT OR MORE FOR THE THREE YEARS

THAT PRECEDE THE BEGINNING OF A REPORTING PERIOD. THE BLENDED CUMULATIVE

INFLATION RATE EXCEEDED 100 PERCENT IN NOVEMBER 2009. ACCORDINGLY, THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARY WILL BE REMEASURED AS IF ITS

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCY WERE THAT OF ITS PARENT BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010.

THIS REMEASUREMENT WILL DECREASE NET SALES OF THE VENEZUELAN SUBSIDIARY BY APPROXIMATELY

TWO-THIRDS IN 2010 IN COMPARISON TO 2009 (BASED ON EXCHANGE RATES AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009), BUT WILL NOT OTHERWISE HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OPERATING INCOME AND 3MS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RECLASSIFICATIONS.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN THE PRIOR YEARS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

USE OF

ESTIMATES.

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT

TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE

DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND

EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE

ESTIMATES.

SUBSEQUENT

EVENTS.

3M HAS EVALUATED SUBSEQUENT EVENTS THROUGH THE DATE THAT THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS WERE ISSUED, WHICH WAS FEBRUARY 16, 2010, THE DATE OF 3MS

ANNUAL REPORT ON 10-K FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009.

CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH

AND TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS WHEN

PURCHASED.

INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS

PRIMARILY INCLUDE EQUITY AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS AND REAL ESTATE NOT USED

IN THE BUSINESS. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE.

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (LOSS) IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

TABLE OF

CONTENTS

OTHER

ASSETS.

OTHER ASSETS INCLUDE DEFERRED INCOME TAXES, PRODUCT

AND OTHER INSURANCE RECEIVABLES, THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE

POLICIES, AND OTHER LONG-TERM ASSETS. INVESTMENTS IN LIFE INSURANCE ARE

REPORTED AT THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE REALIZED UNDER CONTRACT AT THE BALANCE

SHEET DATE, WITH ANY CHANGES IN CASH SURRENDER VALUE OR CONTRACT VALUE DURING

THE PERIOD ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ADJUSTMENT OF PREMIUMS PAID. CASH OUTFLOWS AND

INFLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH LIFE INSURANCE ACTIVITY ARE INCLUDED IN PURCHASES OF

MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS AND PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF MARKETABLE

SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS, RESPECTIVELY.

INVENTORIES.

INVENTORIES

ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, WITH COST GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A

FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS.

PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING

CAPITALIZED INTEREST AND INTERNAL ENGINEERING COSTS, ARE RECORDED AT COST.

DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT GENERALLY IS COMPUTED USING THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD BASED ON THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS PRIMARILY RANGE FROM 10 TO

40 YEARS, WITH THE MAJORITY IN THE RANGE OF 20 TO 40 YEARS. THE ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT PRIMARILY RANGE FROM THREE TO 15 YEARS,

WITH THE MAJORITY IN THE RANGE OF FIVE TO 10 YEARS. FULLY DEPRECIATED ASSETS

ARE RETAINED IN PROPERTY AND ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTS UNTIL DISPOSAL.

UPON DISPOSAL, ASSETS AND RELATED ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE

ACCOUNTS AND THE NET AMOUNT, LESS PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSAL, IS CHARGED OR

CREDITED TO OPERATIONS. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AMOUNTS ARE REVIEWED FOR

IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET (ASSET GROUP) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN IMPAIRMENT

LOSS WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE

ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE

ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE

RECORDED IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUE OVER ITS

FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

ANALYSIS.

CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

A LIABILITY IS

INITIALLY RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED

WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT IS

INCURRED IF A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE CAN BE MADE. CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS EXIST FOR CERTAIN LONG-TERM ASSETS OF THE COMPANY. THE

OBLIGATION IS INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE USING EXPECTED PRESENT VALUE

TECHNIQUES. OVER TIME THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR

PRESENT VALUE AND THE INITIAL CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE

REMAINING USEFUL LIVES OF THE RELATED ASSETS. THE ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION

LIABILITY WAS $64 MILLION AND $62 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AT DECEMBER 31,

2009 AND 2008.

GOODWILL.

GOODWILL IS THE EXCESS OF COST OF AN ACQUIRED ENTITY OVER

THE AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A BUSINESS

COMBINATION. GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT

ANNUALLY, AND IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS

OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY BE

IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR GOODWILL IS DONE AT A REPORTING UNIT LEVEL,

WITH ALL GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO A REPORTING UNIT. REPORTING UNITS ARE ONE LEVEL

BELOW THE BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL, BUT CAN BE COMBINED WHEN REPORTING UNITS

WITHIN THE SAME SEGMENT HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. AN IMPAIRMENT

LOSS GENERALLY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING

UNITS NET ASSETS EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED USING EARNINGS FOR THE

REPORTING UNIT MULTIPLIED BY A PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO FOR COMPARABLE INDUSTRY

GROUPS, OR BY USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. THE PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO

IS ADJUSTED, IF NECESSARY, TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE MARKET VALUE OF THE

COMPANY.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDE

PATENTS, TRADENAMES AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM AN INDEPENDENT

PARTY. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE, NAMELY CERTAIN TRADENAMES,

ARE NOT AMORTIZED. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE ARE AMORTIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, WITH ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM ONE TO 20 YEARS.

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, AND ARE

TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY BE IMPAIRED. INTANGIBLE

ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET (ASSET GROUP) MAY

NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT

OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USED IN DETERMINING

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECORDED

IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUE OVER ITS FAIR VALUE.

FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. COSTS

RELATED TO INTERNALLY DEVELOPED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS PATENTS, ARE

EXPENSED AS INCURRED, PRIMARILY IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

REVENUE (SALES) RECOGNITION.

THE COMPANY SELLS A WIDE

RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSIFIED BASE OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD AND HAS

NO MATERIAL CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP HAVE SUBSTANTIVELY

TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS. THIS CONDITION NORMALLY IS MET WHEN THE PRODUCT HAS

BEEN DELIVERED OR UPON PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES. THE COMPANY RECORDS

ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE OR RECORDS

EXPENSE

FOR CUSTOMER AND DISTRIBUTOR INCENTIVES, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF REBATES AND

FREE GOODS, AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THESE SALES INCENTIVES ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 605,

REVENUE

RECOGNITION

. THE ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS OF REVENUE FOR REBATES ARE

BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TREND ANALYSIS AND PROJECTED

MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS SERVED. SINCE THE COMPANY SERVES

NUMEROUS MARKETS, THE REBATE PROGRAMS OFFERED VARY ACROSS BUSINESSES, BUT THE

MOST COMMON INCENTIVE RELATES TO AMOUNTS PAID OR CREDITED TO CUSTOMERS FOR

ACHIEVING DEFINED VOLUME LEVELS OR GROWTH OBJECTIVES. FREE GOODS ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS AN EXPENSE AND RECORDED IN COST OF SALES. SALES, USE, VALUE-ADDED AND

OTHER EXCISE TAXES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN REVENUE.

THE

MAJORITY OF 3MS SALES AGREEMENTS ARE FOR STANDARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH

CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OCCURRING UPON DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCT OR PERFORMANCE OF

THE SERVICE. 3M ALSO ENTERS INTO AGREEMENTS THAT CONTAIN MULTIPLE ELEMENTS

(SUCH AS EQUIPMENT, INSTALLATION AND SERVICE) OR NON-STANDARD TERMS AND

CONDITIONS. FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, 3M RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR

DELIVERED ELEMENTS WHEN IT HAS STAND-ALONE VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER, THE FAIR

VALUES OF UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS ARE KNOWN, CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF THE DELIVERED

ELEMENTS HAS OCCURRED, AND THERE ARE ONLY CUSTOMARY REFUND OR RETURN RIGHTS

RELATED TO THE DELIVERED ELEMENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE PRECEDING CONDITIONS,

EQUIPMENT REVENUE IS NOT RECORDED UNTIL THE INSTALLATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED IF

EQUIPMENT ACCEPTANCE IS DEPENDENT UPON INSTALLATION, OR IF INSTALLATION IS

ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE EQUIPMENT. INSTALLATION REVENUES ARE NOT

RECORDED UNTIL INSTALLATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED. FOR PREPAID SERVICE CONTRACTS,

SALES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE

CONTRACT, UNLESS HISTORICAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THE COSTS ARE INCURRED ON OTHER

THAN A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. LICENSE FEE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EARNED, AND NO

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED UNTIL THE INCEPTION OF THE LICENSE TERM. ON OCCASION,

AGREEMENTS WILL CONTAIN MILESTONES, OR 3M WILL RECOGNIZE REVENUE BASED ON

PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE. FOR THESE AGREEMENTS, AND DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFICS,

3M MAY RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON COMPLETION OF A SUBSTANTIVE MILESTONE, OR IN

PROPORTION TO COSTS INCURRED TO DATE COMPARED WITH THE ESTIMATE OF TOTAL COSTS

TO BE INCURRED.

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCES.

TRADE ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE ARE RECORDED AT THE INVOICED AMOUNT AND DO NOT BEAR INTEREST. THE

COMPANY MAINTAINS ALLOWANCES FOR BAD DEBTS, CASH DISCOUNTS, PRODUCT RETURNS AND

VARIOUS OTHER ITEMS. THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND PRODUCT RETURNS IS

BASED ON THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES IN EXISTING

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ANTICIPATED SALES RETURNS. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE

ALLOWANCES BASED ON HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE BY INDUSTRY AND REGIONAL

ECONOMIC DATA AND HISTORICAL SALES RETURNS. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE ALLOWANCE

FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS MONTHLY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

ADVERTISING

AND MERCHANDISING.

THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS IN THE YEAR

INCURRED, AND TOTALED $414 MILLION IN 2009, $468 MILLION IN 2008 AND $469

MILLION IN 2007.

RESEARCH,

DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO

OPERATIONS IN THE YEAR INCURRED AND ARE SHOWN ON A SEPARATE LINE OF THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES

TOTALED $1.293 BILLION IN 2009, $1.404 BILLION IN 2008 AND $1.368 BILLION IN

2007. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, COVERING BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND

THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND IMPROVED

PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, TOTALED $838 MILLION IN 2009, $851 MILLION IN 2008 AND

$788 MILLION IN 2007. RELATED EXPENSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT

PROVIDED BY 3M TO CUSTOMERS WHO ARE USING EXISTING 3M PRODUCTS; INTERNALLY

DEVELOPED PATENT COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE COSTS AND FEES INCURRED TO PREPARE, FILE,

SECURE AND MAINTAIN PATENTS; AND AMORTIZATION OF ACQUIRED PATENTS.

INTERNAL-USE

SOFTWARE.

THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES DIRECT COSTS OF MATERIALS

AND SERVICES USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE. AMOUNTS

CAPITALIZED ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A PERIOD OF THREE TO

SEVEN YEARS AND ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT WITHIN

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

ENVIRONMENTAL.

ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXISTING CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO

NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE REVENUES ARE EXPENSED. RESERVES FOR

LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED ON AN UNDISCOUNTED

BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN

THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF

ACTION. ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO

CURRENT OR FUTURE OPERATIONS GENERALLY ARE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER

THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.

INCOME

TAXES.

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND

LIABILITY APPROACH. UNDER THIS APPROACH, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES REPRESENT THE

EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING

AMOUNTS AND TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY RECORDS A

VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN UNCERTAINTY

REGARDING THEIR REALIZABILITY EXISTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, NO

SIGNIFICANT VALUATION ALLOWANCES WERE RECORDED. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007, THE

COMPANY ADOPTED NEW STANDARDS RELATED TO

ACCOUNTING

FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES. 3M FOLLOWS THIS GUIDANCE TO RECORD

UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN THE APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX REGULATIONS IN A

MULTITUDE OF JURISDICTIONS (REFER TO NOTE 8 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION).

EARNINGS PER SHARE.

THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE 3M SHARES

OUTSTANDING FOR CALCULATING BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE

TO 3M COMMON SHAREHOLDERS IS THE RESULT OF THE DILUTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANYS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. CERTAIN OPTIONS OUTSTANDING UNDER

THESE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS DURING THE YEARS 2009, 2008 AND 2007 WERE

NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO

3M COMMON SHAREHOLDERS BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A DILUTIVE EFFECT (54.3

MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR 2009, 41.0 MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR 2008, AND

21.6 MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR 2007). AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 10, THE CONDITIONS

FOR CONVERSION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES HAVE NEVER BEEN MET.

IF THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, 3M MAY CHOOSE TO PAY IN CASH AND/OR

COMMON STOCK; HOWEVER, IF THIS OCCURS, THE COMPANY HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY

TO SETTLE THIS DEBT SECURITY IN CASH. ACCORDINGLY, THERE WAS NO IMPACT ON

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M COMMON SHAREHOLDERS. THE COMPUTATIONS FOR BASIC AND DILUTED

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR BOTH

ITS GENERAL EMPLOYEES STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (GESPP) AND THE LONG-TERM INCENTIVE

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS DETERMINED AT THE GRANT DATE AND THE RECOGNITION OF

THE RELATED EXPENSE IS RECORDED OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION VESTS. REFER TO NOTE 16 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME.

TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND THE COMPONENTS OF ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

CHANGES IN EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (LOSS) IS COMPOSED OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EFFECTS (INCLUDING

HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES), DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

AND POSTRETIREMENT PLAN ADJUSTMENTS, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

ON CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

DERIVATIVES

AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE

OF ASC 815,

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

,

ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE

SWAPS, CURRENCY AND COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND

OPTION CONTRACTS TO MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE

RATE, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY MARKET VOLATILITY. ALL HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

THAT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. IF THE

UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION CEASES TO EXIST, ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE

RELATED DERIVATIVES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT

EARNINGS. INSTRUMENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE MARKED TO

MARKET WITH CHANGES RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD

OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND IS NOT A

PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DOES HAVE CONTINGENTLY

CONVERTIBLE DEBT THAT, IF CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, IS CONVERTIBLE

INTO SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK (REFER TO NOTE 10 IN THIS DOCUMENT).

NEW

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JUNE 2009, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED A STANDARD THAT ESTABLISHED THE FASB ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS CODIFICATION

 (ASC) AND

AMENDED THE HIERARCHY OF GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) SUCH

THAT THE ASC BECAME THE SINGLE SOURCE OF AUTHORITATIVE NONGOVERNMENTAL U.S.

GAAP. THE ASC DID NOT CHANGE CURRENT U.S. GAAP, BUT WAS INTENDED TO SIMPLIFY

USER ACCESS TO ALL AUTHORITATIVE U.S. GAAP BY PROVIDING ALL

55

TABLE OF

CONTENTS

THE AUTHORITATIVE LITERATURE RELATED TO A PARTICULAR

TOPIC IN ONE PLACE. ALL PREVIOUSLY EXISTING ACCOUNTING STANDARD DOCUMENTS WERE

SUPERSEDED AND ALL OTHER ACCOUNTING LITERATURE NOT INCLUDED IN THE ASC IS

CONSIDERED NON-AUTHORITATIVE. NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARDS ISSUED SUBSEQUENT TO JUNE 30,

2009 ARE COMMUNICATED BY THE FASB THROUGH ACCOUNTING STANDARDS UPDATES (ASUS).

FOR 3M, THE ASC WAS EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2009. THIS STANDARD DID NOT HAVE AN

IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

HOWEVER, THROUGHOUT THE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

REFERENCES THAT WERE PREVIOUSLY MADE TO VARIOUS FORMER AUTHORITATIVE U.S. GAAP

PRONOUNCEMENTS HAVE BEEN CHANGED TO COINCIDE WITH THE APPROPRIATE SECTION OF

THE ASC.

IN

JUNE 2006, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING STANDARD CODIFIED IN ASC 740,

INCOME TAXES

, RELATED TO ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN

INCOME TAXES. THIS STANDARD WAS ADOPTED BY 3M EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007.

REFER TO NOTE 8 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS STANDARD.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED AN

ACCOUNTING STANDARD CODIFIED IN ASC 820,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

AND DISCLOSURES

. THIS STANDARD ESTABLISHED A SINGLE DEFINITION OF

FAIR VALUE AND A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, SET OUT A FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY TO BE USED TO CLASSIFY THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION USED IN FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS, AND REQUIRED DISCLOSURES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT

FAIR VALUE BASED ON THEIR LEVEL IN THE HIERARCHY. THIS STANDARD APPLIES UNDER

OTHER ACCOUNTING STANDARDS THAT REQUIRE OR PERMIT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. 3M

ADOPTED THE STANDARD AS AMENDED BY SUBSEQUENT FASB STANDARDS BEGINNING JANUARY 1,

2008 ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. ONE OF THE AMENDMENTS DEFERRED THE EFFECTIVE DATE

FOR ONE YEAR RELATIVE TO NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED

AT FAIR VALUE, BUT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING

BASIS. THIS DEFERRAL APPLIED TO SUCH ITEMS AS NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION (BUT NOT

MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS) OR NONFINANCIAL LONG-LIVED ASSET

GROUPS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE FOR AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT. THESE REMAINING

ASPECTS OF THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT STANDARD WERE ADOPTED BY THE COMPANY PROSPECTIVELY

BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. REFER TO NOTE 13 FOR

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR

VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS AS A RESULT OF THIS ADOPTION.

IN

FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING STANDARD CODIFIED IN ASC 825,

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

, THAT PERMITS AN

ENTITY TO CHOOSE, AT SPECIFIED ELECTION DATES, TO MEASURE ELIGIBLE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS AT FAIR VALUE THAT WERE NOT CURRENTLY

REQUIRED TO BE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. AN ENTITY REPORTS UNREALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES ON ITEMS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED IN EARNINGS AT

EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING DATE. UPFRONT COSTS AND FEES RELATED TO ITEMS FOR

WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION IS ELECTED ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS INCURRED

AND NOT DEFERRED. THIS STANDARD ALSO ESTABLISHED PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE COMPARISONS BETWEEN ENTITIES THAT CHOOSE

DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES FOR SIMILAR TYPES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

THIS STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS

BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007 (JANUARY 1, 2008 FOR 3M) AND

INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. AT THE EFFECTIVE DATE, AN ENTITY

COULD ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR ELIGIBLE ITEMS THAT EXISTED AT THAT DATE.

THE ENTITY WAS REQUIRED TO REPORT THE EFFECT OF THE FIRST REMEASUREMENT TO FAIR

VALUE AS A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED

EARNINGS. THE COMPANY DID NOT ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR ELIGIBLE ITEMS

THAT EXISTED AS OF JANUARY 1, 2008.

IN

JUNE 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED A STANDARD REGARDING THE ACCOUNTING FOR

NONREFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS OR SERVICES TO BE USED IN FUTURE

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT REQUIRES NONREFUNDABLE ADVANCE

PAYMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY FOR FUTURE R&D ACTIVITIES TO BE CAPITALIZED

AND RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE AS THE GOODS OR SERVICES ARE RECEIVED BY THE COMPANY.

THIS STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M WITH RESPECT TO NEW ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED

INTO BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2008 AND DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED AND, IN APRIL 2009,

AMENDED A NEW BUSINESS COMBINATIONS STANDARD CODIFIED WITHIN ASC 805, WHICH

CHANGED THE ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS. ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS UNDER THIS STANDARD REQUIRES THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN A BUSINESS

COMBINATION TO RECOGNIZE ALL (AND ONLY) THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES

ASSUMED IN THE TRANSACTION AND ESTABLISHES THE ACQUISITION-DATE FAIR VALUE AS

THE MEASUREMENT OBJECTIVE FOR ALL ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A

BUSINESS COMBINATION. CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THIS STANDARD IMPACT THE

DETERMINATION OF ACQUISITION-DATE FAIR VALUE OF CONSIDERATION PAID IN A

BUSINESS COMBINATION (INCLUDING CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION); EXCLUDE TRANSACTION

COSTS FROM ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING; AND CHANGE ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR ACQUISITION-RELATED

RESTRUCTURING COSTS, IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, INDEMNIFICATION

ASSETS, AND TAX BENEFITS. FOR 3M, THIS STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE FOR BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS TO AN ACQUIRED ENTITYS DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND

LIABILITY BALANCES OCCURRING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2008. THIS STANDARD HAD NO

IMMEDIATE IMPACT UPON ADOPTION BY 3M, AND WAS APPLIED TO THE BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 2 THAT WERE COMPLETED POST-2008 AND TO

APPLICABLE ADJUSTMENTS TO ACQUIRED ENTITY DEFERRED TAX ITEMS OCCURRING AFTER DECEMBER 31,

2008.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW

STANDARD WHICH ESTABLISHED THE ACCOUNTING FOR AND REPORTING OF NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS (NCIS) IN PARTIALLY OWNED CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES AND THE LOSS OF

CONTROL OF SUBSIDIARIES. CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THIS STANDARD INDICATE, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, THAT NCIS (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS MINORITY INTERESTS) BE

TREATED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF EQUITY, NOT AS A LIABILITY (AS WAS

PREVIOUSLY THE CASE); THAT INCREASES AND DECREASES IN THE PARENTS OWNERSHIP

INTEREST THAT LEAVE CONTROL INTACT BE TREATED AS EQUITY TRANSACTIONS, RATHER

THAN AS STEP ACQUISITIONS OR GAINS OR LOSSES ON PURCHASES OR SALES; AND THAT

LOSSES OF A PARTIALLY OWNED CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY BE ALLOCATED TO THE NCI

EVEN WHEN SUCH ALLOCATION MIGHT RESULT IN A DEFICIT BALANCE. THIS STANDARD ALSO

REQUIRED CHANGES TO CERTAIN PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. FOR 3M,

THE STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009. THE PROVISIONS OF

THE STANDARD WERE APPLIED TO ALL NCIS PROSPECTIVELY, EXCEPT FOR THE

PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WERE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO

ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. AS A RESULT, UPON ADOPTION, 3M RETROACTIVELY

RECLASSIFIED THE MINORITY INTEREST IN SUBSIDIARIES BALANCE PREVIOUSLY

INCLUDED IN THE OTHER LIABILITIES SECTION OF THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET

TO A NEW COMPONENT OF EQUITY WITH RESPECT TO NCIS IN CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES.

THE ADOPTION ALSO IMPACTED CERTAIN CAPTIONS PREVIOUSLY USED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME, LARGELY IDENTIFYING NET INCOME INCLUDING NCI AND NET

INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M. ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY THIS STANDARD ARE

ALSO INCLUDED IN NOTE 6. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB RATIFIED A STANDARD

RELATED TO ACCOUNTING FOR COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS WHICH DISCUSSES HOW

PARTIES TO A COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT (WHICH DOES NOT ESTABLISH A LEGAL ENTITY

WITHIN SUCH ARRANGEMENT) SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR VARIOUS ACTIVITIES. THE STANDARD

INDICATES THAT COSTS INCURRED AND REVENUES GENERATED FROM TRANSACTIONS WITH

THIRD PARTIES (I.E. PARTIES OUTSIDE OF THE COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT) SHOULD BE

REPORTED BY THE COLLABORATORS ON THE RESPECTIVE LINE ITEMS IN THEIR INCOME

STATEMENTS PURSUANT TO ASC 605-45,

PRINCIPLE AGENT

CONSIDERATIONS

. ADDITIONALLY, THE GUIDANCE PROVIDES THAT INCOME

STATEMENT CHARACTERIZATION OF PAYMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTICIPANTS IN A

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT SHOULD BE BASED UPON EXISTING AUTHORITATIVE

STANDARDS; ANALOGY TO SUCH STANDARDS IF NOT WITHIN THEIR SCOPE; OR A

REASONABLE, RATIONAL, AND CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION. THIS

GUIDANCE WAS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND APPLIED

RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED FOR COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS

EXISTING AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD DID NOT HAVE

A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

IN MARCH 2008, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING

STANDARD RELATED TO DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, CODIFIED IN ASC 815, WHICH REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT AN

ENTITYS STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES FOR USING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS; THE

LOCATION AND AMOUNTS OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS; HOW DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED HEDGED ITEMS ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR UNDER ASC 815, AND HOW DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED HEDGED ITEMS

AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL POSITION, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND CASH FLOWS. CERTAIN

DISCLOSURES ARE ALSO REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO DERIVATIVE FEATURES THAT ARE CREDIT-RISK-RELATED.

THE STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 ON A

PROSPECTIVE BASIS. THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY THIS STANDARD ARE

INCLUDED IN NOTE 12.

IN

APRIL 2008, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING STANDARD WHICH AMENDED THE LIST

OF FACTORS AN ENTITY SHOULD CONSIDER IN DEVELOPING RENEWAL OR EXTENSION

ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING THE USEFUL LIFE OF RECOGNIZED INTANGIBLE ASSETS

UNDER ASC 350,

INTANGIBLES - GOODWILL AND OTHER.

THIS NEW STANDARD APPLIES TO (1) INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE ACQUIRED

INDIVIDUALLY OR WITH A GROUP OF OTHER ASSETS AND (2) INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ACQUIRED IN BOTH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS. UNDER THIS

STANDARD, ENTITIES ESTIMATING THE USEFUL LIFE OF A RECOGNIZED INTANGIBLE ASSET

MUST CONSIDER THEIR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE IN RENEWING OR EXTENDING SIMILAR

ARRANGEMENTS OR, IN THE ABSENCE OF HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, MUST CONSIDER

ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE ABOUT RENEWAL OR EXTENSION. FOR

3M, THIS STANDARD REQUIRED CERTAIN ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES BEGINNING JANUARY 1,

2009 (WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN NOTES 2 AND 3) AND APPLICATION TO USEFUL LIFE

ESTIMATES PROSPECTIVELY FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AFTER DECEMBER 31,

2008. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN MAY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING

STANDARD WHICH ADDRESSES CONVERTIBLE DEBT SECURITIES THAT, UPON CONVERSION BY

THE HOLDER, MAY BE SETTLED BY THE ISSUER FULLY OR PARTIALLY IN CASH (RATHER THAN

SETTLED FULLY IN SHARES) AND SPECIFIES THAT ISSUERS OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS SHOULD

SEPARATELY ACCOUNT FOR THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS IN A MANNER THAT

REFLECTS THE ISSUERS NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT BORROWING RATE WHEN RELATED INTEREST

COST IS RECOGNIZED. THIS STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M BEGINNING JANUARY 1,

2009 WITH RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. THIS STANDARD

IMPACTED THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES (REFER TO NOTE 10  TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR

MORE DETAIL), AND REQUIRED THAT ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE ESSENTIALLY

EQUIVALENT TO THE PORTION OF ISSUANCE PROCEEDS BE RETROACTIVELY ALLOCATED TO

THE INSTRUMENTS EQUITY COMPONENT AND BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD FROM THE

CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUANCE ON NOVEMBER 15, 2002 THROUGH NOVEMBER 15,

2005 (THE FIRST DATE HOLDERS OF THESE NOTES HAD THE ABILITY TO PUT THEM BACK TO

3M). 3M ADOPTED THIS STANDARD IN JANUARY 2009. ITS RETROSPECTIVE

APPLICATION HAD NO IMPACT ON RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR PERIODS FOLLOWING 2005,

BUT ON POST-2005 CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS, IT

CONTENTS

RESULTED IN AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $22 MILLION

IN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED OPENING ADDITIONAL PAID IN CAPITAL AND A CORRESPONDING

DECREASE IN PREVIOUSLY REPORTED OPENING RETAINED EARNINGS.

IN

EARLY OCTOBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING STANDARD CODIFIED IN ASC

820,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES

,

WHICH ILLUSTRATED KEY CONSIDERATIONS IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A

FINANCIAL ASSET IN AN INACTIVE MARKET. THIS STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M

BEGINNING WITH THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2008. ITS ADDITIONAL

GUIDANCE WAS INCORPORATED IN THE MEASUREMENTS OF FAIR VALUE OF APPLICABLE

FINANCIAL ASSETS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 13 AND DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FASB RATIFIED A STANDARD RELATED TO CERTAIN

EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENT ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS. THE STANDARD INDICATES,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT TRANSACTION COSTS FOR AN INVESTMENT SHOULD BE INCLUDED

IN THE COST OF THE EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENT (AND NOT EXPENSED) AND SHARES

SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED BY THE EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEE THAT REDUCE THE INVESTORS

OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS IF THE INVESTOR HAD SOLD A

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ITS INVESTMENT, WITH GAINS OR LOSSES RECORDED THROUGH

EARNINGS. FOR 3M, THE STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE FOR TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING AFTER DECEMBER 31,

2008. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FASB RATIFIED AN ACCOUNTING STANDARD RELATED

TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION OR ASSET ACQUISITION

THAT AN ENTITY DOES NOT INTEND TO USE OR INTENDS TO HOLD TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM

OBTAINING ACCESS (A DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSET). UNDER THE STANDARD A DEFENSIVE

INTANGIBLE ASSET NEEDS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING AND

WOULD BE ASSIGNED A USEFUL LIFE BASED ON THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE ASSET

DIMINISHES IN VALUE. FOR 3M, THE STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE FOR TRANSACTIONS

OCCURRING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE COMPANY CONSIDERED THIS STANDARD IN

TERMS OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS OR ASSET

ACQUISITIONS THAT CLOSED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2008.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING

STANDARD REGARDING A COMPANYS DISCLOSURES ABOUT POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN

ASSETS. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT PLAN ASSETS FOR

SPONSORS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS INCLUDING EXPANDED

INFORMATION REGARDING INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, MAJOR CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS,

AND CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK WITHIN PLAN ASSETS. ADDITIONALLY, THIS STANDARD

REQUIRES DISCLOSURES SIMILAR TO THOSE REQUIRED FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND

DISCLOSURES UNDER ASC 820 WITH RESPECT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS SUCH AS

THE INPUTS AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE AND INFORMATION

WITH RESPECT TO CLASSIFICATION OF PLAN ASSETS IN TERMS OF THE HIERARCHY OF THE

SOURCE OF INFORMATION USED TO DETERMINE THEIR VALUE. FOR 3M, THE DISCLOSURES

UNDER THIS STANDARD ARE REQUIRED BEGINNING WITH THE ANNUAL PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2009. THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ARE INCLUDED IN NOTE 11.

IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING

STANDARD WHICH PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON (1) ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF AN

ASSET OR LIABILITY WHEN THE VOLUME AND LEVEL OF ACTIVITY FOR THE ASSET OR

LIABILITY HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY DECLINED AND (2) IDENTIFYING TRANSACTIONS

THAT ARE NOT ORDERLY. THE STANDARD ALSO AMENDED CERTAIN DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS

FOR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS AND DISCLOSURES IN ASC 820 TO REQUIRE, AMONG OTHER

THINGS, DISCLOSURES IN INTERIM PERIODS OF THE INPUTS AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES

USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE AS WELL AS DISCLOSURE OF THE HIERARCHY OF THE SOURCE

OF UNDERLYING FAIR VALUE INFORMATION ON A DISAGGREGATED BASIS BY SPECIFIC MAJOR

CATEGORY OF INVESTMENT. FOR 3M, THIS STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY

BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

IN APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING

STANDARD WHICH MODIFIES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR RECOGNIZING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY

IMPAIRED DEBT SECURITIES AND CHANGES THE EXISTING IMPAIRMENT MODEL FOR SUCH

SECURITIES. THE STANDARD ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR BOTH ANNUAL

AND INTERIM PERIODS WITH RESPECT TO BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES. UNDER THE

STANDARD, IMPAIRMENT OF DEBT SECURITIES IS CONSIDERED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IF

AN ENTITY (1) INTENDS TO SELL THE SECURITY, (2) MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERING ITS COST, OR (3) DOES

NOT EXPECT TO RECOVER THE SECURITYS ENTIRE AMORTIZED COST BASIS (EVEN IF THE

ENTITY DOES NOT INTEND TO SELL). THE STANDARD FURTHER INDICATES THAT, DEPENDING

ON WHICH OF THE ABOVE FACTOR(S) CAUSES THE IMPAIRMENT TO BE CONSIDERED

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, (1) THE ENTIRE SHORTFALL OF THE SECURITYS FAIR

VALUE VERSUS ITS AMORTIZED COST BASIS OR (2) ONLY THE CREDIT LOSS PORTION

WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHILE THE REMAINING SHORTFALL (IF ANY) WOULD BE

RECORDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE STANDARD REQUIRES ENTITIES TO

INITIALLY APPLY ITS PROVISIONS TO PREVIOUSLY OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED

DEBT SECURITIES EXISTING AS OF THE DATE OF INITIAL ADOPTION BY MAKING A

CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS IN THE

PERIOD OF ADOPTION. THE CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT POTENTIALLY RECLASSIFIES

THE NONCREDIT PORTION OF A PREVIOUSLY OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED DEBT

SECURITY HELD AS OF THE DATE OF INITIAL ADOPTION FROM RETAINED EARNINGS TO

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. FOR 3M, THIS STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE

BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION. ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY THIS STANDARD ARE INCLUDED IN

NOTE 9.

TABLE OF

CONTENTS

IN

APRIL 2009, THE FASB ISSUED AN ACCOUNTING STANDARD REGARDING INTERIM

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE STANDARD ESSENTIALLY

EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURE ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT WERE

PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED ONLY ANNUALLY TO ALSO BE REQUIRED FOR INTERIM PERIOD

REPORTING. IN ADDITION, THE STANDARD REQUIRES CERTAIN ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES

REGARDING THE METHODS AND SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR

VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M BEGINNING APRIL 1,

2009 ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS. THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY THIS

STANDARD ARE INCLUDED IN NOTE 13.

IN

MAY 2009, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD REGARDING SUBSEQUENT

EVENTS. THIS STANDARD INCORPORATES INTO AUTHORITATIVE ACCOUNTING LITERATURE

CERTAIN GUIDANCE THAT ALREADY EXISTED WITHIN GENERALLY ACCEPTED AUDITING

STANDARDS, WITH THE REQUIREMENTS CONCERNING RECOGNITION AND DISCLOSURE OF

SUBSEQUENT EVENTS REMAINING ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED. THIS GUIDANCE ADDRESSES

EVENTS WHICH OCCUR AFTER THE BALANCE SHEET DATE BUT BEFORE THE ISSUANCE OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. UNDER THE NEW STANDARD, AS UNDER PREVIOUS PRACTICE, AN

ENTITY MUST RECORD THE EFFECTS OF SUBSEQUENT EVENTS THAT PROVIDE EVIDENCE ABOUT

CONDITIONS THAT EXISTED AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE AND MUST DISCLOSE BUT NOT

RECORD THE EFFECTS OF SUBSEQUENT EVENTS WHICH PROVIDE EVIDENCE ABOUT CONDITIONS

THAT DID NOT EXIST AT THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. THIS STANDARD ADDED AN ADDITIONAL

REQUIRED DISCLOSURE RELATIVE TO THE DATE THROUGH WHICH SUBSEQUENT EVENTS HAVE

BEEN EVALUATED AND WHETHER THAT IS THE DATE ON WHICH THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

WERE ISSUED. FOR 3M, THIS STANDARD WAS EFFECTIVE BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2009.

THE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY THIS STANDARD ARE INCLUDED IN NOTE 1.

IN

JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED A NEW STANDARD REGARDING THE ACCOUNTING FOR

TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AMENDING THE EXISTING GUIDANCE ON TRANSFERS OF

FINANCIAL ASSETS TO, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ELIMINATE THE QUALIFYING

SPECIAL-PURPOSE ENTITY CONCEPT, INCLUDE A NEW UNIT OF ACCOUNT DEFINITION THAT

MUST BE MET FOR TRANSFERS OF PORTIONS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR

SALE ACCOUNTING, CLARIFY AND CHANGE THE DERECOGNITION CRITERIA FOR A TRANSFER

TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SALE, AND REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURE.

FOR 3M, THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE FOR NEW TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS

BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010. BECAUSE 3M HISTORICALLY DOES NOT HAVE

SIGNIFICANT TRANSFERS OF FINANCIAL ASSETS, THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD IS NOT

EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN JUNE 2009, THE

FASB ISSUED A NEW STANDARD THAT REVISES THE CONSOLIDATION GUIDANCE FOR

VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITIES. THE MODIFICATIONS INCLUDE THE ELIMINATION OF THE

EXEMPTION FOR QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES, A NEW APPROACH FOR

DETERMINING WHO SHOULD CONSOLIDATE A VARIABLE-INTEREST ENTITY, AND CHANGES TO

WHEN IT IS NECESSARY TO REASSESS WHO SHOULD CONSOLIDATE A VARIABLE-INTEREST

ENTITY. FOR 3M, THIS STANDARD IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT EXPECT THE ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN

AUGUST 2009, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2009-05,

MEASURING

LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE

, WHICH PROVIDES ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE ON HOW

COMPANIES SHOULD MEASURE LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE UNDER ASC 820. THE ASU

CLARIFIES THAT THE QUOTED PRICE FOR AN IDENTICAL LIABILITY SHOULD BE USED.

HOWEVER, IF SUCH INFORMATION IS NOT AVAILABLE, A ENTITY MAY USE THE QUOTED

PRICE OF AN IDENTICAL LIABILITY WHEN TRADED AS AN ASSET, QUOTED PRICES FOR

SIMILAR LIABILITIES OR SIMILAR LIABILITIES TRADED AS ASSETS, OR ANOTHER

VALUATION TECHNIQUE (SUCH AS THE MARKET OR INCOME APPROACH). THE ASU ALSO

INDICATES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY IS NOT ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE

IMPACT OF CONTRACTUAL RESTRICTIONS THAT PREVENT ITS TRANSFER AND INDICATES

CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH QUOTED PRICES FOR AN IDENTICAL LIABILITY OR QUOTED PRICE

FOR AN IDENTICAL LIABILITY TRADED AS AN ASSET MAY BE CONSIDERED LEVEL 1 FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS (SEE NOTE 13 FOR A DESCRIPTION OF LEVEL 1 MEASUREMENTS). FOR

3M, THIS ASU WAS EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS ASU DID

NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN SEPTEMBER 2009, THE

FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2009-12,

INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN

ENTITIES THAT CALCULATE NET ASSET VALUE PER SHARE (OR ITS EQUIVALENT)

,

THAT AMENDS ASC 820 TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON MEASURING THE FAIR VALUE OF CERTAIN

ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS SUCH AS HEDGE FUNDS, PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS AND VENTURE

CAPITAL FUNDS. THE ASU INDICATES THAT, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, THE FAIR

VALUE OF SUCH INVESTMENTS MAY BE DETERMINED USING NET ASSET VALUE (NAV) AS A

PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT, UNLESS IT IS PROBABLE THE INVESTMENT WILL BE SOLD AT

SOMETHING OTHER THAN NAV. IN THOSE SITUATIONS, THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT CANNOT

BE USED AND DISCLOSURE OF THE REMAINING ACTIONS NECESSARY TO COMPLETE THE SALE

IS REQUIRED. THE ASU ALSO REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES OF THE ATTRIBUTES OF

ALL INVESTMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE NEW GUIDANCE, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER AN

ENTITY USED THE PRACTICAL EXPEDIENT TO MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF ANY OF ITS

INVESTMENTS.

THE

DISCLOSURE PROVISIONS OF THIS ASU ARE NOT APPLICABLE TO AN EMPLOYERS

DISCLOSURES ABOUT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS. 3M DOES

NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT DIRECT INVESTMENTS

WITHIN

THE SCOPE OF ASU NO. 2009-12, BUT CERTAIN PLAN ASSETS OF THE COMPANYS

BENEFIT PLANS ARE VALUED BASED ON NAV AS INDICATED IN NOTE 11. FOR 3M, THIS ASU

WAS EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 1, 2009. THE ADOPTION OF THIS ASU DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE

FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2009-13,

MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTSA CONSENSUS OF THE FASB EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE

,

THAT PROVIDES AMENDMENTS TO THE CRITERIA FOR SEPARATING CONSIDERATION IN

MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE ARRANGEMENTS. AS A RESULT OF THESE AMENDMENTS, MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WILL

BE SEPARATED IN

MORE CIRCUMSTANCES THAN UNDER EXISTING U.S. GAAP. THE ASU DOES THIS BY

ESTABLISHING A SELLING PRICE HIERARCHY FOR DETERMINING THE SELLING PRICE OF A

DELIVERABLE. THE SELLING PRICE USED FOR EACH DELIVERABLE WILL BE BASED ON

VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE IF AVAILABLE, THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE IF

VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE IS NOT AVAILABLE, OR ESTIMATED SELLING PRICE

IF NEITHER VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE NOR THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE IS AVAILABLE.

A VENDOR WILL BE REQUIRED TO DETERMINE ITS BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE IN A

MANNER THAT IS CONSISTENT WITH THAT USED TO DETERMINE THE PRICE TO SELL THE

DELIVERABLE ON A STANDALONE BASIS. THIS ASU ALSO ELIMINATES THE RESIDUAL METHOD

OF ALLOCATION AND WILL REQUIRE THAT ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION BE ALLOCATED AT

THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT TO ALL DELIVERABLES USING THE RELATIVE SELLING

PRICE METHOD, WHICH ALLOCATES ANY DISCOUNT IN THE OVERALL ARRANGEMENT

PROPORTIONALLY TO EACH DELIVERABLE BASED ON ITS RELATIVE SELLING PRICE.

EXPANDED DISCLOSURES OF QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION REGARDING

APPLICATION OF THE MULTIPLE-DELIVERABLE REVENUE ARRANGEMENT GUIDANCE ARE ALSO

REQUIRED UNDER THE ASU. THE ASU DOES NOT APPLY TO ARRANGEMENTS FOR WHICH INDUSTRY

SPECIFIC ALLOCATION AND MEASUREMENT GUIDANCE EXISTS, SUCH AS LONG-TERM

CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS AND SOFTWARE TRANSACTIONS. FOR 3M, ASU NO. 2009-13

IS EFFECTIVE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2011. 3M MAY ELECT TO ADOPT THE

PROVISIONS PROSPECTIVELY TO NEW OR MATERIALLY MODIFIED ARRANGEMENTS BEGINNING

ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OR RETROSPECTIVELY FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. THE COMPANY

IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS STANDARD ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN

OCTOBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2009-14,

CERTAIN

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE SOFTWARE ELEMENTSA CONSENSUS OF THE FASB

EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE

, THAT REDUCES THE TYPES OF TRANSACTIONS

THAT FALL WITHIN THE CURRENT SCOPE OF SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE.

EXISTING SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT ITS PROVISIONS BE

APPLIED TO AN ENTIRE ARRANGEMENT WHEN THE SALE OF ANY PRODUCTS OR SERVICES

CONTAINING OR UTILIZING SOFTWARE WHEN THE SOFTWARE IS CONSIDERED MORE THAN

INCIDENTAL TO THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE. AS A RESULT OF THE AMENDMENTS INCLUDED IN

ASU NO. 2009-14, MANY TANGIBLE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT RELY ON SOFTWARE

WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS REVENUE

RECOGNITION GUIDANCE RATHER THAN UNDER THE SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION

GUIDANCE. UNDER THE ASU, THE FOLLOWING COMPONENTS WOULD BE EXCLUDED FROM THE

SCOPE OF SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE.

THE TANGIBLE ELEMENT OF THE PRODUCT, SOFTWARE PRODUCTS BUNDLED WITH TANGIBLE

PRODUCTS WHERE THE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS AND NON-SOFTWARE COMPONENTS FUNCTION

TOGETHER TO DELIVER THE PRODUCTS ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONALITY, AND UNDELIVERED

COMPONENTS THAT RELATE TO SOFTWARE THAT IS ESSENTIAL TO THE TANGIBLE PRODUCTS

FUNCTIONALITY. THE ASU ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW TO ALLOCATE TRANSACTION

CONSIDERATION WHEN AN ARRANGEMENT CONTAINS BOTH DELIVERABLES WITHIN THE SCOPE

OF SOFTWARE REVENUE GUIDANCE (SOFTWARE DELIVERABLES) AND DELIVERABLES NOT

WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THAT GUIDANCE (NON-SOFTWARE DELIVERABLES). FOR 3M, ASU NO. 2009-14

IS EFFECTIVE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2011. 3M MAY ELECT TO ADOPT THE

PROVISIONS PROSPECTIVELY TO NEW OR MATERIALLY MODIFIED ARRANGEMENTS BEGINNING

ON THE EFFECTIVE DATE OR RETROSPECTIVELY FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. HOWEVER, 3M

MUST ELECT THE SAME TRANSITION METHOD FOR THIS GUIDANCE AS THAT CHOSEN FOR ASU NO. 2009-13.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT OF THIS STANDARD ON 3MS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN

JANUARY 2010, THE FASB ISSUED ASU NO. 2010-6,

IMPROVING

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

, THAT AMENDS EXISTING

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS UNDER ASC 820 BY ADDING REQUIRED DISCLOSURES ABOUT

ITEMS TRANSFERRING INTO AND OUT OF LEVELS 1 AND 2 IN THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY;

ADDING SEPARATE DISCLOSURES ABOUT PURCHASE, SALES, ISSUANCES, AND SETTLEMENTS

RELATIVE TO LEVEL 3 MEASUREMENTS; AND CLARIFYING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE

EXISTING FAIR VALUE DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE LEVEL OF DISAGGREGATION. FOR 3M THIS

ASU IS EFFECTIVE FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, EXCEPT FOR THE REQUIREMENT TO

PROVIDE LEVEL 3 ACTIVITY OF PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCES, AND SETTLEMENTS ON A

GROSS BASIS, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE BEGINNING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. SINCE THIS

STANDARD IMPACTS DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ONLY, ITS ADOPTION WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT GOODWILL BE TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS A

CHANGE IN REPORTING UNITS OR THE TESTING OF RECOVERABILITY OF A SIGNIFICANT

ASSET GROUP WITHIN A REPORTING UNIT. AT 3M, REPORTING UNITS GENERALLY

CORRESPOND TO A DIVISION.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 17 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009,

3M MADE CERTAIN PRODUCT MOVES BETWEEN ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. SINCE THERE WERE

NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN GOODWILL BALANCES BETWEEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AMOUNTS

PRESENTED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE HAVE NOT BEEN RECLASSIFIED. FOR THOSE CHANGES

THAT RESULTED IN REPORTING UNIT CHANGES, THE COMPANY APPLIED THE RELATIVE FAIR

VALUE METHOD TO DETERMINE THE IMPACT TO REPORTING UNITS. DURING THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2009, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ASSESSMENT OF ANY POTENTIAL GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT FOR REPORTING UNITS IMPACTED BY THIS NEW STRUCTURE AND DETERMINED

THAT NO IMPAIRMENT EXISTED.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 13,

IN JUNE 2009, 3M TESTED THE LONG LIVED ASSETS GROUPING ASSOCIATED WITH THE

U.K. PASSPORT PRODUCTION ACTIVITY OF 3MS SECURITY SYSTEMS DIVISION FOR

RECOVERABILITY. THIS CIRCUMSTANCE REQUIRED THE COMPANY TO ALSO TEST GOODWILL

FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT (SECURITY SYSTEMS DIVISION) LEVEL. 3M

COMPLETED ITS ASSESSMENT OF POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR THIS REPORTING

UNIT AND DETERMINED THAT NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT EXISTED AS OF JUNE 30,

2009. THE COMPANY ALSO COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009 FOR ALL REPORTING UNITS AND DETERMINED THAT NO

IMPAIRMENT EXISTED. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAD NO IMPAIRMENTS OF GOODWILL IN

NOTE 4.  RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES GENERALLY

INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS INVOLVING EMPLOYEE-RELATED SEVERANCE CHARGES,

CONTRACT TERMINATION COSTS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH

ACTIONS.

EMPLOYEE-RELATED

SEVERANCE CHARGES ARE LARGELY BASED UPON DISTRIBUTED EMPLOYMENT POLICIES AND

SUBSTANTIVE SEVERANCE PLANS. THESE CHARGES ARE REFLECTED IN THE QUARTER IN

WHICH MANAGEMENT APPROVES THE ASSOCIATED ACTIONS, THE ACTIONS ARE PROBABLE, AND

THE AMOUNTS ARE ESTIMABLE. SEVERANCE AMOUNTS FOR WHICH AFFECTED EMPLOYEES WERE

REQUIRED TO RENDER SERVICE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE BENEFITS AT THEIR TERMINATION

DATES WERE MEASURED AT THE DATE SUCH BENEFITS WERE COMMUNICATED TO THE APPLICABLE

EMPLOYEES AND RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE EMPLOYEES REMAINING SERVICE

PERIODS.

CONTRACT

TERMINATION AND OTHER CHARGES PRIMARILY REFLECT COSTS TO TERMINATE A CONTRACT

BEFORE THE END OF ITS TERM (MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME THE COMPANY

PROVIDED NOTICE TO THE COUNTERPARTY) OR COSTS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE INCURRED

UNDER THE CONTRACT FOR ITS REMAINING TERM WITHOUT ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO THE

COMPANY. AS DISCUSSED IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN NOTE 1, ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT REFLECT

THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUES OVER THEIR FAIR VALUES.

FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M THAT RELATED TO

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE IN THE INCOME STATEMENT WERE $141 MILLION

PRE-TAX ($92 MILLION AFTER-TAX) IN 2009, $79 MILLION PRE-TAX ($52 MILLION

AFTER-TAX) IN 2008, AND $198 MILLION PRE-TAX ($123 MILLION AFTER-TAX) IN 2007.

THESE PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AMOUNTS ARE SHOWN IN THE TABLE IN NOTE

11 AS AMORTIZATION OF TRANSITION (ASSET) OBLIGATION, AMORTIZATION OF PRIOR

SERVICE COST (BENEFIT) AND AMORTIZATION OF NET ACTUARIAL (GAIN) LOSS. CASH FLOW

RECLASSIFICATIONS TO EARNINGS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M FOR DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES PRIMARILY RELATE TO A LOSS OF

APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION PRE-TAX FOR 2009, AS SHOWN IN THE AUCTION RATE

SECURITIES TABLE IN NOTE 13, A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION PRE-TAX ($4

MILLION AFTER TAX) FOR 2008, AND WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR 2007. OTHER

TRANSFER OF OWNERSHIP INTEREST

INVOLVING NON-WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARIES

DURING 2009, A WHOLLY

OWNED SUBSIDIARY THAT, IN TURN, OWNED A PORTION OF THE COMPANYS MAJORITY OWNED

SUMITOMO 3M LIMITED ENTITY, WAS TRANSFERRED TO ANOTHER SUBSIDIARY THAT IS

MAJORITY, RATHER THAN WHOLLY, OWNED. AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSACTION, 3MS

EFFECTIVE OWNERSHIP IN SUMITOMO 3M LIMITED WAS REDUCED FROM 75 PERCENT TO 71.5

PERCENT. THE TRANSFER WAS EFFECTED TO FURTHER ALIGN ACTIVITIES IN THE ASSOCIATED

REGION AND TO SIMPLIFY THE COMPANYS OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE. BECAUSE THE COMPANY

RETAINED ITS CONTROLLING INTEREST IN THE SUBSIDIARIES INVOLVED, THE TRANSFER

RESULTED IN A DECREASE IN 3M COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AND AN INCREASE IN

NONCONTROLLING INTEREST OF $81 MILLION. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE

EFFECTS OF THIS TRANSFER ON EQUITY ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M COMPANY SHAREHOLDERS.

AUTHORITIES FOR YEARS BEFORE 2002.

THE INTERNAL REVENUE

SERVICE (IRS) COMPLETED ITS EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANYS U.S. FEDERAL INCOME

TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2002 THROUGH 2004 IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. THE

OUTCOME OF THE 2002 THROUGH 2004 AUDIT CYCLE IMPACTED THE 2001 TAX YEAR, WHICH

WAS SETTLED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008. THE IRS COMPLETED ITS FIELD

EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANYS U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2005

THROUGH 2007 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009. THE COMPANY HAS PROTESTED CERTAIN

IRS POSITIONS WITHIN THESE TAX YEARS AND IS EXPECTED TO ENTER THE

ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS PROCESS WITH THE IRS DURING 2010. CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY

IS UNDER EXAMINATION BY THE IRS FOR ITS U.S. FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE

YEARS 2008 AND 2009. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT THE IRS WILL COMPLETE ITS

EXAMINATION OF THE COMPANY FOR 2008 BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010 AND

FOR 2009 BY THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2011. AS

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE IRS HAS NOT PROPOSED ANY SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANYS TAX

POSITIONS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS NOT ADEQUATELY RESERVED. PAYMENTS RELATING

TO ANY PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS ARISING FROM THE 2005 THROUGH 2009 AUDITS MAY NOT

BE MADE UNTIL A FINAL AGREEMENT IS REACHED BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE IRS ON

SUCH ASSESSMENTS OR UPON A FINAL RESOLUTION RESULTING FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE

APPEALS PROCESS OR JUDICIAL ACTION. IN ADDITION TO THE U.S. FEDERAL

EXAMINATION, THERE IS ALSO LIMITED AUDIT ACTIVITY IN SEVERAL U.S. STATE AND

FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.

3M ANTICIPATES CHANGES TO

THE COMPANYS UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS DUE TO THE CLOSING OF THE VARIOUS AUDIT

YEARS MENTIONED ABOVE. CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY

ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL

INCREASE OR DECREASE DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AS A RESULT OF THE ONGOING

INCOME TAX AUTHORITY EXAMINATIONS.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE

NEW GUIDANCE RELATING TO ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES, IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 740,

,

ON JANUARY 1, 2007. UPON ADOPTION, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN IMMATERIAL

GROSS BALANCE FOR ITEMS SUCH AS FEDERAL, STATE, AND NON-U.S. DEFERRED ITEMS,

INTEREST AND PENALTIES, AND DEDUCTIBLE TAXES. THE NET UTB IS INCLUDED AS

COMPONENTS OF OTHER CURRENT ASSETS, OTHER ASSETS, AND OTHER LIABILITIES WITHIN

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES

INTEREST AND PENALTIES ACCRUED RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN TAX

EXPENSE. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME ON A

GROSS BASIS APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION, $8 MILLION, AND $9 MILLION OF EXPENSE IN

2009, 2008, AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND DECEMBER 31,

2008, ACCRUED INTEREST AND PENALTIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ON A

GROSS BASIS WERE $53 MILLION AND $47 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN THESE

INTEREST AND PENALTY AMOUNTS ARE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO TAX

POSITIONS FOR WHICH THE ULTIMATE DEDUCTIBILITY IS HIGHLY CERTAIN BUT FOR WHICH

THERE IS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING OF SUCH DEDUCTIBILITY. BECAUSE OF THE

IMPACT OF DEFERRED TAX ACCOUNTING, OTHER THAN INTEREST AND PENALTIES, THE

DISALLOWANCE OF THE SHORTER DEDUCTIBILITY PERIOD WOULD NOT AFFECT THE ANNUAL

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BUT WOULD ACCELERATE THE PAYMENT OF CASH TO THE TAXING

AUTHORITY TO AN EARLIER PERIOD.

THE COMPANY MADE

DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN OF $710 MILLION

IN 2009, $200 MILLION IN 2008, AND $200 MILLION IN 2007. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY MADE CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS OF $504 MILLION

IN 2009, $186 MILLION IN 2008, AND $151 MILLION IN 2007. THE CURRENT INCOME TAX

PROVISION INCLUDES A BENEFIT FOR THE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS; THE DEFERRED TAX

PROVISION INCLUDES A COST FOR THE RELATED TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE.

AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN

EMPLOYMENT COMMITMENTS AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MADE BY 3M, INCOME FROM

MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES IN TAIWAN, CHINA, BRAZIL, KOREA, AND SINGAPORE IS

SUBJECT TO REDUCED TAX RATES OR, IN SOME CASES, IS EXEMPT FROM TAX FOR YEARS

THROUGH 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, AND 2023, RESPECTIVELY. THE INCOME TAX BENEFITS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TAX STATUS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $50

MILLION (7 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2009, $44 MILLION (6 CENTS PER DILUTED

SHARE) IN 2008, AND $47 MILLION (6 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2007.

COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE REINVESTED INDEFINITELY. THESE

EARNINGS RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS AND WERE APPROXIMATELY $5.6 BILLION AS OF

CLASSIFICATION

OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AS CURRENT OR NON-CURRENT IS DEPENDENT UPON MANAGEMENTS

INTENDED HOLDING PERIOD, THE SECURITYS MATURITY DATE AND LIQUIDITY

CONSIDERATIONS BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS. IF MANAGEMENT INTENDS TO HOLD THE

SECURITIES FOR LONGER THAN ONE YEAR AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE, THEY ARE

CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES

TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $12 MILLION (PRE-TAX), WHILE GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS

TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $3 MILLION (PRE-TAX). AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, GROSS

UNREALIZED LOSSES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION (PRE-TAX), WHILE GROSS

UNREALIZED GAINS WERE NOT MATERIAL. GROSS REALIZED GAINS ON SALES OR MATURITIES

OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE NOT MATERIAL IN 2009, $5 MILLION IN 2008 AND $7

MILLION IN 2007. GROSS REALIZED LOSSES ON SALES OR MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE

SECURITIES WERE $3 MILLION FOR 2009 AND WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR 2008 AND 2007.

(ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $705 MILLION) ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF INTERESTS IN

AUTOMOBILE LOANS AND CREDIT CARDS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE ASSET-BACKED

HE COMPANYS $350 MILLION OF DEALER

REMARKETABLE SECURITIES (CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT) WERE

REMARKETED FOR ONE YEAR IN DECEMBER 2009. LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS DUE IN

2010 INCLUDE THESE $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES, WHICH MATURE

IN DECEMBER 2010, AND $146 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE NOTES. THE FLOATING

RATE NOTES ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS THE RESULT OF

PUT PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS

DUE IN 2011 INCLUDE FLOATING RATE NOTES TOTALING $100 MILLION AS A

79

TABLE OF

CONTENTS

RESULT

OF PUT PROVISIONS. ADDITIONALLY, PAYMENTS DUE IN 2012 INCLUDE THE $225 MILLION

CARRYING AMOUNT OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES, AS A RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS.

THE

ESOP DEBT, WHICH MATURED IN 2009, WAS SERVICED BY DIVIDENDS ON STOCK HELD BY

THE ESOP AND BY COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE NOT REPORTED AS

INTEREST EXPENSE, BUT WERE REPORTED AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. REFER TO NOTE 15 FOR MORE DETAIL ON THE ESOP.

OTHER BORROWINGS INCLUDED DEBT HELD BY 3MS INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES AND

FLOATING RATE NOTES IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH THE LONG-TERM PORTION OF THIS

DEBT PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF U.S. DOLLAR FLOATING RATE DEBT.

THE

COMPANY HAS AN AA- CREDIT RATING, WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK, FROM STANDARD &

POORS AND AN AA2 CREDIT RATING, WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK, FROM MOODYS INVESTORS

SERVICE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE

SECURITIES HAD RATINGS TRIGGERS (BBB-/BAA3 OR LOWER) THAT WOULD REQUIRE

REPAYMENT OF DEBT. IN ADDITION, UNDER THE COMPANYS $1.5-BILLION FIVE-YEAR

CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT THAT WAS EFFECTIVE APRIL 30, 2007, 3M IS

REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ITS EBITDA TO INTEREST RATIO AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL

QUARTER AT NOT LESS THAN 3.0 TO 1. THIS IS CALCULATED (AS DEFINED IN THE

AGREEMENT) AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL EBITDA FOR THE FOUR CONSECUTIVE

QUARTERS THEN ENDED TO TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE ON ALL FUNDED DEBT FOR THE SAME

PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THIS RATIO WAS APPROXIMATELY 27 TO 1. AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, AVAILABLE SHORT-TERM COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT, INCLUDING THE PRECEDING

$1.5 BILLION FIVE-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY, TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1.593 BILLION,

OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $145 MILLION WAS UTILIZED IN CONNECTION WITH NORMAL

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. DEBT COVENANTS DO NOT RESTRICT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

THE FLOATING RATE NOTES DUE

IN 2044 HAVE AN ANNUAL PUT FEATURE. ACCORDING TO THE TERMS, HOLDERS CAN REQUIRE

3M TO REPURCHASE THE SECURITIES AT A PRICE OF 98 PERCENT OF PAR VALUE EACH DECEMBER FROM

2005 THROUGH 2008, AT 99 PERCENT OF PAR VALUE FROM 2009 THROUGH 2013, AND AT

100 PERCENT OF PAR VALUE FROM 2014 AND EVERY ANNIVERSARY THEREAFTER UNTIL FINAL

MATURITY IN DECEMBER 2044. IN DECEMBER 2009 AND 2008, THE COMPANY WAS

REQUIRED TO REPURCHASE AN IMMATERIAL AMOUNT OF PRINCIPAL ON THIS BOND.

THE

COMPANY HAS A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT,

EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 17, 2009, WHICH REGISTERS AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF

DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES FOR FUTURE SALES. NO SECURITIES HAVE BEEN ISSUED

UNDER THIS SHELF. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO USE THE PROCEEDS FROM FUTURE SECURITIES

SALES OFF THIS SHELF FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN CONNECTION WITH A PRIOR

WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER SHELF REGISTRATION, IN JUNE 2007 THE COMPANY

ESTABLISHED A $3 BILLION MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM. THREE DEBT SECURITIES HAVE

BEEN ISSUED UNDER THIS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM. FIRST, IN DECEMBER 2007,

3M ISSUED A FIVE-YEAR, $500 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE WITH A COUPON RATE OF

4.65%. SECOND, IN AUGUST 2008, 3M ISSUED A FIVE-YEAR, $850 MILLION, FIXED

RATE NOTE WITH A COUPON RATE OF 4.375%. THIRD, IN OCTOBER 2008, THE

COMPANY ISSUED A THREE-YEAR $800 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE WITH A COUPON RATE OF

4.50%. THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP TO CONVERT THIS $800

MILLION NOTE TO A FLOATING RATE.

THE COMPANY ALSO ISSUED

NOTES UNDER AN EARLIER $1.5 BILLION MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM. IN MARCH 2007,

THE COMPANY ISSUED A 30-YEAR, $750 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE WITH A COUPON RATE

OF 5.70%. IN NOVEMBER 2006, 3M ISSUED A THREE-YEAR, $400 MILLION, FIXED

RATE NOTE. THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP TO CONVERT THIS TO A

RATE BASED ON A FLOATING LIBOR INDEX. BOTH THE NOTE AND RELATED SWAP MATURED IN

NOVEMBER 2009. IN DECEMBER 2004, 3M ISSUED A 40-YEAR, $62 MILLION

FLOATING RATE NOTE ($60 MILLION OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2009), WITH

THE RATE BASED ON A FLOATING LIBOR INDEX. THIS EARLIER $1.5 BILLION MEDIUM TERM

NOTE PROGRAM WAS REPLACED BY THE $3 BILLION PROGRAM ESTABLISHED IN JUNE 2007.

IN

JULY 2007, 3M ISSUED A SEVEN YEAR 5.0% FIXED RATE EUROBOND FOR AN AMOUNT

OF 750 MILLION EUROS (BOOK VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.123 BILLION IN U.S.

DOLLARS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009). UPON DEBT ISSUANCE IN JULY 2007, 3M

COMPLETED A FIXED-TO-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAP ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 400

MILLION EUROS AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE OF A PORTION OF THE FIXED INTEREST RATE

EUROBOND OBLIGATION. IN DECEMBER 2007, 3M REOPENED THE EXISTING SEVEN YEAR

5.0% FIXED RATE EUROBOND FOR AN ADDITIONAL AMOUNT OF 275 MILLION EUROS (BOOK

VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $398 MILLION IN U.S. DOLLARS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009).

THIS SECURITY WAS ISSUED AT A PREMIUM AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CONSOLIDATED WITH

THE ORIGINAL SECURITY ON JANUARY 15, 2008.

3M

MAY REDEEM ITS 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES (THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES) AT

ANY TIME IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT THE ACCRETED CONVERSION PRICE; HOWEVER,

BONDHOLDERS MAY CONVERT UPON NOTIFICATION OF REDEMPTION EACH OF THE NOTES INTO

9.4602 SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK (WHICH 3M WOULD INTEND TO PAYOUT IN CASH).

HOLDERS OF THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES HAVE THE OPTION TO REQUIRE 3M

TO PURCHASE THEIR NOTES AT ACCRETED VALUE ON NOVEMBER 21 IN THE YEARS

2005, 2007, 2012, 2017, 2022 AND 2027. IN NOVEMBER 2005, 22,506 OF THE

639,000 IN OUTSTANDING BONDS WERE REDEEMED, RESULTING IN A PAYOUT FROM 3M OF

APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION. IN NOVEMBER 2007, AN ADDITIONAL 364,598 OUTSTANDING

BONDS WERE REDEEMED RESULTING IN A PAYOUT FROM 3M OF APPROXIMATELY $322

MILLION. THESE PAYOUTS REDUCED THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES FACE VALUE AT MATURITY TO

$252 MILLION, WHICH EQUATES TO A BOOK VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $225 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2009. AS DISCLOSED IN A FORM 8-K IN NOVEMBER 2005, 3M AMENDED THE

80

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TERMS

OF THESE SECURITIES TO PAY CASH AT A RATE OF 2.40% PER ANNUM OF THE PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT AT MATURITY OF THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES, WHICH EQUATED TO 2.75%

PER ANNUM OF THE NOTES ACCRETED VALUE ON NOVEMBER 21, 2005. THE CASH

INTEREST PAYMENTS WERE MADE SEMIANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON MAY 22, 2006, NOVEMBER 22,

2006, MAY 22, 2007 AND NOVEMBER 22, 2007 TO HOLDERS OF RECORD ON THE

15TH CALENDAR DAY PRECEDING EACH SUCH INTEREST PAYMENT DATE. EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 22,

2007, THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE REVERTED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL YIELD OF 0.50%.

3M

ORIGINALLY SOLD $639 MILLION IN AGGREGATE FACE AMOUNT OF THESE CONVERTIBLE

NOTES ON NOVEMBER 15, 2002, WHICH ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF 3M

COMMON STOCK. THE GROSS PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING, TO BE USED FOR GENERAL

CORPORATE PURPOSES, WERE $550 MILLION ($540 MILLION NET OF ISSUANCE COSTS). AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1, 3M ADOPTED CHANGES TO ACCOUNTING FOR CONVERTIBLE DEBT

INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN CASH UPON CONVERSION (INCLUDING PARTIAL

CASH SETTLEMENT), EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, WITH RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION

TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. AS SUCH, ADDITIONAL INTEREST EXPENSE ESSENTIALLY

EQUIVALENT TO THE PORTION OF ISSUANCE PROCEEDS RETROACTIVELY ALLOCATED TO THE

INSTRUMENTS EQUITY COMPONENT WAS RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD FROM THE

CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUANCE ON NOVEMBER 15, 2002 THROUGH NOVEMBER 15,

2005 (THE FIRST DATE HOLDERS OF THESE NOTES HAD THE ABILITY TO PUT THEM BACK TO

3M). DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS WERE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A

THREE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING IN NOVEMBER 2002. DEBT ISSUE COSTS ALLOCATED

TO THE NOTES EQUITY COMPONENT WERE NOT MATERIAL. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2003, 3M

REGISTERED THESE CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN A REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THE TERMS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES INCLUDE

A YIELD TO MATURITY OF 0.50% AND AN INITIAL CONVERSION PREMIUM OF 40 PERCENT

OVER THE $65.00 (SPLIT-ADJUSTED) CLOSING PRICE OF 3M COMMON STOCK ON NOVEMBER 14,

2002. IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION (RELATING TO THE CLOSING COMMON

STOCK PRICES OF 3M EXCEEDING THE CONVERSION TRIGGER PRICE FOR SPECIFIED

PERIODS) ARE MET, HOLDERS MAY CONVERT EACH OF THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR

NOTES INTO 9.4602 SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK IN ANY CALENDAR QUARTER COMMENCING

AFTER MARCH 31, 2003. THE CONVERSION TRIGGER PRICE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2009 WAS $122.42 PER SHARE. IF THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, AND 3M

ELECTS NOT TO SETTLE IN CASH, THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES WILL BE

CONVERTIBLE IN THE AGGREGATE INTO APPROXIMATELY 2.4 MILLION SHARES OF 3M COMMON

STOCK. THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES

HAVE NEVER BEEN MET. IF THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, 3M MAY CHOOSE TO

PAY IN CASH AND/OR COMMON STOCK; HOWEVER, IF THIS OCCURS, THE COMPANY HAS THE

INTENT AND ABILITY TO SETTLE THIS DEBT SECURITY IN CASH. ACCORDINGLY, THERE WAS

NO IMPACT ON 3MS DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.

IN DECEMBER 2009, THE

COMPANYS $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE REMARKETED. THEY

WERE REISSUED WITH A FIXED COUPON RATE OF 5.61%. THESE SECURITIES, WHICH

ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, WERE ORIGINALLY ISSUED IN DECEMBER 2000

AND HAVE A FINAL MATURITY DATE OF DECEMBER 2010.

NOTE 11.  PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

3M HAS COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

IN TOTAL, 3M HAS OVER 60 PLANS IN 24 COUNTRIES. PENSION BENEFITS ASSOCIATED

WITH THESE PLANS GENERALLY ARE BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF SERVICE,

COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING

PENSION BENEFITS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES CERTAIN POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND

LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS U.S. EMPLOYEES WHO REACH

RETIREMENT AGE WHILE EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. MOST INTERNATIONAL EMPLOYEES AND

RETIREES ARE COVERED BY GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. THE COST OF COMPANY-PROVIDED

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE PLANS FOR INTERNATIONAL EMPLOYEES IS NOT MATERIAL

AND IS COMBINED WITH U.S. AMOUNTS IN THE TABLES THAT FOLLOW.

THE

COMPANYS PENSION FUNDING POLICY IS TO DEPOSIT WITH INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES

AMOUNTS ALLOWABLE BY LAW. TRUST FUNDS AND DEPOSITS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

MAINTAINED TO PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR

BENEFICIARIES. THERE ARE NO PLAN ASSETS IN THE NON-QUALIFIED PLAN DUE TO ITS

NATURE. FOR ITS U.S. POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT

PLANS, THE COMPANY HAS SET ASIDE AMOUNTS AT LEAST EQUAL TO ANNUAL BENEFIT

PAYMENTS WITH AN INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE.

IN

AUGUST 2006, THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT (PPA) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN THE

U.S. THE PPA INCREASES THE FUNDING TARGET FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS TO

100% OF THE TARGET LIABILITY. THE PPA TRANSITION RULES REQUIRE A FUNDING

LIABILITY TARGET OF 92% IN 2008, REACHING 100% BY 2011. 3MS U.S. QUALIFIED

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE FUNDED AT THE APPLICABLE TRANSITION FUNDING LIABILITY

TARGET FOR 2009.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2008, THE COMPANY MADE MODIFICATIONS TO ITS U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

PLAN. THE CHANGES WERE EFFECTIVE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009, AND ALLOW

CURRENT RETIRED EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES WHO RETIRE BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2013

THE OPTION TO CONTINUE ON THE EXISTING POSTRETIREMENT PLANS OR ELECT THE NEW

PLANS. CURRENT EMPLOYEES WHO RETIRE AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2012, WILL RECEIVE

A SAVINGS ACCOUNT BENEFITS-BASED PLAN. AS A RESULT OF THE MODIFICATION TO THE

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PLAN, THE COMPANY REMEASURED ITS U.S. PLANS

ASSETS AND ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION (APBO) AS OF MARCH 31,

2008. THE IMPACT OF THE PLAN MODIFICATIONS REDUCED THE APBO BY $148 MILLION,

WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ASSET VALUES BEING $97 MILLION LOWER THAN ON DECEMBER 31,

2007. THEREFORE, THE ACCRUED BENEFIT COST LIABILITY RECORDED ON THE BALANCE

SHEET AS OF MARCH 31, 2008, WAS REDUCED BY $51 MILLION. THE REMEASUREMENT

REDUCED THE 2008 EXPENSE BY $15 MILLION.

IN 2009, THE COMPANY MADE

FURTHER MODIFICATIONS TO ITS U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN. THE CHANGES ARE

EFFECTIVE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010, AND LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF MEDICAL

INFLATION ABSORBED BY THE COMPANY TO THREE PERCENT A YEAR. AS A RESULT, AS OF

THE DECEMBER 31, 2009 MEASUREMENT DATE, THE APBO WAS REDUCED BY $168

MILLION.

DURING

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009, THE COMPANY OFFERED A VOLUNTARY EARLY RETIREMENT

INCENTIVE PROGRAM TO CERTAIN ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS OF ITS U.S. PENSION PLANS

WHO MET AGE AND YEARS OF PENSION SERVICE REQUIREMENTS. THE ELIGIBLE

PARTICIPANTS WHO ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND RETIRED BY JUNE 1, 2009, RECEIVED

AN ENHANCED PENSION BENEFIT. PENSION BENEFITS WERE ENHANCED BY ADDING ONE

ADDITIONAL YEAR OF PENSION SERVICE AND ONE ADDITIONAL YEAR OF AGE FOR CERTAIN BENEFIT

CALCULATIONS. APPROXIMATELY 700 PARTICIPANTS ACCEPTED THE OFFER AND RETIRED BY JUNE 1,

2009. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY INCURRED A $21 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THESE

SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS.

DURING

2009, 3M SUMITOMO (JAPAN) EXPERIENCED A HIGHER NUMBER OF RETIREMENTS THAN

NORMAL, LARGELY DUE TO EARLY RETIREMENT INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, WHICH REQUIRED

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES WHO ELECTED TO LEAVE THE COMPANY TO RETIRE BY SEPTEMBER 2009.

PARTICIPANTS IN THE JAPAN PENSION PLAN HAD THE OPTION OF RECEIVING CASH LUMP

SUM PAYMENTS WHEN EXITING THE PLAN, WHICH A NUMBER OF PARTICIPANTS EXITING THE

PENSION PLAN ELECTED TO RECEIVE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH ASC 715,

COMPENSATION  RETIREMENT BENEFITS,

SETTLEMENT ACCOUNTING IS

REQUIRED WHEN THE LUMP SUM DISTRIBUTIONS IN A YEAR ARE GREATER THAN THE SUM OF

THE ANNUAL SERVICE AND INTEREST COSTS. DUE TO THE LARGE NUMBER OF LUMP SUM

PAYMENT ELECTIONS IN 2009 THE COMPANY INCURRED $17 MILLION OF SETTLEMENT

CHARGES.

3M

WAS INFORMED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009 THAT THE GENERAL PARTNERS OF WG

TRADING COMPANY, IN WHICH 3MS BENEFIT PLANS HOLD LIMITED PARTNERSHIP

INTERESTS, ARE THE SUBJECT OF A CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION AS WELL AS CIVIL

PROCEEDINGS BY THE SEC AND CFTC (COMMODITY FUTURES TRADING COMMISSION). AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009 THESE HOLDINGS REPRESENTED LESS THAN 2 PERCENT OF 3MS FAIR VALUE OF TOTAL

PLAN ASSETS. THE COURT APPOINTED RECEIVER HAS TAKEN CONTROL OF WG TRADING

COMPANY AND OTHER ENTITIES CONTROLLED BY ITS GENERAL PARTNERS, AND FURTHER

REDEMPTIONS OF LIMITED PARTNERSHIP INTERESTS ARE RESTRICTED PENDING COURT

PROCEEDINGS. 3M CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT THE RESOLUTION OF THESE EVENTS WILL NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE

COMPANY. THE COMPANY HAS INSURANCE THAT IT BELIEVES, BASED ON WHAT IS CURRENTLY

KNOWN, IS APPLICABLE TO THIS POTENTIAL LOSS.

THE COMPANY DETERMINES

THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE DECEMBER 31

MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS, WHICH

IS ALSO THE DATE USED FOR THE RELATED ANNUAL MEASUREMENT ASSUMPTIONS. THE

DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES

COULD BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THE COMPANY SETS ITS RATE

TO REFLECT THE YIELD OF A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY, FIXED-INCOME DEBT

INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD PRODUCE CASH FLOWS SUFFICIENT IN TIMING AND AMOUNT TO

SETTLE PROJECTED FUTURE BENEFITS. USING THIS METHODOLOGY, THE COMPANY

DETERMINED A DISCOUNT RATE OF 5.77% FOR PENSION AND 5.62% FOR POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFITS TO BE APPROPRIATE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WHICH IS A DECREASE OF

0.37 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT AND 0.52 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT, RESPECTIVELY, FROM

THE RATE USED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. FOR THE INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS THE DISCOUNT RATES ALSO REFLECT THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH

THE ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR.

IF THE COUNTRY HAS A DEEP MARKET IN CORPORATE BONDS THE COMPANY MATCHES THE

EXPECTED CASH FLOWS FROM THE PLAN EITHER TO A PORTFOLIO OF BONDS THAT GENERATE

SUFFICIENT CASH FLOW OR A NOTIONAL YIELD CURVE GENERATED FROM AVAILABLE BOND

INFORMATION. IN COUNTRIES THAT DO NOT HAVE A DEEP MARKET IN CORPORATE BONDS,

GOVERNMENT BONDS ARE CONSIDERED WITH A RISK PREMIUM TO APPROXIMATE CORPORATE

BOND YIELDS.

FOR

THE U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLANS, THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN

ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.50% IN 2009. PROJECTED RETURNS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON

BROAD, PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY AND FIXED-INCOME INDICES AND FORWARD-LOOKING

ESTIMATES OF ACTIVE PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE COMPANYS 2010 EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS

IS BASED ON AN ASSET ALLOCATION ASSUMPTION OF 40% GLOBAL EQUITIES, WITH AN

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF 8.7%, 13% PRIVATE EQUITIES WITH AN

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF 12.7%; 26% FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES WITH AN

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF 4.6%; 16% ABSOLUTE RETURN INVESTMENTS

INDEPENDENT OF TRADITIONAL PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS, WITH AN EXPECTED LONG TERM

RETURN OF 6.5%; AND 5% COMMODITIES WITH AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF

6.4%. THE COMPANY EXPECTS ADDITIONAL POSITIVE RETURN FROM ACTIVE INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSUMPTIONS RESULT IN AN 8.50% EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON AN

ANNUALIZED BASIS IN 2010. THE ACTUAL RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS IN 2009 WAS

12.6%. IN 2008 THE PLAN EXPERIENCED A LOSS OF 13.6% AND IN 2007 EARNED A RATE

OF RETURN IN EXCESS OF 14%. THE AVERAGE ANNUAL ACTUAL RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS

OVER THE PAST 10 AND 25 YEARS HAS BEEN 5.6% AND 11.2%, RESPECTIVELY. RETURN ON

ASSETS ASSUMPTIONS FOR INTERNATIONAL PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLANS ARE CALCULATED ON A PLAN-BY-PLAN BASIS USING PLAN ASSET ALLOCATIONS AND

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTIONS.

DURING

2009, THE COMPANY MADE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $710 MILLION TO ITS

PRINCIPAL U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. OF THE $710 MILLION, $600 MILLION WAS

CONTRIBUTED IN SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK, WHICH IS CONSIDERED A

NON-CASH FINANCING ACTIVITY. IN 2010, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE AN

AMOUNT IN THE RANGE OF $500 MILLION TO $700 MILLION TO ITS U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL RETIREMENT PLANS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED MINIMUM

PENSION CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2010. THEREFORE, THE

AMOUNT OF THE ANTICIPATED DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION COULD VARY SIGNIFICANTLY

DEPENDING ON THE U.S. PLANS FUNDED STATUS AND THE ANTICIPATED TAX

DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE CONTRIBUTION.

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE TREND RATES

THE COMPANY REVIEWS

EXTERNAL DATA AND ITS OWN HISTORICAL TRENDS FOR HEALTH CARE COSTS TO DETERMINE

THE HEALTH CARE TREND RATES FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006, THE COMPANY MODIFIED ITS HEALTH CARE TREND RATES ASSUMPTION BY RAISING

THE RATE AND SEPARATING THE TREND RATES USED FOR PLAN PARTICIPANTS LESS THAN 65

YEARS OF AGE AND PLAN PARTICIPANTS 65 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. THE SEPARATION OF

THE TREND RATES REFLECTS THE HIGHER COSTS

THREE PERCENT; THE REMAINING INFLATION WILL BE PASSED ON TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS.

SINCE THE COMPANY HAS LIMITED ITS INFLATIONARY COSTS A CHANGE IN MEDICAL TREND

RATE ONLY IMPACTS THE AMOUNT OF MEDICARE SUBSIDY IT WILL RECEIVE. A ONE

PLAN ASSET MANAGEMENT

3MS

INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IS TO MANAGE THE

FUNDS ON A GOING-CONCERN BASIS. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE FUNDS IS TO MEET THE

OBLIGATIONS AS REQUIRED. THE SECONDARY GOAL IS TO EARN THE HIGHEST RATE OF

RETURN POSSIBLE, WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING ITS PRIMARY GOAL, AND WITHOUT SUBJECTING

THE COMPANY TO AN UNDUE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTION RATE VOLATILITY. FUND RETURNS ARE

USED TO HELP FINANCE PRESENT AND FUTURE OBLIGATIONS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE

WITHIN ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED FUNDING LIMITS AND TAX-DETERMINED ASSET LIMITS,

THUS REDUCING THE LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTIONS 3M MUST MAKE. THE INVESTMENT STRATEGY

HAS USED LONG DURATION CASH AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO OFFSET APPROXIMATELY

50 PERCENT OF THE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY OF U.S. PENSION LIABILITIES. IN

ADDITION, CREDIT RISK IS MANAGED THROUGH MANDATES FOR PUBLIC SECURITIES AND

MAXIMUM ISSUER LIMITS THAT ARE ESTABLISHED AND MONITORED ON A REGULAR BASIS.

DURING

2009, $600 MILLION OF 3M COMMON STOCK WAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE PRINCIPAL U.S.

QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. ALL OF THE 3M SHARES CONTRIBUTED TO THE U.S. PENSION

PLAN WERE SOLD BEFORE YEAR END BY AN INDEPENDENT FIDUCIARY TO THE PLAN.

NORMALLY, 3M DOES NOT BUY OR SELL ANY OF ITS OWN STOCK AS A DIRECT INVESTMENT

FOR ITS PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT FUNDS. HOWEVER, DUE TO

EXTERNAL INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT OF THE FUNDS, THE PLANS MAY INDIRECTLY BUY, SELL

OR HOLD 3M STOCK. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE SHARES WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO

BE MATERIAL RELATIVE TO THE AGGREGATE FUND PERCENTAGES.

THE

DISCUSSION THAT FOLLOWS REFERENCES THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF CERTAIN

ASSETS IN TERMS OF LEVELS 1, 2 AND 3. SEE NOTE 13 FOR DESCRIPTIONS OF THESE

LEVELS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

U.S. PENSION PLANS ASSETS

IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES IN THE U.S. PENSION PLANS, THE INVESTMENT POLICY INCLUDES

A TARGET STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION. THE INVESTMENT POLICY ALLOWS SOME

TOLERANCE AROUND THE TARGET IN RECOGNITION THAT MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND

ILLIQUIDITY OF SOME INVESTMENTS MAY CAUSE THE ALLOCATION TO A SPECIFIC ASSET

CLASS TO STRAY FROM THE TARGET ALLOCATION, POTENTIALLY FOR LONG PERIODS OF

TIME. ACCEPTABLE RANGES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO ALLOW FOR DEVIATION FROM

LONG-TERM TARGETS AND TO ALLOW FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TACTICAL OVER- AND

UNDER-WEIGHTS. THE PORTFOLIO WILL NORMALLY BE REBALANCED WHEN THE QUARTER-END

ASSET ALLOCATION DEVIATES FROM ACCEPTABLE RANGES. THE ALLOCATION IS REVIEWED

REGULARLY BY THE NAMED FIDUCIARY OF THE PLANS.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ASSETS

IN ORDER TO ACHIEVE THE

INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES IN THE U.S. POSTRETIREMENT PLAN, THE INVESTMENT POLICY

INCLUDES A TARGET STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION. THE INVESTMENT POLICY ALLOWS SOME

TOLERANCE AROUND THE TARGET IN RECOGNITION THAT MARKET FLUCTUATIONS AND

ILLIQUIDITY OF SOME INVESTMENTS MAY CAUSE THE ALLOCATION TO A SPECIFIC ASSET

CLASS TO STRAY FROM THE TARGET ALLOCATION, POTENTIALLY FOR LONG PERIODS OF

TIME. ACCEPTABLE RANGES HAVE BEEN DESIGNED TO ALLOW FOR DEVIATION FROM

LONG-TERM TARGETS AND TO ALLOW FOR THE OPPORTUNITY FOR TACTICAL OVER- AND

UNDER-WEIGHTS. THE PORTFOLIO WILL NORMALLY BE REBALANCED WHEN THE QUARTER-END

ASSET ALLOCATION DEVIATES FROM ACCEPTABLE RANGES. THE ALLOCATION IS REVIEWED

REGULARLY BY THE NAMED FIDUCIARY OF THE PLAN.

THE

COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS, COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS, AND

FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATE, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. THE INFORMATION

THAT FOLLOWS EXPLAINS THE VARIOUS TYPES OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS USED BY 3M, HOW AND WHY 3M USES SUCH INSTRUMENTS, HOW SUCH

INSTRUMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR, AND HOW SUCH INSTRUMENTS IMPACT 3MS FINANCIAL

POSITION AND PERFORMANCE.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

WITH RESPECT TO THE IMPACTS ON OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF NONDERIVATIVE

HEDGING AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 6. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

WITH RESPECT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IS INCLUDED IN NOTE

13. REFERENCES TO INFORMATION REGARDING DERIVATIVES AND/OR HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM DEBT ARE ALSO MADE IN NOTE 10.

TYPES OF

DERIVATIVES/HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AND INCLUSION IN INCOME/OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME

CASH FLOW HEDGES.

FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AND QUALIFY AS CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE

EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVE IS REPORTED AS A COMPONENT

OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD

DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE

DERIVATIVE REPRESENTING EITHER HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS OR HEDGE COMPONENTS

EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT

EARNINGS.

CASH FLOW

HEDGING - FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE

FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE AGAINST THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE

FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN

INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH

FLOW HEDGES. THE SETTLEMENT OR EXTENSION OF THESE DERIVATIVES WILL RESULT IN

RECLASSIFICATIONS (FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME) TO EARNINGS IN

THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS. GENERALLY, 3M

DEDESIGNATES THESE CASH FLOW HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS IN ADVANCE OF THE OCCURRENCE

OF THE FORECASTED TRANSACTION. THE PORTION OF GAINS OR LOSSES ON THE DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT PREVIOUSLY ACCUMULATED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR

DEDESIGNATED HEDGES REMAINS IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME UNTIL THE

FORECASTED TRANSACTION OCCURS. CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

AFTER DEDESIGNATION ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE

DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS SECTION BELOW. HEDGE

INEFFECTIVENESS AND THE AMOUNT EXCLUDED FROM EFFECTIVENESS TESTING RECOGNIZED

IN INCOME ON CASH FLOW HEDGES WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR 2009 AND 2008. THE MAXIMUM

LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH 3M HEDGES ITS EXPOSURE TO THE VARIABILITY IN FUTURE

CASH FLOWS FOR A MAJORITY OF THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS IS 12 MONTHS AND,

ACCORDINGLY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS OPEN

FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS HAD MATURITIES OF ONE YEAR OR

LESS. THE DOLLAR EQUIVALENT GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS FOREIGN

EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AT DECEMBER 31,

2009 WAS APPROXIMATELY $2.9 BILLION.

CASH FLOW HEDGING - COMMODITY PRICE MANAGEMENT.

THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE

RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND

FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY USES COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS RELATIVE TO

NATURAL GAS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS TO MANAGE PRICE

VOLATILITY. THE RELATED MARK-TO-MARKET GAIN OR LOSS ON QUALIFYING HEDGES IS

INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, AND

RECLASSIFIED INTO COST OF SALES IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED

TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. GENERALLY, THE LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH 3M

HEDGES ITS EXPOSURE TO THE VARIABILITY IN FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR ITS FORECASTED

NATURAL GAS TRANSACTIONS IS 12 MONTHS. NO SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY CASH FLOW

HEDGES WERE DISCONTINUED AND HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR 2009

AND 2008. THE DOLLAR EQUIVALENT GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS NATURAL

GAS COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES AT DECEMBER 31,

2009 WAS $30 MILLION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE COMPANY HAD A BALANCE OF $36 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE AFTER TAX

NET UNREALIZED LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS RECORDED IN

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. 3M EXPECTS TO RECLASSIFY TO EARNINGS

OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS A MAJORITY OF THIS BALANCE (WITH THE IMPACT OFFSET BY

CASH FLOWS FROM UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEMS).

FAIR VALUE HEDGES.

FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AND QUALIFY AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE GAIN OR

LOSS ON THE DERIVATIVES AS WELL AS THE OFFSETTING LOSS OR GAIN ON THE HEDGED

ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE HEDGED RISK ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

FAIR

VALUE HEDGING - INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES INTEREST EXPENSE USING A MIX OF

FIXED AND FLOATING RATE DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE BORROWING COSTS, THE COMPANY MAY

ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY AGREES TO

EXCHANGE, AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND FLOATING

INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AN AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT. THE DOLLAR EQUIVALENT (BASED ON INCEPTION DATE FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES) GROSS NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THE COMPANYS INTEREST RATE SWAPS AT DECEMBER 31,

2009 WAS $1.352 BILLION.

AT DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE COMPANY HAD INTEREST RATE SWAPS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF

UNDERLYING FIXED RATE OBLIGATIONS. IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED

INTO A $400 MILLION FIXED-TO-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONCURRENT WITH THE

ISSUANCE OF THE THREE-YEAR MEDIUM-TERM NOTE DUE IN 2009. THE SWAP AND THE

UNDERLYING NOTE MATURED IN NOVEMBER 2009. IN JULY 2007, IN CONNECTION

WITH THE ISSUANCE OF A SEVEN-YEAR EUROBOND FOR AN AMOUNT OF 750 MILLION EUROS,

THE COMPANY COMPLETED A FIXED-TO-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAP ON A NOTIONAL

AMOUNT OF 400 MILLION EUROS AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE OF A PORTION OF THE FIXED

INTEREST RATE EUROBOND OBLIGATION. IN MAY 2009, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO

TWO FIXED-TO-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF

$800 MILLION DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF THE FIXED INTEREST RATE

OBLIGATION UNDER THE EXISTING $800 MILLION, THREE-YEAR, 4.50% NOTES ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2008.

THE MARK-TO-MARKET OF THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES IS RECORDED AS GAINS OR LOSSES IN

INTEREST EXPENSE AND IS OFFSET BY THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE UNDERLYING DEBT

INSTRUMENT, WHICH ALSO IS RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES

ARE HIGHLY EFFECTIVE AND, THUS, THERE IS NO IMPACT ON EARNINGS DUE TO HEDGE

INEFFECTIVENESS.

FAIR VALUE HEDGING  FOREIGN

CURRENCY.

IN NOVEMBER 2008,

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PURCHASE

JAPANESE YEN, POUND STERLING, AND EUROS WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $255 MILLION

AT THE CONTRACT RATES. THESE CONTRACTS WERE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF

A

U.S. DOLLAR TAX OBLIGATION.

THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES MATURED IN EARLY JANUARY 2009. THE MARK-TO-MARKET

OF THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS WAS RECORDED AS GAINS OR LOSSES IN TAX EXPENSE AND

WAS OFFSET BY THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE UNDERLYING TAX OBLIGATION, WHICH ALSO WAS

RECORDED IN TAX EXPENSE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE CONTRACTS AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008 WAS $25 MILLION. CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THESE CONTRACTS IN 2009 THROUGH

THEIR MATURITY WERE NOT MATERIAL.

AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT,

THE COMPANY USES CROSS CURRENCY SWAPS, FORWARDS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY

DENOMINATED DEBT TO HEDGE PORTIONS OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN

OPERATIONS. FOR HEDGES THAT MEET THE EFFECTIVENESS REQUIREMENTS, THE NET GAINS

OR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN SPOT EXCHANGE RATES ARE RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE

TRANSLATION WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE REMAINDER OF THE CHANGE IN

VALUE OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS IS RECORDED IN EARNINGS. RECOGNITION IN EARNINGS OF

AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION IS LIMITED TO

CIRCUMSTANCES SUCH AS COMPLETE OR SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE LIQUIDATION OF THE NET

INVESTMENT IN THE HEDGED FOREIGN OPERATION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THERE

WERE NO CROSS CURRENCY SWAPS OR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS DESIGNATED

AS NET INVESTMENT HEDGES.

IN NOVEMBER 2006,

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR FLOATING-TO-FLOATING CROSS CURRENCY SWAP

WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $200 MILLION. THIS TRANSACTION WAS A PARTIAL HEDGE OF

THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES. THIS SWAP CONVERTED

U.S. DOLLAR-BASED VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS TO EURO-BASED VARIABLE INTEREST

PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT. THIS SWAP MATURED IN NOVEMBER 2009.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR FLOATING-TO-FLOATING CROSS CURRENCY SWAP

WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $300 MILLION. THIS TRANSACTION WAS A PARTIAL HEDGE OF

THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THIS SWAP CONVERTED

U.S. DOLLAR-BASED VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS TO YEN-BASED VARIABLE INTEREST

PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT. THIS SWAP MATURED IN SEPTEMBER 2009.

IN ADDITION TO THE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS USED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS IN NET INVESTMENT HEDGES, 3M

ALSO USES FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT AS NONDERIVATIVE HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS IN CERTAIN NET INVESTMENT HEDGES. IN JULY AND DECEMBER 2007,

THE COMPANY ISSUED SEVEN-YEAR FIXED RATE EUROBOND SECURITIES FOR AMOUNTS OF 750

MILLION EUROS AND 275 MILLION EUROS, RESPECTIVELY. 3M DESIGNATED EACH OF THESE

EUROBOND ISSUANCES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN

ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR CURRENCY EFFECTS, INCLUDING HEDGING IMPACTS,

DECREASED NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M BY APPROXIMATELY $220 MILLION IN 2009

AND INCREASED NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M BY APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION IN

2008 AND $150 MILLION IN 2007. THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF TRANSLATING

PROFITS FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS; THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF GOODS BETWEEN 3M OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES AND ABROAD; AND TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISKS AND THE

NEGATIVE IMPACT OF SWAPPING VENEZUELAN BOLIVARS INTO U.S. DOLLARS. 3M ESTIMATES

THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES HAD AN

IMMATERIAL IMPACT IN 2009, AND INCREASED NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO 3M BY

APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION IN 2008 AND BY APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION IN 2007.

CREDIT

RISK.

THE COMPANY

IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES IN

INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS, COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS, AND FORWARD AND

OPTION CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANYS RISK IS LIMITED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK

THROUGH THE USE OF CREDIT APPROVALS AND CREDIT LIMITS, AND BY SELECTING MAJOR

INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES. 3M HAS

CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENTS IN PLACE WITH TWO OF ITS PRIMARY DERIVATIVES

COUNTERPARTIES. UNDER THESE AGREEMENTS, EITHER PARTY IS REQUIRED TO POST

ELIGIBLE COLLATERAL WHEN THE MARKET VALUE OF TRANSACTIONS COVERED BY THESE

AGREEMENTS EXCEEDS SPECIFIED THRESHOLDS, THUS LIMITING CREDIT EXPOSURE FOR BOTH

TABLE OF

NOTE 13.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1,

3M ADOPTED THE NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS STANDARD, CODIFIED IN ASC 820,

PROSPECTIVELY EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, WITH RESPECT TO FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS OF (A) NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE

RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON

A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY) AND (B) ALL FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

3M ADOPTED THE REMAINING ASPECTS OF THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT STANDARD

RELATIVE TO NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR

VALUE, BUT ARE RECOGNIZED AND DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS,

PROSPECTIVELY EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009.

UNDER THE NEW STANDARD,

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE EXIT PRICE, OR THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED

TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION

BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE STANDARD ALSO

ESTABLISHES A HIERARCHY FOR INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE THAT MAXIMIZES

THE USE OF OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND MINIMIZES THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS BY

REQUIRING THAT THE MOST OBSERVABLE INPUTS BE USED WHEN AVAILABLE. OBSERVABLE

INPUTS ARE INPUTS MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN VALUING THE ASSET OR

LIABILITY DEVELOPED BASED ON MARKET DATA OBTAINED FROM SOURCES INDEPENDENT OF

THE COMPANY. UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE INPUTS THAT REFLECT THE COMPANYS

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE FACTORS MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN VALUING THE

ASSET OR LIABILITY DEVELOPED BASED UPON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THE

CIRCUMSTANCES. THE HIERARCHY IS BROKEN DOWN INTO THREE LEVELS. LEVEL 1 INPUTS

ARE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES. LEVEL 2 INPUTS INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, AND INPUTS (OTHER THAN QUOTED

PRICES) THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR

CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED UPON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF

INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS.

AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1,

AT 3M, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT UNDER ASC 820

PRINCIPALLY APPLIED TO FINANCIAL ASSET AND LIABILITIES SUCH AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS (INCLUDED AS PART OF

INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET) AND CERTAIN DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS. DERIVATIVES INCLUDE CASH FLOW HEDGES, INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND MOST

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES. THESE ITEMS WERE PREVIOUSLY AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE

MARKED-TO-MARKET AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD; HOWEVER, THE DEFINITION OF FAIR

VALUE USED FOR THESE MARK-TO-MARKETS IS NOW APPLIED USING ASC 820. THE

INFORMATION IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS AND TABLES PRIMARILY ADDRESSES MATTERS

RELATIVE TO THESE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE INFORMATION

INCORPORATES GUIDANCE RELATING TO DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL

ASSET WHEN THE MARKET FOR THAT ASSET IS NOT ACTIVE, WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M

BEGINNING WITH THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2008. THE INFORMATION ALSO

INCORPORATES THE NEW GUIDANCE DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 RELATED TO DETERMINING FAIR

VALUES WHEN THE VOLUME AND LEVEL OF ACTIVITY FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY HAVE

SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED AND IDENTIFYING TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE NOT ORDERLY,

WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M BEGINNING APRIL 1, 2009. SEPARATELY, THERE WERE

NO MATERIAL FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS WITH RESPECT TO NONFINANCIAL ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS SUBSEQUENT TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF

THE NEW STANDARD (AS IMPACTED BY ASSOCIATED UPDATES CODIFIED IN ASC 820).

3M USES VARIOUS VALUATION

TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE MARKET AND INCOME APPROACHES,

WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF

THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED FOR THE RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

MARKETABLE SECURITIES  EXCEPT AUCTION RATE SECURITIES.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES,

EXCEPT AUCTION RATE SECURITIES, ARE VALUED UTILIZING MULTIPLE SOURCES. A

WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE IS USED FOR THESE SECURITIES. MARKET PRICES ARE OBTAINED

FOR THESE SECURITIES FROM A VARIETY OF INDUSTRY STANDARD DATA PROVIDERS,

SECURITY MASTER FILES FROM LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY

SOURCES. THESE MULTIPLE PRICES ARE USED AS INPUTS INTO A

DISTRIBUTION-CURVE-BASED ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE THE DAILY FAIR VALUE TO BE

USED. 3M CLASSIFIES TREASURY SECURITIES AS LEVEL 1, WHILE ALL OTHER MARKETABLE

SECURITIES (EXCLUDING AUCTION RATE SECURITIES) ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 9.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES  AUCTION RATE SECURITIES

ONLY.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 9, AUCTION RATE SECURITIES HELD BY 3M FAILED TO

AUCTION SINCE THE SECOND HALF OF 2007. AS A RESULT, INVESTMENTS IN AUCTION RATE

SECURITIES ARE VALUED UTILIZING BROKER-DEALER VALUATION MODELS AND THIRD-PARTY

INDICATIVE BID LEVELS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE. 3M CLASSIFIES THESE

SECURITIES AS LEVEL 3.

TABLE OF

CONTENTS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE

EQUITY SECURITIES THAT ARE TRADED IN AN ACTIVE MARKET. CLOSING STOCK PRICES ARE

READILY AVAILABLE FROM ACTIVE MARKETS AND ARE USED AS BEING REPRESENTATIVE OF

FAIR VALUE. 3M CLASSIFIES THESE SECURITIES AS LEVEL 1.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.

THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVE

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF ASC 815 ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVES THAT ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE

INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS, COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS,

INTEREST RATE SWAPS, AND NET INVESTMENT HEDGES WHERE THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. NET INVESTMENT HEDGES THAT USE FOREIGN CURRENCY

DENOMINATED DEBT TO HEDGE 3MS NET INVESTMENT ARE NOT IMPACTED BY THE FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENT STANDARD UNDER ASC 820, AS THE DEBT USED AS THE HEDGING

INSTRUMENT IS MARKED TO A VALUE WITH RESPECT TO CHANGES IN SPOT FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND NOT WITH RESPECT TO OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY IMPACT

FAIR VALUE.

3M HAS DETERMINED THAT

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARDS AND COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS WILL BE CONSIDERED LEVEL 1

MEASUREMENTS AS THESE ARE TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS WHICH HAVE IDENTICAL ASSET

OR LIABILITIES, WHILE CURRENCY SWAPS, FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTIONS, INTEREST RATE

SWAPS AND CROSS-CURRENCY SWAPS WILL BE CONSIDERED LEVEL 2. FOR LEVEL 2

DERIVATIVES, 3M USES INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR

THE ASSET. THESE INPUTS INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, VOLATILITIES,

AND INTEREST RATES. THE LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE PRIMARILY VALUED USING

STANDARD CALCULATIONS/MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS READILY OBSERVABLE MARKET

PARAMETERS. INDUSTRY STANDARD DATA PROVIDERS ARE 3MS PRIMARY SOURCE FOR

FORWARD AND SPOT RATE INFORMATION FOR BOTH INTEREST RATES AND CURRENCY RATES,

WITH RESULTING VALUATIONS PERIODICALLY VALIDATED THROUGH THIRD-PARTY OR

COUNTERPARTY QUOTES AND A NET PRESENT VALUE STREAM OF CASH FLOWS MODEL.

DISCLOSURES FOR NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, BUT ARE RECOGNIZED AND DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE

ON A NONRECURRING BASIS, ARE REQUIRED PROSPECTIVELY BEGINNING JANUARY 1,

2009. DURING 2009, SUCH MEASUREMENTS OF FAIR VALUE RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE

NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO THE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

THAT CLOSED IN 2009 AND LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS IN 2009.

THE NET IDENTIFIABLE TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES (EXCLUDING GOODWILL) FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS THAT CLOSED IN

2009 (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2) WAS $50 MILLION. FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, 3M USES

INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE, SUCH AS INTEREST RATES,

COST OF CAPITAL, AND MARKET COMPARABLE ROYALTY RATES, WHICH ARE APPLIED TO

INCOME AND MARKET VALUATION APPROACHES. 3M CONSIDERS THESE LEVEL 2 INPUTS.

LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $32

MILLION PRE-TAX FOR 2009, WHICH INCLUDED THE PORTION OF 2009 RESTRUCTURING

ACTIONS RELATED TO LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4, WITH

THE COMPLETE CARRYING AMOUNT OF SUCH ASSETS WRITTEN OFF AND INCLUDED IN

OPERATING INCOME RESULTS. IN ADDITION TO THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIVITIES, IN JUNE 2009

THE COMPANY RECORDED A $13 MILLION IMPAIRMENT OF CERTAIN LONG-LIVED ASSETS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE UK PASSPORT PRODUCTION ACTIVITY OF 3MS SECURITY SYSTEMS

DIVISION (WITHIN THE SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES BUSINESS

SEGMENT). IN JUNE 2009, 3M WAS NOTIFIED THAT THE UK GOVERNMENT DECIDED TO

AWARD THE PRODUCTION OF ITS

TABLE

OF CONTENTS

PASSPORTS TO A COMPETITOR UPON THE EXPIRATION OF 3MS

EXISTING UK PASSPORT CONTRACTS IN OCTOBER 2010. ACCORDINGLY, 3M TESTED THE

LONG LIVED ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UK PASSPORT ACTIVITY FOR RECOVERABILITY

WHICH INDICATED THAT THE ASSET GROUPINGS CARRYING AMOUNT EXCEEDED THE

REMAINING EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. AS A RESULT, ASSOCIATED ASSETS WERE WRITTEN DOWN

TO A FAIR VALUE OF $41 MILLION IN JUNE 2009. 3M PRIMARILY USES A

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODEL THAT USES INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE

OBSERVABLE, SUCH AS INTEREST RATES AND COST OF CAPITAL, TO DETERMINE THE FAIR

VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS. 3M CONSIDERS THESE LEVEL 2 INPUTS. REFER TO NOTE 1 (PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS) FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF

ACCOUNTING POLICIES RELATED TO LONG-LIVED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE,

INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, BORROWINGS, AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FAIR

VALUES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AND

SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT (EXCEPT THE $350

MILLION DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES PRIOR TO 2009) APPROXIMATED CARRYING

VALUES BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS, IN ADDITION TO

CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUES AS INDICATED IN THE

PRECEDING DISCLOSURES. FAIR VALUES FOR INVESTMENTS HELD AT COST ARE NOT READILY

AVAILABLE, BUT ARE ESTIMATED TO APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY UTILIZED

THIRD-PARTY QUOTES TO ESTIMATE FAIR VALUES FOR ITS DEALER REMARKETABLE

SECURITIES AND LONG-TERM DEBT. INFORMATION WITH RESPECT TO THE CARRYING AMOUNTS

OF FIXED RATE EUROBOND SECURITIES ISSUED BY THE COMPANY AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES.

3MS FIXED-RATE BONDS ARE TRADING AT A PREMIUM AT DECEMBER 31,

CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES.

RENTAL

EXPENSE UNDER OPERATING LEASES WAS $244 MILLION IN 2009, $247 MILLION IN 2008

AND $226 MILLION IN 2007. IT IS 3MS PRACTICE TO SECURE RENEWAL RIGHTS FOR

LEASES, THEREBY GIVING 3M THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO MAINTAIN A

PRESENCE IN A LEASED FACILITY. 3M HAS TWO PRIMARY CAPITAL LEASES. FIRST, 3M HAS

A CAPITAL LEASE, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN APRIL 2003, THAT INVOLVES A

BUILDING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (WITH A LEASE TERM OF 22 YEARS). DURING THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, 3M RECORDED A CAPITAL LEASE ASSET AND OBLIGATION OF

APPROXIMATELY 33.5 MILLION UNITED KINGDOM POUNDS (APPROXIMATELY $53 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2009 EXCHANGE RATES). SECOND, DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, 3M RECORDED A

CAPITAL LEASE ASSET AND OBLIGATION OF APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION RELATED TO AN

IT INVESTMENT WITH AN AMORTIZATION PERIOD OF SEVEN YEARS.

WARRANTY LIABILITIES, RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS PART OF

CURRENT AND LONG-TERM LIABILITIES, ARE ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008. 3M DOES NOT CONSIDER THIS AMOUNT TO BE

MATERIAL. THE FAIR VALUE OF 3M GUARANTEES OF LOANS WITH THIRD PARTIES AND OTHER

GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS, EXCEPT FOR THE GUARANTEE DISCUSSED BELOW, ARE NOT

MATERIAL.

3M

SECURITY PRINTING AND SYSTEMS LIMITED, A SUBSIDIARY OF 3M, HAS PROVIDED A

GUARANTEE THROUGH 3M UNITED KINGDOM HOLDINGS PLC (ANOTHER SUBSIDIARY OF 3M) TO

THE IDENTITY AND PASSPORT SERVICE (IPS). 3M HAS GUARANTEED DEFAULT ON

PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT OF LIABILITIES UNDER A CONTRACT WITH IPS. THE AMOUNT

GUARANTEED IS 45 MILLION GREAT BRITISH POUNDS (APPROXIMATELY $71 MILLION U.S.

DOLLARS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009). THE CONTRACT EXPIRES ON OCTOBER 4,

2010. 3M DOES NOT EXPECT TO PAY OUT ANY FUNDS UNDER THIS GUARANTEE.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY AND

SOME OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS,

PRINCIPALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS WORLDWIDE. THESE

INCLUDE VARIOUS PRODUCTS LIABILITY (INVOLVING PRODUCTS THAT THE COMPANY NOW OR

FORMERLY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD), INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND COMMERCIAL CLAIMS

AND LAWSUITS, INCLUDING THOSE BROUGHT UNDER THE ANTITRUST LAWS, AND

ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS FIRST DESCRIBE THE

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED, AND THEN

DESCRIBE THE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES THE COMPANY HAS

ACCRUED RELATING TO ITS SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED,

THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ALL SUCH LITIGATION.

SHAREHOLDER

DERIVATIVE LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, IN JULY 2007, A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUIT WAS FILED IN THE

U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE AGAINST THE COMPANY AS NOMINAL

DEFENDANT AND AGAINST EACH THEN CURRENT MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

THE OFFICERS NAMED IN THE SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE OF THE 2007 PROXY

STATEMENT. THE SUIT ALLEGED

100

TABLE

OF CONTENTS

THAT THE COMPANYS

2007 PROXY STATEMENT CONTAINED FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE

TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF COMPENSATION PAYABLE UNDER THE EXECUTIVE ANNUAL INCENTIVE

PLAN (PLAN) AND THE STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE

PLAN. THE LAWSUIT SOUGHT A DECLARATION VOIDING SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE

PLAN, TERMINATION OF THE PLAN, VOIDING THE ELECTIONS OF DIRECTORS, EQUITABLE

ACCOUNTING, AND AWARDING COSTS, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES.

IN MAY 2008,

THE COMPANY AND THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS AGREED TO SETTLE THE LITIGATION

WITHOUT ADMITTING ANY LIABILITY OR WRONGDOING OF ANY KIND. THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL, CALLED FOR THE COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE OF THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION FORMALLY

STATING ITS INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE PLAN, AND THE COMPANY TO

FILE A CURRENT REPORT ON FORM 8-K TO THE SAME EFFECT, AND TO PAY UP TO

$600,000 IN ATTORNEYS FEES TO THE PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL. ON DECEMBER 30,

2008, THE COURT ISSUED AN ORDER PRELIMINARILY

APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY NOTIFIED ALL

STOCKHOLDERS OF THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND ITS TERMS AND THEIR RIGHT TO OBJECT

TO THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT. ON JUNE 5, 2009, THE COURT ISSUED AN ORDER

APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT.

FRENCH COMPETITION COUNCIL INVESTIGATION

ON DECEMBER 4,

2008, THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY IN FRANCE RECEIVED A STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS

FROM THE FRENCH COMPETITION COUNCIL ALLEGING AN ABUSE OF A DOMINANT POSITION

REGARDING THE SUPPLY OF RETRO-REFLECTIVE FILMS FOR VERTICAL SIGNING

APPLICATIONS IN FRANCE AND OF PARTICIPATION IN A CONCERTED PRACTICE WITH THE

MAJOR FRENCH MANUFACTURERS OF VERTICAL SIGNS. THE STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS IS AN

INTERMEDIATE STAGE IN THE PROCEEDINGS AND NO FINAL DETERMINATION REGARDING AN

INFRINGEMENT OF FRENCH COMPETITION RULES HAS BEEN MADE. 3M HAS FILED ITS

RESPONSE DENYING THAT THE STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS STATES A VALID CLAIM AGAINST

3M. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE FINAL OUTCOME OF THE INVESTIGATION AT THIS

TIME.

COMPLIANCE MATTERS

ON NOVEMBER 12,

2009, THE COMPANY CONTACTED THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (DOJ) AND SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) TO VOLUNTARILY DISCLOSE THAT THE COMPANY WAS

CONDUCTING AN INTERNAL INVESTIGATION AS A RESULT OF REPORTS IT RECEIVED ABOUT

ITS SUBSIDIARY IN TURKEY, ALLEGING BID RIGGING AND BRIBERY AND OTHER

INAPPROPRIATE CONDUCT IN CONNECTION WITH THE SUPPLY OF CERTAIN REFLECTIVE AND

OTHER MATERIALS AND RELATED SERVICES TO TURKISH GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. THE

COMPANY ALSO CONTACTED CERTAIN AFFECTED GOVERNMENT AGENCIES IN TURKEY. THE

COMPANY CONTINUES TO COOPERATE WITH THE DOJ AND SEC IN THE COMPANYS ONGOING

INVESTIGATION OF THIS MATTER. THE COMPANY RETAINED OUTSIDE COUNSEL TO CONDUCT

AN ASSESSMENT OF ITS POLICIES, PRACTICES, AND CONTROLS AND TO EVALUATE ITS

OVERALL COMPLIANCE WITH THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT. THE COMPANY CANNOT

PREDICT AT THIS TIME THE OUTCOME OF ITS INVESTIGATION OR WHAT REGULATORY

ACTIONS MAY BE TAKEN OR WHAT OTHER CONSEQUENCES MAY RESULT.

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS

LITIGATION

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE COMPANY IS A NAMED DEFENDANT, WITH MULTIPLE CO-DEFENDANTS, IN

NUMEROUS LAWSUITS IN VARIOUS COURTS THAT PURPORT TO REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 2,510

INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS, DOWN FROM THE APPROXIMATELY 2,700 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS

WITH ACTIONS PENDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THE VAST MAJORITY

OF THE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RESOLVED BY AND CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST THE

COMPANY ALLEGE USE OF SOME OF THE COMPANYS MASK AND RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND

SEEK DAMAGES FROM THE COMPANY AND OTHER DEFENDANTS FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY

FROM WORKPLACE EXPOSURES TO ASBESTOS, SILICA, COAL MINE DUST OR OTHER

OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS FOUND IN PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS OR

GENERALLY IN THE WORKPLACE. A MINORITY OF CLAIMANTS GENERALLY ALLEGE PERSONAL

INJURY FROM OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS FROM PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY

MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH ARE OFTEN UNSPECIFIED, AS WELL AS PRODUCTS

MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS, OR OCCASIONALLY AT COMPANY PREMISES.

SINCE

APPROXIMATELY 2006, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE

NUMBER OF NEW CLAIMS FILED ANNUALLY BY APPARENTLY UNIMPAIRED CLAIMANTS. THE

COMPANY ATTRIBUTES THIS DECLINE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING CERTAIN CHANGES

ENACTED IN SEVERAL STATES IN RECENT YEARS OF THE LAW GOVERNING ASBESTOS-RELATED

CLAIMS, AND THE HIGHLY-PUBLICIZED DECISION IN MID-2005 OF THE UNITED STATES

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS THAT IDENTIFIED AND CRITICIZED

ABUSES BY CERTAIN ATTORNEYS, DOCTORS AND X-RAY SCREENING COMPANIES ON BEHALF OF

PRIMARILY UNIMPAIRED CLAIMANTS, MANY OF WHOM WERE RECRUITED BY PLAINTIFFS

LAWYERS THROUGH MASS CHEST X-RAY SCREENINGS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE FILING OF

CLAIMS BY UNIMPAIRED CLAIMANTS IN THE FUTURE TO CONTINUE AT MUCH LOWER LEVELS

THAN IN THE PAST. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DUE TO THIS CHANGE IN THE TYPE AND

VOLUME OF INCOMING CLAIMS, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS ALLEGING MORE

SERIOUS INJURIES, INCLUDING MESOTHELIOMA AND OTHER MALIGNANCIES, WHILE

REMAINING RELATIVELY CONSTANT, WILL REPRESENT A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL

CLAIMS THAN IN THE PAST. THE COMPANY HAS DEMONSTRATED IN PAST TRIAL PROCEEDINGS

THAT ITS RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS ARE EFFECTIVE AS CLAIMED WHEN USED IN

THE INTENDED MANNER AND IN THE INTENDED CIRCUMSTANCES. CONSEQUENTLY THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT CLAIMANTS ARE UNABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT THEIR MEDICAL CONDITIONS,

EVEN IF SIGNIFICANT, ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANYS RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS.

NONETHELESS THE COMPANYS LITIGATION EXPERIENCE INDICATES THAT CLAIMS OF

PERSONS WITH MALIGNANT CONDITIONS ARE COSTLIER TO RESOLVE THAN THE CLAIMS OF

UNIMPAIRED PERSONS, AND IT THEREFORE BELIEVES THE AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING

PENDING AND FUTURE CLAIMS

101

TABLE

OF CONTENTS

ON A PER-CLAIM

BASIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE HIGHER THAN IT EXPERIENCED IN PRIOR PERIODS WHEN THE

VAST MAJORITY OF CLAIMS WERE ASSERTED BY THE UNIMPAIRED.

THE COMPANY TRIED

ITS NINTH RESPIRATOR CASE IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF ALAMEDA COUNTY, CALIFORNIA.

THE PLAINTIFF, WHO IS SUFFERING FROM MESOTHELIOMA AS A RESULT OF HIS EXPOSURE

TO ASBESTOS, CLAIMED THAT THE COMPANYS RESPIRATORS WERE DEFECTIVE AND FAILED

TO PROVIDE HIM WITH ADEQUATE PROTECTION AND CAME WITH INADEQUATE WARNINGS. ON JULY 6,

2009, AFTER NEARLY FOUR MONTHS OF TRIAL, THE JUDGE GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION

TO DISMISS ALL CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY AT THE END OF THE PLAINTIFFS CASE.

THE TRIAL JUDGE DISMISSED THE CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY BECAUSE THE PLAINTIFF

FAILED TO PROVE THAT A DEFECT IN THE COMPANYS RESPIRATOR OR ITS WARNINGS WAS A

SUBSTANTIAL FACTOR IN CAUSING THE PLAINTIFFS MESOTHELIOMA. THE PLAINTIFF HAS

FILED AN APPEAL OF THE TRIAL JUDGES DECISION. WITH THIS DISMISSAL, THE COMPANY

HAS PREVAILED IN ALL NINE CASES TAKEN TO TRIAL, INCLUDING SEVEN OF THE EIGHT

CASES TRIED TO VERDICT (SUCH TRIALS OCCURRED IN 1999, 2000, 2001, 2003, 2004,

AND 2007), AND AN APPELLATE REVERSAL IN 2005 OF THE ONE JURY VERDICT ADVERSE TO

THE COMPANY.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE

ASSERTED SPECIFIC DOLLAR CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES IN APPROXIMATELY 32% OF THE 913

LAWSUITS THAT WERE PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY AT THE END OF 2009 IN ALL JURISDICTIONS.

A MAJORITY OF STATES RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT SPECIFYING DAMAGES IN TORT CASES SUCH

AS THESE, AND MOST OF THE REMAINING JURISDICTIONS DO NOT REQUIRE SUCH

SPECIFICATION. IN THOSE CASES IN WHICH PLAINTIFFS CHOOSE TO ASSERT SPECIFIC

DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THEIR COMPLAINTS, BROUGHT IN STATES THAT PERMIT SUCH

PLEADING, THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED ARE TYPICALLY NOT MEANINGFUL AS AN INDICATOR OF

THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY. THIS IS BECAUSE (A) THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED

TYPICALLY BEAR NO RELATION TO THE EXTENT OF THE PLAINTIFFS INJURY, IF ANY; (B) THE

COMPLAINTS NEARLY ALWAYS ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS WITH THE

TYPICAL COMPLAINT ASSERTING CLAIMS AGAINST AS FEW AS A DOZEN DIFFERENT

DEFENDANTS TO UPWARDS OF 275 DIFFERENT DEFENDANTS, THE DAMAGES ALLEGED ARE NOT

ATTRIBUTED TO INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS, AND A DEFENDANTS SHARE OF LIABILITY MAY

TURN ON THE LAW OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY, WHICH CAN VARY BY STATE, AND BY

THE AMOUNT OF FAULT A JURY ALLOCATES TO EACH DEFENDANT IF A CASE IS ULTIMATELY

TRIED BEFORE A JURY; (C) MANY CASES ARE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY EVEN

THOUGH THE PLAINTIFFS DID NOT USE ANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND,

ULTIMATELY, ARE WITHDRAWN OR DISMISSED WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT; AND (D) MANY

CASES ARE BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFFS WHO HAVE NOT SUFFERED ANY MEDICAL

INJURY, AND, ULTIMATELY, ARE RESOLVED WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT OR A PAYMENT THAT IS

A SMALL FRACTION OF THE DAMAGES INITIALLY CLAIMED. OF THE 288 PENDING CASES IN

WHICH PURPORTED DAMAGE AMOUNTS ARE SPECIFIED IN THE COMPLAINTS, 144 CASES INVOLVE

CLAIMS OF $100,000 OR LESS, (FIVE (5) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE

DAMAGES OF $20 MILLION); 104 CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS BETWEEN $100,000 AND $3

MILLION (SIX (6) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $1 MILLION,

THIRTY-SIX (36) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $1.5 MILLION, AND ONE (1) OF

WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $2 MILLION); FOUR (4) CASES INVOLVE

CLAIMS OF $3 MILLION TO $7.5 MILLION (ONE (1) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE

PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $5 MILLION AND ONE (1) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE

DAMAGES OF $25 MILLION); SIX (6) CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $7.5 MILLION TO

$10 MILLION (TWO (2) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $5 MILLION

AND FOUR (4) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $21 MILLION);

FOURTEEN (14) CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $10 MILLION (ONE (1) OF WHICH ALSO

ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $5 MILLION AND SEVEN (7) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE

PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $10 MILLION); ELEVEN (11) CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $10

MILLION TO $50 MILLION (ONE (1) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF

$5 MILLION, ONE (1) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $15 MILLION,

FIVE (5) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $15.5 MILLION, AND ONE (1) OF

WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $20 MILLION); AND FIVE (5) CASES

INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $50 MILLION (THREE (3) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE

DAMAGES OF $50 MILLION). SOME COMPLAINTS ALLEGE THAT THE COMPENSATORY AND

PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE AT LEAST THE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED, THE

COMPANYS EXPERIENCE AND THE OTHER REASONS CITED INDICATE THAT THE DAMAGE

AMOUNTS SPECIFIED IN COMPLAINTS ARE NOT A MEANINGFUL FACTOR IN ANY ASSESSMENT

OF THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY.

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA, THROUGH ITS ATTORNEY GENERAL, FILED A

COMPLAINT IN 2003 AGAINST THE COMPANY AND TWO OTHER MANUFACTURERS OF

RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF LINCOLN COUNTY, WEST

VIRGINIA AND AMENDED IT IN 2005. THE AMENDED COMPLAINT SEEKS SUBSTANTIAL, BUT

UNSPECIFIED, COMPENSATORY DAMAGES PRIMARILY FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF THE COSTS

ALLEGEDLY INCURRED BY THE STATE FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION AND HEALTHCARE

BENEFITS PROVIDED TO ALL WORKERS WITH OCCUPATIONAL PNEUMOCONIOSIS AND

UNSPECIFIED PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THIS CASE HAS BEEN INACTIVE SINCE THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2007.

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS

LITIGATION  AEARO TECHNOLOGIES

ON APRIL 1,

2008, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY PURCHASED THE STOCK OF AEARO HOLDING CORP.,

THE PARENT OF AEARO TECHNOLOGIES (AEARO). AEARO MANUFACTURES AND SELLS

VARIOUS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PERSONAL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS EYE, EAR,

HEAD, FACE, FALL AND CERTAIN RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, AEARO AND/OR OTHER COMPANIES THAT PREVIOUSLY OWNED AND OPERATED AEAROS

RESPIRATOR BUSINESS (AMERICAN OPTICAL CORPORATION, WARNER-LAMBERT LLC, AO CORP.

AND CABOT CORPORATION (CABOT)) ARE NAMED DEFENDANTS, WITH MULTIPLE

CO-DEFENDANTS, INCLUDING THE COMPANY, IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS IN VARIOUS COURTS IN

WHICH PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE USE OF MASK AND RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND SEEK DAMAGES

FROM AEARO AND OTHER DEFENDANTS FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY FROM WORKPLACE

EXPOSURES TO ASBESTOS, SILICA-RELATED, OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS FOUND IN

PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS OR GENERALLY IN THE WORKPLACE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS AEARO SUBSIDIARY, HAS RECORDED $34 MILLION AS AN

ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABLE LIABILITIES FOR PRODUCT LIABILITIES AND DEFENSE COSTS

RELATED TO CURRENT AND FUTURE AEARO-RELATED ASBESTOS AND SILICA-RELATED CLAIMS.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEGAL COSTS, AS WELL AS FOR SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS, IS

CURRENTLY SHARED IN AN INFORMAL ARRANGEMENT AMONG AEARO, CABOT, AMERICAN

OPTICAL CORPORATION AND A SUBSIDIARY OF WARNER LAMBERT AND THEIR INSURERS (THE PAYOR

GROUP). LIABILITY IS ALLOCATED AMONG THE PARTIES BASED ON THE NUMBER OF YEARS

EACH COMPANY SOLD RESPIRATORY PRODUCTS UNDER THE AO SAFETY BRAND AND/OR OWNED

THE AO SAFETY DIVISION OF AMERICAN OPTICAL CORPORATION AND THE ALLEGED YEARS OF

EXPOSURE OF THE INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFF. AEAROS SHARE OF THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY

IS FURTHER LIMITED BY AN AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN AEARO AND CABOT ON JULY 11,

1995. THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT, SO LONG AS AEARO PAYS TO CABOT AN ANNUAL

FEE OF $400,000, CABOT WILL RETAIN RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR, AND

INDEMNIFY AEARO AGAINST, ASBESTOS AND SILICA-RELATED PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS

FOR RESPIRATORS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO JULY 11, 1995. BECAUSE THE DATE OF

MANUFACTURE FOR A PARTICULAR RESPIRATOR ALLEGEDLY USED IN THE PAST IS OFTEN

DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, AEARO AND CABOT HAVE APPLIED THE AGREEMENT TO CLAIMS

ARISING OUT OF THE ALLEGED USE OF RESPIRATORS WHILE EXPOSED TO ASBESTOS OR

SILICA OR PRODUCTS CONTAINING ASBESTOS OR SILICA PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 1997.

WITH THESE ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE, AEAROS POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO

EXPOSURES ALLEGED TO HAVE ARISEN FROM THE USE OF RESPIRATORS WHILE EXPOSED TO

ASBESTOS, SILICA OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 1997.

TO DATE, AEARO HAS

ELECTED TO PAY THE ANNUAL FEE. AEARO COULD POTENTIALLY BE EXPOSED TO ADDITIONAL

CLAIMS FOR SOME PART OF THE PRE-JULY 11, 1995 PERIOD COVERED BY ITS

AGREEMENT WITH CABOT IF AEARO ELECTS TO DISCONTINUE ITS PARTICIPATION IN THIS

ARRANGEMENT, OR IF CABOT IS NO LONGER ABLE TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS IN THESE

MATTERS.

DEVELOPMENTS MAY

OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE ESTIMATE OF AEAROS LIABILITIES. THESE DEVELOPMENTS

INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: (I) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF

FUTURE CLAIMS, (II) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING

CLAIMS, (III) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL COSTS OF DEFENDING THESE

CLAIMS, (IV) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE MIX AND NATURE OF CLAIMS RECEIVED,

(V) TRIAL AND APPELLATE OUTCOMES, (VI) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE LAW

AND PROCEDURE APPLICABLE TO THESE CLAIMS, (VII) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE

LIABILITY ALLOCATION AMONG THE CO-DEFENDANTS, (VIII) THE FINANCIAL

VIABILITY OF MEMBERS OF THE PAYOR GROUP INCLUDING EXHAUSTION OF AVAILABLE

COVERAGE LIMITS, (IX) THE OUTCOME OF PENDING INSURANCE COVERAGE LITIGATION

AMONG CERTAIN OTHER MEMBERS OF THE PAYOR GROUP AND THEIR RESPECTIVE INSURERS,

AND/OR (X) A DETERMINATION THAT THE INTERPRETATION OF THE CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS ON WHICH AEARO HAS ESTIMATED ITS SHARE OF LIABILITY IS INACCURATE.

THE COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF THESE POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS ON ITS

CURRENT ESTIMATE OF AEAROS SHARE OF LIABILITY FOR THESE EXISTING AND FUTURE

CLAIMS. IF ANY OF THE DEVELOPMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE WERE TO OCCUR, THE ACTUAL

AMOUNT OF THESE LIABILITIES FOR EXISTING AND FUTURE CLAIMS COULD BE

SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE RESERVED AMOUNT.

WHITAKER

LAWSUIT

: AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN DECEMBER, 2004, ONE CURRENT AND ONE FORMER EMPLOYEE OF

THE COMPANY FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF RAMSEY

COUNTY, MINNESOTA, SEEKING TO REPRESENT A CLASS OF ALL CURRENT AND CERTAIN

FORMER SALARIED EMPLOYEES EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY IN MINNESOTA BELOW A CERTAIN

SALARY GRADE WHO WERE AGE 46 OR OLDER AT ANY TIME DURING THE APPLICABLE PERIOD

TO BE DETERMINED BY THE COURT (THE WHITAKER LAWSUIT). THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES

THE PLAINTIFFS SUFFERED VARIOUS FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS

OF AGE IN VIOLATION OF THE MINNESOTA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT AND SEEKS INJUNCTIVE

RELIEF, UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES (WHICH THEY SEEK TO TREBLE UNDER THE

STATUTE), INCLUDING BACK AND FRONT PAY, PUNITIVE DAMAGES (LIMITED BY STATUTE TO

$8,500 PER CLAIMANT) AND ATTORNEYS FEES. IN JANUARY 2006, THE PLAINTIFFS

FILED A MOTION TO JOIN FOUR ADDITIONAL NAMED PLAINTIFFS. THIS MOTION WAS

UNOPPOSED BY THE COMPANY AND THE FOUR PLAINTIFFS WERE JOINED IN THE CASE,

ALTHOUGH ONE CLAIM HAS BEEN DISMISSED FOLLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL SETTLEMENT. THE

CLASS CERTIFICATION HEARING WAS HELD IN DECEMBER 2007. ON APRIL 11,

2008, THE COURT GRANTED THE PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO CERTIFY THE CASE AS A CLASS

ACTION AND DEFINED THE CLASS AS ALL PERSONS WHO WERE 46 OR OLDER WHEN EMPLOYED

BY 3M IN MINNESOTA IN A SALARIED EXEMPT POSITION BELOW A CERTAIN SALARY GRADE

AT ANY TIME ON OR AFTER MAY 10, 2003, AND WHO DID NOT SIGN A DOCUMENT ON

THEIR LAST DAY OF EMPLOYMENT PURPORTING TO RELEASE CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THEIR

EMPLOYMENT WITH 3M. ON JUNE 25, 2008, THE MINNESOTA COURT OF APPEALS

GRANTED THE COMPANYS PETITION FOR INTERLOCUTORY REVIEW OF THE DISTRICT COURTS

DECISION GRANTING CLASS CERTIFICATION IN THE CASE. ON APRIL 28, 2009, THE

COURT OF APPEALS ISSUED ITS DECISION, REVERSING THE DISTRICT COURTS CLASS

CERTIFICATION DECISION. THE COURT OF APPEALS FOUND THAT THE DISTRICT COURT HAD

NOT REQUIRED PLAINTIFFS TO MEET THE PROPER LEGAL STANDARDS FOR CERTIFICATION OF

A CLASS UNDER MINNESOTA LAW AND HAD DEFERRED RESOLVING CERTAIN FACTUAL DISPUTES

THAT WERE RELEVANT TO THE CLASS CERTIFICATION REQUIREMENTS. THE COURT OF

APPEALS REMANDED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS IN LINE

WITH THE EVIDENTIARY STANDARDS DEFINED IN ITS OPINION. THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THAT THE COURT OF APPEALS CORRECTLY DETERMINED THE PROPER LEGAL STANDARDS TO

APPLY TO MOTIONS TO CERTIFY A CLASS ACTION, BUT THE COMPANY ALSO BELIEVES THAT

PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION IN THIS CASE SHOULD BE DENIED AS A

MATTER OF LAW. ACCORDINGLY, ON MAY 28, 2009, THE COMPANY FILED IN THE

MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT A PETITION FOR PARTIAL REVIEW OF THE DECISION OF THE

COURT OF APPEALS. ON JULY 22, 2009, THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT DENIED THE

PETITION. THE TRIAL COURT HAS SCHEDULED A HEARING ON MAY 5 AND 6, 2010 TO

TAKE TESTIMONY ON THE CLASS CERTIFICATION ISSUE.

GARCIA

ACTION AGE DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT, WHICH WAS FILED IN UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA, SAN JOSE

103

TABLE

OF CONTENTS

DIVISION (THE 

GARCIA

LAWSUIT). FIVE FORMER AND ONE CURRENT EMPLOYEE OF

THE COMPANY ARE SEEKING TO REPRESENT ALL CURRENT AND FORMER SALARIED EMPLOYEES

EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY IN THE UNITED STATES DURING THE LIABILITY PERIOD, WHICH

PLAINTIFFS DEFINE AS 2001 TO THE PRESENT. IN ADDITION TO THE SIX NAMED

PLAINTIFFS, 91 OTHER CURRENT OR FORMER EMPLOYEES HAVE SIGNED OPT-IN FORMS,

SEEKING TO JOIN THE ACTION. THE

GARCIA

LAWSUIT

EXPRESSLY EXCLUDES THOSE PERSONS ENCOMPASSED WITHIN THE PROPOSED CLASS IN THE

WHITAKER

LAWSUIT. THE SAME COUNSEL, JOINED BY ADDITIONAL

CALIFORNIA COUNSEL FOR THE

GARCIA

LAWSUIT,

REPRESENTS THE PLAINTIFFS IN BOTH CASES.

THE ALLEGATIONS OF

THE COMPLAINT IN THE GARCIA LAWSUIT ARE SIMILAR TO THOSE IN THE

WHITAKER

LAWSUIT. PLAINTIFFS CLAIM THAT THEY AND OTHER

SIMILARLY SITUATED EMPLOYEES SUFFERED VARIOUS FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT

DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF AGE IN VIOLATION OF THE FEDERAL AGE

DISCRIMINATION IN EMPLOYMENT ACT. IN REGARD TO THESE CLAIMS, PLAINTIFFS SEEK TO

REPRESENT ALL PERSONS WHO WERE 46 OR OLDER WHEN EMPLOYED BY 3M IN THE UNITED

STATES IN A SALARIED POSITION BELOW THE LEVEL OF DIRECTOR, OR SALARY GRADE 18, DURING

THE LIABILITY PERIOD.  BECAUSE FEDERAL

LAW PROTECTS PERSONS AGE 40 AND OLDER FROM AGE DISCRIMINATION, WITH RESPECT TO

THEIR CLAIM OF DISPARATE IMPACT ONLY, PLAINTIFFS ALSO PROPOSE AN ALTERNATIVE

DEFINITION OF SIMILARLY SITUATED PERSONS THAT WOULD BEGIN AT AGE 40. ON BEHALF

OF THIS GROUP, PLAINTIFFS SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY

DAMAGES INCLUDING BACK AND FRONT PAY, BENEFITS, LIQUIDATED DAMAGES AND

ATTORNEYS FEES.

CERTAIN OF THE

PLAINTIFFS AND PUTATIVE CLASS MEMBERS EMPLOYMENT TERMINATED UNDER

CIRCUMSTANCES IN WHICH THEY WERE ELIGIBLE FOR GROUP SEVERANCE PLAN BENEFITS AND

IN CONNECTION WITH THOSE PLANS THEY SIGNED WAIVERS OF CLAIMS, INCLUDING AGE

DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS. PLAINTIFFS CLAIM THE WAIVERS OF AGE DISCRIMINATION

CLAIMS WERE INVALID IN VARIOUS RESPECTS. THIS SUBSET OF RELEASE-SIGNING

PLAINTIFFS SEEKS A DECLARATION THAT THE WAIVERS OF AGE DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS

ARE INVALID, OTHER INJUNCTIVE, BUT NON-MONETARY, REMEDIES, AND ATTORNEYS FEES.

ON JULY 2, 2009, THE COMPANY FILED ITS ANSWER TO THE

GARCIA

LAWSUIT

COMPLAINT AND FILED A MOTION, WHICH WAS GRANTED, TO TRANSFER THE VENUE OF THE

LAWSUIT TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA.

EEOC

AGE-DISCRIMINATION CHARGES

: SIX FORMER EMPLOYEES AND ONE CURRENT EMPLOYEE, ALL

BUT ONE OF WHOM ARE PLAINTIFFS IN THE

GARCIA

LAWSUIT,

HAVE ALSO FILED AGE DISCRIMINATION CHARGES AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH THE U.S.

EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND VARIOUS PERTINENT STATE AGENCIES.

OF THESE, THREE FORMER EMPLOYEES FILED CHARGES IN 2005 IN MINNESOTA, TEXAS, AND

CALIFORNIA. THESE FILINGS INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS THAT THE RELEASE OF CLAIMS SIGNED

BY CERTAIN FORMER EMPLOYEES IN THE PURPORTED CLASS DEFINED IN THE CHARGES IS

INVALID FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND ASSERT AGE DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF

CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER SALARIED EMPLOYEES IN STATES OTHER THAN MINNESOTA

AND NEW JERSEY. IN 2006, A CURRENT EMPLOYEE FILED AN AGE DISCRIMINATION CHARGE

AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH THE U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND

THE PERTINENT STATE AGENCY IN MISSOURI, ASSERTING CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF A CLASS

OF ALL CURRENT AND CERTAIN FORMER SALARIED EMPLOYEES WHO WORKED IN MISSOURI AND

OTHER STATES OTHER THAN MINNESOTA AND NEW JERSEY. IN 2007, A FORMER EMPLOYEE

FILED AN AGE DISCRIMINATION CHARGE AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH THE U.S. EQUAL

EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND THE PERTINENT STATE AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA,

ASSERTING CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OF ALL CURRENT AND CERTAIN FORMER

SALARIED EMPLOYEES WHO WORKED IN CALIFORNIA. IN JANUARY 2009, TWO FORMER

EMPLOYEES FILED AGE DISCRIMINATION CHARGES AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH THE U.S.

EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND THE PERTINENT STATE AGENCY IN

MINNESOTA. THE FILINGS INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS THAT THE RELEASE OF CLAIMS SIGNED BY

CERTAIN FORMER EMPLOYEES IN THE PURPORTED CLASS DEFINED IN THE CHARGES IS

INVALID FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND ASSERT AGE DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF

CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER SALARIED EMPLOYEES IN STATES OTHER THAN MINNESOTA.

THE SAME LAW FIRM REPRESENTS THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE

WHITAKER

LAWSUIT AS WELL AS THE CLAIMANTS IN EACH OF THESE EEOC PROCEEDINGS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND

LITIGATION

THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDING THOSE

PERTAINING TO AIR EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER DISCHARGES, TOXIC SUBSTANCES, AND THE

HANDLING AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTES ENFORCEABLE BY NATIONAL,

STATE, AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AROUND THE WORLD, AND PRIVATE PARTIES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS PROVIDE, UNDER CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, A BASIS FOR THE REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATION AND FOR PERSONAL

INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS. THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED, AND WILL CONTINUE

TO INCUR, COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN COMPLYING WITH THESE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, DEFENDING PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS, AND

MODIFYING ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN LIGHT OF ITS ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITIES. IN ITS EFFORT TO SATISFY ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES

AND COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE COMPANY HAS

ESTABLISHED, AND PERIODICALLY UPDATES, POLICIES RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL

STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR ITS OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE.

REMEDIATION

: UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS,

INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION

AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980 AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY MAY BE JOINTLY

AND SEVERALLY LIABLE, TYPICALLY WITH OTHER COMPANIES, FOR THE COSTS OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AT CURRENT OR FORMER FACILITIES AND AT OFF-SITE

LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS LOCATIONS, MOST OF WHICH ARE IN

THE UNITED STATES, AT WHICH IT MAY HAVE SOME LIABILITY. PLEASE REFER TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION LIABILITIES IN THE TABLE IN THE FOLLOWING SECTION, 

ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS,

REGULATORY

ACTIVITIES

: AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN VOLUNTARILY COOPERATING WITH ONGOING

REVIEWS BY LOCAL, STATE, NATIONAL (PRIMARILY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

AGENCY (EPA)), AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES OF POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH

EFFECTS OF VARIOUS PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS (PFCS), INCLUDING

PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS

104

TABLE

OF CONTENTS

(PERFLUROOCTANOIC

ACID OR PFOA AND PERFLUOROOCTANE SULFONATE OR PFOS). AS A RESULT OF ITS

PHASE-OUT DECISION IN MAY 2000, THE COMPANY NO LONGER MANUFACTURES

PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS, AND HAS AGREED TO A PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP INITIATIVE

WITH THE EPA TO END ITS USE OF PFOA BY 2015.

REGULATORY ACTIVITIES

CONCERNING PFOA AND/OR PFOS CONTINUE IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, AND BEFORE

CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL BODIES. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE GATHERING OF EXPOSURE

AND USE INFORMATION, RISK ASSESSMENT, AND CONSIDERATION OF REGULATORY

APPROACHES.

IN LATE 2008 AND EARLY

2009, THE EPA IMPLEMENTED TESTING OF PRIVATE WELLS AND SOILS AT CERTAIN

AGRICULTURAL SITES IN ALABAMA WHERE WASTEWATER TREATMENT SLUDGE WAS APPLIED

FROM A LOCAL WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT THAT RECEIVED WASTEWATER FROM NUMEROUS

INDUSTRIAL SOURCES. THE EPA ALSO TESTED PUBLIC DRINKING WATER IN LAWRENCE AND

MORGAN COUNTIES AND CONCLUDED THAT THE LEVELS OF PFOA AND PFOS ARE LOWER THAN

0.04 PART PER BILLION (PPB). THE EPA CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT THESE LEVELS ARE

NOT OF CONCERN AND IS WORKING WITH LOCAL INDUSTRY, INCLUDING 3M, TO CONTINUE

TESTING MUNICIPAL AND PRIVATE WELLS IN THE AREA. 3M AND OTHER COMPANIES ARE

JOINTLY CONDUCTING A SURVEY OF PROPERTIES NEAR THE SITES WHERE WASTEWATER

TREATMENT SLUDGE WAS APPLIED TO DETERMINE IF ANY FURTHER PRIVATE DRINKING WATER

WELLS ARE PRESENT. WHERE SUCH WELLS ARE DETERMINED TO BE PRESENT, PFOA AND PFOS

LEVELS WILL BE ASSESSED. THE EPA ALSO ISSUED PROVISIONAL HEALTH ADVISORY VALUES

(ABOVE WHICH ACTION SHOULD BE TAKEN TO REDUCE EXPOSURE TO THESE COMPOUNDS IN

DRINKING WATER) FOR PFOA OF 0.4 PPB AND PFOS OF 0.2 PPB.

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (MDH) DETECTED LOW LEVELS OF

ANOTHER PERFLUORINATED COMPOUND CALLED PERFLUOROBUTANOIC ACID (PFBA) IN

MUNICIPAL WELLS (AND IN PRIVATE WELLS AS ANNOUNCED BY THE MDH IN JUNE 2007)

IN SIX NEARBY COMMUNITIES (WOODBURY, COTTAGE GROVE, NEWPORT, ST. PAUL PARK,

SOUTH ST. PAUL, AND HASTINGS, ALL COMMUNITIES LOCATED SOUTHEAST OF ST. PAUL),

SOME OF WHICH SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED THE MDHS INTERIM ADVISORY LEVEL FOR PFBA OF 1

PPB. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE MDH ESTABLISHED A HEALTH-BASED VALUE (HBV) FOR

PFBA OF 7 PPB BASED ON A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF PFBA THROUGH THE RESULTS OF

THREE MAJOR STUDIES. AN HBV IS THE AMOUNT OF A CHEMICAL IN DRINKING WATER

CONSIDERED BY THE MDH STAFF TO BE SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO DRINK FOR A LIFETIME. AS A

RESULT OF THIS NEW HBV FOR PFBA, WELL ADVISORIES WILL NO LONGER BE REQUIRED FOR

CERTAIN WELLS IN THE MINNESOTA COMMUNITIES OF LAKE ELMO, OAKDALE AND COTTAGE

GROVE. RESIDENTS IN THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES WHERE THE LEVELS OF PFBA IN

PRIVATE WELLS EXCEED THE HBV EITHER HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS

OR CONNECTED TO A CITY WATER SYSTEM. AS PART OF LEGISLATION PASSED DURING THE

2007 MINNESOTA LEGISLATIVE SESSION DIRECTING THE MDH TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A

STATEWIDE ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH TRACKING AND BIOMONITORING PROGRAM, THE MDH

ANNOUNCED IN JULY 2008 THAT IT WILL MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF PFCS IN THE

BLOOD OF 200 ADULTS WHO LIVE IN THE MINNESOTA COMMUNITIES OF OAKDALE, LAKE ELMO

AND COTTAGE GROVE. IN JULY 2009, THE MDH REPORTED THAT THE LEVELS OF THREE

PFCS IN THE BLOOD OF RESIDENTS IN THESE COMMUNITIES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE

STUDY WERE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN THE NATIONAL AVERAGE. A LARGE BODY OF RESEARCH,

INCLUDING LABORATORY STUDIES AND EPIDEMIOLOGY STUDIES OF EXPOSED EMPLOYEES,

SHOWS THAT NO HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS ARE CAUSED BY PFCS AT CURRENT LEVELS OF

EXPOSURE. THIS RESEARCH HAS BEEN PUBLISHED IN PEER-REVIEWED SCIENTIFIC JOURNALS

AND SHARED WITH THE EPA AND GLOBAL SCIENTIFIC-COMMUNITY.

THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO WORK WITH THE MINNESOTA POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY (MPCA) PURSUANT

TO THE TERMS OF THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED MAY 2007 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND

CONSENT ORDER TO ADDRESS THE PRESENCE OF PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS IN THE SOIL

AND GROUNDWATER AT FORMER DISPOSAL SITES IN WASHINGTON COUNTY MINNESOTA AND AT

THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITY AT COTTAGE GROVE MINNESOTA. UNDER THIS

AGREEMENT, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE (I) EVALUATION OF

RELEASES OF PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS FROM THESE SITES AND PROPOSE RESPONSE

ACTIONS; (II) PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE DRINKING WATER IF AND WHEN AN HBV OR

HEALTH RISK LIMIT (HRL) (I.E., THE AMOUNT OF A CHEMICAL IN DRINKING WATER

DETERMINED BY THE MDH TO BE SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO DRINK FOR A LIFETIME) IS

EXCEEDED FOR ANY PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS AS A RESULT OF CONTAMINATION FROM

THESE SITES; (III) REMEDIATION OF ANY SOURCE OF OTHER PFCS AT THESE SITES

THAT IS NOT CONTROLLED BY ACTIONS TO REMEDIATE PFOA AND PFOS; AND (IV) SHARING

INFORMATION WITH THE MPCA ABOUT PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS. DURING 2008, THE MPCA

ISSUED FORMAL DECISIONS ADOPTING REMEDIAL OPTIONS FOR THE FORMER DISPOSAL SITES

IN WASHINGTON COUNTY MINNESOTA (OAKDALE AND WOODBURY). IN AUGUST 2009, THE

MPCA ISSUED A FORMAL DECISION ADOPTING REMEDIAL OPTIONS FOR THE COMPANYS

COTTAGE GROVE MANUFACTURING FACILITY. AT EACH LOCATION THE REMEDIAL OPTIONS

WERE AMONG THOSE RECOMMENDED BY THE COMPANY.

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A VOLUNTARY REMEDIAL ACTION AGREEMENT WITH

THE ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT (ADEM) TO ADDRESS THE

PRESENCE OF PFCS IN THE SOIL ON THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN

DECATUR, ALABAMA. FOR APPROXIMATELY TWENTY YEARS, THE COMPANY INCORPORATED

WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT SLUDGE CONTAINING PFCS IN FIELDS SURROUNDING ITS

DECATUR FACILITY PURSUANT TO A PERMIT ISSUED BY ADEM. AFTER A REVIEW OF THE

AVAILABLE OPTIONS TO ADDRESS THE PRESENCE OF PFCS IN THE SOIL, ADEM AGREED THAT

THE PREFERRED REMEDIATION OPTION IS TO USE A MULTILAYER CAP OVER THE FORMER

SLUDGE INCORPORATION AREAS ON THE MANUFACTURING SITE WITH GROUNDWATER MIGRATION

CONTROLS AND TREATMENT.

LITIGATION

: AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, A FORMER

EMPLOYEE FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN 2002 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF

MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA, INVOLVING PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY, ALLEGING THAT THE

PLAINTIFFS SUFFERED FEAR, INCREASED RISK, SUBCLINICAL INJURIES, AND PROPERTY

DAMAGE FROM EXPOSURE TO PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY AT OR NEAR THE COMPANYS

DECATUR, ALABAMA, MANUFACTURING FACILITY. THE CIRCUIT COURT IN 2005 GRANTED THE

COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS PERSONAL INJURY-RELATED

CLAIMS ON THE BASIS THAT SUCH CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE EXCLUSIVITY PROVISIONS

OF THE STATES WORKERS COMPENSATION ACT. THE PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL FILED AN

AMENDED COMPLAINT IN NOVEMBER 2006, LIMITING THE CASE TO PROPERTY DAMAGE

CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF A PURPORTED CLASS OF RESIDENTS AND PROPERTY OWNERS IN THE

VICINITY OF THE DECATUR PLANT. ALSO IN 2005, THE JUDGE IN A SECOND PURPORTED

CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT (FILED BY THREE RESIDENTS OF MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA,

SEEKING UNSTATED COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES INVOLVING ALLEGED DAMAGE TO

THEIR PROPERTY FROM EMISSIONS OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS FROM THE COMPANYS

DECATUR, ALABAMA, MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT FORMERLY MANUFACTURED THOSE

COMPOUNDS) GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO ABATE THE CASE, EFFECTIVELY PUTTING

THE CASE ON HOLD PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF CLASS CERTIFICATION ISSUES IN THE

ACTION DESCRIBED ABOVE FILED IN THE SAME COURT IN 2002. DESPITE THE STAY,

PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT SEEKING DAMAGES FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL

INJURIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE ON BEHALF OF THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS AND THE MEMBERS

OF A PURPORTED CLASS. NO FURTHER ACTION IN THE CASE IS EXPECTED UNLESS AND

UNTIL THE STAY IS LIFTED.

IN FEBRUARY 2009,

A RESIDENT OF FRANKLIN COUNTY, ALABAMA, FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT

IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF FRANKLIN COUNTY SEEKING COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF BASED ON THE APPLICATION BY THE DECATUR WASTEWATER TREATMENT

PLANT OF WASTEWATER TREATMENT SLUDGE TO FARMLAND AND GRASSLANDS IN THE STATE

THAT ALLEGEDLY CONTAIN PFOA, PFOS AND OTHER PERFLUOROCHEMICALS. THE NAMED

DEFENDANTS IN THE CASE INCLUDE 3M, DYNEON LLC, DAIKIN AMERICA, INC.,

SYNAGRO-WWT, INC., SYNAGRO SOUTH, LLC AND BIOLOGICAL PROCESSORS OF

AMERICA. THE NAMED PLAINTIFF SEEKS TO REPRESENT A CLASS OF ALL PERSONS WITHIN

THE STATE OF ALABAMA, INC. WHO, WITHIN THE PAST SIX YEARS, HAVE HAD PFOA,

PFOS AND OTHER PERFLUOROCHEMICALS RELEASED OR DEPOSITED ON THEIR PROPERTY.

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, TWO RESIDENTS OF WASHINGTON COUNTY, MINNESOTA, FILED IN OCTOBER 2004

A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF WASHINGTON COUNTY ON BEHALF

OF WASHINGTON COUNTY RESIDENTS WHO HAVE ALLEGEDLY SUFFERED PERSONAL INJURIES

AND PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM ALLEGED EMISSIONS FROM THE FORMER PERFLUOROOCTANYL

PRODUCTION FACILITY AT COTTAGE GROVE, MINNESOTA, AND FROM HISTORIC WASTE

DISPOSAL SITES IN THE VICINITY OF THAT FACILITY. AFTER THE DISTRICT COURT

GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE CLAIMS FOR MEDICAL MONITORING AND

PUBLIC NUISANCE IN APRIL 2005, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT

ADDING ADDITIONAL ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING OTHER PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS

MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY, ALLEGING ADDITIONAL LEGAL THEORIES IN SUPPORT OF

THEIR CLAIMS, ADDING FOUR PLAINTIFFS, AND SEEKING RELIEF BASED ON ALLEGED

CONTAMINATION OF THE CITY OF OAKDALE MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY AND CERTAIN PRIVATE

WELLS IN THE VICINITY OF LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA. IN APRIL 2006, THE

PLAINTIFFS FILED A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT ADDING TWO ADDITIONAL PLAINTIFFS.

THE TWO ORIGINAL PLAINTIFFS THEREAFTER DISMISSED THEIR CLAIMS AGAINST THE

COMPANY. ON JUNE 19, 2007 THE COURT DENIED THE PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO

CERTIFY THE LITIGATION AS A CLASS ACTION. THEREAFTER, TWO OF THE REMAINING

NAMED PLAINTIFFS VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED THEIR CLAIMS. IN DECEMBER 2008 AND JANUARY 2009

THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTIONS DISMISSING ALL OF THE

PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS UNDER THE MINNESOTA ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE AND LIABILITY ACT

AND ALL CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY AND EMOTIONAL DISTRESS, BUT ALLOWED THE

PLAINTIFFS TO ADD A CLAIM FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WITH RESPECT TO THEIR PROPERTY

DAMAGE CLAIMS. IN MARCH 2009, THE COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS SUMMARY

JUDGMENT MOTIONS SEEKING DISMISSAL OF THE PLAINTIFFS PRIVATE NUISANCE AND

TRESPASS TO BLOOD CLAIMS, BUT DENIED THE COMPANYS SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTION WITH

RESPECT TO THE PLAINTIFFS NEGLIGENCE AND TRESPASS TO SOIL AND WATER CLAIMS,

AND DENIED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIM FOR PUNITIVE

DAMAGES. SUBSEQUENT RULINGS BY THE COURT IN APRIL 2009 LIMITED THE

PLAINTIFFS TO PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS BASED ON NEGLIGENCE AND TRESPASS, AND

PUNITIVE DAMAGES IF PLAINTIFFS PROVED THEIR TRESPASS CLAIM. ON JUNE 17,

2009, AFTER SIX WEEKS OF TRIAL, A WASHINGTON COUNTY JURY RETURNED A UNANIMOUS

VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY ON ALL REMAINING ISSUES IN THE LAWSUIT. THE

JURY DECIDED THAT THE COMPANY WAS NOT NEGLIGENT AND HAD NOT COMMITTED A

TRESPASS, AND THAT PLAINTIFFS HAD NOT SUFFERED DAMAGE TO THEIR PROPERTIES. THE

COURT ENTERED JUDGMENT ON AUGUST 13, 2009 DISMISSING ALL OF THE PLAINTIFFS

CLAIMS BASED ON THE UNANIMOUS JURY VERDICT IN FAVOR OF THE COMPANY.

IN JULY 2009,

THE EMERALD COAST UTILITIES AUTHORITY IN FLORIDA FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE

COMPANY, E.I. DUPONT DE NEMOURS AND COMPANY, SOLUTIA, INC., AND FIRE RAM

INTERNATIONAL, INC. IN THE ESCAMBIA COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT ALLEGING

CONTAMINATION OF PUBLIC DRINKING WATER WELLS FROM PFOA AND PFOS AND SEEKING TO

RECOVER COSTS RELATED TO INVESTIGATION, TREATMENT, REMEDIATION AND MONITORING

OF ALLEGED PFOA AND PFOS CONTAMINATION OF ITS WELLS. THE COMPANY, JOINED BY THE

OTHER DEFENDANTS, REMOVED THE LAWSUIT TO THE U. S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE

NORTHERN DISTRICT OF FLORIDA. ON NOVEMBER 19, 2009 THE DISTRICT COURT

DENIED THE PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO REMAND THE CASE TO STATE COURT, FINDING THAT

PLAINTIFFS JOINDER OF THE ONLY FLORIDA DEFENDANT, FIRE RAM INTERNATIONAL, INC.,

WAS FRAUDULENT. THE DISTRICT COURT SUBSEQUENTLY DENIED THE PLAINTIFFS MOTION

FOR LEAVE TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT ON GROUNDS OF TIMELINESS.

IN JUNE 2009,

THE COMPANY, ALONG WITH MORE THAN 250 OTHER COMPANIES, WAS SERVED WITH A

THIRD-PARTY COMPLAINT SEEKING CONTRIBUTION TOWARDS THE COST OF CLEANING UP A

17-MILE STRETCH OF THE PASSAIC RIVER IN NEW JERSEY. AFTER COMMENCING AN

ENFORCEMENT ACTION IN 1990, THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY FILED SUIT AGAINST MAXUS

ENERGY, TIERRA SOLUTIONS, OCCIDENTAL CHEMICAL AND TWO OTHER COMPANIES SEEKING

CLEANUP AND REMOVAL COSTS AND OTHER DAMAGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PRESENCE OF DIOXIN

AND OTHER HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES IN THE SEDIMENT OF THE PASSAIC. THE THIRD-PARTY

COMPLAINT SEEKS TO SPREAD THOSE COSTS AMONG THE THIRD-PARTY DEFENDANTS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY. BASED ON THE CLEANUP REMEDY CURRENTLY PROPOSED BY THE

EPA, THE TOTAL COSTS AT ISSUE COULD EASILY EXCEED $1 BILLION. THE COMPANYS

RECENT INVOLVEMENT IN THE CASE APPEARS TO RELATE TO ITS PAST DISPOSAL OF

INDUSTRIAL WASTE AT TWO COMMERCIAL WASTE DISPOSAL FACILITIES IN NEW JERSEY.

WHETHER, AND TO WHAT EXTENT, THE COMPANY MAY BE REQUIRED TO CONTRIBUTE TO THE

COSTS AT ISSUE IN THE CASE REMAINS TO BE DETERMINED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT YET

HAVE A BASIS FOR ESTIMATING ITS POTENTIAL EXPOSURE IN THIS CASE, ALTHOUGH THE

COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES ITS ALLOCABLE SHARE, IF ANY, OF THE TOTAL COSTS IS LIKELY

TO BE A FRACTION OF ONE PERCENT.

ACCRUED

LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY

COMPLIES WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF ASC 450,

CONTINGENCIES

,

AND RELATED GUIDANCE, AND RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THOSE

INSTANCES WHERE IT CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS AND WHERE

LIABILITY IS PROBABLE. WHERE THE REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABLE LOSS IS A

RANGE, THE COMPANY RECORDS THE MOST LIKELY ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS, OR THE LOW END

OF THE RANGE IF THERE IS NO ONE BEST ESTIMATE. THE COMPANY EITHER DISCLOSES THE

AMOUNT OF A POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF ESTABLISHED RESERVES IF

ESTIMABLE, OR STATES THAT SUCH AN ESTIMATE CANNOT BE MADE. FOR THOSE INSURED

MATTERS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN A RESERVE, THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS

RECEIVABLES FOR THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE THAT IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER UNDER THE

COMPANYS INSURANCE PROGRAM. FOR THOSE INSURED MATTERS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS

NOT TAKEN A RESERVE BECAUSE THE LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR THE AMOUNT OF THE

LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, BUT WHERE THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED AN

EXPENSE IN DEFENDING ITSELF, THE COMPANY RECORDS RECEIVABLES FOR THE AMOUNT OF

INSURANCE THAT IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER FOR THE EXPENSE INCURRED. THE COMPANY

DISCLOSES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS EVEN WHERE LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR

THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, IF THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED.

BECAUSE LITIGATION

IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS OR DEVELOPMENTS

COULD OCCUR, THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT THE COMPANY MAY NOT ULTIMATELY

INCUR CHARGES IN EXCESS OF PRESENTLY RECORDED LIABILITIES. A FUTURE ADVERSE

RULING, SETTLEMENT, OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES

THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECORDED. THE COMPANY

CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT SUCH FUTURE CHARGES, IF ANY, WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY, TAKING

INTO ACCOUNT ITS SIGNIFICANT AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE. BASED ON EXPERIENCE

AND DEVELOPMENTS, THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REEXAMINES ITS ESTIMATES OF PROBABLE

LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED EXPENSES AND RECEIVABLES, AND WHETHER IT IS ABLE TO

ESTIMATE A LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED TO BE NOT ESTIMABLE AND/OR NOT

PROBABLE. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANY MAKES ADDITIONS TO OR ADJUSTMENTS OF

ITS ESTIMATED LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, THE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF THE POTENTIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY

COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY

ESTIMATES INSURANCE RECEIVABLES BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ITS NUMEROUS POLICIES,

INCLUDING THEIR EXCLUSIONS, PERTINENT CASE LAW INTERPRETING COMPARABLE

POLICIES, ITS EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR CLAIMS, AND ASSESSMENT OF THE NATURE OF

THE CLAIM, AND RECORDS AN AMOUNT IT HAS CONCLUDED IS LIKELY TO BE RECOVERED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS

THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF ON-GOING LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND

OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE

ITS PROBABLE LIABILITY AND FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN RESERVES AND THE

RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

TABLE

OF CONTENTS

COMPANY DOES NOT

BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY SINGLE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE RESPIRATOR/MASK/ASBESTOS

LIABILITY, THE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION OR THE OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES

SHOWN ABOVE, NOR THAT IT CAN RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OR RANGE OF AMOUNTS

BY WHICH THOSE LIABILITIES MAY EXCEED THE RESERVES THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED.

RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES, INCLUDING THE COST TO RESOLVE THE CLAIM AND DEFENSE

COSTS, BY EXAMINING: (I) THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING CLAIMS, (II) APPARENT

TRENDS, (III) THE APPARENT QUALITY OF CLAIMS (

E.G.,

WHETHER THE CLAIM HAS BEEN ASSERTED ON BEHALF OF ASYMPTOMATIC CLAIMANTS), (IV) CHANGES

IN THE NATURE AND MIX OF CLAIMS (

E.G.,

THE

PROPORTION OF CLAIMS ASSERTING USAGE OF THE COMPANYS MASK OR RESPIRATOR

PRODUCTS AND ALLEGING EXPOSURE TO EACH OF ASBESTOS, SILICA, COAL OR OTHER

OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS, AND CLAIMS PLEADING USE OF ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCTS

ALLEGEDLY MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY), (V) THE NUMBER OF CURRENT CLAIMS

AND A PROJECTION OF THE NUMBER OF FUTURE ASBESTOS AND OTHER CLAIMS THAT MAY BE

FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY, (VI) THE COST TO RESOLVE RECENTLY SETTLED

CLAIMS, AND (VII) AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST TO RESOLVE AND DEFEND AGAINST

CURRENT AND FUTURE CLAIMS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN PROJECTING THE

NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ASSERTED, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO

THE COMPANYS RESPIRATORY PRODUCTS THAT THEMSELVES DID NOT CONTAIN ANY HARMFUL

MATERIALS (WHICH MAKES THE VARIOUS PUBLISHED STUDIES THAT PURPORT TO PROJECT

FUTURE ASBESTOS CLAIMS SUBSTANTIALLY REMOVED FROM THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL

EXPERIENCE AND WHICH THEMSELVES VARY WIDELY), THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT

THERE IS ANY SINGLE BEST ESTIMATE OF THIS LIABILITY, NOR THAT IT CAN RELIABLY

ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OR RANGE OF AMOUNTS BY WHICH THE LIABILITY MAY EXCEED THE

RESERVE THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED. NO LIABILITY HAS BEEN RECORDED REGARDING

THE PENDING ACTION BROUGHT BY THE WEST VIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL PREVIOUSLY

DESCRIBED.

DEVELOPMENTS MAY OCCUR

THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ITS LIABILITIES. THESE DEVELOPMENTS

INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN (I) THE NUMBER OF

FUTURE CLAIMS, (II) THE AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS, (III) THE

LEGAL COSTS OF DEFENDING THESE CLAIMS AND IN MAINTAINING TRIAL READINESS, (IV) CHANGES

IN THE MIX AND NATURE OF CLAIMS RECEIVED, (V) TRIAL AND APPELLATE

OUTCOMES, (VI) CHANGES IN THE LAW AND PROCEDURE APPLICABLE TO THESE

CLAIMS, AND (VII) THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER CO-DEFENDANTS AND

INSURERS.

AS A RESULT OF THE COSTS

OF AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDING ITSELF AND THE GREATER COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS OF

PERSONS WITH MALIGNANT CONDITIONS, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS RESERVES IN 2009

FOR RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES BY $33 MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE COMPANY HAD RESERVES FOR RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES OF $104

MILLION (EXCLUDING AEARO RESERVES).

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE COMPANYS RECEIVABLE FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO THE

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION WAS $143 MILLION. THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS

RECEIVABLES FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES BY $7 MILLION IN 2009 RELATED TO THIS

LITIGATION. AS A RESULT OF SETTLEMENTS REACHED WITH ITS INSURERS, THE COMPANY

WAS PAID APPROXIMATELY $57 MILLION IN 2009 AND HAS AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE TO

RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL $28 MILLION IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION.

VARIOUS FACTORS

COULD AFFECT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF RECOVERY OF THIS RECEIVABLE, INCLUDING (I) DELAYS

IN OR AVOIDANCE OF PAYMENT BY INSURERS; (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH INSURERS

MAY BECOME INSOLVENT IN THE FUTURE, AND (III) THE OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS

WITH INSURERS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS

LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ACCRUED LIABILITY AND

INSURANCE RECEIVABLE REPRESENTS IN PART THE TIME DELAY BETWEEN PAYMENT OF

CLAIMS ON THE ONE HAND AND RECEIPT OF INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENTS ON THE OTHER

HAND. BECAUSE OF THE LAG TIME BETWEEN SETTLEMENT AND PAYMENT OF A CLAIM, NO

MEANINGFUL CONCLUSIONS MAY BE DRAWN FROM QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL CHANGES IN THE

AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES FOR EXPECTED INSURANCE RECOVERIES OR CHANGES IN THE

NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS.

ON JANUARY 5,

2007 THE COMPANY WAS SERVED WITH A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION FILED ON BEHALF

OF TWO OF ITS INSURERS (CONTINENTAL CASUALTY AND CONTINENTAL INSURANCE CO. 

BOTH PART OF THE CONTINENTAL CASUALTY GROUP) DISCLAIMING COVERAGE FOR

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS CLAIMS. THESE INSURERS REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY $14

MILLION OF THE $143 MILLION INSURANCE RECOVERY RECEIVABLE REFERENCED IN THE

ABOVE TABLE. THE ACTION SEEKS DECLARATORY JUDGMENT REGARDING THE ALLOCATION OF

COVERED COSTS AMONG THE POLICIES ISSUED BY THE VARIOUS INSURERS. IT WAS FILED

IN HENNEPIN COUNTY, MINNESOTA AND NAMED, IN ADDITION TO THE COMPANY, OVER 60 OF

THE COMPANYS INSURERS. THIS ACTION IS SIMILAR IN NATURE TO AN ACTION FILED IN

1994 WITH RESPECT TO BREAST IMPLANT COVERAGE, WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN THE

MINNESOTA SUPREME COURTS RULING OF 2003 THAT WAS LARGELY IN THE COMPANYS FAVOR.

AT THE COMPANYS REQUEST, THE CASE WAS TRANSFERRED TO RAMSEY COUNTY, OVER THE

OBJECTIONS OF THE INSURERS. THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT HEARD ORAL ARGUMENT OF

THE INSURERS APPEAL OF THAT DECISION IN MARCH 2008 AND RULED IN MAY 2008

THAT THE PROPER VENUE OF THAT CASE IS RAMSEY COUNTY. THE CASE HAS BEEN ASSIGNED

TO A JUDGE IN RAMSEY COUNTY DISTRICT COURT. THE PLAINTIFF INSURERS HAVE SERVED

AN AMENDED COMPLAINT THAT NAMES SOME ADDITIONAL INSURERS AND DELETES OTHERS.

SEVERAL OF THE INSURER DEFENDANTS NAMED IN THE AMENDED COMPLAINT HAVE BEEN

DISMISSED BECAUSE OF SETTLEMENTS THEY HAVE REACHED WITH 3M REGARDING THE

MATTERS AT ISSUE IN THE LAWSUIT. THE CASE REMAINS IN ITS EARLY STAGES WITH A

TRIAL SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN JUNE, 2012.

ENVIRONMENTAL

AND OTHER LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE COMPANY

HAD RECORDED LIABILITIES OF $31 MILLION FOR ESTIMATED ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

COSTS BASED UPON AN EVALUATION OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FACTS WITH RESPECT TO

EACH INDIVIDUAL SITE AND ALSO RECORDED RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES OF $15

MILLION. THE COMPANY RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION COSTS ON AN

UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY

NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT

TO A PLAN OF ACTION. LIABILITIES FOR ESTIMATED COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION, DEPENDING ON THE SITE, ARE BASED PRIMARILY UPON INTERNAL OR

THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, AND ESTIMATES AS TO THE NUMBER,

PARTICIPATION LEVEL AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF ANY OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE

PARTIES, THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION AND THE NATURE OF REQUIRED REMEDIAL

ACTIONS. THE COMPANY ADJUSTS RECORDED LIABILITIES AS FURTHER INFORMATION

DEVELOPS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT IT WILL PAY THE

AMOUNTS RECORDED OVER THE PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE APPLICABLE SITES,

CURRENTLY RANGING UP TO 30 YEARS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2009, THE COMPANY HAD RECORDED LIABILITIES OF $117 MILLION FOR ESTIMATED OTHER

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES BASED UPON AN EVALUATION OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FACTS

FOR ADDRESSING TRACE AMOUNTS OF PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS IN DRINKING WATER

SOURCES IN THE CITY OF OAKDALE AND LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA, AS WELL AS PRESENCE IN

THE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER AT THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN DECATUR,

ALABAMA, AND COTTAGE GROVE, MINNESOTA, AND AT TWO FORMER DISPOSAL SITES IN MINNESOTA.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT MOST OF THE SPENDING WILL OCCUR OVER THE NEXT SEVEN

YEARS.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO

ESTIMATE THE COST OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND REMEDIATION GIVEN THE

UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE EXTENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND THE

EXISTENCE OF ALTERNATE CLEANUP METHODS. DEVELOPMENTS MAY OCCUR THAT COULD

AFFECT THE COMPANYS CURRENT ASSESSMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (I) CHANGES

IN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS; (II) CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS,

CHANGES IN PERMISSIBLE LEVELS OF SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES,

OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT THEORIES AND POLICIES, INCLUDING EFFORTS TO RECOVER

NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES; (III) NEW AND EVOLVING ANALYTICAL AND

REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES; (IV) SUCCESS IN ALLOCATING LIABILITY TO OTHER

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES; AND (V) THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND THIRD-PARTY INDEMNITORS.

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND STOCK

OWNERSHIP PLANS

THE

COMPANY SPONSORS EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS UNDER SECTION 401(K) OF THE

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THESE PLANS ARE OFFERED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL REGULAR

U.S. EMPLOYEES. DURING 2008 THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED VARIOUS CHANGES TO

THE EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS. FOR EMPLOYEES HIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2009,

EMPLOYEE 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS OF UP TO 6% OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION ARE

MATCHED IN COMPANY STOCK AT RATES OF 60% OR 75%, DEPENDING ON THE PLAN THE

EMPLOYEE PARTICIPATED IN. EMPLOYEES HIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009

RECEIVE A CASH MATCH OF 100% FOR EMPLOYEE 401(K) CONTRIBUTIONS OF UP TO 6%

OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION AND ALSO RECEIVE AN EMPLOYER RETIREMENT INCOME ACCOUNT

CASH CONTRIBUTION OF 3% OF THE PARTICIPANTS TOTAL ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION. ALL

EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE INVESTED IN A NUMBER OF INVESTMENT FUNDS PURSUANT TO

THEIR ELECTIONS. VESTED EMPLOYEES MAY DIVERSIFY THEIR 3M SHARES INTO OTHER

INVESTMENT OPTIONS. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2010, THE MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS

FOR ALL PARTICIPANTS WILL BE MADE IN CASH.

THE

COMPANY MAINTAINED AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP) THAT WAS ESTABLISHED

IN 1989 AS A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OF FUNDING THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS

CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER 401(K) EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS. TOTAL ESOP SHARES WERE

CONSIDERED TO BE SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS. THE

ESOP DEBT OBLIGATION MATURED IN 2009 (NOTE 10).

DIVIDENDS ON SHARES HELD BY THE ESOP WERE PAID TO THE ESOP

TRUST AND, TOGETHER WITH COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS, WERE USED BY THE ESOP TO REPAY

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON THE OUTSTANDING ESOP DEBT. THE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO

DIVIDENDS PAID ON UNALLOCATED SHARES WAS CHARGED DIRECTLY TO EQUITY AND TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $1 MILLION IN 2009, $2 MILLION IN 2008, AND $3 MILLION IN

2007. OVER THE LIFE OF THE ESOP DEBT, SHARES WERE RELEASED FOR ALLOCATION TO

PARTICIPANTS BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT YEARS DEBT SERVICE TO THE

REMAINING DEBT SERVICE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT PAYMENT.

UNTIL

2009, THE ESOP WAS THE PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE

SAVINGS PLANS. AS PERMITTED BY ACCOUNTING STANDARDS RELATING TO EMPLOYERS

ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS, THE DEBT OF THE ESOP WAS

RECORDED AS DEBT, AND SHARES PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL WERE REPORTED AS UNEARNED

COMPENSATION IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

CHANGES IN EQUITY. UNEARNED COMPENSATION WAS REDUCED SYMMETRICALLY AS THE ESOP

MADE PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON THE DEBT. EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ESOP INCLUDED

TOTAL DEBT SERVICE ON THE NOTES, LESS DIVIDENDS. THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTED

TREASURY SHARES (ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE) AND CASH (IN 2009) TO EMPLOYEE

SAVINGS PLANS TO COVER OBLIGATIONS NOT FUNDED BY THE ESOP (REPORTED AS AN

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE).

NOTE 16.  STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

IN

MAY 2008, SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED 35 MILLION SHARES FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 3M

2008 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, WHICH REPLACED AND SUCCEEDED THE 2005

MANAGEMENT STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM (MSOP), THE 3M PERFORMANCE UNIT PLAN, AND

THE 1992 DIRECTORS STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM. SHARES UNDER THIS PLAN MAY BE

ISSUED IN THE FORM OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS,

PROGRESSIVE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK,

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OTHER STOCK AWARDS, AND PERFORMANCE UNITS AND

PERFORMANCE SHARES. AWARDS DENOMINATED IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OTHER THAN

OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, PER THE 2008 PLAN, WILL BE COUNTED

AGAINST THE 35 MILLION SHARE LIMIT AS 3.38 SHARES FOR EVERY ONE SHARE COVERED

BY SUCH AWARD. THE REMAINING TOTAL SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE 3M 2008

LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN ARE 15,507,162 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

IN 2009, THE COMPANY CHANGED

THE TIMING OF ITS ANNUAL STOCK OPTION AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT DATES

FROM MAY TO FEBRUARY, IN ORDER TO PROVIDE A STRONGER AND MORE IMMEDIATE

LINK BETWEEN THE PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUALS DURING THE PRECEDING YEAR AND THE

SIZE OF THEIR ANNUAL STOCK OPTION GRANTS. IN 2008 AND PRIOR, THE COMPANY ISSUED

OPTIONS TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES ANNUALLY IN MAY USING THE CLOSING STOCK

PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE, WHICH WAS THE DATE OF THE ANNUAL STOCKHOLDERS

MEETING. ACCOUNTING RULES REQUIRE RECOGNITION OF EXPENSE UNDER A

NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING PERIOD APPROACH, REQUIRING COMPENSATION EXPENSE

RECOGNITION WHEN AN EMPLOYEE IS ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE. 3M EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED

STATES ARE ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE AT AGE 55 AND AFTER HAVING COMPLETED FIVE YEARS

OF SERVICE. APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT OF THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARD

EXPENSE DOLLARS ARE FOR THIS RETIREE-ELIGIBLE POPULATION. THEREFORE, IN 2009

THE RETIREE-ELIGIBLE IMPACT SHIFTED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO THE

FIRST QUARTER, WHEREAS IN 2008 AND PRIOR THIS IMPACT WAS RECOGNIZED IN THE

SECOND QUARTER (BECAUSE OF THE MAY GRANT DATE).

IN

ADDITION TO THESE ANNUAL GRANTS, THE COMPANY MAKES OTHER MINOR GRANTS OF STOCK

OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED GRANTS. THE COMPANY

ISSUES CASH SETTLED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS IN

CERTAIN COUNTRIES. THESE GRANTS DO NOT RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK

AND ARE CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL BY THE COMPANY. THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 14,008

PARTICIPANTS WITH OUTSTANDING OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, OR RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009.

EFFECTIVE

WITH THE MAY 2005 MSOP ANNUAL GRANT, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS VESTING

PERIOD FROM ONE TO THREE YEARS WITH THE EXPIRATION DATE REMAINING AT 10 YEARS

FROM DATE OF GRANT. BEGINNING IN 2007, THE COMPANY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF

TRADITIONAL STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE MSOP PLAN BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF

EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ANNUAL GRANTS AND BY SHIFTING A PORTION OF THE

ANNUAL GRANT AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL STOCK OPTIONS PRIMARILY TO RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS. HOWEVER, ASSOCIATED WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES, THE COMPANY PROVIDED A ONE-TIME BUYOUT GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS TO THE IMPACTED EMPLOYEES, WHICH RESULTED IN INCREASED STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN 2007. THE INCOME TAX BENEFITS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING

TABLE CAN FLUCTUATE BY PERIOD DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS

(ISOS) EXERCISED SINCE THE COMPANY RECEIVES THE ISOS TAX BENEFIT UPON EXERCISE.

THE COMPANY LAST GRANTED ISOS IN 2002. AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, WHICH INCLUDE

STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND THE GENERAL

EMPLOYEES STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (GESPP), ARE AS FOLLOWS.

SHARES UNDER OPTION INCLUDE GRANTS FROM PREVIOUS PLANS. FOR OPTIONS OUTSTANDING

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL LIFE WAS

58 MONTHS AND THE AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE WAS $844 MILLION. FOR OPTIONS

EXERCISABLE AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING

CONTRACTUAL LIFE WAS 50 MONTHS AND THE AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE WAS $636

MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THERE WAS $68 MILLION OF COMPENSATION

EXPENSE THAT HAS YET TO BE RECOGNIZED RELATED TO NON-VESTED STOCK OPTION-BASED

AWARDS. THIS EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING VESTING

PERIOD WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIFE OF 1.7 YEARS.

THE

TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUES OF STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007,

RESPECTIVELY, WAS $108 MILLION, $107 MILLION AND $373 MILLION. CASH RECEIVED

FROM OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, WAS $345

MILLION, $188 MILLION AND $692 MILLION. THE COMPANYS ACTUAL TAX BENEFITS

REALIZED FOR THE TAX DEDUCTIONS RELATED TO THE EXERCISE OF EMPLOYEE STOCK

OPTIONS FOR 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY, WAS $38 MILLION, $34 MILLION AND

$122 MILLION. CAPITALIZED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AMOUNTS WERE NOT MATERIAL

FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED 2009, 2008, AND 2007.

THE

COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC POLICY TO REPURCHASE COMMON SHARES TO MITIGATE

THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF OPTIONS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY MADE

ADEQUATE DISCRETIONARY PURCHASES, BASED ON CASH AVAILABILITY, MARKET TRENDS AND

OTHER FACTORS, TO SATISFY STOCK OPTION EXERCISE ACTIVITY.

FOR

ANNUAL AND PROGRESSIVE (RELOAD) OPTIONS, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE AT THE

EXPECTED

VOLATILITY IS A STATISTICAL MEASURE OF THE AMOUNT BY WHICH A STOCK PRICE IS

EXPECTED TO FLUCTUATE DURING A PERIOD. FOR THE 2009, 2008 AND 2007 ANNUAL GRANT

DATE, THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY BASED UPON THE AVERAGE OF

THE MOST RECENT ONE YEAR VOLATILITY, THE MEDIAN OF THE TERM OF THE EXPECTED

LIFE ROLLING VOLATILITY, THE MEDIAN OF THE MOST RECENT TERM OF THE EXPECTED

LIFE VOLATILITY OF 3M STOCK, AND THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY ON THE GRANT DATE. THE

EXPECTED TERM ASSUMPTION IS BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF HISTORICAL GRANTS.

NOTE 17.  BUSINESS SEGMENTS

EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2009, 3M MADE CERTAIN CHANGES TO ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN ITS

CONTINUING EFFORT TO DRIVE GROWTH BY ALIGNING BUSINESSES AROUND MARKETS AND

CUSTOMERS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE CHANGES ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

·

CERTAIN 3M WINDOW FILMS, SUCH AS 3M SCOTCHTINT

WINDOW FILM FOR BUILDINGS AND 3M ULTRA SAFETY AND SECURITY WINDOW FILM FOR

PROPERTY AND PERSONAL PROTECTION DURING DESTRUCTIVE WEATHER CONDITIONS, WERE

PREVIOUSLY PART OF THE BUILDING AND COMMERCIAL SERVICES DIVISION WITHIN THE

SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENT. THESE WINDOW FILMS

WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE NEWLY CREATED RENEWABLE ENERGY DIVISION, WHICH IS PART

OF THE INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS SEGMENT. THE RENEWABLE ENERGY

DIVISION CONSISTS OF CURRENT 3M SOLAR ENERGY CREATION AND MANAGEMENT PRODUCTS

AND SOLUTIONS, AS WELL AS PRODUCTS FOCUSED ON THE RENEWABLE ENERGY MARKETS.

RENEWABLE ENERGYS PORTFOLIO INCLUDES VARIOUS 3M PRODUCTS FOR SOLAR ENERGY

PRODUCTION AND SOLAR ENERGY MANAGEMENT (SUCH AS WINDOW FILMS) AND ALSO INCLUDES

RESPONSIBILITY FOR WIND, GEOTHERMAL AND BIOFUEL-ORIENTED PRODUCTS. THE

PRECEDING PRODUCT MOVES RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR TOTAL YEAR

2008 OF $152 MILLION FOR INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION, WHICH WAS OFFSET BY A

CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION

SERVICES.

·

3M ACQUIRED AEARO HOLDING CORP., THE PARENT COMPANY OF AEARO

TECHNOLOGIES INC. (HEREAFTER REFERRED TO AS AEARO), IN APRIL 2008. AEARO

MANUFACTURES AND SELLS PERSONAL PROTECTION AND ENERGY ABSORBING PRODUCTS

THROUGH THE INDUSTRIAL RETAIL CHANNELS AND CERTAIN SAFETY PRODUCTS THROUGH THE

CONSUMER RETAIL CHANNELS. THE CONSUMER RETAIL PORTION OF AEAROS BUSINESS

MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS PERSONAL SAFETY PRODUCTS (INCLUDING HEAD, EYE, FACE

AND HEARING PRODUCTS, REFLECTIVE VESTS, PROTECTIVE COVERALLS, AND FIRST AID

KITS) TO THE DO-IT-YOURSELF CONSUMER RETAIL MARKETS. THE DO-IT-YOURSELF RETAIL

MARKET PORTION OF 3MS AEARO BUSINESS (PREVIOUSLY IN THE OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH

AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY DIVISION WITHIN THE SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION

SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENT) WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND HOME

IMPROVEMENT DIVISION WITHIN THE CONSUMER AND OFFICE BUSINESS SEGMENT. THE

PRECEDING PRODUCT MOVES RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN NET SALES FOR TOTAL YEAR

2008 OF $49 MILLION FOR CONSUMER AND OFFICE, WHICH WAS OFFSET BY A

CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN NET SALES FOR SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION

SERVICES.

ALSO, DURING THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2009, 3M CHANGED ITS SEGMENT REPORTING MEASURES TO INCLUDE DUAL

CREDIT TO BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR CERTAIN U.S. SALES AND RELATED OPERATING

INCOME. MANAGEMENT NOW EVALUATES EACH OF ITS SIX OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS

BASED ON NET SALES AND OPERATING INCOME PERFORMANCE, INCLUDING DUAL CREDIT U.S.

REPORTING. THIS CHANGE WAS MADE TO FURTHER INCENTIVIZE U.S. SALES GROWTH. AS A

RESULT, 3M NOW PROVIDES ADDITIONAL (DUAL) CREDIT TO THOSE BUSINESS SEGMENTS

SELLING PRODUCTS IN THE U.S. TO AN EXTERNAL CUSTOMER WHEN THAT SEGMENT IS NOT

THE PRIMARY SELLER OF THE PRODUCT. FOR EXAMPLE, CERTAIN RESPIRATORS ARE

PRIMARILY SOLD BY THE OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY DIVISION

WITHIN THE SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES BUSINESS SEGMENT; HOWEVER,

THE INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS SEGMENT ALSO SELLS THIS PRODUCT TO

CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN ITS U.S. MARKETS. IN THIS EXAMPLE, THE NON-PRIMARY SELLING

SEGMENT (INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION) WOULD ALSO RECEIVE CREDIT FOR THE

ASSOCIATED NET SALES IT INITIATED AND THE RELATED APPROXIMATE OPERATING INCOME.

THE ASSIGNED OPERATING INCOME RELATED TO DUAL CREDIT ACTIVITY MAY DIFFER FROM

OPERATING INCOME THAT WOULD RESULT FROM ACTUAL COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH

SALES. THE OFFSET TO THE DUAL CREDIT BUSINESS SEGMENT REPORTING IS REFLECTED AS

A RECONCILING ITEM ENTITLED ELIMINATION OF DUAL CREDIT, SUCH THAT SALES AND

OPERATING INCOME FOR THE U.S. IN TOTAL ARE UNCHANGED.

3MS BUSINESSES ARE

ORGANIZED, MANAGED AND INTERNALLY GROUPED INTO SEGMENTS BASED ON DIFFERENCES IN

PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES. 3M CONTINUES TO MANAGE ITS OPERATIONS IN

SIX OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS: INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION; HEALTH CARE;

CONSUMER AND OFFICE; SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; DISPLAY AND

GRAPHICS; AND ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS. 3MS SIX BUSINESS SEGMENTS BRING

TOGETHER COMMON OR RELATED 3M TECHNOLOGIES, ENHANCING THE DEVELOPMENT OF

INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND PROVIDING FOR EFFICIENT SHARING OF

BUSINESS RESOURCES. THESE SEGMENTS HAVE WORLDWIDE RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIRTUALLY

ALL 3M PRODUCT LINES. 3M IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE PRODUCT/SERVICE OR

MARKET. CERTAIN SMALL BUSINESSES AND LAB-SPONSORED PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS

CORPORATE ASSETS AND EXPENSES, ARE NOT ATTRIBUTED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

TRANSACTIONS AMONG REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE RECORDED AT COST.

THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION

PRESENTED HEREIN REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF ALL OF THE PRECEDING SEGMENT STRUCTURE

CHANGES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

3M IS AN INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE CHARACTERIZED BY

SUBSTANTIAL INTERSEGMENT COOPERATION, COST ALLOCATIONS AND INVENTORY TRANSFERS.

THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT REPRESENT THAT ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS, IF

OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY, WOULD REPORT THE OPERATING INCOME AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION

SHOWN. SEGMENT OPERATING INCOME AND ASSETS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE INCLUDE

ALLOCATIONS RESULTING FROM THE SHARED UTILIZATION OF CERTAIN CORPORATE OR

OTHERWISE UNALLOCATED ASSETS. HOWEVER, THE SEPARATE AMOUNTS STATED FOR SEGMENT

DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE BASED ON SECONDARY

PERFORMANCE MEASURES USED BY MANAGEMENT THAT DO NOT INCLUDE ALLOCATIONS OF

CERTAIN CORPORATE ITEMS.

SEGMENT

ASSETS FOR THE OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS (EXCLUDING CORPORATE AND

UNALLOCATED) PRIMARILY INCLUDE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE; INVENTORY; PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT  NET; GOODWILL

AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS; AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS ASSETS. ASSETS INCLUDED IN

CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED PRINCIPALLY ARE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE

SECURITIES; INSURANCE RECEIVABLES; DEFERRED INCOME TAXES; CERTAIN INVESTMENTS

AND OTHER ASSETS, INCLUDING PREPAID PENSION ASSETS. CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED

ASSETS CAN CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO CHANGES IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS

AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES, CHANGES IN PREPAID PENSION BENEFITS, AND CHANGES IN

OTHER UNALLOCATED ASSET CATEGORIES.

THE

MOST SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IMPACTING 2009 AND 2008 RESULTS WERE RESTRUCTURING

ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IMPACTING 2007 RESULTS

ARE THE NET GAIN ON SALE OF THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS (WITHIN THE HEALTH

CARE SEGMENT) AND RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ACTIONS. REFER TO NOTE 4 FOR
