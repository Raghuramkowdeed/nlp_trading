3M COMPANY

FORM 10-K

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002

PART I

ITEM 1. BUSINESS.

3M COMPANY, FORMERLY KNOWN AS MINNESOTA MINING AND MANUFACTURING COMPANY, WAS

INCORPORATED IN 1929 UNDER THE LAWS OF THE STATE OF DELAWARE TO CONTINUE

OPERATIONS, BEGUN IN 1902.  THE BOARD OF "MINNESOTA MINING AND MANUFACTURING

COMPANY" APPROVED CHANGING THE COMPANY'S NAME EFFECTIVE APRIL 8, 2002, TO "3M

GENERAL

3M IS A DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL COMPANY WITH A MARKET PRESENCE IN HEALTH CARE,

SAFETY, ELECTRONICS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, INDUSTRIAL, CONSUMER AND OFFICE, AND

OTHER MARKETS. 3M IS AN INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE CHARACTERIZED BY SUBSTANTIAL

INTERCOMPANY COOPERATION IN RESEARCH, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS.

3M'S BUSINESS HAS DEVELOPED FROM ITS RESEARCH AND TECHNOLOGY IN COATING AND

BONDING FOR COATED ABRASIVES, THE COMPANY'S ORIGINAL PRODUCT.  COATING AND

BONDING IS THE PROCESS OF APPLYING ONE MATERIAL TO ANOTHER, SUCH AS ABRASIVE

GRANULES TO PAPER OR CLOTH (COATED ABRASIVES), ADHESIVES TO A BACKING

(PRESSURE-SENSITIVE TAPES), CERAMIC COATING TO GRANULAR MINERAL (ROOFING

GRANULES), GLASS BEADS TO PLASTIC BACKING (REFLECTIVE SHEETING), AND LOW-TACK

ADHESIVES TO PAPER (REPOSITIONABLE NOTES).

3M IS AMONG THE LEADING MANUFACTURERS OF PRODUCTS FOR MANY OF THE MARKETS IT

SERVES. IN ALL CASES, 3M PRODUCTS ARE SUBJECT TO DIRECT OR INDIRECT

COMPETITION.  MOST 3M PRODUCTS INVOLVE EXPERTISE IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT,

MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING, AND ARE SUBJECT TO COMPETITION FROM PRODUCTS

MANUFACTURED AND SOLD BY OTHER TECHNICALLY ORIENTED COMPANIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY EMPLOYED 68,774 PEOPLE.

DISTRIBUTION

3M PRODUCTS ARE SOLD THROUGH NUMEROUS DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS. PRODUCTS ARE SOLD

DIRECTLY TO USERS AND THROUGH NUMEROUS WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS, JOBBERS,

DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS IN A WIDE VARIETY OF TRADES IN MANY COUNTRIES AROUND

THE WORLD.  MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE CONFIDENCE OF WHOLESALERS, RETAILERS,

JOBBERS, DISTRIBUTORS AND DEALERS IN 3M AND ITS PRODUCTS, DEVELOPED THROUGH

LONG ASSOCIATION WITH SKILLED MARKETING AND SALES REPRESENTATIVES, HAS

CONTRIBUTED SIGNIFICANTLY TO 3M'S POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND TO ITS

GROWTH.  3M HAS 214 SALES OFFICES WORLDWIDE, INCLUDING 18 SALES OFFICES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND 196 SALES OFFICES INTERNATIONALLY.

4

RESEARCH, PATENTS AND RAW MATERIALS

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CONSTITUTE AN IMPORTANT PART OF 3M'S

ACTIVITIES. PRODUCTS RESULTING FROM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAVE BEEN A MAJOR

DRIVER OF 3M'S GROWTH. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES TOTALED

$1.070 BILLION, $1.084 BILLION AND $1.101 BILLION IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000,

RESPECTIVELY. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, COVERING BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND

THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND IMPROVED

PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, TOTALED $738 MILLION, $745 MILLION AND $727 MILLION IN

2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. RELATED EXPENSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TECHNICAL

SUPPORT PROVIDED BY THE LABORATORIES FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS.

CORPORATE RESEARCH LABORATORIES SUPPORT RESEARCH EFFORTS OF DIVISION AND MARKET

LABORATORIES.  THESE CORPORATE LABORATORIES ALSO ENGAGE IN RESEARCH NOT

DIRECTLY RELATED TO EXISTING 3M PRODUCT LINES.  MOST MAJOR OPERATING DIVISIONS

HAVE THEIR OWN LABORATORIES TO IMPROVE EXISTING PRODUCTS AND DEVELOP NEW

PRODUCTS. RESEARCH STAFF GROUPS PROVIDE SPECIALIZED SERVICES IN

INSTRUMENTATION, ENGINEERING AND PROCESS DEVELOPMENT.  3M ALSO MAINTAINS AN

ORGANIZATION FOR TECHNOLOGICAL DEVELOPMENT NOT SPONSORED BY OTHER UNITS OF THE

COMPANY.

3M IS THE OWNER OF MANY DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN PATENTS DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM ITS

RESEARCH ACTIVITIES.  3M'S BUSINESS AS A WHOLE IS NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT UPON

ANY ONE PATENT, LICENSE OR TRADE SECRET, OR UPON ANY GROUP OF RELATED PATENTS,

LICENSES OR TRADE SECRETS.

THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED NO SIGNIFICANT OR UNUSUAL PROBLEMS IN THE PURCHASE OF

RAW MATERIALS DURING 2002.  IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT FUTURE SHORTAGES OF RAW

MATERIALS OR THE IMPACT ANY SUCH SHORTAGES WOULD HAVE.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

MOST OF 3M'S MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS.  3M HAS MADE, AND PLANS TO CONTINUE MAKING NECESSARY

EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS.  3M IS ALSO INVOLVED IN

REMEDIATION ACTIONS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS FROM PAST OPERATIONS AT

CERTAIN SITES (REFER TO PART I, ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS).

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXISTING CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST

OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE REVENUES ARE EXPENSED.

LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN

THEY ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE

COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES OR THE COMPANY'S COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF

ACTION. ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO

CURRENT OR FUTURE OPERATIONS GENERALLY ARE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER

THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.

IN 2002, 3M EXPENDED ABOUT $21 MILLION FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS RELATED TO THE

ENVIRONMENT.  THE COMPARABLE AMOUNT IN 2001 WAS ABOUT $7 MILLION. THESE

AMOUNTS EXCLUDE EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIONS RELATING TO EXISTING

MATTERS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

PURPOSES HAVE INCLUDED POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICES--SUCH AS WASTEWATER TREATMENT

PLANTS, GROUNDWATER MONITORING DEVICES, AIR STRIPPERS OR SEPARATORS, AND

THERMAL OXIDIZERS -- AT NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES CONSTRUCTED OR UPGRADED IN

THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS. CONSISTENT WITH POLICIES STRESSING

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITY, AVERAGE ANNUAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (OTHER THAN

FOR REMEDIATION PROJECTS) ARE PRESENTLY EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $70 MILLION OVER

THE NEXT TWO YEARS FOR NEW OR EXPANDED PROGRAMS TO BUILD FACILITIES OR MODIFY

MANUFACTURING PROCESSES TO MINIMIZE WASTE AND REDUCE EMISSIONS.

WHILE WE CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE FUTURE COSTS OF SUCH CLEAN-UP

ACTIVITIES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

COMPLIANCE, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE CHARACTERIZED BY SUBSTANTIAL INTERSEGMENT COOPERATION

WITH ALLOCATIONS RESULTING FROM THE SHARED UTILIZATION OF ASSETS.

TTEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

GENERAL

-------

THE COMPANY AND SOME OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE NAMED DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF

CLAIMS, LAWSUITS, AND GOVERNMENTAL PROCEEDINGS. THESE INCLUDE PRODUCTS

LIABILITY CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS INVOLVING PRODUCTS THAT THE COMPANY NOW OR

FORMERLY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD, AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS. SOME CLAIMANTS

SEEK DAMAGES AND OTHER RELIEF THAT, IF GRANTED, WOULD REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL

EXPENDITURES.

SOME OF THESE LAWSUITS AND PROCEEDINGS RAISE DIFFICULT AND COMPLEX FACTUAL AND

LEGAL ISSUES, AND ARE SUBJECT TO MANY UNCERTAINTIES, SUCH AS THE FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE PARTICULAR LAWSUIT, THE JURISDICTION AND FORUM IN WHICH

THE LAWSUIT IS PENDING, AND THE APPLICABLE LAW.  THE COMPANY RECORDS

LIABILITIES IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE IT CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF

THE LOSS AND WHERE LIABILITY PROBABLY WILL ARISE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS

RECEIVABLES FOR THE PROBABLE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE THAT IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER

UNDER THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE PROGRAM IN THOSE INSTANCES.

THE COMPANY CANNOT ALWAYS DEFINITIVELY DETERMINE POSSIBLE LIABILITIES THAT

EXCEED RECORDED AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TO WHICH IT IS A

PARTY. THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT THE COMPANY MAY NOT ULTIMATELY INCUR

CHARGES, WHETHER RELATED TO PRODUCTS LIABILITY, ANTITRUST, OR OTHER

LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, OR OTHER ACTIONS, IN EXCESS OF PRESENTLY

RECORDED LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT UNLIKELY, BASED UPON

THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND ITS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF RELEVANT

FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT THE POSSIBLE LIABILITIES EXCEEDING RECORDED

AMOUNTS WOULD BE MATERIAL INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE TO ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS. WITH RESPECT TO

PRODUCTS LIABILITY CLAIMS, SUCH A CONCLUSION ABOUT POSSIBLE LIABILITIES

CONSIDERS INSURANCE COVERAGE AVAILABLE FOR SUCH LIABILITIES.

WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS FROM ANY SUCH FUTURE

CHARGES IS UNLIKELY, GIVEN THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTY OF LITIGATION, A REMOTE

POSSIBILITY EXISTS THAT A FUTURE ADVERSE RULING OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT

COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON

THE COMPANY. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY OF LITIGATION AND IN MAKING FUTURE

PROJECTIONS, THE COMPANY HAS AND WILL CONTINUE TO PERIODICALLY REEXAMINE ITS

ESTIMATES OF PROBABLE LIABILITIES AND ANY ASSOCIATED EXPENSES AND RECEIVABLES

AND MAKE APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS TO SUCH ESTIMATES BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND

DEVELOPMENTS IN THE LITIGATION. AS A RESULT, THE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF THE

POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS DESCRIBED IN "LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS" COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

ANTITRUST LITIGATION

---------------------

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, LEPAGE'S INC. FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST THE COMPANY IN

JUNE 1997 IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF

PENNSYLVANIA ALLEGING THAT CERTAIN MARKETING PRACTICES OF THE COMPANY VIOLATED

THE ANTITRUST LAWS. ON OCTOBER 8, 1999, THE JURY AWARDED LEPAGE'S DAMAGES OF

$22.8 MILLION. THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRE-TAX CHARGE OF $73 MILLION IN THE

THIRD QUARTER OF 1999 RELATED TO THE ADVERSE JURY VERDICT (THE $22.8 MILLION

VERDICT IS AUTOMATICALLY TRIPLED UNDER THE LAW) AND ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS.

IN JANUARY 2002, THE THIRD CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THE TRIAL COURT'S

DECISION AND, AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY REVERSED THE $73 MILLION PRE-TAX

CHARGE. ON FEBRUARY 25, 2002, THE THIRD CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS VACATED ITS

PRIOR RULING AND ORDERED A RE-HEARING BY THE FULL COURT. ORAL ARGUMENT ON THE

APPEAL WAS HEARD ON OCTOBER 30, 2002.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE DECISION OF THE

THIRD CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS DURING THE FIRST OR SECOND QUARTER OF 2003.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE TRIAL COURT JUDGMENT WILL

AGAIN BE OVERTURNED, NO LIABILITY HAS BEEN RECORDED RELATED TO THIS

MATTER AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. IF THE THIRD CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS

AFFIRMS THE TRIAL COURT JUDGMENT, AND THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT

DECLINES TO REVIEW THE CASE, THE COMPANY WOULD INCUR A PRE-TAX

10

CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $85 MILLION RELATED TO THE ADVERSE JURY VERDICT PLUS

INTEREST. 3M WOULD ALSO BE LIABLE FOR LEPAGE'S ATTORNEYS' FEES AND COSTS, AN

AMOUNT THAT HAS NOT YET BEEN DETERMINED BY THE COURT.  AFTER THE VERDICT IN

THE LEPAGE'S ACTION, PURCHASERS OF TRANSPARENT TAPE FILED THREE CLASS ACTION

LAWSUITS AGAINST THE COMPANY IN CALIFORNIA AND PENNSYLVANIA ALLEGING THAT

CERTAIN MARKETING PRACTICES OF THE COMPANY VIOLATED THE STATE OR FEDERAL

ANTITRUST LAWS.  THOSE ACTIONS ARE PENDING.

BREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION

-------------------------

THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OTHER COMPANIES HAVE BEEN NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN A

NUMBER OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS ALLEGING DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES OF

VARIOUS TYPES RESULTING FROM BREAST IMPLANTS FORMERLY MANUFACTURED BY THE

COMPANY OR A RELATED COMPANY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY

HAVE BEEN RESOLVED.  CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY REGISTERED IN THE REVISED

CLASS ACTION SETTLEMENT PROGRAM APPROVED BY THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ALABAMA (THE "REVISED SETTLEMENT PROGRAM") HAVE

BEEN OR WILL BE RESOLVED THROUGH THE REVISED SETTLEMENT PROGRAM. THE COMPANY

HAS CONFIRMED THAT APPROXIMATELY 7 REMAINING CLAIMANTS WHO HAVE OPTED OUT OF

THE REVISED SETTLEMENT PROGRAM HAVE 3M IMPLANTS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER

ITS REMAINING PROBABLE LIABILITY FOR THESE CONFIRMED CASES TO BE MATERIAL.

THE COMPANY'S INSURERS PROVIDING OCCURRENCE-BASED COVERAGE INITIATED A

DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION IN RAMSEY COUNTY MINNESOTA AGAINST THE COMPANY

SEEKING ADJUDICATION OF CERTAIN COVERAGE AND ALLOCATION ISSUES. ON FEBRUARY

24, 2000, THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT FAVORABLE TO THE COMPANY BY REJECTING

ALL OF THE INSURERS' REMAINING DEFENSES TO COVERAGE FOR BREAST IMPLANT

LIABILITIES AND COSTS.

THE TRIAL COURT'S RULINGS IN POST VERDICT MOTIONS WERE GENERALLY FAVORABLE TO

THE COMPANY.  THE COURT AWARDED THE COMPANY PREJUDGMENT INTEREST ON AMOUNTS

OWING BY INSURERS, INCLUDING A PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S REASONABLE ATTORNEYS

FEES IN CONNECTION WITH THE INSURANCE COVERAGE LITIGATION. EXACT AMOUNTS

CANNOT YET BE DETERMINED. THE COURT FILED THE JUDGMENT ON APRIL 16, 2001, AND

ENTERED JUDGMENT ON MAY 16, 2001, THUS SUBSTANTIALLY CONCLUDING THIS MATTER IN

THE TRIAL COURT. THE COMPANY AND SEVERAL INSURERS APPEALED THE JUDGMENT TO THE

MINNESOTA COURT OF APPEALS.  ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2002, THE MINNESOTA COURT OF

APPEALS AFFIRMED IN PART AND REVERSED IN PART THE TRIAL COURT'S JUDGMENT. THE

COURT OF APPEALS CONFIRMED COVERAGE BUT ALLOCATED THE COVERAGE SO AS TO REDUCE

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE AMOUNTS OWING BY INSURERS FOR LOSSES AND DEFENSE

COSTS AS REFLECTED IN THE TRIAL COURT JUDGMENT. THE COURT OF APPEALS ALSO

REVERSED THE COMPANY'S AWARD OF ATTORNEYS' FEES REFERENCED ABOVE. ON DECEMBER

17, 2002, THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT GRANTED THE COMPANY'S PETITION FOR

REVIEW PERMITTING THE COMPANY TO APPEAL THE COURT OF APPEAL'S DECISION. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS LIKELY TO OBTAIN RELIEF IN THE MINNESOTA SUPREME

COURT. IF THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT DOES NOT GRANT RELIEF AS ANTICIPATED,

THE COMPANY COULD BE EFFECTIVELY DEPRIVED OF SIGNIFICANT AND POTENTIALLY

MATERIAL INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR BREAST IMPLANT CLAIMS.

THE COMPANY ALSO INITIATED AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING IN LONDON, ENGLAND, TO

RECOVER INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR SOME OF ITS BREAST IMPLANT LIABILITY AND COSTS

FROM CERTAIN CLAIMS-MADE INSURANCE CARRIERS. A HEARING WAS CONDUCTED IN

JANUARY 2003 AND THE ARBITRATION IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN THE SECOND

HALF OF 2003. IF THE PANEL DECIDES THE COVERAGE QUESTION IN THE COMPANY'S

FAVOR, IT WILL THEN DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF COVERAGE IN A SUBSEQUENT

PROCEEDING.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD RECEIVABLES FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES

RELATED TO THE BREAST IMPLANT MATTER OF $339 MILLION, REPRESENTING SETTLED BUT

YET TO BE RECEIVED AMOUNTS ($16 MILLION), AS WELL AS AMOUNTS CONTESTED BY THE

INSURANCE CARRIERS IN THE MINNESOTA LITIGATION AND THE LONDON ARBITRATION

($323 MILLION). VARIOUS FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF

INSURANCE PROCEEDS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS INSURANCE

POLICIES, INCLUDING (I) THE OUTCOME OF OCCURRENCE INSURANCE LITIGATION IN THE

COURTS OF MINNESOTA (AS DISCUSSED ABOVE); (II) THE OUTCOME OF THE ARBITRATION

WITH CLAIMS-MADE INSURERS IN LONDON; AND (III) THE EXTENT TO WHICH INSURERS

MAY BECOME INSOLVENT IN THE FUTURE. THERE CAN BE NO ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT

THE COMPANY WILL COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS RECORDED AS BEING PROBABLE OF RECOVERY

FROM ITS INSURERS.

11

RESPIRATOR/MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION

-----------------------------------

FOR MORE THAN 20 YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDED AND RESOLVED THE

CLAIMS OF OVER 200,000 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS ALLEGING INJURIES FROM

OCCUPATIONAL DUST EXPOSURES. THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS

RESOLVED BY THE COMPANY ALLEGED USE OF SOME OF THE COMPANY'S MASK AND

RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND SOUGHT DAMAGES FROM THE COMPANY AND OTHER DEFENDANTS

FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY FROM WORK PLACE EXPOSURES TO ASBESTOS OR, LESS

FREQUENTLY, SILICA AND OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUST, FOUND IN PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED

BY OTHER DEFENDANTS. THE REMAINING CLAIMANTS GENERALLY ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY

FROM OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS FROM UNSPECIFIED PRODUCTS CLAIMED TO

HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER DEFENDANTS AND/OR FROM

SPECIALTY PRODUCTS CONTAINING ASBESTOS MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY AND/OR

OTHER DEFENDANTS.

THE COMPANY'S VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF THIS LITIGATION HAS RESULTED IN: (I) JURY

VERDICTS FOR THE COMPANY IN TWO OF THREE CASES TRIED TO VERDICT; (II)

DISMISSALS OF LAWSUITS WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT BY THE COMPANY; AND (III) AN

AVERAGE SETTLEMENT VALUE OF LESS THAN $1,000 PER CLAIMANT FOR ALL OF THE

CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS THAT THE COMPANY HAS RESOLVED. IN MANY OF THESE LAWSUITS

AND CLAIMS, THE COMPANY IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT WITH MULTIPLE CO-DEFENDANTS

WHERE NO PRODUCT THE COMPANY MANUFACTURED IS INVOLVED OR WHERE THE COMPANY IS

ULTIMATELY DETERMINED NOT TO HAVE MANUFACTURED THE PRODUCTS IDENTIFIED BY THE

PLAINTIFFS.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN OCTOBER 2001, THE COMPANY DEFENDED AT TRIAL, IN THE

CIRCUIT COURT OF HOLMES COUNTY, MISSISSIPPI, PLAINTIFFS' CLAIMS THAT A 3M

RESPIRATOR AND MASK DID NOT PROTECT THEM AGAINST CONTRACTING CERTAIN ASBESTOS-

RELATED DISEASES ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCTS

MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS. THE CASE AGAINST THE COMPANY INITIALLY

INVOLVED SIX PLAINTIFFS WHOSE CLAIMS WERE CONSOLIDATED FOR TRIAL. THE COURT

DISMISSED ONE PLAINTIFF'S CASE JUST BEFORE TRIAL, AND A SECOND PLAINTIFF

ABANDONED HIS CASE BEFORE IT WAS SUBMITTED TO THE JURY. ON OCTOBER 26, 2001

THE JURY RETURNED VERDICTS AGAINST ALL DEFENDANTS IN FAVOR OF THE PLAINTIFFS,

FOUR OF WHOM HAD CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY. THE JURY AWARDED THE PLAINTIFFS

$25 MILLION EACH IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES. THE JURY DENIED PLAINTIFFS' REQUEST

FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. BASED ON THE JURY'S FINDINGS OF PERCENTAGE OF FAULT

ATTRIBUTABLE TO EACH DEFENDANT, THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF THE TOTAL OF THE FOUR

VERDICTS AGAINST IT IS $22.5 MILLION. THE COMPANY CAN PROVIDE NO ASSURANCE AT

THIS TIME ABOUT THE ABILITY OF THE OTHER TWO CO-DEFENDANTS TO PAY THEIR

RESPECTIVE SHARES OF ANY ULTIMATE JUDGMENT OR WHETHER A CO-DEFENDANT'S

INABILITY TO PAY WILL CAUSE A REALLOCATION OF THE LIABILITY FOR DAMAGES AMONG

THE REMAINING SOLVENT DEFENDANTS UNDER STATE LAW. ONE OF THE CO-DEFENDANTS,

ACANDS, HAS FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION. ANOTHER CO-DEFENDANT,

DRESSER INDUSTRIES, IS A SUBSIDIARY OF HALLIBURTON COMPANY, WHICH ANNOUNCED ON

DECEMBER 18, 2002 A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT OF ALL PERSONAL INJURY

ASBESTOS CLAIMS AGAINST HALLIBURTON COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT KNOW AT THIS TIME THE IMPACT OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT ON THE

JUDGMENT IN THE MISSISSIPPI CASE AGAINST DRESSER INDUSTRIES. JUDGMENT WAS

ENTERED ON JANUARY 30, 2002. THE TRIAL COURT DENIED THE COMPANY'S POST-TRIAL

MOTIONS IN A DECISION ON AUGUST 21, 2002, AND THE COMPANY FILED A NOTICE OF

APPEAL WITH THE MISSISSIPPI SUPREME COURT.  BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT

THE JUDGMENT ULTIMATELY WILL BE OVERTURNED, NO LIABILITY HAS BEEN RECORDED

RELATED TO THIS MATTER AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. IF ANY DAMAGES ARE ULTIMATELY

ASSESSED AGAINST THE COMPANY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF

SUCH DAMAGES TO BE COVERED BY THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY IS A NAMED DEFENDANT, WITH MULTIPLE

CO-DEFENDANTS, IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS IN VARIOUS COURTS THAT PURPORT TO

REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 45,000 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS. THE VAST MAJORITY

OF THESE CURRENT CLAIMANTS ALLEGE USE OF SOME OF THE COMPANY'S MASK AND

RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND SEEK DAMAGES FROM THE COMPANY AND OTHER DEFENDANTS

FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY FROM WORK PLACE EXPOSURES TO ASBESTOS OR,

LESS FREQUENTLY, SILICA AND OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUST, FOUND IN PRODUCTS

MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS. THE REMAINING CLAIMANTS GENERALLY ALLEGE

PERSONAL INJURY FROM OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS FROM UNSPECIFIED

PRODUCTS CLAIMED TO HAVE BEEN MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY OR OTHER DEFENDANTS

AND/OR FROM SPECIALTY PRODUCTS CONTAINING ASBESTOS MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY

AND/OR OTHER DEFENDANTS. THE COMPANY SETTLED AN UNUSUALLY LARGE NUMBER OF

PENDING CLAIMS DURING 2002 AND THUS HAD A SUBSTANTIAL REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF

12

OPEN CLAIMS - FROM APPROXIMATELY 80,000 CLAIMANTS AT THE END OF 2001 TO

APPROXIMATELY 45,000 AT THE END OF 2002.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY WAS SERVED WITH COMPLAINTS

IDENTIFYING APPROXIMATELY 6,000 CLAIMANTS IN MISSISSIPPI. WE BELIEVE THAT THIS

ACTIVITY IS RELATED TO TORT REFORM LEGISLATION ADOPTED IN MISSISSIPPI IN

NOVEMBER 2002 THAT WENT INTO EFFECT ON JANUARY 1, 2003, AND THAT THE NEW CASES

WERE FILED IN ANTICIPATION OF THE NEW LAW.  WE EXPECT TO SEE AN ADDITIONAL

INCREASE IN MISSISSIPPI CLAIMS IN THE FIRST QUARTER AS THERE IS OFTEN A DELAY

BETWEEN THE FILING OF COMPLAINTS AND SERVICE OF THE COMPLAINTS ON THE COMPANY.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE ASSERTED SPECIFIC DOLLAR CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES IN ONLY ABOUT ONE-

SIXTH OF THE 7,404 LAWSUITS THAT WERE PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY AT THE END

OF 2002 IN ALL JURISDICTIONS. A MAJORITY OF STATES RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT

SPECIFYING DAMAGES IN TORT CASES SUCH AS THESE, AND MOST OF THE REMAINING

JURISDICTIONS DO NOT REQUIRE SUCH SPECIFICATION.  IN THOSE CASES IN WHICH

PLAINTIFFS CHOOSE TO ASSERT SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THEIR COMPLAINTS,

BROUGHT IN STATES THAT PERMIT SUCH PLEADING, THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED ARE TYPICALLY

NOT MEANINGFUL AS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY.  THIS IS

BECAUSE (A) THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED TYPICALLY BEAR NO RELATION TO THE LEVEL OF

PLAINTIFF'S INJURY, IF ANY; (B) THE COMPLAINTS NEARLY ALWAYS ASSERT CLAIMS

AGAINST MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS WITH THE TYPICAL COMPLAINT ASSERTING CLAIMS

AGAINST AN AVERAGE OF 88 DIFFERENT DEFENDANTS, THE DAMAGES ALLEGED ARE NOT

ATTRIBUTED TO INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS, AND A DEFENDANT'S SHARE OF LIABILITY MAY

TURN ON THE LAW OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY, WHICH CAN VARY BY STATE, AND

BY THE AMOUNT OF FAULT A JURY ALLOCATES TO EACH DEFENDANT IF A CASE IS

ULTIMATELY TRIED BEFORE A JURY; (C) MANY CASES ARE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY

EVEN THOUGH THE PLAINTIFFS DID NOT USE ANY OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS AND,

ULTIMATELY, ARE WITHDRAWN OR DISMISSED WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT; AND (D) MANY CASES

ARE BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFFS WHO HAVE NOT SUFFERED ANY MEDICAL INJURY,

AND, ULTIMATELY, ARE RESOLVED WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT OR A PAYMENT THAT IS A SMALL

FRACTION OF THE DAMAGES INITIALLY CLAIMED. OF THE 1,274 PENDING CASES IN WHICH

PURPORTED DAMAGE AMOUNTS ARE SPECIFIED IN THE COMPLAINTS, 579 CASES INVOLVE

CLAIMS OF $100,000 OR LESS, 177 CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS BETWEEN $100,000 AND $3

MILLION (37 OF THESE CASES ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $250,000 AND 42 OF

THESE CASES ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $2.5 MILLION), 117 CASES INVOLVE

CLAIMS OF $7.5 MILLION (WITH AN EQUAL AMOUNT OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES), 365 CASES

INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $10 MILLION (316 OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE AN EQUAL AMOUNT IN

PUNITIVE DAMAGES), 3 CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $15 MILLION, 2 CASES INVOLVE

CLAIMS OF $20 MILLION, AND 31 CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $50 MILLION (5 OF WHICH

ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $5 MILLION). SOME COMPLAINTS ALLEGE THAT THE

COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE AT LEAST THE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED. AS NOTED

ABOVE, THE COMPANY HAS MORE THAN 20 YEARS OF EXPERIENCE IN DEFENDING

LITIGATIONS OF THIS TYPE, AND HAS TO DATE RESOLVED THE CLAIMS OF OVER 200,000

PLAINTIFFS.  THE CUMULATIVE AVERAGE SETTLEMENT AMOUNT IS LESS THAN $1,000 PER

CLAIMANT. BASED ON THIS EXPERIENCE AND FOR THE OTHER REASONS NOTED ABOVE THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE DAMAGE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED IN COMPLAINTS ARE NOT A

MEANINGFUL FACTOR IN ANY ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANY'S POTENTIAL LIABILITY.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD ESTIMATED ACCRUED LIABILITIES OF

APPROXIMATELY $161 MILLION FOR RESPIRATOR/MASK ASBESTOS RELATED CLAIMS, A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF WHICH THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO BE COVERED BY ITS PRODUCT

LIABILITY INSURANCE.  THIS AMOUNT REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S BEST ESTIMATE OF

THE AMOUNT TO COVER THE COST AND EXPENSE OF RESOLVING RECENTLY SETTLED,

CURRENT AND PROBABLE FUTURE RESPIRATOR/MASK ASBESTOS RELATED CLAIMS. THE

COMPANY ALSO HAD RECEIVABLES FOR EXPECTED INSURANCE RECOVERIES OF

APPROXIMATELY $264 MILLION. VARIOUS FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT

OF PROCEEDS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS INSURANCE POLICIES,

INCLUDING (I) THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS MADE IN SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS; (II) DELAYS

IN OR AVOIDANCE OF PAYMENT BY INSURERS; AND (III) THE EXTENT TO WHICH INSURERS

MAY BECOME INSOLVENT IN THE FUTURE. THERE CAN BE NO ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT

THE COMPANY WILL COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS RECORDED AS BEING PROBABLE OF RECOVERY

FROM ITS INSURERS.

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ACCRUED LIABILITY AND INSURANCE

RECEIVABLE REPRESENTS THE TIME DELAY BETWEEN PAYMENT OF CLAIMS AND

RECEIPT OF INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENTS. BECAUSE OF THE LAG TIME BETWEEN

SETTLEMENT AND PAYMENT OF A CLAIM, NO MEANINGFUL CONCLUSIONS MAY BE

DRAWN FROM QUARTERLY CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES FOR

13

EXPECTED INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND THE QUARTERLY CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF

CLAIMANTS AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER.

THE COMPANY'S CURRENT ESTIMATE OF ITS PROBABLE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED

EXPENSES FOR RESPIRATOR/MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION IS BASED ON FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES EXISTING AT THIS TIME.  RECENT DEVELOPMENTS IN THE MIX OF NEWLY

FILED RESPIRATOR/MASK LAWSUITS (SOME INCREASE IN THE PROPORTION OF SILICA-

RELATED CLAIMS) AND THE DEFENSE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S CONTINUED

AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE STRATEGY WILL BE CLOSELY MONITORED BY THE COMPANY IN THE

NEAR TERM.  ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENTS MAY OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S

ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED EXPENSES. THESE DEVELOPMENTS

INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, (I) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF

FUTURE CLAIMS, (II) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING

CLAIMS, (III) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL COSTS OF DEFENDING THESE

CLAIMS AND IN MAINTAINING TRIAL READINESS, (IV) CHANGES IN THE NATURE OF

CLAIMS RECEIVED, (V) CHANGES IN THE LAW AND PROCEDURE APPLICABLE TO THESE

CLAIMS, (VI) FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER CO-DEFENDANTS AND INSURERS, AND

(VII) OTHER UNKNOWN VARIABLES. THE COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF

THESE POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS ON THE CURRENT ESTIMATE OF ITS PROBABLE

LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED EXPENSES.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

---------------------

THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

ENFORCEABLE BY FOREIGN, FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES, AND PRIVATE

PARTIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD, INCLUDING THOSE PERTAINING TO AIR

EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER DISCHARGES, TOXIC SUBSTANCES, AND THE HANDLING AND

DISPOSAL OF SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTES. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS PROVIDE,

UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A BASIS FOR THE REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATION, AS

WELL AS PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS. THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED,

AND WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR, COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN COMPLYING WITH

THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, DEFENDING POTENTIAL PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY

DAMAGE CLAIMS, AND MODIFYING ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN LIGHT OF ITS

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES. IN ITS EFFORT TO SATISFY ITS ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE

COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED, AND PERIODICALLY UPDATES, POLICIES RELATING TO

ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR ITS OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE.

UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES COMPREHENSIVE

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980 AND SIMILAR

STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY MAY BE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR THE COSTS OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AT CURRENT OR FORMER FACILITIES AND AT OFF-SITE

LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS LOCATIONS, MOST OF WHICH ARE IN

THE UNITED STATES, AT WHICH IT MAY HAVE SOME LIABILITY. AMOUNTS EXPENSED FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES WERE NOT MATERIAL AT THESE LOCATIONS, NOR

HAVE THERE BEEN MATERIAL CHANGES IN THE RECORDED LIABILITIES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS.

LIABILITIES FOR ESTIMATED COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ARE, DEPENDING ON

THE SITE, BASED PRIMARILY UPON INTERNAL OR THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES,

AND ESTIMATES AS TO THE NUMBER, PARTICIPATION LEVEL AND FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF

ANY OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, THE EXTENT OF THE CONTAMINATION AND

THE NATURE OF REQUIRED REMEDIAL ACTIONS. RECORDED LIABILITIES ARE ADJUSTED AS

FURTHER INFORMATION DEVELOPS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT

THE AMOUNTS RECORDED WILL BE PAID OUT OVER THE PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE

APPLICABLE SITES, CURRENTLY RANGING UP TO 30 YEARS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

THE COMPANY HAD RECORDED LIABILITIES OF $37 MILLION FOR ESTIMATED

ENVIRONMENTAL INVESTIGATORY AND REMEDIATION COSTS BASED UPON AN EVALUATION OF

CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FACTS WITH RESPECT TO EACH INDIVIDUAL SITE.

IT IS OFTEN DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE

AND REMEDIATION AND POTENTIAL CLAIMS GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING

THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

AND REGULATIONS, THE EXTENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND THE

EXISTENCE OF ALTERNATE CLEANUP METHODS. THE COMPANY'S CURRENT ASSESSMENT

OF THE PROBABLE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED EXPENSES RELATED TO SUCH

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS IS BASED ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES KNOWN AT

THIS TIME. NEW DEVELOPMENTS MAY OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANY'S

ASSESSMENT. THESE DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, (I)

14

CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

OF THE COMPANY'S OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS; (II) CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL

REGULATIONS OR ENFORCEMENT POLICIES, INCLUDING EFFORTS TO RECOVER

NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES; (III) NEW AND EVOLVING ANALYTICAL AND

REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES; (IV) SUCCESS IN ALLOCATING LIABILITY TO OTHER

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES; AND (V) FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER

POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND THIRD-PARTY INDEMNITORS. THE COMPANY

CANNOT DETERMINE THE IMPACT OF THESE POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS ON THE CURRENT

ESTIMATE OF ITS PROBABLE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED EXPENSES.

THE COMPANY HAS BEEN VOLUNTARILY COOPERATING WITH ONGOING REVIEWS BY THE

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA) AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES OF THE

POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH EFFECTS OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY. AS

PREVIOUSLY ANNOUNCED, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN PHASING OUT ITS PRODUCTION OF SUCH

COMPOUNDS.  WITH RESPECT TO ONE SUCH COMPOUND THE EPA IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING

POSSIBLE REGULATORY ACTION UNDER ITS STATUTORY AUTHORITY RELATING TO COMPOUNDS

THAT MAY POSE POSSIBLE HUMAN HEALTH EFFECTS.  THE COMPANY RECENTLY CONFIRMED

TO THE EPA ITS INTENT TO CONTINUE ITS ONGOING HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL

INVESTIGATION AND ASSESSMENT OF THIS COMPOUND. AS A RESULT OF ITS PHASE-OUT

DECISION, THE COMPANY NO LONGER MANUFACTURES THAT COMPOUND EXCEPT THAT A

SUBSIDIARY PRODUCES LIMITED QUANTITIES FOR ITS OWN INDUSTRIAL USE.  THE

COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHAT REGULATORY ACTION, IF ANY, MAY BE TAKEN REGARDING

SOME OR ALL OF SUCH COMPOUNDS OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH ACTION.

ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, A FORMER EMPLOYEE FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT AGAINST

THE COMPANY IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA SEEKING UNSTATED

COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND ALLEGING THAT THE PLAINTIFFS SUFFERED

FEAR, INCREASED RISK AND SUB CLINICAL INJURIES FROM EXPOSURE TO

PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY AT OR NEAR THE COMPANY'S DECATUR, ALABAMA

MANUFACTURING FACILITY.  THE COMPLAINT ALSO ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY ACTED

IMPROPERLY WITH RESPECT TO DISCLOSURES TO WORKERS CONCERNING SUCH CHEMISTRY.

RECENTLY, THE PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT TO ADD AS PLAINTIFFS ANOTHER FORMER EMPLOYEE,

A CURRENT EMPLOYEE AND THEIR MINOR CHILDREN. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE

ALLEGATIONS HAVE NO MERIT AND IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THESE CLAIMS.

THE COMPANY HAS AGREED TO ENTER INTO A CONSENT AGREEMENT WITH THE STATE OF NEW

YORK DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONSERVATION FOR ALLEGED VIOLATIONS OF THE

NEW YORK AIR EMISSIONS REGULATIONS. THE PROPOSED AGREEMENT CALLS FOR A PENALTY

OF $212,000, A PORTION OF WHICH WILL BE USED TO IMPROVE PROCESSES AT THE

COMPANY'S TONAWANDA, NEW YORK MANUFACTURING FACILITY.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT WITH

THE EPA UNDER BOTH AN "AGREEMENT FOR TSCA COMPLIANCE" AND THE EPA'S INCENTIVES

FOR SELF POLICING POLICY.  THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY CONDUCTED AN AUDIT UNDER

THE TOXIC SUBSTANCES CONTROL ACT (TSCA) OF ITS FACILITIES AND BUSINESS UNITS

AND TO IDENTIFY STUDIES THAT UNDER CURRENT EPA GUIDELINES COULD BE POTENTIALLY

SUBJECT TO NOTIFICATION UNDER TSCA SECTION 8(E). THE COMPANY HAS REACHED AN

AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH THE EPA UNDER WHICH IT WOULD PAY $222,000 IN

PENALTIES IN CONNECTION WITH THE FIRST TWO PHASES OF THIS AUDIT RELATING TO

PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY STUDIES.  THE THIRD PHASE, RELATING TO THIS AND

OTHER CHEMISTRIES, IS EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETED IN EARLY 2003.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE

MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995.  THESE

STATEMENTS MAY BE IDENTIFIED BY THE USE OF WORDS LIKE "PLAN," "EXPECT," "AIM,"

"BELIEVE," "PROJECT," "ANTICIPATE," "INTEND," "ESTIMATE," "WILL," "SHOULD,"

"COULD" AND OTHER EXPRESSIONS THAT INDICATE FUTURE EVENTS AND TRENDS. ALL

STATEMENTS THAT ADDRESS EXPECTATIONS OR PROJECTIONS ABOUT THE FUTURE,

INCLUDING STATEMENTS ABOUT THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY FOR GROWTH, PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT, MARKET POSITION, EXPENDITURES AND FINANCIAL RESULTS, ARE FORWARD-

LOOKING STATEMENTS.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON CERTAIN ASSUMPTIONS AND EXPECTATIONS

OF FUTURE EVENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES. ACTUAL FUTURE

RESULTS AND TRENDS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM HISTORICAL RESULTS OR THOSE

PROJECTED IN ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS DEPENDING ON A VARIETY OF

FACTORS, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE FOLLOWING.

* THE EFFECTS OF, AND CHANGES IN, WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. THE COMPANY

OPERATES IN MORE THAN 60 COUNTRIES AND DERIVES MORE THAN HALF OF ITS REVENUES

FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.  THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY

FACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES THAT ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL,

SUCH AS DOWNTURNS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION;

SOCIAL, POLITICAL OR LABOR CONDITIONS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION; OR

POTENTIAL ADVERSE FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES.

* FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THOSE RATES MAY AFFECT

THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO REALIZE PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN ITS SALES AND NET

EARNINGS AND ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. BECAUSE THE COMPANY DERIVES MORE THAN

HALF ITS REVENUES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, ITS ABILITY TO REALIZE

PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN SALES AND NET EARNINGS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE UNITED STATES DOLLAR STRENGTHENS

SIGNIFICANTLY AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES.

* THE COMPANY'S GROWTH OBJECTIVES ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TIMING AND

MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF ITS NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING ITS ABILITY TO RENEW

ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS TO MARKET.  THIS

ABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT, SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO: IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW PRODUCTS; OBTAIN

ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION; GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW

PRODUCTS, OR SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE CLINICAL TRIALS AND OBTAIN REGULATORY

APPROVALS. AS WITH ANY PHARMACEUTICAL UNDER DEVELOPMENT, THERE ARE SUBSTANTIAL

RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES IN THE PROCESS OF DEVELOPMENT AND REGULATORY REVIEW.

THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT PRODUCTS WILL RECEIVE REGULATORY APPROVALS OR

PROVE TO BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL.

* THE COMPANY'S FUTURE RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COSTS OF

PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS DUE TO MARKET DEMAND, CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RISKS, SHORTAGES AND OTHER FACTORS. THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON VARIOUS COMPONENTS

AND MATERIALS FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF ITS PRODUCTS.  ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY HAS

NOT EXPERIENCED ANY DIFFICULTY IN OBTAINING COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT ANY OF ITS SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS COULD BE TERMINATED IN THE

FUTURE. ANY SUSTAINED INTERRUPTION IN THE COMPANY'S RECEIPT OF ADEQUATE

SUPPLIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.  IN ADDITION,

WHILE THE COMPANY HAS A PROCESS TO MINIMIZE VOLATILITY IN COMPONENT AND

MATERIAL PRICING, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO

SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS DUE TO MARKET DEMAND, CURRENCY RISKS,

OR SHORTAGES, OR THAT FUTURE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

* THE POSSIBILITY THAT ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES MAY

NOT MEET SALES AND/OR PROFIT EXPECTATIONS. AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S STRATEGY

FOR GROWTH, THE COMPANY HAS MADE AND MAY CONTINUE TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS,

DIVESTITURES AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ABSOLUTE

ASSURANCE THAT THESE WILL BE COMPLETED OR BENEFICIAL TO THE COMPANY.

17

* THE COMPANY IS THE SUBJECT OF VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. THE CURRENT

ESTIMATES OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR ITS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND

CLAIMS ARE PREDICTIONS MADE BY THE COMPANY ABOUT THE FUTURE AND SHOULD BE

CONSIDERED FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. THESE ESTIMATES COULD CHANGE IN THE

FUTURE. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING THE

COMPANY, SEE THE DISCUSSION OF "LEGAL PROCEEDINGS" IN PART I, ITEM 3 OF THIS

ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

AS STATED IN OUR SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS MOST

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES RELATE TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, POTENTIAL ASSET

IMPAIRMENT ISSUES, AND THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY'S CORE ACTIVITIES RELATE TO THE DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE AND SALE

OF THOUSANDS OF PRODUCTS TO NUMEROUS MARKETS. WHILE THIS RISK DISPERSION

PROVIDES A MEASURE OF OVERALL STABILITY, IT ALSO RESULTS IN LEGAL RISKS IN

SOME AREAS.  THE COMPANY RECORDS LIABILITIES IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE IT CAN

REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS AND WHERE LIABILITY PROBABLY WILL

ARISE. THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS RECEIVABLES FOR THE PROBABLE AMOUNT OF

INSURANCE THAT IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER UNDER THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE PROGRAM IN

THOSE INSTANCES. THE COMPANY CANNOT ALWAYS DEFINITIVELY DETERMINE POSSIBLE

LIABILITIES THAT EXCEED RECORDED AMOUNTS RELATED TO THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS TO

WHICH IT IS A PARTY. THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT THE COMPANY MAY NOT

ULTIMATELY INCUR CHARGES, WHETHER RELATED TO PRODUCTS LIABILITY, ANTITRUST, OR

OTHER LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS, OR OTHER ACTIONS, IN EXCESS OF

PRESENTLY RECORDED LIABILITIES. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT UNLIKELY,

BASED UPON THE NATURE OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND ITS CURRENT KNOWLEDGE OF

RELEVANT FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THAT THE POSSIBLE LIABILITIES EXCEEDING

RECORDED AMOUNTS WOULD BE MATERIAL INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE TO ITS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS.

KNOWN LEGAL RISKS INCLUDE THE ULTIMATE COLLECTION OF BREAST IMPLANT INSURANCE

RECEIVABLES (A MATTER CURRENTLY IN DISPUTE WITH THE COMPANY'S INSURANCE

CARRIERS), RESPIRATOR/MASK/ASBESTOS INSURANCE RECEIVABLES COLLECTION AND

PROBABLE LIABILITIES, AND AN OUTSTANDING LAWSUIT FILED BY LEPAGE'S

INCORPORATED THAT EXTENDS BACK TO 1997.

SUMMARY AMOUNTS CONCERNING THE BREAST IMPLANT AND RESPIRATOR/MASK/ASBESTOS

LITIGATION FOLLOW.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

AT DECEMBER 31                            2002        2001        2000

(MILLIONS)

----------------------------------------------------------------------

BREAST IMPLANT RECEIVABLES                $339        $406        $519

BREAST IMPLANT LIABILITIES                $  5        $ 20        $ 32

RESPIRATOR/MASK/ASBESTOS RECEIVABLES      $264        $223        $155

RESPIRATOR/MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES      $161        $156        $108

----------------------------------------------------------------------

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAS ACCRUED RECEIVABLES OF $339 MILLION

RELATING TO BREAST IMPLANTS.  OF THIS $339 MILLION, $16 MILLION REPRESENTS

SETTLED BUT YET TO BE RECEIVED AMOUNTS, WHILE $323 MILLION HAS BEEN CONTESTED

BY INSURANCE CARRIERS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS LIKELY TO OBTAIN

RELIEF IN THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT. IF THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT DOES

NOT GRANT RELIEF AS ANTICIPATED, THE COMPANY COULD BE EFFECTIVELY DEPRIVED OF

SIGNIFICANT AND POTENTIALLY MATERIAL INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR BREAST IMPLANT

CLAIMS. AS PART OF THE COMPANY'S EFFORTS TO RECOVER THE AMOUNTS CONTESTED BY

THE INSURANCE CARRIERS, THE COMPANY ALSO INITIATED AN ARBITRATION PROCEEDING

IN LONDON, ENGLAND, TO RECOVER INSURANCE COVERAGE FOR BREAST IMPLANT

LIABILITY AND COSTS FROM CLAIMS-MADE INSURANCE CARRIERS. THE ARBITRATION

HEARING WILL FIRST CONSIDER WHETHER THE POLICY PROVIDES INSURANCE COVERAGE

FOR THE COMPANY'S BREAST IMPLANT LIABILITY AND COSTS. IF THE PANEL FAVORABLY

DECIDES THE COVERAGE QUESTION FOR THE COMPANY, IT WILL THEN DETERMINE THE

AMOUNT OF COVERAGE IN A SUBSEQUENT HEARING LATER IN 2003.

18

THE COMPANY'S REMAINING RESPIRATOR/MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITY IS $161 MILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002.  THIS ESTIMATE REPRESENTS THE COMPANY'S BEST ESTIMATE OF

ITS LIABILITY. IF AMOUNTS ARE PAID IN SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS OR IF ANY DAMAGES

ARE ULTIMATELY ASSESSED AGAINST THE COMPANY IN CURRENT OR FUTURE LITIGATION, A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF SUCH AMOUNTS IS EXPECTED TO BE COVERED BY THE COMPANY'S

PRODUCT LIABILITY INSURANCE.  VARIOUS FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE TIMING AND

AMOUNT OF PROCEEDS TO BE RECEIVED UNDER THE COMPANY'S VARIOUS INSURANCE

POLICIES, INCLUDING (I) THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS MADE IN SETTLEMENT OF CLAIMS;

(II) DELAYS IN OR AVOIDANCE OF PAYMENT BY INSURERS; AND (III) THE EXTENT TO

WHICH INSURERS MAY BECOME INSOLVENT IN THE FUTURE. THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY

THAT THE COMPANY WILL COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS RECORDED AS BEING PROBABLE OF

RECOVERY FROM ITS INSURERS.

3M HAS NOT RECORDED ANY LIABILITY FOR THE LEPAGE'S INCORPORATED LITIGATION AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2002.  3M EXPECTS TO PREVAIL IN THIS LITIGATION, BUT IF 3M

DOES NOT PREVAIL, 3M WOULD INCUR A PRE-TAX CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $85

MILLION.  3M WOULD ALSO BE POTENTIALLY LIABLE FOR LEPAGE'S ATTORNEYS' FEES AND

COSTS.

POTENTIAL ASSET IMPAIRMENT ISSUES.

THERE ARE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS MADE BY MANAGEMENT IN PREPARING THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR WHICH ACTUAL RESULTS WILL EMERGE OVER

LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THIS INCLUDES THE RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

EMPLOYED IN THE BUSINESS, INCLUDING ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES.  THESE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE CLOSELY MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND PERIODICALLY

ADJUSTED AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT. FOR INSTANCE, EXPECTED ASSET LIVES MAY BE

SHORTENED OR AN IMPAIRMENT RECORDED BASED ON A CHANGE IN THE EXPECTED USE OF

THE ASSET OR PERFORMANCE OF THE RELATED BUSINESS REPORTING UNIT.  ALTHOUGH

THERE IS GREATER RISK WITH RESPECT TO THE ACCURACY OF THESE LONG-TERM

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS BECAUSE OF THE LONG PERIOD OVER WHICH ACTUAL RESULTS

WILL EMERGE, SUCH RISK IS MITIGATED BY MANAGEMENT'S ABILITY TO MAKE CHANGES IN

THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS OVER THE SAME LONG PERIOD. 3M HAS

APPROXIMATELY $1.9 BILLION OF GOODWILL THAT, BASED ON IMPAIRMENT TESTING, IS

NOT IMPAIRED. A PORTION OF THIS GOODWILL (APPROXIMATELY $220 MILLION) IS IN

3M'S TELECOMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS, WHICH THE COMPANY BELIEVES WILL MAINTAIN ITS

VALUE.  HOWEVER, IF UNANTICIPATED EVENTS IMPACT THIS SECTOR FOR AN EXTENDED

PERIOD OF TIME, IT COULD CREATE FUTURE IMPAIRMENT LOSSES.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

PENSION EXPENSE IMPACTED 2002 EARNINGS BY 16 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE COMPARED

WITH PENSION EXPENSE OF 8 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE IN 2001. THE COMPANY EXPECTS

PENSION EXPENSE TO INCREASE APPROXIMATELY ANOTHER 10 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE

IN 2003, LARGELY ATTRIBUTED TO UNRECOGNIZED LOSSES ON PENSION ASSETS RELATED

TO EQUITY MARKET WEAKNESS THE LAST FEW YEARS. IN ACCOUNTING FOR PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS, COSTS AND RELATED LIABILITIES ARE DEVELOPED USING

ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS.  THESE VALUATIONS INCLUDE KEY ASSUMPTIONS DETERMINED BY

MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE DISCOUNT RATE AND EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN

ON PLAN ASSETS.  FOR THE UNITED STATES PENSION PLAN EXPENSE CALCULATION FOR

2003, THE COMPANY'S LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON ASSET ASSUMPTION REMAINS AT 9

PERCENT AND ITS YEAR-END 2002 DISCOUNT RATE ASSUMPTION IS 6.75 PERCENT (WHICH

IS USED FOR 2003 EXPENSE CALCULATIONS), WHICH REPRESENTS A HALF PERCENTAGE

POINT REDUCTION FROM THE YEAR-END 2001 DISCOUNT RATE. THE DISCOUNT RATE

DECREASE IS CONSISTENT WITH CHANGES IN HIGH-QUALITY LONG-TERM CORPORATE BOND

INDICES.  THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ASSUMPTION CONSIDERS THE ASSET

MIX OF THE PLANS (APPROXIMATELY 70 PERCENT EQUITY SECURITIES AND 30 PERCENT

FIXED INCOME), PAST PERFORMANCE, AND OTHER FACTORS.  ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

CONCERNING THE COMPANY'S PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND RELATED

PERIODIC COST CAN BE FOUND IN NOTE 14 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. MATERIAL CHANGES IN PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT COSTS MAY

OCCUR IN THE FUTURE DUE TO CHANGES IN THESE ASSUMPTIONS.  FUTURE ANNUAL

AMOUNTS COULD BE IMPACTED BY CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF PLAN PARTICIPANTS,

CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF BENEFITS PROVIDED, CHANGES IN THE DISCOUNT RATES,

CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN, CHANGES IN THE LEVEL OF

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PLANS AND OTHER FACTORS. A QUARTER PERCENTAGE POINT

CHANGE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD IMPACT 3M'S PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY

$32 MILLION ON A PRE-TAX BASIS.  A QUARTER PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN WOULD IMPACT 3M'S PENSION EXPENSE BY

APPROXIMATELY $23 MILLION ON A PRE-TAX BASIS.

19

BASED ON A CRITICAL ASSESSMENT OF ITS ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND THE UNDERLYING

JUDGMENTS AND UNCERTAINTIES AFFECTING THE APPLICATION OF THOSE POLICIES,

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

PROVIDE A MEANINGFUL AND FAIR PERSPECTIVE OF THE COMPANY. THIS IS NOT TO

SUGGEST THAT OTHER GENERAL RISK FACTORS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC

CONDITIONS, FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, ACHIEVEMENT OF

CORPORATE GROWTH OBJECTIVES, CHANGES IN MATERIAL COSTS, PERFORMANCE OF

ACQUIRED BUSINESSES AND OTHERS, COULD NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT THE COMPANY'S

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS IN

FUTURE PERIODS.

OPERATING RESULTS

OVERVIEW.

NET INCOME TOTALED $1.974 BILLION, OR $4.99 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED WITH

$1.430 BILLION, OR $3.58 PER DILUTED SHARE, IN 2001, AND $1.782 BILLION, OR

$4.45 PER DILUTED SHARE, IN 2000.  IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2002, NET INCOME WAS

IMPACTED BY NON-RECURRING CHARGES OF $108 MILLION, OR 27 CENTS PER DILUTED

SHARE, RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM THAT WAS APPROVED IN JUNE

2001.  IN 2002, CURRENCY EFFECTS REDUCED EARNINGS BY 8 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE,

WHILE THE ADOPTION OF A NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD RESULTING IN THE CESSATION OF

GOODWILL AMORTIZATION AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET AMORTIZATION

INCREASED EARNINGS BY 12 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. IN 2001, NET INCOME WAS

IMPACTED BY NON-RECURRING CHARGES OF $312 MILLION, OR 78 CENTS PER DILUTED

SHARE, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM APPROVED IN JUNE 2001.

IN 2000, NET INCOME WAS IMPACTED BY NON-RECURRING CHARGES OF $90 MILLION, OR 23

CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE. ADDITIONAL DETAILS CONCERNING NON-RECURRING ITEMS

FOLLOW.

NON-RECURRING ITEMS.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION ISSUED REGULATION G,

"CONDITIONS FOR USE OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES" A RULE DIRECTED BY THE

SARBANES-OXLEY ACT OF 2002.  THIS RULE REQUIRES PUBLIC COMPANIES THAT DISCLOSE

OR RELEASE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES TO INCLUDE THE MOST DIRECTLY COMPARABLE

GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURE, TO PROVIDE A RECONCILIATION OF THE DISCLOSED NON-GAAP

MEASURE TO THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP MEASURE, AND REQUIRES COMPANIES TO FURNISH

EARNINGS RELEASES OR SIMILAR ANNOUNCEMENTS TO THE COMMISSION ON FORM 8-K.

THIS RULE WILL APPLY TO ALL SUBJECT DISCLOSURES AS OF MARCH 28, 2003.  THE

RULE ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON WHAT CONSTITUTES "NON-RECURRING, INFREQUENT, OR

UNUSUAL" AS APPLIED TO SPECIFIC FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS OR EVENTS.  THE COMPANY

CURRENTLY PROVIDES RECONCILIATIONS OF ITS DISCLOSED NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

REPORTING TO THE MOST COMPARABLE GAAP FINANCIAL REPORTING.

IN ADDITION TO REGULATION G, THE SEC AMENDED ITEM 10 OF REGULATION S-K TO

PROVIDE ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE TO REGISTRANTS THAT INCLUDE NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

MEASURES IN SEC FILINGS.  THIS GUIDANCE WOULD PROHIBIT THE PRESENTATION OF

CERTAIN NON-GAAP FINANCIAL MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE FROM REPORTED RESULTS NON-

RECURRING, INFREQUENT OR UNUSUAL ITEMS WHEN THE NATURE OF THE CHARGE OR GAIN

IS SUCH THAT IS IT REASONABLY LIKELY TO RECUR WITHIN TWO YEARS OR THERE WAS A

SIMILAR CHARGE OR GAIN WITHIN THE PRIOR TWO YEARS.  THIS GUIDANCE COULD RESULT

IN CHANGES IN THE COMPANY'S FUTURE PRESENTATION OF NON-GAAP FINANCIAL

MEASURES.

IN 2002, NON-RECURRING CHARGES REDUCED OPERATING INCOME BY $202 MILLION AND NET

INCOME BY $108 MILLION.  THESE CHARGES PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO EMPLOYEE

SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT COSTS, ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION CHARGES, AND OTHER

ASSOCIATED EXIT COSTS UNDER THE COMPANY'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN ANNOUNCED IN JUNE

2001.  THESE CHARGES ARE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES ($121 MILLION); SELLING,

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ($77 MILLION); AND RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT

AND RELATED EXPENSES ($4 MILLION). OF THE TOTAL 2002 CHARGES, $111 MILLION

RELATED TO EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFIT COSTS, $47 MILLION RELATED TO

ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (INCREMENTAL CHARGES

RESULTING FROM SHORTENED DEPRECIABLE LIVES OF AFFECTED ASSETS, PRIMARILY

RELATED TO DOWNSIZING OR CONSOLIDATING MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS), AND $44

MILLION RELATED TO OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES. OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES INCLUDED

INCREMENTAL COSTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR ITEMS SUCH AS LEASE

TERMINATION PAYMENTS AND OTHER FACILITY EXIT COSTS (SUCH AS DEMOLITION OF

BUILDINGS, INVENTORY DISPOSALS, OTHER) INCURRED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THE PLAN.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING NON-RECURRING ITEMS IS PROVIDED IN THE

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ELSEWHERE HEREIN.

20

IN 2001, NON-RECURRING ITEMS REDUCED OPERATING INCOME BY $504 MILLION AND NET

INCOME BY $312 MILLION, OR 78 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE.   NON-RECURRING ITEMS OF

$569 MILLION, PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S RESTRUCTURING PLAN APPROVED

IN JUNE 2001, WERE INCLUDED IN COST OF SALES ($249 MILLION); SELLING, GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ($300 MILLION); AND RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND

RELATED EXPENSES ($20 MILLION). OF THIS $569 MILLION, $472 MILLION RELATED TO

EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFITS, $80 MILLION RELATED TO ACCELERATED

DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND $17 MILLION RELATED TO OTHER

EXIT ACTIVITIES.  IN ADDITION, COST OF SALES INCLUDED OTHER NON-RECURRING COSTS

OF $23 MILLION RELATED TO ACQUISITIONS.  NON-RECURRING ITEMS INCLUDED IN THE

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME) LINE WITHIN OPERATING INCOME INCLUDED $73 MILLION OF

INCOME DUE TO THE REVERSAL OF A 1999 LITIGATION ACCRUAL RELATED TO 3M'S

SUCCESSFUL APPEAL IN JANUARY 2002 IN AN ANTITRUST CASE BROUGHT BY LEPAGE'S INC.

ON FEBRUARY 25, 2002, THE THIRD CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS VACATED ITS PRIOR

RULING AND ORDERED A RE-HEARING IN MAY 2002 BY THE FULL COURT.  ORAL ARGUMENTS

ON THE APPEAL WERE HEARD ON OCTOBER 30, 2002, AND THE COMPANY EXPECTS A

DECISION IN 2003.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO BELIEVE THAT IT WILL

ULTIMATELY PREVAIL IN THE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER.  ALSO INCLUDED WITHIN THE

OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME) LINE WITHIN OPERATING INCOME IS A NET GAIN OF $15

MILLION RELATED TO THE SALE OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE EQUITY SECURITIES, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE WRITE-DOWN OF PERMANENTLY IMPAIRED AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE EQUITY

SECURITIES.

IN 2000, NON-RECURRING ITEMS REDUCED NET INCOME BY $90 MILLION, OR 23 CENTS PER

DILUTED SHARE.  OPERATING INCOME WAS REDUCED BY $23 MILLION, INCLUDING COSTS OF

$208 MILLION (REPORTED IN COST OF SALES) AND GAINS OF $185 MILLION, AND

REPORTED IN THE OTHER EXPENSE (INCOME) LINE WITHIN OPERATING INCOME.  NON-

RECURRING COSTS IN 2000 INCLUDED $168 MILLION OF COSTS IN THE SPECIALTY

MATERIAL SEGMENT RELATED TO THE COMPANY'S PHASE-OUT OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL-BASED

CHEMISTRY PRODUCTS, A $20 MILLION WRITE-DOWN OF CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED

ASSETS, AND $20 MILLION OF OTHER NON-RECURRING EXPENSES ($13 MILLION RELATED TO

ACQUISITIONS IN THE ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT).  MAJOR NON-CASH COSTS

INCLUDED IN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ITEMS WERE $73 MILLION OF ACCELERATED

DEPRECIATION AND $48 MILLION OF IMPAIRMENT LOSSES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO

PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT USED TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS PHASED OUT IN THE SPECIALTY

MATERIAL SEGMENT. NON-RECURRING GAINS IN 2000 WERE LARGELY RELATED TO ASSET

DISPOSITIONS, PRINCIPALLY THE SALE OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE EQUITY SECURITIES, AND

ALSO INCLUDED $50 MILLION FROM THE TERMINATION OF A PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION

AGREEMENT IN THE HEALTH CARE SEGMENT.  A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE

THAT RELATED TO A CHANGE IN THE COMPANY'S REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICY WAS ALSO

RECORDED IN 2000, REDUCING NET INCOME BY $75 MILLION.

PRO FORMA AMOUNTS (EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING ITEMS).

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DISCUSSION OF RESULTS EXCLUDING SIGNIFICANT NON-

RECURRING ITEMS PROVIDES A USEFUL ANALYSIS OF ONGOING OPERATING TRENDS.  THE

PRO FORMA AMOUNTS (WHICH EXCLUDE NON-RECURRING ITEMS) THAT FOLLOW ARE NOT IN

ACCORDANCE WITH, OR PREFERABLE TO, AMOUNTS DETERMINED IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  REFERENCE SHOULD BE MADE TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES FOR ADDITIONAL

INFORMATION CONCERNING NON-RECURRING ITEMS, AND FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON

AMOUNTS DETERMINED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES.  THERE IS DISCUSSION OF OPERATING MEASURES THAT EXCLUDE NON-

RECURRING ITEMS WITHIN THIS "OPERATING RESULTS" SECTION. THE DETERMINATION OF

NON-RECURRING ITEMS MAY NOT BE COMPARABLE TO SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY

OTHER COMPANIES. AN (#) IS USED TO CROSS-REFERENCE SUCH SUBSEQUENT DISCUSSION

TO THIS PARAGRAPH.

EXCLUDES ACQUISITION AND DIVESTITURE IMPACTS) INCREASED 1.0 PERCENT.

ACQUISITIONS INCREASED NET SALES BY FOUR-TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT.  SELLING PRICES

WERE UP TWO-TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT. CHANGES IN THE VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR

INCREASED WORLDWIDE NET SALES BY ONE-TENTH OF ONE PERCENT. IN THE UNITED

STATES, NET SALES FOR 2002 TOTALED $7.426 BILLION, WITH CORE VOLUME DOWN 1.6

PERCENT.  INTERNATIONAL NET SALES FOR 2002 TOTALED $8.906 BILLION (UP 4.4

PERCENT IN U.S. DOLLARS), WITH CORE VOLUME UP 3.2 PERCENT.

IN 2001, CORE VOLUME DECLINED BY 3.5 PERCENT. ACQUISITIONS INCREASED NET SALES

BY 2.6 PERCENT.  THE STRONGER U.S. DOLLAR REDUCED SALES BY 3.3 PERCENT.  IN THE

UNITED STATES, SALES TOTALED $7.523 BILLION, DOWN 4 PERCENT FROM 2000.  U.S.

CORE VOLUME DECLINED 6.8 PERCENT.  INTERNATIONALLY, SALES TOTALED $8.531

BILLION, DOWN 3.8 PERCENT FROM 2000.  INTERNATIONAL CORE VOLUME DECLINED SEVEN-

COST OF SALES FOR 2002 WAS 52.0 PERCENT OF NET SALES, DOWN 2.5 PERCENTAGE

POINTS FROM 2001. EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING CHARGES, COST OF SALES FOR 2002 WAS

51.3 PERCENT(#) OF SALES, DOWN 1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 2001. GROSS MARGINS

WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY IMPROVED PLANT EFFICIENCIES, LOWER RAW MATERIAL

COSTS AND 3M'S GLOBAL SOURCING INITIATIVE.  IN 2001, SLOWING WORLDWIDE MARKET

DEMAND AND NEGATIVE CURRENCY IMPACTS REDUCED GROSS MARGINS.  COST OF SALES

INCLUDES MANUFACTURING, ENGINEERING AND FREIGHT COSTS.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A;) EXPENSES FOR 2002 WERE 22.8 PERCENT

OF NET SALES, DOWN 2.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM 2001.  EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING

CHARGES, SG&A; EXPENSES WERE 22.3 PERCENT(#) OF NET SALES, A DECREASE OF

1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT FROM 2001. EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING ITEMS, SG&A;

SPENDING TOTALED $3.643 BILLION(#) IN 2002, A DECREASE OF 2.5 PERCENT

FROM 2001.  THIS IMPROVEMENT IN SG&A; COSTS WAS THE RESULT OF IMPLEMENTING

SIX SIGMA, INDIRECT COST CONTROL PROGRAMS (CONTROLLING THOSE EXPENSES NOT

DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH 3M PRODUCTS AND SERVICES) AND EMPLOYMENT

REDUCTIONS UNDER THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN APPROVED IN JUNE 2001.  SG&A;

ALSO BENEFITED BY $67 MILLION DUE TO THE CESSATION OF GOODWILL AMORTIZATION

AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSET AMORTIZATION EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002.

EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING CHARGES IN 2001, SG&A; WAS 23.3 PERCENT(#) OF

SALES, WHICH WAS A DECREASE OF THREE-TENTHS OF ONE PERCENTAGE POINT FROM

24

THE PRIOR YEAR.  THIS DECREASE IN 2001 SPENDING WAS DUE TO COST

SAVINGS GENERATED FROM 3M'S INDIRECT COST INITIATIVE AND LOWER EMPLOYMENT

LEVELS.

OPERATING INCOME.

OPERATING INCOME IS USED BY 3M AS ONE OF ITS PRIMARY BUSINESS SEGMENT

PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TOOLS.  OPERATING INCOME EXCLUDES INTEREST EXPENSE,

INTEREST INCOME, THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES AND MINORITY INTEREST.

OPERATING INCOME IN 2002 WAS 18.7 PERCENT OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH 14.2

PERCENT IN 2001.  EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING CHARGES, OPERATING INCOME IN 2002 WAS

19.9 PERCENT(#) OF NET SALES, COMPARED WITH 17.3 PERCENT(#) IN 2001.  ALTHOUGH

THE COMPANY FACED CONTINUED ECONOMIC WEAKNESS, OPERATING INCOME EXCLUDING NON-

RECURRING ITEMS GREW BY $471 MILLION, OR 17.0 PERCENT, FROM 2001. THE CESSATION

OF GOODWILL AMORTIZATION AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSET AMORTIZATION

BENEFITED OPERATING INCOME BY $67 MILLION, WHILE CURRENCY IMPACTS REDUCED

OPERATING INCOME BY AN ESTIMATED $60 MILLION. EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING ITEMS,

2001 OPERATING INCOME TOTALED $2.777 BILLION(#), OR 17.3 PERCENT(#) OF SALES,

COMPARED TO 18.4 PERCENT(#) OF SALES IN 2000.  THIS DECREASE WAS DUE TO SLOWING

WORLDWIDE MARKET DEMAND, AND NEGATIVE CURRENCY EFFECTS.  EXCLUDING NON-

RECURRING ITEMS, OPERATING INCOME MARGINS IN 2002 WERE 15.9 PERCENT(#) IN THE

UNITED STATES AND 23.2 PERCENT(#) INTERNATIONALLY.

INTEREST EXPENSE AND INCOME.

NET INTEREST EXPENSE (INTEREST EXPENSE LESS INTEREST INCOME) IN 2002 WAS $41

MILLION, WHICH WAS $46 MILLION LOWER THAN THE PRIOR YEAR.  INTEREST EXPENSE WAS

$80 MILLION IN 2002, $124 MILLION IN 2001, AND $111 IN 2000.  DECLINING RATES

ON FLOATING-RATE DEBT DROVE THE REDUCTION IN EXPENSE IN 2002.  THE INCREASE IN

2001 REFLECTED HIGHER AVERAGE DEBT LEVELS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST

RATES.  INTEREST INCOME WAS $39 MILLION IN 2002, $37 MILLION IN 2001 AND $27

MILLION IN 2000.   THE INCREASE IN BOTH 2002 AND 2001 INTEREST INCOME PRIMARILY

RELATED TO LARGER AVERAGE CASH BALANCES.

PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES.

THE WORLDWIDE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE FOR 2002 WAS 32.1 PERCENT, THE SAME AS

2001.  EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING ITEMS, THE WORLDWIDE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE

IN 2002 WAS 32.5 PERCENT(#), DOWN FROM 32.9 PERCENT(#) THE PRIOR YEAR.

EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING ITEMS, THE TAX RATE DECREASE COMPARED TO TOTAL YEAR

2001 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER AVERAGE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 2000 WAS 34.5 PERCENT.  THE EFFECTIVE TAX

RATE DECREASE IN 2001 WHEN COMPARED TO 2000 RELATED TO THE IMPACT OF RECURRING

TAX CREDITS ON LOWER PROFIT LEVELS.

MINORITY INTEREST.

MINORITY INTEREST EXPENSE WAS $65 MILLION IN 2002, $54 MILLION IN 2001 AND $92

MILLION IN 2000.  EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING ITEMS, MINORITY INTEREST WAS $83

MILLION(#) IN 2002 AND $62 MILLION(#) IN 2001. MINORITY INTEREST REPRESENTS THE

ELIMINATION OF THE NON-3M OWNERSHIP INTERESTS, PRIMARILY IN SUMITOMO 3M LIMITED

AND 3M INTER-UNITEK GMBH (IN 2002 AND 2001 ONLY). THE INCREASE IN 2002 RELATED

PRIMARILY TO HIGHER PROFITS IN SUMITOMO 3M AND 3M INTER-UNITEK GMBH.  THE

DECREASE IN 2001 WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER PROFITS IN SUMITOMO 3M.  IN 2003, 3M

EXPECTS LOWER MINORITY INTEREST EXPENSE.  THIS REDUCTION IS EXPECTED DUE TO THE

PURCHASE OF THE MINORITY INTEREST SHARES OF 3M INTER-UNITEK GMBH IN DECEMBER

2002 AND THE PURCHASE OF AN ADDITIONAL 25 PERCENT OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN

SUMITOMO 3M IN EARLY 2003.  REFER TO NOTE 3 IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON THESE ACQUISITIONS.

NET INCOME.

NET INCOME TOTALED $1.974 BILLION, OR $4.99 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED

WITH $1.430 BILLION, OR $3.58 PER DILUTED SHARE, IN 2001, AND $1.782 BILLION,

OR $4.45 PER DILUTED SHARE, IN 2000.  NON-RECURRING CHARGES NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED NET INCOME BY $108 MILLION, OR 27 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE,

IN 2002, $312 MILLION, OR 78 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE, IN 2001, AND

$90 MILLION, OR 23 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE, IN 2000.  THE CESSATION OF

GOODWILL AMORTIZATION AND OTHER INDEFINITE-LIVED ASSET AMORTIZATION

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, INCREASED EARNINGS PER DILUTED SHARE BY 12 CENTS

IN 2002. IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, 3M ESTIMATES THAT CURRENCY EFFECTS REDUCED

NET INCOME BY $35 MILLION (8 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE), $94 MILLION (24 CENTS

PER DILUTED SHARE) AND $55 MILLION (14 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE), RESPECTIVELY.

THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF TRANSLATING PROFITS FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES

INTO U.S. DOLLARS; THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF

GOODS BETWEEN 3M OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD; AND TRANSACTION

GAINS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE

25

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISKS. IN 2002, DERIVATIVE AND OTHER

TRANSACTIONS GAINS AND LOSSES DECREASED NET INCOME BY $25 MILLION.

DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS GAINS AND LOSSES INCREASED NET INCOME BY

$29 MILLION IN 2001 AND INCREASED NET INCOME BY $21 MILLION IN 2000.

EMPLOYMENT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, EMPLOYMENT TOTALED 68,774 PEOPLE, A DECREASE OF 2,895

PEOPLE FROM YEAR-END 2001.  SINCE MARCH 31, 2001, EMPLOYMENT HAS DECLINED BY

APPROXIMATELY 8,900 PEOPLE, WITH 6,900 OF THE DECLINE RELATED TO THE

RESTRUCTURING PLAN, AND 3,500 OF THE DECLINE DUE TO THE INTEGRATION OF

ACQUISITIONS AND ATTRITION.  THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE

CORNING PRECISION LENS, INC. ACQUISITION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002 THAT

ADDED ABOUT 1,500 PEOPLE.  SALES PER EMPLOYEE IN LOCAL CURRENCIES INCREASED

ABOUT 9 PERCENT IN 2002, DECREASED ABOUT 3 PERCENT IN 2001, AND INCREASED ABOUT

7 PERCENT IN 2000.

OPERATING INITIATIVES.

THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS AHEAD WITH ITS FIVE CORPORATE INITIATIVES

(SIX SIGMA, GLOBAL SOURCING EFFECTIVENESS, 3M ACCELERATION, INDIRECT COST

REDUCTION AND EPRODUCTIVITY) AIMED AT ACCELERATING LONG-TERM TOP-LINE GROWTH,

IMPROVING CASH EFFICIENCY AND LOWERING ITS TOTAL COST STRUCTURE.  SIX SIGMA

FOCUSES ON HIGHER GROWTH, LOWER COSTS AND GREATER CASH FLOW.  GLOBAL SOURCING

EFFECTIVENESS GENERATES SAVINGS THROUGH BUYING SMARTER, MANAGING SUPPLY

AGREEMENTS, GEOGRAPHIC BROADENING AND E-APPLICATIONS.  3M ACCELERATION

REALLOCATES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO LARGER, MORE GLOBAL PROJECTS.

INDIRECT COST REDUCTION FOCUSES ON REDUCING COSTS NOT DIRECTLY ASSOCIATED WITH

PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.  IN EPRODUCTIVITY, 3M BELIEVES IT HAS A SIGNIFICANT

DIGITIZATION OPPORTUNITY. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THESE INITIATIVES

PROVIDED A COMBINED BENEFIT ON A PRE-TAX BASIS OF MORE THAN $500 MILLION IN

2002.  IN 2003, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THESE INITIATIVES COULD CONTRIBUTE ON

A PRE-TAX BASIS AN ADDITIONAL $300 MILLION COMPARED TO 2002.  THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT ALL OF THE ESTIMATED COST SAVINGS FROM SUCH ACTIVITIES WILL BE

REALIZED.  NUMEROUS FACTORS MAY CREATE OFFSETS TO THESE SAVINGS, SUCH AS THE

POTENTIAL FOR CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN SALES VOLUMES, NORMAL INCREASES IN

COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, AND OTHER INFLATIONARY PRESSURES.

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES.

DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2001, THE COMPANY DEVELOPED AND ANNOUNCED A

RESTRUCTURING PLAN THAT CONSOLIDATES CERTAIN OPERATIONS AND STREAMLINES THE

ORGANIZATION TO INCREASE SPEED AND PRODUCTIVITY.  IN JUNE 2001, THE COMPANY

COMPLETED THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN AND

OBTAINED APPROVALS FROM THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT. IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2001, THE COMPANY OBTAINED APPROVALS FOR CERTAIN ADDITIONAL ACTIONS.

THESE ACTIONS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED BY JUNE 30, 2002.

IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2002, 3M INCURRED $202 MILLION OF PRE-TAX EXPENSES

RELATING TO THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN. THE 2002 CHARGES RELATE TO EMPLOYEE

SEVERANCE AND BENEFITS ($111 MILLION), ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION ($47 MILLION)

AND OTHER ($44 MILLION).  DURING 2001, 3M INCURRED $569 MILLION OF PRE-TAX

EXPENSES PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN. THE 2001 CHARGES RELATE

TO EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFITS ($472 MILLION), ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION

($80 MILLION) AND OTHER ($17 MILLION). THE COMPANY HAS NOT DISCONTINUED ANY

MAJOR PRODUCT LINES AS A RESULT OF THIS RESTRUCTURING.

IN CONNECTION WITH ITS RESTRUCTURING PLAN, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED A TOTAL OF

ABOUT 6,900 POSITIONS. THESE POSITIONS REPRESENT A WIDE RANGE OF FUNCTIONS

THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY.  OF THE 6,900 EMPLOYMENT REDUCTION FOR THE TOTAL PLAN,

ABOUT 45 PERCENT OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES, 30 PERCENT IN EUROPE, AND THE

BALANCE IN OTHER INTERNATIONAL AREAS. ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS WERE IMPACTED

DIRECTLY AND ALSO INDIRECTLY THROUGH REDUCED ALLOCATIONS OF CORPORATE STAFF

SERVICE COSTS. THE IMPACT OF THE TOTAL RESTRUCTURING, INCLUDING THE ALLOCATED

PORTION OF RESTRUCTURED STAFF SERVICES, IS ESTIMATED BY SEGMENT AS FOLLOWS.

INDUSTRIAL, 35 PERCENT; ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS, 20 PERCENT; TRANSPORTATION,

GRAPHICS AND SAFETY, 20 PERCENT; HEALTH CARE, 10 PERCENT; CONSUMER AND OFFICE,

10 PERCENT; AND SPECIALTY MATERIAL, 5 PERCENT. THESE ESTIMATES ARE PROVIDED

ONLY AS A FRAME OF REFERENCE AS TO THE ORDER OF MAGNITUDE BY SEGMENT. IN ORDER

TO ENHANCE SEGMENT COMPARABILITY AND REFLECT MANAGEMENT'S FOCUS ON ONGOING

OPERATIONS, THESE RESTRUCTURING COSTS HAVE NOT BEEN RECORDED IN THE INDIVIDUAL

BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

26

RELATED TO THIS RESTRUCTURING PLAN, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES IT SAVED ON A PRE-

TAX BASIS $300 MILLION IN 2002, IN ADDITION TO THE $80 MILLION SAVED IN 2001.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES AN ADDITIONAL $120 MILLION OF INCREMENTAL SAVINGS ON A

PRE-TAX BASIS IN 2003.  THE MAJORITY OF THE SAVINGS WILL BE REDUCED EMPLOYEE

COSTS.  THE 2002 SAVINGS WERE SPREAD ACROSS COST OF SALES, SG&A;, AND RESEARCH,

DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES. THE 2001 SAVINGS WERE MOST PROMINENT IN

SG&A;, WITH COST OF SALES BENEFITS OCCURRING IN LATE 2001. NUMEROUS FACTORS MAY

CREATE OFFSETS TO THESE SAVINGS, SUCH AS THE POTENTIAL FOR CONTINUED WEAKNESS

IN SALES VOLUMES, NORMAL INCREASES IN COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS, AND OTHER

INFLATIONARY PRESSURES.

OF THE COMPANY'S REMAINING CURRENT LIABILITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, $30 MILLION

IS CLASSIFIED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES (PAYROLL) AND $18 MILLION IS CLASSIFIED IN

OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY

CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM LIABILITIES $43 MILLION OF ITS 2002 CHARGES AND $124

MILLION OF ITS 2001 CHARGES. SPECIAL TERMINATION PENSION AND MEDICAL BENEFITS,

AGGREGATING $43 MILLION IN 2002 AND $62 MILLION IN 2001, WERE OFFERED TO

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. THESE BENEFITS WILL GENERALLY BE PAID OVER THEIR LIFE

EXPECTANCIES.  IN ADDITION, OF THE $62 MILLION IN SEPARATION PAY THAT WAS

DEFERRED IN 2001, $47 MILLION WAS RECLASSIFIED TO CURRENT IN 2002. THE COMPANY

ALSO RECORDED $3 MILLION OF NON-CASH STOCK OPTION EXPENSE ($8 MILLION IN 2001)

DUE TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES AGE 50 AND OLDER TO RETIREE

STATUS, RESULTING IN A MODIFICATION OF THEIR ORIGINAL STOCK OPTION AWARDS FOR

ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. THE CURRENT LIABILITIES AND A PORTION OF THE NON-CURRENT

LIABILITIES WILL BE FUNDED THROUGH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS, WHILE FUNDING

FOR CERTAIN LONG-TERM SPECIAL TERMINATION PENSION AND MEDICAL LIABILITIES WILL

BE PROVIDED THROUGH ESTABLISHED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT TRUST FUNDS.  THE

MAJORITY OF THE LONG-TERM PORTION OF THE LIABILITY, PRIMARILY SPECIAL

TERMINATION PENSION AND MEDICAL LIABILITIES, IS REFLECTED AS A COMPONENT OF

3M'S PENSION AND MEDICAL TRUST PLANS AS A PORTION OF THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION (ABO).  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 3M'S BENEFIT PLANS REFLECT

APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION OF RESTRUCTURING RELATED LONG-TERM LIABILITIES THAT

HAVE NOT YET BEEN PAID OUT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002.

EXPENSES FROM SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TO NET SALES FOR

2000 AND 2001, WITH NO IMPACT ON OPERATING INCOME.  THIS RECLASSIFICATION

RESULTED IN A REDUCTION IN BOTH ADVERTISING EXPENSE AND NET SALES FOR THESE

YEARS.  THESE RECLASSIFICATIONS WERE REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSUMER AND

OFFICE SEGMENT.

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ALSO RECLASSIFIED NET SALES AND OPERATING

INCOME FOR THE REALIGNMENT OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES FROM THE HEALTH CARE SEGMENT

TO THE CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENT.  THIS ALIGNMENT WILL BEST UTILIZE 3M'S

CONSUMER AND KEY ACCOUNT EXPERTISE TO STRENGTHEN THE POSITION OF CERTAIN BRANDS

IN THE MARKETPLACE.  THESE BUSINESSES HAD NET SALES OF $118 MILLION AND

OPERATING INCOME OF $7 MILLION FOR TOTAL YEAR 2001.  THIS REALIGNMENT HAD NO

IMPACT ON TOTAL COMPANY NET SALES OR OPERATING INCOME.

TRANSPORTATION, GRAPHICS AND SAFETY MARKETS (23 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED SALES).

THIS MARKET PROVIDES PRODUCTS FOR TRANSPORTATION SAFETY, COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS,

RESPIRATORY PROTECTION, OPTICAL DISPLAY, AUTOMOTIVE AND PERSONAL SAFETY.

SALES IN 2002 TOTALED $3.840 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF 8.9 PERCENT FROM 2001.

SALES VOLUMES WERE UP 9.5 PERCENT AND PRICING DECREASED SIX-TENTHS OF A

PERCENT. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED TO $915 MILLION, UP NEARLY 32 PERCENT ON A

REPORTED BASIS (UP ABOUT 30 PERCENT EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING ITEMS IN 2001). THE

GROWTH IN BOTH SALES AND OPERATING INCOME WERE DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY OPTICAL FILM

PRODUCTS.  IN ADDITION, THE OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND AUTOMOTIVE PRODUCTS ALSO

CONTRIBUTED TO THE SALES GROWTH AND OPERATING INCOME IMPROVEMENT.  IN DECEMBER

2002, 3M COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF CORNING PRECISION LENS, INC., A

MANUFACTURER OF LENS SYSTEMS FOR PROJECTION TELEVISIONS.  THIS ACQUISITION WILL

ADD TO THE OPTICAL PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND WILL OPERATE UNDER THE NAME 3M

PRECISION OPTICS, INC.  THIS BUSINESS HAD 2002 NET SALES OF APPROXIMATELY $270

MILLION, BUT SINCE THIS BUSINESS WAS NOT ACQUIRED BY 3M UNTIL DECEMBER 2002,

THERE WAS MINIMAL IMPACT ON 2002 SALES AND OPERATING INCOME OF THE

TRANSPORTATION, GRAPHICS AND SAFETY MARKETS.

HEALTH CARE MARKETS (22 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED SALES).

THIS MARKET PROVIDES INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT IMPROVE PEOPLE'S HEALTH AND WELL-

BEING, INCLUDING DENTAL, MEDICAL SUPPLIES, PHARMACEUTICALS, AND HEALTH

INFORMATION SYSTEMS.  SALES GREW TO $3.560 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF $259

MILLION, OR 7.9 PERCENT, FROM 2001. SALES VOLUMES WERE UP 6.9 PERCENT AND

PRICING INCREASED EIGHT-TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT. VOLUME AND PRICE BOTH WERE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY GENERIC COMPETITION FOR 3M'S BRANDED TAMBOCOR BRAND

PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCT.  TRANSLATION HAD A POSITIVE TWO-TENTHS OF A PERCENT

IMPACT ON HEALTH CARE MARKET SALES IN 2002. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED TO

$900 MILLION, UP 19.5 PERCENT ON A REPORTED BASIS (UP ABOUT 18 PERCENT

EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING ITEMS IN 2001).  3M'S MEDICAL SUPPLIES, DENTAL

AND PHARMACEUTICAL PRODUCTS LED THE SALES AND OPERATING INCOME GROWTH.

IN DECEMBER 2002, 3M ACQUIRED THE REMAINING 43 PERCENT OUTSTANDING SHARES

OF 3M INTER-UNITEK GMBH (PARENT COMPANY OF 3M ESPE DENTAL AG).  SINCE

THESE RESULTS HAVE BEEN FULLY CONSOLIDATED SINCE 2001 (WHEN 3M ACQUIRED

57 PERCENT OF THIS BUSINESS), THIS ADDITIONAL ACQUISITION OF THE REMAINING

28

SHARES HAD NO IMPACT ON 2002 SALES OR OPERATING INCOME OF THE HEALTH CARE

MARKETS SEGMENT.

IN THE PHARMACEUTICAL BUSINESS, AN AGREEMENT WAS REACHED WITH ELI LILLY AND

COMPANY IN SEPTEMBER OF 2001 TO COLLABORATE ON RESIQUIMOD, AN INVESTIGATIONAL

COMPOUND FOR THE TREATMENT OF GENITAL HERPES. 3M RECEIVED $100 MILLION IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001 FROM LILLY IN CONSIDERATION FOR RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED ON A PRO-RATA BASIS OVER THE

SERVICE PERIOD.  3M RECOGNIZED $43 MILLION OF REVENUE RELATING TO THIS

AGREEMENT IN 2002 AND $7 MILLION OF REVENUE IN 2001. ON FEBRUARY 24, 2003, 3M

JOINTLY ANNOUNCED WITH LILLY SUSPENSION OF CLINICAL TRIALS OF RESIQUIMOD

BECAUSE PRELIMINARY DATA FROM RECENTLY COMPLETED PHASE III TRIALS SUGGESTED

THE DOSING OF RESIQUIMOD USED IN THE STUDIES WOULD NOT ACHIEVE ADEQUATE

EFFICACY.  THE DATA DID NOT INDICATE ANY SAFETY CONCERNS WITH THE DRUG. 3M AND

LILLY ARE WORKING TO DETERMINE WHETHER TO CONDUCT ADDITIONAL CLINICAL TRIALS

ON RESIQUIMOD FOR GENITAL HERPES.  MEANWHILE, THE BROADER FAMILY OF IMMUNE

RESPONSE MODIFIERS (IRMS) CONTINUES TO PROGRESS.  ON MARCH 3, 2003, 3M

ANNOUNCED POSITIVE CLINICAL RESULTS IN PIVOTAL PHASE III STUDIES OF ALDARA

BRAND (IMIQUIMOD) CREAM 5%, AN IMMUNE RESPONSE MODIFIER (IRM), FOR MULTIPLE

ACTINIC KERATOSES (AK) AND SUPERFICIAL BASAL CELL CARCINOMA (SBCC).  THESE

POTENTIALLY SERIOUS SKIN CONDITIONS ARE A DIRECT RESULT OF CUMULATIVE SUN

EXPOSURE. WITH THESE PHASE III RESULTS ON ALDARA, 3M PHARMACEUTICALS IS ON

SCHEDULE FOR MID-YEAR 2003 FDA SUBMISSIONS OF THE SUPPLEMENTAL NEW DRUG

APPLICATIONS.

INDUSTRIAL MARKETS (20 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED SALES).

THIS MARKET PROVIDES TAPES, COATED AND NONWOVEN ABRASIVES, AND SPECIALTY

ADHESIVES.  SALES TOTALED $3.225 BILLION, AN INCREASE OF EIGHT-TENTHS OF ONE

PERCENT.  VOLUME DECREASED 0.3 PERCENT, REFLECTING CONTINUING WEAKNESS IN MOST

MANUFACTURING SECTORS OF THE ECONOMY. PRICING INCREASED 1.5 PERCENT IN 2002 AND

TRANSLATION NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SALES BY FOUR-TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT.  OPERATING

INCOME INCREASED TO $563 MILLION, AN INCREASE OF ABOUT 8.5 PERCENT, DUE TO

EFFECTIVE COST CONTROL AND INCREASED EFFICIENCIES. AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET,

ENGINEERED ADHESIVES, AND INDUSTRIAL TAPE PRODUCTS ALL SHOWED GOOD SALES GROWTH

AND OPERATING INCOME IMPROVEMENT. COATED ABRASIVES AND 3M'S PACKAGING SYSTEMS

PRODUCTS WERE HARDEST HIT BY THE WEAKNESS IN THE MANUFACTURING SECTOR OF THE

ECONOMY.  DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002, 3M FINALIZED THE ACQUISITION OF

CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF EMTECH EMULSION TECHNOLOGIES, INC. AND EMTECH

MANUFACTURING CORPORATION. ACQUISITIONS DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON

2002 SALES FOR THIS SEGMENT (LESS THAN 1 PERCENT), AND DID NOT MATERIALLY

IMPACT OPERATING INCOME.

CONSUMER AND OFFICE MARKETS (17 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED SALES).

THE CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENT SERVES MARKETS THAT INCLUDE CONSUMER, OFFICE,

EDUCATION, FOODSERVICE AND OTHER IMPORTANT MARKETS. SALES IN 2002 DECREASED

NINE-TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT TO $2.792 BILLION. VOLUMES DECREASED 1.6 PERCENT IN

2002.  THE DECREASE IN VOLUME REFLECTED CONTINUED OFFICE WORKER LAY-OFFS AND

INVENTORY CONTRACTION IN THE RETAIL CHANNEL AFFECTING OFFICE SUPPLIES.

INCREASED PRICING HAD A POSITIVE TWO-TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT IMPACT, AND

TRANSLATION INCREASED SALES BY FIVE-TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT.  OPERATING INCOME

INCREASED TO $514 MILLION, UP MORE THAN 13 PERCENT FOR THE YEAR.  CONSTRUCTION

AND HOME IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS POSTED STRONG SALES GROWTH AND OPERATING INCOME

IMPROVEMENT FOR THE YEAR.  3M'S HOME CARE AND OFFICE SUPPLY PRODUCTS ALSO

POSTED STRONG OPERATING INCOME IMPROVEMENT. SIX SIGMA AND COSTS SAVINGS FROM

OTHER 3M INITIATIVES DROVE THE OPERATING INCOME IMPROVEMENT.

ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS MARKETS (12 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED SALES).

THIS SEGMENT SUPPLIES CONNECTING, SPLICING, INSULATING AND PROTECTIVE PRODUCTS

FOR THE ELECTRONICS, COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRICAL INDUSTRIES.  SALES IN 2002

TOTALED $1.914 BILLION, DOWN 11.9 PERCENT FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.  VOLUMES WERE

DOWN 11.3 PERCENT IN 2002. THIS DECREASE IN VOLUMES REFLECTED OVERALL SOFTNESS

IN THE TELECOM MARKETS.  PRICING DECREASED SALES BY EIGHT-TENTHS OF ONE

PERCENT, AND TRANSLATION INCREASED SALES BY TWO-TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED TO $265 MILLION, UP ABOUT 21.5 PERCENT ON A REPORTED

BASIS (UP ABOUT 18 PERCENT EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING ITEMS IN 2001).  OPERATING

INCOME GROWTH WAS BROAD-BASED, EXCEPT FOR WEAKNESS IN THE TELECOM MARKETS.

29

SPECIALTY MATERIAL MARKETS (6 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED SALES).

THIS SEGMENT PROVIDES HIGH-VALUE MATERIALS FOR DEMANDING APPLICATIONS IN

CHEMICAL PROCESSING, AUTOMOTIVE, ELECTRONICS, TELECOMMUNICATIONS AND OTHER

INDUSTRIES.  SALES TOTALED $953 MILLION IN 2002, A DECREASE OF 6.8 PERCENT FROM

2001, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE PHASE-OUT OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY USED TO

PRODUCE REPELLENTS AND SURFACTANT PRODUCTS.  IN ADDITION, WEAKER SALES IN

ELECTRONICS END-MARKETS CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN SALES.  VOLUME DECREASED

7.7 PERCENT IN 2002.  PRICING CHANGES DID NOT IMPACT 2002 SALES, AND

TRANSLATION INCREASED SALES BY NINE-TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT. PRODUCTS IN 3M'S

INDUSTRIAL MINERALS AND DYNEON OPERATIONS BOTH EXPERIENCED IMPROVEMENTS IN

SALES GROWTH AND OPERATING INCOME FOR 2002.  OPERATING INCOME TOTALED $136

MILLION, DOWN NEARLY 4 PERCENT. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING INCOME WAS MAINLY THE

RESULT OF THE PREVIOUSLY-MENTIONED PHASE OUT OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY.

THIS PHASE OUT WAS ANNOUNCED IN MAY 2000, AND SUBSTANTIALLY IMPLEMENTED IN THAT

YEAR; ADDITIONAL STEPS WERE TAKEN IN 2001 AND 2002.  FOR RELATED DEVELOPMENTS,

REFER TO THE "ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS" SECTION IN PART I, ITEM 3, LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS.

NON-RECURRING OPERATING INCOME GAINS IN 2000 OF $135 MILLION WERE LARGELY

RELATED TO CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED ASSET DISPOSITIONS, PRINCIPALLY THE SALE

OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE EQUITY SECURITIES. OPERATING INCOME IN 2000 ALSO INCLUDED

A $50 MILLION GAIN FROM THE TERMINATION OF A PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENT IN

THE HEALTH CARE SEGMENT.

PERFORMANCE BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA

FINANCIAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING DISCUSSION OF NON-RECURRING ITEMS, RELATED TO

3M OPERATIONS IN VARIOUS GEOGRAPHIC AREAS IS PROVIDED IN NOTE 13 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  SOME OF THE PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS SOLD BY

3M'S INTERNATIONAL COUNTRIES TO THIRD PARTIES ARE EXPORTED BACK TO THE UNITED

STATES AND OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD.  THUS, THE NET SALES GROWTH BY GEOGRAPHY

MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF END-USER CONSUMPTION IN THE LOCAL COUNTRY.  NON-

RECURRING PRE-TAX LOSSES OF $202 MILLION IN 2002 AND $504 MILLION IN 2001,

PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE RESTRUCTURING, ARE INCLUDED IN ELIMINATIONS AND OTHER

(NOT ASSIGNED TO A SPECIFIC GEOGRAPHIC AREA).

UNITED STATES (45 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED SALES).

SALES IN THE UNITED STATES TOTALED $7.426 BILLION, DOWN 1.3 PERCENT FROM 2001.

U.S. CORE VOLUME DECLINED 1.6 PERCENT. OPERATING INCOME WAS UP 14.8 PERCENT.

WEAK OVERALL SALES IN ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS, SPECIALTY MATERIAL AND

INDUSTRIAL SEGMENTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GOOD GROWTH IN THE HEALTH CARE AND

CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENTS.

EUROPE AND MIDDLE EAST (25 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED SALES).

SALES IN EUROPE AND THE MIDDLE EAST TOTALED $4.035 BILLION, UP 1.9 PERCENT FROM

2001. VOLUME DECREASED 3.5 PERCENT AND SELLING PRICES WERE UP TWO-TENTHS OF ONE

PERCENT.  CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED SALES BY 5.2 PERCENT. THE SIGNIFICANT

DOWNTURN IN THE TELECOM INDUSTRY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED EUROPE'S SALES.  HOWEVER,

HIGHER GROWTH IN THE HEALTH CARE SEGMENT PROVIDED SOME OFFSET TO THE TELECOM

IMPACT.  DESPITE THE DECREASE IN VOLUMES, 2002 OPERATING INCOME INCREASED BY 20

PERCENT.  OPERATING INCOME WAS 17.0 PERCENT OF SALES, COMPARED WITH 14.4

PERCENT OF SALES IN 2001.

ASIA PACIFIC (21 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED SALES).

SALES IN ASIA PACIFIC TOTALED $3.431 BILLION, UP 12.8 PERCENT FROM 2001.

VOLUME IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA INCREASED 14.4 PERCENT, DRIVEN BY THE

TRANSPORTATION, GRAPHICS AND SAFETY, HEALTH CARE AND INDUSTRIAL SEGMENTS.

SELLING PRICES DECREASED 1.7 PERCENT, WHILE CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED

SALES BY ONE-TENTH OF ONE PERCENT. OPERATING INCOME WAS 29.4 PERCENT OF SALES,

UP FROM 26.5 PERCENT IN 2001.  IN JAPAN, HOME OF 3M'S LARGEST INTERNATIONAL

COMPANY, VOLUME INCREASED 7.5 PERCENT. VOLUME IN THE REMAINDER OF THE ASIA

PACIFIC REGION INCREASED ABOUT 21 PERCENT.

LATIN AMERICA, CANADA AND AFRICA (9 PERCENT OF CONSOLIDATED SALES).

SALES IN LATIN AMERICA, CANADA AND AFRICA COMBINED TOTALED $1.392 BILLION, DOWN

6.8 PERCENT FROM 2001.  IN LATIN AMERICA, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 5.3

PERCENT.  CURRENCY REDUCED LATIN AMERICA SALES BY 16.4 PERCENT.  ECONOMIC AND

POLITICAL INSTABILITY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED SALES IN MANY PARTS OF LATIN AMERICA

DURING 2002.  IN CANADA, VOLUME INCREASED 4.6 PERCENT.  SELLING PRICES

INCREASED NINE-TENTHS OF ONE PERCENT, WHILE TRANSLATION DECREASED 1.1 PERCENT.

OPERATING INCOME FOR LATIN AMERICA, CANADA AND AFRICA WAS 28.0 PERCENT OF

SALES, UP FROM 24.1 PERCENT IN 2001.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, REMAINS

STRONG. VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING CASH AND SHORT-TERM DEBT, CAN

FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MONTH TO MONTH DEPENDING ON SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY

NEEDS. WORKING CAPITAL (DEFINED AS CURRENT ASSETS MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES)

TOTALED $1.602 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, DECREASING $185 MILLION FROM YEAR-

END 2001.

THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE TURNOVER INDEX (DEFINED AS QUARTERLY NET SALES

MULTIPLIED BY 4 DIVIDED BY ENDING NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE) TOTALED 6.55 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, AN IMPROVEMENT FROM 6.22 AT YEAR-END 2001.  RECEIVABLES

INCREASED $45 MILLION COMPARED WITH YEAR-END 2001, WITH CURRENCY TRANSLATION

INCREASING THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE BY $147 MILLION (DUE TO THE WEAKER

U.S. DOLLAR).  THE INVENTORY TURNOVER INDEX (DEFINED AS QUARTERLY FACTORY COST

EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING AMOUNTS MULTIPLIED BY 4 DIVIDED BY ENDING INVENTORY)

WAS 4.17 AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, AN IMPROVEMENT FROM 3.76 AT YEAR-END 2001.

INVENTORIES DECLINED $160 MILLION COMPARED WITH YEAR-END 2001, DESPITE CURRENCY

TRANSLATION INCREASING THE INVENTORY BALANCE BY $88 MILLION COMPARED WITH

DECEMBER 31, 2001.

CASH FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $2.992 BILLION IN 2002,

$3.078 BILLION IN 2001 AND $2.326 BILLION IN 2000. CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING

ACTIVITIES CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. PENSION FUNDING

DECISIONS, TAX TIMING DIFFERENCES AND OTHER ITEMS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT

CASH FLOWS. IN 2002, 3M FUNDED CERTAIN EMPLOYEE PENSION PLANS BY NEARLY $1.1

BILLION, PRIMARILY IN THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTERS OF 2002 (DISCUSSED IN MORE

DETAIL LATER), RESULTING IN A DECREASE OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS.  CASH FLOW

BENEFITS RESULTED FROM INCREASED PROFITABILITY, WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS

AND TAX TIMING DIFFERENCES.  IN 2001, WORKING CAPITAL REDUCTIONS DROVE THE

INCREASE.   AS DISCUSSED IN THE "PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT" SECTION OF

THIS REPORT, 3M RECEIVED $100 MILLION FROM ELI LILLY AND COMPANY IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2001 RELATING TO A PHARMACEUTICAL AGREEMENT. IN 2002, 3M MADE $306

MILLION OF PAYMENTS UNDER THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN, COMPARED WITH $159 MILLION IN

2001. IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, 3M'S INSURANCE RECOVERIES, NET OF CLAIMS PAID,

RELATED TO THE BREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION TOTALED $51 MILLION, $101 MILLION AND

$49 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. MOST OF THE COMPANY'S IMPLANT LIABILITIES HAVE BEEN

PAID; ACCORDINGLY, RECEIPT OF RELATED INSURANCE RECOVERIES WILL INCREASE FUTURE

CASH FLOWS.  FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION, REFER TO PART I, ITEM 3, LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS, OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

GLOBALLY, 3M'S PENSION PLAN ASSETS HAVE DECLINED DUE TO RECENT EQUITY MARKET

WEAKNESS WHILE PENSION LIABILITIES AND BENEFIT PAYMENTS HAVE CONTINUED TO

GROW. 3M'S PENSION PLAN ASSETS WERE BELOW 3M'S ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION

(ABO) AT ITS MOST RECENT PLAN MEASUREMENT DATES FOR CERTAIN PLANS.  ACCOUNTING

RULES REQUIRE THAT, IF ABO EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF PENSION PLAN ASSETS, THE

EMPLOYER MUST RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY THAT IS AT LEAST EQUAL TO THE UNFUNDED

ABO. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, 3M RECORDED A MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY

ADJUSTMENT THAT IMPACTED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME BY $1.056 BILLION (NET OF

TAX). OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME CAPTURES CERTAIN ITEMS EXCLUDED FROM NET

INCOME, SUCH AS CHANGES IN CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION, UNREALIZED GAINS OR LOSSES

RELATED TO AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE EQUITY SECURITIES, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL MINIMUM

PENSION LIABILITIES NOT YET RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME

AS PART OF NET PENSION COST.  OTHER BALANCE SHEET ACCOUNTS IMPACTED BY THIS

INCLUDED DEFERRED TAX ASSETS (INCREASE OF $666 MILLION), UNFUNDED PENSION

ASSETS (DECREASE OF $1.185 BILLION), PENSION AND OTHER LIABILITIES (INCREASE

OF $641 MILLION), AND AN INTANGIBLE ASSET RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED PRIOR

SERVICE COSTS (INCREASE OF $104 MILLION).  IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002, THE

COMPANY'S U.S. PENSION CONTRIBUTION OF $789 MILLION RESULTED IN AN INCREASE IN

PREPAID PENSION ASSETS AND AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION IN

DEFERRED INCOME TAX LIABILITIES. FUTURE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS WILL DEPEND ON

MARKET CONDITIONS.  IN LOOKING AT A NUMBER OF DIFFERENT SCENARIOS, 3M IS

CONFIDENT ITS STRONG CASH FLOW AND BALANCE SHEET WILL ALLOW IT TO FUND FUTURE

PENSION NEEDS WITHOUT COMPROMISING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.

CASH USED IN INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $1.927 BILLION IN 2002,

COMPARED WITH $1.050 BILLION IN 2001 AND $1.373 BILLION IN 2000.

PURCHASES OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT TOTALED $763 MILLION IN

2002, $980 MILLION IN 2001, AND $1.115 BILLION IN 2000. THESE INVESTMENTS

ARE HELPING TO MEET PRODUCT DEMAND AND INCREASE MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY.

3M EXPECTS TO SPEND APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION IN 2003 ON PURCHASES OF

34

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.  PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT TOTALED $82 MILLION, DOWN FROM APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION IN

BOTH 2001 AND 2000.

CASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES TOTALED $1.258 BILLION IN 2002, $218

MILLION IN 2001 AND $472 MILLION IN 2000.  3M COMPLETED TWO SIGNIFICANT

TRANSACTIONS IN 2002. FIRST, 3M PURCHASED CORNING PRECISION LENS, INC. FOR

APPROXIMATELY $850 MILLION, OR APPROXIMATELY $680 MILLION AFTER CONSIDERING THE

NET PRESENT VALUE OF THE JOINT ELECTION TAX BENEFIT UNDER SECTION 338(H)(10),

WHICH ALLOWS GOODWILL TO BE FULLY DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES OVER A PERIOD OF

15 YEARS.  SECOND, 3M PURCHASED THE 43 PERCENT MINORITY SHARES OF 3M INTER-

UNITEK GMBH FOR APPROXIMATELY $304 MILLION.  THE COMPANY ALSO ENTERED INTO

SEVEN OTHER BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN 2002 FOR A TOTAL OF $104 MILLION IN CASH

(NET OF CASH ACQUIRED) AND $35 MILLION OF 3M COMMON STOCK.  REFER TO NOTE 3 IN

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON BUSINESS

COMBINATIONS.

THERE WERE THREE SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN 2001. 3M ACQUIRED

MICROTOUCH SYSTEMS INC., A TOUCH SCREEN MANUFACTURER, FOR $158 MILLION IN CASH,

NET OF CASH ACQUIRED.  3M ALSO ACQUIRED ROBINSON NUGENT, INC., A

TELECOMMUNICATIONS SUPPLIER, IN EXCHANGE FOR 1,124,135 SHARES OF 3M COMMON

STOCK. THE COMPANY ALSO COMBINED ITS GERMAN DENTAL BUSINESS (3M INTER-UNITEK

GMBH, AN EXISTING 3M SUBSIDIARY) WITH ESPE DENTAL AG, A DENTAL PRODUCTS

MANUFACTURER.  3M INTER-UNITEK GMBH ACQUIRED 100 PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING

SHARES OF ESPE DENTAL AG IN EXCHANGE FOR 43 PERCENT OWNERSHIP IN 3M INTER-

UNITEK GMBH AND $25 MILLION, NET OF CASH ACQUIRED (SEE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION

CONCERNING THE PURCHASE OF THE REMAINING 3M INTER-UNITEK GMBH MINORITY SHARES

IN 2002).  ACQUISITION ACTIVITY IN 2001 ALSO INCLUDED THE PURCHASE, FOR LESS

THAN $50 MILLION, OF FIVE SMALLER COMPANIES THAT HAD COMBINED ANNUAL NET SALES

OF LESS THAN $50 MILLION IN TOTAL.

ACQUISITIONS IN 2000 TOTALED $472 MILLION IN CASH (NET OF CASH ACQUIRED), PLUS

128,994 SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK.  THIS INCLUDED THE PURCHASE OF 91 PERCENT

(SUBSEQUENTLY INCREASED TO 99 PERCENT) OF QUANTE AG (A TELECOMMUNICATIONS

SUPPLIER); THE PURCHASE OF THE MULTI-LAYER INTEGRATED CIRCUIT PACKAGING LINE OF

W.L. GORE AND ASSOCIATES; AND THE ACQUISITION OF SEVEN SMALLER BUSINESSES.

THESE SEVEN SMALLER BUSINESSES HAD A COMBINED PURCHASE PRICE OF LESS THAN $125

MILLION AND COMBINED ANNUAL NET SALES OF LESS THAN $75 MILLION.

THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS.  IN JANUARY 2003,

3M ENTERED INTO TWO ADDITIONAL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, NEITHER OF WHICH IMPACTED

2002 OPERATING RESULTS OR THE BALANCE SHEET AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. 3M

PURCHASED AN ADDITIONAL 25 PERCENT SHARE OF SUMITOMO 3M LIMITED, A JAPANESE

COMPANY, FROM NEC CORPORATION FOR APPROXIMATELY $375 MILLION.  PRIOR TO THIS

PURCHASE, 3M CONTROLLED AND OWNED 50 PERCENT OF SUMITOMO 3M LIMITED AND FULLY

CONSOLIDATED BOTH SUMITOMO 3M LIMITED'S BALANCE SHEET AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, WITH A PROVISION FOR THE MINORITY INTEREST THAT DID NOT HAVE

PARTICIPATING RIGHTS.  IN A SMALLER ACQUISITION, 3M ACQUIRED 100 PERCENT OF THE

COMMON SHARES OF SOLVAY FLUOROPOLYMERS, WHICH HAS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES

LOCATED IN DECATUR, ALABAMA.  ALTHOUGH PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN

FINALIZED, 3M EXPECTS NO IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGES RESULTING

FROM THESE ACQUISITIONS.

PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS TOTALED $7 MILLION IN 2002 AND $12 MILLION IN BOTH

2001 AND 2000.  THESE PURCHASES INCLUDE ADDITIONAL SURVIVOR BENEFIT INSURANCE

AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

TOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WAS $3.377 BILLION, UP FROM $2.893 BILLION AT

YEAR-END 2001. TOTAL DEBT WAS 36 PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL, COMPARED WITH 32

PERCENT AT YEAR-END 2001. THE COMPANY FINANCED THE FOURTH QUARTER 2002 CORNING

PRECISION LENS, INC. ACQUISITION THROUGH A COMBINATION OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS

AND OTHER FINANCING.  OTHER FOURTH QUARTER 2002 EVENTS THAT IMPACTED THE DEBT

TO CAPITAL RATIO INCLUDED THE PURCHASE BY 3M OF THE REMAINING 43 PERCENT

MINORITY INTEREST IN 3M INTER-UNITEK GMBH FOR CASH OF $304 MILLION, AND THE

EQUITY REDUCTION FROM THE MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT EFFECT ON OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF APPROXIMATELY $1.1 BILLION.  FOR THESE REASONS, 3M'S

DEBT TO CAPITAL FOR YEAR-END 2002 TOTALED 36 PERCENT AND MAY STAY CLOSE TO

THAT LEVEL FOR THE NEXT QUARTER OR TWO.  THE DEBT TO CAPITAL RATIO IS EXPECTED

TO RETURN TO THE 30 TO 35 PERCENT RANGE SHORTLY THEREAFTER.

35

IN 2002, THE CASH FLOW DECREASE IN NET SHORT-TERM DEBT OF $204 MILLION INCLUDES

THE PORTION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR

LESS. THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT OF $497 MILLION PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE REPAYMENT

OF COMMERCIAL PAPER HAVING ORIGINAL MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS.  THE

PROCEEDS FROM DEBT OF $1.146 BILLION INCLUDED $550 MILLION RELATED TO ISSUANCE

OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT IN 2002 (DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL LATER), $400 MILLION

RELATED TO A 2002 DEBT ISSUANCE UNDER THE MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM, AND THE

BALANCE WAS LARGELY COMPRISED OF COMMERCIAL PAPER HAVING ORIGINAL MATURITIES

GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS. IN 2001, BOTH REPAYMENT AND PROCEEDS FROM DEBT

AMOUNTS INCLUDE LARGE AMOUNTS RELATED TO COMMERCIAL PAPER HAVING ORIGINAL

MATURITIES GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS.

ON NOVEMBER 15, 2002, 3M SOLD $639 MILLION IN AGGREGATE FACE AMOUNT OF 30-YEAR

ZERO COUPON SENIOR NOTES (THE "CONVERTIBLE NOTES") THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO

SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK. THE GROSS PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING, TO BE USED

FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, WERE $550 MILLION ($540 MILLION NET OF

ISSUANCE COSTS). THE TERMS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES INCLUDE A YIELD TO

MATURITY OF .50 PERCENT AND AN INITIAL CONVERSION PREMIUM OF 40 PERCENT OVER

THE $130.00 CLOSING PRICE OF 3M COMMON STOCK ON NOVEMBER 14, 2002. IF CERTAIN

CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION (RELATING TO THE CLOSING COMMON STOCK PRICES OF 3M

EXCEEDING CERTAIN THRESHOLDS FOR SPECIFIED PERIODS) ARE MET, HOLDERS MAY

CONVERT EACH OF THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES INTO 4.7301 SHARES OF 3M

COMMON STOCK IN ANY CALENDAR QUARTER COMMENCING AFTER MARCH 31, 2003.  IF THE

CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, AND 3M ELECTS NOT TO SETTLE IN CASH, THE

30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE IN THE AGGREGATE INTO

APPROXIMATELY 3.0 MILLION SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK. 3M MAY REDEEM THE 30-YEAR

ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES AT ANY TIME IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AFTER FIVE YEARS AT

THE GREATER OF THE ACCRETED CONVERSION PRICE OR THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE.

HOLDERS OF THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES HAVE THE OPTION TO REQUIRE 3M

TO PURCHASE THEIR NOTES AT ACCRETED VALUE IN YEARS THREE, FIVE, 10, 15, 20 AND

25.   3M MAY CHOOSE TO PAY THE REDEMPTION PURCHASE PRICE IN CASH AND/OR COMMON

STOCK.  DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A

THREE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING IN NOVEMBER 2002.  THERE WAS NO IMPACT ON 3M'S

2002 DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, AS THE CONVERSION RIGHTS COMMENCE AFTER MARCH

31, 2003.  ON FEBRUARY 14, 2003, 3M REGISTERED THESE CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN A

REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

IN DECEMBER 2000, THE COMPANY ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION OF DEBT

SECURITIES, REMARKETABLE ANNUALLY (WITH A FINAL MATURITY DATE OF DECEMBER

2010), WHICH IS CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM DEBT.  IN OCTOBER 2000, THE COMPANY

FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

RELATING TO THE POTENTIAL OFFERING OF DEBT SECURITIES OF UP TO $1.5 BILLION.

AFTER THE SHELF REGISTRATION BECAME EFFECTIVE, THE COMPANY, IN MAY 2001,

ESTABLISHED UNDER THE SHELF A MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH UP TO

$1.4 BILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MAY BE OFFERED.  3M PLANS TO USE THE NET

PROCEEDS FROM FUTURE ISSUANCES OF DEBT SECURITIES UNDER THESE REGISTRATIONS FOR

GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT OR THE FINANCING OF

POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, $950 MILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM

NOTES HAD BEEN ISSUED UNDER THE MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM AND ANOTHER $56

MILLION OF DEBT SECURITIES HAD BEEN ISSUED DIRECTLY FROM THE SHELF,

AGGREGATING $1.006 BILLION OF OUTSTANDING DEBT SECURITIES ISSUED UNDER THE

SHELF.

THE COMPANY'S LIQUIDITY POSITION REMAINS STRONG.  PRIMARY SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY

NEEDS ARE PROVIDED THROUGH U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER AND EURO COMMERCIAL PAPER

ISSUANCES.  AT YEAR-END 2002, OUTSTANDING TOTAL COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED

TOTALED $494 MILLION AND AVERAGED APPROXIMATELY $455 MILLION DURING 2002.

MEDIUM-TERM NOTE SHELF BORROWING CAPACITY TOTALED $450 MILLION AT YEAR-END

2002.  CREDIT SUPPORT FOR OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER IS PROVIDED BY A $565

MILLION, 364-DAY CREDIT AGREEMENT AMONG A GROUP OF PRIMARY RELATIONSHIP BANKS.

THE FACILITY PROVIDES UP TO $65 MILLION IN LETTERS OF CREDIT ($64 MILLION OF

WHICH WAS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2002). COMMITTED CREDIT FACILITIES

OF $91 MILLION ARE IN PLACE ACROSS SEVERAL INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARY

LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY ALSO HAS UNCOMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT TOTALING $250

36

MILLION.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RENEW THE COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT

FACILITIES IN 2003. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ITS ACCESS TO

THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET WILL BE RESTRICTED.  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

AND CERTAIN OTHER CURRENT ASSETS COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIQUIDITY TO MEET

NEAR TERM OBLIGATIONS, IF NECESSARY.

AT YEAR-END 2002, CERTAIN DEBT AGREEMENTS ($565 MILLION OF SHORT-TERM LINES OF

CREDIT, $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND THE $271 MILLION OF

ESOP DEBT) HAD RATINGS TRIGGERS (BBB-/BAA3 OR LOWER) THAT WOULD REQUIRE

REPAYMENT OF DEBT.  THE COMPANY CURRENTLY HAS AN AA/AA1 RATING.

A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOLLOWS.

CERTAIN UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS RELATE TO TAKE OR PAY CONTRACTS WITH

TERMS IN EXCESS OF ONE YEAR, IN WHICH 3M HAS TYPICALLY GUARANTEED PAYMENT TO

ENSURE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT ARE SOLD TO CUSTOMERS.  THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE CONSIDERATION (PRODUCTS OR SERVICES) FOR A MAJORITY

OF THESE UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS. OTHER CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ARE

NOT SIGNIFICANT. THE ESOP DEBT GUARANTEE IS RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF LONG-

TERM DEBT.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3M'S GUARANTEES OF LOANS WITH THIRD PARTIES, INDEMNIFICATION CONTRACTS, AND

OTHER GUARANTEES ARE ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION. 3M'S ACCRUED

PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITY IS ALSO ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION. 3M

DOES NOT CONSIDER THESE AMOUNTS TO BE SIGNIFICANT.

REPURCHASES OF 3M COMMON STOCK TOTALED $942 MILLION IN 2002, COMPARED WITH

$1.322 BILLION IN 2001 AND $814 MILLION IN 2000. REPURCHASES WERE MADE TO

SUPPORT THE COMPANY'S MANAGEMENT STOCK OPTION PLAN, ITS GENERAL EMPLOYEES'

STOCK PURCHASE PLAN, AND FOR OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES.  IN NOVEMBER 2001, THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $2.5 BILLION OF THE

COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK.  THIS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION IS EFFECTIVE FROM

JANUARY 1, 2002, THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2003. IN 2002, THE COMPANY PURCHASED

APPROXIMATELY 7.9 MILLION SHARES FOR $942 MILLION.

THE REDUCTION IN ANNUAL WEIGHTED AVERAGE DILUTED SHARES OUTSTANDING (INCLUDING

THE EFFECTS OF REPURCHASES, ISSUANCES AND DILUTION) RESULTED IN A BENEFIT OF 6

CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE IN 2002 AND 8 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE IN 2000. THERE

WAS NO IMPACT IN 2001.

CASH DIVIDENDS PAID TO STOCKHOLDERS IN 2002 TOTALED $968 MILLION, OR $2.48 PER

SHARE. 3M HAS PAID DIVIDENDS SINCE 1916.  IN FEBRUARY 2003, THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS INCREASED THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON 3M COMMON STOCK TO 66 CENTS PER

SHARE, EQUIVALENT TO AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF $2.64 PER SHARE. THIS MARKS THE 45TH

CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF DIVIDEND INCREASES.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL DERIVATIVE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF BUSINESS TO MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE, INTEREST RATE RISKS AND

COMMODITY PRICE RISKS.  A FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, COMPOSED OF

SENIOR MANAGEMENT, PROVIDES OVERSIGHT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVE

ACTIVITIES.  THIS COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL RISK POLICIES

AND OBJECTIVES, AND PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT UTILIZATION.

THIS COMMITTEE ALSO ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES FOR CONTROL AND VALUATION, RISK

ANALYSIS, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL, AND ONGOING MONITORING AND REPORTING.

37

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAPS

TO HEDGE AGAINST THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS

DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY MANAGES INTEREST RATE RISKS USING A MIX OF FIXED AND

FLOATING RATE DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE BORROWING COSTS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO

INTEREST RATE SWAPS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY AGREES TO EXCHANGE,

AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND FLOATING INTEREST

AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AN AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT.

THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS,

PRICE PROTECTION SWAPS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

A VARIANCE/CO-VARIANCE STATISTICAL MODELING TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO TEST THE

COMPANY'S EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES AND ASSESS THE

RISK OF LOSS IN AFTER-TAX EARNINGS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVES AND

UNDERLYING EXPOSURES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.  THE MODEL (THIRD-PARTY

BANK DATASET) USED A 95 PERCENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL OVER A 12-MONTH TIME HORIZON.

BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS OF THE COMPANY'S INTEREST RATE RISKS, POSSIBLE CHANGES

IN INTEREST RATES WOULD NOT ADVERSELY IMPACT AFTER-TAX EARNINGS BY A MATERIAL

AMOUNT ($7 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, AND $6 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001).

BASED ON THIS ANALYSIS OF THE PRIMARY FOREIGN EXCHANGE RISKS, POSSIBLE CHANGES

IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT AFTER-TAX EARNINGS BY $40

MILLION ($57 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001).  IN 2002, THE ACTUAL CURRENCY

IMPACT DID NOT EXCEED THE VALUE-AT-RISK AFTER-TAX AMOUNT OF $40 MILLION.  THIS

MODEL ANALYZED MORE THAN 20 DIFFERENT CURRENCIES, BUT DOES NOT PURPORT TO

REPRESENT WHAT ACTUALLY WILL BE EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY.  THIS MODEL DOES

NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN HEDGE TRANSACTIONS, BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THEIR

INCLUSION WOULD NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESULTS.

THE COMPANY IS INCREASINGLY STRIVING TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN ITS MANUFACTURING

AND SOURCING WITH GEOGRAPHIC MARKET SALES, WHICH WILL MOVE COSTS OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES. THIS WILL ALSO HELP MITIGATE THE EFFECTS FROM CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS. IN 2001, THE COMPANY INCREASED THE AMOUNT AND DURATION OF ITS

FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGES TO HELP LESSEN YEAR-OVER-YEAR IMPACTS AND TO IMPROVE

THE PREDICTABILITY OF FUTURE EARNINGS. HOWEVER, THIS HEDGING PROGRAM WILL NOT

MAKE 3M IMMUNE TO CURRENCY IMPACTS.

SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS WAS USED TO ASSESS COMMODITY RISKS.  THE TECHNIQUE USED

EVALUATES THE EFFECT THAT CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE OF COMMODITIES WILL HAVE

ON THE COMPANY'S COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS.  AT YEAR-END 2002 AND 2001,

THE POTENTIAL CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF COMMODITY DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS,

ASSUMING A 10 PERCENT ADVERSE CHANGE IN THE UNDERLYING COMMODITY PRICE, WAS NOT

MATERIAL ($1 MILLION AFTER TAX AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, AND $4 MILLION AFTER TAX

AT DECEMBER 31, 2001).

THE GLOBAL EXPOSURES RELATED TO PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS ARE SUCH

THAT A ONE PERCENT PRICE CHANGE WOULD RESULT IN A PRE-TAX COST OR SAVINGS OF

APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION PER YEAR.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE USED TO

PARTIALLY HEDGE ABOUT ONE PERCENT OF THIS EXPOSURE. THE GLOBAL ENERGY EXPOSURE

IS SUCH THAT A 10 PERCENT PRICE CHANGE WOULD RESULT IN A PRE-TAX COST OR

SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION PER YEAR.  DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE USED

TO PARTIALLY HEDGE ABOUT 15 PERCENT OF THIS ENERGY EXPOSURE.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

IN THE CONTEXT OF ITEM 7A, MARKET RISK REFERS TO THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM

ADVERSE CHANGES IN FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT MARKET RATES AND PRICES,

SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN-CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE

COMPANY DISCUSSES RISK MANAGEMENT IN VARIOUS PLACES THROUGHOUT THIS DOCUMENT,

INCLUDING DISCUSSIONS IN ITEM 7 CONCERNING FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY,

AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS (DEBT, DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND THE

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES ACCOUNTING POLICY).  ALL DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY

IS GOVERNED BY WRITTEN POLICIES, AND A VALUE-AT-RISK ANALYSIS IS PROVIDED FOR

THESE DERIVATIVES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE LEVERAGED DERIVATIVE POSITIONS.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION:  ALL SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. ALL SIGNIFICANT

INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERM "3M" OR

"COMPANY" REFERS TO 3M COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES

OTHERWISE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION:  LOCAL CURRENCIES GENERALLY ARE CONSIDERED THE

FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR

OPERATIONS IN LOCAL-CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS ARE TRANSLATED AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE

RATES.  INCOME AND EXPENSE ITEMS ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE

PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR. CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED AS

A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY.

RECLASSIFICATIONS:  CERTAIN PRIOR PERIOD BALANCE SHEET AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN

RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM WITH THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE

NO. 00-25 (EITF 00-25), "VENDOR INCOME STATEMENT CHARACTERIZATION OF

CONSIDERATION PAID TO A RESELLER OF THE VENDOR'S PRODUCTS."  THIS STATEMENT

ADDRESSED WHETHER CERTAIN CONSIDERATION FROM A VENDOR TO A RESELLER OF THE

VENDOR'S PRODUCTS IS AN ADJUSTMENT TO SELLING PRICES OR A COST.  THIS STATEMENT

DID NOT HAVE ANY EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S NET INCOME OR ITS FINANCIAL POSITION.

THIS ADOPTION RESULTED IN A RECLASSIFICATION OF APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION OF

ADVERTISING EXPENSES FROM SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TO NET

SALES FOR 2000 AND 2001. THESE ADJUSTMENTS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S

CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENT.

USE OF ESTIMATES:  THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE

OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES

DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD.  ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS:  CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH AND

TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS WHEN PURCHASED.

INVESTMENTS: INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE

INSURANCE POLICIES, REAL ESTATE, VENTURE CAPITAL AND EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS.

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-

FOR-SALE ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY.

INVENTORIES:  INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, WITH COST

GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT:  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT

COST, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED INTEREST AND INTERNAL ENGINEERING COSTS.

DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT GENERALLY IS COMPUTED USING THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD BASED ON THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS.

BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES PRIMARILY RANGE FROM 10 TO 40

YEARS, WITH THE MAJORITY IN THE RANGE FROM 20 TO 40 YEARS. MACHINERY AND

EQUIPMENT ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES PRIMARILY RANGE FROM 3 TO 15 YEARS, WITH THE

MAJORITY IN THE RANGE FROM 5 TO 10 YEARS.  FULLY DEPRECIATED ASSETS ARE

RETAINED IN PROPERTY AND ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTS UNTIL DISPOSAL. UPON

DISPOSAL, ASSETS AND RELATED ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE

ACCOUNTS AND THE NET AMOUNT, LESS PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSAL, IS CHARGED OR

CREDITED TO OPERATIONS.  PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT AMOUNTS ARE REVIEWED

FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET (ASSET GROUP) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE.  AN

IMPAIRMENT LOSS WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET

EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM

THE USE OF THE ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT

LOSS TO BE RECORDED IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS' CARRYING VALUE

OVER ITS FAIR VALUE.  FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.

46

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 144.  THIS STATEMENT RETAINS THE REQUIREMENTS

OF SFAS NO. 121 (ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND FOR

LONG-LIVED ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF) TO RECOGNIZE IMPAIRMENTS ON PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, BUT REMOVES GOODWILL FROM ITS SCOPE.  THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO. 144 DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

GOODWILL:  GOODWILL IS THE EXCESS OF COST OF AN ACQUIRED ENTITY OVER THE

AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A BUSINESS

COMBINATION. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002, WITH THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED.  PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2002, GOODWILL WAS AMORTIZED

ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, RANGING FROM 5 TO 40 YEARS. BEGINNING JANUARY 1,

2002, GOODWILL WILL BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, AND WILL BE TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE

THAT WOULD INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY BE IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT TESTING

FOR GOODWILL IS DONE AT A REPORTING UNIT LEVEL.  REPORTING UNITS ARE ONE LEVEL

BELOW THE BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL, BUT CAN BE COMBINED WHEN REPORTING UNITS

WITHIN THE SAME SEGMENT HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS.  3M, AT YEAR-

END 2002, HAD 20 REPORTING UNITS UNDER THE CRITERIA SET FORTH BY SFAS NO. 142.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF GOODWILL RELATES TO AND IS ASSIGNED DIRECTLY TO A

SPECIFIC REPORTING UNIT.  AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS WOULD GENERALLY BE RECOGNIZED

WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNIT'S NET ASSETS EXCEEDS THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT.  THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A

REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED USING EARNINGS FOR THE REPORTING UNIT MULTIPLIED

BY A PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO FOR COMPARABLE INDUSTRY GROUPS, OR BY USING A

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.  THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ASSESSMENT OF ANY

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT UPON ADOPTION OF THIS STANDARD AND UPON ITS ANNUAL

ASSESSMENT AND DETERMINED THAT NO IMPAIRMENTS EXISTED.  PRIOR TO JANUARY 1,

2002, GOODWILL WAS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT IN A MANNER CONSISTENT WITH PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE.  IN NOTE 4 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE

ASSET INFORMATION IS PROVIDED, INCLUDING SUPPLEMENTAL CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT

OF INCOME INFORMATION ON A BOTH A REPORTED AND ADJUSTED BASIS.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS:  INTANGIBLE ASSETS INCLUDE PATENTS, TRADENAMES AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM AN INDEPENDENT PARTY.  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2002, WITH THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 142, INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE

LIFE, NAMELY CERTAIN TRADENAMES, ARE NOT AMORTIZED. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A

DEFINITE LIFE ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS WITH ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIVES RANGING FROM 2 TO 17 YEARS.  INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WILL BE

TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, AND WILL BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN

ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE

THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY BE IMPAIRED.  INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE

LIFE ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT

A CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET (ASSET GROUP) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN

IMPAIRMENT LOSS WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET

EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USED IN DETERMINING THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE ASSET. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECORDED IS

CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUE OVER ITS FAIR VALUE.

FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.

COSTS RELATED TO INTERNALLY DEVELOPED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE EXPENSED AS

INCURRED.

REVENUE RECOGNITION: REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF

OWNERSHIP HAVE SUBSTANTIVELY TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER

LEGAL TITLE HAS TRANSFERRED. THIS CONDITION IS NORMALLY MET WHEN THE PRODUCT

HAS BEEN DELIVERED OR UPON PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES.  THE COMPANY SELLS A WIDE

RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSIFIED BASE OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD AND,

THEREFORE, BELIEVES THERE IS NO MATERIAL CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK.  PRIOR

TO 2000, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED REVENUE UPON SHIPMENT OF GOODS TO CUSTOMERS AND

UPON PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES (REFER TO "CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE"

THAT FOLLOWS).

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE: DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000,

THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES. ESSENTIALLY, THE

NEW POLICIES RECOGNIZE THAT THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP IN MANY

TRANSACTIONS DO NOT SUBSTANTIVELY TRANSFER TO CUSTOMERS UNTIL THE

PRODUCT HAS BEEN DELIVERED, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER LEGAL TITLE HAS

TRANSFERRED. IN ADDITION TO THIS CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING THAT AFFECTED

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS PRODUCT SALES, THE COMPANY HAS REVISED

47

ASPECTS OF ITS ACCOUNTING FOR SERVICES PROVIDED IN SEVERAL OF ITS SMALLER

BUSINESSES. THESE NEW POLICIES ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE GUIDANCE CONTAINED

IN SEC STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN NO. 101.  THE EFFECT OF THESE CHANGES IN

REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES, AS OF JANUARY 1, 2000, IS REPORTED AS THE

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF AN ACCOUNTING CHANGE IN 2000. THIS CHANGE DID NOT HAVE

A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON PRIOR YEAR RESULTS.

ADVERTISING AND MERCHANDISING:  THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS IN THE

YEAR INCURRED.

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE:  THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES DIRECT COSTS OF MATERIALS AND

SERVICES USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE.  AMOUNTS CAPITALIZED

ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A PERIOD OF 3 TO 5 YEARS AND ARE

REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT WITHIN PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT.

ENVIRONMENTAL: ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXISTING CONDITIONS

CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE REVENUES

ARE EXPENSED.  LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED ON AN

UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY

NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES OR THE COMPANY'S COMMITMENT

TO A PLAN OF ACTION.

INCOME TAXES:  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND

LIABILITY APPROACH.  UNDER THIS APPROACH, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES REPRESENT THE

EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING

AMOUNTS AND TAX BASES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION:  THE INTRINSIC VALUE METHOD IS USED

PER APB 25 AND GENERALLY NO COMPENSATION COST IS RECOGNIZED FOR EITHER THE

GENERAL EMPLOYEES' STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (GESPP) OR THE MANAGEMENT STOCK

OWNERSHIP PROGRAM (MSOP). THE GENERAL EMPLOYEES' STOCK PURCHASE PLAN IS

CONSIDERED NON-COMPENSATORY. PRO FORMA AMOUNTS BASED ON THE OPTIONS' ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE, NET OF TAX, AT THE GRANT DATES FOR AWARDS UNDER THE GESPP AND MSOP

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME: TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND THE COMPONENTS OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IS COMPOSED OF FOREIGN CURRENCY

TRANSLATION EFFECTS (INCLUDING HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL

COMPANIES), MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENTS, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND

LOSSES ON CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

EARNINGS PER SHARE:  THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING

FOR CALCULATING BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

DILUTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANY'S STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS.   REFER

TO NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE COMPUTATION OF

BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR EACH YEAR.

48

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES:  EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2001, THE COMPANY

ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES," AS AMENDED BY SFAS NO. 138.

THIS NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD REQUIRES THAT ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS BE

RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE AND ESTABLISHES CRITERIA FOR

DESIGNATION AND EFFECTIVENESS OF HEDGING RELATIONSHIPS.  THE EFFECT OF ADOPTING

THIS STANDARD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS, AND FORWARD AND OPTION

CONTRACTS TO MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE,

INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY MARKET VOLATILITY.  ALL HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE

DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES.  IF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION CEASES TO EXIST,

ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED

ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS.  INSTRUMENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE

ACCOUNTING ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH CHANGES RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING

PURPOSES AND IS NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES.

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JUNE 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 143, "ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS", WHICH MUST BE ADOPTED NO LATER THAN JANUARY 1, 2003. THIS

STATEMENT ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOR RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A

LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION AND THE ASSOCIATED ASSET

RETIREMENT COST.  THE COMPANY IS REVIEWING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THIS STANDARD.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THIS STANDARD TO MATERIALLY IMPACT ITS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN APRIL 2002, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED SFAS NO. 145,

"RESCISSION OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 4, 44, AND 64, AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT

NO. 13, AND TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS."  STATEMENTS 4 AND 64 DEALS WITH THE

EXTINGUISHMENT OF DEBT. STATEMENT 44 DEALS WITH THE ACCOUNTING FOR INTANGIBLE

ASSETS OF MOTOR CARRIERS, AND STATEMENT 13 DEALS WITH ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE CHANGES TO STATEMENTS 4, 44, 64, AND 13 AND THE

TECHNICAL CORRECTIONS WILL NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT ITS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN JULY 2002, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED SFAS NO. 146,

"ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES."  THIS

STANDARD REVIEWS THE ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN EXIT COSTS AND DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES

CURRENTLY SET FORTH IN EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 94-3, "LIABILITY

RECOGNITION FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE TERMINATION BENEFITS AND OTHER COSTS TO EXIT

AN ACTIVITY (INCLUDING CERTAIN COSTS INCURRED IN A RESTRUCTURING)." THE

PRINCIPAL CHANGE RELATES TO THE REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY FOR RECOGNITION OF A

LIABILITY FOR A COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR DISPOSAL ACTIVITY.  THE NEW

STATEMENT REQUIRES THAT A LIABILITY FOR A COST ASSOCIATED WITH AN EXIT OR

DISPOSAL ACTIVITY BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE LIABILITY IS INCURRED VERSUS THE DATE

OF COMMITMENT TO AN EXIT PLAN.  THIS STATEMENT IS EFFECTIVE FOR EXIT AND

DISPOSAL ACTIVITIES INITIATED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002.  THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE

NEW STANDARD TO PRINCIPALLY IMPACT THE ULTIMATE TIMING OF WHEN CHARGES ARE

RECORDED AS OPPOSED TO THE AMOUNT OF THE ULTIMATE CHARGE.

IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED FASB

INTERPRETATION NO. 45, "GUARANTOR'S ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR

GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS." THIS

INTERPRETATION ELABORATES ON THE DISCLOSURES TO BE MADE BY A GUARANTOR IN ITS

INTERIM AND ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ABOUT ITS OBLIGATIONS UNDER CERTAIN

GUARANTEES THAT IT HAS ISSUED.  IT ALSO CLARIFIES (FOR GUARANTEES ISSUED AFTER

JANUARY 1, 2003) THAT A GUARANTOR IS REQUIRED TO RECOGNIZE, AT THE INCEPTION OF

A GUARANTEE, A LIABILITY FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OBLIGATIONS UNDERTAKEN IN

ISSUING THE GUARANTEE.  AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, 3M DOES NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT

GUARANTEES.  DISCLOSURES CONCERNING GUARANTEES ARE FOUND IN NOTE 18 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2002, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED

SFAS NO. 148, "ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION-TRANSITION

AND DISCLOSURE.  AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 123."

THE COMPANY IS CHOOSING TO CONTINUE WITH ITS CURRENT

49

PRACTICE OF APPLYING THE RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT PRINCIPLES

OF APB NO. 25, "ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK ISSUED TO EMPLOYEES." THE COMPANY HAS

ADOPTED THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS NO. 148.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD ISSUED FASB

INTERPRETATION NO. 46, "CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES."  THIS

INTERPRETATION ADDRESSES THE REQUIREMENTS FOR BUSINESS ENTERPRISES TO

CONSOLIDATE RELATED ENTITIES IN WHICH THEY ARE DETERMINED TO BE THE PRIMARY

ECONOMIC BENEFICIARY AS A RESULT OF THEIR VARIABLE ECONOMIC INTERESTS.  THE

INTERPRETATION IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE GUIDANCE IN JUDGING MULTIPLE ECONOMIC

INTERESTS IN AN ENTITY AND IN DETERMINING THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY.  THE

INTERPRETATION OUTLINES DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES IN EXISTENCE PRIOR TO

JANUARY 31, 2003, AND OUTLINES CONSOLIDATION REQUIREMENTS FOR VIES CREATED

AFTER JANUARY 31, 2003.  THE COMPANY HAS REVIEWED ITS MAJOR COMMERCIAL

RELATIONSHIPS AND ITS OVERALL ECONOMIC INTERESTS WITH OTHER COMPANIES

CONSISTING OF RELATED PARTIES, CONTRACTED MANUFACTURING VENDORS, COMPANIES IN

WHICH IT HAS AN EQUITY POSITION, AND OTHER SUPPLIERS TO DETERMINE THE EXTENT

OF ITS VARIABLE ECONOMIC INTEREST IN THESE PARTIES.  THE REVIEW HAS NOT

RESULTED IN A DETERMINATION THAT 3M WOULD BE JUDGED TO BE THE PRIMARY ECONOMIC

BENEFICIARY IN ANY MATERIAL RELATIONSHIPS, OR THAT ANY MATERIAL ENTITIES WOULD

BE JUDGED TO BE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES OF 3M.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT HAS

APPROPRIATELY REPORTED THE ECONOMIC IMPACT AND ITS SHARE OF RISKS OF ITS

COMMERCIAL RELATIONSHIPS THROUGH ITS EQUITY ACCOUNTING ALONG WITH APPROPRIATE

DISCLOSURE OF ITS PURCHASE GUARANTEES AND OTHER COMMITMENTS.

NOTE 2.  RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2001, THE COMPANY DEVELOPED AND ANNOUNCED A

RESTRUCTURING PLAN THAT CONSOLIDATES CERTAIN OPERATIONS AND STREAMLINES THE

ORGANIZATION TO INCREASE SPEED AND PRODUCTIVITY.  IN JUNE 2001, THE COMPANY

COMPLETED THE IDENTIFICATION OF THE SIGNIFICANT ACTIONS TO BE TAKEN AND

OBTAINED APPROVALS FROM THE APPROPRIATE LEVEL OF MANAGEMENT. IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2001, THE COMPANY OBTAINED APPROVALS FOR CERTAIN ADDITIONAL ACTIONS.

THESE ACTIONS WERE SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETED BY JUNE 30, 2002.

IN THE FIRST SIX MONTHS OF 2002, 3M INCURRED $202 MILLION OF PRE-TAX EXPENSE

RELATING TO THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN. THE 2002 CHARGES RELATE TO EMPLOYEE

SEVERANCE AND BENEFITS ($111 MILLION), ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION ($47 MILLION)

AND OTHER ($44 MILLION).  DURING 2001, 3M INCURRED $569 MILLION OF PRE-TAX

EXPENSES PRINCIPALLY RELATED TO THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN. THE 2001 CHARGES RELATE

TO EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE AND BENEFITS ($472 MILLION), ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION

($80 MILLION) AND OTHER ($17 MILLION).

THE SEVERANCE CHARGES WERE TAKEN IN THE QUARTER WHEN MANAGEMENT APPROVED THE

PLANS AND AFTER SEVERANCE BENEFITS HAD BEEN COMMUNICATED TO THE EMPLOYEES. THE

ACCELERATED DEPRECIATION (INCREMENTAL CHARGES RESULTING FROM SHORTENED

DEPRECIABLE LIVES, PRIMARILY RELATED TO DOWNSIZING OR CONSOLIDATING

MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS) RELATED TO ASSETS INCLUDED IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT.  ESTIMATED SALVAGE VALUES WERE BASED ON ESTIMATES OF PROCEEDS UPON

SALE OF CERTAIN AFFECTED ASSETS. THE CHARGES RELATED TO OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES

INCLUDE INCREMENTAL COSTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS FOR ITEMS SUCH AS LEASE

TERMINATION PAYMENTS AND OTHER FACILITY EXIT COSTS (SUCH AS DEMOLITION OF

BUILDINGS, INVENTORY DISPOSALS, OTHER) INCURRED AS A DIRECT RESULT OF THIS

PLAN.

IN CONNECTION WITH ITS RESTRUCTURING PLAN, THE COMPANY ELIMINATED A TOTAL OF

ABOUT 6,900 POSITIONS. THESE POSITIONS REPRESENT A WIDE RANGE OF FUNCTIONS

THROUGHOUT THE COMPANY.  OF THE 6,900 EMPLOYMENT REDUCTION FOR THE TOTAL PLAN,

ABOUT 45 PERCENT OCCURRED IN THE UNITED STATES, 30 PERCENT IN EUROPE, AND THE

BALANCE IN OTHER INTERNATIONAL AREAS. ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS WERE IMPACTED

DIRECTLY AND ALSO INDIRECTLY THROUGH REDUCED ALLOCATIONS OF CORPORATE STAFF

SERVICE COSTS. THE IMPACT OF THE TOTAL RESTRUCTURING, INCLUDING THE ALLOCATED

PORTION OF RESTRUCTURED STAFF SERVICES, IS ESTIMATED BY SEGMENT AS FOLLOWS.

INDUSTRIAL, 35 PERCENT; ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS, 20 PERCENT; TRANSPORTATION,

GRAPHICS AND SAFETY, 20 PERCENT; HEALTH CARE, 10 PERCENT; CONSUMER AND OFFICE,

10 PERCENT; AND SPECIALTY MATERIAL, 5 PERCENT. THESE ESTIMATES ARE PROVIDED

50

OF THE COMPANY'S REMAINING CURRENT LIABILITY AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, $30 MILLION

IS CLASSIFIED IN CURRENT LIABILITIES (PAYROLL) AND $18 MILLION IS CLASSIFIED IN

OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET. THE COMPANY

CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM LIABILITIES $43 MILLION OF ITS 2002 CHARGES AND $124

MILLION OF ITS 2001 CHARGES. SPECIAL TERMINATION PENSION AND MEDICAL BENEFITS,

AGGREGATING $43 MILLION IN 2002 AND $62 MILLION IN 2001, WERE OFFERED TO

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. THESE BENEFITS WILL GENERALLY BE PAID OVER THEIR LIFE

EXPECTANCIES.  IN ADDITION, OF THE $62 MILLION IN SEPARATION PAY THAT WAS

DEFERRED IN 2001, $47 MILLION WAS RECLASSIFIED TO CURRENT IN 2002. THE COMPANY

ALSO RECORDED $3 MILLION OF NON-CASH STOCK OPTION EXPENSE ($8 MILLION IN 2001)

DUE TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES AGE 50 AND OLDER TO RETIREE

STATUS, RESULTING IN A MODIFICATION OF THEIR ORIGINAL STOCK OPTION AWARDS FOR

ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. THE CURRENT LIABILITIES AND A PORTION OF THE NON-CURRENT

LIABILITIES WILL BE FUNDED THROUGH CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATIONS, WHILE FUNDING

FOR CERTAIN LONG-TERM SPECIAL TERMINATION PENSION AND MEDICAL LIABILITIES WILL

BE PROVIDED THROUGH ESTABLISHED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT TRUST FUNDS.  THE

MAJORITY OF THE LONG-TERM PORTION OF THE LIABILITY, PRIMARILY SPECIAL

TERMINATION PENSION AND MEDICAL LIABILITIES, IS REFLECTED AS A COMPONENT OF

3M'S PENSION AND MEDICAL TRUST PLANS AS A PORTION OF THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT

OBLIGATION (ABO).  IT IS ESTIMATED THAT 3M'S BENEFIT PLANS REFLECT

APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION OF RESTRUCTURING RELATED LONG-TERM LIABILITIES THAT

HAVE NOT YET BEEN PAID OUT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002.

THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN INCLUDES ACTIONS IN 25 LOCATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES,

27 IN EUROPE, EIGHT IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA, 13 IN LATIN AMERICA, AND FOUR IN

CANADA. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL ACTIONS REQUIRED BY THE PLAN WERE COMPLETED BY JUNE

30, 2002.  THE COMPANY HAS NOT DISCONTINUED ANY MAJOR PRODUCT LINES AS A RESULT

OF THE RESTRUCTURING PLAN. THE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES DO NOT INCLUDE ANY WRITE-

DOWN OF GOODWILL OR OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

THE MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT IS CALCULATED ON AN ANNUAL BASIS. IF

THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION (ABO) EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF PENSION

ASSETS, THE EMPLOYER MUST RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY THAT IS AT LEAST EQUAL TO THE

UNFUNDED ABO.  IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002, 3M RECORDED A MINIMUM PENSION

LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF $1.056 BILLION (NET

INCOME TAX EFFECTS FOR CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT BECAUSE NO

TAX PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INTO U.S. DOLLARS. RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE TO AVOID

DOUBLE COUNTING IN COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS THAT ARE ALSO DISPLAYED AS PART

OF NET INCOME.  A SUMMARY OF THESE RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS FOLLOWS.

APPROXIMATELY $245 MILLION.  IN 2002, 3M PURCHASED THE 43 PERCENT MINORITY

OWNERSHIP IN 3M INTER-UNITEK GMBH FOR APPROXIMATELY $304 MILLION.  THE

DIFFERENCE IN THESE VALUES RELATES TO EXCHANGE RATE CHANGES AND THE STRONG

PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS.  REFER TO NOTE 3 IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT THESE TRANSACTIONS.

3)  DIVIDENDS DECLARED, BUT NOT PAID AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, OF $40 MILLION WERE

THE ESOP DEBT IS SERVICED BY DIVIDENDS ON STOCK HELD BY THE ESOP AND BY COMPANY

CONTRIBUTIONS. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT REPORTED AS INTEREST EXPENSE, BUT

ARE REPORTED AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME.  OTHER BORROWINGS INCLUDES DEBT HELD BY 3M'S INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES

AND FLOATING RATE NOTES IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH THE LONG-TERM PORTION OF

THIS DEBT PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF U.S. DOLLAR FLOATING RATE DEBT.  OTHER

BORROWINGS IN 2001 ALSO INCLUDES CERTAIN DEBT THAT BECOMES DUE IN 2003.  AS A

RESULT, OTHER BORROWINGS IN LONG-TERM DEBT DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY IN 2002,

WITH THE CORRESPONDING INCREASE REFLECTED IN THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM

DEBT.

60

MATURITIES OF LONG-TERM DEBT FOR THE NEXT FIVE YEARS ARE: 2003, $353 MILLION;

2004, $385 MILLION; 2005, $437 MILLION; 2006, $39 MILLION; AND 2007, $40

MILLION.

AT YEAR-END 2002, AVAILABLE SHORT-TERM LINES OF CREDIT TOTALED ABOUT $656

MILLION, OF WHICH $64 MILLION WAS OUTSTANDING.  THE COMPANY ALSO HAS

UNCOMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT TOTALING $250 MILLION.  DEBT COVENANTS DO NOT

RESTRICT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

ON NOVEMBER 15, 2002, 3M SOLD $639 MILLION IN AGGREGATE FACE AMOUNT OF 30-YEAR

ZERO COUPON SENIOR NOTES (THE "CONVERTIBLE NOTES") THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO

SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK. THE GROSS PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING, TO BE USED

FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, WERE $550 MILLION ($540 MILLION NET OF

ISSUANCE COSTS). THE TERMS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES INCLUDE A YIELD TO

MATURITY OF .50 PERCENT AND AN INITIAL CONVERSION PREMIUM OF 40 PERCENT OVER

THE $130.00 CLOSING PRICE OF 3M COMMON STOCK ON NOVEMBER 14, 2002. IF CERTAIN

CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION (RELATING TO THE CLOSING COMMON STOCK PRICES OF 3M

EXCEEDING CERTAIN THRESHOLDS FOR SPECIFIED PERIODS) ARE MET, HOLDERS MAY

CONVERT EACH OF THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES INTO 4.7301 SHARES OF 3M

COMMON STOCK IN ANY CALENDAR QUARTER COMMENCING AFTER MARCH 31, 2003.  IF THE

CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, AND 3M ELECTS NOT TO SETTLE IN CASH, THE

30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE IN THE AGGREGATE INTO

APPROXIMATELY 3.0 MILLION SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK. 3M MAY REDEEM THE 30-YEAR

ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES AT ANY TIME IN WHOLE OR IN PART, AFTER FIVE YEARS AT

THE GREATER OF THE ACCRETED CONVERSION PRICE OR THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE.

HOLDERS OF THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES HAVE THE OPTION TO REQUIRE 3M

TO PURCHASE THEIR NOTES AT ACCRETED VALUE IN YEARS THREE, FIVE, 10, 15, 20 AND

25.   3M MAY CHOOSE TO PAY THE REDEMPTION PURCHASE PRICE IN CASH AND/OR COMMON

STOCK.  DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A

THREE-YEAR PERIOD BEGINNING IN NOVEMBER 2002.  THERE WAS NO IMPACT ON 3M'S

2002 DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE, AS THE CONVERSION RIGHTS COMMENCE AFTER MARCH

31, 2003.  ON FEBRUARY 14, 2003, 3M REGISTERED THESE CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN A

REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

IN DECEMBER 2000, THE COMPANY ISSUED APPROXIMATELY $350 MILLION OF DEBT

SECURITIES, WHICH IS CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM DEBT. THE REMARKETABLE

SECURITIES CAN BE REMARKETED ANNUALLY, AT THE OPTION OF THE DEALER, FOR A YEAR

EACH TIME, WITH A FINAL MATURITY DATE OF DECEMBER 2010.  IN DECEMBER 2002, THE

COMPANY'S DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE REMARKETED FOR ONE YEAR.  THEY

WERE REISSUED WITH A FIXED COUPON RATE OF 5.6736 PERCENT.

IN OCTOBER 2000, THE COMPANY FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION WITH THE SECURITIES

AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RELATING TO THE POTENTIAL OFFERING OF DEBT SECURITIES

OF UP TO $1.5 BILLION.  AFTER THE SHELF REGISTRATION BECAME EFFECTIVE, THE

COMPANY, IN MAY 2001, ESTABLISHED UNDER THE SHELF A MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM

THROUGH WHICH UP TO $1.4 BILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MAY BE OFFERED.  3M

PLANS TO USE THE NET PROCEEDS FROM FUTURE ISSUANCES OF DEBT SECURITIES UNDER

THESE REGISTRATIONS FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, INCLUDING THE REPAYMENT OF

DEBT OR THE FINANCING OF POSSIBLE ACQUISITIONS.  AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, $950

MILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES HAD BEEN ISSUED UNDER THE MEDIUM-TERM NOTE

PROGRAM AND ANOTHER $56 MILLION OF DEBT SECURITIES HAD BEEN ISSUED DIRECTLY

FROM THE SHELF, AGGREGATING $1.006 BILLION OF OUTSTANDING DEBT SECURITIES

ISSUED UNDER THE SHELF.

NOTE 10. DERIVATIVES AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS, AND FORWARD AND OPTION

CONTRACTS TO MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE,

INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY MARKET VOLATILITY.  THE INFORMATION THAT FOLLOWS

EXPLAINS THE VARIOUS TYPES OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, FOLLOWED

BY A TABLE THAT RECAPS 2002 AND 2001 NET INVESTMENT HEDGING AND CASH FLOW

HEDGING AMOUNTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS:  THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAPS TO HEDGE AGAINST

THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS DENOMINATED IN

FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS.

THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD VARIOUS OPEN FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD

61

AND OPTION CONTRACTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAD MATURITIES OF ONE YEAR

OR LESS.  THE AMOUNTS AT RISK ARE NOT MATERIAL BECAUSE THE COMPANY HAS

THE ABILITY TO GENERATE OFFSETTING FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS.  THE SETTLEMENT

OR EXTENSION OF THESE DERIVATIVES WILL RESULT IN RECLASSIFICATIONS TO EARNINGS

IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS (FROM OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME). THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH 3M IS HEDGING ITS

EXPOSURE TO THE VARIABILITY IN FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR A MAJORITY OF THE

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, EXCLUDING THOSE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS RELATED TO THE

PAYMENT OF VARIABLE INTEREST ON EXISTING FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, IS 12 MONTHS.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY CONVERTED A FOREIGN CURRENCY

BASED PRICING CONTRACT INTO A DOLLAR-BASED PRICING CONTRACT. THIS RESULTED IN

THE DISCONTINUANCE OF CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOW HEDGES. THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZED A $10 MILLION PRE-TAX LOSS (RECORDED IN COST OF SALES) RELATED TO

THE DISCONTINUANCE OF THESE CONTRACTS.  HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL

FOR THE YEAR 2002 OR 2001.

INTEREST RATE & CURRENCY SWAPS:  THE COMPANY MANAGES INTEREST EXPENSE USING A

MIX OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATE DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE BORROWING COSTS, THE

COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE

COMPANY AGREES TO EXCHANGE, AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

FIXED AND FLOATING INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AN AGREED-UPON

NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE AND CURRENCY SWAPS TO

MANAGE INTEREST RATE RISK RELATED TO BORROWINGS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 THE COMPANY HAS INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH A FAIR VALUE OF

$37 MILLION ($7 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001) DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES

OF UNDERLYING FIXED RATE OBLIGATIONS.  THE MARK-TO-MARKET OF THESE FAIR VALUE

HEDGES IS RECORDED AS GAINS OR LOSSES IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND IS OFFSET BY THE

GAIN OR LOSS ON THE UNDERLYING DEBT INSTRUMENT THAT IS ALSO RECORDED IN

INTEREST EXPENSE.  ALL EXISTING FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE 100 PERCENT EFFECTIVE AND

THUS, THERE IS NO IMPACT TO EARNINGS DUE TO HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS.

AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, THE COMPANY ALSO USES CROSS-CURRENCY INTEREST RATE

SWAPS TO HEDGE FOREIGN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES.  THERE WERE NO CROSS-

CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGING:  AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN

CURRENCY DEBT AND FORWARDS TO HEDGE PORTIONS OF THE COMPANY'S NET INVESTMENTS

IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS.  FOR HEDGES THAT MEET THE EFFECTIVENESS REQUIREMENTS,

THE NET GAINS OR LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION WITHIN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WITH ANY INEFFECTIVENESS RECORDED IN COST OF SALES.

HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS RESULTED IN AFTER-TAX REALIZED GAINS TOTALING ABOUT $2

MILLION IN 2002 ($4 MILLION IN 2001).

COMMODITY PRICE MANAGEMENT:  THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH

NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION SWAPS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL

CONTRACTS.  THE COMPANY USES COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS TO MANAGE PRICE VOLATILITY.  THE RELATED MARK-TO-MARKET

GAIN OR LOSS ON QUALIFYING HEDGES IS INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO

THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE (TYPICALLY 100 PERCENT EFFECTIVE), AND RECLASSIFIED INTO

COST OF SALES IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS

EARNINGS.  3M HAS HEDGED ITS EXPOSURE TO THE VARIABILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS

FOR CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS THROUGH 2004.  NO SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY

CASH FLOW HEDGES WERE DISCONTINUED DURING THE YEAR 2002 OR 2001.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGING AND CASH FLOW HEDGING:  AMOUNTS RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE

TRANSLATION RELATED TO NET INVESTMENT HEDGING, AND CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENT

DISCLOSURES FOLLOW. RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE TO AVOID DOUBLE

COUNTING IN COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS THAT ARE ALSO INCLUDED AS PART OF NET

INCOME. THE AMOUNT OF THE RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENT RECOGNIZED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS EQUAL TO, BUT OPPOSITE IN SIGN FROM, THE AMOUNT OF THE

REALIZED GAIN OR LOSS IN NET INCOME.

RECLASSIFY TO EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS A MAJORITY OF THE CASH FLOW

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AFTER-TAX LOSS OF $39 MILLION (WITH THE IMPACT LARGELY

OFFSET BY FOREIGN CURRENCY CASH FLOWS FROM UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEMS).

CREDIT RISK:  THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF

NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES IN INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS, AND

OPTION AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY'S RISK IS LIMITED

TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY ACTIVELY MONITORS ITS

EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH THE USE OF CREDIT APPROVALS AND CREDIT LIMITS,

AND BY SELECTING MAJOR INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS

COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY OF THESE

COUNTERPARTIES.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS:  AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, THE

COMPANY'S FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE, INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, BORROWING, AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS.

THE FAIR VALUES OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE, AND SHORT-TERM DEBT (EXCEPT THE $350 MILLION DEALER REMARKETABLE

SECURITY) APPROXIMATED CARRYING VALUES BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM NATURE OF

THESE INSTRUMENTS.  AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE

REPORTED AT FAIR VALUES.  FAIR VALUES FOR INVESTMENTS HELD AT COST ARE NOT

READILY AVAILABLE, BUT ARE BELIEVED TO APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE.  THE CARRYING

NOTE 11.  INCOME TAXES

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, ABOUT $3.9 BILLION OF UNREMITTED EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO

INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES WERE CONSIDERED TO BE INDEFINITELY INVESTED.  NO

PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR TAXES THAT MIGHT BE PAYABLE IF THESE EARNINGS WERE

REMITTED TO THE UNITED STATES.  THE COMPANY'S INTENTION IS TO REINVEST THESE

EARNINGS PERMANENTLY OR TO REPATRIATE THE EARNINGS WHEN IT IS TAX EFFECTIVE TO

DO SO.  IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF INCREMENTAL TAXES THAT

MIGHT ARISE WERE THESE EARNINGS TO BE REMITTED.  HOWEVER, THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THAT THE UNITED STATES FOREIGN TAX CREDITS WOULD LARGELY ELIMINATE ANY UNITED

STATES TAXES AND OFFSET ANY FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES DUE ON REMITTANCE.

ANNUAL TAX PROVISIONS INCLUDE AMOUNTS CONSIDERED SUFFICIENT TO PAY ASSESSMENTS

THAT MAY RESULT FROM EXAMINATION OF PRIOR YEAR TAX RETURNS; HOWEVER, THE AMOUNT

ULTIMATELY PAID UPON RESOLUTION OF ISSUES MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THE AMOUNT

ACCRUED.

AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT COMMITMENTS AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MADE BY

3M, INCOME FROM MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES IS SUBJECT TO

REDUCED TAX RATES OR, IN SOME CASES, IS EXEMPT FROM TAX FOR YEARS THROUGH 2012.

THE INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE TAX STATUS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES

ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $27 MILLION (7 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2002, $18

MILLION (5 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2001 AND $24 MILLION (6 CENTS PER

DILUTED SHARE) IN 2000.

IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002, THE COMPANY MADE A $789 MILLION TAX DEDUCTIBLE

CONTRIBUTION TO ITS UNITED STATES PENSION PLAN.  THE CURRENT INCOME TAX

PROVISION INCLUDES A BENEFIT FOR THE PENSION CONTRIBUTION;  THE DEFERRED

PROVISION INCLUDES A COST FOR THE RELATED TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE.  THE COMPANY

ALSO RECORDED A MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY (NET OF TAX) WITHIN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IN 2002.  THE CHANGE IN THE YEAR-END DEFERRED TAX BALANCE

INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF RECORDING THIS MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY, IN ADDITION TO

THE ANNUAL PROVISION FOR DEFERRED INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

IN 2000, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE,

REDUCING EARNINGS BY $75 MILLION NET OF TAX.  THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES

EXCLUDES A $42 MILLION TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO THIS CUMULATIVE EFFECT.

3M'S BUSINESSES ARE ORGANIZED, MANAGED AND INTERNALLY REPORTED AS SIX SEGMENTS

BASED ON DIFFERENCES IN PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES.  THESE SEGMENTS

ARE TRANSPORTATION, GRAPHICS AND SAFETY; HEALTH CARE; INDUSTRIAL; CONSUMER AND

OFFICE; ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS; AND SPECIALTY MATERIAL. THESE SEGMENTS HAVE

WORLDWIDE RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT LINES. 3M

IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE PRODUCT OR MARKET.

TRANSACTIONS AMONG REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE RECORDED AT COST.  3M IS AN

INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE CHARACTERIZED BY SUBSTANTIAL INTERSEGMENT COOPERATION,

COST ALLOCATIONS AND INVENTORY TRANSFERS.  THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT

REPRESENT THAT THESE SEGMENTS, IF OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY, WOULD REPORT THE

OPERATING INCOME AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION SHOWN. THE ALLOCATIONS

RESULTING FROM THE SHARED UTILIZATION OF ASSETS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE

OF THE UNDERLYING ACTIVITY FOR SEGMENT ASSETS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION,

AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED EITF NO. 00-25 EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002.  THIS ADOPTION

RESULTED IN A RECLASSIFICATION OF APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION OF ADVERTISING

EXPENSES FROM SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES TO NET SALES FOR

2000 AND 2001, WITH NO IMPACT ON OPERATING INCOME.  THESE ADJUSTMENTS WERE

REFLECTED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENT.

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY ALSO RECLASSIFIED NET SALES AND OPERATING

INCOME FOR THE REALIGNMENT OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES FROM THE HEALTH CARE SEGMENT

TO THE CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENT.  THESE BUSINESSES HAD NET SALES OF $118

MILLION AND OPERATING INCOME OF $7 MILLION FOR TOTAL YEAR 2001.  THIS

REALIGNMENT HAD NO IMPACT ON TOTAL COMPANY NET SALES OR OPERATING INCOME.

NOTE 14.  PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

3M HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

U.S. EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENSION BENEFITS

ARE BASED PRINCIPALLY ON AN EMPLOYEE'S YEARS OF SERVICE AND COMPENSATION NEAR

RETIREMENT.  IN ADDITION TO PROVIDING PENSION BENEFITS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES

CERTAIN POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS U.S. EMPLOYEES WHO REACH RETIREMENT AGE WHILE

EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY.  MOST INTERNATIONAL EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES ARE

COVERED BY GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS.  THE COST OF COMPANY-PROVIDED

HEALTH CARE PLANS FOR THESE INTERNATIONAL EMPLOYEES IS NOT MATERIAL.

THE COMPANY'S PENSION FUNDING POLICY IS TO DEPOSIT WITH INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES

AMOUNTS AT LEAST EQUAL TO ACCRUED LIABILITIES, TO THE EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW.

TRUST FUNDS AND DEPOSITS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE MAINTAINED TO PROVIDE

PENSION BENEFITS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR BENEFICIARIES.  IN ADDITION,

THE COMPANY HAS SET ASIDE FUNDS FOR ITS U.S. POSTRETIREMENT PLAN WITH AN

INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE AND MAKES PERIODIC CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE PLAN.

DURING 2001, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MEASUREMENT DATE OF ITS U.S. EMPLOYEE

BENEFIT PLANS (QUALIFIED AND NONQUALIFIED PENSION BENEFIT PLANS AND ITS U.S.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN) FROM DECEMBER 31 TO SEPTEMBER 30.  INFORMATION

PRESENTED IN THE TABLES FOR 2001 REFLECTS A MEASUREMENT DATE OF SEPTEMBER 30,

2001, AND DECEMBER 31 FOR PRIOR PERIODS.  THIS CHANGE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE DETERMINATION OF PERIODIC PENSION COST OR PENSION OBLIGATIONS.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THIS CHANGE IS PREFERABLE TO THE METHOD PREVIOUSLY

EMPLOYED, AS IT FACILITATES THE BENEFIT COST PLANNING AND FORECASTING PROCESS.

68

IN THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANY HAS A QUALIFIED AND NON-QUALIFIED PENSION

PLAN.  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002 (MEASUREMENT DATE), THE COMPANY'S U.S. QUALIFIED

PENSION PLAN ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION EXCEEDED THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN

ASSETS.  THE U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION WAS

$6.5 BILLION AND PLAN ASSETS TOTALED $5.9 BILLION.  AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2002, AND

SEPTEMBER 30, 2001, THE COMPANY'S U.S. NON-QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN HAD AN

UNFUNDED ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF $224 MILLION AND $196 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.  THERE ARE NO PLAN ASSETS IN THE NON-QUALIFIED PLAN DUE TO ITS

NATURE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS IN THE AGGREGATE HAD AN

ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF $2.4 BILLION AND PLAN ASSETS TOTALED $2.1

BILLION. CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS WERE UNDERFUNDED AS OF YEAR-END

2002 AND 2001. THE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF THESE PLANS WERE $1.089

BILLION IN 2002 AND $534 MILLION IN 2001.  THE ASSETS OF THESE PLANS WERE $682

MILLION IN 2002 AND $287 MILLION IN 2001.  THE NET UNDERFUNDED AMOUNTS ARE

INCLUDED IN CURRENT AND OTHER LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

NOTE 15.  EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

THE COMPANY SPONSORS EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS UNDER SECTION 401(K) OF THE

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.  THESE PLANS ARE OFFERED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL REGULAR

U.S. EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS OF UP TO 6 PERCENT OF COMPENSATION ARE

MATCHED AT RATES RANGING FROM 25 TO 50 PERCENT, WITH ADDITIONAL COMPANY

CONTRIBUTIONS DEPENDING UPON COMPANY PERFORMANCE.  ONLY THE COMPANY MATCH IS

INVESTED IN 3M STOCK, WITH EMPLOYEE FUNDS INVESTED IN A NUMBER OF INVESTMENT

OPTIONS.  VESTED EMPLOYEES MAY SELL UP TO 50 PERCENT OF THEIR 3M SHARES AND

DIVERSIFY INTO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP).  THIS PLAN WAS

ESTABLISHED IN 1989 AS A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OF FUNDING THE MAJORITY OF THE

COMPANY'S CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER 401(K) EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS.  TOTAL ESOP SHARES

ARE CONSIDERED TO BE SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS.

DIVIDENDS ON SHARES HELD BY THE ESOP ARE PAID TO THE ESOP TRUST AND, TOGETHER

WITH COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS, ARE USED BY THE ESOP TO REPAY PRINCIPAL AND

INTEREST ON THE OUTSTANDING NOTES.  THE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO DIVIDENDS PAID

ON UNALLOCATED SHARES WAS CHARGED DIRECTLY TO EQUITY AND TOTALED APPROXIMATELY

$6 MILLION PER YEAR FOR 2002, 2001 AND 2000.  OVER THE LIFE OF THE NOTES,

SHARES ARE RELEASED FOR ALLOCATION TO PARTICIPANTS BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE

CURRENT YEAR'S DEBT SERVICE TO THE REMAINING DEBT SERVICE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT

PAYMENT.

70

THE ESOP HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE COMPANY'S EMPLOYEE

SAVINGS PLANS. AS PERMITTED BY AICPA STATEMENT OF POSITION 93-6, "EMPLOYERS'

ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS", THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO

CONTINUE ITS PRACTICES, WHICH ARE BASED ON STATEMENT OF POSITION 76-3,

"ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS" AND

SUBSEQUENT CONSENSUS OF THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE OF THE FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD.  ACCORDINGLY, THE DEBT OF THE ESOP IS RECORDED AS

DEBT, AND SHARES PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL ARE REPORTED AS UNEARNED COMPENSATION

IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN

STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.  UNEARNED COMPENSATION IS

REDUCED SYMMETRICALLY AS THE ESOP MAKES PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON THE DEBT.

EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ESOP INCLUDE TOTAL DEBT SERVICE ON THE NOTES, LESS

DIVIDENDS.  THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES TREASURY SHARES, ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR

VALUE, TO EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS TO COVER OBLIGATIONS NOT FUNDED BY THE ESOP.

THESE AMOUNTS ARE REPORTED AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE.
