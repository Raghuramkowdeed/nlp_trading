STEADY STREAM OF INVENTIONS THAT ARE COVERED BY NEW PATENTS. PATENTS APPLICABLE

COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION IS OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED

BY A PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY FROM COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF

PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN THE

COUNTRY.

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT

ITS PATENTS PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE IN MANY OF ITS

BUSINESSES. IN GENERAL, NO SINGLE PATENT OR GROUP OF RELATED PATENTS IS IN

ITSELF ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE OR TO ANY OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS

SEGMENTS.

RAW MATERIALS

IN 2008, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED COST INCREASES

AFFECTING METALS, WOOD PULP AND OIL-DERIVED RAW MATERIALS. TO DATE, THE COMPANY

IS RECEIVING SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF ALL RAW MATERIALS TO MEET ITS REASONABLY

FORESEEABLE PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT FUTURE

SHORTAGES OF RAW MATERIALS OR THE IMPACT ANY SUCH SHORTAGES WOULD HAVE. 3M HAS

AVOIDED DISRUPTION TO ITS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS THROUGH CAREFUL MANAGEMENT

OF EXISTING RAW MATERIAL INVENTORIES AND DEVELOPMENT AND QUALIFICATION OF

ADDITIONAL SUPPLY SOURCES. 3M MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED

SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

3MS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY

NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AROUND THE WORLD. 3M HAS MADE, AND

PLANS TO CONTINUE MAKING, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE

LAWS. 3M IS ALSO INVOLVED IN REMEDIATION ACTIONS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS

FROM PAST OPERATIONS AT CERTAIN SITES (REFER TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER

LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES IN NOTE 14, COMMITMENTS AND

CONTINGENCIES).

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXISTING

CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR

FUTURE REVENUES ARE EXPENSED. RESERVES FOR LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED

REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE

AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY

STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION. ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE

OPERATIONS GENERALLY ARE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES.

IN 2008, 3M EXPENDED ABOUT $26 MILLION FOR CAPITAL

PROJECTS RELATED TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS AMOUNT EXCLUDES

EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIONS RELATING TO EXISTING MATTERS CAUSED BY

PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE REVENUES, WHICH ARE

EXPENSED. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES HAVE INCLUDED

POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICES  SUCH AS WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT IMPROVEMENTS,

SCRUBBERS, CONTAINMENT STRUCTURES, SOLVENT RECOVERY UNITS AND THERMAL OXIDIZERS

 AT NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES CONSTRUCTED OR UPGRADED IN THE NORMAL COURSE

OF BUSINESS. CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS POLICIES STRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (OTHER THAN FOR REMEDIATION PROJECTS) FOR

KNOWN PROJECTS ARE PRESENTLY EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $20 MILLION OVER THE

NEXT TWO YEARS FOR NEW OR EXPANDED PROGRAMS TO BUILD FACILITIES OR MODIFY

MANUFACTURING PROCESSES TO MINIMIZE WASTE AND REDUCE EMISSIONS.

WHILE THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE

FUTURE COSTS OF SUCH CLEANUP ACTIVITIES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING

COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

RESULTS OR THOSE REFLECTED IN ANY SUCH FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. PROVIDED

BELOW IS A CAUTIONARY DISCUSSION OF WHAT WE BELIEVE TO BE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

RISK FACTORS APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY. DISCUSSION OF THESE FACTORS IS

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO AND CONSIDERED AN INTEGRAL PART OF PART II, ITEM

7, MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITIONS AND RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

* RESULTS

ARE IMPACTED BY THE EFFECTS OF, AND CHANGES IN, WORLDWIDE ECONOMIC AND CAPITAL

MARKETS CONDITIONS.

THE COMPANY OPERATES IN MORE THAN 60 COUNTRIES AND DERIVES APPROXIMATELY 64

PERCENT OF ITS REVENUES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANYS BUSINESS

MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY FACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES

THAT ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL, SUCH AS DISRUPTIONS IN FINANCIAL MARKETS OR

DOWNTURNS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY IN SPECIFIC COUNTRIES OR REGIONS, OR IN THE

VARIOUS INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES; SOCIAL, POLITICAL OR LABOR

CONDITIONS IN SPECIFIC COUNTRIES OR REGIONS; OR ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE

AVAILABILITY AND COST OF CAPITAL, INTEREST RATES, TAX RATES, OR REGULATIONS IN

THE JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES.

* THE

COMPANYS CREDIT RATINGS ARE IMPORTANT TO 3MS COST OF CAPITAL.

THE MAJOR RATING AGENCIES ROUTINELY EVALUATE THE COMPANYS CREDIT

PROFILE AND HAVE ASSIGNED DEBT RATINGS TO 3M THAT ARE NEAR THE TOP OF THE

RATINGS SPECTRUM. THIS EVALUATION IS BASED ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS, WHICH

INCLUDE FINANCIAL STRENGTH, BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL RISK, AS WELL AS

TRANSPARENCY WITH RATING AGENCIES AND TIMELINESS OF FINANCIAL REPORTING. THE

COMPANY HAS AN AA CREDIT RATING, WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK, FROM STANDARD &

POORS AND AN AA1 CREDIT RATING, WITH A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK, FROM MOODYS

INVESTORS SERVICE.  THE COMPANYS STRONG

RATINGS SERVE TO LOWER 3MS BORROWING COSTS AND FACILITATE ACCESS TO A VARIETY

OF LENDERS. FAILURE TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT RATINGS LEVEL COULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT THE COMPANYS COST OF FUNDS, LIQUIDITY AND ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS.

* THE COMPANYS RESULTS ARE

AFFECTED BY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMER PREFERENCES.

DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, WHICH

IMPACTS REVENUE AND PROFIT MARGINS, IS AFFECTED BY (I) THE DEVELOPMENT AND

TIMING OF THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS; (II) THE COMPANYS

RESPONSE TO DOWNWARD PRICING TO STAY COMPETITIVE; (III) CHANGES IN

CUSTOMER ORDER PATTERNS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF INVENTORY MAINTAINED

BY CUSTOMERS AND THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER PURCHASES WHICH MAY BE AFFECTED BY

ANNOUNCED PRICE CHANGES, CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, OR THE

CUSTOMERS ABILITY TO ACHIEVE INCENTIVE GOALS; AND (IV) CHANGES IN

CUSTOMERS PREFERENCES FOR OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE SUCCESS OF PRODUCTS

OFFERED BY OUR COMPETITORS, AND CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DESIGNS FOR THEIR PRODUCTS

THAT CAN AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR SOME OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

* FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THOSE RATES MAY AFFECT THE COMPANYS

ABILITY TO REALIZE PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN ITS SALES AND EARNINGS.

BECAUSE THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS AND APPROXIMATELY 64 PERCENT OF THE

COMPANYS REVENUES ARE DERIVED FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND ITS ABILITY TO REALIZE PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN

SALES AND EARNINGS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS

SIGNIFICANTLY AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES.

* THE

COMPANYS GROWTH OBJECTIVES ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TIMING AND MARKET

ACCEPTANCE OF ITS NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY

RENEW ITS PIPELINE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

THIS ABILITY MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED

BY DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, SUCH AS THE INABILITY TO

IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW PRODUCTS, OBTAIN ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PROTECTION,

OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS. THERE ARE NO GUARANTEES THAT NEW

PRODUCTS WILL PROVE TO BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL.

* THE

COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COSTS AND

AVAILABILITY OF PURCHASED COMPONENTS, COMPOUNDS, RAW MATERIALS AND ENERGY,

INCLUDING OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES, DUE TO SHORTAGES,

INCREASED DEMAND, SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS, NATURAL

DISASTERS AND OTHER FACTORS.

THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON VARIOUS COMPONENTS, COMPOUNDS,

RAW MATERIALS, AND ENERGY (INCLUDING OIL AND NATURAL GAS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES)

SUPPLIED BY OTHERS FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF ITS PRODUCTS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT

ANY OF ITS SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS COULD BE INTERRUPTED DUE TO NATURAL AND OTHER

DISASTERS AND OTHER EVENTS, OR BE TERMINATED IN THE FUTURE. ANY SUSTAINED

INTERRUPTION IN THE COMPANYS RECEIPT OF ADEQUATE SUPPLIES COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, WHILE THE COMPANY HAS A

PROCESS TO MINIMIZE VOLATILITY IN COMPONENT AND MATERIAL PRICING, NO ASSURANCE

CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE PRICE

FLUCTUATIONS OR THAT FUTURE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS OR SHORTAGES WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

* ACQUISITIONS,

STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER UNUSUAL EVENTS RESULTING FROM

PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT ACTIONS AND OTHER EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, AND

POSSIBLE ORGANIZATIONAL RESTRUCTURING COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS.

THE COMPANY MONITORS ITS BUSINESS

PORTFOLIO AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND HAS MADE AND MAY CONTINUE TO MAKE

ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, DIVESTITURES AND CHANGES TO ITS

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE. WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE

AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO INTEGRATE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES QUICKLY AND

OBTAIN THE ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES.

* THE

COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED IF THE COMPANY GENERATES FEWER

PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS THAN ESTIMATED.

THE COMPANY UTILIZES VARIOUS TOOLS, SUCH AS LEAN SIX

SIGMA, TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT ALL OF THE PROJECTED PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE REALIZED.

* THE

COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS MAY BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS,

INCLUDING THOSE INVOLVING PRODUCT LIABILITY, ANTITRUST, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHER

MATTERS.

THE

OUTCOME OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY DIFFER FROM THE COMPANYS EXPECTATIONS

BECAUSE THE OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION, INCLUDING REGULATORY MATTERS, ARE OFTEN

DIFFICULT TO RELIABLY PREDICT. VARIOUS FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN LEAD THE

COMPANY TO CHANGE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES AND RELATED INSURANCE

RECEIVABLES WHERE APPLICABLE, OR MAKE SUCH ESTIMATES FOR MATTERS PREVIOUSLY NOT

SUSCEPTIBLE OF REASONABLE

OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD. FOR A MORE DETAILED

OVERVIEW

3M IS A DIVERSIFIED

GLOBAL MANUFACTURER, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATOR AND MARKETER OF A WIDE VARIETY OF

PRODUCTS. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, 3M MADE CERTAIN PRODUCT MOVES BETWEEN

ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION PRESENTED HEREIN REFLECTS THE

IMPACT OF THESE CHANGES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. 3M MANAGES ITS OPERATIONS IN

SIX OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS: INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION; HEALTH CARE;

SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; CONSUMER AND OFFICE; DISPLAY AND

GRAPHICS; AND ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS.

3M HAD RECORD

SALES IN 2008 DESPITE A DRAMATIC FOURTH-QUARTER 2008 ECONOMIC DOWNTURN. 3M IS

RESPONDING TO THIS LOWER DEMAND WITH AGGRESSIVE COST AND CASH MANAGEMENT, ALONG

WITH TIGHTER OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE. 3M EXPECTS TO MANAGE THROUGH THESE

WORLDWIDE MARKET CHALLENGES AND IS POSITIONING ITSELF TO BENEFIT WHEN GROWTH

RETURNS. 3M STREAMLINED ITS OPERATIONS THROUGH 2008 AND WILL CONTINUE TO

OPTIMIZE TO PROTECT AGAINST THE DOWNSIDE THROUGHOUT 2009. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2008 ALONE, 3M ANNOUNCED REDUCTIONS OF OVER 2,400 FULL-TIME POSITIONS

WORLDWIDE, WHICH BROUGHT TOTAL YEAR REDUCTIONS TO APPROXIMATELY 3,500. THESE

JOB ELIMINATIONS SPANNED ALL SECTORS AND ALL GEOGRAPHIES, BUT WERE PARTICULARLY

FOCUSED ON THOSE DEVELOPED ECONOMIES EXPERIENCING THE MOST SALES PRESSURE. IN

ADDITION, 3M HAS FURLOUGHED FACTORY WORKERS UNTIL PRODUCTION VOLUMES RETURN TO

MORE NORMAL LEVELS AND CONTRACT WORKERS ARE ALSO BEING REDUCED TO ONLY THOSE

CONSIDERED ESSENTIAL. THESE 2008 ACTIONS IN TOTAL ARE EXPECTED TO SAVE THE

COMPANY $250 TO $300 MILLION IN 2009. 3M ALSO DECIDED TO DEFER MERIT PAY

INCREASES IN 2009 EXCEPT IN THOSE CASES WHERE LOCAL LAWS PROHIBIT IT, WITH

ESTIMATED COST-AVOIDANCE OF APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION IN 2009. IN ADDITION, 3M

HAS AMENDED ITS PRACTICE ON BANKED VACATION  EFFECTIVELY PHASING IT OUT 

WHICH WILL REDUCE EXPENSES BY AN ESTIMATED $100 MILLION IN BOTH 2009 AND 2010.

WHILE

THIS MARKET IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, IN 2009 FOR PLANNING PURPOSES, 3M IS

ASSUMING YEAR-ON-YEAR DECLINES IN ORGANIC SALES VOLUME, NEGATIVE FOREIGN

CURRENCY IMPACTS ON SALES, OPERATING MARGIN DECLINES, AND EARNINGS PER SHARE

DECLINES.

3M WILL

WORK TO CONSERVE CASH BY REDUCING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES BY MORE THAN 30 PERCENT

IN 2009 AND BY FOCUSING ON REDUCING WORKING CAPITAL. 3M HAS HALTED STOCK

REPURCHASES UNTIL THE CREDIT MARKET OFFERS MORE VISIBILITY. T

HE STRENGTH OF

3MS CUSTOMER FOCUSED DIVERSIFIED BUSINESS AND TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS, UNPARALLED

GEOGRAPHIC REACH, AND RELENTLESS ATTENTION TO OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE, ALONG

WITH 3MS BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH, PROVIDE A STRONG FOUNDATION FOR STABILITY AND

CONSISTENCY IN AN UNCERTAIN GLOBAL ECONOMY.

FOR THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008, SALES DECREASED 11.2

PERCENT COMPARED TO THE SAME PERIOD LAST YEAR, DUE TO AN INCREASINGLY

CHALLENGING GLOBAL ECONOMY. LOCAL CURRENCY SALES (WHICH INCLUDE VOLUME, SELLING

PRICE AND ACQUISITION IMPACTS, BUT EXCLUDE DIVESTITURE AND TRANSLATION IMPACTS)

INCREASED IN SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES AND IN HEALTH CARE. SALES

IN LOCAL CURRENCIES FOR THE OTHER FOUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS DROPPED DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER. FOURTH QUARTER 2008 NET INCOME WAS $536 MILLION, OR $0.77 PER

DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED TO $851 MILLION, OR $1.17 PER DILUTED SHARE IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007. IN RESPONSE TO DIFFICULT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, IN THE

FOURTH-QUARTER OF 2008, 3M TOOK ACTIONS WHICH RESULTED IN NET PRE-TAX CHARGES

OF $219 MILLION FOR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES, WHICH REDUCED

NET INCOME BY $140 MILLION, OR $0.20 PER DILUTED SHARE, AS 3M AGGRESSIVELY

BALANCED ITS COST STRUCTURE TO A SLOWER GROWTH ENVIRONMENT. THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2007 INCLUDED NET PRE-TAX CHARGES OF $20 MILLION RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING,

EXIT ACTIVITIES AND A LOSS ON SALE OF BUSINESSES, WHICH REDUCED NET INCOME BY $12

MILLION, OR $0.02 PER DILUTED SHARE. REFER TO THE SPECIAL ITEMS SUMMARY AT

THE END OF THIS OVERVIEW SECTION FOR MORE DETAIL ON THESE ITEMS THAT IMPACTED

RESULTS.

FOR TOTAL YEAR 2008,

SALES INCREASED 3.3 PERCENT TO $25.3 BILLION, WITH LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES UP 1.4

PERCENT. OPERATING INCOME MARGINS WERE 20.6 PERCENT, INCLUDING RESTRUCTURING

AND OTHER ITEMS THAT NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING INCOME BY $269 MILLION, OR

1.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS. IN ADDITION TO THE FOURTH QUARTER ITEMS NOTED IN THE

PRECEDING PARAGRAPH, REFER TO THE SPECIAL ITEMS SUMMARY AT THE END OF THIS

OVERVIEW SECTION FOR DISCUSSION OF OTHER ITEMS IMPACTING

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESULTS. IN 2008,

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED NET INCOME BY $194

MILLION, OR $0.28 PER DILUTED SHARE. IN 2007, THE LARGEST SPECIAL ITEM WAS THE

GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES, PRIMARILY THE GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS IN EUROPE, WHICH, COMBINED WITH OTHER ITEMS, BENEFITED 2007 NET INCOME

BY $448 MILLION, OR $0.62 PER DILUTED SHARE. INCLUDING THESE SPECIAL ITEMS, 3M

REPORTED NET INCOME OF $3.460 BILLION, OR $4.89 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR 2008,

COMPARED TO NET INCOME OF $4.096 BILLION, OR $5.60 PER DILUTED SHARE, FOR 2007.

IN DECEMBER 2006

AND JANUARY 2007, 3M COMPLETED THE SALE OF ITS BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS, RESULTING IN GAINS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006 AND FIRST QUARTER OF

2007. IN ADDITION, 3M RECORDED A GAIN RELATED TO THE SALE OF ITS OPTICOM

PRIORITY CONTROL SYSTEMS AND CANOGA TRAFFIC DETECTION BUSINESSES IN THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2007. IN BOTH 2007 AND 2006, THESE GAINS ON SALE OF BUSINESSES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY RESTRUCTURING AND THE NET IMPACT OF OTHER SPECIAL ITEMS.

REFER TO SPECIAL ITEMS AT THE END OF THIS OVERVIEW SECTION FOR ADDITIONAL

DETAILS. INCLUDING THESE SPECIAL ITEMS, IN 2007, 3M REPORTED NET SALES OF

$24.462 BILLION AND NET INCOME OF $4.096 BILLION, OR $5.60 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED

WITH NET SALES OF $22.923 BILLION AND NET INCOME OF $3.851 BILLION, OR $5.06

PER DILUTED SHARE, IN 2006. EXCLUDING THE SPECIAL ITEMS IN BOTH YEARS, THE

COMPANY STILL ACHIEVED STRONG UNDERLYING OPERATING PERFORMANCE, HELPED BY A 6.7

PERCENT INCREASE IN NET SALES, WHICH INCLUDED THE DIVESTITURE IMPACTS DISCUSSED

ABOVE THAT REDUCED SALES GROWTH BY 3.8 PERCENT.

IN 2008, WORLDWIDE SALES GROWTH WAS BROAD-BASED, WITH FIVE OF SIX

SEGMENTS EXPERIENCING SALES GROWTH FOR THE YEAR. SAFETY, SECURITY AND

PROTECTION SERVICES SALES GROWTH WAS LED BY ACQUISITIONS, PRIMARILY AEARO, ALONG

WITH ORGANIC GROWTH IN PERSONAL PROTECTION SOLUTIONS, PROTECTIVE WINDOW FILMS

AND CLEANING SOLUTIONS FOR COMMERCIAL BUILDINGS, AND RFID SOLUTIONS (TRACK AND

TRACE). GEOGRAPHIC AREA SALES GROWTH IN THIS BUSINESS SEGMENT WAS STRONG IN

EVERY REGION, HELPED BY AEARO, WITH ORGANIC SALES GROWTH LED BY ASIA PACIFIC

AND LATIN AMERICA. HEALTH CARE SALES GROWTH WAS STRONGEST IN ORTHODONTICS,

DENTAL AND MEDICAL, WITH POSITIVE SALES GROWTH IN ALL MAJOR GEOGRAPHIES, LED BY

ASIA PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA. INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION HAD BROAD-BASED

SALES GROWTH ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO AND ALL MAJOR GEOGRAPHIES, WITH STRONG SALES

GROWTH IN INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES AND TAPES, AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET, ABRASIVES,

AND CLOSURE SYSTEMS FOR PERSONAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS. SALES IN CONSUMER AND OFFICE

WERE LED BY THE HOME CARE AND DO-IT-YOURSELF MARKETS, WITH SALES GROWTH

GEOGRAPHICALLY LED BY ASIA PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA. CONSUMER AND OFFICE

EXPERIENCED WEAKNESS IN 2008 AS SLOWDOWNS IN THE U.S. OFFICE MARKETS AND

RESIDENTIAL HOUSING MARKETS PERSIST. ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SALES GROWTH

WAS LED BY ELECTRICAL MARKETS AND ELECTRONIC MARKETS MATERIALS, WITH GEOGRAPHIC

SALES GROWTH STRONGEST IN ASIA PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA. THE ELECTRONICS

SOLUTIONS AND COMMUNICATIONS MARKETS BUSINESSES REMAIN SOFT. 3M ALSO CONTINUED

TO EXPERIENCE DECLINES IN THE FLEXIBLE CIRCUITS BUSINESS, WHERE A NUMBER OF

PRODUCT SOLUTIONS ARE GOING END-OF-LIFE. WITHIN DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS, POSITIVE

SALES GROWTH IN TRAFFIC SAFETY SYSTEMS AND COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS WAS MORE THAN

OFFSET BY LOWER SALES IN OPTICAL SYSTEMS. OPTICAL SYSTEMS SALES WERE DOWN 34

PERCENT WHEN COMPARED TO 2007, RESULTING IN A SALES DECLINE FOR TOTAL DISPLAY

AND GRAPHICS OF 16.6 PERCENT. SELLING PRICE AND ATTACHMENT RATE PRESSURE REMAIN

INTENSE IN SEGMENTS OF THE LCD MARKET AS OEMS AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE COST

REDUCTIONS FROM THEIR COMPONENT SUPPLIERS, INCLUDING 3M. IN ADDITION, DEMAND

DROPPED SIGNIFICANTLY IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER OF 2008 AS NUMEROUS

ORDERS WERE CANCELED FOR LARGE-SIZE LCD PANELS DUE TO WEAK HOLIDAY SEASON

SALES, REFLECTING THE GLOBAL DOWNTURN IN CONSUMER AND CORPORATE DEMAND. REFER

TO THE PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT SECTION FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION

OF THE RESULTS OF THE RESPECTIVE SEGMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WORLDWIDE TOTAL SALES

GROWTH WAS 3.3 PERCENT IN 2008. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH WAS 1.4 PERCENT FOR

2008, INCLUDING A 3.3 PERCENTAGE POINT BENEFIT FROM ACQUISITIONS.

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 18.3 PERCENT IN SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION

SERVICES (INCLUDING 14.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM ACQUISITIONS), 6.8 PERCENT IN

HEALTH CARE (INCLUDING 1.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM ACQUISITIONS) AND 4.6 PERCENT

IN INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION (INCLUDING 3.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM

ACQUISITIONS). LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES DECLINED 0.3 PERCENT IN CONSUMER AND

OFFICE, 1.7 PERCENT IN ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS AND 17.9 PERCENT IN DISPLAY

AND GRAPHICS.

IN 2007, WORLDWIDE TOTAL

SALES INCREASED 6.7 PERCENT. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH WAS 7.3 PERCENT, WITH

ORGANIC LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH OF 4.9 PERCENT (INCLUDING 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINT

BENEFIT FROM PHARMACEUTICALS SUPPLY AGREEMENTS) AND ACQUISITIONS ADDING 2.4

PERCENT. DIVESTITURES, PRIMARILY THE SALE OF THE GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS (HEALTH CARE SEGMENT), DECREASED WORLDWIDE SALES GROWTH BY 3.8

PERCENT. THE SALE OF THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS WAS NOT PRESENTED AS A

DISCONTINUED OPERATION DUE TO THE EXTENT OF THE PROJECTED CONTINUING CASH FLOWS

FROM 3MS CONTRACTUAL SUPPLY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BUYERS IN RELATION TO THOSE

OF THE BUSINESS THAT WAS SOLD.

GEOGRAPHICALLY, LATIN

AMERICA AND CANADA LED LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH IN 2008, WITH A COMBINED

INCREASE OF 12.8 PERCENT, FOLLOWED BY EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA (HEREAFTER

REFERRED TO AS EUROPE) WITH A 2.8 PERCENT INCREASE AND THE UNITED STATES WITH A

2.7 PERCENT INCREASE. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES IN ASIA PACIFIC DECLINED 5.9

PERCENT. ASIA PACIFIC WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY OPTICAL SYSTEMS SALES, WHICH

WERE DOWN 34 PERCENT IN THAT REGION. EXCLUDING OPTICAL SYSTEMS, ASIA PACIFIC

SALES INCREASED NEARLY 6 PERCENT ON A LOCAL-CURRENCY BASIS. OF THE

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH, ACQUISITIONS CONTRIBUTED 3.2 PERCENT TO THE COMBINED

LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA, 3.2 PERCENT TO EUROPE, 5.3 PERCENT TO THE UNITED

STATES, AND 0.8 PERCENT TO ASIA PACIFIC. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

POSITIVELY IMPACTED INTERNATIONAL SALES BY 3.4 PERCENT, AS THE U.S. DOLLAR

WEAKENED IN AGGREGATE AGAINST MANY CURRENCIES IN THESE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION POSITIVELY IMPACTED LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA BY

2.4 PERCENT, EUROPE BY 4.0 PERCENT AND ASIA PACIFIC BY 3.2 PERCENT. IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, FOREIGN CURRENCY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED INTERNATIONAL

SALES BY 7.5 PERCENT. WHILE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT GIVEN THE CURRENT EXCHANGE

RATE VOLATILITY, FOREIGN CURRENCY IS ALSO EXPECTED TO HAVE A SIGNIFICANT

NEGATIVE IMPACT IN 2009.

WORLDWIDE OPERATING

INCOME FOR 2008 DECREASED 15.7 PERCENT YEAR-ON-YEAR, WITH MOST OF THIS IMPACT

DUE TO THE YEAR-ON-YEAR CHANGE IN SPECIAL ITEMS DISCUSSED AT THE END OF THIS

OVERVIEW. IN THE PRECEDING TABLE, HEALTH CARE OPERATING INCOME IN 2007 INCLUDED

SIGNIFICANT GAINS RELATED TO THE SALE OF PORTIONS OF ITS PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS IN 2007, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING THE 2008 VERSUS 2007 YEAR-ON-YEAR

COMPARISONS FOR THIS BUSINESS SEGMENT. WORLDWIDE OPERATING INCOME MARGINS WERE

20.6 PERCENT IN 2008, INCLUDING A 1.1 PERCENT PENALTY FROM SPECIAL ITEMS IN

2008. OPERATING INCOME FOR 2007 INCREASED 8.7 PERCENT YEAR-ON-YEAR, INCLUDING A

NET 2.2 PERCENTAGE POINT BENEFIT FROM THE IMPACT OF ITEMS DISCUSSED IN SPECIAL

ITEMS BELOW. OPERATING INCOME MARGINS WERE APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT IN BOTH

2007 AND 2006, WITH SPECIAL ITEMS POSITIVELY IMPACTING THESE MARGINS IN BOTH

YEARS BY APPROXIMATELY 2.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

3M GENERATED $4.533

BILLION OF OPERATING CASH FLOW IN 2008, AN INCREASE OF $258 MILLION COMPARED TO

2007, WHICH FOLLOWED AN INCREASE OF $436 MILLION WHEN COMPARING 2007 TO 2006.

IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, THE COMPANY UTILIZED APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION OF CASH

EACH YEAR TO PAY DIVIDENDS. IN 2008, REPURCHASES OF 3M COMMON STOCK TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $1.6 BILLION, COMPARED TO $3.2 BILLION IN 2007 AND $2.4 BILLION

IN 2006. IN FEBRUARY 2007, 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A TWO-YEAR

SHARE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $7.0 BILLION FOR THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 12,

2007 TO FEBRUARY 28, 2009. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY

$2.6 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE. IN FEBRUARY 2009, 3MS

BOARD OF DIRECTORS EXTENDED THIS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION UNTIL THE

REMAINING $2.6 BILLION IS FULLY UTILIZED. WITH THE COMPANYS CURRENT EMPHASIS

ON MAINTAINING AMPLE LIQUIDITY AND ENHANCING BALANCE SHEET STRENGTH, SHARE

REPURCHASE ACTIVITY HAS BEEN SUSPENDED. HOWEVER, EXTENSION OF THIS PROGRAM WILL

PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY TO RESUME REPURCHASE ACTIVITY WHEN BUSINESS CONDITIONS

PERMIT. IN FEBRUARY 2009, 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A DIVIDEND

INCREASE OF 2 PERCENT FOR 2009, MARKING THE 51ST CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF DIVIDEND

INCREASES FOR 3M. 3MS DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL CAPITAL DEFINED AS

DEBT PLUS EQUITY) AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 WAS 40 PERCENT, COMPARED TO 30

PERCENT AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. A PORTION OF THE INCREASE IN DEBT WAS THE

RESULT OF A STRATEGY TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN A CASH BUFFER IN THE U.S. IN THE

CURRENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT. 3M HAS AN AA CREDIT RATING FROM STANDARD &

POORS, WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK, AND AN AA1 CREDIT RATING FROM MOODYS INVESTORS

SERVICE, WITH A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK. THE COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO CAPITAL

MARKETS TO MEET CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED GROWTH AND ACQUISITION INVESTMENT FUNDING

NEEDS.

IN 2008, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED COST INCREASES

AFFECTING METALS, WOOD PULP AND OIL-DERIVED RAW MATERIALS. TO DATE THE COMPANY

IS RECEIVING SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF ALL RAW MATERIALS TO MEET ITS REASONABLY

FORESEEABLE PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS. IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT FUTURE

SHORTAGES OF RAW MATERIALS OR THE IMPACT ANY SUCH SHORTAGES WOULD HAVE. 3M HAS

AVOIDED DISRUPTION TO ITS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS THROUGH CAREFUL MANAGEMENT

OF EXISTING RAW MATERIAL INVENTORIES AND DEVELOPMENT AND QUALIFICATION OF

ADDITIONAL SUPPLY SOURCES. 3M MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED

SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN 2009, 3M IS CHANGING ITS ANNUAL STOCK OPTION AND

RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT DATE TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN THE AWARD WITH THE

TIMING OF THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE REVIEW PROCESS. IN 2009 AND FORWARD, UNDER

THE ANNUAL GRANT, 3M WILL GRANT SHARES IN FEBRUARY INSTEAD OF MAY AS IN

PREVIOUS YEARS. ACCOUNTING RULES REQUIRES RECOGNITION OF EXPENSE UNDER A

NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING PERIOD APPROACH, REQUIRING COMPENSATION EXPENSE

RECOGNITION WHEN AN EMPLOYEE IS ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE. 3M EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED

STATES ARE ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE AT AGE 55 AND AFTER HAVING COMPLETED FIVE YEARS

OF SERVICE. APPROXIMATELY 25 PERCENT OF THE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARD

EXPENSE DOLLARS ARE FOR THIS RETIREE-ELIGIBLE POPULATION. THEREFORE, IN 2006,

2007 AND 2008 THE SECOND QUARTER OF EACH YEAR (BECAUSE OF THE MAY GRANT

DATE) REFLECTED HIGHER STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAN THE OTHER

QUARTERS. IN 2009, THE RETIREE-ELIGIBLE IMPACT WILL SHIFT TO THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2009. IN ADDITION, BOTH THE FIRST AND SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 WILL REFLECT

ACCELERATED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE EARLIER FEBRUARY

GRANT DATE. THESE AND OTHER FACTORS RESULT IN A FIRST QUARTER 2009 ESTIMATE OF

$0.08 PER DILUTED SHARE FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE COMPARED TO $0.04

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2009 ESTIMATED

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IS ESTIMATED AT $0.04 PER DILUTED SHARE COMPARED TO

$0.06 IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008. REFER TO NOTE 16 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION

OF THE COMPANYS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS.

DURING 2008 THE FUNDED

STATUS OF THE COMPANYS GLOBAL PENSION PLANS DECLINED FROM 100 PERCENT TO 85

PERCENT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE U.S. PENSION PLANS FUNDED STATUS

WAS 89 PERCENT WITH THE QUALIFIED PLAN AT 92 PERCENT, AND THE INTERNATIONAL

PLANS AT 75 PERCENT. BY UTILIZING AN EFFECTIVE HEDGING STRATEGY FOR BOTH FIXED

INCOME AND EQUITY INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY WAS ABLE TO LIMIT THE DECLINE IN

U.S. PENSION PLANS ASSETS TO A NEGATIVE 13.6% RETURN IN 2008, MUCH BETTER THAN

THE OVERALL MARKET. IN 2009, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE AN AMOUNT IN THE

RANGE OF $600 MILLION TO $850 MILLION TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION

PLANS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED MINIMUM PENSION CONTRIBUTION

OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2009. THE CHANGES IN 3MS DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS FUNDED STATUS, WHICH ARE REQUIRED TO BE

MEASURED AS OF EACH YEAR-END, SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED SEVERAL BALANCE SHEET LINE

AMOUNTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THESE

REQUIRED ANNUAL MEASUREMENTS DECREASED PREPAID PENSION BENEFITS ASSETS BY $1.7

BILLION, INCREASED DEFERRED TAXES WITHIN OTHER ASSETS BY $1.1 BILLION,

INCREASED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS LONG-TERM LIABILITIES BY $1.7

BILLION AND DECREASED STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY (REFLECTED AFTER TAXES) BY $2.3

BILLION. OTHER PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT CHANGES DURING THE YEAR, SUCH AS

CONTRIBUTIONS AND AMORTIZATION, ALSO IMPACTED THESE BALANCE SHEET CAPTIONS.

REFER TO CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITHIN MD&A AND NOTE 11 (PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS) FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING 3MS

PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT PLANS.

SPECIAL

ITEMS.

SPECIAL

IN 2008, NET LOSSES FOR

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ACTIONS DECREASED OPERATING INCOME BY $269 MILLION AND

NET INCOME BY $194 MILLION, OR $0.28 PER DILUTED SHARE. 2008 INCLUDED

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ($229 MILLION PRE-TAX, $147 MILLION AFTER-TAX AND

MINORITY INTEREST), EXIT ACTIVITIES ($58 MILLION PRE-TAX, $43 MILLION

AFTER-TAX) AND LOSSES RELATED TO THE SALE OF BUSINESSES ($23 MILLION PRE-TAX,

$32 MILLION AFTER-TAX), WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GAIN ON SALE OF REAL

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE

2 (ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES) AND NOTE 4 (RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT

ACTIVITIES). CONCERNING THE REAL ESTATE GAIN, 3M RECEIVED PROCEEDS AND RECORDED

A GAIN IN 2008 FOR A SALE-LEASEBACK TRANSACTION RELATIVE TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE

LOCATION IN ITALY. 3M ANTICIPATES LEASING BACK THE FACILITY THROUGH LATE 2009

AT WHICH TIME A NEW LOCATION WILL BE UTILIZED.

IN

2007, GAINS ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND REAL ESTATE, NET OF RESTRUCTURING AND

OTHER ITEMS, INCREASED OPERATING INCOME BY $681 MILLION AND NET INCOME BY $448

MILLION, OR $0.62 PER DILUTED SHARE. 2007 INCLUDED

NET BENEFITS FROM GAINS RELATED TO THE SALE OF

BUSINESSES ($849 MILLION PRE-TAX, $550 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AND A GAIN ON SALE OF

REAL ESTATE ($52 MILLION PRE-TAX, $37 MILLION AFTER-TAX), WHICH WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY INCREASES IN ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES ($134 MILLION PRE-TAX, $83

MILLION AFTER-TAX), RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ($41 MILLION PRE-TAX, $27 MILLION

AFTER-TAX), AND OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES ($45 MILLION PRE-TAX, $29 MILLION

AFTER-TAX). THESE ITEMS, EXCEPT THE GAIN ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE, ARE DISCUSSED

IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 2 (ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES), NOTE 4 (RESTRUCTURING

ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES) AND NOTE 14 (COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES). GAINS

ON SALE OF BUSINESSES INCLUDE THE SECOND-QUARTER 2007 SALE OF 3MS OPTICOM

PRIORITY CONTROL SYSTEMS AND CANOGA TRAFFIC DETECTION BUSINESSES, AND THE

FIRST-QUARTER 2007 SALE OF THE GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IN

EUROPE. CONCERNING THE REAL ESTATE SALE, 3M SOLD A LABORATORY FACILITY LOCATED

IN SUWON, KOREA.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN

2006, GAINS ON SALE OF BUSINESSES, NET OF RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS,

INCREASED OPERATING INCOME BY $523 MILLION AND NET INCOME BY $438 MILLION, OR

$0.57 PER DILUTED SHARE.

2006 INCLUDED NET BENEFITS FROM GAINS RELATED TO THE SALE OF CERTAIN

PORTIONS OF 3MS BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS ($1.074 BILLION PRE-TAX, $674

MILLION AFTER-TAX) AND FAVORABLE INCOME TAX ADJUSTMENTS ($149 MILLION), WHICH

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS ($403 MILLION PRE-TAX,

$257 MILLION AFTER-TAX), ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSES ($95 MILLION PRE-TAX AND AFTER-TAX), SETTLEMENT COSTS OF AN ANTITRUST

CLASS ACTION ($40 MILLION PRE-TAX, $25 MILLION AFTER-TAX), AND ENVIRONMENTAL

OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS ($13 MILLION PRE-TAX, $8

MILLION AFTER-TAX). THESE ITEMS, EXCEPT THE SETTLEMENT COSTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL

OBLIGATIONS, ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 2 (ACQUISITIONS AND

DIVESTITURES), NOTE 4 (RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES) AND NOTE 8

(INCOME TAXES). CONCERNING SETTLEMENT COSTS, THE COMPANY RECORDED $40 MILLION

IN 2006 WITH RESPECT TO A SETTLEMENT IN PRINCIPLE RELATED TO THE ANTITRUST

CLASS ACTION BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF DIRECT PURCHASERS WHO DID NOT PURCHASE

PRIVATE LABEL TAPE. CONCERNING ENVIRONMENTAL OBLIGATIONS, THE COMPANY INCREASED

COST OF SALES.

COST OF SALES INCLUDES MANUFACTURING, ENGINEERING AND FREIGHT COSTS.

COST OF SALES AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES INCREASED 0.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2008

COMPARED TO 2007, WITH THIS INCREASE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN OPTICAL

SYSTEMS SALES AND THE RAPID VOLUME DECLINES OF CERTAIN OTHER BUSINESSES IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER. FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE YEAR 3MS BROAD-BASED PORTFOLIO

PERFORMED AS EXPECTED, WITH BENEFITS FROM SELLING PRICE INCREASES, FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION, AND A CONTINUOUS FOCUS ON DRIVING OPERATIONAL EXCELLENCE,

HELPING TO OFFSET RAW MATERIAL INFLATION OF APPROXIMATELY 4 PERCENT FOR 2008,

COMPARED WITH 2007. IN 2008, RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT COSTS INCREASED COST OF

SALES BY $122 MILLION, OR 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES, SIMILAR

TO THE 0.3 PERCENTAGE POINT IMPACT IN 2007, AS DISCUSSED BELOW.

COST OF SALES AS A

PERCENT OF NET SALES INCREASED 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006,

WITH THIS INCREASE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALE OF THE BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS, WHICH HAD LOWER THAN AVERAGE COST OF SALES. RAW MATERIAL COSTS

INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 1 PERCENT IN 2007, COMPARED WITH 2006. IN 2007,

RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT COSTS INCREASED COST OF SALES BY $64 MILLION, OR 0.3

PERCENTAGE POINTS. THESE CHARGES PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF

CERTAIN FLEXIBLE CIRCUIT MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, THE PHASEOUT OF OPERATIONS

AT THE COMPANYS NEW JERSEY ROOFING GRANULE FACILITY AND CHARGES RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS DECISION TO CLOSE AN ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY IN

WISCONSIN. IN 2006, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS INCREASED COST OF SALES BY

$143 MILLION, OR 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

SELLING, GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES INCREASED 0.3

PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2008 WHEN COMPARED TO 2007, OR 4.6 PERCENT IN DOLLARS. IN

2008, SG&A EXPENSES RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES

WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GAIN ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE, WHICH COMBINED

INCREASED SG&A BY $111 MILLION, OR 0.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS, SIMILAR TO THE

0.4 PERCENTAGE POINT IMPACT IN 2007, AS DISCUSSED BELOW. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2008, AS PART OF ITS RESTRUCTURING PROGRAM, 3M TOOK AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS TO

REDUCE GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND ALSO PARED BACK SELLING AND

MARKETING COSTS IN CERTAIN BUSINESSES.

SG&A EXPENSES

AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES DECREASED 1.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2007 WHEN COMPARED

TO 2006, AS EXPENSES INCURRED IN 2006 IN THE COMPANYS NOW-DIVESTED GLOBAL

BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS DID NOT REPEAT IN 2007. NON-PHARMACEUTICAL

ONGOING SG&A EXPENSES, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, WERE UP

APPROXIMATELY 7 PERCENT IN DOLLARS, AS THE COMPANY INVESTED IN SALES AND

MARKETING TO SUPPORT GROWTH MARKETS. IN 2007, SG&A INCLUDES INCREASES IN

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND EXIT ACTIVITIES, NET OF

THE GAIN ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE ($108 MILLION COMBINED NET EXPENSE), WHICH

INCREASED SG&A AS A PERCENT OF SALES BY 0.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS. 2006

INCLUDED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND SETTLEMENT COSTS OF A PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED

ANTITRUST CLASS ACTION ($238 MILLION COMBINED EXPENSE), WHICH INCREASED 2006

SG&A AS A PERCENT OF SALES BY 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINTS. IN DOLLARS, SG&A

DECREASED $51 MILLION WHEN COMPARING 2007 TO 2006, WITH THE CHANGE IN RESTRUCTURING

AND OTHER ITEMS YEAR-ON-YEAR DECREASING SG&A BY $130 MILLION,

PHARMACEUTICAL SG&A SPENDING DECREASING $241 MILLION AND OTHER SG&A

SPENDING INCREASING $320 MILLION, OR APPROXIMATELY 7 PERCENT IN DOLLARS.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

PERCENT OF NET SALES DECREASED 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT IN 2007 WHEN COMPARED TO

2006, AS EXPENSES INCURRED IN 2006 IN THE COMPANYS NOW-DIVESTED

R&D-INTENSIVE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS DID NOT REPEAT IN 2007. NON-PHARMACEUTICAL

ONGOING R&D EXPENSES, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, WERE UP

APPROXIMATELY 11 PERCENT IN DOLLARS, AS THE COMPANY INVESTED IN FUTURE

TECHNOLOGIES AND GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. 2006 SPENDING INCLUDED A $95 MILLION

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGE (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2) AND $75

MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS (NOTE 4), WHICH INCREASED 2006 R&D AS A

PERCENT OF SALES BY 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS. IN DOLLARS, R&D SPENDING

DECREASED $154 MILLION WHEN COMPARING 2007 TO 2006, WITH THE CHANGE IN

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS YEAR-ON-YEAR DECREASING R&D BY $174 MILLION,

2006 PHARMACEUTICAL SG&A SPENDING DECREASING $120 MILLION AND OTHER R&D

SPENDING INCREASING $140 MILLION, OR APPROXIMATELY 11 PERCENT IN DOLLARS.

OPERATING INCOME.

3M USES OPERATING

INCOME AS ONE OF ITS PRIMARY BUSINESS SEGMENT PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TOOLS.

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED IN 2008 TO 20.6 PERCENT OF SALES, NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED BY RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, EXIT ACTIVITIES AND A LOSS ON SALE OF

BUSINESSES THAT WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GAIN ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE, WHICH

COMBINED DECREASED OPERATING INCOME BY 1.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS ($269 MILLION).

OPERATING INCOME MARGINS OF 25.3 PERCENT IN 2007 WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY

2.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS ($681 MILLION) FROM THE GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND

REAL ESTATE, NET OF ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXIT

ACTIVITIES. OPERATING INCOME MARGINS OF 24.8 PERCENT FOR 2006 WERE POSITIVELY

IMPACTED BY 2.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS ($523 MILLION) FROM THE GAIN ON SALE OF

PORTIONS OF THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS, NET OF RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER

ACTIONS. ADJUSTING FOR THE PRECEDING ITEMS, OPERATING INCOME MARGINS IN 2007

WERE SIMILAR TO 2006.

THE INDUSTRIAL AND

TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT SERVES A BROAD RANGE OF MARKETS, SUCH AS APPLIANCE,

PAPER AND PACKAGING, FOOD AND BEVERAGE, ELECTRONICS, AUTOMOTIVE ORIGINAL

EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) AND AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET (AUTO BODY SHOPS AND

RETAIL). INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION PRODUCTS INCLUDE TAPES, A WIDE VARIETY

OF COATED AND NON-WOVEN ABRASIVES, ADHESIVES, SPECIALTY MATERIALS, FILTRATION

PRODUCTS, CLOSURE SYSTEMS FOR PERSONAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS, AND COMPONENTS AND

PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED IN THE MANUFACTURE, REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF

AUTOMOTIVE, MARINE, AIRCRAFT AND SPECIALTY VEHICLES.

2008 CAN BE

CHARACTERIZED AS A TALE OF TWO DISTINCT CHAPTERS FOR INDUSTRIAL AND

TRANSPORTATION. THE FIRST WAS JANUARY THROUGH OCTOBER, CHARACTERIZED BY

OUTSTANDING TOP-AND BOTTOM-LINE GROWTH ACROSS MOST OF THE PORTFOLIO; THE SECOND

CHAPTER WAS THE COMBINED MONTHS OF NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER, WHEN MANY LARGE

CUSTOMERS SLOWED THEIR OPERATIONS. 3M EXPECTS THAT THE STRENGTH OF ITS NEW

PRODUCTS, SUPPLY CHAIN IMPROVEMENTS AND EXPANSION INTO AREAS LIKE ENERGY,

AEROSPACE, FILTRATION AND NOW RENEWABLE ENERGY, WILL HELP CARRY IT THROUGH SOME

VERY CHALLENGING TIMES.

AMONG 3MS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS, INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION HAS BEEN AMONG THOSE MOST

AFFECTED BY RECENT ECONOMIC CONTRACTIONS, PARTICULARLY IN BIG INDUSTRIES SUCH

AS AUTOMOTIVE AND ELECTRONICS. WITH WORLDWIDE INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION IN DECLINE,

3MS INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION BUSINESS HAD FOURTH QUARTER 2008 SALES OF

$1.7 BILLION, AN 11.3 PERCENT DECLINE COMPARED TO 2007. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES

WERE DOWN 6.3 PERCENT, INCLUDING A POSITIVE 3.2 PERCENT IMPACT FROM

ACQUISITIONS. NOT ALL DIVISIONS WITHIN INDUSTRIAL WERE IMPACTED EQUALLY IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER. THOSE THAT ARE HEAVILY LINKED TO AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURING,

NAMELY AUTOMOTIVE OEM AND 3M DYNEON, SAW DECLINES OF MORE THAN 20 PERCENT, AS

DID BUSINESSES SELLING TO THE ELECTRONICS INDUSTRY, SUCH AS HIGH-TECH TAPES AND

ADHESIVES. MOST OTHER DIVISIONS EXPERIENCED LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES CONTRACTIONS

OF LESS THAN 10 PERCENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT BRIGHT SPOT

IN THE QUARTER WAS THE AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET BUSINESS, WHICH CONTRIBUTED SOLID

LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH. GEOGRAPHICALLY, FOURTH QUARTER 2008 LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES

WERE DOWN IN ALL REGIONS, WITH THE LARGEST DECLINES IN THE U.S. AND ASIA

PACIFIC, FOLLOWED BY EUROPE. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES WERE FLAT IN LATIN AMERICA.

OPERATING INCOME IN THE FOURTH QUARTER DECLINED 42 PERCENT TO $203 MILLION,

WHICH INCLUDED NET CHARGES OF $36 MILLION FOR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT

ACTIVITIES.

FULL-YEAR 2008

SALES LOOKED FAR MORE POSITIVE, WITH SALES UP 7.6 PERCENT TO $7.8 BILLION.

LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH RATES WERE STRONGEST IN THE AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET

BUSINESS. 3M ALSO DROVE STRONG SALES GROWTH IN TWO OF ITS LARGEST DIVISIONS,

NAMELY ABRASIVES AND INDUSTRIAL TAPES AND ADHESIVES. CLOSURE SYSTEMS FOR

PERSONAL HYGIENE PRODUCTS ALSO SHOWED GOOD GROWTH. GEOGRAPHICALLY, ALL MAJOR

REGIONS DROVE POSITIVE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH. STRONG MARKET PENETRATION

CONTINUED IN EMERGING ECONOMIES, ESPECIALLY THE HIGH GROWTH BRICP COUNTRIES

(BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA, CHINA AND POLAND), WHERE THE BUSINESS DROVE STRONG

ORGANIC LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH. OPERATING INCOME DECLINED, BUT INCREASED AFTER

ADJUSTING FOR $66 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES

(DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW). STRONG OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE WAS THE KEY TO PROTECTING

THE BOTTOM LINE AS FULL-YEAR OPERATING MARGINS TOTALED 18.9 PERCENT, WITH

OPERATING INCOME MARGINS AT 19.7 PERCENT AFTER ADJUSTING FOR RESTRUCTURING AND

EXIT ACTIVITIES.

INDUSTRIAL AND

TRANSPORTATION RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT ACTIVITIES TOTALED $66 MILLION FOR TOTAL

YEAR 2008. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS TOTALING

$40 MILLION (PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $4 MILLION REDUCTION IN PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED

EXIT ACTIVITY CHARGES) WERE COMPRISED OF SEVERANCE AND RELATED BENEFITS

TOTALING $33 MILLION AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS OF $7 MILLION. NET EXIT ACTIVITY

CHARGES OF $26 MILLION IN 2008 LARGELY RELATED TO EMPLOYEE REDUCTIONS AT AN

INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION MANUFACTURING FACILITY LOCATED IN THE UNITED

KINGDOM, WHICH TOTALED $19 MILLION. THIS COMPARED TO RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND

EXIT ACTIVITIES OF $9 MILLION IN 2007.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INDUSTRIAL AND

TRANSPORTATION CONTINUES TO INVEST IN INNOVATIVE NEW PRODUCTS ALONG WITH

COMPLEMENTARY GAP-FILL ACQUISITIONS, EVIDENCED BY THE CLOSING OF EIGHT

ACQUISITIONS IN 2008, WITH SOME OF THE LARGER ACQUISITIONS SUMMARIZED AS

FOLLOWS. IN JULY 2008, 3M ACQUIRED K&H SURFACE TECHNOLOGIES PTY. LTD.,

AN AUSTRALIAN-BASED MANUFACTURING COMPANY SPECIALIZING IN A RANGE OF REPAIR

PRODUCTS FOR THE PROFESSIONAL DO-IT-YOURSELF AUTOMOTIVE REFINISH MARKETS. IN AUGUST 2008,

3M ACQUIRED POLYFOAM PRODUCTS INC., A STRUCTURAL ADHESIVES COMPANY SPECIALIZING

IN FOAM ADHESIVES FOR TILE ROOFING AND OTHER ADHESIVE PRODUCTS FOR THE BUILDING

INDUSTRY. IN OCTOBER 2008, 3M COMPLETED ITS ACQUISITION OF EMFI S.A. AND

SAPO S.A.S., MANUFACTURERS OF POLYURETHANE-BASED STRUCTURAL ADHESIVES AND

SEALANTS HEADQUARTERED IN HAGUENAU, FRANCE. IN OCTOBER 2008, 3M ALSO

COMPLETED ITS ACQUISITION OF MEGUIARS INC., A 100-YEAR-OLD BUSINESS THAT

MANUFACTURES THE LEADING MEGUIARS BRAND OF CAR CARE PRODUCTS FOR CLEANING AND

PROTECTING AUTOMOTIVE SURFACES, WHICH IS HEADQUARTERED IN IRVINE, CALIFORNIA.

IN 2007,

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 5.8 PERCENT, INCLUDING 1.8 PERCENT GROWTH FROM

ACQUISITIONS. SALES GROWTH WAS BROAD-BASED, LED BY INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES AND

TAPES, AUTOMOTIVE AFTERMARKET, ABRASIVES AND AUTOMOTIVE OEM BUSINESSES. ALL

GEOGRAPHIC AREAS CONTRIBUTED POSITIVELY TO GROWTH. SIGNIFICANT MANUFACTURING

INVESTMENTS WERE MADE IN EMERGING ECONOMIES SUCH AS INDIA, CHINA AND POLAND TO

SIMPLIFY THE SUPPLY CHAIN AND GET CLOSER TO LOCAL CUSTOMERS. GOOD OPERATIONAL

DISCIPLINE HELPED DELIVER OPERATING INCOME GROWTH OF 11.9 PERCENT, WITH

OPERATING INCOME MARGINS OF 20.6 PERCENT. OPERATING

INCOME IN 2007 INCLUDED $9

MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXIT ACTIVITY EXPENSES, PRIMARILY COMPRISED

OF SEVERANCE AND RELATED BENEFITS. OPERATING INCOME IN 2006 INCLUDED $15

MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND

SEVERANCE AND RELATED BENEFITS.

IN MARCH 2005, 3MS

AUTOMOTIVE BUSINESS COMPLETED THE PURCHASE OF 19 PERCENT OF TI&M

BETEILIGUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH (TI&M) FOR APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION. TI&M

IS THE PARENT COMPANY OF I&T INNOVATION TECHNOLOGY ENTWICKLUNGSUND HOLDING

AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT (I&T), AN AUSTRIAN MAKER OF FLAT FLEXIBLE CABLE AND

CIRCUITRY. PURSUANT TO A SHAREHOLDERS AGREEMENT, 3M MARKETED THE FIRMS FLAT

FLEXIBLE WIRING SYSTEMS FOR AUTOMOTIVE INTERIOR APPLICATIONS TO THE GLOBAL

AUTOMOTIVE MARKET. I&T FILED A PETITION FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN AUGUST 2006.

AS PART OF ITS AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE THE SHARES OF TI&M, THE COMPANY WAS

GRANTED A PUT OPTION, WHICH GAVE THE COMPANY THE RIGHT TO SELL BACK ITS ENTIRE

OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN TI&M TO THE OTHER INVESTORS FROM WHOM 3M ACQUIRED ITS

19 PERCENT INTEREST. THE PUT OPTION BECAME EXERCISABLE JANUARY 1, 2007.

THE COMPANY EXERCISED THE PUT OPTION AND RECOVERED APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION OF

ITS INVESTMENT FROM ONE OF THE INVESTORS BASED IN BELGIUM IN FEBRUARY 2007.

THE OTHER TWO TI&M INVESTORS HAVE FILED A BANKRUPTCY PETITION IN AUSTRIA.

THE COMPANY IS PURSUING RECOVERY OF THE BALANCE OF ITS INVESTMENT BOTH THROUGH

THE AUSTRIAN BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS AND PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE SHARE

PURCHASE AGREEMENT. THE COMPANY RECEIVED APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION OF ITS

INVESTMENT BACK IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. THE COMPANY BELIEVES COLLECTION

OF ITS REMAINING INVESTMENT IS PROBABLE AND, AS A RESULT, NO IMPAIRMENT RESERVE

HAS BEEN RECORDED.

A GROWING ARRAY OF SOLUTIONS  FROM LIBRARY PATRON SELF-CHECKOUT SYSTEMS TO

TRACKING PACKAGES.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2008, SALES IN THIS BUSINESS ROSE 2.9 PERCENT TO $769 MILLION. LOCAL-CURRENCY

SALES INCREASED 13 PERCENT, DRIVEN BY 3MS 2008 ACQUISITION OF AEARO

GROWTH IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. ON A GEOGRAPHIC BASIS, SALES FOR THE QUARTER WERE

STRONGEST IN THE UNITED STATES, FOLLOWED BY THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION. OPERATING

AEARO, ACQUIRED IN APRIL 2008, MANUFACTURES AND

SELLS PERSONAL PROTECTION AND ENERGY ABSORBING PRODUCTS. AEARO EXPANDED 3MS

PLATFORM BY ADDING HEARING PROTECTION AS WELL AS EYEWEAR AND FALL PROTECTION

PRODUCT LINES TO 3MS EXISTING LINE OF RESPIRATORY PRODUCTS.

IN JULY 2008,

3M ACQUIRED QUEST TECHNOLOGIES INC., A MANUFACTURER OF ENVIRONMENTAL MONITORING

EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING NOISE, HEAT STRESS AND VIBRATION MONITORS. THE SALE OF

HIGHJUMP SOFTWARE (DISCUSSED BELOW) RESULTED IN

A 1.7 PERCENTAGE POINT PENALTY TO FULL-YEAR SALES.

WERE UP 10.8 PERCENT. ACQUISITIONS CONTRIBUTED 7.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THIS

GROWTH, INCLUDING A CARRY-OVER BENEFIT FROM THE AUGUST 2006 ACQUISITION OF

SECURITY PRINTING AND SYSTEMS LIMITED. SALES GROWTH WAS LED BY THE RESPIRATORY

PROTECTION BUSINESS, FOLLOWED BY THE SECURITY SYSTEMS, CORROSION PROTECTION AND

BUILDING AND COMMERCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES. 2007 SALES GROWTH WAS HELD BACK BY

MARKET SOFTNESS IN THE U.S. RESIDENTIAL CONSTRUCTION MARKET, WHICH NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED THE ROOFING GRANULES BUSINESS. THE DECLINE IN THE ROOFING GRANULES

BUSINESS REDUCED SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES 2007 SALES GROWTH BY

APPROXIMATELY 1.5 PERCENT. GEOGRAPHICALLY, SALES GROWTH WAS LED BY EUROPE AND

THE COMBINED LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA AREA. THIS SEGMENT RECORDED A

RESTRUCTURING CHARGE OF $29 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007 RELATED TO

IMPROVEMENT, BUILDING MAINTENANCE AND OTHER MARKETS. PRODUCTS IN THIS SEGMENT

INCLUDE OFFICE SUPPLY PRODUCTS, STATIONERY PRODUCTS, CONSTRUCTION AND HOME

IMPROVEMENT PRODUCTS, HOME CARE PRODUCTS, PROTECTIVE MATERIAL PRODUCTS AND

CONSUMER HEALTH CARE PRODUCTS.

IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2008, CONSUMER AND OFFICE SALES DECLINED 11.2 PERCENT TO $765

MILLION. LOCAL CURRENCY SALES WERE DOWN 6.5 PERCENT AND CURRENCY IMPACTS

REDUCED SALES BY JUST UNDER 5 PERCENTAGE POINTS. U.S. SALES DECLINED BY 13

PERCENT, HEAVILY IMPACTED BY THE ONGOING SLUMP IN U.S. CONSUMER RETAIL SPENDING

LEVELS. MORE THAN 50 PERCENT OF SALES IN CONSUMER AND OFFICE ARE GENERATED

WITHIN THE UNITED STATES. BY FAR THE BIGGEST CONTRIBUTOR TO THIS DECLINE WAS

THE RETAIL AND WHOLESALE OFFICE CHANNEL. THE COMBINATION OF MASSIVE OFFICE

WORKER LAYOFFS, COUPLED WITH ACROSS-THE-BOARD DECLINES IN OFFICE RETAIL FOOT

TRAFFIC, HAD A DRAMATIC AND NEGATIVE IMPACT ON SALES. 3M BUSINESSES SERVING

OTHER U.S. RETAIL CHANNELS PERFORMED WELL IN THE FOURTH QUARTER DESPITE THIS ROUGH

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. THIS BUSINESS POSTED POSITIVE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES FOR

ITS HOME CARE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS SCOTCH-BRITE SCRUB SPONGES, AND FOR ITS

DO-IT-YOURSELF RETAIL CHANNEL. ELSEWHERE AROUND THE GLOBE, 3MS CONSUMER AND

OFFICE BUSINESS DROVE POSITIVE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH IN BOTH LATIN

AMERICA AND ASIA PACIFIC, BUT OVERALL GROWTH WAS MUTED BY DECLINES IN EUROPE.

WORLDWIDE OPERATING INCOME DECLINED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, INCLUDING THE IMPACT

OF $18 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING CHARGES, WHICH CONTRIBUTED 11.4 PERCENTAGE

POINTS OF THIS 35.5 PERCENT DECLINE.

FOR TOTAL YEAR

2008, CONSUMER AND OFFICE SALES GREW JUST OVER 1 PERCENT. THIS BUSINESS HAS

SUCCESSFULLY CREATED NEW PRODUCTS AND DESIGNED NEW PROGRAMS AND PLANOGRAMS WITH

THEIR LARGE U.S. CUSTOMERS IN ORDER TO MITIGATE WHAT IS A VERY TOUGH END-MARKET

SITUATION. SALES GROWTH WAS LED BY HOME CARE AND DO-IT-YOURSELF PRODUCTS.

OPERATING INCOME DECLINED 4.1 PERCENT AND MARGINS WERE IN EXCESS OF 19 PERCENT,

AN OUTSTANDING RETURN CONSIDERING WHAT WAS A SLOW U.S. MARKET ENVIRONMENT AND A

SYNCHRONIZED SLOWDOWN IN GROWTH ACROSS MOST OTHERS AREAS OF THE WORLD.

GEOGRAPHICALLY, SALES GROWTH WAS LED BY ASIA PACIFIC AND LATIN AMERICA.

OPERATING INCOME WAS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE $18 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING

CHARGES DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH.

GOING FORWARD, 3M

EXPECTS SALES GROWTH IN THE CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENT TO CONTINUE TO BE LED

BY INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS AS U.S. GROWTH WILL REMAIN UNCERTAIN OVER THE NEAR

TERM DUE TO CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

IN 2007, CONSUMER AND

OFFICE EXPERIENCED BROAD-BASED LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH OF 5.0 PERCENT, LED

BY THE CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT AND HOME CLEANING BUSINESSES. IN

CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT, PRODUCTS SUCH AS SCOTCH-BLUE PAINTERS

TAPE, FILTRETE FURNACE FILTERS AND COMMAND MOUNTING PRODUCTS, HELPED DRIVE

RESULTS. GEOGRAPHICALLY, INTERNATIONAL GROWTH LED SALES, WHILE A SLOWDOWN IN

THE UNITED STATES WAS DRIVEN BY SOFT OVERALL U.S. RETAIL SALES AND A SOFT

RESIDENTIAL HOUSING ENVIRONMENT. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 9.2 PERCENT AND

EXCEEDED 20 PERCENT OF SALES.

ELECTRONIC DISPLAYS; COMPUTER SCREEN FILTERS; REFLECTIVE SHEETING FOR

TRANSPORTATION SAFETY; COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS SYSTEMS; AND PROJECTION SYSTEMS,

INCLUDING MOBILE DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY AND VISUAL SYSTEMS PRODUCTS. THE OPTICAL

FILM BUSINESS

PROVIDES FILMS THAT SERVE NUMEROUS MARKET SEGMENTS

OF THE ELECTRONIC DISPLAY INDUSTRY. 3M PROVIDES DISTINCT PRODUCTS FOR FIVE

MARKET SEGMENTS, INCLUDING PRODUCTS FOR: 1) LCD COMPUTER MONITORS 2) LCD

TELEVISIONS 3) HANDHELD DEVICES SUCH AS CELLULAR PHONES 4) NOTEBOOK PCS AND 5)

AUTOMOTIVE DISPLAYS.

RESULTS IN THIS BUSINESS

CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY END-MARKET CHALLENGES IN 3MS OPTICAL FILMS

BUSINESS, WHICH IS IN THE MIDST OF TRANSITION FROM A HYPER-GROWTH BUSINESS A

FEW YEARS AGO TO ONE THAT IS MORE COMMODITIZED IN NATURE. DEMAND FOR OPTICAL

FILMS SLOWED CONSIDERABLY IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER OF 2008 AS TV,

DESKTOP MONITOR AND NOTEBOOK PC MAKERS CANCELLED ORDERS FOR LARGE-SIZE LCD

PANELS DUE TO WEAK HOLIDAY SEASON SALES, REFLECTING THE GLOBAL DOWNTURN IN BOTH

CONSUMER AND CORPORATE DEMAND. FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER, 3M POSTED SALES OF $685

MILLION IN DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS. SALES DECLINED 28 PERCENT, OR ABOUT 8 PERCENT

EXCLUDING OPTICAL. TRAFFIC SAFETY SYSTEMS POSTED LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH OF

NEARLY 3 PERCENT, AS HIGHWAY INFRASTRUCTURE PROJECTS AROUND THE WORLD CONTINUE

TO GROW AT A MODEST RATE. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES DECLINED BY 6.3 PERCENT IN 3MS

COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS BUSINESS AND BY 48 PERCENT IN OPTICAL SYSTEMS. OPERATING

INCOME IN THE FOURTH QUARTER DECLINED 80 PERCENT, WHICH INCLUDED NET CHARGES OF

$22 MILLION FOR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES.

FOR THE FULL YEAR OF

2008, SALES DECLINED 16.6 PERCENT, DRIVING OPERATING INCOME DOWN 50 PERCENT TO

$580 MILLION. OPERATING MARGINS WERE AT 17.8 PERCENT FOR 2008. 3M HAS TAKEN

AGGRESSIVE ACTION DURING 2008 TO REDUCE ITS COST STRUCTURE ACROSS ALL

BUSINESSES WITHIN DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS WITH PARTICULAR FOCUS ON THE OPTICAL FILM

BUSINESS. 3M CONTINUES TO CHAMPION THE ENERGY SAVING STORY IN THE LCD MONITOR

SEGMENT, AND IS GAINING TRACTION, BUT VOLUMES REMAIN LOW AT THIS EARLY STAGE.

SECOND-HALF 2008

RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND EXIT ACTIVITIES OF $42 MILLION REDUCED OPERATING INCOME

FOR TOTAL YEAR 2008. THESE EXPENSES WERE COMPRISED OF SEVERANCE/RELATED

BENEFITS AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS. IN 2007, 3M RECORDED A GAIN ON THE SALE OF ITS

OPTICOM PRIORITY CONTROL SYSTEMS AND CANOGA TRAFFIC DETECTION BUSINESSES, WHICH

WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EXPENSES RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT ACTIVITIES.

THESE ITEMS ON A COMBINED BASIS BENEFITED OPERATING INCOME BY $51 MILLION IN

2007 (AS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH). IN AGGREGATE, THESE

ITEMS CONTRIBUTED APPROXIMATELY 6.0 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THIS 50.1 PERCENT

OPERATING INCOME DECLINE WHEN COMPARING 2008 TO 2007. IN ADDITION, THE 2008

RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT ACTIVITY CHARGES REDUCED 2008 OPERATING INCOME MARGINS

BY 1.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS, WHILE THE 2007 NET BENEFIT CONTRIBUTED 1.3 PERCENTAGE

POINTS OF THE 29.8 PERCENT OPERATING INCOME MARGIN FOR 2007.

IN

2007, DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 2.7 PERCENT,

EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE OPTICOM/CANOGA BUSINESS SALE. THE COMPANY RECORDED

POSITIVE SALES GROWTH IN ALL MAJOR BUSINESSES  COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS, TRAFFIC

SAFETY SYSTEMS AND OPTICAL SYSTEMS. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS

SAW STRONG PERFORMANCE IN THE VEHICLE WRAPPING MARKET WHERE 3M PROVIDES FILMS,

INKS AND OTHER PRODUCTS FOR THIS ROLLING BILLBOARD INDUSTRY. THE TRAFFIC

SAFETY SYSTEMS BUSINESS ALSO EXPERIENCED GROWTH FOR THE YEAR, WITH FASTER

GROWTH INTERNATIONALLY AS THE 3M REFLECTIVE SOLUTIONS FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION

PROJECTS ARE A PERFECT MATCH IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES THAT ARE ADDING

INFRASTRUCTURE. IN JUNE 2007, 3M COMPLETED THE SALE OF ITS OPTICOM

PRIORITY CONTROL SYSTEMS AND CANOGA TRAFFIC DETECTION BUSINESSES. 3M RECEIVED

PROCEEDS OF $80 MILLION FROM THIS TRANSACTION AND RECOGNIZED AN OPERATING

INCOME GAIN OF $68 MILLION IN THE DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT IN THE SECOND

QUARTER OF 2007. IN ADDITION, DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS RECORDED RESTRUCTURING AND

OTHER EXIT ACTIVITY EXPENSES OF $17 MILLION IN 2007. OPERATING INCOME IN 2007

WAS $1.163 BILLION, INCLUDING THIS AGGREGATE NET OPERATING INCOME BENEFIT OF

$51 MILLION,

DISPLAY TAPES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS, AND TOUCH

SCREENS AND TOUCH MONITORS.

THIS BUSINESS

SERVES A NUMBER OF END-MARKETS, THE MOST IMPORTANT BEING CONSUMER ELECTRONICS

AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS, ALONG WITH THE GLOBAL POWER UTILITY INDUSTRY. IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, THE WEAK HOLIDAY SEASON EXPERIENCED BY THE CONSUMER

ELECTRONICS RETAILERS HAD A LARGE AND NEGATIVE IMPACT ON SALES IN THIS

BUSINESS. LIKEWISE THE GLOBAL TELECOMMUNICATIONS SECTOR CONTINUES TO CUT

CAPITAL SPENDING ON NEW CAPACITY AND ON UPGRADES OF EXISTING EQUIPMENT. 3M HAD

A LARGE NUMBER OF EQUIPMENT ORDERS CANCELLED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008.

AS A RESULT OF THIS END-MARKET CONTRACTION, SALES IN ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS

DECLINED BY 15 PERCENT IN THE FOURTH QUARTER. SALES IN LOCAL CURRENCY DECREASED

ABOUT 12 PERCENT, AND CURRENCY IMPACTS HURT SALES BY ABOUT 3 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

OPERATING INCOME DECLINED 38.8 PERCENT, WHICH INCLUDED $7 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING

EXPENSES.

FOR THE FULL-YEAR 2008,

SALES IN ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS INCREASED 1 PERCENT TO $2.8 BILLION, WHILE

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 8 PERCENT TO $531 MILLION. OPERATING MARGINS WERE AT

19 PERCENT. THE ELECTRICAL MARKETS AND ELECTRONIC MARKETS MATERIALS BUSINESSES

DROVE GROWTH. THE COMMUNICATIONS MARKETS AND ELECTRONICS SOLUTIONS BUSINESSES

REMAIN SOFT. 3M ALSO CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE DECLINES IN THE FLEXIBLE CIRCUITS

BUSINESS WHERE A NUMBER OF PRODUCT SOLUTIONS ARE GOING END-OF-LIFE. OPERATING INCOME

IN 2008 WAS IMPACTED BY $7 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, WHILE 2007

INCLUDED $18 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, PRIMARILY FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS DECISION TO CLOSE A FACILITY IN WISCONSIN, AND

$23 MILLION FOR EMPLOYEE REDUCTIONS AND FIXED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS RELATED TO THE

CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN FLEXIBLE CIRCUIT MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS. IN

AGGREGATE, THESE ITEMS CONTRIBUTED 6.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THE REPORTED 8.0

PERCENT OPERATING INCOME GROWTH WHEN COMPARING 2008 TO THE 2007.

IN 2007, THE

ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 1.0 PERCENT,

DRIVEN BY 1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM ACQUISITIONS. STRONG SALES GROWTH IN THE

COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRICAL MARKETS BUSINESSES WAS OFFSET BY DECLINES IN THE

FLEXIBLE CIRCUITS BUSINESS, WHICH SUPPLIES COMPONENTS PRIMARILY TO THE INK JET

PRINTER MARKET, AS A NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS GO END-OF-LIFE. SOFTNESS IN THIS

BUSINESS HELD BACK OVERALL ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SALES AND OPERATING

INCOME GROWTH BY APPROXIMATELY 2.5 PERCENT AND 10 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 19.7 PERCENT AS THIS SEGMENT HAS DRIVEN PRODUCTIVITY

IMPROVEMENTS AND TAKEN ACTIONS TO IMPROVE ITS COMPETITIVENESS. OPERATING INCOME

IN 2007 WAS PENALIZED BY A $23 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO CONSOLIDATING ITS

GLOBAL FLEXIBLE CIRCUITS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS AND $18 MILLION IN

RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, PRIMARILY FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS DECISION TO CLOSE A FACILITY IN WISCONSIN. COMBINED, THESE TWO ITEMS

WHILE 3M MANAGES ITS

BUSINESSES GLOBALLY AND BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS ARE THE MOST

RELEVANT MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA

AS A SECONDARY PERFORMANCE MEASURE. EXPORT SALES ARE GENERALLY REPORTED WITHIN

THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WHERE THE FINAL SALES TO 3M CUSTOMERS ARE MADE. A PORTION

OF THE PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS SOLD BY 3MS OPERATIONS TO ITS CUSTOMERS ARE

EXPORTED BY THESE CUSTOMERS TO DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AS CUSTOMERS MOVE

THEIR OPERATIONS FROM ONE GEOGRAPHIC AREA TO ANOTHER, 3MS RESULTS WILL FOLLOW.

THUS, NET SALES IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA ARE NOT INDICATIVE OF END-USER

CONSUMPTION IN THAT GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

IN 2008, U.S.

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 2.7 PERCENT, WITH ACQUISITIONS CONTRIBUTING 5.3

PERCENTAGE POINTS. U.S. ORGANIC LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH WAS LED BY HEALTH

CARE. SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES AND INDUSTRIAL AND

TRANSPORTATION ALSO DROVE POSITIVE SALES GROWTH, HELPED BY ACQUISITIONS. THIS

WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SOFTNESS IN THE ELECTRONIC SOLUTIONS BUSINESS AND

WEAKNESS IN A FEW BUSINESSES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THE SLOWDOWN IN THE U.S.

HOUSING, ROAD CONSTRUCTION AND MASS RETAIL MARKETS AND OFFICE SUPPLY

BUSINESSES. ASIA PACIFIC LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES DECLINED 5.9 PERCENT. THE

SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN OPTICAL SYSTEMS WITHIN DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS MORE THAN

OFFSET THE SALES GROWTH IN THE OTHER FIVE BUSINESS SEGMENTS. SALES IN JAPAN

TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $2.2 BILLION, WITH LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES DOWN 5.2 PERCENT

FROM 2007. EUROPE LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 2.8 PERCENT, HELPED BY

ACQUISITIONS, WITH GROWTH IN SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES, HEALTH CARE,

AND INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION. IN THE COMBINED LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA

AREA, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 12.8 PERCENT, WITH GROWTH IN ALL BUSINESS

SEGMENTS. FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION POSITIVELY IMPACTED EUROPE SALES BY 4.0

PERCENT, THE COMBINED LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA AREA SALES BY 2.4 PERCENT, AND

THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA BY 3.2 PERCENT, AS THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENED IN AGGREGATE

AGAINST CURRENCIES IN THESE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. FOR 2008, INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 64 PERCENT OF 3MS SALES.

IN 2008,

RESTRUCTURING

ACTIONS, EXIT ACTIVITIES AND A LOSS ON SALE OF

BUSINESSES, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A GAIN ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE,

DECREASED WORLDWIDE OPERATING INCOME BY

$269 MILLION, WITH THE LARGEST IMPACT IN

THE UNITED STATES AND

EUROPE. IN 2007, THE GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND A GAIN ON SALE OF REAL

ESTATE, NET OF RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS, INCREASED WORLDWIDE OPERATING

INCOME BY $681 MILLION, WITH THE LARGEST IMPACT IN EUROPE. IN 2006, THE GAIN ON

SALE, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS INCREASED WORLDWIDE OPERATING INCOME BY

$523 MILLION, WITH THE LARGEST IMPACT IN THE UNITED STATES.

SINCE 3M SOLD ITS GLOBAL BRANDED

PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IN DECEMBER 2006 AND JANUARY 2007, BOTH

SALES GROWTH AND OPERATING INCOME WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED WHEN COMPARING 2007

TO 2006. SALES IN 2006 FOR PHARMACEUTICALS TOTALED $332 MILLION IN THE UNITED

STATES, $315 MILLION IN EUROPE, $77 MILLION IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA, AND $50

MILLION IN THE LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA AREA.

IN ADDITION TO 2008 SALES

AND OPERATING INCOME RESULTS PROVIDED ABOVE, REFER TO NOTE 18 FOR GEOGRAPHIC

EMPLOYMENT

INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 2,900 PEOPLE SINCE YEAR-END 2007, WITH ACQUISITIONS

DURING 2008 ADDING APPROXIMATELY 3,700 PEOPLE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. IN 2008

AND 2007, 3M INCREASED EMPLOYEES IN THE BRICP COUNTRIES (BRAZIL, INDIA, RUSSIA,

CHINA AND POLAND), WHERE TOTAL SALES INCREASED MORE THAN 15 PERCENT IN BOTH

YEARS. THESE INCREASES WERE OFFSET BY REDUCTIONS IN EMPLOYMENT IN 2008 FOR A

PORTION OF THE JOB ELIMINATIONS THAT WERE ANNOUNCED IN CONNECTION WITH

RESTRUCTURING AND EXIT ACTIVITIES. EMPLOYMENT INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 900

PEOPLE WHEN COMPARING YEAR-END 2007 TO YEAR-END 2006, WITH ACQUISITIONS ADDING

APPROXIMATELY 2,500 EMPLOYEES, WHILE RESTRUCTURING AND THE PHARMACEUTICALS

DIVESTITURE REDUCED EMPLOYMENT.

CAPITAL SPENDING/NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

THE BULK OF 3M

CAPITAL SPENDING HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN IN THE UNITED STATES, RESULTING IN

HIGHER NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT BALANCES IN THE UNITED STATES. THE

COMPANY IS STRIVING TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN ITS MANUFACTURING AND SOURCING WITH

GEOGRAPHIC MARKET SALES, AND BECAUSE APPROXIMATELY 64 PERCENT OF SALES ARE

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THIS WOULD INCREASE PRODUCTION OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES, HELPING TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND REDUCE WORKING CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $1.471 BILLION IN 2008, SIMILAR TO

2007. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REDUCED BY MORE THAN 30 PERCENT

IN 2009.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

INFORMATION

REGARDING SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN NOTE 1. AS STATED IN

NOTE 1, THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS,

LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE AND ON

VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER THE CIRCUMSTANCES,

THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS ABOUT THE CARRYING

VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY APPARENT FROM OTHER

SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

THE COMPANY

BELIEVES ITS MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES RELATE TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,

THE COMPANYS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND

INCOME TAXES. SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT, SELECTION AND

DISCLOSURE OF ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT COMMITTEE OF 3MS

BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE CATEGORIES OF

CLAIMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ESTIMATED ITS PROBABLE LIABILITY, THE AMOUNT

OF ITS LIABILITY ACCRUALS, AND THE ESTIMATES OF ITS RELATED INSURANCE

RECEIVABLES ARE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

PLEASE REFER TO THE SECTION ENTITLED ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE

RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTAINED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN

NOTE 14) FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH ESTIMATES.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

3M HAS VARIOUS

COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES

AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE

BENEFIT PLANS IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

(SFAS) NO. 87, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS, SFAS NO. 106, EMPLOYERS

ACCOUNTING FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, IN MEASURING PLAN

ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF NET PERIODIC

BENEFIT COST, AND SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87,

88, 106 AND 132(R), WHICH WAS ISSUED IN SEPTEMBER 2006 AND EFFECTIVE AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. SFAS NO. 158 REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO RECOGNIZE

THE UNDERFUNDED OR OVERFUNDED STATUS OF A DEFINED BENEFIT POSTRETIREMENT PLAN

AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND RECOGNIZE

CHANGES

30

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE FUNDED STATUS IN

THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME, WHICH IS A COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

PENSION BENEFITS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANS ARE GENERALLY BASED PRIMARILY ON EACH PARTICIPANTS

YEARS OF SERVICE, COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. TWO

CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS,

ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND LIABILITY MEASUREMENT. THE ASSUMED HEALTH

CARE TREND RATE IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE ASSUMPTION.

SEE NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN

DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES.

THE

COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE

DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLANS. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE

ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THE

COMPANY SETS ITS RATE TO REFLECT THE YIELD OF A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY,

FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD PRODUCE CASH FLOWS SUFFICIENT IN

TIMING AND AMOUNT TO SETTLE PROJECTED FUTURE BENEFITS. USING THIS METHODOLOGY,

THE COMPANY DETERMINED A DISCOUNT RATE OF 6.14% TO BE APPROPRIATE AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, WHICH IS AN INCREASE FROM THE 6.00% RATE USED AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2007.

A SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT IN

DETERMINING THE COMPANYS PENSION EXPENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 87

IS THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, WHICH IS BASED ON HISTORICAL RESULTS FOR

SIMILAR ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLAN, REFER TO

NOTE 11 FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THE 8.50% EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON

AN ANNUALIZED BASIS FOR 2009 IS DETERMINED.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2008, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED TOTAL CONSOLIDATED PRE-TAX PENSION EXPENSE (AFTER

SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS AND SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS) OF $89 MILLION,

DOWN FROM $190 MILLION IN 2007. PENSION EXPENSE (BEFORE SETTLEMENTS,

CURTAILMENTS AND SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS) IS ANTICIPATED TO INCREASE TO

APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION IN 2009. FOR THE PENSION PLANS, HOLDING ALL

OTHER FACTORS CONSTANT, AN INCREASE/DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS OF 0.25 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT WOULD DECREASE/INCREASE

2009 PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $26 MILLION FOR U.S. PENSION PLANS

AND APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION FOR INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS. ALSO, HOLDING ALL

OTHER FACTORS CONSTANT, AN INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN

LIABILITIES OF 0.25 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT WOULD DECREASE 2009 PENSION EXPENSE

BY APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION FOR U.S. PENSION PLANS AND APPROXIMATELY $12

MILLION FOR INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS. A DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE OF

0.25 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT WOULD INCREASE 2009 PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY

$31 MILLION FOR U.S. PENSION AND PLANS AND APPROXIMATELY $14 MILLION FOR

INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS. SEE NOTE 11 FOR DETAILS OF THE IMPACT OF A

ONE PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN ASSUMED HEALTH CARE TREND RATES ON THE

POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE BENEFIT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATION.

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS.

3M NET PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT TOTALED $6.9 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. MANAGEMENT

MAKES ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR WHICH ACTUAL RESULTS WILL EMERGE OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THIS

INCLUDES THE RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EMPLOYED IN THE BUSINESS,

INCLUDING ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE

CLOSELY MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND PERIODICALLY ADJUSTED AS CIRCUMSTANCES

WARRANT. FOR INSTANCE, EXPECTED ASSET LIVES MAY BE SHORTENED OR AN IMPAIRMENT

RECORDED BASED ON A CHANGE IN THE EXPECTED USE OF THE ASSET OR PERFORMANCE OF

THE RELATED ASSET GROUP. IMPAIRMENTS RECORDED IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006 RELATED TO

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 4.

3M GOODWILL TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $5.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, WHICH, BASED ON

IMPAIRMENT TESTING, IS NOT IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR GOODWILL IS DONE AT

A REPORTING UNIT LEVEL, WITH ALL GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO A REPORTING UNIT.

REPORTING UNITS ARE ONE LEVEL BELOW THE BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL (3M HAS SIX

BUSINESS SEGMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008), BUT CAN BE COMBINED WHEN

REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE SAME SEGMENT HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, 3M DID NOT COMBINE ANY OF ITS REPORTING UNITS FOR

IMPAIRMENT TESTING.

AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS

GENERALLY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNITS

NET ASSETS EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED USING EARNINGS FOR THE

REPORTING UNIT MULTIPLIED BY A PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO FOR COMPARABLE INDUSTRY

GROUPS, OR BY USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. 3M TYPICALLY USES THE

PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO APPROACH FOR STABLE AND GROWING BUSINESSES THAT HAVE A

LONG HISTORY AND TRACK RECORD OF GENERATING POSITIVE OPERATING INCOME AND CASH

FLOWS. 3M USES THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW APPROACH FOR START-UP, LOSS POSITION

AND DECLINING BUSINESSES, BUT ALSO USES DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW AS AN ADDITIONAL

TOOL FOR BUSINESSES THAT MAY BE GROWING AT A SLOWER RATE THAN PLANNED DUE TO

ECONOMIC OR OTHER CONDITIONS. 3M COMPLETES ITS ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTS IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF EACH YEAR.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, 3M HAD 34 PRIMARY REPORTING UNITS, WITH EIGHT REPORTING UNITS ACCOUNTING

FOR NEARLY 80 PERCENT OF THE GOODWILL. AT 3M, REPORTING UNITS GENERALLY

CORRESPOND TO A DIVISION. THESE EIGHT REPORTING UNITS WERE COMPRISED OF THE

FOLLOWING DIVISIONS: OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAFETY, CUNO,

OPTICAL SYSTEMS, ESPE, COMMUNICATION MARKETS, SECURITY SYSTEMS, INDUSTRIAL

ADHESIVES AND TAPES, AND HEALTH INFORMATION SYSTEMS. THESE

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EIGHT REPORTING UNITS ALL

GENERATED OPERATING INCOME FOR TOTAL YEAR 2008. AS PART OF ITS ANNUAL

IMPAIRMENT TESTING IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, 3M USED DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS

FOR ITS CUNO, OPTICAL SYSTEMS AND SECURITY SYSTEMS DIVISIONS. A

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS WAS PERFORMED FOR THE CUNO AND

OPTICAL SYSTEMS DIVISIONS, USING PROJECTED CASH FLOWS THAT WERE WEIGHTED BASED

ON DIFFERENT SALES GROWTH AND TERMINAL VALUE ASSUMPTIONS, AMONG OTHER FACTORS.

THE WEIGHTING WAS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF EACH

SCENARIO OCCURRING. THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FOR THE CUNO, OPTICAL SYSTEMS AND

SECURITY SYSTEMS DIVISIONS WERE ALL IN EXCESS OF THEIR RESPECTIVE NET BOOK

VALUES, WITH NO IMPAIRMENT INDICATED.

IN 2008, IN ADDITION TO

USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS FOR CERTAIN REPORTING UNITS, 3M USED AN ADJUSTED

INDUSTRY PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO APPROACH FOR THE REMAINING REPORTING UNITS. 3M

ADJUSTED THE STATED APPLICABLE INDUSTRY PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO DOWNWARD FOR ITS

ANNUAL TEST IN THE FOURTH QUARTER, UNLIKE PRIOR YEARS WHEN NO ADJUSTMENT WAS

REQUIRED. WITHOUT THIS ADJUSTMENT, THE ADDITION OF EACH REPORTING UNITS

ESTIMATED MARKET VALUES WOULD HAVE BEEN SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF 3MS TOTAL

COMPANY MARKET VALUE, WHICH WOULD HAVE RESULTED IN AN UNUSUALLY HIGH IMPLIED

CONTROL PREMIUM. THE CONTROL PREMIUM IS DEFINED AS THE SUM OF THE INDIVIDUAL

REPORTING UNITS ESTIMATED MARKET VALUES COMPARED TO 3MS TOTAL COMPANY MARKET

VALUE, WITH THE SUM OF THE INDIVIDUAL VALUES TYPICALLY BEING LARGER THAN THE

VALUE FOR THE TOTAL COMPANY. FOR EXAMPLE, AT YEAR-END 2008, 3MS MARKET VALUE

WAS APPROXIMATELY $40 BILLION, BUT IF EACH REPORTING UNIT WAS SOLD

INDIVIDUALLY, 3MS VALUE WOULD BE APPROXIMATELY $52 BILLION USING A 30 PERCENT

CONTROL PREMIUM. 3M FACTORED DOWN ITS PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO SIGNIFICANTLY FOR

THE RESPECTIVE REPORTING UNITS TO APPROXIMATE WHAT THE PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO

WOULD BE AT A MORE NORMAL HISTORICAL CONTROL PREMIUM OF APPROXIMATELY 30

PERCENT FOR THE TOTAL COMPANY. EVEN AFTER INCLUDING THIS ADJUSTMENT TO THE

PRICE-EARNINGS RATIO, NO GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT WAS INDICATED FOR ANY OF THE

REPORTING UNITS. IN ADDITION, 3MS MARKET VALUE AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 OF

APPROXIMATELY $40 BILLION IS SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF ITS BOOK VALUE OF

APPROXIMATELY $10 BILLION. 3M WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR ITS REPORTING UNITS IN

2009 FOR ANY TRIGGERING EVENTS OR OTHER SIGNS OF IMPAIRMENT.

INCOME TAXES.

THE EXTENT OF 3MS

OPERATIONS INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN THE APPLICATION

OF COMPLEX TAX REGULATIONS IN A MULTITUDE OF JURISDICTIONS. THE FINAL TAXES

PAID ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS WITH TAXING

AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARISING FROM

FEDERAL, STATE, AND INTERNATIONAL TAX AUDITS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES POTENTIAL

LIABILITIES AND RECORDS TAX LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED TAX AUDIT ISSUES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS BASED ON ITS ESTIMATE OF WHETHER, AND

THE EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAXES WILL BE DUE. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007,

THE COMPANY FOLLOWS FIN 48 GUIDANCE TO RECORD THESE LIABILITIES (REFER TO NOTE

8 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION). THE COMPANY ADJUSTS THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF

CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES; HOWEVER, DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF SOME OF

THESE UNCERTAINTIES, THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION MAY RESULT IN A PAYMENT THAT IS

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE COMPANYS CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE TAX

LIABILITIES. IF THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF TAX LIABILITIES PROVES TO BE LESS

THAN THE ULTIMATE ASSESSMENT, AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO EXPENSE WOULD RESULT. IF

PAYMENT OF THESE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY PROVES TO BE LESS THAN THE RECORDED

AMOUNTS, THE REVERSAL OF THE LIABILITIES WOULD RESULT IN TAX BENEFITS BEING

RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE LIABILITIES ARE NO

LONGER NECESSARY.

FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

THE STRENGTH OF 3MS

CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND CONSISTENCY OF ITS CASH FLOWS PROVIDE 3M STABLE ACCESS TO

CAPITAL MARKETS IN THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES. DURING RECENT DISLOCATION IN THE

FINANCIAL MARKETS, 3M HAS HAD UNINTERRUPTED ACCESS TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER

MARKET. INTEREST RATES ON COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED BY THE COMPANY HAVE NOT BEEN

MATERIALLY NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE MARKET DIFFICULTIES. 3M BORROWED $850

MILLION VIA A LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUE IN AUGUST 2008 WITH A COUPON OF 4.375%.

3M ALSO RAISED $800 MILLION VIA A THREE-YEAR DEBT ISSUE IN OCTOBER 2008

WITH A COUPON OF 4.5%. DESPITE THE MARKET TURMOIL, 3M WAS ABLE TO SECURE

FUNDING TO ALLEVIATE CONCERNS ABOUT HAVING AMPLE LIQUIDITY TO MEET ITS

FORESEEABLE NEEDS. AS INDICATED IN THE TABLE BELOW, AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

3M HAD $2.6 BILLION OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND

$6.7 BILLION OF DEBT. DEBT IS COMPRISED OF $1.552 BILLION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT,

INCLUDING $575 MILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER, AND $5.166 BILLION OF LONG-TERM

DEBT. APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION OF THE LONG-TERM DEBT IS CLASSIFIED AS

CURRENT, INCLUDING $350 MILLION IN DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES, WHICH

ULTIMATELY MATURE IN DECEMBER 2010, AND A $62 MILLION FLOATING RATE NOTE,

WHICH HAS A PUT OPTION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS

LONG-TERM DEBT BALANCE DOES NOT MATURE UNTIL 2011 OR LATER. THUS, WHILE CREDIT

MARKETS REMAIN VOLATILE, 3MS CAPITAL STRUCTURE REMAINS VERY STRONG. 3M IS

COMMITTED TO MANAGING ITS CAPITAL STRUCTURE VERY CAREFULLY.

THE COMPANY

GENERATES SIGNIFICANT ONGOING CASH FLOW. INCREASES IN LONG-TERM DEBT HAVE BEEN

USED TO PARTIALLY FUND SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES AND ACQUISITIONS. ON APRIL 1,

2008, 3M (SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES BUSINESS) COMPLETED ITS

ACQUISITION OF 100 PERCENT OF THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF AEARO  A GLOBAL LEADER

IN THE PERSONAL PROTECTION

TIMING OF DEBT ISSUANCES. THE COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO MEET

CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED GROWTH PLANS, INCLUDING CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, WORKING

CAPITAL INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS.

THE COMPANY DOES NOT UTILIZE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

LINKED TO THE COMPANYS STOCK. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DOES HAVE CONTINGENTLY

CONVERTIBLE DEBT THAT, IF CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, IS CONVERTIBLE

INTO SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK (REFER TO NOTE 10 IN THIS DOCUMENT).

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY ARE STRONG. VARIOUS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING

CASH AND SHORT-TERM DEBT, CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MONTH TO MONTH

DEPENDING ON SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS. WORKING CAPITAL (DEFINED AS CURRENT

ASSETS MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES) TOTALED $3.759 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, COMPARED WITH $4.476 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. WORKING CAPITAL

DECREASES WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO DECLINES IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS,

SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, WHILE INCREASES IN

SHORT-TERM DEBT AND OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES ALSO DECREASED WORKING CAPITAL.

THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY WORKING CAPITAL INCREASES ATTRIBUTABLE TO

DECREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND ACCRUED INCOME TAXES, COMBINED WITH INCREASES

IN INVENTORY.

PRIMARY SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARE MET THROUGH

U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER AND EURO COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, OUTSTANDING TOTAL COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED TOTALED $575 MILLION AND

AVERAGED $1.106 BILLION DURING 2008. THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT UNLIKELY THAT ITS

ACCESS TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET WILL BE RESTRICTED.

IN JUNE 2007,

THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH UP TO $3

BILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MAY BE OFFERED, WITH REMAINING

SHELF BORROWING CAPACITY OF $850 MILLION

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 (SEE ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION IN FOLLOWING PARAGRAPH).

EFFECTIVE APRIL 30, 2007, THE COMPANY HAS A $1.5-BILLION FIVE-YEAR CREDIT

FACILITY, WHICH HAS PROVISIONS FOR THE COMPANY TO REQUEST AN INCREASE OF THE

FACILITY UP TO $2 BILLION (AT THE LENDERS DISCRETION), AND PROVIDING FOR UP TO

$150 MILLION IN LETTERS OF CREDIT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, AVAILABLE

SHORT-TERM COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT, INCLUDING THE PRECEDING $1.5 BILLION

FIVE-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY, TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1.582 BILLION, OF WHICH

APPROXIMATELY $143 MILLION WAS UTILIZED FOR LETTERS OF CREDIT IN CONNECTION

WITH NORMAL BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. DEBT COVENANTS DO NOT RESTRICT THE PAYMENT OF

DIVIDENDS.

THE COMPANY HAS A WELL-KNOWN

SEASONED ISSUER SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 24,

2006, WHICH REGISTERS AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES FOR

FUTURE SALES.

THE COMPANY INTENDS TO USE THE PROCEEDS FROM FUTURE

SECURITIES SALES OFF THIS SHELF FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SHELF

REGISTRATION, IN JUNE 2007 THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A MEDIUM-TERM NOTES

PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH UP TO $3 BILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MAY BE OFFERED. IN DECEMBER 2007,

3M ISSUED A FIVE-YEAR, $500 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE WITH A COUPON RATE OF

4.65% UNDER THIS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM. IN AUGUST 2008, 3M ISSUED A

FIVE-YEAR, $850 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE WITH A COUPON RATE OF 4.375% UNDER

THIS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM. IN OCTOBER 2008, THE COMPANY ISSUED A

THREE-YEAR $800 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE WITH A COUPON RATE OF 4.50%, UNDER

THIS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM, REDUCING REMAINING CAPACITY TO $850 MILLION AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO INCREASE THE AMOUNT

OF SECURITIES THAT ARE AUTHORIZED TO BE ISSUED UNDER THIS PROGRAM.

THE

COMPANY HAS AN AA CREDIT RATING, WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK, FROM STANDARD &

POORS AND AN AA1 CREDIT RATING, WITH A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK, FROM MOODYS

INVESTORS SERVICE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, CERTAIN DEBT AGREEMENTS ($350

MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES AND $44 MILLION OF ESOP DEBT)

HAD RATINGS TRIGGERS (BBB-/BAA3 OR LOWER) THAT WOULD REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF DEBT.

IN ADDITION, UNDER THE $1.5-BILLION FIVE-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, 3M IS

REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ITS EBITDA TO INTEREST RATIO AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL

QUARTER AT NOT LESS THAN 3.0 TO 1. THIS IS CALCULATED (AS DEFINED IN THE

AGREEMENT) AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL EBITDA FOR THE FOUR CONSECUTIVE

QUARTERS THEN ENDED TO TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE ON ALL FUNDED DEBT FOR THE SAME

PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THIS RATIO WAS APPROXIMATELY 30 TO 1.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

3MS CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 TOTALED $1.849 BILLION, WITH AN

ADDITIONAL $725 MILLION IN CURRENT AND LONG-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES. 3MS

STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH SIGNIFICANT

FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES GOING FORWARD. THE

COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ITS OPERATIONS TO DRIVE GROWTH, INCLUDING

CONTINUAL REVIEW OF ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES. 3M PAID DIVIDENDS OF $1.398

BILLION IN 2008, AND HAS A LONG HISTORY OF DIVIDEND INCREASES. IN FEBRUARY 2009,

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON 3M COMMON STOCK BY 2

PERCENT TO 51 CENTS PER SHARE, EQUIVALENT TO AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF $2.04 PER

SHARE. IN FEBRUARY 2007, 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A TWO-YEAR

SHARE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $7.0 BILLION FOR THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 12,

2007 TO FEBRUARY 28, 2009. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAS $2.6

BILLION REMAINING UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION. IN FEBRUARY 2009, 3MS BOARD

OF DIRECTORS EXTENDED THIS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION UNTIL THE REMAINING

$2.6 BILLION IS FULLY UTILIZED.

IN 2009, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE AN AMOUNT IN THE RANGE OF $600 MILLION TO $850

MILLION TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE

A REQUIRED MINIMUM PENSION CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2009.

THEREFORE, THE AMOUNT OF THE ANTICIPATED DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION COULD VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE U.S. QUALIFIED PLANS FUNDING STATUS AS OF THE

2009 MEASUREMENT DATE AND THE ANTICIPATED TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE

CONTRIBUTION. FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL ALSO DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS,

INTEREST RATES AND OTHER FACTORS. 3M BELIEVES ITS STRONG CASH FLOW AND BALANCE

SHEET WILL ALLOW IT TO FUND FUTURE PENSION NEEDS WITHOUT COMPROMISING GROWTH

OPPORTUNITIES.

THE COMPANY USES VARIOUS

WORKING CAPITAL MEASURES THAT PLACE EMPHASIS AND FOCUS ON CERTAIN WORKING

CAPITAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THESE MEASURES ARE NOT DEFINED UNDER U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND MAY NOT BE COMPUTED THE SAME AS

SIMILARLY TITLED MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. ONE OF THE PRIMARY WORKING

CAPITAL MEASURES 3M USES IS A COMBINED INDEX, WHICH INCLUDES ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. THIS COMBINED INDEX (DEFINED AS

QUARTERLY NET SALES  FOURTH QUARTER AT YEAR-END  MULTIPLIED BY FOUR, DIVIDED

BY ENDING NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PLUS INVENTORY LESS ACCOUNTS PAYABLE) WAS 4.5

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, DOWN FROM 5.3 AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. RECEIVABLES

DECREASED $167 MILLION, OR 5.0 PERCENT, COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31, 2007.

CURRENCY TRANSLATION DECREASED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BY $97 MILLION YEAR-ON-YEAR,

AS THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENED IN AGGREGATE AGAINST A MULTITUDE OF CURRENCIES.

INVENTORIES INCREASED $161 MILLION, OR 5.6 PERCENT, COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31,

2007. CURRENCY TRANSLATION DECREASED INVENTORIES BY $134 MILLION YEAR-ON-YEAR.

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE DECREASED $204 MILLION COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31,

2007. CURRENCY TRANSLATION DECREASED ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BY $35 MILLION

YEAR-ON-YEAR.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING

ACTIVITIES CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, AS PENSION

FUNDING DECISIONS, TAX TIMING DIFFERENCES AND OTHER ITEMS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACT CASH FLOWS. IN 2008, 2007 AND 2006, THE COMPANY MADE DISCRETIONARY

CONTRIBUTIONS OF $200 MILLION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN.

IN 2008, CASH

FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $258 MILLION. NET INCOME

DECREASED $636 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO GAINS FROM THE SALE OF BUSINESSES IN

2007 WHICH DID NOT REPEAT IN 2008. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE DECREASES BENEFITED CASH

FLOWS IN 2008, BUT INCREASES IN INVENTORIES AND DECREASES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE NEGATIVELY

IMPACTED CASH FLOWS. THE CATEGORY OTHER-NET IN THE PRECEDING TABLE REFLECTS

CHANGES IN OTHER ASSET AND LIABILITY ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING OUTSTANDING

LIABILITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 RELATED TO 3MS RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS

(NOTE 4).

IN 2007, CASH FLOWS

PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $436 MILLION, INCLUDING AN INCREASE

IN NET INCOME OF $245 MILLION. SINCE THE GAIN FROM SALE OF BUSINESSES IS

INCLUDED IN AND INCREASES NET INCOME, THE PRE-TAX GAIN FROM THE SALE OF THE

BUSINESSES MUST BE SUBTRACTED, AS SHOWN ABOVE, TO PROPERLY REFLECT OPERATING

CASH FLOWS. THE CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS ARE

SHOWN AS PART OF CASH FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, WHEN THE RELATED

TAXES ARE PAID THEY ARE REQUIRED TO BE SHOWN AS PART OF CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THUS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR 2007 WERE PENALIZED DUE TO

CASH INCOME TAX PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $630 MILLION IN 2007 THAT RELATED TO

THE SALE OF THE GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS. NON-PHARMACEUTICAL

RELATED CASH INCOME TAX PAYMENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $475 MILLION LOWER THAN

2006 DUE TO NORMAL TIMING DIFFERENCES IN TAX PAYMENTS, WHICH BENEFITED CASH

FLOWS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY INCREASES REDUCED CASH FLOWS IN 2007,

BUT DECREASED CASH FLOW LESS THAN IN 2006, RESULTING IN A YEAR-ON-YEAR BENEFIT

TO CASH FLOWS OF $323 MILLION. THE CATEGORY OTHER-NET IN THE PRECEDING TABLE

REFLECTS CHANGES IN OTHER ASSET AND LIABILITY ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF

CASH PAYMENTS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH 3MS RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS (NOTE 4).

INVESTMENTS IN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ENABLE

GROWTH IN DIVERSE MARKETS, HELPING TO MEET PRODUCT DEMAND AND INCREASING

MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY. IN 2008, MAJOR FACILITY EFFORTS INCLUDED COMPLETION

OF PRODUCTION LINES IN THE UNITED STATES FOR BOTH CONSUMER AND OFFICE AND

HEALTH CARE, AN R&D LABORATORY IN KOREA, A TAPE BUILDING IN POLAND, AND

NUMEROUS TAPE LINES AND BUILDING EXPANSIONS IN CHINA. IN 2008, 3M ALSO MADE

PROGRESS TOWARDS COMPLETION OF INVESTMENTS IN A SINGAPORE MULTI-PURPOSE

MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND FILM PRODUCTION FACILITIES AND MADE PROGRESS TOWARDS

COMPLETION OF MANUFACTURING COST REDUCTION INVESTMENTS IN TWO OF ITS U.S. FILM

MANUFACTURING PLANTS. FOR 2009, 3M HAS ALREADY CUT CAPITAL SPENDING PLANS MORE

THAN 30 PERCENT. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE 2009 EXPECTED SPENDING WILL BE

CARRYOVER FROM 2008 OR FOR TOOLING NEEDED FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND CONTINUED

OPERATIONS.

IN 2007, NUMEROUS PLANTS WERE OPENED OR EXPANDED

INTERNATIONALLY. THIS INCLUDED TWO FACILITIES IN KOREA (RESPIRATOR

MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND OPTICAL PLANT), INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES/TAPES

FACILITIES IN BOTH BRAZIL AND THE PHILIPPINES, A PLANT IN RUSSIA (CORROSION

PROTECTION, INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVE AND TAPES, AND RESPIRATORS), A PLANT IN CHINA

(OPTICAL SYSTEMS, INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES AND TAPES, AND PERSONAL CARE), AN

EXPANSION IN CANADA (CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT BUSINESS), IN ADDITION

TO INVESTMENTS IN INDIA, MEXICO AND OTHER COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, 3M EXPANDED MANUFACTURING

CAPABILITIES IN THE U.S., INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES/TAPES

AND OPTICAL. AS A RESULT OF THIS INCREASED ACTIVITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE

$1.422 BILLION IN 2007, AN INCREASE OF $254 MILLION WHEN COMPARED TO 2006.

REFER TO NOTE 2 FOR

INFORMATION ON 2008, 2007 AND 2006 ACQUISITIONS. NOTE 2 ALSO PROVIDES

INFORMATION ON THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF BUSINESSES. THE COMPANY IS

ACTIVELY CONSIDERING ADDITIONAL ACQUISITIONS, INVESTMENTS AND STRATEGIC

ALLIANCES, AND FROM TIME TO TIME MAY ALSO DIVEST CERTAIN BUSINESSES.

PURCHASES

OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS AND PROCEEDS FROM SALE (OR MATURITIES)

OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, AGENCY

SECURITIES, CORPORATE MEDIUM-TERM NOTE SECURITIES AND OTHER SECURITIES, WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE.

INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK RELATED TO THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL MAY

IMPACT THE VALUE OF INVESTMENTS IN ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES, WHILE FACTORS SUCH

AS GENERAL CONDITIONS IN THE OVERALL CREDIT MARKET AND THE NATURE OF THE

UNDERLYING COLLATERAL MAY AFFECT THE LIQUIDITY OF INVESTMENTS IN

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES. THE COUPON INTEREST RATES FOR ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES ARE EITHER

FIXED RATE OR FLOATING. FLOATING RATE COUPONS RESET MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY

BASED UPON THE CORRESPONDING MONTHLY OR QUARTERLY LIBOR RATE. EACH INDIVIDUAL

FLOATING RATE SECURITY HAS A COUPON BASED UPON THE RESPECTIVE LIBOR RATE +/- AN

AMOUNT REFLECTIVE OF THE CREDIT RISK OF THE ISSUER AND THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL ON THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE. TERMS OF THE RESET ARE UNIQUE TO

INDIVIDUAL SECURITIES. FIXED RATE COUPONS ARE ESTABLISHED AT THE TIME THE

SECURITY IS ISSUED AND ARE BASED UPON A SPREAD TO A RELATED MATURITY TREASURY

BOND. THE SPREAD AGAINST THE TREASURY BOND IS REFLECTIVE OF THE CREDIT

RISK OF THE ISSUER AND THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL ON THE ORIGINAL ISSUE DATE. 3M

DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT RISK RELATED TO ITS HOLDINGS IN ASSET-BACKED

SECURITIES TO MATERIALLY IMPACT ITS FINANCIAL CONDITION OR LIQUIDITY. REFER TO

NOTE 9 FOR MORE DETAILS ABOUT 3MS

DIVERSIFIED MARKETABLE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO, WHICH

TOTALED $725 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. PROCEEDS FROM SALES OR

MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES, NET OF PURCHASES, TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $282

MILLION IN 2008. PURCHASES OF

MARKETABLE SECURITIES, NET OF SALES AND MATURITIES, TOTALED $429 MILLION IN

2007 AND $637 MILLION IN 2006. IN 2005, 3M PURCHASED 19 PERCENT OF

TI&M BETEILIGUNGSGESELLSCHAFT MBH FOR APPROXIMATELY $55 MILLION. IN 2007,

THE RECOVERY OF APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION REDUCED INVESTMENTS AND IS SHOWN IN

CASH FLOWS WITHIN PROCEEDS FROM SALE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND INVESTMENTS.

THIS INVESTMENT IS DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL UNDER THE PRECEDING SECTION

TOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, WAS $6.718 BILLION, UP FROM $4.920 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2007. TOTAL DEBT

WAS 40 PERCENT OF TOTAL CAPITAL (TOTAL CAPITAL IS DEFINED AS DEBT PLUS EQUITY),

COMPARED WITH 30 PERCENT AT YEAR-END 2007. THE NET CHANGE IN SHORT-TERM DEBT IS

PRIMARILY DUE TO COMMERCIAL PAPER ACTIVITY. IN 2008, THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT FOR

MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS PRIMARILY REPRESENTS DEBT ACQUIRED UPON THE

ACQUISITION OF AEARO THAT WAS IMMEDIATELY REPAID AND REPAYMENT OF COMMERCIAL

PAPER WITH MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS. PROCEEDS FROM DEBT PRIMARILY

INCLUDE A FIVE-YEAR, $850 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE ISSUED IN AUGUST 2008

WITH A COUPON RATE OF 4.375%, AND A THREE-YEAR, $800 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE

ISSUED IN OCTOBER 2008 WITH A COUPON RATE OF 4.5% (REFER TO NOTE 10 FOR

MORE INFORMATION).

TOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER 31,

2007, WAS $4.920 BILLION, UP FROM $3.553 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2006. THE NET

CHANGE IN SHORT-TERM DEBT IS PRIMARILY DUE TO COMMERCIAL PAPER ACTIVITY. IN

2007, THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT FOR MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS IS PRIMARILY

COMPRISED OF COMMERCIAL PAPER REPAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.15 BILLION AND THE

NOVEMBER 2007 REDEMPTION OF APPROXIMATELY $322 MILLION IN CONVERTIBLE

NOTES. IN 2007, PROCEEDS FROM DEBT INCLUDED LONG-TERM DEBT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER

ISSUANCES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION. THIS WAS COMPRISED OF EUROBOND

ISSUANCES IN DECEMBER 2007 AND JULY 2007 TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $1.5

BILLION IN U.S. DOLLARS, A MARCH 2007 LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCE OF $750

MILLION AND A DECEMBER 2007 FIXED RATE NOTE ISSUANCE OF $500 MILLION, PLUS

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES (MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS) OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.25 BILLION. INCREASES IN LONG-TERM DEBT WERE USED, IN PART, TO FUND SHARE

REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES.

REPURCHASES OF COMMON

STOCK ARE MADE TO SUPPORT THE COMPANYS STOCK-BASED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION PLANS

AND FOR OTHER CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN FEBRUARY 2007, 3MS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED A TWO-YEAR SHARE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $7.0 BILLION FOR THE

PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 12, 2007 TO FEBRUARY 28, 2009. IN 2008, THE

COMPANY PURCHASED $1.6 BILLION IN SHARES. IN 2007, THE COMPANY ACCELERATED

PURCHASES OF TREASURY STOCK WHEN COMPARED TO PRIOR YEARS, BUYING BACK $3.2

BILLION IN SHARES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, APPROXIMATELY $2.6 BILLION

REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE. IN FEBRUARY 2009, 3MS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS EXTENDED THIS SHARE REPURCHASE AUTHORIZATION UNTIL THE REMAINING $2.6

BILLION IS FULLY UTILIZED. FOR MORE INFORMATION, REFER TO THE TABLE TITLED ISSUER

PURCHASES OF EQUITY SECURITIES IN PART II, ITEM 5.

CASH DIVIDENDS PAID TO

STOCKHOLDERS TOTALED $1.398 BILLION ($2.00 PER SHARE) IN 2008, $1.380 BILLION

($1.92 PER SHARE) IN 2007 AND $1.376 BILLION ($1.84 PER SHARE) IN 2006. 3M HAS

PAID DIVIDENDS SINCE 1916. IN FEBRUARY 2009, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS

INCREASED THE QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON 3M COMMON STOCK BY 2.0 PERCENT TO 51 CENTS

PER SHARE, EQUIVALENT TO AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF $2.04 PER SHARE. THIS MARKED THE

51ST CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF DIVIDEND INCREASES. OTHER CASH FLOWS FROM FINANCING

ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE DISTRIBUTIONS TO MINORITY INTERESTS, EXCESS TAX

BENEFITS FROM STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, CHANGES IN CASH OVERDRAFT BALANCES, AND

PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS FOR CAPITAL LEASES.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAS NOT

UTILIZED SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES TO FACILITATE OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING

ARRANGEMENTS. REFER TO THE SECTION ENTITLED WARRANTIES/GUARANTEES IN NOTE 14

FOR DISCUSSION OF ACCRUED PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND GUARANTEES.

IN ADDITION TO

GUARANTEES, 3M, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, PERIODICALLY ENTERS INTO

AGREEMENTS THAT REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INDEMNIFY EITHER MAJOR CUSTOMERS OR

SUPPLIERS FOR SPECIFIC RISKS, SUCH AS CLAIMS FOR INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE

ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF 3M PRODUCTS OR THE NEGLIGENCE OF 3M PERSONNEL, OR

CLAIMS ALLEGING THAT 3M PRODUCTS INFRINGE THIRD-PARTY PATENTS OR OTHER

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. WHILE 3MS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION

PROVISIONS CANNOT BE ESTIMATED, THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE

A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

DUE IN 2009 INCLUDE $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES (FINAL

MATURITY 2010) AND $62 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE NOTES (FINAL MATURITY 2044).

THESE SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS THE

RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. LONG-TERM DEBT

PAYMENTS DUE IN 2010 AND 2011 INCLUDE FLOATING RATE NOTES TOTALING $85 MILLION

AND $100 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS A RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS. ADDITIONALLY, PAYMENTS

DUE IN 2012 INCLUDE THE $224 MILLION CARRYING AMOUNT OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES, AS A

RESULT OF THE PUT PROVISION.

UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS ARE DEFINED AS AN AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES THAT IS

ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING ON THE COMPANY. INCLUDED IN THE UNCONDITIONAL

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS CATEGORY ABOVE ARE CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO TAKE OR

PAY CONTRACTS, CAPITAL COMMITMENTS, SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND UTILITIES. THESE

ESTIMATES INCLUDE BOTH UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH TERMS IN EXCESS

OF ONE YEAR AND NORMAL ONGOING PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH TERMS OF LESS THAN ONE

YEAR. MANY OF THESE COMMITMENTS RELATE TO TAKE OR PAY CONTRACTS, IN WHICH 3M

GUARANTEES PAYMENT TO ENSURE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT ARE SOLD

TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE CONSIDERATION (PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES) FOR THESE UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS. CONTRACTUAL CAPITAL

COMMITMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE, BUT THESE COMMITMENTS

REPRESENT A SMALL PART OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED CAPITAL SPENDING IN 2009 AND

BEYOND. THE PURCHASE OBLIGATION AMOUNTS DO NOT REPRESENT THE ENTIRE ANTICIPATED

PURCHASES IN THE FUTURE, BUT REPRESENT ONLY THOSE ITEMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY

IS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED. THE MAJORITY OF 3MS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE

PURCHASED AS NEEDED, WITH NO UNCONDITIONAL COMMITMENT. FOR THIS REASON, THESE

AMOUNTS WILL NOT PROVIDE A RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED FUTURE

CASH OUTFLOWS ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS.

OTHER OBLIGATIONS,

INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WITHIN THE CAPTION ENTITLED UNCONDITIONAL

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER, INCLUDE THE CURRENT PORTION OF THE LIABILITY

FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS UNDER FIN 48. THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY

ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF THE LONG-TERM PAYMENTS OR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE

LIABILITY WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE OVER TIME; THEREFORE, THE LONG-TERM PORTION

OF THE NET TAX LIABILITY OF $314 MILLION IS EXCLUDED FROM THE PRECEDING TABLE.

REFER TO NOTE 8 FOR FURTHER DETAILS.

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11,

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED MINIMUM PENSION CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION

FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2009 AND COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS U.S. AND

INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LARGELY DISCRETIONARY IN 2009

AND FUTURE YEARS; THEREFORE, AMOUNTS RELATED TO THESE PLANS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN

THE PRECEDING TABLE.

FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS

INTO CONTRACTUAL DERIVATIVE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO

MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE, INTEREST RATE RISKS AND COMMODITY PRICE

RISKS. A FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE, COMPOSED OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT,

PROVIDES OVERSIGHT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT AND DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES. THIS

COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RISK POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES, AND

PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT UTILIZATION. THIS COMMITTEE ALSO

ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES FOR CONTROL AND VALUATION, RISK ANALYSIS, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT

APPROVAL, AND ONGOING MONITORING AND REPORTING.

THE COMPANY ENTERS

INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAPS TO HEDGE AGAINST THE

EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY MANAGES

INTEREST RATE RISKS USING A MIX OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATE DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE

BORROWING COSTS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS. UNDER THESE

ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY AGREES TO EXCHANGE, AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND FLOATING INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE

TO AN AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT. THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY

PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS

AND FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO TEST THE COMPANYS

EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES AND ASSESS THE RISK OF LOSS

OR BENEFIT IN AFTER-TAX EARNINGS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVES AND UNDERLYING

EXPOSURES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE MODEL (THIRD-PARTY BANK

DATASET) USED A 95 PERCENT CONFIDENCE LEVEL OVER A 12-MONTH TIME HORIZON. THE

MODEL USED ANALYZED 17 CURRENCIES, INTEREST RATES RELATED TO THREE CURRENCIES,

AND FIVE COMMODITIES, BUT DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT WHAT ACTUALLY WILL BE

EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY. THIS MODEL DOES NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN HEDGE

TRANSACTIONS, BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THEIR INCLUSION WOULD NOT MATERIALLY

IMPACT THE RESULTS. FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE RISK OF LOSS OR BENEFIT INCREASED

SUBSTANTIALLY IN 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN VOLATILITY DURING 2008,

WHICH IS ONE OF THE KEY DRIVERS IN THE VALUATION MODEL. THE DECLINE IN INTEREST

RATE RISK OF LOSS OR BENEFIT DURING 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN

INTEREST RATES. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE POSSIBLE ADVERSE AND

POSITIVE IMPACTS TO AFTER-TAX EARNINGS RELATED TO THESE EXPOSURES.

THE GLOBAL EXPOSURES RELATED TO PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND

MATERIALS ARE SUCH THAT A 1 PERCENT PRICE CHANGE WOULD RESULT IN A PRE-TAX COST

OR SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $63 MILLION PER YEAR. THE GLOBAL ENERGY EXPOSURE IS

SUCH THAT A 10 PERCENT PRICE CHANGE WOULD RESULT IN A PRE-TAX COST OR SAVINGS

OF APPROXIMATELY $42 MILLION PER YEAR. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE USED TO HEDGE

APPROXIMATELY 1 PERCENT OF THE PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS EXPOSURE AND

ARE USED TO HEDGE APPROXIMATELY 10 PERCENT OF THIS ENERGY EXPOSURE.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

IN THE CONTEXT OF ITEM 7A, MARKET RISK REFERS TO THE RISK

OF LOSS ARISING FROM ADVERSE CHANGES IN FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT

MARKET RATES AND PRICES, SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE COMPANY DISCUSSES RISK MANAGEMENT IN VARIOUS

PLACES THROUGHOUT THIS DOCUMENT, INCLUDING DISCUSSIONS IN ITEM 7 CONCERNING

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY, AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND IN THE NOTES

TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS,

DERIVATIVES, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, AND THE DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES ACCOUNTING POLICY). ALL DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY IS GOVERNED BY WRITTEN

POLICIES, AND A VALUE-AT-RISK ANALYSIS IS PROVIDED FOR THESE DERIVATIVES. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE LEVERAGED DERIVATIVE POSITIONS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DOES

HAVE CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT THAT, IF CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET,

IS CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK (REFER TO NOTE 10 IN THIS

DOCUMENT).

MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR

FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INTEGRITY AND

OBJECTIVITY OF THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT. THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WHERE NECESSARY, THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT ESTIMATES BASED ON MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT.

MANAGEMENT HAS ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF

INTERNAL ACCOUNTING AND OTHER CONTROLS FOR THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

THIS SYSTEM AND ITS ESTABLISHED ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES AND RELATED CONTROLS ARE

DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT ASSETS ARE SAFEGUARDED, THAT THE

BOOKS AND RECORDS PROPERLY REFLECT ALL TRANSACTIONS, THAT POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES ARE IMPLEMENTED BY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, AND THAT PUBLISHED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE PROPERLY PREPARED AND FAIRLY PRESENTED. THE COMPANYS SYSTEM OF

INTERNAL CONTROL IS SUPPORTED BY WIDELY COMMUNICATED WRITTEN POLICIES,

INCLUDING BUSINESS CONDUCT POLICIES, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO REQUIRE ALL

EMPLOYEES TO MAINTAIN HIGH ETHICAL STANDARDS IN THE CONDUCT OF COMPANY AFFAIRS.

INTERNAL AUDITORS CONTINUALLY REVIEW THE ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL SYSTEM.

3M COMPANY

MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND

MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.

BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE.

MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008 EXCLUDED AEARO, WHICH WAS ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY IN APRIL 2008 IN A

PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION. AEARO IS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE

COMPANY WHOSE TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL NET SALES REPRESENTED LESS THAN 10% OF

CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS AND LESS THAN 2% OF CONSOLIDATED NET SALES,

RESPECTIVELY, OF THE COMPANY AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2008. COMPANIES ARE ALLOWED TO EXCLUDE ACQUISITIONS FROM THEIR ASSESSMENT OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE FIRST YEAR OF AN

ACQUISITION WHILE INTEGRATING THE ACQUIRED COMPANY UNDER GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED

BY THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION.

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 HAS BEEN AUDITED

BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING

FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN, WHICH EXPRESSES AN

UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORT OF

INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO

THE STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 3M COMPANY.

IN

OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS LISTED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

INDEX PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION

OF 3M COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT DECEMBER 31, 2008

AND 2007, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF

THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 IN CONFORMITY WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, BASED

ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL -

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED

AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE

THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING,

ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT

ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT

PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED

OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING

THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE

ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE

CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY

CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER

POST-RETIREMENT PLANS IN 2006 AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS FOR UNCERTAIN

TAX POSITIONS IN 2007.

A

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING

AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE

WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN

TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE

BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING

PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION

OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

AS

DESCRIBED IN MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

IN THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX, MANAGEMENT HAS EXCLUDED AEARO FROM ITS ASSESSMENT OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 BECAUSE

IT WAS ACQUIRED BY THE COMPANY IN A PURCHASE BUSINESS COMBINATION DURING 2008.

WE HAVE ALSO EXCLUDED AEARO FROM OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING. AEARO IS A WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY WHOSE TOTAL ASSETS

AND TOTAL NET SALES REPRESENT LESS THAN 10% AND LESS THAN 2%, RESPECTIVELY, OF

THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENT AMOUNTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008.

BECAUSE

OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT

PREVENT OR DETECT MISSTATEMENTS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF

EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT CONTROLS MAY

BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF

COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE

1.  SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONSOLIDATION.

3M IS A DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL MANUFACTURER,

TECHNOLOGY INNOVATOR AND MARKETER OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS. ALL

SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY

TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERM 3M OR COMPANY REFERS

TO 3M COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE.

FOREIGN

CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

LOCAL CURRENCIES GENERALLY ARE CONSIDERED THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES FOR OPERATIONS IN

LOCAL-CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS ARE TRANSLATED AT YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES. INCOME

AND EXPENSE ITEMS ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING

THE YEAR. CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

RECLASSIFICATIONS.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN THE PRIOR YEARS

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE

CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

USE OF

ESTIMATES.

THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE

OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS,

AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD.

ACTUAL RESULTS COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

CASH AND

CASH EQUIVALENTS.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF CASH AND TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS WITH

MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS WHEN PURCHASED.

INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE THE CASH

SURRENDER VALUE OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES, EQUITY AND COST METHOD INVESTMENTS,

AND REAL ESTATE NOT USED IN THE BUSINESS. INVESTMENTS IN LIFE INSURANCE ARE

REPORTED AT THE AMOUNT THAT COULD BE REALIZED UNDER CONTRACT AT THE BALANCE

SHEET DATE, WITH ANY CHANGES IN CASH SURRENDER VALUE OR CONTRACT VALUE DURING

THE PERIOD ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN ADJUSTMENT OF PREMIUMS PAID. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO

INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

INVENTORIES.

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF

COST OR MARKET, WITH COST GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING

CAPITALIZED INTEREST AND INTERNAL ENGINEERING COSTS, ARE RECORDED AT COST.

DEPRECIATION OF PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT GENERALLY IS COMPUTED USING THE

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD BASED ON THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS PRIMARILY RANGE FROM 10 TO

40 YEARS, WITH THE MAJORITY IN THE RANGE OF 20 TO 40 YEARS. THE ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT PRIMARILY RANGE FROM THREE TO 15 YEARS,

WITH THE MAJORITY IN THE RANGE OF FIVE TO 10 YEARS. FULLY DEPRECIATED ASSETS

ARE RETAINED IN PROPERTY AND ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTS UNTIL DISPOSAL.

UPON DISPOSAL, ASSETS AND RELATED ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE

ACCOUNTS AND THE NET AMOUNT, LESS PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSAL, IS CHARGED OR

CREDITED TO OPERATIONS. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AMOUNTS ARE REVIEWED FOR

IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET (ASSET GROUP) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN IMPAIRMENT

LOSS WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE

ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE

ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE

RECORDED IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUE OVER ITS

FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

ANALYSIS.

CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

UNDER FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. 47, ACCOUNTING FOR

CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FIN 47), A LIABILITY IS INITIALLY

RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE

RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT IS INCURRED

IF A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE CAN BE MADE. CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS EXIST FOR CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM ASSETS. THE

OBLIGATION IS INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE USING EXPECTED PRESENT VALUE

TECHNIQUES. OVER TIME THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THEIR

PRESENT VALUE AND THE INITIAL CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE USEFUL

LIVES OF THE RELATED ASSETS. FIN 47, WAS EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND

ITS ADOPTION RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION

LIABILITY OF $59 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, AND AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF

$35 MILLION FOR 2005, WHICH WAS REFLECTED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. THE ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATION LIABILITY WAS $62 MILLION AND $59 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007.

GOODWILL.

GOODWILL IS THE EXCESS OF COST OF AN ACQUIRED ENTITY OVER

THE AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A BUSINESS

COMBINATION. GOODWILL IS NOT AMORTIZED. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT

ANNUALLY, AND WILL BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT

OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY BE

IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR GOODWILL IS DONE AT A REPORTING UNIT LEVEL,

WITH ALL GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO A

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REPORTING UNIT. REPORTING UNITS ARE ONE LEVEL BELOW THE

BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL, BUT CAN BE COMBINED WHEN REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE

SAME SEGMENT HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS

GENERALLY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNITS

NET ASSETS EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED USING EARNINGS FOR THE

REPORTING UNIT MULTIPLIED BY A PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO FOR COMPARABLE INDUSTRY

GROUPS, OR BY USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. THE PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO

IS ADJUSTED DOWNWARD, IF NECESSARY, TO TAKE INTO CONSIDERATION THE MARKET VALUE

OF THE COMPANY.

INTANGIBLE

ASSETS.

INTANGIBLE

ASSETS INCLUDE PATENTS, TRADENAMES AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM AN

INDEPENDENT PARTY. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE, NAMELY CERTAIN

TRADENAMES, ARE NOT AMORTIZED. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE ARE

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, WITH ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM

ONE TO 20 YEARS. INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT

ANNUALLY, AND WILL BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT

OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY

BE IMPAIRED. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT

WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET

(ASSET GROUP) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS USED

IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS

TO BE RECORDED IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUE OVER

ITS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

ANALYSIS. COSTS RELATED TO INTERNALLY DEVELOPED INTANGIBLE ASSETS, SUCH AS

PATENTS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED, PRIMARILY IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND

RELATED EXPENSES.

REVENUE

(SALES) RECOGNITION.

THE COMPANY SELLS A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSIFIED BASE OF CUSTOMERS

AROUND THE WORLD AND HAS NO MATERIAL CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. REVENUE IS

RECOGNIZED WHEN THE RISKS AND REWARDS OF

OWNERSHIP HAVE SUBSTANTIVELY TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS. THIS CONDITION NORMALLY

IS MET WHEN THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN DELIVERED OR UPON PERFORMANCE OF SERVICES. THE

COMPANY RECORDS ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE OR RECORDS EXPENSE FOR CUSTOMER

AND DISTRIBUTOR INCENTIVES, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF REBATES AND FREE GOODS, AT

THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THESE SALES INCENTIVES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR IN

ACCORDANCE WITH EITF ISSUE NO. 01-9, ACCOUNTING FOR CONSIDERATION GIVEN

BY A VENDOR TO A CUSTOMER (INCLUDING A RESELLER OF THE VENDORS PRODUCTS). THE

ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR REBATES ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS,

HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TREND ANALYSIS AND PROJECTED MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE

VARIOUS MARKETS SERVED. SINCE THE COMPANY SERVES NUMEROUS MARKETS, THE REBATE

PROGRAMS OFFERED VARY ACROSS BUSINESSES, BUT THE MOST COMMON INCENTIVE RELATES

TO AMOUNTS PAID OR CREDITED TO CUSTOMERS FOR ACHIEVING DEFINED VOLUME LEVELS OR

GROWTH OBJECTIVES. FREE GOODS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN EXPENSE AND RECORDED IN

COST OF SALES. SALES, USE, VALUE-ADDED AND OTHER EXCISE TAXES ARE NOT

RECOGNIZED IN REVENUE.

THE MAJORITY OF 3MS

SALES AGREEMENTS ARE FOR STANDARD PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WITH CUSTOMER

ACCEPTANCE OCCURRING UPON DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCT OR PERFORMANCE OF THE

SERVICE. 3M ALSO ENTERS INTO AGREEMENTS THAT CONTAIN MULTIPLE ELEMENTS (SUCH AS

EQUIPMENT, INSTALLATION AND SERVICE) OR NON-STANDARD TERMS AND CONDITIONS. FOR

MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, 3M RECOGNIZES REVENUE FOR DELIVERED ELEMENTS

WHEN IT HAS STAND-ALONE VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER, THE FAIR VALUES OF UNDELIVERED

ELEMENTS ARE KNOWN, CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF THE DELIVERED ELEMENTS HAS OCCURRED,

AND THERE ARE ONLY CUSTOMARY REFUND OR RETURN RIGHTS RELATED TO THE DELIVERED

ELEMENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE PRECEDING CONDITIONS, EQUIPMENT REVENUE IS NOT

RECORDED UNTIL THE INSTALLATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED IF EQUIPMENT ACCEPTANCE IS

DEPENDENT UPON INSTALLATION, OR IF INSTALLATION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE

FUNCTIONALITY OF THE EQUIPMENT. INSTALLATION REVENUES ARE NOT RECORDED UNTIL

INSTALLATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED. FOR PREPAID SERVICE CONTRACTS, SALES REVENUE

IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT, UNLESS

HISTORICAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THE COSTS ARE INCURRED ON OTHER THAN A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. LICENSE FEE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EARNED, AND NO

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED UNTIL THE INCEPTION OF THE LICENSE TERM. ON OCCASION,

AGREEMENTS WILL CONTAIN MILESTONES, OR 3M WILL RECOGNIZE REVENUE BASED ON

PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE. FOR THESE AGREEMENTS, AND DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFICS,

3M MAY RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON COMPLETION OF A SUBSTANTIVE MILESTONE, OR IN PROPORTION

TO COSTS INCURRED TO DATE COMPARED WITH THE ESTIMATE OF TOTAL COSTS TO BE

INCURRED.

ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCES.

TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE RECORDED AT THE INVOICED

AMOUNT AND DO NOT BEAR INTEREST. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ALLOWANCES FOR BAD

DEBTS, CASH DISCOUNTS, PRODUCT RETURNS AND VARIOUS OTHER ITEMS. THE ALLOWANCE

FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND PRODUCT RETURNS IS BASED ON THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE

AMOUNT OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES IN EXISTING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND

ANTICIPATED SALES RETURNS. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ALLOWANCES BASED ON

HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE BY INDUSTRY AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC DATA AND

HISTORICAL SALES RETURNS. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL

ACCOUNTS MONTHLY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

ADVERTISING

AND MERCHANDISING.

THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS IN THE YEAR INCURRED, AND TOTALED $468

MILLION IN 2008, $469 MILLION IN 2007 AND $471 MILLION IN 2006.

RESEARCH,

DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO OPERATIONS IN THE YEAR

INCURRED AND ARE SHOWN ON A SEPARATE LINE OF THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES TOTALED $1.404 BILLION IN

2008, $1.368 BILLION IN 2007 AND $1.522 BILLION IN 2006. IN 2006, THIS INCLUDED

A $95 MILLION IN-PROCESS RESEARCH

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND DEVELOPMENT

CHARGE (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2) AND $75 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS (NOTE 4).

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, COVERING BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND THE

APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND IMPROVED

PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, TOTALED $851 MILLION IN 2008, $788 MILLION IN 2007,

AND $943 MILLION IN 2006. RELATED EXPENSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TECHNICAL SUPPORT

PROVIDED BY 3M TO CUSTOMERS WHO ARE USING EXISTING 3M PRODUCTS, AND INTERNALLY

DEVELOPED PATENT COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE COSTS AND FEES INCURRED TO PREPARE, FILE,

SECURE AND MAINTAIN PATENTS.

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE.

THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES DIRECT COSTS OF

MATERIALS AND SERVICES USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE.

AMOUNTS CAPITALIZED ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A PERIOD OF

THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT

WITHIN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

ENVIRONMENTAL.

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXISTING

CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR

FUTURE REVENUES ARE EXPENSED. RESERVES FOR LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED

REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE

AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY

STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION. ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE

OPERATIONS GENERALLY ARE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES.

INCOME TAXES.

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS

DETERMINED USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY APPROACH. UNDER THIS APPROACH,

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES REPRESENT THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE ITS DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS WHEN UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THEIR RELIABILITY EXISTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, NO SIGNIFICANT VALUATION ALLOWANCES WERE RECORDED. AS OF JANUARY 1,

2007, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48 (FIN 48), ACCOUNTING

FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES, AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109.

3M FOLLOWS FIN 48 GUIDANCE TO RECORD UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN THE

APPLICATION OF COMPLEX TAX REGULATIONS IN A MULTITUDE OF JURISDICTIONS (REFER TO

NOTE 8 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION).

EARNINGS PER SHARE.

THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING

FOR CALCULATING BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

DILUTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. CERTAIN

MANAGEMENT STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM AVERAGE OPTIONS OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEARS

2008, 2007 AND 2006 WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS

PER SHARE BECAUSE THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A DILUTIVE EFFECT (41.0 MILLION

AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR 2008, 21.6 MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR 2007, AND 31.5

MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR 2006). AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 10, THE CONDITIONS FOR

CONVERSION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES HAVE NEVER BEEN MET. IF

THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, 3M MAY CHOOSE TO PAY IN CASH AND/OR

COMMON STOCK; HOWEVER, IF THIS OCCURS, THE COMPANY HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY

TO SETTLE THIS DEBT SECURITY IN CASH. ACCORDINGLY, THERE WAS NO IMPACT ON 3MS

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE. THE

COMPUTATIONS FOR BASIC AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT, AND RELATED INTERPRETATIONS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION IS DETERMINED AT THE GRANT DATE AND THE RECOGNITION OF

THE RELATED EXPENSE IS RECORDED OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION VESTS. THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123R EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2006, USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE METHOD. ALL PRIOR PERIODS WERE RESTATED

TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE FAIR-VALUE-BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR AWARDS GRANTED

IN FISCAL YEARS

BEGINNING ON OR

METHOD TO CALCULATE THE HISTORICAL POOL OF WINDFALL TAX BENEFITS UPON ADOPTION

OF SFAS NO. 123R. REFER TO NOTE 16 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME.

TOTAL

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND THE COMPONENTS OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (LOSS) ARE PRESENTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (LOSS) IS COMPOSED OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EFFECTS (INCLUDING

HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES), DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION

AND POSTRETIREMENT PLAN ADJUSTMENTS, UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES

ON CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES.

ALL

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, ARE RECORDED ON THE BALANCE

SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY AND

COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO

MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, INTEREST RATE AND

COMMODITY MARKET VOLATILITY. ALL HEDGING INSTRUMENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE

ACCOUNTING ARE DESIGNATED AND EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S.

GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. IF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION

CEASES TO EXIST, ALL CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVES THAT HAVE

NOT BEEN SETTLED ARE RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. INSTRUMENTS THAT DO NOT

QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH CHANGES RECOGNIZED IN

CURRENT EARNINGS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES AND IS NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES.

HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DOES HAVE CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE DEBT THAT, IF

CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, IS CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF 3M COMMON

STOCK (REFER TO NOTE 10 IN THIS DOCUMENT).

NEW

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JUNE 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 48 (FIN 48), ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY

IN INCOME TAXES, AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109.  FIN 48 WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1,

2007. REFER TO NOTE 8 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS STANDARD.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. SFAS NO. 157 ESTABLISHES A SINGLE DEFINITION OF

FAIR VALUE AND A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE, SETS OUT A FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY TO BE USED TO CLASSIFY THE SOURCE OF INFORMATION USED IN FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS, AND REQUIRES NEW DISCLOSURES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED

AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON THEIR LEVEL IN THE HIERARCHY. THIS STATEMENT APPLIES

UNDER OTHER ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS THAT REQUIRE OR PERMIT FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED STAFF POSITIONS (FSPS) NO. 157-1

AND NO. 157-2, WHICH, RESPECTIVELY, REMOVE LEASING TRANSACTIONS FROM THE

SCOPE OF SFAS NO. 157 AND DEFER ITS EFFECTIVE DATE FOR ONE YEAR RELATIVE

TO CERTAIN NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, THE APPLICATION OF

THE DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE AND RELATED DISCLOSURES OF SFAS NO. 157 (AS

IMPACTED BY THESE TWO FSPS) WAS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2008

ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS WITH RESPECT TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF (A) NONFINANCIAL

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY) AND (B) ALL

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THIS ADOPTION DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE

REMAINING ASPECTS OF SFAS NO. 157 FOR WHICH THE EFFECTIVE DATE WAS

DEFERRED UNDER FSP NO. 157-2 HAVE BEEN EVALUATED BY THE COMPANY. AREAS

IMPACTED BY THE DEFERRAL RELATE TO NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE

MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, BUT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

NONRECURRING BASIS. THIS DEFERRAL APPLIES TO SUCH ITEMS AS NONFINANCIAL ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION (BUT

NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS) OR NONFINANCIAL LONG-LIVED

ASSET GROUPS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE FOR AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT. THE EFFECTS

OF THESE REMAINING ASPECTS OF SFAS NO. 157 ARE TO BE APPLIED BY 3M TO FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS PROSPECTIVELY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT EXPECT THEM TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. REFER TO NOTE 13 FOR DISCLOSURES REQUIRED BY

THIS NEW PRONOUNCEMENT.

IN EARLY OCTOBER 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP NO. 157-3,

DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET WHEN THE MARKET FOR THAT ASSET

IS NOT ACTIVE, WHICH AMENDED SFAS NO. 157 TO ILLUSTRATE KEY CONSIDERATIONS

IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET IN AN INACTIVE MARKET. THIS

FSP WAS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M BEGINNING WITH THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

2008. ITS ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE WAS INCORPORATED IN THE MEASUREMENTS OF FAIR

VALUE OF APPLICABLE FINANCIAL ASSETS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 13 AND DID NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87,

88, 106 AND 132(R). REFER TO NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING

THIS STANDARD.

IN FEBRUARY 2007,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS

AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES. SFAS NO. 159 PERMITS AN ENTITY TO CHOOSE, AT

SPECIFIED ELECTION DATES, TO MEASURE ELIGIBLE FINANCIAL

50

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN

OTHER ITEMS AT FAIR VALUE THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO BE MEASURED AT

FAIR VALUE. AN ENTITY REPORTS UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON ITEMS FOR WHICH

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED IN EARNINGS AT EACH SUBSEQUENT REPORTING

DATE. UPFRONT COSTS AND FEES RELATED TO ITEMS FOR WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION

IS ELECTED ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS INCURRED AND NOT DEFERRED. SFAS NO. 159

ALSO ESTABLISHED PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS DESIGNED TO

FACILITATE COMPARISONS BETWEEN ENTITIES THAT CHOOSE DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT

ATTRIBUTES FOR SIMILAR TYPES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. SFAS NO. 159 WAS

EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15,

2007 (JANUARY 1, 2008 FOR 3M) AND INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL

YEARS. AT THE EFFECTIVE DATE, AN ENTITY COULD ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR

ELIGIBLE ITEMS THAT EXISTED AT THAT DATE. THE ENTITY WAS REQUIRED TO REPORT THE

EFFECT OF THE FIRST REMEASUREMENT TO FAIR VALUE AS A CUMULATIVE-EFFECT

ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS. THE COMPANY DID NOT

ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR ELIGIBLE ITEMS THAT EXISTED AS OF JANUARY 1,

2008.

IN JUNE 2007, THE

FASBS EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE REACHED A CONSENSUS ON EITF ISSUE NO. 07-3,

ACCOUNTING FOR NONREFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS OR SERVICES TO BE USED

IN FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD REQUIRE NONREFUNDABLE

ADVANCE PAYMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY FOR FUTURE R&D ACTIVITIES TO BE

CAPITALIZED AND RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE AS THE GOODS OR SERVICES ARE RECEIVED

BY THE COMPANY. EITF ISSUE NO. 07-3 WAS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M WITH RESPECT TO

NEW ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2008. EITF ISSUE NO. 07-3

DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN DECEMBER 2007,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 141R, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, WHICH CHANGES THE

ACCOUNTING FOR BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS. SFAS NO. 141R REQUIRES THE ACQUIRING

ENTITY IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION TO RECOGNIZE ALL (AND ONLY) THE ASSETS

ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN THE TRANSACTION AND ESTABLISHES THE

ACQUISITION-DATE FAIR VALUE AS THE MEASUREMENT OBJECTIVE FOR ALL ASSETS

ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. CERTAIN PROVISIONS

OF THIS STANDARD WILL, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPACT THE DETERMINATION OF

ACQUISITION-DATE FAIR VALUE OF CONSIDERATION PAID IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION

(INCLUDING CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION); EXCLUDE TRANSACTION COSTS FROM

ACQUISITION ACCOUNTING; AND CHANGE ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR ACQUIRED

CONTINGENCIES, ACQUISITION-RELATED RESTRUCTURING COSTS, IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT, INDEMNIFICATION ASSETS, AND TAX BENEFITS. FOR 3M, SFAS NO. 141R

IS EFFECTIVE FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ADJUSTMENTS TO AN ACQUIRED ENTITYS

DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND LIABILITY BALANCES OCCURRING AFTER DECEMBER 31,

2008. THIS STANDARD WILL HAVE NO IMMEDIATE IMPACT UPON ADOPTION BY 3M, BUT WILL

RESULT IN ITEMS SUCH AS TRANSACTION AND ACQUISITION RELATED-RESTRUCTURING COSTS

WITH RESPECT TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS CLOSING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2008

BEING CHARGED TO EXPENSE WHEN INCURRED. THE COMPANY CONSIDERS THIS STANDARD

WHEN EVALUATING POTENTIAL FUTURE TRANSACTIONS TO WHICH IT WOULD APPLY.

IN DECEMBER 2007,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 160, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 51, WHICH ESTABLISHES NEW

STANDARDS GOVERNING THE ACCOUNTING FOR AND REPORTING OF NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS (NCIS) IN PARTIALLY OWNED CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES AND THE LOSS OF

CONTROL OF SUBSIDIARIES. CERTAIN PROVISIONS OF THIS STANDARD INDICATE, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, THAT NCIS (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS MINORITY INTERESTS) BE

TREATED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF EQUITY, NOT AS A LIABILITY; THAT INCREASES

AND DECREASES IN THE PARENTS OWNERSHIP INTEREST THAT LEAVE CONTROL INTACT BE

TREATED AS EQUITY TRANSACTIONS, RATHER THAN AS STEP ACQUISITIONS OR DILUTION

GAINS OR LOSSES; AND THAT LOSSES OF A PARTIALLY OWNED CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY

BE ALLOCATED TO THE NCI EVEN WHEN SUCH ALLOCATION MIGHT RESULT IN A DEFICIT

BALANCE. THIS STANDARD ALSO REQUIRES CHANGES TO CERTAIN PRESENTATION AND

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. FOR 3M, SFAS NO. 160 IS EFFECTIVE BEGINNING JANUARY 1,

2009. THE PROVISIONS OF THE STANDARD ARE TO BE APPLIED TO ALL NCIS PROSPECTIVELY,

EXCEPT FOR THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, WHICH ARE TO BE

APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. AS A RESULT, UPON ADOPTION,

3M EXPECTS TO RETROACTIVELY RECLASSIFY THE MINORITY INTEREST IN SUBSIDIARIES

BALANCE CURRENTLY INCLUDED IN THE OTHER LIABILITIES SECTION OF THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET TO A NEW COMPONENT OF EQUITY WITH RESPECT TO NCIS IN

CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES. THIS ADOPTION WILL IMPACT THE PRESENTATION OF 3MS

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME; HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE IT WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

IN DECEMBER 2007,

THE FASB RATIFIED THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE CONSENSUS ON EITF ISSUE NO. 07-1,

ACCOUNTING FOR COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS THAT DISCUSSES HOW PARTIES TO A

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT (WHICH DOES NOT ESTABLISH A LEGAL ENTITY WITHIN SUCH

ARRANGEMENT) SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR VARIOUS ACTIVITIES. THE CONSENSUS INDICATES

THAT COSTS INCURRED AND REVENUES GENERATED FROM TRANSACTIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES

(I.E. PARTIES OUTSIDE OF THE COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT) SHOULD BE REPORTED BY

THE COLLABORATORS ON THE RESPECTIVE LINE ITEMS IN THEIR INCOME STATEMENTS

PURSUANT TO EITF ISSUE NO. 99-19, REPORTING REVENUE GROSS AS A PRINCIPAL

VERSUS NET AS AN AGENT. ADDITIONALLY, THE CONSENSUS PROVIDES THAT INCOME

STATEMENT CHARACTERIZATION OF PAYMENTS BETWEEN THE PARTICIPANTS IN A

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT SHOULD BE BASED UPON EXISTING AUTHORITATIVE

PRONOUNCEMENTS; ANALOGY TO SUCH PRONOUNCEMENTS IF NOT WITHIN THEIR SCOPE; OR A

REASONABLE, RATIONAL, AND CONSISTENTLY APPLIED ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION. EITF

ISSUE NO. 07-1 IS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND IS

TO BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED FOR COLLABORATIVE

ARRANGEMENTS EXISTING AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT

EITF ISSUE NO. 07-1 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS

OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN MARCH 2008, THE

FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 161, DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND

HEDGING ACTIVITIES, WHICH WILL REQUIRE INCREASED DISCLOSURES ABOUT AN ENTITYS

STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES FOR USING DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS; THE LOCATION AND

AMOUNTS OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS IN AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; HOW

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED HEDGED ITEMS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES; AND HOW

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED HEDGED ITEMS AFFECT ITS FINANCIAL POSITION,

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND CASH FLOWS. CERTAIN DISCLOSURES WILL ALSO BE

REQUIRED WITH RESPECT TO DERIVATIVE FEATURES THAT ARE CREDIT-RISK-RELATED. SFAS

NO. 161 IS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 ON A

PROSPECTIVE BASIS. SINCE THIS STANDARD IMPACTS DISCLOSURES ONLY, THE ADOPTION

WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN APRIL 2008, THE

FASB ISSUED FSP NO. FAS 142-3, DETERMINATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OF

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, WHICH AMENDS THE LIST OF FACTORS AN ENTITY SHOULD CONSIDER

IN DEVELOPING RENEWAL OR EXTENSION ASSUMPTIONS USED IN DETERMINING THE USEFUL

LIFE OF RECOGNIZED INTANGIBLE ASSETS UNDER SFAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND

OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE NEW GUIDANCE APPLIES TO (1) INTANGIBLE

ASSETS THAT ARE ACQUIRED INDIVIDUALLY OR WITH A GROUP OF OTHER ASSETS AND (2) INTANGIBLE

ASSETS ACQUIRED IN BOTH BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND ASSET ACQUISITIONS. UNDER FSP

NO. FAS 142-3, ENTITIES ESTIMATING THE USEFUL LIFE OF A RECOGNIZED

INTANGIBLE ASSET MUST CONSIDER THEIR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE IN RENEWING OR

EXTENDING SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS OR, IN THE ABSENCE OF HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE,

MUST CONSIDER ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE ABOUT RENEWAL OR

EXTENSION. FOR 3M, THIS FSP WILL REQUIRE CERTAIN ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES

BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 AND APPLICATION TO USEFUL LIFE ESTIMATES

PROSPECTIVELY FOR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE

COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THIS STANDARD TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN

MAY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FSP NO. APB 14-1, ACCOUNTING FOR

CONVERTIBLE DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN CASH UPON CONVERSION

(INCLUDING PARTIAL CASH SETTLEMENT). THIS FSP APPLIES TO CONVERTIBLE DEBT

SECURITIES THAT, UPON CONVERSION BY THE HOLDER, MAY BE SETTLED BY THE ISSUER

FULLY OR PARTIALLY IN CASH (RATHER THAN SETTLED FULLY IN SHARES) AND SPECIFIES

THAT ISSUERS OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS SHOULD SEPARATELY ACCOUNT FOR THE LIABILITY

AND EQUITY COMPONENTS IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS THE ISSUERS NONCONVERTIBLE

DEBT BORROWING RATE WHEN RELATED INTEREST COST IS RECOGNIZED. THIS FSP IS

EFFECTIVE FOR 3M BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009 WITH RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION

TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. THIS STANDARD IMPACTS THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE

NOTES (REFER TO NOTE 10 FOR MORE DETAIL), AND WILL REQUIRE THAT ADDITIONAL

INTEREST EXPENSE ESSENTIALLY EQUIVALENT TO THE PORTION OF ISSUANCE PROCEEDS BE

RETROACTIVELY ALLOCATED TO THE INSTRUMENTS EQUITY COMPONENT AND BE RECOGNIZED

OVER THE PERIOD FROM THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES ISSUANCE ON NOVEMBER 15, 2002

THROUGH NOVEMBER 15, 2005 (THE FIRST DATE HOLDERS OF THESE NOTES HAD THE

ABILITY TO PUT THEM BACK TO 3M). 3M HAS EVALUATED THE IMPACT OF THIS STANDARD

AND ANTICIPATES THAT ITS RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION WILL HAVE NO IMPACT ON

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR PERIODS FOLLOWING 2005, BUT ON POST-2005 CONSOLIDATED

BALANCE SHEETS THIS WILL RESULT IN AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $22 MILLION IN

OPENING ADDITIONAL PAID IN CAPITAL AND A CORRESPONDING DECREASE IN OPENING

RETAINED EARNINGS.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FASB RATIFIED THE EMERGING

ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) CONSENSUS ON ISSUE NO. 08-6, EQUITY METHOD

INVESTMENT ACCOUNTING CONSIDERATIONS (EITF 08-6) WHICH ADDRESSES CERTAIN

EFFECTS OF SFAS NOS. 141R AND 160 ON AN ENTITYS ACCOUNTING FOR EQUITY-METHOD

INVESTMENTS. THE CONSENSUS INDICATES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT TRANSACTION

COSTS FOR AN INVESTMENT SHOULD BE INCLUDED IN THE COST OF THE EQUITY-METHOD

INVESTMENT (AND NOT EXPENSED) AND SHARES SUBSEQUENTLY ISSUED BY THE

EQUITY-METHOD INVESTEE THAT REDUCE THE INVESTORS OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE SHOULD

BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS IF THE INVESTOR HAD SOLD A PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ITS

INVESTMENT, WITH GAINS OR LOSSES RECORDED THROUGH EARNINGS. FOR 3M, EITF 08-6

COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT THIS STANDARD TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN NOVEMBER 2008, THE FASB RATIFIED THE EITF CONSENSUS

ON ISSUE NO. 08-7, ACCOUNTING FOR DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSETS (EITF

08-7). THE CONSENSUS ADDRESSES THE ACCOUNTING FOR AN INTANGIBLE ASSET ACQUIRED

IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION OR ASSET ACQUISITION THAT AN ENTITY DOES NOT INTEND

TO USE OR INTENDS TO HOLD TO PREVENT OTHERS FROM OBTAINING ACCESS (A DEFENSIVE

INTANGIBLE ASSET). UNDER EITF 08-7, A DEFENSIVE INTANGIBLE ASSET WOULD NEED TO

BE ACCOUNTED AS A SEPARATE UNIT OF ACCOUNTING AND WOULD BE ASSIGNED A USEFUL

LIFE BASED ON THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE ASSET DIMINISHES IN VALUE. FOR 3M, EITF

08-6 IS EFFECTIVE FOR TRANSACTIONS OCCURRING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE

COMPANY CONSIDERS THIS STANDARD IN TERMS OF EVALUATING POTENTIAL FUTURE

TRANSACTIONS TO WHICH IT WOULD APPLY.

IN DECEMBER 2008,

THE FASB ISSUED FSP NO. FAS 132(R)-1, EMPLOYERS DISCLOSURES ABOUT

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN ASSETS. THIS FSP REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES

ABOUT PLAN ASSETS FOR SPONSORS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

PLANS INCLUDING EXPANDED INFORMATION REGARDING INVESTMENT STRATEGIES, MAJOR

CATEGORIES OF PLAN ASSETS, AND CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK WITHIN PLAN ASSETS.

ADDITIONALLY, THIS FSP REQUIRES DISCLOSURES SIMILAR TO THOSE REQUIRED UNDER

SFAS NO. 157 WITH RESPECT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS SUCH AS THE

INPUTS AND VALUATION TECHNIQUES USED TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE AND INFORMATION WITH

RESPECT TO CLASSIFICATION OF PLAN ASSETS IN TERMS OF THE HIERARCHY OF THE

SOURCE OF INFORMATION USED TO DETERMINE THEIR VALUE (SEE NOTE 13). THE

DISCLOSURES UNDER THIS FSP ARE REQUIRED FOR ANNUAL PERIODS ENDING AFTER DECEMBER 15,

2009. 3M IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE REQUIREMENTS OF THESE ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES.

FASB ISSUED FSP NO. EITF 99-20-1, AMENDMENTS TO THE IMPAIRMENT GUIDANCE

OF EITF ISSUE NO. 99-20 (FSP NO. EITF 99-20-1). THIS FSP PROVIDED

ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE WITH RESPECT TO HOW ENTITIES DETERMINE WHETHER AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT (OTTI) EXISTS FOR CERTAIN BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN A SECURITIZED

TRANSACTION, SUCH AS ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES,

THAT (1) DO NOT HAVE A HIGH QUALITY RATING OR (2) CAN BE

CONTRACTUALLY PREPAID OR OTHERWISE SETTLED SUCH THAT THE HOLDER WOULD NOT

RECOVER SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS INVESTMENT. FSP NO. EITF 99-20-1 AMENDED

EITF ISSUE NO. 99-20 TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN ITS OTTI GUIDANCE WITH THAT OF

SFAS NO. 115, ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENT IN DEBT AND EQUITY

SECURITIES. THIS FSP WAS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M PROSPECTIVELY BEGINNING OCTOBER 1,

2008. THE COMPANY CONSIDERED THIS FSPS ADDITIONAL INTERPRETATION OF EITF ISSUE

NO. 99-20 WHEN CLASSIFYING RESPECTIVE ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENTS AS TEMPORARY

OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY BEGINNING WITH THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008. THIS FSP

NOTE

3.  GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 17 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS, EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008, 3M MADE CERTAIN PRODUCT

MOVES BETWEEN ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. SINCE THERE WERE NO MATERIAL CHANGES IN

GOODWILL BALANCES BETWEEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS, AMOUNTS PRESENTED IN THE TABLE

THAT FOLLOWS HAVE NOT BEEN RECLASSIFIED. FOR THOSE CHANGES THAT RESULTED IN

REPORTING UNIT CHANGES, THE COMPANY APPLIED THE RELATIVE FAIR VALUE METHOD TO

DETERMINE THE IMPACT TO REPORTING UNITS. SFAS NO. 142, GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS, REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST

ANNUALLY AND WHEN REPORTING UNITS ARE CHANGED. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF

2008, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ASSESSMENT OF ANY POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

UNDER THE NEW STRUCTURE AND DETERMINED THAT NO IMPAIRMENT EXISTED. THE COMPANY

COMPLETED ITS ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 AND

DETERMINED THAT NO IMPAIRMENT EXISTED.

PURCHASED GOODWILL FROM ACQUISITIONS TOTALED $1.392 BILLION

IN 2008, $34 MILLION OF WHICH IS DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. PURCHASED

GOODWILL FROM ACQUISITIONS TOTALED $326 MILLION IN 2007, $55 MILLION OF WHICH

IS DEDUCTIBLE FOR TAX PURPOSES. THE AMOUNTS IN THE TRANSLATION AND OTHER

COLUMN IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRIMARILY RELATE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES, EXCEPT FOR THE $77 MILLION DECREASE IN GOODWILL RELATED TO THE

SECOND-QUARTER 2008 SALE OF 3MS HIGHJUMP SOFTWARE BUSINESS (INCLUDED IN THE

SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES BUSINESS). THE GOODWILL BALANCE BY

NOTE

4.  RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT

ACTIVITIES

RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT ACTIVITIES GENERALLY INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT

ACTIONS INVOLVING EMPLOYEE-RELATED SEVERANCE CHARGES, CONTRACT TERMINATION

COSTS, AND IMPAIRMENT OF ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH ACTIONS.

EMPLOYEE-RELATED

SEVERANCE CHARGES ARE LARGELY BASED UPON DISTRIBUTED EMPLOYMENT POLICIES AND

SUBSTANTIVE SEVERANCE PLANS AND ARE REFLECTED IN THE QUARTER IN WHICH

MANAGEMENT APPROVES THE ASSOCIATED ACTIONS. SEVERANCE AMOUNTS FOR WHICH

AFFECTED EMPLOYEES WERE REQUIRED TO RENDER SERVICE IN ORDER TO RECEIVE BENEFITS

AT THEIR TERMINATION DATES WERE MEASURED AT THE DATE SUCH BENEFITS WERE

COMMUNICATED TO THE APPLICABLE EMPLOYEES AND RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE

EMPLOYEES REMAINING SERVICE PERIODS.

CONTRACT

TERMINATION AND OTHER CHARGES PRIMARILY REFLECT COSTS TO TERMINATE A CONTRACT

BEFORE THE END OF ITS TERM (MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AT THE TIME THE COMPANY

PROVIDED NOTICE TO THE COUNTERPARTY) OR COSTS THAT WILL CONTINUE TO BE INCURRED

UNDER THE CONTRACT FOR ITS REMAINING TERM WITHOUT ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO THE

COMPANY. AS DISCUSSED IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES IN NOTE 1, ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT REFLECT

THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUES OVER THEIR FAIR VALUES.

THE FOLLOWING PROVIDES INFORMATION, RESPECTIVELY, CONCERNING THE COMPANYS

FOURTH-QUARTER 2008 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS, ITS 2006/2007 RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS,

AND ITS EXIT ACTIVITIES DURING 2008 AND 2007.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87,

88, 106 AND 132(R). THIS STANDARD ELIMINATED THE REQUIREMENT FOR A MINIMUM

PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED UNDER SFAS NO. 87

AND REQUIRED EMPLOYERS TO RECOGNIZE THE UNDERFUNDED OR OVERFUNDED STATUS OF A

DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

POSITION. IN 2006, AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SFAS NO. 158, THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN AFTER-TAX DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME OF $1.187 BILLION AND $513 MILLION FOR THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

PENSION BENEFIT PLANS, RESPECTIVELY, AND $218 MILLION FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLANS.

RECLASSIFICATION

ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE TO AVOID DOUBLE COUNTING IN COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS

THAT ARE ALSO RECORDED AS PART OF NET INCOME. IN 2008, $79 MILLION PRE-TAX ($52

MILLION AFTER-TAX), WERE RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE IN THE INCOME

STATEMENT. IN 2007, $198 MILLION PRE-TAX ($123 MILLION AFTER-TAX) WERE

RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO PENSION

AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE IN THE INCOME STATEMENT. THESE PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AMOUNTS ARE SHOWN IN THE TABLE IN NOTE 11 AS

AMORTIZATION OF TRANSITION (ASSET) OBLIGATION, AMORTIZATION OF PRIOR SERVICE

COST (BENEFIT) AND AMORTIZATION OF NET ACTUARIAL (GAIN) LOSS. CASH FLOW HEDGING

THE COMPANY FILES INCOME

TAX RETURNS IN THE U.S. FEDERAL JURISDICTION, AND VARIOUS STATES AND FOREIGN

JURISDICTIONS. WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO U.S.

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL, OR NON-U.S. INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS BY TAX AUTHORITIES

FOR YEARS BEFORE 2002. DURING 2008, THE COMPANY PAID IRS ASSESSMENTS RELATED TO

TAX AND INTEREST FOR THE 2001 THROUGH 2004 TAX YEARS. THE IRSS ADJUSTMENTS TO

THE COMPANYS TAX POSITIONS INCLUDING

67

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEREST WERE FULLY

RESERVED. AS A RESULT OF THESE ADDITIONAL TAX PAYMENTS, THE COMPANYS NET

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR TAX AND INTEREST WERE REDUCED BY $71 MILLION

DURING 2008.

IN ADDITION TO THE U.S.

FEDERAL EXAMINATION, THERE IS ALSO LIMITED AUDIT ACTIVITY IN SEVERAL U.S. STATE

AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE LIABILITY FOR

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL CHANGE BY AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT DURING THE

NEXT 12 MONTHS.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE

PROVISIONS OF FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES,

ON JANUARY 1, 2007. AS A RESULT OF THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERPRETATION 48, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN IMMATERIAL

INCREASE IN THE LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, WHICH WAS ACCOUNTED

FOR AS A REDUCTION TO THE JANUARY 1, 2007, BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS. A

RECONCILIATION OF THE BEGINNING AND ENDING AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX

THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT THE EFFECTIVE TAX

RATE AS OF BOTH DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007 IS $334

MILLION. THE ENDING NET UTB RESULTS FROM ADJUSTING THE GROSS BALANCE FOR ITEMS

SUCH AS FEDERAL, STATE, AND NON-U.S. DEFERRED ITEMS, INTEREST AND PENALTIES,

AND DEDUCTIBLE TAXES. THE NET UTB IS INCLUDED AS COMPONENTS OF ACCRUED INCOME

TAXES AND OTHER LIABILITIES WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES

INTEREST AND PENALTIES ACCRUED RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN TAX

EXPENSE. DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007, THE COMPANY

RECOGNIZED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME ON A GROSS BASIS

APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION AND $9 MILLION IN INTEREST AND PENALTIES,

RESPECTIVELY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007, ACCRUED

INTEREST AND PENALTIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET ON A GROSS BASIS WERE

$47 MILLION AND $69 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INCLUDED IN THESE INTEREST AND

PENALTY AMOUNTS ARE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO TAX POSITIONS FOR WHICH

THE ULTIMATE DEDUCTIBILITY IS HIGHLY CERTAIN BUT FOR WHICH THERE IS UNCERTAINTY

ABOUT THE TIMING OF SUCH DEDUCTIBILITY. BECAUSE OF THE IMPACT OF DEFERRED TAX

ACCOUNTING, OTHER THAN INTEREST AND PENALTIES, THE DISALLOWANCE OF THE SHORTER

DEDUCTIBILITY PERIOD WOULD NOT AFFECT THE ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BUT WOULD

ACCELERATE THE PAYMENT OF CASH TO THE TAXING AUTHORITY TO AN EARLIER PERIOD.

IN 2008 AND 2007, THE

COMPANY COMPLETED THE PREPARATION AND FILING OF ITS U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE

INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH DID NOT RESULT IN ANY

MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION. IN 2006, CONSIDERING THE

DEVELOPMENTS NOTED BELOW AND OTHER FACTORS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT ON OPEN AUDIT

YEARS OF THE RESOLUTION OF ISSUES IN VARIOUS AUDITS, REASSESSMENTS RESULTED IN

A REDUCTION OF THE RESERVES IN 2006 BY $149 MILLION, INCLUSIVE OF THE EXPECTED

AMOUNT OF CERTAIN REFUND CLAIMS. IN 2006, AN AUDIT OF THE COMPANYS U.S. TAX

RETURNS FOR YEARS THROUGH 2001 WAS COMPLETED. THE COMPANY AND THE INTERNAL

REVENUE SERVICE REACHED A FINAL SETTLEMENT FOR THESE YEARS, INCLUDING AN

AGREEMENT ON THE AMOUNT OF A REFUND CLAIM TO BE FILED BY THE COMPANY. THE

COMPANY ALSO SUBSTANTIALLY RESOLVED AUDITS IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. IN

ADDITION, THE COMPANY COMPLETED THE PREPARATION AND FILING OF ITS 2005 U.S.

FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURN AND THE CORRESPONDING 2005 STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS.

THE ADJUSTMENTS FROM AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED IN THE U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE

INCOME TAX RETURNS (BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE) INCLUDED LOWER U.S. TAXES ON

DIVIDENDS RECEIVED FROM THE COMPANYS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY ALSO

MADE QUARTERLY ADJUSTMENTS (BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE) TO ITS RESERVES FOR TAX

CONTINGENCIES.

THE COMPANY MADE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS

U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN OF $200 MILLION IN 2008, $200 MILLION IN 2007, AND

$200 MILLION IN 2006. THE CURRENT

INCOME TAX PROVISION INCLUDES A BENEFIT FOR THE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS; THE

DEFERRED TAX PROVISION INCLUDES A COST FOR THE RELATED TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE.

AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT COMMITMENTS AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS

MADE BY 3M, INCOME FROM MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES IS

SUBJECT TO REDUCED TAX RATES OR, IN SOME CASES, IS EXEMPT FROM TAX FOR YEARS

THROUGH 201

4. THE INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

TAX STATUS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $44 MILLION (6 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2008, $47 MILLION (6 CENTS PER DILUTED

SHARE) IN 2007, AND $20 MILLION (3 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2006.

THE COMPANY HAS

NOT PROVIDED DEFERRED TAXES ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO

INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE REINVESTED

INDEFINITELY. THESE EARNINGS RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS AND WERE

APPROXIMATELY $5.9 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. BECAUSE OF THE

AVAILABILITY OF U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE

THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE NOT

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED.

CLASSIFICATION OF

MARKETABLE SECURITIES AS CURRENT OR NON-CURRENT IS DEPENDENT UPON MANAGEMENTS

INTENDED HOLDING PERIOD, THE SECURITYS MATURITY DATE AND LIQUIDITY

CONSIDERATIONS BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS. IF MANAGEMENT INTENDS TO HOLD THE

SECURITIES FOR LONGER THAN ONE YEAR AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE, THEY ARE

CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES

TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION (PRE-TAX), WHILE GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS WERE

NOT MATERIAL. GROSS UNREALIZED LOSSES RELATED TO AUCTION RATE SECURITIES

TOTALED $16 MILLION, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW, WHILE OTHER SECURITIES

HAVE EXPERIENCED UNREALIZED LOSSES OF $14 MILLION AS CREDIT SPREADS HAVE

WIDENED. GROSS REALIZED GAINS ON SALES OR MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES

WERE $5 MILLION IN 2008, $7 MILLION IN 2007 AND NOT MATERIAL FOR 2006. GROSS

REALIZED LOSSES ON SALES OR MATURITIES OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE NOT

MATERIAL FOR 2008, 2007 AND 2006. COST OF SECURITIES SOLD OR RECLASSIFIED USE

THE FIRST IN, FIRST OUT (FIFO) METHOD. SINCE THESE MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE

CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE WILL FLOW

THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WITH AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO EARNINGS UPON SALE OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT.

3M HAS A DIVERSIFIED

MARKETABLE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO OF $725 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

WITHIN THIS PORTFOLIO, CURRENT AND LONG-TERM ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES (ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE OF $111 MILLION) ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF INTERESTS IN AUTOMOBILE

LOANS AND CREDIT CARDS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES

CREDIT RATINGS WERE AAA OR A-1+, WITH THE FOLLOWING EXCEPTIONS: THREE

SECURITIES RATED BBB WITH A FAIR MARKET VALUE OF $5 MILLION. 3MS

69

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MARKETABLE SECURITIES

PORTFOLIO ALSO INCLUDES AUCTION RATE SECURITIES (ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $1

MILLION) THAT REPRESENT INTERESTS IN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS.

DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2007 AND ALL FOUR QUARTERS IN 2008, THESE AUCTION

RATE SECURITIES FAILED TO AUCTION DUE TO SELL ORDERS EXCEEDING BUY ORDERS.

LIQUIDITY FOR THESE AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES IS TYPICALLY PROVIDED BY AN AUCTION

PROCESS THAT RESETS THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE AT PRE-DETERMINED INTERVALS,

USUALLY EVERY 7, 28, 35, OR 90 DAYS. THE FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH FAILED AUCTIONS

WILL NOT BE ACCESSIBLE UNTIL A SUCCESSFUL AUCTION OCCURS OR A BUYER IS FOUND

OUTSIDE OF THE AUCTION PROCESS. BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS OF TEMPORARY AND OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT FACTORS, AUCTION RATE SECURITIES WITH AN ORIGINAL PAR VALUE OF

APPROXIMATELY $34 MILLION WERE WRITTEN-DOWN TO AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $16

MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND SUBSEQUENTLY WRITTEN-DOWN TO AN

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $1 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. 3M RECORDED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT REDUCED PRE-TAX INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $8 MILLION IN

2007 AND APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION IN 2008. THERE ARE $16 MILLION (PRE-TAX) OF

TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, WHICH WERE RECORDED AS

UNREALIZED LOSSES WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, THESE INVESTMENTS IN AUCTION RATE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN IN A LOSS POSITION

FOR APPROXIMATELY 15 MONTHS. THESE AUCTION RATE SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS

NON-CURRENT MARKETABLE SECURITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008 AS INDICATED IN

THE PRECEDING TABLE. REFER TO NOTE 13 FOR A TABLE THAT RECONCILES THE BEGINNING

AND ENDING BALANCES OF AUCTION RATE SECURITIES FOR 2008.

OF THE IMPAIRMENT AS TEMPORARY OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. A TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RESULTS IN AN UNREALIZED LOSS BEING RECORDED IN THE OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. SUCH AN UNREALIZED LOSS

DOES NOT REDUCE NET INCOME FOR THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING PERIOD BECAUSE THE

LOSS IS NOT VIEWED AS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A PORTION

OF THE IMPAIRMENT OF ITS AUCTION RATE SECURITIES INVESTMENTS IS TEMPORARY AND A

PORTION IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. THE FACTORS EVALUATED TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN

TEMPORARY AND OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY INCLUDE THE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS,

CREDIT RATINGS ACTIONS, AND ASSESSMENT OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL.

MILLION CARRYING AMOUNT OF CONVERTIBLE NOTES, AS A RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS.

THE

ESOP DEBT IS SERVICED BY DIVIDENDS ON STOCK HELD BY THE ESOP AND BY COMPANY

CONTRIBUTIONS. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT REPORTED AS INTEREST EXPENSE, BUT

ARE REPORTED AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME. OTHER BORROWINGS INCLUDES DEBT HELD BY 3MS INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES AND

FLOATING RATE NOTES IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH THE LONG-TERM PORTION OF THIS

DEBT PRIMARILY COMPOSED OF U.S. DOLLAR FLOATING RATE DEBT.

INVESTORS SERVICE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, CERTAIN DEBT AGREEMENTS ($350

MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES AND $44 MILLION OF ESOP DEBT)

HAD RATINGS TRIGGERS (BBB-/BAA3 OR LOWER) THAT WOULD REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF DEBT.

IN ADDITION, UNDER THE COMPANYS $1.5-BILLION FIVE-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT

THAT WAS EFFECTIVE APRIL 30, 2007, 3M IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ITS EBITDA

TO INTEREST RATIO AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL QUARTER AT NOT LESS THAN 3.0 TO

1. THIS IS CALCULATED (AS DEFINED IN THE AGREEMENT) AS THE RATIO OF

CONSOLIDATED TOTAL EBITDA FOR THE FOUR CONSECUTIVE QUARTERS THEN ENDED TO TOTAL

INTEREST EXPENSE ON ALL FUNDED DEBT FOR THE SAME PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, THIS RATIO WAS APPROXIMATELY 30 TO 1. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008,

AVAILABLE SHORT-TERM COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT, INCLUDING THE PRECEDING $1.5

BILLION FIVE-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY, TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $1.582 BILLION, OF

WHICH APPROXIMATELY $143 MILLION WAS UTILIZED IN CONNECTION WITH NORMAL

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. DEBT COVENANTS DO NOT RESTRICT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

THE COMPANY HAS A WELL-KNOWN

SEASONED ISSUER SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 24,

2006, WHICH REGISTERS AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES FOR

FUTURE SALES. ON JUNE 15, 2007, THE COMPANY REGISTERED 150,718 SHARES OF

THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK UNDER THIS SHELF ON BEHALF OF AND FOR THE SOLE

BENEFIT OF THE SELLING STOCKHOLDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANYS

ACQUISITION OF ASSETS OF DIAMOND PRODUCTIONS, INC.

THE COMPANY

INTENDS TO USE THE PROCEEDS FROM ITS FUTURE SECURITIES SALES OFF THIS SHELF FOR

GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SHELF REGISTRATION, IN JUNE 2007 THE

COMPANY FILED A PROSPECTUS RELATING TO THE OFFERING OF UP TO $3 BILLION OF

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES. IN DECEMBER 2007, 3M ISSUED A FIVE-YEAR, $500 MILLION,

FIXED RATE NOTE WITH A COUPON RATE OF 4.65% UNDER THIS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES

PROGRAM. IN AUGUST 2008, 3M ISSUED A FIVE-YEAR, $850 MILLION, FIXED RATE

NOTE WITH A COUPON RATE OF 4.375% UNDER THIS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM. IN OCTOBER 2008,

THE COMPANY ISSUED A THREE-YEAR $800 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE WITH A COUPON

RATE OF 4.50% UNDER THIS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM, REDUCING REMAINING CAPACITY

TO $850 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE COMPANY HAS THE ABILITY TO

INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES THAT ARE AUTHORIZED TO BE ISSUED UNDER THIS

PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY ALSO ISSUED NOTES UNDER AN EARLIER

MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM. IN MARCH 2007, THE COMPANY ISSUED A 30-YEAR,

$750 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE WITH A COUPON RATE OF 5.70%. IN NOVEMBER 2006,

3M ISSUED A THREE-YEAR, $400 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE. THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO

AN INTEREST RATE SWAP TO CONVERT THIS TO A RATE BASED ON A FLOATING LIBOR

INDEX. IN DECEMBER 2004, 3M ISSUED A 40-YEAR, $62 MILLION, FLOATING RATE

NOTE, WITH THE RATE BASED ON A FLOATING LIBOR INDEX. THIS $1.5 BILLION MEDIUM

TERM NOTES PROGRAM WAS REPLACED BY THE $3 BILLION PROGRAM ESTABLISHED IN JUNE 2007.

IN JULY 2007, 3M

ISSUED A SEVEN YEAR 5.0% FIXED RATE EUROBOND FOR AN AMOUNT OF 750 MILLION EUROS

(BOOK VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.094 BILLION IN U.S. DOLLARS AT DECEMBER 31,

2008). UPON DEBT ISSUANCE IN JULY 2007, 3M COMPLETED A FIXED-TO-FLOATING

INTEREST RATE SWAP ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 400 MILLION EUROS AS A FAIR VALUE

HEDGE OF A PORTION OF THE FIXED INTEREST RATE EUROBOND OBLIGATION. IN DECEMBER 2007,

3M REOPENED THE EXISTING SEVEN YEAR 5.0% FIXED RATE EUROBOND FOR AN ADDITIONAL

AMOUNT OF 275 MILLION EUROS (BOOK VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $391 MILLION IN U.S.

DOLLARS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008). THIS SECURITY WAS ISSUED AT A PREMIUM AND

WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CONSOLIDATED WITH THE ORIGINAL SECURITY ON JANUARY 15,

2008.

3M

MAY REDEEM ITS 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES (THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES) AT

ANY TIME IN WHOLE OR IN PART AT THE ACCRETED CONVERSION PRICE; HOWEVER,

BONDHOLDERS MAY CONVERT UPON NOTIFICATION OF REDEMPTION EACH OF THE NOTES INTO

9.4602 SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK. HOLDERS OF THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR

NOTES HAVE THE OPTION TO REQUIRE 3M TO PURCHASE THEIR NOTES AT ACCRETED VALUE

ON NOVEMBER 21 IN THE YEARS 2005, 2007, 2012, 2017, 2022 AND 2027. IN NOVEMBER 2005,

22,506 OF THE 639,000 IN OUTSTANDING BONDS WERE REDEEMED, RESULTING IN A PAYOUT

FROM 3M OF APPROXIMATELY $20 MILLION. IN NOVEMBER 2007, AN ADDITIONAL

364,598 OUTSTANDING BONDS WERE REDEEMED RESULTING IN A PAYOUT FROM 3M OF

APPROXIMATELY $322 MILLION. THESE PAYOUTS REDUCED THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES FACE

VALUE AT MATURITY TO $252 MILLION, WHICH EQUATES TO A BOOK VALUE OF

APPROXIMATELY $224 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008. AS DISCLOSED IN A FORM 8-K

IN NOVEMBER 2005, 3M AMENDED THE TERMS OF THESE SECURITIES TO PAY CASH AT

A RATE OF 2.40% PER ANNUM OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AT MATURITY OF THE COMPANYS

CONVERTIBLE NOTES, WHICH EQUATES TO 2.75% PER ANNUM OF THE NOTES ACCRETED

VALUE ON NOVEMBER 21, 2005. THE CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS WERE MADE

SEMIANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON MAY 22, 2006, NOVEMBER 22, 2006, MAY 22,

2007 AND NOVEMBER 22, 2007 TO HOLDERS OF RECORD ON THE 15TH CALENDAR DAY

TABLE OF

CONTENTS

PRECEDING

EACH SUCH INTEREST PAYMENT DATE. EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 22, 2007, THE

EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE REVERTED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL YIELD OF 0.50%.

3M

ORIGINALLY SOLD $639 MILLION IN AGGREGATE FACE AMOUNT OF THESE CONVERTIBLE

NOTES ON NOVEMBER 15, 2002, WHICH ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF 3M

COMMON STOCK. THE GROSS PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING, TO BE USED FOR GENERAL

CORPORATE PURPOSES, WERE $550 MILLION ($540 MILLION NET OF ISSUANCE COSTS).

DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS WERE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A THREE-YEAR

PERIOD BEGINNING IN NOVEMBER 2002. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2003, 3M

REGISTERED THESE CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN A REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THE TERMS OF THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES INCLUDE

A YIELD TO MATURITY OF 0.50% AND AN INITIAL CONVERSION PREMIUM OF 40 PERCENT

OVER THE $65.00 (SPLIT-ADJUSTED) CLOSING PRICE OF 3M COMMON STOCK ON NOVEMBER 14,

2002. IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION (RELATING TO THE CLOSING COMMON

STOCK PRICES OF 3M EXCEEDING THE CONVERSION TRIGGER PRICE FOR SPECIFIED

PERIODS) ARE MET, HOLDERS MAY CONVERT EACH OF THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR

NOTES INTO 9.4602 SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK IN ANY CALENDAR QUARTER COMMENCING

AFTER MARCH 31, 2003. THE CONVERSION TRIGGER PRICE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2008 WAS $121.81 PER SHARE. IF THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, AND 3M

ELECTS NOT TO SETTLE IN CASH, THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES WILL BE

CONVERTIBLE IN THE AGGREGATE INTO APPROXIMATELY 2.4 MILLION SHARES OF 3M COMMON

STOCK. THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES

HAVE NEVER BEEN MET. IF THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, 3M MAY CHOOSE TO

PAY IN CASH AND/OR COMMON STOCK; HOWEVER, IF THIS OCCURS, THE COMPANY HAS THE

INTENT AND ABILITY TO SETTLE THIS DEBT SECURITY IN CASH. ACCORDINGLY, THERE WAS

NO IMPACT ON 3MS DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.

IN DECEMBER 2008, THE COMPANYS $350 MILLION OF

DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE REMARKETED FOR ONE YEAR. THEY WERE REISSUED

WITH A FIXED COUPON RATE OF 7.14%. THESE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED

AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, WERE ISSUED IN DECEMBER 2000. THE

REMARKETABLE SECURITIES CAN BE REMARKETED ANNUALLY, AT THE OPTION OF THE

DEALER, FOR A YEAR EACH TIME, WITH A FINAL MATURITY DATE OF DECEMBER 2010.

NOTE 11.  PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS

3M

HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S.

EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENSION BENEFITS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANS GENERALLY ARE BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF

SERVICE, COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IN ADDITION TO

PROVIDING PENSION BENEFITS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES CERTAIN POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH

CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS U.S. EMPLOYEES

WHO REACH RETIREMENT AGE WHILE EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. MOST INTERNATIONAL

EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES ARE COVERED BY GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. THE COST

OF COMPANY-PROVIDED POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE PLANS FOR INTERNATIONAL

EMPLOYEES IS NOT MATERIAL AND IS COMBINED WITH U.S. AMOUNTS.

THE

COMPANYS PENSION FUNDING POLICY IS TO DEPOSIT WITH INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES

AMOUNTS ALLOWABLE BY LAW. TRUST FUNDS AND DEPOSITS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

MAINTAINED TO PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR

BENEFICIARIES. THERE ARE NO PLAN ASSETS IN THE NON-QUALIFIED PLAN DUE TO ITS

NATURE. FOR ITS U.S. POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT

PLANS, THE COMPANY HAS SET ASIDE AMOUNTS AT LEAST EQUAL TO ANNUAL BENEFIT

PAYMENTS WITH AN INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE.

IN

AUGUST 2006, THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT (PPA) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN THE

U.S. THE PPA INCREASED THE FUNDING TARGET FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS TO

100 PERCENT OF THE TARGET LIABILITY. THE PPA TRANSITION RULES REQUIRE A FUNDING

LIABILITY TARGET OF 92 PERCENT IN 2008, REACHING 100 PERCENT BY 2011. 3MS U.S.

QUALIFIED DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE FUNDED AT THE APPLICABLE TRANSITION FUNDING

LIABILITY TARGET FOR 2008.

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

PLANS, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R), THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZES THE UNDERFUNDED OR OVERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN ITS STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL POSITION, AND RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN THE FUNDED STATUS IN THE YEAR IN

WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH

IS A COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER

OF 2008, THE COMPANY MADE MODIFICATIONS TO ITS U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

PLAN. THE CHANGES ARE EFFECTIVE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009, AND ALLOW

CURRENT RETIRED EMPLOYEES AND EMPLOYEES WHO RETIRE BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2013

THE OPTION TO CONTINUE ON THE EXISTING POSTRETIREMENT PLANS OR ELECT THE NEW

PLANS. CURRENT EMPLOYEES WHO RETIRE AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2012, WILL RECEIVE

A SAVINGS ACCOUNT BENEFITS-BASED PLAN. AS A RESULT OF THE MODIFICATION TO THE

U.S. POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS PLAN, THE COMPANY REMEASURED ITS U.S. PLANS ASSETS

AND ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION (APBO) AS OF MARCH 31,

2008. THE IMPACT OF THE PLAN MODIFICATIONS REDUCED THE APBO BY $148 MILLION,

WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ASSET VALUES BEING $97 MILLION LOWER THAN ON DECEMBER 31,

2007. THEREFORE, THE ACCRUED BENEFIT COST LIABILITY RECORDED ON THE BALANCE

SHEET AS OF MARCH 31, 2008, WAS REDUCED BY $51 MILLION. THE REMEASUREMENT

REDUCED THE 2008 EXPENSE BY $15 MILLION.

ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. THE

COMPANY SETS ITS RATE TO REFLECT THE YIELD OF A PORTFOLIO OF HIGH QUALITY,

FIXED-INCOME DEBT INSTRUMENTS THAT WOULD PRODUCE CASH FLOWS SUFFICIENT IN

AND AMOUNT TO SETTLE

PROJECTED FUTURE BENEFITS. USING THIS METHODOLOGY, THE COMPANY DETERMINED A

EXTERNAL DATA AND ITS OWN HISTORICAL TRENDS FOR HEALTH CARE COSTS TO DETERMINE

THE HEALTH CARE TREND RATES FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS. THE COMPANY

SEPARATES THE TREND RATES USED FOR PLAN PARTICIPANTS LESS THAN 65 YEARS OF AGE

AND PLAN PARTICIPANTS 65 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. THE SEPARATION OF THE TREND

RATES REFLECTS THE HIGHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN THE 65 OR

OLDER AGE GROUP. THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE TREND RATES AS OF DECEMBER 31 ARE

3MS

INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IS TO MANAGE THE

PLANS ON A GOING-CONCERN BASIS. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE FUNDS IS TO MEET THE

OBLIGATIONS AS REQUIRED. THE SECONDARY GOAL IS TO EARN THE HIGHEST RATE OF

RETURN POSSIBLE, WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING ITS PRIMARY GOAL, AND WITHOUT SUBJECTING

THE COMPANY TO AN UNDUE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTION RATE VOLATILITY. FUND RETURNS

ARE USED TO HELP FINANCE PRESENT AND FUTURE OBLIGATIONS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE

WITHIN ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED FUNDING LIMITS AND TAX-DETERMINED ASSET LIMITS,

THUS REDUCING THE LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTIONS 3M MUST MAKE.

3M

DOES NOT BUY OR SELL ANY OF ITS OWN STOCK AS A DIRECT INVESTMENT FOR ITS

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT FUNDS. HOWEVER, DUE TO EXTERNAL

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT OF THE FUNDS, THE PLANS MAY INDIRECTLY BUY, SELL OR HOLD

3M STOCK. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE SHARES WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE

MATERIAL RELATIVE TO THE AGGREGATE FUND PERCENTAGES.

FOR THE U.S. PENSION

PLAN, THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.50%

IN 2008. PROJECTED RETURNS ARE BASED PRIMARILY ON BROAD, PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY

AND FIXED-INCOME INDICES AND FORWARD-LOOKING ESTIMATES OF ACTIVE PORTFOLIO AND

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANYS 2009

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON AN ASSET

ALLOCATION ASSUMPTION OF 40 PERCENT GLOBAL EQUITIES, WITH AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN OF 8.7%; 13 PERCENT PRIVATE EQUITIES WITH AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF RETURN OF 10.7%; 26 PERCENT FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES WITH AN EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF 4.7%; 16 PERCENT ABSOLUTE RETURN INVESTMENTS

INDEPENDENT OF TRADITIONAL PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS, WITH AN EXPECTED LONG TERM

RETURN OF 7%; AND 5 PERCENT COMMODITIES WITH AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN OF 6.8%. THE COMPANY EXPECTS ADDITIONAL POSITIVE RETURN FROM ACTIVE INVESTMENT

MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSUMPTIONS RESULT IN AN 8.50% EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON AN

ANNUALIZED BASIS FOR 2009. THE ACTUAL RATE OF RETURN ON U.S. PLAN ASSETS IN

2008 WAS A LOSS OF 13.6%. IN 2007 AND 2006, THESE U.S. PLAN ASSETS EARNED A

RATE OF RETURN IN EXCESS OF 14% AND 12%, RESPECTIVELY. SINCE 2007, THE

INVESTMENT STRATEGY HAS USED LONG DURATION CASH AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO

ACHIEVE INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY THAT OFFSETS APPROXIMATELY 50 PERCENT OF THE

INTEREST RATE SENSITIVITY OF U.S. PENSION LIABILITIES. THE 2008 PERFORMANCE

BENEFITED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE LONG DURATION INSTRUMENTS. THE AVERAGE ANNUAL

ACTUAL RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS OVER THE PAST 10 AND 25 YEARS HAS BEEN 5.7%

AND 10.9%, RESPECTIVELY.

IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2008, THE COMPANY MADE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS

TOTALING $200 MILLION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. IN 2009, THE COMPANY

EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE AN AMOUNT IN THE RANGE OF $600 MILLION TO $850 MILLION TO

ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED

MINIMUM PENSION CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2009. THEREFORE,

THE AMOUNT OF THE ANTICIPATED DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION COULD VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE U.S. PLANS FUNDING STATUS AS OF THE 2009

THE

COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS, COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS, AND

FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED WITH FOREIGN

EXCHANGE RATE, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. THE INFORMATION

THAT FOLLOWS EXPLAINS THE VARIOUS TYPES OF DERIVATIVES AND FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS, AND INCLUDES A TABLE THAT RECAPS CASH FLOW HEDGING AMOUNTS.

CASH FLOW

HEDGING - FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE

FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAPS TO HEDGE AGAINST THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE

RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN

INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH

FLOW HEDGES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD VARIOUS OPEN FOREIGN

EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS, THE MAJORITY OF WHICH HAD MATURITIES OF

ONE YEAR OR LESS. THE SETTLEMENT OR EXTENSION OF THESE DERIVATIVES WILL RESULT

IN RECLASSIFICATIONS TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED

TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS (FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME). THE MAXIMUM

LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH 3M IS HEDGING ITS EXPOSURE TO THE VARIABILITY IN

FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR A MAJORITY OF THE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS IS 12 MONTHS.

HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS 2008, 2007 AND 2006.

CASH FLOW HEDGING - COMMODITY PRICE MANAGEMENT.

THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE

RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND

FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY USES COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS AS CASH FLOW

HEDGES OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS TO MANAGE PRICE VOLATILITY. THE RELATED

MARK-TO-MARKET GAIN OR LOSS ON QUALIFYING HEDGES IS INCLUDED IN OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, AND RECLASSIFIED INTO COST OF

SALES IN THE PERIOD DURING WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. 3M

HAS HEDGED ITS EXPOSURE TO THE VARIABILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR CERTAIN

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS THROUGH 2009. NO SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY CASH FLOW HEDGES

WERE DISCONTINUED AND HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL DURING THE YEARS

2008, 2007 AND 2006.

CASH FLOW HEDGING - FORECASTED

DEBT ISSUANCE.

IN JUNE 2007, THE COMPANY EXECUTED A

PRE-ISSUANCE CASH FLOW HEDGE BY ENTERING INTO A FLOATING-TO-FIXED INTEREST RATE

SWAP ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 350 MILLION EUROS RELATED TO THE ANTICIPATED JULY 2007

EUROBOND ISSUANCE OF 750 MILLION EUROS. UPON DEBT ISSUANCE IN JULY 2007,

3M TERMINATED THE FLOATING-TO-FIXED SWAP. THE TERMINATION OF THE SWAP RESULTED

IN AN IMMATERIAL GAIN, WHICH IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE SEVEN-YEAR LIFE OF THE

EUROBOND.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECLASSIFY TO EARNINGS OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS A

MAJORITY OF THE CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS AFTER-TAX GAIN OF $44 MILLION

(WITH THE IMPACT OFFSET BY CASH FLOWS FROM UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEMS).

FAIR

VALUE HEDGING - INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES INTEREST EXPENSE USING A MIX OF

FIXED AND FLOATING RATE DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE BORROWING COSTS, THE COMPANY MAY

ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY AGREES TO

EXCHANGE, AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND FLOATING

INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AN AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL

AMOUNT.

AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, THE COMPANY HAD INTEREST RATE SWAPS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF

UNDERLYING FIXED RATE OBLIGATIONS. IN JUNE 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO

A $330 MILLION FIXED-TO-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAP TO HEDGE THE 30-YEAR BOND

DUE IN 2028. THE COMPANY TERMINATED THE SWAP IN MARCH 2007 AND THE

RESULTING GAIN WILL BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING

DEBT. ACCORDINGLY, THE TERMINATION OF THE SWAP DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. AS INDICATED

IN NOTE 10, IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $400 MILLION

FIXED-TO-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONCURRENT WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE

THREE-YEAR MEDIUM-TERM NOTE DUE IN 2009. ALSO AS INDICATED IN NOTE 10, IN JULY 2007,

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF A SEVEN-YEAR EUROBOND FOR AN AMOUNT OF 750

MILLION EUROS, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A FIXED-TO-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAP ON

A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 400 MILLION EUROS AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE OF A PORTION OF

THE FIXED INTEREST RATE EUROBOND OBLIGATION. THE MARK-TO-MARKET OF THESE FAIR

VALUE HEDGES IS RECORDED AS GAINS OR LOSSES IN INTEREST EXPENSE AND IS OFFSET

BY THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE UNDERLYING DEBT INSTRUMENT, WHICH ALSO IS RECORDED

IN INTEREST EXPENSE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE OUTSTANDING INTEREST RATE SWAPS

WERE $53 MILLION AND $36 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008

AND 2007. THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE 100 PERCENT EFFECTIVE AND, THUS, THERE IS

NO IMPACT ON EARNINGS DUE TO HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS.

FAIR VALUE HEDGING  FOREIGN

CURRENCY.

IN NOVEMBER 2008,

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS TO PURCHASE

JAPANESE YEN, POUND STERLING, AND EUROS WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $255 MILLION

AT THE CONTRACT RATES. THESE CONTRACTS WERE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF

A

U.S. DOLLAR TAX OBLIGATION.

THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES MATURED IN EARLY JANUARY 2009. THE MARK-TO-MARKET

OF THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES IS RECORDED AS GAINS OR LOSSES IN TAX EXPENSE AND IS

OFFSET BY THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE UNDERLYING TAX OBLIGATION, WHICH ALSO IS

RECORDED IN TAX EXPENSE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE CONTRACTS AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008 WAS $25 MILLION.

NET INVESTMENT HEDGING.

AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, THE COMPANY

USES CROSS CURRENCY SWAPS, FORWARDS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT TO

HEDGE PORTIONS OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. FOR

HEDGES THAT MEET THE EFFECTIVENESS REQUIREMENTS, THE NET GAINS OR LOSSES

ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN SPOT EXCHANGE RATES ARE RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE

TRANSLATION WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE REMAINDER OF THE CHANGE IN

VALUE OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS IS RECORDED IN EARNINGS.

DURING LATE 2007 AND EARLY 2008, THE COMPANY ENTERED

INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH AN AGGREGATE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF

$229 MILLION THAT WERE DESIGNATED AS A PARTIAL HEDGE OF THE COMPANYS NET

INVESTMENT IN ITS CHINESE SUBSIDIARIES. IN SEPTEMBER 2008, THE COMPANY

DE-DESIGNATED APPROXIMATELY $145 MILLION OF THESE HEDGES AND ENTERED INTO

OFFSETTING NON-HEDGE-DESIGNATED FORWARD CONTRACTS. SIMILAR ACTIONS WERE TAKEN

IN EARLY OCTOBER 2008 RELATIVE TO THE REMAINING NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF THESE

NET INVESTMENT HEDGES. ALL OF THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS MATURED IN DECEMBER 2008.

IN JULY AND DECEMBER 2007,

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 10, THE COMPANY ISSUED SEVEN-YEAR FIXED RATE EUROBOND

SECURITIES FOR AMOUNTS OF 750 MILLION EUROS AND 275 MILLION EUROS,

RESPECTIVELY. 3M DESIGNATED EACH OF THESE EUROBOND ISSUANCES AS HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES.

IN DECEMBER 2006,

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH A NOTIONAL

AMOUNT OF $556 MILLION RELATIVE TO THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS

EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES AND WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $209 MILLION RELATIVE

TO THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THESE FORWARDS

MATURED IN DECEMBER 2007.

IN NOVEMBER 2006,

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR FLOATING-TO-FLOATING CROSS CURRENCY SWAP

WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $200 MILLION. THIS TRANSACTION IS A PARTIAL HEDGE OF

THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES. THIS SWAP CONVERTS

U.S. DOLLAR-BASED VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS TO EURO-BASED VARIABLE INTEREST

PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR FLOATING-TO-FLOATING CROSS CURRENCY SWAP

WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $300 MILLION. THIS TRANSACTION IS A PARTIAL HEDGE OF

THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THIS SWAP CONVERTS

U.S. DOLLAR-BASED VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS TO YEN-BASED VARIABLE INTEREST

PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE UNREALIZED GAIN

RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION RELATED TO NET INVESTMENT HEDGING AT DECEMBER 31,

2008 WAS $44 MILLION. THE UNREALIZED LOSS RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION

RELATED TO NET INVESTMENT HEDGING AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS $28 MILLION.

CURRENCY

EFFECTS.

3M

ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR CURRENCY EFFECTS, INCLUDING HEDGING IMPACTS,

INCREASED NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION IN 2008, $150 MILLION IN

2007 AND $20 MILLION IN 2006. THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF TRANSLATING

PROFITS FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS; THE IMPACT OF CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF GOODS BETWEEN 3M OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED

STATES AND ABROAD; AND TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISKS OTHER THAN

INSTRUMENTS HEDGING FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS ON TAX OBLIGATIONS. 3M ESTIMATES

THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES INCREASED

NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION IN 2008, INCREASED NET INCOME BY

APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION IN 2007 AND HAD AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT ON NET INCOME IN

2006.

CREDIT RISK.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO CREDIT LOSS IN

THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES IN INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY

SWAPS, COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS, AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS. HOWEVER, THE

COMPANYS RISK IS LIMITED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY

ACTIVELY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH THE USE OF CREDIT

APPROVALS AND CREDIT LIMITS, AND BY SELECTING MAJOR INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE

NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF

2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENT WITH ONE OF ITS

PRIMARY DERIVATIVES COUNTERPARTIES. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EITHER PARTY IS

REQUIRED TO POST ELIGIBLE COLLATERAL WHEN THE MARKET VALUE OF TRANSACTIONS

COVERED BY THE AGREEMENT EXCEEDS SPECIFIED THRESHOLDS, THUS LIMITING CREDIT

EXPOSURE FOR BOTH PARTIES.

NOTE

13.  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1,

3M ADOPTED SFAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, (AS IMPACTED BY FSP

NOS. 157-1 AND 157-2) EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, WITH RESPECT TO FAIR

VALUE MEASUREMENTS OF (A) NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE

RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON

A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY) AND (B) ALL FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES.

UNDER SFAS NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE IS DEFINED AS THE EXIT PRICE, OR THE AMOUNT THAT WOULD BE RECEIVED

TO SELL AN ASSET OR PAID TO TRANSFER A LIABILITY IN AN ORDERLY TRANSACTION

BETWEEN MARKET PARTICIPANTS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. SFAS NO. 157 ALSO

ESTABLISHES A HIERARCHY FOR INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE THAT MAXIMIZES

THE USE OF OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND MINIMIZES THE USE OF UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS BY

REQUIRING THAT THE MOST OBSERVABLE INPUTS BE USED WHEN AVAILABLE. OBSERVABLE

INPUTS ARE INPUTS MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN VALUING THE ASSET OR

LIABILITY DEVELOPED BASED ON MARKET DATA OBTAINED FROM SOURCES INDEPENDENT OF

THE COMPANY. UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE INPUTS THAT REFLECT THE COMPANYS

ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE FACTORS MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN VALUING THE

ASSET OR LIABILITY DEVELOPED BASED UPON THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN THE

CIRCUMSTANCES. THE HIERARCHY IS BROKEN DOWN INTO THREE LEVELS. LEVEL 1 INPUTS

ARE QUOTED PRICES (UNADJUSTED) IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES. LEVEL 2 INPUTS INCLUDE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, AND INPUTS (OTHER THAN QUOTED

PRICES) THAT ARE OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY, EITHER DIRECTLY OR

INDIRECTLY. LEVEL 3 INPUTS ARE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THE ASSET OR LIABILITY.

CATEGORIZATION WITHIN THE VALUATION HIERARCHY IS BASED UPON THE LOWEST LEVEL OF

INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE

MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS.

AT 3M, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2008, FAIR VALUE UNDER SFAS NO. 157 (AS IMPACTED BY FSP NOS. 157-1 AND

157-2) PRINCIPALLY APPLIED TO FINANCIAL ASSET AND LIABILITIES SUCH AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS

(INCLUDED AS PART OF INVESTMENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET) AND CERTAIN

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. DERIVATIVES INCLUDE CASH FLOW HEDGES, INTEREST RATE

SWAPS AND MOST NET INVESTMENT HEDGES. THESE ITEMS WERE PREVIOUSLY AND WILL

CONTINUE TO BE MARKED-TO-MARKET AT EACH REPORTING PERIOD; HOWEVER, THE

DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE USED FOR THESE MARK-TO-MARKETS IS NOW APPLIED USING

SFAS NO. 157. THE INFORMATION IN THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS AND TABLES

PRIMARILY ADDRESSES MATTERS RELATIVE TO THESE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

THE INFORMATION INCORPORATES GUIDANCE OF FSP NO. 157-3, DETERMINING THE

FAIR VALUE OF A FINANCIAL ASSET WHEN THE MARKET FOR THAT ASSET IS NOT ACTIVE,

WHICH WAS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M BEGINNING WITH THE QUARTER ENDED SEPTEMBER 30,

2008. SEPARATELY, THERE WERE NO MATERIAL FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS WITH RESPECT

TO NONFINANCIAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR

VALUE IN THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS SUBSEQUENT TO

THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SFAS NO. 157 (AS IMPACTED BY FSP NOS. 157-1 AND 157-2).

3M USES VARIOUS VALUATION

TECHNIQUES, WHICH ARE PRIMARILY BASED UPON THE MARKET AND INCOME APPROACHES,

WITH RESPECT TO FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. FOLLOWING IS A DESCRIPTION OF

THE VALUATION METHODOLOGIES USED FOR THE RESPECTIVE FINANCIAL ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

MARKETABLE SECURITIES  EXCEPT AUCTION RATE SECURITIES.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES,

EXCEPT AUCTION RATE SECURITIES, ARE VALUED UTILIZING MULTIPLE SOURCES. A

WEIGHTED AVERAGE PRICE IS USED FOR THESE SECURITIES. MARKET PRICES ARE OBTAINED

FOR THESE SECURITIES FROM A VARIETY OF INDUSTRY STANDARD DATA PROVIDERS,

SECURITY MASTER FILES FROM LARGE FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS, AND OTHER THIRD-PARTY

SOURCES. THESE MULTIPLE PRICES ARE USED AS INPUTS INTO A

DISTRIBUTION-CURVE-BASED ALGORITHM TO DETERMINE THE DAILY FAIR VALUE TO BE

USED. 3M CLASSIFIES TREASURY SECURITIES AS LEVEL 1, WHILE ALL OTHER MARKETABLE

SECURITIES (EXCLUDING AUCTION RATE SECURITIES) ARE CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2.

MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 9.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

MARKETABLE SECURITIES  AUCTION RATE SECURITIES ONLY.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 9,

AUCTION RATE SECURITIES HELD BY 3M FAILED TO AUCTION DURING THE SECOND HALF OF

2007 AND ALL FOUR QUARTERS IN 2008. AS A RESULT, INVESTMENTS IN AUCTION RATE

SECURITIES ARE VALUED UTILIZING BROKER-DEALER VALUATION MODELS AND THIRD-PARTY

INDICATIVE BID LEVELS IN MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE. 3M CLASSIFIES THESE

SECURITIES AS LEVEL 3.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS INCLUDE

EQUITY SECURITIES THAT ARE TRADED IN AN ACTIVE MARKET. CLOSING STOCK PRICES ARE

READILY AVAILABLE FROM ACTIVE MARKETS AND ARE USED AS BEING REPRESENTATIVE OF

FAIR VALUE. 3M CLASSIFIES THESE SECURITIES AS LEVEL 1.

CERTAIN DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS.

DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES WITHIN THE SCOPE OF SFAS NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE.

THE COMPANYS DERIVATIVES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY SFAS NO. 157 INCLUDE

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS, COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS, INTEREST

RATE SWAPS, AND NET INVESTMENT HEDGES WHERE THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS RECORDED

AT FAIR VALUE. NET INVESTMENT HEDGES THAT USE FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT

TO HEDGE 3MS NET INVESTMENT ARE NOT IMPACTED BY SFAS NO. 157 AS THE DEBT

USED AS THE HEDGING INSTRUMENT IS MARKED TO A VALUE WITH RESPECT TO CHANGES IN

SPOT FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND NOT WITH RESPECT TO OTHER FACTORS THAT

MAY IMPACT FAIR VALUE.

3M HAS DETERMINED THAT

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARDS AND COMMODITY HEDGES WILL BE CONSIDERED LEVEL 1

MEASUREMENTS AS THESE ARE TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS WHICH HAVE IDENTICAL ASSET

OR LIABILITIES, WHILE CURRENCY SWAPS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE OPTIONS, INTEREST RATE

SWAPS AND CROSS-CURRENCY INTEREST RATE SWAPS WILL BE CONSIDERED LEVEL 2. FOR

LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVES, 3M USES INPUTS OTHER THAN QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE

OBSERVABLE FOR THE ASSET. THESE INPUTS INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES,

VOLATILITIES, AND INTEREST RATES. THE LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVE POSITIONS ARE

PRIMARILY VALUED USING STANDARD CALCULATIONS/MODELS THAT USE AS THEIR BASIS

READILY OBSERVABLE MARKET PARAMETERS. INDUSTRY STANDARD DATA PROVIDERS ARE 3MS

PRIMARY SOURCE FOR FORWARD AND SPOT RATE INFORMATION FOR BOTH INTEREST RATES

AND CURRENCY RATES, WITH RESULTING VALUATIONS PERIODICALLY VALIDATED THROUGH

THIRD-PARTY OR COUNTERPARTY QUOTES AND A NET PRESENT VALUE STREAM OF CASH FLOWS

2008, THE COMPANY REMEASURED THE PLAN ASSETS OF ITS U.S. POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFITS PLAN IN CONNECTION WITH A CHANGE IN THE BENEFITS PROVIDED BY THIS

PLAN. AS REQUIRED BY FAS 158, 3MS DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

PLANS ASSETS WERE ALSO MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

REFER TO NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION CONCERNING PENSION AND

FAIR

VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2008

AND 2007, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE, BORROWINGS, AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT (EXCEPT THE $350 MILLION DEALER

REMARKETABLE SECURITY) APPROXIMATED CARRYING VALUES BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM

NATURE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES AND

INVESTMENTS, IN ADDITION TO CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, ARE RECORDED AT

FAIR VALUES AS INDICATED IN THE PRECEDING DISCLOSURES. FAIR VALUES FOR

INVESTMENTS HELD AT COST ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE, BUT ARE ESTIMATED TO

APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY UTILIZED THIRD-PARTY QUOTES TO ESTIMATE

FAIR VALUES FOR ITS DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES AND LONG-TERM DEBT. THE

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE

MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS.

DURING 2008, THE COMPANY

HAD NO SIGNIFICANT MEASUREMENTS OF ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE (AS

DEFINED IN SFAS NO. 157) ON A NONRECURRING BASIS SUBSEQUENT TO THEIR

INITIAL RECOGNITION. AS INDICATED IN NOTE 1, THE ASPECTS OF SFAS NO. 157

FOR WHICH THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR 3M WAS DEFERRED UNDER FSP NO. 157-2 UNTIL

JANUARY 1, 2009 RELATE TO NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE

MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE, BUT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE ON A

NONRECURRING BASIS. THIS DEFERRAL APPLIES TO SUCH ITEMS AS NONFINANCIAL ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES INITIALLY MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION (BUT

NOT MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS) OR NONFINANCIAL LONG-LIVED

ASSET GROUPS MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE FOR AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT. DURING 2008,

SUCH MEASUREMENTS OF FAIR VALUE IMPACTED BY THE DEFERRAL UNDER FSP NO. 157-2

RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITH RESPECT TO

THE BUSINESS COMBINATIONS IN 2008 AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2 AND THE PORTION OF

CAPITAL

AND OPERATING LEASES.

RENTAL EXPENSE UNDER

OPERATING LEASES WAS $247 MILLION IN 2008, $226 MILLION IN 2007, AND $211

MILLION IN 2006. IT IS 3MS PRACTICE TO SECURE RENEWAL RIGHTS FOR LEASES,

THEREBY GIVING 3M THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO MAINTAIN A PRESENCE IN

A LEASED FACILITY. 3MS PRIMARY CAPITAL LEASE, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN APRIL 2003,

INVOLVES A BUILDING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (WITH A LEASE TERM OF 22 YEARS).

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, 3M RECORDED A CAPITAL LEASE ASSET AND

OBLIGATION OF APPROXIMATELY 33.5 MILLION UNITED KINGDOM POUNDS (APPROXIMATELY

$47 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2008 EXCHANGE RATES). MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS

UNDER CAPITAL AND OPERATING LEASES WITH NON-CANCELABLE TERMS IN EXCESS OF ONE

WARRANTIES/GUARANTEES.

3MS ACCRUED PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITIES, RECORDED ON

THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS PART OF CURRENT AND LONG-TERM LIABILITIES,

ARE ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY $25 MILLION AND $21 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2008 AND 2007. 3M DOES NOT CONSIDER THIS AMOUNT TO BE

MATERIAL. THE FAIR VALUE OF 3M GUARANTEES OF LOANS WITH THIRD PARTIES AND OTHER

GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS, EXCEPT FOR THE GUARANTEE DISCUSSED BELOW, ARE NOT

MATERIAL.

3M SECURITY PRINTING AND

SYSTEMS LIMITED, A SUBSIDIARY OF 3M, HAS PROVIDED A GUARANTEE THROUGH 3M UNITED

KINGDOM HOLDINGS PLC (ANOTHER SUBSIDIARY OF 3M) TO THE IDENTITY AND PASSPORT

SERVICE (IPS). 3M HAS GUARANTEED DEFAULT ON PERFORMANCE AND PAYMENT OF

LIABILITIES UNDER A CONTRACT WITH IPS. THE AMOUNT GUARANTEED IS 45 MILLION

GREAT BRITISH POUNDS (APPROXIMATELY $65 MILLION U.S. DOLLARS AT DECEMBER 31,

2008). THE CONTRACT EXPIRES ON OCTOBER 4, 2010. 3M DOES NOT EXPECT TO PAY

OUT ANY FUNDS UNDER THIS GUARANTEE.

RELATED PARTY ACTIVITY.

3M DOES NOT HAVE ANY

RELATED PARTY ACTIVITY THAT IS NOT IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY AND

SOME OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS,

PRINCIPALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS WORLDWIDE. THESE

INCLUDE VARIOUS PRODUCTS LIABILITY (INVOLVING PRODUCTS THAT THE COMPANY NOW OR

FORMERLY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD), INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND COMMERCIAL CLAIMS

AND LAWSUITS, INCLUDING THOSE BROUGHT UNDER THE ANTITRUST LAWS, AND

ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS FIRST DESCRIBE THE

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED, AND THEN

DESCRIBE THE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES THE COMPANY HAS

ACCRUED RELATING TO ITS SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED,

THE COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ALL SUCH LITIGATION.

SHAREHOLDER

DERIVATIVE LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, IN JULY 2007, A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUIT WAS FILED IN THE

U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE AGAINST THE COMPANY AS NOMINAL

DEFENDANT AND AGAINST EACH THEN CURRENT MEMBER OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

THE OFFICERS NAMED IN THE SUMMARY COMPENSATION TABLE OF THE 2007 PROXY

STATEMENT. THE SUIT ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANYS 2007 PROXY STATEMENT CONTAINED

FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF

COMPENSATION PAYABLE UNDER THE EXECUTIVE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN (PLAN) AND THE

STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE PLAN. THE LAWSUIT SEEKS

A DECLARATION VOIDING SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE PLAN, TERMINATION OF THE

PLAN, VOIDING THE ELECTIONS OF DIRECTORS, EQUITABLE ACCOUNTING, AND AWARDING

COSTS, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES.

IN MAY 2008,

THE COMPANY AND THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS AGREED TO SETTLE THE LITIGATION

WITHOUT ADMITTING ANY LIABILITY OR WRONGDOING OF ANY KIND. THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT, WHICH IS SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL, CALLS FOR THE COMPENSATION

84

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMITTEE OF THE

COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS TO ADOPT A RESOLUTION FORMALLY STATING ITS

INTERPRETATION OF CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE PLAN, AND THE COMPANY TO ISSUE A PRESS

RELEASE TO THE SAME EFFECT, AND TO PAY UP TO $600,000 IN ATTORNEYS FEES TO THE

PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL. ON DECEMBER 30, 2008, THE COURT ISSUED AN ORDER PRELIMINARILY APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY WILL NOTIFY ALL STOCKHOLDERS OF THE

PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AND ITS TERMS AND THEIR RIGHT TO OBJECT TO THE TERMS OF THE

SETTLEMENT. THE COURT ALSO SCHEDULED A FINAL HEARING FOR MAY 21, 2009 FOR

THE PURPOSE OF FINALLY DETERMINING WHETHER THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT IS

FAIR, REASONABLE AND ADEQUATE. THE SETTLEMENT WILL BE CONSUMMATED AFTER A FINAL

ORDER APPROVING THE SETTLEMENT.

FRENCH

COMPETITION COUNCIL INVESTIGATION

ON DECEMBER 4, 2008, THE COMPANYS SUBSIDIARY IN FRANCE RECEIVED A

STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS FROM THE FRENCH COMPETITION COUNCIL ALLEGING AN ABUSE

OF A DOMINANT POSITION REGARDING THE SUPPLY OF RETRO-REFLECTIVE FILMS FOR

VERTICAL SIGNING APPLICATIONS IN FRANCE AND OF PARTICIPATION IN A CONCERTED

PRACTICE WITH THE MAJOR FRENCH MANUFACTURERS OF VERTICAL SIGNS. THE STATEMENT

OF OBJECTIONS IS AN INTERMEDIATE STAGE IN THE PROCEEDINGS AND NO FINAL

DETERMINATION REGARDING AN INFRINGEMENT OF FRENCH COMPETITION RULES HAS

BEEN MADE. 3M WILL FILE A RESPONSE IN DUE COURSE DENYING THAT THE STATEMENT OF

OBJECTIONS STATES ANY VALID CLAIM AGAINST 3M. IT IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THE

FINAL OUTCOME OF THE INVESTIGATION AT THIS TIME.

BREAST IMPLANT

LITIGATION

THE COMPANY AND

CERTAIN OTHER COMPANIES WERE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN PAST YEARS IN NUMEROUS

CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS ALLEGING DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES OF VARIOUS TYPES

RESULTING FROM BREAST IMPLANTS FORMERLY MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY OR A

RELATED COMPANY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY HAVE BEEN

RESOLVED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER ITS REMAINING PROBABLE LIABILITY TO BE

MATERIAL. INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ASSOCIATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLE AND LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO IT FOLLOWS IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED

BREAST IMPLANT LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION

FOR MORE THAN 25

YEARS THE COMPANY HAS DEFENDED AND RESOLVED THE CLAIMS OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS

OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS ALLEGING INJURIES FROM OCCUPATIONAL DUST EXPOSURES. AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY IS A NAMED DEFENDANT, WITH MULTIPLE

CO-DEFENDANTS, IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS IN VARIOUS COURTS THAT PURPORT TO REPRESENT

APPROXIMATELY 2,700 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS, A DECREASE FROM THE APPROXIMATELY

8,750 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS WITH ACTIONS PENDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2007.

THE VAST MAJORITY

OF THE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RESOLVED BY AND CURRENTLY PENDING AGAINST THE

COMPANY ALLEGE USE OF SOME OF THE COMPANYS MASK AND RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND

SEEK DAMAGES FROM THE COMPANY AND OTHER DEFENDANTS FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY

FROM WORKPLACE EXPOSURES TO ASBESTOS, SILICA, COAL OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS

FOUND IN PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS OR GENERALLY IN THE

WORKPLACE. A MINORITY OF CLAIMANTS GENERALLY ALLEGE PERSONAL INJURY FROM

OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS FROM PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY MANUFACTURED BY THE

COMPANY, WHICH ARE OFTEN UNSPECIFIED, AS WELL AS PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY OTHER

DEFENDANTS, OR OCCASIONALLY AT COMPANY PREMISES.

IN MANY OF THESE

LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE COMPANY IS NAMED AS A DEFENDANT WITH MULTIPLE

CO-DEFENDANTS WHERE NO PRODUCT THE COMPANY MANUFACTURED IS IDENTIFIED OR WHERE

THE COMPANY IS ULTIMATELY DETERMINED NOT TO HAVE MANUFACTURED THE PRODUCTS

IDENTIFIED BY THE PLAINTIFFS. THE COMPANYS VIGOROUS DEFENSE OF THIS LITIGATION

HAS RESULTED IN DISMISSALS OF MANY CLAIMS WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT BY THE COMPANY,

AND JURY VERDICTS FOR THE COMPANY IN SEVEN OF THE EIGHT CASES TRIED TO VERDICT

(SUCH TRIALS OCCURRED IN 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004 AND 2007), AND AN APPELLATE

REVERSAL IN 2005 OF THE ONE JURY VERDICT ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY.

SINCE APPROXIMATELY

2006, THE COMPANY HAS EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF NEW

CLAIMS FILED ANNUALLY BY APPARENTLY UNIMPAIRED CLAIMANTS. THE COMPANY

ATTRIBUTES THIS DECLINE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING CERTAIN CHANGES ENACTED

IN SEVERAL STATES IN RECENT YEARS OF THE LAW GOVERNING ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS,

AND THE HIGHLY-PUBLICIZED DECISION IN MID-2005 OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS THAT IDENTIFIED AND CRITICIZED ABUSES

BY CERTAIN ATTORNEYS, DOCTORS AND X-RAY SCREENING COMPANIES ON BEHALF OF

PRIMARILY UNIMPAIRED CLAIMANTS, MANY OF WHOM WERE RECRUITED BY PLAINTIFFS

LAWYERS THROUGH MASS CHEST X-RAY SCREENINGS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE FILING OF

CLAIMS BY UNIMPAIRED CLAIMANTS IN THE FUTURE TO CONTINUE AT MUCH LOWER LEVELS

THAN IN THE PAST. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT DUE TO THIS CHANGE IN THE TYPE AND

VOLUME OF INCOMING CLAIMS, IT IS LIKELY THAT THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS ALLEGING MORE

SERIOUS INJURIES, INCLUDING MESOTHELIOMA AND OTHER MALIGNANCIES, WHILE

REMAINING RELATIVELY CONSTANT, WILL REPRESENT A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL

CLAIMS THAN IN THE PAST. THE COMPANY HAS DEMONSTRATED IN PAST TRIAL PROCEEDINGS

THAT ITS RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS ARE EFFECTIVE AS CLAIMED WHEN USED IN

THE INTENDED MANNER AND IN THE INTENDED CIRCUMSTANCES. CONSEQUENTLY THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT CLAIMANTS ARE UNABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT THEIR MEDICAL CONDITIONS,

EVEN IF SIGNIFICANT, ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANYS RESPIRATORY PROTECTION

PRODUCTS. NONETHELESS THE COMPANYS LITIGATION EXPERIENCE INDICATES THAT CLAIMS

OF PERSONS WITH MALIGNANT CONDITIONS ARE COSTLIER TO RESOLVE THAN THE CLAIMS OF

UNIMPAIRED PERSONS, AND IT THEREFORE ANTICIPATES AN INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE

COST OF RESOLVING PENDING AND FUTURE CLAIMS ON A PER-CLAIM BASIS THAN IT EXPERIENCED

IN PRIOR PERIODS WHEN THE VAST MAJORITY OF CLAIMS WERE ASSERTED BY THE

UNIMPAIRED.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE

ASSERTED SPECIFIC DOLLAR CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES IN APPROXIMATELY 37 PERCENT OF THE

1,013 LAWSUITS THAT WERE PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY AT THE END OF 2008 IN ALL

JURISDICTIONS. A MAJORITY OF STATES RESTRICT OR PROHIBIT SPECIFYING

85

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DAMAGES IN TORT

CASES SUCH AS THESE, AND MOST OF THE REMAINING JURISDICTIONS DO NOT REQUIRE

SUCH SPECIFICATION. IN THOSE CASES IN WHICH PLAINTIFFS CHOOSE TO ASSERT

SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THEIR COMPLAINTS, BROUGHT IN STATES THAT PERMIT SUCH

PLEADING, THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED ARE TYPICALLY NOT MEANINGFUL AS AN INDICATOR OF

THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY. THIS IS BECAUSE (A) THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED

TYPICALLY BEAR NO RELATION TO THE EXTENT OF THE PLAINTIFFS INJURY, IF ANY; (B) THE

COMPLAINTS NEARLY ALWAYS ASSERT CLAIMS AGAINST MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS WITH THE

TYPICAL COMPLAINT ASSERTING CLAIMS AGAINST AS FEW AS A DOZEN DIFFERENT

DEFENDANTS TO UPWARDS OF 275 DIFFERENT DEFENDANTS, THE DAMAGES ALLEGED ARE NOT

ATTRIBUTED TO INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS, AND A DEFENDANTS SHARE OF LIABILITY MAY

TURN ON THE LAW OF JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY, WHICH CAN VARY BY STATE, AND BY

THE AMOUNT OF FAULT A JURY ALLOCATES TO EACH DEFENDANT IF A CASE IS ULTIMATELY

TRIED BEFORE A JURY; (C) MANY CASES ARE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY EVEN

THOUGH THE PLAINTIFFS DID NOT USE ANY OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND,

ULTIMATELY, ARE WITHDRAWN OR DISMISSED WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT; AND (D) MANY

CASES ARE BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFFS WHO HAVE NOT SUFFERED ANY MEDICAL

INJURY, AND, ULTIMATELY, ARE RESOLVED WITHOUT ANY PAYMENT OR A PAYMENT THAT IS

A SMALL FRACTION OF THE DAMAGES INITIALLY CLAIMED. OF THE 375 PENDING CASES IN

WHICH PURPORTED DAMAGE AMOUNTS ARE SPECIFIED IN THE COMPLAINTS, 230 CASES

INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $100,000 OR LESS, (THIRTEEN (13) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGES

PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $7,000, THREE (3) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE

DAMAGES OF $1 MILLION, AND SIX (6) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES

OF $20 MILLION); 102 CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS BETWEEN $100,000 AND $3 MILLION

(FORTY-SEVEN (47) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $250,000, ONE (1) OF

WHICH ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $1 MILLION, THIRTY-SIX (36) OF WHICH

ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $1.5 MILLION, AND ONE (1) OF WHICH ALSO

ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $2 MILLION); FIVE (5) CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF

$3 MILLION TO $7.5 MILLION (ONE (1) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES

OF $350,000, ONE (1) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $5 MILLION,

AND ONE (1) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $25 MILLION);

SEVEN (7) CASES

INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $7.5 MILLION TO $10 MILLION (THREE (3) OF WHICH ALSO

ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $5 MILLION AND FOUR (4) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE

PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $21 MILLION); THIRTEEN (13) CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $10

MILLION (ONE (1) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $5 MILLION, SIX

(6) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $10 MILLION, AND ONE (1) OF

WHICH ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $15 MILLION); FOURTEEN (14) CASES

INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $10 MILLION TO $50 MILLION (ONE (1) OF WHICH ALSO

ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $5 MILLION, THREE (3) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE

PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $15 MILLION, FIVE (5) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE

DAMAGES OF $15.5 MILLION, AND TWO (2) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE

DAMAGES OF $20 MILLION); AND FOUR (4) CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $50 MILLION

(TWO (2) OF WHICH ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $50 MILLION). SOME

COMPLAINTS ALLEGE THAT THE COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE AT LEAST THE

AMOUNTS SPECIFIED. AS PREVIOUSLY STATED, THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE AND THE OTHER

REASONS CITED INDICATE THAT THE DAMAGE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED IN COMPLAINTS ARE NOT

A MEANINGFUL FACTOR IN ANY ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY.

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA, THROUGH ITS ATTORNEY GENERAL, FILED A

COMPLAINT IN 2003 AGAINST THE COMPANY AND TWO OTHER MANUFACTURERS OF

RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF LINCOLN COUNTY, WEST

VIRGINIA AND AMENDED IT IN 2005. THE AMENDED COMPLAINT SEEKS SUBSTANTIAL, BUT

UNSPECIFIED, COMPENSATORY DAMAGES PRIMARILY FOR REIMBURSEMENT OF THE COSTS

ALLEGEDLY INCURRED BY THE STATE FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION AND HEALTHCARE

BENEFITS PROVIDED TO ALL WORKERS WITH OCCUPATIONAL PNEUMOCONIOSIS AND

UNSPECIFIED PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION  AEARO TECHNOLOGIES

ON APRIL 1,

2008, A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY PURCHASED THE STOCK OF AEARO HOLDING CORP.,

THE PARENT OF AEARO TECHNOLOGIES (AEARO). AEARO MANUFACTURES AND SELLS

VARIOUS PRODUCTS, INCLUDING PERSONAL PROTECTION EQUIPMENT, SUCH AS EYE, EAR,

HEAD, FACE, FALL AND RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, AEARO AND/OR OTHER COMPANIES THAT PREVIOUSLY OWNED AND OPERATED AEAROS

RESPIRATOR BUSINESS (AMERICAN OPTICAL CORPORATION, WARNER-LAMBERT LLC, AO CORP.

AND CABOT CORPORATION (CABOT)) ARE NAMED DEFENDANTS, WITH MULTIPLE CO-DEFENDANTS,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY, IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS IN VARIOUS COURTS IN WHICH

PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE USE OF MASK AND RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND SEEK DAMAGES FROM

AEARO AND OTHER DEFENDANTS FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY FROM WORKPLACE EXPOSURES

TO ASBESTOS, SILICA-RELATED, OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS FOUND IN PRODUCTS

MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS OR GENERALLY IN THE WORKPLACE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, THE COMPANY, THROUGH ITS AEARO SUBSIDIARY, HAS RECORDED $35 MILLION AS AN

ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABLE LIABILITIES FOR PRODUCT LIABILITIES AND DEFENSE COSTS

RELATED TO CURRENT AND FUTURE AEARO-RELATED ASBESTOS AND SILICA-RELATED CLAIMS.

RESPONSIBILITY FOR LEGAL COSTS, AS WELL AS FOR SETTLEMENTS AND JUDGMENTS, IS

CURRENTLY SHARED IN AN INFORMAL ARRANGEMENT AMONG AEARO, CABOT, AMERICAN

OPTICAL CORPORATION AND A SUBSIDIARY OF WARNER LAMBERT AND THEIR INSURERS (THE PAYOR

GROUP). LIABILITY IS ALLOCATED AMONG THE PARTIES BASED ON THE NUMBER OF YEARS

EACH COMPANY SOLD RESPIRATORY PRODUCTS UNDER THE AO SAFETY BRAND AND/OR OWNED

THE AO SAFETY DIVISION OF AMERICAN OPTICAL CORPORATION AND THE ALLEGED YEARS OF

EXPOSURE OF THE INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFF. AEAROS SHARE OF THE CONTINGENT LIABILITY

IS FURTHER LIMITED BY AN AGREEMENT ENTERED INTO BETWEEN AEARO AND CABOT ON JULY 11,

1995. THIS AGREEMENT PROVIDES THAT, SO LONG AS AEARO PAYS TO CABOT AN ANNUAL

FEE OF $400,000, CABOT WILL RETAIN RESPONSIBILITY AND LIABILITY FOR, AND

INDEMNIFY AEARO AGAINST, ASBESTOS AND SILICA-RELATED PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS

FOR RESPIRATORS MANUFACTURED PRIOR TO JULY 11, 1995. BECAUSE THE DATE OF

MANUFACTURE FOR A PARTICULAR RESPIRATOR ALLEGEDLY USED IN THE PAST IS OFTEN

DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE, AEARO AND CABOT HAVE APPLIED THE AGREEMENT TO CLAIMS

ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF RESPIRATORS WHILE EXPOSED TO ASBESTOS OR SILICA OR

PRODUCTS CONTAINING ASBESTOS OR SILICA PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 1997. WITH

THESE ARRANGEMENTS IN PLACE, AEAROS POTENTIAL LIABILITY IS LIMITED TO

EXPOSURES ALLEGED TO HAVE ARISEN FROM THE USE OF RESPIRATORS WHILE EXPOSED TO

ASBESTOS, SILICA OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 1997.

86

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO DATE, AEARO HAS

ELECTED TO PAY THE ANNUAL FEE. AEARO COULD POTENTIALLY BE EXPOSED TO ADDITIONAL

CLAIMS FOR SOME PART OF THE PRE-JULY 11, 1995 PERIOD COVERED BY ITS

AGREEMENT WITH CABOT IF AEARO ELECTS TO DISCONTINUE ITS PARTICIPATION IN THIS

ARRANGEMENT, OR IF CABOT IS NO LONGER ABLE TO MEET ITS OBLIGATIONS IN THESE

MATTERS.

DEVELOPMENTS MAY

OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE ESTIMATE OF AEAROS LIABILITIES. THESE DEVELOPMENTS

INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO: (I) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF

FUTURE CLAIMS, (II) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS,

(III) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE LEGAL COSTS OF DEFENDING THESE CLAIMS, (IV) SIGNIFICANT

CHANGES IN THE MIX AND NATURE OF CLAIMS RECEIVED, (V) TRIAL AND APPELLATE

OUTCOMES, (VI) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE LAW AND PROCEDURE APPLICABLE TO

THESE CLAIMS, (VII) SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE LIABILITY ALLOCATION AMONG

THE CO-DEFENDANTS, (VIII) THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF MEMBERS OF THE PAYOR

GROUP INCLUDING EXHAUSTION OF AVAILABLE COVERAGE LIMITS, (IX) THE OUTCOME

OF PENDING INSURANCE COVERAGE LITIGATION AMONG CERTAIN OTHER MEMBERS OF THE

PAYOR GROUP AND THEIR RESPECTIVE INSURERS, AND/OR (X) A DETERMINATION THAT

THE INTERPRETATION OF THE CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS ON WHICH AEARO HAS ESTIMATED

ITS SHARE OF LIABILITY IS INACCURATE. THE COMPANY CANNOT DETERMINE THE IMPACT

OF THESE POTENTIAL DEVELOPMENTS ON ITS CURRENT ESTIMATE OF AEAROS SHARE OF

LIABILITY FOR THESE EXISTING AND FUTURE CLAIMS. IF ANY OF THE DEVELOPMENTS

DESCRIBED ABOVE WERE TO OCCUR, THE ACTUAL AMOUNT OF THESE LIABILITIES FOR

EXISTING AND FUTURE CLAIMS COULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER THAN THE RESERVED

AMOUNT.

EMPLOYMENT

LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, ONE CURRENT AND ONE FORMER EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY FILED A PURPORTED

CLASS ACTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF RAMSEY COUNTY, MINNESOTA, IN DECEMBER 2004,

SEEKING TO REPRESENT A CLASS OF ALL CURRENT AND CERTAIN FORMER SALARIED

EMPLOYEES EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY IN MINNESOTA BELOW A CERTAIN SALARY GRADE WHO

WERE AGE 46 OR OLDER AT ANY TIME DURING THE APPLICABLE PERIOD TO BE DETERMINED

BY THE COURT (THE WHITAKER LAWSUIT). THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THE PLAINTIFFS

SUFFERED VARIOUS FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF AGE IN

VIOLATION OF THE MINNESOTA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT AND SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,

UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES (WHICH THEY SEEK TO TREBLE UNDER THE STATUTE),

INCLUDING BACK AND FRONT PAY, PUNITIVE DAMAGES (LIMITED BY STATUTE TO $8,500

PER CLAIMANT) AND ATTORNEYS FEES. IN JANUARY 2006, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED A

MOTION TO JOIN FOUR ADDITIONAL NAMED PLAINTIFFS. THIS MOTION WAS UNOPPOSED BY

THE COMPANY AND THE FOUR PLAINTIFFS WERE JOINED IN THE CASE, ALTHOUGH ONE CLAIM

HAS BEEN DISMISSED FOLLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL SETTLEMENT. THE CLASS CERTIFICATION

HEARING WAS HELD IN DECEMBER 2007. ON APRIL 11, 2008, THE COURT

GRANTED THE PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO CERTIFY THE CASE AS A CLASS ACTION AND

DEFINED THE CLASS AS ALL PERSONS WHO WERE 46 OR OLDER WHEN EMPLOYED BY 3M IN

MINNESOTA IN A SALARIED EXEMPT POSITION BELOW A CERTAIN SALARY GRADE AT ANY

TIME ON OR AFTER MAY 10, 2003, AND WHO DID NOT SIGN A DOCUMENT ON THEIR

LAST DAY OF EMPLOYMENT PURPORTING TO RELEASE CLAIMS ARISING OUT OF THEIR

EMPLOYMENT WITH 3M. ON JUNE 25, 2008, THE MINNESOTA COURT OF APPEALS

GRANTED THE COMPANYS PETITION FOR INTERLOCUTORY REVIEW OF THE DISTRICT COURTS

DECISION GRANTING CLASS CERTIFICATION IN THE CASE. THE COURT OF APPEALS HEARD

ARGUMENT IN THE CASE ON FEBRUARY 4, 2009. UNDER MINNESOTA RULES, THE COURT

HAS 90 DAYS TO ISSUE A RULING. WHILE THE APPEAL IS PENDING, ALL OTHER ACTIVITY

ON THE CASE IS STAYED. NO TRIAL DATE OR CALENDAR OF PRETRIAL PROCEEDINGS HAS

BEEN SET AT THIS TIME.

A SIMILAR AGE

DISCRIMINATION LAWSUIT BY A SINGLE FORMER EMPLOYEE WAS FILED IN THE DISTRICT

COURT OF RAMSEY COUNTY, MINNESOTA. AS IN THE WHITAKER LAWSUIT, THE PLAINTIFF

CLAIMS HE WAS SUBJECT TO AGE DISCRIMINATION IN VIOLATION OF THE MINNESOTA HUMAN

RIGHTS ACT (MHRA). HE IS ALSO CLAIMING HE EXPERIENCED GENDER DISCRIMINATION

IN VIOLATION OF THE MHRA. THE PLAINTIFF SEEKS UNSPECIFIED MONETARY DAMAGES,

INCLUDING AN AWARD EQUAL TO THREE TIMES HIS LOST SALARY AND BENEFITS, DAMAGES

FOR EMOTIONAL AND MENTAL DISTRESS, PUNITIVE DAMAGES (LIMITED BY STATUTE TO

$8,500) AND ATTORNEYS FEES. HE ALSO SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THE CASE IS

ASSIGNED FOR TRIAL BEFORE THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE WHO CERTIFIED THE CLASS IN

THE WHITAKER LAWSUIT AND IS SET FOR TRIAL IN LATE MARCH OR EARLY APRIL 2009.

IN ADDITION, THREE

FORMER EMPLOYEES FILED AGE DISCRIMINATION CHARGES AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH THE

U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND THE PERTINENT STATE AGENCIES

IN MINNESOTA, TEXAS AND CALIFORNIA DURING 2005. SUCH FILINGS INCLUDE

ALLEGATIONS THAT THE RELEASE OF CLAIMS SIGNED BY CERTAIN FORMER EMPLOYEES IN

THE PURPORTED CLASS DEFINED IN THE CHARGES IS INVALID FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND

ASSERT AGE DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER

SALARIED EMPLOYEES IN STATES OTHER THAN MINNESOTA AND NEW JERSEY. IN 2006, ONE

CURRENT EMPLOYEE FILED AN AGE DISCRIMINATION CHARGE AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH

THE U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND THE PERTINENT STATE AGENCY

IN MISSOURI, ASSERTING CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OF ALL CURRENT AND CERTAIN

FORMER SALARIED EMPLOYEES WHO WORKED IN MISSOURI AND OTHER STATES OTHER THAN

MINNESOTA AND NEW JERSEY. IN 2007, A FORMER EMPLOYEE FILED AN AGE

DISCRIMINATION CHARGE AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH THE U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT

OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND THE PERTINENT STATE AGENCY IN CALIFORNIA, ASSERTING

CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OF ALL CURRENT AND CERTAIN FORMER SALARIED

EMPLOYEES WHO WORKED IN CALIFORNIA. ALTHOUGH THE CLAIM WAS FILED IN 2007, IT

WAS NOT SERVED ON THE COMPANY UNTIL OCTOBER 2008, WHICH WAS THE COMPANYS

FIRST NOTICE OF THE CHARGE. THE SAME LAW FIRM REPRESENTS THE PLAINTIFFS IN THE

WHITAKER LAWSUIT AS WELL AS THE CLAIMANTS IN EACH OF THESE EEOC PROCEEDINGS.

ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS AND LITIGATION

THE COMPANYS

OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS INCLUDING THOSE

PERTAINING TO AIR EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER DISCHARGES, TOXIC SUBSTANCES, AND THE

HANDLING AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTES ENFORCEABLE BY NATIONAL,

STATE, AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AROUND THE WORLD, AND PRIVATE PARTIES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS PROVIDE, UNDER CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, A BASIS FOR THE REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATION AND FOR PERSONAL

INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS. THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED, AND WILL CONTINUE

TO INCUR, COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN COMPLYING WITH THESE LAWS AND

REGULATIONS, DEFENDING PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS, AND

MODIFYING ITS

87

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BUSINESS

OPERATIONS IN LIGHT OF ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES. IN ITS EFFORT TO

SATISFY ITS ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

AND REGULATIONS, THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED, AND PERIODICALLY UPDATES,

POLICIES RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR ITS OPERATIONS

WORLDWIDE.

REMEDIATION

: UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS,

INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION

AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980 AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY MAY BE JOINTLY

AND SEVERALLY LIABLE, TYPICALLY WITH OTHER COMPANIES, FOR THE COSTS OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AT CURRENT OR FORMER FACILITIES AND AT OFF-SITE

LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS LOCATIONS, MOST OF WHICH ARE IN

THE UNITED STATES, AT WHICH IT MAY HAVE SOME LIABILITY. PLEASE REFER TO THE ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION LIABILITIES IN THE TABLE IN THE FOLLOWING SECTION, 

ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS,

 FOR INFORMATION ON THE AMOUNT OF THE RESERVE.

REGULATORY

ACTIVITIES

: AS

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY HAS BEEN VOLUNTARILY COOPERATING WITH ONGOING

REVIEWS BY LOCAL, STATE, NATIONAL (PRIMARILY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION

AGENCY (EPA)), AND INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES OF POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH

EFFECTS OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS (PFCS) (PERFLUROOCTANOIC ACID OR PFOA

AND PERFLUOROOCTANE SULFONATE OR PFOS) AND RELATED COMPOUNDS. AS A RESULT OF

ITS PHASE-OUT DECISION IN MAY 2000, THE COMPANY NO LONGER MANUFACTURES

PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS, EXCEPT THAT A SUBSIDIARY RECOVERS AND RECYCLES PFOA

IN GENDORF, GERMANY, FOR INTERNAL USE IN PRODUCTION PROCESSES AND HAS AGREED TO

A PRODUCT STEWARDSHIP INITIATIVE WITH THE EPA TO END ITS USE OF PFOA BY 2015.

REGULATORY ACTIVITIES

CONCERNING PFOA AND/OR PFOS CONTINUE IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, AND BEFORE

CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL BODIES. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE GATHERING OF EXPOSURE

AND USE INFORMATION, RISK ASSESSMENT, AND CONSIDERATION OF REGULATORY

APPROACHES. IN DECEMBER 2006, THE EUROPEAN UNION ADOPTED AN AMENDMENT TO

THE MARKETING AND USE DIRECTIVE TO LIMIT USE OF PFOS. MEMBER STATES WERE REQUIRED TO ENACT THE DIRECTIVE INTO NATIONAL LAW BY DECEMBER 27,

2007 WITH AN EFFECTIVE DATE OF JUNE 27, 2008.

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (MDH) DETECTED LOW LEVELS OF

ANOTHER PERFLUORONATED COMPOUND CALLED PERFLUOROBUTANOIC ACID (PFBA) IN

MUNICIPAL WELLS (AND IN PRIVATE WELLS AS ANNOUNCED BY THE MDH IN JUNE 2007)

IN SIX NEARBY COMMUNITIES (WOODBURY, COTTAGE GROVE, NEWPORT, ST. PAUL PARK,

SOUTH ST. PAUL, AND HASTINGS, ALL COMMUNITIES LOCATED SOUTHEAST OF ST. PAUL),

SOME OF WHICH SLIGHTLY EXCEEDED THE MDHS INTERIM ADVISORY LEVEL FOR PFBA OF 1

PART PER BILLION (PPB). IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE MDH ESTABLISHED A

HEALTH-BASED VALUE (HBV) FOR PFBA OF 7 PPB BASED ON A CLEARER UNDERSTANDING OF

PFBA THROUGH THE RESULTS OF THREE MAJOR STUDIES AND SAMPLING MORE THAN 1,000

PRIVATE WELLS. AN HBV IS THE AMOUNT OF A CHEMICAL IN DRINKING WATER CONSIDERED

BY THE MDH STAFF TO BE SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO DRINK FOR A LIFETIME. AS A RESULT OF

THIS NEW HBV FOR PFBA, WELL ADVISORIES WILL NO LONGER BE REQUIRED FOR CERTAIN

WELLS IN THE MINNESOTA COMMUNITIES OF LAKE ELMO, OAKDALE AND COTTAGE GROVE.

RESIDENTS IN THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES WHERE THE LEVELS OF PFBA IN PRIVATE WELLS

EXCEED THE HBV EITHER HAVE BEEN PROVIDED WATER TREATMENT SYSTEMS OR CONNECTED

TO A CITY WATER SYSTEM. AS PART OF LEGISLATION PASSED DURING THE 2007 MINNESOTA

LEGISLATIVE SESSION DIRECTING THE MDH TO DEVELOP AND IMPLEMENT A STATEWIDE

ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH TRACKING AND BIOMONITORING PROGRAM, THE MDH ANNOUNCED IN JULY 2008

THAT IT WILL MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF PFCS IN THE BLOOD OF 200 ADULTS WHO LIVE IN

THE MINNESOTA COMMUNITIES OF OAKDALE, LAKE ELMO AND COTTAGE GROVE.

THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO WORK WITH THE MINNESOTA POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY (MPCA) PURSUANT

TO THE TERMS OF THE PREVIOUSLY DISCLOSED MAY 2007 SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND

CONSENT ORDER TO ADDRESS THE PRESENCE OF PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS IN THE SOIL

AND GROUNDWATER AT FORMER DISPOSAL SITES IN WASHINGTON COUNTY MINNESOTA AND AT

THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITY AT COTTAGE GROVE MINNESOTA. UNDER THIS

AGREEMENT, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE (I) EVALUATION OF

RELEASES OF PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS FROM THESE SITES AND PROPOSE RESPONSE

ACTIONS; (II) PROVIDING ALTERNATIVE DRINKING WATER IF AND WHEN AN HBV OR

HEALTH RISK LIMIT (HRL) (I.E., THE AMOUNT OF A CHEMICAL IN DRINKING WATER

DETERMINED BY THE MDH TO BE SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO DRINK FOR A LIFETIME) IS

EXCEEDED FOR ANY PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS AS A RESULT OF CONTAMINATION FROM

THESE SITES; (III) REMEDIATION OF ANY SOURCE OF PFBA AND PROVIDE

ALTERNATIVE DRINKING WATER IF AND WHEN LEVELS ARE FOUND ABOVE AN HBV OR HRL;

AND (IV) SHARING INFORMATION WITH THE MPCA ABOUT PERFLUORONATED COMPOUNDS.

DURING 2008, THE MPCA ISSUED FORMAL DECISIONS ADOPTING REMEDIAL OPTIONS FOR THE

FORMER DISPOSAL SITES IN WASHINGTON COUNTY MINNESOTA (OAKDALE AND WOODBURY).

THOSE OPTIONS WERE AMONG THE OPTIONS RECOMMENDED BY THE COMPANY. THE MPCA IS IN

THE PROCESS OF SELECTING A REMEDY FOR THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITY AT

COTTAGE GROVE.

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A VOLUNTARY REMEDIAL ACTION AGREEMENT WITH

THE ALABAMA DEPARTMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MANAGEMENT (ADEM) TO ADDRESS THE

PRESENCE OF PFCS IN THE SOIL ON THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN

DECATUR, ALABAMA. FOR APPROXIMATELY TWENTY YEARS, THE COMPANY INCORPORATED

WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT SLUDGE CONTAINING PFCS IN FIELDS SURROUNDING ITS

DECATUR FACILITY PURSUANT TO A PERMIT ISSUED BY ADEM. AFTER A REVIEW OF THE

AVAILABLE OPTIONS TO ADDRESS THE PRESENCE OF PFCS IN THE SOIL, ADEM AGREED THAT

THE PREFERRED REMEDIATION OPTION IS TO USE A MULTILAYER CAP OVER THE FORMER

SLUDGE INCORPORATION AREAS ON THE MANUFACTURING SITE WITH GROUNDWATER MIGRATION

CONTROLS AND TREATMENT.

LITIGATION

: AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, A FORMER

EMPLOYEE FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN 2002 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF

MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA, INVOLVING PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY, ALLEGING THAT THE

PLAINTIFFS SUFFERED FEAR, INCREASED RISK, SUBCLINICAL INJURIES, AND PROPERTY

DAMAGE FROM EXPOSURE TO PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY AT OR NEAR THE COMPANYS

DECATUR, ALABAMA, MANUFACTURING FACILITY. THE CIRCUIT COURT IN 2005 GRANTED THE

COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS PERSONAL INJURY-RELATED

CLAIMS ON THE BASIS THAT SUCH CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE EXCLUSIVITY PROVISIONS

OF THE STATES WORKERS COMPENSATION ACT. THE PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL FILED AN

AMENDED COMPLAINT IN NOVEMBER 2006, LIMITING THE CASE TO PROPERTY DAMAGE

CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF A PURPORTED CLASS OF RESIDENTS AND PROPERTY OWNERS IN THE

VICINITY OF THE DECATUR PLANT. ALSO IN 2005, THE JUDGE IN A SECOND PURPORTED

CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT (FILED BY THREE RESIDENTS OF MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA,

SEEKING UNSTATED COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES INVOLVING ALLEGED DAMAGE TO

THEIR PROPERTY FROM EMISSIONS OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS FROM THE COMPANYS

DECATUR, ALABAMA, MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT FORMERLY MANUFACTURED THOSE

COMPOUNDS) GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO ABATE THE CASE, EFFECTIVELY PUTTING

THE CASE ON HOLD PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF CLASS CERTIFICATION ISSUES IN THE

ACTION DESCRIBED ABOVE FILED IN THE SAME COURT IN 2002. DESPITE THE STAY,

PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT SEEKING DAMAGES FOR ALLEGED PERSONAL

INJURIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE ON BEHALF OF THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS AND THE MEMBERS

OF A PURPORTED CLASS. NO FURTHER ACTION IN THE CASE IS EXPECTED UNLESS AND

UNTIL THE STAY IS LIFTED.

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, TWO RESIDENTS OF WASHINGTON COUNTY, MINNESOTA, FILED IN OCTOBER 2004

A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF WASHINGTON COUNTY ON BEHALF

OF WASHINGTON COUNTY RESIDENTS WHO HAVE ALLEGEDLY SUFFERED PERSONAL INJURIES

AND PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM ALLEGED EMISSIONS FROM THE FORMER PERFLUOROOCTANYL

PRODUCTION FACILITY AT COTTAGE GROVE, MINNESOTA, AND FROM HISTORIC WASTE

DISPOSAL SITES IN THE VICINITY OF THAT FACILITY. AFTER THE DISTRICT COURT

GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO DISMISS THE CLAIMS FOR MEDICAL MONITORING AND

PUBLIC NUISANCE IN APRIL 2005, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT

ADDING ADDITIONAL ALLEGATIONS INVOLVING OTHER PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS

MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY, ALLEGING ADDITIONAL LEGAL THEORIES IN SUPPORT OF

THEIR CLAIMS, ADDING FOUR PLAINTIFFS, AND SEEKING RELIEF BASED ON ALLEGED

CONTAMINATION OF THE CITY OF OAKDALE MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY AND CERTAIN PRIVATE

WELLS IN THE VICINITY OF LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA. IN APRIL 2006, THE

PLAINTIFFS FILED A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT ADDING TWO ADDITIONAL PLAINTIFFS.

THE TWO ORIGINAL PLAINTIFFS THEREAFTER DISMISSED THEIR CLAIMS AGAINST THE

COMPANY. ON JUNE 19, 2007 THE COURT DENIED THE PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO

CERTIFY THE LITIGATION AS A CLASS ACTION. THEREAFTER, TWO OF THE REMAINING NAMED

PLAINTIFFS VOLUNTARILY DISMISSED THEIR CLAIMS. ON DECEMBER 17, 2008 THE

COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTIONS DISMISSING ALL OF THE

PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES UNDER THE MINNESOTA ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE AND

LIABILITY ACT AND ALL CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL INJURY, BUT ALLOWED THE PLAINTIFFS TO

ADD A CLAIM FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES WITH RESPECT TO THEIR PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS.

THE COURT HEARD ARGUMENT ON THE COMPANYS SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTIONS SEEKING

DISMISSAL OF THE PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS BASED ON NEGLIGENCE, NUISANCE AND TRESPASS,

AS WELL AS THEIR CLAIM FOR PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES RULINGS ON

THOSE SUMMARY JUDGMENT MOTIONS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009. TRIAL IS

SCHEDULED TO BEGIN ON MAY 4, 2009.

AS PREVIOUSLY

REPORTED, SEVERAL HUNDRED PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO HAVE LIVED IN THE VICINITY OF

THE ACME BARREL COMPANYS STORAGE DRUM RECONDITIONING FACILITY IN CHICAGO,

ILLINOIS, FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF

COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS, AGAINST 3M AND A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPANIES THAT

ALLEGEDLY WERE CUSTOMERS OF ACME BARREL. SINCE THE COURT REJECTED PLAINTIFFS

ATTEMPT TO HAVE THIS LITIGATION PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION, 66 INDIVIDUALS HAVE

ASSERTED CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND SEVERAL OTHER DEFENDANTS FOR DAMAGES

ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY EMISSIONS OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS FROM THE ACME BARREL DRUM

RECONDITIONING FACILITY. THE COMPANY SETTLED ALL OF THE INDIVIDUAL CLAIMS

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008, SUBJECT TO COURT APPROVAL.

ACCRUED

LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY

COMPLIES WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES, AND RELATED GUIDANCE, AND RECORDS LIABILITIES

FOR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THOSE INSTANCES WHERE IT CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE

AMOUNT OF THE LOSS AND WHERE LIABILITY IS PROBABLE. WHERE THE REASONABLE

ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABLE LOSS IS A RANGE, THE COMPANY RECORDS THE MOST LIKELY

ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS, OR THE LOW END OF THE RANGE IF THERE IS NO ONE BEST

ESTIMATE. THE COMPANY EITHER DISCLOSES THE AMOUNT OF A POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE

OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF ESTABLISHED RESERVES IF ESTIMABLE, OR STATES THAT SUCH AN

ESTIMATE CANNOT BE MADE. FOR THOSE INSURED MATTERS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN

A RESERVE, THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS RECEIVABLES FOR THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE

THAT IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER UNDER THE COMPANYS INSURANCE PROGRAM. FOR THOSE

INSURED MATTERS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS NOT TAKEN A RESERVE BECAUSE THE LIABILITY

IS NOT PROBABLE OR THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, BUT

WHERE THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED AN EXPENSE IN DEFENDING ITSELF, THE COMPANY

RECORDS RECEIVABLES FOR THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE THAT IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER FOR

THE EXPENSE INCURRED. THE COMPANY DISCLOSES SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS EVEN

WHERE LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT

ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, IF THE COMPANY BELIEVES THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE

POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BECAUSE LITIGATION

IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE RULINGS OR DEVELOPMENTS

COULD OCCUR, THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT THE COMPANY MAY NOT ULTIMATELY

INCUR CHARGES IN EXCESS OF PRESENTLY RECORDED LIABILITIES. A FUTURE ADVERSE

RULING, SETTLEMENT, OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES

THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECORDED. THE COMPANY

CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT SUCH FUTURE CHARGES, IF ANY, WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE COMPANY, TAKING

INTO ACCOUNT ITS SIGNIFICANT AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE. BASED ON EXPERIENCE

AND DEVELOPMENTS, THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REEXAMINES ITS ESTIMATES OF PROBABLE

LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED EXPENSES AND RECEIVABLES, AND WHETHER IT IS ABLE TO

ESTIMATE A LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED TO BE NOT ESTIMABLE AND/OR NOT

PROBABLE. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANY MAKES ADDITIONS TO OR ADJUSTMENTS OF

ITS ESTIMATED LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, THE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF THE POTENTIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY

COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY

ESTIMATES INSURANCE RECEIVABLES BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ITS NUMEROUS POLICIES,

INCLUDING THEIR EXCLUSIONS, PERTINENT CASE LAW INTERPRETING COMPARABLE

POLICIES, ITS EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR CLAIMS, AND ASSESSMENT OF THE NATURE OF

THE CLAIM, AND RECORDS AN AMOUNT IT HAS CONCLUDED IS LIKELY TO BE RECOVERED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS

THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF ON-GOING LITIGATION, ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND

OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE

ITS PROBABLE LIABILITY AND FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN RESERVES AND THE

RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

FOR THOSE SIGNIFICANT

PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE TABLE AND THAT ARE NOT THE

SUBJECT OF PENDING SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT

LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR

BOTH, AND THE COMPANY IS UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS AT

THIS TIME. THE AMOUNTS IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WITH RESPECT TO BREAST IMPLANT

AND ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION REPRESENT THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE

RESPECTIVE LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY SINGLE

BEST ESTIMATE OF THE RESPIRATOR/MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITY OR THE OTHER

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES SHOWN ABOVE, NOR THAT IT CAN RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE

AMOUNT OR RANGE OF AMOUNTS BY WHICH THOSE LIABILITIES MAY EXCEED THE RESERVES

THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED.

BREAST

IMPLANT LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

AS A RESULT OF ESTIMATED FUTURE PAYMENTS TO THE

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED GLOBAL SETTLEMENT FUND, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS RESERVES

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 FOR BREAST IMPLANT LIABILITIES BY $4 MILLION, TO

$5 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, THE COMPANYS RECEIVABLE FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO THE BREAST

IMPLANT MATTER WAS $6 MILLION. THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS RECEIVABLES IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO THE BREAST IMPLANT

MATTER BY $7 MILLION (BRINGING THE TOTAL INCREASE IN INSURANCE RECEIVABLES IN

2008 TO $12 MILLION) AND RECEIVED PAYMENTS UNDER THE COMPANYS INSURANCE

PROGRAM OF $15 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 (BRINGING THE TOTAL

RECOVERIES IN 2008 TO $70 MILLION). THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO PURSUE RECOVERY

AGAINST ITS REMAINING INSURERS AND EXPECTS TO COLLECT THE REMAINING RECEIVABLE.

RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES, INCLUDING THE COST TO RESOLVE THE CLAIM AND DEFENSE

COSTS, BY EXAMINING: (I) THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING CLAIMS, (II) APPARENT

TRENDS, (III) THE APPARENT QUALITY OF CLAIMS (

E.G.,

WHETHER THE CLAIM HAS BEEN ASSERTED ON BEHALF OF ASYMPTOMATIC CLAIMANTS), (IV) CHANGES

IN THE NATURE AND MIX OF CLAIMS (

E.G.,

THE

PROPORTION OF CLAIMS ASSERTING USAGE OF THE COMPANYS MASK OR RESPIRATOR

PRODUCTS AND ALLEGING EXPOSURE TO EACH OF ASBESTOS, SILICA, COAL OR OTHER

OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS, AND CLAIMS PLEADING USE OF ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCTS

ALLEGEDLY MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY), (V) THE NUMBER OF CURRENT CLAIMS

AND A PROJECTION OF THE NUMBER OF FUTURE ASBESTOS AND OTHER CLAIMS THAT MAY BE

FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY, (VI) THE COST TO RESOLVE RECENTLY SETTLED

CLAIMS, AND (VII) AN ESTIMATE OF THE COST TO RESOLVE AND DEFEND AGAINST

CURRENT AND FUTURE CLAIMS. BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN PROJECTING THE

NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT HAVE NOT YET BEEN ASSERTED, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO

THE COMPANYS RESPIRATORY PRODUCTS THAT THEMSELVES DID NOT CONTAIN ANY HARMFUL

MATERIALS (WHICH MAKES THE VARIOUS PUBLISHED STUDIES THAT PURPORT TO PROJECT

FUTURE ASBESTOS CLAIMS SUBSTANTIALLY REMOVED FROM THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL

EXPERIENCE AND WHICH THEMSELVES VARY WIDELY), THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT

THERE IS ANY SINGLE BEST ESTIMATE OF THIS LIABILITY, NOR THAT IT

90

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CAN RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE

AMOUNT OR RANGE OF AMOUNTS BY WHICH THE LIABILITY MAY EXCEED THE RESERVE THE

COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED. NO LIABILITY HAS BEEN RECORDED REGARDING THE PENDING

ACTION BROUGHT BY THE WEST VIRGINIA ATTORNEY GENERAL PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED.

DEVELOPMENTS MAY OCCUR

THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ITS LIABILITIES. THESE DEVELOPMENTS

INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN (I) THE NUMBER OF

FUTURE CLAIMS, (II) THE AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS, (III) THE

LEGAL COSTS OF DEFENDING THESE CLAIMS AND IN MAINTAINING TRIAL READINESS, (IV) CHANGES

IN THE MIX AND NATURE OF CLAIMS RECEIVED, (V) TRIAL AND APPELLATE

OUTCOMES, (VI) CHANGES IN THE LAW AND PROCEDURE APPLICABLE TO THESE

CLAIMS, AND (VII) THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER CO-DEFENDANTS AND

INSURERS.

AS A RESULT OF THE COSTS

OF AGGRESSIVELY DEFENDING ITSELF AND THE GREATER COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS OF

PERSONS WITH MALIGNANT CONDITIONS, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS RESERVES FOR

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES BY $25 MILLION IN 2008, ALL IN THE FOURTH

QUARTER. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY HAD RESERVES FOR RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES OF $105 MILLION (EXCLUDING AEARO RESERVES).

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, THE COMPANYS RECEIVABLE FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO THE RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION WAS $193 MILLION. THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS

RECEIVABLES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008 FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION BY $6 MILLION AND RECEIVED PAYMENTS UNDER

THE COMPANYS INSURANCE PROGRAM OF $13 MILLION IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2008

(BRINGING THE TOTAL RECOVERIES IN 2008 TO $145 MILLION). THE COMPANY CURRENTLY

HAS AGREEMENTS IN PLACE TO RECEIVE ANOTHER $18 MILLION OVER THE NEXT TWO

QUARTERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS RECEIVABLE.

VARIOUS FACTORS COULD

AFFECT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF RECOVERY OF THIS RECEIVABLE, INCLUDING (I) DELAYS

IN OR AVOIDANCE OF PAYMENT BY INSURERS; (II) THE EXTENT TO WHICH INSURERS

MAY BECOME INSOLVENT IN THE FUTURE, AND (III) THE OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS

WITH INSURERS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS

LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ACCRUED LIABILITY AND

INSURANCE RECEIVABLE REPRESENTS IN PART THE TIME DELAY BETWEEN PAYMENT OF

CLAIMS ON THE ONE HAND AND RECEIPT OF INSURANCE REIMBURSEMENTS ON THE OTHER

HAND. BECAUSE OF THE LAG TIME BETWEEN SETTLEMENT AND PAYMENT OF A CLAIM, NO

MEANINGFUL CONCLUSIONS MAY BE DRAWN FROM QUARTERLY OR ANNUAL CHANGES IN THE

AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES FOR EXPECTED INSURANCE RECOVERIES OR CHANGES IN THE

NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS.

ON JANUARY 5, 2007

THE COMPANY WAS SERVED WITH A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION FILED ON BEHALF OF

TWO OF ITS INSURERS (CONTINENTAL CASUALTY AND CONTINENTAL INSURANCE CO.  BOTH

PART OF THE CONTINENTAL CASUALTY GROUP) DISCLAIMING COVERAGE FOR RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS CLAIMS. THESE INSURERS REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY $14 MILLION OF THE

$193 MILLION INSURANCE RECOVERY RECEIVABLE REFERENCED IN THE ABOVE TABLE. THE

ACTION WAS FILED IN HENNEPIN COUNTY, MINNESOTA AND NAMES, IN ADDITION TO THE

COMPANY, OVER 60 OF THE COMPANYS INSURERS. THIS ACTION IS SIMILAR IN NATURE TO

AN ACTION FILED IN 1994 WITH RESPECT TO BREAST IMPLANT COVERAGE, WHICH

ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURTS RULING OF 2003 THAT WAS

LARGELY IN THE COMPANYS FAVOR. AT THE COMPANYS REQUEST, THE CASE WAS

TRANSFERRED TO RAMSEY COUNTY, OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF THE INSURERS. THE

MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT HEARD ORAL ARGUMENT OF THE INSURERS APPEAL OF THAT

DECISION IN MARCH 2008 AND RULED IN MAY 2008 THAT THE PROPER VENUE OF

THAT CASE IS RAMSEY COUNTY. THE COMPANY IS AWAITING THE ASSIGNMENT OF A JUDGE

TO THIS MATTER.

ENVIRONMENTAL

AND OTHER LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE COMPANY

HAD RECORDED LIABILITIES OF $31 MILLION FOR ESTIMATED ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

COSTS BASED UPON AN EVALUATION OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FACTS WITH RESPECT TO

EACH INDIVIDUAL SITE AND ALSO RECORDED RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES OF $15

MILLION. THE COMPANY RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION COSTS ON AN

UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY

NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT

TO A PLAN OF ACTION. LIABILITIES FOR ESTIMATED COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION,

DEPENDING ON THE SITE, ARE BASED PRIMARILY UPON INTERNAL OR THIRD-PARTY

ENVIRONMENTAL STUDIES, AND ESTIMATES AS TO THE NUMBER, PARTICIPATION LEVEL AND

FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF ANY OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, THE EXTENT OF

THE CONTAMINATION AND THE NATURE OF REQUIRED REMEDIAL ACTIONS. THE COMPANY

ADJUSTS RECORDED LIABILITIES AS FURTHER INFORMATION DEVELOPS OR CIRCUMSTANCES

CHANGE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT IT WILL PAY THE AMOUNTS RECORDED OVER THE

PERIODS OF REMEDIATION FOR THE APPLICABLE SITES, CURRENTLY RANGING UP TO 30

YEARS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008, THE COMPANY HAD RECORDED LIABILITIES OF $137 MILLION FOR ESTIMATED OTHER

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES BASED UPON AN EVALUATION OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FACTS

FOR ADDRESSING TRACE AMOUNTS OF PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS IN DRINKING WATER

SOURCES IN THE CITY OF OAKDALE AND LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA, AS WELL AS PRESENCE IN

THE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER AT THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN DECATUR,

ALABAMA, AND COTTAGE GROVE, MINNESOTA, AND AT TWO FORMER DISPOSAL SITES IN

MINNESOTA. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT MOST OF THE SPENDING WILL OCCUR OVER THE

NEXT THREE TO SEVEN YEARS.

IT IS DIFFICULT TO

ESTIMATE THE COST OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND REMEDIATION GIVEN THE

UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF APPLICABLE

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE EXTENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION

AND THE EXISTENCE OF ALTERNATE CLEANUP METHODS. DEVELOPMENTS MAY OCCUR THAT

COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS

CURRENT

ASSESSMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO: (I) CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION

AVAILABLE REGARDING THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND

PRODUCTS; (II) CHANGES IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, CHANGES IN

PERMISSIBLE LEVELS OF SPECIFIC COMPOUNDS IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES, OR CHANGES

IN ENFORCEMENT THEORIES AND POLICIES, INCLUDING EFFORTS TO RECOVER NATURAL

RESOURCE DAMAGES; (III) NEW AND EVOLVING ANALYTICAL AND REMEDIATION

TECHNIQUES; (IV) SUCCESS IN ALLOCATING LIABILITY TO OTHER POTENTIALLY

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES; AND (V) THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER POTENTIALLY

RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND THIRD-PARTY INDEMNITORS.

NOTE 15.

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

THE COMPANY

SPONSORS EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS UNDER SECTION 401(K) OF THE INTERNAL

REVENUE CODE. THESE PLANS ARE OFFERED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL REGULAR U.S.

EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS OF UP TO 6% OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION ARE

MATCHED AT RATES OF 35% OR 50%, DEPENDING ON THE PLAN THE EMPLOYEE IS

PARTICIPATING IN, WITH ADDITIONAL COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS DEPENDING UPON COMPANY

PERFORMANCE. ALL COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS INITIALLY ARE INVESTED IN 3M COMMON

STOCK, WITH EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS INVESTED IN A NUMBER OF INVESTMENT FUNDS

PURSUANT TO THEIR ELECTIONS. VESTED EMPLOYEES MAY DIVERSIFY THEIR 3M SHARES

INTO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS.

DURING 2008 THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED VARIOUS CHANGES TO THE EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, EMPLOYER CONTRIBUTIONS WILL NO LONGER BE BASED

ON COMPANY PERFORMANCE; HOWEVER, THE MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR ELIGIBLE

PARTICIPANTS HIRED BEFORE JANUARY 1, 2009, WILL INCREASE FROM 35% TO 60%,

OR FROM 50% TO 75%, FOR EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO THE FIRST 6% OF ELIGIBLE

COMPENSATION, DEPENDING ON THE PLAN THE EMPLOYEE IS PARTICIPATING IN. ELIGIBLE

PARTICIPANTS HIRED OR REHIRED ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 2009, WILL RECEIVE A

CASH MATCH OF 100% FOR EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS UP TO THE FIRST 6% OF ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION

AND ALSO RECEIVE AN EMPLOYER RETIREMENT INCOME ACCOUNT CASH CONTRIBUTION OF 3%

OF THE PARTICIPANTS TOTAL ELIGIBLE COMPENSATION. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2010, THE MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PARTICIPANTS HIRED OR REHIRED PRIOR TO JANUARY 1,

2009, WILL BE MADE IN CASH.

THE COMPANY

MAINTAINS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). THIS PLAN WAS ESTABLISHED IN

1989 AS A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OF FUNDING THE MAJORITY OF THE COMPANYS

CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER 401(K) EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS. TOTAL ESOP SHARES ARE

CONSIDERED TO BE SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS PER SHARE CALCULATIONS. THE

ESOP DEBT OBLIGATION WILL MATURE IN 2009 (NOTE 10).

DIVIDENDS ON SHARES HELD BY THE ESOP ARE PAID TO THE ESOP

TRUST AND, TOGETHER WITH COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS, ARE USED BY THE ESOP TO REPAY

PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON THE OUTSTANDING ESOP DEBT. THE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO

DIVIDENDS PAID ON UNALLOCATED SHARES WAS CHARGED DIRECTLY TO EQUITY AND TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION IN 2008, $3 MILLION IN 2007, AND $3 MILLION IN

2006. OVER THE LIFE OF THE ESOP DEBT, SHARES ARE RELEASED FOR ALLOCATION TO

PARTICIPANTS BASED ON THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT YEARS DEBT SERVICE TO THE

REMAINING DEBT SERVICE PRIOR TO THE CURRENT PAYMENT.

THE ESOP HAS BEEN THE

PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS. AS PERMITTED

BY AICPA STATEMENT OF POSITION 93-6, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK

OWNERSHIP PLANS, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO CONTINUE ITS PRACTICES, WHICH ARE

BASED ON STATEMENT OF POSITION 76-3, ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE

STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS AND SUBSEQUENT CONSENSUS OF THE EITF OF THE FASB.

ACCORDINGLY, THE DEBT OF THE ESOP IS RECORDED AS DEBT, AND SHARES PLEDGED AS

COLLATERAL ARE REPORTED AS UNEARNED COMPENSATION IN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE

SHEET AND CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. UNEARNED COMPENSATION IS REDUCED SYMMETRICALLY AS THE

ESOP MAKES PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON THE DEBT. EXPENSES RELATED TO THE ESOP INCLUDE

TOTAL DEBT SERVICE ON THE NOTES, LESS DIVIDENDS. THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES

TREASURY SHARES, ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, TO EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS TO

COVER OBLIGATIONS NOT FUNDED BY THE ESOP (REPORTED AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT

EXPENSE).

IN MAY 2008, SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED 35 MILLION

SHARES FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 3M 2008 LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN, WHICH

REPLACED AND SUCCEEDED THE 2005 MANAGEMENT STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM (MSOP), THE

3M PERFORMANCE UNIT PLAN, AND THE 1992 DIRECTORS STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM.

SHARES UNDER THIS PLAN MAY BE ISSUED IN THE FORM OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS,

NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, PROGRESSIVE STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION

RIGHTS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, OTHER STOCK AWARDS, AND

PERFORMANCE UNITS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES. AWARDS DENOMINATED IN SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK OTHER THAN OPTIONS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS, PER THE 2008

PLAN, WILL BE COUNTED AGAINST THE 35 MILLION SHARE LIMIT AS 3.38 SHARES FOR

EVERY ONE SHARE COVERED BY SUCH AWARD. THE REMAINING TOTAL SHARES AVAILABLE FOR

GRANT UNDER THE 2008 LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN PROGRAM ARE 26,842,759 AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2008. IN 2008 AND PRIOR, THE COMPANY ISSUED OPTIONS TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES

ANNUALLY IN MAY USING THE CLOSING STOCK PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE, WHICH WAS

THE DATE OF THE ANNUAL STOCKHOLDERS MEETING. IN ADDITION TO THESE ANNUAL

GRANTS, THE COMPANY MAKES OTHER MINOR GRANTS OF STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED GRANTS. THE COMPANY ISSUES CASH SETTLED RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES. THESE GRANTS DO

NOT RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK AND ARE CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL BY THE

COMPANY. THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 14,372 PARTICIPANTS WITH OUTSTANDING OPTIONS,

RESTRICTED STOCK, OR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2008.

EFFECTIVE WITH THE MAY 2005

MANAGEMENT STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM ANNUAL GRANT, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS

VESTING PERIOD FROM ONE TO THREE YEARS WITH THE EXPIRATION DATE REMAINING AT 10

YEARS FROM DATE OF GRANT. BEGINNING IN 2007, THE COMPANY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF

TRADITIONAL STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED UNDER THE MSOP PLAN BY REDUCING THE NUMBER OF

EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ANNUAL GRANTS AND BY SHIFTING A PORTION OF THE

ANNUAL GRANT AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL STOCK OPTIONS PRIMARILY TO RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS. HOWEVER, ASSOCIATED WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE

EMPLOYEES, THE COMPANY PROVIDED A ONE-TIME BUYOUT GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK

UNITS TO THE IMPACTED EMPLOYEES, WHICH RESULTED IN INCREASED STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN 2007. THE INCOME TAX BENEFITS SHOWN IN THE FOLLOWING

TABLE CAN FLUCTUATE BY PERIOD DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS

(ISO) EXERCISED SINCE THE COMPANY RECEIVES THE ISO TAX BENEFIT UPON EXERCISE.

THE COMPANY LAST GRANTED ISO IN 2002. AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS WITH RESPECT TO STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROGRAMS, WHICH INCLUDE

STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND THE GENERAL

EMPLOYEES STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (GESPP), ARE AS FOLLOWS.

OUTSTANDING SHARES

UNDER OPTION INCLUDE GRANTS FROM PREVIOUS PLANS. FOR OPTIONS OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL LIFE WAS 60 MONTHS AND THE

AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE WAS $98 MILLION. FOR OPTIONS EXERCISABLE AT DECEMBER 31,

2008, THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL LIFE WAS 53 MONTHS AND THE

AGGREGATE INTRINSIC VALUE WAS $98 MILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THERE

TO NON-VESTED STOCK OPTION-BASED AWARDS. THIS EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED

OVER THE REMAINING VESTING PERIOD WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIFE OF 1.7 YEARS.

THE TOTAL

INTRINSIC VALUES OF STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2008, 2007 AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY, WAS $107 MILLION, $373 MILLION AND $289 MILLION. CASH RECEIVED

FROM OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2008, 2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY, WAS $188

MILLION, $692 MILLION AND $414 MILLION. THE COMPANYS ACTUAL TAX BENEFITS

THE COMPANY DOES

NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC POLICY TO REPURCHASE COMMON SHARES TO MITIGATE THE DILUTIVE

IMPACT OF OPTIONS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY MADE ADEQUATE

DISCRETIONARY PURCHASES, BASED ON CASH AVAILABILITY, MARKET TRENDS AND OTHER

FACTORS, TO SATISFY STOCK OPTION EXERCISE ACTIVITY.

FOR ANNUAL AND

PROGRESSIVE (RELOAD) OPTIONS, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE FAIR VALUE AT THE DATE OF

EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS A STATISTICAL MEASURE OF THE

AMOUNT BY WHICH A STOCK PRICE IS EXPECTED TO FLUCTUATE DURING A PERIOD. FOR THE

2008, 2007 AND 2006 ANNUAL GRANT DATE, THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THE EXPECTED

VOLATILITY BASED UPON THE AVERAGE OF THE MOST RECENT ONE YEAR VOLATILITY, THE

MEDIAN OF THE TERM OF THE EXPECTED LIFE ROLLING VOLATILITY, THE MEDIAN OF THE

MOST RECENT TERM OF THE EXPECTED LIFE VOLATILITY OF 3M STOCK, AND THE IMPLIED

VOLATILITY ON THE GRANT DATE. THE EXPECTED TERM ASSUMPTION IS BASED ON THE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF HISTORICAL GRANTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, BEGINNING IN 2007, THE

COMPANY EXPANDED ITS UTILIZATION OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. RESTRICTED STOCK

UNIT GRANTS DO NOT ACCRUE DIVIDENDS DURING THE VESTING PERIOD AND GENERALLY

VEST AT THE END OF THREE YEARS. THE

NOTE 17.  BUSINESS

SEGMENTS

EFFECTIVE IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2008, 3M MADE CERTAIN CHANGES TO ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS IN ITS

CONTINUING EFFORT TO DRIVE GROWTH BY ALIGNING BUSINESSES AROUND MARKETS AND

CUSTOMERS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE CHANGES ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

·

3MS DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT CREATED

THE PROJECTION SYSTEMS DEPARTMENT BY COMBINING VISUAL SYSTEMS, 3M PRECISION

OPTICS INC. AND THE COMPANYS MOBILE DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY. THE NEW DEPARTMENT

FOCUSES ON BRINGING 3M TECHNOLOGY TO THE PROJECTION MARKET, PROVIDING CUSTOMERS

WITH A CENTRALIZED RESOURCE DEDICATED TO DEVELOPING DIFFERENTIATED SOLUTIONS.

VISUAL SYSTEMS (PREVIOUSLY IN THE ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT) SERVES

THE WORLDS OFFICE AND EDUCATION MARKETS WITH OVERHEAD PROJECTORS AND

TRANSPARENCY FILMS, AS WELL AS EQUIPMENT AND MATERIALS FOR ELECTRONIC AND

MULTIMEDIA PRESENTATIONS. 3M PRECISION OPTICS INC. AND THE COMPANYS MOBILE

DISPLAY TECHNOLOGY WERE PREVIOUSLY PART OF THE OPTICAL SYSTEMS DIVISION WITHIN

THE DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT.

·

3MS TOUCH SYSTEMS BUSINESS (PREVIOUSLY

IN THE DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT), WHICH INCLUDES TOUCH SCREENS AND TOUCH

MONITORS, WAS TRANSFERRED TO THE ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT. TOUCH

SYSTEMS BRINGS SYNERGISTIC TECHNOLOGIES AND STRONG ALIGNMENT WITH 3MS

ELECTRONICS DIVISIONS AND MARKETS.

·

CERTAIN ADHESIVES AND TAPES IN THE

INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES AND TAPES BUSINESS (INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT)

WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENT, PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE

STATIONERY PRODUCTS BUSINESS AND CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT BUSINESS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE NET SALES AND

OPERATING INCOME AMOUNTS PRESENTED HEREIN REFLECT THE IMPACT OF ALL OF THE

PRECEDING CHANGES FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED. CHANGES IN ASSETS, DEPRECIATION

AND AMORTIZATION, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURE AMOUNTS WERE NOT MATERIAL AND HAVE

NOT BEEN REVISED.

3MS BUSINESSES ARE

ORGANIZED, MANAGED AND INTERNALLY GROUPED INTO SEGMENTS BASED ON DIFFERENCES IN

PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES. 3M CONTINUES TO MANAGE ITS OPERATIONS IN

SIX OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS: INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT; HEALTH

CARE SEGMENT; SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES SEGMENT; CONSUMER AND

OFFICE SEGMENT; DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT; AND ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS

SEGMENT. 3MS SIX BUSINESS SEGMENTS BRING TOGETHER COMMON OR RELATED 3M

TECHNOLOGIES, ENHANCING THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND

PROVIDING FOR EFFICIENT SHARING OF BUSINESS RESOURCES. THESE SEGMENTS HAVE

WORLDWIDE RESPONSIBILITY FOR VIRTUALLY ALL 3M PRODUCT LINES. 3M IS NOT

DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE PRODUCT OR MARKET. CERTAIN SMALL BUSINESSES AND

LAB-SPONSORED PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS CORPORATE ASSETS AND EXPENSES, ARE

NOT ATTRIBUTED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

TRANSACTIONS AMONG

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE RECORDED AT COST. 3M IS AN INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE

CHARACTERIZED BY SUBSTANTIAL INTERSEGMENT COOPERATION, COST ALLOCATIONS AND

INVENTORY TRANSFERS. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT REPRESENT THAT THESE

SEGMENTS, IF OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY, WOULD REPORT THE OPERATING INCOME AND

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION SHOWN. THE ALLOCATIONS RESULTING FROM THE SHARED

UTILIZATION OF ASSETS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE UNDERLYING ACTIVITY

FOR SEGMENT ASSETS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.

SEGMENT ASSETS FOR

THE OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS (EXCLUDING CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED) PRIMARILY

INCLUDE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE; INVENTORY; PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT  NET; GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS;

AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS ASSETS. ASSETS INCLUDED IN CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED

PRINCIPALLY ARE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES; INSURANCE

RECEIVABLES; DEFERRED INCOME TAXES; CERTAIN INVESTMENTS AND OTHER ASSETS,

INCLUDING PREPAID PENSION ASSETS. CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED ASSETS CAN CHANGE

FROM YEAR TO YEAR DUE TO CHANGES IN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE

SECURITIES, CHANGES IN PREPAID PENSION BENEFITS, AND CHANGES IN OTHER

UNALLOCATED ASSET CATEGORIES. FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING PURPOSES, CORPORATE

GOODWILL (WHICH AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, TOTALED $487 MILLION) IS NOT

ALLOCATED TO THE SIX OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS. IN NOTE 3, CORPORATE GOODWILL

HAS BEEN ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE MARKET SEGMENTS AS REQUIRED BY SFAS NO. 142

FOR IMPAIRMENT TESTING.

CORPORATE AND

UNALLOCATED OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES A VARIETY OF MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS, SUCH AS

CORPORATE INVESTMENT GAINS AND LOSSES, CERTAIN DERIVATIVE GAINS AND LOSSES,

INSURANCE-RELATED GAINS AND LOSSES, CERTAIN LITIGATION AND ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENSES, CORPORATE RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND CERTAIN UNDER- OR OVER-ABSORBED

COSTS (E.G. PENSION) THAT THE COMPANY MAY CHOOSE NOT TO ALLOCATE DIRECTLY TO

ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. BECAUSE THIS CATEGORY INCLUDES A VARIETY OF

MISCELLANEOUS ITEMS, IT IS SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATION ON A QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL

BASIS.

THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IMPACTING 2008 RESULTS WERE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT

ACTIVITIES. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IMPACTING BOTH 2007 AND 2006 RESULTS ARE

THE NET GAIN ON SALE OF THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS (WITHIN THE HEALTH CARE

SEGMENT) AND RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ACTIONS. REFER TO NOTE 2 FOR DISCUSSION OF

DIVESTITURES AND NOTE 4 FOR DISCUSSION OF RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND EXIT

ACTIVITIES.
