distribution
3m products are sold through numerous distribution channels, including
directly to users and through numerous wholesalers, retailers, jobbers,
distributors and dealers in a wide variety of trades in many countries around
the world. management believes the confidence of wholesalers, retailers,
jobbers, distributors and dealers in 3m and its products  a
confidence developed through long association with skilled marketing and sales
representatives  has contributed
significantly to 3ms position in the marketplace and to its growth. 3m has 157
sales offices worldwide, with nine in the united states and 148
internationally.
research and patents
research and product development constitutes an important part of 3ms
activities and has been a major driver of 3ms sales growth. research,
development and related expenses totaled $1.368 billion in 2007, $1.522 billion
in 2006 and $1.274 billion in 2005. the global branded pharmaceuticals
business, which was divested in december2006 and january2007,
incurred research, development and related expenses of approximately $120
million in 2006 and $142 million in 2005. the 2006 amount also included a $95million in-process research and development charge (discussed in note 2) and $75
million in restructuring actions (note 4). research and development, covering
basic scientific research and the application of scientific advances in the
development of new and improved products and their uses, totaled $788 million
in 2007, compared to $943 million in 2006, decreasing due to the $95 million
for purchased in-process research and development discussed above and also due
to the pharmaceuticals business divestiture. research and development expenses
totaled $818 million in 2005. related expenses primarily include technical
support provided by 3m to existing customers who are using 3m products, and the
costs of internally developed patents.
the companys products are sold around the world under various
trademarks that are important to the company. the company also owns, or holds
licenses to use, numerous u.s. and foreign patents. the companys research and
development activities generate a steady stream of inventions that are covered
by new patents. patents applicable to specific products extend for varying
periods according to the date of patent application filing or patent grant and
the legal term of patents in the various countries where patent protection is
obtained. the actual protection afforded by a patent, which can vary from
country to country, depends upon the type of patent, the scope of its coverage
and the availability of legal remedies in the country.
the company believes that its patents provide an important competitive
advantage in many of its businesses. in general, no single patent or group of
related patents is in itself essential to the company as a whole or to any of
the companys
business segments. the importance of patents in the display and graphics
segments is described in performance by business segment  display and
graphics business in partii, item 7.
raw materials
in 2007, the company experienced cost increases
affecting metals, wood pulp and oil-derived raw materials. costs for these
materials have remained high throughout the year, and 3m would expect this
level to carry over into early 2008, with some moderation occurring later in
the year. to date, the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw
materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. it is
impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such
shortages would have. 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations
through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development
and qualification of additional supply sources. 3m manages commodity price
risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and
forward physical contracts.
environmental law compliance
3ms manufacturing operations are affected by
national, state and local environmental laws around the world. 3m has made, and
plans to continue making, necessary expenditures for compliance with applicable
laws. 3m is also involved in remediation actions relating to environmental
matters from past operations at certain sites (refer to environmental and
other liabilities and insurance receivables in note 13, commitments and
contingencies).
environmental expenditures relating to existing
conditions caused by past operations that do not contribute to current or
future revenues are expensed. reserves for liabilities for anticipated
remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted basis when they are probable
and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the completion of feasibility
studies or the companys commitment to a plan of action. environmental
expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future
operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives.
in 2007, 3m expended about $21 million for capital
projects related to protecting the environment. this amount excludes
expenditures for remediation actions relating to existing matters caused by
past operations. capital expenditures for environmental purposes have included
pollution control devices  such as wastewater treatment plant improvements,
scrubbers, containment structures, solvent recovery units and thermal oxidizers
at new and existing facilities constructed or upgraded in the normal course
of business. consistent with the companys policies stressing environmental
responsibility, capital expenditures (other than for remediation projects) for
known projects are presently expected to be about $47million over the
next two years for new or expanded programs to build facilities or modify
manufacturing processes to minimize waste and reduce emissions.
while the company cannot predict with certainty the
future costs of such cleanup activities, capital expenditures or operating
costs for environmental compliance, the company does not believe they will have
a material effect on its capital expenditures, earnings or competitive
position.

item 1a. risk factors.
the most
significant risk factors applicable to the company are as follows:
* results are impacted by the effects of, and changes in, worldwide
economic conditions. the company operates in more than 60 countries and
derives approximately 63% of its revenues from outside the united states. the
companys business may be affected by factors in the united states and other
countries that are beyond its control, such as downturns in economic activity
in a specific country or region, or in the various industries in which the
company operates; social, political or labor conditions in a specific country
or region; or adverse changes in interest rates, tax, or regulations in the
jurisdictions in which the company operates.
* the
companys results are affected by competitive conditions and customer
preferences. demand for the companys products, which impacts
revenue and profit margins, is affected by (i)the development and timing
of the introduction of competitive products; (ii)the companys response
to downward pricing to stay competitive; (iii)changes in customer order
patterns, such as changes in the levels of inventory maintained by customers
and the timing of customer purchases which may be affected by announced price
changes, changes in the companys incentive programs, or the customers ability
to achieve incentive goals; and (iv)changes in customers preferences for
our products, including the success of products offered by our competitors, and
changes in customer designs for their products that can affect the demand for
some of the companys products.
* foreign currency exchange rates and fluctuations in those rates may
affect the companys ability to realize projected growth rates in its sales and
earnings. because the company derives approximately 63% of
its revenues from outside the united states, its ability to realize projected
growth rates in sales and earnings could be adversely affected if the u.s.
dollar strengthens significantly against foreign currencies.
* the companys growth objectives are largely dependent on the timing
and market acceptance of its new product offerings, including its ability to continually renew its pipeline of new
products and to bring those products to market. this ability may be
adversely affected by difficulties or delays in product development, such as
the inability to identify viable new products, obtain adequate intellectual
property protection, or gain market acceptance of new products. there are no
guarantees that new products will prove to be commercially successful.
* the companys future results are subject to fluctuations in the costs
and availability of purchased components, compounds, raw materials
and energy, including oil
and natural gas and their derivatives, due to
shortages, increased demand, supply interruptions, currency exchange risks,
natural disasters and other factors. the company depends on various
components, compounds, raw materials, and energy (including oil and natural gas
and their derivatives) supplied by others for the manufacturing of its
products. it is possible that any of its supplier relationships could be
interrupted due to natural and other disasters and other events, or be
terminated in the future. any sustained interruption in the companys receipt
of adequate supplies could have a material adverse effect on the company. in
addition, while the company has a process to minimize volatility in component
and material pricing, no assurance can be given that the company will be able
to successfully manage price fluctuations or that future price fluctuations or
shortages will not have a material adverse effect on the company.
* acquisitions, strategic alliances,
divestitures, and other unusual events resulting from portfolio management
actions and other evolving business strategies, and possible organizational
restructuring could affect future results. the company monitors its
business portfolio and organizational structure and has made and may continue
to make acquisitions, strategic alliances, divestitures and changes to its
organizational structure. with respect to acquisitions, future results will be
affected by the companys ability to integrate acquired businesses quickly and
obtain the anticipated synergies.
* the companys future results may
be affected if the company generates fewer productivity improvements than
estimated. the company utilizes various tools, such as lean six
sigma, to improve operational efficiency and productivity. there can be no
assurance that all of the projected productivity improvements will be realized.
* the companys future results may
be affected by various legal and regulatory proceedings, including those
involving product liability, antitrust, environmental or other matters.
the outcome of these legal proceedings may differ from the companys
expectations because the outcomes of litigation, including regulatory matters,
are often difficult to reliably predict. various factors or developments can
lead the company to change current estimates of liabilities and related
insurance receivables where applicable, or make such estimates for matters
previously not susceptible of reasonable estimates, such as a significant
judicial ruling or judgment, a significant settlement, significant regulatory
developments or changes in applicable law. a future adverse ruling, settlement
or unfavorable development could result in future charges that could have a
material adverse effect on the companys results of operations or cash flows in
any particular period. for a more detailed discussion of the legal proceedings
involving the company and the associated accounting estimates, see the
discussion in note 13.

the above income and earnings per share information exclude a cumulative

1 for more detail.
2007 results included net gains that increased operating income by $681
million and net income by $448 million. 2007 included gains related to the sale of businesses
($849 million pre-tax, $550 million after-tax)
and a gain on sale of real estate ($52 million pre-tax, $37 million after-tax),
which were partially offset by increases in environmental liabilities ($134
million pre-tax, $83 million after-tax), restructuring actions ($41 million
pre-tax, $27 million after-tax), and other exit activities ($45 million
pre-tax, $29 million after-tax). 2006 results included net
gains that increased operating income by $523 million and net income by $438
million. 2006 included net benefits from gains related to the sale of certain portions of 3ms
branded pharmaceuticals business ($1.074 billion pre-tax, $674 million
after-tax) and favorable income tax
adjustments ($149 million), which were partially offset by restructuring
actions ($403 million pre-tax, $257 million after-tax), acquired in-process
research and development expenses ($95 million pre-tax and after-tax),
settlement costs of a previously disclosed antitrust class action ($40 million
pre-tax, $25 million after-tax), and environmental obligations related to the
pharmaceuticals business ($13million pre-tax, $8 million after-tax). 2005
results included charges that reduced net income by $75 million. this related
to a tax liability resulting from 3ms reinvestment of approximately $1.7
billion of foreign earnings in the united states pursuant to the repatriation
provisions of the american jobs creation act of 2004. 2003 results included
charges related to an adverse ruling in a lawsuit filed against 3m in
1997 by lepages inc. that reduced operating
income by $93million ($58 million after tax).

overview
3m
is a diversified global manufacturer, technology innovator and marketer of a
wide variety of products. 3m manages its operations in six operating business
segments: industrial and transportation; health care; display and graphics;
consumer and office; safety, security and protection services; and electro and communications.
3ms strategy
continues to emphasize a commitment to grow at a faster pace, using a
four-pronged approach, which includes reinvesting in its core businesses,
developing adjacent emerging business opportunities, expanding on the companys
already world-class capabilities internationally, and acquiring companies in
complementary faster-growing industries. the company will continue to invest in
research and development and plant start-ups in 2008, including investments in emerging
markets around the world. research, development and related expenses totaled
$1.368 billion in 2007. capital expenditures totaled $1.422 billion in 2007, up
$254 million compared with 2006. the company expects capital expenditures to
total approximately $1.3billion to $1.4 billion in 2008, providing the
capacity to meet expected growth.
in december2006 and january2007, 3m completed the sale of
its branded pharmaceuticals business, resulting in gains in the fourth quarter
of 2006 and first quarter of 2007. in addition, 3m recorded a gain related to
the sale of its
opticom priority control systems and canoga traffic detection businesses in the second quarter of 2007. in both 2007 and
2006, these gains on sale of businesses and a gain on sale of real estate were
partially offset by restructuring and other items. refer to note a at the end
of this overview section for additional details. including these items, in
2007, 3m reported record net sales of $24.462 billion and record net income of
$4.096 billion, or $5.60 per diluted share, compared with net sales of $22.923 billion and net income of
$3.851 billion, or $5.06 per diluted share, in 2006. excluding the items in
note a in both years, the company still achieved strong underlying operating
performance, helped by a 6.7% increase in net sales, which included the
divestiture impacts discussed above that reduced sales growth by 3.8%.
the following table contains sales and operating income results by
business segment for the years ended december31, 2007 and 2006. refer to
the performance by business segment section for discussion of the gain on sale
of businesses, restructuring and other items that impacted reported operating

in
2007, worldwide total sales increased 6.7%. local-currency sales growth (which
includes volume, selling price and acquisition impacts, but excludes
divestiture and translation impacts) was 7.3%, with organic local-currency
growth of 4.9% (including 0.7% benefit from pharmaceuticals supply agreements)
and acquisitions adding 2.4%. divestitures, primarily the sale of the global
branded pharmaceuticals business (health care segment), decreased worldwide
sales growth by 3.8%. the sale of the pharmaceuticals business is not presented
as a discontinued operation due to the extent of the projected continuing cash
flows from 3ms contractual supply relationship with the buyers in relation to
those of the business that was sold.
the
breadth of 3ms product lines was evident during 2007 as the company
experienced solid sales growth across the portfolio. health care led all
segments with local-currency sales growth of 18.3% (excluding divestitures).
this includes a 4.4% benefit from acquisitions and 4.5% benefit due to the
pharmaceuticals supply agreements. the sale of 3ms global
branded pharmaceuticals business reduced health care sales growth by 23.7%. local-currency sales increased
10.8% in safety, security and protection services, including 7.4% from numerous
acquisitions. local-currency sales increased 5.8% in
industrial and transportation, 5.0% in consumer and office, 2.3% in electro and
communications, and 1.8% (excluding the impact of the opticom/canoga
divestiture) in display and graphics. while 3m experienced broad-based sales
growth, there was softness in certain markets in 2007. within display and
graphics, optical film sales increased slightly year-on-year, but 3m experienced
an attachment rate loss in lcd desktop monitors and lcd tv segments,
particularly in the second half of 2007, as competition continued to intensify
in this market. 3m also experienced weakness in its roofing granules business
for residential asphalt shingles and in its electronic solutions business due
to softness in certain segments of the consumer electronics market. refer to the section entitled performance
by business segment for a more detailed discussion of the results of the
respective segments.
geographically, the
european region (which includes europe, middle east and africa) led
local-currency sales growth in 2007, with an increase of 11.7%, 7.4% of which
was organic (excluding acquisitions, divestiture and translation impacts).
sales growth in europe was led by safety, security and protection services and
health care (without pharmaceuticals). the combined latin america and canada
area local-currency sales increased 10.6%, of which 9.6% was organic, with
growth led by industrial and transportation, safety, security and protection
services and health care (without pharmaceuticals). asia pacific local-currency
sales increased 4.9%, of which 4.5% was organic, with all six business segments
contributing to this increase. united states local-currency sales increased
5.7%, of which 2.6% was organic. organic volume growth in the u.s. was led by
health care (without pharmaceuticals) and industrial and transportation, which
was partially offset by softness in the electronic solutions business and weakness
in a few businesses that are impacted by the slowdown in the u.s. housing, road
construction and mass retail markets, primarily the roofing granules,
protective materials, traffic safety and office supply businesses. divestitures,
primarily the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business, reduced
sales in europe by 6.6%, in the united states by 4.2%, in the combined latin
america and canada area by 2.8%, and in asia pacific by 1.3%. currency effects increased total
international sales by 5.2%, with europe positively impacted by 8.5%, the
combined latin america and canada area by 5.9%, and asia pacific by 2.0%, as
the u.s. dollar weakened in aggregate against the multitude of currencies in
these geographic areas.
operating income for 2007 increased 8.7% year-on-year, including a
net 2.2 percentage point benefit from the impact of items discussed in note a
below. operating income margins were approximately 25%
in both 2007 and 2006, with items in note a positively impacting these margins
in both years by approximately 2.5 percentage points.
3m generated $4.275
billion of operating cash flows in 2007, an
increase of $436 million compared to 2006. in 2007, the company utilized $4.619
billion of cash to repurchase 3m common stock and pay dividends, compared to
$3.727 billion in 2006. in february2007, 3ms board of directors
authorized a two-year share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion for the period
from february12, 2007 to february28, 2009. as of december31,
2007, approximately $4.1 billion remained available for repurchase. in february2008,
3ms board authorized a dividend increase of 4.2% for 2008, marking the 50thconsecutive
year of dividend increases for 3m. 3ms debt to total capital ratio (total
capital defined as debt plus equity) as of december31, 2007 was 30%. 3m
has an aa credit rating from standard& poors, with a stable outlook,
and an aa1 credit rating from moodys investors service, with a negative
outlook. the company has sufficient access to capital markets to meet currently
anticipated growth and acquisition investment funding needs.
in 2007, the company experienced cost increases
affecting metals, wood pulp and oil-derived raw materials. costs for these
materials have remained high throughout the year, and 3m would expect this
level to carry over into early 2008, with some moderation occurring later in
the year. to date the company is receiving sufficient quantities of all raw
materials to meet its reasonably foreseeable production requirements. it is
impossible to predict future shortages of raw materials or the impact any such
shortages would have. 3m has avoided disruption to its manufacturing operations
through careful management of existing raw material inventories and development
and qualification of additional supply sources. 3m manages commodity price
risks through negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and
forward physical contracts.
in 2007, the
company modified elements of its long-term incentive compensation programs.
with the may2007 management
stock ownership program (msop) annual grant,
the company reduced the number of traditional stock options granted by reducing
the number of employees eligible to receive annual grants and by shifting a
portion of the annual grant away from traditional stock options primarily to
restricted stock units. these changes will reduce the annual dilution impact
from approximately 1.5% of total outstanding common stock to approximately 1%.
however, associated with the reduction in the number of eligible employees, the
company provided a one-time buyout grant of restricted stock units to the
impacted employees, which resulted in increased stock-based compensation
expense in 2007. stock-based compensation expense totaled $0.18 per diluted
share in 2007, compared with $0.17 per diluted share in 2006. the companys
msop, including restricted stock units, is discussed further in note 15.
the preceding
forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause
results to differ materially from those projected (refer to the forward-looking
statements section in item 7 and the risk factors provided in item 1a for
discussion of these risks and uncertainties).
(note
a). in 2007, gains on sale of businesses and real estate, net of restructuring
and other items, increased operating income by $681 million and net income by
$448 million, or $0.62 per diluted share. 2007 included net benefits from gains related to the sale of businesses
($849 million pre-tax, $550 million after-tax)
and a gain on sale of real estate ($52 million pre-tax, $37 million after-tax),
which were partially offset by increases in environmental liabilities ($134
million pre-tax, $83 million after-tax), restructuring actions ($41 million
pre-tax, $27 million after-tax), and other exit activities ($45 million
pre-tax, $29 million after-tax). these items, except the gain on sale of real
estate, are discussed in more detail in note 2 (acquisitions and divestitures),
note 4 (restructuring actions and other exit activities) and note 13
(commitments and contingencies). gains on sale of businesses include the
second-quarter 2007 sale of 3ms opticom priority control systems and
canoga traffic detection businesses, and the first-quarter 2007 sale of the
global branded pharmaceuticals business in europe. concerning the real estate sale, 3m sold its current lab facility
located in suwon, korea and is currently building a new state-of-the-art
customer-oriented r&d facility closer to seoul and many of 3ms major
customers.
in
2006, gains of sale of businesses, net of restructuring and other items,
increased operating income by $523 million and net income by $438 million, or
$0.57 per diluted share. 2006 included net benefits from gains related to the sale of certain
portions of 3ms branded pharmaceuticals business ($1.074 billion pre-tax, $674
million after-tax) and favorable income tax
adjustments ($149 million), which were partially offset by restructuring
actions ($403 million pre-tax, $257million after-tax), acquired
in-process research and development expenses ($95 million pre-tax and
after-tax), settlement costs of a previously disclosed antitrust class action
($40 million pre-tax, $25 million after-tax), and environmental obligations
related to the pharmaceuticals business ($13 million pre-tax, $8 million
after-tax). these items, except the settlement costs and environmental
obligations, are discussed in more detail in note 2 (acquisitions and
divestitures), note 4 (restructuring actions and other exit activities), note 8
(income taxes) and note 13 (commitments and contingencies). concerning
settlement costs, the company recorded $40 million in 2006 with respect to a
settlement in principle related to the antitrust class action brought on behalf
of direct purchasers who did not purchase private label tape. concerning
environmental obligations, the company increased its reserves by $13 million
during 2006 for estimated environmental remediation costs at a european
pharmaceutical plant.

cost of sales:
cost of sales includes manufacturing, engineering and freight costs.
cost of sales as a percent of net sales increased 1.0 percentage point in 2007
compared to 2006, with this increase primarily due to the sale of the branded
pharmaceuticals business, which had lower than average cost of sales. raw
material costs increased approximately 1% in 2007, compared with 2006. in 2007,
restructuring and other exit costs increased cost of sales by $64 million, or
0.3 percentage points. these charges primarily related to the consolidation of
certain flexible circuit manufacturing operations, the phase-out of operations
at the companys new jersey roofing granule facility and charges
related to the companys decision to close an electro and communications
facility in wisconsin. in 2006, restructuring and other items increased cost of
sales by $143 million, or 0.7 percentage points.
cost of sales increased 1.9 percentage points in 2006. approximately
1.2 percentage points of this increase related to numerous items, such as
higher raw material costs, slightly lower selling prices, and higher costs
associated with scaling up additional manufacturing capacity. in addition,
there were supply chain inefficiencies caused by capacity-constraints. finally,
3m accelerated the pace of acquisitions in 2006, which increased cost of sales
slightly for the year. broad-based sales volume growth and productivity gains
helped offset some of this impact. raw material costs increased approximately
3% for 2006, compared with 2005.
selling, general and administrative
expenses:
selling, general and administrative (sg&a) expenses as a percent of
net sales decreased 1.6 percentage points in 2007 when compared to 2006, as
expenses incurred in 2006 in the companys now-divested global branded
pharmaceuticals business did not repeat in 2007. non-pharmaceutical ongoing
sg&a expenses, after adjusting for the following items, were up
approximately 7% in dollars, reflecting the companys continued investment in
sales and marketing to support growth markets. in 2007, sg&a includes increases in
environmental liabilities, restructuring charges and other exit activities, net
of the gain on sale of real estate ($108 million combined net
expense), which increased sg&a as a percent of sales by 0.4 percentage
points. 2006 included restructuring actions and settlement costs of a previously
disclosed antitrust class action ($238 million combined expense), which increased
2006 sg&a as a percent of sales by 1.0 percentage points. in dollars,
sg&a decreased $51 million when comparing 2007 to 2006, with the change in
restructuring and other items year-on-year decreasing sg&a by $130 million,
pharmaceutical sg&a spending decreasing $241 million and other sg&a
spending increasing $320 million, or approximately 7% in dollars. the company
continues to constrain administrative costs.
sg&a expenses as a percentage of net sales increased 0.2 of a
percentage point in 2006 when compared to 2005. in dollars, sg&a increased
$435 million, with restructuring and other items increasing sg&a by $238
million and other spending increasing sg&a by $197 million. 3m continues to
invest in growth-oriented sg&a as sales and marketing costs increased
faster than sales, while administrative expenses remained relatively flat in dollars,
attributable to ongoing cost-control efforts.
research, development and related
expenses:
research, development and related expenses (r&d) as a percent of
net sales decreased 1.0 percentage point in 2007 when compared to 2006, as
expenses incurred in 2006 in the companys now-divested r&d-intensive
pharmaceuticals business did not repeat in 2007. non-pharmaceutical ongoing
r&d expenses, after adjusting for the following items, were up approximately
11% in dollars, as the company continued to aggressively invest in future
technologies and growth opportunities. 2006 spending included a $95
million in-process research and development charge (discussed in note 2) and
$75 million in restructuring actions (note 4), which increased 2006 r&d as
a percent of sales by 0.7 percentage points. in dollars, r&d spending
decreased $154 million when comparing 2007 to 2006, with the change in
restructuring and other items year-on-year decreasing r&d by $174 million,
2006 pharmaceutical sg&a spending decreasing $120 million and other r&d
spending increasing $140 million, or approximately 11% in dollars, reflecting
3ms continuing commitment to fund future growth for the company.
r&d increased as a percent of sales by 0.6 of a percentage point,
or $248million, when comparing 2006 to 2005. the 2006 spending included a $95
million in-process research and development charge (discussed in note 2) and
$75 million in restructuring actions (note 4). other spending increased
approximately $78million, representing an increase of approximately 6%
compared with 2005.
gain on sale of businesses:
in january2007,
3m completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals business in europe
to meda ab. 3m received proceeds of $817 million for this transaction and
recognized, net of assets sold, a pre-tax gain of $781 million in 2007
(recorded in the health care segment). in june2007, 3m completed the sale
of its opticom priority control systems and canoga traffic detection businesses
to torquest partners inc., a toronto-based investment firm. 3m received
proceeds of $80 million for this transaction and recognized, net of assets
sold, transaction and other costs, a pre-tax gain of $68 million (recorded in
the display and graphics segment) in 2007.
in december2006,
3m completed the sale of its global branded pharmaceuticals businesses in the
united states, canada, and latin america region and the asia pacific region,
including australia and south africa. 3m received proceeds of $1.209 billion
for these transactions and recognized a pre-tax gain on sale of $1.074 billion
in 2006 (recorded in the health care segment). for more detail, refer to note
2.
operating income:
3m uses operating income as one of its primary business segment
performance measurement tools. operating income margins over the past several
years have been in excess of 22%, helped by solid sales growth and an ongoing
strong commitment to maintaining operational discipline throughout 3ms global
operations. operating income margins of 25.3% in 2007 were positively impacted
by 2.8 percentage points ($681 million) from the gain on sale of businesses and
real estate, net of environmental liabilities, restructuring and other exit
activities. operating income margins of 24.8% for 2006 were positively impacted
by 2.2 percentage points ($523 million) from the gain on sale of portions of
the pharmaceuticals business, net of restructuring and other actions. adjusting
for the preceding items, operating income margins in 2007 were similar to 2006.

interest expense: interest expense increased
year-on-year in both 2007 and 2006, primarily due to higher average debt
balances and higher interest rates.
interest income: interest income increased in
2007 due to higher average cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities
balances and higher interest rates. interest income was lower in 2006, with
lower average cash, cash equivalent and marketable securities balances
partially offset by higher interest rates.
provision for income taxes:

33.7
%
the effective tax rate for 2007 was 32.1%, compared with 30.6% in 2006.
the companys 2007 tax rate benefited from reduced international tax rates and
an increased benefit for the domestic manufacturers deduction, but was
penalized by the elimination of the foreign export sales benefit. the companys
2006 tax rate included benefits from adjustments to its reserves for tax
contingencies following the settlement of income tax audits. refer to note 8
for additional information.
the tax rate for 2006 was 30.6%, compared with 33.7% in 2005. as
discussed above, the companys 2006 tax rate included benefits from
adjustments to its reserves for tax contingencies. in 2005, the company
repatriated approximately $1.7billion of foreign earnings under the
american jobs creation act of 2004 (jobs act). the jobs act provided 3m the
opportunity to tax-effectively repatriate foreign earnings for u.s. qualifying
investments specified by 3ms domestic reinvestment plan. as a consequence, in
the second quarter of 2005, 3m recorded a tax expense of $75 million, net of
available foreign tax credits, which negatively impacted the 2005 effective worldwide
tax rate by 1.6%. no similar
repatriation occurred in 2006 since this jobs act provision only applied to
2005.

minority interest expense eliminates the income or loss attributable to
non-3m ownership interests in 3m consolidated entities. 3ms most significant
consolidated entity with non-3m ownership interests is sumitomo 3m limited in
japan (3m owns 75% of sumitomo 3m limited).
cumulative effect of accounting
change:
as of december31,
2005, the company adopted fasb interpretation no.47, accounting for
conditional asset retirement obligations (fin 47). this accounting
standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
where the liability can be reasonably estimated. conditional asset retirement
obligations exist for certain of the companys long-term assets. the fair value
of these obligations is recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis. over
time the liabilities are accreted for the change in the present value and the
initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related
assets. the adoption of fin 47 resulted in the recognition of an asset
retirement obligation liability of $59 million at december31, 2005 and an
after-tax charge of $35 million for 2005, which was reflected as a cumulative
change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of income. at december31,
2007, the asset retirement obligation liability was $59million.
currency effects:
3m estimates that year-on-year currency effects, including hedging
impacts, increased net income by approximately $150million in 2007, $20
million in 2006 and $115 million in 2005. this estimate includes the effect of
translating profits from local currencies into u.s. dollars; the impact of
currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations in the
united states and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including
derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.
3m estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and
losses increased net income by approximately $10 million in 2007, had an
immaterial impact on net income in 2006, and increased net income by
approximately $50 million in 2005.

retrospective method. effective january1, 2006, all prior periods were
revised to give effect to the fair-value-based method of accounting for awards
granted in fiscal years beginning on or after january1, 1995. for additional discussion, refer to note
15. stock-based compensation expense for the years ended december31,

the industrial and transportation segment serves a broad range of
markets, such as appliance, paper and packaging, food and beverage, and
automotive. industrial and transportation products include tapes, a wide variety
of coated and non-woven abrasives, adhesives, specialty materials, filtration
products, closures for disposable diapers, and components and products that are used in the
manufacture, repair and maintenance of automotive, marine, aircraft and specialty
vehicles. the august2005 acquisition of cuno added a comprehensive line
of filtration products for the separation, clarification and purification of
fluids and gases.
in 2007,
local-currency sales increased 5.8%, including 1.8% growth from acquisitions.
during the fourth quarter of 2007, this segment added four complementary
gap-filling acquisitions, bringing total completed acquisitions for the year to
seven. in combination with focused investments in research and development,
these acquisitions will help strengthen the core tapes, adhesives and abrasives
platforms for many years to come. sales growth was broad-based, led by
industrial adhesives and tapes, automotive aftermarket, abrasives and
automotive oem businesses. all geographic areas contributed positively to
growth. significant manufacturing investments were made in emerging economies
such as india, china and poland to simplify the supply chain and get closer to
local customers. good operational discipline helped deliver operating income
growth of 11.8%, with operating income margins of 20.6%. operating income included
$9 million in restructuring and other exit activity expenses, primarily
comprised of severance and related benefits.
in 2006,
local-currency sales grew 9.0%, including 4.6% growth from acquisitions,
primarily related to the august2005 acquisition of cuno. since cuno was
acquired in early august2005 and is thus considered part of organic
growth effective in august2006, the acquisition benefit reflected in 2006
only reflects the months from january2006 through july2006. the
industrial adhesives and tapes business, along with the automotive aftermarket
business, which sells products to body shops for vehicle repairs, led organic
sales growth in 2006. 3m also posted good sales growth in its abrasives
business and its energy and advanced materials business. growth in the
automotive oem business was impacted by softness in the u.s. domestic
automotive industry. geographically, local-currency sales growth in dollars was
strongest in the asia pacific and europe areas. operating income increased
11.0% to $1.342 billion in 2006.
operating income included $15 million in restructuring expenses,
primarily comprised of asset impairments and severance and related benefits,
which negatively impacted operating income growth by 1.2%.
in march2005, 3ms
automotive business completed the purchase of 19% of ti&m
beteiligungsgesellschaft mbh (ti&m) for approximately $55 million. ti&m
is the parent company of i&t innovation technology entwicklungs- und
holding aktiengesellschaft (i&t), an austrian maker of flat flexible cable
and circuitry. pursuant to a shareholders agreement, 3m marketed the firms
flat flexible wiring systems for automotive interior applications to the global
automotive market. i&t filed a petition for bankruptcy protection in august2006.
as part of its agreement to purchase the shares of ti&m, the company was
granted a put option, which gave the company the right to sell back its entire
ownership interest in ti&m to the other investors from whom 3m acquired its
19% interest. the put option became exercisable january1, 2007. the
company exercised the put option and recovered approximately $25 million of its
investment from one of the investors based in belgium in february2007.
the other two ti&m investors have filed a bankruptcy petition in austria.
the company is pursuing recovery of the balance of its investment both through
the austrian bankruptcy proceedings and pursuant to the terms of the share
purchase agreement. the company believes collection of its remaining investment
is probable and, as a result, no impairment reserve has been recorded.

the following
discussion provides information on 3m
health cares remaining businesses (without pharmaceuticals).
in
2007, sales growth was broad-based across all platforms, led by infection
prevention solutions and skin and wound care therapy products in medical,
hfa-based components (non-cfc) for drug inhalers in drug delivery, and
healthcare funding and performance management solutions for the hospital market
in health information systems. geographically, health care (without
pharmaceuticals) achieved strong growth rates in all major regions, led by
europe, the united states, and the combined latin america and canada area.
local-currency sales increased 18.3%, with acquisitions contributing 4.4
percentage points of this growth. much of the acquisition growth came from two
deals that closed in late 2006  biotrace international, plc, a u.k.-based
provider of microbiology products, and softmed, a maryland-based provider of
health information software solutions. health care also closed five
complementary acquisitions in 2007 to strengthen the portfolio and accelerate

businesses. sales growth also included 4.5 percentage points of growth due to
supply agreements related to the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals
business. operating income increased 34.6%, with an operating income margin of

the company sold its branded pharmaceuticals business in the asia pacific
region, including australia and south africa. the company also sold its branded
pharmaceuticals business in the united states, canada and latin america in late
december2006. the operating income gain related to these transactions
totaled $1.074 billion. as discussed in note 4, $112 million of
severance and benefit costs were recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006 related
to worldwide staff overhead reduction actions taken to streamline the companys
cost structure in response to the sale of 3ms branded pharmaceuticals
business. as also discussed in note 4, the pharmaceuticals business
for total year 2006 included $97 million in employee-related severance and
benefits and $69 million of asset impairments and other expenses. in addition,
an environmental reserve of $13 million was recognized related to the
pharmaceuticals business.

the
display and graphics segment serves markets that include electronic display, touch screen,
traffic safety and commercial graphics. this segment includes optical film and
lens solutions for electronic displays; touch screens and touch monitors;
computer screen filters; reflective sheeting for transportation safety; and commercial
graphics systems. the optical film business provides films that serve
numerous market segments of the electronic display industry. 3m provides
distinct products for five market segments, including products for: 1) lcd
computer monitors 2) lcd televisions 3) handheld devices such as cellular
phones 4) notebook pcs and 5) automotive displays. the optical business includes a number of different
products that are protected by various patents and groups of patents. the
remaining lifetimes of such patents, as well as patents protecting future
products, range from less than a few years to more than 10 years. these patents
provide varying measures of exclusivity to 3m for a number of such products. 3ms
proprietary manufacturing technology and know-how also provide a competitive
advantage to 3m with respect to some of these products.
in
2007, display and graphics local-currency sales increased 1.8%, excluding the
impact of the opticom/canoga business sale. the company recorded positive sales
growth in all major businesses  commercial graphics, traffic safety systems
and optical systems. throughout the year, commercial graphics saw strong
performance in the vehicle wrapping market where 3m provides films, inks and
other products for this rolling billboard industry. the traffic safety
systems business also experienced growth for the year, with faster growth
internationally as the 3m reflective solutions for highway construction
projects are a perfect match in developing economies that are adding
infrastructure. in june2007, 3m completed the sale of its opticom
priority control systems and canoga traffic detection businesses. 3m received
proceeds of $80 million from this transaction and recognized an operating
income gain of $68 million in the display and graphics segment in the second
quarter of 2007. in addition, display and graphics recorded restructuring and
other exit activity expenses of $17 million in 2007. operating income in 2007
was $1.174 billion, including this aggregate net operating income benefit of
$51 million, which contributed 1.3 percentage points of the 30.2% operating
income margin. operating income in 2006 (as discussed below) included $39
million in restructuring expenses. these year-on-year impacts contributed 8.7
percentage points of the reported 12.4% operating income growth.
optical systems continues to focus on
market segmentation, with strong penetration in handhelds, computer displays
and lcd televisions. 3m continues to experience
attachment rate pressure in lcd desktop monitors and lcd tv segments, although
in the fourth quarter of 2007 3m saw a mix-shift back to 1080p lcd tvs from
720p, which impacts 3m business as 3m films are used more heavily in the 1080p
sets. 3m believes over the long term that 1080p lcd tvs will gain an
increasing share of the overall lcd tv market. while 3m remains optimistic
about the longer-term prospects for the optical film business, continuing price
and attachment rate pressure is expected in 2008. due to this pressure, 3m expects display and graphics
operating income margins in 2008 to decline a few percentage points when
compared to 2007 (excluding the net operating income benefit of 1.3 percentage
points in 2007 discussed in the preceding paragraph). 3ms
continued investment in this business has led to a solid stream of new
products. 3ms brightness enhancement films provide an environmental solution
through reduced energy consumption  an increasingly important requirement from
both retail customers and government units. 3m has made significant sustainable factory
improvements by relentlessly reducing costs and by adding needed capacity to
secure future growth.
in
2006, the display and graphics business posted local-currency sales growth of
6.0%. optical film sales volumes increased at double-digit rates in 2006. 3m
saw an acceleration in the lcd industry due to strong consumer demand for lcd
tvs, which drove record sales of 3ms proprietary optical films, despite
ongoing downward pricing pressure in these consumer electronic applications.
commercial graphics, a supplier of large-format graphics solutions that cut
across a range of industries, delivered strong double-digit local-currency
growth in 2006. traffic safety systems also posted solid local-currency growth.
operating income declined by 9.0%. operating income included $39 million in
restructuring expenses, primarily comprised of asset impairments and severance
and related benefits, which negatively impacted operating income growth by
3.4%. these asset impairments relate to decisions the company made in the
fourth quarter of 2006 to exit certain marginal product lines in the touch
systems and optical systems businesses. in optical film, selling
price declines, the sales mix shift towards larger lcd displays, and
operational challenges related
to the companys new optical film manufacturing production line penalized
operating income in 2006.

the consumer and office segment serves markets that include consumer
retail, office retail, home improvement, building maintenance and other
markets. products in this segment include office supply products, stationery
products, construction and home improvement products, home care products,
protective material products and consumer health care products.
in
2007, consumer and office experienced broad-based local-currency sales growth
of 5.0%, led by the construction and home improvement and home cleaning
businesses. in construction and home improvement, products such as scotch blue
painters tape, filtrete home
furnace filters and command
mounting and fastening products, helped drive results. geographically,
international growth is gaining traction, while a slowdown in the united states
was driven by soft
overall
u.s. retail sales and a soft residential housing environment. approximately 60%
of global sales for this segment are in the united states. operating income
increased 9.3% and now exceeds 20% of sales.
in
2006, consumer and office local-currency sales growth of 7.4% was broad-based
across the portfolio, led by the construction and home improvement
division, which serves the do-it-yourself retail channel. 3m also posted very
good sales growth in the mass retail channel and continued to penetrate large
key accounts, primarily in the united states, with an array of unique, highly
functional products featuring customer-inspired designs. operating income was
$629million, up 3.4% year on year. 3m experienced slower sales growth in
the construction and home improvement market in the fourth quarter of 2006,
impacted by a housing slowdown in the united states.

the safety, security and protection services segment serves a broad
range of markets that increase the safety, security and productivity of
workers, facilities and systems. major product offerings include personal
protection products, safety and security products, energy control products,
cleaning and protection products for commercial establishments, roofing
granules for asphalt shingles, and supply chain execution software solutions. in august2006,
3m completed the acquisition of security printing and systems limited, a
producer of finished, personalized passports and secure cards, which expands
the 3m product line related to border and civil security solutions. 3ms new emerging
business opportunity in its track and trace initiative within 3ms safety,
security and protection services segment resulted in the merging of a number of
formerly separate efforts into one concerted effort for future growth. track
and trace has a growing array of applications  from tracking packages to
managing medical and legal records.
in 2007, local-currency sales in the safety, security and protection
services segment were up 10.8%. acquisitions contributed 7.4 percentage points
of this growth, including a carry-over benefit from the august2006
acquisition of security printing and systems limited. in addition,
during 2007 3m closed two small, but strategic, gap-filling acquisitions. these
included e. wood, a u.k.-based provider of corrosion protection products and
rochford thompson, a
manufacturer of optical character recognition passport readers used by airlines
and immigration authorities. sales growth
was led by the respiratory protection business, followed by the security
systems, corrosion protection and building and commercial services businesses.
2007 sales growth was held back by market softness in the u.s. residential
construction market, which negatively impacted the roofing granules business. the decline in the roofing granules business
reduced safety, security and protection services 2007 sales growth by
approximately 1.5%. geographically, sales growth was led by europe and the
combined latin america and canada area. this segment recorded a restructuring
charge of $29 million in the second quarter of 2007 related to the
phase-out of operations at its new jersey roofing granule facility. this
included fixed asset impairments and employee-related restructuring liabilities. including this charge, operating income margins
were approximately 20% for total year 2007.
in
2006, local-currency sales in the safety, security and protection services
business were up 13.7%. growth in the business was driven by strong global
demand for personal safety products, especially respiratory protection.
acquisitions contributed 4.1% of growth, primarily due to the security printing
and systems limited acquisition in august2006. 3m continued to invest in
additional respirator capacity, such as a new respirator manufacturing facility
in korea, which will serve the asia pacific region. 3m also posted outstanding
growth in corrosion protection, a smaller but growing business, which supplies
coatings for all types of commercial and industrial applications in a variety
of industries. 3ms roofing granules business experienced a challenging fourth
quarter, with a sales decline of nearly 50%, resulting in sales in this
business declining nearly 10% when comparing total year 2006 with 2005. geographically,
local-currency growth was positive across all regions of the world, led by
europe and the united states. operating income increased
7.1% to $549 million in 2006. operating income includes $10 million in
restructuring expenses, primarily severance and related benefits, which
negatively impacted operating income growth by 1.9%.

the electro and communications segment serves the electrical,
electronics and communications industries, including electrical utilities;
electrical construction, maintenance and repair; oem electrical and
electronics; computers and peripherals; consumer electronics;
telecommunications central office, outside plant and enterprise; as well as
aerospace, military, automotive and medical markets; with products that enable the
efficient transmission of electrical power and speed the delivery of
information and ideas. products include electronic and interconnect solutions,
micro interconnect systems, high-performance fluids, high-temperature and
display tapes, telecommunications products, electrical products, and visual
systems products.
in 2007, the electro and communications segment local-currency sales
increased 2.3%, including 1.5 percentage points from acquisitions. strong sales
growth in the communications and electrical markets businesses was partially
offset by the flexible circuits business, which supplies components primarily
to the ink jet printer market. this business continues to penalize segment
results as the ink jet market has become commoditized and as a number of
applications go end-of-life. softness in this business held back overall
electro and communications sales and operating income growth by 2.5 percent and
9.3 percent, respectively. operating income increased 17% as this segment has
driven productivity improvements and taken actions to improve its
competitiveness. operating income in 2007 was penalized by a $23 million charge
related to consolidating its global flexible circuits manufacturing operations
and $18 million in restructuring expenses, primarily for asset impairment
charges related to the companys decision to close a facility in wisconsin.
combined, these two items negatively impacted 2007 operating income by $41
million and operating income margins by 1.5 percentage points.
in
2006, the electro and communications business organic local-currency growth of
2.7% was attributable to the electrical and electronics markets. acquisitions
contributed 1.3 percentage points to sales growth. 3m generated good top-line
growth in its electrical markets division, which sells a number of insulating,
testing and connecting products and solutions to both power utilities and manufacturing
oems.3m saw good growth from its electronics markets business, driven by
double-digit growth in its semi-conductor and assemblies business. partially
offsetting this was some sales softness in 3ms u.s. communications markets
business due to higher copper costs and a decline in 3ms visual systems
business, which traditionally offered analog overhead and electronic projectors
and film. operating income declined by 2.6% to $411 million. operating income
included $46 million in restructuring expenses, primarily comprised of asset
impairments and severance and related benefits, which negatively impacted
operating income growth by 10.9%. operating margins were
impacted by rising raw material costs, specifically copper costs, in 3ms
electrical and telecommunications markets businesses.
performance by geographic area
financial information related to 3m operations in various geographic
areas is provided in note 17. operating income results by geographic area were
significantly impacted by the gain on sale businesses and other items as
discussed in note a at the end of the preceding overview section. a summary of

while
3m manages its businesses globally and believes its business segment results
are the most relevant measure of performance, the company also utilizes
geographic area data as a secondary performance measure. export sales are
reported within the geographic area where the final sales to 3m customers are
made. a portion of the products or components sold by 3ms operations to
its customers are exported by these customers to different geographic areas. as
customers move their operations from one geographic area to another, 3ms
results will follow. thus, net sales in a particular geographic area are not
indicative of end-user consumption in that geographic area.
u.s. local-currency sales
increased 5.7%, with acquisitions contributing 3.1 percentage points. u.s.
local-currency sales growth was led by health care (without pharmaceuticals)
and industrial and transportation, which was partially offset by softness in
the electronic solutions business and weakness in a few businesses that are
impacted by the slowdown in the u.s. housing, road construction and mass retail
markets, primarily roofing granules, protective materials, traffic safety and
office supply businesses. asia pacific local-currency sales increased 4.9%,
with all six business segments contributing to this increase. sales in japan
totaled approximately $2 billion, with local-currency sales up 2% from 2006. european local-currency sales increased 11.7%,
with good growth across all segments, especially safety, security and
protection services and health care (without pharmaceuticals). in the combined
latin america and canada area, local-currency sales increases of 10.6% were led
by industrial and transportation; safety, security and protection services; and
health care (without pharmaceuticals). foreign currency translation
positively impacted european area sales by 8.5%, the combined latin america and
canada area sales by 5.9%, and the asia pacific area by 2%, as the u.s. dollar
weakened against these currencies. for 2007,
international operations represented approximately 63% of 3ms sales.
since
3m sold its global branded pharmaceuticals business in december2006 and january2007,
both sales growth and operating income were negatively impacted when comparing
2007 to 2006. sales in 2006 for pharmaceuticals totaled $332 million in the
united states, $315 million in the europe, middle east and africa area, $77
million in the asia pacific area, and $50 million in the latin america and
canada area. in 2007, the gain on sale of businesses and a gain
on sale of real estate, net of restructuring and other items, increased
worldwide operating income by $681 million, with the largest impact in the
europe, middle east and africa area. in 2006, the gain on sale, restructuring
and other items increased worldwide operating income by $523 million, with the
largest impact in the united states. these items are discussed in more detail
in the preceding overview section.

employment:
employment increased by approximately 900 people since year-end 2006,
with acquisitions adding approximately 2,500 employees, while restructuring and
the pharmaceuticals divestiture reduced employment. employment increased by
approximately 4,100 people in 2006 compared with 2005, partially due to
acquisitions, with more than 750 people added by 3ms three largest 2006
acquisitions alone. in addition, 3m has increased employees in faster-growing
areas of the world, such as brazil, india, russia, china and poland, where on a
local-currency basis sales increased more than 15% in both 2007 and 2006.
capital spending/net property, plant and equipment:
the bulk of 3m capital spending historically has been in the united
states, resulting in higher net property, plant and equipment balances in the
united states. the company is striving to more closely align its manufacturing
and sourcing with geographic market sales, and because approximately 63% of
sales are outside the united states, this would increase production outside the
united states, helping to improve customer service and reduce working capital
requirements. capital expenditures were $1.422 billion in 2007 and are expected
to total $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in 2008.
critical accounting estimates
information regarding significant accounting policies is included in
note 1. as stated in note 1, the preparation of financial statements requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses, and related disclosure of
contingent assets and liabilities. management bases its estimates on historical
experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under
the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgments
about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily
apparent from other sources. actual results may differ from these estimates.
the company believes its most critical accounting estimates relate to
legal proceedings, the companys pension and postretirement obligations, asset
impairments and income taxes. senior management has discussed the development,
selection and disclosure of its critical accounting estimates with the audit
committee of 3ms board of directors.
legal proceedings:
the categories of claims for which the company has estimated its
probable liability, the amount of its liability accruals, and the estimates of
its related insurance receivables are critical accounting estimates related to
legal proceedings. please refer to the section entitled accrued liabilities
and insurance receivables related to legal proceedings (contained in legal
proceedings in note 13) for additional information about such estimates.
pension and postretirement obligations:
3m has various
company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all u.s. employees
and many employees outside the united states. the company accounts for its
defined benefit pension and postretirement health care and life insurance
benefit plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards
(sfas) no.87, employers accounting for pensions, sfas no.106, employers
accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions, in measuring plan
assets and benefit obligations and in determining the amount of net periodic
benefit cost, and sfas no.158, employers accounting for defined benefit
pension and other postretirement benefit plans an amendment of fasb statements no.87,
88, 106 and 132(r), which was issued in september2006 and effective as
of december31, 2006. sfas no.158 requires employers to recognize
the underfunded or overfunded status of a defined benefit postretirement plan
as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position and recognize
changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur through
accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of stockholders
equity.
pension benefits
associated with these plans are generally based primarily on each participants
years of service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. two
critical assumptions, the discount rate and the expected return on plan assets,
are important elements of expense and liability measurement. the assumed health
care trend rate is the most significant postretirement health care assumption.
see note11 for additional discussion of actuarial assumptions used in
determining pension and postretirement health care liabilities and expenses.
the
company determines the discount rate used to measure plan liabilities as of the
december31 measurement date for the u.s. pension and postretirement
benefit plans. the discount rate reflects the current rate at which the
associated liabilities could be effectively settled at the end of the year. in
estimating this rate, the company looks at rates of return on fixed-income
investments of similar duration to the liabilities in the plan that receive
high, investment grade ratings by recognized ratings agencies. using this
methodology, the company determined a discount rate of 6.00% to be appropriate
as of december31, 2007, which is an increase of 0.25 of a percentage
point from the rate used as of december31, 2006.
a significant element in
determining the companys pension expense in accordance with sfas no.87
is the expected return on plan assets, which is based on historical results for
similar allocations among asset classes. for the u.s. pension plan, the companys
assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 8.75% for 2007 and will
be reduced to 8.50% for 2008. refer to note 11 for information on how this rate
is determined.
for the year ended december31,
2007, the company recognized total consolidated pre-tax pension expense (after
settlements, curtailments and special termination benefits) of $190 million,
down from $347million in 2006. pension expense (before settlements,
curtailments and special termination benefits) is anticipated to decrease to
approximately $90million in 2008. for the pension plans, holding all
other factors constant, an increase/decrease in the expected long-term rate of
return on plan assets of 0.25 of a percentage point would decrease/increase
2008 pension expense by approximately $26million for u.s. pension plans
and approximately $11 million for international pension plans. also, holding
all other factors constant, an increase/decrease in the discount rate used to
measure plan liabilities of 0.25 of a percentage point would decrease/increase
2008 pension expense by approximately $32 million for u.s. pension plans and
approximately $21 million for international pension plans. see note11 for
details of the impact of a one percentage point change in assumed health care
trend rates on the postretirement health care benefit expense and obligation.
asset impairments:
3m net property, plant
and equipment totaled $6.6 billion as of december31, 2007. management
makes estimates and assumptions in preparing the consolidated financial
statements for which actual results will emerge over long periods of time. this
includes the recoverability of long-lived assets employed in the business,
including assets of acquired businesses. these estimates and assumptions are
closely monitored by management and periodically adjusted as circumstances
warrant. for instance, expected asset lives may be shortened or an impairment
recorded based on a change in the expected use of the asset or performance of
the related business reporting unit. impairments recorded in 2007 and 2006
related to restructuring actions and other exit activities are discussed in
note4.
3m goodwill totaled
approximately $4.6 billion as of december31, 2007, which, based on
impairment testing, is not impaired. impairment testing for goodwill is done at
a reporting unit level. reporting units are one level below the business
segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the same segment
have similar economic characteristics. the majority of goodwill relates to and
is assigned directly to a specific reporting unit. an impairment loss generally
would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting units net assets
exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. the estimated fair
value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the reporting unit
multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry groups, or by
using a discounted cash flow analysis.
income taxes:
the extent of 3ms
operations involves dealing with uncertainties and judgments in the application
of complex tax regulations in a multitude of jurisdictions. the final taxes
paid are dependent upon many factors, including negotiations with taxing
authorities in various jurisdictions and resolution of disputes arising from
federal, state, and international tax audits. the company recognizes potential
liabilities and records tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues in the
u.s. and other tax jurisdictions based on its estimate of whether, and the
extent to which, additional taxes will be due. as of january1, 2007, the
company follows fin 48 guidance to record these liabilities (refer to note 8
for additional information). the company adjusts these reserves in light of
changing facts and circumstances; however, due to the complexity of some of
these uncertainties, the ultimate resolution may result in a payment that is
materially different from the companys current estimate of the tax
liabilities. if the companys estimate of tax liabilities proves to be less
than the ultimate assessment, an additional charge to expense would result. if
payment of these amounts ultimately proves to be less than the recorded
amounts, the reversal of the liabilities would result in tax benefits being
recognized in the period when the company determines the liabilities are no
longer necessary.
new accounting pronouncements
information regarding new
accounting pronouncements is included in note 1 to the consolidated financial
statements.
financial condition and liquidity
the company
generates significant ongoing cash flow. increases in long-term debt have been
used, in part, to fund share repurchase activities and acquisitions. on november15,
2007, 3m (safety, security and protection services business) announced that it
had entered into a definitive agreement for 3ms acquisition of 100 percent of
the outstanding shares of aearo holding corp.  a global leader in the
personal protection industry that manufactures and markets personal protection
and energy absorbing products  for approximately $1.2 billion. the sale
is expected to close towards the end of the first quarter of 2008.

cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities at december31, 2007 totaled
approximately $3 billion, helped by strong cash flow generation and by the
timing of debt issuances. at december31, 2006, cash balances were higher
due to the significant pharmaceuticals sales proceeds received in december2006.
3m believes its ongoing cash flows provide ample cash to fund expected
investments and capital expenditures. the company has sufficient access to
capital markets to meet currently anticipated growth and acquisition investment
funding needs. the company does not utilize derivative instruments linked to
the companys stock. however, the company does have contingently convertible
debt that, if conditions for conversion are met, is convertible into shares of
3m common stock (refer to note 10 in this document).
the companys financial condition and liquidity are strong. various assets and
liabilities, including cash and short-term debt, can fluctuate significantly
from month to month depending on short-term liquidity needs. working capital
(defined as current assets minus current liabilities) totaled $4.476 billion at
december31, 2007, compared with $1.623 billion at december31, 2006.
working capital was higher primarily due to increases in cash and cash equivalents,
short-term marketable securities, receivables and inventories and decreases in
short-term debt and accrued income taxes.
the companys liquidity remains strong, with cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities at december31, 2007 totaling
approximately $3 billion. primary short-term liquidity needs are provided
through u.s. commercial paper and euro commercial paper issuances. as of december31,
2007, outstanding total commercial paper issued totaled $349million and
averaged $1.249 billion during 2007. the
company believes it unlikely that its access to the commercial paper market
will be restricted. in june2007, the company established a
medium-term notes program through which up to $3 billion of medium-term notes
may be offered, with remaining shelf borrowing capacity of $2.5 billion as of december31,
2007. on april30, 2007, the company replaced its $565-million credit
facility with a new $1.5-billion five-year credit facility, which has
provisions for the company to request an increase of the facility up to $2
billion (at the lenders discretion), and providing for up to $150 million in
letters of credit. as of december31, 2007, there are $110 million in
letters of credit drawn against the facility. at december31, 2007,
available short-term committed lines of credit internationally totaled
approximately $67million, of which $13 million was utilized. debt
covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends. the company has a well-known
seasoned issuer shelf registration statement, effective february24,
2006, to register an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for
future sales. the company intends to use the proceeds from future
securities sales off this shelf for general corporate purposes.
at
december31, 2007, certain debt agreements ($350 million of dealer
remarketable securities and $87million of esop debt) had ratings triggers
(bbb-/baa3 or lower) that would require repayment of debt. the company has an
aa credit rating, with a stable outlook, from standard& poors and an
aa1 credit rating, with a negative outlook, from moodys investors service. in
addition, under the $1.5-billion five-year credit facility agreement, 3m is
required to maintain its ebitda to interest ratio as of the end of each fiscal
quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. this is calculated (as defined in the
agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total ebitda for the four consecutive
quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same
period. at december31, 2007, this ratio was approximately 35 to 1.
3ms
cash and cash equivalents balance at december31, 2007 totaled $1.896
billion, with an additional $1.059 billion in current and long-term marketable
securities. 3ms strong balance sheet and liquidity provide the company with
significant flexibility to take advantage of numerous opportunities going
forward. the company will continue to invest in its operations to drive growth,
including continual review of acquisition opportunities. as previously discussed, 3m expects to complete
the acquisition of aearo
holding corp. for approximately $1.2 billion in 2008. 3m paid dividends of $1.380 billion in 2007, and has a long history of
dividend increases. in february2008, the board of directors increased the
quarterly dividend on 3m common stock by 4.2% to 50 cents per share, equivalent
to an annual dividend of $2.00 per share. in february2007, 3ms board of
directors authorized a two-year share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion
for the period from february12, 2007 to february28, 2009. at december31,
2007, the company has $4.1 billion remaining under this authorization, which
the company does not currently expect to fully utilize by february28,
2009.
in 2008, the
company expects to contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $400
million to its u.s. and international pension plans. the company does not have
a required minimum pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2008.
therefore, the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary
significantly depending on the u.s.-plans funding status as of the 2008
measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution.
future contributions will also depend on market conditions, interest rates and
other factors. 3m believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it
to fund future pension needs without compromising growth opportunities.
the
company uses various working capital measures that place emphasis and focus on certain
working capital assets and liabilities. these measures are not defined under
u.s. generally accepted accounting principles and may not be computed the same
as similarly titled
measures used by other companies. one of the primary working capital measures 3m uses is a combined index, which includes
accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable. this combined index
(defined as quarterly net sales  fourth quarter at year-end  multiplied by
four, divided by ending net accounts receivable plus inventory less accounts
payable) was 5.3 at december31, 2007, down from 5.4 at december31,
2006. receivables increased $260 million, or 8.4%, compared with december31,
2006. currency translation increased accounts receivable by $159 million
year-on-year, as the u.s. dollar weakened in aggregate against a multitude of
currencies. inventories increased $251 million, or 9.7%, compared with december31,
2006. currency translation increased inventories by $132 million year-on-year.
accounts payable increased $103million compared with december31,
2006, with $65 million of this year-on-year increase related to currency
translation.
cash flows from operating, investing and financing activities are
provided in the tables that follow. individual amounts in the consolidated
statement of cash flows exclude the effects of acquisitions, divestitures and
exchange rate impacts, which are presented separately in the cash flows. thus,
the amounts presented in the following operating, investing and financing
activities tables reflect changes in balances from period to period adjusted
for these effects.

cash flows from
operating activities can fluctuate significantly from period to period, as
pension funding decisions, tax timing differences and other items can
significantly impact cash flows. in both 2007 and 2006, the company made
discretionary contributions of $200 million to its u.s. qualified pension plan,
and in 2005 made discretionary contributions totaling $500 million.
in 2007, cash
flows provided by operating activities increased $436 million, including an
increase in net income of $245 million. since the gain from sale of businesses
is included in and increases net income, the pre-tax gain from the sale of the
businesses must be subtracted, as shown above, to properly reflect operating
cash flows. the cash proceeds from the sale of the pharmaceuticals business are
shown as part of cash from investing activities; however, when the related
taxes are paid they are required to be shown as part of cash provided by
operating activities. thus, operating cash flows for 2007 were penalized due to
cash income tax payments of approximately $630 million in 2007 that related to
the sale of the global branded pharmaceuticals business. non-pharmaceutical
related cash income tax payments were approximately $475 million lower than
2006 due to normal timing differences in tax payments, which benefited cash
flows. accounts receivable and inventory increases reduced cash flows in 2007,
but decreased cash flow less than in 2006, resulting in a year-on-year benefit
to cash flows of $323 million. the category other-net in the preceding table
reflects changes in other asset and liability accounts, including the impact of
cash payments made in connection with 3ms restructuring actions (note 4).
in 2006, cash
flows provided by operating activities decreased $365 million. this decrease
was due in large part to an increase of approximately $600 million in tax
payments in 2006 compared with 2005. the higher tax payments in 2006 primarily
related to the companys repatriation of $1.7 billion of foreign earnings in
the united states pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act
of 2004. the category
other-net in the preceding table reflects changes in other asset and
liability accounts, including outstanding
liabilities at december31, 2006, related to 3ms restructuring actions
(note 4).

investments in
property, plant and equipment enable growth in diverse markets, helping to meet
product demand and increasing manufacturing efficiency. in 2007, numerous
plants were opened or expanded internationally. this included two facilities in
korea (respirator manufacturing facility and optical plant), an optical plant
in poland, industrial adhesives/tapes facilities in both brazil and the
philippines, a plant in russia (corrosion protection, industrial adhesive and
tapes, and respirators), a plant in china (optical systems, industrial
adhesives and tapes, and personal care), an expansion in canada (construction
and home improvement business), in addition to investments in india, mexico and
other countries. in addition, 3m expanded manufacturing capabilities in the
u.s., including investments in industrial adhesives/tapes and optical. 3m also
exited several high-cost underutilized manufacturing facilities and streamlined
several supply chains by relocating equipment from one facility to another. the
streamlining work has primarily occurred inside the u.s. and is in addition to
the streamlining achieved through plant construction. as a result of this
increased activity, capital expenditures were $1.422 billion in 2007, an
increase of $254 million when compared to 2006. the company expects capital
expenditures to total approximately $1.3 billion to $1.4 billion in 2008. refer
to the preceding capital
spending/net property, plant and equipment section for more detail.
refer to note 2 for
information on 2007, 2006 and 2005 acquisitions. note 2 also provides
information on the proceeds from the sale of businesses. the company is actively considering additional
acquisitions, investments and strategic alliances, and from time to time may
also divest certain businesses.
purchases of marketable securities and
investments and proceeds from sale (or maturities) of marketable securities and
investments are primarily attributable to asset-backed securities, agency securities, corporate
medium-term note securities, auction rate securities and other securities, which are classified
as available-for-sale. refer to note 9 for more details about 3ms
diversified marketable securities portfolio, which totaled $1.059 billion as of
december31, 2007. purchases of marketable securities, net of sales and maturities, totaled
$429 million for 2007 and $637 million for 2006. purchases of
investments in 2005 include the purchase of 19% of ti&m beteiligungsgesellschaft
mbh for approximately $55 million, which is reported as investments in the
consolidated balance sheet and as purchases of marketable securities and
investments in the consolidated statement of cash flows. the recovery of
approximately $25 million of this investment in 2007 reduced investments and
is shown in cash flows within proceeds from sale of marketable securities and
investments. this investment is discussed in more detail under the preceding
section
entitled
industrial and transportation business. additional
purchases of investments include
additional survivor benefit insurance and equity investments.

total debt at december31,
2007, was $4.920 billion, up from $3.553 billion at year-end 2006. the net
change in short-term debt is primarily due to commercial paper activity. in
2007, the repayment of debt for maturities greater than 90 days is primarily
comprised of commercial paper repayments of approximately $1.15 billion and the
november2007 redemption of approximately $322 million in convertible
notes. in 2007, proceeds from debt included long-term debt and commercial paper
issuances totaling approximately $4 billion. this was comprised of eurobond
issuances in december2007 and july2007 totaling approximately $1.5
billion in u.s. dollars, a march2007 long-term debt issuance of $750
million and a december2007 fixed rate note issuance of $500 million, plus
commercial paper issuances (maturities greater than 90 days) of approximately
$1.25 billion. increases in long-term debt have been used, in part, to fund
share repurchase activities. the company accelerated purchases of treasury
stock when compared to prior years, buying back $3.2 billion in shares in 2007.
total debt was 30% of total capital (total
capital is defined as debt plus equity),
compared with 26% at year-end 2006.
debt securities, including 2007 debt issuances, the
companys shelf registration, dealer remarketable securities and convertible
notes, are all discussed in more detail in note 10. the company has a well-known
seasoned issuer shelf registration statement, effective february24,
2006, to register an indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for
future sales. on june15, 2007, the company registered 150,718 shares of
the companys common stock under this shelf on behalf of and for the sole
benefit of the selling stockholders in connection with the companys
acquisition of assets of diamond productions,inc. the company intends to
use the proceeds from future securities sales off this shelf for general
corporate purposes. in connection with this shelf registration, in june2007
the company established a medium-term notes program through which up to $3
billion of medium-term notes may be offered. in december2007, 3m issued a
five-year, $500 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of 4.65% under this
medium-term notes program. this program has a remaining capacity of $2.5
billion as of december31, 2007.
the companys $350 million of dealer remarketable securities (classified
as current portion of long-term debt) were remarketed for one year in december2007.
at december31, 2007, $350 million of dealer remarketable securities
(final maturity 2010) and $62 million of floating rate notes (final maturity 2044)
are classified as current portion of long-term debt as the result of put
provisions associated with these debt instruments. the company has convertible
notes with a book value of $222 million at december31, 2007. the next put
option date for these convertible notes is november2012. in november2007,
364,598 outstanding bonds were redeemed resulting in a payout from 3m of
approximately $322 million.
repurchases of common stock are made to support the companys
stock-based employee compensation plans and for other corporate purposes. in february2007, 3ms board of
directors authorized a two-year share repurchase of up to $7.0 billion for the
period from february12, 2007 to february28, 2009. as of december31,
2007, approximately $4.1 billion remained available for repurchase. refer to
the table titled issuer purchases of equity securities in partii, item
5, for more information.
cash dividends
paid to stockholders totaled $1.380 billion ($1.92 per share) in 2007, $1.376
billion ($1.84 per share) in 2006 and $1.286 billion ($1.68 per share) in 2005.
3m has paid dividends since 1916. in february2008,
the board of directors increased the quarterly dividend on 3m common stock by
4.2% to 50 cents per share, equivalent to an annual dividend of $2.00 per
share. this marked the 50th consecutive year of dividend increases. other cash
flows from
financing activities primarily include distributions to minority
interests, excess tax benefits from stock-based compensation, changes in cash
overdraft balances, and principal payments for capital leases.
off-balance sheet arrangements and contractual obligations:
as of december31, 2007, the company has not
utilized special purpose entities to facilitate off-balance sheet financing
arrangements. 3ms accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on the
consolidated balance sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities, are
estimated at approximately $21 million. 3m does not consider this amount to be
material. the fair value of 3m
guarantees of loans with third parties and other guarantee arrangements are not
material.
in addition to
guarantees, 3m, in the normal course of business, periodically enters into
agreements that require the company to indemnify either major customers or
suppliers for specific risks, such as claims for injury or property damage
arising out of the use of 3m products or the negligence of 3m personnel, or
claims alleging that 3m products infringe third-party patents or other intellectual
property. while 3ms maximum exposure under these indemnification provisions
cannot be estimated, these indemnifications are not expected to have a material
impact on the companys consolidated results of operations or financial
condition.

long-term debt payments
due in 2008 include $350 million of dealer remarketable securities (final maturity
2010) and $62 million of floating rate notes (final maturity 2044). these
securities are classified as the current portion of long-term debt as the
result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments.
unconditional purchase
obligations are defined as an agreement to purchase goods or services that is
enforceable and legally binding on the company. included in the unconditional
purchase obligations category above are certain obligations related to take or
pay contracts, capital commitments, service agreements and utilities. these
estimates include both unconditional purchase obligations with terms in excess
of one year and normal ongoing purchase obligations with terms of less than one
year. many of these commitments relate to take or pay contracts, in which 3m
guarantees payment to ensure availability of products or services that are sold
to customers. the company expects to receive consideration (products or
services) for these unconditional purchase obligations. contractual capital commitments are included in the preceding table, but
these commitments represent a small part of the companys expected capital
spending in 2008 and beyond. the purchase obligation amounts do not
represent the entire anticipated purchases in the future, but represent only
those items for which the company is contractually obligated. the majority of
3ms products and services are purchased as needed, with no unconditional
commitment. for this reason, these amounts will not provide a reliable
indicator of the companys expected future cash outflows on a stand-alone
basis.
other obligations, included in the preceding table within the caption
entitled unconditional purchase obligations and other, include the current
portion of the liability for uncertain tax positions under fin 48. the company
is not able to reasonably estimate the timing of the long-term payments or the
amount by which the liability will increase or decrease over time; therefore,
the long-term portion of the liability of $304 million is excluded from the
preceding table. refer to note 8 for further details.
as
discussed in note 11, the company does not have a required minimum pension
contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2008 and company contributions to
its u.s. and international pension plans are expected to be largely
discretionary in 2008 and future years; therefore, amounts related to these
plans are not included in the preceding table.
financial instruments
the company enters into contractual derivative arrangements in the
ordinary course of business to manage foreign currency exposure, interest rate
risks and commodity price risks. a financial risk management committee,
composed of senior management, provides oversight for risk management and
derivative activities. this committee determines the companys financial risk
policies and objectives, and provides guidelines for derivative instrument
utilization. this committee also establishes procedures for control and
valuation, risk analysis, counterparty credit approval, and ongoing monitoring
and reporting.
the company enters into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and
swaps to hedge against the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows
denominated in foreign currencies and certain intercompany financing
transactions. the company manages interest rate risks using a mix of fixed and
floating rate debt. to help manage borrowing costs, the company may enter into
interest rate swaps. under these arrangements, the company agrees to exchange,
at specified intervals, the difference between fixed and floating interest
amounts calculated by reference to an agreed-upon notional principal amount.
the company manages commodity price risks through negotiated supply contracts,
price protection agreements and forward physical contracts.
a monte carlo simulation technique was used to test the companys
exposure to changes in currency and interest rates and assess the risk of loss
or benefit in after-tax earnings of financial instruments, derivatives and
underlying exposures outstanding at december31, 2007. the model
(third-party bank dataset) used a 95% confidence level over a 12-month time
horizon. the model used analyzed 17 currencies, interest rates related to three
currencies, and five commodities, but does not purport to represent what
actually will be experienced by the company. this model does not include
certain hedge transactions, because the company believes their inclusion would
not materially impact the results. the following table summarizes the possible
adverse and positive impacts to after-tax earnings related to these exposures.

the
global exposures related to purchased components and materials are such that a
1% price change would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $60
million per year. the global energy exposure is such that a 10% price change
would result in a pre-tax cost or savings of approximately $38 million per
year. derivative instruments are used to hedge approximately 1% of the
purchased components and materials exposure and are used to hedge approximately
10% of this energy exposure.
forward-looking statements
this annual report on form10-k, including managements
discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in
item 7, contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the private
securities litigation reform act of 1995. the company may also make
forward-looking statements in other reports filed with the securities and
exchange commission, in materials delivered to stockholders and in press
releases. in addition, the companys representatives may from time to time make
oral forward-looking statements.
forward-looking statements relate to future events and typically
address the companys expected future business and financial performance. words
such as plan, expect, aim, believe,
project, target, anticipate, intend, estimate, will, should, could
and other words and terms of similar meaning, typically identify such
forward-looking statements. in particular, these include statements about the
companys strategy for growth, product development, market position, future
performance or results of current or anticipated products, interest rates,
foreign exchange rates, financial results, and the outcome of contingencies,
such as legal proceedings. the company assumes no obligation to update or
revise any forward-looking statements.
forward-looking
statements are based on certain assumptions and expectations of future events
and trends that are subject to risks and uncertainties. actual future results
and trends may differ materially from historical results or those reflected in
any such forward-looking statements depending on a variety of factors. discussion of these factors is
incorporated by reference from parti, item 1a, risk factors, of this
document, and should be considered an integral part of partii, item 7, managements discussion
and analysis of financial condition and results of operations.
item 7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk.
in
the context of item 7a, market risk refers to the risk of loss arising from
adverse changes in financial and derivative instrument market rates and prices,
such as fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. the
company discusses risk management in various places throughout this document,
including discussions in item 7 concerning financial condition and liquidity,
and financial instruments, and in the notes to consolidated financial
statements (long-term debt and short-term borrowings, derivatives and other
financial instruments, and the derivatives and hedging activities accounting
policy). all derivative activity is governed by written policies, and a value-at-risk
analysis is provided for these derivatives. the company does not have leveraged
derivative positions. however, the company does have contingently convertible
debt that, if conditions for conversion are met, is convertible into shares of
3m common stock (refer to note 10 in this document).

managements responsibility for
financial reporting
management is responsible for the integrity and
objectivity of the financial information included in this report. the financial
statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles
generally accepted in the united states of america. where necessary, the
financial statements reflect estimates based on managements judgment.
management has established and maintains a system of
internal accounting and other controls for the company and its subsidiaries.
this system and its established accounting procedures and related controls are
designed to provide reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded, that the
books and records properly reflect all transactions, that policies and
procedures are implemented by qualified personnel, and that published financial
statements are properly prepared and fairly presented. the companys system of
internal control is supported by widely communicated written policies,
including business conduct policies, which are designed to require all
employees to maintain high ethical standards in the conduct of company affairs.
internal auditors continually review the accounting and control system.
3m company
managements
report on internal control over financial reporting
management is responsible for establishing and
maintaining an adequate system of internal control over financial reporting.
management conducted an assessment of the companys internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework established by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control  integrated framework.
based on the assessment, management concluded that, as of december31,
2007, the companys internal control over financial reporting is effective.
the companys internal
control over financial reporting as of december31, 2007 has been audited
by pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered public accounting
firm, as stated in their report which is included herein, which expresses an
unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the companys internal control over
financial reporting as of december31, 2007.
3m company
report of independent
registered public accounting firm
to the
stockholders and board of directors of 3m company:
in our opinion, the consolidated financial statements listed in
the accompanying index present
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of 3m company and its
subsidiaries (the company) at december31, 2007 and 2006, and the
results of their operations and their cash flows for each of the three years in
the period ended december31, 2007 in conformity with accounting
principles generally accepted in the united states of america. also in our
opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal
control over financial reporting as of december31, 2007, based on
criteria established in internal control
integrated framework issued by the committee of sponsoring
organizations of the treadway commission (coso). the companys management is
responsible for these financial statements, for maintaining effective internal
control over financial reporting and for its assessment of the effectiveness of
internal control over financial reporting, included in managements report on
internal control over financial reporting in the accompanying index. our
responsibility is to express opinions on these financial statements and on the
companys internal control over financial reporting based on our integrated
audits. we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public
company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require
that we plan and perform the audits to obtain reasonable assurance about
whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement and whether
effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all
material respects. our audits of the financial statements included examining,
on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial statement
presentation. our audit of internal control over financial reporting included
obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting,
assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, and testing and evaluating
the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the
assessed risk. our audits also included performing such other procedures as we
considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinions.
as discussed in note 1 to
the consolidated financial statements, the company changed the manner in which
it accounts for conditional asset retirement obligations in 2005, the manner in
which it accounts for defined benefit pension and other post-retirement plans
in 2006, and the manner in which it accounts for uncertain tax positions in
2007.
a companys internal
control over financial reporting is a process designed to provide reasonable
assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation
of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally
accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial
reporting includes those policies and procedures that (i)pertain to the
maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly
reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii)provide
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit
preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted
accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are
being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors
of the company; and (iii)provide reasonable assurance regarding
prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition
of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial
statements.
because of its inherent
limitations, internal control over financial reporting may not prevent or
detect misstatements. also, projections
of any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that
the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.

notes to
consolidated financial statements
note 1. significant accounting
policies
consolidation: 3m is a diversified global manufacturer,
technology innovator and marketer of a wide variety of products. all
significant subsidiaries are consolidated. all significant intercompany
transactions are eliminated. as used herein, the term 3m or company refers
to 3m company and subsidiaries unless the context indicates otherwise.
foreign currency translation: local currencies generally are
considered the functional currencies outside the united states. assets and
liabilities for operations in local-currency environments are translated at
year-end exchange rates. income and expense items are translated at average
rates of exchange prevailing during the year. cumulative translation
adjustments are recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) in stockholders equity.
reclassifications:
certain amounts in the prior years consolidated financial statements
have been
reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.
use of estimates: the preparation of financial statements in
conformity with u.s. generally accepted accounting principles requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts
of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and
liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and the reported amounts
of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. actual results could
differ from these estimates.
cash and cash equivalents: cash and cash equivalents
consist of cash and temporary investments with maturities of three months or
less when purchased.
investments: investments primarily include the cash surrender value
of life insurance policies, real estate not used in the business, venture
capital and equity-method investments. unrealized gains and losses relating to
investments classified as available-for-sale are recorded as a component of
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) in stockholders equity.
inventories: inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market,
with cost generally determined on a first-in, first-out basis.
property,
plant and equipment: property, plant and equipment, including capitalized
interest and internal engineering costs, are recorded at cost. depreciation of
property, plant and equipment generally is computed using the straight-line
method based on the estimated useful lives of the assets. the estimated useful
lives of buildings and improvements primarily range from 10 to 40 years, with
the majority in the range of 20 to 40 years. the estimated useful lives of
machinery and equipment primarily range from three to 15 years, with the
majority in the range of five to 10 years. fully depreciated assets are
retained in property and accumulated depreciation accounts until disposal. upon
disposal, assets and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the
accounts and the net amount, less proceeds from disposal, is charged or
credited to operations. property, plant and equipment amounts are reviewed for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment
loss would be recognized when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the
estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the
asset and its eventual disposition. the amount of the impairment loss to be
recorded is calculated by the excess of the assets carrying value over its
fair value. fair value is generally determined using a discounted cash flow
analysis.
goodwill: goodwill
is the excess of cost of an acquired entity over the amounts assigned to assets
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination. goodwill is not
amortized. goodwill is tested for impairment annually, and will be tested for
impairment between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that
would indicate the carrying amount may be impaired. impairment testing for
goodwill is done at a reporting unit level. reporting units are one level below
the business segment level, but can be combined when reporting units within the
same segment have similar economic characteristics. the majority of goodwill
relates to and is assigned directly to specific reporting units. an impairment
loss generally would be recognized when the carrying amount of the reporting
units net assets exceeds the estimated fair value of the reporting unit. the
estimated fair value of a reporting unit is determined using earnings for the
reporting unit multiplied by a price/earnings ratio for comparable industry
groups, or by using a discounted cash flow analysis. the company completed its
annual goodwill impairment test in the fourth quarter of 2007 and determined
that no goodwill was impaired.
intangible
assets: intangible
assets include patents, tradenames and other intangible assets acquired from an
independent party. intangible assets with an indefinite life, namely certain
tradenames, are not amortized. intangible assets with a definite life are
amortized on a straight-line basis, with estimated useful lives ranging from
one to 20 years. indefinite-lived intangible assets are tested for impairment
annually, and will be tested for impairment between annual tests if an event
occurs or circumstances change that would indicate that the carrying amount may
be impaired. intangible assets with a definite life are tested for impairment
whenever events or circumstances indicate that the
carrying amount of an
asset (asset group) may not be recoverable. an impairment loss is recognized
when the carrying amount of an asset exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash
flows used in determining the fair value of the asset. the amount of the
impairment loss to be recorded is calculated by the excess of the assets
carrying value over its fair value. fair value is generally determined using a
discounted cash flow analysis. costs related to internally developed intangible
assets, such as patents, are expensed as incurred, primarily in research,
development and related expenses.
revenue (sales) recognition: the company sells a wide range
of products to a diversified base of customers around the world and has no
material concentration of credit risk. revenue is recognized when the risks and rewards
of ownership have substantively transferred to customers. this condition
normally is met when the product has been delivered or upon performance of
services. the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer and
distributor incentives, such as rebates, at the time of the initial sale. the
estimated reductions are based on the sales terms, historical experience, trend
analysis and projected market conditions in the various markets served. sales, use,
value-added and other excise taxes are not recognized in revenue.
the majority of 3ms sales agreements are for standard products and
services with customer acceptance occurring upon delivery of the product or
performance of the service. 3m also enters into agreements that contain
multiple elements (such as equipment, installation and service) or non-standard
terms and conditions. for multiple-element arrangements, 3m recognizes revenue
for delivered elements when it has stand-alone value to the customer, the fair
values of undelivered elements are known, customer acceptance of the delivered
elements has occurred, and there are only customary refund or return rights
related to the delivered elements. in addition to the preceding conditions,
equipment revenue is
not recorded until the installation has been completed if equipment acceptance
is dependent upon installation, or if installation is essential to the
functionality of the equipment. installation revenues are not recorded until
installation has been completed. for prepaid service contracts, sales revenue
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the contract, unless
historical evidence indicates the costs are incurred on other than a
straight-line basis. license fee revenue is recognized as earned, and no
revenue is recognized until the inception of the license term. on occasion, agreements will contain milestones,
or 3m will recognize revenue based on proportional performance. for these
agreements, and depending on the specifics, 3m may recognize revenue upon
completion of a substantive milestone, or in proportion to costs incurred to
date compared with the estimate of total costs to be incurred.
accounts
receivable and allowances: trade accounts receivable are recorded at the invoiced
amount and do not bear interest. the company maintains allowances for bad
debts, cash discounts, product returns and various other items. the allowance
for doubtful accounts and product returns is based on the best estimate of the
amount of probable credit losses in existing accounts receivable and
anticipated sales returns. the company determines the allowances based on
historical write-off experience by industry and regional economic data and
historical sales returns. the company reviews the allowance for doubtful
accounts monthly. the company does not have any significant off-balance-sheet
credit exposure related to its customers.
advertising and merchandising: these costs are charged to
operations in the year incurred, and totaled $469 million in 2007, $471 million
in 2006 and $457 million in 2005.
research, development and related expenses: these costs are
charged to operations in the year incurred and are shown on a separate line of
the consolidated statement of income. research, development and related
expenses totaled $1.368 billion in 2007, $1.522 billion in 2006 and $1.274
billion in 2005. in 2006, this included a $95 million in-process research and
development charge (discussed in note 2) and $75 million in restructuring
actions (note 4). research and development expenses, covering basic scientific
research and the application of scientific advances in the development of new
and improved products and their uses, totaled $788 million in 2007 compared to
$943 million in 2006, decreasing due to the $95 million for purchased
in-process research and development discussed above and also due to the
pharmaceuticals business divestiture (note 2). research and development
expenses totaled $818 million in 2005. related expenses primarily include
technical support provided by 3m to customers who are using existing 3m
products, and internally developed patent costs, which include costs and fees incurred to prepare, file,
secure and maintain patents.
internal-use software: the company capitalizes direct
costs of materials and services used in the development of internal-use
software. amounts capitalized are amortized on a straight-line basis over a
period of three to five years and are reported as a component of machinery and
equipment within property, plant and equipment.
environmental: environmental
expenditures relating to existing conditions caused by past operations that do
not contribute to current or future revenues are expensed. reserves for
liabilities for anticipated remediation costs are recorded on an undiscounted
basis when they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than
the completion of feasibility studies or the companys commitment to a plan of
action. environmental
expenditures for capital projects that contribute to current or future
operations generally are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated
useful lives.
income taxes: the provision for income taxes is determined
using the asset and liability approach. under this approach, deferred income
taxes represent the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts and tax basis of assets and liabilities. the
company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets when
uncertainty regarding their reliability exists. as of december31, 2007,
no significant valuation allowances were recorded.
earnings per share:
the difference in the weighted average shares outstanding for calculating basic
and diluted earnings per share is attributable to the dilution associated with
the companys stock-based compensation plans. certain management stock
ownership program average options outstanding during the years 2007, 2006 and
2005 were not included in the computation of diluted earnings per share because
they would not have had a dilutive effect (21.6 million average options for

convertible notes have never been met. if the conditions for conversion are
met, 3m may choose to pay in cash and/or common stock;
however, if this occurs, the company has the intent and ability to settle this

stock-based
compensation: in december2004,
the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued sfas no.123
(revised 2004). sfas no.123r supersedes apb opinion no.25. under
apb opinion no.25, no compensation expense is recognized for employee
stock option grants if the exercise price of the companys stock option grants
is at or above the fair market value of the underlying stock on the date of
grant. under sfas no.123r, compensation expense is recognized for both
the general employees stock purchase plan (gespp) and the management stock
ownership plan (msop). sfas no.123r requires the determination of the
fair value of the share-based compensation at the grant date and the
recognition of the related expense over the period in which the share-based
compensation vests. the company adopted sfas no.123r effective january1,
2006. the company adopted sfas no.123r using the modified retrospective
method. all prior periods have been restated to give effect to the
fair-value-based method of accounting for awards granted in fiscal years
beginning on or after january1, 1995. the company believes that the
modified retrospective application of this standard achieves the highest level
of clarity and comparability among the presented periods. on november10,
2005, the fasb issued fasb staff position no.fas 123(r)-3, transition
election related to accounting for the tax effects of share-based payment
awards (the fsp). the fsp provides that companies may elect to use a specified short-cut
method to calculate the historical pool of windfall tax benefits upon adoption
of sfas no.123r. the company elected to use the short-cut method when
it adopted sfas no.123r on january1, 2006. refer to note 15 for
additional information.
comprehensive income: total comprehensive income and
the components of accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) are presented
in the consolidated statement of changes in stockholders equity and
comprehensive income. accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) is composed
of foreign currency translation effects (including hedges of net investments in
international companies), defined benefit pension plan adjustments, unrealized
gains and losses on available-for-sale debt and equity securities, and
unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedging instruments.
derivatives
and hedging activities: all derivative instruments are
recorded on the balance sheet at fair value. the company uses interest rate swaps,
currency swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally
associated
with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity market volatility. all
hedging instruments that qualify for hedge accounting are designated and
effective as hedges, in accordance with u.s. generally accepted accounting
principles. if the underlying hedged transaction ceases to exist, all changes
in fair value of the related derivatives that have not been settled are
recognized in current earnings. instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting
are marked to market with changes recognized in current earnings. the company
does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes
and is not a party to leveraged derivatives. however, the company does have contingently convertible
debt that, if conditions for conversion are met, is convertible into shares of
3m common stock (refer to note 10 in this document).
new accounting pronouncements
as of december31,
2005, the company adopted fasb interpretation no.47, accounting for
conditional asset retirement obligations (fin 47). this accounting
standard applies to the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement
obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long-lived assets and
where the liability can be reasonably estimated. conditional asset retirement
obligations exist for certain of the companys long-term assets. the fair value
of these obligations is recorded as liabilities on a discounted basis. over
time the liabilities are accreted for the change in the present value and the
initial capitalized costs are depreciated over the useful lives of the related
assets. the adoption of fin 47 effective december31, 2005, resulted in
the recognition of an asset retirement obligation liability of $59 million at december31,
2005, and an after-tax charge of $35 million for 2005, which is reflected as a
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the consolidated
statement of income. at december31, 2007, the asset retirement obligation
liability was $59 million.
in february2006,
the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards (sfas) no.155,
hybrid instruments. sfas no.155
amends sfas no.133 and sfas no.140, accounting for transfers and
servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities. sfas no.155
also resolves issues addressed in statement 133 implementation issue no.d1,
application of statement 133 to beneficial interests in securitized financial
assets. sfas no.155: a) permits fair value remeasurement for any hybrid
financial instrument that contains an embedded derivative that otherwise would
require bifurcation, b) clarifies which interest-only strips and principal-only
strips are not subject to the requirements of sfas no.133, c) establishes
a requirement to evaluate interests in securitized financial assets to identify
interests that are freestanding derivatives or that are hybrid financial
instruments that contain an embedded derivative requiring bifurcation, d)
clarifies that concentrations of credit risk in the form of subordination are
not embedded derivatives, and e) amends sfas no.140 to eliminate the
prohibition on a qualifying special purpose entity from holding a derivative
financial instrument that pertains to a beneficial interest other than another
derivative financial instrument. the company adopted sfas no.155
effective january1, 2007; however, there was no material impact.
in june2006,
the fasb issued interpretation no.48 (fin 48), accounting for
uncertainty in income taxes, an interpretation of fasb statement no.109.
this interpretation was effective as of january1, 2007. refer to note 8
for additional information concerning this standard.
in september2006,
the fasb issued sfas no.157, fair value measurements. sfas no.157
establishes a single definition of fair value and a framework for measuring
fair value, sets out a fair value hierarchy to be used to classify the source
of information used in fair value measurements, and requires new disclosures of
assets and liabilities measured at fair value based on their level in the
hierarchy. sfas no.157 is effective for all fiscal years beginning after november15,
2007 (january1, 2008 for 3m) and is to be applied prospectively. in
february 2008, the fasb issued staff positions no. 157-1 and no. 157-2 which
partially defer the effective date of sfas no. 157 for one year for certain
nonfinancial assets and liabilities and remove certain leasing transactions
from its scope. the company is currently evaluating the impacts and disclosures
of this standard, but would not expect sfas no.157 to have a material
impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in september2006,
the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued sfas no.158, employers
accounting for defined benefit pension and other postretirement plans, an
amendment of fasb statements no.87, 88, 106 and 132(r). refer to note 11
for additional information concerning this standard.
in february2007,
the fasb issued sfas no.159, the fair value option for financial assets
and financial liabilities. sfas no.159 permits an entity to choose, at
specified election dates, to measure eligible financial instruments and certain
other items at fair value that are not currently required to be measured at
fair value. an entity shall report unrealized gains and losses on items for
which the fair value option has been elected in earnings at each subsequent
reporting date. upfront costs and fees related to items for which the fair
value option is elected shall be recognized in earnings as incurred and not
deferred. sfas no.159 also establishes presentation and disclosure
requirements designed to facilitate comparisons between entities that choose
different measurement attributes for similar types of assets and liabilities.
sfas no.159 is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years
beginning after november15, 2007 (january1, 2008 for 3m) and
interim periods within those fiscal years. at the
effective date, an entity
may elect the fair value option for eligible items that exist at that date. the
entity shall report the effect of the first remeasurement to fair value as a
cumulative-effect adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings. the company
has not elected the fair value option for eligible items that existed as of january1,
2008.
in june2007, the
fasbs emerging issues task force reached a consensus on eitf issue no.07-3,
accounting for nonrefundable advance payments for goods or services to be used
in future research and development activities that would require nonrefundable
advance payments made by the company for future r&d activities to be
capitalized and recognized as an expense as the goods or services are received
by the company. eitf issue no.07-3 is effective for 3m with respect to
new arrangements entered into beginning january1, 2008. the company is
currently evaluating the impacts and disclosures of this standard, but would
not expect eitf issue no.07-3 to have a material impact on 3ms
consolidated results of operations or financial condition.
in december2007,
the fasb issued sfas no.141r, business combinations, which changes how
business acquisitions are accounted.
sfas no.141r requires the acquiring entity in a business
combination to recognize all (and only) the assets acquired and liabilities
assumed in the transaction and establishes the acquisition-date fair value as
the measurement objective for all assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a
business combination. certain provisions
of this standard will, among other things, impact the determination of
acquisition-date fair value of consideration paid in a business combination
(including contingent consideration); exclude transaction costs from acquisition
accounting; and change accounting practices for acquired contingencies,
acquisition-related restructuring costs, in-process research and development,
indemnification assets, and tax benefits.
for 3m, sfas no.141r is effective for business combinations and
adjustments to an acquired entitys deferred tax asset and liability balances
occurring after december31, 2008.
the company is currently evaluating the future impacts and disclosures
of this standard.
in december2007,
the fasb issued sfas no.160, noncontrolling interests in consolidated
financial statements, an amendment of arb no.51, which establishes new
standards governing the accounting for and reporting of noncontrolling
interests (ncis) in partially owned consolidated subsidiaries and the loss of
control of subsidiaries. certain
provisions of this standard indicate, among other things, that ncis (previously
referred to as minority interests) be treated as a separate component of
equity, not as a liability; that increases and decrease in the parents
ownership interest that leave control intact be treated as equity transactions,
rather than as step acquisitions or dilution gains or losses; and that losses
of a partially owned consolidated subsidiary be allocated to the nci even when
such allocation might result in a deficit balance. this standard also requires
changes to certain presentation and disclosure requirements. for 3m, sfas no.160
is effective beginning january1, 2009. the provisions of the standard are
to be applied to all ncis prospectively, except for the presentation and
disclosure requirements, which are to be to applied retrospectively to all
periods presented. the company is currently evaluating the future impacts and
disclosures of this standard.
in december2007,
the fasb ratified the emerging issues task force consensus on eitf issue no.07-1,
accounting for collaborative arrangements that discusses how parties to a
collaborative arrangement (which does not establish a legal entity within such
arrangement) should account for various activities. the consensus indicates
that costs incurred and revenues generated from transactions with third parties
(i.e. parties outside of the collaborative arrangement) should be reported by
the collaborators on the respective line items in their income statements
pursuant to eitf issue no.99-19, reporting revenue gross as a principal
versus net as an agent. additionally,
the consensus provides that income statement characterization of payments
between the participants in a collaborative arrangement should be based upon
existing authoritative pronouncements; analogy to such pronouncements if not
within their scope; or a reasonable, rational, and consistently applied
accounting policy election. eitf issue no.07-1 is effective for 3m beginning
january1, 2009 and is to be applied retrospectively to all periods
presented for collaborative arrangements existing as of the date of adoption.
the company is currently evaluating the impacts and disclosures of this
standard, but would not expect eitf issue no.07-1 to have a material
impact on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition.

balances by business segment as presented below. for those changes that
resulted in reporting unit changes, the company applied the relative fair value
method to determine the impact to reporting units. sfas no.142, goodwill
and other intangible assets, requires that goodwill be tested for impairment
at least annually and when reporting units are changed.
purchased goodwill from acquisitions totaled $326
million in 2007, $55 million of which is deductible for tax purposes. purchased
goodwill from acquisitions totaled $536 million in 2006, $41 million of which
is deductible for tax purposes. the sale of 3ms global branded pharmaceuticals
business (health care) resulted in the write-off of $54 million in goodwill, which
is reflected in the 2006 translation and other column below. changes in foreign
currency exchange rates impacted both 2007 and 2006 goodwill balances. the goodwill

note 4. restructuring actions
and other exit activities
restructuring actions:
during the fourth quarter of 2006 and the
first six months of 2007, management approved and committed to undertake the
following restructuring actions:
pharmaceuticals
business actions -
employee-related, asset impairment and other costs pertaining to the companys
exit of its branded pharmaceuticals operations. these costs included severance
and benefits for pharmaceuticals business employees who are not obtaining
employment with the buyers as well as impairment charges associated with
certain assets not transferred to the buyers.
overhead reduction actions - employee-related costs
for severance and benefits, costs associated with actions to reduce the companys
cost structure.
business-specific actions - employee-related costs for
severance and benefits, fixed and intangible asset impairments, certain
contractual obligations, and expenses from the exit of certain product lines.

actions with respect to the above activities were substantially
completed in 2007 and additional charges and adjustments are not expected to be
material.
in connection with this targeted restructuring plan, the company
eliminated a total of approximately 1,900 positions from various functions
within the company. approximately 390 positions were pharmaceuticals business
employees, approximately 960 positions related primarily to corporate staff
overhead reductions, and approximately 550 positions were business-specific
reduction actions. of the 1,900 employment reductions, about 58% are in the
united states, 21% in europe, 12% in latin america and canada, and 9% in the
asia pacific area. as a result of the second-quarter 2007 phase-out of
operations at a new jersey roofing granule facility and the sale of the companys
opticom priority
control systems and canoga traffic detection businesses,
the company eliminated approximately 100 additional positions.
employee-related severance charges are largely based upon distributed
employment policies and substantive severance plans and were reflected in the
quarter in which management approved the restructuring actions. severance
amounts for which affected employees were required to render service in order
to receive benefits at their termination dates were measured at the date such
benefits were communicated to the applicable employees and recognized as
expense over the employees remaining service periods.
non-cash employee-related changes in 2007 and 2006 primarily relate to
special termination pension and medical benefits granted to certain u.s.
eligible employees. these pension and medical benefits were reflected as a
component of the benefit obligation of the companys pension and medical plans
as of december31, 2007 and 2006. in addition, these changes also reflect
non-cash stock option expense due to the reclassification of certain employees
age 50 and older to retiree status, resulting in a modification of their
original stock option awards for accounting purposes.
contract termination and other charges primarily reflect costs to
terminate a contract before the end of its term (measured at fair value at the
time the company provided notice to the counterparty) or costs that will
continue to be incurred under the contract for its remaining term without
economic benefit to the company.
business-specific asset impairment charges for 2007 totaled $35
million. this included charges of $24 million related to property, plant and
equipment associated with the companys decision to phase-out operations at a
new jersey roofing granule facility (safety, security and protection services
segment) and charges of $11 million ($10 million related to property, plant and
equipment and $1 million related to intangible assets) related to the companys
decision to close an electro and communications facility in wisconsin. asset
impairment charges related to intangible assets and property, plant and
equipment reflect the excess of the assets carrying values over their fair
values.
asset impairment charges in 2006 associated with the pharmaceuticals
business and business-specific actions include $109 million relative to
property, plant and equipment; $30 million relative to intangible assets; and
$5 million relative to other assets. impairment charges relative to intangible
assets and property, plant and equipment reflect the excess of the assets
carrying values over their fair values as discussed in note 1. the
pharmaceuticals business asset impairment charges are for certain assets not
transferred to the buyers and primarily relate to the write-down of the assets
to salvage value. the business-specific asset impairment charges primarily
relate to decisions the company made in the fourth quarter of 2006 to exit
certain marginal product lines in the display and graphics segment and electro
and communications segment.
other exit activities:
during the second half of 2007, the company recorded net pre-tax charges
of $45 million related to exit activities. these charges related to employee
reductions and fixed asset impairments, including the consolidation of certain
flexible circuit manufacturing operations ($23 million recorded in the electro
and communications segment) and other actions, primarily in the display and
graphics segment and industrial and transportation segment. these charges were
recorded in cost of sales and selling, general and administrative expenses and
research, development and related expenses.

in september2006,
the fasb issued sfas no.158, employers accounting for defined benefit
pension and other postretirement plans, an amendment of fasb statements no.87,
88, 106 and 132(r). this standard eliminated the requirement for a minimum
pension liability adjustment that was previously required under sfas no.87
and required employers to recognize the underfunded or overfunded status of a
defined benefit plan as an asset or liability in its statement of financial
position. in 2006, as a result of the implementation of sfas no.158, the
company recognized an after-tax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive
income of $1.187 billion and $513 million for the u.s. and international
pension benefit plans, respectively, and $218 million for the postretirement
health care and life insurance benefit plan. see note 11 for additional detail.
reclassification adjustments are made to avoid double counting in
comprehensive income items that are also recorded as part of net income. in
2007, as disclosed in
the net periodic benefit cost table in note 11, $198 million pre-tax ($123
million after-tax) were reclassified to earnings from accumulated other
comprehensive income to pension and postretirement expense in the income
statement. these pension and postretirement expense amounts are shown in the
table in note 11 as amortization of transition (asset) obligation, amortization
of prior service cost (benefit) and amortization of net actuarial (gain) loss.
other reclassification adjustments (except
for cash flow hedging instruments adjustments provided in note 12) were not
material. no tax provision has been made for the translation of foreign
currency financial statements into u.s. dollars.

the company files income tax
returns in the u.s. federal jurisdiction, and various states and foreign
jurisdictions. with few exceptions, the company is no longer subject to u.s.
federal, state and local, or non-u.s. income tax examinations by tax
authorities for years before 1999. it is anticipated that its
examination for the companys u.s. income tax returns for the years 2002
through 2004 will be completed by the end of first quarter 2008. as of december31,
2007, the irs has proposed adjustments to the companys tax positions for which
the company is fully reserved. payments relating to any proposed assessments
arising from the 2002 through 2004 audit may not be made until a final
agreement is reached between the company and the irs on such assessments or
upon a final resolution resulting from the administrative appeals process or
judicial action. in addition to the u.s. federal examination, there is also
limited audit activity in several u.s. state and foreign jurisdictions.
currently, the company expects the liability for unrecognized tax benefits to
change by an insignificant amount during the next 12 months.
the company adopted the
provisions of fasb interpretation no.48, accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, on january1, 2007. as a result of the
implementation of interpretation 48, the company recognized an immaterial
increase in the liability for unrecognized tax benefits, which was accounted
for as a reduction to the january1, 2007, balance of retained earnings. a
reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of gross unrecognized tax
benefits (utb) is as follows:

$
the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits that, if recognized, would affect the effective tax
rate as of january1, 2007 and december31, 2007, respectively, are
$261 million and $334 million. the ending net utb results from adjusting the
gross balance at december31, 2007 for items such as federal, state, and
non-u.s. deferred items, interest and penalties, and deductible taxes. the net
utb is included as components of accrued income taxes and other liabilities
within the consolidated balance sheet.
the company recognizes
interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax benefits in tax
expense. at january1, 2007 and december31, 2007, accrued interest
and penalties on a gross basis were $65 million and $69 million, respectively.
included in these interest and penalty amounts is interest and penalties
related to tax positions for which the ultimate deductibility is highly certain
but for which there is uncertainty about the timing of such deductibility. because
of the impact of deferred tax accounting, other than interest and penalties,
the disallowance of the shorter deductibility period would not affect the
annual effective tax rate but would accelerate the payment of cash to the
taxing authority to an earlier period.
in 2007, the company
completed the preparation and filing of its 2006 u.s. federal and state income
tax returns, which did not result in any material changes to the companys
financial position. in 2006, an audit of the companys u.s. tax returns for
years through 2001 was completed. the company and the internal revenue service
reached a final settlement for these years, including an agreement on the
amount of a refund claim to be filed by the company. the company also
substantially resolved audits in certain european countries. in addition, the
company completed the preparation and filing of its 2005 u.s. federal income
tax return and the corresponding 2005 state income tax returns. the adjustments
from amounts previously estimated in the u.s. federal and state income tax
returns (both positive and negative) included lower u.s. taxes on dividends
received from the companys foreign subsidiaries. the company also made
quarterly adjustments (both positive and negative) to its reserves for tax
contingencies. considering the developments noted above and other factors,
including the impact on open audit years of the recent resolution of issues in
various audits, these reassessments resulted in a reduction of the reserves in
2006 by $149 million, inclusive of the expected amount of certain refund
claims.
in 2005, the
company announced its intent to reinvest $1.7 billion of foreign earnings in
the united states pursuant to the provisions of the american jobs creation act
of 2004. this act provided the company the opportunity to tax-
efficiently
repatriate foreign earnings for u.s. qualifying investments specified in its
domestic reinvestment plan. as a consequence, in 2005, 3m recorded a charge of
$75 million.
the company made discretionary contributions to its
u.s. qualified pension plan of $200 million in 2007, $200 million in 2006, and
$500million in 2005. the current income tax provision includes a benefit for the pension
contributions; the deferred tax provision includes a cost for the related
temporary difference.
as a result of certain employment commitments
and capital investments made by 3m, income from manufacturing activities in
certain countries is subject to reduced tax rates or, in some cases, is exempt
from tax for years through 2014. the income tax benefits attributable to the
tax status of these subsidiaries are estimated to be $47 million (6 cents per
diluted share) in 2007, $20 million (3cents per diluted share) in 2006,
and $23 million (3cents per diluted share) in 2005.
the company has
not provided deferred taxes on unremitted earnings attributable to
international companies that have been considered to be reinvested
indefinitely. these earnings relate to ongoing operations and were
approximately $5.7 billion as of december31, 2007. because of the
availability of u.s. foreign tax credits, it is not practicable to determine
the income tax liability that would be payable if such earnings were not
indefinitely reinvested.
note 9. marketable securities
the company invests in
asset-backed securities, agency securities, corporate medium-term note
securities, auction rate securities and other securities. the following is a

classification of
marketable securities as current or non-current is dependent upon managements
intended holding period, the securitys maturity date and liquidity
considerations based on market conditions. if management intends to hold the
securities for longer than one year as of the balance sheet date, they are
classified as non-current. the fair value of marketable securities approximates
cost, except for certain auction rate securities discussed in the next
paragraph. gross unrealized gains and losses for marketable securities were not
material as of december31, 2007 and 2006; however, in 2007 the company
did have both realized and unrealized losses associated with auction rate
securities as discussed below. gross realized gains and losses on sales of
marketable securities were not material for 2007, 2006 or 2005, but in 2007
pre-tax gains totaled approximately $7 million. cost of securities sold or
reclassified use the first in, first out (fifo) method. since these marketable
securities are classified as available-for-sale securities, changes in fair
value will flow through other comprehensive income, with amounts reclassified
out of other comprehensive income into earnings upon sale or other-than-temporary
impairment (as discussed below).
3m has a diversified
marketable securities portfolio of $1.059 billion as of december31, 2007.
within this portfolio, current and long-term asset-backed securities (estimated
fair value of $453 million) are primarily comprised of interests in automobile
loans and credit cards, with only $27 million invested in interests in
mortgage-backed securities or home equity loans. 3ms marketable securities
portfolio also includes auction rate securities (estimated fair value of $16
million) that represent interests in collateralized debt obligations, which are
collateralized by pools of residential and commercial mortgages, and interests
in investment grade credit default swaps. during the second half of 2007, these
auction rate securities failed to auction due to sell orders exceeding buy
orders. liquidity for these auction-rate securities is typically provided by an
auction process that resets the applicable interest rate at pre-determined
intervals,
usually every 7, 28, 35,
or 90 days. the funds associated with failed auctions will not be accessible
until a successful auction occurs or a buyer is found outside of the auction
process. based on broker-dealer valuation models and an analysis of
other-than-temporary impairment factors, auction rate securities with an
original par value of approximately $34 million were written-down to an
estimated fair value of $16 million as of december31, 2007. this
write-down resulted in an other-than-temporary impairment charge of
approximately $8 million (pre-tax) included in net income and a temporary
impairment charge of $10 million (pre-tax) reflected as an unrealized loss
within other comprehensive income for 2007. as of december31, 2007, these
investments in auction rate securities have been in a loss position for less
than six months. these auction rate securities are classified as non-current
marketable securities as of december31, 2007 as indicated in the
preceding table.
3m reviews impairments
associated with the above in accordance with emerging issues task force (eitf)
03-1 and fsp sfas 115-1 and 124-1, the meaning of
other-than-temporary-impairment and its application to certain investments, to determine the classification of the impairment as temporary
or other-than-temporary. a temporary impairment charge results in an
unrealized loss being recorded in the other comprehensive income component of
stockholders equity. such an unrealized loss does not reduce net income for
the applicable accounting period because the loss is not viewed as
other-than-temporary. the company believes that a portion of the impairment of
its auction rate securities investments is temporary and a portion is
other-than-temporary. the factors evaluated to differentiate between temporary
and other-than-temporary include the projected future cash flows, credit
ratings actions, and assessment of the credit quality of the underlying
collateral.
the balance at december31,
2007 for marketable securities and short-term investments by contractual
maturity are shown below. actual maturities may differ from contractual
maturities because the issuers of the securities may have the right to prepay
obligations without prepayment penalties.

long-term debt payments
due in 2008 include $350 million of dealer remarketable securities (final
maturity 2010) and $62 million of floating rate notes (final maturity 2044).
these securities are classified as current portion of long-term debt as the
result of put provisions associated with these debt instruments.
the
esop debt is serviced by dividends on stock held by the esop and by company
contributions. these contributions are not reported as interest expense, but
are reported as an employee benefit expense in the consolidated statement of
income. other borrowings includes debt held by 3ms international companies and
floating
rate
notes in the united states, with the long-term portion of this debt primarily
composed of u.s. dollar floating rate debt.
at december31, 2007, certain debt agreements
($350 million of dealer remarketable securities and $87million of esop
debt) had ratings triggers (bbb-/baa3 or lower) that would require repayment of
debt. the company has an aa credit rating from standard& poors, with
a stable outlook, and an aa1 credit rating from moodys investors service, with
a negative outlook. on april30, 2007, the company replaced its $565
million credit facility with a new $1.5 billion five-year credit facility,
which has provisions for the company to request an increase of the facility up
to $2 billion (at the lenders discretion), and providing for up to $150 million
in letters of credit. as of december31, 2007, there are $110 million in
letters of credit drawn against the facility. under the new credit agreement,
3m is required to maintain its ebitda to interest ratio as of the end of each
fiscal quarter at not less than 3.0 to 1. this is calculated (as defined in the
agreement) as the ratio of consolidated total ebitda for the four consecutive
quarters then ended to total interest expense on all funded debt for the same
period. at december31, 2007, this ratio was approximately 35 to 1. at december31,
2007, available short-term committed lines of credit internationally totaled
approximately $67 million, of which approximately $13 million was utilized.
debt covenants do not restrict the payment of dividends.
the company has a well-known seasoned issuer shelf
registration statement, effective february24, 2006, to register an
indeterminate amount of debt or equity securities for future sales. on june15,
2007, the company registered 150,718 shares of the companys common stock under
this shelf on behalf of and for the sole benefit of the selling stockholders in
connection with the companys acquisition of assets of diamond productions,inc.
the company intends to use the proceeds from future securities sales off this
shelf for general corporate purposes. in connection with this shelf
registration, in june2007 the company established a medium-term notes
program through which up to $3 billion of medium-term notes may be offered. in december2007,
3m issued a five-year, $500 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of
4.65% under this medium-term notes program. this program has a remaining
capacity of $2.5 billion as of december31, 2007.
in september2003, the company filed a shelf
registration statement with the securities and exchange commission relating to
the potential offering of debt securities of up to $1.5 billion. this shelf
registration became effective in october2003. in december2003, the
company established under the shelf a medium-term notes program through which
up to $1.5 billion of medium-term notes may be offered. in march2007, the
company issued a 30-year, $750 million, fixed rate note with a coupon rate of
5.70%. in november2006, 3m issued a three-year, $400 million, fixed rate
note. the company entered into an interest rate swap to convert this to a rate
based on a floating libor index. in december2004, 3m issued a 40-year,
$62 million, floating rate note, with the rate based on a floating libor index.
this $1.5 billion medium term notes program was replaced by the $3 billion
program established in june2007.
in july2007, 3m
issued a seven year 5.0% fixed rate eurobond for an amount of 750 million euros
(approximately $1.102 billion in u.s. dollars at december31, 2007). upon
debt issuance in july2007, 3m completed a fixed-to-floating interest rate
swap on a notional amount of 400 million euros as a fair value hedge of a
portion of the fixed interest rate eurobond obligation. in december2007,
3m reopened the existing seven year 5.0% fixed rate eurobond for an additional
amount of 275 million euros (approximately $404 million in u.s. dollars at december31,
2007). this security was issued at a premium and was subsequently consolidated
with the original security on january15, 2008.
3m
may redeem its 30-year zero-coupon senior notes (the convertible notes) at
any time in whole or in part, beginning november21, 2007, at the accreted
conversion price; however, bondholders may convert upon notification of
redemption each of the notes into 9.4602 shares of 3m common stock. holders of
the 30-year zero-coupon senior notes have the option to require 3m to purchase
their notes at accreted value on november21 in the years 2005, 2007,
2012, 2017, 2022 and 2027. in november2005, 22,506 of the 639,000 in
outstanding bonds were redeemed, resulting in a payout from 3m of approximately
$20 million. in november2007, an additional 364,598 outstanding bonds
were redeemed resulting in a payout from 3m of approximately $322 million.
these payouts reduced the convertible notes face value at maturity to $252
million, which equates to a book value of approximately $222 million at december31,
2007. as disclosed in a form8-k in november2005, 3m amended the
terms of these securities to pay cash at a rate of 2.40% per annum of the
principal amount at maturity of the companys convertible notes, which equates
to 2.75% per annum of the notes accreted value on november21, 2005. the
cash interest payments were made semiannually in arrears on may22, 2006, november22,
2006, may22, 2007 and november22, 2007 to holders of record on the
15th calendar day preceding each such interest payment date. effective november22,
2007, the effective interest rate reverted back to the original yield of 0.50%.
3m
originally sold $639 million in aggregate face amount of these convertible
notes on november15, 2002, which are convertible into shares of 3m
common stock. the gross proceeds from the offering, to be used for general
corporate purposes, were $550 million ($540 million net of issuance costs).
debt issuance costs were amortized on a straight-line basis over a three-year
period beginning in november2002. on february14, 2003, 3m
registered these convertible notes in a registration statement filed with the
securities and exchange commission. the terms of the
convertible
notes include a yield to maturity of .50% and an initial conversion premium of
40% over the $65.00 (split-adjusted) closing price of 3m common stock on november14,
2002. if certain conditions for conversion (relating to the closing common
stock prices of 3m exceeding the conversion trigger price for specified
periods) are met, holders may convert each of the 30-year zero-coupon senior
notes into 9.4602 shares of 3m common stock in any calendar quarter commencing
after march31, 2003. the conversion trigger price for the fourth quarter
of 2007 was $121.21 per share. if the conditions for conversion are met, and 3m
elects not to settle in cash, the 30-year zero-coupon senior notes will be
convertible in the aggregate into approximately 2.4 million shares of 3m common
stock. the conditions for conversion related to the companys convertible notes
have never been met. if the conditions for conversion are met, 3m may choose to
pay in cash and/or common stock; however, if this occurs, the company has the
intent and ability to settle this debt security in cash. accordingly, there was
no impact on 3ms diluted earnings per share.
in december2007, the companys $350 million of
dealer remarketable securities were remarketed for one year. they were reissued
with a fixed coupon rate of5.83%. these securities, which are classified
as current portion of long-term debt, were issued in december2000. the
remarketable securities can be remarketed annually, at the option of the
dealer, for a year each time, with a final maturity date of december2010.
in the second quarter of 2007, 3m repurchased $42 million in floating rate
notes due in 2037 at par as the bondholder exercised put provisions associated
with this debt instrument.
note
11. pension and postretirement benefit
plans
3m
has various company-sponsored retirement plans covering substantially all u.s.
employees and many employees outside the united states. pension benefits
associated with these plans generally are based on each participants years of
service, compensation, and age at retirement or termination. in addition to
providing pension benefits, the company provides certain postretirement health
care and life insurance benefits for substantially all of its u.s. employees
who reach retirement age while employed by the company. most international
employees and retirees are covered by government health care programs. the cost
of company-provided postretirement health care plans for international
employees is not material and is combined with u.s. amounts.
the
companys pension funding policy is to deposit with independent trustees
amounts allowable by law. trust funds and deposits with insurance companies are
maintained to provide pension benefits to plan participants and their
beneficiaries. there are no plan assets in the non-qualified plan due to its
nature. for its u.s. postretirement health care and life insurance benefit
plans, the company has set aside amounts at least equal to annual benefit
payments with an independent trustee.
in
august2006, the pension protection act (ppa) was signed into law in the
u.s. the ppa increases the funding target for defined benefit pension plans to
100% of the target liability. the ppa transition rulesrequire a funding
liability target of 92% in 2008, reaching 100% by 2011. 3ms u.s. qualified
defined benefit plans are funded in excess of the applicable transition funding
liability target for 2008; therefore, the company expects that the plans will
not be subject to the minimum required contribution of the ppa and its
transition ruleswill not have a material impact on expected future
contributions.
in september2006,
the fasb issued sfas no.158, employers accounting for defined benefit
pension and other postretirement plans, an amendment of fasb statements no.87,
88, 106 and 132(r). this standard requires employers to recognize the
underfunded or overfunded status of defined benefit pension and postretirement
plans as an asset or liability in its statement of financial position, and
recognize changes in the funded status in the year in which the changes occur
through accumulated other comprehensive income, which is a component of
stockholders equity. this standard also eliminates the requirement for
additional minimum pension liability (aml) required under sfas no.87. as
a result of the application of sfas no.158 as of december31, 2006,
3m reversed assets of $2.515billion and increased liabilities by $703
million. these liabilities were offset to accumulated other comprehensive
income and deferred taxes. in 2006, as a result of the implementation of sfas no.158,
the company recognized an after-tax decrease in accumulated other comprehensive
income of $1.187 billion and $513 million for the u.s. and international
pension benefit plans, respectively, and $218 million for the postretirement
health care and life insurance benefit plan.

as of december31, 2005,
the company converted to the rp (retirement plans) 2000 mortality table for
calculating the year-end 2005 u.s. pension and postretirement obligations and
2006 expense. the impact of this change increased the year-end 2005 u.s.
projected benefit obligations for pension by $385 million, the year-end 2005
u.s. accumulated benefit obligations for pension by $349 million and the 2005
u.s. accumulated postretirement benefit obligation by $93 million. this change
also increased pension expenses for 2006 by $64million and postretirement
expenses by $17 million.
the company reviews
external data and its own historical trends for health care costs to determine
the health care trend rates for the postretirement medical plans. as of december31,
2006, the company modified its health care trend rates assumption by raising
the rate and separating the trend rates used for plan participants less than 65
years of age and plan participants 65 years of age or older. the separation of
the trend rates reflects the higher costs associated with prescription drugs in
the 65 or older age group. the assumed health care trend rates as of december31
are as follows:

investment strategy for its pension and postretirement plans is to manage the
plans on a going-concern basis. the primary goal of the funds is to meet the
obligations as required. the secondary goal is to earn the highest rate of
return possible, without jeopardizing its primary goal, and without subjecting
the company to an undue amount of contribution rate volatility. fund returns
are used to help finance present and future obligations to the extent possible
within actuarially determined funding limits and tax-determined asset limits,
thus reducing the level of contributions 3m must make.
3m
does not buy or sell any of its own stock as a direct investment for its
pension and other postretirement benefit funds. however, due to external
investment management of the funds, the plans may indirectly buy, sell or hold
3m stock. the aggregate amount of the shares would not be considered to be
material relative to the aggregate fund percentages.
for the u.s. pension
plan, the companys assumption for the expected return on plan assets was 8.75%
in 2007. the company is lowering the 2008 expected return on plan assets for
its u.s. pension plan by 0.25 percentage points to 8.50%. this will reduce 2008
expected pension income by approximately $26 million. projected returns are
based primarily on broad, publicly traded equity and fixed-income indices and
forward-looking estimates of active portfolio and investment management. as of
december 31, 2007, the companys 2008 expected long-term rate of return on u.s.
plan assets is based on an asset allocation assumption of 46% global equities,
with an expected long-term rate of return of 7.75%, 13% private equities with
an expected long-term rate of return of 12.75%; 24% fixed-income securities
with an expected long-term rate of return of 5.0%; 12% absolute return
investments independent of traditional performance benchmarks, with an expected
long term return of 7%, 5% commodities with an expected long-term rate of
return of 6.5%. the company expects additional positive return from active
investment management. these assumptions result in an 8.50% expected rate of
return on an annualized basis. the plan assets earned a rate of return in
excess of 14%, 12% and 10% in 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively. the average
annual actual return on the plan assets over the past 10 and 25 years has been
9.1% and 12.2%, respectively.
during
2006, certain absolute return and commodity investments were included in equity
and fixed income allocations. the 2006 presentation in the table that follows
has been reclassified to conform to the 2007 presentation.

in
the third quarter of 2007, the company made discretionary contributions
totaling $200 million to its u.s. qualified pension plan. in 2008, the company
expects to contribute an amount in the range of $100 million to $400 million to
its u.s. and international pension plans. the company does not have a required
minimum pension contribution obligation for its u.s. plans in 2008. therefore,
the amount of the anticipated discretionary contribution could vary
significantly depending on the u.s. plans funding status as of the 2008
measurement date and the anticipated tax deductibility of the contribution.

note 12. derivatives and other
financial instruments
the company uses interest rate swaps, currency
swaps, and forward and option contracts to manage risks generally associated
with foreign exchange rate, interest rate and commodity price fluctuations. the
information that follows explains the various types of derivatives and
financial instruments, and includes a table that recaps cash flow hedging
amounts.
cash flow hedging  foreign currency forward and option contracts: the company enters
into foreign exchange forward contracts, options and swaps to hedge against the
effect of exchange rate fluctuations on cash flows denominated in foreign
currencies and certain intercompany financing transactions. these transactions
are designated as cash flow hedges. at december31, 2007, the company had
various open foreign exchange forward and option contracts, the majority of
which had maturities of one year or less. the settlement or extension of these
derivatives will result in reclassifications to earnings in the period during
which the hedged transactions affect earnings (from other comprehensive
income). the maximum length of time over which 3m is hedging its exposure to
the variability in future cash flows for a majority of the forecasted
transactions is 12 months. hedge ineffectiveness was not material for the years
2007, 2006 and 2005.
cash flow hedging  commodity
price management: the company manages commodity price risks through
negotiated supply contracts, price protection agreements and forward physical
contracts. the company uses commodity price swaps as cash flow hedges of
forecasted transactions to manage price volatility. the related mark-to-market
gain or loss on qualifying hedges is included in other comprehensive income to
the extent effective, and reclassified into cost of sales in the period during
which the hedged transaction affects earnings. 3m has hedged its exposure to
the variability of future cash flows for certain forecasted transactions
through 2008. no significant commodity cash flow hedges were discontinued and
hedge ineffectiveness was not material during the years 2007, 2006 and 2005.
cash flow hedging  forecasted
debt issuance: in june2007, the company executed a
pre-issuance cash flow hedge by entering into a floating-to-fixed interest rate
swap on a notional amount of 350 million euros related to the anticipated july2007
eurobond issuance of 750 million euros. upon debt issuance in july2007,
3m terminated the floating-to-fixed swap. the termination of the swap resulted
in an immaterial gain, which is being amortized over the seven year life of the
eurobond.
amounts recorded in accumulated other comprehensive
income (loss) related to cash flow hedging instruments follow.

at december31, 2007, the company expects to reclassify to earnings
over the next 12 months a majority of the cash flow hedging instruments
after-tax loss of $28 million (with the impact offset by cash flows
from underlying hedged items).
fair value hedging  interest rate swaps: the company manages
interest expense using a mix of fixed and floating rate debt. to help manage
borrowing costs, the company may enter into interest rate swaps. under these
arrangements, the company agrees to exchange, at specified intervals, the difference
between fixed and floating interest amounts calculated by reference to an
agreed-upon notional principal amount.
at december31,
2007, the company had interest rate swaps designated as fair value hedges of
underlying fixed rate obligations. in june2006, the company entered into
a $330 million fixed-to-floating interest rate swap to hedge the 30-year bond
due in 2028. the company terminated the swap in march2007 and the
resulting gain will be recognized over the remaining life of the underlying
debt. accordingly, the termination of the swap did not have a material impact
on 3ms consolidated results of operations or financial condition. as indicated
in note 10, in november2006, the company entered into a $400 million
fixed-to-floating interest rate swap concurrent with the issuance of the
three-year medium-term note due in 2009. also as indicated in note 10, in july2007, in
connection with the issuance of a seven-year eurobond for an amount of 750
million euros, the company completed a fixed-to-floating interest rate swap on
a notional amount of 400 million euros as a fair value hedge of a portion of
the fixed interest rate eurobond obligation. the
mark-to-market of these fair value hedges is recorded as gains or losses in
interest expense and is offset by the gain or loss on the underlying debt
instrument, which also is recorded in interest expense. the fair value of these
interest rate swaps were $36 million and $26 million as of december31,
2007 and 2006, respectively. these fair value hedges are 100% effective and,
thus, there is no impact on earnings due to hedge ineffectiveness.
net
investment hedging: as circumstances warrant, the company uses cross
currency swaps, forwards and foreign currency denominated debt to hedge
portions of the companys net investments in foreign operations. for hedges
that meet the effectiveness requirements, the net gains or losses attributable
to changes in spot exchange rates are recorded in cumulative translation within
other comprehensive income. the remainder of the change in value of such
instruments is recorded in earnings.
in september2006, the company entered into a three-year
floating-to-floating cross currency swap with a notional amount of $300
million. this transaction is a partial hedge of the companys net investment in
its japanese subsidiaries. this swap converts u.s. dollar-based variable
interest payments to yen-based variable interest payments associated with the
notional amount.
in november2006,
the company entered into a three-year floating-to-floating
cross currency swap with a notional amount of $200 million. this
transaction is a partial hedge of the companys net investment in its european
subsidiaries. this swap converts u.s.
dollar-based variable interest payments to euro-based variable interest payments associated with the notional amount.
in december2006,
the company entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a notional
amount of $556million relative to the companys net investment in its
european subsidiaries and with a notional amount of $209million relative
to the companys net investment in its japanese subsidiaries. these forwards
matured in december2007.
in julyand december2007,
as discussed in note 10, the company issued seven-year fixed rate eurobond
securities for amounts of 750 million euros and 275 million euros,
respectively. 3m designated each of these eurobond issuances as hedging
instruments of the companys net investment in its european subsidiaries.
in novemberand december2007,
the company entered into foreign currency forward contracts with a notional
amount of $200 million that were
designated as a partial hedge of the companys net investment in its
chinese subsidiaries. these forwards mature in december2008.
the
unrealized loss recorded in cumulative translation related to net investment
hedging at december31, 2007 was $28million
and the unrealized loss at december31, 2006 was $18 million.
currency effects: 3m estimates that year-on-year currency effects,
including hedging impacts, increased net income by approximately $150 million
in 2007, $20 million in 2006, and $115 million in 2005. this estimate includes
the effect of translating profits from local currencies into u.s. dollars; the
impact of currency fluctuations on the transfer of goods between 3m operations
in the united states and abroad; and transaction gains and losses, including
derivative instruments designed to reduce foreign currency exchange rate risks.
3m estimates that year-on-year derivative and other transaction gains and losses
increased net income by approximately $10 million in 2007, had an immaterial
impact on net income in 2006, and increased net income by approximately $50
million in 2005.
credit risk: the company is exposed
to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by counterparties in interest
rate swaps, currency swaps, and option and foreign exchange contracts. however,
the companys risk is limited to the fair value of the instruments. the company
actively monitors its exposure to credit risk through the use of credit
approvals and credit limits, and by selecting major international banks and
financial institutions as counterparties. the company does not anticipate
nonperformance by any of these counterparties. during the second quarter of 2006, the company
entered into a credit support agreement with one of its primary derivatives
counterparties. under this agreement either party is required to post eligible
collateral when the market value of transactions covered by the agreement
exceeds specified thresholds, thus limiting credit exposure for both parties.
fair value of financial instruments: at december31,
2007 and 2006, the companys financial instruments included cash and cash
equivalents, marketable securities, accounts receivable, investments, accounts
payable, borrowings, and derivative contracts. the fair values of cash and cash
equivalents, accounts receivable, accounts payable, and short-term borrowings
and current portion of long-term debt (except the $350 million dealer
remarketable security) approximated carrying values because of the short-term
nature of these instruments. available-for-sale marketable securities,
investments and derivative contracts are reported at fair values. fair values
for investments held at cost are not readily available, but are estimated to
approximate fair value. the carrying amounts and estimated fair values of other
financial instruments based on third-party quotes as of december31

capital
and operating leases:
rental expense under
operating leases was $226 million in 2007, $211 million in 2006, and $195
million in 2005. it is 3ms practice to secure renewal rights for leases,
thereby giving 3m the right, but not the obligation, to maintain a presence in
a leased facility. 3ms primary capital lease, which became effective in april2003,
involves a building in the united kingdom (with a lease term of 22 years).
during the second quarter of 2003, 3m recorded a capital lease asset and
obligation of approximately 33.5 million united kingdom pounds (approximately
$67 million at december31, 2007 exchange rates). minimum lease payments
under capital and operating leases with non-cancelable terms in excess of one

warranties/guarantees:
3ms accrued product warranty liabilities, recorded on
the consolidated balance sheet as part of current and long-term liabilities,
are estimated at approximately $21 million as of december31, 2007. 3m
does not consider this amount to be material.
the fair value of 3m guarantees of loans with third parties and other
guarantee arrangements are not material.
related party activity:
purchases
from related parties (largely related to companies in which 3m has an equity
interest) totaled approximately $144 million in 2007 ($160 million in 2006 and
$141 million in 2005). receivables due from related parties (largely related to
receivables from employees for relocation and other ordinary business expense
advances) totaled approximately $40million in 2007 ($36 million in 2006,
and $37 million in 2005). 3m sales to related parties totaled approximately $6
million in 2007 ($4 million in 2006, and $5 million in 2005). indebtedness to
3m from related parties was not material in 2007, 2006 and 2005.
legal proceedings:
the company and some of its subsidiaries are involved in numerous claims
and lawsuits, principally in the united states, and regulatory proceedings
worldwide. these include various products liability (involving products that
the company now or formerly manufactured and sold), intellectual property, and
commercial claims and lawsuits, including those brought under the antitrust
laws, and environmental proceedings. the following sections first describe the
significant legal proceedings in which the company is involved, and then
describe the liabilities and associated insurance receivables the company has accrued
relating to its significant legal proceedings. unless otherwise stated, the
company is vigorously defending all such litigation.
shareholder derivative litigation
as previously reported, in july2007, a shareholder derivative
lawsuit was filed in the u.s. district court for the district of delaware
against the company as nominal defendant and against each then current member
of the board of directors and the officers named in the summary compensation
table of the 2007 proxy statement. the suit alleges that the companys 2007
proxy statement contained false and misleading statements concerning the tax
deductibility of compensation payable under the executive annual incentive plan
(plan) and the standards for determining the amounts payable under the plan.
the lawsuit seeks a declaration voiding shareholder approval of the plan,
termination of the plan, voiding the elections of directors, equitable
accounting, and awarding costs, including attorneys fees. plaintiff filed a motion for summary
judgment, and the defendants filed a motion to dismiss all claims on the
grounds that plaintiff had failed to make a demand on the board and had
otherwise failed to state a proper claim under the private securities
litigation reform act. the defendants also moved to transfer the case from the
district of delaware to the district of minnesota. in february 2008, the court
denied without prejudice the plaintiffs motion for summary judgment.
breast implant litigation
the company and certain other companies were named as defendants in past
years in numerous claims and lawsuits alleging damages for personal injuries of
various types resulting from breast implants formerly manufactured by the
company or a related company. the vast majority of claims against the company have
been resolved. the company does not consider its remaining probable liability
to be material. information concerning the associated insurance receivable and
legal proceedings related to it follows in the paragraph entitled breast implant insurance receivables.
respirator mask/asbestos
litigation
for more than 25 years the company has defended and resolved the claims
of hundreds of thousands of individual claimants alleging injuries from
occupational dust exposures. as of december31, 2007, the company is a
named defendant, with multiple co-defendants, in numerous lawsuits in various
courts that purport to represent approximately 8,750 individual claimants, a
decrease from the approximately 17,700 individual claimants with actions
pending at december31, 2006.
the vast majority of the lawsuits and claims resolved by and currently
pending against the company allege use of some of the companys mask and
respirator products and seek damages from the company and other defendants for
alleged personal injury from workplace exposures to asbestos, silica, coal or
other occupational dusts found in products manufactured by other defendants or
generally in the workplace. a minority of claimants generally allege personal
injury from occupational exposure to asbestos from products previously
manufactured by the company, which are often unspecified, as well as products
manufactured by other defendants, or occasionally at company premises.
in many of these lawsuits and claims, the company is named as a
defendant with multiple co-defendants where no product the company manufactured
is identified or where the company is ultimately determined not to have
manufactured the products identified by the plaintiffs. the companys vigorous
defense of this litigation has resulted in dismissals of many claims without
any payment by the company, and jury verdicts for the company in seven of the
eight cases tried to verdict (such trials occurred in 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004
and 2007), and an appellate reversal in 2005 of the one jury verdict adverse to
the company.
as previously reported, the company won a defense verdict in july2007
from a jury in the federal court in eastern district of missouri. the jury found the company had no liability
whatever to a plaintiff who claimed he had silicosis and a related cancer and
sought to recover damages from the company arising from his alleged illness,
which he claimed to have contracted from occupational exposure to silica
despite his purported use of the companys respirator mask equipment at various
times. the jury rejected each of the plaintiffs theories of liability against
the company.
many of the resolved lawsuits and claims involved unimpaired claimants
who were recruited by plaintiffs lawyers through mass chest x-ray screenings.
the company experienced a significant decline in the number of claims filed in
2007 from prior years by apparently unimpaired claimants. the company
attributes this decline to several factors, including certain changes enacted
in several states in recent years of the law governing asbestos-related claims,
and the highly-publicized decision in mid-2005 of the united states district
court for the southern district of texas that identified and criticized abuses
by certain attorneys, doctors and x-ray screening companies on behalf of
claimants. the company expects the filing of claims by unimpaired claimants in
the future to continue at much lower levels than in the past. the company
believes that due to this change in the type and volume of incoming claims, it
is likely that the number of claims alleging more serious injuries, including
mesothelioma and other malignancies, while remaining relatively constant, will
represent a greater percentage of total claims than in the past. the company
has demonstrated in past trial proceedings that its respiratory protection
products are effective as claimed when used in the intended manner and in the
intended circumstances. consequently the company believes that claimants are
unable to establish that their medical conditions, even if significant, are
attributable to the companys respiratory protection products. nonetheless the
companys litigation experience indicates that such claims are costlier to
resolve than the claims of unimpaired persons, and it therefore anticipates an
increase in the average cost of resolving pending and future claims on a
per-claim basis than it experienced in prior periods when the vast majority of
claims were asserted by the unimpaired.
plaintiffs have asserted specific dollar claims for damages in
approximately 66% of the 3,979 lawsuits that were pending against the company
at the end of 2007 in all jurisdictions. a majority of states restrict or
prohibit specifying damages in tort cases such as these, and most of the
remaining jurisdictions do not require such specification. in those cases in
which plaintiffs choose to assert specific dollar amounts in their complaints,
brought in states that permit such pleading, the amounts claimed are typically
not meaningful as an indicator of the companys potential liability. this is
because (a)the amounts claimed typically bear no relation to the extent
of the plaintiffs injury, if any; (b)the complaints nearly always assert
claims against multiple defendants with the typical complaint asserting claims
against as few as a dozen different defendants to upwards of 275 different
defendants, the damages alleged are not attributed to individual defendants,
and a defendants share of liability may turn on the law of joint and several
liability, which can vary by state, and by the amount of fault a jury allocates
to each defendant if a case is ultimately tried before a jury; (c)many
cases are filed against the company even though the plaintiffs did not use any
of the companys products and, ultimately, are withdrawn or dismissed without
any payment; and (d)many cases are brought on behalf of plaintiffs who
have not suffered any medical injury, and, ultimately, are resolved without any
payment or a payment that is a small fraction of the damages initially claimed.
of the 2,629 pending cases in which purported damage amounts are specified in
the complaints, 860 cases involve claims of $100,000 or less, (one (1)of
them also alleges punitive damages of $15,000, nine (9)of them also
allege punitive damages of $30,000, and three (3)of them also allege
punitive damages of $1,000,000); 186 cases involve claims between $100,000 and
$3 million (thirty-three (33) of them also allege punitive damages of $250,000,
one (1)of them also alleges punitive damages of $1 million, forty-three
(43) of them also allege punitive damages of $1.5 million, and 106 of them also
allege punitive damages of $2 million); two (2)cases involve claims of $3
million to $7.5 million (one (1)also alleges punitive damages of $350,000
and one (1)of them also alleges punitive damages of $5 million); 21 cases involve
claims of $7.5 million; four (4)cases involve claims of $7.5 million to
$10 million (four (4)of them also allege damages of $21 million); 1,540
cases involve claims of $10 million (two (2)of them also allege punitive
damages of $350,000, 1,531 of them also allege punitive damages of $10 million,
and one (1)of them also alleges punitive damages of $15 million); 13
cases involve claims of $10 million to $50 million (one (1)of them also
allege punitive damages of $15 million, five (5)of them also allege
punitive damages of $15.5 million, and three (3)of them also allege
punitive damages of $20 million); and three (3)cases involve claims of
$50 million (two (2)of them also alleges punitive damages of $50
million). some complaints allege that the compensatory and punitive damages are
at least the amounts specified. as stated, the companys experience and the
other reasons cited indicate that the damage amounts specified in complaints
are not a meaningful factor in any assessment of the companys potential
liability.
as previously reported, the state of west virginia, through its attorney
general, filed a complaint in 2003 against the company and two other
manufacturers of respiratory protection products in the circuit court of
lincoln county, west virginia and amended it in 2005. the amended complaint
seeks substantial, but unspecified, compensatory damages primarily for
reimbursement of the costs allegedly incurred by the state for workers
compensation and healthcare benefits provided to all workers with occupational pneumoconiosis and unspecified punitive damages.
employment litigation
as previously reported, one current and one former employee of the
company filed a purported class action in the district court of ramsey county,
minnesota, in december2004, seeking to represent a class of all current
and certain former salaried employees employed by 3m in minnesota below a
certain salary grade who were age 46 or older at any time during the applicable
period to be determined by the court. the complaint alleges the plaintiffs
suffered various forms of employment discrimination on the basis of age in
violation of the minnesota human rights act and seeks injunctive relief,
unspecified compensatory damages (which they seek to treble under the statute),
including back and front pay, punitive damages (limited by statute to $8,500
per claimant) and attorneys fees. in january2006, the plaintiffs filed a
motion to join four additional named plaintiffs. this motion was unopposed by
the company and the four plaintiffs were joined in the
case, although one claim has been dismissed following an individual
settlement. the class certification hearing was held in december2007. the
company expects a ruling on the class certification in the first half of 2008.
a similar age discrimination purported class action was filed against
the company in november2005 in the superior court of essex county, new
jersey, on behalf of a class of new jersey-based employees of the company. the
company removed this case to the united states district court for the district
of new jersey. on june29, 2007, the attorneys for the plaintiff amended
their complaint and dropped the class action allegations.
in addition, three former employees filed age discrimination charges
against the company with the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission and
the pertinent state agencies in minnesota and california during 2005; two of
these charges were amended in 2006. such filings include allegations that the
release of claims signed by certain former employees in the purported class
defined in the charges is invalid for various reasons and assert age
discrimination claims on behalf of certain current and former salaried
employees in states other than minnesota and new jersey. in 2006, one current
employee filed an age discrimination charge against the company with the u.s.
equal employment opportunity commission and the pertinent state agency in
missouri, asserting claims on behalf of a class of all current and certain
former salaried employees who worked in missouri and other states other than
minnesota and new jersey. the same law firm represents the plaintiffs and
claimants in each of these proceedings.
environmental matters and
litigation
the companys operations are subject to environmental laws and
regulations including those pertaining to air emissions, wastewater discharges,
toxic substances, and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes
enforceable by national, state, and local authorities around the world, and
private parties in the united states and abroad. these laws and regulations
provide, under certain circumstances, a basis for the remediation of
contamination and for personal injury and property damage claims. the company
has incurred, and will continue to incur, costs and capital expenditures in
complying with these laws and regulations, defending personal injury and
property damage claims, and modifying its business operations in light of its
environmental responsibilities. in its effort to satisfy its environmental
responsibilities and comply with environmental laws and regulations, the
company has established, and periodically updates, policies relating to
environmental standards of performance for its operations worldwide.
remediation: under certain environmental
laws, including the united states comprehensive environmental response, compensation
and liability act of 1980 and similar state laws, the company may be jointly
and severally liable, typically with other companies, for the costs of
environmental contamination at current or former facilities and at off-site
locations. the company has identified numerous locations, most of which are in
the united states, at which it may have some liability. please refer to the following section, accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal
proceedings for more information on this subject.
regulatory activities: as previously reported, the
company has been voluntarily cooperating with ongoing reviews by local, state,
national (primarily the u.s. environmental protection agency (epa)), and
international agencies of possible environmental and health effects of
perfluorooctanyl compounds (perflurooctanoic acid or pfoa and perfluorooctane
sulfonate or pfos) and related compounds. as a result of its phase-out
decision in may2000, the company no longer manufactures perfluorooctanyl
compounds, except that a subsidiary recovers and recycles pfoa in gendorf,
germany, for internal use in production processes and has agreed to a product
stewardship initiative with the epa to work toward elimination of its use of
pfoa by 2015.
regulatory
activities concerning pfoa and/or pfos continue in europe and elsewhere, and
before certain international bodies. these activities include gathering of
exposure and use information, risk assessment, and consideration of regulatory
approaches.
as previously reported, the company, in cooperation with state agencies,
tested soil and groundwater beneath three former waste disposal sites in
washington county, minnesota, used many years ago by the company to dispose
lawfully of waste containing perfluorinated compounds. in addition, subsequent
testing of water from certain municipal wells in oakdale, minnesota and some
private wells in lake elmo, minnesota, indicated the presence of low levels of
pfos and pfoa that, in some cases, were slightly above guidelines established
by the minnesota department of health (mdh).
as previously reported, the company addressed the presence of these
compounds in the water by treating certain municipal wells in oakdale and by
providing a grant to the city of lake elmo to extend city water to certain
residents with these compounds in their private wells. in march2007 the
mdh lowered the health-based values (hbvs) (i.e., the amount of a chemical in
drinking water considered by the mdh staff to be safe for people to drink for a
lifetime) for pfoa from 7 parts per billion (ppb) to 0.5 ppb and for pfos from
1 ppb to 0.3 ppb. in august2007 the mdh established these same levels as
health risk limits (hrl) (i.e., the amount of a chemical in drinking water
determined by the mdh to be safe for people to drink for a lifetime) through an
expedited rule-making process. in a final report issued on january15,
2008, the mdh proposed a draft value to lower the hrl for pfoa from 0.5 ppb to
0.3 ppb in anticipation of hrl rule-making in 2008.
as previously reported, the mdh has also detected low levels of a
perfluorinated compound called perfluorobutanoic acid (pfba) in municipal wells
(and in private wells as announced by the mdh in june2007) in six nearby
communities (woodbury, cottage grove, newport, st. paul park, south st. paul,
and hastings, all communities located southeast of
st. paul), some of which slightly exceed the mdhs well guidance for
pfba, currently at 1 ppb. the company is working with the mdh and the minnesota
pollution control agency (mpca) in assessing the source of pfba in these wells
and is supplying data that could be used in determining an appropriate drinking
water guideline level. the mdh has not issued an hbv for pfba, but the company
expects the mdh to issue further guidance in the first quarter of 2008. the
company has advised the affected communities that it will assist them in
assuring their drinking water falls below the hbv for pfba when such value is
finally determined.
on may22, 2007, the mpca citizens board approved the settlement
agreement and consent order to address the presence of perfluorinated compounds
in the soil and groundwater at former disposal sites in washington county
minnesota and at the companys manufacturing facility at cottage grove
minnesota. under this agreement, the company agreed to (i)evaluate
releases of perfluorinated compounds from these sites and propose response
actions; (ii)provide alternative drinking water if and when an hbv or hrl
is exceeded for any perfluorinated compounds as a result of contamination from
these sites; (iii)share information with the mpca about perfluorinated
compounds; (iv)reimburse the mpca future costs of research that are
connected to releases from the companys operations in minnesota (the company
agreed to reimburse the mpca for past research costs and provided a grant up to
$5 million over the next four years for the purpose of investigating and
assessing the presence and effects of perflouronated compounds in the
environment and biota); and (v)pay the mpca up to $8 million towards the
implementation of remedial actions at the washington county landfill. the company is working with the mpca under
the terms of the settlement agreement and consent order to propose alternatives
that the mpca will consider to address the presence of perfluorinated compounds
in the soil and groundwater at these sites.
the company cannot predict what regulatory actions arising from the
foregoing proceedings and activities, if any, may be taken regarding such
compounds or the consequences of any such actions.
in february 2008,
the epa notified the company that it is seeking $173,000 in penalties due to
alleged past violations of certain monitoring and record keeping requirements under
federal air pollution regulations at the companys manufacturing facility in
cottage grove, minnesota. the company had been operating under a monitoring and
record keeping approach that had been approved by the mpca. the epa has now
approved the companys alternative monitoring and record keeping approach.
litigation: as previously reported, a
former employee filed a purported class action lawsuit in 2002 in the circuit
court of morgan county, alabama, involving perfluorooctanyl chemistry, alleging
that the plaintiffs suffered fear, increased risk, subclinical injuries, and
property damage from exposure to perfluorooctanyl chemistry at or near the
companys decatur, alabama, manufacturing facility. the circuit court in 2005 granted the companys motion
to dismiss the named plaintiffs personal injury-related claims on the basis
that such claims are barred by the exclusivity provisions of the states
workers compensation act. the plaintiffs counsel filed an amended complaint in
november2006, limiting the case to property damage claims on behalf of a
purported class of residents and property owners in the vicinity of the decatur
plant. also in 2005, the judge in a second
purported class action lawsuit (filed by three residents of morgan county,
alabama, seeking unstated compensatory and punitive damages involving alleged
damage to their property from emissions of perfluorooctanyl compounds from the
companys decatur, alabama, manufacturing facility that formerly manufactured
those compounds) granted the companys motion to abate the case, effectively
putting the case on hold pending the resolution of class certification issues
in the action described above filed in the same court in 2002. despite the
stay, plaintiffs filed an amended complaint seeking damages for alleged
personal injuries and property damage on behalf of the named plaintiffs and the
members of a purported class. no further action in the case is expected unless
and until the stay is lifted.
as previously reported, two residents of washington county, minnesota,
filed in october2004 a purported class action in the district court of
washington county on behalf of washington county residents who have allegedly
suffered personal injuries and property damage from alleged emissions from the former perfluorooctanyl
production facility at cottage grove, minnesota, and from historic waste
disposal sites in the vicinity of that facility. after the district court granted the companys motion to
dismiss the claims for medical monitoring and public nuisance in april2005,
the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint adding additional allegations
involving other perfluorinated compounds manufactured by the company, alleging
additional legal theories in support of their claims, adding four plaintiffs,
and seeking relief based on alleged contamination of the city of oakdale
municipal water supply and certain private wells in the vicinity of lake elmo,
minnesota. in april2006, the plaintiffs filed a second amended complaint
adding two additional plaintiffs. the two original plaintiffs thereafter
dismissed their claims against the company. after a hearing on the plaintiffs
motion to certify the case as a class action at the end of march2007, the
court on june19, 2007 denied the plaintiffs motion to certify the
litigation as a class action. the trial of the individual cases is scheduled
for january2009.
several hundred plaintiffs who claim to have lived in the vicinity of
the acme barrel companys storage drum reconditioning facility in chicago,
illinois, filed a lawsuit in the third quarter of 2003 in the circuit court of
cook county, illinois, against 3m and a number of other companies that
allegedly were customers of acme barrel. since the court rejected plaintiffs
attempt to have this litigation proceed as a class action, 71 individuals have
asserted claims against the company and several other defendants for damages
allegedly caused by emissions of hazardous materials from the acme barrel drum
reconditioning facility.
in the second quarter of 2006, the new jersey department of
environmental protection served a lawsuit that was filed in new jersey state
court against the company and several other companies seeking cleanup and
removal costs and damages to natural resources allegedly caused by the
discharge of hazardous substances from two former waste disposal sites in new
jersey. during the fourth quarter, the company negotiated a settlement of new
jerseys claims. under the terms of the
settlement, the company will transfer to the state of new jersey 150 acres of
undeveloped land with groundwater recharge potential, which the company
acquired for purposes of the settlement, and will pay the states attorneys
fees. notice of the settlement was published for public comment in december2007,
and no objections were received. as a result, the company and the state of new
jersey have signed the formal settlement agreement pursuant to which the
company will transfer title to the property and will be dismissed from the
lawsuit, which will continue against the codefendants.
accrued liabilities and insurance receivables related to legal
proceedings
the company complies with the requirements of statement of financial
accounting standards no.5, accounting for contingencies, and related
guidance, and records liabilities for legal proceedings in those instances
where it can reasonably estimate the amount of the loss and where liability is
probable. where the reasonable estimate of the probable loss is a range, the company
records the most likely estimate of the loss, or the low end of the range if
there is no one best estimate. the company either discloses the amount of a
possible loss or range of loss in excess of established reserves if estimable,
or states that such an estimate cannot be made. for those insured matters where
the company has taken a reserve, the company also records receivables for the
amount of insurance that it expects to recover under the companys insurance
program. for those insured matters where the company has not taken a reserve
because the liability is not probable or the amount of the liability is not
estimable, or both, but where the company has incurred an expense in defending
itself, the company records receivables for the amount of insurance that it
expects to recover for the expense incurred. the company discloses significant
legal proceedings even where liability is not probable or the amount of the
liability is not estimable, or both, if the company believes there is at least
a reasonable possibility that a loss may be incurred.
because litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties, and unfavorable
rulings or developments could occur, there can be no certainty that the company
may not ultimately incur charges in excess of presently recorded liabilities. a
future adverse ruling, settlement, or unfavorable development could result in
future charges that could have a material adverse effect on the companys
results of operations or cash flows in the period in which they are recorded.
the company currently believes that such future charges, if any, would not have
a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position of the
company, taking into account its significant available insurance coverage.
based on experience and developments, the company periodically reexamines its
estimates of probable liabilities and associated expenses and receivables, and
whether it is able to estimate a liability previously determined to be not
estimable and/or not probable. where appropriate, the company makes additions
to or adjustments of its estimated liabilities. as a result, the current
estimates of the potential impact on the companys consolidated financial
position, results of operations and cash flows for the legal proceedings and
claims pending against the company could change in the future.
the company estimates insurance receivables based on an analysis of its
numerous policies, including their exclusions, pertinent case law interpreting
comparable policies, its experience with similar claims, and assessment of the
nature of the claim, and records an amount it has concluded is likely to be
recovered.
the following table shows the major categories of on-going litigation,
environmental remediation and other environmental liabilities for which the
company has been able to estimate its probable liability and for which the
company has taken reserves and the related insurance receivables:
at december31
(millions)
breast implant liabilities

breast implant receivables
respirator mask/asbestos liabilities
respirator mask/asbestos receivables
environmental remediation liabilities
environmental remediation receivables
other environmental liabilities
for those
significant pending legal proceedings that do not appear in the table and that
are not the subject of pending settlement agreements, the company has
determined that liability is not probable or
the amount of the liability is not estimable, or both, and the company is
unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss at this time. the amounts
in the preceding table with respect to breast implant and environmental
remediation represent the companys best estimate of the respective
liabilities. the company does not believe that there is any single best
estimate of the respirator/mask/asbestos liability or the other environmental
liabilities shown above, nor that it can reliably estimate the amount or range
of amounts by which those liabilities may exceed the reserves the company has
established.
breast implant insurance receivables: in the breast implant insurance coverage
litigation, the district court in ramsey county minnesota entered an order in september2007
dismissing from the suit the last of the insurers that were still contesting
the extent of their coverage for the companys breast implant product liability
claims. the dismissal was pursuant to a settlement the company reached with
those insurers during the third quarter of 2007. as of december31, 2007,
the company had receivables for insurance recoveries related to the breast
implant matter of $64 million. the company received $29 million in 2007,
reducing this receivable by that amount. the company also received $48 million
in january2008 and expects to receive an additional $10 million by the
end of 2008 pursuant to a settlement agreement with three insurers. the company
continues to pursue recovery against its remaining insurers and expects to
collect the remaining receivable.
respirator
mask/asbestos liabilities and insurance receivables: the company estimates its respirator
mask/asbestos liabilities, including the cost to resolve the claim and defense
costs, by examining: (i)the companys experience in resolving claims, (ii)apparent
trends, (iii)the apparent quality of claims (e.g.,
whether the claim has been asserted on
behalf of asymptomatic claimants), (iv)changes in the nature and
mix of claims (e.g., the proportion of claims
asserting usage of the companys mask or respirator products and alleging
exposure to each of asbestos, silica, coal or other occupational dusts, and
claims pleading use of asbestos-containing products allegedly manufactured by
the company), (v)the number of current claims and a projection of the
number of future asbestos and other claims that may be filed against the
company, (vi)the cost to resolve recently settled claims, and (vii)an
estimate of the cost to resolve and defend against current and future claims.
because of the inherent difficulty in projecting the number of claims that have
not yet been asserted, particularly with respect to the companys respiratory
products that themselves did not contain any harmful materials (which makes the
various published studies that purport to project future asbestos claims
substantially removed from the companys principal experience and which
themselves vary widely), the company does not believe that there is any single
best estimate of this liability, nor that it can reliably estimate the amount
or range of amounts by which the liability may exceed the reserve the company
has established. no liability has been
recorded regarding the pending action brought by the west virginia
attorney general previously described.
developments
may occur that could affect the companys estimate of its liabilities. these
developments include, but are not limited to, significant changes in (i)the
number of future claims, (ii)the average cost of resolving claims, (iii)the
legal costs of defending these claims and in maintaining trial readiness, (iv)changes
in the mix and nature of claims received, (v)trial and appellate
outcomes, (vi)changes in the law and procedure applicable to these
claims, and (vii)the financial viability of other co-defendants and
insurers.
as of december31, 2007, the companys receivable for insurance
recoveries related to the respirator mask/asbestos litigation was $332 million.
various factors could affect the timing and amount of recovery of this
receivable, including (i)delays in or avoidance of payment by insurers; (ii)the
extent to which insurers may become insolvent in the future, and (iii)the
outcome of negotiations with insurers and legal proceedings with respect to
respirator mask/asbestos liability insurance coverage. the difference between
the accrued liability and insurance receivable represents in part the time
delay between payment of claims on the one hand and receipt of insurance
reimbursements on the other hand. because of the lag time between settlement
and payment of a claim, no meaningful conclusions may be drawn from quarterly
changes in the amount of receivables for expected insurance recoveries and the
quarterly changes in the number of claimants at the end of each quarter.
on january5, 2007 the company was served with a declaratory
judgment action filed on behalf of two of its insurers (continental casualty
and continental insurance co.) disclaiming coverage for respirator/mask claims.
the action was filed in hennepin county, minnesota and names, in addition to
the company, over 60 of the companys insurers. this action is similar in
nature to an action filed in 1994 with respect to breast implant coverage,
which ultimately resulted in the minnesota supreme courts ruling of 2003 that
was largely in the companys favor. at the companys request, the case was
transferred to ramsey county, over the objections of the insurers. the
minnesota supreme court agreed to hear the insurers appeal of that decision.
oral argument on the appeal is scheduled for march2008.
environmental and other liabilities and insurance
receivables: as of december31, 2007, the company had recorded
liabilities of $37 million for estimated environmental remediation costs based
upon an evaluation of currently available facts with respect to each individual
site and also recorded related insurance receivables of $15 million. the
company records liabilities for remediation costs on an undiscounted basis when
they are probable and reasonably estimable, generally no later than the
completion of feasibility studies or the companys commitment to a plan of
action. liabilities for estimated costs of environmental remediation, depending
on the site, are based primarily upon internal or third-party environmental
studies, and estimates as to the number, participation level and financial
viability of any other potentially responsible parties, the extent of the
contamination and the nature of required remedial actions. the company adjusts
recorded liabilities as further information develops or circumstances change.
the company expects that it will pay the amounts recorded over the periods of
remediation for the applicable sites, currently ranging up to 30 years.
as of december31, 2007, the company had recorded liabilities of
$147 million for estimated other environmental liabilities based upon an
evaluation of currently available facts. as previously reported, the company increased its
other environmental liabilities by $121 million in the first quarter of 2007 as
a result of regulatory developments in minnesota and the completion of a
comprehensive review with environmental consultants regarding its other environmental
liabilities which include the estimated
costs of addressing trace amounts of perfluorinated compounds in drinking water
sources in the city of oakdale and lake elmo, minnesota, as well as presence in
the soil and groundwater at the companys manufacturing facilities in decatur,
alabama, and cottage grove, minnesota, and at two former disposal sites in
minnesota. the company expects that most of the spending will occur over
the next three to seven years. while the
company is not able to estimate the total costs of implementing the settlement
agreement and consent order with the mpca (described above under
environmental matters and litigation - regulatory matters), the
company increased its other environmental liabilities by an additional $13
million in the second quarter of 2007 to reflect its best estimate of the
specific payment obligations under that agreement.
it
is difficult to estimate the cost of environmental compliance and remediation
given the uncertainties regarding the interpretation and enforcement of
applicable environmental laws and regulations, the extent of environmental
contamination and the existence of alternate cleanup methods. developments may
occur that could affect the companys current assessment, including, but not
limited to: (i)changes in the information available regarding the
environmental impact of the companys operations and products; (ii)changes
in environmental regulations, changes in permissible levels of specific
compounds in drinking water sources, or changes in enforcement theories and
policies, including efforts to recover natural resource damages; (iii)new
and evolving analytical and remediation techniques; (iv)success in
allocating liability to other potentially responsible parties; and (v)the
financial viability of other potentially responsible parties and third-party
indemnitors.
note 14.
employee savings and stock ownership plans
the company sponsors employee savings plans under section401(k)of
the internal revenue code. these plans are offered to substantially all regular
u.s. employees. employee contributions of up to 6% of compensation are matched
at rates ranging from 35% to 50%, with additional company contributions
depending upon company performance. all company contributions initially are
invested in 3m common stock, with employee contributions invested in a number
of investment funds pursuant to their elections. vested employees may diversify
their 3m shares into other investment options.
the company maintains an employee stock ownership plan (esop). this plan
was established in 1989 as a cost-effective way of funding the majority of the
companys contributions under 401(k)employee savings plans. total esop
shares are considered to be shares outstanding for earnings per share
calculations.
dividends
on shares held by the esop are paid to the esop trust and, together with
company contributions, are used by the esop to repay principal and interest on
the outstanding esop debt. the tax benefit related to dividends paid on
unallocated shares was charged directly to equity and totaled approximately $3
million in 2007, $3 million in 2006, and $4million in 2005. over the life
of the esop debt, shares are released for allocation to participants based on
the ratio of the current years debt service to the remaining debt service
prior to the current payment.
the
esop has been the primary funding source for the companys employee savings
plans. as permitted by aicpa statement of position 93-6, employers accounting
for employee stock ownership plans, the company has elected to continue its
practices, which are based on statement of position 76-3, accounting practices
for certain employee stock ownership plans and subsequent consensus of the
eitf of the fasb. accordingly, the debt of the esop is recorded as debt, and
shares pledged as collateral are reported as unearned compensation in the
consolidated balance sheet and consolidated statement of changes in
stockholders equity and comprehensive income. unearned compensation is reduced
symmetrically as the esop makes principal payments on the debt. expenses
related to the esop include total debt service on the notes, less dividends.
the company contributes treasury shares, accounted for at fair value, to
employee savings plans to cover obligations not funded by the esop (reported as
an employee benefit expense).

15. management stock ownership program
(msop) and general employees stock purchase plan (gespp)
the company issues
msop options to eligible employees annually in mayusing the closing stock
price on the grant date, which is the date of the annual stockholders meeting.
in may2005, shareholders approved 36.75 million shares for issuance under
the msop in the form of management stock options, restricted stock, restricted
stock units and stock appreciation rights. under the plan, the company has
principally issued stock options to management employees that are granted at
market value on the date of grant. prior to
2005, under previous plans, these options were generally exercisable one year
after the date of grant, with expiration 10 years from the date of grant.
effective with the may2005 grant, the company changed its vesting period
from one to three years with the expiration date remaining at 10 years from
date of grant. in addition to grants to management employees, the
company makes other minor stock option grants to employees, for which vesting
terms and option lives are not substantially different, and also makes minor
grants of restricted stock units and other stock-based grants.
outstanding shares under option include grants from previous plans.
there were approximately 15,400 participants in the plan with either
outstanding options or restricted stock units at december31, 2007.

for options
outstanding at december31, 2007, the weighted-average remaining
contractual life was 66 months and the aggregate intrinsic value was $1.070
billion. for options exercisable at december31, 2007, the
weighted-average remaining contractual life was 57 months and the aggregate
intrinsic value was $1.042 billion. as of december31, 2007, there was
$118 million of compensation expense that has yet to be recognized related to
non-vested stock option-based awards. this expense is expected to be recognized
over the remaining vesting period with a weighted-average life of 18 months.
the total intrinsic values of stock options exercised during 2007, 2006 and
2005, respectively, was $373 million, $289 million and $278 million. cash
received from options exercised during 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, was
$692 million, $414 million and $437 million.
the companys
actual tax benefits realized for the tax deductions related to the exercise of
employee stock options for 2007, 2006 and 2005, respectively, was $122 million,
$93 million and $95 million. the company does not have a specific policy to repurchase
common shares to mitigate the dilutive impact of options; however, the company
has historically made adequate discretionary purchases, based on cash
availability, market trends and other factors, to satisfy stock option exercise
activity.
beginning
in 2007, the company began reducing the number of traditional stock options
granted under its long-term incentive compensation plan by reducing the number
of employees eligible to receive annual grants and by shifting a
portion of the annual
grant away from traditional stock options primarily to restricted stock units.
these changes will reduce the annual dilution impact from 1.5% of total
outstanding common stock to about 1%. however, associated with the reduction in
the number of eligible employees, the company provided a one-time buyout
grant to the impacted employees, which resulted in increased stock-based
compensation expense in 2007. the following table summarizes msop restricted

*weighted average
as of december31,
2007, there was $97 million of compensation expense that has yet to be
recognized related to non-vested restricted stock and restricted stock units.
this expense is expected to be recognized over the remaining vesting period
with a weighted-average life of 39 months. the total fair value of restricted
stock and restricted stock units that vested during the twelve-month periods
ended december31, 2007 and 2006 was $6 million and $5 million,
respectively.
in addition, the
company issues cash settled restricted stock units and stock appreciation
rights in certain countries. these grants do not result in the issuance of
common stock and are considered immaterial by the company.
the
remaining total msop shares available for grant under the 2005 msop program are
4,408,083, 13,074,202 and 24,937,892, respectively, as of december 31, 2007,
2006 and 2005. restricted stock and restricted stock units, per the 2005 msop
program, shall be counted against the total shares available as 2.45 shares for
every one share issued in connection with that award.
effective with the may2005
grant, the company no longer issues options eligible for additional progressive
(reload) options; however, when a progressive option is issued upon the
exercise of a pre-may2005 non-qualified stock option, the option is
revalued and additional stock compensation expense is incurred.
for

in connection with the
adoption of sfas no.123r, in 2005 the company reviewed and updated, among
other things, its volatility and expected term assumptions. expected volatility
is a statistical measure of the amount by which a stock price is expected to
fluctuate during a period. for the 2007, 2006 and 2005 annual grant date, the
company estimated the expected volatility based upon the average of the most
recent one year volatility, the median of the term of the expected life rolling
volatility, the median of the most recent term of the expected life volatility
of 3m stock, and the implied volatility on the grant date. the expected term
assumption is based on the weighted average of historical grants and assuming
that options outstanding are exercised at the midpoint of the future remaining
term.
as previously mentioned, the company expanded its utilization of
restricted stock units in conjunction with the may2007 msop annual grant.
the may2007 annual restricted stock unit grant does not accrue dividends
during the vesting period and vests over three years. the 2007 one-time
buyout restricted stock unit grant vests over five years.
general employees stock purchase
plan (gespp):
in
may1997, shareholders approved 30 million shares for issuance under the
companys gespp. substantially all employees are eligible to participate in the
plan. participants are granted options at 85% of market value at the date of
grant. there are no gespp shares under option at the beginning or end of each
year because options are granted on the first business day and exercised on the
last business day of the same month.

*weighted
average
the weighted-average fair
value per option granted during 2007, 2006 and 2005 was $12.24, $11.51 and
$11.67, respectively. the fair value of gespp options was based on the 15%
purchase price discount. the company recognized compensation expense for gessp
options of $18 million in 2007, $19 million in 2006, and $19 million in 2005.
msop / gespp stock-based
compensation expense:
the impact of stock-based
compensation on net income and earnings per share provided below for the year
ended december31, 2005, was recognized over the nominal vesting period,
whereby if an employee retired before the end of the vesting period, the
company would recognize any remaining unrecognized compensation cost at the
date of retirement. sfas no.123r requires recognition under a
non-substantive vesting period approach, requiring compensation expense
recognition when an employee is eligible to retire. 3m employees in the united
states are eligible to retire beginning at age 55 and after having completed
five years of service. approximately 25% of the number of stock-based compensation
awards are made to this population. the company changed to the non-substantive
vesting period approach for new stock compensation grants made after the
companys adoption of sfas no.123r on january1, 2006. therefore,
primarily beginning in may2006 with the annual msop grant, immediate
expensing of those stock-based compensation awards granted to employees
eligible to retire resulted in higher compensation expense than historically
recognized in comparable prior periods. capitalized stock-based compensation
amounts were not material for 2007, 2006 and 2005. the income tax benefits can
fluctuate by period due to the amount of incentive stock options (iso)
exercised since the company receives the iso tax benefit upon exercise. the
company last granted isos in 2002. amounts recognized in the financial
statements with respect to both the msop and gespp are as follows:

16. business segments
effective
in the first quarter of 2007, 3m made certain changes to its business segments
in its continuing effort to drive growth by aligning businesses around markets
and customers. the most significant of these changes are summarized as follows:
3ms new emerging business opportunity in its track and trace
initiative resulted in the merging of a number of formerly separate efforts
into one concerted effort for future growth. track and trace has a growing
array of applications  from tracking packages to managing medical and legal
records. the establishment of this new initiative within 3ms safety, security
and protection services segment resulted in the transfer of certain businesses
to this segment from other segments, including the transfer of highjump
software inc., a 3m u.s.-based subsidiary that provides supply chain execution
software and solutions (industrial and transportation segment) and the transfer
of certain track and trace products from the electro and communications
segment.
3ms visual systems business (consumer and office segment), which
offers analog overhead and electronic projectors and film, was transferred to
the electro and communications segment. this transfer is intended to leverage
common markets, customers, suppliers and technologies.
3ms industrial and transportation segment (energy and advanced
materials business) transferred the 3m aluminum conductor composite reinforced
(accr) electrical power cable to the electro and communications segment
(electrical markets business). with an aluminum-based metal matrix at its core,
the accr product increases transmission capacity for existing power lines. the
electrical markets business sells insulating, testing and connecting products
to various markets, including the electric utility markets.
certain adhesives and tapes in the industrial and transportation
segment (industrial adhesives and tapes business) were transferred to the
consumer and office segment (primarily related to the construction and home
improvement business and the stationery products business) and to the electro
and communications segment (electronics markets materials business). certain
maintenance-free respirator products for the consumer market in 3ms safety,
security and protection services segment were transferred to the consumer and
office segment (construction and home improvement business).
3m transferred film manufacturing and supply chain operations, a
resource for the manufacturing and development of films and materials, to the
display and graphics business from corporate and unallocated.
the financial information
presented herein reflects the impact of all of the preceding changes for all
periods presented.
3ms businesses are
organized, managed and internally grouped into segments based on differences in
products, technologies and services. 3m
continues to manage its operations in six operating business segments:
industrial and transportation segment, health care segment, display and
graphics segment, consumer and office segment, safety, security and protection
services segment and electro and communications segment. 3ms six business
segments bring together common or related 3m technologies, enhancing the
development of innovative products and services and providing for efficient
sharing of business resources. these segments have worldwide responsibility for
virtually all 3m product lines. 3m is not dependent on any single
product or market. certain small businesses
and lab-sponsored products, as well as various corporate assets and expenses,
are not allocated to the business segments.
transactions among
reportable segments are recorded at cost. 3m is an integrated enterprise
characterized by substantial intersegment cooperation, cost allocations and
inventory transfers. therefore, management does not represent that these
segments, if operated independently, would report the operating income and
other financial information shown. the allocations resulting from the shared
utilization of assets are not necessarily indicative of the underlying activity
for segment assets, depreciation and amortization, and capital expenditures.

segment assets for the operating business segments (excluding corporate
and unallocated) primarily include accounts receivable; inventory; property,
plant and equipment  net;
goodwill and intangible assets; and other miscellaneous assets. assets included
in corporate and unallocated principally are cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities; insurance receivables; deferred income taxes; certain
investments and other assets, including prepaid pension assets; and certain
unallocated property, plant and equipment. corporate and unallocated assets can
change from year to year due to changes in cash, cash equivalents and
marketable securities, changes in prepaid pension and postretirement benefits,
and changes in other unallocated asset categories. for management reporting
purposes, corporate goodwill (which at december31, 2007, totaled
approximately $400million) is not allocated to the six operating business
segments. in note 3, corporate goodwill has been allocated to the respective
market segments as required by sfas no.142 for impairment testing.
corporate and unallocated operating income principally includes
corporate investment gains and losses, certain derivative gains and losses,
insurance-related gains and losses, certain litigation expenses, corporate
restructuring program charges and other miscellaneous items. because this
category includes a variety of miscellaneous items, it is subject to
fluctuation on a quarterly and annual basis.
refer to note 2 and note 4 for discussion of items that significantly
impact business segment reported results. the most significant items impacting
both 2007 and 2006 results are the net gain on sale of the pharmaceuticals
business (within the health care segment) and restructuring and other actions.

gross profit is
calculated as net sales minus cost of sales. in 2007, gains on sales of
businesses and real estate, net of restructuring and other items, increased net
income by $448 million, or $0.62 per diluted share, with $422 million, or $0.57
per diluted share recorded in the first quarter of 2007. 2007 included net
benefits from gains
related to the sale of businesses and a gain
on sale of real estate, which were partially offset by increases in environmental
liabilities, restructuring actions, and other exit activities. in 2006, a gain
on sale, net of restructuring and other items, increased net income by $438
million, or $0.57 per diluted share, with $354 million, or $0.47 per diluted
share, recorded in the fourth quarter of 2006. 2006 included net benefits from gains related to the sale of certain
portions of 3ms branded pharmaceuticals business and favorable income tax adjustments, which were partially
offset by restructuring actions, acquired in-process research and development
expenses, settlement costs of a previously disclosed antitrust class action,
and environmental obligations related to the pharmaceuticals business.
item 9. changes in and disagreements with accountants on accounting
and financial disclosure.
none.
item 9a. controls and procedures.
a. the company carried out an evaluation, under the
supervision and with the participation of its management, including the chief
executive officer and chief financial officer, of the effectiveness of the
design and operation of the companys disclosure controls and procedures (as
defined in the exchange act rule13a-15(e))
as of the end of the period covered by this report. based upon that evaluation,
the chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that the
companys disclosure controls and procedures are effective.
b. the companys
management is responsible for establishing and maintaining an adequate system
of internal control over financial reporting, as defined in the exchange act rule13a-15(f).
the management conducted an assessment of the companys internal control over
financial reporting based on the framework established by the committee of
sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission in internal control  integrated framework.
based on the assessment, the management concluded that, as of december31,
2007, the companys internal control over financial reporting is effective. the
companys internal control over financial reporting as of december31,
2007 has been audited by pricewaterhousecoopers llp, an independent registered
public accounting firm, as stated in their report which is included herein,
which expresses an unqualified opinion on the effectiveness of the companys
internal control over financial reporting as of december31, 2007.
c. there was no
change in the companys internal control over financial reporting that occurred
during the companys most recently completed fiscal quarter that has materially
affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, the companys internal
control over financial reporting.
item 9b. other information.
effective march31, 2007, 3m voluntarily delisted from nyse arca
inc., formerly the pacific exchange, to eliminate duplicative administrative
requirements and costs inherent with dual listings as a result of the nyse
groups recent merger with archipelago holdings, the parent company of nyse
arca. 3m does not believe that withdrawing its listing from nyse arca inc. will
have any impact on the liquidity of its stock. nyse arca will continue to trade
3m stock on an unlisted trading privilege basis. 3ms common stock will
continue to be listed on the new york stock exchange, the companys principal
listing exchange.
