A

REPRESENTATIVES



HAS CONTRIBUTED

SIGNIFICANTLY TO 3MS POSITION IN THE MARKETPLACE AND TO ITS GROWTH. 3M HAS 157

SALES OFFICES WORLDWIDE, WITH NINE IN THE UNITED STATES AND 148

INTERNATIONALLY.

RESEARCH AND PATENTS

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT CONSTITUTES AN IMPORTANT PART OF 3MS

ACTIVITIES AND HAS BEEN A MAJOR DRIVER OF 3MS SALES GROWTH. RESEARCH,

DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES TOTALED $1.368 BILLION IN 2007, $1.522 BILLION

IN 2006 AND $1.274 BILLION IN 2005. THE GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS, WHICH WAS DIVESTED IN DECEMBER 2006 AND JANUARY 2007,

INCURRED RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES OF APPROXIMATELY $120

MILLION IN 2006 AND $142 MILLION IN 2005. THE 2006 AMOUNT ALSO INCLUDED A $95

MILLION

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGE (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2) AND $75

MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS (NOTE 4). RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, COVERING

BASIC SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES IN THE

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW AND IMPROVED PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, TOTALED $788 MILLION

IN 2007, COMPARED TO $943 MILLION IN 2006, DECREASING DUE TO THE $95 MILLION

FOR PURCHASED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DISCUSSED ABOVE AND ALSO DUE

TO THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS DIVESTITURE. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES

TOTALED $818 MILLION IN 2005. RELATED EXPENSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE TECHNICAL

SUPPORT PROVIDED BY 3M TO EXISTING CUSTOMERS WHO ARE USING 3M PRODUCTS, AND THE

COSTS OF INTERNALLY DEVELOPED PATENTS.

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS ARE SOLD AROUND THE WORLD UNDER VARIOUS

TRADEMARKS THAT ARE IMPORTANT TO THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ALSO OWNS, OR HOLDS

LICENSES TO USE, NUMEROUS U.S. AND FOREIGN PATENTS. THE COMPANYS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES GENERATE A STEADY STREAM OF INVENTIONS THAT ARE COVERED

BY NEW PATENTS. PATENTS APPLICABLE TO SPECIFIC PRODUCTS EXTEND FOR VARYING

PERIODS ACCORDING TO THE DATE OF PATENT APPLICATION FILING OR PATENT GRANT AND

THE LEGAL TERM OF PATENTS IN THE VARIOUS COUNTRIES WHERE PATENT PROTECTION IS

OBTAINED. THE ACTUAL PROTECTION AFFORDED BY A PATENT, WHICH CAN VARY FROM

COUNTRY TO COUNTRY, DEPENDS UPON THE TYPE OF PATENT, THE SCOPE OF ITS COVERAGE

AND THE AVAILABILITY OF LEGAL REMEDIES IN THE COUNTRY.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ITS PATENTS PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE IN MANY OF ITS BUSINESSES. IN GENERAL, NO SINGLE PATENT OR GROUP OF

RELATED PATENTS IS IN ITSELF ESSENTIAL TO THE COMPANY AS A WHOLE OR TO ANY OF

THE COMPANYS

5

BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE IMPORTANCE OF PATENTS IN THE DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS

SEGMENTS IS DESCRIBED IN PERFORMANCE BY BUSINESS SEGMENT  DISPLAY AND

GRAPHICS BUSINESS IN PART II, ITEM 7.

RAW MATERIALS

IN 2007, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED COST INCREASES

AFFECTING METALS, WOOD PULP AND OIL-DERIVED RAW MATERIALS. COSTS FOR THESE

MATERIALS HAVE REMAINED HIGH THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AND 3M WOULD EXPECT THIS

LEVEL TO CARRY OVER INTO EARLY 2008, WITH SOME MODERATION OCCURRING LATER IN

THE YEAR. TO DATE, THE COMPANY IS RECEIVING SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF ALL RAW

MATERIALS TO MEET ITS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS. IT IS

IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT FUTURE SHORTAGES OF RAW MATERIALS OR THE IMPACT ANY SUCH

SHORTAGES WOULD HAVE. 3M HAS AVOIDED DISRUPTION TO ITS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS

THROUGH CAREFUL MANAGEMENT OF EXISTING RAW MATERIAL INVENTORIES AND DEVELOPMENT

AND QUALIFICATION OF ADDITIONAL SUPPLY SOURCES. 3M MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE

RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND

FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

ENVIRONMENTAL LAW COMPLIANCE

3MS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS ARE AFFECTED BY

NATIONAL, STATE AND LOCAL ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AROUND THE WORLD. 3M HAS MADE, AND

PLANS TO CONTINUE MAKING, NECESSARY EXPENDITURES FOR COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE

LAWS. 3M IS ALSO INVOLVED IN REMEDIATION ACTIONS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL

MATTERS FROM PAST OPERATIONS AT CERTAIN SITES (REFER TO ENVIRONMENTAL AND

OTHER LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES IN NOTE 13, COMMITMENTS AND

CONTINGENCIES).

ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXISTING

CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR

FUTURE REVENUES ARE EXPENSED. RESERVES FOR LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED

REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE

AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY

STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF ACTION. ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE

OPERATIONS GENERALLY ARE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES.

IN 2007, 3M EXPENDED ABOUT $21 MILLION FOR CAPITAL

PROJECTS RELATED TO PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT. THIS AMOUNT EXCLUDES

EXPENDITURES FOR REMEDIATION ACTIONS RELATING TO EXISTING MATTERS CAUSED BY

PAST OPERATIONS. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR ENVIRONMENTAL PURPOSES HAVE INCLUDED

POLLUTION CONTROL DEVICES  SUCH AS WASTEWATER TREATMENT PLANT IMPROVEMENTS,

SCRUBBERS, CONTAINMENT STRUCTURES, SOLVENT RECOVERY UNITS AND THERMAL OXIDIZERS

 AT NEW AND EXISTING FACILITIES CONSTRUCTED OR UPGRADED IN THE NORMAL COURSE

OF BUSINESS. CONSISTENT WITH THE COMPANYS POLICIES STRESSING ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES (OTHER THAN FOR REMEDIATION PROJECTS) FOR

KNOWN PROJECTS ARE PRESENTLY EXPECTED TO BE ABOUT $47 MILLION OVER THE

NEXT TWO YEARS FOR NEW OR EXPANDED PROGRAMS TO BUILD FACILITIES OR MODIFY

MANUFACTURING PROCESSES TO MINIMIZE WASTE AND REDUCE EMISSIONS.

WHILE THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WITH CERTAINTY THE

FUTURE COSTS OF SUCH CLEANUP ACTIVITIES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES OR OPERATING

COSTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE, THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THEY WILL HAVE

A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE

POSITION.

ITEM 1A.

RISK FACTORS.

THE MOST

SIGNIFICANT RISK FACTORS APPLICABLE TO THE COMPANY ARE AS FOLLOWS.

* RESULTS ARE IMPACTED BY THE EFFECTS OF, AND CHANGES IN, WORLDWIDE

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

. THE COMPANY OPERATES IN MORE THAN 60 COUNTRIES AND

DERIVES APPROXIMATELY 63% OF ITS REVENUES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS MAY BE AFFECTED BY FACTORS IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER

COUNTRIES THAT ARE BEYOND ITS CONTROL, SUCH AS DOWNTURNS IN ECONOMIC ACTIVITY

IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION, OR IN THE VARIOUS INDUSTRIES IN WHICH THE

COMPANY OPERATES; SOCIAL, POLITICAL OR LABOR CONDITIONS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY

OR REGION; OR ADVERSE CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, TAX, OR REGULATIONS IN THE

JURISDICTIONS IN WHICH THE COMPANY OPERATES.

* THE

COMPANYS RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY COMPETITIVE CONDITIONS AND CUSTOMER

PREFERENCES

. DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS, WHICH IMPACTS

REVENUE AND PROFIT MARGINS, IS AFFECTED BY (I) THE DEVELOPMENT AND TIMING

OF THE INTRODUCTION OF COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS; (II) THE COMPANYS RESPONSE

TO DOWNWARD PRICING TO STAY COMPETITIVE; (III) CHANGES IN CUSTOMER ORDER

PATTERNS, SUCH AS CHANGES IN THE LEVELS OF INVENTORY MAINTAINED BY CUSTOMERS

AND THE TIMING OF CUSTOMER PURCHASES WHICH MAY BE AFFECTED BY ANNOUNCED PRICE

CHANGES, CHANGES IN THE COMPANYS INCENTIVE PROGRAMS, OR THE CUSTOMERS ABILITY

TO ACHIEVE INCENTIVE GOALS; AND (IV) CHANGES IN CUSTOMERS PREFERENCES FOR

OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING THE SUCCESS OF PRODUCTS OFFERED BY OUR COMPETITORS, AND

CHANGES IN CUSTOMER DESIGNS FOR THEIR PRODUCTS THAT CAN AFFECT THE DEMAND FOR

SOME OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS.

* FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES AND FLUCTUATIONS IN THOSE RATES MAY

AFFECT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO REALIZE PROJECTED GROWTH RATES IN ITS SALES AND

EARNINGS.

BECAUSE THE COMPANY DERIVES APPROXIMATELY 63% OF

ITS REVENUES FROM OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, ITS ABILITY TO REALIZE PROJECTED

GROWTH RATES IN SALES AND EARNINGS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IF THE U.S.

DOLLAR STRENGTHENS SIGNIFICANTLY AGAINST FOREIGN CURRENCIES.

* THE COMPANYS GROWTH OBJECTIVES ARE LARGELY DEPENDENT ON THE TIMING

AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF ITS NEW PRODUCT OFFERINGS, INCLUDING

ITS ABILITY TO CONTINUALLY RENEW ITS PIPELINE OF NEW

PRODUCTS AND TO BRING THOSE PRODUCTS TO MARKET.

THIS ABILITY MAY BE

ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY DIFFICULTIES OR DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, SUCH AS

THE INABILITY TO IDENTIFY VIABLE NEW PRODUCTS, OBTAIN ADEQUATE INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY PROTECTION, OR GAIN MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW PRODUCTS. THERE ARE NO

GUARANTEES THAT NEW PRODUCTS WILL PROVE TO BE COMMERCIALLY SUCCESSFUL.

* THE COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE COSTS

AND AVAILABILITY OF PURCHASED COMPONENTS, COMPOUNDS, RAW MATERIALS

AND ENERGY,

INCLUDING OIL

AND NATURAL GAS AND THEIR DERIVATIVES,

DUE TO

SHORTAGES, INCREASED DEMAND, SUPPLY INTERRUPTIONS, CURRENCY EXCHANGE RISKS,

NATURAL DISASTERS AND OTHER FACTORS

. THE COMPANY DEPENDS ON VARIOUS

COMPONENTS, COMPOUNDS, RAW MATERIALS, AND ENERGY (INCLUDING OIL AND NATURAL GAS

AND THEIR DERIVATIVES) SUPPLIED BY OTHERS FOR THE MANUFACTURING OF ITS

PRODUCTS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ANY OF ITS SUPPLIER RELATIONSHIPS COULD BE

INTERRUPTED DUE TO NATURAL AND OTHER DISASTERS AND OTHER EVENTS, OR BE

TERMINATED IN THE FUTURE. ANY SUSTAINED INTERRUPTION IN THE COMPANYS RECEIPT

OF ADEQUATE SUPPLIES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY. IN

ADDITION, WHILE THE COMPANY HAS A PROCESS TO MINIMIZE VOLATILITY IN COMPONENT

AND MATERIAL PRICING, NO ASSURANCE CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE ABLE

TO SUCCESSFULLY MANAGE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS OR THAT FUTURE PRICE FLUCTUATIONS OR

SHORTAGES WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANY.

*

ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,

DIVESTITURES, AND OTHER UNUSUAL EVENTS RESULTING FROM PORTFOLIO MANAGEMENT

ACTIONS AND OTHER EVOLVING BUSINESS STRATEGIES, AND POSSIBLE ORGANIZATIONAL

RESTRUCTURING COULD AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS

. THE COMPANY MONITORS ITS

BUSINESS PORTFOLIO AND ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND HAS MADE AND MAY CONTINUE

TO MAKE ACQUISITIONS, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES, DIVESTITURES AND CHANGES TO ITS

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE. WITH RESPECT TO ACQUISITIONS, FUTURE RESULTS WILL BE

AFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO INTEGRATE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES QUICKLY AND

OBTAIN THE ANTICIPATED SYNERGIES.

*

THE COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS MAY

BE AFFECTED IF THE COMPANY GENERATES FEWER PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS THAN

ESTIMATED

. THE COMPANY UTILIZES VARIOUS TOOLS, SUCH AS LEAN SIX

SIGMA, TO IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND PRODUCTIVITY. THERE CAN BE NO

ASSURANCE THAT ALL OF THE PROJECTED PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS WILL BE REALIZED.

*

THE COMPANYS FUTURE RESULTS MAY

BE AFFECTED BY VARIOUS LEGAL AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS, INCLUDING THOSE

INVOLVING PRODUCT LIABILITY, ANTITRUST, ENVIRONMENTAL OR OTHER MATTERS.

THE OUTCOME OF THESE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS MAY DIFFER FROM THE COMPANYS

EXPECTATIONS BECAUSE THE OUTCOMES OF LITIGATION, INCLUDING REGULATORY MATTERS,

ARE OFTEN DIFFICULT TO RELIABLY PREDICT. VARIOUS FACTORS OR DEVELOPMENTS CAN

LEAD THE COMPANY TO CHANGE CURRENT ESTIMATES OF LIABILITIES AND RELATED

INSURANCE RECEIVABLES WHERE APPLICABLE, OR MAKE SUCH ESTIMATES FOR MATTERS

PREVIOUSLY NOT SUSCEPTIBLE OF REASONABLE ESTIMATES, SUCH AS A SIGNIFICANT

JUDICIAL RULING OR JUDGMENT, A SIGNIFICANT SETTLEMENT, SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY

DEVELOPMENTS OR CHANGES IN APPLICABLE LAW. A FUTURE ADVERSE RULING, SETTLEMENT

OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN

ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD. FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

INVOLVING THE COMPANY AND THE ASSOCIATED ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES, SEE THE

DISCUSSION IN NOTE 13.

OVERVIEW

3M

IS A DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL MANUFACTURER, TECHNOLOGY INNOVATOR AND MARKETER OF A

WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS. 3M MANAGES ITS OPERATIONS IN SIX OPERATING BUSINESS

SEGMENTS: INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION; HEALTH CARE; DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS;

CONSUMER AND OFFICE; SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; AND ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS.

3MS STRATEGY

CONTINUES TO EMPHASIZE A COMMITMENT TO GROW AT A FASTER PACE, USING A

FOUR-PRONGED APPROACH, WHICH INCLUDES REINVESTING IN ITS CORE BUSINESSES,

DEVELOPING ADJACENT EMERGING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, EXPANDING ON THE COMPANYS

ALREADY WORLD-CLASS CAPABILITIES INTERNATIONALLY, AND ACQUIRING COMPANIES IN

COMPLEMENTARY FASTER-GROWING INDUSTRIES. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND PLANT START-UPS IN 2008, INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN EMERGING

MARKETS AROUND THE WORLD. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES TOTALED

$1.368 BILLION IN 2007. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALED $1.422 BILLION IN 2007, UP

$254 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2006. THE COMPANY EXPECTS CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO

TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION TO $1.4 BILLION IN 2008, PROVIDING THE

CAPACITY TO MEET EXPECTED GROWTH.

IN DECEMBER 2006 AND JANUARY 2007, 3M COMPLETED THE SALE OF

ITS BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS, RESULTING IN GAINS IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2006 AND FIRST QUARTER OF 2007. IN ADDITION, 3M RECORDED A GAIN RELATED TO

THE SALE OF ITS

OPTICOM PRIORITY CONTROL SYSTEMS AND CANOGA TRAFFIC DETECTION BUSINESSES

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007. IN BOTH 2007 AND

2006, THESE GAINS ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND A GAIN ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS. REFER TO NOTE A AT THE END

OF THIS OVERVIEW SECTION FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS. INCLUDING THESE ITEMS, I

N

2007, 3M REPORTED RECORD NET SALES OF $24.462 BILLION AND RECORD NET INCOME OF

$4.096 BILLION, OR $5.60 PER DILUTED SHARE, COMPARED WITH

NET SALES OF $22.923 BILLION AND NET INCOME OF

$3.851 BILLION, OR $5.06 PER DILUTED SHARE, IN 2006. EXCLUDING THE ITEMS IN

NOTE A IN BOTH YEARS, THE COMPANY STILL ACHIEVED STRONG UNDERLYING OPERATING

PERFORMANCE, HELPED BY A 6.7% INCREASE IN NET SALES, WHICH INCLUDED THE

DIVESTITURE IMPACTS DISCUSSED ABOVE THAT REDUCED SALES GROWTH BY 3.8%.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE CONTAINS SALES AND OPERATING INCOME RESULTS BY

BUSINESS SEGMENT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006. REFER TO

IN

2007, WORLDWIDE TOTAL SALES INCREASED 6.7%. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH (WHICH

INCLUDES VOLUME, SELLING PRICE AND ACQUISITION IMPACTS, BUT EXCLUDES

DIVESTITURE AND TRANSLATION IMPACTS) WAS 7.3%, WITH ORGANIC LOCAL-CURRENCY

GROWTH OF 4.9% (INCLUDING 0.7% BENEFIT FROM PHARMACEUTICALS SUPPLY AGREEMENTS)

AND ACQUISITIONS ADDING 2.4%. DIVESTITURES, PRIMARILY THE SALE OF THE GLOBAL

BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS (HEALTH CARE SEGMENT), DECREASED WORLDWIDE

SALES GROWTH BY 3.8%. THE SALE OF THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IS NOT PRESENTED

AS A DISCONTINUED OPERATION DUE TO THE EXTENT OF THE PROJECTED CONTINUING CASH

FLOWS FROM 3MS CONTRACTUAL SUPPLY RELATIONSHIP WITH THE BUYERS IN RELATION TO

THOSE OF THE BUSINESS THAT WAS SOLD.

THE

BREADTH OF 3MS PRODUCT LINES WAS EVIDENT DURING 2007 AS THE COMPANY

EXPERIENCED SOLID SALES GROWTH ACROSS THE PORTFOLIO.

HEALTH CARE LED ALL

SEGMENTS WITH LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH OF 18.3% (EXCLUDING DIVESTITURES).

THIS INCLUDES A 4.4% BENEFIT FROM ACQUISITIONS AND 4.5% BENEFIT DUE TO THE

PHARMACEUTICALS SUPPLY AGREEMENTS.

THE SALE OF 3MS GLOBAL

BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS REDUCED HEALTH CARE SALES GROWTH BY 23.7%.

LOCAL-CURRENCY

SALES INCREASED

10.8% IN SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES, INCLUDING 7.4% FROM NUMEROUS

ACQUISITIONS.

LOCAL-CURRENCY

SALES INCREASED 5.8% IN

INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION, 5.0% IN CONSUMER AND OFFICE, 2.3% IN ELECTRO AND

COMMUNICATIONS, AND 1.8% (EXCLUDING THE IMPACT OF THE OPTICOM/CANOGA

DIVESTITURE) IN DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS. WHILE 3M EXPERIENCED BROAD-BASED SALES

GROWTH, THERE WAS SOFTNESS IN CERTAIN MARKETS IN 2007. WITHIN DISPLAY AND

GRAPHICS, O

PTICAL FILM SALES INCREASED SLIGHTLY YEAR-ON-YEAR, BUT 3M EXPERIENCED

AN ATTACHMENT RATE LOSS IN LCD DESKTOP MONITORS AND LCD TV SEGMENTS,

PARTICULARLY IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2007, AS COMPETITION CONTINUED TO INTENSIFY

IN THIS MARKET. 3M ALSO EXPERIENCED WEAKNESS IN ITS

ROOFING GRANULES BUSINESS

FOR RESIDENTIAL ASPHALT SHINGLES AND IN ITS ELECTRONIC SOLUTIONS BUSINESS DUE

TO SOFTNESS IN CERTAIN SEGMENTS OF THE CONSUMER ELECTRONICS MARKET.

REFER TO THE SECTION ENTITLED PERFORMANCE

BY BUSINESS SEGMENT FOR A MORE DETAILED DISCUSSION OF THE RESULTS OF THE

RESPECTIVE SEGMENTS.

GEOGRAPHICALLY, THE

EUROPEAN REGION (WHICH INCLUDES EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA) LED

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH IN 2007, WITH AN INCREASE OF 11.7%, 7.4% OF WHICH

WAS ORGANIC (EXCLUDING ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURE AND TRANSLATION IMPACTS).

SALES GROWTH IN EUROPE WAS LED BY SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES AND

HEALTH CARE (WITHOUT PHARMACEUTICALS). THE COMBINED LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA

AREA LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 10.6%, OF WHICH 9.6% WAS ORGANIC, WITH

GROWTH LED BY INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION, SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION

SERVICES AND HEALTH CARE (WITHOUT PHARMACEUTICALS). ASIA PACIFIC LOCAL-CURRENCY

SALES INCREASED 4.9%, OF WHICH 4.5% WAS ORGANIC, WITH ALL SIX BUSINESS SEGMENTS

CONTRIBUTING TO THIS INCREASE. UNITED STATES LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED

5.7%, OF WHICH 2.6% WAS ORGANIC. ORGANIC VOLUME GROWTH IN THE U.S. WAS LED BY

HEALTH CARE (WITHOUT PHARMACEUTICALS) AND INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION, WHICH

WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SOFTNESS IN THE ELECTRONIC SOLUTIONS BUSINESS AND WEAKNESS

IN A FEW BUSINESSES THAT ARE IMPACTED BY THE SLOWDOWN IN THE U.S. HOUSING, ROAD

CONSTRUCTION AND MASS RETAIL MARKETS, PRIMARILY THE ROOFING GRANULES,

PROTECTIVE MATERIALS, TRAFFIC SAFETY AND OFFICE SUPPLY BUSINESSES. D

IVESTITURES,

PRIMARILY THE SALE OF THE GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS, REDUCED

SALES IN EUROPE BY 6.6%, IN THE UNITED STATES BY 4.2%, IN THE COMBINED LATIN

AMERICA AND CANADA AREA BY 2.8%, AND IN ASIA PACIFIC BY 1.3%.

CURRENCY EFFECTS INCREASED TOTAL

INTERNATIONAL SALES BY 5.2%, WITH EUROPE POSITIVELY IMPACTED BY 8.5%, THE

COMBINED LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA AREA BY 5.9%, AND ASIA PACIFIC BY 2.0%, AS

THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENED IN AGGREGATE AGAINST THE MULTITUDE OF CURRENCIES IN

THESE GEOGRAPHIC AREAS.

OPERATING INCOME

FOR 2007 INCREASED 8.7% YEAR-ON-YEAR, INCLUDING A

NET 2.2 PERCENTAGE POINT BENEFIT FROM THE IMPACT OF ITEMS DISCUSSED IN NOTE A

BELOW.

OPERATING INCOME MARGINS WERE APPROXIMATELY 25%

IN BOTH 2007 AND 2006, WITH ITEMS IN NOTE A POSITIVELY IMPACTING THESE MARGINS

IN BOTH YEARS BY APPROXIMATELY 2.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

3M GENERATED $4.275

BILLION OF OPERATING CASH FLOWS IN

2007,

AN

INCREASE OF $436 MILLION COMPARED TO 2006. IN 2007, THE COMPANY UTILIZED $4.619

BILLION OF CASH TO REPURCHASE 3M COMMON STOCK AND PAY DIVIDENDS, COMPARED TO

$3.727 BILLION IN 2006. IN FEBRUARY 2007, 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS

AUTHORIZED A TWO-YEAR SHARE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $7.0 BILLION FOR THE PERIOD

FROM FEBRUARY 12, 2007 TO FEBRUARY 28, 2009.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2007, APPROXIMATELY $4.1 BILLION REMAINED AVAILABLE FOR REPURCHASE.

IN FEBRUARY 2008,

3MS BOARD AUTHORIZED A DIVIDEND INCREASE OF 4.2% FOR 2008, MARKING THE 50

TH

CONSECUTIVE

YEAR OF DIVIDEND INCREASES FOR 3M. 3MS DEBT TO TOTAL CAPITAL RATIO (TOTAL

CAPITAL DEFINED AS DEBT PLUS EQUITY) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS 30%. 3M

HAS AN AA CREDIT RATING FROM STANDARD & POORS, WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK,

AND AN AA1 CREDIT RATING FROM MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE, WITH A NEGATIVE

OUTLOOK. THE COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS TO MEET CURRENTLY

ANTICIPATED GROWTH AND ACQUISITION INVESTMENT FUNDING NEEDS.

IN 2007, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED COST INCREASES

AFFECTING METALS, WOOD PULP AND OIL-DERIVED RAW MATERIALS. COSTS FOR THESE

MATERIALS HAVE REMAINED HIGH THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, AND 3M WOULD EXPECT THIS

LEVEL TO CARRY OVER INTO EARLY 2008, WITH SOME MODERATION OCCURRING LATER IN

THE YEAR. TO DATE THE COMPANY IS RECEIVING SUFFICIENT QUANTITIES OF ALL RAW

MATERIALS TO MEET ITS REASONABLY FORESEEABLE PRODUCTION REQUIREMENTS. IT IS

IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT FUTURE SHORTAGES OF RAW MATERIALS OR THE IMPACT ANY SUCH

SHORTAGES WOULD HAVE. 3M HAS AVOIDED DISRUPTION TO ITS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS

THROUGH CAREFUL MANAGEMENT OF EXISTING RAW MATERIAL INVENTORIES AND DEVELOPMENT

AND QUALIFICATION OF ADDITIONAL SUPPLY SOURCES. 3M MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE

RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND

FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

13

IN 2007, THE

COMPANY MODIFIED ELEMENTS OF ITS LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAMS.

WITH THE

MAY 2007

MANAGEMENT

STOCK OWNERSHIP PROGRAM (

MSOP) ANNUAL GRANT

,

THE COMPANY REDUCED THE NUMBER OF TRADITIONAL STOCK OPTIONS GRANTED BY REDUCING

THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ANNUAL GRANTS AND BY SHIFTING A

PORTION OF THE ANNUAL GRANT AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL STOCK OPTIONS PRIMARILY TO

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS. THESE CHANGES WILL REDUCE THE ANNUAL DILUTION IMPACT

FROM APPROXIMATELY 1.5% OF TOTAL OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK TO APPROXIMATELY 1%.

HOWEVER, ASSOCIATED WITH THE REDUCTION IN THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, THE

COMPANY PROVIDED A ONE-TIME BUYOUT GRANT OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS TO THE

IMPACTED EMPLOYEES, WHICH RESULTED IN INCREASED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE IN 2007. STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE TOTALED $0.18 PER DILUTED

SHARE IN 2007, COMPARED WITH $0.17 PER DILUTED SHARE IN 2006. THE COMPANYS

MSOP, INCLUDING RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, IS DISCUSSED FURTHER IN NOTE 15.

THE PRECEDING

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INVOLVE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES THAT COULD CAUSE

RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM THOSE PROJECTED (REFER TO THE FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS SECTION IN ITEM 7 AND THE RISK FACTORS PROVIDED IN ITEM 1A FOR

DISCUSSION OF THESE RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES).

(NOTE

A). IN 2007, GAINS ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND REAL ESTATE, NET OF RESTRUCTURING

AND OTHER ITEMS, INCREASED OPERATING INCOME BY $681 MILLION AND NET INCOME BY

ESTATE, ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 2 (ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES),

NOTE 4 (RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES) AND NOTE 13

(COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES). GAINS ON SALE OF BUSINESSES INCLUDE THE

SECOND-QUARTER 2007 SALE

OF 3MS OPTICOM PRIORITY CONTROL SYSTEMS AND

CANOGA TRAFFIC DETECTION BUSINESSES, AND THE FIRST-QUARTER 2007 SALE OF THE

GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IN EUROPE.

CONCERNING THE REAL ESTATE SALE, 3M

SOLD ITS CURRENT LAB FACILITY

LOCATED IN SUWON, KOREA AND IS CURRENTLY BUILDING A NEW STATE-OF-THE-ART

CUSTOMER-ORIENTED R&D FACILITY CLOSER TO SEOUL AND MANY OF 3MS MAJOR

CUSTOMERS.

IN

2006, GAINS OF SALE OF BUSINESSES, NET OF RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS,

INCREASED OPERATING INCOME BY $523 MILLION AND NET INCOME BY $438 MILLION, OR

$0.57 PER DILUTED SHARE.

OBLIGATIONS, ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 2 (ACQUISITIONS AND

DIVESTITURES), NOTE 4 (RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES), NOTE 8

(INCOME TAXES) AND NOTE 13 (COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES). CONCERNING

SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION AND

CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENTS. ALL BUSINESS SEGMENTS HAVE CONTRIBUTED POSITIVE

PRINTING AND SYSTEMS LIMITED AND THE LATE 2006 ACQUISITIONS OF SOFTMED SYSTEMS

INC. AND BIOTRACE INTERNATIONAL PLC.

IN

2006, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH OF 7.7% WAS BROAD-BASED, AS ALL BUSINESS

SEGMENTS MADE POSITIVE CONTRIBUTIONS TO LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH.

ACQUISITIONS INCREASED 2006 SALES BY 2.1%, DRIVEN BY THE AUGUST 2005

ACQUISITION OF CUNO AND THE AUGUST 2006 ACQUISITION OF SECURITY PRINTING

AND SYSTEMS LIMITED.

COST OF SALES.

COST OF SALES INCLUDES MANUFACTURING, ENGINEERING AND FREIGHT COSTS.

COST OF SALES AS A PERCENT OF NET SALES INCREASED 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT IN 2007

COMPARED TO 2006, WITH THIS INCREASE PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALE OF THE BRANDED

PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS, WHICH HAD LOWER THAN AVERAGE COST OF SALES. RAW

MATERIAL COSTS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY 1% IN 2007, COMPARED WITH 2006. IN 2007,

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXIT COSTS INCREASED COST OF SALES BY $64 MILLION, OR

0.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS. THESE CHARGES PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CONSOLIDATION OF

CERTAIN FLEXIBLE CIRCUIT MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS, THE PHASE-OUT OF OPERATIONS

AT THE COMPANYS NEW JERSEY ROOFING GRANULE FACILITY AND

CHARGES

RELATED TO THE COMPANYS DECISION TO CLOSE AN ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS

FACILITY IN WISCONSIN. IN 2006, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS INCREASED COST OF

SALES BY $143 MILLION, OR 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

COST OF SALES INCREASED 1.9 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2006. APPROXIMATELY

1.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS OF THIS INCREASE RELATED TO NUMEROUS ITEMS, SUCH AS

HIGHER RAW MATERIAL COSTS, SLIGHTLY LOWER SELLING PRICES, AND HIGHER COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH SCALING UP ADDITIONAL MANUFACTURING CAPACITY. IN ADDITION,

THERE WERE SUPPLY CHAIN INEFFICIENCIES CAUSED BY CAPACITY-CONSTRAINTS. FINALLY,

3M ACCELERATED THE PACE OF ACQUISITIONS IN 2006, WHICH INCREASED COST OF SALES

SLIGHTLY FOR THE YEAR. BROAD-BASED SALES VOLUME GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY GAINS

HELPED OFFSET SOME OF THIS IMPACT. RAW MATERIAL COSTS INCREASED APPROXIMATELY

3% FOR 2006, COMPARED WITH 2005.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE

EXPENSES.

SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE (SG&A) EXPENSES AS A PERCENT OF

NET SALES DECREASED 1.6 PERCENTAGE POINTS IN 2007 WHEN COMPARED TO 2006, AS

EXPENSES INCURRED IN 2006 IN THE COMPANYS NOW-DIVESTED GLOBAL BRANDED

PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS DID NOT REPEAT IN 2007. NON-PHARMACEUTICAL ONGOING

SG&A EXPENSES, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, WERE UP

APPROXIMATELY 7% IN DOLLARS, REFLECTING THE COMPANYS CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN

SALES AND MARKETING TO SUPPORT GROWTH MARKETS. IN 2007, SG&A INCLUDES

INCREASES IN

ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, RESTRUCTURING CHARGES AND OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES, NET

OF THE GAIN ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE

($108 MILLION COMBINED NET

EXPENSE), WHICH INCREASED SG&A AS A PERCENT OF SALES BY 0.4 PERCENTAGE

POINTS. 2006 INCLUDED RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND

SETTLEMENT COSTS OF A PREVIOUSLY

DISCLOSED ANTITRUST CLASS ACTION ($238 MILLION COMBINED EXPENSE)

, WHICH INCREASED

2006 SG&A AS A PERCENT OF SALES BY 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINTS. IN DOLLARS,

SG&A DECREASED $51 MILLION WHEN COMPARING 2007 TO 2006, WITH THE CHANGE IN

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS YEAR-ON-YEAR DECREASING SG&A BY $130 MILLION,

PHARMACEUTICAL SG&A SPENDING DECREASING $241 MILLION AND OTHER SG&A

SPENDING INCREASING $320 MILLION, OR APPROXIMATELY 7% IN DOLLARS. THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO CONSTRAIN ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS.

SG&A EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF NET SALES INCREASED 0.2 OF A

PERCENTAGE POINT IN 2006 WHEN COMPARED TO 2005. IN DOLLARS, SG&A INCREASED

$435 MILLION, WITH RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS INCREASING SG&A BY $238

MILLION AND OTHER SPENDING INCREASING SG&A BY $197 MILLION. 3M CONTINUES TO

INVEST IN GROWTH-ORIENTED SG&A AS SALES AND MARKETING COSTS INCREASED

FASTER THAN SALES, WHILE ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES REMAINED RELATIVELY FLAT IN DOLLARS,

ATTRIBUTABLE TO ONGOING COST-CONTROL EFFORTS.

16

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED

EXPENSES.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES (R&D) AS A PERCENT OF

NET SALES DECREASED 1.0 PERCENTAGE POINT IN 2007 WHEN COMPARED TO 2006, AS

EXPENSES INCURRED IN 2006 IN THE COMPANYS NOW-DIVESTED R&D-INTENSIVE

PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS DID NOT REPEAT IN 2007. NON-PHARMACEUTICAL ONGOING

R&D EXPENSES, AFTER ADJUSTING FOR THE FOLLOWING ITEMS, WERE UP APPROXIMATELY

11% IN DOLLARS, AS THE COMPANY CONTINUED TO AGGRESSIVELY INVEST IN FUTURE

TECHNOLOGIES AND GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.

2006 SPENDING INCLUDED A $95

MILLION IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGE (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2) AND

$75 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS (NOTE 4), WHICH INCREASED 2006 R&D AS

A PERCENT OF SALES BY 0.7 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

IN DOLLARS, R&D SPENDING

DECREASED $154 MILLION WHEN COMPARING 2007 TO 2006, WITH THE CHANGE IN

RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS YEAR-ON-YEAR DECREASING R&D BY $174 MILLION,

2006 PHARMACEUTICAL SG&A SPENDING DECREASING $120 MILLION AND OTHER R&D

SPENDING INCREASING $140 MILLION, OR APPROXIMATELY 11% IN DOLLARS, REFLECTING

R&D INCREASED AS A PERCENT OF SALES BY 0.6 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT,

OR $248 MILLION, WHEN COMPARING 2006 TO 2005.

THE 2006 SPENDING INCLUDED A $95

MILLION IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CHARGE (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2) AND

$75 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS (NOTE 4).

OTHER SPENDING INCREASED

APPROXIMATELY $78 MILLION, REPRESENTING AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY 6%

FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS AND RECOGNIZED A PRE-TAX GAIN ON SALE OF $1.074 BILLION

IN 2006 (RECORDED IN THE HEALTH CARE SEGMENT). FOR MORE DETAIL, REFER TO NOTE

2.

OPERATING INCOME.

3M USES OPERATING INCOME AS ONE OF ITS PRIMARY BUSINESS SEGMENT

PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENT TOOLS. OPERATING INCOME MARGINS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL

YEARS HAVE BEEN IN EXCESS OF 22%, HELPED BY SOLID SALES GROWTH AND AN ONGOING

STRONG COMMITMENT TO MAINTAINING OPERATIONAL DISCIPLINE THROUGHOUT 3MS GLOBAL

OPERATIONS. OPERATING INCOME MARGINS OF 25.3% IN 2007 WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED

BY 2.8 PERCENTAGE POINTS ($681 MILLION) FROM THE GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND

REAL ESTATE, NET OF ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES, RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER EXIT

ACTIVITIES. OPERATING INCOME MARGINS OF 24.8% FOR 2006 WERE POSITIVELY IMPACTED

BY 2.2 PERCENTAGE POINTS ($523 MILLION) FROM THE GAIN ON SALE OF PORTIONS OF

THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS, NET OF RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ACTIONS. ADJUSTING

FOR THE PRECEDING ITEMS, OPERATING INCOME MARGINS IN 2007 WERE SIMILAR TO 2006.

IN 2005, THE COMPANY

REPATRIATED APPROXIMATELY $1.7 BILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS UNDER THE

AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (JOBS ACT).

THE JOBS ACT PROVIDED 3M THE

OPPORTUNITY TO TAX-EFFECTIVELY REPATRIATE FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR U.S. QUALIFYING

INVESTMENTS SPECIFIED BY 3MS DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN. AS A CONSEQUENCE, IN

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005, 3M RECORDED A TAX EXPENSE OF $75 MILLION, NET OF

AVAILABLE FOREIGN TAX CREDITS,

WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE 2005 EFFECTIVE WORLDWIDE

TAX RATE BY 1.6%. NO SIMILAR

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING

CHANGE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 47, ACCOUNTING FOR

CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FIN 47). THIS ACCOUNTING

STANDARD APPLIES TO THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND

WHERE THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS EXIST FOR CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUE

OF THESE OBLIGATIONS IS RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS. OVER

TIME THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE AND THE

INITIAL CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE USEFUL LIVES OF THE RELATED

ASSETS. THE ADOPTION OF FIN 47 RESULTED IN THE RECOGNITION OF AN ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATION LIABILITY OF $59 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND AN

AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $35 MILLION FOR 2005, WHICH WAS REFLECTED AS A CUMULATIVE

CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. AT DECEMBER 31,

2007, THE ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION LIABILITY WAS $59 MILLION.

CURRENCY EFFECTS.

3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR CURRENCY EFFECTS, INCLUDING HEDGING

IMPACTS, INCREASED NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION IN 2007, $20

MILLION IN 2006 AND $115 MILLION IN 2005. THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES THE EFFECT OF

TRANSLATING PROFITS FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS; THE IMPACT OF

CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF GOODS BETWEEN 3M OPERATIONS IN THE

UNITED STATES AND ABROAD; AND TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISKS.

3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTION GAINS AND

LOSSES INCREASED NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION IN 2007, HAD AN

IMMATERIAL IMPACT ON NET INCOME IN 2006, AND INCREASED NET INCOME BY

APPROXIMATELY $50 MILLION IN 2005.

PRODUCTS, CLOSURES FOR DISPOSABLE DIAPERS, AND

COMPONENTS AND PRODUCTS THAT ARE USED IN THE

MANUFACTURE, REPAIR AND MAINTENANCE OF AUTOMOTIVE, MARINE, AIRCRAFT AND SPECIALTY

ONLY REFLECTS THE MONTHS FROM JANUARY 2006 THROUGH JULY 2006. THE

BUSINESS, WHICH SELLS PRODUCTS TO BODY SHOPS FOR VEHICLE REPAIRS, LED ORGANIC

FLAT FLEXIBLE WIRING SYSTEMS FOR AUTOMOTIVE INTERIOR APPLICATIONS TO THE GLOBAL

AUTOMOTIVE MARKET. I&T FILED A PETITION FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN AUGUST 2006.

GRANTED A PUT OPTION, WHICH GAVE THE COMPANY THE RIGHT TO SELL BACK ITS ENTIRE

OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN TI&M TO THE OTHER INVESTORS FROM WHOM 3M ACQUIRED ITS

REMAINING LIFETIMES OF SUCH PATENTS, AS WELL AS PATENTS PROTECTING FUTURE

PRODUCTS, RANGE FROM LESS THAN A FEW YEARS TO MORE THAN 10 YEARS. THESE PATENTS

PROVIDE VARYING MEASURES OF EXCLUSIVITY TO 3M FOR A NUMBER OF SUCH PRODUCTS. 3MS

PROPRIETARY MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY AND KNOW-HOW ALSO PROVIDE A COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE TO 3M WITH RESPECT TO SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS.

23

IN

2007, DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 1.8%, EXCLUDING THE

IMPACT OF THE OPTICOM/CANOGA BUSINESS SALE. THE COMPANY RECORDED POSITIVE SALES

GROWTH IN ALL MAJOR BUSINESSES  COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS, TRAFFIC SAFETY SYSTEMS

AND OPTICAL SYSTEMS. THROUGHOUT THE YEAR, COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS SAW STRONG

PERFORMANCE IN THE VEHICLE WRAPPING MARKET WHERE 3M PROVIDES FILMS, INKS AND

OTHER PRODUCTS FOR THIS ROLLING BILLBOARD INDUSTRY. THE TRAFFIC SAFETY

SYSTEMS BUSINESS ALSO EXPERIENCED GROWTH FOR THE YEAR, WITH FASTER GROWTH

INTERNATIONALLY AS THE 3M REFLECTIVE SOLUTIONS FOR HIGHWAY CONSTRUCTION

PROJECTS ARE A PERFECT MATCH IN DEVELOPING ECONOMIES THAT ARE ADDING

INFRASTRUCTURE. IN JUNE 2007, 3M COMPLETED THE SALE OF ITS OPTICOM

PRIORITY CONTROL SYSTEMS AND CANOGA TRAFFIC DETECTION BUSINESSES. 3M RECEIVED

PROCEEDS OF $80 MILLION FROM THIS TRANSACTION AND RECOGNIZED AN OPERATING

INCOME GAIN OF $68 MILLION IN THE DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT IN THE SECOND

MARKET SEGMENTATION, WITH STRONG PENETRATION IN HANDHELDS, COMPUTER DISPLAYS

AND LCD TELEVISIONS. 3M CONTINUES TO

EXPERIENCE

ATTACHMENT RATE PRESSURE IN LCD DESKTOP MONITORS AND LCD TV SEGMENTS, ALTHOUGH

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007 3M SAW A MIX-SHIFT BACK TO 1080P LCD TVS FROM

720P, WHICH IMPACTS 3M BUSINESS AS 3M FILMS ARE USED MORE HEAVILY IN THE 1080P

SETS. 3M BELIEVES OVER THE LONG TERM THAT 1080P LCD TVS WILL GAIN AN

INCREASING SHARE OF THE OVERALL LCD TV MARKET. WHILE 3M REMAINS OPTIMISTIC

ABOUT THE LONGER-TERM PROSPECTS FOR THE OPTICAL FILM BUSINESS, CONTINUING PRICE

AND ATTACHMENT RATE PRESSURE IS EXPECTED IN 2008. DUE TO THIS PRESSURE

, 3M EXPECTS DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS

OPERATING INCOME MARGINS IN 2008 TO DECLINE A FEW PERCENTAGE POINTS WHEN

COMPARED TO 2007 (EXCLUDING THE NET OPERATING INCOME BENEFIT OF 1.3 PERCENTAGE

POINTS IN 2007 DISCUSSED IN THE PRECEDING PARAGRAPH).

3MS

CONTINUED INVESTMENT IN THIS BUSINESS HAS LED TO A SOLID STREAM OF NEW

PRODUCTS. 3MS BRIGHTNESS ENHANCEMENT FILMS PROVIDE AN ENVIRONMENTAL SOLUTION

THROUGH REDUCED ENERGY CONSUMPTION  AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT REQUIREMENT FROM

BOTH RETAIL CUSTOMERS AND GOVERNMENT UNITS.

3M HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT SUSTAINABLE FACTORY

IMPROVEMENTS BY RELENTLESSLY REDUCING COSTS AND BY ADDING NEEDED CAPACITY TO

SECURE FUTURE GROWTH.

IN

2006, THE DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS BUSINESS POSTED LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH OF

6.0%. OPTICAL FILM SALES VOLUMES INCREASED AT DOUBLE-DIGIT RATES IN 2006. 3M

SAW AN ACCELERATION IN THE LCD INDUSTRY DUE TO STRONG CONSUMER DEMAND FOR LCD

TVS, WHICH DROVE RECORD SALES OF 3MS PROPRIETARY OPTICAL FILMS, DESPITE

ONGOING DOWNWARD PRICING PRESSURE IN THESE CONSUMER ELECTRONIC APPLICATIONS.

COMMERCIAL GRAPHICS, A SUPPLIER OF LARGE-FORMAT GRAPHICS SOLUTIONS THAT CUT

ACROSS A RANGE OF INDUSTRIES, DELIVERED STRONG DOUBLE-DIGIT LOCAL-CURRENCY

GROWTH IN 2006. TRAFFIC SAFETY SYSTEMS ALSO POSTED SOLID LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH.

OPERATING INCOME DECLINED BY 9.0%. OPERATING INCOME INCLUDED $39 MILLION IN

RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND SEVERANCE

AND RELATED BENEFITS, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING INCOME GROWTH BY

3.4%.

THESE ASSET IMPAIRMENTS RELATE TO DECISIONS THE COMPANY MADE IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006 TO EXIT CERTAIN MARGINAL PRODUCT LINES IN THE TOUCH

SYSTEMS AND OPTICAL SYSTEMS BUSINESSES.

THE SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES SEGMENT SERVES A BROAD

RANGE OF MARKETS THAT INCREASE THE SAFETY, SECURITY AND PRODUCTIVITY OF

WORKERS, FACILITIES AND SYSTEMS. MAJOR PRODUCT OFFERINGS INCLUDE PERSONAL

PROTECTION PRODUCTS, SAFETY AND SECURITY PRODUCTS, ENERGY CONTROL PRODUCTS,

CLEANING AND PROTECTION PRODUCTS FOR COMMERCIAL ESTABLISHMENTS, ROOFING

GRANULES FOR ASPHALT SHINGLES, AND SUPPLY CHAIN EXECUTION SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS.

IN AUGUST 2006,

3M COMPLETED THE ACQUISITION OF SECURITY PRINTING AND SYSTEMS LIMITED, A

PRODUCER OF FINISHED, PERSONALIZED PASSPORTS AND SECURE CARDS,

WHICH EXPANDS

THE 3M PRODUCT LINE RELATED TO BORDER AND CIVIL SECURITY SOLUTIONS.

3MS NEW EMERGING

BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IN ITS TRACK AND TRACE INITIATIVE WITHIN 3MS SAFETY,

SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES SEGMENT RESULTED IN THE MERGING OF A NUMBER OF

FORMERLY SEPARATE EFFORTS INTO ONE CONCERTED EFFORT FOR FUTURE GROWTH. TRACK

AND TRACE HAS A GROWING ARRAY OF APPLICATIONS  FROM TRACKING PACKAGES TO

MANAGING MEDICAL AND LEGAL RECORDS.

IN 2007, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES IN THE SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION

SERVICES SEGMENT WERE UP 10.8%. ACQUISITIONS CONTRIBUTED 7.4 PERCENTAGE POINTS

OF THIS GROWTH, INCLUDING A CARRY-OVER BENEFIT FROM THE AUGUST 2006

ACQUISITION OF

SECURITY PRINTING AND SYSTEMS LIMITED. IN ADDITION,

DURING 2007 3M CLOSED TWO SMALL, BUT STRATEGIC, GAP-FILLING ACQUISITIONS. THESE

INCLUDED E. WOOD, A U.K.-BASED PROVIDER OF CORROSION PROTECTION PRODUCTS AND

ROCHFORD THOMPSON,

A

MANUFACTURER OF OPTICAL CHARACTER RECOGNITION PASSPORT READERS USED BY AIRLINES

AND IMMIGRATION AUTHORITIES

. SALES GROWTH

WAS LED BY THE RESPIRATORY PROTECTION BUSINESS, FOLLOWED BY THE SECURITY

SYSTEMS, CORROSION PROTECTION AND BUILDING AND COMMERCIAL SERVICES BUSINESSES.

2007 SALES GROWTH WAS HELD BACK BY MARKET SOFTNESS IN THE U.S. RESIDENTIAL

CONSTRUCTION MARKET, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE ROOFING GRANULES BUSINESS.

THE DECLINE IN THE ROOFING GRANULES BUSINESS

REDUCED SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES 2007 SALES GROWTH BY

APPROXIMATELY 1.5%. GEOGRAPHICALLY, SALES GROWTH WAS LED BY EUROPE AND THE

COMBINED LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA AREA. THIS SEGMENT RECORDED A RESTRUCTURING

CHARGE OF $29 MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007

RELATED TO THE

PHASE-OUT OF OPERATIONS AT ITS NEW JERSEY ROOFING GRANULE FACILITY. THIS

INCLUDED FIXED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND EMPLOYEE-RELATED RESTRUCTURING LIABILITIES

. INCLUDING THIS CHARGE, OPERATING INCOME MARGINS

WERE APPROXIMATELY 20% FOR TOTAL YEAR 2007.

IN

2006, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES IN THE SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES

BUSINESS WERE UP 13.7%. GROWTH IN THE BUSINESS WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG GLOBAL

DEMAND FOR PERSONAL SAFETY PRODUCTS, ESPECIALLY RESPIRATORY PROTECTION.

ACQUISITIONS CONTRIBUTED 4.1% OF GROWTH, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SECURITY PRINTING

AND SYSTEMS LIMITED ACQUISITION IN AUGUST 2006. 3M CONTINUED TO INVEST IN

ADDITIONAL RESPIRATOR CAPACITY, SUCH AS A NEW RESPIRATOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY

IN KOREA, WHICH WILL SERVE THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION. 3M ALSO POSTED OUTSTANDING

GROWTH IN CORROSION PROTECTION, A SMALLER BUT GROWING BUSINESS, WHICH SUPPLIES

COATINGS FOR ALL TYPES OF COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL APPLICATIONS IN A VARIETY

OF INDUSTRIES. 3MS ROOFING GRANULES BUSINESS EXPERIENCED A CHALLENGING FOURTH

QUARTER, WITH A SALES DECLINE OF NEARLY 50%, RESULTING IN SALES IN THIS

BUSINESS DECLINING NEARLY 10% WHEN COMPARING TOTAL YEAR 2006 WITH 2005.

GEOGRAPHICALLY,

LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH WAS POSITIVE ACROSS ALL REGIONS OF THE WORLD, LED BY

EUROPE AND THE UNITED STATES.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED

7.1% TO $549 MILLION IN 2006. OPERATING INCOME INCLUDES $10 MILLION IN

RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, PRIMARILY SEVERANCE AND RELATED BENEFITS, WHICH

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED OPERATING INCOME GROWTH BY 1.9%.

ELECTRICAL CONSTRUCTION, MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR; OEM ELECTRICAL AND

ELECTRONICS; COMPUTERS AND PERIPHERALS; CONSUMER ELECTRONICS;

TELECOMMUNICATIONS CENTRAL OFFICE, OUTSIDE PLANT AND ENTERPRISE; AS WELL AS

AEROSPACE, MILITARY, AUTOMOTIVE AND MEDICAL MARKETS; WITH PRODUCTS T

EFFICIENT TRANSMISSION OF ELECTRICAL POWER AND SPEED THE DELIVERY OF

INFORMATION AND IDEAS. PRODUCTS INCLUDE ELECTRONIC AND INTERCONNECT SOLUTIONS,

MICRO INTERCONNECT SYSTEMS, HIGH-PERFORMANCE FLUIDS, HIGH-TEMPERATURE AND

DISPLAY TAPES, TELECOMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS, ELECTRICAL PRODUCTS, AND VISUAL

SYSTEMS PRODUCTS.

IN 2007, THE ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES

INCREASED 2.3%, INCLUDING 1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS FROM ACQUISITIONS. STRONG SALES

GROWTH IN THE COMMUNICATIONS AND ELECTRICAL MARKETS BUSINESSES WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE FLEXIBLE CIRCUITS BUSINESS, WHICH SUPPLIES COMPONENTS PRIMARILY

TO THE INK JET PRINTER MARKET. THIS BUSINESS CONTINUES TO PENALIZE SEGMENT

RESULTS AS THE INK JET MARKET HAS BECOME COMMODITIZED AND AS A NUMBER OF

APPLICATIONS GO END-OF-LIFE. SOFTNESS IN THIS BUSINESS HELD BACK OVERALL

ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SALES AND OPERATING INCOME GROWTH BY 2.5 PERCENT AND

9.3 PERCENT, RESPECTIVELY. OPERATING INCOME INCREASED 17% AS THIS SEGMENT HAS

DRIVEN PRODUCTIVITY IMPROVEMENTS AND TAKEN ACTIONS TO IMPROVE ITS

COMPETITIVENESS. OPERATING INCOME IN 2007 WAS PENALIZED BY A $23 MILLION CHARGE

RELATED TO CONSOLIDATING ITS GLOBAL FLEXIBLE CIRCUITS MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS

AND $18 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, PRIMARILY FOR ASSET IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS DECISION TO CLOSE A FACILITY IN WISCONSIN.

COMBINED, THESE TWO ITEMS NEGATIVELY IMPACTED 2007 OPERATING INCOME BY $41

MILLION AND OPERATING INCOME MARGINS BY 1.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS.

IN

2006, THE ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS ORGANIC LOCAL-CURRENCY GROWTH OF

2.7% WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ELECTRICAL AND ELECTRONICS MARKETS. ACQUISITIONS

CONTRIBUTED 1.3 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO SALES GROWTH. 3M GENERATED GOOD TOP-LINE

GROWTH IN ITS ELECTRICAL MARKETS DIVISION, WHICH SELLS A NUMBER OF INSULATING,

TESTING AND CONNECTING PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS TO BOTH POWER UTILITIES AND MANUFACTURING

OEMS. 3M SAW GOOD GROWTH FROM ITS ELECTRONICS MARKETS BUSINESS, DRIVEN BY

DOUBLE-DIGIT GROWTH IN ITS SEMI-CONDUCTOR AND ASSEMBLIES BUSINESS.

PARTIALLY

OFFSETTING THIS WAS SOME SALES SOFTNESS IN 3MS U.S. COMMUNICATIONS MARKETS

BUSINESS DUE TO HIGHER COPPER COSTS AND A DECLINE IN

3MS VISUAL SYSTEMS

BUSINESS, WHICH TRADITIONALLY OFFERED ANALOG OVERHEAD AND ELECTRONIC PROJECTORS

AND FILM. OPERATING INCOME DECLINED BY 2.6% TO $411 MILLION. OPERATING INCOME

INCLUDED $46 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING EXPENSES, PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS AND SEVERANCE AND RELATED BENEFITS, WHICH NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

OPERATING INCOME GROWTH BY 10.9%.

OPERATING MARGINS WERE

IMPACTED BY RISING RAW MATERIAL COSTS, SPECIFICALLY COPPER COSTS, IN 3MS

ELECTRICAL AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS MARKETS BUSINESSES.

WHILE

3M MANAGES ITS BUSINESSES GLOBALLY AND BELIEVES ITS BUSINESS SEGMENT RESULTS

ARE THE MOST RELEVANT MEASURE OF PERFORMANCE, THE COMPANY ALSO UTILIZES

GEOGRAPHIC AREA DATA AS A SECONDARY PERFORMANCE MEASURE. EXPORT SALES ARE

REPORTED WITHIN THE GEOGRAPHIC AREA WHERE THE FINAL SALES TO 3M CUSTOMERS ARE

MADE. A PORTION

OF THE PRODUCTS OR COMPONENTS SOLD BY 3MS OPERATIONS TO

ITS CUSTOMERS ARE EXPORTED BY THESE CUSTOMERS TO DIFFERENT GEOGRAPHIC AREAS. AS

CUSTOMERS MOVE THEIR OPERATIONS FROM ONE GEOGRAPHIC AREA TO ANOTHER, 3MS

RESULTS WILL FOLLOW. THUS, NET SALES IN A PARTICULAR GEOGRAPHIC AREA ARE NOT

INDICATIVE OF END-USER CONSUMPTION IN THAT GEOGRAPHIC AREA.

U.S. LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES

INCREASED 5.7%, WITH ACQUISITIONS CONTRIBUTING 3.1 PERCENTAGE POINTS. U.S.

LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES GROWTH WAS LED BY HEALTH CARE (WITHOUT PHARMACEUTICALS)

AND INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SOFTNESS IN

THE ELECTRONIC SOLUTIONS BUSINESS AND WEAKNESS IN A FEW BUSINESSES THAT ARE

IMPACTED BY THE SLOWDOWN IN THE U.S. HOUSING, ROAD CONSTRUCTION AND MASS RETAIL

MARKETS, PRIMARILY ROOFING GRANULES, PROTECTIVE MATERIALS, TRAFFIC SAFETY AND

OFFICE SUPPLY BUSINESSES. ASIA PACIFIC LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 4.9%,

WITH ALL SIX BUSINESS SEGMENTS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS INCREASE. SALES IN JAPAN

TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION, WITH LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES UP 2% FROM 2006.

EUROPEAN LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASED 11.7%,

WITH GOOD GROWTH ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS, ESPECIALLY SAFETY, SECURITY AND

PROTECTION SERVICES AND HEALTH CARE (WITHOUT PHARMACEUTICALS). IN THE COMBINED

LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA AREA, LOCAL-CURRENCY SALES INCREASES OF 10.6% WERE LED

BY INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION; SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES; AND

HEALTH CARE (WITHOUT PHARMACEUTICALS).

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION

POSITIVELY IMPACTED EUROPEAN AREA SALES BY 8.5%, THE COMBINED LATIN AMERICA AND

CANADA AREA SALES BY 5.9%, AND THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA BY 2%, AS THE U.S. DOLLAR

WEAKENED AGAINST THESE CURRENCIES.

FOR 2007,

INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 63% OF 3MS SALES.

SINCE

3M SOLD ITS GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IN DECEMBER 2006 AND JANUARY 2007,

BOTH SALES GROWTH AND OPERATING INCOME WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED WHEN COMPARING

2007 TO 2006. SALES IN 2006 FOR PHARMACEUTICALS TOTALED $332 MILLION IN THE

UNITED STATES, $315 MILLION IN THE EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA AREA, $77

MILLION IN THE ASIA PACIFIC AREA, AND $50 MILLION IN THE LATIN AMERICA AND

CANADA AREA.

IN 2007, THE GAIN ON SALE OF BUSINESSES AND A GAIN

ON SALE OF REAL ESTATE, NET OF RESTRUCTURING AND OTHER ITEMS, INCREASED

WORLDWIDE OPERATING INCOME BY $681 MILLION, WITH THE LARGEST IMPACT IN THE

EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST AND AFRICA AREA. IN 2006, THE GAIN ON SALE, RESTRUCTURING

AND OTHER ITEMS INCREASED WORLDWIDE OPERATING INCOME BY $523 MILLION, WITH THE

LARGEST IMPACT IN THE UNITED STATES. THESE ITEMS ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL

EMPLOYMENT.

EMPLOYMENT INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY 900 PEOPLE SINCE YEAR-END 2006,

WITH ACQUISITIONS ADDING APPROXIMATELY 2,500 EMPLOYEES, WHILE RESTRUCTURING AND

THE PHARMACEUTICALS DIVESTITURE REDUCED EMPLOYMENT. EMPLOYMENT INCREASED BY

APPROXIMATELY 4,100 PEOPLE IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005, PARTIALLY DUE TO

ACQUISITIONS, WITH MORE THAN 750 PEOPLE ADDED BY 3MS THREE LARGEST 2006

ACQUISITIONS ALONE. IN ADDITION, 3M HAS INCREASED EMPLOYEES IN FASTER-GROWING

AREAS OF THE WORLD, SUCH AS BRAZIL, INDIA, RUSSIA, CHINA AND POLAND, WHERE ON A

LOCAL-CURRENCY BASIS SALES INCREASED MORE THAN 15% IN BOTH 2007 AND 2006.

CAPITAL SPENDING/NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

THE BULK OF 3M CAPITAL SPENDING HISTORICALLY HAS BEEN IN THE UNITED

STATES, RESULTING IN HIGHER NET PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT BALANCES IN THE

UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY IS STRIVING TO MORE CLOSELY ALIGN ITS MANUFACTURING

AND SOURCING WITH GEOGRAPHIC MARKET SALES, AND BECAUSE APPROXIMATELY 63% OF

SALES ARE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, THIS WOULD INCREASE PRODUCTION OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES, HELPING TO IMPROVE CUSTOMER SERVICE AND REDUCE WORKING CAPITAL

REQUIREMENTS. CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $1.422 BILLION IN 2007 AND ARE EXPECTED

TO TOTAL $1.3 BILLION TO $1.4 BILLION IN 2008.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES

INFORMATION REGARDING SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES IS INCLUDED IN

NOTE 1. AS STATED IN NOTE 1, THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS

OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE AND EXPENSES, AND RELATED DISCLOSURE OF

CONTINGENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. MANAGEMENT BASES ITS ESTIMATES ON HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE AND ON VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS THAT ARE BELIEVED TO BE REASONABLE UNDER

THE CIRCUMSTANCES, THE RESULTS OF WHICH FORM THE BASIS FOR MAKING JUDGMENTS

ABOUT THE CARRYING VALUES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE NOT READILY

APPARENT FROM OTHER SOURCES. ACTUAL RESULTS MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS MOST CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES RELATE TO

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, THE COMPANYS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS AND INCOME TAXES. SENIOR MANAGEMENT HAS DISCUSSED THE DEVELOPMENT,

SELECTION AND DISCLOSURE OF ITS CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES WITH THE AUDIT

COMMITTEE OF 3MS BOARD OF DIRECTORS.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE CATEGORIES OF CLAIMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ESTIMATED ITS

PROBABLE LIABILITY, THE AMOUNT OF ITS LIABILITY ACCRUALS, AND THE ESTIMATES OF

ITS RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES ARE CRITICAL ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES RELATED TO

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. PLEASE REFER TO THE SECTION ENTITLED ACCRUED LIABILITIES

AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS (CONTAINED IN LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS IN NOTE 13) FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT SUCH ESTIMATES.

PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS.

3M HAS VARIOUS

COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S. EMPLOYEES

AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR ITS

DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE

BENEFIT PLANS IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

(SFAS) NO. 87, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS, SFAS NO. 106, EMPLOYERS

ACCOUNTING FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, IN MEASURING PLAN

ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND IN DETERMINING THE AMOUNT OF NET PERIODIC

BENEFIT COST, AND SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87,

88, 106 AND 132(R), WHICH WAS ISSUED IN SEPTEMBER 2006 AND EFFECTIVE AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. SFAS NO. 158 REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO RECOGNIZE

THE UNDERFUNDED OR OVERFUNDED STATUS OF A DEFINED BENEFIT POSTRETIREMENT PLAN

AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND RECOGNIZE

CHANGES IN THE FUNDED STATUS IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR THROUGH

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH IS A COMPONENT OF STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY.

28

PENSION BENEFITS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANS ARE GENERALLY BASED PRIMARILY ON EACH PARTICIPANTS

YEARS OF SERVICE, COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. TWO

CRITICAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS,

ARE IMPORTANT ELEMENTS OF EXPENSE AND LIABILITY MEASUREMENT. THE ASSUMED HEALTH

CARE TREND RATE IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE ASSUMPTION.

SEE NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS USED IN

DETERMINING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE LIABILITIES AND EXPENSES.

THE

COMPANY DETERMINES THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES AS OF THE

DECEMBER 31 MEASUREMENT DATE FOR THE U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLANS. THE DISCOUNT RATE REFLECTS THE CURRENT RATE AT WHICH THE

ASSOCIATED LIABILITIES COULD BE EFFECTIVELY SETTLED AT THE END OF THE YEAR. IN

ESTIMATING THIS RATE, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT RATES OF RETURN ON FIXED-INCOME

INVESTMENTS OF SIMILAR DURATION TO THE LIABILITIES IN THE PLAN THAT RECEIVE

HIGH, INVESTMENT GRADE RATINGS BY RECOGNIZED RATINGS AGENCIES. USING THIS

METHODOLOGY, THE COMPANY DETERMINED A DISCOUNT RATE OF 6.00% TO BE APPROPRIATE

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF 0.25 OF A PERCENTAGE

POINT FROM THE RATE USED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006.

A SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT IN

DETERMINING THE COMPANYS PENSION EXPENSE IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 87

IS THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, WHICH IS BASED ON HISTORICAL RESULTS FOR

SIMILAR ALLOCATIONS AMONG ASSET CLASSES. FOR THE U.S. PENSION PLAN, THE COMPANYS

ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.75% FOR 2007 AND WILL

BE REDUCED TO 8.50% FOR 2008. REFER TO NOTE 11 FOR INFORMATION ON HOW THIS RATE

IS DETERMINED.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2007, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED TOTAL CONSOLIDATED PRE-TAX PENSION EXPENSE (AFTER

SETTLEMENTS, CURTAILMENTS AND SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS) OF $190 MILLION,

DOWN FROM $347 MILLION IN 2006. PENSION EXPENSE (BEFORE SETTLEMENTS,

CURTAILMENTS AND SPECIAL TERMINATION BENEFITS) IS ANTICIPATED TO DECREASE TO

APPROXIMATELY $90 MILLION IN 2008. FOR THE PENSION PLANS, HOLDING ALL

OTHER FACTORS CONSTANT, AN INCREASE/DECREASE IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS OF 0.25 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT WOULD DECREASE/INCREASE

2008 PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $26 MILLION FOR U.S. PENSION PLANS

AND APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION FOR INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS. ALSO, HOLDING

ALL OTHER FACTORS CONSTANT, AN INCREASE/DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE USED TO

MEASURE PLAN LIABILITIES OF 0.25 OF A PERCENTAGE POINT WOULD DECREASE/INCREASE

2008 PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $32 MILLION FOR U.S. PENSION PLANS AND

APPROXIMATELY $21 MILLION FOR INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS. SEE NOTE 11 FOR

DETAILS OF THE IMPACT OF A ONE PERCENTAGE POINT CHANGE IN ASSUMED HEALTH CARE

TREND RATES ON THE POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE BENEFIT EXPENSE AND OBLIGATION.

ASSET IMPAIRMENTS.

3M NET PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT TOTALED $6.6 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. MANAGEMENT

MAKES ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS IN PREPARING THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS FOR WHICH ACTUAL RESULTS WILL EMERGE OVER LONG PERIODS OF TIME. THIS

INCLUDES THE RECOVERABILITY OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS EMPLOYED IN THE BUSINESS,

INCLUDING ASSETS OF ACQUIRED BUSINESSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE

CLOSELY MONITORED BY MANAGEMENT AND PERIODICALLY ADJUSTED AS CIRCUMSTANCES

WARRANT. FOR INSTANCE, EXPECTED ASSET LIVES MAY BE SHORTENED OR AN IMPAIRMENT

RECORDED BASED ON A CHANGE IN THE EXPECTED USE OF THE ASSET OR PERFORMANCE OF

THE RELATED BUSINESS REPORTING UNIT. IMPAIRMENTS RECORDED IN 2007 AND 2006

RELATED TO RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS AND OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES ARE DISCUSSED IN

NOTE 4.

3M GOODWILL TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $4.6 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, WHICH, BASED ON

IMPAIRMENT TESTING, IS NOT IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR GOODWILL IS DONE AT

A REPORTING UNIT LEVEL. REPORTING UNITS ARE ONE LEVEL BELOW THE BUSINESS

SEGMENT LEVEL, BUT CAN BE COMBINED WHEN REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE SAME SEGMENT

HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. THE MAJORITY OF GOODWILL RELATES TO AND

IS ASSIGNED DIRECTLY TO A SPECIFIC REPORTING UNIT. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS GENERALLY

WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING UNITS NET ASSETS

EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED USING EARNINGS FOR THE REPORTING UNIT

MULTIPLIED BY A PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO FOR COMPARABLE INDUSTRY GROUPS, OR BY

USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS.

INCOME TAXES.

THE EXTENT OF 3MS

OPERATIONS INVOLVES DEALING WITH UNCERTAINTIES AND JUDGMENTS IN THE APPLICATION

OF COMPLEX TAX REGULATIONS IN A MULTITUDE OF JURISDICTIONS. THE FINAL TAXES

PAID ARE DEPENDENT UPON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING NEGOTIATIONS WITH TAXING

AUTHORITIES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS AND RESOLUTION OF DISPUTES ARISING FROM

FEDERAL, STATE, AND INTERNATIONAL TAX AUDITS. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES POTENTIAL

LIABILITIES AND RECORDS TAX LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED TAX AUDIT ISSUES IN THE

U.S. AND OTHER TAX JURISDICTIONS BASED ON ITS ESTIMATE OF WHETHER, AND THE

EXTENT TO WHICH, ADDITIONAL TAXES WILL BE DUE. AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007, THE

COMPANY FOLLOWS FIN 48 GUIDANCE TO RECORD THESE LIABILITIES (REFER TO NOTE 8

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION). THE COMPANY ADJUSTS THESE RESERVES IN LIGHT OF

CHANGING FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES; HOWEVER, DUE TO THE COMPLEXITY OF SOME OF

THESE UNCERTAINTIES, THE ULTIMATE RESOLUTION MAY RESULT IN A PAYMENT THAT IS

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE COMPANYS CURRENT ESTIMATE OF THE TAX

LIABILITIES. IF THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF TAX LIABILITIES PROVES TO BE LESS

THAN THE ULTIMATE ASSESSMENT, AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE TO EXPENSE WOULD RESULT. IF

PAYMENT OF THESE AMOUNTS ULTIMATELY PROVES TO BE LESS THAN THE RECORDED

AMOUNTS, THE REVERSAL OF THE LIABILITIES WOULD RESULT IN TAX BENEFITS BEING

RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE LIABILITIES ARE NO

LONGER NECESSARY.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY

THE COMPANY

GENERATES SIGNIFICANT ONGOING CASH FLOW. INCREASES IN LONG-TERM DEBT HAVE BEEN

USED, IN PART, TO FUND SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES AND ACQUISITIONS. ON NOVEMBER 15,

2007, 3M (SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES BUSINESS) ANNOUNCED THAT IT

HAD ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR 3MS ACQUISITION OF 100 PERCENT OF

THE OUTSTANDING SHARES OF AEARO HOLDING CORP.  A GLOBAL LEADER IN THE

PERSONAL PROTECTION INDUSTRY THAT MANUFACTURES AND MARKETS PERSONAL PROTECTION

AND ENERGY ABSORBING PRODUCTS  FOR APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION. THE SALE

IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE TOWARDS THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008.

DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT PHARMACEUTICALS SALES PROCEEDS RECEIVED IN DECEMBER 2006.

3M BELIEVES ITS ONGOING CASH FLOWS PROVIDE AMPLE CASH TO FUND EXPECTED

INVESTMENTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES. THE COMPANY HAS SUFFICIENT ACCESS TO

CAPITAL MARKETS TO MEET CURRENTLY ANTICIPATED GROWTH AND ACQUISITION INVESTMENT

FUNDING NEEDS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT UTILIZE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS LINKED TO

THE COMPANYS STOCK. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DOES HAVE CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE

DEBT THAT, IF CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, IS CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF

3M COMMON STOCK (REFER TO NOTE 10 IN THIS DOCUMENT).

THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY ARE STRONG.

VARIOUS ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, INCLUDING CASH AND SHORT-TERM DEBT, CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY

FROM MONTH TO MONTH DEPENDING ON SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS.

WORKING CAPITAL

(DEFINED AS CURRENT ASSETS MINUS CURRENT LIABILITIES) TOTALED $4.476 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, COMPARED WITH $1.623 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006.

WORKING CAPITAL WAS HIGHER PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS,

SHORT-TERM MARKETABLE SECURITIES, RECEIVABLES AND INVENTORIES AND DECREASES IN

SHORT-TERM DEBT AND ACCRUED INCOME TAXES.

THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY REMAINS STRONG, WITH CASH,

CASH EQUIVALENTS AND MARKETABLE SECURITIES AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 TOTALING

APPROXIMATELY $3 BILLION. PRIMARY SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY NEEDS ARE PROVIDED

THROUGH U.S. COMMERCIAL PAPER AND EURO COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2007, OUTSTANDING TOTAL COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED TOTALED $349 MILLION AND

AVERAGED $1.249 BILLION DURING 2007.

THE

COMPANY BELIEVES IT UNLIKELY THAT ITS ACCESS TO THE COMMERCIAL PAPER MARKET

WILL BE RESTRICTED.

IN JUNE 2007, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH UP TO $3 BILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES

MAY BE OFFERED, WITH REMAINING

SHELF BORROWING CAPACITY OF $2.5 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2007. ON APRIL 30, 2007, THE COMPANY REPLACED ITS $565-MILLION CREDIT

FACILITY WITH A NEW $1.5-BILLION FIVE-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH HAS

PROVISIONS FOR THE COMPANY TO REQUEST AN INCREASE OF THE FACILITY UP TO $2

BILLION (AT THE LENDERS DISCRETION), AND PROVIDING FOR UP TO $150 MILLION IN

LETTERS OF CREDIT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THERE ARE $110 MILLION IN

LETTERS OF CREDIT DRAWN AGAINST THE FACILITY. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007,

AVAILABLE SHORT-TERM COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT INTERNATIONALLY TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $67 MILLION, OF WHICH $13 MILLION WAS UTILIZED. DEBT

COVENANTS DO NOT RESTRICT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS. THE COMPANY HAS A WELL-KNOWN

SEASONED ISSUER SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 24,

2006, TO REGISTER AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES FOR

FUTURE SALES.

THE COMPANY INTENDS TO USE THE PROCEEDS FROM FUTURE

SECURITIES SALES OFF THIS SHELF FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007, CERTAIN DEBT AGREEMENTS ($350 MILLION OF DEALER

REMARKETABLE SECURITIES AND $87 MILLION OF ESOP DEBT) HAD RATINGS TRIGGERS

(BBB-/BAA3 OR LOWER) THAT WOULD REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF DEBT. THE COMPANY HAS AN

AA CREDIT RATING, WITH A STABLE OUTLOOK, FROM STANDARD & POORS AND AN

AA1 CREDIT RATING, WITH A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK, FROM MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE. IN

ADDITION, UNDER THE $1.5-BILLION FIVE-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, 3M IS

REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ITS EBITDA TO INTEREST RATIO AS OF THE END OF EACH FISCAL

QUARTER AT NOT LESS THAN 3.0 TO 1. THIS IS CALCULATED (AS DEFINED IN THE

AGREEMENT) AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL EBITDA FOR THE FOUR CONSECUTIVE

QUARTERS THEN ENDED TO TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE ON ALL FUNDED DEBT FOR THE SAME

PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THIS RATIO WAS APPROXIMATELY 35 TO 1.

3MS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 TOTALED $1.896

BILLION, WITH AN ADDITIONAL $1.059 BILLION IN CURRENT AND LONG-TERM MARKETABLE

SECURITIES. 3MS STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND LIQUIDITY PROVIDE THE COMPANY WITH

SIGNIFICANT FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NUMEROUS OPPORTUNITIES GOING

FORWARD. THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN ITS OPERATIONS TO DRIVE GROWTH,

INCLUDING CONTINUAL REVIEW OF ACQUISITION OPPORTUNITIES.

AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED, 3M EXPECTS TO COMPLETE

30

THE ACQUISITION OF AEARO

HOLDING CORP. FOR APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION IN 2008.

3M PAID DIVIDENDS OF $1.380 BILLION IN 2007, AND HAS A LONG HISTORY OF

DIVIDEND INCREASES. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS INCREASED THE

QUARTERLY DIVIDEND ON 3M COMMON STOCK BY 4.2% TO 50 CENTS PER SHARE, EQUIVALENT

TO AN ANNUAL DIVIDEND OF $2.00 PER SHARE. IN FEBRUARY 2007, 3MS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED

A TWO-YEAR SHARE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $7.0 BILLION

FOR THE PERIOD FROM FEBRUARY 12, 2007 TO FEBRUARY 28, 2009. AT DECEMBER 31,

2007, THE COMPANY HAS $4.1 BILLION REMAINING UNDER THIS AUTHORIZATION, WHICH

THE COMPANY DOES NOT CURRENTLY EXPECT TO FULLY UTILIZE BY FEBRUARY 28,

2009.

IN 2008, THE

COMPANY EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE AN AMOUNT IN THE RANGE OF $100 MILLION TO $400

MILLION TO ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE

A REQUIRED MINIMUM PENSION CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2008.

THEREFORE, THE AMOUNT OF THE ANTICIPATED DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION COULD VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE U.S.-PLANS FUNDING STATUS AS OF THE 2008

MEASUREMENT DATE AND THE ANTICIPATED TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE CONTRIBUTION.

FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS WILL ALSO DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS, INTEREST RATES AND

OTHER FACTORS. 3M BELIEVES ITS STRONG CASH FLOW AND BALANCE SHEET WILL ALLOW IT

TO FUND FUTURE PENSION NEEDS WITHOUT COMPROMISING GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES.

THE

COMPANY USES VARIOUS WORKING CAPITAL MEASURES THAT PLACE EMPHASIS AND FOCUS ON CERTAIN

WORKING CAPITAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THESE MEASURES ARE NOT DEFINED UNDER

U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES AND MAY NOT BE COMPUTED THE SAME

AS

SIMILARLY TITLED

MEASURES USED BY OTHER COMPANIES. ONE OF THE PRIMARY WORKING CAPITAL MEASURES

3M USES IS A COMBINED INDEX, WHICH INCLUDES

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. THIS COMBINED INDEX

(DEFINED AS QUARTERLY NET SALES  FOURTH QUARTER AT YEAR-END  MULTIPLIED BY

FOUR, DIVIDED BY ENDING NET ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE PLUS INVENTORY LESS ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE) WAS 5.3 AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, DOWN FROM 5.4 AT DECEMBER 31,

2006. RECEIVABLES INCREASED $260 MILLION, OR 8.4%, COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31,

2006. CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BY $159 MILLION

YEAR-ON-YEAR, AS THE U.S. DOLLAR WEAKENED IN AGGREGATE AGAINST A MULTITUDE OF

CURRENCIES. INVENTORIES INCREASED $251 MILLION, OR 9.7%, COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31,

2006. CURRENCY TRANSLATION INCREASED INVENTORIES BY $132 MILLION YEAR-ON-YEAR.

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCREASED $103 MILLION COMPARED WITH DECEMBER 31,

2006, WITH $65 MILLION OF THIS YEAR-ON-YEAR INCREASE RELATED TO CURRENCY

TRANSLATION.

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATING, INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES ARE

PROVIDED IN THE TABLES THAT FOLLOW. INDIVIDUAL AMOUNTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS EXCLUDE THE EFFECTS OF ACQUISITIONS, DIVESTITURES AND

EXCHANGE RATE IMPACTS, WHICH ARE PRESENTED SEPARATELY IN THE CASH FLOWS. THUS,

CASH FLOWS FROM

OPERATING ACTIVITIES CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD, AS

PENSION FUNDING DECISIONS, TAX TIMING DIFFERENCES AND OTHER ITEMS CAN

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT CASH FLOWS. IN BOTH 2007 AND 2006, THE COMPANY MADE

DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS OF $200 MILLION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN,

AND IN 2005 MADE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TOTALING $500 MILLION.

31

IN 2007, CASH

FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED $436 MILLION, INCLUDING AN

INCREASE IN NET INCOME OF $245 MILLION. SINCE THE GAIN FROM SALE OF BUSINESSES

IS INCLUDED IN AND INCREASES NET INCOME, THE PRE-TAX GAIN FROM THE SALE OF THE

BUSINESSES MUST BE SUBTRACTED, AS SHOWN ABOVE, TO PROPERLY REFLECT OPERATING

CASH FLOWS. THE CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS ARE

SHOWN AS PART OF CASH FROM INVESTING ACTIVITIES; HOWEVER, WHEN THE RELATED

TAXES ARE PAID THEY ARE REQUIRED TO BE SHOWN AS PART OF CASH PROVIDED BY

OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THUS, OPERATING CASH FLOWS FOR 2007 WERE PENALIZED DUE TO

CASH INCOME TAX PAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $630 MILLION IN 2007 THAT RELATED TO

THE SALE OF THE GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS. NON-PHARMACEUTICAL

RELATED CASH INCOME TAX PAYMENTS WERE APPROXIMATELY $475 MILLION LOWER THAN

2006 DUE TO NORMAL TIMING DIFFERENCES IN TAX PAYMENTS, WHICH BENEFITED CASH

FLOWS. ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND INVENTORY INCREASES REDUCED CASH FLOWS IN 2007,

BUT DECREASED CASH FLOW LESS THAN IN 2006, RESULTING IN A YEAR-ON-YEAR BENEFIT

TO CASH FLOWS OF $323 MILLION. THE CATEGORY OTHER-NET IN THE PRECEDING TABLE

REFLECTS CHANGES IN OTHER ASSET AND LIABILITY ACCOUNTS, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF

CASH PAYMENTS MADE IN CONNECTION WITH 3MS RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS (NOTE 4).

IN 2006, CASH

FLOWS PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED $365 MILLION.

THIS DECREASE

WAS DUE IN LARGE PART TO AN INCREASE OF APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION IN TAX

PAYMENTS IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005. THE HIGHER TAX PAYMENTS IN 2006 PRIMARILY

RELATED TO THE COMPANYS REPATRIATION OF $1.7 BILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS IN

THE UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT

OF 2004.

INVESTMENTS IN

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ENABLE GROWTH IN DIVERSE MARKETS, HELPING TO MEET

PRODUCT DEMAND AND INCREASING MANUFACTURING EFFICIENCY. IN 2007, NUMEROUS

PLANTS WERE OPENED OR EXPANDED INTERNATIONALLY. THIS INCLUDED TWO FACILITIES IN

KOREA (RESPIRATOR MANUFACTURING FACILITY AND OPTICAL PLANT), AN OPTICAL PLANT

IN POLAND, INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES/TAPES FACILITIES IN BOTH BRAZIL AND THE

PHILIPPINES, A PLANT IN RUSSIA (CORROSION PROTECTION, INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVE AND

TAPES, AND RESPIRATORS), A PLANT IN CHINA (OPTICAL SYSTEMS, INDUSTRIAL

ADHESIVES AND TAPES, AND PERSONAL CARE), AN EXPANSION IN CANADA (CONSTRUCTION

AND HOME IMPROVEMENT BUSINESS), IN ADDITION TO INVESTMENTS IN INDIA, MEXICO AND

OTHER COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, 3M EXPANDED MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES IN THE

U.S., INCLUDING INVESTMENTS IN INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES/TAPES AND OPTICAL. 3M ALSO

EXITED SEVERAL HIGH-COST UNDERUTILIZED MANUFACTURING FACILITIES AND STREAMLINED

SEVERAL SUPPLY CHAINS BY RELOCATING EQUIPMENT FROM ONE FACILITY TO ANOTHER. THE

STREAMLINING WORK HAS PRIMARILY OCCURRED INSIDE THE U.S. AND IS IN ADDITION TO

THE STREAMLINING ACHIEVED THROUGH PLANT CONSTRUCTION. AS A RESULT OF THIS

INCREASED ACTIVITY, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WERE $1.422 BILLION IN 2007, AN

INCREASE OF $254 MILLION WHEN COMPARED TO 2006. THE COMPANY EXPECTS CAPITAL

EXPENDITURES TO TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION TO $1.4 BILLION IN 2008. REFER

TO THE PRECEDING 

CAPITAL

TOTAL DEBT AT DECEMBER 31,

2007, WAS $4.920 BILLION, UP FROM $3.553 BILLION AT YEAR-END 2006. THE NET

CHANGE IN SHORT-TERM DEBT IS PRIMARILY DUE TO COMMERCIAL PAPER ACTIVITY. IN

2007, THE REPAYMENT OF DEBT FOR MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS IS PRIMARILY

COMPRISED OF COMMERCIAL PAPER REPAYMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $1.15 BILLION AND THE

NOVEMBER 2007 REDEMPTION OF APPROXIMATELY $322 MILLION IN CONVERTIBLE

NOTES. IN 2007, PROCEEDS FROM DEBT INCLUDED LONG-TERM DEBT AND COMMERCIAL PAPER

ISSUANCES TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $4 BILLION. THIS WAS COMPRISED OF EUROBOND

BILLION IN U.S. DOLLARS, A MARCH 2007 LONG-TERM DEBT ISSUANCE OF $750

MILLION AND A DECEMBER 2007 FIXED RATE NOTE ISSUANCE OF $500 MILLION, PLUS

COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES (MATURITIES GREATER THAN 90 DAYS) OF APPROXIMATELY

$1.25 BILLION. INCREASES IN LONG-TERM DEBT HAVE BEEN USED, IN PART, TO FUND

SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY ACCELERATED PURCHASES OF TREASURY

STOCK WHEN COMPARED TO PRIOR YEARS, BUYING BACK $3.2 BILLION IN SHARES IN 2007.

TOTAL DEBT WAS 30% OF TOTAL CAPITAL

(TOTAL

CAPITAL IS DEFINED AS DEBT PLUS EQUITY),

COMPARED WITH 26% AT YEAR-END 2006.

DEBT SECURITIES, INCLUDING 2007 DEBT ISSUANCES, THE

COMPANYS SHELF REGISTRATION, DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES AND CONVERTIBLE

NOTES, ARE ALL DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN NOTE 10. THE COMPANY HAS A WELL-KNOWN

SEASONED ISSUER SHELF REGISTRATION STATEMENT, EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 24,

2006, TO REGISTER AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES FOR

FUTURE SALES. ON JUNE 15, 2007, THE COMPANY REGISTERED 150,718 SHARES OF

THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK UNDER THIS SHELF ON BEHALF OF AND FOR THE SOLE

BENEFIT OF THE SELLING STOCKHOLDERS IN CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANYS

ACQUISITION OF ASSETS OF DIAMOND PRODUCTIONS, INC. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

USE THE PROCEEDS FROM FUTURE SECURITIES SALES OFF THIS SHELF FOR GENERAL

CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SHELF REGISTRATION, IN JUNE 2007

BILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MAY BE OFFERED. IN DECEMBER 2007, 3M ISSUED A

FIVE-YEAR, $500 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE WITH A COUPON RATE OF 4.65% UNDER THIS

MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM HAS A REMAINING CAPACITY OF $2.5

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES

(FINAL MATURITY 2010) AND $62 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE NOTES (FINAL MATURITY 2044)

ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS THE RESULT OF PUT

PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS CONVERTIBLE

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAS NOT

UTILIZED SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES TO FACILITATE OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCING

ARRANGEMENTS. 3MS ACCRUED PRODUCT WARRANTY LIABILITIES, RECORDED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AS PART OF CURRENT AND LONG-TERM LIABILITIES, ARE

ESTIMATED AT APPROXIMATELY $21 MILLION. 3M DOES NOT CONSIDER THIS AMOUNT TO BE

MATERIAL.

THE FAIR VALUE OF 3M

GUARANTEES OF LOANS WITH THIRD PARTIES AND OTHER GUARANTEE ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT

MATERIAL.

IN ADDITION TO

GUARANTEES, 3M, IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, PERIODICALLY ENTERS INTO

AGREEMENTS THAT REQUIRE THE COMPANY TO INDEMNIFY EITHER MAJOR CUSTOMERS OR

SUPPLIERS FOR SPECIFIC RISKS, SUCH AS CLAIMS FOR INJURY OR PROPERTY DAMAGE

ARISING OUT OF THE USE OF 3M PRODUCTS OR THE NEGLIGENCE OF 3M PERSONNEL, OR

CLAIMS ALLEGING THAT 3M PRODUCTS INFRINGE THIRD-PARTY PATENTS OR OTHER INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY. WHILE 3MS MAXIMUM EXPOSURE UNDER THESE INDEMNIFICATION PROVISIONS

CANNOT BE ESTIMATED, THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS THE CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS THE

RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS.

UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS ARE DEFINED AS AN AGREEMENT TO PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES THAT IS

ENFORCEABLE AND LEGALLY BINDING ON THE COMPANY. INCLUDED IN THE UNCONDITIONAL

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS CATEGORY ABOVE ARE CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO TAKE OR

PAY CONTRACTS, CAPITAL COMMITMENTS, SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND UTILITIES. THESE

ESTIMATES INCLUDE BOTH UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH TERMS IN EXCESS

OF ONE YEAR AND NORMAL ONGOING PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH TERMS OF LESS THAN ONE

YEAR. MANY OF THESE COMMITMENTS RELATE TO TAKE OR PAY CONTRACTS, IN WHICH 3M

GUARANTEES PAYMENT TO ENSURE AVAILABILITY OF PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT ARE SOLD

TO CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECEIVE CONSIDERATION (PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES) FOR THESE UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS.

CONTRACTUAL CAPITAL COMMITMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE, BUT

THESE COMMITMENTS REPRESENT A SMALL PART OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED CAPITAL

SPENDING IN 2008 AND BEYOND.

THE PURCHASE OBLIGATION AMOUNTS DO NOT

REPRESENT THE ENTIRE ANTICIPATED PURCHASES IN THE FUTURE, BUT REPRESENT ONLY

THOSE ITEMS FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED. THE MAJORITY OF

3MS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE PURCHASED AS NEEDED, WITH NO UNCONDITIONAL

COMMITMENT. FOR THIS REASON, THESE AMOUNTS WILL NOT PROVIDE A RELIABLE

INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS EXPECTED FUTURE CASH OUTFLOWS ON A STAND-ALONE

BASIS.

OTHER OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WITHIN THE CAPTION

ENTITLED UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND OTHER, INCLUDE THE CURRENT

PORTION OF THE LIABILITY FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS UNDER FIN 48. THE COMPANY

IS NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF THE LONG-TERM PAYMENTS OR THE

AMOUNT BY WHICH THE LIABILITY WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE OVER TIME; THEREFORE,

THE LONG-TERM PORTION OF THE LIABILITY OF $304 MILLION IS EXCLUDED FROM THE

PRECEDING TABLE. REFER TO NOTE 8 FOR FURTHER DETAILS.

AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 11, THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED MINIMUM PENSION

CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2008 AND COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS TO

ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LARGELY

DISCRETIONARY IN 2008 AND FUTURE YEARS; THEREFORE, AMOUNTS RELATED TO THESE

PLANS ARE NOT INCLUDED IN THE PRECEDING TABLE.

34

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CONTRACTUAL DERIVATIVE ARRANGEMENTS IN THE

ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS TO MANAGE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURE, INTEREST RATE

RISKS AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS. A FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT COMMITTEE,

COMPOSED OF SENIOR MANAGEMENT, PROVIDES OVERSIGHT FOR RISK MANAGEMENT AND

DERIVATIVE ACTIVITIES. THIS COMMITTEE DETERMINES THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL RISK

POLICIES AND OBJECTIVES, AND PROVIDES GUIDELINES FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT

UTILIZATION. THIS COMMITTEE ALSO ESTABLISHES PROCEDURES FOR CONTROL AND

VALUATION, RISK ANALYSIS, COUNTERPARTY CREDIT APPROVAL, AND ONGOING MONITORING

AND REPORTING.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND

SWAPS TO HEDGE AGAINST THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS

DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY FINANCING

TRANSACTIONS. THE COMPANY MANAGES INTEREST RATE RISKS USING A MIX OF FIXED AND

FLOATING RATE DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE BORROWING COSTS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO

INTEREST RATE SWAPS. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY AGREES TO EXCHANGE,

AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FIXED AND FLOATING INTEREST

AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AN AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT.

THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS,

PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL CONTRACTS.

A MONTE CARLO SIMULATION TECHNIQUE WAS USED TO TEST THE COMPANYS

EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN CURRENCY AND INTEREST RATES AND ASSESS THE RISK OF LOSS

OR BENEFIT IN AFTER-TAX EARNINGS OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, DERIVATIVES AND

UNDERLYING EXPOSURES OUTSTANDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE MODEL

(THIRD-PARTY BANK DATASET) USED A 95% CONFIDENCE LEVEL OVER A 12-MONTH TIME

HORIZON. THE MODEL USED ANALYZED 17 CURRENCIES, INTEREST RATES RELATED TO THREE

CURRENCIES, AND FIVE COMMODITIES, BUT DOES NOT PURPORT TO REPRESENT WHAT

ACTUALLY WILL BE EXPERIENCED BY THE COMPANY. THIS MODEL DOES NOT INCLUDE

CERTAIN HEDGE TRANSACTIONS, BECAUSE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THEIR INCLUSION WOULD

NOT MATERIALLY IMPACT THE RESULTS. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE POSSIBLE

ADVERSE AND POSITIVE IMPACTS TO AFTER-TAX EARNINGS RELATED TO THESE EXPOSURES.

THE

GLOBAL EXPOSURES RELATED TO PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS ARE SUCH THAT A

1% PRICE CHANGE WOULD RESULT IN A PRE-TAX COST OR SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $60

MILLION PER YEAR. THE GLOBAL ENERGY EXPOSURE IS SUCH THAT A 10% PRICE CHANGE

WOULD RESULT IN A PRE-TAX COST OR SAVINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $38 MILLION PER

YEAR. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE USED TO HEDGE APPROXIMATELY 1% OF THE

PURCHASED COMPONENTS AND MATERIALS EXPOSURE AND ARE USED TO HEDGE APPROXIMATELY

10% OF THIS ENERGY EXPOSURE.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK.

IN

THE CONTEXT OF ITEM 7A, MARKET RISK REFERS TO THE RISK OF LOSS ARISING FROM

ADVERSE CHANGES IN FINANCIAL AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT MARKET RATES AND PRICES,

SUCH AS FLUCTUATIONS IN INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. THE

COMPANY DISCUSSES RISK MANAGEMENT IN VARIOUS PLACES THROUGHOUT THIS DOCUMENT,

INCLUDING DISCUSSIONS IN ITEM 7 CONCERNING FINANCIAL CONDITION AND LIQUIDITY,

AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND IN THE NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS (LONG-TERM DEBT AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS, DERIVATIVES AND OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND THE DERIVATIVES AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES ACCOUNTING

POLICY). ALL DERIVATIVE ACTIVITY IS GOVERNED BY WRITTEN POLICIES, AND A VALUE-AT-RISK

ANALYSIS IS PROVIDED FOR THESE DERIVATIVES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE LEVERAGED

DERIVATIVE POSITIONS. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DOES HAVE CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE

DEBT THAT, IF CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, IS CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF

3M COMMON STOCK (REFER TO NOTE 10 IN THIS DOCUMENT).

MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR

FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE INTEGRITY AND

OBJECTIVITY OF THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT. THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. WHERE NECESSARY, THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REFLECT ESTIMATES BASED ON MANAGEMENTS JUDGMENT.

MANAGEMENT HAS ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINS A SYSTEM OF

INTERNAL ACCOUNTING AND OTHER CONTROLS FOR THE COMPANY AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

THIS SYSTEM AND ITS ESTABLISHED ACCOUNTING PROCEDURES AND RELATED CONTROLS ARE

DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT ASSETS ARE SAFEGUARDED, THAT THE

BOOKS AND RECORDS PROPERLY REFLECT ALL TRANSACTIONS, THAT POLICIES AND

PROCEDURES ARE IMPLEMENTED BY QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, AND THAT PUBLISHED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS ARE PROPERLY PREPARED AND FAIRLY PRESENTED. THE COMPANYS SYSTEM OF

INTERNAL CONTROL IS SUPPORTED BY WIDELY COMMUNICATED WRITTEN POLICIES,

INCLUDING BUSINESS CONDUCT POLICIES, WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO REQUIRE ALL

EMPLOYEES TO MAINTAIN HIGH ETHICAL STANDARDS IN THE CONDUCT OF COMPANY AFFAIRS.

INTERNAL AUDITORS CONTINUALLY REVIEW THE ACCOUNTING AND CONTROL SYSTEM.

3M COMPANY

MANAGEMENTS

REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND

MAINTAINING AN ADEQUATE SYSTEM OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING.

MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK ESTABLISHED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK.

BASED ON THE ASSESSMENT, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT, AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2007, THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS EFFECTIVE.

THE COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 HAS BEEN AUDITED

BY PRICEWATERHOUSECOOPERS LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING

FIRM, AS STATED IN THEIR REPORT WHICH IS INCLUDED HEREIN, WHICH EXPRESSES AN

UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007.

3M COMPANY

38

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT

REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO

THE

STOCKHOLDERS AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS OF 3M COMPANY.

IN OUR OPINION, THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS LISTED IN

THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX PRESENT

FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF 3M COMPANY AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, AND THE

RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN

THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. ALSO IN OUR

OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, BASED ON

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL 

INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION (COSO). THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IN THE ACCOMPANYING INDEX. OUR

RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS OPINIONS ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ON THE

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR INTEGRATED

AUDITS. WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE

THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDITS TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT

WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT AND WHETHER

EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL

MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDITS OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED EXAMINING,

ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT

ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AND EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT

PRESENTATION. OUR AUDIT OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDED

OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, AND TESTING AND EVALUATING

THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE

ASSESSED RISK. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE

CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY CHANGED THE MANNER IN WHICH

IT ACCOUNTS FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS IN 2005, THE MANNER IN

WHICH IT ACCOUNTS FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT PLANS

IN 2006, AND THE MANNER IN WHICH IT ACCOUNTS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS IN

2007.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION

OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (I) PERTAIN TO THE

MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY

REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (II) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE

BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY; AND (III) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING

PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION

OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT

LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING MAY NOT PREVENT OR

DETECT MISSTATEMENTS.  ALSO, PROJECTIONS

OF ANY EVALUATION OF EFFECTIVENESS TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK

THAT CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT

THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

CONSOLIDATION.

3M IS A DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL MANUFACTURER,

TECHNOLOGY INNOVATOR AND MARKETER OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PRODUCTS. ALL

SIGNIFICANT SUBSIDIARIES ARE CONSOLIDATED. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY

TRANSACTIONS ARE ELIMINATED. AS USED HEREIN, THE TERM 3M OR COMPANY REFERS

TO 3M COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES UNLESS THE CONTEXT INDICATES OTHERWISE.

FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION.

LOCAL CURRENCIES GENERALLY ARE

CONSIDERED THE FUNCTIONAL CURRENCIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES FOR OPERATIONS IN LOCAL-CURRENCY ENVIRONMENTS ARE TRANSLATED AT

YEAR-END EXCHANGE RATES. INCOME AND EXPENSE ITEMS ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE

RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR. CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENTS ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

RECLASSIFICATIONS.

CERTAIN AMOUNTS IN THE PRIOR YEARS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

HAVE

BEEN

RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

USE OF ESTIMATES.

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN

CONFORMITY WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS

OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THE DISCLOSURE OF CONTINGENT ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES AT THE DATE OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND THE REPORTED AMOUNTS

OF REVENUES AND EXPENSES DURING THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACTUAL RESULTS COULD

DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

CONSIST OF CASH AND TEMPORARY INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR

LESS WHEN PURCHASED.

INVESTMENTS.

INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE

OF LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES, REAL ESTATE NOT USED IN THE BUSINESS, VENTURE

CAPITAL AND EQUITY-METHOD INVESTMENTS. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES RELATING TO

INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

INVENTORIES.

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET,

WITH COST GENERALLY DETERMINED ON A FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT BASIS.

PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INCLUDING CAPITALIZED

INTEREST AND INTERNAL ENGINEERING COSTS, ARE RECORDED AT COST. DEPRECIATION OF

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT GENERALLY IS COMPUTED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE

METHOD BASED ON THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF THE ASSETS. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIVES OF BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS PRIMARILY RANGE FROM 10 TO 40 YEARS, WITH

THE MAJORITY IN THE RANGE OF 20 TO 40 YEARS. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF

MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT PRIMARILY RANGE FROM THREE TO 15 YEARS, WITH THE

MAJORITY IN THE RANGE OF FIVE TO 10 YEARS. FULLY DEPRECIATED ASSETS ARE

RETAINED IN PROPERTY AND ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ACCOUNTS UNTIL DISPOSAL. UPON

DISPOSAL, ASSETS AND RELATED ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION ARE REMOVED FROM THE

ACCOUNTS AND THE NET AMOUNT, LESS PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSAL, IS CHARGED OR

CREDITED TO OPERATIONS. PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AMOUNTS ARE REVIEWED FOR

IMPAIRMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET (ASSET GROUP) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN IMPAIRMENT

LOSS WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE

ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS EXPECTED TO RESULT FROM THE USE OF THE

ASSET AND ITS EVENTUAL DISPOSITION. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE

RECORDED IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUE OVER ITS

FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

ANALYSIS.

GOODWILL.

GOODWILL

IS THE EXCESS OF COST OF AN ACQUIRED ENTITY OVER THE AMOUNTS ASSIGNED TO ASSETS

ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION. GOODWILL IS NOT

AMORTIZED. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, AND WILL BE TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT

WOULD INDICATE THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY BE IMPAIRED. IMPAIRMENT TESTING FOR

GOODWILL IS DONE AT A REPORTING UNIT LEVEL. REPORTING UNITS ARE ONE LEVEL BELOW

THE BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL, BUT CAN BE COMBINED WHEN REPORTING UNITS WITHIN THE

SAME SEGMENT HAVE SIMILAR ECONOMIC CHARACTERISTICS. THE MAJORITY OF GOODWILL

RELATES TO AND IS ASSIGNED DIRECTLY TO SPECIFIC REPORTING UNITS. AN IMPAIRMENT

LOSS GENERALLY WOULD BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE REPORTING

UNITS NET ASSETS EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE REPORTING UNIT. THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS DETERMINED USING EARNINGS FOR THE

REPORTING UNIT MULTIPLIED BY A PRICE/EARNINGS RATIO FOR COMPARABLE INDUSTRY

GROUPS, OR BY USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS

ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007 AND DETERMINED

THAT NO GOODWILL WAS IMPAIRED.

INTANGIBLE

ASSETS.

INTANGIBLE

ASSETS INCLUDE PATENTS, TRADENAMES AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED FROM AN

INDEPENDENT PARTY. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH AN INDEFINITE LIFE, NAMELY CERTAIN

TRADENAMES, ARE NOT AMORTIZED. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE ARE

AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, WITH ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES RANGING FROM

ONE TO 20 YEARS. INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT

ANNUALLY, AND WILL BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT

OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY

BE IMPAIRED. INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH A DEFINITE LIFE ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT

WHENEVER EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE

44

CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN

ASSET (ASSET GROUP) MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS RECOGNIZED

WHEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AN ASSET EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOWS USED IN DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. THE AMOUNT OF THE

IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECORDED IS CALCULATED BY THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS

CARRYING VALUE OVER ITS FAIR VALUE. FAIR VALUE IS GENERALLY DETERMINED USING A

DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. COSTS RELATED TO INTERNALLY DEVELOPED INTANGIBLE

ASSETS, SUCH AS PATENTS, ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED, PRIMARILY IN RESEARCH,

DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

REVENUE (SALES) RECOGNITION.

THE COMPANY SELLS A WIDE RANGE

OF PRODUCTS TO A DIVERSIFIED BASE OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD AND HAS NO

MATERIAL CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK. REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE

RISKS AND REWARDS

OF OWNERSHIP HAVE SUBSTANTIVELY TRANSFERRED TO CUSTOMERS. THIS CONDITION

NORMALLY IS MET WHEN THE PRODUCT HAS BEEN DELIVERED OR UPON PERFORMANCE OF

SERVICES.

THE COMPANY RECORDS ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS TO REVENUE FOR CUSTOMER AND

DISTRIBUTOR INCENTIVES, SUCH AS REBATES, AT THE TIME OF THE INITIAL SALE. THE

ESTIMATED REDUCTIONS ARE BASED ON THE SALES TERMS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, TREND

ANALYSIS AND PROJECTED MARKET CONDITIONS IN THE VARIOUS MARKETS SERVED. SALES, USE,

VALUE-ADDED AND OTHER EXCISE TAXES ARE NOT RECOGNIZED IN REVENUE.

THE MAJORITY OF 3MS SALES AGREEMENTS ARE FOR STANDARD PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES WITH CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OCCURRING UPON DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCT OR

PERFORMANCE OF THE SERVICE. 3M ALSO ENTERS INTO AGREEMENTS THAT CONTAIN

MULTIPLE ELEMENTS (SUCH AS EQUIPMENT, INSTALLATION AND SERVICE) OR NON-STANDARD

TERMS AND CONDITIONS. FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS, 3M RECOGNIZES REVENUE

FOR DELIVERED ELEMENTS WHEN IT HAS STAND-ALONE VALUE TO THE CUSTOMER, THE FAIR

VALUES OF UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS ARE KNOWN, CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE OF THE DELIVERED

ELEMENTS HAS OCCURRED, AND THERE ARE ONLY CUSTOMARY REFUND OR RETURN RIGHTS

RELATED TO THE DELIVERED ELEMENTS. IN ADDITION TO THE PRECEDING CONDITIONS,

EQUIPMENT REVENUE

IS

NOT RECORDED UNTIL THE INSTALLATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED IF EQUIPMENT ACCEPTANCE

IS DEPENDENT UPON INSTALLATION, OR IF INSTALLATION IS ESSENTIAL TO THE

FUNCTIONALITY OF THE EQUIPMENT. INSTALLATION REVENUES ARE NOT RECORDED UNTIL

INSTALLATION HAS BEEN COMPLETED. FOR PREPAID SERVICE CONTRACTS, SALES REVENUE

IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE CONTRACT, UNLESS

HISTORICAL EVIDENCE INDICATES THE COSTS ARE INCURRED ON OTHER THAN A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS. LICENSE FEE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EARNED, AND NO

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED UNTIL THE INCEPTION OF THE LICENSE TERM.

ON OCCASION, AGREEMENTS WILL CONTAIN MILESTONES,

OR 3M WILL RECOGNIZE REVENUE BASED ON PROPORTIONAL PERFORMANCE. FOR THESE

AGREEMENTS, AND DEPENDING ON THE SPECIFICS, 3M MAY RECOGNIZE REVENUE UPON

COMPLETION OF A SUBSTANTIVE MILESTONE, OR IN PROPORTION TO COSTS INCURRED TO

DATE COMPARED WITH THE ESTIMATE OF TOTAL COSTS TO BE INCURRED.

ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AND ALLOWANCES.

TRADE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE ARE RECORDED AT THE INVOICED

AMOUNT AND DO NOT BEAR INTEREST. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS ALLOWANCES FOR BAD

DEBTS, CASH DISCOUNTS, PRODUCT RETURNS AND VARIOUS OTHER ITEMS. THE ALLOWANCE

FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND PRODUCT RETURNS IS BASED ON THE BEST ESTIMATE OF THE

AMOUNT OF PROBABLE CREDIT LOSSES IN EXISTING ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND

ANTICIPATED SALES RETURNS. THE COMPANY DETERMINES THE ALLOWANCES BASED ON

HISTORICAL WRITE-OFF EXPERIENCE BY INDUSTRY AND REGIONAL ECONOMIC DATA AND

HISTORICAL SALES RETURNS. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL

ACCOUNTS MONTHLY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

CREDIT EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITS CUSTOMERS.

ADVERTISING AND MERCHANDISING.

THESE COSTS ARE CHARGED TO

OPERATIONS IN THE YEAR INCURRED, AND TOTALED $469 MILLION IN 2007, $471 MILLION

IN 2006 AND $457 MILLION IN 2005.

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

THESE COSTS ARE

CHARGED TO OPERATIONS IN THE YEAR INCURRED AND ARE SHOWN ON A SEPARATE LINE OF

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF INCOME. RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED

EXPENSES TOTALED $1.368 BILLION IN 2007, $1.522 BILLION IN 2006 AND $1.274

BILLION IN 2005. IN 2006, THIS INCLUDED A $95 MILLION IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT CHARGE (DISCUSSED IN NOTE 2) AND $75 MILLION IN RESTRUCTURING

ACTIONS (NOTE 4). RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES, COVERING BASIC SCIENTIFIC

RESEARCH AND THE APPLICATION OF SCIENTIFIC ADVANCES IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

AND IMPROVED PRODUCTS AND THEIR USES, TOTALED $788 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO

$943 MILLION IN 2006, DECREASING DUE TO THE $95 MILLION FOR PURCHASED

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DISCUSSED ABOVE AND ALSO DUE TO THE

PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS DIVESTITURE (NOTE 2). RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSES TOTALED $818 MILLION IN 2005. RELATED EXPENSES PRIMARILY INCLUDE

TECHNICAL SUPPORT PROVIDED BY 3M TO CUSTOMERS WHO ARE USING EXISTING 3M

PRODUCTS, AND INTERNALLY DEVELOPED PATENT COSTS, WHICH INCLUDE

COSTS AND FEES INCURRED TO PREPARE, FILE,

SECURE AND MAINTAIN PATENTS.

INTERNAL-USE SOFTWARE.

THE COMPANY CAPITALIZES DIRECT

COSTS OF MATERIALS AND SERVICES USED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTERNAL-USE

SOFTWARE. AMOUNTS CAPITALIZED ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A

PERIOD OF THREE TO FIVE YEARS AND ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF MACHINERY AND

EQUIPMENT WITHIN PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT.

ENVIRONMENTAL.

ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES RELATING TO EXISTING CONDITIONS CAUSED BY PAST OPERATIONS THAT DO

NOT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE REVENUES ARE EXPENSED. RESERVES FOR

LIABILITIES FOR ANTICIPATED REMEDIATION COSTS ARE RECORDED ON AN UNDISCOUNTED

BASIS WHEN THEY ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN

THE COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF

ACTION.

ENVIRONMENTAL

EXPENDITURES FOR CAPITAL PROJECTS THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CURRENT OR FUTURE

OPERATIONS GENERALLY ARE CAPITALIZED AND DEPRECIATED OVER THEIR ESTIMATED

USEFUL LIVES.

45

INCOME TAXES.

THE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES IS DETERMINED

USING THE ASSET AND LIABILITY APPROACH. UNDER THIS APPROACH, DEFERRED INCOME

TAXES REPRESENT THE EXPECTED FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES

BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND TAX BASIS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE

COMPANY RECORDS A VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO REDUCE ITS DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WHEN

UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THEIR RELIABILITY EXISTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007,

NO SIGNIFICANT VALUATION ALLOWANCES WERE RECORDED.

EARNINGS PER SHARE.

THE DIFFERENCE IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR CALCULATING BASIC

AND DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE IS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DILUTION ASSOCIATED WITH

THE COMPANYS STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PLANS. CERTAIN MANAGEMENT STOCK

OWNERSHIP PROGRAM AVERAGE OPTIONS OUTSTANDING DURING THE YEARS 2007, 2006 AND

2005 WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE COMPUTATION OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE BECAUSE

THEY WOULD NOT HAVE HAD A DILUTIVE EFFECT (21.6 MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR

2007, 31.5 MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS FOR 2006, AND 15.4 MILLION AVERAGE OPTIONS

FOR 2005). AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 10, T

HE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS

CONVERTIBLE NOTES HAVE NEVER BEEN MET. IF THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE

MET, 3M MAY CHOOSE TO PAY IN CASH AND/OR COMMON STOCK

;

HOWEVER, IF THIS OCCURS, THE COMPANY HAS THE INTENT AND ABILITY TO SETTLE THIS

DEBT SECURITY IN CASH. A

CCORDINGLY,

THERE WAS NO IMPACT ON 3MS DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.

IN DECEMBER 2004,

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED SFAS NO. 123

(REVISED 2004). SFAS NO. 123R SUPERSEDES APB OPINION NO. 25. UNDER

APB OPINION NO. 25, NO COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED FOR EMPLOYEE

STOCK OPTION GRANTS IF THE EXERCISE PRICE OF THE COMPANYS STOCK OPTION GRANTS

IS AT OR ABOVE THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING STOCK ON THE DATE OF

GRANT. UNDER SFAS NO. 123R, COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED FOR BOTH

THE GENERAL EMPLOYEES STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (GESPP) AND THE MANAGEMENT STOCK

OWNERSHIP PLAN (MSOP). SFAS NO. 123R REQUIRES THE DETERMINATION OF THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AT THE GRANT DATE AND THE

RECOGNITION OF THE RELATED EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE SHARE-BASED

COMPENSATION VESTS. THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123R EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1,

2006. THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123R USING THE MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE

METHOD. ALL PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RESTATED TO GIVE EFFECT TO THE

FAIR-VALUE-BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR AWARDS GRANTED IN FISCAL YEARS

BEGINNING ON OR AFTER JANUARY 1, 1995. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE

MODIFIED RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION OF THIS STANDARD ACHIEVES THE HIGHEST LEVEL

OF CLARITY AND COMPARABILITY AMONG THE PRESENTED PERIODS. ON NOVEMBER 10,

2005, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION NO. FAS 123(R)-3, TRANSITION

ELECTION RELATED TO ACCOUNTING FOR THE TAX EFFECTS OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

AWARDS (THE FSP). THE FSP PROVIDES THAT COMPANIES MAY ELECT TO USE A SPECIFIED SHORT-CUT

METHOD TO CALCULATE THE HISTORICAL POOL OF WINDFALL TAX BENEFITS UPON ADOPTION

OF SFAS NO. 123R. THE COMPANY ELECTED TO USE THE SHORT-CUT METHOD WHEN

IT ADOPTED SFAS NO. 123R ON JANUARY 1, 2006. REFER TO NOTE 15 FOR

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

TOTAL COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND

THE COMPONENTS OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) ARE PRESENTED

IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (LOSS) IS COMPOSED

OF FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION EFFECTS (INCLUDING HEDGES OF NET INVESTMENTS IN

INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES), DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLAN ADJUSTMENTS, UNREALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES ON AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, AND

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

DERIVATIVES

AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES.

A

LL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE

RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. THE C

OMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS,

CURRENCY SWAPS, AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY

46

ASSOCIATED

WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY MARKET VOLATILITY. ALL

HEDGING INSTRUMENTS THAT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING ARE DESIGNATED AND

EFFECTIVE AS HEDGES, IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. IF THE UNDERLYING HEDGED TRANSACTION CEASES TO EXIST, ALL CHANGES

IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED DERIVATIVES THAT HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED ARE

RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. INSTRUMENTS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING

ARE MARKED TO MARKET WITH CHANGES RECOGNIZED IN CURRENT EARNINGS. THE COMPANY

DOES NOT HOLD OR ISSUE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS FOR TRADING PURPOSES

AND IS NOT A PARTY TO LEVERAGED DERIVATIVES.

HOWEVER, THE COMPANY DOES HAVE CONTINGENTLY CONVERTIBLE

DEBT THAT, IF CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, IS CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF

3M COMMON STOCK (REFER TO NOTE 10 IN THIS DOCUMENT).

NEW ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2005, THE COMPANY ADOPTED FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 47, ACCOUNTING FOR

CONDITIONAL ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS (FIN 47). THIS ACCOUNTING

STANDARD APPLIES TO THE FAIR VALUE OF A LIABILITY FOR AN ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND

WHERE THE LIABILITY CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS EXIST FOR CERTAIN OF THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM ASSETS. THE FAIR VALUE

OF THESE OBLIGATIONS IS RECORDED AS LIABILITIES ON A DISCOUNTED BASIS. OVER

TIME THE LIABILITIES ARE ACCRETED FOR THE CHANGE IN THE PRESENT VALUE AND THE

INITIAL CAPITALIZED COSTS ARE DEPRECIATED OVER THE USEFUL LIVES OF THE RELATED

ASSETS. THE ADOPTION OF FIN 47 EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2005, RESULTED IN

THE RECOGNITION OF AN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION LIABILITY OF $59 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2005, AND AN AFTER-TAX CHARGE OF $35 MILLION FOR 2005, WHICH IS REFLECTED AS A

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF INCOME. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION

LIABILITY WAS $59 MILLION.

IN FEBRUARY 2006,

THE FASB ISSUED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 155,

HYBRID INSTRUMENTS.  SFAS NO. 155

AMENDS SFAS NO. 133 AND SFAS NO. 140, ACCOUNTING FOR TRANSFERS AND

SERVICING OF FINANCIAL ASSETS AND EXTINGUISHMENTS OF LIABILITIES. SFAS NO. 155

ALSO RESOLVES ISSUES ADDRESSED IN STATEMENT 133 IMPLEMENTATION ISSUE NO. D1,

APPLICATION OF STATEMENT 133 TO BENEFICIAL INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL

ASSETS. SFAS NO. 155: A) PERMITS FAIR VALUE REMEASUREMENT FOR ANY HYBRID

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT CONTAINS AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE THAT OTHERWISE WOULD

REQUIRE BIFURCATION, B) CLARIFIES WHICH INTEREST-ONLY STRIPS AND PRINCIPAL-ONLY

STRIPS ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS NO. 133, C) ESTABLISHES

A REQUIREMENT TO EVALUATE INTERESTS IN SECURITIZED FINANCIAL ASSETS TO IDENTIFY

INTERESTS THAT ARE FREESTANDING DERIVATIVES OR THAT ARE HYBRID FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS THAT CONTAIN AN EMBEDDED DERIVATIVE REQUIRING BIFURCATION, D)

CLARIFIES THAT CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK IN THE FORM OF SUBORDINATION ARE

NOT EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, AND E) AMENDS SFAS NO. 140 TO ELIMINATE THE

PROHIBITION ON A QUALIFYING SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY FROM HOLDING A DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT THAT PERTAINS TO A BENEFICIAL INTEREST OTHER THAN ANOTHER

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 155

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007; HOWEVER, THERE WAS NO MATERIAL IMPACT.

IN JUNE 2006,

THE FASB ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 48 (FIN 48), ACCOUNTING FOR

UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES, AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109.

THIS INTERPRETATION WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007. REFER TO NOTE 8

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS STANDARD.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 157, FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. SFAS NO. 157

ESTABLISHES A SINGLE DEFINITION OF FAIR VALUE AND A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING

FAIR VALUE, SETS OUT A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY TO BE USED TO CLASSIFY THE SOURCE

OF INFORMATION USED IN FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, AND REQUIRES NEW DISCLOSURES OF

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON THEIR LEVEL IN THE

HIERARCHY. SFAS NO. 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR ALL FISCAL YEARS BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15,

2007 (JANUARY 1, 2008 FOR 3M) AND IS TO BE APPLIED PROSPECTIVELY. IN

FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED STAFF POSITIONS NO. 157-1 AND NO. 157-2 WHICH

PARTIALLY DEFER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SFAS NO. 157 FOR ONE YEAR FOR CERTAIN

NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND REMOVE CERTAIN LEASING TRANSACTIONS

FROM ITS SCOPE. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACTS AND DISCLOSURES

OF THIS STANDARD, BUT WOULD NOT EXPECT SFAS NO. 157 TO HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS

ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN

AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R). REFER TO NOTE 11

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION CONCERNING THIS STANDARD.

IN FEBRUARY 2007,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 159, THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS

AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES. SFAS NO. 159 PERMITS AN ENTITY TO CHOOSE, AT

SPECIFIED ELECTION DATES, TO MEASURE ELIGIBLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND CERTAIN

OTHER ITEMS AT FAIR VALUE THAT ARE NOT CURRENTLY REQUIRED TO BE MEASURED AT

FAIR VALUE. AN ENTITY SHALL REPORT UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON ITEMS FOR

WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OPTION HAS BEEN ELECTED IN EARNINGS AT EACH SUBSEQUENT

REPORTING DATE. UPFRONT COSTS AND FEES RELATED TO ITEMS FOR WHICH THE FAIR

VALUE OPTION IS ELECTED SHALL BE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS AS INCURRED AND NOT

DEFERRED. SFAS NO. 159 ALSO ESTABLISHES PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS DESIGNED TO FACILITATE COMPARISONS BETWEEN ENTITIES THAT CHOOSE

DIFFERENT MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTES FOR SIMILAR TYPES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

SFAS NO. 159 IS EFFECTIVE FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ISSUED FOR FISCAL YEARS

BEGINNING AFTER NOVEMBER 15, 2007 (JANUARY 1, 2008 FOR 3M) AND

INTERIM PERIODS WITHIN THOSE FISCAL YEARS. AT THE

47

EFFECTIVE DATE, AN ENTITY

MAY ELECT THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR ELIGIBLE ITEMS THAT EXIST AT THAT DATE. THE

ENTITY SHALL REPORT THE EFFECT OF THE FIRST REMEASUREMENT TO FAIR VALUE AS A

CUMULATIVE-EFFECT ADJUSTMENT TO THE OPENING BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS. THE COMPANY

HAS NOT ELECTED THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR ELIGIBLE ITEMS THAT EXISTED AS OF JANUARY 1,

2008.

IN JUNE 2007, THE

FASBS EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE REACHED A CONSENSUS ON EITF ISSUE NO. 07-3,

ACCOUNTING FOR NONREFUNDABLE ADVANCE PAYMENTS FOR GOODS OR SERVICES TO BE USED

IN FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT WOULD REQUIRE NONREFUNDABLE

ADVANCE PAYMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY FOR FUTURE R&D ACTIVITIES TO BE

CAPITALIZED AND RECOGNIZED AS AN EXPENSE AS THE GOODS OR SERVICES ARE RECEIVED

BY THE COMPANY. EITF ISSUE NO. 07-3 IS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M WITH RESPECT TO

NEW ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2008. THE COMPANY IS

CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACTS AND DISCLOSURES OF THIS STANDARD, BUT WOULD

NOT EXPECT EITF ISSUE NO. 07-3 TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON 3MS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN DECEMBER 2007,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 141R, BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, WHICH CHANGES HOW

BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS ARE ACCOUNTED.

SFAS NO. 141R REQUIRES THE ACQUIRING ENTITY IN A BUSINESS

COMBINATION TO RECOGNIZE ALL (AND ONLY) THE ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES

ASSUMED IN THE TRANSACTION AND ESTABLISHES THE ACQUISITION-DATE FAIR VALUE AS

THE MEASUREMENT OBJECTIVE FOR ALL ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED IN A

BUSINESS COMBINATION.  CERTAIN PROVISIONS

OF THIS STANDARD WILL, AMONG OTHER THINGS, IMPACT THE DETERMINATION OF

ACQUISITION-DATE FAIR VALUE OF CONSIDERATION PAID IN A BUSINESS COMBINATION

(INCLUDING CONTINGENT CONSIDERATION); EXCLUDE TRANSACTION COSTS FROM ACQUISITION

ACCOUNTING; AND CHANGE ACCOUNTING PRACTICES FOR ACQUIRED CONTINGENCIES,

ACQUISITION-RELATED RESTRUCTURING COSTS, IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

INDEMNIFICATION ASSETS, AND TAX BENEFITS.

FOR 3M, SFAS NO. 141R IS EFFECTIVE FOR BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND

ADJUSTMENTS TO AN ACQUIRED ENTITYS DEFERRED TAX ASSET AND LIABILITY BALANCES

OCCURRING AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2008.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE FUTURE IMPACTS AND DISCLOSURES

OF THIS STANDARD.

IN DECEMBER 2007,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 160, NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 51, WHICH ESTABLISHES NEW

STANDARDS GOVERNING THE ACCOUNTING FOR AND REPORTING OF NONCONTROLLING

INTERESTS (NCIS) IN PARTIALLY OWNED CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARIES AND THE LOSS OF

CONTROL OF SUBSIDIARIES.  CERTAIN

PROVISIONS OF THIS STANDARD INDICATE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT NCIS (PREVIOUSLY

REFERRED TO AS MINORITY INTERESTS) BE TREATED AS A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF

EQUITY, NOT AS A LIABILITY; THAT INCREASES AND DECREASE IN THE PARENTS

OWNERSHIP INTEREST THAT LEAVE CONTROL INTACT BE TREATED AS EQUITY TRANSACTIONS,

RATHER THAN AS STEP ACQUISITIONS OR DILUTION GAINS OR LOSSES; AND THAT LOSSES

OF A PARTIALLY OWNED CONSOLIDATED SUBSIDIARY BE ALLOCATED TO THE NCI EVEN WHEN

SUCH ALLOCATION MIGHT RESULT IN A DEFICIT BALANCE. THIS STANDARD ALSO REQUIRES

CHANGES TO CERTAIN PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS. FOR 3M, SFAS NO. 160

IS EFFECTIVE BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009. THE PROVISIONS OF THE STANDARD ARE

TO BE APPLIED TO ALL NCIS PROSPECTIVELY, EXCEPT FOR THE PRESENTATION AND

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, WHICH ARE TO BE TO APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL

PERIODS PRESENTED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE FUTURE IMPACTS AND

DISCLOSURES OF THIS STANDARD.

IN DECEMBER 2007,

THE FASB RATIFIED THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE CONSENSUS ON EITF ISSUE NO. 07-1,

ACCOUNTING FOR COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS THAT DISCUSSES HOW PARTIES TO A

COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT (WHICH DOES NOT ESTABLISH A LEGAL ENTITY WITHIN SUCH

ARRANGEMENT) SHOULD ACCOUNT FOR VARIOUS ACTIVITIES. THE CONSENSUS INDICATES

THAT COSTS INCURRED AND REVENUES GENERATED FROM TRANSACTIONS WITH THIRD PARTIES

(I.E. PARTIES OUTSIDE OF THE COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT) SHOULD BE REPORTED BY

THE COLLABORATORS ON THE RESPECTIVE LINE ITEMS IN THEIR INCOME STATEMENTS

PURSUANT TO EITF ISSUE NO. 99-19, REPORTING REVENUE GROSS AS A PRINCIPAL

VERSUS NET AS AN AGENT.  ADDITIONALLY,

THE CONSENSUS PROVIDES THAT INCOME STATEMENT CHARACTERIZATION OF PAYMENTS

BETWEEN THE PARTICIPANTS IN A COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENT SHOULD BE BASED UPON

EXISTING AUTHORITATIVE PRONOUNCEMENTS; ANALOGY TO SUCH PRONOUNCEMENTS IF NOT

WITHIN THEIR SCOPE; OR A REASONABLE, RATIONAL, AND CONSISTENTLY APPLIED

ACCOUNTING POLICY ELECTION. EITF ISSUE NO. 07-1 IS EFFECTIVE FOR 3M BEGINNING

JANUARY 1, 2009 AND IS TO BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS

PRESENTED FOR COLLABORATIVE ARRANGEMENTS EXISTING AS OF THE DATE OF ADOPTION.

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACTS AND DISCLOSURES OF THIS

STANDARD, BUT WOULD NOT EXPECT EITF ISSUE NO. 07-1 TO HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

NOTE 2.  ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES

DIVESTITURES.

IN JANUARY 2007,

3M COMPLETED THE SALE OF ITS GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IN EUROPE

MEDA AB ACQUIRED 3MS PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IN

EUROPE FOR $817 MILLION IN 2007.

·

GRACEWAY PHARMACEUTICALS INC. ACQUIRED 3MS

PHARMACEUTICAL OPERATIONS IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND LATIN AMERICA FOR

·

IRONBRIDGE CAPITAL AND ARCHER CAPITAL ACQUIRED 3MS

PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS IN THE ASIA PACIFIC REGION, INCLUDING AUSTRALIA AND

SOUTH AFRICA FOR $349 MILLION IN 2006.

THE AGREEMENTS ARE

THE RESULT OF A REVIEW OF STRATEGIC OPTIONS FOR THE BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS AND ITS IMMUNE RESPONSE MODIFIER (IRM) PLATFORM THAT 3M ANNOUNCED IN APRIL 2006.

UNDER THE AGREEMENTS, THE PURCHASERS ACQUIRED REGIONAL MARKETING AND

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS FOR 3MS WELL-KNOWN BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS,

INCLUDING ALDARA, DIFFLAM, DUROMINE, TAMBOCOR, MAXAIR, METROGEL-VAGINAL AND

MINITRAN. AS PART OF THE TRANSACTION, GRACEWAY PHARMACEUTICALS ALSO ACQUIRED

THE RIGHTS TO CERTAIN IRM MOLECULES.

IN CONNECTION WITH

THESE TRANSACTIONS, 3M ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WHEREBY ITS DRUG DELIVERY

SYSTEMS DIVISION BECAME A SOURCE OF SUPPLY TO THE ACQUIRING COMPANIES. BECAUSE

OF THE EXTENT OF 3M CASH FLOWS FROM THESE AGREEMENTS IN RELATION TO THOSE OF

THE DISPOSED-OF BUSINESSES, THE OPERATIONS OF THE BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS ARE NOT CLASSIFIED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. SEE NOTE 4 FOR FURTHER

DISCUSSION OF RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS THAT RESULTED FROM THE DIVESTURE OF THE

COMPANYS GLOBAL BRANDED PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS.

EMPLOYEES, APPROXIMATELY 960 POSITIONS RELATED PRIMARILY TO CORPORATE STAFF

OVERHEAD REDUCTIONS, AND APPROXIMATELY 550 POSITIONS WERE BUSINESS-SPECIFIC

REDUCTION ACTIONS. OF THE 1,900 EMPLOYMENT REDUCTIONS, ABOUT 58% ARE IN THE

UNITED STATES, 21% IN EUROPE, 12% IN LATIN AMERICA AND CANADA, AND 9% IN THE

ASIA PACIFIC AREA. AS A RESULT OF THE SECOND-QUARTER 2007 PHASE-OUT OF

OPERATIONS AT A NEW JERSEY ROOFING GRANULE FACILITY AND THE SALE OF THE COMPANYS

OPTICOM PRIORITY

CONTROL SYSTEMS AND CANOGA TRAFFIC DETECTION

BUSINESSES,

THE COMPANY ELIMINATED APPROXIMATELY 100 ADDITIONAL POSITIONS.

EMPLOYEE-RELATED SEVERANCE CHARGES ARE LARGELY BASED UPON DISTRIBUTED

EMPLOYMENT POLICIES AND SUBSTANTIVE SEVERANCE PLANS AND WERE REFLECTED IN THE

QUARTER IN WHICH MANAGEMENT APPROVED THE RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS. SEVERANCE

AMOUNTS FOR WHICH AFFECTED EMPLOYEES WERE REQUIRED TO RENDER SERVICE IN ORDER

TO RECEIVE BENEFITS AT THEIR TERMINATION DATES WERE MEASURED AT THE DATE SUCH

BENEFITS WERE COMMUNICATED TO THE APPLICABLE EMPLOYEES AND RECOGNIZED AS

EXPENSE OVER THE EMPLOYEES REMAINING SERVICE PERIODS.

NON-CASH EMPLOYEE-RELATED CHANGES IN 2007 AND 2006 PRIMARILY RELATE TO

SPECIAL TERMINATION PENSION AND MEDICAL BENEFITS GRANTED TO CERTAIN U.S.

ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. THESE PENSION AND MEDICAL BENEFITS WERE REFLECTED AS A

COMPONENT OF THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF THE COMPANYS PENSION AND MEDICAL PLANS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006. IN ADDITION, THESE CHANGES ALSO REFLECT

NON-CASH STOCK OPTION EXPENSE DUE TO THE RECLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN EMPLOYEES

AGE 50 AND OLDER TO RETIREE STATUS, RESULTING IN A MODIFICATION OF THEIR

ORIGINAL STOCK OPTION AWARDS FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

CONTRACT TERMINATION AND OTHER CHARGES PRIMARILY REFLECT COSTS TO

TERMINATE A CONTRACT BEFORE THE END OF ITS TERM (MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE AT THE

TIME THE COMPANY PROVIDED NOTICE TO THE COUNTERPARTY) OR COSTS THAT WILL

CONTINUE TO BE INCURRED UNDER THE CONTRACT FOR ITS REMAINING TERM WITHOUT

ECONOMIC BENEFIT TO THE COMPANY.

BUSINESS-SPECIFIC ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR 2007 TOTALED $35

MILLION. THIS INCLUDED CHARGES OF $24 MILLION RELATED TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMPANYS DECISION TO PHASE-OUT OPERATIONS AT A

NEW JERSEY ROOFING GRANULE FACILITY (SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES

SEGMENT) AND CHARGES OF $11 MILLION ($10 MILLION RELATED TO PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT AND $1 MILLION RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS) RELATED TO THE COMPANYS

DECISION TO CLOSE AN ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS FACILITY IN WISCONSIN. ASSET

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT REFLECT THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS CARRYING VALUES OVER THEIR FAIR

VALUES.

ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN 2006 ASSOCIATED WITH THE PHARMACEUTICALS

BUSINESS AND BUSINESS-SPECIFIC ACTIONS INCLUDE $109 MILLION RELATIVE TO

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT; $30 MILLION RELATIVE TO INTANGIBLE ASSETS; AND

$5 MILLION RELATIVE TO OTHER ASSETS. IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATIVE TO INTANGIBLE

ASSETS AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT REFLECT THE EXCESS OF THE ASSETS

CARRYING VALUES OVER THEIR FAIR VALUES AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1. THE

PHARMACEUTICALS BUSINESS ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ARE FOR CERTAIN ASSETS NOT

TRANSFERRED TO THE BUYERS AND PRIMARILY RELATE TO THE WRITE-DOWN OF THE ASSETS

TO SALVAGE VALUE. THE BUSINESS-SPECIFIC ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES PRIMARILY

RELATE TO DECISIONS THE COMPANY MADE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006 TO EXIT

CERTAIN MARGINAL PRODUCT LINES IN THE DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS SEGMENT AND ELECTRO

AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT.

55

OTHER EXIT ACTIVITIES.

DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2007, THE COMPANY RECORDED NET PRE-TAX CHARGES

OF $45 MILLION RELATED TO EXIT ACTIVITIES. THESE CHARGES RELATED TO EMPLOYEE

REDUCTIONS AND FIXED ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, INCLUDING THE CONSOLIDATION OF CERTAIN

FLEXIBLE CIRCUIT MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS ($23 MILLION RECORDED IN THE ELECTRO

AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT) AND OTHER ACTIONS, PRIMARILY IN THE DISPLAY AND

GRAPHICS SEGMENT AND INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT. THESE CHARGES WERE

RECORDED IN COST OF SALES AND SELLING, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES AND

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED EXPENSES.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87,

88, 106 AND 132(R). THIS STANDARD ELIMINATED THE REQUIREMENT FOR A MINIMUM

PENSION LIABILITY ADJUSTMENT THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY REQUIRED UNDER SFAS NO. 87

AND REQUIRED EMPLOYERS TO RECOGNIZE THE UNDERFUNDED OR OVERFUNDED STATUS OF A

DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

POSITION. IN 2006, AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SFAS NO. 158, THE

COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN AFTER-TAX DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME OF $1.187 BILLION AND $513 MILLION FOR THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

PENSION BENEFIT PLANS, RESPECTIVELY, AND $218 MILLION FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT

HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PLAN. SEE NOTE 11 FOR ADDITIONAL DETAIL.

RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS ARE MADE TO AVOID DOUBLE COUNTING IN

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ITEMS THAT ARE ALSO RECORDED AS PART OF NET INCOME. IN

2007, A

S DISCLOSED IN

THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST TABLE IN NOTE 11, $198 MILLION PRE-TAX ($123

MILLION AFTER-TAX) WERE RECLASSIFIED TO EARNINGS FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE IN THE INCOME

STATEMENT. THESE PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE AMOUNTS ARE SHOWN IN THE

TABLE IN NOTE 11 AS AMORTIZATION OF TRANSITION (ASSET) OBLIGATION, AMORTIZATION

OF PRIOR SERVICE COST (BENEFIT) AND AMORTIZATION OF NET ACTUARIAL (GAIN) LOSS.

OTHER R

ECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS (EXCEPT

FOR CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ADJUSTMENTS PROVIDED IN NOTE 12) WERE NOT

MATERIAL. NO TAX PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR THE TRANSLATION OF FOREIGN

THE COMPANY FILES INCOME TAX

RETURNS IN THE U.S. FEDERAL JURISDICTION, AND VARIOUS STATES AND FOREIGN

JURISDICTIONS. WITH FEW EXCEPTIONS, THE COMPANY IS NO LONGER SUBJECT TO U.S.

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL, OR NON-U.S. INCOME TAX EXAMINATIONS BY TAX

AUTHORITIES FOR YEARS BEFORE 1999.

IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT ITS

EXAMINATION FOR THE COMPANYS U.S. INCOME TAX RETURNS FOR THE YEARS 2002

THROUGH 2004 WILL BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF FIRST QUARTER 2008. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2007, THE IRS HAS PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS TO THE COMPANYS TAX POSITIONS FOR WHICH

THE COMPANY IS FULLY RESERVED. PAYMENTS RELATING TO ANY PROPOSED ASSESSMENTS

ARISING FROM THE 2002 THROUGH 2004 AUDIT MAY NOT BE MADE UNTIL A FINAL

AGREEMENT IS REACHED BETWEEN THE COMPANY AND THE IRS ON SUCH ASSESSMENTS OR

UPON A FINAL RESOLUTION RESULTING FROM THE ADMINISTRATIVE APPEALS PROCESS OR

JUDICIAL ACTION. IN ADDITION TO THE U.S. FEDERAL EXAMINATION, THERE IS ALSO

LIMITED AUDIT ACTIVITY IN SEVERAL U.S. STATE AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS.

CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS TO

CHANGE BY AN INSIGNIFICANT AMOUNT DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

THE COMPANY ADOPTED THE

PROVISIONS OF FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48, ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES,

ON JANUARY 1, 2007. AS A RESULT OF THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF INTERPRETATION 48, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN IMMATERIAL

INCREASE IN THE LIABILITY FOR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS, WHICH WAS ACCOUNTED

FOR AS A REDUCTION TO THE JANUARY 1, 2007, BALANCE OF RETAINED EARNINGS. A

RECONCILIATION OF THE BEGINNING AND ENDING AMOUNT OF GROSS UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BENEFITS (UTB) IS AS FOLLOWS.

THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF

UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT THE EFFECTIVE TAX

RATE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007, RESPECTIVELY, ARE

$261 MILLION AND $334 MILLION. THE ENDING NET UTB RESULTS FROM ADJUSTING THE

GROSS BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 FOR ITEMS SUCH AS FEDERAL, STATE, AND

NON-U.S. DEFERRED ITEMS, INTEREST AND PENALTIES, AND DEDUCTIBLE TAXES. THE NET

UTB IS INCLUDED AS COMPONENTS OF ACCRUED INCOME TAXES AND OTHER LIABILITIES

WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES

INTEREST AND PENALTIES ACCRUED RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN TAX

EXPENSE. AT JANUARY 1, 2007 AND DECEMBER 31, 2007, ACCRUED INTEREST

AND PENALTIES ON A GROSS BASIS WERE $65 MILLION AND $69 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

INCLUDED IN THESE INTEREST AND PENALTY AMOUNTS IS INTEREST AND PENALTIES

RELATED TO TAX POSITIONS FOR WHICH THE ULTIMATE DEDUCTIBILITY IS HIGHLY CERTAIN

BUT FOR WHICH THERE IS UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE TIMING OF SUCH DEDUCTIBILITY. BECAUSE

OF THE IMPACT OF DEFERRED TAX ACCOUNTING, OTHER THAN INTEREST AND PENALTIES,

THE DISALLOWANCE OF THE SHORTER DEDUCTIBILITY PERIOD WOULD NOT AFFECT THE

ANNUAL EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BUT WOULD ACCELERATE THE PAYMENT OF CASH TO THE

TAXING AUTHORITY TO AN EARLIER PERIOD.

IN 2007, THE COMPANY

COMPLETED THE PREPARATION AND FILING OF ITS 2006 U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME

TAX RETURNS, WHICH DID NOT RESULT IN ANY MATERIAL CHANGES TO THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION. IN 2006, AN AUDIT OF THE COMPANYS U.S. TAX RETURNS FOR

YEARS THROUGH 2001 WAS COMPLETED. THE COMPANY AND THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE

REACHED A FINAL SETTLEMENT FOR THESE YEARS, INCLUDING AN AGREEMENT ON THE

AMOUNT OF A REFUND CLAIM TO BE FILED BY THE COMPANY. THE COMPANY ALSO

SUBSTANTIALLY RESOLVED AUDITS IN CERTAIN EUROPEAN COUNTRIES. IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY COMPLETED THE PREPARATION AND FILING OF ITS 2005 U.S. FEDERAL INCOME

TAX RETURN AND THE CORRESPONDING 2005 STATE INCOME TAX RETURNS. THE ADJUSTMENTS

FROM AMOUNTS PREVIOUSLY ESTIMATED IN THE U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE INCOME TAX

RETURNS (BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE) INCLUDED LOWER U.S. TAXES ON DIVIDENDS

RECEIVED FROM THE COMPANYS FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. THE COMPANY ALSO MADE

QUARTERLY ADJUSTMENTS (BOTH POSITIVE AND NEGATIVE) TO ITS RESERVES FOR TAX

CONTINGENCIES. CONSIDERING THE DEVELOPMENTS NOTED ABOVE AND OTHER FACTORS,

INCLUDING THE IMPACT ON OPEN AUDIT YEARS OF THE RECENT RESOLUTION OF ISSUES IN

VARIOUS AUDITS, THESE REASSESSMENTS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF THE RESERVES IN

2006 BY $149 MILLION, INCLUSIVE OF THE EXPECTED AMOUNT OF CERTAIN REFUND

CLAIMS.

IN 2005, THE

COMPANY ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT TO REINVEST $1.7 BILLION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS IN

THE UNITED STATES PURSUANT TO THE PROVISIONS OF THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT

OF 2004. THIS ACT PROVIDED THE COMPANY THE OPPORTUNITY TO TAX-

60

EFFICIENTLY

REPATRIATE FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR U.S. QUALIFYING INVESTMENTS SPECIFIED IN ITS

DOMESTIC REINVESTMENT PLAN. AS A CONSEQUENCE, IN 2005, 3M RECORDED A CHARGE OF

$75 MILLION.

THE COMPANY MADE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO ITS

U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN OF $200 MILLION IN 2007, $200 MILLION IN 2006, AND

$500 MILLION IN 2005.

THE CURRENT INCOME TAX PROVISION INCLUDES A BENEFIT FOR THE PENSION

CONTRIBUTIONS; THE DEFERRED TAX PROVISION INCLUDES A COST FOR THE RELATED

TEMPORARY DIFFERENCE.

AS A RESULT OF CERTAIN EMPLOYMENT COMMITMENTS

AND CAPITAL INVESTMENTS MADE BY 3M, INCOME FROM MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES IN

CERTAIN COUNTRIES IS SUBJECT TO REDUCED TAX RATES OR, IN SOME CASES, IS EXEMPT

FROM TAX FOR YEARS THROUGH 2014. THE INCOME TAX BENEFITS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

TAX STATUS OF THESE SUBSIDIARIES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $47 MILLION (6 CENTS PER

DILUTED SHARE) IN 2007, $20 MILLION (3 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2006,

AND $23 MILLION (3 CENTS PER DILUTED SHARE) IN 2005.

THE COMPANY HAS

NOT PROVIDED DEFERRED TAXES ON UNREMITTED EARNINGS ATTRIBUTABLE TO

INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES THAT HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED TO BE REINVESTED

INDEFINITELY. THESE EARNINGS RELATE TO ONGOING OPERATIONS AND WERE

APPROXIMATELY $5.7 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. BECAUSE OF THE

AVAILABILITY OF U.S. FOREIGN TAX CREDITS, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO DETERMINE

THE INCOME TAX LIABILITY THAT WOULD BE PAYABLE IF SUCH EARNINGS WERE NOT

INDEFINITELY REINVESTED.

CLASSIFICATION OF

MARKETABLE SECURITIES AS CURRENT OR NON-CURRENT IS DEPENDENT UPON MANAGEMENTS

INTENDED HOLDING PERIOD, THE SECURITYS MATURITY DATE AND LIQUIDITY

CONSIDERATIONS BASED ON MARKET CONDITIONS. IF MANAGEMENT INTENDS TO HOLD THE

SECURITIES FOR LONGER THAN ONE YEAR AS OF THE BALANCE SHEET DATE, THEY ARE

CLASSIFIED AS NON-CURRENT. THE FAIR VALUE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES APPROXIMATES

COST, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN AUCTION RATE SECURITIES DISCUSSED IN THE NEXT

PARAGRAPH. GROSS UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES FOR MARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE NOT

MATERIAL AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006; HOWEVER, IN 2007 THE COMPANY

DID HAVE BOTH REALIZED AND UNREALIZED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH AUCTION RATE

SECURITIES AS DISCUSSED BELOW. GROSS REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON SALES OF

MARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR 2007, 2006 OR 2005, BUT IN 2007

PRE-TAX GAINS TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $7 MILLION. COST OF SECURITIES SOLD OR

RECLASSIFIED USE THE FIRST IN, FIRST OUT (FIFO) METHOD. SINCE THESE MARKETABLE

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE WILL FLOW THROUGH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WITH AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED

OUT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME INTO EARNINGS UPON SALE OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT (AS DISCUSSED BELOW).

3M HAS A DIVERSIFIED

MARKETABLE SECURITIES PORTFOLIO OF $1.059 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007.

WITHIN THIS PORTFOLIO, CURRENT AND LONG-TERM ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES (ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE OF $453 MILLION) ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF INTERESTS IN AUTOMOBILE

LOANS AND CREDIT CARDS, WITH ONLY $27 MILLION INVESTED IN INTERESTS IN

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES OR HOME EQUITY LOANS. 3MS MARKETABLE SECURITIES

PORTFOLIO ALSO INCLUDES AUCTION RATE SECURITIES (ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $16

MILLION) THAT REPRESENT INTERESTS IN COLLATERALIZED DEBT OBLIGATIONS, WHICH ARE

COLLATERALIZED BY POOLS OF RESIDENTIAL AND COMMERCIAL MORTGAGES, AND INTERESTS

IN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS. DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2007, THESE

AUCTION RATE SECURITIES FAILED TO AUCTION DUE TO SELL ORDERS EXCEEDING BUY

ORDERS. LIQUIDITY FOR THESE AUCTION-RATE SECURITIES IS TYPICALLY PROVIDED BY AN

AUCTION PROCESS THAT RESETS THE APPLICABLE INTEREST RATE AT PRE-DETERMINED

INTERVALS,

61

USUALLY EVERY 7, 28, 35,

OR 90 DAYS. THE FUNDS ASSOCIATED WITH FAILED AUCTIONS WILL NOT BE ACCESSIBLE

UNTIL A SUCCESSFUL AUCTION OCCURS OR A BUYER IS FOUND OUTSIDE OF THE AUCTION

PROCESS. BASED ON BROKER-DEALER VALUATION MODELS AND AN ANALYSIS OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT FACTORS, AUCTION RATE SECURITIES WITH AN

ORIGINAL PAR VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $34 MILLION WERE WRITTEN-DOWN TO AN

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $16 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. THIS

WRITE-DOWN RESULTED IN AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $10 MILLION (PRE-TAX) REFLECTED AS AN UNREALIZED LOSS

WITHIN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME FOR 2007. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THESE

INVESTMENTS IN AUCTION RATE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN IN A LOSS POSITION FOR LESS

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY-IMPAIRMENT AND ITS APPLICATION TO CERTAIN INVESTMENTS,

TO DETERMINE THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE IMPAIRMENT AS TEMPORARY

OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. A TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RESULTS IN AN

UNREALIZED LOSS BEING RECORDED IN THE OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME COMPONENT OF

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. SUCH AN UNREALIZED LOSS DOES NOT REDUCE NET INCOME FOR

THE APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING PERIOD BECAUSE THE LOSS IS NOT VIEWED AS

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT A PORTION OF THE IMPAIRMENT OF

ITS AUCTION RATE SECURITIES INVESTMENTS IS TEMPORARY AND A PORTION IS

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. THE FACTORS EVALUATED TO DIFFERENTIATE BETWEEN TEMPORARY

AND OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY INCLUDE THE PROJECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS, CREDIT

RATINGS ACTIONS, AND ASSESSMENT OF THE CREDIT QUALITY OF THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL.

LONG-TERM DEBT PAYMENTS

DUE IN 2008 INCLUDE $350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES (FINAL

MATURITY 2010) AND $62 MILLION OF FLOATING RATE NOTES (FINAL MATURITY 2044).

THESE SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT AS THE

RESULT OF PUT PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE DEBT INSTRUMENTS.

THE

ESOP DEBT IS SERVICED BY DIVIDENDS ON STOCK HELD BY THE ESOP AND BY COMPANY

CONTRIBUTIONS. THESE CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT REPORTED AS INTEREST EXPENSE, BUT

ARE REPORTED AS AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF

INCOME. OTHER BORROWINGS INCLUDES DEBT HELD BY 3MS INTERNATIONAL COMPANIES AND

FLOATING

RATE

NOTES IN THE UNITED STATES, WITH THE LONG-TERM PORTION OF THIS DEBT PRIMARILY

COMPOSED OF U.S. DOLLAR FLOATING RATE DEBT.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, CERTAIN DEBT AGREEMENTS

($350 MILLION OF DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES AND $87 MILLION OF ESOP

DEBT) HAD RATINGS TRIGGERS (BBB-/BAA3 OR LOWER) THAT WOULD REQUIRE REPAYMENT OF

DEBT. THE COMPANY HAS AN AA CREDIT RATING FROM STANDARD & POORS, WITH

A STABLE OUTLOOK, AND AN AA1 CREDIT RATING FROM MOODYS INVESTORS SERVICE, WITH

A NEGATIVE OUTLOOK. ON APRIL 30, 2007, THE COMPANY REPLACED ITS $565

MILLION CREDIT FACILITY WITH A NEW $1.5 BILLION FIVE-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY,

WHICH HAS PROVISIONS FOR THE COMPANY TO REQUEST AN INCREASE OF THE FACILITY UP

TO $2 BILLION (AT THE LENDERS DISCRETION), AND PROVIDING FOR UP TO $150 MILLION

IN LETTERS OF CREDIT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THERE ARE $110 MILLION IN

LETTERS OF CREDIT DRAWN AGAINST THE FACILITY. UNDER THE NEW CREDIT AGREEMENT,

3M IS REQUIRED TO MAINTAIN ITS EBITDA TO INTEREST RATIO AS OF THE END OF EACH

FISCAL QUARTER AT NOT LESS THAN 3.0 TO 1. THIS IS CALCULATED (AS DEFINED IN THE

AGREEMENT) AS THE RATIO OF CONSOLIDATED TOTAL EBITDA FOR THE FOUR CONSECUTIVE

QUARTERS THEN ENDED TO TOTAL INTEREST EXPENSE ON ALL FUNDED DEBT FOR THE SAME

PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THIS RATIO WAS APPROXIMATELY 35 TO 1. AT DECEMBER 31,

2007, AVAILABLE SHORT-TERM COMMITTED LINES OF CREDIT INTERNATIONALLY TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $67 MILLION, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $13 MILLION WAS UTILIZED.

DEBT COVENANTS DO NOT RESTRICT THE PAYMENT OF DIVIDENDS.

THE COMPANY HAS A WELL-KNOWN SEASONED ISSUER SHELF

REGISTRATION STATEMENT, EFFECTIVE FEBRUARY 24, 2006, TO REGISTER AN

INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF DEBT OR EQUITY SECURITIES FOR FUTURE SALES. ON JUNE 15,

2007, THE COMPANY REGISTERED 150,718 SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON STOCK UNDER

THIS SHELF ON BEHALF OF AND FOR THE SOLE BENEFIT OF THE SELLING STOCKHOLDERS IN

CONNECTION WITH THE COMPANYS ACQUISITION OF ASSETS OF DIAMOND PRODUCTIONS, INC.

THE COMPANY INTENDS TO USE THE PROCEEDS FROM FUTURE SECURITIES SALES OFF THIS

SHELF FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES. IN CONNECTION WITH THIS SHELF

REGISTRATION, IN JUNE 2007 THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A MEDIUM-TERM NOTES

PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH UP TO $3 BILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MAY BE OFFERED. IN DECEMBER 2007,

3M ISSUED A FIVE-YEAR, $500 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE WITH A COUPON RATE OF

4.65% UNDER THIS MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM. THIS PROGRAM HAS A REMAINING

CAPACITY OF $2.5 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007.

IN SEPTEMBER 2003, THE COMPANY FILED A SHELF

REGISTRATION STATEMENT WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION RELATING TO

THE POTENTIAL OFFERING OF DEBT SECURITIES OF UP TO $1.5 BILLION. THIS SHELF

REGISTRATION BECAME EFFECTIVE IN OCTOBER 2003. IN DECEMBER 2003, THE

COMPANY ESTABLISHED UNDER THE SHELF A MEDIUM-TERM NOTES PROGRAM THROUGH WHICH

UP TO $1.5 BILLION OF MEDIUM-TERM NOTES MAY BE OFFERED. IN MARCH 2007, THE

COMPANY ISSUED A 30-YEAR, $750 MILLION, FIXED RATE NOTE WITH A COUPON RATE OF

5.70%. IN NOVEMBER 2006, 3M ISSUED A THREE-YEAR, $400 MILLION, FIXED RATE

NOTE. THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO AN INTEREST RATE SWAP TO CONVERT THIS TO A RATE

BASED ON A FLOATING LIBOR INDEX. IN DECEMBER 2004, 3M ISSUED A 40-YEAR,

$62 MILLION, FLOATING RATE NOTE, WITH THE RATE BASED ON A FLOATING LIBOR INDEX.

THIS $1.5 BILLION MEDIUM TERM NOTES PROGRAM WAS REPLACED BY THE $3 BILLION

PROGRAM ESTABLISHED IN JUNE 2007.

IN JULY 2007, 3M

ISSUED A SEVEN YEAR 5.0% FIXED RATE EUROBOND FOR AN AMOUNT OF 750 MILLION EUROS

(APPROXIMATELY $1.102 BILLION IN U.S. DOLLARS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007). UPON

DEBT ISSUANCE IN JULY 2007, 3M COMPLETED A FIXED-TO-FLOATING INTEREST RATE

SWAP ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 400 MILLION EUROS AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE OF A

PORTION OF THE FIXED INTEREST RATE EUROBOND OBLIGATION. IN DECEMBER 2007,

3M REOPENED THE EXISTING SEVEN YEAR 5.0% FIXED RATE EUROBOND FOR AN ADDITIONAL

AMOUNT OF 275 MILLION EUROS (APPROXIMATELY $404 MILLION IN U.S. DOLLARS AT DECEMBER 31,

2007). THIS SECURITY WAS ISSUED AT A PREMIUM AND WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CONSOLIDATED

WITH THE ORIGINAL SECURITY ON JANUARY 15, 2008.

3M

MAY REDEEM ITS 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES (THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES) AT

ANY TIME IN WHOLE OR IN PART, BEGINNING NOVEMBER 21, 2007, AT THE ACCRETED

CONVERSION PRICE; HOWEVER, BONDHOLDERS MAY CONVERT UPON NOTIFICATION OF

REDEMPTION EACH OF THE NOTES INTO 9.4602 SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK. HOLDERS OF

THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES HAVE THE OPTION TO REQUIRE 3M TO PURCHASE

THEIR NOTES AT ACCRETED VALUE ON NOVEMBER 21 IN THE YEARS 2005, 2007,

2012, 2017, 2022 AND 2027. IN NOVEMBER 2005, 22,506 OF THE 639,000 IN

OUTSTANDING BONDS WERE REDEEMED, RESULTING IN A PAYOUT FROM 3M OF APPROXIMATELY

$20 MILLION. IN NOVEMBER 2007, AN ADDITIONAL 364,598 OUTSTANDING BONDS

WERE REDEEMED RESULTING IN A PAYOUT FROM 3M OF APPROXIMATELY $322 MILLION.

THESE PAYOUTS REDUCED THE CONVERTIBLE NOTES FACE VALUE AT MATURITY TO $252

MILLION, WHICH EQUATES TO A BOOK VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $222 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2007. AS DISCLOSED IN A FORM 8-K IN NOVEMBER 2005, 3M AMENDED THE

TERMS OF THESE SECURITIES TO PAY CASH AT A RATE OF 2.40% PER ANNUM OF THE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT AT MATURITY OF THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES, WHICH EQUATES

TO 2.75% PER ANNUM OF THE NOTES ACCRETED VALUE ON NOVEMBER 21, 2005. THE

CASH INTEREST PAYMENTS WERE MADE SEMIANNUALLY IN ARREARS ON MAY 22, 2006, NOVEMBER 22,

2006, MAY 22, 2007 AND NOVEMBER 22, 2007 TO HOLDERS OF RECORD ON THE

15TH CALENDAR DAY PRECEDING EACH SUCH INTEREST PAYMENT DATE. EFFECTIVE NOVEMBER 22,

2007, THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATE REVERTED BACK TO THE ORIGINAL YIELD OF 0.50%.

3M

ORIGINALLY SOLD $639 MILLION IN AGGREGATE FACE AMOUNT OF THESE CONVERTIBLE

NOTES ON NOVEMBER 15, 2002, WHICH ARE CONVERTIBLE INTO SHARES OF 3M

COMMON STOCK. THE GROSS PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING, TO BE USED FOR GENERAL

CORPORATE PURPOSES, WERE $550 MILLION ($540 MILLION NET OF ISSUANCE COSTS).

DEBT ISSUANCE COSTS WERE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER A THREE-YEAR

PERIOD BEGINNING IN NOVEMBER 2002. ON FEBRUARY 14, 2003, 3M

REGISTERED THESE CONVERTIBLE NOTES IN A REGISTRATION STATEMENT FILED WITH THE

SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION. THE TERMS OF THE

64

CONVERTIBLE

NOTES INCLUDE A YIELD TO MATURITY OF .50% AND AN INITIAL CONVERSION PREMIUM OF

40% OVER THE $65.00 (SPLIT-ADJUSTED) CLOSING PRICE OF 3M COMMON STOCK ON NOVEMBER 14,

2002. IF CERTAIN CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION (RELATING TO THE CLOSING COMMON

STOCK PRICES OF 3M EXCEEDING THE CONVERSION TRIGGER PRICE FOR SPECIFIED

PERIODS) ARE MET, HOLDERS MAY CONVERT EACH OF THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR

NOTES INTO 9.4602 SHARES OF 3M COMMON STOCK IN ANY CALENDAR QUARTER COMMENCING

AFTER MARCH 31, 2003. THE CONVERSION TRIGGER PRICE FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2007 WAS $121.21 PER SHARE. IF THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, AND 3M

ELECTS NOT TO SETTLE IN CASH, THE 30-YEAR ZERO-COUPON SENIOR NOTES WILL BE

CONVERTIBLE IN THE AGGREGATE INTO APPROXIMATELY 2.4 MILLION SHARES OF 3M COMMON

STOCK. THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION RELATED TO THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE NOTES

HAVE NEVER BEEN MET. IF THE CONDITIONS FOR CONVERSION ARE MET, 3M MAY CHOOSE TO

PAY IN CASH AND/OR COMMON STOCK; HOWEVER, IF THIS OCCURS, THE COMPANY HAS THE

INTENT AND ABILITY TO SETTLE THIS DEBT SECURITY IN CASH. ACCORDINGLY, THERE WAS

NO IMPACT ON 3MS DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE COMPANYS $350 MILLION OF

DEALER REMARKETABLE SECURITIES WERE REMARKETED FOR ONE YEAR. THEY WERE REISSUED

WITH A FIXED COUPON RATE OF 5.83%. THESE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE CLASSIFIED

AS CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, WERE ISSUED IN DECEMBER 2000. THE

REMARKETABLE SECURITIES CAN BE REMARKETED ANNUALLY, AT THE OPTION OF THE

DEALER, FOR A YEAR EACH TIME, WITH A FINAL MATURITY DATE OF DECEMBER 2010.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007, 3M REPURCHASED $42 MILLION IN FLOATING RATE

NOTES DUE IN 2037 AT PAR AS THE BONDHOLDER EXERCISED PUT PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED

WITH THIS DEBT INSTRUMENT.

NOTE

11.  PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT

PLANS

3M

HAS VARIOUS COMPANY-SPONSORED RETIREMENT PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL U.S.

EMPLOYEES AND MANY EMPLOYEES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. PENSION BENEFITS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE PLANS GENERALLY ARE BASED ON EACH PARTICIPANTS YEARS OF

SERVICE, COMPENSATION, AND AGE AT RETIREMENT OR TERMINATION. IN ADDITION TO

PROVIDING PENSION BENEFITS, THE COMPANY PROVIDES CERTAIN POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH

CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS U.S. EMPLOYEES

WHO REACH RETIREMENT AGE WHILE EMPLOYED BY THE COMPANY. MOST INTERNATIONAL

EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES ARE COVERED BY GOVERNMENT HEALTH CARE PROGRAMS. THE COST

OF COMPANY-PROVIDED POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE PLANS FOR INTERNATIONAL

EMPLOYEES IS NOT MATERIAL AND IS COMBINED WITH U.S. AMOUNTS.

THE

COMPANYS PENSION FUNDING POLICY IS TO DEPOSIT WITH INDEPENDENT TRUSTEES

AMOUNTS ALLOWABLE BY LAW. TRUST FUNDS AND DEPOSITS WITH INSURANCE COMPANIES ARE

MAINTAINED TO PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS TO PLAN PARTICIPANTS AND THEIR

BENEFICIARIES. THERE ARE NO PLAN ASSETS IN THE NON-QUALIFIED PLAN DUE TO ITS

NATURE. FOR ITS U.S. POSTRETIREMENT HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT

PLANS, THE COMPANY HAS SET ASIDE AMOUNTS AT LEAST EQUAL TO ANNUAL BENEFIT

PAYMENTS WITH AN INDEPENDENT TRUSTEE.

IN

AUGUST 2006, THE PENSION PROTECTION ACT (PPA) WAS SIGNED INTO LAW IN THE

U.S. THE PPA INCREASES THE FUNDING TARGET FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS TO

100% OF THE TARGET LIABILITY. THE PPA TRANSITION RULES REQUIRE A FUNDING

LIABILITY TARGET OF 92% IN 2008, REACHING 100% BY 2011. 3MS U.S. QUALIFIED

DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS ARE FUNDED IN EXCESS OF THE APPLICABLE TRANSITION FUNDING

LIABILITY TARGET FOR 2008; THEREFORE, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE PLANS WILL

NOT BE SUBJECT TO THE MINIMUM REQUIRED CONTRIBUTION OF THE PPA AND ITS

TRANSITION RULES WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON EXPECTED FUTURE

CONTRIBUTIONS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 158, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87,

88, 106 AND 132(R). THIS STANDARD REQUIRES EMPLOYERS TO RECOGNIZE THE

UNDERFUNDED OR OVERFUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

PLANS AS AN ASSET OR LIABILITY IN ITS STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION, AND

RECOGNIZE CHANGES IN THE FUNDED STATUS IN THE YEAR IN WHICH THE CHANGES OCCUR

THROUGH ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WHICH IS A COMPONENT OF

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. THIS STANDARD ALSO ELIMINATES THE REQUIREMENT FOR

ADDITIONAL MINIMUM PENSION LIABILITY (AML) REQUIRED UNDER SFAS NO. 87. AS

A RESULT OF THE APPLICATION OF SFAS NO. 158 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006,

3M REVERSED ASSETS OF $2.515 BILLION AND INCREASED LIABILITIES BY $703

MILLION. THESE LIABILITIES WERE OFFSET TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME AND DEFERRED TAXES. IN 2006, AS A RESULT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF SFAS NO. 158,

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED AN AFTER-TAX DECREASE IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME OF $1.187 BILLION AND $513 MILLION FOR THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL

PENSION BENEFIT PLANS, RESPECTIVELY, AND $218 MILLION FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT

HEALTH CARE AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFIT PLAN.

THE COMPANY CONVERTED TO THE RP (RETIREMENT PLANS) 2000 MORTALITY TABLE FOR

CALCULATING THE YEAR-END 2005 U.S. PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS AND

2006 EXPENSE. THE IMPACT OF THIS CHANGE INCREASED THE YEAR-END 2005 U.S.

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR PENSION BY $385 MILLION, THE YEAR-END 2005

U.S. ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS FOR PENSION BY $349 MILLION AND THE 2005

U.S. ACCUMULATED POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION BY $93 MILLION. THIS CHANGE

ALSO INCREASED PENSION EXPENSES FOR 2006 BY $64 MILLION AND POSTRETIREMENT

EXPENSES BY $17 MILLION.

THE COMPANY REVIEWS

EXTERNAL DATA AND ITS OWN HISTORICAL TRENDS FOR HEALTH CARE COSTS TO DETERMINE

THE HEALTH CARE TREND RATES FOR THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL PLANS. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2006, THE COMPANY MODIFIED ITS HEALTH CARE TREND RATES ASSUMPTION BY RAISING

THE RATE AND SEPARATING THE TREND RATES USED FOR PLAN PARTICIPANTS LESS THAN 65

YEARS OF AGE AND PLAN PARTICIPANTS 65 YEARS OF AGE OR OLDER. THE SEPARATION OF

THE TREND RATES REFLECTS THE HIGHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH PRESCRIPTION DRUGS IN

THE 65 OR OLDER AGE GROUP. THE ASSUMED HEALTH CARE TREND RATES AS OF DECEMBER 31

ARE AS FOLLOWS.

3MS

INVESTMENT STRATEGY FOR ITS PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IS TO MANAGE THE

PLANS ON A GOING-CONCERN BASIS. THE PRIMARY GOAL OF THE FUNDS IS TO MEET THE

OBLIGATIONS AS REQUIRED. THE SECONDARY GOAL IS TO EARN THE HIGHEST RATE OF

RETURN POSSIBLE, WITHOUT JEOPARDIZING ITS PRIMARY GOAL, AND WITHOUT SUBJECTING

THE COMPANY TO AN UNDUE AMOUNT OF CONTRIBUTION RATE VOLATILITY. FUND RETURNS

ARE USED TO HELP FINANCE PRESENT AND FUTURE OBLIGATIONS TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE

WITHIN ACTUARIALLY DETERMINED FUNDING LIMITS AND TAX-DETERMINED ASSET LIMITS,

THUS REDUCING THE LEVEL OF CONTRIBUTIONS 3M MUST MAKE.

3M

DOES NOT BUY OR SELL ANY OF ITS OWN STOCK AS A DIRECT INVESTMENT FOR ITS

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT FUNDS. HOWEVER, DUE TO EXTERNAL

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT OF THE FUNDS, THE PLANS MAY INDIRECTLY BUY, SELL OR HOLD

3M STOCK. THE AGGREGATE AMOUNT OF THE SHARES WOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED TO BE

MATERIAL RELATIVE TO THE AGGREGATE FUND PERCENTAGES.

FOR THE U.S. PENSION

PLAN, THE COMPANYS ASSUMPTION FOR THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS WAS 8.75%

IN 2007. THE COMPANY IS LOWERING THE 2008 EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS FOR

ITS U.S. PENSION PLAN BY 0.25 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 8.50%. THIS WILL REDUCE 2008

EXPECTED PENSION INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $26 MILLION. PROJECTED RETURNS ARE

BASED PRIMARILY ON BROAD, PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY AND FIXED-INCOME INDICES AND

FORWARD-LOOKING ESTIMATES OF ACTIVE PORTFOLIO AND INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANYS 2008 EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON U.S.

PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON AN ASSET ALLOCATION ASSUMPTION OF 46% GLOBAL EQUITIES,

WITH AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF 7.75%, 13% PRIVATE EQUITIES WITH

AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF 12.75%; 24% FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES

WITH AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN OF 5.0%; 12% ABSOLUTE RETURN

INVESTMENTS INDEPENDENT OF TRADITIONAL PERFORMANCE BENCHMARKS, WITH AN EXPECTED

LONG TERM RETURN OF 7%, 5% COMMODITIES WITH AN EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF

RETURN OF 6.5%. THE COMPANY EXPECTS ADDITIONAL POSITIVE RETURN FROM ACTIVE

INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT. THESE ASSUMPTIONS RESULT IN AN 8.50% EXPECTED RATE OF

RETURN ON AN ANNUALIZED BASIS. THE PLAN ASSETS EARNED A RATE OF RETURN IN

EXCESS OF 14%, 12% AND 10% IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. THE AVERAGE

ANNUAL ACTUAL RETURN ON THE PLAN ASSETS OVER THE PAST 10 AND 25 YEARS HAS BEEN

9.1% AND 12.2%, RESPECTIVELY.

DURING

2006, CERTAIN ABSOLUTE RETURN AND COMMODITY INVESTMENTS WERE INCLUDED IN EQUITY

AND FIXED INCOME ALLOCATIONS. THE 2006 PRESENTATION IN THE TABLE THAT FOLLOWS

HAS BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE 2007 PRESENTATION.

IN

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007, THE COMPANY MADE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS

TOTALING $200 MILLION TO ITS U.S. QUALIFIED PENSION PLAN. IN 2008, THE COMPANY

EXPECTS TO CONTRIBUTE AN AMOUNT IN THE RANGE OF $100 MILLION TO $400 MILLION TO

ITS U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PENSION PLANS. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A REQUIRED

MINIMUM PENSION CONTRIBUTION OBLIGATION FOR ITS U.S. PLANS IN 2008. THEREFORE,

THE AMOUNT OF THE ANTICIPATED DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION COULD VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE U.S. PLANS FUNDING STATUS AS OF THE 2008

MEASUREMENT DATE AND THE ANTICIPATED TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE CONTRIBUTION.

NOTE 12.  DERIVATIVES AND OTHER

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY

SWAPS, AND FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO MANAGE RISKS GENERALLY ASSOCIATED

WITH FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATE, INTEREST RATE AND COMMODITY PRICE FLUCTUATIONS. THE

INFORMATION THAT FOLLOWS EXPLAINS THE VARIOUS TYPES OF DERIVATIVES AND

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, AND INCLUDES A TABLE THAT RECAPS CASH FLOW HEDGING

AMOUNTS.

CASH FLOW HEDGING  FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS.

THE COMPANY ENTERS

INTO FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS, OPTIONS AND SWAPS TO HEDGE AGAINST THE

EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS ON CASH FLOWS DENOMINATED IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES AND CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THESE TRANSACTIONS

ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD

VARIOUS OPEN FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS, THE MAJORITY OF

WHICH HAD MATURITIES OF ONE YEAR OR LESS. THE SETTLEMENT OR EXTENSION OF THESE

DERIVATIVES WILL RESULT IN RECLASSIFICATIONS TO EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD DURING

WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTIONS AFFECT EARNINGS (FROM OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME). THE MAXIMUM LENGTH OF TIME OVER WHICH 3M IS HEDGING ITS EXPOSURE TO

THE VARIABILITY IN FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR A MAJORITY OF THE FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS IS 12 MONTHS. HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL FOR THE YEARS

2007, 2006 AND 2005.

CASH FLOW HEDGING  COMMODITY

PRICE MANAGEMENT.

THE COMPANY MANAGES COMMODITY PRICE RISKS THROUGH

NEGOTIATED SUPPLY CONTRACTS, PRICE PROTECTION AGREEMENTS AND FORWARD PHYSICAL

CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY USES COMMODITY PRICE SWAPS AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS TO MANAGE PRICE VOLATILITY. THE RELATED MARK-TO-MARKET

GAIN OR LOSS ON QUALIFYING HEDGES IS INCLUDED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME TO

THE EXTENT EFFECTIVE, AND RECLASSIFIED INTO COST OF SALES IN THE PERIOD DURING

WHICH THE HEDGED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. 3M HAS HEDGED ITS EXPOSURE TO

THE VARIABILITY OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS FOR CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS

THROUGH 2008. NO SIGNIFICANT COMMODITY CASH FLOW HEDGES WERE DISCONTINUED AND

HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS WAS NOT MATERIAL DURING THE YEARS 2007, 2006 AND 2005.

CASH FLOW HEDGING  FORECASTED

DEBT ISSUANCE.

IN JUNE 2007, THE COMPANY EXECUTED A

PRE-ISSUANCE CASH FLOW HEDGE BY ENTERING INTO A FLOATING-TO-FIXED INTEREST RATE

SWAP ON A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 350 MILLION EUROS RELATED TO THE ANTICIPATED JULY 2007

EUROBOND ISSUANCE OF 750 MILLION EUROS. UPON DEBT ISSUANCE IN JULY 2007,

3M TERMINATED THE FLOATING-TO-FIXED SWAP. THE TERMINATION OF THE SWAP RESULTED

IN AN IMMATERIAL GAIN, WHICH IS BEING AMORTIZED OVER THE SEVEN YEAR LIFE OF THE

EUROBOND.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECLASSIFY TO EARNINGS

OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS A MAJORITY OF THE CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS

AFTER-TAX LOSS OF

$28 MILLION (WITH THE IMPACT OFFSET BY CASH FLOWS

FROM UNDERLYING HEDGED ITEMS).

FAIR VALUE HEDGING  INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

THE COMPANY MANAGES

INTEREST EXPENSE USING A MIX OF FIXED AND FLOATING RATE DEBT. TO HELP MANAGE

BORROWING COSTS, THE COMPANY MAY ENTER INTO INTEREST RATE SWAPS. UNDER THESE

ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY AGREES TO EXCHANGE, AT SPECIFIED INTERVALS, THE DIFFERENCE

BETWEEN FIXED AND FLOATING INTEREST AMOUNTS CALCULATED BY REFERENCE TO AN

AGREED-UPON NOTIONAL PRINCIPAL AMOUNT.

AT DECEMBER 31,

2007, THE COMPANY HAD INTEREST RATE SWAPS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF

UNDERLYING FIXED RATE OBLIGATIONS. IN JUNE 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO

A $330 MILLION FIXED-TO-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAP TO HEDGE THE 30-YEAR BOND

DUE IN 2028. THE COMPANY TERMINATED THE SWAP IN MARCH 2007 AND THE

RESULTING GAIN WILL BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE UNDERLYING

DEBT. ACCORDINGLY, THE TERMINATION OF THE SWAP DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON 3MS CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION. AS INDICATED

IN NOTE 10, IN NOVEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A $400 MILLION

FIXED-TO-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAP CONCURRENT WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE

THREE-YEAR MEDIUM-TERM NOTE DUE IN 2009.

ALSO AS INDICATED IN NOTE 10, IN JULY 2007, IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF A SEVEN-YEAR EUROBOND FOR AN AMOUNT OF 750

MILLION EUROS, THE COMPANY COMPLETED A FIXED-TO-FLOATING INTEREST RATE SWAP ON

A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF 400 MILLION EUROS AS A FAIR VALUE HEDGE OF A PORTION OF

THE FIXED INTEREST RATE EUROBOND OBLIGATION.

THE

MARK-TO-MARKET OF THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES IS RECORDED AS GAINS OR LOSSES IN

INTEREST EXPENSE AND IS OFFSET BY THE GAIN OR LOSS ON THE UNDERLYING DEBT

INSTRUMENT, WHICH ALSO IS RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE

INTEREST RATE SWAPS WERE $36 MILLION AND $26 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2007 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY. THESE FAIR VALUE HEDGES ARE 100% EFFECTIVE AND,

THUS, THERE IS NO IMPACT ON EARNINGS DUE TO HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS.

NET

INVESTMENT HEDGING.

AS CIRCUMSTANCES WARRANT, THE COMPANY USES CROSS

CURRENCY SWAPS, FORWARDS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY DENOMINATED DEBT TO HEDGE

PORTIONS OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENTS IN FOREIGN OPERATIONS. FOR HEDGES

THAT MEET THE EFFECTIVENESS REQUIREMENTS, THE NET GAINS OR LOSSES ATTRIBUTABLE

TO CHANGES IN SPOT EXCHANGE RATES ARE RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION WITHIN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE REMAINDER OF THE CHANGE IN VALUE OF SUCH

INSTRUMENTS IS RECORDED IN EARNINGS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR

FLOATING-TO-FLOATING CROSS CURRENCY SWAP WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $300

MILLION. THIS TRANSACTION IS A PARTIAL HEDGE OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN

ITS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THIS SWAP CONVERTS U.S. DOLLAR-BASED VARIABLE

INTEREST PAYMENTS TO YEN-BASED VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

NOTIONAL AMOUNT.

IN NOVEMBER 2006,

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO A THREE-YEAR

FLOATING-TO-FLOATING

CROSS

CURRENCY SWAP WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $200 MILLION. THIS

TRANSACTION IS A PARTIAL HEDGE OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS EUROPEAN

SUBSIDIARIES. THIS SWAP CONVERTS

U.S.

DOLLAR-BASED VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS

TO EURO-

BASED VARIABLE INTEREST PAYMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT.

IN DECEMBER 2006,

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH A NOTIONAL

AMOUNT OF $556 MILLION RELATIVE TO THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS

EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES AND WITH A NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF $209 MILLION RELATIVE

TO THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS JAPANESE SUBSIDIARIES. THESE FORWARDS

MATURED IN DECEMBER 2007.

IN JULY AND DECEMBER 2007,

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 10, THE COMPANY ISSUED SEVEN-YEAR FIXED RATE EUROBOND

SECURITIES FOR AMOUNTS OF 750 MILLION EUROS AND 275 MILLION EUROS,

RESPECTIVELY. 3M DESIGNATED EACH OF THESE EUROBOND ISSUANCES AS HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS EUROPEAN SUBSIDIARIES.

IN NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER 2007,

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WITH A NOTIONAL

AMOUNT OF $200 MILLION THAT WERE

DESIGNATED AS A PARTIAL HEDGE OF THE COMPANYS NET INVESTMENT IN ITS

CHINESE SUBSIDIARIES. THESE FORWARDS MATURE IN DECEMBER 2008.

THE

UNREALIZED LOSS RECORDED IN CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION RELATED TO NET INVESTMENT

HEDGING AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 WAS $28 MILLION

AND THE UNREALIZED LOSS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 WAS $18 MILLION.

CURRENCY EFFECTS.

3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR CURRENCY EFFECTS,

INCLUDING HEDGING IMPACTS, INCREASED NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $150 MILLION

IN 2007, $20 MILLION IN 2006, AND $115 MILLION IN 2005. THIS ESTIMATE INCLUDES

THE EFFECT OF TRANSLATING PROFITS FROM LOCAL CURRENCIES INTO U.S. DOLLARS; THE

IMPACT OF CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS ON THE TRANSFER OF GOODS BETWEEN 3M OPERATIONS

IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD; AND TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES, INCLUDING

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNED TO REDUCE FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISKS.

3M ESTIMATES THAT YEAR-ON-YEAR DERIVATIVE AND OTHER TRANSACTION GAINS AND LOSSES

INCREASED NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $10 MILLION IN 2007, HAD AN IMMATERIAL

IMPACT ON NET INCOME IN 2006, AND INCREASED NET INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $50

MILLION IN 2005.

72

CREDIT RISK.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED

TO CREDIT LOSS IN THE EVENT OF NONPERFORMANCE BY COUNTERPARTIES IN INTEREST

RATE SWAPS, CURRENCY SWAPS, AND OPTION AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS. HOWEVER,

THE COMPANYS RISK IS LIMITED TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE INSTRUMENTS. THE COMPANY

ACTIVELY MONITORS ITS EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK THROUGH THE USE OF CREDIT

APPROVALS AND CREDIT LIMITS, AND BY SELECTING MAJOR INTERNATIONAL BANKS AND

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS AS COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT ANTICIPATE

NONPERFORMANCE BY ANY OF THESE COUNTERPARTIES.

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006, THE COMPANY

ENTERED INTO A CREDIT SUPPORT AGREEMENT WITH ONE OF ITS PRIMARY DERIVATIVES

COUNTERPARTIES. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT EITHER PARTY IS REQUIRED TO POST ELIGIBLE

COLLATERAL WHEN THE MARKET VALUE OF TRANSACTIONS COVERED BY THE AGREEMENT

EXCEEDS SPECIFIED THRESHOLDS, THUS LIMITING CREDIT EXPOSURE FOR BOTH PARTIES.

FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

AT DECEMBER 31,

2007 AND 2006, THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INCLUDED CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS, MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, INVESTMENTS, ACCOUNTS

PAYABLE, BORROWINGS, AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS, ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, AND SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS

AND CURRENT PORTION OF LONG-TERM DEBT (EXCEPT THE $350 MILLION DEALER

REMARKETABLE SECURITY) APPROXIMATED CARRYING VALUES BECAUSE OF THE SHORT-TERM

NATURE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE MARKETABLE SECURITIES,

INVESTMENTS AND DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS ARE REPORTED AT FAIR VALUES. FAIR VALUES

FOR INVESTMENTS HELD AT COST ARE NOT READILY AVAILABLE, BUT ARE ESTIMATED TO

APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE. THE CARRYING AMOUNTS AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF OTHER

RENTAL EXPENSE UNDER

THEREBY GIVING 3M THE RIGHT, BUT NOT THE OBLIGATION, TO MAINTAIN A PRESENCE IN

A LEASED FACILITY. 3MS PRIMARY CAPITAL LEASE, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN APRIL 2003,

INVOLVES A BUILDING IN THE UNITED KINGDOM (WITH A LEASE TERM OF 22 YEARS).

DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003, 3M RECORDED A CAPITAL LEASE ASSET AND

$141 MILLION IN 2005). RECEIVABLES DUE FROM RELATED PARTIES (LARGELY RELATED TO

RECEIVABLES FROM EMPLOYEES FOR RELOCATION AND OTHER ORDINARY BUSINESS EXPENSE

ADVANCES) TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $40 MILLION IN 2007 ($36 MILLION IN 2006,

AND $37 MILLION IN 2005). 3M SALES TO RELATED PARTIES TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $6

MILLION IN 2007 ($4 MILLION IN 2006, AND $5 MILLION IN 2005). INDEBTEDNESS TO

3M FROM RELATED PARTIES WAS NOT MATERIAL IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005.

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS.

THE COMPANY AND SOME OF ITS SUBSIDIARIES ARE INVOLVED IN NUMEROUS CLAIMS

AND LAWSUITS, PRINCIPALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, AND REGULATORY PROCEEDINGS

WORLDWIDE. THESE INCLUDE VARIOUS PRODUCTS LIABILITY (INVOLVING PRODUCTS THAT

THE COMPANY NOW OR FORMERLY MANUFACTURED AND SOLD), INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, AND

COMMERCIAL CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS, INCLUDING THOSE BROUGHT UNDER THE ANTITRUST

LAWS, AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS. THE FOLLOWING SECTIONS FIRST DESCRIBE THE

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS INVOLVED, AND THEN

DESCRIBE THE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES THE COMPANY HAS ACCRUED

RELATING TO ITS SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. UNLESS OTHERWISE STATED, THE

COMPANY IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING ALL SUCH LITIGATION.

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, IN JULY 2007, A SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE

LAWSUIT WAS FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE

AGAINST THE COMPANY AS NOMINAL DEFENDANT AND AGAINST EACH THEN CURRENT MEMBER

OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE OFFICERS NAMED IN THE SUMMARY COMPENSATION

TABLE OF THE 2007 PROXY STATEMENT. THE SUIT ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANYS 2007

PROXY STATEMENT CONTAINED FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE TAX

DEDUCTIBILITY OF COMPENSATION PAYABLE UNDER THE EXECUTIVE ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN

(PLAN) AND THE STANDARDS FOR DETERMINING THE AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER THE PLAN.

THE LAWSUIT SEEKS A DECLARATION VOIDING SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE PLAN,

TERMINATION OF THE PLAN, VOIDING THE ELECTIONS OF DIRECTORS, EQUITABLE

ACCOUNTING, AND AWARDING COSTS, INCLUDING ATTORNEYS FEES. PLAINTIFF FILED A MOTION FOR SUMMARY

JUDGMENT, AND THE DEFENDANTS FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS ALL CLAIMS ON THE

GROUNDS THAT PLAINTIFF HAD FAILED TO MAKE A DEMAND ON THE BOARD AND HAD

OTHERWISE FAILED TO STATE A PROPER CLAIM UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES

LITIGATION REFORM ACT. THE DEFENDANTS ALSO MOVED TO TRANSFER THE CASE FROM THE

DISTRICT OF DELAWARE TO THE DISTRICT OF MINNESOTA. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE COURT

DENIED WITHOUT PREJUDICE THE PLAINTIFFS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT.

BREAST IMPLANT LITIGATION

THE COMPANY AND CERTAIN OTHER COMPANIES WERE NAMED AS DEFENDANTS IN PAST

YEARS IN NUMEROUS CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS ALLEGING DAMAGES FOR PERSONAL INJURIES OF

VARIOUS TYPES RESULTING FROM BREAST IMPLANTS FORMERLY MANUFACTURED BY THE

COMPANY OR A RELATED COMPANY. THE VAST MAJORITY OF CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY HAVE

BEEN RESOLVED. THE COMPANY DOES NOT CONSIDER ITS REMAINING PROBABLE LIABILITY

TO BE MATERIAL. INFORMATION CONCERNING THE ASSOCIATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLE AND

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATED TO IT FOLLOWS IN THE PARAGRAPH ENTITLED

BREAST IMPLANT INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS

LITIGATION

FOR MORE THAN 25 YEARS THE COMPANY HAS DEFENDED AND RESOLVED THE CLAIMS

OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS ALLEGING INJURIES FROM

OCCUPATIONAL DUST EXPOSURES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY IS A

NAMED DEFENDANT, WITH MULTIPLE CO-DEFENDANTS, IN NUMEROUS LAWSUITS IN VARIOUS

COURTS THAT PURPORT TO REPRESENT APPROXIMATELY 8,750 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS, A

DECREASE FROM THE APPROXIMATELY 17,700 INDIVIDUAL CLAIMANTS WITH ACTIONS

PENDING AT DECEMBER 31, 2006.

THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS RESOLVED BY AND CURRENTLY

PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY ALLEGE USE OF SOME OF THE COMPANYS MASK AND

RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND SEEK DAMAGES FROM THE COMPANY AND OTHER DEFENDANTS FOR

ALLEGED PERSONAL INJURY FROM WORKPLACE EXPOSURES TO ASBESTOS, SILICA, COAL OR

OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS FOUND IN PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS OR

GENERALLY IN THE WORKPLACE. A MINORITY OF CLAIMANTS GENERALLY ALLEGE PERSONAL

INJURY FROM OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO ASBESTOS FROM PRODUCTS PREVIOUSLY

MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY, WHICH ARE OFTEN UNSPECIFIED, AS WELL AS PRODUCTS

MANUFACTURED BY OTHER DEFENDANTS, OR OCCASIONALLY AT COMPANY PREMISES.

IN MANY OF THESE LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS, THE COMPANY IS NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT WITH MULTIPLE CO-DEFENDANTS WHERE NO PRODUCT THE COMPANY MANUFACTURED

IS IDENTIFIED OR WHERE THE COMPANY IS ULTIMATELY DETERMINED NOT TO HAVE

MANUFACTURED THE PRODUCTS IDENTIFIED BY THE PLAINTIFFS. THE COMPANYS VIGOROUS

DEFENSE OF THIS LITIGATION HAS RESULTED IN DISMISSALS OF MANY CLAIMS WITHOUT

ANY PAYMENT BY THE COMPANY, AND JURY VERDICTS FOR THE COMPANY IN SEVEN OF THE

EIGHT CASES TRIED TO VERDICT (SUCH TRIALS OCCURRED IN 1999, 2000, 2003, 2004

AND 2007), AND AN APPELLATE REVERSAL IN 2005 OF THE ONE JURY VERDICT ADVERSE TO

THE COMPANY.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY WON A DEFENSE VERDICT IN JULY 2007

FROM A JURY IN THE FEDERAL COURT IN EASTERN DISTRICT OF MISSOURI.  THE JURY FOUND THE COMPANY HAD NO LIABILITY

WHATEVER TO A PLAINTIFF WHO CLAIMED HE HAD SILICOSIS AND A RELATED CANCER AND

SOUGHT TO RECOVER DAMAGES FROM THE COMPANY ARISING FROM HIS ALLEGED ILLNESS,

WHICH HE CLAIMED TO HAVE CONTRACTED FROM OCCUPATIONAL EXPOSURE TO SILICA

DESPITE HIS PURPORTED USE OF THE COMPANYS RESPIRATOR MASK EQUIPMENT AT VARIOUS

TIMES. THE JURY REJECTED EACH OF THE PLAINTIFFS THEORIES OF LIABILITY AGAINST

THE COMPANY.

74

MANY OF THE RESOLVED LAWSUITS AND CLAIMS INVOLVED UNIMPAIRED CLAIMANTS

WHO WERE RECRUITED BY PLAINTIFFS LAWYERS THROUGH MASS CHEST X-RAY SCREENINGS.

THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS FILED IN

2007 FROM PRIOR YEARS BY APPARENTLY UNIMPAIRED CLAIMANTS. THE COMPANY

ATTRIBUTES THIS DECLINE TO SEVERAL FACTORS, INCLUDING CERTAIN CHANGES ENACTED

IN SEVERAL STATES IN RECENT YEARS OF THE LAW GOVERNING ASBESTOS-RELATED CLAIMS,

AND THE HIGHLY-PUBLICIZED DECISION IN MID-2005 OF THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS THAT IDENTIFIED AND CRITICIZED ABUSES

BY CERTAIN ATTORNEYS, DOCTORS AND X-RAY SCREENING COMPANIES ON BEHALF OF

CLAIMANTS. THE COMPANY EXPECTS THE FILING OF CLAIMS BY UNIMPAIRED CLAIMANTS IN

THE FUTURE TO CONTINUE AT MUCH LOWER LEVELS THAN IN THE PAST. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT DUE TO THIS CHANGE IN THE TYPE AND VOLUME OF INCOMING CLAIMS, IT

IS LIKELY THAT THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS ALLEGING MORE SERIOUS INJURIES, INCLUDING

MESOTHELIOMA AND OTHER MALIGNANCIES, WHILE REMAINING RELATIVELY CONSTANT, WILL

REPRESENT A GREATER PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CLAIMS THAN IN THE PAST. THE COMPANY

HAS DEMONSTRATED IN PAST TRIAL PROCEEDINGS THAT ITS RESPIRATORY PROTECTION

PRODUCTS ARE EFFECTIVE AS CLAIMED WHEN USED IN THE INTENDED MANNER AND IN THE

INTENDED CIRCUMSTANCES. CONSEQUENTLY THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT CLAIMANTS ARE

UNABLE TO ESTABLISH THAT THEIR MEDICAL CONDITIONS, EVEN IF SIGNIFICANT, ARE

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANYS RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS. NONETHELESS THE

COMPANYS LITIGATION EXPERIENCE INDICATES THAT SUCH CLAIMS ARE COSTLIER TO

RESOLVE THAN THE CLAIMS OF UNIMPAIRED PERSONS, AND IT THEREFORE ANTICIPATES AN

INCREASE IN THE AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING PENDING AND FUTURE CLAIMS ON A

PER-CLAIM BASIS THAN IT EXPERIENCED IN PRIOR PERIODS WHEN THE VAST MAJORITY OF

CLAIMS WERE ASSERTED BY THE UNIMPAIRED.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE ASSERTED SPECIFIC DOLLAR CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES IN

APPROXIMATELY 66% OF THE 3,979 LAWSUITS THAT WERE PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY

AT THE END OF 2007 IN ALL JURISDICTIONS. A MAJORITY OF STATES RESTRICT OR

PROHIBIT SPECIFYING DAMAGES IN TORT CASES SUCH AS THESE, AND MOST OF THE

REMAINING JURISDICTIONS DO NOT REQUIRE SUCH SPECIFICATION. IN THOSE CASES IN

WHICH PLAINTIFFS CHOOSE TO ASSERT SPECIFIC DOLLAR AMOUNTS IN THEIR COMPLAINTS,

BROUGHT IN STATES THAT PERMIT SUCH PLEADING, THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED ARE TYPICALLY

NOT MEANINGFUL AS AN INDICATOR OF THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL LIABILITY. THIS IS

BECAUSE (A) THE AMOUNTS CLAIMED TYPICALLY BEAR NO RELATION TO THE EXTENT

OF THE PLAINTIFFS INJURY, IF ANY; (B) THE COMPLAINTS NEARLY ALWAYS ASSERT

CLAIMS AGAINST MULTIPLE DEFENDANTS WITH THE TYPICAL COMPLAINT ASSERTING CLAIMS

AGAINST AS FEW AS A DOZEN DIFFERENT DEFENDANTS TO UPWARDS OF 275 DIFFERENT

DEFENDANTS, THE DAMAGES ALLEGED ARE NOT ATTRIBUTED TO INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS,

AND A DEFENDANTS SHARE OF LIABILITY MAY TURN ON THE LAW OF JOINT AND SEVERAL

LIABILITY, WHICH CAN VARY BY STATE, AND BY THE AMOUNT OF FAULT A JURY ALLOCATES

TO EACH DEFENDANT IF A CASE IS ULTIMATELY TRIED BEFORE A JURY; (C) MANY

CASES ARE FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY EVEN THOUGH THE PLAINTIFFS DID NOT USE ANY

OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS AND, ULTIMATELY, ARE WITHDRAWN OR DISMISSED WITHOUT

ANY PAYMENT; AND (D) MANY CASES ARE BROUGHT ON BEHALF OF PLAINTIFFS WHO

HAVE NOT SUFFERED ANY MEDICAL INJURY, AND, ULTIMATELY, ARE RESOLVED WITHOUT ANY

PAYMENT OR A PAYMENT THAT IS A SMALL FRACTION OF THE DAMAGES INITIALLY CLAIMED.

OF THE 2,629 PENDING CASES IN WHICH PURPORTED DAMAGE AMOUNTS ARE SPECIFIED IN

THE COMPLAINTS, 860 CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $100,000 OR LESS, (ONE (1) OF

THEM ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $15,000, NINE (9) OF THEM ALSO

ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $30,000, AND THREE (3) OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE

PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $1,000,000); 186 CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS BETWEEN $100,000 AND

$3 MILLION (THIRTY-THREE (33) OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $250,000,

ONE (1) OF THEM ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $1 MILLION, FORTY-THREE

(43) OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $1.5 MILLION, AND 106 OF THEM ALSO

ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $2 MILLION); TWO (2) CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $3

MILLION TO $7.5 MILLION (ONE (1) ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $350,000

AND ONE (1) OF THEM ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $5 MILLION);

21 CASES INVOLVE

CLAIMS OF $7.5 MILLION; FOUR (4) CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $7.5 MILLION TO

$10 MILLION (FOUR (4) OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE DAMAGES OF $21 MILLION); 1,540

CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $10 MILLION (TWO (2) OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE

DAMAGES OF $350,000, 1,531 OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $10 MILLION,

AND ONE (1) OF THEM ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $15 MILLION); 13

CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF $10 MILLION TO $50 MILLION (ONE (1) OF THEM ALSO

ALLEGE PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $15 MILLION, FIVE (5) OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE

PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $15.5 MILLION, AND THREE (3) OF THEM ALSO ALLEGE

PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $20 MILLION); AND THREE (3) CASES INVOLVE CLAIMS OF

$50 MILLION (TWO (2) OF THEM ALSO ALLEGES PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $50

MILLION). SOME COMPLAINTS ALLEGE THAT THE COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES ARE

AT LEAST THE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED. AS STATED, THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE AND THE

OTHER REASONS CITED INDICATE THAT THE DAMAGE AMOUNTS SPECIFIED IN COMPLAINTS

ARE NOT A MEANINGFUL FACTOR IN ANY ASSESSMENT OF THE COMPANYS POTENTIAL

LIABILITY.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE STATE OF WEST VIRGINIA, THROUGH ITS ATTORNEY

GENERAL, FILED A COMPLAINT IN 2003 AGAINST THE COMPANY AND TWO OTHER

MANUFACTURERS OF RESPIRATORY PROTECTION PRODUCTS IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF

LINCOLN COUNTY, WEST VIRGINIA AND AMENDED IT IN 2005. THE AMENDED COMPLAINT

SEEKS SUBSTANTIAL, BUT UNSPECIFIED, COMPENSATORY DAMAGES PRIMARILY FOR

REIMBURSEMENT OF THE COSTS ALLEGEDLY INCURRED BY THE STATE FOR WORKERS

COMPENSATION AND HEALTHCARE BENEFITS PROVIDED TO

ALL WORKERS WITH OCCUPATIONAL

PNEUMOCONIOSIS AND

UNSPECIFIED PUNITIVE DAMAGES.

EMPLOYMENT LITIGATION

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, ONE CURRENT AND ONE FORMER EMPLOYEE OF THE

COMPANY FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF RAMSEY COUNTY,

MINNESOTA, IN DECEMBER 2004, SEEKING TO REPRESENT A CLASS OF ALL CURRENT

AND CERTAIN FORMER SALARIED EMPLOYEES EMPLOYED BY 3M IN MINNESOTA BELOW A

CERTAIN SALARY GRADE WHO WERE AGE 46 OR OLDER AT ANY TIME DURING THE APPLICABLE

PERIOD TO BE DETERMINED BY THE COURT. THE COMPLAINT ALLEGES THE PLAINTIFFS

SUFFERED VARIOUS FORMS OF EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION ON THE BASIS OF AGE IN

VIOLATION OF THE MINNESOTA HUMAN RIGHTS ACT AND SEEKS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF,

UNSPECIFIED COMPENSATORY DAMAGES (WHICH THEY SEEK TO TREBLE UNDER THE STATUTE),

INCLUDING BACK AND FRONT PAY, PUNITIVE DAMAGES (LIMITED BY STATUTE TO $8,500

PER CLAIMANT) AND ATTORNEYS FEES. IN JANUARY 2006, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED A

MOTION TO JOIN FOUR ADDITIONAL NAMED PLAINTIFFS. THIS MOTION WAS UNOPPOSED BY

THE COMPANY AND THE FOUR PLAINTIFFS WERE JOINED IN THE

75

CASE, ALTHOUGH ONE CLAIM HAS BEEN DISMISSED FOLLOWING AN INDIVIDUAL

SETTLEMENT. THE CLASS CERTIFICATION HEARING WAS HELD IN DECEMBER 2007. THE

COMPANY EXPECTS A RULING ON THE CLASS CERTIFICATION IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2008.

A SIMILAR AGE DISCRIMINATION PURPORTED CLASS ACTION WAS FILED AGAINST

THE COMPANY IN NOVEMBER 2005 IN THE SUPERIOR COURT OF ESSEX COUNTY, NEW

JERSEY, ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OF NEW JERSEY-BASED EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY. THE

COMPANY REMOVED THIS CASE TO THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT

OF NEW JERSEY. ON JUNE 29, 2007, THE ATTORNEYS FOR THE PLAINTIFF AMENDED

THEIR COMPLAINT AND DROPPED THE CLASS ACTION ALLEGATIONS.

IN ADDITION, THREE FORMER EMPLOYEES FILED AGE DISCRIMINATION CHARGES

AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH THE U.S. EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND

THE PERTINENT STATE AGENCIES IN MINNESOTA AND CALIFORNIA DURING 2005; TWO OF

THESE CHARGES WERE AMENDED IN 2006. SUCH FILINGS INCLUDE ALLEGATIONS THAT THE

RELEASE OF CLAIMS SIGNED BY CERTAIN FORMER EMPLOYEES IN THE PURPORTED CLASS

DEFINED IN THE CHARGES IS INVALID FOR VARIOUS REASONS AND ASSERT AGE

DISCRIMINATION CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF CERTAIN CURRENT AND FORMER SALARIED

EMPLOYEES IN STATES OTHER THAN MINNESOTA AND NEW JERSEY. IN 2006, ONE CURRENT

EMPLOYEE FILED AN AGE DISCRIMINATION CHARGE AGAINST THE COMPANY WITH THE U.S.

EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY COMMISSION AND THE PERTINENT STATE AGENCY IN

MISSOURI, ASSERTING CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF A CLASS OF ALL CURRENT AND CERTAIN

FORMER SALARIED EMPLOYEES WHO WORKED IN MISSOURI AND OTHER STATES OTHER THAN

MINNESOTA AND NEW JERSEY. THE SAME LAW FIRM REPRESENTS THE PLAINTIFFS AND

CLAIMANTS IN EACH OF THESE PROCEEDINGS.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND

LITIGATION

THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND

REGULATIONS INCLUDING THOSE PERTAINING TO AIR EMISSIONS, WASTEWATER DISCHARGES,

TOXIC SUBSTANCES, AND THE HANDLING AND DISPOSAL OF SOLID AND HAZARDOUS WASTES

ENFORCEABLE BY NATIONAL, STATE, AND LOCAL AUTHORITIES AROUND THE WORLD, AND

PRIVATE PARTIES IN THE UNITED STATES AND ABROAD. THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS

PROVIDE, UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, A BASIS FOR THE REMEDIATION OF

CONTAMINATION AND FOR PERSONAL INJURY AND PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS. THE COMPANY

HAS INCURRED, AND WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR, COSTS AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES IN

COMPLYING WITH THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS, DEFENDING PERSONAL INJURY AND

PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS, AND MODIFYING ITS BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN LIGHT OF ITS

ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSIBILITIES. IN ITS EFFORT TO SATISFY ITS ENVIRONMENTAL

RESPONSIBILITIES AND COMPLY WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE

COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED, AND PERIODICALLY UPDATES, POLICIES RELATING TO

ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS OF PERFORMANCE FOR ITS OPERATIONS WORLDWIDE.

REMEDIATION

: UNDER CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS, INCLUDING THE UNITED STATES COMPREHENSIVE ENVIRONMENTAL RESPONSE, COMPENSATION

AND LIABILITY ACT OF 1980 AND SIMILAR STATE LAWS, THE COMPANY MAY BE JOINTLY

AND SEVERALLY LIABLE, TYPICALLY WITH OTHER COMPANIES, FOR THE COSTS OF

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AT CURRENT OR FORMER FACILITIES AND AT OFF-SITE

LOCATIONS. THE COMPANY HAS IDENTIFIED NUMEROUS LOCATIONS, MOST OF WHICH ARE IN

THE UNITED STATES, AT WHICH IT MAY HAVE SOME LIABILITY.

PLEASE REFER TO THE FOLLOWING SECTION, 

ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

 FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THIS SUBJECT.

REGULATORY ACTIVITIES

: AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE

COMPANY HAS BEEN VOLUNTARILY COOPERATING WITH ONGOING REVIEWS BY LOCAL, STATE,

NATIONAL (PRIMARILY THE U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY (EPA)), AND

INTERNATIONAL AGENCIES OF POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL AND HEALTH EFFECTS OF

PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS (PERFLUROOCTANOIC ACID OR PFOA AND PERFLUOROOCTANE

SULFONATE OR PFOS) AND RELATED COMPOUNDS. AS A RESULT OF ITS PHASE-OUT

DECISION IN MAY 2000, THE COMPANY NO LONGER MANUFACTURES PERFLUOROOCTANYL

COMPOUNDS, EXCEPT THAT A SUBSIDIARY RECOVERS AND RECYCLES PFOA IN GENDORF,

GERMANY, FOR INTERNAL USE IN PRODUCTION PROCESSES AND HAS AGREED TO A PRODUCT

STEWARDSHIP INITIATIVE WITH THE EPA TO WORK TOWARD ELIMINATION OF ITS USE OF

PFOA BY 2015.

REGULATORY

ACTIVITIES CONCERNING PFOA AND/OR PFOS CONTINUE IN EUROPE AND ELSEWHERE, AND

BEFORE CERTAIN INTERNATIONAL BODIES. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE GATHERING OF

EXPOSURE AND USE INFORMATION, RISK ASSESSMENT, AND CONSIDERATION OF REGULATORY

APPROACHES.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY, IN COOPERATION WITH STATE AGENCIES,

TESTED SOIL AND GROUNDWATER BENEATH THREE FORMER WASTE DISPOSAL SITES IN

WASHINGTON COUNTY, MINNESOTA, USED MANY YEARS AGO BY THE COMPANY TO DISPOSE

LAWFULLY OF WASTE CONTAINING PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS. IN ADDITION, SUBSEQUENT

TESTING OF WATER FROM CERTAIN MUNICIPAL WELLS IN OAKDALE, MINNESOTA AND SOME

PRIVATE WELLS IN LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA, INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF LOW LEVELS OF

PFOS AND PFOA THAT, IN SOME CASES, WERE SLIGHTLY ABOVE GUIDELINES ESTABLISHED

BY THE MINNESOTA DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH (MDH).

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY ADDRESSED THE PRESENCE OF THESE

COMPOUNDS IN THE WATER BY TREATING CERTAIN MUNICIPAL WELLS IN OAKDALE AND BY

PROVIDING A GRANT TO THE CITY OF LAKE ELMO TO EXTEND CITY WATER TO CERTAIN

RESIDENTS WITH THESE COMPOUNDS IN THEIR PRIVATE WELLS. IN MARCH 2007 THE

MDH LOWERED THE HEALTH-BASED VALUES (HBVS) (I.E., THE AMOUNT OF A CHEMICAL IN

DRINKING WATER CONSIDERED BY THE MDH STAFF TO BE SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO DRINK FOR A

LIFETIME) FOR PFOA FROM 7 PARTS PER BILLION (PPB) TO 0.5 PPB AND FOR PFOS FROM

1 PPB TO 0.3 PPB. IN AUGUST 2007 THE MDH ESTABLISHED THESE SAME LEVELS AS

HEALTH RISK LIMITS (HRL) (I.E., THE AMOUNT OF A CHEMICAL IN DRINKING WATER

DETERMINED BY THE MDH TO BE SAFE FOR PEOPLE TO DRINK FOR A LIFETIME) THROUGH AN

EXPEDITED RULE-MAKING PROCESS. IN A FINAL REPORT ISSUED ON JANUARY 15,

2008, THE MDH PROPOSED A DRAFT VALUE TO LOWER THE HRL FOR PFOA FROM 0.5 PPB TO

0.3 PPB IN ANTICIPATION OF HRL RULE-MAKING IN 2008.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE MDH HAS ALSO DETECTED LOW LEVELS OF A

PERFLUORINATED COMPOUND CALLED PERFLUOROBUTANOIC ACID (PFBA) IN MUNICIPAL WELLS

(AND IN PRIVATE WELLS AS ANNOUNCED BY THE MDH IN JUNE 2007) IN SIX NEARBY

COMMUNITIES (WOODBURY, COTTAGE GROVE, NEWPORT, ST. PAUL PARK, SOUTH ST. PAUL,

AND HASTINGS, ALL COMMUNITIES LOCATED SOUTHEAST OF

76

ST. PAUL), SOME OF WHICH SLIGHTLY EXCEED THE MDHS WELL GUIDANCE FOR

PFBA, CURRENTLY AT 1 PPB. THE COMPANY IS WORKING WITH THE MDH AND THE MINNESOTA

POLLUTION CONTROL AGENCY (MPCA) IN ASSESSING THE SOURCE OF PFBA IN THESE WELLS

AND IS SUPPLYING DATA THAT COULD BE USED IN DETERMINING AN APPROPRIATE DRINKING

WATER GUIDELINE LEVEL. THE MDH HAS NOT ISSUED AN HBV FOR PFBA, BUT THE COMPANY

EXPECTS THE MDH TO ISSUE FURTHER GUIDANCE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008. THE

COMPANY HAS ADVISED THE AFFECTED COMMUNITIES THAT IT WILL ASSIST THEM IN

ASSURING THEIR DRINKING WATER FALLS BELOW THE HBV FOR PFBA WHEN SUCH VALUE IS

FINALLY DETERMINED.

ON MAY 22, 2007, THE MPCA CITIZENS BOARD APPROVED THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT AND CONSENT ORDER TO ADDRESS THE PRESENCE OF PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS

IN THE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER AT FORMER DISPOSAL SITES IN WASHINGTON COUNTY

MINNESOTA AND AT THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITY AT COTTAGE GROVE

MINNESOTA. UNDER THIS AGREEMENT, THE COMPANY AGREED TO (I) EVALUATE

RELEASES OF PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS FROM THESE SITES AND PROPOSE RESPONSE

ACTIONS; (II) PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE DRINKING WATER IF AND WHEN AN HBV OR HRL

IS EXCEEDED FOR ANY PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS AS A RESULT OF CONTAMINATION FROM

THESE SITES; (III) SHARE INFORMATION WITH THE MPCA ABOUT PERFLUORINATED

COMPOUNDS; (IV) REIMBURSE THE MPCA FUTURE COSTS OF RESEARCH THAT ARE

CONNECTED TO RELEASES FROM THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS IN MINNESOTA (THE COMPANY

AGREED TO REIMBURSE THE MPCA FOR PAST RESEARCH COSTS AND PROVIDED A GRANT UP TO

$5 MILLION OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS FOR THE PURPOSE OF INVESTIGATING AND

ASSESSING THE PRESENCE AND EFFECTS OF PERFLOURONATED COMPOUNDS IN THE

ENVIRONMENT AND BIOTA); AND (V) PAY THE MPCA UP TO $8 MILLION TOWARDS THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF REMEDIAL ACTIONS AT THE WASHINGTON COUNTY LANDFILL.  THE COMPANY IS WORKING WITH THE MPCA UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT AND CONSENT ORDER TO PROPOSE ALTERNATIVES

THAT THE MPCA WILL CONSIDER TO ADDRESS THE PRESENCE OF PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS

IN THE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER AT THESE SITES.

THE COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT WHAT REGULATORY ACTIONS ARISING FROM THE

FOREGOING PROCEEDINGS AND ACTIVITIES, IF ANY, MAY BE TAKEN REGARDING SUCH

COMPOUNDS OR THE CONSEQUENCES OF ANY SUCH ACTIONS.

IN FEBRUARY 2008,

THE EPA NOTIFIED THE COMPANY THAT IT IS SEEKING $173,000 IN PENALTIES DUE TO

ALLEGED PAST VIOLATIONS OF CERTAIN MONITORING AND RECORD KEEPING REQUIREMENTS UNDER

FEDERAL AIR POLLUTION REGULATIONS AT THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITY IN

COTTAGE GROVE, MINNESOTA. THE COMPANY HAD BEEN OPERATING UNDER A MONITORING AND

RECORD KEEPING APPROACH THAT HAD BEEN APPROVED BY THE MPCA. THE EPA HAS NOW

APPROVED THE COMPANYS ALTERNATIVE MONITORING AND RECORD KEEPING APPROACH.

LITIGATION

: AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, A

FORMER EMPLOYEE FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN 2002 IN THE CIRCUIT

COURT OF MORGAN COUNTY, ALABAMA, INVOLVING PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY, ALLEGING

THAT THE PLAINTIFFS SUFFERED FEAR, INCREASED RISK, SUBCLINICAL INJURIES, AND

PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM EXPOSURE TO PERFLUOROOCTANYL CHEMISTRY AT OR NEAR THE

COMPANYS DECATUR, ALABAMA, MANUFACTURING FACILITY.

THE CIRCUIT COURT IN 2005 GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION

TO DISMISS THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS PERSONAL INJURY-RELATED CLAIMS ON THE BASIS

THAT SUCH CLAIMS ARE BARRED BY THE EXCLUSIVITY PROVISIONS OF THE STATES

WORKERS COMPENSATION ACT. THE PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT IN

NOVEMBER 2006, LIMITING THE CASE TO PROPERTY DAMAGE CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF A

PURPORTED CLASS OF RESIDENTS AND PROPERTY OWNERS IN THE VICINITY OF THE DECATUR

PLANT. ALSO IN

2005, THE JUDGE IN A SECOND

PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT (FILED BY THREE RESIDENTS OF MORGAN COUNTY,

ALABAMA, SEEKING UNSTATED COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES INVOLVING ALLEGED

DAMAGE TO THEIR PROPERTY FROM EMISSIONS OF PERFLUOROOCTANYL COMPOUNDS FROM THE

COMPANYS DECATUR, ALABAMA, MANUFACTURING FACILITY THAT FORMERLY MANUFACTURED

THOSE COMPOUNDS) GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO ABATE THE CASE, EFFECTIVELY

PUTTING THE CASE ON HOLD PENDING THE RESOLUTION OF CLASS CERTIFICATION ISSUES

IN THE ACTION DESCRIBED ABOVE FILED IN THE SAME COURT IN 2002. DESPITE THE

STAY, PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT SEEKING DAMAGES FOR ALLEGED

PERSONAL INJURIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE ON BEHALF OF THE NAMED PLAINTIFFS AND THE

MEMBERS OF A PURPORTED CLASS. NO FURTHER ACTION IN THE CASE IS EXPECTED UNLESS

AND UNTIL THE STAY IS LIFTED.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, TWO RESIDENTS OF WASHINGTON COUNTY, MINNESOTA,

FILED IN OCTOBER 2004 A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION IN THE DISTRICT COURT OF

WASHINGTON COUNTY ON BEHALF OF WASHINGTON COUNTY RESIDENTS WHO HAVE ALLEGEDLY

SUFFERED PERSONAL INJURIES AND PROPERTY DAMAGE FROM

ALLEGED EMISSIONS FROM THE FORMER PERFLUOROOCTANYL

PRODUCTION FACILITY AT COTTAGE GROVE, MINNESOTA, AND FROM HISTORIC WASTE

DISPOSAL SITES IN THE VICINITY OF THAT FACILITY.

AFTER THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THE COMPANYS MOTION TO

DISMISS THE CLAIMS FOR MEDICAL MONITORING AND PUBLIC NUISANCE IN APRIL 2005,

THE PLAINTIFFS FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT ADDING ADDITIONAL ALLEGATIONS

INVOLVING OTHER PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY, ALLEGING

ADDITIONAL LEGAL THEORIES IN SUPPORT OF THEIR CLAIMS, ADDING FOUR PLAINTIFFS,

AND SEEKING RELIEF BASED ON ALLEGED CONTAMINATION OF THE CITY OF OAKDALE

MUNICIPAL WATER SUPPLY AND CERTAIN PRIVATE WELLS IN THE VICINITY OF LAKE ELMO,

MINNESOTA. IN APRIL 2006, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT

ADDING TWO ADDITIONAL PLAINTIFFS. THE TWO ORIGINAL PLAINTIFFS THEREAFTER

DISMISSED THEIR CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY. AFTER A HEARING ON THE PLAINTIFFS

MOTION TO CERTIFY THE CASE AS A CLASS ACTION AT THE END OF MARCH 2007, THE

COURT ON JUNE 19, 2007 DENIED THE PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO CERTIFY THE

LITIGATION AS A CLASS ACTION. THE TRIAL OF THE INDIVIDUAL CASES IS SCHEDULED

FOR JANUARY 2009.

SEVERAL HUNDRED PLAINTIFFS WHO CLAIM TO HAVE LIVED IN THE VICINITY OF

THE ACME BARREL COMPANYS STORAGE DRUM RECONDITIONING FACILITY IN CHICAGO,

ILLINOIS, FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF

COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS, AGAINST 3M AND A NUMBER OF OTHER COMPANIES THAT

ALLEGEDLY WERE CUSTOMERS OF ACME BARREL. SINCE THE COURT REJECTED PLAINTIFFS

ATTEMPT TO HAVE THIS LITIGATION PROCEED AS A CLASS ACTION, 71 INDIVIDUALS HAVE

ASSERTED CLAIMS AGAINST THE COMPANY AND SEVERAL OTHER DEFENDANTS FOR DAMAGES

ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY EMISSIONS OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS FROM THE ACME BARREL DRUM

RECONDITIONING FACILITY.

77

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006, THE NEW JERSEY DEPARTMENT OF

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION SERVED A LAWSUIT THAT WAS FILED IN NEW JERSEY STATE

COURT AGAINST THE COMPANY AND SEVERAL OTHER COMPANIES SEEKING CLEANUP AND

REMOVAL COSTS AND DAMAGES TO NATURAL RESOURCES ALLEGEDLY CAUSED BY THE

DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES FROM TWO FORMER WASTE DISPOSAL SITES IN NEW

JERSEY. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, THE COMPANY NEGOTIATED A SETTLEMENT OF NEW

JERSEYS CLAIMS.  UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

SETTLEMENT, THE COMPANY WILL TRANSFER TO THE STATE OF NEW JERSEY 150 ACRES OF

UNDEVELOPED LAND WITH GROUNDWATER RECHARGE POTENTIAL, WHICH THE COMPANY

ACQUIRED FOR PURPOSES OF THE SETTLEMENT, AND WILL PAY THE STATES ATTORNEYS

FEES. NOTICE OF THE SETTLEMENT WAS PUBLISHED FOR PUBLIC COMMENT IN DECEMBER 2007,

AND NO OBJECTIONS WERE RECEIVED. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY AND THE STATE OF NEW

JERSEY HAVE SIGNED THE FORMAL SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT PURSUANT TO WHICH THE

COMPANY WILL TRANSFER TITLE TO THE PROPERTY AND WILL BE DISMISSED FROM THE

LAWSUIT, WHICH WILL CONTINUE AGAINST THE CODEFENDANTS.

ACCRUED LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES RELATED TO LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS

THE COMPANY COMPLIES WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 5, ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES, AND RELATED

GUIDANCE, AND RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR LEGAL PROCEEDINGS IN THOSE INSTANCES

WHERE IT CAN REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS AND WHERE LIABILITY IS

PROBABLE. WHERE THE REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE PROBABLE LOSS IS A RANGE, THE COMPANY

RECORDS THE MOST LIKELY ESTIMATE OF THE LOSS, OR THE LOW END OF THE RANGE IF

THERE IS NO ONE BEST ESTIMATE. THE COMPANY EITHER DISCLOSES THE AMOUNT OF A

POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS IN EXCESS OF ESTABLISHED RESERVES IF ESTIMABLE,

OR STATES THAT SUCH AN ESTIMATE CANNOT BE MADE. FOR THOSE INSURED MATTERS WHERE

THE COMPANY HAS TAKEN A RESERVE, THE COMPANY ALSO RECORDS RECEIVABLES FOR THE

AMOUNT OF INSURANCE THAT IT EXPECTS TO RECOVER UNDER THE COMPANYS INSURANCE

PROGRAM. FOR THOSE INSURED MATTERS WHERE THE COMPANY HAS NOT TAKEN A RESERVE

BECAUSE THE LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT

ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, BUT WHERE THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED AN EXPENSE IN DEFENDING

ITSELF, THE COMPANY RECORDS RECEIVABLES FOR THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE THAT IT

EXPECTS TO RECOVER FOR THE EXPENSE INCURRED. THE COMPANY DISCLOSES SIGNIFICANT

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS EVEN WHERE LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR THE AMOUNT OF THE

LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, IF THE COMPANY BELIEVES THERE IS AT LEAST

A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS MAY BE INCURRED.

BECAUSE LITIGATION IS SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES, AND UNFAVORABLE

RULINGS OR DEVELOPMENTS COULD OCCUR, THERE CAN BE NO CERTAINTY THAT THE COMPANY

MAY NOT ULTIMATELY INCUR CHARGES IN EXCESS OF PRESENTLY RECORDED LIABILITIES. A

FUTURE ADVERSE RULING, SETTLEMENT, OR UNFAVORABLE DEVELOPMENT COULD RESULT IN

FUTURE CHARGES THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR CASH FLOWS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY ARE RECORDED.

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT SUCH FUTURE CHARGES, IF ANY, WOULD NOT HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE

COMPANY, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ITS SIGNIFICANT AVAILABLE INSURANCE COVERAGE.

BASED ON EXPERIENCE AND DEVELOPMENTS, THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY REEXAMINES ITS

ESTIMATES OF PROBABLE LIABILITIES AND ASSOCIATED EXPENSES AND RECEIVABLES, AND

WHETHER IT IS ABLE TO ESTIMATE A LIABILITY PREVIOUSLY DETERMINED TO BE NOT

ESTIMABLE AND/OR NOT PROBABLE. WHERE APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANY MAKES ADDITIONS

TO OR ADJUSTMENTS OF ITS ESTIMATED LIABILITIES. AS A RESULT, THE CURRENT

ESTIMATES OF THE POTENTIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS FOR THE LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND

CLAIMS PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY COULD CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES INSURANCE RECEIVABLES BASED ON AN ANALYSIS OF ITS

NUMEROUS POLICIES, INCLUDING THEIR EXCLUSIONS, PERTINENT CASE LAW INTERPRETING

COMPARABLE POLICIES, ITS EXPERIENCE WITH SIMILAR CLAIMS, AND ASSESSMENT OF THE

NATURE OF THE CLAIM, AND RECORDS AN AMOUNT IT HAS CONCLUDED IS LIKELY TO BE

RECOVERED.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS

THE MAJOR CATEGORIES OF ON-GOING LITIGATION,

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION AND OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES FOR WHICH THE

COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE TO ESTIMATE ITS PROBABLE LIABILITY AND FOR WHICH THE

COMPANY HAS TAKEN RESERVES AND THE RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

FOR THOSE

SIGNIFICANT PENDING LEGAL PROCEEDINGS THAT DO NOT APPEAR IN THE TABLE AND THAT

ARE NOT THE SUBJECT OF PENDING SETTLEMENT AGREEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS

DETERMINED THAT

LIABILITY IS NOT PROBABLE OR

THE AMOUNT OF THE LIABILITY IS NOT ESTIMABLE, OR BOTH, AND THE COMPANY

IS

UNABLE TO ESTIMATE THE POSSIBLE LOSS OR RANGE OF LOSS AT THIS TIME. THE AMOUNTS

IN THE PRECEDING TABLE WITH RESPECT TO BREAST IMPLANT AND ENVIRONMENTAL

REMEDIATION REPRESENT THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE RESPECTIVE

LIABILITIES. THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY SINGLE BEST

ESTIMATE OF THE RESPIRATOR/MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITY OR THE OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITIES SHOWN ABOVE, NOR THAT IT CAN RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OR RANGE

OF AMOUNTS BY WHICH THOSE LIABILITIES MAY EXCEED THE RESERVES THE COMPANY HAS

ESTABLISHED.

BREAST IMPLANT INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

IN THE BREAST IMPLANT INSURANCE COVERAGE

LITIGATION, THE DISTRICT COURT IN RAMSEY COUNTY MINNESOTA ENTERED AN ORDER IN SEPTEMBER 2007

DISMISSING FROM THE SUIT THE LAST OF THE INSURERS THAT WERE STILL CONTESTING

THE EXTENT OF THEIR COVERAGE FOR THE COMPANYS BREAST IMPLANT PRODUCT LIABILITY

CLAIMS. THE DISMISSAL WAS PURSUANT TO A SETTLEMENT THE COMPANY REACHED WITH

THOSE INSURERS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2007. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007,

THE COMPANY HAD RECEIVABLES FOR INSURANCE RECOVERIES RELATED TO THE BREAST

IMPLANT MATTER OF $64 MILLION. THE COMPANY RECEIVED $29 MILLION IN 2007,

REDUCING THIS RECEIVABLE BY THAT AMOUNT. THE COMPANY ALSO RECEIVED $48 MILLION

IN JANUARY 2008 AND EXPECTS TO RECEIVE AN ADDITIONAL $10 MILLION BY THE

END OF 2008 PURSUANT TO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT WITH THREE INSURERS. THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO PURSUE RECOVERY AGAINST ITS REMAINING INSURERS AND EXPECTS TO

COLLECT THE REMAINING RECEIVABLE.

RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLES.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES ITS RESPIRATOR

MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITIES, INCLUDING THE COST TO RESOLVE THE CLAIM AND DEFENSE

COSTS, BY EXAMINING: (I) THE COMPANYS EXPERIENCE IN RESOLVING CLAIMS, (II) APPARENT

TRENDS, (III) THE APPARENT QUALITY OF CLAIMS (

E.G.,

WHETHER THE CLAIM HAS BEEN ASSERTED

ON

BEHALF OF ASYMPTOMATIC CLAIMANTS

), (IV) CHANGES IN THE NATURE AND

MIX OF CLAIMS (

E.G.,

THE PROPORTION OF CLAIMS

ASSERTING USAGE OF THE COMPANYS MASK OR RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS AND ALLEGING

EXPOSURE TO EACH OF ASBESTOS, SILICA, COAL OR OTHER OCCUPATIONAL DUSTS, AND

CLAIMS PLEADING USE OF ASBESTOS-CONTAINING PRODUCTS ALLEGEDLY MANUFACTURED BY

THE COMPANY), (V) THE NUMBER OF CURRENT CLAIMS AND A PROJECTION OF THE

NUMBER OF FUTURE ASBESTOS AND OTHER CLAIMS THAT MAY BE FILED AGAINST THE

COMPANY, (VI) THE COST TO RESOLVE RECENTLY SETTLED CLAIMS, AND (VII) AN

ESTIMATE OF THE COST TO RESOLVE AND DEFEND AGAINST CURRENT AND FUTURE CLAIMS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT DIFFICULTY IN PROJECTING THE NUMBER OF CLAIMS THAT HAVE

NOT YET BEEN ASSERTED, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE COMPANYS RESPIRATORY

PRODUCTS THAT THEMSELVES DID NOT CONTAIN ANY HARMFUL MATERIALS (WHICH MAKES THE

VARIOUS PUBLISHED STUDIES THAT PURPORT TO PROJECT FUTURE ASBESTOS CLAIMS

SUBSTANTIALLY REMOVED FROM THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXPERIENCE AND WHICH

THEMSELVES VARY WIDELY), THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ANY SINGLE

BEST ESTIMATE OF THIS LIABILITY, NOR THAT IT CAN RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT

OR RANGE OF AMOUNTS BY WHICH THE LIABILITY MAY EXCEED THE RESERVE THE COMPANY

HAS ESTABLISHED.

NO LIABILITY HAS BEEN

RECORDED REGARDING

THE PENDING ACTION BROUGHT BY THE WEST VIRGINIA

ATTORNEY GENERAL PREVIOUSLY DESCRIBED.

DEVELOPMENTS

MAY OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS ESTIMATE OF ITS LIABILITIES. THESE

DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN (I) THE

NUMBER OF FUTURE CLAIMS, (II) THE AVERAGE COST OF RESOLVING CLAIMS, (III) THE

LEGAL COSTS OF DEFENDING THESE CLAIMS AND IN MAINTAINING TRIAL READINESS, (IV) CHANGES

IN THE MIX AND NATURE OF CLAIMS RECEIVED, (V) TRIAL AND APPELLATE

OUTCOMES, (VI) CHANGES IN THE LAW AND PROCEDURE APPLICABLE TO THESE

CLAIMS, AND (VII) THE FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER CO-DEFENDANTS AND

INSURERS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANYS RECEIVABLE FOR INSURANCE

RECOVERIES RELATED TO THE RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LITIGATION WAS $332 MILLION.

VARIOUS FACTORS COULD AFFECT THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF RECOVERY OF THIS

RECEIVABLE, INCLUDING (I) DELAYS IN OR AVOIDANCE OF PAYMENT BY INSURERS; (II) THE

EXTENT TO WHICH INSURERS MAY BECOME INSOLVENT IN THE FUTURE, AND (III) THE

OUTCOME OF NEGOTIATIONS WITH INSURERS AND LEGAL PROCEEDINGS WITH RESPECT TO

RESPIRATOR MASK/ASBESTOS LIABILITY INSURANCE COVERAGE. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE ACCRUED LIABILITY AND INSURANCE RECEIVABLE REPRESENTS IN PART THE TIME

DELAY BETWEEN PAYMENT OF CLAIMS ON THE ONE HAND AND RECEIPT OF INSURANCE

REIMBURSEMENTS ON THE OTHER HAND. BECAUSE OF THE LAG TIME BETWEEN SETTLEMENT

AND PAYMENT OF A CLAIM, NO MEANINGFUL CONCLUSIONS MAY BE DRAWN FROM QUARTERLY

CHANGES IN THE AMOUNT OF RECEIVABLES FOR EXPECTED INSURANCE RECOVERIES AND THE

QUARTERLY CHANGES IN THE NUMBER OF CLAIMANTS AT THE END OF EACH QUARTER.

ON JANUARY 5, 2007 THE COMPANY WAS SERVED WITH A DECLARATORY

JUDGMENT ACTION FILED ON BEHALF OF TWO OF ITS INSURERS (CONTINENTAL CASUALTY

AND CONTINENTAL INSURANCE CO.) DISCLAIMING COVERAGE FOR RESPIRATOR/MASK CLAIMS.

THE ACTION WAS FILED IN HENNEPIN COUNTY, MINNESOTA AND NAMES, IN ADDITION TO

THE COMPANY, OVER 60 OF THE COMPANYS INSURERS. THIS ACTION IS SIMILAR IN

NATURE TO AN ACTION FILED IN 1994 WITH RESPECT TO BREAST IMPLANT COVERAGE,

WHICH ULTIMATELY RESULTED IN THE MINNESOTA SUPREME COURTS RULING OF 2003 THAT

WAS LARGELY IN THE COMPANYS FAVOR. AT THE COMPANYS REQUEST, THE CASE WAS

TRANSFERRED TO RAMSEY COUNTY, OVER THE OBJECTIONS OF THE INSURERS. THE

MINNESOTA SUPREME COURT AGREED TO HEAR THE INSURERS APPEAL OF THAT DECISION.

ORAL ARGUMENT ON THE APPEAL IS SCHEDULED FOR MARCH 2008.

ENVIRONMENTAL AND OTHER LIABILITIES AND INSURANCE

RECEIVABLES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD RECORDED

LIABILITIES OF $37 MILLION FOR ESTIMATED ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS BASED

UPON AN EVALUATION OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FACTS WITH RESPECT TO EACH INDIVIDUAL

SITE AND ALSO RECORDED RELATED INSURANCE RECEIVABLES OF $15 MILLION. THE

COMPANY RECORDS LIABILITIES FOR REMEDIATION COSTS ON AN UNDISCOUNTED BASIS WHEN

THEY ARE PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, GENERALLY NO LATER THAN THE

COMPLETION OF FEASIBILITY STUDIES OR THE COMPANYS COMMITMENT TO A PLAN OF

ACTION. LIABILITIES FOR ESTIMATED COSTS OF ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION, DEPENDING

ON THE SITE, ARE BASED PRIMARILY UPON INTERNAL OR THIRD-PARTY ENVIRONMENTAL

STUDIES, AND ESTIMATES AS TO THE NUMBER, PARTICIPATION LEVEL AND FINANCIAL

VIABILITY OF ANY OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES, THE EXTENT OF THE

CONTAMINATION AND THE NATURE OF REQUIRED REMEDIAL ACTIONS. THE COMPANY ADJUSTS

RECORDED LIABILITIES AS FURTHER INFORMATION DEVELOPS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT IT WILL PAY THE AMOUNTS RECORDED OVER THE PERIODS OF

REMEDIATION FOR THE APPLICABLE SITES, CURRENTLY RANGING UP TO 30 YEARS.

79

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE COMPANY HAD RECORDED LIABILITIES OF

$147 MILLION FOR ESTIMATED OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES BASED UPON AN

EVALUATION OF CURRENTLY AVAILABLE FACTS.

AS PREVIOUSLY REPORTED, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS

OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES BY $121 MILLION IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007 AS

A RESULT OF REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS IN MINNESOTA AND THE COMPLETION OF A

COMPREHENSIVE REVIEW WITH ENVIRONMENTAL CONSULTANTS REGARDING ITS OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL

LIABILITIES WHICH INCLUDE

THE ESTIMATED

COSTS OF ADDRESSING TRACE AMOUNTS OF PERFLUORINATED COMPOUNDS IN DRINKING WATER

SOURCES IN THE CITY OF OAKDALE AND LAKE ELMO, MINNESOTA, AS WELL AS PRESENCE IN

THE SOIL AND GROUNDWATER AT THE COMPANYS MANUFACTURING FACILITIES IN DECATUR,

ALABAMA, AND COTTAGE GROVE, MINNESOTA, AND AT TWO FORMER DISPOSAL SITES IN

MINNESOTA.

THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT MOST OF THE SPENDING WILL OCCUR OVER

THE NEXT THREE TO SEVEN YEARS.

WHILE THE

COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO ESTIMATE THE TOTAL COSTS OF IMPLEMENTING THE SETTLEMENT

AGREEMENT AND CONSENT ORDER WITH THE MPCA (

DESCRIBED ABOVE UNDER

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND LITIGATION - REGULATORY MATTERS

), THE

COMPANY INCREASED ITS OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES BY AN ADDITIONAL $13

MILLION IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2007 TO REFLECT ITS BEST ESTIMATE OF THE

SPECIFIC PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS UNDER THAT AGREEMENT.

IT

IS DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE THE COST OF ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND REMEDIATION

GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE INTERPRETATION AND ENFORCEMENT OF

APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE EXTENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL

CONTAMINATION AND THE EXISTENCE OF ALTERNATE CLEANUP METHODS. DEVELOPMENTS MAY

OCCUR THAT COULD AFFECT THE COMPANYS CURRENT ASSESSMENT, INCLUDING, BUT NOT

LIMITED TO: (I) CHANGES IN THE INFORMATION AVAILABLE REGARDING THE

ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS AND PRODUCTS; (II) CHANGES

IN ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS, CHANGES IN PERMISSIBLE LEVELS OF SPECIFIC

COMPOUNDS IN DRINKING WATER SOURCES, OR CHANGES IN ENFORCEMENT THEORIES AND

POLICIES, INCLUDING EFFORTS TO RECOVER NATURAL RESOURCE DAMAGES; (III) NEW

AND EVOLVING ANALYTICAL AND REMEDIATION TECHNIQUES; (IV) SUCCESS IN

ALLOCATING LIABILITY TO OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES; AND (V) THE

FINANCIAL VIABILITY OF OTHER POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND THIRD-PARTY

INDEMNITORS.

NOTE 14.

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS AND STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS

THE COMPANY SPONSORS EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS UNDER SECTION 401(K) OF

THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE. THESE PLANS ARE OFFERED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL REGULAR

U.S. EMPLOYEES. EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS OF UP TO 6% OF COMPENSATION ARE MATCHED

AT RATES RANGING FROM 35% TO 50%, WITH ADDITIONAL COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS

DEPENDING UPON COMPANY PERFORMANCE. ALL COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS INITIALLY ARE

INVESTED IN 3M COMMON STOCK, WITH EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS INVESTED IN A NUMBER

OF INVESTMENT FUNDS PURSUANT TO THEIR ELECTIONS. VESTED EMPLOYEES MAY DIVERSIFY

THEIR 3M SHARES INTO OTHER INVESTMENT OPTIONS.

THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLAN (ESOP). THIS PLAN

WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1989 AS A COST-EFFECTIVE WAY OF FUNDING THE MAJORITY OF THE

COMPANYS CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER 401(K) EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS. TOTAL ESOP

SHARES ARE CONSIDERED TO BE SHARES OUTSTANDING FOR EARNINGS PER SHARE

CALCULATIONS.

DIVIDENDS

ON SHARES HELD BY THE ESOP ARE PAID TO THE ESOP TRUST AND, TOGETHER WITH

COMPANY CONTRIBUTIONS, ARE USED BY THE ESOP TO REPAY PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ON

THE OUTSTANDING ESOP DEBT. THE TAX BENEFIT RELATED TO DIVIDENDS PAID ON

UNALLOCATED SHARES WAS CHARGED DIRECTLY TO EQUITY AND TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $3

MILLION IN 2007, $3 MILLION IN 2006, AND $4 MILLION IN 2005. OVER THE LIFE

OF THE ESOP DEBT, SHARES ARE RELEASED FOR ALLOCATION TO PARTICIPANTS BASED ON

THE RATIO OF THE CURRENT YEARS DEBT SERVICE TO THE REMAINING DEBT SERVICE

PRIOR TO THE CURRENT PAYMENT.

THE

ESOP HAS BEEN THE PRIMARY FUNDING SOURCE FOR THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEE SAVINGS

PLANS. AS PERMITTED BY AICPA STATEMENT OF POSITION 93-6, EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING

FOR EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS, THE COMPANY HAS ELECTED TO CONTINUE ITS

PRACTICES, WHICH ARE BASED ON STATEMENT OF POSITION 76-3, ACCOUNTING PRACTICES

FOR CERTAIN EMPLOYEE STOCK OWNERSHIP PLANS AND SUBSEQUENT CONSENSUS OF THE

EITF OF THE FASB. ACCORDINGLY, THE DEBT OF THE ESOP IS RECORDED AS DEBT, AND

SHARES PLEDGED AS COLLATERAL ARE REPORTED AS UNEARNED COMPENSATION IN THE

CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET AND CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN

STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AND COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. UNEARNED COMPENSATION IS REDUCED

SYMMETRICALLY AS THE ESOP MAKES PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS ON THE DEBT. EXPENSES

RELATED TO THE ESOP INCLUDE TOTAL DEBT SERVICE ON THE NOTES, LESS DIVIDENDS.

THE COMPANY CONTRIBUTES TREASURY SHARES, ACCOUNTED FOR AT FAIR VALUE, TO

EMPLOYEE SAVINGS PLANS TO COVER OBLIGATIONS NOT FUNDED BY THE ESOP (REPORTED AS

AN EMPLOYEE BENEFIT EXPENSE).

(MSOP) AND GENERAL EMPLOYEES STOCK PURCHASE PLAN (GESPP)

THE COMPANY ISSUES

MSOP OPTIONS TO ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES ANNUALLY IN MAY USING THE CLOSING STOCK

PRICE ON THE GRANT DATE, WHICH IS THE DATE OF THE ANNUAL STOCKHOLDERS MEETING.

IN MAY 2005, SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED 36.75 MILLION SHARES FOR ISSUANCE UNDER

THE MSOP IN THE FORM OF MANAGEMENT STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS AND STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS. UNDER THE PLAN, THE COMPANY HAS

PRINCIPALLY ISSUED STOCK OPTIONS TO MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES THAT ARE GRANTED AT

MARKET VALUE ON THE DATE OF GRANT.

PRIOR TO

2005, UNDER PREVIOUS PLANS, THESE OPTIONS WERE GENERALLY EXERCISABLE ONE YEAR

AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT, WITH EXPIRATION 10 YEARS FROM THE DATE OF GRANT.

EFFECTIVE WITH THE MAY 2005 GRANT, THE COMPANY CHANGED ITS VESTING PERIOD

FROM ONE TO THREE YEARS WITH THE EXPIRATION DATE REMAINING AT 10 YEARS FROM

DATE OF GRANT.

IN ADDITION TO GRANTS TO MANAGEMENT EMPLOYEES, THE

COMPANY MAKES OTHER MINOR STOCK OPTION GRANTS TO EMPLOYEES, FOR WHICH VESTING

TERMS AND OPTION LIVES ARE NOT SUBSTANTIALLY DIFFERENT, AND ALSO MAKES MINOR

GRANTS OF RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND OTHER STOCK-BASED GRANTS.

OUTSTANDING SHARES UNDER OPTION INCLUDE GRANTS FROM PREVIOUS PLANS.

THERE WERE APPROXIMATELY 15,400 PARTICIPANTS IN THE PLAN WITH EITHER

OUTSTANDING OPTIONS OR RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007.

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACTUAL LIFE WAS 57 MONTHS AND THE AGGREGATE

INTRINSIC VALUE WAS $1.042 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THERE WAS

$118 MILLION OF COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAT HAS YET TO BE RECOGNIZED RELATED TO

NON-VESTED STOCK OPTION-BASED AWARDS. THIS EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED

OVER THE REMAINING VESTING PERIOD WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIFE OF 18 MONTHS.

THE TOTAL INTRINSIC VALUES OF STOCK OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2007, 2006 AND

2005, RESPECTIVELY, WAS $373 MILLION, $289 MILLION AND $278 MILLION. CASH

RECEIVED FROM OPTIONS EXERCISED DURING 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, WAS

$692 MILLION, $414 MILLION AND $437 MILLION.

THE COMPANYS

ACTUAL TAX BENEFITS REALIZED FOR THE TAX DEDUCTIONS RELATED TO THE EXERCISE OF

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTIONS FOR 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY, WAS $122 MILLION,

$93 MILLION AND $95 MILLION. THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE A SPECIFIC POLICY TO REPURCHASE

COMMON SHARES TO MITIGATE THE DILUTIVE IMPACT OF OPTIONS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY

HAS HISTORICALLY MADE ADEQUATE DISCRETIONARY PURCHASES, BASED ON CASH

AVAILABILITY, MARKET TRENDS AND OTHER FACTORS, TO SATISFY STOCK OPTION EXERCISE

ACTIVITY.

BEGINNING

IN 2007, THE COMPANY BEGAN REDUCING THE NUMBER OF TRADITIONAL STOCK OPTIONS

GRANTED UNDER ITS LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN BY REDUCING THE NUMBER

OF EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ANNUAL GRANTS AND BY SHIFTING A

81

PORTION OF THE ANNUAL

GRANT AWAY FROM TRADITIONAL STOCK OPTIONS PRIMARILY TO RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS.

THESE CHANGES WILL REDUCE THE ANNUAL DILUTION IMPACT FROM 1.5% OF TOTAL

OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK TO ABOUT 1%. HOWEVER, ASSOCIATED WITH THE REDUCTION IN

THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES, THE COMPANY PROVIDED A ONE-TIME BUYOUT

GRANT TO THE IMPACTED EMPLOYEES, WHICH RESULTED IN INCREASED STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN 2007. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES MSOP RESTRICTED

THIS EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING VESTING PERIOD

WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE LIFE OF 39 MONTHS. THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF RESTRICTED

STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS THAT VESTED DURING THE TWELVE-MONTH PERIODS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006 WAS $6 MILLION AND $5 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION, THE

COMPANY ISSUES CASH SETTLED RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS AND STOCK APPRECIATION

RIGHTS IN CERTAIN COUNTRIES. THESE GRANTS DO NOT RESULT IN THE ISSUANCE OF

COMMON STOCK AND ARE CONSIDERED IMMATERIAL BY THE COMPANY.

THE

REMAINING TOTAL MSOP SHARES AVAILABLE FOR GRANT UNDER THE 2005 MSOP PROGRAM ARE

4,408,083, 13,074,202 AND 24,937,892, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007,

2006 AND 2005. RESTRICTED STOCK AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS, PER THE 2005 MSOP

PROGRAM, SHALL BE COUNTED AGAINST THE TOTAL SHARES AVAILABLE AS 2.45 SHARES FOR

EVERY ONE SHARE ISSUED IN CONNECTION WITH THAT AWARD.

EFFECTIVE WITH THE MAY 2005

(RELOAD) OPTIONS; HOWEVER, WHEN A PROGRESSIVE OPTION IS ISSUED UPON THE

EXERCISE OF A PRE-MAY 2005 NON-QUALIFIED STOCK OPTION, THE OPTION IS

REVALUED AND ADDITIONAL STOCK COMPENSATION EXPENSE IS INCURRED.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE

OTHER THINGS, ITS VOLATILITY AND EXPECTED TERM ASSUMPTIONS. EXPECTED VOLATILITY

IS A STATISTICAL MEASURE OF THE AMOUNT BY WHICH A STOCK PRICE IS EXPECTED TO

FLUCTUATE DURING A PERIOD. FOR THE 2007, 2006 AND 2005 ANNUAL GRANT DATE, THE

COMPANY ESTIMATED THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY BASED UPON THE AVERAGE OF THE MOST

RECENT ONE YEAR VOLATILITY, THE MEDIAN OF THE TERM OF THE EXPECTED LIFE ROLLING

VOLATILITY, THE MEDIAN OF THE MOST RECENT TERM OF THE EXPECTED LIFE VOLATILITY

OF 3M STOCK, AND THE IMPLIED VOLATILITY ON THE GRANT DATE. THE EXPECTED TERM

ASSUMPTION IS BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE OF HISTORICAL GRANTS AND ASSUMING

THAT OPTIONS OUTSTANDING ARE EXERCISED AT THE MIDPOINT OF THE FUTURE REMAINING

TERM.

82

AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED, THE COMPANY EXPANDED ITS UTILIZATION OF

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE MAY 2007 MSOP ANNUAL GRANT.

THE MAY 2007 ANNUAL RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT DOES NOT ACCRUE DIVIDENDS

DURING THE VESTING PERIOD AND VESTS OVER THREE YEARS. THE 2007 ONE-TIME

BUYOUT RESTRICTED STOCK UNIT GRANT VESTS OVER FIVE YEARS.

PLAN. PARTICIPANTS ARE GRANTED OPTIONS AT 85% OF MARKET VALUE AT THE DATE OF

GRANT. THERE ARE NO GESPP SHARES UNDER OPTION AT THE BEGINNING OR END OF EACH

MSOP / GESPP STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE.

THE IMPACT OF STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION ON NET INCOME AND EARNINGS PER SHARE PROVIDED BELOW FOR THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2005, WAS RECOGNIZED OVER THE NOMINAL VESTING PERIOD,

WHEREBY IF AN EMPLOYEE RETIRED BEFORE THE END OF THE VESTING PERIOD, THE

COMPANY WOULD RECOGNIZE ANY REMAINING UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST AT THE

DATE OF RETIREMENT. SFAS NO. 123R REQUIRES RECOGNITION UNDER A

NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING PERIOD APPROACH, REQUIRING COMPENSATION EXPENSE

RECOGNITION WHEN AN EMPLOYEE IS ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE. 3M EMPLOYEES IN THE UNITED

STATES ARE ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE BEGINNING AT AGE 55 AND AFTER HAVING COMPLETED

FIVE YEARS OF SERVICE. APPROXIMATELY 25% OF THE NUMBER OF STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

AWARDS ARE MADE TO THIS POPULATION. THE COMPANY CHANGED TO THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE

VESTING PERIOD APPROACH FOR NEW STOCK COMPENSATION GRANTS MADE AFTER THE

COMPANYS ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R ON JANUARY 1, 2006. THEREFORE,

PRIMARILY BEGINNING IN MAY 2006 WITH THE ANNUAL MSOP GRANT, IMMEDIATE

EXPENSING OF THOSE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION AWARDS GRANTED TO EMPLOYEES

ELIGIBLE TO RETIRE RESULTED IN HIGHER COMPENSATION EXPENSE THAN HISTORICALLY

RECOGNIZED IN COMPARABLE PRIOR PERIODS. CAPITALIZED STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

AMOUNTS WERE NOT MATERIAL FOR 2007, 2006 AND 2005. THE INCOME TAX BENEFITS CAN

FLUCTUATE BY PERIOD DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS (ISO)

EXERCISED SINCE THE COMPANY RECEIVES THE ISO TAX BENEFIT UPON EXERCISE. THE

COMPANY LAST GRANTED ISOS IN 2002. AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

16.  BUSINESS SEGMENTS

EFFECTIVE

IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2007, 3M MADE CERTAIN CHANGES TO ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS

IN ITS CONTINUING EFFORT TO DRIVE GROWTH BY ALIGNING BUSINESSES AROUND MARKETS

AND CUSTOMERS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE CHANGES ARE SUMMARIZED AS FOLLOWS.

·

3MS NEW EMERGING BUSINESS OPPORTUNITY IN ITS TRACK AND TRACE

INITIATIVE RESULTED IN THE MERGING OF A NUMBER OF FORMERLY SEPARATE EFFORTS

INTO ONE CONCERTED EFFORT FOR FUTURE GROWTH. TRACK AND TRACE HAS A GROWING

ARRAY OF APPLICATIONS  FROM TRACKING PACKAGES TO MANAGING MEDICAL AND LEGAL

RECORDS. THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THIS NEW INITIATIVE WITHIN 3MS SAFETY, SECURITY

AND PROTECTION SERVICES SEGMENT RESULTED IN THE TRANSFER OF CERTAIN BUSINESSES

TO THIS SEGMENT FROM OTHER SEGMENTS, INCLUDING THE TRANSFER OF HIGHJUMP

SOFTWARE INC., A 3M U.S.-BASED SUBSIDIARY THAT PROVIDES SUPPLY CHAIN EXECUTION

SOFTWARE AND SOLUTIONS (INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT) AND THE TRANSFER

OF CERTAIN TRACK AND TRACE PRODUCTS FROM THE ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS

SEGMENT.

·

3MS VISUAL SYSTEMS BUSINESS (CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENT), WHICH

OFFERS ANALOG OVERHEAD AND ELECTRONIC PROJECTORS AND FILM, WAS TRANSFERRED TO

THE ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT. THIS TRANSFER IS INTENDED TO LEVERAGE

COMMON MARKETS, CUSTOMERS, SUPPLIERS AND TECHNOLOGIES.

·

3MS INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT (ENERGY AND ADVANCED

MATERIALS BUSINESS) TRANSFERRED THE 3M ALUMINUM CONDUCTOR COMPOSITE REINFORCED

(ACCR) ELECTRICAL POWER CABLE TO THE ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT

(ELECTRICAL MARKETS BUSINESS). WITH AN ALUMINUM-BASED METAL MATRIX AT ITS CORE,

THE ACCR PRODUCT INCREASES TRANSMISSION CAPACITY FOR EXISTING POWER LINES. THE

ELECTRICAL MARKETS BUSINESS SELLS INSULATING, TESTING AND CONNECTING PRODUCTS

TO VARIOUS MARKETS, INCLUDING THE ELECTRIC UTILITY MARKETS.

·

CERTAIN ADHESIVES AND TAPES IN THE INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION

SEGMENT (INDUSTRIAL ADHESIVES AND TAPES BUSINESS) WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE

CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENT (PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE CONSTRUCTION AND HOME

IMPROVEMENT BUSINESS AND THE STATIONERY PRODUCTS BUSINESS) AND TO THE ELECTRO

AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT (ELECTRONICS MARKETS MATERIALS BUSINESS). CERTAIN

MAINTENANCE-FREE RESPIRATOR PRODUCTS FOR THE CONSUMER MARKET IN 3MS SAFETY,

SECURITY AND PROTECTION SERVICES SEGMENT WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE CONSUMER AND

OFFICE SEGMENT (CONSTRUCTION AND HOME IMPROVEMENT BUSINESS).

·

3M TRANSFERRED FILM MANUFACTURING AND SUPPLY CHAIN OPERATIONS, A

RESOURCE FOR THE MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT OF FILMS AND MATERIALS, TO THE

DISPLAY AND GRAPHICS BUSINESS FROM CORPORATE AND UNALLOCATED.

THE FINANCIAL INFORMATION

PRESENTED HEREIN REFLECTS THE IMPACT OF ALL OF THE PRECEDING CHANGES FOR ALL

PERIODS PRESENTED.

3MS BUSINESSES ARE

ORGANIZED, MANAGED AND INTERNALLY GROUPED INTO SEGMENTS BASED ON DIFFERENCES IN

PRODUCTS, TECHNOLOGIES AND SERVICES.

3M

CONTINUES TO MANAGE ITS OPERATIONS IN SIX OPERATING BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

INDUSTRIAL AND TRANSPORTATION SEGMENT, HEALTH CARE SEGMENT, DISPLAY AND

GRAPHICS SEGMENT, CONSUMER AND OFFICE SEGMENT, SAFETY, SECURITY AND PROTECTION

SERVICES SEGMENT AND ELECTRO AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT. 3MS SIX BUSINESS

SEGMENTS BRING TOGETHER COMMON OR RELATED 3M TECHNOLOGIES, ENHANCING THE

DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND PROVIDING FOR EFFICIENT

SHARING OF BUSINESS RESOURCES. THESE SEGMENTS HAVE WORLDWIDE RESPONSIBILITY FOR

VIRTUALLY ALL 3M PRODUCT LINES.

3M IS NOT DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE

PRODUCT OR MARKET.

CERTAIN SMALL BUSINESSES

AND LAB-SPONSORED PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS VARIOUS CORPORATE ASSETS AND EXPENSES,

ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

TRANSACTIONS AMONG

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE RECORDED AT COST. 3M IS AN INTEGRATED ENTERPRISE

CHARACTERIZED BY SUBSTANTIAL INTERSEGMENT COOPERATION, COST ALLOCATIONS AND

INVENTORY TRANSFERS. THEREFORE, MANAGEMENT DOES NOT REPRESENT THAT THESE

SEGMENTS, IF OPERATED INDEPENDENTLY, WOULD REPORT THE OPERATING INCOME AND

OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION SHOWN. THE ALLOCATIONS RESULTING FROM THE SHARED

UTILIZATION OF ASSETS ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE UNDERLYING ACTIVITY

FOR SEGMENT ASSETS, DEPRECIATION AND AMORTIZATION, AND CAPITAL EXPENDITURES.
