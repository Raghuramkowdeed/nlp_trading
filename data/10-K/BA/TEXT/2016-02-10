international space station. this segment also includes our joint venture operations related to united launch alliance. global services& support segmentthis segment provides customers with mission readiness through total support solutions. our global services business sustains aircraft and systems with a full spectrum of products and services through integrated logistics, including supply chain management and engineering support; maintenance, modification and upgrades for aircraft; and training systems and government services, including pilot and maintenance training. gs&s international operations include boeing defence u.k. ltd., and boeing defence australia, as well as alsalam aircraft company, aviation training international, ltd and boeing sikorsky international services llc, joint ventures.integrated logistics comprises an integrated array of services that address the complete life cycle of aircraft and systems. major programs supported include the f/a-18e/f, f-15, ah-64 apache and ch-47 chinook for domestic and international customers.aircraft modernization and sustainment is performed at centers throughout the united states and around the world, providing rapid cycle time and aircraft services for military customers on a wide variety of bds and non-bds platforms. major support is performed as part of the c-17 globemaster iii integrated sustainment program. aircraft programs include the airborne early warningand control (aew&c) peace eagle contract with turkey and airborne warning and control systems (awacs) program. we delivered the final aew&c aircraft to turkey in 2015. training systems and government services comprise a full range of training capabilities for domestic and international customers, including the design and development of trainers for multiple aircraft platforms and logistics and asset management solutions.boeing capital segmentbcc seeks to ensure that boeing customers have the financing they need to buy and take delivery of their boeing product and manages overall financing exposure. bccs portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments. 2table of contentsfinancial and other business informationsee the summary of business segment data and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information, including revenues and earnings from operations, for each of our business segments.intellectual propertywe own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. in addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. for example, the u.s. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. while our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.non-u.s. revenuessee note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding non-u.s. revenues.research and developmentresearch and development expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative jet aircraft including both commercial and military, advanced space and other company-sponsored product development. these are expensed as incurred including amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on u.s. government contracts.our total research and development expense, net amounted to $3.3 billion, $3.0 billion and $3.1 billion in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.research and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, as well as costs incurred in excess of amounts estimated to be recoverable under cost-sharing research and development agreements. bid and proposal costs were $286 million, $289 million and $285 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.3table of contentsemployeestotal workforce level at december31, 2015 was approximately 161,400. as of december31, 2015, our principal collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions:unionpercentofour employees representedstatus of the agreements with major unionthe international association of machinists and aerospace workers (iam)22%we have two major agreements; one expiring in june 2022 and one in september 2024.the society of professional engineering employees in aerospace (speea)13%we have two major agreements expiring in october 2016.the united automobile, aerospace and agricultural implement workers of america (uaw)1%we have one major agreement expiring in october 2022.competitionthe commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. we face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as airbus, embraer and bombardier, and other entrants from russia, china and japan. we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. we intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products, services, and support. we continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which spans the life cycle of the airplane: aircraft acquisition, readying for service, maintenance and engineering, enhancing and upgrading, and transitioning to the next model - as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. this enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.bds faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from lockheed martin corporation, northrop grumman corporation, raytheon company and general dynamics corporation. non-u.s. companies such as bae systems and airbus group, continue to build a strategic presence in the u.s. market by strengthening their north american operations and partnering with u.s. defense companies. in addition, certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. bds expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2016.regulatory mattersour businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. we deal with numerous u.s. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the u.s. military, nasa, the federal aviation administration (faa) and the department of homeland security. similar government authorities exist in our international markets.government contracts. the u.s. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default, based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. if any of our u.s. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. if any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the u.s. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and could require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. the u.s. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.4table of contentscommercial aircraft. in the u.s., our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with faa regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. internationally, similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. these requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of europe, coordinated by the european joint aviation authorities.environmental. we are subject to various federal, state, local and non-u.s. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. we continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. investigation, remediation, and operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. these costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the u.s. government. it is reasonably possible that costs incurred to ensure continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil, air and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.a potentially responsible party (prp) has joint and several liability under existing u.s. environmental laws. where we have been designated a prp by the environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. if we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for which we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other prps. for additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.international. our international sales are subject to u.s. and non-u.s. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. international sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.raw materials, parts, and subassemblieswe are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. the most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take one year or more. many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of companies.supplierswe are dependent upon the ability of a large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. while we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. we are also dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices.5table of contentsseasonalityno material portion of our business is

involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. we urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.our commercial airplanes business depends heavily on commercial airlines, and is subject to unique risks.market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft. the commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. the principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. in addition, availability of financing to non-u.s. customers depends in part on the export-import bank of the united states. significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or in the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. in addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.we enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. in order to account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by price escalation formulas derived from labor, commodity and other price indices. our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our commercial airplanes business.we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. we can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. in addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.our commercial airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.the commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with u.s and non-u.s. suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. in addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 max and 777x, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. as 7table of contentsa result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks.we must meet planned production rate and productivity improvement targets in order to satisfy customer demand and maintain our profitability. we continue to increase production rates for the 737, 767 and 787 programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development of the 787-10, 737 max and 777x aircraft. in addition, we continue to seek opportunities to reduce the costs of building our aircraft, including working with our suppliers to reduce supplier costs, identifying and implementing productivity improvements, and optimizing how we manage inventory. if production rate ramp-up efforts at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the cost and rates necessary to achieve our targets, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins. our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs. further, if we cannot efficiently and cost-effectively incorporate design changes into early build 787 aircraft, we may face further profitability pressures on this program.if our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. these challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. any failure of any boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.changes in levels of u.s. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the u.s. government, primarily from defense related programs with the u.s. dod. levels of u.s. defense spending in future periods are very difficult to predict and subject to significant risks. in addition, significant budgetary delays and constraints have already resulted in reduced spending levels, and additional reductions may be forthcoming. in august 2011, the budget control act (the act) established limits on u.s. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 u.s. government fiscal years. the act also provided that the defense budget would face sequestration cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. the impact of sequestration cuts has been reduced with respect to fy2016 and fy2017 following the enactment of the bipartisan budget act of 2015 in november 2015. however, long-term uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that u.s. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure, including risk of future sequestration cuts.in addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the u.s. dod and other government agencies (including nasa) within the overall budgetary framework described above. while the fy2016 appropriations enacted december 2015 included funding for boeings major programs, such as f/a-18, ch-47 chinook, ah-64 apache, kc-46a tanker and p-8 programs, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in fy2017 and beyond will affect boeings programs. we also expect that ongoing concerns regarding the u.s. national debt will continue to place downward 8table of contentspressure on u.s. dod spending levels. future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorizations and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. in addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both u.s. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the u.s. dod to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. if we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the u.s. dod customer, our revenues and market share would be further impacted.we conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to u.s. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.in 2015, 27% of our revenues were earned pursuant to u.s. government contracts, which include foreign military sales through the u.s. government. business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.our sales to the u.s. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs. new procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our bds business. these requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject to additional costs in the form of withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirements in the future. compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results.the u.s. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. the u.s. government contracting party may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. in addition, funding pursuant to our u.s. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the u.s. congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in u.s. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the u.s. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as continuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position.we are subject to u.s. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under u.s. government contracts. u.s. government agencies, including the defense contract audit agency and the defense contract management agency, routinely audit government contractors. these agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the u.s. government. we also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.9table of contentswe enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.our bds business generated approximately 72% of its 2015 revenues from fixed-price contracts. while fixed-price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. if our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. for example, during the second quarter of 2015, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $835 million on the usaf kc-46a tanker contract, primarily driven by additional costs attributable to design changes, testing and manufacturing complexity. the long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. in addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance.fixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. many of these development programs have highly complex designs. in addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. examples of significant bds fixed-price development contracts include commercial crew, saudi f-15, usaf kc-46a tanker, and commercial and military satellites.we enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks.our bds business generated approximately 28% of its 2015 revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements. some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. these cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise.programs whose contracts are primarily cost-typeinclude gmd, proprietary and sls programs.we enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks.contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. these in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. in both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at riskif the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. the net present value of in-orbit incentive feeswe ultimately expect to realizeis recognized as revenue in the construction period. if the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required toprovide refunds to the customerand incur significant charges.our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components.we rely on other companies including subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. in addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. in some instances, 10table of contentswe depend upon a single source of supply. any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the suppliers control, such as geo-political developments, or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs. for example, we continue to monitor political unrest involving russia and ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. we use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are considered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. suppliers assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards.with respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. a program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. to establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a)the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b)the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c)the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, changes to price escalation indices, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer and supplier negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance.because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. for additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under managements discussion and analysis  critical accounting policies  contract accounting/program accounting on pages 44  45 and note 1 to our consolidated financial statements on pages 55  66 of this form10-k.11table of contentscompetition within our markets and with respect to the products we sell may reduce our future contracts and sales.the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. in our commercial airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-u.s. aircraft manufacturers and service providers in one or more of our market segments. in our bds business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation, fewer large and new programs and new priorities, including near and long-term cost competitiveness, of our u.s. dod and international customers will intensify competition for many of our products and services. furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share.we derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-u.s. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries.in 2015, non-u.s. customers accounted for approximately 59% of our revenues. we expect that non-u.s. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. as a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:changes in regulatory requirements;domestic and international government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements;fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;volatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-u.s. national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders;the complexity and necessity of using non-u.s. representatives and consultants;the uncertainty of the ability of non-u.s. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the export-import bank of the united states;uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes, sanctions and other trade restrictions;the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries;compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as u.s. laws affecting the activities of u.s. companies abroad; andunforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war, epidemics and international conflicts.while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future.the outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.we are involved in a number of litigation matters. these matters may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. no assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. an adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have 12table of contentsa material impact on our financial position and results of operations. in addition, we are subject to extensive regulation under the laws of the united states and its various states, as well as other jurisdictions in which we operate. as a result, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the u.s. government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our current or past ownership of certain property. any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations.a significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers based in the united states, and in certain types of boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks.a significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions, particularly in the united states. our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8f aircraft. if one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected.we may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts.we depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, our airplane financing commitments totaled $16,283 million and $16,723 million. if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for debt. these factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. the occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments.we may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.as part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected by unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. while we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. we also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. these transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.13table of contentsour insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.we are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. we maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the u.s. government. the amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. for example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. while some of these products are shielded from liability within the u.s. under the safety act provisions of the 2002 homeland security act, no such protection is available outside the u.s., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities.business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of boeing and of our products and services.some of our and our suppliers workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages.approximately 61,000 employees, which constitute 38% of our total workforce, were union represented as of december31, 2015. we experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain bma program production. we may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. we cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 11 u.s. labor organizations and 6 non-u.s. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions requirements without impacting our financial condition. the unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. union actions at suppliers can also affect us. work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations.we have substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows from operations and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.we have qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover the majority of our employees. potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the employee retirement income security act and discretionary contributions to improve the plans' funded status. the extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. we estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders' equity. for u.s. government contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on u.s. cost accounting standards which can also affect contract profitability. we also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including 14table of contentsestimates of the level of medical cost increases. for a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see management's discussion and analysis-critical accounting policies-pension plans on pages 46  47 of this form 10-k. although gaap expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans.our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.we are subject to various federal, state, local and non-u.s. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. in some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. in other cases, we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. in addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs. for additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business.we face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms, monitoring systems and management oversight in order to address these threats. while these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks, including cyber-attacks, could result insignificant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. in addition, we manage information technology systems for certain customers. many of these customers face similar security threats. if we cannot prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.item1b. unresolved staff commentsnot applicable15table

commercial airplanes and higher charges of $410 million related to the usaf kc-46a tanker recorded by commercial airplanes and our boeing military aircraft (bma) segment, partially offset by lower unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expense of $1,089 million.earnings from operations in 2014 increased by $911 million compared with 2013 primarily reflecting higher earnings at commercial airplanes of $616 million and lower unallocated items and eliminations of $485 million. the decrease in unallocated items is due to the a-12 litigation settlement of $406 million which was recorded in 2013 and lower 2014 deferred compensation of $194 million. the a-12 aircraft litigation settlement resulted in the company recording a $406 million pre-tax charge in 2013, which consisted of writing-off a-12 inventory, recorded as cost of sales, and providing three ea-18g growlers at no cost to the u.s. navy, recorded as a reduction in revenues.20table of contentsduring the second quarter of 2015 and of 2014, we recorded reach-forward losses of $835 million and $425 million on the usaf kc-46a tanker contract. $513 million of the 2015 charge was recorded at commercial airplanes

aircraft deliveries and expense allocations. the increase of $143 million in 2014 was primarily due to insurance recoveries which were recorded in the third quarter of 2013.litigation settlements include the 2013 charge of $406 million related to the settlement of the a-12 litigation.21table of contentsnet periodic benefit cost related to pension totaled $2,786 million, $2,208 million and $3,449 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. the components of net periodic benefit cost are shown in the following table:pensionyears ended december31,201520142013service

effective income tax rates were 27.7%, 23.7% and 26.4% for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. our 2015 effective tax rate was higher than 2014 primarily due to tax benefits of $524 million recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to tax basis adjustments and settlement of the 2007 - 2010 federal tax audits. our 2014 effective tax rate was lower than 2013 primarily due to the tax benefits of $524 million recorded in the second quarter of 2014. for additional discussion related to income taxes, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.total costs and expenses (cost of sales)cost of sales, for both products and services, consists primarily of raw materials, parts, sub-assemblies, labor, overhead and subcontracting costs. our commercial airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales and bds predominantly uses contract accounting. under program accounting, cost of sales for each commercial airplane program equals the product of (i) revenue recognized in connection with customer deliveries and (ii) the estimated cost of sales percentage applicable to the total remaining program. under contract accounting, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. the following table summarizes cost of

sales as a percentage of revenue was approximately 85.4% in 2015 compared with 84.6% in 2014 primarily driven by the 2015 747 charge and higher kc-46a tanker charges. cost of sales in 2014 increased by $3,484 million, or 5%, compared with the same period in 2013, primarily driven by the increase in revenue. cost of sales at commercial airplanes increased by $6,265 million, or 14%, primarily driven by the 13% increase in revenues. cost of sales at bds decreased by $2,085 million, or 8%, primarily due to the 7% reduction in revenues.research and development the following table summarizes

orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated u.s. and non-u.s. government contract funding. the decrease in contractual backlog at december 31, 2015 compared with december 31, 2014 was primarily due to deliveries in excess of net orders. the increase in contractual backlog at december 31, 2014 compared with december 31, 2013 was primarily due to commercial airplane orders and reclassifications from unobligated backlog related to incremental funding. the increase was partially offset by commercial airplane deliveries and revenues recognized on awarded contracts.unobligated backlog includes u.s. and non-u.s. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. the decreases in unobligated backlog in 2015 and 2014 were primarily due to reclassifications to contractual backlog related to incremental funding for bds contracts, partially offset by contract awards. additional considerationskc-46a tanker in 2011, we were awarded a contract from the u.s. air force (usaf) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver four next generation aerial refueling tankers. the kc-46a tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. this engineering, manufacturing and development (emd) contract is a fixed-price incentive fee contract valued at $4.9 billion andinvolves highly complex designs and systems integration. we have also begun work on low rate initial production (lrip) aircraft for the usaf. the usaf is expected to authorize two low rate initial production lots in 2016 for a total of 19 aircraft, subject to satisfactory progress being made on the emd contract.in second quarter 2014, we recorded a reach-forward loss of $425 million on the emd contract. in second quarter 2015, we recorded an additional reach-forward loss of $835 million. $513 million of this loss was recorded at our commercial airplanes segment and the remaining $322 million was recorded in our bma segment. the $835 million loss includes $670 million related to the emd contract and $165 million related to lrip aircraft. the reach-forward loss on the emd contract was driven primarily by design changes required in the aircraft fuels and aerial refueling systems which were identified as we prepared for and conducted ground and flight testing. other costs include additional qualification and certification testing as well as investments that will enable us to meet our delivery commitments in 2017. the reach-forward 24table of contentsloss related to lrip aircraft was primarily driven by increased manufacturing complexity resulting from design changes. as with any development program, this program remains subject to additional reach-forward losses if we experience technical or quality issues, schedule delays or increased costs. we continue to expect to meet our commitment to deliver 18 fully operational aircraft to the customer by august 2017. the contract contains production options for both lrip aircraft and full rate production aircraft.if all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. russia/ukraine we continue to monitor political unrest involving russia and ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. a number of our commercial customers also have operations in russia and ukraine.to date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries.should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted.export-import bank of the united states many of our non-u.s. customers finance purchases through the export-import bank of the united states. following the expiration of the banks charter on june 30, 2015, the banks charter was reauthorized in december 2015. the bank is now authorized through september 30, 2019. however, until the u.s. senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the banks board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. as a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers. certain of our non-u.s. customers also may seek to delay purchases if they cannot obtain financing at reasonable costs, and there may be further impacts with respect to future sales campaigns involving non-u.s. customers. we continue to work with our customers to mitigate risks associated with the lack of a quorum of the banks board of directors and assist with alternative third party financing sources. segment results of operations and financial conditioncommercial airplanesbusiness environment and trendsairline industry environment global economic activity and global trade, which are the primary drivers of the demand for air travel, grew below the long-term average for the fourth year in a row in 2015. despite this, passenger traffic continued to grow more than 5%, as it has every year since 2010, and accelerated to more than 6% in 2015. while growth was strong across all major world regions, there continues to be significant variation between regions and airline business models. airlines operating in the middle east and asia pacific regions as well as low-cost-carriers globally are currently leading passenger growth. air cargo traffic grew at 5% in the first quarter and 3% in the second quarter of 2015 compared with the same periods in 2014. however, weaker global industrial production and world trade resulted in little to no cargo traffic growth during the remainder of the year. the slowing air cargo market recovery has resulted in reduced orders and demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversions, and in january 2016, we announced plans to further reduce production rates on the 747 program.  airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. airlines are also relentlessly focusing on reducing costs by renewing fleets to leverage more efficient airplanes and in 2015 benefited significantly from lower fuel costs. net profits for the global airline industry are estimated to total $33 billion in 2015 compared to $17 billion in 2014. we expect airline profits to continue to grow in 2016, driven by strong passenger demand and relatively low oil prices.25table of contentsthe long-term outlook for the industry continues to remain positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. our 20-year forecast projects a long-term average growth rate of 4.9%per year for passenger traffic and 4.2% for cargo traffic. based on long-term global economic growth projections of 3.1% average annual gdp growth, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $5.6 trillion market for approximately 38,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years.the industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, epidemics and increased global environmental regulations.industry competitiveness the commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. market liberalization in europe and asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. these airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. this results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. approximately 11% of commercial airplanes contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with u.s. airlines, including cargo carriers. we face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. they offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. with government support, airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. regional jet makers embraer and bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and increasingly capable airplanes. additionally, other competitors from russia, china and japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above 90 seats. many ofthese competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including launch aid, which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated withairplane development activities and enablesairplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. this market environment has resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in u.s. dollars. fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. changes in value of the u.s. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors revenues and profits. many competitors are expected to benefit from the strong u.s. dollar experienced in 2015 and ongoing improvements in efficiency, which may result in funding product development, gaining market share through pricing and/or improving earnings.we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. we continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spare parts, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. this enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. these efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively. 26table of contentsresults of operations(dollars in millions)years ended

accounted for as revenues by commercial airplanes and as operating leases in consolidation identified by parenthesesearnings from operations  earnings from operations in 2015 decreased by $1,254 million or 20% compared with 2014 primarily due to higher reach-forward losses of $1,160 million and higher research and development spending of $459 million, largely on the 777x, which more than offset higher new airplane deliveries and mix. during the fourth quarter of 2015 we recorded a charge of $885 million to recognize a reach-forward loss on the 747 program. in addition, we recorded reach-forward losses on the usaf kc-46a tanker contract of $513 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $238 million in the second quarter of 2014. operating margins in 2015 decreased primarily due to additional reach-forward losses, higher research and development expense and the dilutive impact of 787 volume and mix.earnings from operations in 2014 increased by $616 million or 11% compared with 2013. the increase in earnings is primarily due to higher earnings of $947 million driven by higher new airplane deliveries and commercial aviation services revenue growth. this earnings increase was partially offset by a reach-27table of contentsforward loss of $238 million recorded in the second quarter of 2014 related to the usaf kc-46a tanker contract and higher research and development expense of $74 million. the increase in research and development reflects higher spending on the 777x, 787-10 and 737 max, which more than offset lower 787-9 spending. operating margins decreased from 10.9% in 2013 to 10.7% in 2014 primarily due to the dilutive impact of 747 and 787 deliveries and the usaf kc-46a tanker reach-forward loss.backlog firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their board of directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. all such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. firm orders exclude options. a number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. we continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. however, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers.the decrease in contractual backlog during 2015 was due to deliveries in excess of net orders. the increase in contractual backlog during 2014 was due to net orders in excess of deliveries. the decrease in unobligated backlog during 2015 and 2014 was primarily due to the reclassification from unobligated to contractual backlog related to incremental funding of the existing multi-year contract for commercial airplanes share of the usaf kc-46a tanker contract.accounting quantity the accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. it is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. we review our program accounting quantities quarterly.the accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). in developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.28table of contentsthe following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of december31. cumulative firm orders

under firm orders include a number of aircraft that are being remarketed. program highlights737 program the accounting quantity for the 737 program increased by 600 units during 2015 due to the programs normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. we are currently producing at a rate of 42 per month and plan an additional increase to 47 per month in 2017. we plan to further increase the rate to 52 per month in 2018 and to 57 per month in 2019. first delivery of the 737 max is expected in 2017.747 program lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger and freighter aircraft and slower-than-expected growth of global freight traffic have resulted in market uncertainties, ongoing pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated. during the second half of 2015, the cargo market recovery slowed, and in january 2016, we announced a plan to further reduce the production rate to 0.5 per month as well as recognize a reach-forward loss of $885 million on the program. the charge, which was recorded during the fourth quarter of 2015, is primarily related to lower anticipated revenues reflecting ongoing pricing and market pressures, as well as higher estimated costs due to the reduced production rate. we are currently producing at a rate of 1.3 per month with plans to reduce the rate to 1.0 per month in march 2016, further reduce the rate to 0.5 per month in september 2016 and then return to 1.0 per month in 2019. we have a number of completed aircraft in inventory as well as unsold production positions and we remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. if we are unable to obtain sufficient orders in 2016 and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face an additional reach-forward loss that may be material.767 program the accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 34 units during 2015 due to the program's progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. the 767 assembly line includes a 767 derivative to support the tanker program. we are currently producing at a combined tanker and 29table of contentscommercial production rate of 1.5 per month and plan to increase to 2 per month in 2016. we plan to further increase the rate to 2.5 per month in the fourth quarter of 2017. 777 program the accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 50 units during 2015 due to the programs normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. we are currently producing at a rate of 8.3 per month and plan to reduce the rate to 7 per month in 2017. in the fourth quarter of 2013, we launched the 777x, which features a new composite wing, new engines and folding wing-tips. the 777x will have a separate program accounting quantity, which will be determined in the year of first airplane delivery, targeted for 2020. 787 program we continue to produce at a rate of 10 per month and plan for rate increases to 12 per month in 2016 and 14 per month by the end of the decade. first delivery of the 787-10 derivative aircraft is targeted for 2018. the accounting quantity of 1,300 units remains unchanged. we remain focused on increasing the production rate to 12 per month in 2016 and improving productivity. we continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly for both the 787-8 and 787-9, including management of our manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, as well as completing and delivering early build aircraft. in addition, we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes, including requests for contractual relief related to delivery delays and supplier assertions. during 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. as a result, costs associated with these airplanes were included in research and development expense. based on sales activity and market interest we continue to believe that the remaining 787 flight-test aircraft are commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to these aircraft in program inventory. however, there is risk that we may be unable to sell these aircraft. if we determine that any of the remaining flight-test aircraft cannot be sold, we would incur additional material charges related to the reclassification of costs associated with those aircraft to research and development expense.the combination of production challenges, change incorporation on early build aircraft, schedule delays, customer and supplier impacts and changes to price escalation factors has created significant pressure on program profitability and we continue to have near breakeven gross margins. if risks related to these challenges, together with risks associated with planned production rate increases, or introducing or manufacturing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. we continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks.fleet support we provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. they include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. the costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have historically been approximately 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services.30table of contentsprogram development the following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major commercial airplanes derivatives and programs.reflects models in development during 2015we launched the 787-10 in june 2013 and the 777x in november 2013.additional considerationsthe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. in addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 787-10, 737 max and 777x, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. as a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors due to changes in the inflation rate or other economic indicators, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, achieving anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for new airplanes and derivatives and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. while we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.defense, space& securitybusiness environment and trends united states government defense environment overview the enactment of the bipartisan budget act of 2015 in november 2015 established overall defense spending levels for fy2016 and fy2017. however, uncertainty remains with respect to levels of defense spending for fy2018 and beyond, including risk of future sequestration cuts. significant uncertainty also continues with respect to program-level appropriations for the u.s. department of defense (u.s. dod) and other government agencies, including the national aeronautics and space administration, within the overall budgetary framework described above. future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorization and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. in addition to the risks described above, if congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. for example, requirements to 31table of contentsfurlough employees in the u.s. dod or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on

business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. in these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. examples of these programs include ground-based midcourse defense (gmd), proprietary and space launch system (sls) programs.some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. many of these programs have highly complex designs. as technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. these programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. these programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. examples of significant fixed-price development programs include saudi f-15, usaf kc-46a tanker, commercial crew and commercial and military satellites.33table of contentsboeing military aircraft results of operations(dollars in millions)years ended december31,201520142013revenues$13,482$13,500$15,275% of total company

revenues in 2014 decreased by $1,775 million, or 12%, compared with 2013 primarily due to a reduction of revenue of $1,730 million related to f-15 and usaf kc-46a tanker milestones, fewer c-17 aircraft deliveries and delivery mix on the p-8 program.earnings from operations  bma earnings from operations in 2015 increased by $17 million compared with 2014 primarily due to lower c-17 charges, higher chinook deliveries and higher earnings on the f-15 program, primarily due to a cumulative catch-up adjustment recorded in the third quarter of 2015. these increases were partially offset by higher charges of $135 million on the usaf kc-46a tanker contract and lower earnings on proprietary programs. bma recorded charges of $322 million in the second quarter of 2015 and $187 million in the second quarter of 2014 related to the usaf kc-46a tanker contract. in addition, bma recorded a charge of $48 million in the first quarter of 2014 to write-off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of our decision to produce three fewer c-17 aircraft in 2015 than previously planned. net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $96 million lower in 2015 than

three fewer c-17 aircraft in 2015 than previously planned. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements. these decreases were partially offset by higher earnings of $65 million related to improved performance on the f/a-18 program. in addition, in 2013, we recorded a charge of $64 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of the republic of korea's announcement to restart its f-x fighter aircraft competition. net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $39 million lower in 2014 than in 2013 primarily driven by the reach-forward

december31, 2015 totaled $3,459 million. a substantial portion of bccs portfolio is concentrated among certain u.s. commercial airline customers. bccs portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 and 747-8f aircraft.bcc provided customer financing of $586 million and $489 million during 2015 and 2014. while we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2016, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources.aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. approximately 2,300 western-built commercial jet aircraft (9.5% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2015, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. of these parked aircraft, approximately 11% are not expected to return to service. at the end of 2014 and 2013, 9.8% and 9.2% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of

with $8.9 billion during 2014 and $8.2 billion in 2013. the increase of $0.5 billion in 2015 was primarily due to lower inventory growth, partially offset by lower receipts of advances and progress billings. the increase of $0.7 billion in 2014 was primarily due to higher customer advances which more than offset higher gross inventory. our investment in gross inventories decreased by $0.3 billion in 2015 primarily in our bds business, largely driven by ending production of c-17 aircraft, which more than offset continued investment in commercial airplane program inventory. our investment in gross inventories increased $7.6 billion in 2014 and $5.7 billion in 2013, largely driven by continued investment in commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787 inventory. advances and progress billings increased by $0.4 billion in 2015, $6.9 billion in 2014 and $3.9 billion in 2013, primarily due to payments from commercial airplane customers. discretionary contributions to our pension plans were insignificant in 2015 compared with $0.8 billion in 2014 and $1.5 billion in 2013. investing activities cash used by investing activities was $1.8 billion during 2015 compared with $2.5 billion provided during 2014 and $5.2 billion used during 2013, largely due to changes in investments in time deposits. net proceeds from investments were $0.6 billion in 2015 compared with $4.8 billion in 2014 and net contributions to investments of $2.9 billion in 2013. in 2015, capital expenditures totaled $2.5 billion, up from $2.2 billion in 2014 and $2.1 billion in 2013. we expect capital expenditures in 2016 to be consistent with 2015 due to continued investment to support growth.financing activities cash used by financing activities was $7.9 billion during 2015, a decrease of $0.7 billion compared with 2014 primarily due to higher new borrowings of $0.8 billion and lower repayments of debt and distribution rights of $0.9 billion in 2015, which more than offset higher share repurchases of $0.8 billion and higher dividend payments of $0.4 billion in 2015. cash used by financing activities was $8.6 billion during 2014, an increase of $4.3 billion compared with 2013 primarily due to higher share repurchases of $3.2 billion, higher dividends paid of $0.6 billion and a decrease in proceeds from stock options exercised of $0.8 billion in 2014, partially offset by higher new borrowings of $0.4 billion in 2014. 39table of contentsduring 2015, we issued $1.7 billion and repaid $0.9 billion of debt. at december31, 2015 and 2014 the recorded balance of debt was $10.0 billion and $9.1 billion of which $1.2 billion and $0.9 billion was classified as short-term. at december31, 2015 and 2014 this includes $2.4 billion of debt attributable to bcc, of which $0.5 billion and $0.1 billion was classified as short-term.during 2015 and 2014 we repurchased 46.7 million and 46.6 million shares totaling $6.8 billion and $6.0 billion through our open market share repurchase program. in 2015 and 2014, we had 0.7 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. at december31, 2015, the amount available under the share repurchase plan, announced on december 14, 2015, totaled $14 billion.capital resources we have substantial borrowing capacity. any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. we have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. throughout 2015 and at december31, 2015, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. currently, we have $5.0 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. we anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs.financing commitments totaled $16.3 billion and $16.7 billion at december 31, 2015 and 2014. we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. however, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. in addition, many of our non-u.s. customers finance aircraft purchases through the export-import bank of the united states. following the expiration of the banks charter on june 30, 2015, the banks charter was reauthorized in december 2015. the bank is now authorized through september 30, 2019. however, until the u.s. senate confirms members sufficient to reconstitute a quorum of the banks board of directors, the bank will not be able to approve any transaction totaling more than $10 million. as a result, we may fund additional commitments and/or enter into new financing arrangements with customers.in the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. we believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. however, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities.at december 31, 2015 and 2014, our pension plans were $17.9 billion and $17.3 billion underfunded as measured under gaap. on an employee retirement income security act (erisa) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at december31, 2015 with minimal required contributions in 2016. we expect to make contributions to our plans of approximately $0.1 billion in 2016. we may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.at december31, 2015, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. the most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). when considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.40table of contentscontractual

reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. pension and other postretirement benefits pension cash requirements are based on an estimate of our minimum funding requirements, pursuant to erisa regulations, although we may make additional discretionary contributions. estimates of other postretirement benefits are based on both our estimated future benefit payments and the estimated contributions to plans that are funded through trusts.purchase obligations purchase obligations represent contractual agreements to purchase goods or services that are legally binding; specify a fixed, minimum or range of quantities; specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position. purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position production related purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. the most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. we have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. in addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. these agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. the need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. a significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. these amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. in these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.41table of contentspurchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.industrial participation agreements we have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the u.s. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. these commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. however, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-u.s. customers. we do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. in certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. during 2015, we incurred no such penalties. as of december31, 2015, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $18.4 billion that extend through 2030. purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. to be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.commercial

commitments. however, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required. see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.contingent obligationswe have significant contingent obligations that arise in the ordinary course of business, which include the following:legal various legal proceedings, claims and investigations are pending against us. legal contingencies are discussed in note 20 to our consolidated financial statements.environmental remediation we are involved with various environmental remediation activities and have recorded a liability of $566 million at december31, 2015. for additional information, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.income taxes we have $1,617 million of unrecognized tax benefits at december31, 2015 for uncertain tax positions. for further discussion of income taxes, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.42table of contentsoff-balance sheet arrangementswe are a party to certain off-balance sheet arrangements including certain guarantees. for discussion of these arrangements, see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.non-gaap measurescore operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per shareour consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america (gaap) which we supplement with certain non-gaap financial information. these non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. we encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the impact of certain pension and other postretirement benefit expenses that are not allocated to business segments - see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements.management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance. management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to u.s. government contracts.reconciliation of gaap measures to non-gaap measuresthe table below

accounting is used to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit predominantly by our bds business. contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. for each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). the majority of these contracts are with the u.s. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contracts inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. for the year ended december 31, 2015, net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased earnings from operations by $224 million. for the years ended december 31, 2014 and 2013 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased earnings from operations by $100 million and $242 million.due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. if the combined gross margin for all contracts in bds for all of 2015 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $304 million. in addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.program accountingprogram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. a program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. for each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.44table of contentsfactors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. the sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary or deflationary trends.to ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.the program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower initial margins than established programs. in addition, actual costs incurred for earlier units in excess of the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity are included within program inventory as deferred production costs. deferred production, unamortized tooling and other non-recurring costs are expected to be fully recovered when all units in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost as learning curve and other improvements are realized.due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is reasonably possible that changes in underlying circumstances or assumptions could have a material effect on program gross margins. if the combined gross margin percentages for our commercial airplane programs had been estimated to be 1% higher or lower it would have a similar effect on the commercial airplane segments operating margins. for the year-ended december 31, 2015, a 1% increase or decrease in operating margins for our commercial airplane segment would have a $650 million impact on operating earnings.   the 747 is in a reach-forward loss position at december 31, 2015 while the 787 program had near breakeven margins during 2015. absent changes in estimated revenues or costs, subsequent 747 deliveries are recorded at zero margin. reductions to the estimated loss in subsequent periods are spread over all undelivered units in the accounting quantity, whereas increases to the estimated loss are recorded immediately as an additional reach-forward loss. if we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if we are required to change one or more of our pricing, cost or other assumptions related to these programs, we could be required to record additional reach-forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results.goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairmentswe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. if we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the 45table of contentstwo-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. for operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. if the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. in this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.the cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.we completed our assessment of goodwill as of april1, 2015 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. as of december 31, 2015, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had $490 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the jeppesen and aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. we test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. a 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would not impact the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets.pension plansthe majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans will transition to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. these measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and shareholders equity.the following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of december31, 2015.(dollars in millions)changeindiscountrateincrease25bpschangeindiscountratedecrease25bpspension plansprojected benefit obligation($2,128)$2,648net periodic pension cost(129)152pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. a decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2015 net periodic pension expense by $148 million. we expect 2016 net periodic pension cost 46table of contentsto decrease by approximately $2,119 million and the portion recognized in earnings to decrease by approximately $378 million primarily due to lower service cost and amortization of actuarial losses.othersection 219 of the iran threat reduction and syria human rights act of 2012 and section 13(r) of the securities exchange act of 1934, as amended (the act), require disclosure of certain activities, transactions or dealings relating to iran that occurred during the period covered by this report. disclosure is required even if the activities, transactions or dealings were conducted in compliance with applicable law. we have disclosed such activities in our quarterly report on form 10-q for the second quarter of 2015 and such disclosure is incorporated herein by reference. during the fourth quarter of 2015, we agreed to sell aircraft maintenance manuals to iran air tours. we generated no revenues or net profits during the fourth quarter of 2015 from these activities. these sales were authorized by a license from the u.s. office of foreign assets control (ofac). boeing applied for the ofac license consistent with guidance from the u.s. government in connection with ongoing negotiations between the p5+1 nations and iran related to, among other things, the safety of irans civil aviation industry. we may engage in additional activities pursuant to this license, which sales may require additional disclosure pursuant to section 13(r) of the act.item7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate riskwe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. additionally, bcc uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. as of december31, 2015, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. the investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.foreign currency exchange rate riskwe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. we use foreign currency forward contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. foreign currency forward contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. at december31, 2015, a 10% increase or decrease in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have increased or decreased our unrealized losses by $229 million. consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. when taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.47table of contentsitem8. financial statements and

results.54table of contentsthe boeing company and subsidiariesnotes to the consolidated financial statementsyears ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 (dollars in millions, except per share data)note 1  summary of significant accounting policiesprinciples of consolidation and basis of presentationthe consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared by management of the boeing company (herein referred to as boeing, the company, we, us, or our). these statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. certain amounts have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation.during 2015 we adopted fasb accounting standards update no. 2015-17, balance sheet classification of deferred income taxes, which requires that the consolidated statements of financial position reflect all deferred income tax assets and liabilities as non-current. the company elected to retrospectively apply the provisions of this standard and prior year balances have been revised to reflect the current year presentation.standards issued and not yet implementedin may 2014, the financial accounting standards board (fasb) issued accounting standards update no. 2014-09, revenue from contracts with customers. the new standard was originally effective for reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2016 and early adoption was not permitted. on august 12, 2015, the fasb approved a one year delay of the effective date to reporting periods beginning after december 15, 2017, while permitting companies to voluntarily adopt the new standard as of the original effective date. the comprehensive new standard will supersede existing revenue recognition guidance and require revenue to be recognized when promised goods or services are transferred to customers in amounts that reflect the consideration to which the company expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. adoption of the new rules could affect the timing of revenue recognition for certain transactions. the guidance permits two implementation approaches, one requiring retrospective application of the new standard with restatement of prior years and one requiring prospective application of the new standard with disclosure of results under old standards. the company is currently evaluating when to adopt the new standard, the impacts of adoption and the implementation approach to be used. use of estimatesmanagement makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. those assumptions and estimates directly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. significant estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financial statements are disclosed in these notes to the consolidated financial statements.operating cyclefor classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year.55table of contentsrevenue and related cost recognitioncontract accounting contract accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by defense, space& security (bds). the majority of business conducted by bds is performed under contracts with the u.s. government and other customers that extend over several years. contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales and costs for each contract resulting in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. for each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. when the current estimates of total sales and costs for a contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized.changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contracts percent complete. in 2015, net unfavorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts decreased earnings from operations by $224 and diluted eps by $0.23. in 2014 and 2013 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all contracts increased earnings from operations by $100 and $242 and diluted eps by $0.10 and $0.23. significant adjustments during the three years ended december 31, 2015 included reach-forward losses of $835 and $425 on the usaf kc-46a tanker contract recorded during 2015 and 2014.we combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective. these essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a single customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, and are performed concurrently or sequentially. when a group of contracts is combined, revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined contracts. similarly, we may segment a single contract or group of contracts when a clear economic decision has been made during contract negotiations that would produce different rates of profitability for each element or phase of the contract.sales related to fixed-price contracts are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. the federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are achieved. incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and are probable are recorded over the performance period of the contract. incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded.program accounting our commercial airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales related to its programs. program accounting is applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. under program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. a program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. to establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a)the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b)the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c)the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program.56table of contentswe recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effects on program margins are recognized prospectively except in cases where the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss in which case the loss is recognized in the current period. see note 11.concession sharing arrangements we account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction to revenue when the related products and services are delivered. the sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. we record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendors products or services, as a reduction in cost of products.spare parts revenue we recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost.service revenue service revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of u.s. government service agreements, which are accounted for using contract accounting. service activities primarily include: support agreements associated with military aircraft and helicopter contracts, space travel on commercial crew, ongoing maintenance of international space station, and technical and flight operation services for commercial aircraft. service revenue and associated cost of sales from pay-in-advance subscription fees are deferred and recognized as services are rendered.financial services revenue we record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases, and notes receivable.lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in sales of services on the consolidated statements of operations. for sales-type/finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. this asset is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur.for operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. operating lease assets, included in customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. we periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense.for notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.reinsurance revenue our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, astro ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers compensation. the member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members individual risk. reinsurance revenues were $136, $135 and $160 during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $132, $144 and $147 during 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively. revenues and costs are presented net in cost of sales in the consolidated statements of operations.57table of contentsfleet supportwe provide assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all our commercial airplane models. collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, and technical data and documents. fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support. this activity continues throughout the aircrafts operational life. services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire models fleet. field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. the costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as cost of services.research and developmentresearch and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, and testing, as well as bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy. we have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than as contract revenues. research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $286, $289 and $285 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.we have established cost sharing arrangements with some suppliers for the 787 program. our cost sharing arrangements state that the supplier contributions are for reimbursements of costs we incur for experimentation, basic design, and testing activities during the 787 development. in each arrangement, we retain substantial rights to the 787 part or component covered by the arrangement. the amounts received from these cost sharing arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses since we have no obligation to refund any amounts received per the arrangements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. specifically, under the terms of each agreement, payments received from suppliers for their share of the costs are typically based on milestones and are recognized as earned when we achieve the milestone events and no ongoing obligation on our part exists. in the event we receive a milestone payment prior to the completion of the milestone, the amount is classified in accrued liabilities until earned.share-based compensationwe provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. for awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. for awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. the expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award.58table of contentsincome taxesprovisions for federal, state, and non-u.s. income taxes are calculated on reported earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions.the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense.postretirement plansthe majority of our employees have earned benefits under defined benefit pension plans. nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans will transition to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. we also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings. the net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). a portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production as product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in shareholders equity (net of taxes). if actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future service period of employees. the funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the consolidated statements of financial position.postemployment planswe record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated.59table of contentsenvironmental remediationwe are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. we routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. the amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. we may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable.cash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. we aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to accounts payable. negative balances reclassified to accounts payable were $163 and $241 at december 31, 2015 and 2014.inventoriesinventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. to the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering.commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. deferred production costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because of volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. we expect that these deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from suppliers in the future. as parts are received, supplier advances are amortized to work in process.the determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. when actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. the determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. when estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.60table of contentsused aircraft purchased by the commercial airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value. see aircraft valuation within this note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or net realizable value. we review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. impaired inventories are charged to cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. if an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid. however, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable, it would be written off in the current period.we net advances and progress billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the consolidated statements of financial position. advances and progress billings in excess of related inventory are reported in advances and billings in excess of related costs.precontract costswe may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. if we determine the costs are probable of recovery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. capitalized precontract costs are included in inventories, net of advances and progress billings, in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position. should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off.property, plant and equipmentproperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 4to 20 years. the principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years digits. capitalized internal use software is included in other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. we periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.long-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. if the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.asset retirement obligationswe record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. recorded amounts are not material.61table of contentswe also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. a liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilitys fair value. in addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the consolidated financial statements.goodwill and other acquired intangiblesgoodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. our annual testing date is april1.we test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. for operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. if the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. in this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. we test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment.our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology, from 5 to 14 years; product know-how, from 6 to 30 years; customer base, from 3 to 19 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 27 years; and other, from 3 to 32 years. we evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. if the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.62table of contentsinvestmentstime deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost.available-for-sale securities include commercial paper, u.s. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. available-for-sale securities are recorded at fair value, and unrealized gains and losses are recorded, net of tax, as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income. realized gains and losses on available-for-sale securities are recognized based on the specific identification method. available-for-sale securities are assessed for impairment quarterly. the equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50%.we classify investment income and loss on our consolidated statements of operations based on whether the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from certain cost method investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in income from operating investments, net. non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes. earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in other income/(expense), net.derivativesall derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them. we use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. for derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. the effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. for our cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately. we have agreements to purchase and sell aluminum to address long-term strategic sourcing objectives and international business requirements. these agreements are derivatives for accounting purposes but are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. we also hold certain derivative instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. for these aluminum agreements and for other derivative instruments not designated for hedge accounting treatment, the changes in their fair value are recorded in earnings immediately.aircraft valuationused aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments in conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (sale aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of sale aircraft. additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the sale aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the sale aircraft. our repurchase of the sale aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. if we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the sale 63table of contentsaircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.exposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:(1)adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recognized upon delivery of the sale aircraft, and/or(2)charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for sale aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in accrued liabilities.the fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. this process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. there are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. these markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customers requirements; or the scrap market. trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. on a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market or using current published third-party aircraft valuations based on the type and age of the aircraft, adjusted for individual attributes and known conditions.used aircraft acquired by the commercial airplanes segment are included in inventories at the lower of cost or net realizable value as it is our intent to sell these assets. to mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. while on operating lease, the assets are included in customer financing.customer financing customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary.we assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets carrying values. differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables.we use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications.impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease we evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. we use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic 64table of contentslife of the asset. we record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.when we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.allowance for losses on customer financing receivables we record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. the allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a)receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b)all other receivables.we determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. factors considered in assessing collectability include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. we determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize.we review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. a receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. the applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for each customer in the portfolio. those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers.we have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall.each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables.warrantiesin conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. the majority of our warranties are issued by our commercial airplanes segment. generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a three to four-year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our authorization. these warranties are included in the programs estimate at completion. on occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. warranties issued by our bds segments principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates. these sales are generally accompanied by a six month to two-year warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the 65table of contentsperiod in which the related product sales occur. the warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average of historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate.we provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. we account for these performance guarantees as warranties. the estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft. we have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in inventories and recorded as a reduction in cost of products at delivery of the related aircraft. these performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in the programs estimate at completion.supplier penaltieswe record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts.guaranteeswe record a liability in accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after december31, 2002. for a residual value guarantee where we received a cash premium, the liability is equal to the cash premium received at the guarantees inception. for credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. we determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditors default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. if at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a)the fair value of the guarantee as described above or (b)the probable contingent loss amount.note 2  goodwill and acquired intangibleschanges in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014 were as

earnings per share basic and diluted earnings per share are computed using the two-class method, which is an earnings allocation method that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. the undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings.basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding.diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.67table of contentsthe elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows:(in millions - except per share amounts)years

december31, 2015, these amounts are primarily associated with u.s. federal tax issues such as the amount of research tax credits claimed, the u.s. manufacturing activity tax benefit, tax basis adjustments and u.s. taxation of foreign earnings. also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed.audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve the matters presently under consideration for the 2011-2012 tax years with the irs. depending on the timing and outcome of that audit settlement, unrecognized tax benefits could decrease by up to $115 based on current estimates.note 5  accounts receivable, netaccounts receivable at december 31 consisted of the following:20152014u.s. government contracts$4,864$4,281commercial

evaluated for impairment1,7901,819total financing receivables$1,876$1,905we determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we had no material receivables that were greater than 30 days past due and we had no impaired customer financing receivables during 2015 and 2014.income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer. for the year ended december 31, 2013, interest income recognized on such receivables was $30, and the average recorded investment in impaired financing receivables was $376. the change in the allowance for losses on financing receivables for the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, consisted of the following:201520142013beginning balance - january 1($21)($49)($60)customer financing valuation benefit52811ending balance - december 31($16)($21)($49)collectively evaluated for impairment($16)($21)($49)the adequacy of the allowance for losses is assessed quarterly. three primary factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are customer credit ratings, default rates and collateral values. we assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies. our financing receivable balances at december31 by internal credit rating category are shown below:rating categories20152014bbb$973$1,055bb536b258633ccc23131other8686total carrying value of financing receivables$1,876$1,905at december31, 2015, our allowance related to receivables with ratings of b, bb and bbb. we applied default rates that averaged 16%, 10% and 2% to the exposure associated with those receivables.74table of contentscustomer financing exposure customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. the value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and overall market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. declines in collateral values are also a significant driver of our allowance for losses. generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft. our customer financing portfolio is primarily collateralized by out-of-production aircraft. the majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the following aircraft models at december31:20152014717 aircraft ($372 and $421 accounted for as operating leases)$1,415$1,562747 aircraft

payment and the $209 partner loan obligations. on september 28, 2015, the district court granted summary judgment in 77table of contentsboeings favor on all claims against the other partners.further proceedings will determine the final damage amount, including potential interest payments.if the partners decide to appeal or seek reconsideration of the district courts ruling additional proceedings would ensue. prior to these proceedings, we had filed a notice of arbitration with the stockholm chamber of commerce seeking reimbursement from the other partners for a portion of these amounts. in 2010, the arbitrator ruled that the stockholm chamber of commerce lacked jurisdiction to hear the matter, which ruling has been on appeal in the swedish appellate courts since mid-2014. during the fourth quarter of 2015, the supreme court of sweden confirmed our right to pursue this appeal in the swedish appellate courts. we believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. in the event we are unable to secure reimbursement of $147 related to our payment under the bank guarantee and $209 related to partner loans made to sea launch, we could incur additional charges. our current assessment as to the collectability of these receivables takes into account the current economic conditions in russia and ukraine, although we will continue to monitor the situation.spirit aerosystemsas of december 31, 2015, other assets included $140 of receivables related to an indemnification from spirit aerosystems, inc. (spirit), for costs incurred related to pension and retiree medical obligations of former boeing employees that were subsequently employed by spirit. during the fourth quarter of 2014, boeing filed a complaint against spirit in delaware superior court seeking to enforce our rights to indemnification and to recover from spirit amounts incurred by boeing for pension and retiree medical obligations. we expect to fully recover from spirit and do not expect to incur any losses.note 11  liabilities, commitments and contingenciesaccrued liabilitiesaccrued liabilities at december31 consisted of the

low end of a range of reasonably possible costs expected to be incurred to remediate sites, including operation and maintenance over periods of up to 30 years. it is reasonably possible that we may incur charges that exceed these recorded amounts because of regulatory agency orders and directives, changes in laws and/or regulations, higher than expected costs and/or the discovery of new or additional contamination. as part of our estimating process, we develop a range of reasonably possible alternate scenarios that includes the high end of a range of reasonably possible cost estimates for all remediation sites for which we have sufficient information based on our experience and existing laws and regulations. there are some potential remediation obligations where the costs of remediation cannot be reasonably estimated. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, the high end of the estimated range of reasonably possible remediation costs exceeded our recorded liabilities by $853 and $874.product warrantiesthe following table summarizes product warranty activity recorded during the years ended december 31, 2015 and 2014.20152014beginning balance  january1$1,504$1,570additions for

definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (sale aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of sale aircraft. the probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. the probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer.trade-in commitment agreements at december31, 2015 have expiration dates from 2016 through 2026. at december 31, 2015 and 2014, total contractual trade-in commitments were $1,585 and $2,392. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $240 and $446 and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $240 and $446. 79table of contentsfinancing commitmentsfinancing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, totaled $16,283 and $16,723 as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. the estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of december31, 2015 are as follows:total2016$2,89720173,66420183,23520192,88420201,321thereafter2,282$16,283as of december31, 2015, $15,919 of these financing commitments related to customers we believe have less than investment-grade credit. we have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided.standby letters of credit and surety bondswe have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $4,968 and $3,985 as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.commitments to ulawe and lockheed martin corporation have each committed to provide ula with additional capital contributions in the event ula does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. as of december31, 2015, ulas total remaining obligation to boeing under the inventory supply agreement was $120.see note 6.c-17production of the c-17 aircraft ended in the fourth quarter of 2015. at december31, 2015, one aircraft remained unsold, while our backlog includes international orders for four c-17 aircraft that are scheduled for delivery in 2016. during 2015 we received orders for six c-17 aircraft and we believe it is probable that we will receive an order for the remaining unsold aircraft from an international customer. should an order not materialize we could incur charges to write down inventory. f/a-18at december 31, 2015, our backlog included 48 f/a-18 aircraft under contract with the u.s. navy.the orders in backlog include an order for 15 aircraft finalized in october 2015. the consolidated appropriations act, 2016, passed in december 2015, funds 12 additional f/a-18 aircraft that, combined with the orders in backlog, would complete production in mid-2018. the presidents fiscal year 2017 budget request submitted in february 2016 includes funding for two additional f/a-18 aircraft. we are continuing to work with our u.s. customers as well as international customers to secure additional orders that would extend the program beyond 2018.80table of contentsshould additional orders not materialize, it is reasonably possible that we will decide to end production of the f/a-18 in 2018. we are still evaluating the full financial impact of a potential production shutdown, including any recovery that may be available from the u.s. government.kc-46a tankerwe have also begun work on low rate initial production aircraft for the u.s. air force (usaf). the usaf is expected to authorize two low rate initial production lots in 2016 for a total of 19 aircraft, subject to satisfactory progress being made on the engineering, manufacturing and development contract. at december 31, 2015, we had approximately $429 of capitalized precontract costs and $1,589 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers associated with the kc-46a tanker.company owned life insurancemcdonnell douglas corporation insured its executives with company owned life insurance (coli), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. although we do not use coli currently, these obligations from the merger with mcdonnell douglas are still a commitment at this time. we have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the cash surrender value was $487 and $466 and the total loans were $456 and $439. as we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31, 2015 and 2014.united states government defense environment overviewthe enactment of the bipartisan budget act of 2015 in november 2015 established overall defense spending levels for fy2016 and fy2017. however, uncertainty remains with respect to levels of defense spending for fy2018 and beyond, including risk of future sequestration cuts. significant uncertainty also continues with respect to program-level appropriations for the u.s. department of defense (u.s. dod) and other government agencies, including the national aeronautics and space administration, within the overall budgetary framework described above. future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the authorization and appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. in addition to the risks described above, if congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which may have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts, sequestration impacts or program-level appropriations. for example, requirements to furlough employees in the u.s. dod or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders. kc-46a tanker and bds fixed-price development contractsfixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. bds fixed-price contracts with significant development work include commercial crew, saudi f-15, usaf kc-46a tanker and commercial and military satellites. the operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. changes to cost and revenue estimates could result in lower margins or material charges for reach-forward losses. for example, during the second quarter of 2015, higher estimated costs to complete the kc-46a tanker contract for the usaf resulted in a reach-forward loss of $835.81table of contentsrecoverable costs on government contracts our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the u.s. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. we work with the u.s. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. if we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the u.s. government.russia/ukrainewe continue to monitor political unrest involving russia and ukraine, where we and some of our suppliers source titanium products and/or have operations. a number of our commercial customers also have operations in russia and ukraine.to date, we have not experienced any significant disruptions to production or deliveries.should suppliers or customers experience disruption, our production and/or deliveries could be materially impacted.747 programduring the fourth quarter of 2015, we recorded a charge of $885 to recognize a reach-forward loss on the 747 program primarily due to slower than expected growth in global cargo markets, resulting in market and pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated driving reductions in our planned production rates. the charge is primarily related to lower anticipated revenues reflecting ongoing pricing and market pressures as well as higher estimated costs due to the reduction in the production rate from 1.0 per month to 0.5 per month in september 2016. we currently plan to return to a rate of 1.0 per month in 2019. we have a number of completed aircraft in inventory as well as unsold production positions and we remain focused on obtaining additional orders and implementing cost-reduction efforts. if we are unable to obtain sufficient orders in 2016 and/or market, production and other risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face an additional reach-forward loss that may be material.787 programduring 2015 the 787 program continued to have near breakeven gross margins. the combination of production challenges, change incorporation on early build aircraft, schedule delays, customer and supplier impacts and changes to price escalation factors has created significant pressure on program profitability. if risks related to this program, including risks associated with planned production rate increases or introducing and manufacturing the 787-10 derivative as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, as well as a reach-forward loss that may be material. 82table of contentsnote 12  arrangements with off-balance sheet riskwe enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of business, primarily in the form of guarantees.the following table provides quantitative data regarding our third party guarantees. the maximum potential payments represent a worst-case scenario, and do not necessarily reflect amounts that we expect to pay. estimated proceeds from collateral and recourse

date. estimated proceeds from collateral/recourse in the table above represent the lower of the contracted repurchase price or the expected fair value of each aircraft at the specified repurchase date.indemnifications to ula in 2006, we agreed to indemnify ula through december31, 2020 against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 of boeing delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus $1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on march31, 2021. since inception, ula has consumed $1,253 of the $1,360 of inventory that was contributed by us and has yet to consume $107. under the inventory supply agreement, we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of $1,367 through december31, 2015. ula has made payments of $1,740 to us under the inventory supply agreement and we have made $71 of indemnification payments to ula. we agreed to indemnify ula against potential losses that ula may incur in the event ula is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the usaf for four satellite missions. we believe ula is entitled to additional contract pricing. in december 2008, ula submitted a claim to the usaf to re-price the contract value for two satellite missions. in march 2009, the usaf issued a denial of that claim. in june 2009, ula filed a notice of appeal, and in october 2009, ula filed a complaint before the armed services board of contract appeals (asbca) for a contract adjustment for the price of the two satellite missions. in september 2009, the usaf exercised its option for a third satellite mission. during the third quarter of 2010, ula submitted a claim to the usaf to re-price the contract value of the third mission. the usaf did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to the expiration of the contract. in march 2011, ula filed a notice of appeal before the asbca, seeking to re-price the third mission. on november 20, 2013, the asbca denied usaf motions for summary judgment against ula in large part, leaving ulas claims against the usaf substantially intact. the hearing before the asbca concluded on december 20, 2013. the parties filed their final post-hearing briefs in may 2014. the asbca may now issue a decision at any time. if ula is ultimately unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for an 83table of contentsindemnification payment up to $261 and may record up to $277 in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions.potential payments for other delta contracts include $85 related to deferred support costs and $91 related to deferred production costs. in june 2011, the defense contract management agency (dcma) notified ula that it had determined that $271 of deferred support costs are not recoverable under government contracts. in december 2011, the dcma notified ula of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114 of deferred production costs. ula and boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in november 2011, ula filed a certified claim with the usaf for collection of deferred support and production costs. the usaf issued a final decision denying ulas certified claim in may 2012. on june 14, 2012, boeing and ula filed a suit in the court of federal claims seeking recovery of the deferred support and production costs from the u.s. government. on november 9, 2012, the u.s. government filed an answer to our claim and asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred support cost invoices. we believe that the u.s. governments counterclaim is without merit, and have filed an answer challenging it on multiple grounds. the litigation is in the discovery phase and the court has not yet set a trial date. if, contrary to our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make indemnification payments to ula for up to $317 of the costs questioned by the dcma.other indemnifications in conjunction with our sales of electron dynamic devices, inc. and rocketdyne propulsion and power businesses and our commercial airplanes facilities in wichita, kansas and tulsa and mcalester, oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. we are unable to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). as a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. to the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in note 11.credit guarantees we have issued credit guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale and/or financing of commercial aircraft. under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original lessee or debtor or certain specified services are not performed. a substantial portion of these guarantees has been extended on behalf of original lessees or debtors with less than investment-grade credit. our commercial aircraft credit guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft and certain other assets. current outstanding credit guarantees expire within the next five years.industrial revenue bondsindustrial revenue bonds (irb) issued by the city of wichita and st. louis county were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our wichita and st. louis sites. tax benefits associated with irbs include a ten-year property tax abatement and a sales tax exemption from the kansas department of revenue, and a twelve-year property tax abatement and sales tax exemption from st. louis county. we record these properties on our consolidated statements of financial position, along with capital lease obligations to repay the proceeds of the irbs. we have also purchased the irbs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the properties purchased with the irb proceeds.the capital lease obligations and irb assets are recorded net in the consolidated statements of financial position. as of december 31, 2015 and 2014, the assets and liabilities associated with the city of wichita and st. louis county irbs were $584 and $638.84table of contentsnote 13  debton february 20, 2015, we issued $750 of fixed rate senior notes consisting of $250 due march 1,

benefit pension plans. nonunion and the majority of union employees that had participated in defined benefit pension plans will transition to a company-funded defined contribution retirement savings plan in 2016. we fund our major pension plans through trusts. pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments.we also have other postretirement benefits (opb) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. certain employee groups, including employees covered by most united auto workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage. the funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (pbo). we have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in other assets, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either accrued retiree health care or accrued pension plan liability, net. the portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the pbo exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in accrued liabilities. the components of net periodic benefit cost were as follows:pensionother postretirement benefitsyears ended december31,201520142013201520142013service

remain level beyond that 30-year point. the present value of each plans benefits is calculated by applying the discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. all bonds are u.s. issues, with a minimum outstanding of $50.the pension funds expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. while consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. the expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (mrva). since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the mrva based on a five-year moving average of plan assets. as of december31, 2015, the mrva was approximately $2,731 greater than the fair market value of assets.89table of contentsassumed health care cost trend rates were as follows:december31,201520142013health care cost trend rate assumed

reconciliation of forecast claims against actual claims, review of trend assumptions of other plan sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. a one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect:increasedecreaseeffect on total of service and interest cost$54($44)effect on postretirement benefit obligation647(551)plan assetsinvestment strategy the overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified.we periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. we use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. we identify investment benchmarks for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible.actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions, and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. short-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. the asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced on a monthly basis.the actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at december31 were as follows:actual allocationstarget

the global strategies asset class was consolidated with the hedge funds asset class.90table of contentsfixed income securities are invested primarily in a diversified portfolio of long duration instruments. global equity securities are invested in a diversified portfolio of u.s. and non-u.s. companies, across various industries and market capitalizations.real estate and real assets include global private investments that may be held through an investment in a limited partnership (lp) or other fund structures and publicly traded investments (such as real estate investment trusts (reits) in the case of real estate). real estate includes, but is not limited to, investments in office, retail, apartment and industrial properties. real assets include, but are not limited to, investments in natural resources (such as energy, farmland and timber), commodities and infrastructure. private equity investment vehicles are primarily limited partnerships (lps) and fund-of-funds that mainly invest in u.s. and non-u.s. leveraged buyout, venture capital and special situation strategies.hedge fund investments seek to capitalize on inefficiencies identified across and within different asset classes or markets. hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to directional, event driven, relative value, long-short and multi-strategy.investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. certain investment managers are authorized to use derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation.as a percentage of total pension plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 13.1% and 3.5% for fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and 4.0% and 2.0% for global equity and commodities at december 31, 2015 and 2014.risk management in managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives. valuation is governed through several types of procedures, including reviews of manager valuation policies, custodian valuation processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing.fair value measurements the following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of december 31, 2015 and 2014. the fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. we have retrospectively adopted asu no. 2015-07, disclosures for investments in certain entities that calculate net asset value per share. the fair value hierarchy now excludes certain investments which are valued using net asset value (navs) as a practical expedient.  91table of contentsdecember31, 2015december31,

securitys relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single present value amount. inputs used in developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads.common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their navs that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingled fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. all of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments. in the event a market price is not available for instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, amortized cost is used as a proxy for fair value. common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. private equity and private debt nav valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. for those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily lps) we use navs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events.real estate and real asset nav valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. for those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily lps) navs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. publicly traded reits and infrastructure stocks are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.hedge funds consist of direct hedge funds and fund-of-fund limited liability company (llc) structures. for direct hedge funds the navs are generally based on valuation of the underlying investments. this is primarily done by applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held. the navs of the fund-of-funds are based on the navs of the underlying hedge funds as well as any cash and accruals held at the fund-of-fund level. redemptions in hedge funds are based on specific terms and conditions of the individual funds.investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the general partner (gp), fund manager or third party administrator. additionally, some investments in fixed income and equity are made via commingled vehicles and are valued in a similar fashion. pension assets invested in commingled and limited partnership structures rely on the nav of these investments as the practical expedient for the valuations.93table of contentsthe following tables present a reconciliation of level 3 assets (excluding investments which are valued using navs as a practical expedient)

plan assets the majority of opb plan assets are invested in a balanced index fund which is comprised of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. the index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (level 1). the expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost.94table of

the level of retirement benefits required by erisa, and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs.we have an agreement with the u.s. government with respect to certain pension plans. under the agreement, should we terminate any of the plans under conditions in which the plans assets exceed that plans obligations, the u.s. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plans assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under u.s. government contracts.defined contribution planswe provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. the principal plans are the company-sponsored 401(k) plans. the expense for these defined contribution plans was $768, $764 and $742 in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.note 15  share-based compensation and other compensation arrangementsshare-based compensationour 2003 incentive stock plan, as amended and restated, permits awards of incentive and non-qualified stock options, stock appreciation rights, restricted stock or units, performance shares, performance restricted stock or units, performance units and other stock and cash-based awards to our employees, officers, directors, consultants, and independent contractors. the aggregate number of shares of our stock authorized for issuance under the plan is 87,000,000.shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. we believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to satisfy these issuances during 2016.95table of contentsshare-based plans expense is primarily included in general and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our executives. the share-based

market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. the stock options vest over a period of three years, with 34% vesting after the first year, 33% vesting after the second year and the remaining 33% vesting after the third year. if an executive terminates employment for any reason, the non-vested portion of the stock option will not vest and all rights to the non-vested portion will terminate. we discontinued granting options in 2014, replacing them with performance-based restricted stock units.stock option activity for the year ended december31,

31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $399, $343 and $1,097 with a related tax benefit of $135, $87 and $190, respectively, derived from the compensation deductions resulting from these option exercises. at december31, 2015, there was $4 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to our stock option plan which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of two months. the grant date fair value of stock options vested during the years ended december 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $56, $87 and $89, respectively.the stock options granted in february 2013 had a fair value of $15.85 which was estimated using the black-scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions: expected life of 6 years, expected volatility of 29.0% based upon our historical stock volatility, risk-free interest rates of 1.0%, and expected dividend yield of 2.6%.the expected volatility of the stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock volatility and the volatility levels implied on the grant date by actively traded option contracts on our common stock. we determined the expected term of the stock option grants to be six years, calculated using the simplified 96table of contentsmethod in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin 110. we use the simplified method since we changed the vesting terms, tax treatment and the recipients of our stock options beginning in 2006 such that we believe our historical data prior to 2006 does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term and we do not have enough option exercise data from our grants issued subsequent to 2006 to support our own estimate as a result of vesting terms and changes in the stock price.restricted stock unitsin february2015, 2014 and 2013, we granted to our executives 590,778, 695,651 and 1,375,414 restricted stock units (rsus) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $154.64, $129.58 and $75.97 per unit, respectively. the rsus granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. if an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. in all other cases, the rsus will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate. in addition to rsus awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant rsus to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements.these rsus are labeled other rsus in the table below. the fair values of all rsus are estimated using the average of the high and low stock prices on the date of grant. rsu activity for the year ended december31, 2015 was as follows:long-term incentive program othernumber of units:outstanding at beginning of

unitsperformance-based restricted stock units (pbrsus) are stock units that pay out based on the companys total shareholder return as compared to a group of peer companies over a three-year period. the award payout can range from 0% to 200% of the initial pbrsu grant, but will not exceed 400% of the initial value (excluding dividend equivalent credits). the pbrsus granted under this program will vest at the payout amount and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. if an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) remains eligible under the award and, if the award is earned, will receive a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. in all other cases, the pbrsus will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate.97table of contentsin february2015 and 2014, we granted to our executives 556,203 and 662,215 pbrsus as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $164.26 and $136.12 per unit. compensation expense for the award is recognized over the three-year performance period based upon the grant date fair value estimated using a monte-carlo simulation model. the model used the following assumptions in 2015 and 2014: expected volatility of 20.35% and 24.2% based upon our historical stock volatility, risk-free interest rates of 1.03% and 0.72%, and no expected dividend yield because the units earn dividend equivalents.pbrsu activity for the year

based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars. the amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending on the companys performance against plan for a three-year period. the compensation committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period.during 2015, 2014 and 2013, we granted performance awards to our executives with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three-year period following the grant date. the minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2015, 2014 and 2013 performance awards is $349, $327 and $255, respectively. the 2013 grant is expected to be paid out in cash in march 2016.deferred compensationthe company has a deferred compensation plan which permits executives to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and certain other incentive awards. participants can diversify deferred compensation among 23 investment funds including a boeing stock unit account.total expense related to deferred compensation was $63, $44 and $238

refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs and level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs. the following table presents our assets and liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis and are categorized using the fair value hierarchy. december31, 2015december31, 2014totallevel1level2totallevel1level2assetsmoney market funds$4,504$4,504$3,826$3,826available-for-sale investments:commercial paper8787corporate

prices or broker/dealer quotes of identical or comparable instruments. derivatives include foreign currency, commodity and interest rate contracts. our foreign currency forward contracts are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. the fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve.certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). the following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended december31 due to long-lived asset impairment, and the fair value and asset classification of the related assets as of the impairment date:20152014fair valuetotal lossesfair valuetotal lossesoperating lease equipment$270($159)$187($170)property, plant and equipment8(6)19(15)other assets and acquired intangible assets(17)total$278($165)$206($202)the fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. the values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market trends. under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft. property, plant and equipment, other assets and acquired intangible assets were primarily valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. for level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis during the year ended december 31, 2015, the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date,

rates for loans of the same risk and maturities. the fair values of our variable rate notes receivable that reprice frequently approximate their carrying amounts. the fair values of fixed rate notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. the fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as level 2 and is based on current market yields. for our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing cost derived from dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. the fair values of our debt classified as level 3 are based on discounted cash flow models using the implied yield from similar securities. with regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, accounts payable and long-term payables. the carrying values of those items, as reflected in the consolidated statements of financial position, approximate their fair value at december 31, 2015 and 2014. the fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (level 1).note 20  legal proceedingsvarious legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts, employment and other matters are pending against us. potentially material contingencies are discussed below. we are subject to various u.s. government inquiries and investigations, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted in the past. such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or 104table of contentssubdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. we believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we will disclose either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.employment, labor and benefits litigationin the second quarter of 2014, boeing agreed to a $90 settlement with plaintiffs in the harkness case with respect to litigation initiated by former boeing employees in 2007 upon the sale of the wichita facility to spirit aerosystems, inc. (spirit) in 2005. the settlement was approved by the district court in a fairness hearing in september 2015. the payment was made in the fourth quarter and the indemnification receivable from spirit is included in other assets at december 31, 2015. on october13, 2006, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the u.s. district court for the southern district of illinois. plaintiffs, seeking to represent a class of similarly situated participants and beneficiaries in the boeing company voluntary investment plan (the vip), alleged that fees and expenses incurred by the vip were and are unreasonable and excessive, not incurred solely for the benefit of the vip and its participants, and were undisclosed to participants. the plaintiffs further alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in violation of 502(a)(2) of erisa, and sought injunctive and equitable relief pursuant to 502(a)(3) of erisa. the parties reached a provisional settlement on august 26, 2015, subject to a fairness hearing currently scheduled for march 2016. we do not expect this matter or the associated settlement to have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations or cash flows.note 21  segment informationwe operate in five principal segments: commercial airplanes; boeing military aircraft (bma), network& space systems (n&ss), and global services& support (gs&s),

statements are the responsibility of the companys management. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the financial statements based on our audits.we conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial

assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our audits provide a

assessment of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included in the accompanying managements report on internal control over financial reporting. our responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2015, based on the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework (2013) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the consolidated financial statements
