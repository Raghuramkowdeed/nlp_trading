INCLUDING BOTH COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY, ADVANCE SPACE AND OTHER COMPANY-SPONSORED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THESE EXPENDITURES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED INCLUDING AMOUNTS ALLOCABLE AS REIMBURSABLE OVERHEAD COSTS ON U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

OUR TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AMOUNTED TO $3.3 BILLION, $2.2 BILLION,

AND $1.9 BILLION IN 2006, 2005, AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THIS IS NET OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COST SHARING PAYMENTS FROM SUPPLIERS OF $160 MILLION IN 2006, $611 MILLION IN 2005 AND $205 MILLION IN 2004. THESE COST SHARING PAYMENTS ARE RELATED TO

OUR 787 PROGRAM.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS FOR EACH OF THE

MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ON PAGES 21 - 34.

EMPLOYEES

OUR WORKFORCE LEVEL AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 WAS APPROXIMATELY 154,000, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 1,300 IN CANADA AND 3,700 IN AUSTRALIA.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, OUR PRINCIPAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WERE WITH THE FOLLOWING UNIONS.

COMPETITION

THE COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT MARKET AND THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REMAIN EXTREMELY

COMPETITIVE. WE FACE AGGRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS, INCLUDING AIRBUS, THAT ARE INTENT ON INCREASING THEIR MARKET SHARE. TO EFFECTIVELY AND PROFITABLY COMPETE, WE FOCUS ON NEW PRODUCT TECHNOLOGY, IMPROVING OUR PROCESSES AND CONTINUING COST

REDUCTION EFFORTS. WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE OUR EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES NETWORK FOR AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO PROVIDE A HIGHER LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND PRODUCTIVITY.

IDS FACES STRONG COMPETITION IN ALL MARKET SEGMENTS, PRIMARILY FROM LOCKHEED MARTIN,

NORTHROP GRUMMAN, RAYTHEON AND GENERAL DYNAMICS. NON-U.S. COMPANIES SUCH AS BAE SYSTEMS AND EUROPEAN AERONAUTIC DEFENCE AND SPACE COMPANY CONTINUE TO BUILD A STRATEGIC PRESENCE IN THE U.S. MARKET BY STRENGTHENING THEIR NORTH AMERICAN OPERATIONS AND

PARTNERING WITH U.S. DEFENSE COMPANIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATORY MATTERS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED IN MOST OF OUR MARKETS. WE DEAL WITH NUMEROUS U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND ENTITIES,

INCLUDING ALL OF THE BRANCHES OF THE U.S. MILITARY, NASA, AND HOMELAND SECURITY. SIMILAR GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES EXIST IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS, MAY TERMINATE ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AT THEIR CONVENIENCE AS WELL AS FOR DEFAULT BASED ON OUR FAILURE TO MEET

SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS. IF ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WERE TO BE TERMINATED FOR CONVENIENCE, WE GENERALLY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PAYMENT FOR WORK COMPLETED AND ALLOWABLE TERMINATION OR CANCELLATION COSTS. IF ANY OF OUR

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WERE TO BE TERMINATED FOR DEFAULT, GENERALLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD PAY ONLY FOR THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AND CAN REQUIRE US TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT PRICE AND THE COST TO RE-PROCURE THE

CONTRACT ITEMS, NET OF THE WORK ACCEPTED FROM THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN ALSO HOLD US LIABLE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE DEFAULT.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.

IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS GOVERNING

PRODUCTION AND QUALITY SYSTEMS, AIRWORTHINESS, AND INSTALLATION APPROVALS, REPAIR PROCEDURES AND CONTINUING OPERATIONAL SAFETY. INTERNATIONALLY, SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS EXIST FOR AIRWORTHINESS, INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONAL APPROVALS. THESE REQUIREMENTS

ARE GENERALLY ADMINISTERED BY THE NATIONAL AVIATION AUTHORITIES OF EACH COUNTRY AND, IN THE CASE OF EUROPE, COORDINATED BY THE EUROPEAN JOINT AVIATION AUTHORITIES.

ENVIRONMENTAL.

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO AND AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS

AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE DISCHARGE, TREATMENT, STORAGE, DISPOSAL, INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION OF CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUBSTANCES AND WASTES. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OUR COMPLIANCE STATUS AND MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND BELIEVE THAT

OUR OPERATIONS ARE IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF CONTAMINATED SITES ARE A NORMAL, RECURRING PART OF OUR OPERATIONS. THESE COSTS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT RELATIVE TO

TOTAL OPERATING COSTS OR CASH FLOWS, AND OFTEN ARE ALLOWABLE COSTS UNDER OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THESE COSTS HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL IN THE PAST. BASED ON INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US AND CURRENT U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICIES

RELATING TO ALLOWABLE COSTS, WE DO NOT EXPECT CONTINUED COMPLIANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR CASH FLOWS.

A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY (PRP) HAS JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY UNDER EXISTING U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WHERE WE HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED A PRP BY THE

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY OR A STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY, WE ARE POTENTIALLY LIABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT OR THIRD PARTIES FOR THE FULL COST OF REMEDIATING CONTAMINATION AT OUR FACILITIES OR FORMER FACILITIES OR AT THIRD-PARTY SITES. IF WE WERE

REQUIRED TO FULLY FUND THE REMEDIATION OF A SITE, THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK WOULD ALLOW US TO PURSUE RIGHTS TO CONTRIBUTION FROM OTHER PRPS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES, SEE NOTE 23 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

INTERNATIONAL.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AND PROCUREMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES, INCLUDING REGULATIONS RELATING TO IMPORT-EXPORT CONTROL, INVESTMENT, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND

REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. INTERNATIONAL SALES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO VARYING CURRENCY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS.

RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS

WE ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ESSENTIAL MATERIALS, PARTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS. THE MOST IMPORTANT RAW MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR OUR AEROSPACE PRODUCTS

4

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARE ALUMINUM (SHEET, PLATE, FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS), TITANIUM (SHEET, PLATE, FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS) AND COMPOSITES (INCLUDING CARBON AND BORON). ALTHOUGH

ALTERNATIVE SOURCES GENERALLY EXIST FOR THESE RAW MATERIALS, QUALIFICATION OF THE SOURCES COULD TAKE A YEAR OR MORE. MANY MAJOR COMPONENTS AND PRODUCT EQUIPMENT ITEMS ARE PROCURED OR SUBCONTRACTED ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS WITH A NUMBER OF DOMESTIC AND

NON-U.S. COMPANIES. WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY OF LARGE NUMBERS OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO MEET PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS, QUALITY STANDARDS AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES AT ANTICIPATED COSTS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN AN EXTENSIVE QUALIFICATION

AND PERFORMANCE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO CONTROL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES, FAILURE OF SUPPLIERS OR SUBCONTRACTORS TO MEET COMMITMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AND CONTRACT PROFITABILITY, WHILE JEOPARDIZING

OUR ABILITY TO FULFILL COMMITMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ARE ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY SOURCES, SUCH AS ELECTRICITY, AT AFFORDABLE PRICES.

OTHER INFORMATION

BOEING WAS ORIGINALLY INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON IN 1916 AND REINCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN 1934. OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE LOCATED AT 100 N. RIVERSIDE, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 60606 AND OUR TELEPHONE NUMBER IS

COMMISSION (SEC). OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, AS WELL AS ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS, ARE AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE THROUGH OUR WEB SITE AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER

STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING SEC REGISTRANTS, INCLUDING BOEING.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

AN INVESTMENT

IN OUR COMMON STOCK OR DEBT SECURITIES INVOLVES RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND OUR ACTUAL RESULTS AND FUTURE TRENDS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR PAST PERFORMANCE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE FOLLOWING.

WE DEPEND HEAVILY UPON COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS, OUR SUPPLIERS AND THE WORLDWIDE MARKET, WHICH ARE

SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS.

WE DERIVE A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINES, SOME OF WHICH HAVE ENCOUNTERED FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES.

WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THE MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINES. WE CAN MAKE NO

ASSURANCE THAT ANY CUSTOMER WILL PURCHASE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM US AFTER OUR CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER ENDS. FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCY, OF ANY OF THE MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR

REVENUES AND OUR OPPORTUNITY TO GENERATE A PROFIT. SEVERAL COMMERCIAL AIRLINES HAVE FILED FOR OR RECENTLY EMERGED FROM BANKRUPTCY.

WE DEPEND ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS TO DELIVER AIRCRAFT ON TIME, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS.

OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER JET AIRCRAFT ON

SCHEDULE IS DEPENDENT UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXECUTION OF INTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS, AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS (SUCH AS ALUMINUM, TITANIUM, AND COMPOSITES), INTERNAL AND SUPPLIER PRODUCED PARTS, CONVERSION OF RAW MATERIALS INTO

PARTS AND ASSEMBLIES, PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AND REGULATORY CERTIFICATION. THE FAILURE OF ANY OR ALL OF THESE FACTORS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT OUT-OF-SEQUENCE WORK AND DISRUPTED PROCESS FLOWS THAT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

INEFFICIENCIES. IN ADDITION, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND MAJOR DERIVATIVES INVOLVES INCREASED RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND CERTIFICATION SCHEDULES.

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE RELY ON MARKET CONDITIONS TO SELL AIRCRAFT INTO THE FUTURE.

THE WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT IS PREDOMINATELY DRIVEN BY LONG-TERM TRENDS IN AIRLINE PASSENGER TRAFFIC. THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS UNDERLYING LONG-TERM TRAFFIC GROWTH ARE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICAL STABILITY, BOTH IN DEVELOPED AND EMERGING

COUNTRIES. DEMAND FOR OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS FURTHER INFLUENCED BY AIRLINE INDUSTRY PROFITABILITY, WORLD TRADE POLICIES, GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, TERRORISM, DISEASE OUTBREAKS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED UPON AIRCRAFT

OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, AND PRICE AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS MAY REQUEST TO CANCEL, MODIFY OR RESCHEDULE ORDERS. WE GENERALLY MAKE SALES

UNDER PURCHASE ORDERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION, MODIFICATION OR RESCHEDULING, CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY COULD RESULT IN CUSTOMER REQUESTS FOR RESCHEDULING OR CANCELLATION OF CONTRACTUAL ORDERS. IF WE AGREE TO SUCH CANCELLATIONS, MODIFICATION OR RESCHEDULING, IT COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE

OUR REVENUES.

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION

RATES COULD CHANGE.

AS A RESULT OF WORLDWIDE DEMAND FOR NEW AIRCRAFT, WE HAVE RECEIVED MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND NET ORDERS PER YEAR DURING 2006 AND 2005. THERE WILL BE PRODUCTION RATE CHANGES IN ORDER TO MEET THE DELIVERY SCHEDULES FOR EXISTING

AND NEW AIRPLANE PROGRAMS. THIS MAY LEAD TO ADDING EXTRA PRODUCTION LINES, IMPLEMENTING INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES, SEEKING ADDITIONAL QUALIFIED AND SKILLED EMPLOYEES, AND OBTAINING OTHER RESOURCES. FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ANY PRODUCTION RATE

CHANGES COULD LEAD TO MISSED DELIVERY COMMITMENTS, AND DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF DELAY IN MEETING DELIVERY COMMITMENTS, ADDITIONAL COSTS AND CUSTOMERS RESCHEDULING THEIR DELIVERIES OR TERMINATING THEIR AIRCRAFT ON CONTRACT WITH US.

WE DEPEND HEAVILY ON U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS.

IN 2006, 46% OF OUR REVENUES WERE DERIVED FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION TO NORMAL BUSINESS RISKS, OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

THE FUNDING OF U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IS SUBJECT TO CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS

. MANY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IN WHICH WE

PARTICIPATE MAY EXTEND FOR SEVERAL YEARS; HOWEVER, THESE PROGRAMS ARE NORMALLY FUNDED ANNUALLY. LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND RELATED ORDERS ARE SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION IF APPROPRIATIONS FOR SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE PERIODS ARE NOT MADE. THE

TERMINATION OF FUNDING FOR A U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAM WOULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE REVENUES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT PROGRAM, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY NEGATIVE IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY MODIFY, CURTAIL OR TERMINATE OUR

CONTRACTS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY MODIFY, CURTAIL OR TERMINATE ITS CONTRACTS AND SUBCONTRACTS WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE AT ITS CONVENIENCE UPON PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COMMITMENTS MADE AT THE TIME OF TERMINATION. MODIFICATION, CURTAILMENT OR

TERMINATION OF OUR MAJOR PROGRAMS OR CONTRACTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR CONTRACT COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

. U.S. GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES MAY AUDIT THE COSTS WE INCUR ON OUR

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, INCLUDING ALLOCATED INDIRECT COSTS. SUCH AUDITS COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR CONTRACT COSTS. ANY COSTS FOUND TO BE IMPROPERLY ALLOCATED TO A SPECIFIC CONTRACT WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED, AND SUCH COSTS ALREADY REIMBURSED

MUST BE REFUNDED. WE HAVE RECORDED CONTRACT REVENUES BASED UPON COSTS WE EXPECT TO REALIZE UPON FINAL AUDIT. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT KNOW THE OUTCOME OF ANY FUTURE AUDITS AND ADJUSTMENTS AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR PROFITS UPON

COMPLETION AND FINAL NEGOTIATION OF AUDITS. IF ANY AUDIT UNCOVERS IMPROPER OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS, INCLUDING TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS, FORFEITURE OF PROFITS, SUSPENSION

OF PAYMENTS, FINES AND SUSPENSION OR PROHIBITION FROM DOING BUSINESS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS.

WE ARE SOMETIMES SUBJECT TO CERTAIN U.S. GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DUE TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. ANY SUCH INQUIRY OR INVESTIGATION COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT

BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS.

THESE REQUIREMENTS, ALTHOUGH CUSTOMARY IN U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, INCREASE OUR PERFORMANCE AND COMPLIANCE COSTS. THESE COSTS MIGHT INCREASE IN THE FUTURE,

REDUCING OUR MARGINS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS COULD LEAD TO SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT, FOR CAUSE, FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING OR SUBCONTRACTING FOR A

PERIOD OF TIME AND COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO SECURE FUTURE U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

WE ENTER INTO FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO LOSSES IF WE HAVE COST OVERRUNS.

MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS IN IDS AND COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES ARE CONTRACTED ON A FIXED-PRICE BASIS. APPROXIMATELY 50% OF IDS REVENUES ARE

GENERATED FROM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS, AND COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT ARE NORMALLY SOLD ON A FIRM FIXED-PRICE BASIS WITH AN INDEXED PRICE ESCALATION CLAUSE. WHILE FIRM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS ALLOW US TO BENEFIT FROM COST SAVINGS, THEY ALSO EXPOSE US TO

THE RISK OF COST OVERRUNS. IF THE INITIAL ESTIMATES WE USE TO CALCULATE THE CONTRACT PRICE AND THE COST TO PERFORM THE WORK PROVE TO BE INCORRECT, WE COULD INCUR LOSSES. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR CONTRACTS HAVE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS RELATING TO COST,

SCHEDULE, AND PERFORMANCE. IF WE FAIL TO MEET THE TERMS SPECIFIED IN THOSE CONTRACTS, THEN OUR COST TO PERFORM THE WORK COULD INCREASE OR OUR PRICE COULD BE REDUCED, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE RISK FOR

REACH-FORWARD LOSSES IF OUR ESTIMATED COSTS EXCEED OUR ESTIMATED PRICE.

FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT WORK INHERENTLY HAS MORE UNCERTAINTY THAN PRODUCTION CONTRACTS AND, THEREFORE, MORE VARIABILITY IN ESTIMATES OF THE COST TO COMPLETE THE WORK. MANY OF THESE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS HAVE VERY COMPLEX DESIGNS. AS

TECHNICAL OR QUALITY ISSUES ARISE, WE MAY EXPERIENCE SCHEDULE DELAYS AND COST IMPACTS, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR ESTIMATED COST TO PERFORM THE WORK OR REDUCE OUR ESTIMATED PRICE, EITHER OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHARGE. SOME FIXED-PRICE

DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS INCLUDE INITIAL PRODUCTION UNITS IN THEIR SCOPE OF WORK. SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE OF THESE CONTRACTS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS AND DELIVERY RATES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM AND DELIVER TO CONTRACT

REQUIREMENTS, OUR CONTRACT PRICE COULD BE REDUCED THROUGH THE INCORPORATION OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT FOR DEFAULT, OR OTHER FINANCIALLY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE. MANAGEMENT USES ITS BEST JUDGMENT TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO PERFORM

THE WORK AND THE PRICE WE WILL EVENTUALLY BE PAID ON FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THE COST AND PRICE ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE, FUTURE EVENTS COULD RESULT IN EITHER UPWARD OR DOWNWARD

ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE ESTIMATES. IN 2006 WE RECORDED CHARGES OF $770 MILLION ON OUR AEW&C PROGRAM, DELAYED DELIVERY OF THE FIRST TWO AIRCRAFT AND REVISED THE DELIVERY SCHEDULE FOR THE REMAINING AIRCRAFT UNDER THIS PROGRAM. WE MAY CONTINUE TO

EXPERIENCE TECHNICAL QUALITY ISSUES REQUIRING FURTHER DELAYS IN SCHEDULE OR REVISIONS TO OUR COST ESTIMATES. EXAMPLES OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS INCLUDE 767 TANKERS, COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY SATELLITES, VIGILARE AND HIGH

FREQUENCY MODERNISATION.

WE ENTER INTO COST-TYPE CONTRACTS WHICH ALSO CARRY RISKS.

APPROXIMATELY 50% OF IDS REVENUES ARE GENERATED FROM COST-TYPE

CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENTS. SOME OF THESE ARE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE COMPLEX DESIGN AND TECHNICAL CHALLENGES. THESE COST-TYPE PROGRAMS TYPICALLY HAVE AWARD OR INCENTIVE FEES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY AND MAY BE EARNED OVER EXTENDED

PERIODS. IN THESE CASES THE ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL RISKS ARE PRIMARILY IN LOWER PROFIT RATES OR PROGRAM CANCELLATION IF COST, SCHEDULE, OR TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUES ARISE. PROGRAMS WHOSE CONTRACTS ARE PRIMARILY COST-TYPE INCLUDE GMD, FCS,

P-8A POSEIDON, PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS, AIRBORNE LASER, JTRS, FAB-T, AND THE E/A-18 GROWLER.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ENTER INTO CONTRACTS THAT INCLUDE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THAT SUBJECT US TO RISKS.

CONTRACTS IN THE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE INDUSTRY INCLUDE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS,

AND GOVERNMENT SATELLITE CONTRACTS ALSO MAY INCLUDE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVES. THESE IN-ORBIT PAYMENTS MAY BE PAID OVER TIME AFTER FINAL SATELLITE ACCEPTANCE OR PAID IN FULL PRIOR TO FINAL SATELLITE ACCEPTANCE. IN BOTH CASES, THE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE

IS AT RISK IF THE SATELLITE DOES NOT PERFORM TO SPECIFICATIONS FOR UP TO 15 YEARS AFTER ACCEPTANCE. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE FEES WE ULTIMATELY EXPECT TO REALIZE IS RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE IN THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD.

IF THE SATELLITE FAILS TO MEET CONTRACTUAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, CUSTOMERS WILL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO CONTINUE MAKING IN-ORBIT PAYMENTS AND/OR WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE REFUNDS TO THE CUSTOMER AND INCUR SIGNIFICANT CHARGES.

WE USE ESTIMATES IN ACCOUNTING FOR MANY CONTRACTS AND PROGRAMS. CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

CONTRACT AND

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRE JUDGMENT RELATIVE TO ASSESSING RISKS, ESTIMATING CONTRACT REVENUES AND COSTS AND MAKING ASSUMPTIONS FOR SCHEDULE AND TECHNICAL ISSUES. DUE TO THE SIZE AND NATURE OF MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS AND PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATION OF

TOTAL REVENUES AND COST AT COMPLETION IS COMPLICATED AND SUBJECT TO MANY VARIABLES. ASSUMPTIONS HAVE TO BE MADE REGARDING THE LENGTH OF TIME TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACT OR PROGRAM BECAUSE COSTS ALSO INCLUDE EXPECTED INCREASES IN WAGES, MATERIALS PRICES

AND ALLOCATED FIXED COSTS. INCENTIVES OR PENALTIES RELATED TO PERFORMANCE ON CONTRACTS ARE CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING SALES AND PROFIT RATES, AND ARE RECORDED WHEN THERE IS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR US TO ASSESS ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE. ESTIMATES OF

AWARD FEES ARE ALSO USED IN SALES AND PROFIT RATES BASED ON ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED AWARDS.

UNDER PROGRAM ACCOUNTING, INVENTORIABLE PRODUCTION COSTS (INCLUDING OVERHEAD), PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED AND CHARGED AS COST OF SALES BY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF BY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR

CONTRACTS. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP OF

SALES TO COST OF SALES, PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF (A) THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN A PROGRAM, (B) THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE UNITS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED, AND (C) THE UNITS

EXPECTED SALES PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING, AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM. SEVERAL FACTORS DETERMINE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, INCLUDING FIRM ORDERS, LETTERS OF INTENT FROM PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS, AND MARKET STUDIES.

CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, CIRCUMSTANCES OR ESTIMATES CONCERNING THE SELECTION OF THE INITIAL ACCOUNTING QUANTITY OR CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, ALONG WITH A FAILURE TO REALIZE PREDICTED COSTS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATION

PROCESSES DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS LIKELY THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT SALES AND PROFIT AMOUNTS COULD BE RECORDED IF WE USED DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR IF THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, CIRCUMSTANCES OR

ESTIMATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE PERIOD FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR RECOGNIZING SALES AND PROFITS, SEE OUR DISCUSSION UNDER MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIESCONTRACT ACCOUNTING/PROGRAM ACCOUNTING ON PAGES 40-41 AND NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 51-52 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DISCOUNT RATES, ACTUAL INVESTMENT RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS, AND OTHER FACTORS COULD AFFECT OUR EARNINGS, EQUITY, AND

PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

OUR EARNINGS MAY BE

POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE AMOUNT OF INCOME OR EXPENSE WE RECORD FOR OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP) IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRE THAT WE CALCULATE INCOME

OR EXPENSE FOR THE PLANS USING ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. THESE VALUATIONS REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO FINANCIAL MARKET AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS CAN CHANGE THE ASSUMPTIONS. THE MOST

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SIGNIFICANT YEAR-END ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, AND EXPECTED FUTURE MEDICAL INFLATION. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO EQUITY THROUGH A REDUCTION OR

INCREASE TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING HOW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLAN ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIESPOSTRETIREMENT PLANS ON PAGES 43-44 OF THIS FORM 10-K. ALTHOUGH GAAP EXPENSE AND PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED, THE KEY ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT GAAP EXPENSE WOULD ALSO

LIKELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CASH THE COMPANY WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. POTENTIAL PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDE BOTH MANDATORY AMOUNTS REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AND

DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO IMPROVE THE PLANS FUNDED STATUS.

SOME OF OUR

WORKFORCE IS REPRESENTED BY LABOR UNIONS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO WORK STOPPAGES.

APPROXIMATELY 56,980 OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE UNIONIZED, WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 37% OF OUR EMPLOYEES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006. WE EXPERIENCED WORK STOPPAGES IN 2005 WHEN LABOR STRIKES HALTED COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND IDS

PRODUCTION AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL WORK STOPPAGES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW STABLE OUR RELATIONSHIPS, CURRENTLY WITH 17 DIFFERENT U.S. LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND 7 DIFFERENT NON-U.S. LABOR

ORGANIZATIONS, WILL BE OR WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THE UNIONS REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT IMPACTING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE UNIONS MAY ALSO LIMIT OUR FLEXIBILITY IN DEALING WITH OUR WORKFORCE. WORK STOPPAGES AND INSTABILITY IN OUR UNION

RELATIONSHIPS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE TIMELY PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD STRAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND CAUSE A LOSS OF REVENUES THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COMPETITION WITHIN OUR MARKETS MAY REDUCE OUR PROCUREMENT OF FUTURE CONTRACTS AND SALES.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR

COMPETITORS MAY HAVE MORE EXTENSIVE OR MORE SPECIALIZED ENGINEERING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING CAPABILITIES THAN WE DO IN SOME AREAS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR LARGEST CUSTOMERS COULD DEVELOP THE CAPABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS OR PROVIDE

SERVICES SIMILAR TO PRODUCTS THAT WE MANUFACTURE OR SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. THIS WOULD RESULT IN THESE CUSTOMERS SUPPLYING THEIR OWN PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AND COMPETING DIRECTLY WITH US FOR SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, ALL OF WHICH COULD

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES. FURTHERMORE, WE ARE FACING INCREASED INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION AND CROSS-BORDER CONSOLIDATION OF COMPETITION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST OUR CURRENT OR FUTURE

COMPETITORS OR THAT THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WE FACE WILL NOT RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUES AND MARKET SHARE.

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM NON-U.S. SALES AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

IN 2006 SALES TO NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 37% OF OUR REVENUES. WE EXPECT THAT NON-U.S. SALES WILL CONTINUE TO

ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING.

WHILE THESE FACTORS OR THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE FACTORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.

THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IN WHICH WE HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IS

UNPREDICTABLE AND AN ADVERSE DECISION IN ANY SUCH MATTER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS. THESE CLAIMS MAY DIVERT FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE USED TO BENEFIT OUR

OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE CLAIMS, NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE RESULTS OF THESE MATTERS WILL BE FAVORABLE TO US. AN ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THESE LAWSUITS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

AFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

A SUBSTANTIAL

DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY AS IT RELATES TO BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION (BCC) MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

BCC, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, HAS A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS PORTFOLIO

CONCENTRATED AMONG COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS. A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DEFAULTS BY AIRLINE CUSTOMERS, REPOSSESSIONS OF AIRCRAFT, AIRLINE BANKRUPTCIES, OR RESTRUCTURINGS. SEVERAL OF THE MAJOR

COMMERCIAL AIRLINES, INCLUDING DELTA AND NORTHWEST HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION. ADDITIONAL BANKRUPTCIES OR RESTRUCTURINGS OF OUR CURRENT OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED DEMAND FOR LEASED AIRCRAFT AND REDUCED AIRCRAFT LEASE

RATES. THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER ALL SIGNIFICANT RISK EXPOSURES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO LIABILITIES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE PROVIDE. WHILE WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN RISKS AND, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WE

MAY RECEIVE INDEMNIFICATION FROM THE U. S. GOVERNMENT, INSURANCE CANT BE OBTAINED TO PROTECT AGAINST ALL RISKS AND LIABILITIES. IT IS THEREFORE POSSIBLE THAT THE AMOUNT OF OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT COVER ALL CLAIMS OR LIABILITIES, AND WE

MAY BE FORCED TO BEAR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS.

OUR FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS,

PROJECTIONS AND BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS MAY PROVE TO BE INACCURATE, RESULTING IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED EARNINGS.

THE STATEMENTS IN THIS RISK FACTORS SECTION DESCRIBE THE MATERIAL RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY. IN ADDITION, THESE STATEMENTS CONSTITUTE OUR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE

PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. OUR DISCLOSURE AND ANALYSIS IN THIS REPORT AND IN OUR 2006 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS CONTAIN SOME FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS THAT SET FORTH ANTICIPATED RESULTS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS PLANS

MOST RUNWAYS AND TAXIWAYS THAT WE USE ARE LOCATED ON AIRPORT PROPERTIES OWNED BY OTHERS AND ARE USED JOINTLY WITH

OTHERS. OUR RIGHTS TO USE SUCH FACILITIES ARE PROVIDED FOR UNDER LONG-TERM LEASES WITH MUNICIPAL, COUNTY OR OTHER GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FURNISHES US CERTAIN OFFICE SPACE, INSTALLATIONS AND EQUIPMENT AT U.S.

GOVERNMENT BASES FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS CONTRACT ACTIVITIES.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR PRINCIPAL PROPERTIES ARE ADEQUATE FOR OUR PRESENT NEEDS AND, AS SUPPLEMENTED BY PLANNED IMPROVEMENTS AND CONSTRUCTION, EXPECT THEM TO REMAIN ADEQUATE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

CURRENTLY,

WE ARE A DEFENDANT IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF CONTINGENCIES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SEE NOTE 22 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

IN ADDITION, IN SEPTEMBER 2003, TWO VIRTUALLY IDENTICAL SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS

WERE FILED, AND LATER CONSOLIDATED, IN COOK COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT, ILLINOIS, AGAINST 11 OF OUR CURRENT AND FORMER DIRECTORS. WE WERE NAMED AS A NOMINAL DEFENDANT IN THE LITIGATION. OTHER SHAREHOLDERS, WHO HAD EARLIER SERVED DEMANDS UNDER

SECTION 220 OF THE DELAWARE CODE TO INSPECT OUR BOOKS AND RECORDS, INTERVENED IN THE LITIGATION. PLAINTIFFS IN THE CONSOLIDATED LITIGATION ALLEGED THAT THE DIRECTORS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES BY PERMITTING, OR FAILING TO REMEDY, CERTAIN

ALLEGED ETHICAL AND LEGAL VIOLATIONS BY EMPLOYEES IN OUR DEFENSE BUSINESSES OVER THE PERIOD 1989  2003. THE LAWSUIT SOUGHT AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AGAINST EACH DIRECTOR AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REMEDIAL MEASURES.

ALL PARTIES IN THE CONSOLIDATED LITIGATION HAVE REACHED A SETTLEMENT. UNDER THE TERMS

OF THE SETTLEMENT, WE HAVE AGREED TO ADOPT CERTAIN CORPORATE GOVERNANCE MEASURES THAT PROVIDE FOR AND SUPPORT BOARD OF DIRECTOR OVERSIGHT AND MONITORING OF OUR ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAM. WE ALSO COMMIT TO SPEND OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD $29

MILLION, IN EXCESS OF 2004 EXPENDITURE LEVELS FOR BOEINGS ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAM, TO IMPLEMENT THOSE MEASURES AND TO FURTHER ENHANCE OUR COMPLIANCE, RISK MANAGEMENT, AND INTERNAL GOVERNANCE FUNCTIONS AND PROCESSES.

ON DECEMBER 12, 2006, THE COURT APPROVED THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT, AWARDED

PLAINTIFFS ATTORNEYS $6 MILLION IN FEES AND EXPENSES, AND ENTERED FINAL JUDGMENT DISMISSING THE CONSOLIDATED ACTION WITH PREJUDICE.

THE COMPANY POSSESSES A NATIONAL POLLUTANT DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM (NPDES) PERMIT ALLOWING IT TO DISCHARGE INDUSTRIAL WASTE WATER AND SURFACE STORM WATER FROM

ITS SANTA SUSANA FIELD LABORATORY (SSFL) SITE IN SIMI VALLEY, CALIFORNIA. THE PERMIT REGULATES SURFACE WATER DISCHARGES AT VARIOUS LOCATIONS ON THE PROPERTY AND IMPOSES LIMITS ON THE PERMISSIBLE LEVELS OF CERTAIN CHEMICAL COMPOUNDS IN THE

DISCHARGES. IN JULY 2004 AND AGAIN IN JANUARY AND MARCH 2006, THE CALIFORNIA REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD, LOS ANGELES REGION (REGIONAL BOARD), AMENDED OUR 1998 NPDES PERMIT FOR THE SSFL SITE. THE AMENDMENTS IMPOSED INCREASINGLY MORE

STRINGENT NUMERIC SURFACE WATER DISCHARGE LIMITS. BOEING APPEALED THE PERMIT AMENDMENTS TO THE CALIFORNIA WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD (STATE BOARD) IN EARLY 2006. IN DECEMBER 2006, THE STATE BOARD ISSUED ITS ORDER ON BOEINGS APPEAL OF THE

SURFACE WATER PERMIT. THE ORDER REMANDS THE MATTER TO THE REGIONAL BOARD TO ESTABLISH A COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE, BUT UPHOLDS THE REGIONAL BOARDS INCLUSION OF THE LIMITS IN THE PERMIT. ON JANUARY 17 2007, THE COMPANY FILED A PETITION FOR A

WRIT CHALLENGING THE STATE BOARDS ADVERSE RULINGS IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT (AN EARLIER COURT ACTION CHALLENGING THE BOARDS REFUSAL TO STAY ENFORCEMENT OF THE PERMIT LIMITS PENDING THE STATE BOARDS ACTION ON THE APPEAL

WAS DISMISSED AS MOOT ON JANUARY 5, 2007).

IN THE PERIOD 2004 TO

THE PRESENT, WE HAVE RECEIVED FIVE VIOLATION NOTICES FOR EXCEEDING PERMISSIBLE LIMITS UNDER OUR NPDES PERMIT. FOR EACH NOTICE OF VIOLATION, BOEING MAY BE SUBJECT TO ADMINISTRATIVE

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PENALTIES OF UP TO $10,000 PER VIOLATION AND AN ADDITIONAL CHARGE BASED ON THE VOLUME OF WATER DISCHARGED. NO SUCH PENALTIES HAVE BEEN ASSESSED. IN NOVEMBER 2005, THE

U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE IN LOS ANGELES SERVED US WITH A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA SEEKING DOCUMENTS PERTAINING TO BOEINGS COMPLIANCE WITH THE NPDES PERMIT DURING THE PERIOD 2001 TO THE PRESENT AND SUBSEQUENTLY ALLEGED THAT WE HAVE VIOLATED THE

FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT. WE ARE COMPLETING DOCUMENT PRODUCTION PURSUANT TO THE SUBPOENA AND INTEND TO ENGAGE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE REGARDING THE BASIS FOR OUR BELIEF THAT NO CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS OF THE ACT OCCURRED, AND

THAT, EVEN IF VIOLATIONS HAD OCCURRED, PROSECUTION WOULD BE INAPPROPRIATE.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW

WE ARE A GLOBAL MARKET LEADER IN DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, SALE AND SUPPORT OF COMMERCIAL JETLINERS, MILITARY AIRCRAFT, SATELLITES, MISSILE DEFENSE, HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT AND LAUNCH SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. WE ARE ONE OF

THE TWO MAJOR MANUFACTURERS OF 100+ SEAT AIRPLANES FOR THE WORLDWIDE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY AND THE SECOND-LARGEST DEFENSE CONTRACTOR IN THE U.S. WHILE OUR PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS ARE IN THE U.S., WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON A NETWORK OF PARTNERS, KEY

SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS LOCATED AROUND THE WORLD.

OUR BUSINESS

STRATEGY IS CENTERED ON SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION IN HEALTHY CORE BUSINESSES  COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES AND INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS (IDS)  SUPPLEMENTED AND SUPPORTED BY BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION (BCC). TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE CORE BUSINESSES

GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW THAT PERMIT US TO INVEST IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT OPEN NEW FRONTIERS IN AEROSPACE. WE FOCUS ON PRODUCING THE AIRPLANES THE MARKET DEMANDS AND WE PRICE OUR PRODUCTS TO PROVIDE A FAIR RETURN FOR OUR

SHAREHOLDERS WHILE CONTINUING TO FIND NEW WAYS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY. IDS IS A DEFENSE SYSTEMS BUSINESS THAT INTEGRATES ITS RESOURCES IN DEFENSE, INTELLIGENCE, COMMUNICATIONS AND SPACE TO DELIVER CAPABILITY-DRIVEN SOLUTIONS TO ITS

CUSTOMERS AT REDUCED COSTS. OUR STRATEGY IS TO LEVERAGE OUR CORE BUSINESSES WITH A SIMULTANEOUSLY INTENSE FOCUS ON GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY. OUR STRATEGY ALSO BENEFITS AS COMMERCIAL AND DEFENSE MARKETS OFTEN OFFSET EACH OTHERS CYCLICALITY. BCC

DELIVERS VALUE THROUGH SUPPORTING OUR BUSINESS UNITS AND MANAGING OVERALL FINANCIAL EXPOSURES.

IN 2006, OUR REVENUES GREW BY 15 PERCENT. EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED 7%. WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN KEY GROWTH PROGRAMS AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE GREW BY 48% TO $3.3 BILLION, REFLECTING INCREASED SPENDING ON

THE 787 AND 747-8 PROGRAMS AND LOWER COST SHARING PAYMENTS FROM SUPPLIERS. WE GENERATED OPERATING CASH FLOW OF $7.5 BILLION DRIVEN BY OPERATING AND WORKING CAPITAL PERFORMANCE. WE REDUCED DEBT BY $1.2 BILLION AND REPURCHASED 25 MILLION COMMON

SHARES. OUR CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG GREW 35% TO $217 BILLION, DRIVEN BY 40% GROWTH AT COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES WHILE OUR TOTAL BACKLOG GREW 22% TO $250 BILLION. AT THE END OF 2006, WE IMPLEMENTED NEW ACCOUNTING RULES FOR PENSIONS AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT

BENEFITS, WHICH TOGETHER WITH THE ANNUAL REMEASUREMENT OF OUR PENSION PLANS REDUCED OUR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY BY $6.5 BILLION. THIS DECREASE DID NOT AFFECT CASH FLOWS OR THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR BENEFIT PLANS.

WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE REVENUES AND DELIVERIES AS WE EXECUTE

OUR RECORD BACKLOG AND RESPOND TO GLOBAL DEMAND BY RAMPING UP COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION. WE EXPECT IDS REVENUE TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER IN 2007 AND ANTICIPATE THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (U.S. DOD) BUDGET GROWTH WILL MODERATE OVER THE NEXT

SEVERAL YEARS. WE ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PRODUCTIVITY AND CUSTOMER-FOCUSED GROWTH.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HIGHER CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2006 WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NEW COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES. IDS REVENUES

WERE UP MODERATELY IN 2006 AS GROWTH IN PRECISION ENGAGEMENT AND MOBILITY SYSTEMS AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VOLUME IN NETWORK AND SPACE SYSTEMS. BCC REVENUES INCREASED IN 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INVESTMENT INCOME AND

HIGHER NET GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS. OTHER SEGMENT REVENUES DECREASED IN 2006 AS A RESULT OF THE BUYOUT OF SEVERAL OPERATING LEASE AIRCRAFT IN THE AMOUNT OF $369 MILLION IN 2005. IN ADDITION, REVENUES DECREASED IN ACCOUNTING

DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS DUE TO HIGHER COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES INTERCOMPANY DELIVERIES IN 2006.

CONSOLIDATED REVENUES ALSO INCREASED IN 2005 AS COMPARED TO 2004. THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO THE GROWTH AT COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES DRIVEN BY HIGHER NEW AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES, INCREASED SPARES AND AIRCRAFT MODIFICATIONS, AND HIGHER USED

AIRCRAFT SALES. IDS REVENUES REMAINED STABLE IN 2005 AFTER STRONG GROWTH IN 2004. BCC REVENUES FOR 2005 WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM 2004.

OUR EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS

INCREASED IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY IMPROVED EARNINGS AT COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES AND LOWER UNALLOCATED EXPENSE. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $571 MILLION CHARGE FOR GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (SEE NOTE 22),

LOWER IDS EARNINGS REFLECTING A $569 MILLION NET GAIN ON THE SALE OF OUR ROCKETDYNE BUSINESS IN 2005 AND $770 MILLION OF CHARGES ON THE AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING & CONTROL (AEW&C) DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IN 2006 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED MARGINS

ON OTHER PROGRAMS AND A $320 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO THE EXIT OF THE CONNEXION BY BOEING BUSINESS RECORDED IN OTHER SEGMENT (SEE NOTE 9).

AN INCREASE IN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2005 COMPARED TO 2004 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO STRONG OPERATING PERFORMANCE BY OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

HIGHER UNALLOCATED EXPENSE. INCLUDED IN 2004 RESULTS IS A CHARGE OF $555 MILLION RELATED TO THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE (USAF) 767 TANKER PROGRAM AND EXPENSES INCURRED TO END PRODUCTION OF THE 717 AIRCRAFT.

RESPECTIVELY. A PORTION OF PENSION EXPENSE IS RECORDED IN THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE REMAINDER IS INCLUDED IN UNALLOCATED PENSION EXPENSE.

UNALLOCATED PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT EXPENSE REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COSTS RECOGNIZED UNDER GAAP IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

FEDERAL COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS REQUIRED TO BE UTILIZED BY OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING PURPOSES. NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST RELATED TO PENSIONS DECREASED IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005 MAINLY DUE TO AN ABSENCE OF NET SETTLEMENT

AND CURTAILMENT CHARGES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF ACTUARIAL LOSS THAT WAS AMORTIZED. THE INCREASE IN 2006 AND 2005 DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OUR STOCK PRICE.

HIGHER PENSION AND POST-RETIREMENT AMOUNTS IN 2005 COMPARED TO 2004 ARE PRIMARILY

RELATED TO HIGHER AMORTIZATION OF ACTUARIAL LOSSES AND NET SETTLEMENT AND CURTAILMENT CHARGES DUE TO 2005 DIVESTITURES. THE INCREASE IN 2005 SHARE-BASED PLANS EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OUR STOCK PRICE WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL

COMPENSATION EXPENSE DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARES MEETING THE PRICE GROWTH TARGETS AND BEING CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK.

INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE DECREASED IN 2006 AND 2005 DUE TO DEBT

REPAYMENTS.

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 30.9% FOR 2006 DIFFERED

FROM THE 2005 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 9.1% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAVORABLE 2005 SETTLEMENT WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND THE NON-DEDUCTION IN 2006 OF THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX

RATE OF 9.1% FOR 2005 WAS COMPARABLE TO THE 2004 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 7.1%. BOTH 2005 AND 2004 BENEFITED FROM AUDIT SETTLEMENTS AND EXPORT TAX BENEFITS. 2006 IS THE FINAL YEAR FOR RECOGNIZING EXPORT TAX BENEFITS. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION

SEGMENT RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

AIRLINE INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT

AIR TRAVEL GROWTH IS DRIVEN BY A COMBINATION OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE INCREASING PROPENSITY TO

TRAVEL DUE TO INCREASED TRADE, GLOBALIZATION AND IMPROVED AIRLINE SERVICES DRIVEN BY LIBERALIZATION OF AIR TRAFFIC RIGHTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES. AIR TRAFFIC GROWTH CONTINUES TO EXCEED ITS LONG-TERM TREND DUE TO STRONG PERFORMANCE OF THESE KEY DRIVERS.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF AIR TRAFFIC GROWTH, REMAINED ABOVE LONG-TERM TREND FOR THE THIRD STRAIGHT YEAR IN 2006. EVIDENCE OF INCREASING LIBERALIZATION CAN BE SEEN IN THE DECLINING RESTRICTIONS ON FLIGHTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES,

INCREASING PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF AIRLINES AND REDUCED REGULATION OF COMPETITION WITHIN MARKETS.

LOOKING FORWARD, OUR 20-YEAR FORECAST IS FOR A LONG-TERM AVERAGE GROWTH RATE OF 5% PER YEAR FOR PASSENGER TRAFFIC, AND 6% PER YEAR FOR CARGO TRAFFIC BASED ON PROJECTED AVERAGE ANNUAL WORLDWIDE REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH

RATE OF 3%. BASED ON LONG-TERM GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH PROJECTIONS, AND FACTORING IN INCREASING UTILIZATION OF THE WORLDWIDE AIRPLANE FLEET AND REQUIREMENTS TO REPLACE OLDER AIRPLANES, WE PROJECT A $2.6 TRILLION MARKET FOR 27,200 NEW AIRPLANES OVER

THE NEXT 20 YEARS.

THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY

COMPETITIVE RESULTING IN AIRLINES FOCUSING ON INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY AND IMPROVING SERVICE LEVELS. AIRLINES ARE CHANGING MANY ASPECTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS INCLUDING SIMPLIFYING FLEETS, DISTRIBUTION, AND PRICING; OUTSOURCING NON-ESSENTIAL OPERATIONS;

REDUCING LABOR COSTS AND AIRPORT COSTS; INCREASING ASSET UTILIZATION; AND DEVELOPING NEW BUSINESS MODELS THROUGH INNOVATIONS IN NETWORK STRUCTURE, FARE STRUCTURES, SERVICE LEVELS AND DISTRIBUTION NETWORKS. SUCH CHANGES ARE PROVIDING NEW

OPPORTUNITIES FOR AIRLINE INDUSTRY SUPPLIERS.

WORLDWIDE, MANY AIRLINES

CONTINUE REPORTING OPERATING PROFITS ALTHOUGH PERFORMANCE VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY BY REGION AND BUSINESS MODEL. RECENT INDUSTRY FINANCIALS GENERALLY SHOW INCREASING UNIT REVENUES AND RISING FARES. COST-CUTTING INITIATIVES AND EFFICIENCY IMPROVEMENTS

ARE HELPING MANY AIRLINES REMAIN PROFITABLE DESPITE INTENSE COMPETITION AND HIGH FUEL PRICES. FUEL COSTS NOW COMPRISE ONE QUARTER OF AIRLINE OPERATING COSTS COMPARED TO LESS THAN 15% THREE YEARS AGO. OVERALL, THE INDUSTRY IS FORECAST TO LOSE HALF A

BILLION DOLLARS IN 2006, BUT RETURN TO PROFITABILITY IN 2007. MANY AIRLINES THAT ARE GROWING TO MEET INCREASED DEMAND ARE ACQUIRING NEW CAPACITY FROM MANUFACTURERS.

THE INDUSTRY REMAINS VULNERABLE TO NEAR-TERM EXOGENOUS DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING DISEASE OUTBREAKS (SUCH AS AVIAN FLU), THE THREAT OF

TERRORISM, GLOBAL ECONOMIC IMBALANCES, INCREASING GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS AND FUEL PRICES. FUEL PRICES ARE FORECAST TO REMAIN ELEVATED AND VOLATILE IN THE NEAR-TERM DUE TO STRONG DEMAND DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC GROWTH AND MINIMAL SURPLUS CAPACITY TO

CUSHION AGAINST SUPPLY SHOCKS.

INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS

THE

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT MARKET AND THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REMAIN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT THE EXISTING LONG-TERM DOWNWARD TREND IN PASSENGER REVENUE YIELDS WORLDWIDE (MEASURED IN REAL TERMS) TO CONTINUE INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. MARKET

LIBERALIZATION IN EUROPE AND ASIA HAS CONTINUED TO ENABLE LOW-COST AIRLINES TO GAIN MARKET SHARE. THESE AIRLINES HAVE INCREASED THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON AIRFARES. THIS RESULTS IN CONTINUED COST PRESSURES FOR ALL AIRLINES AND PRICE PRESSURE ON OUR

PRODUCTS. MAJOR PRODUCTIVITY GAINS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE A FAVORABLE MARKET POSITION AT ACCEPTABLE PROFIT MARGINS.

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTINUED ACCESS TO GLOBAL MARKETS REMAINS VITAL TO OUR ABILITY TO FULLY REALIZE OUR SALES POTENTIAL AND LONG-TERM

INVESTMENT RETURNS. APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SALES AND CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG ARE FROM CUSTOMERS BASED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE FACE AGGRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS WHO ARE INTENT ON INCREASING THEIR MARKET SHARE. THEY OFFER COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND HAVE ACCESS TO MOST OF THE SAME

CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. AIRBUS HAS HISTORICALLY INVESTED HEAVILY TO CREATE A FAMILY OF PRODUCTS TO COMPETE WITH OURS. REGIONAL JET MAKERS EMBRAER AND BOMBARDIER, COMING FROM THE LESS THAN 100-SEAT COMMERCIAL JET MARKET, CONTINUE TO DEVELOP LARGER

AND MORE CAPABLE AIRPLANES. THIS MARKET ENVIRONMENT HAS RESULTED IN INTENSE PRESSURES ON PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

WORLDWIDE, AIRPLANE SALES ARE GENERALLY CONDUCTED IN U.S. DOLLARS. FLUCTUATING EXCHANGE RATES AFFECT THE PROFIT POTENTIAL OF OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS, ALL OF WHOM HAVE

SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN OTHER CURRENCIES. A DECLINE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO THEIR LOCAL CURRENCIES PUTS PRESSURE ON COMPETITORS REVENUES AND PROFITS. COMPETITORS OFTEN RESPOND BY AGGRESSIVELY REDUCING COSTS AND INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY,

THEREBY IMPROVING THEIR LONGER-TERM COMPETITIVE POSTURE. AIRBUS HAS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED SUCH INITIATIVES TARGETING A TWO-YEAR REDUCTION IN ITS DEVELOPMENT CYCLE AND A 20% INCREASE IN OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY BY 2010. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS,

AIRBUS CAN USE THE EXTRA EFFICIENCY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND GAIN MARKET SHARE.

WE ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OUR PROCESSES AND CONTINUING COST-REDUCTION EFFORTS. WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE OUR EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES NETWORK WHICH INCLUDES AVIATION SUPPORT, SPARES, TRAINING, MAINTENANCE DOCUMENTS

AND TECHNICAL ADVICE FOR AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THIS ENABLES US TO PROVIDE A HIGHER LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND PRODUCTIVITY. THESE EFFORTS ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE PRICING STRATEGIES THAT ENABLE US TO PRICE COMPETITIVELY AND

MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY MARGINS.

NOTE: IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES CHANGED ITS ACCOUNTING POLICY FOR CONCESSIONS RECEIVED FROM VENDORS. THE YEARS 2005 AND 2004 WERE RETROACTIVELY

ADJUSTED FOR COMPARATIVE PURPOSES. SEE NOTE 1.

REVENUES

THE INCREASE IN REVENUE OF APPROXIMATELY $7,100 MILLION IN 2006 FROM 2005 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER NEW AIRPLANE DELIVERIES, INCLUDING MODEL MIX CHANGES, OF $6,820 MILLION, INCREASED AIRCRAFT MODIFICATION AND

SPARES BUSINESS OF $873 MILLION OFFSET BY $593 MILLION PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM AIRCRAFT TRADING.

THE INCREASE IN REVENUE OF $1,440 MILLION IN 2005 FROM 2004 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER NEW AIRPLANE DELIVERIES, INCLUDING MODEL MIX CHANGES, OF $845

MILLION, USED AIRPLANE SALES OF $302 MILLION AND $293 MILLION PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AIRCRAFT MODIFICATION, AND SPARES.

INCREASED DELIVERIES IN 2005 WERE ACHIEVED DESPITE DELIVERING 29 FEWER THAN EXPECTED AIRPLANES DUE TO THE IAM STRIKE DURING THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 2005. THIS

RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY $2,000 MILLION LOWER REVENUE THAN ANTICIPATED FOR 2005.

EARNINGS FROM

OPERATIONS

THE $1,302 MILLION INCREASE IN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2006 OVER THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF 2005 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO EARNINGS OF $1,781 MILLION ON INCREASED REVENUE FROM NEW AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES AND $315 MILLION IN

INCREASED EARNINGS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AIRCRAFT MODIFICATIONS. IN ADDITION COST PERFORMANCE IMPROVED BY $226 MILLION. SUCH ITEMS WERE OFFSET BY INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF $1,088 MILLION. IN 2005 WE HAD A LOSS ON THE SALE OF

WICHITA, KANSAS AND TULSA AND MCALESTER, OKLAHOMA OPERATIONS OF $68 MILLION. THE IAM STRIKE RESULTED IN LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2005 DUE TO 29 FEWER THAN EXPECTED AIRPLANE DELIVERIES.

THE $686 MILLION INCREASE IN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2005 OVER THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF 2004 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

EARNINGS ON INCREASED REVENUE FROM NEW AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES OF $265 MILLION AND $135 MILLION OF INCREASED REVENUE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO AIRCRAFT MODIFICATION. IN ADDITION, MARGIN IMPROVED $414 MILLION MAINLY DUE TO IMPROVED COST PERFORMANCE,

WHICH WAS OFFSET BY INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF $361 MILLION AND OTHER PERIOD COSTS OF $174 MILLION, AND A LOSS ON THE SALE OF WICHITA, TULSA AND MCALESTER OPERATIONS OF $68 MILLION. IN 2004, WE ALSO HAD CHARGES OF $280 MILLION

RESULTING FROM THE DECISION TO COMPLETE PRODUCTION OF THE 717 PROGRAM AND $195 MILLION OF THE 767 USAF TANKER PROGRAM CHARGE.

BACKLOG

THE BACKLOG INCREASE IN 2006 RELATED TO ORDERS IN EXCESS OF DELIVERIES FOR 737NG, 747 AND 787, WHILE THE INCREASE IN 2005 RELATED TO ORDERS IN EXCESS

OF DELIVERIES FOR 737NG, 777 AND 787.

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY

THE

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY IS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE QUANTITY OF AIRPLANES THAT WILL BE PRODUCED FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. IT IS A KEY DETERMINANT OF GROSS MARGINS WE RECOGNIZE ON SALES OF INDIVIDUAL AIRPLANES THROUGHOUT A

PROGRAMS LIFE. ESTIMATION OF EACH PROGRAMS ACCOUNTING QUANTITY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SEVERAL FACTORS THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF THE DEMAND FOR THAT PROGRAM, INCLUDING FIRM ORDERS, LETTERS OF INTENT FROM PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS, AND MARKET

STUDIES. WE REVIEW OUR PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITIES QUARTERLY.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION COSTS INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS, A PORTION OF WHICH DO NOT VARY WITH PRODUCTION RATES. AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME NEEDED TO PRODUCE THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY DECREASES, THE AVERAGE COST OF

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY ALSO DECREASES AS THESE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL COST ESTIMATES, THUS INCREASING THE GROSS MARGIN AND RELATED EARNINGS PROVIDED OTHER FACTORS DO NOT CHANGE.

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH PROGRAM MAY INCLUDE UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED, UNDELIVERED UNITS UNDER

CONTRACT, AND UNITS ANTICIPATED TO BE UNDER CONTRACT IN THE REASONABLE FUTURE (ANTICIPATED ORDERS). IN DEVELOPING TOTAL PROGRAM ESTIMATES ALL OF THESE ITEMS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY MUST BE CONSIDERED. THE TABLE BELOW PROVIDES DETAILS AS OF

FIRM ORDERS REPRESENT NEW AIRCRAFT PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WHERE THE CUSTOMERS RIGHTS TO CANCEL WITHOUT

PENALTY HAVE EXPIRED. TYPICALLY CUSTOMER RIGHTS TO CANCEL WITHOUT PENALTY INCLUDE THE CUSTOMER RECEIVING APPROVAL FROM ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, GOVERNMENT AND COMPLETING FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. ALL SUCH CANCELLATION RIGHTS MUST BE

SATISFIED OR EXPIRED PRIOR TO RECORDING A FIRM ORDER EVEN IF SATISFYING SUCH CONDITIONS ARE HIGHLY CERTAIN. FIRM ORDERS EXCLUDE OPTION AIRCRAFT AND AIRCRAFT WITH CANCELLATION RIGHTS.

CUMULATIVE FIRM ORDERS REPRESENT THE CUMULATIVE NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES PLUS UNDELIVERED

FIRM ORDERS.

737 NEXT-GENERATION

THE ACCOUNTING

QUANTITY FOR THE 737 NEXT-GENERATION PROGRAM INCREASED BY 400 UNITS DURING 2006 DUE TO THE PROGRAMS NORMAL PROGRESSION OF OBTAINING ADDITIONAL ORDERS AND DELIVERING AIRCRAFT.

747 PROGRAM

IN NOVEMBER 2005, WE LAUNCHED THE 747-8 FAMILY, WHICH INCLUDES THE 747-8 INTERCONTINENTAL PASSENGER AIRPLANE AND

THE 747-8 FREIGHTER. THIS LAUNCH AND ADDITIONAL FIRM ORDERS HAVE EXTENDED THE LIFE OF THIS PROGRAM AND HAVE ALSO SOLIDIFIED PRODUCT STRATEGY. THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 747 PROGRAM INCREASED BY 25 UNITS DURING 2006. DURING 2006 WE COMPLETED

FIRM CONFIGURATION OF THE 747-8 FREIGHTER AND THE SAME IS EXPECTED FOR THE PASSENGER VERSION IN 2007. DELIVERIES OF THE FIRST 747-8 FREIGHTER AND INTERCONTINENTAL PASSENGER AIRPLANE ARE TARGETED FOR LATE 2009 AND LATE 2010.

767 PROGRAM

DURING 2005 AND 2006 THE 767 PROGRAM OBTAINED ADDITIONAL ORDERS,

INCLUDING 10 FIRM ORDERS DURING 2006. IN ADDITION, ON FEBRUARY 5, 2007, A CUSTOMER ANNOUNCED ITS PLANS TO ORDER 27 767-300 EXTENDED RANGE FREIGHTERS. WE CONTINUE PURSUING MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR ADDITIONAL 767 SALES.

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

777 PROGRAM

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 777 PROGRAM INCREASED BY 100 UNITS DURING 2006 AS A RESULT OF

THE PROGRAMS NORMAL PROGRESSION OF OBTAINING ADDITIONAL ORDERS AND DELIVERING AIRCRAFT.

787 PROGRAM

AS WE PROGRESS TOWARD FIRST FLIGHT AND ENTRY INTO SERVICE OF THE 787, WE CONTINUE TO MANAGE PRESSURES WITH RESPECT TO WEIGHT, SCHEDULE, AND SUPPLIER IMPLEMENTATION AS THEY ARISE. THERE ARE INHERENT RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF ANY NEW AIRPLANE, WHICH CAN IMPACT EXPECTATIONS. BUT WE STILL CONTINUE TO EXPECT DELIVERY OF THE 787 ON SCHEDULE AND IN ACCORDANCE WITH OUR CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS. WE ARE PREPARING FOR THE FIRST

TEST FLIGHT OF THE 787 IN 2007, AND FOR ENTRY INTO SERVICE IN 2008.

A

KEY MILESTONE OF THE PROGRAM WAS ACHIEVED IN 2006 WITH THE INITIAL FLIGHT OF THE FIRST 747-400 LARGE CARGO FREIGHTER (LCF), CALLED THE DREAMLIFTER. THESE SPECIALLY-MODIFIED FREIGHTERS WILL TRANSPORT MAJOR COMPOSITE STRUCTURES OF THE 787 AIRPLANES.

OTHER KEY EVENTS DURING 2006 WERE THE FIRST SHIPMENT OF A MAJOR ASSEMBLY BETWEEN SUPPLIER PARTNERS AND THE INTRODUCTION OF A DIGITAL COMPUTER SIMULATION OF THE ENTIRE 787 PRODUCTION AND ASSEMBLY PROCESS.

COMPLETED PROGRAMS

717 PROGRAM

ON JANUARY 12, 2005, WE ANNOUNCED OUR DECISION TO COMPLETE PRODUCTION OF THE 717 AIRCRAFT DURING 2006 DUE TO

THE LACK OF OVERALL MARKET DEMAND. THE FINAL 717 WAS DELIVERED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006.

757 PROGRAM

PRODUCTION OF THE 757 PROGRAM ENDED IN OCTOBER 2004. THE LAST AIRCRAFT WAS DELIVERED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005.

FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION REGARDING TERMINATION LIABILITIES REMAINING IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES FOR THESE TWO PROGRAMS SEE NOTE 23.

DEFERRED PRODUCTION COSTS

DEFERRED PRODUCTION COSTS REPRESENT COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT INVENTORY PRODUCTION COSTS INCURRED ON IN-PROCESS AND DELIVERED UNITS IN EXCESS OF THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE COST OF SUCH UNITS USING PROGRAM ACCOUNTING. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005 DEFERRED PRODUCTION COSTS RELATE TO THE 777 PROGRAM

AND THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT EXCESS DEFERRED PRODUCTION COSTS OR UNAMORTIZED TOOLING COSTS NOT RECOVERABLE FROM EXISTING FIRM ORDERS.

THE DEFERRED PRODUCTION COSTS AND UNAMORTIZED TOOLING INCLUDED IN THE 777 PROGRAMS INVENTORY AT DECEMBER 31 ARE SUMMARIZED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE.

FLEET SUPPORT

WE PROVIDE THE OPERATORS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES WITH

ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES TO FACILITATE EFFICIENT AND SAFE AIRCRAFT OPERATION. COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS FLEET SUPPORT SERVICES, THESE ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES BEGIN PRIOR TO AIRCRAFT DELIVERY AND CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE OPERATIONAL LIFE OF THE AIRCRAFT.

THEY INCLUDE FLIGHT AND MAINTENANCE TRAINING, FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT COSTS, ENGINEERING SERVICES AND TECHNICAL DATA AND DOCUMENTS. THE COSTS FOR FLEET SUPPORT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY LESS THAN 1.5% OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED

COSTS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THIS LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES IS ANTICIPATED TO CONTINUE IN THE UPCOMING YEARS. THESE COSTS DO NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY WITH CURRENT PRODUCTION RATES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE FOLLOWING CHART SUMMARIZES THE TIME HORIZON BETWEEN GO-AHEAD AND

CERTIFICATION/INITIAL DELIVERY FOR MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES DERIVATIVES AND PROGRAMS.

OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE

INCREASED $1,088 MILLION AND $361 MILLION IN 2006 AND 2005. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IS NET OF DEVELOPMENT COST SHARING PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS. THE INCREASE IN 2006 WAS DUE TO HIGHER SPENDING OF $636 MILLION, PRIMARILY ON 787 AND

747-8, AND $452 MILLION OF LOWER SUPPLIER DEVELOPMENT COST SHARING PAYMENTS. THE INCREASE DURING 2005 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SPENDING ON THE 787 PROGRAM AND WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SUPPLIER DEVELOPMENT COST SHARING PAYMENTS. DURING THE

SECOND AND THIRD QUARTERS OF 2006, WE INCREASED OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE FORECASTS FOR 2006 AND 2007 TO REFLECT INCREASING PRESSURES ON THE 787 PROGRAM AS WELL AS MODIFIED AND INCREASED SCOPE ON THE 747-8 PROGRAM TO SUPPORT CUSTOMER

EXPECTATIONS. WE ARE ALSO CONTINUING TO DEVELOP DERIVATIVES AND FEATURES FOR OUR OTHER PROGRAMS PRIMARILY THE 737 AND 777 PROGRAMS.

INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

IDS

CONSISTS OF THREE CAPABILITIES-DRIVEN BUSINESSES: PRECISION ENGAGEMENT AND MOBILITY SYSTEMS (PE&MS), NETWORK AND SPACE SYSTEMS (N&SS), AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS.

DEFENSE ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

THE U.S. IS FACED WITH CONTINUOUS FORCE DEPLOYMENTS OVERSEAS, STABILITY OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN

AND IRAQ, AND THE REQUIREMENT BOTH TO RECAPITALIZE IMPORTANT DEFENSE CAPABILITIES AND TO TRANSFORM THE FORCE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES TO MEET THE CHANGING NATIONAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT AS OUTLINED IN THE 2006 QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE

REVIEW REPORT (QDR). ALL OF THIS MUST BE CARRIED OUT AGAINST A BACKDROP OF SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICITS AND AN ADMINISTRATION PLEDGE TO REDUCE AND ULTIMATELY ELIMINATE ANNUAL DEFICIT SPENDING. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY

ENVIRONMENT WILL REMAIN CHALLENGING FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT DECADE.

BECAUSE U.S. DOD SPENDING MAKES UP ABOUT HALF OF WORLDWIDE DEFENSE SPENDING AND REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 84% OF IDS REVENUE IN 2006, THE TRENDS AND DRIVERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE U.S. DOD BUDGET ARE CRITICAL. THE U.S. DOD BUDGET HAS GROWN

SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE PAST DECADE, PARTICULARLY AFTER THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. ALTHOUGH THE GROWTH RATE HAD MODERATED IN RECENT YEARS, THE 2008 SUBMITTAL EQUATES TO AN 11% INCREASE OVER THE PROJECTED 2007 ENACTED LEVEL. THE

PRESIDENTS REQUEST FOR FISCAL YEAR 2008 IS $481 BILLION, EXCLUDING THE ADDITIONAL $142 BILLION REQUEST TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR (GWOT) IN FISCAL YEAR 2008. IN THE PAST EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTALS HAD BEEN USED TO COVER THE

ON-GOING COSTS OF THE GWOT. IN ADDITION TO THE FISCAL YEAR 2008 BUDGET REQUEST THE PRESIDENT ALSO SUBMITTED A FISCAL YEAR 2007 EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL REQUESTING $93 BILLION TO COVER OPERATIONS IN THE GWOT FOR THE REMAINDER OF FISCAL YEAR 2007. THIS

SUPPLEMENTAL IS IN ADDITION TO THE $70 BILLION PREVIOUSLY PROVIDED BY CONGRESS. THE PROCUREMENT ACCOUNT CONTINUES TO SEE GROWTH WITH A REQUEST OF $102 BILLION, A 25% INCREASE OVER 2007, WHILE THE

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, TEST & EVALUATION (RDT&E) ACCOUNT REMAINS FLAT AT $75 BILLION. (ALL PROJECTIONS AND PERCENTAGE INCREASES ARE MADE WITHOUT TAKING

INFLATION INTO ACCOUNT AND WITHOUT ACCOUNTING FOR SUPPLEMENTAL FUNDING.)

EVEN THOUGH WE CONTINUE TO SEE SOME GROWTH IN THE U.S. DOD BUDGET, IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE U.S. DOD WILL BE ABLE TO FULLY FUND THE HARDWARE PROGRAMS ALREADY IN DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS NEW INITIATIVES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE CAPABILITY GAPS

IDENTIFIED IN THE 2006 QDR. THIS IMBALANCE BETWEEN FUTURE COSTS OF HARDWARE PROGRAMS AND EXPECTED FUNDING LEVELS IS NOT UNCOMMON IN THE U.S. DOD AND IS ROUTINELY MANAGED BY INTERNALLY ADJUSTING PRIORITIES AND SCHEDULES, RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS, AND

LENGTHENING PRODUCTION RUNS TO MEET THE CONSTRAINTS OF AVAILABLE FUNDING. WE EXPECT THE U.S. DOD WILL RESPOND TO FUTURE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS BY FOCUSING ON AFFORDABILITY STRATEGIES THAT EMPHASIZE JOINTNESS, NETWORK-CENTRIC OPERATIONS, PERSISTENT

INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE, LONG-RANGE STRIKE, SPECIAL OPERATIONS, UNMANNED SYSTEMS, PRECISION GUIDED KINETIC AND NON-KINETIC WEAPONS, AND CONTINUED PRIVATIZATION OF LOGISTICS AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE OVERALL

EFFECTIVENESS WHILE MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER COSTS.

CONSOLIDATION OF

CONTRACTOR-PROVIDED U.S. GOVERNMENT LAUNCH CAPABILITIES WAS COMPLETED WITH THE FORMATION OF THE UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE L.L.C. (ULA) JOINT VENTURE IN 2006. THIS CONSOLIDATION WAS DRIVEN BY THE LIMITED SCHEDULE OF GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES AS WELL AS THE

DOWNTURN IN THE COMMERCIAL LAUNCH MARKET. LAUNCH CONTRACTORS HAD BUILT BUSINESS CASES AROUND THE GOVERNMENT MARKET BEING SUPPLEMENTED BY A ROBUST COMMERCIAL MARKET, BUT AS THE COMMERCIAL MARKET DECLINED THESE BUSINESS CASES WERE RE-EVALUATED. THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS AN ASSURED ACCESS TO SPACE POLICY WHICH REQUIRES THAT TWO SEPARATE VEHICLES BE AVAILABLE FOR USE. THE ULA JOINT VENTURE IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE THIS ASSURANCE.

CIVIL SPACE TRANSPORTATION AND EXPLORATION ENVIRONMENT

NASA HAS HAD STABLE BUT VERY LITTLE GROWTH IN THEIR FUNDING IN THIS

DECADE. NASAS FISCAL YEAR 2006 APPROPRIATION OF $16.6 BILLION WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE FISCAL YEAR 2005 FUNDING LEVEL, AND PRESENTLY THE AGENCY IS OPERATING UNDER A CONTINUING RESOLUTION IN 2007. NASAS BUDGET REMAINS

FOCUSED ON NEEDED FUNDS FOR SPACE SHUTTLE OPERATIONS, INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, AND NEW INITIATIVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE VISION FOR SPACE EXPLORATION. WE ANTICIPATE FUNDING LEVELS TO REMAIN IN THE $16 BILLION RANGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. NASA IS

CONTINUING TO PURSUE ELEMENTS OF THE VISION FOR SPACE EXPLORATION, WHICH WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.

COMMERCIAL SATELLITE ENVIRONMENT

THE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE MARKET HAS STRENGTHENED SINCE THE DOWNTURN EARLIER IN THE DECADE AND IS EXPECTED TO STABILIZE WITH REPLACEMENT DEMAND THROUGH THE END OF THE

DECADE. THE MARKET REMAINS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE HOWEVER, WITH OVERCAPACITY ACROSS THE OVERALL INDUSTRY AND STRONG PRESSURE ON PRICING. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE PROFITABLE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE OPPORTUNITIES WHERE THE CUSTOMER VALUES OUR TECHNICAL

EXPERTISE AND UNIQUE SOLUTIONS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SINCE OUR OPERATING CYCLE IS LONG-TERM AND INVOLVES MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION CONTRACTS

WITH VARYING DELIVERY AND MILESTONE SCHEDULES, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR YEAR, OR YEAR-TO-YEAR COMPARISONS OF REVENUES AND EARNINGS, MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THE CUSTOMER AND THEIR

FUNDING SOURCES, OUR ORDERS MIGHT BE STRUCTURED AS ANNUAL FOLLOW-ON CONTRACTS, OR AS ONE LARGE MULTI-YEAR ORDER OR LONG-TERM AWARD. AS A RESULT, PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF BACKLOG ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE WORKLOADS. THE

FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS OF COMPARATIVE RESULTS AMONG PERIODS SHOULD BE VIEWED IN THIS CONTEXT.

REVENUES

IDS REVENUES INCREASED 4% IN 2006 AND 1% IN 2005 AS GROWTH IN BOTH PE&MS AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VOLUME IN N&SS.

OPERATING EARNINGS

IDS OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED BY $887 MILLION IN 2006 FROM 2005 REFLECTING A $569 MILLION NET GAIN ON THE

SALE OF ROCKETDYNE IN 2005 AND $770 MILLION OF CHARGES ON THE AEW&C DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IN 2006 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED MARGINS ON OTHER PROGRAMS. OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED BY $983 MILLION IN 2005 FROM 2004 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE NET GAIN

ON THE ROCKETDYNE SALE IN 2005 IN ADDITION TO STABLE PERFORMANCE IN THE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE BUSINESS COMPARED TO 2004, WHEN LOSSES WERE RECORDED RESULTING FROM COST GROWTH DUE TO TECHNICAL AND QUALITY ISSUES AND WRITE-DOWNS OF SLOW-MOVING

INVENTORY.

BACKLOG

TOTAL BACKLOG IS COMPRISED OF CONTRACTUAL

BACKLOG, WHICH REPRESENTS WORK WE ARE ON CONTRACT TO PERFORM FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING, AND UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG, WHICH REPRESENTS WORK WE ARE ON CONTRACT TO PERFORM FOR WHICH FUNDING HAS NOT YET BEEN AUTHORIZED AND APPROPRIATED. IDS TOTAL

BACKLOG DECREASED 6% IN 2006, FROM $80,513 MILLION TO $75,715 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES IN UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG OF $10,584 MILLION WHICH RESULTED FROM FUNDING RELEASED FROM NEW ORDERS AND EXISTING CONTRACTS ON F/A-18, FCS, C-17, AND

PROPRIETARY, OFFSET BY INCREASES IN CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG OF $5,786 MILLION WHICH WERE DRIVEN BY FUNDING RECEIVED FROM NEW ORDERS AND EXISTING CONTRACTS FOR C-17, F/A-18, INTEGRATED LOGISTICS CHINOOK SUPPORT, AND PROPRIETARY.

FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THE CHANGES BETWEEN PERIODS, REFER TO THE DISCUSSIONS OF THE

INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS BELOW.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

OUR BUSINESS INCLUDES A VARIETY OF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE COMPLEX DESIGN AND

TECHNICAL CHALLENGES. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE COST-TYPE CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENTS. IN THESE CASES THE ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL RISKS ARE PRIMARILY IN LOWER PROFIT RATES OR PROGRAM CANCELLATION IF MILESTONES AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS ARE NOT

ACCOMPLISHED. EXAMPLES OF THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE (GMD), FCS, P-8A (P-8A, FORMERLY MULTI-MISSION MARITIME AIRCRAFT), PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS, AIRBORNE LASER, JOINT TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEM (JTRS), FAMILY OF BEYOND

LINE-OF-SIGHT TERMINALS, AND THE E/A-18G.

SOME OF OUR DEVELOPMENT

PROGRAMS ARE CONTRACTED ON A FIXED-PRICE BASIS. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE HIGHLY COMPLEX DESIGNS. AS TECHNICAL OR QUALITY ISSUES ARISE, WE MAY EXPERIENCE SCHEDULE DELAYS AND COST IMPACTS, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR ESTIMATED COST TO PERFORM THE WORK

OR REDUCE OUR ESTIMATED PRICE, EITHER OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHARGE. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ONGOING, AND WHILE WE BELIEVE THE COST AND FEE ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE, THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF THESE

PROGRAMS CREATES FINANCIAL RISK AS ADDITIONAL COMPLETION COSTS MAY BECOME NECESSARY OR SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES COULD BE MISSED, WHICH COULD TRIGGER TERMINATION-FOR-DEFAULT PROVISIONS, THE LOSS OF SATELLITE ON-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS, OR OTHER

FINANCIALLY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE RISK FOR REACH-FORWARD LOSSES IF OUR ESTIMATED COSTS EXCEED OUR ESTIMATED CONTRACT REVENUES. EXAMPLES OF THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE AEW&C, 767 TANKER, COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY SATELLITES, VIGILARE

AND HIGH FREQUENCY MODERNISATION.

PE&MS

REVENUES INCREASED 6% IN 2006 AND 5% IN 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES AND OTHER VOLUME. THE REVENUE GROWTH OF $840 MILLION IN 2006 WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER DELIVERIES OF F-15 AND APACHE AND HIGHER VOLUME OF P-8A, F-22, AND

CHINOOK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED REVENUES OF AEW&C. THE REVENUE GROWTH OF $675 MILLION IN 2005 WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER DELIVERIES ON F-15 AND APACHE AND HIGHER VOLUME AND MILESTONE COMPLETIONS ON P-8A AND AEW&C, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FEWER

DELIVERIES ON F/A-18 AND LOWER VOLUME RESULTING FROM THE COMANCHE TERMINATION.

& DEVELOPMENT (CSR&D) EXPENDITURES ON THE 767 TANKER PROGRAM. OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED 3% IN 2005 DRIVEN BY EARNINGS FROM REVENUE GROWTH AND REDUCED CSR&D EXPENDITURES ON 767 TANKERS IN 2005 AND CHARGES RECORDED IN 2004 TO WRITE OFF

PRE-CONTRACT DEVELOPMENT COSTS ON THE 767 USAF TANKER PROGRAM.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE PE&MS SEGMENT CONTINUES TO FOCUS ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES WHERE IT CAN USE ITS CUSTOMER KNOWLEDGE, TECHNICAL STRENGTH AND LARGE-SCALE INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES TO PROVIDE TRANSFORMATIONAL

SOLUTIONS TO MEET THE WAR FIGHTERS ENDURING NEEDS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAS REMAINED CONSISTENT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES LEVERAGE OUR CAPABILITIES IN ARCHITECTURES, SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND

WEAPON SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE OUR CUSTOMERS CAPABILITIES IN THE AREAS OF SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND SURVIVABILITY. THESE EFFORTS FOCUS ON INCREASING MISSION EFFECTIVENESS AND INTEROPERABILITY,

AND IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY, RELIABILITY AND ECONOMIC OWNERSHIP. CONTINUED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS IN UNMANNED TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS HAVE ENABLED THE DEMONSTRATION OF MULTI-VEHICLE COORDINATED FLIGHT AND DISTRIBUTED CONTROL OF

HIGH-PERFORMANCE UNMANNED COMBAT AIR VEHICLES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN ADVANCED WEAPONS TECHNOLOGIES EMPHASIZES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PRECISION GUIDANCE AND MULTI-MODE TARGETING. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS IN THE GLOBAL TANKER TRANSPORT

AIRCRAFT PROGRAM REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT

OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE STATE-OF-THE-ART REFUELING CAPABILITIES TO DOMESTIC AND NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS. INVESTMENTS WERE ALSO MADE TO SUPPORT VARIOUS INTELLIGENCE,

SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING P-8A AND AEW&C AIRCRAFT. OTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS INCLUDE UPGRADE AND TECHNOLOGY INSERTIONS TO NETWORK-ENABLE AND ENHANCE THE CAPABILITY AND COMPETITIVENESS OF

CURRENT PRODUCT LINES SUCH AS THE F/A-18E/F SUPER HORNET, F-15E EAGLE, AH-64 APACHE, CH-47 CHINOOK AND C-17 GLOBEMASTER III.

BACKLOG

PE&MS TOTAL BACKLOG DECREASED 8% FROM 2005 TO 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO DELIVERIES AND SALES ON F/A-18 AND F-15 FROM MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS AWARDED IN

PRIOR YEARS. TOTAL BACKLOG DECREASED 13% FROM 2004 TO 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO DELIVERIES AND SALES ON C-17, F/A-18 AND P-8A, AND PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ADDITIONAL F-15 AND CHINOOK ORDERS.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

ITEMS WHICH COULD HAVE A FUTURE IMPACT ON PE&MS OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

AEW&C

DURING 2006 WE RECORDED CHARGES OF $770 MILLION ON OUR INTERNATIONAL AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING AND CONTROL PROGRAM. THIS

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, ALSO KNOWN AS WEDGETAIL IN AUSTRALIA AND PEACE EAGLE IN TURKEY, CONSISTS OF A 737-700 AIRCRAFT OUTFITTED WITH A VARIETY OF COMMAND AND CONTROL AND ADVANCED RADAR SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN INSTALLED ON AN AIRPLANE

BEFORE. WEDGETAIL INCLUDES SIX AIRCRAFT AND PEACE EAGLE INCLUDES FOUR AIRCRAFT. THIS IS AN ADVANCED AND COMPLEX FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM INVOLVING TECHNICAL CHALLENGES AT THE INDIVIDUAL SUBSYSTEM LEVEL AND IN THE OVERALL INTEGRATION OF THESE

SUBSYSTEMS INTO A RELIABLE AND EFFECTIVE OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY. THE SECOND-QUARTER CHARGE OF $496 MILLION INCLUDED ESTIMATED ADDITIONAL PROGRAM COSTS AND REDUCTIONS IN EXPECTED PRICING CAUSED BY TECHNICAL COMPLEXITIES WHICH RESULTED IN SCHEDULE

DELAYS AND COST GROWTH AND INCREASED THE RISK OF LATE DELIVERY PENALTIES. THE FINANCIAL IMPACT RECORDED IN THAT QUARTER RESULTED FROM A DETAILED ANALYSIS OF FLIGHT TEST DATA ALONG WITH A SERIES OF ADDITIONAL RIGOROUS TECHNICAL AND COST REVIEWS AFTER

FLIGHT TESTING RAMPED UP. THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT AND INTEGRATION HAD NOT PROGRESSED AS QUICKLY AS WE PLANNED, RESULTING IN THE DELIVERY FOR THE FIRST TWO AIRCRAFT BEING DELAYED 15 MONTHS. WE REORGANIZED THE PROGRAM TO IMPROVE SYSTEMS

ENGINEERING AND INTEGRATION AND WE STRENGTHENED THE LEADERSHIP TEAM IN BOTH PROGRAM MANAGEMENT AND ENGINEERING. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2006, AFTER A REVISED ESTIMATE OF TECHNICAL PROGRESS BY US AND OUR SUBCONTRACTORS, WE DETERMINED THAT PROGRAM

SUBSYSTEMS AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT HAD NOT MATURED AS WE HAD ANTICIPATED EARLIER IN THE YEAR. WE RECORDED A CHARGE OF AN ADDITIONAL $274 MILLION, REFLECTING FURTHER PROGRAM DELAYS OF UP TO SIX MONTHS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ONGOING, AND WHILE WE

BELIEVE THE MOST RECENT COST ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE, THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF THE PROGRAMS CREATES FINANCIAL RISK AS ADDITIONAL COMPLETION COSTS MAY BE NECESSARY OR SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES COULD BE

MISSED.

C-17

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAVE DELIVERED A

TOTAL OF 159 OF THE 190 C-17S ORDERED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE, WITH FINAL DELIVERIES SCHEDULED FOR 2009. DESPITE PENDING ORDERS, WHICH WOULD EXTEND DELIVERIES OF THE C-17 TO MID-2009, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL DECIDE IN 2007 TO

SUSPEND WORK ON LONG-LEAD ITEMS FROM SUPPLIERS AND/OR TO COMPLETE PRODUCTION OF THE C-17 IF FURTHER ORDERS ARE NOT RECEIVED. WE ARE STILL EVALUATING THE FULL FINANCIAL IMPACT OF A PRODUCTION SHUT-DOWN, INCLUDING ANY RECOVERY THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE

FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

767 TANKER PROGRAM

THE 767 TANKER PROGRAM

HAS ORDERS FOR EIGHT 767 TANKERS, FOUR FROM THE ITALIAN AIR FORCE AND FOUR FROM THE JAPAN SELF DEFENSE AGENCY. THE USAF IS CONTINUING TO PURSUE A REPLACEMENT FOR THE KC-135 TANKER AND HAS IDENTIFIED IT AS ITS TOP ACQUISITION PRIORITY FOR 2007. IN

ADDITION, THE PENTAGON REQUESTED FUNDING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT PHASE OF THE PROGRAM IN ITS 2008 BUDGET REQUEST IN FEBRUARY 2007. WE REMAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED TO THE USAF TANKER PROGRAM AND ARE READY TO SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMER IN WHATEVER DECISION IS MADE

REGARDING THE RECAPITALIZATION OF THE NATIONS CURRENT AERIAL REFUELING FLEET.

OPERATING EARNINGS

N&SS OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED $441 MILLION FROM 2005 TO 2006 AND INCREASED $822 MILLION FROM 2004 TO 2005 DRIVEN BY SIGNIFICANT ITEMS IN ALL THREE PERIODS. THE DECREASE FROM 2005 TO 2006 WAS DRIVEN BY THE $569 MILLION NET GAIN ON THE

ROCKETDYNE SALE AND HIGHER CONTRACT VALUES FOR DELTA IV LAUNCH CONTRACTS IN 2005, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED EARNINGS IN THE FCS PROGRAM IN 2006. THE INCREASE FROM 2004 TO 2005 WAS DRIVEN BY THE FAVORABLE ROCKETDYNE AND DELTA IV IMPACTS IN 2005

MENTIONED ABOVE, WHILE LOSSES WERE RECORDED IN OUR COMMERCIAL SATELLITE BUSINESS IN 2004 CAUSED BY PERFORMANCE ISSUES DUE TO COST GROWTH FROM TECHNICAL AND QUALITY ISSUES AND WRITE-OFFS OF SLOW-MOVING INVENTORY. N&SS OPERATING EARNINGS INCLUDE

EQUITY EARNINGS OF $71 MILLION, $72 MILLION, AND $70 MILLION FROM THE UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE JOINT VENTURE IN 2006, 2005, AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

DIVESTITURES

ON FEBRUARY 28, 2005, WE COMPLETED THE STOCK SALE OF EDD TO L-3 COMMUNICATIONS. ON AUGUST 2, 2005 WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR

ROCKETDYNE BUSINESS TO UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION. SEE NOTE 9 EXIT ACTIVITY AND DIVESTITURES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE N&SS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING REMAINS FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNICATIONS AND COMMAND AND CONTROL CAPABILITIES THAT SUPPORT A NETWORK-CENTRIC

ARCHITECTURE APPROACH FOR OUR VARIOUS GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS. WE ARE INVESTING IN THE COMMUNICATIONS MARKET TO ENABLE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN EXISTING AIR/GROUND PLATFORMS, INCREASE COMMUNICATIONS AVAILABILITY AND BANDWIDTH THROUGH MORE ROBUST SPACE

SYSTEMS, AND LEVERAGE INNOVATIVE COMMUNICATIONS CONCEPTS. KEY PROGRAMS IN THIS AREA INCLUDE JTRS, FCS, GPS, AND TRANSFORMATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. INVESTMENTS WERE ALSO MADE TO SUPPORT CONCEPTS THAT WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF

NEXT-GENERATION SPACE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS. ALONG WITH INCREASED FUNDING TO SUPPORT THESE AREAS OF ARCHITECTURE AND NETWORK-CENTRIC CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT, WE ALSO MAINTAINED OUR INVESTMENT LEVELS IN GLOBAL MISSILE DEFENSE AND ADVANCED MISSILE

DEFENSE CONCEPTS AND TECHNOLOGIES.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

ITEMS WHICH COULD HAVE A FUTURE IMPACT ON N&SS OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE

ON DECEMBER 1, 2006, WE COMPLETED THE TRANSACTION WITH LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION

(LOCKHEED) TO CREATE A 50/50 JOINT VENTURE NAMED UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE L.L.C. (ULA). ULA COMBINES THE PRODUCTION, ENGINEERING, TEST AND LAUNCH OPERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES OF BOEING DELTA AND LOCKHEED ATLAS ROCKETS. IN

CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION, WE CONTRIBUTED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OF $1,609 MILLION AND $695 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, TO ULA. THESE AMOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT PENDING FINAL REVIEW OF THE RESPECTIVE PARTIES CONTRIBUTIONS. ANY

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BOOK VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT AND OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ULAS NET ASSETS WOULD BE RECOGNIZED RATABLY IN FUTURE YEARS. WE ALSO ENTERED INTO AN INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH ULA THAT PROVIDES FOR THE PURCHASE BY ULA

FROM US OF BOEING DELTA INVENTORIES TOTALING $1,860 MILLION BY MARCH 31, 2021. WE AND LOCKHEED EACH WILL PROVIDE ULA WITH INITIAL CASH CONTRIBUTIONS OF UP TO $25 MILLION, AND WE EACH HAVE AGREED TO EXTEND A LINE OF CREDIT TO ULA OF UP TO $200

MILLION TO SUPPORT ITS WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE TRANSACTION, WE AND LOCKHEED TRANSFERRED PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS TO ULA AS OF THE CLOSING DATE. WE AND LOCKHEED AGREED TO JOINTLY

GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE CONTRACTS TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ULA THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2020 AGAINST POTENTIAL NON-RECOVERABILITY OF $1,375 MILLION OF BOEING DELTA INVENTORIES INCLUDED IN

CONTRIBUTED ASSETS PLUS $1,860 MILLION OF INVENTORY SUBJECT TO THE INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION, IN THE EVENT ULA IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN RE-PRICING OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS WHICH WE CONTRIBUTED TO ULA AND TO WHICH WE BELIEVE ULA IS ENTITLED, WE

WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SHORTFALL AND MAY RECORD UP TO $322 MILLION IN PRE-TAX LOSSES. ULA IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. N&SS 2006 REVENUES INCLUDE $727 MILLION RELATED TO DELTA ROCKETS AND FORMATION OF ULA WILL

REDUCE N&SS REVENUES IN 2007. WE DO NOT EXPECT ULA TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT TO OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS, OR FINANCIAL POSITION FOR 2007.

SEA LAUNCH

THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE, IN WHICH WE ARE A 40% PARTNER, PROVIDES OCEAN-BASED LAUNCH SERVICES TO COMMERCIAL SATELLITE CUSTOMERS. FOR THE YEAR

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

BCCS CUSTOMER FINANCING AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 TOTALED $8,034 MILLION, WHICH WAS SUBSTANTIALLY

COLLATERALIZED BY OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. WHILE WORLDWIDE TRAFFIC LEVELS ARE WELL ABOVE THOSE IN THE PAST, THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER FUEL PRICES CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. AT THE SAME TIME, THE CREDIT RATINGS OF SOME AIRLINES,

PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES, HAVE REMAINED AT LOW LEVELS. DESPITE POSITIVE FACTORS INCLUDING PASSENGER LOAD AT RECORD HIGH LEVELS, A LIMITED SUPPLY OF ECONOMICALLY VIABLE USED AIRCRAFT AND, INCREASING LEASE RATES, VALUES AS MEASURED BY

REFERENCE TO PUBLISHED REPORTS FROM MULTIPLE EXTERNAL APPRAISERS FOR THE VARIOUS AIRCRAFT TYPES THAT ARE COLLATERAL IN BCCS PORTFOLIO GENERALLY HAVE NOT INCREASED.

AIRCRAFT VALUES AND LEASE RATES ARE IMPACTED BY THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF AIRCRAFT THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUT OF SERVICE. APPROXIMATELY 1,850

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT (9.9% OF CURRENT WORLD FLEET) CONTINUE TO BE PARKED, INCLUDING BOTH IN PRODUCTION AND OUT-OF-PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT TYPES OF WHICH OVER 50% ARE NOT EXPECTED TO RETURN TO SERVICE. AIRCRAFT VALUATIONS COULD DECLINE IF SIGNIFICANT

NUMBERS OF AIRCRAFT, PARTICULARLY TYPES WITH RELATIVELY FEW OPERATORS, ARE PLACED OUT OF SERVICE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, $2,590 MILLION AND $1,171 MILLION OF BCCS PORTFOLIO WAS COLLATERALIZED BY 717 AND 757 AIRCRAFT. DURING 2006, BCC RECOGNIZED AN EXPENSE OF $15 MILLION TO INCREASE THE

VALUATION ALLOWANCE RESULTING FROM A DECREASE IN THE COLLATERAL VALUE OF THE 717 AIRCRAFT. SEE NOTE 10.

HIGHER GAIN ON THE SALE OF AIRCRAFT AND CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN NOTES RECEIVABLE OF $23 MILLION. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN INTEREST AND LEASE INCOME DUE TO DECREASES IN THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE BALANCE OF THE RELATED

PORTFOLIO. BCCS REVENUES WERE ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED IN 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004.

OPERATING EARNINGS

BCCS OPERATING EARNINGS ARE

PRESENTED NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE, PROVISION FOR LOSSES, ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION ON LEASED EQUIPMENT AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED BY $59 MILLION IN 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED REVENUES. THE INCREASE

IN OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2005 COMPARED WITH 2004 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A LOWER ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE AND THE ABSENCE OF DEBT REDEMPTION COSTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.

BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVED THE RESTRUCTURED TERMS OF CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO THE NOTES RECEIVABLE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, NORTHWEST IS CURRENT ON PAYMENTS RELATING TO THE NOTES RECEIVABLE HELD BY BCC. WE DO NOT EXPECT THE NORTHWEST

BANKRUPTCY, INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF ANY RESTRUCTURINGS, TO HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FUTURE EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN ADDITION TO THE CUSTOMERS DISCUSSED ABOVE, CERTAIN OTHER CUSTOMERS HAVE REQUESTED A RESTRUCTURING OF THEIR TRANSACTIONS WITH BCC. BCC HAS NOT REACHED AGREEMENT

ON ANY RESTRUCTURING REQUESTS THAT IT BELIEVES WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $499 MILLION TO $7,499 MILLION IN 2006. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET EARNINGS. THE WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS IN 2006

COMPARED WITH 2005 REFLECT $1,340 MILLION OF LOWER PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2006. WORKING CAPITAL REDUCTIONS IN 2006 ALSO REFLECT HIGHER ADVANCES DRIVEN BY COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE ORDERS, DECREASED INVESTMENT IN CUSTOMER FINANCING, AND LOW INCOME TAX

PAYMENTS WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITY.

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED TO $7,000 MILLION IN 2005 FROM $3,504 MILLION IN 2004 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS, DECREASED INVESTMENT IN CUSTOMER FINANCING, AND HIGHER ADVANCES AND

BILLINGS IN EXCESS OF RELATED COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED INVESTMENT IN INVENTORIES.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED TO $3,186 MILLION IN 2006 FROM $98 MILLION IN 2005. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR INVESTMENT OF $1,738 MILLION IN THE 2006 ACQUISITION OF AVIALL,

INC. (AVIALL), NET OF $42 MILLION OF CASH ACQUIRED, AND $458 MILLION OF ASSUMED DEBT, IN AN ALL-CASH MERGER. THE ASSUMED DEBT WAS SUBSEQUENTLY REPAID ON THE ACQUISITION CLOSING DATE. IN 2005, WE RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $1,676 MILLION, PRIMARILY FROM

THE DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

36

OPERATIONS IN WICHITA, KANSAS AND TULSA AND MCALESTER, OKLAHOMA, AND THE SALE OF ROCKETDYNE. IN 2004, WE RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $2,017 MILLION FROM THE SALE OF

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS RELATED TO BCCS COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS.

DURING 2004, WE INVESTED $3,000 MILLION OF CASH IN AN EXTERNALLY MANAGED PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED INCOME INSTRUMENTS. THE PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND HIGHLY LIQUID AND PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF INVESTMENT FIXED INCOME

INSTRUMENTS (U.S. DOLLAR DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES TREASURY, OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, CORPORATIONS, MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES). AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, OUR EXTERNALLY MANAGED PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED

INCOME INSTRUMENTS HAD AN AVERAGE DURATION OF 1.6 YEARS. THE INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED TO $3,645 MILLION IN 2006 FROM $4,657 MILLION IN 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES. CASH USED BY FINANCING

ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $1,170 MILLION IN 2005 FROM $3,487 MILLION IN 2004 PRIMARILY DUE TO A $2,125 MILLION INCREASE IN COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER DEBT REPAYMENTS.

DURING 2006, WE REPURCHASED 21,184,202 SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $80.18 IN OUR OPEN

MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, 3,749,377 SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $80.28 AS PART OF THE SHAREVALUE TRUST DISTRIBUTION, AND 49,288 SHARES IN STOCK SWAPS. DURING 2005 AND 2004, 45,217,300 SHARES AND 14,708,856 SHARES WERE REPURCHASED AT AN

AVERAGE PRICE OF $63.60 AND $51.09 IN OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AND 33,660 SHARES AND 50,657 SHARES WERE REPURCHASED IN STOCK SWAPS.

IN 2006, WE REPAID $1,681 MILLION OF DEBT, INCLUDING $713 MILLION OF DEBT HELD AT BCC AND $458 MILLION OF DEBT ASSUMED IN THE AVIALL ACQUISITION. IN 2005 AND 2004,

WE REPAID $1,378 MILLION AND $2,208 MILLION OF DEBT. REPAYMENTS IN 2004 INCLUDED BCCS REDEMPTION OF $1,000 MILLION FACE VALUE OF ITS OUTSTANDING SENIOR NOTES, WHICH HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF $999 MILLION. BCC RECOGNIZED A NET LOSS OF $42 MILLION

RELATED TO THIS EARLY DEBT REDEMPTION.

THAT A BALANCED CAPITAL ALLOCATION WILL CONTINUE TO BE PURSUED.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

WE AND BCC HAVE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT CONTINUE TO SERVE AS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL SOURCES OF SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY. THROUGHOUT 2006 AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, NEITHER WE NOR BCC HAD ANY COMMERCIAL PAPER

BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING.

WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING

CAPACITY. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE $3,000 MILLION ($1,500 MILLION EXCLUSIVELY AVAILABLE FOR BCC) OF UNUSED BORROWING ON REVOLVING CREDIT LINE AGREEMENTS. IN 2006, WE ROLLED OVER THE 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, REDUCING IT FROM $1,500 MILLION TO

$1,000 MILLION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CURRENTLY, THERE IS $500 MILLION ALLOCATED TO BCC. WE ALSO ROLLED OVER THE 5-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY, INCREASING IT FROM $1,500 MILLION TO $2,000 MILLION, OF WHICH $1,000

MILLION IS ALLOCATED TO BCC. WE HAVE $1,000 MILLION THAT REMAINS AVAILABLE FROM A SHELF REGISTRATION FILED WITH THE SEC ON MARCH 23, 2004, AND BCC HAS AN ADDITIONAL $3,421 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE, WHICH IS DUE TO EXPIRE IN NOVEMBER 2008.

WE BELIEVE OUR INTERNALLY GENERATED LIQUIDITY, TOGETHER WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL CAPITAL RESOURCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY EXISTING COMMITMENTS AND PLANS, AND ALSO TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF POTENTIAL

STRATEGIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD THEY ARISE WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR.

WE AND LOCKHEED HAVE AGREED TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO ULA A LINE OF CREDIT IN THE AMOUNT OF UP TO $200 MILLION EACH AS MAY BE NECESSARY FROM TIME TO TIME TO SUPPORT ULAS EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE BUSINESS DURING THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD

FOLLOWING DECEMBER 1, 2006. ULA DID NOT REQUEST ANY FUNDS UNDER THE LINE OF CREDIT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS  AN AMENDMENT

OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R)

(SFAS NO. 158), WHICH REQUIRED RECOGNITION OF THE FUNDED STATUS OF DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS, WITH A CORRESPONDING AFTER-TAX ADJUSTMENT TO ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE LOSS. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 158, TOGETHER WITH THE ANNUAL REMEASUREMENT OF OUR PENSION PLANS, RESULTED IN A NET $6,509 MILLION DECREASE IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THIS DECREASE DOES NOT AFFECT CASH FLOWS OR THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR

BENEFIT PLANS. THE COVENANTS FOR OUR DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES WERE AMENDED TO EXCLUDE THE IMPACTS OF SFAS NO. 158.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS FOR OUR DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES

THAT ARE LEGALLY BINDING; SPECIFY A FIXED, MINIMUM OR RANGE OF QUANTITIES; SPECIFY A FIXED, MINIMUM, VARIABLE, OR INDEXED PRICE PROVISION; AND SPECIFY APPROXIMATE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION, THE AGREEMENTS ARE NOT CANCELABLE WITHOUT

SUBSTANTIAL PENALTY. PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE AMOUNTS RECORDED AS WELL AS AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. APPROXIMATELY 16% OF THE PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS DISCLOSED ABOVE ARE REIMBURSABLE TO US PURSUANT TO

COST-TYPE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

PRODUCTION RELATED PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION INCLUDE AGREEMENTS FOR PRODUCTION GOODS, TOOLING COSTS, ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS CONTRACTS, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS PRODUCTION RELATED

OBLIGATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATION RELATES TO INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS THAT SPECIFY DETERMINABLE PRICES AND QUANTITIES, AND LONG-TERM DELIVERY TIMEFRAMES. IN

ADDITION, WE PURCHASE RAW MATERIALS ON BEHALF OF OUR SUPPLIERS. THESE AGREEMENTS REQUIRE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO BE PREPARED TO BUILD AND DELIVER ITEMS IN SUFFICIENT TIME TO MEET OUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULES. THE NEED FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS WITH

SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS ARISES FROM THE EXTENDED PRODUCTION PLANNING HORIZON FOR MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE INVENTORY COMMITMENTS IS SUPPORTED BY FIRM CONTRACTS AND/OR HAS HISTORICALLY RESULTED IN SETTLEMENT THROUGH

REIMBURSEMENT FROM CUSTOMERS FOR PENALTY PAYMENTS TO THE SUPPLIER SHOULD THE CUSTOMER NOT TAKE DELIVERY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN OUR FORECASTS OF COSTS FOR PROGRAM AND CONTRACT ACCOUNTING. SOME INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS MAY INCLUDE

ESCALATION ADJUSTMENTS. IN THESE LIMITED CASES, WE HAVE INCLUDED OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECT OF THE ESCALATION ADJUSTMENT IN THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS

OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. TO FACILITATE ECONOMIC FLOW BACK AND/OR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO THEIR BUSINESSES OR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AS THE RESULT OF THEIR PROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND/OR SERVICES FROM US. THESE COMMITMENTS MAY BE SATISFIED BY OUR PLACEMENT OF

DIRECT WORK OR VENDOR ORDERS FOR SUPPLIES, OPPORTUNITIES TO BID ON SUPPLY CONTRACTS, TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER FORMS OF ASSISTANCE. HOWEVER, IN CERTAIN CASES, OUR COMMITMENTS MAY BE SATISFIED THROUGH OTHER PARTIES (SUCH AS OUR VENDORS) WHO

PURCHASE SUPPLIES FROM OUR NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS. WE DO NOT COMMIT TO INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS UNLESS A CONTRACT FOR SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IS SIGNED. IN CERTAIN CASES, PENALTIES COULD BE IMPOSED IF WE DO NOT MEET OUR INDUSTRIAL

PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS. DURING 2006, WE INCURRED NO SUCH PENALTIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE HAVE OUTSTANDING INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS TOTALING $7.7 BILLION THAT EXTEND THROUGH 2019. PURCHASE ORDER COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH

INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH A PURCHASE ORDER COMMITMENT FROM US, A COUNTRY OUTSIDE THE U.S. OR CUSTOMER MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPABILITY TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS AND MUST BE COMPETITIVE

IN COST, QUALITY AND SCHEDULE.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS RECORDED ON

THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION PRIMARILY INCLUDE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND CERTAIN OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDING ACCRUED COMPENSATION AND DIVIDENDS PAYABLE.

ESTIMATED EARLIEST FUNDING DATES. BASED ON HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, IT IS NOT ANTICIPATED THAT ALL OF THESE COMMITMENTS WILL BE EXERCISED BY OUR CUSTOMERS (SEE NOTE 19).

INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS

WE UTILIZE INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS (IRB) ISSUED BY THE CITY OF WICHITA, KANSAS AND FULTON COUNTY,

GEORGIA TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE AND/OR CONSTRUCTION OF REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY (SEE NOTE 19).

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING INVOLVES A

JUDGMENTAL PROCESS OF ESTIMATING THE TOTAL SALES AND COSTS FOR EACH CONTRACT, WHICH RESULTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES. FOR EACH CONTRACT, THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED

COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED.

DUE TO THE

SIZE, LENGTH OF TIME AND NATURE OF MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS, THE ESTIMATION OF TOTAL SALES AND COSTS THROUGH COMPLETION IS COMPLICATED AND SUBJECT TO MANY VARIABLES. TOTAL CONTRACT SALES ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON NEGOTIATED CONTRACT PRICES AND QUANTITIES,

MODIFIED BY OUR ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CONTRACT OPTIONS, CHANGE ORDERS, INCENTIVE AND AWARD PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE, AND PRICE ADJUSTMENT CLAUSES (SUCH AS INFLATION OR INDEX-BASED CLAUSES). THE MAJORITY OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE

WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. GENERALLY THE PRICE IS BASED ON ESTIMATED COST TO PRODUCE THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE PLUS PROFIT. THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE TYPES OF COST THAT WILL BE REIMBURSED IN ESTABLISHING CONTRACT PRICE.

TOTAL CONTRACT COST ESTIMATES ARE LARGELY BASED ON NEGOTIATED OR ESTIMATED PURCHASE CONTRACT TERMS, HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS BASE AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE INFLATIONARY TRENDS,

TECHNICAL AND SCHEDULE RISK, INTERNAL AND SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS VOLUME ASSUMPTIONS, ASSET UTILIZATION, AND ANTICIPATED LABOR AGREEMENTS.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES INVOLVES PROCEDURES AND PERSONNEL IN ALL AREAS THAT PROVIDE FINANCIAL OR PRODUCTION INFORMATION ON THE STATUS OF

CONTRACTS. ESTIMATES OF EACH SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS SALES AND COSTS ARE REVIEWED AND REASSESSED QUARTERLY. ANY CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES RESULT IN RECOGNITION OF CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CONTRACT PROFIT IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH CHANGES ARE

MADE.

DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JUDGMENT IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS

DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS LIKELY THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT COST OF SALES AMOUNTS COULD BE RECORDED IF WE USED DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS, OR IF THE

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS/ESTIMATES, SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE, OR CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ADVERSELY OR POSITIVELY AFFECT

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN FUTURE PERIODS. IF THE COMBINED GROSS MARGIN FOR ALL CONTRACTS IN IDS FOR ALL OF 2006 HAD BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE HIGHER OR LOWER BY 1.0%, IT WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED INCOME FOR THE YEAR BY APPROXIMATELY $324 MILLION.

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES THE DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE RELATIONSHIP OF SALES TO COSTS FOR THE DEFINED PROGRAM

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. FOR EACH PROGRAM, THE

AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE FOR THE TOTAL REMAINING PROGRAM TO THE AMOUNT OF SALES RECOGNIZED FOR AIRPLANES DELIVERED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER.

FACTORS THAT MUST BE ESTIMATED INCLUDE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, SALES PRICE, LABOR

AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS, MATERIAL COSTS, PROCURED PARTS, MAJOR COMPONENT COSTS, OVERHEAD COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS, AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS. UNDERLYING ALL ESTIMATES USED FOR PROGRAM ACCOUNTING IS THE FORECASTED MARKET AND CORRESPONDING

PRODUCTION RATES. ESTIMATION OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH PROGRAM TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SEVERAL FACTORS THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF THE DEMAND FOR THE PARTICULAR PROGRAM, SUCH AS FIRM ORDERS, LETTERS OF INTENT FROM PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS, AND MARKET

STUDIES. TOTAL ESTIMATED PROGRAM SALES ARE DETERMINED BY ESTIMATING THE MODEL MIX AND SALES PRICE FOR ALL UNSOLD UNITS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, ADDED TOGETHER WITH THE SALES FOR ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS UNDER CONTRACT. THE SALES PRICES FOR ALL

UNDELIVERED UNITS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY INCLUDE AN ESCALATION ADJUSTMENT THAT IS BASED ON PROJECTED ESCALATION RATES, CONSISTENT WITH TYPICAL SALES CONTRACT TERMS. COST ESTIMATES ARE BASED LARGELY ON NEGOTIATED AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS

WITH SUPPLIERS, HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS, AND BUSINESS BASE AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE PRODUCTION RATES, INTERNAL AND SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, ASSET UTILIZATION, ANTICIPATED LABOR

AGREEMENTS, AND INFLATIONARY TRENDS.

TO ENSURE RELIABILITY IN OUR

ESTIMATES, WE EMPLOY A RIGOROUS ESTIMATING PROCESS THAT IS REVIEWED AND UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE RECOGNIZED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS.

DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JUDGMENT IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS LIKELY THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT COST OF SALES

AMOUNTS COULD BE RECORDED IF WE USED DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS, OR IF THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS/ESTIMATES, OR CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ADVERSELY OR POSITIVELY AFFECT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

IF COMBINED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES FOR ALL COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE

PROGRAMS FOR ALL OF 2006 HAD BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE HIGHER OR LOWER BY 1%, IT WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED PRE-TAX INCOME FOR 2006 BY APPROXIMATELY $243 MILLION.

AIRCRAFT VALUATION

USED AIRCRAFT UNDER TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS

THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT IS DETERMINED USING AIRCRAFT SPECIFIC DATA SUCH AS, MODEL, AGE AND CONDITION,

MARKET CONDITIONS FOR SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT AND SIMILAR MODELS, AND MULTIPLE VALUATION SOURCES. TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT VALUATION VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON WHICH MARKET WE DETERMINE IS MOST LIKELY FOR EACH AIRCRAFT. THIS PROCESS BEGINS YEARS BEFORE

THE RETURN OF THE AIRCRAFT. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE UPDATE OUR VALUATION ANALYSIS BASED ON THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH PLACING EACH AIRCRAFT INTO A MARKET.

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BASED ON THE BEST MARKET INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO PERFORM ON

TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WITH NET AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO CUSTOMERS TOTALING $19 MILLION AND $72 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDED $22 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, WHICH REPRESENTS THE EXPOSURE

RELATED TO THESE TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS.

HAD THE ESTIMATE OF TRADE-IN

VALUE USED TO CALCULATE OUR OBLIGATION RELATED TO PROBABLE TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS BEEN 10% LOWER THAN OUR ACTUAL ASSESSMENT, USING A MEASUREMENT DATE OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY

APPROXIMATELY $2 MILLION. WE CONTINUALLY UPDATE OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR ALL THESE COMMITMENTS FOR ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS.

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE, WE EVALUATE ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR HELD FOR RE-LEASE FOR IMPAIRMENT UTILIZING AN EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. WE USE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS WHEN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW INCLUDING OUR INTENTION TO HOLD OR DISPOSE OF AN ASSET BEFORE THE END OF ITS ECONOMIC USEFUL LIFE, THE EXPECTED FUTURE LEASE RATES, LEASE TERMS, RESIDUAL VALUE OF THE AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT, PERIODS IN WHICH THE ASSET MAY BE HELD IN

PREPARATION FOR A FOLLOW-ON LEASE, MAINTENANCE COSTS, REMARKETING COSTS AND THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSET.

WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE RECORDED IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE FAIR VALUE

OF THE ASSET.

HAD FUTURE LEASE RATES ON THESE ASSETS WE EVALUATE FOR

IMPAIRMENT BEEN 10% LOWER, WE ESTIMATE THAT NO ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE WOULD HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF ANY FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.

USED AIRCRAFT ACQUIRED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORIES

AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET AS IT IS OUR INTENT TO SELL THESE ASSETS. TO MITIGATE COSTS AND ENHANCE MARKETABILITY, AIRCRAFT MAY BE PLACED ON OPERATING LEASE. WHILE ON OPERATING LEASE, THE ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER FINANCING,

HOWEVER, THE VALUATION CONTINUES TO BE BASED ON THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES (VALUATION PROVISION) IS USED TO PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF RECEIVABLES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE BALANCE

REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND PROBABLE BUT UNCONFIRMED LOSSES IN THE RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO. THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON VARIOUS QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, COLLATERAL VALUES, AND

RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL CREDIT REVIEWS. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING COLLECTIBILITY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, A CUSTOMERS EXTENDED DELINQUENCY, REQUESTS FOR RESTRUCTURING AND FILINGS FOR BANKRUPTCY. THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE IS

ASSESSED QUARTERLY. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ACTUAL RESULTS WILL NOT DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES OR THAT THE CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTORS IN THE FUTURE WILL NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES.

HAD THE APPLICABLE CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATE BEEN CHANGED BY PLUS OR MINUS

15%, EXCLUDING IMPAIRED CUSTOMERS FOR WHICH THE DEFAULT RATE IS MAINTAINED AT 100%, WE ESTIMATE THAT THE ALLOWANCE WOULD HAVE BEEN HIGHER OR LOWER BY APPROXIMATELY $34 MILLION.

LEASE RESIDUAL VALUES

EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES IS CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND IS

DEPRECIATED TO ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE LEASE TERM OR PROJECTED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSET. ESTIMATES USED IN DETERMINING RESIDUAL VALUES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE FOR

EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES. FOR EXAMPLE, A CHANGE IN THE ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES OF 1% AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 COULD RESULT IN A CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX EARNINGS IMPACT OF $20 MILLION TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER TIME.

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, AND WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SUCH THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. OUR ANNUAL TESTING DATE IS APRIL 1. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY FIRST COMPARING THE BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED

OPERATIONS. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN BOOK VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. IN THIS PROCESS, A FAIR VALUE FOR GOODWILL IS ESTIMATED, BASED IN PART ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPERATIONS,

AND IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE SHORTFALL OF THE FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.

WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. FORECASTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE SALES AND

OPERATING COSTS, BASED PRIMARILY ON EXISTING FIRM ORDERS, EXPECTED FUTURE ORDERS, CONTRACTS WITH SUPPLIERS, LABOR AGREEMENTS, AND GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN THESE FORECASTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT RECORDED, IF

ANY.

THE CASH FLOW FORECASTS ARE ADJUSTED BY AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT

RATE DERIVED FROM OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION PLUS A SUITABLE CONTROL PREMIUM AT THE DATE OF EVALUATION. THEREFORE, CHANGES IN THE STOCK PRICE MAY ALSO AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT RECORDED. AT THE DATE OF OUR PREVIOUS IMPAIRMENT TEST, A 10%

INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WOULD HAVE HAD NO IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

WE HAVE DEFINED

BENEFIT PENSION PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OUR EMPLOYEES. WE ALSO HAVE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTHCARE COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS. ACCOUNTING RULES REQUIRE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF OUR

PROJECTED OBLIGATIONS AND PLAN ASSETS. THESE MEASUREMENTS REQUIRE SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN, AND MEDICAL TREND RATE (RATE OF GROWTH FOR MEDICAL COSTS).

CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FUTURE ANNUAL EXPENSE. IN ADDITION, AS RESULT OF OUR ADOPTION OF SFAS 158, CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (NET OF TAXES) AT FUTURE

MEASUREMENT DATES.

WE USE A DISCOUNT RATE THAT IS BASED ON A

POINT-IN-TIME ESTIMATE AS OF OUR SEPTEMBER 30 ANNUAL MEASUREMENT DATE. CHANGES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE OUR RECORDED LIABILITIES WITH A CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENT TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN

FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS, THE ADJUSTMENT FOR A CHANGE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT OCCURS. IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, WE SHOW THE SENSITIVITY OF OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLAN LIABILITIES AND NET PERIODIC COST TO A 25 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE.

PENSION EXPENSE IS ALSO SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN. AN INCREASE OR

DECREASE OF 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED 2006 PENSION INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $108 MILLION. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ACTUAL RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE EXPECTED LONG TERM RATE OF

RETURN ARE REFLECTED IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (NET OF TAXES) AS OF OUR ANNUAL MEASUREMENT DATE. IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ACTUAL RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND THE EXPECTED LONG TERM RATE OF RETURN WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH IT OCCURS.

THE ASSUMED

MEDICAL TREND RATES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT AFFECT ON THE FOLLOWING YEARS EXPENSE RECORDED LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, WE SHOW THE SENSITIVITY OF OUR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN LIABILITIES AND NET

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO MATTERS COVERED BY OUR INSURANCE. MAJOR CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 22, INCLUDING OUR CONTESTING THE DEFAULT TERMINATION OF THE A-12 AIRCRAFT, EMPLOYMENT AND BENEFITS LITIGATION BROUGHT BY SEVERAL

OF OUR EMPLOYEES, AND LITIGATION/ARBITRATION INVOLVING BSSI.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE RISK

WE HAVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK, PRINCIPALLY INVESTMENTS, FIXED-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, AND CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED MATERIAL GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE INSTRUMENTS DUE TO

INTEREST RATE CHANGES. ADDITIONALLY, BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION (BCC) USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF BCCS MARKET RISK RELATES TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES. THIS RISK IS MANAGED BY MATCHING THE PROFILE OF

BCCS LIABILITIES WITH THE PROFILE OF ASSETS. ANY EXPOSURE TO MISMATCH RISK IS MEASURED AND MANAGED WITH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES. WE DO NOT USE INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES FOR SPECULATIVE OR TRADING PURPOSES. ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE

ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND DERIVATIVES AFFECTED BY A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES ARE NOT TRADED, IF WE HAD AN IMMEDIATE, ONE-TIME, 100 BASIS-POINT INCREASE IN MARKET RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE ESTIMATED THAT THE TAX-ADJUSTED NET FAIR VALUE OF

THESE ITEMS WOULD HAVE DECREASED BY $9 MILLION COMPARED TO A DECREASE OF $15 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2005.

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BASED ON THE PORTFOLIO OF OTHER BOEING EXISTING DEBT, THE UNHEDGED EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IS NOT MATERIAL.

THE INVESTORS IN THE FIXED-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT WE ISSUE DO NOT GENERALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEMAND WE PAY OFF THESE OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO MATURITY. THEREFORE, EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IS NOT BELIEVED TO BE MATERIAL FOR OUR FIXED-RATE

DEBT.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK RELATING TO RECEIPTS FROM

CUSTOMERS AND PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FIRMLY COMMITTED AND FORECASTED FOREIGN DENOMINATED PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS RELATED TO OUR ONGOING

BUSINESS. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, A 10% UNFAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENT IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS WOULD HAVE REDUCED OUR UNREALIZED

GAINS BY $69 MILLION. CONSISTENT WITH THE USE OF THESE CONTRACTS TO NEUTRALIZE THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, SUCH UNREALIZED LOSSES OR GAINS WOULD BE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING GAINS OR LOSSES, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE REMEASUREMENT OF THE

UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED. WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE FORWARD CURRENCY CONTRACTS AND THE OFFSETTING UNDERLYING COMMITMENTS DO NOT CREATE MATERIAL MARKET RISK.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005, 2004

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF ALL MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE CONSOLIDATED.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA

REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES FOR WHICH CHANGES IN THE NEAR TERM ARE CONSIDERED REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY HAVE A

MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DISCLOSED IN THESE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OPERATING CYCLE

FOR CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WE USE THE DURATION OF THE RELATED CONTRACT OR PROGRAM AS OUR OPERATING CYCLE, WHICH IS GENERALLY LONGER THAN ONE YEAR AND COULD EXCEED 3 YEARS.

REVENUE AND RELATED COST RECOGNITION

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING IS USED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION

ACTIVITIES PREDOMINATELY BY THE THREE SEGMENTS WITHIN INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS (IDS). THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS: MILITARY AIRCRAFT, HELICOPTERS, MISSILES, SPACE SYSTEMS, MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS, SATELLITES, AND

INFORMATION AND BATTLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. THE MAJORITY OF BUSINESS CONDUCTED IN THE IDS SEGMENTS IS PERFORMED UNDER CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS THAT EXTEND OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. CONTRACT ACCOUNTING INVOLVES A

JUDGMENTAL PROCESS OF ESTIMATING THE TOTAL SALES AND COSTS FOR EACH CONTRACT RESULTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES. FOR EACH CONTRACT, THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF

SALES PERCENTAGE TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED.

WE COMBINE

CONTRACTS FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES WHEN THEY ARE NEGOTIATED AS A PACKAGE WITH AN OVERALL PROFIT MARGIN OBJECTIVE; THEY ESSENTIALLY REPRESENT AN AGREEMENT TO DO A SINGLE PROJECT FOR A SINGLE CUSTOMER; THEY INVOLVE INTERRELATED CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES

WITH SUBSTANTIAL COMMON COSTS; AND THEY ARE PERFORMED CONCURRENTLY OR SEQUENTIALLY. WHEN A GROUP OF CONTRACTS IS COMBINED, REVENUE AND PROFIT ARE EARNED UNIFORMLY OVER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBINED CONTRACTS.

SALES RELATED TO CONTRACTS WITH FIXED PRICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS DELIVERIES ARE MADE,

EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD BEFORE DELIVERIES BEGIN, FOR WHICH SALES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE MILESTONES. SALES RELATED TO CONTRACTS IN WHICH WE ARE

REIMBURSED FOR COSTS INCURRED PLUS AN AGREED UPON PROFIT ARE RECORDED AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE TYPES OF COST THAT WILL BE REIMBURSED IN ESTABLISHING CONTRACT PRICE. CONTRACTS MAY CONTAIN

PROVISIONS TO EARN INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES IF TARGETS ARE ACHIEVED. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED ARE RECORDED OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD OF THE CONTRACT. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED ARE

RECORDED WHEN AWARDED.

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

OUR COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANES SEGMENT PREDOMINATELY USES PROGRAM ACCOUNTING TO ACCOUNT FOR SALES AND COST OF SALES RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAMS. PROGRAM ACCOUNTING IS A

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

METHOD OF ACCOUNTING APPLICABLE TO PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED FOR DELIVERY UNDER PRODUCTION-TYPE CONTRACTS WHERE PROFITABILITY IS REALIZED OVER MULTIPLE CONTRACTS AND

YEARS. UNDER PROGRAM ACCOUNTING, INVENTORIABLE PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED AND CHARGED TO COST OF SALES BY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF BY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR CONTRACTS. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE

ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP OF SALES TO COST OF SALES, PROGRAM

ACCOUNTING REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF (A) THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN A PROGRAM, (B) THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE UNITS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED, AND (C) THE UNITS EXPECTED SALES PRICES, PRODUCTION

COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING, AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM.

WE RECOGNIZE REVENUE ON SALES OF COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES BASED ON THE GROSS AMOUNT BILLED TO CUSTOMERS. WE RECOGNIZE SALES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DELIVERIES AS EACH UNIT IS COMPLETED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. SALES RECOGNIZED REPRESENT

THE PRICE NEGOTIATED WITH THE CUSTOMER, ADJUSTED BY AN ESCALATION FORMULA. THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE FOR THE TOTAL REMAINING PROGRAM TO THE AMOUNT OF SALES RECOGNIZED FOR

AIRPLANES DELIVERED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER.

CONCESSION SHARING

ARRANGEMENTS

WE ACCOUNT FOR SALES CONCESSIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN CONSIDERATION OF THEIR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE (SALES CONCESSIONS) WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DELIVERED. THE SALES CONCESSIONS

INCURRED ARE PARTIALLY REIMBURSED BY A SUPPLIER IN ACCORDANCE WITH A CONCESSION SHARING ARRANGEMENT. PRIOR TO ADOPTION OF EITF ISSUE NO. 02-16,

ACCOUNTING BY A CUSTOMER (INCLUDING A RESELLER) FOR CERTAIN CONSIDERATION RECEIVED FROM A VENDOR

(EITF 02-16), WE RECOGNIZED CONCESSIONS RECEIVED FROM VENDORS AS REVENUE. UPON ADOPTION OF EITF 02-16 ON JANUARY 1, 2003, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TRANSITION PROVISIONS OF THE CONSENSUS, WE RECOGNIZED CONCESSIONS RECEIVED FROM VENDORS FOR NEW

ARRANGEMENTS, INCLUDING MODIFICATIONS OF EXISTING ARRANGEMENTS, AS A REDUCTION IN COST OF PRODUCTS. WE CONTINUED TO APPLY OUR PREVIOUS ACCOUNTING POLICY TO ARRANGEMENTS ENTERED INTO PRIOR TO DECEMBER 31, 2002 THAT WERE NOT MODIFIED; SUCH

ARRANGEMENTS WERE GRANDFATHERED UNDER EITF 02-16 AND, ACCORDINGLY, WE CONTINUED TO RECOGNIZE CONCESSIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ARRANGEMENTS AS REVENUE.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, WE CHANGED HOW WE ACCOUNT FOR CONCESSIONS RECEIVED FROM VENDORS THAT WERE GRANDFATHERED UNDER EITF 02-16. FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004, THIS CHANGE DECREASED CONSOLIDATED AND COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT SALES OF PRODUCTS AND COST OF PRODUCTS BY $1,224 AND $1,057 AS FOLLOWS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE BELIEVE THE NEWLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING METHOD IS PREFERABLE BECAUSE IT ALIGNS OUR ACCOUNTING FOR ALL CONCESSION

ARRANGEMENTS WITH VENDORS WITH GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY EITF 02-16. IN ACCORDANCE WITH EITF 02-16, REIMBURSEMENTS RECEIVED BY A CUSTOMER FROM A VENDOR ARE PRESUMED TO BE A REDUCTION IN THE PRICE OF THE VENDORS PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AND SHOULD BE

TREATED AS A REDUCTION OF COST OF PRODUCTS WHEN RECOGNIZED IN THE CUSTOMERS INCOME STATEMENT.

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2006, WE HAVE ALSO ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 154,

ACCOUNTING CHANGES AND ERROR CORRECTIONS

(SFAS NO. 154), WHICH REQUIRES THAT CHANGES

IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES SUCH AS THE ONE DESCRIBED ABOVE BE APPLIED RETROSPECTIVELY TO ALL PERIODS PRESENTED TO THE EXTENT PRACTICABLE. CONSEQUENTLY, WE HAVE RETROSPECTIVELY ADJUSTED 2005 AND 2004 TO BE CONSISTENT WITH THE 2006 PRESENTATION. THE

CHANGE HAD NO EFFECT ON EARNINGS FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS, NET EARNINGS, RETAINED EARNINGS OR SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE CHANGE REDUCED PREVIOUSLY REPORTED SALES OF PRODUCTS AND COST OF PRODUCTS BY EQUAL AMOUNTS BOTH ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS

AND IN OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT.

SPARE PARTS REVENUE

WE

RECOGNIZE SALES OF SPARE PARTS UPON DELIVERY AND THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS RECORDED AT AVERAGE COST.

SERVICE REVENUE

SERVICE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT SERVICE AGREEMENTS, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING CONTRACT ACCOUNTING. SERVICE

ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: DELTA LAUNCHES, ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND SPACE SHUTTLE, SUPPORT AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND HELICOPTER CONTRACTS AND TECHNICAL AND FLIGHT OPERATION

SERVICES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. LEASE AND FINANCING REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN SALES OF SERVICES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. SERVICE REVENUE AND ASSOCIATED COST OF SALES FROM PAY-IN-ADVANCE SUBSCRIPTION FEES ARE

DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

REVENUE

WE RECOGNIZE FINANCIAL SERVICES REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH SALES-TYPE FINANCE LEASES, OPERATING LEASES, AND NOTES RECEIVABLE.

FOR SALES-TYPE FINANCE LEASES WE RECORD AN ASSET AT LEASE INCEPTION. THIS ASSET IS RECORDED AT THE AGGREGATE FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS, ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE

OF THE LEASED EQUIPMENT AND DEFERRED INCREMENTAL DIRECT COSTS LESS UNEARNED INCOME. INCOME IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE LEASE TO APPROXIMATE A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN ON THE NET INVESTMENT. RESIDUAL VALUES, WHICH ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY,

REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE AT LEASE TERMINATION FROM THE DISPOSITION OF LEASED EQUIPMENT. ACTUAL RESIDUAL VALUES REALIZED COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. DECLINES IN ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE THAT ARE DEEMED OTHER THAN

TEMPORARY ARE RECOGNIZED AS COST OF SERVICES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DECLINES OCCUR.

FOR OPERATING LEASES, REVENUE ON LEASED AIRCRAFT AND EQUIPMENT REPRESENTING RENTAL FEES AND FINANCING CHARGES ARE RECORDED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE. OPERATING LEASE ASSETS, INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER

FINANCING, ARE RECORDED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED OVER EITHER THE TERM OF THE LEASE OR THE ECONOMIC USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET TO AN ESTIMATED RESIDUAL OR SALVAGE VALUE BASED ON OUR INTENT TO HOLD OR DISPOSE OF THE EQUIPMENT BEFORE THE END OF ITS

ECONOMIC USEFUL LIFE, USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. PREPAYMENTS RECEIVED ON OPERATING LEASE CONTRACTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS DEFERRED LEASE INCOME ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR ESTIMATES OF RESIDUAL

VALUE AND RECOGNIZE FORECASTED DECREASES IN RESIDUAL VALUE BY PROSPECTIVELY ADJUSTING DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.

FOR NOTES RECEIVABLE, NOTES ARE RECORDED NET OF ANY UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNTS AND DEFERRED INCREMENTAL DIRECT COSTS. INTEREST INCOME AND AMORTIZATION OF ANY DISCOUNTS ARE RECORDED RATABLY OVER THE RELATED TERM

OF THE NOTE.

REINSURANCE REVENUE

OUR WHOLLY-OWNED INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY, ASTRO LTD., PARTICIPATES IN A REINSURANCE POOL

FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION. THE MEMBER AGREEMENTS AND PRACTICES OF THE REINSURANCE POOL MINIMIZE ANY PARTICIPATING MEMBERS INDIVIDUAL RISK. REINSURANCE REVENUES WERE $84 AND $101 DURING 2006 AND 2005 RESPECTIVELY. REINSURANCE COSTS RELATED

TO PREMIUMS AND CLAIMS PAID TO THE REINSURANCE POOL WERE $91 AND $115 DURING 2006 AND 2005 RESPECTIVELY. BOTH REVENUES AND COSTS ARE PRESENTED NET IN COST OF SERVICES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

FLEET SUPPORT

WE PROVIDE THE OPERATORS OF ALL OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE MODELS ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES TO FACILITATE EFFICIENT AND SAFE AIRCRAFT

OPERATION. COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS FLEET SUPPORT SERVICES, THESE ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES INCLUDE FLIGHT AND MAINTENANCE TRAINING, FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT COSTS, ENGINEERING SERVICES AND TECHNICAL DATA AND DOCUMENTS. FLEET SUPPORT ACTIVITY BEGINS PRIOR

TO AIRCRAFT DELIVERY AS THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES TRAINING, MANUALS AND TECHNICAL CONSULTING SUPPORT, AND CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE OPERATIONAL LIFE OF THE AIRCRAFT. SERVICES PROVIDED AFTER DELIVERY INCLUDE FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT, CONSULTING ON

MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES BROUGHT FORTH BY THE CUSTOMER OR REGULATORS, UPDATING MANUALS AND ENGINEERING DATA, AND THE ISSUANCE OF SERVICE BULLETINS THAT IMPACT THE ENTIRE MODELS FLEET. FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT INVOLVES OUR

PERSONNEL LOCATED AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES PROVIDING AND COORDINATING FLEET SUPPORT ACTIVITIES AND REQUESTS. THE COSTS FOR FLEET SUPPORT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AS COST OF SERVICES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (R&D) INCLUDES COSTS INCURRED FOR EXPERIMENTATION, DESIGN AND TESTING AND ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED UNLESS THE COSTS ARE RELATED TO

CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS. COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED PURSUANT TO SUCH CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE RECORDED OVER THE PERIOD THAT REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED, CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONTRACT ACCOUNTING POLICY. WE HAVE CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ARRANGEMENTS THAT MEET THE REQUIREMENT FOR BEST EFFORTS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTING. ACCORDINGLY, THE AMOUNTS FUNDED BY THE CUSTOMER ARE RECOGNIZED AS AN OFFSET TO OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE RATHER THAN AS CONTRACT REVENUES.

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOME SUPPLIERS FOR

THE 787 PROGRAM, WHICH HAVE ENHANCED OUR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES AND HAVE OFFSET A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL RISK OF DEVELOPING THIS AIRCRAFT. OUR COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS EXPLICITLY STATE THAT THE SUPPLIER CONTRIBUTIONS ARE

FOR REIMBURSEMENTS OF COSTS WE INCUR FOR EXPERIMENTATION, BASIC DESIGN AND TESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 787. IN EACH ARRANGEMENT, WE RETAIN SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS TO THE 787 PART OR COMPONENT COVERED BY THE ARRANGEMENT. THE AMOUNTS

RECEIVED FROM THESE COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES SINCE WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO REFUND ANY AMOUNTS RECEIVED PER THE ARRANGEMENTS REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

SPECIFICALLY, UNDER THE TERMS OF EACH AGREEMENT, PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS FOR THEIR SHARE OF THE COSTS ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON MILESTONES AND ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED WHEN WE ACHIEVE THE MILESTONE EVENTS AND NO ONGOING OBLIGATION ON OUR PART

EXISTS. IN THE EVENT WE RECEIVE A MILESTONE PAYMENT PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MILESTONE THE AMOUNT WILL BE CLASSIFIED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES UNTIL EARNED.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

OUR PRIMARY TYPES OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION CONSIST OF PERFORMANCE SHARES, SHAREVALUE TRUST DISTRIBUTIONS, STOCK OPTIONS AND OTHER STOCK UNIT AWARDS.

IN 2005 WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(SFAS NO. 123R) USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE METHOD. PRIOR TO 2005, WE USED A FAIR VALUE BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PROVIDED TO OUR EMPLOYEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 123. (SEE

NOTE 16.)

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INCOME TAXES

PROVISIONS FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND NON-U.S. INCOME TAXES ARE CALCULATED ON REPORTED EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES BASED ON CURRENT TAX LAW AND ALSO INCLUDE, IN THE

CURRENT PERIOD, THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ANY CHANGES IN TAX RATES FROM THOSE USED PREVIOUSLY IN DETERMINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. SUCH PROVISIONS DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNTS CURRENTLY RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE BECAUSE CERTAIN ITEMS OF INCOME

AND EXPENSE ARE RECOGNIZED IN DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES THAN FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND EVALUATING TAX POSITIONS. WE ESTABLISH RESERVES FOR INCOME

TAX WHEN, DESPITE THE BELIEF THAT OUR TAX POSITIONS ARE FULLY SUPPORTABLE, WE BELIEVE THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT OUR POSITIONS WILL BE CHALLENGED AND POSSIBLY DISALLOWED BY VARIOUS AUTHORITIES. THE CONSOLIDATED TAX PROVISION AND RELATED ACCRUALS

INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF SUCH REASONABLY ESTIMABLE LOSSES AND RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PROBABLE TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS CHANGES, SUCH CHANGES IN ESTIMATE WILL IMPACT THE INCOME TAX PROVISION IN

THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH DETERMINATION IS MADE.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

WE SPONSOR VARIOUS PENSION PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES. WE ALSO

PROVIDE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS. BENEFITS UNDER THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AGE AT

RETIREMENT AND YEARS OF SERVICE AND FOR SOME PENSION PLANS, BENEFITS ARE ALSO BASED ON THE EMPLOYEES ANNUAL EARNINGS. THE NET PERIODIC COST OF OUR PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT PLANS IS DETERMINED USING THE PROJECTED UNIT CREDIT METHOD AND

SEVERAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN, AND MEDICAL TREND (RATE OF GROWTH FOR MEDICAL COSTS). A PORTION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT INCOME OR

EXPENSE IS NOT RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS IN THE YEAR INCURRED BECAUSE IT IS ALLOCATED TO PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT COSTS, AND REFLECTED IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD. IF GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH OCCUR WHEN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE DIFFERS FROM

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, EXCEED TEN PERCENT OF THE GREATER OF PLAN ASSETS OR PLAN LIABILITIES WE AMORTIZE THEM OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD OF EMPLOYEES.

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE ADOPTED SFAS NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS  AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R)

(SFAS NO. 158) WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION REFLECT THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PENSION AND

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTUAL AMOUNTS AND ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

POSTEMPLOYMENT PLANS

WE RECORD A LIABILITY FOR POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, SUCH AS SEVERANCE OR JOB TRAINING, WHEN PAYMENT IS PROBABLE, THE AMOUNT IS

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, AND THE OBLIGATION RELATES TO RIGHTS THAT HAVE VESTED OR ACCUMULATED.

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND

STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THOSE FOR DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES. WE ROUTINELY ASSESS, BASED ON IN-DEPTH STUDIES, EXPERT ANALYSES AND LEGAL REVIEWS, OUR CONTINGENCIES,

OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RANGES AND PROBABILITIES OF RECOVERIES FROM OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO HAVE AND HAVE NOT AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT AND OF RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS.

OUR POLICY IS TO IMMEDIATELY ACCRUE AND CHARGE TO CURRENT EXPENSE

55

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IDENTIFIED EXPOSURES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SITES BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE WITHIN A RANGE OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURE FOR INVESTIGATION, CLEANUP AND

MONITORING COSTS TO BE INCURRED.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF HIGHLY LIQUID INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS CERTIFICATES

OF DEPOSIT, TIME DEPOSITS, AND OTHER MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS, WHICH HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF LESS THAN THREE MONTHS. WE AGGREGATE OUR CASH BALANCES BY BANK, AND RECLASSIFY ANY NEGATIVE BALANCES TO A LIABILITY ACCOUNT PRESENTED AS A COMPONENT OF

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIED COSTS ON COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTS INCLUDE

DIRECT ENGINEERING, PRODUCTION AND TOOLING COSTS, AND APPLICABLE OVERHEAD, WHICH INCLUDES FRINGE BENEFITS, PRODUCTION RELATED INDIRECT AND PLANT MANAGEMENT SALARIES AND PLANT SERVICES, NOT IN EXCESS OF ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE. TO THE EXTENT A

MATERIAL AMOUNT OF SUCH COSTS ARE RELATED TO AN ABNORMAL EVENT OR ARE FIXED COSTS NOT APPROPRIATELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR PROGRAMS OR CONTRACTS, THEY WILL BE EXPENSED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD RATHER THAN INVENTORIED. IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE,

INVENTORIED COSTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS RELATING TO PROGRAMS AND CONTRACTS WITH LONG PRODUCTION CYCLES, A PORTION OF WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED WITHIN ONE YEAR. INCLUDED IN INVENTORY FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS IS AN ALLOCATION OF ALLOWABLE

COSTS RELATED TO MANUFACTURING PROCESS REENGINEERING. WE NET ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS ON LONG-TERM CONTRACTS AGAINST COSTS INCURRED TO DATE FOR EACH CONTRACT IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. CONTRACTS WHERE COSTS INCURRED

TO DATE EXCEED ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS ARE REPORTED IN INVENTORIES, NET OF ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS. CONTRACTS WHERE ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS EXCEED COSTS INCURRED TO DATE ARE REPORTED IN ADVANCES AND BILLINGS IN EXCESS OF RELATED

COSTS.

BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE

BEGINNING OF A NEW OR DERIVATIVE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAM (KNOWN AS THE LEARNING CURVE EFFECT), THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED FOR PRODUCTION OF THE EARLY UNITS IN THE PROGRAM MAY EXCEED THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES FOR THOSE UNITS. IN

ADDITION, THE USE OF A TOTAL PROGRAM GROSS PROFIT RATE TO DELIVERED UNITS MAY RESULT IN COSTS ASSIGNED TO DELIVERED UNITS IN A REPORTING PERIOD BEING LESS THAN THE ACTUAL COST OF THOSE UNITS. THE EXCESS ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED OVER THE AMOUNT REPORTED

AS COST OF SALES IS DISCLOSED AS DEFERRED PRODUCTION COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORY ALONG WITH UNAMORTIZED TOOLING COSTS.

THE DETERMINATION OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF LONG-TERM CONTRACT COSTS IS BASED UPON QUARTERLY CONTRACT REVIEWS THAT DETERMINE AN ESTIMATE OF COSTS TO BE INCURRED TO

COMPLETE ALL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS. WHEN ACTUAL CONTRACT COSTS AND THE ESTIMATE TO COMPLETE EXCEED TOTAL ESTIMATED CONTRACT REVENUES, A LOSS PROVISION IS RECORDED. THE DETERMINATION OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAM COSTS IS

BASED UPON QUARTERLY PROGRAM REVIEWS THAT DETERMINE AN ESTIMATE OF REVENUE AND COST TO BE INCURRED TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. WHEN ESTIMATED COSTS TO COMPLETE EXCEED ESTIMATED PROGRAM REVENUES TO GO, A LOSS PROVISION IS RECORDED.

USED AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT AND GENERAL

STOCK MATERIALS ARE STATED AT COST NOT IN EXCESS OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE. SEE AIRCRAFT VALUATION WITHIN THIS NOTE FOR OUR VALUATION OF USED AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT. SPARE PARTS INVENTORY IS STATED AT LOWER

OF AVERAGE UNIT COST OR MARKET. WE REVIEW OUR COMMERCIAL SPARE PARTS AND GENERAL STOCK MATERIALS EACH QUARTER TO IDENTIFY IMPAIRED INVENTORY, INCLUDING EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY, BASED ON HISTORICAL SALES TRENDS, EXPECTED PRODUCTION USAGE, AND

THE SIZE AND AGE OF THE AIRCRAFT FLEET USING THE PART. IMPAIRED INVENTORIES ARE WRITTEN-OFF AS AN EXPENSE TO COST OF PRODUCTS IN THE PERIOD THE IMPAIRMENT OCCURS.

INCLUDED IN INVENTORY FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS ARE AMOUNTS PAID OR CREDITED IN CASH, OR OTHER CONSIDERATION TO CERTAIN AIRLINE

CUSTOMERS, THAT ARE REFERRED TO AS EARLY ISSUE SALES CONSIDERATION. EARLY

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ISSUE SALES CONSIDERATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE WHEN THE DELIVERY OF THE AIRCRAFT UNDER CONTRACT OCCURS. IN THE UNLIKELY SITUATION THAT AN AIRLINE

CUSTOMER WAS NOT ABLE TO PERFORM AND TAKE DELIVERY OF THE CONTRACTED AIRCRAFT, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS PAID THROUGH RETAINING AMOUNTS SECURED BY ADVANCES RECEIVED ON AIRCRAFT TO BE DELIVERED. HOWEVER, TO THE

EXTENT EARLY ISSUE SALES CONSIDERATION EXCEEDS ADVANCES AND IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE RECOVERABLE IT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS A CURRENT PERIOD EXPENSE.

PRECONTRACT COSTS

WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, INCUR COSTS TO BEGIN FULFILLING THE STATEMENT OF WORK UNDER A SPECIFIC ANTICIPATED CONTRACT THAT WE ARE STILL NEGOTIATING WITH A CUSTOMER. IF WE DETERMINE IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE AWARDED THE

SPECIFIC ANTICIPATED CONTRACT, THEN WE CAPITALIZE THE PRECONTRACT COSTS WE INCUR, EXCLUDING ANY START-UP COSTS WHICH ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. CAPITALIZED PRECONTRACT COSTS OF $40 AND $39 AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND 2005, ARE INCLUDED IN

INVENTORIES, NET OF ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST, INCLUDING APPLICABLE CONSTRUCTION-PERIOD INTEREST, LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND ARE DEPRECIATED PRINCIPALLY OVER THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATED USEFUL

LIVES: NEW BUILDINGS AND LAND IMPROVEMENTS, FROM 10 TO 40 YEARS; AND NEW MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, FROM 3 TO 20 YEARS. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF DEPRECIATION ARE AS FOLLOWS: BUILDINGS AND LAND IMPROVEMENTS, 150% DECLINING BALANCE; AND MACHINERY

AND EQUIPMENT, SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS. CAPITALIZED INTERNAL USE SOFTWARE IS INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS AND AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT LINE METHOD OVER FIVE YEARS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF REMAINING DEPRECIABLE LIVES

ASSIGNED TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING ASSETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO A MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR DISPOSITION.

WE REVIEW LONG-LIVED ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDES PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

(SFAS

NO. 144). LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR SALE ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO SELL. LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR USE ARE SUBJECT TO AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE

CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS NO LONGER RECOVERABLE BASED UPON THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

ASSET.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

ON DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB)

INTERPRETATION NO. 47,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT

NO. 143

(FIN 47).

IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 47, WE RECORD ALL KNOWN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

FOR WHICH THE LIABILITYS FAIR VALUE CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, INCLUDING CERTAIN ASBESTOS REMOVAL, ASSET DECOMMISSIONING AND CONTRACTUAL LEASE RESTORATION OBLIGATIONS. RECORDED AMOUNTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.

WE ALSO HAVE KNOWN CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, SUCH AS CERTAIN ASBESTOS

REMEDIATION AND ASSET DECOMMISSIONING ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN THE FUTURE, THAT ARE NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE TIMING AND METHOD OF SETTLEMENT OF THE OBLIGATION. ACCORDINGLY, THESE OBLIGATIONS HAVE NOT

BEEN RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A LIABILITY FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS WILL BE RECORDED IN THE PERIOD WHEN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION REGARDING TIMING AND METHOD OF SETTLEMENT BECOMES AVAILABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE

LIABILITYS FAIR VALUE. IN ADDITION, THERE MAY BE CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE NOT YET DISCOVERED (E.G. ASBESTOS MAY EXIST IN CERTAIN BUILDINGS BUT WE HAVE NOT BECOME AWARE OF IT THROUGH THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS),

AND THEREFORE, THESE OBLIGATIONS ALSO HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED, BUT ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHEN

AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SUCH THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. OUR ANNUAL TESTING DATE IS APRIL 1. IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR JANUARY 1, 2006 IDS SEGMENT REALIGNMENT, WE PERFORMED A GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT TEST IN ADDITION TO OUR ANNUAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST. BOTH TESTS RESULTED IN NO IDENTIFIED IMPAIRMENTS.

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY FIRST COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO

BE LESS THAN CARRYING VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. IN THIS PROCESS, A FAIR VALUE FOR GOODWILL IS ESTIMATED, BASED IN PART ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPERATIONS, AND IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE

SHORTFALL OF THE FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.

OUR FINITE-LIVED ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AS FOLLOWS: DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY, 5 TO 12 YEARS; PRODUCT KNOW-HOW, 30 YEARS; CUSTOMER BASE, 12 TO 15 YEARS;

AND OTHER, 2 TO 17 YEARS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144, WE EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF FINITE-LIVED ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHEN APPROPRIATE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS NO LONGER RECOVERABLE BASED UPON THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH

FLOWS OF THE ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

INVESTMENTS

WE CLASSIFY INVESTMENTS AS EITHER OPERATING OR NON-OPERATING. OPERATING INVESTMENTS ARE STRATEGIC IN NATURE, WHICH MEANS THEY ARE INTEGRAL COMPONENTS OF OUR OPERATIONS. NON-OPERATING INVESTMENTS ARE THOSE WE HOLD FOR

NON-STRATEGIC PURPOSES. EARNINGS FROM OPERATING INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING OUR SHARE OF INCOME OR LOSS FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, DIVIDEND INCOME FROM CERTAIN COST METHOD INVESTMENTS, AND ANY GAIN/LOSS ON THE DISPOSITION OF THESE INVESTMENTS, ARE

RECORDED IN INCOME FROM OPERATING INVESTMENTS, NET. OTHER INCOME ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INCOME FROM NON-OPERATING INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AS WELL AS INTEREST

INCOME RELATED TO INCOME TAXES. SEE NOTE 6.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

SECURITIES INCLUDING MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND ENHANCED EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES (EETCS) ARE RECORDED AT THEIR FAIR VALUES AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED AS PART OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE SHARES WHOSE COST IS CLOSEST TO OUR AVERAGE COST OF THE SPECIFIC SECURITY. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON ALL OTHER

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION.

THE FAIR VALUE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES IS BASED ON QUOTED MARKET PRICES. THE FAIR VALUE OF NON-PUBLICLY TRADED SECURITIES, INCLUDING CERTAIN EETCS, IS BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AT MARKET YIELD. IN CASES WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IT IS

PROBABLE THAT RECOVERY OF OUR INVESTMENT WILL COME FROM RECOVERY OF COLLATERAL, THE FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT QUARTERLY. TO DETERMINE IF AN IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY WE CONSIDER THE DURATION OF THE LOSS

POSITION, THE STRENGTH OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, THE TERM TO MATURITY, AND CREDIT RATINGS. FOR INVESTMENTS THAT ARE DEEMED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN COST OF PRODUCTS OR COST OF SERVICES AND PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON

THESE INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED USING THE COST RECOVERY METHOD.

EQUITY

METHOD INVESTMENTS

THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IS USED TO ACCOUNT FOR INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER AN INVESTEE. SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE IS GENERALLY DEEMED TO EXIST IF WE

HAVE AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE VOTING STOCK OF AN INVESTEE OF BETWEEN 20% AND 50%.

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DERIVATIVES

ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE REGARDLESS OF THE PURPOSE OR INTENT OF HOLDING THEM. WE USE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO PRINCIPALLY MANAGE A VARIETY OF MARKET RISKS. WE RECORD OUR INTEREST RATE SWAPS, NON-U.S. CURRENCY SWAPS AND COMMODITY CONTRACTS AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. FOR DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF

THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED ASSET OR LIABILITY OR A FIRM COMMITMENT (REFERRED TO AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES), THE GAIN OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE OFFSETTING LOSS OR GAIN ON THE

HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. THE EFFECT OF THAT ACCOUNTING IS TO REFLECT IN EARNINGS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HEDGE IS NOT EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE. FOR OUR CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION

OF THE DERIVATIVES GAIN OR LOSS IS INITIALLY REPORTED IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS) AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE HEDGED

FORECASTED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS OF A CASH FLOW HEDGE IS REPORTED IN EARNINGS IMMEDIATELY. WE ALSO HOLD CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS FOR ECONOMIC PURPOSES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT.

FOR THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS WELL AS OTHER DERIVATIVES NOT RECEIVING HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT, THE CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE ALSO RECORDED IN EARNINGS.

AIRCRAFT VALUATION

USED AIRCRAFT UNDER TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS AND AIRCRAFT UNDER REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNING A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF NEW

AIRCRAFT (SALE AIRCRAFT), WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SPECIFIED-PRICE TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO TRADE IN USED AIRCRAFT UPON THE PURCHASE OF SALE AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CONTINGENT

REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS WHEREIN WE AGREE TO REPURCHASE THE SALE AIRCRAFT AT A SPECIFIED PRICE, GENERALLY TEN YEARS AFTER DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT. OUR REPURCHASE OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT IS CONTINGENT UPON A FUTURE, MUTUALLY

ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT. IF WE EXECUTE AN AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT, AND IF THE CUSTOMER EXERCISES ITS RIGHT TO SELL THE SALE AIRCRAFT TO US, A CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENT WOULD

BECOME A TRADE-IN COMMITMENT. OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE IS THAT NO CONTINGENT REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS HAVE BECOME TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS.

ALL TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005 ARE SOLELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALE AIRCRAFT AND DID NOT ORIGINATE FROM CONTINGENT REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

EXPOSURE RELATED TO TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS MAY TAKE THE FORM OF.

(1)

ADJUSTMENTS TO REVENUE FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN PRICE IN THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT AND OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TRADE-IN

AIRCRAFT AS OF THE DATE OF SUCH AGREEMENT, WHICH ARE RECORDED IN INVENTORY AND RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT, AND/OR

(2)

CHARGES TO COST OF PRODUCTS FOR ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT THAT OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR SALE AIRCRAFT BUT

PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE OF THE USED TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT. ESTIMATES BASED ON CURRENT AIRCRAFT VALUES ARE INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES.

THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT IS DETERMINED USING AIRCRAFT SPECIFIC DATA SUCH AS, MODEL, AGE AND CONDITION, MARKET CONDITIONS

FOR SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT AND SIMILAR MODELS, AND MULTIPLE VALUATION SOURCES. THIS PROCESS USES OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE MARKET FOR EACH TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT, WHICH IN MOST INSTANCES BEGINS YEARS BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE AIRCRAFT. THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE

MARKETS IN WHICH WE CONTINUALLY PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO PLACE USED AIRCRAFT. THESE MARKETS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE RESALE MARKET, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY INCLUDE THE COST OF LONG-TERM STORAGE; THE LEASING MARKET,

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR REFURBISHMENT COSTS TO MEET THE LEASING CUSTOMERS REQUIREMENTS; OR THE SCRAP MARKET. TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT VALUATION VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY

DEPENDING ON WHICH MARKET WE DETERMINE IS MOST LIKELY FOR EACH AIRCRAFT. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE UPDATE OUR VALUATION ANALYSIS BASED ON THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH PLACING EACH AIRCRAFT INTO A MARKET. THIS QUARTERLY VALUATION PROCESS

YIELDS RESULTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY LOWER THAN RESIDUAL VALUE ESTIMATES BY INDEPENDENT SOURCES AND TENDS TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT RESULTS UPON THE ACTUAL PLACEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT.

USED AIRCRAFT ACQUIRED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET AS IT IS OUR

INTENT TO SELL THESE ASSETS. TO MITIGATE COSTS AND ENHANCE MARKETABILITY, AIRCRAFT MAY BE PLACED ON OPERATING LEASE. WHILE ON OPERATING LEASE, THE ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER FINANCING, HOWEVER, THE VALUATION CONTINUES TO BE BASED ON THE LOWER

OF COST OR MARKET. THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET ASSESSMENT IS PERFORMED QUARTERLY USING THE PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

ASSET VALUATION FOR ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASE, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE AND COLLATERAL UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES

INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER FINANCING ARE OPERATING LEASE EQUIPMENT, NOTES

RECEIVABLES AND SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES. SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES ARE TREATED AS RECEIVABLES, AND ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED AS NECESSARY.

WE ASSESS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS WE OWN, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE AND COLLATERAL UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES,

TO DETERMINE IF THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE LESS THAN THE RELATED ASSETS CARRYING VALUES. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CARRYING VALUES AND FAIR VALUES OF FINANCE LEASES AND NOTES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, AS DETERMINED BY COLLATERAL VALUE, ARE CONSIDERED IN

DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES.

WE USE A MEDIAN

CALCULATED FROM PUBLISHED COLLATERAL VALUES FROM MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY AIRCRAFT EVALUATIONS BASED ON THE TYPE AND AGE OF THE AIRCRAFT TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF AIRCRAFT. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WE APPLY JUDGMENT BASED ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF

THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT, USUALLY WHEN THE FEATURES OR USE OF THE AIRCRAFT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE MORE GENERIC AIRCRAFT ATTRIBUTES COVERED BY OUTSIDE PUBLICATIONS.

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE,

WE EVALUATE ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR HELD FOR RE-LEASE FOR IMPAIRMENT UTILIZING AN EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS. WE USE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS WHEN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW INCLUDING OUR INTENTION TO HOLD OR

DISPOSE OF AN ASSET BEFORE THE END OF ITS ECONOMIC USEFUL LIFE, THE EXPECTED FUTURE LEASE RATES, LEASE TERMS, RESIDUAL VALUE OF THE AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT, PERIODS IN WHICH THE ASSET MAY BE HELD IN PREPARATION FOR A FOLLOW-ON LEASE, MAINTENANCE

COSTS, REMARKETING COSTS AND THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSET. WE STATE ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING VALUE OR FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL.

WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE RECORDED IS THE EXCESS OF THE

CARRYING VALUE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

ALLOWANCE FOR

LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES

WE RECORD THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF RECEIVABLES IN OUR PORTFOLIO IN A VALUATION ACCOUNT, THE BALANCE OF WHICH IS AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE BUT UNCONFIRMED LOSSES IN THE RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO. THE ALLOWANCE

FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES RELATES TO TWO COMPONENTS OF RECEIVABLES: (A) SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AND (B) ALL OTHER RECEIVABLES.

WE DETERMINE A RECEIVABLE IS IMPAIRED WHEN, BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION AND EVENTS, IT

IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY SUBSEQUENT RESTRUCTURINGS. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING COLLECTIBILITY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO, A CUSTOMERS EXTENDED DELINQUENCY, REQUESTS FOR

RESTRUCTURING AND FILINGS FOR BANKRUPTCY. WE DETERMINE A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE AND THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL.

WE REVIEW THE ADEQUACY

OF THE ALLOWANCE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REMAINING OTHER RECEIVABLES (AFTER EXCLUDING RECEIVABLES SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCE) BY ASSESSING BOTH THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AND THE APPLICABLE CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATE. COLLATERAL EXPOSURE FOR A

PARTICULAR RECEIVABLE IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL. A RECEIVABLE WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE NO COLLATERAL EXPOSURE. THE

APPLICABLE CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATE IS DETERMINED USING TWO COMPONENTS: CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACT TERM. CREDIT RATINGS ARE DETERMINED FOR EACH CUSTOMER IN THE PORTFOLIO. THOSE RATINGS ARE UPDATED BASED UPON

PUBLIC INFORMATION AND INFORMATION OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT WOULD ENTITLE US TO LOOK BEYOND THE SPECIFIC COLLATERAL UNDERLYING THE RECEIVABLE FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. SHOULD THE PROCEEDS FROM

THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL ASSET RESULTING FROM A DEFAULT CONDITION BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR RECEIVABLE (CREATING A SHORTFALL CONDITION), THESE AGREEMENTS WOULD, FOR EXAMPLE, PERMIT US TO TAKE THE ACTIONS

NECESSARY TO SELL OR RETAIN CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS IN WHICH THE CUSTOMER HAS AN EQUITY INTEREST AND USE THE PROCEEDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL.

EACH QUARTER, WE REVIEW CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS, PUBLISHED HISTORICAL CREDIT DEFAULT RATES FOR DIFFERENT RATING CATEGORIES, AND THIRD-PARTY AIRCRAFT VALUATIONS AS A

BASIS TO VALIDATE THE REASONABLENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ACTUAL RESULTS WILL NOT DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES OR THAT THE CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTORS IN THE FUTURE WILL NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR

DECREASE TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES.

SUPPLIER PENALTIES

WE RECORD AN ACCRUAL FOR SUPPLIER PENALTIES WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS

THAT MAKES IT PROBABLE THAT A SUPPLIER PENALTY WILL BE INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. UNTIL AN EVENT OCCURS, WE FULLY ANTICIPATE ACCEPTING ALL PRODUCTS PROCURED UNDER PRODUCTION RELATED CONTRACTS.

GUARANTEES

WE ACCOUNT FOR GUARANTEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 45,

GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE

REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS

. WE RECORD A LIABILITY FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF GUARANTEES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES THAT ARE ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002. FOR

A RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE WHERE WE RECEIVED A CASH PREMIUM, THE LIABILITY IS EQUAL TO THE CASH PREMIUM RECEIVED AT THE GUARANTEES INCEPTION. FOR CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES, THE LIABILITY IS EQUAL TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED

LOSS. FOR EACH FUTURE PERIOD THE CREDIT OR PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE WILL BE OUTSTANDING, WE DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LOSS BY MULTIPLYING THE CREDITORS DEFAULT RATE BY THE GUARANTEE AMOUNT REDUCED BY THE EXPECTED RECOVERY, IF APPLICABLE. IF AT

INCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE WE DETERMINE THERE IS A PROBABLE RELATED CONTINGENT LOSS, WE WILL RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY FOR THE GREATER OF (A) THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE OR (B) THE PROBABLE CONTINGENT LOSS AMOUNT.

NOTE 2  STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

IN JUNE 2006, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED INTERPRETATION

NO. 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

(FIN 48). FIN 48 PRESCRIBES A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THRESHOLD FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THIS INTERPRETATION ALSO PROVIDES

GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES IN INTERIM

PERIODS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. THIS INTERPRETATION IS EFFECTIVE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007 AND THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF APPLYING THIS INTERPRETATION WILL BE RECORDED AS AN ADJUSTMENT TO RETAINED EARNINGS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007. ADDITIONAL

GUIDANCE FROM THE FASB ON FIN 48 IS PENDING. AS A RESULT, WE ARE CURRENTLY UNABLE TO FINALIZE OUR ESTIMATE OF THE IMPACT THAT ADOPTING THIS INTERPRETATION WILL HAVE ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

AS REQUIRED UNDER SFAS 123R, A DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY OF $306 WAS RECLASSIFIED TO ADDITIONAL PAID IN CAPITAL. THIS REPRESENTS THE TAX EFFECT OF THE NET EXCESS TAX POOL CREATED DURING 2006 DUE TO SHARE AWARDS PAID WITH A FAIR

MARKET VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE BOOK ACCRUAL FOR THOSE AWARDS.

NET INCOME

TAX PAYMENTS/(REFUNDS) WERE $28, ($344) AND ($903) IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX IN THE AMOUNT OF $48 ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS NOT CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN OUR NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED FOR U.S.

DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OR FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX ON THE REMAINDER OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FROM OUR NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED AND IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF TAX THAT

MAY BE PAYABLE UPON DISTRIBUTION.

WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

OPERATIONS, OTHER INCOME INCLUDED INTEREST OF $16 IN 2006, $100 IN 2005 AND $219 IN 2004 RELATED TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX SETTLEMENTS FOR PRIOR YEARS.

CONTINGENCIES

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S. AND NUMEROUS NON-U.S. JURISDICTIONS.

THE ACCRUALS ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. FEDERAL TAX ISSUES SUCH AS THE TAX BENEFITS FROM THE FOREIGN SALES CORPORATION/EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME (FSC/ETI) TAX RULES, THE AMOUNT OF

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS CLAIMED, U.S. TAXATION OF NON-U.S. EARNINGS, AND VALUATION ISSUES REGARDING CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS CLAIMED WERE $841 AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, AND $771 AT DECEMBER 31, 2005. IRS EXAMINATIONS HAVE BEEN

COMPLETED THROUGH 2001. WE HAVE FILED AN APPEAL WITH THE IRS FOR 1998-2001. DURING 2006, WE SETTLED THE MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION APPEAL FOR 1993-1997 WHICH HAD THE EFFECT OF DECREASING FEDERAL INCOME TAX EXPENSE BY $46.

·

THE ACCRUALS FOR DOMESTIC STATE TAX ISSUES SUCH AS THE ALLOCATION OF INCOME AMONG VARIOUS STATE TAX JURISDICTIONS AND THE AMOUNT OF STATE TAX CREDITS CLAIMED WERE $88 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND $98 AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, NET OF FEDERAL BENEFIT.

·

THE ACCRUALS ASSOCIATED WITH TAXATION OF NON-U.S. EARNINGS WERE $31 AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005.

SAVINGS. THE CONSOLIDATED NET LOSS ON THIS SALE RECORDED IN 2005 WAS $287, INCLUDING PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT IMPACTS. WE RECOGNIZED A LOSS OF $103 IN 2005 IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS AS GAIN ON DISPOSITIONS, NET, OF WHICH $68

WAS RECOGNIZED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT AND $35 WAS RECOGNIZED AS ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS AND UNALLOCATED EXPENSE. THE REMAINING LOSS OF $184 RELATED TO ESTIMATED PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT CURTAILMENTS AND SETTLEMENTS, WAS

RECORDED IN OUR OTHER SEGMENT IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2005. IN 2006, A $15 GAIN WAS RECORDED FOR A SUBSEQUENT PURCHASE PRICE ADJUSTMENT ON THE SALE.

CREDIT BALANCES ARE A RESULT OF OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF THE JOINT VENTURES PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT RELATED ADJUSTMENTS WHICH REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE

INVESTMENT.

ON DECEMBER 1, 2006 WE CLOSED THE

TRANSACTION WITH LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION (LOCKHEED) TO CREATE A 50/50 JOINT VENTURE NAMED UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE L.L.C. (ULA). ULA COMBINES THE PRODUCTION, ENGINEERING, TEST AND LAUNCH OPERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES OF

BOEING DELTA AND LOCKHEED ATLAS ROCKETS. AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSACTION, WE CONTRIBUTED ASSETS OF $1,609, GENERALLY CONSISTING OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE OF $372, INVENTORIES, NET OF ADVANCES, OF $156 AND PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT OF $1,080, AND

LIABILITIES OF $695, CONSISTING OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES OF $536 AND ADVANCES AND BILLINGS IN EXCESS OF RELATED COSTS OF $159 TO ULA IN

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXCHANGE FOR 50% OWNERSHIP. THESE AMOUNTS ARE SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT PENDING FINAL REVIEW OF THE RESPECTIVE PARTIES CONTRIBUTIONS. WE WILL EACH PROVIDE ULA WITH

AN INITIAL CASH CONTRIBUTION OF UP TO $25, AND WE EACH HAVE AGREED TO EXTEND A LINE OF CREDIT TO ULA OF UP TO $200 TO SUPPORT ITS WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. SEE NOTES 8, 9 AND 23.

THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE, IN WHICH WE ARE A 40% PARTNER WITH RSC ENERGIA OF RUSSIA (25%), AKER ASA OF NORWAY (20%), AND KB YUZHNOYE/PO

YUZHMASH OF THE UKRAINE (15%), PROVIDES OCEAN-BASED LAUNCH SERVICES TO COMMERCIAL SATELLITE CUSTOMERS. THE VENTURE CONDUCTED FIVE, FOUR AND THREE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. THE

VENTURE INCURRED LOSSES IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004 DUE TO THE RELATIVELY LOW PRICE AND VOLUME OF LAUNCHES, DRIVEN BY A DEPRESSED COMMERCIAL SATELLITE MARKET AND OVERSUPPLY OF LAUNCH VEHICLES AS WELL AS A HIGH LEVEL OF DEBT AND DEBT SERVICING

REQUIREMENTS. WE HAVE FINANCIAL EXPOSURE WITH RESPECT TO THE VENTURE, WHICH RELATES TO GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY US TO CERTAIN SEA LAUNCH CREDITORS, PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY US TO A SEA LAUNCH CUSTOMER AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE RELATED TO

ADVANCES AND OTHER ASSETS REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE SUSPENDED RECORDING EQUITY LOSSES AFTER WRITING OUR INVESTMENT IN AND DIRECT LOANS TO SEA LAUNCH DOWN TO ZERO IN 2001 AND ACCRUING OUR OBLIGATION FOR THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES ON SEA LAUNCH INDEBTEDNESS. WE ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE ANY

FURTHER FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT THAT WE DO EXTEND ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO SEA LAUNCH IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL RECOGNIZE SUSPENDED LOSSES AS APPROPRIATE.

A SEA LAUNCH ZENIT-3SL VEHICLE, CARRYING A BOEING-BUILT SATELLITE, EXPERIENCED AN

ANOMALY DURING LAUNCH ON JANUARY 30, 2007. THE IMPACT TO SEA LAUNCH OPERATIONS, INCLUDING THE REMAINING LAUNCHES SCHEDULED FOR 2007 IS NOT YET KNOWN. BASED ON OUR PRELIMINARY ASSESSMENT, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT THIS ANOMALY WILL

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR CASH FLOWS.

NOTE 14  DEBT

WE HAVE $3,000 CURRENTLY AVAILABLE UNDER CREDIT LINE AGREEMENTS. BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION (BCC) IS NAMED A SUBSIDIARY BORROWER FOR UP TO $1,500 UNDER THESE

ARRANGEMENTS. TOTAL DEBT INTEREST INCURRED, INCLUDING AMOUNTS CAPITALIZED, WAS $657, $713, AND $790 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. INTEREST EXPENSE RECORDED BY BCC IS REFLECTED AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, AND IS INCLUDED IN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS. TOTAL COMPANY INTEREST PAYMENTS WERE $657, $671, AND $722 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. WE CONTINUE TO BE IN FULL

COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS CONTAINED IN OUR DEBT OR CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE AT BCC.

ON JUNE 6, 2002, BCC ESTABLISHED A EURO MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,500. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, BCC HAD ZERO DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE PROGRAM SUCH THAT $1,500 WOULD

NORMALLY BE AVAILABLE FOR POTENTIAL DEBT ISSUANCE. HOWEVER, DEBT ISSUANCE UNDER THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES THAT DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION AND OTHER PROCEDURES RELATING TO BCC AND THE PROGRAM BE UPDATED WITHIN THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS. IN VIEW OF

BCCS CASH POSITION AND OTHER AVAILABLE FUNDING SOURCES, BCC DETERMINED DURING 2004 THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY THEY WOULD NEED TO USE THIS PROGRAM IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE PROGRAM IS THUS INACTIVE BUT AVAILABLE WITH UPDATED REGISTRATION

STATEMENTS.

ON MARCH 23, 2004, WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION WITH

THE SEC FOR $1,000 FOR THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES AND UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK. THE ENTIRE AMOUNT REMAINS AVAILABLE FOR POTENTIAL DEBT ISSUANCE. BCC HAS $3,421 THAT REMAINS AVAILABLE FROM SHELF REGISTRATIONS FILED WITH THE SEC. BOTH SHELF

NOTE 15  POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

WE HAVE VARIOUS PENSION PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES. WE FUND ALL OUR MAJOR PENSION PLANS THROUGH TRUSTS. PENSION ASSETS

ARE PLACED IN TRUST SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PLANS PARTICIPANTS, AND ARE STRUCTURED TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO PAY BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS TO KEEP PACE OVER THE LONG TERM WITH THE GROWTH OF OBLIGATIONS FOR FUTURE

BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

WE ALSO HAVE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN

PENSIONS WHICH CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, LIFE INSURANCE TO CERTAIN GROUPS OF RETIREES. RETIREE HEALTH CARE IS PROVIDED PRINCIPALLY UNTIL AGE 65 FOR

APPROXIMATELY HALF THOSE RETIREES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. CERTAIN EMPLOYEE GROUPS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES COVERED BY MOST UNITED AUTO WORKERS BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, ARE PROVIDED LIFETIME HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. WE USE A MEASUREMENT

DATE OF SEPTEMBER 30 FOR OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT (OPB) PLANS.

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE ADOPTED SFAS NO. 158, WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION REFLECT THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE

PLANS IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PLAN ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE AND THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION. WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE AGGREGATE OF ALL OVERFUNDED PLANS IN OTHER ASSETS AND THE AGGREGATE OF ALL UNDERFUNDED PLANS IN EITHER ACCRUED

RETIREE HEALTH CARE OR ACCRUED PENSION PLAN LIABILITY. THE PORTION OF THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE ACTUARIAL PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFITS INCLUDED IN THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS, PAYABLE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, IS

REFLECTED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES.

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006, PREVIOUSLY UNRECOGNIZED DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL AMOUNTS AND ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS ARE INCLUDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS REQUIRED BY

SFAS NO. 158. IN FUTURE REPORTING PERIODS, THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN ACTUAL AMOUNTS AND ESTIMATES BASED ON ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS WILL BE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR.

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2008, SFAS NO. 158 WILL REQUIRE US TO MEASURE PLAN

ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT FISCAL YEAR END. WE CURRENTLY PERFORM THIS MEASUREMENT AT SEPTEMBER 30 OF EACH YEAR. IN ADDITION, BEGINNING IN FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007, THIS STANDARD WILL REQUIRE US TO ELIMINATE THE USE OF A THREE-MONTH LAG

PERIOD WHEN RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT OF CURTAILMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS AND INSTEAD, RECOGNIZE THESE AMOUNTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 158 DO NOT PERMIT RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION.

IN 2005, WE MODIFIED OUR METHOD

OF DETERMINING THE DISCOUNT RATE SO THAT THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL PENSION PLAN IS DETERMINED SEPARATELY BASED ON THE DURATION OF EACH PLANS LIABILITIES. PREVIOUSLY, WE DETERMINED A SINGLE DISCOUNT RATE FOR ALL OUR POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLANS. WE MADE THE CHANGE MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE DIVERGENCE IN THE POPULATIONS OF OUR VARIOUS PLANS DUE TO EMPLOYEE TRANSFERS, LAYOFFS AND DIVESTITURES. THE NEW METHOD CONTINUES TO INCLUDE A MATCHING OF THE PLANS EXPECTED FUTURE BENEFIT

PAYMENTS AGAINST A YIELD CURVE THATS BASED ON HIGH QUALITY, NON-CALLABLE BONDS IN THE BLOOMBERG INDEX AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE, OMITTING BONDS WITH THE TEN PERCENT HIGHEST AND

81

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TEN PERCENT LOWEST YIELDS. THE DISCLOSED RATE IS THE AVERAGE RATE FOR ALL THE PLANS, WEIGHTED BY THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006,

THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE WAS 5.9%, AND THE RATES FOR INDIVIDUAL PLANS RANGED FROM 5.00% TO 6.00%. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2005, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE WAS 5.50%, AND THE RATES FOR INDIVIDUAL PLANS RANGED FROM 5.00% TO 6.00%.

THE PENSION FUNDS EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS ASSUMPTION IS DERIVED FROM AN

EXTENSIVE STUDY CONDUCTED BY OUR TRUST INVESTMENTS GROUP AND ITS ACTUARIES ON A PERIODIC BASIS. THE STUDY INCLUDES A REVIEW OF ACTUAL HISTORICAL RETURNS ACHIEVED BY THE PENSION TRUST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL ASSET

CLASSES WITH CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO THE RELATED INVESTMENT STRATEGY. WHILE THE STUDY GIVES APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATION TO RECENT TRUST PERFORMANCE AND HISTORICAL RETURNS, THE ASSUMPTION REPRESENTS A LONG-TERM PROSPECTIVE RETURN. THE EXPECTED RETURN ON

PLAN ASSETS DETERMINED ON EACH MEASUREMENT DATE IS USED TO CALCULATE THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST/(INCOME) FOR THE UPCOMING PLAN YEAR.

PLAN ASSETS

PENSION ASSETS TOTALED $46,203 AND $43,484 AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND 2005. IN

LATE 2006, THE PENSION ASSET STRATEGY WAS MODIFIED, WITH A GOAL TO REDUCE VOLATILITY RELATIVE TO PENSION LIABILITIES, ACHIEVE A COMPETITIVE INVESTMENT RETURN, ACHIEVE DIVERSIFICATION BETWEEN AND WITHIN VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES, AND MANAGE OTHER RISKS.

IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE VOLATILITY BETWEEN THE VALUE OF PENSION ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE COMPANY IS INCREASING ITS ALLOCATION TO FIXED INCOME SECURITIES AND INCREASING THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED INCOME HOLDINGS. THE COMPANY WILL ADDITIONALLY

ADDRESS RETURN AND DIVERSIFICATION OBJECTIVES BY INCREASING ITS ALLOCATION TO ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS PRIVATE EQUITY, REAL ESTATE, REAL ASSETS, AND HEDGE FUNDS. KEY RISK MANAGEMENT AREAS WHICH WE ADDRESS THROUGH THIS MODIFIED STRATEGY

INCLUDE FUNDED STATUS RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, AND LIQUIDITY.

ACTUAL INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS VARY FROM TARGET ALLOCATIONS DUE TO PERIODIC INVESTMENT STRATEGY CHANGES AND THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO COMPLETE INVESTMENTS IN ASSET CLASSES SUCH AS PRIVATE EQUITY, REAL ESTATE, AND OTHER

INVESTMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, ACTUAL AND TARGET ALLOCATIONS VARY DUE TO THE TIMING OF BENEFIT PAYMENTS OR CONTRIBUTIONS MADE ON OR NEAR THE MEASUREMENT DATE, SEPTEMBER 30.

PENSION INVESTMENT MANAGERS ARE RETAINED WITH A SPECIFIC INVESTMENT ROLE AND CORRESPONDING INVESTMENT GUIDELINES. INVESTMENT MANAGERS

HAVE THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE SECURITIES ON BEHALF OF THE PENSION FUND AND INVEST IN DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS EQUITY OR BOND FUTURES, SWAPS, OPTIONS, OR CURRENCY FORWARDS. DERIVATIVES GENERALLY ARE USED TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED MARKET EXPOSURE OF A

SECURITY OR AN INDEX, TO TRANSFER VALUE-ADDED PERFORMANCE BETWEEN ASSET CLASSES, ACHIEVE THE DESIRED CURRENCY EXPOSURE, ADJUST PORTFOLIO DURATION, OR REBALANCE THE TOTAL PORTFOLIO TO THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION.

EQUITY INCLUDES DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES, SUCH AS COMMON, PREFERRED OR OTHER CAPITAL STOCK, AS WELL AS EQUITY FUTURES, CURRENCY FORWARDS AND RESIDUAL CASH ALLOCATED TO THE EQUITY MANAGERS. EQUITY INCLUDES OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE AMOUNTS OF $1,260 (2.8% OF

PLAN ASSETS) AND $1,494 (3.4% OF PLAN ASSETS) AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND 2005. A CURRENCY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY WAS IMPLEMENTED DURING 2006 WHICH USES CURRENCY FORWARDS AND OPTIONS. EQUITY AND CURRENCY MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES BASED ON NET NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS TOTALED 6.6% AND 2.3% OF PLAN ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND 2005.

DEBT INCLUDES DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL DEBT SECURITIES, SUCH AS U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES, CORPORATE BONDS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER; CASH EQUIVALENTS; INVESTMENTS IN BOND DERIVATIVES SUCH AS BOND FUTURES,

OPTIONS, SWAPS AND CURRENCY FORWARDS; AND REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK AND CONVERTIBLE DEBT. BOND DERIVATIVES BASED ON NET NOTIONAL AMOUNTS TOTALED 7.0% AND 3.9% OF PLAN ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND 2005. ADDITIONALLY, DEBT INCLUDES

TO-BE-ANNOUNCED MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (TBA), WHICH ARE CONTRACTS TO BUY OR SELL MORTGAGE- BACKED SECURITIES TO BE DELIVERED AT A FUTURE AGREED UPON DATE, AND TREASURY FORWARDS, WHICH SIMILARLY HAVE DELAYED, FUTURE

SETTLEMENT DATES. DEBT INCLUDED $1,770 AND $1,549 RELATED TO TBA SECURITIES AND TREASURY FORWARDS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND 2005.

PRIVATE EQUITY REPRESENTS PRIVATE MARKET INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE GENERALLY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. REAL ESTATE INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC REAL ESTATE.

THE OTHER CATEGORY INCLUDES ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS SUCH AS REAL ASSETS, GLOBAL TACTICAL ASSET ALLOCATION STRATEGIES, AND HEDGE FUNDS.

WE HELD $89 AND $82 IN TRUST FUND ASSETS FOR OPB PLANS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2006 AND 2005. MOST OF THESE FUNDS ARE INVESTED IN A BALANCED INDEX FUND WHICH IS

COMPRISED OF APPROXIMATELY 60% EQUITIES AND 40% DEBT SECURITIES. THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON THESE ASSETS DOES NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST.

CASH FLOWS

CONTRIBUTIONS

REQUIRED PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) REGULATIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL IN 2007. IN

FEBRUARY 2007, WE MADE A DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION TO OUR PLANS OF $509 (PRE-TAX). WE WILL EVALUATE ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS LATER IN THE YEAR. WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $17 TO OUR OPB PLANS IN 2007.

ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS

TERMINATION PROVISIONS

CERTAIN OF THE PENSION PLANS PROVIDE THAT, IN THE EVENT THERE IS A CHANGE IN CONTROL

OF THE COMPANY WHICH IS NOT APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE PLANS ARE TERMINATED WITHIN FIVE YEARS THEREAFTER, THE ASSETS IN THE PLAN FIRST WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS REQUIRED BY ERISA, AND THEN ANY SURPLUS

WILL BE USED TO FUND A TRUST TO CONTINUE PRESENT AND FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS IN OUR GROUP INSURANCE BENEFIT PROGRAMS.

WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN PENSION PLANS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, SHOULD WE TERMINATE ANY OF

THE PLANS UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE PLANS ASSETS EXCEED THAT PLANS OBLIGATIONS, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL BE ENTITLED TO A FAIR ALLOCATION OF ANY OF THE PLANS ASSETS BASED ON PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE REIMBURSED UNDER U.S.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

401(K)

WE PROVIDE CERTAIN DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS TO ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. THE PRINCIPAL

PLANS ARE THE COMPANY-SPONSORED 401(K) PLANS. THE EXPENSE FOR THESE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS WAS $514, $483 AND $468 IN 2006, 2005 AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 16  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

ON APRIL 28, 2003, THE SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED THE BOEING COMPANY 2003 INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN (2003 PLAN). THE 2003 PLAN PERMITS AWARDS OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED

STOCK, STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE SHARES, PERFORMANCE UNITS AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, CONSULTANTS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR STOCK AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 2003 PLAN WILL NOT

EXCEED 60,000,000. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE 2003 PLAN, NO MORE THAN AN AGGREGATE OF 6,000,000 SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.

OUR 1997 INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN (1997 PLAN) PERMITS THE GRANT OF STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS) AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS (DENOMINATED IN STOCK OR

STOCK UNITS) TO EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACT EMPLOYEES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PLAN, 64,000,000 SHARES ARE AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UPON EXERCISE OF OPTIONS, AS PAYMENT OF SARS AND AS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS, OF WHICH NO MORE THAN AN AGGREGATE OF 6,000,000

SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS. THIS AUTHORIZATION FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 1997 PLAN WILL TERMINATE ON APRIL 30, 2007.

SHARES ISSUED AS A RESULT OF STOCK OPTION EXERCISE OR CONVERSION OF STOCK UNIT AWARDS WILL BE FUNDED OUT OF TREASURY SHARES EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE

INSUFFICIENT TREASURY SHARES IN WHICH CASE NEW SHARES WILL BE ISSUED. WE BELIEVE WE CURRENTLY HAVE ADEQUATE TREASURY SHARES TO MEET ANY REQUIREMENTS TO ISSUE SHARES DURING 2007.

ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R

WE EARLY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123R AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2005 USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE METHOD. UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R, WE RECORDED AN INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS OF $21, NET OF TAXES OF $12, AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE DUE TO SFAS NO. 123RS

REQUIREMENT TO APPLY AN ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE TO UNVESTED AWARDS. PREVIOUSLY WE EXPENSED FORFEITURES AS INCURRED. SFAS NO. 123R ALSO RESULTED IN CHANGES IN OUR METHODS OF MEASURING AND AMORTIZING COMPENSATION COST OF OUR PERFORMANCE SHARES.

FOR PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED PRIOR TO 2005, SHARE-BASED EXPENSE WAS

MEASURED BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK ON THE AWARD DATE AND WAS GENERALLY AMORTIZED OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. FOR PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED IN 2005, THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD WAS MEASURED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING A MONTE CARLO

SIMULATION MODEL. THE MONTE CARLO MODEL ALSO COMPUTED AN EXPECTED TERM FOR EACH PERFORMANCE SHARE. WE CHANGED OUR VALUATION METHOD BASED ON FURTHER CLARIFICATION PROVIDED IN SFAS NO. 123R AND THE FACT THAT OUR PERFORMANCE SHARES CONTAIN A

MARKET CONDITION, WHICH SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF AN AWARD. THE MONTE CARLO SIMULATION MODEL UTILIZES MULTIPLE INPUT VARIABLES THAT DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF SATISFYING EACH MARKET CONDITION STIPULATED IN THE AWARD

GRANT.

ADDITIONALLY, PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R, WE

AMORTIZED COMPENSATION COST FOR SHARE-BASED AWARDS OVER THE STATED VESTING PERIOD FOR RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND, IF AN EMPLOYEE RETIRED BEFORE THE END OF THE VESTING PERIOD, WE RECOGNIZED ANY REMAINING UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST AT THE

DATE OF RETIREMENT. AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 123R, FOR ALL SHARE-BASED AWARDS GRANTED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2005, WE RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION COST FOR RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OVER THE GREATER OF ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF GRANT OR

THE PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT TO THE EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT ELIGIBILITY DATE (NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING APPROACH). HAD WE ALSO APPLIED THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING APPROACH TO AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO 2005, COMPENSATION EXPENSE WOULD HAVE BEEN

$50 AND $96 LOWER AND $59 HIGHER FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004.

PERFORMANCE SHARES

PERFORMANCE SHARES ARE STOCK UNITS

THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE TO COMMON STOCK, ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS, CONTINGENT UPON STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE. IF, AT ANY TIME UP TO FIVE YEARS AFTER AWARD, THE STOCK PRICE REACHES AND MAINTAINS FOR TWENTY CONSECUTIVE DAYS A PRICE EQUAL TO STATED PRICE

GROWTH TARGETS, A STATED PERCENTAGE (UP TO 125%) OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED ARE VESTED AND CONVERTIBLE TO COMMON STOCK. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE CUMULATIVE VESTING PERCENTAGES BASED ON THE CUMULATIVE GROWTH RATE OF THE STOCK ABOVE THE

STOCK PRICE AT THE GRANT DATE FOR PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED IN 2002.

IN THE EVENT A PARTICIPANTS

EMPLOYMENT TERMINATES DUE TO RETIREMENT, LAYOFF, DISABILITY, OR DEATH, THE PARTICIPANT (OR BENEFICIARY) CONTINUES TO PARTICIPATE IN PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR. IN ALL OTHER CASES, PARTICIPANTS FORFEIT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004, WE RECORDED $120, $124 AND $57, RESPECTIVELY, OF ADDITIONAL

COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO ACCELERATE THE AMORTIZATION OF COMPENSATION COST FOR THOSE PERFORMANCE SHARES CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK OR DEFERRED AS STOCK OR CASH AT THE EMPLOYEES ELECTION.

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED IN 2005 WERE MEASURED ON THE DATE OF

GRANT USING A MONTE CARLO MODEL. ADDITIONALLY, WE BEGAN TO REMEASURE CERTAIN PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT HAVE A CASH SETTLEMENT FEATURE AS LIABILITY AWARDS BEGINNING SEPTEMBER 30, 2005. LIABILITY AWARDS VESTING AND TRANSFERRED INTO DEFERRED

COMPENSATION PLANS TOTALED $98 AND $9 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005. THE KEY ASSUMPTIONS USED FOR VALUING PERFORMANCE SHARES IN 2006 AND 2005 FOLLOW.

WEIGHTED AVERAGE EXPECTED

VOLATILITY IS BASED ON RECENT VOLATILITY LEVELS IMPLIED BY ACTIVELY TRADED OPTION CONTRACTS ON OUR COMMON STOCK AND THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITY LEVELS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. EXPECTED DIVIDEND YIELD IS BASED ON HISTORICAL DIVIDEND PAYMENTS. RISK FREE

INTEREST RATE REFLECTS THE YIELD ON THE ZERO COUPON U.S. TREASURY BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE SHARES REMAINING CONTRACTUAL TERM. STOCK BETA IS A MEASURE OF HOW OUR STOCK PRICE MOVES RELATIVE TO THE MARKET AS A WHOLE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE 2005

PERFORMANCE SHARES IS AMORTIZED OVER THE EXPECTED TERM OF EACH AWARD. THE EXPECTED TERM OF 1 TO 4 YEARS FOR EACH AWARD GRANTED IS DERIVED FROM THE OUTPUT OF THE VALUATION MODEL AND REPRESENTS THE MEDIAN TIME REQUIRED TO SATISFY THE CONDITIONS OF THE

AWARD, ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECT OF RETIREE ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS. EACH PRICE GROWTH TARGET HAS A DIFFERENT EXPECTED TERM, RESULTING IN THE RANGE OF VALUES PROVIDED.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THERE WAS $134 OF UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN WHICH IS EXPECTED TO

BE RECOGNIZED OVER A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PERIOD OF 1.3 YEARS. IN CONNECTION WITH PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT HAVE NOT MET THE MARKET CONDITIONS, WE RECLASSIFIED $288 FROM ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL TO OTHER LIABILITIES AND RECOGNIZED A CUMULATIVE

ADJUSTMENT TO GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE OF $88 DURING 2005. ADDITIONALLY, EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE MODIFIED OUR DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION PLAN TO REQUIRE ALL PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT WERE UNVESTED AND DEFERRED AS STOCK UNITS TO

BE SETTLED IN STOCK. WE ALSO GAVE PARTICIPANTS IN OUR DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION PLAN A ONE-TIME OPPORTUNITY TO CANCEL THEIR DEFERRAL ELECTION FOR UNVESTED PERFORMANCE SHARES OR TO CHANGE THEIR DEFERRAL ELECTION FOR UNVESTED PERFORMANCE SHARES TO A

DEFERRED INTEREST ACCOUNT. AS A RESULT, WE RECLASSIFIED $213 FROM OTHER LIABILITIES TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL AT DECEMBER 31, 2005, FOR UNVESTED PERFORMANCE SHARES DEFERRED AS STOCK UNITS AND FOR UNVESTED PERFORMANCE SHARES NO LONGER BEING

DEFERRED. THESE MODIFICATIONS RESULTED IN NO INCREMENTAL COMPENSATION COST. FOR PARTICIPANTS WHO HAD DEFERRED UNVESTED PERFORMANCE SHARES IN STOCK UNITS AND CANCELLED OR CHANGED THEIR DEFERRAL ELECTION EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE REVERSED

$13 OF PREVIOUSLY RECORDED COMPENSATION EXPENSE RELATED TO THE 25% MATCHING CONTRIBUTION WHICH WAS FORFEITED. 268 EMPLOYEES WERE AFFECTED BY THE MODIFICATION.

STOCK OPTIONS

OPTIONS HAVE BEEN GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF OUR STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT. FOR STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED PRIOR TO 2006, VESTING IS GENERALLY OVER A

FIVE-YEAR SERVICE PERIOD WITH PORTIONS OF A GRANT BECOMING EXERCISABLE AT ONE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

YEAR, THREE YEARS AND FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT. IN THE EVENT AN EMPLOYEE HAS A TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DUE TO RETIREMENT, LAYOFF, DISABILITY OR DEATH, THE

EMPLOYEE (OR BENEFICIARY) IMMEDIATELY VESTS IN GRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR.

ON FEBRUARY 27, 2006 WE GRANTED TO OUR EXECUTIVES 6,361,100 OPTIONS WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF OUR STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE STOCK OPTIONS VEST OVER A PERIOD OF

THREE YEARS, WITH 34% VESTING AFTER THE FIRST YEAR, 33% VESTING AFTER THE SECOND YEAR AND THE REMAINING 33% VESTING AFTER THE THIRD YEAR. THE OPTIONS EXPIRE 10 YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT. IF AN EXECUTIVE TERMINATES FOR ANY REASON, THE NON-VESTED

PORTION OF THE STOCK OPTION WILL NOT VEST AND ALL RIGHTS TO THE NON-VESTED PORTION WILL TERMINATE COMPLETELY.

SHAREVALUE TRUST

THE SHAREVALUE TRUST, ESTABLISHED EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 1996, IS A 14-YEAR

IRREVOCABLE TRUST THAT HOLDS OUR COMMON STOCK, RECEIVES DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTES TO EMPLOYEES THE APPRECIATION IN VALUE ABOVE A 3% PER ANNUM THRESHOLD RATE OF RETURN AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD. THE TOTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO BE RECOGNIZED

OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRUST WAS DETERMINED USING A BINOMIAL OPTION-PRICING MODEL AND WAS NOT AFFECTED BY ADOPTION OF SFAS NO.123R.

THE TRUST WAS SPLIT BETWEEN TWO FUNDS, FUND 1 AND FUND 2, UPON ITS INITIAL FUNDING. EACH FUND CONSISTS OF INVESTMENT PERIODS WHICH RESULT IN

OVERLAPPING PERIODS AS FOLLOWS.

PERIOD 1 (FUND 1).

JULY 1, 1996 TO JUNE 30, 1998

PERIOD 2 (FUND 2).

JULY 1, 1996 TO JUNE 30, 2000

PERIOD 3 (FUND 1).

PERIOD 5 (FUND 1).

JULY 1, 2002 TO JUNE 30, 2006

PERIOD 6 (FUND 2).

JULY 1, 2004 TO JUNE 30, 2008

PERIOD 7 (FUND 1).

JULY 1, 2006 TO JUNE 30, 2010

AN INITIAL INVESTMENT VALUE IS

ESTABLISHED FOR EACH INVESTMENT PERIOD BASED ON THE LESSER OF EITHER (1) FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE FUND OR (2) THE PRIOR ENDING BALANCE OF THAT FUND. THIS AMOUNT IS THEN COMPOUNDED BY THE 3% PER ANNUM TO DETERMINE THE THRESHOLD AMOUNT

THAT MUST BE MET FOR THAT INVESTMENT PERIOD. AT THE END OF THE INVESTMENT PERIOD, THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IN EXCESS OF THE THRESHOLD AMOUNT WILL RESULT IN A DISTRIBUTION TO PARTICIPANTS. A DISTRIBUTION IS PROPORTIONALLY DISTRIBUTED IN THE RATIO

EACH PARTICIPANTS NUMBER OF MONTHS OF PARTICIPATION WHICH RELATES TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF MONTHS EARNED BY ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE INVESTMENT PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE TRUST HELD 30,903,026 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE TWO

FUNDS.

BASED ON THE AVERAGE STOCK PRICE OF $82.285 AS OF JUNE 30,

2006, THE MARKET VALUE OF FUND 1 EXCEEDED THE THRESHOLD OF $1,004 BY $758. THIS EXCESS WAS PAID IN BOEING COMMON STOCK, EXCEPT FOR PARTIAL SHARES AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES AND BENEFICIARIES OF DECEASED PARTICIPANTS, WHICH WERE PAID IN

CASH. AFTER EMPLOYEE WITHHOLDING TAXES OF $265, WHICH WERE RECORDED AS A LIABILITY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 AND WERE PAID IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006, 5.6 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE DISTRIBUTED TO PARTICIPANTS DURING THE THIRD

QUARTER OF 2006. THESE DISTRIBUTIONS WERE RECORDED AS A DEDUCTION TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL. IN ADDITION, RELATED EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAXES OF $59 WERE EXPENSED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006.

IF ON JUNE 30, 2008, THE MARKET VALUE OF FUND 2 EXCEEDS $1,028, THE AMOUNT IN

EXCESS OF THE THRESHOLD WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO EMPLOYEES IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. SIMILARLY, IF ON JUNE 30, 2010, THE MARKET VALUE OF FUND 1 EXCEEDS $1,130, THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE THRESHOLD WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO EMPLOYEES IN SHARES OF

COMMON STOCK. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 THE MARKET VALUES OF FUND 1 AND 2 WERE $1,094 AND $1,659.

89

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE SHAREVALUE TRUST IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CONTRA-EQUITY ACCOUNT AND STATED AT MARKET VALUE. MARKET VALUE

ADJUSTMENTS ARE OFFSET TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006, THERE WAS $252 OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO THE SHAREVALUE TRUST WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A PERIOD OF 3.5 YEARS.

OTHER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

PERFORMANCE AWARDS

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, WE GRANTED PERFORMANCE AWARDS TO OUR EXECUTIVES. PERFORMANCE AWARDS ARE CASH UNITS THAT PAYOUT BASED

ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF LONG-TERM FINANCIAL GOALS AT THE END OF A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. EACH UNIT HAS AN INITIAL VALUE OF $100 DOLLARS. THE AMOUNT PAYABLE AT THE END OF THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD MAY BE ANYWHERE FROM ZERO TO $200 DOLLARS PER UNIT,

DEPENDING ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLAN FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE HAS THE DISCRETION TO PAY THESE AWARDS IN CASH, STOCK, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH AFTER THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE

PERIOD.

THE 2009 PAYOUT ASSUMING TARGET PERFORMANCE WOULD BE

APPROXIMATELY $132. THE MINIMUM AMOUNT IS ZERO AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAYOUT FOR THE PERFORMANCE AWARDS IS $263. COMPENSATION EXPENSE, BASED ON THE ESTIMATED PERFORMANCE PAYOUT, IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERFORMANCE

PERIOD.

DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY HAS A DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN WHICH PERMITS EXECUTIVES TO DEFER RECEIPT

OF A PORTION OF THEIR SALARY, BONUS, AND CERTAIN OTHER INCENTIVE AWARDS. PRIOR TO MAY 1, 2006, EMPLOYEES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN COULD CHOOSE TO DEFER IN EITHER AN INTEREST EARNING ACCOUNT OR A BOEING STOCK UNIT

ACCOUNT. EFFECTIVE MAY 1, 2006, PARTICIPANTS CAN DIVERSIFY DEFERRED COMPENSATION AMONG 19 INVESTMENT FUNDS INCLUDING THE INTEREST EARNING ACCOUNT AND THE BOEING STOCK UNIT ACCOUNT.

TOTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION WAS $210, $149, AND $26 IN 2006, 2005, AND 2004, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, FOR

EMPLOYEES WHO ELECTED TO DEFER THEIR COMPENSATION IN STOCK UNITS PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY MATCHED 25% OF THE DEFERRAL WITH ADDITIONAL STOCK UNITS. UPON RETIREMENT, THE 25% MATCH IS SETTLED IN CASH OR STOCK; HOWEVER, EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2006 ALL MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS ARE SETTLED IN STOCK. AS A RESULT, WE RECLASSIFIED $102 FROM OTHER LIABILITIES TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 RELATED TO THE 25% MATCHING CONTRIBUTION. THIS MODIFICATION

RESULTED IN NO INCREMENTAL COMPENSATION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITY WHICH IS BEING MARKED TO MARKET WAS $1,505 AND $1,348.

NOTE 17  SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

THE COMPANYS 2005 STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS TERMINATED BY RESOLUTION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON AUGUST 28, 2006 AND REPLACED WITH A PROGRAM

APPROVING THE REPURCHASE OF $3 BILLION OF ADDITIONAL COMMON STOCK (THE 2006 PROGRAM). UNLESS TERMINATED EARLIER BY RESOLUTION OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, THE 2006 PROGRAM WILL EXPIRE WHEN WE HAVE USED ALL FUNDS AUTHORIZED FOR REPURCHASE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 $2,374 IN SHARES MAY STILL BE PURCHASED UNDER THE PROGRAM.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, THERE WERE 1,200,000,000 COMMON SHARED AUTHORIZED. 20,000,000 SHARES OF AUTHORIZED PREFERRED STOCK REMAIN UNISSUED.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

OUR CASH FLOW HEDGES INCLUDE CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CROSS CURRENCY SWAPS,

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS AND COMMODITY PURCHASE CONTRACTS. INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS UNDER WHICH WE AGREE TO PAY FIXED RATES OF INTEREST ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF VARIABLE-RATE DEBT

OBLIGATIONS. WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MANAGE CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFICALLY SALES AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS MADE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HEDGE

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS PRINCIPALLY OCCURRING WITHIN FIVE YEARS IN THE FUTURE, WITH CERTAIN CONTRACTS HEDGING TRANSACTIONS UP TO 2021. WE USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS FIXED-PRICE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, TO HEDGE AGAINST POTENTIALLY UNFAVORABLE

PRICE CHANGES FOR ITEMS USED IN PRODUCTION. THESE INCLUDE COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE ELECTRICITY AT FIXED PRICES THROUGH 2009.

91

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005, AND 2004, GAINS/(LOSSES) OF $24, $3, AND ($16), RESPECTIVELY,

(NET OF TAX) WERE RECLASSIFIED TO COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS. IN 2006, ADDITIONAL GAINS OF $12 WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS TO OTHER INCOME, NET, AS A RESULT OF

DISCONTINUANCE OF CASH FLOW HEDGE DESIGNATION BASED ON THE PROBABILITY THAT THE ORIGINAL FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS WILL NOT OCCUR BY THE END OF THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD. SUCH RECLASSIFICATIONS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2005 AND 2004. INEFFECTIVENESS FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES WAS INSIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, NET GAINS OF $18 AND $32 (NET OF TAX) WERE RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CASH FLOW

HEDGING TRANSACTIONS. BASED ON OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO OF CASH FLOW HEDGES, WE EXPECT TO RECLASSIFY TO COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES A GAIN OF $21 (NET OF TAX) DURING 2007.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

INTEREST RATE SWAPS UNDER WHICH WE AGREE TO PAY VARIABLE RATES OF INTEREST ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE DEBT. THE NET CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF

THE DERIVATIVES AND THE HEDGED ITEMS IS REPORTED IN INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE. INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS INSIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004, $8, $12, AND $24 OF GAINS

RELATED TO THE BASIS ADJUSTMENT OF CERTAIN TERMINATED INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND FORWARD-STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS WERE AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECEIVING HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

WE ALSO HOLD CERTAIN NON-HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS INTEREST EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WARRANTS, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. THE

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2006, 2005 AND 2004, THESE NON-HEDGING INSTRUMENTS RESULTED IN NET (LOSS)/GAINS OF ($6), $11, AND $19, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 19  ARRANGEMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

WE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF

BUSINESS, AS DISCUSSED BELOW. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF GUARANTEES, PRODUCT WARRANTIES, AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES).

THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE DATA REGARDING OUR THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES. THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL PAYMENTS REPRESENT A WORST-CASE SCENARIO, AND DO NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT OUR EXPECTED

RESULTS. ESTIMATED PROCEEDS FROM COLLATERAL AND RECOURSE REPRESENT THE ANTICIPATED VALUES OF ASSETS WE COULD LIQUIDATE OR RECEIVE FROM OTHER PARTIES TO OFFSET OUR PAYMENTS UNDER GUARANTEES. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF LIABILITIES RECORDED ON THE

CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNING A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF NEW AIRCRAFT (SALE AIRCRAFT), WE HAVE ENTERED INTO

CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS. UNDER SUCH COMMITMENTS, WE AGREE TO REPURCHASE THE SALE AIRCRAFT AT A SPECIFIED PRICE, GENERALLY TEN YEARS AFTER DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT. OUR REPURCHASE OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT IS

CONTINGENT UPON A FUTURE, MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT.

INDEMNIFICATIONS TO ULA

WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ULA

AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT ULA MAY INCUR FROM CERTAIN CONTRACTS CONTRIBUTED BY US. IN THE EVENT ULA IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CONTRACT PRICING TO WHICH WE BELIEVE ULA IS ENTITLED, WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY SHORTFALL AND MAY

RECORD UP TO $322 IN PRE-TAX LOSSES. WE RECORDED A LIABILITY OF $7 AS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS INDEMNIFICATION. THE TERM OF THE INDEMNIFICATION IS INDEFINITE.

WE ENTERED INTO AN INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT WITH ULA FOR THE SALE OF $1,860 OF DELTA PROGRAM INVENTORIES WHICH WERE NOT CONTRIBUTED

TO THE JOINT VENTURE. THE TERM OF THE INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT EXTENDS TO MARCH 31, 2021. WE HAVE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ULA IN THE EVENT THAT THESE INVENTORIES ARE NOT RECOVERABLE FROM EXISTING AND FUTURE ORDERS. WE ALSO AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ULA

AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT ULA MAY INCUR RELATING TO THE RECOVERABILITY OF $1,375 OF INVENTORIES INCLUDED IN THE CONTRIBUTED ASSETS. THE TERM OF THE INVENTORY INDEMNIFICATION EXTENDS TO DECEMBER 31, 2020. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT THE $1,375

OF CONTRIBUTED INVENTORIES AND THE ADDITIONAL $1,860 OF BOEING DELTA INVENTORIES TO BE SOLD TO ULA WILL BE RECOVERABLE BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE MISSION MANIFEST, LOSSES COULD OCCUR IF THE MANIFEST IS REDUCED AND THE INVENTORIES ARE NOT

RECOVERED BY ULA.

RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES

WE HAVE ISSUED

VARIOUS RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES PRINCIPALLY TO FACILITATE THE SALE OF CERTAIN COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. UNDER THESE GUARANTEES, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO

THE GUARANTEED PARTY IF THE RELATED AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT FAIR VALUES FALL BELOW A SPECIFIED AMOUNT AT A FUTURE TIME. THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE COLLATERALIZED PRINCIPALLY

BY COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND EXPIRE IN 2 TO 12 YEARS.

CREDIT GUARANTEES

RELATED TO THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE

WE HAVE ISSUED CREDIT GUARANTEES TO CREDITORS OF THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE, OF WHICH WE ARE A 40% PARTNER, TO ASSIST THE VENTURE IN OBTAINING FINANCING. UNDER THESE CREDIT GUARANTEES, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE

PAYMENTS TO A GUARANTEED PARTY IN THE EVENT THAT SEA LAUNCH DOES NOT MAKE ITS LOAN PAYMENTS. WE HAVE SUBSTANTIVE GUARANTEES FROM THE OTHER VENTURE PARTNERS, WHO ARE OBLIGATED TO REIMBURSE US FOR THEIR SHARE (IN PROPORTION TO THEIR SEA LAUNCH

OTHER CREDIT GUARANTEES

WE HAVE ISSUED CREDIT GUARANTEES, PRINCIPALLY TO FACILITATE THE SALE OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ARE

OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO A GUARANTEED PARTY IN THE EVENT THAT LEASE OR LOAN PAYMENTS ARE NOT MADE BY THE ORIGINAL DEBTOR OR LESSEE. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THESE GUARANTEES HAS BEEN EXTENDED ON BEHALF OF ORIGINAL DEBTORS OR LESSEES WITH LESS

THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CREDIT-RELATED GUARANTEES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY THE UNDERLYING COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. CURRENT OUTSTANDING CREDIT GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHIN THE NEXT 9 YEARS.

OTHER INDEMNIFICATIONS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR SALES OF THE EDD AND ROCKETDYNE BUSINESSES AND THE SALE OF OUR COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANES FACILITIES IN WICHITA, KANSAS AND TULSA AND MCALESTER, OKLAHOMA IN 2005, WE PROVIDED INDEMNIFICATIONS TO THE BUYERS RELATING TO PRE-CLOSING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS. THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNIFICATIONS ARE

MATERIAL VARIABLE INTERESTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

OUR INVESTMENTS IN EETCS AND OTHER VIES ARE INCLUDED WITHIN THE SCOPE OF REVISED INTERPRETATION NO. 46 (FIN 46(R)), CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES. WE HAVE CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN EETCS WHICH WERE ACQUIRED BETWEEN 1999 AND 2005. EETCS ARE TRUSTS THAT PASSIVELY HOLD INVESTMENTS IN AIRCRAFT OR POOLS OF AIRCRAFT. THE EETCS PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH COLLATERAL POSITION IN THE RELATED ASSETS

AND TRANCHED RIGHTS TO CASH FLOWS FROM A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT. OUR INVESTMENTS IN EETCS DO NOT REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION UNDER FIN 46(R). AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 OUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO ECONOMIC LOSS FROM OUR EETCS IS $152. AT DECEMBER 31, 2006,

THE EETC INVESTMENTS HAD TOTAL ASSETS OF $559 AND TOTAL DEBT OF $407. THIS DEBT IS NON-RECOURSE TO US. DURING 2006, WE RECORDED INCOME OF $9 AND RECEIVED CASH OF $18 RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS.

INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS

INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS (IRBS) ISSUED BY THE CITY OF WICHITA ARE USED TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE AND/OR CONSTRUCTION OF REAL AND

PERSONAL PROPERTY AT OUR WICHITA SITE. TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH IRBS INCLUDE A TEN-YEAR PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT AND A SALES TAX EXEMPTION FROM THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE. WE RECORD THE PROPERTY ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

POSITION, ALONG WITH A CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION TO REPAY THE PROCEEDS OF THE IRB. WE HAVE ALSO PURCHASED THE IRBS AND THEREFORE ARE THE BONDHOLDER AS WELL AS THE BORROWER/LESSEE OF THE PROPERTY PURCHASED WITH THE IRB PROCEEDS.

WE HAVE A SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA

WHERE WE ARE BOTH BORROWER AND BONDHOLDER. TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE IRBS ARE THE PROVISION OF A TEN-YEAR PARTIAL PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT.

THE CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION AND IRB ASSET ARE RECORDED NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION PURSUANT TO FIN 39,

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 20  SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK

CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INVOLVING POTENTIAL CREDIT RISK ARE PREDOMINANTLY WITH COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. OF THE $14,175 IN ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE AND CUSTOMER FINANCING INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, $8,562 RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS ($358 OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND $8,204 OF CUSTOMER FINANCING) AND $2,832

RELATED TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. OF THE $8,204 OF AIRCRAFT CUSTOMER FINANCING, $7,712 RELATED TO CUSTOMERS WE BELIEVE HAVE LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. AIRTRAN AIRWAYS, AMR, UNITED AIRLINES AND MIDWEST AIRLINES INC. WERE ASSOCIATED WITH 19%,

14% 9% AND 8%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR AIRCRAFT FINANCING PORTFOLIO. FINANCING FOR AIRCRAFT IS COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITY IN THE RELATED ASSET. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THERE WAS $10,164 OF FINANCING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER

INCLUDING OPTIONS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 23, OF WHICH $8,356 RELATED TO CUSTOMERS WE BELIEVE HAVE LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT.

OTHER RISK

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, APPROXIMATELY 37% OF OUR EMPLOYEES WERE REPRESENTED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND APPROXIMATELY 4% OF EMPLOYEES WERE REPRESENTED BY AGREEMENTS EXPIRING DURING 2007.

NOTE 21  DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS AND NOTES RECEIVABLE BALANCES AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005 APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUE.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE WERE $5,285 AND $5,643, AND THE RELATED FAIR VALUES, BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RATES FOR LOANS OF THE SAME RISK AND MATURITIES, WERE ESTIMATED AT $4,876 AND

$5,356. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE BALANCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2005 APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUE. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR OTHER LIABILITIES BALANCE AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005

APPROXIMATES ITS CARRYING VALUE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005,

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF DEBT, NET OF CAPITAL LEASES, WAS $9,395 AND $10,516 AND THE FAIR VALUE OF DEBT, BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RATES FOR DEBT OF THE SAME RISK AND MATURITIES, WAS ESTIMATED AT $10,297 AND $11,643. OUR DEBT IS GENERALLY NOT CALLABLE

UNTIL MATURITY.

WITH REGARD TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE

SHEET RISK, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF FUTURE FINANCING COMMITMENTS BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A MARKET FOR SUCH FUTURE COMMITMENTS. RESIDUAL VALUE AND CREDIT GUARANTEES ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE A FAIR VALUE OF $113 AND $148 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005. CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE A FAIR VALUE OF $91 AND $80 AT DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005.

NOTE 22  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS, CONTRACTS AND OTHER MATTERS ARE PENDING AGAINST US. MANY POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO MATTERS COVERED

BY OUR INSURANCE. POTENTIAL MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, FROM WHICH CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT OR HAVE RESULTED. SUCH PROCEEDINGS INVOLVE, OR COULD INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES,

COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION AND/OR FORFEITURES. UNDER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, A COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS OPERATING DIVISIONS OR SUBDIVISIONS,

96

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CAN ALSO BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, OR LOSE ITS EXPORT PRIVILEGES, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS. WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON CURRENT

INFORMATION, THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH GOVERNMENT DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW.

A-12 LITIGATION

IN 1991, THE U.S. NAVY NOTIFIED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION (NOW ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES) AND GENERAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION (TOGETHER, THE TEAM) THAT IT WAS

TERMINATING FOR DEFAULT THE TEAMS CONTRACT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE A-12 AIRCRAFT. THE TEAM FILED A LEGAL ACTION TO CONTEST THE NAVYS DEFAULT TERMINATION, TO ASSERT ITS RIGHTS TO CONVERT THE TERMINATION TO ONE FOR

THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND TO OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COSTS INCURRED ON THE A-12 CONTRACT BUT NOT PAID TO DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, INVENTORIES INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $584 OF RECORDED COSTS ON THE A-12

CONTRACT, AGAINST WHICH WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LOSS PROVISION OF $350. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVISION, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1990, WAS BASED ON MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATIONS BELIEF, SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE

TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WOULD BE CONVERTED TO A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, AND THAT THE BEST ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE LOSS ON TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE WAS $350.

ON AUGUST 31, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ISSUED A DECISION AFTER TRIAL UPHOLDING THE GOVERNMENTS DEFAULT

TERMINATION OF THE A-12 CONTRACT. THE COURT DID NOT, HOWEVER, ENTER A MONEY JUDGMENT FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ON ITS CLAIM FOR UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS. IN 2003, THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT, FINDING THAT THE TRIAL COURT HAD

APPLIED THE WRONG LEGAL STANDARD, VACATED THE TRIAL COURTS 2001 DECISION AND ORDERED THE CASE SENT BACK TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. THIS FOLLOWS AN EARLIER TRIAL COURT DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE TEAM AND REVERSAL OF THAT INITIAL

DECISION ON APPEAL.

IF, AFTER ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS HAVE ENDED, THE

COURTS DETERMINE, CONTRARY TO OUR BELIEF, THAT A TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WAS APPROPRIATE, WE WOULD INCUR AN ADDITIONAL LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $275, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF REMAINING INVENTORY COSTS AND ADJUSTMENTS, AND, IF THE COURTS FURTHER HOLD

THAT A MONEY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE ENTERED AGAINST THE TEAM, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ONE-HALF OF THE UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS OF $1,350 PLUS STATUTORY INTEREST FROM FEBRUARY 1991 (CURRENTLY TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $1,270).

IN THAT EVENT, OUR LOSS WOULD TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $1,585 IN PRE-TAX CHARGES. SHOULD, HOWEVER, THE MARCH 31, 1998 JUDGMENT OF THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS IN FAVOR OF THE TEAM BE REINSTATED, WE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PAYMENT OF

APPROXIMATELY $1,056, INCLUDING INTEREST.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE

TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT IS CONTRARY TO LAW AND FACT AND THAT THE LOSS PROVISION ESTABLISHED BY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION IN 1990, WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION FROM OUTSIDE COUNSEL, CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE

REDUCTION IN VALUE OF A-12 NET CONTRACTS IN PROCESS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006. FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE A-12 LITIGATION WILL DEPEND UPON THE OUTCOME OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS OR POSSIBLE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

GLOBAL SETTLEMENT OF THE EVOLVED EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE (EELV) AND DRUYUN MATTERS

ON JUNE 30, 2006, WE ENTERED INTO A GLOBAL SETTLEMENT THROUGH TWO SEPARATE

AGREEMENTS DISPOSING OF POTENTIAL CRIMINAL CHARGES AND CIVIL CLAIMS WITH THE CIVIL DIVISION OF THE U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT AND U.S. ATTORNEYS IN LOS ANGELES, CA AND ALEXANDRIA, VA RELATING TO TWO SEPARATE PROCUREMENT INTEGRITY INCIDENTS. THE FIRST

INCIDENT IN 1999, INVOLVED POSSESSION BY FOUR BOEING EMPLOYEES OF LOCKHEED MARTIN COMPETITOR INFORMATION RELATED TO THE EELV PROGRAM. THE SECOND INCIDENT RELATED TO CONFLICT OF INTEREST CHARGES IN HIRING FORMER GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL DARLEEN DRUYUN. IN

THE AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. ATTORNEYS IN LOS ANGELES AND ALEXANDRIA WE AGREED TO PAY A $50 PENALTY, COMMITTED TO MAINTAINING OUR STRENGTHENED ETHICS AND COMPLIANCE PROGRAM FOR THE TWO-YEAR TERM OF THE AGREEMENT (THROUGH JUNE

97

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2008) AND AGREED TO PROVIDE BOTH U.S. ATTORNEY OFFICES WITH CERTAIN COMPLIANCE REPORTS. CONCURRENT WITH ENTERING INTO THE U.S. ATTORNEY AGREEMENT, WE ENTERED INTO A

CIVIL AGREEMENT WITH THE CIVIL DIVISION OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE UNDER WHICH WE AGREED TO PAY $565 IN SETTLEMENT OF ALL POTENTIAL CIVIL CLAIMS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO AN ADMINISTRATIVE AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. AIR FORCE THROUGH MARCH 2008

WHICH REQUIRES CERTAIN COMPLIANCE ACTIVITIES AND REPORTS.

AS A RESULT OF

THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT, WE HAVE RECORDED AN ADDITIONAL EXPENSE OF $571, WHICH REPRESENTS THE CUMULATIVE PAYMENT OF $615 UNDER THE TWO SEPARATE AGREEMENTS, NET OF $44 PREVIOUSLY ACCRUED IN CONNECTION WITH PROGRAM AND CONTRACTS ISSUES RELATING TO THE

EELV INVESTIGATION.

ONE ADDITIONAL PROCEEDING THAT RELATES TO THE

SUBJECT MATTER OF THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT IS LOCKHEEDS JUNE 2003 LAWSUIT AGAINST US IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA BASED UPON THE EELV INCIDENT WHEREIN LOCKHEED SOUGHT INJUNCTIVE RELIEF, COMPENSATORY DAMAGES IN

EXCESS OF $2,000, AND TREBLE DAMAGES AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES, AND WE FILED COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST LOCKHEED SIMILARLY SEEKING COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. PROCEEDINGS IN THAT LAWSUIT HAD BEEN STAYED AT THE REQUEST OF THE PARTIES PENDING CLOSURE OF

UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE. ON DECEMBER 13, 2006, THE COURT, UPON A MOTION FROM THE PARTIES, ORDERED A DISMISSAL WITH PREJUDICE OF ALL CLAIMS AND COUNTERCLAIMS.

EMPLOYMENT AND BENEFITS LITIGATION

WE ARE A DEFENDANT IN THREE EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION CLASS ACTIONS. IN THE WILLIAMS CLASS ACTION, WHICH WAS FILED ON JUNE 8, 1998 IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON (ALLEGING RACE DISCRIMINATION), WE PREVAILED IN A JURY TRIAL IN DECEMBER 2005, BUT PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE PRE-TRIAL DISMISSAL OF COMPENSATION CLAIMS IN NOVEMBER 2005. IN THE CALENDER CLASS ACTION, WHICH WAS

FILED JANUARY 25, 2005 IN THE U.S. NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS (A SPIN-OFF FROM WILLIAMS ALLEGING RACE DISCRIMINATION), PLAINTIFFS DROPPED THEIR PROMOTIONS CLAIM ON JUNE 6, 2006 AND PUT THEIR COMPENSATION CLAIMS ON HOLD PENDING THE

OUTCOME OF THE WILLIAMS APPEAL. IN THE ANDERSON CLASS ACTION, WHICH WAS FILED MARCH 22, 2002 IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF OKLAHOMA (ALLEGING GENDER DISCRIMINATION), THE CLASS CLAIMS WERE DISMISSED ON OCTOBER 18, 2006,

AND NO APPEAL WAS TAKEN.

IN ADDITION, ON MARCH 2, 2006, WE WERE

SERVED WITH A COMPLAINT FILED IN THE U. S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS, ALLEGING THAT HIRING DECISIONS MADE BY SPIRIT AEROSPACE NEAR THE TIME OF BOEINGS SALE OF THE WICHITA FACILITY WERE TAINTED BY AGE DISCRIMINATION. THE CASE IS

BROUGHT AS A CLASS ACTION ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUALS NOT HIRED BY SPIRIT. PURSUANT TO AN INDEMNITY PROVISION IN THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT, SPIRIT HAS AGREED TO DEFEND AND INDEMNIFY US.

ON JUNE 23, 2006, TWO EMPLOYEES AND TWO FORMER EMPLOYEES OF BOEING FILED A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS AGAINST BOEING, MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION AND THE PENSION VALUE PLAN FOR EMPLOYEES OF THE BOEING COMPANY (THE PLAN) ON BEHALF OF THEMSELVES AND SIMILARLY SITUATED PARTICIPANTS IN THE PLAN.

THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT AS OF JANUARY 1, 1999 AND ALL TIMES THEREAFTER, THE PLANS BENEFIT FORMULA USED TO COMPUTE THE ACCRUED BENEFIT VIOLATES THE ACCRUAL RULES OF EMPLOYMENT RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT AND THAT PLAINTIFFS ARE

ENTITLED TO A RECALCULATION OF THEIR BENEFITS ALONG WITH OTHER EQUITABLE RELIEF. WE BELIEVE THE ALLEGATIONS CLAIMED BY PLAINTIFFS LACK MERIT AND HAVE FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS ALL CLAIMS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN

ADVERSE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2006, TWO UAW LOCAL 1069 RETIREES FILED A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE ALLEGING THAT RECENTLY ANNOUNCED CHANGES TO MEDICAL PLANS FOR RETIREES OF UAW LOCAL 1069 CONSTITUTED A BREACH

OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS UNDER §301 OF THE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS ACT AND §502(A)(1)(B) OF ERISA. ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2006, BOEING FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS AGAINST THE INTERNATIONAL UAW AND

TWO RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN PARTICIPANTS SEEKING A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT CONFIRMING THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE CHANGES TO

98

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THESE MEDICAL BENEFITS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN ADVERSE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

ON OCTOBER 13, 2006, WE WERE NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN A LAWSUIT

FILED IN THE U. S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS. PLAINTIFFS, SEEKING TO REPRESENT A CLASS OF SIMILARLY SITUATED PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES IN THE BOEING COMPANY VOLUNTARY INVESTMENT PLAN (THE PLAN), ALLEGE

THAT FEES AND EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE PLAN WERE AND ARE UNREASONABLE AND EXCESSIVE, NOT INCURRED SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PLAN AND ITS PARTICIPANTS, AND UNDISCLOSED TO PARTICIPANTS. THE PLAINTIFFS FURTHER ALLEGE THAT DEFENDANTS BREACHED THEIR

FIDUCIARY DUTIES IN VIOLATION OF SECTION 502(A)(2) OF ERISA, AND SEEK INJUNCTIVE AND EQUITABLE RELIEF PURSUANT TO SECTION 502(A)(3) OF ERISA. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE AT THIS TIME WHETHER AN ADVERSE OUTCOME IN THIS MATTER WOULD HAVE

A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

BSSI/ICO LITIGATION

ON AUGUST 16, 2004, BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL,

INC. (BSSI) FILED A COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AGAINST ICO GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS (OPERATIONS), LTD. (ICO) IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. BSSIS SUIT SEEKS A DECLARATION THAT ICOS PRIOR TERMINATION OF TWO CONTRACTS FOR

CONVENIENCE EXTINGUISHED ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2004, ICO FILED A CROSS

-

COMPLAINT ALLEGING BREACH OF CONTRACT, AND OTHER CLAIMS, AND SEEKING RECOVERY OF ALL AMOUNTS PAID TO BSSI UNDER THE CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE

ALLEGED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $2,000; ICO ADDED BOEING TO THE SUIT AS A DEFENDANT APPROXIMATELY ONE YEAR LATER. ON JANUARY 13, 2006, BSSI FILED A CROSS-COMPLAINT AGAINST ICO, ICO GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS (HOLDINGS) LIMITED (ICO

HOLDINGS), ICOS PARENT, AND EAGLE RIVER INVESTMENTS, LLC, PARENT OF BOTH ICO AND ICO HOLDINGS, ALLEGING FRAUD AND OTHER CLAIMS. TRIAL HAS BEEN SET FOR SEPTEMBER 2007. WE BELIEVE THAT ICOS CLAIMS LACK MERIT AND INTEND TO

AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE OUR CLAIMS.

BSSI/THURAYA LITIGATION

ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2004, A GROUP OF INSURANCE UNDERWRITERS FOR THURAYA SATELLITE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS (THURAYA) REQUESTED ARBITRATION BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC) AGAINST BSSI. THE REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION ALLEGES THAT BSSI BREACHED ITS CONTRACT WITH THURAYA FOR SALE OF A MODEL 702 SATELLITE THAT EXPERIENCED

POWER LOSS ANOMALIES. THE CLAIMANTS SEEK APPROXIMATELY $199 (PLUS CLAIMS OF INTEREST, COSTS AND FEES) CONSISTING OF INSURANCE PAYMENTS MADE TO THURAYA, AND THEY FURTHER RESERVED THE RIGHT TO SEEK AN ADDITIONAL $38 CURRENTLY IN DISPUTE BETWEEN

THURAYA AND SOME INSURERS. THURAYA HAS RESERVED ITS RIGHTS TO SEEK UNINSURED LOSSES THAT COULD INCREASE THE TOTAL AMOUNT DISPUTED TO $365. WE BELIEVE THESE CLAIMS LACK MERIT AND INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM.

WE HAVE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO RESPOND TO THIS ARBITRATION REQUEST AND HAVE NOTIFIED

RESPONSIBLE INSURERS. ON MAY 26, 2006, A GROUP OF THESE INSURERS FILED A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY ASSERTING CERTAIN DEFENSES TO COVERAGE AND REQUESTING A DECLARATION OF THEIR OBLIGATION UNDER BOEINGS

INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE POLICIES RELATING TO THE THURAYA ICC ARBITRATION. WE BELIEVE THE INSURERS POSITION LACKS MERIT AND INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY LITIGATE THE COVERAGE ISSUE.

BSSI/TELESAT CANADA

ON NOVEMBER 9, 2006, TELESAT CANADA AND ITS INSURERS SERVED BSSI WITH AN ARBITRATION DEMAND ALLEGING BREACH OF CONTRACT, GROSS NEGLIGENCE, AND WILLFUL

MISCONDUCT IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSTRUCTIVE TOTAL LOSS OF ANIK F1, A MODEL 702 SATELLITE MANUFACTURED BY BSSI. TELESAT AND ITS INSURERS SEEK OVER $385 IN DAMAGES AND $10 IN LOST PROFITS. ON DECEMBER 1, 2006, WE FILED AN ACTION IN THE ONTARIO

SUPERIOR COURT OF JUSTICE, OTTAWA, CANADA, TO ENJOIN THE ARBITRATION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CLAIMS ASSERTED BY TELESAT AND ITS INSURERS LACK MERIT, BUT WE HAVE NOTIFIED OUR INSURANCE CARRIERS OF THE DEMAND.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BSSI/SUPERBIRD-6 LITIGATION

ON DECEMBER 1, 2006, BSSI WAS SERVED WITH AN ARBITRATION DEMAND IN SUBROGATION BROUGHT BY INSURERS FOR SPACE COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION ALLEGING BREACH OF

WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND GROSS NEGLIGENCE RELATING TO THE SUPERBIRD-6 COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE, WHICH SUFFERED A LOW PERIGEE EVENT SHORTLY AFTER LAUNCH IN APRIL 2004. THE LOW ORBIT ALLEGEDLY DAMAGED THE SATELLITE, AND A SUBSEQUENT DECISION

TO DE-ORBIT THE SATELLITE WAS MADE LESS THAN 12 MONTHS AFTER LAUNCH. THE MODEL 601 SATELLITE WAS MANUFACTURED BY BSSI AND DELIVERED FOR LAUNCH BY INTERNATIONAL LAUNCH SERVICES ON AN ATLAS LAUNCH VEHICLE. THE INSURERS SEEK TO RECOVER IN EXCESS OF

$215 FROM BSSI. WE BELIEVE THE INSURERS CLAIMS LACK MERIT AND INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM.

NOTE 23  OTHER COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005 WE HAD $86,254 AND $58,532 OF PRODUCTION RELATED PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. SUCH OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE AGREEMENTS FOR PRODUCTION GOODS, TOOLING

COSTS, ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS CONTRACTS, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS PRODUCTION RELATED OBLIGATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE AMOUNTS OF PRODUCTION RELATED PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS FOR EACH OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WERE AS FOLLOWS: $34,926 IN 2007, $20,988 IN 2008, $14,088 IN 2009, $7,817 IN 2010, AND $4,123 IN 2011.

FINANCING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER, INCLUDING OPTIONS, TOTALED $10,164 AND $13,496 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005. WE ANTICIPATE THAT NOT ALL

OF THESE COMMITMENTS WILL BE UTILIZED AND THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ARRANGE FOR THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS TO ASSUME A PORTION OF THE REMAINING COMMITMENTS, IF NECESSARY.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNING A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF NEW AIRCRAFT (SALE AIRCRAFT), WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SPECIFIED-PRICE

TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO TRADE IN THEIR USED AIRCRAFT FOR THE PURCHASE OF SALE AIRCRAFT. THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN VALUE WAS $1,162 AND $1,395 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005. BASED ON THE

BEST MARKET INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, IT WAS PROBABLE THAT WE WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO PERFORM ON TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WITH NET AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO CUSTOMERS TOTALING $19 AND $72 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE

OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT RELATED TO PROBABLE CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WAS $19 AND $50 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005. PROBABLE LOSSES OF $22 HAVE BEEN CHARGED TO COST OF PRODUCTS AND WERE INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2005. THESE TRADE-IN COMMITMENT AGREEMENTS HAVE EXPIRATION DATES FROM 2008 THROUGH 2015.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, FUTURE LEASE COMMITMENTS ON AIRCRAFT AND OTHER COMMITMENTS NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION TOTALED $323 AND $371. THESE LEASE

COMMITMENTS EXTEND THROUGH 2020. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, THE FUTURE LEASE COMMITMENTS ON AIRCRAFT FOR EACH OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WERE AS FOLLOWS: $44 IN 2007, $47 IN 2008, $25 IN 2009, $20 IN 2010, AND $18 IN 2011. OUR INTENT IS TO RECOVER

THESE LEASE COMMITMENTS THROUGH SUBLEASE ARRANGEMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDED $65 AND $76 ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADVERSE COMMITMENTS UNDER THESE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS.

WE AND LOCKHEED HAVE AGREED TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO ULA A LINE OF CREDIT IN THE AMOUNT OF

UP TO $200 EACH AS MAY BE NECESSARY FROM TIME TO TIME TO SUPPORT ULAS EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE BUSINESS DURING THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD FOLLOWING DECEMBER 1, 2006. ULA DID NOT REQUEST ANY FUNDS UNDER THE LINE OF CREDIT AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006.

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION INSURED ITS

EXECUTIVES WITH COMPANY OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (COLI), WHICH ARE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES WITH A CASH SURRENDER VALUE. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT USE COLI CURRENTLY, THESE OBLIGATIONS FROM THE MERGER WITH MCDONNELL DOUGLAS ARE STILL A COMMITMENT AT THIS TIME.

WE HAVE

100

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LOANS IN PLACE TO COVER COSTS PAID OR INCURRED TO CARRY THE UNDERLYING LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE WAS

$288 AND $259 AND THE TOTAL LOANS WERE $279 AND $252. AS WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO OFFSET THE LOANS AGAINST THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF THE POLICIES, WE PRESENT THE NET ASSET IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005.

THE COSTS INCURRED AND EXPECTED TO BE

INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT HAD, AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. WITH RESPECT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, RELATED CHARGES HAVE AVERAGED LESS THAN 1% OF HISTORICAL ANNUAL

REVENUES. ALTHOUGH NOT CONSIDERED PROBABLE OR REASONABLY ESTIMABLE AT THIS TIME, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL REMEDIATION CHARGES BECAUSE OF REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES AND THE RISK OF UNIDENTIFIED CONTAMINATION. ALTHOUGH NOT

CONSIDERED PROBABLE, SHOULD WE INCUR REMEDIATION CHARGES AT THE HIGH LEVEL OF THE RANGE OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURE, THE ADDITIONAL CHARGES WOULD BE LESS THAN 2% OF HISTORICAL ANNUAL REVENUES.

AS PART OF THE 2004 PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION RELATED TO THE SALE OF BCCS COMMERCIAL

FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS, WE ARE INVOLVED IN A LOSS SHARING ARRANGEMENT FOR LOSSES THAT MAY EXIST AT THE END OF THE INITIAL FINANCING TERMS OF TRANSFERRED PORTFOLIO ASSETS, OR, IN SOME INSTANCES, PRIOR TO THE END OF THE FINANCING TERM, SUCH AS

CERTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REPOSSESSION. THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOSS SHARING ARRANGEMENT IS $218. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, THE ACCRUED LIABILITY UNDER THE LOSS SHARING ARRANGEMENT WAS $78 AND $81.

DUE TO LACK OF DEMAND FOR THE 717 AND 757 AIRPLANES, WE HAVE CONCLUDED

PRODUCTION OF THESE AIRPLANES. THE LAST 717 AND 757 AIRPLANES WERE DELIVERED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 AND 2005 RESPECTIVELY. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES THE TERMINATION LIABILITY REMAINING IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES.

REPRESENTS TRANSFER TO PREPAID PENSION EXPENSE

THE ABOVE LIABILITY WAS DETERMINED BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND WE MAKE REVISIONS TO OUR ESTIMATES ACCORDINGLY AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

THE BOEING-BUILT NSS-8 SATELLITE WAS DECLARED A TOTAL LOSS

DUE TO AN ANOMALY DURING LAUNCH ON JANUARY 30, 2007. THE NSS-8 SATELLITE WAS INSURED FOR $200. WE BELIEVE THE NSS-8 LOSS WAS THE RESULT OF AN INSURED EVENT AND HAVE SO NOTIFIED OUR INSURANCE CARRIERS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 WE HAVE DELIVERED 159 OF THE 190 C-17S ORDERED BY THE

USAF, WITH FINAL DELIVERIES SCHEDULED FOR 2009. DESPITE PENDING ORDERS, WHICH WOULD EXTEND DELIVERIES OF THE C-17 TO MID-2009, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL DECIDE IN 2007 TO SUSPEND WORK ON LONG-LEAD ITEMS FROM SUPPLIERS AND/OR TO COMPLETE

PRODUCTION OF THE C-17 IF FURTHER ORDERS ARE NOT RECEIVED. WE ARE STILL EVALUATING THE FULL FINANCIAL IMPACT OF A PRODUCTION SHUT-DOWN, INCLUDING ANY RECOVERY THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT.

2. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, SUCH CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE BOEING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006 AND 2005, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND SHAREHOLDERS OF

THE BOEING COMPANY

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

WE HAVE AUDITED MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, THAT THE BOEING

COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE

COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND AN OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR

AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES

AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE

MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION

OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND
