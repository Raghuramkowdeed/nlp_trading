FINANCIAL AND OTHER BUSINESS INFORMATION

SEE THE SUMMARY OF

BUSINESS SEGMENT DATA AND NOTE 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING REVENUES AND EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS, FOR EACH OF THE MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

WE OWN NUMEROUS PATENTS AND HAVE

LICENSES FOR THE USE OF PATENTS OWNED BY OTHERS, WHICH RELATE TO OUR PRODUCTS AND THEIR MANUFACTURE. IN ADDITION TO OWNING A LARGE PORTFOLIO OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WE ALSO LICENSE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO AND FROM THIRD PARTIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS LICENSES IN OUR PATENTS THAT ARE DEVELOPED IN PERFORMANCE OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, AND IT MAY USE OR AUTHORIZE OTHERS TO USE THE INVENTIONS COVERED BY SUCH PATENTS FOR GOVERNMENT PURPOSES. UNPATENTED RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND

ENGINEERING SKILLS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, ALSO MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO OUR BUSINESS. WHILE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

2

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RIGHTS IN THE AGGREGATE ARE IMPORTANT TO THE OPERATION OF EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY THE EXPIRATION OF ANY PARTICULAR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS OR TERMINATION OF ANY PARTICULAR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PATENT LICENSE AGREEMENTS.

NON-U.S. SALES

SEE NOTE 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING NON-U.S. SALES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES INVOLVE EXPERIMENTATION, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT

AND RELATED TEST ACTIVITIES FOR DEFENSE SYSTEMS, NEW AND DERIVATIVE JET AIRCRAFT INCLUDING BOTH COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY, ADVANCE SPACE AND OTHER COMPANY-SPONSORED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THESE ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED INCLUDING AMOUNTS ALLOCABLE AS

REIMBURSABLE OVERHEAD COSTS ON U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

OUR TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AMOUNTED TO $6.5 BILLION, $3.8 BILLION AND $3.9

BILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE NET OF 787-RELATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COST SHARING PAYMENTS FROM SUPPLIERS OF $0, $50 MILLION AND $130 MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE IN 2009 INCLUDES $2.7 BILLION OF PRODUCTION COSTS RELATED TO THE FIRST THREE FLIGHT TEST 787 AIRCRAFT THAT CANNOT BE SOLD DUE TO THE INORDINATE AMOUNT OF REWORK AND UNIQUE AND EXTENSIVE MODIFICATIONS MADE TO THE AIRCRAFT.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ALSO INCLUDE BID AND PROPOSAL EFFORTS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS COSTS INCURRED IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS

ESTIMATED TO BE RECOVERABLE UNDER COST-SHARING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS. BID AND PROPOSAL COSTS WERE $343 MILLION, $330 MILLION AND $306 MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITION

THE

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT MARKET AND THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REMAIN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE FACE AGGRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS, INCLUDING AIRBUS, WHO ARE INTENT ON INCREASING THEIR MARKET SHARE. WE ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OUR PROCESSES AND

CONTINUING COST REDUCTION EFFORTS. WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE OUR EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES NETWORK WHICH INCLUDES AVIATION SUPPORT, SPARES, TRAINING, MAINTENANCE DOCUMENTS AND TECHNICAL ADVICE FOR AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO PROVIDE A

HIGHER LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND PRODUCTIVITY.

BDS FACES STRONG COMPETITION IN ALL MARKET SEGMENTS, PRIMARILY FROM LOCKHEED MARTIN

CORPORATION, NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION, RAYTHEON COMPANY AND GENERAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION. NON-U.S. COMPANIES SUCH AS BAE SYSTEMS AND EUROPEAN AERONAUTIC DEFENCE AND SPACE COMPANY (EADS), THE PARENT OF AIRBUS, CONTINUE TO PURSUE A STRATEGIC

PRESENCE IN THE U.S. MARKET BY STRENGTHENING THEIR NORTH AMERICAN OPERATIONS AND PARTNERING WITH U.S. DEFENSE COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE OCCASIONALLY FORMED TEAMS WITH OTHER COMPETITORS TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC CUSTOMER

REQUIREMENTS. BDS EXPECTS THE TREND OF STRONG COMPETITION TO CONTINUE INTO 2010 WITH MANY INTERNATIONAL FIRMS PURSUING ANNOUNCED INTENTIONS OF INCREASING THEIR U.S. PRESENCE.

REGULATORY MATTERS

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED IN MOST OF OUR MARKETS. WE DEAL WITH NUMEROUS U.S.

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND ENTITIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALL OF THE BRANCHES OF THE U.S. MILITARY, NASA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. SIMILAR GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES EXIST IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS, MAY TERMINATE ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AT THEIR CONVENIENCE AS WELL AS FOR

DEFAULT BASED ON OUR FAILURE TO MEET SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS. IF ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WERE TO BE TERMINATED FOR CONVENIENCE, WE GENERALLY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PAYMENT FOR WORK COMPLETED AND ALLOWABLE TERMINATION OR

CANCELLATION COSTS. IF ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WERE TO BE TERMINATED FOR DEFAULT, GENERALLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD PAY ONLY FOR THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AND CAN REQUIRE US TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT PRICE

AND THE COST TO RE-PROCURE THE CONTRACT ITEMS, NET OF THE WORK ACCEPTED FROM THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN ALSO HOLD US LIABLE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE DEFAULT.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.

IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS GOVERNING PRODUCTION AND QUALITY SYSTEMS, AIRWORTHINESS AND

INSTALLATION APPROVALS, REPAIR PROCEDURES AND CONTINUING OPERATIONAL SAFETY. INTERNATIONALLY, SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS EXIST FOR AIRWORTHINESS, INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONAL APPROVALS. THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE GENERALLY ADMINISTERED BY THE NATIONAL

AVIATION AUTHORITIES OF EACH COUNTRY AND, IN THE CASE OF EUROPE, COORDINATED BY THE EUROPEAN JOINT AVIATION AUTHORITIES.

ENVIRONMENTAL.

OUR

OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO AND AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE DISCHARGE, TREATMENT, STORAGE, DISPOSAL, INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION OF CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUBSTANCES AND

WASTES. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OUR COMPLIANCE STATUS AND MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS TO ENSURE OUR OPERATIONS ARE IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF SITES ARE A NORMAL, RECURRING PART OF OUR OPERATIONS. THESE COSTS OFTEN ARE

ALLOWABLE COSTS UNDER OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CONTINUED ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR CASH FLOWS IF MORE STRINGENT CLEAN-UP

STANDARDS ARE IMPOSED, ADDITIONAL CONTAMINATION IS DISCOVERED AND/OR CLEAN-UP COSTS ARE HIGHER THAN ESTIMATED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY (PRP) HAS JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY UNDER EXISTING U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WHERE WE

HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED A PRP BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY OR A STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY, WE ARE POTENTIALLY LIABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT OR THIRD PARTIES FOR THE FULL COST OF REMEDIATING CONTAMINATION AT OUR FACILITIES OR FORMER FACILITIES OR

AT THIRD-PARTY SITES. IF WE WERE REQUIRED TO FULLY FUND THE REMEDIATION OF A SITE, THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK WOULD ALLOW US TO PURSUE RIGHTS TO CONTRIBUTION FROM OTHER PRPS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES, SEE NOTE

11 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNATIONAL.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS

AND PROCUREMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES, INCLUDING REGULATIONS RELATING TO IMPORT-EXPORT CONTROL, INVESTMENT, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. INTERNATIONAL SALES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO VARYING CURRENCY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS.

RAW MATERIALS

WE ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE

AVAILABILITY OF ESSENTIAL MATERIALS, PARTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS. THE MOST IMPORTANT RAW MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR OUR AEROSPACE PRODUCTS ARE ALUMINUM (SHEET, PLATE, FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS), TITANIUM (SHEET, PLATE,

FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS) AND COMPOSITES (INCLUDING CARBON AND BORON). ALTHOUGH ALTERNATIVE SOURCES GENERALLY EXIST FOR THESE RAW MATERIALS, QUALIFICATION OF THE SOURCES COULD TAKE A YEAR OR MORE. MANY MAJOR COMPONENTS AND PRODUCT EQUIPMENT ITEMS ARE

PROCURED OR SUBCONTRACTED ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS WITH A NUMBER OF COMPANIES.

SUPPLIERS

WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY OF A LARGE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO MEET PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS, QUALITY STANDARDS AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES AT

ANTICIPATED COSTS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN AN EXTENSIVE QUALIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO CONTROL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES, FAILURE OF SUPPLIERS OR SUBCONTRACTORS TO MEET COMMITMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AND PROGRAM/CONTRACT PROFITABILITY, THEREBY JEOPARDIZING OUR ABILITY TO FULFILL COMMITMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ARE ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY SOURCES, SUCH AS ELECTRICITY, AT AFFORDABLE PRICES. A NUMBER OF

OUR SUPPLIERS HAVE MADE ASSERTIONS FOR HIGHER PRICES OR OTHER CONTRACTUAL COMPENSATION RELIEF WHICH COULD AFFECT PROGRAM/CONTRACT PROFITABILITY.

SEASONALITY

NO MATERIAL PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS CONSIDERED TO BE SEASONAL.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THIS REPORT, AS WELL AS OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, QUARTERLY REPORTS, PRESS RELEASES AND OTHER WRITTEN AND ORAL COMMUNICATIONS, CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE

PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. WORDS SUCH AS MAY, WILL, SHOULD, EXPECTS, INTENDS, PROJECTS, BELIEVES, ESTIMATES, TARGETS,

ANTICIPATES AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE ANY STATEMENT THAT DOES NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO ANY HISTORICAL OR CURRENT FACT.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH MAY NOT PROVE TO BE ACCURATE. THESE STATEMENTS ARE NOT GUARANTEES AND ARE

SUBJECT TO RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE SET FORTH IN THE RISK FACTORS SECTION BELOW, COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY FROM

THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT HEREIN SPEAKS ONLY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH IT IS MADE, AND WE ASSUME NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

AN

INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK OR DEBT SECURITIES INVOLVES RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND OUR ACTUAL RESULTS AND FUTURE TRENDS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR PAST PERFORMANCE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE FOLLOWING.

WE DEPEND HEAVILY UPON COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS, OUR SUPPLIERS AND THE WORLDWIDE MARKET, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS.

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINES, SOME OF WHICH HAVE

ENCOUNTERED FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES.

WE CAN MAKE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY CUSTOMER WILL PURCHASE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM US AFTER OUR CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER ENDS. IN ADDITION, FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCY, OF ANY OF

THE MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES, EVEN UNDER EXISTING CONTRACTS, AND LIMIT OUR OPPORTUNITY TO GENERATE PROFITS FROM THOSE CUSTOMERS. SEVERAL COMMERCIAL AIRLINES, INCLUDING CERTAIN OF OUR CUSTOMERS, HAVE FILED FOR

OR EMERGED FROM BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION.

OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER AIRCRAFT ON TIME DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO

UNIQUE RISKS.

OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER JET AIRCRAFT ON SCHEDULE IS DEPENDENT UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXECUTION OF INTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS, AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS (SUCH AS ALUMINUM, TITANIUM AND COMPOSITES) AND INTERNALLY AND

SUPPLIER PRODUCED PARTS AND STRUCTURES, CONVERSION OF RAW MATERIALS INTO PARTS AND ASSEMBLIES, PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS AND REGULATORY CERTIFICATION. THE FAILURE OF ANY OR ALL OF THESE FACTORS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

OUT-OF-SEQUENCE WORK AND DISRUPTED PROCESS FLOWS ADVERSELY AFFECT PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AND PROGRAM/CONTRACT PROFITABILITY, THE LATTER THROUGH INCREASED COSTS AS WELL AS POSSIBLE CUSTOMER AND/OR SUPPLIER CLAIMS OR ASSERTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE

INTRODUCTION OF NEW COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND MAJOR DERIVATIVE AIRCRAFT INVOLVES INCREASED RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND CERTIFICATION SCHEDULES. FOR EXAMPLE, RECENT MODIFICATIONS REQUIRED ON THE SIDE-OF-BODY

SECTION OF OUR 787 AIRCRAFT HAVE RESULTED IN TESTING AND DELIVERY DELAYS.

MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY

TO SELL AIRCRAFT INTO THE FUTURE.

THE WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT IS PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY LONG-TERM TRENDS IN AIRLINE PASSENGER AND CARGO TRAFFIC. THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS UNDERLYING LONG-TERM TRAFFIC GROWTH ARE SUSTAINED

ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICAL STABILITY, BOTH IN DEVELOPED AND EMERGING COUNTRIES. DEMAND FOR OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS FURTHER INFLUENCED BY AIRLINE INDUSTRY PROFITABILITY, WORLD TRADE POLICIES, GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, TERRORISM,

DISEASE OUTBREAKS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED UPON AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND PRICE AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS MAY REQUEST TO CANCEL, MODIFY OR RESCHEDULE ORDERS.

WE

GENERALLY MAKE SALES UNDER AIRCRAFT PURCHASE AGREEMENTS THAT MAY, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, BECOME THE SUBJECT OF CANCELLATION, MODIFICATION OR RESCHEDULING. CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY AND

OUR CUSTOMERS COULD RESULT IN CUSTOMER REQUESTS TO RESCHEDULE OR CANCEL CONTRACTUAL ORDERS. OUR CONTRACTS HAVE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS RELATING TO SCHEDULE AND PERFORMANCE AND FAILURE TO DELIVER AIRPLANES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SUCH PROVISIONS COULD RESULT

IN CANCELLATIONS AND/OR CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION. ANY SUCH CANCELLATIONS, MODIFICATION, RESCHEDULING OR CLAIMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR BACKLOG, REVENUES, PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS.

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION RATES COULD CHANGE.

PRODUCTION RATE REDUCTIONS COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR DISRUPTION AND OTHER COSTS AND RESULT

IN INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS BEING ALLOCATED TO A SMALLER QUANTITY OF AIRPLANES, ALL OF WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY. THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW AIRCRAFT PROGRAM AND/OR HIGHER ORDERS FOR OUR AIRCRAFT COULD LEAD TO PRODUCTION RATE INCREASES IN ORDER

TO MEET THE DELIVERY SCHEDULES. FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ANY PRODUCTION RATE CHANGES COULD LEAD TO EXTENDED DELIVERY COMMITMENTS, AND DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF DELAY IN MEETING DELIVERY COMMITMENTS, ADDITIONAL COSTS AND CUSTOMERS

RESCHEDULING THEIR DELIVERIES OR TERMINATING THEIR RELATED CONTRACT WITH US.

WE DEPEND HEAVILY ON U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO

UNIQUE RISKS.

IN 2009, 43% OF OUR REVENUES WERE DERIVED FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION TO NORMAL BUSINESS RISKS, OUR CONTRACTS WITH

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

THE FUNDING OF U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IS

SUBJECT TO CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS

. MANY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE MAY LAST SEVERAL YEARS; HOWEVER, THESE PROGRAMS ARE NORMALLY FUNDED ANNUALLY. CHANGES IN MILITARY STRATEGY AND PRIORITIES MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE

PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND EXISTING PROGRAMS. LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND RELATED ORDERS ARE SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION, OR DELAY, IF APPROPRIATIONS FOR SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE PERIODS ARE NOT MADE. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. DOD BUDGET IS UNDER

PRESSURE DUE TO COMPETING NATIONAL PRIORITIES. THE TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF FUNDING FOR EXISTING OR NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY MODIFY, CURTAIL OR TERMINATE OUR CONTRACTS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY MODIFY, CURTAIL OR TERMINATE ITS CONTRACTS AND

SUBCONTRACTS WITH US, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE AND AT ITS CONVENIENCE UPON PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COMMITMENTS MADE AT THE TIME OF TERMINATION. MODIFICATION, CURTAILMENT OR TERMINATION OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR MAJOR PROGRAMS OR CONTRACTS COULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR CONTRACT COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY U.S.

GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

. U.S. GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES MAY AUDIT THE COSTS WE INCUR ON OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, INCLUDING ALLOCATED INDIRECT COSTS. SUCH AUDITS COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR CONTRACT COSTS. ANY COSTS FOUND TO BE

IMPROPERLY ALLOCATED TO A SPECIFIC CONTRACT WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED, AND SUCH COSTS ALREADY REIMBURSED MUST BE REFUNDED. WE HAVE RECORDED CONTRACT REVENUES BASED UPON COSTS WE EXPECT TO REALIZE UPON FINAL AUDIT. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT KNOW THE OUTCOME OF

ANY FUTURE AUDITS AND ADJUSTMENTS AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR PROFITS UPON COMPLETION AND FINAL NEGOTIATION OF AUDITS. IF ANY AUDIT UNCOVERS IMPROPER OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND

ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS, INCLUDING TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS, FORFEITURE OF PROFITS, SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS, FINES AND SUSPENSION OR PROHIBITION FROM DOING BUSINESS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS.

WE ARE SOMETIMES SUBJECT TO CERTAIN U.S. GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES

AND INVESTIGATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES DUE TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. ANY SUCH INQUIRY OR INVESTIGATION COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS AND OTHER

REQUIREMENTS.

THESE REQUIREMENTS, ALTHOUGH CUSTOMARY IN U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, INCREASE OUR PERFORMANCE AND COMPLIANCE COSTS. THESE COSTS MIGHT INCREASE IN THE FUTURE, REDUCING OUR MARGINS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL

CONDITION. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS COULD LEAD TO SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT, FOR CAUSE, FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING OR SUBCONTRACTING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR REPUTATION AND

ABILITY TO SECURE FUTURE U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

WE ENTER INTO FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO LOSSES IF WE HAVE COST

OVERRUNS.

MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS IN BDS AND MOST OF OUR CONTRACTS IN COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES ARE ON A FIXED-PRICE BASIS. APPROXIMATELY 50% OF BDS

REVENUES ARE GENERATED FROM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS. WHILE FIRM FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS ENABLE US TO BENEFIT FROM PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS, COST REDUCTIONS AND EFFICIENCIES, THEY ALSO SUBJECT US TO THE RISK OF REDUCED MARGINS OR INCURRING LOSSES IF WE

ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE ESTIMATED COSTS AND REVENUES. IF OUR ESTIMATED COSTS EXCEED OUR ESTIMATED PRICE, WE RECOGNIZE REACH-FORWARD LOSSES WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR REPORTED RESULTS.

THE LONG TERM NATURE OF MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS AND PROGRAMS MAKES THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING COSTS AND REVENUES ON FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS INHERENTLY RISKY. FOR EXAMPLE

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT ARE NORMALLY SOLD ON A FIRM FIXED-PRICE BASIS WITH AN INDEXED PRICE ESCALATION CLAUSE. THESE ESCALATION CLAUSES ACCOUNT FOR ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME FROM SALE TO DELIVERY WHICH CAN SPAN MANY YEARS. A

PRICE ESCALATION FORMULA BASED ON PRE-DEFINED FACTORS IS USED TO DETERMINE THE FINAL PRICE OF THE AIRPLANE AT THE TIME OF CUSTOMER DELIVERY. CHANGES IN FUTURE ESTIMATES OF THE UNDERLYING PRICE ESCALATION INDEX CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT ESTIMATED

REVENUES AND MARGINS IN ANY QUARTER. FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS IN OUR BDS BUSINESS OFTEN CONTAIN PRICE INCENTIVES AND PENALTIES TIED TO PERFORMANCE WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE AND HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON MARGINS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR

CONTRACTS HAVE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS RELATING TO COST, SCHEDULE AND PERFORMANCE. IF WE FAIL TO MEET THE TERMS SPECIFIED IN THOSE CONTRACTS, OUR SALES PRICE COULD BE REDUCED, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT WORK INHERENTLY HAS MORE UNCERTAINTY THAN WORK PURSUANT TO PRODUCTION CONTRACTS AND, THEREFORE, MORE VARIABILITY IN ESTIMATES OF THE COST TO

COMPLETE THE WORK. FIXED PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS INHERENTLY HAVE MORE UNCERTAINTY THAN FIXED PRICE PRODUCTION CONTRACTS. EXAMPLES OF SIGNIFICANT BDS FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS INCLUDE AEW&C, INTERNATIONAL KC-767 TANKERS AND COMMERCIAL

AND MILITARY SATELLITES. EXAMPLES OF SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE 787 AND 747-8. MANY OF THESE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS HAVE VERY COMPLEX DESIGNS. AS TECHNICAL OR QUALITY ISSUES ARISE, WE MAY EXPERIENCE SCHEDULE

DELAYS AND HIGHER COSTS TO COMPLETE. ADDITIONALLY, PRICE ESCALATION FACTORS MAY ALSO IMPACT MARGINS BY REDUCING THE ESTIMATED PRICE OF AIRPLANES DELIVERED IN THE FUTURE. BOTH OF THESE FACTORS MAY ULTIMATELY RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHARGE IF THE PROGRAM

HAS OR IS DETERMINED TO HAVE A REACH FORWARD LOSS. SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS AND DELIVERY RATES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM AND DELIVER TO CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS, OUR CONTRACT PRICE COULD BE

REDUCED THROUGH THE INCORPORATION OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT FOR DEFAULT, OR OTHER FINANCIALLY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE. MANAGEMENT USES ITS BEST JUDGMENT TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO PERFORM THE WORK, THE PRICE WE WILL EVENTUALLY BE

PAID AND, IN THE CASE OF COMMERCIAL PROGRAMS, THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO INCLUDE IN THE INITIAL ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. WHILE WE BELIEVE THE COST AND PRICE ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE, FUTURE EVENTS COULD RESULT IN

EITHER UPWARD OR DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE ESTIMATES. CHANGES TO ESTIMATES OF THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, PRODUCTION COSTS AND RATES, LEARNING CURVE, COSTS OF DERIVATIVE AIRCRAFT, CUSTOMER NEGOTIATIONS/SETTLEMENTS, SUPPLIER CLAIMS AND

CERTIFICATION ISSUES COULD ALSO RESULT IN LOWER MARGINS OR REACH-FORWARD LOSSES. WE MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE TECHNICAL AND QUALITY ISSUES REQUIRING FURTHER DELAYS IN SCHEDULE OR REVISIONS TO OUR COST ESTIMATES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS OUR ABILITY TO SELL TEST AIRCRAFT OR INITIAL UNITS PRODUCED CAN ALSO

AFFECT OUR RESULTS. FOR EXAMPLE IN 2009 WE DETERMINED THAT THREE OF THE 787 FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT COULD NOT BE SOLD. THIS RESULTED IN $2.7 BILLION BEING ACCOUNTED FOR AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AS OPPOSED TO BEING CAPITALIZED AS INVENTORY.

OUR INABILITY TO SELL ADDITIONAL TEST AIRCRAFT COULD INCREASE FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES.

WE ENTER INTO COST-TYPE CONTRACTS WHICH

ALSO CARRY RISKS.

APPROXIMATELY 50% OF BDS REVENUES ARE GENERATED FROM COST-TYPE CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENTS. SOME OF THESE ARE DEVELOPMENT

PROGRAMS THAT HAVE COMPLEX DESIGN AND TECHNICAL CHALLENGES. THESE COST-TYPE PROGRAMS TYPICALLY HAVE AWARD OR INCENTIVE FEES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY AND MAY BE EARNED OVER EXTENDED PERIODS. IN THESE CASES THE ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL RISKS ARE

PRIMARILY IN LOWER PROFIT RATES OR PROGRAM CANCELLATION IF COST, SCHEDULE OR TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUES ARISE. PROGRAMS WHOSE CONTRACTS ARE PRIMARILY COST-TYPE INCLUDE GMD, BCTM (FORMERLY FCS), P-8A POSEIDON, PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS,

AIRBORNE LASER, JTRS, FAB-T AND THE EA-18G GROWLER.

WE ENTER INTO CONTRACTS THAT INCLUDE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THAT SUBJECT US TO RISKS.

CONTRACTS IN THE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE INDUSTRY AND CERTAIN GOVERNMENT SATELLITE CONTRACTS INCLUDE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. THESE IN-ORBIT

PAYMENTS MAY BE PAID OVER TIME AFTER FINAL SATELLITE ACCEPTANCE OR PAID IN FULL PRIOR TO FINAL SATELLITE ACCEPTANCE. IN BOTH CASES, THE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENT IS AT RISK IF THE SATELLITE DOES NOT PERFORM TO SPECIFICATIONS FOR UP TO 15 YEARS

AFTER ACCEPTANCE. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE FEES WE ULTIMATELY EXPECT TO REALIZE IS RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE IN THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD. IF THE SATELLITE FAILS TO MEET CONTRACTUAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, CUSTOMERS WILL NOT BE

OBLIGATED TO CONTINUE MAKING IN-ORBIT PAYMENTS AND/OR WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE REFUNDS TO THE CUSTOMER AND INCUR SIGNIFICANT CHARGES.

WE USE ESTIMATES IN ACCOUNTING FOR MANY CONTRACTS AND PROGRAMS. CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

CONTRACT AND PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRE JUDGMENT RELATIVE TO ASSESSING RISKS, ESTIMATING REVENUES AND COSTS AND MAKING ASSUMPTIONS FOR SCHEDULE AND TECHNICAL ISSUES. DUE TO THE SIZE AND NATURE OF MANY OF OUR

CONTRACTS AND PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATION OF TOTAL REVENUES AND COST AT COMPLETION IS COMPLICATED AND SUBJECT TO MANY VARIABLES. ASSUMPTIONS HAVE TO BE MADE REGARDING THE LENGTH OF TIME TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACT OR PROGRAM BECAUSE COSTS ALSO INCLUDE

EXPECTED INCREASES IN WAGES, MATERIAL PRICES AND ALLOCATED FIXED COSTS. INCENTIVES OR PENALTIES RELATED TO PERFORMANCE ON CONTRACTS ARE CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING SALES AND PROFIT RATES, AND ARE RECORDED WHEN THERE IS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR US TO

ASSESS ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE. SUPPLIERS ASSERTIONS ARE ALSO ASSESSED AND CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING COSTS AND PROFIT RATES. ESTIMATES OF AWARD FEES ARE ALSO USED IN SALES AND PROFIT RATES BASED ON ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED AWARDS.

UNDER PROGRAM ACCOUNTING, INVENTORIABLE PRODUCTION COSTS (INCLUDING OVERHEAD), PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED AND CHARGED AS COST OF

SALES BY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF BY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR CONTRACTS. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND

ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS LIMITED BY THE ABILITY TO MAKE REASONABLY DEPENDABLE ESTIMATES. TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP OF SALES TO COST OF SALES, PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF (A) THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN A

PROGRAM, (B) THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE UNITS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED AND (C) THE UNITS EXPECTED SALES PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM. SEVERAL FACTORS

DETERMINE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, INCLUDING FIRM ORDERS, LETTERS OF INTENT FROM PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS AND MARKET STUDIES. SUCH ESTIMATES ARE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RECONSIDERED THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF OUR PROGRAMS. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE, CIRCUMSTANCES OR ESTIMATES CONCERNING THE SELECTION OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY OR

CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, ALONG WITH A FAILURE TO REALIZE PREDICTED COSTS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

BECAUSE OF THE

SIGNIFICANCE OF THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATION PROCESSES DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS LIKELY THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT SALES AND PROFIT AMOUNTS COULD BE RECORDED IF WE USED DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR IF THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, CIRCUMSTANCES OR ESTIMATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE PERIOD FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR RECOGNIZING SALES AND PROFITS, SEE OUR DISCUSSION UNDER MANAGEMENTS

DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESCONTRACT ACCOUNTING/PROGRAM ACCOUNTING ON PAGES 43-45 AND NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 56-57 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DISCOUNT RATES, ACTUAL INVESTMENT RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS AND OTHER FACTORS COULD AFFECT OUR EARNINGS, EQUITY, AND PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS

IN FUTURE PERIODS.

OUR EARNINGS MAY BE POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE AMOUNT OF INCOME OR EXPENSE WE RECORD FOR OUR PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP) REQUIRE THAT WE CALCULATE INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR THE PLANS USING ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. THESE VALUATIONS REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO

FINANCIAL MARKET AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS CAN CHANGE THE ASSUMPTIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT YEAR-END ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR ARE

THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND EXPECTED FUTURE MEDICAL INFLATION. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO

EQUITY THROUGH A REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING HOW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLAN ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND

ANALYSISCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESPOSTRETIREMENT PLANS ON PAGES 46-47 OF THIS FORM 10-K. ALTHOUGH GAAP EXPENSE AND PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED, THE KEY ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT GAAP

EXPENSE WOULD ALSO LIKELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CASH OR COMMON STOCK WE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. POTENTIAL PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDE BOTH MANDATORY AMOUNTS REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AND DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO IMPROVE THE PLANS FUNDED STATUS.

SOME OF OUR AND OUR SUPPLIERS

WORKFORCES ARE REPRESENTED BY LABOR UNIONS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO WORK STOPPAGES.

APPROXIMATELY 57,000 EMPLOYEES, WHICH CONSTITUTE APPROXIMATELY 36%

OF OUR TOTAL WORKFORCE, ARE UNION REPRESENTED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. WE EXPERIENCED A WORK STOPPAGE IN 2008 WHEN A LABOR STRIKE HALTED COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND CERTAIN BMA PROGRAM PRODUCTION AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL WORK STOPPAGES IN

THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW STABLE OUR RELATIONSHIPS, CURRENTLY WITH 14 DIFFERENT U.S. LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND 7 DIFFERENT NON-U.S. LABOR ORGANIZATIONS, WILL BE OR WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THE

UNIONS REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT IMPACTING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE UNIONS MAY ALSO LIMIT OUR FLEXIBILITY IN DEALING WITH OUR WORKFORCE. UNION ACTIONS AT SUPPLIERS CAN ALSO AFFECT US. WORK STOPPAGES AND INSTABILITY IN OUR UNION RELATIONSHIPS

COULD DELAY THE PRODUCTION AND/OR DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD STRAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND CAUSE A LOSS OF REVENUES WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.

COMPETITION WITHIN OUR MARKETS MAY REDUCE OUR PROCUREMENT OF FUTURE CONTRACTS AND SALES.

THE MARKETS IN

WHICH WE OPERATE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE MORE EXTENSIVE OR MORE SPECIALIZED ENGINEERING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING CAPABILITIES THAN WE DO IN SOME AREAS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR LARGEST CUSTOMERS COULD DEVELOP THE

CAPABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS OR

10

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROVIDE SERVICES SIMILAR TO PRODUCTS THAT WE MANUFACTURE OR SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. THIS WOULD RESULT IN THESE CUSTOMERS SUPPLYING THEIR OWN PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AND COMPETING DIRECTLY WITH US

FOR SALES OF THESE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, ALL OF WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES. FURTHERMORE, WE ARE FACING INCREASED INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION AND CROSS-BORDER CONSOLIDATION OF COMPETITION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE

ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST OUR CURRENT OR FUTURE COMPETITORS OR THAT THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WE FACE WILL NOT RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUES AND MARKET SHARE.

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM NON-U.S. SALES AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

IN 2009, SALES TO NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 42% OF OUR REVENUES. WE EXPECT THAT NON-U.S. SALES WILL CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS

A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING.

·

CHANGES IN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS;

·

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS TO EXPEND A PORTION OF PROGRAM FUNDS LOCALLY AND GOVERNMENTAL INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION

REQUIREMENTS;

·

FLUCTUATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES;

·

VOLATILITY IN FOREIGN POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS AND CHANGES IN FOREIGN NATIONAL PRIORITIES AND BUDGETS, WHICH CAN LEAD TO DELAYS OR FLUCTUATIONS IN

ORDERS;

·

THE COMPLEXITY AND NECESSITY OF USING NON-U.S. REPRESENTATIVES AND CONSULTANTS;

·

THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ABILITY OF NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS TO FINANCE PURCHASES;

·

UNCERTAINTIES AND RESTRICTIONS CONCERNING THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING CREDIT OR GUARANTEES;

·

IMPOSITION OF TAXES, EXPORT CONTROLS, TARIFFS, EMBARGOES AND OTHER TRADE RESTRICTIONS;

·

THE DIFFICULTY OF MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION OF AN ENTERPRISE SPREAD OVER VARIOUS COUNTRIES;

·

COMPLIANCE WITH A VARIETY OF INTERNATIONAL LAWS, AS WELL AS U.S. LAWS AFFECTING THE ACTIVITIES OF U.S. COMPANIES ABROAD; AND

·

ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND CONDITIONS.

WHILE THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE FACTORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.

THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IN WHICH WE HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT AND OF GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING OUR BUSINESS IS UNPREDICTABLE AND AN ADVERSE DECISION IN ANY SUCH MATTER COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

MONETARY PAYMENTS AND HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF

LITIGATION MATTERS. THESE CLAIMS MAY DIVERT FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE USED TO BENEFIT OUR OPERATIONS. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE RESULTS OF THESE MATTERS WILL BE FAVORABLE TO US. AN ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF ANY

OF THESE LAWSUITS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SOMETIMES SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS DUE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO OUR BUSINESS

RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE U.S GOVERNMENT, THE HEAVILY REGULATED NATURE OF OUR INDUSTRY, AND IN THE CASE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS, OUR OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN PROPERTY. ANY SUCH INQUIRY OR INVESTIGATION COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN AN ADVERSE RULING

AGAINST US, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY PAYMENTS (INCLUDING POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS) AND A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

A SUBSTANTIAL DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES

TO THE FINANCIAL OR REGULATORY LANDSCAPE COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION, WHICH COULD IN TURN HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

BCC, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, HAS SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS PORTFOLIO CONCENTRATED AMONG COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS. IF TERRORIST ATTACKS, A SERIOUS HEALTH

EPIDEMIC, SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY ACTIONS IN RESPONSE TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONCERNS, INCREASES IN FUEL RELATED COSTS OR OTHER EXOGENOUS EVENTS WERE TO HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY, INCREASED REQUESTS FOR FINANCING, SIGNIFICANT DEFAULTS

BY AIRLINE CUSTOMERS, REPOSSESSIONS OF AIRCRAFT AND/OR AIRLINE BANKRUPTCIES AND RESTRUCTURINGS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE STRENGTH OF BCCS PORTFOLIO AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS. IN ADDITION, A SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE AIRCRAFT FINANCING

ENVIRONMENT, OR SIGNIFICANT REGULATORY REFORMS THAT INCREASE COSTS TO COMPANIES LIKE BCC, COULD IMPACT BCCS FINANCIAL POSITION AND OPERATING RESULTS. ANY OF THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL

POSITION.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN DEBT TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS AT COMPETITIVE RATES, ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE

TERMS OR IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS.

WE DEPEND, IN PART, UPON THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS. IF WE WERE

CALLED UPON TO FUND ALL OUTSTANDING FINANCING COMMITMENTS, OUR MARKET LIQUIDITY MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT. A NUMBER OF FACTORS COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR INCREASED BORROWING COSTS AND TO HAVE GREATER DIFFICULTY ACCESSING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MARKETS FOR

DEBT. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE DISRUPTIONS OR DECLINES IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND/OR A DECLINE IN OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR OUTLOOK OR CREDIT RATINGS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OR ALL OF THESE EVENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR

OPERATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL OR FINANCING COMMITMENTS.

WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, JOINT

VENTURES/STRATEGIC ALLIANCES OR DIVESTITURES.

AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE MAY MERGE WITH OR ACQUIRE BUSINESSES, FORM JOINT

VENTURES/STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND DIVEST OPERATIONS. WHETHER WE REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS DEPENDS, IN PART, UPON THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE BUSINESSES INVOLVED, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING PRODUCTS, CAPABILITIES

OR TECHNOLOGIES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE TRANSACTED OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED FROM UNANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE ISSUES, TRANSACTION-RELATED CHARGES, AMORTIZATION OF EXPENSES RELATED TO INTANGIBLES,

CHARGES FOR IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-TERM ASSETS, CREDIT GUARANTEES, PARTNER PERFORMANCE AND INDEMNIFICATIONS. CONSOLIDATIONS OF JOINT VENTURES COULD ALSO IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED

APPROPRIATE AND ADEQUATE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. DIVESTITURES MAY RESULT IN CONTINUED FINANCIAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES, SUCH AS THROUGH

GUARANTEES OR OTHER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS, FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTION. NONPERFORMANCE BY THOSE DIVESTED BUSINESSES COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER ALL SIGNIFICANT RISK EXPOSURES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO LIABILITIES THAT ARE UNIQUE

TO THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE PROVIDE. WHILE WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN RISKS AND, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MAY RECEIVE INDEMNIFICATION FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, INSURANCE CANNOT BE OBTAINED TO PROTECT AGAINST ALL RISKS AND LIABILITIES. IT

IS THEREFORE POSSIBLE THAT THE AMOUNT OF OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT COVER ALL CLAIMS OR LIABILITIES, AND WE MAY BE FORCED TO BEAR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS.

OF OPERATIONS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW

WE ARE A GLOBAL MARKET LEADER IN DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE, SALE AND SUPPORT OF COMMERCIAL

JETLINERS, MILITARY AIRCRAFT, SATELLITES, MISSILE DEFENSE, HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT AND LAUNCH SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. WE ARE ONE OF THE TWO MAJOR MANUFACTURERS OF 100+ SEAT AIRPLANES FOR THE WORLDWIDE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY AND ONE OF THE LARGEST

DEFENSE CONTRACTORS IN THE U.S. WHILE OUR PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS ARE IN THE U.S., WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON A NETWORK OF PARTNERS, KEY SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS AROUND THE WORLD.

OUR STRATEGY IS CENTERED ON SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION IN HEALTHY CORE BUSINESSES  COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES AND BOEING DEFENSE, SPACE & SECURITY (BDS)  SUPPLEMENTED AND SUPPORTED BY BOEING CAPITAL

CORPORATION (BCC). TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE CORE BUSINESSES HAVE HISTORICALLY GENERATED SUBSTANTIAL EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW THAT PERMIT US TO INVEST IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT OPEN NEW FRONTIERS IN AEROSPACE. WE FOCUS ON PRODUCING THE AIRPLANES

THE MARKET DEMANDS AND WE PRICE OUR PRODUCTS TO PROVIDE A FAIR RETURN FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS WHILE CONTINUING TO FIND NEW WAYS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY. BDS INTEGRATES ITS RESOURCES IN DEFENSE, INTELLIGENCE, COMMUNICATIONS, SECURITY AND SPACE

TO DELIVER CAPABILITY-DRIVEN SOLUTIONS TO ITS CUSTOMERS AT REDUCED COSTS. OUR STRATEGY IS TO LEVERAGE OUR CORE BUSINESSES TO CAPTURE KEY NEXT-GENERATION PROGRAMS WHILE EXPANDING OUR PRESENCE IN ADJACENT AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, UNDERSCORED BY AN

INTENSE FOCUS ON GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY. OUR STRATEGY ALSO BENEFITS AS THE CYCLICALITY OF COMMERCIAL AND DEFENSE MARKETS OFTEN OFFSET. BCC DELIVERS VALUE BY SUPPORTING OUR BUSINESS UNITS AND MANAGING OVERALL FINANCING EXPOSURE.

REVENUES IN 2009 INCREASED BY $7,372 MILLION DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES IN COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES AND BDS. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES REVENUES

INCREASED BY $5,788, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DELIVERIES IN 2009. DELIVERIES IN 2008 WERE LOWER AS A RESULT OF A LABOR STRIKE IN THE PRIOR YEAR. INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN COMMERCIAL AVIATION SERVICES AND

INTERCOMPANY REVENUES. BDS REVENUES INCREASED BY $1,614 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES IN GLOBAL SERVICES & SUPPORT (GS&S) AND BOEING MILITARY AIRPLANES (BMA), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN NETWORK & SPACE SYSTEMS

(N&SS). BCC REVENUES DECREASED BY $43 MILLION DURING THE YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE CUSTOMER FINANCING PORTFOLIO. OTHER SEGMENT REVENUES DECREASED BY $402 MILLION PARTLY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES IN THE PRIOR YEAR FROM THE SALE OF FOUR

C-17 AIRCRAFT HELD UNDER OPERATING LEASE. LOWER UNALLOCATED ITEMS AND ELIMINATIONS IMPROVED REVENUES BY $415 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER P-8A POSEIDON PROGRAM (P-8A) INTERCOMPANY REVENUES RECOGNIZED BY COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES IN 2009 COMPARED WITH

2008.

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE DECREASE IN 2008 REVENUES OF $5,478 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2007, IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES AT COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANES. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES REVENUES DECREASED BY $5,123 MILLION, PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF DECREASES IN NEW AIRPLANE DELIVERIES REFLECTING THE EFFECTS OF THE LABOR STRIKE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTERCOMPANY REVENUES AND HIGHER PRE-STRIKE

DELIVERIES AND MODEL MIX. WE DELIVERED 104 FEWER AIRPLANES THAN EXPECTED DURING 2008 DUE TO THE STRIKE. THIS REDUCED REVENUE BY APPROXIMATELY $6.4 BILLION FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2008. BDS REVENUES WERE UNCHANGED AS REVENUE

GROWTH IN GS&S WAS OFFSET BY DECREASES IN BMA AND N&SS. BCC REVENUES DECREASED BY $112 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTEREST INCOME ON FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND NOTES AND A DECREASE IN THE CUSTOMER FINANCING PORTFOLIO. OTHER SEGMENT

REVENUES INCREASED BY $259 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SALE OF FOUR C-17 AIRCRAFT DURING 2008, THAT WERE HELD UNDER AN OPERATING LEASE. UNALLOCATED ITEMS AND ELIMINATIONS CHANGED BY $497 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INTERCOMPANY ELIMINATION OF

P-8A REVENUES RECOGNIZED BY COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES.

OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2009 DECREASED BY $1,854 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2008. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES EARNINGS

DECREASED BY $1,769 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO $2,693 MILLION OF COSTS RELATED TO THE FIRST THREE 787 FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF OUR DETERMINATION IN AUGUST 2009 THAT THESE AIRCRAFT COULD NOT BE

SOLD. THE EARNINGS DECREASE IS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO REACH-FORWARD LOSSES ON THE 747 PROGRAM WHICH GREW BY $1,352 MILLION IN 2009 WHICH IS AN INCREASE OF $667 MILLION OVER 2008. LOWER COMMERCIAL AVIATION SERVICES AND INTERCOMPANY EARNINGS ALSO

CONTRIBUTED TO LOWER 2009 EARNINGS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DELIVERIES IN 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008. BDS EARNINGS INCREASED BY $67 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EARNINGS IN THE BMA

SEGMENT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER EARNINGS IN THE N&SS SEGMENT. BCC OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED $36 MILLION REFLECTING LOWER REVENUES, HIGHER IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE AND A PROVISION FOR LOSSES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST EXPENSE. OTHER

SEGMENT LOSSES DECREASED BY $155 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO RECOGNITION OF PRE-TAX EXPENSE OF $82 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION CHARGES COMPARED

WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. UNALLOCATED ITEMS AND ELIMINATIONS IN 2009 REDUCED EARNINGS BY $271 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2008, WHICH IS FURTHER EXPLAINED IN THE TABLE BELOW.

OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2008 DECREASED BY $1,880 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2007. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES EARNINGS DECREASED BY $2,398 MILLION COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO FEWER NEW AIRPLANE

DELIVERIES RESULTING FROM THE STRIKE, INCREASED PROGRAM INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS RELATED TO THE STRIKE AND REVISED SCHEDULES ON 787 AND 747-8, AND A CHARGE TAKEN ON THE 747-8 PROGRAM. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE DECREASED

BY $124 MILLION TO $2,838 MILLION COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN 2007, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER SPENDING ON 787 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER SPENDING ON 747-8 AND LOWER SUPPLIER DEVELOPMENT COST SHARING PAYMENTS. BDS EARNINGS DECREASED BY $208 MILLION

COMPARED WITH 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER EARNINGS IN THE BMA SEGMENT RESULTING FROM CHARGES TAKEN ON THE AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING AND CONTROL (AEW&C). BCC OPERATING

THE REDUCTION IN SHARE-BASED PLANS EXPENSE IN 2008 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXPIRATION OF CERTAIN PERFORMANCE

SHARES DURING 2008 AND HIGHER EXPENSE ACCELERATION DURING 2007, RESULTING FROM SIX PAYOUTS COMPARED WITH ZERO PAYOUTS IN 2008.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION

EXPENSE INCREASED BY $381 MILLION IN 2009 AND DECREASED BY $274 MILLION IN 2008. THE YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGES IN DEFERRED COMPENSATION EXPENSE ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN OUR STOCK PRICE AND BROAD STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS.

OTHER UNALLOCATED ITEMS AND ELIMINATIONS EXPENSE INCREASED BY $154 MILLION IN 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING OF INTERCOMPANY EXPENSE ALLOCATIONS, ELIMINATION OF PROFIT

ON INTERCOMPANY ITEMS AND A MORE FAVORABLE INSURANCE ADJUSTMENT IN THE SAME PERIODS OF THE PRIOR YEAR. OTHER UNALLOCATED ITEMS AND EXPENSE IN 2008 INCLUDES A CHARGE RELATED TO SATELLITE LITIGATION OF $100 MILLION, OFFSET BY LOWER PERFORMANCE-BASED

COMPENSATION IN 2008.

UNALLOCATED PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COSTS RECOGNIZED UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP) IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FEDERAL COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS REQUIRED TO BE UTILIZED BY OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING PURPOSES. WE RECORDED NET

PERIODIC BENEFIT COST RELATED TO PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OF $1,816 MILLION, $1,132 MILLION AND $1,773 MILLION IN 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. NOT ALL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD INCURRED

BECAUSE IT IS ALLOCATED TO PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT COSTS AND A PORTION REMAINS IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. A PORTION OF PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE IS RECORDED IN THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE REMAINDER IS INCLUDED IN

UNALLOCATED PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE. EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS INCLUDED THE FOLLOWING AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND OTHER UNALLOCATED ITEMS AND ELIMINATIONS.

UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG

INCLUDES U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFINITIVE CONTRACTS FOR WHICH FUNDING HAVE NOT BEEN AUTHORIZED. THE DECREASE IN UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG DURING 2009 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES AT BDS OF $8,904 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2008 PARTLY DUE TO A PARTIAL

TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE BY THE U.S. ARMY OF THE BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM MODERNIZATION (BCTM) (FORMERLY THE FUTURE COMBAT SYSTEMS (FCS)) SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION CONTRACT RELATING TO MANNED GROUND VEHICLES AND ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS AND

EQUIPMENT. APPROVED FUNDING OF EXISTING MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS INCLUDING THE BCTM, V-22, CHINOOK, PROPRIETARY AND GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE (GMD) PROGRAMS ALSO REDUCED UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG. THE DECREASE IN UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG DURING 2008 IS

PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES AT BDS OF $2,174 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO FUNDING OF EXISTING MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS INCLUDING THE F/A-18, BCTM AND F-22 PROGRAMS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MULTI-YEAR PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS

AWARDED ON THE V-22 AND CHINOOK PROGRAMS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

AIRLINE INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT

2008 AND 2009 WERE EXTREMELY CHALLENGING FOR THE WORLDS AIRLINES AS KEY EXTERNAL BUSINESS FACTORS (OIL PRICES,

ECONOMIC GROWTH, EXCHANGE RATES, FINANCING TERMS) EXPERIENCED HIGH LEVELS OF VOLATILITY. IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2008, AIRLINES FOCUSED ON ADAPTING TO SPIKING OIL PRICES WHICH PEAKED CLOSE TO $150/BARREL. IN AUTUMN 2008, THE AIRLINES FOCUS

SHIFTED TO THE FALLOUT OF THE GLOBAL CREDIT CRISIS AND RECESSION AS FUEL PRICES FELL BELOW $40/BARREL FOR THE FIRST TIME SINCE 2004, AND IN 2009 PASSENGER AND CARGO TRAFFIC EXPERIENCED THEIR WORST EVER DECLINES. THIS BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT CURTAILED

THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY PROFIT RECOVERY THAT STARTED IN 2006. AS A RESULT, THE GLOBAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS NOW REPORTED LOSSES IN SEVEN OUT OF THE LAST TEN YEARS, AND OVER 30 AIRLINES HAVE ENTERED BANKRUPTCY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF 2008.

IN THIS CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT, AIRLINES ARE ADAPTING THEIR OPERATIONS TO MEET THE REALITIES OF THE MARKETS IN WHICH THEY OPERATE. AIRLINES REDUCED GLOBAL PASSENGER

CAPACITY BY 2% IN 2009 THROUGH A COMBINATION OF FREQUENCY AND ROUTE CUTS IN UNPROFITABLE MARKETS, LOWER DAILY AIRPLANE UTILIZATION (FLIGHT HOURS PER DAY) AND PARKING/SCRAPPING OF OLDER GENERATION AIRPLANES. AIRLINES ARE ALSO REPLACING OLDER LESS

FUEL EFFICIENT AIRPLANES, REDUCING NON-FUEL COSTS AND FINDING NEW WAYS TO PARTNER THROUGH ALLIANCES OR VIA MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS.

THESE CONDITIONS

HAVE CAUSED CUSTOMERS TO REQUEST CANCELLATIONS, MODIFICATIONS, OR RESCHEDULING OF THEIR EXISTING ORDERS AND ADVANCE PAYMENT SCHEDULES TO MEET REVISED FLEET PLANS OR ADDRESS FINANCING AND CASH FLOW ISSUES. WHETHER SUCH REQUESTS WILL RESULT IN A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOW OR FINANCIAL POSITION DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING WHETHER THE REQUEST IS GRANTED, THE TYPE OF AIRCRAFT, HOW MUCH COMPENSATION IS PAID TO US FOR COSTS ALREADY INCURRED AND OUR ABILITY TO

RESCHEDULE OTHER ORDERS TO REPLACE THOSE CANCELED, MODIFIED, OR RESCHEDULED.

NEAR-TERM GLOBAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY INDICATORS ARE IMPROVING ALTHOUGH MANY

UNCERTAINTIES PERSIST. GLOBAL ECONOMIC RECOVERY HAS BEGUN. ALTHOUGH IT IS EXPECTED TO VARY SIGNIFICANTLY BY REGION BOTH IN TERMS OF SPEED AND MAGNITUDE, WORLD ECONOMIC GROWTH IS FORECAST TO GROW MODERATELY IN 2010 FOLLOWING CONTRACTION IN 2009. AS A

RESULT, AIRLINE INDUSTRY FORECASTS GENERALLY INDICATE GLOBAL PASSENGER TRAFFIC RETURNING CLOSE TO 2008 LEVELS IN 2010 WITH MANY EMERGING MARKETS POSTING GROWTH OVER 2009. AIR CARGO TRAFFIC IS FORECAST TO GROW ABOVE THE LONG-TERM TREND RATES IN 2010

FOLLOWING TWO YEARS OF CONTRACTION WHICH HAVE TAKEN TRAFFIC BACK TO 2002 AND 2003 LEVELS. DUE TO THESE IMPROVING DEMAND CONDITIONS, AIRLINES ARE EXPECTED TO SEE SIGNIFICANTLY SMALLER FINANCIAL LOSSES GLOBALLY IN 2010.

BEYOND THE NEAR-TERM MARKET UNCERTAINTIES, THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR THE INDUSTRY REMAINS POSITIVE DUE TO THE FUNDAMENTAL DRIVERS OF AIR TRAVEL GROWTH: ECONOMIC

GROWTH AND THE INCREASING PROPENSITY TO TRAVEL DUE TO INCREASED TRADE, GLOBALIZATION AND IMPROVED AIRLINE SERVICES DRIVEN BY LIBERALIZATION OF AIR TRAFFIC RIGHTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES. OUR 20-YEAR FORECAST IS FOR A LONG-TERM AVERAGE GROWTH RATE OF

5% PER YEAR FOR PASSENGER AND CARGO TRAFFIC BASED ON A PROJECTED AVERAGE ANNUAL WORLDWIDE REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE OF 3%. BASED ON LONG-TERM GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH PROJECTIONS, AND FACTORING IN INCREASED UTILIZATION OF THE WORLDWIDE AIRPLANE

FLEET AND REQUIREMENTS TO REPLACE OLDER AIRPLANES, WE PROJECT A $3.2 TRILLION MARKET FOR 29,000 NEW AIRPLANES OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS.

THE INDUSTRY

REMAINS VULNERABLE TO NEAR-TERM EXOGENOUS DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING DISEASE OUTBREAKS (SUCH AS AVIAN OR H1N1 FLUS), TERRORISM AND INCREASED GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.

INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS

THE COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT MARKET AND THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REMAIN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT THE EXISTING LONG-TERM DOWNWARD TREND IN PASSENGER REVENUE YIELDS WORLDWIDE

(MEASURED IN REAL TERMS) TO CONTINUE INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. MARKET LIBERALIZATION IN

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EUROPE AND ASIA HAS ENABLED LOW-COST AIRLINES TO CONTINUE GAINING MARKET SHARE. THESE AIRLINES HAVE INCREASED THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON AIRFARES. THIS RESULTS IN CONTINUED COST PRESSURES FOR ALL

AIRLINES AND PRICE PRESSURE ON OUR PRODUCTS. MAJOR PRODUCTIVITY GAINS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE A FAVORABLE MARKET POSITION AT ACCEPTABLE PROFIT MARGINS.

CONTINUED ACCESS TO GLOBAL MARKETS REMAINS VITAL TO OUR ABILITY TO FULLY REALIZE OUR SALES POTENTIAL AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT RETURNS. APPROXIMATELY 10% OF COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG IN DOLLAR TERMS IS WITH U.S.

AIRLINES.

WE FACE AGGRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS WHO ARE INTENT ON INCREASING THEIR MARKET SHARE. THEY OFFER COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND HAVE ACCESS

TO MOST OF THE SAME CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. AIRBUS HAS HISTORICALLY INVESTED HEAVILY TO CREATE A FAMILY OF PRODUCTS TO COMPETE WITH OURS. REGIONAL JET MAKERS EMBRAER AND BOMBARDIER, COMING FROM THE LESS THAN 100-SEAT COMMERCIAL JET MARKET, CONTINUE

TO DEVELOP LARGER AND MORE CAPABLE AIRPLANES. ADDITIONALLY, OTHER COMPETITORS FROM RUSSIA, CHINA AND JAPAN ARE LIKELY TO ENTER THE 70 TO 190 SEAT AIRCRAFT MARKET OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THIS MARKET ENVIRONMENT HAS RESULTED IN INTENSE PRESSURES ON

PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS AND WE EXPECT THESE PRESSURES TO CONTINUE OR INTENSIFY IN THE COMING YEARS.

WORLDWIDE, AIRPLANE SALES ARE

GENERALLY CONDUCTED IN U.S. DOLLARS. FLUCTUATING EXCHANGE RATES AFFECT THE PROFIT POTENTIAL OF OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS, ALL OF WHOM HAVE SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN OTHER CURRENCIES. A DECLINE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO THEIR LOCAL CURRENCIES AS

EXPERIENCED IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2009 PUTS PRESSURE ON COMPETITORS REVENUES AND PROFITS. COMPETITORS OFTEN RESPOND BY AGGRESSIVELY REDUCING COSTS AND INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY, THEREBY IMPROVING THEIR LONGER-TERM COMPETITIVE POSTURE. AIRBUS HAS

ANNOUNCED SUCH INITIATIVES TARGETING OVERHEAD COST SAVINGS, A REDUCTION IN ITS DEVELOPMENT CYCLE AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH 2012. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS AGAIN, AIRBUS CAN USE THE IMPROVED EFFICIENCY TO FUND

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, GAIN MARKET SHARE THROUGH PRICING AND/OR IMPROVE EARNINGS.

WE ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OUR PROCESSES AND CONTINUING COST-REDUCTION

EFFORTS. WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE OUR EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES NETWORK WHICH INCLUDES AVIATION SUPPORT, SPARES, TRAINING, MAINTENANCE DOCUMENTS AND TECHNICAL ADVICE FOR AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THIS ENABLES US TO PROVIDE A HIGHER

LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND PRODUCTIVITY. THESE EFFORTS ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE PRICING STRATEGIES THAT ENABLE US TO PRICE COMPETITIVELY.

OFFSET BY LOWER INTERCOMPANY REVENUES. PRIOR YEAR REVENUES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE 2008 IAM STRIKE. THE DECREASE IN REVENUES FROM COMMERCIAL AVIATION SERVICES BUSINESS WAS DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

THE DECREASE IN REVENUE OF $5,123 MILLION IN 2008 FROM 2007 IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER NEW AIRPLANE DELIVERIES. THE IAM STRIKE RESULTED IN 104 AIRPLANE

DELIVERIES MOVING OUT OF 2008 WHICH REDUCED 2008 REVENUES BY $6,406 MILLION. THE STRIKE IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTERCOMPANY REVENUES OF $804 MILLION, AND HIGHER PRE-STRIKE DELIVERIES, NET OF MODEL MIX CHANGES, OF $726 MILLION.

AIRCRAFT TRADING ACTIVITY DECREASED BY $264 MILLION AS A RESULT OF FEWER SALES OF USED AIRCRAFT. REVENUES IN COMMERCIAL AVIATION SERVICES BUSINESS INCREASED BY $17 MILLION DRIVEN BY INCREASED SPARES AND SERVICES REVENUE OFFSET BY DECREASED PASSENGER

TO FREIGHTER CONVERSIONS.

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS

EARNINGS

FROM OPERATIONS FOR 2009 DECREASED BY $1,769 MILLION WHEN COMPARED TO 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RECLASSIFICATION FROM INVENTORY TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE OF $2,481 MILLION RELATED TO THE THREE 787 FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT PREVIOUSLY RECORDED

AS INVENTORY AS OF JULY 31, 2009. ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION COSTS INCURRED BETWEEN AUGUST AND DECEMBER 2009 OF $212 MILLION RELATED TO THOSE FLIGHT-TEST AIRPLANES WERE ALSO INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. THOSE AMOUNTS WERE PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY A $148 MILLION DECREASE IN OTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. THE DECREASE IN EARNINGS IS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO REACH-FORWARD LOSSES ON THE 747 PROGRAM WHICH GREW BY $1,352 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED WITH LOSSES OF $685 MILLION IN 2008.

THE 2009 REACH-FORWARD LOSSES WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PRODUCTION COSTS, REDUCTIONS IN PROJECTED DELIVERY PRICE INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH ESCALATION AND THE DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE 747-8. LOWER COMMERCIAL AVIATION SERVICES

23

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REVENUES AND MARGINS REDUCED EARNINGS BY $245 MILLION. HIGHER INFRASTRUCTURE COST ALLOCATIONS RELATED TO THE 787 AND 747-8 SCHEDULE DELAYS ANNOUNCED IN 2008 AND 2009 AND INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS

INCURRED DURING THE 2008 IAM STRIKE REDUCED EARNINGS BY $199 MILLION. INCREASED PERIOD AND OTHER COSTS REDUCED EARNINGS BY $47 MILLION. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED EARNINGS OF $1,934 MILLION RELATED TO NEW AIRPLANE DELIVERIES.

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS DECREASED BY $2,398 MILLION IN 2008 WHEN COMPARED TO 2007, WITH OPERATING MARGINS DECREASING 6.5 PERCENTAGE POINTS TO 4.2%.

LOWER NEW AIRPLANE DELIVERIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER INTERCOMPANY REVENUES, REDUCED EARNINGS BY $1,400 MILLION. A CHARGE FOR A REACH-FORWARD LOSS ON THE 747 PROGRAM RESULTING FROM INCREASES TO ESTIMATED COSTS FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF

747-8 DERIVATIVES REDUCED 2008 EARNINGS BY $685 MILLION. INFRASTRUCTURE COST ALLOCATIONS RELATED TO THE 787 AND 747-8 SCHEDULE DELAYS AND INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS INCURRED DURING THE IAM STRIKE REDUCED EARNINGS BY $287 MILLION. THE 787 AND 747-8

SCHEDULE DELAYS RESULTED IN PRODUCTION PROGRAMS RECEIVING LARGER ALLOCATIONS OF CURRENT AND FUTURE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS AND REDUCED MARGINS ON 2008 DELIVERIES, WHILE THE PROGRAM INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS INCURRED DURING THE IAM STRIKE DECREASED MARGINS

ON AIRPLANES DELIVERED DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. INCREASED PERIOD AND OTHER COSTS REDUCED EARNINGS BY $108 MILLION. A REDUCTION IN COMMERCIAL AVIATION SERVICES VOLUME AND MIX-RELATED EARNINGS OF $42 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE

IN VOLUME ON PASSENGER TO FREIGHTER CONVERSION PROGRAMS. LOWER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS IMPROVED EARNINGS BY $124 MILLION.

BACKLOG

FIRM

BACKLOG REPRESENTS ORDERS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WHERE NO CONTINGENCIES REMAIN BEFORE BOEING AND THE CUSTOMER ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM. BACKLOG DOES NOT INCLUDE PROSPECTIVE ORDERS WHERE CUSTOMER CONTROLLED CONTINGENCIES REMAIN, SUCH AS THE

CUSTOMERS RECEIVING APPROVAL FROM THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS OR GOVERNMENT AND COMPLETING FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. ALL SUCH CONTINGENCIES MUST BE SATISFIED OR HAVE EXPIRED PRIOR TO RECORDING A NEW FIRM ORDER EVEN IF SATISFYING SUCH

CONDITIONS IS HIGHLY CERTAIN. FIRM ORDERS EXCLUDE OPTIONS. A NUMBER OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE CONTRACTUAL REMEDIES THAT MAY BE IMPLICATED BY PROGRAM DELAYS. WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS CUSTOMER CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR OTHER CONTRACTUAL RELIEF AS THEY

ARISE. HOWEVER, ONCE ORDERS ARE INCLUDED IN FIRM BACKLOG, ORDERS REMAIN IN BACKLOG UNTIL CANCELED OR FULFILLED, ALTHOUGH THE VALUE OF ORDERS IS ADJUSTED AS CHANGES TO PRICE AND SCHEDULE ARE AGREED TO WITH CUSTOMERS.

THE DECREASE IN CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG DURING 2009 WAS DUE TO DELIVERIES IN EXCESS OF ORDERS, CHANGES IN PROJECTED REVENUE ESCALATION AND CANCELLATIONS OF ORDERS. THE

INCREASE IN BACKLOG DURING 2008 WAS DUE TO ORDERS IN EXCESS OF DELIVERIES FOR OUR 737, 767, 777 AND 787 PROGRAMS.

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY

THE

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY IS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE QUANTITY OF AIRPLANES THAT WILL BE PRODUCED FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS AND IS LIMITED BY THE ABILITY TO MAKE REASONABLY DEPENDABLE ESTIMATES OF THE REVENUE AND COSTS OF THESE

CONTRACTS. IT IS A KEY DETERMINANT OF THE GROSS MARGINS WE RECOGNIZE ON SALES OF INDIVIDUAL AIRPLANES THROUGHOUT A PROGRAMS LIFE. ESTIMATION OF EACH PROGRAMS ACCOUNTING QUANTITY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SEVERAL FACTORS THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF

THE DEMAND FOR THAT PROGRAM, INCLUDING FIRM ORDERS, LETTERS OF INTENT FROM PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS AND MARKET STUDIES. WE REVIEW OUR PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITIES QUARTERLY.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION COSTS INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS, A PORTION OF WHICH DOES NOT VARY WITH PRODUCTION RATES. AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME NEEDED TO PRODUCE THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY

INCREASES, THE AVERAGE COST OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY ALSO INCREASES AS THESE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL COST ESTIMATES. THIS HAS THE EFFECT OF DECREASING THE GROSS MARGIN AND RELATED EARNINGS PROVIDED OTHER FACTORS DO NOT

CHANGE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH PROGRAM MAY INCLUDE UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED, UNDELIVERED UNITS UNDER CONTRACT,

AND UNITS ANTICIPATED TO BE UNDER CONTRACT IN THE REASONABLE FUTURE (ANTICIPATED ORDERS). IN DEVELOPING TOTAL PROGRAM ESTIMATES ALL OF THESE ITEMS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY MUST BE CONSIDERED. THE TABLE BELOW PROVIDES DETAILS AS OF

737 PROGRAM

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 737 PROGRAM INCREASED BY 400 UNITS DURING 2009 DUE TO THE PROGRAMS NORMAL PROGRESSION OF OBTAINING ADDITIONAL

ORDERS AND DELIVERING AIRCRAFT. PRODUCTION RATES REMAINED UNCHANGED IN 2009.

747 PROGRAM

THERE WAS NO CHANGE IN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE

747 PROGRAM DURING 2009.

IN 2008, WE RECORDED A CHARGE OF $685 MILLION TO RECOGNIZE A REACH-FORWARD LOSS. THE CHARGE WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER

THAN ANTICIPATED COSTS DUE TO LATE CHANGES TO WING DESIGN WHICH DROVE NEW LOAD REQUIREMENTS INTO THE FUSELAGE AND CREATED OTHER STATEMENT OF WORK CHANGES FOR OUR SUPPLIERS.

DURING 2009, ADDITIONAL CHARGES OF $1,352 MILLION WERE RECORDED TO RECOGNIZE REACH-FORWARD LOSSES. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009, WE RECORDED $347 MILLION OF A REACH-FORWARD LOSS DUE TO A REDUCTION IN PROJECTED

DELIVERY PRICE INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH ESCALATION AND AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED COSTS DUE TO OUR DECISIONS TO REDUCE TWIN-AISLE PRODUCTION RATES WHICH IMPACT PRODUCTION RATES BEGINNING IN 2010. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2009 WE INCREASED THE

REACH-FORWARD LOSS ON THE 747 PROGRAM BY $1,005 MILLION. OF THIS AMOUNT, $643 MILLION WAS CAUSED BY HIGHER ESTIMATED PRODUCTION COSTS, INCLUDING BOTH ADDITIONAL INTERNAL PRODUCTION COSTS AND HIGHER SUPPLIER EXPENSES, ATTRIBUTABLE TO GREATER THAN

EXPECTED RE-WORK AND DISRUPTION IN MANUFACTURING DUE TO LATE MATURITY OF ENGINEERING DESIGNS AS WELL AS THE LIMITED AVAILABILITY OF ENGINEERING RESOURCES. THE REMAINING $362 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO CHALLENGING CARGO MARKET CONDITIONS AND OUR

RELATED DECISION TO DEFER A PLANNED INCREASE IN THE 747-8 PRODUCTION RATE, WHICH DROVE HIGHER ALLOCATIONS OF FIXED COSTS AND CAUSED US TO INCUR VOLUME-BASED PENALTIES TO SUPPLIERS.

FIRST FLIGHT OF THE 747-8 FREIGHTER IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, WITH THE FLIGHT TEST PROGRAM EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE IN 2010. FIRST DELIVERY OF THE 747-8 FREIGHTER IS EXPECTED IN THE

FOURTH

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

QUARTER OF 2010. FIRST DELIVERY OF THE INTERCONTINENTAL PASSENGER VARIANT REMAINS SCHEDULED FOR THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011. THE GAP BETWEEN THE DELIVERY OF THE LAST 747-400, WHICH OCCURRED IN

2009, AND FIRST DELIVERIES OF THE 747-8 WILL RESULT IN LOWER 747 PROGRAM REVENUES.

767 PROGRAM

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 767 PROGRAM

INCREASED BY 12 UNITS DURING 2009. IN APRIL 2009, WE ANNOUNCED A DELAY IN PREVIOUS PLANS TO INCREASE THE PRODUCTION RATE.

777 PROGRAM

THE

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 777 PROGRAM INCREASED BY 50 UNITS DURING 2009. DELIVERY OF THE FIRST 777 FREIGHTER OCCURRED IN FEBRUARY 2009. IN APRIL 2009, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WILL LOWER THE PRODUCTION RATE ON OUR 777 AIRPLANE PROGRAM, AFFECTING

DELIVERIES BEGINNING IN JUNE 2010. THIS LOWER PRODUCTION RATE WILL DECREASE REVENUES AND EARNINGS IN 2010 AND 2011.

787 PROGRAM

WE ANNOUNCED ON

JUNE 23, 2009 THE NECESSITY TO REINFORCE AN AREA OF STRUCTURE AT THE SIDE-OF-BODY SECTION OF THE AIRPLANE. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER, WE COMPLETED THE MODIFICATIONS ON THE FIRST TWO FLIGHT-TEST AIRPLANES AND THE FULL-SCALE STATIC TEST AIRPLANE.

FIRST FLIGHT OF THE 787 OCCURRED ON DECEMBER 15, 2009. A SECOND 787 COMPLETED ITS FIRST TEST FLIGHT ON DECEMBER 22, 2009. SIX AIRCRAFT IN TOTAL WILL BE INVOLVED IN THE FLIGHT TEST PROGRAM, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN CERTIFICATION OF

THE 787-8 IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010. FIRST DELIVERY IS ALSO EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010. WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD OUR PLANNED INCREASES IN 787 PRODUCTION RATES AS WELL AS THE TIMELY INTRODUCTION OF THE 787-9 DERIVATIVE.

DURING 2009, WE CONCLUDED THAT THE FIRST THREE FLIGHT-TEST 787 AIRCRAFT COULD NOT BE SOLD AS PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED DUE TO THE INORDINATE AMOUNT OF

REWORK AND UNIQUE AND EXTENSIVE MODIFICATIONS MADE TO THOSE AIRCRAFT. AS A RESULT, COSTS OF $2,481 MILLION PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AS PROGRAM INVENTORY AS OF JULY 31, 2009 WERE RECLASSIFIED TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION

COSTS INCURRED BETWEEN AUGUST AND DECEMBER 2009 OF $212 MILLION RELATED TO THESE FLIGHT-TEST AIRPLANES WERE ALSO INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INCUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ON THESE FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT IN

2010. WE BELIEVE THAT THE OTHER THREE ADDITIONAL 787 FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT ARE COMMERCIALLY SALEABLE AND WE CONTINUE TO INCLUDE COSTS RELATED TO THOSE AIRCRAFT IN PROGRAM INVENTORY AT DECEMBER 31, 2009. IF WE DETERMINE THAT ONE OR MORE OF THE

OTHER FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT CANNOT BE SOLD WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL CHARGES.

ON JULY 30, 2009, WE ACQUIRED THE BUSINESS, ASSETS AND OPERATIONS OF

VOUGHT AIRCRAFT INDUSTRIES, INC.S (VOUGHT) 787 BUSINESS CONDUCTED AT NORTH CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA. THE FACILITY PRODUCES AFT FUSELAGE SECTIONS, INCLUDING THE FABRICATION, ASSEMBLY AND SYSTEMS INSTALLATION. SEE NOTE 2. ON DECEMBER 22,

2009, WE ACQUIRED ALENIA NORTH AMERICAS 50% OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN GLOBAL AERONAUTICA. AS A RESULT OF THE TRANSACTION, WE ARE THE SOLE OWNER OF THIS ENTITY. LOCATED ADJACENT TO BOEING CHARLESTON, GLOBAL AERONAUTICA IS AN INTEGRATOR OF THE 787

MID-FUSELAGE SECTIONS.

ON OCTOBER 28, 2009 WE ANNOUNCED THE NORTH CHARLESTON FACILITY AS THE LOCATION FOR A SECOND FINAL ASSEMBLY SITE FOR THE 787

DREAMLINER PROGRAM. A GROUNDBREAKING CEREMONY WAS HELD NOVEMBER 20, 2009 TO MARK THE START OF CONSTRUCTION. UNTIL THE ADDITIONAL 787 ASSEMBLY LINE IS FULLY OPERATIONAL, WE WILL ESTABLISH TRANSITIONAL SURGE CAPABILITY AT OUR EVERETT, WASHINGTON,

LOCATION TO FACILITATE THE PLANNED INTRODUCTION OF THE 787-9, THE FIRST DERIVATIVE MODEL OF THE 787 FAMILY. WHEN THE ADDITIONAL LINE IN NORTH CHARLESTON IS FULLY OPERATIONAL, THE SURGE CAPABILITY IN EVERETT WILL BE PHASED OUT.

LOOKING BEYOND FIRST FLIGHT, WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ADDRESS OTHER AREAS OF CHALLENGE ASSOCIATED WITH ASSEMBLY OF INITIAL AIRPLANES INCLUDING MANAGEMENT OF OUR

EXTENDED GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN, COMPLETION AND INTEGRATION OF TRAVELED WORK AS WELL AS WEIGHT AND SYSTEMS INTEGRATION. EFFORTS CONTINUE TO ENSURE WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON SATISFYING CUSTOMER MISSION AND PERFORMANCE NEEDS IN LIGHT OF THE ANTICIPATED WEIGHT

OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AIRCRAFT.

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS TO ASSESS THE SPECIFIC IMPACTS OF SCHEDULE CHANGES INCLUDING

DELIVERY DELAYS AND SUPPLIER ASSERTIONS. A NUMBER OF OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE CONTRACTUAL REMEDIES FOR SCHEDULE DELAYS AND/OR PERFORMANCE. WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS CUSTOMER CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR OTHER CONTRACTUAL RELIEF AS BROUGHT FORTH.

THE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS OF THE FLIGHT TEST DELAYS, PRODUCTION CHALLENGES, SCHEDULE DELAYS AND CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER IMPACTS CREATE SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON PROGRAM

REVENUE AND COST ESTIMATES. WE CONTINUE TO ASSESS OUR MITIGATION PLANS AND COST REDUCTION EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THESE PRESSURES.

FLEET SUPPORT

WE

PROVIDE THE OPERATORS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES WITH ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES TO FACILITATE EFFICIENT AND SAFE AIRCRAFT OPERATION. COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS FLEET SUPPORT SERVICES, THESE ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES BEGIN PRIOR TO AIRCRAFT DELIVERY AND

CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE OPERATIONAL LIFE OF THE AIRCRAFT. THEY INCLUDE FLIGHT AND MAINTENANCE TRAINING, FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT COSTS, ENGINEERING SERVICES AND TECHNICAL DATA AND DOCUMENTS. THE COSTS FOR FLEET SUPPORT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND HAVE

BEEN HISTORICALLY LESS THAN 1.5% OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED COSTS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THIS LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES IS ANTICIPATED TO CONTINUE IN THE UPCOMING YEARS. THESE COSTS DO NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY WITH CURRENT PRODUCTION RATES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE FOLLOWING CHART SUMMARIZES THE TIME HORIZON BETWEEN GO-AHEAD AND CERTIFICATION/INITIAL DELIVERY FOR MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

DERIVATIVES AND PROGRAMS.

OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE INCREASED BY $2,545 MILLION IN 2009. THIS WAS DUE TO RECLASSIFICATION TO RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE OF $2,693 MILLION OF PRODUCTION COSTS RELATED TO THE THREE 787 FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT AND $50 MILLION OF LOWER SUPPLIER DEVELOPMENT COST SHARING PAYMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $198 MILLION DECREASE OF OTHER RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE.

OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE DECREASED $124 MILLION IN 2008. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IS NET OF DEVELOPMENT COST

SHARING PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS. THE DECREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING FOR 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED 787 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY $278 MILLION OF INCREASED SPENDING ON THE 747-8 PROGRAM AND $80

MILLION OF LOWER SUPPLIER DEVELOPMENT COST SHARING PAYMENTS.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

THE 787 AND 747-8 PROGRAMS HIGHLIGHT THE RISKS THAT ARE ALWAYS INHERENT IN NEW AIRPLANE PROGRAMS AND NEW DERIVATIVE AIRPLANES, PARTICULARLY AS BOTH THE 747-8 AND THE

787 BEGIN THE DEMANDING FLIGHT TEST AND CERTIFICATION PHASES OF PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. COSTS RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROGRAMS AND DERIVATIVE AIRPLANES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. COSTS TO PRODUCE NEW AIRCRAFT ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORY AND

ACCOUNTED FOR USING PROGRAM ACCOUNTING. AIRPLANE PROGRAMS HAVE RISK FOR REACH-FORWARD LOSSES IF OUR ESTIMATED PRODUCTION COSTS EXCEED OUR ESTIMATED PROGRAM REVENUES FOR THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. GENERALLY COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES ARE SOLD ON A FIRM

FIXED-PRICE BASIS WITH AN INDEXED PRICE ESCALATION CLAUSE AND ARE OFTEN SOLD SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE SCHEDULED DELIVERY. EACH CUSTOMER PURCHASE

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN ESCALATION CLAUSE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME FROM AIRPLANE SALE TO AIRPLANE DELIVERY. A PRICE ESCALATION FORMULA BASED ON

PRE-DEFINED FACTORS IS USED TO DETERMINE THE FINAL PRICE OF THE AIRPLANE AT THE TIME OF CUSTOMER DELIVERY. WHILE FIRM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS ALLOW US TO BENEFIT FROM COST SAVINGS, THEY ALSO EXPOSE US TO THE RISK OF COST OVERRUNS. MANY NEW AIRPLANES

AND DERIVATIVES HAVE HIGHLY COMPLEX DESIGNS, UTILIZE EXOTIC MATERIALS AND REQUIRE EXTENSIVE COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION WITH SUPPLIER PARTNERS. AS TECHNICAL OR QUALITY ISSUES ARISE, SUCH AS ISSUES EXPERIENCED ON THE 787 AND 747-8 PROGRAMS, WE MAY

EXPERIENCE SCHEDULE DELAYS AND HIGHER COSTS TO COMPLETE NEW PROGRAMS AND DERIVATIVE AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, PRICE ESCALATION FACTORS MAY ALSO IMPACT MARGINS BY REDUCING THE ESTIMATED PRICE OF AIRPLANES DELIVERED IN THE FUTURE. THERE ARE OTHER

FACTORS THAT COULD ALSO RESULT IN LOWER MARGINS OR A MATERIAL CHARGE IF A PROGRAM HAS OR IS DETERMINED TO HAVE REACH-FORWARD LOSSES. THESE INCLUDE: CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, PRODUCTION COSTS AND RATES, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND

OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASING OR ADDING NEW PRODUCTION CAPACITY, LEARNING CURVE, ANTICIPATED COST REDUCTIONS, FLIGHT TEST AND CERTIFICATION SCHEDULES, COSTS AND SCHEDULE FOR DERIVATIVE AIRPLANES AND STATUS OF CUSTOMER CLAIMS, SUPPLIER

ASSERTIONS AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL NEGOTIATIONS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THE COST AND REVENUE ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE, THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF THESE PROGRAMS CREATES FINANCIAL RISK AS ADDITIONAL COMPLETION COSTS

MAY BECOME NECESSARY OR SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES COULD BE EXTENDED, WHICH COULD TRIGGER TERMINATION PROVISIONS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS OR OTHER FINANCIALLY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE.

BOEING DEFENSE, SPACE & SECURITY

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

ON JANUARY 7, 2010, WE ANNOUNCED THAT INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS WILL BEGIN OPERATING UNDER THE NAME BOEING DEFENSE, SPACE & SECURITY (BDS).

BDS CONSISTS OF THREE CAPABILITIES-DRIVEN BUSINESSES: BOEING MILITARY AIRCRAFT (BMA), NETWORK & SPACE SYSTEMS (N&SS) AND GLOBAL SERVICES &

SUPPORT (GS&S). ADDITIONALLY, BDS PHANTOM WORKS SUPPORTS ALL THREE BUSINESSES VIA PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, RAPID PROTOTYPING AND CUSTOMER ENGAGEMENT THROUGH EXPERIMENTATION AND ENTERPRISE TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT STRATEGIES.

DEFENSE ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

THE U.S. CONTINUES TO BALANCE FUNDING PRIORITIES TO PLAN FOR THE BROADEST POSSIBLE RANGE OF OPERATIONS THAT INCLUDE HOMELAND

DEFENSE, NATURAL DISASTERS, STABILIZATION EFFORTS, COUNTERINSURGENCY AND COUNTERTERRORISM OPERATIONS, OR NATION STATE AGGRESSORS WITH GROWING SOPHISTICATION AND MILITARY MEANS. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (U.S. DOD) FACES THE SIMULTANEOUS

REQUIREMENTS TO RECAPITALIZE IMPORTANT CAPABILITIES AND TRANSFORM THE FORCE TO MEET THE CHANGING NATIONAL SECURITY AS ARTICULATED IN THE 2010 QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW. ALL OF THIS MUST BE CARRIED OUT AGAINST A BACKDROP OF SIGNIFICANT COMPETING

NATIONAL PRIORITIES INCLUDING THE ECONOMIC CRISIS AND HEALTHCARE REFORM. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT WILL REMAIN DYNAMIC AND CHALLENGING WELL INTO THIS DECADE TRENDING WITH THE THREAT ENVIRONMENT.

GOVERNMENT POLICIES ARE IMPACTING THE DEFENSE ENVIRONMENT INCLUDING DEFENSE ACQUISITION REFORM, MORE INSOURCING, CONCERNS OVER INDUSTRIAL BASE, A SHIFT IN EMPHASIS

TOWARDS MORE AFFORDABLE SOLUTIONS AND EMPHASIS ON INCREASING DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN OUR ALLIANCES.

ALTHOUGH THE U.S. DOD BUDGET

HAS GROWN SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE PAST DECADE, WE EXPECT THE TOTAL BUDGET GROWTH RATE TO LEVEL OFF OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS DUE TO SHIFTING PRIORITIES AND BUDGET PRESSURES. THE FISCAL YEAR 2010 DISCRETIONARY BUDGET REQUEST OF $660 BILLION INCLUDES

AN OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS (OCO) BUDGET OF $130 BILLION, WITH AN ADDITIONAL $33 BILLION REQUESTED.

THE FISCAL YEAR 2011 DISCRETIONARY BUDGET OF

$708 BILLION INCLUDES OCO BUDGET OF $159 BILLION. PROCUREMENT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE, WHILE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTS DECREASE, FACING INCREASING BUDGETARY PRESSURES DUE TO GROWING REQUIREMENTS FROM OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE (O&M) AND

PERSONNEL COSTS TIED TO U.S. COMMITMENTS OVERSEAS. HOWEVER, THIS TREND IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EQUIPMENT RECAPITALIZATION EFFORTS AND CONTINUED DEMAND FOR SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT. THE NEAR-TERM FORECAST OF THE DEFENSE BUDGET ENVIRONMENT SHOWS LIMITED GROWTH IN THE 2011 TO 2015 PERIOD FOR

INVESTMENT EFFORTS. THOUGH OPPORTUNITIES MAY EXIST FOLLOWING U.S. TROOP DRAW-DOWNS IN IRAQ, THEY ARE OFFSET BY RECENT INCREASES IN AFGHANISTAN. WE CONTINUE TO SEE PRESSURE TO REDUCE OCO REQUESTS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO COVER THE ONGOING COSTS OF THE

WARS.

IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE U.S. DOD WILL BE ABLE TO FULLY FUND ALL PROGRAMS OF RECORD ALREADY IN DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS NEW INITIATIVES. THIS

IMBALANCE BETWEEN FUTURE COSTS OF PROGRAMS AND EXPECTED FUNDING LEVELS IS NOT UNCOMMON IN THE U.S. DOD AND IS ROUTINELY MANAGED BY INTERNALLY ADJUSTING PRIORITIES AND SCHEDULES, RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS, AND LENGTHENING PRODUCTION RUNS TO MEET THE

CONSTRAINTS OF AVAILABLE FUNDING AND OCCASIONALLY BY CANCELLATION OF PROGRAMS. WE EXPECT THE U.S. DOD WILL RESPOND TO FUTURE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS BY FOCUSING ON AFFORDABILITY STRATEGIES FROM ACQUISITION REFORM AND EMPHASIZING UTILIZATION OF COMMERCIAL

OFF-THE-SHELF SOLUTIONS AND NETWORK-ENABLED OPERATIONS. THESE STRATEGIES WILL BE ENABLED THROUGH PERSISTENT INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE (ISR), LONG-RANGE STRIKE, SPECIAL OPERATIONS, UNMANNED SYSTEMS, CYBER SECURITY, AND

PRECISION-GUIDED KINETIC AND NON-KINETIC WEAPONS, ELECTRONIC WARFARE, AS WELL AS SELECTED OUTSOURCING OF LOGISTICS AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS WHILE MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER COSTS.

OTHER NATIONS CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE GROWING DEMANDS FOR NEW EQUIPMENT TO ADDRESS OPERATIONAL REQUIREMENTS, AGING INVENTORIES, AND CHANGING THREAT ENVIRONMENTS.

GREATER U.S. RELIANCE ON ALLIES AND COALITION PARTNERS PLACES ADDITIONAL PRESSURE ON NATIONS TO EMPHASIZE ACQUISITION OF MATERIAL THAT IS DEPLOYABLE, SURVIVABLE, AND INTEROPERABLE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY. EUROPEAN NATIONS ARE STRUGGLING TO

MEET DEFENSE INVESTMENT NEEDS AS BUDGET DEFICITS CREATE GREATER PRESSURE ON RESOURCES. THOUGH REGIONAL FINANCIAL CONCERNS EXIST, MIDDLE EASTERN MILITARY MARKETS REMAIN ROBUST WITH STABLE OIL PRICES AND PERSISTENT REGIONAL SECURITY CONCERNS

SUSTAINING CONTINUED DEFENSE INVESTMENT. IN ASIA, GROWTH IS SLOWING WITH NATIONS PURSUING SELECT ACQUISITIONS TO ADDRESS GROWING REGIONAL THREATS. THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTED BY GLOBAL ECONOMIC CHALLENGES. HOWEVER, THE

CONTINUING THREAT ENVIRONMENT SHOULD KEEP DEMAND STABLE IN 2010.

MISSILE DEFENSE ENVIRONMENT

THE PROLIFERATION OF SHORT- AND MEDIUM-RANGE

BALLISTIC MISSILES IS CONSIDERED THE GREATEST CURRENT THREAT TO SECURITY AND IS DRIVING MISSILE DEFENSE SPENDING. AS A RESULT, THE NEAR-TERM FOCUS FOR GROWTH IS IN REGIONAL AND TACTICAL BMD SYSTEMS.

CIVIL SPACE TRANSPORTATION AND EXPLORATION ENVIRONMENT

THE NATIONAL AERONAUTICS AND SPACE ADMINISTRATION (NASA) BUDGET IS FOCUSED ON TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENT AND

DEMONSTRATION PROGRAMS, THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, AND NEW INITIATIVES ASSOCIATED WITH SPACE EXPLORATION. NASA IS DEVELOPING NEW APPROACHES TO SPACE EXPLORATION WITH ADDED EMPHASIS ON COMMERCIAL SPACEFLIGHT SYSTEMS, SPACE TECHNOLOGY

DEVELOPMENT AND ROBOTIC MISSIONS. NASA IS ALSO ENHANCING ITS FOCUS ON CLIMATE CHANGE AND AERONAUTICS RESEARCH.

HOMELAND SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

THE

CONTINUING THREAT FROM TERRORISM IS THE KEY DRIVER FOR THE HOMELAND SECURITY MARKET. KEY GROWTH AREAS INCLUDE AVIATION SECURITY, BORDER SECURITY, MARITIME SECURITY AND CYBER SECURITY. ADDITIONALLY, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS FOCUSED ON INCREASING

COOPERATION WITH STATE AND LOCAL INSTITUTIONS.

COMMERCIAL SATELLITE ENVIRONMENT

THE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE MARKET IS EXPERIENCING IMPROVEMENT IN

MARKET DEMAND, PARTLY DRIVEN BY STRONG U.S. GOVERNMENT DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL SATELLITE SYSTEMS AND SERVICES, BUT THE OVERALL SECTOR CONTINUES TO BE CHARACTERIZED BY OVERCAPACITY CREATING STRONG COMPETITIVE PRESSURES ON PRICING.

ADJACENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT

WE SEE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES ACROSS A NUMBER OF ADJACENT MARKETS WITH BOTH U.S. DOD AND OTHER U.S. GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS. THESE

MARKETS, INCLUDING SERVICES, UNMANNED SYSTEMS, INTELLIGENCE, CYBER, AND ENERGY, REPRESENT KEY DEVELOPMENT AREAS WHICH SUPPORT THE CURRENT ENGAGEMENTS OVERSEAS AS WELL AS EMERGING NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES.

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SERVICES

GROWTH IN SERVICES IS ANTICIPATED BOTH DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY, AS CUSTOMERS HAVE A WIDE

VARIETY OF NEEDS, INCLUDING INFORMATION SERVICES, PLATFORM-RELATED SERVICES, FACILITY MANAGEMENT, INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES AND LOGISTICS COMMAND AND CONTROL.

UNMANNED SYSTEMS

THE UNMANNED MARKET CONTINUES TO SEE GROWTH IN ALL CLASSES OF PLATFORMS DUE TO THE HIGH DEMAND FROM THE U.S. MILITARY IN SOUTHWEST ASIA. WE ANTICIPATE THIS GROWTH INCREASING AS UNMANNED SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO PROVIDE

CRITICAL MISSION FUNCTIONS TO THE WAR FIGHTER WITH AFFORDABILITY, PERSISTENCE, AND ACCURACY.

INTELLIGENCE

WE SEE THE INTELLIGENCE MARKET GROWING

BASED ON THE DEMANDS OF DATA COLLECTION, DISSEMINATION, AND ANALYSIS DRIVEN BY THE CONFLICTS IN SOUTHWEST ASIA. GROWTH IN DATA FUSION, DATA MANAGEMENT, AND INFORMATION SHARING IS EXPECTED AS THE USE OF ISR ASSETS INCREASE.

CYBER

THE DEMAND FOR DEFENSIVE, OFFENSIVE, AND EXPLOIT OPERATIONS IN THE EMERGING CYBER MARKET PROVIDES UNIQUE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AS EXPLICIT NEEDS ARE

FURTHER DEFINED BY CUSTOMERS. CYBER THREATS FROM BOTH STATE AND NON-STATE ACTORS REPRESENT A CRITICAL NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUE. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS TAKING SIGNIFICANT STEPS TO MITIGATE THE CYBER THREAT TO THE U.S. DOD AND TO U.S. CRITICAL

INFRASTRUCTURE.

ENERGY

WE ANTICIPATE THE ENERGY MARKET WILL EMERGE WITH GROWTH POTENTIAL. AS ENERGY VOLATILITY BECOMES MORE SUBSTANTIAL, THE

NEED FOR ENERGY MANAGEMENT, INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY, AND SCENARIO MODELING WILL INCREASE ACCORDINGLY. THE U.S. DOD, INCLUDING INDIVIDUAL SERVICE BRANCHES, IS ALSO ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN DEVELOPING ENERGY POLICY GUIDANCE AND COMPREHENSIVE PLANS FROM

WHICH TO EXECUTE PROGRAMS.

BDS REALIGNMENT

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, 2008 AND 2007 CERTAIN PROGRAMS WERE REALIGNED AMONG BDS SEGMENTS. IN ADDITION, EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2008, CERTAIN ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION CONTRACTS (FORMERLY INCLUDED IN N&SS) WERE TRANSFERRED

TO THE OTHER SEGMENT. BUSINESS SEGMENT DATA FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED HAVE BEEN ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THE REALIGNMENT. SEE NOTE 21.

BDS REVENUES INCREASED BY $1,614 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED TO 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES IN

GS&S AND BMA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN N&SS. BDS REVENUES WERE UNCHANGED IN 2008 COMPARED TO 2007 AS REVENUE GROWTH IN GS&S WAS OFFSET BY DECREASES IN BMA AND N&SS.

OPERATING EARNINGS

BDS OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2009 INCREASED BY $67 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EARNINGS IN THE BMA SEGMENT, PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY LOWER EARNINGS IN THE N&SS SEGMENT. BDS EARNINGS DECREASED BY $208 MILLION IN 2008 COMPARED WITH 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER EARNINGS IN THE BMA SEGMENT RESULTING FROM A $248 MILLION CHARGE TAKEN ON THE AEW&C PROGRAM IN THE SECOND

QUARTER PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER EARNINGS IN THE N&SS SEGMENT.

BACKLOG

TOTAL BACKLOG IS COMPRISED OF CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG, WHICH REPRESENTS

WORK WE ARE ON CONTRACT TO PERFORM FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING, AND UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG, WHICH REPRESENTS WORK WE ARE ON CONTRACT TO PERFORM FOR WHICH FUNDING HAS NOT YET BEEN AUTHORIZED AND APPROPRIATED. BDS TOTAL BACKLOG DECREASED 11% IN

2009, FROM $73,004 MILLION TO $64,839 MILLION, PARTLY DUE TO A PARTIAL TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE FROM THE U.S. ARMY OF THE BCTM (FORMERLY FCS) SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION CONTRACT RELATING TO MANNED GROUND VEHICLES AND ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS

AND EQUIPMENT. CURRENT YEAR DELIVERIES AND SALES ON MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS AWARDED IN PRIOR YEARS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE BACKLOG REDUCTION.

FOR FURTHER

DETAILS ON THE CHANGES BETWEEN PERIODS, REFER TO THE DISCUSSIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS BELOW.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

OUR BUSINESS INCLUDES A VARIETY OF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE COMPLEX DESIGN AND TECHNICAL CHALLENGES. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE COST-TYPE CONTRACTING

ARRANGEMENTS. IN THESE CASES THE ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL RISKS ARE PRIMARILY IN LOWER PROFIT RATES OR PROGRAM CANCELLATION IF MILESTONES AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS ARE NOT ACCOMPLISHED. EXAMPLES OF THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE AIRBORNE LASER, EA-18G, FAMILY OF

BEYOND LINE-OF-SIGHT TERMINALS (FAB-T), BCTM (FORMERLY FCS), GMD, JOINT TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEM (JTRS), P-8A AND PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS.

SOME OF OUR

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE CONTRACTED ON A FIXED-PRICE BASIS. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE HIGHLY COMPLEX DESIGNS. AS TECHNICAL OR QUALITY ISSUES ARISE, WE MAY EXPERIENCE SCHEDULE DELAYS AND COST IMPACTS, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR ESTIMATED COST TO

PERFORM THE WORK OR REDUCE OUR ESTIMATED PRICE, EITHER OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHARGE. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ONGOING, AND WHILE WE BELIEVE THE COST AND FEE ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE, THE TECHNICAL

COMPLEXITY OF THESE PROGRAMS CREATES FINANCIAL RISK AS ADDITIONAL COMPLETION COSTS MAY BECOME NECESSARY OR SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES COULD BE EXTENDED, WHICH COULD TRIGGER TERMINATION PROVISIONS, THE LOSS OF SATELLITE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS, OR

OTHER FINANCIALLY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE RISK FOR REACH-FORWARD LOSSES IF OUR ESTIMATED COSTS EXCEED OUR ESTIMATED CONTRACT REVENUES. EXAMPLES OF THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE AEW&C, INTERNATIONAL KC-767 TANKER, COMMERCIAL AND

MILITARY SATELLITES, VIGILARE AND HIGH FREQUENCY MODERNISATION.

REVENUES

BMA REVENUES INCREASED 6% IN 2009 AND DECREASED 1% IN 2008. THE INCREASE OF $746 MILLION IN

2009 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER DELIVERIES AND VOLUME ON THE APACHE, V-22 AND CHINOOK ROTORCRAFT PROGRAMS AND THE F-18 AND PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER VOLUME ON THE F-22 AND SEVERAL WEAPONS PROGRAMS. THE DECREASE OF $188 MILLION IN

2008 IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY LOWER F-22, APACHE, F-18 AND CHINOOK REVENUE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED DELIVERIES ON F-15 AND INTERNATIONAL KC-767 TANKER AND C-17 CONTRACT MIX.

DELIVERIES OF NEW-BUILD PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT, EXCLUDING REMANUFACTURES AND MODIFICATIONS, WERE AS FOLLOWS.

OPERATING EARNINGS

BMA OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED BY $236 MILLION IN 2009 PARTLY DUE TO HIGHER

DELIVERIES ON SEVERAL PROGRAMS AND VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A CHANGE IN DELIVERY MIX. OPERATING EARNINGS IN BOTH YEARS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHARGES ON THE AEW&C AND INTERNATIONAL KC-767 TANKER PROGRAMS. BMA EARNINGS DECREASED BY $330

MILLION IN 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO CHARGES TAKEN ON THE AEW&C PROGRAM. DELIVERY MIX AND LOWER VOLUME ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE DECREASE IN 2008.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE BMA SEGMENT CONTINUES TO FOCUS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO LEVERAGE CUSTOMER KNOWLEDGE, TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND SYSTEM INTEGRATION OF MANNED AND UNMANNED SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE INNOVATIVE

SOLUTIONS TO MEET THE WARFIGHTERS ENDURING NEEDS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN 2009 INCREASED BY 13% OVER 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTERNATIONAL TANKER DEVELOPMENT COSTS. RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES UTILIZE OUR CAPABILITIES IN ARCHITECTURES, SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND WEAPON SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE OUR CUSTOMERS CAPABILITIES IN THE AREAS OF MOBILITY,

PRECISION EFFECTS, SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND SURVIVABILITY. INVESTMENTS IN PROTOTYPING ALLOW US TO OFFER LOW-RISK PROGRAMS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. THE PRODUCTS OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT BOTH NEW MANNED AND UNMANNED SYSTEMS AS WELL AS

ENHANCED VERSIONS OF EXISTING FIELDED PRODUCTS. INVESTMENTS SUPPORT VERTICAL INTEGRATION OF OUR PRODUCT LINE IN

32

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AREAS LIKE AUTONOMOUS OPERATION OF UNMANNED VEHICLES, ADVANCED SENSORS AND ELECTRONIC WARFARE. THESE EFFORTS FOCUS ON INCREASING MISSION EFFECTIVENESS, INTEROPERABILITY, RELIABILITY AND REDUCING

THE COST OF OWNERSHIP.

BACKLOG

BMA TOTAL BACKLOG IN 2009 WAS VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED FROM 2008. BACKLOG INCREASES DUE TO 2009 CURRENT YEAR ORDERS

FOR C-17, P-8 INDIA AND CHINOOK AIRCRAFT WERE OFFSET BY REVENUES RECOGNIZED ON MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS RECEIVED IN PRIOR YEARS WITH THE LARGEST DECREASE IN THE F/A-18 PROGRAM. TOTAL BACKLOG INCREASED BY 13% IN 2008 COMPARED WITH 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO

AN INCREASE IN THE V-22, CHINOOK AND F-15 PROGRAM BACKLOG. THESE INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DELIVERIES AND SALES ON MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS AWARDED IN PRIOR YEARS WITH THE LARGEST DECREASES IN THE C-17 AND F/A-18 PROGRAMS.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

ITEMS WHICH COULD HAVE A FUTURE

IMPACT ON BMA OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

AEW&C

DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007, WE RECORDED CHARGES INCREASING THE REACH-FORWARD LOSSES ON

THE AEW&C PROGRAMS IN AUSTRALIA AND TURKEY BY $133 MILLION, $308 MILLION AND $81 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2009 CHARGE PRIMARILY RELATED TO DELIVERY SCHEDULE DELAYS. THE 2008 CHARGE, PRIMARILY RELATED TO OUR PROGRAM IN AUSTRALIA, WAS DUE TO

SUBSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT ISSUES ON THE ELECTRONIC WARFARE AND GROUND SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND THE ADDITIONAL TIME REQUIRED FOR INTEGRATION TESTING. THE AEW&C DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, ALSO KNOWN AS WEDGETAIL IN AUSTRALIA, PEACE EAGLE IN TURKEY AND PEACE EYE

IN THE REPUBLIC OF KOREA, CONSISTS OF 737-700 AIRCRAFT OUTFITTED WITH A VARIETY OF COMMAND AND CONTROL AND ADVANCED RADAR SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN INSTALLED ON AN AIRPLANE BEFORE. WEDGETAIL INCLUDES SIX AIRCRAFT AND PEACE EAGLE AND

PEACE EYE INCLUDE FOUR AIRCRAFT EACH. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2009, TWO WEDGETAIL AIRCRAFT WERE PROVIDED TO AUSTRALIA FOR FAMILIARIZATION AND TRAINING. WEDGETAIL FINAL DELIVERY AND CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN LATE 2010 AND

EXTEND THROUGH THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2011. THESE ARE ADVANCED AND COMPLEX FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS INVOLVING TECHNICAL CHALLENGES AT THE INDIVIDUAL SUBSYSTEM LEVEL AND IN THE OVERALL INTEGRATION OF THESE SUBSYSTEMS INTO A RELIABLE AND

EFFECTIVE OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST AND REVENUE ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE; HOWEVER, THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF THE PROGRAMS CREATES FINANCIAL RISK AS ADDITIONAL COMPLETION COSTS MAY BE

NECESSARY OR SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES COULD BE DELAYED.

INTERNATIONAL KC-767 TANKER PROGRAM

DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007, WE RECORDED CHARGES

INCREASING THE REACH-FORWARD LOSSES IN THE INTERNATIONAL KC-767 TANKER PROGRAMS BY $78 MILLION, $85 MILLION AND $152 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2007 CHARGE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET AT THE CONSOLIDATED LEVEL. THE INTERNATIONAL KC-767 TANKER PROGRAM

INCLUDES FOUR AIRCRAFT FOR THE ITALIAN AIR FORCE AND FOUR AIRCRAFT FOR THE JAPANESE AIR SELF DEFENSE FORCE. THE FINAL DELIVERY TO JAPAN WAS MADE IN DECEMBER 2009. THE ITALIAN INTERNATIONAL KC-767 PROGRAM IS ONGOING, AND WHILE WE BELIEVE THE REVENUE

AND COST ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE, THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF THE PROGRAM CREATES FINANCIAL RISK AS ADDITIONAL COMPLETION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS MAY BE NECESSARY OR REMAINING SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES COULD

BE DELAYED.

REVENUES

N&SS REVENUES DECREASED 4% IN 2009 AND 1% IN 2008. N&SS REVENUES ARE EXPECTED TO

DECREASE IN 2010, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES ON THE BCTM AND GMD PROGRAMS. THE DECREASE OF $469 MILLION IN 2009 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER VOLUME ON THE GMD, INTELLIGENCE AND SECURITY SYSTEMS, AND PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS, PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

VOLUME ON SEVERAL SATELLITE PROGRAMS. THE DECREASE OF $135 MILLION IN 2008 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED REVENUES IN BCTM (FORMERLY FCS), PROPRIETARY AND SATELLITE PROGRAMS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED REVENUES IN THE SBINET PROGRAM.

OPERATING EARNINGS

N&SS OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED BY $195 MILLION IN 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER

REVENUES AND CHARGES RELATED TO THE SEA LAUNCH BANKRUPTCY. EARNINGS IN 2009 WERE ALSO REDUCED BY CHARGES RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF A SATELLITE CONTRACT DISPUTE AND INDEMNIFICATION OF DELTA II INVENTORY. EARNINGS IN 2008 INCLUDED A FAVORABLE

SETTLEMENT ON A CIVIL SATELLITE PROGRAM. N&SS EARNINGS INCREASED BY $171 MILLION IN 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED EARNINGS FROM OUR INVESTMENT IN UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE (ULA). N&SS OPERATING EARNINGS INCLUDE EQUITY EARNINGS OF $164

MILLION, $178 MILLION AND $74 MILLION FROM THE UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE JOINT VENTURE AND THE ULA JOINT VENTURE IN 2009, 2008, AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE N&SS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING REMAINS FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, COMMAND AND CONTROL, COMPUTERS, INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE AND RECONNAISSANCE SYSTEMS (C4ISR); THAT SUPPORT

A NETWORK-ENABLED ARCHITECTURE APPROACH FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ARE INVESTING IN CAPABILITIES TO ENHANCE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN EXISTING AND NEW AIR/GROUND AND MARITIME PLATFORMS, TO INCREASE COMMUNICATIONS AVAILABILITY, UTILITY AND BANDWIDTH THROUGH

MORE ROBUST SPACE SYSTEMS, AND TO LEVERAGE INNOVATIVE NETWORKING AND ISR CONCEPTS. KEY PROGRAMS IN THIS AREA INCLUDE BCTM, JTRS, WIDEBAND GLOBAL SATELLITE SYSTEM ARES, FAB-T AND SBINET. INVESTMENTS WERE ALSO MADE

TO DEVELOP CONCEPTS AND CAPABILITIES RELATED TO CYBER AND SECURITY PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEXT-GENERATION SPACE AND INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS. ALONG WITH INCREASED FUNDING TO SUPPORT THESE NETWORK-ENABLED

CAPABILITIES, WE ALSO MAINTAINED OUR INVESTMENT LEVELS IN MISSILE DEFENSE, DIRECTED ENERGY AND ADVANCED EXPLORATION SYSTEMS.

BACKLOG

N&SS

TOTAL BACKLOG DECREASED BY 34% IN 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008 PARTLY DUE TO THE PARTIAL TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE FROM THE U.S. ARMY OF THE BCTM (FORMERLY FCS) SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION CONTRACT RELATED TO MANNED GROUND VEHICLES AND

ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT. CURRENT YEAR DELIVERIES AND SALES ON MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS AWARDED IN PRIOR YEARS INCLUDING BCTM,

34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GMD, AND PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE BACKLOG REDUCTION. TOTAL BACKLOG DECREASED BY 12% IN 2008 COMPARED WITH 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO REVENUES RECOGNIZED ON MULTI-YEAR ORDERS

RECEIVED IN PRIOR YEARS ON BCTM, GMD AND C3 PROGRAMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION PROGRAM.

ADDITIONAL

CONSIDERATIONS

ITEMS WHICH COULD HAVE A FUTURE IMPACT ON N&SS OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE

ON DECEMBER 1, 2006, WE AND LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION (LOCKHEED) CREATED A 50/50 JOINT VENTURE NAMED UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE

L.L.C. ULA COMBINES THE PRODUCTION, ENGINEERING, TEST AND LAUNCH OPERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES OF BOEING DELTA AND LOCKHEED ATLAS ROCKETS. WE INITIALLY CONTRIBUTED NET ASSETS OF $914 MILLION AT DECEMBER 1, 2006. THE BOOK

VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT EXCEEDED OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ULAS NET ASSETS. THIS DIFFERENCE IS EXPENSED RATABLY IN FUTURE YEARS. BASED ON THE ADJUSTED CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE CONFORMED ACCOUNTING POLICIES ESTABLISHED BY ULA, THIS AMORTIZATION

IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION ANNUALLY FOR THE NEXT 15 YEARS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FORMATION OF ULA, WE AND LOCKHEED EACH HAVE AGREED

TO EXTEND A LINE OF CREDIT TO ULA OF UP TO $200 MILLION TO SUPPORT ITS WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DURING THE 5 YEAR PERIOD FOLLOWING DECEMBER 1, 2006. WE AND LOCKHEED TRANSFERRED PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN U.S. GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS TO ULA AS OF THE CLOSING DATE. WE AND LOCKHEED AGREED TO JOINTLY GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE CONTRACTS TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. WE AND LOCKHEED HAVE ALSO EACH COMMITTED TO PROVIDE ULA WITH UP TO $122 MILLION OF

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE EVENT ULA DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO MAKE A REQUIRED PAYMENT TO US UNDER AN INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT. SEE NOTE 7.

WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ULA THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2020 AGAINST POTENTIAL NON-RECOVERABILITY AND NON-ALLOWABILITY OF $1,360 MILLION OF BOEING DELTA INVENTORIES INCLUDED IN CONTRIBUTED ASSETS PLUS $1,860 MILLION

OF INVENTORY SUBJECT TO AN INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT WHICH ENDS ON MARCH 31, 2021. SINCE INCEPTION, ULA HAS CONSUMED $1,111 MILLION OF INVENTORIES THAT WERE CONTRIBUTED BY US AND HAS MADE PAYMENTS OF $120 MILLION TO US UNDER THE INVENTORY

SUPPLY AGREEMENT. AS PART OF ITS INTEGRATION, ULA IS CONTINUING TO ASSESS THE FUTURE OF THE DELTA II PROGRAM BEYOND WHAT IS CURRENTLY ON CONTRACT. IN THE EVENT ULA IS UNABLE TO SELL ADDITIONAL DELTA II INVENTORY, EARNINGS COULD BE REDUCED BY UP TO

$62 MILLION.

WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ULA AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT ULA MAY INCUR IN THE EVENT ULA IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CONTRACT

PRICING FROM THE U.S. AIR FORCE (USAF) FOR FOUR SATELLITE MISSIONS. WE BELIEVE ULA IS ENTITLED TO ADDITIONAL CONTRACT PRICING. IN DECEMBER 2008, ULA SUBMITTED A CLAIM TO THE USAF TO RE-PRICE THE CONTRACT VALUE FOR TWO OF THE FOUR SATELLITE MISSIONS

COVERED BY THE INDEMNIFICATION. IN MARCH 2009, THE USAF ISSUED A DENIAL OF THAT CLAIM AND IN JUNE 2009, ULA FILED AN APPEAL. DURING 2009, THE USAF EXERCISED ITS OPTION FOR A THIRD SATELLITE MISSION. ULA INTENDS TO SUBMIT A CLAIM TO THE USAF IN 2010

TO RE-PRICE THE CONTRACT VALUE OF THE THIRD MISSION. IF ULA IS UNSUCCESSFUL OBTAINING ADDITIONAL PRICING WE MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME OF THE SHORTFALL AND MAY RECORD UP TO $382 MILLION IN PRE-TAX LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOUR MISSIONS.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

DURING 2009, WE RECEIVED A PARTIAL TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE FROM THE U.S. ARMY OF THE BCTM (FORMERLY

FCS) SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION CONTRACT RELATING TO MANNED GROUND VEHICLES AND ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT. WE BELIEVE THE FINAL RESTRUCTURED BCTM CONTRACT WILL NEGATIVELY IMPACT REVENUE AND EARNINGS IN THE N&SS SEGMENT

GOING FORWARD. IN ADDITION, WE COMPLETED THE TSAT RISK REDUCTION AND SYSTEM DEFINITION CONTRACT IN JULY 2009 AND DO NOT ANTICIPATE A FUTURE TSAT SPACE SEGMENT PROGRAM COMPETITION. AS A RESULT OF LOWER THAN ANTICIPATED REVENUE AND EARNINGS, WE

TESTED N&SS GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT DURING 2009. NO

IMPAIRMENT WAS INDICATED BY OUR TESTS. FUTURE RECOMMENDED BUDGETARY CHANGES, IF APPROVED BY CONGRESS, OR ADDITIONAL PARTIAL TERMINATIONS, COULD FURTHER IMPACT N&SS PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE

RECOVERABILITY OF GOODWILL.

REVENUES

GS&S REVENUES INCREASED $1,337 MILLION IN 2009 AND $318 MILLION IN 2008, AN INCREASE OF 18%

AND 4%. THE 2009 INCREASE WAS DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME IN THE INTEGRATED LOGISTICS (IL), AND THE TRAINING SYSTEMS AND SERVICES (TS&S) DIVISIONS. THE 2008 INCREASE WAS DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES IN THE TS&S AND IL DIVISIONS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

DECREASES IN INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAM VOLUME.

OPERATING EARNINGS

GS&S OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED 3% IN 2009 AS ADDITIONAL EARNINGS

FROM INCREASED VOLUME WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARGINS DUE TO CONTRACT ADJUSTMENTS AND CHANGES IN CONTRACT MIX. OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED BY 5% IN 2008 DUE TO CHANGES IN THE CONTRACT MIX AND DISPOSITION OF CONTRACT MATTERS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

GS&S CONTINUES TO FOCUS INVESTMENT STRATEGIES ON ITS CORE BUSINESSES INCLUDING IL, MAINTENANCE MODIFICATIONS AND UPGRADES

(MM&U) AND TS&S, AS WELL AS ON MOVING INTO NEW MARKET AREAS OF LOGISTICS COMMAND AND CONTROL (LOG C2) AND ENERGY MANAGEMENT IN ADVANCED GLOBAL SERVICES AND SUPPORT. INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT AND

IMPLEMENTATION OF INNOVATIVE TOOLS, PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS AS MARKET DISCRIMINATORS IN THE DELIVERY OF INTEGRATED CUSTOMER SOLUTIONS. EXAMPLES OF SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS STEMMING FROM THESE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES INCLUDE THE C-17 GLOBEMASTER SUSTAINMENT

PARTNERSHIP, THE F/A-18 INTEGRATED READINESS SUPPORT TEAMING PROGRAM, THE F-15 SINGAPORE PERFORMANCE-BASED LOGISTICS CONTRACT, AND SMART GRID PROJECTS. SUCCESSFUL DEVELOPMENT OF ADAPTABLE SYSTEMS HAS ALLOWED GS&S TO TRANSITION FROM BOEING

PLATFORMS AND INTO THE BROADER AVIATION MARKET. BEYOND AEROSPACE, GS&S CAPABILITIES HAVE CREATED OPPORTUNITIES IN ADJACENCIES AND NEW MARKETS EXEMPLIFIED IN 2009 THROUGH ENTRANCE INTO THE LAND VEHICLE SUPPORT, ENERGY

SOLUTIONS, AND LOGISTICS INFORMATION SYSTEMS MARKETS.

BACKLOG

GS&S TOTAL BACKLOG INCREASED BY 8% IN 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008 DUE TO

SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT AND DEFENSE AND GOVERNMENT SERVICES PROGRAMS AND PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN THE IL AND MM&U DIVISIONS. TOTAL BACKLOG INCREASED 6% IN 2008 COMPARED WITH 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASES IN IL AND

INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS.

BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

BCCS CUSTOMER FINANCING AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31,

2009 TOTALED $5,666 MILLION, WHICH WAS SUBSTANTIALLY COLLATERALIZED BY BOEING PRODUCED COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BCCS PORTFOLIO IS CONCENTRATED AMONG U.S. COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS.

THE WEAK GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND CAPITAL MARKET DISRUPTIONS AFFECTED THE AVAILABILITY OF CREDIT FOR THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. WHILE SOURCES OF FINANCING AVAILABLE

FOR AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES IMPROVED DURING 2009, BCC PROVIDED LIMITED FINANCING TO CERTAIN BOEING CUSTOMERS. TO THE EXTENT CAPITAL MARKET CONDITIONS CONTINUE TO IMPROVE, WE BELIEVE THE OVERALL AIRCRAFT FINANCING MARKET SHOULD IMPROVE AS WELL AND LESSEN

THE NEED FOR BCC TO PROVIDE FINANCING.

AIRCRAFT VALUES AND LEASE RATES ARE IMPACTED BY THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF AIRCRAFT THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUT OF

SERVICE. APPROXIMATELY 2,400 WESTERN-BUILT COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT (11.6% OF CURRENT WORLD FLEET) WERE PARKED AS OF DECEMBER 2009, INCLUDING BOTH IN-PRODUCTION AND OUT-OF-PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT TYPES. OVER 36% OF THE PARKED AIRCRAFT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO

RETURN TO SERVICE. IN DECEMBER 2008 AND 2007, 11.0% AND 8.2% OF THE WESTERN-BUILT COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT WERE PARKED. AIRCRAFT VALUATIONS COULD DECLINE IF SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF AIRCRAFT, PARTICULARLY TYPES WITH RELATIVELY FEW OPERATORS, ARE PLACED

OUT OF SERVICE.

REVENUES

BCC SEGMENT REVENUES CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF LEASE INCOME FROM EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASE AND INTEREST FROM FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND NOTES. BCCS REVENUES DECREASED $43 MILLION IN 2009, RESULTING FROM LOWER OPERATING LEASE INCOME

RESULTING FROM A SMALLER PORTFOLIO OF EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES AS A RESULT OF AIRCRAFT RETURNS AND ASSET DISPOSITIONS. BCCS REVENUES DECREASED $112 MILLION IN 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER INTEREST INCOME ON NOTES RECEIVABLE AND LOWER

INVESTMENT INCOME.

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS

BCCS OPERATING EARNINGS ARE PRESENTED NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE, PROVISION FOR (RECOVERY OF) LOSSES, ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION ON LEASED EQUIPMENT AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED BY $36 MILLION IN

2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES, HIGHER IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE AND A PROVISION FOR LOSSES PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN AIRCRAFT COLLATERAL VALUES AND REDUCED PROJECTED CASH FLOWS FOR CERTAIN AIRCRAFT. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2008

COMPARED WITH 2007 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES.

OPERATING ACTIVITIES

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $6,004 MILLION TO $5,603

MILLION DURING 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008. THE IMPROVEMENT REFLECTS A REDUCTION IN WORKING CAPITAL DUE TO THE INVENTORY THAT WAS BUILT UP DURING THE 2008 IAM STRIKE WHICH WAS DELIVERED IN 2009, OFFSET BY THE CONTINUED RAMP UP OF THE 787 PROGRAM DURING

2009. WE EXPECT OPERATING CASH FLOWS TO BE LOWER IN 2010 AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD INVENTORIES PRIOR TO DELIVERIES OF THE 787 AND 747-8 AIRPLANES. WE CONTRIBUTED 29,211,295 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK WITH AN AGGREGATE VALUE OF $1.5 BILLION TO OUR

PENSION PLANS IN NOVEMBER 2009. CASH CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLANS TOTALED $82 MILLION AND $531 MILLION IN 2009 AND 2008.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $3,794 MILLION DURING 2009 COMPARED WITH $1,888 MILLION PROVIDED DURING 2008. THE $5,682 MILLION YEAR-OVER-YEAR CHANGE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO CHANGES IN INVESTMENTS IN TIME DEPOSITS AND DEBT SECURITIES. IN

2008 WE RECEIVED NET PROCEEDS OF $4,670 MILLION FROM LIQUIDATING INVESTMENTS. IN 2009, WE MADE NET CONTRIBUTIONS OF $1,588 MILLION TO INVESTMENTS. IN 2009, OTHER INVESTING OUTLAYS INCLUDED $639 MILLION FOR ACQUISITIONS AND $448 MILLION TO SATISFY

GUARANTEES OF SEA LAUNCH INDEBTEDNESS, WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $40 MILLION REIMBURSEMENT. THESE CASH OUTLAYS WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY $488 MILLION OF LOWER CAPITAL SPENDING ON PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ADDITIONS IN 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008.

WE EXPECT CAPITAL SPENDING IN 2010 TO BE HIGHER THAN 2009 DUE TO THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SECOND 787 FINAL ASSEMBLY LINE IN NORTH CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

CASH PROVIDED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $4,094 MILLION DURING 2009 COMPARED WITH $5,202 MILLION USED DURING 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO PROCEEDS FROM BORROWINGS OF $5,961 MILLION IN 2009 AND REDUCTIONS IN SHARE

REPURCHASES IN 2009.

ON MARCH 13, 2009, WE ISSUED NOTES TOTALING $1,850 MILLION, ON JULY 28, 2009, WE ISSUED NOTES TOTALING $1,950 MILLION,

AND ON NOVEMBER 20, 2009, WE ISSUED NOTES TOTALING $1,200 MILLION. ON OCTOBER 27, 2009, BCC ISSUED NOTES TOTALING $1,000 MILLION.

IN 2009, WE

REPAID $551 MILLION OF DEBT, INCLUDING $528 MILLION OF DEBT HELD AT BCC. IN 2008, WE REPAID $738 MILLION OF DEBT, INCLUDING $709 MILLION OF DEBT HELD AT BCC. IN 2007, WE REPAID $1,406 MILLION OF DEBT, INCLUDING $1,309 MILLION OF DEBT HELD AT BCC.

THERE WERE NO MATERIAL DEBT ISSUANCES DURING 2008 OR 2007. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE RECORDED BALANCE OF DEBT WAS $12,924 MILLION AND $7,512 MILLION, OF WHICH $707 MILLION AND $560 MILLION WERE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM. THIS INCLUDES

$4,075 MILLION AND $3,652 MILLION OF DEBT RECORDED AT BCC, OF WHICH $659 MILLION AND $528 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 2009, WE REPURCHASED 1,173,152 SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $42.94 IN OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM

AND 477,176 SHARES TRANSFERRED TO US FROM EMPLOYEES IN SATISFACTION OF MINIMUM TAX WITHHOLDING OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VESTING OF RESTRICTED STOCK DURING THE PERIOD. DURING 2008, WE REPURCHASED 42,073,885 SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $69.79

IN OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, 1,462,776 SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $64.95 AS PART OF THE SHAREVALUE TRUST DISTRIBUTION, AND 74,824 SHARES IN STOCK SWAPS. DURING 2007, WE REPURCHASED 28,995,599 SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $95.68

IN OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND 28,432 SHARES IN STOCK SWAPS. SHARE REPURCHASE ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN AT A MINIMAL LEVEL IN 2010.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL

BORROWING CAPACITY. ANY FUTURE BORROWINGS MAY AFFECT OUR CREDIT RATINGS AND ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS DEBT COVENANTS. WE AND BCC HAVE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT CONTINUE TO SERVE AS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL SOURCES OF SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY. THROUGHOUT

2009 AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, NEITHER WE NOR BCC HAD ANY COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE $3,525 MILLION ($1,500 MILLION EXCLUSIVELY AVAILABLE FOR BCC) OF UNUSED BORROWING ON REVOLVING CREDIT LINE AGREEMENTS, OF

WHICH $2,000 MILLION IS A 5-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY EXPIRING IN NOVEMBER 2012 AND $1,525 MILLION IS A 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY EXPIRING IN NOVEMBER 2010. BOTH THE 5-YEAR AND 364-DAY CREDIT FACILITIES HAVE A ONE-YEAR TERM OUT OPTION WHICH

ALLOWS US TO EXTEND THE MATURITY OF ANY BORROWINGS ONE YEAR BEYOND THE AFOREMENTIONED EXPIRATION DATES. IN 2009, WE RENEWED THE 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, OF WHICH $500 MILLION IS ALLOCATED TO BCC. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THESE CREDIT LINES WILL

PRIMARILY SERVE AS BACKUP LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT POSSIBLE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS IN 2010. ON MARCH 9, 2009, WE FILED A PUBLIC SHELF REGISTRATION WITH THE U.S. SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION FOR THE ISSUANCE OF AN INDETERMINATE AMOUNT OF

DEBT SECURITIES AND COMMON STOCK.

IN THE EVENT WE REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT STRATEGIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

FINANCING COMMITMENTS, UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES, OR OTHER BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS, WE EXPECT TO MEET INCREASED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS BY ISSUING COMMERCIAL PAPER OR TERM DEBT. WE BELIEVE OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS EXTERNAL CAPITAL

RESOURCES SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY EXISTING SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS AND PLANS, AND ALSO TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF POTENTIAL STRATEGIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD THEY ARISE WITHIN THE NEXT

YEAR. AT THIS POINT IN TIME, OUR ACCESS TO LIQUIDITY SOURCES HAS NOT BEEN MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY THE CURRENT CREDIT ENVIRONMENT, AND WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT IT WILL BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE, HOWEVER, THAT

THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF FUTURE BORROWINGS, IF ANY, UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, IN THE DEBT MARKETS OR OUR CREDIT FACILITIES WILL NOT BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED BY CAPITAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

ON NOVEMBER 9, 2009, WE MADE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE FORM OF 29,211,295 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK. THE CONTRIBUTED SHARES HAD AN AGGREGATE VALUE OF $1.5

BILLION, AS OF THE CONTRIBUTION

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DATE. THE SHARE CONTRIBUTION DID NOT AFFECT CASH BALANCES. IN ADDITION, WE MADE CASH CONTRIBUTIONS OF $82 MILLION DURING 2009. IN 2010, WE WILL BEGIN MATCHING EMPLOYEE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE

COMPANY-SPONSORED 401(K) PLAN WITH COMMON STOCK INSTEAD OF CASH FOR NONUNION EMPLOYEES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008 OUR PENSION PLANS WERE

$6,356 MILLION AND $8,420 MILLION UNDERFUNDED AS MEASURED UNDER GAAP. IN 2010, REQUIRED CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLANS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO EXCEED $100 MILLION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS FOR OUR DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES. THE MOST RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS INCLUDE A LIMITATION ON MORTGAGE DEBT AND SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS AS

A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET TANGIBLE ASSETS (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS), AND A LIMITATION ON CONSOLIDATED DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL CAPITAL (AS DEFINED). WHEN CONSIDERING DEBT COVENANTS, WE CONTINUE TO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING

CAPACITY.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

PENSION CASH REQUIREMENTS ARE BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR

MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, PURSUANT TO ERISA REGULATIONS, ALTHOUGH WE MAY MAKE ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS. ESTIMATES OF OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ARE BASED ON BOTH OUR ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND THE ESTIMATED

CONTRIBUTIONS TO PLANS THAT ARE FUNDED THROUGH TRUSTS.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE

GOODS OR SERVICES THAT ARE LEGALLY BINDING; SPECIFY A FIXED, MINIMUM OR RANGE OF QUANTITIES; SPECIFY A FIXED, MINIMUM, VARIABLE, OR INDEXED PRICE PROVISION; AND SPECIFY APPROXIMATE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION. IN ADDITION, THE AGREEMENTS ARE NOT

CANCELABLE WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL PENALTY. PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE AMOUNTS RECORDED AS WELL AS AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. APPROXIMATELY 9% OF THE PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS DISCLOSED ABOVE ARE

REIMBURSABLE TO US PURSUANT TO COST-TYPE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS PRODUCTION RELATED OBLIGATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATION RELATES TO INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN

SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS THAT SPECIFY DETERMINABLE PRICES AND QUANTITIES, AND LONG-TERM DELIVERY TIMEFRAMES. IN ADDITION, WE PURCHASE RAW MATERIALS ON BEHALF OF OUR SUPPLIERS. THESE AGREEMENTS REQUIRE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO BE

PREPARED TO BUILD AND DELIVER ITEMS IN SUFFICIENT TIME TO MEET OUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULES. THE NEED FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS ARISES FROM THE EXTENDED PRODUCTION PLANNING HORIZON FOR MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION

OF THESE INVENTORY COMMITMENTS IS SUPPORTED BY FIRM CONTRACTS AND/OR HAS HISTORICALLY RESULTED IN SETTLEMENT THROUGH REIMBURSEMENT FROM CUSTOMERS FOR PENALTY PAYMENTS TO THE SUPPLIER SHOULD THE CUSTOMER NOT TAKE DELIVERY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE ALSO

INCLUDED IN OUR FORECASTS OF COSTS FOR PROGRAM AND CONTRACT ACCOUNTING. SOME INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS MAY INCLUDE ESCALATION ADJUSTMENTS. IN THESE LIMITED CASES, WE HAVE INCLUDED OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECT OF THE ESCALATION ADJUSTMENT IN

THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS

RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION PRIMARILY INCLUDE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND CERTAIN OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDING ACCRUED COMPENSATION AND DIVIDENDS PAYABLE.

INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. TO FACILITATE ECONOMIC FLOW BACK AND/OR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO

THEIR BUSINESSES OR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AS THE RESULT OF THEIR PROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND/OR SERVICES FROM US. THESE COMMITMENTS MAY BE SATISFIED BY OUR PLACEMENT OF DIRECT WORK OR VENDOR ORDERS FOR SUPPLIES, OPPORTUNITIES TO BID ON SUPPLY CONTRACTS,

TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER FORMS OF ASSISTANCE. HOWEVER, IN CERTAIN CASES, OUR COMMITMENTS MAY BE SATISFIED THROUGH OTHER PARTIES (SUCH AS OUR VENDORS) WHO PURCHASE SUPPLIES FROM OUR NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS. WE DO NOT COMMIT TO INDUSTRIAL

PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS UNLESS A CONTRACT FOR SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IS SIGNED. IN CERTAIN CASES, PENALTIES COULD BE IMPOSED IF WE DO NOT MEET OUR INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS. DURING 2009, WE INCURRED NO SUCH PENALTIES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE HAVE OUTSTANDING INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS TOTALING $11 BILLION THAT EXTEND THROUGH 2024. PURCHASE ORDER COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. TO BE

ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH A PURCHASE ORDER COMMITMENT FROM US, A FOREIGN SUPPLIER MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPABILITY TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS AND MUST BE COMPETITIVE IN COST, QUALITY AND SCHEDULE.

INCOME TAX OBLIGATIONS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, INCLUDING UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, WAS $1,009 MILLION, OF WHICH $182 MILLION WE EXPECT TO PAY IN THE NEXT

TWELVE MONTHS. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE REMAINING $827 MILLION. OUR INCOME TAX OBLIGATIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE ABOVE. SEE NOTE 5.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE ARE A PARTY TO CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDING CERTAIN GUARANTEES. FOR DISCUSSION OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, SEE NOTE 12.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING INVOLVES A JUDGMENTAL PROCESS OF ESTIMATING THE TOTAL SALES AND COSTS FOR EACH CONTRACT, WHICH RESULTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ESTIMATED COST OF

SALES PERCENTAGES. FOR EACH CONTRACT, THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED.

DUE TO THE SIZE, LENGTH OF TIME AND NATURE OF MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS, THE ESTIMATION OF TOTAL SALES AND COSTS THROUGH COMPLETION IS COMPLICATED AND SUBJECT TO MANY VARIABLES. TOTAL CONTRACT SALES ESTIMATES ARE BASED

ON NEGOTIATED CONTRACT PRICES AND QUANTITIES, MODIFIED BY OUR ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CONTRACT OPTIONS, CHANGE ORDERS, INCENTIVE AND AWARD PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE, AND PRICE ADJUSTMENT CLAUSES (SUCH AS INFLATION OR INDEX-BASED

CLAUSES). THE MAJORITY OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. GENERALLY THE PRICE IS BASED ON ESTIMATED COST TO PRODUCE THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE PLUS PROFIT. FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE TYPES OF COST THAT WILL BE

REIMBURSED IN ESTABLISHING CONTRACT PRICE. TOTAL CONTRACT COST ESTIMATES ARE LARGELY BASED ON NEGOTIATED OR ESTIMATED PURCHASE CONTRACT TERMS, HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS BASE AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE

ESTIMATES INCLUDE INFLATIONARY TRENDS, TECHNICAL AND SCHEDULE RISK, INTERNAL AND SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS VOLUME ASSUMPTIONS, ASSET UTILIZATION, AND ANTICIPATED LABOR AGREEMENTS.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES INVOLVES PROCEDURES AND PERSONNEL IN ALL AREAS THAT PROVIDE FINANCIAL OR PRODUCTION INFORMATION ON THE STATUS OF

CONTRACTS. ESTIMATES OF EACH SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS SALES AND COSTS ARE REVIEWED AND REASSESSED QUARTERLY. ANY CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES RESULT IN RECOGNITION OF CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CONTRACT PROFIT IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH CHANGES ARE

MADE.

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JUDGMENT IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS LIKELY THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

COST OF SALES AMOUNTS COULD BE RECORDED IF WE USED DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR IF THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS/ESTIMATES, SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE, OR CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ADVERSELY OR POSITIVELY AFFECT

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN FUTURE PERIODS. IF THE COMBINED GROSS MARGIN FOR ALL CONTRACTS IN BDS FOR ALL OF 2009 HAD BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE HIGHER OR LOWER BY 1%, IT WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE YEAR BY APPROXIMATELY $337

MILLION. A NUMBER OF OUR CONTRACTS ARE IN A REACHFORWARD LOSS POSITION. CHANGES TO ESTIMATED LOSS IN FUTURE PERIODS ARE RECORDED IMMEDIATELY IN EARNINGS.

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES THE DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE RELATIONSHIP OF SALES TO COSTS FOR THE

DEFINED PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. THE

DETERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY IS LIMITED BY THE ABILITY TO MAKE REASONABLY DEPENDABLE ESTIMATES OF THE REVENUE AND COST OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. FOR EACH PROGRAM, THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY

APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE FOR THE TOTAL REMAINING PROGRAM TO THE AMOUNT OF SALES RECOGNIZED FOR AIRPLANES DELIVERED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER.

FACTORS THAT MUST BE ESTIMATED INCLUDE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, SALES PRICE, LABOR AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS, MATERIAL COSTS, PROCURED PART COSTS, MAJOR COMPONENT COSTS, OVERHEAD COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS,

AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS. ESTIMATION OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH PROGRAM TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SEVERAL FACTORS THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF THE DEMAND FOR THE PARTICULAR PROGRAM, SUCH AS FIRM ORDERS, LETTERS OF INTENT FROM PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS,

AND MARKET STUDIES. TOTAL ESTIMATED PROGRAM SALES ARE DETERMINED BY ESTIMATING THE MODEL MIX AND SALES PRICE FOR ALL UNSOLD UNITS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, ADDED TOGETHER WITH THE SALES PRICES FOR ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS UNDER CONTRACT. THE

SALES PRICES FOR ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY INCLUDE AN ESCALATION ADJUSTMENT THAT IS BASED ON PROJECTED ESCALATION RATES, CONSISTENT WITH TYPICAL SALES CONTRACT TERMS. COST ESTIMATES ARE BASED LARGELY ON NEGOTIATED AND

ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS WITH SUPPLIERS, HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS, AND BUSINESS BASE AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE PRODUCTION RATES, INTERNAL AND SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, CUSTOMER AND/OR

SUPPLIER CLAIMS OR ASSERTIONS, ASSET UTILIZATION, ANTICIPATED LABOR AGREEMENTS, AND INFLATIONARY TRENDS.

TO ENSURE RELIABILITY IN OUR ESTIMATES, WE

EMPLOY A RIGOROUS ESTIMATING PROCESS THAT IS REVIEWED AND UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE NORMALLY RECOGNIZED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS; WHEN ESTIMATED COSTS TO COMPLETE A PROGRAM EXCEED ESTIMATED REVENUES FROM UNDELIVERED UNITS

IN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, A LOSS PROVISION IS RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD FOR THE ESTIMATED LOSS ON ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS IN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY.

THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING ALLOCATES TOOLING AND PRODUCTION COSTS OVER THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH PROGRAM. BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW PROGRAM AND SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT

REQUIRED FOR INITIAL TOOLING, NEW COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE 787 PROGRAM, TYPICALLY HAVE LOWER MARGINS THAN ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS.

DUE TO

THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JUDGMENT IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS LIKELY THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT COST OF SALES AMOUNTS COULD BE RECORDED IF WE USED DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS, OR IF THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN

UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS/ESTIMATES, SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE, OR CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ADVERSELY OR POSITIVELY AFFECT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN FUTURE PERIODS. IF COMBINED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAMS, EXCLUDING THE 747 PROGRAM,

FOR ALL OF 2009 HAD BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE HIGHER OR LOWER BY 1%, IT WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE YEAR BY APPROXIMATELY $275 MILLION. THE 747 PROGRAM IS IN A REACH-FORWARD LOSS POSITION. ABSENT CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED

REVENUES OR COSTS, SUBSEQUENT DELIVERIES ARE

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RECORDED AT ZERO MARGIN. REDUCTIONS TO THE ESTIMATED LOSS IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS ARE SPREAD OVER ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS IN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, WHEREAS INCREASES TO THE ESTIMATED LOSS ARE

RECORDED IMMEDIATELY.

AIRCRAFT VALUATION

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES (VALUATION PROVISION) IS USED TO PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES IN THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE BALANCE REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE BUT UNCONFIRMED LOSSES IN THE CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO. THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON VARIOUS QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL LOSS

EXPERIENCE, COLLATERAL VALUES, AND RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL CREDIT AND COLLECTIBILITY REVIEWS. THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE IS ASSESSED QUARTERLY.

THREE

PRIMARY FACTORS INFLUENCING THE LEVEL OF OUR ALLOWANCE ARE CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS, COLLATERAL VALUES AND DEFAULT RATES. IF EACH CUSTOMERS CREDIT RATING WERE UPGRADED OR DOWNGRADED BY ONE MAJOR RATING CATEGORY AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE

ALLOWANCE WOULD HAVE DECREASED BY $142 MILLION OR INCREASED BY $308 MILLION. IF THE COLLATERAL VALUES WERE 10% HIGHER OR LOWER AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE ALLOWANCE WOULD HAVE DECREASED BY $56 MILLION OR INCREASED BY $54 MILLION. IF THE

CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATES USED FOR EACH RATING CATEGORY SHOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE 1%, THE ALLOWANCE WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY $6 MILLION OR DECREASED BY $6 MILLION.

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND HELD FOR RE-LEASE

WE EVALUATE FOR IMPAIRMENT ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR ASSETS HELD FOR RE-LEASE WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THAT THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW FROM THE ASSET MAY BE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. WE USE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS WHEN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW INCLUDING THE EXPECTED FUTURE LEASE RATES, LEASE TERMS, RESIDUAL VALUE OF

THE ASSET, PERIODS IN WHICH THE ASSET MAY BE HELD IN PREPARATION FOR A FOLLOW-ON LEASE, MAINTENANCE COSTS, REMARKETING COSTS AND THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSET.

WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE RECORDED IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

HAD FUTURE LEASE RATES ON ASSETS EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT BEEN 10% LOWER, WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WOULD HAVE INCURRED ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE OF $8 MILLION FOR THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009.

LEASE RESIDUAL VALUES

EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND ASSETS HELD FOR RE-LEASE ARE CARRIED AT COST LESS

ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND ARE DEPRECIATED TO ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD THAT WE PROJECT WE WILL HOLD THE ASSET FOR LEASE. ESTIMATES USED IN DETERMINING RESIDUAL VALUES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT

AND TIMING OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE FOR EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND ASSETS HELD FOR RE-LEASE. IF THE ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES DECLINED 10% AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THIS WOULD RESULT IN A FUTURE CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX EARNINGS IMPACT OF

APPROXIMATELY $180 MILLION RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING DEPRECIABLE PERIODS, OF WHICH APPROXIMATELY $45 MILLION WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN 2010.

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENTS

GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT

AMORTIZED BUT ARE ANNUALLY TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT, AND WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SUCH THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. APRIL 1 IS OUR ANNUAL TESTING DATE. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY FIRST

COMPARING THE BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN BOOK VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. IN THIS PROCESS, A FAIR VALUE FOR GOODWILL IS ESTIMATED, BASED IN PART ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPERATIONS, AND IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE SHORTFALL OF THE

FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.

WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS USING DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOWS. FORECASTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE SALES AND OPERATING COSTS, BASED PRIMARILY ON EXISTING FIRM ORDERS, EXPECTED FUTURE ORDERS, CONTRACTS WITH SUPPLIERS, LABOR AGREEMENTS, AND GENERAL MARKET

CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN THESE FORECASTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT RECORDED, IF ANY.

THE CASH FLOW FORECASTS ARE ADJUSTED BY AN

APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE DERIVED FROM OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION PLUS A SUITABLE CONTROL PREMIUM AT THE DATE OF EVALUATION. THEREFORE, CHANGES IN THE STOCK PRICE MAY ALSO AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT RECORDED, IF ANY.

CHANGES IN OUR FORECASTS OR DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD CAUSE BOOK VALUES OF CERTAIN OPERATIONS TO EXCEED THEIR FAIR VALUES WHICH MAY RESULT IN

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FUTURE PERIODS. A 10% DECREASE IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ANY OF OUR OPERATIONS WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, WE HAD $499 MILLION OF INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO THE JEPPESEN AND AVIALL BRAND AND TRADE NAMES ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WE TEST THESE INTANGIBLES

FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUE TO CURRENT PROJECTIONS OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BRAND AND TRADE NAMES. ANY EXCESS CARRYING VALUE OVER THE AMOUNT OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. A

10% DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

POSTRETIREMENT

PLANS

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OUR EMPLOYEES ARE COVERED BY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS. WE ALSO HAVE OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS CONSISTING

PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTHCARE COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS. ACCOUNTING RULES REQUIRE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF OUR PROJECTED OBLIGATIONS AND PLAN ASSETS. THESE MEASUREMENTS REQUIRE SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS. SIGNIFICANT ASSUMPTIONS

INCLUDE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN, AND MEDICAL TREND RATE (RATE OF GROWTH FOR MEDICAL COSTS). FUTURE CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS OR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FUTURE

ANNUAL EXPENSE, PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY.

IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, WE SHOW THE SENSITIVITY OF OUR PENSION AND OTHER

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PENSION EXPENSE IS ALSO SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN. A DECREASE OR INCREASE OF

25 BASIS POINTS IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED 2009 NET PERIODIC PENSION EXPENSE BY $117 MILLION.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS CAN AFFECT FUTURE YEARS PENSION COST. THE ASSET BALANCE USED TO CALCULATE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS IS A CALCULATED VALUE THAT RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF

ASSETS OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD. DESPITE INVESTMENT GAINS DURING 2009, THE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES INCURRED DURING 2008 WILL CAUSE NET PERIODIC PENSION COST FOR 2010 TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $100 MILLION DUE TO AMORTIZATION OF ACTUARIAL LOSSES. ABSENT

A RECOVERY OF ASSET VALUES OR HIGHER INTEREST RATES OR HIGHER CONTRIBUTIONS, NET PERIODIC PENSION EXPENSE WILL INCREASE FURTHER IN FUTURE YEARS.

THE

ASSUMED MEDICAL TREND RATES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE FOLLOWING YEARS EXPENSE, RECORDED LIABILITIES AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, WE SHOW THE SENSITIVITY OF OUR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN LIABILITIES AND

NET PERIODIC COST TO A 100 BASIS POINT CHANGE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE RISK

WE HAVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE

SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK, PRINCIPALLY FIXED-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, AND CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, BCC USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES. EXPOSURE TO

THIS RISK IS MANAGED BY GENERALLY MATCHING THE PROFILE OF BCCS LIABILITIES WITH THAT OF BCCS ASSETS IN RELATION TO AMOUNT AND TERMS SUCH AS EXPECTED MATURITIES AND FIXED VERSUS FLOATING INTEREST RATES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE

IMPACT TO BCCS PRE-TAX EARNINGS OF A 100 BASIS POINT IMMEDIATE AND SUSTAINED RISE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD BE INSIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED MATERIAL GAINS OR LOSSES ON OUR INVESTMENTS

OR CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DUE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

BASED ON THE PORTFOLIO OF OTHER BOEING FIXED-RATE DEBT, THE UNHEDGED

EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IS NOT MATERIAL. THE INVESTORS IN THE FIXED-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT WE ISSUE DO NOT GENERALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEMAND WE PAY OFF THESE OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO MATURITY. THEREFORE, EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IS NOT

BELIEVED TO BE MATERIAL FOR OUR FIXED-RATE DEBT.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK RELATING TO RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY

FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FIRMLY COMMITTED AND FORECASTED FOREIGN DENOMINATED PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS RELATED TO OUR ONGOING BUSINESS. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, A 10% INCREASE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS WOULD HAVE DECREASED OUR UNREALIZED GAINS BY $136 MILLION AND A 10% DECREASE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE WOULD

HAVE INCREASED OUR UNREALIZED GAINS BY $150 MILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2008, A 10% INCREASE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS WOULD HAVE DECREASED OUR UNREALIZED LOSSES BY $70 MILLION AND A 10%

DECREASE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE WOULD HAVE DECREASED OUR UNREALIZED LOSSES BY $196 MILLION. CONSISTENT WITH THE USE OF THESE CONTRACTS TO NEUTRALIZE THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, SUCH UNREALIZED LOSSES OR GAINS WOULD BE OFFSET BY

CORRESPONDING GAINS OR LOSSES, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE REMEASUREMENT OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED. WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE FORWARD CURRENCY CONTRACTS AND THE OFFSETTING UNDERLYING COMMITMENTS DO NOT CREATE MATERIAL MARKET RISK.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008, 2007

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS

REPORT HAVE BEEN PREPARED BY MANAGEMENT OF THE BOEING COMPANY (HEREIN REFERRED TO AS BOEING, THE COMPANY, WE, US, OR OUR). THESE STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF ALL MAJORITY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARIES AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE CONSOLIDATED. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. CERTAIN AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED A NEWLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARD WHICH WAS RETROSPECTIVELY APPLIED AND REQUIRES THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST TO BE SEPARATELY PRESENTED AS A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE IMPACT OF THIS STANDARD WAS NOT MATERIAL TO THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

USE OF ESTIMATES

MANAGEMENT MAKES ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES TO PREPARE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THOSE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES DIRECTLY AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES FOR WHICH CHANGES IN THE NEAR TERM ARE CONSIDERED REASONABLY

POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DISCLOSED IN THESE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OPERATING CYCLE

FOR CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WE USE THE DURATION OF THE RELATED CONTRACT OR PROGRAM AS

OUR OPERATING CYCLE, WHICH IS GENERALLY LONGER THAN ONE YEAR AND COULD EXCEED 3 YEARS.

REVENUE AND RELATED COST RECOGNITION

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING IS USED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES PREDOMINANTLY BY BOEING DEFENSE, SPACE & SECURITY (BDS)

(FORMERLY IDS). THE MAJORITY OF BUSINESS CONDUCTED BY BDS IS PERFORMED UNDER CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT EXTEND OVER SEVERAL YEARS. CONTRACT ACCOUNTING INVOLVES A JUDGMENTAL PROCESS OF ESTIMATING THE TOTAL SALES AND

COSTS FOR EACH CONTRACT RESULTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES. FOR EACH CONTRACT, THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE

RECOGNIZED.

WE COMBINE CONTRACTS FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES WHEN THEY ARE NEGOTIATED AS A PACKAGE WITH AN OVERALL PROFIT MARGIN OBJECTIVE, ESSENTIALLY

REPRESENT AN AGREEMENT TO DO A SINGLE PROJECT FOR A SINGLE CUSTOMER, INVOLVE INTERRELATED CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL COMMON COSTS, AND ARE PERFORMED CONCURRENTLY OR SEQUENTIALLY. WHEN A GROUP OF CONTRACTS IS COMBINED, REVENUE AND

PROFIT ARE EARNED UNIFORMLY OVER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBINED CONTRACTS.

SALES RELATED TO FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS DELIVERIES ARE

MADE, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD BEFORE DELIVERIES BEGIN, FOR WHICH SALES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE MILESTONES. SALES RELATED TO CONTRACTS IN WHICH

WE ARE REIMBURSED FOR COSTS INCURRED PLUS AN AGREED UPON PROFIT ARE RECORDED AS

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COSTS ARE INCURRED. THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE TYPES OF COST THAT WILL BE REIMBURSED IN ESTABLISHING CONTRACT PRICE. CONTRACTS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS TO EARN

INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES IF SPECIFIED TARGETS ARE ACHIEVED. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND ARE PROBABLE ARE RECORDED OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD OF THE CONTRACT. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT CANNOT BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED ARE RECORDED WHEN AWARDED.

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT PREDOMINANTLY USES PROGRAM ACCOUNTING TO ACCOUNT FOR

COST OF SALES RELATED TO ITS PROGRAMS. PROGRAM ACCOUNTING IS APPLICABLE TO PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED FOR DELIVERY UNDER PRODUCTION-TYPE CONTRACTS WHERE PROFITABILITY IS REALIZED OVER MULTIPLE CONTRACTS AND YEARS. UNDER PROGRAM ACCOUNTING, INVENTORIABLE

PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS, AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED AND CHARGED TO COST OF SALES BY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF BY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR CONTRACTS. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A

PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY IS LIMITED BY THE ABILITY TO MAKE REASONABLY DEPENDABLE ESTIMATES OF THE REVENUE

AND COST OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP OF SALES TO COST OF SALES, PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF (A) THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN A PROGRAM, (B) THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE

UNITS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED, AND (C) THE UNITS EXPECTED SALES PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING, AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM.

WE RECOGNIZE SALES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DELIVERIES AS EACH UNIT IS COMPLETED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. SALES RECOGNIZED REPRESENT THE PRICE NEGOTIATED WITH THE CUSTOMER, ADJUSTED BY AN ESCALATION FORMULA AS

SPECIFIED IN THE CUSTOMER AGREEMENT. THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE FOR THE TOTAL REMAINING PROGRAM TO THE AMOUNT OF SALES RECOGNIZED FOR AIRPLANES DELIVERED AND ACCEPTED BY THE

CUSTOMER.

CONCESSION SHARING ARRANGEMENTS

WE ACCOUNT FOR SALES CONCESSIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN CONSIDERATION OF THEIR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DELIVERED. THE SALES CONCESSIONS INCURRED MAY BE PARTIALLY REIMBURSED BY CERTAIN SUPPLIERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONCESSION SHARING ARRANGEMENTS. WE RECORD THESE

REIMBURSEMENTS, WHICH ARE PRESUMED TO REPRESENT REDUCTIONS IN THE PRICE OF THE VENDORS PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AS A REDUCTION IN COST OF PRODUCTS.

SPARE PARTS REVENUE

WE RECOGNIZE SALES OF SPARE PARTS UPON DELIVERY AND THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS RECORDED AT AVERAGE COST.

SERVICE REVENUE

SERVICE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT SERVICE AGREEMENTS, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING CONTRACT ACCOUNTING. SERVICE ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE: SUPPORT

AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND HELICOPTER CONTRACTS, ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND SPACE SHUTTLE, COMMERCIAL DELTA LAUNCHES AND TECHNICAL AND FLIGHT OPERATION SERVICES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. SERVICE

REVENUE AND ASSOCIATED COST OF SALES FROM PAY-IN-ADVANCE SUBSCRIPTION FEES ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED.

FINANCIAL SERVICES

REVENUE

WE RECORD FINANCIAL SERVICES REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH SALES-TYPE FINANCE LEASES, OPERATING LEASES, AND NOTES RECEIVABLE.

LEASE AND FINANCING

REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN SALES OF SERVICES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR SALES-TYPE FINANCE LEASES, WE RECORD AN ASSET AT LEASE INCEPTION. THIS ASSET IS RECORDED AT THE AGGREGATE FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS,

ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OF THE LEASED EQUIPMENT, AND DEFERRED INCREMENTAL DIRECT COSTS LESS UNEARNED INCOME. INCOME IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE LEASE TO APPROXIMATE A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN ON THE NET INVESTMENT. RESIDUAL VALUES,

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHICH ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY, REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE AT LEASE TERMINATION FROM THE DISPOSITION OF THE LEASED EQUIPMENT. ACTUAL RESIDUAL VALUES REALIZED COULD

DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. DECLINES IN ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE THAT ARE DEEMED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY ARE RECOGNIZED AS COST OF SERVICES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DECLINES OCCUR.

FOR OPERATING LEASES, REVENUE ON LEASED AIRCRAFT AND EQUIPMENT IS RECORDED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE. OPERATING LEASE ASSETS, INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER FINANCING, ARE RECORDED AT COST AND

DEPRECIATED OVER THE PERIOD THAT WE PROJECT WE WILL HOLD THE ASSET TO AN ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE, USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. PREPAYMENTS RECEIVED ON OPERATING LEASE CONTRACTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR ESTIMATES OF RESIDUAL VALUE AND RECOGNIZE FORECASTED CHANGES BY PROSPECTIVELY ADJUSTING DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.

FOR NOTES RECEIVABLE, NOTES ARE RECORDED NET OF ANY UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNTS AND DEFERRED INCREMENTAL DIRECT COSTS. INTEREST INCOME AND AMORTIZATION OF ANY DISCOUNTS ARE RECORDED RATABLY OVER THE RELATED TERM OF THE

NOTE.

REINSURANCE REVENUE

OUR WHOLLY-OWNED INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY, ASTRO LTD., PARTICIPATES IN A REINSURANCE POOL FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION.

THE MEMBER AGREEMENTS AND PRACTICES OF THE REINSURANCE POOL MINIMIZE ANY PARTICIPATING MEMBERS INDIVIDUAL RISK. REINSURANCE REVENUES WERE $122, $83 AND $84 DURING 2009, 2008, AND 2007 RESPECTIVELY. REINSURANCE COSTS RELATED TO PREMIUMS AND

CLAIMS PAID TO THE REINSURANCE POOL WERE $118, $86, AND $93 DURING 2009, 2008, AND 2007 RESPECTIVELY. REVENUES AND COSTS ARE PRESENTED NET IN COST OF SERVICES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

FLEET SUPPORT

WE PROVIDE ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES TO FACILITATE

EFFICIENT AND SAFE AIRCRAFT OPERATION TO THE OPERATORS OF ALL OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE MODELS. COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS FLEET SUPPORT SERVICES, THESE ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES INCLUDE FLIGHT AND MAINTENANCE TRAINING, FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT, ENGINEERING

SERVICES, AND TECHNICAL DATA AND DOCUMENTS. FLEET SUPPORT ACTIVITY BEGINS PRIOR TO AIRCRAFT DELIVERY AS THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES TRAINING, MANUALS, AND TECHNICAL CONSULTING SUPPORT. THIS ACTIVITY CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE AIRCRAFTS OPERATIONAL

LIFE. SERVICES PROVIDED AFTER DELIVERY INCLUDE FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT, CONSULTING ON MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES BROUGHT FORTH BY THE CUSTOMER OR REGULATORS, UPDATING MANUALS AND ENGINEERING DATA, AND THE ISSUANCE OF SERVICE BULLETINS

THAT IMPACT THE ENTIRE MODELS FLEET. FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT INVOLVES OUR PERSONNEL LOCATED AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES PROVIDING AND COORDINATING FLEET SUPPORT ACTIVITIES AND REQUESTS. THE COSTS FOR FLEET SUPPORT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AS COST OF

SERVICES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT INCLUDES COSTS INCURRED FOR EXPERIMENTATION, DESIGN, TESTING, AND BID AND PROPOSAL EFFORTS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED UNLESS THE COSTS ARE RELATED TO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS. COSTS

THAT ARE INCURRED PURSUANT TO SUCH CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE RECORDED OVER THE PERIOD THAT REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED, CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONTRACT ACCOUNTING POLICY. WE HAVE CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT MEET THE REQUIREMENT FOR

BEST EFFORTS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTING. ACCORDINGLY, THE AMOUNTS FUNDED BY THE CUSTOMER ARE RECOGNIZED AS AN OFFSET TO OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE RATHER THAN AS CONTRACT REVENUES.

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOME SUPPLIERS FOR THE 787 PROGRAM, WHICH HAVE ENHANCED OUR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES AND HAVE OFFSET A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RISK OF DEVELOPING THIS AIRCRAFT. OUR COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS STATE THAT THE SUPPLIER CONTRIBUTIONS ARE FOR REIMBURSEMENTS OF COSTS WE INCUR FOR EXPERIMENTATION, BASIC DESIGN, AND TESTING

ACTIVITIES DURING THE 787 DEVELOPMENT. IN EACH ARRANGEMENT, WE RETAIN SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS TO THE 787 PART OR COMPONENT COVERED BY THE ARRANGEMENT. THE AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM THESE COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES SINCE WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO REFUND ANY AMOUNTS RECEIVED PER THE ARRANGEMENTS REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. SPECIFICALLY, UNDER THE TERMS OF EACH AGREEMENT, PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS FOR THEIR

SHARE OF THE COSTS ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON MILESTONES AND ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED WHEN WE ACHIEVE THE MILESTONE EVENTS AND NO ONGOING OBLIGATION ON OUR PART EXISTS. IN THE EVENT WE RECEIVE A MILESTONE PAYMENT PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE

MILESTONE, THE AMOUNT IS CLASSIFIED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES UNTIL EARNED.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

WE PROVIDE VARIOUS FORMS OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION TO OUR EMPLOYEES. FOR AWARDS SETTLED IN SHARES, WE MEASURE COMPENSATION EXPENSE BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE

NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES. FOR AWARDS SETTLED IN CASH, OR THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN CASH, WE MEASURE COMPENSATION EXPENSE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE AT EACH REPORTING DATE NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES. THE EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE REQUISITE

SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE AWARD.

INCOME TAXES

PROVISIONS FOR FEDERAL, STATE, AND NON-U.S. INCOME TAXES ARE CALCULATED ON REPORTED EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES BASED ON CURRENT TAX LAW AND ALSO INCLUDE, IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ANY

CHANGES IN TAX RATES FROM THOSE USED PREVIOUSLY IN DETERMINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. SUCH PROVISIONS DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNTS CURRENTLY RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE BECAUSE CERTAIN ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE RECOGNIZED IN DIFFERENT TIME

PERIODS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES THAN FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND EVALUATING TAX POSITIONS.

THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES REQUIRES A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THRESHOLD FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. WE RECORD

A LIABILITY FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BENEFIT RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES AND THE TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN ON OUR TAX RETURN. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR ASSESSMENT OF SUCH TAX POSITIONS CHANGES, THE

CHANGE IN ESTIMATE IS RECORDED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DETERMINATION IS MADE. TAX-RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

WE SPONSOR VARIOUS PENSION PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES. WE ALSO PROVIDE

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS. BENEFITS UNDER THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AGE AT

RETIREMENT AND YEARS OF SERVICE AND, FOR SOME PENSION PLANS, BENEFITS ARE ALSO BASED ON THE EMPLOYEES ANNUAL EARNINGS. THE NET PERIODIC COST OF OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IS DETERMINED USING THE PROJECTED UNIT CREDIT METHOD AND

SEVERAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN, AND MEDICAL TREND (RATE OF GROWTH FOR MEDICAL COSTS). A PORTION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT INCOME OR

EXPENSE IS NOT RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS IN THE YEAR INCURRED BECAUSE IT IS ALLOCATED TO PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT COSTS, AND REFLECTED IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD. IF GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH OCCUR WHEN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE DIFFERS FROM

ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, EXCEED TEN PERCENT OF THE GREATER OF PLAN ASSETS OR PLAN LIABILITIES WE AMORTIZE THEM OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SERVICE PERIOD OF EMPLOYEES. THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IS REFLECTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2008,

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS REQUIRED US TO MEASURE OUR PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, THE DATE OF OUR YEAR END. WE PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED THIS MEASUREMENT AT SEPTEMBER 30 OF EACH YEAR.

POSTEMPLOYMENT PLANS

WE RECORD A LIABILITY FOR POSTEMPLOYMENT

BENEFITS, SUCH AS SEVERANCE OR JOB TRAINING, WHEN PAYMENT IS PROBABLE, THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, AND THE OBLIGATION RELATES TO RIGHTS THAT HAVE VESTED OR ACCUMULATED.

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT,

INCLUDING THOSE FOR DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES. WE ROUTINELY ASSESS, BASED ON IN-DEPTH STUDIES, EXPERT ANALYSES AND LEGAL REVIEWS, OUR CONTINGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS, AND COMMITMENTS FOR REMEDIATION OF

CONTAMINATED SITES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RANGES AND PROBABILITIES OF RECOVERIES FROM OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO HAVE AND HAVE NOT AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT AND OF RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS. OUR POLICY IS TO ACCRUE AND CHARGE TO CURRENT

EXPENSE IDENTIFIED EXPOSURES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SITES BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE WITHIN A RANGE OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURE FOR INVESTIGATION, CLEANUP, AND MONITORING COSTS TO BE INCURRED. ESTIMATED REMEDIATION COSTS ARE NOT DISCOUNTED

TO PRESENT VALUE AS THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. WE MAY BE ABLE TO RECOVER A PORTION OF THE REMEDIATION COSTS FROM INSURERS OR OTHER THIRD-PARTIES. SUCH RECOVERIES ARE RECORDED WHEN REALIZATION OF THE CLAIM FOR RECOVERY IS

DEEMED PROBABLE.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH

AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF HIGHLY LIQUID INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, TIME DEPOSITS, AND OTHER MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS, WHICH HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS. WE AGGREGATE OUR CASH BALANCES

BY BANK, AND RECLASSIFY ANY NEGATIVE BALANCES TO ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE INCLUDED $211 AND $157 AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHECKS WRITTEN BUT NOT YET CLEARED BY THE BANK.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIED COSTS ON COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS

AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTS INCLUDE DIRECT ENGINEERING, PRODUCTION AND TOOLING COSTS, AND APPLICABLE OVERHEAD, WHICH INCLUDES FRINGE BENEFITS, PRODUCTION RELATED INDIRECT AND PLANT MANAGEMENT SALARIES AND PLANT SERVICES, NOT IN EXCESS OF ESTIMATED NET

REALIZABLE VALUE. TO THE EXTENT A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF SUCH COSTS ARE RELATED TO AN ABNORMAL EVENT OR ARE FIXED COSTS NOT APPROPRIATELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR PROGRAMS OR CONTRACTS, THEY ARE EXPENSED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD RATHER THAN INVENTORIED.

INVENTORIED COSTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS RELATING TO PROGRAMS AND CONTRACTS WITH LONG-TERM PRODUCTION CYCLES, A PORTION OF WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED WITHIN ONE YEAR. INCLUDED IN INVENTORY FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS IS AN ALLOCATION OF

ALLOWABLE COSTS RELATED TO MANUFACTURING PROCESS REENGINEERING.

BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW OR

DERIVATIVE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAM, THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED FOR PRODUCTION OF THE EARLY UNITS IN THE PROGRAM MAY EXCEED THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES FOR THOSE UNITS. IN ADDITION, THE USE OF A TOTAL PROGRAM GROSS PROFIT RATE TO

DELIVERED UNITS MAY RESULT IN COSTS ASSIGNED TO DELIVERED UNITS IN A REPORTING PERIOD BEING LESS THAN THE ACTUAL COST OF THOSE UNITS. THE EXCESS ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED OVER THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DISCLOSED AS DEFERRED PRODUCTION

COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORY ALONG WITH UNAMORTIZED TOOLING COSTS.

60

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE DETERMINATION OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF LONG-TERM CONTRACT COSTS IS BASED UPON QUARTERLY REVIEWS THAT DETERMINE

AN ESTIMATE OF COSTS TO BE INCURRED TO COMPLETE ALL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS. WHEN ACTUAL CONTRACT COSTS AND THE ESTIMATE TO COMPLETE EXCEED TOTAL ESTIMATED CONTRACT REVENUES, A LOSS PROVISION IS RECORDED. THE DETERMINATION OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAM COSTS IS BASED UPON QUARTERLY PROGRAM REVIEWS THAT DETERMINE AN ESTIMATE OF REVENUE AND COST TO BE INCURRED TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. WHEN ESTIMATED COSTS TO COMPLETE EXCEED ESTIMATED PROGRAM REVENUES

TO GO, A PROGRAM LOSS PROVISION IS RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD FOR THE ESTIMATED LOSS ON ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS IN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY.

USED

AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT AND GENERAL STOCK MATERIALS ARE STATED AT COST NOT IN EXCESS OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE. SEE AIRCRAFT VALUATION WITHIN THIS NOTE FOR OUR VALUATION OF USED AIRCRAFT. SPARE PARTS

INVENTORY IS STATED AT LOWER OF AVERAGE UNIT COST OR MARKET. WE REVIEW OUR COMMERCIAL SPARE PARTS AND GENERAL STOCK MATERIALS QUARTERLY TO IDENTIFY IMPAIRED INVENTORY, INCLUDING EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY, BASED ON HISTORICAL SALES TRENDS,

EXPECTED PRODUCTION USAGE, AND THE SIZE AND AGE OF THE AIRCRAFT FLEET USING THE PART. IMPAIRED INVENTORIES ARE CHARGED TO COST OF PRODUCTS IN THE PERIOD THE IMPAIRMENT OCCURS.

INCLUDED IN INVENTORY FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS ARE AMOUNTS PAID OR CREDITED IN CASH, OR OTHER CONSIDERATION TO CERTAIN AIRLINE CUSTOMERS, THAT ARE REFERRED TO AS EARLY ISSUE SALES CONSIDERATION. EARLY ISSUE

SALES CONSIDERATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE WHEN THE DELIVERY OF THE AIRCRAFT UNDER CONTRACT OCCURS. IN THE UNLIKELY SITUATION THAT AN AIRLINE CUSTOMER WAS NOT ABLE TO PERFORM AND TAKE DELIVERY OF THE CONTRACTED AIRCRAFT, WE BELIEVE

THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS PAID THROUGH RETAINING AMOUNTS SECURED BY ADVANCES RECEIVED ON AIRCRAFT TO BE DELIVERED. HOWEVER, TO THE EXTENT EARLY ISSUE SALES CONSIDERATION EXCEEDS ADVANCES AND IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE

RECOVERABLE, IT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS A CURRENT PERIOD EXPENSE.

WE NET ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS ON LONG-TERM CONTRACTS AGAINST INVENTORY IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS IN EXCESS OF RELATED INVENTORY ARE REPORTED IN ADVANCES AND BILLINGS IN EXCESS OF RELATED COSTS.

PRECONTRACT COSTS

WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, INCUR COSTS TO BEGIN FULFILLING THE STATEMENT OF WORK UNDER A

SPECIFIC ANTICIPATED CONTRACT THAT WE ARE STILL NEGOTIATING WITH A CUSTOMER. IF WE DETERMINE IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE AWARDED THE SPECIFIC ANTICIPATED CONTRACT, THEN WE CAPITALIZE THE PRECONTRACT COSTS WE INCUR, EXCLUDING ANY START-UP COSTS

WHICH ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. CAPITALIZED PRECONTRACT COSTS OF $183 AND $350 AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORIES, NET OF ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS, IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST, INCLUDING APPLICABLE CONSTRUCTION-PERIOD INTEREST, LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND ARE DEPRECIATED PRINCIPALLY OVER THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES: NEW BUILDINGS AND LAND IMPROVEMENTS, FROM 10 TO 40 YEARS;

AND NEW MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, FROM 3 TO 20 YEARS. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF DEPRECIATION ARE AS FOLLOWS: BUILDINGS AND LAND IMPROVEMENTS, 150% DECLINING BALANCE; AND MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS. CAPITALIZED INTERNAL

USE SOFTWARE IS INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS AND AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT LINE METHOD OVER FIVE YEARS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF REMAINING DEPRECIABLE LIVES ASSIGNED TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING ASSETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO

A MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR DISPOSITION.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR SALE ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO SELL. LONG-LIVED ASSETS

HELD FOR USE ARE SUBJECT TO AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS NO LONGER RECOVERABLE BASED UPON THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF

THE IMPAIRMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

WE RECORD ALL KNOWN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH THE LIABILITYS FAIR VALUE CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, INCLUDING CERTAIN ASBESTOS REMOVAL, ASSET

DECOMMISSIONING AND CONTRACTUAL LEASE RESTORATION OBLIGATIONS. RECORDED AMOUNTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.

WE ALSO HAVE KNOWN CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS, SUCH AS CERTAIN ASBESTOS REMEDIATION AND ASSET DECOMMISSIONING ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN THE FUTURE, THAT ARE NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE TIMING AND METHOD OF SETTLEMENT OF THE OBLIGATION.

ACCORDINGLY, THESE OBLIGATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A LIABILITY FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS WILL BE RECORDED IN THE PERIOD WHEN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION REGARDING TIMING AND METHOD OF SETTLEMENT BECOMES AVAILABLE

TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LIABILITYS FAIR VALUE. IN ADDITION, THERE MAY BE CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE NOT YET DISCOVERED (E.G. ASBESTOS MAY EXIST IN CERTAIN BUILDINGS BUT WE HAVE NOT BECOME AWARE OF IT

THROUGH THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS), AND THEREFORE, THESE OBLIGATIONS ALSO HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED, BUT ARE

TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SUCH THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. OUR ANNUAL TESTING DATE IS APRIL 1.

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY FIRST COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE

LESS THAN CARRYING VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. IN THIS PROCESS, A FAIR VALUE FOR GOODWILL IS ESTIMATED, BASED IN PART ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPERATIONS, AND IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE

SHORTFALL OF THE FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES CONSIST OF BRAND AND TRADE

NAMES ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WE TEST THESE INTANGIBLES FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUE TO CURRENT PROJECTIONS OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BRAND AND TRADE NAMES. ANY EXCESS CARRYING VALUE OVER THE AMOUNT

OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT.

OUR FINITE-LIVED ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS

OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AS FOLLOWS: DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY, FROM 3 TO 14 YEARS; PRODUCT KNOW-HOW, FROM 3 TO 30 YEARS; CUSTOMER BASE, FROM 1 TO 19 YEARS; DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS, FROM 9 TO 30 YEARS; AND OTHER, FROM 1 TO 32 YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF FINITE-LIVED ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS NO LONGER RECOVERABLE BASED UPON THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE

CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

INVESTMENTS

WE CLASSIFY INVESTMENT SECURITIES AS EITHER HELD-TO-MATURITY OR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES INCLUDE TIME DEPOSITS AND ARE

CARRIED AT COST.

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES INCLUDE MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND ENHANCED EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES

AND ARE RECORDED AT THEIR FAIR VALUES, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED AS PART OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED

BASED ON THE COST OF SECURITIES USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON ALL OTHER AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT QUARTERLY. TO DETERMINE IF AN IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, WE CONSIDER THE DURATION AND SEVERITY OF

THE LOSS POSITION, THE STRENGTH OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, THE TERM TO MATURITY, CREDIT RATING AND OUR INTENT TO SELL. FOR DEBT SECURITIES THAT ARE DEEMED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AND THERE IS NO INTENT TO SELL, IMPAIRMENTS ARE SEPARATED

INTO THE AMOUNT RELATED TO THE CREDIT LOSS, WHICH IS RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, AND THE AMOUNT RELATED TO ALL OTHER FACTORS, WHICH IS RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS. FOR DEBT SECURITIES THAT ARE DEEMED

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED AND THERE IS AN INTENT TO SELL, IMPAIRMENTS IN THEIR ENTIRETY ARE RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EQUITY SECURITIES THAT ARE DEEMED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, IMPAIRMENTS IN THEIR

ENTIRETY ARE RECORDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED USING THE COST RECOVERY METHOD.

THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IS USED TO ACCOUNT FOR INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER AN INVESTEE. SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE IS GENERALLY DEEMED TO

EXIST IF WE HAVE AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE VOTING STOCK OF AN INVESTEE OF BETWEEN 20% AND 50%.

WE CLASSIFY INVESTMENT INCOME AND LOSS ON OUR

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OPERATING OR NON-OPERATING IN NATURE. OPERATING INVESTMENTS ALIGN STRATEGICALLY AND ARE INTEGRATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS. EARNINGS FROM OPERATING INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING OUR SHARE

OF INCOME OR LOSS FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, DIVIDEND INCOME FROM CERTAIN COST METHOD INVESTMENTS, AND ANY IMPAIRMENTS OR GAIN/LOSS ON THE DISPOSITION OF THESE INVESTMENTS, ARE RECORDED IN INCOME FROM OPERATING INVESTMENTS, NET. NON-OPERATING

INVESTMENTS ARE THOSE WE HOLD FOR NON-STRATEGIC PURPOSES. EARNINGS FROM NON-OPERATING INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND ANY IMPAIRMENTS OR GAIN/LOSS ON THE DISPOSITION OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED IN

OTHER (EXPENSE)/INCOME, NET.

DERIVATIVES

ALL

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE REGARDLESS OF THE PURPOSE OR INTENT OF HOLDING THEM. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO PRINCIPALLY MANAGE A VARIETY OF MARKET RISKS. FOR DERIVATIVES

DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RECOGNIZED ASSET OR LIABILITY OR A FIRM COMMITMENT (REFERRED TO AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES), THE GAIN OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE

OFFSETTING LOSS OR GAIN ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. THE EFFECT OF THAT ACCOUNTING IS TO INCLUDE IN EARNINGS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HEDGE IS NOT EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE. FOR OUR CASH FLOW

HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE DERIVATIVES GAIN OR LOSS IS INITIALLY REPORTED IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS) AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR

PERIODS DURING WHICH THE HEDGED FORECASTED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS OF A CASH FLOW HEDGE IS REPORTED IN EARNINGS IMMEDIATELY. WE ALSO HOLD CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS FOR ECONOMIC PURPOSES THAT ARE NOT

DESIGNATED FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. FOR THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, THE CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE ALSO RECORDED IN EARNINGS IMMEDIATELY.

AIRCRAFT VALUATION

USED AIRCRAFT UNDER TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS AND AIRCRAFT UNDER REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNING A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF NEW AIRCRAFT (SALE AIRCRAFT), WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SPECIFIED-PRICE TRADE-IN

COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO TRADE IN USED AIRCRAFT UPON THE PURCHASE OF SALE AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS WHEREIN WE AGREE TO REPURCHASE THE

SALE AIRCRAFT AT A SPECIFIED PRICE, GENERALLY TEN YEARS AFTER DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT. OUR REPURCHASE OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT IS CONTINGENT UPON A FUTURE, MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT. IF WE EXECUTE AN

AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT, AND IF THE CUSTOMER EXERCISES ITS RIGHT TO SELL THE SALE AIRCRAFT TO US, A CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENT WOULD BECOME A TRADE-IN COMMITMENT. OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE IS THAT NO CONTINGENT

REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS HAVE BECOME TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS.

ALL TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008 ARE SOLELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALE

AIRCRAFT AND DID NOT ORIGINATE FROM CONTINGENT REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. EXPOSURE RELATED TO TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS MAY TAKE THE FORM OF.

(1)

ADJUSTMENTS TO REVENUE FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN PRICE IN THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT AND OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT AS

OF THE DATE OF SUCH AGREEMENT, WHICH WOULD BE RECORDED IN INVENTORY AND RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT, AND/OR

(2)

CHARGES TO COST OF PRODUCTS FOR ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT THAT OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR SALE AIRCRAFT BUT PRIOR TO

THE PURCHASE OF THE USED TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT. ESTIMATES BASED ON CURRENT AIRCRAFT VALUES WOULD BE INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES.

THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT IS DETERMINED USING AIRCRAFT SPECIFIC DATA SUCH AS MODEL, AGE AND CONDITION, MARKET CONDITIONS FOR SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT AND SIMILAR MODELS, AND MULTIPLE VALUATION SOURCES. THIS PROCESS USES OUR ASSESSMENT OF

THE MARKET FOR EACH TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT, WHICH IN MOST INSTANCES BEGINS YEARS BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE AIRCRAFT. THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE MARKETS IN WHICH WE CONTINUALLY PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO PLACE USED AIRCRAFT. THESE MARKETS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO, THE RESALE MARKET, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY INCLUDE THE COST OF LONG-TERM STORAGE; THE LEASING MARKET, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR REFURBISHMENT COSTS TO MEET THE LEASING CUSTOMERS REQUIREMENTS; OR THE SCRAP MARKET. TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT

VALUATION VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON WHICH MARKET WE DETERMINE IS MOST LIKELY FOR EACH AIRCRAFT. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE UPDATE OUR VALUATION ANALYSIS BASED ON THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH PLACING EACH AIRCRAFT INTO A MARKET. THIS

QUARTERLY VALUATION PROCESS YIELDS RESULTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY LOWER THAN RESIDUAL VALUE ESTIMATES BY INDEPENDENT SOURCES AND TENDS TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT RESULTS UPON THE ACTUAL PLACEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT.

USED AIRCRAFT ACQUIRED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET AS IT IS OUR INTENT TO SELL THESE ASSETS. TO

MITIGATE COSTS AND ENHANCE MARKETABILITY, AIRCRAFT MAY BE PLACED ON OPERATING LEASE. WHILE ON OPERATING LEASE, THE ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER FINANCING; HOWEVER, THE VALUATION CONTINUES TO BE BASED ON THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE LOWER OF

COST OR MARKET ASSESSMENT IS PERFORMED QUARTERLY USING THE PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

ASSET VALUATION FOR ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASE, ASSETS HELD

FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE AND COLLATERAL UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES

CUSTOMER FINANCING INCLUDES OPERATING LEASE EQUIPMENT, NOTES RECEIVABLES, AND SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES. SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES ARE TREATED AS RECEIVABLES, AND ALLOWANCES FOR

LOSSES ARE ESTABLISHED AS NECESSARY.

WE ASSESS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS WE OWN, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR

RE-LEASE, AND COLLATERAL UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES, TO DETERMINE IF THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE LESS

64

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THAN THE RELATED ASSETS CARRYING VALUES. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CARRYING VALUES AND FAIR VALUES OF FINANCE LEASES AND NOTES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, AS DETERMINED BY COLLATERAL VALUE, ARE

CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES.

WE USE A MEDIAN CALCULATED FROM PUBLISHED COLLATERAL VALUES FROM MULTIPLE

THIRD-PARTY AIRCRAFT VALUE PUBLICATIONS BASED ON THE TYPE AND AGE OF THE AIRCRAFT TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF AIRCRAFT. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WE APPLY JUDGMENT BASED ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT, USUALLY WHEN THE

FEATURES OR USE OF THE AIRCRAFT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE MORE GENERIC AIRCRAFT ATTRIBUTES COVERED BY OUTSIDE PUBLICATIONS.

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR

ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE

WE EVALUATE FOR IMPAIRMENT ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

FROM THE ASSET MAY BE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. WE USE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS WHEN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW INCLUDING OUR INTENTIONS FOR HOW LONG WE WILL HOLD AN ASSET SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASE BEFORE IT IS SOLD, THE

EXPECTED FUTURE LEASE RATES, LEASE TERMS, RESIDUAL VALUE OF THE ASSET, PERIODS IN WHICH THE ASSET MAY BE HELD IN PREPARATION FOR A FOLLOW-ON LEASE, MAINTENANCE COSTS, REMARKETING COSTS AND THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSET. WE STATE ASSETS

HELD FOR SALE AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING VALUE OR FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL.

WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT

OF IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE RECORDED IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON CUSTOMER FINANCING

RECEIVABLES

WE RECORD THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES IN OUR PORTFOLIO IN A VALUATION ACCOUNT, THE BALANCE OF WHICH IS AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE BUT UNCONFIRMED LOSSES IN THE RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO. THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES RELATES TO TWO COMPONENTS OF RECEIVABLES: (A) SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AND (B) ALL OTHER RECEIVABLES.

WE DETERMINE A RECEIVABLE IS IMPAIRED WHEN, BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION AND EVENTS, IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE

ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY SUBSEQUENT RESTRUCTURINGS. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING COLLECTIBILITY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, A CUSTOMERS EXTENDED DELINQUENCY, REQUESTS FOR

RESTRUCTURING AND FILINGS FOR BANKRUPTCY. WE DETERMINE A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL.

WE REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REMAINING RECEIVABLES (AFTER EXCLUDING RECEIVABLES SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCE) BY

ASSESSING BOTH THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AND THE APPLICABLE CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATE. COLLATERAL EXPOSURE FOR A PARTICULAR RECEIVABLE IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL. A RECEIVABLE WITH

AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE NO COLLATERAL EXPOSURE. THE APPLICABLE CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATE IS DETERMINED USING TWO COMPONENTS: CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACT TERM.

CREDIT RATINGS ARE DETERMINED FOR EACH CUSTOMER IN THE PORTFOLIO. THOSE RATINGS ARE UPDATED BASED UPON PUBLIC INFORMATION AND INFORMATION OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT WOULD ENTITLE US TO LOOK BEYOND THE SPECIFIC COLLATERAL UNDERLYING THE RECEIVABLE FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

SHOULD THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL ASSET RESULTING FROM A DEFAULT CONDITION BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR RECEIVABLE (CREATING A SHORTFALL CONDITION), THESE AGREEMENTS WOULD, FOR EXAMPLE, PERMIT US TO

TAKE THE ACTIONS NECESSARY TO SELL OR RETAIN CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS IN WHICH THE CUSTOMER HAS AN EQUITY INTEREST AND USE THE PROCEEDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL.

65

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EACH QUARTER WE REVIEW CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS, PUBLISHED HISTORICAL CREDIT DEFAULT RATES FOR DIFFERENT RATING

CATEGORIES, AND MULTIPLE THIRD PARTY AIRCRAFT VALUE PUBLICATIONS AS A BASIS TO VALIDATE THE REASONABLENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ACTUAL RESULTS WILL NOT DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES OR THAT THE

CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTORS IN THE FUTURE WILL NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES.

WARRANTIES

IN CONJUNCTION WITH CERTAIN PRODUCT SALES, WE PROVIDE WARRANTIES THAT COVER FACTORS SUCH AS NON-CONFORMANCE TO SPECIFICATIONS AND DEFECTS IN MATERIAL

AND DESIGN. THE MAJORITY OF OUR WARRANTIES ARE ISSUED BY OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT. GENERALLY, AIRCRAFT SALES ARE ACCOMPANIED BY A THREE TO FOUR-YEAR STANDARD WARRANTY FOR SYSTEMS, ACCESSORIES, EQUIPMENT, PARTS, AND SOFTWARE MANUFACTURED BY

US OR MANUFACTURED TO CERTAIN STANDARDS UNDER OUR AUTHORIZATION. THESE WARRANTIES ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAMS ESTIMATE AT COMPLETION. ADDITIONALLY, ON OCCASION WE HAVE MADE COMMITMENTS BEYOND THE STANDARD WARRANTY OBLIGATION TO CORRECT

FLEET-WIDE MAJOR ISSUES OF A PARTICULAR MODEL. THESE COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. WARRANTIES ISSUED BY OUR BDS SEGMENTS PRINCIPALLY RELATE TO SALES OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND WEAPONS HARDWARE AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACT COST ESTIMATES. THESE

SALES ARE GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A SIX TO TWELVE-MONTH WARRANTY PERIOD AND COVER SYSTEMS, ACCESSORIES, EQUIPMENT, PARTS, AND SOFTWARE MANUFACTURED BY US TO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL SPECIFICATIONS. ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO STANDARD WARRANTIES ARE

RECORDED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE RELATED PRODUCT SALES OCCUR. THE WARRANTY LIABILITY RECORDED AT EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF MONTHS OF WARRANTY COVERAGE OUTSTANDING FOR PRODUCTS DELIVERED TIMES THE AVERAGE OF

HISTORICAL MONTHLY WARRANTY PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS FOR CERTAIN MAJOR WARRANTY ISSUES THAT EXCEED A NORMAL CLAIMS LEVEL. ESTIMATED COSTS OF THESE ADDITIONAL WARRANTY ISSUES ARE CONSIDERED CHANGES TO THE INITIAL LIABILITY ESTIMATE.

SUPPLIER PENALTIES

WE RECORD AN ACCRUAL FOR

SUPPLIER PENALTIES WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS THAT MAKES IT PROBABLE THAT A SUPPLIER PENALTY WILL BE INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. UNTIL AN EVENT OCCURS, WE FULLY ANTICIPATE ACCEPTING ALL PRODUCTS PROCURED UNDER PRODUCTION-RELATED

CONTRACTS.

GUARANTEES

WE RECORD A LIABILITY IN

OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF GUARANTEES THAT ARE ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002. FOR A RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE WHERE WE RECEIVED A CASH PREMIUM, THE LIABILITY IS EQUAL TO THE CASH PREMIUM RECEIVED AT THE

GUARANTEES INCEPTION. FOR CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES, THE LIABILITY IS EQUAL TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED LOSS. WE DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LOSS BY MULTIPLYING THE CREDITORS DEFAULT RATE BY THE GUARANTEE AMOUNT REDUCED BY

THE EXPECTED RECOVERY, IF APPLICABLE, FOR EACH FUTURE PERIOD THE CREDIT OR PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE WILL BE OUTSTANDING. IF AT INCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE, WE DETERMINE THERE IS A PROBABLE RELATED CONTINGENT LOSS, WE WILL RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY FOR THE

GREATER OF (A) THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE OR (B) THE PROBABLE CONTINGENT LOSS AMOUNT.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WAS $1,787 AND $1,453, OF

WHICH $1,452 AND $1,171 WOULD AFFECT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, IF RECOGNIZED. THESE AMOUNTS ARE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. FEDERAL TAX ISSUES SUCH AS THE TAX BENEFITS FROM THE FOREIGN SALES CORPORATION/EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME (FSC/ETI) TAX RULES,

THE AMOUNT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS CLAIMED, U.S. TAXATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS, AND VALUATION ISSUES REGARDING CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS CLAIMED. ALSO INCLUDED IN THESE AMOUNTS ARE ACCRUALS FOR DOMESTIC STATE TAX ISSUES SUCH AS THE

ALLOCATION OF INCOME AMONG VARIOUS STATE TAX JURISDICTIONS AND THE AMOUNT OF STATE TAX CREDITS CLAIMED.

AUDIT OUTCOMES AND THE TIMING OF AUDIT

SETTLEMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WE WILL RESOLVE SOME OR ALL OF THE MATTERS PRESENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION FOR 1998-2006 WITH THE IRS. DEPENDING ON THE TIMING AND OUTCOMES OF

THE AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS THAT AFFECT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE COULD INCREASE EARNINGS BY UP TO $600 BASED ON CURRENT ESTIMATES.

THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2009. CONGRESS IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING BILLS THAT WILL EXTEND THE CREDIT. IF THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT IS NOT LEGISLATIVELY ENACTED THERE WOULD BE AN UNFAVORABLE

IMPACT ON OUR 2010 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE.

RIGHTS TO REIMBURSEMENT FROM SEA LAUNCH AS WELL AS THE OTHER SEA LAUNCH PARTNERS, WHO ARE EACH OBLIGATED TO REIMBURSE US SO THAT WE CONTRIBUTE NO MORE THAN OUR PROPORTIONAL OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGE (40% OR $179) IN SEA LAUNCH OF THE AGGREGATE GUARANTEE

PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS. ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2009, AN AFFILIATE OF AKER EXECUTED A PROMISSORY NOTE WHICH OBLIGATES IT TO PAY US $122 IN THREE PAYMENTS. THE FIRST PAYMENT OF $40 WAS RECEIVED IN DECEMBER 2009 AND THE FINAL TWO PAYMENTS ARE DUE IN 2010.

ON OCTOBER 19, 2009, WE FILED A NOTICE OF ARBITRATION WITH THE STOCKHOLM CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE OTHER SEA LAUNCH PARTNERS OF THE REMAINING $147 RELATED TO OUR GUARANTEE PAYMENT.

IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THE SEA LAUNCH BANKRUPTCY, $523 OF PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH A LOAN BY BCSC ALSO BECOME REPAYABLE BY SEA LAUNCH. CERTAIN

OTHER SEA LAUNCH PARTNERS HAVE GUARANTEED PORTIONS OF THIS LOAN (COLLECTIVELY, 40% OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT IS GUARANTEED). WE HAVE ALSO FILED CERTAIN PROOFS OF CLAIM IN THE BANKRUPTCY ON ACCOUNT OF VARIOUS GOODS AND SERVICES PROVIDED TO SEA LAUNCH PRIOR

TO THE BANKRUPTCY FILING.

WE INTEND TO PURSUE VIGOROUSLY ALL OF OUR RIGHTS AND REMEDIES AGAINST SEA LAUNCH AND THE OTHER SEA LAUNCH PARTNERS WITH

RESPECT TO THE AMOUNTS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AIRCRAFT UPON THE PURCHASE OF SALE AIRCRAFT. THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN VALUE WAS $427 AND $1,045 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008. WE ANTICIPATE THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE

COMMITMENTS WILL NOT BE EXERCISED BY CUSTOMERS.

THE PROBABILITY THAT TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WILL BE EXERCISED IS DETERMINED BY USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE

INFORMATION FROM VALUATION SOURCES AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES. THE PROBABILITY OF EXERCISE IS CONTINUALLY ASSESSED, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS, WHICH CAN BE TERMINATED BY

MUTUAL CONSENT WITH THE CUSTOMER, MAY BE EXERCISED ONLY DURING THE PERIOD SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT, AND REQUIRE ADVANCE NOTICE BY THE CUSTOMER. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT RELATED TO PROBABLE CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WAS

$34 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. TRADE-IN COMMITMENT AGREEMENTS HAVE EXPIRATION DATES FROM 2010 THROUGH 2023.

FUTURE LEASE COMMITMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, FUTURE LEASE COMMITMENTS ON AIRCRAFT AND OTHER COMMITMENTS NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

FINANCIAL POSITION TOTALED $159 AND $197. THESE LEASE COMMITMENTS EXTEND THROUGH 2020, AND OUR INTENT IS TO RECOVER THESE LEASE COMMITMENTS THROUGH SUBLEASE ARRANGEMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE FUTURE LEASE COMMITMENTS ON AIRCRAFT FOR

EACH OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WERE AS FOLLOWS: $16 IN 2010, $16 IN 2011, $16 IN 2012, $16 IN 2013, AND $16 IN 2014. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES INCLUDED $14 AND $32 ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADVERSE COMMITMENTS UNDER THESE

LEASE ARRANGEMENTS.

FINANCING COMMITMENTS

FINANCING COMMITMENTS TOTALED $10,409 AND $10,145 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008. WE ANTICIPATE THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE COMMITMENTS WILL NOT BE EXERCISED BY THE CUSTOMERS AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THIRD PARTY FINANCIERS

TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE FINANCING TO CUSTOMERS. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCES THAT WE WILL NOT BE REQUIRED TO FUND GREATER AMOUNTS THAN HISTORICALLY REQUIRED.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FORMATION OF ULA, WE AND LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION (LOCKHEED) EACH AGREED TO EXTEND A LINE OF CREDIT TO ULA OF UP TO $200 TO SUPPORT ITS WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DURING THE FIVE-YEAR

PERIOD FOLLOWING DECEMBER 1, 2006. ULA DID NOT REQUEST ANY FUNDS UNDER THE LINE OF CREDIT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. WE AND LOCKHEED HAVE ALSO EACH COMMITTED TO PROVIDE ULA WITH UP TO $122 OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE EVENT ULA

DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO MAKE A REQUIRED PAYMENT TO US UNDER AN INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT. SEE NOTE 7.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO STANDBY LETTERS

OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND SURETY BONDS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRIMARILY RELATING TO THE GUARANTEE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE ON CERTAIN CONTRACTS. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ON OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND SURETY BONDS AGGREGATED

APPROXIMATELY $7,052 AND $5,763 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008.

C-17

AIRCRAFT NOT INCLUDED IN BACKLOG, PRIMARILY THE 8 FY09 AIRCRAFT, TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $375. SHOULD ADDITIONAL ORDERS NOT MATERIALIZE, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL DECIDE IN 2010 TO COMPLETE PRODUCTION OF THE C-17. WE ARE STILL EVALUATING

IMPACT OF A POTENTIAL PRODUCTION SHUT-DOWN, INCLUDING ANY RECOVERY THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. SUCH RECOVERY FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT INCLUDE THE COSTS INCURRED BY

US RESULTING FROM OUR DIRECTION TO SUPPLIERS TO BEGIN WORKING ON AIRCRAFT BEYOND THOSE CURRENTLY UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE USAF.

SATELLITES

CERTAIN LAUNCH AND SATELLITE SALES CONTRACTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT SPECIFY THAT WE BEAR RISK OF LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAUNCH PHASE THROUGH

ACCEPTANCE IN ORBIT BY THE CUSTOMER. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY PURCHASED INSURANCE TO COVER THESE EXPOSURES WHEN ALLOWED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT AND WHEN ECONOMICALLY ADVISABLE. THE CURRENT INSURANCE MARKET REFLECTS HIGH PREMIUM RATES AND ALSO

SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF CAPACITY TO HANDLE ALL INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. WE MAKE DECISIONS ON THE PROCUREMENT OF INSURANCE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF RISK. THERE IS A CONTRACTUAL LAUNCH SCHEDULED FOR 2010 FOR WHICH FULL INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE

AVAILABLE OR, IF AVAILABLE, COULD BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW THIS RISK. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE POTENTIAL UNINSURED AMOUNT FOR THIS LAUNCH COULD BE APPROXIMATELY $360.

COMPANY OWNED LIFE INSURANCE

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION

INSURED ITS EXECUTIVES WITH COMPANY OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (COLI), WHICH ARE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES WITH A CASH SURRENDER VALUE. ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT USE COLI CURRENTLY, THESE OBLIGATIONS FROM THE MERGER WITH MCDONNELL DOUGLAS ARE STILL A COMMITMENT AT

THIS TIME. WE HAVE LOANS IN PLACE TO COVER COSTS PAID OR INCURRED TO CARRY THE UNDERLYING LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE WAS $360 AND $331 AND THE TOTAL LOANS WERE $337 AND $317. AS WE HAVE

THE RIGHT TO OFFSET THE LOANS AGAINST THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF THE POLICIES, WE PRESENT THE NET ASSET IN OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008.

CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS

WE HAVE

ENTERED INTO CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNING DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS FOR THE SALE OF NEW AIRCRAFT (SALE AIRCRAFT). UNDER THESE COMMITMENTS, WE AGREED TO REPURCHASE THE SALE AIRCRAFT AT A SPECIFIED

PRICE, GENERALLY 10 YEARS AFTER DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT. OUR REPURCHASE OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT IS CONTINGENT UPON A FUTURE, MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT, AND THE SUBSEQUENT EXERCISE BY THE CUSTOMER OF ITS

RIGHT TO SELL THE SALE AIRCRAFT TO US. THE REPURCHASE PRICE SPECIFIED IN CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS IS GENERALLY LOWER THAN THE EXPECTED FAIR VALUE AT THE SPECIFIED REPURCHASE DATE. ESTIMATED PROCEEDS FROM COLLATERAL/RECOURSE IN THE TABLE

ABOVE REPRESENT THE LOWER OF THE CONTRACTED REPURCHASE PRICE OR THE EXPECTED FAIR VALUE OF EACH AIRCRAFT AT THE SPECIFIED REPURCHASE DATE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS TO ULA

WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ULA AGAINST LOSSES IN THE EVENT THAT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH $1,360 OF DELTA LAUNCH PROGRAM INVENTORIES INCLUDED IN CONTRIBUTED ASSETS AND $1,860 OF DELTA PROGRAM INVENTORIES SUBJECT TO AN

INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT ARE NOT RECOVERABLE AND ALLOWABLE FROM EXISTING AND FUTURE ORDERS. THE TERM OF THE INVENTORY INDEMNIFICATION EXTENDS TO DECEMBER 31, 2020. SINCE INCEPTION, ULA HAS CONSUMED $1,111 OF INVENTORIES THAT WERE CONTRIBUTED

BY US AND HAS MADE ADVANCES OF $120 TO US UNDER THE INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT. THE TABLE ABOVE INCLUDES INDEMNIFICATIONS TO ULA FOR CONTRIBUTED DELTA LAUNCH PROGRAM INVENTORY OF $277 AND $813, PLUS $348 RELATED TO THE PRICING OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS

AND $57 AND $23 RELATED TO MISCELLANEOUS DELTA CONTRACTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008.

WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ULA AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT

ULA MAY INCUR IN THE EVENT ULA IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN CERTAIN ADDITIONAL CONTRACT PRICING FROM THE USAF FOR FOUR SATELLITE MISSIONS. WE BELIEVE ULA IS ENTITLED TO ADDITIONAL CONTRACT PRICING. IN DECEMBER 2008, ULA SUBMITTED A CLAIM TO THE USAF TO

RE-PRICE THE CONTRACT VALUE FOR TWO OF THE FOUR SATELLITE MISSIONS COVERED BY THE INDEMNIFICATION. IN MARCH 2009, THE USAF ISSUED A DENIAL OF THAT CLAIM AND IN JUNE 2009, ULA FILED AN APPEAL. DURING 2009, THE USAF EXERCISED ITS OPTION FOR A THIRD

SATELLITE MISSION. ULA INTENDS TO SUBMIT A CLAIM TO THE USAF IN 2010 TO RE-PRICE THE CONTRACT VALUE OF THE THIRD MISSION. IF ULA IS UNSUCCESSFUL OBTAINING ADDITIONAL PRICING, WE MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A PORTION OF THE SHORTFALL AND MAY RECORD UP TO

$382 IN PRE-TAX LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE FOUR MISSIONS.

OTHER CREDIT GUARANTEES

WE HAVE ISSUED CREDIT GUARANTEES, PRINCIPALLY TO FACILITATE

THE SALE AND/OR FINANCING OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO A GUARANTEED PARTY IN THE EVENT THAT LEASE OR LOAN PAYMENTS ARE NOT MADE BY THE ORIGINAL LESSEE OR DEBTOR OR CERTAIN SPECIFIED SERVICES

ARE NOT PERFORMED. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THESE GUARANTEES HAS BEEN EXTENDED ON BEHALF OF ORIGINAL LESSEES OR DEBTORS WITH LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CREDIT-RELATED GUARANTEES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY THE UNDERLYING

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS. CURRENT OUTSTANDING CREDIT GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHIN THE NEXT 11 YEARS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES

WE HAVE ISSUED VARIOUS RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES PRINCIPALLY TO FACILITATE THE SALE

AND FINANCING OF CERTAIN COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. UNDER THESE GUARANTEES, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE GUARANTEED PARTY IF THE RELATED AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT FAIR VALUES FALL BELOW A SPECIFIED AMOUNT AT A FUTURE TIME. THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE

COLLATERALIZED PRINCIPALLY BY COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND EXPIRE WITHIN THE NEXT 9 YEARS.

OTHER INDEMNIFICATIONS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR SALES OF THE ELECTRON DYNAMIC DEVICES, INC. AND ROCKETDYNE PROPULSION AND POWER BUSINESSES AND THE SALE OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES FACILITIES

IN WICHITA, KANSAS AND TULSA AND MCALESTER, OKLAHOMA IN 2005, WE PROVIDED INDEMNIFICATIONS TO THE BUYERS RELATING TO PRE-CLOSING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS. THE TERMS OF THE INDEMNIFICATIONS ARE INDEFINITE. AS IT IS

IMPOSSIBLE TO ASSESS WHETHER THERE WILL BE DAMAGES IN THE FUTURE OR THE AMOUNTS THEREOF (IF ANY), WE CANNOT ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER THESE GUARANTEES. THEREFORE, NO LIABILITY HAS BEEN RECORDED.

INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS

INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS (IRBS)

ISSUED BY THE CITY OF WICHITA ARE USED TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE AND/OR CONSTRUCTION OF REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY AT OUR WICHITA SITE. TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH IRBS INCLUDE A TEN-YEAR PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT AND A SALES TAX EXEMPTION FROM THE

KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE. WE RECORD THE PROPERTY ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION, ALONG WITH A CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION TO REPAY THE PROCEEDS OF THE IRB. WE HAVE ALSO PURCHASED THE IRBS AND THEREFORE ARE THE BONDHOLDERS AS

WELL AS THE BORROWER/LESSEE OF THE PROPERTY PURCHASED WITH THE IRB PROCEEDS.

THE CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION AND IRB ASSET ARE RECORDED NET IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CITY OF WICHITA IRBS WERE $856 AND $887.

NOTE 14  POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

WE HAVE VARIOUS PENSION PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES. WE FUND OUR MAJOR PENSION PLANS THROUGH TRUSTS. PENSION ASSETS ARE PLACED IN TRUST

SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PLANS PARTICIPANTS, AND ARE STRUCTURED TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO PAY BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS TO KEEP PACE OVER THE LONG TERM WITH THE GROWTH OF OBLIGATIONS FOR FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

WE ALSO HAVE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS WHICH CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING

DEPENDENTS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, LIFE INSURANCE TO CERTAIN GROUPS OF RETIREES. RETIREE HEALTH CARE IS PROVIDED PRINCIPALLY UNTIL AGE 65 FOR APPROXIMATELY HALF THOSE RETIREES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. CERTAIN EMPLOYEE GROUPS,

INCLUDING EMPLOYEES COVERED BY MOST UNITED AUTO WORKERS BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, ARE PROVIDED LIFETIME HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.

THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE

PLANS IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PLAN ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE AND THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION (PBO). WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE AGGREGATE OF ALL OVERFUNDED PLANS IN PENSION PLAN ASSETS, NET AND THE AGGREGATE OF ALL UNDERFUNDED PLANS IN

EITHER ACCRUED RETIREE HEALTH CARE OR ACCRUED PENSION PLAN LIABILITY, NET. THE PORTION OF THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE ACTUARIAL PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFITS INCLUDED IN THE PBO EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS, PAYABLE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, IS

REFLECTED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES.

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2008, A NEW ACCOUNTING STANDARD ON DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

PLANS REQUIRES US TO MEASURE PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT FISCAL YEAR END. WE PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED THIS MEASUREMENT AT SEPTEMBER 30 OF EACH YEAR. BEGINNING IN FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS STANDARD, WE ELIMINATED THE

USE OF A THREE-MONTH LAG PERIOD WHEN RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT OF CURTAILMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS AND, INSTEAD, RECOGNIZE THESE AMOUNTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. AS A RESULT OF IMPLEMENTING THE MEASUREMENT DATE PROVISIONS OF THIS STANDARD, WE

RECORDED AN ADDITIONAL QUARTER OF PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT (OPB) COST AS OF JANUARY 1, 2008 AS A $178 DECREASE TO RETAINED EARNINGS AND A $92 DECREASE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS, WHICH RESULTED IN A NET DECREASE OF

$86 TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS STANDARD DO NOT PERMIT RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION.

THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR EACH PENSION PLAN IS DETERMINED BY DISCOUNTING THE PLANS EXPECTED FUTURE BENEFIT

PAYMENTS USING A YIELD CURVE DEVELOPED FROM HIGH QUALITY BONDS THAT ARE RATED AS AA OR BETTER BY MOODYS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE YIELD CURVE IS FITTED TO YIELDS DEVELOPED FROM BONDS AT VARIOUS MATURITY POINTS. BONDS WITH THE TEN PERCENT

HIGHEST AND THE TEN PERCENT LOWEST YIELDS ARE OMITTED. A PORTFOLIO OF ABOUT 400 BONDS IS USED TO CONSTRUCT THE YIELD CURVE. SINCE CORPORATE BOND YIELDS ARE GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE AT MATURITIES BEYOND 30 YEARS, IT IS ASSUMED THAT SPOT RATES WILL

REMAIN LEVEL BEYOND THAT 30-YEAR POINT. THE PRESENT VALUE OF EACH PLANS BENEFITS IS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE SPOT/DISCOUNT RATES TO PROJECTED BENEFIT CASH FLOWS. ALL BONDS ARE U.S. ISSUES, WITH A MINIMUM OUTSTANDING OF $50.

THE DISCLOSED RATE IS THE AVERAGE RATE FOR ALL THE PLANS, WEIGHTED BY THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE WAS 5.80%,

AND THE RATES FOR INDIVIDUAL PLANS RANGED FROM 3.80% TO 6.40%. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2008, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE WAS 6.10%, AND THE RATES FOR INDIVIDUAL PLANS RANGED FROM 4.25% TO 6.60%.

THE PENSION FUNDS EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION IS DERIVED FROM A REVIEW OF ACTUAL HISTORICAL RETURNS ACHIEVED BY THE PENSION TRUST AND ANTICIPATED

FUTURE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL ASSET CLASSES. WHILE CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO RECENT TRUST PERFORMANCE AND HISTORICAL RETURNS,

88

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ASSUMPTION REPRESENTS A LONG-TERM, PROSPECTIVE RETURN. THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS COMPONENT OF THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST FOR THE UPCOMING PLAN YEAR IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE

EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION AND THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS (MRVA). SINCE OUR ADOPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING STANDARD FOR PENSIONS IN 1987, WE HAVE DETERMINED THE MRVA BASED ON A FIVE-YEAR MOVING AVERAGE OF PLAN ASSETS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009, THE MRVA IS APPROXIMATELY $3,700 GREATER THAN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS.

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR THE HEALTH CARE

PLANS. TO DETERMINE THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES WE LOOK AT A COMBINATION OF INFORMATION INCLUDING ONGOING CLAIMS COST MONITORING, ANNUAL STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF CLAIMS DATA, RECONCILIATION OF FORECAST CLAIMS AGAINST ACTUAL CLAIMS, REVIEW OF

TREND ASSUMPTIONS OF OTHER PLAN SPONSORS AND NATIONAL HEALTH TRENDS, AND ADJUSTMENTS FOR PLAN DESIGN CHANGES, WORKFORCE CHANGES, AND CHANGES IN PLAN PARTICIPANT BEHAVIOR. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT CHANGE IN ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES WOULD

HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECT.

INVESTMENT STRATEGY

THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF OUR PENSION ASSETS IS TO EARN A RATE OF RETURN OVER TIME TO SATISFY THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF THE PENSION PLANS AND TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO PAY BENEFITS AND ADDRESS OTHER CASH

REQUIREMENTS OF THE PENSION FUND. SPECIFIC INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES FOR OUR LONG-TERM INVESTMENT STRATEGY INCLUDE REDUCING THE VOLATILITY OF PENSION ASSETS RELATIVE TO PENSION LIABILITIES, ACHIEVING A COMPETITIVE, TOTAL INVESTMENT RETURN, ACHIEVING

DIVERSIFICATION BETWEEN AND WITHIN ASSET CLASSES AND MANAGING OTHER RISKS. INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES FOR EACH ASSET CLASS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON SPECIFIC RISKS AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED.

WE UPDATE OUR LONG-TERM, STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS EVERY THREE-TO-FIVE YEARS. WE USE VARIOUS ANALYTICS TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL ASSET MIX AND CONSIDER PLAN

LIABILITY CHARACTERISTICS, LIQUIDITY CHARACTERISTICS, FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, EXPECTED RATES OF RETURN AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF RETURNS. WE IDENTIFY INVESTMENT BENCHMARKS FOR THE ASSET CLASSES IN THE STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION THAT ARE MARKET-BASED AND

INVESTABLE WHERE POSSIBLE.

ACTUAL ALLOCATIONS TO EACH ASSET CLASS VARY FROM TARGET ALLOCATIONS DUE TO PERIODIC INVESTMENT STRATEGY CHANGES, MARKET

VALUE FLUCTUATIONS, THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO FULLY IMPLEMENT INVESTMENT ALLOCATION POSITIONS (SUCH AS PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE), AND THE TIMING OF BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS. SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES

ARE USED TO REBALANCE THE ACTUAL ASSET ALLOCATION TO THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION. THE ASSET ALLOCATION IS MONITORED AND REBALANCED ON A MONTHLY BASIS.

FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ARE INVESTED BROADLY AND PRIMARILY IN LONG DURATION INSTRUMENTS. GLOBAL EQUITY

SECURITIES ARE INVESTED BROADLY IN U.S. AND NON-U.S. COMPANIES WHICH ARE IN VARIOUS INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES AND THROUGH A RANGE OF MARKET CAPITALIZATIONS.

REAL ESTATE AND REAL ASSETS INCLUDE GLOBAL PRIVATE INVESTMENTS AND PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS (SUCH AS REITS IN THE CASE OF REAL ESTATE). REAL ESTATE INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO INVESTMENTS IN OFFICE, RETAIL, APARTMENT AND INDUSTRIAL

PROPERTIES. REAL ASSETS INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO INVESTMENTS IN NATURAL RESOURCES (SUCH AS ENERGY, FARMLAND AND TIMBER) AND INFRASTRUCTURE. PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT VEHICLES ARE PRIMARILY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS (LPS) AND FUND-OF-FUNDS THAT

MAINLY INVEST IN U.S. AND NON-U.S. LEVERAGED BUYOUT, VENTURE CAPITAL AND SPECIAL SITUATION STRATEGIES.

GLOBAL STRATEGIES SEEK TO CAPITALIZE ON

INEFFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED ACROSS DIFFERENT ASSET CLASSES OR MARKETS, PRIMARILY USING LONG-SHORT POSITIONS IN DERIVATIVES AND PHYSICAL SECURITIES. HEDGE FUND STRATEGY TYPES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO EVENT DRIVEN, RELATIVE VALUE, LONG-SHORT AND

MARKET NEUTRAL. A WELL-DIVERSIFIED NUMBER OF HEDGE FUNDS ARE HELD.

INVESTMENT MANAGERS ARE RETAINED FOR EXPLICIT INVESTMENT ROLES SPECIFIED BY

CONTRACTUAL INVESTMENT GUIDELINES. CERTAIN INVESTMENT MANAGERS ARE AUTHORIZED TO INVEST IN DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS EQUITY OR BOND FUTURES, SWAPS, OPTIONS AND CURRENCY FUTURES OR FORWARDS. DERIVATIVES ARE USED TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED MARKET EXPOSURE OF A

SECURITY OR AN INDEX, TRANSFER VALUE-ADDED PERFORMANCE BETWEEN ASSET CLASSES, ACHIEVE THE DESIRED CURRENCY EXPOSURE, ADJUST PORTFOLIO DURATION OR REBALANCE THE TOTAL PORTFOLIO TO THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL PLAN ASSETS, DERIVATIVE NET NOTIONAL AMOUNTS WERE 6.0% AND 6.2% FOR FIXED INCOME, INCLUDING TO-BE-ANNOUNCED MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND

TREASURY FORWARDS, AND 0.0% AND 7.9% FOR GLOBAL EQUITY AND CURRENCY OVERLAY AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008.

IN NOVEMBER 2009, THE COMPANY ELECTED

TO CONTRIBUTE $1,500 OF OUR COMMON STOCK TO THE PENSION FUND. AN INDEPENDENT FIDUCIARY WAS RETAINED TO MANAGE AND LIQUIDATE THE STOCK OVER TIME AT ITS DISCRETION. PLAN ASSETS INCLUDED $1,581 AND $0 OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009

AND 2008.

RISK MANAGEMENT

IN MANAGING THE PLAN ASSETS, WE REVIEW AND MANAGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FUNDED STATUS RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, MARKET

RISK, COUNTERPARTY RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK. LIABILITY MANAGEMENT AND ASSET CLASS DIVERSIFICATION ARE CENTRAL TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH AND ARE INTEGRAL TO THE OVERALL INVESTMENT STRATEGY. FURTHER, ASSET CLASSES ARE

CONSTRUCTED TO ACHIEVE DIVERSIFICATION BY INVESTMENT STRATEGY, BY INVESTMENT MANAGER, BY INDUSTRY OR SECTOR AND BY HOLDING.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE FOLLOWING TABLE PRESENTS OUR PLAN ASSETS USING THE FAIR VALUE

HIERARCHY AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY HAS THREE LEVELS BASED ON THE RELIABILITY OF THE INPUTS USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE. LEVEL 1 REFERS TO FAIR VALUES DETERMINED BASED ON QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL

ASSETS. LEVEL 2 REFERS TO FAIR VALUES ESTIMATED USING SIGNIFICANT OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS, AND LEVEL 3 INCLUDES FAIR VALUES ESTIMATED USING SIGNIFICANT NON-OBSERVABLE INPUTS.

SOME OF

OUR ASSETS, PRIMARILY OUR PRIVATE EQUITY, REAL ESTATE AND REAL ASSETS, HEDGE FUNDS AND GLOBAL STRATEGIES, DO NOT HAVE READILY DETERMINABLE MARKET VALUES GIVEN THE SPECIFIC INVESTMENT STRUCTURES INVOLVED AND THE NATURE OF THE UNDERLYING INVESTMENTS.

FOR THE DECEMBER 31, 2009 PLAN ASSET REPORTING, PUBLICLY TRADED ASSET PRICING WAS USED WHERE POSSIBLE. FOR ASSETS WITHOUT READILY DETERMINABLE VALUES, ESTIMATES WERE DERIVED FROM INVESTMENT MANAGER DISCUSSIONS FOCUSING ON UNDERLYING

FUNDAMENTALS AND SIGNIFICANT EVENTS. FOR THOSE INVESTMENTS REPORTED ON A ONE-QUARTER LAGGED BASIS (PRIMARILY LPS) WE USE NET ASSET VALUES, ADJUSTED FOR SUBSEQUENT CASH FLOWS AND SIGNIFICANT EVENTS.

OPB PLAN ASSETS

THE MAJORITY OF OPB PLAN ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN A BALANCED INDEX FUND WHICH IS COMPRISED OF

APPROXIMATELY 60% EQUITIES AND 40% DEBT SECURITIES. THE INDEX FUND IS VALUED USING A MARKET APPROACH BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF AN IDENTICAL INSTRUMENT (LEVEL 1). THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON THESE ASSETS DOES NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST.

CASH FLOWS

CONTRIBUTIONS

REQUIRED PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AS WELL AS RULES GOVERNING FUNDING OF OUR NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS, ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL IN 2010. IN 2010 REQUIRED

CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PENSION PLANS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO EXCEED $100. WE EXPECT THAT IF INTEREST RATES REMAIN AT THEIR CURRENT LEVELS, DISCOUNT RATES FOR ERISA DETERMINATIONS WILL LIKELY DECLINE IN FUTURE YEARS BECAUSE OF RETROSPECTIVE AVERAGING, AND

AS A RESULT, CONTRIBUTIONS IN FUTURE YEARS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE. WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $14 TO OUR OPB PLANS IN 2010.

ESTIMATED

FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS

THE TABLE BELOW REFLECTS THE TOTAL PENSION BENEFITS EXPECTED TO BE PAID FROM THE PLANS OR FROM OUR ASSETS, INCLUDING BOTH OUR SHARE OF THE BENEFIT COST AND THE PARTICIPANTS SHARE OF THE COST, WHICH IS FUNDED BY

TERMINATION PROVISIONS

CERTAIN OF THE PENSION PLANS PROVIDE THAT, IN THE EVENT THERE IS A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY WHICH IS NOT APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE PLANS ARE TERMINATED WITHIN FIVE YEARS THEREAFTER, THE

ASSETS IN THE PLAN FIRST WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS REQUIRED BY ERISA, AND THEN ANY SURPLUS WILL BE USED TO FUND A TRUST TO CONTINUE PRESENT AND FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE

BENEFITS IN OUR GROUP INSURANCE BENEFIT PROGRAMS.

WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN PENSION PLANS. UNDER THE

AGREEMENT, SHOULD WE TERMINATE ANY OF THE PLANS UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE PLANS ASSETS EXCEED THAT PLANS OBLIGATIONS, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL BE ENTITLED TO A FAIR ALLOCATION OF ANY OF THE PLANS ASSETS BASED ON PLAN

CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE REIMBURSED UNDER U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

401(K) PLANS

WE PROVIDE CERTAIN DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS TO ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. THE PRINCIPAL PLANS ARE THE COMPANY-SPONSORED 401(K) PLANS. THE EXPENSE FOR THESE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS WAS $591, $571 AND $536 IN 2009,

2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

OUR 2003 INCENTIVE

STOCK PLAN, AS AMENDED ON APRIL 27, 2009, PERMITS AWARDS OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE SHARES, PERFORMANCE UNITS AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, CONSULTANTS

AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR STOCK AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE AMENDED PLAN WILL NOT EXCEED 80,000,000 AND NO MORE THAN AN AGGREGATE OF 16,000,000 SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS RESTRICTED STOCK

AWARDS.

SHARES ISSUED AS A RESULT OF STOCK OPTION EXERCISES OR CONVERSION OF STOCK UNIT AWARDS WILL BE FUNDED OUT OF TREASURY SHARES EXCEPT TO THE

EXTENT THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT TREASURY SHARES IN WHICH CASE NEW SHARES WILL BE ISSUED. WE BELIEVE WE CURRENTLY HAVE ADEQUATE TREASURY SHARES TO MEET ANY REQUIREMENTS TO ISSUE SHARES DURING 2010.

SHARE-BASED PLANS EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY INCLUDED IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE SINCE IT IS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ISSUED PRIMARILY TO OUR EXECUTIVES. THE

SERVICE PERIOD WITH PORTIONS OF A GRANT BECOMING EXERCISABLE AT ONE YEAR, THREE YEARS AND FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT. IN THE EVENT AN EMPLOYEE HAS A TERMINATION OF EMPLOYMENT DUE TO RETIREMENT, LAYOFF, DISABILITY OR DEATH, THE EMPLOYEE (OR

BENEFICIARY) IMMEDIATELY VESTS IN GRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR.

ON FEBRUARY 23, 2009, FEBRUARY 25, 2008, AND

FEBRUARY 26, 2007, WE GRANTED TO OUR EXECUTIVES 7,423,242, 6,411,300, AND 5,334,700 OPTIONS, RESPECTIVELY, WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF OUR STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT. THE STOCK OPTIONS VEST OVER A PERIOD OF THREE

THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF THE STOCK OPTIONS IS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF OUR HISTORICAL STOCK VOLATILITY AND

THE VOLATILITY LEVELS IMPLIED ON THE GRANT DATE BY ACTIVELY TRADED OPTION CONTRACTS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. WE DETERMINED THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE STOCK OPTION GRANTS TO BE 6 YEARS, CALCULATED USING THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH

THE SEC STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN 107,

VALUATION OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES

. WE USED THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD SINCE WE CHANGED THE VESTING TERMS, TAX TREATMENT AND THE RECIPIENTS OF OUR STOCK OPTIONS

BEGINNING IN 2006 SUCH THAT WE BELIEVE OUR HISTORICAL DATA NO LONGER PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS UPON WHICH TO ESTIMATE EXPECTED TERM.

RESTRICTED

STOCK UNITS AND OTHER AWARDS

IN 2009, WE MODIFIED THE COMPONENTS OF OUR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM WHILE MAINTAINING SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TOTAL

AWARD VALUE AS IN PRIOR YEARS. PRIOR TO THE MODIFICATION, PERFORMANCE AWARDS AND OPTIONS EACH COMPRISED 50% OF THE TOTAL AWARD VALUE. BEGINNING IN 2009, PERFORMANCE AWARDS STILL REPRESENT 50% OF THE VALUE AND STOCK OPTIONS AND RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

(RSUS) EACH REPRESENT 25% OF THE TOTAL VALUE.

95

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON FEBRUARY 23, 2009, WE GRANTED TO OUR EXECUTIVES 2,144,501 RSUS AS PART OF OUR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM,

WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $35.57 PER SHARE. THE RSUS VEST ON THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRANT DATE. IF AN EXECUTIVE TERMINATES EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE OF RETIREMENT, INVOLUNTARY LAYOFF, DISABILITY, OR DEATH, THE EMPLOYEE (OR BENEFICIARY) WILL IMMEDIATELY

VEST ON A PRORATION OF STOCK UNITS BASED ON ACTIVE EMPLOYMENT DURING THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. IN ALL OTHER CASES, THE RSUS WILL NOT VEST AND ALL RIGHTS TO THE STOCK UNITS WILL TERMINATE COMPLETELY.

IN ADDITION TO RSUS AWARDED UNDER OUR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM, WE GRANT RESTRICTED STOCK TO EMPLOYEES FOR VARIOUS ACHIEVEMENTS, REFERRED TO AS OTHER STOCK AWARD

UNITS. THE FAIR VALUES OF ALL STOCK UNITS ARE ESTIMATED USING THE AVERAGE STOCK PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT. STOCK UNITS SETTLE IN COMMON STOCK ON A ONE-FOR-ONE BASIS AND ARE NOT CONTINGENT UPON STOCK PRICE.

SHAREVALUE TRUST

THE SHAREVALUE TRUST, ESTABLISHED EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 1996, IS A 14-YEAR IRREVOCABLE TRUST THAT HOLDS OUR COMMON STOCK, RECEIVES DIVIDENDS, AND DISTRIBUTES TO EMPLOYEES THE APPRECIATION IN VALUE ABOVE A 3% PER ANNUM THRESHOLD RATE

OF RETURN AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD. THE TOTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRUST WAS DETERMINED USING A BINOMIAL OPTION-PRICING MODEL.

THE SHAREVALUE TRUST IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CONTRA-EQUITY ACCOUNT AND STATED AT MARKET VALUE. MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ARE OFFSET TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THERE WAS $36 OF TOTAL

UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO THE SHAREVALUE TRUST WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED DURING THE SIX MONTHS ENDING JUNE 30, 2010.

THE

TRUST WAS SPLIT BETWEEN TWO FUNDS, FUND 1 AND FUND 2, UPON ITS INITIAL FUNDING. BASED ON THE AVERAGE STOCK PRICE OF $66.15 AS OF JUNE 30, 2008, THE MARKET VALUE OF FUND 2 EXCEEDED THE THRESHOLD OF $1,028 BY $236. THIS

EXCESS WAS PAID IN BOEING COMMON STOCK, EXCEPT FOR PARTIAL SHARES AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES AND BENEFICIARIES OF DECEASED PARTICIPANTS, WHICH WAS PAID IN CASH.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 THE TRUST HELD 29,563,324 SHARES, OF WHICH 13,216,726 SHARES WERE INCLUDED IN FUND 1. IF ON JUNE 30, 2010, THE MARKET VALUE OF FUND 1 EXCEEDS THE APPRECIATION THRESHOLD STOCK PRICE,

THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE THRESHOLD WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO EMPLOYEES IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 THE THRESHOLD PRICE WAS $85.46 PER SHARE. THE TRUST WILL TERMINATE IN 2010, AND ANY UNDISTRIBUTED SHARES WILL BE TRANSFERRED

TO US UPON TERMINATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PERFORMANCE SHARES

PRIOR TO 2006, PERFORMANCE SHARES WERE A SIGNIFICANT COMPONENT OF OUR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE COMPENSATION. PERFORMANCE SHARES ARE STOCK UNITS THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE TO COMMON STOCK, ON A ONE-TO-ONE BASIS, CONTINGENT UPON STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE.

IF, AT ANY TIME UP TO FIVE YEARS AFTER AWARD, THE STOCK PRICE REACHES AND MAINTAINS FOR 20 CONSECUTIVE DAYS A PRICE EQUAL TO STATED PRICE GROWTH TARGETS, A STATED PERCENTAGE (UP TO 125%) OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED ARE VESTED AND CONVERTIBLE

ELECTION.

ADDITIONALLY, CERTAIN PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT HAVE A CASH SETTLEMENT, ARE RE-MEASURED EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE USING A MONTE CARLO MODEL AND

ARE RECALCULATED AS A LIABILITY. LIABILITY AWARDS VESTING AND TRANSFERRED INTO DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLANS TOTALED $0, $0 AND $48 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY.

OTHER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

PERFORMANCE AWARDS

PERFORMANCE AWARDS ARE CASH UNITS THAT PAYOUT BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF LONG-TERM FINANCIAL GOALS AT THE END OF A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. EACH UNIT HAS AN

INITIAL VALUE OF $100 DOLLARS. THE AMOUNT PAYABLE AT THE END OF THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD MAY BE ANYWHERE FROM $0 TO $200 DOLLARS PER UNIT, DEPENDING ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLAN FOR A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. THE COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE HAS THE DISCRETION TO PAY THESE AWARDS IN CASH, STOCK, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH AFTER THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE, BASED ON THE ESTIMATED PERFORMANCE PAYOUT, IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD.

DURING 2009, 2008 AND 2007, WE GRANTED PERFORMANCE AWARDS TO OUR EXECUTIVES WITH THE PAYOUT BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF FINANCIAL GOALS FOR THE

THREE-YEAR PERIODS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2011, 2010 AND 2009, RESPECTIVELY. THE MINIMUM PAYOUT AMOUNT IS $0 AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY OUT FOR THE 2009, 2008 AND 2007 PERFORMANCE AWARDS IS $304, $289 AND $47.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006, WE GRANTED PERFORMANCE AWARDS TO OUR EXECUTIVES WITH THE PAYOUT BASED ON THE

ACHIEVEMENT OF FINANCIAL GOALS FOR THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2008. THE PAYOUT FOR THESE AWARDS OF $137 OCCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2009.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY HAS A DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN WHICH PERMITS EXECUTIVES TO DEFER RECEIPT

OF A PORTION OF THEIR SALARY, BONUS, AND CERTAIN OTHER INCENTIVE AWARDS. PRIOR TO MAY 1, 2006, EMPLOYEES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN COULD CHOOSE TO DEFER IN EITHER AN INTEREST EARNING ACCOUNT OR A BOEING STOCK UNIT

ACCOUNT. EFFECTIVE MAY 1, 2006, PARTICIPANTS CAN DIVERSIFY DEFERRED COMPENSATION AMONG 19 INVESTMENT FUNDS INCLUDING THE INTEREST EARNING ACCOUNT AND THE BOEING STOCK UNIT ACCOUNT.

TOTAL EXPENSE/(INCOME) RELATED TO DEFERRED COMPENSATION WAS $158, ($223), AND $51 IN 2009, 2008, AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, FOR EMPLOYEES WHO ELECTED TO DEFER THEIR COMPENSATION IN STOCK UNITS PRIOR TO

JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY MATCHED 25% OF THE DEFERRAL WITH ADDITIONAL STOCK UNITS. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, ALL MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS ARE SETTLED IN STOCK UPON RETIREMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, THE DEFERRED

COMPENSATION LIABILITY WHICH IS BEING MARKED TO MARKET WAS $1,143 AND $1,074.

NOTE 17  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CASH FLOW HEDGES

OUR CASH FLOW HEDGES INCLUDE CERTAIN INTEREST

RATE SWAPS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS AND COMMODITY PURCHASE CONTRACTS. INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS UNDER WHICH WE AGREE TO PAY FIXED RATES OF INTEREST ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF VARIABLE-RATE

DEBT OBLIGATIONS. WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS TO MANAGE CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFICALLY FORECASTED SALES AND PURCHASES MADE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY DERIVATIVE

CONTRACTS HEDGE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS PRINCIPALLY OCCURRING WITHIN FIVE YEARS IN THE FUTURE, WITH CERTAIN CONTRACTS HEDGING TRANSACTIONS UP TO 2021. WE USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS FIXED-PRICE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, TO HEDGE AGAINST

POTENTIALLY UNFAVORABLE PRICE CHANGES FOR ITEMS USED IN PRODUCTION. THESE INCLUDE COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE ELECTRICITY AT FIXED PRICES THROUGH 2015.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

INTEREST RATE SWAPS UNDER WHICH WE AGREE TO PAY VARIABLE RATES OF INTEREST ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF

FIXED-RATE DEBT. THE NET CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES AND THE HEDGED ITEMS IS REPORTED IN BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION INTEREST EXPENSE. INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS INSIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT RECEIVING HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

WE ALSO HOLD CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, PRIMARILY FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, FOR RISK MANAGEMENT PURPOSES BUT WITHOUT ELECTING ANY FORM OF HEDGE

ACCOUNTING.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, WE RECLASSIFIED A NET LOSS OF $16 (PRE-TAX) FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE LOSS TO EARNINGS. BASED ON OUR PORTFOLIO OF CASH FLOW HEDGES, WE EXPECT TO RECLASSIFY GAINS OF $36 (PRE-TAX) DURING THE NEXT 12 MONTHS.

WE HAVE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WITH CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES. FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF AT LEAST FIVE YEARS, OUR DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES COULD REQUIRE SETTLEMENT IF WE DEFAULT ON OUR 5-YEAR

CREDIT FACILITY, EXPIRING NOVEMBER 2012. FOR COMMODITY CONTRACTS, OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD REQUIRE COLLATERAL POSTED IN AN AMOUNT DETERMINED BY OUR CREDIT RATINGS. THE FAIR VALUE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY CONTRACTS THAT HAVE

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES THAT ARE IN A LIABILITY POSITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2009 IS $88. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, THERE WERE NO AGGREGATE DERIVATIVE POSITIONS REQUIRING THE POSTING OF COLLATERAL.

$6,154 RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS ($462 OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND $5,692 OF CUSTOMER FINANCING) AND $3,119 RELATED TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. OF THE $6,136 IN GROSS CUSTOMER FINANCING, $5,568 RELATED TO CUSTOMERS WE BELIEVE HAVE LESS

THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. AIRTRAN AIRWAYS, AMERICAN AIRLINES, HAWAIIAN AIRLINES AND CONTINENTAL AIRLINES WERE ASSOCIATED WITH 25%, 15%, 7% AND 7%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR FINANCING PORTFOLIO. FINANCING FOR AIRCRAFT IS COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITY IN

THE RELATED ASSET. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, THERE WAS $10,409 OF FINANCING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER INCLUDING OPTIONS AND PROPOSED AS PART OF SALES CAMPAIGNS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 11, OF WHICH $9,266 RELATED TO CUSTOMERS WE BELIEVE

HAVE LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT.

FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT WORK IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN ESTIMATES OF THE COST AND TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE WORK. SIGNIFICANT BDS FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS INCLUDE

AEW&C, INTERNATIONAL KC-767 TANKERS AND COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY SATELLITES. SIGNIFICANT COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE 787 AND 747-8. THE OPERATIONAL AND TECHNICAL COMPLEXITIES OF THESE PROGRAMS CREATE FINANCIAL RISK,

WHICH COULD TRIGGER TERMINATION PROVISIONS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS OR OTHER FINANCIALLY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE. CHANGES TO COST AND REVENUE ESTIMATES COULD ALSO RESULT IN LOWER MARGINS OR A MATERIAL CHARGE IF THE PROGRAM HAS OR IS DETERMINED TO HAVE A

REACH-FORWARD LOSS.

OTHER RISK

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009, APPROXIMATELY 37% OF OUR TOTAL WORKFORCE WAS REPRESENTED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND APPROXIMATELY 3% OF OUR TOTAL WORKFORCE WAS REPRESENTED BY AGREEMENTS EXPIRING DURING 2010.

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE ARE BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RATES FOR LOANS OF

THE SAME RISK AND MATURITIES. THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR VARIABLE RATE NOTES RECEIVABLE THAT REPRICE FREQUENTLY APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUES. THE FAIR VALUES OF FIXED RATE NOTES RECEIVABLE ARE ESTIMATED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS USING

INTEREST RATES CURRENTLY OFFERED ON LOANS WITH SIMILAR TERMS TO BORROWERS OF SIMILAR CREDIT QUALITY. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DEBT IS BASED ON CURRENT MARKET YIELDS FOR OUR DEBT TRADED IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RESIDUAL VALUE

GUARANTEES AND CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS ARE DETERMINED USING A BLACK FUTURES OPTIONS FORMULA AND INCLUDES SUCH ASSUMPTIONS AS THE EXPECTED VALUE OF THE AIRCRAFT ON THE SETTLEMENT DATE, VOLATILITY OF AIRCRAFT PRICES, TIME UNTIL SETTLEMENT

AND THE RISK FREE DISCOUNT RATE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CREDIT GUARANTEES IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS OF THOSE COMMITMENTS, GIVEN THE CREDITORS PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT, AND DISCOUNTED USING THE RISK FREE RATE. WITH REGARD TO

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF FUTURE FINANCING COMMITMENTS BECAUSE THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FUNDING THOSE COMMITMENTS ARE UNCERTAIN.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 20  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS, CONTRACTS AND OTHER MATTERS ARE PENDING AGAINST US. POTENTIALLY MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES ARE

DISCUSSED BELOW.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, FROM WHICH CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT OR

HAVE RESULTED. SUCH PROCEEDINGS INVOLVE, OR COULD INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES, COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION AND/OR FORFEITURES. UNDER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, A COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS OPERATING

DIVISIONS OR SUBDIVISIONS, CAN ALSO BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, OR LOSE ITS EXPORT PRIVILEGES, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS. WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON CURRENT INFORMATION, THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH GOVERNMENT

DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW.

A-12 LITIGATION

IN 1991, THE U.S. NAVY NOTIFIED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION (NOW MERGED INTO THE BOEING COMPANY) AND GENERAL DYNAMICS

CORPORATION (TOGETHER, THE TEAM) THAT IT WAS TERMINATING FOR DEFAULT THE TEAMS CONTRACT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE A-12 AIRCRAFT. THE TEAM HAD FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT AND BOTH CONTRACTORS ARE

JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM THE TERMINATION. THE TEAM FILED A LEGAL ACTION TO CONTEST THE NAVYS DEFAULT TERMINATION, TO ASSERT ITS RIGHTS TO CONVERT THE TERMINATION TO ONE FOR THE CONVENIENCE

OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND TO OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COSTS INCURRED ON THE A-12 CONTRACT BUT NOT PAID TO DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, INVENTORIES INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $585 OF RECORDED COSTS ON THE A-12 CONTRACT, AGAINST WHICH WE

HAVE ESTABLISHED A LOSS PROVISION OF $350. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVISION, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1990, WAS BASED ON MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATIONS BELIEF, SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WOULD BE

CONVERTED TO A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, AND THAT THE BEST ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE LOSS ON TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE WAS $350.

ON AUGUST 31,

2001, THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ISSUED A DECISION AFTER TRIAL UPHOLDING THE GOVERNMENTS DEFAULT TERMINATION OF THE A-12 CONTRACT. IN 2003, THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT, FINDING THAT THE TRIAL COURT HAD APPLIED THE WRONG

LEGAL STANDARD, VACATED THE TRIAL COURTS 2001 DECISION AND ORDERED THE CASE SENT BACK TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. ON MAY 3, 2007, THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ISSUED A DECISION UPHOLDING THE GOVERNMENTS DEFAULT

TERMINATION OF THE A-12 CONTRACT. WE FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL ON MAY 4, 2007 WITH THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT. ON JUNE 2, 2009, THE COURT OF APPEALS RENDERED AN OPINION AFFIRMING THE TRIAL COURTS 2007 DECISION

SUSTAINING THE GOVERNMENTS DEFAULT TERMINATION. ON AUGUST 14, 2009, WE FILED A COMBINED PETITION FOR PANEL REHEARING AND FOR REHEARING EN BANC IN THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT. ON NOVEMBER 24, 2009, THE COURT DENIED

OUR COMBINED PETITION. WE BELIEVE THAT THE RULING OF THE COURT OF APPEALS UPHOLDING THE DEFAULT TERMINATION IS ERRONEOUS AND IN CONFLICT WITH THE GOVERNING LAW, AND WE INTEND TO FILE A PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI TO THE UNITED STATES SUPREME

COURT ON OR BEFORE MARCH 24, 2010. ON DECEMBER 29, 2009, THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY SENT LETTERS TO THE TEAM REQUESTING PAYMENT OF $1,352 IN UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS, PLUS APPLICABLE INTEREST. WE BELIEVE THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS

NOT ENTITLED TO REPAYMENT OF ANY PROGRESS PAYMENTS AT THIS TIME AND HAVE ADVISED THE DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY OF OUR POSITION.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE

TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT IS CONTRARY TO LAW AND FACT AND THAT THE LOSS PROVISION ESTABLISHED BY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION IN 1990, WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION FROM OUTSIDE COUNSEL, CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE

REDUCTION IN VALUE OF A-12 NET CONTRACTS IN PROCESS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009. FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE A-12 LITIGATION WILL DEPEND ON THE OUTCOME OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS OR POSSIBLE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. WE EXPECT THE UNITED

STATES SUPREME COURT TO DECIDE WHETHER OR NOT TO REVIEW THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION IN

104

TABLE OF CONTENTS

2010, AND IF IT DECIDES TO REVIEW THE CASE, TO ISSUE A DECISION IN 2010 OR 2011. IF THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT DECLINES REVIEW OF THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION, OR IF IT REVIEWS THE

DECISION AND DETERMINES, CONTRARY TO OUR BELIEF, THAT A TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WAS APPROPRIATE, WE COULD INCUR AN ADDITIONAL LOSS OF UP TO $275, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF $235 OF REMAINING INVENTORY COSTS. IF THE COURTS FURTHER HOLD THAT A MONEY

JUDGMENT SHOULD BE ENTERED AGAINST THE TEAM, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT UP TO ONE-HALF OF THE UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS OF $1,350 PLUS STATUTORY INTEREST FROM FEBRUARY 1991 (CURRENTLY TOTALING UP TO $1,485). IN THAT EVENT,

OUR LOSS WOULD TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $1,690 IN PRE-TAX CHARGES. SHOULD, HOWEVER, THE MARCH 31, 1998 JUDGMENT OF THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS IN FAVOR OF THE TEAM BE REINSTATED, WE COULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PAYMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $1,144,

INCLUDING INTEREST FROM JUNE 26, 1991.

EMPLOYMENT AND BENEFITS LITIGATION

ON MARCH 2, 2006, WE WERE SERVED WITH A COMPLAINT FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS, ALLEGING THAT HIRING DECISIONS MADE BY SPIRIT AEROSYSTEMS, INC. (SPIRIT) NEAR THE TIME OF OUR SALE

OF THE WICHITA FACILITY WERE TAINTED BY AGE DISCRIMINATION, VIOLATED EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA), VIOLATED OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, AND CONSTITUTED RETALIATION. THE CASE IS BROUGHT AS A CLASS ACTION ON BEHALF OF

INDIVIDUALS NOT HIRED BY SPIRIT. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT SPIRIT HAS AN OBLIGATION TO INDEMNIFY BOEING FOR CLAIMS RELATING TO THE 2005 SALES TRANSACTION, SPIRIT HAS REFUSED TO INDEMNIFY BOEING FOR ALL CLAIMS ARISING FROM EMPLOYMENT ACTIVITY PRIOR TO

JANUARY 1, 2005. ON JUNE 4, 2008, CLAIMS BY INDIVIDUALS WHO FILED CONSENTS TO JOIN THE AGE DISCRIMINATION EMPLOYMENT ACT COLLECTIVE ACTION AND WERE TERMINATED BY BOEING PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2005 WERE DISMISSED BY STIPULATED ORDER.

ON JUNE 15, 2009, PLAINTIFFS FILED A MOTION SEEKING CLASS CERTIFICATION FOR CERTAIN FORMER BOEING EMPLOYEES AT THE WICHITA, TULSA AND MCALESTER FACILITIES OVER THE AGE OF 40 WHO WERE LAID OFF BETWEEN JANUARY 1, 2005 AND JULY 1, 2005,

AND WERE NOT HIRED BY SPIRIT ON JUNE 17, 2005. ON JULY 31, 2009, BOEING FILED MOTIONS OPPOSING CLASS CERTIFICATION AND SEEKING DISMISSAL OF THE ERISA AND BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIMS. ON AUGUST 14, 2009, BOEING FILED A MOTION SEEKING

DISMISSAL, OR IN THE ALTERNATIVE, DECERTIFICATION OF THE AGE CLAIMS. PLAINTIFFS REPLY BRIEF ON CERTIFICATION OF ERISA §510 AND LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS ACT (LMRA) §301 CLASSES WAS FILED ON AUGUST 28, 2009. PLAINTIFFS

RESPONSE TO DEFENDANTS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON PLAINTIFFS ERISA §510 AND LMRA §301 CLAIMS WAS FILED ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2009. THESE MOTIONS ARE FULLY BRIEFED AND ARE PENDING BEFORE THE COURT.

A SECOND ALLEGED CLASS ACTION INVOLVING OUR SALE OF THE WICHITA FACILITY TO SPIRIT WAS FILED ON FEBRUARY 21, 2007, IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF

KANSAS. THE CASE IS ALSO BROUGHT UNDER ERISA, AND, IN GENERAL, CLAIMS THAT WE HAVE NOT PROPERLY PROVIDED BENEFITS TO CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF FORMER EMPLOYEES AFFECTED BY THE SALE.

ON MAY 22, 2008, PLAINTIFFS FILED A THIRD AMENDED COMPLAINT

AND ON JUNE 3, 2008, FILED A MOTION TO CERTIFY A CLASS. ON JULY 14, 2008, THE COURT GRANTED CLASS CERTIFICATION FOR THE PURPOSE OF ADJUDICATING LIABILITY FOR THE CLASS OF EMPLOYEES WHO WENT TO WORK FOR SPIRIT, AND DEFERRED CLASS

CERTIFICATION MOTIONS FOR THE CLASS OF EMPLOYEES WHO DID NOT GO TO WORK FOR SPIRIT. A MEMORANDUM AND ORDER ON NOVEMBER 3, 2009 RESOLVES DISCOVERY DISPUTES AND DISCOVERY CONTINUES FOR BOTH GROUPS OF EMPLOYEES.

ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2006, TWO UAW LOCAL 1069 RETIREES FILED A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF

TENNESSEE ALLEGING THAT RECENTLY ANNOUNCED CHANGES TO MEDICAL PLANS FOR RETIREES OF UAW LOCAL 1069 CONSTITUTED A BREACH OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS UNDER §301 OF THE LMRA AND §502(A)(1)(B) OF ERISA. ON SEPTEMBER 15,

2006, WE FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS AGAINST THE INTERNATIONAL UAW AND TWO RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN PARTICIPANTS SEEKING A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT CONFIRMING THAT WE HAVE THE LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE CHANGES

TO THESE MEDICAL BENEFITS. ON JUNE 4, 2007, THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE ORDERED THAT ITS CASE BE TRANSFERRED TO THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS. THE TWO CASES WERE CONSOLIDATED ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2007. ON JANUARY 17, 2008, THE

COURT GRANTED THE UAWS MOTION TO AMEND THE COMPLAINT TO DROP THE RETIREES CLAIM FOR VESTED LIFETIME BENEFITS BASED ON SUCCESSIVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND

105

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INSTEAD ALLEGE THAT THE CURRENT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IS THE SOLE ALLEGED SOURCE OF RIGHTS TO RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFITS. BOTH PARTIES FILED MOTIONS FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION ON

NOVEMBER 16, 2007 AND FILED BRIEFS ON CLASS CERTIFICATION ON FEBRUARY 28, 2008. THE PARTIES FILED CROSS-MOTIONS FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON MAY 27, 2008. ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2008, THE COURT CERTIFIED A CLASS OF RETIREES FOR ALL CLAIMS.

ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2009, THE COURT GRANTED BOEINGS MOTION AND RULED THAT THE RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFITS WERE NOT VESTED LIFETIME BENEFITS AND THAT THE 2006 CHANGES TO BENEFITS DID NOT VIOLATE THE 2005 COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT. ON

OCTOBER 8, 2009, THE PLAINTIFFS FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL TO THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS.

ON OCTOBER 13, 2006, WE WERE NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN A LAWSUIT FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS. PLAINTIFFS, SEEKING TO REPRESENT A CLASS OF SIMILARLY SITUATED PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES IN THE BOEING COMPANY VOLUNTARY INVESTMENT PLAN (THE VIP

PLAN), ALLEGED THAT FEES AND EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE VIP PLAN WERE AND ARE UNREASONABLE AND EXCESSIVE, NOT INCURRED SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE VIP PLAN AND ITS PARTICIPANTS, AND WERE UNDISCLOSED TO PARTICIPANTS. THE PLAINTIFFS FURTHER ALLEGED

THAT DEFENDANTS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES IN VIOLATION OF §502(A)(2) OF ERISA, AND SOUGHT INJUNCTIVE AND EQUITABLE RELIEF PURSUANT TO §502(A)(3) OF ERISA. PLAINTIFFS FILED A MOTION TO CERTIFY THE CLASS, WHICH WE OPPOSED. ON

DECEMBER 14, 2007, THE COURT GRANTED PLAINTIFFS LEAVE TO FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT, WHICH COMPLAINT ADDED OUR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS INVESTMENT COMMITTEE AS A DEFENDANT AND INCLUDED NEW ALLEGATIONS REGARDING ALLEGED BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY. THE

STAY OF PROCEEDINGS ENTERED BY THE COURT ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2007, PENDING RESOLUTION BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT OF

LIVELY V. DYNEGY, INC.

, WAS LIFTED ON APRIL 3, 2008, AFTER NOTIFICATION THAT THE

LIVELY

CASE HAD SETTLED. ON APRIL 16, 2008, PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT LEAVE TO FILE A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT, WHICH WE OPPOSED, WHICH WOULD ADD INVESTMENT PERFORMANCE ALLEGATIONS. ON AUGUST 22, 2008, THE COURT GRANTED PLAINTIFFS LEAVE TO

FILE THEIR SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT. ON SEPTEMBER 29, 2008, THE COURT GRANTED PLAINTIFFS MOTION TO CERTIFY THE CLASS OF CURRENT, PAST AND FUTURE PARTICIPANTS OR BENEFICIARIES IN THE VIP PLAN. ON SEPTEMBER 9, 2008, WE FILED A MOTION

FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT TO DISMISS CLAIMS ARISING PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 27, 2000 BASED ON THE ERISA STATUTE OF LIMITATIONS. ON OCTOBER 14, 2008, WE FILED A PETITION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL THE CLASS CERTIFICATION ORDER TO THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT

OF APPEALS. ON JANUARY 15, 2009, WE FILED A MOTION SEEKING DISMISSAL OF ALL CLAIMS AS A MATTER OF LAW. ON AUGUST 10, 2009, THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS GRANTED BOEINGS MOTION FOR LEAVE TO APPEAL THE CLASS CERTIFICATION ORDER.

THE DISTRICT COURT ENTERED A STAY OF PROCEEDINGS IN THE TRIAL COURT PENDING RESOLUTION OF THE CLASS CERTIFICATION APPEAL. ON DECEMBER 29, 2009, THE DISTRICT COURT LIFTED ON PLAINTIFFS MOTION THE STAY OF PROCEEDINGS PREVIOUSLY ENTERED.

BOEING RESPONDED BY FILING AN APPLICATION FOR STAY PENDING APPEAL WITH THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS ON JANUARY 7, 2010.

BSSI/ICO

LITIGATION

ON AUGUST 16, 2004, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. (BSSI) FILED A COMPLAINT FOR

DECLARATORY RELIEF AGAINST ICO GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS (OPERATIONS), LTD. (ICO) IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT ICOS PRIOR TERMINATION OF TWO CONTRACTS FOR CONVENIENCE EXTINGUISHED ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN THE

PARTIES. ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2004, ICO FILED A CROSS

-

COMPLAINT ALLEGING BREACH OF CONTRACT, ECONOMIC DURESS, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, AND OTHER CLAIMS. ICO ADDED THE BOEING COMPANY AS A DEFENDANT IN OCTOBER 2005 TO SOME OF THESE CLAIMS

AND ALSO SUED IT FOR INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT AND MISAPPROPRIATION OF TRADE SECRETS. ON JANUARY 13, 2006, BSSI FILED A CROSS-COMPLAINT AGAINST ICO, ICO GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS (HOLDINGS) LIMITED (ICO HOLDINGS), ICOS PARENT, AND EAGLE

RIVER INVESTMENTS, LLC, PARENT OF BOTH ICO AND ICO HOLDINGS, ALLEGING FRAUD AND OTHER CLAIMS. THE TRIAL COMMENCED ON JUNE 19, 2008, WITH ICO SEEKING TO RECOVER APPROXIMATELY $2,000 IN DAMAGES, INCLUDING ALL MONIES PAID TO BSSI AND BOEING LAUNCH

SERVICES, PLUS PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND OTHER UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND RELIEF.

106

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON OCTOBER 21, 2008, THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT AWARDING ICO COMPENSATORY DAMAGES OF $371 PLUS INTEREST, BASED

UPON FINDINGS OF CONTRACT BREACH, FRAUD AND INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT. ON OCTOBER 31, 2008, THE JURY AWARDED ICO PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $236. ON JANUARY 2, 2009, THE COURT ENTERED JUDGMENT FOR ICO IN THE AMOUNT OF $631 WHICH INCLUDED $24 IN

PREJUDGMENT INTEREST.

ON FEBRUARY 26, 2009 THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART POST-TRIAL MOTIONS WE FILED SEEKING TO SET ASIDE THE

VERDICT. AS A RESULT, ON MARCH 3, 2009, THE COURT ENTERED AN AMENDED JUDGMENT FOR ICO IN THE AMOUNT OF $604, WHICH INCLUDED $371 IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES, $207 IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND $26 IN PREJUDGMENT INTEREST. POST-JUDGMENT INTEREST WILL

ACCRUE ON THE JUDGMENT AT THE RATE OF 10% PER YEAR (SIMPLE INTEREST) FROM JANUARY 2, 2009. WE FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL AND ICO FILED A NOTICE OF CROSS-APPEAL IN MARCH 2009. OUR OPENING BRIEF FOR THE APPEAL WAS FILED ON OCTOBER 27,

2009. NO DATE HAS BEEN SET FOR ARGUMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS ON APPEAL, WHICH WE INTEND TO PURSUE VIGOROUSLY.

BSSI/TELESAT

CANADA

ON NOVEMBER 9, 2006, TELESAT CANADA (TELESAT) AND A GROUP OF ITS INSURERS SERVED BSSI WITH AN ARBITRATION DEMAND ALLEGING BREACH OF

CONTRACT, GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND WILLFUL MISCONDUCT IN CONNECTION WITH THE CONSTRUCTIVE TOTAL LOSS OF ANIK F1, A MODEL 702 SATELLITE MANUFACTURED BY BSSI. TELESAT AND ITS INSURERS INITIALLY SOUGHT OVER $385 IN DAMAGES AND $10 IN LOST PROFITS, BUT

RECENTLY REVISED THEIR DEMAND TO $263. BSSI HAS ASSERTED A COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST TELESAT FOR $6 IN UNPAID PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS AND ALSO A $180 CONTINGENT COUNTERCLAIM ON THE THEORY THAT ANY ULTIMATE AWARD TO REIMBURSE THE INSURERS FOR THEIR

PAYMENTS TO TELESAT COULD ONLY RESULT FROM TELESATS BREACH OF ITS CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO OBTAIN A FULL WAIVER OF SUBROGATION RIGHTS BARRING RECOURSE AGAINST BSSI. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CLAIMS ASSERTED BY TELESAT AND ITS INSURERS LACK MERIT,

BUT WE HAVE NOTIFIED OUR INSURANCE CARRIERS OF THE DEMAND. THE ARBITRATION HAS BEEN STAYED PENDING AN APPLICATION BY TELESAT TO THE ONTARIO SUPERIOR COURT ON A PRELIMINARY ISSUE. THE ARBITRATION HEARING DATE HAS BEEN VACATED.

ON APRIL 26, 2007, A GROUP OF OUR INSURERS FILED A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY ASSERTING CERTAIN DEFENSES TO COVERAGE AND

REQUESTING A DECLARATION OF THEIR OBLIGATION UNDER OUR INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE POLICIES RELATING TO THE TELESAT ANIK F1 ARBITRATION. ON JUNE 12, 2008, THE COURT GRANTED THE INSURERS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, CONCLUDING THAT OUR

INSURANCE POLICY EXCLUDED THE KINDS OF LOSSES ALLEGED BY TELESAT. ON JANUARY 16, 2009, THE COURT GRANTED BOEINGS MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION, RULING IN FAVOR OF BOEING TO REQUIRE THE INSURERS TO PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO DEFEND THE

CLAIM.

CIVIL SECURITIES LITIGATION

PLAINTIFF

SHAREHOLDERS HAVE FILED A PUTATIVE SECURITIES FRAUD CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE BOEING COMPANY AND TWO OF OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES. THIS LAWSUIT ARISES FROM OUR JUNE 2009 ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE FIRST FLIGHT OF THE 787 DREAMLINER WOULD BE POSTPONED DUE TO A

NEED TO REINFORCE AN AREA WITHIN THE SIDE-OF-BODY SECTION OF THE AIRCRAFT. PLAINTIFFS CONTEND THAT WE WERE AWARE BEFORE JUNE 2009 THAT THE FIRST FLIGHT COULD NOT TAKE PLACE AS SCHEDULED DUE TO ISSUES WITH THE SIDE-OF-BODY SECTION OF THE AIRCRAFT,

AND THAT OUR DETERMINATION NOT TO ANNOUNCE THIS DELAY EARLIER RESULTED IN AN ARTIFICIAL INFLATION OF OUR STOCK PRICE FOR A MULTI-WEEK PERIOD IN MAY AND JUNE 2009. PLAINTIFFS COMPLAINT WAS FILED IN NOVEMBER 2009. NO BRIEFING OR DISCOVERY HAS

YET TAKEN PLACE. WE BELIEVE THE ALLEGATIONS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND INTEND TO CONTEST THE CASE VIGOROUSLY.

IN ADDITION, PLAINTIFF SHAREHOLDERS HAVE FILED

THREE SIMILAR SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS CONCERNING THE FLIGHT SCHEDULE FOR THE 787 DREAMLINER THAT CLOSELY TRACKS THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. NO BRIEFING OR DISCOVERY HAS YET TAKEN PLACE. WE BELIEVE THE ALLEGATIONS

ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND INTEND TO CONTEST THE CASE VIGOROUSLY.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE BOEING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS

FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX AT ITEM 15(A) 2. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE ARE THE

RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE

ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, SUCH CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE BOEING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2009 AND 2008, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2009, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF THE BOEING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED

BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN

ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE

POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2009, BASED ON THE

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN
