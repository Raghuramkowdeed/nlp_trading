PART I

ITEM 1.     BUSINESS

THE BOEING COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES (HEREIN REFERRED TO AS

THE "COMPANY"), IS ONE OF THE WORLD'S MAJOR AEROSPACE FIRMS. THE COMPANY IS

ORGANIZED BASED ON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IT OFFERS. THE COMPANY OPERATES

IN THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPAL AREAS: COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES, MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND

MISSILE SYSTEMS, SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS AND CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING.

THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT IS INVOLVED IN DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND

MARKETING OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT AND PROVIDING RELATED SUPPORT SERVICES,

PRINCIPALLY TO THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE.

THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT IS INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH,

DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, MODIFICATION AND SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS AND

RELATED SYSTEMS: MILITARY AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING FIGHTER, TRANSPORT AND ATTACK

AIRCRAFT; HELICOPTERS; AND MISSILES.

THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT IS INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT,

PRODUCTION, MODIFICATION AND SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS AND RELATED

SYSTEMS: SPACE SYSTEMS; MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS; SATELLITES AND SATELLITE

LAUNCHING VEHICLES; ROCKET ENGINES; AND INFORMATION AND BATTLE MANAGEMENT

SYSTEMS.

THE CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING SEGMENT IS PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE

FINANCING OF COMMERCIAL AND PRIVATE AIRCRAFT AND COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT.

IN 2001, THE COMPANY ADJUSTED THE SEGMENT CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED AN "OTHER" SEGMENT CLASSIFICATION WHICH

PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES THE ACTIVITIES OF CONNEXION BY BOEINGSM, A TWO-WAY DATA

COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE FOR GLOBAL TRAVELERS; AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT, A

BUSINESS UNIT DEVELOPING NEW APPROACHES TO A GLOBAL SOLUTION TO ADDRESS AIR

TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT ISSUES; AND PHANTOM WORKS, AN ADVANCED RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, IMPROVED

PROCESSES AND THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS.

REVENUES, EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA OF THE COMPANY'S

BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, ARE SET FORTH

ON PAGES 79-83 OF THE COMPANY'S 2001 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND ARE

INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

ON JULY 26, 2001, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED SBS INTERNATIONAL, A DEVELOPER OF

AIRLINE FLIGHT OPERATIONS SOFTWARE, FOR $22 MILLION.

ON OCTOBER 6, 2000, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED HUGHES SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

BUSINESSES AND RELATED OPERATIONS. THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES ARE OPERATED UNDER

THE NAME OF BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS (BSS). BSS PROVIDES SPACE-BASED

COMMUNICATIONS, RECONNAISSANCE, SURVEILLANCE AND IMAGING SYSTEMS. BSS ALSO

MANUFACTURES COMMERCIAL COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE

ACQUISITIONS ARE HUGHES ELECTRON DYNAMICS, A SUPPLIER OF ELECTRONIC

COMPONENTS FOR SATELLITES; SPECTROLAB, A PROVIDER OF SOLAR CELLS AND

PANELS FOR SATELLITES; AND A SHARE OF HRL LABORATORIES, A RESEARCH CENTER.

ON OCTOBER 4, 2000, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED JEPPESEN SANDERSON, INC., A PROVIDER

OF FLIGHT INFORMATION SERVICES. JEPPESEN SANDERSON, INC. PROVIDES A FULL

RANGE OF PRINT AND ELECTRONIC FLIGHT INFORMATION SERVICES, INCLUDING NAVIGATION

DATA, COMPUTERIZED FLIGHT PLANNING, AVIATION SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, AVIATION

WEATHER SERVICES, MAINTENANCE INFORMATION, AND PILOT TRAINING SYSTEMS AND

SUPPLIES.                             2

3

ON AUGUST 2, 2000, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED AUTOMETRIC, INC., A GEOSPATIAL

INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY COMPANY, AND ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2000, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED

CONTINENTAL GRAPHICS CORP., A PROVIDER OF TECHNICAL INFORMATION TO THE AVIATION

INDUSTRY. OTHER ACQUISITIONS IN 2000 INCLUDE AEROINFO SYSTEMS, INC.; A PROVIDER

OF ADVANCED MAINTENANCE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY;

SVS, INC., WHICH SPECIALIZES IN ELECTRO-OPTICAL SYSTEMS; AND HAWKER DE

HAVILLAND, WHICH SPECIALIZES IN AIRCRAFT PARTS FABRICATION.

BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS, AUTOMETRIC, INC AND SVS INC., ARE ACCOUNTED FOR

AS PART OF THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT. JEPPESEN SANDERSON, INC.,

CONTINENTAL GRAPHICS CORP., AEROINFO SYSTEMS, INC., HAWKER DE HAVILLAND AND

SBS INTERNATIONAL ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS PART OF THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

SEGMENT.

WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT, THE COMPANY IS A LEADING

PRODUCER OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND OFFERS A FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL JETLINERS

DESIGNED TO MEET A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PASSENGER AND CARGO REQUIREMENTS OF

DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN AIRLINES. THIS FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT

CURRENTLY INCLUDES THE 717, 737 NEXT-GENERATION, AND 757 STANDARD-BODY

MODELS AND THE 767, 777 AND 747 WIDE-BODY MODELS. FINAL DELIVERIES OF THE

MD-80, MD-90 AND 737 CLASSIC AIRCRAFT OCCURRED IN 2000. FINAL DELIVERY OF

THE MD-11 AIRCRAFT OCCURRED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF  2001.

THE WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT IS PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY

LONG-TERM TRENDS IN AIRLINE PASSENGER TRAFFIC. THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS UNDERLYING

LONG-TERM TRAFFIC GROWTH ARE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH, BOTH IN DEVELOPED AND

EMERGING COUNTRIES, AND POLITICAL STABILITY. DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS FURTHER INFLUENCED BY AIRLINE INDUSTRY PROFITABILITY,

WORLD TRADE POLICIES, GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL

CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED UPON AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, AND PRICE

AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT ARE NORMALLY SOLD ON A FIRM FIXED-PRICE BASIS WITH AN

INDEXED PRICE ESCALATION CLAUSE. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO DELIVER JET AIRCRAFT

ON SCHEDULE IS DEPENDENT UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXECUTION OF

INTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS, AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, PERFORMANCE OF

SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AND REGULATORY CERTIFICATION. THE INTRODUCTION

OF NEW COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND MAJOR DERIVATIVES INVOLVES INCREASED

RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND CERTIFICATION

SCHEDULES.

AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF ECONOMIC EXPANSION, THE MAJOR ECONOMIES OF THE UNITED

STATES AND EUROPE BEGAN TO SLOW IN 2001. THE INDUSTRY DOWNTURN IN THE WAKE OF

THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, WAS IMMEDIATE, SERIOUS AND

WIDESPREAD. AIR TRAVEL TO, FROM AND WITHIN THE UNITED STATES WAS HALTED FOR

A PERIOD OF DAYS. AIRLINES CUTBACK THEIR ROUTES AND FREQUENCIES TO DEAL WITH

THE FALL OFF IN TRAFFIC. THE MAJOR U.S. AIRLINES REPORTED SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL

LOSSES IN THE FOURTH QUARTER AND PROFITS FOR EUROPEAN AND ASIAN AIRLINES

DECLINED. RECENT TRENDS INDICATE THAT, ABSENT AN EVENT SIMILAR TO THAT OCCURRING

ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AIR TRAVEL GROWTH AND AIRLINE REVENUE WILL GRADUALLY

RETURN TO PRE-SEPTEMBER 11 LEVELS. AS THIS HAPPENS, AIRLINES ARE EXPECTED TO

SLOWLY EXPAND THEIR ROUTES AND FREQUENCIES AND RETURN TO PROFITABILITY.

THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT SALES ARE SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITION,

INCLUDING FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT ARE NATIONALLY OWNED OR SUBSIDIZED. TO MEET

COMPETITION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A PROGRAM DIRECTED TOWARD CONTINUALLY

ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE AND CAPABILITY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND HAS A FAMILY OF

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT TO MEET VARIED AND CHANGING AIRLINE REQUIREMENTS.

ADDITIONALLY, EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES NETWORK FOR AIRLINES

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN MAINTAINING HIGH CUSTOMER

SATISFACTION.

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE CURRENT MODELS,

AND ASSESSES THE MARKETPLACE TO ENSURE THAT ITS FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL JET

AIRCRAFT IS WELL POSITIONED TO MEET FUTURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AIRLINE

INDUSTRY. THE FUNDAMENTAL STRATEGY IS TO MAINTAIN A BROAD PRODUCT LINE

RESPONSIVE TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS BY MAXIMIZING COMMONALITY AMONG

THE BOEING FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS

DETERMINED TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BY

OFFERING PRODUCTS WITH THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF QUALITY, SAFETY, TECHNICAL

EXCELLENCE, ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND IN-SERVICE SUPPORT.

THE MAJOR FOCUS OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES OVER THE

PAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN THE 767-400ER, THE NEXT-GENERATION 737 FAMILY OF

SHORT-TO-MEDIUM JETLINERS (737-600/700/800/900 MODELS), THE 717 PROGRAM,

THE 747-400ER, 777-300ER, 777-200LR AND A SONIC CRUISER AIRPLANE. INITIAL

DELIVERY OF THE 767-400ER, A STRETCHED VERSION OF THE 767-300ER CAPABLE OF

CARRYING OVER 300 PASSENGERS IN A TWO-CLASS CONFIGURATION, OCCURRED IN THE

THIRD QUARTER OF 2000. THE INITIAL DELIVERY OF THE 737-900, THE LARGEST

MEMBER OF THE NEXT-GENERATION 737 FAMILY OCCURRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER

OF 2001. FIRST DELIVERY OF THE 717 OCCURRED IN SEPTEMBER 1999.

CERTIFICATION AND FIRST DELIVERY OF THE 747-400ER IS SCHEDULED FOR LATE

2002. CERTIFICATION AND FIRST DELIVERY OF THE 777-300ER AND 777-200LR IS

SCHEDULED FOR 2004 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY

THE COMPANY IS OFFERING A NEW VERSION OF THE 747-400 WHICH REDUCES

COMMUNITY NOISE, IMPROVES PASSENGER COMFORT WITH 777 STYLE INTERIOR AND

INCREASES THE RANGE FOR NON-STOP TRANS-PACIFIC OPERATION.  ENTRY INTO

SERVICE IS PLANNED FOR 2004.

THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OF THE DEFENSE AND SPACE UNITS OF ROCKWELL IN

1996; THE MERGER WITH MCDONNELL DOUGLAS IN 1997; AND OTHER ACQUISITIONS,

SUCH AS THE HUGHES SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES, HAVE CREATED A

LARGE AND DIVERSIFIED GROUP OF PROGRAMS IN INFORMATION, SPACE AND DEFENSE

SYSTEMS. THE MAJOR TRENDS THAT SHAPE THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF THE

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT AND THE SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT BUT RELATIVELY FLAT U.S.

GOVERNMENT DEFENSE AND SPACE BUDGETS; RAPID EXPANSION OF INFORMATION AND

COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, THE NEED FOR LOW COST, ASSURED ACCESS TO SPACE,

AND A CONVERGENCE OF MILITARY, CIVIL AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD)

AND NASA, REMAINS THE PRIMARY CUSTOMER IN THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND

MISSILE SYSTEMS AND SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. FROM AN

INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE, THE 2001 QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW (QDR),

RELEASED ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2001, IDENTIFIES NATIONAL SECURITY GOALS THAT

PROMOTE CONTINUED MODERNIZATION AND TRANSFORMATION OF THE NATION'S

MILITARY. THE POLICY GOALS ARE ASSURING ALLIES AND FRIENDS; DISSUADING

FUTURE MILITARY COMPETITION; DETERRING THREATS TO U.S. INTERESTS; AND

DEFEATING AGGRESSION IF DETERRENCE FAILS. THESE GOALS TRANSLATE INTO

CONTINUING DEMANDS FOR FORWARD PRESENCE, RAPID CONTINGENCY RESPONSE,

HOMELAND SECURITY, PEACEKEEPING, HUMANITARIAN AND DISASTER RELIEF

OPERATIONS THAT ARE DRIVING HIGH USAGE OF PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT THAT

RESULTS IN OPERATING COST AFFORDABILITY ISSUES. CURRENT ACQUISITION

RATES FOR AIRCRAFT, MISSILES AND SHIPS ARE WELL BELOW THE RATES NEEDED

TO RECAPITALIZE AGING EQUIPMENT WHILE THE DOD IS FACED WITH RISING

PERSONNEL, HEALTH CARE AND SUPPORT COSTS.

IN LIGHT OF AN IMMEDIATE AND A DURABLE NEED TO MAINTAIN STRONG U.S.

DEFENSE CAPABILITIES COVERING A VERY BROAD SPECTRUM OF THREATS AND

RESPONSES, NEAR-TERM DOD BUDGETS HAVE INCREASED, AND LONGER-RANGE

FORECASTS EXPECT DOD BUDGETS TO GROW FASTER THAN ANTICIPATED PRIOR

TO SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. HOWEVER, WITH A SOFTENING GLOBAL ECONOMY AND

ANTICIPATED FEDERAL BUDGET TENSIONS, ALLOCATIONS TO DOD PROCUREMENT

ARE UNLIKELY TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE DOD

WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY STRATEGIES EMPHASIZING

UNMANNED AIR COMBAT AND RECONNAISSANCE VEHICLES, PRECISION GUIDED

WEAPONS AND CONTINUED PRIVATIZATION OF LOGISTICS AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES

AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS WHILE MAINTAINING CONTROL

OVER COSTS. THE COMPANY'S CAPABILITIES AND PROGRAMS ARE WELL SUITED TO

PROVIDE THE MILITARY CAPABILITIES ESSENTIAL TO MEET THE CHALLENGES.

THE COMPANY'S MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS AND SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN

NATIONAL PRIORITIES AND U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE AND SPACE BUDGETS.

THE PRINCIPAL CONTRIBUTORS TO 2001 MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE

SYSTEMS SEGMENT REVENUES INCLUDED THE C-17 GLOBEMASTER, F/A-18E/F

SUPER HORNET, AH-64 APACHE, F-22 RAPTOR, V-22 OSPREY, AND CH-47

CHINOOK PROGRAMS, ALONG WITH SEVERAL AEROSPACE SUPPORT PROGRAMS.

THE PRINCIPAL CONTRIBUTORS TO 2001 SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT

REVENUES INCLUDED CLASSIFIED PROJECTS FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, BOEING

SATELLITE SYSTEMS, MISSILE DEFENSE, THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION,

SPACE SHUTTLE FLIGHT OPERATIONS AND MAINE ENGINE, AWACS (AIRBORNE

WARNING AND CONTROL SYSTEM) AND DELTA SPACE LAUNCH SERVICES.

IN RECENT YEARS, A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND

MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT BUSINESS HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS

UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT-TYPE CONTRACTS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE LOWER

PROFIT MARGINS THAN FIXED-PRICE-TYPE CONTRACTS. CURRENT MAJOR

DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE F-22 RAPTOR, V-22 OSPREY TILTROTOR

AIRCRAFT, C-130 AVIONICS MODERNIZATION PROGRAM (AMP), THE RAH-66

COMANCHE HELICOPTER AND THE UNMANNED COMBAT AIR VEHICLE (UCAV). BOTH

THE V-22 AND F-22 PROGRAMS HAVE TRANSITIONED TO LOW-RATE INITIAL

PRODUCTION BUT ALSO CONTINUE DEVELOPMENTAL ACTIVITIES. THE C-47

CHINOOK IS CURRENTLY TRANSITIONING FROM DEVELOPMENT TO PRODUCTION OF

A MAJOR NEW UPGRADE PROGRAM.

5

6

MILESTONES FOR THE YEAR INCLUDE DELIVERIES OF 4 GLOBEMASTER

III C-17S TO THE UNITED KINGDOM ROYAL AIR FORCE, A DECISION BY THE

GOVERNMENT OF JAPAN TO PURCHASE 10 AH-64D HELICOPTERS AND THE REPUBLIC

OF SINGAPORE'S OFFER AND ACCEPTANCE WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FOR 12

ADDITIONAL AH-64D APACHE LONGBOW HELICOPTERS.

CURRENT PRODUCTS IN THE TACTICAL MISSILES SEGMENT INCLUDE THE HARPOON

BLOCK II, SLAM-ER, CALCM AND THE JOINT DIRECT ATTACK MUNITION (JDAM).

FUTURE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE SMALL DIAMETER BOMB AND THE COMPANY IS

AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING OPPORTUNITIES THAT UTILIZE HIGH-SPEED TECHNOLOGY

FOR THE NEXT-GENERATION MISSILE.

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT BUSINESS PERFORMED UNDER

COST-REIMBURSEMENT-TYPE CONTRACTS CURRENTLY INCLUDE THE INTERNATIONAL

SPACE STATION, GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE PROGRAM, SPACE SHUTTLE

FLIGHT OPERATIONS AND SPACE SHUTTLE MAIN ENGINE.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE MARKET ENVIRONMENT IS ONE IN WHICH CONTINUED

INTENSE COMPETITION AMONG DEFENSE CONTRACTORS CAN BE EXPECTED, ESPECIALLY

IN LIGHT OF U.S. GOVERNMENT BUDGET CONSTRAINTS. MANY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS

AFFECT THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LAUNCH SERVICES BUSINESS. THE REDUCED DEMAND

PROJECTIONS THAT INCORPORATE THE RESULTS OF THE SOFTENED NON-GEOSTATIONARY

SATELLITE LAUNCH MARKET AND THE RESULTING FORECAST OF EXCESS CAPACITY IN

LAUNCH VEHICLE SUPPLY WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

ATMOSPHERE IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET WHERE CAPABILITY, SERVICE

AVAILABILITY, RELIABILITY, AND AFFORDABILITY WILL BE CRITICAL SUCCESS

FACTORS. THE DOD MARKET REMAINS STEADY WITH RELIABILITY AND A GUARANTEED

SECOND SOURCE BEING THE CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS. WITH THE DELTA FAMILY

AND SEA LAUNCH COMMERCIAL LAUNCH VEHICLES THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED TO

RESPOND TO THESE CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS. AS THE LAUNCH MARKET CONTINUES

TO EVOLVE, THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT IS PREPARED TO PLAY A MAJOR

ROLE IN NASA-DRIVEN AND INDUSTRY-DRIVEN ADVANCED SPACE TRANSPORTATION

TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS.

THE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS MARKET TARGETS BOTH GOVERNMENT AND

COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS. THE MARKET OFFERS THE LARGEST OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH

FOR THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT. THE GOVERNMENT SEGMENT INCLUDES

AIRBORNE MISSION SYSTEMS, SPACE SYSTEMS, SATELLITE SYSTEMS, AND INTEGRATED

SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS OPPORTUNITIES. THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT INCLUDES SATELLITE

MANUFACTURING, NETWORK OPERATIONS AND APPLICATION SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES.

PRODUCTS SERVING THESE MARKETS REQUIRE STRONG CUSTOMER-FOCUSED SOLUTIONS

AND SEAMLESS INTERFACES WITH MULTIPLE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT ITS EXPERIENCE IN LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION PROJECTS,

ALONG WITH RELATED EXPERTISE IN SATELLITE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND

MANUFACTURING WILL PROVIDE THE LEVERAGE NECESSARY TO EXPAND IN THIS MARKET.

THE ACQUISITION AND MERGER CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG U.S. AEROSPACE COMPANIES

HAVE RESULTED IN THREE PRINCIPAL PRIME CONTRACTORS FOR THE DOD AND NASA,

INCLUDING THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT OF THE EXTENSIVE CONSOLIDATION IN THE

DEFENSE AND SPACE INDUSTRY, THE COMPANY AND ITS MAJOR COMPETITORS ARE ALSO

PARTNERS OR MAJOR SUPPLIERS TO EACH OTHER ON VARIOUS PROGRAMS.

THE COMPANY AND LOCKHEED MARTIN ARE 50-50 PARTNERS IN UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE

(USA), WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL GROUND PROCESSING OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE

FLEET AND FOR SPACE-RELATED OPERATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE.

USA ALSO PERFORMS THE MODIFICATION, TESTING AND CHECKOUT OPERATIONS REQUIRED

TO READY THE SPACE SHUTTLE FOR LAUNCH. THE COMPANY'S PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF

JOINT VENTURE EARNINGS IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME.

THE SEA LAUNCH PROGRAM IN WHICH BOEING IS A 40% PARTNER WITH RSC ENERGIA (25%)

OF RUSSIA, KVAERNER MARITIME (20%) OF NORWAY, AND KB YUZHNOYE/PO YUZHMACH (15%)

OF UKRAINE HAD TWO SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHES IN 2001.  THE VENTURE INCURRED LOSSES IN

2001 DUE TO RELATIVELY LOW VOLUME OF LAUNCHES, REFLECTING THE DEPRESSED

SATELLITE MARKET.

THE COMPANY IS ENTITLED TO 50% OF THE EARNINGS OF FLIGHTSAFETY BOEING TRAINING

INTERNATIONAL (FSBTI), A PARTNERSHIP WITH FLIGHTSAFETY INTERNATIONAL INC.,

WHICH PROVIDES PILOT AND CREW TRAINING.

THE CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING SEGMENT CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE

OPERATIONS OF BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION (BCC), WHICH ACTS AS A CAPTIVE FINANCE

SUBSIDIARY FOR THE COMPANY. BCC PROVIDES MARKET BASED LEASE AND LOAN FINANCING

PRIMARILY TO AIRLINES WHO PURCHASE OR LEASE THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.

BCC COMPETES FOR AIRCRAFT FINANCE BUSINESS WITH OTHER FINANCE COMPANIES,

COMMERCIAL BANKS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

BCC ALSO COMPETES IN THE COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT LEASING MARKET, PRIMARILY IN THE

UNITED STATES, AGAINST A NUMBER OF LARGER AND MANY SMALLER COMPETITORS,

INCLUDING OTHER LEASING COMPANIES AND COMMERCIAL BANKS. THE TYPE OF EQUIPMENT

LEASED INCLUDED CORPORATE AIRCRAFT, MACHINE TOOLS, OCEAN-GOING VESSELS, AND

PRODUCTION FACILITIES. LEASING ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 30% OF DOMESTIC

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO GROW AT AN ANNUAL RATE OF

APPROXIMATELY 8%. NEW BUSINESS VOLUME OF BCC IS FUNDED WITH DEBT OBTAINED IN

THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO WHICH IT HAS ACCESS AS WELL AS CASH FROM OPERATIONS AND

CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ITS PARENT COMPANY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AMOUNTED TO $1.9 BILLION, $2.0 BILLION AND

$1.3 BILLION IN 2001, 2000, AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT EXPENSED IN

2000 INCLUDED $557 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D;).

NOT INCLUDED IN CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG ARE PURCHASE OPTIONS AND ANNOUNCED ORDERS

FOR WHICH DEFINITIVE CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED AND ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS

THAT HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION. ADDITIONALLY, U.S. GOVERNMENT AND

FOREIGN MILITARY FIRM BACKLOG IS LIMITED TO AMOUNTS OBLIGATED TO CONTRACTS.

UNOBLIGATED CONTRACT FUNDING NOT INCLUDED IN BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2001,

AND 2000, TOTALED $27.5 BILLION AND $31.3 BILLION.

IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY'S CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS,

CERTAIN RISK FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. APPROXIMATELY 27% OF THE COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT BACKLOG UNITS ARE SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2004. CHANGES IN THE

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AIRLINES SOMETIMES RESULT

IN CUSTOMER REQUESTS FOR RESCHEDULING OR CANCELLATION OF CONTRACTUAL ORDERS.

CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT OR FOR

CONVENIENCE BY THE GOVERNMENT IF DEEMED IN ITS BEST INTERESTS. CONTRACTS THAT

ARE TERMINATED FOR CONVENIENCE GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR PAYMENTS TO A CONTRACTOR

FOR ITS COSTS AND A PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF PROFIT FOR WORK ACCOMPLISHED

THROUGH THE DATE OF TERMINATION. CONTRACTS THAT ARE TERMINATED FOR DEFAULT

GENERALLY PROVIDE THAT THE GOVERNMENT PAYS ONLY FOR THE WORK IT HAS ACCEPTED,

CAN REQUIRE THE CONTRACTOR TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT

PRICE AND THE COST TO REPROCURE THE CONTRACT ITEMS NET OF THE VALUE OF THE WORK

ACCEPTED FROM THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR, AND CAN HOLD A CONTRACTOR LIABLE FOR

DAMAGES.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY SOURCES, SUCH AS

ELECTRICITY, AT AFFORDABLE PRICES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE

AVAILABILITY OF ESSENTIAL MATERIALS, PARTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES FROM ITS SUPPLIERS

AND SUBCONTRACTORS. THE MOST IMPORTANT RAW MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR THE

COMPANY'S AEROSPACE PRODUCTS ARE ALUMINUM (SHEET, PLATE, FORGINGS AND

EXTRUSIONS), TITANIUM (SHEET, PLATE, FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS) AND COMPOSITES

(INCLUDING CARBON AND BORON). ALTHOUGH ALTERNATIVE SOURCES GENERALLY EXIST FOR

THESE RAW MATERIALS, QUALIFICATION OF THE SOURCES COULD TAKE A YEAR OR MORE.

MANY MAJOR COMPONENTS AND PRODUCT EQUIPMENT ITEMS ARE PROCURED OR

SUBCONTRACTED ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS WITH A NUMBER OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN

COMPANIES. THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY OF ITS LARGE NUMBER OF

SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO MEET PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS, QUALITY

STANDARDS, AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES AT ANTICIPATED COSTS, AND THEIR FAILURE TO

DO SO WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AND CONTRACT PROFITABILITY,

WHILE JEOPARDIZING THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO FULFILL COMMITMENTS TO ITS

CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN EXTENSIVE QUALIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE

SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO CONTROL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH RELIANCE ON

THIRD PARTIES.

WHILE THE COMPANY OWNS NUMEROUS PATENTS AND HAS LICENSES UNDER PATENTS OWNED BY

OTHERS RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS AND THEIR MANUFACTURE, IT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT

ITS BUSINESS WOULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY THE EXPIRATION OF ANY PATENTS OR

TERMINATION OF ANY PATENT LICENSE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS NO TRADEMARKS,

FRANCHISES OR CONCESSIONS THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE TO

THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS DESIGNED

TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO REGULATE THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS INTO THE

ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS POLICIES, PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES ARE

PROPERLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT UNREASONABLE RISK OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE AND THE

CONSEQUENT FINANCIAL LIABILITY TO THE COMPANY. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL

LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRES CONTINUING MANAGEMENT EFFORT AND EXPENDITURES BY

THE COMPANY. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAS NOT HAD IN

THE PAST, AND, THE COMPANY BELIEVES, WILL NOT HAVE IN THE FUTURE, MATERIAL

EFFECTS ON THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION OF THE

COMPANY. (SEE ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION.)

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO BUSINESS AND COST CLASSIFICATION REGULATIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH ITS U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE AND SPACE CONTRACTS. VIOLATIONS CAN

RESULT IN CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING FINES,

COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION, FORFEITURES, AND SUSPENSION OR

DEBARMENT FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES (PRINCIPALLY EXPORT SALES FROM DOMESTIC

OPERATIONS) BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA ARE INCLUDED ON PAGE 80 OF THE COMPANY'S 2001

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

APPROXIMATELY 1% OF TOTAL SALES WERE DERIVED FROM NON-U.S. OPERATIONS OF THE

COMPANY FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001.

APPROXIMATELY 46% OF THE COMPANY'S CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG VALUE AT DECEMBER 31,

2001, WAS WITH NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS. SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE

INFLUENCED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT FOREIGN POLICY, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND

TRADE POLICIES OF GOVERNMENTS WORLDWIDE. RELATIVE PROFITABILITY IS NOT

SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT EXPERIENCED IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET.

APPROXIMATELY 18% OF COMBINED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL

FINANCING CONSISTED OF AMOUNTS DUE FROM CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE AMOUNTS ARE PAYABLE IN U.S. DOLLARS, AND, IN

MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, RELATED RISKS ARE ADEQUATELY COVERED BY ALLOWANCE FOR

LOSSES. THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED MATERIALLY ADVERSE FINANCIAL

CONSEQUENCES AS A RESULT OF SALES AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES.

THE COMPANY INCURRED AND IS EXPECTED TO INCUR EMPLOYMENT REDUCTIONS RESULTING

FROM THE DECREASE IN AIRCRAFT DEMAND, WHICH DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ATTACKS OF

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. THE COMPANY'S WORKFORCE LEVEL AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, WAS

APPROXIMATELY 188,000, INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 2,600 IN CANADA AND 900 IN

AUSTRALIA.

MOST RUNWAYS AND TAXIWAYS USED BY THE COMPANY ARE LOCATED ON AIRPORT PROPERTIES

OWNED BY OTHERS AND ARE USED BY THE COMPANY JOINTLY WITH OTHERS.  THE COMPANY'S

RIGHTS TO USE SUCH FACILITIES ARE PROVIDED FOR UNDER LONG-TERM LEASES WITH

MUNICIPAL, COUNTY OR OTHER GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES.  IN ADDITION, THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT FURNISHES THE COMPANY CERTAIN OFFICE SPACE, INSTALLATIONS AND

EQUIPMENT AT GOVERNMENT BASES FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS CONTRACT

ACTIVITIES.  FACILITIES AT THE MAJOR LOCATIONS SUPPORT ALL PRINCIPAL INDUSTRY

SEGMENTS. WORK RELATED TO A GIVEN PROGRAM MAY BE ASSIGNED TO VARIOUS LOCATIONS,

BASED UPON PERIODIC REVIEW OF SHOP LOADS AND PRODUCTION CAPABILITY.

BECAUSE OF THE ACQUISITION OF THE AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE UNITS OF ROCKWELL, OF

HUGHES SATELLITE, AND OF MCDONNELL DOUGLAS, THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF

RE-EVALUATING FACILITIES TO CONSOLIDATE REDUNDANT ACTIVITIES.  PROPERTIES AND

LAND THAT DO NOT MEET LONG-TERM BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS WILL BE LEASED OUT

OR SOLD.

THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL PROPERTIES ARE WELL MAINTAINED AND IN GOOD OPERATING

CONDITION.  ALL OTHER EXISTING FACILITIES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE COMPANY'S

NEAR-TERM OPERATING REQUIREMENTS.

ITEM 3.     LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS,

CONTRACTS AND OTHER MATTERS ARE PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY. MOST SIGNIFICANT

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO MATTERS COVERED BY INSURANCE. MAJOR

CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF

THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THOSE FOR DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND

REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES. DUE IN PART TO THEIR COMPLEXITY AND

PERVASIVENESS, SUCH REQUIREMENTS HAVE RESULTED IN THE COMPANY BEING INVOLVED

WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS SINCE THE

1980S.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES, BASED ON IN-DEPTH STUDIES, EXPERT ANALYSES AND

LEGAL REVIEWS, ITS CONTINGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS FOR REMEDIATION

OF CONTAMINATED SITES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RANGES AND PROBABILITIES OF

RECOVERIES FROM OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO HAVE AND HAVE NOT AGREED TO A

SETTLEMENT AND OF RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS. THE COMPANY'S POLICY IS

TO IMMEDIATELY ACCRUE AND CHARGE TO CURRENT EXPENSE IDENTIFIED EXPOSURES

RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SITES BASED ON ESTIMATES OF INVESTIGATION,

CLEANUP AND MONITORING COSTS TO BE INCURRED.

THE COSTS INCURRED AND EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH

ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT HAD, AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT

TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION. WITH RESPECT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS,

RELATED CHARGES HAVE AVERAGED LESS THAN 2% OF ANNUAL NET EARNINGS.  SUCH

ACCRUALS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR THE RELATED

CONTINGENT RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS, ARE LESS THAN 2% OF TOTAL

LIABILITIES.

BECAUSE OF THE REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES AND RISK OF UNIDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED

SITES AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

COSTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTIMATED COSTS ACCRUED FOR IDENTIFIED

CONTAMINATED SITES.

11

12

HOWEVER, BASED ON ALL KNOWN FACTS AND EXPERT ANALYSES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT

IS NOT REASONABLY LIKELY THAT IDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES WILL

RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE

COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOW TRENDS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS FROM WHICH CIVIL,

CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT. SUCH PROCEEDINGS COULD

INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES, COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE

DAMAGES, RESTITUTION AND/OR FORFEITURES. UNDER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, A

COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS OPERATING DIVISIONS OR SUBDIVISIONS, CAN ALSO BE

SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, OR LOSE ITS EXPORT PRIVILEGES,

BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES, BASED UPON ALL

AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH GOVERNMENT DISPUTES AND

INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION

OR CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

IN 1991, THE U.S. NAVY NOTIFIED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS (NOW A SUBSIDIARY OF THE

COMPANY) AND GENERAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION (THE "TEAM") THAT IT WAS TERMINATING

FOR DEFAULT THE TEAM'S CONTRACT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE

A-12 AIRCRAFT. THE TEAM FILED A LEGAL ACTION TO CONTEST THE NAVY'S DEFAULT

TERMINATION, TO ASSERT ITS RIGHTS TO CONVERT THE TERMINATION TO ONE FOR "THE

CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT," AND TO OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COSTS

INCURRED ON THE A-12 CONTRACT BUT NOT PAID TO DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001,

INVENTORIES INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $583 MILLION OF RECORDED COSTS ON THE A-12

CONTRACT, AGAINST WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A LOSS PROVISION OF $350

MILLION. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVISION, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1990, WAS BASED

ON MCDONNELL DOUGLAS'S BELIEF, SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT

THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WOULD BE CONVERTED TO A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE,

AND THAT THE UPPER RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS ON TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE WAS

$350 MILLION.

ON AUGUST 31, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ISSUED A DECISION AFTER

TRIAL UPHOLDING THE GOVERNMENT'S DEFAULT TERMINATION OF THE A-12 CONTRACT ON THE

GROUND THAT THE TEAM COULD NOT MEET THE REVISED CONTRACT SCHEDULE UNILATERALLY

IMPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT AFTER THE GOVERNMENT HAD WAIVED THE ORIGINAL SCHEDULE.

THE COURT DID NOT, HOWEVER, ENTER A JUDGMENT FOR THE GOVERNMENT ON ITS CLAIM

THAT THE TEAM BE REQUIRED, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE ALLEGED DEFAULT, TO REPAY

PROGRESS PAYMENTS THAT HAD NOT BEEN FORMALLY LIQUIDATED BY DELIVERIES AT THE

TIME OF TERMINATION. THESE UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS TOTAL $1,350 MILLION.

ON OCTOBER 4, 2001, THE COURT CONFIRMED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ENTERING JUDGMENT

IN FAVOR OF THE GOVERNMENT IN THE AMOUNT OF THESE UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS

PAYMENTS. THIS IS THE LATEST DECISION RELATING TO LONG-RUNNING LITIGATION

RESULTING FROM THE A-12 CONTRACT TERMINATION IN 1991, AND FOLLOWS AN EARLIER

TRIAL COURT DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE CONTRACTORS AND REVERSAL OF THAT INITIAL

DECISION ON APPEAL.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES, SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE TRIAL

COURT'S RULINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE UNILATERAL SCHEDULE

AND THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT ARE CONTRARY TO LAW AND FACT. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THE DECISION RAISES VALID ISSUES FOR APPEAL AND IS PURSUING ITS APPEAL.

IF, CONTRARY TO THE COMPANY'S BELIEF, THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT ON

TERMINATION WERE SUSTAINED ON APPEAL, THE COMPANY WOULD INCUR AN ADDITIONAL

LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $275 MILLION, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF REMAINING

INVENTORY COSTS AND ADJUSTMENTS.

12

13

AND IF, CONTRARY TO THE COMPANY'S BELIEF, THE APPEALS COURT FURTHER HELD THAT

A MONEY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE ENTERED AGAINST THE TEAM IN THE AMOUNT OF THE

UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS, THE TEAM WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE GOVERNMENT

$1,350 MILLION PLUS STATUTORY INTEREST FROM FEBRUARY 1991 (CURRENTLY TOTALING

APPROXIMATELY $970 MILLION). UNDER THIS OUTCOME, THE COMPANY WOULD BE OBLIGATED

TO PAY ONE HALF OF THESE AMOUNTS. THE ADDITIONAL LOSS TO THE COMPANY WOULD TOTAL

APPROXIMATELY $1,430 MILLION IN PRETAX CHARGES, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF THE

REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AND THE REMAINING INVENTORY COSTS AND ADJUSTMENTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE LOSS PROVISION ESTABLISHED BY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS

IN 1990 CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE REDUCTION

IN VALUE OF A-12 NET CONTRACTS IN PROCESS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001. FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THE A-12 LITIGATION WILL DEPEND UPON THE OUTCOME OF FURTHER

PROCEEDINGS OR POSSIBLE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

ON OCTOBER 31, 1997, A FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWSUIT WAS FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY

IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, IN SEATTLE.

THE LAWSUIT NAMES AS DEFENDANTS THE COMPANY AND THREE OF ITS THEN EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS OF A SIMILAR NATURE HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE SAME

COURT. THESE LAWSUITS WERE CONSOLIDATED ON FEBRUARY 24, 1998. THE LAWSUITS

GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS DESIRED TO KEEP THE COMPANY'S SHARE PRICE

AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE MCDONNELL DOUGLAS SHAREHOLDERS

WOULD APPROVE THE MERGER AND, IN THE CASE OF THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS, TO

BENEFIT DIRECTLY FROM THE SALE OF BOEING STOCK DURING THE PERIOD FROM

APRIL 7, 1997 THROUGH OCTOBER 22, 1997. BY ORDER DATED MAY 1, 2000, THE COURT

CERTIFIED TWO SUBCLASSES OF PLAINTIFFS IN THE ACTION: A. ALL PERSONS OR ENTITIES

WHO PURCHASED BOEING STOCK OR CALL OPTIONS OR WHO SOLD PUT OPTIONS DURING THE

PERIOD FROM JULY 21, 1997 THROUGH OCTOBER 22, 1997, AND B. ALL PERSONS OR

ENTITIES WHO PURCHASED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS STOCK ON OR AFTER APRIL 7, 1997, AND

WHO HELD SUCH STOCK UNTIL IT CONVERTED TO BOEING STOCK PURSUANT TO THE MERGER.

THE PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND TREBLE DAMAGES. ON

SEPTEMBER 17, 2001, THE COMPANY REACHED AGREEMENT WITH CLASS COUNSEL TO SETTLE

THE LAWSUIT FOR $92.5 MILLION. THE SETTLEMENT WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE

COMPANY'S EARNINGS, CASH FLOW OR FINANCIAL POSITION, AS IT IS WITHIN INSURANCE

LIMITS. THE SETTLEMENT IS CONDITIONED ON NOTICE TO THE CLASS MEMBERS AND COURT

APPROVAL, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN 2002.

ON FEBRUARY 25, 2000, A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ALLEGING GENDER

DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT WAS FILED AGAINST THE BOEING COMPANY, BOEING

NORTH AMERICAN, INC., AND MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION. THE COMPLAINT, FILED

WITH THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE, ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY HAS

ENGAGED IN A PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT AND

RETALIATION AGAINST FEMALES OVER THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS. THE COMPLAINT, BECK

V. BOEING, NAMES 28 WOMEN WHO HAVE WORKED FOR BOEING IN THE PUGET SOUND AREA;

WICHITA, KANSAS; ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI; AND TULSA, OKLAHOMA. ON MARCH 15, 2000,

AN AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED NAMING AN ADDITIONAL 10 PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING

THE FIRST FROM CALIFORNIA. THE LAWSUIT ATTEMPTS TO REPRESENT ALL WOMEN WHO

CURRENTLY WORK FOR THE COMPANY, OR WHO HAVE WORKED FOR THE COMPANY IN THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS.

THE COMPANY HAS DENIED THE ALLEGATION THAT IT HAS ENGAGED IN ANY UNLAWFUL

"PATTERN AND PRACTICE." PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION WAS FILED

IN MAY 2001. THE CLASS THEY SOUGHT INCLUDED SALARIED EMPLOYEES IN PUGET SOUND,

WICHITA, ST. LOUIS, AND LONG BEACH, AND HOURLY EMPLOYEES IN PUGET SOUND,

WICHITA, AND ST. LOUIS.

13

14

ON OCTOBER 19, 2001, THE COURT GRANTED CLASS CERTIFICATION TO A SEGMENT OF THE

POPULATION SOUGHT BY THE PLAINTIFFS. THE COURT RULED THAT THE ACTION COULD

PROCEED ON THE BASIS OF TWO LIMITED SUBCLASSES: A. ALL NON-EXECUTIVE SALARIED

WOMEN (INCLUDING ENGINEERS) IN THE PUGET SOUND AREA, AND B. ALL HOURLY WOMEN

COVERED BY THE MACHINISTS' BARGAINING AGREEMENT IN THE PUGET SOUND AREA. THE

CLAIMS TO BE LITIGATED ARE ALLEGED GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN COMPENSATION AND

PROMOTION. THE COURT ALSO HELD THAT THE PLAINTIFFS COULD NOT SEEK BACK PAY.

RATHER, SHOULD LIABILITY BE FOUND, THE POTENTIAL REMEDIES INCLUDE SOME FORM OF

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AS WELL AS PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE U.S. NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF

APPEALS HAS ACCEPTED THE COMPANY'S INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL OF THE CLASS

CERTIFICATION DECISION, PARTICULARLY THE RULING THAT LEAVES OPEN THE

POSSIBILITY OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE ITS

AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE OF THESE CASES. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHAT IMPACT,

IF ANY, THESE CASES COULD HAVE ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY HAS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK,

PRINCIPALLY SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, FIXED-RATE NOTES RECEIVABLE ATTRIBUTABLE

TO CUSTOMER FINANCING, AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS ISSUED AT A FIXED RATE.

HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED MATERIAL GAINS OR LOSSES DUE

TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES WHEN SELLING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OR FIXED-RATE

NOTES RECEIVABLE. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO

MANAGE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES. BASED ON THE CURRENT HOLDINGS

OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND FIXED-RATE NOTES, AS WELL AS UNDERLYING

SWAPS, THE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IS NOT MATERIAL. FIXED-RATE

DEBT OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY THE COMPANY ARE GENERALLY NOT CALLABLE UNTIL

MATURITY.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK RELATING TO

RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.

AS A GENERAL POLICY, THE COMPANY SUBSTANTIALLY HEDGES FOREIGN CURRENCY

COMMITMENTS OF FUTURE PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS BY PURCHASING FOREIGN CURRENCY

FORWARD CONTRACTS. LESS THAN TWO PERCENT OF RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE

CONTRACTED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AND THE MARKET RISK EXPOSURE RELATING TO

CURRENCY EXCHANGE IS NOT MATERIAL.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES THE COMPANY BELIEVES ARE

MOST CRITICAL TO HELP PUT IN CONTEXT A DISCUSSION CONCERNING THE RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS.

SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT SALES ARE RECORDED AS DELIVERIES ARE MADE UNLESS TRANSFER

OF RISK AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP IS NOT SUFFICIENT.

SALES UNDER FIXED-PRICE-TYPE CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS DELIVERIES

ARE MADE OR AT THE COMPLETION OF SCHEDULED PERFORMANCE MILESTONES. FOR CERTAIN

FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE OVER AN EXTENDED

PERIOD BEFORE DELIVERIES BEGIN, SALES ARE RECORDED BASED UPON ATTAINMENT OF

EITHER INTERNALLY IDENTIFIED OR EXTERNAL PERFORMANCE MILESTONES. SALES UNDER

COST-REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. CERTAIN

CONTRACTS CONTAIN PROFIT INCENTIVES BASED UPON PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO

PREDETERMINED TARGETS THAT MAY OCCUR DURING OR SUBSEQUENT TO DELIVERY OF THE

PRODUCT. INCENTIVES, OF WHICH AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, ARE

RECORDED OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD OF THE CONTRACT. INCENTIVES AND FEE

AWARDS, OF WHICH AMOUNTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, ARE RECORDED WHEN

AWARDED. CERTAIN CONTRACTS CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR THE REDETERMINATION OF PRICE

BASED UPON FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER FINANCING ACTIVITIES IS INCLUDED IN SALES AND

OTHER OPERATING REVENUES.

CONTRACT AND PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

IN THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT AND SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT, OPERATIONS PRINCIPALLY CONSIST OF PERFORMING WORK UNDER

CONTRACT, PREDOMINANTLY FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. COST

OF SALES FOR SUCH CONTRACTS IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE TOTAL

CONTRACT COST AND REVENUE. ESTIMATES OF EACH CONTRACT'S REVENUE AND COST ARE

REVIEWED AND REASSESSED QUARTERLY. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES RESULT IN CUMULATIVE

REVISIONS TO THE CONTRACT PROFIT RECOGNIZED. COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS ARE

PLANNED, COMMITTED AND FACILITIZED BASED ON LONG-TERM DELIVERY FORECASTS,

NORMALLY FOR QUANTITIES IN EXCESS OF CONTRACTUALLY FIRM ORDERS. COST OF SALES

FOR THE 717, 737, 747, 757, 767 AND 777 COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS IS

DETERMINED UNDER THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING BASED ON ESTIMATED AVERAGE

TOTAL COST AND REVENUE FOR THE CURRENT PROGRAM QUANTITY. THE PROGRAM METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING EFFECTIVELY AVERAGES TOOLING AND SPECIAL EQUIPMENT COSTS, AS WELL

AS UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS, OVER THE PROGRAM QUANTITY. BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT

PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW PROGRAM AND THE

SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT REQUIRED FOR INITIAL TOOLING AND SPECIAL EQUIPMENT, NEW

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS NORMALLY HAVE LOWER OPERATING PROFIT MARGINS

THAN ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS. IN 2001, THE INITIAL PROGRAM QUANTITY FOR THE 717

PROGRAM WAS REVISED FROM 200 TO 135 UNITS. THE ESTIMATED PROGRAM AVERAGE COSTS

AND REVENUES ARE REVIEWED AND REASSESSED QUARTERLY, AND CHANGES IN ESTIMATES

ARE RECOGNIZED OVER CURRENT AND FUTURE DELIVERIES CONSTITUTING THE

PROGRAM QUANTITY.

37

38

TO THE EXTENT THAT INVENTORIABLE COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO EXCEED THE TOTAL

ESTIMATED SALES PRICE, CHARGES ARE MADE TO CURRENT EARNINGS TO REDUCE

INVENTORIED COSTS TO ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE.

SHARE-BASED PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE EXPENSE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 123, "ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION." THE COMPANY VALUES STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED BASED UPON AN

OPTION-PRICING MODEL AND RECOGNIZES THIS VALUE AS AN EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD

IN WHICH THE OPTIONS VEST. POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION FROM THE SHAREVALUE TRUST

HAVE BEEN VALUED BASED UPON AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL, WITH THE RELATED EXPENSE

RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRUST. SHARE-BASED EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH

PERFORMANCE SHARES IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S

STOCK AT THE TIME OF THE AWARD APPLIED TO THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES

CONTINGENTLY ISSUABLE BASED ON STOCK PRICE AND IS AMORTIZED OVER A

FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.

AIRCRAFT VALUATION

AIRCRAFT DEEMED AVAILABLE FOR SALE, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORY,

ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS USED

AIRCRAFT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS RELATIVE TO THE AIRCRAFT'S ANTICIPATED FAIR

VALUE, AND RECORDS ANY DEFICIENCY AS A CHARGE TO EARNINGS. FAIR VALUE IS

DETERMINED BY USING BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AIRCRAFT VALUATIONS, INCLUDING

INFORMATION DEVELOPED FROM THE SALE OF SIMILAR AIRCRAFT IN THE SECONDARY MARKET.

AIRCRAFT ON OPERATING LEASE OR HELD FOR OPERATING LEASE ARE CLASSIFIED WITH

CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING ASSETS. THE COMPANY REVIEWS THESE OPERATING

LEASE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY OR WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE

THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN ASSET IS

CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW, BASED ON MARKET

ASSESSMENT OF LEASE RATES, OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE IS LESS THAN THE NET

BOOK VALUE. WHEN IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF

IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS THE EXCESS OF NET BOOK VALUE OVER FAIR VALUE.

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS UNDER SFAS NO. 112,

"EMPLOYER'S ACCOUNTING FOR POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS." A LIABILITY FOR

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IS RECORDED WHEN TERMINATION IS PROBABLE AND THE AMOUNT

IS ESTIMABLE.

STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

IN JUNE 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED SFAS

NO. 141, "BUSINESS COMBINATIONS," AND SFAS NO. 142, "GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS." THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO ADOPT SFAS NO. 141 FOR ALL

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS COMPLETED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES

THAT BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001, BE ACCOUNTED FOR

UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD. GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT RESULTED

FROM BUSINESS COMBINATIONS BEFORE JULY 1, 2001, MUST BE RECLASSIFIED TO

CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS NO. 142, AS OF THE STATEMENT ADOPTION DATE.

38

39

THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT SFAS NO. 142 AT THE BEGINNING OF 2002 FOR ALL GOODWILL

AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANY'S STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

POSITION AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002. THIS STANDARD CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING FOR

GOODWILL FROM AN AMORTIZATION METHOD TO AN IMPAIRMENT-ONLY APPROACH, AND

INTRODUCES A NEW MODEL FOR DETERMINING IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE NEW IMPAIRMENT MODEL REQUIRES PERFORMANCE OF A TWO-STEP TEST FOR OPERATIONS

THAT HAVE GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO THEM. FIRST, IT REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF THE BOOK

VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS. FAIR VALUES ARE

ESTIMATED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THE

COMPANY'S MARKET CAPITALIZATION AT THE DATE OF EVALUATION. IF FAIR VALUE IS

DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN BOOK VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE

AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT. IN THIS PROCESS, THE FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IS ESTIMATED,

AND IS COMPARED TO ITS BOOK VALUE. ANY SHORTFALL OF THE BOOK VALUE BELOW FAIR

VALUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.

UPON TRANSITION TO THE NEW IMPAIRMENT MODEL AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY

PROJECTS THAT IT WILL RECOGNIZE A REDUCTION OF GOODWILL AND A PRETAX CHARGE IN

THE RANGE OF $2,100 MILLION TO $2,600 MILLION, IDENTIFIED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT

OF AN ACCOUNTING CHANGE. THIS CHARGE RESULTS FROM THE CHANGE FROM THE PRIOR

IMPAIRMENT METHOD, WHOSE FIRST STEP WAS BASED ON UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, TO THE

NEW ONE THAT IS BASED ON FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT WILL REFLECT THE

ESTIMATES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANTS AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2002, THE DATE OF ADOPTION.

IN JUNE 2001, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 143, "ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS," AND IN AUGUST 2001, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 144, "ACCOUNTING FOR

THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS." THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE

THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE STANDARDS WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

---------------------------------------------

REVENUES

OPERATING REVENUES FOR 2001 WERE $58.2 BILLION COMPARED WITH $51.3 BILLION IN

2000 AND $58.0 BILLION IN 1999. THE HIGHER REVENUES IN 2001 PRINCIPALLY REFLECT

INCREASED DELIVERIES IN THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT, BUT ALSO REFLECT AN

INCREASE IN SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT REVENUES OF $2.4 BILLION TO $10.4

BILLION. THE LOWER REVENUES IN 2000 RELATIVE TO 1999 PRINCIPALLY REFLECTED

DECREASED DELIVERIES IN THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

AN INCREASE IN SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT REVENUES OF $1.2 BILLION TO

$8.0 BILLION IN 2000.

CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING

FINANCING OPERATING REVENUES IN THE CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING

SEGMENT, WHICH CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY BOEING

CAPITAL CORPORATION, WERE $863 MILLION IN 2001, COMPARED WITH $728 MILLION

IN 2000 AND $686 MILLION IN 1999. THE MAJOR REVENUE COMPONENTS INCLUDE

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT FINANCING AND COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT LEASING. THE

INCREASE IN 2001 RELATES PRINCIPALLY TO THE HIGHER VOLUME OF COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT FINANCING.

. . . . . .

BASED ON CURRENT SCHEDULES AND PLANS, THE COMPANY PROJECTS TOTAL 2002

REVENUES TO BE APPROXIMATELY $54 BILLION.

EARNINGS

NET EARNINGS OF $2,827 MILLION FOR 2001 WERE $699 MILLION HIGHER THAN

2000 EARNINGS. THE INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS PRINCIPALLY REFLECTED

INCREASED OPERATING EARNINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN REVENUE

FOR 2001. NET EARNINGS IN 2001 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY $935 MILLION

PRETAX SPECIAL CHARGES ($633 MILLION AFTER TAX) RELATED TO THE EVENTS OF

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED IN THE OPERATING EARNINGS SECTION.

THE INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS FOR 2001 OVER 2000 ALSO REFLECTS THE IN-PROCESS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE OF $557 MILLION ($348 MILLION AFTER TAX)

THAT WAS RECOGNIZED IN 2000, OF WHICH $500 MILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

ACQUISITION OF THE HUGHES SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES WHICH WERE

RENAMED BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS.

EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES WERE $3,564 MILLION FOR 2001, COMPARED WITH

$2,999 MILLION IN 2000. IN ADDITION TO THE CHANGE IN OPERATING EARNINGS

DISCUSSED BELOW, OTHER INCOME DECREASED $68 MILLION IN 2001, TO $318 MILLION

IN 2001 FROM $386 MILLION IN 2000. THE DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME IN 2001

PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS LOWER INTEREST INCOME FROM CASH, BUT WAS PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY HIGHER INTEREST INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH FEDERAL INCOME TAX AUDIT

SETTLEMENTS ($210 MILLION IN 2001, COMPARED WITH $73 MILLION IN 2000). OTHER

INCOME IN 2000 ALSO INCLUDED A $42 MILLION GAIN ON SALE OF A LONG-HELD EQUITY

INVESTMENT. INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE INCREASED $205 MILLION IN 2001, TO

$650 MILLION IN 2001 FROM $445 MILLION IN 2000. THE INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE

RESULTED FROM INCREASED DEBT, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASED CUSTOMER

AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION. INTEREST

EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE CONCURRENT WITH INCREASING FUTURE FINANCING

ACTIVITY.

NET EARNINGS OF $2,128 MILLION FOR 2000 WERE $181 MILLION LOWER THAN 1999

EARNINGS. NET EARNINGS FOR 2000 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY $557 MILLION

EXPENSED AS IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. NET EARNINGS ALSO REFLECTED

SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT IN COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT MARGINS RESULTING FROM

CONTINUED PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES. OTHER INCOME DECREASED $199 MILLION IN 2000

TO $386 MILLION. THIS DECREASE PRINCIPALLY REFLECTS LOWER INTEREST INCOME

RESULTING FROM LOWER CASH LEVELS, BUT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE $73 MILLION

OF INTEREST INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENTS AND

THE $42 MILLION GAIN FROM THE SALE OF A LONG-HELD EQUITY INVESTMENT. INTEREST

AND DEBT EXPENSE FOR 2000 AND 1999 WAS RELATIVELY STABLE.

AS INDICATED IN NOTE 20, THE COMPANY HAS GENERATED SIGNIFICANT NET PERIODIC

BENEFIT INCOME RELATED TO PENSIONS: $920 MILLION IN 2001, $428 MILLION IN

2000 AND $125 MILLION IN 1999. NOT ALL NET PERIODIC PENSION BENEFIT INCOME

OR EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS IN THE YEAR INCURRED SINCE THEY ARE

PRINCIPALLY ALLOCATED TO PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT COSTS, AND A PORTION REMAINS

IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, THE OPERATING

EARNINGS FOR 2001 AND 2000 INCLUDED $785 MILLION AND $403 MILLION OF INCOME

DUE TO PENSIONS. THE SIGNIFICANTLY UNFAVORABLE RETURNS EXPERIENCED BY PENSION

ASSETS DURING 2001 ARE THE PRINCIPAL CAUSE OF THE SHIFT IN UNRECOGNIZED NET

ACTUARIAL GAINS AND LOSSES, FROM UNRECOGNIZED ACTUARIAL GAINS OF $10.7 BILLION

AT THE END OF 2000 TO UNRECOGNIZED ACTUARIAL LOSSES OF $2.9 BILLION AT THE END

OF 2001. THE COMPANY PROJECTS THAT NET PERIODIC BENEFIT INCOME RELATED TO

PENSIONS WILL DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY DURING 2002 AND BEYOND AND PROJECTS 2002

NET PERIODIC BENEFIT INCOME WILL BE APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION LESS THAN IN

2001.

OPERATING RESULTS TRENDS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY THE EFFECT

OF CHANGING PRICES SINCE MOST OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IS PERFORMED UNDER

CONTRACT.

OPERATING EARNINGS

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

THE 2001 COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT EARNINGS OF $2,632 MILLION

(BASED ON THE COST OF SPECIFIC AIRPLANE UNITS DELIVERED - SEE DISCUSSION

UNDER SEGMENT INFORMATION ON PAGE 107) INCLUDED $908 MILLION OF NON-RECURRING

CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, TERRORIST ATTACKS. THE SEGMENT

OPERATING MARGIN FOR 2001 INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF NON-RECURRING CHARGES WAS

7.5%. EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2001 EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING CHARGES TOTALED

$3,540 MILLION RESULTING IN AN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS MARGIN OF 10.1%.

THE 2000 COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT EARNINGS OF $2,736 MILLION RESULTED IN

AN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS MARGIN OF 8.8%. THE 1999 COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

SEGMENT EARNINGS OF $2,082 MILLION RESULTED IN AN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS

MARGIN OF 5.4%. THE INCREASED EARNINGS AND MARGINS EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING

CHARGES FOR 2001 WERE PRINCIPALLY DUE TO CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE

PRODUCTION PROCESS.

SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS INCLUDED $68 MILLION FOR 2001 AND $22 MILLION FOR

2000 OF AMORTIZATION EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES.

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT EARNINGS, AS DETERMINED UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP), REFLECT THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND

INCORPORATE A PORTION OF THE 'ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS' CAPTION AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 28. EXCLUDING THE NON-RECURRING CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE

EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT EARNINGS UNDER GAAP,

AND INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, WERE $2,819 MILLION FOR 2001, $2,099

MILLION FOR 2000 AND $1,778 MILLION FOR 1999, AND COMPARABLE MARGINS WERE 8.0%,

6.7% AND 4.6%, RESPECTIVELY.

THE IMPROVING GAAP MARGINS OVER THIS PERIOD REFLECT IMPROVED UNIT COSTS OVER

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, ALONG WITH THE IMPACT OF ADDITIONAL UNITS WITHIN THE

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE NEXT-GENERATION 737 AND THE 777. BECAUSE OF THE

HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW PROGRAM AND

THE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT REQUIRED FOR INITIAL TOOLING AND SPECIAL EQUIPMENT,

NEW COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS NORMALLY HAVE LOWER OPERATING PROFIT

MARGINS THAN ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS. THE INCREASE OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR

A NEW PROGRAM GENERALLY RESULTS IN IMPROVED MARGINS.

43

44

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES (CONTINUED)

THE NEXT-GENERATION 737 PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY WAS 800 UNITS AT THE

BEGINNING OF 1999, 1,200 UNITS AT THE END OF 1999, 1,650 UNITS AT THE END OF

2000 AND 1,800 UNITS AT THE END OF 2001. THE 777 ACCOUNTING QUANTITY WAS 500

AT THE END OF 1999 AND 600 AT THE END OF 2000 AND 2001. IMPROVED MARGINS FROM

1999 THROUGH 2001 ALSO REFLECT AN INCREASE IN ESTIMATED REVENUE FOR AIRPLANES

WITHIN THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITIES.

IN 1999, THE COMPANY DELIVERED THE INITIAL UNITS OF THE 717 PROGRAM, AND 93

UNITS HAVE CUMULATIVELY BEEN DELIVERED AS OF YEAR-END 2001. THE 717 PROGRAM

IS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING DESCRIBED IN THE

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES DISCUSSED ON PAGES 37-38. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED

THE INITIAL PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY AT 200 UNITS. BECAUSE OF A LACK OF

FIRM DEMAND FOR THE 717 AIRCRAFT SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY WAS REDUCED TO 135 AIRCRAFT. THIS CHANGE IN

ESTIMATE CREATED A $250 MILLION PRETAX LOSS AND WAS TREATED AS A SPECIAL

CHARGE DUE TO EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. THE COMPANY WILL RECORD 717

DELIVERIES ON A BREAK-EVEN BASIS UNTIL PROGRAM REVIEWS INDICATE POSITIVE

GROSS PROFIT WITHIN THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. SUCH PROGRAM REVIEWS

COULD INCLUDE REVISED ASSUMPTIONS OF REVENUES AND COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS

POTENTIALLY MATERIAL EXPOSURES RELATED TO THE 717 PROGRAM, PRINCIPALLY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO VENDOR TERMINATION COSTS THAT COULD RESULT FROM A LACK OF

LONGER-TERM MARKET ACCEPTANCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS POTENTIAL

EXPOSURE RELATING TO THE VALUATION OF 717 CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSETS. AS

DISCUSSED IN NOTE 12 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY HAS $1,499 MILLION OF CUSTOMER FINANCING

ASSETS RELATING TO THE 717 PROGRAM, OF WHICH $692 MILLION ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS OPERATING LEASE ASSETS.

THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT IS PROJECTING LOWER DELIVERIES IN THE

NEAR TERM, AND THE RESULTING DOWNSIZING THAT BEGAN IN 2001 AND IS

PROJECTED TO CONTINUE DURING 2002 WILL ADD TO THE COMPLEXITY OF ACHIEVING

ESTIMATED COST TARGETS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THESE COMPLEXITIES HAVE

BEEN ADEQUATELY CONSIDERED IN PROJECTING COST ESTIMATES THAT ARE INHERENT

IN MARGINS DETERMINED UNDER THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING; HOWEVER, SUCH

COST ESTIMATES REMAIN SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL ADVERSE FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS.

THE COMPANY OFFERS AIRCRAFT FLEET SUPPORT FOR ALL ITS AIRCRAFT MODELS. THESE

COSTS INCLUDE FLIGHT AND MAINTENANCE TRAINING, FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT COSTS,

ENGINEERING SERVICES AND TECHNICAL DATA AND DOCUMENTS. THESE COSTS ARE

EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND DO NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY WITH CURRENT PRODUCTION

RATES. THE COSTS INCURRED TO SUSTAIN THIS SUPPORT AVERAGED LESS THAN 1.5%

OF TOTAL COSTS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR THE PERIODS DISCLOSED.

THE COMPANY PROJECTS SIGNIFICANT MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMMERCIAL

AVIATION SUPPORT MARKET OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO

THE NEED FOR AVIATION SUPPORT INCLUDE DEREGULATION, PRIVATIZATION AND

GLOBALIZATION, WHICH HAVE INCREASED COMPETITION AND FORCED AIRLINES TO

OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY. THE COMPANY WILL FOCUS ON TOTAL LIFE-CYCLE

OPPORTUNITIES, WHICH INCLUDE AIRPLANE SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE, AND

AIRPORT AND ROUTE INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES.

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS FOR

2001, 2000 AND 1999 WERE $1,346 MILLION, $1,245 MILLION AND $1,161 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. THE SEGMENT OPERATING MARGINS FOR 2001, 2000 AND 1999 WERE

10.8%, 10.4% AND 9.8%, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2001 OPERATING RESULTS REFLECT

STRONG PROFITS ON MAJOR PRODUCTION PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE

C-17 GLOBEMASTER, F/A-18E/F SUPER HORNET, T-45 GOSHAWK, AV-8B HARRIER,

AND THE HARPOON MISSILE. THE SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS FOR 2001 INCLUDE

THE RECOGNITION OF $48 MILLION OF CHARGES RELATING TO ASSET REDUCTIONS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED WORK VOLUME AT THE PHILADELPHIA SITE, AND $46

MILLION OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER PROGRAM AND

IDLE MANUFACTURING ASSETS. THE 2001 OPERATING EARNINGS ALSO INCLUDED A

FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT OF $57 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO F-15 PROGRAM CHARGES

RECOGNIZED IN 1999. EXCLUSIVE OF THESE ITEMS, THE SEGMENT OPERATING MARGINS

FOR 2001 WERE 11.1%. INCLUDED IN THE 1999 OPERATING RESULTS WERE A FAVORABLE

CONTRACT SETTLEMENT AMOUNTING TO $55 MILLION AND PRETAX CHARGES OF $270

MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE F-15 PROGRAM. EXCLUSIVE OF THESE ITEMS, SEGMENT

OPERATING MARGINS FOR 1999 WERE 11.6%.

A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT

BUSINESS HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT-TYPE

CONTRACTS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE LOWER PROFIT MARGINS THAN FIXED-PRICE-TYPE

CONTRACTS. CURRENT MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE F-22 RAPTOR,

V-22 OSPREY TILTROTOR AIRCRAFT, C-130 AMP AND THE RAH-66 COMANCHE HELICOPTER.

BOTH THE V-22 AND F-22 PROGRAMS HAVE TRANSITIONED TO LOW-RATE INITIAL

PRODUCTION, BUT ALSO CONTINUE DEVELOPMENTAL ACTIVITIES.

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS, PRIOR TO NON-RECURRING

ITEMS, FOR 2001 WERE $619 MILLION, $340 MILLION IN 2000 AND $320 MILLION IN

1999, AND THE RELATED OPERATING MARGINS WERE 6.0%, 4.2% AND 4.7% FOR 2001,

2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2000 OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDED A NON-

RECURRING PRETAX CHARGE OF $505 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE IN-PROCESS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FROM THE ACQUISITION OF THE HUGHES SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES (RENAMED BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS) AND AUTOMETRIC

BUSINESSES, ALONG WITH $78 MILLION IN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A DELTA III

DEMONSTRATION LAUNCH IN AUGUST 2000. THE 1999 OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDED

A PRETAX GAIN OF $95 MILLION RELATED TO THE SALE OF BOEING INFORMATION

SYSTEMS TO SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION.

THE 2001 SEGMENT OPERATING MARGINS IMPROVED OVER 2000 DUE TO EXCELLENT

INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION ON-ORBIT PERFORMANCE, AND IMPROVED INTEGRATED

DEFENSE SYSTEMS AND GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE PROGRAM PERFORMANCE.

THESE MARGINS WERE REDUCED BY COMPANY INVESTMENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

PRODUCTS, IN PARTICULAR, THE DELTA IV LAUNCH VEHICLE AND THE 737 AIRBORNE

EARLY WARNING & CONTROL SYSTEM (AEW&C;) PROGRAM. ADDITIONALLY, EARNINGS WERE

IMPACTED BY $131 MILLION FOR THE AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED

INTANGIBLES PRINCIPALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF BOEING SATELLITE

SYSTEMS. THE COMPANY PROJECTS THAT 2002 OPERATING EARNINGS WILL CONTINUE TO

BE IMPACTED BY NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES BUT TO A LESSER DEGREE THAN

IN PRIOR YEARS, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TRANSITION OF THE DELTA IV LAUNCH

VEHICLE INTO PRODUCTION. PROGRAM MARGINS FOR THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

SEGMENT, EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING ITEMS AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WERE

11.0% IN 2001 AND 10.8% IN 2000.

45

46

SIGNIFICANT RISK REMAINS RELATED TO WORK IN PROCESS INVENTORY AND SUPPLIER

COMMITMENTS FOR THE DELTA III PROGRAM. IN ORDER TO MITIGATE SOME OF THIS RISK,

FOUR DELTA IIIS WERE CONVERTED TO DELTA IIS IN 2001. THESE RISK ASSESSMENTS

REMAIN CLOSELY MONITORED, AND ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR CONVERSIONS ARE

UNDER REVIEW.

CERTAIN SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT LAUNCH AND SATELLITE CONTRACTS

INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR REPLACEMENT LAUNCH SERVICES OR HARDWARE IF SPECIFIED

PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ARE NOT MET. THE COMPANY HAS HISTORICALLY PURCHASED

INSURANCE TO COVER THESE OBLIGATIONS WHEN ALLOWED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE

CONTRACT. DUE TO RECENT EVENTS, THE CURRENT INSURANCE MARKET REFLECTS

UNUSUALLY HIGH PREMIUM RATES AND ALSO SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF CAPACITY TO

HANDLE ALL INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANY MAY THEREFORE ELECT TO FORGO

THE PROCUREMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE AND, INSTEAD, RETAIN SUCH RISKS

INTERNALLY. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE CONTRACT COST ESTIMATES HAVE SUFFICIENT

PROVISIONS TO COVER THE EXPECTED VALUE FOR THESE RISKS.

VARIOUS SATELLITE CONTRACTS CONTAIN TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA THAT

REQUIRE ONGOING EXECUTION TO ACHIEVE. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT COSTS AND

PERFORMANCE ESTIMATES USED TO RECORD PROGRAM PROFIT ARE APPROPRIATE; HOWEVER,

FAILURE TO ACHIEVE TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD PUT

CERTAIN CONTRACTS AT RISK, INCLUDING RISK OF COST OVERRUNS AND RISK OF

CONTRACT DEFAULT.

THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE IN WHICH BOEING IS A 40% PARTNER WITH RSC ENERGIA

(25%) OF RUSSIA, KVAERNER MARITIME (20%) OF NORWAY, AND KB YUZHNOYE/PO

YUZHMACH (15%) OF UKRAINE HAD TWO SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHES IN 2001. BOEING'S

INVESTMENT IN THIS VENTURE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, IS REPORTED AT ZERO,

WHICH REFLECTS THE PRIOR RECOGNITION OF LOSSES REPORTED BY SEA LAUNCH.

THE VENTURE INCURRED LOSSES IN 2001, DUE TO THE RELATIVELY LOW VOLUME OF

LAUNCHES, REFLECTING A DEPRESSED SATELLITE MARKET. BOEING HAS FINANCIAL

EXPOSURE WITH RESPECT TO THE VENTURE, WHICH RELATES TO GUARANTEES BY THE

COMPANY PROVIDED TO CERTAIN SEA LAUNCH CREDITORS, PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES

PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY TO A SEA LAUNCH CUSTOMER AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE

RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE/INVENTORY REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. NET OF LIABILITIES ESTABLISHED, THE COMPANY'S MAXIMUM

EXPOSURE TO CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT GUARANTEES AMOUNTS

TO $357 MILLION, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN THE DISCLOSURE IN NOTE 24 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. FINANCIAL EXPOSURE RELATED TO

PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE/INVENTORY AMOUNTED TO

$200 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001.

THE COMPANY AND LOCKHEED MARTIN ARE 50-50 PARTNERS IN UNITED SPACE

ALLIANCE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL GROUND PROCESSING OF THE SPACE

SHUTTLE FLEET AND FOR SPACE-RELATED OPERATIONS WITH THE U.S. AIR FORCE.

UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE ALSO PERFORMS MODIFICATIONS, TESTING AND CHECKOUT

OPERATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO READY THE SPACE SHUTTLE FOR LAUNCH. UNITED

SPACE ALLIANCE OPERATIONS ARE PERFORMED UNDER COST-PLUS-TYPE CONTRACTS. THE

COMPANY'S PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF JOINT VENTURE EARNINGS IS RECOGNIZED AS

INCOME. THE SEGMENT'S OPERATING EARNINGS INCLUDE EARNINGS OF $72 MILLION,

$60 MILLION AND $48 MILLION FOR 2001, 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY,

ATTRIBUTABLE TO UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE.

46

47

CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING

OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING

SEGMENT WERE $596 MILLION FOR 2001, $516 MILLION FOR 2000 AND $454 MILLION

FOR 1999, EXCLUSIVE OF INTEREST EXPENSE. THE INCREASED OPERATING EARNINGS

IN 2001 REFLECT THE IMPACT OF THE INCREASED SEGMENT REVENUES RESULTING FROM

THE INCREASE IN FINANCING ASSETS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL

FINANCING SEGMENT.

BEGINNING IN 2000 AND CONTINUING THROUGH 2001, CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL

FINANCING SEGMENT ASSETS WERE TRANSFERRED TO BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION

(BCC), AND AS OF YEAR-END 2001, SIGNIFICANTLY ALL OF THE SEGMENT'S ASSETS

RESIDE WITHIN BCC. BEGINNING IN 2002, THE COMPANY INTENDS TO USE BCC AS

THE BASIS OF CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING SEGMENT REPORTING. IN 2001,

$324 MILLION OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE OF $650

MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO BCC. BEGINNING IN 2002, THE CUSTOMER AND

COMMERCIAL FINANCING SEGMENT WILL REFLECT THE OPERATIONS OF BCC.

OTHER

OTHER SEGMENT EARNINGS WERE A LOSS OF $388 MILLION IN 2001, A LOSS OF

$76 MILLION IN 2000 AND $4 MILLION IN 1999. THE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTOR

TO LOSSES DURING THIS PERIOD HAS BEEN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITY

RELATING TO CONNEXION BY BOEINGSM AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, AIR TRAFFIC

MANAGEMENT. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OTHER

SEGMENT WAS $294 MILLION IN 2001, $84 MILLION IN 2000 AND $5 MILLION IN

1999. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE OTHER SEGMENT FOR 2001 ARE LOSSES RELATING TO

INTERCOMPANY GUARANTEE PAYMENTS MADE TO BCC AMOUNTING TO $49 MILLION AND

OPERATING EARNINGS OF $23 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO FINANCING ASSETS NOT

INTENDED TO BE TRANSFERRED TO BCC. AS OF 2001, THESE FINANCING ASSETS

CONSISTED OF FOUR C-17 TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT LEASED TO THE UNITED KINGDOM

ROYAL AIR FORCE.

EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001

ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE UNITED STATES WAS THE TARGET OF SEVERE TERRORIST

ATTACKS THAT INVOLVED THE USE OF U.S. COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURED BY

THE COMPANY. THESE ATTACKS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF LIFE AND

PROPERTY AND CAUSED MAJOR DISRUPTIONS IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND IN THE U.S.

ECONOMY OVERALL.

TO ADDRESS THE WIDESPREAD FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE ATTACKS, THE EMERGING

ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) RELEASED ISSUE NO. 01-10, "ACCOUNTING FOR THE

IMPACT OF TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001." THIS ISSUE SPECIFICALLY

PROHIBITS TREATING COSTS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE EVENTS OF

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AS EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS; HOWEVER,IT OBSERVES THAT ANY

PORTION OF THESE COSTS AND LOSSES DEEMED TO BE UNUSUAL OR INFREQUENTLY

OCCURRING SHOULD BE PRESENTED AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN INCOME FROM

CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF

$935 MILLION IN THE CAPTION 'SPECIAL CHARGES DUE TO EVENTS OF

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.' THIS CHARGE RELATED TO THE CATEGORIES LISTED

BELOW. OF THIS CHARGE, $908 MILLION IS RELATED TO THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

SEGMENT AND $27 MILLION IS RELATED TO THE OTHER SEGMENT.

EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE

THE COMPANY INCURRED AND IS EXPECTED TO INCUR EMPLOYMENT REDUCTIONS

RESULTING FROM THE DECREASE IN AIRCRAFT DEMAND, WHICH DIRECTLY RELATED TO

THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001,

47

48

THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $287 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ASSOCIATED

EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE OBLIGATIONS.

717 FORWARD LOSS

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001, THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY OF THE 717 PROGRAM

WAS REVISED TO 135 UNITS FROM 200 UNITS. THIS REVISION RESULTED FROM A LACK

OF FIRM DEMAND FOR THE 717 AIRCRAFT SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AND THE

UNCERTAINTY IN ESTIMATING FUTURE REVENUES AND COSTS FOR 200 UNITS BASED UPON

THE REVISED PROJECTED DELIVERY SCHEDULE. THE FORWARD LOSS OF $250 MILLION

REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT BY WHICH, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE INVENTORY BALANCE

PLUS ESTIMATED FUTURE INVENTORY COSTS EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED REVENUE FOR THE

UNDELIVERED AIRCRAFT WITHIN THE REVISED ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY CUMULATIVELY DELIVERED 93 717 PROGRAM AIRCRAFT.

THE ESTIMATES FOR THE REVISED ACCOUNTING QUANTITY ASSUME THAT THE 717 WILL

REMAIN AN ONGOING PROGRAM. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO PLANS TO DO SO, IF THE

PROGRAM WERE TO BE TERMINATED AFTER THE DELIVERY OF 135 UNITS, THE COMPANY

WOULD BE EXPOSED TO POTENTIALLY MATERIAL TERMINATION COSTS.

USED AIRCRAFT VALUATION

THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE

MARKET VALUE OF USED AIRCRAFT. THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $185 MILLION

RELATING TO THE DECREASE IN MARKET VALUE FOR AIRCRAFT HELD FOR RESALE AS WELL

AS ASSET PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO TRADE-IN OF USED AIRCRAFT.

INVENTORY VALUATION

THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $96 MILLION RELATING TO EXCESS AND OBSOLETE

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE SPARES INVENTORY. SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 11, 2001,

COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE REMOVED A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT

FROM SERVICE. THE ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF FUTURE SALES FOR SPECIFIC SPARE PARTS

HELD IN INVENTORY IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ACTIVE AIRCRAFT FLEET IN WHICH THAT

SPARE PART SUPPORTS. THE REVISED PROJECTIONS FOR FUTURE DEMAND OF CERTAIN SPARE

PARTS INDICATE THAT CURRENT INVENTORY QUANTITIES ARE IN EXCESS OF TOTAL EXPECTED

FUTURE DEMAND.

VENDOR PENALTIES

THE DECREASE IN PRODUCTION RATES ON CERTAIN COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE MODELS AND

RELATED PRODUCTS TRIGGERED CONTRACTUAL PENALTY CLAUSES WITH VARIOUS VENDORS

AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AND THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $68 MILLION FOR THESE

PENALTIES. THE DECREASE IN PRODUCTION RATES RESULTED DIRECTLY FROM THE CHANGE

IN AIRCRAFT DEMAND AFTER THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.

GUARANTEE COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS EXTENDED CERTAIN GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS SUCH AS ASSET VALUE

GUARANTEES DISCUSSED IN NOTE 24. BASED UPON THE IMPACT OF THE EVENTS OF

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, ON AIRCRAFT MARKET PRICES AND AIRCRAFT DEMAND OF CUSTOMERS

WHO ARE COUNTERPARTIES IN THESE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $49

MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH AN ADVERSE EXPOSURE UNDER THESE GUARANTEES.

ONGOING ASSESSMENTS

THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS OTHER POTENTIAL LOSSES AND COSTS IT MIGHT

INCUR IN RELATION TO THE ATTACKS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT YET ACCRUABLE;

HOWEVER, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT SUCH COSTS MAY BE INCURRED THROUGHOUT 2002.

LIABILITIES TOTALLING $542 MILLION WERE ESTABLISHED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001,

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CHARGES AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE SETTLED BY THE END OF

2002. ANY COSTS OR ADJUSTMENTS IN ESTIMATES WILL CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED AS

A SEPARATE COMPONENT OF EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS ENTITLED 'SPECIAL CHARGES

DUE TO EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.'

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES CHARGED DIRECTLY TO EARNINGS INCLUDE

DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED TEST ACTIVITIES FOR NEW AND DERIVATIVE

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT, OTHER COMPANY-SPONSORED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND

BASIC RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING AMOUNTS ALLOCABLE AS OVERHEAD COSTS

ON U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN 2001 WAS $1,936 MILLION, COMPARED

WITH $1,998 MILLION IN 2000 AND $1,341 MILLION IN 1999. EXCLUDING THE

$557 MILLION OF IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D;) EXPENSE IN 2000,

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE INCREASED $495 MILLION IN 2001, PRINCIPALLY

REFLECTING INCREASES IN THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT AND THE OTHER SEGMENT,

WHICH INCLUDES ACTIVITIES RELATING TO CONNEXION BY BOEINGSM. EXCLUDING IPR&D;,

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE INCREASED $100 MILLION IN 2000, PRINCIPALLY

DUE TO INCREASES FROM THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (EXCLUDING IPR&D;).

[GRAPHIC AND IMAGE MATERIAL ITEM NUMBER 2

SEE APPENDIX ON PAGE 188 FOR DESCRIPTION]

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $858 MILLION IN

2001, $574 MILLION IN 2000 AND $585 MILLION IN 1999. THE INCREASE IN 2001

OVER 2000 REFLECTS INCREASED SPENDING ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF TWO

LONGER-RANGE 777 MODELS (777-300ER AND 777-200LR), A LONGER-RANGE 747-400

(747-400ER) AND A SONIC CRUISER AIRPLANE.

IN ADDITION TO THE 777-300ER, 777-200LR AND THE 747-400ER, THE PRINCIPAL

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS DURING THE 1999-2001 PERIOD WERE

THE 767-400ER, AND THE 737-900. IN 2001, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE 777-200LR

PROGRAM HAD BEEN REPHASED APPROXIMATELY 18 MONTHS.

THE INITIAL DELIVERY OF THE 737-900, THE LARGEST MEMBER OF THE

NEXT-GENERATION 737 FAMILY OCCURRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2001. THE

INITIAL DELIVERY OF THE 767-400ER, A STRETCHED VERSION OF 767-300ER,

OCCURRED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2000. THE INITIAL DELIVERY OF THE 757-300,

A STRETCHED DERIVATIVE OF THE 757-200, OCCURRED IN MARCH 1999.

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS

THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT CONTINUES TO PURSUE

BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WHERE IT CAN USE ITS CUSTOMER KNOWLEDGE, TECHNICAL

STRENGTH AND LARGE-SCALE INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES. THE SEGMENT'S LEVEL OF

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS APPROACH,

AND REFLECTS THE RECENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, WHICH HAS PRESENTED FEW MAJOR

NEW-START OPPORTUNITIES. CURRENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES FOCUS

ON NEAR AND LONG-TERM CUSTOMER NEEDS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES

ARE PROVIDING SYSTEM UPGRADE AND TECHNOLOGY INSERTIONS TO ENHANCE THE

CAPABILITY AND COMPETITIVENESS OF EXISTING PRODUCT LINES INCLUDING APACHE,

C-17, F-15E, F/A-18E/F, AND THE JOINT DIRECT ATTACK MUNITION (JDAM).

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INITIATIVES TO BRING NEW CAPABILITIES AND PRODUCTS

TO THE MARKET INCLUDE THE CANARD ROTOR WING (CRW), RAH-66 COMANCHE, ADVANCED

TACTICAL TRANSPORT (ATT), MULTIMISSION MARITIME AIRCRAFT (MMA), THE E/A-18

ELECTRONIC ATTACK AIRCRAFT, THE SMALL DIAMETER BOMB (SDB) AND THE

767 TANKER PROGRAM. MILITARY AIRCRAFT & MISSILE SYSTEMS IS CONDUCTING

EXTENSIVE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ON THE UNMANNED SYSTEMS INCLUDING THE U.S.

AIR FORCE'S UNMANNED COMBAT AIR VEHICLE (UCAV) AND ITS NAVAL COUNTERPART

(UCAV-N).                             49

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE, EXCLUDING IN-PROCESS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WAS $526 MILLION IN 2001 AND 2000, AND $492 MILLION

IN 1999. SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AT THE SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT CONTINUED DURING 2001. COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES SUPPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DELTA IV LAUNCH

VEHICLE AND THE 737-BASED AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING & CONTROL AIRCRAFT. DELTA IV

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE HAS BEEN REDUCED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S PARTICIPATION IN

DEVELOPING THE EVOLVED EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE (EELV). COMPANY-SPONSORED

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LEVELS ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE IN 2002 DUE TO THE

TRANSITION OF THE DELTA IV LAUNCH VEHICLE INTO PRODUCTION.

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RECOGNIZED IN 2000

THE FAIR VALUE AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION OF IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D;) ATTRIBUTED TO THE HUGHES ACQUISITION IN 2000

DISCUSSED BELOW WAS DETERMINED BY AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION USING THE

INCOME APPROACH.

THIRTEEN PROJECTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE VALUATION, OF WHICH THE PRINCIPAL

PROJECTS WERE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING: TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATED WITH

HIGH-EFFICIENCY SOLAR CELLS AND SATELLITE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY ($189 MILLION),

PHASED ARRAY AND DIGITAL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE HIGH-SPEED

BROADBAND SERVICE ($89 MILLION), AND XENON-ION SYSTEMS FOR SATELLITE ENGINE

PROPULSION ($82 MILLION). THE FAIR VALUE OF IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES WAS ALSO

DETERMINED BY AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION PRIMARILY USING THE INCOME APPROACH.

THE FOLLOWING RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATES WERE USED TO DISCOUNT THE PROJECT

CASH FLOWS: SOLAR CELLS AND SATELLITE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY, 17%; PHASED ARRAY

AND DIGITAL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND SERVICE,

18%; XENON-ION SYSTEMS FOR SATELLITE ENGINE PROPULSION, 18%; ALL OTHER

PROJECTS, 18.2% WEIGHTED AVERAGE. OPERATING MARGINS WERE ASSUMED TO BE

SIMILAR TO HISTORICAL MARGINS OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS. THE SIZE OF THE APPLICABLE

MARKET WAS VERIFIED FOR REASONABLENESS WITH OUTSIDE RESEARCH SOURCES. THE

PROJECTS WERE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF COMPLETION RANGING FROM APPROXIMATELY

31% TO 92% COMPLETE AS OF THE VALUATION DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE

PERCENTAGES COMPLETE BY PROJECT WERE AS FOLLOWS: SOLAR CELLS AND SATELLITE

BATTERY TECHNOLOGY, 80%; PHASED ARRAY AND DIGITAL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY,

95%; XENON-ION SYSTEMS FOR SATELLITE ENGINE PROPULSION, 90%. THE STAGE OF

COMPLETION FOR EACH PROJECT WAS ESTIMATED BY EVALUATING THE COST TO

COMPLETE, COMPLEXITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND TIME TO MARKET. THE PROJECTS ARE

ANTICIPATED TO BE COMPLETED BETWEEN 2002 AND 2004. THE ESTIMATED COST TO

COMPLETE THE PROJECTS IS $50 MILLION.

THE DISCOUNT RATES STATED PREVIOUSLY ARE HIGHER THAN THE COMPANY'S WEIGHTED

AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES IN THE ESTIMATES

DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY, INCLUDING THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE SUCCESSFUL

COMPLETION OF THE PURCHASED IN-PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, THE USEFUL LIFE OF SUCH

TECHNOLOGY, THE PROFITABILITY LEVELS OF SUCH TECHNOLOGY AND THE UNCERTAINTY

OF THE TIMING OF THE RELATED PRODUCT INTRODUCTION AND THEN-EXISTING COMPETING

PRODUCTS. IF THESE PROJECTS ARE NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED, THE FUTURE REVENUE

AND PROFITABILITY OF BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

ADDITIONALLY, THE VALUE OF THE OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED MAY BECOME

IMPAIRED.

THE FAIR VALUE AMOUNT OF $45 MILLION OF IPR&D; ATTRIBUTED TO THE ACQUISITION

OF JEPPESEN SANDERSON, INC., WAS DETERMINED BY AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION. THE

ACQUIRED IPR&D; TECHNOLOGY CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THREE SOFTWARE PROJECTS THAT

WILL WORK TOGETHER TO STORE INFORMATION AND EXTRACT IT FOR USE IN VARIOUS

PRODUCTS SOLD BY JEPPESEN. THE TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW THE PRODUCTION OF END

USER AERONAUTICAL INFORMATION WITH FORWARD AND BACKWARD DATE EFFECTIVITY,

AND WILL ALLOW THE EXTRACTION OF THE INFORMATION ON A NEAR REAL TIME BASIS.

FURTHERMORE, THE TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW THE CREATION OF PACKAGES OF

AERONAUTICAL INFORMATION, WHICH CAN BE TAILORED TO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS

WORLDWIDE. THESE ACQUIRED IPR&D; PROJECTS WERE COMPLETED DURING 2001, WITH

THE FULL RANGE AND PRODUCTION OF THE TECHNOLOGY ANTICIPATED IN THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2002. THE COMPLETED TECHNOLOGY CAN ONLY BE USED FOR ITS SPECIFIC

AND INTENDED PURPOSE AND AS SUCH NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES EXIST. THE

VALUATION METHODOLOGY WAS DETERMINED USING THE INCOME APPROACH, AND A

RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE OF 15% WAS USED TO DISCOUNT THE PROJECT CASH

FLOW. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, JEPPESEN HAD COMPLETED ALL

IPR&D; PROJECTS FOR A TOTAL COST OF $18 MILLION.

OTHER ACQUISITIONS RESULTING IN THE RECOGNITION OF IPR&D; DURING 2000

USING A SIMILAR INCOME APPROACH INCLUDED CONTINENTAL GRAPHICS CORP.

($7 MILLION IPR&D;) AND AUTOMETRIC, INC. ($5 MILLION IPR&D;).

INCOME TAXES

THE 2001 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 20.7% INCLUDES A ONE-TIME BENEFIT

OF $343 MILLION REFLECTING A SETTLEMENT WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE

RELATING TO RESEARCH CREDIT CLAIMS ON MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION

FIXED-PRICE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS APPLICABLE TO THE 1986-1992 FEDERAL

INCOME TAX RETURNS. ABSENT THIS SETTLEMENT, THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR

2001 WOULD BE 30.3%, WHICH VARIES FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF

35%, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO FOREIGN SALES CORPORATION (FSC) AND

EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME (ETI) EXCLUSION TAX BENEFITS OF $222 MILLION.

OFFSETTING THIS BENEFIT ARE STATE INCOME TAXES AND THE NON-DEDUCTIBILITY

OF CERTAIN GOODWILL, PRINCIPALLY THE GOODWILL ACQUIRED BY THE ACQUISITION

OF THE AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE UNITS FROM ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION

IN 1996.

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES OF 29.0% FOR 2000 AND 30.5% FOR 1999 ALSO

VARY FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE PRINCIPALLY DUE TO FSC BENEFITS

OF $291 MILLION IN 2000 AND $230 MILLION IN 1999.

IN FEBRUARY 2000, THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) APPELLATE BODY UPHELD

A PANEL DECISION THAT U.S. FSC TAX PROVISIONS CONSTITUTED A PROHIBITED EXPORT

SUBSIDY. IN RESPONSE, IN NOVEMBER 2000, THE UNITED STATES ENACTED LEGISLATION

TO REPEAL THE FSC TAX PROVISIONS, SUBJECT TO TRANSITION RULES, AND ENACTED

REPLACEMENT LEGISLATION (THE EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME EXCLUSION ACT OF 2000).

THE EUROPEAN UNION OBJECTED TO THIS ETI EXCLUSION, AND IN NOVEMBER 2001 ASKED

THE WTO TO AUTHORIZE TRADE SANCTIONS ON A LIST OF GOODS, INCLUDING AIRCRAFT,

PRODUCED IN THE UNITED STATES. IN JANUARY 2002, THE APPELLATE BODY OF THE WTO

UPHELD A RULING THAT THE UNITED STATES HAD FAILED TO WITHDRAW THE PROHIBITED

FSC EXPORT SUBSIDY. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IS CURRENTLY REVIEWING ITS OPTIONS IN

RESPONSE TO THIS DECISION. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHAT IMPACT, IF ANY,

THIS ISSUE WILL HAVE ON FUTURE EARNINGS PENDING FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE

CHALLENGE.

ACQUISITIONS IN 2000

ON OCTOBER 6, 2000, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED THE HUGHES ELECTRONICS CORPORATION

(HUGHES) SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS AND RELATED BUSINESSES. THE ACQUISITION WAS

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD, BY WHICH THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS

ALLOCATED TO THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED BASED ON PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES OF THEIR

FAIR VALUES. THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE WAS $3,849 MILLION, INITIAL GOODWILL

WAS VALUED AT $740 MILLION AND THE OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE VALUED AT

$631 MILLION. DURING THE PERIOD FROM ACQUISITION TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2001,

THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED AND GOODWILL

WAS INCREASED TO A BALANCE OF $2,166 MILLION. INCLUDED IN GOODWILL ARE CERTAIN

CLAIMS SUBMITTED TO HUGHES FOR RESOLUTION AS CONTRACTUAL PURCHASE PRICE

CONTINGENCIES. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES FINALIZING THE HUGHES PURCHASE PRICE

ALLOCATION DURING LATE 2002 OR EARLY 2003, AT THE CONCLUSION OF ARBITRATION

PROCEDURES RELATED TO THESE CONTINGENCIES. OTHER ADJUSTMENTS WERE RECORDED TO

REFLECT FINALIZATION OF FAIR VALUE ASSESSMENTS FOR THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED AND

THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING POLICIES ON ACQUIRED BALANCES.

OTHER ACQUISITIONS IN 2000 INCLUDED JEPPESEN SANDERSON, INC. FOR $1,524 MILLION

IN CASH, CONTINENTAL GRAPHICS CORP. FOR $183 MILLION IN CASH, AND

AUTOMETRIC, INC. FOR $119 MILLION IN CASH.

LABOR NEGOTIATIONS AND WORKFORCE LEVELS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING

AGREEMENTS WERE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS AND AEROSPACE

WORKERS (IAM), REPRESENTING 24% OF EMPLOYEES (CURRENT AGREEMENTS EXPIRING

SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER 2002, AND MAY 2004); THE SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL

ENGINEERING EMPLOYEES IN AEROSPACE (SPEEA), REPRESENTING 14% OF EMPLOYEES

(CURRENT AGREEMENTS EXPIRING IN DECEMBER 2002 AND FEBRUARY 2004); THE UNITED

AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS OF AMERICA (UAW),

REPRESENTING 4% OF EMPLOYEES (CURRENT AGREEMENTS EXPIRING SEPTEMBER 2002,

MAY 2003, AND APRIL 2004); AND SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING

ASSOCIATION (SCPEA), REPRESENTING 2% OF EMPLOYEES (CURRENT AGREEMENT

EXPIRING MARCH 2005).

THE COMPANY'S WORKFORCE LEVEL WAS 188,000 AT DECEMBER 31, 2001.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

-------------------------------

THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS AND

LIQUIDITY POSITION, OTHER THAN OPERATING RESULTS ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT SALES

ACTIVITY, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: TIMING OF NEW AND DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRING

BOTH HIGH DEVELOPMENTAL EXPENDITURES AND INITIAL INVENTORY BUILDUP; CYCLICAL

FACTORS, INCLUDING GROWTH AND EXPANSION REQUIREMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED

WITH REDUCING SALES LEVELS; CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSISTANCE; THE TIMING OF FEDERAL

INCOME TAX PAYMENTS; THE COMPANY'S STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN; AND POTENTIAL

ACQUISITIONS.

CASH FLOW SUMMARY

FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF COMPANY CASH FLOWS BASED ON CHANGES IN CASH AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THIS CASH FLOW SUMMARY IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS ON PAGE 31 THAT ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, BUT IS INTENDED TO HIGHLIGHT AND

FACILITATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPAL CASH FLOW ELEMENTS. FREE CASH FLOW IS

DEFINED AS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS LESS CHANGE IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS,

REDUCED BY FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT EXPENDITURES.

(A) NON-CASH CHARGES TO EARNINGS AS PRESENTED HERE CONSIST OF DEPRECIATION,

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AMORTIZATION, RETIREE HEALTH CARE

ACCRUALS, CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING VALUATION PROVISION AND

SHARE-BASED PLANS EXPENSE. THE COMPANY HAS NOT FUNDED RETIREE HEALTH

CARE ACCRUALS AND, AT THIS TIME, HAS NO PLAN TO FUND THESE ACCRUALS IN

THE FUTURE. THE SHARE-BASED PLANS DO NOT IMPACT CURRENT OR FUTURE CASH

FLOW, EXCEPT FOR THE ASSOCIATED POSITIVE CASH FLOW TAX IMPLICATIONS.

SHARE-BASED PLANS EXPENSE IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE IN THE NEAR TERM

AS ADDITIONAL ANNUAL PERFORMANCE SHARE GRANTS ARE MADE. SEE NOTE 22 TO

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

(B) THE DECREASE IN INVENTORY ALSO RESULTED FROM IMPROVED INVENTORY TURNS

IN 2000 AND 2001 AND DECREASED PRODUCTION RATES IN 2000.

(C) THE CHANGES IN COMMERCIAL CUSTOMER ADVANCES DURING 1999, 2000 AND 2001

WERE BROADLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE COMMERCIAL JET PROGRAMS, AND GENERALLY

CORRESPOND TO ORDERS AND PRODUCTION RATE LEVELS.

53

54

(D) THE TOTAL CHANGE IN RECEIVABLES, LIABILITIES, INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND

DEFERRED, AND OTHER RESULTED IN A NET ASSET DECREASE OF $0.2 BILLION FOR

THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD PRESENTED. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT ELEMENT OF THIS

CHANGE RELATED TO INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND DEFERRED, WHERE THE DECREASE

IN CASH FOR 2001 ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE ACCOUNTS AMOUNTED TO $0.5 BILLION.

THE SUBSTANTIAL TAX PAYMENTS IN 2001 ($1.5 BILLION, COMPARED WITH $0.4

BILLION IN 2000 AND $0.6 BILLION IN 1999) RESULTED PRINCIPALLY FROM

PAYMENTS DUE TO THE COMPLETION OF CONTRACTS EXECUTED UNDER PRIOR TAX

REGULATIONS. FUTURE TAX PAYMENTS ARE NOT ANTICIPATED TO DEVIATE

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM FUTURE TAX PROVISIONS.

(E) PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSITIONS INCLUDE RECEIPTS FROM THE SALE OF SUBSIDIARIES

AND THE SALE OF REAL PROPERTY. INCLUDED IN THE PROCEEDS FOR 1999 ARE

RECEIPTS OF APPROXIMATELY $162 MILLION RELATED TO THE SALE OF BOEING

INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

(F) OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD 1999-2001, THE COMPANY GENERATED $4.6 BILLION

OF CASH FROM PRINCIPAL RECEIPTS AND BY SELLING CUSTOMER FINANCING

RECEIVABLES AND OPERATING LEASE ASSETS. OVER THE SAME PERIOD, ADDITIONS

TO CUSTOMER FINANCING AMOUNTED TO $10.0 BILLION. THESE NET INCREASES IN

CUSTOMER FINANCING HAVE BEEN PRINCIPALLY FUNDED BY DEBT. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY

$7.5 BILLION TO ARRANGE OR PROVIDE FINANCING RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER

OR UNDER OPTION FOR DELIVERIES SCHEDULED THROUGH THE YEAR 2010. NOT ALL

THESE COMMITMENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE USED; HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

THESE COMMITMENTS ARE WITH PARTIES WITH RELATIVELY LOW CREDIT RATINGS. SEE

NOTE 25 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONCERNING CONCENTRATION

OF CREDIT RISK. OUTSTANDING LOANS AND COMMITMENTS ARE PRIMARILY SECURED BY

THE UNDERLYING AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT.

(G) DEBT MATURITIES DURING THIS THREE-YEAR PERIOD INCLUDED $538 MILLION IN 2001,

$480 MILLION IN 2000 AND $650 MILLION IN 1999. ADDITIONALLY, BOEING CAPITAL

CORPORATION (BCC), A CORPORATION WHOLLY OWNED BY THE COMPANY, ISSUED $3.9

BILLION OF DEBT IN 2001, $2.0 BILLION IN 2000 AND $400 MILLION IN 1999. THE

SIGNIFICANT BCC DEBT ISSUANCE IN 2000 AND 2001 WAS PERFORMED IN CONJUNCTION

WITH THE TRANSFER OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMER

FINANCING ASSETS TO BCC AS WELL AS GROWTH IN THE CUSTOMER FINANCING

PORTFOLIO.

(H) IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 1998, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A SHARE REPURCHASE

PROGRAM TO BUY UP TO 15% OF THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK. THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 35.2 MILLION SHARES OF STOCK FOR $1.3

BILLION IN 1998, 68.9 MILLION SHARES FOR $2.9 BILLION IN 1999, AND 41.8

MILLION SHARES FOR $2.4 BILLION IN 2000, WHICH COMPLETED THE SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000, THE COMPANY AUTHORIZED

AN ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR UP TO 85 MILLION ADDITIONAL

SHARES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY HAD REPURCHASED 40.7 MILLION

SHARES FOR $2.4 BILLION.

UNCONDITIONAL PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED INTO SIGNIFICANT LONG-TERM PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS WITH A

LARGE NETWORK OF SUPPLIERS. THE NEED FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUPPLIERS AND

VENDORS ARISES DUE TO THE EXTENDED PRODUCTION PLANNING HORIZON FOR MANY OF ITS

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT, MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND OTHER PRODUCTS

WHERE THE DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER IS OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS ARE EITHER SUPPORTED BY A

FIRM CONTRACT FROM A CUSTOMER OR HAVE HISTORICALLY RESULTED IN SETTLEMENT

THROUGH EITHER TERMINATION PAYMENTS OR CONTRACT ADJUSTMENTS, WHEN NECESSARY,

SHOULD THE CUSTOMER BASE NOT MATERIALIZE TO SUPPORT DELIVERY FROM THE SUPPLIER.

THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL

RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY. SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE COMPANY UTILIZED

THE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM FOR THE FIRST TIME, PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SHORT-TERM

LIQUIDITY. COMMERCIAL PAPER REMAINS A SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY SOURCE, AND THE

COMPANY PLANS TO INCREASE THE AUTHORIZED COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM SIZE.

ON FEBRUARY 22, 2002, BCC FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION A

FORM S-3 REGISTRATION STATEMENT FOR A PUBLIC SHELF REGISTRATION OF $5.0 BILLION

OF DEBT SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY HAS LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF $11.8 BILLION, WHICH ARE

UNSECURED. APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION MATURE IN 2002, AND THE BALANCE HAS AN

AVERAGE MATURITY OF 11.8 YEARS. EXCLUDING BCC, TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT IS AT 32%

OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY PLUS DEBT. THE CONSOLIDATED LONG-TERM DEBT,

INCLUDING BCC, IS AT 53% OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY PLUS DEBT.

THE COMPANY HAS SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM BORROWING CAPABILITY.

REVOLVING CREDIT LINE AGREEMENTS WITH A GROUP OF MAJOR BANKS, TOTALING $4.5

BILLION, REMAIN AVAILABLE BUT UNUSED. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS INTERNALLY

GENERATED LIQUIDITY, TOGETHER WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL CAPITAL RESOURCES, WILL

BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY EXISTING COMMITMENTS AND PLANS, AND ALSO TO PROVIDE

ADEQUATE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF POTENTIAL STRATEGIC

BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD THEY ARISE WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR.

CONTINGENT ITEMS

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS,

CONTRACTS AND OTHER MATTERS ARE PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY. MOST SIGNIFICANT

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO MATTERS COVERED BY INSURANCE. MAJOR

CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF THE

ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THOSE FOR DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND

REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES. DUE IN PART TO THEIR COMPLEXITY AND

PERVASIVENESS, SUCH REQUIREMENTS HAVE RESULTED IN THE COMPANY BEING INVOLVED

WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS SINCE THE

1980S.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES, BASED ON IN-DEPTH STUDIES, EXPERT ANALYSES AND

LEGAL REVIEWS, ITS CONTINGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS FOR REMEDIATION

OF CONTAMINATED SITES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RANGES AND PROBABILITIES OF

RECOVERIES FROM OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO HAVE AND HAVE NOT AGREED TO A

SETTLEMENT AND OF RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS. THE COMPANY'S POLICY IS

TO IMMEDIATELY ACCRUE AND CHARGE TO CURRENT EXPENSE IDENTIFIED EXPOSURES

RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SITES BASED ON ESTIMATES OF

INVESTIGATION, CLEANUP AND MONITORING COSTS TO BE INCURRED.

THE COSTS INCURRED AND EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH

ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT HAD, AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE

COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION. WITH RESPECT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, RELATED

CHARGES HAVE AVERAGED LESS THAN 2% OF ANNUAL NET EARNINGS. SUCH ACCRUALS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001, WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR THE RELATED CONTINGENT RECOVERIES

FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS, ARE LESS THAN 2% OF TOTAL LIABILITIES.

56

57

BECAUSE OF THE REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES AND RISK OF UNIDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED

SITES AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

COSTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTIMATED COSTS ACCRUED FOR

IDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED SITES. HOWEVER, BASED ON ALL KNOWN FACTS AND EXPERT

ANALYSES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS NOT REASONABLY LIKELY THAT IDENTIFIED

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR OPERATING

RESULTS AND CASH FLOW TRENDS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS FROM WHICH CIVIL,

CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT. SUCH PROCEEDINGS COULD

INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES, COMPENSATORY AND

TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION AND/OR FORFEITURES. UNDER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS,

A COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS OPERATING DIVISIONS OR SUBDIVISIONS, CAN

ALSO BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, OR LOSE ITS EXPORT

PRIVILEGES, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES,

BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH GOVERNMENT

DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS

FINANCIAL POSITION OR CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

IN 1991, THE U.S. NAVY NOTIFIED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS (NOW A SUBSIDIARY OF THE

COMPANY) AND GENERAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION (THE "TEAM") THAT IT WAS TERMINATING

FOR DEFAULT THE TEAM'S CONTRACT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE

A-12 AIRCRAFT.  THE TEAM FILED A LEGAL ACTION TO CONTEST THE NAVY'S DEFAULT

TERMINATION, TO ASSERT ITS RIGHTS TO CONVERT THE TERMINATION TO ONE FOR "THE

CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT," AND TO OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COSTS

INCURRED ON THE A-12 CONTRACT BUT NOT PAID TO DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001,

INVENTORIES INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $583 MILLION OF RECORDED COSTS ON THE A-12

CONTRACT, AGAINST WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A LOSS PROVISION OF $350

MILLION. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVISION, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1990, WAS BASED

ON MCDONNELL DOUGLAS'S BELIEF, SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL,

THAT THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WOULD BE CONVERTED TO A TERMINATION FOR

CONVENIENCE, AND THAT THE UPPER RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS ON TERMINATION FOR

CONVENIENCE WAS $350 MILLION.

ON AUGUST 31, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ISSUED A DECISION AFTER

TRIAL UPHOLDING THE GOVERNMENT'S DEFAULT TERMINATION OF THE A-12 CONTRACT ON

THE GROUND THAT THE TEAM COULD NOT MEET THE REVISED CONTRACT SCHEDULE

UNILATERALLY IMPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT AFTER THE GOVERNMENT HAD WAIVED THE

ORIGINAL SCHEDULE. THE COURT DID NOT, HOWEVER, ENTER A JUDGMENT FOR THE

GOVERNMENT ON ITS CLAIM THAT THE TEAM BE REQUIRED, AS A CONSEQUENCE OF THE

ALLEGED DEFAULT, TO REPAY PROGRESS PAYMENTS THAT HAD NOT BEEN FORMALLY

LIQUIDATED BY DELIVERIES AT THE TIME OF TERMINATION. THESE UNLIQUIDATED

PROGRESS PAYMENTS TOTAL $1,350 MILLION. ON OCTOBER 4, 2001, THE COURT

CONFIRMED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ENTERING JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE GOVERNMENT IN

THE AMOUNT OF THESE UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS. THIS IS THE LATEST

DECISION RELATING TO LONG-RUNNING LITIGATION RESULTING FROM THE A-12 CONTRACT

TERMINATION IN 1991, AND FOLLOWS AN EARLIER TRIAL COURT DECISION IN FAVOR OF

THE CONTRACTORS AND REVERSAL OF THAT INITIAL DECISION ON APPEAL.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES, SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE TRIAL

COURT'S RULINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE UNILATERAL SCHEDULE

AND THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT ARE CONTRARY TO LAW AND FACT. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THE DECISION RAISES VALID ISSUES FOR APPEAL AND IS PURSUING ITS APPEAL.

57

58

IF, CONTRARY TO THE COMPANY'S BELIEF, THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT ON

TERMINATION WERE SUSTAINED ON APPEAL, THE COMPANY WOULD INCUR AN ADDITIONAL

LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $275 MILLION, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF REMAINING

INVENTORY COSTS AND ADJUSTMENTS. AND IF, CONTRARY TO THE COMPANY'S BELIEF, THE

APPEALS COURT FURTHER HELD THAT A MONEY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE ENTERED AGAINST THE

TEAM IN THE AMOUNT OF THE UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS, THE TEAM WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO PAY THE GOVERNMENT $1,350 MILLION PLUS STATUTORY INTEREST FROM

FEBRUARY 1991 (CURRENTLY TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $970 MILLION). UNDER THIS

OUTCOME, THE COMPANY WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO PAY ONE HALF OF THESE AMOUNTS. THE

ADDITIONAL LOSS TO THE COMPANY WOULD TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $1,430 MILLION IN

PRETAX CHARGES, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF THE REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AND THE

REMAINING INVENTORY COSTS AND ADJUSTMENTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE LOSS PROVISION ESTABLISHED BY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS

IN 1990 CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE REDUCTION

IN VALUE OF A-12 NET CONTRACTS IN PROCESS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001. FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THE A-12 LITIGATION WILL DEPEND UPON THE OUTCOME OF FURTHER

PROCEEDINGS OR POSSIBLE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

ON OCTOBER 31, 1997, A FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWSUIT WAS FILED AGAINST THE COMPANY

IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, IN SEATTLE.

THE LAWSUIT NAMES AS DEFENDANTS THE COMPANY AND THREE OF ITS THEN EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS OF A SIMILAR NATURE HAVE BEEN FILED IN THE SAME

COURT. THESE LAWSUITS WERE CONSOLIDATED ON FEBRUARY 24, 1998. THE LAWSUITS

GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS DESIRED TO KEEP THE COMPANY'S SHARE PRICE

AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE MCDONNELL DOUGLAS SHAREHOLDERS

WOULD APPROVE THE MERGER AND, IN THE CASE OF THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS, TO

BENEFIT DIRECTLY FROM THE SALE OF BOEING STOCK DURING THE PERIOD FROM

APRIL 7, 1997 THROUGH OCTOBER 22, 1997. BY ORDER DATED MAY 1, 2000, THE COURT

CERTIFIED TWO SUBCLASSES OF PLAINTIFFS IN THE ACTION: A. ALL PERSONS OR ENTITIES

WHO PURCHASED BOEING STOCK OR CALL OPTIONS OR WHO SOLD PUT OPTIONS DURING THE

PERIOD FROM JULY 21, 1997 THROUGH OCTOBER 22, 1997, AND B. ALL PERSONS OR

ENTITIES WHO PURCHASED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS STOCK ON OR AFTER APRIL 7, 1997, AND

WHO HELD SUCH STOCK UNTIL IT CONVERTED TO BOEING STOCK PURSUANT TO THE MERGER.

THE PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND TREBLE DAMAGES. ON

SEPTEMBER 17, 2001, THE COMPANY REACHED AGREEMENT WITH CLASS COUNSEL TO SETTLE

THE LAWSUIT FOR $92.5 MILLION. THE SETTLEMENT WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE

COMPANY'S EARNINGS, CASH FLOW OR FINANCIAL POSITION, AS IT IS WITHIN INSURANCE

LIMITS. THE SETTLEMENT IS CONDITIONED ON NOTICE TO THE CLASS MEMBERS AND COURT

APPROVAL, WHICH IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN 2002.

ON FEBRUARY 25, 2000, A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ALLEGING GENDER

DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT WAS FILED AGAINST THE BOEING COMPANY, BOEING

NORTH AMERICAN, INC., AND MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION. THE COMPLAINT, FILED

WITH THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE, ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY HAS

ENGAGED IN A PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT AND

RETALIATION AGAINST FEMALES OVER THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS. THE COMPLAINT, BECK

V. BOEING, NAMES 28 WOMEN WHO HAVE WORKED FOR BOEING IN THE PUGET SOUND AREA;

WICHITA, KANSAS; ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI; AND TULSA, OKLAHOMA.  ON MARCH 15, 2000,

AN AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED NAMING AN ADDITIONAL 10 PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING

THE FIRST FROM CALIFORNIA. THE LAWSUIT ATTEMPTS TO REPRESENT ALL WOMEN WHO

CURRENTLY WORK FOR THE COMPANY, OR WHO HAVE WORKED FOR THE COMPANY IN THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS.

THE COMPANY HAS DENIED THE ALLEGATION THAT IT HAS ENGAGED IN ANY UNLAWFUL

"PATTERN AND PRACTICE." PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION WAS FILED

IN MAY 2001. THE CLASS THEY SOUGHT INCLUDED SALARIED EMPLOYEES IN PUGET SOUND,

WICHITA, ST. LOUIS, AND LONG BEACH, AND HOURLY EMPLOYEES IN PUGET SOUND,

WICHITA, AND ST. LOUIS.              58

59

ON OCTOBER 19, 2001, THE COURT GRANTED CLASS CERTIFICATION TO A SEGMENT OF THE

POPULATION SOUGHT BY THE PLAINTIFFS. THE COURT RULED THAT THE ACTION COULD

PROCEED ON THE BASIS OF TWO LIMITED SUBCLASSES: A. ALL NON-EXECUTIVE SALARIED

WOMEN (INCLUDING ENGINEERS) IN THE PUGET SOUND AREA, AND B. ALL HOURLY WOMEN

COVERED BY THE MACHINISTS' BARGAINING AGREEMENT IN THE PUGET SOUND AREA. THE

CLAIMS TO BE LITIGATED ARE ALLEGED GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN COMPENSATION AND

PROMOTION. THE COURT ALSO HELD THAT THE PLAINTIFFS COULD NOT SEEK BACK PAY.

RATHER, SHOULD LIABILITY BE FOUND, THE POTENTIAL REMEDIES INCLUDE SOME FORM OF

INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AS WELL AS PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE U.S. NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF

APPEALS HAS ACCEPTED THE COMPANY'S INTERLOCUTORY APPEAL OF THE CLASS

CERTIFICATION DECISION, PARTICULARLY THE RULING THAT LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY

OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE ITS AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE OF

THESE CASES. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHAT IMPACT, IF ANY, THESE CASES

COULD HAVE ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

-------------------------------

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

THE WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR COMMERCIAL JET AIRPLANES CONTINUES TO BE PREDOMINANTLY

DRIVEN BY LONG-TERM TRENDS IN AIRLINE PASSENGER TRAFFIC. THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS

UNDERLYING LONG-TERM TRAFFIC GROWTH ARE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH, BOTH IN

DEVELOPED AND EMERGING COUNTRIES, AND POLITICAL STABILITY. DEMAND FOR THE

COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES IS FURTHER INFLUENCED BY AIRLINE INDUSTRY

PROFITABILITY, WORLD TRADE POLICIES, GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS,

ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED UPON AIRPLANE OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL

CHANGES, AND PRICE AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

AIRLINE INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT

AFTER SEVERAL YEARS OF ECONOMIC EXPANSION, THE MAJOR ECONOMIES OF THE UNITED

STATES AND EUROPE BEGAN TO SLOW IN 2001. AIR TRAVEL GROWTH SLOWED IN PARALLEL.

WORLD AIR TRAVEL GREW AT MORE THAN 7% FOR THE YEAR ENDING DECEMBER 2000. BY

AUGUST OF 2001, AIR TRAVEL GROWTH HAD DROPPED 3% OVER THE PREVIOUS 12 MONTHS.

THE INDUSTRY DOWNTURN IN THE WAKE OF THE TERRORIST ATTACKS ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001

WAS IMMEDIATE, SERIOUS AND WIDESPREAD. AIR TRAVEL TO, FROM AND WITHIN THE

UNITED STATES WAS HALTED FOR A PERIOD OF DAYS. AIR TRAVEL IN SEPTEMBER DECLINED

BY ALMOST 20% IN THE U.S. AND BY APPROXIMATELY 12% IN BOTH EUROPE AND ASIA.

AIRLINES CUT BACK THEIR ROUTES AND FREQUENCIES TO DEAL WITH THE FALL OFF IN

TRAFFIC. THE MAJOR U.S. AIRLINES REPORTED SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL LOSSES IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER AND PROFITS FOR EUROPEAN AND ASIAN AIRLINES DECLINED. RECENT

TRENDS INDICATE THAT, ABSENT AN EVENT SIMILAR TO THAT OCCURRING ON

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AIR TRAVEL GROWTH AND AIRLINE REVENUE WILL GRADUALLY

RETURN TO PRE-SEPTEMBER 11 LEVELS. AS THIS HAPPENS, AIRLINES ARE EXPECTED TO

SLOWLY EXPAND THEIR ROUTES AND FREQUENCIES AND RETURN TO PROFITABILITY.

THE COMPANY'S 20-YEAR FORECAST OF THE AVERAGE LONG-TERM GROWTH RATE IN PASSENGER

TRAFFIC IS 4.7% ANNUALLY, BASED ON PROJECTED AVERAGE WORLDWIDE ANNUAL ECONOMIC

REAL GROWTH OF 3.0%.

59

60

AIRLINE INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT (CONTINUED)

BASED ON GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH PROJECTIONS OVER THE LONG TERM, AND TAKING

INTO CONSIDERATION AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, INCREASING

UTILIZATION LEVELS OF THE WORLDWIDE AIRPLANE FLEET AND REQUIREMENTS TO

REPLACE OLDER AIRPLANES, THE COMPANY PROJECTED ALMOST A $5 TRILLION MARKET

FOR NEW AIRPLANES AND SERVICES OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS. THIS IS A LONG-TERM

FORECAST; HISTORICALLY, THE EFFECT OF EVENTS SUCH AS THE GULF WAR HAVE BEEN

RELATIVELY SHORT TERM AND, WHILE THEY HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OVER THE

SPAN OF SEVERAL YEARS, THEY HAVE NOT DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED THE LONGER TERM

TRENDS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY AND, THEREFORE, THE COMPANY'S MARKET OUTLOOK.

AIRLINE DEREGULATION

WORLDWIDE, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED PROGRESSIVE DEREGULATION OF

DOMESTIC MARKETS AND INCREASING LIBERALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO VIRTUALLY ALL AIR TRAVEL TOOK PLACE WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. SINCE THEN, AN INCREASING

NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, MOST NOTABLY THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN AND THE

COUNTRIES IN WESTERN EUROPE, HAVE ELIMINATED RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS FOR

DOMESTIC AIRLINE MARKETS AND PROMOTED A MORE OPEN-MARKET CLIMATE FOR

INTERNATIONAL SERVICES. OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS JAPAN HAVE DEREGULATED THEIR

DOMESTIC MARKETS. CURRENTLY, APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF ALL AIR TRAVEL TAKES

PLACE WITHIN AN OPEN-MARKET ENVIRONMENT. THESE TRENDS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE,

BUT AT VARYING RATES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD. BY 2010, AN ESTIMATED

TWO-THIRDS OF AIR TRAVEL WILL BE IN OPEN MARKETS. LIBERALIZATION OF GOVERNMENT

REGULATIONS, TOGETHER WITH INCREASED AIRPLANE RANGE CAPABILITIES, GIVES AIRLINES

GREATER FREEDOM TO PURSUE OPTIMAL FLEET-MIX STRATEGIES. THIS INCREASED

FLEXIBILITY ALLOWS THE AIRLINES TO ACCOMMODATE TRAFFIC GROWTH BY SELECTING THE

BEST MIX OF FLIGHT FREQUENCIES AND AIRPLANE SIZE AND CAPABILITIES FOR THEIR

ROUTE SYSTEMS. IN INTERCONTINENTAL MARKETS, MORE LIBERAL BILATERAL AIR SERVICE

AGREEMENTS PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT STIMULUS TO OPENING NEW CITY-PAIR MARKETS, WHICH

FAVOR INCREASED FLIGHT FREQUENCY OVER CAPACITY GROWTH. IN PARALLEL WITH

REGULATORY LIBERALIZATION, DEVELOPMENTS IN IMPROVING AIRPLANE RANGE PERFORMANCE

WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW AIRLINES TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF DIRECT CITY-TO-CITY

ROUTES, THUS REDUCING THE RELIANCE ON INDIRECT ROUTES THROUGH CENTRAL HUBS

THAT REQUIRE LARGER CAPACITY AIRPLANES.

MANDATED NOISE LEVEL COMPLIANCE

A MANDATE WENT INTO EFFECT JANUARY 1, 2000, REQUIRING THAT ALL OPERATIONS

INTO AND OUT OF U.S. AIRPORTS MUST BE MADE WITH STAGE 3 NOISE LEVEL COMPLIANT

AIRPLANES. A SIMILAR MANDATE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN MOST EUROPEAN AIRPORTS

IN APRIL 2002. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE POLICIES CONTINUES TO BE A FACTOR FOR NEW

AIRPLANE DELIVERIES. DURING 2001, THE INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION ORGANIZATION

(ICAO) FORMULATED NEW NOISE LEVEL STANDARDS FOR THE WORLD AIRPLANE FLEET. THE

ICAO STANDARD, REFERRED TO AS CHAPTER 4, APPLIES ONLY TO NEW AIRCRAFT TYPES.

SINCE THERE ARE NO ICAO STANDARDS THAT APPLY TO THE EXISTING WORLD FLEET, THE

EUROPEAN UNION MAY ENACT MORE STRINGENT REQUIREMENTS IN ORDER TO FORCE THE

RETIREMENT OF THE NOISIEST CHAPTER 3 AIRPLANES CURRENTLY OPERATING IN EUROPE.

THE COMPANY SUPPORTS THE MISSION OF ICAO AND ENDORSES THE CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT

OF INTERNATIONAL NOISE STANDARDS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ADOPTION OF COMMON

STANDARDS WORLDWIDE WILL PROMOTE BOTH MEANINGFUL CONTROL OF NOISE POLLUTION AND

A HEALTHY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AROUND THE WORLD.

60

61

INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS

OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS MAINTAINED, ON AVERAGE, APPROXIMATELY

A TWO-THIRDS SHARE OF THE AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL JET AIRPLANE MARKET. THE COMPANY

CURRENTLY FACES AGGRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS THAT ARE SEEKING TO

INCREASE MARKET SHARE. THIS COMPETITIVE FACTOR WAS DEMONSTRATED BY THE DECISION

OF AIRBUS TO INTRODUCE THE A380, A PROPOSED AIRCRAFT WITH PASSENGER SEATING

GREATER THAN THE 747, TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE AT THE UPPER END OF THE LARGE

AIRPLANE MARKET. THIS MARKET ENVIRONMENT HAS RESULTED IN INTENSE PRESSURES ON

PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS. THE COMPANY'S FOCUS ON IMPROVING

PROCESSES AND OTHER COST REDUCTION EFFORTS IS INTENDED TO ENHANCE ITS ABILITY

TO PURSUE PRICING STRATEGIES THAT ENABLE THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN LEADERSHIP AT

SATISFACTORY MARGINS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY'S EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT

SERVICES NETWORK FOR AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN

MAINTAINING HIGH CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. AS AN EXAMPLE, ON-LINE ACCESS IS

AVAILABLE TO ALL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS FOR ENGINEERING DRAWINGS, PARTS LISTS,

SERVICE BULLETINS AND MAINTENANCE MANUALS.

THE COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT MARKET AND THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REMAIN EXTREMELY

COMPETITIVE. COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND INCREASED LOWER-FARE PERSONAL TRAVEL

HAVE COMBINED TO CAUSE A LONG-TERM DOWNWARD TREND IN PASSENGER REVENUE YIELDS

WORLDWIDE (MEASURED IN REAL TERMS). MARKET LIBERALIZATION WITHIN EUROPE HAS

ENABLED LOW-COST AIRLINES TO ENTER THE MARKET. THESE AIRLINES INCREASE THE

DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON AIRFARES, SIMILAR TO THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE

UNITED STATES. AIRFARES BETWEEN ASIA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE AMONG THE

LOWEST YIELD (AIRFARE DIVIDED BY REVENUE PASSENGER MILES) OF ANY IN THE

WORLD. THESE FACTORS RESULT IN CONTINUED PRICE PRESSURE ON THE COMPANY'S

PRODUCTS. MAJOR PRODUCTIVITY GAINS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE A FAVORABLE MARKET

POSITION AT ACCEPTABLE PROFIT MARGINS.

IN JULY 2000, THREE MAJOR EUROPEAN AEROSPACE COMPANIES (AEROSPATIALE MATRA

OF FRANCE, DAIMLERCHRYSLER AEROSPACE OF GERMANY AND CONSTRUCCIONES AERONAUTICA

OF SPAIN) COMBINED TO FORM THE EUROPEAN AERONAUTIC DEFENCE AND SPACE COMPANY

(EADS). AS A RESULT OF THE FORMATION, EADS BECAME AN 80% OWNER OF AIRBUS

INDUSTRIE (AI) AND LED THE EFFORT FOR THE FORMATION OF THE AIRBUS INTEGRATED

COMPANY (AIC) IN EARLY 2001. THE CREATION OF THE AIC EFFECTIVELY CHANGES THE

AIRBUS ROLE, FROM THAT OF A MARKETER/DISTRIBUTOR OF LARGE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

TO ONE INCLUDING COMPLETE MANUFACTURING RESPONSIBILITY. THE AIC IS

INCORPORATED UNDER FRENCH LAW AS A PRIVATELY HELD CORPORATION OWNED 80% BY

EADS AND 20% BY BAE SYSTEMS.

OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY 51% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT SALES;

APPROXIMATELY 46% OF THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG AT

YEAR-END 2001 WAS WITH CUSTOMERS BASED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CONTINUED

ACCESS TO GLOBAL MARKETS REMAINS VITAL TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO FULLY

REALIZE ITS SALES POTENTIAL AND PROJECTED LONG-TERM INVESTMENT RETURNS.

THE IMPACT OF WORLD TRADE POLICIES

IN 1992, THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION ENTERED INTO A BILATERAL

AGREEMENT DISCIPLINING GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO AIRBUS INDUSTRIE. AMONG OTHER

THINGS, THE AGREEMENT LIMITED THE AMOUNT OF THE SUBSIDY TO NO MORE THAN 33%

OF THE TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR EACH AIRPLANE PROGRAM. IT ALSO CALLS FOR

A "PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION" IN THAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT. HOWEVER, IN 1994, MORE

THAN 130 COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ALL THE STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, SIGNED

THE SUBSIDIES AND COUNTERVAILING MEASURES (SCM) AGREEMENT AT THE WORLD TRADE

ORGANIZATION (WTO) IN GENEVA.        61

62

THE 1994 SCM AGREEMENT PROHIBITS GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO VIRTUALLY ALL

INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY WELCOMED THE

RESTRUCTURING OF AIRBUS INTO A "SINGLE CORPORATE ENTITY" ASSUMING THAT AIRBUS

COMPLIES WITH THE 1994 SCM AND RESULTS IN MORE TRANSPARENT FINANCIAL REPORTING.

THE WTO PROMOTES OPEN AND NON-DISCRIMINATORY TRADE AMONG ITS MEMBERS. AMONG

OTHER THINGS, IT ADMINISTERS AN IMPROVED SCM AGREEMENT, APPLICABLE TO ALL

MEMBERS, THAT PROVIDES IMPORTANT PROTECTIONS AGAINST INJURIOUS SUBSIDIES BY

GOVERNMENTS. IT ALSO USES IMPROVED DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES TO RESOLVE

DISAGREEMENTS AMONG NATIONS - A PROVISION NOT FOUND IN THE 1992 BILATERAL

AGREEMENT. THE 1992 BILATERAL UNITED STATES-EUROPEAN UNION AGREEMENT AND THE

LATER-IN-TIME WTO SCM CONSTITUTE THE BASIC LIMITS ON GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS

OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS. THE COMPANY TAKES THE POSITION THAT THE 1994 WTO SCM

IS THE CONTROLLING AGREEMENT.

SEE THE DISCUSSION ON PAGE 51 CONCERNING THE EUROPEAN UNION CHALLENGE THAT

HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE WTO RELATED TO U.S. FOREIGN SALES CORPORATION AND

EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME EXCLUSION TAX PROVISIONS.

GOVERNMENTS AND COMPANIES IN ASIA AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION ARE SEEKING

TO DEVELOP OR EXPAND AIRPLANE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES THROUGH

TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS WITH EACH OTHER OR CURRENT MANUFACTURERS. THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO EXPLORE WAYS TO EXPAND ITS GLOBAL PRESENCE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

SUMMARY

ALTHOUGH NEAR-TERM MARKET UNCERTAINTIES REMAIN, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO

THE RECOVERY POST SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE LONG-TERM MARKET OUTLOOK APPEARS

FAVORABLE. THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED IN ALL SEGMENTS OF THE COMMERCIAL

JET AIRPLANE MARKET, AND INTENDS TO REMAIN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY'S PREFERRED

SUPPLIER THROUGH EMPHASIS ON PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT

PROVIDE THE BEST OVERALL VALUE IN THE INDUSTRY.

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

THE COMPANY IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST PRODUCER OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND THE

SECOND LARGEST SUPPLIER TO THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE. THE COMPANY'S

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT PORTFOLIOS ARE WELL

BALANCED AMONG RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS,

CURRENT PRODUCTION AND UPGRADE ACTIVITIES, AND POST-PRODUCTION AEROSPACE

SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO EXPLORE A WIDE ARRAY OF

OPTIONS AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH AROUND THE GLOBE.

MILITARIES WORLDWIDE ARE TRANSFORMING THEIR FORCES AND CHANGING THEIR

APPROACH TO ACQUISITION. THE TRANSFORMATION IN FORCES IS EVIDENCED BY A

TREND TOWARD SMALLER, BUT MORE CAPABLE AND MORE TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED,

FORCE STRUCTURES. THE TRANSFORMATION IN ACQUISITION IS EVIDENCED BY AN

INCREASING TREND TOWARD COOPERATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

AND A DEMONSTRATED WILLINGNESS TO EXPLORE NEW FORMS OF ACQUISITION AND

OWNERSHIP INCLUDING THE LEASE OF MILITARY SUPPORT AIRCRAFT. THE COMPANY

IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED TO INTEGRATE THE CUSTOMER KNOWLEDGE, LARGE-SCALE

SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND LEAN ENTERPRISE COMPETENCIES OF ITS COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANES, MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS, AND OTHER OPERATING

SEGMENTS INTO VALUE CREATING SOLUTIONS FOR ITS MILITARY CUSTOMERS.

62

63

GENERAL ENVIRONMENT

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD), WITH OVER 40% OF THE WORLD'S

DEFENSE BUDGET, REMAINS THE PRINCIPAL CUSTOMER OF THE COMPANY'S MILITARY

AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS BUSINESS UNIT. SEVERAL TRENDS ARE EMERGING

THAT ARE SHAPING CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR IN THIS BUSINESS SEGMENT. U.S. FORCE

STRUCTURE IS SHRINKING AND AGING WHILE THE TEMPO OF ENGAGEMENTS WORLDWIDE

REMAINS HIGH. THE LATEST MILITARY ACTIVITY BY THE UNITED STATES IN

AFGHANISTAN DEMONSTRATES THE VALUE OF SYSTEMS THAT CAN COMMUNICATE WITH

EACH OTHER, CAN OPERATE OVER LONGER RANGES, ARE UNMANNED AND PROVIDE THE

ASYMMETRICAL ADVANTAGES OF PRECISION, PERSISTENCE AND SELECTIVE ENGAGEMENT.

THE WAYS IN WHICH INSTITUTIONS AND EVENTS SHAPE THE DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL

ENVIRONMENT WERE ILLUSTRATED ALMOST SIMULTANEOUSLY IN 2001. FROM AN

INSTITUTIONAL PERSPECTIVE, THE 2001 QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW (QDR),

RELEASED ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2001, IDENTIFIES NATIONAL SECURITY GOALS THAT

PROMOTE CONTINUED MODERNIZATION AND TRANSFORMATION OF THE NATION'S

MILITARY. THE POLICY GOALS ARE ASSURING ALLIES AND FRIENDS; DISSUADING

FUTURE MILITARY COMPETITION; DETERRING THREATS TO U.S. INTERESTS; AND

DEFEATING AGGRESSION IF DETERRENCE FAILS. THESE GOALS TRANSLATE INTO

CONTINUING DEMANDS FOR FORWARD PRESENCE, RAPID CONTINGENCY RESPONSE,

HOMELAND SECURITY, PEACEKEEPING, HUMANITARIAN AND DISASTER RELIEF

OPERATIONS THAT ARE DRIVING HIGH USAGE OF PERSONNEL AND EQUIPMENT THAT

RESULTS IN OPERATING COST AFFORDABILITY ISSUES. CURRENT ACQUISITION

RATES FOR AIRCRAFT, MISSILES AND SHIPS ARE WELL BELOW THE RATES NEEDED

TO RECAPITALIZE AGING EQUIPMENT WHILE THE DOD IS FACED WITH RISING

PERSONNEL, HEALTH CARE AND SUPPORT COSTS.

IN LIGHT OF AN IMMEDIATE AND A DURABLE NEED TO MAINTAIN STRONG U.S.

DEFENSE CAPABILITIES COVERING A VERY BROAD SPECTRUM OF THREATS AND

RESPONSES, NEAR-TERM DOD BUDGETS HAVE INCREASED, AND LONGER-RANGE

FORECASTS EXPECT DOD BUDGETS TO GROW FASTER THAN ANTICIPATED PRIOR TO

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. HOWEVER, WITH A SOFTENING GLOBAL ECONOMY AND

ANTICIPATED FEDERAL BUDGET TENSIONS, ALLOCATIONS TO DOD PROCUREMENT

ARE UNLIKELY TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE DOD

WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY STRATEGIES EMPHASIZING UNMANNED

AIR COMBAT AND RECONNAISSANCE VEHICLES, PRECISION GUIDED WEAPONS AND

CONTINUED PRIVATIZATION OF LOGISTICS AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES AS A MEANS TO

IMPROVE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS WHILE MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER COSTS. THE

COMPANY'S CAPABILITIES AND PROGRAMS ARE WELL SUITED TO PROVIDE THE

MILITARY CAPABILITIES ESSENTIAL TO MEET THE CHALLENGES.

THE GLOBAL COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IS CHANGING RAPIDLY AND IT IS BEST

CHARACTERIZED BY A TREND TOWARD CONSOLIDATION, ESPECIALLY IN EUROPE. THE

COMPANY FACES STRONG COMPETITION IN ALL MARKET SEGMENTS AT HOME AND ABROAD.

INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION IN THE UNITED STATES HAS RESULTED IN FOUR PRINCIPAL

PRIME CONTRACTORS FOR DEFENSE AEROSPACE SYSTEMS AND ELECTRONICS: BOEING,

LOCKHEED MARTIN, RAYTHEON AND NORTHROP GRUMMAN. GIVEN THE RELATIVELY SMALL

NUMBER OF PRIME CONTRACTORS, THESE COMPANIES OFTEN PARTNER AND SERVE AS

MAJOR SUPPLIERS TO EACH OTHER ON A VARIOUS NUMBER OF MAJOR PROGRAMS.

ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE NICHE ACQUISITIONS AND PRODUCT PORTFOLIO EXCHANGES

AT THE PRIME CONTRACTOR LEVEL, CONTINUED CONSOLIDATION IS LIKELY AMONG

SUBCONTRACTORS.

ON A GLOBAL LEVEL, THE COMPANY FACES STRONG COMPETITION FROM MAJOR EUROPEAN

CORPORATIONS. BAE SYSTEMS, WITH ITS ACQUISITIONS OF CERTAIN U.S. DEFENSE

ELECTRONICS COMPANIES, HAS POSITIONED ITSELF AS AN INCUMBENT COMPETITOR

IN THE UNITED KINGDOM AND IN THE U.S. MARKETS.

63

64

THE EUROPEAN AERONAUTICS DEFENSE & SPACE CORPORATION (EADS) IS ONE OF THE

LARGEST AIRCRAFT AND DEFENSE COMPANIES IN THE WORLD AND STANDS TO BENEFIT

DIRECTLY AS EUROPE CONTINUES TO MOVE TOWARD A COMMON DEFENSE IDENTITY AND

INDUSTRIAL POLICY. THE EMERGENCE OF MATRA BAE DYNAMICS ALENIA (MBDA) INTO A

SINGLE EUROPEAN WEAPONS PROVIDER CREATES A FORMIDABLE COMPETITOR FROM WHAT

WAS ONCE A FRAGMENTED EUROPEAN INDUSTRY. AGUSTA-WESTLAND AND EUROCOPTER

REMAIN THE PRIMARY EUROPEAN ROTORCRAFT SYSTEMS PROVIDERS FOR BOTH DEFENSE

AND COMMERCIAL AEROSPACE. IN RESPONSE TO EMERGING OPPORTUNITIES AND

COMPETITIVE PRESSURES INTERNATIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS ACTIVELY PURSUING A

GLOBALIZATION STRATEGY AIMED AT IMPROVING ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION IN MARKETS

OF INTEREST AROUND THE WORLD.

PRODUCT LINES

THE COMPANY'S MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT PRODUCES

TACTICAL FIGHTERS, TRAINERS, ROTORCRAFT, MILITARY TRANSPORTS, TANKERS,

TACTICAL MISSILES, AND SPECIAL PURPOSE AIRPLANES FOR THE UNITED STATES AND

FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, AS WELL AS AEROSPACE SUPPORT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

IN THE TRANSPORT MARKET, THIS SEGMENT IS PRODUCING 120 C-17 GLOBEMASTER

TRANSPORTS UNDER A MULTIYEAR CONTRACT WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE U.S.

AIR FORCE HAS INDICATED A NEED FOR A TOTAL OF 222 C-17S AND IS ACTIVELY

ENGAGED IN NEGOTIATING A SECOND MULTIYEAR CONTRACT. OTHER PRODUCTS IN THIS

MARKET ARE THE C-32 AND C-40 COMMERCIAL DERIVATIVE AIRCRAFT.

THE PRIMARY PRODUCTS IN THE TACTICAL AIRCRAFT MARKET INCLUDE THE F/A-18E/F

SUPER HORNET, THE F-22 RAPTOR, THE F-15 STRIKE EAGLE, AND THE AV-8B HARRIER.

THE F/A-18E/F IS THE U.S. NAVY'S PRIMARY STRIKE FIGHTER. IT IS CURRENTLY

BEING PROCURED UNDER A MULTIYEAR CONTRACT THAT EXTENDS DELIVERIES THROUGH

LATE 2006. THE COMPANY AND THE U.S. NAVY ARE ALSO LOOKING AT THIS AIRCRAFT

AS A POTENTIAL REPLACEMENT FOR THE EA-6B AIRCRAFT. THE F-22 CONTINUES TO

EXPERIENCE STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE CUSTOMER AND WAS JUST AWARDED LOT 2

PRODUCTION. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO LOOK FOR NEW MARKETS FOR THE F-15

STRIKE EAGLE AIRCRAFT AND IS ACTIVELY ENGAGED IN THE KOREAN F-X FIGHTER

COMPETITION. THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES SEGMENT IS ALSO CURRENTLY

IN THE DEVELOPMENT PHASE ON THE UNMANNED COMBAT AIR VEHICLE (UCAV) PROGRAM

FOR THE U.S. AIR FORCE AND NAVY. THE AIR FORCE VARIANT IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN

FLIGHT TEST LATER THIS YEAR. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE UCAV PROGRAMS WILL PLAY

A DEFINING ROLE IN THE FUTURE AIR COMBAT ENVIRONMENT.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS UNIQUELY POSITIONED IN THE ROTORCRAFT MARKETPLACE.

THE AH-64 APACHE IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S PRIMARY ATTACK HELICOPTER AND IS

CONSIDERED TO BE THE PREEMINENT ATTACK HELICOPTER IN THE WORLD. THE SEGMENT

IS CURRENTLY FINISHING THE FIRST DOMESTIC MULTIYEAR UPGRADE CONTRACT ON THE

APACHE AND IS TRANSITIONING TO THE SECOND MULTIYEAR CONTRACT. IN ADDITION,

THE APACHE HAS A STRONG BACKLOG OF INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS. THE CH-47 CHINOOK

IS CURRENTLY TRANSITIONING FROM DEVELOPMENT TO PRODUCTION OF A MAJOR NEW

UPGRADE PROGRAM. THIS WILL INSURE THE LONG-TERM VIABILITY OF THIS PRODUCT

LINE. WHILE THE V-22 OSPREY HAS BEEN GROUNDED DUE TO TECHNICAL CONCERNS, THE

PROGRAM CONTINUES TO HAVE GREAT CUSTOMER SUPPORT. FLIGHT TEST IS SCHEDULED TO

RESUME IN APRIL. THE COMPANY IS WORKING WITH THE CUSTOMER TO DEFINE ADDITIONAL

TESTING AND THE PRODUCTION LINE IS BEING OPTIMIZED DURING THIS TRANSITIONAL

PERIOD. LOOKING TO THE FUTURE, THE COMPANY IS TEAMED WITH SIKORSKY HELICOPTERS

IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEXT ARMED RECONNAISSANCE HELICOPTER, THE

RAH-66 COMANCHE.

64

65

CURRENT PRODUCTS IN THE TACTICAL MISSILES SEGMENT INCLUDE THE HARPOON BLOCK II,

SLAM-ER, BRIMSTONE, CALCM AND THE JOINT DIRECT ATTACK MUNITION (JDAM). THE

HIGHLY SUCCESSFUL DEPLOYMENT OF JDAM DURING RECENT ACTIONS IN AFGHANISTAN HAS

RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN BACKLOG. FUTURE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE SMALL

DIAMETER BOMB, FOR WHICH BOEING RECENTLY WON A COMPETITIVE CONCEPT DEVELOPMENT

CONTRACT. THE COMPANY ALSO IS AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING OPPORTUNITIES THAT UTILIZE

HIGH-SPEED TECHNOLOGY FOR THE NEXT-GENERATION MISSILE.

THE 767 TANKER PROGRAM DEMONSTRATES THE STRENGTH AND CAPABILITY OF THE COMPANY,

WHEN LEVERAGED ACROSS ITS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. THE PROGRAM HAS BEEN INITIATED WITH

THE RECENT ITALIAN AND JAPANESE SELECTIONS. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY IN

COMPETITION TO MEET THE TANKING REQUIREMENTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND GREAT

BRITAIN. THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES TO MARKET THE 767 TANKER TO OTHER POTENTIAL

INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS. THIS PROGRAM PROVIDES A LARGE OPPORTUNITY INTO THE NEXT

DECADE FOR THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY'S PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN THE AEROSPACE SUPPORT MARKET INCLUDES A FULL

LINE OF LIFE CYCLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT (LCCS) SUCH AS SPARES, MAINTENANCE,

MODIFICATIONS, LOGISTICS AND TRAINING. THE SEGMENT CONTINUES TO PERFORM

SUCCESSFULLY ON LCCS PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE C-17 FLEXIBLE SUSTAINMENT CONTRACT

AND THE F/A-18 FIRST CONTRACT. RECENT CONTRACT AWARDS, INCLUDING THE C-130

AVIONICS MODERNIZATION PROGRAM, HAVE SOLIDLY POSITIONED THE SEGMENT IN

THIS MARKET.

IN SUMMARY, THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT HAS A STRONG

ONGOING PRODUCTION BASE ENCOMPASSING BOTH DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS

ON PROGRAMS SUCH AS C-17, F/A-18E/F, AH-64 AND JDAM. THE SECTOR ALSO HAS SEVERAL

MAJOR PROGRAMS TRANSITIONING TO LOW-RATE INITIAL PRODUCTION SUCH AS THE F-22 AND

V-22 PROGRAMS AND IS WELL POSITIONED FOR THE FUTURE WITH DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

SUCH AS THE RAH-64, 767 TANKER, AEROSPACE SUPPORT, AND UCAV.

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

THERE ARE FOUR MAJOR MARKETS FOR THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT: LAUNCH

SERVICES, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS, HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT AND EXPLORATION,

AND MISSILE DEFENSE.

MANY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECT THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LAUNCH SERVICES BUSINESS.

THE REDUCED DEMAND PROJECTIONS THAT INCORPORATE THE RESULTS OF THE SOFTENED

NON-GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE LAUNCH MARKET AND THE RESULTING FORECAST OF EXCESS

CAPACITY IN LAUNCH VEHICLE SUPPLY WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE

ATMOSPHERE IN THE COMMERCIAL MARKET WHERE CAPABILITY, SERVICE AVAILABILITY,

RELIABILITY, AND AFFORDABILITY WILL BE CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS. THE DOD MARKET

REMAINS STEADY WITH RELIABILITY AND A GUARANTEED SECOND SOURCE BEING THE

CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS. WITH THE DELTA FAMILY AND SEA LAUNCH COMMERCIAL

LAUNCH VEHICLES, THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED TO RESPOND TO THESE CHANGING

MARKET CONDITIONS. AS THE LAUNCH MARKET CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, THE SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT IS PREPARED TO PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN NASA-DRIVEN AND

INDUSTRY-DRIVEN ADVANCED SPACE TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS.

THE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS MARKET TARGETS BOTH GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL

CUSTOMERS. THIS MARKET OFFERS THE LARGEST OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH FOR THE SPACE

AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT. THE GOVERNMENT SEGMENT INCLUDES AIRBORNE MISSION

SYSTEMS, SPACE SYSTEMS, SATELLITE SYSTEMS, AND INTEGRATED SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS

OPPORTUNITIES. THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT INCLUDES SATELLITE MANUFACTURING, NETWORK

OPERATIONS, AND APPLICATION SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES.

65

66

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS (CONTINUED)

PRODUCTS SERVING THESE MARKETS REQUIRE STRONG CUSTOMER-FOCUSED SOLUTIONS AND

SEAMLESS INTERFACES WITH MULTIPLE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES THAT ITS EXPERIENCE IN LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION PROJECTS,

ALONG WITH RELATED EXPERTISE IN SATELLITE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING

WILL PROVIDE THE LEVERAGE NECESSARY TO EXPAND IN THIS MARKET.

THE HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT AND EXPLORATION MARKET IS FORECASTED TO BE RELATIVELY

FLAT OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS. THIS FORECAST IS BASED ON BUDGET PROJECTIONS FOR

NASA, THE PRIMARY CUSTOMER IN THIS MARKET. AS NASA'S NEW ADMINISTRATION

FOCUSES ON RESOLVING THE NEAR-TERM BUDGET ISSUES, DEVELOPING A STRATEGIC

VISION, AND SETTING GOALS FOR THE AGENCY, THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED AS

NASA'S SINGLE LARGEST CONTRACTOR. SIGNIFICANT PROGRESS WAS MADE IN THE

ASSEMBLY OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS) OVER THE PAST YEAR AS IT

REACHED A MILESTONE OF ONE FULL YEAR OF CONTINUOUS HUMAN PRESENCE. NASA'S

NEAR-TERM FOCUS WILL REMAIN ON ISS, FOR WHICH THE COMPANY IS THE PRIME

CONTRACTOR. NASA AWARDED A CONTRACT TO BOEING TO SUPPORT CONTINUING OPERATIONS

AND UTILIZATION OF ISS IN DECEMBER 2001. THE SPACE SHUTTLE CONTINUES TO BE THE

ONLY U.S. VEHICLE TO SUPPORT HUMAN SPACE ACCESS, AND THE COMPANY PLAYS A KEY

ROLE IN SHUTTLE OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE THROUGH UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE, THE

COMPANY'S JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENT WITH LOCKHEED MARTIN. NASA IS EXPECTED TO

PURSUE FUTURE FUNDING FOR LONG-TERM SPACE EXPLORATION ONCE THE ISS HAS BEEN

ASSEMBLED.

FUNDING FOR THE MISSILE DEFENSE MARKET IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY U.S. GOVERNMENT

DEVELOPMENT AND PROCUREMENT BUDGETS. MARKET COMPONENTS INCLUDE NATIONAL MISSILE

DEFENSE AND THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE WEAPONS AND SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS SOLUTIONS.

THE COMPANY'S PRIME CONTRACTOR ROLE ON THE GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE

PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO DEMONSTRATE THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO PROVIDE A

SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS SOLUTION FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS

BEEN NAMED THE LEADER FOR OVERALL MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEM INTEGRATION.

ACCOMPLISHMENTS ON THE PAC-3 (PATRIOT ADVANCED CAPABILITY MISSILE) PROGRAM,

AND THE THEATER HIGH ALTITUDE AREA DEFENSE PROGRAM HAVE ESTABLISHED THE SPACE

AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT AS A MAJOR PARTICIPANT IN THE MISSILE DEFENSE MARKET.

CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING SEGMENT CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THE OPERATIONS

OF BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION (BCC), WHICH ACTS AS A CAPTIVE FINANCE SUBSIDIARY

FOR THE COMPANY. BCC PROVIDES MARKET BASED LEASE AND LOAN FINANCING PRIMARILY

TO AIRLINES WHO PURCHASE OR LEASE THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. BCC

COMPETES FOR AIRCRAFT FINANCE BUSINESS WITH OTHER FINANCE COMPANIES, COMMERCIAL

BANKS, AND OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

BCC ALSO COMPETES IN THE COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT LEASING AND FINANCE MARKETS,

PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED STATES, AGAINST A NUMBER OF LARGER AND MANY SMALLER

COMPETITORS, INCLUDING OTHER LEASING COMPANIES AND FINANCING INSTITUTIONS.

APPROXIMATELY 30% OF BCC'S BUSINESS COMES FROM THIS MARKET. THE TYPE OF

EQUIPMENT LEASED INCLUDES CORPORATE AIRCRAFT, MACHINE TOOLS, OCEAN-GOING

VESSELS, AND PRODUCTION FACILITIES. LEASING ACCOUNTS FOR APPROXIMATELY 30% OF

DOMESTIC CAPITAL EXPENDITURES WHICH ARE EXPECTED TO GROW CONSISTENTLY AT AN

ANNUAL RATE OF APPROXIMATELY 8%. NEW BUSINESS VOLUME OF BCC IS FUNDED WITH

DEBT OBTAINED IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS TO WHICH IT HAS ACCESS AS WELL AS CASH

FROM OPERATIONS AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM ITS PARENT COMPANY.

66

67

VALUE CREATION

--------------

NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE CURRENT AIRCRAFT

MODELS, AND ASSESSES THE MARKETPLACE TO ENSURE THAT ITS FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL

JET AIRCRAFT IS WELL POSITIONED TO MEET FUTURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AIRLINE

INDUSTRY. THE FUNDAMENTAL STRATEGY IS TO MAINTAIN A BROAD PRODUCT LINE THAT IS

RESPONSIVE TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS BY MAXIMIZING COMMONALITY AMONG THE

BOEING FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS DETERMINED

TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BY OFFERING PRODUCTS

WITH THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF QUALITY, SAFETY, TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE, ECONOMIC

PERFORMANCE AND IN-SERVICE SUPPORT.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DELTA IV EXPENDABLE

LAUNCH VEHICLE. THE SEA LAUNCH JOINT VENTURE OFFERS AUTOMATED COMMERCIAL

SATELLITE LAUNCHES FROM A SEAGOING LAUNCH PLATFORM. THESE PRODUCTS GIVE

THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT GREATER ACCESS TO A PORTION OF THE LAUNCH

MARKET THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY UNAVAILABLE WITH THE DELTA II ROCKET ALONE. THE

COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES TO INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AIRBORNE EARLY

WARNING & CONTROL SYSTEMS PLATFORM. THESE INVESTMENTS WILL ALSO PROVIDE

LEVERAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION AND BATTLE

MANAGEMENT APPLICATIONS.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO INVESTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 767 TANKER PROGRAM.

THIS PROGRAM REPRESENTS A LARGE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE STATE OF THE ART

TANKING CAPABILITIES TO OUR POTENTIAL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS.

IT DEMONSTRATES THE SYNERGISTIC VALUE OF THE DIVERSIFIED BOEING PORTFOLIO IN

PROVIDING BEST VALUE SOLUTIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS.

MAJOR PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS

THE COMPANY REMAINS STRONGLY COMMITTED TO BECOMING A WORLD-CLASS LEADER IN

ALL ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS AND TO MAINTAINING A STRONG FOCUS ON CUSTOMER

NEEDS, INCLUDING PRODUCT CAPABILITIES, TECHNOLOGY, IN-SERVICE ECONOMICS AND

PRODUCT SUPPORT. MAJOR LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY GAINS ARE BEING AGGRESSIVELY

PURSUED, WITH RESOURCES INVESTED IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING, RESTRUCTURING OF

PROCESSES, NEW TECHNOLOGY, AND ORGANIZATIONAL REALIGNMENT. RECENT COMMERCIAL

AND GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE 767-400ER, 737-900 AND

JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER, INCLUDED EARLY COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES FOR INTEGRATED

PRODUCT TEAMS, DESIGN INTERFACE WITH CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVES, USE OF

ADVANCED THREE-DIMENSIONAL DIGITAL PRODUCT DEFINITION AND DIGITAL

PRE-ASSEMBLY COMPUTER APPLICATIONS, AND INCREASED USE OF AUTOMATED

MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH THESE MEASURES HAVE REQUIRED SIGNIFICANT

CURRENT INVESTMENTS, SUBSTANTIAL LONG-TERM BENEFITS ARE ANTICIPATED FROM

REDUCTIONS IN DESIGN CHANGES AND REWORK AND IMPROVED QUALITY OF INTERNALLY

MANUFACTURED AND SUPPLIER PARTS. SIGNIFICANT INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE

PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES ARE UNDERWAY. EFFORTS TO STREAMLINE

CONFIGURATION, ORDERING AND SHOP FLOOR SYSTEMS CONTINUE. MANY OF THE LEAN

MANUFACTURING CONCEPTS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE ENTERPRISE. EFFORTS

ARE UNDERWAY ON PART NUMBER REDUCTION, CYCLE TIME REDUCTION AND MAXIMIZING

THE VALUE OF AIRPLANE CHANGE. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT

STRIDES IN CONTINUING THE IMPLEMENTATION OF MOVING PRODUCTION LINES BY

IMPLEMENTING THE PRACTICE IN THE 737 AND 747 FINAL ASSEMBLY.

67

68

THE INITIATIVES WILL ENHANCE THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO ENSURE STANDARDIZATION

WHERE IT BENEFITS CUSTOMERS, PROVIDE "JUST IN TIME" FEATURE SELECTION, AND

ALLOW FOR MORE PREDICTABLE, STABLE AND SHORTER PRODUCTION FLOWS. THESE

INITIATIVES WILL IMPROVE OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCIES AND PROVIDE BETTER CUSTOMER

PRODUCT SELECTION.

THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT AND THE SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT CONTINUE TO AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE IMPORTANT PROCESS

IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH INTEGRATED PRODUCT TEAMS THAT PROVIDE COST-EFFECTIVE

SOLUTIONS AND MAINTAIN TECHNOLOGICAL SUPERIORITY. PHANTOM WORKS, THE

ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION OF BOEING, FOCUSES ON

IMPROVING THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE POSITION THROUGH INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES,

IMPROVED PROCESSES AND THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY IS

CONTINUING TO ASSESS POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR IMPROVED USE AND

CONSOLIDATION OF FACILITIES ACROSS ALL PARTS OF THE COMPANY AND TO FOCUS ON

THOSE CAPABILITIES AND PROCESSES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CORE COMPETENCIES

RESULTING IN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. FUTURE DECISIONS REGARDING FACILITIES

CONVERSIONS OR CONSOLIDATIONS WILL BE BASED ON LONG-TERM BUSINESS OBJECTIVES.

WITHIN THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS AND SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

SEGMENTS, MAJOR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS WILL BE CONTINGENT ON DEMONSTRATION OF

COST SAVINGS FOR U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY IS PURSUING THE MEANS TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE NEW PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT COST AND FLOW TIME. INITIATIVES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THIS

EFFORT INCLUDE THE FORMATION OF THE CREATION CENTER, WHICH IS TIED CLOSELY

WITH PHANTOM WORKS, AND OTHER COMPARABLE EFFORTS. ANOTHER INITIATIVE IS THE

MIGRATION TO PLATFORMS AND PLATFORM TEAMS MODELED AFTER PREMIER BENCHMARKED

COMPANIES. OTHER INITIATIVES INCLUDE DESIGN TOOL AUTOMATION INTEGRATED

WITH MANUFACTURING, IMPROVED LOADS MODELS, AND DECISION SUPPORT METHODOLOGIES.

THE COMPANY USES ENTERPRISE PROCESS COUNCILS AS THE STRUCTURE FOR REALIZING

SYNERGIES COMPANY-WIDE. THESE COUNCILS ARE MADE UP OF THE LEADERS OF KEY

PROCESSES FROM EACH OF THE OPERATING GROUPS, AS WELL AS PHANTOM WORKS, AND

RAPIDLY SHARES BEST PRACTICES AND COMBINES EFFORTS TO MEET NEEDS ACROSS THE

COMPANY. ENTERPRISE PROCESS COUNCILS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR DEFINE,

MANUFACTURING, FINANCE, QUALITY AND PROCUREMENT PROCESSES.

SHAREHOLDER VALUE AS A CORPORATE PERFORMANCE MEASURE

----------------------------------------------------

MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A GOOD BALANCE

BETWEEN SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM MEASURES AND FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL

MEASURES TO ALIGN ALL DECISION PROCESSES AND OPERATING OBJECTIVES TO

INCREASE SHAREHOLDER VALUE OVER THE LONG TERM.

IN 1999, THE COMPANY INITIATED A MANAGING FOR VALUE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO

DEVELOP A COMPANY-WIDE CULTURE TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

AND GROWTH. CONSISTENT WITH THESE OBJECTIVES, THE COMPANY HAS SET PERFORMANCE

TARGETS BASED ON ECONOMIC PROFIT GOALS. ECONOMIC PROFIT, WHICH IS CALCULATED

BY SUBTRACTING A CAPITAL CHARGE FROM THE COMPANY'S NET OPERATING PROFIT AFTER

TAXES, IS THE METRIC USED TO MEASURE OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. AWARDS TO

EXECUTIVES UNDER THE COMPANY'S INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN ARE BASED ON THE

ACHIEVEMENT OF ECONOMIC PROFIT TARGETS. EFFECTIVE FOR 2000, THE COMPANY

INITIATED AN INCENTIVE PLAN THAT PROVIDES ANNUAL CASH REWARDS TO NON-UNION,

NON-EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEES UPON ACHIEVING ANNUAL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE

OBJECTIVES BASED ON ECONOMIC PROFIT.

68

69

THE COMPANY HAS IMPLEMENTED AN EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION PROGRAM WHEREBY RIGHTS

TO RECEIVE STOCK, REFERRED TO AS PERFORMANCE SHARES, HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO PLAN

PARTICIPANTS. AN INCREASING PORTION OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED WILL BE

CONVERTIBLE TO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AS THE STOCK PRICE REACHES AND MAINTAINS

CERTAIN THRESHOLD LEVELS. THESE THRESHOLD STOCK PRICE LEVELS REPRESENT

PREDETERMINED COMPOUND FIVE-YEAR GROWTH RATES RELATIVE TO THE STOCK PRICE AT

THE TIME THE PERFORMANCE SHARES ARE GRANTED. DURING 2000, PORTIONS OF THE

PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED IN 1999 AND 2000 WERE CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK.

ANY PERFORMANCE SHARES NOT CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK AFTER FIVE YEARS FROM DATE

OF GRANT WILL EXPIRE. THIS PLAN IS INTENDED TO INCREASE EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT'S

FOCUS ON IMPROVING SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

THE BOEING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, 2000 AND 1999

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

NOTE 1

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

------------------------------------------

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE BOEING COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH

ITS SUBSIDIARIES (HEREIN REFERRED TO AS THE "COMPANY") INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS

OF ALL MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES FOR WHICH

THE COMPANY DOES NOT HAVE CONTROL, BUT HAS THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE OVER THE OPERATING AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER

THE EQUITY METHOD. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF NET EARNINGS AND LOSSES

FROM THESE VENTURES IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

INTERCOMPANY PROFITS, TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN

CONSOLIDATION. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO PRIOR PERIODS

TO CONFORM WITH CURRENT REPORTING.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND

ESTIMATES THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES FOR WHICH CHANGES IN THE NEAR

TERM ARE CONSIDERED REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THESE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT SALES ARE RECORDED AS DELIVERIES ARE MADE UNLESS

TRANSFER OF RISK AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP IS NOT SUFFICIENT.

SALES UNDER FIXED-PRICE-TYPE CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS

DELIVERIES ARE MADE OR AT THE COMPLETION OF SCHEDULED PERFORMANCE MILESTONES.

FOR CERTAIN FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE OVER

AN EXTENDED PERIOD BEFORE DELIVERIES BEGIN, SALES ARE RECORDED BASED UPON

ATTAINMENT OF EITHER INTERNALLY IDENTIFIED OR EXTERNAL PERFORMANCE MILESTONES.

SALES UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS ARE RECORDED AS COSTS ARE

INCURRED. CERTAIN CONTRACTS CONTAIN PROFIT INCENTIVES BASED UPON PERFORMANCE

RELATIVE TO PREDETERMINED TARGETS THAT MAY OCCUR DURING OR SUBSEQUENT TO

DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCT. INCENTIVES, OF WHICH AMOUNTS CAN BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED, ARE RECORDED OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD OF THE CONTRACT.

INCENTIVES AND FEE AWARDS, OF WHICH AMOUNTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED,

ARE RECORDED WHEN AWARDED. CERTAIN CONTRACTS CONTAIN PROVISIONS FOR

THE REDETERMINATION OF PRICE BASED UPON FUTURE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH CUSTOMER FINANCING ACTIVITIES IS INCLUDED IN SALES

AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES.

70

71

CONTRACT AND PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

IN THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT AND SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT, OPERATIONS PRINCIPALLY CONSIST OF PERFORMING WORK

UNDER CONTRACT, PREDOMINANTLY FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN

GOVERNMENTS. COST OF SALES FOR SUCH CONTRACTS IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE

ESTIMATED AVERAGE TOTAL CONTRACT COST AND REVENUE. ESTIMATES OF EACH

CONTRACT'S REVENUE AND COST ARE REVIEWED AND REASSESSED QUARTERLY. CHANGES

IN ESTIMATES RESULT IN CUMULATIVE REVISIONS TO THE CONTRACT PROFIT

RECOGNIZED.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS ARE PLANNED, COMMITTED AND FACILITIZED BASED

ON LONG-TERM DELIVERY FORECASTS, NORMALLY FOR QUANTITIES IN EXCESS OF

CONTRACTUALLY FIRM ORDERS. COST OF SALES FOR THE 717, 737, 747, 757, 767

AND 777 COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS IS DETERMINED UNDER THE PROGRAM METHOD

OF ACCOUNTING BASED ON ESTIMATED AVERAGE TOTAL COST AND REVENUE FOR THE

CURRENT PROGRAM QUANTITY. THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING EFFECTIVELY

AVERAGES TOOLING AND SPECIAL EQUIPMENT COSTS, AS WELL AS UNIT PRODUCTION

COSTS, OVER THE PROGRAM QUANTITY. BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION

COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW PROGRAM AND THE SUBSTANTIAL

INVESTMENT REQUIRED FOR INITIAL TOOLING AND SPECIAL EQUIPMENT, NEW

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS NORMALLY HAVE LOWER OPERATING PROFIT

MARGINS THAN ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS. IN 2001, THE INITIAL PROGRAM QUANTITY

FOR THE 717 PROGRAM WAS REVISED FROM 200 TO 135 UNITS. THE ESTIMATED

PROGRAM AVERAGE COSTS AND REVENUES ARE REVIEWED AND REASSESSED QUARTERLY,

AND CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE RECOGNIZED OVER CURRENT AND FUTURE DELIVERIES

CONSTITUTING THE PROGRAM QUANTITY.

TO THE EXTENT THAT INVENTORIABLE COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO EXCEED THE TOTAL

ESTIMATED SALES PRICE, CHARGES ARE MADE TO CURRENT EARNINGS TO REDUCE

INVENTORIED COSTS TO ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIED COSTS ON COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTS

INCLUDE DIRECT ENGINEERING, PRODUCTION AND TOOLING COSTS, AND APPLICABLE

OVERHEAD, NOT IN EXCESS OF ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE. IN ACCORDANCE

WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, INVENTORIED COSTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS RELATING TO

PROGRAMS AND CONTRACTS WITH LONG PRODUCTION CYCLES, A PORTION OF WHICH

IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED WITHIN ONE YEAR. COMMERCIAL SPARE PARTS AND

GENERAL STOCK MATERIALS ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST NOT IN EXCESS OF NET

REALIZABLE VALUE.

SHARE-BASED PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE EXPENSE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 123, "ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION." THE COMPANY VALUES STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED BASED UPON AN

OPTION-PRICING MODEL AND RECOGNIZES THIS VALUE AS AN EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD

IN WHICH THE OPTIONS VEST. POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION FROM THE SHAREVALUE TRUST

DESCRIBED IN NOTE 22 HAVE BEEN VALUED BASED UPON AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL,

WITH THE RELATED EXPENSE RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRUST. SHARE-BASED

EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMANCE SHARES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 22 IS DETERMINED

BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT THE TIME OF THE AWARD

APPLIED TO THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES CONTINGENTLY ISSUABLE BASED ON STOCK

PRICE AND IS AMORTIZED OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.

71

72

INTEREST EXPENSE

INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE IS PRESENTED NET OF AMOUNTS CAPITALIZED. INTEREST

EXPENSE IS SUBJECT TO CAPITALIZATION AS A CONSTRUCTION-PERIOD COST OF PROPERTY,

PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND OF COMMERCIAL PROGRAM TOOLING.

INCOME TAXES

FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES ARE COMPUTED AT CURRENT TAX RATES,

LESS TAX CREDITS. TAXES ARE ADJUSTED BOTH FOR ITEMS THAT DO NOT HAVE TAX

CONSEQUENCES AND FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ANY CHANGES IN TAX RATES FROM

THOSE PREVIOUSLY USED TO DETERMINE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. TAX

PROVISIONS INCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PAYABLE, PLUS CHANGES IN

DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARISE BECAUSE OF TEMPORARY

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE TIME WHEN ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE RECOGNIZED

FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING AND INCOME TAX PURPOSES.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

THE COMPANY'S FUNDING POLICY FOR PENSION PLANS IS TO CONTRIBUTE, AT A MINIMUM,

THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED AMOUNT TO AN IRREVOCABLE TRUST. BENEFITS UNDER THE

PLANS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AGE AT RETIREMENT, THE EMPLOYEE'S ANNUAL EARNINGS

INDEXED AT THE U.S. TREASURY 30-YEAR BOND RATE, AND YEARS OF SERVICE. THE

ACTUARIAL COST METHOD USED IN DETERMINING THE NET PERIODIC PENSION COST IS THE

PROJECTED UNIT CREDIT METHOD.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF HIGHLY LIQUID INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS

CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, TIME DEPOSITS, TREASURY NOTES AND OTHER MONEY MARKET

INSTRUMENTS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE MATURITIES OF LESS THAN THREE MONTHS.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES

THE COMPANY HOLDS CERTAIN INVESTMENTS THAT ARE TREATED AS "AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE"

SECURITIES UNDER SFAS NO. 115, "ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND

EQUITY SECURITIES." THESE INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS 'OTHER ASSETS' ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION, AT THEIR QUOTED MARKET VALUES.

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED AS PART OF 'ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME' ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION.

REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

OPERATIONS, IN THE LINE ITEM 'OTHER INCOME, PRINCIPALLY INTEREST.'

HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES

HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES, CLASSIFIED AS 'OTHER ASSETS' ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION, INCLUDE BOND NOTES, ENHANCED EQUIPMENT TRUST

CERTIFICATES AND DEBENTURES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS THE POSITIVE INTENT AND

ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY ARE REPORTED AT AMORTIZED COST.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST, INCLUDING APPLICABLE

CONSTRUCTION-PERIOD INTEREST, AND DEPRECIATED PRINCIPALLY OVER THE FOLLOWING

ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES: NEW BUILDINGS AND LAND IMPROVEMENTS, FROM 20 TO 45

YEARS; AND MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, FROM 3 TO 13 YEARS.

72

73

THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF DEPRECIATION ARE AS FOLLOWS: BUILDINGS AND LAND

IMPROVEMENTS, 150% DECLINING BALANCE; AND MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT,

SUM-OF-THE-YEARS' DIGITS. THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE

APPROPRIATENESS OF REMAINING DEPRECIABLE LIVES ASSIGNED TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS

SUBJECT TO A MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR DISPOSITION.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS DEEMED AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST

OR FAIR VALUE. LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR USE ARE SUBJECT TO AN IMPAIRMENT

ADJUSTMENT DOWN TO FAIR VALUE IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS NO LONGER RECOVERABLE

BASED UPON THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS.

GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

GOODWILL, REPRESENTING THE EXCESS OF ACQUISITION COSTS OVER THE FAIR VALUE

OF NET ASSETS OF BUSINESSES PURCHASED, IS AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD

OVER 20 TO 30 YEARS. RECOVERABILITY OF THE UNAMORTIZED GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED

INTANGIBLES BALANCE IS PRIMARILY BASED UPON ASSESSMENT OF RELATED OPERATIONAL

CASH FLOWS. SEE NOTE 5 FOR A DISCUSSION ON THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO.142,

"GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS."

ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED LIVES, AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE

METHOD, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES, 5 TO 20 YEARS; TRADENAME,

20 YEARS; DATA REPOSITORIES, 15 TO 20 YEARS; ASSEMBLED WORKFORCE, 5 TO 15 YEARS;

PRODUCT KNOW-HOW, 15 TO 20 YEARS; AND CUSTOMER LISTS, 5 TO 15 YEARS.

DERIVATIVES

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR DERIVATIVES PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 133, "ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES," AS AMENDED. THIS STANDARD

REQUIRES THAT ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE REGARDLESS OF THE PURPOSE OR INTENT FOR

HOLDING THEM. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE EITHER

RECOGNIZED PERIODICALLY IN INCOME OR SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (AS A COMPONENT OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME), DEPENDING ON THEIR USE AND DESIGNATION

THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 133 IN 2001 RESULTED IN A TRANSITION GAIN OF $1 ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS SHOWN UNDER THE CAPTION 'CUMULATIVE

EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE, NET,' AND A NET LOSS OF $18 ($11 NET OF TAX)

RECORDED TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

AIRCRAFT VALUATION

AIRCRAFT DEEMED AVAILABLE FOR SALE, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORY, ARE

STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY REVIEWS ITS USED

AIRCRAFT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS RELATIVE TO THE AIRCRAFT'S ANTICIPATED

FAIR VALUE, AND RECORDS ANY DEFICIENCY AS A CHARGE TO EARNINGS. FAIR VALUE

IS DETERMINED BY USING BOTH INTERNAL AND EXTERNAL AIRCRAFT VALUATIONS,

INCLUDING INFORMATION DEVELOPED FROM THE SALE OF SIMILAR AIRCRAFT IN THE

SECONDARY MARKET. AIRCRAFT ON OPERATING LEASE OR HELD FOR OPERATING LEASE

ARE CLASSIFIED WITH CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING ASSETS. THE COMPANY

REVIEWS THESE OPERATING LEASE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY OR WHEN EVENTS

OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF THESE ASSETS MAY NOT

BE RECOVERABLE. AN ASSET IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW, BASED ON MARKET ASSESSMENT OF LEASE RATES, OVER THE REMAINING

USEFUL LIFE IS LESS THAN THE NET BOOK VALUE. WHEN IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR

AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS THE EXCESS OF NET BOOK VALUE OVER

FAIR VALUE.

73

74

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS UNDER SFAS NO. 112,

"EMPLOYER'S ACCOUNTING FOR POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS." A LIABILITY FOR

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IS RECORDED WHEN TERMINATION IS PROBABLE AND THE

AMOUNT IS ESTIMABLE.

NOTE 2

REVENUES AND COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO FINANCING ACTIVITIES

-------------------------------------------------------

THE YEARS 2001, 2000 AND 1999 INCLUDE SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES OF

$1,036, $803 AND $686 AND COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OF $395, $259 AND $218,

RESPECTIVELY, ATTRIBUTABLE TO FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY ACCOUNTED FOR IN

THE CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING SEGMENT. FINANCING ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY

RELATE TO THE FINANCING OF COMMERCIAL AND PRIVATE AIRCRAFT AND COMMERCIAL

EQUIPMENT. REVENUES INCLUDE INTEREST ON NOTES RECEIVABLE AND SALES-TYPE LEASES

AND LEASE INCOME FROM OPERATING LEASES. COSTS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDES

DEPRECIATION ON LEASED AIRCRAFT AND EQUIPMENT AND VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS OF

CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING ASSETS.

NOTE 3

GAIN ON DISPOSITIONS, NET

-------------------------

GAINS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE SALE OF BUSINESSES, ALONG WITH GAINS AND

LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE DISPOSITION OF REAL PROPERTY, ARE REPORTED ON A NET

BASIS IN THE CAPTION 'GAIN ON DISPOSITIONS, NET' ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. NET GAINS OF $19, $17 AND $118 WERE RECORDED FOR

SALES OF BUSINESSES IN 2001, 2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 4

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPACT OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS

---------------------------------------------------------------------

ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE UNITED STATES WAS THE TARGET OF SEVERE TERRORIST

ATTACKS THAT INVOLVED THE USE OF U.S. COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURED BY THE

COMPANY. THESE ATTACKS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY AND

CAUSED MAJOR DISRUPTIONS IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND IN THE U.S. ECONOMY OVERALL.

TO ADDRESS THE WIDESPREAD FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE ATTACKS, THE EMERGING ISSUES

TASK FORCE (EITF) RELEASED ISSUE NO. 01-10, "ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPACT OF

TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001." THIS ISSUE SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS

TREATING COSTS AND LOSSES RESULTING FROM THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AS

EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS; HOWEVER, IT OBSERVES THAT ANY PORTION OF THESE COSTS AND

LOSSES DEEMED TO BE UNUSUAL OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING SHOULD BE PRESENTED AS A

SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $935 IN

THE CAPTION 'SPECIAL CHARGES DUE TO EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.' THIS CHARGE

RELATED TO THE CATEGORIES LISTED BELOW. OF THIS CHARGE, $908 IS RELATED TO THE

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT AND $27 IS RELATED TO THE OTHER SEGMENT.

EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE

THE COMPANY INCURRED AND IS EXPECTED TO INCUR EMPLOYMENT REDUCTIONS RESULTING

FROM THE DECREASE IN AIRCRAFT DEMAND, WHICH DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ATTACKS OF

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED

A CHARGE OF $287 ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE ASSOCIATED EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE OBLIGATIONS.

74

75

717 FORWARD LOSS

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001, THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY OF THE 717 PROGRAM WAS

REVISED TO 135 UNITS FROM 200 UNITS. THIS REVISION RESULTED FROM A LACK OF FIRM

DEMAND FOR THE 717 AIRCRAFT SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AND THE

UNCERTAINTY IN ESTIMATING FUTURE REVENUES AND COSTS FOR 200 UNITS BASED UPON THE

REVISED PROJECTED DELIVERY SCHEDULE. THE FORWARD LOSS OF $250 REPRESENTS THE

AMOUNT BY WHICH, AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE INVENTORY BALANCE PLUS ESTIMATED

FUTURE INVENTORY COSTS EXCEEDS THE ESTIMATED REVENUE FOR THE UNDELIVERED

AIRCRAFT WITHIN THE REVISED ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE

COMPANY CUMULATIVELY DELIVERED 93 717 PROGRAM AIRCRAFT. THE ESTIMATES FOR THE

REVISED ACCOUNTING QUANTITY ASSUME THAT THE 717 WILL REMAIN AN ONGOING PROGRAM.

ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO PLANS TO DO SO, IF THE PROGRAM WERE TO BE TERMINATED

AFTER THE DELIVERY OF 135 UNITS, THE COMPANY WOULD BE EXPOSED TO POTENTIALLY

MATERIAL TERMINATION COSTS.

USED AIRCRAFT VALUATION

THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE

MARKET VALUE OF USED AIRCRAFT. THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $185 RELATING TO

THE DECREASE IN MARKET VALUE FOR AIRCRAFT HELD FOR RESALE AS WELL AS ASSET

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO TRADE-IN OF USED AIRCRAFT.

INVENTORY VALUATION

THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $96 RELATING TO EXCESS AND OBSOLETE COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANE SPARES INVENTORY. SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, COMMERCIAL AIRLINE

CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE REMOVED A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT FROM SERVICE. THE

ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF FUTURE SALES FOR SPECIFIC SPARE PARTS HELD IN INVENTORY

IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ACTIVE AIRCRAFT FLEET IN WHICH THAT SPARE PART

SUPPORTS. THE REVISED PROJECTIONS FOR FUTURE DEMAND OF CERTAIN SPARE PARTS

INDICATE THAT CURRENT INVENTORY QUANTITIES ARE IN EXCESS OF TOTAL EXPECTED

FUTURE DEMAND.

VENDOR PENALTIES

THE DECREASE IN PRODUCTION RATES ON CERTAIN COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE MODELS AND

RELATED PRODUCTS TRIGGERED CONTRACTUAL PENALTY CLAUSES WITH VARIOUS VENDORS AND

SUBCONTRACTORS, AND THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $68 FOR THESE PENALTIES.

THE DECREASE IN PRODUCTION RATES RESULTED DIRECTLY FROM THE CHANGE IN AIRCRAFT

DEMAND AFTER THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.

GUARANTEE COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS EXTENDED CERTAIN GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS SUCH AS ASSET VALUE

GUARANTEES DISCUSSED IN NOTE 24. BASED UPON THE IMPACT OF THE EVENTS OF

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, ON AIRCRAFT MARKET PRICES AND AIRCRAFT DEMAND OF CUSTOMERS

WHO ARE COUNTERPARTIES IN THESE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $49

ASSOCIATED WITH AN ADVERSE EXPOSURE UNDER THESE GUARANTEES.

ONGOING ASSESSMENT

THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE TO ASSESS OTHER POTENTIAL LOSSES AND COSTS IT MIGHT

INCUR IN RELATION TO THE ATTACKS. THESE FUTURE COSTS ARE NOT YET ACCRUABLE;

HOWEVER, THE COMPANY EXPECTS THAT SUCH COSTS MAY BE INCURRED THROUGHOUT 2002.

LIABILITIES TOTALING $542 WERE ESTABLISHED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, ASSOCIATED

WITH THESE CHARGES AND ARE EXPECTED TO BE SETTLED BY THE END OF 2002. ANY COSTS

OR ADJUSTMENTS IN ESTIMATES WILL CONTINUE TO BE RECOGNIZED AS A SEPARATE

COMPONENT OF EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS ENTITLED 'SPECIAL CHARGES DUE TO EVENTS

OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.'

75

76

NOTE 5

STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

----------------------------------------

IN JUNE 2001, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED STATEMENT

OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 141, "BUSINESS COMBINATIONS," AND

SFAS NO. 142, "GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS." THE COMPANY IS REQUIRED

TO ADOPT SFAS NO. 141 FOR ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS COMPLETED AFTER

JUNE 30, 2001. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES THAT BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER

JUNE 30, 2001, BE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD. GOODWILL AND OTHER

INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT RESULTED FROM BUSINESS COMBINATIONS BEFORE JULY 1, 2001,

MUST BE RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS NO. 142, AS OF THE

STATEMENT ADOPTION DATE.

THE COMPANY WILL ADOPT SFAS NO. 142 AT THE BEGINNING OF 2002 FOR ALL GOODWILL

AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANY'S STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

POSITION AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002. THIS STANDARD CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING FOR

GOODWILL FROM AN AMORTIZATION METHOD TO AN IMPAIRMENT-ONLY APPROACH, AND

INTRODUCES A NEW MODEL FOR DETERMINING IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

THE NEW IMPAIRMENT MODEL REQUIRES PERFORMANCE OF A TWO-STEP TEST FOR OPERATIONS

THAT HAVE GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO THEM. FIRST, IT REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF THE BOOK

VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS. FAIR VALUES ARE

ESTIMATED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, SUBJECT TO ADJUSTMENT BASED ON THE

COMPANY'S MARKET CAPITALIZATION AT THE DATE OF EVALUATION. IF FAIR VALUE IS

DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN BOOK VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE

AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT. IN THIS PROCESS, THE FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL IS ESTIMATED,

AND IS COMPARED TO ITS BOOK VALUE. ANY SHORTFALL OF THE BOOK VALUE BELOW FAIR

VALUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.

UPON TRANSITION TO THE NEW IMPAIRMENT MODEL AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002, THE COMPANY

PROJECTS THAT IT WILL RECOGNIZE A REDUCTION OF GOODWILL AND A PRETAX CHARGE IN

THE RANGE OF $2,100 TO $2,600, IDENTIFIED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF AN

ACCOUNTING CHANGE. THIS CHARGE RESULTS FROM THE CHANGE FROM THE PRIOR

IMPAIRMENT METHOD, WHOSE FIRST STEP WAS BASED ON UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS, TO THE

NEW ONE THAT IS BASED ON FAIR VALUE. THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT WILL REFLECT THE

ESTIMATES AND EXPECTATIONS OF THE MARKETPLACE PARTICIPANTS AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2002, THE DATE OF ADOPTION.

IN JUNE 2001, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 143, "ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT

OBLIGATIONS," AND IN AUGUST 2001, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 144, "ACCOUNTING FOR

THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS." THE COMPANY DOES NOT BELIEVE

THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THESE STANDARDS WILL HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOTE 6

ACQUISITIONS

------------

ON OCTOBER 6, 2000, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED THE HUGHES ELECTRONICS CORPORATION

(HUGHES) SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS AND RELATED BUSINESSES. THE ACQUISITION WAS

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE METHOD, BY WHICH THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS

ALLOCATED TO THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED BASED ON PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES OF THEIR

FAIR VALUES. THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE WAS $3,849, INITIAL GOODWILL WAS VALUED

AT $740 AND THE OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE VALUED AT $631. DURING THE PERIOD

FROM ACQUISITION TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2001, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS

ASSESSMENT OF THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED AND GOODWILL WAS INCREASED TO A BALANCE OF

$2,166.

76

77

INCLUDED IN GOODWILL ARE CERTAIN CLAIMS SUBMITTED TO HUGHES FOR RESOLUTION AS

CONTRACTUAL PURCHASE PRICE CONTINGENCIES. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES FINALIZING

THE HUGHES PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION DURING LATE 2002 OR EARLY 2003, AT THE

CONCLUSION OF ARBITRATION PROCEDURES RELATED TO THESE CONTINGENCIES. OTHER

ADJUSTMENTS WERE RECORDED TO REFLECT FINALIZATION OF FAIR VALUE ASSESSMENTS

FOR THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED AND THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANY'S ACCOUNTING

POLICIES ON ACQUIRED BALANCES.

OTHER ACQUISITIONS IN 2000 INCLUDED JEPPESEN SANDERSON, INC. ON OCTOBER 4, 2000,

FOR $1,524 IN CASH, CONTINENTAL GRAPHICS CORP. ON SEPTEMBER 1, 2000, FOR $183 IN

CASH, AND AUTOMETRIC, INC. ON AUGUST 2, 2000, FOR $119 IN CASH.

THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S SIGNIFICANT ACQUISITIONS IN 2000

ALONG WITH THE PURCHASE PRICE AND THE ALLOCATION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE TO

IPR&D; AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

THE FAIR VALUE AMOUNT OF $500 OF IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D;)

ATTRIBUTED TO THE HUGHES ACQUISITION IN 2000 DISCUSSED BELOW WAS DETERMINED BY

AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION USING THE INCOME APPROACH.

THIRTEEN PROJECTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE VALUATION, OF WHICH THE PRINCIPAL

PROJECTS WERE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING: TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATED WITH

HIGH-EFFICIENCY SOLAR CELLS AND SATELLITE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY ($189), PHASED

ARRAY AND DIGITAL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND SERVICE

($89), AND XENON-ION SYSTEMS FOR SATELLITE ENGINE PROPULSION ($82). THE FAIR

VALUE OF IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES WAS ALSO DETERMINED BY AN INDEPENDENT

VALUATION PRIMARILY USING THE INCOME APPROACH. THE FOLLOWING RISK-ADJUSTED

DISCOUNT RATES WERE USED TO DISCOUNT THE PROJECT CASH FLOWS: SOLAR CELLS AND

SATELLITE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY, 17%; PHASED ARRAY AND DIGITAL PROCESSING

TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND SERVICE, 18%; XENON-ION SYSTEMS

FOR SATELLITE ENGINE PROPULSION, 18%; ALL OTHER PROJECTS, 18.2% WEIGHTED

AVERAGE. OPERATING MARGINS WERE ASSUMED TO BE SIMILAR TO HISTORICAL MARGINS

OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS. THE SIZE OF THE APPLICABLE MARKET WAS VERIFIED FOR

REASONABLENESS WITH OUTSIDE RESEARCH SOURCES. THE PROJECTS WERE IN VARIOUS

STAGES OF COMPLETION RANGING FROM APPROXIMATELY 31% TO 92% COMPLETE AS OF THE

VALUATION DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE PERCENTAGES COMPLETE BY PROJECT

WERE AS FOLLOWS: SOLAR CELLS AND SATELLITE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY, 80%; PHASED

ARRAY AND DIGITAL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, 95%; XENON-ION SYSTEMS FOR SATELLITE

ENGINE PROPULSION, 90%. THE STAGE OF COMPLETION FOR EACH PROJECT WAS ESTIMATED

BY EVALUATING THE COST TO COMPLETE, COMPLEXITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND TIME TO

MARKET. THE PROJECTS ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE COMPLETED BETWEEN 2002 AND 2004.

THE ESTIMATED COST TO COMPLETE THE PROJECTS IS $50.

THE DISCOUNT RATES STATED PREVIOUSLY ARE HIGHER THAN THE COMPANY'S WEIGHTED

AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES IN THE ESTIMATES

DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY, INCLUDING THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE SUCCESSFUL

COMPLETION OF THE PURCHASED IN-PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, THE USEFUL LIFE OF SUCH

TECHNOLOGY, THE PROFITABILITY LEVELS OF SUCH TECHNOLOGY AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF

THE TIMING OF THE RELATED PRODUCT INTRODUCTION AND THEN-EXISTING COMPETING

PRODUCTS. IF THESE PROJECTS ARE NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED, THE FUTURE REVENUE

AND PROFITABILITY OF BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

ADDITIONALLY, THE VALUE OF THE OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED MAY BECOME

IMPAIRED.

THE FAIR VALUE AMOUNT OF $45 OF IPR&D; ATTRIBUTED TO THE ACQUISITION OF JEPPESEN

SANDERSON, INC., WAS DETERMINED BY AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION. THE ACQUIRED IPR&D;

TECHNOLOGY CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THREE SOFTWARE PROJECTS THAT WILL WORK TOGETHER

TO STORE INFORMATION AND EXTRACT IT FOR USE IN VARIOUS PRODUCTS SOLD BY

JEPPESEN. THE TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW THE PRODUCTION OF END USER AERONAUTICAL

INFORMATION WITH FORWARD AND BACKWARD DATE EFFECTIVITY, AND WILL ALLOW THE

EXTRACTION OF THE INFORMATION ON A NEAR REAL TIME BASIS. FURTHERMORE, THE

TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW THE CREATION OF PACKAGES OF AERONAUTICAL INFORMATION,

WHICH CAN BE TAILORED TO INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE. THESE ACQUIRED IPR&D;

PROJECTS WERE COMPLETED DURING 2001, WITH THE FULL RANGE AND PRODUCTION OF THE

TECHNOLOGY ANTICIPATED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. THE COMPLETED TECHNOLOGY

CAN ONLY BE USED FOR ITS SPECIFIC AND INTENDED PURPOSE AND AS SUCH NO

ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES EXIST. THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY WAS DETERMINED USING

THE INCOME APPROACH, AND A RISK-ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE OF 15% WAS USED TO

DISCOUNT THE PROJECT CASH FLOW. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001,

JEPPESEN HAD COMPLETED ALL IPR&D; PROJECTS FOR A TOTAL COST OF $18.

OTHER ACQUISITIONS RESULTING IN THE RECOGNITION OF IPR&D; DURING 2000 USING A

SIMILAR INCOME APPROACH INCLUDED CONTINENTAL GRAPHICS CORP. ($7 IPR&D;) AND

AUTOMETRIC, INC. ($5 IPR&D;).

CORPORATION (DISC) AND ITS FOREIGN SALES CORPORATION (FSC) FOR THE YEARS 1979

THROUGH 1987. IN SEPTEMBER 1998, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THE COMPANY'S MOTION

FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE APPEALED THIS DECISION. ON

AUGUST 2, 2001, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT

REVERSED THE DISTRICT COURT'S SUMMARY JUDGMENT. THE COMPANY FILED A PETITION

FOR REHEARING WITH THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS AND WAS DENIED SUCH

REHEARING. THE COMPANY FILED A PETITION FOR WRIT OF CERTIORARI WITH THE UNITED

STATES SUPREME COURT AND IS AWAITING THE COURT'S DECISION ON WHETHER TO GRANT

HEARING OF THIS CASE BEFORE THE COURT. THE COMPANY HAS FULLY PROVIDED FOR

ANY POTENTIAL EARNINGS IMPACT THAT MAY RESULT FROM THIS DECISION. IF THE

COMPANY WERE TO PREVAIL, THE REFUND WOULD INCLUDE INTEREST COMPUTED TO THE

PAYMENT DATE.

INCOME TAX PAYMENTS, NET OF TAX REFUNDS, WERE $1,521, $405 AND $575 IN 2001,

2000 AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS NONCONTRIBUTORY PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

EMPLOYEES. ALL MAJOR PENSION PLANS ARE FUNDED AND ALL BUT TWO HAVE PLAN ASSETS

THAT EXCEED ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS. TWO PENSION PLANS ATTRIBUTABLE TO

CERTAIN HOURLY EMPLOYEES HAVE ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS THAT EXCEED PLAN

ASSETS. THE LOSS OF $555 IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001, RELATES PRINCIPALLY TO THE UNRECOGNIZED NET ACTUARIAL

LOSSES OF THESE PLANS.

91

92

CERTAIN OF THE PENSION PLANS PROVIDE THAT, IN THE EVENT THERE IS A CHANGE IN

CONTROL OF THE COMPANY WHICH IS NOT APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE

PLANS ARE TERMINATED WITHIN FIVE YEARS THEREAFTER, THE ASSETS IN THE PLAN FIRST

WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS REQUIRED BY THE

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT, AND THEN ANY SURPLUS WILL BE USED TO

FUND A TRUST TO CONTINUE PRESENT AND FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER THE POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS IN THE COMPANY'S GROUP INSURANCE BENEFIT

PROGRAMS.

THE COMPANY HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OF

THE COMPANY PENSION PLANS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, SHOULD THE COMPANY TERMINATE

ANY OF THE PLANS UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE PLAN'S ASSETS EXCEED THAT

PLAN'S OBLIGATIONS, THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE ENTITLED TO A FAIR ALLOCATION OF

ANY OF THE PLAN'S ASSETS BASED ON PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE REIMBURSED

UNDER GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. ALSO, THE REVENUE RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1990

IMPOSES A 20% NONDEDUCTIBLE EXCISE TAX ON THE GROSS ASSETS REVERTED IF THE

COMPANY ESTABLISHES A QUALIFIED REPLACEMENT PLAN OR AMENDS THE TERMINATING

PLAN TO PROVIDE FOR BENEFIT INCREASES; OTHERWISE, A 50% TAX IS APPLIED. ANY

NET AMOUNT RETAINED BY THE COMPANY IS TREATED AS TAXABLE INCOME.

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 6, 2000, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF

HUGHES' PENSION ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE ACQUIRED PENSION PLANS' ASSETS

EXCEEDED LIABILITIES BY $626. THIS ACQUISITION COMPRISED A SUBSTANTIAL

PORTION OF THE YEAR 2000 'ACQUISITION/DISPOSITION, NET' ACTIVITY.

THE COMPANY HAS CERTAIN UNFUNDED AND PARTIALLY FUNDED PLANS WITH A

PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF $3,301 AND $488, PLAN ASSETS OF $2,481 AND

$17, AND UNRECOGNIZED PRIOR SERVICE COSTS AND ACTUARIAL LOSSES OF $1,054

AND $125 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000. THE NET PROVISION FOR THESE PLANS

WAS $34, $56 AND $63 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, 2000 AND 1999,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE PRINCIPAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS ARE THE COMPANY-SPONSORED 401(K)

PLANS AND A FUNDED PLAN FOR UNUSED SICK LEAVE. THE PROVISION FOR THESE

DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN 2001, 2000 AND 1999, WAS $452, $406 AND $409,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY'S POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS CONSIST

PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING

DEPENDENTS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, LIFE INSURANCE TO CERTAIN GROUPS OF

RETIREES. RETIREE HEALTH CARE IS PROVIDED PRINCIPALLY UNTIL AGE 65 FOR

APPROXIMATELY HALF THOSE RETIREES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.

CERTAIN EMPLOYEE GROUPS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES COVERED BY MOST UNITED AUTO

WORKERS BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, ARE PROVIDED LIFETIME HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.

BENEFIT COSTS WERE CALCULATED BASED ON ASSUMED COST GROWTH FOR RETIREE

HEALTH CARE COSTS OF A 9% ANNUAL RATE FOR 2002, DECREASING TO A 5% ANNUAL

GROWTH RATE BY 2010. IN 2001, BENEFIT COSTS FOR RETIREE HEALTH CARE WERE

CALCULATED BASED ON AN ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 9.5%, DECREASING TO A 5.5%

ANNUAL GROWTH RATE BY 2010.

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

--------------------

IN AUGUST 1998, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING

MANAGEMENT TO REPURCHASE UP TO 15% OF THE COMPANY'S ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING

STOCK AS OF JUNE 30, 1998 (EXCLUDING SHARES HELD BY THE SHAREVALUE TRUST),

WHICH AMOUNTED TO 145,899,000 SHARES. THIS REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS COMPLETED

PERFORMANCE SHARES

PERFORMANCE SHARES ARE STOCK UNITS THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE TO COMMON STOCK

CONTINGENT UPON STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE. IF, AT ANY TIME UP TO FIVE YEARS AFTER

AWARD, THE STOCK PRICE REACHES AND MAINTAINS A PRICE EQUAL TO 161.0% OF THE

STOCK ISSUE PRICE AT THE DATE OF THE AWARD (REPRESENTING A GROWTH RATE OF 10%

COMPOUNDED ANNUALLY FOR FIVE YEARS), 25% OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED ARE

CONVERTIBLE TO COMMON STOCK. LIKEWISE, AT STOCK PRICES EQUAL TO 168.5%, 176.2%,

184.2%, 192.5% AND 201.1% OF THE STOCK PRICE AT THE DATE OF AWARD, THE

CUMULATIVE PORTION OF AWARDED PERFORMANCE SHARES CONVERTIBLE TO COMMON STOCK

ARE 40%, 55%, 75%, 100% AND 125%, RESPECTIVELY. PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDS NOT

CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK EXPIRE FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF THE AWARD;

HOWEVER, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY, AT ITS

DISCRETION, ALLOW VESTING OF UP TO 100% OF THE TARGET PERFORMANCE SHARES IF

THE COMPANY'S TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (STOCK PRICE APPRECIATION PLUS

DIVIDENDS) DURING THE FIVE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE TOTAL

SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF THE S&P; 500 OVER THE SAME PERIOD.

NO PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS WERE CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK OR DEFERRED STOCK

UNITS IN 2001. DURING 2000, 75% OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS EXPIRING

FEBRUARY 22, 2004, WERE CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK OR DEFERRED STOCK UNITS

(CUMULATIVE 3,402,874 PERFORMANCE SHARES), AND 55% OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARE

AND 1999, RESPECTIVELY.

SHAREVALUE TRUST

THE SHAREVALUE TRUST, ESTABLISHED EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 1996, IS A 14-YEAR

IRREVOCABLE TRUST THAT HOLDS BOEING COMMON STOCK, RECEIVES DIVIDENDS,

AND DISTRIBUTES TO EMPLOYEES APPRECIATION IN VALUE ABOVE A 3% PER ANNUM

THRESHOLD RATE OF RETURN. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE TRUST HELD

39,691,015 SHARES OF THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK, SPLIT EQUALLY BETWEEN

TWO FUNDS, "FUND 1" AND "FUND 2." IF ON JUNE 30, 2002, THE MARKET VALUE OF

FUND 1 EXCEEDS $949 (THE THRESHOLD REPRESENTING A 3% PER ANNUM RATE OF

RETURN), THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE THRESHOLD WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO

EMPLOYEES. THE JUNE 30, 2002, MARKET VALUE OF FUND 1 AFTER DISTRIBUTION

(IF ANY) WILL BE THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING ANY POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION ON

JUNE 30, 2006. SIMILARLY, IF ON JUNE 30, 2004, THE MARKET VALUE OF FUND 2

EXCEEDS $913, THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE THRESHOLD WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO

EMPLOYEES. SHARES HELD BY THE TRUST ON JUNE 30, 2010, AFTER FINAL

DISTRIBUTION WILL REVERT BACK TO THE COMPANY.

THE SHAREVALUE TRUST IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CONTRA-EQUITY ACCOUNT AND

STATED AT MARKET VALUE. MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ARE OFFSET TO ADDITIONAL

PAID-IN CAPITAL.

STOCK OPTIONS

THE COMPANY'S 1997 INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN PERMITS THE GRANT OF STOCK OPTIONS,

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS) AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS (DENOMINATED

IN STOCK OR STOCK UNITS) TO ANY EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES

AND CONTRACT EMPLOYEES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PLAN, 64,000,000 SHARES ARE

AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UPON EXERCISE OF OPTIONS, AS PAYMENT OF SARS AND AS

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS, OF WHICH NO MORE THAN AN AGGREGATE OF 6,000,000

SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND NO MORE

THAN AN AGGREGATE OF 3,000,000 SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS

RESTRICTED STOCK THAT IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS BASED ON CONTINUOUS

EMPLOYMENT FOR LESS THAN THREE YEARS. THIS AUTHORIZATION FOR ISSUANCE UNDER

94

95

THE 1997 PLAN WILL TERMINATE ON APRIL 30, 2007. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, NO

SARS HAVE BEEN GRANTED UNDER THE 1997 PLAN. THE 1993 INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN

PERMITTED THE GRANT OF OPTIONS, SARS AND STOCK TO EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY

OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE 1988 AND 1984 STOCK OPTION PLANS PERMITTED THE

GRANT OF OPTIONS OR SARS TO OFFICERS OR OTHER KEY EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY

OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES. NO FURTHER GRANTS MAY BE AWARDED UNDER THESE THREE PLANS.

OPTIONS AND SARS HAVE BEEN GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR

MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS

AFTER THE GRANT DATE. VESTING IS GENERALLY OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD WITH

PORTIONS OF A GRANT BECOMING EXERCISABLE AT ONE YEAR, THREE YEARS AND FIVE

YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE. SARS, WHICH HAVE BEEN GRANTED ONLY UNDER THE 1988

AND 1984 PLANS, WERE GRANTED IN TANDEM WITH STOCK OPTIONS; THEREFORE, EXERCISE

OF THE SAR CANCELS THE RELATED OPTION AND EXERCISE OF THE OPTION CANCELS THE

ATTACHED SAR.

IN 1994, MCDONNELL DOUGLAS SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED THE 1994 PERFORMANCE EQUITY

INCENTIVE PLAN. RESTRICTED STOCK ISSUED UNDER THIS PLAN PRIOR TO 1997 VESTED

UPON THE MERGER BETWEEN MCDONNELL DOUGLAS AND THE BOEING COMPANY. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001, A TOTAL OF 594,000 SHARES HAD BEEN GRANTED AND OF THOSE

67,938 REMAIN RESTRICTED. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMPENSATION RELATING TO THESE

RESTRICTED SHARES WILL BE AMORTIZED BY THE END OF 2002. UNEARNED COMPENSATION

IS REFLECTED AS A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY.

OF THE PURPOSE OR INTENT FOR HOLDING THEM.

96

97

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO A VARIETY OF MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND COMMODITY

PRICES. THESE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED, IN PART, WITH THE USE OF DERIVATIVES. THE

FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANY'S RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND THE

EFFECT OF THESE STRATEGIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

FOR DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR

VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED ASSET OR LIABILITY OR A FIRM COMMITMENT (REFERRED TO AS

FAIR VALUE HEDGES), THE GAIN OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD

OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE OFFSETTING LOSS OR GAIN ON THE HEDGED ITEM

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. THE EFFECT OF THAT ACCOUNTING IS TO

REFLECT IN EARNINGS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HEDGE IS NOT EFFECTIVE IN

ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE. INEFFECTIVENESS WAS INSIGNIFICANT

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001.

INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY AGREES TO PAY VARIABLE

RATES OF INTEREST ARE GENERALLY DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE

DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO ADJUST THE

AMOUNT OF TOTAL DEBT THAT IS SUBJECT TO VARIABLE AND FIXED INTEREST RATES.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HOLDS FORWARD-STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS

TO FIX THE COST OF FUNDING A FIRMLY COMMITTED LEASE FOR WHICH PAYMENT TERMS

ARE DETERMINED IN ADVANCE OF FUNDING. THIS HEDGE RELATIONSHIP MITIGATES THE

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED PORTION OF THE FIRM COMMITMENT CAUSED BY

CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THE NET CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE SWAP AND THE

HEDGED PORTION OF THE FIRM COMMITMENT IS REPORTED IN EARNINGS.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, $1 OF GAIN RELATED TO THE BASIS

ADJUSTMENT OF CERTAIN TERMINATED INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS RECORDED IN OTHER

INCOME.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

FOR DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABLE CASH FLOWS

OF A FORECASTED TRANSACTION (REFERRED TO AS CASH FLOW HEDGES), THE EFFECTIVE

PORTION OF THE DERIVATIVE'S GAIN OR LOSS IS INITIALLY REPORTED IN

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY (AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME) AND SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS WHEN THE FORECASTED

TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS

IS REPORTED IN EARNINGS IMMEDIATELY. CASH FLOW HEDGES USED BY THE COMPANY

INCLUDE CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, AND

COMMODITY PURCHASE CONTRACTS.

INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY AGREES TO PAY FIXED

RATES OF INTEREST ARE GENERALLY DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF

VARIABLE-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO

ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL DEBT THAT IS SUBJECT TO VARIABLE AND FIXED

INTEREST RATES.

THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MANAGE CURRENCY

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFICALLY SALES

AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS MADE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY'S FOREIGN

CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HEDGE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS PRINCIPALLY

OCCURRING UP TO FIVE YEARS IN THE FUTURE.

97

98

COMMODITY DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS FIXED-PRICE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, ARE USED

BY THE COMPANY TO HEDGE AGAINST POTENTIALLY UNFAVORABLE PRICE CHANGES FOR

ITEMS USED IN PRODUCTION. IN 2001, THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO CERTAIN

COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS AT FIXED PRICES OVER

THE NEXT THREE YEARS, A PORTION OF WHICH QUALIFY FOR CASH FLOW HEDGE

TREATMENT. PORTIONS THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR CASH FLOW HEDGE TREATMENT

RESULTED IN A LOSS OF $1 RECORDED AS A REDUCTION OF OTHER INCOME FOR THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, A NET UNRECOGNIZED LOSS OF $172 ($108 NET OF TAX)

WAS RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANY'S CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS FOR THE YEAR THEN ENDED. OF THIS

AMOUNT, A NET UNRECOGNIZED LOSS OF $27 ($17 NET OF TAX) WAS DUE TO THE

COMPANY'S TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT UPON IMPLEMENTATION OF SFAS NO. 133, AT

JANUARY 1, 2001.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, A LOSS OF $14, NET OF TAX, REFLECTED

IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WAS RECLASSIFIED TO OTHER INCOME.

DURING THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECLASSIFY TO OTHER

INCOME A LOSS OF $20, NET OF TAX, FROM THE AMOUNT RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECEIVING HEDGE TREATMENT

THE COMPANY HOLDS INTEREST EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS AND RELATED INTEREST RATE

SWAPS. THE INTENT OF THESE INTEREST RATE SWAPS IS TO ECONOMICALLY HEDGE

THE EXPOSURES CREATED BY THE INTEREST EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS. HOWEVER,

BECAUSE THE EXPOSURES BEING HEDGED ARE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, THIS

RELATIONSHIP DOES NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING UNDER SFAS NO. 133.

AS A RESULT, CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF BOTH INSTRUMENTS ARE IMMEDIATELY

RECOGNIZED IN INCOME. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE INTEREST

EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS RESULTED IN OTHER INCOME OF $8 AND THE RELATED

INTEREST RATE SWAPS RESULTED IN A REDUCTION OF OTHER INCOME OF $9.

THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS A FORWARD-STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP THAT IS

NOT ACCOUNTED FOR AS A HEDGE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE CONVERSION FEATURE OF CERTAIN CONVERTIBLE

DEBT AND WARRANTS WERE REFLECTED IN OTHER ASSETS AT THEIR FAIR VALUES OF

$12. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE CONVERSION FEATURE OF THE

CONVERTIBLE DEBT AND WARRANTS RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS HAD AN INCREASE IN

FAIR VALUE, RESULTING IN $2 RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY HAD FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS

CARRIED AT FAIR VALUE THAT DID NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING. THE

COMPANY REALIZED A PRETAX GAIN OF $9 ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE FORWARD

CONTRACTS DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, REFLECTED IN OTHER

INCOME.

UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 133, THE COMPANY RECORDED AN UNRECOGNIZED NET

GAIN OF $9 ($6 NET OF TAX) IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

ATTRIBUTABLE TO DERIVATIVES NOT RECEIVING HEDGE TREATMENT. THE COMPONENTS

OF THIS TRANSITION ADJUSTMENT ARE BEING AMORTIZED TO OTHER INCOME, WITH A

NET LOSS OF $1 EXPECTED TO BE RECLASSIFIED TO OTHER INCOME DURING THE NEXT

TWELVE MONTHS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE UNAMORTIZED BALANCE IN ACCUMULATED

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME WAS A NET GAIN OF $9 ($6 NET OF TAX).

98

99

INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE

ENTERED INTO WITH A NUMBER OF MAJOR FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS IN ORDER TO

MINIMIZE COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISK. THE COMPANY GENERALLY DOES NOT REQUIRE

COLLATERAL OR OTHER SECURITY SUPPORTING DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS WITH ITS

COUNTERPARTIES. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT IT IS UNLIKELY THAT ANY OF ITS

COUNTERPARTIES WILL BE UNABLE TO PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF DERIVATIVE

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

NOTE 24

ARRANGEMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK

----------------------------------------

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

RISK IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, PRINCIPALLY RELATING TO CUSTOMER

FINANCING ACTIVITIES. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

RISK INCLUDE FINANCING COMMITMENTS, CREDIT GUARANTEES, AND PARTICIPATION

IN CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS THAT INVOLVE

INTEREST RATE TERMS DIFFERENT FROM THE UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES.

IRREVOCABLE FINANCING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER,

INCLUDING OPTIONS, SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY THROUGH 2010 TOTALED $7,508 AND

$6,230 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT NOT

ALL OF THESE COMMITMENTS WILL BE UTILIZED AND THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO

ARRANGE FOR THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS TO ASSUME A PORTION OF THE REMAINING

COMMITMENTS, IF NECESSARY. THE COMPANY HAS ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS TO

ARRANGE FOR COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT FINANCING TOTALING $344 AND $288 AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000.

PARTICIPATIONS IN CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES WITH THIRD-PARTY

INVESTORS THAT INVOLVE INTEREST RATE TERMS DIFFERENT FROM THE UNDERLYING

RECEIVABLES TOTALED $51 AND $54 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000.

THE COMPANY'S MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH

CREDIT GUARANTEES, WITHOUT REGARD TO COLLATERAL BUT NET OF ESTABLISHED

RESERVES, TOTALED $558 ($174 ASSOCIATED WITH COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND

COLLATERALIZED AND $357 ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEA LAUNCH JOINT VENTURE) AND

$655 ($261 ASSOCIATED WITH COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND COLLATERALIZED AND

$373 ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEA LAUNCH JOINT VENTURE) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001

AND 2000. OF THE $174 EXPOSURE ASSOCIATED WITH COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, PRINCIPALLY COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT, WOULD COVER

APPROXIMATELY $63 OF THE EXPOSURE. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CREDIT-RELATED GUARANTEES HAVE BEEN EXTENDED ON BEHALF

OF COUNTERPARTIES WITH LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. THE

CREDIT-RELATED EXPOSURE RELATED TO SEA LAUNCH IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY COVERED

BY A COLLATERAL POSITION IN ANY ASSETS.

THE COMPANY'S MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET VALUE

GUARANTEES, WITHOUT REGARD TO COLLATERAL BUT NET OF ESTABLISHED RESERVES,

TOTALED $725 AND $522 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000. THESE EXPOSURES

RELATE PRINCIPALLY TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND ARE COLLATERALIZED. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, PRINCIPALLY COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT, WOULD COVER

APPROXIMATELY $680 OF THE EXPOSURE.

99

100

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES

INCLUDED $416 ($48 RELATED TO THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001) AND $343

ATTRIBUTABLE TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT-RELATED GUARANTEES AND

ASSET VALUE GUARANTEES.

OTHER ARRANGEMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, FUTURE LEASE COMMITMENTS ON AIRCRAFT NOT RECORDED

ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION TOTALED $323. THESE

LEASE COMMITMENTS EXTEND THROUGH 2015, AND THE COMPANY'S INTENT IS TO

RECOVER THESE LEASE COMMITMENTS THROUGH SUBLEASE ARRANGEMENTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES

INCLUDED $116 ($1 RELATED TO THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001) AND $114

ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADVERSE COMMITMENTS UNDER THESE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY HAS COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE USED

AIRCRAFT UNDER TRADE-IN AGREEMENTS TOTALING $1,340. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDED $189

($140 RELATED TO THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001) ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADVERSE

PURCHASE COMMITMENTS.

THE COMPANY HOLDS VARIOUS ENHANCED EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES (EETCS)

TOTALING $128 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, RELATING TO AIRCRAFT LEASE

RECEIVABLES. THE MAXIMUM EXPOSURE IS GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE AMOUNT OF

THE ASSET RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION.

UNDER ONE EETC ARRANGEMENT, HOWEVER, THE COMPANY HAS A MAXIMUM POTENTIAL

EXPOSURE OF $103 IN EXCESS OF ITS ASSET VALUE DUE TO CERTAIN LIQUIDITY

OBLIGATIONS OF THE COMPANY TO OTHER PARTIES IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY

THE LESSEE. IN THE EVENT OF PAYMENT UNDER THIS LIQUIDITY OBLIGATION,

THE COMPANY WOULD RECEIVE A PREFERRED COLLATERAL POSITION IN THE

UNDERLYING ASSET.

NOTE 25

SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

-----------------------------------------------

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INVOLVING POTENTIAL CREDIT RISK ARE PREDOMINANTLY

WITH COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001, OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DESCRIBED IN

NOTE 24 PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS. OF THE

$15,554 IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND CUSTOMER FINANCING INCLUDED IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION, $7,235 RELATED TO

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS ($366 OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND $6,869

OF CUSTOMER FINANCING) AND $2,597 RELATED TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

AMR CORPORATION AND UAL CORPORATION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH 23% AND 13% OF

ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RELATED TO CUSTOMER FINANCING. FINANCING FOR

AIRCRAFT IS COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITY IN THE RELATED ASSET, AND

HISTORICALLY THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED A PROBLEM IN ACCESSING

SUCH COLLATERAL.

OF THE $6,869 OF AIRCRAFT CUSTOMER FINANCING, $6,440 RELATED TO CUSTOMERS

THE COMPANY BELIEVES HAVE LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. SIMILARLY,

OF THE $7,508 OF IRREVOCABLE FINANCING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON

ORDER INCLUDING OPTIONS, $7,113 RELATED TO CUSTOMERS THE COMPANY BELIEVES

HAVE LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT

100

101

NOTE 26

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

-----------------------------------------------------

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE WAS $5,156 AND $5,519, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE WAS ESTIMATED TO BE $5,054 AND $5,355. THE LOWER FAIR VALUE

REFLECTS A DISCOUNT DUE TO DEFERRED COLLECTION FOR CERTAIN RECEIVABLES

THAT WILL BE COLLECTED OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD. THE CARRYING VALUE OF

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE IS ESTIMATED TO APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE.

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF NOTES RECEIVABLE, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE, IS

ESTIMATED TO APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE GENERALLY NO

QUOTED MARKET PRICES AVAILABLE FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING NOTES RECEIVABLE,

THE VALUATION ASSESSMENTS WERE BASED ON THE RESPECTIVE INTEREST RATES,

RISK-RELATED RATE SPREADS AND COLLATERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND 2000, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF DEBT, NET OF

CAPITAL LEASES AND NON-RECOURSE DEBT, WAS $11,198 AND $8,410 AND THE FAIR

VALUE OF DEBT, BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RATES FOR DEBT OF THE SAME RISK AND

MATURITIES, WAS ESTIMATED AT $11,669 AND $8,866. THE COMPANY'S DEBT,

HOWEVER, IS GENERALLY NOT CALLABLE UNTIL MATURITY.

WITH REGARD TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK, IT IS

NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF FUTURE FINANCING COMMITMENTS

BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A MARKET FOR SUCH FUTURE COMMITMENTS, AND ALL OTHER

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE ONLY A

NOMINAL FAIR VALUE. THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS REFLECTED IN THE OUTSTANDING

GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS FOR FINANCING ASSISTANCE ARE NOT MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT FROM THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2001.

NOTE 27

CONTINGENCIES

-------------

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS,

CONTRACTS AND OTHER MATTERS ARE PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY. MOST

SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO MATTERS COVERED BY INSURANCE.

MAJOR CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF

THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THOSE FOR DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND

REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES. DUE IN PART TO THEIR COMPLEXITY AND

PERVASIVENESS, SUCH REQUIREMENTS HAVE RESULTED IN THE COMPANY BEING

INVOLVED WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS

SINCE THE 1980S.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES, BASED ON IN-DEPTH STUDIES, EXPERT ANALYSES

AND LEGAL REVIEWS, ITS CONTINGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS FOR

REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RANGES AND

PROBABILITIES OF RECOVERIES FROM OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO HAVE AND

HAVE NOT AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT AND OF RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS.

THE COMPANY'S POLICY IS TO IMMEDIATELY ACCRUE AND CHARGE TO CURRENT

EXPENSE IDENTIFIED EXPOSURES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SITES

BASED ON ESTIMATES OF INVESTIGATION, CLEANUP AND MONITORING COSTS TO BE

INCURRED.

101

102

THE COSTS INCURRED AND EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH

ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT HAD, AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT

TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION. WITH RESPECT TO RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS, RELATED CHARGES HAVE AVERAGED LESS THAN 2% OF ANNUAL NET

EARNINGS. SUCH ACCRUALS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, WITHOUT CONSIDERATION

FOR THE RELATED CONTINGENT RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS, ARE LESS

THAN 2% OF TOTAL LIABILITIES.

BECAUSE OF THE REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES AND RISK OF UNIDENTIFIED

CONTAMINATED SITES AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE

ESTIMATED COSTS ACCRUED FOR IDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED SITES. HOWEVER, BASED

ON ALL KNOWN FACTS AND EXPERT ANALYSES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS NOT

REASONABLY LIKELY THAT IDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES WILL RESULT

IN ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE

COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOW TRENDS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS FROM WHICH CIVIL,

CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT. SUCH PROCEEDINGS

COULD INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES, COMPENSATORY

AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION AND/OR FORFEITURES. UNDER GOVERNMENT

REGULATIONS, A COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS OPERATING DIVISIONS OR

SUBDIVISIONS, CAN ALSO BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS,

OR LOSE ITS EXPORT PRIVILEGES, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES, BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT THE

OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH GOVERNMENT DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION OR CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

IN 1991, THE U.S. NAVY NOTIFIED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS (NOW A SUBSIDIARY OF THE

COMPANY) AND GENERAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION (THE "TEAM") THAT IT WAS

TERMINATING FOR DEFAULT THE TEAM'S CONTRACT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL

PRODUCTION OF THE A-12 AIRCRAFT. THE TEAM FILED A LEGAL ACTION TO CONTEST

THE NAVY'S DEFAULT TERMINATION, TO ASSERT ITS RIGHTS TO CONVERT THE

TERMINATION TO ONE FOR "THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT," AND TO OBTAIN

PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COSTS INCURRED ON THE A-12 CONTRACT BUT NOT PAID

TO DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, INVENTORIES INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $583

OF RECORDED COSTS ON THE A-12 CONTRACT, AGAINST WHICH THE COMPANY HAS

ESTABLISHED A LOSS PROVISION OF $350. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVISION, WHICH

WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1990, WAS BASED ON MCDONNELL DOUGLAS'S BELIEF, SUPPORTED

BY AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WOULD BE

CONVERTED TO A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, AND THAT THE UPPER RANGE OF

POSSIBLE LOSS ON TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE WAS $350.

ON AUGUST 31, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ISSUED A DECISION

AFTER TRIAL UPHOLDING THE GOVERNMENT'S DEFAULT TERMINATION OF THE A-12

CONTRACT ON THE GROUND THAT THE TEAM COULD NOT MEET THE REVISED CONTRACT

SCHEDULE UNILATERALLY IMPOSED BY THE GOVERNMENT AFTER THE GOVERNMENT HAD

WAIVED THE ORIGINAL SCHEDULE. THE COURT DID NOT, HOWEVER, ENTER A JUDGMENT

FOR THE GOVERNMENT ON ITS CLAIM THAT THE TEAM BE REQUIRED, AS A CONSEQUENCE

OF THE ALLEGED DEFAULT, TO REPAY PROGRESS PAYMENTS THAT HAD NOT BEEN

FORMALLY LIQUIDATED BY DELIVERIES AT THE TIME OF TERMINATION. THESE

UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS TOTAL $1,350. ON OCTOBER 4, 2001, THE COURT

CONFIRMED THAT IT WOULD NOT BE ENTERING JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE GOVERNMENT

IN THE AMOUNT OF THESE UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS. THIS IS THE LATEST

DECISION RELATING TO LONG-RUNNING LITIGATION RESULTING FROM THE A-12 CONTRACT

TERMINATION IN 1991, AND FOLLOWS AN EARLIER TRIAL COURT DECISION IN FAVOR OF

THE CONTRACTORS AND REVERSAL OF THAT INITIAL DECISION

ON APPEAL.

102

103

THE COMPANY BELIEVES, SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE

TRIAL COURT'S RULINGS WITH RESPECT TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE UNILATERAL

SCHEDULE AND THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT ARE CONTRARY TO LAW AND FACT. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES THE DECISION RAISES VALID ISSUES FOR APPEAL AND IS PURSUING

ITS APPEAL.

IF, CONTRARY TO THE COMPANY'S BELIEF, THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT ON

TERMINATION WERE SUSTAINED ON APPEAL, THE COMPANY WOULD INCUR AN ADDITIONAL

LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $275, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF REMAINING INVENTORY

COSTS AND ADJUSTMENTS. AND IF, CONTRARY TO THE COMPANY'S BELIEF, THE APPEALS

COURT FURTHER HELD THAT A MONEY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE ENTERED AGAINST THE TEAM

IN THE AMOUNT OF THE UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS, THE TEAM WOULD BE

REQUIRED TO PAY THE GOVERNMENT $1,350 PLUS STATUTORY INTEREST FROM

FEBRUARY 1991 (CURRENTLY TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $970). UNDER THIS OUTCOME,

THE COMPANY WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO PAY ONE HALF OF THESE AMOUNTS. THE

ADDITIONAL LOSS TO THE COMPANY WOULD TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $1,430 IN PRETAX

CHARGES, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF THE REPAYMENT OBLIGATIONS AND THE

REMAINING INVENTORY COSTS AND ADJUSTMENTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE LOSS PROVISION ESTABLISHED BY MCDONNELL

DOUGLAS IN 1990 CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE

REDUCTION IN VALUE OF A-12 NET CONTRACTS IN PROCESS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001.

FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE A-12 LITIGATION WILL DEPEND UPON THE OUTCOME OF

FURTHER PROCEEDINGS OR POSSIBLE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

ON OCTOBER 31, 1997, A FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWSUIT WAS FILED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON,

IN SEATTLE. THE LAWSUIT NAMES AS DEFENDANTS THE COMPANY AND THREE OF ITS THEN

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS OF A SIMILAR NATURE HAVE BEEN FILED

IN THE SAME COURT. THESE LAWSUITS WERE CONSOLIDATED ON FEBRUARY 24, 1998.

THE LAWSUITS GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS DESIRED TO KEEP THE

COMPANY'S SHARE PRICE AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS SHAREHOLDERS WOULD APPROVE THE MERGER AND, IN THE CASE

OF THE INDIVIDUAL DEFENDANTS, TO BENEFIT DIRECTLY FROM THE SALE OF BOEING

STOCK DURING THE PERIOD FROM APRIL 7, 1997 THROUGH OCTOBER 22, 1997. BY ORDER

DATED MAY 1, 2000, THE COURT CERTIFIED TWO SUBCLASSES OF PLAINTIFFS IN THE

ACTION: A. ALL PERSONS OR ENTITIES WHO PURCHASED BOEING STOCK OR CALL OPTIONS

OR WHO SOLD PUT OPTIONS DURING THE PERIOD FROM JULY 21, 1997 THROUGH

OCTOBER 22, 1997, AND B. ALL PERSONS OR ENTITIES WHO PURCHASED MCDONNELL

DOUGLAS STOCK ON OR AFTER APRIL 7, 1997, AND WHO HELD SUCH STOCK UNTIL IT

CONVERTED TO BOEING STOCK PURSUANT TO THE MERGER. THE PLAINTIFFS SOUGHT

COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND TREBLE DAMAGES. ON SEPTEMBER 17, 2001, THE COMPANY

REACHED AGREEMENT WITH CLASS COUNSEL TO SETTLE THE LAWSUIT FOR $92.5. THE

SETTLEMENT WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE COMPANY'S EARNINGS, CASH FLOW OR

FINANCIAL POSITION, AS IT IS WITHIN INSURANCE LIMITS. THE SETTLEMENT

IS CONDITIONED ON NOTICE TO THE CLASS MEMBERS AND COURT APPROVAL, WHICH IS

EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN 2002.

ON FEBRUARY 25, 2000, A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ALLEGING GENDER

DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT WAS FILED AGAINST THE BOEING COMPANY, BOEING

NORTH AMERICAN, INC., AND MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION. THE COMPLAINT,

FILED WITH THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE, ALLEGES THAT THE

COMPANY HAS ENGAGED IN A PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION,

HARASSMENT AND RETALIATION AGAINST FEMALES OVER THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS.

THE COMPLAINT, BECK V. BOEING, NAMES 28 WOMEN WHO HAVE WORKED FOR BOEING

IN THE PUGET SOUND AREA; WICHITA, KANSAS; ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI; AND TULSA,

103

104

OKLAHOMA. ON MARCH 15, 2000, AN AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED NAMING AN

ADDITIONAL 10 PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING THE FIRST FROM CALIFORNIA. THE LAWSUIT

ATTEMPTS TO REPRESENT ALL WOMEN WHO CURRENTLY WORK FOR THE COMPANY, OR WHO

HAVE WORKED FOR THE COMPANY IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS.

THE COMPANY HAS DENIED THE ALLEGATION THAT IT HAS ENGAGED IN ANY UNLAWFUL

"PATTERN AND PRACTICE." PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION WAS FILED

IN MAY 2001. THE CLASS THEY SOUGHT INCLUDED SALARIED EMPLOYEES IN PUGET

SOUND, WICHITA, ST. LOUIS, AND LONG BEACH, AND HOURLY EMPLOYEES IN PUGET

SOUND, WICHITA, AND ST. LOUIS.

ON OCTOBER 19, 2001, THE COURT GRANTED CLASS CERTIFICATION TO A SEGMENT OF

THE POPULATION SOUGHT BY THE PLAINTIFFS. THE COURT RULED THAT THE ACTION

COULD PROCEED ON THE BASIS OF TWO LIMITED SUBCLASSES: A. ALL NON-EXECUTIVE

SALARIED WOMEN (INCLUDING ENGINEERS) IN THE PUGET SOUND AREA, AND B. ALL

HOURLY WOMEN COVERED BY THE MACHINISTS' BARGAINING AGREEMENT IN THE PUGET

SOUND AREA. THE CLAIMS TO BE LITIGATED ARE ALLEGED GENDER DISCRIMINATION IN

COMPENSATION AND PROMOTION. THE COURT ALSO HELD THAT THE PLAINTIFFS COULD

NOT SEEK BACK PAY. RATHER, SHOULD LIABILITY BE FOUND, THE POTENTIAL REMEDIES

INCLUDE SOME FORM OF INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AS WELL AS PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE

U.S. NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS HAS ACCEPTED THE COMPANY'S INTERLOCUTORY

APPEAL OF THE CLASS CERTIFICATION DECISION, PARTICULARLY THE RULING THAT

LEAVES OPEN THE POSSIBILITY OF PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

CONTINUE ITS AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE OF THESE CASES. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT

WHAT IMPACT, IF ANY, THESE CASES COULD HAVE ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOTE 28

SEGMENT INFORMATION

-------------------

THE COMPANY IS ORGANIZED BASED ON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IT OFFERS.

UNDER THIS ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, THE COMPANY OPERATES IN THE FOLLOWING

PRINCIPAL AREAS: COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES, MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS,

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS, AND CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING. COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANES OPERATIONS PRINCIPALLY INVOLVE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND

MARKETING OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT AND PROVIDING RELATED SUPPORT

SERVICES, PRINCIPALLY TO THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE. MILITARY

AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS OPERATIONS PRINCIPALLY INVOLVE RESEARCH,

DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, MODIFICATION AND SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS

AND RELATED SYSTEMS: MILITARY AIRCRAFT, BOTH LAND-BASED AND AIRCRAFT-CARRIER-

BASED, INCLUDING FIGHTER, TRANSPORT AND ATTACK AIRCRAFT WITH WIDE MISSION

CAPABILITY, AND VERTICAL/SHORT TAKEOFF AND LANDING CAPABILITY; HELICOPTERS

AND MISSILES. SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS OPERATIONS PRINCIPALLY INVOLVE

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, MODIFICATION AND SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING

PRODUCTS AND RELATED SYSTEMS: SPACE SYSTEMS, MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS,

SATELLITES AND SATELLITE LAUNCHING VEHICLES, ROCKET ENGINES, AND INFORMATION

AND BATTLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. ALTHOUGH SOME MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE

SYSTEMS AND SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS ARE CONTRACTED IN THE COMMERCIAL

ENVIRONMENT, THE PRIMARY CUSTOMER IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE CUSTOMER AND

COMMERCIAL FINANCING SEGMENT IS PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE FINANCING OF

COMMERCIAL AND PRIVATE AIRCRAFT, COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT, AND REAL ESTATE.

IN 2001, THE COMPANY ADJUSTED THE SEGMENT CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES. THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED AN "OTHER" SEGMENT CLASSIFICATION WHICH

PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES THE ACTIVITIES OF CONNEXION BY BOEINGSM, A TWO-WAY

DATA COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE FOR GLOBAL TRAVELERS; AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT, A

BUSINESS UNIT DEVELOPING NEW APPROACHES TO A GLOBAL SOLUTION TO ADDRESS AIR

104

105

TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT ISSUES; AND PHANTOM WORKS, AN ADVANCED RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, IMPROVED

PROCESSES AND THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS. THE RESULTS FOR 2000 AND 1999

HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE REVISED SEGMENT CLASSIFICATIONS.

THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT IS SUBJECT TO BOTH OPERATIONAL AND

EXTERNAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT RISKS. OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT CAN SERIOUSLY

DISRUPT THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MAKE TIMELY DELIVERY OF ITS COMMERCIAL

JET AIRCRAFT AND MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS INCLUDE EXECUTION OF

INTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH

REGULATORY CERTIFICATIONS OF THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT BY THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, OTHER REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES,

COLLECTIVE BARGAINING LABOR DISPUTES, PERFORMANCE ISSUES WITH KEY

SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS AND THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY

RESOURCES, SUCH AS ELECTRICAL POWER. AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS, PARTICULARLY NEW

AIRCRAFT MODELS SUCH AS THE 717 PROGRAM, FACE THE ADDITIONAL RISK OF

PRICING PRESSURES AND COST MANAGEMENT ISSUES INHERENT IN THE DESIGN AND

PRODUCTION OF COMPLEX PRODUCTS. FINANCING SUPPORT MAY BE PROVIDED BY THE

COMPANY TO AIRLINES, SOME OF WHICH ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN OTHER FINANCING.

WHILE THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS ARE IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA,

AND AUSTRALIA, SOME KEY SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS ARE LOCATED IN EUROPE

AND JAPAN. EXTERNAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT RISKS INCLUDE ADVERSE GOVERNMENTAL

EXPORT AND IMPORT POLICIES, FACTORS THAT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT AND PROLONGED

DISRUPTION TO AIR TRAVEL WORLDWIDE, AND OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE

ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY. EXAMPLES OF FACTORS

RELATING TO EXTERNAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT RISKS INCLUDE THE VOLATILITY OF

AIRCRAFT FUEL PRICES, GLOBAL TRADE POLICIES, WORLDWIDE POLITICAL STABILITY

AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, ACTS OF AGGRESSION THAT IMPACT THE PERCEIVED SAFETY OF

COMMERCIAL FLIGHT, ESCALATION TRENDS INHERENT IN PRICING THE COMPANY'S

AIRCRAFT, AND A COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY STRUCTURE WHICH RESULTS IN MARKET

PRESSURE TO REDUCE PRODUCT PRICES.

IN ADDITION TO THE FOREGOING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

SEGMENT, THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT AND THE SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGING PRIORITIES OR REDUCTIONS IN

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE AND SPACE BUDGET, AND TERMINATION OF GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS DUE TO UNILATERAL GOVERNMENT ACTION (TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE)

OR FAILURE TO PERFORM (TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT). CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING FINES, COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES,

RESTITUTION, FORFEITURE AND SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS

MAY RESULT FROM VIOLATIONS OF BUSINESS AND COST CLASSIFICATION REGULATIONS ON

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

THE LAUNCH SERVICES MARKET HAS SOME DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY SINCE GLOBAL DEMAND

IS DRIVEN IN PART BY THE LAUNCH CUSTOMERS' ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS.

ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF THE COMPANY'S COMPETITORS FOR LAUNCH SERVICES RECEIVE

DIRECT OR INDIRECT GOVERNMENT FUNDING. THE SATELLITE MARKET INCLUDES SOME

LEASES THAT ARE CONSIDERED TRANSFERRED TO THE CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING

SEGMENT. THE REVENUES FOR THESE TRANSFERS ARE ELIMINATED IN THE 'ACCOUNTING

DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS' CAPTION. IN THE EVENT AN AIRPLANE ACCOUNTED FOR AS

AN OPERATING LEASE IS SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD, THE 'ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES/

ELIMINATIONS' CAPTION WOULD REFLECT THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND OPERATING

PROFIT FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

REDUCED, ON A PER-UNIT BASIS, BY THE AMOUNT PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED FOR FORWARD

LOSSES. PROCEEDS FROM CERTAIN COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT SUPPLIERS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO PARTICIPATION IN DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A

REDUCTION IN THE COST OF INVENTORY RECEIVED FROM THE SUPPLIER UNDER THE PROGRAM

ACCOUNTING METHOD, AND AS AN EXPENSE REDUCTION IN THE PERIOD THE PROCEEDS ARE

RECEIVED FOR INTERNAL MEASUREMENT PURPOSES. THESE ADJUSTMENTS BETWEEN THE

INTERNAL MEASUREMENT METHOD AND THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING METHOD ARE INCLUDED IN

141

142

(2)  THE COMPLIANCE WITH ANY GUIDELINE OR THE REQUEST FROM OR BY ANY

CENTRAL BANK OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY (WHETHER OR NOT HAVING

LAW TO DEDUCT ANY TAXES FROM OR IN RESPECT TO ANY SUM PAYABLE HEREUNDER OR

WITH RESPECT TO ANY ADVANCES OR UNDER ANY NOTE TO ANY LENDER OR THE AGENT,

(I) THE SUM PAYABLE SHALL BE INCREASED AS MAY BE NECESSARY SO THAT AFTER

MAKING ALL REQUIRED DEDUCTIONS (INCLUDING DEDUCTIONS APPLICABLE TO

PAYMENT OF TAXES, THE BORROWER WHICH PAID SUCH TAXES SHALL FURNISH TO THE

AGENT, AT ITS ADDRESS REFERRED TO IN SECTION 8.2, THE ORIGINAL OR A

INTERNAL REVENUE CODE.

(E)  NON-U.S. LENDERS.  EACH LENDER ORGANIZED UNDER THE LAWS OF A JURISDICTION

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES SHALL, ON OR PRIOR TO THE DATE OF ITS EXECUTION

AS REQUESTED IN WRITING BY TBC (BUT ONLY SO LONG THEREAFTER AS SUCH LENDER

REMAINS LAWFULLY ABLE TO DO SO), PROVIDE EACH OF THE AGENT AND TBC WITH TWO

ORIGINAL INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE FORMS W-8BEN OR W-8EC1, AS APPROPRIATE,

OR ANY SUCCESSOR FORM PRESCRIBED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE, TO

ESTABLISH THAT SUCH LENDER IS NOT SUBJECT TO, OR IS ENTITLED TO A REDUCED

RATE OF, UNITED STATES WITHHOLDING TAX ON PAYMENTS PURSUANT TO THIS

AGREEMENT OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY ADVANCES OR ANY NOTES.  IF THE FORMS

PROVIDED BY A LENDER AT THE TIME SUCH LENDER FIRST BECOMES A PARTY TO THIS

AGREEMENT INDICATES A UNITED STATES INTEREST WITHHOLDING TAX RATE IN EXCESS

OF ZERO, WITHHOLDING TAX AT SUCH RATE SHALL BE CONSIDERED EXCLUDED FROM

TAXES UNLESS AND UNTIL SUCH LENDER PROVIDES THE APPROPRIATE FORM CERTIFYING

THAT A LOWER RATE APPLIES, WHEREUPON WITHHOLDING TAX AT SUCH LOWER RATE

ONLY SHALL BE CONSIDERED EXCLUDED FROM TAXES FOR PERIODS GOVERNED BY SUCH

FORM; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT, IF AT THE DATE ON WHICH A LENDER BECOMES A

PARTY TO THIS AGREEMENT, THE LENDER ASSIGNOR WAS ENTITLED TO PAYMENTS UNDER

SUBSECTION 2.14(A) IN RESPECT OF UNITED STATES WITHHOLDING TAX WITH RESPECT

TO INTEREST PAID AT SUCH DATE, THEN, TO SUCH EXTENT, THE TERM TAXES SHALL

INCLUDE (IN ADDITION TO WITHHOLDING TAXES THAT MAY BE IMPOSED IN THE FUTURE

OR OTHER AMOUNTS OTHERWISE INCLUDABLE IN TAXES) UNITED STATES WITHHOLDING

TAX, IF ANY, APPLICABLE WITH RESPECT TO THE LENDER ASSIGNEE ON SUCH DATE.

DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION, OTHER THAN INFORMATION NECESSARY TO COMPUTE THE

TAX PAYABLE AND INFORMATION REQUIRED ON THE DATE HEREOF BY INTERNAL REVENUE

SERVICE FORM W-8BEN OR W-8EC1, THAT THE LENDER REASONABLY CONSIDERS TO BE

CONFIDENTIAL, THE LENDER SHALL GIVE NOTICE THEREOF TO THE RELEVANT

BORROWERS AND SHALL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO INCLUDE IN SUCH FORM OR DOCUMENT

CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.

144

145

(F)  LENDER FAILURE TO PROVIDE IRS FORMS.  FOR ANY PERIOD WITH RESPECT TO WHICH

ANY LENDER HAS FAILED TO PROVIDE TBC WITH THE APPROPRIATE FORM DESCRIBED IN

SUBSECTION 2.14(E) (OTHER THAN IF SUCH FAILURE IS DUE TO A CHANGE IN LAW

OCCURRING AFTER THE DATE ON WHICH A FORM ORIGINALLY WAS REQUIRED TO BE

PROVIDED OR IF SUCH FORM OTHERWISE IS NOT REQUIRED UNDER SUBSECTION

2.14(E)), SUCH LENDER SHALL NOT BE ENTITLED TO INDEMNIFICATION UNDER

SUBSECTION (A) OR (C) WITH RESPECT TO TAXES IMPOSED BY THE UNITED STATES BY

REASON OF SUCH FAILURE; PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT SHOULD A LENDER BECOME

SUBJECT TO TAXES BECAUSE OF ITS FAILURE TO DELIVER A FORM REQUIRED

HEREUNDER, TBC SHALL TAKE SUCH STEPS AS SUCH LENDER SHALL REASONABLY

REQUEST TO ASSIST SUCH LENDER TO RECOVER SUCH TAXES.

2.15   ILLEGALITY.  IF ANY LENDER SHALL NOTIFY THE AGENT THAT EITHER

(A)  THERE IS ANY INTRODUCTION OF, OR CHANGE IN OR IN THE INTERPRETATION

OF, ANY LAW OR REGULATION THAT IN THE OPINION OF COUNSEL FOR SUCH

LENDER IN THE RELEVANT JURISDICTION MAKES IT UNLAWFUL, OR

(B)  ANY CENTRAL BANK OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY ASSERTS THAT IT IS

UNLAWFUL

FOR SUCH LENDER TO CONTINUE TO FUND OR MAINTAIN ANY EURODOLLAR RATE

ADVANCES OR TO PERFORM ITS OBLIGATIONS HEREUNDER WITH RESPECT TO EURODOLLAR

RATE ADVANCES HEREUNDER, THEN, UPON THE ISSUANCE OF SUCH OPINION OF COUNSEL

OR SUCH ASSERTION BY A CENTRAL BANK OR OTHER GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITY, THE

AGENT SHALL GIVE NOTICE OF SUCH OPINION OR ASSERTION TO THE BORROWERS

(ACCOMPANIED BY SUCH OPINION, IF APPLICABLE).  THE BORROWERS SHALL

FORTHWITH EITHER

(I)  PREPAY IN FULL ALL EURODOLLAR RATE COMMITTED ADVANCES AND ALL

EURODOLLAR RATE BID ADVANCES MADE BY SUCH LENDER, WITH ACCRUED

INTEREST THEREON OR

(II) CONVERT EACH SUCH EURODOLLAR RATE COMMITTED ADVANCE MADE BY SUCH

LENDER INTO A BASE RATE ADVANCE.

UPON SUCH PREPAYMENT OR CONVERSION, THE OBLIGATION OF SUCH LENDER TO MAKE

EURODOLLAR RATE COMMITTED ADVANCES OR EURODOLLAR RATE BID ADVANCES, OR TO

CONVERT COMMITTED ADVANCES INTO EURODOLLAR RATE COMMITTED ADVANCES, SHALL

BE SUSPENDED UNTIL THE AGENT SHALL NOTIFY THE BORROWERS THAT THE

CIRCUMSTANCES CAUSING SUCH SUSPENSION NO LONGER EXISTS.

THE AGENT AT THE AGENT'S ACCOUNT IN SAME DAY FUNDS.  THE AGENT SHALL

PROMPTLY THEREAFTER CAUSE TO BE DISTRIBUTED LIKE FUNDS RELATING TO THE

PAYMENT OF PRINCIPAL OR INTEREST OR FEES RATABLY (OTHER THAN AMOUNTS

PAYABLE PURSUANT TO SECTION 2.5, 2.9, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 OR 2.19) TO THE

LENDERS FOR THE ACCOUNT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE APPLICABLE LENDING OFFICES, AND

LENDER TO SUCH LENDER FOR THE ACCOUNT OF ITS APPLICABLE LENDING OFFICE, IN

EACH CASE TO BE APPLIED IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE TERMS OF THIS AGREEMENT.

FROM AND AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF AN ASSIGNMENT PURSUANT TO SECTION

2.20, THE AGENT SHALL MAKE ALL PAYMENTS HEREUNDER AND WITH RESPECT TO ANY

ADVANCES OR UNDER ANY NOTES IN RESPECT OF THE INTEREST ASSIGNED THEREBY TO

THE LENDER ASSIGNEE THEREUNDER, AND THE PARTIES TO SUCH ASSIGNMENT SHALL

MAKE ALL APPROPRIATE ADJUSTMENTS IN SUCH PAYMENTS FOR THE PERIODS PRIOR TO

SUCH EFFECTIVE DATE DIRECTLY BETWEEN THEMSELVES.

(B)  COMPUTATION OF INTEREST AND FEES.  ALL COMPUTATIONS OF INTEREST BASED ON

THE BASE RATE AND UTILIZATION FEES SHALL BE MADE BY THE AGENT ON THE BASIS

OF A YEAR OF 365 OR 366 DAYS, AS THE CASE MAY BE.  ALL COMPUTATIONS OF

INTEREST BASED ON THE EURODOLLAR RATE OR THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE AND OF

FACILITY FEES SHALL BE MADE BY THE AGENT, AND ALL COMPUTATIONS OF INTEREST

PURSUANT TO SECTION 2.9 SHALL BE MADE BY A LENDER, ON THE BASIS OF A YEAR

OF 360 DAYS, IN EACH CASE FOR THE ACTUAL NUMBER OF DAYS (INCLUDING THE

SUCH INTEREST OR FEES ARE PAYABLE.  EACH DETERMINATION BY THE AGENT (OR, IN

THE CASE OF SECTION 2.9, BY A LENDER) OF AN INTEREST RATE HEREUNDER SHALL

BE CONCLUSIVE AND BINDING FOR ALL PURPOSES, ABSENT MANIFEST ERROR.

(C)  PAYMENT DUE DATES.  WHENEVER ANY PAYMENT HEREUNDER OR WITH RESPECT TO ANY

ADVANCES OR UNDER ANY NOTES SHALL BE STATED TO BE DUE ON A DAY OTHER THAN A

BUSINESS DAY, SUCH PAYMENT SHALL BE MADE ON THE NEXT SUCCEEDING BUSINESS

DAY, AND SUCH EXTENSION OF TIME SHALL IN SUCH CASE BE INCLUDED IN THE

COMPUTATION OF PAYMENT OF INTEREST OR FEE, AS THE CASE MAY BE; PROVIDED,

HOWEVER, IF SUCH EXTENSION WOULD CAUSE PAYMENT OF INTEREST ON OR PRINCIPAL

OF EURODOLLAR RATE ADVANCES TO BE MADE IN THE NEXT FOLLOWING CALENDAR

MONTH, SUCH PAYMENT SHALL BE MADE ON THE IMMEDIATELY PRECEDING BUSINESS

DAY.

(D)  PRESUMPTION OF BORROWER PAYMENT.  UNLESS THE AGENT RECEIVES NOTICE FROM A

BORROWER PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH ANY PAYMENT IS DUE TO ANY LENDERS

HEREUNDER THAT SUCH BORROWER WILL NOT MAKE SUCH PAYMENT IN FULL, THE AGENT

MAY ASSUME THAT THE BORROWER HAS MADE SUCH PAYMENT IN FULL TO THE AGENT ON

SUCH DATE AND THE AGENT MAY, IN RELIANCE UPON SUCH ASSUMPTION, CAUSE TO BE

DISTRIBUTED TO EACH SUCH LENDER ON SUCH DUE DATE AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO THE

AMOUNT THEN DUE SUCH LENDER.  IF AND TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH BORROWER HAS

NOT MADE SUCH PAYMENT IN FULL TO THE AGENT, EACH SUCH LENDER SHALL REPAY TO

THE AGENT FORTHWITH ON DEMAND SUCH AMOUNT DISTRIBUTED TO SUCH LENDER

TOGETHER WITH INTEREST THEREON, FOR EACH DAY FROM THE DATE SUCH AMOUNT IS

DISTRIBUTED TO SUCH LENDER UNTIL THE DATE SUCH LENDER REPAYS SUCH AMOUNT TO

THE AGENT, AT THE FEDERAL FUNDS RATE.

146

147

2.17 SHARING OF PAYMENTS, ETC.  IF ANY LENDER OBTAINS ANY PAYMENT (WHETHER

VOLUNTARY, INVOLUNTARY, THROUGH THE EXERCISE OF ANY RIGHT OF SET-OFF, OR

OTHERWISE) ON ACCOUNT OF THE COMMITTED ADVANCES MADE BY IT (OTHER THAN

PURSUANT TO SECTIONS 2.9, 2.13, 2.14, 2.15 OR 2.19), IN EXCESS OF ITS

RATABLE SHARE OF PAYMENTS ON ACCOUNT OF THE COMMITTED ADVANCES OBTAINED BY

ALL THE LENDERS, SUCH LENDER SHALL FORTHWITH PURCHASE FROM THE OTHER

LENDERS SUCH PARTICIPATIONS IN THE COMMITTED ADVANCES MADE BY THEM AS SHALL

BE NECESSARY TO CAUSE SUCH PURCHASING LENDER TO SHARE THE EXCESS PAYMENT

RATABLY WITH EACH OF THEM, PROVIDED, HOWEVER, THAT IF ALL OR ANY PORTION OF

SUCH EXCESS PAYMENT IS THEREAFTER RECOVERED FROM SUCH PURCHASING LENDER,

SUCH PURCHASE FROM EACH OTHER LENDER SHALL BE RESCINDED AND EACH SUCH OTHER

LENDER SHALL REPAY TO THE PURCHASING LENDER THE PURCHASE PRICE TO THE

EXTENT OF SUCH RECOVERY TOGETHER WITH AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO SUCH LENDER'S

RATABLE SHARE (ACCORDING TO THE PROPORTION OF (I) THE AMOUNT OF SUCH

LENDER'S REQUIRED REPAYMENT TO (II) THE TOTAL AMOUNT SO RECOVERED FROM THE

PURCHASING LENDER) OF ANY INTEREST OR OTHER AMOUNT PAID OR PAYABLE BY THE

PURCHASING LENDER IN RESPECT OF THE TOTAL AMOUNT SO RECOVERED.  THE

BORROWERS AGREE THAT ANY LENDER SO PURCHASING A PARTICIPATION FROM ANOTHER

LENDER PURSUANT TO THIS SECTION 2.17 MAY, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED

BY LAW, EXERCISE ALL ITS RIGHTS OF PAYMENT (INCLUDING THE RIGHT OF SET-OFF)

WITH RESPECT TO SUCH PARTICIPATION AS FULLY AS IF SUCH LENDER WERE A

CREDITOR OF THE BORROWERS IN THE AMOUNT OF SUCH PARTICIPATION.

ACCORDANCE WITH ITS USUAL PRACTICE AN ACCOUNT OR ACCOUNTS EVIDENCING THE

ENFORCEMENT OR OTHERWISE) THE COMMITTED ADVANCES OWING TO, OR TO BE MADE

BY, SUCH LENDER, SUCH BORROWER SHALL PROMPTLY EXECUTE AND DELIVER TO SUCH

LENDER A COMMITTED NOTE PAYABLE TO THE ORDER OF SUCH LENDER IN A PRINCIPAL

LONG-TERM SENIOR UNSECURED NON-CREDIT-ENHANCED DEBT RATINGS FROM MOODY'S

AND S&P; ARE BETTER THAN OR EQUAL TO A3 AND A-, RESPECTIVELY.  THE COMPANY

MAY OFFER THE INCREASES TO
