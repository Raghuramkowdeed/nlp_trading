RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS FOR

EACH OF THE MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ON PAGES 19-36.

COMPETITION

THE COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT MARKET AND THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REMAIN EXTREMELY

COMPETITIVE. WE FACE AGGRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS, INCLUDING AIRBUS, WHO ARE INTENT ON INCREASING THEIR MARKET SHARE. WE ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OUR PROCESSES AND CONTINUING COST REDUCTION EFFORTS. WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE OUR EXTENSIVE

CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES NETWORK WHICH INCLUDES AVIATION SUPPORT, SPARES, TRAINING, MAINTENANCE DOCUMENTS AND TECHNICAL ADVICE FOR AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO PROVIDE A HIGHER LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND PRODUCTIVITY.

IDS FACES STRONG COMPETITION IN ALL MARKET SEGMENTS, PRIMARILY FROM LOCKHEED MARTIN,

NORTHROP GRUMMAN, RAYTHEON AND GENERAL DYNAMICS. NON-U.S. COMPANIES SUCH AS BAE SYSTEMS AND EUROPEAN AERONAUTIC DEFENCE AND SPACE COMPANY CONTINUE TO BUILD A STRATEGIC PRESENCE IN THE U.S. MARKET BY STRENGTHENING THEIR NORTH AMERICAN OPERATIONS AND

PARTNERING WITH U.S. DEFENSE COMPANIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REGULATORY MATTERS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED IN MOST OF OUR MARKETS. WE DEAL WITH NUMEROUS U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND ENTITIES,

INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALL OF THE BRANCHES OF THE U.S. MILITARY, NASA, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. SIMILAR GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES EXIST IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS, MAY TERMINATE ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AT THEIR CONVENIENCE AS WELL AS FOR DEFAULT

BASED ON OUR FAILURE TO MEET SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS. IF ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WERE TO BE TERMINATED FOR CONVENIENCE, WE GENERALLY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PAYMENT FOR WORK COMPLETED AND ALLOWABLE TERMINATION OR CANCELLATION

COSTS. IF ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WERE TO BE TERMINATED FOR DEFAULT, GENERALLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD PAY ONLY FOR THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AND CAN REQUIRE US TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT PRICE AND THE COST

TO RE-PROCURE THE CONTRACT ITEMS, NET OF THE WORK ACCEPTED FROM THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN ALSO HOLD US LIABLE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE DEFAULT.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.

IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION

REGULATIONS GOVERNING PRODUCTION AND QUALITY SYSTEMS, AIRWORTHINESS AND INSTALLATION APPROVALS, REPAIR PROCEDURES AND CONTINUING OPERATIONAL SAFETY. INTERNATIONALLY, SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS EXIST FOR AIRWORTHINESS, INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONAL

APPROVALS. THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE GENERALLY ADMINISTERED BY THE NATIONAL AVIATION AUTHORITIES OF EACH COUNTRY AND, IN THE CASE OF EUROPE, COORDINATED BY THE EUROPEAN JOINT AVIATION AUTHORITIES.

ENVIRONMENTAL.

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO AND AFFECTED BY A VARIETY OF

FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE DISCHARGE, TREATMENT, STORAGE, DISPOSAL, INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION OF CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUBSTANCES AND WASTES. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OUR COMPLIANCE STATUS AND

MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS TO ENSURE OUR OPERATIONS ARE IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF SITES ARE A NORMAL, RECURRING PART OF OUR OPERATIONS. THESE COSTS OFTEN

ARE ALLOWABLE COSTS UNDER OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT CONTINUED ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR CASH FLOWS IF MORE STRINGENT

CLEAN-UP STANDARDS ARE IMPOSED, ADDITIONAL CONTAMINATION IS DISCOVERED AND/OR CLEAN-UP COSTS ARE HIGHER THAN ESTIMATED.

A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY (PRP) HAS JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY UNDER EXISTING U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WHERE WE HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED A PRP BY THE

ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY OR A STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY, WE ARE POTENTIALLY LIABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT OR THIRD PARTIES FOR THE FULL COST OF REMEDIATING CONTAMINATION AT OUR FACILITIES OR FORMER FACILITIES OR AT THIRD-PARTY SITES. IF WE WERE

REQUIRED TO FULLY FUND THE REMEDIATION OF A SITE, THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK WOULD ALLOW US TO PURSUE RIGHTS TO CONTRIBUTION FROM OTHER PRPS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES, SEE NOTE 13.

INTERNATIONAL.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. AND NON-U.S.

GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AND PROCUREMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES, INCLUDING REGULATIONS RELATING TO IMPORT-EXPORT CONTROL, INVESTMENT, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. INTERNATIONAL SALES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO VARYING CURRENCY, POLITICAL

AND ECONOMIC RISKS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RAW MATERIALS

WE ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ESSENTIAL MATERIALS, PARTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS. THE MOST IMPORTANT RAW MATERIALS

REQUIRED FOR OUR AEROSPACE PRODUCTS ARE ALUMINUM (SHEET, PLATE, FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS), TITANIUM (SHEET, PLATE, FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS) AND COMPOSITES (INCLUDING CARBON AND BORON). ALTHOUGH ALTERNATIVE SOURCES GENERALLY EXIST FOR THESE RAW

MATERIALS, QUALIFICATION OF THE SOURCES COULD TAKE A YEAR OR MORE. MANY MAJOR COMPONENTS AND PRODUCT EQUIPMENT ITEMS ARE PROCURED OR SUBCONTRACTED ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS WITH A NUMBER OF DOMESTIC AND NON-U.S. COMPANIES.

SUPPLIERS

WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY OF LARGE NUMBERS OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO MEET PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS, QUALITY

STANDARDS AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES AT ANTICIPATED COSTS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN AN EXTENSIVE QUALIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO CONTROL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES, FAILURE OF SUPPLIERS OR SUBCONTRACTORS TO MEET

COMMITMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AND PROGRAM/CONTRACT PROFITABILITY, THEREBY JEOPARDIZING OUR ABILITY TO FULFILL COMMITMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ARE ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY SOURCES, SUCH AS ELECTRICITY,

AT AFFORDABLE PRICES.

OTHER INFORMATION

BOEING WAS ORIGINALLY INCORPORATED IN THE STATE OF WASHINGTON IN 1916 AND

REINCORPORATED IN DELAWARE IN 1934. OUR PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE OFFICES ARE LOCATED AT 100 N. RIVERSIDE, CHICAGO, ILLINOIS 60606 AND OUR TELEPHONE NUMBER IS (312) 544-2000.

GENERAL INFORMATION ABOUT US CAN BE FOUND AT WWW.BOEING.COM. THE INFORMATION CONTAINED ON OR CONNECTED TO OUR WEB SITE IS NOT

INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE INTO THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K AND SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED PART OF THIS OR ANY OTHER REPORT FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC). OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q AND

CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, AS WELL AS ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS, ARE AVAILABLE FREE OF CHARGE THROUGH OUR WEB SITE AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER WE FILE THEM WITH, OR FURNISH THEM TO, THE SEC. THESE REPORTS MAY ALSO BE OBTAINED AT

THE SECS PUBLIC REFERENCE ROOM AT 450 FIFTH STREET, N.W., WASHINGTON, DC 20549. THE SEC ALSO MAINTAINS A WEB SITE AT WWW.SEC.GOV THAT CONTAINS REPORTS, PROXY STATEMENTS AND OTHER INFORMATION REGARDING SEC REGISTRANTS, INCLUDING BOEING.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

AN INVESTMENT

IN OUR COMMON STOCK OR DEBT SECURITIES INVOLVES RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND OUR ACTUAL RESULTS AND FUTURE TRENDS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR PAST PERFORMANCE DUE TO A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE FOLLOWING.

WE DEPEND HEAVILY UPON COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS, OUR SUPPLIERS AND THE WORLDWIDE MARKET, WHICH ARE

SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS.

WE DERIVE A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINES, SOME OF WHICH HAVE ENCOUNTERED FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES.

WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THE MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINES. WE CAN MAKE NO

ASSURANCE THAT ANY CUSTOMER WILL PURCHASE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM US AFTER OUR CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER ENDS. FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, INCLUDING BANKRUPTCY, OF ANY OF THE MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINES COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR

REVENUES AND OUR OPPORTUNITY TO GENERATE A PROFIT. SEVERAL COMMERCIAL AIRLINES HAVE FILED FOR OR RECENTLY EMERGED FROM BANKRUPTCY.

5

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER AIRCRAFT ON TIME DEPENDS ON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO

UNIQUE RISKS.

OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER JET AIRCRAFT ON SCHEDULE IS DEPENDENT UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXECUTION OF INTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS, AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS (SUCH AS ALUMINUM, TITANIUM, AND COMPOSITES), INTERNAL AND

SUPPLIER PRODUCED PARTS AND STRUCTURES, CONVERSION OF RAW MATERIALS INTO PARTS AND ASSEMBLIES, PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AND REGULATORY CERTIFICATION. THE FAILURE OF ANY OR ALL OF THESE FACTORS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

OUT-OF-SEQUENCE WORK AND DISRUPTED PROCESS FLOWS THAT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT INEFFICIENCIES AND THAT ADVERSELY AFFECT PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AND PROGRAM/CONTRACT PROFITABILITY, THE LATTER THROUGH POSSIBLE CUSTOMER AND/OR SUPPLIER CLAIMS OR ASSERTIONS.

IN ADDITION, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND MAJOR DERIVATIVES INVOLVES INCREASED RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND CERTIFICATION SCHEDULES.

WE RELY ON MARKET CONDITIONS TO SELL AIRCRAFT INTO THE FUTURE.

THE WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT IS PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY LONG-TERM TRENDS IN AIRLINE PASSENGER TRAFFIC. THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS UNDERLYING LONG-TERM TRAFFIC GROWTH ARE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICAL STABILITY, BOTH IN

DEVELOPED AND EMERGING COUNTRIES. DEMAND FOR OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS FURTHER INFLUENCED BY AIRLINE INDUSTRY PROFITABILITY, WORLD TRADE POLICIES, GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, TERRORISM, DISEASE OUTBREAKS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED

UPON AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, PRICE AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS MAY REQUEST TO CANCEL, MODIFY OR RESCHEDULE ORDERS.

WE GENERALLY MAKE SALES UNDER PURCHASE ORDERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION, MODIFICATION OR RESCHEDULING.

CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY COULD RESULT IN CUSTOMER REQUESTS FOR RESCHEDULING OR CANCELLATION OF CONTRACTUAL ORDERS. IF THERE WERE SUCH CANCELLATIONS, MODIFICATION OR RESCHEDULING, IT

COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES.

OUR

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION RATES COULD CHANGE.

AS A RESULT OF WORLDWIDE DEMAND FOR NEW AIRCRAFT, WE HAVE RECEIVED MORE THAN ONE THOUSAND NET ORDERS PER YEAR DURING 2007, 2006 AND 2005. THERE MAY BE PRODUCTION RATE CHANGES IN ORDER TO MEET

THE DELIVERY SCHEDULES FOR EXISTING AND NEW AIRPLANE PROGRAMS. THIS MAY LEAD TO ADDING EXTRA PRODUCTION LINES, IMPLEMENTING INFRASTRUCTURE CHANGES, SEEKING ADDITIONAL QUALIFIED AND SKILLED EMPLOYEES, AND OBTAINING OTHER RESOURCES. FAILURE TO

SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ANY PRODUCTION RATE CHANGES COULD LEAD TO MISSED DELIVERY COMMITMENTS, AND DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF DELAY IN MEETING DELIVERY COMMITMENTS, ADDITIONAL COSTS AND CUSTOMERS RESCHEDULING THEIR DELIVERIES OR TERMINATING THEIR

AIRCRAFT ON CONTRACT WITH US.

WE DEPEND HEAVILY ON U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS,

WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS.

IN 2007, 42% OF OUR REVENUES

WERE DERIVED FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION TO NORMAL BUSINESS RISKS, OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

THE FUNDING OF U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IS SUBJECT TO CONGRESSIONAL

APPROPRIATIONS

. MANY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE MAY EXTEND FOR SEVERAL YEARS; HOWEVER, THESE PROGRAMS ARE NORMALLY FUNDED ANNUALLY. LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND RELATED ORDERS ARE SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION IF

APPROPRIATIONS FOR SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE PERIODS ARE NOT MADE. THE TERMINATION OF FUNDING FOR A U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAM WOULD RESULT IN A LOSS OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE REVENUES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THAT PROGRAM, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIALLY NEGATIVE

IMPACT ON OUR OPERATIONS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY

MODIFY, CURTAIL OR TERMINATE OUR CONTRACTS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY MODIFY, CURTAIL OR TERMINATE ITS CONTRACTS AND SUBCONTRACTS WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE AT ITS CONVENIENCE UPON PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COMMITMENTS MADE AT THE TIME OF TERMINATION.

MODIFICATION, CURTAILMENT OR TERMINATION OF OUR MAJOR PROGRAMS OR CONTRACTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR CONTRACT COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

. U.S. GOVERNMENT

REPRESENTATIVES MAY AUDIT THE COSTS WE INCUR ON OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, INCLUDING ALLOCATED INDIRECT COSTS. SUCH AUDITS COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR CONTRACT COSTS. ANY COSTS FOUND TO BE IMPROPERLY ALLOCATED TO A SPECIFIC CONTRACT WILL

NOT BE REIMBURSED, AND SUCH COSTS ALREADY REIMBURSED MUST BE REFUNDED. WE HAVE RECORDED CONTRACT REVENUES BASED UPON COSTS WE EXPECT TO REALIZE UPON FINAL AUDIT. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT KNOW THE OUTCOME OF ANY FUTURE AUDITS AND ADJUSTMENTS AND WE MAY BE

REQUIRED TO REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR PROFITS UPON COMPLETION AND FINAL NEGOTIATION OF AUDITS. IF ANY AUDIT UNCOVERS IMPROPER OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS, INCLUDING TERMINATION

OF CONTRACTS, FORFEITURE OF PROFITS, SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS, FINES AND SUSPENSION OR PROHIBITION FROM DOING BUSINESS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS.

WE ARE SOMETIMES SUBJECT TO CERTAIN U.S. GOVERNMENT

INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS PRACTICES DUE TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. ANY SUCH INQUIRY OR INVESTIGATION COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO

SPECIFIC PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS.

THESE REQUIREMENTS, ALTHOUGH CUSTOMARY IN U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, INCREASE OUR PERFORMANCE AND COMPLIANCE COSTS. THESE COSTS MIGHT INCREASE IN THE FUTURE, REDUCING OUR MARGINS, WHICH

COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS COULD LEAD TO SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT, FOR CAUSE, FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING OR SUBCONTRACTING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND COULD

HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO SECURE FUTURE U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

WE ENTER INTO FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS, WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO LOSSES IF WE HAVE COST OVERRUNS.

MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS IN IDS AND COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES ARE CONTRACTED ON A FIXED-PRICE BASIS. APPROXIMATELY 50% OF IDS REVENUES ARE GENERATED FROM FIXED-PRICE

CONTRACTS, AND COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT ARE NORMALLY SOLD ON A FIRM FIXED-PRICE BASIS WITH AN INDEXED PRICE ESCALATION CLAUSE. WHILE FIRM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS ALLOW US TO BENEFIT FROM COST SAVINGS, THEY ALSO EXPOSE US TO THE RISK OF COST OVERRUNS.

IF THE INITIAL ESTIMATES WE USE TO CALCULATE THE CONTRACT PRICE AND THE COST TO PERFORM THE WORK PROVE TO BE INCORRECT, WE COULD INCUR LOSSES. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR CONTRACTS HAVE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS RELATING TO COST, SCHEDULE, AND PERFORMANCE.

IF WE FAIL TO MEET THE TERMS SPECIFIED IN THOSE CONTRACTS, THEN OUR COST TO PERFORM THE WORK COULD INCREASE OR OUR PRICE COULD BE REDUCED, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE RISK FOR REACH-FORWARD LOSSES IF OUR

ESTIMATED COSTS EXCEED OUR ESTIMATED PRICE.

FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT WORK

INHERENTLY HAS MORE UNCERTAINTY THAN PRODUCTION CONTRACTS AND, THEREFORE, MORE VARIABILITY IN ESTIMATES OF THE COST TO COMPLETE THE WORK. MANY OF THESE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS HAVE VERY COMPLEX DESIGNS. AS TECHNICAL OR QUALITY ISSUES ARISE, WE MAY

EXPERIENCE SCHEDULE DELAYS AND COST IMPACTS, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR ESTIMATED COST TO PERFORM THE WORK OR REDUCE OUR ESTIMATED PRICE, EITHER OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHARGE. SOME FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS INCLUDE INITIAL

PRODUCTION UNITS IN THEIR SCOPE OF WORK. SUCCESSFUL PERFORMANCE OF THESE CONTRACTS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET PRODUCTION SPECIFICATIONS AND DELIVERY RATES. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO PERFORM AND DELIVER TO CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS, OUR CONTRACT PRICE

COULD BE REDUCED THROUGH THE INCORPORATION OF LIQUIDATED DAMAGES, TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT FOR DEFAULT, OR OTHER FINANCIALLY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE. MANAGEMENT USES ITS BEST JUDGMENT TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO PERFORM THE WORK AND THE PRICE WE WILL

EVENTUALLY BE PAID ON FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THE COST AND PRICE ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE, FUTURE EVENTS COULD RESULT IN EITHER UPWARD OR DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE ESTIMATES.

FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2006 WE RECORDED CHARGES OF $770 MILLION ON OUR AEW&C PROGRAM, DELAYED DELIVERY OF THE FIRST TWO AIRCRAFT AND REVISED THE DELIVERY SCHEDULE FOR THE REMAINING AIRCRAFT UNDER THIS PROGRAM. WE MAY CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TECHNICAL QUALITY ISSUES REQUIRING FURTHER DELAYS IN SCHEDULE OR REVISIONS TO OUR COST ESTIMATES. EXAMPLES OF OTHER SIGNIFICANT FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS

INCLUDE KC-767 TANKERS, COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY SATELLITES, VIGILARE AND HIGH FREQUENCY MODERNISATION.

WE ENTER INTO COST-TYPE CONTRACTS WHICH ALSO CARRY RISKS.

APPROXIMATELY 50% OF IDS REVENUES ARE GENERATED FROM COST-TYPE CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENTS. SOME OF THESE ARE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE COMPLEX DESIGN AND TECHNICAL CHALLENGES. THESE COST-TYPE PROGRAMS TYPICALLY HAVE AWARD

OR INCENTIVE FEES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY AND MAY BE EARNED OVER EXTENDED PERIODS. IN THESE CASES THE ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL RISKS ARE PRIMARILY IN LOWER PROFIT RATES OR PROGRAM CANCELLATION IF COST, SCHEDULE, OR TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUES

ARISE. PROGRAMS WHOSE CONTRACTS ARE PRIMARILY COST-TYPE INCLUDE GMD, FCS, P-8A POSEIDON, PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS, AIRBORNE LASER, JTRS, FAB-T, AND THE E/A-18G GROWLER.

WE ENTER INTO CONTRACTS THAT INCLUDE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THAT SUBJECT US TO RISKS.

CONTRACTS IN THE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE INDUSTRY INCLUDE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS,

AND GOVERNMENT SATELLITE CONTRACTS ALSO MAY INCLUDE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVES. THESE IN-ORBIT PAYMENTS MAY BE PAID OVER TIME AFTER FINAL SATELLITE ACCEPTANCE OR PAID IN FULL PRIOR TO FINAL SATELLITE ACCEPTANCE. IN BOTH CASES, THE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE

IS AT RISK IF THE SATELLITE DOES NOT PERFORM TO SPECIFICATIONS FOR UP TO 15 YEARS AFTER ACCEPTANCE. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE FEES WE ULTIMATELY EXPECT TO REALIZE IS RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE IN THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD.

IF THE SATELLITE FAILS TO MEET CONTRACTUAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, CUSTOMERS WILL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO CONTINUE MAKING IN-ORBIT PAYMENTS AND/OR WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE REFUNDS TO THE CUSTOMER AND INCUR SIGNIFICANT CHARGES.

WE USE ESTIMATES IN ACCOUNTING FOR MANY CONTRACTS AND PROGRAMS. CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES COULD

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

CONTRACT AND

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRE JUDGMENT RELATIVE TO ASSESSING RISKS, ESTIMATING CONTRACT REVENUES AND COSTS AND MAKING ASSUMPTIONS FOR SCHEDULE AND TECHNICAL ISSUES. DUE TO THE SIZE AND NATURE OF MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS AND PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATION OF

TOTAL REVENUES AND COST AT COMPLETION IS COMPLICATED AND SUBJECT TO MANY VARIABLES. ASSUMPTIONS HAVE TO BE MADE REGARDING THE LENGTH OF TIME TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACT OR PROGRAM BECAUSE COSTS ALSO INCLUDE EXPECTED INCREASES IN WAGES, MATERIALS PRICES

AND ALLOCATED FIXED COSTS. INCENTIVES OR PENALTIES RELATED TO PERFORMANCE ON CONTRACTS ARE CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING SALES AND PROFIT RATES, AND ARE RECORDED WHEN THERE IS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR US TO ASSESS ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE. ESTIMATES OF

AWARD FEES ARE ALSO USED IN SALES AND PROFIT RATES BASED ON ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED AWARDS.

UNDER PROGRAM ACCOUNTING, INVENTORIABLE PRODUCTION COSTS (INCLUDING OVERHEAD), PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED AND CHARGED AS COST OF SALES BY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF BY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR

CONTRACTS. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS LIMITED BY THE ABILITY TO MAKE

REASONABLE DEPENDABLE ESTIMATES. TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP OF SALES TO COST OF SALES, PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF (A) THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN A PROGRAM, (B) THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE UNITS CAN

REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED, AND (C) THE UNITS EXPECTED SALES PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING, AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM. SEVERAL FACTORS DETERMINE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, INCLUDING FIRM ORDERS,

LETTERS OF INTENT FROM PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS, AND MARKET STUDIES. SUCH ESTIMATES ARE RECONSIDERED THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF OUR PROGRAMS. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, CIRCUMSTANCES OR ESTIMATES CONCERNING THE SELECTION OF THE INITIAL ACCOUNTING

QUANTITY OR CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, ALONG WITH A FAILURE TO REALIZE PREDICTED COSTS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATION PROCESSES DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS LIKELY THAT MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT SALES AND PROFIT AMOUNTS COULD BE RECORDED IF WE USED DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR IF THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, CIRCUMSTANCES OR ESTIMATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE PERIOD FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR RECOGNIZING SALES AND PROFITS, SEE OUR DISCUSSION UNDER MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESCONTRACT ACCOUNTING/PROGRAM

ACCOUNTING ON PAGES 43-44 AND NOTE 1 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 53-54 OF THIS FORM 10-K.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DISCOUNT RATES, ACTUAL INVESTMENT RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS, AND OTHER FACTORS COULD AFFECT OUR EARNINGS, EQUITY, AND PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

OUR EARNINGS MAY BE POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED

BY THE AMOUNT OF INCOME OR EXPENSE WE RECORD FOR OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP) REQUIRE THAT WE CALCULATE INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR THE PLANS USING

ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. THESE VALUATIONS REFLECT ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO FINANCIAL MARKET AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS CAN CHANGE THE ASSUMPTIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT YEAR-END ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE PENSION

OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR THE FOLLOWING YEAR ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, AND EXPECTED FUTURE MEDICAL INFLATION. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF PLAN

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO EQUITY THROUGH A REDUCTION OR INCREASE TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING HOW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

PLAN ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIESPOSTRETIREMENT PLANS ON PAGES 46-47 OF THIS FORM 10-K. ALTHOUGH GAAP EXPENSE AND PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS

ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED, THE KEY ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT GAAP EXPENSE WOULD ALSO LIKELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CASH WE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. POTENTIAL PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDE BOTH MANDATORY AMOUNTS

REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AND DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO IMPROVE THE PLANS FUNDED STATUS.

SOME OF OUR WORKFORCE IS REPRESENTED BY LABOR UNIONS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO WORK STOPPAGES.

APPROXIMATELY 58,197 OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE UNIONIZED, WHICH REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 38% OF OUR EMPLOYEES AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. WE EXPERIENCED

WORK STOPPAGES IN 2005 WHEN LABOR STRIKES HALTED COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND IDS PRODUCTION AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL WORK STOPPAGES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW STABLE OUR RELATIONSHIPS,

CURRENTLY WITH 17 DIFFERENT U.S. LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND 7 DIFFERENT NON-U.S. LABOR ORGANIZATIONS, WILL BE OR WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THE UNIONS REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT IMPACTING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE UNIONS MAY ALSO LIMIT OUR

FLEXIBILITY IN DEALING WITH OUR WORKFORCE. WORK STOPPAGES AND INSTABILITY IN OUR UNION RELATIONSHIPS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE TIMELY PRODUCTION OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD STRAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND CAUSE A LOSS OF REVENUES THAT

WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

COMPETITION WITHIN OUR MARKETS

MAY REDUCE OUR PROCUREMENT OF FUTURE CONTRACTS AND SALES.

THE

MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE MORE EXTENSIVE OR MORE SPECIALIZED ENGINEERING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING CAPABILITIES THAN WE DO IN SOME AREAS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR LARGEST CUSTOMERS COULD DEVELOP

THE CAPABILITY TO MANUFACTURE PRODUCTS OR PROVIDE SERVICES SIMILAR TO PRODUCTS THAT WE MANUFACTURE OR SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE. THIS WOULD RESULT IN THESE CUSTOMERS SUPPLYING THEIR OWN PRODUCTS OR SERVICES AND COMPETING DIRECTLY WITH US FOR SALES OF

THESE PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, ALL OF WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES. FURTHERMORE, WE ARE FACING INCREASED INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION AND CROSS-BORDER CONSOLIDATION OF COMPETITION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE

SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST OUR CURRENT OR FUTURE COMPETITORS OR THAT THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WE FACE WILL NOT RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUES AND MARKET SHARE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM NON-U.S. SALES AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS IN OTHER

COUNTRIES.

IN 2007, SALES TO NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY 40% OF OUR REVENUES. WE EXPECT THAT NON-U.S. SALES WILL CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING.

·

CHANGES IN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS

·

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS TO EXPEND A PORTION OF PROGRAM FUNDS LOCALLY AND GOVERNMENTAL INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION REQUIREMENTS

·

FLUCTUATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES

·

DELAYS IN PLACING ORDERS

·

ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND CONDITIONS

WHILE THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE FACTORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.

THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION IN WHICH WE HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IS UNPREDICTABLE AND AN

ADVERSE DECISION IN ANY SUCH MATTER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE DEFENDANTS IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS. THESE CLAIMS MAY DIVERT FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE USED TO BENEFIT OUR

OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE MERITORIOUS DEFENSES TO THE CLAIMS, NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE RESULTS OF THESE MATTERS WILL BE FAVORABLE TO US. AN ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THESE LAWSUITS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

AFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

A SUBSTANTIAL

DETERIORATION IN THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY AS IT RELATES TO BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

BCC, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, HAS A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS PORTFOLIO

CONCENTRATED AMONG COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS. A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT DEFAULTS BY AIRLINE CUSTOMERS, REPOSSESSIONS OF AIRCRAFT, AIRLINE BANKRUPTCIES, OR RESTRUCTURINGS. BANKRUPTCIES OR

RESTRUCTURINGS OF OUR CURRENT OR POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS COULD LEAD TO REDUCED DEMAND FOR LEASED AIRCRAFT AND REDUCED AIRCRAFT LEASE RATES AND AIRCRAFT VALUES. THESE EVENTS COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL

POSITION.

WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES/STRATEGIC ALLIANCES OR DIVESTITURES.

AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE ACQUIRE BUSINESSES AND FORM JOINT

VENTURES/STRATEGIC ALLIANCES. WHETHER WE REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL DEPEND IN PART UPON THE INTEGRATION OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE ACQUIRED PRODUCTS, CAPABILITIES OR TECHNOLOGIES AND THE

MANAGEMENT OF STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED FROM TRANSACTION-RELATED CHARGES, AMORTIZATION OF EXPENSES RELATED TO INTANGIBLES, CHARGES FOR IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-TERM ASSETS, CREDIT GUARANTEES

AND INDEMNIFICATIONS. CONSOLIDATIONS OF JOINT VENTURES COULD ALSO IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED APPROPRIATE AND ADEQUATE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS, THERE IS

NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. DIVESTITURES MAY RESULT IN CONTINUED FINANCIAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES, SUCH AS THROUGH GUARANTEES OR OTHER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS, FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTION. NONPERFORMANCE BY

THOSE DIVESTED BUSINESSES COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR INSURANCE

COVERAGE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER ALL SIGNIFICANT RISK EXPOSURES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO LIABILITIES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE PROVIDE. WHILE WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN RISKS AND, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MAY RECEIVE INDEMNIFICATION FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, INSURANCE CANNOT BE

OBTAINED TO PROTECT AGAINST ALL RISKS AND LIABILITIES. IT IS THEREFORE POSSIBLE THAT THE AMOUNT OF OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT COVER ALL CLAIMS OR LIABILITIES, AND WE MAY BE FORCED TO BEAR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS.

OUR FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS, PROJECTIONS AND BUSINESS ASSUMPTIONS MAY PROVE TO BE INACCURATE,

RESULTING IN LOWER THAN EXPECTED EARNINGS.

THE STATEMENTS IN

THIS RISK FACTORS SECTION DESCRIBE MATERIAL RISKS TO OUR BUSINESS AND SHOULD BE CONSIDERED CAREFULLY. IN ADDITION, THESE STATEMENTS CONSTITUTE OUR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS UNDER THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. OUR DISCLOSURE AND

ITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

CURRENTLY,

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS. FOR A DISCUSSION OF CONTINGENCIES RELATED TO LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, SEE NOTE 21 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH IS HEREBY INCORPORATED BY REFERENCE.

WE POSSESS A NATIONAL POLLUTANT DISCHARGE ELIMINATION SYSTEM (NPDES) PERMIT, ISSUED BY

THE CALIFORNIA REGIONAL WATER QUALITY CONTROL BOARD, LOS ANGELES REGION (REGIONAL BOARD), WHICH SETS LIMITS ON THE PERMISSIBLE LEVEL OF CERTAIN CONSTITUENTS IN SURFACE WATER DISCHARGED FROM VARIOUS OUTFALLS AT OUR SANTA SUSANA FIELD LABORATORY

(SSFL) SITE IN SIMI VALLEY, CALIFORNIA. SINCE JUNE 2004, THE REGIONAL BOARD HAS AMENDED THIS PERMIT TO IMPOSE INCREASINGLY STRINGENT NUMERIC LIMITS. IN LATE 2006, THE CALIFORNIA WATER RESOURCES CONTROL BOARD (STATE BOARD) PARTIALLY GRANTED AND

PARTIALLY DENIED THE

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPANYS APPEAL OF THESE AMENDMENTS, AND REMANDED THE PERMIT TO THE REGIONAL BOARD TO CORRECT CERTAIN ERRORS. ON JANUARY 17, 2007, WE FILED AN ACTION IN LOS

ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT CHALLENGING THE STATE BOARDS RULINGS THAT ARE ADVERSE TO THE COMPANY, INCLUDING THE DETERMINATION TO UPHOLD THE MORE STRINGENT NUMERIC LIMITS IN THE PERMIT, AND THAT MATTER REMAINS PENDING.

ON NOVEMBER 1, 2007, THE REGIONAL BOARD RESPONDED TO THE REMAND FROM THE STATE

BOARD BY AMENDING THE PERMIT, AND ISSUING A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER INCORPORATING SOME (BUT NOT ALL) RELIEF THAT WE HAD REQUESTED. ON DECEMBER 3, 2007, WE FILED AN ADMINISTRATIVE APPEAL OF CERTAIN PORTIONS OF THE REGIONAL BOARDS

NOVEMBER 1ST ACTION, BUT ASKED THAT THE STATE BOARD HOLD THE APPEAL IN ABEYANCE AS WE SEEK TO WORK COOPERATIVELY WITH THE REGIONAL BOARD TO ADDRESS CONTINUING PERMIT COMPLIANCE ISSUES.

DURING THE PERIOD FROM JANUARY 2004 TO THE PRESENT, WE HAVE RECEIVED FIVE VIOLATION

NOTICES FROM THE REGIONAL BOARD FOR DISCHARGING SURFACE WATER EXCEEDING CERTAIN OF THE PERMIT LIMITS. ON AUGUST 27, 2007, WE ENTERED INTO AN ADMINISTRATIVE SETTLEMENT WITH THE REGIONAL BOARD UNDER WHICH WE PAID $235,595 IN CIVIL PENALTIES AND

$235,595 TO FUND SUPPLEMENTAL ENVIRONMENTAL PROJECTS, FOR A TOTAL COST OF $0.471 MILLION. THIS RESOLUTION ADDRESSED MOST BUT NOT ALL OF THE INCIDENTS CITED IN THE VIOLATION NOTICES, AND ADDITIONAL ADMINISTRATIVE OR OTHER ACTION IS STILL POSSIBLE.

IN NOVEMBER 2005, WE RECEIVED A GRAND JURY SUBPOENA FROM THE U.S.

ATTORNEYS OFFICE IN LOS ANGELES SEEKING DOCUMENTS FROM 2001 ONWARD PERTAINING TO OUR NPDES PERMIT COMPLIANCE STATUS UNDER THE FEDERAL CLEAN WATER ACT (CWA). WE MAINTAIN THAT NO CRIMINAL VIOLATIONS OF THE CWA HAVE OCCURRED AND THAT THE

INCIDENTS ARE BEING APPROPRIATELY ADDRESSED BY CIVIL ADMINISTRATIVE ACTIONS UNDERTAKEN BY THE REGIONAL BOARD. WE HAVE PRODUCED THE DOCUMENTS REQUESTED BY THE SUBPOENA, AND MADE OUR LAST SUBMISSION IN FEBRUARY 2007. NO FURTHER ACTION HAS BEEN TAKEN

BY THE U.S. ATTORNEYS OFFICE.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

OVERVIEW

WE ARE A GLOBAL MARKET LEADER IN DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURE, SALE AND SUPPORT OF COMMERCIAL JETLINERS, MILITARY AIRCRAFT, SATELLITES, MISSILE DEFENSE, HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT AND LAUNCH SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. WE ARE ONE OF THE

TWO MAJOR MANUFACTURERS OF 100+ SEAT AIRPLANES FOR THE WORLDWIDE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY AND THE SECOND-LARGEST DEFENSE CONTRACTOR IN THE U.S. WHILE OUR PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS ARE IN THE U.S., WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON A NETWORK OF PARTNERS, KEY

SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS LOCATED AROUND THE WORLD.

OUR BUSINESS

STRATEGY IS CENTERED ON SUCCESSFUL EXECUTION IN HEALTHY CORE BUSINESSES  COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES AND INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS (IDS)  SUPPLEMENTED AND SUPPORTED BY BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION (BCC). TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE CORE BUSINESSES

GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW THAT PERMIT US TO INVEST IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT OPEN NEW FRONTIERS IN AEROSPACE. WE FOCUS ON PRODUCING THE AIRPLANES THE MARKET DEMANDS AND WE PRICE OUR PRODUCTS TO PROVIDE A FAIR RETURN FOR OUR

SHAREHOLDERS WHILE CONTINUING TO FIND NEW WAYS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY. IDS INTEGRATES ITS RESOURCES IN DEFENSE, INTELLIGENCE, COMMUNICATIONS AND SPACE TO DELIVER CAPABILITY-DRIVEN SOLUTIONS TO ITS CUSTOMERS AT REDUCED COSTS. OUR STRATEGY

IS TO LEVERAGE OUR CORE BUSINESSES TO CAPTURE KEY NEXT-GENERATION PROGRAMS WHILE EXPANDING OUR PRESENCE IN ADJACENT AND INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, UNDERSCORED BY AN INTENSE FOCUS ON GROWTH AND PRODUCTIVITY. OUR STRATEGY ALSO BENEFITS AS COMMERCIAL AND

DEFENSE MARKETS OFTEN OFFSET EACH OTHERS CYCLICALITY. BCC DELIVERS VALUE THROUGH SUPPORTING OUR BUSINESS UNITS AND MANAGING OVERALL FINANCING EXPOSURE.

IN 2007, OUR REVENUES GREW BY 8%. EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED 93%. WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN KEY GROWTH PROGRAMS AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE GREW BY

18% TO $3.9 BILLION, REFLECTING INCREASED SPENDING ON THE 787 AND 747-8 PROGRAMS AND LOWER COST SHARING PAYMENTS FROM SUPPLIERS. WE GENERATED OPERATING CASH FLOW OF $9.6 BILLION DRIVEN BY OPERATING AND WORKING CAPITAL PERFORMANCE. WE REDUCED DEBT BY

$1.3 BILLION AND REPURCHASED 29 MILLION COMMON SHARES. OUR CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG GREW 37% TO $297 BILLION, DRIVEN BY 46% GROWTH AT COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES WHILE OUR TOTAL BACKLOG GREW 31% TO $327 BILLION.

WE EXPECT CONTINUED GROWTH IN COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE REVENUES AND DELIVERIES AS WE EXECUTE

OUR RECORD BACKLOG AND RESPOND TO GLOBAL DEMAND BY RAMPING UP COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION. WE EXPECT IDS REVENUE TO REMAIN RELATIVELY FLAT IN 2008 COMPARED WITH 2007 AND ANTICIPATE THAT THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (U.S. DOD) BUDGET GROWTH WILL

BEGIN TO MODERATE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. WE ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PRODUCTIVITY AND CUSTOMER-FOCUSED GROWTH.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REVENUES IN 2007 GREW BY $4,857 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE GROWTH AT COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

REVENUES INCREASED BY $4,921 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NEW AIRPLANE DELIVERIES AND INCREASED COMMERCIAL AVIATION SUPPORT ACTIVITIES. IDS REVENUES DECREASED BY $359 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES IN NETWORK AND SPACE SYSTEMS

(N&SS) RESULTING FROM THE FORMATION OF THE UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE (ULA) JOINT VENTURE IN 2006 AND LOWER REVENUES IN PRECISION ENGAGEMENT AND MOBILITY SYSTEMS (PE&MS), OFFSET BY GROWTH IN SUPPORT SYSTEMS. BCC REVENUES DECREASED BY $210

MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE CUSTOMER FINANCING PORTFOLIO. ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS CHANGED BY $524 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO FEWER COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES INTERCOMPANY DELIVERIES WHEN COMPARED WITH 2006.

HIGHER CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2006 WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NEW COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES. IDS REVENUES WERE UP MODERATELY IN 2006 AS GROWTH IN PE&MS AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VOLUME IN N&SS. BCC REVENUES INCREASED IN 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER INVESTMENT INCOME AND HIGHER NET GAIN ON

DISPOSAL OF ASSETS. OTHER SEGMENT REVENUES DECREASED IN 2006 AS A RESULT OF THE BUYOUT OF SEVERAL OPERATING LEASE AIRCRAFT IN THE AMOUNT OF $369 MILLION IN 2005. ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS DECREASED REVENUES DUE TO HIGHER COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANES INTERCOMPANY DELIVERIES IN 2006.

OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2007

IMPROVED BY $2,816 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2006. THE INCREASE IS PARTLY DUE TO THE $571 MILLION GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE (U.S. DOJ) THAT OCCURRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES EARNINGS INCREASED BY

$851 MILLION COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD IN 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NEW AIRPLANE DELIVERIES, COMMERCIAL AVIATION SUPPORT ACTIVITIES AND IMPROVED COST PERFORMANCE OFFSET BY INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE INCREASED BY $572 MILLION TO $2,962 MILLION COMPARED WITH THE SAME PERIOD 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO SPENDING ON THE 787 AND 747-8 PROGRAMS. IDS EARNINGS INCREASED BY $408 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2006. THE

INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO 2006 CHARGES OF $770 MILLION IN THE PE&MS SEGMENT RELATED TO AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING & CONTROL (AEW&C), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER 2007 EARNINGS ON SEVERAL PROGRAMS IN THE PE&MS AND N&SS SEGMENTS.

BCC OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED $57 MILLION REFLECTING LOWER REVENUES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A RECOVERY OF LOSSES AND LOWER EXPENSES. OTHER SEGMENT EARNINGS IMPROVED BY $495 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF LOSSES RELATED TO CONNEXION BY

BOEING, WHICH INCLUDED A CHARGE OF $320 MILLION TO EXIT THIS BUSINESS IN 2006. LOWER UNALLOCATED EXPENSE IN 2007 CONTRIBUTED $548 MILLION TO THE 2007 EARNINGS IMPROVEMENT.

OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY IMPROVED EARNINGS AT COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES RESULTING FROM HIGHER REVENUE

FROM NEW AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES, INCREASED EARNINGS FROM COMMERCIAL AVIATION SUPPORT BUSINESS AND IMPROVED COST PERFORMANCE. LOWER UNALLOCATED EXPENSE IN 2006 ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE 2006 EARNINGS INCREASE. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $571 MILLION

CHARGE FOR

WE RECORDED NET PERIODIC BENEFIT

COST RELATED TO PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OF $1,773 MILLION, $1,663 MILLION AND $1,852 MILLION IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. NOT ALL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD INCURRED BECAUSE IT IS

ALLOCATED TO PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT COSTS AND A PORTION REMAINS IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS INCLUDED $1,730 MILLION, $1,227 MILLION AND $1,893 MILLION IN 2007, 2006, AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. A

PORTION OF PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE IS RECORDED IN THE BUSINESS SEGMENTS AND THE REMAINDER IS INCLUDED IN UNALLOCATED PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE.

UNALLOCATED PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COSTS RECOGNIZED UNDER GAAP IN THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FEDERAL COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS REQUIRED TO BE UTILIZED BY OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING PURPOSES.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE INCREASED DURING 2007 WHEN COMPARED WITH 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED OVERALL PENSION COSTS RECOGNIZED IN INVENTORY AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2006, WHICH ARE SUBSEQUENTLY EXPENSED IN COST OF SALES IN 2007. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE DECREASED IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 MAINLY DUE TO AN ABSENCE OF NET SETTLEMENT AND CURTAILMENT CHARGES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

AN INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF ACTUARIAL LOSS THAT WAS AMORTIZED.

THE

REDUCTION IN SHARE-BASED PLANS EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER PERFORMANCE SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING 2007 AND HIGHER EXPENSE ACCELERATION DURING 2006, RESULTING FROM 12 PAYOUTS COMPARED WITH SIX PAYOUTS IN 2007. THE DECREASE IN 2006 SHARE-BASED

PLANS EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE INCREASE IN OUR STOCK PRICE DURING 2005 WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PERFORMANCE SHARES MEETING THE PRICE GROWTH TARGETS AND BEING CONVERTED TO COMMON

STOCK. THE YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGES IN DEFERRED COMPENSATION EXPENSE ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN OUR STOCK PRICE. OTHER EXPENSE DECREASED IN 2007 PARTLY DUE TO REDUCED INTERCOMPANY PROFIT ELIMINATION AS A RESULT OF FEWER INTERCOMPANY DELIVERIES

DURING 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006.

OTHER INCOME, WHICH PRIMARILY

CONSISTS OF INTEREST INCOME, WAS HIGHER IN 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 AS A RESULT OF INCREASES IN AVERAGE PRINCIPAL BALANCES AND HIGHER AVERAGE RATES OF RETURN ON CASH AND INVESTMENTS. OTHER INCOME WAS HIGHER IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 AS A RESULT OF

INCREASES IN AVERAGE PRINCIPAL BALANCES AND HIGHER AVERAGE RATES OF RETURN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST INCOME COMPARED WITH 2005 RELATED TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX SETTLEMENTS FOR PRIOR YEARS.

INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE DECREASED IN 2007 AND IN 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO DEBT

REPAYMENTS.

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 33.7% FOR 2007 DIFFERED

FROM THE 2006 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 30.9% PRIMARILY DUE TO FOREIGN SALES CORPORATION AND EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME EXCLUSION TAX BENEFITS THAT EXISTED IN 2006, BUT DID NOT RECUR IN 2007. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NON-DEDUCTION IN 2006 OF

THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH THE U.S. DOJ AND OTHER INCOME TAX PROVISION ADJUSTMENTS. THE 2007 TAX RATE OF 33.7% INCLUDED ENHANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDITS THAT EXCEEDED THE CREDITS IN 2006. THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 30.9% FOR 2006

DIFFERED FROM THE 2005 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 9.1% PRIMARILY DUE TO THE FAVORABLE 2005 SETTLEMENT WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE AND THE NON-DEDUCTION IN 2006 OF THE GLOBAL SETTLEMENT WITH THE U.S. DOJ. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION RELATED TO

INCOME TAXES SEE NOTE 4.

BACKLOG

CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG OF UNFILLED ORDERS EXCLUDES PURCHASE OPTIONS, ANNOUNCED ORDERS FOR

WHICH DEFINITIVE CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED, AND UNOBLIGATED U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACT FUNDING. CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG INCREASED BY $80,397 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED TO 2006 AS A RESULT OF INCREASES AT COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES OF $80,900

MILLION, WHICH WERE DUE TO NEW ORDERS IN EXCESS OF DELIVERIES FOR ALL PROGRAMS OFFSET BY DECREASES AT IDS OF $503 MILLION.

UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG INCLUDES U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFINITIVE CONTRACTS FOR WHICH FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN AUTHORIZED. FUNDING THAT IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECEIVED IS

MOVED TO CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG. THE DECREASE IN IDS UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG OF $3,502 MILLION DURING 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO FUNDING RELEASED FROM EXISTING CONTRACTS ON FUTURE COMBAT SYSTEMS (FCS), PROPRIETARY, C-17, P8-A AND F-18,

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASES IN THE F-22 PROGRAM AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

AIRLINE INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT

THE FUNDAMENTAL DRIVERS OF AIR TRAVEL GROWTH ARE A COMBINATION OF ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE INCREASING PROPENSITY TO TRAVEL DUE TO INCREASED TRADE, GLOBALIZATION AND

IMPROVED AIRLINE SERVICES DRIVEN BY LIBERALIZATION OF AIR TRAFFIC RIGHTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES. AIR TRAFFIC GROWTH CONTINUES TO EXCEED ITS LONG-TERM TREND DUE TO STRONG PERFORMANCE OF THESE KEY DRIVERS. GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH, THE PRIMARY DRIVER OF AIR

TRAFFIC GROWTH, REMAINED ABOVE LONG-TERM TREND FOR THE FOURTH STRAIGHT YEAR IN 2007. THE WORLD ECONOMY HAS GROWN AT AN AVERAGE 3.8% ANNUAL RATE SINCE 2004 COMPARED TO THE LONG-TERM TREND RATE OF 3.1%. THE INCREASINGLY DIVERSIFIED WORLD ECONOMY IS

FORECAST TO CONTINUE ABOVE-TREND GROWTH THROUGH THE END OF THE DECADE ALTHOUGH THERE IS INCREASED UNCERTAINTY IN THE NEAR-TERM OUTLOOK DUE TO A SLOWDOWN IN THE UNITED STATES ECONOMY.

INCREASINGLY LIBERALIZED AND COMPETITIVE AIR TRAVEL MARKETS ARE ALSO SUPPORTING STRONG TRAFFIC GROWTH. MANY BILATERAL AIR SERVICE

AGREEMENTS GOVERNING AIR TRAFFIC RIGHTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES ARE LIBERALIZING AIR TRAVEL AROUND THE WORLD PARTICULARLY IN HIGH GROWTH MARKETS SUCH AS CHINA AND INDIA WHICH HAVE SIGNED MULTIPLE NEW AGREEMENTS OVER THE LAST SEVERAL YEARS. IN ADDITION,

OPEN SKIES AGREEMENTS, IN WHICH ALL TRAFFIC RIGHTS RESTRICTIONS ARE ELIMINATED, CONTINUE TO EMERGE WITH UNITED STATES  EUROPEAN UNION OPEN SKIES NEGOTIATIONS BEING THE MOST PROMINENT RECENT EXAMPLE. AIRLINE OWNERSHIP IS ALSO BECOMING MORE

COMMERCIALLY DRIVEN  GOVERNMENTS ARE REDUCING OWNERSHIP AND CONTROL STAKES, MOVING AWAY FROM NATIONAL CARRIERS. ALL OF THESE FACETS OF LIBERALIZATION ARE INCREASING COMPETITION BETWEEN AIRLINES AND FURTHER STIMULATING DEMAND FOR AIR TRAVEL. IN

THIS INCREASINGLY LIBERALIZED ENVIRONMENT, AIRLINES ARE OFFERING IMPROVED SERVICE LEVELS INCREASING FLIGHT FREQUENCY AND AIRPORT PAIRS SERVED BY 5% PER YEAR SINCE 2004.

THE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO FUNDAMENTAL DRIVERS HAS LED TO A 9% ANNUAL AVERAGE INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF PASSENGERS SINCE 2003. IN

ADDITION, HIGH FUEL PRICES ARE SPURRING STRONG DEMAND TO REPLACE OLDER, LESS FUEL EFFICIENT AIRPLANES. TOGETHER, THESE TWO FACTORS HAVE LED TO STRONG DEMAND FOR NEW AIRCRAFT  OVER 7,000 ORDERS FOR LARGE COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT OVER THE LAST

FOUR YEARS, INCREASING INDUSTRY BACKLOG LEVELS TO SEVEN YEARS OF DELIVERIES AT CURRENT PRODUCTION RATES.

FUEL PRICES ARE ALSO PLAYING A KEY ROLE IN INCREASING THE CURRENT DEMAND FOR NEW AIRCRAFT. STRONG ECONOMIC GROWTH HAS ALSO LED TO SUSTAINED HIGH OIL AND FUEL PRICES. BETWEEN 2003 AND 2007, JET FUEL EXPENSE

GREW FROM 15 PERCENT TO MORE THAN 30 PERCENT OF AIRLINE OPERATING COSTS. AIRLINES ARE RESPONDING BY IMPROVING THE FUEL EFFICIENCY OF THEIR AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS AND REDUCING COST IN MANY OTHER AREAS. THEY ARE IMPLEMENTING MORE EFFICIENT (INTERNET

BASED) DISTRIBUTION SYSTEMS, REDUCING COMMISSION PAYMENTS, AND DRAWING ON THEIR EMPLOYEES FOR PARTICIPATION IN LABOR COST REDUCTION. THESE INITIATIVES, COMBINED WITH STRONG DEMAND, ARE ENABLING INDUSTRY-WIDE PROFITABILITY DESPITE HIGH FUEL PRICES.

WORLDWIDE AIRLINES ACHIEVED A $5.6 BILLION NET PROFIT IN 2007 AND ARE FORECAST TO EARN $5.0 BILLION IN 2008.

LOOKING FORWARD, OUR 20-YEAR FORECAST IS FOR A LONG-TERM AVERAGE GROWTH RATE OF 5% PER YEAR FOR PASSENGER TRAFFIC, AND 6% PER YEAR FOR CARGO TRAFFIC BASED ON PROJECTED AVERAGE ANNUAL WORLDWIDE

REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE OF 3%. BASED ON LONG-TERM GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH PROJECTIONS, AND FACTORING IN INCREASED UTILIZATION OF THE WORLDWIDE AIRPLANE FLEET AND REQUIREMENTS TO REPLACE OLDER AIRPLANES, WE PROJECT A $2.8 TRILLION MARKET FOR 28,600

NEW AIRPLANES OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS.

THE INDUSTRY REMAINS VULNERABLE TO

NEAR-TERM EXOGENOUS DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING DISEASE OUTBREAKS (SUCH AS AVIAN FLU), TERRORISM, GLOBAL ECONOMIC CYCLES, INCREASED GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS AND FUEL PRICES. FUEL PRICES ARE FORECAST TO REMAIN ELEVATED AND VOLATILE IN THE

NEAR-TERM DUE TO STRONG DEMAND DRIVEN BY ECONOMIC GROWTH AND HISTORICALLY LOW SURPLUS CAPACITY TO CUSHION AGAINST SUPPLY SHOCKS.

INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS

THE COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT MARKET AND THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REMAIN EXTREMELY

COMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT THE EXISTING LONG-TERM DOWNWARD TREND IN PASSENGER REVENUE YIELDS WORLDWIDE (MEASURED IN REAL TERMS) TO CONTINUE INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. MARKET LIBERALIZATION IN EUROPE AND ASIA HAS CONTINUED TO ENABLE LOW-COST AIRLINES

TO GAIN MARKET SHARE. THESE AIRLINES HAVE INCREASED THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON AIRFARES. THIS RESULTS IN CONTINUED COST PRESSURES FOR ALL AIRLINES AND PRICE PRESSURE ON OUR PRODUCTS. MAJOR PRODUCTIVITY GAINS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE A FAVORABLE MARKET

POSITION AT ACCEPTABLE PROFIT MARGINS.

CONTINUED ACCESS TO GLOBAL MARKETS

REMAINS VITAL TO OUR ABILITY TO FULLY REALIZE OUR SALES POTENTIAL AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT RETURNS. APPROXIMATELY TWO-THIRDS OF COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SALES AND CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG ARE DIRECTLY FROM CUSTOMERS BASED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE FACE AGGRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS WHO ARE INTENT ON

INCREASING THEIR MARKET SHARE. THEY OFFER COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND HAVE ACCESS TO MOST OF THE SAME CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. AIRBUS HAS HISTORICALLY INVESTED HEAVILY TO CREATE A FAMILY OF PRODUCTS TO COMPETE WITH OURS. REGIONAL JET MAKERS EMBRAER AND

BOMBARDIER, COMING FROM THE LESS THAN 100-SEAT COMMERCIAL JET MARKET, CONTINUE TO DEVELOP LARGER AND MORE CAPABLE AIRPLANES. ADDITIONALLY, OTHER COMPETITORS FROM RUSSIA, CHINA, AND JAPAN ARE LIKELY TO ENTER THE 70 TO 130 SEAT AIRCRAFT MARKET OVER

THE NEXT FEW YEARS. THIS MARKET ENVIRONMENT HAS RESULTED IN INTENSE PRESSURES ON PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

WORLDWIDE, AIRPLANE SALES ARE GENERALLY CONDUCTED IN U.S. DOLLARS. FLUCTUATING EXCHANGE RATES AFFECT THE PROFIT POTENTIAL OF OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS, ALL OF WHOM HAVE

SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN OTHER CURRENCIES. A DECLINE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO THEIR LOCAL CURRENCIES AS EXPERIENCED IN 2007 PUTS PRESSURE ON COMPETITORS REVENUES AND PROFITS. COMPETITORS OFTEN RESPOND BY AGGRESSIVELY REDUCING COSTS AND

INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY, THEREBY IMPROVING THEIR LONGER-TERM COMPETITIVE POSTURE. AIRBUS HAS RECENTLY ANNOUNCED SUCH INITIATIVES TARGETING A TWO-YEAR REDUCTION IN ITS DEVELOPMENT CYCLE AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY BY 2010. IF

THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS, AIRBUS CAN USE THE EXTRA EFFICIENCY TO DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS AND GAIN MARKET SHARE.

WE ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OUR PROCESSES AND CONTINUING COST-REDUCTION EFFORTS. WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE OUR EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES NETWORK WHICH INCLUDES AVIATION SUPPORT, SPARES, TRAINING,

MAINTENANCE DOCUMENTS AND TECHNICAL ADVICE FOR AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THIS ENABLES US TO PROVIDE A HIGHER LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND PRODUCTIVITY. THESE EFFORTS ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE PRICING STRATEGIES THAT ENABLE US TO PRICE

COMPETITIVELY AND MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY MARGINS.

THE INCREASE IN REVENUE OF $7,100 MILLION IN 2006 FROM 2005 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER NEW AIRPLANE

DELIVERIES, INCLUDING MODEL MIX CHANGES, OF $6,820 MILLION, INCREASED COMMERCIAL AVIATION SUPPORT BUSINESS OF $873 MILLION OFFSET BY $593 MILLION PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER REVENUE FROM AIRCRAFT TRADING. IN 2005 WE DELIVERED 29 FEWER THAN

EXPECTED AIRPLANES DUE TO THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS AND AEROSPACE WORKERS (IAM) STRIKE DURING THE MONTH OF SEPTEMBER 2005. THIS RESULTED IN APPROXIMATELY $2,000 MILLION LOWER REVENUE THAN ANTICIPATED FOR 2005.

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS

THE $851 MILLION INCREASE IN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2007 OVER THE COMPARABLE PERIOD OF 2006 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO EARNINGS OF $950 MILLION ON INCREASED NEW AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES AND $304 MILLION IN

INCREASED EARNINGS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMERCIAL AVIATION SUPPORT BUSINESS. IN ADDITION COST PERFORMANCE IMPROVED BY $169 MILLION. THESE WERE OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF $572 MILLION.

THE $1,302 MILLION INCREASE IN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS IN 2006 OVER THE COMPARABLE

PERIOD OF 2005 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO EARNINGS OF $1,781 MILLION ON INCREASED NEW AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES AND $315 MILLION IN INCREASED EARNINGS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMMERCIAL AVIATION SUPPORT BUSINESS. IN ADDITION COST PERFORMANCE IMPROVED

BY $226 MILLION. SUCH ITEMS WERE OFFSET BY INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS OF $1,088 MILLION. IN 2005 WE HAD A LOSS ON THE SALE OF WICHITA, KANSAS AND TULSA AND MCALESTER, OKLAHOMA OPERATIONS OF $68 MILLION. THE IAM STRIKE RESULTED IN LOWER

OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2005 DUE TO 29 FEWER THAN EXPECTED AIRPLANE DELIVERIES.

BACKLOG

THE BACKLOG INCREASE IN 2007 RELATED TO ORDERS IN EXCESS OF DELIVERIES FOR ALL PROGRAMS, WHILE THE INCREASE IN 2006 RELATED TO ORDERS IN EXCESS OF DELIVERIES FOR 737NG, 747 AND 787.

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY IS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE QUANTITY OF

AIRPLANES THAT WILL BE PRODUCED FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. ITS DETERMINATION IS LIMITED BY THE ABILITY TO MAKE REASONABLY DEPENDABLE ESTIMATES OF THE REVENUE AND COSTS OF THESE CONTRACTS. IT IS A KEY DETERMINANT OF GROSS

MARGINS WE RECOGNIZE ON SALES OF INDIVIDUAL AIRPLANES THROUGHOUT A PROGRAMS LIFE. ESTIMATION OF EACH PROGRAMS ACCOUNTING QUANTITY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SEVERAL FACTORS THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF THE DEMAND FOR THAT PROGRAM, INCLUDING FIRM

ORDERS, LETTERS OF INTENT FROM PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS, AND MARKET STUDIES. WE REVIEW OUR PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITIES QUARTERLY.

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION COSTS INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS, A PORTION OF WHICH DO

NOT VARY WITH PRODUCTION RATES. AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME NEEDED TO PRODUCE THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY DECREASES, THE AVERAGE COST OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY ALSO DECREASES AS THESE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL COST ESTIMATES, THUS

INCREASING THE GROSS MARGIN AND RELATED EARNINGS PROVIDED OTHER FACTORS DO NOT CHANGE.

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH PROGRAM MAY INCLUDE UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED, UNDELIVERED UNITS UNDER CONTRACT, AND UNITS ANTICIPATED TO BE UNDER CONTRACT IN THE REASONABLE FUTURE (ANTICIPATED ORDERS). IN DEVELOPING

TOTAL PROGRAM ESTIMATES ALL OF THESE ITEMS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY MUST BE CONSIDERED. THE TABLE BELOW PROVIDES DETAILS AS OF DECEMBER 31.

FIRM ORDERS REPRESENT NEW AIRCRAFT PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WHERE THE CUSTOMERS RIGHTS TO CANCEL

WITHOUT PENALTY HAVE EXPIRED. TYPICALLY CUSTOMER RIGHTS TO CANCEL WITHOUT PENALTY INCLUDE THE CUSTOMER RECEIVING APPROVAL FROM ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, GOVERNMENT AND COMPLETING FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. ALL SUCH CANCELLATION RIGHTS MUST

BE SATISFIED OR EXPIRED PRIOR TO RECORDING A FIRM ORDER EVEN IF SATISFYING SUCH CONDITIONS ARE HIGHLY CERTAIN. FIRM ORDERS EXCLUDE OPTION AIRCRAFT AND AIRCRAFT WITH CANCELLATION RIGHTS.

CUMULATIVE FIRM ORDERS REPRESENT THE CUMULATIVE NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES PLUS

UNDELIVERED FIRM ORDERS.

737 NEXT-GENERATION

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 737 NEXT-GENERATION PROGRAM INCREASED BY 600 UNITS DURING 2007 DUE TO THE PROGRAMS NORMAL PROGRESSION OF OBTAINING ADDITIONAL ORDERS AND DELIVERING AIRCRAFT.

747 PROGRAM

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 747 PROGRAM INCREASED BY 25 UNITS

DURING 2007. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007 WE COMPLETED FIRM CONFIGURATION OF THE 747-8 INTERCONTINENTAL AIRPLANE AND DURING 2006 WE COMPLETED FIRM CONFIGURATION OF THE 747-8 FREIGHTER. WHILE THERE ARE ALWAYS RISKS TO DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND

CERTIFICATION SCHEDULES IN THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW COMMERCIAL DERIVATIVE AIRPLANE, DELIVERIES OF THE FIRST 747-8 FREIGHTER AND INTERCONTINENTAL AIRPLANE ARE TARGETED FOR LATE 2009 AND LATE 2010.

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

767 PROGRAM

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 767 PROGRAM INCREASED BY 13 UNITS DURING 2007.

777 PROGRAM

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 777 PROGRAM INCREASED BY 50 UNITS

DURING 2007 AS A RESULT OF THE PROGRAMS NORMAL PROGRESSION OF OBTAINING ADDITIONAL ORDERS AND DELIVERING AIRCRAFT. FIRM CONFIGURATION OF THE 777 FREIGHTER WAS COMPLETED DURING 2006. DELIVERIES OF THE FIRST 777 FREIGHTER ARE TARGETED FOR

LATE 2008.

787 PROGRAM

WE ARE IN THE VERY CRITICAL STAGES OF

FINAL ASSEMBLY AND PLANNING FOR FLIGHT TEST, AND THE RISKS THAT ARE ALWAYS INHERENT IN THESE LATTER STAGES OF AIRPLANE PRODUCTION STILL REMAIN. WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSEMBLY OF THE FIRST AIRPLANES, INCLUDING START-UP

ISSUES IN OUR FACTORY, MANAGEMENT OF OUR EXTENDED GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN, COMPLETION AND INTEGRATION OF TRAVELED WORK AND RECONCILIATION OF THE AIRPLANES CONFIGURATION WITH SUPPLIER AND PARTNER ENGINEERING. IN JANUARY 2008 WE ANNOUNCED THAT FIRST

FLIGHT OF THE 787 HAS BEEN MOVED FROM THE END OF THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2008 TO AROUND THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2008 TO PROVIDE ADDITIONAL TIME TO COMPLETE ASSEMBLY OF THE FIRST AIRPLANE. DELIVERIES ARE NOW EXPECTED TO BEGIN IN EARLY 2009,

RATHER THAN LATE 2008. WE CONTINUE WORKING WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS TO ASSESS THE SPECIFIC IMPACTS OF THE SCHEDULE CHANGE ON THE FLIGHT TEST PROGRAM AND ENTRY INTO SERVICE.

FLEET SUPPORT

WE PROVIDE THE OPERATORS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES WITH ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES TO FACILITATE EFFICIENT AND

SAFE AIRCRAFT OPERATION. COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS COMMERCIAL AVIATION SUPPORT, THESE ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES BEGIN PRIOR TO AIRCRAFT DELIVERY AND CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE OPERATIONAL LIFE OF THE AIRCRAFT. THEY INCLUDE FLIGHT AND MAINTENANCE TRAINING,

FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT COSTS, ENGINEERING SERVICES AND TECHNICAL DATA AND DOCUMENTS. THE COSTS FOR FLEET SUPPORT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY LESS THAN 1.5% OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED COSTS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THIS LEVEL OF

EXPENDITURES IS ANTICIPATED TO CONTINUE IN THE UPCOMING YEARS. THESE COSTS DO NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY WITH CURRENT PRODUCTION RATES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE FOLLOWING CHART SUMMARIZES THE TIME HORIZON BETWEEN GO-AHEAD AND CERTIFICATION/INITIAL DELIVERY FOR MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

DERIVATIVES AND PROGRAMS.

OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE

INCREASED $572 MILLION AND $1,088 MILLION IN 2007 AND 2006. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IS NET OF DEVELOPMENT COST SHARING PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS. THE INCREASE IN 2007 WAS DUE TO HIGHER SPENDING OF $542 MILLION, PRIMARILY ON 787 AND

747-8, AND $30 MILLION OF LOWER SUPPLIER DEVELOPMENT COST SHARING PAYMENTS. WE ANTICIPATE A DECREASE IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING FOR 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED 787 PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

IDS CONSISTS OF THREE CAPABILITIES-DRIVEN BUSINESSES: PRECISION ENGAGEMENT AND MOBILITY SYSTEMS (PE&MS), NETWORK AND SPACE SYSTEMS (N&SS), AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS.

DEFENSE ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

THE U.S. IS FACED WITH CONTINUOUS FORCE DEPLOYMENTS

OVERSEAS, STABILITY OPERATIONS IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ, AND UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT NEAR-PEER ADVERSARY STATES WITH GROWING SOPHISTICATION AND MILITARY MEANS. AT THE SAME TIME, OUR DEFENSE DEPARTMENT FACES THE SIMULTANEOUS REQUIREMENTS TO RECAPITALIZE

IMPORTANT DEFENSE CAPABILITIES AND TO TRANSFORM THE FORCE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF AVAILABLE TECHNOLOGIES TO MEET THE CHANGING NATIONAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT AS OUTLINED IN THE LATEST QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW (QDR). ALL OF THIS MUST BE CARRIED OUT

AGAINST A BACKDROP OF SIGNIFICANT FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICITS AND BIPARTISAN OBJECTIVES TO REDUCE AND ULTIMATELY ELIMINATE ANNUAL DEFICIT SPENDING AS WELL AS THE UPCOMING 2008 PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

WILL REMAIN CHALLENGING FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT DECADE.

BECAUSE U.S. DOD

SPENDING WAS ABOUT HALF OF WORLDWIDE DEFENSE SPENDING AND REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 84% OF IDS REVENUE IN 2007, THE TRENDS AND DRIVERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE U.S. DOD BUDGET ARE CRITICAL. THE U.S. DOD BUDGET HAS GROWN SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE PAST

DECADE, PARTICULARLY AFTER THE TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. ALTHOUGH THE GROWTH RATE HAD MODERATED IN RECENT YEARS, THE 2009 SUBMITTAL EQUATES TO A 7.5% INCREASE OVER 2008. THE PRESIDENTS REQUEST FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 IS $515

BILLION, EXCLUDING THE ADDITIONAL INITIAL REQUEST OF $70 BILLION TO CONTINUE THE FIGHT IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERROR (GWOT). THE PROCUREMENT ACCOUNT CONTINUES TO SEE GROWTH WITH A REQUEST OF $104 BILLION, A 5% INCREASE OVER 2008, WHILE THE RESEARCH,

DEVELOPMENT, TEST & EVALUATION ACCOUNT INCREASED MODESTLY TO $80 BILLION, A 4% INCREASE FROM THE 2008 LEVEL. (ALL PROJECTIONS AND PERCENTAGE INCREASES ARE MADE WITHOUT TAKING INFLATION INTO ACCOUNT AND WITHOUT ACCOUNTING FOR SUPPLEMENTAL

FUNDING.)

OVER THE PAST YEARS, EMERGENCY SUPPLEMENTAL REQUESTS HAVE BEEN

USED TO COVER THE ON-GOING COSTS OF THE GWOT. IN ADDITION TO THE FISCAL YEAR 2008 DISCRETIONARY BUDGET REQUEST, THE PRESIDENT ALSO SUBMITTED SUPPLEMENTAL REQUESTS TOTALING $189 BILLION TO COVER OPERATIONS IN THE GWOT. IT IS ANTICIPATED THAT

ADDITIONAL SUPPLEMENTAL REQUESTS FOR 2009 WILL EXCEED $100 BILLION, INCLUDING THE $70 BILLION INITIALLY REQUESTED, AND THAT THE TREND TO USE SUPPLEMENTAL REQUESTS TO FUND THE GWOT WILL CONTINUE.

EVEN THOUGH WE CONTINUE TO SEE MODEST GROWTH IN THE U.S. DOD BUDGET, IT IS UNLIKELY

THAT THE U.S. DOD WILL BE ABLE TO FULLY FUND THE HARDWARE PROGRAMS ALREADY IN DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS NEW INITIATIVES IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE CAPABILITY GAPS IDENTIFIED IN THE LATEST QDR. THIS IMBALANCE BETWEEN FUTURE COSTS OF HARDWARE PROGRAMS AND

EXPECTED FUNDING LEVELS IS NOT UNCOMMON IN THE U.S. DOD AND IS ROUTINELY MANAGED BY INTERNALLY ADJUSTING PRIORITIES AND SCHEDULES, RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS, AND LENGTHENING PRODUCTION RUNS TO MEET THE CONSTRAINTS OF AVAILABLE FUNDING AND OCCASIONALLY

BY CANCELLATION OF PROGRAMS. WE EXPECT THE U.S. DOD WILL RESPOND TO FUTURE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS BY FOCUSING ON AFFORDABILITY STRATEGIES THAT EMPHASIZE JOINTNESS AND NETWORK-ENABLED OPERATIONS. THESE STRATEGIES WILL BE ENABLED THROUGH PERSISTENT

INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE, LONG-RANGE STRIKE, SPECIAL OPERATIONS, UNMANNED SYSTEMS, PRECISION GUIDED KINETIC AND NON-KINETIC WEAPONS AS WELL AS CONTINUED PRIVATIZATION OF LOGISTICS AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE OVERALL

EFFECTIVENESS WHILE MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER COSTS.

CONSOLIDATION OF

CONTRACTOR-PROVIDED U.S. GOVERNMENT LAUNCH CAPABILITIES WAS COMPLETED WITH THE FORMATION OF THE ULA JOINT VENTURE IN 2006. THIS CONSOLIDATION WAS DRIVEN BY THE LIMITED SCHEDULE OF GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES AS WELL AS THE DOWNTURN IN THE COMMERCIAL LAUNCH

MARKET. LAUNCH CONTRACTORS HAD BUILT BUSINESS CASES AROUND THE GOVERNMENT MARKET BEING SUPPLEMENTED BY A ROBUST COMMERCIAL MARKET, BUT AS THE COMMERCIAL MARKET DECLINED THESE BUSINESS CASES WERE RE-EVALUATED. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS AN ASSURED

ACCESS TO SPACE POLICY WHICH REQUIRES THAT TWO SEPARATE VEHICLES BE AVAILABLE FOR USE. THE ULA JOINT VENTURE IS INTENDED TO PROVIDE THIS ASSURANCE.

CIVIL SPACE TRANSPORTATION AND EXPLORATION ENVIRONMENT

NASA HAS HAD STABLE BUT VERY LITTLE GROWTH IN THEIR

FUNDING IN THIS DECADE. NASAS FISCAL YEAR 2007 APPROPRIATION OF $16.6 BILLION WAS APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO THE FISCAL YEAR 2006 FUNDING LEVEL. NASAS BUDGET REMAINS FOCUSED ON NEEDED FUNDS FOR SPACE SHUTTLE OPERATIONS, INTERNATIONAL SPACE

STATION, AND NEW INITIATIVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE VISION FOR SPACE EXPLORATION. WE ANTICIPATE FUNDING LEVELS TO REMAIN IN THE $17-$18 BILLION RANGE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. NASA IS CONTINUING TO PURSUE ELEMENTS OF THE VISION FOR SPACE EXPLORATION, WHICH

WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES.

COMMERCIAL SATELLITE

ENVIRONMENT

THE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE MARKET HAS STRENGTHENED SINCE THE DOWNTURN EARLIER IN THE DECADE AND IS EXPECTED TO STABILIZE WITH REPLACEMENT DEMAND THROUGH THE END OF THE DECADE. THE MARKET REMAINS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE WITH OVERCAPACITY

ACROSS THE OVERALL INDUSTRY AND STRONG PRESSURE ON PRICING. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE PROFITABLE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE OPPORTUNITIES WHERE THE CUSTOMER VALUES OUR TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND UNIQUE SOLUTIONS.

SINCE OUR OPERATING CYCLE IS

LONG-TERM AND INVOLVES MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION CONTRACTS WITH VARYING DELIVERY AND MILESTONE SCHEDULES, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR YEAR, OR YEAR-TO-YEAR COMPARISONS OF REVENUES AND EARNINGS, MAY NOT BE

INDICATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THE CUSTOMER AND THEIR FUNDING SOURCES, OUR ORDERS MIGHT BE STRUCTURED AS ANNUAL FOLLOW-ON CONTRACTS, OR AS ONE LARGE MULTI-YEAR ORDER OR LONG-TERM AWARD. AS A RESULT,

PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF BACKLOG ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE WORKLOADS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS OF COMPARATIVE RESULTS AMONG PERIODS SHOULD BE VIEWED IN THIS CONTEXT.

REVENUES

IDS REVENUES DECREASED 1% IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE THE EXCLUSION OF THE GOVERNMENT DELTA VOLUME FROM N&SS REVENUES,

NOW A REVENUE COMPONENT FOR OUR JOINT VENTURE ULA. DECREASED REVENUE FROM THIS EXCLUSION AND LOWER REVENUES IN THE PE&MS SEGMENT WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED VOLUME IN OTHER N&SS PROGRAMS AND GROWTH IN THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS SEGMENT. IDS

REVENUES INCREASED 4% IN 2006 AS GROWTH IN PE&MS AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER VOLUME IN N&SS.

OPERATING EARNINGS

IDS OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED BY $408 MILLION IN 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO $770 MILLION OF CHARGES ON THE AEW&C

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IN 2006. THE 2007 INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER EARNINGS IN THE PE&MS AND N&SS SEGMENTS. OPERATING EARNINGS

DECREASED BY $887 MILLION IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 REFLECTING A $569 MILLION NET GAIN ON THE SALE OF ROCKETDYNE IN 2005 AND $770 MILLION OF CHARGES ON THE AEW&C

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM IN 2006 PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED MARGINS ON OTHER PROGRAMS.

BACKLOG

TOTAL BACKLOG IS COMPRISED OF CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG, WHICH REPRESENTS WORK WE ARE ON CONTRACT TO PERFORM FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED FUNDING, AND UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG, WHICH REPRESENTS WORK WE ARE ON CONTRACT TO

PERFORM FOR WHICH FUNDING HAS NOT YET BEEN AUTHORIZED AND APPROPRIATED. IDS TOTAL BACKLOG DECREASED 5% IN 2007, FROM $75,715 MILLION TO $71,710 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO CURRENT YEAR DELIVERIES AND SALES ON MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS AWARDED IN PRIOR

YEARS WITH THE LARGEST DECREASES IN FCS, C-17, AND P-8A PROGRAMS.

FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON

THE CHANGES BETWEEN PERIODS, REFER TO THE DISCUSSIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS BELOW.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

OUR BUSINESS INCLUDES A

VARIETY OF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE COMPLEX DESIGN AND TECHNICAL CHALLENGES. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE COST-TYPE CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENTS. IN THESE CASES THE ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL RISKS ARE PRIMARILY IN LOWER PROFIT RATES OR PROGRAM

CANCELLATION IF MILESTONES AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS ARE NOT ACCOMPLISHED. EXAMPLES OF THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE AIRBORNE LASER, E/A-18G, FAMILY OF BEYOND LINE-OF-SIGHT TERMINALS (JTRS), FCS, GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE (GMD), JOINT TACTICAL RADIO

SYSTEM, P-8A AND PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS.

SOME OF OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

ARE CONTRACTED ON A FIXED-PRICE BASIS. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE HIGHLY COMPLEX DESIGNS. AS TECHNICAL OR QUALITY ISSUES ARISE, WE MAY EXPERIENCE SCHEDULE DELAYS AND COST IMPACTS, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR ESTIMATED COST TO PERFORM THE WORK OR

REDUCE OUR ESTIMATED PRICE, EITHER OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHARGE. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ONGOING, AND WHILE WE BELIEVE THE COST AND FEE ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE, THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF THESE

PROGRAMS CREATES FINANCIAL RISK AS ADDITIONAL COMPLETION COSTS MAY BECOME NECESSARY OR SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES COULD BE MISSED, WHICH COULD TRIGGER TERMINATION-FOR-DEFAULT PROVISIONS, THE LOSS OF SATELLITE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS, OR OTHER

FINANCIALLY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE RISK FOR REACH-FORWARD LOSSES IF OUR ESTIMATED COSTS EXCEED OUR ESTIMATED CONTRACT REVENUES. EXAMPLES OF THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE AEW&C, INTERNATIONAL KC-767 TANKER, COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY

SATELLITES, SBINET, VIGILARE AND HIGH FREQUENCY MODERNISATION.

REVENUES DECREASED 3% IN 2007 COMPARED WITH AN INCREASE OF 6% IN 2006. THE DECREASE OF $422 MILLION IN 2007 WAS DUE TO REDUCED DELIVERIES OF THE APACHE AND T-45 AIRCRAFT AND JOINT DIRECT ATTACK MUNITIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER DELIVERIES OF

CHINOOK AND F-18 AIRCRAFT AND HIGHER VOLUME ON THE P-8A PROGRAM. THE REVENUE GROWTH OF $799 MILLION IN 2006 WAS DRIVEN BY HIGHER DELIVERIES OF F-15 AND APACHE AIRCRAFT AND HIGHER VOLUME ON P-8A, F-22, AND CHINOOK, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED

REVENUES ON AEW&C.

OPERATING EARNINGS

PE&MS OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED BY $421 MILLION IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2006 CHARGES OF $770 MILLION ON THE AEW&C DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER 2007 EARNINGS DUE TO REVISED COST ESTIMATES ON THE

INTERNATIONAL KC-767 TANKER PROGRAM, LOWER PRICES ON THE C-17 PROGRAM AND REVISED COST AND REVENUE ESTIMATES ON THE AEW&C PROGRAM. OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED BY $512 MILLION IN 2006 DUE TO THE ABOVE MENTIONED AEW&C CHARGE, WHICH WAS

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EARNINGS FROM REVENUE GROWTH, FAVORABLE CONTRACT MIX, AND REDUCED COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES ON THE 767 TANKER PROGRAM.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE PE&MS SEGMENT CONTINUES TO FOCUS ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES WHERE IT CAN USE ITS

CUSTOMER KNOWLEDGE, TECHNICAL STRENGTH AND LARGE-SCALE INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES TO PROVIDE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MEET THE WAR FIGHTERS ENDURING NEEDS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAS REMAINED CONSISTENT OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS. RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES LEVERAGE OUR CAPABILITIES IN ARCHITECTURES, SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND WEAPON SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO ENHANCE OUR CUSTOMERS CAPABILITIES IN THE AREAS OF MOBILITY, PRECISION

EFFECTS, SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND SURVIVABILITY. THESE EFFORTS FOCUS ON INCREASING MISSION EFFECTIVENESS AND INTEROPERABILITY, AND IMPROVING AFFORDABILITY, RELIABILITY AND ECONOMIC OWNERSHIP. CONTINUED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS IN

UNMANNED TECHNOLOGY AND SYSTEMS HAVE ENABLED THE DEMONSTRATION OF MULTI-VEHICLE COORDINATED FLIGHT AND DISTRIBUTED CONTROL OF HIGH-PERFORMANCE UNMANNED COMBAT AIR VEHICLES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN ADVANCED WEAPONS TECHNOLOGIES EMPHASIZES, AMONG

OTHER THINGS, PRECISION GUIDANCE AND MULTI-MODE TARGETING. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS IN THE GLOBAL TANKER AIRCRAFT PROGRAM REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE STATE-OF-THE-ART REFUELING CAPABILITIES TO DOMESTIC AND NON-U.S.

CUSTOMERS. INVESTMENTS WERE ALSO MADE TO SUPPORT VARIOUS INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING P-8A AND AEW&C AIRCRAFT. OTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS INCLUDE UPGRADE AND TECHNOLOGY INSERTIONS TO

NETWORK-ENABLE AND ENHANCE THE CAPABILITY AND COMPETITIVENESS OF CURRENT PRODUCT LINES SUCH AS THE F/A-18E/F SUPER HORNET, F-15E EAGLE, AH-64 APACHE, CH-47 CHINOOK AND C-17 GLOBEMASTER.

BACKLOG

PE&MS TOTAL BACKLOG DECREASED BY 6% IN 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO DELIVERIES AND SALES ON C-17,

F/A-18, P-8A AND F-15. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A MULTI-YEAR CONTRACT FOR F-22 AIRCRAFT AND INTERNATIONAL ORDERS FOR AEW&C AND F/A-18 AIRCRAFT. TOTAL BACKLOG DECREASED BY 8% IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO DELIVERIES

AND SALES ON F/A-18 AND F-15 FROM MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS AWARDED IN PRIOR YEARS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

ITEMS WHICH COULD HAVE A FUTURE IMPACT ON PE&MS OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

AEW&C

DURING 2006 WE RECORDED CHARGES OF $770 MILLION ON OUR INTERNATIONAL AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING & CONTROL PROGRAM. THIS

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, ALSO KNOWN AS WEDGETAIL IN AUSTRALIA AND PEACE EAGLE IN TURKEY, CONSISTS OF A 737-700 AIRCRAFT OUTFITTED WITH A VARIETY OF COMMAND AND CONTROL AND ADVANCED RADAR SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN INSTALLED ON AN AIRPLANE

BEFORE. WEDGETAIL INCLUDES SIX AIRCRAFT AND PEACE EAGLE INCLUDES FOUR AIRCRAFT. THIS IS AN ADVANCED AND COMPLEX FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM INVOLVING TECHNICAL CHALLENGES AT THE INDIVIDUAL SUBSYSTEM LEVEL AND IN THE OVERALL INTEGRATION OF THESE

SUBSYSTEMS INTO A RELIABLE AND EFFECTIVE OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE; HOWEVER, THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF THE PROGRAMS CREATES FINANCIAL RISK AS ADDITIONAL

COMPLETION COSTS MAY BE NECESSARY OR SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES COULD BE MISSED.

INTERNATIONAL KC-767 TANKER PROGRAM

DURING 2007, THE PE&MS SEGMENT RECORDED CHARGES OF $152 MILLION WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET AT THE CONSOLIDATED LEVEL. CURRENTLY THE INTERNATIONAL KC-767 TANKER PROGRAM INCLUDES FOUR

AIRCRAFT FOR THE ITALIAN AIR FORCE AND FOUR AIRCRAFT FOR THE JAPANESE AIR SELF DEFENSE FORCE. THESE CHARGES ARE ASSOCIATED WITH ADDITIONAL ESTIMATED COSTS FOR MITIGATING BOTH THE RISKS ON THE FLIGHT TEST PROGRAM AND THE DELIVERY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH

THE ITALY AND JAPAN CONTRACTS. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ONGOING, AND WHILE WE BELIEVE THE COST ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE, THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF THE PROGRAMS CREATES FINANCIAL RISK AS ADDITIONAL COMPLETION AND

DEVELOPMENT COSTS MAY BE NECESSARY OR SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES COULD BE MISSED.

C-17

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 WE DELIVERED 171 OF THE 190 C-17 AIRCRAFT ORDERED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE, WITH FINAL DELIVERIES SCHEDULED FOR 2009. IN JUNE 2007, BASED UPON CONTINUED BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT,

INCLUDING THE HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE ADDITION OF $2.4 BILLION FOR 10 C-17S IN THEIR MARK OF THE 2008 BUDGET, AND U.S. AIR FORCE TESTIMONY TO CONGRESS REFLECTING INTEREST IN ADDITIONAL C-17 AIRCRAFT, WE DIRECTED KEY SUPPLIERS TO BEGIN WORK ON

10 AIRCRAFT BEYOND THE 190 CURRENTLY ON ORDER. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, INVENTORY EXPENDITURES AND POTENTIAL TERMINATION LIABILITIES TO SUPPLIERS FOR WORK PERFORMED RELATED TO ANTICIPATED ORDERS FOR 10 C-17 AIRCRAFT TO THE U.S. AIR FORCE AND

ANTICIPATED INTERNATIONAL ORDERS FOR 3 ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT TOTALED APPROXIMATELY $215 MILLION. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL DECIDE IN 2008 TO COMPLETE PRODUCTION OF THE C-17 IF FURTHER ORDERS ARE NOT RECEIVED. WE ARE STILL EVALUATING THE

FULL FINANCIAL IMPACT OF A POTENTIAL PRODUCTION SHUT-DOWN, INCLUDING ANY RECOVERY THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT. SUCH RECOVERY FROM THE GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT INCLUDE THE COSTS INCURRED BY US RESULTING FROM THE SECOND-QUARTER DIRECTION

TO KEY SUPPLIERS TO BEGIN WORKING ON THE ADDITIONAL 10 AIRCRAFT.

REVENUES

N&SS REVENUES DECREASED 2% IN BOTH 2007 AND 2006. THE DECREASE OF $245 MILLION IN 2007 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE EXCLUSION OF GOVERNMENT DELTA VOLUME, NOW A COMPONENT OF OUR EQUITY INVESTMENT IN ULA AND LOWER FCS VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED VOLUME ON SBINET AND SEVERAL SATELLITE PROGRAMS. THE DECREASE OF $280 MILLION IN 2006 WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER VOLUME IN PROPRIETARY AND GMD AS WELL AS THE DIVESTITURE OF OUR ROCKETDYNE BUSINESS, WHICH WERE PARTLY OFFSET BY SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN FCS AND HIGHER DELTA IV VOLUME. ADDITIONAL IMPACTS RESULTED FROM FEWER MILESTONE

COMPLETIONS IN OUR COMMERCIAL SATELLITE BUSINESS IN 2006 AND THE COMPLETION OF A HOMELAND SECURITY CONTRACT IN 2005.

OPERATING EARNINGS

N&SS OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED BY $61 MILLION IN 2007 AND DECREASED BY $443 MILLION IN 2006. THE DECREASE IN 2007 WAS DUE TO LOWER EARNINGS ON FCS AND SEVERAL SATELLITE PROGRAMS. THESE DECREASES WERE

PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER AWARD FEES ON GMD AND A $44 MILLION GAIN ON SALE OF ANAHEIM PROPERTY. THE DECREASE IN 2006 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $569 MILLION NET GAIN ON THE ROCKETDYNE SALE AND HIGHER CONTRACT VALUES FOR DELTA IV LAUNCH CONTRACTS IN

2005, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED EARNINGS IN THE FCS PROGRAM IN 2006. N&SS OPERATING EARNINGS INCLUDE EQUITY EARNINGS OF $85 MILLION, $71 MILLION AND $72 MILLION FROM THE UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE JOINT VENTURE IN 2007, 2006, AND 2005,

RESPECTIVELY AND EQUITY LOSS OF $11 MILLION AND EQUITY EARNINGS OF $5 MILLION FROM THE ULA JOINT VENTURE IN 2007 AND 2006. THE ULA EQUITY EARNINGS AND LOSS AMOUNTS ARE NET OF THE BASIS DIFFERENCE AMORTIZATION.

DIVESTITURES

ON FEBRUARY 28, 2005, WE COMPLETED THE STOCK SALE OF

ELECTRONIC DYNAMIC DEVICES INC. TO L-3 COMMUNICATIONS. ON AUGUST 2, 2005 WE COMPLETED THE SALE OF OUR ROCKETDYNE BUSINESS TO UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION. SEE NOTE 7 EXIT ACTIVITY AND DIVESTITURES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE N&SS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING REMAINS

FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF INTELLIGENCE AND SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS; COMMUNICATIONS AND COMMAND AND CONTROL CAPABILITIES THAT SUPPORT A NETWORK-ENABLED ARCHITECTURE APPROACH FOR OUR VARIOUS GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS. WE ARE INVESTING IN THE

COMMUNICATIONS MARKET TO ENABLE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN EXISTING AIR/GROUND PLATFORMS, INCREASE COMMUNICATIONS AVAILABILITY AND BANDWIDTH THROUGH MORE ROBUST SPACE SYSTEMS, AND LEVERAGE INNOVATIVE COMMUNICATIONS CONCEPTS. KEY PROGRAMS IN THIS AREA

INCLUDE JOINT TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEM, FCS, GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM, AND TRANSFORMATIONAL SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. INVESTMENTS WERE ALSO MADE TO SUPPORT CONCEPTS THAT WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEXT-GENERATION SPACE INTELLIGENCE

SYSTEMS. ALONG WITH INCREASED FUNDING TO SUPPORT THESE AREAS OF ARCHITECTURE AND NETWORK-ENABLED CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT, WE ALSO MAINTAINED OUR INVESTMENT LEVELS IN GLOBAL MISSILE DEFENSE AND ADVANCED MISSILE DEFENSE CONCEPTS AND TECHNOLOGIES.

BACKLOG

N&SS TOTAL BACKLOG DECREASED BY 7% IN 2007 COMPARED

WITH 2006 DUE TO REVENUES RECOGNIZED ON MULTI-YEAR ORDERS RECEIVED IN PRIOR YEARS ON FCS AND PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN OUR SPACE EXPLORATION PROGRAMS. TOTAL BACKLOG DECREASED BY 7% IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 PRIMARILY

DUE TO REVENUES RECOGNIZED ON MULTI-YEAR ORDERS RECEIVED IN PRIOR YEARS ON THE FCS PROGRAM.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

ITEMS WHICH COULD HAVE A FUTURE IMPACT ON N&SS OPERATIONS INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE

ON DECEMBER 1, 2006, WE COMPLETED THE TRANSACTION WITH LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION (LOCKHEED) TO CREATE A

50/50 JOINT VENTURE NAMED UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE L.L.C. (ULA). ULA COMBINES THE PRODUCTION, ENGINEERING, TEST AND LAUNCH OPERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES OF BOEING DELTA AND LOCKHEED ATLAS ROCKETS. IN CONNECTION WITH THE

TRANSACTION, WE INITIALLY CONTRIBUTED NET ASSETS OF $914 MILLION AT DECEMBER 1, 2006. ON JULY 24, 2007 WE AND LOCKHEED REACHED AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO RESOLUTION OF THE FINAL WORKING CAPITAL AND THE VALUE OF THE LAUNCH VEHICLE SUPPORT

CONTRACTS THAT EACH PARTY CONTRIBUTED TO FORM ULA. EFFECTIVE AUGUST 15, 2007 THE PARTIES RECEIVED ALL NECESSARY APPROVALS PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE CONSENT ORDER AND THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL

CONTRIBUTIONS FROM BOTH PARTIES WITH BOEING AGREEING TO CONTRIBUTE AN ADDITIONAL $97 MILLION WHICH DID NOT RESULT IN A CASH OUTFLOW AS IT WILL BE OFFSET AGAINST FUTURE PAYMENTS DUE TO US FROM ULA ASSOCIATED WITH AN INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT.

ADDITIONALLY, CONFORMED ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS MADE BY ULA RESULTED IN ADJUSTMENTS TO ULAS BALANCE SHEET. THE BOOK VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT EXCEEDS OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF ULAS NET ASSETS. THIS DIFFERENCE WILL BE EXPENSED RATABLY IN

FUTURE YEARS. BASED ON THE ADJUSTED CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE CONFORMED ACCOUNTING POLICIES ESTABLISHED BY ULA, THIS AMORTIZATION IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $14 MILLION ANNUALLY FOR THE NEXT 17 YEARS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FORMATION OF ULA, WE AND LOCKHEED EACH COMMITTED TO PROVIDE UP

TO $25 MILLION IN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND WE EACH HAVE AGREED TO EXTEND A LINE OF CREDIT TO ULA OF UP TO $200 MILLION TO SUPPORT ITS WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. WE AND LOCKHEED TRANSFERRED PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN U.S.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS TO ULA AS OF THE CLOSING DATE. WE AND LOCKHEED AGREED TO JOINTLY GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF THOSE CONTRACTS TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

IN DECEMBER 2006, WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ULA THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2020 AGAINST POTENTIAL NON-RECOVERABILITY OF $1,375 MILLION OF

BOEING DELTA INVENTORIES INCLUDED IN CONTRIBUTED ASSETS PLUS $1,860 MILLION OF INVENTORY SUBJECT TO THE INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT WHICH ENDS ON MARCH 31, 2021. SINCE INCEPTION, ULA SOLD $443 MILLION OF INVENTORIES THAT WERE CONTRIBUTED BY US.

DURING 2007, ULA DETERMINED THAT CERTAIN DELTA II INVENTORY IS NOT FULLY RECOVERABLE. AS A RESULT WE RECORDED CHARGES OF $31 MILLION FOR NON-RECOVERABLE DELTA II INVENTORY AND $39 MILLION FOR OUR SHARE OF THE LOSS RECORDED BY ULA RELATED TO DELTA

II. FUTURE DECISIONS REGARDING THE DELTA II PROGRAM COULD REDUCE OUR EARNINGS BY UP TO $100 MILLION.

WE ALSO AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ULA IN THE EVENT ULA IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN RE-PRICING OF CERTAIN CONTRACTS WHICH WE CONTRIBUTED TO ULA AND TO WHICH WE BELIEVE ULA IS ENTITLED. WE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY

SHORTFALL AND MAY RECORD UP TO $332 MILLION IN PRE-TAX LOSSES RELATED TO THESE CONTRACTS.

SEA LAUNCH

WE MADE NO ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO

THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007.

THE

VENTURE CONDUCTED ZERO, FIVE AND FOUR SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006, AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. A SEA LAUNCH ZENIT-3SL VEHICLE, CARRYING A BOEING-BUILT NSS-8 SATELLITE, EXPERIENCED AN ANOMALY DURING LAUNCH ON

JANUARY 30, 2007. THE LAUNCH PLATFORM HAS BEEN REPAIRED AND RESUMED FLIGHT OPERATIONS ON JANUARY 15, 2008, SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHING A BOEING-BUILT SATELLITE. THE VENTURE INCURRED LOSSES IN 2007 DUE TO A DELAY IN ITS 2007 LAUNCH MANIFEST

THAT WAS CAUSED BY THE LAUNCH ANOMALY AND UNUSUALLY STRONG OCEAN CURRENTS AT THE LAUNCH SITE DURING NOVEMBER AND DECEMBER. THE VENTURE INCURRED LOSSES IN 2006 AND 2005 DUE TO THE RELATIVELY LOW PRICE AND VOLUME OF LAUNCHES, DRIVEN BY A DEPRESSED

COMMERCIAL SATELLITE MARKET AND OVERSUPPLY OF LAUNCH VEHICLES AS WELL AS A HIGH LEVEL OF DEBT AND DEBT SERVICING REQUIREMENTS.

WE SUSPENDED RECORDING EQUITY LOSSES AFTER WRITING OUR INVESTMENT IN AND DIRECT LOANS TO SEA LAUNCH DOWN TO ZERO IN 2001 AND ACCRUING OUR OBLIGATION FOR THIRD-PARTY

GUARANTEES ON SEA LAUNCH INDEBTEDNESS. WE ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO PROVIDE ANY FURTHER FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT THAT WE DO EXTEND ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO SEA LAUNCH IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL RECOGNIZE

SUSPENDED LOSSES AS APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT ALTERNATIVE CAPITAL STRUCTURES FOR THE VENTURE.

SATELLITES

THE BOEING-BUILT NSS-8 SATELLITE WAS DECLARED A TOTAL LOSS DUE TO AN ANOMALY DURING LAUNCH ON JANUARY 30, 2007. THE NSS-8 SATELLITE WAS INSURED FOR

$200 MILLION WHICH WAS COLLECTED DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER OF 2007. NEW SKIES SATELLITES B.V. (NEW SKIES) DECLINED TO EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO PURCHASE A REPLACEMENT SPACECRAFT DUE TO ITS ASSERTION THAT WE ANTICIPATORILY BREACHED THE

CONTRACT. WE BELIEVE THAT HAD NEW SKIES EXERCISED ITS OPTION, WE WOULD HAVE FULFILLED OUR CONTRACTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WE DO NOT EXPECT NEW SKIES ASSERTION TO MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR

CASH FLOWS.

SUPPORT SYSTEMS

REVENUES INCREASED $308 MILLION IN 2007 AND $814 MILLION IN 2006, AN INCREASE OF 5% AND 15%. THE INCREASES WERE DUE TO HIGHER INTEGRATED LOGISTICS (IL) PROGRAM VOLUME RESULTING FROM THE 2006 ACQUISITION OF AVIALL, INC. (AVIALL) AND INCREASED REVENUE

ON THE C-17 SUPPORT PROGRAM. HIGHER INTERNATIONAL PROGRAM VOLUME IN 2007 WAS THE RESULT OF OUR INCREASED OWNERSHIP IN ALSALAM AIRCRAFT COMPANY (ALSALAM) WHICH OCCURRED DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006. LOWER VOLUME ON SEVERAL MAINTENANCE,

MODIFICATION AND UPGRADES (MM&U) AND TRAINING SYSTEMS AND SERVICES (TS&S) PROGRAMS PARTIALLY OFFSET THE 2007 INCREASES. HIGHER VOLUME ON SEVERAL MM&U PROGRAMS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN 2006 REVENUES.

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 WE INCREASED OUR OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN ALSALAM, WHICH

OPERATES AS A MAINTENANCE, REPAIR AND OVERHAUL FACILITY FOR VARIOUS MILITARY AND COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. AS A RESULT, WE BEGAN CONSOLIDATING ALSALAMS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH GENERATED REVENUES OF $207 MILLION DURING 2007 AND $137 MILLION

DURING THE LAST THREE QUARTERS OF 2006.

OPERATING EARNINGS

SUPPORT SYSTEMS OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED BY 5% IN 2007 AND INCREASED BY 9% IN 2006 DRIVEN BY THE REVENUE INCREASES MENTIONED ABOVE IN ADDITION TO A DIFFERENT CONTRACT MIX.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

SUPPORT SYSTEMS CONTINUES TO FOCUS INVESTMENT STRATEGIES ON ITS CORE BUSINESSES INCLUDING IL,

MM&U, TS&S AND ADVANCED LOGISTICS SUPPORT SYSTEMS, AS WELL AS ON MOVING INTO THE INNOVATIVE NETWORK CENTRIC LOGISTICS AREAS. INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INNOVATIVE AND DISCIPLINED TOOLS,

PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS AS MARKET DISCRIMINATORS IN THE DELIVERY OF INTEGRATED CUSTOMER SOLUTIONS. EXAMPLES OF SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS STEMMING FROM THESE INVESTMENT STRATEGIES INCLUDE THE C-17 GLOBEMASTER SUSTAINMENT PARTNERSHIP, THE F/A-18 INTEGRATED

READINESS SUPPORT TEAMING PROGRAM, AND THE F-15 SINGAPORE PERFORMANCE BASED LOGISTICS CONTRACT.

BACKLOG

SUPPORT SYSTEMS TOTAL BACKLOG INCREASED BY 3% IN 2007 COMPARED WITH 2006 DUE TO INCREASES IN TS&S PROGRAMS AND INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT PROGRAMS WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN

MM&U AND IL PROGRAMS. TOTAL BACKLOG INCREASED BY 6% IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 DRIVEN BY A LARGE IL ORDER FOR CHINOOK SUPPORT.

BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION SEGMENT

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

BCCS CUSTOMER FINANCING AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 TOTALED $6,532 MILLION, WHICH WAS SUBSTANTIALLY COLLATERALIZED BY BOEING PRODUCED COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. WHILE WORLDWIDE

TRAFFIC LEVELS ARE WELL ABOVE THOSE IN THE PAST, THE EFFECTS OF HIGHER FUEL PRICES CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. AT THE SAME TIME, THE CREDIT RATINGS OF SOME AIRLINES, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES, HAVE REMAINED AT LOW LEVELS. A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BCCS PORTFOLIO IS CONCENTRATED AMONG U.S. COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS.

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CERTAIN AIRCRAFT MODELS IN BCCS PORTFOLIO HAVE RECENTLY EXPERIENCED A LOWER RATE OF DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE

AND SOME MODELS HAVE EXPERIENCED INCREASES IN MARKET VALUE. THIS MARKET VALUE CONDITION HAD BEEN DUE TO CERTAIN POSITIVE FACTORS INCLUDING PASSENGER LOAD AT RECORD HIGH LEVELS, A LIMITED SUPPLY OF ECONOMICALLY VIABLE USED AIRCRAFT, INCREASING LEASE

RATES, AND INCREASED DEMAND FROM USED AIRCRAFT BUYERS.

AIRCRAFT VALUES

AND LEASE RATES ARE IMPACTED BY THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF AIRCRAFT THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUT OF SERVICE. APPROXIMATELY 1,600 COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT (8.2% OF CURRENT WORLD FLEET) CONTINUE TO BE PARKED, INCLUDING BOTH IN-PRODUCTION AND OUT-OF-PRODUCTION

AIRCRAFT TYPES, OF WHICH OVER 60% ARE NOT EXPECTED TO RETURN TO SERVICE. AIRCRAFT VALUATIONS COULD DECLINE IF SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF AIRCRAFT, PARTICULARLY TYPES WITH RELATIVELY FEW OPERATORS, ARE PLACED OUT OF SERVICE.

THE SALE OR REPAYMENT AT MATURITY OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN 2006 AND LOWER NET GAIN ON DISPOSAL OF ASSETS OF $47 MILLION. BCCS REVENUES INCREASED $59 MILLION IN 2006, PRIMARILY DUE TO AN INCREASE OF INVESTMENT INCOME AND HIGHER GAIN ON THE

SALE OF AIRCRAFT AND CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN NOTES RECEIVABLE.

OPERATING EARNINGS

BCCS OPERATING EARNINGS ARE PRESENTED NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE,

PROVISION FOR (RECOVERY OF) LOSSES, ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION ON LEASED EQUIPMENT AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED BY $57 MILLION IN 2007 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTEREST

EXPENSE, LOWER ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE AND LOWER DEPRECIATION EXPENSE AND A RECOVERY OF LOSSES. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES.

BCC ENTERS INTO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH THE OTHER SEGMENT IN THE FORM OF INTERCOMPANY

GUARANTEES AND OTHER SUBSIDIES.

FINANCE RESTRUCTURINGS

FROM TIME TO TIME, CERTAIN BCC CUSTOMERS HAVE REQUESTED A RESTRUCTURING OF THEIR

TRANSACTIONS WITH BCC. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, BCC HAS NOT REACHED AGREEMENT ON ANY RESTRUCTURING REQUESTS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

OTHER SEGMENT

OTHER SEGMENT OPERATING LOSSES WERE $243 MILLION DURING 2007 AS COMPARED TO LOSSES OF $738 MILLION IN 2006. THE REDUCTION OF $495 MILLION WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO THE ABSENCE OF LOSSES RELATED TO CONNEXION BY BOEING, WHICH WE EXITED IN 2006. AS PART OF OUR EXIT FROM THIS BUSINESS, WE RECOGNIZED A CHARGE OF $320 MILLION IN 2006, IN ADDITION TO LOSSES OF $237 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2006. WE HAVE NOT REACHED FINAL SETTLEMENTS WITH ALL CUSTOMERS OR SUPPLIERS. WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE FINAL SETTLEMENTS WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

OTHER SEGMENT OPERATING LOSSES WERE $738 MILLION DURING 2006 AS COMPARED TO LOSSES OF

$363 MILLION IN 2005. THE INCREASE OF $375 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE $320 MILLION CHARGE FROM THE EXIT OF THE CONNEXION BY BOEING BUSINESS AND THE $68 MILLION ENVIRONMENTAL EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN 2006. THE OTHER SEGMENT RECORDED $74 MILLION OF

LOWER VALUATION ALLOWANCES FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING IN 2006 COMPARED TO 2005. ADDITIONALLY, DURING 2005, THE OTHER SEGMENT RECOGNIZED EARNINGS OF $63 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE BUYOUT OF SEVERAL OPERATING LEASE AIRCRAFT BY A CUSTOMER.

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES INCREASED BY $499 MILLION TO $7,499 MILLION IN 2006. THE INCREASE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER NET EARNINGS. THE WORKING CAPITAL IMPROVEMENTS IN 2006 COMPARED WITH 2005 REFLECT $1,340 MILLION OF LOWER PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2006. WORKING CAPITAL REDUCTIONS IN

2006 ALSO REFLECT HIGHER ADVANCES DRIVEN BY COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE ORDERS, DECREASED INVESTMENT IN CUSTOMER FINANCING, AND LOWER INCOME TAX PAYMENTS WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITY.

CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED TO $3,822

MILLION IN 2007 FROM $3,186 MILLION IN 2006, LARGELY DUE TO INCREASES IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY TIME DEPOSITS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY OUR INVESTMENT IN THE ACQUISITION OF AVIALL IN 2006. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 THE

RECORDED BALANCES OF TIME DEPOSITS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS WERE $1,025 MILLION AND $799 MILLION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, OUR EXTERNALLY MANAGED PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED INCOME INSTRUMENTS HAD AN AVERAGE DURATION OF 1.5 YEARS. THE BALANCE, AT

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, WAS $3,269 MILLION AND $3,180 MILLION, OF WHICH $306 MILLION AND $257 MILLION WAS CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM. THE INVESTMENTS ARE HELD AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE.

CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES INCREASED TO $3,186 MILLION IN 2006 FROM $98 MILLION

IN 2005. THE INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO OUR INVESTMENT OF $1,738 MILLION IN THE 2006 ACQUISITION OF AVIALL, NET OF $42 MILLION OF CASH ACQUIRED, AND $458 MILLION OF ASSUMED DEBT, IN AN ALL-CASH MERGER. THE ASSUMED DEBT WAS REPAID ON THE

ACQUISITION CLOSING DATE. IN 2005, WE RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $1,676 MILLION, PRIMARILY FROM THE DISPOSITION OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES OPERATIONS IN WICHITA, KANSAS AND TULSA AND MCALESTER, OKLAHOMA, AND THE SALE OF ROCKETDYNE.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES INCREASED TO $4,884

MILLION IN 2007 FROM $3,645 MILLION IN 2006 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES. CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES DECREASED TO $3,645 MILLION IN 2006 FROM $4,657 MILLION IN 2005 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER COMMON SHARE REPURCHASES.

DURING 2007, WE REPURCHASED 28,995,599 SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF

$95.68 IN OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND 28,432 SHARES IN STOCK SWAPS. DURING 2006, WE REPURCHASED 21,184,202 SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $80.18 IN OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, 3,749,377 SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF

$80.28 AS PART OF THE SHAREVALUE TRUST DISTRIBUTION, AND 49,288 SHARES IN STOCK SWAPS. DURING 2005, WE REPURCHASED 45,217,300 SHARES AT AN AVERAGE PRICE OF $63.60 IN OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AND 33,660 SHARES IN STOCK SWAPS.

IN 2007, WE REPAID $1,406 MILLION OF DEBT, INCLUDING $1,309 MILLION OF

DEBT HELD AT BCC. IN 2006, WE REPAID $1,681 MILLION OF DEBT, INCLUDING $713 MILLION OF DEBT HELD AT BCC AND $458 MILLION OF DEBT ASSUMED IN THE AVIALL ACQUISITION. IN 2005, WE REPAID $1,378 MILLION OF DEBT. THERE WERE NO DEBT ISSUANCES DURING 2007,

2006, OR 2005. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, THE RECORDED BALANCE OF DEBT WAS $8,217 MILLION AND $9,538 MILLION, OF WHICH $4,327 MILLION AND $5,590 MILLION WAS RECORDED AT BCC.

ON SEPTEMBER 12, 2007, FITCH RATINGS REVISED ITS RATINGS OUTLOOK TO POSITIVE FROM STABLE, CITING CONTINUATION

OF STRONG ORDERS AND PRODUCTION RAMP UP OF LARGE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT, IN ADDITION TO AN OVER-FUNDED STATUS OF OUR PENSION PLANS, DEBT REDUCTION AND STRONGER THAN EXPECTED CASH FLOWS. THE RATINGS WERE REAFFIRMED AT A+ FOR LONG-TERM BORROWINGS AND F1

FOR SHORT-TERM BORROWINGS. ON JANUARY 16, 2008, FITCH RATINGS CHANGED THEIR OUTLOOK ON THE A+ RATING TO STABLE FROM POSITIVE, CITING THE IMPACT OF DELAYS IN THE 787 PROGRAM.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

WE AND BCC HAVE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT CONTINUE TO SERVE AS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL SOURCES OF

SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY. THROUGHOUT 2007 AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, NEITHER WE NOR BCC HAD ANY COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING.

WE BELIEVE WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPACITY. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE $3,000 MILLION ($1,500 MILLION EXCLUSIVELY AVAILABLE FOR BCC) OF UNUSED BORROWING ON REVOLVING

CREDIT LINE AGREEMENTS. IN 2007, WE RENEWED THE 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY AND THE 5-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY, OF WHICH $500 MILLION AND $1,000 MILLION IS ALLOCATED TO BCC. BCC HAS AN AGGREGATE OF $3,421 MILLION AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE FROM SHELF

REGISTRATIONS FILED WITH THE SEC, WHICH ARE DUE TO EXPIRE IN NOVEMBER 2008. WE BELIEVE OUR INTERNALLY GENERATED LIQUIDITY, TOGETHER WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL CAPITAL RESOURCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY EXISTING COMMITMENTS AND PLANS, AND ALSO TO

PROVIDE ADEQUATE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF POTENTIAL STRATEGIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD THEY ARISE WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR.

WE AND LOCKHEED HAVE AGREED TO MAKE AVAILABLE TO ULA A LINE OF CREDIT IN THE AMOUNT OF UP TO $200 MILLION EACH AS MAY BE NECESSARY FROM TIME TO TIME TO SUPPORT

ULAS EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE BUSINESS DURING THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD FOLLOWING DECEMBER 1, 2006. ULA DID NOT REQUEST ANY FUNDS UNDER THE LINE OF CREDIT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007.

INCOME TAX OBLIGATIONS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, INCLUDING UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS, WAS $1,374 MILLION, OF WHICH $253 MILLION WE EXPECT TO PAY IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF

FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE REMAINING $1,121 MILLION. OUR INCOME TAX OBLIGATIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE TABLE ABOVE. SEE NOTE 4.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

PENSION CASH REQUIREMENTS ARE BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, PURSUANT TO ERISA

REGULATIONS, ALTHOUGH WE MAY MAKE ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS. ESTIMATES OF OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ARE BASED ON BOTH OUR ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND THE ESTIMATED CONTRIBUTIONS TO A SINGLE PLAN THAT IS FUNDED THROUGH A

TRUST.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT

CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE GOODS OR SERVICES THAT ARE LEGALLY BINDING; SPECIFY A FIXED, MINIMUM OR RANGE OF QUANTITIES; SPECIFY A FIXED, MINIMUM, VARIABLE, OR INDEXED PRICE PROVISION; AND SPECIFY APPROXIMATE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION. IN

ADDITION, THE AGREEMENTS ARE NOT CANCELABLE WITHOUT SUBSTANTIAL PENALTY. PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE AMOUNTS RECORDED AS WELL AS AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. APPROXIMATELY 11% OF THE PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS

DISCLOSED ABOVE ARE REIMBURSABLE TO US PURSUANT TO COST-TYPE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

PRODUCTION RELATED PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION INCLUDE AGREEMENTS FOR

PRODUCTION GOODS, TOOLING COSTS, ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS CONTRACTS, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS PRODUCTION RELATED OBLIGATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATION RELATES TO INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS. WE HAVE

ENTERED INTO CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS THAT SPECIFY DETERMINABLE PRICES AND QUANTITIES, AND LONG-TERM DELIVERY TIMEFRAMES. IN ADDITION, WE PURCHASE RAW MATERIALS ON BEHALF OF OUR SUPPLIERS. THESE AGREEMENTS REQUIRE

SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO BE PREPARED TO BUILD AND DELIVER ITEMS IN SUFFICIENT TIME TO MEET OUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULES. THE NEED FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS ARISES FROM THE EXTENDED PRODUCTION PLANNING HORIZON FOR MANY OF OUR

PRODUCTS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE INVENTORY COMMITMENTS IS SUPPORTED BY FIRM CONTRACTS AND/OR HAS HISTORICALLY RESULTED IN SETTLEMENT

THROUGH REIMBURSEMENT FROM CUSTOMERS FOR PENALTY PAYMENTS TO THE SUPPLIER SHOULD THE CUSTOMER NOT TAKE DELIVERY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN OUR FORECASTS OF

COSTS FOR PROGRAM AND CONTRACT ACCOUNTING. SOME INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS MAY INCLUDE ESCALATION ADJUSTMENTS. IN THESE LIMITED CASES, WE HAVE INCLUDED OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECT OF THE ESCALATION ADJUSTMENT IN THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN THE

TABLE ABOVE.

INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS

WE HAVE ENTERED

INTO VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. TO FACILITATE ECONOMIC FLOW BACK AND/OR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO THEIR BUSINESSES OR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AS THE RESULT OF THEIR PROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND/OR

SERVICES FROM US. THESE COMMITMENTS MAY BE SATISFIED BY OUR PLACEMENT OF DIRECT WORK OR VENDOR ORDERS FOR SUPPLIES, OPPORTUNITIES TO BID ON SUPPLY CONTRACTS, TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER FORMS OF ASSISTANCE. HOWEVER, IN CERTAIN CASES, OUR

COMMITMENTS MAY BE SATISFIED THROUGH OTHER PARTIES (SUCH AS OUR VENDORS) WHO PURCHASE SUPPLIES FROM OUR NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS. WE DO NOT COMMIT TO INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS UNLESS A CONTRACT FOR SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IS SIGNED. IN

CERTAIN CASES, PENALTIES COULD BE IMPOSED IF WE DO NOT MEET OUR INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS. DURING 2007, WE INCURRED NO SUCH PENALTIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE HAVE OUTSTANDING INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS TOTALING $8.9

BILLION THAT EXTEND THROUGH 2024. PURCHASE ORDER COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH A PURCHASE ORDER COMMITMENT FROM US, A COUNTRY OUTSIDE THE U.S. OR CUSTOMER

MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPABILITY TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS AND MUST BE COMPETITIVE IN COST, QUALITY AND SCHEDULE.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS

WE HAVE SIGNIFICANT CONTINGENT OBLIGATIONS THAT ARISE IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF BUSINESS, WHICH INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.

LEGAL

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS ARE PENDING AGAINST

US. MOST SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO MATTERS COVERED BY OUR INSURANCE. LEGAL CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED IN NOTE 21, INCLUDING OUR CONTESTING THE DEFAULT TERMINATION OF THE A-12 AIRCRAFT, EMPLOYMENT AND BENEFITS LITIGATION BROUGHT

BY SEVERAL OF OUR EMPLOYEES, AND LITIGATION/ARBITRATION INVOLVING BSSI PROGRAMS.

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

WE ARE INVOLVED WITH VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES AND HAVE RECORDED A LIABILITY OF $679 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION, SEE NOTE 13.

INCOME TAXES

WE HAVE RECORDED A NET LIABILITY OF $1,272

MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION OF THESE CONTINGENCIES, SEE NOTE 4.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

WE ARE A PARTY TO CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDING CERTAIN GUARANTEES. FOR DISCUSSION OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, SEE NOTE 12.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING INVOLVES A JUDGMENTAL PROCESS OF ESTIMATING THE TOTAL SALES AND COSTS FOR EACH CONTRACT, WHICH RESULTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES. FOR EACH CONTRACT, THE

AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED.

DUE TO THE SIZE, LENGTH OF TIME AND NATURE OF MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS, THE ESTIMATION OF TOTAL SALES AND COSTS THROUGH COMPLETION IS COMPLICATED AND SUBJECT TO MANY

VARIABLES. TOTAL CONTRACT SALES ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON NEGOTIATED CONTRACT PRICES AND QUANTITIES, MODIFIED BY OUR ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CONTRACT OPTIONS, CHANGE ORDERS, INCENTIVE AND AWARD PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE, AND PRICE

ADJUSTMENT CLAUSES (SUCH AS INFLATION OR INDEX-BASED CLAUSES). THE MAJORITY OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. GENERALLY THE PRICE IS BASED ON ESTIMATED COST TO PRODUCE THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE PLUS PROFIT. THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION

REGULATIONS PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE TYPES OF COST THAT WILL BE REIMBURSED IN ESTABLISHING CONTRACT PRICE. TOTAL CONTRACT COST ESTIMATES ARE LARGELY BASED ON NEGOTIATED OR ESTIMATED PURCHASE CONTRACT TERMS, HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS

BASE AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE INFLATIONARY TRENDS, TECHNICAL AND SCHEDULE RISK, INTERNAL AND SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS VOLUME ASSUMPTIONS, ASSET UTILIZATION, AND ANTICIPATED

LABOR AGREEMENTS.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES INVOLVES

PROCEDURES AND PERSONNEL IN ALL AREAS THAT PROVIDE FINANCIAL OR PRODUCTION INFORMATION ON THE STATUS OF CONTRACTS. ESTIMATES OF EACH SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS SALES AND COSTS ARE REVIEWED AND REASSESSED QUARTERLY. ANY CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES

RESULT IN RECOGNITION OF CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CONTRACT PROFIT IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH CHANGES ARE MADE.

DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JUDGMENT IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS LIKELY THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT COST OF SALES AMOUNTS COULD BE RECORDED IF WE USED DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS, OR IF THE

UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS/ESTIMATES, SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE, OR CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ADVERSELY OR POSITIVELY AFFECT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN FUTURE

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PERIODS. IF THE COMBINED GROSS MARGIN FOR ALL CONTRACTS IN IDS FOR ALL OF 2007 HAD BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE HIGHER OR LOWER BY 1.0%, IT WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED

PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE YEAR BY APPROXIMATELY $321 MILLION.

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES THE DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO RELIABLY

ESTIMATE THE RELATIONSHIP OF SALES TO COSTS FOR THE DEFINED PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY

UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY IS LIMITED BY THE ABILITY TO MAKE REASONABLY DEPENDABLE ESTIMATES OF THE REVENUE AND COST OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. FOR EACH PROGRAM, THE AMOUNT

REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE FOR THE TOTAL REMAINING PROGRAM TO THE AMOUNT OF SALES RECOGNIZED FOR AIRPLANES DELIVERED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER.

FACTORS THAT MUST BE ESTIMATED INCLUDE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, SALES PRICE, LABOR

AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS, MATERIAL COSTS, PROCURED PARTS, MAJOR COMPONENT COSTS, OVERHEAD COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS, AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS. ESTIMATION OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH PROGRAM TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SEVERAL FACTORS THAT ARE

INDICATIVE OF THE DEMAND FOR THE PARTICULAR PROGRAM, SUCH AS FIRM ORDERS, LETTERS OF INTENT FROM PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS, AND MARKET STUDIES. TOTAL ESTIMATED PROGRAM SALES ARE DETERMINED BY ESTIMATING THE MODEL MIX AND SALES PRICE FOR ALL UNSOLD UNITS

WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, ADDED TOGETHER WITH THE SALES FOR ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS UNDER CONTRACT. THE SALES PRICES FOR ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY INCLUDE AN ESCALATION ADJUSTMENT THAT IS BASED ON PROJECTED ESCALATION

RATES, CONSISTENT WITH TYPICAL SALES CONTRACT TERMS. COST ESTIMATES ARE BASED LARGELY ON NEGOTIATED AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS WITH SUPPLIERS, HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS, AND BUSINESS BASE AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE

THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE PRODUCTION RATES, INTERNAL AND SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, CUSTOMER AND/OR SUPPLIER CLAIMS OR ASSERTIONS, ASSET UTILIZATION, ANTICIPATED LABOR AGREEMENTS, AND INFLATIONARY TRENDS.

TO ENSURE RELIABILITY IN OUR ESTIMATES, WE EMPLOY A RIGOROUS ESTIMATING PROCESS THAT IS

REVIEWED AND UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE NORMALLY RECOGNIZED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS; WHEN ESTIMATED COSTS TO COMPLETE A PROGRAM EXCEED ESTIMATED REVENUES FROM UNDELIVERED UNITS IN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, A LOSS PROVISION

IS RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.

THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING

ALLOCATES TOOLING AND PRODUCTION COSTS OVER THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH PROGRAM. BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW PROGRAM AND SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT REQUIRED FOR INITIAL TOOLING, NEW COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE 787 PROGRAM, TYPICALLY HAVE LOWER MARGINS THAN ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS.

DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JUDGMENT IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS LIKELY THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT COST OF SALES AMOUNTS COULD BE RECORDED IF WE USED DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS, OR IF THE

UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS/ESTIMATES, OR CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ADVERSELY OR POSITIVELY AFFECT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN FUTURE PERIODS. IF COMBINED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES FOR ALL COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE

PROGRAMS FOR ALL OF 2007 HAD BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE HIGHER OR LOWER BY 1%, IT WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE YEAR BY APPROXIMATELY $278 MILLION.

AIRCRAFT VALUATION

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE

WE EVALUATE ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE EXPECTED

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW FROM THE ASSET IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. WE USE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS WHEN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW INCLUDING OUR INTENTIONS FOR HOW LONG WE WILL

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

HOLD AN ASSET SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASE BEFORE WE SELL THE ASSET, THE EXPECTED FUTURE LEASE RATES, LEASE TERMS, RESIDUAL VALUE OF THE ASSET, PERIODS IN WHICH THE

ASSET MAY BE HELD IN PREPARATION FOR A FOLLOW-ON LEASE, MAINTENANCE COSTS, REMARKETING COSTS AND THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSET.

WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE RECORDED IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF

THE ASSET.

HAD FUTURE LEASE RATES ON ASSETS EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT

BEEN 10% LOWER, WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WOULD HAVE INCURRED ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE OF $6 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007.

USED AIRCRAFT ACQUIRED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORY AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET AS IT IS OUR INTENT TO SELL THESE ASSETS. TO

MITIGATE COSTS AND ENHANCE MARKETABILITY, AIRCRAFT MAY BE PLACED ON OPERATING LEASE. WHILE ON OPERATING LEASE, THE ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER FINANCING, HOWEVER, THE VALUATION CONTINUES TO BE BASED ON THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES

THE

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES (VALUATION PROVISION) IS USED TO PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF RECEIVABLES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE BALANCE REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE BUT UNCONFIRMED LOSSES IN THE

RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO. THE ESTIMATE IS BASED ON VARIOUS QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, COLLATERAL VALUES, AND RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL CREDIT AND COLLECTIBILITY REVIEWS. THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE IS

ASSESSED QUARTERLY.

TWO OF THE MAJOR FACTORS INFLUENCING THE LEVEL OF

OUR ALLOWANCE ARE CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS AND COLLATERAL VALUES. IF EACH CUSTOMERS CREDIT RATING WERE INCREASED OR DECREASED BY ONE MAJOR RATING CATEGORY AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE ALLOWANCE WOULD HAVE DECREASED BY $22 MILLION OR INCREASED

BY $49 MILLION. IF THE COLLATERAL VALUES WERE 10% LOWER AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE ALLOWANCE WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY $27 MILLION.

LEASE RESIDUAL VALUES

EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES IS CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND IS DEPRECIATED TO ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE

USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD THAT WE PROJECT WE WILL HOLD THE ASSET FOR LEASE. ESTIMATES USED IN DETERMINING RESIDUAL VALUES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE FOR EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES.

IF THE ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES DECLINED 5% AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THIS WOULD RESULT IN A FUTURE CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX EARNINGS IMPACT OF $105 MILLION RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING DEPRECIABLE PERIODS, OF WHICH $10 MILLION WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN

2008.

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENTS

GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED

BUT ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY, AND WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SUCH THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. OUR ANNUAL TESTING DATE IS APRIL 1. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY FIRST COMPARING

THE BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN BOOK VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. IN THIS PROCESS, A FAIR VALUE FOR GOODWILL IS

ESTIMATED, BASED IN PART ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPERATIONS, AND IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE SHORTFALL OF THE FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.

WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS.

FORECASTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE SALES AND OPERATING COSTS, BASED PRIMARILY ON EXISTING FIRM ORDERS, EXPECTED FUTURE ORDERS, CONTRACTS WITH SUPPLIERS, LABOR AGREEMENTS, AND GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN

THESE FORECASTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT RECORDED, IF ANY.

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE CASH FLOW FORECASTS ARE ADJUSTED BY AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE DERIVED FROM OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION PLUS A

SUITABLE CONTROL PREMIUM AT THE DATE OF EVALUATION. THEREFORE, CHANGES IN THE STOCK PRICE MAY ALSO AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT RECORDED. AT THE DATE OF OUR PREVIOUS IMPAIRMENT TEST, A 10% INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK

WOULD HAVE HAD NO IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLES CONSIST OF BRAND AND TRADE NAMES ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WE TEST THESE INTANGIBLES FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUE TO CURRENT PROJECTIONS OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BRAND AND TRADE NAMES. ANY

EXCESS CARRYING VALUE OVER THE AMOUNT OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. A 10% DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WOULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $11 MILLION.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

WE HAVE DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OUR EMPLOYEES. WE ALSO HAVE OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS CONSISTING

PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTHCARE COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS. ACCOUNTING RULES REQUIRE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF OUR PROJECTED OBLIGATIONS AND PLAN ASSETS. THESE MEASUREMENTS REQUIRE SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF

WHICH ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN, AND MEDICAL TREND RATE (RATE OF GROWTH FOR MEDICAL COSTS). CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FUTURE ANNUAL EXPENSE. IN ADDITION, AS RESULT OF OUR ADOPTION OF

SFAS 158, DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS ON ASSETS, CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS, AND CHANGES IN PLAN PROVISIONS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (NET OF TAXES) AT FUTURE MEASUREMENT DATES.

WE USE A DISCOUNT RATE THAT IS BASED ON A POINT-IN-TIME ESTIMATE AS OF OUR

SEPTEMBER 30 ANNUAL MEASUREMENT DATE. CHANGES IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WILL INCREASE OR DECREASE OUR RECORDED LIABILITIES WITH A CORRESPONDING ADJUSTMENT TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, WE SHOW THE

SENSITIVITY OF OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN LIABILITIES AND NET PERIODIC COST TO A 25 BASIS POINT CHANGE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE RISK

WE HAVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK, PRINCIPALLY INVESTMENTS, FIXED-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, AND CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED MATERIAL GAINS OR LOSSES ON THESE INSTRUMENTS DUE TO

INTEREST RATE CHANGES. ADDITIONALLY, BCC USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

THE PRINCIPAL SOURCE OF BCCS MARKET RISK RELATES TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES. THIS RISK IS MANAGED BY MATCHING THE PROFILE OF BCCS LIABILITIES WITH THE

PROFILE OF BCCS ASSETS. EXPOSURE TO MISMATCHED RISK IS MEASURED AND MANAGED WITH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES. WE DO NOT USE INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES FOR SPECULATIVE OR TRADING PURPOSES. ALTHOUGH MANY OF THE ASSETS, LIABILITIES AND

DERIVATIVES AFFECTED BY A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES ARE NOT TRADED, IF WE HAD AN IMMEDIATE, ONE-TIME, 100 BASIS-POINT INCREASE IN MARKET RATES AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE ESTIMATE THAT THE TAX-ADJUSTED NET FAIR VALUE OF THESE ITEMS WOULD HAVE

DECREASED BY $12 MILLION COMPARED TO A DECREASE OF $9 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2006.

BASED ON THE PORTFOLIO OF OTHER BOEING EXISTING DEBT, THE UNHEDGED EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IS NOT MATERIAL. THE INVESTORS IN THE FIXED-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT WE ISSUE DO NOT GENERALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEMAND WE PAY

OFF THESE OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO MATURITY. THEREFORE, EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IS NOT BELIEVED TO BE MATERIAL FOR OUR FIXED-RATE DEBT.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK RELATING TO RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE

PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FIRMLY COMMITTED AND FORECASTED FOREIGN DENOMINATED PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS RELATED TO OUR ONGOING BUSINESS. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007,

A 10% UNFAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENT IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS WOULD HAVE REDUCED OUR UNREALIZED GAINS BY $69 MILLION. CONSISTENT WITH THE USE OF THESE CONTRACTS TO NEUTRALIZE THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, SUCH

UNREALIZED LOSSES OR GAINS WOULD BE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING GAINS OR LOSSES, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE REMEASUREMENT OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED. WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE FORWARD CURRENCY CONTRACTS AND THE OFFSETTING UNDERLYING

COMMITMENTS DO NOT CREATE MATERIAL MARKET RISK.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006,

2005

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF ALL MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE CONSOLIDATED.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES FOR WHICH CHANGES IN THE NEAR TERM ARE CONSIDERED REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL

IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DISCLOSED IN THESE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OPERATING CYCLE

FOR CLASSIFICATION OF

CERTAIN CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WE USE THE DURATION OF THE RELATED CONTRACT OR PROGRAM AS OUR OPERATING CYCLE, WHICH IS GENERALLY LONGER THAN ONE YEAR AND COULD EXCEED 3 YEARS.

REVENUE AND RELATED COST RECOGNITION

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING IS USED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES PREDOMINANTLY BY THE THREE SEGMENTS WITHIN INTEGRATED DEFENSE

SYSTEMS (IDS). THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS: MILITARY AIRCRAFT, HELICOPTERS, MISSILES, SPACE SYSTEMS, MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS, SATELLITES, AND INFORMATION AND BATTLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. THE MAJORITY OF BUSINESS

CONDUCTED IN THE IDS SEGMENTS IS PERFORMED UNDER CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTS THAT EXTEND OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. CONTRACT ACCOUNTING INVOLVES A JUDGMENTAL PROCESS OF ESTIMATING THE TOTAL SALES AND COSTS FOR EACH

CONTRACT RESULTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES. FOR EACH CONTRACT, THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED.

WE COMBINE CONTRACTS FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES WHEN THEY ARE NEGOTIATED AS A PACKAGE

WITH AN OVERALL PROFIT MARGIN OBJECTIVE, THEY ESSENTIALLY REPRESENT AN AGREEMENT TO DO A SINGLE PROJECT FOR A SINGLE CUSTOMER, THEY INVOLVE INTERRELATED CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL COMMON COSTS, AND THEY ARE PERFORMED CONCURRENTLY OR

SEQUENTIALLY. WHEN A GROUP OF CONTRACTS IS COMBINED, REVENUE AND PROFIT ARE EARNED UNIFORMLY OVER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBINED CONTRACTS.

SALES RELATED TO CONTRACTS WITH FIXED PRICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS DELIVERIES ARE MADE, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE

OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD BEFORE DELIVERIES BEGIN, FOR WHICH SALES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE MILESTONES. SALES RELATED TO CONTRACTS IN WHICH WE ARE REIMBURSED FOR COSTS INCURRED PLUS AN AGREED UPON PROFIT ARE RECORDED AS

COSTS ARE INCURRED. THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE TYPES OF COST THAT WILL BE REIMBURSED IN ESTABLISHING CONTRACT PRICE. CONTRACTS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS TO EARN INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES IF SPECIFIED TARGETS ARE

ACHIEVED. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND ARE PROBABLE ARE RECORDED OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD OF THE CONTRACT. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED ARE RECORDED WHEN AWARDED.

53

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT PREDOMINANTLY USES PROGRAM ACCOUNTING TO ACCOUNT FOR

COST OF SALES RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAMS. PROGRAM ACCOUNTING IS A METHOD OF ACCOUNTING APPLICABLE TO PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED FOR DELIVERY UNDER PRODUCTION-TYPE CONTRACTS WHERE PROFITABILITY IS REALIZED OVER MULTIPLE CONTRACTS AND YEARS.

UNDER PROGRAM ACCOUNTING, INVENTORIABLE PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS, AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED AND CHARGED TO COST OF SALES BY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF BY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR CONTRACTS. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED

NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY IS LIMITED BY THE ABILITY TO MAKE

REASONABLY DEPENDABLE ESTIMATES OF THE REVENUE AND COST OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP OF SALES TO COST OF SALES, PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF (A) THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN

A PROGRAM, (B) THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE UNITS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED, AND (C) THE UNITS EXPECTED SALES PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING, AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM.

WE RECOGNIZE SALES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DELIVERIES AS EACH UNIT IS COMPLETED AND

ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. SALES RECOGNIZED REPRESENT THE PRICE NEGOTIATED WITH THE CUSTOMER, ADJUSTED BY AN ESCALATION FORMULA AS SPECIFIED IN THE CUSTOMER AGREEMENT. THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST

OF SALES PERCENTAGE FOR THE TOTAL REMAINING PROGRAM TO THE AMOUNT OF SALES RECOGNIZED FOR AIRPLANES DELIVERED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER.

CONCESSION SHARING ARRANGEMENTS

WE ACCOUNT FOR SALES CONCESSIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN CONSIDERATION OF THEIR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AS A REDUCTION

TO REVENUE (SALES CONCESSIONS) WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DELIVERED. THE SALES CONCESSIONS INCURRED MAY BE PARTIALLY REIMBURSED BY CERTAIN SUPPLIERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONCESSION SHARING ARRANGEMENTS. WE RECORD THESE REIMBURSEMENTS,

WHICH ARE PRESUMED TO REPRESENT REDUCTIONS IN THE PRICE OF THE VENDORS PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AS A REDUCTION IN COST OF PRODUCTS.

SPARE PARTS REVENUE

WE RECOGNIZE SALES OF SPARE PARTS UPON DELIVERY AND THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS RECORDED AT AVERAGE COST.

SERVICE REVENUE

SERVICE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED IN SALES OF SERVICES WHEN THE

SERVICE IS PERFORMED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT SERVICE AGREEMENTS, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING CONTRACT ACCOUNTING. SERVICE ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: DELTA LAUNCHES, ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION

AND SPACE SHUTTLE, SUPPORT AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND HELICOPTER CONTRACTS, AND TECHNICAL AND FLIGHT OPERATION SERVICES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. LEASE AND FINANCING REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN SALES OF SERVICES ON

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. SERVICE REVENUE AND ASSOCIATED COST OF SALES FROM PAY-IN-ADVANCE SUBSCRIPTION FEES ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED.

FINANCIAL SERVICES REVENUE

WE RECORD FINANCIAL SERVICES REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH SALES-TYPE FINANCE LEASES, OPERATING LEASES,

AND NOTES RECEIVABLE.

FOR SALES-TYPE FINANCE LEASES, WE RECORD AN ASSET

AT LEASE INCEPTION. THIS ASSET IS RECORDED AT THE AGGREGATE FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS, ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OF THE LEASED EQUIPMENT, AND DEFERRED INCREMENTAL DIRECT COSTS LESS UNEARNED INCOME. INCOME IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE LEASE

TO APPROXIMATE A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN ON THE NET INVESTMENT. RESIDUAL VALUES, WHICH ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY, REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE AT LEASE TERMINATION FROM THE DISPOSITION OF THE LEASED EQUIPMENT. ACTUAL RESIDUAL

VALUES REALIZED COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. DECLINES IN ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE THAT ARE DEEMED OTHER THAN TEMPORARY ARE RECOGNIZED AS COST OF SERVICES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DECLINES OCCUR.

FOR OPERATING LEASES, REVENUE ON LEASED AIRCRAFT AND EQUIPMENT IS RECORDED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE. OPERATING LEASE ASSETS, INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER FINANCING, ARE RECORDED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED OVER THE PERIOD THAT WE PROJECT WE WILL HOLD THE ASSET TO AN ESTIMATED RESIDUAL

54

TABLE OF CONTENTS

VALUE, USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. PREPAYMENTS RECEIVED ON OPERATING LEASE CONTRACTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS DEFERRED LEASE INCOME ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF

FINANCIAL POSITION. WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR ESTIMATES OF RESIDUAL VALUE AND RECOGNIZE FORECASTED CHANGES BY PROSPECTIVELY ADJUSTING DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.

FOR NOTES RECEIVABLE, NOTES ARE RECORDED NET OF ANY UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNTS AND DEFERRED INCREMENTAL DIRECT COSTS. INTEREST INCOME AND AMORTIZATION OF ANY DISCOUNTS

ARE RECORDED RATABLY OVER THE RELATED TERM OF THE NOTE.

REINSURANCE

REVENUE

OUR WHOLLY-OWNED INSURANCE SUBSIDIARY, ASTRO LTD., PARTICIPATES IN A REINSURANCE POOL FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION. THE MEMBER AGREEMENTS AND PRACTICES OF THE REINSURANCE POOL MINIMIZE ANY PARTICIPATING MEMBERS INDIVIDUAL RISK.

REINSURANCE REVENUES WERE $84, $84, AND $101 DURING 2007, 2006, AND 2005 RESPECTIVELY. REINSURANCE COSTS RELATED TO PREMIUMS AND CLAIMS PAID TO THE REINSURANCE POOL WERE $93, $91, AND $115 DURING 2007, 2006, AND 2005 RESPECTIVELY. REVENUES AND COSTS

ARE PRESENTED NET IN COST OF SERVICES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

FLEET SUPPORT

WE PROVIDE THE OPERATORS OF ALL OUR

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE MODELS ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES TO FACILITATE EFFICIENT AND SAFE AIRCRAFT OPERATION. COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS FLEET SUPPORT SERVICES, THESE ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES INCLUDE FLIGHT AND MAINTENANCE TRAINING, FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT,

ENGINEERING SERVICES, AND TECHNICAL DATA AND DOCUMENTS. FLEET SUPPORT ACTIVITY BEGINS PRIOR TO AIRCRAFT DELIVERY AS THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES TRAINING, MANUALS, AND TECHNICAL CONSULTING SUPPORT, AND CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE OPERATIONAL LIFE OF THE

AIRCRAFT. SERVICES PROVIDED AFTER DELIVERY INCLUDE FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT, CONSULTING ON MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES BROUGHT FORTH BY THE CUSTOMER OR REGULATORS, UPDATING MANUALS AND ENGINEERING DATA, AND THE ISSUANCE OF SERVICE

BULLETINS THAT IMPACT THE ENTIRE MODELS FLEET. FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT INVOLVES OUR PERSONNEL LOCATED AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES PROVIDING AND COORDINATING FLEET SUPPORT ACTIVITIES AND REQUESTS. THE COSTS FOR FLEET SUPPORT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED

AS COST OF SERVICES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INCLUDES COSTS INCURRED FOR EXPERIMENTATION, DESIGN, TESTING,

AND BID AND PROPOSAL EFFORTS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED UNLESS THE COSTS ARE RELATED TO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS. COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED PURSUANT TO SUCH CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE RECORDED

OVER THE PERIOD THAT REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED, CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONTRACT ACCOUNTING POLICY. WE HAVE CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT MEET THE REQUIREMENT FOR BEST EFFORTS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTING. ACCORDINGLY, THE

AMOUNTS FUNDED BY THE CUSTOMER ARE RECOGNIZED AS AN OFFSET TO OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE RATHER THAN AS CONTRACT REVENUES.

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOME SUPPLIERS FOR THE 787 PROGRAM, WHICH HAVE ENHANCED OUR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES AND HAVE OFFSET A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL RISK OF DEVELOPING THIS AIRCRAFT. OUR COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS EXPLICITLY STATE THAT THE SUPPLIER CONTRIBUTIONS ARE FOR REIMBURSEMENTS OF COSTS WE INCUR FOR EXPERIMENTATION, BASIC DESIGN, AND TESTING ACTIVITIES

DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 787. IN EACH ARRANGEMENT, WE RETAIN SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS TO THE 787 PART OR COMPONENT COVERED BY THE ARRANGEMENT. THE AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM THESE COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES SINCE WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO REFUND ANY AMOUNTS RECEIVED PER THE ARRANGEMENTS REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. SPECIFICALLY, UNDER THE TERMS OF EACH AGREEMENT, PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS FOR THEIR

SHARE OF THE COSTS ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON MILESTONES AND ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED

55

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WHEN WE ACHIEVE THE MILESTONE EVENTS AND NO ONGOING OBLIGATION ON OUR PART EXISTS. IN THE EVENT WE RECEIVE A MILESTONE PAYMENT PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE

MILESTONE, THE AMOUNT IS CLASSIFIED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES UNTIL EARNED.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

OUR PRIMARY TYPES OF

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION CONSIST OF PERFORMANCE SHARES, SHAREVALUE TRUST DISTRIBUTIONS, STOCK OPTIONS, AND OTHER STOCK UNIT AWARDS. IN 2005, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

(SFAS

NO. 123R) USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE METHOD.

INCOME TAXES

PROVISIONS FOR FEDERAL, STATE, AND NON-U.S. INCOME TAXES ARE CALCULATED ON REPORTED

EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES BASED ON CURRENT TAX LAW AND ALSO INCLUDE, IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ANY CHANGES IN TAX RATES FROM THOSE USED PREVIOUSLY IN DETERMINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. SUCH PROVISIONS DIFFER

FROM THE AMOUNTS CURRENTLY RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE BECAUSE CERTAIN ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE RECOGNIZED IN DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES THAN FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING

INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND EVALUATING TAX POSITIONS.

EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2007, WE ADOPTED FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. (FIN) 48,

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES

(FIN 48), WHICH REQUIRES A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THRESHOLD FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT

RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. WE RECORD A LIABILITY FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BENEFIT RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED PURSUANT TO FIN 48 AND THE TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN ON

OUR TAX RETURN. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR ASSESSMENT OF SUCH TAX POSITIONS CHANGES, THE CHANGE IN ESTIMATE IS RECORDED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DETERMINATION IS MADE. PRIOR TO 2007, WE ESTABLISHED CONTINGENCIES FOR INCOME TAX WHEN, DESPITE THE BELIEF

THAT OUR TAX POSITIONS WERE FULLY SUPPORTABLE, WE BELIEVED THAT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT OUR POSITIONS WOULD BE CHALLENGED AND POSSIBLY DISALLOWED BY VARIOUS AUTHORITIES. THE CONSOLIDATED TAX PROVISION AND RELATED ACCRUALS INCLUDED THE IMPACT OF SUCH

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE LOSSES AND RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE.

WITH THE ADOPTION OF FIN 48, WE ALSO BEGAN REPORTING TAX-RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE. PRIOR TO 2007, INCOME TAX-RELATED INTEREST INCOME WAS CLASSIFIED AS OTHER INCOME, NET, WHEREAS,

TAX-RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE AND PENALTIES WERE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

WE SPONSOR VARIOUS PENSION PLANS

COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES. WE ALSO PROVIDE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS. BENEFITS UNDER THE PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AGE AT RETIREMENT AND YEARS OF SERVICE AND FOR SOME PENSION PLANS, BENEFITS ARE ALSO BASED ON THE EMPLOYEES ANNUAL EARNINGS. THE NET PERIODIC COST OF OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

PLANS IS DETERMINED USING THE PROJECTED UNIT CREDIT METHOD AND SEVERAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN, AND MEDICAL TREND (RATE OF GROWTH FOR MEDICAL COSTS). A PORTION OF

NET PERIODIC PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT INCOME OR EXPENSE IS NOT RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS IN THE YEAR INCURRED BECAUSE IT IS ALLOCATED TO PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT COSTS, AND REFLECTED IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD. IF GAINS AND

LOSSES, WHICH OCCUR WHEN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE DIFFERS FROM ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, EXCEED TEN PERCENT OF THE GREATER OF PLAN ASSETS OR PLAN LIABILITIES WE AMORTIZE THEM OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD OF EMPLOYEES.

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE ADOPTED SFAS NO. 158,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR DEFINED BENEFIT

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS  AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENTS NO. 87, 88, 106 AND 132(R)

(SFAS NO. 158) WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION REFLECT THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PENSION

AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS.

POSTEMPLOYMENT PLANS

WE RECORD A LIABILITY FOR POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, SUCH AS SEVERANCE OR JOB TRAINING,

WHEN PAYMENT IS PROBABLE, THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, AND THE OBLIGATION RELATES TO RIGHTS THAT HAVE VESTED OR ACCUMULATED.

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THOSE FOR DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES. WE ROUTINELY ASSESS, BASED ON

IN-DEPTH STUDIES, EXPERT ANALYSES AND LEGAL REVIEWS, OUR CONTINGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS, AND COMMITMENTS FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RANGES AND PROBABILITIES OF RECOVERIES FROM OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO HAVE AND

HAVE NOT AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT AND OF RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS. OUR POLICY IS TO ACCRUE AND CHARGE TO CURRENT EXPENSE IDENTIFIED EXPOSURES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SITES BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE WITHIN A RANGE OF POTENTIAL

EXPOSURE FOR INVESTIGATION, CLEANUP, AND MONITORING COSTS TO BE INCURRED. ESTIMATED REMEDIATION COSTS ARE NOT DISCOUNTED TO PRESENT VALUE AS THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. WE MAY BE ABLE TO RECOVER A PORTION OF THE

REMEDIATION COSTS FROM INSURERS OR OTHER THIRD-PARTIES; SUCH RECOVERIES ARE RECORDED WHEN REALIZATION OF THE CLAIM FOR RECOVERY IS DEEMED PROBABLE.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF HIGHLY LIQUID INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, TIME DEPOSITS, AND OTHER MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS, WHICH HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF LESS

THAN THREE MONTHS. WE AGGREGATE OUR CASH BALANCES BY BANK, AND RECLASSIFY ANY NEGATIVE BALANCES TO ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIED COSTS ON COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTS INCLUDE DIRECT ENGINEERING, PRODUCTION AND TOOLING COSTS, AND APPLICABLE OVERHEAD, WHICH INCLUDES FRINGE BENEFITS, PRODUCTION RELATED INDIRECT AND PLANT

MANAGEMENT SALARIES AND PLANT SERVICES, NOT IN EXCESS OF ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE. TO THE EXTENT A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF SUCH COSTS ARE RELATED TO AN ABNORMAL EVENT OR ARE FIXED COSTS NOT APPROPRIATELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR PROGRAMS OR CONTRACTS,

THEY ARE EXPENSED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD RATHER THAN INVENTORIED. INVENTORIED COSTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS RELATING TO PROGRAMS AND CONTRACTS WITH LONG-TERM PRODUCTION CYCLES, A PORTION OF WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED WITHIN ONE YEAR. INCLUDED IN

INVENTORY FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS IS AN ALLOCATION OF ALLOWABLE COSTS RELATED TO MANUFACTURING PROCESS REENGINEERING. WE NET ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS ON LONG-TERM CONTRACTS AGAINST COSTS INCURRED TO DATE FOR EACH CONTRACT IN THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. CONTRACTS WHERE COSTS INCURRED TO DATE EXCEED ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS ARE REPORTED IN INVENTORIES, NET OF ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS. CONTRACTS WHERE ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS EXCEED

COSTS INCURRED TO DATE ARE REPORTED IN ADVANCES AND BILLINGS IN EXCESS OF RELATED COSTS.

BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW OR DERIVATIVE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAM (KNOWN AS THE LEARNING CURVE EFFECT), THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED FOR PRODUCTION OF THE EARLY UNITS IN

THE PROGRAM MAY EXCEED THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES FOR THOSE UNITS. IN ADDITION, THE USE OF A TOTAL PROGRAM GROSS PROFIT RATE TO DELIVERED UNITS MAY RESULT IN COSTS

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSIGNED TO DELIVERED UNITS IN A REPORTING PERIOD BEING LESS THAN THE ACTUAL COST OF THOSE UNITS. THE EXCESS ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED OVER THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF

SALES IS DISCLOSED AS DEFERRED PRODUCTION COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORY ALONG WITH UNAMORTIZED TOOLING COSTS.

THE DETERMINATION OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF LONG-TERM CONTRACT COSTS IS BASED UPON QUARTERLY CONTRACT REVIEWS THAT DETERMINE AN ESTIMATE OF COSTS TO BE INCURRED TO

COMPLETE ALL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS. WHEN ACTUAL CONTRACT COSTS AND THE ESTIMATE TO COMPLETE EXCEED TOTAL ESTIMATED CONTRACT REVENUES, A LOSS PROVISION IS RECORDED. THE DETERMINATION OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAM COSTS IS

BASED UPON QUARTERLY PROGRAM REVIEWS THAT DETERMINE AN ESTIMATE OF REVENUE AND COST TO BE INCURRED TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. WHEN ESTIMATED COSTS TO COMPLETE EXCEED ESTIMATED PROGRAM REVENUES TO GO, A LOSS PROVISION IS RECORDED.

USED AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT AND GENERAL

STOCK MATERIALS ARE STATED AT COST NOT IN EXCESS OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE. SEE AIRCRAFT VALUATION WITHIN THIS NOTE FOR OUR VALUATION OF USED AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT. SPARE PARTS INVENTORY IS STATED AT LOWER

OF AVERAGE UNIT COST OR MARKET. WE REVIEW OUR COMMERCIAL SPARE PARTS AND GENERAL STOCK MATERIALS EACH QUARTER TO IDENTIFY IMPAIRED INVENTORY, INCLUDING EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY, BASED ON HISTORICAL SALES TRENDS, EXPECTED PRODUCTION USAGE, AND

THE SIZE AND AGE OF THE AIRCRAFT FLEET USING THE PART. IMPAIRED INVENTORIES ARE CHARGED TO COST OF PRODUCTS IN THE PERIOD THE IMPAIRMENT OCCURS.

INCLUDED IN INVENTORY FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS ARE AMOUNTS PAID OR CREDITED IN CASH, OR OTHER CONSIDERATION TO CERTAIN AIRLINE CUSTOMERS, THAT ARE REFERRED

TO AS EARLY ISSUE SALES CONSIDERATION. EARLY ISSUE SALES CONSIDERATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE WHEN THE DELIVERY OF THE AIRCRAFT UNDER CONTRACT OCCURS. IN THE UNLIKELY SITUATION THAT AN AIRLINE CUSTOMER WAS NOT ABLE TO PERFORM AND

TAKE DELIVERY OF THE CONTRACTED AIRCRAFT, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS PAID THROUGH RETAINING AMOUNTS SECURED BY ADVANCES RECEIVED ON AIRCRAFT TO BE DELIVERED. HOWEVER, TO THE EXTENT EARLY ISSUE SALES CONSIDERATION

EXCEEDS ADVANCES AND IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE RECOVERABLE, IT WOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS A CURRENT PERIOD EXPENSE.

PRECONTRACT COSTS

WE MAY, FROM TIME TO

TIME, INCUR COSTS TO BEGIN FULFILLING THE STATEMENT OF WORK UNDER A SPECIFIC ANTICIPATED CONTRACT THAT WE ARE STILL NEGOTIATING WITH A CUSTOMER. IF WE DETERMINE IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE AWARDED THE SPECIFIC ANTICIPATED CONTRACT, THEN WE

CAPITALIZE THE PRECONTRACT COSTS WE INCUR, EXCLUDING ANY START-UP COSTS WHICH ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. CAPITALIZED PRECONTRACT COSTS OF $27 AND $40 AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORIES, NET OF ADVANCES AND PROGRESS

BILLINGS, IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST, INCLUDING APPLICABLE CONSTRUCTION-PERIOD INTEREST, LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND ARE DEPRECIATED PRINCIPALLY OVER THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES: NEW BUILDINGS AND LAND IMPROVEMENTS, FROM 10 TO 40 YEARS; AND

NEW MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, FROM 3 TO 20 YEARS. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF DEPRECIATION ARE AS FOLLOWS: BUILDINGS AND LAND IMPROVEMENTS, 150% DECLINING BALANCE; AND MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS. CAPITALIZED INTERNAL USE

SOFTWARE IS INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS AND AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT LINE METHOD OVER FIVE YEARS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF REMAINING DEPRECIABLE LIVES ASSIGNED TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING ASSETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO A

MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR DISPOSITION.

WE REVIEW LONG-LIVED ASSETS, WHICH

INCLUDES PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, FOR IMPAIRMENT IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

(SFAS NO. 144). LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR SALE ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST

OR FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SELL. LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR USE ARE SUBJECT TO AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE

RECOVERABLE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS NO LONGER RECOVERABLE BASED UPON THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

ON DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE ADOPTED FIN NO. 47,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS  AN

INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 143

(FIN 47).

IN ACCORDANCE WITH FIN 47, WE RECORD ALL KNOWN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH THE LIABILITYS FAIR VALUE CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, INCLUDING CERTAIN ASBESTOS REMOVAL,

ASSET DECOMMISSIONING AND CONTRACTUAL LEASE RESTORATION OBLIGATIONS. RECORDED AMOUNTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.

WE ALSO HAVE KNOWN CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, SUCH AS CERTAIN ASBESTOS REMEDIATION AND ASSET DECOMMISSIONING ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN THE FUTURE, THAT ARE NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE DUE

TO INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE TIMING AND METHOD OF SETTLEMENT OF THE OBLIGATION. ACCORDINGLY, THESE OBLIGATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A LIABILITY FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS WILL BE RECORDED IN THE PERIOD

WHEN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION REGARDING TIMING AND METHOD OF SETTLEMENT BECOMES AVAILABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LIABILITYS FAIR VALUE. IN ADDITION, THERE MAY BE CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE NOT YET

DISCOVERED (E.G. ASBESTOS MAY EXIST IN CERTAIN BUILDINGS BUT WE HAVE NOT BECOME AWARE OF IT THROUGH THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS), AND THEREFORE, THESE OBLIGATIONS ALSO HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED,

BUT ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SUCH THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. OUR ANNUAL TESTING DATE IS APRIL 1.

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY FIRST COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN CARRYING VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. IN THIS PROCESS, A FAIR VALUE FOR GOODWILL IS ESTIMATED, BASED IN PART ON

THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPERATIONS, AND IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE SHORTFALL OF THE FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES CONSIST OF BRAND AND TRADE NAMES ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WE TEST THESE INTANGIBLES FOR IMPAIRMENT BY

COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUE TO CURRENT PROJECTIONS OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BRAND AND TRADE NAMES. ANY EXCESS CARRYING VALUE OVER THE AMOUNT OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT.

OUR FINITE-LIVED ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER

THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AS FOLLOWS: DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY, 5 TO 12 YEARS; PRODUCT KNOW-HOW, 30 YEARS; CUSTOMER BASE, 12 TO 15 YEARS; DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS, 6 TO 30 YEARS; AND OTHER, 2 TO 17 YEARS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144, WE EVALUATE

THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF FINITE-LIVED ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHEN APPROPRIATE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS NO LONGER RECOVERABLE BASED UPON THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVESTMENTS

WE CLASSIFY INVESTMENT SECURITIES AS EITHER HELD-TO-MATURITY OR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES INCLUDE COMMERCIAL PAPER AND ARE CARRIED AT

AMORTIZED COST.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES INCLUDE MARKETABLE DEBT

AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND ENHANCED EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES (EETCS) AND ARE RECORDED AT THEIR FAIR VALUES, WITH UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED AS PART OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

POSITION. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE COST OF SECURITIES USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON ALL OTHER AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON SPECIFIC

IDENTIFICATION.

THE FAIR VALUE OF MARKETABLE SECURITIES IS BASED ON

QUOTED MARKET PRICES. THE FAIR VALUE OF NON-PUBLICLY TRADED SECURITIES, INCLUDING CERTAIN EETCS, IS BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS AT MARKET YIELD. IN CASES WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT RECOVERY OF OUR INVESTMENT WILL COME FROM

RECOVERY OF COLLATERAL, THE FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES ARE ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT QUARTERLY. TO DETERMINE IF AN IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, WE CONSIDER THE DURATION AND SEVERITY OF THE LOSS POSITION, THE STRENGTH OF THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL, THE TERM TO MATURITY, AND CREDIT RATING. FOR INVESTMENTS THAT ARE DEEMED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, LOSSES ARE RECORDED IN COST OF PRODUCTS OR COST OF SERVICES AND PAYMENTS RECEIVED ON THESE INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED USING THE COST

RECOVERY METHOD.

THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IS USED TO ACCOUNT FOR

INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER AN INVESTEE. SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE IS GENERALLY DEEMED TO EXIST IF WE HAVE AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE VOTING STOCK OF AN INVESTEE OF BETWEEN 20% AND

50%.

WE CLASSIFY INVESTMENT INCOME AND LOSS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OPERATING OR NON-OPERATING IN NATURE. OPERATING INVESTMENTS ALIGN STRATEGICALLY AND ARE INTEGRATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS. EARNINGS FROM OPERATING INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING OUR SHARE OF INCOME OR

LOSS FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, DIVIDEND INCOME FROM CERTAIN COST METHOD INVESTMENTS, AND ANY GAIN/LOSS ON THE DISPOSITION OF THESE INVESTMENTS, ARE RECORDED IN INCOME FROM OPERATING INVESTMENTS, NET. NON-OPERATING INVESTMENTS ARE THOSE WE HOLD

FOR NON-STRATEGIC PURPOSES. EARNINGS FROM NON-OPERATING INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES, ARE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME, NET.

DERIVATIVES

ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE REGARDLESS OF THE PURPOSE OR INTENT OF HOLDING THEM. WE USE

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO PRINCIPALLY MANAGE A VARIETY OF MARKET RISKS. WE RECORD OUR INTEREST RATE SWAPS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE DERIVATIVES AND COMMODITY CONTRACTS AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSES. FOR DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS

HEDGES OF THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RECOGNIZED ASSET OR LIABILITY OR A FIRM COMMITMENT (REFERRED TO AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES), THE GAIN OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE OFFSETTING LOSS OR

GAIN ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. THE EFFECT OF THAT ACCOUNTING IS TO INCLUDE IN EARNINGS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HEDGE IS NOT EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE. FOR OUR CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE

EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE DERIVATIVES GAIN OR LOSS IS INITIALLY REPORTED IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS) AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING

WHICH THE HEDGED FORECASTED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS OF A CASH FLOW HEDGE IS REPORTED IN EARNINGS IMMEDIATELY. WE ALSO HOLD CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS FOR ECONOMIC PURPOSES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED FOR HEDGE

ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. FOR THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, THE CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR VALUE ARE ALSO RECORDED IN EARNINGS AS OTHER INCOME, NET.

AIRCRAFT VALUATION

USED AIRCRAFT UNDER TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS AND AIRCRAFT UNDER REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNING A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF NEW

AIRCRAFT (SALE AIRCRAFT), WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SPECIFIED-PRICE TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO TRADE IN USED AIRCRAFT UPON THE PURCHASE OF SALE AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CONTINGENT

REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS WHEREIN WE AGREE TO REPURCHASE THE SALE AIRCRAFT AT A SPECIFIED PRICE, GENERALLY TEN YEARS AFTER DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT. OUR REPURCHASE OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT IS CONTINGENT UPON A FUTURE, MUTUALLY

ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT. IF WE EXECUTE AN AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT, AND IF THE CUSTOMER EXERCISES ITS RIGHT TO SELL THE SALE AIRCRAFT TO US, A CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENT WOULD

BECOME A TRADE-IN COMMITMENT. OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE IS THAT NO CONTINGENT REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS HAVE BECOME TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS.

ALL TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006 ARE SOLELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALE AIRCRAFT AND DID NOT ORIGINATE FROM CONTINGENT REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS.

EXPOSURE RELATED TO TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS MAY TAKE THE FORM OF.

(1)

ADJUSTMENTS TO REVENUE FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN PRICE IN THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT AND OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TRADE-IN

AIRCRAFT AS OF THE DATE OF SUCH AGREEMENT, WOULD BE RECORDED IN INVENTORY AND RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT, AND/OR

(2)

CHARGES TO COST OF PRODUCTS FOR ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT THAT OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR SALE AIRCRAFT BUT

PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE OF THE USED TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT. ESTIMATES BASED ON CURRENT AIRCRAFT VALUES WOULD BE INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES.

THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT IS DETERMINED USING AIRCRAFT SPECIFIC DATA SUCH AS MODEL, AGE AND CONDITION, MARKET CONDITIONS FOR

SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT AND SIMILAR MODELS, AND MULTIPLE VALUATION SOURCES. THIS PROCESS USES OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE MARKET FOR EACH TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT, WHICH IN MOST INSTANCES BEGINS YEARS BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE AIRCRAFT. THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE

MARKETS IN WHICH WE CONTINUALLY PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO PLACE USED AIRCRAFT. THESE MARKETS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE RESALE MARKET, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY INCLUDE THE COST OF LONG-TERM STORAGE; THE LEASING MARKET, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR

REFURBISHMENT COSTS TO MEET THE LEASING CUSTOMERS REQUIREMENTS; OR THE SCRAP MARKET. TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT VALUATION VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON WHICH MARKET WE DETERMINE IS MOST LIKELY FOR EACH AIRCRAFT. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE UPDATE OUR

VALUATION ANALYSIS BASED ON THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH PLACING EACH AIRCRAFT INTO A MARKET. THIS QUARTERLY VALUATION PROCESS YIELDS RESULTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY LOWER THAN RESIDUAL VALUE ESTIMATES BY INDEPENDENT SOURCES AND TENDS TO MORE

ACCURATELY REFLECT RESULTS UPON THE ACTUAL PLACEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT.

USED AIRCRAFT ACQUIRED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET AS IT IS OUR INTENT TO SELL THESE ASSETS. TO MITIGATE COSTS AND ENHANCE MARKETABILITY, AIRCRAFT MAY BE PLACED ON OPERATING

LEASE. WHILE ON OPERATING LEASE, THE ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER FINANCING, HOWEVER, THE VALUATION CONTINUES TO BE BASED ON THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET ASSESSMENT IS PERFORMED QUARTERLY USING THE PROCESS DESCRIBED

ABOVE.

ASSET VALUATION FOR ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASE, ASSETS HELD

FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE AND COLLATERAL UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES

CUSTOMER FINANCING INCLUDES OPERATING LEASE EQUIPMENT, NOTES RECEIVABLES, AND SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES. SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES ARE TREATED AS RECEIVABLES, AND ALLOWANCES FOR

LOSSES ARE ESTABLISHED AS NECESSARY.

WE ASSESS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

ASSETS WE OWN, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE, AND COLLATERAL UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES, TO DETERMINE IF THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE LESS

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THAN THE RELATED ASSETS CARRYING VALUES. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CARRYING VALUES AND FAIR VALUES OF FINANCE LEASES AND NOTES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, AS DETERMINED BY

COLLATERAL VALUE, ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES.

WE USE A MEDIAN CALCULATED FROM PUBLISHED COLLATERAL VALUES FROM MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY AIRCRAFT VALUE PUBLICATIONS BASED ON THE TYPE AND AGE OF THE AIRCRAFT TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF AIRCRAFT. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,

WE APPLY JUDGMENT BASED ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT, USUALLY WHEN THE FEATURES OR USE OF THE AIRCRAFT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE MORE GENERIC AIRCRAFT ATTRIBUTES COVERED BY OUTSIDE PUBLICATIONS.

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND HELD FOR SALE OR

RE-LEASE

WE EVALUATE ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW FROM THE ASSET IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. WE USE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS WHEN DETERMINING THE

EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW INCLUDING OUR INTENTIONS FOR HOW LONG WE WILL HOLD AN ASSET SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASE BEFORE IT IS SOLD, THE EXPECTED FUTURE LEASE RATES, LEASE TERMS, RESIDUAL VALUE OF THE ASSET, PERIODS IN WHICH THE ASSET MAY BE

HELD IN PREPARATION FOR A FOLLOW-ON LEASE, MAINTENANCE COSTS, REMARKETING COSTS AND THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSET. WE STATE ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING VALUE OR FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL.

WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT

EXPENSE RECORDED IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES

WE RECORD THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF RECEIVABLES IN OUR PORTFOLIO IN A VALUATION ACCOUNT, THE BALANCE OF WHICH IS AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE BUT UNCONFIRMED LOSSES IN

THE RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES RELATES TO TWO COMPONENTS OF RECEIVABLES: (A) SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AND (B) ALL OTHER RECEIVABLES.

WE DETERMINE A RECEIVABLE IS IMPAIRED WHEN, BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION AND EVENTS,

IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY SUBSEQUENT RESTRUCTURINGS. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING COLLECTIBILITY INCLUDE, BUT ARE

NOT LIMITED TO, A CUSTOMERS EXTENDED DELINQUENCY, REQUESTS FOR RESTRUCTURING AND FILINGS FOR BANKRUPTCY. WE DETERMINE A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL.

WE REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REMAINING RECEIVABLES (AFTER EXCLUDING RECEIVABLES SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCE) BY ASSESSING BOTH THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AND THE APPLICABLE CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATE. COLLATERAL EXPOSURE FOR A PARTICULAR RECEIVABLE

IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL. A RECEIVABLE WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE NO COLLATERAL EXPOSURE. THE APPLICABLE CUMULATIVE

DEFAULT RATE IS DETERMINED USING TWO COMPONENTS: CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACT TERM. CREDIT RATINGS ARE DETERMINED FOR EACH CUSTOMER IN THE PORTFOLIO. THOSE RATINGS ARE UPDATED BASED UPON PUBLIC INFORMATION AND

INFORMATION OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO

AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT WOULD ENTITLE US TO LOOK BEYOND THE SPECIFIC COLLATERAL UNDERLYING THE RECEIVABLE FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. SHOULD THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING

COLLATERAL ASSET RESULTING FROM A DEFAULT CONDITION BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR RECEIVABLE (CREATING A SHORTFALL CONDITION), THESE AGREEMENTS WOULD, FOR EXAMPLE, PERMIT US TO TAKE THE ACTIONS NECESSARY TO SELL OR RETAIN

CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS IN WHICH THE CUSTOMER HAS AN EQUITY INTEREST AND USE THE PROCEEDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL.

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EACH QUARTER WE REVIEW CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS, PUBLISHED HISTORICAL CREDIT DEFAULT RATES FOR DIFFERENT RATING

CATEGORIES, AND MULTIPLE THIRD PARTY AIRCRAFT VALUE PUBLICATIONS AS A BASIS TO VALIDATE THE REASONABLENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ACTUAL RESULTS WILL NOT DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES OR THAT THE

CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTORS IN THE FUTURE WILL NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES.

SUPPLIER PENALTIES

WE RECORD AN ACCRUAL FOR SUPPLIER PENALTIES WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS THAT MAKES IT PROBABLE THAT A SUPPLIER PENALTY WILL BE INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. UNTIL AN EVENT OCCURS, WE FULLY

ANTICIPATE ACCEPTING ALL PRODUCTS PROCURED UNDER PRODUCTION-RELATED CONTRACTS.

GUARANTEES

WE ACCOUNT FOR GUARANTEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 45,

GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS

. WE RECORD A LIABILITY FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF GUARANTEES IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND

OTHER LIABILITIES THAT ARE ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002. FOR A RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE WHERE WE RECEIVED A CASH PREMIUM, THE LIABILITY IS EQUAL TO THE CASH PREMIUM RECEIVED AT THE GUARANTEES INCEPTION. FOR CREDIT AND

PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES, THE LIABILITY IS EQUAL TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED LOSS. WE DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LOSS BY MULTIPLYING THE CREDITORS DEFAULT RATE BY THE GUARANTEE AMOUNT REDUCED BY THE EXPECTED RECOVERY, IF APPLICABLE, FOR

EACH FUTURE PERIOD THE CREDIT OR PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE WILL BE OUTSTANDING. IF AT INCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE, WE DETERMINE THERE IS A PROBABLE RELATED CONTINGENT LOSS, WE WILL RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY FOR THE GREATER OF (A) THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

GUARANTEE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE OR (B) THE PROBABLE CONTINGENT LOSS AMOUNT.

AS

REQUIRED UNDER SFAS 123R, DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES OF $79 AND $306 WERE RECLASSIFIED TO ADDITIONAL PAID IN CAPITAL IN 2007 AND 2006. THIS REPRESENTS THE TAX EFFECT OF THE NET EXCESS TAX POOL CREATED DURING 2007 AND 2006 DUE TO SHARE AWARDS PAID WITH

A FAIR MARKET VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE BOOK ACCRUAL FOR THOSE AWARDS.

INCLUDED IN THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006 ARE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE AMOUNTS OF $3,169 AND $5,240 RELATED TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NET INCOME TAX PAYMENTS/(REFUNDS) WERE $711, $28 AND ($344) IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX IN THE

AMOUNT OF $48 ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS NOT CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN OUR NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED FOR U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OR FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX ON THE REMAINDER OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FROM OUR NON-U.S.

SUBSIDIARIES BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED AND IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF TAX THAT MAY BE PAYABLE UPON DISTRIBUTION.

FASB INTERPRETATION NO. 48

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2007, WE ADOPTED FIN 48 WHICH PRESCRIBES A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THRESHOLD FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF A TAX

POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. THIS INTERPRETATION ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR

INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES IN INTERIM PERIODS AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. THE CUMULATIVE EFFECTS OF APPLYING THIS INTERPRETATION HAVE BEEN RECORDED AS A DECREASE OF $11 TO RETAINED EARNINGS, AN

INCREASE OF $125 TO DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND AN INCREASE OF $136 TO INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AS OF JANUARY 1, 2007.

IN CONJUNCTION WITH ADOPTION OF FIN 48, WE CLASSIFIED UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS AS NON-CURRENT INCOME TAX LIABILITIES UNLESS EXPECTED TO BE PAID IN ONE YEAR. WE ALSO

BEGAN REPORTING INCOME TAX-RELATED INTEREST INCOME IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF OPERATIONS. IN PRIOR PERIODS, SUCH INTEREST INCOME WAS REPORTED IN OTHER INCOME. WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, OTHER INCOME

INCLUDED INTEREST OF $16 IN 2006 AND $100 IN 2005 RELATED TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX SETTLEMENTS FOR PRIOR YEARS. PENALTIES AND TAX-RELATED INTEREST EXPENSE ARE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE. AS OF DECEMBER 31 AND JANUARY 1,

2007, THE AMOUNT OF ACCRUED INCOME TAX-RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION WAS AS FOLLOWS: INTEREST OF $143 AND $63, AND PENALTIES OF $17 AND $1. THE AMOUNTS OF INTEREST AND PENALTIES ACCRUED

DURING 2007 ARE $108 AND $17 RESPECTIVELY.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION

IN THE U.S. FEDERAL TAX JURISDICTION FOR THE 1998-2007 TAX YEARS. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION IN MAJOR STATE AND FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS FOR THE 2001-2007 TAX YEARS, FOR WHICH NO INDIVIDUALLY MATERIAL UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS EXIST. DURING THE

THIRD QUARTER OF 2007 WE RECEIVED AN INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) AUDIT REPORT FOR THE 2002-2003 TAX YEARS AND HAVE FILED AN APPEAL. WE HAVE ALSO FILED APPEALS WITH THE IRS FOR THE 1998-2001 TAX YEARS. WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATE PROVISIONS FOR ALL

OUTSTANDING ISSUES HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ALL JURISDICTIONS AND ALL OPEN YEARS.

A RECONCILIATION OF THE BEGINNING AND ENDING AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IS AS FOLLOWS.

CREDITS CLAIMED, U.S. TAXATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS, AND VALUATION ISSUES REGARDING CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS CLAIMED. ALSO INCLUDED IN THESE AMOUNTS ARE ACCRUALS FOR

DOMESTIC STATE TAX ISSUES SUCH AS THE ALLOCATION OF INCOME AMONG VARIOUS STATE TAX JURISDICTIONS AND THE AMOUNT OF STATE TAX CREDITS CLAIMED.

IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS WE AND THE IRS WILL RESOLVE SOME OF THE MATTERS PRESENTLY UNDER CONSIDERATION AT APPEALS FOR 1998-2003

WHICH MAY INCREASE OR DECREASE UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS FOR ALL OPEN TAX YEARS. SETTLEMENT COULD INCREASE EARNINGS IN AN AMOUNT RANGING FROM $0 TO $130 BASED ON CURRENT ESTIMATES. AUDIT OUTCOMES AND THE TIMING OF AUDIT SETTLEMENTS ARE

SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY.

THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT

EXPIRED ON DECEMBER 31, 2007. THE CREDIT PROVIDED A 2.4% AND A 0.7% REDUCTION IN THE 2007 AND 2006 EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. CONGRESS IS CURRENTLY CONSIDERING BILLS THAT WILL EXTEND THE CREDIT. IF THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDIT IS NOT

LEGISLATIVELY ENACTED THERE COULD BE AN UNFAVORABLE IMPACT ON OUR 2008 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE.

RECOVERABLE. AS A RESULT WE RECORDED CHARGES OF $31 FOR NON-RECOVERABLE DELTA II INVENTORY AND $39 FOR OUR SHARE OF THE LOSS RECORDED BY ULA RELATED TO DELTA II. FUTURE DECISIONS REGARDING THE DELTA II PROGRAM COULD REDUCE OUR EARNINGS BY UP TO $100

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON DECEMBER 1, 2006, WE ENTERED INTO A TRANSACTION WITH LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION (LOCKHEED) TO CREATE A

50/50 JOINT VENTURE NAMED UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE L.L.C. (ULA). ULA COMBINES THE PRODUCTION, ENGINEERING, TEST AND LAUNCH OPERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES OF BOEING DELTA AND LOCKHEED ATLAS ROCKETS. ULA CONDUCTED 13 AND ONE

SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006. WE AND LOCKHEED EACH HAVE AGREED TO PROVIDE ULA WITH INITIAL CASH CONTRIBUTIONS OF UP TO $25, AND WE EACH HAVE AGREED TO EXTEND A LINE OF CREDIT TO ULA OF UP TO $200 TO SUPPORT

ITS WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS. SEE NOTE 21.

ON JULY 24, 2007, WE

AND LOCKHEED REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO RESOLUTION OF THE FINAL WORKING CAPITAL AND THE VALUE OF THE LAUNCH VEHICLE SUPPORT CONTRACTS THAT EACH PARTY CONTRIBUTED TO FORM ULA. EFFECTIVE AUGUST 15, 2007, THE PARTIES RECEIVED ALL

NECESSARY APPROVALS PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE CONSENT ORDER WITH THE U.S. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION AND THE TERMS OF THE AGREEMENT, WHICH RESULTED IN ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS FROM BOTH PARTIES WITH BOEING AGREEING TO CONTRIBUTE AN ADDITIONAL $97.

OUR ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTION LIABILITY WILL BE OFFSET BY FUTURE PAYMENTS FROM ULA UNDER THE INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT.

THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE, IN WHICH WE ARE A 40% PARTNER WITH RSC ENERGIA OF RUSSIA (25%), AKER ASA OF NORWAY (20%), PO YUZHMASH (10%) AND SDO YUZHNOYE

(5%) OF THE UKRAINE, PROVIDES OCEAN-BASED LAUNCH SERVICES TO COMMERCIAL SATELLITE CUSTOMERS. THE VENTURE CONDUCTED ZERO, FIVE AND FOUR SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHES FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. A SEA LAUNCH

ZENIT-3SL VEHICLE, CARRYING A BOEING-BUILT NSS-8 SATELLITE, EXPERIENCED AN ANOMALY DURING LAUNCH ON JANUARY 30, 2007. THE LAUNCH PLATFORM HAS BEEN REPAIRED AND RESUMED FLIGHT OPERATIONS ON JANUARY 15, 2008, SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHING A

BOEING-BUILT SATELLITE. WE HAVE FINANCIAL EXPOSURE WITH RESPECT TO THE VENTURE, WHICH RELATES TO GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY US TO CERTAIN SEA LAUNCH CREDITORS, PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY US TO A SEA LAUNCH CUSTOMER, AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE

RELATED TO ADVANCES AND OTHER ASSETS REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE SUSPENDED RECORDING EQUITY LOSSES AFTER WRITING OUR INVESTMENT IN AND DIRECT LOANS TO SEA LAUNCH DOWN TO ZERO IN 2001 AND ACCRUING OUR OBLIGATION FOR THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES ON SEA LAUNCH INDEBTEDNESS. WE ARE NOT OBLIGATED TO

PROVIDE ANY FURTHER FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT THAT WE DO EXTEND ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO SEA LAUNCH IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL RECOGNIZE SUSPENDED LOSSES AS APPROPRIATE. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO LOOK AT

ALTERNATIVE CAPITAL STRUCTURES FOR THE VENTURE.

THE LIABILITIES RECORDED

REPRESENT OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF COSTS EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED TO REMEDIATE, OPERATE, AND MAINTAIN SITES OVER PERIODS OF UP TO 30 YEARS. ALTHOUGH NOT CONSIDERED PROBABLE, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL CHARGES BECAUSE OF

REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES, HIGHER THAN EXPECTED COSTS AND THE RISK OF UNIDENTIFIED CONTAMINATION. AS PART OF OUR ESTIMATING PROCESS, WE DEVELOP A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE ALTERNATE SCENARIOS WHICH INCLUDE HIGHEST COST ESTIMATES FOR ALL REMEDIATION

SITES BASED ON OUR EXPERIENCE AND EXISTING LAWS AND REGULATIONS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006 OUR REASONABLY POSSIBLE HIGHEST COST ESTIMATE FOR ALL REMEDIATION SITES EXCEEDED OUR RECORDED LIABILITIES BY $1,191 AND $939, EXCLUDING THE IMPACTS

OF ANY POTENTIAL RECOVERIES.

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

AS PART OF THE 2004 PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL

CORPORATION RELATED TO THE SALE OF BCCS COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS, BCC IS INVOLVED IN A LOSS SHARING ARRANGEMENT FOR LOSSES THAT MAY EXIST AT THE END OF THE INITIAL AND SUBSEQUENT FINANCING PERIODS OF TRANSFERRED PORTFOLIO ASSETS,

OR, IN SOME INSTANCES, PRIOR TO THE END OF THE FINANCING TERM, SUCH AS CERTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REPOSSESSION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, OUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOSS SHARING ARRANGEMENT WAS $224. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, THE ACCRUED LIABILITY UNDER THE LOSS SHARING ARRANGEMENT WAS $59 AND $78.

FUTURE LEASE COMMITMENTS

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, FUTURE LEASE COMMITMENTS ON AIRCRAFT AND OTHER COMMITMENTS NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION TOTALED $240 AND $323. THESE LEASE COMMITMENTS EXTEND THROUGH 2020, AND OUR INTENT IS TO

RECOVER THESE LEASE COMMITMENTS THROUGH SUBLEASE ARRANGEMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE FUTURE LEASE COMMITMENTS ON AIRCRAFT FOR EACH OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WERE AS FOLLOWS: $43 IN 2008, $20 IN 2009, $18 IN 2010, $19 IN 2011, AND $19 IN

2012. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDED $42 AND $65 ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADVERSE COMMITMENTS UNDER THESE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS.

THE ABOVE LIABILITY WAS DETERMINED BASED ON AVAILABLE INFORMATION AND WE MAKE REVISIONS TO OUR ESTIMATES ACCORDINGLY AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006 WE HAD $104,023 AND $86,254 OF PRODUCTION

RELATED PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION. SUCH OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE AGREEMENTS FOR PRODUCTION GOODS, TOOLING COSTS, ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS CONTRACTS, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, INVENTORY

PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS PRODUCTION RELATED OBLIGATIONS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE AMOUNTS OF PRODUCTION RELATED PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS FOR EACH OF THE NEXT FIVE YEARS WERE AS FOLLOWS: $37,922 IN 2008, $23,704 IN 2009,

$17,081 IN 2010, $10,976 IN 2011, AND $7,305 IN 2012.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT COMMITMENTS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNING A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF

NEW AIRCRAFT, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SPECIFIED-PRICE TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO TRADE IN THEIR USED AIRCRAFT FOR THE PURCHASE OF SALE AIRCRAFT. THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN VALUE WAS $924 AND $1,162 AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006. WE ANTICIPATE THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE COMMITMENTS WILL NOT BE EXERCISED BY CUSTOMERS. THERE WERE NO PROBABLE CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. THESE TRADE-IN COMMITMENT

AGREEMENTS HAVE EXPIRATION DATES FROM 2008 THROUGH 2015.

POTENTIAL C-17 SHUT-DOWN

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, WE DELIVERED 171 OF THE 190 C-17

AIRCRAFT ORDERED BY THE U.S. AIR FORCE, WITH FINAL DELIVERIES SCHEDULED FOR 2009. IN JUNE 2007, BASED UPON CONTINUED BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT, INCLUDING THE HOUSE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE ADDITION OF $2.4 BILLION FOR 10 C-17S IN THEIR MARK

OF THE 2008 BUDGET, AND U.S. AIR FORCE TESTIMONY TO CONGRESS REFLECTING INTEREST IN ADDITIONAL C-17 AIRCRAFT, WE DIRECTED KEY SUPPLIERS TO BEGIN WORK ON 10 AIRCRAFT BEYOND THE 190 CURRENTLY ON ORDER. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, INVENTORY

EXPENDITURES AND POTENTIAL TERMINATION LIABILITIES TO SUPPLIERS FOR

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WORK PERFORMED RELATED TO ANTICIPATED ORDERS FOR 10 C-17 AIRCRAFT TO THE U.S. AIR FORCE AND ANTICIPATED INTERNATIONAL ORDERS FOR 3 ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT TOTALED

APPROXIMATELY $215. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL DECIDE IN 2008 TO COMPLETE PRODUCTION OF THE C-17 IF FURTHER ORDERS ARE NOT RECEIVED. WE ARE STILL EVALUATING THE FULL FINANCIAL IMPACT OF A POTENTIAL PRODUCTION SHUT-DOWN, INCLUDING ANY

RECOVERY THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FROM THE GOVERNMENT. SUCH RECOVERY FROM THE GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT INCLUDE THE COSTS INCURRED BY US RESULTING FROM THE SECOND QUARTER DIRECTION TO KEY SUPPLIERS TO BEGIN WORKING ON THE ADDITIONAL 10 AIRCRAFT.

DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL AUDIT

WE HAVE BEEN ADVISED BY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE OFFICE OF THE INSPECTOR GENERAL (DOD

OIG) THAT IT IS CONDUCTING AN AUDIT OF THE APPLICATION OF ECONOMIC PRICE ADJUSTMENT (EPA) CLAUSES INCLUDED IN OUR MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS FOR THE C-17, F-18, AND APACHE PROGRAMS. A FINAL AUDIT REPORT HAS NOT BEEN ISSUED AND THE ACTIONS, IF ANY, THAT

OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS MAY TAKE IN RESPONSE TO THE AUDIT ARE UNKNOWN AT THIS TIME, AS IS ANY POTENTIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT IN THE FUTURE.

SATELLITES

THE BOEING-BUILT NSS-8 SATELLITE WAS DECLARED A TOTAL LOSS DUE TO AN ANOMALY DURING LAUNCH ON JANUARY 30, 2007. THE NSS-8 SATELLITE WAS INSURED FOR $200 WHICH WAS COLLECTED DURING THE SECOND AND THIRD QUARTER OF 2007. NEW

SKIES SATELLITES B.V. (NEW SKIES) DECLINED TO EXERCISE ITS OPTION TO PURCHASE A REPLACEMENT SPACECRAFT DUE TO ITS ASSERTION THAT WE ANTICIPATORILY BREACHED THE CONTRACT. WE BELIEVE THAT HAD NEW SKIES EXERCISED ITS OPTION, WE WOULD HAVE FULFILLED OUR

CONTRACTUAL RESPONSIBILITIES. WE DO NOT EXPECT NEW SKIES ASSERTION TO MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR CASH FLOWS.

IN CERTAIN LAUNCH AND SATELLITE SALES CONTRACTS, WE INCLUDE PROVISIONS THAT SPECIFY THAT WE BEAR RISK OF LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LAUNCH PHASE

THROUGH ACCEPTANCE IN ORBIT BY THE CUSTOMER. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY PURCHASED INSURANCE TO COVER THESE EXPOSURES WHEN ALLOWED UNDER THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT AND WHEN ECONOMICALLY ADVISABLE. THE CURRENT INSURANCE MARKET REFLECTS HIGH PREMIUM RATES AND

ALSO SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF CAPACITY TO HANDLE ALL INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. WE MAKE DECISIONS ON THE PROCUREMENT OF INSURANCE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF RISK. THERE IS ONE CONTRACTUAL LAUNCH SCHEDULED IN 2008 FOR WHICH FULL INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT

BE AVAILABLE OR, IF AVAILABLE, COULD BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW THIS RISK. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE POTENTIAL UNINSURED AMOUNT FOR THIS LAUNCH COULD APPROACH $350 DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE UNINSURED EVENT.

FINANCING COMMITMENTS

FINANCING COMMITMENTS TOTALED $8,350 AND $10,164 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006. WE ANTICIPATE THAT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

THESE COMMITMENTS WILL NOT BE EXERCISED BY THE CUSTOMERS AS WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THIRD PARTY FINANCIERS TO PROVIDE ALTERNATIVE FINANCING TO CUSTOMERS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FORMATION OF ULA, WE AND LOCKHEED EACH COMMITTED TO PROVIDE UP TO $25 IN ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS AND WE EACH HAVE AGREED TO EXTEND A

LINE OF CREDIT TO ULA OF UP TO $200 TO SUPPORT ITS WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS DURING THE FIVE YEAR PERIOD FOLLOWING DECEMBER 1, 2006. ULA DID NOT REQUEST ANY FUNDS UNDER THE LINE OF CREDIT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND SURETY BONDS WITH

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRIMARILY RELATING TO THE GUARANTEE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE ON CERTAIN CONTRACTS. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ON OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND SURETY BONDS AGGREGATED APPROXIMATELY $4,973 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007

AND APPROXIMATELY $4,368 AT DECEMBER 31, 2006.

COMPANY OWNED LIFE INSURANCE

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION INSURED ITS EXECUTIVES WITH COMPANY OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (COLI), WHICH ARE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES WITH A CASH SURRENDER VALUE.

ALTHOUGH WE DO NOT USE COLI CURRENTLY, THESE OBLIGATIONS FROM THE MERGER WITH MCDONNELL DOUGLAS ARE STILL A COMMITMENT AT THIS TIME. WE HAVE LOANS IN PLACE TO COVER COSTS PAID OR INCURRED TO CARRY THE UNDERLYING LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE WAS $310 AND $288 AND THE TOTAL LOANS WERE $298 AND $279. AS WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO OFFSET THE LOANS AGAINST THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE OF THE POLICIES, WE PRESENT THE NET ASSET IN OTHER ASSETS

ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006.

NOTE 14  DEBT

TOTAL DEBT INTEREST INCURRED,

INCLUDING AMOUNTS CAPITALIZED, WAS $591, $657, AND $713 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. INTEREST EXPENSE RECORDED BY BCC IS REFLECTED AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, AND

IS INCLUDED IN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS. TOTAL COMPANY INTEREST PAYMENTS WERE $616, $657, AND $671 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

WE HAVE $3,000 CURRENTLY AVAILABLE UNDER CREDIT LINE AGREEMENTS. WE HAVE GIVEN BCC EXCLUSIVE ACCESS TO $1,500 UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS. WE CONTINUE

TO BE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH ALL COVENANTS CONTAINED IN OUR DEBT OR CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENTS, INCLUDING THOSE AT BCC.

ON MARCH 23, 2004, WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION WITH THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) FOR $1,000 FOR THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES AND

UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK. THE ENTIRE AMOUNT REMAINS AVAILABLE FOR POTENTIAL DEBT ISSUANCE. BCC HAS $3,421 THAT REMAINS AVAILABLE FROM SHELF REGISTRATIONS FILED WITH THE SEC. BOTH OF BCCS SHELF REGISTRATIONS EXPIRE IN NOVEMBER 2008. THE

AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING UNDER THESE SHELF REGISTRATIONS IS DEPENDENT ON INVESTOR DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

ON JUNE 6, 2002, BCC ESTABLISHED A EURO MEDIUM-TERM NOTE PROGRAM IN THE AMOUNT OF $1,500. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, BCC HAD ZERO DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE PROGRAM SUCH THAT $1,500 WOULD

NORMALLY BE AVAILABLE FOR POTENTIAL DEBT ISSUANCE. HOWEVER, DEBT ISSUANCE UNDER THIS PROGRAM REQUIRES THAT DOCUMENTATION, INFORMATION, AND OTHER PROCEDURES RELATING TO BCC AND THE PROGRAM BE UPDATED WITHIN THE PRIOR TWELVE MONTHS. IN VIEW OF

BCCS CASH POSITION AND OTHER AVAILABLE FUNDING SOURCES, BCC DETERMINED DURING 2004 THAT IT WAS UNLIKELY THEY WOULD NEED TO USE THIS PROGRAM IN THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE PROGRAM IS THUS INACTIVE BUT AVAILABLE SUBJECT TO UPDATED DOCUMENTATION

AND PROCEDURES. THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING UNDER THIS PROGRAM WOULD BE DEPENDENT ON INVESTOR DEMAND AND MARKET CONDITIONS.

NOTE 15  POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

WE HAVE VARIOUS PENSION PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES.

WE FUND ALL OUR MAJOR PENSION PLANS THROUGH TRUSTS. PENSION ASSETS ARE PLACED IN TRUST SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PLANS PARTICIPANTS, AND ARE STRUCTURED TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO PAY BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS TO KEEP

PACE OVER THE LONG TERM WITH THE GROWTH OF OBLIGATIONS FOR FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

84

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ALSO HAVE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS WHICH CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR

ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, LIFE INSURANCE TO CERTAIN GROUPS OF RETIREES. RETIREE HEALTH CARE IS PROVIDED PRINCIPALLY UNTIL AGE 65 FOR APPROXIMATELY HALF THOSE RETIREES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HEALTH CARE

COVERAGE. CERTAIN EMPLOYEE GROUPS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES COVERED BY MOST UNITED AUTO WORKERS BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, ARE PROVIDED LIFETIME HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. WE USE A MEASUREMENT DATE OF SEPTEMBER 30 FOR OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT (OPB) PLANS.

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2006, WE ADOPTED SFAS

NO. 158, WHICH REQUIRES THAT THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION REFLECT THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PLAN ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE

AND THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION (PBO). WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE AGGREGATE OF ALL OVERFUNDED PLANS IN PENSION PLAN ASSETS, NET AND THE AGGREGATE OF ALL UNDERFUNDED PLANS IN EITHER ACCRUED RETIREE HEALTH CARE OR ACCRUED PENSION PLAN LIABILITY, NET.

THE PORTION OF THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE ACTUARIAL PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFITS INCLUDED IN THE PBO EXCEEDS THE FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS, PAYABLE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, IS REFLECTED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES.

EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2008, SFAS NO. 158 WILL REQUIRE US TO MEASURE PLAN

ASSETS AND BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AT FISCAL YEAR END. WE CURRENTLY PERFORM THIS MEASUREMENT AT SEPTEMBER 30 OF EACH YEAR. BEGINNING IN FOURTH QUARTER OF 2007 IN ACCORDANCE WITH THIS STANDARD, WE ELIMINATED THE USE OF A THREE-MONTH LAG PERIOD WHEN

RECOGNIZING THE IMPACT OF CURTAILMENTS OR SETTLEMENTS AND, INSTEAD, RECOGNIZE THESE AMOUNTS IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY OCCUR. THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 158 DO NOT PERMIT RETROSPECTIVE APPLICATION.

IN 2005, WE MODIFIED OUR METHOD

OF DETERMINING THE DISCOUNT RATE SO THAT THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR EACH INDIVIDUAL PENSION PLAN IS DETERMINED SEPARATELY BASED ON THE DURATION OF EACH PLANS LIABILITIES. PREVIOUSLY, WE DETERMINED A SINGLE DISCOUNT RATE FOR ALL OUR POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT PLANS. WE MADE THE CHANGE MAINLY BECAUSE OF THE DIVERGENCE IN THE POPULATIONS OF OUR VARIOUS PLANS DUE TO EMPLOYEE TRANSFERS, LAYOFFS AND DIVESTITURES. THE NEW METHOD CONTINUES TO INCLUDE A MATCHING OF THE PLANS EXPECTED FUTURE BENEFIT

PAYMENTS AGAINST A YIELD CURVE THATS BASED ON HIGH QUALITY, NON-CALLABLE BONDS IN THE BLOOMBERG INDEX AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE, OMITTING BONDS WITH THE TEN PERCENT HIGHEST AND THE TEN PERCENT LOWEST YIELDS. THE DISCLOSED RATE IS THE AVERAGE

RATE FOR ALL THE PLANS, WEIGHTED BY THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2007, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE WAS 6.20%, AND THE

87

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RATES FOR INDIVIDUAL PLANS RANGED FROM 5.30% TO 6.40%. AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2006, THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE WAS 5.90%, AND THE RATES FOR INDIVIDUAL PLANS RANGED FROM

5.00% TO 6.00%.

THE PENSION FUNDS EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS

ASSUMPTION IS DERIVED FROM AN EXTENSIVE STUDY CONDUCTED BY OUR TRUST INVESTMENTS GROUP AND ITS ACTUARIES ON A PERIODIC BASIS. THE STUDY INCLUDES A REVIEW OF ACTUAL HISTORICAL RETURNS ACHIEVED BY THE PENSION TRUST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE LONG-TERM

PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL ASSET CLASSES WITH CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO THE RELATED INVESTMENT STRATEGY. WHILE THE STUDY GIVES APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATION TO RECENT TRUST PERFORMANCE AND HISTORICAL RETURNS, THE ASSUMPTION REPRESENTS A LONG-TERM

PROSPECTIVE RETURN. THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS DETERMINED ON EACH MEASUREMENT DATE IS USED TO CALCULATE THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST/(INCOME) FOR THE UPCOMING PLAN YEAR.

RATES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR THE HEALTH CARE PLANS. TO DETERMINE THE HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES WE LOOK AT A COMBINATION OF INFORMATION INCLUDING ONGOING CLAIMS COST MONITORING, ANNUAL STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF CLAIMS

DATA, RECONCILIATION OF FORECAST CLAIMS AGAINST ACTUAL CLAIMS, REVIEW OF TREND ASSUMPTIONS OF OTHER PLAN SPONSORS AND NATIONAL HEALTH TRENDS, AND ADJUSTMENTS FOR PLAN DESIGN CHANGES, WORKFORCE CHANGES, AND CHANGES IN PLAN PARTICIPANT BEHAVIOR. A

ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT CHANGE IN ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECT.

PLAN ASSETS

PENSION ASSETS TOTALED $50,439 AND $46,203 AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AND 2006. IN

LATE 2006, THE COMPANY DECIDED TO MODIFY THE PENSION ASSET STRATEGY WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF REDUCING VOLATILITY RELATIVE TO PENSION LIABILITIES, ACHIEVING A COMPETITIVE INVESTMENT RETURN, ACHIEVING DIVERSIFICATION BETWEEN AND WITHIN VARIOUS ASSET

CLASSES, AND MANAGING OTHER RISKS. IN ORDER TO REDUCE THE VOLATILITY BETWEEN THE VALUE OF PENSION ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE COMPANY INCREASED ITS ALLOCATION TO FIXED INCOME AS WELL AS LENGTHENED THE DURATION OF ITS FIXED INCOME HOLDINGS. THE

ALLOCATION TO ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENTS, PRIVATE EQUITY, REAL ESTATE, REAL ASSETS, HEDGE FUNDS, AND GLOBAL STRATEGIES, WAS ALSO INCREASED IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE RETURN AND DIVERSIFICATION OBJECTIVES. KEY RISK MANAGEMENT AREAS ADDRESSED THROUGH THIS

MODIFIED STRATEGY INCLUDE FUNDED STATUS RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, MARKET RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, AND LIQUIDITY.

ACTUAL INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS VARY FROM TARGET ALLOCATIONS DUE TO PERIODIC INVESTMENT STRATEGY CHANGES AND THE LENGTH OF TIME IT TAKES TO COMPLETE INVESTMENTS IN ASSET CLASSES SUCH AS PRIVATE EQUITY, REAL

ESTATE, REAL ASSETS, AND OTHER INVESTMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, ACTUAL AND TARGET ALLOCATIONS VARY DUE TO THE TIMING OF BENEFIT PAYMENTS OR CONTRIBUTIONS MADE ON OR NEAR THE MEASUREMENT DATE.

PENSION INVESTMENT MANAGERS ARE RETAINED WITH A SPECIFIC INVESTMENT ROLE AND CORRESPONDING INVESTMENT GUIDELINES. INVESTMENT MANAGERS

HAVE THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE SECURITIES ON BEHALF OF THE PENSION FUND AND INVEST IN DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS EQUITY OR BOND FUTURES, SWAPS, OPTIONS, OR CURRENCY

FORWARDS. DERIVATIVES GENERALLY ARE USED TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED MARKET EXPOSURE OF A SECURITY OR AN INDEX, TRANSFER VALUE-ADDED PERFORMANCE BETWEEN ASSET CLASSES,

ACHIEVE THE DESIRED CURRENCY EXPOSURE, ADJUST PORTFOLIO DURATION, OR REBALANCE THE TOTAL PORTFOLIO TO THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION.

THE ACTUAL ALLOCATIONS FOR THE PENSION ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AND 2006, AND TARGET ALLOCATIONS BY ASSET CATEGORY, ARE AS FOLLOWS.

EQUITY INCLUDES DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES, SUCH AS COMMON, PREFERRED OR OTHER CAPITAL STOCK, AS WELL AS EQUITY FUTURES, CURRENCY FORWARDS AND RESIDUAL CASH ALLOCATED TO THE EQUITY MANAGERS. EQUITY INCLUDES OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE AMOUNTS OF $0 (0% OF PLAN

ASSETS) AND $1,260 (2.8% OF PLAN ASSETS) AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AND 2006. A CURRENCY MANAGEMENT STRATEGY WAS IMPLEMENTED DURING 2006 WHICH USES CURRENCY FORWARDS AND OPTIONS. EQUITY AND CURRENCY MANAGEMENT DERIVATIVES BASED ON NET NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS TOTALED 1.9% AND 6.6% OF PLAN ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AND 2006.

DEBT INCLUDES DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL DEBT SECURITIES, SUCH AS U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES, CORPORATE BONDS; CASH EQUIVALENTS; AND INVESTMENTS IN BOND DERIVATIVES SUCH AS BOND FUTURES, OPTIONS, SWAPS AND

CURRENCY FORWARDS. BOND DERIVATIVES BASED ON NET NOTIONAL AMOUNTS TOTALED 16.6% AND 7.0% OF PLAN ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AND 2006. ADDITIONALLY, DEBT INCLUDES TO-BE-ANNOUNCED MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES (TBA) AND TREASURY

FORWARDS WHICH HAVE DELAYED, FUTURE SETTLEMENT DATES. DEBT INCLUDED $2,478 AND $1,770 RELATED TO TBA SECURITIES AND TREASURY FORWARDS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AND 2006.

PRIVATE EQUITY REPRESENTS PRIVATE MARKET INVESTMENTS WHICH ARE GENERALLY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS. REAL ESTATE INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE AND PUBLIC

REAL ESTATE. REAL ASSETS INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN NATURAL RESOURCES (SUCH AS ENERGY AND TIMBER) AND INFRASTRUCTURE. HEDGE FUNDS INCLUDE EVENT DRIVEN, RELATIVE VALUE, LONG-SHORT AND MARKET NEUTRAL STRATEGIES. GLOBAL STRATEGIES SEEK TO IDENTIFY

INEFFICIENCIES ACROSS VARIOUS ASSET CLASSES AND MARKETS, USING LONG-SHORT POSITIONS IN PHYSICAL SECURITIES AND DERIVATIVES.

WE HELD $96 AND $89 IN TRUST FUND ASSETS FOR OPB PLANS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2007 AND 2006. MOST OF THESE FUNDS ARE INVESTED IN A BALANCED INDEX FUND WHICH IS

COMPRISED OF APPROXIMATELY 60% EQUITIES AND 40% DEBT SECURITIES. THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON THESE ASSETS DOES NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST.

TERMINATION PROVISIONS

CERTAIN OF THE PENSION PLANS PROVIDE THAT, IN THE EVENT THERE IS A CHANGE IN CONTROL

OF THE COMPANY WHICH IS NOT APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE PLANS ARE TERMINATED WITHIN FIVE YEARS THEREAFTER, THE ASSETS IN THE PLAN FIRST WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS REQUIRED BY ERISA, AND THEN ANY SURPLUS

WILL BE USED TO FUND A TRUST TO CONTINUE PRESENT AND FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS IN OUR GROUP INSURANCE BENEFIT PROGRAMS.

WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN PENSION PLANS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, SHOULD WE TERMINATE ANY OF THE PLANS UNDER

CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE PLANS ASSETS EXCEED THAT PLANS OBLIGATIONS, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL BE ENTITLED TO A FAIR ALLOCATION OF ANY OF THE PLANS ASSETS BASED ON PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE REIMBURSED UNDER U.S. GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS.

401(K) PLANS

WE PROVIDE CERTAIN DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS TO ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. THE PRINCIPAL

PLANS ARE THE COMPANY-SPONSORED 401(K) PLANS. THE EXPENSE FOR THESE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS WAS $536, $514 AND $483 IN 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 16  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

ON MAY 1, 2006, THE SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED AN AMENDMENT TO THE BOEING COMPANY 2003 INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN (2003 PLAN). THE 2003 PLAN PERMITS AWARDS OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS,

RESTRICTED STOCK, STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE SHARES, PERFORMANCE UNITS AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, CONSULTANTS AND INDEPENDENT CONTRACTORS. THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR STOCK AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE AMENDED 2003

PLAN WILL NOT EXCEED 60,000,000. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE AMENDED 2003 PLAN, NO MORE THAN AN AGGREGATE OF 12,000,000 SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR 1997 INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN (1997 PLAN) PERMITS THE GRANT OF STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS) AND

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS (DENOMINATED IN STOCK OR STOCK UNITS) TO EMPLOYEES AND CONTRACT EMPLOYEES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PLAN, 64,000,000 SHARES ARE AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UPON EXERCISE OF OPTIONS, AS PAYMENT OF SARS AND AS RESTRICTED STOCK

AWARDS, OF WHICH NO MORE THAN AN AGGREGATE OF 6,000,000 SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS. THIS AUTHORIZATION FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 1997 PLAN TERMINATED ON APRIL 30, 2007.

SHARES ISSUED AS A RESULT OF STOCK OPTION EXERCISE OR CONVERSION OF STOCK UNIT AWARDS

WILL BE FUNDED OUT OF TREASURY SHARES EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE INSUFFICIENT TREASURY SHARES IN WHICH CASE NEW SHARES WILL BE ISSUED. WE BELIEVE WE CURRENTLY HAVE ADEQUATE TREASURY SHARES TO MEET ANY REQUIREMENTS TO ISSUE SHARES DURING 2008.

SHARE-BASED PLANS EXPENSE IS PRIMARILY INCLUDED IN GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE SINCE IT IS INCENTIVE COMPENSATION ISSUED PRIMARILY TO OUR EXECUTIVES. THE SHARE-BASED PLANS EXPENSE AND RELATED INCOME TAX BENEFIT FOLLOW.

ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R

WE EARLY ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123R AS OF

JANUARY 1, 2005 USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE METHOD. UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R, WE RECORDED AN INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS OF $21, NET OF TAXES OF $12, AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE DUE TO SFAS NO. 123RS

REQUIREMENT TO APPLY AN ESTIMATED FORFEITURE RATE TO UNVESTED AWARDS. PREVIOUSLY WE EXPENSED FORFEITURES AS INCURRED. SFAS NO. 123R ALSO RESULTED IN CHANGES IN OUR METHODS OF MEASURING AND AMORTIZING COMPENSATION COST OF OUR PERFORMANCE SHARES.

FOR PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED PRIOR TO 2005, SHARE-BASED EXPENSE WAS

MEASURED BASED ON THE MARKET PRICE OF OUR STOCK ON THE AWARD DATE AND WAS GENERALLY AMORTIZED OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD. FOR PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED IN 2005, THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD WAS MEASURED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING A MONTE CARLO

SIMULATION MODEL. THE MONTE CARLO MODEL ALSO COMPUTED AN EXPECTED TERM FOR EACH PERFORMANCE SHARE. WE CHANGED OUR VALUATION METHOD BASED ON FURTHER CLARIFICATION PROVIDED IN SFAS NO. 123R AND THE FACT THAT OUR PERFORMANCE SHARES CONTAIN A

MARKET CONDITION, WHICH SHOULD BE REFLECTED IN THE GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF AN AWARD. THE MONTE CARLO SIMULATION MODEL UTILIZES MULTIPLE INPUT VARIABLES THAT DETERMINE THE PROBABILITY OF SATISFYING EACH MARKET CONDITION STIPULATED IN THE AWARD

GRANT.

ADDITIONALLY, PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 123R, WE

AMORTIZED COMPENSATION COST FOR SHARE-BASED AWARDS OVER THE STATED VESTING PERIOD FOR RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES AND, IF AN EMPLOYEE RETIRED BEFORE THE END OF THE VESTING PERIOD, WE RECOGNIZED ANY REMAINING UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST AT THE

DATE OF RETIREMENT. AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 123R, FOR ALL SHARE-BASED AWARDS GRANTED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2005, WE RECOGNIZE COMPENSATION COST FOR RETIREMENT ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES OVER THE GREATER OF ONE YEAR FROM THE DATE OF GRANT OR

THE PERIOD FROM THE DATE OF GRANT TO THE EMPLOYEES RETIREMENT ELIGIBILITY DATE (NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING APPROACH). HAD WE ALSO APPLIED THE NON-SUBSTANTIVE VESTING APPROACH TO AWARDS GRANTED PRIOR TO 2005, COMPENSATION EXPENSE WOULD HAVE BEEN

$6, $50 AND $96 LOWER FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005.

INTEREST RATE REFLECTS THE YIELD ON THE ZERO COUPON U.S. TREASURY BASED ON THE PERFORMANCE SHARES REMAINING CONTRACTUAL TERM. STOCK BETA IS A MEASURE OF HOW OUR STOCK PRICE MOVES RELATIVE TO THE STOCK MARKET AS A WHOLE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE

2005 PERFORMANCE SHARES IS AMORTIZED OVER THE EXPECTED TERM OF EACH AWARD. THE EXPECTED TERM OF 1 TO 4 YEARS FOR EACH AWARD GRANTED IS DERIVED FROM THE OUTPUT OF THE VALUATION MODEL AND REPRESENTS THE MEDIAN TIME REQUIRED TO SATISFY THE CONDITIONS

OF THE AWARD, ADJUSTED FOR THE EFFECT OF RETIREE ELIGIBLE PARTICIPANTS. EACH PRICE GROWTH TARGET HAS A DIFFERENT EXPECTED TERM, RESULTING IN THE RANGE OF VALUES PROVIDED.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THERE WAS $22 OF UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO THE PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED

OVER A WEIGHTED AVERAGE PERIOD OF 0.1 YEARS. IN CONNECTION WITH PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT HAVE NOT MET THE MARKET CONDITIONS, WE RECLASSIFIED $288 FROM ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL TO OTHER LIABILITIES AND RECOGNIZED A CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENT TO GENERAL

AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE OF $88 DURING 2005. ADDITIONALLY, EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2005, WE MODIFIED OUR DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION PLAN TO REQUIRE ALL PERFORMANCE SHARES THAT WERE UNVESTED AND DEFERRED AS STOCK UNITS TO BE SETTLED IN STOCK.

OPTIONS HAVE BEEN GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF OUR STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT. FOR

STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED PRIOR TO 2006, VESTING IS GENERALLY OVER A FIVE-YEAR SERVICE PERIOD WITH PORTIONS OF A GRANT BECOMING EXERCISABLE AT ONE YEAR, THREE YEARS AND FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF GRANT. IN THE EVENT AN EMPLOYEE HAS A TERMINATION OF

EMPLOYMENT DUE TO RETIREMENT, LAYOFF, DISABILITY OR DEATH, THE EMPLOYEE (OR BENEFICIARY) IMMEDIATELY VESTS IN GRANTS THAT HAVE BEEN OUTSTANDING FOR AT LEAST ONE YEAR.

ON FEBRUARY 26, 2007 AND FEBRUARY 27, 2006, WE GRANTED TO OUR EXECUTIVES 5,334,700 AND 6,361,100 OPTIONS WITH AN EXERCISE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR THE STOCK OPTION GRANTS ISSUED IN 2007 AND 2006, THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY IS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF OUR

HISTORICAL STOCK VOLATILITY AND THE VOLATILITY LEVELS IMPLIED ON THE GRANT DATE BY ACTIVELY TRADED OPTION CONTRACTS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. WE DETERMINED THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE 2007 AND 2006 STOCK OPTION GRANTS TO BE 6 YEARS, CALCULATED USING THE

SIMPLIFIED METHOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SEC STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN 107,

VALUATION OF SHARE-BASED PAYMENT ARRANGEMENTS FOR PUBLIC COMPANIES

. WE USED THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD SINCE WE CHANGED THE VESTING TERMS, TAX

TREATMENT AND THE RECIPIENTS OF OUR STOCK OPTIONS BEGINNING IN 2006 SUCH THAT WE BELIEVE OUR HISTORICAL DATA NO LONGER PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS UPON WHICH TO ESTIMATE EXPECTED TERM.

OTHER STOCK UNIT AWARDS

THE TOTAL NUMBER OF OTHER STOCK UNIT AWARDS THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE EITHER TO COMMON STOCK OR CASH EQUIVALENTS AND ARE NOT CONTINGENT UPON STOCK PRICE WERE 1,997,763,

1,871,559 AND 2,037,438 AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

LIABILITY AWARD PAYMENTS RELATING TO BOEING STOCK UNITS TOTALED $40, $57 AND $32 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY.

SHAREVALUE TRUST

THE SHAREVALUE TRUST, ESTABLISHED EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 1996, IS A 14-YEAR IRREVOCABLE TRUST THAT HOLDS OUR COMMON STOCK, RECEIVES DIVIDENDS, AND DISTRIBUTES TO

EMPLOYEES THE APPRECIATION IN VALUE ABOVE A 3% PER ANNUM THRESHOLD RATE OF RETURN AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD. THE TOTAL COMPENSATION EXPENSE TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRUST WAS DETERMINED USING A BINOMIAL OPTION-PRICING MODEL AND WAS

NOT AFFECTED BY ADOPTION OF SFAS NO.123R.

THE TRUST WAS SPLIT BETWEEN

TWO FUNDS, FUND 1 AND FUND 2, UPON ITS INITIAL FUNDING. EACH FUND CONSISTS OF INVESTMENT PERIODS WHICH RESULT IN OVERLAPPING PERIODS AS FOLLOWS.

PERIOD 1 (FUND 1).

JULY 1, 1996 TO JUNE 30, 1998

PERIOD 2 (FUND 2).

JULY 1, 1996 TO JUNE 30, 2000

PERIOD 6 (FUND 2).

JULY 1, 2004 TO JUNE 30, 2008

PERIOD 7 (FUND 1).

JULY 1, 2006 TO JUNE 30, 2010

AN INITIAL INVESTMENT VALUE IS

ESTABLISHED FOR EACH INVESTMENT PERIOD BASED ON THE LESSER OF EITHER (1) FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE FUND OR (2) THE PRIOR ENDING BALANCE OF THAT FUND. THIS AMOUNT IS THEN COMPOUNDED BY THE 3% PER ANNUM TO DETERMINE THE THRESHOLD AMOUNT

THAT MUST BE MET FOR THAT INVESTMENT PERIOD. AT THE END OF THE INVESTMENT PERIOD, THE VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT IN EXCESS OF THE THRESHOLD AMOUNT WILL RESULT IN A DISTRIBUTION TO PARTICIPANTS. A DISTRIBUTION IS PROPORTIONALLY DISTRIBUTED IN THE RATIO

EACH PARTICIPANTS NUMBER OF MONTHS OF PARTICIPATION WHICH RELATES TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF MONTHS EARNED BY ALL PARTICIPANTS IN THE INVESTMENT PERIOD. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THE TRUST HELD 31,362,850 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE TWO

FUNDS.

BASED ON THE AVERAGE STOCK PRICE OF $82.285 AS OF JUNE 30,

2006, THE MARKET VALUE OF FUND 1 EXCEEDED THE THRESHOLD OF $1,004 BY $758. THIS EXCESS WAS PAID IN BOEING COMMON STOCK, EXCEPT FOR PARTIAL SHARES AND DISTRIBUTIONS TO NON-U.S. EMPLOYEES AND BENEFICIARIES OF DECEASED PARTICIPANTS, WHICH WERE PAID IN

CASH. AFTER EMPLOYEE WITHHOLDING TAXES OF $265, WHICH WERE RECORDED AS A LIABILITY IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006 AND WERE PAID IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006, 5.6 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK WERE DISTRIBUTED TO PARTICIPANTS DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2006. THESE DISTRIBUTIONS WERE RECORDED AS A DEDUCTION TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL. IN ADDITION,

RELATED EMPLOYER PAYROLL TAXES OF $59 WERE EXPENSED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2006.

IF ON JUNE 30, 2008, THE MARKET VALUE OF FUND 2 EXCEEDS $1,028, THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE THRESHOLD WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO EMPLOYEES IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. SIMILARLY, IF ON JUNE 30, 2010, THE MARKET VALUE OF

FUND 1 EXCEEDS $1,130, THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE THRESHOLD WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO EMPLOYEES IN SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 THE MARKET VALUES OF FUND 1 AND 2 WERE $1,094 AND $1,658.

THE SHAREVALUE TRUST IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CONTRA-EQUITY ACCOUNT AND STATED AT MARKET

VALUE. MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ARE OFFSET TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL. AT DECEMBER 31, 2007, THERE WAS $180 OF TOTAL UNRECOGNIZED COMPENSATION COST RELATED TO THE SHAREVALUE TRUST WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE RECOGNIZED OVER A PERIOD OF 2.5

YEARS.

DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY HAS A DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN WHICH PERMITS EXECUTIVES TO DEFER RECEIPT

OF A PORTION OF THEIR SALARY, BONUS, AND CERTAIN OTHER INCENTIVE AWARDS. PRIOR TO MAY 1, 2006, EMPLOYEES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN COULD CHOOSE TO DEFER IN EITHER AN INTEREST EARNING ACCOUNT OR A BOEING STOCK UNIT

ACCOUNT. EFFECTIVE MAY 1, 2006, PARTICIPANTS CAN DIVERSIFY DEFERRED COMPENSATION AMONG 19 INVESTMENT FUNDS INCLUDING THE INTEREST EARNING ACCOUNT AND THE BOEING STOCK UNIT ACCOUNT.

TOTAL EXPENSE RELATED TO DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION WAS $51, $210 AND $149 IN 2007, 2006, AND 2005, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, FOR

EMPLOYEES WHO ELECTED TO DEFER THEIR COMPENSATION IN STOCK UNITS PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY MATCHED 25% OF THE DEFERRAL WITH ADDITIONAL STOCK UNITS. UPON RETIREMENT, THE 25% MATCH IS SETTLED IN CASH OR STOCK; HOWEVER, EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2006 ALL MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS ARE SETTLED IN STOCK. THIS MODIFICATION RESULTED IN NO INCREMENTAL COMPENSATION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITY WHICH IS BEING MARKED TO MARKET WAS $1,415

NOTE 18  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

CASH FLOW HEDGES

OUR CASH FLOW HEDGES INCLUDE CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CROSS CURRENCY SWAPS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, FOREIGN CURRENCY OPTION CONTRACTS AND COMMODITY

PURCHASE CONTRACTS. INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS UNDER WHICH WE AGREE TO PAY FIXED RATES OF INTEREST ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF VARIABLE-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS. WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MANAGE CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED

WITH CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFICALLY SALES AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS MADE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HEDGE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS PRINCIPALLY OCCURRING WITHIN FIVE YEARS IN THE FUTURE, WITH CERTAIN

CONTRACTS HEDGING TRANSACTIONS UP TO 2021. WE USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS FIXED-PRICE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, TO HEDGE AGAINST POTENTIALLY UNFAVORABLE PRICE CHANGES FOR ITEMS USED IN PRODUCTION. THESE INCLUDE COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE ELECTRICITY

AT FIXED PRICES THROUGH 2011.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2007, 2006, AND 2005, GAINS OF $24, $24, AND $3, RESPECTIVELY, (NET OF TAX) WERE RECLASSIFIED TO COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS. IN 2006, ADDITIONAL GAINS OF $12 WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE LOSS TO OTHER INCOME, NET, AS A RESULT OF DISCONTINUANCE OF CASH FLOW HEDGE DESIGNATION BASED ON THE PROBABILITY THAT THE ORIGINAL FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS WILL NOT OCCUR BY THE END OF THE ORIGINALLY SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD. SUCH

RECLASSIFICATIONS WERE NOT SIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2005. INEFFECTIVENESS FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES WAS INSIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2007 AND 2006, NET GAINS OF $92 AND $18 (NET OF TAX) WERE RECORDED

IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS. BASED ON OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO OF CASH FLOW HEDGES, WE EXPECT TO RECLASSIFY TO COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES A GAIN OF $64 (NET OF TAX) DURING 2008.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

INTEREST RATE SWAPS UNDER WHICH WE AGREE TO PAY VARIABLE RATES OF INTEREST ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE DEBT. THE

NET CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES AND THE HEDGED ITEMS IS REPORTED IN INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE. INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS INSIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005, $5, $8, AND $12 OF GAINS

RELATED TO THE BASIS ADJUSTMENT OF CERTAIN TERMINATED INTEREST RATE SWAPS WERE AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECEIVING HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT

WE ALSO HOLD CERTAIN NON-HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS INTEREST EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WARRANTS, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE

RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME, NET. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007, 2006 AND 2005, THESE NON-HEDGING INSTRUMENTS RESULTED IN NET (LOSSES)/GAIN OF ($47), ($6), AND $11, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 21  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS, CONTRACTS AND OTHER MATTERS ARE PENDING AGAINST US. MANY POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT LEGAL

PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO MATTERS COVERED BY OUR INSURANCE. POTENTIAL MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, FROM WHICH CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT OR HAVE RESULTED. SUCH PROCEEDINGS INVOLVE, OR COULD INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE

GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES, COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION AND/OR FORFEITURES. UNDER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, A COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS OPERATING DIVISIONS OR SUBDIVISIONS, CAN ALSO BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS, OR LOSE ITS EXPORT PRIVILEGES, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS. WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON CURRENT INFORMATION, THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH GOVERNMENT DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL POSITION, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW.

A-12 LITIGATION

IN 1991, THE U.S. NAVY NOTIFIED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION (NOW ONE OF OUR

SUBSIDIARIES) AND GENERAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION (TOGETHER, THE TEAM) THAT IT WAS TERMINATING FOR DEFAULT THE TEAMS CONTRACT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE A-12 AIRCRAFT. THE TEAM FILED A LEGAL ACTION TO CONTEST THE U.S.

NAVYS DEFAULT TERMINATION, TO ASSERT ITS RIGHTS TO CONVERT THE TERMINATION TO ONE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND TO OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COSTS INCURRED ON THE A-12 CONTRACT BUT NOT PAID TO DATE. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2007, INVENTORIES INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $584 OF RECORDED COSTS ON THE A-12 CONTRACT, AGAINST WHICH WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LOSS PROVISION OF $350. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVISION, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1990, WAS BASED ON MCDONNELL

DOUGLAS CORPORATIONS BELIEF, SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WOULD BE CONVERTED TO A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, AND THAT THE BEST ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE LOSS ON TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE WAS $350.

ON AUGUST 31, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ISSUED A

DECISION AFTER TRIAL UPHOLDING THE GOVERNMENTS DEFAULT TERMINATION OF THE A-12 CONTRACT. IN 2003, THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT, FINDING THAT THE TRIAL COURT HAD APPLIED THE WRONG LEGAL STANDARD, VACATED THE TRIAL COURTS

2001 DECISION AND ORDERED THE CASE SENT BACK TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. ON MAY 3, 2007, THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ISSUED A DECISION UPHOLDING THE GOVERNMENTS DEFAULT TERMINATION OF THE A-12 CONTRACT. WE BELIEVE THAT THE

RULING RAISES SERIOUS ISSUES FOR APPEAL, AND ON MAY 4, 2007 WE FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL WHICH WE ARE NOW PURSUING IN THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT. THIS FOLLOWS AN EARLIER TRIAL COURT DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE TEAM AND REVERSAL OF

THAT INITIAL DECISION ON APPEAL.

IF, AFTER ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS HAVE

ENDED, THE COURTS DETERMINE, CONTRARY TO OUR BELIEF, THAT A TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WAS APPROPRIATE, WE WOULD INCUR AN ADDITIONAL LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $275, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF REMAINING INVENTORY COSTS AND ADJUSTMENTS, AND, IF THE COURTS

FURTHER HOLD THAT A MONEY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE ENTERED AGAINST THE TEAM, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ONE-HALF OF THE UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS OF $1,350 PLUS STATUTORY INTEREST FROM FEBRUARY 1991 (CURRENTLY TOTALING

APPROXIMATELY $1,350). IN THAT EVENT, OUR LOSS WOULD TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $1,621 IN PRE-TAX CHARGES. SHOULD, HOWEVER, THE MARCH 31, 1998 JUDGMENT OF THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS IN FAVOR OF THE TEAM BE REINSTATED, WE WOULD BE ENTITLED TO

RECEIVE PAYMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $1,087, INCLUDING INTEREST.

WE BELIEVE

THAT THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT IS CONTRARY TO LAW AND FACT AND THAT THE LOSS PROVISION ESTABLISHED BY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION IN 1990, WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION FROM OUTSIDE COUNSEL, CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR THE REASONABLY

POSSIBLE REDUCTION IN VALUE OF A-12

NET CONTRACTS IN PROCESS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007. FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE A-12 LITIGATION WILL DEPEND ON THE OUTCOME OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS OR POSSIBLE

NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

EMPLOYMENT AND BENEFITS LITIGATION

WE ARE A DEFENDANT IN TWO EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION CLASS ACTIONS.

IN THE WILLIAMS CLASS ACTION, WHICH WAS FILED ON JUNE 8, 1998 IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON (ALLEGING RACE DISCRIMINATION), WE PREVAILED IN A JURY TRIAL IN DECEMBER 2005, BUT PLAINTIFFS APPEALED THE PRE-TRIAL

DISMISSAL OF COMPENSATION CLAIMS IN NOVEMBER 2005. IN THE CALENDER CLASS ACTION, WHICH WAS FILED JANUARY 25, 2005 IN THE U.S. NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS (A SPIN-OFF FROM WILLIAMS ALLEGING RACE DISCRIMINATION), PLAINTIFFS DROPPED THEIR

PROMOTIONS CLAIM ON JUNE 6, 2006, AND PUT THEIR COMPENSATION CLAIMS ON HOLD PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE WILLIAMS APPEAL.

IN ADDITION, ON MARCH 2, 2006, WE WERE SERVED WITH A COMPLAINT FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS, ALLEGING THAT HIRING DECISIONS MADE

BY SPIRIT AEROSPACE NEAR THE TIME OF OUR SALE OF THE WICHITA FACILITY WERE TAINTED BY AGE DISCRIMINATION AND VIOLATED ERISA. THE CASE IS BROUGHT AS A CLASS ACTION ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUALS NOT HIRED BY SPIRIT. WE ARE INDEMNIFIED BY SPIRIT FOR ALL

CLAIMS RELATING TO THE 2005 SALES TRANSACTION PURSUANT TO THE TERMS OF THE ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH SPIRIT. SPIRIT HAS NOT AGREED TO INDEMNIFY US FOR ONE CLAIM, WHICH ALLEGES THAT LAYOFFS IN WICHITA FROM 2002  2005 WERE PART OF AN OVERALL

SCHEME TO ELIMINATE OLDER WORKERS AND REDUCE THE COST OF BENEFITS.

A

SECOND ALLEGED CLASS ACTION INVOLVING OUR SALE OF THE WICHITA FACILITY TO SPIRIT WAS FILED ON FEBRUARY 21, 2007, IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS. THE CASE IS ALSO BROUGHT UNDER ERISA, AND, IN GENERAL, CLAIMS THAT WE HAVE

NOT PROPERLY PROVIDED BENEFITS TO CERTAIN CATEGORIES OF FORMER EMPLOYEES AFFECTED BY THE SALE.

PLAINTIFFS HAVE BEEN EXHAUSTING THEIR ADMINISTRATIVE REMEDIES BY MAKING APPEALS TO OUR BENEFITS COMMITTEE; THAT PHASE OF THE CASE HAS BEEN

COMPLETED, AND IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE CASE WILL MOVE INTO THE EARLY STAGES OF DISCOVERY.

ON SEPTEMBER 13, 2006, TWO UAW LOCAL 1069 RETIREES FILED A CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT IN THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE ALLEGING THAT RECENTLY ANNOUNCED CHANGES TO MEDICAL PLANS FOR RETIREES OF UAW LOCAL 1069

CONSTITUTED A BREACH OF COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS UNDER §301 OF THE LABOR-MANAGEMENT RELATIONS ACT AND §502(A)(1)(B) OF ERISA. ON SEPTEMBER 15, 2006, WE FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS AGAINST THE

INTERNATIONAL UAW AND TWO RETIREE MEDICAL PLAN PARTICIPANTS SEEKING A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT CONFIRMING THAT THE COMPANY HAS THE LEGAL RIGHT TO MAKE CHANGES TO THESE MEDICAL BENEFITS. ON JUNE 4, 2007, THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF TENNESSEE ORDERED THAT

ITS CASE BE TRANSFERRED TO THE NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS. THE TWO CASES WERE CONSOLIDATED ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2007. THE UAW FILED A MOTION TO FILE A SECOND AMENDED COMPLAINT ON OCTOBER 26, 2007 IN WHICH IT SOUGHT TO DROP THE

RETIREES CLAIM FOR VESTED LIFETIME BENEFITS BASED ON SUCCESSIVE COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND INSTEAD ALLEGE THAT THE CURRENT COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT IS THE SOLE ALLEGED SOURCE OF RIGHTS TO RETIREE MEDICAL BENEFITS. WE OPPOSED

THE MOTION. ON JANUARY 17, 2008, THE COURT GRANTED THE MOTION TO AMEND THE COMPLAINT ON THE CONDITION THAT THE LIFETIME RETIREE BENEFITS CLAIMS ARE TO BE DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE. THE PLAINTIFFS COUNSEL IS NOW CONSIDERING WHETHER TO

ACCEPT THE CONDITION OR WITHDRAW THE AMENDED COMPLAINT. IN ADDITION, BOTH PARTIES FILED MOTIONS FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION ON NOVEMBER 16, 2007. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN ADVERSE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

ON OCTOBER 13, 2006, WE WERE

NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN A LAWSUIT FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS. PLAINTIFFS, SEEKING TO REPRESENT A CLASS OF SIMILARLY SITUATED PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES IN THE BOEING COMPANY VOLUNTARY INVESTMENT PLAN

(THE VIP PLAN), ALLEGED THAT FEES AND EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE VIP PLAN WERE AND ARE UNREASONABLE AND EXCESSIVE, NOT INCURRED SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE VIP PLAN AND ITS PARTICIPANTS, AND WERE UNDISCLOSED TO PARTICIPANTS. THE PLAINTIFFS FURTHER

ALLEGED THAT DEFENDANTS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES IN VIOLATION OF §502(A)(2) OF ERISA, AND

101

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SOUGHT INJUNCTIVE AND EQUITABLE RELIEF PURSUANT TO §502(A)(3) OF ERISA. PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED A MOTION TO CERTIFY THE CLASS, WHICH WE HAVE OPPOSED. ON

SEPTEMBER 10, 2007, THE COURT ISSUED AN ORDER STAYING CLASS CERTIFICATION PENDING RESOLUTION BY THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT OF

LIVELY V. DYNEGY, INC.

ON DECEMBER 14, 2007, THE COURT GRANTED PLAINTIFFS LEAVE TO

FILE AN AMENDED COMPLAINT, WHICH COMPLAINT ADDED OUR EMPLOYEE BENEFITS INVESTMENT COMMITTEE AS A DEFENDANT AND INCLUDED NEW ALLEGATIONS REGARDING ALLEGED BREACH OF FIDUCIARY DUTY. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN ADVERSE

OUTCOME WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

BSSI/ICO

LITIGATION

ON AUGUST 16, 2004, BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS

INTERNATIONAL, INC. (BSSI) FILED A COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AGAINST ICO GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS (OPERATIONS), LTD. (ICO) IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. BSSIS SUIT SEEKS A DECLARATION THAT ICOS PRIOR TERMINATION OF TWO

CONTRACTS FOR CONVENIENCE EXTINGUISHED ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2004, ICO FILED A CROSS

-

COMPLAINT ALLEGING BREACH OF CONTRACT, ECONOMIC DURESS, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, AND OTHER CLAIMS. ICO ADDED US AS A

DEFENDANT IN OCTOBER 2005 TO SOME OF THESE CLAIMS AND ALSO SUED US FOR INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT AND MISAPPROPRIATION OF TRADE SECRETS. ON JANUARY 13, 2006, BSSI FILED A CROSS-COMPLAINT AGAINST ICO, ICO GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS (HOLDINGS) LIMITED

(ICO HOLDINGS), ICOS PARENT, AND EAGLE RIVER INVESTMENTS, LLC, PARENT OF BOTH ICO AND ICO HOLDINGS, ALLEGING FRAUD AND OTHER CLAIMS. IN ITS CLAIMS, ICO SEEKS TO RECOVER DAMAGES SIGNIFICANTLY IN EXCESS OF THE $2,400 CONTRACT PRICE. MORE

SPECIFICALLY, ICO SEEKS TO RECOVER ALL MONIES PAID TO BSSI AND BOEING LAUNCH SERVICES; THE COSTS IT INCURRED IN SHUTTING DOWN CERTAIN ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS; SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGES FOR ALLEGED DIMINUTION IN THE VALUE OF ITS BUSINESS; AND OTHER

UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND RELIEF. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE DEFENSES TO ICOS CAUSES OF ACTION AND DAMAGE CLAIMS AND ARE PURSUING OUR OWN CLAIMS. TRIAL IS SET FOR APRIL 2008.

BSSI/THURAYA LITIGATION

ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2004, A GROUP OF INSURANCE UNDERWRITERS FOR THURAYA SATELLITE TELECOMMUNICATIONS (THURAYA) REQUESTED ARBITRATION BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL

CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC) AGAINST BSSI. THE REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION ALLEGES THAT BSSI BREACHED ITS CONTRACT WITH THURAYA FOR SALE OF A MODEL 702 SATELLITE THAT EXPERIENCED POWER LOSS ANOMALIES. THE ARBITRATION HEARING HAS BEEN SCHEDULED FOR APRIL

2008 AND THE ARBITRATION DECISION IS EXPECTED TO BE ISSUED LATER IN 2008. THE CLAIMANTS SEEK APPROXIMATELY $199 (PLUS CLAIMS OF INTEREST, COSTS AND FEES) CONSISTING OF INSURANCE PAYMENTS MADE TO THURAYA, AND THEY FURTHER RESERVED THE RIGHT TO SEEK

AN ADDITIONAL $38 THAT HAS BEEN IN DISPUTE BETWEEN THURAYA AND SOME INSURERS AND WAS REPORTEDLY RECENTLY RESOLVED. THURAYA HAS RESERVED ITS RIGHTS TO SEEK UNINSURED LOSSES THAT COULD INCREASE THE TOTAL AMOUNT DISPUTED TO $365. WE BELIEVE THESE

CLAIMS LACK MERIT AND INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM.

WE HAVE

INSURANCE COVERAGE TO RESPOND TO THIS ARBITRATION REQUEST AND HAVE NOTIFIED RESPONSIBLE INSURERS. ON MAY 26, 2006, A GROUP OF THESE INSURERS FILED A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY ASSERTING CERTAIN DEFENSES TO

COVERAGE AND REQUESTING A DECLARATION OF THEIR OBLIGATION UNDER OUR INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE POLICIES RELATING TO THE THURAYA ICC ARBITRATION. WE BELIEVE THE INSURERS POSITION LACKS MERIT. ON MAY 25, 2007, THE COURT STAYED FURTHER

PROCEEDINGS IN THE COVERAGE ACTION PENDING COMPLETION OF THE ARBITRATION BUT INSURERS HAVE APPEALED THAT ORDER.

BSSI/TELESAT CANADA

ON NOVEMBER 9, 2006, TELESAT CANADA (TELESAT) AND A GROUP OF ITS INSURERS SERVED BSSI WITH AN ARBITRATION DEMAND ALLEGING BREACH OF CONTRACT, GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND WILLFUL MISCONDUCT IN CONNECTION WITH

THE CONSTRUCTIVE TOTAL LOSS OF ANIK F1, A MODEL 702 SATELLITE MANUFACTURED BY BSSI. TELESAT AND ITS

102

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INSURERS SEEK OVER $385 IN DAMAGES AND $10 IN LOST PROFITS. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CLAIMS ASSERTED BY TELESAT AND ITS INSURERS LACK MERIT BUT HAVE NONETHELESS NOTIFIED

OUR INSURANCE CARRIERS OF THE DEMAND.

ON APRIL 26, 2007, A GROUP OF

OUR INSURERS FILED A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY ASSERTING CERTAIN DEFENSES TO COVERAGE AND REQUESTING A DECLARATION OF THEIR OBLIGATION UNDER OUR INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE POLICIES RELATING TO THE THREATENED

TELESAT ANIK F1 ARBITRATION. WE BELIEVE THE INSURERS POSITION LACKS MERIT AND INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY LITIGATE THE COVERAGE ISSUE.

BSSI/SUPERBIRD-6 LITIGATION

ON DECEMBER 1, 2006, BSSI WAS SERVED WITH AN ARBITRATION DEMAND IN SUBROGATION BROUGHT BY INSURERS FOR SPACE COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION ALLEGING BREACH OF WARRANTY, BREACH OF CONTRACT AND GROSS

NEGLIGENCE RELATING TO THE SUPERBIRD-6 COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITE, WHICH SUFFERED A LOW PERIGEE EVENT SHORTLY AFTER LAUNCH IN APRIL 2004. THE LOW ORBIT ALLEGEDLY DAMAGED THE SATELLITE, AND A SUBSEQUENT DECISION TO DE-ORBIT THE SATELLITE WAS MADE LESS

THAN 12 MONTHS AFTER LAUNCH. THE MODEL 601 SATELLITE WAS MANUFACTURED BY BSSI AND DELIVERED FOR LAUNCH BY INTERNATIONAL LAUNCH SERVICES ON AN ATLAS LAUNCH VEHICLE. THE INSURERS SEEK TO RECOVER IN EXCESS OF $240 FROM BSSI. WE BELIEVE THE

INSURERS CLAIMS LACK MERIT AND INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. THE ARBITRATION HEARING IS SCHEDULED TO BEGIN IN OCTOBER 2008.

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF THE BOEING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007,

BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO

EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL

WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS,

MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A

COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE

ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF

THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE

COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE

PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES

IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2007, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL

 INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE AS OF AND FOR

THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2007 OF THE COMPANY AND OUR REPORT DATED FEBRUARY 13, 2008 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE.
