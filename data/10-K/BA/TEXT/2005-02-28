PART 1

ITEM 1. BUSINESS

THE BOEING COMPANY,

TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES (HEREIN REFERRED TO AS WE, US, OUR), IS ONE OF THE WORLDS MAJOR AEROSPACE FIRMS. WE ARE ORGANIZED BASED ON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE OFFER. WE OPERATE IN SIX PRINCIPAL

SEGMENTS: COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES; AIRCRAFT AND WEAPON SYSTEMS (A&WS), NETWORK SYSTEMS, SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND LAUNCH AND ORBITAL SYSTEMS (L&OS), COLLECTIVELY INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS (IDS); AND BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION (BCC). WE ALSO

ESTABLISHED AN OTHER SEGMENT CLASSIFICATION WHICH PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES THE ACTIVITIES OF CONNEXION BY BOEING

SM

, A TWO-WAY DATA

COMMUNICATIONS SERVICE FOR GLOBAL TRAVELERS; AND BOEING TECHNOLOGY, AN ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, IMPROVED PROCESSES AND THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS. EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2004, AIR TRAFFIC

MANAGEMENT, A BUSINESS UNIT DEVELOPING NEW APPROACHES TO A GLOBAL SOLUTION TO ADDRESS AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT ISSUES, WAS ABSORBED INTO PHANTOM WORKS RESEARCH DIVISION WHICH IS INCLUDED WITHIN BOEING TECHNOLOGY.

REVENUES, EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS

FOR THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, ARE SET FORTH ON PAGES 118-123 OF THIS REPORT.

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT

THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

SEGMENT IS INVOLVED IN DEVELOPING, PRODUCING AND MARKETING COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT AND PROVIDING RELATED SUPPORT SERVICES, PRINCIPALLY TO THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE. WE ARE A LEADING PRODUCER OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND OFFER A FAMILY

OF COMMERCIAL JETLINERS DESIGNED TO MEET A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PASSENGER AND CARGO REQUIREMENTS OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN AIRLINES. THIS FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT CURRENTLY INCLUDES THE 717 AND 737 NEXT-GENERATION NARROW-BODY MODELS AND THE 747,

767 AND 777 AND 787 WIDE-BODY MODELS. DUE TO LACK OF DEMAND FOR THE 757 PROGRAM, A DECISION WAS MADE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 TO END PRODUCTION OF THE PROGRAM. FINAL DELIVERY OF THE 757 AIRCRAFT IS SCHEDULED TO OCCUR IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2005.

ON JANUARY 12, 2005 WE DECIDED TO CONCLUDE PRODUCTION OF THE 717 COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE IN 2006 DUE TO THE LACK OF OVERALL MARKET DEMAND FOR THE AIRPLANE.

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT ARE NORMALLY SOLD ON A FIXED-PRICE BASIS WITH AN INDEXED PRICE ESCALATION CLAUSE. OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER JET AIRCRAFT ON SCHEDULE DEPENDS ON

A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXECUTION OF INTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS, AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AND REGULATORY CERTIFICATION. THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW AND DERIVATIVE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS

INVOLVES INCREASED RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND CERTIFICATION SCHEDULES.

THE COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT MARKET AND THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REMAIN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT THE EXISTING LONG-TERM DOWNWARD TREND IN PASSENGER REVENUE YIELDS WORLDWIDE (MEASURED IN REAL TERMS) TO

CONTINUE INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. MARKET LIBERALIZATION IN EUROPE AND ASIA HAS CONTINUED TO ENABLE LOW-COST AIRLINES TO GAIN MARKET SHARE. THESE AIRLINES HAVE INCREASED THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON AIRFARES. THIS RESULTS IN CONTINUED COST PRESSURES

FOR ALL AIRLINES AND PRICE PRESSURE ON OUR PRODUCTS. MAJOR PRODUCTIVITY GAINS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE A FAVORABLE MARKET POSITION AT ACCEPTABLE PROFIT MARGINS.

WORLD-WIDE AIR TRAVEL EXPERIENCED A STRONG REBOUND IN 2004. THIS REBOUND IS NOTABLE IN THAT IT REPRESENTS A RECOVERY FROM THE LEVELS OF 2003 WHICH WERE DEPRESSED

BY THE SARS OUTBREAK IN ASIA, AND REPRESENTS A TRAFFIC LEVEL THAT EXCEEDS THE PREVIOUS RECORD WHICH WAS SET IN 2000. IT HAS TAKEN THE INDUSTRY 4 YEARS TO EXCEED THAT LEVEL, INDICATING THE DIFFICULTIES FACED BY THE WORLDS AIRLINES AS THEY HAVE

DEALT WITH THE EFFECTS OF RECESSION, TERRORISM, AND DISEASE. THIS TRAFFIC VOLUME HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY STRONG WORLD-WIDE ECONOMIC GROWTH WHICH STIMULATES DEMAND, AND DECLINING REAL AIRLINE YIELDS WHICH MAKES AIR TRAVEL MORE AFFORDABLE TO MORE PEOPLE.

1

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE CURRENT MODELS, AND ASSESS THE MARKETPLACE TO ENSURE THAT OUR

FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT IS WELL POSITIONED TO MEET FUTURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. THE FUNDAMENTAL STRATEGY IS TO MAINTAIN A BROAD PRODUCT LINE THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS BY MAXIMIZING COMMONALITY AMONG

OUR FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BY OFFERING PRODUCTS WITH THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF QUALITY, SAFETY, TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE, ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND

IN-SERVICE SUPPORT.

THE MAJOR FOCUS OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN THE THE 747-400ER, THE 747-400ERF, THE 747-400SF, THE 777-200LR, THE 777-300ER, AND THE 787. CERTIFICATION AND FIRST DELIVERY OF THE 747-400ER AND 747-400ERF OCCURRED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002.

CERTIFICATION AND FIRST DELIVERY OF THE 777-300ER OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2004. CERTIFICATION AND FIRST DELIVERY OF THE 777-200LR IS SCHEDULED FOR THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2006. CERTIFICATION AND FIRST DELIVERY OF THE 787 IS SCHEDULED FOR THE

FIRST HALF OF 2008.

WE ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSING OUR NEW AIRPLANE PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON THE 787 PROGRAM, WHICH WITH THE THREE PLANNED VERSIONS WILL SEAT 223 TO 296 PASSENGERS IN MULTIPLE CLASS CONFIGURATIONS. IN EARLY 2004, WE RECEIVED THE INITIAL LAUNCH ORDER FOR THE 787 AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS (BOD) APPROVAL TO

PROCEED WITH FULL DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION. WE PROJECT A CONTINUED INCREASE IN OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING IN 2005, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SPENDING ON THE 787 WHILE WE ALSO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP DERIVATIVES AND FEATURES FOR OUR OTHER PROGRAMS

PRIMARILY THE 737, 747-400 SPECIAL FREIGHTER MODIFICATION AND 777 PROGRAMS. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES DEVELOPMENT WORK TO SUPPORT THE MULTI-MISSION MARITIME AIRCRAFT (737) CONTRACT WITH THE US NAVY IS BEING DEFERRED AS PART OF THE CONTRACT COSTS,

NOT AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE SELECTED EVERETT, WASHINGTON AS THE FINAL ASSEMBLY LOCATION FOR THE 787 AIRCRAFT.

INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS SEGMENTS

IDS IS INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, MODIFICATION AND SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS AND RELATED SYSTEMS: MILITARY AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING FIGHTER, TRANSPORT AND ATTACK AIRCRAFT;

HELICOPTERS; MISSILES; SPACE SYSTEMS; MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS; SATELLITES AND SATELLITE LAUNCHING VEHICLES; ROCKET ENGINES; AND COMMUNICATION, INFORMATION AND BATTLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.

THE IDS BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT EXTENDS OVER MULTIPLE MARKETS, INCLUDING DEFENSE (A&WS, NETWORK SYSTEMS AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS),

HOMELAND SECURITY (NETWORK SYSTEMS), CIVIL SPACE TRANSPORTATION AND EXPLORATION (L&OS), AND LAUNCH AND SATELLITES (L&OS). IDS DERIVES OVER 85% OF ITS REVENUE FROM SALES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND WE ARE FORECASTING THIS BUSINESS MIX WILL

REMAIN AT THIS LEVEL INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. SPECIFICALLY, IDSS PRIMARY CUSTOMERS ARE THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN THE DEFENSE MARKET, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FOR THE HOMELAND SECURITY MARKET,

NASA FOR THE SPACE TRANSPORTATION AND EXPLORATION MARKET, AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL SATELLITE SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE LAUNCH AND SATELLITE MARKET.

THE MAJOR TRENDS THAT SHAPE THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF IDS INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT BUT RELATIVELY FLAT U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE AND SPACE

BUDGETS; RAPID EXPANSION OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES; AND THE NEED FOR LOW COST, ASSURED ACCESS TO SPACE.

THE 2005 DOD AUTHORIZATION WAS APPROVED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 AT A TOTAL LEVEL OF $400 BILLION (EXCLUDING SUPPLEMENTALS). ALTHOUGH UNDER PRESSURE, THE DOD

BUDGET REMAINS STRONG AND FOCUSED ON TRANSFORMATION. WITH THIS CONTINUED PRESSURE ON THE BUDGET THE DOD WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY STRATEGIES EMPHASIZING NETWORK-CENTRIC OPERATIONS, JOINT INTEROPERABILITY, LONG-RANGE STRIKE, UNMANNED

AIR COMBAT AND RECONNAISSANCE VEHICLES, PRECISION GUIDED WEAPONS AND CONTINUED PRIVATIZATION OF LOGISTICS AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS WHILE MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER COSTS. THIS WILL PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR

IDS PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE CONTINUING TO INVEST IN BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WHERE WE CAN USE OUR CUSTOMER KNOWLEDGE, TECHNICAL STRENGTH

AND LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES TO SHAPE THE MARKET. CURRENT MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE F/A-22 RAPTOR, V-22 OSPREY TILTROTOR AIRCRAFT, C-130 AVIONICS MODERNIZATION PROGRAM (AMP), THE UNMANNED COMBAT AIR VEHICLE (UCAV),

AND FUTURE COMBAT SYSTEMS (FCS). BOTH THE V-22 AND F/A-22 PROGRAMS HAVE TRANSITIONED TO LOW-RATE INITIAL PRODUCTION BUT ALSO CONTINUE DEVELOPMENTAL ACTIVITIES. CURRENT PRODUCTS IN THE TACTICAL MISSILES MARKET INCLUDE THE HARPOON BLOCK II, SLAM-ER,

CALCM AND THE JOINT DIRECT ATTACK MUNITION (JDAM). FUTURE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE SMALL DIAMETER BOMB. WE ARE AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING OPPORTUNITIES THAT UTILIZE HIGH-SPEED TECHNOLOGY FOR THE NEXT-GENERATION MISSILE.

INVESTMENTS IN UNMANNED SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE A&WS CAPABILITIES IN

ARCHITECTURES, SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND WEAPON SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE TRANSFORMATIONAL CAPABILITIES FOR THE U.S. MILITARY. OUR INVESTMENTS IN AIRBORNE ELECTRONIC ATTACK AND PRECISION WEAPONS AND ADVANCED ROTORCRAFT SYSTEMS ARE

EXPANDING THE BREADTH OF PRODUCTS AND CAPABILITIES ENABLING ACCESS TO LARGER PORTIONS OF THE COMBAT SYSTEMS MARKETS.

THE NETWORK SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING REMAINS FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNICATIONS AND COMMAND & CONTROL CAPABILITIES THAT SUPPORT A NETWORK-CENTRIC ARCHITECTURE APPROACH FOR OUR

VARIOUS GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS. IN THE COMMUNICATIONS MARKET, WE ARE INVESTING TO ENABLE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN EXISTING AIR/GROUND PLATFORMS, INCREASE COMMUNICATIONS AVAILABILITY AND BANDWIDTH THROUGH MORE ROBUST SPACE SYSTEMS, AND LEVERAGE INNOVATIVE

COMMUNICATIONS CONCEPTS. INVESTMENTS WERE ALSO MADE TO SUPPORT VARIOUS INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING MULTI MISSION MARITIME AIRCRAFT, AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING AND CONTROL AIRCRAFT, AND CONCEPTS THAT

WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEXT-GENERATION SPACE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS. A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR SUPPORT OF DOD TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMS IS THE INVESTMENT IN THE BOEING INTEGRATION CENTER (BIC) AND THE EXTENDED NETWORK OF MODELING, SIMULATION

AND ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES WHERE OUR NETWORK-CENTRIC OPERATIONS CONCEPTS ARE DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH ITS CUSTOMERS. ALONG WITH INCREASED FUNDING TO SUPPORT THESE AREAS OF ARCHITECTURE AND NETWORK-CENTRIC CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT, WE ALSO

MAINTAINED OUR INVESTMENT LEVELS IN GLOBAL MISSILE DEFENSE AND ADVANCED MISSILE DEFENSE CONCEPTS AND TECHNOLOGIES. IN 2004 WE CONTINUED INVESTMENT TO PURSUE THE HOMELAND SECURITY MARKET, WITH EMPHASIS ON FUNDING TO DEVELOP AND TAILOR THE

NETWORK-CENTRIC CAPABILITIES ALREADY BEING APPLIED TO MANY DOD OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS EMERGING MARKET.

ON JANUARY 14, 2004, PRESIDENT BUSH ANNOUNCED AN AMBITIOUS NEW VISION FOR THE U.S. SPACE EXPLORATION PROGRAM WITHIN NASA. THE PLAN CALLED FOR A COMMITMENT TO A LONG-TERM HUMAN AND ROBOTIC PROGRAM TO

EXPLORE THE SOLAR SYSTEM STARTING WITH A RETURN TO THE MOON THAT WILL ULTIMATELY ENABLE FUTURE EXPLORATION OF MARS AND OTHER DESTINATIONS. TO ACHIEVE THIS PLAN, THREE TOP-LEVEL GOALS WERE ESTABLISHED. THE FIRST WAS FOR THE U.S. TO COMPLETE ITS WORK

ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION BY 2010. TO ACCOMPLISH THIS GOAL, NASA WILL RETURN THE SPACE SHUTTLE TO FLIGHT. THE SECOND, WAS TO DEVELOP A NEW MANNED EXPLORATION VEHICLE TO EXPLORE BEYOND OUR ORBIT TO OTHER WORLDS. THIS WORK ON A CREW

EXPLORATION VEHICLE WAS BEGUN IN 2004. THE FINAL GOAL IS TO RETURN TO THE MOON AS EARLY AS 2015, AND USE IT AS A STEPPING STONE FOR MORE AMBITIOUS MISSIONS.

WITHIN THE L&OS SEGMENT, WE CONTINUED TO INVEST IN THE NEW DELTA IV HEAVY LIFT DEMONSTRATION EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE, WHICH SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETED ITS

INAUGURAL LAUNCH AND MET THE MAJOR TEST OBJECTIVES ESTABLISHED BY OUR CUSTOMER. THIS PRODUCT PROVIDES US GREATER ACCESS TO A PORTION OF THE LAUNCH MARKET THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY UNAVAILABLE WITH THE DELTA II ROCKET ALONE.

THE ACQUISITION AND MERGER RELATED CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG U.S. AEROSPACE COMPANIES

RESULTED IN THREE PRINCIPAL PRIME CONTRACTORS FOR THE DOD AND NASA, INCLUDING OURSELVES. AS A RESULT OF THE EXTENSIVE CONSOLIDATION IN THE DEFENSE AND SPACE INDUSTRY, WE ALONG WITH OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS ARE ALSO PARTNERS OR MAJOR SUPPLIERS TO EACH

OTHER ON VARIOUS PROGRAMS. WE ARE IN A 50% PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCKHEED

UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE ALSO PERFORMS MODIFICATIONS, TESTING AND CHECKOUT OPERATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO READY THE SPACE SHUTTLE FOR LAUNCH. UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE OPERATIONS ARE PERFORMED UNDER COST-TYPE CONTRACTS. OUR PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF JOINT

VENTURE EARNINGS IS RECOGNIZED AS INCOME.

THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE, IN

WHICH WE ARE A 40% PARTNER WITH RSC ENERGIA (25%) OF RUSSIA, KVAERNER ASA (20%) OF NORWAY, AND KB YUZHNOYE/PO YUZHMASH (15%) OF UKRAINE, PROVIDES OCEAN-BASED LAUNCH SERVICES TO COMMERCIAL SATELLITE CUSTOMERS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004,

THE VENTURE CONDUCTED THREE LAUNCHES. THE VENTURE ALSO CONDUCTED THREE LAUNCHES IN 2003. OUR INVESTMENT IN THIS VENTURE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, REFLECTS THE RECOGNITION OF BOEINGS SHARE OF LOSSES REPORTED BY SEA LAUNCH IN PRIOR YEARS. THE

VENTURE INCURRED LOSSES IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, DUE TO THE RELATIVELY LOW VOLUME OF LAUNCHES, REFLECTING A DEPRESSED COMMERCIAL SATELLITE MARKET.

BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION SEGMENT

BCCS STRATEGIC DIRECTION HAS SHIFTED FROM A FOCUS ON GROWING THE PORTFOLIO TO A FOCUS ON SUPPORTING OUR MAJOR OPERATING UNITS AND MANAGING OVERALL PORTFOLIO RISK EXPOSURES. FOR THE COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT MARKET, BCC FACILITATES, ARRANGES, STRUCTURES AND/OR PROVIDES SELECTIVE FINANCING SOLUTIONS TO OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT CUSTOMERS. FOR THE DEFENSE AND SPACE MARKETS, BCC PRIMARILY ENGAGES IN ARRANGING AND STRUCTURING FINANCING

SOLUTIONS FOR OUR IDS SEGMENT GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION, BCC CONTINUES TO ENHANCE ITS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES TO MANAGE EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS CURRENT PORTFOLIO AND FUTURE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES. BCCS PORTFOLIO CONSISTED OF

FINANCING LEASES, NOTES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES, INVESTMENTS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE.

ON MAY 24, 2004, BCC ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION (GECC) TO SELL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS RELATED TO

ITS FORMER COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH WAS COMPLETED BY DECEMBER 31, 2004. AS A RESULT, THE COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS IS REFLECTED AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS.

WE INCURRED

EMPLOYMENT REDUCTIONS RESULTING FROM THE DECREASE IN COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT DEMAND, WHICH DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001.

COMPETITION

THE COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT MARKET AND THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REMAIN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE FACE AGGRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS, INCLUDING AIRBUS, THAT ARE INTENT ON INCREASING THEIR MARKET SHARE. TO EFFECTIVELY COMPETE,

WE FOCUS ON IMPROVING OUR PROCESSES AND CONTINUING COST REDUCTION EFFORTS. WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE OUR EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES NETWORK FOR AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO PROVIDE A HIGHER LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND PRODUCTIVITY.

IDS FACES STRONG COMPETITION IN ALL MARKET SEGMENTS, PRIMARILY FROM

LOCKHEED MARTIN, NORTHROP GRUMMAN, AND RAYTHEON. FOREIGN COMPANIES SUCH AS BAE SYSTEMS AND EADS CONTINUE TO BUILD A STRATEGIC PRESENCE IN THE U.S. MARKET BY STRENGTHENING THEIR NORTH AMERICAN OPERATIONS AND PARTNERING WITH U.S. DEFENSE COMPANIES.

THE ACQUISITION AND MERGER RELATED CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG U.S. AEROSPACE

COMPANIES RESULTED IN THREE PRINCIPAL PRIME CONTRACTORS FOR THE DOD AND NASA, INCLUDING OUR COMPANY. AS A RESULT OF THE EXTENSIVE CONSOLIDATION IN THE DEFENSE AND SPACE INDUSTRY, WE ALONG WITH OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS ARE ALSO PARTNERS OR MAJOR

SUPPLIERS TO EACH OTHER ON VARIOUS PROGRAMS.

REGULATORY MATTERS

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED IN MOST OF OUR

MARKETS. WE DEAL WITH NUMEROUS U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND ENTITIES, INCLUDING ALL OF THE BRANCHES OF THE U.S. MILITARY, NASA, AND HOMELAND SECURITY. SIMILAR GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES EXIST IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS, MAY TERMINATE ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS AT THEIR CONVENIENCE AS WELL AS FOR DEFAULT BASED ON OUR FAILURE TO MEET SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS. IF ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WERE TO BE TERMINATED FOR CONVENIENCE, WE GENERALLY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PAYMENT FOR

WORK COMPLETED AND ALLOWABLE TERMINATION OR CANCELLATION COSTS. IF ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WERE TO BE TERMINATED FOR DEFAULT, GENERALLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD PAY ONLY FOR THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AND CAN REQUIRE US TO PAY THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT PRICE AND THE COST TO RE-PROCURE THE CONTRACT ITEMS, NET OF THE WORK ACCEPTED FROM THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN ALSO HOLD US LIABLE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE DEFAULT.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.

IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTS ARE

REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS GOVERNING PRODUCTION AND QUALITY SYSTEMS, AIRWORTHINESS, AND INSTALLATION APPROVALS, REPAIR PROCEDURES AND CONTINUING OPERATIONAL SAFETY. INTERNATIONALLY, SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS EXIST

FOR AIRWORTHINESS, INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONAL APPROVALS. THESE REQUIREMENTS ARE GENERALLY ADMINISTERED BY THE NATIONAL AVIATION AUTHORITIES OF EACH COUNTRY AND, IN THE CASE OF EUROPE, COORDINATED BY THE EUROPEAN JOINT AVIATION AUTHORITIES.

ENVIRONMENTAL.

OUR OPERATIONS ARE SUBJECT TO AND AFFECTED BY A

VARIETY OF FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND FOREIGN ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE DISCHARGE, TREATMENT, STORAGE, DISPOSAL, INVESTIGATION AND REMEDIATION OF CERTAIN MATERIALS, SUBSTANCES AND WASTES. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OUR COMPLIANCE

STATUS AND MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS AND BELIEVE THAT OUR OPERATIONS ARE IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

OPERATING AND MAINTENANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF CONTAMINATED SITES ARE A NORMAL, RECURRING

PART OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. THESE COSTS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANT RELATIVE TO TOTAL OPERATING COSTS OR CASH FLOWS, AND OFTEN ARE ALLOWABLE COSTS UNDER OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THESE COSTS HAVE NOT BEEN MATERIAL IN THE PAST. BASED

ON INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE TO US AND CURRENT U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICIES RELATING TO ALLOWABLE COSTS, WE DO NOT EXPECT CONTINUED COMPLIANCE TO HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR CASH FLOWS.

A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY (PRP) HAS JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY UNDER EXISTING

U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WHERE WE HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED A PRP BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY OR A STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY, WE ARE POTENTIALLY LIABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT OR THIRD PARTIES FOR THE FULL COST OF REMEDIATING CONTAMINATION AT OUR

FACILITIES OR FORMER FACILITIES OR AT THIRD-PARTY SITES. IF WE WERE REQUIRED TO FULLY FUND THE REMEDIATION OF A SITE, THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK WOULD ALLOW US TO PURSUE RIGHTS TO CONTRIBUTION FROM OTHER PRPS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO THE

IMPACT OF ENVIRONMENTAL CONTROLS, SEE NOTE 23 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONTAINED IN PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM 10-K.

INTERNATIONAL.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTAL REGULATIONS AND PROCUREMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES, INCLUDING REGULATIONS

RELATING TO IMPORT-EXPORT CONTROL, INVESTMENT, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. INTERNATIONAL SALES AND ALSO SUBJECT TO VARYING CURRENCY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS.

RAW MATERIALS AND SUPPLIERS

WE ARE DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY SOURCES, SUCH AS ELECTRICITY, AT AFFORDABLE PRICES. WE ARE ALSO HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ESSENTIAL

MATERIALS, PARTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS. THE MOST IMPORTANT RAW MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR OUR AEROSPACE PRODUCTS ARE ALUMINUM (SHEET, PLATE, FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS), TITANIUM (SHEET, PLATE, FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS) AND

COMPOSITES (INCLUDING CARBON AND BORON). ALTHOUGH ALTERNATIVE SOURCES GENERALLY EXIST FOR THESE RAW MATERIALS, QUALIFICATION OF THE SOURCES COULD TAKE A YEAR OR MORE. MANY MAJOR COMPONENTS AND PRODUCT EQUIPMENT ITEMS ARE PROCURED OR SUBCONTRACTED ON

A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS WITH A NUMBER OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN COMPANIES. WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY OF OUR LARGE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO MEET PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS, QUALITY STANDARDS, AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES AT ANTICIPATED

COSTS, AND THEIR FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AND CONTRACT PROFITABILITY, WHILE JEOPARDIZING OUR ABILITY TO FULFILL COMMITMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE MAINTAIN AN EXTENSIVE QUALIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE SURVEILLANCE

SYSTEM TO CONTROL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

INTRODUCTION

WE ARE A GLOBAL MARKET LEADER IN DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT, MANUFACTURING, SALE AND SUPPORT OF COMMERCIAL JETLINERS, MILITARY AIRCRAFT,

SATELLITES, MISSILE DEFENSE, HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT AND LAUNCH SYSTEMS AND SERVICES. WE ARE ONE OF THE TWO MAJOR MANUFACTURERS OF 100+ SEAT AIRPLANES FOR THE WORLDWIDE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY AND THE UNITED STATES SECOND-LARGEST DEFENSE

CONTRACTOR. WHILE OUR PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS ARE IN THE UNITED STATES, WE RELY EXTENSIVELY ON A NETWORK OF PARTNERS, KEY SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS LOCATED AROUND THE GLOBE.

WE OPERATE IN SIX PRINCIPAL SEGMENTS: COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES; AIRCRAFT AND WEAPON SYSTEMS (A&WS), NETWORK SYSTEMS, SUPPORT SYSTEMS,

AND LAUNCH AND ORBITAL SYSTEMS (L&OS) COLLECTIVELY INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS (IDS); AND BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION (BCC). ALL OTHER ACTIVITIES FALL WITHIN THE OTHER SEGMENT, PRINCIPALLY MADE UP OF BOEING TECHNOLOGY AND CONNEXION BY

BOEING

SM

. OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES OPERATIONS PRIMARILY INVOLVE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT AND

PROVIDING RELATED SUPPORT SERVICES, MAINLY TO THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE. IDS OPERATIONS PRINCIPALLY INVOLVE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, MODIFICATION AND SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS AND RELATED SYSTEMS: MILITARY AIRCRAFT,

HELICOPTERS AND MISSILES, SPACE SYSTEMS, MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS, SATELLITES AND SATELLITE LAUNCHING VEHICLES, ROCKET ENGINES, AND INFORMATION AND BATTLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. BCC IS PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN SUPPORTING OUR MAJOR OPERATING UNITS BY

FACILITATING, ARRANGING, STRUCTURING AND/OR PROVIDING SELECTIVE FINANCING SOLUTIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND MANAGING OVERALL PORTFOLIO RISK EXPOSURES. BOEING TECHNOLOGY IS AN ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION FOCUSED ON INNOVATIVE

TECHNOLOGIES, IMPROVED PROCESSES AND THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS. CONNEXION BY BOEING

SM

PROVIDES TWO-WAY BROADBAND DATA COMMUNICATIONS

SERVICE FOR GLOBAL TRAVELERS. EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2004, AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT WAS ABSORBED INTO PHANTOM WORKS RESEARCH DIVISION WHICH IS INCLUDED WITHIN BOEING TECHNOLOGY. FINANCING ACTIVITIES OTHER THAN THOSE CARRIED OUT BY BCC ARE ALSO INCLUDED

WITHIN THE OTHER SEGMENT CLASSIFICATION.

OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY IS

CENTERED ON RUNNING HEALTHY CORE BUSINESSES  COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES AND IDS SUPPLEMENTED AND SUPPORTED BY BCC. TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE CORE BUSINESSES GENERATE SUBSTANTIAL EARNINGS AND CASH FLOW TO PERMIT US TO INVEST INTO NEW PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AND TO OPEN NEW FRONTIERS IN AEROSPACE. OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES BUSINESS HAS BEEN LEAN AND PROFITABLE DESPITE SEVERE RECENT DOWNTURN IN COMMERCIAL AVIATION. WE ARE FOCUSED ON PRODUCING THE AIRPLANES THE MARKET DEMANDS AND WE PRICE OUR

PRODUCTS TO PROVIDE A FAIR RETURN FOR OUR SHAREHOLDERS WHILE CONTINUING TO FIND NEW WAYS TO IMPROVE EFFICIENCY AND QUALITY. IDS IS MORE THAN A COLLECTION OF DEFENSE PROGRAMS THAT ACTS AS A COUNTERWEIGHT TO THE CYCLICAL COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE BUSINESS.

IT IS A DYNAMIC BUSINESS WITH A STRATEGY TO ESTABLISH OURSELVES AS THE LEADING INDUSTRY PARTNER TO GOVERNMENTS IN DEVELOPING AN EFFECTIVE DEFENSE SYSTEM AGAINST CONVENTIONAL AND NON-CONVENTIONAL THREATS. BCC DELIVERS VALUE THROUGH SUPPORTING OUR

BUSINESS UNITS AND REDUCING OUR CUSTOMER FINANCING EXPOSURES. BOEING TECHNOLOGY, OUR ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT UNIT, PROVIDES NEW SYSTEMS, TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCESSES TO POSITION US FOR FUTURE GROWTH. CONNEXION BY BOEING

SM

MAKES AN AIRPLANE SEEM MORE LIKE THE OFFICE OR HOME WITH INTERNET CONNECTION AT ANYTIME AND ANYWHERE.

RISK FACTORS

WE GENERALLY MAKE SALES UNDER PURCHASE ORDERS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION, MODIFICATION OR RESCHEDULING WITHOUT SIGNIFICANT

PENALTIES TO OUR CUSTOMERS. CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY OR CONTINUING AVAILABILITY OF THE U.S. CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS COULD RESULT IN CUSTOMER REQUESTS FOR RESCHEDULING OR

CANCELLATION OF CONTRACTUAL ORDERS.

WE DEPEND ON A LIMITED NUMBER OF

CUSTOMERS, INCLUDING THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINES. WE CAN MAKE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY CUSTOMER WILL PURCHASE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM US AFTER OUR CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER HAS ENDED. THE LOSS OF A U.S. GOVERNMENT

MAJOR PROGRAM

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OR ANY OF THE MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINES AS CUSTOMERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES. SEVERAL OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY

PROTECTION.

WE ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ESSENTIAL

MATERIALS AND PARTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS. THE MOST IMPORTANT RAW MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR OUR AEROSPACE PRODUCTS INCLUDE ALUMINUM AND TITANIUM (SHEET, PLATE, FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS). ALTHOUGH ALTERNATIVE SOURCES GENERALLY EXIST FOR

THESE RAW MATERIALS, QUALIFICATION OF THE SOURCES COULD TAKE A YEAR OR MORE. MANY MAJOR COMPONENTS AND PRODUCT EQUIPMENT ITEMS ARE PROCURED OR SUBCONTRACTED ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS WITH A NUMBER OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN COMPANIES. WE ARE DEPENDENT

UPON THE ABILITY OF OUR LARGE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO MEET PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS, QUALITY STANDARDS, AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES AT ANTICIPATED COSTS, AND THEIR FAILURE TO DO SO COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AND

CONTRACT PROFITABILITY, WHILE JEOPARDIZING OUR ABILITY TO FULFILL COMMITMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE MAINTAIN AN EXTENSIVE QUALIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO CONTROL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES.

SALES OUTSIDE THE U.S. (PRINCIPALLY EXPORT SALES FROM DOMESTIC OPERATIONS) BY

GEOGRAPHIC AREA ARE INCLUDED ON PAGE 118. APPROXIMATELY 2% OF TOTAL SALES WERE DERIVED FROM NON-U.S. OPERATIONS FOR EACH YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 AND 1% FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002. APPROXIMATELY 47% OF OUR CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS WITH NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS COMPARED TO 41% AT DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 40% AT DECEMBER 31, 2002. SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE INFLUENCED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT FOREIGN POLICY, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TRADE POLICIES OF

GOVERNMENTS WORLDWIDE. RELATIVE PROFITABILITY IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT EXPERIENCED IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE INDUSTRY EXPERIENCED A STRONG YEAR IN 2004. COMMERCIAL JETLINER DELIVERIES STABILIZED AFTER TWO YEARS OF STEEP DECLINES. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTINUED TO INCREASE DEFENSE SPENDING

AND PROCEEDED WITH THE MILITARY TRANSFORMATION. ON THE OTHER HAND, WE CONTINUED TO FACE NUMEROUS CHALLENGES. COMPETITION FROM AIRBUS AND REGIONAL JET MAKERS INTENSIFIED AS THEY EXPAND AIRPLANE MODEL OFFERINGS AND COMPETITIVELY PRICE THEIR PRODUCTS.

MANY AIRLINES, PARTICULARLY DOMESTIC CARRIERS, EXPERIENCED LOSSES IN 2004 NEGATIVELY IMPACTING NEW ORDERS FOR JETLINERS. OUR LAUNCH BUSINESS REMAINED ON AIR FORCE SUSPENSION AND WE DID NOT CONCLUDE A CONTRACT FOR SUPPLYING TANKERS TO THE U.S. AIR

FORCE (USAF).

MANAGEMENT RESPONDED TO THE CHALLENGES BY RELENTLESSLY

FOCUSING ON EXECUTION OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY AND INTRODUCING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. DURING 2004, WE SUCCESSFULLY LAUNCHED THE 787 WITH UNPRECEDENTED CUSTOMER INTEREST AND THE 747 SPECIAL FREIGHTER AND BEGAN OFFERING THE 777 FREIGHTER.

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES DELIVERED 285 PLANES AS COMPARED TO 281 IN 2003 AND CAPTURED 272 NET ORDERS, UP 14% FROM 2003. IDS POSTED A RECORD YEAR IN 2004 BY DELIVERING DOUBLE-DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH AND EXCELLENT PROFITABILITY. BCC MORE THAN DOUBLED ITS

PRE-TAX INCOME WHILE CONNEXION BY BOEING

SM

LAUNCHED ITS FIRST COMMERCIAL SERVICES IN 2004.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

REVENUES

THE INCREASE IN 2004 CONSOLIDATED REVENUES WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG GROWTH AT IDS AS ITS DEFENSE AND INTELLIGENCE BUSINESSES CONTINUED TO PERFORM IN THE HEALTHY

MARKETS. IDS REVENUES GREW ON INCREASED AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES; INCREASED ACTIVITY IN FUTURE COMBAT SYSTEMS (FCS), MISSILE DEFENSE, INTELLIGENCE, AIRBORNE COMMAND AND CONTROL PROGRAMS; AND SIGNIFICANT INCREASES IN SUPPLY CHAIN SERVICES, LIFE-CYCLE

CUSTOMER SUPPORT, AND TRAINING SYSTEM AND SERVICES. DESPITE INCREASED NEW AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES, COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES REVENUES DECLINED IN 2004. THE DECLINE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DELIVERY MIX AS MORE SINGLE-AISLE AIRCRAFT AND FEWER TWIN-AISLE

AIRCRAFT WERE DELIVERED IN 2004. BCC REVENUES WERE DOWN SLIGHTLY IN 2004 DUE TO LOWER NEW BUSINESS VOLUME. (FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES, IDS AND BCC REVENUES, SEE PAGES 29,41 AND 50.)

LOWER CONSOLIDATED REVENUES IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED

DELIVERIES OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES. THE REDUCED DELIVERIES WERE THE RESULT OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRYS REDUCED NEED FOR ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT AND INCREASED MARKET SHARE OF AIRBUS. THE 2003 OVERALL DECREASE IN COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE REVENUES

WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STRONG PERFORMANCE BY IDS AND BCC. IDS POSTED REVENUE GROWTH ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS DRIVEN BY INCREASED DELIVERIES OF JOINT DIRECT ATTACK MUNITIONS (JDAM); INCREASED VOLUME IN HOMELAND SECURITY, SPARES AND MAINTENANCE, AND

PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS; AND THE START UP OF FCS.

OPERATING EARNINGS

OUR 2004 OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED SHARPLY PRIMARILY DUE TO THE SOLID PERFORMANCE

BY IDS. IDS EARNINGS WERE DRIVEN BY INCREASED REVENUE BASE AND IMPROVED PROFITABILITY ACROSS ALL SEGMENTS. (FOR DETAILED DISCUSSION OF IDS OPERATING EARNINGS PLEASE REFER TO IDS RESULTS OF OPERATION AND FINANCIAL CONDITION BEGINNING ON PAGE 41.)

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED SLIGHTLY AS MARGIN IMPROVEMENTS AND IMPROVED PERIOD COST PERFORMANCE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE NEGATIVE IMPACT OF THE CHANGE IN THE MODEL MIX AND INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE 787 PROGRAM. (SEE PAGE 30 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES OPERATING EARNINGS.) INCLUDED IN 2004 RESULTS IS A CHARGE OF $555 MILLION RELATED TO THE USAF 767 TANKER PROGRAM AND EXPENSES INCURRED TO END PRODUCTION

OF THE 717 AIRCRAFT. $475 MILLION OF THE CHARGE WAS RECORDED BY OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT, WHILE $80 MILLION WAS RECORDED BY IDS (SEE PAGES 31 AND 38 FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION OF THE CHARGE). OTHER SIGNIFICANT FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE 2004

OPERATING EARNINGS COMPARED TO 2003 INCLUDE HIGHER SHARE-BASED PLANS EXPENSES, INCREASE IN BCC OPERATING EARNINGS, AND HIGHER PENSION EXPENSE. THE INCREASE IN THE SHARE-BASED PLANS EXPENSE IN 2004 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO VESTED AND UNDISTRIBUTED

PERFORMANCE SHARES. (SEE NOTE 17.) FOR INFORMATION ON BCC OPERATING EARNINGS PLEASE REFER TO PAGE 51. PENSION EXPENSE IS DISCUSSED ON PAGE 15.

LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 REFLECT LOWER PLANNED COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DELIVERIES, CHARGES RELATED TO THE DECISION TO END PRODUCTION OF THE 757

PROGRAM, GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES, CHARGES RELATED TO THE SATELLITE AND LAUNCH BUSINESSES, LOWER PENSION INCOME, AND AN INCREASE IN OTHER EXPENSES, AS DESCRIBED BELOW. WE DELIVERED 100 FEWER COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002, AND

RECOGNIZED A $184 MILLION CHARGE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DECISION TO END PRODUCTION OF THE 757 PROGRAM. WE ALSO RECOGNIZED $913 MILLION IN GOODWILL CHARGES AS A RESULT OF A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS TRIGGERED BY THE REORGANIZATION OF OUR MILITARY

AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS AND SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENTS INTO IDS; $572 MILLION RECORDED AT IDS AND $341 MILLION RECORDED AT THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT. 2003 OPERATING EARNINGS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A $1,030 MILLION CHARGE

RELATED TO THE SATELLITE AND LAUNCH BUSINESSES (SEE PAGE 46 FOR DETAILS OF THE CHARGE). WE EXPERIENCED LOWER PENSION INCOME DUE TO DECLINING INTEREST RATES AND NEGATIVE PENSION ASSET RETURNS IN 2001 AND 2002, THE IMPACT OF WHICH IS AMORTIZED INTO

EARNINGS IN FUTURE PERIODS. WE ALSO INCURRED HIGHER ESTIMATED ENVIRONMENTAL CLEANUP COSTS, INCREASED WORKERS COMPENSATION CLAIMS, AND INCREASED LEGAL EXPENSE. THESE FACTORS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTINUED

14

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GROWTH AND STRONG OPERATING PERFORMANCE IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF DEFENSE BUSINESSES AND BY CONTINUED IMPROVEMENTS IN OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AT COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES.

WE INCURRED NET PERIODIC PENSION BENEFIT COST OF $451 MILLION IN 2004

COMPARED TO NET PERIODIC PENSION BENEFIT INCOME OF $67 MILLION IN 2003, AND $404 MILLION IN 2002. NOT ALL NET PERIODIC PENSION BENEFIT INCOME OR COST IS RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS IN THE YEAR INCURRED BECAUSE IT IS ALLOCATED TO PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT

COSTS, AND A PORTION REMAINS IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD. ACCORDINGLY, THE OPERATING EARNINGS FOR 2004 INCLUDED $335 MILLION OF PENSION EXPENSE WHILE OPERATING EARNINGS FOR 2003 AND 2002 INCLUDED $147 MILLION AND $526 MILLION OF

PENSION INCOME, RESPECTIVELY.

THE INCREASE IN THE PENSION EXPENSE WAS

PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AMORTIZATIONS OF ACTUARIAL LOSSES EXPERIENCED IN THE LAST FEW YEARS. THE ACTUARIAL LOSSES WERE CREATED BY A COMBINATION OF DECREASING DISCOUNT RATES, WHICH INCREASED THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION, AND NEGATIVE INVESTMENT

EARNINGS IN 2001 AND 2002, WHICH REDUCED THE MARKET RELATED VALUE OF ASSETS. OUR PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT RETURNS OF 13 PERCENT FOR THE PLAN YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004, AND 17 PERCENT FOR THE PLAN YEAR ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2003, REFLECTED STRONG

MARKET AND PLAN ASSET PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER, OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, THE PLAN RETURNS WERE LOWER THAN EXPECTED. BECAUSE WE EXPECT LOW INTEREST RATES TO PERSIST, WE ANTICIPATE OUR PENSION INVESTMENT RETURNS OVER THE LONG TERM TO DECREASE, AS

REFLECTED IN REDUCTION OF THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM ASSET RETURN RATE FROM 9.00 PERCENT IN 2003 TO 8.75 PERCENT IN 2004 AND TO 8.50 PERCENT IN 2005. WE ALSO LOWERED THE DISCOUNT RATE FROM 6.00 PERCENT TO 5.75 PERCENT AS OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2004.

NET EARNINGS

OUR NET EARNINGS INCREASED IN 2004 DUE TO HIGHER OPERATING EARNINGS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER OTHER INCOME AND HIGHER INCOME TAXES.

ADDITIONALLY, INCLUDED IN 2004 EARNINGS IS A $42 MILLION NET GAIN ON BCCS DISPOSAL OF A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF ITS COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS. THE INCREASE IN 2003 NET EARNINGS OVER 2002 REFLECTS THE FEDERAL TAX SETTLEMENT

MENTIONED BELOW, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER OPERATING EARNINGS.

OTHER

INCOME PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF INTEREST INCOME. OTHER INCOME IN 2004 INCLUDES $219 MILLION; OF THIS AMOUNT $154 MILLION RELATED TO INTEREST INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH A SETTLEMENT OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX AUDITS RELATING TO TAX YEARS 1983 THROUGH 1987 AND

$65 MILLION RELATED TO INTEREST ASSOCIATED WITH A SUBSEQUENT SETTLEMENT FOR THE 1986 THROUGH 1997 YEARS. OTHER INCOME IN 2003 INCREASED OVER 2002 MAINLY DUE TO THE RECEIPT OF $397 MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH A $1.1 BILLION PARTIAL

SETTLEMENT OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX AUDITS RELATING TO TAX YEARS 1992 THROUGH 1997. THERE WAS NO SIMILAR INTEREST INCOME IN 2002. ALSO, CONTRIBUTING TO LOWER INCOME IN 2002 WAS $46 MILLION OF LOSSES ON LONG-TERM EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES INVOLVE EXPERIMENTATION, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED TEST ACTIVITIES FOR DEFENSE SYSTEMS, NEW AND DERIVATIVE COMMERCIAL

JET AIRCRAFT, ADVANCE SPACE AND OTHER COMPANY-SPONSORED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THESE EXPENDITURES ARE EITHER CHARGED DIRECTLY AGAINST EARNINGS OR ARE INCLUDED IN AMOUNTS ALLOCABLE AS REIMBURSABLE OVERHEAD COSTS ON U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. IN

ADDITION, BOEING TECHNOLOGY, OUR ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION, FOCUSES ON IMPROVING OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION BY INVESTING IN CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCESSES THAT APPLY TO MULTIPLE BUSINESS UNITS. TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENTS CURRENTLY

BEING PURSUED WITHIN BOEING TECHNOLOGY INCLUDE NETWORK-CENTRIC OPERATIONS, AFFORDABLE STRUCTURES AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY, LEAN AND EFFICIENT DESIGN PROCESSES AND TOOLS, LEAN SUPPORT AND SERVICE INITIATIVES, ADVANCED PLATFORM SYSTEMS AND SAFE

AND CLEAN PRODUCTS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES WERE UP IN 2004 DUE TO INCREASED SPENDING ON THE 787 PROGRAM. THE EXPENSES ARE PRESENTED NET OF PAYMENTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOME SUPPLIERS AS DESCRIBED ON PAGE 34. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE INCREASED IN 2003, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING IDSS CONTINUED FOCUS ON THE 767 GLOBAL TANKER TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT (GTTA) PROGRAM

DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNICATION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURES IN ORDER TO SUPPORT VARIOUS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING FUTURE COMBAT SYSTEMS, JOINT TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEM, FAB-T AND GLOBAL MISSILE. IN 2003, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSES DECREASED AT COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES DUE TO REDUCED SPENDING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 747-400ER. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS FOR EACH OF THE MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND

FINANCIAL CONDITION ON PAGES 33-34 AND 43-47.

INCOME TAXES

THE 2004 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 7.1% DIFFERED FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX

RATE OF 35%, DUE TO FOREIGN SALES CORPORATION (FSC) AND EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME (ETI) EXCLUSION TAX BENEFITS, TAX CREDITS, STATE INCOME TAXES, TAX BENEFITS FROM A SETTLEMENT WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) OF THE YEARS 1986-1997, TAX

BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH STATE TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, AND OTHER PROVISION ADJUSTMENTS.

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATES OF (37.0)% FOR 2003 AND 26.9% FOR 2002 ALSO VARY FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE DUE TO FSC AND ETI BENEFITS, TAX CREDITS, STATE INCOME TAXES, AND IN 2003, FAVORABLE

RESOLUTION OF IRS AUDIT ISSUES AND THE NON-DEDUCTIBILITY FOR TAX PURPOSES OF CERTAIN PORTIONS OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES.

IRS AUDIT OVERVIEW

IRS

EXAMINATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED THROUGH 1997 AND INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN SETTLED WITH THE IRS FOR ALL YEARS THROUGH 1996 AND FOR MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION FOR ALL YEARS THROUGH 1992. WE HAVE FILED APPEALS WITH THE IRS FOR 1993 THROUGH 1997 FOR

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 2004 WE RECEIVED $896 MILLION RELATING TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX REFUNDS FOR WHICH ESTIMATED ACCRUALS HAD

PRIMARILY BEEN RECORDED IN PRIOR PERIODS. OF THIS AMOUNT, $681 MILLION RELATED TO THE 2003 FEDERAL TAX RETURN. $104 MILLION RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT OF THE 1996 TAX YEAR AND THE 1997 PARTIAL TAX YEAR FOR MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION, $69 MILLION

RELATED TO A SETTLEMENT OF THE 1983 THROUGH 1987 TAX YEARS, AND $1 MILLION RELATED TO THE 1985 TAX YEAR. THE BALANCE OF $41 MILLION RELATES TO A PARTIAL SETTLEMENT OF THE 1986 THROUGH 1997 BOEING COMPANY AUDIT AND WAS RECORDED IN THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2004. IN ADDITION, $217 MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH THE TAX REFUNDS WAS RECEIVED AND RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATION. OF THE $217 MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME RECEIVED, $40 MILLION WAS RECORDED IN 2003

AND THE BALANCE WAS RECORDED DURING 2004. IN ADDITION TO THE CASH RECEIVED ABOVE, WE ARE AWAITING THE RECEIPT OF AN ADDITIONAL $124 MILLION OF FEDERAL NET INCOME TAX REFUND AND $42 MILLION OF INTEREST FOR THE SETTLEMENT OF THE YEARS 1986 THROUGH

1997 WHICH HAVE ALREADY BEEN ACCRUED DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004.

LEGISLATIVE UPDATE

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE ACT). THE ACT PROVIDES A DEDUCTION FOR INCOME FROM QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WHICH WILL BE PHASED IN FROM 2005

THROUGH 2010. IN RETURN, THE ACT ALSO PROVIDES FOR A TWO-YEAR PHASE-OUT (EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN PRE-EXISITNG BINDING CONTRACTS) OF THE EXISTING ETI EXCLUSION TAX BENEFIT FOR FOREIGN SALES WHICH THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) RULED WAS AN ILLEGAL

EXPORT SUBSIDY. THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) BELIEVES THAT THE ACT FAILS TO ADEQUATELY REPEAL THE ILLEGAL EXPORT SUBSIDIES BECAUSE OF THE TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND HAS ASKED THE WTO TO REVIEW WHETHER THESE PROVISIONS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR PRIOR

RULING. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHAT IMPACT THIS ISSUE WILL HAVE ON FUTURE EARNINGS PENDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER. ADDITIONALLY, THE ACT CREATES A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. CORPORATIONS TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED INCOME EARNED

ABROAD BY PROVIDING AN 85 PERCENT DIVIDEND RECEIVED DEDUCTION FOR CERTAIN DIVIDENDS FROM CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATIONS.

ON DECEMBER 21, 2004, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD STAFF POSITION (FSP) NO. FAS 109-1,

APPLICATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME

TAXES, TO THE TAX DEDUCTION ON QUALIFIED PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

, WAS ISSUED. FSP NO. FAS 109-1 CLARIFIES THAT THIS TAX DEDUCTION SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A SPECIAL DEDUCTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH

STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

. AS SUCH, THE SPECIAL DEDUCTION HAS NO EFFECT ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES EXISTING AT THE DATE OF ENACTMENT. RATHER, THE IMPACT OF THIS

DEDUCTION WILL BE REPORTED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DEDUCTION IS CLAIMED ON OUR TAX RETURN BEGINNING IN 2005. AS REGULATIONS ARE STILL PENDING, WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO QUANTIFY THIS IMPACT.

ON DECEMBER 21, 2004, FSP NO. FAS 109-2,

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE FOR THE

FOREIGN EARNINGS REPATRIATION PROVISION WITHIN THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004

, WAS ISSUED. FSP NO. FAS 109-2 PROVIDES COMPANIES ADDITIONAL TIME, BEYOND THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PERIOD DURING WHICH THE ACT TOOK EFFECT, TO EVALUATE THE

ACTS IMPACT ON A COMPANYS PLAN FOR REINVESTMENT OR REPATRIATION OF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR PURPOSES OF APPLYING SFAS NO. 109. FSP NO. FAS 109-2 WAS EFFECTIVE UPON ISSUANCE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE HAVE NOT DECIDED ON WHETHER AND

TO WHAT EXTENT WE MIGHT REPATRIATE FOREIGN EARNINGS UNDER THE ACT, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT REFLECT ANY PROVISIONS FOR TAXES ON UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THE ACT, ALTHOUGH NOT YET FINALIZED, IT IS

POSSIBLE THAT UNDER THE REPATRIATION PROVISION OF THE ACT WE MAY REPATRIATE SOME AMOUNT OF EARNINGS BETWEEN $0 TO $350 MILLION WITH THE RESPECTIVE TAX LIABILITY RANGING FROM $0 TO $26 MILLION. WE EXPECT TO BE IN A POSITION TO FINALIZE OUR ASSESSMENT

BY JUNE 30, 2005.

BACKLOG

CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG OF UNFILLED ORDERS EXCLUDES PURCHASE OPTIONS, ANNOUNCED ORDERS FOR

WHICH DEFINITIVE CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED, AND UNOBLIGATED U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT CONTRACT FUNDING. THE INCREASE IN CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG FROM 2003 TO 2004 PRIMARILY RELATES TO NEW ORDERS FOR THE

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

787. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SALES ON MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS THAT WERE AWARDED IN PRIOR PERIODS, PARTICULARY THE C-17 AND F/A-18 PROGRAMS IN A&WS, AND

STRONG SALES ON THE GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE (GMD) PROGRAM AND PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS IN NETWORK SYSTEMS.

THE INCREASE IN CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG FROM 2002 TO 2003 RELATED TO INCREASES IN CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG FOR A&WS AND NETWORK SYSTEMS, OFFSET BY DECREASES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES. A&WS OBTAINED ORDERS

FOR THE APACHE HELICOPTERS FROM GREECE AND KUWAIT, THE F/A-18 E/F MULTI YEAR II CONTRACT AND THE INITIAL FUNDING FOR THE EA-18G FROM THE U.S. NAVY WHILE NETWORK SYSTEMS OBTAINED ORDERS FOR THE GMD PROGRAM AND TURKEY 737 AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING AND

CONTROL (AEW&C) PROGRAMS COUPLED WITH THE INITIAL FUNDING OF THE FCS PROGRAM. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES DECREASE IN CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG REFLECTS THE IMPACT THAT THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN HAS HAD ON THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY.

UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG INCLUDES U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT DEFINITIVE CONTRACTS FOR WHICH

FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN APPROPRIATED. THE DECREASE IN UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG IN 2004 IS MAINLY DUE TO STRONG SALES THROUGHOUT THE IDS SEGMENTS BUT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTRACT AWARDS FOR THE MULTI-MISSION MARITIME AIRCRAFT (MMA) AND FCS PROGRAM

EXTENSION AND AN ORDER FROM DIRECTV FOR 3 SATELLITES.

FOR SEGMENT

REPORTING PURPOSES, WE REPORT COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG FOR AIRPLANES BUILT AND SOLD TO OTHER SEGMENTS. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES RELIEVES CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG UPON THE SALE OF THESE AIRPLANES TO OTHER SEGMENTS.

IDS CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG INCLUDES THE MODIFICATION PERFORMED ON INTRACOMPANY AIRPLANE

PURCHASES FROM COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES. IDS RELIEVES CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG FOR THE MODIFICATION PERFORMED ON AIRPLANES RECEIVED FROM COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES UPON DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER OR AT THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE MILESTONES.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

PRIMARY SOURCES OF OUR LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES INCLUDE CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS AND SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPACITY THROUGH

COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS AND LONG-TERM CAPITAL MARKETS, AS WELL AS UNUSED BORROWING ON REVOLVING CREDIT LINE AGREEMENTS. THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT AFFECT OUR INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS AND LIQUIDITY POSITION, OTHER THAN OPERATING RESULTS ASSOCIATED

WITH CURRENT SALES ACTIVITY, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: TIMING OF NEW AND DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRING BOTH HIGH DEVELOPMENTAL EXPENDITURES AND INITIAL INVENTORY BUILDUP; GROWTH AND CONTRACTIONS IN BUSINESS CYCLES, INCLUDING GROWTH AND EXPANSION

REQUIREMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH REDUCING SALES LEVELS; CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSISTANCE; THE TIMING OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS/REFUNDS AS WELL AS INTEREST AND DIVIDEND PAYMENTS; OUR STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN; INTERNAL INVESTMENTS; AND

POTENTIAL ACQUISITIONS AND DIVESTITURES.

NON-CASH ITEMS

NON-CASH ITEMS IN EARNINGS PRIMARILY INCLUDE DEPRECIATION, AMORTIZATION, SHARE-BASED PLANS

EXPENSE, IMPAIRMENTS, VALUATION PROVISIONS, AND PENSION EXPENSE/INCOME. NON-CASH ITEMS AND CORRESPONDING AMOUNTS ARE LISTED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS.

WORKING CAPITAL

DURING 2004, OUR INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL INCREASED. THIS INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO $4.4 BILLION OF

DISCRETIONARY AND NON-DISCRETIONARY PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS MADE IN 2004 (SEE DISCUSSION FOLLOWING ON PENSIONS). OTHER ITEMS PRIMARILY CONTRIBUTING TO THE NET INCREASE IN INVESTMENT IN WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDE.

·

AN INCREASE IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, DUE TO NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATING CYCLE, PRINCIPALLY IN OUR OTHER OPERATING SEGMENT,

·

A CHANGE IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE RELATED TO THE TAX REFUNDS RECORDED AND TAX EXPENSE RELATED TO CURRENT EARNINGS,

·

CASH USED BY CUSTOMER FINANCING ADDITIONS OF $1,380 MILLION, OFFSET BY CUSTOMER FINANCING COLLECTIONS OF $959 MILLION DUE TO NORMAL CUSTOMER FINANCING ACTIVITIES,

·

AN INCREASE IN ADVANCES IN EXCESS OF RELATED COSTS DUE TO THE RECOVERY OF THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE MARKET,

·

AN INCREASE IN CASH RECEIVED FROM INVENTORIES DUE TO LEAN INITIATIVES.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, WE RECEIVED A FEDERAL INCOME TAX REFUND OF $681 MILLION CASH WHICH RESULTED FROM NET OPERATING AND

CAPITAL LOSS CARRY-BACKS RELATED TO LARGE PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS IN 2003 AND FIRST QUARTER OF 2004.

WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDES CUSTOMER FINANCING TRANSACTIONS PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF NOTES RECEIVABLE, SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES AND OPERATING LEASES. THESE TRANSACTIONS OCCUR AS THE RESULT OF CUSTOMER

RELATED FINANCING ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ITEMS RECORDED IN INVENTORY. THE ORIGINATION AND SUBSEQUENT PRINCIPAL COLLECTIONS FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED AS INVESTING ACTIVITES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS,

CONSISTENT WITH THE PRESENTATION BY BCC IN THEIR STAND ALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE CHANGED THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE CASH FLOW EFFECTS OF CUSTOMER FINANCING TRANSACTIONS BASED ON CONCERNS RAISED BY THE SEC STAFF. THE AMOUNTS FOR PRIOR PERIODS

HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION. (SEE NOTE 26). FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003, AND 2002, THE NET IMPACT ON OPERATING CASH FLOW WAS ($421) MILLION, ($1.3) BILLION, AND ($2.0) BILLION, RESPECTIVELY,

FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING TRANSACTIONS.

PENSIONS

2004 OPERATING CASH

FLOW INCLUDED $4.4 BILLION OF CASH FUNDING TO THE PENSION PLANS. ALMOST ALL OF THE CONTRIBUTIONS WERE VOLUNTARY TO IMPROVE THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR PLANS. ON FEBRUARY 4, 2005, WE CONTRIBUTED $450 MILLION TO THE PENSION PLANS. REQUIRED PENSION

CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) REGULATIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL IN 2005. HOWEVER, WE ARE EVALUATING DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $550 MILLION (PRE-TAX) LATER IN THE YEAR. WE EXPECT TO

CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $17 MILLION TO OUR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS IN 2005.

WE MEASURE OUR PENSION PLANS USING A SEPTEMBER 30 YEAR-END FOR FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING PURPOSES. ALTHOUGH IN 2004 AND 2003, ACTUAL INVESTMENT RETURNS WERE WELL IN EXCESS OF THE EXPECTED RATES OF 8.75% AND 9.0%, RESPECTIVELY, WE

REDUCED OUR EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS BY 25 BASIS POINTS TO 8.5% BEGINNING IN 2005 BECAUSE OF GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS AND CHANGES IN THE PENSION PLAN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO ALLOCATION. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON

PLAN ASSETS IS BASED ON LONG-TERM TARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS OF 50% EQUITY, 31% FIXED INCOME, 6% REAL ESTATE, AND 13% OTHER. CURRENT ALLOCATIONS ARE WITHIN 1 TO 10% OF EACH OF THE LONG-TERM TARGETS. HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES (A KEY FACTOR WHEN

ESTIMATING PLAN LIABILITIES) WHICH HAVE PERSISTED IN 2003 AND 2004, CAUSED US TO RECOGNIZE AN ADDITIONAL NON-CASH CHARGE TO EQUITY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2003. THIS CHARGE, WHICH

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESULTED IN A $358 MILLION INCREASE TO THE ACCRUED PENSION PLAN LIABILITY AND A $226 MILLION AFTER-TAX DECREASE TO THE ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ACCOUNT

WITHIN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, WAS REVERSED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004. THE REVERSAL, WHICH WAS DUE IN LARGE PART TO $4.4 BILLION IN PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS MADE DURING 2004, RESULTED IN A $3.5 BILLION DECREASE TO THE ACCRUED PENSION LIABILITY

AND A $2.2 BILLION AFTER-TAX INCREASE TO THE ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ACCOUNT WITHIN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. THE CHARGES IN 2003 AND REVERSAL IN 2004, DID NOT IMPACT EARNINGS OR CASH FLOW, AND WILL CHANGE IN FUTURE PERIODS AS

INTEREST RATES, MARKET PERFORMANCE, AND PLAN RETURNS VARY FROM EXPECTED ASSUMPTIONS. WE USE A DISCOUNT RATE THAT IS BASED ON A POINT-IN-TIME ESTIMATE AS OF EACH ANNUAL SEPTEMBER 30 MEASUREMENT DATE. ALTHOUGH FUTURE CHANGES TO THE DISCOUNT RATE ARE

UNKNOWN, HAD THE DISCOUNT RATE INCREASED OR DECREASED BY 25 BASIS POINTS, PENSION LIABILITIES IN TOTAL WOULD HAVE DECREASED $1.3 BILLION OR INCREASED $1.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

IN 2004, THE AMOUNT OF CASH USED FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES WAS APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION GREATER THAN IN

2003. A PORTION OF OUR CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN 2004 WAS OFFSET BY CASH OF $2 BILLION GENERATED BY THE SALE OF A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BCCS COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS. ALSO, ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY, PLANT, AND EQUIPMENT

IN 2004 WERE APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION MORE THAN 2003 TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF THE 787 PROGRAM AND GROWTH OF IDS.

DURING 2004, WE INVESTED $3.0 BILLION OF CASH IN AN EXTERNALLY MANAGED PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED INCOME INSTRUMENTS. THE PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND HIGHLY LIQUID AND PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF U.S.

DOLLAR DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES TREASURY, OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, CORPORATIONS, MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES. THE PORTFOLIO HAS AN AVERAGE DURATION OF 1.5 YEARS. SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE DEBT SECURITIES WITH

MATURITIES LESS THAN ONE YEAR AND THE REMAINING SECURITIES ARE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS (EXCEPT CASH EQUIVALENTS WITH MATURITIES LESS THAN 90 DAYS). AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, AMOUNTS INVESTED WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $2.7 BILLION WERE CLASSIFIED AS

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. WE DO NOT INTEND TO HOLD THESE INVESTMENTS TO MATURITY, NOR DO WE INTEND TO ACTIVELY AND FREQUENTLY BUY AND SELL THESE SECURITIES WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF GENERATING

PROFITS ON SHORT-TERM DIFFERENCES IN PRICE. IN ADDITION, AMOUNTS TOTALING $108 MILLION WERE CLASSIFIED AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND $173 MILLION WERE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND RECORDED IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. DURING 2004, REALIZED

GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE INVESTMENTS WERE NOT MATERIAL.

THE MAJORITY OF

BCCS CUSTOMER FINANCING IS FUNDED BY DEBT AND CASH FLOW FROM ITS OWN OPERATION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE HAD OUTSTANDING IRREVOCABLE COMMITMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $6.7 BILLION TO ARRANGE OR PROVIDE FINANCING RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER OR

UNDER OPTION FOR DELIVERIES SCHEDULED THROUGH THE YEAR 2007. NOT ALL OF THESE COMMITMENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE USED; HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE COMMITMENTS ARE WITH PARTIES WITH RELATIVELY LOW CREDIT RATINGS. (SEE NOTES 15 AND 20.)

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

THERE WERE NO DEBT ISSUANCES DURING 2004. IN

2003, WE RECEIVED PROCEEDS OF $1 BILLION RELATED TO OUR SEPTEMBER 13, 2002 SHELF REGISTRATION.

DEBT MATURITIES, WHICH INCLUDE BCC AMOUNTS, WERE $1.1 BILLION IN 2004, $1.8 BILLION IN 2003, AND $1.3 BILLION IN 2002. ADDITIONALLY, BCC ISSUED DEBT IN THE AMOUNT OF $1.0 BILLION IN 2003 AND $2.8 BILLION IN 2002. IN 2003 AND

2002, BCCS DEBT ISSUANCES WERE GENERALLY USED FOR GROWTH IN THE CUSTOMER FINANCING PORTFOLIO.

ON JULY 26, 2004, BCC REDEEMED $1 BILLION FACE VALUE OF ITS OUTSTANDING SENIOR NOTES, WHICH HAD A CARRYING VALUE OF $999 MILLION. THIS REDEMPTION INCLUDED THE ENTIRE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT, EQUAL TO $500 MILLION

FACE VALUE, OF ITS 7.10% SENIOR DEBT SECURITIES DUE 2005 AT A REDEMPTION PRICE EQUAL TO 105.30% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES TOGETHER WITH INTEREST ACCRUED TO THE REDEMPTION DATE. BCC REDEEMED $500 MILLION FACE VALUE OF ITS 5.65% SENIOR DEBT

SECURITIES DUE 2006 AT A REDEMPTION PRICE

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EQUAL TO 104.81% OF THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES TOGETHER WITH INTEREST ACCRUED TO THE REDEMPTION DATE. BCC RECOGNIZED A NET LOSS OF $42 MILLION RELATED TO THIS

EARLY DEBT REDEMPTION. (SEE NOTE 15.)

THERE WERE 14,708,856 SHARES

REPURCHASED AT A PRICE OF $752 MILLION IN OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM, AND 50,657 SHARES REPURCHASED IN A STOCK SWAP IN 2004 AND NO SHARES WERE REPURCHASED IN 2003 OR 2002.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

WE AND BCC EACH HAVE A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM THAT CONTINUES TO SERVE AS A

SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL SOURCE OF SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, NEITHER WE NOR BCC HAD ANY OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUANCES.

WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPACITY. CURRENTLY, $3.4 BILLION REMAINS AVAILABLE TO BCC FROM SHELF REGISTRATIONS FILED WITH THE SEC AND $3.5 BILLION ($2.0 BILLION

EXCLUSIVELY AVAILABLE FOR BCC) OF UNUSED BORROWING ON REVOLVING CREDIT LINE AGREEMENTS WITH A GROUP OF MAJOR BANKS REMAINS AVAILABLE. (SEE NOTE 15). WE BELIEVE OUR INTERNALLY GENERATED LIQUIDITY, TOGETHER WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL CAPITAL RESOURCES,

WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY EXISTING COMMITMENTS AND PLANS, AND ALSO TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF POTENTIAL STRATEGIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD THEY ARISE WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR.

ON MARCH 23, 2004, WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION WITH THE SEC FOR $1 BILLION FOR THE

ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES AND UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK.

IN NOVEMBER

2004, WE ROLLED OVER THE 364-DAY REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITY, REDUCING IT FROM $2.5 BILLION TO $2.0 BILLION. PRIOR TO NOVEMBER WE HAD $1.25 BILLION ASSIGNED TO BCC AND $1.25 BILLION ASSIGNED TO US. CURRENTLY, THERE IS $1.25 BILLION ASSIGNED TO BCC

WITH ONLY $750 MILLION ASSIGNED TO US. THERE WAS NO CHANGE TO THE 5-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY OF $1.5 BILLION, OF WHICH $750 MILLION REMAINS ASSIGNED TO BCC, WE ESTABLISHED IN NOVEMBER 2003.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS FOR THE 364-DAY AND THE 5-YEAR REVOLVING CREDIT FACILITIES.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFITS

PENSION FUNDING IS AN ESTIMATE OF OUR MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS THROUGH 2006 TO PROVIDE PENSION BENEFITS FOR EMPLOYEES BASED ON SERVICE PROVIDED THROUGH 2004 PURSUANT TO THE ERISA REGULATIONS, ALTHOUGH WE MAY MAKE ADDITIONAL

DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS. OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ARE BASED ON BOTH OUR ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS, SINCE THE MAJORITY OF OUR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ARE NOT FUNDED THROUGH A TRUST, AND THE ESTIMATED

CONTRIBUTION TO THE ONE PLAN THAT IS FUNDED THROUGH A TRUST THROUGH 2009. OUR ESTIMATE MAY CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON THE ACTUAL RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS, DISCOUNT RATES, DISCRETIONARY PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS, REGULATORY RULES, AND MEDICAL

TRENDS.

PRODUCTION RELATED

PRODUCTION RELATED PURCHASE

OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE AGREEMENTS FOR PRODUCTION GOODS, TOOLING COSTS, ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS CONTRACTS, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS PRODUCTION RELATED OBLIGATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OBLIGATION RELATES TO INVENTORY

PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS THAT SPECIFY DETERMINABLE PRICES AND QUANTITIES, AND LONG-TERM DELIVERY TIMEFRAMES. THESE AGREEMENTS REQUIRE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO BE PREPARED TO

BUILD AND DELIVER ITEMS IN SUFFICIENT TIME TO MEET OUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULES. THE NEED FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS ARISES DUE TO THE EXTENDED PRODUCTION PLANNING HORIZON FOR MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT,

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND OTHER PRODUCTS WHERE DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER OCCURS OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE INVENTORY COMMITMENTS ARE EITHER SUPPORTED BY FIRM CONTRACTS FROM

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CUSTOMERS, OR HAVE HISTORICALLY RESULTED IN SETTLEMENT THROUGH EITHER TERMINATION PAYMENTS OR CONTRACT ADJUSTMENTS SHOULD THE CUSTOMER BASE NOT MATERIALIZE TO SUPPORT

DELIVERY FROM THE SUPPLIER. SOME INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS MAY INCLUDE ESCALATION ADJUSTMENTS. IN THESE LIMITED CASES, WE HAVE INCLUDED OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECT OF THE ESCALATION ADJUSTMENT IN THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO

VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES TO EFFECT ECONOMIC FLOW BACK AND/OR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO THEIR BUSINESSES OR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, AS THE RESULT OF THEIR PROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND/OR SERVICES

FROM US. THESE COMMITMENTS MAY BE SATISFIED BY OUR PLACEMENT OF DIRECT WORK, PLACEMENT OF VENDOR ORDERS FOR SUPPLIES, OPPORTUNITIES TO BID ON SUPPLY CONTRACTS, TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY, OR OTHER FORMS OF ASSISTANCE TO THE FOREIGN COUNTRY. HOWEVER, IN

CERTAIN CASES, OUR COMMITMENTS MAY BE SATISFIED THROUGH OTHER PARTIES (SUCH AS OUR VENDORS) WHO PURCHASE SUPPLIES FROM OUR FOREIGN CUSTOMERS. WE DO NOT COMMIT TO INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS UNLESS A CONTRACT FOR SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES IS SIGNED. IN CERTAIN CASES, PENALTIES COULD BE IMPOSED IF WE DO NOT MEET OUR INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS. DURING 2004, WE INCURRED NO SUCH PENALTIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE HAVE OUTSTANDING INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS

TOTALING $7.4 BILLION THAT EXTEND THROUGH 2015. IN CASES WHERE WE SATISFY OUR COMMITMENTS THROUGH THE PURCHASE OF SUPPLIES AND THE CRITERIA DESCRIBED IN PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS IS MET, AMOUNTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. TO BE ELIGIBLE

FOR SUCH A PURCHASE ORDER COMMITMENT FROM US, THE FOREIGN COUNTRY OR CUSTOMER MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPABILITY AND CAPACITY AND MUST BE COMPETITIVE IN COST, QUALITY AND SCHEDULE.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS RECORDED ON THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS RECORDED ON THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION PRIMARILY INCLUDE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND CERTAIN OTHER LIABILITIES

AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNING A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF NEW AIRCRAFT (SALE AIRCRAFT), WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SPECIFIED-PRICE TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WITH

CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO TRADE IN USED AIRCRAFT FOR THE PURCHASE OF SALE AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS WHEREIN WE AGREE TO REPURCHASE THE SALE AIRCRAFT AT A

SPECIFIED PRICE AT A FUTURE POINT IN TIME, GENERALLY TEN YEARS AFTER DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT. OUR REPURCHASE OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT IS CONTINGENT UPON A FUTURE, MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT. IF, IN THE

FUTURE, WE EXECUTE AN AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT, AND IF THE CUSTOMER EXERCISES ITS RIGHT TO SELL THE SALE AIRCRAFT TO US, A CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENT WOULD BECOME A TRADE-IN COMMITMENT. CONTINGENT REPURCHASE

COMMITMENTS AND TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS ARE NOW INCLUDED IN OUR GUARANTEES DISCUSSION BASED ON OUR CURRENT ANALYSIS OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS. BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, WE BELIEVE THAT VERY FEW, IF ANY, OF OUR OUTSTANDING CONTINGENT

REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS. DURING 2004, WE RECORDED NO EXPENSE AND MADE NO NET CASH PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS.

EXPOSURE RELATED TO THE TRADE-IN OF USED AIRCRAFT RESULTING FROM TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS MAY TAKE THE FORM OF: (1) ADJUSTMENTS TO REVENUE

RELATED TO THE SALE OF NEW AIRCRAFT DETERMINED AT THE SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT, AND/OR (2) CHARGES TO COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RELATED TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT THAT OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO SIGNING OF A

DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR NEW AIRCRAFT BUT PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE OF THE USED TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT. THE TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT EXPOSURE INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE TABLES ABOVE IS RELATED TO ITEM (2) ABOVE.

THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF

TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS. THE PROBABILITY THAT TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WILL BE EXERCISED IS DETERMINED BY USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION FROM VALUATION SOURCES AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES AND IS CONTINUALLY ASSESSED BY MANAGEMENT.

AS DISCLOSED IN THE ABOVE TABLE, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WERE $972 MILLION AND $1.3 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003. BASED ON THE BEST MARKET INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, IT WAS PROBABLE THAT WE WOULD BE

OBLIGATED TO PERFORM ON TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WITH GROSS AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO CUSTOMERS TOTALING $116 MILLION AND $582 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT RELATED TO PROBABLE CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN

COMMITMENTS WAS $91 MILLION AND $517 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDED $25 MILLION AND $65 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, WHICH REPRESENTS THE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE TRADE-IN

COMMITMENTS.

WE HAVE ISSUED VARIOUS ASSET-RELATED GUARANTEES,

PRINCIPALLY TO FACILITATE THE SALE OF CERTAIN COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO A GUARANTEED PARTY IN THE EVENT THE RELATED AIRCRAFT FAIR VALUES FALL BELOW A SPECIFIED AMOUNT AT A FUTURE POINT IN

TIME. NO AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED WITH THESE TYPES OF GUARANTEES IN SEVERAL YEARS. DURING 2004, WE RECORDED NO EXPENSE AND MADE NO NET CASH PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR ASSET-RELATED GUARANTEES.

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY ISSUED CREDIT GUARANTEES TO CREDITORS OF THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE, OF WHICH WE ARE A 40% PARTNER,

TO ASSIST THE VENTURE IN OBTAINING FINANCING. IN THE EVENT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ON THESE GUARANTEES, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECOVER A PORTION OF THE LOSS FROM OTHER VENTURE PARTNERS AND HAVE COLLATERAL RIGHTS TO CERTAIN ASSETS OF THE VENTURE.

IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ISSUED OTHER CREDIT GUARANTEES TO FACILITATE THE

SALE OF CERTAIN COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO A GUARANTEED PARTY IN THE EVENT THAT LEASE OR LOAN PAYMENTS ARE NOT MADE BY THE ORIGINAL DEBTOR OR LESSEE. OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CREDIT-RELATED

GUARANTEES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY THE UNDERLYING COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THESE GUARANTEES HAVE BEEN EXTENDED ON BEHALF OF ORIGINAL DEBTORS OR LESSEES WITH LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. RECENT FINANCIAL WEAKNESS IN CERTAIN

AIRLINES FURTHER EXPOSES US TO LOSS UNDER OUR CREDIT GUARANTEES. DURING 2004, WE RECORDED EXPENSE OF $1 MILLION AND MADE NO NET CASH PAYMENTS RELATED TO OUR CREDIT GUARANTEES.

WE HAD CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS TO INVESTORS IN THE TRUSTS AS A LIQUIDITY PROVIDER FOR EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES (ETC) PASS-THROUGH

ARRANGEMENTS, WHICH REQUIRED FUNDING TO THE TRUST TO COVER INTEREST DUE TO SUCH INVESTORS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY UNITED AIRLINES, INC. (UNITED). IN THE EVENT OF FUNDING, WE ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A FIRST PRIORITY POSITION IN THE ETC COLLATERAL

IN THE AMOUNT OF THE FUNDING. ON FEBRUARY 7, 2003, WE ADVANCED $101 MILLION TO THE TRUST PERFECTING OUR COLLATERAL POSITION AND TERMINATING OUR LIQUIDITY OBLIGATION. ON AUGUST 9, 2004, THE BANK OF NEW YORK, ACTING AS THE COLLATERAL AGENT, REIMBURSED

US FOR THIS ADVANCE WITH A TOTAL PAYMENT OF $107 MILLION. THE PAYMENT INCLUDED THE ORIGINAL ADVANCED AMOUNT, AS WELL AS INTEREST INCOME RELATED TO THE ADVANCE.

ALSO RELATING TO AN ETC INVESTMENT, WE HAVE POTENTIAL OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO SHORTFALL INTEREST PAYMENTS IN THE EVENT THAT THE INTEREST RATES IN THE UNDERLYING

AGREEMENTS ARE RESET BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL. THESE OBLIGATIONS WOULD CEASE IF UNITED WERE TO DEFAULT ON OUR INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE TRUST. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS MADE BY US DURING 2004.

WE HAVE OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH JOINT VENTURE

INVESTMENTS. PURSUANT TO THESE GUARANTEES, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS IN THE EVENT A THIRD-PARTY FAILS TO PERFORM SPECIFIED SERVICES. WE HAVE MADE NO SIGNIFICANT PAYMENTS IN RELATION TO THESE PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES.

MATERIAL VARIABLE INTERESTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED

ENTITIES

OUR INVESTMENTS IN

ETCS, ENHANCED EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES (EETCS) AND SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) ARE INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF REVISED INTERPRETATION NO. 46 (FIN 46 (R)),

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

. ALL ENTITIES THAT WERE REQUIRED TO

BE CONSOLIDATED UNDER FIN 46(R) HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY CONSOLIDATED, AND THEREFORE, THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46(R) HAD NO IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FROM 1999 THROUGH 2004, WE INVESTED IN ETCS AND EETCS, WHICH ARE TRUSTS THAT PASSIVELY HOLD DEBT INVESTMENTS FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF

AIRCRAFT TO ENHANCE LIQUIDITY FOR INVESTORS, WHO IN TURN PASS THIS LIQUIDITY BENEFIT DIRECTLY TO AIRLINES IN THE FORM OF LOWER COUPON AND/OR GREATER DEBT CAPACITY. ETCS AND EETCS PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH TRANCHED RIGHTS TO CASH FLOWS FROM A FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENT, AS WELL AS A COLLATERAL POSITION IN THE RELATED ASSET. OUR INVESTMENT IN ETCS AND EETCS DO NOT REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION UNDER FIN 46(R). WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO ECONOMIC LOSS FROM ETCS AND EETCS IS $349 MILLION, COMPRISED OF

OUR $321 MILLION INVESTMENT BALANCE AND A MAXIMUM POTENTIAL EXPOSURE OF $28 MILLION RELATING TO POTENTIAL SHORTFALL INTEREST PAYMENTS. ACCOUNTING LOSSES, IF ANY, FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD COULD DIFFER. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE ETC AND EETC

TRANSACTIONS WE PARTICIPATED IN HAD TOTAL ASSETS OF $3.9 BILLION AND TOTAL DEBT (WHICH IS NON-RECOURSE TO US) OF $3.6 BILLION. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE RECORDED REVENUES OF $28 MILLION AND CASH FLOWS OF $70 MILLION.

FROM 1998 THROUGH 2004, WE PROVIDED SUBORDINATED LOANS TO CERTAIN SPES THAT ARE

UTILIZED BY THE AIRLINES, LENDERS AND LOAN GUARANTORS, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES. ALL OF THESE SPES ARE INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF FIN 46(R); HOWEVER, ONLY CERTAIN SPES REQUIRE

25

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSOLIDATION. SPE ARRANGEMENTS ARE UTILIZED TO ISOLATE INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTIONS FOR LEGAL LIABILITY OR TAX PURPOSES, OR TO PERFECT SECURITY INTERESTS FROM OUR

PERSPECTIVE, AS WELL AS, IN SOME CASES, THAT OF A THIRD-PARTY LENDER IN CERTAIN LEVERAGED LEASE TRANSACTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO ECONOMIC LOSS FROM NON-CONSOLIDATED SPE ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIE) IS

$43 MILLION, WHICH REPRESENTS OUR INVESTMENT BALANCE. ACCOUNTING LOSSES, IF ANY, FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD COULD DIFFER. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THESE SPE ARRANGEMENTS HAD TOTAL ASSETS OF $451 MILLION AND TOTAL DEBT (WHICH IS NON-RECOURSE TO US) OF

$408 MILLION. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE RECORDED REVENUES OF $3 MILLION AND CASH FLOWS OF $28 MILLION.

INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS

WE UTILIZE INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS (IRB) ISSUED BY THE CITY OF WICHITA TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE AND/OR CONSTRUCTION OF REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY AT OUR WICHITA SITE. TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH IRBS INCLUDE

A PROVISION FOR A TEN-YEAR PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT AND A SALES TAX EXEMPTION FROM THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE. WE RECORD THE PROPERTY ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION, ALONG WITH CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION TO REPAY THE PROCEEDS

OF THE IRB. WE HAVE ALSO PURCHASED THE IRBS AND THEREFORE WE ARE THE BONDHOLDER AS WELL AS THE BORROWER/ LESSEE OF THE PROPERTY PURCHASED WITH THE IRB PROCEEDS.

WE ALSO HAVE A SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT IN PLACE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AUTHORITY OF FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA WHERE WE ARE BOTH BORROWER AND BONDHOLDER. TAX BENEFITS

ASSOCIATED WITH THESE IRBS ARE THE PROVISION OF A TEN-YEAR PARTIAL PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT.

THE CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION AND IRB ASSET ARE RECORDED NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION PURSUANT TO FIN 39,

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

AIRLINE INDUSTRY

ENVIRONMENT

WORLD-WIDE AIR TRAVEL EXPERIENCED A STRONG REBOUND IN 2004. THIS REBOUND IS NOTABLE IN THAT IT REPRESENTS A RECOVERY FROM THE LEVELS OF 2003 WHICH WERE DEPRESSED BY THE

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

SEVERE ACUTE RESPIRATORY SYNDROME (SARS) OUTBREAK IN ASIA, AND REPRESENTS A TRAFFIC LEVEL THAT EXCEEDS THE PREVIOUS RECORD WHICH WAS SET IN 2000. IT HAS TAKEN THE

INDUSTRY FOUR YEARS TO EXCEED THAT LEVEL, INDICATING THE DIFFICULTIES FACED BY THE WORLDS AIRLINES AS THEY HAVE DEALT WITH THE EFFECTS OF RECESSION, TERRORISM, AND DISEASE. THIS TRAFFIC VOLUME HAS BEEN DRIVEN BY STRONG WORLD-WIDE ECONOMIC

GROWTH WHICH STIMULATES DEMAND, AND DECLINING REAL AIRLINE YIELDS WHICH MAKES AIR TRAVEL MORE AFFORDABLE TO MORE PEOPLE.

THIS INCREASE IN DEMAND HAS PRODUCED HIGH LOAD FACTORS, BUT NOT INDUSTRY-WIDE PROFITABILITY DUE TO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN THE PRICE OF JET FUEL. THE WORLDS

AIRLINES HAVE MADE GREAT STRIDES IN COST EFFICIENCY, ONLY TO SEE THOSE IMPROVEMENTS BE MORE THAN OFFSET BY PRICE INCREASES OF JET FUEL. THE WORLD-WIDE INCREASES IN THE PRICE OF CRUDE OIL THAT BEGAN IN MID 2003 AND PEAKED IN LATE 2004 HAVE

CONTRIBUTED TO WORLD AIRLINE LOSSES THAT ARE ESTIMATED TO BE ABOUT $5 BILLION DOLLARS IN 2004 AND REPRESENT THE FOURTH CONSECUTIVE YEAR OF LOSSES FOR THE WORLDS AIRLINES.

THIS LARGE INDUSTRY LOSS DOES NOT MEAN THAT ALL AIRLINES ARE LOSING MONEY IN THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT. WE ARE SEEING DIVERGENCE IN THE

PROFITABILITY OF DIFFERENT TYPES OF AIRLINES AS THEIR DIFFERENT BUSINESS MODELS ARE PROVING TO BE VULNERABLE OR ROBUST TO THESE ENVIRONMENTAL CHANGES. THE HARDEST-HIT HAVE BEEN THE LARGE U.S. NETWORK CARRIERS. THESE AIRLINES WERE THE MOST DAMAGED BY

THE RESULTS OF THE 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS ON THE UNITED STATES AND HAVE BEEN THE MOST VULNERABLE TO INCREASING COMPETITION AND TECHNOLOGY CHANGES THAT ARE CHANGING THE AIR TRAVEL BUSINESS. THE LARGE NETWORK AIRLINES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE

BEEN MORE SUCCESSFUL IN DEALING WITH THE CHALLENGES OF 2004, MOST ARE PROFITABLE DESPITE CURRENT FUEL PRICES, AND THEY CONTINUE TO ORDER NEW AIRPLANES. THE AIRLINES THAT HAVE FARED BEST ARE THE LOW-COST, LOW-FARE AIRLINES. THEY HAVE BEEN

CONSISTENTLY PROFITABLE THROUGHOUT THE CURRENT CHALLENGES AND THEIR CONTINUED GROWTH REPRESENTS A REAL CHANGE IN THE AIR TRAVEL MARKET. THESE AIRLINES ALSO CONTINUE TO ORDER AND TO TAKE DELIVERY OF NEW AIRPLANES.

FURTHER RECOVERY IN PROFITABILITY FOR THE WORLDS AIRLINES IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON

THE FUTURE MOVEMENT IN OIL AND FUEL PRICES; AS THESE PRICES FALL THE PROSPECTS OF THE WORLDS AIRLINES WILL IMPROVE. AS PROFITABILITY IMPROVES AND AIR TRAVEL DEMAND CONTINUES TO INCREASE WITH INCREASING ECONOMIC ACTIVITY, WE SEE AN IMPROVEMENT

IN THE PROSPECTS FOR FUTURE AIRPLANE ORDERS AND DELIVERIES.

OUR 20-YEAR

FORECAST OF THE AVERAGE LONG-TERM GROWTH RATE OF PASSENGER TRAFFIC IS 5.2% PER ANNUM, AND 6.2% PER ANNUM FOR CARGO TRAFFIC BASED ON PROJECTED AVERAGE ANNUAL WORLDWIDE REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH OF 3.0%. BASED ON GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH PROJECTIONS OVER THE

LONG TERM, AND TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, INCREASING UTILIZATION LEVELS OF THE WORLDWIDE AIRPLANE FLEET AND REQUIREMENTS TO REPLACE OLDER AIRPLANES, WE PROJECT A $2.0 TRILLION MARKET FOR 25,000 NEW AIRPLANES

OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS. THIS IS A LONG-TERM FORECAST; HISTORICALLY, WHILE FACTORS SUCH AS THE GULF WAR AND INCREASED TICKET CHARGES FOR SECURITY HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OVER THE SPAN OF SEVERAL YEARS, THEY HAVE NOT DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED THE

LONGER-TERM TRENDS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY, AND THEREFORE, OUR MARKET OUTLOOK.

INHERENT BUSINESS RISKS

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT ARE NORMALLY SOLD ON A FIRM FIXED-PRICE BASIS WITH AN INDEXED PRICE ESCALATION CLAUSE. OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER JET AIRCRAFT ON SCHEDULE IS DEPENDENT UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING

EXECUTION OF INTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS, AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AND REGULATORY CERTIFICATION. THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND MAJOR DERIVATIVES INVOLVES INCREASED RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND CERTIFICATION SCHEDULES.

THE WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT IS PREDOMINATELY DRIVEN BY LONG-TERM TRENDS IN AIRLINE PASSENGER TRAFFIC. THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS UNDERLYING LONG-TERM TRAFFIC GROWTH ARE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH, BOTH IN DEVELOPED AND

EMERGING COUNTRIES AND POLITICAL STABILITY. DEMAND FOR OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS FURTHER INFLUENCED BY AIRLINE INDUSTRY PROFITABILITY, WORLD TRADE POLICIES, GOVERNMENT-TO-

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED UPON AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, AND PRICE AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS

THE COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT MARKET AND THE AIRLINE

INDUSTRY REMAIN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT THE EXISTING LONG-TERM DOWNWARD TREND IN PASSENGER REVENUE YIELDS WORLDWIDE (MEASURED IN REAL TERMS) TO CONTINUE INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. MARKET LIBERALIZATION IN EUROPE AND ASIA HAS CONTINUED TO

ENABLE LOW-COST AIRLINES TO GAIN MARKET SHARE. THESE AIRLINES HAVE INCREASED THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON AIRFARES. THIS RESULTS IN CONTINUED COST PRESSURES FOR ALL AIRLINES AND PRICE PRESSURE ON OUR PRODUCTS. MAJOR PRODUCTIVITY GAINS ARE ESSENTIAL TO

ENSURE A FAVORABLE MARKET POSITION AT ACCEPTABLE PROFIT MARGINS.

CONTINUED ACCESS TO GLOBAL MARKETS REMAINS VITAL TO OUR ABILITY TO FULLY REALIZE OUR SALES POTENTIAL AND LONG-TERM INVESTMENT RETURNS. APPROXIMATELY 2/3 OF COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES THIRD-PARTY SALES AND CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG ARE FROM

CUSTOMERS BASED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

WE FACE AGGRESSIVE

INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS THAT ARE INTENT ON INCREASING THEIR MARKET SHARE. THEY OFFER COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND HAVE ACCESS TO MOST OF THE SAME CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. AIRBUS HAS HISTORICALLY INVESTED HEAVILY TO CREATE A FAMILY OF PRODUCTS TO

COMPETE WITH OURS. REGIONAL JET MAKERS EMBRAER AND BOMBARDIER, COMING FROM THE LESS THAN 100-SEAT COMMERCIAL JET MARKET, CONTINUE TO DEVELOP LARGER AND MORE CAPABLE AIRPLANES. THIS MARKET ENVIRONMENT HAS RESULTED IN INTENSE PRESSURES ON PRICING AND

OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

WORLDWIDE, AIRPLANE SALES ARE GENERALLY

CONDUCTED IN U.S. DOLLARS. FLUCTUATING EXCHANGE RATES AFFECT THE PROFIT POTENTIAL OF OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS, ALL OF WHOM HAVE SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN OTHER CURRENCIES. THE RECENT DECLINE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO THEIR LOCAL CURRENCIES IS PUTTING

UNUSUAL PRESSURE ON THEIR FUTURE REVENUES AND PROFITS. WHILE THIS MAY SEEM LIKE AN ADVANTAGE TO US, IT CONTAINS A POTENTIAL THREAT IN THAT COMPETITORS MAY REACT BY AGGRESSIVELY REDUCING COSTS, POTENTIALLY IMPROVING THEIR LONGER-TERM COMPETITIVE

POSTURE. AIRBUS HAS INDICATED THAT THEY ARE ADOPTING THIS APPROACH, AND PLAN MORE THAN 10% REDUCTION IN COSTS BY 2006. IF THE DOLLAR STRENGTHENS BY THEN, AIRBUS COULD USE THE EXTRA EFFICIENCY TO GAIN MARKET SHARE AND DEVELOP NEW PRODUCTS.

WE ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OUR PROCESSES AND CONTINUING COST-REDUCTION

EFFORTS. WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE OUR EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES NETWORK FOR AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO PROVIDE A HIGHER LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND PRODUCTIVITY. THESE EFFORTS ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE PRICING STRATEGIES

THAT ENABLE US TO PRICE COMPETITIVELY AND MAINTAIN SATISFACTORY MARGINS. WHILE WE ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OUR PROCESSES AND CONTINUING COST REDUCTION ACTIVITIES, EVENTS MAY OCCUR THAT WILL PREVENT US FROM ACHIEVING PLANNED RESULTS.

WE CONTINUE TO EXPLORE STRATEGIC OPTIONS RELATED TO OUR OPERATIONS AT VARIOUS SITES TO

FOCUS ON LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION, WHICH IS WHERE WE ARE MOST COMPETITIVE AND CAN ADD THE MOST VALUE TO OUR AIRPLANES AND SERVICES. THESE SITES INCLUDE BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO WICHITA, TULSA AND MCALESTER. (SEE NOTE 27.)

SUMMARY

AIR TRAVEL CONTINUES TO BE THE SAFEST, MOST COST-EFFECTIVE FORM OF

TRAVEL EVER INVENTED. MODERN AIR TRAVEL IS ESSENTIAL TO WORLD-WIDE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT, CONTRIBUTING TO, AND BENEFITING FROM INCREASING GLOBAL TRADE. RECENT SIGNS OF RECOVERY AND THE CONTINUED EXPECTATION FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH IN AIR TRAVEL ARE

ENCOURAGING. THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY CONTINUES TO EVOLVE IN A CHALLENGING ENVIRONMENT. SUCCESSFUL AIRLINES WITH ROBUST BUSINESS MODELS ARE CONTINUING TO GROW AND WILL NEED NEW AIRPLANES TO ACCOMMODATE THAT GROWTH AS WELL AS TO MAINTAIN MODERN,

COST-EFFECTIVE FLEETS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AS WELL, PROVIDING AIRPLANES AND SERVICES THAT ARE RECOGNIZED AS PROVIDING THE MOST CAPABLE AND PRODUCTIVE SOLUTIONS TO THE AIRLINES BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS.

REVENUES

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES REVENUE IS DERIVED PRIMARILY FROM COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT

DELIVERIES. NEW COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES WERE HIGHER IN 2004 COMPARED TO 2003, BUT THE DELIVERY MIX INCLUDED MORE SINGLE-AISLE AIRCRAFT AND FEWER TWIN-AISLE AIRCRAFT. THE DECLINE IN REVENUE OF $1.4 BILLION IN 2004 FROM 2003 WAS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO NEW AIRPLANE MODEL MIX OF $1.2 BILLION AND NET REDUCTION OF $132 MILLION IN OTHER PRODUCTS.

THE DECLINE IN REVENUE IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE DECLINE IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION MARKET WHICH RESULTED IN FEWER COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES.

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, INCLUDING DELIVERIES UNDER

FIRM ORDERS REPRESENT NEW AIRCRAFT PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WHERE THE CUSTOMERS RIGHTS TO CANCEL WITHOUT PENALTY HAVE EXPIRED. TYPICAL CUSTOMER RIGHTS TO CANCEL WITHOUT

PENALTY INCLUDE THE CUSTOMER RECEIVING APPROVAL FROM ITS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS, GOVERNMENT AND COMPLETING FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. ALL SUCH CANCELLATION RIGHTS MUST BE SATISFIED OR EXPIRED EVEN IF SATISFYING SUCH CONDITIONS ARE HIGHLY

CERTAIN. FIRM ORDERS EXCLUDE OPTION AIRCRAFT AND AIRCRAFT SUBJECT TO RECONFIRMATION.

OPERATING EARNINGS

THE INCREASE OF $46 MILLION IN OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2004 FROM 2003 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO $466 MILLION FROM IMPROVED PROGRAM MARGINS DUE TO COST REDUCTION INITIATIVES AND

DECREASED PERIOD COSTS OFFSET BY LOWER EARNINGS FROM THE CHANGE IN MODEL MIX OF $205 MILLION, 717 PROGRAM TERMINATION CHARGE OF $280 MILLION, 767 USAF TANKER PROGRAM CHARGE OF $195 MILLION AND INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE OF $265

MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, IN 2003 WE HAD A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $341 MILLION AND A CHARGE OF $184 MILLION RESULTING FROM THE DECISION TO END PRODUCTION OF THE 757 PROGRAM.

THE DECLINE IN OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN REVENUE AS A RESULT OF LOWER DELIVERY

VOLUME, A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $341 MILLION, A $184 MILLION CHARGE RESULTING FROM THE DECISION TO END PRODUCTION OF THE 757 PROGRAM, AND INCREASED PENSION EXPENSE, ALL OF WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY IMPROVED OPERATING EFFICIENCY AND

REDUCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE.

BACKLOG

CONTRACTUAL

BACKLOG OF UNFILLED ORDERS EXCLUDES PURCHASE OPTIONS, ANNOUNCED ORDERS FOR WHICH DEFINITIVE CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED, AND UNOBLIGATED U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT CONTRACT FUNDING. THE INCREASE IN BACKLOG IN 2004 COMPARED TO 2003 PRIMARILY

RELATES TO NEW ORDERS FOR THE 777 AND 787. THE DECLINE IN BACKLOG IN 2003 COMPARED TO 2002 REPRESENTS HIGHER DELIVERY VOLUME ON ALL AIRPLANE PROGRAMS RELATIVE TO NEW ORDERS.

UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $0.6 BILLION FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004. THIS INCREASE IS ATTRIBUTED

TO THE MMA PROGRAM CONTRACT AWARD. THERE WAS NO UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003. FOR EACH AIRPLANE PROGRAM, WE ESTIMATE THE QUANTITY OF AIRPLANES THAT WILL BE PRODUCED FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. WE REFER TO

THIS ESTIMATE AS THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH PROGRAM IS A KEY DETERMINANT OF GROSS MARGINS WE RECOGNIZE ON SALES OF INDIVIDUAL AIRPLANES THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF A PROGRAM. SEE APPLICATION OF CRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIES-PROGRAM ACCOUNTING. ESTIMATION OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH PROGRAM TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SEVERAL FACTORS THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF THE DEMAND FOR THE PARTICULAR PROGRAM, SUCH AS FIRM ORDERS, LETTERS OF INTENT FROM

PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS, AND MARKET STUDIES. WE REVIEW AND REASSESS OUR PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITIES ON A QUARTERLY BASIS IN COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT PROGRAM ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION COSTS INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS, A PORTION OF WHICH DO NOT VARY WITH

PRODUCTION RATES. AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME NEEDED TO PRODUCE THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY INCREASES, THE AVERAGE COST OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY ALSO INCREASES AS THESE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL COST ESTIMATES, THUS REDUCING THE GROSS

MARGIN AND RELATED EARNINGS PROVIDED OTHER FACTORS DO NOT CHANGE.

717 PROGRAM

THE

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 717 PROGRAM HAS BEEN BASED ON FIRM ORDERS SINCE THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001. THE 717 PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY WAS INCREASED DURING 2004 DUE TO THE PROGRAM OBTAINING ADDITIONAL FIRM ORDERS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, OF

THE 18 REMAINING UNDELIVERED UNITS, 8 UNITS WILL BE DELIVERED TO A SINGLE CUSTOMER WITH UNCERTAIN FINANCIAL CONDITION. AS A RESULT, ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS, THESE AIRCRAFT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS LONG-TERM OPERATING LEASES AS THEY ARE DELIVERED. THE

VALUE OF THE INVENTORY FOR THE UNDELIVERED AIRCRAFT AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, REMAINED REALIZABLE.

PROGRAM CONTINUITY AT THE END OF THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004 WAS DEPENDENT ON THE OUTCOME OF CURRENT SALES CAMPAIGNS. DURING THE NINE MONTHS ENDED SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 FIRM ORDERS FOR SIX ADDITIONAL UNITS HAD

BEEN RECEIVED AND DURING NOVEMBER 2004, FIRM ORDERS FOR TWO ADDITIONAL UNITS HAD BEEN RECEIVED.

ON JANUARY 12, 2005, WE DECIDED TO CONCLUDE PRODUCTION OF THE 717 COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE IN 2006 DUE TO THE LACK OF OVERALL MARKET DEMAND FOR THE AIRPLANE. THE DECISION IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN TOTAL PRE-TAX

CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $385 MILLION, OF WHICH $280 MILLION IS INCORPORATED IN THE 2004 FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END RESULTS.

OF THE $280 MILLION CHARGE THAT WAS INCORPORATED IN THE 2004 FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END RESULTS, SUPPLIER TERMINATION CHARGES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $171 MILLION;

PRODUCTION DISRUPTION AND RELATED CHARGES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $36 MILLION; PENSION/POST-RETIREMENT CURTAILMENT CHARGES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $43 MILLION; AND SEVERANCE CHARGES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $30 MILLION. OF THE $105 MILLION CHARGE THAT IS

EXPECTED TO BE RECORDED IN PERIODS SUBSEQUENT TO 2004, PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $60 MILLION AND PLANT SHUTDOWN CHARGES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $45 MILLION. THE TERMINATION OF THE 717 LINE WILL RESULT IN $385 MILLION OF CASH

EXPENDITURES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR DURING 2005 THROUGH 2007. THIS CHARGE IS DETERMINED BASED ON CURRENT FACTS AND INFORMATION AND WE WILL REVISE OUR ESTIMATES ACCORDINGLY AS NEW FACTS AND INFORMATION BECOME AVAILABLE.

737 NEXT-GENERATION AND 777 PROGRAM

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 737

NEXT-GENERATION AND 777 PROGRAMS WERE INCREASED DURING 2004 AS A RESULT OF THE PROGRAMS NORMAL PROGRESSION OF OBTAINING ADDITIONAL ORDERS AND DELIVERING AIRCRAFT.

747 PROGRAM

THE 747 PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY WAS INCREASED DURING 2004 AS A RESULT OF ADDITIONAL ORDERS RECEIVED SINCE 2003.

WE ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR THE COMMERCIAL MARKET FOR THE 747 AND POTENTIAL NEW DERIVATIVES. THE FUTURE OF THE PROGRAM LARGELY DEPENDS ON MARKET ACCEPTANCE OF NEW DERIVATIVES. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE MARKET ACCEPTANCE, COMPLETION OF

PRODUCTION IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE. A FORWARD LOSS IS NOT EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF A DECISION TO COMPLETE PRODUCTION BUT PROGRAM MARGINS WOULD BE MODESTLY IMPACTED. ADDITIONALLY, COMPLETION OF PRODUCTION MAY CREATE EXCESS SPARES INVENTORY, RESULTING

IN A CHARGE THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL. A DECISION TO PROCEED WITH A NEW DERIVATIVE OR COMPLETE PRODUCTION IS LIKELY TO BE MADE MID-YEAR 2005.

757 PROGRAM

DUE TO LACK OF DEMAND FOR THE 757 PROGRAM, A DECISION WAS MADE IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003 TO END PRODUCTION OF THE PROGRAM. PRODUCTION OF THE

757 PROGRAM ENDED IN OCTOBER 2004. THERE ARE TWO REMAINING AIRCRAFT THAT WILL BE DELIVERED IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2005.

31

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN 2003, THE 757 PROGRAM CHARGE OF $184 MILLION INCLUDED $15 MILLION OF SPARES INVENTORY WRITEDOWN AND $169 MILLION

FORWARD LOSS. THE FORWARD LOSS WAS COMPRISED OF $111 MILLION IN VENDOR TERMINATION CHARGES AND $58 MILLION DUE TO THE REQUIREMENT TO ALLOCATE INCURRED INVENTORY COSTS OVER A REDUCED QUANTITY OF 757 AIRPLANE DELIVERIES. OTHER THAN AN ESTIMATED $17

MILLION OF TOOLING DISPOSITION AND PLANT CLEAN-UP COSTS, WHICH WILL BE EXPENSED AS INCURRED, NO FUTURE CHARGES RELATED TO THE 757 AIRPLANE PROGRAM ARE EXPECTED. HOWEVER, WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE TOTAL ESTIMATED COST OF SALES AND TOTAL

ESTIMATED REVENUES FOR THE REMAINING PROGRAM, AND WILL REVISE OUR ESTIMATES ACCORDINGLY AS NEW FACTS AND INFORMATION BECOME AVAILABLE.

767 PROGRAM

BASED ON THE REGULAR QUARTER AND YEAR-END REVIEWS, OUR UPDATED ASSESSMENT OF SECURING THE SPECIFIC USAF 767 TANKER CONTRACT RESULTED IN THE

DECISION THAT THE PRE-CONTRACT COSTS SHOULD NO LONGER BE DEFERRED, GIVEN THE CONTINUED DELAY AND NOW LIKELY RECOMPETITION OF THE CONTRACT. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES PORTION OF THE CHARGE WAS $195 MILLION CONSISTING OF $125 MILLION OF INCURRED

DEVELOPMENT AND TOOLING COSTS, $54 MILLION OF SPENDING, NET OF SCRAP VALUE, FOR PRODUCTION OF A PARTIALLY COMPLETE USAF TANKER, AND $16 MILLION OF SUPPLIER TERMINATION LIABILITY.

THE DECREASE IN THE 767 PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY DURING 2004 WAS DUE TO THE REMOVAL OF ANTICIPATED FUTURE 767 TANKER DELIVERIES TO

THE USAF. THE LONG TERM VIABILITY OF THE 767 PROGRAM IS DEPENDENT ON RECEIVING A TIMELY USAF TANKER CONTRACT. WE WILL BE CLOSELY MONITORING THE FUTURE MARKET FOR THE 767. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY, PRODUCTION COMPLETION IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE. A

FORWARD LOSS IS NOT EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF THIS DECISION BUT PROGRAM MARGINS WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED. ADDITIONALLY, COMPLETION OF PRODUCTION MAY CREATE EXCESS SPARES INVENTORY, RESULTING IN A CHARGE THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL. A

DECISION TO COMPLETE PRODUCTION IS LIKELY TO BE MADE MID-YEAR 2005. WE CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY MARKET THE 767 PROGRAM TO COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AND POSITION THE PROGRAM TO SUPPORT A USAF 767 TANKER CONTRACT AND OTHER MILITARY APPLICATIONS. (SEE IDS 767

TANKER PROGRAM ON PAGE 38 FOR FURTHER DISCUSSION.)

THE ACCOUNTING

QUANTITY FOR EACH PROGRAM MAY INCLUDE UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED, UNDELIVERED UNITS UNDER CONTRACT, AND UNITS ANTICIPATED TO BE UNDER CONTRACT IN THE FUTURE (ANTICIPATED ORDERS). IN DEVELOPING TOTAL PROGRAM ESTIMATES ALL OF THESE ITEMS WITHIN

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY MUST BE ADDRESSED. THE PERCENTAGE OF ANTICIPATED ORDERS INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AS COMPARED TO THE NUMBER OF CUMULATIVE FIRM ORDERS* AS OF DECEMBER 31 WERE AS FOLLOWS.

FLEET SUPPORT

WE PROVIDE THE OPERATORS OF ALL OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE MODELS

ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES TO FACILITATE EFFICIENT AND SAFE AIRCRAFT OPERATION. COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS FLEET SUPPORT SERVICES, THESE ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES INCLUDE FLIGHT AND MAINTENANCE TRAINING, FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT COSTS, ENGINEERING SERVICES AND

TECHNICAL DATA AND DOCUMENTS. FLEET SUPPORT ACTIVITY BEGINS PRIOR TO AIRCRAFT DELIVERY AS THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES TRAINING, MANUALS AND TECHNICAL CONSULTING SUPPORT, AND CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE OPERATIONAL LIFE OF THE AIRCRAFT. SERVICES PROVIDED

AFTER DELIVERY INCLUDE FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT, CONSULTING ON MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES BROUGHT FORTH BY THE CUSTOMER OR REGULATORS, UPDATING MANUALS AND ENGINEERING DATA, AND THE ISSUANCE OF SERVICE BULLETINS THAT IMPACT THE ENTIRE

MODELS FLEET. FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT INVOLVES OUR PERSONNEL LOCATED AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES PROVIDING AND COORDINATING FLEET SUPPORT ACTIVITIES AND REQUESTS. THE COSTS FOR FLEET SUPPORT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY LESS

THAN 1.5% OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED COSTS OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THIS LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES IS ANTICIPATED TO CONTINUE IN THE UPCOMING YEARS. THESE COSTS DO NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY WITH CURRENT PRODUCTION RATES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WE CONTINUALLY EVALUATE OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE

CURRENT AIRCRAFT MODELS, AND ASSESS THE MARKETPLACE TO ENSURE THAT OUR FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT IS WELL POSITIONED TO MEET FUTURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. THE FUNDAMENTAL STRATEGY IS TO MAINTAIN A BROAD PRODUCT LINE THAT IS

RESPONSIVE TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS BY MAXIMIZING COMMONALITY AMONG OUR FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, WE ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BY OFFERING PRODUCTS WITH THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF

QUALITY, SAFETY, TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE, ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND IN-SERVICE SUPPORT.

THE INCREASE IN 2004 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COMPARED TO 2003 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SPENDING ON THE 787. THE DECREASE IN 2003 RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COMPARED TO 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO REDUCED SPENDING ON THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE 747-400ER. THE INITIAL DELIVERY OF THE 747-400ER AND THE ROLLOUT OF THE FIRST 777-300ER OCCURRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002. THE INITIAL DELIVERY OF THE 777-300ER OCCURRED DURING THE FIRST HALF OF 2004.

WE ARE CURRENTLY FOCUSING OUR NEW AIRPLANE PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON THE 787

PROGRAM, WHICH WITH THE THREE PLANNED VERSIONS WILL SEAT 223 TO 296 PASSENGERS IN MULTIPLE CLASS CONFIGURATIONS. IN EARLY 2004, WE RECEIVED THE INITIAL LAUNCH ORDER FOR THE 787 AND BOARD OF DIRECTORS (BOD) APPROVAL TO PROCEED WITH FULL DEVELOPMENT

AND PRODUCTION. ENTRY INTO SERVICE IS TARGETED FOR 2008. WE PROJECT A CONTINUED INCREASE IN OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SPENDING IN 2005, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY SPENDING ON THE 787 WHILE WE ALSO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP DERIVATIVES AND FEATURES FOR OUR

OTHER PROGRAMS PRIMARILY THE

DEFERRED AS PART OF THE CONTRACT COSTS AND IS NOT REFLECTED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

DURING 2004, WE ESTABLISHED COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOME SUPPLIERS FOR THE 787 THAT WILL ENHANCE OUR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES AND OFFSET A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL RISK OF DEVELOPING THE 787 PRODUCT.

AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM THESE SUPPLIERS WILL REDUCE OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE RELATED TO THE 787, SINCE WE WILL HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO REFUND ANY AMOUNTS EARNED PER THE ARRANGEMENTS REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. OUR

COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS EXPLICITLY STATE THAT THE SUPPLIER CONTRIBUTIONS ARE FOR REIMBURSEMENTS OF COSTS WE INCUR FOR EXPERIMENTATION, BASIC DESIGN AND TESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 787. IN EACH ARRANGEMENT, WE WILL RETAIN THE

SAME RIGHTS THAT HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE UNDER TRADITIONAL SUPPLIER ARRANGEMENTS ON PAST AIRPLANE PROGRAMS. FOR 2004, 787 SUPPLIER DEVELOPMENT COST SHARING PAYMENTS EARNED WERE $205 MILLION.

INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

IDS IS COMPRISED OF FOUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE A&WS, NETWORK SYSTEMS, SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND L&OS. THE IDS BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT EXTENDS OVER MULTIPLE MARKETS, INCLUDING DEFENSE (A&WS, NETWORK SYSTEMS AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS SEGMENTS), HOMELAND SECURITY (NETWORK SYSTEMS), CIVIL SPACE TRANSPORTATION AND EXPLORATION (L&OS), AND LAUNCH AND SATELLITES (L&OS).

IDS DERIVES OVER 85% OF ITS REVENUE FROM SALES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND WE ARE FORECASTING THIS BUSINESS MIX WILL REMAIN AT THIS LEVEL INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. SPECIFICALLY, THE PRIMARY CUSTOMERS OF IDS ARE THE DOD FOR OUR PRODUCTS IN THE

DEFENSE MARKET, THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY FOR THE HOMELAND SECURITY MARKET, NASA FOR THE CIVIL SPACE TRANSPORTATION AND EXPLORATION MARKET, AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND COMMERCIAL SATELLITE SERVICE PROVIDERS FOR THE LAUNCH AND

SATELLITE MARKET. SINCE THE TRENDS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE MARKETS IMPACT IDS OPPORTUNITIES AND RISKS IN UNIQUE WAYS, THE VARIOUS ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS FOR EACH ARE DISCUSSED INDIVIDUALLY BELOW.

DEFENSE ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

THE U.S. DOD REPRESENTS NEARLY 50% OF THE

WORLDS DEFENSE BUDGET. THE CURRENT DEFENSE ENVIRONMENT IS CHARACTERIZED BY TRANSFORMATION AND CHANGE IN THE FACE OF SHRINKING FORCE STRUCTURE, AGING PLATFORMS, AND LEVELS OF OPERATIONS AND ENGAGEMENTS WORLDWIDE THAT ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGH

FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT IS ALSO HEAVILY INFLUENCED BY THE CONTINUING WAR ON TERRORISM AND THE NEED TO BRING NEW TECHNOLOGIES TO ASSIST THE WAR FIGHTER. THE UNITED STATES LEADERSHIP IN THE GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM

DEMONSTRATES THE VALUE OF

34

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NETWORKED INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE AND COMMUNICATIONS, INTEROPERABILITY ACROSS PLATFORMS, SERVICES AND FORCES, AND THE LEVERAGING EFFECTS OF PRECISE, PERSISTENT, AND

SELECTIVE ENGAGEMENT. THE SIGNIFICANCE AND ADVANTAGE OF UNMANNED SYSTEMS TO PERFORM MANY OF THESE TASKS IS GROWING. THESE EXPERIENCES ARE DRIVING THE DOD, ALONG WITH MILITARIES WORLDWIDE, TO TRANSFORM THEIR FORCES AND THE WAY THEY OPERATE.

NETWORK-CENTRIC OPERATIONS ARE AT THE HEART OF THIS TRANSFORMATION. THERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE PRESSURE BETWEEN THIS TRANSFORMATION GOAL AND THE SUPPORT REQUIRED FOR THE EXISTING FORCES.

THE 2005 DOD AUTHORIZATION WAS APPROVED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 AT A TOTAL LEVEL OF $402 BILLION, INCLUDING SUPPLEMENTALS.

SUPPLEMENTALS ARE THE ADDITIONAL FUNDS THAT ARE REQUESTED BY THE DOD TO COVER EXTRAORDINARY EVENTS THAT WERE NOT PLANNED FOR IN THE USUAL BUDGET CYCLE. ALTHOUGH UNDER PRESSURE, THE DOD BUDGET REMAINS STRONG AND FOCUSED ON TRANSFORMATION. THIS WILL

PROVIDE OPPORTUNITIES FOR IDS PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE. HOWEVER, WITH A STRUGGLING GLOBAL ECONOMY AND ANTICIPATED FEDERAL BUDGET DEFICITS, ALLOCATIONS TO DOD PROCUREMENT DECREASED BETWEEN FISCAL YEAR 2004 AND 2005, AND WILL REMAIN UNDER PRESSURE IN

THE NEAR FUTURE. THIS SUGGESTS THAT THE DOD WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY STRATEGIES EMPHASIZING NETWORK-CENTRIC OPERATIONS, JOINT INTEROPERABILITY, LONG-RANGE STRIKE, UNMANNED AIR COMBAT AND RECONNAISSANCE VEHICLES, PRECISION GUIDED

WEAPONS AND CONTINUED PRIVATIZATION OF LOGISTICS AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS WHILE MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER COSTS. ALONG WITH THIS, WE ARE ALREADY SEEING THE NEED FOR THE MILITARY TO MAKE DIFFICULT CHOICES

BETWEEN PROGRAMS IN AN EFFORT TO SUPPORT THEIR HIGHEST PRIORITY. PROGRAMS WILL BE CONTINUALLY EVALUATED WITH PROGRAM PERFORMANCE AND RELEVANCY TO THE OVERALL DOD VISION AS THE MEASURES FOR CONTINUATION OR CANCELLATION.

MILITARY TRANSFORMATION

THE DEFENSE TRANSFORMATION IS EVIDENCED BY A

TREND TOWARD SMALLER, MORE CAPABLE, INTEROPERABLE, AND TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED FORCES. TO ACHIEVE THESE CAPABILITIES, A TRANSFORMATION IN ACQUISITION IS UNDERWAY WITH AN INCREASING TREND TOWARD EARLY DEPLOYMENT OF INITIAL PROGRAM CAPABILITIES

FOLLOWED BY SUBSEQUENT INCREMENTAL IMPROVEMENTS (REFERRED TO AS SPIRAL DEVELOPMENT), COOPERATIVE INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND A DEMONSTRATED WILLINGNESS TO EXPLORE NEW FORMS OF DEVELOPMENT, ACQUISITION AND SUPPORT. ALONG WITH THESE TRENDS,

NEW SYSTEM PROCUREMENTS ARE BEING EVALUATED FOR THE DEGREE TO WHICH THEY SUPPORT THE CONCEPT OF JOINTNESS AND INTEROPER-ABILITY AMONG THE SERVICES.

INSTITUTIONS AND EVENTS CONTINUE TO SHAPE THE DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT. THE DODS IMPLEMENTATION OF A NEW JOINT CAPABILITIES INTEGRATION AND DEVELOPMENT

SYSTEMS ORGANIZATION AND PROCESS, ALONG WITH REVISIONS TO THE DEFENSE ACQUISITION SYSTEM, PROGRAM PLANNING BUDGETING AND EXECUTION PROCESSES AND THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE OFFICE OF FORCE TRANSFORMATION, HAS CREATED A DURABLE INSTITUTIONAL FOUNDATION

FOR CONTINUED TRANSFORMATION. OPERATIONS IN THE CONTINUING GLOBAL WAR ON TERRORISM REAFFIRM THE NEED FOR THE RAPID PROJECTION OF DECISIVE COMBAT POWER AROUND THE WORLD AND EMPHASIZE THE NEED FOR NEW CAPABILITIES AND SOLUTIONS FOR THE WAR FIGHTER.

THEY ALSO HIGHLIGHT THE NEED FOR IMPROVED LOGISTICS AND STABILITY OPERATION CAPABILITIES AT COMPLETION OF HOSTILITIES. TOWARD THAT END, THE DOD IS FULLY COMMITTED TO A TRANSFORMATION THAT WILL ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN ADVANTAGES THROUGH CHANGES IN

OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS, ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE WAR FIGHTING CAPABILITIES.

MISSILE DEFENSE

FUNDING FOR THE MISSILE DEFENSE MARKET IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY (MDA) BUDGET. THE PRIMARY

THRUSTS IN THIS MARKET ARE THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS AND THE GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE (GMD) PROGRAM. THE OVERALL MDA MISSILE DEFENSE BUDGET FOR 2004 WAS APPROXIMATELY $9 BILLION AND

APPROPRIATIONS FOR 2005 ARE ABOUT $10 BILLION. WITH THE ADMINISTRATION TRYING TO CURB THE RISE IN DEFENSE SPENDING IT APPEARS THE MDAS BUDGET WILL BEGIN TO COME UNDER PRESSURE. THAT SAID WE FEEL THE GMD PROGRAM HAS CONTINUED TO MAKE GREAT

PROGRESS OVER THE PAST YEAR IN MEETING PRESIDENT BUSHS CALL TO DEPLOY A CAPABILITY BY THE END OF 2004. WE BELIEVE THIS PROGRAM, WHICH IS THE CORNERSTONE OF OUR MISSILE DEFENSE BUSINESS, WILL BE SUPPORTED. THROUGH OUR LEADERSHIP POSITION ON THE

35

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MISSILE DEFENSE NATIONAL TEAM AND OUR PRIME CONTRACTOR ROLE ON THE GMD SEGMENT PROGRAM AND ON THE AIRBORNE LASER PROGRAM, IDS IS POSITIONED TO MAINTAIN ITS ROLE AS THE

MDAS NUMBER ONE CONTRACTOR.

DEFENSE COMPETITIVE

ENVIRONMENT

THE GLOBAL COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO INTENSIFY, WITH INCREASED FOCUS ON THE U.S. DEFENSE MARKET, THE WORLDS LARGEST AND MOST ATTRACTIVE. IDS FACES STRONG COMPETITION IN ALL MARKET SEGMENTS, PRIMARILY FROM

LOCKHEED MARTIN, NORTHROP GRUMMAN, AND RAYTHEON. FOREIGN COMPANIES SUCH AS BAE SYSTEMS AND EADS CONTINUE TO BUILD A STRATEGIC PRESENCE IN THE U.S. MARKET BY STRENGTHENING THEIR NORTH AMERICAN OPERATIONS AND PARTNERING WITH U.S. DEFENSE COMPANIES.

WE EXPECT INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION, PARTNERING, AND MARKET CONCENTRATION

TO CONTINUE. PRIME CONTRACTORS WILL CONTINUE TO PARTNER OR SERVE AS MAJOR SUPPLIERS TO EACH OTHER ON VARIOUS PROGRAMS AND WILL PERFORM TARGETED ACQUISITIONS TO FILL TECHNOLOGY OR CUSTOMER GAPS. AT THE LOWER TIERS, CONSOLIDATION PERSISTS AND SELECT

COMPANIES HAVE BEEN POSITIONING FOR LARGER ROLES, ESPECIALLY IN THE AEROSPACE SUPPORT MARKET.

HOMELAND SECURITY ENVIRONMENT

THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY BECAME OFFICIAL IN 2003, A YEAR CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT U.S. GOVERNMENT TRANSFORMATIONAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHALLENGES. ORGANIZATIONAL ALIGNMENT IS

ONGOING AND PROCUREMENT PRACTICES ARE EVOLVING. IT IS IMPORTANT TO REALIZE THAT THIS DEPARTMENT HAS BEEN FORMED FROM EXISTING AGENCIES AND THEIR BUDGETS, AND THEREFORE A LARGE PORTION OF THE NEAR-TERM BUDGET IS COMMITTED TO HERITAGE PROGRAMS AND

STAFFING. UNTIL SOME OF THESE EXISTING COMMITMENTS ARE COMPLETE, FUNDING FOR NEW OPPORTUNITIES WILL REPRESENT A SMALL SHARE OF THE OVERALL DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY BUDGET. WE EXPECT HOMELAND SECURITY TO BE A STABLE MARKET WITH MINIMAL GROWTH

AND EMPHASIS BEING PLACED ON INFORMATION ANALYSIS AND INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION.

CONGRESS AND THE ADMINISTRATION APPROPRIATED $33 BILLION TO THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY IN FISCAL YEAR 2005. THIS AMOUNT IS A SLIGHT DECREASE COMPARED TO THE FISCAL YEAR 2004 APPROPRIATIONS OF $29 BILLION, BUT STILL EXHIBITS A

CONTINUED COMMITMENT TO HOMELAND SECURITY. ONLY 50% OF THE FEDERAL SPENDING ON HOMELAND SECURITY IS WITHIN THE NEWLY FORMED DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. OTHER FEDERAL AGENCIES SUCH AS THE DOD STILL HAVE HOMELAND SECURITY AND HOMELAND DEFENSE

FUNDING UNDER THEIR DIRECTION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE OUR EXPERIENCE AS THE SYSTEMS INTEGRATOR ON THE EXPLOSIVE DETECTION SYSTEMS PROGRAM, OUR AVIATION HERITAGE AND OUR INTEGRATED BATTLESPACE AND NETWORK-CENTRIC OPERATIONS EXPERTISE AND

CAPABILITIES INTO THE HOMELAND SECURITY MARKETPLACE.

CIVIL SPACE

TRANSPORTATION AND EXPLORATION ENVIRONMENT

CONGRESS APPROVED VERY CLOSE TO FULL FUNDING OF NASAS FISCAL YEAR 2005 BUDGET REQUEST, INCLUDING NEEDED FUNDS FOR SPACE SHUTTLE RETURN TO FLIGHT, INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, AND NEW INITIATIVES

ASSOCIATED WITH THE VISION FOR SPACE EXPLORATION. NASA FISCAL YEAR 2005 APPROPRIATIONS OF APPROXIMATELY $16 BILLION IS A SLIGHT INCREASE OVER THE FISCAL YEAR 2004 FUNDING LEVEL.

THE ADMINISTRATION RECENTLY RELEASED A NEW SPACE TRANSPORTATION POLICY. THIS DOCUMENT RECOGNIZES THE CRITICAL NEED FOR SPACE SHUTTLE

RETURN TO FLIGHT, REINFORCES THE NATIONS COMMITMENT TO THE VISION FOR SPACE EXPLORATION  INCLUDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CREW EXPLORATION VEHICLE (CEV)  PROVIDES FOR THE EVALUATION OF SHUTTLE-DERIVED SYSTEMS, AND SUPPORTS A VIABLE

SPACE TRANSPORTATION INDUSTRIAL AND TECHNOLOGY BASE. WE BELIEVE NASA WILL REMAIN FOCUSED ON SUPPORTING THIS NEW POLICY EVEN AS THEY TRANSITION TO A NEW ADMINISTRATOR, WHO HAS YET TO BE NAMED. THE NEW VISION FOR SPACE EXPLORATION AND THE PRIORITIES

LAID OUT IN THE NEW SPACE TRANSPORTATION POLICY WILL PROVIDE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDUSTRY TO DEVELOP NEW TECHNOLOGIES AND OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS TO TAKE HUMAN BEINGS BEYOND LOW EARTH ORBIT. IDS, WITH OUR STRONG HERITAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPACE

SYSTEMS AND OUR EXPERTISE IN THE AREA OF HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT, INCLUDING THE SPACE SHUTTLE AND THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, IS WELL POSITIONED TO WORK WITH AND SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMER IN ACCOMPLISHING THEIR GOALS. IDS WILL CONTINUE ITS WORK ON THE

SPACE SHUTTLE AND INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION PROGRAMS ALONG WITH DEVELOPMENT OF CRITICAL TECHNOLOGIES SUCH AS ROCKET PROPULSION AND LIFE SUPPORT SYSTEMS TO PREPARE TO MEET THE CHALLENGE OF RETURNING TO THE MOON AND EXPLORING THE SOLAR SYSTEM.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LAUNCH AND SATELLITE ENVIRONMENT

THE COMMERCIAL SPACE MARKET HAS SOFTENED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE LATE 1990S

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DOWNTURN IN THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. THIS MARKET IS NOW CHARACTERIZED BY OVERCAPACITY, AGGRESSIVE PRICING AND LIMITED NEAR-TERM OPPORTUNITIES. RECENT PROJECTIONS INDICATE THESE MARKET CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST UNTIL THE

END OF THIS DECADE. WE BELIEVE THERE WILL BE LOWER COMMERCIAL SATELLITE ORDERS THROUGH THIS DECADE, ALONG WITH LOWER DEMAND FOR COMMERCIAL LAUNCH SERVICES AS COMPARED TO THE HIGH POINTS OF THE EARLY TO MID-1990S. HOWEVER, THE REPLACEMENT MARKET FOR

SATELLITES WILL DRIVE SOME RECOVERY IN THE SECOND HALF OF THIS DECADE. IN THIS EXTREMELY LIMITED MARKET, WE SEE A GROWING AMOUNT OF OVERCAPACITY, WHICH IN TURN IS DRIVING THE CONTINUED DETERIORATION OF PRICING CONDITIONS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE

PROFITABLE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE OPPORTUNITIES, WHERE THE CUSTOMER VALUES OUR TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND UNIQUE SOLUTIONS, LIKE THE RECENTLY AWARDED ORDER BY DIRECTV. HOWEVER, WE WILL NOT PURSUE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE ORDERS OR LAUNCH CONTRACTS AT A LOSS,

AND GIVEN THE CURRENT PRICING ENVIRONMENT, WE HAVE DECIDED, FOR THE NEAR-TERM, TO FOCUS ON OUR DELTA IV PROGRAM ON THE GOVERNMENT LAUNCH MARKET, WHICH WE BELIEVE IS A MORE STABLE MARKET.

INHERENT BUSINESS RISKS

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED IN MOST OF OUR MARKETS. WE DEAL WITH NUMEROUS U.S. GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES AND ENTITIES, INCLUDING ALL OF THE BRANCHES OF THE U.S. MILITARY, NASA, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. SIMILAR GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES EXIST IN OUR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS, MAY TERMINATE ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS AT THEIR CONVENIENCE AS WELL AS FOR DEFAULT BASED ON OUR FAILURE TO MEET SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS. IF ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WERE TO BE TERMINATED FOR CONVENIENCE (TFC), WE GENERALLY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PAYMENT

FOR WORK COMPLETED AND ALLOWABLE TERMINATION OR CANCELLATION COSTS. IF ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WERE TO BE TERMINATED FOR DEFAULT (TFD), GENERALLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD PAY ONLY FOR THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AND CAN REQUIRE US TO

PAY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT PRICE AND THE COST TO RE-PROCURE THE CONTRACT ITEMS, NET OF THE WORK ACCEPTED FROM THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN ALSO HOLD US LIABLE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE DEFAULT.

ON FEBRUARY 23, 2004, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ANNOUNCED PLANS TO TERMINATE

FOR CONVENIENCE, THE RAH-66 COMANCHE EMD CONTRACT. THE JOINT VENTURE OF BOEING AND SIKORSKY AIRCRAFT (A DIVISION OF UNITED TECHNOLOGIES CORPORATION) HAD A 50/50 SHARE IN PROGRAM WORK SHARE AND EARNINGS. ON MARCH 19, 2004, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ISSUED

A PARTIAL TFC NOTIFICATION. BY MARCH 19, 2005, A TERMINATION PROPOSAL WILL BE SUBMITTED AND NEGOTIATIONS WILL COMMENCE WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT SHORTLY THEREAFTER. THE PROGRAM REPRESENTS LESS THAN 1% OF OUR PROJECTED REVENUES FOR 2005 AND LESS THAN

1% OF OUR REVENUES FOR 2004.

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS ALSO ARE

CONDITIONED UPON THE CONTINUING AVAILABILITY OF CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS. LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND RELATED ORDERS ARE SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION IF APPROPRIATIONS FOR SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE PERIODS BECOME UNAVAILABLE. ON RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS, CONGRESS USUALLY APPROPRIATES FUNDS ON A GOVERNMENT FISCAL YEAR BASIS (SEPTEMBER 30 YEAR-END), EVEN THOUGH CONTRACT PERFORMANCE MAY EXTEND OVER SEVERAL YEARS.

MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS ARE FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS (JUST OVER 50% OF IDS REVENUES ARE GENERATED FROM FIXED-PRICE TYPE CONTRACTS). OF THE

FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS, 40% ARE FIXED-PRICE DELIVERY CONTRACTS AND 10% ARE FIXED-PRICE MILESTONE. WHILE FIRM, FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS ALLOW US TO BENEFIT FROM COST SAVINGS, THEY ALSO EXPOSE US TO THE RISK OF COST OVERRUNS. IF THE INITIAL ESTIMATES WE

USE TO CALCULATE THE CONTRACT PRICE PROVE TO BE INCORRECT, WE CAN INCUR LOSSES ON THOSE CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR CONTRACTS HAVE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS RELATING TO COST CONTROLS, SCHEDULE, AND PRODUCT PERFORMANCE. IF WE FAIL TO MEET THE TERMS

SPECIFIED IN THOSE CONTRACTS, THEN WE MAY NOT REALIZE THEIR FULL BENEFITS. OUR ABILITY TO MANAGE COSTS ON THESE CONTRACTS MAY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. COST OVERRUNS MAY RESULT IN LOWER EARNINGS, WHICH WOULD HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR

FINANCIAL RESULTS.

37

TABLE OF CONTENTS

JUST UNDER 50% OF IDS REVENUES ARE GENERATED FROM COST TYPE CONTRACTS. REVENUES RELATED TO COST TYPE CONTRACTS ARE

RECORDED AS COSTS ARE INCURRED PLUS AN AGREED UPON PROFIT IN RELATION TO THE COSTS INCURRED. COST TYPE CONTRACTS ARE NORMALLY USED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND STUDY TYPE PROGRAMS. COST OVERRUNS ON THESE CONTRACTS USUALLY RESULT IN A LOWER PROFIT TO COST

RATIO. SUFFICIENT NOTIFICATION MUST BE GIVEN TO THE CUSTOMER FOR ANY ANTICIPATED COST GROWTH AND CUSTOMER AUTHORIZATION RECEIVED TO PROCEED IN ORDER TO BE REIMBURSED FOR SAID COSTS.

SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INTERNATIONALLY ARE SUBJECT NOT ONLY TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS AND PROCUREMENT POLICIES AND

PRACTICES BUT ALSO TO THE POLICIES AND APPROVAL OF THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND DOD. THE POLICIES OF SOME INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS REQUIRE INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS, WHICH ARE DISCUSSED MORE FULLY IN THE DISCLOSURES

ABOUT CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS SECTION ON PAGE 22.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO BUSINESS AND COST CLASSIFICATION REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE AND SPACE CONTRACTS. VIOLATIONS CAN RESULT IN CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING FINES, COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE

DAMAGES, RESTITUTION, FORFEITURES, AND SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. WE ARE CONTINUING DISCUSSIONS TOWARDS RESOLUTION WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT REGARDING THE ALLOCATION METHODOLOGY OF PENSION COSTS AND HAVE ASSESSED THE

IMPACT OF POTENTIAL OUTCOMES. BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT, THE MOST PROBABLE OUTCOME OF THIS MATTER IS EXPECTED TO BE IMMATERIAL TO OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND LIQUIDITY. HOWEVER, IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO

PREDICT WHEN RESOLUTION WILL BE REACHED NOR THE FINAL OUTCOME.

767

TANKER PROGRAM

PRIOR TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 WE INCURRED PRE-CONTRACT COSTS RELATED TO DEVELOPMENT COSTS AND ONE IN-PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT. THESE COSTS WERE BEING DEFERRED BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT THAT IT WAS PROBABLE THAT WE WOULD RECOVER

THESE COSTS FROM THE USAF 767 TANKER CONTRACT. THE PRE-CONTRACT COSTS WERE BEING DEFERRED AND RECORDED IN INVENTORY BASED ON AICPA STATEMENT OF POSITION 81-1,

ACCOUNTING FOR PERFORMANCE OF CONSTRUCTION-TYPE AND CERTAIN PRODUCTION-TYPE

CONTRACTS

, WHICH STATES THAT COSTS MAY BE DEFERRED IF THE COSTS CAN BE ASSOCIATED WITH A SPECIFIC ANTICIPATED CONTRACT AND IF THEIR RECOVERABILITY FROM THAT CONTRACT IS PROBABLE. OUR ASSESSMENT OF PROBABILITY WAS BASED ON THE FOLLOWING.

THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT FOR FISCAL

YEAR 2005 PROVIDES $100 MILLION FUNDING FOR TANKER REPLACEMENT. THE NATIONAL DEFENSE AUTHORIZATION ACT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2005 PROVIDES AUTHORIZATION FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF 100 TANKER AIRCRAFT AND ASSOCIATED SUPPORT CONTRACTS. WE BELIEVED, BASED ON OUR

UNDERSTANDING OF THE REQUIREMENTS, THAT OUR 767 AIRCRAFT WAS THE MOST COST EFFECTIVE SOLUTION THAT MEETS THOSE REQUIREMENTS AND IT IS THEREFORE PROBABLE WE WOULD BE AWARDED THE USAF 767 TANKER CONTRACT. BASED ON PRIOR DOD CONTRACTING PRACTICES WE

BELIEVED IT WAS PROBABLE THAT WE WOULD ALSO BE AWARDED THE INITIAL SUPPORT CONTRACTS.

ON JANUARY 14, 2005 WE ANNOUNCED OUR PLAN TO RECOGNIZE PRE-TAX CHARGES TOTALING $275 MILLION RELATED TO THE USAF 767 TANKER PROGRAM. THE CHARGE IS RELATED TO THE INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE AERIAL REFUELING TANKERS FOR THE USAF

AND INCLUDES EXPECTED SUPPLIER OBLIGATIONS. THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT SHARE OF THE CHARGE IS $195 MILLION AND THE IDS SEGMENT SHARE IS $80 MILLION. WITHIN IDS, THE A&WS AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS SEGMENTS WERE IMPACTED BY THE CHARGE. WE USED OUR

OWN MONEY AND RECEIVED NO GOVERNMENT FUNDING IN DEVELOPMENT OF THE USAF 767 TANKER.

THE CHARGE, WHICH IS A RESULT OF OUR REGULAR QUARTER AND YEAR-END REVIEWS, REFLECTS OUR UPDATED ASSESSMENT OF SECURING THE SPECIFIC USAF 767 TANKER CONTRACT THAT WAS BEING NEGOTIATED, GIVEN THE CONTINUED DELAY AND NOW LIKELY

RECOMPETITION OF THE CONTRACT. THIS CHARGE COVERS BOTH INCURRED COST AND ANTICIPATED LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE USAF 767 TANKER PROGRAM.

WE REMAIN FIRMLY COMMITTED TO THE USAF 767 TANKER PROGRAM AND ARE READY TO SUPPORT OUR CUSTOMER IN WHATEVER DECISION IS MADE REGARDING THE RECAPITALIZATION OF THE

NATIONS CURRENT AERIAL REFUELING FLEET.

SEA LAUNCH

THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE, IN WHICH WE ARE A 40% PARTNER, PROVIDES OCEAN-BASED LAUNCH

SERVICES TO COMMERCIAL SATELLITE CUSTOMERS AND IS REPORTED IN THE L&OS SEGMENT. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE VENTURE CONDUCTED TWO SUCCESSFUL LAUNCHES AND A THIRD LAUNCH WHERE THE SATELLITE REACHED AN ORBIT THAT WILL MEET OR EXCEED

ITS EXPECTED LIFE WITH THE AID OF ITS PROPULSION SYSTEM.

WE HAVE ISSUED

CREDIT GUARANTEES TO CREDITORS OF THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE TO ASSIST THE VENTURE IN OBTAINING FINANCING. IN THE EVENT WE ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM ON THESE GUARANTEES, WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECOVER A PORTION OF THE LOSS FROM OTHER VENTURE PARTNERS. WE

BELIEVE OUR TOTAL NET MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS FROM SEA LAUNCH AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 TOTALS $212 MILLION. THE COMPONENTS OF THIS EXPOSURE ARE AS FOLLOWS.

DELTA IV

IN 1999, TWO EMPLOYEES WERE FOUND TO HAVE IN THEIR POSSESSION CERTAIN INFORMATION PERTAINING TO A COMPETITOR, LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION, UNDER THE EVOLVED EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE

(EELV) PROGRAM. THE EMPLOYEES, ONE OF WHOM WAS A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF LOCKHEED MARTIN, WERE TERMINATED AND A THIRD EMPLOYEE WAS DISCIPLINED AND RESIGNED. IN MARCH 2003, THE USAF NOTIFIED US THAT IT WAS REVIEWING OUR PRESENT RESPONSIBILITY AS A

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR IN CONNECTION WITH THE INCIDENT. IN JUNE 2003, LOCKHEED MARTIN FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST US AND THE THREE INDIVIDUAL FORMER EMPLOYEES ARISING FROM THE SAME FACTS. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO PREDICT THE OUTCOME OF THESE

MATTERS OR WHETHER AN ADVERSE OUTCOME WOULD OR COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION. IN ADDITION, ON JULY 24, 2003, THE USAF SUSPENDED CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR SPACE LAUNCH SERVICES BUSINESS AND THE THREE FORMER

EMPLOYEES FROM RECEIVING GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD AS A DIRECT RESULT OF ALLEGED WRONGDOING RELATING TO POSSESSION OF THE LOCKHEED MARTIN INFORMATION DURING THE EELV SOURCE SELECTION IN 1998. THE USAF ALSO TERMINATED 7 OUT OF 21

OF OUR EELV LAUNCHES PREVIOUSLY AWARDED THROUGH A MUTUAL CONTRACT MODIFICATION AND DISQUALIFIED THE LAUNCH SERVICES BUSINESS FROM COMPETING FOR THREE ADDITIONAL LAUNCHES UNDER A FOLLOW-ON PROCUREMENT. THE SAME INCIDENT IS UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE

U.S. ATTORNEY GENERAL IN LOS ANGELES, WHO INDICTED TWO OF THE FORMER EMPLOYEES IN JULY 2003.

THE COST ESTIMATES FOR THE DELTA II AND DELTA IV PROGRAMS ARE BASED, IN PART, UPON ESTIMATED QUANTITIES AND TIMING OF LAUNCH MISSIONS FOR EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS (THE MISSION MANIFEST) TO DETERMINE THE ALLOCATION OF

FIXED COSTS FOR INDIVIDUAL LAUNCHES. REVENUE ESTIMATES INCLUDE PROBABLE PRICE ADJUSTMENTS DUE TO CONTRACTUAL STATEMENT OF WORK CHANGES WHERE WE HAVE ESTABLISHED CONTRACTUAL ENTITLEMENT. THE MISSION MANIFEST REPRESENTS MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE

OF THE LAUNCH SERVICES MARKET, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT ALL KNOWN INFORMATION. DUE TO THE VOLATILITY OF THE GOVERNMENT LAUNCH MARKET, AND THE CURRENT SUSPENSION, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 23, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT CHANGES IN QUANTITY AND

39

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TIMING OF LAUNCHES COULD OCCUR THAT WOULD CHANGE THE MISSION MANIFEST AND THEREFORE THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE DELTA PROGRAMS. THE DELTA II AND IV PROGRAMS ARE

REPORTED IN THE L&OS SEGMENT.

SATELLITES

AS IS THE

STANDARD FOR THE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE INDUSTRY CONTRACTS ARE FIXED PRICE IN NATURE. MANY OF THE EXISTING SATELLITE PROGRAMS HAVE VERY COMPLEX DESIGNS INCLUDING UNIQUE PHASED ARRAY ANTENNA DESIGNS. AS TECHNICAL OR QUALITY ISSUES ARISE, WE HAVE

CONTINUED TO EXPERIENCE SCHEDULE DELAYS AND COST IMPACTS. IF THE ISSUES CONTINUE THEY COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHARGE. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ON-GOING, AND WHILE WE BELIEVE THE COST ESTIMATES REFLECTED IN THE DECEMBER 31, 2004 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE

ADEQUATE AND APPROPRIATE, THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF THE SATELLITES CREATE FINANCIAL RISK, AS ADDITIONAL COMPLETION COSTS MAY BECOME NECESSARY, OR SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES COULD BE MISSED, WHICH COULD TRIGGER TFD PROVISIONS OR OTHER FINANCIALLY

SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE. IN 2004, TWO SATELLITES WERE DELIVERED RETIRING THE TFD RISK ON THOSE SATELLITES. AT THE END OF 2004, WE HAD ONE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE CONTRACT (NSS-8) THAT COULD HAVE EXPOSED US TO THE RISK OF CONTRACT TFD NOTIFICATION. IN

JANUARY 2005, WE ENTERED INTO AN AMENDED AGREEMENT WITH NEW SKIES SATELLITES B.V. WHICH REVISED THE SATELLITES CONTRACTUAL DELIVERY SCHEDULE, PAYMENTS AND OTHER TERMS. AS A RESULT OF THIS AGREEMENT, MANAGEMENT NO LONGER BELIEVES THAT WE HAVE A

MATERIAL RISK OF CONTRACT TFD NOTIFICATION. THE AGREEMENT INCREASES THE FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO THE PERFORMANCE OF THE SATELLITE OVER ITS CONTRACTED ON-ORBIT LIFE. THE ESTIMATED EARNINGS IMPACT OF THIS AGREEMENT HAS BEEN RECOGNIZED IN 2004. OUR

SATELLITE PROGRAMS ARE REPORTED IN EITHER THE NETWORK SYSTEMS OR L&OS SEGMENTS.

ON AUGUST 16, 2004, IN RESPONSE TO A DRAFT DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION FROM ICO GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS (OPERATIONS), LTD. (ICO) SEEKING RETURN OF MONIES PAID BY ICO TO BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. (BSSI) UNDER

CONTRACTS FOR MANUFACTURE AND LAUNCH OF COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES, BSSI FILED A COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AGAINST ICO IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. BSSIS SUIT SEEKS DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT ICOS PRIOR TERMINATION OF THE

CONTRACTS FOR CONVENIENCE EXTINGUISHED ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. ICO FILED A CROSS COMPLAINT WITH THE COURT ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2004, ALLEGING BREACH OF CONTRACT, OTHER CLAIMS, AND SEEKING RECOVERY OF ALL AMOUNTS IT INVESTED IN THE CONTRACTS,

APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT ICOS CLAIMS LACK MERIT AND INTEND TO AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE OUR SUIT AGAINST ICO FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST ICOS CROSS-COMPLAINT.

ON SEPTEMBER 10, 2004, A GROUP OF INSURANCE UNDERWRITERS FOR THURAYA SATELLITE

TELECOMMUNICATIONS (THURAYA) REQUESTED ARBITRATION BEFORE THE INTERNATIONAL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE (ICC), AGAINST BSSI. THE REQUEST FOR ARBITRATION ALLEGES THAT BSSI BREACHED ITS CONTRACT WITH THURAYA FOR SALE OF A 702 SATELLITE WHICH EXPERIENCED

ANOMALIES WITH ITS CONCENTRATOR SOLAR ARRAYS. THE CLAIMANTS SEEK APPROXIMATELY $238 MILLION CONSISTING OF INSURANCE PAYMENTS EITHER ALREADY MADE TO THURAYA OR CURRENTLY IN DISPUTE BETWEEN THURAYA AND ITS INSURERS, AS WELL AS RESERVING THEIR RIGHT TO

INCREASE THE AMOUNT CLAIMED TO $365 MILLION (PLUS CLAIMS OF INTEREST, COSTS, AND FEES), COMPRISING THE TOTAL LOSS ALLEGEDLY INCURRED BY THURAYA. WE BELIEVE THAT THESE CLAIMS LACK MERIT AND INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST THEM. BSSI FILED ITS

ANSWER TO THE ARBITRATION ON DECEMBER 2, 2004 WITH THE ICC.

IN CERTAIN

LAUNCH AND SATELLITE SALES CONTRACTS, WE INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR REPLACEMENT LAUNCH SERVICES OR HARDWARE IF WE DO NOT MEET SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE CRITERIA. WE HAVE HISTORICALLY PURCHASED INSURANCE TO COVER THESE EXPOSURES WHEN ALLOWED UNDER THE TERMS

OF THE CONTRACT. THE CURRENT INSURANCE MARKET REFLECTS UNUSUALLY HIGH PREMIUM RATES AND ALSO SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF CAPACITY TO HANDLE ALL INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. WE MAKE DECISIONS ON THE PROCUREMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF

RISK. THERE IS ONE CONTRACTUAL LAUNCH SCHEDULED IN EARLY 2005 FOR WHICH FULL INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT BE AVAILABLE, OR IF AVAILABLE, COULD BE PROHIBITIVELY EXPENSIVE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO REVIEW THIS RISK. WE ESTIMATE THAT THE POTENTIAL UNINSURED

AMOUNT FOR THIS LAUNCH COULD RANGE BETWEEN $65 MILLION TO $315 MILLION DEPENDING ON THE NATURE OF THE UNINSURED EVENT.

REVENUES

INCREASED

REVENUES FROM 2003 TO 2004 WERE DRIVEN BY THREE SEGMENTS. A&WS REVENUES INCREASED IN TOTAL BY $628 MILLION. THIS INCREASE WAS DUE TO ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES, REMANUFACTURED ROTORCRAFT DELIVERIES AND AMOUNTS RECOGNIZED ON

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE EA-18G GROWLER, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED F-15 AND JDAM VOLUME. NETWORK SYSTEMS REVENUES GREW BY OVER $2 BILLION FROM INCREASED VOLUME IN THE MISSILE DEFENSE AND INTEGRATED BATTLESPACE MARKETS INCLUDING SUCH

PROGRAMS AS GMD, FCS, INTELLIGENCE, AIRBORNE COMMAND AND CONTROL PROGRAMS AND THE RAMP UP OF THE MMA OF $2.3 BILLION. THIS GROWTH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REDUCED HOMELAND SECURITY & SERVICES REVENUE VOLUME. INCREASED VOLUME IN SPARES, TRAINING

SYSTEMS & SERVICES, LIFE CYCLE CUSTOMER SUPPORT (LCCS) AND MODERNIZATION & UPGRADES OF $560 MILLION WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED CONTRACTOR LOGISTICAL SUPPORT & SERVICES (CLSS) IN THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS SEGMENT. L&OS REVENUES

REMAINED CONSTANT WITH INCREASED RETURN TO FLIGHT ACTIVITY IN THE NASA BUSINESSES AND A SATELLITE TFC SETTLEMENT OF $240 MILLION, OFFSET BY DECREASED SATELLITE AND DELTA LAUNCH DELIVERIES AND SATELLITE MILESTONE SLIPS.

INCREASED REVENUES FROM 2002 TO 2003 WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY ADDITIONAL PRODUCTION

AIRCRAFT AND JDAM DELIVERIES AND F/A-22 RAPTOR VOLUME IN A&WS; INCREASED VOLUME IN HOMELAND SECURITY & SERVICES, INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMS AND THE START UP OF FCS IN NETWORK SYSTEMS; INCREASED VOLUME IN SPARES, MAINTENANCE AND LCCS IN SUPPORT

SYSTEMS; AND INCREASED DELTA LAUNCH DELIVERIES IN L&OS.

OPERATING

EARNINGS

THE INCREASE IN OPERATING EARNINGS FROM 2003 TO 2004 REFLECTS STRONG PERFORMANCE FROM THE A&WS, NETWORK SYSTEMS AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS SEGMENTS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOSSES RECORDED IN THE L&OS SEGMENT. OPERATING EARNINGS WERE ALSO

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY $80 MILLION OF CHARGES TAKEN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 RELATED TO THE USAF 767 TANKER PROGRAM.

IN 2004, A&WS EARNINGS WERE DRIVEN BY AN INCREASED REVENUE BASE CONTRIBUTING $82 MILLION FROM THE SEGMENTS MAJOR PRODUCTION PROGRAMS AS A RESULT OF

EFFICIENCIES ACHIEVED THROUGH LEAN INITIATIVES TO REDUCE COSTS BY $210 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE USAF 767 TANKER CHARGE OF $62 MILLION TAKEN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 AND INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT ON THE 767 GTTA

PROGRAM. NETWORK SYSTEMS SEGMENT EARNINGS IMPROVED FROM 2003 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED REVENUES GENERATING ADDITIONAL EARNINGS OF $200 MILLION AND IMPROVED PERFORMANCE FROM THE HOMELAND SECURITY & SERVICES, MILITARY SATELLITE COMMUNICATIONS AND

INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMS OF $147 MILLION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COST GROWTH IN THE MISSILE DEFENSE MARKET. 2003 NETWORK SYSTEMS EARNINGS WERE ALSO IMPACTED BY A $55 MILLION CHARGE RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN A JOINT VENTURE THAT LOST AN IMAGERY CONTRACT

AWARD. SUPPORT SYSTEMS HAD ANOTHER OUTSTANDING YEAR DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN REVENUE THAT GENERATED ADDITIONAL EARNINGS OF $45 MILLION ALONG WITH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE OF $139 MILLION THROUGHOUT THE SEGMENTS BUSINESSES. THE SUPPORT SEGMENT WAS

ALSO IMPACTED BY THE USAF 767 TANKER CHARGE TAKEN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 BY $18 MILLION. L&OS OPERATING EARNINGS IMPROVED FROM 2003 TO 2004 DRIVEN BY THE 2003 CHARGES DESCRIBED IN THE L&OS DISCUSSION. EXCLUDING THE 2003 CHARGES, 2004

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE LOWER DUE TO COST GROWTH FROM TECHNICAL AND QUALITY ISSUES ON SATELLITES CURRENTLY IN THE FACTORY AND WRITE-OFFS OF SLOW MOVING SATELLITE INVENTORY COUPLED WITH DECREASED DELTA IV DELIVERIES IN 2004, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASED USA VENTURE EARNINGS AND INCREASED NASA SYSTEMS SHUTTLE RETURN TO FLIGHT VOLUME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE DECREASED OPERATING EARNINGS FROM 2002 TO 2003 REFLECTS INCREASED OPERATING LOSSES RECORDED FOR THE L&OS

SEGMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STRONG PERFORMANCE FROM THE A&WS, NETWORK SYSTEMS AND SUPPORT SYSTEMS SEGMENTS.

IN 2003, A&WS EARNINGS WERE DRIVEN BY STRONG PERFORMANCE FROM THE SEGMENTS MAJOR PRODUCTION PROGRAMS AND AN INCREASED REVENUE BASE. NETWORK SYSTEMS SEGMENT EARNINGS IMPROVED FROM 2002 PRIMARILY DUE TO

INCREASED REVENUES IN HOMELAND SECURITY & SERVICES, FCS AND PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY COST GROWTH ON MILITARY SATELLITE PROGRAMS AND A CHARGE RELATED TO OUR INVESTMENT IN A JOINT VENTURE. SUPPORT SYSTEMS HAD ANOTHER OUTSTANDING

YEAR DRIVEN BY AN INCREASED REVENUE BASE ALONG WITH IMPROVED PERFORMANCE IN MANY OF THE SEGMENTS BUSINESSES. THE L&OS SEGMENT WAS IMPACTED BY CHARGES THROUGHOUT THE YEAR DESCRIBED IN DETAIL IN THE L&OS SEGMENT DISCUSSION.

BACKLOG

THE DECREASE IN CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG FROM 2003 TO 2004 IS ATTRIBUTED

TO SALES ON MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS THAT WERE AWARDED IN PRIOR PERIODS, PARTICULARLY THE C-17 AND F/A-18 PROGRAMS IN A&WS AND STRONG SALES ON THE GMD PROGRAM AND PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS IN NETWORK SYSTEMS. THE DECREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ORDERS

IN L&OS, SATELLITES AND SHUTTLE RETURN TO FLIGHT AND SHUTTLE CONTRACT EXTENSIONS, AS WELL AS ORDERS IN THE SUPPORT SYSTEMS SEGMENT. IDS TOTAL BACKLOG DECREASED BY 5% FROM 2003 TO 2004 PRIMARILY FROM SALES ON MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS THAT WERE

AWARDED IN PRIOR PERIODS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY CONTRACT AWARDS FOR THE MMA, FCS PROGRAM EXTENSION AND AN ORDER FROM DIRECTV FOR 3 SATELLITES.

OPERATING EARNINGS

A&WS 2004 OPERATING EARNINGS GROWTH REFLECTS INCREASED REVENUES, STRONG PERFORMANCE

ON OUR MAJOR PRODUCTION PROGRAMS RESULTING FROM MANUFACTURING COST OF SALES EFFICIENCIES ACHIEVED THROUGH LEAN INITIATIVES, RISK MITIGATION EFFORTS, AND REDUCTIONS IN PERIOD EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXPANDING BUSINESS BASE. A&WS 2004 RESULTS

WERE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A PRE-TAX CHARGE OF $62 MILLION THAT WAS TAKEN IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 RELATED TO THE USAF 767 TANKER PROGRAM.

A&WS 2003 OPERATING EARNINGS GROWTH REFLECTED INCREASED REVENUES, STRONG PERFORMANCE ON OUR MAJOR PRODUCTION PROGRAMS AND A FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT OF $45 MILLION

ASSOCIATED WITH THE F-15 EAGLE PROGRAM PRE-TAX CHARGES OF $270 MILLION INITIALLY TAKEN IN 1999. THE ADJUSTMENT AMOUNT WAS BASED ON NEGOTIATED TERMINATION LIABILITY WITH SUPPLIERS AND AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES THAT INCORPORATED INVENTORY ASSOCIATED WITH

THE ORIGINAL 1999 CHARGE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

A&WS

SEGMENT CONTINUES TO FOCUS ITS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WHERE IT CAN USE ITS CUSTOMER KNOWLEDGE, TECHNICAL STRENGTH AND LARGE-SCALE INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES TO PROVIDE TRANSFORMATIONAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE WAR FIGHTERS NEEDS. RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES LEVERAGE OUR CAPABILITIES IN ARCHITECTURES, SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND WEAPON SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES ACROSS A BROAD SPECTRUM OF CAPABILITIES DESIGNED TO ENHANCE SITUATIONAL AWARENESS AND SURVIVABILITY; INCREASE MISSION

EFFECTIVENESS AND INTEROPERABILITY AND IMPROVE AFFORDABILITY, RELIABILITY AND ECONOMIC OWNERSHIP. CONTINUED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS IN UNMANNED SYSTEMS HAVE ENABLED THE DEMONSTRATION OF MULTI-VEHICLE COORDINATED FLIGHT AND DISTRIBUTED

CONTROL OF HIGH PERFORMANCE UNMANNED COMBAT AIR VEHICLES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN ADVANCED WEAPONS TECHNOLOGIES EMPHASIZES, AMONG OTHER THINGS, PRECISION GUIDANCE AND MULTI-MODE TARGETING AS EVIDENCED BY OUR SUCCESSFUL SMALL DIAMETER BOMB (SDB)

OFFERING. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS IN THE GTTA PROGRAM REPRESENTS A SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE STATE OF THE ART REFUELING CAPABILITIES TO DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS, DEMONSTRATING THE SYNERGISTIC VALUE OF OUR

DIVERSIFIED COMPANY-WIDE PORTFOLIO. OTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS INCLUDE UPGRADE AND TECHNOLOGY INSERTIONS TO NETWORK-ENABLE AND ENHANCE THE CAPABILITY AND COMPETITIVENESS OF CURRENT PRODUCT LINES SUCH AS THE F/A-18E/F HORNET, F-15E EAGLE,

AH-64 APACHE, CH-47 CHINOOK AND C-17 GLOBEMASTER III.

BACKLOG

A&WS CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG DECREASED FROM 2003 TO 2004 PRIMARILY DUE TO SALES ON MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS THAT WERE AWARDED IN PRIOR PERIODS. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ORDERS ON CHINOOK, T-45, V-22 AND THE JOINT HELMET-MOUNTED CUEING SYSTEM

PROGRAMS.

A&WS INCREASED CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG FROM 2002 TO 2003 IS

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTED TO THE CAPTURE OF SEVERAL KEY AWARDS INCLUDING THE F/A-18 E/F MULTI YEAR II CONTRACT, APACHE HELICOPTER NEW BUILDS, AND THE INITIAL FUNDING FOR THE EA-18G. BACKLOG ALSO INCREASED DUE TO RATE INCREASE ON THE F/A-22 LOW RATE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NETWORK SYSTEMS INCREASED REVENUES FROM 2002 TO 2003 WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE RAMP UP OF THE FCS PROGRAM,

INCREASED ACTIVITY IN INTELLIGENCE AND HOMELAND SECURITY & SERVICES PROGRAMS, AND THE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH OF A NAVAL SATELLITE (UHF F11).

OPERATING EARNINGS

NETWORK SYSTEMS 2004 EARNINGS RESULTS WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED REVENUE STATED ABOVE, IN ADDITION TO IMPROVED PERFORMANCE ON

AIRBORNE COMMAND AND CONTROL, MILITARY SATELLITE COMMUNICATION, INTELLIGENCE PROGRAMS AND CAPTURE OF AWARD FEE EARNINGS ON COST TYPE CONTRACTS. 2003 RESULTS WERE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY A $55 MILLION PRE-TAX NON-CASH CHARGE TAKEN ON RESOURCE 21 (A

JOINT VENTURE WE HAD ENTERED INTO) AS A RESULT OF A DECISION BY NASA TO NOT AWARD AN IMAGERY CONTRACT TO RESOURCE 21.

NETWORK SYSTEMS INCREASED EARNINGS FROM 2002 TO 2003 WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE INCREASED REVENUE WHILE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE MILITARY SATELLITE COST GROWTH AND

THE RESOURCE 21 WRITE-OFF MENTIONED EARLIER.

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT

THE NETWORK SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FUNDING REMAINS FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF COMMUNICATIONS AND COMMAND & CONTROL CAPABILITIES THAT SUPPORT A NETWORK-CENTRIC ARCHITECTURE APPROACH FOR OUR VARIOUS GOVERNMENT

CUSTOMERS. WE ARE INVESTING IN THE COMMUNICATIONS MARKET TO ENABLE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN EXISTING AIR/GROUND PLATFORMS, INCREASE COMMUNICATIONS AVAILABILITY AND BANDWIDTH THROUGH MORE ROBUST SPACE SYSTEMS, AND LEVERAGE INNOVATIVE COMMUNICATIONS

CONCEPTS. KEY PROGRAMS IN THIS AREA INCLUDE JOINT TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEM, GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM, AND TRANSFORMATIONAL COMMUNICATIONS SYSTEM. INVESTMENTS WERE ALSO MADE TO SUPPORT VARIOUS INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDING MMA, AEW&C AIRCRAFT, AND CONCEPTS THAT WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEXT-GENERATION SPACE INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS. A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO OUR SUPPORT OF THESE DOD TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMS IS THE INVESTMENT IN THE BOEING

INTEGRATION CENTER (BIC) AND EXTENDED NETWORK OF MODELING, SIMULATION AND ANALYSIS CAPABILITIES WHERE OUR NETWORK-CENTRIC OPERATIONS CONCEPTS ARE DEVELOPED IN PARTNERSHIP WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. ALONG WITH INCREASED FUNDING TO SUPPORT THESE AREAS OF

ARCHITECTURE AND NETWORK-CENTRIC CAPABILITIES DEVELOPMENT, WE ALSO MAINTAINED OUR INVESTMENT LEVELS IN GLOBAL MISSILE DEFENSE AND ADVANCED MISSILE DEFENSE CONCEPTS AND TECHNOLOGIES. IN 2004 WE CONTINUED INVESTMENT TO PURSUE THE HOMELAND SECURITY

& SERVICES MARKET, WITH EMPHASIS ON FUNDING TO DEVELOP AND TAILOR THE NETWORK-CENTRIC CAPABILITIES ALREADY BEING APPLIED TO MANY DOD OPPORTUNITIES IN THIS EMERGING MARKET.

BACKLOG

NETWORK SYSTEMS CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG DECREASED FROM 2003 TO 2004 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE STRONG SALES ON GMD AND IDS

PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS FROM ORDERS RECEIVED IN 2003. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY ORDERS ON THE FCS PROGRAM AND THE CAPTURE OF THE MMA PROGRAM THAT CONTRIBUTED TO IDS TOTAL BACKLOG IN 2004.

THE 75% INCREASE IN CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG FROM 2002 TO 2003 IS MAINLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE INITIAL FUNDING OF THE FCS PROGRAM AND ORDERS

FOR THE GMD AND TURKEY 737 AEW&C PROGRAMS.

L&OS 2003 OPERATING EARNINGS WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A FIRST QUARTER GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $572 MILLION. THIS IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RESULTED DURING AN

INTERNAL REORGANIZATION, WHEN THE SFAS NO. 142 REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, OPERATING SEGMENTS, AND REPORTING UNIT DESIGNATIONS CHANGED, CAUSING SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN REPORTING UNIT CARRYING VALUES AND FAIR VALUES. SPECIFICALLY, THE

NEW L&OS REPORTING UNIT WAS CREATED BY COMBINING SIX PRE-EXISTING REPORTING UNITS: BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS, HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT & EXPLORATION, EXPENDABLE LAUNCH SYSTEMS, UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE JOINT VENTURE, ROCKETDYNE PROPULSION & POWER,

AND SEA LAUNCH JOINT VENTURE. THE CARRYING VALUE OF ONE OF THESE REPORTING UNITS, BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS, EXCEEDED ITS FAIR VALUE RESULTING IN THE GOODWILL BALANCES AT THIS REPORTING UNIT BEING FULLY IMPAIRED DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2002. HOWEVER,

THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE OTHER FIVE REPORTING UNITS WERE LESS THAN THEIR FAIR VALUES, SO THE GOODWILL BALANCES AT THESE REPORTING UNITS WERE NOT IMPAIRED DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2002. IN ADDITION, THE BOD APPROVED IN EARLY 2003 OUR LONG RANGE

BUSINESS PLAN WHICH INCLUDED DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS FOR THE L&OS REPORTING UNIT. THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS RESULTED IN THE NEWLY CREATED L&OS REPORTING UNIT HAVING A CARRYING VALUE THAT EXCEEDED ITS FAIR VALUE,

PROMPTING RECOGNITION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE.

L&OS 2003

OPERATING EARNINGS WERE FURTHER IMPACTED BY A SECOND QUARTER CHARGE OF $1,030 MILLION OF WHICH $835 MILLION WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DELTA IV PROGRAM, CAUSED BY A COMBINATION OF FACTORS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF THESE FACTORS WAS THE REQUIREMENT TO

SPREAD FIXED COSTS OF THE DELTA IV PROGRAM TO AN OVERALL REDUCED NUMBER OF ANTICIPATED LAUNCHES AS A RESULT OF CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE COMMERCIAL SPACE LAUNCH MARKET, ACCOUNTING FOR $412 MILLION OF THE CHARGE. THE DELTA IV PROGRAM EXPERIENCED COST

GROWTH OF $360 MILLION, PRIMARILY RELATED TO PAYLOAD INTEGRATION AND LAUNCH SUPPORT COSTS. IN EACH OF THESE CASES, THE ADDITIONAL COSTS WERE NOT BILLABLE UNDER THE RESPECTIVE CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION, THE REMAINING $63 MILLION OF THE CHARGE RESULTED

FROM DETERMINING IT WAS NO LONGER PROBABLE THAT OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CUSTOMER WOULD AGREE TO PRICE INCREASES FOR CHANGE ORDERS IN CONNECTION WITH EXISTING CONTRACTED AND AWARDED DELTA IV LAUNCHES AS A RESULT OF THE EELV PROCUREMENT INTEGRITY ISSUE.

THE REMAINING $195 MILLION OF THE SECOND QUARTER CHARGE RELATES TO BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS INCURRING ADDITIONAL COSTS AS A RESULT OF SATELLITE PROGRAM COMPLEXITIES. THESE COMPLEXITIES CAUSED TECHNICAL AND QUALITY ISSUES RESULTING IN SCHEDULE

DELAYS, COST IMPACTS, AND LATE DELIVERY PENALTIES, WHICH WERE NOT BILLABLE UNDER THE RESPECTIVE CONTRACT. THE 2003 RESULTS ALSO INCLUDE THE ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN ELLIPSO, SKYBRIDGE AND TELEDESIC RESULTING IN A NET WRITE-DOWN OF

$27 MILLION. THE 2002 RESULTS INCLUDE A $100 MILLION PRE-TAX CHARGE TO WRITE-DOWN AN EQUITY INVESTMENT IN TELEDESIC, LLC. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE 2002 DECREASED OPERATING EARNINGS WAS COST GROWTH ON COMMERCIAL SATELLITE PROGRAMS AND THE CONTINUED

DOWNTURN IN THE LAUNCH AND COMMERCIAL SATELLITE MARKET.

WE ARE A 50/50

PARTNER WITH LOCKHEED MARTIN IN A JOINT VENTURE CALLED UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL GROUND PROCESSING OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE FLEET AND FOR SPACE-RELATED OPERATIONS WITH THE USAF. UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE ALSO PERFORMS

MODIFICATIONS, TESTING AND CHECKOUT OPERATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO READY THE SPACE SHUTTLE FOR LAUNCH. UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE OPERATIONS ARE PERFORMED UNDER COST-PLUS-TYPE CONTRACTS. OUR 50% SHARE OF JOINT VENTURE EARNINGS IS RECOGNIZED AS INCOME.

THE SEGMENTS OPERATING EARNINGS INCLUDE EARNINGS OF $70 MILLION, $52 MILLION, AND $68 MILLION, FOR 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY, ATTRIBUTABLE TO UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE. THESE RESULTS INCLUDE ALL KNOWN OR EXPECTED IMPACTS RELATED TO THE

SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM BASED ON THE FINDINGS FROM THE COLUMBIA ACCIDENT INVESTIGATION BOARD (CAIB) INVESTIGATION.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENT IN L&OS DECLINED AS MOST VERSIONS OF

THE DELTA IV EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE REACHED OPERATIONAL STATUS. CONTINUED INVESTMENT WAS MADE IN THE DELTA IV HEAVY PROGRAM TO SUPPORT THE SUCCESSFUL DEMONSTRATION LAUNCH IN DECEMBER 2004. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN THIS SEGMENT TO

DEVELOP KEY TECHNOLOGIES AND SYSTEMS SOLUTIONS TO SUPPORT OUR NASA CUSTOMER IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW SPACE EXPLORATION SYSTEMS. PRUDENT INVESTMENT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES WAS MADE IN THE SATELLITE MANUFACTURING BUSINESS TO ENHANCE

EXISTING DESIGNS TO MEET EVOLVING CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS.

BACKLOG

L&OS CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG INCREASED FROM 2003 TO 2004 PRIMARILY DUE TO ORDERS IN OUR COMMERCIAL SATELLITE (DIRECTV ORDER FOR 3 SATELLITES) AND NASA BUSINESSES. THIS INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SOLID SALES FROM OUR NASA BUSINESS UNIT.

THE CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG DECREASE FROM 2002 TO 2003 WAS DUE TO THE

ADJUSTMENT IN THE DELTA IV LAUNCH MANIFEST. THE ADJUSTMENT WAS A RESULT OF MISSIONS LOST ON THE EELV (SEE EELV SUSPENSION IN RISK FACTORS SECTION) CONTRACT AND A CONTINUED WEAKNESS IN THE COMMERCIAL SPACE MARKET AND SALES ON THE EXISTING

ORDERS.

BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, BCCS PORTFOLIO CONSISTED OF FINANCING LEASES, NOTES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING

LEASES, INVESTMENTS AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE.

BCCS

STRATEGIC DIRECTION HAS SHIFTED FROM A FOCUS ON GROWING THE PORTFOLIO TO A FOCUS ON SUPPORTING OUR MAJOR OPERATING UNITS AND MANAGING OVERALL PORTFOLIO RISK EXPOSURES. FOR THE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT MARKET, BCC FACILITATES, ARRANGES, STRUCTURES AND/OR

PROVIDES SELECTIVE FINANCING SOLUTIONS TO OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT CUSTOMERS. FOR THE DEFENSE AND SPACE MARKETS, BCC PRIMARILY ENGAGES IN ARRANGING AND STRUCTURING FINANCING SOLUTIONS FOR OUR IDS SEGMENT GOVERNMENT CUSTOMERS. IN ADDITION,

BCC CONTINUES TO ENHANCE ITS RISK MANAGEMENT ACTIVITIES TO MANAGE EXPOSURES ASSOCIATED WITH ITS CURRENT PORTFOLIO AND FUTURE BUSINESS ACTIVITIES.

ON MAY 24, 2004, BCC ENTERED INTO A PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION (GECC) TO SELL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS RELATED TO

ITS FORMER COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN PROVIDING LEASE AND LOAN FINANCING TO A BROAD RANGE OF COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL CUSTOMERS. (SEE NOTE 9). THE ASSETS SOLD TO GECC CONSISTED OF LEASES AND FINANCING

ARRANGEMENTS HAVING A CARRYING VALUE OF $1.9 BILLION AS OF MAY 31, 2004. THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED, CALLED FOR THE SALE OF THE ASSETS TO TAKE PLACE IN A SERIES OF CLOSINGS, COMMENCING ON MAY 31, 2004 AND ENDING NO LATER THAN DECEMBER 31,

2004. THE FINAL ASSET SALE CLOSED ON DECEMBER 27, 2004. BCC INTENDS TO DISPOSE OF THE REMAINING ASSETS IDENTIFIED TO ITS COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WITH GECC BY THE END OF THE

SECOND QUARTER OF 2005.

REFER TO DISCUSSION OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY

ENVIRONMENT IN THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES  BUSINESS ENVIRONMENTS AND TRENDS.

AIRCRAFT VALUES AND LEASE RATES ARE IMPACTED BY THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF AIRCRAFT THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUT OF SERVICE. THE NUMBER OF WORLDWIDE PARKED COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT HAS DECLINED BY APPROXIMATELY 100 AIRCRAFT FROM THE NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT

PARKED AT DECEMBER 31, 2003, REACHING A NEW POST-SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 LOW IN TERMS OF BOTH THE NUMBER OF PARKED AIRCRAFT AND THE PARKED PERCENTAGE OF THE ACTIVE FLEET. APPROXIMATELY 1,900 COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT (10.6% OF CURRENT WORLD FLEET) CONTINUE

TO BE PARKED, INCLUDING BOTH IN PRODUCTION AND OUT-OF-PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT TYPES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BCCS PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 TOTALED $9.7 BILLION, OF WHICH $9.3 BILLION WAS RELATED TO OUR PRODUCTS,

PRIMARILY COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. WHILE WORLDWIDE TRAFFIC LEVELS EXCEED TRAFFIC LEVELS CARRIED BY THE AIRLINES IN 2000, THE EFFECTS OF DECLINING YIELDS AND HIGHER FUEL PRICES ON THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY CONTINUE TO IMPACT COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT VALUES.

RECENTLY PUBLISHED SOURCES AND MARKET TRANSACTIONS INDICATE THAT, WHILE LEASE RATES FOR AIRCRAFT ARE INCREASING, VALUES FOR THE VARIOUS AIRCRAFT TYPES SERVING AS COLLATERAL IN BCCS PORTFOLIO GENERALLY HAVE NOT INCREASED. AIRCRAFT VALUATIONS

COULD DECLINE MATERIALLY IF SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF AIRCRAFT, PARTICULARLY TYPES WITH RELATIVELY FEW OPERATORS, ARE IDLED ON ACCOUNT OF FURTHER AIRLINE BANKRUPTCIES OR RESTRUCTURINGS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE CREDIT RATINGS OF MANY AIRLINES,

PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S., HAVE REMAINED AT LOW LEVELS.

ON JANUARY 12,

2005, COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES DECIDED TO CONCLUDE PRODUCTION OF THE 717 PROGRAM IN 2006 DUE TO THE LACK OF OVERALL MARKET DEMAND FOR THE AIRCRAFT. WHILE BCC CONTINUES TO BELIEVE IN THE UTILITY AND MARKETABILITY OF THE 717 AIRCRAFT, BCC IS UNABLE TO

PREDICT WHETHER OR HOW THE END OF THE 717 PROGRAM, AS WELL AS OVERALL MARKET CONDITIONS, MAY IMPACT 717 AIRCRAFT VALUES AND RENTAL RATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, $2.4 BILLION OF BCCS PORTFOLIO WAS COLLATERALIZED BY 717 AIRCRAFT. SHOULD THE 717

AIRCRAFT SUFFER A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN UTILITY AND MARKET ACCEPTANCE, THE AIRCRAFT VALUES MAY DECLINE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN INCREASE TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES. WHILE BCC IS UNABLE TO PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF THESE IMPACTS

OCCURRING, SUCH IMPACTS COULD RESULT IN A POTENTIAL MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN OCTOBER 2003, COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES ANNOUNCED THE DECISION TO END PRODUCTION OF THE 757 PROGRAM, AND THE FINAL AIRCRAFT WAS PRODUCED IN OCTOBER 2004. WHILE BCC IS

UNABLE TO DETERMINE HOW MUCH OF THE 757 USED AIRCRAFT VALUE DECLINE WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DECISION TO END PRODUCTION OF THE 757 PROGRAM, THE IMPACT OF ANY DECLINES IN 757 USED AIRCRAFT VALUES DUE TO THIS DECISION HAD BEEN REFLECTED IN RESERVES, AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, $1.5 BILLION OF BCCS PORTFOLIO WAS COLLATERALIZED BY 757 AIRCRAFT OF VARIOUS VINTAGES AND VARIANTS. THIS INCLUDED $1.2 BILLION OF PASSENGER AIRCRAFT (33 AIRCRAFT AT 12 OPERATORS). THE REMAINDER OF

THE 757 PORTFOLIO CONSISTED OF CONVERTED FREIGHTERS ON LONG-TERM LEASE.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, BCC HAD $37 MILLION OF ASSETS THAT WERE HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE, OF WHICH $25 MILLION WERE IDENTIFIED WITH FIRM CONTRACTS TO BE PLACED ON LEASE. ADDITIONALLY, APPROXIMATELY $409 MILLION OF BCCS PORTFOLIO

CURRENTLY REPRESENTS SCHEDULED LEASE TERMINATIONS IN 2005 FOR WHICH THE RELATED AIRCRAFT WILL BE REMARKETED, OF WHICH $109 MILLION WERE IDENTIFIED WITH FIRM CONTRACTS IN PLACE AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 TO BE SOLD OR PLACED ON LEASE. POTENTIAL DELAYS IN

SELLING OR PLACING THESE ASSETS ON LEASE AT REASONABLE RATES MAY NEGATIVELY AFFECT BCCS EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

SIGNIFICANT CUSTOMER CONTINGENCIES

A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BCCS PORTFOLIO IS CONCENTRATED AMONG COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS. CERTAIN CUSTOMERS HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION OR REQUESTED LEASE OR LOAN RESTRUCTURINGS; THESE

NEGOTIATIONS WERE IN VARIOUS STAGES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004. THESE BANKRUPTCIES OR RESTRUCTURINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON BCCS EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

UNITED AIRLINES, INC.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, UNITED ACCOUNTED FOR

$1.1 BILLION AND $1.2 BILLION (11.7% AND 11.5%) OF BCCS TOTAL PORTFOLIO. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE UNITED PORTFOLIO WAS SECURED BY SECURITY INTERESTS IN TWO 767 AIRCRAFT AND 13 777 AIRCRAFT AND BY AN OWNERSHIP AND SECURITY INTERESTS IN FIVE

757 AIRCRAFT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, UNITED WAS CURRENT ON ALL OF ITS OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO THESE 20 AIRCRAFT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, UNITED WAS BCCS SECOND LARGEST CUSTOMER. UNITED CONTINUES TO OPERATE UNDER CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION.

ON JUNE 28, 2004, UNITEDS APPLICATION TO OBTAIN FEDERAL LOAN GUARANTEES WAS DENIED BY THE AIRLINE TRANSPORTATION STABILIZATION BOARD, WHICH ALSO WITHDREW UNITEDS ELIGIBILITY TO REAPPLY. ON AUGUST 20, 2004, UNITED OBTAINED APPROVAL FROM

THE BANKRUPTCY COURT TO EXTEND ITS DEBTOR-IN-POSSESSION FINANCING CREDIT FACILITIES THROUGH JUNE 30, 2005

48

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AND INCREASE ITS AVAILABLE FUNDS BY $500 MILLION. UNITED IS CONTINUING TO PURSUE ALTERNATIVE FINANCING THROUGH PRIVATE INVESTORS. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2003, BCC

COMPLETED A RESTRUCTURING OF UNITEDS AIRCRAFT LOANS AND LEASES. THE LEASE RATE FOR THE FIVE 757S ON LEASE TO UNITED WAS NEGOTIATED DOWNWARD. BCC APPLIED GUIDANCE IN SFAS NO. 13,

ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES

, AND DETERMINED THAT THESE LEASES

WERE REQUIRED TO BE RECLASSIFIED FROM FINANCE LEASES TO OPERATING LEASES. THE LOANS WITH UNITED WERE RESTRUCTURED TO DEFER CERTAIN PRINCIPAL PAYMENTS BY EXTENDING THE MATURITY OF THE LOANS. BCC APPLIED THE GUIDANCE IN SFAS NO. 15,

ACCOUNTING FOR

DEBTORS AND CREDITORS FOR TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURINGS

, AND DETERMINED THAT A TROUBLED DEBT RESTRUCTURING CHARGE WAS NOT REQUIRED BECAUSE THE EFFECTIVE YIELD OF EACH LOAN RECEIVABLE AFTER THE RESTRUCTURING WAS EQUAL TO OR GREATER THAN ITS

EFFECTIVE YIELD PRIOR TO THE RESTRUCTURING.

UNITED RETAINS CERTAIN

RIGHTS BY OPERATING UNDER CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO REJECT THE RESTRUCTURING TERMS WITH ITS CREDITORS AND RETURN AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING BCCS AIRCRAFT. THE TERMS OF BCCS RESTRUCTURING WITH UNITED, WHICH WERE

APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL BANKRUPTCY COURT, SET FORTH THE TERMS UNDER WHICH ALL 20 AIRCRAFT BCC FINANCED ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN SERVICE UPON UNITEDS EMERGENCE FROM CHAPTER 11 PROTECTION. IF UNITED EXERCISES ITS RIGHT TO REJECT THE AGREED UPON

RESTRUCTURING TERMS, THE TERMS OF ALL OF THE LEASES AND LOANS WITH UNITED WOULD IMMEDIATELY REVERT TO THE ORIGINAL TERMS, WHICH ARE GENERALLY LESS FAVORABLE TO UNITED. UNITED WOULD RETAIN ITS RIGHTS UNDER CHAPTER 11 TO RETURN BCCS AIRCRAFT IN

THE EVENT OF A REVERSION TO THE ORIGINAL LEASE AND LOAN TERMS. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004, UNITED REQUESTED THAT BCC RESTRUCTURE ITS FINANCING TERMS AS PART OF THEIR ONGOING EFFORTS TO EMERGE FROM BANKRUPTCY. BCC IS CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE

REQUEST FROM UNITED.

ATA HOLDINGS CORP.

AT DECEMBER 31,

2004 AND 2003, ATA HOLDINGS CORP. (ATA) ACCOUNTED FOR $705 MILLION AND $743 MILLION (7.3% AND 7.3%) OF BCCS TOTAL PORTFOLIO. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE ATA PORTFOLIO PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF 12 FINANCE LEASES FOR 757 AIRCRAFT AND AN INVESTMENT IN

ATA MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK WITH A FACE VALUE OF $50 MILLION, WHICH WAS WRITTEN DOWN TO ZERO IN 2004.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, BCCS ASSESSMENT OF ATAS CONTINUED FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED THEM TO CONCLUDE THAT ITS PORTFOLIO OF FINANCE LEASES AND NOTE RECEIVABLE WITH ATA WERE

SPECIFICALLY IMPAIRED. ACCORDINGLY, IN 2004, BCC INCREASED ITS ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES BY APPROXIMATELY $49 MILLION (AN ADDITIONAL $38 MILLION WAS RECORDED BY THE OTHER SEGMENT) IN ORDER TO RESERVE FOR THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE CARRYING

VALUE OF THE ATA RELATED ASSETS EXCEEDED THE ASSETS COLLATERAL VALUES. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, ATA REQUESTED THAT BCC RESTRUCTURE ITS FINANCE LEASE TERMS AND PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SHORT-TERM FINANCING SUPPORT. ON OCTOBER

26, 2004, ATA FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION. AS A RESULT, ON DECEMBER 29, 2004, BCC ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT IN PRINCIPLE WITH ATA WHEREBY ATA AGREED TO CONTINUE TO LEASE THE 12 757S UNDER RESTRUCTURED TERMS AND AGREED TO RETURN EIGHT

OF THE 12 757S DURING THE SECOND HALF OF 2005 AND EARLY 2006. THE RESTRUCTURED LEASE TERMS WITH ATA, INCLUDING ATAS AGREEMENT TO RETURN THE EIGHT 757 AIRCRAFT STARTING IN JULY 2005 ARE SUBJECT TO APPROVAL BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. ATA IS

OBLIGATED TO PAY RENT ON ALL AIRCRAFT UNTIL RETURNED.

WHILE BCC BELIEVES

IT HAS PROVIDED FOR AN ADEQUATE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES ON ATAS FINANCE LEASES AND NOTES RECEIVABLE, IN THE EVENT THAT FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS RESULT IN THE RETURN OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT, THERE COULD BE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION, AT LEAST UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE AIRCRAFT ARE SOLD OR REDEPLOYED FOR ADEQUATE CONSIDERATION.

HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. (HAWAIIAN) ACCOUNTED FOR $456 MILLION AND

$506 MILLION (4.7% AND 5.0%) OF BCCS TOTAL PORTFOLIO. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE HAWAIIAN PORTFOLIO CONSISTED OF 11 717 AIRCRAFT AND THREE 767 AIRCRAFT. HAWAIIAN FILED FOR CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION ON MARCH 21, 2003. IN DECEMBER 2003 AND

JANUARY 2004, BCC

49

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PERMITTED HAWAIIAN TO RETURN TWO 717 AIRCRAFT LEASED BY BCC. THESE 717 AIRCRAFT WERE LEASED TO A THIRD PARTY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2004.

IN SEPTEMBER 2004, BCC REACHED AN AGREEMENT WITH THE BANKRUPTCY TRUSTEE FOR THE

HAWAIIAN ESTATE RELATING TO THE RESTRUCTURING OF ALL OF ITS LEASES AND ON THE AMOUNT OF ITS UNSECURED CLAIM RESULTING FROM HAWAIIANS BANKRUPTCY. THE CLAIM AMOUNT REPRESENTED COSTS AND LOSSES INCURRED BY BCC FOR THE PERIOD OF TIME PRIOR TO THE

SEPTEMBER 2004 SETTLEMENT AND LOSSES THAT WOULD BE INCURRED BY BCC BASED ON THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE RESTRUCTURED AND THE ORIGINAL LEASE PAYMENTS. ON SEPTEMBER 27, 2004, FOLLOWING A REQUEST BY HAWAIIANS TRUSTEE, THE BANKRUPTCY COURT

APPROVED BCCS UNSECURED CLAIM AGAINST THE HAWAIIAN ESTATE AND ALSO APPROVED THE NEW TERMS OF ITS RESTRUCTURED LEASES. IN SEPTEMBER 2004, BCC SOLD ITS UNSECURED CLAIM TO RC AVIATION LLC (RANCH). IN CONNECTION WITH THE APPROVAL OF ITS CLAIM BY

THE BANKRUPTCY COURT, BCC RECORDED $35 MILLION OF INCOME RELATING TO RECOVERED COSTS AND LOST REVENUES PRIOR TO THE APPROVAL OF THE CLAIM BY THE BANKRUPTCY COURT. ADDITIONALLY, AS A RESULT OF BCCS APPROVAL OF CLAIMS FOR LOST LEASE RENTAL

REVENUE, BCC RECORDED $31 MILLION OF UNEARNED INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH ITS 767 LEASES TO HAWAIIAN. BCC RECORDED A PROVISION FOR LOSSES OF $13 MILLION DUE TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE APPROVED BANKRUPTCY CLAIM AND THE AMOUNT IT RECEIVED WHEN IT SOLD

THE CLAIM. PRIOR TO HAWAIIANS BANKRUPTCY, BCC ACCOUNTED FOR ALL OF ITS 717 LEASES AND TWO OF ITS THREE 767 LEASES AS FINANCE LEASES. SUBSEQUENT TO THE APPROVAL OF THE RESTRUCTURED LEASE TERMS, BCC WILL CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE LEASES AS

FINANCE LEASES.

HAWAIIAN RETAINS CERTAIN RIGHTS BY OPERATING UNDER

CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE RIGHT TO REJECT RESTRUCTURING TERMS WITH ITS CREDITORS AND RETURN AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING BCCS AIRCRAFT. THE TERMS OF BCCS RESTRUCTURING WITH HAWAIIAN, WHICH WERE APPROVED BY THE FEDERAL

BANKRUPTCY COURT, SET FORTH THE TERMS UNDER WHICH ALL 14 AIRCRAFT FINANCED BY BCC ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN SERVICE UPON HAWAIIANS EMERGENCE FROM CHAPTER 11 PROTECTION.

THE DECREASE IN REVENUE IN 2004 COMPARED WITH 2003 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOWER

NEW BUSINESS VOLUME. THE INCREASE IN REVENUE IN 2003 COMPARED WITH 2002 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO GROWTH IN THE PORTFOLIO.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXPENSES. THE INCREASE IN 2004 OPERATING EARNINGS WAS PRINCIPALLY DRIVEN BY A SUBSTANTIAL DECREASE IN THE PROVISION FOR LOSSES FROM A PROVISION OF $151 MILLION IN 2003

TO A RECOVERY OF $38 MILLION IN 2004 DUE TO RECEIVABLE RECOVERIES AND ASSET SALES DURING 2004, LOWER CHARGES RELATED TO RECEIVABLE RESTRUCTURINGS IN 2004 COMPARED WITH 2003, THE MITIGATION OF COLLATERAL EXPOSURE FROM AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN

CUSTOMERS, AND REFINEMENTS IN PORTFOLIO MEASUREMENTS IN 2004 AND A DECLINE IN BCCS RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO. THE INCREASE IN NET INCOME WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECREASE IN BCCS TOTAL REVENUE AND INCREASES IN OPERATING EXPENSES, HIGHER

ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE RELATED PRIMARILY TO THE WRITEDOWN OF TWO INVESTMENTS AND DEBT REDEMPTION COSTS.

AS SUMMARIZED IN THE FOLLOWING TABLE, DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE RECOGNIZED PRE-TAX EXPENSES OF $165 MILLION IN RESPONSE TO THE DETERIORATION IN THE CREDIT WORTHINESS OF BCCS AIRLINE

CUSTOMERS, AIRLINE BANKRUPTCY FILINGS AND THE CONTINUED DECLINE IN THE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND GENERAL EQUIPMENT ASSET VALUES, OF WHICH $68 MILLION RELATED TO BCC. FOR THE SAME PERIOD IN 2003, WE RECOGNIZED PRE-TAX EXPENSES OF $338 MILLION, OF WHICH

$272 MILLION RELATED TO BCC.

DURING 2004, BCCS DECREASE

IN THE PROVISION FOR LOSSES INCLUDED A SPECIAL REDUCTION OF $55 MILLION OFFSET BY THE NORMAL MONTHLY PROVISION OF $17 MILLION. THE PRIMARY FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THIS REDUCTION IN THE PROVISION FOR LOSSES DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004

WERE: $53 MILLION OF BENEFIT FROM THE MITIGATION OF COLLATERAL EXPOSURE FROM AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS; $28 MILLION OF NET BENEFIT DUE TO REFINEMENTS IN THE METHODOLOGY FOR MEASURING COLLATERAL VALUES; $11 MILLION OF NET BENEFIT DUE TO THE

SALE OF VARIOUS NOTES THUS DECREASING COLLATERAL EXPOSURE; AND A $49 MILLION INCREASE IN THE REQUIREMENT IN THE ALLOWANCE ACCOUNT RESULTING FROM THE DETERMINATION THAT RECEIVABLES FROM ATA WERE SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT. THE OTHER SEGMENT

RECORDED AN $82 MILLION CHARGE TO EARNINGS DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, COMPARED TO $61 MILLION AND $80 MILLION DURING THE SAME PERIOD IN 2003 AND 2002. THE INCREASE IN THE OTHER SEGMENTS PROVISION FOR LOSSES DURING THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2004 WAS DUE TO DETERIORATED AIRLINE CREDIT RATINGS AND DEPRESSED AIRCRAFT VALUES BASED ON OUR QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT OF THE ADEQUACY OF CUSTOMER FINANCING RESERVES, WHICH WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE DETERMINATION THAT RECEIVABLES FROM

ATA WERE SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT.

ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, BCC RECORDED PRE-TAX NON-CASH ASSET IMPAIRMENT-RELATED CHARGES TOTALING $106 MILLION. THIS WAS COMPRISED OF $47 MILLION RELATED TO AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT OF A HELD-TO-MATURITY INVESTMENT IN ATA MATURING IN 2015,

$32 MILLION RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF A D TRANCHE EETC WHICH FINANCES AIRCRAFT WITH DELTA, $16 MILLION OF SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED PRIMARILY TO AIRCRAFT TRADING AND $11 MILLION OF VALUATION LOSS ON ONE BOEING BUSINESS JET RECLASSIFIED

FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS TO CONTINUING OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF OUR

51

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DECISION TO RETAIN THE AIRCRAFT IN OUR EXECUTIVE FLEET. DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF 2003, BCC RECOGNIZED CHARGES OF $121 MILLION, OF WHICH $21 MILLION WAS DUE TO THE

WRITE-OFF OF FORWARD-STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO HAWAIIAN. DURING THE SAME PERIOD OF 2002, BCC RECOGNIZED CHARGES OF $93 MILLION. ADDITIONALLY, THE OTHER SEGMENT RECOGNIZED CHARGES OF $15 MILLION, $5 MILLION, AND $146 MILLION DURING THE

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY. DURING 2004, THE CHARGE CONSISTED OF $13 MILLION RELATED TO THE DECLINE IN LEASE RATES ON CERTAIN AIRCRAFT AND A CHARGE OF $2 MILLION RELATED TO AIRCRAFT AND EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASE

AND HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE. BCC CAREFULLY MONITORS THE RELATIVE VALUE OF AIRCRAFT EQUIPMENT SINCE WE REMAIN AT SUBSTANTIAL ECONOMIC RISK TO SIGNIFICANT DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF AIRCRAFT EQUIPMENT AND THEIR ASSOCIATED LEASE RATES.

OTHER SEGMENT

OTHER SEGMENT OPERATING LOSSES WERE $535 MILLION DURING 2004 AS COMPARED TO LOSSES OF $379 MILLION DURING 2003. THE INCREASE IN

OPERATING LOSSES REFLECTS INCREASED COSTS OF $36 MILLION AT CONNEXION BY BOEING

SM

IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LAUNCH OF COMMERCIAL SERVICES

WHICH BEGAN IN MAY 2004, A $61 MILLION WRITE-OFF OF DEPRECIATION RELATED TO A DEMOLISHED BUILDING, AN $18 MILLION LOSS RELATED TO ACCOUNTING FOR VARIOUS REAL PROPERTY TRANSACTIONS AND INCREASED EMPLOYER TAXES OF $12 MILLION RELATED TO OUR SHARE

VALUE TRUST PAYOUT.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE HAD INVESTMENTS OF

APPROXIMATELY $3.4 BILLION. ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT TEST ON OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES TO DETERMINE IF THE FAIR VALUE DECLINE OF A SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. IF THE IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, WE RESET THE COST

BASIS FOR THE IMPAIRED SECURITY AND RECORD THE CHARGE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. (SEE NOTE 12.)

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING IS USED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES PREDOMINATELY BY THE A&WS, NETWORK SYSTEMS, SUPPORT SYSTEMS AND L&OS SEGMENTS WITHIN IDS. THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS: MILITARY AIRCRAFT, HELICOPTERS, MISSILES, SPACE SYSTEMS, MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS, SATELLITES, ROCKET ENGINES, AND INFORMATION AND BATTLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. THE MAJORITY OF BUSINESS CONDUCTED IN THESE SEGMENTS IS

PERFORMED UNDER CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT EXTEND OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. CONTRACT ACCOUNTING INVOLVES A JUDGMENTAL PROCESS OF ESTIMATING THE TOTAL SALES AND COSTS FOR EACH CONTRACT, WHICH RESULTS IN THE

DEVELOPMENT OF ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES. FOR EACH CONTRACT, THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED.

TOTAL CONTRACT SALES ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON NEGOTIATED CONTRACT PRICES AND QUANTITIES,

MODIFIED BY OUR ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CONTRACT OPTIONS, CHANGE ORDERS, INCENTIVE AND AWARD PROVISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE, AND PRICE ADJUSTMENT CLAUSES (SUCH AS INFLATION OR INDEX-BASED CLAUSES).

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE MAJORITY OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. GENERALLY THE PRICE IS BASED ON ESTIMATED COST TO PRODUCE THE PRODUCT OR SERVICE PLUS PROFIT. THE FEDERAL

ACQUISITION REGULATIONS PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE TYPES OF COST THAT WILL BE REIMBURSED IN ESTABLISHING CONTRACT PRICE. TOTAL CONTRACT COST ESTIMATES ARE LARGELY BASED ON NEGOTIATED OR ESTIMATED PURCHASE CONTRACT TERMS, HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS,

BUSINESS BASE AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE INFLATIONARY TRENDS, TECHNICAL AND SCHEDULE RISK, INTERNAL AND SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS VOLUME ASSUMPTIONS, ASSET UTILIZATION, AND

ANTICIPATED LABOR AGREEMENTS.

SALES RELATED TO CONTRACTS WITH FIXED

PRICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS DELIVERIES ARE MADE, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD BEFORE DELIVERIES BEGIN, FOR WHICH SALES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE

MILESTONES. SALES RELATED TO CONTRACTS IN WHICH WE ARE REIMBURSED FOR COSTS INCURRED PLUS AN AGREED UPON PROFIT ARE RECORDED AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. CONTRACTS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS TO EARN INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES IF TARGETS ARE ACHIEVED. INCENTIVE

AND AWARD FEES THAT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED ARE RECORDED OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD OF THE CONTRACT. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED ARE RECORDED WHEN AWARDED.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES INVOLVES PROCEDURES AND PERSONNEL IN ALL

AREAS THAT PROVIDE FINANCIAL OR PRODUCTION INFORMATION ON THE STATUS OF CONTRACTS. ESTIMATES OF EACH SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS SALES AND COSTS ARE REVIEWED AND REASSESSED QUARTERLY. ANY CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES RESULT IN RECOGNITION OF

CUMULATIVE ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CONTRACT PROFIT IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH CHANGES ARE MADE. DUE TO THE SIZE AND NATURE OF MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS, THE ESTIMATION OF TOTAL SALES AND COSTS THROUGH COMPLETION IS COMPLICATED AND SUBJECT TO MANY VARIABLES.

ASSUMPTIONS ARE MADE REGARDING THE LENGTH OF TIME TO COMPLETE EACH CONTRACT BECAUSE ESTIMATED COSTS ALSO INCLUDE EXPECTED CHANGES IN WAGES, PRICES FOR MATERIALS, FIXED COSTS, AND OTHER COSTS.

DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JUDGMENT IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS

LIKELY THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT COST OF SALES AMOUNTS COULD BE RECORDED IF WE USED DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS, OR IF THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS/ESTIMATES, SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE, OR CIRCUMSTANCES MAY

ADVERSELY OR POSITIVELY AFFECT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN FUTURE PERIODS.

DURING 2004, IDSS GROSS MARGIN PERFORMANCE FELL WITHIN THE HISTORICAL RANGE OF PLUS OR MINUS 0.5% CHANGE TO GROSS MARGIN. IF THE COMBINED GROSS MARGIN FOR ALL CONTRACTS IN IDS FOR ALL OF 2004 HAD BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE HIGHER OR LOWER

BY 0.5%, IT WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED INCOME FOR THE YEAR BY APPROXIMATELY $152 MILLION.

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

WE USE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING TO ACCOUNT

FOR SALES AND COST OF SALES RELATED TO ALL OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAMS BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT. PROGRAM ACCOUNTING IS A METHOD OF ACCOUNTING APPLICABLE TO PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED FOR DELIVERY UNDER PRODUCTION-TYPE CONTRACTS WHERE

PROFITABILITY IS REALIZED OVER MULTIPLE CONTRACTS AND YEARS. UNDER PROGRAM ACCOUNTING, INVENTORIABLE PRODUCTION COSTS (INCLUDING OVERHEAD), PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS AND WARRANTY COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED AND CHARGED AS COST OF SALES BY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF

BY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR CONTRACTS. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. TO ESTABLISH

THE RELATIONSHIP OF SALES TO COST OF SALES, PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF (A) THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN A PROGRAM, (B) THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE UNITS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED, AND (C) THE UNITS

EXPECTED SALES PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING, AND WARRANTY COSTS FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM. (SEE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES DISCUSSION IN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY SECTION.)

53

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE USE OF ESTIMATES IN PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES THE DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE RELATIONSHIP

OF SALES TO COSTS FOR THE DEFINED PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. FACTORS THAT MUST BE ESTIMATED INCLUDE SALES PRICE, LABOR AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS, MATERIAL COSTS, PROCURED PARTS, MAJOR COMPONENT COSTS, AND OVERHEAD COSTS. TO ENSURE RELIABILITY IN

OUR ESTIMATES, WE EMPLOY A RIGOROUS ESTIMATING PROCESS THAT IS REVIEWED AND UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE RECOGNIZED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS.

UNDERLYING ALL ESTIMATES USED FOR PROGRAM ACCOUNTING IS THE FORECASTED MARKET AND CORRESPONDING PRODUCTION RATES. ESTIMATION OF THE

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH PROGRAM TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SEVERAL FACTORS THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF THE DEMAND FOR THE PARTICULAR PROGRAM, SUCH AS FIRM ORDERS, LETTERS OF INTENT FROM PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS, AND MARKET STUDIES. TOTAL ESTIMATED PROGRAM

SALES ARE DETERMINED BY ESTIMATING THE MODEL MIX AND SALES PRICE FOR ALL UNSOLD UNITS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, ADDED TOGETHER WITH THE SALES FOR ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS UNDER CONTRACT. THE SALES PRICES FOR ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS WITHIN THE

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY INCLUDE AN ESCALATION ADJUSTMENT THAT IS BASED ON PROJECTED ESCALATION RATES, CONSISTENT WITH TYPICAL SALES CONTRACT TERMS. COST ESTIMATES ARE BASED LARGELY ON NEGOTIATED AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS WITH SUPPLIERS, HISTORICAL

PERFORMANCE TRENDS, AND BUSINESS BASE AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS.

FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE PRODUCTION RATES, INTERNAL AND SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, ASSET UTILIZATION, ANTICIPATED LABOR AGREEMENTS, AND INFLATIONARY TRENDS.

WE RECOGNIZE SALES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DELIVERIES AS EACH UNIT IS COMPLETED AND

ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. THE SALES RECOGNIZED REPRESENT THE PRICE NEGOTIATED WITH THE CUSTOMER, ADJUSTED BY AN ESCALATION FORMULA. THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE FOR THE TOTAL

REMAINING PROGRAM TO THE AMOUNT OF SALES RECOGNIZED FOR AIRPLANES DELIVERED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER DURING THE QUARTER. BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW AIRPLANE PROGRAM (KNOWN AS THE

LEARNING CURVE EFFECT), THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED FOR PRODUCTION OF THE EARLY UNITS IN THE PROGRAM WILL EXCEED THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES FOR THOSE UNITS. THE EXCESS OR ACTUAL COSTS OVER THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS

PRESENTED AS DEFERRED PRODUCTION COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORY ALONG WITH UNAMORTIZED TOOLING COSTS.

OUR EXPERIENCE IN THE LAST TWO YEARS, WITH ALL CURRENT PROGRAMS BEING RELATIVELY MATURE, HAS BEEN THAT ESTIMATED CHANGES DUE TO MODEL MIX, ESCALATION, COST

PERFORMANCE, AND ACCOUNTING QUANTITY ADJUSTMENTS HAVE RESULTED IN A NET RANGE OF PLUS OR MINUS 1.0% FOR THE COMBINED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES OF ALL COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAMS. IF COMBINED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES FOR ALL COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE

PROGRAMS FOR ALL OF 2004 HAD BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE HIGHER OR LOWER BY 1.0%, IT WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED INCOME FOR 2004 BY APPROXIMATELY $180 MILLION.

AIRCRAFT VALUATION

USED AIRCRAFT UNDER TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS AND AIRCRAFT UNDER REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNING A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF NEW AIRCRAFT (SALE AIRCRAFT), WE HAVE ENTERED

INTO SPECIFIED-PRICE TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO TRADE IN USED AIRCRAFT UPON THE PURCHASE OF SALE AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS

WHEREIN WE AGREE TO REPURCHASE THE SALE AIRCRAFT AT A SPECIFIED PRICE, GENERALLY TEN YEARS AFTER DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT. OUR REPURCHASE OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT IS CONTINGENT UPON A FUTURE, MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL

NEW AIRCRAFT. IF, IN THE FUTURE, WE EXECUTE AN AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT, AND IF THE CUSTOMER EXERCISES ITS RIGHT TO SELL THE SALE AIRCRAFT TO US, A CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENT WOULD BECOME A TRADE-IN COMMITMENT. BASED

ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, WE BELIEVE THAT VERY FEW, IF ANY, OF OUR OUTSTANDING CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS.

54

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXPOSURE RELATED TO THE TRADE-IN OF USED AIRCRAFT RESULTING FROM TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS MAY TAKE THE FORM OF: (1) ADJUSTMENTS TO REVENUE RELATED TO THE SALE OF NEW

AIRCRAFT DETERMINED AT THE SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT, AND/OR (2) CHARGES TO COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RELATED TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT THAT OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR NEW

AIRCRAFT BUT PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE OF THE USED TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT. THE TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITEM (2) ABOVE IS RECORDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION.

OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PROBABLE TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS ARE MEASURED AS THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROSS AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO CUSTOMERS AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL. THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL IS DETERMINED USING AIRCRAFT SPECIFIC DATA SUCH AS, MODEL, AGE AND CONDITION, MARKET CONDITIONS FOR SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT

AND SIMILAR MODELS, AND MULTIPLE VALUATION SOURCES. THIS PROCESS USES OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE MARKET FOR EACH TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT, WHICH IN MOST INSTANCES BEGINS YEARS BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE AIRCRAFT. THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE MARKETS TO WHICH WE

CONTINUALLY PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO PLACE USED AIRCRAFT. THESE MARKETS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, (1) THE RESALE MARKET, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY INCLUDE THE COST OF LONG-TERM STORAGE, (2) THE LEASING MARKET, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR

REFURBISHMENT COSTS TO MEET THE LEASING CUSTOMERS REQUIREMENTS, OR (3) THE SCRAP MARKET. COLLATERAL VALUATION VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON WHICH MARKET WE DETERMINE IS MOST LIKELY FOR EACH AIRCRAFT. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE UPDATE OUR

VALUATION ANALYSIS BASED ON THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH PLACING EACH AIRCRAFT INTO A MARKET. THIS QUARTERLY COLLATERAL VALUATION PROCESS YIELDS RESULTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY LOWER THAN RESIDUAL VALUE ESTIMATES BY INDEPENDENT SOURCES AND TENDS

TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT RESULTS UPON THE ACTUAL PLACEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT.

BASED ON THE BEST MARKET INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO PERFORM ON TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WITH GROSS AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO CUSTOMERS TOTALING $116 MILLION AND $582 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND

2003, RESPECTIVELY. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDED $25 MILLION AND $65 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH REPRESENTS THE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS.

USING A MEASUREMENT DATE OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, HAD THE ESTIMATE OF COLLATERAL VALUE

USED TO CALCULATE OUR OBLIGATION RELATED TO TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS BEEN 10% HIGHER OR LOWER THAN OUR ACTUAL ASSESSMENT, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES WOULD HAVE DECREASED OR INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION. WE CONTINUALLY UPDATE OUR

ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF OUR TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR ALL THESE COMMITMENTS FOR ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS.

USED AIRCRAFT ACQUIRED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET AS IT IS OUR INTENT TO SELL THESE

ASSETS. TO MITIGATE COSTS AND ENHANCE MARKETABILITY, AIRCRAFT MAY BE PLACED ON OPERATING LEASE. WHILE ON OPERATING LEASE, THE ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER FINANCING, HOWEVER, THE VALUATION CONTINUES TO BE BASED ON THE LOWER OF COST OR

MARKET. THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET ASSESSMENT IS PERFORMED QUARTERLY USING THE PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

ASSET VALUATION FOR EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASE, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE, AND COLLATERAL UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES

INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSETS ARE OPERATING LEASE

EQUIPMENT, NOTES RECEIVABLES AND SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES. SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES ARE TREATED AS RECEIVABLES AND ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 13,

ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES

AND SFAS NO. 114,

ACCOUNTING BY

CREDITORS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF A LOAN,

AS AMENDED.

WE PERIODICALLY

ASSESS THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS WE OWN, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE, AND COLLATERAL UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES TO DETERMINE IF THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE LESS THAN THE RELATED ASSETS CARRYING VALUES.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CARRYING VALUES AND FAIR VALUES OF FINANCE LEASES AND NOTES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, AS DETERMINED BY COLLATERAL VALUES, ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES.

55

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE USE A MEDIAN CALCULATED FROM PUBLISHED COLLATERAL VALUES FROM MULTIPLE EXTERNAL EQUIPMENT APPRAISERS BASED ON

THE TYPE AND AGE OF THE AIRCRAFT TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF AIRCRAFT. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WE APPLY JUDGMENT BASED ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT, USUALLY WHEN THE FEATURES OR USE OF THE AIRCRAFT VARY

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE MORE GENERIC AIRCRAFT ATTRIBUTES COVERED BY OUTSIDE PUBLICATIONS.

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE (AND NO LESS THAN ANNUALLY), WE REVIEW THE CARRYING VALUE OF ALL AIRCRAFT AND EQUIPMENT

UNDER OPERATING LEASE AND HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. IN 2004, WE REVIEWED ALL AIRCRAFT AND EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASE AND HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE. WE EVALUATE ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR HELD FOR RE-LEASE FOR

IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. WE USE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS WHEN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW. THESE ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE EXPECTED FUTURE LEASE

RATES, LEASE TERMS, END OF ECONOMIC LIFE VALUE OF THE AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT, PERIODS IN WHICH THE ASSET MAY BE HELD IN PREPARATION FOR A FOLLOW-ON LEASE, MAINTENANCE COSTS, REMARKETING COSTS AND THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSET. WE STATE

ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING VALUE OR FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL.

WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE RECORDED IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE LESS ASSET VALUE GUARANTEES, IF APPLICABLE, OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. FOR

AIRCRAFT ASSETS, WE USE A MEDIAN CALCULATED FROM THE PUBLISHED FAIR VALUES FROM MULTIPLE EXTERNAL EQUIPMENT APPRAISERS BASED ON THE TYPE AND AGE OF THE ASSET TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE. HOWEVER, IF THE FEATURES OR USE OF THE AIRCRAFT VARIES

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE GENERIC AIRCRAFT ATTRIBUTES COVERED BY OUTSIDE PUBLICATIONS, WE APPLY JUDGMENT BASED ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE. HAD THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE ASSETS DEEMED IMPAIRED DURING 2004 BEEN 10%

LOWER AT THE TIME EACH SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT HAD BEEN TAKEN, WE ESTIMATE THAT THE ASSETS IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $9 MILLION. WE ARE UNABLE TO PREDICT THE MAGNITUDE OR LIKELIHOOD OF ANY FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON

RECEIVABLES (VALUATION ALLOWANCE) IS USED TO PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF RECEIVABLES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE BALANCE REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE BUT UNCONFIRMED LOSSES IN THE RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO. WE

ESTIMATE OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES ON THE BASIS OF TWO COMPONENTS OF RECEIVABLES: (A) SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT, AND (B) POOLS OF RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT.

WE DETERMINE A RECEIVABLE IS IMPAIRED WHEN, BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION

AND EVENTS, IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY SUBSEQUENT RESTRUCTURINGS. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING COLLECTIBILITY

INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, A CUSTOMERS EXTENDED DELINQUENCY, REQUESTS FOR RESTRUCTURING AND FILINGS FOR BANKRUPTCY. WE DETERMINE A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE AND THE

ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL. EACH QUARTER, WE REVIEW CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS, PUBLISHED HISTORICAL CREDIT DEFAULT RATES FOR DIFFERENT RATING CATEGORIES, THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES (IF APPLICABLE) AND THIRD-PARTY AIRCRAFT VALUATIONS AS

A BASIS TO VALIDATE THE REASONABLENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ACTUAL RESULTS WILL NOT DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES AND VALUES OR THAT THE CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTORS IN THE FUTURE WILL NOT RESULT IN AN

INCREASE/DECREASE TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES.

THE

ALLOCATION FOR GENERAL PURPOSES REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF LOSSES EXISTING IN THE REMAINING RECEIVABLES CONSIDERING DELINQUENCIES, LOSS EXPERIENCE, COLLATERAL VALUES, GUARANTEES, RISK OF INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER CREDITS, PUBLISHED HISTORICAL DEFAULT

RATES FOR DIFFERENT RATING CATEGORIES, RESULTS OF PERIODIC CREDIT REVIEWS AND THE GENERAL STATE OF THE ECONOMY AND AIRLINE INDUSTRY.

56

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE GENERAL ALLOWANCE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REMAINING POOL OF RECEIVABLES (AFTER EXCLUDING

THE RECEIVABLES SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE) BY ASSESSING BOTH THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AND THE APPLICABLE CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATE. COLLATERAL EXPOSURE FOR A PARTICULAR RECEIVABLE IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE OVER THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL. A RECEIVABLE WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE NO COLLATERAL EXPOSURE.

PRIOR TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, THE COLLATERAL VALUE WAS DETERMINED BY AVERAGING COLLATERAL VALUES OBTAINED FROM THIRD-PARTY EQUIPMENT APPRAISERS INDUSTRY

DATA. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, WE BEGAN DETERMINING THE COLLATERAL VALUE BY CALCULATING THE MEDIAN OF THOSE APPRAISED VALUES. THE MEDIAN VALUE METHOD PROVIDES A BETTER WEIGHTED MEASURE OF AIRCRAFT COLLATERAL VALUES. THE APPLICABLE CUMULATIVE

DEFAULT RATE IS DETERMINED USING TWO COMPONENTS: CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS AND WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACT TERM. INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR EACH CUSTOMER IN THE PORTFOLIO. THOSE RATINGS ARE UPDATED BASED ON PUBLIC INFORMATION

AND INFORMATION OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM OUR CUSTOMERS. PRIOR TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, WE BASED THE CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATE ON THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING LIFE OF THE ENTIRE PORTFOLIO. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, WE BEGAN DETERMINING THE

CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATE FOR EACH RECEIVABLE BASED ON ITS WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING LIFE. BY MEASURING EACH RECEIVABLES WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING LIFE AS OPPOSED TO USING A PORTFOLIO AVERAGE, WE HAVE INCREASED THE OVERALL ACCURACY OF THIS

MEASUREMENT.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT

WOULD ENTITLE US TO LOOK BEYOND THE SPECIFIC COLLATERAL UNDERLYING THE RECEIVABLE FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. SHOULD THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL ASSET RESULTING FROM A DEFAULT

CONDITION BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR RECEIVABLE (CREATING A SHORTFALL CONDITION), THESE AGREEMENTS, WOULD, FOR EXAMPLE, PERMIT US TO TAKE THE ACTIONS NECESSARY TO SELL OR RETAIN CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS IN WHICH THE CUSTOMER HAS

AN EQUITY INTEREST AND USE THE PROCEEDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL.

IN

RECOGNITION OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ULTIMATE LOSS EXPERIENCE AND RELATIVELY LONG DURATION OF THE PORTFOLIO, A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF THE PORTFOLIOS CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL EXPOSURE IS CALCULATED BY VARYING THE APPLICABLE

DEFAULT RATE BY APPROXIMATELY PLUS AND MINUS 15%. THE RESULTING RANGE OF THE CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WAS APPROXIMATELY $382 MILLION TO $413 MILLION. WE ADJUSTED THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO $403 MILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2004.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

BECAUSE OUR COMPOSITION HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO VARIOUS ACQUISITIONS,

GOODWILL HAS HISTORICALLY CONSTITUTED A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR LONG-TERM ASSETS. WE ACCOUNT FOR OUR GOODWILL UNDER SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

. THIS STATEMENT REQUIRES AN IMPAIRMENT ONLY APPROACH TO ACCOUNTING FOR

GOODWILL.

THE SFAS NO. 142 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT MODEL IS A TWO-STEP

PROCESS. FIRST, IT REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF THE BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS THAT HAVE GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO THEM. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN BOOK VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO

COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. IN THIS PROCESS, A FAIR VALUE FOR GOODWILL IS ESTIMATED, BASED IN PART ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPERATIONS USED IN THE FIRST STEP, AND IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE SHORTFALL OF THE FAIR VALUE BELOW

CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. SFAS NO. 142 REQUIRES GOODWILL TO BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AT THE SAME DATE EVERY YEAR, AND WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SUCH THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT

AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. WE SELECTED APRIL 1 AS OUR ANNUAL TESTING DATE.

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. FORECASTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS

ARE BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE SALES AND OPERATING COSTS, BASED PRIMARILY ON EXISTING FIRM ORDERS, EXPECTED FUTURE ORDERS, CONTRACTS WITH SUPPLIERS, LABOR AGREEMENTS, AND GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, AND ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY

OUR SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND BOD. CHANGES IN THESE FORECASTS COULD CAUSE A PARTICULAR OPERATING GROUP TO EITHER PASS OR FAIL THE FIRST STEP IN THE SFAS NO. 142 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT MODEL, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT

RECORDED, IF ANY.

THE CASH FLOW FORECASTS ARE ADJUSTED BY AN APPROPRIATE

DISCOUNT RATE DERIVED FROM OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION PLUS A SUITABLE CONTROL PREMIUM AT THE DATE OF EVALUATION. THEREFORE, CHANGES IN THE STOCK PRICE MAY ALSO AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT RECORDED. AT THE DATE OF OUR PREVIOUS IMPAIRMENT TEST, A

10% INCREASE OR DECREASE IN THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK WOULD HAVE HAD NO IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

WE SPONSOR VARIOUS PENSION PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES. WE ALSO PROVIDE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE, TO ELIGIBLE RETIREES

AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS. THE LIABILITIES AND NET PERIODIC COST OF OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS ARE DETERMINED USING METHODOLOGIES THAT INVOLVE SEVERAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE

LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN, AND MEDICAL TREND (RATE OF GROWTH FOR MEDICAL COSTS). NOT ALL NET PERIODIC PENSION INCOME OR EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS IN THE YEAR INCURRED BECAUSE IT IS ALLOCATED TO PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT COSTS, AND A

PORTION REMAINS IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD.

WE USE A

DISCOUNT RATE THAT IS BASED ON A POINT-IN-TIME ESTIMATE AS OF OUR SEPTEMBER 30 ANNUAL MEASUREMENT DATE. THIS RATE IS DETERMINED BASED ON A REVIEW OF LONG-TERM, HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE AND USE OF MODELS THAT MATCH

PROJECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS OF OUR MAJOR U.S. PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS TO COUPONS AND MATURITIES FROM HIGH QUALITY BONDS. A 25 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE THE 2004 PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT

LIABILITIES BY APPROXIMATELY $1.3 BILLION (3%) AND $193 MILLION (2%), RESPECTIVELY, AND DECREASE THE 2004 NET PERIODIC PENSION EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $21 MILLION AND INCREASE OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE $4 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. A 25 BASIS POINT

DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE THE 2004 PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT LIABILITIES BY APPROXIMATELY $1.5 BILLION (4%) AND $213 MILLION (3%), RESPECTIVELY, AND INCREASE THE 2004 NET PERIODIC PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT EXPENSE

BY APPROXIMATELY $14 MILLION AND $1 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

NET PERIODIC

PENSION COSTS INCLUDE AN UNDERLYING EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN. IN DEVELOPING THIS ASSUMPTION, WE LOOK AT A NUMBER OF FACTORS, INCLUDING ASSET CLASS RETURN BY SEVERAL OF OUR TRUST FUND INVESTMENT ADVISORS, LONG-TERM INFLATION

ASSUMPTIONS, AND LONG-TERM HISTORICAL RETURNS FOR OUR PLANS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN IS BASED ON A DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO INCLUDING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, FIXED INCOME, REAL ESTATE, PRIVATE EQUITIES AND UNCORRELATED

ASSETS. PENSION INCOME OR EXPENSE IS ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN. AN INCREASE OR DECREASE OF 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED 2004 PENSION

INCOME BY APPROXIMATELY $85 MILLION.

NET PERIODIC COSTS FOR OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS INCLUDE AN ASSUMPTION OF THE MEDICAL COST TREND. TO DETERMINE THE MEDICAL TREND WE LOOK AT A COMBINATION OF INFORMATION INCLUDING OUR FUTURE EXPECTED MEDICAL COSTS, RECENT MEDICAL COSTS OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, AND GENERAL

EXPECTATIONS IN THE INDUSTRY. THE 2004 POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR NON-PENSION PLANS REFLECTS A SMALL DECREASE IN MEDICAL TREND COMPARED TO THE EXPECTED 2004 MEDICAL TREND USED IN THE 2003 MEASUREMENT. RECENT GAINS DUE TO

LOWER-THAN-EXPECTED INCREASES IN MEDICAL CLAIMS COSTS HAVE CREATED AN UNRECOGNIZED GAIN IN 2004.

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE ASSUMED MEDICAL COST TREND RATES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR THE HEALTH CARE PLANS. A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ASSUMED MEDICAL COST

TREND RATES WOULD INCREASE THE 2004 OTHER POSTRETIREMENT LIABILITIES BY APPROXIMATELY $727 MILLION. A 100 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN ASSUMED MEDICAL COST TREND RATES WOULD DECREASE THE 2004 OTHER POSTRETIREMENT LIABILITIES BY APPROXIMATELY $628

MILLION. A 100 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN ASSUMED MEDICAL COST TREND RATES WOULD INCREASE THE 2004 OTHER POSTRETIREMENT COSTS BY APPROXIMATELY $71 MILLION. A 100 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES WOULD DECREASE THE 2004 OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT COSTS BY APPROXIMATELY $61 MILLION.

STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET

IMPLEMENTED

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 151,

INVENTORY COSTS  AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 43

. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES ABNORMAL AMOUNTS OF IDLE FACILITY EXPENSE, FREIGHT, HANDLING COSTS, AND WASTED MATERIAL (SPOILAGE) TO BE RECOGNIZED AS CURRENT PERIOD CHARGES. ADDITIONALLY, IT REQUIRES

THAT ALLOCATION OF FIXED PRODUCTION OVERHEAD COSTS BE ALLOCATED TO INVENTORY BASED ON THE NORMAL CAPACITY OF THE PRODUCTION FACILITY. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS STANDARD APPLY PROSPECTIVELY AND ARE EFFECTIVE FOR US FOR INVENTORY COSTS INCURRED AFTER

JANUARY 1, 2006. WHILE WE BELIEVE THIS STANDARD WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THESE NEW RULES IS DEPENDENT ON EVENTS THAT COULD OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND AS SUCH, AN ESTIMATE OF THE IMPACT

CANNOT BE DETERMINED UNTIL THE EVENT OCCURS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

IN

DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004) (SFAS NO. 123R),

SHARED-BASED PAYMENT

. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES COMPANIES TO MEASURE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS AT GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE AND RECOGNIZE THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN THEIR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WHILE WE PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK BASED COMPENSATION

, SFAS NO. 123R CHANGES OUR METHOD OF MEASURING COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR OUR

PERFORMANCE SHARES FROM MARKET PRICE TO FAIR VALUE AT GRANT DATE AND REQUIRES A FORFEITURE ASSUMPTION FOR OUR UNVESTED AWARDS. ADDITIONALLY, SFAS NO. 123R AMENDS THE PRESENTATION OF THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND REQUIRES ADDITIONAL ANNUAL

DISCLOSURES. WE WILL EARLY ADOPT THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123R AS OF JANUARY 1, 2005 USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE METHOD. WE BELIEVE THE IMPACT OF APPLYING AN ESTIMATED FORFEITURE ASSUMPTION TO OUR UNVESTED AWARDS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CONTINGENT ITEMS

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS, CONTRACTS

AND OTHER MATTERS ARE PENDING AGAINST US. MOST SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO MATTERS COVERED BY OUR INSURANCE. MAJOR CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE ALLEGED POSSESSION AND MISUSE OF THIRD-PARTY

PROPRIETARY DATA, FROM WHICH CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT OR HAVE RESULTED. SUCH PROCEEDINGS INVOLVE, OR COULD INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES, COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION AND/OR

FORFEITURES. UNDER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, A COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS OPERATING DIVISIONS OR SUBDIVISIONS, CAN ALSO BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, OR LOSE ITS EXPORT PRIVILEGES, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS. WE

ARE ALSO A DEFENDANT IN SUITS FILED BY LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION, ICO GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS, LTD. AND SEVERAL OF OUR EMPLOYEES. WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON CURRENT INFORMATION, THAT THE OUTCOME OF THESE DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH IN NOTE 23 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THOSE FOR DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND REMEDIATION OF

CONTAMINATED SITES DISCUSSED. SUCH REQUIREMENTS HAVE RESULTED IN OUR BEING INVOLVED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS SINCE THE 1980S.

WE ROUTINELY ASSESS, BASED ON IN-DEPTH STUDIES, EXPERT ANALYSES AND LEGAL REVIEWS, OUR CONTINGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED

SITES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RANGES AND PROBABILITIES OF RECOVERIES FROM OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO HAVE AND HAVE NOT AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT AND OF RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS. OUR POLICY IS TO IMMEDIATELY ACCRUE AND CHARGE TO CURRENT

EXPENSE IDENTIFIED EXPOSURES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SITES BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE WITHIN A RANGE OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURE FOR INVESTIGATION, CLEANUP AND MONITORING COSTS TO BE INCURRED.

THE COSTS INCURRED AND EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACTIVITIES HAVE

NOT HAD, AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US. WITH RESPECT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, RELATED CHARGES HAVE AVERAGED LESS THAN 1% OF HISTORICAL ANNUAL REVENUES. ALTHOUGH NOT CONSIDERED LIKELY, SHOULD WE BE REQUIRED TO INCUR

REMEDIATION CHARGES AT THE HIGH LEVEL OF THE RANGE OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURE, THE ADDITIONAL CHARGES WOULD BE LESS THAN 3% OF HISTORICAL ANNUAL REVENUES.

BECAUSE OF THE REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES AND RISK OF UNIDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED SITES AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS TO BE

MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTIMATED COSTS ACCRUED FOR IDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED SITES. HOWEVER, BASED ON ALL KNOWN FACTS AND EXPERT ANALYSES, WE BELIEVE IT IS NOT REASONABLY LIKELY THAT IDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES WILL RESULT IN

ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOW TRENDS.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND SURETY BONDS WITH FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRIMARILY RELATING TO THE GUARANTEE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE ON

CERTAIN CONTRACTS. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ON OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND SURETY BONDS AGGREGATED APPROXIMATELY $3.2 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND APPROXIMATELY $2.4 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE RISK

WE HAVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK, PRINCIPALLY SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, FIXED-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, AND CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED MATERIAL GAINS OR LOSSES DUE TO INTEREST RATE

CHANGES. ADDITIONALLY, WE USE INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

BASED ON THE CURRENT HOLDINGS OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS RELATED SWAPS, THE UNHEDGED EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IS NOT MATERIAL FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS. THE INVESTORS IN THE FIXED-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS THAT WE

ISSUE, GENERALLY DO NOT HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEMAND WE PAY OFF THESE OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO MATURITY. THEREFORE, EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IS NOT BELIEVED TO BE MATERIAL FOR OUR FIXED-RATE DEBT.

BCCS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, BOTH FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE, MAY BE SUBJECT TO

INTEREST RATE RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE MATURITIES AND REPRICING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LIABILITIES DO NOT PERFECTLY MATCH THOSE OF THE ASSETS. THE TYPES AND TERMS OF BORROWING AND HEDGING INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE TO BCC IN THE MARKET AND

POSSIBLE CHANGES IN ASSET TERMS LIMIT BCCS ABILITY TO MATCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. BCC ATTEMPTS TO MINIMIZE THIS RISK, PARTLY THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS, AND DOES NOT BELIEVE IT IS MATERIALLY EXPOSED TO GAINS OR LOSSES DUE TO

INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

BCC HAS USED PUBLIC MARKET INFORMATION AND COMMON

VALUATION METHODS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE ESTIMATES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE AMOUNTS BCC COULD REALIZE IN A CURRENT MARKET EXCHANGE, AND THE USE OF DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR VALUATION METHODS COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS.

AT DECEMBER

31, 2004, THE BOOK VALUES OF BCCS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY $10.3 BILLION AND $8.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. BCC MEASURES AND MANAGES ITS INTEREST RATE RISK BY ESTIMATING THE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN TWELVE-MONTH NET INTEREST INCOME

AND IN THE CURRENT DISCOUNTED VALUE OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BASED ON THE CASH FLOWS PROJECTED FROM EACH. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE ESTIMATED THAT IF MARKET INTEREST RATES FOR ALL MATURITIES WERE AFFECTED BY AN IMMEDIATE, ONE-TIME,

100-BASIS-POINT INCREASE, BCCS NET EARNINGS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INCREASES IN BOTH REVENUE AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WOULD HAVE CHANGED BY AN AMOUNT THAT IS IMMATERIAL TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, ALTHOUGH THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

IMPACTED BY A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES ARE GENERALLY NOT TRADED, BCC ESTIMATED THAT THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WOULD HAVE CHANGED BY AN AMOUNT THAT IS IMMATERIAL TO ITS FINANCIAL POSITION.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK RELATING TO RECEIPTS FROM

CUSTOMERS AND PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FIRMLY COMMITTED AND FORECASTED FOREIGN DENOMINATED PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS RELATED TO OUR ONGOING BUSINESS

AND OPERATIONAL FINANCING ACTIVITIES. FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, A 10% UNFAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENT IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD

HAVE RESULTED IN AN INCREMENTAL UNREALIZED LOSS OF $60.0 MILLION. CONSISTENT WITH THE USE OF THESE CONTRACTS TO NEUTRALIZE THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, SUCH UNREALIZED LOSSES OR GAINS WOULD BE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING GAINS OR LOSSES,

RESPECTIVELY, IN THE REMEASUREMENT OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED. WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE OFFSETTING UNDERLYING COMMITMENTS DO NOT CREATE MATERIAL MARKET RISK.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

WE ARE SUBJECT TO COMMODITY PRICE RISK RELATING PRINCIPALLY TO ENERGY USED IN PRODUCTION. WE PERIODICALLY USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES,

SUCH AS FIXED-PRICE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, TO HEDGE AGAINST POTENTIALLY UNFAVORABLE PRICE CHANGES OF COMMODITIES. COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURE RELATED TO UNHEDGED CONTRACTS IS NOT MATERIAL.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003, 2002

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF ALL MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE CONSOLIDATED.

INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES FOR WHICH WE DO NOT HAVE CONTROL OR ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY, BUT HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE OPERATING AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD.

ACCORDINGLY, OUR SHARE OF NET EARNINGS AND LOSSES FROM THESE VENTURES IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. INTRACOMPANY PROFITS, TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE

BEEN MADE TO PRIOR PERIODS TO CONFORM WITH CURRENT REPORTING. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 26, THE PRESENTATION OF OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS HAS BEEN ADJUSTED FOR THE RECLASSIFICATION OF CUSTOMER FINANCING TRANSACTIONS ASSOCIATED WITH BOEING

CAPITAL CORPORATION (BCC). THE ORIGINATION AND SUBSEQUENT PRINCIPAL COLLECTIONS FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED AS INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS, CONSISTENT WITH THE PRESENTATION BY BCC IN THEIR

STAND-ALONE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE AMOUNTS FOR PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED

IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES FOR WHICH CHANGES IN THE NEAR TERM ARE CONSIDERED REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THESE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OPERATING CYCLE

FOR CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WE ELECTED TO USE THE DURATION

OF THE RELATED CONTRACT AS OUR OPERATING CYCLE WHICH IS GENERALLY LONGER THAN ONE YEAR.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING

CONTRACT

ACCOUNTING IS USED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES PREDOMINATELY BY THE AIRCRAFT AND WEAPONS SYSTEMS (A&WS), NETWORK SYSTEMS, SUPPORT SYSTEMS, AND LAUNCH AND ORBITAL SYSTEMS (L&OS) SEGMENTS WITHIN INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS (IDS).

THESE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS AND SYSTEMS: MILITARY AIRCRAFT, HELICOPTERS, MISSILES, SPACE SYSTEMS, MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS, SATELLITES, ROCKET ENGINES, AND INFORMATION AND BATTLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. THE MAJORITY OF BUSINESS

CONDUCTED IN THESE SEGMENTS IS PERFORMED UNDER CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS THAT EXTEND OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS. CONTRACT ACCOUNTING INVOLVES A JUDGMENTAL PROCESS OF ESTIMATING THE TOTAL SALES AND COSTS FOR EACH

CONTRACT, WHICH RESULTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES. FOR EACH SALE CONTRACT, THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED.

SALES RELATED TO CONTRACTS WITH FIXED PRICES ARE RECOGNIZED AS

DELIVERIES ARE MADE, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD BEFORE DELIVERIES BEGIN, FOR WHICH SALES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE MILESTONES. SALES RELATED TO

CONTRACTS IN WHICH WE ARE REIMBURSED FOR COSTS INCURRED PLUS AN AGREED UPON PROFIT ARE RECORDED AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. THE MAJORITY OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE FEDERAL

67

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ACQUISITION REGULATIONS PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE TYPES OF COST THAT WILL BE REIMBURSED IN ESTABLISHING CONTRACT PRICE. CONTRACTS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS TO EARN

INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES IF TARGETS ARE ACHIEVED. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED ARE RECORDED OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD OF THE CONTRACT. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED ARE RECORDED WHEN

AWARDED.

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

WE USE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING TO ACCOUNT

FOR SALES AND COST OF SALES RELATED TO ALL OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAMS BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT. PROGRAM ACCOUNTING IS A METHOD OF ACCOUNTING APPLICABLE TO PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED FOR DELIVERY UNDER PRODUCTION-TYPE CONTRACTS WHERE

PROFITABILITY IS REALIZED OVER MULTIPLE CONTRACTS AND YEARS. UNDER PROGRAM ACCOUNTING, INVENTORIABLE PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS AND WARRANTY COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED AND CHARGED AS COST OF SALES BY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF BY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR

CONTRACTS. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP OF

SALES TO COST OF SALES, PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF (A) THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN A PROGRAM, (B) THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE UNITS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED, AND (C) THE UNITS EXPECTED SALES

PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING, AND WARRANTY COSTS FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM.

WE RECOGNIZE SALES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DELIVERIES AS EACH UNIT IS COMPLETED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. SALES RECOGNIZED REPRESENT THE PRICE NEGOTIATED WITH THE CUSTOMER, ADJUSTED BY AN ESCALATION FORMULA. THE AMOUNT

REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE FOR THE TOTAL REMAINING PROGRAM TO THE AMOUNT OF SALES RECOGNIZED FOR AIRPLANES DELIVERED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER.

SERVICE REVENUE

SERVICE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED.

THIS METHOD IS PREDOMINATELY USED BY OUR SUPPORT SYSTEMS, L&OS AND COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENTS. SERVICE ACTIVITIES INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: DELTA LAUNCHES, ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, SPACE SHUTTLE AND EXPLOSIVE DETECTION

SYSTEMS, SUPPORT AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND HELICOPTER CONTRACTS AND TECHNICAL AND FLIGHT OPERATION SERVICES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. BCC LEASE AND FINANCING REVENUE IS ALSO INCLUDED IN SERVICE REVENUE ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. SEE THE LEASE AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS SECTION BELOW FOR A DISCUSSION OF BCCS REVENUE RECOGNITION POLICIES.

LEASE AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS

LEASE AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS ARE USED PREDOMINATELY BY BCC, OUR WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY,

AND CONSIST OF SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES, OPERATING LEASES AND NOTES RECEIVABLE. REVENUE AND INTEREST INCOME ARE RECOGNIZED FOR OUR VARIOUS TYPES OF LEASES AND NOTES RECEIVABLE AS FOLLOWS.

SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES

AT LEASE INCEPTION, WE RECORD AN ASSET (NET

INVESTMENT) REPRESENTING THE AGGREGATE FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS, ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OF THE LEASED EQUIPMENT AND UNEARNED INCOME. INCOME IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE LEASE TO APPROXIMATE A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN ON THE NET

INVESTMENT. RESIDUAL VALUES, WHICH ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY, REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE AT LEASE TERMINATION FROM THE DISPOSITION OF LEASED EQUIPMENT. ACTUAL RESIDUAL VALUES REALIZED COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES.

OPERATING LEASES

REVENUE ON THE LEASED AIRCRAFT AND EQUIPMENT

REPRESENTING RENTAL FEES AND FINANCING CHARGES IS RECORDED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE.

NOTES RECEIVABLE

AT COMMENCEMENT OF A NOTE RECEIVABLE ISSUED FOR THE PURCHASE OF AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT, WE RECORD THE NOTE AND ANY UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNTS. INTEREST INCOME AND AMORTIZATION OF ANY

DISCOUNTS ARE RECORDED RATABLY OVER THE RELATED TERM OF THE NOTE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INCLUDES COSTS INCURRED FOR EXPERIMENTATION, DESIGN AND TESTING AND ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED UNLESS THE COSTS ARE RELATED TO CERTAIN

CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS. COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED PURSUANT TO SUCH CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE RECORDED OVER THE PERIOD THAT REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED, CONSISTENT WITH OUR CONTRACT ACCOUNTING POLICY.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE HAVE ESTABLISHED COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS

WITH SOME SUPPLIERS FOR THE 787 THAT WILL ENHANCE OUR INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT CAPABILITIES AND OFFSET A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THE FINANCIAL RISK OF DEVELOPING THE 787 PRODUCT. OUR COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS EXPLICITLY STATE THAT THE SUPPLIER

CONTRIBUTIONS ARE FOR REIMBURSEMENTS OF COSTS WE INCUR FOR EXPERIMENTATION, BASIC DESIGN AND TESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 787. IN EACH ARRANGEMENT, WE WILL RETAIN SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS TO THE 787 PART OR COMPONENT COVERED BY THE

ARRANGEMENT.

PURSUANT TO STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

(SFAS) NO. 68,

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS

, WE HAVE RECORDED THE AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM THESE COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS AS A REDUCTION TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES. SPECIFICALLY, UNDER THE TERMS OF EACH AGREEMENT, PAYMENTS

RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS FOR THEIR SHARE OF THE COSTS WILL BE TYPICALLY BASED ON MILESTONES AND WILL BE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED WHEN WE ACHIEVE THE MILESTONE EVENTS AND NO ONGOING OBLIGATION ON OUR PART EXISTS. IN THE EVENT WE RECEIVE A MILESTONE

PAYMENT PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF THE MILESTONE THE AMOUNT WILL BE CLASSIFIED AS LIABILITY UNTIL EARNED.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

WE USE A FAIR

VALUE BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION PROVIDED TO OUR EMPLOYEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 17. OUR PRIMARY TYPES OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION CONSIST

OF STOCK OPTIONS, SHAREVALUE TRUST DISTRIBUTIONS AND PERFORMANCE SHARES. WE VALUE STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED BASED UPON AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL AND RECOGNIZE THIS FAIR VALUE AS AN EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE OPTIONS SERVICE PERIOD. POTENTIAL

DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE SHAREVALUE TRUST HAVE BEEN VALUED BASED UPON AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL, WITH THE RELATED EXPENSE RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRUST. SHARE-BASED EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMANCE SHARES IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE MARKET

VALUE OF OUR STOCK AT THE TIME OF THE AWARD APPLIED TO THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF SHARES CONTINGENTLY ISSUABLE BASED ON STOCK PRICE, AND IS AMORTIZED OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.

INCOME TAXES

PROVISIONS FOR FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES ARE CALCULATED ON REPORTED PRE-TAX EARNINGS BASED ON CURRENT TAX LAW AND ALSO INCLUDE, IN THE CURRENT PERIOD,

THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ANY CHANGES IN TAX RATES FROM THOSE USED PREVIOUSLY IN DETERMINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. SUCH PROVISIONS DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNTS CURRENTLY RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE BECAUSE CERTAIN ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE

RECOGNIZED IN DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES THAN FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND EVALUATING TAX POSITIONS. WE ESTABLISH RESERVES FOR INCOME TAX WHEN,

DESPITE THE BELIEF THAT OUR TAX POSITIONS ARE FULLY SUPPORTABLE, THERE REMAIN CERTAIN POSITIONS THAT ARE PROBABLE TO BE CHALLENGED AND POSSIBLY DISALLOWED BY VARIOUS AUTHORITIES. THE CONSOLIDATED TAX PROVISION AND RELATED ACCRUALS INCLUDE THE IMPACT

OF SUCH REASONABLY ESTIMABLE LOSSES AND RELATED INTEREST AS DEEMED APPROPRIATE. TO THE EXTENT THAT THE PROBABLE TAX OUTCOME OF THESE MATTERS CHANGES, SUCH CHANGES IN ESTIMATE WILL IMPACT THE INCOME TAX PROVISION IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH SUCH

DETERMINATION IS MADE.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

WE SPONSOR VARIOUS PENSION PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES. WE ALSO PROVIDE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF

HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS. BENEFITS UNDER THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AGE AT RETIREMENT AND YEARS OF SERVICE AND FOR SOME PENSION PLANS BENEFITS ARE ALSO BASED

ON THE EMPLOYEES ANNUAL EARNINGS. THE NET PERIODIC COST OF OUR PENSION AND OTHER POST-RETIREMENT PLANS IS DETERMINED USING THE PROJECTED UNIT CREDIT METHOD AND SEVERAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE,

THE LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN, AND MEDICAL TREND (RATE OF GROWTH FOR MEDICAL COSTS). NOT ALL NET PERIODIC PENSION INCOME OR EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS IN THE YEAR INCURRED BECAUSE IT IS ALLOCATED TO PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT COSTS, AND A

PORTION REMAINS IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD. WE AMORTIZE GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH OCCUR WHEN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE DIFFERS FROM ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD OF EMPLOYEES. OUR FUNDING POLICY FOR PENSION

PLANS IS TO CONTRIBUTE, AT A MINIMUM, THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED AMOUNT.

CASH AND CASH

EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF HIGHLY LIQUID

INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, TIME DEPOSITS, AND OTHER MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS, WHICH HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF LESS THAN THREE MONTHS. WE AGGREGATE OUR CASH BALANCES BY BANK, AND RECLASSIFY ANY NEGATIVE BALANCES TO A LIABILITY

ACCOUNT PRESENTED AS A COMPONENT OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIED COSTS ON COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTS INCLUDE

DIRECT ENGINEERING, PRODUCTION AND TOOLING COSTS, AND APPLICABLE OVERHEAD, WHICH INCLUDES FRINGE BENEFITS, PRODUCTION RELATED INDIRECT AND PLANT MANAGEMENT SALARIES AND PLANT SERVICES, NOT IN EXCESS OF ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE. IN ACCORDANCE

WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE, INVENTORIED COSTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS RELATING TO PROGRAMS AND CONTRACTS WITH LONG PRODUCTION CYCLES, A PORTION OF WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED WITHIN ONE YEAR.

BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW

AIRPLANE PROGRAM (KNOWN AS THE LEARNING CURVE EFFECT), THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED FOR PRODUCTION OF THE EARLY UNITS IN THE PROGRAM WILL EXCEED THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES FOR THOSE UNITS. THE EXCESS OR ACTUAL COSTS OVER THE

AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS PRESENTED AS DEFERRED PRODUCTION COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORY ALONG WITH UNAMORTIZED TOOLING COSTS.

USED AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT, COMMERCIAL SPARE PARTS, AND GENERAL STOCK MATERIALS ARE STATED AT COST NOT IN EXCESS OF NET REALIZABLE

VALUE.

ASSETS OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS

ASSETS TO BE DISPOSED OF THAT MEET ALL OF THE CRITERIA TO BE CLASSIFIED AS HELD FOR

SALE AS SET FORTH IN SFAS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS

, ARE REPORTED AT THE LOWER OF THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS OR FAIR VALUES LESS COST TO SELL. ASSETS ARE NOT DEPRECIATED WHILE THEY ARE CLASSIFIED AS

HELD FOR SALE. ASSETS HELD FOR SALE THAT HAVE OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS THAT CAN BE CLEARLY DISTINGUISHED, OPERATIONALLY AND FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES, FROM THE REST OF OUR ASSETS ARE REPORTED IN DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS WHEN (A) IT IS

DETERMINED THAT THE OPERATIONS AND CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSETS WILL BE ELIMINATED FROM OUR ON-GOING OPERATIONS AND (B) WE WILL NOT HAVE ANY SIGNIFICANT CONTINUING INVOLVEMENT IN THE OPERATIONS OF THE ASSETS AFTER THE DISPOSAL TRANSACTION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT (INCLUDING OPERATING LEASE EQUIPMENT)

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST, INCLUDING APPLICABLE

CONSTRUCTION-PERIOD INTEREST, LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND ARE DEPRECIATED PRINCIPALLY OVER THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES: NEW BUILDINGS AND LAND IMPROVEMENTS, FROM 10 TO 40 YEARS; AND NEW MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, FROM 3 TO 20 YEARS. THE

PRINCIPAL METHODS OF DEPRECIATION ARE AS FOLLOWS: BUILDINGS AND LAND IMPROVEMENTS, 150% DECLINING BALANCE; AND MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF REMAINING DEPRECIABLE LIVES

ASSIGNED TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS SUBJECT TO A MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR DISPOSITION. AIRCRAFT FINANCING OPERATING LEASE EQUIPMENT IS RECORDED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE OR PROJECTED ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE EQUIPMENT, PRIMARILY ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS, TO AN ESTIMATED RESIDUAL OR SALVAGE VALUE.

WE

REVIEW LONG-LIVED ASSETS, WHICH INCLUDES PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND OPERATING LEASE EQUIPMENT, FOR IMPAIRMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144. LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR SALE ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO SELL.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR USE ARE SUBJECT TO AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS NO LONGER RECOVERABLE BASED UPON THE UNDISCOUNTED

FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

INVESTMENTS

WE CLASSIFY INVESTMENTS AS EITHER OPERATING OR NON-OPERATING. OPERATING INVESTMENTS ARE STRATEGIC IN NATURE, WHICH MEANS THEY ARE INTEGRAL COMPONENTS OF OUR OPERATIONS. NON-OPERATING INVESTMENTS ARE THOSE WE HOLD FOR

NON-STRATEGIC PURPOSES. EARNINGS FROM OPERATING INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING OUR SHARE OF INCOME OR LOSS FROM CERTAIN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, INCOME FROM COST METHOD INVESTMENTS, AND ANY GAIN/LOSS ON THE DISPOSITION OF INVESTMENTS, ARE RECORDED IN

INCOME/(LOSS) FROM OPERATING INVESTMENTS, NET. EARNINGS FROM NON-OPERATING INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES, ARE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME, NET ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

CERTAIN INVESTMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS NO. 115,

ACCOUNTING

FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY

SECURITIES

. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES INCLUDE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND ENHANCED EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES (EETCS). AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED AT THEIR FAIR VALUES AND

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED AS PART OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 12, PRIOR TO THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004, HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES

INCLUDED EETCS AND DEBENTURES FOR WHICH WE HAD THE POSITIVE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY. HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES WERE REPORTED AT AMORTIZED COST. WE MAY TRANSFER HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES TO AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES WHEN THERE

ARE CHANGES IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, AS PERMITTED BY SFAS NO. 115, OR WHEN OTHER EVENTS THAT ARE ISOLATED, NONRECURRING AND UNUSUAL OCCUR WITHOUT REQUIRING OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OF HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES TO BE TRANSFERRED TO AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE.

HOWEVER, IF WE DO NOT MEET THE CIRCUMSTANCES PERMITTED BY SFAS NO. 115, OUR ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OF HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES ARE TRANSFERRED TO AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CONTINUALLY ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT. TO DETERMINE IF AN

IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER THAN TEMPORARY WE CONSIDER THE DURATION OF THE LOSS POSITION, THE STRENGTH OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL, THE DURATION TO MATURITY, CREDIT REVIEWS AND ANALYSES OF THE COUNTER-PARTIES. OTHER THAN TEMPORARY LOSSES ON OPERATING

INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED IN COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND OTHER THAN TEMPORARY LOSSES ON NON-OPERATING INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME, NET.

GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

, WHICH WE ADOPTED ON JANUARY 1, 2002, THE ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS CHANGED FROM AN

71

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AMORTIZATION APPROACH TO AN IMPAIRMENT-ONLY APPROACH. THE SFAS NO. 142 GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT MODEL IS A TWO-STEP PROCESS. FIRST, IT REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF THE BOOK

VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS THAT HAVE GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO THEM. WE ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. THE CASH FLOW FORECASTS ARE ADJUSTED BY AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT

RATE DERIVED FROM OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION PLUS A SUITABLE CONTROL PREMIUM AT THE DATE OF EVALUATION. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN BOOK VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. IN THIS PROCESS, A

FAIR VALUE FOR GOODWILL IS ESTIMATED, BASED IN PART ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPERATIONS USED IN THE FIRST STEP, AND IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE SHORTFALL OF THE FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.

SFAS NO. 142 REQUIRES GOODWILL TO BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AT THE SAME DATE EVERY YEAR, AND WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SUCH THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. OUR ANNUAL TESTING DATE IS APRIL 1.

OUR FINITE-LIVED ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED ON A

STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD AND INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY, 5 TO 12 YEARS; PRODUCT KNOW-HOW, 30 YEARS; CUSTOMER BASE, 10 TO 15 YEARS; AND OTHER, 5 TO 17 YEARS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144, WE EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF

FINITE-LIVED ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHEN APPROPRIATE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS NO LONGER RECOVERABLE BASED UPON THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

DERIVATIVES

WE ACCOUNT FOR DERIVATIVES PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

, AS AMENDED. ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE REGARDLESS OF THE PURPOSE OR INTENT FOR HOLDING THEM. WE RECORD OUR INTEREST RATE AND FOREIGN

CURRENCY SWAPS AT FAIR VALUE BASED ON DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS AND FOR WARRANTS AND OTHER OPTION TYPE INSTRUMENTS BASED ON OPTION PRICING MODELS. FOR DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED

ASSET OR LIABILITY OR A FIRM COMMITMENT (REFERRED TO AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES), THE GAIN OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE OFFSETTING LOSS OR GAIN ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. THE

EFFECT OF THAT ACCOUNTING IS TO REFLECT IN EARNINGS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HEDGE IS NOT EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE. FOR OUR CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE DERIVATIVES GAIN OR LOSS IS INITIALLY

REPORTED IN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/LOSS) AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS IS REPORTED IN EARNINGS IMMEDIATELY. WE ALSO HOLD

CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS FOR ECONOMIC PURPOSES THAT DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. FOR THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AS WELL AS OTHER DERIVATIVES NOT RECEIVING HEDGE TREATMENT THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS.

AIRCRAFT VALUATION

USED AIRCRAFT UNDER TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS AND AIRCRAFT UNDER REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNING A DEFINITIVE

AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF NEW AIRCRAFT (SALE AIRCRAFT), WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SPECIFIED-PRICE TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO TRADE IN USED AIRCRAFT UPON THE PURCHASE OF SALE AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE

ENTERED INTO CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS WHEREIN WE AGREE TO REPURCHASE THE SALE AIRCRAFT AT A SPECIFIED PRICE, GENERALLY TEN YEARS AFTER DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT. OUR REPURCHASE OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT IS CONTINGENT

UPON A FUTURE, MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT. IF, IN THE FUTURE, WE EXECUTE AN AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT, AND IF THE CUSTOMER EXERCISES ITS RIGHT TO SELL THE SALE AIRCRAFT TO US, A

CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENT WOULD BECOME A TRADE-IN COMMITMENT. BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, WE BELIEVE THAT VERY FEW, IF ANY, OF OUR OUTSTANDING CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS. EXPOSURE

RELATED TO THE TRADE-IN OF USED AIRCRAFT RESULTING FROM TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS MAY TAKE THE FORM OF: (1) ADJUSTMENTS TO REVENUE RELATED TO THE SALE OF NEW AIRCRAFT DETERMINED AT THE SIGNING OF A

72

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT, AND/OR (2) CHARGES TO COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RELATED TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT THAT OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO

SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR NEW AIRCRAFT BUT PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE OF THE USED TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT. THE TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT EXPOSURE RELATED TO ITEM (2) IS INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION.

OBLIGATIONS RELATED TO PROBABLE

TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS ARE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROSS AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO CUSTOMERS AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL. THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL IS DETERMINED USING AIRCRAFT SPECIFIC DATA SUCH AS, MODEL, AGE AND CONDITION,

MARKET CONDITIONS FOR SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT AND SIMILAR MODELS, AND MULTIPLE VALUATION SOURCES. THIS PROCESS USES OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE MARKET FOR EACH TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT, WHICH IN MOST INSTANCES BEGINS YEARS BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE AIRCRAFT. THERE ARE

SEVERAL POSSIBLE MARKETS IN WHICH WE CONTINUALLY PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO PLACE USED AIRCRAFT. THESE MARKETS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, (1) THE RESALE MARKET, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY INCLUDE THE COST OF LONG-TERM STORAGE, (2) THE LEASING

MARKET, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR REFURBISHMENT COSTS TO MEET THE LEASING CUSTOMERS REQUIREMENTS, OR (3) THE SCRAP MARKET. COLLATERAL VALUATION VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON WHICH MARKET WE DETERMINE IS MOST LIKELY FOR EACH AIRCRAFT. ON A

QUARTERLY BASIS, WE UPDATE OUR VALUATION ANALYSIS BASED ON THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH PLACING EACH AIRCRAFT INTO A MARKET. THIS QUARTERLY COLLATERAL VALUATION PROCESS YIELDS RESULTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY LOWER THAN RESIDUAL VALUE ESTIMATES

BY INDEPENDENT SOURCES AND TENDS TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT RESULTS UPON THE ACTUAL PLACEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT.

USED AIRCRAFT ACQUIRED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET AS IT IS OUR INTENT TO SELL THESE ASSETS. TO MITIGATE COSTS AND ENHANCE

MARKETABILITY, AIRCRAFT MAY BE PLACED ON OPERATING LEASE. WHILE ON OPERATING LEASE, THE ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER FINANCING, HOWEVER, THE VALUATION CONTINUES TO BE BASED ON THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET

ASSESSMENT IS PERFORMED QUARTERLY USING THE PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE.

ASSET VALUATION FOR EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASE, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE AND COLLATERAL UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES

INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER FINANCING ARE OPERATING LEASE EQUIPMENT, NOTES RECEIVABLES AND

SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES. SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES ARE TREATED AS RECEIVABLES, AND ALLOWANCES ARE ESTABLISHED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 13,

ACCOUNTING FOR LEASES

AND SFAS NO. 118,

ACCOUNTING BY CREDITORS FOR IMPAIRMENT OF A LOAN,

AS AMENDED.

WE PERIODICALLY ASSESS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS WE

OWN, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE AND COLLATERAL UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES, TO DETERMINE IF THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE LESS THAN THE RELATED ASSETS CARRYING VALUES. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CARRYING VALUES

AND FAIR VALUES OF FINANCE LEASES AND NOTES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, AS DETERMINED BY COLLATERAL VALUE, ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES.

WE USE A MEDIAN CALCULATED FROM PUBLISHED COLLATERAL VALUES FROM MULTIPLE EXTERNAL EQUIPMENT APPRAISERS BASED ON THE TYPE AND AGE OF

THE AIRCRAFT TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF AIRCRAFT.

UNDER CERTAIN

CIRCUMSTANCES, WE APPLY JUDGMENT BASED ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT, USUALLY WHEN THE FEATURES OR USE OF THE AIRCRAFT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE MORE GENERIC AIRCRAFT ATTRIBUTES COVERED BY OUTSIDE PUBLICATIONS.

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND HELD

FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE

WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE (AND NO LESS THAN ANNUALLY), WE REVIEW THE CARRYING VALUE OF ALL AIRCRAFT AND EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASE AND HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT. IN 2004, WE

REVIEWED ALL AIRCRAFT AND EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASE AND HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE. WE EVALUATE ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR HELD FOR RE-LEASE FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN THE EXPECTED

73

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. WE USE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS WHEN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW.

THESE ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE EXPECTED FUTURE LEASE RATES, LEASE TERMS, END OF ECONOMIC LIFE VALUE OF THE AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT, PERIODS IN WHICH THE ASSET MAY BE HELD IN PREPARATION FOR A FOLLOW-ON LEASE, MAINTENANCE COSTS, REMARKETING COSTS AND THE

REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSET. WE STATE ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING VALUE OR FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL.

WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE RECORDED IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE LESS ASSET VALUE

GUARANTEES, IF APPLICABLE, OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET. FOR AIRCRAFT ASSETS, WE USE A MEDIAN CALCULATED FROM THE PUBLISHED FAIR VALUES FROM MULTIPLE EXTERNAL EQUIPMENT APPRAISERS BASED ON THE TYPE AND AGE OF THE ASSET TO DETERMINE THE FAIR

VALUE. HOWEVER, IF THE FEATURES OR USE OF THE AIRCRAFT VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE GENERIC AIRCRAFT ATTRIBUTES COVERED BY OUTSIDE PUBLICATIONS, WE APPLY JUDGMENT BASED ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON

RECEIVABLES IS A VALUATION ACCOUNT USED TO PROVIDE FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF RECEIVABLES IN OUR PORTFOLIO. THE BALANCE IS AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE BUT UNCONFIRMED LOSSES IN THE RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON

RECEIVABLES RELATES TO TWO COMPONENTS OF RECEIVABLES: (A) SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AND (B) POOLS OF RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT.

WE DETERMINE A RECEIVABLE IS IMPAIRED WHEN, BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION AND EVENTS, IT

IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY SUBSEQUENT RESTRUCTURINGS. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING COLLECTIBILITY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT

LIMITED TO, A CUSTOMERS EXTENDED DELINQUENCY, REQUESTS FOR RESTRUCTURING AND FILINGS FOR BANKRUPTCY. WE DETERMINE A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCE BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE

OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL. EACH QUARTER, WE REVIEW CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS, PUBLISHED HISTORICAL CREDIT DEFAULT RATES FOR DIFFERENT RATING CATEGORIES, THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES (IF APPLICABLE) AND THIRD-PARTY AIRCRAFT VALUATIONS AS A BASIS TO VALIDATE

THE REASONABLENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ACTUAL RESULTS WILL NOT DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES AND VALUES OR THAT THE CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTORS IN THE FUTURE WILL NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE/DECREASE

TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES.

THE ALLOCATION FOR GENERAL

PURPOSES REPRESENTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF LOSSES EXISTING IN THE REMAINING RECEIVABLES CONSIDERING DELINQUENCIES, LOSS EXPERIENCE, COLLATERAL VALUES, GUARANTEES, RISK OF INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER CREDITS, PUBLISHED HISTORICAL DEFAULT RATES FOR DIFFERENT

RATING CATEGORIES, RESULTS OF PERIODIC CREDIT REVIEWS AND THE GENERAL STATE OF THE ECONOMY AND AIRLINE INDUSTRY.

WE REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE GENERAL ALLOWANCE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REMAINING POOL OF RECEIVABLES (AFTER EXCLUDING THE RECEIVABLES SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIC ALLOWANCE) BY ASSESSING BOTH THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE

AND THE APPLICABLE CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATE. COLLATERAL EXPOSURE FOR A PARTICULAR RECEIVABLE IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL. A RECEIVABLE WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN EXCESS OF

THE CARRYING VALUE IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE NO COLLATERAL EXPOSURE.

PRIOR

TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, THE COLLATERAL VALUE WAS DETERMINED BY AVERAGING COLLATERAL VALUES OBTAINED FROM THIRD-PARTY EQUIPMENT APPRAISERS INDUSTRY DATA. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, WE BEGAN DETERMINING THE COLLATERAL VALUE BY

CALCULATING THE MEDIAN OF THOSE APPRAISED VALUES. THE MEDIAN VALUE METHOD PROVIDES A BETTER WEIGHTED MEASURE OF AIRCRAFT COLLATERAL VALUES. THE APPLICABLE CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATE IS DETERMINED USING TWO COMPONENTS: CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS AND

WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACT TERM. INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR EACH CUSTOMER IN THE PORTFOLIO. THOSE

74

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RATINGS ARE UPDATED BASED ON PUBLIC INFORMATION AND INFORMATION OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM OUR CUSTOMERS. PRIOR TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, WE BASED THE CUMULATIVE

DEFAULT RATE ON THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING LIFE OF THE ENTIRE PORTFOLIO. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, WE BEGAN DETERMINING THE CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATE FOR EACH RECEIVABLE BASED ON ITS WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING LIFE. BY MEASURING EACH

RECEIVABLES WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING LIFE AS OPPOSED TO USING A PORTFOLIO AVERAGE, WE HAVE INCREASED THE OVERALL ACCURACY OF THIS MEASUREMENT.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT WOULD ENTITLE US TO LOOK BEYOND THE SPECIFIC COLLATERAL UNDERLYING THE RECEIVABLE FOR PURPOSES OF

DETERMINING THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. SHOULD THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL ASSET RESULTING FROM A DEFAULT CONDITION BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR RECEIVABLE (CREATING A SHORTFALL

CONDITION), THESE AGREEMENTS, WOULD FOR EXAMPLE PERMIT US TO TAKE THE ACTIONS NECESSARY TO SELL OR RETAIN CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS IN WHICH THE CUSTOMER HAS AN EQUITY INTEREST AND USE THE PROCEEDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL.

POSTEMPLOYMENT PLANS

WE ACCOUNT FOR POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, SUCH AS SEVERANCE OR JOB TRAINING, UNDER SFAS NO.112,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS

. A LIABILITY FOR POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IS RECORDED WHEN PAYMENT IS PROBABLE, THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, AND THE OBLIGATION RELATES TO RIGHTS THAT HAVE VESTED OR ACCUMULATED.

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

SFAS NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

, BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JANUARY 1, 2003. UNDER SFAS NO. 143, OBLIGATIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF LONG-LIVED ASSETS ARE RECORDED WHEN THERE IS A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO INCUR SUCH COSTS. UPON INITIAL RECOGNITION OF A LIABILITY, THE COST IS CAPITALIZED AS PART OF THE RELATED LONG-LIVED ASSET AND DEPRECIATED OVER THE

CORRESPONDING ASSETS USEFUL LIFE. SFAS NO. 143 DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS UPON ADOPTION. THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) IS NOW CONSIDERING AN EXPOSURE DRAFT CLARIFYING

THAT A LEGAL OBLIGATION TO PERFORM AN ASSET RETIREMENT ACTIVITY THAT IS CONDITIONAL ON A FUTURE EVENT IS WITHIN THE SCOPE OF SFAS NO. 143 AND WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IF THE LIABILITYS FAIR VALUE CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING

THE TIMING AND METHOD OF SETTLEMENT THAT MAY BE CONDITIONAL ON EVENTS OCCURRING IN THE FUTURE WOULD BE FACTORED INTO THE MEASUREMENT OF THE LIABILITY RATHER THAN THE RECOGNITION OF THE LIABILITY.

ANY KNOWN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATION FOR WHICH THE LIABILITYS FAIR VALUE CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED HAS BEEN RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE HAVE CERTAIN KNOWN CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, SUCH AS ASBESTOS REMEDIATION ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN THE FUTURE, THAT ARE NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE

DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE TIMING AND METHOD OF SETTLEMENT OF THE OBLIGATION. THESE OBLIGATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PER SFAS NO. 143. A LIABILITY FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS WILL BE RECORDED IN

THE PERIOD WHEN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION REGARDING TIMING AND METHOD OF SETTLEMENT BECOMES AVAILABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LIABILITYS FAIR VALUE. IN ADDITION, THERE MAY BE CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE NOT

YET DISCOVERED (E.G. ASBESTOS MAY EXIST IN CERTAIN BUILDINGS BUT WE HAVE NOT BECOME AWARE OF IT THROUGH THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS), AND THEREFORE, THESE OBLIGATIONS ALSO HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOTE 2  STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

IN NOVEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 151,

INVENTORY COSTS  AN AMENDMENT

OF ARB NO. 43

. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES ABNORMAL AMOUNTS OF IDLE FACILITY EXPENSE, FREIGHT, HANDLING COSTS, AND WASTED

75

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MATERIAL (SPOILAGE) TO BE RECOGNIZED AS CURRENT PERIOD CHARGES. ADDITIONALLY, IT REQUIRES THAT ALLOCATION OF FIXED PRODUCTION OVERHEAD COSTS BE ALLOCATED TO INVENTORY

BASED ON THE NORMAL CAPACITY OF THE PRODUCTION FACILITY. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS STANDARD APPLY PROSPECTIVELY AND ARE EFFECTIVE FOR US FOR INVENTORY COSTS INCURRED AFTER JANUARY 1, 2006. WHILE WE BELIEVE THIS STANDARD WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT

ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING THESE NEW RULES IS DEPENDENT ON EVENTS THAT COULD OCCUR IN FUTURE PERIODS, AND AS SUCH, AN ESTIMATE OF THE IMPACT CANNOT BE DETERMINED UNTIL THE EVENT OCCURS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

IN DECEMBER 2004, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 123 (REVISED 2004) (SFAS NO. 123R),

SHARED-BASED PAYMENT

. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES COMPANIES TO MEASURE SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS AT GRANT-DATE FAIR VALUE AND RECOGNIZE THE COMPENSATION EXPENSE IN THEIR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WHILE WE PREVIOUSLY ADOPTED THE FAIR VALUE BASED METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

, SFAS NO. 123R CHANGES OUR METHOD OF MEASURING COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR OUR PERFORMANCE SHARES FROM MARKET PRICE TO FAIR VALUE AT GRANT DATE AND REQUIRES A

FORFEITURE ASSUMPTION FOR OUR UNVESTED AWARDS. ADDITIONALLY, SFAS NO. 123R AMENDS THE PRESENTATION OF THE STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS AND REQUIRES ADDITIONAL ANNUAL DISCLOSURES. WE WILL EARLY ADOPT THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123R AS OF JANUARY 1, 2005

USING THE MODIFIED PROSPECTIVE METHOD. WE BELIEVE THE IMPACT OF APPLYING AN ESTIMATED FORFEITURE ASSUMPTION TO OUR UVESTED AWARDS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOTE 3  717 PROGRAM COMPLETION

ON JANUARY 12, 2005 WE DECIDED TO CONCLUDE PRODUCTION OF THE 717 COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE

IN 2006 DUE TO THE LACK OF OVERALL MARKET DEMAND FOR THE AIRPLANE. THE DECISION IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN TOTAL PRE-TAX CHARGES OF APPROXIMATELY $385, OF WHICH $280 IS INCORPORATED IN THE 2004 FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END RESULTS.

OF THE $280 CHARGE THAT WAS INCORPORATED IN THE 2004 FOURTH QUARTER AND YEAR END

RESULTS, SUPPLIER TERMINATION CHARGES WERE $171; PRODUCTION DISRUPTION AND RELATED CHARGES WERE $36; PENSION/POST-RETIREMENT CURTAILMENT CHARGES WERE $43; AND SEVERANCE CHARGES WERE $30. OF THE $105 CHARGE THAT IS EXPECTED TO BE RECORDED IN PERIODS

SUBSEQUENT TO 2004, PENSION SETTLEMENT CHARGES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $60 AND PLANT SHUTDOWN CHARGES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE $45. THE TERMINATION OF THE 717 LINE WILL RESULT IN $385 OF CASH EXPENDITURES THAT ARE EXPECTED TO OCCUR DURING 2005 THROUGH 2007.

THIS CHARGE IS DETERMINED BASED ON CURRENT FACTS AND INFORMATION AND WE WILL REVISE OUR ESTIMATES ACCORDINGLY AS NEW FACTS AND INFORMATION BECOME AVAILABLE.

NOTE 4  GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004, A DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY WITHIN IDS IN OUR OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WAS NO LONGER NEEDED AND WE WERE UNABLE TO USE THIS

TECHNOLOGY WITHIN ANY OTHER PROGRAM; THEREFORE, WE RECOGNIZED AN IMPAIRMENT LOSS OF $4 FOR OTHER ACQUIRED INTAGIBLE ASSETS.

ON MAY 4, 2004, WE ACQUIRED A DEVELOPER OF UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLES INTO OUR A&WS SEGMENT WHICH IS REPORTED WITHIN IDS. THIS RESULTED IN $11 OF GOODWILL. DURING

THE THIRD AND FOURTH QUARTER OF 2004 WE HAD A PURCHASE ADJUSTMENT OF $24 AND $1 RELATED TO CONTRACTUAL REACH FORWARD LOSSES.

ON MARCH 3, 2004, WE ANNOUNCED THAT EFFECTIVE APRIL 1, 2004, AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT (ATM) WAS ABSORBED INTO PHANTOM WORKS ADVANCED RESEARCHED AND DEVELOPMENT

DIVISION WHICH IS INCLUDED WITHIN BOEING TECHNOLOGY AND IS REPORTED IN OUR OTHER SEGMENT. ON APRIL 1, 2004, WE PERFORMED ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TESTING ON OUR GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHICH RESULTED IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF

THE $3 OF GOODWILL PREVIOUSLY ASSIGNED TO ATM.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE REORGANIZED OUR MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS AND SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENTS INTO IDS. THIS

REORGANIZATION TRIGGERED A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003. OUR ANALYSIS TOOK INTO CONSIDERATION THE LOWER STOCK PRICE AS OF APRIL 1, 2003, TO INCLUDE THE IMPACT OF THE REQUIRED ANNUAL IMPAIRMENT TEST. AS A RESULT OF THIS

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS, WE RECORDED A GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED MARCH 31, 2003 OF $913 ($818 NET OF TAX). THIS CHARGE RELATED TO OUR SEGMENTS AS FOLLOWS: L&OS $572 AND COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES $341.

THIS IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO L&OS RESULTED DURING AN INTERNAL REORGANIZATION,

WHEN THE SFAS NO. 142 REPORTABLE SEGMENTS, OPERATING SEGMENTS, AND REPORTING UNIT DESIGNATIONS CHANGED, CAUSING SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN REPORTING UNIT CARRYING VALUES AND FAIR VALUES. SPECIFICALLY, THE NEW L&OS REPORTING

UNIT WAS CREATED BY COMBINING SIX PRE-EXISTING REPORTING UNITS: BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS, HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT & EXPLORATION, EXPENDABLE LAUNCH SYSTEMS, USA JOINT VENTURE, ROCKETDYNE PROPULSION & POWER, AND SEA LAUNCH JOINT VENTURE. THE

CARRYING VALUE OF ONE OF THESE REPORTING UNITS, BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS, EXCEEDED ITS FAIR VALUE RESULTING IN THE GOODWILL BALANCES AT THIS REPORTING UNIT BEING FULLY IMPAIRED DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2002. HOWEVER, THE CARRYING VALUES OF THE OTHER

FIVE REPORTING UNITS WERE LESS THAN THEIR FAIR VALUES, SO THE GOODWILL BALANCES AT THESE REPORTING UNITS WERE NOT IMPAIRED DURING CALENDAR YEAR 2002. IN ADDITION, THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED IN EARLY 2003 OUR LONG RANGE BUSINESS PLAN WHICH

INCLUDED DOWNWARD REVISIONS TO CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS FOR THE L&OS REPORTING UNIT. THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS RESULTED IN THE NEWLY CREATED L&OS REPORTING UNIT HAVING A CARRYING VALUE THAT EXCEEDED ITS FAIR VALUE, PROMPTING RECOGNITION

OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $572.

THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED

TO OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT WAS DUE TO THE REDUCTIONS IN THE CASH FLOW PROSPECTS AND COMPUTED FAIR VALUES OF CERTAIN REPORTING UNITS WITHIN COMMERCIAL AVIATION SERVICES.

AS A RESULT OF ADOPTING SFAS NO. 142 ON JANUARY 1, 2002, WE RECORDED A TRANSITIONAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE DURING THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2002 OF $2,410 ($1,827 NET OF TAX), PRESENTED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE. THIS CHARGE RELATED TO OUR SEGMENTS AS FOLLOWS: L&OS $1,586; COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES $430; AND OTHER $394. THE OTHER SEGMENT CHARGE RELATED TO

CONNEXION BY BOEING

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEFERRED U.S. INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES ARE NOT PROVIDED ON THE UNDISTRIBUTED CUMULATIVE EARNINGS

OF FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN THOSE OPERATIONS. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL TAXES THAT MAY BE PAYABLE UPON DISTRIBUTION.

WITHIN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS IS OTHER INCOME/EXPENSE WHICH CONSISTS

PRIMARILY OF INTEREST INCOME RECEIVED FROM TAX REFUNDS.

LEGISLATIVE UPDATE

ON OCTOBER 22, 2004, THE PRESIDENT SIGNED THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004 (THE ACT). THE ACT PROVIDES A DEDUCTION FOR INCOME

FROM QUALIFIED DOMESTIC PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES, WHICH WILL BE PHASED IN

81

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FROM 2005 THROUGH 2010. IN RETURN, THE ACT ALSO PROVIDES FOR A TWO-YEAR PHASE-OUT (EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN PRE-EXISTING BINDING CONTRACTS) OF THE EXISTING ETI EXCLUSION TAX

BENEFIT FOR FOREIGN SALES WHICH THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) RULED WAS AN ILLEGAL EXPORT SUBSIDY. THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) BELIEVES THAT THE ACT FAILS TO ADEQUATELY REPEAL THE ILLEGAL EXPORT SUBSIDIES BECAUSE OF THE TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS AND

HAS ASKED THE WTO TO REVIEW WHETHER THESE TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS ARE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THEIR PRIOR RULING. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHAT IMPACT THIS ISSUE WILL HAVE ON FUTURE EARNINGS PENDING THE FINAL RESOLUTION OF THIS MATTER. ADDITIONALLY,

THE ACT CREATES A TEMPORARY INCENTIVE FOR U.S. CORPORATIONS TO REPATRIATE ACCUMULATED INCOME EARNED ABROAD BY PROVIDING AN 85% DIVIDEND RECEIVED DEDUCTION FOR CERTAIN DIVIDENDS FROM CONTROLLED FOREIGN CORPORATIONS.

ON DECEMBER 21, 2004, FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) NO. FAS 109-1,

APPLICATION OF FASB

STATEMENT NO. 109, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES, TO THE TAX DEDUCTION ON QUALIFIED PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES PROVIDED BY THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004,

WAS ISSUED. FSP NO. FAS 109-1 CLARIFIES THAT THIS TAX DEDUCTION SHOULD BE ACCOUNTED FOR

AS A SPECIAL DEDUCTION IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

. AS SUCH, THE SPECIAL DEDUCTION HAS NO EFFECT ON DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES EXISTING AT THE DATE OF ENACTMENT. RATHER, THE IMPACT OF THIS DEDUCTION

WILL BE REPORTED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DEDUCTION IS CLAIMED ON OUR TAX RETURN BEGINNING IN 2005. AS REGULATIONS ARE STILL PENDING, WE HAVE BEEN UNABLE TO QUANTIFY THIS IMPACT.

ON DECEMBER 21, 2004, FSP NO. FAS 109-2,

ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE GUIDANCE FOR THE FOREIGN EARNINGS REPATRIATION PROVISION WITHIN

THE AMERICAN JOBS CREATION ACT OF 2004,

WAS ISSUED. FSP NO. FAS 109-2 PROVIDES COMPANIES ADDITIONAL TIME, BEYOND THE FINANCIAL REPORTING PERIOD DURING WHICH THE ACT TOOK EFFECT, TO EVALUATE THE ACTS IMPACT ON A COMPANYS PLAN FOR

REINVESTMENT OR REPATRIATION OF CERTAIN FOREIGN EARNINGS FOR PURPOSES OF APPLYING SFAS NO. 109. FSP NO. FAS 109-2 WAS EFFECTIVE UPON ISSUANCE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, MANAGEMENT HAD NOT DECIDED ON WHETHER, AND TO WHAT EXTENT WE MIGHT REPATRIATE

FOREIGN EARNINGS UNDER THE ACT, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DO NOT REFLECT ANY PROVISIONS FOR TAXES ON UNREMITTED FOREIGN EARNINGS. BASED ON OUR ANALYSIS OF THE ACT, ALTHOUGH NOT YET FINALIZED, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT UNDER THE

REPATRIATION PROVISION OF THE ACT WE MAY REPATRIATE SOME AMOUNT OF EARNINGS BETWEEN $0 TO $350 WITH THE RESPECTIVE TAX LIABILITY RANGING FROM $0 TO $26. WE EXPECT TO BE IN A POSITION TO FINALIZE OUR ASSESSMENT BY JUNE 30, 2005.

INVENTORY BALANCES INCLUDED $233 SUBJECT TO CLAIMS OR OTHER UNCERTAINTIES PRIMARILY RELATING TO THE A-12 PROGRAM AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003.

INCLUDED IN COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAM INVENTORY AND DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE SALES CONTRACTS FOR THE PRODUCTION OF AIRCRAFT ARE AMOUNTS PAID OR CREDITED IN CASH OR

OTHER CONSIDERATION, TO AIRLINE CUSTOMERS TOTALING $665 AND $543 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003. THESE AMOUNTS ARE REFERRED TO AS EARLY ISSUE SALES CONSIDERATION. EARLY ISSUE SALES CONSIDERATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE WHEN THE

DELIVERY OF THE AIRCRAFT UNDER CONTRACT OCCURS. IN THE UNLIKELY SITUATION THAT AN AIRLINE CUSTOMER WAS NOT ABLE TO PERFORM AND TAKE DELIVERY OF THE CONTRACTED AIRCRAFT WE BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS PAID THROUGH

RETAINING AMOUNTS SECURED BY ADVANCES RECEIVED ON AIRCRAFT TO

BE DELIVERED. HOWEVER TO THE EXTENT EARLY ISSUE SALES CONSIDERATION EXCEEDS ADVANCES THESE AMOUNTS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE AND WOULD BE RECOGNIZED AS A CURRENT PERIOD

DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER

WHEN WE ARE UNABLE TO IMMEDIATELY SELL USED AIRCRAFT HELD BY COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES, WE MAY PLACE THE AIRCRAFT ON OPERATING LEASES, OR FINANCE THE SALE OF NEW

AIRCRAFT WITH A SHORT-TERM NOTE RECEIVABLE. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF AIRCRAFT ON OPERATING LEASE, OR SALES FINANCED UNDER A NOTE RECEIVABLE, TOTALED $958 AND $447 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 AND RESULTED IN A DECREASE TO INVENTORY AND AN

OFFSETTING INCREASE TO CUSTOMER FINANCING. THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED AS NON-CASH TRANSACTIONS AND EXCLUDED FROM THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. HOWEVER WE CHANGED THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE CASH FLOW EFFECTS OF CUSTOMER

FINANCING TRANSACTIONS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY PRESENTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES. AS SUCH THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE NOW RECORDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. (SEE NOTE 26.)

DURING 2002 WE WERE SELECTED BY THE US AIR FORCE (USAF) TO SUPPLY 100 767 TANKERS AND ENTERED INTO A PRELIMINARY AGREEMENT WITH THE

USAF FOR THE PROCUREMENT OF THE 100 TANKERS. ON JANUARY 14, 2005 WE ANNOUNCED OUR PLAN TO RECOGNIZE PRE-TAX CHARGES TOTALING $275 RELATED TO THE USAF 767 TANKER PROGRAM. THE CHARGE, WHICH IS A RESULT OF OUR QUARTER AND YEAR-END REVIEWS, REFLECTS OUR

NOTE 9  DISCONTINUED

OPERATIONS  COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES

ON MAY 2, 2004, OUR

BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A PLAN TO SELL ALL OF THE ASSETS AND BUSINESS OPERATIONS OF BCCS COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS. THIS PLAN WAS APPROVED BY BCCS BOARD OF DIRECTORS ON MAY 21, 2004. ON MAY 24, 2004, BCC ENTERED INTO A

PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WITH GENERAL ELECTRIC CAPITAL CORPORATION (GECC) TO SELL SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE ASSETS RELATED TO ITS COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS. THE PURCHASE AGREEMENT, AS AMENDED, CALLED FOR THE SALE OF THE ASSETS TO TAKE

PLACE IN A SERIES OF CLOSINGS, COMMENCING ON MAY 31, 2004 AND ENDING NO LATER THAN

84

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE FINAL ASSET SALE CLOSED ON DECEMBER 27, 2004. BCC INTENDS TO DISPOSE OF THE REMAINING ASSETS IDENTIFIED TO THE COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES

BUSINESS THAT ARE NOT SUBJECT TO THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WITH GECC BY THE END OF THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2005.

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED FOOTNOTE DISCLOSURES REFLECT THE COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS AS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL

SERVICES BUSINESS, NET OF APPLICABLE INCOME TAXES, IS SHOWN AS INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 144. IN ADDITION, THE ASSETS OF THIS BUSINESS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED AND PRESENTED AS ASSETS OF

DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS. THERE ARE NO LIABILITIES RELATED TO THE COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE ASSUMED BY GECC OR OTHER BUYERS, OTHER THAN THOSE SPECIFIC LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PORTFOLIO ASSETS SOLD, SUCH AS

SECURITY DEPOSITS AND MAINTENANCE RESERVES.

THE ASSETS SOLD TO GECC

CONSISTED OF LEASES AND FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS HAVING A CARRYING VALUE OF $1,872 AS OF MAY 31, 2004. THE PURCHASE PRICE PAID FOR THE ASSETS TRANSFERRED AT EACH CLOSING WAS DETERMINED BASED ON THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE ASSETS, PLUS A TOTAL PREMIUM OF

$140 THAT WAS PAID AS OF JUNE 30, 2004. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, BCC HAD RECEIVED $2,017 IN CASH PROCEEDS FROM THIS SALE.

AS PART OF THE PURCHASE AND SALE AGREEMENT WITH GECC, BCC AGREED TO A SHARING ARRANGEMENT FOR LOSSES THAT MAY BE INCURRED AT THE END OF THE INITIAL FINANCING TERMS

OF THE TRANSFERRED PORTFOLIO ASSETS, OR, IN SOME INSTANCES, PRIOR TO THE END OF THE FINANCING TERM, SUCH AS CERTAIN EVENTS OF DEFAULT AND REPOSSESSION. THE LOSS SHARING ARRANGEMENT PROVIDES THAT CUMULATIVE NET LOSSES (IF ANY) ARE TO BE SHARED

BETWEEN BCC AND GECC IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE FOLLOWING FORMULA: (I) WITH RESPECT TO THE FIRST $150 OF CUMULATIVE NET LOSSES, BCC WILL BE LIABLE TO GECC FOR 80% OF THE AMOUNT THEREOF (IN SUCH EVENT GECC WILL BEAR 20% OF SUCH LOSSES); (II) WITH RESPECT

TO CUMULATIVE NET LOSSES BETWEEN $150 AND $275, BCC WILL BE LIABLE TO GECC FOR 100% OF SUCH ADDITIONAL CUMULATIVE NET LOSSES; AND (III) IF CUMULATIVE LOSSES EXCEED $275, GECC WILL BEAR 100% OF THE LOSS RISK ABOVE $275. THESE PROVISIONS EFFECTIVELY

CAP BCCS EXPOSURE TO ANY LOSSES AS REFERRED TO HEREIN AT $245. IN THE EVENT THERE ARE CUMULATIVE NET GAINS ON THE PORTFOLIO, GECC IS REQUIRED TO MAKE AN EARN-OUT PAYMENT TO BCC IN AN AMOUNT EQUAL TO 80% OF SUCH CUMULATIVE NET GAIN.

GAINS AND LOSSES ON THE PORTFOLIO ARE TO BE MEASURED ON A CUMULATIVE BASIS OVER THE REMAINING LIFE OF THE PORTFOLIO ASSETS. THE AMOUNT OF THE GAIN OR LOSS ON ANY PARTICULAR PORTFOLIO ASSET IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE

EQUIPMENT ASSET SECURING THE PORTFOLIO ASSET AND THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE PORTFOLIO ASSET. BCC HAS THE RIGHT IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES TO PARTICIPATE IN A REFINANCING OR OTHER REDEPLOYMENT OF A PORTFOLIO ASSET FOR THE PURPOSE OF MINIMIZING ANY LOSS

ON SUCH ASSET.

IN 2004, BCC RECORDED A GAIN OF $72 ($46 NET OF TAX) DUE

TO THE SALE OF THE COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSETS TO GECC. THE GAIN WAS CALCULATED AS THE $140 PREMIUM LESS THE INCREASE IN BCCS RESERVE FOR FUTURE PORTFOLIO LOSSES, ESTIMATED SALES AND EXCISE TAXES, AND INVESTMENT BANKING, TRANSACTION

AND LEGAL FEES. BASED UPON AN ANALYSIS THAT CONSIDERED COLLATERAL VALUES AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE COUNTERPARTIES, BCC HAD ESTABLISHED A LIABILITY OF $90 AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, TO RESERVE FOR PROBABLE FUTURE PORTFOLIO LOSSES, WHICH INCLUDED $54

PREVIOUSLY REPORTED AS AN ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES TRANSFERRED TO GECC. BCC DETERMINED ITS EXPECTED LOSSES OF $90 BASED ON THE CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS, PUBLISHED HISTORICAL DEFAULT RATES FOR VARIOUS RATING CATEGORIES AND THE COLLATERAL

EXPOSURE FOR EACH CUSTOMER BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BOOK CARRYING VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE ASSETS. FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS MAY BE MADE AS CIRCUMSTANCES DICTATE AND WILL BE RECORDED AS PART OF BCCS CONTINUING

OPERATIONS.

SINCE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THE OPERATING ACTIVITIES OF

BCCS FORMER COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES BUSINESS WERE INCLUDED IN THE SALE OF THE COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES PORTFOLIO ASSETS AND OPERATIONS TO GECC, BCC ELECTED NOT TO ALLOCATE ANY INTEREST EXPENSE OR GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE

TO ITS DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS FOLLOWING MAY 2004, THE MONTH IN WHICH THE SALE TO GECC WAS

85

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ANNOUNCED. FOR THE FIVE MONTHS ENDED MAY 31, 2004, BCC ALLOCATED $31 OF INTEREST EXPENSE AND $3 OF GENERAL ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE TO THE COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES

BUSINESS WHICH IS REFLECTED IN INCOME FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

DURING 2004, THE NET GAIN ON THE DISPOSAL OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS OF $66 ($42 NET OF TAX), WHICH INCLUDED A GAIN OF $72 ($46 NET OF TAX) RELATED TO THE SALE OF ASSETS TO GECC AND A LOSS OF $6 ($4 NET OF TAX) RELATED TO THE REVALUATION OF

THE REMAINING COMMERCIAL FINANCIAL SERVICES ASSETS TO THE LOWER OF CARRYING VALUE OR FAIR VALUE LESS COSTS TO SELL. THIS REVALUATION LOSS RELATED PRINCIPALLY TO ONE 737 BOEING BUSINESS JET (BBJ).

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, WE REASSESSED OUR NEAR TERM FLEET REQUIREMENTS AND

THAT RESULTED IN ONE BBJ BEING RETAINED IN OUR EXECUTIVE FLEET. AS A RESULT OF THIS DECISION, BCC RECORDED ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE OF $11 AS PART OF OUR CONTINUING OPERATIONS AND RECLASSIFIED THE ASSET FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

AIRCRAFT FINANCING IS COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITY IN THE RELATED ASSET; WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS IN

ACCESSING SUCH COLLATERAL. HOWEVER, THE VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL IS CLOSELY TIED TO COMMERCIAL AIRLINE PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE SUBJECT TO REDUCED VALUATION WITH MARKET DECLINE. OUR FINANCING PORTFOLIO HAS A CONCENTRATION OF 757, 717 AND MD-11 MODEL

AIRCRAFT THAT HAVE VALUATION EXPOSURE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, NOTES RECEIVABLE, SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES AND OPERATING LEASES ATTRIBUTABLE TO AIRCRAFT FINANCING INCLUDED $1,457 AND $1,378 ATTRIBUTABLE TO 757 MODEL AIRCRAFT ($475 AND

$511 ACCOUNTED FOR AS OPERATING LEASES) AND $2,308 AND $2,109 ATTRIBUTABLE TO 717 MODEL AIRCRAFT ($596 AND $467 ACCOUNTED FOR AS OPERATING LEASES) AND $833 AND $895 ATTRIBUTABLE TO MD-11 MODEL AIRCRAFT ($687 AND $732 ACCOUNTED FOR AS OPERATING

CERTAIN CUSTOMERS HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION OR

REQUESTED LEASE OR LOAN RESTRUCTURINGS; THESE NEGOTIATIONS WERE IN VARIOUS STAGES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004.

·

DURING 2003, BCC COMPLETED A RESTRUCTURING OF UNITED AIRLINES, INC. (UNITED) AIRCRAFT LOANS AND LEASES. UNITED ACCOUNTED FOR $1,131 AND $1,159 (10% AND 11%) OF OUR

AIRCRAFT FINANCING PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003. THE TERMS OF THE RESTRUCTURED LOANS AND LEASES RESULTED IN A CHARGE TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE OF $50.

·

DURING 2003, BCC AGREED TO RESTRUCTURE CERTAIN OUTSTANDING LEASES WITH ATA HOLDINGS CORP. (ATA). ATA ACCOUNTED FOR $705 AND $707 (6% AND 6%) OF OUR AIRCRAFT FINANCING

PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003. THE TERMS OF THE RESTRUCTURED LEASES DID NOT RESULT IN A CHARGE TO THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE.

·

DURING 2004, BCC COMPLETED A RESTRUCTURING OF ITS LEASES WITH HAWAIIAN AIRLINES, INC. (HAWAIIAN). AS A RESULT OF THE APPROVAL OF THE RESTRUCTURED LEASE TERMS, BCC RECORDED

A PROVISION FOR LOSSES OF $13 DUE TO THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE APPROVED BANKRUPTCY CLAIM AND THE AMOUNT IT RECEIVED WHEN IT SOLD THE CLAIM. HAWAIIAN ACCOUNTED FOR $456 AND $506 (4% AND 5%) OF OUR AIRCRAFT FINANCING PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2004

AND 2003.

IN ADDITION TO THE CUSTOMERS DISCUSSED

ABOVE, SOME OTHER CUSTOMERS HAVE REQUESTED A RESTRUCTURING OF THEIR TRANSACTIONS. BCC HAS NOT REACHED AGREEMENT ON ANY OTHER RESTRUCTURING REQUESTS THAT WE BELIEVE WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL

POSITION.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE RECORDED $18 ($17 RECOGNIZED AT BCC) TO INCREASE THE VALUATION

ALLOWANCE DUE TO THE NORMAL PROVISION FOR LOSSES IN THE CUSTOMER FINANCING PORTFOLIO. ADDITIONALLY, DURING THE YEAR ENDED 2004, WE INCREASED THE PROVISION FOR LOSSES BY $27 ($82 RECOGNIZED AT THE OTHER SEGMENT OFFSET BY A REDUCTION OF $55 RECOGNIZED

AT BCC). THE INCREASE WAS DUE TO DETERIORATED AIRLINE CREDIT RATINGS AND DEPRESSED AIRCRAFT VALUES BASED ON OUR QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT OF THE ADEQUACY OF CUSTOMER FINANCING RESERVES AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT IMPACTED THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2004. THE PRIMARY FACTORS ATTRIBUTING TO THE $27 INCREASE IN THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE IN 2004 WERE: AN INCREASE OF $87 IN THE REQUIREMENT IN THE ALLOWANCE ACCOUNT RESULTING FROM THE DETERMINATION THAT RECEIVABLES FROM ATA WERE SUBJECT TO

A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT OFFSET BY $53 OF BENEFIT FROM THE MITIGATION OF COLLATERAL EXPOSURE FROM AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, WE RECORDED $23 ($21 RECOGNIZED AT BCC) TO INCREASE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE

DUE TO NORMAL PROVISION FOR LOSSES IN THE CUSTOMER FINANCING PORTFOLIO AND RECORDED A CHARGE OF $191 ($130 RECOGNIZED AT BCC) TO INCREASE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE DUE TO DETERIORATED AIRLINE CREDIT RATINGS AND DEPRESSED AIRCRAFT VALUES BASED ON OUR

QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT OF THE ADEQUACY OF CUSTOMER FINANCING RESERVES. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, WE RECORDED $10 ($8 RECOGNIZED AT BCC) TO INCREASE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE DUE TO NORMAL PROVISION FOR LOSSES IN THE CUSTOMER FINANCING

PORTFOLIO AND RECORDED A CHARGE OF $180 ($100 RECOGNIZED AT BCC) TO INCREASE THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE DUE TO DETERIORATED AIRLINE CREDIT RATINGS AND DEPRESSED AIRCRAFT VALUES BASED ON OUR QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT OF THE ADEQUACY OF CUSTOMER FINANCING

RESERVES.

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE INCLUDES AMOUNTS RECORDED EITHER AS

SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCES ON RECEIVABLES OR GENERAL VALUATION ALLOWANCES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, CARRYING AMOUNTS OF IMPAIRED RECEIVABLES WERE $2,232 AND $1,605.

SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCES FOR LOSSES OF $295 AND $123 WERE ALLOCATED TO $1,179 AND $483 OF IMPAIRED RECEIVABLES AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2004 AND 2003. REMAINING ALLOWANCE BALANCES OF $108 AND $281 WERE RECORDED AS GENERAL VALUATION ALLOWANCES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003.

THE AVERAGE RECORDED INVESTMENT IN IMPAIRED RECEIVABLES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, WAS $1,940, $1,688 AND $211. INCOME RECOGNITION IS GENERALLY

SUSPENDED FOR RECEIVABLES AT THE DATE WHEN FULL RECOVERY OF INCOME AND PRINCIPAL BECOMES DOUBTFUL. INCOME RECOGNITION IS RESUMED WHEN RECEIVABLES BECOME CONTRACTUALLY CURRENT AND PERFORMANCE IS DEMONSTRATED BY THE CUSTOMER. THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST

INCOME RECOGNIZED ON SUCH RECEIVABLES DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH THEY WERE CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WAS $30, $106 AND $18 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, OF WHICH $35, $115 AND $12 WAS RECOGNIZED ON A CASH BASIS, RESPECTIVELY.

DURING 2004, WE RECORDED CHARGES RELATED TO CUSTOMER FINANCING

ACTIVITIES OF $42 IN OPERATING EARNINGS, WHICH INCLUDED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $29 ($27 RECORDED BY BCC) AND A CHARGE OF $13 RECORDED IN THE OTHER SEGMENT RELATING TO THE REDUCTION OF ANTICIPATED LEASE RATES ON SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT. DURING 2003, WE

RECORDED CHARGES RELATED TO CUSTOMER FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF $126 IN OPERATING EARNINGS, WHICH INCLUDES IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $105 ($100 RECORDED BY BCC) AND $21 OF CHARGES RELATED TO THE WRITE-OFF OF FORWARD-STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED TO

HAWAIIAN. DURING 2002, WE RECORDED CHARGES OF $110 RELATED TO CUSTOMER FINANCING ACTIVITIES, OF WHICH $66 RELATED TO THE RETURN OF 24 717S BY AMR CORPORATION. THE IMPAIRMENTS RESULTED FROM THE DETERIORATED AIRCRAFT VALUES AND REDUCED ESTIMATED CASH

FLOWS FOR OPERATING LEASES.

JOINT VENTURES AND OTHER INVESTMENTS

ALL INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND INVESTMENTS. AT DECEMBER

31, 2004 AND 2003, INVESTMENTS INCLUDED $67 AND $98 ATTRIBUTABLE TO INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES. INVESTMENTS ALSO INCLUDED OTHER NON-MARKETABLE SECURITIES OF $73 AND $63 AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003.

THE PRINCIPAL JOINT VENTURE ARRANGEMENTS ARE UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE; HRL LABORATORIES,

LLC; APB WINGLETS COMPANY, LLC; BATA LEASING, LLC (BATA); AND SEA LAUNCH. WE HAVE A 50% PARTNERSHIP WITH LOCKHEED MARTIN IN UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL GROUND PROCESSING OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE FLEET AND FOR SPACE-RELATED

OPERATIONS WITH THE USAF. UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE ALSO PERFORMS MODIFICATIONS, TESTING AND CHECKOUT OPERATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO READY THE SPACE SHUTTLE FOR LAUNCH. WE ARE ENTITLED TO 33% OF THE EARNINGS FROM HRL LABORATORIES, LLC, WHICH CONDUCTS

APPLIED RESEARCH IN THE ELECTRONICS AND INFORMATION SCIENCES; AND CREATES NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR SPACE, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, DEFENSE AND AUTOMOTIVE APPLICATIONS. WE HAVE A 45% OWNERSHIP OF APB WINGLETS COMPANY, LLC, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED FOR

THE PURPOSES OF DESIGNING, DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING, INSTALLING, CERTIFYING, RETROFITTING, MARKETING, SELLING, AND PROVIDING AFTER-SALES SUPPORT WITH RESPECT TO WINGLETS FOR RETROFIT AIRCRAFT.

WE HAVE A 50% PARTNERSHIP WITH ATA IN BATA, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED TO ACQUIRE AIRCRAFT

AND MARKET AND LEASE THE AIRCRAFT TO THIRD-PARTIES. DURING 2003, WE FINALIZED AN AMENDMENT TO THE PARTNERSHIP, WHICH GAVE US MAJORITY CONTROL IN THE MANAGEMENT OF THE BUSINESS AND AFFAIRS OF BATA. AS A RESULT, BATA IS NOW CONSOLIDATED IN OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE, IN WHICH WE ARE A 40% PARTNER WITH RSC ENERGIA (25%) OF RUSSIA, KVAERNER ASA (20%) OF

NORWAY, AND KB YUZHNOYE/PO YUZHMASH (15%) OF UKRAINE, PROVIDES OCEAN-BASED LAUNCH SERVICES TO COMMERCIAL SATELLITE CUSTOMERS. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE VENTURE CONDUCTED THREE LAUNCHES. THE VENTURE ALSO CONDUCTED THREE LAUNCHES IN

2003. OUR INVESTMENT IN THIS VENTURE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, REFLECTS THE RECOGNITION OF OUR SHARE OF LOSSES REPORTED BY SEA LAUNCH IN PRIOR YEARS. THE VENTURE INCURRED LOSSES IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, DUE TO THE RELATIVELY LOW VOLUME OF LAUNCHES,

DRIVEN BY A DEPRESSED COMMERCIAL SATELLITE MARKET. WE HAVE FINANCIAL EXPOSURE WITH RESPECT TO THE VENTURE, WHICH RELATES TO GUARANTEES BY US PROVIDED TO CERTAIN SEA LAUNCH CREDITORS, PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY US TO A SEA LAUNCH CUSTOMER AND

FINANCIAL EXPOSURE RELATED TO ADVANCES AND OTHER ASSETS REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE HAVE CONSISTENTLY APPLIED THE REQUIREMENTS SET FORTH IN PARAGRAPH 19(I) OF ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE BULLETIN (APB) 18,

THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR INVESTMENTS IN COMMON STOCK

, TO ACCOUNT FOR

OUR INVESTMENT IN THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE. ACCORDINGLY, WE SUSPENDED RECORDING EQUITY LOSSES AFTER WRITING OUR INVESTMENT IN AND DIRECT LOANS TO SEA LAUNCH DOWN TO ZERO AND ACCRUING OUR OBLIGATION FOR THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES ON SEA LAUNCH

INDEBTEDNESS. WE ARE NOT COMMITTED TO PROVIDE ANY FURTHER FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE. HOWEVER, IN THE EVENT THAT WE DO EXTEND ADDITIONAL FINANCIAL SUPPORT TO SEA LAUNCH IN THE FUTURE, WE WILL RECOGNIZE SUSPENDED LOSSES AS

APPROPRIATE.

DURING 2003, WE RECORDED A CHARGE OF $55 RELATED TO

RESOURCE 21, A PARTNERSHIP ENTERED INTO WITH THREE OTHER PARTIES SEVERAL YEARS AGO TO DEVELOP COMMERCIAL REMOTE SENSING AND GROUND MONITORING. THE CHARGE RESULTED FROM A DECISION BY NASA TO NOT AWARD AN IMAGERY CONTRACT TO RESOURCE 21. DURING 2003,

WE ALSO RECORDED ADJUSTMENTS TO EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN ELLIPSO, SKYBRIDGE AND TELEDESIC RESULTING IN THE NET WRITE DOWN OF $27.

DURING 2002, A $100 IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS RECORDED TO WRITE OFF A COST-METHOD INVESTMENT IN TELEDESIC, LLC, WHICH STOPPED WORK ON ITS SATELLITE CONSTELLATION AND

ANNOUNCED ITS INTENT TO REDUCE STAFF. IN ADDITION, WE RECORDED A $48 IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED TO OUR BATA LEASING, LLC, JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENT. THIS CHARGE WAS OUR SHARE OF THE ADJUSTMENT TO ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR THE JOINT

VENTURES 727 AIRCRAFT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING 2004, WE INVESTED $3,011 OF CASH IN AN EXTERNALLY MANAGED PORTFOLIO OF INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED INCOME

INSTRUMENTS. THE PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND HIGHLY LIQUID AND PRIMARILY CONSISTS OF U.S. DOLLAR DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF THE UNITED STATES TREASURY, OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, CORPORATIONS, MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED SECURITIES. THE PORTFOLIO HAS

AN AVERAGE DURATION OF 1.5 YEARS. DEBT SECURITIES WITH MATURITIES LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AND THE REMAINING SECURITIES ARE LONG TERM INVESTMENTS (EXCEPT CASH EQUIVALENTS WITH MATURITIES LESS THAN 90 DAYS). AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2004, AMOUNTS INVESTED WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $2,718 WERE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. WE DO NOT INTEND TO HOLD THESE INVESTMENTS TO MATURITY, NOR DO WE INTEND TO ACTIVELY AND

FREQUENTLY BUY AND SELL THESE SECURITIES WITH THE OBJECTIVE OF GENERATING PROFITS ON SHORT-TERM DIFFERENCES IN PRICE. IN ADDITION, AMOUNTS TOTALING $108 WERE CLASSIFIED AS CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS AND $173 WERE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND

RECORDED IN SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. DURING 2004, REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON THESE INVESTMENTS WERE NOT MATERIAL.

IN NOVEMBER 2004, WE SIGNED A TERM SHEET WHEREBY WE AGREED TO EXCHANGE A D TRANCHE INVESTMENT ISSUED BY A TRUST SPONSORED BY DELTA AIR LINES, INC. (DELTA) FOR TWO C TRANCHE INVESTMENTS OWNED BY DELTA AND

CERTAIN OTHER RIGHTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE ADJUSTED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE D TRANCHE INVESTMENT TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CONSIDERATION TO BE RECEIVED UPON COMPLETION OF THE EXCHANGE WITH DELTA OF $146, WITH THE ASSISTANCE OF INDEPENDENT

VALUATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE RECORDED A PRE-TAX NON-CASH CHARGE TO ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE OF $32 AS A RESULT OF THIS ADJUSTMENT, WE HAVE SUBSTANTIALLY MITIGATED FURTHER RISK OF A REALIZED LOSS BY IMPROVING THE COLLATERAL PACKAGE AVAILABLE TO SECURE THE

INVESTMENTS WHILE MAINTAINING AN EXPECTED RETURN EQUAL TO THE ORIGINAL D TRANCHE INVESTMENT.

AS A RESULT OF OUR DECISION TO PARTICIPATE IN AN EXCHANGE OF ASSETS WITH DELTA, WE DETERMINED THAT WE DID NOT INTEND TO HOLD OUR INVESTMENT IN THE D TRANCHE UNTIL MATURITY. AS A RESULT OF THIS DECISION, WE DETERMINED THAT OUR

ENTIRE PORTFOLIO OF HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES WOULD HAVE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES. SINCE OUR ECONOMIC COMMITMENT TO THE EXCHANGE OF ASSETS OCCURRED IN MID-DECEMBER 2004, WE ELECTED TO RECLASSIFY OUR HELD-TO-MATURITY

INVESTMENTS TOTALING $354 AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2004. WE REDUCED THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENTS BY $37 AND RECORDED AN EQUAL CHARGE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/LOSS. WE DO NOT EXPECT THAT WE

WILL BE ABLE TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY OF OUR INVESTMENTS AS HELD-TO-MATURITY INVESTMENTS FOR AT LEAST TWO YEARS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SPECIFIC ACCOUNTING LITERATURE. WE WILL RECORD THE QUARTERLY CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES

AS CHANGES TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE SECURITIES WITH A CORRESPONDING CHANGE TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/LOSS.

ON AN ONGOING BASIS, WE WILL PERFORM AN IMPAIRMENT TEST ON OUR INVESTMENT SECURITIES TO DETERMINE IF THE FAIR VALUE DECLINE OF A SECURITY IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

IF THE IMPAIRMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, WE RESET THE COST BASIS FOR THE IMPAIRED SECURITY AND RECORD THE CHARGE IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS INCLUDED $312 OF SUBORDINATED DEBT INVESTMENTS IN SEVERAL EETCS, WHICH INCLUDES OUR DEBT SECURITY IN

DELTA. EETCS ARE SECURED BY AIRCRAFT ON LEASE TO COMMERCIAL AIRLINES. EETCS PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH TRANCHED RIGHTS TO CASH FLOWS FROM A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT, AS WELL AS A COLLATERAL POSITION IN THE RELATED ASSET. WHILE THE UNDERLYING CLASSES OF

EQUIPMENT NOTES VARY BY MATURITY AND/OR COUPON DEPENDING UPON TENOR OR LEVEL OF SUBORDINATION OF THE SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT NOTES AND THEIR CORRESPONDING CLAIM ON THE AIRCRAFT, THE BASIC FUNCTION OF AN EETC REMAINS TO PASSIVELY HOLD SEPARATE DEBT

INVESTMENTS TO ENHANCE LIQUIDITY FOR INVESTORS, WHO IN TURN PASS THIS LIQUIDITY BENEFIT DIRECTLY TO THE AIRLINE IN THE FORM OF LOWER COUPON AND/OR GREATER DEBT CAPACITY. WE PARTICIPATE IN SEVERAL EETCS AS AN INVESTOR. OUR EETC INVESTMENTS ARE

RELATED TO CUSTOMERS THAT HAVE LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. APPROXIMATELY $287 OF THE ABOVE AMOUNTS RELATES TO INVESTMENTS THAT WERE ACQUIRED IN 2002. DUE TO THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION MARKET

92

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DOWNTURN, THESE SECURITIES HAVE BEEN IN A CONTINUOUS UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION FOR 12 MONTHS OR LONGER. DESPITE THE UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION OF THESE SECURITIES, WE

HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THESE EETC INVESTMENTS ARE NOT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THIS ASSESSMENT WAS BASED ON THE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL TO THE SECURITIES, THE TERM OF THE SECURITIES, AND BOTH INTERNAL AND THIRD-PARTY CREDIT REVIEWS

AND ANALYSES OF THE COUNTERPARTIES, PRINCIPALLY MAJOR DOMESTIC AIRLINES. ACCORDINGLY, WE HAVE CONCLUDED THAT IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COLLECT ALL AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THESE DEBT SECURITIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, OUR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE INVESTMENTS INCLUDED AN INVESTMENT IN

MANDATORILY REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK OF ATA THAT HAD BEEN IN A CONTINUOUS UNREALIZED LOSS POSITION SINCE 2001. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2004, OUR ASSESSMENT OF ATAS CONTINUED FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES LED US TO CONCLUDE THAT THE UNSECURED

PREFERRED STOCK INVESTMENT MATURING IN 2015 WAS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. ACCORDINGLY, WE LOWERED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THIS INVESTMENT TO ITS FAIR VALUE, RESULTING IN A PRE-TAX NON-CASH CHARGE TO ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE OF $29. OF THIS

AMOUNT, $17 OF PRE-TAX UNREALIZED LOSS ($11 NET OF TAX) WAS RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/LOSS TO ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2004, WE REASSESSED THE FAIR VALUE OF THIS INVESTMENT, RESULTING IN AN

ADDITIONAL PRE-TAX NON-CASH CHARGE TO ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE OF $18, WHICH REDUCED THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE INVESTMENT TO ZERO.

THERE WERE NO OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS RECOGNIZED IN 2003. HOWEVER, DURING 2002, WE RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT OF $79 RELATED TO ONE OF BCCS LONG-HELD

INVESTMENTS IN EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES (ETCS) SECURED BY AIRCRAFT ON LEASE TO UNITED, WHICH IS RECORDED IN COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THIS DEBT INVESTMENT WAS CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY AND HAD DECLINED IN VALUE FOR A PERIOD THAT WAS

DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ADDITIONALLY, DURING 2002, $40 ($25 NET OF TAX) OF UNREALIZED LOSS WAS RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/LOSS TO OTHER INCOME DUE TO OTHER THAN TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

INVESTMENTS.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, THERE WAS NO UNREALIZED LOSS RECORDED

IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/LOSS RELATED TO DEBT SECURITIES THAT WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE TO HELD-TO-MATURITY AT THEIR FAIR VALUES COMPARED WITH $14 AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

NOTE 14  DEFERRED LEASE INCOME

DURING 2004, WE DELIVERED ONE 767 AIRCRAFT TO A JOINT VENTURE NAMED TRM AIRCRAFT

LEASING CO. LTD (TRM). DURING 2003, WE DELIVERED FOUR 767 AIRCRAFT TO TRM. TRM WAS ESTABLISHED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2003 IN ORDER TO PROVIDE FINANCING AND ARRANGE FOR A TOTAL OF FIVE 767 AIRCRAFT TO BE LEASED TO JAPAN AIRLINES. THE LEASES ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS OPERATING LEASES EACH WITH A TERM OF SEVEN YEARS. WE HAVE PROVIDED FINANCING OF APPROXIMATELY $42 RELATED TO THE FIVE AIRCRAFT, WHICH IN COMBINATION WITH OUR PARTIAL OWNERSHIP OF TRM, HAS CAUSED US TO RETAIN SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF

OWNERSHIP IN THE AIRCRAFT. AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZE RENTAL INCOME OVER THE TERM OF THE LEASE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE REMAINING DEFERRED LEASE INCOME WAS $379 AND $318, DISCOUNTED AT A RATE OF 5.0%.

DURING 2001, WE DELIVERED FOUR C-17 TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT TO THE UNITED

KINGDOM ROYAL AIR FORCE (UKRAF), WHICH WERE ACCOUNTED FOR AS OPERATING LEASES. THE LEASE TERM IS SEVEN YEARS, AT THE END OF WHICH THE UKRAF HAS THE RIGHT TO PURCHASE THE AIRCRAFT FOR A STIPULATED VALUE, CONTINUE THE LEASE FOR TWO ADDITIONAL YEARS OR

RETURN THE AIRCRAFT. CONCURRENT WITH THE NEGOTIATION OF THIS LEASE, WE, ALONG WITH UKRAF, ARRANGED TO ASSIGN THE CONTRACTUAL LEASE PAYMENTS TO AN INDEPENDENT FINANCIAL INSTITUTION. WE RECEIVED PROCEEDS FROM THE FINANCIAL INSTITUTION IN CONSIDERATION

OF THE ASSIGNMENT OF THE FUTURE LEASE RECEIVABLES FROM THE UKRAF. THE ASSIGNMENT OF LEASE RECEIVABLES IS NON-RECOURSE TO US. THE INITIAL PROCEEDS REPRESENTED THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE ASSIGNED TOTAL LEASE RECEIVABLES DISCOUNTED AT A RATE OF 6.6%. AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE BALANCE OF $366 AND $457 REPRESENTED THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE REMAINING DEFERRED LEASE INCOME.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ON MARCH 23, 2004, WE FILED A SHELF REGISTRATION WITH THE SEC FOR $1,000 FOR THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT SECURITIES AND

UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK. THE ENTIRE AMOUNT REMAINS AVAILABLE FOR POTENTIAL DEBT ISSUANCE. BCC HAS $3,421 THAT REMAINS AVAILABLE FROM SHELF REGISTRATIONS FILED WITH THE SEC.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004, $183 OF BCC DEBT WAS COLLATERALIZED BY PORTFOLIO ASSETS AND UNDERLYING EQUIPMENT TOTALING $300. THE DEBT

CONSISTS OF THE 1.67% TO 5.79% NOTES DUE THROUGH 2015.

NOTE 16  POSTRETIREMENT

PLANS

WE HAVE VARIOUS PENSION PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

EMPLOYEES. WE FUND ALL OUR MAJOR PENSION PLANS THROUGH TRUSTS. THE KEY OBJECTIVE OF HOLDING PENSION FUNDS IN A TRUST IS TO SATISFY THE RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF THE PENSION PLANS. PENSION ASSETS ARE PLACED IN TRUST SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF

THE PENSION PLANS PARTICIPANTS, AND ARE STRUCTURED TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO PAY BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS TO KEEP PACE OVER THE LONG TERM WITH THE GROWTH OF OBLIGATIONS FOR FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

WE ALSO HAVE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS WHICH CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF

HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, LIFE INSURANCE TO CERTAIN GROUPS OF RETIREES. RETIREE HEALTH CARE IS PROVIDED PRINCIPALLY UNTIL AGE 65 FOR APPROXIMATELY HALF THOSE RETIREES WHO ARE

ELIGIBLE FOR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. CERTAIN EMPLOYEE GROUPS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES COVERED BY MOST UNITED AUTO WORKERS BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, ARE PROVIDED LIFETIME HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.

EACH YEAR AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE, BASED ON A REVIEW OF INTEREST RATES ASSOCIATED WITH LONG-TERM HIGH QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS. THE DISCOUNT RATE DETERMINED ON EACH MEASUREMENT DATE IS USED TO CALCULATE THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AS OF THAT DATE, AND

IS ALSO USED TO CALCULATE THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT (INCOME)/COST FOR THE UPCOMING PLAN YEAR. THE PENSION AND OPB PLANS HAVE THE SAME DISCOUNT RATE FOR ALL PERIODS PRESENTED.

THE PENSION FUNDS EXPECTED RETURN ON ASSETS ASSUMPTION IS DERIVED FROM AN EXTENSIVE STUDY CONDUCTED BY OUR TRUST INVESTMENTS

GROUP AND ITS ACTUARIES ON A PERIODIC BASIS. THE STUDY INCLUDES A REVIEW OF ACTUAL HISTORICAL RETURNS ACHIEVED BY THE PENSION TRUST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL ASSET CLASSES WITH CONSIDERATION GIVEN TO THE APPROPRIATE

INVESTMENT STRATEGY. WHILE THE STUDY GIVES APPROPRIATE CONSIDERATION TO RECENT TRUST PERFORMANCE AND HISTORICAL RETURNS, THE ASSUMPTION REPRESENTS A LONG-TERM PROSPECTIVE RETURN. THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS DETERMINED ON EACH MEASUREMENT DATE

IS USED TO CALCULATE THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT (INCOME)/COST FOR THE UPCOMING PLAN YEAR.

PLAN ASSETS

PENSION ASSETS TOTALED $38,977 AND $33,209 AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003. PENSION

TABLE OF CONTENTS

INVESTMENT MANAGERS ARE RETAINED WITH A SPECIFIC INVESTMENT ROLE AND CORRESPONDING INVESTMENT GUIDELINES. INVESTMENT MANAGERS HAVE THE ABILITY TO PURCHASE SECURITIES

ON BEHALF OF THE PENSION TRUSTS, AND SEVERAL OF THEM HAVE PERMISSION TO INVEST IN DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS EQUITY OR BOND FUTURES. DERIVATIVES ARE SOMETIMES USED BY THE PENSION PLANS TO ACHIEVE THE EQUIVALENT MARKET EXPOSURE OF OWNING A SECURITY OR TO

REBALANCE THE TOTAL PORTFOLIO TO THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION. DERIVATIVES ARE MORE COST-EFFECTIVE INVESTMENT ALTERNATIVES WHEN COMPARED TO OWNING THE CORRESPONDING SECURITY. IN THE INSTANCES IN WHICH DERIVATIVES ARE USED, CASH BALANCES MUST BE

MAINTAINED AT A LEVEL EQUAL TO THE NOTIONAL EXPOSURE OF THE DERIVATIVES.

THE ACTUAL ALLOCATIONS FOR THE PENSION ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003, AND TARGET ALLOCATIONS BY ASSET CATEGORY, ARE AS FOLLOWS.

DURING 2004 THE INVESTMENT

STRATEGY CHANGED TO DECREASE THE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE ALLOCATIONS AND INCREASE THE DEBT AND OTHER ALLOCATIONS. REAL ESTATE INCLUDES INVESTMENTS IN PRIVATE REAL ESTATE INVESTMENTS. THE OTHER CATEGORY INCLUDES PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND HEDGE

FUNDS. ACTUAL INVESTMENT ALLOCATIONS VARY FROM TARGET ALLOCATIONS DUE TO PERIODIC INVESTMENT STRATEGY CHANGES AND DUE TO THE NATURE OF SOME ASSET CLASSES SUCH AS REAL ESTATE AND PRIVATE EQUITY WHERE IT COULD TAKE A PERIOD OF A FEW YEARS TO REACH THE

TARGETS. ADDITIONALLY, ACTUAL AND TARGET ALLOCATIONS VARY DUE TO THE TIMING OF BENEFIT PAYMENTS OR CONTRIBUTIONS MADE ON OR NEAR THE MEASUREMENT DATE, SEPTEMBER 30.

EQUITY INCLUDES DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITY SECURITIES, SUCH AS COMMON, PREFERRED OR OTHER CAPITAL STOCK, AS WELL AS EQUITY

FUTURES, CURRENCY FORWARDS AND RESIDUAL CASH ALLOCATED TO THE EQUITY MANAGERS. EQUITY INCLUDES OUR COMMON STOCK IN THE AMOUNTS OF $1,613 (4.19% OF PLAN ASSETS) AND $1,102 (3.3% OF PLAN ASSETS) AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003. EQUITY DERIVATIVES BASED

ON NET NOTIONAL AMOUNTS TOTALED 3.0% AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND WAS INSIGNIFICANT AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2003.

DEBT INCLUDES DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL DEBT SECURITIES, SUCH AS U.S. TREASURY SECURITIES, U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCY SECURITIES, CORPORATE BONDS AND COMMERCIAL PAPER; CASH EQUIVALENTS; INVESTMENTS IN BOND

DERIVATIVES SUCH AS BOND FUTURES, OPTIONS, SWAPS AND CURRENCY FORWARDS; AND REDEEMABLE PREFERRED STOCK AND CONVERTIBLE DEBT. DEBT INCLUDES $1,175 IN CASH WE CONTRIBUTED ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2003; SUBSEQUENTLY, THESE FUNDS WERE ALLOCATED TO EQUITY AND

DEBT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ASSET ALLOCATION NEEDS AT THE TIME. BOND DERIVATIVES BASED ON NET NOTIONAL AMOUNTS TOTALED 4.6% AND 1.9% OF PLAN ASSETS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003.

MOST OF THE TRUSTS INVESTMENT MANAGERS, WHO INVEST IN DEBT SECURITIES, INVEST IN TO-BE-ANNOUNCED MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES (TBA). A TBA REPRESENTS A CONTRACT TO BUY OR SELL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES TO BE DELIVERED AT A FUTURE AGREED UPON DATE. TBAS ARE DEEMED ECONOMICALLY EQUIVALENT TO PURCHASING MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES OUTRIGHT, BUT ARE OFTEN MORE

ATTRACTIVELY PRICED IN COMPARISON TO TRADITIONAL MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. IF THE INVESTMENT MANAGER WISHES TO MAINTAIN A CERTAIN LEVEL OF INVESTMENT IN TBA SECURITIES, THE MANAGER WILL SELL THEM PRIOR TO SETTLEMENT AND BUY NEW TBAS FOR ANOTHER

FUTURE SETTLEMENT; THIS APPROACH IS TERMED ROLLING. MOST OF THE TBA SECURITIES HELD WERE RELATED TO TBA ROLL STRATEGIES. DEBT INCLUDED $1,632 AND $1,936 RELATED TO TBA SECURITIES AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HELD $72 AND $58 IN TRUST FUND ASSETS FOR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS AT SEPTEMBER 30, 2004 AND 2003.

MOST OF THESE FUNDS ARE INVESTED IN A BALANCED INDEX FUND WHICH IS COMPRISED OF APPROXIMATELY 60% EQUITIES AND 40% DEBT SECURITIES. THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON THESE ASSETS DOES NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST.

CASH FLOWS

CONTRIBUTIONS

REQUIRED PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) REGULATIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED

TO BE MATERIAL IN 2005. HOWEVER, WE MADE A DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTION TO OUR PLANS OF $450 (PRE-TAX) ON FEBRUARY 4, 2005, AND PLAN TO MAKE APPROXIMATELY $550 (PRE-TAX) IN ADDITIONAL CONTRIBUTIONS LATER IN THE YEAR. WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE

APPROXIMATELY $17 TO OUR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS IN 2005.

TERMINATION PROVISIONS

CERTAIN OF THE PENSION PLANS PROVIDE THAT, IN THE EVENT THERE IS A CHANGE IN CONTROL

OF THE COMPANY WHICH IS NOT APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE PLANS ARE TERMINATED WITHIN FIVE YEARS THEREAFTER, THE ASSETS IN THE PLAN FIRST WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS REQUIRED BY ERISA, AND THEN ANY SURPLUS

WILL BE USED TO FUND A TRUST TO CONTINUE PRESENT AND FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS IN OUR GROUP INSURANCE BENEFIT PROGRAMS.

WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN PENSION PLANS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, SHOULD WE TERMINATE ANY OF

THE PLANS UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE PLANS ASSETS EXCEED THAT PLANS OBLIGATIONS, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL BE ENTITLED TO A FAIR ALLOCATION OF ANY OF THE PLANS ASSETS BASED ON PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE REIMBURSED UNDER U.S.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. ALSO, THE REVENUE RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1990 IMPOSES A 20% NON-DEDUCTIBLE EXCISE TAX ON THE GROSS ASSETS REVERTED IF WE ESTABLISH A QUALIFIED REPLACEMENT PLAN OR AMEND THE TERMINATING PLAN TO PROVIDE FOR BENEFIT INCREASES;

OTHERWISE, A 50% TAX IS APPLIED. ANY NET AMOUNT WE RETAIN IS TREATED AS TAXABLE INCOME.

401(K)

WE PROVIDE CERTAIN DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS TO

ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. THE PRINCIPAL PLANS ARE THE COMPANY-SPONSORED 401(K) PLANS AND AN UNFUNDED PLAN FOR UNUSED SICK LEAVE. THE PROVISION FOR THESE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS WAS $468, $464 AND $448 IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

WITH EMPLOYEE SERVICE. THESE STOCK UNITS PRINCIPALLY REPRESENT A METHOD OF DEFERRING EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION BY WHICH A LIABILITY IS ESTABLISHED BASED UPON THE CURRENT STOCK PRICE. AN EXPENSE OR REDUCTION IN EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ASSOCIATED WITH THE

CHANGE IN THAT LIABILITY BALANCE. THE (INCREASE)/REDUCTION IN EXPENSE RELATED TO DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION WAS $(72), $(68) AND $42 IN 2004, 2003 AND 2002, RESPECTIVELY.

PERFORMANCE SHARES

PERFORMANCE SHARES ARE STOCK UNITS THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE TO COMMON STOCK CONTINGENT UPON STOCK PRICE PERFORMANCE. IF, AT ANY TIME UP TO FIVE YEARS AFTER AWARD, THE

STOCK PRICE REACHES AND MAINTAINS A PRICE EQUAL TO 161.0% OF THE STOCK ISSUE PRICE AT THE DATE OF THE AWARD (REPRESENTING A GROWTH RATE OF 10% COMPOUNDED ANNUALLY FOR FIVE YEARS), 25% OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED ARE CONVERTIBLE TO COMMON

STOCK. LIKEWISE, AT STOCK PRICES EQUAL TO 168.5%, 176.2%, 184.2%, 192.5% AND 201.1% OF THE STOCK PRICE AT THE DATE OF AWARD, THE CUMULATIVE PORTION OF AWARDED PERFORMANCE SHARES CONVERTIBLE TO COMMON STOCK ARE 40%, 55%, 75%, 100% AND 125%,

RESPECTIVELY. PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDS NOT CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK EXPIRE FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF THE AWARD; HOWEVER, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY, AT ITS DISCRETION, ALLOW VESTING OF UP TO 100% OF THE TARGET

PERFORMANCE SHARES IF OUR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (STOCK PRICE APPRECIATION PLUS DIVIDENDS) DURING THE FIVE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF THE S&P 500 OVER THE SAME PERIOD.

BEGINNING WITH OUR 2003 GRANTS, ALL NEW PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED ARE SUBJECT TO

DIFFERENT TERMS AND CONDITIONS FROM THOSE PREVIOUSLY REPORTED. IF AT ANY TIME UP TO FIVE YEARS AFTER AWARD THE STOCK PRICE REACHES AND MAINTAINS FOR TWENTY CONSECUTIVE DAYS A PRICE EQUAL TO A CUMULATIVE GROWTH RATE OF 40% ABOVE THE GRANT PRICE, 15%

OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED ARE CONVERTIBLE TO COMMON STOCK. LIKEWISE, AT CUMULATIVE GROWTH RATES ABOVE THE GRANT PRICE EQUAL TO 50%, 60%, 70%, 80%, 90%, 100%, 110%, 120% AND 125%, THE CUMULATIVE PORTION OF AWARDED SHARES CONVERTIBLE TO COMMON

STOCK ARE 30%, 45%, 60%, 75%, 90%, 100%, 110%, 120% AND 125%, RESPECTIVELY. PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDS NOT CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK EXPIRE FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF THE AWARD. IN THE EVENT ALL STOCK PRICE HURDLES HAVE NOT BEEN MET, AT THE END OF

THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, UNVESTED SHARES MAY VEST BASED ON OUR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN (TSR) PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO THE S&P 500. IF LESS THAN 125% OF THE

103

TABLE OF CONTENTS

GRANT HAS VESTED AT THE END OF THE FIVE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD, AN AWARD FORMULA WILL BE APPLIED TO THE INITIAL GRANT BASED ON THE PERCENTILE RANK OF OUR TSR RELATIVE

TO THE S&P 500. THIS CAN RESULT IN A VESTING OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARD UP TO A TOTAL OF 125% AND ONLY APPLIES IF (1) OUR TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN DURING THE FIVE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD MEETS OR EXCEEDS THE MEDIAN TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN

OF THE S&P 500 OVER THE SAME PERIOD AND (2) TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN IS IN EXCESS OF THE FIVE-YEAR TREASURY BILL RATE AT THE START OF THE FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.

DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, OUR STOCK PRICE MET THE 70% CUMULATIVE GROWTH RATE LEVEL FOR PERFORMANCE SHARE GRANTS MADE IN 2003.

ACCORDINGLY, PURSUANT TO THE PLANS TERMS, 60% OF THE 2003 PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED WERE CONVERTED TO 5,316,363 SHARES OF COMMON STOCK. IN ADDITION, FOR THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE RECORDED AN ADDITIONAL $57 OF COMPENSATION

EXPENSE TO REFLECT THE CUMULATIVE EXPENSE FOR THOSE PERFORMANCE SHARES CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK.

SHAREVALUE TRUST

THE SHAREVALUE TRUST, ESTABLISHED EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 1996, IS A 14-YEAR IRREVOCABLE

TRUST THAT HOLDS BOEING COMMON STOCK, RECEIVES DIVIDENDS AND DISTRIBUTES TO EMPLOYEES APPRECIATION IN VALUE ABOVE A 3% PER ANNUM THRESHOLD RATE OF RETURN. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE TRUST HELD 38,982,205 SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, SPLIT BETWEEN

TWO FUNDS, FUND 1 AND FUND 2. ON JUNE 30, 2004, THE MARKET VALUE OF FUND 2 EXCEEDED $913 (THE THRESHOLD REPRESENTING A 3% PER ANNUM RATE OF RETURN). BASED ON THE AVERAGE STOCK PRICE OF $50.825 AS OF JUNE 30, 2004, THE MARKET

VALUE OF FUND 2 EXCEEDED THE THRESHOLD BY $143 RESULTING IN A DISTRIBUTION TO PARTICIPANTS. THE DISTRIBUTION WAS PAID IN BOEING COMMON STOCK, EXCEPT FOR PARTIAL SHARES, DISTRIBUTIONS TO FOREIGN EMPLOYEES AND BENEFICIARIES OF DECEASED PARTICIPANTS,

WHICH WERE PAID IN CASH. AFTER EMPLOYEE WITHHOLDING TAXES, APPROXIMATELY 1.7 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE DISTRIBUTED TO PARTICIPANTS. THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE RECORDED AS A DEDUCTION FROM ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL.

IF ON JUNE 30, 2006, THE MARKET VALUE OF FUND 1 EXCEEDS $1,004, THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF

THE THRESHOLD WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO EMPLOYEES. SHARES HELD BY THE TRUST ON JUNE 30, 2010, AFTER FINAL DISTRIBUTION WILL REVERT BACK TO US.

SIMILARLY, IF ON JUNE 30, 2008, THE MARKET VALUE OF FUND 2 EXCEEDS $1,028, THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE THRESHOLD WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO EMPLOYEES. SHARES HELD BY

THE TRUST ON JUNE 30, 2010, AFTER FINAL DISTRIBUTION WILL REVERT BACK TO US.

THE SHAREVALUE TRUST IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CONTRA-EQUITY ACCOUNT AND STATED AT MARKET VALUE. MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ARE OFFSET TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL.

NOTE 18  SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

IN DECEMBER 2000, A STOCK REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS AUTHORIZED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, AUTHORIZING THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO 85 MILLION SHARES OF OUR STOCK. WE

REPURCHASED 14,708,856 SHARES DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004. WE DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002.

NOTE 19  DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

WE ACCOUNT FOR DERIVATIVES PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

, AS AMENDED. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES THAT ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS BE RECOGNIZED IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE REGARDLESS OF THE PURPOSE OR INTENT FOR HOLDING THEM.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE ARE EXPOSED TO A VARIETY OF MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES, FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES AND COMMODITY PRICES. THESE EXPOSURES ARE MANAGED, IN PART, WITH THE USE OF DERIVATIVES. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF OUR RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND THE EFFECTS OF THESE STRATEGIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CASH FLOW HEDGES

OUR CASH FLOW HEDGES INCLUDE CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS, CROSS CURRENCY SWAPS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS, AND COMMODITY

PURCHASE CONTRACTS. INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS UNDER WHICH WE AGREE TO PAY FIXED RATES OF INTEREST ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF VARIABLE-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS. WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MANAGE CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED

WITH CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFICALLY SALES AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS MADE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HEDGE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS PRINCIPALLY OCCURRING UP TO FIVE YEARS IN THE FUTURE. WE USE COMMODITY

DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS FIXED-PRICE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, TO HEDGE AGAINST POTENTIALLY UNFAVORABLE PRICE CHANGES FOR ITEMS USED IN PRODUCTION. THESE INCLUDE COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE ELECTRICITY AT FIXED PRICES THROUGH DECEMBER 2005. THE CHANGES IN FAIR

VALUE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF THE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED IN A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS IMMEDIATELY. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REPORTED IN EARNINGS FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004,

2003 AND 2002.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, NET GAINS OF $35 AND $5

(NET OF TAX) WERE RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME/LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS. INEFFECTIVENESS FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES WAS INSIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002. FOR THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, LOSSES OF $16, $20 AND $46 (NET OF TAX) WERE RECLASSIFIED TO COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. BASED ON OUR CURRENT PORTFOLIO OF CASH FLOW HEDGES, WE EXPECT TO RECLASSIFY TO COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES A GAIN

OF $14 (NET OF TAX) DURING THE NEXT YEAR.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

INTEREST RATE SWAPS UNDER WHICH WE AGREE TO PAY VARIABLE RATES OF INTEREST ARE

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE DEBT. THE NET CHANGE IN FAIR VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES AND THE HEDGED ITEMS IS REPORTED IN EARNINGS. INEFFECTIVENESS RELATED TO THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS WAS INSIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2004, 2003 AND 2002.

FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND

2002, $24, $13 AND $5 OF GAINS RELATED TO THE BASIS ADJUSTMENT OF CERTAIN TERMINATED INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND FORWARD-STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS WERE AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS, RESPECTIVELY.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECEIVING HEDGE TREATMENT

WE ALSO HOLD CERTAIN NON-HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS INTEREST EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS, INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WARRANTS, CONVERSION FEATURE

OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT AND FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS. THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, THESE NON-HEDGING INSTRUMENTS RESULTED IN GAINS OF $19, $38

AND $25.

WE HELD FORWARD-STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO FIX

THE COST OF FUNDING A FIRMLY COMMITTED LEASE FOR WHICH PAYMENT TERMS ARE DETERMINED IN ADVANCE OF FUNDING. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, THE FORWARD-STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS NO LONGER QUALIFIED FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGE ACCOUNTING

TREATMENT. AS A RESULT, WE RECOGNIZED A PRE-TAX CHARGE OF $21. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, INEFFECTIVENESS LOSSES OF $1 AND $8 WERE RECORDED IN INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE FORWARD-STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

NOTE 20  ARRANGEMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK

WE ENTER INTO ARRANGEMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK IN THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, AS DISCUSSED BELOW. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE

PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF GUARANTEES, ETC INVESTMENTS, AND PRODUCT WARRANTIES.

RELATING TO A GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING FOR AND DISCLOSURES OF CERTAIN GUARANTEES WAS ISSUED. FIN 45 REQUIRES ENHANCED DISCLOSURES FOR CERTAIN GUARANTEES. IT ALSO REQUIRES CERTAIN GUARANTEES THAT ARE ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002,

INCLUDING THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES, TO BE INITIALLY RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. FOR GUARANTEES ISSUED ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 31, 2002, LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED WHEN AND IF PAYMENTS BECOME PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. FIN 45 HAS THE GENERAL

EFFECT OF DELAYING RECOGNITION FOR A PORTION OF THE REVENUE FOR PRODUCT SALES THAT ARE ACCOMPANIED BY CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION PROVISIONS BECAME EFFECTIVE PROSPECTIVELY BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2003. DURING

2004 AND 2003, THE FAIR VALUE OF GUARANTEES WE ISSUED WAS NOT MATERIAL.

THIRD-PARTY

GUARANTEES

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE DATA REGARDING

OUR THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES. THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL PAYMENTS REPRESENT A WORST-CASE SCENARIO, AND DO NOT NECESSARILY REFLECT OUR EXPECTED RESULTS. ESTIMATED PROCEEDS FROM COLLATERAL AND RECOURSE REPRESENT THE ANTICIPATED VALUES OF ASSETS

WE COULD LIQUIDATE OR RECEIVE FROM OTHER PARTIES TO OFFSET OUR PAYMENTS UNDER GUARANTEES. THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF LIABILITIES RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET REFLECTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE PAYMENTS WE MAY INCUR AS PART OF FULFILLING OUR GUARANTEE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNING A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF NEW AIRCRAFT (SALE AIRCRAFT), WE HAVE ENTERED

INTO SPECIFIED-PRICE TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO TRADE IN USED AIRCRAFT FOR THE PURCHASE OF SALE AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS

WHEREIN WE AGREE TO REPURCHASE THE SALE AIRCRAFT AT A SPECIFIED PRICE, GENERALLY TEN YEARS AFTER DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT. OUR REPURCHASE OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT IS CONTINGENT UPON A FUTURE, MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL

NEW AIRCRAFT. IF, IN THE FUTURE, WE EXECUTE AN AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT, AND IF THE CUSTOMER EXERCISES ITS RIGHT TO SELL THE SALE AIRCRAFT TO US, A CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENT WOULD BECOME A TRADE-IN COMMITMENT.

CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS AND TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS ARE NOW INCLUDED IN OUR GUARANTEES DISCUSSION BASED ON OUR CURRENT ANALYSIS OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS. BASED ON OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, WE BELIEVE THAT VERY FEW, IF ANY, OF OUR

OUTSTANDING CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WILL ULTIMATELY BECOME TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS.

EXPOSURE RELATED TO THE TRADE-IN OF USED AIRCRAFT RESULTING FROM TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS MAY TAKE THE FORM OF: (1) ADJUSTMENTS TO REVENUE RELATED TO THE SALE OF NEW AIRCRAFT DETERMINED AT THE SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT,

AND/OR (2) CHARGES TO COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RELATED TO ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT THAT OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR NEW AIRCRAFT BUT PRIOR TO THE PURCHASE OF THE USED TRADE-IN

AIRCRAFT. THE TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT EXPOSURE INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES IN THE TABLES ABOVE IS RELATED TO ITEM (2) ABOVE.

THERE IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS. THE PROBABILITY THAT TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WILL BE

EXERCISED IS DETERMINED BY USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION FROM VALUATION SOURCES AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES AND IS CONTINUALLY ASSESSED BY MANAGEMENT. AS DISCLOSED IN THE ABOVE TABLE, THE MAXIMUM AMOUNTS PAYABLE UNDER

TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WERE $972 AND $1,279 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003. BASED ON THE BEST MARKET INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, IT WAS PROBABLE THAT WE WOULD BE OBLIGATED TO PERFORM ON TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WITH GROSS AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO

CUSTOMERS TOTALING $116 AND $582 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT RELATED TO PROBABLE CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WAS $91 AND $517 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER

LIABILITIES INCLUDED $25 AND $65 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, WHICH REPRESENTS THE EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS.

WE HAVE ISSUED VARIOUS ASSET-RELATED GUARANTEES, PRINCIPALLY TO FACILITATE THE SALE OF CERTAIN COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO

MAKE PAYMENTS TO A GUARANTEED PARTY IN THE EVENT THE RELATED AIRCRAFT FAIR VALUES FALL BELOW A SPECIFIED AMOUNT AT A FUTURE POINT IN TIME. THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE COLLATERALIZED PRINCIPALLY BY COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT, AND EXPIRE WITHIN THE NEXT 14 YEARS.

WE HAVE ISSUED CREDIT GUARANTEES TO CREDITORS OF THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE,

OF WHICH WE ARE A 40% PARTNER, TO ASSIST THE VENTURE IN OBTAINING FINANCING. WE HAVE SUBSTANTIVE GUARANTEES FROM THE OTHER VENTURE PARTNERS, WHO ARE OBLIGATED TO REIMBURSE US FOR THEIR SHARE (IN PROPORTION TO THEIR SEA LAUNCH OWNERSHIP PERCENTAGES)

OF ANY GUARANTEE PAYMENT WE MAY MAKE RELATED TO THE SEA LAUNCH OBLIGATIONS. SOME OF THESE GUARANTEES ARE ALSO COLLATERALIZED BY CERTAIN ASSETS OF THE VENTURE. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE ISSUED CREDIT GUARANTEES, PRINCIPALLY TO FACILITATE THE SALE OF

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO A GUARANTEED PARTY IN THE EVENT THAT LEASE OR LOAN PAYMENTS ARE NOT MADE BY THE ORIGINAL DEBTOR OR LESSEE. OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CREDIT-RELATED GUARANTEES ARE

COLLATERALIZED BY THE UNDERLYING COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THESE GUARANTEES HAS BEEN EXTENDED ON BEHALF OF ORIGINAL DEBTORS OR LESSEES WITH LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. CURRENT OUTSTANDING CREDIT GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHIN

THE NEXT 11 YEARS.

RELATING TO OUR ETC INVESTMENTS, WE HAVE POTENTIAL

OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO SHORTFALL INTEREST PAYMENTS IN THE EVENT THAT THE INTEREST RATES IN THE UNDERLYING AGREEMENTS ARE RESET BELOW LEVELS SPECIFIED IN THESE AGREEMENTS. THESE OBLIGATIONS WOULD CEASE IF UNITED WERE TO DEFAULT ON ITS INTEREST

PAYMENTS TO THE TRUST. THESE GUARANTEES WILL EXPIRE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 YEARS.

109

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HAD CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS TO INVESTORS IN THE TRUSTS AS A LIQUIDITY PROVIDER FOR ETC PASS-THROUGH ARRANGEMENTS,

WHICH REQUIRED FUNDING TO THE TRUST TO COVER INTEREST DUE TO SUCH INVESTORS IN THE EVENT OF DEFAULT BY UNITED. IN THE EVENT OF FUNDING, WE ARE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE A FIRST PRIORITY POSITION IN THE ETC COLLATERAL IN THE AMOUNT OF THE FUNDING. ON

FEBRUARY 7, 2003, WE ADVANCED $101 TO THE TRUST PERFECTING OUR COLLATERAL POSITION AND TERMINATING OUR LIQUIDITY OBLIGATION. ON AUGUST 9, 2004, THE BANK OF NEW YORK, ACTING AS THE COLLATERAL AGENT, REIMBURSED US FOR THIS ADVANCE WITH A TOTAL PAYMENT

OF $107. THE PAYMENT INCLUDED THE ORIGINAL ADVANCED AMOUNT, AS WELL AS INTEREST INCOME RELATED TO THE ADVANCE.

WE HAVE OUTSTANDING PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS. PURSUANT TO THESE GUARANTEES, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS IN THE EVENT A THIRD-PARTY FAILS TO

PERFORM SPECIFIED SERVICES. CURRENT PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHIN THE NEXT 13 YEARS.

PRODUCT WARRANTIES

WE PROVIDE PRODUCT WARRANTIES IN

CONJUNCTION WITH CERTAIN PRODUCT SALES. THE MAJORITY OF OUR WARRANTIES ARE ISSUED BY OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT. GENERALLY, AIRCRAFT SALES ARE ACCOMPANIED BY A THREE- TO FOUR-YEAR STANDARD WARRANTY FOR SYSTEMS, ACCESSORIES, EQUIPMENT, PARTS

AND SOFTWARE MANUFACTURED BY US OR MANUFACTURED TO CERTAIN STANDARDS UNDER OUR AUTHORIZATION. ADDITIONALLY, ON OCCASION WE HAVE MADE COMMITMENTS BEYOND THE STANDARD WARRANTY OBLIGATION TO CORRECT FLEET WIDE MAJOR WARRANTY ISSUES OF A PARTICULAR

MODEL. THESE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAMS ESTIMATE AT COMPLETION (EAC) AND EXPENSED AS AIRCRAFT ARE DELIVERED. THESE WARRANTIES COVER FACTORS SUCH AS NON-CONFORMANCE TO SPECIFICATIONS AND DEFECTS IN MATERIAL AND DESIGN. WARRANTIES ISSUED

BY OUR IDS SEGMENT PRINCIPALLY RELATE TO SALES OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND WEAPONS HARDWARE. THESE SALES ARE GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A SIX TO TWELVE-MONTH WARRANTY PERIOD AND COVER SYSTEMS, ACCESSORIES, EQUIPMENT, PARTS AND SOFTWARE MANUFACTURED BY US

TO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL SPECIFICATIONS. THESE WARRANTIES COVER FACTORS SUCH AS NON-CONFORMANCE TO SPECIFICATIONS AND DEFECTS IN MATERIAL AND WORKMANSHIP.

ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO STANDARD WARRANTIES ARE RECORDED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE RELATED PRODUCT SALES OCCUR. THE WARRANTY LIABILITY RECORDED AT EACH BALANCE

SHEET DATE REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF MONTHS OF WARRANTY COVERAGE OUTSTANDING FOR PRODUCTS DELIVERED TIMES THE AVERAGE OF HISTORICAL MONTHLY WARRANTY PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS FOR CERTAIN MAJOR WARRANTY ISSUES THAT EXCEED A

NORMAL CLAIMS LEVEL. THE FOLLOWING TABLE SUMMARIZES PRODUCT WARRANTY ACTIVITY RECORDED DURING 2004 AND 2003.

MATERIAL VARIABLE INTERESTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

OUR INVESTMENTS IN ETCS, EETCS AND SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITIES (SPES) CONTINUE TO BE INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF REVISED INTERPRETATION NO.

46 (FIN 46(R)),

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES

. ALL ENTITIES THAT WERE REQUIRED TO BE CONSOLIDATED UNDER FIN 46(R) HAD BEEN PREVIOUSLY CONSOLIDATED AND THEREFORE, THE ADOPTION OF FIN 46(R) HAD NO IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FROM 1999 THROUGH 2004, WE INVESTED IN ETCS AND

EETCS, WHICH ARE TRUSTS THAT PASSIVELY HOLD DEBT INVESTMENTS FOR A LARGE NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT TO ENHANCE LIQUIDITY FOR INVESTORS, WHO IN TURN PASS THIS LIQUIDITY BENEFIT DIRECTLY TO AIRLINES IN THE FORM OF LOWER COUPON AND/OR GREATER DEBT CAPACITY.

ETCS AND EETCS PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH TRANCHED RIGHTS TO CASH FLOWS FROM A FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT, AS WELL AS A COLLATERAL POSITION IN THE RELATED ASSET. OUR INVESTMENTS IN ETCS AND EETCS DO NOT REQUIRE CONSOLIDATION UNDER FIN 46(R). WE BELIEVE THAT

OUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO ECONOMIC LOSS FROM ETCS AND EETCS IS $349, COMPRISED OF OUR $321 INVESTMENT BALANCE AND A MAXIMUM POTENTIAL EXPOSURE OF $28 RELATING TO POTENTIAL SHORTFALL INTEREST PAYMENTS. ACCOUNTING LOSSES, IF ANY, FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD

COULD DIFFER. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, THE ETC AND EETC TRANSACTIONS WE PARTICIPATED IN HAD TOTAL ASSETS OF $3,916 AND TOTAL DEBT (WHICH IS NON-RECOURSE TO US) OF $3,595. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE RECORDED REVENUES OF $28 AND CASH

FLOWS OF $70.

FROM 1998 THROUGH 2004, WE PROVIDED SUBORDINATED LOANS TO

CERTAIN SPES THAT ARE UTILIZED BY THE AIRLINES, LENDERS AND LOAN GUARANTORS, INCLUDING, FOR EXAMPLE, THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES. ALL OF THESE SPES ARE INCLUDED IN THE SCOPE OF FIN 46(R); HOWEVER, ONLY CERTAIN SPES REQUIRE

CONSOLIDATION. SPE ARRANGEMENTS ARE UTILIZED TO ISOLATE INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTIONS FOR LEGAL LIABILITY OR TAX PURPOSES, OR TO PERFECT SECURITY INTERESTS FROM OUR PERSPECTIVE, AS WELL AS, IN SOME CASES, THAT OF A THIRD-PARTY LENDER IN CERTAIN LEVERAGED

LEASE TRANSACTIONS. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO ECONOMIC LOSS FROM NON-CONSOLIDATED SPE ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES (VIES) IS $43, WHICH REPRESENTS OUR INVESTMENT BALANCE.

ACCOUNTING LOSSES, IF ANY, FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD COULD DIFFER. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004,

THESE SPE ARRANGEMENTS HAD TOTAL ASSETS OF $451 AND TOTAL DEBT (WHICH IS NON-RECOURSE TO US) OF $408. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, WE RECORDED REVENUES OF $3 AND CASH FLOWS OF $28.

INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS

WE UTILIZE INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS (IRBS) ISSUED BY THE CITY OF WICHITA TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE AND/OR CONSTRUCTION OF REAL AND

PERSONAL PROPERTY AT OUR WICHITA SITE. TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH IRBS INCLUDE A PROVISION FOR A TEN-YEAR PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT AND A SALES TAX EXEMPTION FROM THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE. WE RECORD THE PROPERTY ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS

OF FINANCIAL POSITION, ALONG WITH A CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION TO REPAY THE PROCEEDS OF THE IRB. WE HAVE ALSO PURCHASED THE IRBS AND THEREFORE ARE THE BONDHOLDER AS WELL AS THE BORROWER/LESSEE OF THE PROPERTY PURCHASED WITH THE IRB PROCEEDS.

WE ALSO HAVE A SIMILAR ARRANGEMENT IN PLACE WITH THE DEVELOPMENT

AUTHORITY OF FULTON COUNTY, GEORGIA WHERE WE ARE BOTH BORROWER AND BONDHOLDER. TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE IRBS ARE THE PROVISION OF A TEN-YEAR PARTIAL PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT.

THE CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION AND IRB ASSET ARE RECORDED NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION PURSUANT TO FIN 39,

OFFSETTING OF AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN CONTRACTS

. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CITY OF WICHITA IRBS WERE $2,852 AND $2,897, AND THE AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FULTON COUNTY IRBS WERE $19.

OTHER COMMITMENTS

IRREVOCABLE FINANCING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER, INCLUDING OPTIONS, SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY THROUGH 2007 TOTALED $6,661 AND $1,495 AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2004 AND 2003. WE ANTICIPATE THAT NOT ALL OF THESE COMMITMENTS WILL BE UTILIZED AND THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO ARRANGE FOR THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS TO ASSUME A PORTION OF THE REMAINING COMMITMENTS, IF NECESSARY. WE HAD NO SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS TO

ARRANGE FOR EQUIPMENT FINANCING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003.

AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, FUTURE LEASE COMMITMENTS ON AIRCRAFT AND OTHER COMMITMENTS NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION TOTALED $483 AND $524. THESE LEASE COMMITMENTS EXTEND THROUGH 2020, AND OUR INTENT IS TO RECOVER

THESE LEASE COMMITMENTS THROUGH SUBLEASE ARRANGEMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDED $89 AND $96 ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADVERSE COMMITMENTS UNDER THESE LEASE ARRANGEMENTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2003, WE HAD EXTENDED A $69 CREDIT LINE AGREEMENT TO ONE OF OUR

JOINT VENTURE PARTNERS. AS OF DECEMBER 30, 2004, THIS LINE OF CREDIT HAD BEEN CLOSED.

WE INSURE OUR EXECUTIVES WITH COMPANY OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (COLI). WE HAVE THE RIGHT TO OFFSET THE LOANS AGAINST THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE WITH THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE AND PRESENT THE NET LIABILITY OR ASSET ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE WAS $1,468 AND $1,294 AND THE LOANS AGAINST THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE WERE $1,356 AND $1,224, RESPECTIVELY. THE CASH SURRENDER VALUE NET OF THESE LOANS, IS

RECORDED IN OTHER ASSETS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003.

NOTE 21  SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK

CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INVOLVING POTENTIAL

CREDIT RISK ARE PREDOMINANTLY WITH COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. OF THE $15,654 IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND CUSTOMER FINANCING INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, $10,750

RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS ($246 OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND $10,504 OF CUSTOMER FINANCING) AND $2,701 RELATED TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. OF THE $10,504 OF AIRCRAFT CUSTOMER FINANCING, $9,770 RELATED TO CUSTOMERS WE BELIEVE HAVE LESS THAN

INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. AIRTRAN AIRWAYS, AMR CORPORATION, AND UNITED WERE ASSOCIATED WITH 14%, 12% AND 11%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR AIRCRAFT FINANCING PORTFOLIO. FINANCING FOR AIRCRAFT IS COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITY IN THE RELATED ASSET, AND

HISTORICALLY WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED A PROBLEM IN ACCESSING SUCH COLLATERAL.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 20 PREDOMINANTLY RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS. SIMILARLY, ALL OF THE $6,661 OF IRREVOCABLE FINANCING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER

INCLUDING OPTIONS RELATED TO CUSTOMERS WE BELIEVE HAVE LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT.

OTHER RISK

THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT IS SUBJECT

TO BOTH OPERATIONAL AND EXTERNAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT RISKS. OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT CAN DISRUPT ITS ABILITY TO MAKE TIMELY DELIVERY OF ITS COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT AND MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS INCLUDE EXECUTION OF INTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS,

PRODUCT PERFORMANCE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY CERTIFICATIONS OF ITS COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, OTHER REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES, COLLECTIVE BARGAINING LABOR DISPUTES, PERFORMANCE ISSUES WITH KEY

SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS AND THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY RESOURCES, SUCH AS ELECTRICAL POWER. AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS, PARTICULARLY NEW AIRCRAFT MODELS, FACE THE ADDITIONAL RISK OF PRICING PRESSURES AND COST MANAGEMENT ISSUES INHERENT IN THE

DESIGN AND PRODUCTION OF COMPLEX PRODUCTS. FINANCING SUPPORT MAY BE PROVIDED BY US TO AIRLINES, SOME OF WHICH

112

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN OTHER FINANCING. EXTERNAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT RISKS INCLUDE ADVERSE GOVERNMENTAL EXPORT AND IMPORT POLICIES, FACTORS THAT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT

AND PROLONGED DISRUPTION TO AIR TRAVEL WORLDWIDE AND OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY. EXAMPLES OF FACTORS RELATING TO EXTERNAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT RISKS INCLUDE THE VOLATILITY OF AIRCRAFT FUEL

PRICES, GLOBAL TRADE POLICIES, WORLDWIDE POLITICAL STABILITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, ACTS OF AGGRESSION THAT IMPACT THE PERCEIVED SAFETY OF COMMERCIAL FLIGHT, ESCALATION TRENDS INHERENT IN PRICING OUR AIRCRAFT AND A COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY STRUCTURE WHICH

RESULTS IN MARKET PRESSURE TO REDUCE PRODUCT PRICES.

IN ADDITION TO THE

FOREGOING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT, THE IDS BUSINESSES ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGING PRIORITIES OR REDUCTIONS IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE AND SPACE BUDGET, AND TERMINATION OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS DUE TO UNILATERAL

GOVERNMENT ACTION (TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE) OR FAILURE TO PERFORM (TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT). CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING FINES, COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION, FORFEITURE AND SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT FROM

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS MAY RESULT FROM VIOLATIONS OF BUSINESS AND COST CLASSIFICATION REGULATIONS ON U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

THE COMMERCIAL LAUNCH AND SATELLITE SERVICE MARKETS HAVE SOME DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY SINCE GLOBAL DEMAND IS DRIVEN IN PART BY THE LAUNCH CUSTOMERS ACCESS TO

CAPITAL MARKETS. ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS FOR LAUNCH SERVICES RECEIVE DIRECT OR INDIRECT GOVERNMENT FUNDING. THE SATELLITE MARKET INCLUDES SOME DEGREE OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO THE ATTAINMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL SPECIFICATIONS

AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS.

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH BCC INCLUDES INTEREST

RATE RISKS, ASSET VALUATION RISKS, SPECIFICALLY, AIRCRAFT VALUATION RISKS, AND CREDIT AND COLLECTIBILITY RISKS OF COUNTERPARTIES.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, OUR PRINCIPAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WERE WITH THE INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS AND AEROSPACE WORKERS (IAM)

REPRESENTING 17% OF OUR EMPLOYEES (CURRENT AGREEMENTS EXPIRING IN SEPTEMBER AND OCTOBER 2005 AND MAY 2007); THE SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING EMPLOYEES IN AEROSPACE (SPEEA) REPRESENTING 14% OF OUR EMPLOYEES (CURRENT AGREEMENTS EXPIRING IN

DECEMBER 2005 AND FEBRUARY 2008); AND THE UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE AND AGRICULTURAL IMPLEMENT WORKERS OF AMERICA (UAW) REPRESENTING 4% OF OUR EMPLOYEES (CURRENT AGREEMENTS EXPIRING IN SEPTEMBER 2005 AND MAY AND OCTOBER 2007).

NOTE 22  DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE, INVESTMENTS,

AND NOTES RECEIVABLE BALANCES AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003 APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUE AS REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF DEBT, NET OF CAPITAL LEASES, WAS $11,884 AND $14,044 AND THE FAIR VALUE OF DEBT, BASED ON CURRENT MARKET

RATES FOR DEBT OF THE SAME RISK AND MATURITIES, WAS ESTIMATED AT $13,198 AND $15,301. OUR DEBT IS GENERALLY NOT CALLABLE UNTIL MATURITY.

WITH REGARD TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF FUTURE FINANCING COMMITMENTS BECAUSE THERE IS

NOT A MARKET FOR SUCH FUTURE COMMITMENTS. OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING ASSET-RELATED GUARANTEES, CREDIT GUARANTEES, AND INTEREST RATE GUARANTEES RELATED TO AN ETC, ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE A FAIR VALUE OF $165 AND $196 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

NOTE 23  CONTINGENCIES

LEGAL

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS, CONTRACTS AND OTHER MATTERS ARE PENDING AGAINST US. MOST SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO MATTERS COVERED BY OUR INSURANCE. MAJOR

CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS

WE

ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE RELATED TO PROCUREMENT ACTIVITIES AND THE ALLEGED POSSESSION AND MISUSE OF THIRD-PARTY PROPRIETARY DATA, FROM WHICH CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT OR

HAVE RESULTED. SUCH PROCEEDINGS INVOLVE, OR COULD INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES, COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION AND/OR FORFEITURES. UNDER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, A COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS OPERATING

DIVISIONS OR SUBDIVISIONS, CAN ALSO BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, OR LOSE ITS EXPORT PRIVILEGES, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS. WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON CURRENT INFORMATION, THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH GOVERNMENT

DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW.

A-12 LITIGATION

IN 1991, THE U.S. NAVY NOTIFIED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS (NOW ONE OF OUR SUBSIDIARIES) AND GENERAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION (THE TEAM) THAT

IT WAS TERMINATING FOR DEFAULT THE TEAMS CONTRACT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE A-12 AIRCRAFT. THE TEAM FILED A LEGAL ACTION TO CONTEST THE NAVYS DEFAULT TERMINATION, TO ASSERT ITS RIGHTS TO CONVERT THE TERMINATION TO ONE

FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND TO OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COSTS INCURRED ON THE A-12 CONTRACT BUT NOT PAID TO DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, INVENTORIES INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $583 OF RECORDED COSTS ON THE A-12

CONTRACT, AGAINST WHICH WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LOSS PROVISION OF $350. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVISION, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1990, WAS BASED ON MCDONNELL DOUGLAS BELIEF, SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE TERMINATION FOR

DEFAULT WOULD BE CONVERTED TO A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, AND THAT THE BEST ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE LOSS ON TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE WAS $350.

ON AUGUST 31, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ISSUED A DECISION AFTER TRIAL UPHOLDING THE GOVERNMENTS DEFAULT TERMINATION OF THE A-12 CONTRACT. THE

COURT DID NOT, HOWEVER, ENTER A MONEY JUDGMENT FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ON ITS CLAIM FOR UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS. IN 2003, THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT, FINDING THAT THE TRIAL COURT HAD APPLIED THE WRONG LEGAL STANDARD, VACATED

THE TRIAL COURTS 2001 DECISION AND ORDERED THE CASE SENT BACK TO THAT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. THIS FOLLOWS AN EARLIER TRIAL COURT DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE TEAM AND REVERSAL OF THAT INITIAL DECISION ON APPEAL.

IF, AFTER ALL JUDICIAL PROCEEDINGS HAVE ENDED, THE COURTS DETERMINE, CONTRARY TO OUR

BELIEF, THAT A TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WAS APPROPRIATE, WE WOULD INCUR AN ADDITIONAL LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $275, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF REMAINING INVENTORY COSTS AND ADJUSTMENTS, AND, IF THE COURTS FURTHER HOLD THAT A MONEY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE

ENTERED AGAINST THE TEAM, WE WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ONE-HALF OF THE UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS OF $1,350 PLUS STATUTORY INTEREST FROM FEBRUARY 1991 (CURRENTLY TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $1,150). IN THAT EVENT, OUR LOSS WOULD

TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $1,518 IN PRE-TAX CHARGES. SHOULD, HOWEVER, THE MARCH 31, 1998 JUDGMENT OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS IN FAVOR OF THE TEAM BE REINSTATED, WE WOULD RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY $1,001, INCLUDING INTEREST.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT IS CONTRARY TO LAW AND FACT AND THAT THE

LOSS PROVISION ESTABLISHED BY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS IN 1990, WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION FROM OUTSIDE COUNSEL, CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE REDUCTION IN VALUE OF A-12 NET CONTRACTS IN PROCESS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004.

FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE A-12 LITIGATION WILL DEPEND UPON THE OUTCOME OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS OR POSSIBLE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

EELV LITIGATION

IN 1999, TWO EMPLOYEES WERE FOUND TO HAVE IN THEIR POSSESSION CERTAIN INFORMATION PERTAINING

TO A COMPETITOR, LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION (LOCKHEED), UNDER THE EVOLVED EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE (EELV) PROGRAM. THE EMPLOYEES, ONE OF WHOM WAS A FORMER EMPLOYEE OF LOCKHEED, WERE TERMINATED AND A THIRD EMPLOYEE WAS DISCIPLINED AND

RESIGNED. IN MARCH 2003, THE USAF NOTIFIED US THAT IT WAS REVIEWING OUR PRESENT RESPONSIBILITY AS A GOVERNMENT CONTRACTOR IN CONNECTION WITH THE INCIDENT. ON JULY 24, 2003, THE USAF SUSPENDED CERTAIN ORGANIZATIONS IN OUR SPACE LAUNCH SERVICES

BUSINESS AND THE THREE FORMER EMPLOYEES FROM RECEIVING GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD AS A DIRECT RESULT OF ALLEGED WRONGDOING RELATING TO POSSESSION OF THE LOCKHEED INFORMATION DURING THE EELV SOURCE SELECTION IN 1998. THE USAF ALSO

TERMINATED 7 OUT OF 21 OF OUR EELV LAUNCHES PREVIOUSLY AWARDED THROUGH A MUTUAL CONTRACT MODIFICATION AND DISQUALIFIED THE LAUNCH SERVICES BUSINESS FROM COMPETING FOR THREE ADDITIONAL LAUNCHES UNDER A FOLLOW-ON PROCUREMENT. THE SAME INCIDENT IS

UNDER INVESTIGATION BY THE U.S. ATTORNEY IN LOS ANGELES, WHO INDICTED TWO OF THE FORMER EMPLOYEES IN JULY 2003. WE ARE IN DISCUSSIONS WITH THE USAF REGARDING A POSSIBLE ADMINISTRATIVE AGREEMENT THAT WOULD FACILITATE LIFTING OF THE SUSPENSION IN

ADVANCE OF FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION. IN ADDITION, IN JUNE 2003, LOCKHEED FILED A LAWSUIT IN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT FOR THE MIDDLE DISTRICT OF FLORIDA AGAINST US AND THE THREE INDIVIDUAL FORMER EMPLOYEES ARISING FROM

THE SAME FACTS. SUBSEQUENTLY, LOCKHEED FILED AN AMENDED COMPLAINT WHICH ADDED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION AND BOEING LAUNCH SERVICES AS DEFENDANTS. LOCKHEEDS CURRENT COMPLAINT, WHICH INCLUDES SOME 29 CAUSES OF ACTION, SEEKS INJUNCTIVE

RELIEF, COMPENSATORY DAMAGES IN EXCESS OF $2 BILLION AND TREBLE AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. IN AUGUST 2004, WE FILED COUNTERCLAIMS AGAINST LOCKHEED SEEKING COMPENSATORY AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. THE COUNTERCLAIMS ALLEGE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THAT LOCKHEED MADE

FALSE STATEMENTS TO THE U.S GOVERNMENT REGARDING THE REASONS FOR THE INITIAL ALLOCATION OF THE MAJORITY OF LAUNCHES TO US IN THE EELV PROCUREMENT. WE FURTHER ALLEGE THAT THESE FALSE STATEMENTS RESULTED IN THE CLAIMED DAMAGES. LOCKHEED HAS FILED A

MOTION TO DISMISS THE COUNTERCLAIMS, WHICH REMAINS PENDING BEFORE THE COURT. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE WHETHER AN ADVERSE OUTCOME WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS WERE FILED IN COOK COUNTY CIRCUIT COURT, ILLINOIS, AGAINST US AS NOMINAL DEFENDANT AND AGAINST EACH THEN CURRENT MEMBER OF OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS. THESE SUITS HAVE NOW BEEN CONSOLIDATED. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THE

DIRECTORS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES IN FAILING TO PUT IN PLACE ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROLS AND MEANS OF SUPERVISION TO PREVENT THE EELV INCIDENT DESCRIBED ABOVE, THE JULY 2003 CHARGE AGAINST EARNINGS, AND VARIOUS OTHER EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

CITED IN THE PRESS DURING 2003. THE LAWSUIT SEEKS AN UNSPECIFIED AMOUNT OF DAMAGES AGAINST EACH DIRECTOR, THE RETURN OF CERTAIN SALARIES AND OTHER REMUNERATIONS AND THE IMPLEMENTATION OF REMEDIAL MEASURES.

IN OCTOBER 2003, A THIRD SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE ACTION WAS FILED AGAINST THE SAME

DEFENDANTS IN FEDERAL COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK. THIS THIRD SUIT CHARGED THAT OUR 2003 PROXY STATEMENT CONTAINED FALSE AND MISLEADING STATEMENTS CONCERNING THE 2003 INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN. THE LAWSUIT SOUGHT A DECLARATION VOIDING

SHAREHOLDER APPROVAL OF THE 2003 INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND EQUITABLE ACCOUNTING. THIS CASE WAS DISMISSED BY THE COURT AND THE PLAINTIFF HAS APPEALED TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE SECOND CIRCUIT.

IT IS NOT POSSIBLE AT THIS TIME TO DETERMINE WHETHER THESE SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE

ACTIONS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) INQUIRY

ON NOVEMBER 24, 2003, OUR EXECUTIVE VICE PRESIDENT AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, MIKE SEARS, WAS DISMISSED FOR CAUSE AS THE RESULT OF CIRCUMSTANCES SURROUNDING

THE HIRING OF DARLEEN DRUYUN, A FORMER U.S. GOVERNMENT OFFICIAL. DRUYUN, WHO HAD BEEN VICE PRESIDENT AND DEPUTY GENERAL MANAGER OF MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS SINCE JANUARY 2003, ALSO WAS DISMISSED FOR CAUSE. AT THE TIME OF OUR NOVEMBER 24 ANNOUNCEMENT

THAT WE HAD DISMISSED THE TWO EXECUTIVES FOR UNETHICAL CONDUCT, WE ALSO ADVISED THAT

115

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE HAD INFORMED THE USAF OF THE ACTIONS TAKEN AND WERE COOPERATING WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN ITS ONGOING INVESTIGATION. THE INVESTIGATION IS BEING CONDUCTED BY THE

U.S. ATTORNEY IN ALEXANDRIA, VIRGINIA, AND THE DOD INSPECTOR GENERAL CONCERNING THIS AND RELATED MATTERS. SUBSEQUENTLY, THE SEC REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM US REGARDING THE CIRCUMSTANCES UNDERLYING DISMISSAL OF THE TWO EMPLOYEES. WE ARE COOPERATING

WITH THE SECS INQUIRY. IN 2004, DRUYUN AND SEARS EACH PLEADED GUILTY TO A SINGLE CONFLICT-OF-INTEREST-RELATED CRIMINAL CHARGE ARISING FROM DRUYUN HAVING ENGAGED IN EMPLOYMENT DISCUSSIONS WITH SEARS MORE THAN TWO WEEKS PRIOR TO DISQUALIFYING

HERSELF FROM PARTICIPATING IN USAF BUSINESS INVOLVING US. AT HER SENTENCING, DRUYUN AND THE GOVERNMENT ASSERTED THAT SHE GAVE US FAVORABLE TREATMENT ON THE USAF 767 TANKER NEGOTIATIONS, NATO AWACS CLAIM, C-130 AMP CONTRACT AWARD, AND C-17

NEGOTIATIONS IN 2000, AND THAT THIS TREATMENT WAS INFLUENCED BY EMPLOYMENT NEGOTIATIONS AND RELATIONSHIPS WITH US. THE GOVERNMENT ACCOUNTABILITY OFFICE HAS SUBSEQUENTLY RECOMMENDED THAT THE U.S. AIR FORCE COMPETE ADDITIONAL SMALL DIAMETER BOMB WORK

AND THE INSTALLATION PORTION OF THE C-130 AMP CONTRACT AND ANALYZE WHETHER THE C-130 AMP CONTRACT SHOULD BE RECOMPETED. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE AT THIS TIME WHAT FURTHER ACTIONS THE GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES MIGHT TAKE WITH RESPECT TO THIS

MATTER, OR WHETHER THOSE ACTIONS WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

ON OCTOBER 13, 2004, THE SEC REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM US IN CONNECTION WITH AN INQUIRY CONCERNING ACCOUNTING ISSUES INVOLVING PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS AT SEVERAL COMPANIES. WE ARE

COOPERATING WITH THE SECS INQUIRY. ALTHOUGH AN SEC SPOKESMAN HAS PUBLICLY STATED THAT THE AGENCY HAS NO EVIDENCE OF WRONGDOING, WE CANNOT PREDICT WHAT ACTIONS, IF ANY, THE SEC MIGHT TAKE WITH RESPECT TO THIS MATTER AND WHETHER THOSE ACTIONS

WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION LITIGATION

WE ARE A DEFENDANT IN NINE EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION MATTERS FILED DURING THE PERIOD OF JUNE 1998 THROUGH JANUARY 2005, IN WHICH CLASS CERTIFICATION IS SOUGHT OR HAS BEEN GRANTED. THREE MATTERS

WERE FILED IN THE FEDERAL COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON IN SEATTLE; ONE CASE WAS FILED IN THE FEDERAL COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA IN LOS ANGELES; ONE CASE WAS FILED IN STATE COURT IN CALIFORNIA; ONE CASE WAS FILED IN

THE FEDERAL COURT IN ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI; ONE CASE WAS FILED IN THE FEDERAL COURT IN TULSA, OKLAHOMA; ONE CASE WAS FILED IN THE FEDERAL COURT IN WICHITA, KANSAS, AND THE FINAL CASE WAS FILED IN THE FEDERAL COURT IN CHICAGO. THE LAWSUITS SEEK VARIOUS

FORMS OF RELIEF INCLUDING FRONT AND BACK PAY, OVERTIME, INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AND PUNITIVE DAMAGES. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE OUR AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE OF THESE CASES.

THE LAWSUITS ARE IN VARYING STAGES OF LITIGATION. ONE CASE IN SEATTLE ALLEGING DISCRIMINATION BASED ON NATIONAL ORIGIN (ASIAN) RESULTED IN A VERDICT FOR THE COMPANY

FOLLOWING TRIAL AND IS NOW ON APPEAL. ONE CASE IN SEATTLE ALLEGING DISCRIMINATION BASED ON GENDER HAS BEEN SETTLED. THREE CASES  ONE IN LOS ANGELES, ONE IN MISSOURI, AND ONE IN KANSAS, ALL ALLEGING GENDER DISCRIMINATION  HAVE RESULTED IN

DENIALS OF CLASS CERTIFICATION; EACH OF THOSE DECISIONS IS BEING CHALLENGED. THE CASE IN OKLAHOMA, ALSO ALLEGING GENDER DISCRIMINATION, RESULTED IN THE GRANTING OF CLASS ACTION STATUS, AND IS SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN AUGUST 2005. THE SECOND CASE

ALLEGING DISCRIMINATION BASED ON GENDER IN CALIFORNIA, THIS ONE IN STATE COURT, HAS BEEN STAYED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE APPEAL OF THE DENIAL OF CLASS CERTIFICATION IN THE COMPANION FEDERAL COURT CASE IN LOS ANGELES. THE COURT CERTIFIED A LIMITED

CLASS IN THE RACE DISCRIMINATION CASE (AFRICAN-AMERICAN) FILED IN FEDERAL COURT IN SEATTLE (CONSISTING OF HERITAGE BOEING SALARIED EMPLOYEES ONLY) AND SET A DECEMBER 2005 TRIAL DATE. THE FINAL CASE, ALSO ALLEGING RACE DISCRIMINATION

(AFRICAN-AMERICAN) AND FILED IN CHICAGO, SEEKS A CLASS OF ALL INDIVIDUALS EXCLUDED FROM THE LIMITED CLASS IN THE SEATTLE CASE.

BSSI/ICO LITIGATION

ON AUGUST 16, 2004, IN RESPONSE TO A DRAFT DEMAND FOR ARBITRATION FROM ICO GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS (OPERATIONS), LTD. (ICO)

SEEKING RETURN OF MONIES PAID BY ICO TO BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. (BSSI) UNDER CONTRACTS FOR MANUFACTURE AND LAUNCH OF COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES, BSSI FILED A COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AGAINST ICO IN LOS ANGELES

COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT. BSSIS SUIT SEEKS A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT ICOS PRIOR TERMINATION OF THE

116

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTRACTS FOR CONVENIENCE EXTINGUISHED ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. ICO FILED A CROSS COMPLAINT WITH THE COURT ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2004, ALLEGING BREACH OF CONTRACT,

AND OTHER CLAIMS, AND SEEKING RECOVERY OF ALL AMOUNTS IT INVESTED IN THE CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE ALLEGED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $2 BILLION. WE BELIEVE THAT ICOS CLAIMS LACK MERIT AND INTEND TO AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE OUR SUIT AGAINST ICO FOR DECLARATORY

RELIEF AND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND AGAINST ICOS CROSS-COMPLAINT.

IT

IS NOT POSSIBLE TO DETERMINE WHETHER ANY OF THE ACTIONS DISCUSSED WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THOSE FOR DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES DISCUSSED. SUCH REQUIREMENTS

HAVE RESULTED IN OUR BEING INVOLVED IN LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS SINCE THE 1980S.

WE ROUTINELY ASSESS, BASED ON IN-DEPTH STUDIES, EXPERT ANALYSES AND LEGAL REVIEWS, OUR CONTINGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RANGES AND

PROBABILITIES OF RECOVERIES FROM OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO HAVE AND HAVE NOT AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT AND OF RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS. OUR POLICY IS TO IMMEDIATELY ACCRUE AND CHARGE TO CURRENT EXPENSE IDENTIFIED EXPOSURES RELATED TO

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SITES BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE WITHIN A RANGE OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURE FOR INVESTIGATION, CLEANUP AND MONITORING COSTS TO BE INCURRED.

THE COSTS INCURRED AND EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT HAD, AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON US.

WITH RESPECT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, RELATED CHARGES HAVE AVERAGED LESS THAN 1% OF HISTORICAL ANNUAL REVENUES. ALTHOUGH NOT CONSIDERED LIKELY, SHOULD WE BE REQUIRED TO INCUR REMEDIATION CHARGES AT THE HIGH LEVEL OF THE RANGE OF POTENTIAL EXPOSURE,

THE ADDITIONAL CHARGES WOULD BE LESS THAN 3% OF HISTORICAL ANNUAL REVENUES.

BECAUSE OF THE REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES AND RISK OF UNIDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED SITES AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTIMATED COSTS ACCRUED FOR IDENTIFIED

CONTAMINATED SITES. HOWEVER, BASED ON ALL KNOWN FACTS AND EXPERT ANALYSES, WE BELIEVE IT IS NOT REASONABLY LIKELY THAT IDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL

POSITION OR TO OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOW TRENDS.

WE HAVE

POSSIBLE MATERIAL EXPOSURES RELATED TO THE 747 PROGRAM, PRINCIPALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO TERMINATION COSTS THAT COULD RESULT FROM A LACK OF MARKET DEMAND. WE ARE CONTINUING TO MONITOR THE COMMERCIAL MARKET FOR THE 747 AND POTENTIAL NEW DERIVATIVES. DUE

TO UNCERTAINTY OF THE MARKET ACCEPTANCE, TERMINATION OF PRODUCTION IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE. A FORWARD LOSS IS NOT EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF A DECISION TO COMPLETE PRODUCTION BUT PROGRAM MARGINS WOULD BE MODESTLY IMPACTED. ADDITIONALLY, COMPLETION OF

PRODUCTION MAY CREATE EXCESS SPARE INVENTORY, RESULTING IN A CHARGE THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL. A DECISION TO PROCEED WITH NEW DERIVATIVES OR COMPLETE PRODUCTION IS LIKELY TO BE MADE MID-YEAR 2005.

ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE POSSIBLE MATERIAL EXPOSURES RELATED TO THE 767 PROGRAM, ALSO

ATTRIBUTABLE TO TERMINATION COSTS THAT COULD RESULT FROM A LACK OF MARKET DEMAND. THE LONG-TERM VIABILITY OF THE 767 PROGRAM IS DEPENDENT ON RECEIVING A TIMELY USAF TANKER CONTRACT. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY, PRODUCTION COMPLETION IS REASONABLY

POSSIBLE. A FORWARD LOSS IS NOT EXPECTED AS A RESULT OF THIS DECISION BUT PROGRAM MARGINS WOULD BE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED. ADDITIONALLY, COMPLETION OF PRODUCTION MAY CREATE EXCESS SPARES INVENTORY, RESULTING IN A CHARGE THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE

MATERIAL. WE CONTINUE TO ACTIVELY MARKET THE 767 PROGRAM TO COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AND POSITION THE PROGRAM TO SUPPORT A USAF

117

TABLE OF CONTENTS

767 TANKER CONTRACT AND OTHER MILITARY APPLICATIONS. A DECISION TO COMPLETE PRODUCTION IS LIKELY TO BE MADE MID-YEAR 2005.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND SURETY BONDS WITH

FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS PRIMARILY RELATING TO THE GUARANTEE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE ON CERTAIN CONTRACTS. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ON OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND SURETY BONDS AGGREGATED APPROXIMATELY $3,183 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND

APPROXIMATELY $2,364 AT DECEMBER 31, 2003.

FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES,

WE RECORD COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT REVENUES AND COST OF SALES FOR AIRPLANES TRANSFERRED TO OTHER SEGMENTS. SUCH TRANSFERS MAY INCLUDE AIRPLANES ACCOUNTED FOR AS OPERATING LEASES AND CONSIDERED TRANSFERRED TO THE BCC SEGMENT AND AIRPLANES

TRANSFERRED TO THE IDS SEGMENT FOR FURTHER MODIFICATION PRIOR TO DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER. THE REVENUES AND COST OF SALES FOR THESE TRANSFERS ARE ELIMINATED IN THE ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS CAPTION. IN THE EVENT AN AIRPLANE

ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN OPERATING LEASE IS SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD, THE ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS CAPTION WOULD REFLECT THE RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND COST OF SALES ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES, WE RECORD IDS REVENUES AND COST OF SALES FOR ONLY THE

MODIFICATION PERFORMED ON AIRPLANES RECEIVED FROM COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES WHEN THE AIRPLANE IS DELIVERED TO THE CUSTOMER OR AT THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE MILESTONES. THE ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS CAPTION WOULD REFLECT THE

RECOGNITION OF REVENUES AND COST OF SALES FOR THE PRE-MODIFIED AIRPLANE UPON DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER OR AT THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE MILESTONES.

SFAS NO. 131,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT SEGMENTS OF AN ENTERPRISE AND RELATED INFORMATION

, REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF OPERATING SEGMENT DATA ON A BASIS THAT IS USED BY

MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES. IF MANAGEMENT USES A NON-GAAP MEASURE OF SEGMENT PROFIT OR LOSS AND ASSETS TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES, THAT NON-GAAP MEASUREMENT BASIS IS TO BE USED FOR EXTERNAL SEGMENT

REPORTING. IF MORE THAN ONE BASIS OF MEASUREMENT IS USED BY MANAGEMENT, THEN THE BASIS THAT IS MOST CONSISTENT WITH THAT USED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IS TO BE USED FOR EXTERNAL SEGMENT REPORTING.

120

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BEGINNING IN 2003, THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT IS BEING REPORTED UNDER THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. PRIOR

TO 2003, SEGMENT DATA WAS PRESENTED USING THE NON-GAAP UNIT ACCOUNTING BASIS OF MEASUREMENT USED BY OUR MANAGEMENT TO EVALUATE PERFORMANCE AND ALLOCATE RESOURCES FOR THE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT SEGMENT. HOWEVER, DURING 2002, OUR MANAGEMENT BEGAN THE

TRANSITION TO USING BOTH GAAP PROGRAM ACCOUNTING AND NON-GAAP UNIT ACCOUNTING FOR INTERNAL COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT SEGMENT REPORTING. THIS TRANSITION WAS COMPLETED IN THE BEGINNING OF 2003, AT WHICH TIME WE BEGAN USING GAAP PROGRAM ACCOUNTING, WHICH IS

THE BASIS OF ACCOUNTING USED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FOR EXTERNAL COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT SEGMENT REPORTING. THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT NUMBERS FOR THE PERIODS ENDING DECEMBER 31, 2004, 2003 AND 2002, HAVE BEEN REVISED TO REFLECT

THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING.

THE ACCOUNTING

DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS CAPTION OF NET EARNINGS INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF COST MEASUREMENT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GAAP AND FEDERAL COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. THIS INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING: THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PENSION COSTS RECOGNIZED UNDER SFAS

NO. 87,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS

, AND UNDER FEDERAL COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, PRINCIPALLY ON A FUNDING BASIS; THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN RETIREE HEALTH CARE COSTS RECOGNIZED UNDER SFAS NO. 106,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

, AND UNDER FEDERAL COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, PRINCIPALLY ON A CASH BASIS, THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN WORKERS COMPENSATION COSTS RECOGNIZED UNDER SFAS NO. 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES

, AND

UNDER FEDERAL COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, UNDER WHICH ADJUSTMENTS TO PRIOR YEARS ESTIMATES OF CLAIMS INCURRED AND NOT REPORTED ARE RECOGNIZED IN FUTURE PERIODS; AND THE DIFFERENCES IN TIMING OF COST RECOGNITION RELATED TO CERTAIN ACTIVITIES,

SUCH AS FACILITIES CONSOLIDATION, UNDERTAKEN AS A RESULT OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS WHEREBY SUCH COSTS ARE EXPENSED UNDER GAAP AND DEFERRED UNDER FEDERAL COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. ADDITIONALLY, THE AMORTIZATION OF COSTS CAPITALIZED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH SFAS NO. 34,

CAPITALIZATION OF INTEREST COST

, IS INCLUDED IN THE ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS CAPTION. THE TABLE BELOW SUMMARIZES THE ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS LINE IN NET EARNINGS.

BCCS PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2004 AND 2003, TOTALED $9,680 AND $10,118. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN BCCS TOTAL ASSETS AND PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY CASH AND ASSETS

OF DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS.

124

TABLE OF CONTENTS

AS PART OF BCCS QUARTERLY REVIEW OF ITS PORTFOLIO OF FINANCING ASSETS AND OPERATING LEASES, ADJUSTMENTS TO

THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE AND SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT LOSSES WERE IDENTIFIED. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, BCC RECORDED A RECOVERY TO THE PROVISION FOR LOSSES OF $38. THIS INCLUDED A SPECIAL REDUCTION OF $55 OFFSET BY A NORMAL PROVISION FOR

LOSSES OF $17. THE PRIMARY FACTORS ATTRIBUTING TO THE $55 REDUCTION IN THE PROVISION FOR LOSSES IN 2004 WERE: $53 OF BENEFIT FROM THE MITIGATION OF COLLATERAL EXPOSURE FROM AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS; $28 OF NET BENEFIT DUE TO REFINEMENTS IN

THE METHODOLOGY FOR MEASURING COLLATERAL VALUES; $11 OF NET BENEFIT DUE TO THE SALE OF VARIOUS NOTES THUS DECREASING COLLATERAL EXPOSURE; AND A $49 INCREASE IN THE REQUIREMENT IN THE ALLOWANCE ACCOUNT RESULTING FROM THE DETERMINATION THAT

RECEIVABLES FROM ATA WERE SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT. HOWEVER, DURING THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003 AND 2002, BCC INCREASED THE PROVISION FOR LOSSES BY $151 AND $108, PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM DETERIORATED AIRLINE CREDIT RATINGS AND

DEPRESSED AIRCRAFT VALUES BASED ON OUR QUARTERLY ASSESSMENT OF THE ADEQUACY OF CUSTOMER FINANCING RESERVES.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004, BCC RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $106. THIS WAS COMPRISED OF $47 FOR AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT OF AN INVESTMENT IN ATA MATURING IN 2015, $32 RELATED TO

THE IMPAIRMENT OF BCCS INVESTMENT IN AN EETC WHICH FINANCES AIRCRAFT WITH DELTA, $16 OF SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED PRIMARILY TO AIRCRAFT TRADING AND $11 OF VALUATION LOSS ON ONE BBJ RECLASSIFIED FROM DISCONTINUED OPERATIONS TO

CONTINUING OPERATIONS AS A RESULT OF OUR DECISION TO RETAIN THE AIRCRAFT. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2003, BCC RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $100 AND CHARGES OF $21 RELATED TO THE WRITE-OFF OF FORWARD-STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS RELATED

TO HAWAIIAN. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, BCC RECOGNIZED IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $13 DUE TO IMPAIRMENTS OF INVESTMENTS IN ETCS, CHARGES OF $48 DUE TO IMPAIRMENTS OF JOINT VENTURE AIRCRAFT AND CHARGES OF $32 RELATED TO VALUATION OF OTHER

ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO.

INTRACOMPANY GUARANTEES

WE PROVIDE BCC WITH CERTAIN INTRACOMPANY GUARANTEES AND OTHER SUBSIDIES. INTRACOMPANY

GUARANTEES PRIMARILY RELATE TO RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES AND CREDIT GUARANTEES (FIRST LOSS DEFICIENCY GUARANTEES AND RENTAL GUARANTEES). RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES PROVIDE BCC A SPECIFIED ASSET VALUE AT THE END OF A LEASE AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD-PARTY

IN THE EVENT OF A DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE OF THE FINANCED AIRCRAFT. FIRST LOSS DEFICIENCY GUARANTEES COVER A SPECIFIED PORTION OF BCCS LOSSES ON FINANCED AIRCRAFT IN THE EVENT OF A LOSS UPON DISPOSITION OF THE AIRCRAFT FOLLOWING A DEFAULT BY

THE THIRD-PARTY LESSEE. RENTAL LOSS GUARANTEES ARE WHOLE OR PARTIAL GUARANTEES COVERING BCC AGAINST THE THIRD-PARTY LESSEES FAILURE TO PAY RENT UNDER THE LEASE AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION TO GUARANTEES, OTHER SUBSIDIES ARE ALSO PROVIDED TO BCC

MAINLY IN THE FORM OF RENTAL PAYMENTS ON RESTRUCTURED THIRD-PARTY LEASES AND INTEREST RATE SUBSIDIES.

AS A RESULT OF GUARANTEED RESIDUAL VALUES OF ASSETS OR GUARANTEED INCOME STREAMS UNDER CREDIT GUARANTEES, BCC IS ABATED FROM ASSET IMPAIRMENTS ON THE GUARANTEED AIRCRAFT TO THE EXTENT OF GUARANTEE

COVERAGE. IF AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT IS CALCULATED ON A GUARANTEED AIRCRAFT, THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS GENERALLY RECORDED IN THE OTHER SEGMENT. IF THE GUARANTEE AMOUNT IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE FULL IMPAIRMENT LOSS, THE SHORTAGE IS RECORDED BY BCC.

DUE TO INTRACOMPANY GUARANTEES, THE BCC ACCOUNTING CLASSIFICATION OF

CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY LEASES MAY DIFFER FROM THE ACCOUNTING CLASSIFICATION IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (I.E. DIRECT FINANCING LEASE AT BCC, OPERATING LEASE IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; OR LEVERAGED LEASE AT BCC, SALES-TYPE

LEASE IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). IN THESE CASES, THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AT BCC IS ELIMINATED AND THE IMPACT OF THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTING TREATMENT IS RECORDED IN THE OTHER SEGMENT.

AND 2002, THERE WERE ADDITIONAL ASSET IMPAIRMENTS AND OTHER CHARGES OF $2, $5 AND $146, RELATED TO THE DETERIORATION OF AIRCRAFT VALUES, REDUCED ESTIMATED CASH FLOWS FOR OPERATING LEASES AND THE RENEGOTIATION OF LEASES.

NOTE 26  STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS

WORKING CAPITAL INCLUDES CUSTOMER FINANCING TRANSACTIONS PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF

NOTES RECEIVABLES, SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES AND OPERATING LEASES. THESE TRANSACTIONS GENERALLY OCCUR AS THE RESULT OF CUSTOMER FINANCING-RELATED ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH ITEMS RECORDED IN INVENTORY. THE ORIGINATION AND SUBSEQUENT PRINCIPAL

COLLECTIONS FOR THESE TRANSACTIONS WERE PREVIOUSLY PRESENTED AS INVESTING ACTIVITIES IN OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. CUSTOMER FINANCING TRANSACTIONS BY COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES WERE PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED AS NON-CASH AND EXCLUDED FROM THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS. (SEE NOTE 8.) WE RECEIVED NO CASH FROM THESE CUSTOMER FINANCING TRANSACTIONS ON A CONSOLIDATED BASIS. WE CHANGED THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE CASH FLOW EFFECTS OF CUSTOMER FINANCING TRANSACTIONS STEMMING FROM

CONCERNS RAISED BY THE STAFF OF THE SEC. THESE TRANSACTIONS ARE CURRENTLY PRESENTED AS OPERATING ACTIVITIES. THE AMOUNTS FOR PRIOR PERIODS HAVE BEEN RECLASSIFIED TO BE CONSISTENT WITH CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004,

2003 AND 2002, THE NET IMPACT ON OPERATING CASH FLOW IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS WAS ($421), ($1,316), AND ($2,038), RESPECTIVELY, FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING TRANSACTIONS. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AMOUNTS ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS AND BCCS CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS PRIMARILY RELATES TO OPERATING LEASE ACTIVITY AT THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT.

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF

THE BOEING COMPANY

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

WE HAVE AUDITED MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, THAT THE BOEING

COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF

SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT AND AN OPINION ON THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY

ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR

AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, EVALUATING MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES

AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINIONS.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND

PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE

PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE

MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, MANAGEMENTS ASSESSMENT THAT THE COMPANY

MAINTAINED EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, IS FAIRLY STATED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. ALSO IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2004, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN INTERNAL

CONTROLINTEGRATED FRAMEWORK ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS, SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, AND CASH FLOWS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2004 OF THE COMPANY AND OUR REPORT DATED FEBRUARY 25, 2005 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND

FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE.
