FINANCIAL AND OTHER BUSINESS INFORMATION

SEE PAGE 55 FOR THE SUMMARY OF BUSINESS SEGMENT DATA AND NOTE 21 TO

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR FINANCIAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING REVENUES AND EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS, FOR EACH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

WE OWN NUMEROUS PATENTS AND HAVE

LICENSES FOR THE USE OF PATENTS OWNED BY OTHERS, WHICH RELATE TO OUR PRODUCTS AND THEIR MANUFACTURE. IN ADDITION TO OWNING A LARGE PORTFOLIO OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, WE ALSO LICENSE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TO AND FROM THIRD PARTIES. FOR EXAMPLE, THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT HAS LICENSES IN OUR PATENTS THAT ARE DEVELOPED IN PERFORMANCE OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, AND IT MAY USE OR AUTHORIZE OTHERS TO USE THE INVENTIONS COVERED BY SUCH PATENTS FOR GOVERNMENT PURPOSES. UNPATENTED

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT AND ENGINEERING SKILLS, AS WELL AS CERTAIN TRADEMARKS AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, ALSO MAKE AN IMPORTANT CONTRIBUTION TO OUR BUSINESS. WHILE OUR INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS IN THE AGGREGATE ARE IMPORTANT TO THE OPERATION OF EACH OF OUR BUSINESSES, WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT OUR BUSINESS WOULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY THE EXPIRATION OF ANY PARTICULAR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHT OR TERMINATION OF ANY

PARTICULAR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY PATENT LICENSE AGREEMENT.

NON-U.S. REVENUES

SEE NOTE 21 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR INFORMATION REGARDING NON-U.S. REVENUES.

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES INVOLVE EXPERIMENTATION, DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED TEST ACTIVITIES FOR DEFENSE SYSTEMS, NEW

AND DERIVATIVE JET AIRCRAFT INCLUDING BOTH COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY, ADVANCED SPACE AND OTHER COMPANY-SPONSORED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. THESE ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED INCLUDING AMOUNTS ALLOCABLE AS REIMBURSABLE OVERHEAD COSTS ON U.S. GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS.

OUR TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AMOUNTED TO $4.1 BILLION, $6.5 BILLION AND $3.8 BILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE

2008 AMOUNT IS NET OF 787-RELATED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COST SHARING PAYMENTS FROM SUPPLIERS OF $50 MILLION. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN 2009 INCLUDED $2.7 BILLION OF PRODUCTION COSTS RELATED TO THE FIRST THREE FLIGHT TEST 787 AIRCRAFT

THAT CANNOT BE SOLD DUE TO THE INORDINATE AMOUNT OF REWORK AND UNIQUE AND EXTENSIVE MODIFICATIONS THAT WOULD BE MADE TO THE AIRCRAFT.

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT COSTS ALSO INCLUDE BID AND PROPOSAL EFFORTS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AS WELL AS COSTS INCURRED IN EXCESS OF AMOUNTS ESTIMATED TO BE RECOVERABLE UNDER COST-SHARING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS. BID AND PROPOSAL

COSTS WERE $355 MILLION, $343 MILLION AND $330 MILLION IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS FOR EACH OF THE MAJOR

BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE DISCUSSED IN MORE DETAIL IN SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION ON PAGES 22  38.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMPETITION

THE COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT MARKET AND THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REMAIN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE FACE AGGRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS WHO ARE INTENT ON INCREASING

THEIR MARKET SHARE, SUCH AS AIRBUS, EMBRAER AND BOMBARDIER, AND OTHER ENTRANTS FROM RUSSIA, CHINA AND JAPAN. WE ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OUR PROCESSES AND CONTINUING COST REDUCTION EFFORTS. WE INTEND TO CONTINUE TO COMPETE WITH OTHER AIRPLANE

MANUFACTURERS BY PROVIDING CUSTOMERS WITH GREATER VALUE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SUPPORT. WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE OUR EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES NETWORK WHICH INCLUDES AVIATION SUPPORT, SPARES, TRAINING, MAINTENANCE DOCUMENTS AND TECHNICAL

ADVICE FOR AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO PROVIDE A HIGHER LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND PRODUCTIVITY.

BDS FACES STRONG COMPETITION IN ALL

MARKET SEGMENTS, PRIMARILY FROM LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION, NORTHROP GRUMMAN CORPORATION, RAYTHEON COMPANY AND GENERAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION. NON-U.S. COMPANIES SUCH AS BAE SYSTEMS AND EUROPEAN AERONAUTIC DEFENCE AND SPACE COMPANY (EADS), THE PARENT

OF AIRBUS, CONTINUE TO BUILD A STRATEGIC PRESENCE IN THE U.S. MARKET BY STRENGTHENING THEIR NORTH AMERICAN OPERATIONS AND PARTNERING WITH U.S. DEFENSE COMPANIES. IN ADDITION, CERTAIN OF OUR COMPETITORS HAVE OCCASIONALLY FORMED TEAMS WITH OTHER

COMPETITORS TO ADDRESS SPECIFIC CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. BDS EXPECTS THE TREND OF STRONG COMPETITION TO CONTINUE INTO 2011 WITH MANY INTERNATIONAL FIRMS PURSUING ANNOUNCED INTENTIONS OF INCREASING THEIR U.S. PRESENCE.

REGULATORY MATTERS

OUR BUSINESSES ARE HEAVILY REGULATED IN

MOST OF OUR MARKETS. WE DEAL WITH NUMEROUS U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND ENTITIES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO ALL OF THE BRANCHES OF THE U.S. MILITARY, NASA AND THE DEPARTMENT OF HOMELAND SECURITY. SIMILAR GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES EXIST IN OUR

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, AND OTHER GOVERNMENTS, MAY TERMINATE ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AT

THEIR CONVENIENCE, AS WELL AS FOR DEFAULT, BASED ON OUR FAILURE TO MEET SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE MEASUREMENTS. IF ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WERE TO BE TERMINATED FOR CONVENIENCE, WE GENERALLY WOULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PAYMENT FOR WORK

COMPLETED AND ALLOWABLE TERMINATION OR CANCELLATION COSTS. IF ANY OF OUR GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS WERE TO BE TERMINATED FOR DEFAULT, GENERALLY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD PAY ONLY FOR THE WORK THAT HAS BEEN ACCEPTED AND CAN REQUIRE US TO PAY THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT PRICE AND THE COST TO RE-PROCURE THE CONTRACT ITEMS, NET OF THE WORK ACCEPTED FROM THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CAN ALSO HOLD US LIABLE FOR DAMAGES RESULTING FROM THE DEFAULT.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.

IN THE UNITED STATES, OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTS ARE REQUIRED TO COMPLY WITH FEDERAL AVIATION ADMINISTRATION REGULATIONS

GOVERNING PRODUCTION AND QUALITY SYSTEMS, AIRWORTHINESS AND INSTALLATION APPROVALS, REPAIR PROCEDURES AND CONTINUING OPERATIONAL SAFETY. INTERNATIONALLY, SIMILAR REQUIREMENTS EXIST FOR AIRWORTHINESS, INSTALLATION AND OPERATIONAL APPROVALS. THESE

REQUIREMENTS ARE GENERALLY ADMINISTERED BY THE NATIONAL AVIATION AUTHORITIES OF EACH COUNTRY AND, IN THE CASE OF EUROPE, COORDINATED BY THE EUROPEAN JOINT AVIATION AUTHORITIES.

ENVIRONMENTAL.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE, TREATMENT, STORAGE, DISPOSAL AND REMEDIATION OF

HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND WASTES. WE CONTINUALLY ASSESS OUR COMPLIANCE STATUS AND MANAGEMENT OF ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS TO ENSURE OUR OPERATIONS ARE IN SUBSTANTIAL COMPLIANCE WITH ALL APPLICABLE ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS. OPERATING AND

MAINTENANCE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE AND MANAGEMENT OF SITES ARE A NORMAL, RECURRING PART OF OUR OPERATIONS. THESE COSTS OFTEN ARE ALLOWABLE COSTS UNDER OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT

CONTINUED ENVIRONMENTAL COMPLIANCE COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL CONDITION OR CASH FLOWS IF MORE STRINGENT CLEAN-UP STANDARDS ARE IMPOSED, ADDITIONAL CONTAMINATION IS DISCOVERED AND/OR CLEAN-UP COSTS ARE HIGHER

THAN ESTIMATED.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

A POTENTIALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY (PRP) HAS JOINT AND SEVERAL LIABILITY UNDER EXISTING U.S. ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS. WHERE

WE HAVE BEEN DESIGNATED A PRP BY THE ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY OR A STATE ENVIRONMENTAL AGENCY, WE ARE POTENTIALLY LIABLE TO THE GOVERNMENT OR THIRD PARTIES FOR THE FULL COST OF REMEDIATING CONTAMINATION AT OUR FACILITIES OR FORMER FACILITIES

OR AT THIRD-PARTY SITES. IF WE WERE REQUIRED TO FULLY FUND THE REMEDIATION OF A SITE, THE STATUTORY FRAMEWORK WOULD ALLOW US TO PURSUE RIGHTS TO CONTRIBUTION FROM OTHER PRPS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES, SEE

NOTE 11 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INTERNATIONAL.

OUR INTERNATIONAL SALES ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENTAL

REGULATIONS AND PROCUREMENT POLICIES AND PRACTICES, INCLUDING REGULATIONS RELATING TO IMPORT-EXPORT CONTROL, INVESTMENT, EXCHANGE CONTROLS AND REPATRIATION OF EARNINGS. INTERNATIONAL SALES ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO VARYING CURRENCY, POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC

RISKS.

RAW MATERIALS

WE ARE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON

THE AVAILABILITY OF ESSENTIAL MATERIALS, PARTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES FROM OUR SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS. THE MOST IMPORTANT RAW MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR OUR AEROSPACE PRODUCTS ARE ALUMINUM (SHEET, PLATE, FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS), TITANIUM (SHEET,

PLATE, FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS) AND COMPOSITES (INCLUDING CARBON AND BORON). ALTHOUGH ALTERNATIVE SOURCES GENERALLY EXIST FOR THESE RAW MATERIALS, QUALIFICATION OF THE SOURCES COULD TAKE ONE YEAR OR MORE. MANY MAJOR COMPONENTS AND PRODUCT EQUIPMENT

ITEMS ARE PROCURED OR SUBCONTRACTED ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS WITH A NUMBER OF COMPANIES.

SUPPLIERS

WE ARE DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY OF A LARGE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO MEET PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS, QUALITY STANDARDS AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES AT

ANTICIPATED COSTS. WHILE WE MAINTAIN AN EXTENSIVE QUALIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO CONTROL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES, FAILURE OF SUPPLIERS OR SUBCONTRACTORS TO MEET COMMITMENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AND PROGRAM/CONTRACT PROFITABILITY, THEREBY JEOPARDIZING OUR ABILITY TO FULFILL COMMITMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ARE ALSO DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY SOURCES, SUCH AS ELECTRICITY, AT AFFORDABLE PRICES. A NUMBER OF

OUR SUPPLIERS HAVE MADE ASSERTIONS FOR HIGHER PRICES OR OTHER CONTRACTUAL COMPENSATION RELIEF WHICH COULD AFFECT PROGRAM/CONTRACT PROFITABILITY.

SEASONALITY

NO MATERIAL PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS IS

CONSIDERED TO BE SEASONAL.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS

THIS REPORT, AS WELL AS OUR ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS, QUARTERLY REPORTS, AND OTHER FILINGS WE MAKE WITH THE SEC, PRESS RELEASES AND OTHER WRITTEN AND ORAL COMMUNICATIONS, CONTAINS FORWARD-LOOKING

STATEMENTS WITHIN THE MEANING OF THE PRIVATE SECURITIES LITIGATION REFORM ACT OF 1995. WORDS SUCH AS MAY, WILL, SHOULD, EXPECTS, INTENDS, PROJECTS, BELIEVES,

ESTIMATES, TARGETS, ANTICIPATES AND SIMILAR EXPRESSIONS ARE USED TO IDENTIFY THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS INCLUDE ANY STATEMENT THAT DOES NOT DIRECTLY RELATE TO ANY HISTORICAL OR

CURRENT FACT.

FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS ARE BASED ON OUR CURRENT EXPECTATIONS AND ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH MAY NOT PROVE TO BE ACCURATE. THESE STATEMENTS

ARE NOT GUARANTEES AND ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS, UNCERTAINTIES AND CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT. MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING THOSE SET FORTH IN THE RISK FACTORS SECTION BELOW, COULD CAUSE ACTUAL RESULTS TO DIFFER

MATERIALLY AND ADVERSELY FROM THESE FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS. ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT SPEAKS ONLY AS OF THE DATE ON WHICH IT IS MADE, AND WE ASSUME NO OBLIGATION TO PUBLICLY UPDATE ANY FORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENT, EXCEPT AS REQUIRED BY LAW.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK OR DEBT SECURITIES INVOLVES RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND OUR ACTUAL RESULTS AND FUTURE TRENDS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR PAST OR PROJECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE. WE URGE INVESTORS

TO CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED BELOW IN EVALUATING THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT.

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT BUSINESS

DEPENDS HEAVILY ON COMMERCIAL AIRLINES AND OUR SUPPLIERS, AND IS SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS.

OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER AIRCRAFT ON TIME DEPENDS ON

A VARIETY OF FACTORS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS.

OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER AIRCRAFT ON SCHEDULE IS DEPENDENT UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXECUTION OF INTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS, AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS (SUCH AS ALUMINUM,

TITANIUM AND COMPOSITES) AND INTERNALLY AND SUPPLIER PRODUCED PARTS AND STRUCTURES, CONVERSION OF RAW MATERIALS INTO PARTS AND ASSEMBLIES, PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS AND REGULATORY CERTIFICATION. THE FAILURE OF ANY OR ALL OF THESE

FACTORS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT OUT-OF-SEQUENCE WORK AND DISRUPTED PROCESS FLOWS ADVERSELY AFFECTING PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AND PROGRAM/CONTRACT PROFITABILITY, THE LATTER THROUGH INCREASED COSTS AS WELL AS POSSIBLE CUSTOMER AND/OR SUPPLIER CLAIMS

OR ASSERTIONS. IN ADDITION, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND MAJOR DERIVATIVE AIRCRAFT INVOLVES INCREASED RISK ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND CERTIFICATION SCHEDULES.

MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR ABILITY TO SELL AIRCRAFT INTO THE FUTURE.

THE WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT IS

PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY LONG-TERM TRENDS IN AIRLINE PASSENGER AND CARGO TRAFFIC. THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS UNDERLYING LONG-TERM TRAFFIC GROWTH ARE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICAL STABILITY, BOTH IN DEVELOPED AND EMERGING COUNTRIES. DEMAND FOR

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS FURTHER INFLUENCED BY AIRLINE INDUSTRY PROFITABILITY, WORLD TRADE POLICIES, AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING, GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, TERRORISM, DISEASE OUTBREAKS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED UPON AIRCRAFT

OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES AND PRICE AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS MAY REQUEST TO CANCEL, MODIFY OR

RESCHEDULE ORDERS.

WE GENERALLY MAKE SALES UNDER AIRCRAFT PURCHASE AGREEMENTS THAT MAY, FOR A VARIETY OF REASONS, BECOME THE SUBJECT OF CANCELLATION, MODIFICATION OR RESCHEDULING. CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION

OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY AND OUR CUSTOMERS COULD RESULT IN CUSTOMER REQUESTS TO RESCHEDULE OR CANCEL CONTRACTUAL ORDERS. OUR CONTRACTS HAVE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS RELATING TO SCHEDULE AND PERFORMANCE AND FAILURE TO DELIVER AIRPLANES IN ACCORDANCE WITH

SUCH PROVISIONS COULD RESULT IN CANCELLATIONS AND/OR CLAIMS FOR COMPENSATION. ANY SUCH CANCELLATIONS, MODIFICATION, RESCHEDULING OR CLAIMS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR BACKLOG, REVENUES, PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS.

6

TABLE OF CONTENTS

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRICING IS BASED IN PART ON ESCALATION FORMULAS ESTABLISHED WELL IN ADVANCE OF DELIVERY AND IS

THEREFORE SUBJECT TO FACTORS BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

PRICE ESCALATION PROVISIONS IN OUR SALES CONTRACTS ARE DESIGNED TO ADJUST FOR ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE CONTRACT DATE AND AIRCRAFT DELIVERY, A PERIOD WHICH CAN SPAN MANY YEARS. AS A

RESULT, AIRCRAFT PRICING GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A FIXED AMOUNT AS MODIFIED BY A PRICE ESCALATION FORMULA USING PRE-DEFINED FACTORS. OUR REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THESE ESCALATION FORMULAS. CHANGES IN

ESCALATION AMOUNTS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT REVENUES AND OPERATING MARGINS IN OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES BUSINESS.

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

OUR REVENUES FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINES.

WE CAN MAKE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY CUSTOMER WILL PURCHASE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM US AFTER OUR CONTRACT WITH THE CUSTOMER ENDS. IN ADDITION, FLEET DECISIONS,

CONSOLIDATION OR FINANCIAL CHALLENGES INVOLVING ANY OF OUR MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND LIMIT OUR OPPORTUNITY TO GENERATE PROFITS FROM THOSE CUSTOMERS.

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION RATES COULD CHANGE.

PRODUCTION RATE REDUCTIONS COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR DISRUPTION AND OTHER COSTS AND RESULT IN

INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS BEING ALLOCATED TO A SMALLER QUANTITY OF AIRPLANES, ALL OF WHICH COULD REDUCE OUR PROFITABILITY. THE INTRODUCTION OF A NEW AIRCRAFT PROGRAM AND/OR HIGHER ORDERS FOR OUR AIRCRAFT COULD LEAD TO PRODUCTION RATE INCREASES IN ORDER

TO MEET THE DELIVERY SCHEDULES. FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENT ANY PRODUCTION RATE CHANGES COULD LEAD TO EXTENDED DELIVERY COMMITMENTS, AND DEPENDING ON THE LENGTH OF DELAY IN MEETING DELIVERY COMMITMENTS, ADDITIONAL COSTS AND CUSTOMERS

RESCHEDULING THEIR DELIVERIES OR TERMINATING THEIR RELATED CONTRACT WITH US.

THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

DEPENDS UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS.

WE ARE CURRENTLY ENGAGED IN THE DEMANDING FLIGHT TESTING AND CERTIFICATION

PHASES OF PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT ON BOTH THE 787-8 AND 747-8 FREIGHTER AIRCRAFT. THESE AIRPLANES HAVE HIGHLY COMPLEX DESIGNS, UTILIZE EXOTIC MATERIALS AND REQUIRE EXTENSIVE COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION WITH SUPPLIER PARTNERS. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY

TO DELIVER AIRCRAFT ON TIME, MEET CONTRACTUAL PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS AND ACHIEVE PROGRAM PROFITABILITY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS.

OPERATIONAL

ISSUES, INCLUDING DELAYS OR DEFECTS IN SUPPLIER COMPONENTS, THE INABILITY TO EFFICIENTLY AND COST-EFFECTIVELY INCORPORATE DESIGN CHANGES INTO PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT, AND AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE ISSUES, COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL EXPENSES OR LOWER PROGRAM

REVENUES. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2009 WE DETERMINED THAT THREE OF THE SIX 787 FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT COULD NOT BE SOLD DUE TO THE INORDINATE AMOUNT OF WORK THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PREPARE THE AIRCRAFT FOR SALE. AS A RESULT, WE RECLASSIFIED $2.7 BILLION

FROM INVENTORY TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. IF WE DETERMINE THAT ONE OR MORE OF THE OTHER FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT WILL NOT BE SOLD, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL CHARGES. IN ADDITION, FLIGHT TESTING AND CERTIFICATION DELAYS OR SUPPLIER OR OTHER

OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES THAT IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO ACHIEVE OUR TARGETED PRODUCTION RATES MAY RESULT IN AIRCRAFT DELIVERY DELAYS AND HIGHER COSTS TO COMPLETE. FOR EXAMPLE, ON JANUARY 18, 2011, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE EXPECTED DATE OF FIRST DELIVERY

OF OUR 787 DREAMLINER HAD BEEN MOVED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011 DUE TO A COMBINATION OF FLIGHT TESTING DELAYS, SUPPLIER CHALLENGES AND OTHER ISSUES COMMON TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. OUR INABILITY TO DELIVER AIRCRAFT TO OUR

CUSTOMERS IN A TIMELY MANNER COULD RESULT IN ORDER CANCELLATIONS OR OTHER SIGNIFICANT FINANCIAL EXPOSURES, OR COULD OTHERWISE REDUCE THE PROFITABILITY OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES BUSINESS. WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS TO

ASSESS THE SPECIFIC IMPACT OF SCHEDULE CHANGES AND OTHERWISE TO ENSURE THAT OUR AIRCRAFT MEET CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS.

LOOKING BEYOND ENTRY INTO SERVICE

FOR THE 787-8 AND 747-8 FREIGHTER, WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD IMPROVING PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES AND SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE, INCORPORATING DESIGN CHANGES INTO AIRCRAFT

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THAT HAVE ALREADY BEEN PRODUCED, IMPROVING AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE, SUCCESSFULLY IMPLEMENTING PLANNED INCREASES IN PRODUCTION RATES AND INTRODUCING THE 787-9 AND 747-8 INTERCONTINENTAL AIRPLANES.

FOR EXAMPLE, WE ARE INCREASING PRODUCTION CAPACITY IN EVERETT AND CHARLESTON AND WORKING CLOSELY WITH OUR SUPPLIERS TO SUPPORT 787 PRODUCTION RATE INCREASES. IF ASSEMBLY LINE RAMP-UP EFFORTS ARE DELAYED OR IF OUR SUPPLIERS CANNOT TIMELY DELIVER

COMPONENTS TO US AT THE RATES NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE OUR PLANNED RATE INCREASES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MEET DELIVERY TARGETS AND THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR PROGRAMS MAY SUFFER.

MANAGEMENT USES ITS BEST JUDGMENT TO ESTIMATE THE COST TO PERFORM THE WORK, THE PRICE WE WILL EVENTUALLY BE PAID AND THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO INCLUDE IN THE INITIAL

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. CHANGES TO ESTIMATES OF THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, CUSTOMER AND MODEL MIX, PRODUCTION COSTS AND RATES, LEARNING CURVE, COSTS OF DERIVATIVE AIRCRAFT, CUSTOMER NEGOTIATIONS/SETTLEMENTS, SUPPLIER CLAIMS AND CERTIFICATION

ISSUES COULD AFFECT MARGINS OR RESULT IN REACH-FORWARD LOSSES. THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF PRODUCTION CHALLENGES, SCHEDULE DELAYS AND CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER IMPACTS HAS RESULTED IN A REACH-FORWARD LOSS ON THE 747 PROGRAM AND CONTINUES TO PLACE

SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON REVENUES, COSTS AND THE PROFITABILITY OF THE 787 PROGRAM.

OUR BDS BUSINESS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED BY CHANGING

ACQUISITION PRIORITIES OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, PARTICULARLY THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE, INCLUDING AN INCREASED EMPHASIS ON AFFORDABILITY.

THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT PARTICIPATES IN AN INCREASINGLY WIDE VARIETY OF OPERATIONS, INCLUDING HOMELAND DEFENSE, NATURAL DISASTERS, STABILIZATION EFFORTS, COUNTERINSURGENCY AND COUNTERTERRORISM, THAT EMPLOY OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT,

PRIMARILY OPERATING THROUGH THE U.S. DOD, CONTINUES TO ADJUST ITS FUNDING PRIORITIES IN RESPONSE TO THIS CHANGING THREAT ENVIRONMENT. IN ADDITION, DEFENSE FUNDING CURRENTLY FACES PRESSURES DUE TO THE OVERALL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND COMPETING BUDGET

PRIORITIES. DUE TO THESE PRESSURES, WE EXPECT THE TOTAL U.S. DOD BUDGET GROWTH RATE TO REMAIN STABLE OR EVEN DECLINE SLIGHTLY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS. ANY REDUCTION IN THE GROWTH RATE OR OVERALL LEVELS OF U.S. DOD SPENDING OR CANCELLATIONS OR

DELAYS IMPACTING EXISTING CONTRACTS COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE OPERATING RESULTS OF OUR BDS BUSINESS. WE ALSO EXPECT THAT THE U.S. DOD WILL CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE COST-CUTTING AND OTHER EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES IN ITS PROCUREMENT PROCESSES.

THESE INITIATIVES WILL REQUIRE US AND OUR COMPETITORS TO FOCUS INCREASINGLY ON LONG-TERM COST COMPETITIVENESS AND AFFORDABILITY WHEN RESPONDING TO PROPOSALS AND/OR PURSUING DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS. IF THE PRIORITIES OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CHANGE AND/OR

WE ARE UNABLE TO MEET AFFORDABILITY TARGETS, OUR BDS REVENUES AND PROFITABILITY COULD BE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED.

WE DEPEND HEAVILY ON U.S.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS.

IN 2010, 43% OF OUR REVENUES WERE DERIVED FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. IN ADDITION

TO NORMAL BUSINESS RISKS, OUR CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS, SOME OF WHICH ARE BEYOND OUR CONTROL.

THE FUNDING OF

U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IS SUBJECT TO CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS

. MANY OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE MAY LAST SEVERAL YEARS; HOWEVER, THESE PROGRAMS ARE NORMALLY FUNDED ANNUALLY. CHANGES IN MILITARY STRATEGY AND

PRIORITIES MAY AFFECT OUR FUTURE PROCUREMENT OPPORTUNITIES AND EXISTING PROGRAMS. LONG-TERM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS AND RELATED ORDERS ARE SUBJECT TO CANCELLATION, DELAY OR RESTRUCTURE, IF APPROPRIATIONS FOR SUBSEQUENT PERFORMANCE PERIODS ARE NOT MADE.

THE TERMINATION OR REDUCTION OF FUNDING FOR EXISTING OR NEW U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOW AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY MODIFY, CURTAIL OR TERMINATE OUR CONTRACTS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY MODIFY, CURTAIL OR TERMINATE ITS CONTRACTS AND SUBCONTRACTS WITH US, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE AND AT ITS CONVENIENCE

8

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UPON PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COMMITMENTS MADE AT THE TIME OF TERMINATION. MODIFICATION, CURTAILMENT OR TERMINATION OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR MAJOR PROGRAMS OR CONTRACTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR CONTRACT COSTS ARE SUBJECT TO AUDITS BY U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES

. U.S.

GOVERNMENT REPRESENTATIVES MAY AUDIT THE COSTS WE INCUR ON OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, INCLUDING ALLOCATED INDIRECT COSTS. SUCH AUDITS COULD RESULT IN ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR CONTRACT COSTS. ANY COSTS FOUND TO BE IMPROPERLY ALLOCATED TO A SPECIFIC

CONTRACT WILL NOT BE REIMBURSED, AND SUCH COSTS ALREADY REIMBURSED MUST BE REFUNDED. WE HAVE RECORDED CONTRACT REVENUES BASED UPON COSTS WE EXPECT TO REALIZE UPON FINAL AUDIT. HOWEVER, WE DO NOT KNOW THE OUTCOME OF ANY FUTURE AUDITS AND ADJUSTMENTS

AND WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR PROFITS UPON COMPLETION AND FINAL NEGOTIATION OF AUDITS. IF ANY AUDIT UNCOVERS IMPROPER OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS, INCLUDING

TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS, FORFEITURE OF PROFITS, SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS, FINES AND SUSPENSION OR PROHIBITION FROM DOING BUSINESS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT.

OUR BUSINESS IS SUBJECT TO POTENTIAL U.S. GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS.

WE ARE SOMETIMES SUBJECT TO CERTAIN U.S. GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS DUE TO OUR PARTICIPATION IN GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS. ANY SUCH INQUIRY OR INVESTIGATION COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT BUSINESS IS ALSO SUBJECT TO SPECIFIC PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS AND OTHER REQUIREMENTS.

THESE REQUIREMENTS, ALTHOUGH CUSTOMARY IN U.S.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, INCREASE OUR PERFORMANCE AND COMPLIANCE COSTS. THESE COSTS MIGHT INCREASE IN THE FUTURE, REDUCING OUR MARGINS, WHICH COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH THESE REGULATIONS AND

REQUIREMENTS COULD LEAD TO SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT, OR WITHHOLDING OF REVENUE AND PROFIT, FOR CAUSE, FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING OR SUBCONTRACTING FOR A PERIOD OF TIME AND COULD HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON OUR REPUTATION AND ABILITY TO SECURE

FUTURE U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

WE ENTER INTO FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO LOSSES IF WE HAVE COST OVERRUNS.

APPROXIMATELY 55% OF BDS REVENUES ARE GENERATED FROM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS. WHILE FIRM FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS ENABLE US TO BENEFIT FROM

PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS, COST REDUCTIONS AND EFFICIENCIES, THEY ALSO SUBJECT US TO THE RISK OF REDUCED MARGINS OR INCURRING LOSSES IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE ESTIMATED COSTS AND REVENUES. IF OUR ESTIMATED COSTS EXCEED OUR ESTIMATED PRICE, WE

RECOGNIZE REACH-FORWARD LOSSES WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR REPORTED RESULTS. THE LONG TERM NATURE OF MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS MAKES THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING COSTS AND REVENUES ON FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS INHERENTLY RISKY. FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS

OFTEN CONTAIN PRICE INCENTIVES AND PENALTIES TIED TO PERFORMANCE WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE AND HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON MARGINS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR CONTRACTS HAVE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS RELATING TO COST, SCHEDULE AND PERFORMANCE.

FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO MORE UNCERTAINTY THAN FIXED-PRICE PRODUCTION CONTRACTS. MANY OF THESE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

HAVE HIGHLY COMPLEX DESIGNS. IF WE FAIL TO MEET THE TERMS SPECIFIED IN THOSE CONTRACTS, OUR SALES PRICE COULD BE REDUCED. AS TECHNICAL OR QUALITY ISSUES ARISE, WE MAY EXPERIENCE SCHEDULE DELAYS AND HIGHER COSTS TO COMPLETE, WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. EXAMPLES OF SIGNIFICANT BDS FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS INCLUDE AEW&C, KC-767 INTERNATIONAL TANKER, P-8I AND COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY SATELLITES.

WE ENTER INTO COST-TYPE CONTRACTS WHICH ALSO CARRY RISKS.

APPROXIMATELY 45% OF BDS REVENUES ARE

GENERATED FROM COST-TYPE CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENTS. SOME OF THESE ARE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT HAVE COMPLEX DESIGN AND TECHNICAL CHALLENGES. THESE COST-TYPE PROGRAMS TYPICALLY HAVE AWARD OR INCENTIVE FEES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY AND MAY BE

EARNED OVER

9

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EXTENDED PERIODS. IN THESE CASES THE ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL RISKS ARE PRIMARILY IN LOWER PROFIT RATES OR PROGRAM CANCELLATION IF COST, SCHEDULE OR TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUES ARISE. PROGRAMS

WHOSE CONTRACTS ARE PRIMARILY COST-TYPE INCLUDE GMD, BCTM, P-8A POSEIDON, PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS, JTRS, FAB-T AND THE EA-18G GROWLER.

WE ENTER

INTO CONTRACTS THAT INCLUDE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THAT SUBJECT US TO RISKS.

CONTRACTS IN THE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE INDUSTRY AND CERTAIN

GOVERNMENT SATELLITE CONTRACTS INCLUDE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. THESE IN-ORBIT PAYMENTS MAY BE PAID OVER TIME AFTER FINAL SATELLITE ACCEPTANCE OR PAID IN FULL PRIOR TO FINAL SATELLITE ACCEPTANCE. IN BOTH CASES, THE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENT IS

AT RISK IF THE SATELLITE DOES NOT PERFORM TO SPECIFICATIONS FOR UP TO 15 YEARS AFTER ACCEPTANCE. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE FEES WE ULTIMATELY EXPECT TO REALIZE IS RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE IN THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD. IF

THE SATELLITE FAILS TO MEET CONTRACTUAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, CUSTOMERS WILL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO CONTINUE MAKING IN-ORBIT PAYMENTS AND/OR WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE REFUNDS TO THE CUSTOMER AND INCUR SIGNIFICANT CHARGES.

WE USE ESTIMATES IN ACCOUNTING FOR MANY CONTRACTS AND PROGRAMS. CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

CONTRACT AND PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRE JUDGMENT RELATIVE TO ASSESSING RISKS, ESTIMATING REVENUES AND COSTS AND MAKING ASSUMPTIONS FOR SCHEDULE

AND TECHNICAL ISSUES. DUE TO THE SIZE AND NATURE OF MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS AND PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATION OF TOTAL REVENUES AND COST AT COMPLETION IS COMPLICATED AND SUBJECT TO MANY VARIABLES. ASSUMPTIONS HAVE TO BE MADE REGARDING THE LENGTH OF TIME TO

COMPLETE THE CONTRACT OR PROGRAM BECAUSE COSTS ALSO INCLUDE EXPECTED INCREASES IN WAGES, MATERIAL PRICES AND ALLOCATED FIXED COSTS. INCENTIVES OR PENALTIES RELATED TO PERFORMANCE ON CONTRACTS ARE CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING SALES AND PROFIT RATES, AND

ARE RECORDED WHEN THERE IS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR US TO ASSESS ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE. SUPPLIERS ASSERTIONS ARE ALSO ASSESSED AND CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING COSTS AND PROFIT RATES. ESTIMATES OF AWARD FEES ARE ALSO USED IN SALES AND PROFIT

RATES BASED ON ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED AWARDS.

UNDER PROGRAM ACCOUNTING, INVENTORIABLE PRODUCTION COSTS (INCLUDING OVERHEAD), PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS AND

ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED AND CHARGED AS COST OF SALES BY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF BY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR CONTRACTS. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING,

LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS LIMITED BY THE ABILITY TO MAKE REASONABLY DEPENDABLE ESTIMATES. TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP OF SALES TO COST OF SALES, PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF

(A) THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN A PROGRAM, (B) THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE UNITS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED AND (C) THE UNITS EXPECTED SALES PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING AND ROUTINE

WARRANTY COSTS FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM. SEVERAL FACTORS DETERMINE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, INCLUDING FIRM ORDERS, LETTERS OF INTENT FROM PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS AND MARKET STUDIES. SUCH ESTIMATES ARE RECONSIDERED THROUGHOUT THE LIFE OF OUR PROGRAMS. CHANGES

IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE, CIRCUMSTANCES OR ESTIMATES CONCERNING THE SELECTION OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY OR CHANGES IN MARKET CONDITIONS, ALONG WITH A FAILURE TO REALIZE PREDICTED COSTS, MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE.

BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATION PROCESSES DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS LIKELY THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT SALES AND

PROFIT AMOUNTS COULD BE RECORDED IF WE USED DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR IF THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, CIRCUMSTANCES OR ESTIMATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE PERIOD FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. FOR

COMPETITION WITHIN OUR MARKETS MAY REDUCE OUR FUTURE CONTRACTS AND SALES.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND ONE OR MORE OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE MORE EXTENSIVE OR MORE SPECIALIZED ENGINEERING, MANUFACTURING AND

MARKETING CAPABILITIES THAN WE DO IN SOME AREAS. IN OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES BUSINESS, WE ANTICIPATE INCREASING COMPETITION AMONG NON-U.S. AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR MARKET SEGMENTS. IN OUR BDS BUSINESS, WE

ANTICIPATE THAT THE EFFECTS OF DEFENSE INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION AND NEW PRIORITIES, INCLUDING LONG-TERM COST COMPETITIVENESS, OF OUR U.S. DOD CUSTOMER WILL INTENSIFY COMPETITION FOR MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FURTHERMORE, WE ARE FACING

INCREASED INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION AND CROSS-BORDER CONSOLIDATION OF COMPETITION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST OUR CURRENT OR FUTURE COMPETITORS OR THAT THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WE FACE WILL NOT

RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUES AND MARKET SHARE.

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM NON-U.S. SALES AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF

DOING BUSINESS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

IN 2010, SALES TO NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR 41% OF OUR REVENUES. WE EXPECT THAT NON-U.S. SALES WILL

CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING.

·

CHANGES IN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS;

·

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS TO EXPEND A PORTION OF PROGRAM FUNDS LOCALLY AND GOVERNMENTAL INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION OR

PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS;

·

FLUCTUATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES;

·

VOLATILITY IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS AND CHANGES IN NON-U.S. NATIONAL PRIORITIES AND BUDGETS, WHICH CAN LEAD TO DELAYS OR FLUCTUATIONS

IN ORDERS;

·

THE COMPLEXITY AND NECESSITY OF USING NON-U.S. REPRESENTATIVES AND CONSULTANTS;

·

THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ABILITY OF NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS TO FINANCE PURCHASES;

·

UNCERTAINTIES AND RESTRICTIONS CONCERNING THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING CREDIT OR GUARANTEES;

·

IMPOSITION OF TAXES, EXPORT CONTROLS, TARIFFS, EMBARGOES AND OTHER TRADE RESTRICTIONS;

·

THE DIFFICULTY OF MANAGEMENT AND OPERATION OF AN ENTERPRISE SPREAD OVER VARIOUS COUNTRIES;

·

COMPLIANCE WITH A VARIETY OF INTERNATIONAL LAWS, AS WELL AS U.S. LAWS AFFECTING THE ACTIVITIES OF U.S. COMPANIES ABROAD; AND

·

ECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL DEVELOPMENTS AND CONDITIONS.

WHILE THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE FACTORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.

THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION AND OF GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING OUR BUSINESS IS UNPREDICTABLE AND AN ADVERSE DECISION IN ANY SUCH MATTER COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY PAYMENTS AND

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS. THESE

CLAIMS MAY DIVERT FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE USED TO BENEFIT OUR OPERATIONS. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE RESULTS OF THESE MATTERS WILL BE FAVORABLE TO US. AN ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THESE LAWSUITS COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE AFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SOMETIMES SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS DUE, AMONG OTHER

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THINGS, TO OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE U.S GOVERNMENT, THE HEAVILY REGULATED NATURE OF OUR INDUSTRY, AND IN THE CASE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS, OUR OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN PROPERTY. ANY

SUCH INQUIRY OR INVESTIGATION COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN AN ADVERSE RULING AGAINST US, WHICH COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY PAYMENTS (INCLUDING POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS) AND A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION

AND OPERATING RESULTS.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR AND BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATIONS CUSTOMER FINANCING PORTFOLIO IS CONCENTRATED AMONG

CERTAIN CUSTOMERS BASED IN THE UNITED STATES, AND IN CERTAIN TYPES OF BOEING AIRCRAFT, WHICH EXPOSES US TO CONCENTRATION RISKS.

A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF OUR CUSTOMER FINANCING PORTFOLIO IS CONCENTRATED AMONG CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AND IN DISTINCT GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR PORTFOLIO IS ALSO CONCENTRATED BY VARYING DEGREES ACROSS BOEING AIRCRAFT PRODUCT TYPES,

MOST NOTABLY BOEING 717 AIRCRAFT. IF ONE OR MORE CUSTOMERS HOLDING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO ASSETS EXPERIENCES FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, OR OTHERWISE DEFAULTS ON OR DOES NOT RENEW ITS LEASES WITH US AT THEIR EXPIRATION, AND WE ARE UNABLE

TO REDEPLOY THE AIRCRAFT ON REASONABLE TERMS, OR IF THE TYPES OF AIRCRAFT THAT ARE CONCENTRATED IN OUR PORTFOLIO SUFFER GREATER THAN EXPECTED DECLINES IN VALUE, OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY

AFFECTED.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN DEBT TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS AT COMPETITIVE RATES, ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE

TERMS OR IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS.

WE DEPEND, IN PART, UPON THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS. IF WE WERE

CALLED UPON TO FUND ALL OUTSTANDING FINANCING COMMITMENTS, OUR MARKET LIQUIDITY MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT. A NUMBER OF FACTORS COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR INCREASED BORROWING COSTS AND TO HAVE GREATER DIFFICULTY ACCESSING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MARKETS FOR

DEBT. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE DISRUPTIONS OR DECLINES IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND/OR A DECLINE IN OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OR OUTLOOK OR CREDIT RATINGS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OR ALL OF THESE EVENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR

OPERATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL OR FINANCING COMMITMENTS.

WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, JOINT

VENTURES/STRATEGIC ALLIANCES OR DIVESTITURES.

AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE MAY MERGE WITH OR ACQUIRE BUSINESSES, FORM JOINT

VENTURES/STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AND DIVEST OPERATIONS. WHETHER WE REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS DEPENDS, IN PART, UPON THE INTEGRATION BETWEEN THE BUSINESSES INVOLVED, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING PRODUCTS, CAPABILITIES

OR TECHNOLOGIES AND THE MANAGEMENT OF THE TRANSACTED OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED FROM UNANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE ISSUES, TRANSACTION-RELATED CHARGES, AMORTIZATION OF EXPENSES RELATED TO INTANGIBLES,

CHARGES FOR IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-TERM ASSETS, CREDIT GUARANTEES, PARTNER PERFORMANCE AND INDEMNIFICATIONS. CONSOLIDATIONS OF JOINT VENTURES COULD ALSO IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED

APPROPRIATE AND ADEQUATE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. DIVESTITURES MAY RESULT IN CONTINUED FINANCIAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES, SUCH AS THROUGH

GUARANTEES OR OTHER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS, FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTION. NONPERFORMANCE BY THOSE DIVESTED BUSINESSES COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER ALL SIGNIFICANT RISK EXPOSURES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO

LIABILITIES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE PROVIDE. WHILE WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN RISKS AND, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MAY RECEIVE INDEMNIFICATION FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, INSURANCE CANNOT BE OBTAINED TO PROTECT AGAINST

ALL RISKS AND LIABILITIES. IT IS

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THEREFORE POSSIBLE THAT THE AMOUNT OF OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT COVER ALL CLAIMS OR LIABILITIES, AND WE MAY BE FORCED TO BEAR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE, LIABILITIES ARISING FROM THE USE

OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS AIRCRAFT TECHNOLOGIES, MISSILE SYSTEMS, BORDER SECURITY SYSTEMS, AND/OR AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS MAY NOT BE INSURABLE ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. WHILE MANY OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE SHIELDED FROM

LIABILITY WITHIN THE U.S. UNDER THE SAFETY ACT PROVISIONS OF THE 2002 HOMELAND SECURITY ACT, NO SUCH PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE U.S., POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES. THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE WE ARE ABLE TO MAINTAIN

MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER THESE OR OTHER CLAIMS OR LIABILITIES.

BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS COULD SERIOUSLY AFFECT OUR FUTURE SALES AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION OR INCREASE OUR COSTS AND EXPENSES.

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE IMPACTED BY DISRUPTIONS INCLUDING THREATS TO PHYSICAL SECURITY, INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY ATTACKS OR FAILURES, DAMAGING WEATHER OR OTHER ACTS OF NATURE AND PANDEMICS OR OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES. ANY OF THESE DISRUPTIONS COULD AFFECT OUR INTERNAL OPERATIONS OR SERVICES PROVIDED TO CUSTOMERS, AND COULD IMPACT OUR SALES,

INCREASE OUR EXPENSES OR ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REPUTATION OR OUR STOCK PRICE.

SOME OF OUR AND OUR SUPPLIERS' WORKFORCES ARE REPRESENTED BY LABOR

UNIONS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO WORK STOPPAGES.

APPROXIMATELY 57,400 EMPLOYEES, WHICH CONSTITUTE 36% OF OUR TOTAL WORKFORCE, ARE UNION REPRESENTED AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. WE EXPERIENCED A WORK STOPPAGE IN 2008 WHEN A LABOR STRIKE HALTED COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND CERTAIN BMA PROGRAM PRODUCTION AND WE MAY EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL WORK STOPPAGES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS. WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW STABLE OUR RELATIONSHIPS, CURRENTLY WITH 14 DIFFERENT U.S. LABOR ORGANIZATIONS AND 7 DIFFERENT NON-U.S. LABOR ORGANIZATIONS, WILL BE OR WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THE UNIONS REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT IMPACTING

OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE UNIONS MAY ALSO LIMIT OUR FLEXIBILITY IN DEALING WITH OUR WORKFORCE. UNION ACTIONS AT SUPPLIERS CAN ALSO AFFECT US. WORK STOPPAGES AND INSTABILITY IN OUR UNION RELATIONSHIPS COULD DELAY THE PRODUCTION AND/OR DEVELOPMENT

OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD STRAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND CAUSE A LOSS OF REVENUES WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.

SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DISCOUNT RATES, ACTUAL INVESTMENT RETURN ON PENSION ASSETS AND OTHER FACTORS COULD AFFECT OUR EARNINGS, EQUITY, AND PENSION

CONTRIBUTIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS.

OUR EARNINGS MAY BE POSITIVELY OR NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY THE AMOUNT OF INCOME OR EXPENSE WE RECORD FOR OUR

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS. GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP) REQUIRE THAT WE CALCULATE INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR THE PLANS USING ACTUARIAL VALUATIONS. THESE VALUATIONS REFLECT

ASSUMPTIONS RELATING TO FINANCIAL MARKET AND OTHER ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN KEY ECONOMIC INDICATORS CAN CHANGE THE ASSUMPTIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT YEAR-END ASSUMPTIONS USED TO ESTIMATE PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT INCOME OR EXPENSE FOR

THE FOLLOWING YEAR ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS AND EXPECTED FUTURE MEDICAL INFLATION. IN ADDITION, WE ARE REQUIRED TO MAKE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF PLAN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WHICH MAY RESULT IN A

SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY. FOR A DISCUSSION REGARDING HOW OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CAN BE AFFECTED BY PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLAN ACCOUNTING POLICIES, SEE MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSISCRITICAL

ACCOUNTING POLICIESPOSTRETIREMENT PLANS ON PAGES 4647 OF THIS FORM 10-K. ALTHOUGH GAAP EXPENSE AND PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT CONTRIBUTIONS ARE NOT DIRECTLY RELATED, THE KEY ECONOMIC FACTORS THAT AFFECT GAAP EXPENSE WOULD ALSO

LIKELY AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CASH OR COMMON STOCK WE WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO THE PENSION OR OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS. POTENTIAL PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS INCLUDE BOTH MANDATORY AMOUNTS REQUIRED UNDER FEDERAL LAW EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT

(ERISA) AND DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO IMPROVE THE PLANS FUNDED STATUS.

OUR OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO THE RISK OF MATERIAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE, TREATMENT, STORAGE,

DISPOSAL AND REMEDIATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND WASTES. WE COULD INCUR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS, INCLUDING CLEANUP COSTS, FINES AND CIVIL OR CRIMINAL SANCTIONS, AS WELL AS THIRD-PARTY CLAIMS FOR PROPERTY DAMAGE OR PERSONAL INJURY, IF WE WERE TO

VIOLATE OR BECOME LIABLE UNDER ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS OR REGULATIONS. IN SOME CASES, WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO SUCH COSTS DUE TO ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR CURRENT OR PAST MANUFACTURING OPERATIONS OR THE OPERATIONS OF COMPANIES WE HAVE

ACQUIRED. IN OTHER CASES, WE MAY BECOME SUBJECT TO SUCH COSTS DUE TO AN INDEMNIFICATION AGREEMENT BETWEEN US AND A THIRD PARTY RELATING TO SUCH ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES. IN ADDITION, NEW LAWS AND REGULATIONS, MORE STRINGENT ENFORCEMENT OF EXISTING

LAWS AND REGULATIONS, THE DISCOVERY OF PREVIOUSLY UNKNOWN CONTAMINATION OR THE IMPOSITION OF NEW REMEDIATION REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS. FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES, SEE NOTE 11 TO OUR

REVENUES IN 2010 DECREASED BY $3,975 MILLION OR 6% COMPARED WITH 2009. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES REVENUES DECREASED BY $2,217 MILLION DUE

TO LOWER 777 DELIVERIES PRIMARILY RESULTING FROM A PRODUCTION RATE CHANGE FROM 7 TO 5 PER MONTH BEGINNING IN JUNE 2010 AND NO DELIVERIES ON THE 747 PROGRAM DUE TO THE TRANSITION FROM THE 747-400 TO THE 747-8. THESE WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY

INCREASES IN COMMERCIAL AVIATION SERVICES BUSINESS. BDS REVENUES DECREASED BY $1,718 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES IN THE NETWORK & SPACE SYSTEMS (N&SS) SEGMENT.

REVENUES IN 2009 INCREASED BY $7,372 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2008 DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES IN COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES AND BDS. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES REVENUES INCREASED BY $5,788 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANE DELIVERIES IN 2009. DELIVERIES IN 2008 WERE LOWER AS A RESULT OF A

TABLE OF CONTENTS

LABOR STRIKE IN 2008. INCREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN COMMERCIAL AVIATION SERVICES AND INTERCOMPANY REVENUES. BDS REVENUES INCREASED BY $1,614 MILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER

REVENUES IN GLOBAL SERVICES & SUPPORT (GS&S) AND BOEING MILITARY AIRCRAFT (BMA), PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER REVENUES IN N&SS. BCC REVENUES DECREASED BY $43 MILLION DURING THE YEAR PRIMARILY DUE TO A DECREASE IN THE CUSTOMER FINANCING

PORTFOLIO. OTHER SEGMENT REVENUES DECREASED BY $402 MILLION PARTLY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES IN 2008 FROM THE SALE OF FOUR C-17 AIRCRAFT HELD UNDER OPERATING LEASE. LOWER UNALLOCATED ITEMS AND ELIMINATIONS IMPROVED REVENUES BY $415 MILLION PRIMARILY

DUE TO LOWER P-8A POSEIDON INTERCOMPANY REVENUES RECOGNIZED BY COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES IN 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008.

OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2010 INCREASED BY $2,875 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2009. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES EARNINGS INCREASED BY $3,589 MILLION,

PRIMARILY DUE TO $2,693 MILLION OF COSTS RELATED TO THE FIRST THREE 787 FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN 2009 AND THE 2009 REACH-FORWARD LOSSES ON THE 747 PROGRAM OF $1,352 MILLION. BDS EARNINGS DECREASED BY $424

MILLION COMPARED WITH 2009 DUE TO LOWER REVENUES AND MARGINS IN THE BMA SEGMENT AND LOWER REVENUES IN THE N&SS SEGMENT. OTHER SEGMENT EARNINGS DECREASED BY $175 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO $119 MILLION IN INTERCOMPANY GUARANTEES RELATED TO AIRCRAFT

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND REDUCED AIRCRAFT COLLATERAL VALUES.

OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2009 DECREASED BY $1,854 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2008. COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANES EARNINGS DECREASED BY $1,769 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO $2,693 MILLION OF COSTS RELATED TO THE FIRST THREE 787 FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AS A RESULT OF OUR DETERMINATION IN AUGUST 2009 THAT THESE

AIRCRAFT COULD NOT BE SOLD. THE EARNINGS DECREASE IS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO $1,352 MILLION IN REACH-FORWARD LOSSES ON THE 747 PROGRAM IN 2009, COMPARED WITH $667 MILLION IN 2008. LOWER COMMERCIAL AVIATION SERVICES AND INTERCOMPANY EARNINGS ALSO

CONTRIBUTED TO LOWER 2009 EARNINGS. THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DELIVERIES IN 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008. BDS EARNINGS INCREASED BY $67 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EARNINGS IN THE BMA

SEGMENT PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER EARNINGS IN THE N&SS SEGMENT. OTHER SEGMENT LOSSES DECREASED BY $155 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO RECOGNITION OF PRE-TAX EXPENSE OF $82 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR TO INCREASE THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON CUSTOMER

FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND LOWER ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION CHARGES COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. UNALLOCATED ITEMS AND ELIMINATIONS IN 2009 REDUCED EARNINGS BY $271 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2008, WHICH IS FURTHER EXPLAINED IN THE TABLE BELOW.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION EXPENSE DECREASED BY $46 MILLION IN 2010 AND INCREASED BY $381 MILLION IN 2009. THE YEAR OVER YEAR CHANGES IN DEFERRED

COMPENSATION EXPENSE ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY CHANGES IN OUR STOCK PRICE AND BROAD STOCK MARKET CONDITIONS.

OTHER UNALLOCATED ITEMS AND ELIMINATIONS

EXPENSE INCREASED BY $218 MILLION IN 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO TIMING OF INTERCOMPANY EXPENSE ALLOCATIONS AND ELIMINATION OF PROFIT ON INTERCOMPANY ITEMS AS WELL AS A $55 MILLION CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION. THE 2009 INCREASE OF $154 MILLION WAS PRIMARILY

DUE TO TIMING OF INTERCOMPANY EXPENSE ALLOCATIONS, ELIMINATION OF PROFIT ON INTERCOMPANY ITEMS AND A MORE FAVORABLE INSURANCE ADJUSTMENT.

UNALLOCATED

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE REPRESENTS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN COSTS RECOGNIZED UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA (GAAP) IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FEDERAL COST ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS REQUIRED TO BE UTILIZED BY OUR BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING PURPOSES. WE RECORDED NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST RELATED TO PENSIONS AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OF $1,864 MILLION, $1,816 MILLION AND $1,132 MILLION IN

2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. NOT ALL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD INCURRED BECAUSE IT IS ALLOCATED TO PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT COSTS AND A PORTION REMAINS IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF THE REPORTING PERIOD. A

OTHER INCOME INCREASED BY $78 MILLION IN 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO INVESTMENT INCOME ON HIGHER CASH AND INVESTMENT BALANCES THROUGHOUT

2010. THE DECREASE IN 2009 OF $273 MILLION WAS DRIVEN BY LOWER INVESTMENT INCOME DUE TO BOTH LOWER INTEREST RATES AND INVESTMENT BALANCES. INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE INCREASED BY $177 MILLION AND $137 MILLION IN 2010 AND 2009 DUE TO DEBT ISSUED IN

2009.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 26.5%, 22.9% AND 33.6% FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE

TAX RATE WAS HIGHER IN 2010, COMPARED WITH 2009, PRIMARILY BECAUSE PRE-TAX BOOK INCOME IN 2010 WAS HIGHER THAN IN 2009 AND BECAUSE OF AN INCOME TAX CHARGE OF $150 MILLION RECORDED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010 AS A RESULT OF THE PATIENT

PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AS MODIFIED BY THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A TAX BENEFIT OF $371 MILLION RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 AS A RESULT OF SETTLING THE 1998-2003

FEDERAL AUDIT. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER IN 2009, COMPARED WITH 2008, PRIMARILY BECAUSE TAX CREDITS, SUCH AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDITS, REPRESENTED A HIGHER PROPORTION OF EARNINGS BEFORE TAXES DUE TO THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR REDUCTION IN

EARNINGS. FOR ADDITIONAL DISCUSSION RELATED TO INCOME TAXES, SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

21

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG INCLUDES U.S. AND NON-U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFINITIVE CONTRACTS FOR WHICH FUNDING HAS NOT BEEN

AUTHORIZED. THE DECREASE IN UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG DURING 2010 IS DUE TO DECREASES AT BDS OF $1,993 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO FUNDING OF EXISTING MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS INCLUDING THE V-22, BRIGADE COMBAT TEAM MODERNIZATION (BCTM) AND

CHINOOK PROGRAMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY MULTI-YEAR PROCUREMENT CONTRACT AWARDS ON THE F/A-18 AND INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION PROGRAMS. THE DECREASE IN UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG DURING 2009 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASES AT BDS OF $8,904 MILLION COMPARED WITH

2008 PARTLY DUE TO A PARTIAL TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE BY THE U.S. ARMY OF THE BCTM SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION CONTRACT RELATING TO MANNED GROUND VEHICLES AND ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT. APPROVED FUNDING OF EXISTING MULTI-YEAR

CONTRACTS INCLUDING THE BCTM, V-22, CHINOOK, PROPRIETARY AND GMD PROGRAMS ALSO REDUCED UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG.

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

AIRLINE INDUSTRY

ENVIRONMENT

GLOBAL PASSENGER TRAFFIC EXCEEDED INITIAL EXPECTATIONS IN 2010 GROWING AN ESTIMATED 8% FOR THE YEAR AND SHOWING GROWTH OVER PRIOR 2008 PEAK LEVELS. SIGNIFICANT VARIATION EXISTED BETWEEN REGIONS AND AIRLINE BUSINESS MODELS WITH

EMERGING MARKETS AND LOW COST CARRIERS LEADING RECOVERY AND GROWTH INTO 2011. AIR CARGO TRAFFIC ALSO REBOUNDED IN 2010 AFTER TWO YEARS OF CONTRACTION. LED BY STRONG GROWTH IN ASIAN EXPORTS, AIR CARGO TRAFFIC RECOVERED TO PEAK 2007 LEVELS AND IS

POISED TO RESUME GROWTH IN 2011.

AIRLINES CUT CAPACITY IN 2009 TO MATCH THE DEMAND ENVIRONMENT WHICH ALLOWED THEM TO BOOST YIELDS AS DEMAND RECOVERED

IN 2010. AIRLINES HAVE ALSO PURSUED NEW REVENUE SOURCES BY EXPANDING ALLIANCES AND BUILDING ANCILLARY REVENUE STREAMS. IN ADDITION, AIRLINES CONTINUED TO FOCUS ON CUTTING COSTS AND PURSUED CONSOLIDATION OPPORTUNITIES, PARTICULARLY IN MATURE MARKETS,

TO IMPROVE MARKET POSITIONING. THESE AIRLINE TACTICS, COMBINED WITH IMPROVING DEMAND AND RELATIVELY STABLE FUEL PRICES, HAVE DRIVEN A STRONG TURNAROUND IN AIRLINE INDUSTRY PROFITABILITY. AIRLINES ARE FORECAST TO EARN $15 BILLION IN 2010 FOLLOWING A

$10 BILLION NET LOSS IN 2009. THE 2011 OUTLOOK IS FOR CONTINUED PROFITABILITY WHICH SHOULD ALLOW AIRLINES TO REBUILD BALANCE SHEETS THAT SUFFERED FROM FUEL PRICE SPIKES AND RECESSION IN 2008-2009.

THE LONG-TERM OUTLOOK FOR THE INDUSTRY REMAINS POSITIVE DUE TO THE FUNDAMENTAL DRIVERS OF AIR TRAVEL GROWTH: ECONOMIC GROWTH AND THE INCREASING PROPENSITY TO

TRAVEL DUE TO INCREASED TRADE, GLOBALIZATION AND IMPROVED AIRLINE SERVICES DRIVEN BY LIBERALIZATION OF AIR TRAFFIC RIGHTS BETWEEN COUNTRIES. OUR 20-YEAR FORECAST IS FOR A LONG-TERM AVERAGE GROWTH RATE OF 5% PER YEAR FOR PASSENGER AND CARGO

TRAFFIC BASED ON A PROJECTED AVERAGE ANNUAL WORLDWIDE REAL ECONOMIC GROWTH RATE OF 3%. BASED ON LONG-TERM GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH PROJECTIONS, AND FACTORING IN INCREASED UTILIZATION OF THE WORLDWIDE AIRPLANE FLEET AND REQUIREMENTS TO REPLACE OLDER

AIRPLANES, WE PROJECT A $3.6 TRILLION MARKET FOR 30,900 NEW AIRPLANES OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS.

THE INDUSTRY REMAINS VULNERABLE TO NEAR-TERM EXOGENOUS

DEVELOPMENTS INCLUDING FUEL PRICE SPIKES, DISEASE OUTBREAKS (SUCH AS AVIAN OR H1N1 FLU), TERRORISM, CONFLICTS AND INCREASED GLOBAL ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS.

INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS

THE COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT MARKET AND THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REMAIN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE EXPECT THE EXISTING LONG-TERM DOWNWARD TREND IN PASSENGER REVENUE YIELDS WORLDWIDE

(MEASURED IN REAL TERMS) TO CONTINUE INTO THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. MARKET LIBERALIZATION IN EUROPE AND ASIA HAS ENABLED LOW-COST AIRLINES TO CONTINUE GAINING MARKET SHARE. THESE AIRLINES HAVE INCREASED THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON AIRFARES. THIS RESULTS

IN CONTINUED COST PRESSURES FOR ALL AIRLINES AND PRICE PRESSURE ON OUR PRODUCTS. MAJOR PRODUCTIVITY GAINS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE A FAVORABLE MARKET POSITION AT ACCEPTABLE PROFIT MARGINS.

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONTINUED ACCESS TO GLOBAL MARKETS REMAINS VITAL TO OUR ABILITY TO FULLY REALIZE OUR SALES POTENTIAL AND LONG-TERM

INVESTMENT RETURNS. APPROXIMATELY 10% OF COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG IN DOLLAR TERMS IS WITH U.S. AIRLINES.

WE FACE AGGRESSIVE

INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS WHO ARE INTENT ON INCREASING THEIR MARKET SHARE. THEY OFFER COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND HAVE ACCESS TO MOST OF THE SAME CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS. AIRBUS HAS HISTORICALLY INVESTED HEAVILY TO CREATE A FAMILY OF PRODUCTS TO

COMPETE WITH OURS. REGIONAL JET MAKERS EMBRAER AND BOMBARDIER, COMING FROM THE LESS THAN 100-SEAT COMMERCIAL JET MARKET, CONTINUE TO DEVELOP LARGER AND MORE CAPABLE AIRPLANES. ADDITIONALLY, OTHER COMPETITORS FROM RUSSIA, CHINA AND JAPAN ARE LIKELY

TO ENTER THE 70 TO 190 SEAT AIRCRAFT MARKET OVER THE NEXT FEW YEARS. MANY OF THESE COMPETITORS HAVE HISTORICALLY ENJOYED ACCESS TO GOVERNMENT-PROVIDED SUPPORT, INCLUDING "LAUNCH AID," WHICH GREATLY REDUCES THE COMMERCIAL RISKS ASSOCIATED

WITH AIRPLANE DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AND ENABLES PLANES TO BE BROUGHT TO MARKET MORE QUICKLY THAN OTHERWISE POSSIBLE. THIS MARKET ENVIRONMENT HAS RESULTED IN INTENSE PRESSURES ON PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS AND WE EXPECT THESE

PRESSURES TO CONTINUE OR INTENSIFY IN THE COMING YEARS.

WORLDWIDE, AIRPLANE SALES ARE GENERALLY CONDUCTED IN U.S. DOLLARS. FLUCTUATING EXCHANGE RATES

AFFECT THE PROFIT POTENTIAL OF OUR MAJOR COMPETITORS, ALL OF WHOM HAVE SIGNIFICANT COSTS IN OTHER CURRENCIES. CHANGES IN VALUE OF THE U.S. DOLLAR RELATIVE TO THEIR LOCAL CURRENCIES AS EXPERIENCED IN 2010 IMPACTED COMPETITORS REVENUES AND

PROFITS. COMPETITORS ROUTINELY RESPOND TO RELATIVELY WEAKER DOLLARS BY AGGRESSIVELY REDUCING COSTS AND INCREASING PRODUCTIVITY, THEREBY IMPROVING THEIR LONGER-TERM COMPETITIVE POSTURE. AIRBUS HAS ANNOUNCED SUCH INITIATIVES TARGETING OVERHEAD COST

SAVINGS, A REDUCTION IN ITS DEVELOPMENT CYCLE AND A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OVERALL PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH 2012. IF THE U.S. DOLLAR STRENGTHENS AGAIN, AIRBUS CAN USE THE IMPROVED EFFICIENCY TO FUND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, GAIN MARKET SHARE THROUGH

PRICING AND/OR IMPROVE EARNINGS.

WE ARE FOCUSED ON IMPROVING OUR PROCESSES AND CONTINUING COST-REDUCTION EFFORTS. WE CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE OUR EXTENSIVE

CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES NETWORK WHICH INCLUDES AVIATION SUPPORT, SPARES, TRAINING, MAINTENANCE DOCUMENTS AND TECHNICAL ADVICE FOR AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THIS ENABLES US TO PROVIDE A HIGH LEVEL OF CUSTOMER SATISFACTION AND PRODUCTIVITY.

THESE EFFORTS ENHANCE OUR ABILITY TO PURSUE PRICING STRATEGIES THAT ENABLE US TO PRICE COMPETITIVELY.

REVENUES FOR 2010 DECREASED BY $2,217 MILLION OR 6.5% COMPARED WITH 2009. THE DECREASE IN NEW AIRPLANE REVENUES PRIMARILY REFLECTS

LOWER 777 DELIVERIES RESULTING FROM A PRODUCTION RATE CHANGE FROM 7 TO 5 PER MONTH BEGINNING IN JUNE 2010 AND NO DELIVERIES ON THE 747 PROGRAM DUE TO THE TRANSITION FROM THE 747-400 TO THE 747-8 DERIVATIVE. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES FROM

COMMERCIAL AVIATION SERVICES BUSINESS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED SALES OF SPARES.

THE INCREASE IN REVENUE OF $5,788 MILLION IN 2009 FROM 2008 WAS

PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO HIGHER NEW AIRPLANE DELIVERIES PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTERCOMPANY REVENUES. 2008 REVENUES WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY A 2008 IAM STRIKE. THE DECREASE IN REVENUES FROM COMMERCIAL AVIATION SERVICES BUSINESS WAS DRIVEN BY

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS.

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS FOR 2010

INCREASED BY $3,589 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2009. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE 2009 RECLASSIFICATION FROM INVENTORY TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE OF COSTS RELATED TO THE FIRST THREE 787 FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT, AND THE 2009 REACH-FORWARD

LOSSES ON THE 747 PROGRAM. COSTS OF $2,693 MILLION INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN 2009 FOR THE FIRST THREE FLIGHT TEST 787 AIRPLANES WERE A RESULT OF OUR DETERMINATION THAT THESE AIRCRAFT COULD NOT BE SOLD. THE REACH-FORWARD LOSS ON

THE 747 PROGRAM OF $1,352 MILLION DURING 2009 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PRODUCTION COSTS, REDUCTIONS IN PROJECTED DELIVERY PRICE INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH ESCALATION AND THE DIFFICULT MARKET CONDITIONS AFFECTING THE 747-8. THE REMAINING NET

DECREASE IN EARNINGS FOR 2010 WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO INCREASED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE OF $285 MILLION AND LOWER NEW AIRPLANE DELIVERIES.

24

TABLE OF CONTENTS

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS FOR 2009 DECREASED BY $1,769 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2008, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE

RECLASSIFICATION FROM INVENTORY TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE OF THE THREE 787 FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AS INVENTORY, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $148 MILLION DECREASE IN OTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. THE DECREASE IN

EARNINGS IS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO $1,352 MILLION IN REACH-FORWARD LOSSES ON THE 747 PROGRAM IN 2009, COMPARED WITH $685 MILLION IN 2008. LOWER COMMERCIAL AVIATION SERVICES REVENUES AND MARGINS REDUCED EARNINGS BY $245 MILLION. HIGHER INFRASTRUCTURE

COST ALLOCATIONS RELATED TO THE 787 AND 747-8 SCHEDULE DELAYS ANNOUNCED IN 2008 AND 2009 AND INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS INCURRED DURING THE 2008 IAM STRIKE REDUCED EARNINGS BY $199 MILLION. INCREASED PERIOD AND OTHER COSTS REDUCED EARNINGS BY $47 MILLION.

THESE DECREASES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED EARNINGS OF $1,934 MILLION RELATED TO NEW AIRPLANE DELIVERIES.

BACKLOG

FIRM BACKLOG

REPRESENTS ORDERS FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WHERE NO CONTINGENCIES REMAIN BEFORE BOEING AND THE CUSTOMER ARE REQUIRED TO PERFORM. BACKLOG DOES NOT INCLUDE PROSPECTIVE ORDERS WHERE CUSTOMER CONTROLLED CONTINGENCIES REMAIN, SUCH AS THE CUSTOMERS

RECEIVING APPROVAL FROM THEIR BOARD OF DIRECTORS, SHAREHOLDERS OR GOVERNMENT AND COMPLETING FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. ALL SUCH CONTINGENCIES MUST BE SATISFIED OR HAVE EXPIRED PRIOR TO RECORDING A NEW FIRM ORDER EVEN IF SATISFYING SUCH CONDITIONS IS

HIGHLY CERTAIN. FIRM ORDERS EXCLUDE OPTIONS. A NUMBER OF OUR CUSTOMERS MAY HAVE CONTRACTUAL REMEDIES THAT MAY BE IMPLICATED BY PROGRAM DELAYS. WE CONTINUE TO ADDRESS CUSTOMER CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR OTHER CONTRACTUAL RELIEF AS THEY ARISE. HOWEVER,

ONCE ORDERS ARE INCLUDED IN FIRM BACKLOG, ORDERS REMAIN IN BACKLOG UNTIL CANCELED OR FULFILLED, ALTHOUGH THE VALUE OF ORDERS IS ADJUSTED AS CHANGES TO PRICE AND SCHEDULE ARE AGREED TO WITH CUSTOMERS.

THE INCREASE IN CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG DURING 2010 WAS DUE TO ORDERS IN EXCESS OF DELIVERIES AND CHANGES IN PROJECTED REVENUE ESCALATION, PARTIALLY REDUCED BY

CANCELLATIONS OF ORDERS. THE DECREASE IN BACKLOG DURING 2009 WAS DUE TO DELIVERIES IN EXCESS OF ORDERS, CHANGES IN PROJECTED REVENUE ESCALATION AND CANCELLATIONS OF ORDERS.

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY IS OUR ESTIMATE OF THE QUANTITY OF AIRPLANES THAT WILL BE PRODUCED FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNTING

QUANTITY IS LIMITED BY THE ABILITY TO MAKE REASONABLY DEPENDABLE ESTIMATES OF THE REVENUE AND COST OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. IT IS A KEY DETERMINANT OF THE GROSS MARGINS WE RECOGNIZE ON SALES OF INDIVIDUAL AIRPLANES THROUGHOUT A

PROGRAMS LIFE. ESTIMATION OF EACH PROGRAMS ACCOUNTING QUANTITY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SEVERAL FACTORS THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF THE DEMAND FOR THAT PROGRAM, INCLUDING FIRM ORDERS, LETTERS OF INTENT FROM PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS AND MARKET STUDIES.

WE REVIEW OUR PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITIES QUARTERLY.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION COSTS INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS, A

PORTION OF WHICH DOES NOT VARY WITH PRODUCTION RATES. AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME NEEDED TO PRODUCE THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY INCREASES, THE AVERAGE COST OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY ALSO INCREASES AS THESE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL COST

ESTIMATES. THIS HAS THE EFFECT OF DECREASING THE GROSS MARGIN AND RELATED EARNINGS PROVIDED OTHER FACTORS DO NOT CHANGE.

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR

EACH PROGRAM MAY INCLUDE UNITS THAT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED, UNDELIVERED UNITS UNDER CONTRACT, AND UNITS ANTICIPATED TO BE UNDER CONTRACT IN THE REASONABLE FUTURE (ANTICIPATED ORDERS). IN DEVELOPING TOTAL PROGRAM ESTIMATES, ALL OF THESE ITEMS WITHIN THE

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY MUST BE CONSIDERED.

A FINAL DETERMINATION OF THE INITIAL ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 787 PROGRAM WILL BE MADE IN THE QUARTER OF FIRST AIRPLANE DELIVERY, TARGETED FOR THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011.

737 PROGRAM

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 737 PROGRAM INCREASED BY 400 UNITS DURING 2010. DURING 2010, WE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO

INCREASE MONTHLY PRODUCTION OF THE 737 FROM 31.5 TO 35 AIRPLANES PER MONTH BEGINNING IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2012 AND A FURTHER INCREASE TO 38 AIRPLANES PER MONTH BEGINNING IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2013.

747 PROGRAM

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 747 PROGRAM INCREASED BY 25 UNITS DURING 2010. DURING 2009 AND 2008, WE RECORDED CHARGES OF $1,352 MILLION AND

$685 MILLION TO RECOGNIZE REACH-FORWARD LOSSES ON THE 747 PROGRAM REFLECTING HIGHER THAN ANTICIPATED COSTS, A REDUCTION IN DELIVERY PRICE INCREASES ASSOCIATED WITH ESCALATION AND DIFFICULT CARGO MARKET CONDITIONS WHICH CAUSED US TO DEFER A PLANNED

PRODUCTION RATE INCREASE FOR 747-8. FIRST FLIGHT OF THE 747-8 FREIGHTER OCCURRED ON FEBRUARY 8, 2010. A FOURTH AIRCRAFT WAS ADDED TO THE FLIGHT TEST PROGRAM IN JULY 2010 TO IMPROVE FLIGHT TEST EFFICIENCY. ON SEPTEMBER 30, 2010, WE

ANNOUNCED THAT THE EXPECTED FIRST DELIVERY OF THE 747-8 FREIGHTER WOULD MOVE TO THE MIDDLE OF 2011 FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 AND A FIFTH AIRPLANE WOULD BE ADDED TO THE FLIGHT TEST FLEET TO SUPPORT THE NEW SCHEDULE. THE NEW DELIVERY SCHEDULE

FOLLOWED AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EXPECTED CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF FLIGHT TEST DISCOVERIES, WHICH INCLUDE A LOW FREQUENCY VIBRATION IN CERTAIN FLIGHT CONDITIONS AND AN UNDERPERFORMING AILERON ACTUATOR. WHILE NEITHER ISSUE REQUIRED STRUCTURAL CHANGES TO THE

AIRPLANE, THEY LED TO DISRUPTIONS TO CERTIFICATION TESTING, WHICH THE PROGRAM WAS UNABLE TO OFFSET WITHIN THE PRIOR SCHEDULE. WE ARE CURRENTLY PRODUCING 747-8 AIRPLANES AND UNTIL COMPLETION OF OUR FLIGHT TEST PROGRAM, THERE IS RISK THAT ADDITIONAL

ITEMS MAY BE IDENTIFIED THAT REQUIRE FURTHER MODIFICATIONS OR OTHER CHANGES TO THOSE AIRCRAFT WE HAVE PRODUCED. ON MARCH 19, 2010, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WILL ACCELERATE, FROM MID-2013 TO MID-2012, A PLANNED PRODUCTION RATE INCREASE FROM 1.5 TO 2

AIRPLANES PER MONTH. CERTIFICATION AND FIRST DELIVERY OF THE INTERCONTINENTAL PASSENGER DERIVATIVE IS EXPECTED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2011. SCHEDULE AND OTHER RISKS INHERENT IN THE DEMANDING FLIGHT TEST AND CERTIFICATION PHASES OF PROGRAM

DEVELOPMENT REMAIN.

767 PROGRAM

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 767 PROGRAM INCREASED BY 13 UNITS DURING 2010.

777 PROGRAM

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE 777 PROGRAM INCREASED BY 50 UNITS DURING 2010. IN APRIL 2009, WE ANNOUNCED THAT MONTHLY PRODUCTION OF THE 777

WILL DECLINE FROM 7 TO 5 AIRPLANES PER MONTH

26

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BEGINNING IN JUNE 2010. IN MARCH 2010, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE WILL ACCELERATE BY APPROXIMATELY SIX MONTHS, FROM EARLY 2012 TO MID-2011, A PLANNED PRODUCTION RATE INCREASE TO 7 AIRPLANES PER MONTH.

IN DECEMBER 2010, WE ANNOUNCED THAT MONTHLY PRODUCTION OF THE 777 WILL INCREASE FROM 7 TO 8.3 AIRPLANES PER MONTH IN THE FIRST QUARTER 2013.

787

PROGRAM

FIRST FLIGHT OF THE 787 OCCURRED ON DECEMBER 15, 2009 AND FLIGHT TESTING FOR CERTIFICATION CONTINUED DURING 2010. FLIGHT TESTING INVOLVES SIX FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT AND A LIMITED AMOUNT OF TESTING ON TWO PRODUCTION-CONFIGURED

AIRPLANES PRIOR TO FIRST DELIVERY. ON AUGUST 27, 2010, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE EXPECTED DATE OF FIRST DELIVERY OF THE 787 HAD BEEN MOVED TO MID-FIRST QUARTER 2011 FROM THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010. THIS SCHEDULE REVISION FOLLOWED AN ASSESSMENT OF

THE CUMULATIVE IMPACT OF A NUMBER OF ISSUES, INCLUDING SUPPLIER WORKMANSHIP ISSUES RELATED TO THE HORIZONTAL STABILIZER, INSTRUMENTATION DELAYS AND THE EXPECTED AVAILABILITY DATE OF AN ENGINE NEEDED TO SUPPORT THE FINAL PHASES OF FLIGHT TEST. ON

NOVEMBER 9, 2010, A FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT LOST PRIMARY ELECTRICAL POWER AS A RESULT OF AN ONBOARD FIRE. BACK-UP SYSTEMS FUNCTIONED AS EXPECTED ALLOWING THE CREW TO COMPLETE A SAFE LANDING. FLIGHT TESTING WAS SUSPENDED PENDING INVESTIGATION. ON

NOVEMBER 24, 2010, WE ANNOUNCED MINOR DESIGN CHANGES TO POWER DISTRIBUTION PANELS AND UPDATES TO SYSTEMS SOFTWARE RESULTING FROM THE INVESTIGATION. ON DECEMBER 23, 2010, WE RESUMED BOEING FLIGHT TEST ACTIVITIES AND ON JANUARY 17, 2011

RESUMED CERTIFICATION TESTING. ON JANUARY 18, 2011, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE EXPECTED DATE OF FIRST DELIVERY HAD BEEN MOVED TO THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2011 DUE TO THE FLIGHT TESTING AND CERTIFICATION DELAYS.

A NUMBER OF ENGINEERING AND OTHER DESIGN CHANGES HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE FLIGHT TEST PROGRAM THAT ARE BEING INCORPORATED INTO OUR PRODUCTION

SYSTEM AND ON AIRCRAFT ALREADY COMPLETED. DURING 2010, WE CONTINUED TO PRODUCE 787 AIRPLANES AND UNTIL COMPLETION OF OUR FLIGHT TEST PROGRAM, THERE IS RISK THAT ADDITIONAL ITEMS WILL BE IDENTIFIED THAT REQUIRE FURTHER MODIFICATIONS OR OTHER CHANGES

TO THOSE AIRCRAFT WE HAVE PRODUCED.

WE CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND ADDRESS CHALLENGES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSEMBLY OF INITIAL AIRPLANES INCLUDING MANAGEMENT OF

OUR EXTENDED GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN, INCORPORATION OF DESIGN CHANGES INTO AIRCRAFT IN VARIOUS STAGES OF ASSEMBLY, COMPLETION AND INTEGRATION OF TRAVELED WORK AS WELL AS WEIGHT AND SYSTEMS INTEGRATION. FOR EXAMPLE, DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010 WE

DELAYED SOME 787 COMPONENT DELIVERIES TO REDUCE OUT OF SEQUENCE WORK MOVING INTO FINAL ASSEMBLY AT OUR EVERETT FACTORY AND IMPROVE SUPPLY CHAIN EFFICIENCY.

WE CONTINUE TO WORK TOWARD PLANNED INCREASES IN 787 PRODUCTION RATES AS WELL AS THE TIMELY INTRODUCTION OF THE 787-9 DERIVATIVE. SUCH EFFORTS INCLUDE THE CONSTRUCTION OF A SECOND ASSEMBLY LINE IN NORTH CHARLESTON,

SOUTH CAROLINA AND ESTABLISHING TRANSITIONAL SURGE CAPACITY AT OUR EVERETT, WASHINGTON LOCATION. ON JULY 1, 2010, WE COMPLETED FIRM CONFIGURATION OF THE 787-9 AIRPLANE WITH FIRST DELIVERY SCHEDULED FOR LATE 2013.

WE CONTINUE TO WORK WITH OUR CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS TO ASSESS THE SPECIFIC IMPACTS OF SCHEDULE CHANGES, INCLUDING DELIVERY DELAYS AND SUPPLIER ASSERTIONS. EFFORTS

CONTINUE TO ENSURE WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON SATISFYING CUSTOMER MISSION AND PERFORMANCE NEEDS IN LIGHT OF THE ANTICIPATED WEIGHT OF THEIR RESPECTIVE AIRCRAFT. A NUMBER OF OUR CUSTOMERS HAVE CONTRACTUAL REMEDIES FOR SCHEDULE DELAYS AND/OR PERFORMANCE. WE

CONTINUE TO ADDRESS CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER CLAIMS AND REQUESTS FOR OTHER CONTRACTUAL RELIEF AS BROUGHT FORTH.

DURING 2009, WE CONCLUDED THAT THE FIRST

THREE FLIGHT-TEST 787 AIRCRAFT COULD NOT BE SOLD AS PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED DUE TO THE INORDINATE AMOUNT OF REWORK AND UNIQUE AND EXTENSIVE MODIFICATIONS MADE TO THOSE AIRCRAFT. AS A RESULT, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE AIRCRAFT WERE INCLUDED IN

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. WE BELIEVE THAT THE OTHER THREE 787 FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT ARE COMMERCIALLY SALEABLE AND WE CONTINUE TO INCLUDE COSTS RELATED TO THOSE AIRCRAFT IN PROGRAM INVENTORY AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. IF WE DETERMINE THAT ONE

OR MORE OF THE OTHER FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT CANNOT BE SOLD, WE MAY INCUR ADDITIONAL CHARGES.

27

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR CURRENT ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE PROGRAM IS NOT IN A REACH-FORWARD LOSS POSITION, HOWEVER THE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS OF

THE PRODUCTION CHALLENGES, SCHEDULE DELAYS AND CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER IMPACTS HAVE CREATED SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON PROGRAM PROFITABILITY AND WE EXPECT TO RECORD ZERO MARGIN ON OUR INITIAL DELIVERIES. WE CONTINUE TO IMPLEMENT MITIGATION PLANS AND

COST-REDUCTION EFFORTS TO ADDRESS THIS PRESSURE.

FLEET SUPPORT

WE PROVIDE THE OPERATORS OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES WITH ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES

TO FACILITATE EFFICIENT AND SAFE AIRCRAFT OPERATION. COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS FLEET SUPPORT SERVICES, THESE ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES BEGIN PRIOR TO AIRCRAFT DELIVERY AND CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE OPERATIONAL LIFE OF THE AIRCRAFT. THEY INCLUDE FLIGHT AND

MAINTENANCE TRAINING, FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT COSTS, ENGINEERING SERVICES AND TECHNICAL DATA AND DOCUMENTS. THE COSTS FOR FLEET SUPPORT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AND HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY LESS THAN 1.5% OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED COSTS OF PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. THESE COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE WITH 787 AND 747-8 ENTRY INTO SERVICE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE FOLLOWING CHART SUMMARIZES

THE TIME HORIZON BETWEEN GO-AHEAD AND PLANNED CERTIFICATION/INITIAL DELIVERY FOR MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES DERIVATIVES AND PROGRAMS.

OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE DECREASED BY $2,408 MILLION IN 2010. THIS WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE RECLASSIFICATION TO RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE OF $2,693 MILLION OF PRODUCTION COSTS RELATED TO THE THREE 787 FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT IN 2009, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $285 MILLION INCREASE OF OTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE.

OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE INCREASED BY $2,545 MILLION IN 2009. THIS WAS DUE TO THE 2009 RECLASSIFICATION OF PRODUCTION COSTS RELATED TO THE THREE 787

FLIGHT TEST AIRCRAFT AND $50 MILLION OF LOWER SUPPLIER DEVELOPMENT COST SHARING PAYMENTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $198 MILLION DECREASE OF OTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

THE 787 AND 747-8 PROGRAMS HIGHLIGHT THE RISKS INHERENT IN NEW AIRPLANE PROGRAMS AND

NEW DERIVATIVE AIRPLANES, PARTICULARLY AS BOTH THE 747-8 FREIGHTER AND THE 787-8 CONTINUE THE DEMANDING FLIGHT TEST AND CERTIFICATION PHASES OF PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. DEVELOPMENT ALSO CONTINUES ON THE 787-9 AND 747-8 INTERCONTINENTAL. COSTS RELATED TO

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PROGRAMS AND DERIVATIVE AIRPLANES ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. COSTS TO PRODUCE NEW AIRCRAFT ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORY AND ACCOUNTED FOR USING PROGRAM ACCOUNTING. AIRPLANE PROGRAMS HAVE RISK FOR REACH-FORWARD LOSSES IF OUR ESTIMATED

PRODUCTION COSTS EXCEED OUR ESTIMATED PROGRAM REVENUES FOR THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. GENERALLY COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES ARE SOLD ON A FIRM FIXED-PRICE BASIS WITH AN INDEXED PRICE ESCALATION CLAUSE AND ARE OFTEN SOLD SEVERAL YEARS BEFORE SCHEDULED

DELIVERY. EACH CUSTOMER PURCHASE AGREEMENT CONTAINS AN ESCALATION CLAUSE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EFFECTS OF ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS OVER THE PERIOD OF TIME FROM AIRPLANE SALE TO AIRPLANE DELIVERY. A PRICE ESCALATION FORMULA BASED ON PRE-DEFINED FACTORS IS

USED TO DETERMINE THE FINAL PRICE OF

28

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE AIRPLANE AT THE TIME OF CUSTOMER DELIVERY. WHILE FIRM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS ALLOW US TO BENEFIT FROM COST SAVINGS, THEY ALSO EXPOSE US TO THE RISK OF COST OVERRUNS. MANY NEW AIRPLANES AND

DERIVATIVES HAVE HIGHLY COMPLEX DESIGNS, UTILIZE EXOTIC MATERIALS AND REQUIRE EXTENSIVE COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION WITH SUPPLIER PARTNERS. AS TECHNICAL OR QUALITY ISSUES ARISE, SUCH AS ISSUES EXPERIENCED ON THE 787 AND 747-8 PROGRAMS, WE MAY

EXPERIENCE SCHEDULE DELAYS AND HIGHER COSTS TO COMPLETE NEW PROGRAMS AND DERIVATIVE AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, PRICE ESCALATION FACTORS MAY ALSO IMPACT MARGINS BY REDUCING THE ESTIMATED PRICE OF AIRPLANES DELIVERED IN THE FUTURE. THERE ARE OTHER

FACTORS THAT COULD ALSO RESULT IN LOWER MARGINS OR A MATERIAL CHARGE IF A PROGRAM HAS OR IS DETERMINED TO HAVE REACH-FORWARD LOSSES. THESE INCLUDE: CHANGES TO THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, CUSTOMER AND MODEL MIX, PRODUCTION COSTS AND RATES,

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES AND OTHER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH INCREASING OR ADDING NEW PRODUCTION CAPACITY, LEARNING CURVE, ANTICIPATED COST REDUCTIONS, FLIGHT TEST AND CERTIFICATION SCHEDULES, COSTS, SCHEDULE AND DEMAND FOR DERIVATIVE AIRPLANES AND STATUS

OF CUSTOMER CLAIMS, SUPPLIER ASSERTIONS AND OTHER CONTRACTUAL NEGOTIATIONS. WHILE WE BELIEVE THE COST AND REVENUE ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE, THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF THESE PROGRAMS CREATES FINANCIAL RISK

AS ADDITIONAL COMPLETION COSTS MAY BECOME NECESSARY OR SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES COULD BE EXTENDED, WHICH COULD TRIGGER TERMINATION PROVISIONS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS OR OTHER FINANCIALLY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE.

BOEING DEFENSE, SPACE & SECURITY

BUSINESS

ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

U.S. DEFENSE ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

THE U.S. CONTINUES TO BALANCE FUNDING PRIORITIES TO PLAN FOR THE BROADEST POSSIBLE

RANGE OF OPERATIONS THAT INCLUDE HOMELAND DEFENSE, NATURAL DISASTERS, STABILIZATION EFFORTS, COUNTERINSURGENCY AND COUNTERTERRORISM OPERATIONS, OR NATION STATE AGGRESSORS WITH GROWING SOPHISTICATION AND MILITARY MEANS. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE

(U.S. DOD) FACES THE SIMULTANEOUS REQUIREMENTS TO EXECUTE THE NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY, RECAPITALIZE IMPORTANT CAPABILITIES, AND TRANSFORM THE FORCE TO MEET THE CHANGING NATIONAL SECURITY THREAT ENVIRONMENT AS ARTICULATED IN THE 2010 NATIONAL

SECURITY STRATEGY AND QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW. THESE ACTIONS MUST BE CARRIED OUT AGAINST A BACKDROP OF SIGNIFICANT COMPETING NATIONAL PRIORITIES INCLUDING THE ECONOMIC CRISIS, THE NATIONAL DEBT AND HEALTHCARE REFORM. AS A RESULT, THE TRADITIONAL

ROLES OF DEFENSE AND SECURITY ARE CONVERGING INTO A SINGLE SET OF CUSTOMER NEEDS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE NATIONAL SECURITY ENVIRONMENT WILL REMAIN DYNAMIC AND CHALLENGING WELL INTO THIS DECADE TRENDING WITH THE THREAT ENVIRONMENT.

U.S. GOVERNMENT POLICIES IMPACTING THE DEFENSE ENVIRONMENT INCLUDE: EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES TO SAVE AT LEAST $100 BILLION THROUGH 2016, DEFENSE ACQUISITION REFORM,

INCREASED INSOURCING, CONCERNS OVER THE DECLINE OF THE U.S. INDUSTRIAL BASE, A SHIFT IN EMPHASIS TOWARDS MORE AFFORDABLE SOLUTIONS, AND EMPHASIS ON INCREASING DIPLOMATIC EFFORTS TO EXPAND AND STRENGTHEN OUR ALLIANCES. IN JANUARY 2011, THE U.S. DOD

ANNOUNCED ITS INTENTION TO FURTHER REDUCE ITS TOP-LINE BASE BUDGET BY $78 BILLION OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS.

ALTHOUGH THE U.S. DOD BUDGET HAS GROWN

SUBSTANTIALLY OVER THE PAST DECADE, WE EXPECT THE TOTAL BUDGET GROWTH RATE TO LEVEL OFF OR EVEN DECLINE SLIGHTLY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS DUE TO THESE SHIFTING PRIORITIES AND BUDGET PRESSURES. THE FISCAL YEAR 2011 DISCRETIONARY BUDGET OF $708

BILLION INCLUDES AN OVERSEAS CONTINGENCY OPERATIONS (OCO) BUDGET OF $159 BILLION. PROCUREMENT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE, WHILE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO DECREASE DUE TO GROWING REQUIREMENTS FROM OPERATIONS AND MAINTENANCE

(O&M) AND PERSONNEL COSTS TIED TO U.S. COMMITMENTS OVERSEAS. HOWEVER, THIS TREND IS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY EQUIPMENT RECAPITALIZATION EFFORTS AND CONTINUED DEMAND FOR SYSTEMS DEVELOPMENT. THE NEAR-TERM FORECAST OF THE DEFENSE BUDGET ENVIRONMENT

SHOWS LIMITED GROWTH IN THE 2012 TO 2016 PERIOD FOR INVESTMENT EFFORTS. ALTHOUGH OPPORTUNITIES MAY EXIST FOLLOWING COMPLETE U.S. TROOP DRAW-DOWNS IN IRAQ IN LATE 2011, THEY MAY BE OFFSET BY SUSTAINED O&M REQUIREMENTS IN AFGHANISTAN. EARLY

INDICATIONS SUGGEST THAT COALITION FORCES WILL SUSTAIN OPERATIONS IN THE AFGHANISTAN THEATER LONGER THAN INITIALLY ANTICIPATED. WE CONTINUE TO SEE PRESSURE TO REDUCE OCO REQUESTS THAT HAVE BEEN USED TO COVER THE ONGOING COSTS OF THE WARS.

29

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IT IS UNLIKELY THAT THE U.S. DOD WILL BE ABLE TO FULLY FUND ALL PROGRAMS OF RECORD ALREADY IN DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS

NEW INITIATIVES. THIS IMBALANCE BETWEEN FUTURE COSTS OF PROGRAMS AND EXPECTED FUNDING LEVELS IS NOT UNCOMMON IN THE U.S. DOD AND IS ROUTINELY MANAGED BY INTERNALLY ADJUSTING PRIORITIES AND SCHEDULES, RESTRUCTURING PROGRAMS, AND LENGTHENING

PRODUCTION RUNS TO MEET THE CONSTRAINTS OF AVAILABLE FUNDING AND OCCASIONALLY BY CANCELLATION OF PROGRAMS. WE EXPECT THE U.S. DOD WILL RESPOND TO FUTURE BUDGET CONSTRAINTS BY FOCUSING ON AFFORDABILITY STRATEGIES FROM ACQUISITION EFFICIENCIES AND

REFORMS AND EMPHASIZING UTILIZATION OF COMMERCIAL OFF-THE-SHELF SOLUTIONS AND NETWORK-ENABLED OPERATIONS. THESE STRATEGIES WILL BE ENABLED THROUGH PERSISTENT INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE (ISR), LONG-RANGE STRIKE, SPECIAL

OPERATIONS, UNMANNED SYSTEMS, CYBERSECURITY, PRECISION-GUIDED KINETIC AND NON-KINETIC WEAPONS, ELECTRONIC WARFARE, AS WELL AS SELECTED OUTSOURCING OF LOGISTICS AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES TO IMPROVE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS WHILE MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER

COSTS.

INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

THE INTERNATIONAL MARKET CONTINUES TO BE DRIVEN BY RAPIDLY EVOLVING SECURITY CHALLENGES AND

COUNTRIES NEED TO MODERNIZE AGING INVENTORIES. WESTERN GOVERNMENTS ARE PRESSURED BY NEW THREATS TO SECURITY WHILE AT THE SAME TIME DEALING WITH CONSTRAINED BUDGETS. IN EUROPE, GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ARE CREATING DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON BUDGET

RESOURCES AND AUSTERITY MEASURES HAVE BEEN PUT IN PLACE TO REDUCE DEFENSE SPENDING IN THE NEAR TERM.

THE STRONGEST OPPORTUNITIES FOR 2011 GROWTH OF THE

BDS PORTFOLIO WILL BE IN THE MIDDLE EAST AND ASIA-PACIFIC REGIONS WHERE MODERNIZATION BUDGETS REMAIN RELATIVELY STABLE. WITH INCREASING NEEDS AND AGING EQUIPMENT, THESE REGIONS HAVE THE FINANCIAL STRENGTH NECESSARY TO MAKE FUTURE DEFENSE PURCHASES.

BOEING'S PORTFOLIO OF DEFENSE, SPACE AND SECURITY SOLUTIONS OFFERS PROVEN CAPABILITY, PREDICTABLE PRICE, AND NEAR-TERM AVAILABILITY THAT ARE WELL MATCHED TO THIS CHALLENGING INTERNATIONAL ENVIRONMENT.

ADJACENT MARKET ENVIRONMENT OVERVIEW

WE ARE REPOSITIONING OUR BUSINESS TO EXPAND OUR CAPABILITIES AND ACCELERATE GROWTH IN THE FOLLOWING TARGETED

ADJACENCIES: UNMANNED SYSTEMS; CYBER AND INFORMATION SERVICES; SECURITY; COMMAND, CONTROL, COMMUNICATIONS, COMPUTERS, INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE, AND RECONNAISSANCE (C4ISR); AND LOGISTICS COMMAND AND CONTROL (LOGC2) AND ENERGY SERVICES.

WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUED GROWTH IN UNMANNED SYSTEMS AS THESE PRODUCTS PROVIDE CRITICAL MISSION FUNCTIONS TO THE WARFIGHTER WITH A FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY,

PERSISTENCE, AND ACCURACY. THE DEMAND FOR DEFENSIVE, OFFENSIVE, AND EXPLOIT OPERATIONS IN THE EMERGING CYBER MARKET PROVIDES UNIQUE GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES AS EXPLICIT NEEDS ARE FURTHER DEFINED BY CUSTOMERS. KEY GROWTH AREAS IN SECURITY INCLUDE

AVIATION SECURITY, BORDER SECURITY, MARITIME SECURITY AND CYBERSECURITY AS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT LOOKS TO WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH STATE AND LOCAL INSTITUTIONS. THE DEPENDENCE ON TIME-CRITICAL INFORMATION FOR INTELLIGENCE-BASED OPERATIONS HAS FUELED THE

NEED FOR C4ISR TECHNOLOGIES THAT LOCATE, IDENTIFY, AND TRACK ELUSIVE AND EPHEMERAL TARGETS. WE CONTINUE TO FIND OPPORTUNITY IN THE LOGC2 MARKET IN AREAS INCLUDING LOGISTICS OPERATIONS, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, AND LOGISTICS TRAINING AND SIMULATIONS.

LASTLY, AS ENERGY VOLATILITY INCREASES AND PRESSURE IS PLACED ON THE NATIONAL GRID INFRASTRUCTURE, WE EXPECT THAT THE NEED FOR ENERGY SERVICES SUCH AS ENERGY MANAGEMENT, INFRASTRUCTURE SECURITY, AND SCENARIO MODELING WILL INCREASE ACCORDINGLY.

SINCE OUR OPERATING CYCLE IS LONG-TERM AND INVOLVES MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION CONTRACTS WITH VARYING DELIVERY

AND MILESTONE SCHEDULES, THE OPERATING RESULTS OF A PARTICULAR YEAR, OR YEAR-TO-YEAR COMPARISONS OF REVENUES AND EARNINGS, MAY NOT BE INDICATIVE OF FUTURE OPERATING RESULTS. IN ADDITION, DEPENDING ON THE CUSTOMER AND THEIR FUNDING SOURCES, OUR

ORDERS MIGHT BE STRUCTURED AS ANNUAL FOLLOW-ON CONTRACTS, OR AS ONE LARGE MULTI-YEAR ORDER OR LONG-TERM AWARD. AS A RESULT, PERIOD-TO-PERIOD COMPARISONS OF BACKLOG ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF FUTURE WORKLOADS. THE FOLLOWING DISCUSSIONS OF

COMPARATIVE RESULTS AMONG PERIODS SHOULD BE VIEWED IN THIS CONTEXT.

REVENUES

BDS REVENUES DECREASED BY $1,718 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009,

DUE TO LOWER REVENUES IN ALL THREE SEGMENTS, WITH THE LARGEST DECREASE IN THE N&SS SEGMENT. BDS REVENUES INCREASED BY $1,614 MILLION IN 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008, DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES IN GS&S AND BMA, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN

N&SS.

OPERATING EARNINGS

BDS OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2010 DECREASED BY $424 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER MARGINS IN THE

BMA SEGMENT AND LOWER REVENUES IN THE N&SS SEGMENT. BDS OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2009 INCREASED BY $67 MILLION COMPARED WITH 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EARNINGS IN THE BMA SEGMENT, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER EARNINGS IN THE N&SS SEGMENT.

BACKLOG

TOTAL BACKLOG IS COMPRISED OF CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG, WHICH REPRESENTS WORK WE ARE ON CONTRACT TO PERFORM FOR WHICH WE HAVE RECEIVED

FUNDING, AND UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG, WHICH REPRESENTS WORK WE ARE ON CONTRACT TO PERFORM FOR WHICH FUNDING HAS NOT YET BEEN AUTHORIZED AND APPROPRIATED. BDS TOTAL BACKLOG INCREASED BY LESS THAN 1% IN 2010, FROM $64,839 MILLION TO $65,186 MILLION,

PRIMARILY DUE TO MULTI-YEAR PROCUREMENT CONTRACT AWARDS ON THE F/A-18 AND INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION PROGRAMS, TWO COMMERCIAL SATELLITE CONTRACT AWARDS, AND THE UK FUTURE LOGISTICS INFORMATION SERVICES (FLIS) CONTRACT AWARD, OFFSET BY CURRENT YEAR

DELIVERIES AND SALES ON MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS AWARDED IN PRIOR YEARS. FOR FURTHER DETAILS ON THE CHANGES BETWEEN PERIODS, REFER TO THE DISCUSSIONS OF THE INDIVIDUAL SEGMENTS BELOW.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

OUR BUSINESS INCLUDES A VARIETY OF DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WHICH HAVE COMPLEX DESIGN

AND TECHNICAL CHALLENGES. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE COST-TYPE CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENTS. IN THESE CASES THE ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL RISKS ARE PRIMARILY IN LOWER PROFIT RATES OR PROGRAM CANCELLATION IF MILESTONES AND TECHNICAL PROGRESS ARE NOT

ACCOMPLISHED. EXAMPLES OF THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE FAMILY OF BEYOND LINE-OF-SIGHT TERMINALS, BCTM, GMD, JOINT TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEM, P-8A POSEIDON AND PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS.

SOME OF OUR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS ARE CONTRACTED ON A FIXED-PRICE BASIS. MANY OF THESE PROGRAMS HAVE HIGHLY COMPLEX DESIGNS. AS TECHNICAL OR QUALITY ISSUES ARISE, WE MAY EXPERIENCE SCHEDULE DELAYS

AND COST IMPACTS, WHICH COULD INCREASE OUR ESTIMATED COST TO PERFORM THE WORK OR REDUCE OUR ESTIMATED PRICE, EITHER OF WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHARGE. THESE PROGRAMS ARE ONGOING, AND

WHILE WE BELIEVE THE COST AND FEE ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE, THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF THESE PROGRAMS CREATES FINANCIAL RISK AS ADDITIONAL COMPLETION COSTS MAY BECOME NECESSARY OR SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES

COULD BE EXTENDED, WHICH COULD TRIGGER TERMINATION PROVISIONS, THE LOSS OF SATELLITE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS, OR OTHER FINANCIALLY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE. THESE PROGRAMS HAVE RISK FOR REACH-FORWARD LOSSES IF OUR ESTIMATED COSTS EXCEED OUR

ESTIMATED CONTRACT REVENUES. EXAMPLES OF OUR FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS INCLUDE AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING AND CONTROL (AEW&C), P-8I, KC-767 INTERNATIONAL TANKER, AND COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY SATELLITES.

BMA REVENUES DECREASED BY LESS THAN 1% IN 2010 AND INCREASED BY 6% IN 2009. LOWER REVENUES IN 2010 ON THE C-17, APACHE

AND T-45 PROGRAMS WERE NEARLY OFFSET BY HIGHER CHINOOK, F/A-18 AND AEW&C REVENUES. THE INCREASE OF $859 MILLION IN 2009 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER REVENUES ON THE APACHE, V-22, CHINOOK, F/A-18, AND PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS, PARTLY OFFSET BY LOWER

REVENUES ON THE F-22 AND SEVERAL WEAPONS PROGRAMS.

OPERATING EARNINGS

BMA EARNINGS DECREASED BY $270 MILLION IN 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER DELIVERIES OF C-17 AIRCRAFT AND LESS

FAVORABLE PRICING AND MIX ON THE C-17 PROGRAM. BMA OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED BY $234 MILLION IN 2009 PARTLY DUE TO HIGHER DELIVERIES ON SEVERAL PROGRAMS AND VOLUME, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A CHANGE IN DELIVERY MIX. OPERATING EARNINGS IN BOTH YEARS

WERE NEGATIVELY IMPACTED BY CHARGES RECORDED ON THE AEW&C AND KC-767 INTERNATIONAL TANKER PROGRAMS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE BMA SEGMENT CONTINUES TO FOCUS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO LEVERAGE

CUSTOMER KNOWLEDGE, TECHNICAL EXPERTISE AND SYSTEM INTEGRATION OF MANNED AND UNMANNED SYSTEMS THAT PROVIDE INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO MEET THE WARFIGHTERS ENDURING NEEDS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE REMAINED FLAT IN 2010 BUT IN 2009

INCREASED BY 20% OVER 2008 PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED PROTOTYPING ACTIVITIES WHICH WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER INTERNATIONAL TANKER DEVELOPMENT COSTS. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES UTILIZE OUR CAPABILITIES IN ARCHITECTURES,

SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND WEAPON SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES TO DEVELOP SOLUTIONS WHICH ARE DESIGNED TO BETTER PREPARE US TO MEET CUSTOMERS NEEDS IN U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL GROWTH AREAS SUCH AS: MILITARY-COMMERCIAL DERIVATIVES, ROTORCRAFT,

GLOBAL STRIKE, MISSILES AND UNMANNED AIRBORNE SYSTEMS, AND SURVEILLANCE AND ENGAGEMENT SYSTEMS. THE PRODUCTS OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT SUPPORT BOTH NEW MANNED AND UNMANNED SYSTEMS AS WELL AS ENHANCED VERSIONS OF EXISTING FIELDED PRODUCTS.

INVESTMENTS SUPPORT VERTICAL INTEGRATION OF OUR PRODUCT LINE IN AREAS SUCH AS AUTONOMOUS OPERATION OF UNMANNED SYSTEMS, ADVANCED SENSORS AND ELECTRONIC WARFARE. THESE EFFORTS FOCUS ON INCREASING MISSION EFFECTIVENESS, INTEROPERABILITY, RELIABILITY

AND REDUCING THE COST OF OWNERSHIP.

BACKLOG

BMA TOTAL BACKLOG IN 2010 DECREASED 6% FROM 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO DELIVERIES AND SALES ON

MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS AWARDED IN PRIOR YEARS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A MULTI-YEAR CONTRACT AWARD ON THE F/A-18 PROGRAM. TOTAL BACKLOG IN 2009 WAS VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED FROM 2008. BACKLOG INCREASES DUE TO 2009 ORDERS FOR C-17, P-8I AND CHINOOK AIRCRAFT WERE

OFFSET BY REVENUES RECOGNIZED ON MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS RECEIVED IN PRIOR YEARS WITH THE LARGEST DECREASE IN THE F/A-18 PROGRAM.

ADDITIONAL

CONSIDERATIONS

AEW&C

THE AEW&C DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM, ALSO KNOWN AS WEDGETAIL IN AUSTRALIA, PEACE EAGLE IN TURKEY AND PEACE EYE IN THE

REPUBLIC OF KOREA, CONSISTS OF 737-700 AIRCRAFT OUTFITTED WITH A VARIETY OF COMMAND AND CONTROL AND ADVANCED RADAR SYSTEMS, SOME OF WHICH HAVE NEVER BEEN INSTALLED ON AN AIRPLANE BEFORE. WEDGETAIL INCLUDES SIX AIRCRAFT AND PEACE EAGLE AND PEACE EYE

INCLUDE FOUR AIRCRAFT EACH. DURING 2010, 2009 AND 2008, WE RECORDED CHARGES INCREASING THE REACH-FORWARD LOSSES ON THE AEW&C PROGRAMS IN AUSTRALIA AND TURKEY BY $174 MILLION, $133 MILLION AND $308 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE CHARGES REFLECT

TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TEST PROGRAM, DELIVERY SCHEDULE DELAYS, SUBSYSTEM DEVELOPMENT ISSUES, AND ADDITIONAL TIME FOR INTEGRATION TESTING. DURING 2010, FOUR WEDGETAIL AIRCRAFT WERE DELIVERED TO AUSTRALIA WITH INITIAL

CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE. FINAL CUSTOMER ACCEPTANCE FOR ALL SIX WEDGETAIL AIRCRAFT IS SCHEDULED TO BE COMPLETED BY THE END OF 2011. IN JANUARY 2011, THE PEACE EAGLE PROGRAM BEGAN THE FORMAL TEST PHASE. THESE ARE ADVANCED AND COMPLEX FIXED-PRICE

DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS INVOLVING TECHNICAL CHALLENGES AT THE INDIVIDUAL SUBSYSTEM LEVEL AND IN THE OVERALL INTEGRATION OF THESE SUBSYSTEMS INTO A RELIABLE AND EFFECTIVE OPERATIONAL CAPABILITY. WE BELIEVE THAT THE COST AND REVENUE ESTIMATES

INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE; HOWEVER, THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY OF THE PROGRAMS CREATES FINANCIAL RISK AS ADDITIONAL COMPLETION COSTS MAY BE NECESSARY OR SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES COULD BE DELAYED.

KC-767 INTERNATIONAL TANKER

THE KC-767 INTERNATIONAL TANKER PROGRAM INCLUDES FOUR AIRCRAFT FOR THE ITALIAN AIR FORCE AND FOUR AIRCRAFT FOR THE JAPANESE AIR

SELF DEFENSE FORCE. DURING 2010, 2009 AND 2008, WE RECORDED CHARGES INCREASING THE REACH-FORWARD LOSSES IN THE KC-767 INTERNATIONAL TANKER PROGRAM BY $53 MILLION, $78 MILLION AND $85 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE FINAL DELIVERY TO JAPAN WAS MADE IN

DECEMBER 2009 AND FIRST DELIVERY TO ITALY WAS MADE IN DECEMBER 2010. THE ITALIAN KC-767 TANKER PROGRAM IS ONGOING, AND WHILE WE BELIEVE THE REVENUE AND COST ESTIMATES INCORPORATED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE APPROPRIATE, THE TECHNICAL COMPLEXITY

OF THE PROGRAM CREATES FINANCIAL RISK AS ADDITIONAL COMPLETION AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS MAY BE NECESSARY OR REMAINING SCHEDULED DELIVERY DATES COULD BE DELAYED.

DECREASED BY $195 MILLION IN 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES AND CHARGES RELATED TO THE SEA LAUNCH BANKRUPTCY. EARNINGS IN 2009 WERE ALSO REDUCED BY CHARGES RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF A SATELLITE CONTRACT DISPUTE AND INDEMNIFICATION OF DELTA

II INVENTORY. EARNINGS IN 2008 INCLUDED A FAVORABLE SETTLEMENT ON A CIVIL SATELLITE PROGRAM. N&SS OPERATING EARNINGS INCLUDE EQUITY EARNINGS OF $189 MILLION, $164 MILLION AND $178 MILLION FROM THE UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE JOINT VENTURE AND THE

UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE (ULA) JOINT VENTURE IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE N&SS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT FUNDING REMAINS FOCUSED ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF C4ISR THAT SUPPORT A NETWORK-ENABLED ARCHITECTURE APPROACH FOR OUR CUSTOMERS. WE ARE INVESTING IN CAPABILITIES TO ENHANCE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN EXISTING AND NEW AIR/GROUND AND MARITIME

PLATFORMS, TO INCREASE COMMUNICATIONS AVAILABILITY, UTILITY AND BANDWIDTH THROUGH MORE ROBUST SPACE SYSTEMS, AND TO LEVERAGE INNOVATIVE NETWORKING AND ISR CONCEPTS. INVESTMENTS WERE ALSO MADE TO DEVELOP CONCEPTS AND

CAPABILITIES RELATED TO CYBER AND SECURITY PRODUCTS, AS WELL AS THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEXT-GENERATION SPACE AND INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS. ALONG WITH INCREASED FUNDING TO SUPPORT THESE NETWORK-ENABLED CAPABILITIES, WE ALSO MAINTAINED OUR INVESTMENT

LEVELS IN MISSILE DEFENSE, DIRECTED ENERGY AND ADVANCED EXPLORATION SYSTEMS.

BACKLOG

N&SS TOTAL BACKLOG INCREASED 6% IN 2010 COMPARED WITH

2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO TWO COMMERCIAL SATELLITE CONTRACT AWARDS, A MULTI-YEAR CONTRACT AWARD ON THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION PROGRAM AND GMD CONTRACT AWARDS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY REVENUES RECOGNIZED ON THE BCTM PROGRAM. TOTAL BACKLOG DECREASED BY

34% IN 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008 PARTLY DUE TO THE PARTIAL TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE BY THE U.S. ARMY OF THE BCTM SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND DEMONSTRATION CONTRACT RELATED TO MANNED GROUND VEHICLES AND ASSOCIATED SYSTEMS AND EQUIPMENT. 2009 DELIVERIES

AND SALES ON MULTI-YEAR CONTRACTS AWARDED IN PRIOR YEARS INCLUDING BCTM, GMD, AND PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE BACKLOG REDUCTION.

ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS

UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE

ON DECEMBER 1, 2006, WE AND LOCKHEED MARTIN CORPORATION (LOCKHEED) CREATED A 50/50 JOINT VENTURE NAMED UNITED LAUNCH ALLIANCE L.L.C. ULA COMBINES THE PRODUCTION, ENGINEERING, TEST

AND LAUNCH OPERATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. GOVERNMENT LAUNCHES OF BOEING DELTA AND LOCKHEED ATLAS ROCKETS. WE INITIALLY CONTRIBUTED NET ASSETS OF $914 MILLION AT DECEMBER 1, 2006. THE BOOK VALUE OF OUR INVESTMENT EXCEEDED OUR PROPORTIONATE

SHARE OF ULAS NET ASSETS. THIS DIFFERENCE IS EXPENSED RATABLY IN FUTURE YEARS. BASED ON THE ADJUSTED CONTRIBUTIONS AND THE CONFORMED ACCOUNTING POLICIES ESTABLISHED BY ULA, THIS AMORTIZATION IS EXPECTED TO BE APPROXIMATELY $15 MILLION ANNUALLY

FOR THE NEXT 14 YEARS.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE FORMATION OF ULA, WE AND LOCKHEED EACH COMMITTED TO PROVIDE UP TO $200 MILLION TO SUPPORT ULAS

WORKING CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS THROUGH DECEMBER 1, 2011. WE AND LOCKHEED TRANSFERRED PERFORMANCE RESPONSIBILITY FOR CERTAIN U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS TO ULA AS OF THE CLOSING DATE. WE AND LOCKHEED AGREED TO JOINTLY GUARANTEE THE PERFORMANCE OF

THOSE CONTRACTS TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. WE AND LOCKHEED HAVE ALSO EACH COMMITTED TO PROVIDE ULA WITH UP TO $232 MILLION OF ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS IN THE EVENT ULA DOES NOT HAVE SUFFICIENT FUNDS TO MAKE A REQUIRED

PAYMENT TO US UNDER AN INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT. SEE NOTE 11 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ULA THROUGH

DECEMBER 31, 2020 AGAINST POTENTIAL NON-RECOVERABILITY AND NON-ALLOWABILITY OF $1,360 MILLION OF BOEING DELTA LAUNCH PROGRAM INVENTORY INCLUDED IN CONTRIBUTED ASSETS PLUS $1,860 MILLION OF INVENTORY SUBJECT TO AN INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT

WHICH ENDS ON MARCH 31, 2021. SINCE INCEPTION, ULA HAS CONSUMED $1,201 MILLION OF INVENTORY THAT WAS CONTRIBUTED BY US. ULA HAS MADE ADVANCE PAYMENTS OF $420 MILLION TO US AND WE HAVE RECORDED REVENUES AND COST OF SALES OF $166 MILLION UNDER

THE INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT THROUGH DECEMBER 31, 2010. ULA IS CONTINUING TO ASSESS THE FUTURE OF THE DELTA II PROGRAM BEYOND WHAT IS CURRENTLY ON CONTRACT. IN THE EVENT ULA IS UNABLE TO SELL ADDITIONAL DELTA II INVENTORY, OUR EARNINGS COULD

BE REDUCED BY UP TO $70 MILLION.

WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ULA AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT ULA MAY INCUR IN THE EVENT ULA IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN CERTAIN

ADDITIONAL CONTRACT PRICING FROM THE U.S. AIR FORCE (USAF) FOR FOUR SATELLITE MISSIONS. WE BELIEVE ULA IS ENTITLED TO ADDITIONAL CONTRACT PRICING. IN DECEMBER 2008, ULA SUBMITTED A CLAIM TO THE USAF TO RE-PRICE THE CONTRACT VALUE FOR TWO SATELLITE

MISSIONS. IN MARCH 2009, THE USAF ISSUED A DENIAL OF THAT CLAIM AND IN JUNE 2009, ULA FILED AN APPEAL. DURING 2009, THE USAF EXERCISED ITS OPTION FOR A THIRD SATELLITE MISSION. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, ULA SUBMITTED A CLAIM TO THE USAF TO

RE-PRICE THE CONTRACT VALUE OF THE THIRD MISSION. THE USAF DID NOT EXERCISE AN OPTION FOR A FOURTH MISSION PRIOR TO EXPIRATION. IF ULA IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING ADDITIONAL PRICING, WE MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A PORTION OF THE SHORTFALL AND MAY

RECORD UP TO $283 MILLION IN PRE-TAX LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE THREE MISSIONS, REPRESENTING UP TO $261 MILLION FOR THE INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENT AND UP TO $22 MILLION FOR OUR PORTION OF ADDITIONAL CONTRACT LOSSES INCURRED BY ULA.

OF 17%, IN EACH CASE COMPARED WITH THE PRIOR YEAR. THE 2010 DECREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES ON SEVERAL MAINTENANCE, MODIFICATIONS AND UPGRADES (MM&U) PROGRAMS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER REVENUES ON SEVERAL INTEGRATED LOGISTICS (IL)

PROGRAMS. THE 2009 INCREASE WAS DUE TO INCREASED VOLUME IN THE IL PROGRAMS AND THE TRAINING SYSTEMS AND SERVICES (TS&S) DIVISIONS.

OPERATING EARNINGS

GS&S OPERATING EARNINGS DECREASED BY 3% IN 2010 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES. OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED 3% IN 2009 AS

ADDITIONAL EARNINGS FROM INCREASED VOLUME WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY LOWER MARGINS DUE TO CONTRACT ADJUSTMENTS AND CHANGES IN CONTRACT MIX.

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

GS&S CONTINUES TO FOCUS INVESTMENT STRATEGIES ON ITS CORE BUSINESSES INCLUDING IL, MM&U AND TS&S, AS WELL AS ON MOVING INTO NEW MARKET AREAS OF LOGISTICS COMMAND AND CONTROL (LOG C2) IN ADVANCED SERVICES AND ENERGY

MANAGEMENT IN BOEING ENERGY. INVESTMENTS HAVE BEEN MADE TO CONTINUE THE DEVELOPMENT AND IMPLEMENTATION OF INNOVATIVE TOOLS, PROCESSES AND SYSTEMS AS MARKET DISCRIMINATORS IN THE DELIVERY OF INTEGRATED CUSTOMER SOLUTIONS.

BACKLOG

GS&S TOTAL BACKLOG INCREASED BY 12% IN 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO THE AWARD OF THE UK FLIS CONTRACT. BACKLOG ALSO INCREASED DUE TO

INCREASES IN SEVERAL IL AND MM&U PROGRAMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN SEVERAL TRAINING SYSTEMS PROGRAMS. TOTAL BACKLOG INCREASED BY 8% IN 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008 DUE TO SIGNIFICANT GROWTH IN INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT AND DEFENSE AND GOVERNMENT

SERVICES PROGRAMS AND PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASES IN SEVERAL IL AND MM&U PROGRAMS.

BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

BCCS CUSTOMER

FINANCING AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 TOTALED $4,694 MILLION. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BCCS PORTFOLIO IS CONCENTRATED AMONG CERTAIN U.S. COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS. BCCS PORTFOLIO IS ALSO CONCENTRATED BY VARYING

DEGREES ACROSS BOEING AIRCRAFT PRODUCT TYPES MOST NOTABLY OUT OF PRODUCTION BOEING AIRCRAFT SUCH AS 717 AIRCRAFT.

WE PROVIDED GREATER AMOUNTS OF

FINANCING TO BOEING CUSTOMERS DURING 2009 THAN IN ANY OF THE PRECEDING FIVE YEARS. SOURCES OF FINANCING AVAILABLE FOR AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES IMPROVED DURING 2010 AND AS A RESULT, WE PROVIDED NO FINANCING FOR BOEING AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES.

AIRCRAFT VALUES AND LEASE RATES ARE IMPACTED BY THE NUMBER AND TYPE OF AIRCRAFT THAT ARE CURRENTLY OUT OF SERVICE. APPROXIMATELY 2,200 WESTERN-BUILT COMMERCIAL JET

AIRCRAFT (10.5% OF CURRENT WORLD FLEET) WERE

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PARKED AT THE END OF 2010, INCLUDING BOTH IN-PRODUCTION AND OUT-OF-PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT TYPES. OF THESE PARKED AIRCRAFT, OVER 30% ARE NOT EXPECTED TO RETURN TO SERVICE. AT THE END OF 2009 AND

2008, 11.6% AND 11.0% OF THE WESTERN-BUILT COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT WERE PARKED. AIRCRAFT VALUATIONS COULD DECLINE IF SIGNIFICANT NUMBERS OF ADDITIONAL AIRCRAFT, PARTICULARLY TYPES WITH RELATIVELY FEW OPERATORS, ARE PLACED OUT OF SERVICE.

CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF LEASE INCOME FROM EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASE AND INTEREST FROM FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND NOTES. BCCS REVENUES DECREASED $21 MILLION AND $43 MILLION IN 2010 AND 2009, DUE TO A SMALLER PORTFOLIO OF EQUIPMENT UNDER

OPERATING LEASES AS A RESULT OF AIRCRAFT RETURNS AND LOWER LEASE RATES ON RE-LEASED AIRCRAFT.

EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS

BCCS OPERATING EARNINGS ARE PRESENTED NET OF INTEREST EXPENSE, PROVISION FOR (RECOVERY OF) LOSSES, ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE, DEPRECIATION ON LEASED EQUIPMENT

AND OTHER OPERATING EXPENSES. OPERATING EARNINGS INCREASED BY $26 MILLION IN 2010 COMPARED WITH 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE AND LOWER PROVISION FOR LOSSES. THE IMPACT OF DECLINES IN AIRCRAFT COLLATERAL VALUES RECOGNIZED BY BCC AND

REDUCED PROJECTED CASH FLOWS FOR CERTAIN AIRCRAFT WAS NOT AS SIGNIFICANT IN 2010 AS IT WAS IN 2009. THE DECREASE IN OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2009 COMPARED WITH 2008 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER REVENUES AND HIGHER ASSET IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE AND PROVISION

FOR LOSSES.

BCCS CUSTOMER FINANCING AND INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 DECREASED FROM DECEMBER 31, 2009 DUE TO NORMAL

PORTFOLIO RUN-OFF AND ASSET PRE-PAYMENTS. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, BCC HAD $583 MILLION AND $385 MILLION OF ASSETS THAT WERE HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE, OF WHICH $28 MILLION AND $345 MILLION HAD EITHER EXECUTED TERM SHEETS WITH DEPOSITS OR

FIRM CONTRACTS TO BE SOLD OR PLACED ON LEASE. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO BCCS TERMINATION OF AIRCRAFT LEASES WITH AEVOVIAS CARIBE S.A. DE C.V. (CLICK), AN AFFILIATE OF COMPANIA MEXICANA DE AVIACION S.A. DE C.V. (MEXICANA), IN AUGUST

2010. ADDITIONALLY, AIRCRAFT SUBJECT TO LEASES WITH A CARRYING VALUE OF APPROXIMATELY $174 MILLION ARE SCHEDULED TO BE RETURNED OFF LEASE DURING 2011. THESE AIRCRAFT ARE BEING REMARKETED OR WE ARE SEEKING TO HAVE THE LEASES EXTENDED.

BCC ENTERS INTO CERTAIN TRANSACTIONS WITH THE OTHER SEGMENT IN THE FORM OF INTERCOMPANY GUARANTEES AND OTHER

SUBSIDIES THAT MITIGATE THE EFFECTS OF CERTAIN CREDIT QUALITY OR ASSET IMPAIRMENT ISSUES ON THE BCC SEGMENT.

BANKRUPTCIES

IN AUGUST 2010, MEXICANA FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION IN MEXICO AND THE UNITED STATES. AT THE TIME OF THOSE FILINGS, BCC HAD LEASED AND DELIVERED 19 717 AIRCRAFT

TO CLICK, AND 6 ADDITIONAL 717 AIRCRAFT WERE SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY TO CLICK UNDER EXECUTED LEASES. ON AUGUST 27, 2010, BCC SERVED CLICK A NOTICE OF TERMINATION OF ALL 25 LEASES AS A RESULT OF NON-PAYMENT. ON OR ABOUT AUGUST 28, 2010,

CLICK CEASED FLIGHT OPERATIONS. IN SEPTEMBER 2010, CLICK FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION. BCC HAS RECOVERED ALL OF THE AIRCRAFT THAT HAD BEEN DELIVERED TO CLICK. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, WE RECORDED AN $81 MILLION NET IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RELATED

TO CERTAIN 717 AIRCRAFT LEASED TO CLICK. THIS CHARGE WAS PRIMARILY RECORDED IN THE OTHER SEGMENT DUE TO AN INTERCOMPANY GUARANTEE BETWEEN US AND BCC. ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES COULD BE RECORDED IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RE-LEASE THE AIRCRAFT AT

ANTICIPATED RENTAL RATES.

SOUTHWEST/AIRTRAN MERGER

ON SEPTEMBER 26, 2010, SOUTHWEST AIRLINES CO. (SOUTHWEST) AND AIRTRAN HOLDINGS, INC. (AIRTRAN) ENTERED INTO AN AGREEMENT AND PLAN OF MERGER, WHEREBY SOUTHWEST WILL ACQUIRE, SUBJECT TO CERTAIN CONDITIONS, ALL

OF THE OUTSTANDING COMMON STOCK OF AIRTRAN. AIRTRAN, TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES, REPRESENTS APPROXIMATELY 27% OF OUR GROSS CUSTOMER FINANCING PORTFOLIO CARRYING VALUE, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF 717 AIRCRAFT. AIRTRAN IS THE LARGEST CUSTOMER IN

TERMS OF BCCS SEGMENT REVENUE AND CUSTOMER FINANCING PORTFOLIO CARRYING VALUE.

RESTRUCTURINGS AND RESTRUCTURING REQUESTS

FROM TIME TO TIME, CERTAIN CUSTOMERS HAVE REQUESTED A RESTRUCTURING OF THEIR TRANSACTIONS WITH BCC. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, BCC HAS NOT REACHED AGREEMENT ON

ANY RESTRUCTURING REQUESTS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

NET CASH PROVIDED BY OPERATING ACTIVITIES DECREASED BY $2,651 MILLION TO $2,952 MILLION DURING 2010

COMPARED WITH 2009 PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET WORKING CAPITAL IN 2010, DRIVEN BY GROWTH IN INVENTORY AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD INVENTORIES PRIOR TO THE ANTICIPATED DELIVERY AND PRODUCTION RAMP-UP OF THE 787 AND 747-8 PROGRAMS. WE EXPECT THE 787

INVENTORY GROWTH IN 2011 TO BE SIMILAR TO THE GROWTH EXPERIENCED IN 2010 WHILE WE EXPECT 747-8 INVENTORY TO BEGIN TO DECLINE AS AIRCRAFT ARE DELIVERED.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

CASH USED BY INVESTING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $4,831 MILLION DURING 2010 COMPARED WITH $3,794 MILLION USED DURING 2009, PRIMARILY DUE TO

HIGHER NET CONTRIBUTIONS TO TIME DEPOSITS DURING 2010. IN 2010, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TOTALED $1,125 MILLION DOWN FROM $1,186 MILLION IN 2009. WE EXPECT CAPITAL SPENDING IN 2011 TO BE HIGHER THAN 2010 DUE TO THE ONGOING CONSTRUCTION OF A 787 FINAL

ASSEMBLY LINE IN NORTH CHARLESTON, SOUTH CAROLINA AND HIGHER SPENDING TO SUPPORT COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PRODUCTION RATE INCREASES. EXPENDITURES ON ACQUISITIONS TOTALED $932 MILLION, UP FROM $639 MILLION, LARGELY REFLECTING THE ACQUISITION OF ARGON ST,

INC. FOR $782 MILLION.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

CASH USED BY FINANCING ACTIVITIES TOTALED $1,962 MILLION DURING 2010 COMPARED WITH $4,094 MILLION

DEBT WAS $12,421 MILLION AND $12,924 MILLION, OF WHICH $948 MILLION AND $707 MILLION WERE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM. THIS INCLUDES $3,446 MILLION AND $4,075 MILLION OF DEBT RECORDED AT BCC, OF WHICH $801 MILLION AND $659 MILLION WERE CLASSIFIED AS

SHORT-TERM. IN 2010, WE REPAID $689 MILLION OF DEBT, INCLUDING REPAYMENTS OF $645 MILLION OF DEBT HELD AT BCC.

IN 2010, WE HAD 494,939 SHARES

TRANSFERRED TO US FROM EMPLOYEES FOR TAX WITHHOLDING AND DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES THROUGH OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. DURING 2009 AND 2008, CASH USED IN OUR OPEN MARKET SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM TOTALED $50 MILLION AND $2,937

MILLION. IN 2008, WE ALSO REPURCHASED SHARES FOR $95 MILLION AS PART OF THE SHAREVALUE TRUST DISTRIBUTION.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL

BORROWING CAPACITY. ANY FUTURE BORROWINGS MAY AFFECT OUR CREDIT RATINGS AND ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS DEBT COVENANTS AS DESCRIBED BELOW. WE AND BCC HAVE COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAMS THAT CONTINUE TO SERVE AS SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL SOURCES OF SHORT-TERM

LIQUIDITY. THROUGHOUT 2010 AND AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, NEITHER WE NOR BCC HAD ANY COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS OUTSTANDING. CURRENTLY, WE HAVE $4,376 MILLION ($1,500 MILLION EXCLUSIVELY AVAILABLE FOR BCC) OF UNUSED BORROWING ON REVOLVING CREDIT

LINE AGREEMENTS. WE ANTICIPATE THAT THESE CREDIT LINES WILL PRIMARILY SERVE AS BACKUP LIQUIDITY TO SUPPORT POSSIBLE COMMERCIAL PAPER BORROWINGS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

IN THE EVENT WE REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO SUPPORT STRATEGIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES, OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

FINANCING COMMITMENTS, UNFAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF LITIGATION OR OTHER LOSS CONTINGENCIES, OR OTHER BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS, WE EXPECT TO MEET INCREASED FUNDING REQUIREMENTS BY ISSUING COMMERCIAL PAPER OR TERM DEBT. WE BELIEVE OUR ABILITY TO ACCESS

EXTERNAL CAPITAL RESOURCES SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY EXISTING SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM COMMITMENTS AND PLANS, AND ALSO TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF POTENTIAL STRATEGIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD THEY ARISE

WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR. HOWEVER, THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE OF THE COST OR AVAILABILITY OF FUTURE BORROWINGS, IF ANY, UNDER OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM, IN THE DEBT MARKETS OR OUR CREDIT FACILITIES.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, OUR PENSION PLANS WERE $9,854 MILLION AND $6,356 MILLION UNDERFUNDED AS MEASURED UNDER GAAP. ON AN ERISA BASIS OUR PLANS ARE

MORE THAN 100% FUNDED. IN 2011, WE EXPECT TO MAKE DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PLANS OF APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION. ABSENT INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES AND/OR HIGHER ASSET VALUES, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR

PENSION PLANS IN THE FUTURE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE COVENANTS FOR OUR DEBT AND CREDIT FACILITIES. THE MOST

RESTRICTIVE COVENANTS INCLUDE A LIMITATION ON MORTGAGE DEBT AND SALE AND LEASEBACK TRANSACTIONS AS A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED NET TANGIBLE ASSETS (AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENTS), AND A LIMITATION ON CONSOLIDATED DEBT AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL

CAPITAL (AS DEFINED). WHEN CONSIDERING DEBT COVENANTS, WE CONTINUE TO HAVE SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPACITY.

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

PENSION CASH REQUIREMENTS ARE BASED ON AN ESTIMATE OF OUR

MINIMUM FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, PURSUANT TO ERISA REGULATIONS, ALTHOUGH WE MAY MAKE ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS. ESTIMATES OF OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ARE BASED ON BOTH OUR ESTIMATED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND THE ESTIMATED

CONTRIBUTIONS TO PLANS THAT ARE FUNDED THROUGH TRUSTS.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS REPRESENT CONTRACTUAL AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE

GOODS OR SERVICES THAT ARE LEGALLY BINDING; SPECIFY A FIXED, MINIMUM OR RANGE OF QUANTITIES; SPECIFY A FIXED, MINIMUM, VARIABLE, OR INDEXED PRICE PROVISION; AND SPECIFY APPROXIMATE TIMING OF THE TRANSACTION. PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS INCLUDE AMOUNTS

RECORDED AS WELL AS AMOUNTS THAT ARE NOT RECORDED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. APPROXIMATELY 8% OF THE PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS DISCLOSED ABOVE ARE REIMBURSABLE TO US PURSUANT TO COST-TYPE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS NOT RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION

PRODUCTION RELATED PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS NOT RECORDED ON THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION INCLUDE AGREEMENTS FOR PRODUCTION GOODS, TOOLING COSTS, ELECTRICITY AND NATURAL GAS CONTRACTS, PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT, AND OTHER MISCELLANEOUS PRODUCTION RELATED OBLIGATIONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT

OBLIGATION RELATES TO INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS. WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS THAT SPECIFY DETERMINABLE PRICES AND QUANTITIES, AND LONG-TERM DELIVERY TIMEFRAMES. IN ADDITION, WE PURCHASE RAW

MATERIALS ON BEHALF OF OUR SUPPLIERS. THESE AGREEMENTS REQUIRE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO BE PREPARED TO BUILD AND DELIVER ITEMS IN SUFFICIENT TIME TO MEET OUR PRODUCTION SCHEDULES. THE NEED FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS ARISES FROM

THE EXTENDED PRODUCTION PLANNING HORIZON FOR MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS. A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE INVENTORY COMMITMENTS IS SUPPORTED BY FIRM CONTRACTS AND/OR HAS HISTORICALLY RESULTED IN SETTLEMENT THROUGH REIMBURSEMENT FROM CUSTOMERS FOR PENALTY

PAYMENTS TO THE SUPPLIER SHOULD THE CUSTOMER NOT TAKE DELIVERY. THESE AMOUNTS ARE ALSO INCLUDED IN OUR FORECASTS OF COSTS FOR PROGRAM AND CONTRACT ACCOUNTING. SOME INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS MAY INCLUDE ESCALATION ADJUSTMENTS. IN THESE LIMITED

CASES, WE HAVE INCLUDED OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE EFFECT OF THE ESCALATION ADJUSTMENT IN THE AMOUNTS DISCLOSED IN THE TABLE ABOVE.

OBLIGATIONS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS RECORDED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION PRIMARILY INCLUDE ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND CERTAIN OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDING ACCRUED

INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS

OUTSIDE OF THE U.S. TO FACILITATE ECONOMIC FLOW BACK AND/OR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO THEIR BUSINESSES OR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AS THE RESULT OF THEIR PROCUREMENT OF GOODS AND/OR SERVICES FROM US. THESE COMMITMENTS MAY BE SATISFIED BY OUR PLACEMENT OF

DIRECT WORK OR VENDOR ORDERS FOR SUPPLIES, OPPORTUNITIES TO BID ON SUPPLY CONTRACTS, TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY OR OTHER FORMS OF ASSISTANCE. HOWEVER, IN CERTAIN CASES, OUR COMMITMENTS MAY BE SATISFIED THROUGH OTHER PARTIES (SUCH AS OUR VENDORS) WHO

PURCHASE SUPPLIES FROM OUR NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS. WE DO NOT COMMIT TO INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS UNLESS A CONTRACT FOR SALE OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IS SIGNED. IN CERTAIN CASES, PENALTIES COULD BE IMPOSED IF WE DO NOT MEET OUR INDUSTRIAL

PARTICIPATION COMMITMENTS. DURING 2010, WE INCURRED NO SUCH PENALTIES. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAVE OUTSTANDING INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS TOTALING $9.7 BILLION THAT EXTEND THROUGH 2024. PURCHASE ORDER COMMITMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH

INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TABLE ABOVE. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH A PURCHASE ORDER COMMITMENT FROM US, A FOREIGN SUPPLIER MUST HAVE SUFFICIENT CAPABILITY TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS AND MUST BE COMPETITIVE IN COST, QUALITY

AND SCHEDULE.

INCOME TAX OBLIGATIONS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR TOTAL LIABILITY FOR INCOME TAXES PAYABLE, INCLUDING UNCERTAIN TAX

POSITIONS, WAS $499 MILLION, OF WHICH $81 MILLION WE EXPECT TO PAY IN THE NEXT TWELVE MONTHS. WE ARE NOT ABLE TO REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS RELATED TO THE REMAINING $418 MILLION. OUR INCOME TAX OBLIGATIONS ARE EXCLUDED FROM

THE TABLE ABOVE. SEE NOTE 5 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

WE ARE A PARTY TO CERTAIN

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDING CERTAIN GUARANTEES. FOR DISCUSSION OF THESE ARRANGEMENTS, SEE NOTE 12 TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING INVOLVES A JUDGMENTAL PROCESS OF ESTIMATING THE TOTAL SALES AND COSTS FOR EACH CONTRACT, WHICH RESULTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES. FOR EACH CONTRACT, THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED.

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DUE TO THE SIZE, DURATION AND NATURE OF MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS, THE ESTIMATION OF TOTAL SALES AND COSTS THROUGH

COMPLETION IS COMPLICATED AND SUBJECT TO MANY VARIABLES. TOTAL CONTRACT SALES ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON NEGOTIATED CONTRACT PRICES AND QUANTITIES, MODIFIED BY OUR ASSUMPTIONS REGARDING CONTRACT OPTIONS, CHANGE ORDERS, INCENTIVE AND AWARD PROVISIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE, AND PRICE ADJUSTMENT CLAUSES (SUCH AS INFLATION OR INDEX-BASED CLAUSES). THE MAJORITY OF THESE CONTRACTS ARE WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. GENERALLY THE PRICE IS BASED ON ESTIMATED COST TO PRODUCE THE PRODUCT OR

SERVICE PLUS PROFIT. FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE TYPES OF COST THAT WILL BE REIMBURSED IN ESTABLISHING CONTRACT PRICE. TOTAL CONTRACT COST ESTIMATES ARE LARGELY BASED ON NEGOTIATED OR ESTIMATED PURCHASE CONTRACT TERMS,

HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS BASE AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE INFLATIONARY TRENDS, TECHNICAL AND SCHEDULE RISK, INTERNAL AND SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS VOLUME ASSUMPTIONS,

ASSET UTILIZATION, AND ANTICIPATED LABOR AGREEMENTS.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES INVOLVES PROCEDURES AND PERSONNEL IN ALL AREAS THAT

PROVIDE FINANCIAL OR PRODUCTION INFORMATION ON THE STATUS OF CONTRACTS. ESTIMATES OF EACH SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS SALES AND COSTS ARE REVIEWED AND REASSESSED QUARTERLY. ANY CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES RESULT IN RECOGNITION OF CUMULATIVE

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CONTRACT PROFIT IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH CHANGES ARE MADE.

DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JUDGMENT IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS DESCRIBED

ABOVE, IT IS LIKELY THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT COST OF SALES AMOUNTS COULD BE RECORDED IF WE USED DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR IF THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS/ESTIMATES, SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE, OR

CIRCUMSTANCES MAY ADVERSELY OR POSITIVELY AFFECT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN FUTURE PERIODS. IF THE COMBINED GROSS MARGIN FOR ALL CONTRACTS IN BDS FOR ALL OF 2010 HAD BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE HIGHER OR LOWER BY 1%, IT WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED

PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE YEAR BY APPROXIMATELY $319 MILLION. A NUMBER OF OUR CONTRACTS ARE IN A REACHFORWARD LOSS POSITION. CHANGES TO ESTIMATED LOSS IN FUTURE PERIODS ARE RECORDED IMMEDIATELY IN EARNINGS.

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES THE

DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE RELATIONSHIP OF SALES TO COSTS FOR THE DEFINED PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING,

LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY IS LIMITED BY THE ABILITY TO MAKE REASONABLY DEPENDABLE ESTIMATES OF THE REVENUE AND COST OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED

CONTRACTS. FOR EACH PROGRAM, THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE FOR THE TOTAL REMAINING PROGRAM TO THE AMOUNT OF SALES RECOGNIZED FOR AIRPLANES DELIVERED AND ACCEPTED BY THE

CUSTOMER.

FACTORS THAT MUST BE ESTIMATED INCLUDE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, SALES PRICE, LABOR AND EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS, MATERIAL COSTS, PROCURED

PART COSTS, MAJOR COMPONENT COSTS, OVERHEAD COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS, AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS. ESTIMATION OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH PROGRAM TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SEVERAL FACTORS THAT ARE INDICATIVE OF THE DEMAND FOR THE PARTICULAR

PROGRAM, SUCH AS FIRM ORDERS, LETTERS OF INTENT FROM PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS, AND MARKET STUDIES. TOTAL ESTIMATED PROGRAM SALES ARE DETERMINED BY ESTIMATING THE MODEL MIX AND SALES PRICE FOR ALL UNSOLD UNITS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, ADDED

TOGETHER WITH THE SALES PRICES FOR ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS UNDER CONTRACT. THE SALES PRICES FOR ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY INCLUDE AN ESCALATION ADJUSTMENT THAT IS BASED ON PROJECTED ESCALATION RATES, CONSISTENT WITH TYPICAL

SALES CONTRACT TERMS. COST ESTIMATES ARE BASED LARGELY ON NEGOTIATED AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS WITH SUPPLIERS, HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS, AND BUSINESS BASE AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS. FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE PRODUCTION

RATES, INTERNAL AND SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, CUSTOMER AND/OR SUPPLIER CLAIMS OR ASSERTIONS, ASSET UTILIZATION, ANTICIPATED LABOR AGREEMENTS, AND INFLATIONARY TRENDS.

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO ENSURE RELIABILITY IN OUR ESTIMATES, WE EMPLOY A RIGOROUS ESTIMATING PROCESS THAT IS REVIEWED AND UPDATED ON A

QUARTERLY BASIS. CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE NORMALLY RECOGNIZED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS; WHEN ESTIMATED COSTS TO COMPLETE A PROGRAM EXCEED ESTIMATED REVENUES FROM UNDELIVERED UNITS IN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, A LOSS PROVISION IS RECORDED IN THE CURRENT

PERIOD FOR THE ESTIMATED LOSS ON ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS IN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY.

THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING ALLOCATES TOOLING AND PRODUCTION

COSTS OVER THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH PROGRAM. BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW PROGRAM AND SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT REQUIRED FOR INITIAL TOOLING, NEW COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE 787

PROGRAM, TYPICALLY HAVE LOWER MARGINS THAN ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS.

DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANCE OF JUDGMENT IN THE ESTIMATION PROCESS DESCRIBED ABOVE, IT IS

LIKELY THAT MATERIALLY DIFFERENT COST OF SALES AMOUNTS COULD BE RECORDED IF WE USED DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS, OR IF THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS/ESTIMATES, SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE, OR CIRCUMSTANCES MAY

ADVERSELY OR POSITIVELY AFFECT FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE IN FUTURE PERIODS. IF COMBINED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAMS, EXCLUDING THE 747 AND 787 PROGRAMS, FOR ALL OF 2010 HAD BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE HIGHER OR LOWER BY 1%, IT

WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED PRE-TAX INCOME FOR THE YEAR BY APPROXIMATELY $261 MILLION.

THE 747 PROGRAM IS IN A REACH-FORWARD LOSS POSITION HAVING

RECORDED A TOTAL OF $2,037 MILLION OF REACH-FORWARD LOSSES IN 2009 AND 2008. ABSENT CHANGES IN THE ESTIMATED REVENUES OR COSTS, SUBSEQUENT DELIVERIES ARE RECORDED AT ZERO MARGIN. REDUCTIONS TO THE ESTIMATED LOSS IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS ARE SPREAD OVER

ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS IN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, WHEREAS INCREASES TO THE ESTIMATED LOSS ARE RECORDED IMMEDIATELY.

OUR CURRENT ASSESSMENT IS THAT THE

787 PROGRAM DOES NOT HAVE A REACH-FORWARD LOSS. THE CUMULATIVE IMPACTS OF THE PRODUCTION CHALLENGES, SCHEDULE DELAYS AND CUSTOMER AND SUPPLIER IMPACTS HAVE CREATED SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE ON REVENUE AND COST ESTIMATES SUCH THAT WE EXPECT TO RECORD ZERO

MARGIN ON THE INITIAL DELIVERIES. THE SCALE AND DURATION OF THE 787 PROGRAM IS SUCH THAT RELATIVELY MINOR CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS OR VARIABLES COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR REPORTED RESULTS IN ANY PERIOD IF THE PROGRAM IS DETERMINED TO HAVE A

REACH-FORWARD LOSS.

AIRCRAFT VALUATION

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES (VALUATION PROVISION) IS USED TO PROVIDE

FOR POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. THE BALANCE REPRESENTS AN ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE BUT UNCONFIRMED LOSSES IN THE CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO. THE ESTIMATE IS

BASED ON VARIOUS QUALITATIVE AND QUANTITATIVE FACTORS, INCLUDING HISTORICAL LOSS EXPERIENCE, COLLATERAL VALUES, AND RESULTS OF INDIVIDUAL CREDIT AND COLLECTIBILITY REVIEWS. THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE IS ASSESSED QUARTERLY.

THREE PRIMARY FACTORS INFLUENCING THE LEVEL OF OUR ALLOWANCE ARE CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS, COLLATERAL VALUES AND DEFAULT RATES. IF EACH CUSTOMERS CREDIT

RATING WERE UPGRADED OR DOWNGRADED BY ONE MAJOR RATING CATEGORY AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE ALLOWANCE WOULD HAVE DECREASED BY $163 MILLION OR INCREASED BY $343 MILLION. IF THE COLLATERAL VALUES WERE 20% HIGHER OR LOWER AT DECEMBER 31, 2010,

THE ALLOWANCE WOULD HAVE DECREASED BY $94 MILLION OR INCREASED BY $72 MILLION. IF THE CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATES USED FOR EACH RATING CATEGORY SHOULD INCREASE OR DECREASE 1%, THE ALLOWANCE WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED BY $7 MILLION.

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND HELD FOR RE-LEASE

WE EVALUATE FOR IMPAIRMENT ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR ASSETS HELD FOR

RE-LEASE WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW FROM THE ASSET MAY BE LESS THAN ITS CARRYING VALUE. WE USE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS WHEN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

INCLUDING THE EXPECTED FUTURE LEASE RATES, LEASE TERMS, RESIDUAL VALUE OF THE ASSET, PERIODS IN WHICH THE ASSET MAY BE HELD IN PREPARATION FOR A FOLLOW-ON LEASE, MAINTENANCE COSTS, REMARKETING COSTS AND THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSET.

WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE RECORDED IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE

FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

HAD FUTURE LEASE RATES ON ASSETS EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT BEEN 10% LOWER, WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WOULD HAVE INCURRED ADDITIONAL

IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE OF $30 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010.

RESIDUAL VALUES

EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND ASSETS HELD

FOR RE-LEASE ARE CARRIED AT COST LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND ARE DEPRECIATED TO ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE PERIOD THAT WE PROJECT WE WILL HOLD THE ASSET FOR LEASE. ESTIMATES USED IN DETERMINING RESIDUAL

VALUES SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF DEPRECIATION EXPENSE FOR EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND ASSETS HELD FOR RE-LEASE. IF THE ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES DECLINED 20% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WOULD HAVE

INCURRED ADDITIONAL IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE OF $31 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, AND A FUTURE CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX EARNINGS REDUCTION OF APPROXIMATELY $132 MILLION RECOGNIZED OVER THE REMAINING DEPRECIABLE PERIODS, OF WHICH

APPROXIMATELY $30 MILLION WOULD BE RECOGNIZED IN 2011.

OUR INVESTMENT IN SALES-TYPE/FINANCE LEASES INCLUDES FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS RECEIVABLE

PLUS THE ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OF LEASED ASSETS LESS UNEARNED INCOME. DECLINES IN ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE THAT ARE DEEMED OTHER THAN TEMPORARY ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DECLINE OCCURS. IF THE ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUES DECLINED

20% AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE ESTIMATE THAT WE WOULD HAVE REDUCED PRE-TAX INCOME BY $50 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010.

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE IMPAIRMENTS

GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED BUT ARE ANNUALLY TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT, AND WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SUCH THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. APRIL 1 IS OUR ANNUAL TESTING DATE. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT BY FIRST COMPARING THE BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED

OPERATIONS. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN BOOK VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. IN THIS PROCESS, A FAIR VALUE FOR GOODWILL IS ESTIMATED, BASED IN PART ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPERATIONS,

AND IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE SHORTFALL OF THE FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.

WE ESTIMATE

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. FORECASTS OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE SALES AND OPERATING COSTS, BASED PRIMARILY ON EXISTING FIRM ORDERS, EXPECTED FUTURE ORDERS, CONTRACTS WITH

SUPPLIERS, LABOR AGREEMENTS, AND GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS. CHANGES IN THESE FORECASTS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT RECORDED, IF ANY.

THE CASH FLOW FORECASTS ARE ADJUSTED BY AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE DERIVED FROM OUR MARKET CAPITALIZATION PLUS A SUITABLE CONTROL PREMIUM AT THE DATE OF EVALUATION. THEREFORE, CHANGES IN THE STOCK PRICE MAY ALSO

AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT RECORDED, IF ANY.

CHANGES IN OUR FORECASTS OR DECREASES IN THE VALUE OF OUR COMMON STOCK COULD CAUSE BOOK VALUES OF

CERTAIN OPERATIONS TO EXCEED THEIR FAIR VALUES WHICH MAY RESULT IN GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES IN FUTURE

45

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PERIODS. A 10% DECREASE IN THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF ANY OF OUR OPERATIONS WOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON THE CARRYING VALUE OF GOODWILL.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, WE HAD $499 MILLION OF INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS RELATED TO THE JEPPESEN AND AVIALL BRAND AND TRADE NAMES ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WE TEST THESE INTANGIBLES

FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR CARRYING VALUE TO CURRENT PROJECTIONS OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BRAND AND TRADE NAMES. ANY EXCESS CARRYING VALUE OVER THE AMOUNT OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. A

10% DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS WOULD REDUCE THE CARRYING VALUE OF THESE INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS BY LESS THAN $1 MILLION.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

ALMOST ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE

COVERED BY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ALL NONUNION AND SOME UNION EMPLOYEES HIRED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2008. WE ALSO HAVE OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTHCARE COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES

AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS. ACCOUNTING RULES REQUIRE AN ANNUAL MEASUREMENT OF OUR PROJECTED OBLIGATIONS AND PLAN ASSETS. THESE MEASUREMENTS ARE BASED UPON SEVERAL ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN,

AND MEDICAL TREND RATE (RATE OF GROWTH FOR MEDICAL COSTS). FUTURE CHANGES IN ASSUMPTIONS OR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ACTUAL AND EXPECTED OUTCOMES CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR FUTURE ANNUAL EXPENSE, PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AND SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SHOWS THE SENSITIVITY OF OUR PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLAN LIABILITIES AND NET PERIODIC COST TO A 25 BASIS

PENSION EXPENSE IS ALSO SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN. A DECREASE OR INCREASE OF 25 BASIS POINTS

IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED 2010 NET PERIODIC PENSION EXPENSE BY $123 MILLION.

DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

ACTUAL AND EXPECTED RETURNS CAN AFFECT FUTURE YEARS PENSION COST. THE ASSET BALANCE USED TO CALCULATE THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PENSION PLAN ASSETS IS A CALCULATED VALUE THAT RECOGNIZES CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS OVER A FIVE YEAR PERIOD.

DESPITE INVESTMENT GAINS DURING 2010 AND 2009, THE SIGNIFICANT LOSSES INCURRED DURING 2008 WILL CAUSE 2011 NET PERIODIC PENSION COST TO INCREASE BY APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION AND THE PORTION RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS FOR 2011 TO INCREASE BY

APPROXIMATELY $650 MILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO AMORTIZATION OF ACTUARIAL LOSSES. ABSENT INCREASES IN INTEREST RATES, HIGHER ASSET VALUES AND/OR HIGHER CONTRIBUTIONS, NET PERIODIC PENSION COST WILL INCREASE FURTHER IN FUTURE YEARS.

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE RISK

WE HAVE FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK, PRINCIPALLY FIXED-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, AND CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. ADDITIONALLY, BCC USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS WITH CERTAIN DEBT OBLIGATIONS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE

CHANGES. EXPOSURE TO THIS RISK IS MANAGED BY GENERALLY MATCHING THE PROFILE OF BCCS LIABILITIES WITH THAT OF BCCS ASSETS IN RELATION TO AMOUNT AND TERMS SUCH AS EXPECTED MATURITIES AND FIXED VERSUS FLOATING INTEREST RATES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE IMPACT OVER THE NEXT 12 MONTHS OF A 100 BASIS POINT IMMEDIATE AND SUSTAINED RISE IN INTEREST RATES WOULD BE A $5 MILLION INCREASE TO BCCS PRE-TAX EARNINGS. FOR PURPOSES OF THE FOREGOING SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS, WE

ASSUME THAT THE LEVEL OF OUR FLOATING RATE ASSETS AND DEBT (INCLUDING THE IMPACT OF DERIVATIVES) REMAIN UNCHANGED FROM YEAR-END 2010 AND THAT THEY ARE ALL SUBJECT TO IMMEDIATE RE-PRICING. HISTORICALLY, WE HAVE NOT EXPERIENCED MATERIAL GAINS OR

LOSSES ON OUR INVESTMENTS OR CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES DUE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

BASED ON THE PORTFOLIO OF OTHER BOEING FIXED-RATE

DEBT, THE UNHEDGED EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IS NOT MATERIAL. THE INVESTORS IN OUR FIXED-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS DO NOT GENERALLY HAVE THE RIGHT TO DEMAND WE PAY OFF THESE OBLIGATIONS PRIOR TO MATURITY. THEREFORE, EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK

IS NOT BELIEVED TO BE MATERIAL FOR OUR FIXED-RATE DEBT.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

WE ARE SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK RELATING TO RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. WE USE FOREIGN CURRENCY

FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS TO HEDGE THE PRICE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FIRMLY COMMITTED AND FORECASTED FOREIGN DENOMINATED PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS RELATED TO OUR ONGOING BUSINESS. FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD AND OPTION CONTRACTS ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, A 10% INCREASE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS WOULD HAVE DECREASED OUR UNREALIZED GAINS BY $159 MILLION AND A 10% DECREASE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE WOULD

HAVE INCREASED OUR UNREALIZED GAINS BY $173 MILLION. AT DECEMBER 31, 2009, A 10% INCREASE IN THE EXCHANGE RATE IN OUR PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS WOULD HAVE DECREASED OUR UNREALIZED GAINS BY $136 MILLION AND A 10% DECREASE IN THE

EXCHANGE RATE WOULD HAVE INCREASED OUR UNREALIZED GAINS BY $150 MILLION. CONSISTENT WITH THE USE OF THESE CONTRACTS TO NEUTRALIZE THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS, SUCH UNREALIZED LOSSES OR GAINS WOULD BE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING GAINS OR

LOSSES, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE REMEASUREMENT OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING HEDGED. WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE FORWARD CURRENCY CONTRACTS AND THE OFFSETTING UNDERLYING COMMITMENTS DO NOT CREATE MATERIAL MARKET RISK.

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS, EXCEPT PER SHARE

DATA)

NOTE 1  SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION AND BASIS OF PRESENTATION

THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDED IN THIS REPORT HAVE BEEN PREPARED BY MANAGEMENT OF THE BOEING COMPANY (HEREIN REFERRED TO AS BOEING, THE COMPANY, WE, US, OR OUR). THESE

STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF ALL MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES AND VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE CONSOLIDATED. ALL SIGNIFICANT INTERCOMPANY ACCOUNTS AND TRANSACTIONS HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. CERTAIN AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN

RECLASSIFIED TO CONFORM TO THE CURRENT YEAR PRESENTATION.

USE OF ESTIMATES

MANAGEMENT MAKES ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES TO PREPARE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. THOSE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES DIRECTLY

AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES FOR WHICH CHANGES IN THE NEAR TERM ARE CONSIDERED REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE DISCLOSED IN THESE

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OPERATING CYCLE

FOR CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, WE USE THE DURATION OF THE RELATED CONTRACT OR PROGRAM AS OUR OPERATING CYCLE, WHICH IS GENERALLY LONGER THAN ONE YEAR AND COULD EXCEED THREE YEARS.

REVENUE AND RELATED COST RECOGNITION

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING IS USED FOR DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION ACTIVITIES PREDOMINANTLY BY BOEING DEFENSE, SPACE & SECURITY (BDS).

THE MAJORITY OF BUSINESS CONDUCTED BY BDS IS PERFORMED UNDER CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND OTHER CUSTOMERS THAT EXTEND OVER SEVERAL YEARS. CONTRACT ACCOUNTING INVOLVES A JUDGMENTAL PROCESS OF ESTIMATING THE TOTAL SALES AND COSTS FOR EACH

CONTRACT RESULTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES. FOR EACH CONTRACT, THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED.

WE COMBINE CONTRACTS FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES WHEN THEY ARE NEGOTIATED AS A PACKAGE WITH AN OVERALL PROFIT MARGIN OBJECTIVE, ESSENTIALLY REPRESENT AN AGREEMENT TO

DO A SINGLE PROJECT FOR A SINGLE CUSTOMER, INVOLVE INTERRELATED CONSTRUCTION ACTIVITIES WITH SUBSTANTIAL COMMON COSTS, AND ARE PERFORMED CONCURRENTLY OR SEQUENTIALLY. WHEN A GROUP OF CONTRACTS IS COMBINED, REVENUE AND PROFIT ARE EARNED UNIFORMLY

OVER THE PERFORMANCE OF THE COMBINED CONTRACTS.

SALES RELATED TO FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS DELIVERIES ARE MADE, EXCEPT FOR CERTAIN

FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD BEFORE DELIVERIES BEGIN, FOR WHICH SALES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ATTAINMENT OF PERFORMANCE MILESTONES. SALES RELATED TO CONTRACTS IN WHICH WE ARE REIMBURSED FOR

COSTS INCURRED PLUS AN AGREED UPON PROFIT ARE RECORDED AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. THE FEDERAL ACQUISITION REGULATIONS PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON THE TYPES OF COST THAT WILL BE REIMBURSED IN ESTABLISHING CONTRACT PRICE. CONTRACTS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS TO EARN

INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES IF SPECIFIED TARGETS ARE ACHIEVED. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED AND ARE PROBABLE ARE RECORDED OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD OF THE CONTRACT. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT CANNOT BE REASONABLY

ESTIMATED ARE RECORDED WHEN AWARDED.

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT PREDOMINANTLY USES PROGRAM ACCOUNTING TO ACCOUNT FOR COST

OF SALES RELATED TO ITS PROGRAMS. PROGRAM ACCOUNTING IS APPLICABLE TO PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED FOR DELIVERY UNDER PRODUCTION-TYPE CONTRACTS WHERE PROFITABILITY IS REALIZED OVER MULTIPLE CONTRACTS AND YEARS. UNDER PROGRAM ACCOUNTING, INVENTORIABLE

PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS, AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED AND CHARGED TO COST OF SALES BY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF BY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR CONTRACTS. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A

PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. THE DETERMINATION OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY IS LIMITED BY THE ABILITY TO MAKE REASONABLY DEPENDABLE ESTIMATES OF THE REVENUE

AND COST OF EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP OF SALES TO COST OF SALES, PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF (A) THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN A PROGRAM, (B) THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE

UNITS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED, AND (C) THE UNITS EXPECTED SALES PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING, AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM.

WE RECOGNIZE SALES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DELIVERIES AS EACH UNIT IS COMPLETED AND ACCEPTED BY THE CUSTOMER. SALES RECOGNIZED REPRESENT THE PRICE NEGOTIATED WITH THE CUSTOMER, ADJUSTED BY AN ESCALATION FORMULA AS

SPECIFIED IN THE CUSTOMER AGREEMENT. THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES PERCENTAGE FOR THE TOTAL REMAINING PROGRAM TO THE AMOUNT OF SALES RECOGNIZED FOR AIRPLANES DELIVERED AND ACCEPTED BY THE

CUSTOMER.

CONCESSION SHARING ARRANGEMENTS

WE ACCOUNT FOR SALES CONCESSIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS IN CONSIDERATION OF THEIR PURCHASE OF PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE WHEN THE RELATED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DELIVERED. THE SALES CONCESSIONS INCURRED MAY BE PARTIALLY REIMBURSED BY CERTAIN SUPPLIERS IN ACCORDANCE WITH CONCESSION SHARING ARRANGEMENTS. WE RECORD THESE

REIMBURSEMENTS, WHICH ARE PRESUMED TO REPRESENT REDUCTIONS IN THE PRICE OF THE VENDORS PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AS A REDUCTION IN COST OF PRODUCTS.

SPARE PARTS REVENUE

WE RECOGNIZE SALES OF SPARE PARTS UPON DELIVERY AND THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS RECORDED AT AVERAGE COST.

SERVICE REVENUE

SERVICE REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE SERVICE IS PERFORMED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF U.S. GOVERNMENT SERVICE AGREEMENTS, WHICH ARE ACCOUNTED

FOR USING CONTRACT ACCOUNTING. SERVICE ACTIVITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE: SUPPORT AGREEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND HELICOPTER CONTRACTS, ONGOING MAINTENANCE OF INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND SPACE SHUTTLE, COMMERCIAL DELTA LAUNCHES AND

TECHNICAL AND FLIGHT OPERATION SERVICES FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. SERVICE REVENUE AND ASSOCIATED COST OF SALES FROM PAY-IN-ADVANCE SUBSCRIPTION FEES ARE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED.

FINANCIAL SERVICES REVENUE

WE RECORD FINANCIAL SERVICES REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH SALES-TYPE FINANCE LEASES, OPERATING LEASES, AND NOTES RECEIVABLE.

LEASE AND FINANCING REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN SALES OF SERVICES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR SALES-TYPE FINANCE LEASES,

WE RECORD AN ASSET AT LEASE INCEPTION. THIS ASSET IS RECORDED AT THE AGGREGATE FUTURE MINIMUM LEASE PAYMENTS, ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE OF THE LEASED EQUIPMENT, AND DEFERRED INCREMENTAL DIRECT COSTS LESS UNEARNED INCOME. INCOME IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE

LIFE OF THE LEASE TO APPROXIMATE A LEVEL RATE OF RETURN ON THE NET INVESTMENT. RESIDUAL VALUES, WHICH ARE REVIEWED PERIODICALLY, REPRESENT THE ESTIMATED AMOUNT WE EXPECT TO RECEIVE AT LEASE TERMINATION FROM THE DISPOSITION OF THE LEASED EQUIPMENT.

ACTUAL RESIDUAL VALUES REALIZED COULD DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES. DECLINES IN ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE THAT ARE DEEMED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY ARE RECOGNIZED AS COST OF SERVICES IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DECLINES OCCUR.

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FOR OPERATING LEASES, REVENUE ON LEASED AIRCRAFT AND EQUIPMENT IS RECORDED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE TERM OF

THE LEASE. OPERATING LEASE ASSETS, INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER FINANCING, ARE RECORDED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED OVER THE PERIOD THAT WE PROJECT WE WILL HOLD THE ASSET TO AN ESTIMATED RESIDUAL VALUE, USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. PREPAYMENTS RECEIVED ON

OPERATING LEASE CONTRACTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. WE PERIODICALLY REVIEW OUR ESTIMATES OF RESIDUAL VALUE AND RECOGNIZE FORECASTED CHANGES BY PROSPECTIVELY ADJUSTING

DEPRECIATION EXPENSE.

FOR NOTES RECEIVABLE, NOTES ARE RECORDED NET OF ANY UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNTS AND DEFERRED INCREMENTAL DIRECT COSTS. INTEREST INCOME

AND AMORTIZATION OF ANY DISCOUNTS ARE RECORDED RATABLY OVER THE RELATED TERM OF THE NOTE.

REINSURANCE REVENUE

OUR WHOLLY-OWNED INSURANCE

SUBSIDIARY, ASTRO LTD., PARTICIPATES IN A REINSURANCE POOL FOR WORKERS COMPENSATION. THE MEMBER AGREEMENTS AND PRACTICES OF THE REINSURANCE POOL MINIMIZE ANY PARTICIPATING MEMBERS INDIVIDUAL RISK. REINSURANCE REVENUES WERE $139, $122 AND

$83 DURING 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. REINSURANCE COSTS RELATED TO PREMIUMS AND CLAIMS PAID TO THE REINSURANCE POOL WERE $123, $118 AND $86 DURING 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. REVENUES AND COSTS ARE PRESENTED NET IN COST OF SERVICES IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

FLEET SUPPORT

WE PROVIDE ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES TO FACILITATE EFFICIENT AND SAFE AIRCRAFT OPERATION TO THE OPERATORS OF ALL OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE MODELS. COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS FLEET SUPPORT SERVICES, THESE ACTIVITIES AND

SERVICES INCLUDE FLIGHT AND MAINTENANCE TRAINING, FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT, ENGINEERING SERVICES, AND TECHNICAL DATA AND DOCUMENTS. FLEET SUPPORT ACTIVITY BEGINS PRIOR TO AIRCRAFT DELIVERY AS THE CUSTOMER RECEIVES TRAINING, MANUALS, AND TECHNICAL

CONSULTING SUPPORT. THIS ACTIVITY CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE AIRCRAFTS OPERATIONAL LIFE. SERVICES PROVIDED AFTER DELIVERY INCLUDE FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT, CONSULTING ON MAINTENANCE, REPAIR, AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES BROUGHT FORTH BY THE CUSTOMER OR

REGULATORS, UPDATING MANUALS AND ENGINEERING DATA, AND THE ISSUANCE OF SERVICE BULLETINS THAT IMPACT THE ENTIRE MODELS FLEET. FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT INVOLVES OUR PERSONNEL LOCATED AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES PROVIDING AND COORDINATING FLEET SUPPORT

ACTIVITIES AND REQUESTS. THE COSTS FOR FLEET SUPPORT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED AS COST OF SERVICES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INCLUDES COSTS INCURRED FOR EXPERIMENTATION, DESIGN, TESTING, AND BID AND PROPOSAL EFFORTS RELATED TO GOVERNMENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

WHICH ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED UNLESS THE COSTS ARE RELATED TO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS. COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED PURSUANT TO SUCH CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENTS ARE RECORDED OVER THE PERIOD THAT REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED, CONSISTENT

WITH OUR CONTRACT ACCOUNTING POLICY. WE HAVE CERTAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ARRANGEMENTS THAT MEET THE REQUIREMENT FOR BEST EFFORTS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACCOUNTING. ACCORDINGLY, THE AMOUNTS FUNDED BY THE CUSTOMER ARE RECOGNIZED AS AN OFFSET TO

OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE RATHER THAN AS CONTRACT REVENUES.

WE HAVE ESTABLISHED COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS WITH SOME SUPPLIERS FOR THE 787

PROGRAM. OUR COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS STATE THAT THE SUPPLIER CONTRIBUTIONS ARE FOR REIMBURSEMENTS OF COSTS WE INCUR FOR EXPERIMENTATION, BASIC DESIGN, AND TESTING ACTIVITIES DURING THE 787 DEVELOPMENT. IN EACH ARRANGEMENT, WE RETAIN SUBSTANTIAL

RIGHTS TO THE 787 PART OR COMPONENT COVERED BY THE ARRANGEMENT. THE AMOUNTS RECEIVED FROM THESE COST SHARING ARRANGEMENTS ARE RECORDED AS A REDUCTION TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES SINCE WE HAVE NO OBLIGATION TO REFUND ANY AMOUNTS RECEIVED PER

THE ARRANGEMENTS REGARDLESS OF THE OUTCOME OF THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. SPECIFICALLY, UNDER THE TERMS OF EACH AGREEMENT, PAYMENTS RECEIVED FROM SUPPLIERS FOR THEIR SHARE OF THE COSTS ARE TYPICALLY BASED ON

58

TABLE OF CONTENTS

MILESTONES AND ARE RECOGNIZED AS EARNED WHEN WE ACHIEVE THE MILESTONE EVENTS AND NO ONGOING OBLIGATION ON OUR PART EXISTS. IN THE EVENT WE RECEIVE A MILESTONE PAYMENT PRIOR TO THE COMPLETION OF

THE MILESTONE, THE AMOUNT IS CLASSIFIED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES UNTIL EARNED.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

WE PROVIDE VARIOUS FORMS OF SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION TO OUR EMPLOYEES. FOR AWARDS SETTLED IN SHARES, WE MEASURE COMPENSATION EXPENSE BASED ON THE GRANT-DATE FAIR

VALUE NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES. FOR AWARDS SETTLED IN CASH, OR THAT MAY BE SETTLED IN CASH, WE MEASURE COMPENSATION EXPENSE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE AT EACH REPORTING DATE NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES. THE EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE REQUISITE

SERVICE PERIOD, WHICH IS GENERALLY THE VESTING PERIOD OF THE AWARD.

INCOME TAXES

PROVISIONS FOR FEDERAL, STATE, AND NON-U.S. INCOME TAXES ARE CALCULATED ON REPORTED EARNINGS BEFORE INCOME TAXES BASED ON CURRENT TAX LAW AND ALSO INCLUDE, IN THE CURRENT PERIOD, THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ANY

CHANGES IN TAX RATES FROM THOSE USED PREVIOUSLY IN DETERMINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. SUCH PROVISIONS DIFFER FROM THE AMOUNTS CURRENTLY RECEIVABLE OR PAYABLE BECAUSE CERTAIN ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE RECOGNIZED IN DIFFERENT TIME

PERIODS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES THAN FOR INCOME TAX PURPOSES. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND EVALUATING TAX POSITIONS.

THE ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES REQUIRES A MORE-LIKELY-THAN-NOT THRESHOLD FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT OF TAX POSITIONS TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. WE RECORD

A LIABILITY FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE BENEFIT RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENT PURPOSES AND THE TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN ON OUR TAX RETURN. TO THE EXTENT THAT OUR ASSESSMENT OF SUCH TAX POSITIONS CHANGES, THE

CHANGE IN ESTIMATE IS RECORDED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE DETERMINATION IS MADE. TAX-RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS A COMPONENT OF INCOME TAX EXPENSE.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

ALMOST ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE COVERED BY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS WITH THE

EXCEPTION OF ALL NONUNION AND SOME UNION EMPLOYEES HIRED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2008. WE ALSO PROVIDE POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS.

BENEFITS UNDER THE PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AGE AT RETIREMENT AND YEARS OF SERVICE AND, FOR SOME PENSION PLANS, BENEFITS ARE ALSO BASED ON THE EMPLOYEES ANNUAL EARNINGS. THE NET PERIODIC COST OF OUR

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IS DETERMINED USING THE PROJECTED UNIT CREDIT METHOD AND SEVERAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE THE DISCOUNT RATE, THE LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN, AND MEDICAL TREND (RATE OF GROWTH

FOR MEDICAL COSTS). A PORTION OF NET PERIODIC PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT INCOME OR EXPENSE IS NOT RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS IN THE YEAR INCURRED BECAUSE IT IS ALLOCATED TO PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT COSTS, AND REFLECTED IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF

A REPORTING PERIOD. IF GAINS AND LOSSES, WHICH OCCUR WHEN ACTUAL EXPERIENCE DIFFERS FROM ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, EXCEED TEN PERCENT OF THE GREATER OF PLAN ASSETS OR PLAN LIABILITIES WE AMORTIZE THEM OVER THE AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE PERIOD OF

EMPLOYEES. THE FUNDED STATUS OF OUR PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT PLANS IS REFLECTED ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. EFFECTIVE DECEMBER 31, 2008, ACCOUNTING STANDARDS REQUIRED US TO MEASURE OUR PLAN ASSETS AND BENEFIT

OBLIGATIONS AT DECEMBER 31, THE DATE OF OUR YEAR END. WE PREVIOUSLY PERFORMED THIS MEASUREMENT AT SEPTEMBER 30 OF EACH YEAR.

59

TABLE OF CONTENTS

POSTEMPLOYMENT PLANS

WE RECORD A LIABILITY FOR POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, SUCH AS SEVERANCE OR JOB TRAINING, WHEN PAYMENT IS PROBABLE, THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, AND THE OBLIGATION RELATES TO RIGHTS THAT HAVE VESTED OR

ACCUMULATED.

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THOSE FOR DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES. WE ROUTINELY ASSESS, BASED ON IN-DEPTH STUDIES, EXPERT ANALYSES AND LEGAL

REVIEWS, OUR CONTINGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS, AND COMMITMENTS FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RANGES AND PROBABILITIES OF RECOVERIES FROM OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES AND/OR INSURANCE CARRIERS. OUR POLICY IS TO ACCRUE AND

CHARGE TO CURRENT EXPENSE IDENTIFIED EXPOSURES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SITES BASED ON OUR BEST ESTIMATE OR THE LOW END OF A RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE EXPOSURE FOR INVESTIGATION, CLEANUP, AND MONITORING COSTS TO BE INCURRED. ESTIMATED

REMEDIATION COSTS ARE NOT DISCOUNTED TO PRESENT VALUE AS THE TIMING OF PAYMENTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. WE MAY BE ABLE TO RECOVER A PORTION OF THE REMEDIATION COSTS FROM INSURERS OR OTHER THIRD PARTIES. SUCH RECOVERIES ARE RECORDED WHEN

REALIZATION OF THE CLAIM FOR RECOVERY IS DEEMED PROBABLE.

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS CONSIST OF HIGHLY LIQUID INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS COMMERCIAL PAPER, TIME DEPOSITS, AND OTHER MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS, WHICH HAVE ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS. WE AGGREGATE OUR

CASH BALANCES BY BANK, AND RECLASSIFY ANY NEGATIVE BALANCES, CONSISTING MAINLY OF UNCLEARED CHECKS, TO ACCOUNTS PAYABLE. NEGATIVE BALANCES RECLASSIFIED TO ACCOUNTS PAYABLE WERE $209 AND $211 AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIED COSTS ON COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

PROGRAMS AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTS INCLUDE DIRECT ENGINEERING, PRODUCTION AND TOOLING COSTS, AND APPLICABLE OVERHEAD, WHICH INCLUDES FRINGE BENEFITS, PRODUCTION RELATED INDIRECT AND PLANT MANAGEMENT SALARIES AND PLANT SERVICES, NOT IN EXCESS OF

ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE. TO THE EXTENT A MATERIAL AMOUNT OF SUCH COSTS ARE RELATED TO AN ABNORMAL EVENT OR ARE FIXED COSTS NOT APPROPRIATELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR PROGRAMS OR CONTRACTS, THEY ARE EXPENSED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD RATHER THAN

INVENTORIED. INVENTORIED COSTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS RELATING TO PROGRAMS AND CONTRACTS WITH LONG-TERM PRODUCTION CYCLES, A PORTION OF WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED WITHIN ONE YEAR. INCLUDED IN INVENTORY FOR FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS IS AN

ALLOCATION OF ALLOWABLE COSTS RELATED TO MANUFACTURING PROCESS REENGINEERING.

BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING

OF A NEW OR DERIVATIVE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAM, THE ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED FOR PRODUCTION OF THE EARLY UNITS IN THE PROGRAM MAY EXCEED THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES FOR THOSE UNITS. IN ADDITION, THE APPLICATION OF A TOTAL PROGRAM GROSS

PROFIT RATE TO DELIVERED UNITS MAY RESULT IN COSTS ASSIGNED TO DELIVERED UNITS IN A REPORTING PERIOD BEING LESS THAN THE ACTUAL COST OF THOSE UNITS. THE EXCESS ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED OVER THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DISCLOSED AS DEFERRED

PRODUCTION COSTS, WHICH ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORY ALONG WITH UNAMORTIZED TOOLING COSTS.

THE DETERMINATION OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF LONG-TERM CONTRACT

COSTS IS BASED UPON QUARTERLY REVIEWS THAT ESTIMATE COSTS TO BE INCURRED TO COMPLETE ALL CONTRACT REQUIREMENTS. WHEN ACTUAL CONTRACT COSTS AND THE ESTIMATE TO COMPLETE EXCEED TOTAL ESTIMATED CONTRACT REVENUES, A LOSS PROVISION IS RECORDED. THE

DETERMINATION OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAM COSTS IS BASED UPON QUARTERLY PROGRAM REVIEWS THAT ESTIMATE REVENUE AND COST TO BE INCURRED TO COMPLETE THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

TABLE OF CONTENTS

QUANTITY. WHEN ESTIMATED COSTS TO COMPLETE EXCEED ESTIMATED PROGRAM REVENUES TO GO, A PROGRAM LOSS PROVISION IS RECORDED IN THE CURRENT PERIOD FOR THE ESTIMATED LOSS ON ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS IN

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY.

USED AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT AND GENERAL STOCK MATERIALS ARE STATED AT COST NOT IN EXCESS OF

NET REALIZABLE VALUE. SEE AIRCRAFT VALUATION WITHIN THIS NOTE FOR A DISCUSSION OF OUR VALUATION OF USED AIRCRAFT. SPARE PARTS INVENTORY IS STATED AT LOWER OF AVERAGE UNIT COST OR MARKET. WE REVIEW OUR COMMERCIAL SPARE PARTS AND GENERAL

STOCK MATERIALS QUARTERLY TO IDENTIFY IMPAIRED INVENTORY, INCLUDING EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY, BASED ON HISTORICAL SALES TRENDS, EXPECTED PRODUCTION USAGE, AND THE SIZE AND AGE OF THE AIRCRAFT FLEET USING THE PART. IMPAIRED INVENTORIES ARE

CHARGED TO COST OF PRODUCTS IN THE PERIOD THE IMPAIRMENT OCCURS.

INCLUDED IN INVENTORY FOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS ARE AMOUNTS PAID OR CREDITED IN

CASH, OR OTHER CONSIDERATION TO CERTAIN AIRLINE CUSTOMERS, THAT ARE REFERRED TO AS EARLY ISSUE SALES CONSIDERATION. EARLY ISSUE SALES CONSIDERATION IS RECOGNIZED AS A REDUCTION TO REVENUE WHEN THE DELIVERY OF THE AIRCRAFT UNDER CONTRACT OCCURS. IF

AN AIRLINE CUSTOMER DOES NOT PERFORM AND TAKE DELIVERY OF THE CONTRACTED AIRCRAFT, WE BELIEVE THAT WE WOULD HAVE THE ABILITY TO RECOVER AMOUNTS PAID. HOWEVER, TO THE EXTENT EARLY ISSUE SALES CONSIDERATION EXCEEDS ADVANCES AND IS NOT CONSIDERED TO BE

OTHERWISE RECOVERABLE, IT WOULD BE WRITTEN OFF IN THE CURRENT PERIOD.

WE NET ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS ON LONG-TERM CONTRACTS AGAINST INVENTORY IN

THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS IN EXCESS OF RELATED INVENTORY ARE REPORTED IN ADVANCES AND BILLINGS IN EXCESS OF RELATED COSTS.

PRECONTRACT COSTS

WE MAY, FROM TIME TO TIME, INCUR COSTS TO BEGIN FULFILLING THE STATEMENT OF WORK UNDER A

SPECIFIC ANTICIPATED CONTRACT THAT WE ARE STILL NEGOTIATING WITH A CUSTOMER. IF WE DETERMINE IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE AWARDED THE SPECIFIC ANTICIPATED CONTRACT, THEN WE CAPITALIZE THE PRECONTRACT COSTS WE INCUR, EXCLUDING START-UP COSTS WHICH

ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. CAPITALIZED PRECONTRACT COSTS OF $527 AND $183 AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORIES, NET OF ADVANCES AND PROGRESS BILLINGS, IN THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT

AND EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST, INCLUDING APPLICABLE CONSTRUCTION-PERIOD INTEREST, LESS ACCUMULATED DEPRECIATION AND ARE DEPRECIATED PRINCIPALLY OVER THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES: NEW BUILDINGS AND LAND IMPROVEMENTS, FROM 10 TO 40 YEARS;

AND NEW MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, FROM 3 TO 20 YEARS. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF DEPRECIATION ARE AS FOLLOWS: BUILDINGS AND LAND IMPROVEMENTS, 150% DECLINING BALANCE; AND MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS. CAPITALIZED INTERNAL

USE SOFTWARE IS INCLUDED IN OTHER ASSETS AND AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT LINE METHOD OVER FIVE YEARS. WE PERIODICALLY EVALUATE THE APPROPRIATENESS OF REMAINING DEPRECIABLE LIVES ASSIGNED TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS, INCLUDING ASSETS THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO

A MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR DISPOSITION.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR SALE ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE LESS COST TO SELL. LONG-LIVED ASSETS

HELD FOR USE ARE SUBJECT TO AN IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT WHENEVER EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS NO LONGER RECOVERABLE BASED UPON THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS

OF THE ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

WE RECORD ALL KNOWN ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS FOR WHICH THE LIABILITYS FAIR VALUE CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, INCLUDING CERTAIN ASBESTOS REMOVAL, ASSET DECOMMISSIONING AND CONTRACTUAL LEASE RESTORATION

OBLIGATIONS. RECORDED AMOUNTS ARE NOT MATERIAL.

WE ALSO HAVE KNOWN CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS, SUCH AS CERTAIN ASBESTOS REMEDIATION AND

ASSET DECOMMISSIONING ACTIVITIES TO BE PERFORMED IN THE FUTURE, THAT ARE NOT REASONABLY ESTIMABLE DUE TO INSUFFICIENT INFORMATION ABOUT THE TIMING AND METHOD OF SETTLEMENT OF THE OBLIGATION. ACCORDINGLY, THESE OBLIGATIONS HAVE NOT BEEN RECORDED IN

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. A LIABILITY FOR THESE OBLIGATIONS WILL BE RECORDED IN THE PERIOD WHEN SUFFICIENT INFORMATION REGARDING TIMING AND METHOD OF SETTLEMENT BECOMES AVAILABLE TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE LIABILITYS

FAIR VALUE. IN ADDITION, THERE MAY BE CONDITIONAL ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS THAT WE HAVE NOT YET DISCOVERED (E.G. ASBESTOS MAY EXIST IN CERTAIN BUILDINGS BUT WE HAVE NOT BECOME AWARE OF IT THROUGH THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS), AND THEREFORE,

THESE OBLIGATIONS ALSO HAVE NOT BEEN INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

GOODWILL AND OTHER ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WITH INDEFINITE LIVES ARE NOT AMORTIZED, BUT ARE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AND WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SUCH THAT IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. OUR ANNUAL TESTING DATE IS APRIL 1.

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR

IMPAIRMENT BY FIRST COMPARING THE CARRYING VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN CARRYING VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. IN THIS

PROCESS, A FAIR VALUE FOR GOODWILL IS ESTIMATED, BASED IN PART ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPERATIONS, AND IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE SHORTFALL OF THE FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT.

INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLES CONSIST OF BRAND AND TRADE NAMES ACQUIRED IN BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. WE TEST THESE INTANGIBLES FOR IMPAIRMENT BY COMPARING THEIR

CARRYING VALUE TO CURRENT PROJECTIONS OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE BRAND AND TRADE NAMES. ANY EXCESS CARRYING VALUE OVER THE AMOUNT OF DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT.

OUR FINITE-LIVED ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THEIR ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES AS FOLLOWS: DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY, FROM 3 TO 14

YEARS; PRODUCT KNOW-HOW, FROM 3 TO 30 YEARS; CUSTOMER BASE, FROM 3 TO 19 YEARS; DISTRIBUTION RIGHTS, FROM 9 TO 30 YEARS; AND OTHER, FROM 2 TO 32 YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF FINITE-LIVED ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS WHENEVER EVENTS

OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING AMOUNT MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS NO LONGER RECOVERABLE BASED UPON THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

INVESTMENTS

WE CLASSIFY INVESTMENT SECURITIES AS EITHER HELD-TO-MATURITY OR AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE. HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES INCLUDE TIME DEPOSITS AND ARE CARRIED AT COST.

AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES INCLUDE MARKETABLE DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES AND ENHANCED EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES AND ARE RECORDED AT THEIR FAIR VALUES, WITH

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES REPORTED AS PART OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON THE COST OF SECURITIES

62

TABLE OF CONTENTS

USING THE FIRST-IN, FIRST-OUT METHOD. REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ON ALL OTHER AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECOGNIZED BASED ON SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE

ASSESSED FOR IMPAIRMENT QUARTERLY.

THE EQUITY METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IS USED TO ACCOUNT FOR INVESTMENTS FOR WHICH WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE

SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE, BUT NOT CONTROL, OVER AN INVESTEE. SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE IS GENERALLY DEEMED TO EXIST IF WE HAVE AN OWNERSHIP INTEREST IN THE VOTING STOCK OF AN INVESTEE OF BETWEEN 20% AND 50%.

WE CLASSIFY INVESTMENT INCOME AND LOSS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS BASED ON WHETHER THE INVESTMENT IS OPERATING OR NON-OPERATING IN NATURE.

OPERATING INVESTMENTS ALIGN STRATEGICALLY AND ARE INTEGRATED WITH OUR OPERATIONS. EARNINGS FROM OPERATING INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING OUR SHARE OF INCOME OR LOSS FROM EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, DIVIDEND INCOME FROM CERTAIN COST METHOD INVESTMENTS, AND

ANY IMPAIRMENTS OR GAIN/LOSS ON THE DISPOSITION OF THESE INVESTMENTS, ARE RECORDED IN INCOME FROM OPERATING INVESTMENTS, NET. NON-OPERATING INVESTMENTS ARE THOSE WE HOLD FOR NON-STRATEGIC PURPOSES. EARNINGS FROM NON-OPERATING INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING

INTEREST AND DIVIDENDS ON MARKETABLE SECURITIES, AND ANY IMPAIRMENTS OR GAIN/LOSS ON THE DISPOSITION OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET.

DERIVATIVES

ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE

REGARDLESS OF THE PURPOSE OR INTENT OF HOLDING THEM. WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO PRINCIPALLY MANAGE A VARIETY OF MARKET RISKS. FOR DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED AS HEDGES OF THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE RECOGNIZED ASSET OR LIABILITY OR

A FIRM COMMITMENT (REFERRED TO AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES), THE GAIN OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE OFFSETTING LOSS OR GAIN ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. THE EFFECT OF THAT

ACCOUNTING IS TO INCLUDE IN EARNINGS THE EXTENT TO WHICH THE HEDGE IS NOT EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE. FOR OUR CASH FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE DERIVATIVES GAIN OR LOSS IS INITIALLY REPORTED IN

SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY (AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS) AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS IN THE SAME PERIOD OR PERIODS DURING WHICH THE HEDGED FORECASTED TRANSACTION AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION

OF THE GAIN OR LOSS OF A CASH FLOW HEDGE IS REPORTED IN EARNINGS IMMEDIATELY. WE ALSO HOLD CERTAIN INSTRUMENTS FOR ECONOMIC PURPOSES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. FOR THESE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, THE CHANGES IN THEIR FAIR

VALUE ARE ALSO RECORDED IN EARNINGS IMMEDIATELY.

AIRCRAFT VALUATION

USED AIRCRAFT UNDER TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS AND AIRCRAFT UNDER REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNING A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF NEW AIRCRAFT (SALE AIRCRAFT), WE HAVE ENTERED INTO

SPECIFIED-PRICE TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS THAT GIVE THEM THE RIGHT TO TRADE IN USED AIRCRAFT UPON THE PURCHASE OF SALE AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS WHEREIN WE

AGREE TO REPURCHASE THE SALE AIRCRAFT AT A SPECIFIED PRICE, GENERALLY 10 TO 15 YEARS AFTER DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT. OUR REPURCHASE OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT IS CONTINGENT UPON A FUTURE, MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW

AIRCRAFT. IF WE EXECUTE AN AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT, AND IF THE CUSTOMER EXERCISES ITS RIGHT TO SELL THE SALE AIRCRAFT TO US, A CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENT WOULD BECOME A TRADE-IN COMMITMENT. OUR HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE

IS THAT NO CONTINGENT REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS HAVE BECOME TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS.

63

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ALL TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 WERE SOLELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO SALE AIRCRAFT AND DID NOT

ORIGINATE FROM CONTINGENT REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS. EXPOSURE RELATED TO TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS MAY TAKE THE FORM OF.

(1)

ADJUSTMENTS TO REVENUE FOR THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN PRICE IN THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT AND OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF THE FAIR VALUE OF THE TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT AS

OF THE DATE OF SUCH AGREEMENT, WHICH WOULD BE RECORDED IN INVENTORY AND RECOGNIZED UPON DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT, AND/OR

(2)

CHARGES TO COST OF PRODUCTS FOR ADVERSE CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT THAT OCCUR SUBSEQUENT TO SIGNING OF A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT FOR SALE AIRCRAFT BUT PRIOR TO

THE PURCHASE OF THE USED TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT. ESTIMATES BASED ON CURRENT AIRCRAFT VALUES WOULD BE INCLUDED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES.

THE FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT IS DETERMINED USING AIRCRAFT-SPECIFIC DATA SUCH AS MODEL, AGE AND CONDITION, MARKET CONDITIONS FOR SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT AND

SIMILAR MODELS, AND MULTIPLE VALUATION SOURCES. THIS PROCESS USES OUR ASSESSMENT OF THE MARKET FOR EACH TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT, WHICH IN MOST INSTANCES BEGINS YEARS BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE AIRCRAFT. THERE ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE MARKETS IN WHICH WE

CONTINUALLY PURSUE OPPORTUNITIES TO PLACE USED AIRCRAFT. THESE MARKETS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, THE RESALE MARKET, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY INCLUDE THE COST OF LONG-TERM STORAGE; THE LEASING MARKET, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR REFURBISHMENT COSTS

TO MEET THE LEASING CUSTOMERS REQUIREMENTS; OR THE SCRAP MARKET. TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT VALUATION VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON WHICH MARKET WE DETERMINE IS MOST LIKELY FOR EACH AIRCRAFT. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, WE UPDATE OUR VALUATION ANALYSIS

BASED ON THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH PLACING EACH AIRCRAFT INTO A MARKET. THIS QUARTERLY VALUATION PROCESS YIELDS RESULTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY LOWER THAN RESIDUAL VALUE ESTIMATES BY INDEPENDENT SOURCES AND TENDS TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT

RESULTS UPON THE ACTUAL PLACEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT.

USED AIRCRAFT ACQUIRED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT ARE INCLUDED IN INVENTORIES AT THE LOWER

OF COST OR MARKET AS IT IS OUR INTENT TO SELL THESE ASSETS. TO MITIGATE COSTS AND ENHANCE MARKETABILITY, AIRCRAFT MAY BE PLACED ON OPERATING LEASE. WHILE ON OPERATING LEASE, THE ASSETS ARE INCLUDED IN CUSTOMER FINANCING.

ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASE, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE AND COLLATERAL UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES

CUSTOMER FINANCING INCLUDES OPERATING LEASE EQUIPMENT,

NOTES RECEIVABLES, AND SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES. SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASES ARE TREATED AS RECEIVABLES, AND ALLOWANCES FOR LOSSES ARE ESTABLISHED AS NECESSARY.

WE ASSESS THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSETS WE OWN, INCLUDING EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES, ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE, AND COLLATERAL UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES, TO DETERMINE IF THEIR FAIR VALUES ARE LESS THAN

THE RELATED ASSETS CARRYING VALUES. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CARRYING VALUES AND FAIR VALUES OF FINANCE LEASES AND NOTES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES, AS DETERMINED BY COLLATERAL VALUE, ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON

RECEIVABLES.

WE USE A MEDIAN CALCULATED FROM PUBLISHED COLLATERAL VALUES FROM MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY AIRCRAFT VALUE PUBLICATIONS BASED ON THE TYPE AND

AGE OF THE AIRCRAFT TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF AIRCRAFT. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, WE APPLY JUDGMENT BASED ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT, USUALLY WHEN THE FEATURES OR USE OF THE AIRCRAFT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE

MORE GENERIC AIRCRAFT ATTRIBUTES COVERED BY OUTSIDE PUBLICATIONS.

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND HELD FOR SALE OR

RE-LEASE

WE EVALUATE FOR IMPAIRMENT ASSETS UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR ASSETS HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW FROM THE ASSET MAY BE LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. WE

USE VARIOUS ASSUMPTIONS WHEN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED

64

TABLE OF CONTENTS

UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW, INCLUDING OUR INTENTIONS FOR HOW LONG WE WILL HOLD AN ASSET SUBJECT TO OPERATING LEASE BEFORE IT IS SOLD, THE EXPECTED FUTURE LEASE RATES, LEASE TERMS, RESIDUAL VALUE OF

THE ASSET, PERIODS IN WHICH THE ASSET MAY BE HELD IN PREPARATION FOR A FOLLOW-ON LEASE, MAINTENANCE COSTS, REMARKETING COSTS AND THE REMAINING ECONOMIC LIFE OF THE ASSET. WE STATE ASSETS HELD FOR SALE AT THE LOWER OF CARRYING VALUE OR FAIR VALUE

LESS COSTS TO SELL.

WHEN WE DETERMINE THAT IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE RECORDED IS THE EXCESS OF THE

CARRYING VALUE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES

WE RECORD THE POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF

CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES IN OUR PORTFOLIO IN A VALUATION ACCOUNT, THE BALANCE OF WHICH IS AN ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE BUT UNCONFIRMED LOSSES IN THE RECEIVABLES PORTFOLIO. THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES RELATES TO TWO COMPONENTS

OF RECEIVABLES: (A) SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY FOR IMPAIRMENT AND (B) ALL OTHER RECEIVABLES.

WE

DETERMINE A RECEIVABLE IS IMPAIRED WHEN, BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION AND EVENTS, IT IS PROBABLE THAT WE WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT, WITHOUT REGARD TO ANY SUBSEQUENT

RESTRUCTURINGS. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING COLLECTIBILITY INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO, A CUSTOMERS EXTENDED DELINQUENCY, REQUESTS FOR RESTRUCTURING AND FILINGS FOR BANKRUPTCY. WE DETERMINE A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCE BASED ON THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL.

WE REVIEW THE ADEQUACY OF THE ALLOWANCE

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REMAINING RECEIVABLES (AFTER EXCLUDING RECEIVABLES SUBJECT TO A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCE) BY ASSESSING BOTH THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AND THE APPLICABLE CUMULATIVE DEFAULT RATE. COLLATERAL EXPOSURE FOR A PARTICULAR RECEIVABLE

IS THE EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL. A RECEIVABLE WITH AN ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE IS CONSIDERED TO HAVE NO COLLATERAL EXPOSURE. THE APPLICABLE CUMULATIVE

DEFAULT RATE IS DETERMINED USING TWO COMPONENTS: CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS AND WEIGHTED AVERAGE REMAINING CONTRACT TERM. INTERNALLY ASSIGNED CREDIT RATINGS, OUR CREDIT QUALITY INDICATOR, ARE DETERMINED FOR EACH CUSTOMER IN THE PORTFOLIO. THOSE RATINGS

ARE UPDATED BASED UPON PUBLIC INFORMATION AND INFORMATION OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM OUR CUSTOMERS.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO AGREEMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS

THAT WOULD ENTITLE US TO LOOK BEYOND THE SPECIFIC COLLATERAL UNDERLYING THE RECEIVABLE FOR PURPOSES OF DETERMINING THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE. SHOULD THE PROCEEDS FROM THE SALE OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL ASSET RESULTING FROM A

DEFAULT CONDITION BE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR RECEIVABLE (CREATING A SHORTFALL CONDITION), THESE AGREEMENTS WOULD, FOR EXAMPLE, PERMIT US TO TAKE THE ACTIONS NECESSARY TO SELL OR RETAIN CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS IN WHICH THE

CUSTOMER HAS AN EQUITY INTEREST AND USE THE PROCEEDS TO COVER THE SHORTFALL.

EACH QUARTER WE REVIEW CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS, PUBLISHED HISTORICAL

CREDIT DEFAULT RATES FOR DIFFERENT RATING CATEGORIES, AND MULTIPLE THIRD-PARTY AIRCRAFT VALUE PUBLICATIONS AS A BASIS TO VALIDATE THE REASONABLENESS OF THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT ACTUAL RESULTS WILL NOT

DIFFER FROM ESTIMATES OR THAT THE CONSIDERATION OF THESE FACTORS IN THE FUTURE WILL NOT RESULT IN AN INCREASE OR DECREASE TO THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES.

WARRANTIES

IN CONJUNCTION WITH CERTAIN PRODUCT SALES, WE PROVIDE WARRANTIES THAT COVER FACTORS SUCH AS

NON-CONFORMANCE TO SPECIFICATIONS AND DEFECTS IN MATERIAL AND DESIGN. THE MAJORITY OF OUR WARRANTIES ARE ISSUED BY OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT. GENERALLY, AIRCRAFT SALES ARE ACCOMPANIED BY A THREE

65

TABLE OF CONTENTS

TO FOUR-YEAR STANDARD WARRANTY FOR SYSTEMS, ACCESSORIES, EQUIPMENT, PARTS, AND SOFTWARE MANUFACTURED BY US OR MANUFACTURED TO CERTAIN STANDARDS UNDER OUR AUTHORIZATION. THESE WARRANTIES ARE

INCLUDED IN THE PROGRAMS ESTIMATE AT COMPLETION. ON OCCASION WE HAVE MADE COMMITMENTS BEYOND THE STANDARD WARRANTY OBLIGATION TO CORRECT FLEET-WIDE MAJOR ISSUES OF A PARTICULAR MODEL, RESULTING IN ADDITIONAL ACCRUED WARRANTY EXPENSE.

WARRANTIES ISSUED BY OUR BDS SEGMENTS PRINCIPALLY RELATE TO SALES OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND WEAPONS HARDWARE AND ARE INCLUDED IN THE CONTRACT COST ESTIMATES. THESE SALES ARE GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A SIX TO TWELVE-MONTH WARRANTY PERIOD AND COVER

SYSTEMS, ACCESSORIES, EQUIPMENT, PARTS, AND SOFTWARE MANUFACTURED BY US TO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL SPECIFICATIONS. ESTIMATED COSTS RELATED TO STANDARD WARRANTIES ARE RECORDED IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE RELATED PRODUCT SALES OCCUR. THE WARRANTY LIABILITY

RECORDED AT EACH BALANCE SHEET DATE REFLECTS THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF MONTHS OF WARRANTY COVERAGE OUTSTANDING FOR PRODUCTS DELIVERED TIMES THE AVERAGE OF HISTORICAL MONTHLY WARRANTY PAYMENTS, AS WELL AS ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS FOR CERTAIN MAJOR WARRANTY

ISSUES THAT EXCEED A NORMAL CLAIMS LEVEL. ESTIMATED COSTS OF THESE ADDITIONAL WARRANTY ISSUES ARE CONSIDERED CHANGES TO THE INITIAL LIABILITY ESTIMATE.

SUPPLIER PENALTIES

WE RECORD AN ACCRUAL FOR SUPPLIER

PENALTIES WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS THAT MAKES IT PROBABLE THAT A SUPPLIER PENALTY WILL BE INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT IS REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. UNTIL AN EVENT OCCURS, WE FULLY ANTICIPATE ACCEPTING ALL PRODUCTS PROCURED UNDER PRODUCTION-RELATED CONTRACTS.

GUARANTEES

WE RECORD A LIABILITY IN OTHER

ACCRUED LIABILITIES FOR THE FAIR VALUE OF GUARANTEES THAT ARE ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002. FOR A RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEE WHERE WE RECEIVED A CASH PREMIUM, THE LIABILITY IS EQUAL TO THE CASH PREMIUM RECEIVED AT THE

GUARANTEES INCEPTION. FOR CREDIT AND PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES, THE LIABILITY IS EQUAL TO THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE EXPECTED LOSS. WE DETERMINE THE EXPECTED LOSS BY MULTIPLYING THE CREDITORS DEFAULT RATE BY THE GUARANTEE AMOUNT REDUCED BY

THE EXPECTED RECOVERY, IF APPLICABLE, FOR EACH FUTURE PERIOD THE CREDIT OR PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE WILL BE OUTSTANDING. IF AT INCEPTION OF A GUARANTEE, WE DETERMINE THERE IS A PROBABLE RELATED CONTINGENT LOSS, WE WILL RECOGNIZE A LIABILITY FOR THE

GREATER OF (A) THE FAIR VALUE OF THE GUARANTEE AS DESCRIBED ABOVE OR (B) THE PROBABLE CONTINGENT LOSS AMOUNT.

NET INCOME TAX PAYMENTS/(REFUNDS) WERE $360, ($198) AND $599 IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

OUR EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE WAS 26.5%, 22.9% AND 33.6% FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS HIGHER

IN 2010, THAN 2009, PRIMARILY BECAUSE PRE-TAX BOOK INCOME IN 2010 WAS HIGHER THAN IN 2009 AND BECAUSE OF AN INCOME TAX CHARGE OF $150 RECORDED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010 AS A RESULT OF THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AS

MODIFIED BY THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010. THIS WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A TAX BENEFIT OF $371 RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2010 AS A RESULT OF SETTLING THE 1998-2003 FEDERAL AUDIT. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER

IN 2009, THAN 2008, PRIMARILY BECAUSE TAX CREDITS SUCH AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT CREDITS REPRESENTED A HIGHER PROPORTION OF EARNINGS BEFORE TAXES DUE TO THE YEAR-OVER-YEAR REDUCTION IN EARNINGS. THE FOLLOWING IS A RECONCILIATION OF THE U.S.

NOT THAT SOME OR ALL OF THE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS WILL NOT BE REALIZED. INCLUDED IN THE NET DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009 ARE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS IN THE AMOUNTS OF $8,186 AND $7,226 RELATED TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE LOSS.

WE HAVE PROVIDED FOR U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES AND FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX IN THE AMOUNT OF $60 ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS NOT CONSIDERED PERMANENTLY

REINVESTED IN OUR NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES. WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED FOR U.S. DEFERRED INCOME TAXES OR FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAX ON THE REMAINDER OF UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FROM OUR NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES BECAUSE SUCH EARNINGS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE PERMANENTLY

REINVESTED AND IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE AMOUNT OF TAX THAT MAY BE PAYABLE UPON DISTRIBUTION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE

AMOUNT ACCRUED FOR THE PAYMENT OF INCOME TAX-RELATED INTEREST AND PENALTIES INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION WAS AS FOLLOWS: INTEREST OF $170 AND $271 AND PENALTIES OF $12 AND $14. THE AMOUNT OF INTEREST

(BENEFIT)/EXPENSE WAS ($105), $45 AND $43 FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. THE INTEREST BENEFIT RECORDED DURING 2010 WAS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE 1998-2003 FEDERAL AUDIT SETTLEMENT.

THE YEARS 2007-2008 ARE CURRENTLY BEING EXAMINED BY THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS), AND WE HAVE FILED APPEALS WITH THE IRS FOR 2004-2006. WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT

TO EXAMINATION IN MAJOR STATE AND INTERNATIONAL JURISDICTIONS FOR THE 2001-2010 TAX YEARS. WE BELIEVE APPROPRIATE PROVISIONS FOR ALL OUTSTANDING ISSUES HAVE BEEN MADE FOR ALL JURISDICTIONS AND ALL OPEN YEARS.

$1,074, $1,452 AND $1,171 WOULD AFFECT THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE, IF RECOGNIZED. THESE AMOUNTS ARE PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH U.S. FEDERAL TAX ISSUES SUCH AS THE TAX BENEFITS FROM THE FOREIGN SALES CORPORATION/EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME TAX RULES, THE

AMOUNT OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS CLAIMED, U.S. TAXATION OF FOREIGN EARNINGS, AND VALUATION ISSUES REGARDING CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTIONS CLAIMED. ALSO INCLUDED IN THESE AMOUNTS ARE ACCRUALS FOR DOMESTIC STATE TAX ISSUES SUCH AS THE

SEA LAUNCH

AT

DECEMBER 31, 2010, OTHER ASSETS INCLUDED $356 OF RECEIVABLES, PREVIOUSLY RECORDED AS ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, RELATED TO OUR FORMER INVESTMENT IN THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE WHICH BECAME PAYABLE BY CERTAIN SEA LAUNCH PARTNERS FOLLOWING SEA LAUNCHS

BANKRUPTCY FILING IN JUNE 2009. THE $356 INCLUDES $147 RELATED TO A PAYMENT MADE BY US UNDER A BANK GUARANTEE ON BEHALF OF SEA LAUNCH AND $209 RELATED TO LOANS WE MADE TO SEA LAUNCH. THE NET AMOUNTS OWED TO BOEING BY EACH OF THE PARTNERS ARE AS

FOLLOWS; S.P. KOROLEY ROCKET AND SPACE CORPORATION ENERGIA OF RUSSIA  $223, PO YUZHNOYE MASHINOSTROITELNY ZAVOD OF UKRAINE  $89 AND KB YUZHNOYE OF UKRAINE  $44.

ALTHOUGH EACH PARTNER IS CONTRACTUALLY OBLIGATED TO REIMBURSE US FOR ITS SHARE OF THE BANK GUARANTEE, THE RUSSIAN AND UKRAINIAN PARTNERS HAVE RAISED DEFENSES TO ENFORCEMENT AND CONTESTED OUR CLAIMS. ON

OCTOBER 19, 2009, WE FILED A NOTICE OF ARBITRATION WITH THE STOCKHOLM CHAMBER OF COMMERCE SEEKING REIMBURSEMENT FROM THE OTHER SEA LAUNCH PARTNERS OF THE $147 BANK GUARANTEE PAYMENT. ON OCTOBER 7, 2010, THE ARBITRATOR RULED THAT THE

STOCKHOLM CHAMBER OF COMMERCE LACKED JURISDICTION TO HEAR THE MATTER BUT DID NOT RESOLVE THE MERITS OF OUR CLAIM. WE FILED A NOTICE APPEALING THE ARBITRATORS RULING ON JANUARY 11, 2011. WE BELIEVE THE PARTNERS HAVE THE FINANCIAL

WHEREWITHAL TO PAY AND INTEND TO PURSUE VIGOROUSLY ALL OF OUR RIGHTS AND REMEDIES. IN THE EVENT WE ARE UNABLE TO SECURE REIMBURSEMENT OF $147 RELATED TO OUR PAYMENT UNDER THE BANK GUARANTEE AND $209 RELATED TO LOANS MADE TO SEA LAUNCH, WE COULD

INCUR ADDITIONAL PRE-TAX CHARGES OF UP TO $356.

WE ASSIGN INTERNAL CREDIT RATINGS FOR ALL CUSTOMERS AND DETERMINE THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF EACH CUSTOMER BASED UPON PUBLIC INFORMATION

AND INFORMATION OBTAINED DIRECTLY FROM OUR CUSTOMERS. WE UTILIZE THESE CREDIT RATINGS AS ONE OF THE FACTORS IN ASSESSING THE ADEQUACY OF OUR ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES. OUR RATING CATEGORIES ARE COMPARABLE TO THOSE USED BY THE MAJOR CREDIT

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT COMMITMENTS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNING DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS FOR THE SALE OF NEW AIRCRAFT (SALE AIRCRAFT), WE HAVE ENTERED INTO SPECIFIED-PRICE TRADE-IN

PORTION OF THESE COMMITMENTS WILL NOT BE EXERCISED BY CUSTOMERS.

THE PROBABILITY THAT TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WILL BE EXERCISED IS DETERMINED BY USING

BOTH QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION FROM VALUATION SOURCES AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES. THE PROBABILITY OF EXERCISE IS CONTINUALLY ASSESSED, TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION THE CURRENT ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS, WHICH CAN BE

TERMINATED BY MUTUAL CONSENT WITH THE CUSTOMER, MAY BE EXERCISED ONLY DURING THE PERIOD SPECIFIED IN THE AGREEMENT, AND REQUIRE ADVANCE NOTICE BY THE CUSTOMER. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT RELATED TO PROBABLE CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN

C-17

AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, OUR BACKLOG INCLUDED 6 C-17

AIRCRAFT CURRENTLY UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE U.S. AIR FORCE (USAF) AS WELL AS INTERNATIONAL ORDERS FOR 6 C-17 AIRCRAFT. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, WE HAVE APPROXIMATELY $620 OF INVENTORY EXPENDITURES AND POTENTIAL TERMINATION LIABILITIES TO SUPPLIERS

ASSOCIATED PRIMARILY WITH 10 AIRCRAFT FUNDED IN THE FISCAL YEAR 2010 (FY10) DEFENSE APPROPRIATIONS ACT WHICH ARE NOT CURRENTLY UNDER CONTRACT. THE PRESIDENTS FISCAL YEAR 2011 BUDGET ANNOUNCED DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010 DID NOT INCLUDE

ANY ADDITIONAL C-17 AIRCRAFT. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010 WE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO REDUCE THE PRODUCTION RATE FROM 15 PER YEAR TO 10 PER YEAR AND EXPECT THE TRANSITION TO BE COMPLETE BY MID-2011. THE LOWER PRODUCTION RATE IS INTENDED TO

BRIDGE THE GAP BETWEEN EXISTING ORDERS AND POTENTIAL FUTURE ORDERS. SHOULD ADDITIONAL ORDERS NOT MATERIALIZE, IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT WE WILL DECIDE IN 2011 TO END PRODUCTION OF THE C-17 AT A FUTURE DATE. WE ARE STILL EVALUATING THE FULL

FINANCIAL IMPACT OF A POTENTIAL PRODUCTION SHUT-DOWN, INCLUDING ANY RECOVERY THAT WOULD BE AVAILABLE FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. SUCH RECOVERY FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WOULD NOT INCLUDE THE COSTS INCURRED BY US RESULTING FROM OUR DIRECTION TO

SUPPLIERS TO BEGIN WORKING ON AIRCRAFT BEYOND THOSE CURRENTLY UNDER CONTRACT WITH THE USAF.

COMPANY OWNED LIFE INSURANCE

MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION INSURED ITS EXECUTIVES WITH COMPANY OWNED LIFE INSURANCE (COLI), WHICH ARE LIFE INSURANCE POLICIES WITH A CASH SURRENDER VALUE.

CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMERS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH SIGNING DEFINITIVE AGREEMENTS FOR THE SALE OF NEW AIRCRAFT. UNDER THESE COMMITMENTS, WE AGREED TO REPURCHASE THE SALE AIRCRAFT AT A SPECIFIED PRICE, GENERALLY 10 TO 15 YEARS AFTER DELIVERY OF THE SALE AIRCRAFT. OUR REPURCHASE OF

THE SALE AIRCRAFT IS CONTINGENT UPON A FUTURE, MUTUALLY ACCEPTABLE AGREEMENT FOR THE SALE OF ADDITIONAL NEW AIRCRAFT, AND THE SUBSEQUENT EXERCISE BY THE CUSTOMER OF ITS RIGHT TO SELL THE SALE AIRCRAFT TO US. THE REPURCHASE PRICE SPECIFIED IN

CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS IS GENERALLY LOWER THAN THE EXPECTED FAIR VALUE AT THE SPECIFIED REPURCHASE DATE. ESTIMATED PROCEEDS FROM COLLATERAL/RECOURSE IN THE TABLES ABOVE REPRESENT THE LOWER OF THE CONTRACTED REPURCHASE PRICE OR THE

EXPECTED FAIR VALUE OF EACH AIRCRAFT AT THE SPECIFIED REPURCHASE DATE.

INDEMNIFICATIONS TO ULA

WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ULA THROUGH

DECEMBER 31, 2020 AGAINST POTENTIAL NON-RECOVERABILITY AND NON-ALLOWABILITY OF $1,360 OF BOEING DELTA LAUNCH PROGRAM INVENTORY INCLUDED IN CONTRIBUTED ASSETS PLUS $1,860 OF INVENTORY SUBJECT TO AN INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT WHICH ENDS ON

MARCH 31, 2021. SINCE INCEPTION, ULA HAS CONSUMED $1,201 OF INVENTORY THAT WAS CONTRIBUTED BY US. ULA HAS MADE ADVANCE PAYMENTS OF $420 TO US AND WE HAVE RECORDED REVENUES AND COST OF SALES OF $166 UNDER THE INVENTORY SUPPLY AGREEMENT THROUGH

DECEMBER 31, 2010. ULA IS CONTINUING TO ASSESS THE FUTURE OF THE DELTA II PROGRAM BEYOND WHAT IS CURRENTLY ON CONTRACT. IN THE EVENT ULA IS UNABLE TO SELL ADDITIONAL DELTA II INVENTORY, OUR EARNINGS COULD BE REDUCED BY UP TO $70.

81

TABLE OF CONTENTS

WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY ULA AGAINST POTENTIAL LOSSES THAT ULA MAY INCUR IN THE EVENT ULA IS UNABLE TO OBTAIN CERTAIN

ADDITIONAL CONTRACT PRICING FROM THE USAF FOR FOUR SATELLITE MISSIONS. WE BELIEVE ULA IS ENTITLED TO ADDITIONAL CONTRACT PRICING. IN DECEMBER 2008, ULA SUBMITTED A CLAIM TO THE USAF TO RE-PRICE THE CONTRACT VALUE FOR TWO SATELLITE MISSIONS. IN MARCH

2009, THE USAF ISSUED A DENIAL OF THAT CLAIM AND IN JUNE 2009, ULA FILED AN APPEAL. DURING 2009, THE USAF EXERCISED ITS OPTION FOR A THIRD SATELLITE MISSION. DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, ULA SUBMITTED A CLAIM TO THE USAF TO RE-PRICE THE

CONTRACT VALUE OF THE THIRD MISSION. THE USAF DID NOT EXERCISE AN OPTION FOR A FOURTH MISSION PRIOR TO EXPIRATION. IF ULA IS UNSUCCESSFUL IN OBTAINING ADDITIONAL PRICING, WE MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A PORTION OF THE SHORTFALL AND MAY RECORD UP TO $283

IN PRE-TAX LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE THREE MISSIONS, REPRESENTING UP TO $261 FOR THE INDEMNIFICATION PAYMENT AND UP TO $22 FOR OUR PORTION OF ADDITIONAL CONTRACT LOSSES INCURRED BY ULA.

OTHER CREDIT GUARANTEES

WE HAVE ISSUED CREDIT GUARANTEES, PRINCIPALLY TO FACILITATE THE SALE AND/OR FINANCING OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO A

GUARANTEED PARTY IN THE EVENT THAT LEASE OR LOAN PAYMENTS ARE NOT MADE BY THE ORIGINAL LESSEE OR DEBTOR OR CERTAIN SPECIFIED SERVICES ARE NOT PERFORMED. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THESE GUARANTEES HAS BEEN EXTENDED ON BEHALF OF ORIGINAL LESSEES OR

DEBTORS WITH LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CREDIT GUARANTEES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY THE UNDERLYING COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND CERTAIN OTHER ASSETS. CURRENT OUTSTANDING CREDIT GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHIN THE NEXT TEN YEARS.

RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES

WE HAVE ISSUED VARIOUS RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES PRINCIPALLY TO FACILITATE THE SALE AND FINANCING OF CERTAIN

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. UNDER THESE GUARANTEES, WE ARE OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO THE GUARANTEED PARTY IF THE RELATED AIRCRAFT OR EQUIPMENT FAIR VALUES FALL BELOW A SPECIFIED AMOUNT AT A FUTURE TIME. THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE COLLATERALIZED PRINCIPALLY

BY THE UNDERLYING COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND EXPIRE WITHIN THE NEXT EIGHT YEARS.

OTHER INDEMNIFICATIONS

IN CONJUNCTION WITH OUR SALES OF THE ELECTRON DYNAMIC DEVICES, INC. AND ROCKETDYNE PROPULSION AND POWER BUSINESSES AND THE SALE OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

FACILITIES IN WICHITA, KANSAS AND TULSA AND MCALESTER, OKLAHOMA IN 2005, WE AGREED TO INDEMNIFY, FOR AN INDEFINITE PERIOD, THE BUYERS FOR COSTS RELATING TO PRE-CLOSING ENVIRONMENTAL CONTAMINATION AND CERTAIN OTHER ITEMS. AS IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO

ASSESS WHETHER THERE WILL BE DAMAGES IN THE FUTURE OR THE AMOUNTS THEREOF (IF ANY), WE CANNOT ESTIMATE THE MAXIMUM POTENTIAL AMOUNT OF FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER THESE INDEMNITIES. THEREFORE, NO LIABILITY HAS BEEN RECORDED. THERE HAVE BEEN NO CLAIMS

SUBMITTED TO DATE.

INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS

INDUSTRIAL REVENUE BONDS (IRBS) ISSUED BY THE CITY OF WICHITA ARE USED TO FINANCE THE PURCHASE AND/OR CONSTRUCTION OF REAL AND PERSONAL PROPERTY AT OUR WICHITA

SITE. TAX BENEFITS ASSOCIATED WITH IRBS INCLUDE A TEN-YEAR PROPERTY TAX ABATEMENT AND A SALES TAX EXEMPTION FROM THE KANSAS DEPARTMENT OF REVENUE. WE RECORD THE PROPERTY ON OUR CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION, ALONG WITH A CAPITAL

LEASE OBLIGATION TO REPAY THE PROCEEDS OF THE IRB. WE HAVE ALSO PURCHASED THE IRBS AND THEREFORE ARE THE BONDHOLDERS AS WELL AS THE BORROWER/LESSEE OF THE PROPERTY PURCHASED WITH THE IRB PROCEEDS.

THE CAPITAL LEASE OBLIGATION AND IRB ASSET ARE RECORDED NET IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE NET

ASSETS ASSOCIATED WITH THE CITY OF WICHITA IRBS WERE $822 AND $856.

NOTE 14  POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

ALMOST ALL OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE COVERED BY DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ALL NONUNION AND SOME UNION EMPLOYEES HIRED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2008. WE FUND OUR MAJOR PENSION PLANS THROUGH

TRUSTS. PENSION ASSETS ARE PLACED IN TRUST SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE PLANS PARTICIPANTS, AND ARE STRUCTURED TO MAINTAIN LIQUIDITY THAT IS SUFFICIENT TO PAY BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS AS WELL AS TO KEEP PACE OVER THE LONG TERM WITH THE GROWTH OF

OBLIGATIONS FOR FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS.

WE ALSO HAVE OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS (OPB) OTHER THAN PENSIONS WHICH CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE

COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, LIFE INSURANCE TO CERTAIN GROUPS OF RETIREES. RETIREE HEALTH CARE IS PROVIDED PRINCIPALLY UNTIL AGE 65 FOR APPROXIMATELY HALF THOSE RETIREES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR

HEALTH CARE COVERAGE. CERTAIN EMPLOYEE GROUPS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES COVERED BY MOST UNITED AUTO WORKERS BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, ARE PROVIDED LIFETIME HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.

THE FUNDED STATUS OF THE PLANS IS MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE PLAN ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE AND THE PROJECTED BENEFIT OBLIGATION (PBO). WE HAVE RECOGNIZED THE AGGREGATE OF ALL OVERFUNDED PLANS IN PENSION

PLAN ASSETS, NET, AND THE AGGREGATE OF ALL UNDERFUNDED PLANS IN EITHER ACCRUED RETIREE HEALTH CARE OR ACCRUED PENSION PLAN LIABILITY, NET. THE PORTION OF THE AMOUNT BY WHICH THE ACTUARIAL PRESENT VALUE OF BENEFITS INCLUDED IN THE PBO EXCEEDS THE

FAIR VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS, PAYABLE IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, IS REFLECTED IN OTHER ACCRUED LIABILITIES.

THE MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG, IMPROVEMENT AND MODERNIZATION ACT OF 2003 REDUCED OUR APBO BY $60 AND $497 AT DECEMBER 31, 2010

AND 2009. THESE REDUCTIONS/ACTUARIAL GAINS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE EXPECTED AVERAGE FUTURE SERVICE OF CURRENT EMPLOYEES.

PATIENT PROTECTION AND

AFFORDABLE CARE ACT, AS MODIFIED BY THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010 INCREASED OUR APBO BY $300 AT DECEMBER 31, 2010. THIS INCLUDES THE IMPACT OF THE EXCISE TAX ON HIGH COST HEALTH PLANS SCHEDULED TO BECOME PAYABLE

BEGINNING IN 2018. THIS INCREASE IS RECOGNIZED AS AN ACTUARIAL LOSS AND IS AMORTIZED OVER THE EXPECTED FUTURE SERVICE OF CURRENT EMPLOYEES.

ASSUMPTIONS

THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS, WHICH ARE THE

WEIGHTED AVERAGE FOR ALL PLANS, ARE USED TO CALCULATE THE BENEFIT OBLIGATION AT DECEMBER 31 OF EACH YEAR AND THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST FOR THE SUBSEQUENT YEAR.

THE DISCOUNT RATE FOR EACH PLAN IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE PLANS EXPECTED FUTURE BENEFIT PAYMENTS USING A YIELD CURVE DEVELOPED

FROM HIGH QUALITY BONDS THAT ARE RATED AS AA OR BETTER BY MOODYS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE. THE YIELD CURVE IS FITTED TO YIELDS DEVELOPED FROM BONDS AT VARIOUS MATURITY POINTS. BONDS WITH THE TEN PERCENT HIGHEST AND THE TEN PERCENT LOWEST

YIELDS ARE OMITTED. A PORTFOLIO OF ABOUT 400 BONDS IS USED TO CONSTRUCT THE YIELD CURVE. SINCE CORPORATE BOND YIELDS ARE GENERALLY NOT AVAILABLE AT MATURITIES BEYOND 30 YEARS, IT IS ASSUMED THAT SPOT RATES WILL REMAIN LEVEL BEYOND THAT 30-YEAR

POINT. THE PRESENT VALUE OF EACH PLANS BENEFITS IS CALCULATED BY APPLYING THE SPOT/DISCOUNT RATES TO PROJECTED BENEFIT CASH FLOWS. ALL BONDS ARE U.S. ISSUES, WITH A MINIMUM OUTSTANDING OF $50.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE PENSION FUNDS EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION IS DERIVED FROM A REVIEW OF ACTUAL HISTORICAL

RETURNS ACHIEVED BY THE PENSION TRUST AND ANTICIPATED FUTURE LONG-TERM PERFORMANCE OF INDIVIDUAL ASSET CLASSES. WHILE CONSIDERATION IS GIVEN TO RECENT TRUST PERFORMANCE AND HISTORICAL RETURNS, THE ASSUMPTION REPRESENTS A LONG-TERM, PROSPECTIVE

RETURN. THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS COMPONENT OF THE NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COST FOR THE UPCOMING PLAN YEAR IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE EXPECTED RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS ASSUMPTION AND THE MARKET-RELATED VALUE OF PLAN ASSETS (MRVA). SINCE OUR

ADOPTION OF THE ACCOUNTING STANDARD FOR PENSIONS IN 1987, WE HAVE DETERMINED THE MRVA BASED ON A FIVE-YEAR MOVING AVERAGE OF PLAN ASSETS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE MRVA IS APPROXIMATELY $450 GREATER THAN THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF ASSETS.

ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE AMOUNTS REPORTED FOR THE HEALTH CARE PLANS. TO DETERMINE THE

HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES WE LOOK AT A COMBINATION OF INFORMATION INCLUDING ONGOING CLAIMS COST MONITORING, ANNUAL STATISTICAL ANALYSES OF CLAIMS DATA, RECONCILIATION OF FORECAST CLAIMS AGAINST ACTUAL CLAIMS, REVIEW OF TREND ASSUMPTIONS OF OTHER

PLAN SPONSORS AND NATIONAL HEALTH TRENDS, AND ADJUSTMENTS FOR PLAN DESIGN CHANGES, WORKFORCE CHANGES, AND CHANGES IN PLAN PARTICIPANT BEHAVIOR. A ONE-PERCENTAGE-POINT CHANGE IN ASSUMED HEALTH CARE COST TREND RATES WOULD HAVE THE FOLLOWING EFFECT.

STRATEGY

THE OVERALL OBJECTIVE OF OUR PENSION ASSETS IS TO EARN A RATE OF RETURN OVER TIME TO SATISFY THE BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS OF THE PENSION PLANS AND TO MAINTAIN SUFFICIENT LIQUIDITY TO PAY BENEFITS AND ADDRESS OTHER CASH REQUIREMENTS OF THE

PENSION FUND. SPECIFIC INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES FOR OUR LONG-TERM INVESTMENT STRATEGY INCLUDE REDUCING THE VOLATILITY OF PENSION ASSETS RELATIVE TO PENSION LIABILITIES, ACHIEVING A COMPETITIVE, TOTAL INVESTMENT RETURN, ACHIEVING DIVERSIFICATION BETWEEN

AND WITHIN ASSET CLASSES AND MANAGING OTHER RISKS. INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES FOR EACH ASSET CLASS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON SPECIFIC RISKS AND INVESTMENT OPPORTUNITIES IDENTIFIED.

WE UPDATE OUR LONG-TERM, STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATIONS EVERY THREE-TO-FIVE YEARS. WE USE VARIOUS ANALYTICS TO DETERMINE THE OPTIMAL ASSET MIX AND CONSIDER PLAN LIABILITY CHARACTERISTICS, LIQUIDITY CHARACTERISTICS,

FUNDING REQUIREMENTS, EXPECTED RATES OF RETURN AND THE DISTRIBUTION OF RETURNS. WE IDENTIFY INVESTMENT BENCHMARKS FOR THE ASSET CLASSES IN THE STRATEGIC ASSET ALLOCATION THAT ARE MARKET-BASED AND INVESTABLE WHERE POSSIBLE.

ACTUAL ALLOCATIONS TO EACH ASSET CLASS VARY FROM TARGET ALLOCATIONS DUE TO PERIODIC INVESTMENT STRATEGY CHANGES, MARKET VALUE FLUCTUATIONS, THE LENGTH OF TIME IT

TAKES TO FULLY IMPLEMENT INVESTMENT ALLOCATION POSITIONS (SUCH AS PRIVATE EQUITY AND REAL ESTATE), AND THE TIMING OF BENEFIT PAYMENTS AND CONTRIBUTIONS. SHORT TERM INVESTMENTS AND EXCHANGE-TRADED DERIVATIVES ARE USED TO REBALANCE THE ACTUAL ASSET

ALLOCATION TO THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION. THE ASSET ALLOCATION IS MONITORED AND REBALANCED ON A MONTHLY BASIS.

FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ARE INVESTED BROADLY AND PRIMARILY IN LONG DURATION INSTRUMENTS. GLOBAL EQUITY SECURITIES ARE INVESTED BROADLY

IN U.S. AND NON-U.S. COMPANIES WHICH ARE IN VARIOUS INDUSTRIES AND COUNTRIES AND THROUGH A RANGE OF MARKET CAPITALIZATIONS.

REAL ESTATE AND REAL ASSETS

INCLUDE GLOBAL PRIVATE INVESTMENTS AND PUBLICLY TRADED INVESTMENTS (SUCH AS REITS IN THE CASE OF REAL ESTATE). REAL ESTATE INCLUDES BUT IS NOT LIMITED TO INVESTMENTS IN OFFICE, RETAIL, APARTMENT AND INDUSTRIAL PROPERTIES. REAL ASSETS INCLUDE BUT ARE

NOT LIMITED TO INVESTMENTS IN NATURAL RESOURCES (SUCH AS ENERGY, FARMLAND AND TIMBER) AND INFRASTRUCTURE. PRIVATE EQUITY INVESTMENT VEHICLES ARE PRIMARILY LIMITED PARTNERSHIPS (LPS) AND FUND-OF-FUNDS THAT MAINLY INVEST IN U.S. AND NON-U.S. LEVERAGED

BUYOUT, VENTURE CAPITAL AND SPECIAL SITUATION STRATEGIES.

GLOBAL STRATEGIES SEEK TO CAPITALIZE ON INEFFICIENCIES IDENTIFIED ACROSS DIFFERENT ASSET

CLASSES OR MARKETS, PRIMARILY USING LONG-SHORT POSITIONS IN DERIVATIVES AND PHYSICAL SECURITIES. HEDGE FUND STRATEGY TYPES INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED TO EVENT DRIVEN, RELATIVE VALUE, LONG-SHORT AND MARKET NEUTRAL. A WELL-DIVERSIFIED NUMBER OF

HEDGE FUNDS ARE HELD.

INVESTMENT MANAGERS ARE RETAINED FOR EXPLICIT INVESTMENT ROLES SPECIFIED BY CONTRACTUAL INVESTMENT GUIDELINES. CERTAIN INVESTMENT

MANAGERS ARE AUTHORIZED TO INVEST IN DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS EQUITY OR BOND FUTURES, SWAPS, OPTIONS AND CURRENCY FUTURES OR FORWARDS. DERIVATIVES ARE USED TO ACHIEVE THE DESIRED MARKET EXPOSURE OF A SECURITY OR AN INDEX, TRANSFER VALUE-ADDED

PERFORMANCE BETWEEN ASSET CLASSES, ACHIEVE THE DESIRED CURRENCY EXPOSURE, ADJUST PORTFOLIO DURATION OR REBALANCE THE TOTAL PORTFOLIO TO THE TARGET ASSET ALLOCATION.

AS A PERCENTAGE OF TOTAL PLAN ASSETS, DERIVATIVE NET NOTIONAL AMOUNTS WERE 9.8% AND 6.0% FOR FIXED INCOME, INCLUDING TO-BE-ANNOUNCED MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES AND TREASURY FORWARDS, AND NEGATIVE 0.2% AND 0.0% FOR

GLOBAL EQUITY AND CURRENCY OVERLAY AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009.

IN NOVEMBER 2009, THE COMPANY ELECTED TO CONTRIBUTE $1,500 OF OUR COMMON STOCK

TO THE PENSION FUND. AN INDEPENDENT FIDUCIARY WAS RETAINED TO MANAGE AND LIQUIDATE THE STOCK OVER TIME AT ITS DISCRETION. PLAN ASSETS INCLUDED $1,498 AND $1,581 OF OUR COMMON STOCK AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009.

RISK MANAGEMENT

IN MANAGING THE PLAN ASSETS, WE REVIEW AND MANAGE RISK ASSOCIATED WITH FUNDED STATUS RISK, INTEREST RATE RISK, MARKET RISK, COUNTERPARTY

RISK, LIQUIDITY RISK AND OPERATIONAL RISK. LIABILITY MANAGEMENT AND ASSET CLASS DIVERSIFICATION ARE CENTRAL TO OUR RISK MANAGEMENT APPROACH AND ARE INTEGRAL TO THE OVERALL INVESTMENT STRATEGY. FURTHER, ASSET CLASSES ARE CONSTRUCTED TO ACHIEVE

DIVERSIFICATION BY INVESTMENT STRATEGY, BY INVESTMENT MANAGER, BY INDUSTRY OR SECTOR AND BY HOLDING. INVESTMENT MANAGER GUIDELINES FOR PUBLICLY TRADED ASSETS ARE SPECIFIED AND ARE MONITORED REGULARLY THROUGH THE CUSTODIAN. CREDIT PARAMETERS FOR

COUNTERPARTIES HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR MANAGERS PERMITTED TO TRADE OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES.

OPB PLAN ASSETS

THE MAJORITY OF OPB PLAN ASSETS ARE INVESTED IN A BALANCED INDEX FUND WHICH IS COMPRISED OF APPROXIMATELY 60%

EQUITIES AND 40% DEBT SECURITIES. THE INDEX FUND IS VALUED USING A MARKET APPROACH BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICE OF AN IDENTICAL INSTRUMENT (LEVEL 1). THE EXPECTED RATE OF RETURN ON THESE ASSETS DOES NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE NET PERIODIC

BENEFIT COST.

CASH FLOWS

CONTRIBUTIONS

REQUIRED PENSION CONTRIBUTIONS UNDER THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA) AS WELL AS RULES GOVERNING FUNDING OF OUR NON-U.S. PENSION PLANS, ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL IN 2011. IN 2011 WE EXPECT TO MAKE DISCRETIONARY

CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR PLANS OF APPROXIMATELY $500. WE EXPECT THAT IF INTEREST RATES REMAIN AT THEIR CURRENT LEVELS, DISCOUNT RATES FOR ERISA DETERMINATIONS WILL LIKELY DECLINE IN FUTURE YEARS BECAUSE OF RETROSPECTIVE AVERAGING, AND AS A RESULT,

CONTRIBUTIONS IN FUTURE YEARS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE. WE EXPECT TO CONTRIBUTE APPROXIMATELY $15 TO OUR OPB PLANS IN 2011.

TERMINATION PROVISIONS

CERTAIN

OF THE PENSION PLANS PROVIDE THAT, IN THE EVENT THERE IS A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY WHICH IS NOT APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE PLANS ARE TERMINATED WITHIN FIVE YEARS THEREAFTER, THE ASSETS IN THE PLAN FIRST WILL BE USED TO

PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS REQUIRED BY ERISA, AND THEN ANY SURPLUS WILL BE USED TO FUND A TRUST TO CONTINUE PRESENT AND FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS IN OUR GROUP INSURANCE BENEFIT

PROGRAMS.

WE HAVE AN AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN PENSION PLANS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, SHOULD WE TERMINATE ANY OF THE

PLANS UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE PLANS ASSETS EXCEED THAT PLANS OBLIGATIONS, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL BE ENTITLED TO A FAIR ALLOCATION OF ANY OF THE PLANS ASSETS BASED ON PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE REIMBURSED UNDER U.S.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

401(K) PLANS

WE PROVIDE

CERTAIN DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS TO ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. THE PRINCIPAL PLANS ARE THE COMPANY-SPONSORED 401(K) PLANS. THE EXPENSE FOR THESE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS WAS $614, $591 AND $571 IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 15  SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION AND OTHER COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

OUR 2003 INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN, AS

AMENDED ON APRIL 27, 2009, PERMITS AWARDS OF INCENTIVE STOCK OPTIONS, NONQUALIFIED STOCK OPTIONS, RESTRICTED STOCK, STOCK UNITS, PERFORMANCE SHARES, PERFORMANCE UNITS AND OTHER INCENTIVES TO OUR EMPLOYEES, OFFICERS, CONSULTANTS AND INDEPENDENT

CONTRACTORS. THE AGGREGATE NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR STOCK AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE AMENDED PLAN WILL NOT EXCEED 80,000,000 AND NO MORE THAN AN AGGREGATE OF 16,000,000 SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS.

SHARES ISSUED AS A RESULT OF STOCK OPTION EXERCISES OR CONVERSION OF STOCK UNIT AWARDS WILL BE FUNDED OUT OF TREASURY SHARES, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THERE ARE

INSUFFICIENT TREASURY SHARES, IN WHICH CASE NEW SHARES WILL BE ISSUED. WE BELIEVE WE CURRENTLY HAVE ADEQUATE TREASURY SHARES TO MEET ANY REQUIREMENTS TO ISSUE SHARES DURING 2011.

THE EXPECTED VOLATILITY OF THE STOCK OPTIONS IS BASED ON A COMBINATION OF OUR HISTORICAL STOCK VOLATILITY AND THE VOLATILITY LEVELS

IMPLIED ON THE GRANT DATE BY ACTIVELY TRADED OPTION CONTRACTS ON OUR COMMON STOCK. WE DETERMINED THE EXPECTED TERM OF THE STOCK OPTION GRANTS TO BE SIX YEARS, CALCULATED USING THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE SEC STAFF

ACCOUNTING BULLETIN 110. WE USE THE SIMPLIFIED METHOD SINCE WE CHANGED THE VESTING TERMS, TAX TREATMENT AND THE RECIPIENTS OF OUR STOCK OPTIONS BEGINNING IN 2006 SUCH THAT WE BELIEVE OUR HISTORICAL DATA NO LONGER PROVIDES A REASONABLE

BASIS UPON WHICH TO ESTIMATE EXPECTED TERM.

RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS

ON FEBRUARY 22, 2010, WE GRANTED TO OUR EXECUTIVES 1,459,256 RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS (RSUS) AS PART OF OUR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM WITH A GRANT DATE FAIR VALUE OF $63.83 PER SHARE. ON FEBRUARY 23,

2009, WE GRANTED TO OUR EXECUTIVES 2,144,501 RSUS, WITH A FAIR VALUE OF $35.57 PER SHARE. THE RSUS VEST ON THE THIRD ANNIVERSARY OF THE GRANT DATE. IF AN EXECUTIVE TERMINATES EMPLOYMENT BECAUSE OF RETIREMENT, INVOLUNTARY LAYOFF, DISABILITY, OR

DEATH, THE EMPLOYEE (OR BENEFICIARY) WILL IMMEDIATELY VEST ON A PRORATION OF STOCK UNITS BASED ON ACTIVE EMPLOYMENT DURING THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. IN ALL OTHER CASES, THE RSUS WILL NOT VEST AND ALL RIGHTS TO THE STOCK UNITS WILL TERMINATE

COMPLETELY.

IN ADDITION TO RSUS AWARDED UNDER OUR LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PROGRAM, WE GRANT RSUS TO CERTAIN EXECUTIVES AND EMPLOYEES TO ENCOURAGE RETENTION

OR TO REWARD VARIOUS ACHIEVEMENTS. THESE RSUS ARE LABELED OTHER RESTRICTED STOCK UNITS IN THE TABLE BELOW. THE FAIR VALUES OF ALL RSUS ARE ESTIMATED USING THE AVERAGE STOCK PRICE ON THE DATE OF GRANT. STOCK UNITS SETTLE IN COMMON STOCK ON A

SHAREVALUE TRUST

THE SHAREVALUE TRUST, ESTABLISHED JULY 1, 1996, WAS A 14-YEAR IRREVOCABLE TRUST THAT HELD SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, RECEIVED DIVIDENDS, AND DISTRIBUTED TO EMPLOYEES THE APPRECIATION IN VALUE ABOVE A

3% PER ANNUM THRESHOLD RATE OF RETURN AT THE END OF EACH PERIOD. AT JUNE 30, 2010, THE APPRECIATION IN STOCK PRICE DID NOT EXCEED THE THRESHOLD, AND NO DISTRIBUTION WAS TRIGGERED FOR THE FINAL PERIOD OF THE TRUST. THIS WAS THE FINAL

INVESTMENT PERIOD OF THE TRUST, AND NO POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTIONS REMAIN. THE TRUST WAS TERMINATED EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2010 WITH THE 29,948,920 UNDISTRIBUTED SHARES RETURNED TO THE COMPANY. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OF $229 RELATED TO THE UNDISTRIBUTED

SHARES WERE WRITTEN OFF AT JUNE 30, 2010, OFFSET AGAINST PREVIOUS EXCESS TAX BENEFITS RECORDED IN ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL.

OTHER

COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS

PERFORMANCE AWARDS

PERFORMANCE AWARDS ARE CASH UNITS THAT PAY OUT BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF LONG-TERM FINANCIAL GOALS AT THE END OF A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. EACH UNIT HAS AN INITIAL

VALUE OF $100 DOLLARS PER UNIT. THE AMOUNT PAYABLE AT THE END OF THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD MAY BE ANYWHERE FROM $0 TO $200 DOLLARS PER UNIT, DEPENDING ON THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE AGAINST PLAN FOR A THREE-YEAR PERIOD. THE COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE HAS THE DISCRETION TO PAY THESE AWARDS IN CASH, STOCK, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH AFTER THE THREE-YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE, BASED ON THE ESTIMATED PERFORMANCE PAYOUT, IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD.

DURING 2010, 2009 AND 2008, WE GRANTED PERFORMANCE AWARDS TO OUR EXECUTIVES WITH THE PAYOUT BASED ON THE ACHIEVEMENT OF FINANCIAL GOALS FOR EACH

THREE-YEAR PERIOD FOLLOWING THE GRANT DATE. THE MINIMUM PAYOUT AMOUNT IS $0 AND THE MAXIMUM AMOUNT WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY OUT FOR THE 2010 AND 2009 PERFORMANCE AWARDS IS $250 AND $290. THERE WILL BE NO PAYOUT OF THE 2008 PERFORMANCE AWARDS.

DEFERRED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY HAS A

DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN WHICH PERMITS EXECUTIVES TO DEFER RECEIPT OF A PORTION OF THEIR SALARY, BONUS, AND CERTAIN OTHER INCENTIVE AWARDS. PRIOR TO MAY 1, 2006, EMPLOYEES WHO PARTICIPATED IN THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION PLAN COULD CHOOSE TO

DEFER IN EITHER AN INTEREST EARNING ACCOUNT OR A BOEING STOCK UNIT ACCOUNT. EFFECTIVE MAY 1, 2006, PARTICIPANTS CAN DIVERSIFY DEFERRED COMPENSATION AMONG 19 INVESTMENT FUNDS INCLUDING THE INTEREST EARNING ACCOUNT AND THE BOEING STOCK UNIT

ACCOUNT.

TOTAL EXPENSE/(INCOME) RELATED TO DEFERRED COMPENSATION WAS $112, $158 AND ($223) IN 2010, 2009 AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY. ADDITIONALLY, FOR

EMPLOYEES WHO ELECTED TO DEFER THEIR COMPENSATION IN STOCK UNITS PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2006, THE COMPANY MATCHED 25% OF THE DEFERRAL WITH ADDITIONAL STOCK UNITS. EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2006, ALL MATCHING CONTRIBUTIONS ARE SETTLED IN STOCK UPON

RETIREMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, THE DEFERRED COMPENSATION LIABILITY WHICH IS BEING MARKED TO MARKET WAS $1,149 AND $1,143.

NOTE 16  SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY

ON OCTOBER 29, 2007, THE BOARD APPROVED THE REPURCHASE OF UP TO $7,000 OF COMMON STOCK (THE PROGRAM). UNLESS TERMINATED EARLIER BY A BOARD RESOLUTION, THE PROGRAM WILL EXPIRE WHEN WE HAVE USED ALL AUTHORIZED

FUNDS FOR REPURCHASE. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, $3,610 IN SHARES MAY STILL BE PURCHASED UNDER THE PROGRAM.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009,

OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS HEDGE FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS PRINCIPALLY OCCURRING WITHIN FIVE YEARS IN THE FUTURE, WITH CERTAIN CONTRACTS HEDGING TRANSACTIONS UP TO 2021. WE USE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS SWAPS AND FIXED-PRICE PURCHASE

COMMITMENTS, TO HEDGE AGAINST POTENTIALLY UNFAVORABLE PRICE CHANGES FOR ITEMS USED IN PRODUCTION. THESE INCLUDE COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE ELECTRICITY AT FIXED PRICES THROUGH 2016.

WE HAVE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS WITH CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES. FOR FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF AT LEAST FIVE YEARS, OUR

DERIVATIVE COUNTERPARTIES COULD REQUIRE SETTLEMENT IF WE DEFAULT ON OUR FIVE-YEAR CREDIT FACILITY, EXPIRING NOVEMBER 2012. FOR COMMODITY CONTRACTS, OUR COUNTERPARTIES COULD REQUIRE COLLATERAL POSTED IN AN AMOUNT DETERMINED BY OUR CREDIT RATINGS. THE

FAIR VALUE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE AND COMMODITY CONTRACTS THAT HAVE CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES THAT ARE IN A NET LIABILITY POSITION AT DECEMBER 31, 2010 WAS $78. AT DECEMBER 31, 2010, THERE WAS NO COLLATERAL POSTED RELATED TO OUR

THE RELATED ASSET. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THERE WAS $9,865 OF FINANCING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER INCLUDING OPTIONS AND PROPOSED AS PART OF SALES CAMPAIGNS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 11, OF WHICH $8,490 RELATED TO CUSTOMERS WE BELIEVE

HAVE LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT.

BDS FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS

FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT WORK IS INHERENTLY UNCERTAIN AND SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT VARIABILITY IN ESTIMATES OF THE COST AND TIME REQUIRED TO COMPLETE THE WORK. SIGNIFICANT BDS FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS INCLUDE

AEW&C, P-8I, KC-767 INTERNATIONAL TANKER AND COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY SATELLITES. THE OPERATIONAL AND TECHNICAL COMPLEXITIES OF THESE CONTRACTS CREATE FINANCIAL RISK, WHICH COULD TRIGGER TERMINATION PROVISIONS, ORDER CANCELLATIONS OR OTHER

FINANCIALLY SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURE. CHANGES TO COST AND REVENUE ESTIMATES COULD ALSO RESULT IN LOWER MARGINS OR A MATERIAL CHARGE FOR REACH-FORWARD LOSSES IN 2011.

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS

SIGNIFICANT RISKS ARE INHERENT THROUGHOUT THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES AND NEW COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DERIVATIVES. CURRENTLY BOTH THE 787-8 AND 747-8 FREIGHTER ARE IN THE DEMANDING FLIGHT TEST AND CERTIFICATION STAGES OF PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT. THE 787-9 AND 747-8 INTERCONTINENTAL AIRPLANES ARE ALSO IN

DEVELOPMENT. THESE PROGRAMS REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENTS AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AS WELL AS INVESTMENTS IN WORKING CAPITAL AND INFRASTRUCTURE. THEY ALSO ENTAIL SIGNIFICANT COMMITMENTS TO CUSTOMERS AND SUPPLIERS AND REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL

INTERNAL RESOURCES. PERFORMANCE ISSUES ON THESE PROGRAMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS AND FINANCIAL POSITION IN 2011.

OTHER RISK

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, APPROXIMATELY 36%

OF OUR TOTAL WORKFORCE WAS REPRESENTED BY COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS AND APPROXIMATELY 1% OF OUR TOTAL WORKFORCE WAS REPRESENTED BY AGREEMENTS EXPIRING DURING 2011.

NOTE 19  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

THE FOLLOWING TABLES PRESENT OUR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS AND ARE CATEGORIZED USING THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY. THE FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY HAS THREE LEVELS BASED ON

THE RELIABILITY OF THE INPUTS USED TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE. LEVEL 1 REFERS TO FAIR VALUES DETERMINED BASED ON QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS. LEVEL 2 REFERS TO FAIR VALUES ESTIMATED USING SIGNIFICANT OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS AND

LEVEL 3 INCLUDES FAIR VALUES ESTIMATED USING SIGNIFICANT NON-OBSERVABLE INPUTS.

MONEY MARKET FUNDS AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE VALUED USING A MARKET APPROACH BASED ON THE QUOTED MARKET PRICES OF IDENTICAL

INSTRUMENTS. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE DEBT INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY VALUED USING A MARKET APPROACH BASED ON BENCHMARK YIELDS, REPORTED TRADES AND BROKER/DEALER QUOTES.

DERIVATIVES INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY, COMMODITY AND INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS. OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE VALUED USING AN INCOME APPROACH BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE FORWARD RATE LESS THE

CONTRACT RATE MULTIPLIED BY THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT. COMMODITY DERIVATIVES ARE VALUED USING AN INCOME APPROACH BASED ON THE PRESENT VALUE OF THE COMMODITY INDEX PRICES LESS THE CONTRACT RATE MULTIPLIED BY THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR

INTEREST RATE SWAPS IS DERIVED FROM A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS BASED ON THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT AND THE INTEREST RATE CURVE.

CERTAIN ASSETS HAVE

BEEN MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3). THE TABLE BELOW PRESENTS THE NONRECURRING LOSSES RECOGNIZED FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, AND THE CARRYING VALUE AND ASSET CLASSIFICATION OF

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND ACCOUNTS PAYABLE ARE BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RATES FOR LOANS OF THE SAME RISK AND

MATURITIES. THE FAIR VALUES OF OUR VARIABLE RATE NOTES RECEIVABLE THAT REPRICE FREQUENTLY APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING AMOUNTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF FIXED RATE NOTES RECEIVABLE ARE ESTIMATED USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW ANALYSIS USING INTEREST RATES

CURRENTLY OFFERED ON LOANS WITH SIMILAR TERMS TO BORROWERS OF SIMILAR CREDIT QUALITY. THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR DEBT IS BASED ON CURRENT MARKET YIELDS FOR OUR DEBT TRADED IN THE SECONDARY MARKET. THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES AND

CONTINGENT REPURCHASE COMMITMENTS ARE DETERMINED USING A BLACK FUTURES OPTIONS FORMULA AND INCLUDE SUCH ASSUMPTIONS AS THE EXPECTED VALUE OF THE AIRCRAFT ON THE SETTLEMENT DATE, VOLATILITY OF AIRCRAFT PRICES, TIME UNTIL SETTLEMENT AND THE RISK FREE

DISCOUNT RATE. THE FAIR VALUE OF THE CREDIT GUARANTEES IS ESTIMATED BASED ON THE EXPECTED CASH FLOWS OF THOSE COMMITMENTS, GIVEN THE CREDITORS PROBABILITY OF DEFAULT, AND DISCOUNTED USING THE RISK FREE RATE. WITH REGARD TO FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF FUTURE FINANCING COMMITMENTS BECAUSE THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF FUNDING THOSE COMMITMENTS ARE UNCERTAIN.

NOTE 20  LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS, CONTRACTS AND OTHER MATTERS ARE PENDING AGAINST US. POTENTIALLY MATERIAL CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS, FROM WHICH CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT OR HAVE RESULTED. SUCH PROCEEDINGS

INVOLVE OR COULD INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES, COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION AND/OR FORFEITURES. UNDER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, A COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS OPERATING DIVISIONS OR SUBDIVISIONS, CAN ALSO BE

SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, OR LOSE ITS EXPORT PRIVILEGES, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS. WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON CURRENT INFORMATION, THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH GOVERNMENT DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS, EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW. UNLESS OTHERWISE INDICATED BELOW, A RANGE OF LOSS ASSOCIATED WITH ANY INDIVIDUAL LEGAL PROCEEDING SET FORTH BELOW CANNOT BE

ESTIMATED.

A-12 LITIGATION

IN 1991, THE

DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY (THE NAVY) NOTIFIED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION (NOW MERGED INTO THE BOEING COMPANY) AND GENERAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION (TOGETHER, THE TEAM) THAT IT WAS TERMINATING FOR DEFAULT THE TEAMS CONTRACT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND

INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE A-12 AIRCRAFT.

100

TABLE OF CONTENTS

THE TEAM HAD FULL RESPONSIBILITY FOR PERFORMANCE OF THE CONTRACT AND BOTH CONTRACTORS ARE JOINTLY AND SEVERALLY LIABLE FOR ANY POTENTIAL LIABILITIES RESULTING FROM THE TERMINATION. THE TEAM FILED

A LEGAL ACTION TO CONTEST THE NAVYS DEFAULT TERMINATION, TO ASSERT ITS RIGHTS TO CONVERT THE TERMINATION TO ONE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND TO OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COSTS INCURRED ON THE A-12 CONTRACT BUT

NOT PAID TO DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, INVENTORIES INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $586 OF RECORDED COSTS ON THE A-12 CONTRACT, AGAINST WHICH WE HAVE ESTABLISHED A LOSS PROVISION OF $350. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVISION, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1990,

WAS BASED ON MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATIONS BELIEF, SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WOULD BE CONVERTED TO A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, AND THAT THE BEST ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE LOSS ON TERMINATION

FOR CONVENIENCE WAS $350.

ON AUGUST 31, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ISSUED A DECISION AFTER TRIAL UPHOLDING THE GOVERNMENTS

DEFAULT TERMINATION OF THE A-12 CONTRACT. IN 2003, THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT, FINDING THAT THE TRIAL COURT HAD APPLIED THE WRONG LEGAL STANDARD, VACATED THE TRIAL COURTS 2001 DECISION AND ORDERED THE CASE SENT BACK TO THE

TRIAL COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS. ON MAY 3, 2007, THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ISSUED A DECISION UPHOLDING THE GOVERNMENTS DEFAULT TERMINATION OF THE A-12 CONTRACT. WE FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL ON MAY 4, 2007 WITH THE COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT. ON JUNE 2, 2009, THE COURT OF APPEALS RENDERED AN OPINION AFFIRMING THE TRIAL COURTS 2007 DECISION SUSTAINING THE GOVERNMENTS DEFAULT TERMINATION. ON AUGUST 14, 2009, WE FILED A COMBINED

PETITION FOR PANEL REHEARING AND FOR REHEARING EN BANC IN THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT. ON NOVEMBER 24, 2009, THE COURT DENIED OUR COMBINED PETITION. ON SEPTEMBER 28, 2010, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT GRANTED OUR REQUEST TO

REVIEW THE DECISION OF THE COURT OF APPEALS. ORAL ARGUMENT WAS HELD BEFORE THE SUPREME COURT ON JANUARY 18, 2011. WE EXPECT THE U.S. SUPREME COURT TO RENDER A DECISION IN THE CASE IN 2011. ON DECEMBER 29, 2009, THE NAVY SENT LETTERS TO THE

TEAM REQUESTING PAYMENT OF $1,352 IN UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS, PLUS APPLICABLE INTEREST. ON FEBRUARY 19, 2010, THE NAVY SENT A LETTER CONFIRMING THAT IT WOULD NOT PURSUE PAYMENT FROM THE TEAM PENDING THE U.S. SUPREME COURTS REVIEW

OF THIS MATTER.

WE BELIEVE THAT THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT IS CONTRARY TO LAW AND FACT AND THAT THE LOSS PROVISION ESTABLISHED BY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS

CORPORATION IN 1990, WHICH WAS SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION FROM OUTSIDE COUNSEL, CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE REDUCTION IN VALUE OF A-12 NET CONTRACTS IN PROCESS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010. FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE A-12

LITIGATION WILL DEPEND ON THE OUTCOME OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS OR POSSIBLE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. IF AFTER REVIEWING THE COURT OF APPEALS DECISION, THE U.S. SUPREME COURT DETERMINES, CONTRARY TO OUR BELIEF, THAT A TERMINATION FOR

DEFAULT WAS APPROPRIATE, WE COULD INCUR AN ADDITIONAL LOSS OF UP TO $275, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF $236 OF REMAINING INVENTORY COSTS. IF THE COURTS FURTHER HOLD THAT A MONEY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE ENTERED AGAINST THE TEAM, WE COULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT UP TO ONE-HALF OF THE UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS OF $1,350 PLUS STATUTORY INTEREST FROM FEBRUARY 1991 (CURRENTLY TOTALING UP TO $1,530). IN THAT EVENT, OUR LOSS WOULD TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $1,711 IN PRE-TAX CHARGES. SHOULD,

HOWEVER, THE MARCH 31, 1998 JUDGMENT OF THE U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS IN FAVOR OF THE TEAM BE REINSTATED, WE COULD BE ENTITLED TO RECEIVE PAYMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $1,163, INCLUDING INTEREST FROM JUNE 26, 1991.

EMPLOYMENT AND BENEFITS LITIGATION

WE HAVE BEEN NAMED AS A

DEFENDANT IN TWO PENDING CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF KANSAS, EACH RELATED TO THE 2005 SALE OF OUR FORMER WICHITA FACILITY TO SPIRIT AEROSYSTEMS, INC. (SPIRIT). THE FIRST ACTION INVOLVES ALLEGATIONS THAT

SPIRITS HIRING DECISIONS FOLLOWING THE SALE WERE TAINTED BY AGE DISCRIMINATION, VIOLATED THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT (ERISA), VIOLATED OUR COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, AND CONSTITUTED RETALIATION. THE CASE WAS BROUGHT IN

2006 AS A CLASS ACTION ON BEHALF OF INDIVIDUALS NOT HIRED BY SPIRIT. DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2010, THE COURT GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF BOEING AND SPIRIT ON ALL CLASS ACTION CLAIMS.

101

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2010, PLAINTIFFS FILED A MOTION SEEKING RECONSIDERATION OF THE SUMMARY JUDGMENT DECISION.

THE SECOND ACTION, INITIATED IN 2007, ALLEGES COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENT BREACHES AND ERISA VIOLATIONS IN CONNECTION WITH ALLEGED FAILURES TO PROVIDE BENEFITS TO CERTAIN FORMER EMPLOYEES OF THE WICHITA

FACILITY. DISCOVERY IN THE CASE IS ONGOING. SPIRIT HAS AGREED TO INDEMNIFY BOEING FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES IN THE FIRST ACTION, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CLAIMS ARISING FROM EMPLOYMENT ACTIONS PRIOR TO JANUARY 1, 2005. WHILE SPIRIT HAS ACKNOWLEDGED A

LIMITED INDEMNIFICATION OBLIGATION IN THE SECOND ACTION, WE BELIEVE THAT SPIRIT IS OBLIGATED TO INDEMNIFY BOEING FOR ANY AND ALL LOSSES IN THE SECOND ACTION.

ON OCTOBER 13, 2006, WE WERE NAMED AS A DEFENDANT IN A LAWSUIT FILED IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS. PLAINTIFFS, SEEKING TO REPRESENT A CLASS OF SIMILARLY SITUATED

PARTICIPANTS AND BENEFICIARIES IN THE BOEING COMPANY VOLUNTARY INVESTMENT PLAN (THE VIP), ALLEGED THAT FEES AND EXPENSES INCURRED BY THE VIP WERE AND ARE UNREASONABLE AND EXCESSIVE, NOT INCURRED SOLELY FOR THE BENEFIT OF THE VIP AND ITS

PARTICIPANTS, AND WERE UNDISCLOSED TO PARTICIPANTS. THE PLAINTIFFS FURTHER ALLEGED THAT DEFENDANTS BREACHED THEIR FIDUCIARY DUTIES IN VIOLATION OF §502(A)(2) OF ERISA, AND SOUGHT INJUNCTIVE AND EQUITABLE RELIEF PURSUANT TO §502(A)(3) OF

ERISA. DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2010, THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS GRANTED A STAY OF TRIAL PROCEEDINGS IN THE DISTRICT COURT PENDING RESOLUTION OF AN APPEAL MADE BY BOEING IN 2008 TO THE CASES CLASS CERTIFICATION ORDER. ON JANUARY

21, 2011, THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT REVERSED THE DISTRICT COURTS CLASS CERTIFICATION ORDER AND DECERTIFIED THE CLASS. THE SEVENTH CIRCUIT REMANDED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.

BSSI/ICO LITIGATION

ON AUGUST 16, 2004, OUR

WHOLLY-OWNED SUBSIDIARY, BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS INTERNATIONAL, INC. (BSSI) FILED A COMPLAINT FOR DECLARATORY RELIEF AGAINST ICO GLOBAL COMMUNICATIONS (OPERATIONS), LTD. (ICO) IN LOS ANGELES COUNTY SUPERIOR COURT SEEKING A DECLARATION THAT

ICOS PRIOR TERMINATION OF TWO CONTRACTS FOR CONVENIENCE EXTINGUISHED ALL CLAIMS BETWEEN THE PARTIES. ON SEPTEMBER 16, 2004, ICO FILED A CROSS-COMPLAINT ALLEGING BREACH OF CONTRACT, ECONOMIC DURESS, FRAUD, UNFAIR COMPETITION, AND OTHER

CLAIMS. ICO ADDED THE BOEING COMPANY AS A DEFENDANT IN OCTOBER 2005 TO SOME OF THESE CLAIMS AND FOR INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT AND MISAPPROPRIATION OF TRADE SECRETS. ON JANUARY 13, 2006, BSSI FILED A CROSS-COMPLAINT AGAINST ICO, ICO GLOBAL

COMMUNICATIONS (HOLDINGS) LIMITED (ICO HOLDINGS), ICOS PARENT, AND EAGLE RIVER INVESTMENTS, LLC, PARENT OF BOTH ICO AND ICO HOLDINGS, ALLEGING FRAUD AND OTHER CLAIMS. THE TRIAL COMMENCED ON JUNE 19, 2008, WITH ICO SEEKING TO RECOVER

APPROXIMATELY $2,000 IN DAMAGES, INCLUDING ALL MONIES PAID TO BSSI AND BOEING LAUNCH SERVICES, PLUS PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND OTHER UNSPECIFIED DAMAGES AND RELIEF.

ON OCTOBER 21, 2008, THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT AWARDING ICO COMPENSATORY DAMAGES OF $371 PLUS INTEREST, BASED UPON FINDINGS OF CONTRACT BREACH, FRAUD AND INTERFERENCE WITH CONTRACT. ON OCTOBER 31, 2008,

THE JURY AWARDED ICO PUNITIVE DAMAGES OF $236. ON JANUARY 2, 2009, THE COURT ENTERED JUDGMENT FOR ICO IN THE AMOUNT OF $631 WHICH INCLUDED $24 IN PREJUDGMENT INTEREST.

ON FEBRUARY 26, 2009 THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED IN PART AND DENIED IN PART POST-TRIAL MOTIONS WE FILED SEEKING TO SET ASIDE THE VERDICT. AS A RESULT, ON MARCH 3, 2009, THE COURT ENTERED AN AMENDED JUDGMENT

FOR ICO IN THE AMOUNT OF $604, WHICH INCLUDED $371 IN COMPENSATORY DAMAGES, $207 IN PUNITIVE DAMAGES AND $26 IN PREJUDGMENT INTEREST. POST-JUDGMENT INTEREST WILL ACCRUE ON THE JUDGMENT AT THE RATE OF 10% PER YEAR (SIMPLE INTEREST) FROM

JANUARY 2, 2009. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, THE AMOUNT OF POST-JUDGMENT INTEREST TOTALED $121.

WE FILED A NOTICE OF APPEAL AND ICO FILED A

NOTICE OF CROSS-APPEAL IN MARCH 2009. AS OF NOVEMBER 1, 2010, THE APPEALS WERE FULLY BRIEFED. NO DATE HAS BEEN SET BY THE COURT FOR ARGUMENT. WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE SUBSTANTIAL ARGUMENTS ON APPEAL, WHICH WE INTEND TO PURSUE VIGOROUSLY.

102

TABLE OF CONTENTS

BSSI/TELESAT CANADA

ON NOVEMBER 9, 2006, TELESAT CANADA (TELESAT) AND A GROUP OF ITS INSURERS SERVED BSSI WITH AN ARBITRATION DEMAND ALLEGING BREACH OF CONTRACT, GROSS NEGLIGENCE AND WILLFUL MISCONDUCT IN CONNECTION WITH THE

CONSTRUCTIVE TOTAL LOSS OF ANIK F1, A MODEL 702 SATELLITE MANUFACTURED BY BSSI. TELESAT AND ITS INSURERS INITIALLY SOUGHT OVER $385 IN DAMAGES AND $10 IN LOST PROFITS, BUT REVISED THEIR DEMAND TO $263. BSSI HAS ASSERTED A COUNTERCLAIM AGAINST

TELESAT FOR $6 IN UNPAID PERFORMANCE INCENTIVE PAYMENTS AND ALSO A $180 CONTINGENT COUNTERCLAIM ON THE THEORY THAT ANY ULTIMATE AWARD TO REIMBURSE THE INSURERS FOR THEIR PAYMENTS TO TELESAT COULD ONLY RESULT FROM TELESATS BREACH OF ITS

CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATION TO OBTAIN A FULL WAIVER OF SUBROGATION RIGHTS BARRING RECOURSE AGAINST BSSI. WE BELIEVE THAT THE CLAIMS ASSERTED BY TELESAT AND ITS INSURERS LACK MERIT, BUT WE HAVE NOTIFIED OUR INSURANCE CARRIERS OF THE DEMAND. THE

ARBITRATION WAS STAYED PENDING AN APPLICATION BY TELESAT TO THE ONTARIO SUPERIOR COURT ON A PRELIMINARY ISSUE. ON JULY 16, 2010, THE COURT DENIED TELESATS REQUEST TO EXCLUDE CERTAIN EVIDENCE, BUT GRANTED ITS ALTERNATIVE REQUEST TO REMOVE

THE CHAIRPERSON FROM THE ARBITRATION PANEL. A NEW CHAIRPERSON WAS APPOINTED ON AUGUST 19, 2010, AND THE STAY HAS BEEN LIFTED. THE ARBITRATION HEARING HAS BEEN RESCHEDULED FOR APRIL 16, 2012.

ON APRIL 26, 2007, A GROUP OF OUR INSURERS FILED A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT ACTION IN THE CIRCUIT COURT OF COOK COUNTY, ILLINOIS ASSERTING CERTAIN DEFENSES TO

COVERAGE AND REQUESTING A DECLARATION OF THEIR OBLIGATION UNDER OUR INSURANCE AND REINSURANCE POLICIES RELATING TO THE TELESAT ANIK F1 ARBITRATION. ON JUNE 12, 2008, THE COURT GRANTED THE INSURERS MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT, CONCLUDING

THAT OUR INSURANCE POLICY EXCLUDED THE KINDS OF LOSSES ALLEGED BY TELESAT. ON JANUARY 16, 2009, THE COURT GRANTED BOEINGS MOTION FOR RECONSIDERATION, RULING IN FAVOR OF BOEING TO REQUIRE THE INSURERS TO PROVIDE INSURANCE COVERAGE TO

DEFEND THE CLAIM. THE CASE HAS BEEN STAYED PENDING COMPLETION OF THE UNDERLYING ARBITRATION.

CIVIL SECURITIES LITIGATION

ON NOVEMBER 13, 2009, PLAINTIFF SHAREHOLDERS FILED A PUTATIVE SECURITIES FRAUD CLASS ACTION AGAINST THE BOEING COMPANY AND TWO OF OUR SENIOR EXECUTIVES IN

FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN CHICAGO. THIS LAWSUIT ARISES FROM OUR JUNE 2009 ANNOUNCEMENT THAT THE FIRST FLIGHT OF THE 787 DREAMLINER WOULD BE POSTPONED DUE TO A NEED TO REINFORCE AN AREA WITHIN THE SIDE-OF-BODY SECTION OF THE AIRCRAFT. PLAINTIFFS

CONTEND THAT WE WERE AWARE BEFORE JUNE 2009 THAT THE FIRST FLIGHT COULD NOT TAKE PLACE AS SCHEDULED DUE TO ISSUES WITH THE SIDE-OF-BODY SECTION OF THE AIRCRAFT, AND THAT OUR DETERMINATION NOT TO ANNOUNCE THIS DELAY EARLIER RESULTED IN AN ARTIFICIAL

INFLATION OF OUR STOCK PRICE FOR A MULTI-WEEK PERIOD IN MAY AND JUNE 2009. IN MARCH 2010, WE FILED A MOTION TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT FOR FAILURE TO STATE A COGNIZABLE CLAIM, AND, ON MAY 26, 2010, THE COURT GRANTED THE MOTION AND DISMISSED THE

COMPLAINT IN ITS ENTIRETY. ON JUNE 22, 2010, THE COURT ACCEPTED THE PLAINTIFFS AMENDED COMPLAINT, WHICH WE MOVED TO DISMISS. ON AUGUST 10, 2010, THE COURT DENIED THE MOTION AND ON AUGUST 30, 2010, WE ANSWERED THE AMENDED

COMPLAINT. ON SEPTEMBER 24, 2010, WE MOVED TO STRIKE THE PORTIONS OF THE AMENDED COMPLAINT ATTRIBUTED TO A CONFIDENTIAL SOURCE AND TO DISMISS THE COMPLAINT WITH PREJUDICE. ON OCTOBER 14, 2010, THE COURT DENIED OUR MOTIONS. ON

DECEMBER 10, 2010, WE MOVED FOR RECONSIDERATION OF THE COURTS ORDER DENYING OUR MOTION TO DISMISS. DISCOVERY HAS COMMENCED.

IN ADDITION,

PLAINTIFF SHAREHOLDERS HAVE FILED THREE SIMILAR SHAREHOLDER DERIVATIVE LAWSUITS CONCERNING THE FLIGHT SCHEDULE FOR THE 787 DREAMLINER THAT CLOSELY TRACK THE ALLEGATIONS IN THE PUTATIVE CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT. TWO OF THE SUITS WERE FILED IN ILLINOIS

STATE COURT AND HAVE BEEN CONSOLIDATED. THE REMAINING DERIVATIVE SUIT WAS FILED IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN CHICAGO. NO BRIEFING OR DISCOVERY HAS YET TAKEN PLACE IN ANY OF THESE LAWSUITS. WE BELIEVE THE ALLEGATIONS IN ALL OF THESE CASES ARE WITHOUT

MERIT, AND WE INTEND TO CONTEST THE CASES VIGOROUSLY.

YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010. OUR AUDITS ALSO INCLUDED THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE LISTED IN THE INDEX AT ITEM 15(A) 2. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE

COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN

IN OUR OPINION, SUCH CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE FINANCIAL POSITION OF THE BOEING COMPANY AND

SUBSIDIARIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010 AND 2009, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010, IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE

THE BOEING COMPANY

CHICAGO, ILLINOIS

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF THE BOEING COMPANY AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING

ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING MANAGEMENTS REPORT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND

PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING,

ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES.

WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED

BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE

REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN

ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE

POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2010, BASED ON THE

CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2010 OF THE COMPANY AND OUR REPORT DATED FEBRUARY 9, 2011 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENT SCHEDULE.
