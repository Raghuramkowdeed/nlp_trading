PAGES 72-74 OF THE COMPANY'S 2000 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND ARE

INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE.

ON OCTOBER 6, 2000, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED HUGHES SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

BUSINESSES AND RELATED OPERATIONS. THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES WILL BE OPERATED

UNDER THE NAME OF BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS (BSS). BSS PROVIDES SPACE-BASED

WITH RESPECT TO THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT, THE COMPANY IS A LEADING

PRODUCER OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND OFFERS A FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL JETLINERS

DESIGNED TO MEET A BROAD SPECTRUM OF PASSENGER AND CARGO REQUIREMENTS OF

DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN AIRLINES. THIS FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT CURRENTLY

INCLUDES THE 717, 737 CLASSIC, 737 NEXT-GENERATION, MD-80, MD-90 AND 757

STANDARD-BODY MODELS AND THE 767, MD-11, 777 AND 747 WIDE-BODY MODELS. FINAL

DELIVERIES OF THE MD-80, MD-90 AND 737 CLASSIC AIRCRAFT OCCURRED IN 2000. FINAL

DELIVERY OF THE MD-11 AIRCRAFT WILL OCCUR IN EARLY 2001.

THE WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT IS PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY

LONG-TERM TRENDS IN AIRLINE PASSENGER TRAFFIC. THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS UNDERLYING

LONG-TERM TRAFFIC GROWTH ARE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH, BOTH IN DEVELOPED AND

EMERGING COUNTRIES, AND POLITICAL STABILITY. DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT IS FURTHER INFLUENCED BY AIRLINE INDUSTRY PROFITABILITY, WORLD TRADE

POLICIES, GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED

UPON AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, AND PRICE AND OTHER COMPETITIVE

FACTORS.

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT ARE NORMALLY SOLD ON A FIRM FIXED-PRICE BASIS WITH AN

INDEXED PRICE ESCALATION CLAUSE. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO DELIVER JET AIRCRAFT

ON SCHEDULE IS DEPENDENT UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXECUTION OF

INTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS, AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, PERFORMANCE OF

SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS, AND REGULATORY CERTIFICATION. THE INTRODUCTION OF

NEW COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND MAJOR DERIVATIVES INVOLVES INCREASED RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND CERTIFICATION SCHEDULES.

THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT SALES ARE SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITION,

INCLUDING FOREIGN COMPANIES THAT ARE NATIONALLY OWNED OR SUBSIDIZED. TO MEET

COMPETITION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A PROGRAM DIRECTED TOWARD CONTINUALLY

ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE AND CAPABILITY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND HAS A FAMILY OF

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT TO MEET VARIED AND CHANGING AIRLINE REQUIREMENTS.

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE CURRENT MODELS, AND

ASSESSES THE MARKETPLACE TO ENSURE THAT ITS FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT IS

WELL POSITIONED TO MEET FUTURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. THE

FUNDAMENTAL STRATEGY IS TO MAINTAIN A BROAD PRODUCT LINE RESPONSIVE TO CHANGING

MARKET CONDITIONS BY MAXIMIZING COMMONALITY AMONG THE BOEING FAMILY OF

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE TO LEAD

THE INDUSTRY IN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BY OFFERING PRODUCTS WITH THE HIGHEST

STANDARDS OF QUALITY, SAFETY, TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE, ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND IN-

SERVICE SUPPORT.

THE MAJOR FOCUS OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES OVER THE PAST

THREE YEARS HAS BEEN THE 767-400ER, THE NEXT-GENERATION 737 FAMILY OF SHORT-TO-

MEDIUM JETLINERS (737-600/700/800/900 MODELS), THE 717 PROGRAM, THE 757-300

DERIVATIVE, AND THE 777-300 DERIVATIVE. INITIAL DELIVERY OF THE 767-400ER, A

STRETCHED VERSION OF THE 767-300ER CAPABLE OF CARRYING OVER 300 PASSENGERS IN A

TWO-CLASS CONFIGURATION, OCCURRED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2000. THE

CERTIFICATION AND INITIAL DELIVERIES OF THE 737-700 OCCURRED IN 1997. INITIAL

DELIVERY OF THE 737-800, A LARGER VERSION, OCCURRED IN EARLY 1998, AND INITIAL

DELIVERY OF THE 737-600, THE SMALLEST VERSION, OCCURRED IN LATE 1998. THE 737-

900, THE LONGEST MEMBER OF THE NEXT-GENERATION 737 FAMILY, RECEIVED ITS INITIAL

ORDER IN LATE 1997 WITH FIRST DELIVERY SCHEDULED FOR 2001. THE NEXT-GENERATION

737 MODELS ARE ALSO BEING USED BY BOEING BUSINESS JETS, A COLLABORATION BETWEEN

THE COMPANY AND GENERAL ELECTRIC, TO PURSUE THE BUSINESS TRAVEL MARKET.

CERTIFICATION AND FIRST DELIVERY OF THE BOEING BUSINESS JET OCCURRED IN LATE

1998. FIRST DELIVERY OF THE 717 OCCURRED IN SEPTEMBER 1999. INITIAL DELIVERY OF

3

4

THE 757-300, WITH APPROXIMATELY 20% MORE SEATING AND ABOUT 10% LOWER SEAT-MILE

OPERATING COSTS THAN THE -200 MODEL, OCCURRED IN 1999. THE INCREASED-CAPACITY

VERSION 777-300 INITIAL DELIVERY OCCURRED IN 1998. CERTIFICATION AND FIRST

DELIVERY OF THE 777-300ER AND 777-200LR IS SCHEDULED FOR 2003 AND 2004,

RESPECTIVELY.

NEW PRODUCTS UNDER CONSIDERATION INCLUDE LARGER AND LONGER-RANGE VERSIONS OF

THE 777. SCHEDULED TO ENTER INTO SERVICE IN THE SPRING OF 2004, A LONGER-RANGE

767-400ER WILL SEAT 245 PASSENGERS BUT WILL HAVE A RANGE 600 MILES LONGER THAN

THE CURRENT VERSION. SUFFICIENT MARKET DEMAND HAS NOT DEVELOPED TO JUSTIFY

COMMITTING THE VERY SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT LEVELS REQUIRED TO DEVELOP EITHER AN

ALL-NEW VERY LARGE AIRCRAFT OR SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER VERSIONS OF THE 747. THE

TIMING OF A DECISION TO PROCEED WITH A 747 DERIVATIVE AIRCRAFT AND THE

DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULE DEPEND ON CUSTOMER DEMAND AND THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO

ACHIEVE FAVORABLE LONG-TERM FINANCIAL RETURNS ON THE SUBSTANTIAL DEVELOPMENT

COSTS THAT WOULD BE REQUIRED.

THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITION OF THE DEFENSE AND SPACE UNITS OF ROCKWELL IN 1996;

THE MERGER WITH MCDONNELL DOUGLAS IN 1997; AND OTHER ACQUISITIONS, SUCH AS THE

HUGHES SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES, HAVE CREATED A LARGE AND DIVERSIFIED

GROUP OF PROGRAMS IN INFORMATION, SPACE AND DEFENSE SYSTEMS. THE MAJOR TRENDS

THAT SHAPE THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES SEGMENT

AND THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT BUT RELATIVELY FLAT

U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE AND SPACE BUDGETS; RAPID EXPANSION OF INFORMATION AND

COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES, THE NEED FOR LOW COST, ASSURED ACCESS TO SPACE, AND

A CONVERGENCE OF MILITARY, CIVIL AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, PRINCIPALLY THROUGH THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) AND

NASA, REMAINS THE PRIMARY CUSTOMER IN THE AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES AND SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS SEGMENTS. DOD PROCUREMENT FUNDING LEVELS ARE EXPECTED TO

MODERATELY INCREASE AS MODERNIZATION OF USED AND RAPIDLY AGING EQUIPMENT BECOME

AN IMPORTANT ISSUE WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. PRIVATIZATION OF SOME GOVERNMENT

ACTIVITIES HAS OPENED AREAS OF GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY IN AEROSPACE SUPPORT. THE

COMPANY'S DOD PROGRAMS ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAIN FUTURE FUNDING LEVELS, WHICH CAN

RESULT IN THE STRETCH-OUT OR TERMINATION OF SOME PROGRAMS. NASA'S BUDGET IS

EXPECTED TO REMAIN RELATIVELY FLAT OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL YEARS.

THE COMPANY'S MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES AND SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE HIGHLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN NATIONAL PRIORITIES AND

U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE AND SPACE BUDGETS. THE PRINCIPAL CONTRIBUTORS TO 2000

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES SEGMENT REVENUES INCLUDED THE C-17, F-15, F/A-18

C/D, F/A-18 E/F, AH-64 APACHE, T-45 GOSHAWK TRAINING SYSTEM, AV-8B HARRIER, THE

HARPOON MISSILE ALONG WITH AEROSPACE SUPPORT. THE PRINCIPAL CONTRIBUTORS TO 2000

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT REVENUES INCLUDED THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE

STATION, NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE LEAD SYSTEMS INTEGRATOR (NMD LSI), E-3 AWACS

(AIRBORNE WARNING AND CONTROL SYSTEM) UPDATES AND 767 AWACS, SPACE SHUTTLE

FLIGHT OPERATIONS AND DELTA SPACE LAUNCH SERVICES. CLASSIFIED PROJECTS FOR THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT ALSO CONTINUED TO CONTRIBUTE TO BOTH SEGMENTS' REVENUES.

IN RECENT YEARS, A SIGNIFICANT PERCENTAGE OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES

SEGMENT BUSINESS HAS BEEN IN DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT-

TYPE CONTRACTS, WHICH GENERALLY HAVE LOWER PROFIT MARGINS THAN FIXED-PRICE-TYPE

CONTRACTS. CURRENT MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE F-22 RAPTOR, JOINT

STRIKE FIGHTER, V-22 OSPREY TILTROTOR AIRCRAFT, THE RAH-66 COMANCHE HELICOPTER,

AND THE UNMANNED COMBAT AIR VEHICLE (UCAV) ADVANCED TECHNOLOGY DEMONSTRATOR. THE

V-22 PROGRAM IS CURRENTLY TRANSITIONING TO LOW-RATE INITIAL PRODUCTION.

4

5

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT BUSINESS PERFORMED UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT-

TYPE CONTRACTS CURRENTLY INCLUDE THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, NMD LSI, SPACE

SHUTTLE FLIGHT OPERATIONS AND SPACE SHUTTLE MAIN ENGINE.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE MARKET ENVIRONMENT IS ONE IN WHICH CONTINUED

INTENSE COMPETITION AMONG DEFENSE CONTRACTORS CAN BE EXPECTED, ESPECIALLY IN

LIGHT OF U.S. GOVERNMENT BUDGET CONSTRAINTS. THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO

SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE FOR AND RETAIN SUCH BUSINESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON ITS

TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE, DEMONSTRATED MANAGEMENT PROFICIENCY, STRATEGIC ALLIANCES,

AND COST-EFFECTIVE PERFORMANCE.

THE ACQUISITION AND MERGER CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG U.S. AEROSPACE COMPANIES HAVE

RESULTED IN THREE PRINCIPAL PRIME CONTRACTORS FOR THE DOD AND NASA, INCLUDING

THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT OF THE EXTENSIVE CONSOLIDATION IN THE DEFENSE AND SPACE

INDUSTRY, THE COMPANY AND ITS MAJOR COMPETITORS ARE ALSO PARTNERS OR MAJOR

SUPPLIERS TO EACH OTHER ON VARIOUS PROGRAMS.

THE COMPANY AND LOCKHEED MARTIN ARE 50-50 PARTNERS IN UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE

(USA), WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL GROUND PROCESSING OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE FLEET

AND FOR SPACE-RELATED OPERATIONS WITH THE UNITED STATES AIR FORCE. USA ALSO

PERFORMS THE MODIFICATION, TESTING AND CHECKOUT OPERATIONS REQUIRED TO READY THE

SPACE SHUTTLE FOR LAUNCH. ALTHOUGH THE JOINT VENTURE OPERATIONS ARE NOT INCLUDED

IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY'S PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF

JOINT VENTURE EARNINGS IS RECOGNIZED IN INCOME.

THE SEA LAUNCH PROGRAM IN WHICH BOEING IS A 40% PARTNER WITH RSC ENERGIA (25%)

OF RUSSIA, KVAERNER MARITIME (20%) OF NORWAY, AND KB YUZHNOYE/PO YUZHMACH (15%)

HAD A SUCCESSFUL RETURN TO FLIGHT IN JULY 2000 AFTER AN ICO LAUNCH TERMINATION

EARLIER IN THE YEAR.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AMOUNTED TO $2.0 BILLION, $1.3 BILLION AND

$1.9 BILLION IN 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT EXPENSED IN 2000

INCLUDED $557 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

(IPR&D;). BASED ON CURRENT PROGRAMS AND PLANS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE

FOR 2001 IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF 3.0% TO 3.5% OF THE TOTAL PROJECTED

REVENUES, OF APPROXIMATELY $57 BILLION.

THE COMPANY'S BACKLOG OF FIRM CONTRACTUAL ORDERS (IN BILLIONS) AT DECEMBER 31

FOLLOWS.

NOT INCLUDED IN CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG ARE PURCHASE OPTIONS AND ANNOUNCED ORDERS

FOR WHICH DEFINITIVE CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED AND ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS

THAT HAVE FILED FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION. ADDITIONALLY, U.S. GOVERNMENT AND

FOREIGN MILITARY FIRM BACKLOG IS LIMITED TO AMOUNTS OBLIGATED TO CONTRACTS.

UNOBLIGATED CONTRACT FUNDING NOT INCLUDED IN BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND

1999, TOTALED $31.3 BILLION AND $24.4 BILLION.

IN EVALUATING THE COMPANY'S CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS,

CERTAIN RISK FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. APPROXIMATELY 31% OF THE COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT BACKLOG UNITS ARE SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2003. CHANGES IN THE

ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AIRLINES SOMETIMES RESULT IN

CUSTOMER REQUESTS FOR RESCHEDULING OR CANCELLATION OF CONTRACTUAL ORDERS.

CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT OR

FOR CONVENIENCE BY THE GOVERNMENT IF DEEMED IN ITS BEST INTERESTS. CONTRACTS

THAT ARE TERMINATED FOR CONVENIENCE GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR PAYMENTS TO A

CONTRACTOR FOR ITS COSTS AND A PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF PROFIT FOR WORK

ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE DATE OF TERMINATION. CONTRACTS THAT ARE TERMINATED FOR

DEFAULT GENERALLY PROVIDE THAT THE GOVERNMENT PAYS ONLY FOR THE WORK IT HAS

ACCEPTED, CAN REQUIRE THE CONTRACTOR TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL

CONTRACT PRICE AND THE COST TO REPROCURE THE CONTRACT ITEMS NET OF THE VALUE OF

THE WORK ACCEPTED FROM THE ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR, AND CAN HOLD A CONTRACTOR LIABLE

FOR DAMAGES.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY SOURCES, SUCH AS

ELECTRICITY, AT AFFORDABLE PRICES. THE COMPANY IS ALSO HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE

AVAILABILITY OF ESSENTIAL MATERIALS, PARTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES FROM ITS SUPPLIERS

AND SUBCONTRACTORS. THE MOST IMPORTANT RAW MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR THE COMPANY'S

AEROSPACE PRODUCTS ARE ALUMINUM (SHEET, PLATE, FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS),

TITANIUM (SHEET, PLATE, FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS) AND COMPOSITES (INCLUDING

CARBON AND BORON). ALTHOUGH ALTERNATIVE SOURCES GENERALLY EXIST FOR THESE RAW

MATERIALS, QUALIFICATION OF THE SOURCES COULD TAKE A YEAR OR MORE. MANY MAJOR

COMPONENTS AND PRODUCT EQUIPMENT ITEMS ARE PROCURED OR SUBCONTRACTED ON A SOLE-

SOURCE BASIS WITH A NUMBER OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN COMPANIES. THE COMPANY IS

DEPENDENT UPON THE ABILITY OF ITS LARGE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS

TO MEET PERFORMANCE SPECIFICATIONS, QUALITY STANDARDS, AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES AT

ANTICIPATED COSTS, AND THEIR FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRODUCTION

SCHEDULES AND CONTRACT PROFITABILITY, WHILE JEOPARDIZING THE ABILITY OF THE

COMPANY TO FULFILL COMMITMENTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN

EXTENSIVE QUALIFICATION AND PERFORMANCE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO CONTROL RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES.

WHILE THE COMPANY OWNS NUMEROUS PATENTS AND HAS LICENSES UNDER PATENTS OWNED

BY OTHERS RELATING TO ITS PRODUCTS AND THEIR MANUFACTURE, IT DOES NOT BELIEVE

THAT ITS BUSINESS WOULD BE MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY THE EXPIRATION OF ANY PATENTS

OR TERMINATION OF ANY PATENT LICENSE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS NO TRADEMARKS,

FRANCHISES OR CONCESSIONS THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE TO

THE CONDUCT OF ITS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT AND TO REGULATE THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS

INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS POLICIES, PRACTICES AND

PROCEDURES ARE PROPERLY DESIGNED TO PREVENT UNREASONABLE RISK OF ENVIRONMENTAL

DAMAGE AND THE CONSEQUENT FINANCIAL LIABILITY TO THE COMPANY. COMPLIANCE WITH

ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS REQUIRES CONTINUING MANAGEMENT EFFORT AND

EXPENDITURES BY THE COMPANY. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

HAS NOT HAD IN THE PAST, AND, THE COMPANY BELIEVES, WILL NOT HAVE IN THE FUTURE,

MATERIAL EFFECTS ON THE CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION

OF THE COMPANY. (SEE ITEM 3, LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

REGARDING ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATION.)

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO BUSINESS AND COST CLASSIFICATION REGULATIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH ITS U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE AND SPACE CONTRACTS. VIOLATIONS CAN

RESULT IN CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING FINES,

COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION, FORFEITURES, AND SUSPENSION OR

DEBARMENT FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES (PRINCIPALLY EXPORT SALES FROM DOMESTIC

OPERATIONS) BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA ARE INCLUDED ON PAGE 73 OF THE COMPANY'S 2000

ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. LESS THAN 1%

OF TOTAL SALES WERE DERIVED FROM NON-U.S. OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY FOR EACH OF

THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000. APPROXIMATELY 43% OF THE

COMPANY'S CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG VALUE AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, WAS WITH NON-U.S.

CUSTOMERS. SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE INFLUENCED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT

FOREIGN POLICY, INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TRADE POLICIES OF GOVERNMENTS

WORLDWIDE. RELATIVE PROFITABILITY IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT

EXPERIENCED IN THE DOMESTIC MARKET.

APPROXIMATELY 28% OF COMBINED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL

FINANCING CONSISTED OF AMOUNTS DUE FROM CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE AMOUNTS ARE PAYABLE IN U.S. DOLLARS, AND, IN

MANAGEMENT'S OPINION, RELATED RISKS ARE ADEQUATELY COVERED BY ALLOWANCE FOR

LOSSES. THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED MATERIALLY ADVERSE FINANCIAL

CONSEQUENCES AS A RESULT OF SALES AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES.

THE COMPANY'S WORKFORCE LEVEL AT JANUARY 25, 2001, WAS APPROXIMATELY 198,000,

INCLUDING APPROXIMATELY 3,200 IN CANADA AND 1,500 IN AUSTRALIA.

PROPERTIES OWNED BY OTHERS AND ARE USED BY THE COMPANY JOINTLY WITH OTHERS. THE

COMPANY'S RIGHTS TO USE SUCH FACILITIES ARE PROVIDED FOR UNDER LONG-TERM LEASES

WITH MUNICIPAL, COUNTY, PORT, OR OTHER GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES.  IN ADDITION, THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT FURNISHES THE COMPANY CERTAIN OFFICE SPACE, INSTALLATIONS AND

EQUIPMENT AT GOVERNMENT BASES FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS CONTRACT

ACTIVITIES. FACILITIES AT THE MAJOR LOCATIONS SUPPORT ALL PRINCIPAL INDUSTRY

SEGMENTS. WORK RELATED TO A GIVEN PROGRAM MAY BE ASSIGNED TO VARIOUS LOCATIONS

BASED UPON PERIODIC REVIEW OF SHOP LOADS AND PRODUCTIONS CAPABILITY.

CONDITION. PRESENTLY EXISTING FACILITIES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE COMPANY'S

NEAR-TERM OPERATING REQUIREMENTS.

ITEM 3.	LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS,

CONTRACTS AND OTHER MATTERS ARE PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY. MOST SIGNIFICANT

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO MATTERS COVERED BY INSURANCE. MAJOR

CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF THE

ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THOSE FOR DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND

REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES. DUE IN PART TO THEIR COMPLEXITY AND

PERVASIVENESS, SUCH REQUIREMENTS HAVE RESULTED IN THE COMPANY BEING INVOLVED

WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND-REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS SINCE THE

1980S.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES, BASED ON IN-DEPTH STUDIES, EXPERT ANALYSES AND

LEGAL REVIEWS, ITS CONTINGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS FOR REMEDIATION OF

CONTAMINATED SITES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RANGES AND PROBABILITIES OF

RECOVERIES FROM OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO HAVE AND HAVE NOT AGREED TO A

SETTLEMENT AND OF RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS. THE COMPANY'S POLICY IS TO

IMMEDIATELY ACCRUE AND CHARGE TO CURRENT EXPENSE IDENTIFIED EXPOSURES RELATED TO

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SITES BASED ON CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES OF

INVESTIGATION, CLEANUP AND MONITORING COSTS TO BE INCURRED.

THE COSTS INCURRED AND EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH

ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT HAD, AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE

COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION. WITH RESPECT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, RELATED

CHARGES HAVE AVERAGED LESS THAN 2% OF ANNUAL NET EARNINGS. SUCH ACCRUALS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2000, WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR THE RELATED CONTINGENT RECOVERIES

FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS, ARE LESS THAN 2% OF TOTAL LIABILITIES.

BECAUSE OF THE REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES AND RISK OF UNIDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED

SITES AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

COSTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTIMATED COSTS ACCRUED FOR IDENTIFIED

CONTAMINATED SITES. HOWEVER, BASED ON ALL KNOWN FACTS AND EXPERT ANALYSES, THE

COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS NOT REASONABLY LIKELY THAT IDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL

CONTINGENCIES WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

IMPACT TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOW

TRENDS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OF ITS PRACTICES FROM

WHICH CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT. SUCH

PROCEEDINGS COULD INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES,

COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION AND/OR FORFEITURES. UNDER

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, A COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS OPERATING DIVISIONS OR

SUBDIVISIONS, CAN ALSO BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, OR

LOSE ITS EXPORT PRIVILEGES, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES, BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH

GOVERNMENT DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION OR CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

IN 1991, THE U.S. NAVY NOTIFIED THE COMPANY AND GENERAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION

(THE TEAM) THAT IT WAS TERMINATING FOR DEFAULT THE TEAM'S CONTRACT FOR

DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE A-12 AIRCRAFT. THE TEAM FILED A LEGAL

ACTION TO CONTEST THE NAVY'S DEFAULT TERMINATION, TO ASSERT ITS RIGHTS TO

CONVERT THE TERMINATION TO ONE FOR "THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT," AND TO

OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COSTS INCURRED ON THE A-12 CONTRACT BUT NOT

PAID TO DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, INVENTORIES INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $581

MILLION OF RECORDED COSTS ON THE A-12 CONTRACT, AGAINST WHICH THE COMPANY HAS

ESTABLISHED A LOSS PROVISION OF $350 MILLION. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVISION, WHICH

WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1990, WAS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S BELIEF, SUPPORTED BY AN

OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WOULD BE CONVERTED

TO A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, THAT THE TEAM WOULD ESTABLISH A CLAIM FOR

CONTRACT ADJUSTMENTS FOR A MINIMUM OF $250 MILLION, THAT THERE WAS A RANGE OF

REASONABLY POSSIBLE RESULTS ON TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, AND THAT IT WAS

PRUDENT TO PROVIDE FOR WHAT THE COMPANY THEN BELIEVED WAS THE UPPER RANGE OF

POSSIBLE LOSS ON TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, WHICH WAS $350 MILLION.

ON JULY 1, 1999, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

REVERSED A MARCH 31, 1998, JUDGMENT OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS

FOR THE TEAM. THE 1998 JUDGMENT WAS BASED ON A DETERMINATION THAT THE GOVERNMENT

HAD NOT EXERCISED THE REQUIRED DISCRETION BEFORE ISSUING A TERMINATION FOR

DEFAULT. IT CONVERTED THE TERMINATION TO A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, AND

DETERMINED THE TEAM WAS ENTITLED TO BE PAID $1,200 MILLION, PLUS STATUTORY

INTEREST FROM JUNE 26, 1991, UNTIL PAID. THE COURT OF APPEALS REMANDED THE CASE

TO THE COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS FOR A DETERMINATION AS TO WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT

IS ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE BURDEN OF SHOWING A DEFAULT WAS JUSTIFIED AND OTHER

PROCEEDINGS. TRIAL ON ALL ISSUES NOW IS SET FOR MAY 1, 2001. FINAL RESOLUTION OF

THE A-12 LITIGATION WILL DEPEND ON THE OUTCOME OF SUCH TRIAL AND POSSIBLE

FURTHER APPEALS OR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

IN THE COMPANY'S OPINION, THE LOSS PROVISION CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY

FOR THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE REDUCTION IN VALUE OF A-12 NET CONTRACTS IN PROCESS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, AS A RESULT OF A TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT FOR THE

CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN PROVIDED WITH AN OPINION OF

OUTSIDE COUNSEL THAT (I) THE GOVERNMENT'S TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT FOR

DEFAULT WAS CONTRARY TO LAW AND FACT, (II) THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE

COMPANY ARE THE SAME AS IF THE TERMINATION HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR THE CONVENIENCE

OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND (III) SUBJECT TO PREVAILING ON THE ISSUE THAT THE

TERMINATION IS PROPERLY ONE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE PROBABLE

RECOVERY BY THE COMPANY IS NOT LESS THAN $250 MILLION.

ON OCTOBER 31, 1997, A FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWSUIT WAS FILED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, IN

SEATTLE. THE LAWSUIT NAMES AS DEFENDANTS THE COMPANY AND THREE OF ITS THEN

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS OF A SIMILAR NATURE HAVE BEEN FILED IN

THE SAME COURT. THESE LAWSUITS WERE CONSOLIDATED ON FEBRUARY 24, 1998. THE

LAWSUITS GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS DESIRED TO KEEP THE COMPANY'S

SHARE PRICE AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE MCDONNELL DOUGLAS

SHAREHOLDERS WOULD APPROVE THE MERGER AND, IN THE CASE OF THE INDIVIDUAL

DEFENDANTS, TO BENEFIT DIRECTLY FROM THE SALE OF BOEING STOCK DURING THE PERIOD

FROM APRIL 7, 1997 THROUGH OCTOBER 22, 1997. BY ORDER DATED MAY 1, 2000, THE

COURT CERTIFIED TWO SUBCLASSES OF PLAINTIFFS IN THE ACTION: A. ALL PERSONS OR

ENTITIES WHO PURCHASED BOEING STOCK OR CALL OPTIONS OR WHO SOLD PUT OPTIONS

DURING THE PERIOD FROM JULY 21, 1997, THROUGH OCTOBER 22, 1997, AND B. ALL

PERSONS OR ENTITIES WHO PURCHASED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS STOCK ON OR AFTER APRIL 7,

1997, AND WHO HELD SUCH STOCK UNTIL IT CONVERTED TO BOEING STOCK PURSUANT TO THE

10

11

MERGER. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND TREBLE DAMAGES. THE ACTION

NOW IS SET FOR TRIAL ON MARCH 7, 2002. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE ALLEGATIONS

ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND THAT THE OUTCOME OF THESE LAWSUITS WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS EARNINGS, CASH FLOW OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

ON OCTOBER 19, 1999, AN INDICTMENT WAS RETURNED BY A FEDERAL GRAND JURY

SITTING IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CHARGING THAT MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION

(MDC), A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, AND MDC'S DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT

COMPANY DIVISION, CONSPIRED TO AND MADE FALSE STATEMENTS AND CONCEALED MATERIAL

FACTS ON EXPORT LICENSE APPLICATIONS AND IN CONNECTION WITH EXPORT LICENSES, AND

POSSESSED AND SOLD MACHINE TOOLS IN VIOLATION OF THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION ACT.

THE INDICTMENT ALSO CHARGED ONE EMPLOYEE WITH PARTICIPATION IN THE ALLEGED

CONSPIRACY. (THE INDICTMENT HAS SINCE BEEN DISMISSED AS AGAINST THAT EMPLOYEE

BUT HIS DISMISSAL IS THE SUBJECT OF A PENDING APPEAL BY THE GOVERNMENT TO THE

U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT.) THE INDICTMENT RELATES TO THE SALE

AND EXPORT TO CHINA IN 1993-1995 OF SURPLUS, USED MACHINE TOOLS SOLD BY DOUGLAS

AIRCRAFT COMPANY TO CHINA NATIONAL AERO-TECHNOLOGY IMPORT AND EXPORT CORPORATION

FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH THE MD-80/90 COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT TRUNKLINER PROGRAM

IN CHINA.

AS A RESULT OF THE INDICTMENT, THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HAS DISCRETION TO DENY

DEFENSE-RELATED EXPORT PRIVILEGES TO MDC OR A DIVISION OR SUBSIDIARY OF MDC. THE

AGENCY EXERCISED THAT DISCRETION ON JANUARY 5, 2000, BY ESTABLISHING A "DENIAL

POLICY" WITH RESPECT TO DEFENSE-RELATED EXPORTS OF MDC AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES.

MOST OF MDC'S MAJOR EXISTING DEFENSE PROGRAMS WERE, HOWEVER, EXCEPTED FROM THAT

POLICY DUE TO OVERRIDING U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY INTERESTS.

OTHER EXCEPTIONS HAVE BEEN GRANTED. THERE CAN, HOWEVER, BE NO ASSURANCE AS TO

HOW THE DEPARTMENT WILL EXERCISE ITS DISCRETION AS TO PROGRAM OR TRANSACTION

EXCEPTIONS FOR OTHER PROGRAMS OR FUTURE DEFENSE-RELATED EXPORTS. IN ADDITION,

THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE HAS AUTHORITY TO TEMPORARILY DENY OTHER EXPORT

PRIVILEGES TO, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAS AUTHORITY TO SUSPEND OR DEBAR

FROM CONTRACTING WITH THE MILITARY DEPARTMENTS, MDC OR A DIVISION OR SUBSIDIARY

OF MDC. NEITHER AGENCY HAS TAKEN ACTION ADVERSE TO MDC OR ITS DIVISIONS OR

SUBSIDIARIES THUS FAR. BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THE COMPANY DOES

NOT EXPECT ACTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL

POSITION OR CONTINUING OPERATIONS. IN THE UNANTICIPATED EVENT OF A CONVICTION,

MDC WOULD BE SUBJECT TO DEPARTMENT OF STATE AND DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DENIALS

OR REVOCATIONS OF MDC EXPORT LICENSES. MDC ALSO WOULD BE SUBJECT TO DEPARTMENT

OF DEFENSE DEBARMENT PROCEEDINGS.

ON FEBRUARY 25, 2000, A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ALLEGING GENDER

DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT WAS FILED AGAINST THE BOEING COMPANY, BOEING NORTH

AMERICAN, INC., AND MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION. THE COMPLAINT, FILED WITH THE

UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE, ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY HAS ENGAGED IN

A PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT AND RETALIATION

AGAINST FEMALES OVER THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS. THE COMPLAINT, BECK V. BOEING,

NAMES 28 WOMEN WHO HAVE WORKED FOR BOEING IN THE PUGET SOUND AREA; WICHITA,

KANSAS; ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI; AND TULSA, OKLAHOMA. ON MARCH 15, AN AMENDED

COMPLAINT WAS FILED NAMING AN ADDITIONAL 10 PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING THE FIRST FROM

CALIFORNIA. THE LAWSUIT ATTEMPTS TO REPRESENT ALL WOMEN WHO CURRENTLY WORK FOR

THE COMPANY, OR WHO HAVE WORKED FOR THE COMPANY IN THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS

(APPROXIMATELY 70,000).

11

12

THE COMPANY HAS DENIED THE ALLEGATION THAT IT HAS ENGAGED IN ANY UNLAWFUL

"PATTERN AND PRACTICE" AND BELIEVES THAT THE PLAINTIFFS CANNOT SATISFY THE

RIGOROUS REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE CLASS ACTION STATUS THEY SEEK.

THE DEADLINE FOR FILING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION, ORIGINALLY

SCHEDULED TO BE HEARD ON AUGUST 25, 2000, NOW HAS BEEN EXTENDED UNTIL MAY 2001.

THE COMPANY INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY CONTEST THIS LAWSUIT.

IN OCTOBER 1999, A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS FILED A FEDERAL COURT

ACTION ALLEGING EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION BASED UPON RACE AND NATIONAL (SIC)

ORIGIN (ASIAN). THIS ACTION WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CONSOLIDATED WITH A RELATED SUIT

MAKING SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS AND CLASS ACTION STATUS WAS SOUGHT IN A MOTION FILED

ON JANUARY 3, 2001. THE CLASS FOR WHICH CERTIFICATION IS BEING SOUGHT WOULD

INCLUDE ALL NON-MANAGEMENT SALARIED WORKERS OF ASIAN DESCENT EMPLOYED IN

WASHINGTON STATE. THE ACTION IS LIMITED TO CLAIMS OF ALLEGED DISCRIMINATION IN

COMPENSATION, PROMOTION, TRANSFER, RETENTION RATING, AND JOB CLASSIFICATION.

THE COMPANY HAS DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS OF DISCRIMINATION AND PLANS TO OPPOSE

THE MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION AND VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THE LAWSUIT. THE

COURT'S DECISION ON CLASS CERTIFICATION IS ANTICIPATED TO BE ISSUED AS EARLY AS

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2001.

WITH $6.8 BILLION IN 1999 AND $6.9 BILLION IN 1998. THE SEGMENT IS BROADLY

DIVERSIFIED. THE PRINCIPAL CONTRIBUTORS TO 2000 SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

SEGMENT REVENUES INCLUDED NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE LEAD SYSTEM INTEGRATOR (NMD

LSI) AND THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, EACH ACCOUNTING FOR APPROXIMATELY 15%

OF 2000 REVENUES. OTHER PRINCIPAL CONTRIBUTORS INCLUDED SATELLITE SYSTEM

PROGRAMS, PRINCIPALLY FROM THE HUGHES SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES

ACQUIRED FROM HUGHES AND RENAMED BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS (BSS), SPACE SHUTTLE

FLIGHT OPERATIONS AND MAIN ENGINE, E-3 AWACS (AIRBORNE WARNING AND CONTROL

SYSTEM) UPDATES, DELTA SPACE LAUNCH SERVICES, AND CLASSIFIED PROJECTS FOR THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT.

CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING/OTHER

OPERATING REVENUES IN THE CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING/OTHER SEGMENT WERE

$758 MILLION IN 2000, COMPARED WITH $771 MILLION IN 1999 AND $612 MILLION IN

1998. THE MAJOR REVENUE COMPONENTS INCLUDE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT FINANCING AND

COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT LEASING.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ABOUT REVENUES AND EARNINGS CONTRIBUTIONS BY BUSINESS

BASED ON CURRENT SCHEDULES AND PLANS, THE COMPANY PROJECTS TOTAL 2001 REVENUES

TO BE APPROXIMATELY $57 BILLION.

EARNINGS

NET EARNINGS.

[GRAPHIC AND IMAGE MATERIAL ITEM NUMBER 3

SEE APPENDIX ON PAGE 112 FOR DESCRIPTION]

NET EARNINGS OF $2,128 MILLION FOR 2000 WERE $181 MILLION LOWER THAN 1999

EARNINGS. NET EARNINGS IN 2000 WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY $557 MILLION

EXPENSED AS IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ($348 MILLION AFTER TAX)

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITIONS IN 2000, PRINCIPALLY TO THE

ACQUISITION OF THE HUGHES SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES, WHICH BECAME

BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS. NET EARNINGS ALSO REFLECTED SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENT

IN COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES MARGINS RESULTING FROM CONTINUED PRODUCTION

EFFICIENCIES.

IN 2000, OTHER INCOME INCLUDED $73 MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE

TO FEDERAL INCOME TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENTS, AND A $42 MILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF

A LONG-HELD EQUITY INVESTMENT. SHARE-BASED PLAN EXPENSE IN 2000 INCLUDED $58

MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS EXTENDED TO EMPLOYEES OF

BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS WHO HAD BEEN COVERED UNDER VARIOUS COMPENSATION

ARRANGEMENTS PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION. ALSO, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED IN THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000 AN ACTUARIAL EXPENSE OF $38 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO A

PENSION CURTAILMENT ASSOCIATED WITH EMPLOYEES OF THE ST. LOUIS FABRICATION

OPERATIONS THAT WERE SOLD IN JANUARY 2001.

NET EARNINGS OF $2,309 MILLION FOR 1999 WERE $1,189 MILLION HIGHER THAN 1998

EARNINGS PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS THAT ARE DISCUSSED IN

THE FOLLOWING PARAGRAPHS. INCREASED OPERATING EARNINGS RESULTED PRINCIPALLY

29

30

FROM HIGHER COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT MARGINS THAT REFLECT IMPROVED

PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES, AS WELL AS EARNINGS FROM INCREASED COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANES REVENUE ($38.5 BILLION IN 1999 VERSUS $37.0 BILLION IN 1998). A $350

MILLION PRETAX FORWARD LOSS ($218 MILLION AFTER TAX) RECOGNIZED ON THE NEXT-

GENERATION 737 PROGRAM ALSO ADVERSELY IMPACTED OPERATING EARNINGS FOR 1998.

ADDITIONALLY, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COMPANYWIDE DECREASED BY $554 MILLION TO

$1,341 MILLION IN 1999. NET GAIN ON DISPOSITIONS FOR 1999 OF $87 MILLION

COMPARES WITH $13 MILLION IN 1998 AND PRINCIPALLY REFLECT THE $95 MILLION GAIN

ON THE SALE OF BOEING INFORMATION SYSTEMS. OFFSETTING THESE INCREASES IN 1999

NET EARNINGS RELATIVE TO 1998 WERE CHARGES IN 1999 OF $270 MILLION ($169

MILLION AFTER TAX) ASSOCIATED WITH THE F-15 PROGRAM.

OTHER INCOME WAS $585 MILLION IN 1999 AND $283 MILLION IN 1998. THE 1999

INCREASE WAS PRINCIPALLY DUE TO $289 MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME RECORDED FROM

THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS), AND $66 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RECEIPT

AND SUBSEQUENT SALE OF SHARES RESULTING FROM AN INITIAL PUBLIC OFFERING OF AN

INSURER. INTEREST INCOME FROM THE IRS RESULTED FROM A PARTIAL AGREEMENT ON THE

EXAMINATION OF THE YEARS 1988 THROUGH 1991.

THE NET AMOUNT RECOGNIZED IN THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL POSITION RELATIVE TO

PENSIONS INCLUDES APPROXIMATELY $10.7 BILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED NET ACTUARIAL

GAINS. THE COMPANY PROJECTS THAT IN THE NEAR TERM, NET PERIODIC PENSION BENEFIT

INCOME WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED, AND THAT THE 2001 NET PERIODIC PENSION

BENEFIT INCOME WILL BE MORE THAN $400 MILLION GREATER THAN THE $428 MILLION

RECOGNIZED IN 2000. ADDITIONALLY, NET PERIODIC BENEFIT COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS ARE ALSO PROJECTED TO INCREASE SUBSTANTIALLY IN

THE NEAR TERM. NOT ALL NET PERIODIC BENEFIT INCOME OR EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN

NET EARNINGS IN THE YEAR INCURRED SINCE THESE COSTS ARE PRINCIPALLY ALLOCATED

TO PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT COSTS, AND A PORTION REMAINS IN INVENTORY AT THE END

OF A REPORTED PERIOD.

THE COMPANY HAS RECENTLY EXPERIENCED RISING EMPLOYEE HEALTH CARE COSTS, AND

THESE COSTS ARE PROJECTED TO INCREASE IN THE NEAR TERM, SIMILAR TO HEALTH CARE

COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RETIREES.

OPERATING RESULTS TRENDS ARE NOT SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY THE EFFECT OF

CHANGING PRICES SINCE MOST OF THE COMPANY'S BUSINESS IS PERFORMED UNDER

CONTRACT.

OPERATING EARNINGS

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

THE 2000 COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT EARNINGS OF $2,736 MILLION (BASED ON THE

COST OF SPECIFIC AIRPLANE UNITS DELIVERED - SEE DISCUSSION UNDER SEGMENT

INFORMATION ON PAGE 53) RESULTED IN AN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS MARGIN OF 8.8%,

OR 10.8% EXCLUSIVE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AND IN-PROCESS RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. THE 1999 COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT EARNINGS OF

$2,082 MILLION RESULTED IN AN EARNINGS FROM OPERATIONS MARGIN OF 5.4%, OR 6.9%

EXCLUSIVE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. THE INCREASED EARNINGS AND

MARGINS FOR 2000 WERE PRINCIPALLY DUE TO CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE

PRODUCTION PROCESS.

CUSTOMER ADVANCE PAYMENTS PRIOR TO DELIVERY MAY BE DELAYED OR CONTRACTUALLY

DEFERRED FROM A BASELINE SCHEDULE, RESULTING IN THE RECOGNITION OF INTEREST

INCOME. BEGINNING IN 2000, REVENUES RESULTING FROM DEFERRED CUSTOMER ADVANCES

WERE IDENTIFIED TO THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT, AND HAD PREVIOUSLY BEEN

IDENTIFIED TO THE CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING/OTHER SEGMENT. THESE

30

31

REVENUES TOTALED $83 MILLION IN 2000, AND $66 MILLION AND $118 MILLION WERE

RECLASSIFIED TO THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT FOR 1999 AND 1998.

THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT LOSS OF $148 MILLION IN 1998 COMPARES WITH

EARNINGS OF $2,082 MILLION IN 1999. THE INCREASED EARNINGS AND MARGINS FOR 1999

WERE PRINCIPALLY DUE TO SUBSTANTIALLY IMPROVED PRODUCTION PERFORMANCE ACROSS

THE SEGMENT. MARGINS ON THE NEXT-GENERATION 737 AND 777 PROGRAMS REFLECTED

SIGNIFICANT LEARNING CURVE IMPROVEMENT AND UNIT COST PERFORMANCE. ADDITIONALLY,

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DECREASED BY $436 MILLION

TO $585 MILLION IN 1999.

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT EARNINGS, AS DETERMINED UNDER GENERALLY

ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES (GAAP), REFLECT THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING

AND INCORPORATE A PORTION OF THE 'ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS' CAPTION

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 1. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT EARNINGS UNDER GAAP, AND

INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, WERE $2,099 MILLION FOR 2000, $1,778

MILLION FOR 1999 AND $366 FOR 1998, AND COMPARABLE MARGINS WERE 6.7%, 4.6% AND

1.0% (OR 8.7%, 6.1% AND 3.7% EXCLUDING R&D;) FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE IMPROVING GAAP MARGINS OVER THIS PERIOD REFLECT IMPROVED UNIT COSTS OVER

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, ALONG WITH THE IMPACT OF ADDITIONAL UNITS WITHIN THE

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR THE NEXT-GENERATION 737 AND THE 777.  BECAUSE OF THE

HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW PROGRAM AND

THE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT REQUIRED FOR INITIAL TOOLING AND SPECIAL EQUIPMENT,

NEW COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS NORMALLY HAVE LOWER OPERATING PROFIT

MARGINS THAN ESTABLISHED PROGRAMS. THE INCREASE OF THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR

A NEW PROGRAM GENERALLY RESULTS IN IMPROVED MARGINS.  THE NEXT-GENERATION 737

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY WAS 400 UNITS AT THE BEGINNING OF 1998 (A PRETAX

FORWARD LOSS OF $350 MILLION WAS RECOGNIZED IN FIRST QUARTER 1998), 800 UNITS

AT THE END OF 1998, 1,200 UNITS AT THE END OF 1999 AND 1,650 UNITS AT THE END

OF 2000. THE 777 ACCOUNTING QUANTITY WAS 500 AT THE END OF 1998 AND 1999 AND

600 AT THE END OF 2000. IMPROVED MARGINS FROM 1999 TO 2000 ALSO REFLECT AN

INCREASE IN ESTIMATED REVENUE FOR AIRPLANES WITHIN THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

QUANTITIES.

IN 1999, THE COMPANY DELIVERED THE INITIAL UNITS OF THE 717 PROGRAM, AND 44

UNITS HAVE CUMULATIVELY BEEN DELIVERED AS OF YEAR-END 2000.  THE 717 PROGRAM IS

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.  THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED THE PROGRAM

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY AT 200 UNITS. THE COMPANY WILL RECORD 717 DELIVERIES ON A

BREAK-EVEN BASIS UNTIL PROGRAM REVIEWS INDICATE POSITIVE GROSS PROFIT WITHIN

THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. SUCH PROGRAM REVIEWS COULD INCLUDE REVISED

ASSUMPTIONS OF REVENUES AND COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS SIGNIFICANT EXPOSURES

RELATED TO THE 717 PROGRAM, PRINCIPALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO PRICING PRESSURES AND

THE SLOW BUILDUP OF FIRM ORDERS. CURRENT FIRM CONTRACTS FOR THE 717 PROGRAM

INCLUDE A CONTRACT FOR 50 AIRPLANES WITH TRANS WORLD AIRLINES (TWA), OF WHICH

15 HAVE BEEN DELIVERED. ON JANUARY 10, 2001, TWA AND CERTAIN OF ITS DOMESTIC

SUBSIDIARIES FILED VOLUNTARY PETITIONS FOR RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE

UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY CODE IN THE UNITED STATES BANKRUPTCY COURT FOR THE

DISTRICT OF DELAWARE. TWA ALSO FILED A MOTION SEEKING THE COURT'S APPROVAL OF

AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC., A SUBSIDIARY OF AMR

CORPORATION, PURSUANT TO SECTION 363 OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. TWA HAS RECEIVED

$200 MILLION IN DEBTOR IN POSSESSION FINANCING FROM AMERICAN. THIS FINANCING IS

INTENDED TO ENABLE TWA'S CONTINUED OPERATION DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD. THE

SALE OF TWA'S ASSETS TO AMERICAN AIRLINES, INC., IS SUBJECT TO BETTER OFFERS AS

A RESULT OF A BIDDING PROCESS, PLUS BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVAL. IT IS UNCLEAR IF

31

32

TWA OR ANY SUCCESSOR COMPANY WILL COMMIT TO THE DELIVERY OF THE REMAINING 717

AIRCRAFT. THE COMPANY CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT THESE UNITS CAN BE PLACED WITH

OTHER POTENTIAL CUSTOMERS, IF NECESSARY.  SEE ALSO THE DISCUSSION IN THE

CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING/OTHER SECTION REGARDING ADDITIONAL EXPOSURE

RELATING TO TWA.

THE COMPANY PROJECTS SIGNIFICANT MARKET OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE COMMERCIAL

AVIATION SUPPORT MARKET OVER THE NEXT TWO DECADES. FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE

NEED FOR AVIATION SUPPORT INCLUDE DEREGULATION, PRIVATIZATION AND

GLOBALIZATION, WHICH HAVE INCREASED COMPETITION AND FORCED AIRLINES TO OPERATE

MORE EFFICIENTLY. THE COMPANY WILL FOCUS ON TOTAL LIFE-CYCLE OPPORTUNITIES,

WHICH INCLUDE AIRPLANE SERVICING AND MAINTENANCE, AND AIRPORT AND ROUTE

INFRASTRUCTURE SERVICES.

THE COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT MARKET AND THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REMAIN

EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. COMPETITIVE PRESSURES AND INCREASED LOWER-FARE PERSONAL

TRAVEL HAVE COMBINED TO CAUSE A LONG-TERM DOWNWARD TREND IN PASSENGER REVENUE

YIELDS WORLDWIDE (MEASURED IN REAL TERMS). MARKET LIBERALIZATION WITHIN EUROPE

HAS ENABLED LOW-COST AIRLINES TO ENTER THE MARKET. THESE AIRLINES INCREASE THE

DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON AIRFARES, SIMILAR TO THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE

UNITED STATES. AIRFARES BETWEEN ASIA AND THE UNITED STATES ARE AMONG THE LOWEST

YIELD (AIRFARE DIVIDED BY REVENUE PASSENGER MILES) OF ANY IN THE WORLD. THESE

FACTORS RESULT IN CONTINUED PRICE PRESSURE ON THE COMPANY'S PRODUCTS. MAJOR

PRODUCTIVITY GAINS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE A FAVORABLE MARKET POSITION AT

ACCEPTABLE PROFIT MARGINS.

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS FOR 2000 AND 1999

WERE $1,271 MILLION AND $1,193 MILLION. THE SEGMENT OPERATING MARGINS WERE

10.4% AND 9.8% FOR 2000 AND 1999. THE 2000 OPERATING RESULTS REFLECT STRONG

PROFITS ON MAJOR PRODUCTION PROGRAMS. THESE PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE C-17

GLOBEMASTER, F/A-18E/F SUPER HORNET, F/A-18C/D HORNET, T-45 GOSHAWK TRAINING

SYSTEM, AV-8B HARRIER, AND THE HARPOON MISSILE. THE 1999 OPERATING RESULTS

INCLUDED A FAVORABLE CONTRACT SETTLEMENT AMOUNTING TO $55 MILLION AND PRETAX

CHARGES OF $270 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE F-15 PROGRAM. A SIGNIFICANT

PERCENTAGE OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES SEGMENT BUSINESS HAS BEEN IN

DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT-TYPE CONTRACTS, WHICH GENERALLY

HAVE LOWER PROFIT MARGINS THAN FIXED-PRICE-TYPE CONTRACTS. CURRENT MAJOR

DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE F-22 RAPTOR, JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER, V-22

OSPREY TILTROTOR AIRCRAFT, AND THE RAH-66 COMANCHE HELICOPTER.  THE F-22 RAPTOR

AND V-22 PROGRAMS ARE CURRENTLY TRANSITIONING TO LOW-RATE INITIAL PRODUCTION.

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS FOR 2000 AND 1999,

WERE $260 MILLION AND $320 MILLION, PRIOR TO NON-RECURRING ITEMS.

OPERATING MARGINS WERE 3.2% AND 4.7% FOR 2000 AND 1999.  THE 2000 OPERATING

RESULTS INCLUDED A NON-RECURRING PRETAX CHARGE OF $500 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH

THE IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FROM THE ACQUISITIONS OF HUGHES SPACE

AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES, ALONG WITH $78 MILLION IN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH

A DELTA III DEMONSTRATION LAUNCH IN AUGUST 2000.  OPERATING RESULTS FOR 1999

INCLUDED A PRETAX GAIN OF $95 MILLION RELATED TO THE SALE OF BOEING INFORMATION

SYSTEMS TO SCIENCE APPLICATIONS INTERNATIONAL CORPORATION IN JULY 1999.

THE SEGMENT OPERATING MARGINS WERE REDUCED BY SIGNIFICANT COMPANY

INVESTMENTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS, IN PARTICULAR, THE DELTA IV

LAUNCH VEHICLE AND THE AIRCRAFT INTERNET DATA SERVICE KNOWN AS CONNEXION BY

BOEINGSM.  EARNINGS WERE ALSO IMPACTED BY THE AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL AND

32

33

ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES OF $28 MILLION, PRINCIPALLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE

ACQUISITION OF BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS.  2001 OPERATING EARNINGS WILL CONTINUE

TO BE IMPACTED BY NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES BUT TO A LESSER DEGREE THAN

PRIOR YEARS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TRANSITION OF DEVELOPMENT PRODUCTS INTO

PRODUCTION.  CONNEXION BY BOEINGSM PRODUCT LINE WAS REALIGNED AND WILL BEGIN

PERFORMANCE REPORTING SEPARATELY IN 2001.  OPERATING RESULTS FOR 1999 INCLUDED

FAVORABLE CONTRACT SETTLEMENTS.  PROGRAM MARGINS FOR THE SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT, EXCLUDING NON-RECURRING ITEMS, CONTRACT SETTLEMENT IN

1999 AND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WERE 10.8% IN 2000 AND 11.2% IN 1999.

MARGINS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN 2001 AS DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS MOVE CLOSER TO

ENTERING THE OPERATIONAL PHASE.

SOFTENING OF THE COMMERCIAL LAUNCH MARKET CONTINUED IN 2000.  AS PREVIOUSLY

MENTIONED, A DELTA III DEMONSTRATION LAUNCH WAS COMPLETED AT COMPANY EXPENSE IN

AUGUST, MARKING A SUCCESSFUL RETURN TO FLIGHT AND PROVING SYSTEM RELIABILITY.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO HAVE RISK RELATED TO WORK IN PROCESS INVENTORY AND

SUPPLIER COMMITMENTS FOR THE DELTA III PROGRAM, AND THESE RISK ASSESSMENTS

REMAIN CLOSELY MONITORED. THE NEXT DELTA III LAUNCH IS ANTICIPATED FOR 2002.

THE SEA LAUNCH PROGRAM IN WHICH BOEING IS A 40% PARTNER WITH RSC ENERGIA

(25%) OF RUSSIA, KVAERNER MARITIME (20%) OF NORWAY, AND KB YUZHNOYE/PO YUZHMACH

(15%) OF UKRAINE ALSO HAD A SUCCESSFUL RETURN TO FLIGHT IN JULY 2000.  THE

VENTURE INCURRED LOSSES IN 2000 DUE TO THE TERMINATION OF AN ICO LAUNCH EARLY

IN THE YEAR AND EXPENSES RELATED TO INITIAL OPERATIONS.  SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS INCLUDE LOSSES OF $26 MILLION AND $57

MILLION FOR 2000 AND 1999 ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE. THE COMPANY

HAS ONGOING OPERATIONAL AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE DUE TO THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE,

AND THE FINANCIAL EXPOSURE PRINCIPALLY RESULTS FROM COMPANY GUARANTEES EXTENDED

ON PARTNERSHIP LOANS. THE COMPANY'S MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES

ASSOCIATED WITH CREDIT GUARANTEES, DISCLOSED IN NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, INCLUDES $373 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO SEA LAUNCH.  THE

COMPANY PROJECTS THAT THE SEA LAUNCH JOINT VENTURE WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL

INFUSIONS FROM THE PARTNERS DURING 2001.  THIS IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN

ADDITIONAL CASH REQUIREMENTS AND/OR LOAN GUARANTEES IMPOSED ON THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY AND LOCKHEED MARTIN ARE 50-50 PARTNERS IN UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE,

WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL GROUND PROCESSING OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE FLEET AND

FOR SPACE-RELATED OPERATIONS WITH THE U.S. AIR FORCE.  UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE

ALSO PERFORMS MODIFICATIONS, TESTING AND CHECKOUT OPERATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED

TO READY THE SPACE SHUTTLE FOR LAUNCH.  THE JOINT VENTURE OPERATIONS ARE NOT

INCLUDED IN THE COMPANY'S CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS; HOWEVER, THE COMPANY'S

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF JOINT VENTURE EARNINGS IS RECOGNIZED AS INCOME.  THE

SEGMENT'S OPERATING EARNINGS INCLUDE EARNINGS OF $60 MILLION AND $48 MILLION

FOR 2000 AND 1999 ATTRIBUTABLE TO UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE.

CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING/OTHER

OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THE CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING/OTHER SEGMENT WERE

$494 MILLION IN 2000, $426 MILLION IN 1999, AND $249 MILLION IN 1998, EXCLUSIVE

OF INTEREST EXPENSE. THE INCREASE IN EARNINGS DURING THE PERIOD OCCURRED

PRINCIPALLY BECAUSE OF SIGNIFICANT PROVISIONS FOR LOSSES AND WRITE-DOWNS OF

EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASE IN 1998 AND 1999. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING

EARNINGS FROM 1998 TO 1999 ALSO REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN SEGMENT REVENUE OF $159

MILLION.

INCLUDED IN THIS SEGMENT'S ASSETS IS $1,459 MILLION OF CUSTOMER FINANCING WITH

TRANS WORLD AIRLINES (TWA), PRINCIPALLY AIRCRAFT UNDER OPERATING LEASE. TWA HAS

UNDERGONE BANKRUPTCY PROCEEDINGS, AS PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED IN THE COMMERCIAL

33

34

AIRPLANES OPERATING EARNINGS SECTION. BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL

POSITION IN THESE ASSETS, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE OUTCOME OF THE

TWA PROCEEDINGS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL

FINANCING/OTHER SEGMENT FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES CHARGED DIRECTLY TO EARNINGS INCLUDE

DESIGN, DEVELOPMENTAL AND RELATED TEST ACTIVITIES FOR NEW AND DERIVATIVE

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT, OTHER COMPANY-SPONSORED PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND BASIC

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, INCLUDING AMOUNTS ALLOCABLE AS OVERHEAD COSTS ON U.S.

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE.

[GRAPHIC AND IMAGE MATERIAL ITEM NUMBER 4

SEE APPENDIX ON PAGE 113 FOR DESCRIPTION]

IN 2000, TOTAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT WAS $1,998 MILLION, COMPARED WITH

$1,341 MILLION IN 1999 AND $1,895 MILLION IN 1998. THE AMOUNT EXPENSED IN 2000

INCLUDED $557 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

(IPR&D;) DISCUSSED BELOW.

EXCLUDING IPR&D;, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT INCREASED $100 MILLION IN 2000,

PRINCIPALLY DUE TO INCREASES FROM THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT. IN

1999, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT DECLINED IN EACH OPERATING GROUP RELATIVE TO

1998. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DECLINE IN 1999 WAS ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANES SEGMENT AND RELATED TO THE TIMING OF MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS.

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN 2000 WAS ESSENTIALLY

UNCHANGED FROM 1999, BUT REFLECTED REDUCED SPENDING ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE 767-

400ER AND 717 PROGRAMS, AND INCREASED SPENDING ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE DEVELOPMENT

OF TWO LONGER-RANGE 777 MODELS.

THE PRINCIPAL COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS DURING THE 1998-

2000 PERIOD WERE THE 767-400ER, THE NEXT-GENERATION 737 FAMILY, THE 717

PROGRAM, THE 757-300 DERIVATIVE, AND THE 777-300 WIDE-BODY TWINJET DERIVATIVE.

THE INITIAL DELIVERY OF THE 767-400ER, A STRETCHED VERSION OF 767-300ER,

OCCURRED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2000. CERTIFICATION AND FIRST DELIVERIES OF

THE 737-700, THE FIRST OF FOUR NEW 737 DERIVATIVE MODELS, OCCURRED IN DECEMBER

1997. CERTIFICATION AND FIRST DELIVERY OF THE 737-800 AND 737-600 OCCURRED IN

1998. THE 737-900, THE LONGEST MEMBER OF THE NEXT-GENERATION 737 FAMILY,

RECEIVED ITS FIRST ORDER IN LATE 1997, WITH FIRST DELIVERY SCHEDULED FOR 2001.

FIRST DELIVERY OF THE 717 OCCURRED IN SEPTEMBER 1999. FIRST DELIVERY OF THE

757-300, A STRETCHED DERIVATIVE OF THE 757-200, OCCURRED IN MARCH 1999. FIRST

DELIVERY OF THE INCREASED-CAPACITY 777-300 DERIVATIVE OCCURRED IN MAY 1998.

THE FOLLOWING CHART SUMMARIZES THE TIME HORIZON BETWEEN GO-AHEAD AND

CERTIFICATION/INITIAL DELIVERY FOR MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES DERIVATIVES AND

PROGRAMS.

[GRAPHIC AND IMAGE MATERIAL ITEM NUMBER 5

SEE APPENDIX ON PAGE 113 FOR DESCRIPTION]

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES

THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES SEGMENT CONTINUES TO PURSUE BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES WHERE IT CAN USE ITS CUSTOMER KNOWLEDGE, TECHNICAL STRENGTH AND

LARGE-SCALE INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES. THE SEGMENT'S LEVEL OF RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS APPROACH, AND REFLECTS THE

34

35

RECENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, WHICH HAS PRESENTED FEW MAJOR NEW-START

OPPORTUNITIES. CURRENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE FOCUSED ON

WINNING THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER ENGINEERING, MANUFACTURING AND DEVELOPMENT

CONTRACT.  OTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS INCLUDE UPGRADE AND

TECHNOLOGY INSERTIONS TO ENHANCE THE CAPABILITY AND COMPETITIVENESS OF CURRENT

PRODUCT LINES, AS WELL AS EXPLORATION OF NEW MARKETS SUCH AS UNMANNED AIR

VEHICLES (UAVS).

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

THERE CONTINUED TO BE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AT THE

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT IN 2000.  RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENDITURES SUPPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DELTA IV LAUNCH VEHICLE, THE NEW

737-BASED AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING AND CONTROL AIRCRAFT, AND THE AIRCRAFT

INTERNET-BASED DATA SERVICE CONNEXION BY BOEINGSM.  DELTA IV DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE

HAS BEEN REDUCED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT'S PARTICIPATION IN DEVELOPING THE

EVOLVED EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE (EELV).

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE FAIR VALUE AMOUNT OF $500 MILLION OF IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

(IPR&D;) ATTRIBUTED TO THE HUGHES ACQUISITION DISCUSSED BELOW WAS DETERMINED BY

AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION USING THE INCOME APPROACH.

THIRTEEN PROJECTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE VALUATION, OF WHICH THE PRINCIPAL

PROJECTS WERE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING: TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH-

EFFICIENCY SOLAR CELLS AND SATELLITE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY ($189 MILLION), PHASED

ARRAY AND DIGITAL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND SERVICE

($89 MILLION), AND XENON-ION SYSTEMS FOR SATELLITE ENGINE PROPULSION ($82

MILLION). THE FAIR VALUE OF IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES WAS ALSO DETERMINED BY AN

INDEPENDENT VALUATION PRIMARILY USING THE INCOME APPROACH. THE FOLLOWING RISK-

ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATES WERE USED TO DISCOUNT THE PROJECT CASH FLOWS: SOLAR

CELLS AND SATELLITE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY, 17%; PHASED ARRAY AND DIGITAL

PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND SERVICE, 18%; XENON-ION

SYSTEMS FOR SATELLITE ENGINE PROPULSION, 18%; ALL OTHER PROJECTS, 18.2%

WEIGHTED AVERAGE.  OPERATING MARGINS WERE ASSUMED TO BE SIMILAR TO HISTORICAL

MARGINS OF SIMILAR PRODUCTS. THE SIZE OF THE APPLICABLE MARKET WAS VERIFIED FOR

REASONABLENESS WITH OUTSIDE RESEARCH SOURCES. THE PROJECTS WERE IN VARIOUS

STAGES OF COMPLETION RANGING FROM APPROXIMATELY 31% TO 92% COMPLETE AS OF THE

VALUATION DATE, WITH SPECIFIC PERCENTAGES COMPLETE BY PROJECT AS FOLLOWS: SOLAR

CELLS AND SATELLITE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY, 49%; PHASED ARRAY AND DIGITAL

PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY, 87%; XENON-ION SYSTEMS FOR SATELLITE ENGINE PROPULSION,

82%. THE STAGE OF COMPLETION FOR EACH PROJECT WAS ESTIMATED BY EVALUATING THE

COST TO COMPLETE, COMPLEXITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND TIME TO MARKET. THE PROJECTS

ARE ANTICIPATED TO BE COMPLETED BETWEEN 2001 AND 2003. THE ESTIMATED COST TO

COMPLETE THE PROJECTS IS $80 MILLION.

THE DISCOUNT RATES STATED PREVIOUSLY ARE HIGHER THAN THE COMPANY'S WEIGHTED

AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES IN THE ESTIMATES

DESCRIBED PREVIOUSLY, INCLUDING THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE SUCCESSFUL

COMPLETION OF THE PURCHASED IN-PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, THE USEFUL LIFE OF SUCH

TECHNOLOGY, THE PROFITABILITY LEVELS OF SUCH TECHNOLOGY AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF

THE TIMING OF THE RELATED PRODUCT INTRODUCTION AND THEN-EXISTING COMPETING

PRODUCTS. IF THESE PROJECTS ARE NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED, THE FUTURE REVENUE

AND PROFITABILITY OF BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

ADDITIONALLY, THE VALUE OF THE OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED MAY BECOME

IMPAIRED.

35

36

THE FAIR VALUE AMOUNT OF $45 MILLION OF IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

(IPR&D;) ATTRIBUTED TO THE ACQUISITION OF JEPPESEN SANDERSON INC., WAS

DETERMINED BY AN INDEPENDENT VALUATION.  THE ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT TECHNOLOGY CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THREE SOFTWARE PROJECTS THAT WILL

WORK TOGETHER TO STORE INFORMATION AND EXTRACT IT FOR USE IN VARIOUS PRODUCTS

SOLD BY JEPPESEN.  THE TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW THE MANUFACTURE OF END USER

AERONAUTICAL INFORMATION BOTH BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN TIME, AND WILL ALLOW

THE EXTRACTION OF THE INFORMATION ON A NEAR REAL-TIME BASIS.  FURTHERMORE, THE

TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW THE CREATION OF PACKAGES OF AERONAUTICAL INFORMATION

DERIVED FROM A SINGLE SOURCE OF DATABASE INFORMATION, WHICH CAN BE TAILORED TO

INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR CAN BE PACKAGED AS A NEW PRODUCT.  THESE DATABASE AND

EXTRACTION CAPABILITIES ARE REQUIRED IN DEVELOPING NEW AND ENHANCED CHARTING

AND MAPPING PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE.  THESE ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETE BY MID-2001;

HOWEVER, FULL RANGE AND PRODUCTION OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS ANTICIPATED IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. THE TECHNOLOGY, ONCE COMPLETED, CAN ONLY BE USED FOR ITS

SPECIFIC AND INTENDED PURPOSE AND AS SUCH NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES EXIST.

THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY WAS DETERMINED USING THE INCOME APPROACH, AND A RISK-

ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE OF 15% WAS USED TO DISCOUNT THE PROJECT CASH FLOW.  AS

OF THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION, JEPPESEN HAD INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $14 MILLION

IN COSTS RELATED TO IPR&D; PROJECTS.  THE ESTIMATED COST TO COMPLETE THE

PROJECTS IS  $7 MILLION.

OTHER ACQUISITIONS RESULTING IN THE RECOGNITION OF IPR&D; DURING 2000 USING A

SIMILAR INCOME APPROACH INCLUDED CONTINENTAL GRAPHICS CORP. ($7 MILLION IPR&D;)

AND AUTOMETRIC, INC. ($5 MILLION IPR&D;).

TOTAL COMPANY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES FOR 2001 WILL BE

INFLUENCED BY THE TIMING OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS AND

COMMERCIAL SPACE AND COMMUNICATION ACTIVITIES. BASED ON CURRENT PROGRAMS AND

PLANS, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE FOR 2001 IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE RANGE

OF 3.0% TO 3.5% OF TOTAL REVENUES. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE

FURTHER DISCUSSED IN THE STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS FOR LONG-TERM VALUE SECTION ON

PAGE 51.

INCOME TAXES

THE 2000 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 29.0% VARIES FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY

TAX RATE OF 35%, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO FOREIGN SALES CORPORATION (FSC) TAX

BENEFITS OF $291 MILLION. OFFSETTING THIS BENEFIT ARE STATE INCOME TAXES AND

THE NON-DEDUCTIBILITY OF CERTAIN GOODWILL, PRINCIPALLY THE GOODWILL ACQUIRED BY

THE ACQUISITION OF THE AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE UNITS FROM ROCKWELL INTERNATIONAL

CORPORATION IN 1996.

THE 1999 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 30.5% VARIES FROM THE FEDERAL

STATUTORY TAX RATE FOR THE SAME REASONS THAT APPLY TO THE 2000 RATE. THE

RELATIVELY SMALLER REDUCTION FROM THE STATUTORY RATE IN 1999 RELATIVE TO 2000

RESULTS PRINCIPALLY FROM LOWER FSC TAX BENEFITS IN 1999 ($230 MILLION) AND THE

APPLICATION OF NET TAX CREDITS TO A LARGER PRETAX EARNINGS AMOUNT ($3.3 BILLION

IN 1999 COMPARED WITH $3.0 BILLION IN 2000).

THE 1998 EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 19.8% REFLECTS THE SETTLEMENT OF PRIOR

YEARS' DEFENSE-RELATED PARTNERSHIP RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS OF $57

MILLION, AS WELL AS FSC TAX BENEFITS OF $130 MILLION. THESE CREDITS RESULTED IN

A LOWER EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IN 1998 SINCE THEY WERE APPLIED TO A SIGNIFICANTLY

SMALLER PRETAX EARNINGS AMOUNT ($1.4 BILLION IN 1998 COMPARED WITH $3.3 BILLION

IN 1999).

IN RESPONSE TO AN ADVERSE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) FINDING RELATIVE TO

THE U.S. FSC TAX PROVISIONS, THE U.S. REPEALED FSC AND ENACTED REPLACEMENT

LEGISLATION (EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME EXCLUSION ACT OF 2000).  THE EUROPEAN

UNION HAS FILED A WTO CHALLENGE TO THE NEW LAW.  IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT

WHAT IMPACT, IF ANY, THIS ISSUE WILL HAVE ON FUTURE EARNINGS PENDING FINAL

RESOLUTION OF THE CHALLENGE.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION RELATING TO INCOME TAXES IS FOUND IN NOTE 13 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON PAGES 77-79.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

-------------------------------

THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE COMPANY'S INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS AND

LIQUIDITY POSITION, OTHER THAN OPERATING RESULTS ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT SALES

ACTIVITY, INCLUDE THE TIMING OF NEW AND DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRING BOTH HIGH

DEVELOPMENTAL EXPENDITURES AND INITIAL INVENTORY BUILDUP, CYCLICAL GROWTH AND

EXPANSION REQUIREMENTS, CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSISTANCE, THE TIMING OF FEDERAL

INCOME TAX PAYMENTS, THE COMPANY'S STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN, AND POTENTIAL

ACQUISITIONS.

CASH FLOW SUMMARY

FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF COMPANY CASH FLOWS BASED ON CHANGES IN CASH AND

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. THIS CASH FLOW SUMMARY IS NOT INTENDED TO REPLACE THE

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF CASH FLOWS ON PAGE 60 THAT ARE PREPARED IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, BUT IS INTENDED TO

HIGHLIGHT AND FACILITATE UNDERSTANDING OF THE PRINCIPAL CASH FLOW ELEMENTS.

FREE CASH FLOW IS DEFINED AS CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS LESS CHANGE IN SHORT-

TERM INVESTMENTS, REDUCED BY FACILITIES AND EQUIPMENT EXPENDITURES.

==============================================================

(A)     NON-CASH CHARGES TO EARNINGS AS PRESENTED HERE CONSIST OF DEPRECIATION,

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, AMORTIZATION, RETIREE HEALTH CARE

ACCRUALS, CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING VALUATION PROVISION AND

SHARE-BASED PLANS EXPENSE. THE COMPANY HAS NOT FUNDED RETIREE HEALTH

CARE ACCRUALS AND, AT THIS TIME, HAS NO PLAN TO FUND THESE ACCRUALS IN

THE FUTURE. THE SHARE-BASED PLANS DO NOT IMPACT CURRENT OR FUTURE CASH

FLOW, EXCEPT FOR THE ASSOCIATED POSITIVE CASH FLOW TAX IMPLICATIONS.

SHARE-BASED PLANS EXPENSE IS PROJECTED TO INCREASE IN THE NEAR TERM AS

ADDITIONAL ANNUAL PERFORMANCE SHARE GRANTS ARE MADE. SEE NOTE 18 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

(B)     NEXT-GENERATION 737 PROGRAM INVENTORY INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY DURING

1998 AND 1999.  INVENTORY BALANCES ON THE 747, 757 AND 767 COMMERCIAL

JET PROGRAMS INCREASED IN 1998 DUE TO INCREASED PRODUCTION RATES, BUT

THE 737 CLASSIC INVENTORY DECREASED IN 1998. THE 777 PROGRAM INVENTORY

ALSO DECREASED IN 1998, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO REDUCTION OF UNAMORTIZED

TOOLING AND DEFERRED PRODUCTION COSTS. THE DECREASE IN INVENTORY IN

1999 RESULTED PRINCIPALLY FROM DECREASED PRODUCTION RATES ON THE 777

AND 747 PROGRAMS AND IMPROVED INVENTORY CYCLE TIME. THE DECREASE IN

INVENTORY IN 2000 ALSO RESULTED FROM DECREASED PRODUCTION RATES AND

IMPROVED INVENTORY TURNS.

(C)     THE CHANGES IN COMMERCIAL CUSTOMER ADVANCES DURING 1998, 1999 AND 2000

WERE BROADLY DISTRIBUTED AMONG THE COMMERCIAL JET PROGRAMS, AND

GENERALLY CORRESPOND TO ORDERS AND PRODUCTION RATE LEVELS. WITH REGARD

TO THE AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES SEGMENT AND SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

SEGMENT ACTIVITY, THE RATIO OF PROGRESS BILLINGS TO GROSS INVENTORY DID

NOT SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE DURING THIS PERIOD.

39

40

(D)     THE TOTAL CHANGE IN RECEIVABLES, LIABILITIES, DEFERRED INCOME TAXES

AND OTHER RESULTED IN A NET ASSET INCREASE OF $0.7 BILLION FOR THE

THREE-YEAR PERIOD PRESENTED.  THE NET INCREASE IN CASH ATTRIBUTABLE TO

CHANGES IN INCOME TAXES PAYABLE AND DEFERRED WAS $1.0 BILLION.

EXCLUDING POTENTIAL TAX SETTLEMENTS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 13 TO THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, FEDERAL INCOME TAX PAYMENTS IN 2001

ARE PROJECTED TO SUBSTANTIALLY EXCEED INCOME TAX EXPENSE DUE TO

COMPLETION OF CONTRACTS EXECUTED UNDER PRIOR TAX REGULATIONS. THE

COMPANY PROJECTS THAT THE SEA LAUNCH JOINT VENTURE WILL REQUIRE

ADDITIONAL INFUSIONS FROM THE PARTNERS DURING 2001.  THIS IS EXPECTED

TO RESULT IN ADDITIONAL CASH REQUIREMENTS AND-OR LOAN GUARANTEES

IMPOSED ON THE COMPANY.

(E)     PROCEEDS FROM DISPOSITIONS INCLUDE RECEIPTS FROM THE SALE OF

SUBSIDIARIES AND THE SALE OF REAL PROPERTY.  INCLUDED IN THE PROCEEDS

FOR 1999 ARE RECEIPTS OF APPROXIMATELY $162 MILLION RELATED TO THE

SALE OF BOEING INFORMATION SYSTEMS.

(F)     THE CHANGES IN CUSTOMER FINANCING BALANCES HAVE BEEN LARGELY DRIVEN BY

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT MARKET CONDITIONS.  OVER THE THREE-YEAR PERIOD 1998-

2000, THE COMPANY GENERATED $4.6 BILLION OF CASH FROM PRINCIPAL

REPAYMENTS AND BY SELLING CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND OPERATING

LEASE ASSETS. OVER THE SAME PERIOD, ADDITIONS TO CUSTOMER FINANCING

AMOUNTED TO $7.7 BILLION. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE COMPANY HAD

OUTSTANDING COMMITMENTS OF APPROXIMATELY $6.0 BILLION TO ARRANGE OR

PROVIDE FINANCING RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER OR UNDER OPTION FOR

DELIVERIES SCHEDULED THROUGH THE YEAR 2005. NOT ALL THESE COMMITMENTS

ARE LIKELY TO BE USED; HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE

COMMITMENTS IS WITH PARTIES WITH RELATIVELY LOW CREDIT RATINGS.  SEE

NOTE 21 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONCERNING

CONCENTRATION OF CREDIT RISK.  OUTSTANDING LOANS AND COMMITMENTS ARE

PRIMARILY SECURED BY THE UNDERLYING AIRCRAFT.

(G)     DEBT MATURITY DURING THIS THREE-YEAR PERIOD INCLUDED $200 MILLION IN

2000, $650 MILLION IN 1999, AND $300 MILLION IN 1998, AND $300 MILLION

WAS ADDED IN 1998 WITH MATURITY IN 2038.  ADDITIONALLY, BOEING CAPITAL

CORPORATION (BCC), A CORPORATION WHOLLY OWNED BY THE COMPANY, ISSUED

$2.0 BILLION OF DEBT IN 2000, $400 MILLION OF DEBT IN 1999 AND $511

MILLION IN 1998.  THE SIGNIFICANT BCC DEBT ISSUANCE IN 2000 WAS

PERFORMED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TRANSFER OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF

THE COMPANY'S CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSETS TO BCC.

(H)     IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 1998, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED A SHARE REPURCHASE

PROGRAM TO BUY UP TO 15% OF THE COMPANY'S OUTSTANDING SHARES OF COMMON

STOCK. THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 35.2 MILLION SHARES OF STOCK FOR $1.3

BILLION IN 1998, 68.9 MILLION SHARES FOR $2.9 BILLION IN 1999, AND 41.8

MILLION SHARES FOR $2.4 BILLION IN 2000, WHICH COMPLETED THE SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM. IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2000, THE COMPANY

AUTHORIZED AN ADDITIONAL SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM FOR UP TO 85 MILLION

ADDITIONAL SHARES.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

THE COMPANY HAS LONG-TERM DEBT OBLIGATIONS OF $7.6 BILLION, WHICH ARE

UNSECURED. APPROXIMATELY $538 MILLION MATURE IN 2001, AND THE BALANCE HAS AN

AVERAGE MATURITY OF 12.7 YEARS. EXCLUDING BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION (BCC), A

FINANCING SUBSIDIARY WHOLLY OWNED BY THE COMPANY, TOTAL LONG-TERM DEBT IS AT

40

41

30% OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY PLUS DEBT. THE CONSOLIDATED LONG-TERM DEBT,

INCLUDING BCC, IS AT 44% OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY PLUS DEBT.  THE COMPANY

HAS SUBSTANTIAL ADDITIONAL LONG-TERM BORROWING CAPABILITY. REVOLVING CREDIT

LINE AGREEMENTS WITH A GROUP OF MAJOR BANKS, TOTALING $3.0 BILLION, REMAIN

AVAILABLE BUT UNUSED.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS INTERNALLY GENERATED LIQUIDITY,

TOGETHER WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL CAPITAL RESOURCES, WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO

SATISFY EXISTING COMMITMENTS AND PLANS, AND ALSO TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE FINANCIAL

FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF POTENTIAL STRATEGIC BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES

SHOULD THEY ARISE WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR.

CONTINGENT ITEMS

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS,

CONTRACTS AND OTHER MATTERS ARE PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY. MOST SIGNIFICANT

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO MATTERS COVERED BY INSURANCE. MAJOR

CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF

THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THOSE FOR DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND

REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES. DUE IN PART TO THEIR COMPLEXITY AND

PERVASIVENESS, SUCH REQUIREMENTS HAVE RESULTED IN THE COMPANY BEING INVOLVED

WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS SINCE THE

1980S.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES, BASED ON IN-DEPTH STUDIES, EXPERT ANALYSES

AND LEGAL REVIEWS, ITS CONTINGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS FOR

REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RANGES AND

PROBABILITIES OF RECOVERIES FROM OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO HAVE AND HAVE

NOT AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT AND OF RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS. THE

COMPANY'S POLICY IS TO IMMEDIATELY ACCRUE AND CHARGE TO CURRENT EXPENSE

IDENTIFIED EXPOSURES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SITES BASED ON

CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES OF INVESTIGATION, CLEANUP AND MONITORING COSTS TO BE

INCURRED.

THE COSTS INCURRED AND EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH

ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT HAD, AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE

COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION.  WITH RESPECT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, RELATED

CHARGES HAVE AVERAGED LESS THAN 2% OF ANNUAL NET EARNINGS.  SUCH ACCRUALS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2000, WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR THE RELATED CONTINGENT RECOVERIES

FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS, ARE LESS THAN 2% OF TOTAL LIABILITIES.

BECAUSE OF THE REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES AND RISK OF UNIDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED

SITES AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

COSTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTIMATED COSTS ACCRUED FOR

IDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED SITES. HOWEVER, BASED ON ALL KNOWN FACTS AND EXPERT

ANALYSES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS NOT REASONABLY LIKELY THAT IDENTIFIED

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR OPERATING

RESULTS AND CASH FLOW TRENDS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OF ITS PRACTICES

FROM WHICH CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT. SUCH

PROCEEDINGS COULD INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES,

COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION AND/OR FORFEITURES.  UNDER

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, A COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS OPERATING DIVISIONS OR

SUBDIVISIONS, CAN ALSO BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, OR

LOSE ITS EXPORT PRIVILEGES, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY

41

42

BELIEVES, BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH

GOVERNMENT DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION OR CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

IN 1991, THE U.S. NAVY NOTIFIED THE COMPANY AND GENERAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION

(THE TEAM) THAT IT WAS TERMINATING FOR DEFAULT THE TEAM'S CONTRACT FOR

DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE A-12 AIRCRAFT. THE TEAM FILED A LEGAL

ACTION TO CONTEST THE NAVY'S DEFAULT TERMINATION, TO ASSERT ITS RIGHTS TO

CONVERT THE TERMINATION TO ONE FOR "THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT," AND TO

OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COSTS INCURRED ON THE A-12 CONTRACT BUT NOT

PAID TO DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, INVENTORIES INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $581

MILLION OF RECORDED COSTS ON THE A-12 CONTRACT, AGAINST WHICH THE COMPANY HAS

ESTABLISHED A LOSS PROVISION OF $350 MILLION. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVISION,

WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1990, WAS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S BELIEF, SUPPORTED BY

AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WOULD BE

CONVERTED TO A TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, THAT THE TEAM WOULD ESTABLISH A

CLAIM FOR CONTRACT ADJUSTMENTS FOR A MINIMUM OF $250 MILLION, THAT THERE WAS A

RANGE OF REASONABLY POSSIBLE RESULTS ON TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, AND THAT

IT WAS PRUDENT TO PROVIDE FOR WHAT THE COMPANY THEN BELIEVED WAS THE UPPER

RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS ON TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, WHICH WAS $350 MILLION.

ON JULY 1, 1999, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

REVERSED A MARCH 31, 1998, JUDGMENT OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL

CLAIMS FOR THE TEAM. THE 1998 JUDGMENT WAS BASED ON A DETERMINATION THAT THE

GOVERNMENT HAD NOT EXERCISED THE REQUIRED DISCRETION BEFORE ISSUING A

TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT. IT CONVERTED THE TERMINATION TO A TERMINATION FOR

CONVENIENCE, AND DETERMINED THE TEAM WAS ENTITLED TO BE PAID $1,200 MILLION,

PLUS STATUTORY INTEREST FROM JUNE 26, 1991, UNTIL PAID. THE COURT OF APPEALS

REMANDED THE CASE TO THE COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS FOR A DETERMINATION AS TO

WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT IS ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE BURDEN OF SHOWING A DEFAULT WAS

JUSTIFIED AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS. TRIAL ON ALL ISSUES NOW IS SET FOR MAY 1,

2001. FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE A-12 LITIGATION WILL DEPEND ON THE OUTCOME OF

SUCH TRIAL AND POSSIBLE FURTHER APPEALS OR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

IN THE COMPANY'S OPINION, THE LOSS PROVISION CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY

FOR THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE REDUCTION IN VALUE OF A-12 NET CONTRACTS IN PROCESS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, AS A RESULT OF A TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT FOR THE

CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN PROVIDED WITH AN OPINION OF

OUTSIDE COUNSEL THAT (I) THE GOVERNMENT'S TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT FOR

DEFAULT WAS CONTRARY TO LAW AND FACT, (II) THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE

COMPANY ARE THE SAME AS IF THE TERMINATION HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR THE CONVENIENCE

OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND (III) SUBJECT TO PREVAILING ON THE ISSUE THAT THE

TERMINATION IS PROPERLY ONE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE PROBABLE

RECOVERY BY THE COMPANY IS NOT LESS THAN $250 MILLION.

ON OCTOBER 31, 1997, A FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWSUIT WAS FILED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, IN

SEATTLE. THE LAWSUIT NAMES AS DEFENDANTS THE COMPANY AND THREE OF ITS THEN

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS OF A SIMILAR NATURE HAVE BEEN FILED IN

THE SAME COURT. THESE LAWSUITS WERE CONSOLIDATED ON FEBRUARY 24, 1998. THE

LAWSUITS GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS DESIRED TO KEEP THE COMPANY'S

SHARE PRICE AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE MCDONNELL DOUGLAS

SHAREHOLDERS WOULD APPROVE THE MERGER AND, IN THE CASE OF THE INDIVIDUAL

DEFENDANTS, TO BENEFIT DIRECTLY FROM THE SALE OF BOEING STOCK DURING THE PERIOD

FROM APRIL 7, 1997 THROUGH OCTOBER 22, 1997. BY ORDER DATED MAY 1, 2000, THE

COURT CERTIFIED TWO SUBCLASSES OF PLAINTIFFS IN THE ACTION: A. ALL PERSONS OR

ENTITIES WHO PURCHASED BOEING STOCK OR CALL OPTIONS OR WHO SOLD PUT OPTIONS

42

43

DURING THE PERIOD FROM JULY 21, 1997 , THROUGH OCTOBER 22, 1997, AND B. ALL

PERSONS OR ENTITIES WHO PURCHASED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS STOCK ON OR AFTER APRIL 7,

1997, AND WHO HELD SUCH STOCK UNTIL IT CONVERTED TO BOEING STOCK PURSUANT TO

THE MERGER. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND TREBLE DAMAGES. THE

ACTION NOW IS SET FOR TRIAL ON MARCH 7, 2002. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE

ALLEGATIONS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND THAT THE OUTCOME OF THESE LAWSUITS WILL NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS EARNINGS, CASH FLOW OR FINANCIAL

POSITION.

ON OCTOBER 19, 1999, AN INDICTMENT WAS RETURNED BY A FEDERAL GRAND JURY

SITTING IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CHARGING THAT MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION

(MDC), A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, AND MDC'S DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT

COMPANY DIVISION, CONSPIRED TO AND MADE FALSE STATEMENTS AND CONCEALED MATERIAL

FACTS ON EXPORT LICENSE APPLICATIONS AND IN CONNECTION WITH EXPORT LICENSES,

AND POSSESSED AND SOLD MACHINE TOOLS IN VIOLATION OF THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION

ACT. THE INDICTMENT ALSO CHARGED ONE EMPLOYEE WITH PARTICIPATION IN THE ALLEGED

CONSPIRACY. (THE INDICTMENT HAS SINCE BEEN DISMISSED AS AGAINST THAT EMPLOYEE

BUT HIS DISMISSAL IS THE SUBJECT OF A PENDING APPEAL BY THE GOVERNMENT TO THE

U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT.) THE INDICTMENT RELATES TO THE SALE

AND EXPORT TO CHINA IN 1993-1995 OF SURPLUS, USED MACHINE TOOLS SOLD BY DOUGLAS

AIRCRAFT COMPANY TO CHINA NATIONAL AERO-TECHNOLOGY IMPORT AND EXPORT

CORPORATION FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH THE MD-80/90 COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

TRUNKLINER PROGRAM IN CHINA.

AS A RESULT OF THE INDICTMENT, THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HAS DISCRETION TO

DENY DEFENSE-RELATED EXPORT PRIVILEGES TO MDC OR A DIVISION OR SUBSIDIARY OF

MDC. THE AGENCY EXERCISED THAT DISCRETION ON JANUARY 5, 2000, BY ESTABLISHING A

"DENIAL POLICY" WITH RESPECT TO DEFENSE-RELATED EXPORTS OF MDC AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES. MOST OF MDC'S MAJOR EXISTING DEFENSE PROGRAMS WERE, HOWEVER,

EXCEPTED FROM THAT POLICY DUE TO OVERRIDING U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL

SECURITY INTERESTS. OTHER EXCEPTIONS HAVE BEEN GRANTED. THERE CAN, HOWEVER, BE

NO ASSURANCE AS TO HOW THE DEPARTMENT WILL EXERCISE ITS DISCRETION AS TO

PROGRAM OR TRANSACTION EXCEPTIONS FOR OTHER PROGRAMS OR FUTURE DEFENSE-RELATED

EXPORTS. IN ADDITION, THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE HAS AUTHORITY TO TEMPORARILY

DENY OTHER EXPORT PRIVILEGES TO, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAS AUTHORITY TO

SUSPEND OR DEBAR FROM CONTRACTING WITH THE MILITARY DEPARTMENTS, MDC OR A

DIVISION OR SUBSIDIARY OF MDC. NEITHER AGENCY HAS TAKEN ACTION ADVERSE TO MDC

OR ITS DIVISIONS OR SUBSIDIARIES THUS FAR. BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE

INFORMATION, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT ACTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION OR CONTINUING OPERATIONS. IN THE

UNANTICIPATED EVENT OF A CONVICTION, MDC WOULD BE SUBJECT TO DEPARTMENT OF

STATE AND DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DENIALS OR REVOCATIONS OF MDC EXPORT LICENSES.

MDC ALSO WOULD BE SUBJECT TO DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE DEBARMENT PROCEEDINGS.

ON FEBRUARY 25, 2000, A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ALLEGING GENDER

DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT WAS FILED AGAINST THE BOEING COMPANY, BOEING

NORTH AMERICAN, INC., AND MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION. THE COMPLAINT, FILED

WITH THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE, ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY HAS

ENGAGED IN A PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT AND

RETALIATION AGAINST FEMALES OVER THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS. THE COMPLAINT, BECK

V. BOEING, NAMES 28 WOMEN WHO HAVE WORKED FOR BOEING IN THE PUGET SOUND AREA;

WICHITA, KANSAS; ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI; AND TULSA, OKLAHOMA. ON MARCH 15, AN

AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED NAMING AN ADDITIONAL 10 PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING THE

FIRST FROM CALIFORNIA. THE LAWSUIT ATTEMPTS TO REPRESENT ALL WOMEN WHO

CURRENTLY WORK FOR THE COMPANY, OR WHO HAVE WORKED FOR THE COMPANY IN THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS (APPROXIMATELY 70,000).

43

44

THE COMPANY HAS DENIED THE ALLEGATION THAT IT HAS ENGAGED IN ANY UNLAWFUL

"PATTERN AND PRACTICE" AND BELIEVES THAT THE PLAINTIFFS CANNOT SATISFY THE

RIGOROUS REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE CLASS ACTION STATUS THEY SEEK.

THE DEADLINE FOR FILING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION, ORIGINALLY

SCHEDULED TO BE HEARD ON AUGUST 25, 2000, NOW HAS BEEN EXTENDED UNTIL MAY 2001.

THE COMPANY INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY CONTEST THIS LAWSUIT.

IN OCTOBER 1999, A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS FILED A FEDERAL COURT

ACTION ALLEGING EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION BASED UPON RACE AND NATIONAL (SIC)

ORIGIN (ASIAN). THIS ACTION WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CONSOLIDATED WITH A RELATED SUIT

MAKING SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS AND CLASS ACTION STATUS WAS SOUGHT IN A MOTION FILED

ON JANUARY 3, 2001. THE CLASS FOR WHICH CERTIFICATION IS BEING SOUGHT WOULD

INCLUDE ALL NON-MANAGEMENT SALARIED WORKERS OF ASIAN DESCENT EMPLOYED IN

WASHINGTON STATE. THE ACTION IS LIMITED TO CLAIMS OF ALLEGED DISCRIMINATION IN

COMPENSATION, PROMOTION, TRANSFER, RETENTION RATING, AND JOB CLASSIFICATION.

THE COMPANY HAS DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS OF DISCRIMINATION AND PLANS TO OPPOSE

THE MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION AND VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THE LAWSUIT. THE

COURT'S DECISION ON CLASS CERTIFICATION IS ANTICIPATED TO BE ISSUED AS EARLY AS

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2001.

ENERGY COSTS IN SUPPORT OF PRODUCTION

DURING LATE 2000 AND EARLY 2001, THE COMPANY EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT INCREASES

IN ENERGY COSTS, SPECIFICALLY ELECTRICITY COSTS IN THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA

AREA. ALTHOUGH THESE INCREASES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE SUSTAINED FOR THE LONG

TERM, THE COMPANY COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED BY BOTH THE PROSPECT OF CONTINUED

HIGH ENERGY COSTS AND THE POTENTIAL OF MANDATED PRODUCTION CURTAILMENTS.

MARKET RISK EXPOSURE

THE COMPANY HAS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK,

PRINCIPALLY SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, FIXED-RATE NOTES RECEIVABLE ATTRIBUTABLE TO

CUSTOMER FINANCING, AND DEBT OBLIGATIONS ISSUED AT A FIXED RATE. HISTORICALLY,

THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED MATERIAL GAINS OR LOSSES DUE TO INTEREST RATE

CHANGES WHEN SELLING SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS OR FIXED-RATE NOTES RECEIVABLE.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO

INTEREST RATE CHANGES. BASED ON THE CURRENT HOLDINGS OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

AND FIXED-RATE NOTES, AS WELL AS UNDERLYING SWAPS, THE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST

RATE RISK IS NOT MATERIAL. FIXED-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY THE COMPANY

ARE GENERALLY NOT CALLABLE UNTIL MATURITY.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK RELATING TO

RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. AS A

GENERAL POLICY, THE COMPANY SUBSTANTIALLY HEDGES FOREIGN CURRENCY COMMITMENTS

OF FUTURE PAYMENTS AND RECEIPTS BY PURCHASING FOREIGN CURRENCY-FORWARD

CONTRACTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE NOTIONAL VALUE OF SUCH DERIVATIVES WAS

$484 MILLION, WITH A NET UNREALIZED LOSS OF $23 MILLION. LESS THAN 2% OF

RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES ARE CONTRACTED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES, AND THE COMPANY

DOES NOT CONSIDER THE MARKET RISK EXPOSURE RELATING TO CURRENCY EXCHANGE TO BE

MATERIAL.

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

----------------------------------------------------

THE WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR COMMERCIAL JET AIRPLANES IS PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY

LONG-TERM TRENDS IN AIRLINE PASSENGER TRAFFIC. THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS UNDERLYING

LONG-TERM TRAFFIC GROWTH ARE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH, BOTH IN DEVELOPED AND

EMERGING COUNTRIES, AND POLITICAL STABILITY. DEMAND FOR THE COMPANY'S

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES IS FURTHER INFLUENCED BY AIRLINE INDUSTRY PROFITABILITY,

WORLD TRADE POLICIES, GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL

CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED UPON AIRPLANE OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, AND PRICE

AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS.

GLOBAL ECONOMIC AND PASSENGER TRAFFIC TRENDS

AS THE MAJOR ECONOMIES OF THE WORLD EXPERIENCED ECONOMIC EXPANSION DURING THE

1990S AND IN 2000, AIRLINE PASSENGER TRAFFIC INCREASED.  ECONOMIC GROWTH

WORLDWIDE IN 2000 WAS ALMOST 50% ABOVE LONG-TERM AVERAGES.  THIS WAS LED BY

EXCEPTIONAL AND UNSUSTAINABLE PERFORMANCE IN THE U.S. ECONOMY.  FOR THE FIVE-

YEAR PERIOD 1996-2000, THE AVERAGE ANNUAL GROWTH RATE FOR WORLDWIDE PASSENGER

TRAFFIC WAS 5.6%.  THE COMPANY'S 20-YEAR FORECAST OF THE AVERAGE LONG-TERM

GROWTH RATE IN PASSENGER TRAFFIC IS 4.8% ANNUALLY, BASED ON PROJECTED AVERAGE

WORLDWIDE ANNUAL ECONOMIC REAL GROWTH OF 3.0%.  BASED ON GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH

PROJECTIONS OVER THE LONG TERM, AND TAKING INTO CONSIDERATION INCREASING

UTILIZATION LEVELS OF THE WORLDWIDE AIRPLANE FLEET AND REQUIREMENTS TO REPLACE

OLDER AIRPLANES, THE COMPANY PROJECTS THE TOTAL COMMERCIAL JET AIRPLANE MARKET

OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS AT APPROXIMATELY $1.5 TRILLION IN CURRENT DOLLARS.

ALTHOUGH THE ASIAN REGION HAS RECENTLY EXPERIENCED ECONOMIC DIFFICULTIES,

COMPANY FORECASTS INDICATE THAT THE AIRLINES IN THIS REGION, AND ESPECIALLY IN

CHINA, REPRESENT A SIGNIFICANT POTENTIAL MARKET FOR COMMERCIAL JET AIRPLANES

OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO SUPPORT THE ASIA PACIFIC

ECONOMIC COOPERATION (APEC) FORUM TO PROMOTE OPEN TRADE AND INVESTMENT IN THE

REGION. FOR OTHER COUNTRIES IN ASIA, ECONOMIC GROWTH MUST RETURN IF THE

POTENTIAL OF THE REGION IS TO BE REALIZED.

AIRLINES IN RUSSIA AND OTHER STATES IN THE FORMER SOVIET UNION OPERATE A

LIMITED BUT INCREASING NUMBER OF WESTERN-BUILT AIRPLANES. BECAUSE OF SLOW

ECONOMIC GROWTH, HIGH CUSTOMS DUTIES, A SHORTAGE OF FOREIGN EXCHANGE, AND LEGAL

AND FINANCING CONSTRAINTS, NEW AIRPLANE ORDERS HAVE NOT BEEN SIGNIFICANT. THE

COMPANY EXPECTS THAT THE AIRLINES AND THE AIRPLANE MANUFACTURING INDUSTRY IN

THIS REGION WILL EVENTUALLY BE INTEGRATED INTO THE INTERNATIONAL ECONOMY.

AIRLINE DEREGULATION

WORLDWIDE, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED PROGRESSIVE DEREGULATION OF

DOMESTIC MARKETS AND INCREASING LIBERALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETS.

TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO VIRTUALLY ALL AIR TRAVEL TOOK PLACE WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. SINCE THEN, AN INCREASING

NUMBER OF COUNTRIES, MOST NOTABLY THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, AND THE

COUNTRIES IN WESTERN EUROPE, HAVE ELIMINATED RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS FOR

DOMESTIC AIRLINE MARKETS AND PROMOTED A MORE OPEN-MARKET CLIMATE FOR

INTERNATIONAL SERVICES.  OTHER COUNTRIES SUCH AS JAPAN HAVE DEREGULATED THEIR

DOMESTIC MARKETS.  CURRENTLY, APPROXIMATELY ONE-HALF OF ALL AIR TRAVEL TAKES

PLACE WITHIN AN OPEN-MARKET ENVIRONMENT.  THESE TRENDS ARE EXPECTED TO

CONTINUE, BUT AT VARYING RATES IN DIFFERENT PARTS OF THE WORLD.  BY 2010, AN

ESTIMATED TWO-THIRDS OF AIR TRAVEL WILL BE IN OPEN MARKETS.  LIBERALIZATION OF

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, TOGETHER WITH INCREASED AIRPLANE RANGE CAPABILITIES,

GIVES AIRLINES GREATER FREEDOM TO PURSUE OPTIMAL FLEET-MIX STRATEGIES. THIS

45

46

INCREASED FLEXIBILITY ALLOWS THE AIRLINES TO ACCOMMODATE TRAFFIC GROWTH BY

SELECTING THE BEST MIX OF FLIGHT FREQUENCIES AND AIRPLANE SIZE AND CAPABILITIES

FOR THEIR ROUTE SYSTEMS.  IN INTERCONTINENTAL MARKETS, MORE LIBERAL BILATERAL

AIR SERVICE AGREEMENTS PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT STIMULUS TO OPENING NEW CITY-PAIR

MARKETS, WHICH FAVOR INCREASED FLIGHT FREQUENCY OVER CAPACITY GROWTH.  IN

PARALLEL WITH REGULATORY LIBERALIZATION, DEVELOPMENTS IN IMPROVING AIRPLANE

RANGE PERFORMANCE WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW AIRLINES TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF

DIRECT CITY-TO-CITY ROUTES, THUS REDUCING THE RELIANCE ON INDIRECT ROUTES

THROUGH CENTRAL HUBS THAT REQUIRE LARGER CAPACITY AIRPLANES.

AIRLINE INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT

THROUGH A COMBINATION OF PASSENGER TRAFFIC GROWTH, IMPROVED REVENUE, LOWER FUEL

COSTS AND AGGRESSIVE COST CONTROL MEASURES, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY AS A WHOLE

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVED OPERATING PROFITABILITY AND NET EARNINGS OVER THE FIVE-

YEAR PERIOD 1996-2000.  IN 2000, TRAFFIC GROWTH EXCEEDED LONG-RUN AVERAGES,

YIELDS IMPROVED, AND LOAD FACTOR REACHED HISTORIC HIGHS IN MANY AREAS OF THE

WORLD.  HOWEVER, THE SHARP INCREASE IN FUEL COSTS IN THE SECOND HALF OF 2000

DAMPENED THE POSITIVE EFFECT ON AIRLINE EARNINGS.  FORECASTS ARE FOR FUEL COSTS

TO MODERATE IN THE FUTURE.  THE OUTLOOK FOR PASSENGER TRAFFIC GROWTH IN 2001 IS

GENERALLY POSITIVE, ESPECIALLY IN THE UNITED STATES, EUROPE, MANY PARTS OF

ASIA, AND FOR TRANS-ATLANTIC FLIGHTS.  CONTINUED PROFITABILITY LEVELS DEPEND ON

SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH, LIMITED WAGE INCREASES, AND CAPACITY ADDITIONS IN

LINE WITH TRAFFIC INCREASES.

MANDATED NOISE LEVEL COMPLIANCE

A MANDATE WENT INTO EFFECT JANUARY 1, 2000, REQUIRING THAT ALL OPERATIONS INTO

AND OUT OF U.S. AIRPORTS MUST BE MADE WITH STAGE 3 NOISE LEVEL COMPLIANT

AIRPLANES. A SIMILAR MANDATE WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE IN MOST EUROPEAN AIRPORTS IN

APRIL 2002.  COMPLIANCE WITH THESE POLICIES CONTINUES TO BE A FACTOR FOR NEW

AIRPLANE DELIVERIES.  DURING 2001, THE INTERNATIONAL CIVIL AVIATION

ORGANIZATION (ICAO) WILL BE FORMULATING NEW NOISE LEVEL STANDARDS THAT WILL

INFLUENCE AIRPLANE MANUFACTURING AND MAY INFLUENCE RETROFITTING. THE COMPANY

SUPPORTS THE MISSION OF ICAO AND ENDORSES THE CONTINUING DEVELOPMENT OF

INTERNATIONAL NOISE STANDARDS.  THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT ADOPTION OF COMMON

STANDARDS WORLDWIDE WILL PROMOTE BOTH MEANINGFUL CONTROL OF NOISE POLLUTION AND

A HEALTHY ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT AROUND THE WORLD.

INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS

OVER THE PAST TEN YEARS, THE COMPANY HAS MAINTAINED, ON AVERAGE, APPROXIMATELY

A TWO-THIRDS SHARE OF THE AVAILABLE COMMERCIAL JET AIRPLANE MARKET. THE COMPANY

CURRENTLY FACES AGGRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS THAT ARE SEEKING TO

INCREASE MARKET SHARE. THIS COMPETITIVE FACTOR WAS RECENTLY DEMONSTRATED BY THE

PUBLIC DECISION OF AIRBUS TO INTRODUCE THE A380, A PROPOSED AIRCRAFT WITH

PASSENGER SEATING GREATER THAN THE 747, TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE AT THE UPPER

END OF THE LARGE AIRPLANE MARKET. THIS MARKET ENVIRONMENT HAS RESULTED IN

INTENSE PRESSURES ON PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS. THE COMPANY'S FOCUS

ON IMPROVING PROCESSES AND OTHER COST REDUCTION EFFORTS IS INTENDED TO ENHANCE

ITS ABILITY TO PURSUE PRICING STRATEGIES THAT ENABLE THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN

LEADERSHIP AT SATISFACTORY MARGINS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY'S EXTENSIVE

CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES NETWORK FOR AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD PLAYS A KEY

ROLE IN MAINTAINING HIGH CUSTOMER SATISFACTION.  AS AN EXAMPLE, ON-LINE ACCESS

IS AVAILABLE TO ALL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS FOR ENGINEERING DRAWINGS, PARTS LISTS,

SERVICE BULLETINS AND MAINTENANCE MANUALS.

46

47

IN JULY 2000, THREE MAJOR EUROPEAN AEROSPACE COMPANIES (AEROSPATIALE MATRA

OF FRANCE, DAIMLERCHRYSLER AEROSPACE OF GERMANY, AND CONSTRUCCIONES AERONAUTICA

OF SPAIN) COMBINED TO FORM THE EUROPEAN AERONAUTIC DEFENCE AND SPACE COMPANY

(EADS).  AS A RESULT OF THE FORMATION, EADS BECAME AN 80 PERCENT OWNER OF

AIRBUS INDUSTRIE (AI) AND IS LEADING THE EFFORT FOR THE FORMATION OF THE AIRBUS

INTEGRATED COMPANY (AIC) IN EARLY 2001.  THE CREATION OF THE AIC WILL

EFFECTIVELY CHANGE THE AIRBUS ROLE, FROM THAT OF A MARKETER/DISTRIBUTOR OF

LARGE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES TO ONE INCLUDING COMPLETE MANUFACTURING

RESPONSIBILITY.  THE AIC WILL BE INCORPORATED UNDER FRENCH LAW AS A PRIVATELY

HELD CORPORATION OWNED 80 PERCENT BY EADS AND 20 PERCENT BY BAE SYSTEMS.

OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS, SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR

APPROXIMATELY 53% OF THE COMPANY'S TOTAL COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT SALES;

APPROXIMATELY 43% OF THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG AT

YEAR-END 2000 WAS WITH CUSTOMERS BASED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.  CONTINUED

ACCESS TO GLOBAL MARKETS REMAINS VITAL TO THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO FULLY

REALIZE ITS SALES POTENTIAL AND PROJECTED LONG-TERM INVESTMENT RETURNS.

THE IMPACT OF WORLD TRADE POLICIES

IN 1992, THE UNITED STATES AND THE EUROPEAN UNION ENTERED INTO A BILATERAL

AGREEMENT DISCIPLINING GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES TO AIRBUS INDUSTRIE.  AMONG OTHER

THINGS, THE AGREEMENT LIMITED THE AMOUNT OF THE SUBSIDY TO NO MORE THAN 33% OF

THE TOTAL DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR EACH AIRPLANE PROGRAM. IT ALSO CALLS FOR A

"PROGRESSIVE REDUCTION" IN THAT LEVEL OF SUPPORT. HOWEVER, IN 1994, MORE THAN

130 COUNTRIES, INCLUDING ALL THE STATES OF THE EUROPEAN UNION, SIGNED THE

SUBSIDIES AND COUNTERVAILING MEASURES ("SCM") AGREEMENT AT THE WORLD TRADE

ORGANIZATION IN GENEVA. THE 1994 SCM AGREEMENT PROHIBITS GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES

TO VIRTUALLY ALL INDUSTRIES, INCLUDING THE AEROSPACE INDUSTRY. THE COMPANY

WELCOMES THE RESTRUCTURING OF AIRBUS INTO A "SINGLE CORPORATE ENTITY" AS LONG

AS IT COMPLIES WITH THE 1994 SCM AND RESULTS IN MORE TRANSPARENT FINANCIAL

REPORTING.

THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO), BASED IN GENEVA, PROMOTES OPEN AND NON-

DISCRIMINATORY TRADE AMONG ITS MEMBERS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, IT ADMINISTERS AN

IMPROVED SCM AGREEMENT, APPLICABLE TO ALL MEMBERS, THAT PROVIDES IMPORTANT

PROTECTIONS AGAINST INJURIOUS SUBSIDIES BY GOVERNMENTS. IT ALSO USES IMPROVED

DISPUTE SETTLEMENT PROCEDURES TO RESOLVE DISAGREEMENTS AMONG NATIONS - A

PROVISION NOT FOUND IN THE 1992 BILATERAL AGREEMENT. THE 1992 BILATERAL UNITED

STATES-EUROPEAN UNION AGREEMENT AND THE WTO SUBSIDIES CODE CONSTITUTE THE BASIC

LIMITS ON GOVERNMENT SUPPORTS OF DEVELOPMENT COSTS.

SEE THE DISCUSSION ON PAGE 37 CONCERNING THE EUROPEAN UNION CHALLENGE THAT

HAS BEEN FILED WITH THE WTO RELATED TO U.S. FOREIGN SALES CORPORATION TAX

PROVISIONS.

GOVERNMENTS AND COMPANIES IN ASIA AND THE FORMER SOVIET UNION ARE SEEKING TO

DEVELOP OR EXPAND AIRPLANE DESIGN AND MANUFACTURING CAPABILITIES THROUGH

TEAMING ARRANGEMENTS WITH EACH OTHER OR CURRENT MANUFACTURERS. THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO EXPLORE WAYS TO EXPAND ITS GLOBAL PRESENCE IN THIS ENVIRONMENT.

SUMMARY

ALTHOUGH NEAR-TERM MARKET UNCERTAINTIES REMAIN, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO

THE ECONOMIC SITUATION IN CERTAIN ASIAN COUNTRIES AND OPEN MARKET ACCESS, THE

LONG-TERM MARKET OUTLOOK APPEARS FAVORABLE. THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED IN

47

48

ALL SEGMENTS OF THE COMMERCIAL JET AIRPLANE MARKET, AND INTENDS TO REMAIN THE

AIRLINE INDUSTRY'S PREFERRED SUPPLIER THROUGH EMPHASIS ON PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND

CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT PROVIDE THE BEST OVERALL VALUE IN THE INDUSTRY.

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

--------------------------------------------------------------

BOEING IS THE WORLD'S LARGEST PRODUCER OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT, AND THE SECOND

LARGEST U.S. DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE (DOD) SUPPLIER. THE COMPANY'S PROGRAMS ARE

WELL BALANCED BETWEEN CURRENT PRODUCTION AND UPGRADE ACTIVITIES, POST-

PRODUCTION AEROSPACE SUPPORT ACTIVITIES, AND MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS WITH

LARGE POTENTIAL PRODUCTION QUANTITIES.

GENERAL ENVIRONMENT

THE DOD REMAINS THE PRINCIPAL CUSTOMER OF THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES

SEGMENT.  MAJOR TRENDS THAT SHAPE THIS BUSINESS SEGMENT INCLUDE THE SMALLER AND

AGING FORCE STRUCTURE, THE LEVEL OF MILITARY ENGAGEMENT AROUND THE WORLD, THE

INCREASING INTERNATIONAL DEMAND FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES, AND

CONSOLIDATIONS WITHIN THE INDUSTRY.  CONTINUING DEMANDS FOR PEACEKEEPING

OPERATIONS ARE DRIVING HIGH USAGE OF EQUIPMENT AND THE AGING OF EQUIPMENT IS

CREATING OPERATING COST AFFORDABILITY PRESSURES.

IN FISCAL YEAR 2001, THE DOD PROCUREMENT BUDGET REACHED THE $60 BILLION GOAL

ORIGINALLY SET BY THE 1997 QUADRENNIAL DEFENSE REVIEW (QDR).  HOWEVER, THE DOD,

THE CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET OFFICE, AND SEVERAL INDEPENDENT STUDIES NOW AGREE THAT

THE 1997 QDR SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERESTIMATED THE LEVEL OF FUNDING NECESSARY TO

MODERNIZE HEAVILY USED AND RAPIDLY AGING EQUIPMENT. CURRENT ACQUISITION RATES

FOR AIRCRAFT, MISSILES, SHIPS, ETC., ARE WELL BELOW THE STEADY-STATE RATES

NEEDED TO RECAPITALIZE AGING EQUIPMENT. THUS, MODERNIZATION WILL BE AN

IMPORTANT ISSUE WITH THE NEW ADMINISTRATION AND THE NEW CONGRESS AND MODERATE

INCREASES IN MILITARY RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AND IN PROCUREMENT FUNDING ARE

EXPECTED.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT DOD FIGHTER MODERNIZATION PROGRAM IS THE JOINT STRIKE

FIGHTER (JSF), WHERE BOEING IS IN COMPETITION FOR THE FOLLOW-ON PHASES OF THE

PROGRAM (ENGINEERING & MANUFACTURING DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION). JSF VARIANTS

ARE PLANNED TO REPLACE AGING AIRCRAFT IN SEVERAL UNITED STATES AND UNITED

KINGDOM MILITARY SERVICES. U.S. AIRCRAFT BEING REPLACED INCLUDE THE F-16, A-10,

A-6, AND THE AV-8B HARRIER, WHILE THE UNITED KINGDOM INTENDS TO REPLACE THE SEA

HARRIER AND GR7. ADDITIONALLY, OTHER U.S. ALLIES HAVE VOICED INTEREST IN THE

JSF PROGRAM, AND THE COMPANY BELIEVES THERE WILL BE A SUBSTANTIAL INTERNATIONAL

MARKET FOR THE LOW-COST, HIGH-PERFORMANCE STRIKE AIRCRAFT. THE CURRENT DOD

STRATEGY FOR THE JSF, WHICH HAS A PROJECTED CONTRACT VALUE FOR ENGINEERING AND

MANUFACTURING DEVELOPMENT OF UP TO $20 BILLION, IS TO HAVE ONE PRIME

CONTRACTOR, WITH THE SELECTION SCHEDULED TO OCCUR IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2001. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE DOD PROCUREMENT POLICY REGARDING JSF WILL

CONTINUE TO EVOLVE.

THE MILITARY'S SEARCH FOR MORE ECONOMICAL MAINTENANCE OF AGING EQUIPMENT HAS

ALSO LED TO PRIVATIZATION OF SOME GOVERNMENT ACTIVITIES AND HAS OPENED AREAS OF

GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY IN AEROSPACE SUPPORT. THE C-17 LOGISTICS SUPPORT

CONTRACT IS AN EXAMPLE OF THIS TREND.

48

49

THE COMPANY FACES STRONG COMPETITION IN ALL MARKET SEGMENTS. AS THE RESULT

OF INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION IN THE UNITED STATES, DOD NOW RELIES ON THREE

PRINCIPAL PRIME CONTRACTORS TO SUPPLY MILITARY HARDWARE: BOEING, LOCKHEED

MARTIN AND RAYTHEON.  GIVEN THE SMALL NUMBER OF PRIMES, THE COMPANY AND ITS

COMPETITORS OFTEN PARTNER AND SERVE AS MAJOR SUPPLIERS TO EACH OTHER ON A

VARIOUS NUMBER OF PROGRAMS. WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME FURTHER NICHE ACQUISITIONS

AND PRODUCT PORTFOLIO EXCHANGES AT THE PRIME CONTRACTOR LEVEL, THE MAJOR AREA

FOR FURTHER CONSOLIDATION IS LIKELY TO BE AMONG SUBCONTRACTORS TO THE PRIMES.

GENERAL ELECTRIC HAS EMERGED AS A DOMINANT SUBCONTRACTOR WITH ITS ACQUISITION

OF HONEYWELL.  IN ADDITION, UK-BASED BAE SYSTEMS HAS PURSUED ACQUISITIONS IN

THE UNITED STATES, INCLUDING THE RECENT PURCHASE OF LOCKHEED MARTIN'S

ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS (SANDERS) BUSINESS.  INTERNATIONALLY, BOEING FACES STRONG

COMPETITION PRIMARILY FROM EUROPE.  THE CONSOLIDATION AND RATIONALIZATION OF

THE EUROPEAN DEFENSE AND SPACE INDUSTRY DURING THE PAST DECADE HAS EVOLVED INTO

A DEFINED END-STATE WITH TWO DOMINANT COMPANIES: BAE SYSTEMS AND THE EUROPEAN

AERONAUTICS DEFENCE AND SPACE COMPANY (EADS). EADS IS NOW THE WORLD'S THIRD

LARGEST AIRCRAFT AND DEFENSE COMPANY BEHIND BOEING AND LOCKHEED MARTIN. EUROPE

IS ALSO CONSOLIDATING WITHIN MARKET SEGMENTS WITH THE CREATION OF MATRA BAE

DYNAMICS ALENIA (MBDA) AS THE PRIMARY EUROPEAN WEAPONS PROVIDER AND AGUSTA

WESTLAND AS A SINGLE EUROPEAN ROTORCRAFT ENTITY.  IN RESPONSE TO EMERGING

OPPORTUNITIES AND COMPETITIVE PRESSURES INTERNATIONALLY, BOEING IS ACTIVELY

PURSUING A GLOBALIZATION STRATEGY AIMED AT IMPROVING THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE

POSITION.  IN EUROPE, BOEING CONTINUES TO EXPLORE TRANSATLANTIC PARTNERSHIPS ON

SEVERAL PROGRAMS IN THE COMPANY'S MARKETS OF INTEREST.  IN ASIA, BOEING IS

SEEKING TO EXPAND ALLIANCES WITH INDIGENOUS MILITARY SUPPLIERS IN THE REGION.

PRODUCT LINES

THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES SEGMENT PRODUCES TACTICAL FIGHTERS,

TRAINERS, HELICOPTERS, MILITARY TRANSPORTS, TANKERS, STRIKE MISSILES, AND

SPECIAL PURPOSE AIRPLANES FOR THE U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. THIS SEGMENT

ALSO PROVIDES AEROSPACE SUPPORT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH INCLUDE

MAINTENANCE AND MODIFICATION, TRAINING SYSTEMS, SUPPORT SYSTEMS, SUPPORT

SERVICES, AND SPARES, REPAIRS AND SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT. SEVERAL PROGRAMS ARE

NOW IN PRODUCTION FOR THE DOD, SUCH AS THE C-17 TRANSPORT, F/A-18E/F, T-45

TRAINER AND V-22 TILTROTOR. FOREIGN SALES APPROVED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE

EXTENDING SOME PRODUCT LINES, SUCH AS THE HARPOON MISSILE, THE AH-64 AND CH-47

HELICOPTERS. OTHER PROGRAMS INCLUDE THOSE THAT ARE TRANSITIONING TO LOW-RATE

INITIAL PRODUCTION, SUCH AS THE F-22 RAPTOR, THOSE THAT ARE STILL IN

DEVELOPMENT, SUCH AS THE RAH-66 ROTORCRAFT, OR IN COMPETITIVE DEVELOPMENT, SUCH

AS THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER. THE JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THREE

VARIANTS, WHICH INCLUDES A CONVENTIONAL TAKEOFF AND LANDING (CTOL) AIRPLANE FOR

THE U.S. AIR FORCE TO REPLACE THE F-16 AND A-10, A CARRIER-BASED STRIKE FIGHTER

FOR THE U.S. NAVY TO REPLACE THE A-6, AND A SHORT TAKEOFF AND VERTICAL LANDING

(STOVL) FOR THE U.S. MARINE CORPS TO REPLACE THE AV-8B HARRIER.  THE STOVL

VARIANT IS ALSO PLANNED TO REPLACE THE U.K. ROYAL NAVY SEA HARRIER AND THE

ROYAL AIR FORCE GR7.

THE BASIC STRATEGY OF THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES SEGMENT IS TO

PROVIDE COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN EVERY SELECTED MARKET. OVER TIME,

SUCCESS IN IMPROVING THE COMPETITIVE POSITION AND MARKET SHARE DEPENDS ON THE

ABILITY TO PROVIDE INTEGRATED PRODUCT AND SERVICE SOLUTIONS THAT BEST MEET

CUSTOMER NEEDS. A REAL-WORLD IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS STRATEGY IS PROVIDED BY THE

JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER PROGRAM, WHERE THE COMPANY'S "TOTAL SYSTEM" APPROACH WILL

MODERNIZE THE SERVICE'S TACTICAL FORCES AT THE LOWEST COST, WITH LOW-RISK AND

DESIGNED-IN GROWTH CAPACITY, WHILE PROVIDING A SYSTEM THAT SURPASSES CURRENT

AIRCRAFT IN PERFORMANCE, MISSION EFFECTIVENESS AND SUPPORTABILITY.

49

50

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

--------------------------------------------------------

THERE ARE FOUR MAJOR ADDRESSABLE MARKETS FOR THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

SEGMENT: LAUNCH SERVICES, INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS, HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT

AND EXPLORATION, MISSILE DEFENSE AND SPACE CONTROL.

MANY ENVIRONMENTAL FACTORS AFFECT THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LAUNCH SERVICES

BUSINESS.  THE NEAR-TERM SOFTENING OF THE NON-GEOSTATIONARY SATELLITE LAUNCH

MARKET AND THE RESULTING FORECAST OF EXCESS CAPACITY IN LAUNCH VEHICLE SUPPLY

WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE A HIGHLY COMPETITIVE ATMOSPHERE WHERE CAPABILITY,

SERVICE AVAILABILITY, RELIABILITY, AND AFFORDABILITY WILL BE CRITICAL SUCCESS

FACTORS.  WITH THE DELTA FAMILY AND SEA LAUNCH COMMERCIAL LAUNCH VEHICLES THE

COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED TO RESPOND TO THESE CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS.  AS

THE LAUNCH MARKET CONTINUES TO EVOLVE, THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT IS

PREPARED TO PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN NASA-DRIVEN AND INDUSTRY-DRIVEN ADVANCED SPACE

TRANSPORTATION TECHNOLOGY DEVELOPMENTS.

THE INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATIONS MARKET TARGETS BOTH GOVERNMENT AND

COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS.  THIS MARKET OFFERS THE LARGEST OPPORTUNITY FOR GROWTH

FOR THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT.  THE GOVERNMENT SEGMENT INCLUDES

AIRBORNE MISSION SYSTEMS, SPACE SYSTEMS, SATELLITE SYSTEMS, AND INTEGRATED

SYSTEMS-OF-SYSTEMS OPPORTUNITIES.  THE COMMERCIAL SEGMENT INCLUDES SATELLITE

MANUFACTURING, HYBRID NETWORK SYSTEMS, AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS OPPORTUNITIES.

PRODUCTS SERVING THESE MARKETS REQUIRE STRONG CUSTOMER-FOCUSED SOLUTIONS AND

SEAMLESS INTERFACES WITH MULTIPLE SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS.  THE SPACE AND

COMMUNICATION SEGMENTS EXPERIENCE IN LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION PROJECTS,

ALONG WITH RELATED EXPERTISE IN SATELLITE SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT AND MANUFACTURING

AND ON PROGRAMS SUCH AS AIRBORNE WARNING AND CONTROL SYSTEM, WILL PROVIDE THE

LEVERAGE NECESSARY TO EXPAND IN THIS MARKET.

THE HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT AND EXPLORATION MARKET IS FORECAST TO BE RELATIVELY

FLAT OVER THE NEXT TEN YEARS.  THIS FORECAST IS BASED ON BUDGET PROJECTIONS FOR

NASA, THE PRIMARY CUSTOMER FOR THIS MARKET.  THE NEAR-TERM FOCUS WILL BE ON THE

SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION AND ASSEMBLY OF THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION (ISS),

FOR WHICH BOEING IS THE PRIME CONTRACTOR.  NASA IS EXPECTED TO AWARD CONTRACTS

FOR THE CREW RETURN VEHICLE AND THE OPERATIONS AND UTILIZATION OF ISS.  THE

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT IS WELL POSITIONED TO PURSUE THESE CONTRACTS.

ADDITIONALLY, THE SPACE SHUTTLE CONTINUES TO REMAIN THE ONLY U.S. VEHICLE TO

SUPPORT HUMAN SPACE ACCESS, AND BOEING PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN SHUTTLE OPERATIONS

AND MAINTENANCE THROUGH UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE, THE COMPANY'S JOINT VENTURE

ARRANGEMENT WITH LOCKHEED MARTIN.  THE ONE-HUNDREDTH SPACE SHUTTLE MISSION WAS

FLOWN IN 2000.  NASA IS EXPECTED TO PURSUE FUTURE FUNDING FOR LONG-TERM SPACE

EXPLORATION ONCE THE ISS HAS BEEN ASSEMBLED.

FUNDING FOR THE MISSILE DEFENSE AND SPACE CONTROL MARKET IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN

BY U.S. GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT AND PROCUREMENT BUDGETS.  MARKET COMPONENTS

INCLUDE NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE, THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE (WEAPONS AND SYSTEMS

OF SYSTEMS SOLUTIONS) ALONG WITH SPACE CONTROL.  THE PRIME CONTRACTOR ROLE ON

THE NATIONAL MISSILE DEFENSE PROGRAM WILL DEMONSTRATE THE COMPANY'S ABILITY TO

PROVIDE A SYSTEM OF SYSTEMS SOLUTION FOR NATIONAL DEFENSE.  ACCOMPLISHMENTS ON

THE PAC-3 (PATRIOT ADVANCED CAPABILITY MISSILE) PROGRAM, AND THE THEATER HIGH

ALTITUDE AREA DEFENSE PROGRAM HAS ESTABLISHED THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

SEGMENT AS A MAJOR PLAYER IN THE MISSILE DEFENSE MARKET.  WE HAVE ALSO

ESTABLISHED A STRONG TECHNICAL POSITION IN THE EMERGING LASER SYSTEM

APPLICATIONS MARKET.  BOEING IS WELL POSITIONED TO LEAD IN THE MISSILE DEFENSE

MARKETPLACE.

50

51

STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS FOR LONG-TERM VALUE

-----------------------------------------

NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE CURRENT AIRCRAFT

MODELS, AND ASSESSES THE MARKETPLACE TO ENSURE THAT ITS FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL

JET AIRCRAFT IS WELL POSITIONED TO MEET FUTURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AIRLINE

INDUSTRY. THE FUNDAMENTAL STRATEGY IS TO MAINTAIN A BROAD PRODUCT LINE THAT IS

RESPONSIVE TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS BY MAXIMIZING COMMONALITY AMONG THE

BOEING FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS DETERMINED

TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BY OFFERING PRODUCTS

WITH THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF QUALITY, SAFETY, TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE, ECONOMIC

PERFORMANCE AND IN-SERVICE SUPPORT.

THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DELTA IV

EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE. THE SEA LAUNCH JOINT VENTURE OFFERS AUTOMATED

COMMERCIAL SATELLITE LAUNCHES FROM A SEAGOING LAUNCH PLATFORM.  THESE PRODUCTS

GIVE THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT GREATER ACCESS TO A PORTION OF THE

LAUNCH MARKET THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY UNAVAILABLE WITH THE DELTA II ROCKET ALONE.

THE COMPANY ALSO CONTINUES TO INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE AIRBORNE EARLY

WARNING & CONTROL SYSTEMS PLATFORM.  THESE INVESTMENTS WILL ALSO PROVIDE

LEVERAGE IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF OTHER INFORMATION, COMMUNICATION AND BATTLE

MANAGEMENT APPLICATIONS.

MAJOR PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS

THE COMPANY REMAINS STRONGLY COMMITTED TO BECOMING A WORLD-CLASS LEADER IN ALL

ASPECTS OF ITS BUSINESS AND TO MAINTAINING A STRONG FOCUS ON CUSTOMER NEEDS,

INCLUDING PRODUCT CAPABILITIES, TECHNOLOGY, IN-SERVICE ECONOMICS AND PRODUCT

SUPPORT. MAJOR LONG-TERM PRODUCTIVITY GAINS ARE BEING AGGRESSIVELY PURSUED,

WITH RESOURCES INVESTED IN EDUCATION AND TRAINING, RESTRUCTURING OF PROCESSES,

NEW TECHNOLOGY, AND ORGANIZATIONAL REALIGNMENT.  RECENT COMMERCIAL AND

GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE 767-400ER, 737-900 AND JOINT

STRIKE FIGHTER, INCLUDED EARLY COMMITMENT OF RESOURCES FOR INTEGRATED PRODUCT

TEAMS, DESIGN INTERFACE WITH CUSTOMER REPRESENTATIVES, USE OF ADVANCED THREE-

DIMENSIONAL DIGITAL PRODUCT DEFINITION AND DIGITAL PRE-ASSEMBLY COMPUTER

APPLICATIONS, AND INCREASED USE OF AUTOMATED MANUFACTURING PROCESSES. ALTHOUGH

THESE MEASURES HAVE REQUIRED SIGNIFICANT CURRENT INVESTMENTS, SUBSTANTIAL LONG-

TERM BENEFITS ARE ANTICIPATED FROM REDUCTIONS IN DESIGN CHANGES AND REWORK AND

IMPROVED QUALITY OF INTERNALLY MANUFACTURED AND SUPPLIER PARTS. SIGNIFICANT

INITIATIVES TO IMPROVE PRODUCTION SYSTEMS AND PROCESSES ARE UNDERWAY. EFFORTS

TO STREAMLINE CONFIGURATION, ORDERING AND SHOP FLOOR SYSTEMS CONTINUE. MANY OF

THE LEAN MANUFACTURING CONCEPTS ARE BEING IMPLEMENTED ACROSS THE ENTERPRISE.

EFFORTS ARE UNDERWAY ON PART NUMBER REDUCTION, REDUCING CYCLE TIME AND

MAXIMIZING THE VALUE OF AIRPLANE CHANGE. THE INITIATIVES WILL ENHANCE THE

COMPANY'S ABILITY TO INSURE STANDARDIZATION WHERE IT BENEFITS CUSTOMERS,

PROVIDE "JUST IN TIME" FEATURE SELECTION, AND ALLOW FOR MORE PREDICTABLE,

STABLE AND SHORTER PRODUCTION FLOWS. THESE INITIATIVES WILL IMPROVE OPERATIONAL

EFFICIENCIES AND PROVIDE BETTER CUSTOMER PRODUCT SELECTION.

THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES SEGMENT AND THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

SEGMENT CONTINUE TO AGGRESSIVELY PURSUE IMPORTANT PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS THROUGH

INTEGRATED PRODUCT TEAMS THAT PROVIDE COST-EFFECTIVE SOLUTIONS AND MAINTAIN

TECHNOLOGICAL SUPERIORITY. PHANTOM WORKS, THE ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ORGANIZATION OF BOEING, FOCUSES ON IMPROVING THE COMPANY'S COMPETITIVE POSITION

THROUGH INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, IMPROVED PROCESSES AND THE CREATION OF NEW

51

52

PRODUCTS.  THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO ASSESS POTENTIAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR

IMPROVED USE AND CONSOLIDATION OF FACILITIES ACROSS ALL PARTS OF THE COMPANY

AND TO FOCUS ON THOSE CAPABILITIES AND PROCESSES THAT CONTRIBUTE TO CORE

COMPETENCIES RESULTING IN A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE. FUTURE DECISIONS REGARDING

FACILITIES CONVERSIONS OR CONSOLIDATIONS WILL BE BASED ON LONG-TERM BUSINESS

OBJECTIVES.  WITHIN THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES AND SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENTS, MAJOR RESTRUCTURING ACTIONS WILL BE CONTINGENT ON

DEMONSTRATION OF COST SAVINGS FOR U.S. GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS AND THE COMPANY.

THE COMPANY IS PURSUING THE MEANS TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE NEW PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT COST AND FLOW TIME. INITIATIVES THAT HAVE COME OUT OF THIS EFFORT

INCLUDE THE FORMATION OF THE CREATION CENTER, WHICH IS TIED CLOSELY WITH

PHANTOM WORKS, AND OTHER COMPARABLE EFFORTS. ANOTHER INITIATIVE IS THE

MIGRATION TO PLATFORMS AND PLATFORM TEAMS MODELED AFTER PREMIER BENCHMARKED

COMPANIES. OTHER INITIATIVES INCLUDE DESIGN TOOL AUTOMATION INTEGRATED WITH

MANUFACTURING, IMPROVED LOADS MODELS, AND DECISION SUPPORT METHODOLOGIES.

THE COMPANY IS USING ENTERPRISE PROCESS COUNCILS AS THE STRUCTURE FOR REALIZING

SYNERGIES COMPANYWIDE. THESE COUNCILS ARE MADE UP OF THE LEADERS OF KEY

PROCESSES FROM EACH OF THE OPERATING GROUPS, AS WELL AS PHANTOM WORKS, AND WILL

RAPIDLY SHARE BEST PRACTICES AND COMBINE EFFORTS TO MEET NEEDS ACROSS THE

COMPANY. ENTERPRISE PROCESS COUNCILS HAVE BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR ENGINEERING,

PRODUCTION OPERATIONS, FINANCE, QUALITY AND PROCUREMENT PROCESSES.

SHAREHOLDER VALUE AS CORPORATE PERFORMANCE MEASURE

--------------------------------------------------

MANAGEMENT PERFORMANCE MEASURES ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A GOOD BALANCE BETWEEN

SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM MEASURES AND FINANCIAL AND NON-FINANCIAL MEASURES TO

ALIGN ALL DECISION PROCESSES AND OPERATING OBJECTIVES TO INCREASE SHAREHOLDER

VALUE OVER THE LONG TERM.

IN 1999, THE COMPANY INITIATED A MANAGING FOR VALUE PROGRAM DESIGNED TO

DEVELOP A COMPANYWIDE CULTURE TO CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE AND

GROWTH. CONSISTENT WITH THESE OBJECTIVES, THE COMPANY HAS SET PERFORMANCE

TARGETS BASED ON ECONOMIC PROFIT GOALS. ECONOMIC PROFIT, WHICH IS CALCULATED BY

SUBTRACTING A CAPITAL CHARGE FROM THE COMPANY'S NET OPERATING PROFIT AFTER

TAXES, IS THE METRIC USED TO MEASURE OVERALL FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. AWARDS TO

EXECUTIVES UNDER THE COMPANY'S INCENTIVE COMPENSATION PLAN ARE BASED ON THE

ACHIEVEMENT OF ECONOMIC PROFIT TARGETS. EFFECTIVE FOR 2000, WITH FIRST PAYOUT

IN 2001, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED AN INCENTIVE PLAN THAT WILL PROVIDE ANNUAL CASH

REWARDS TO NON-UNION, NON-EXECUTIVE EMPLOYEES UPON ACHIEVING ANNUAL FINANCIAL

PERFORMANCE OBJECTIVES BASED ON ECONOMIC PROFIT.

IN 1998, THE COMPANY IMPLEMENTED A STOCK-AWARD PLAN FOR EXECUTIVE

COMPENSATION IN PLACE OF STOCK OPTIONS. UNDER THIS PLAN, RIGHTS TO RECEIVE

STOCK, REFERRED TO AS PERFORMANCE SHARES, HAVE BEEN ISSUED TO PLAN

PARTICIPANTS. AN INCREASING PORTION OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED WILL BE

CONVERTIBLE TO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AS THE STOCK PRICE REACHES AND MAINTAINS

CERTAIN THRESHOLD LEVELS. THESE THRESHOLD STOCK PRICE LEVELS REPRESENT

PREDETERMINED COMPOUND FIVE-YEAR GROWTH RATES RELATIVE TO THE STOCK PRICE AT

THE TIME THE PERFORMANCE SHARES ARE GRANTED.  DURING 2000, PORTIONS OF THE

PERFORMANCE SHARES GRANTED IN 1999 AND 2000 WERE CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK.

ANY PERFORMANCE SHARES NOT CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK AFTER FIVE YEARS FROM DATE

OF GRANT WILL EXPIRE. THIS PLAN IS INTENDED TO INCREASE EXECUTIVE MANAGEMENT'S

FOCUS ON IMPROVING SHAREHOLDER VALUE.

52

53

SEGMENT INFORMATION

NOTE 24 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

THE COMPANY IS ORGANIZED BASED ON THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IT OFFERS. UNDER

THIS ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE, THE COMPANY OPERATES IN THE FOLLOWING PRINCIPAL

AREAS: COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES, MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES, SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS, AND CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

OPERATIONS PRINCIPALLY INVOLVE DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT AND PROVIDING RELATED SUPPORT SERVICES, PRINCIPALLY TO

THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE. MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES

OPERATIONS PRINCIPALLY INVOLVE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, MODIFICATION

AND SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS AND RELATED SYSTEMS: MILITARY AIRCRAFT,

BOTH LAND-BASED AND AIRCRAFT-CARRIER-BASED, INCLUDING FIGHTER, TRANSPORT AND

ATTACK AIRCRAFT WITH WIDE MISSION CAPABILITY, AND VERTICAL/SHORT TAKEOFF AND

LANDING CAPABILITY; HELICOPTERS AND MISSILES. SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

OPERATIONS PRINCIPALLY INVOLVE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION, MODIFICATION

AND SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS AND RELATED SYSTEMS: SPACE SYSTEMS,

MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS, SATELLITES AND SATELLITE LAUNCHING VEHICLES, ROCKET

ENGINES, AND INFORMATION AND BATTLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS. ALTHOUGH SOME MILITARY

AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES AND SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS ARE CONTRACTED IN

THE COMMERCIAL ENVIRONMENT, THE PRIMARY CUSTOMER IS THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE

CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING/OTHER SEGMENT IS PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE

FINANCING OF COMMERCIAL AND PRIVATE AIRCRAFT, COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT, AND REAL

ESTATE. IN OCTOBER 2000, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED THE CREATION OF TWO NEW BUSINESS

UNITS: CONNEXION BY BOEINGSM AND AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT. THESE BUSINESS UNITS

ARE INCLUDED IN THE SEGMENT INFORMATION FOR SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS AND

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES.

THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT IS SUBJECT TO BOTH OPERATIONAL AND EXTERNAL

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT RISKS. OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT CAN SERIOUSLY DISRUPT THE

COMPANY'S ABILITY TO MAKE TIMELY DELIVERY OF ITS COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT AND

MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS INCLUDE EXECUTION OF INTERNAL PERFORMANCE

PLANS, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY CERTIFICATIONS OF

THE COMPANY'S COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN

GOVERNMENTS, OTHER REGULATORY UNCERTAINTIES, COLLECTIVE BARGAINING LABOR

DISPUTES, PERFORMANCE ISSUES WITH KEY SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS AND THE COST

AND AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY RESOURCES, SUCH AS ELECTRICAL POWER.  AIRCRAFT

PROGRAMS, PARTICULARLY NEW AIRCRAFT MODELS SUCH AS THE 717 PROGRAM, FACE THE

ADDITIONAL RISK OF PRICING PRESSURES AND COST MANAGEMENT ISSUES INHERENT IN THE

DESIGN AND PRODUCTION OF COMPLEX PRODUCTS. FINANCING SUPPORT MAY BE PROVIDED BY

THE COMPANY TO AIRLINES, SOME OF WHICH ARE UNABLE TO OBTAIN OTHER FINANCING.

WHILE THE COMPANY'S PRINCIPAL OPERATIONS ARE IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND

AUSTRALIA, SOME KEY SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS ARE LOCATED IN EUROPE AND

JAPAN. EXTERNAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT RISKS INCLUDE ADVERSE GOVERNMENTAL EXPORT

AND IMPORT POLICIES, FACTORS THAT RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT AND PROLONGED

DISRUPTION TO AIR TRAVEL WORLDWIDE, AND OTHER FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE ECONOMIC

VIABILITY OF THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY. EXAMPLES OF FACTORS RELATING TO

THE INFORMATION IN THE FOLLOWING TABLES IS DERIVED DIRECTLY FROM THE

SEGMENTS' INTERNAL FINANCIAL REPORTING USED FOR CORPORATE MANAGEMENT PURPOSES.

THE EXPENSES, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO CORPORATE ACTIVITY ARE NOT

ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS. LESS THAN 2% OF OPERATING ASSETS ARE

LOCATED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES.

ATTRIBUTABLE TO PARTICIPATION IN DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A

REDUCTION IN THE COST OF INVENTORY RECEIVED FROM THE SUPPLIER UNDER THE PROGRAM

ACCOUNTING METHOD, AND AS AN EXPENSE REDUCTION IN THE PERIOD THE PROCEEDS ARE

RECEIVED FOR INTERNAL MEASUREMENT PURPOSES. THESE ADJUSTMENTS BETWEEN THE

INTERNAL MEASUREMENT METHOD AND THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING METHOD ARE INCLUDED IN

HAVE CONTROL, BUT HAS THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY METHOD.

ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY'S SHARE OF NET EARNINGS AND LOSSES FROM THESE VENTURES

IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS. INTERCOMPANY PROFITS,

TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN CONSOLIDATION.  CERTAIN

RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO PRIOR PERIODS TO CONFORM WITH CURRENT

REPORTING.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND ESTIMATES

THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES FOR WHICH CHANGES IN THE NEAR TERM ARE

CONSIDERED REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THESE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

SALES AND OTHER OPERATING REVENUES

SALES UNDER FIXED-PRICE-TYPE CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS DELIVERIES

ARE MADE OR AT THE COMPLETION OF SCHEDULED PERFORMANCE MILESTONES. FOR CERTAIN

FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE OVER AN EXTENDED

PERIOD BEFORE DELIVERIES BEGIN, SALES ARE RECORDED BASED UPON ATTAINMENT OF

SCHEDULED PERFORMANCE MILESTONES. SALES UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT CONTRACTS ARE

RECORDED AS COSTS ARE INCURRED. CERTAIN CONTRACTS CONTAIN PROFIT INCENTIVES

BASED UPON PERFORMANCE RELATIVE TO PREDETERMINED TARGETS THAT MAY OCCUR DURING

OR SUBSEQUENT TO DELIVERY OF THE PRODUCT. INCENTIVES, WHICH AMOUNTS CAN BE

REASONABLY ESTIMATED, ARE RECORDED OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD OF THE CONTRACT.

INCENTIVES AND FEE AWARDS, WHICH AMOUNTS CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED, ARE

RECORDED WHEN AWARDED.  COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT SALES ARE RECORDED AS DELIVERIES

ARE MADE UNLESS TRANSFER OF RISK AND REWARDS OF OWNERSHIP IS NOT SUFFICIENT.

CONTRACT AND PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

IN THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES SEGMENT AND SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

SEGMENT, OPERATIONS PRINCIPALLY CONSIST OF PERFORMING WORK UNDER CONTRACT,

PREDOMINANTLY FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS. COST OF SALES

FOR SUCH CONTRACTS IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE ESTIMATED AVERAGE TOTAL CONTRACT

COST AND REVENUE.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS ARE PLANNED, COMMITTED AND FACILITIZED BASED ON

LONG-TERM DELIVERY FORECASTS, NORMALLY FOR QUANTITIES IN EXCESS OF

CONTRACTUALLY FIRM ORDERS. COST OF SALES FOR THE 717, 737, 747, 757, 767 AND

777 COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS IS DETERMINED UNDER THE PROGRAM METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING BASED ON ESTIMATED AVERAGE TOTAL COST AND REVENUE FOR THE CURRENT

PROGRAM QUANTITY. THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING EFFECTIVELY AMORTIZES OR

AVERAGES TOOLING AND SPECIAL EQUIPMENT COSTS, AS WELL AS UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS,

OVER THE PROGRAM QUANTITY. BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS

EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW PROGRAM AND THE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT

REQUIRED FOR INITIAL TOOLING AND SPECIAL EQUIPMENT, NEW COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT

PROGRAMS NORMALLY HAVE LOWER OPERATING PROFIT MARGINS THAN ESTABLISHED

PROGRAMS. THE INITIAL PROGRAM QUANTITY FOR THE 717 PROGRAM HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED

AT 200 UNITS. THE ESTIMATED PROGRAM AVERAGE COSTS AND REVENUES ARE REVIEWED AND

REASSESSED QUARTERLY, AND CHANGES IN ESTIMATES ARE RECOGNIZED OVER CURRENT AND

FUTURE DELIVERIES CONSTITUTING THE PROGRAM QUANTITY. COST OF SALES FOR THE MD-

80, MD-90 AND MD-11 AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS IS DETERMINED ON A SPECIFIC-UNIT COST

METHOD.

TO THE EXTENT THAT INVENTORIABLE COSTS ARE EXPECTED TO EXCEED THE TOTAL

ESTIMATED SALES PRICE, CHARGES ARE MADE TO CURRENT EARNINGS TO REDUCE

INVENTORIED COSTS TO ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIED COSTS ON COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTS

INCLUDE DIRECT ENGINEERING, PRODUCTION AND TOOLING COSTS, AND APPLICABLE

OVERHEAD, NOT IN EXCESS OF ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH

INDUSTRY PRACTICE, INVENTORIED COSTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS RELATING TO PROGRAMS AND

CONTRACTS WITH LONG PRODUCTION CYCLES, A PORTION OF WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE

REALIZED WITHIN ONE YEAR. COMMERCIAL SPARE PARTS AND GENERAL STOCK MATERIALS

ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST NOT IN EXCESS OF NET REALIZABLE VALUE.

SHARE-BASED PLANS

THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE EXPENSE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF STATEMENT OF

FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS NO. 123, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION. THE COMPANY VALUES STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED BASED UPON AN OPTION-

PRICING MODEL AND RECOGNIZES THIS VALUE AS AN EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH

THE OPTIONS VEST. POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION FROM THE SHAREVALUE TRUST DESCRIBED IN

NOTE 18 HAVE BEEN VALUED BASED UPON AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL, WITH THE RELATED

EXPENSE RECOGNIZED OVER THE LIFE OF THE TRUST. SHARE-BASED EXPENSE ASSOCIATED

WITH PERFORMANCE SHARES DESCRIBED IN NOTE 18 IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE MARKET

VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK AT THE TIME OF THE AWARD APPLIED TO THE MAXIMUM

NUMBER OF SHARES CONTINGENTLY ISSUABLE BASED ON STOCK PRICE AND IS AMORTIZED

OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.

INCOME TAXES

FEDERAL, STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES ARE COMPUTED AT CURRENT TAX RATES, LESS

TAX CREDITS. TAXES ARE ADJUSTED BOTH FOR ITEMS THAT DO NOT HAVE TAX

CONSEQUENCES AND FOR THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ANY CHANGES IN TAX RATES FROM

THOSE PREVIOUSLY USED TO DETERMINE DEFERRED TAX ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. TAX

PROVISIONS INCLUDE AMOUNTS THAT ARE CURRENTLY PAYABLE, PLUS CHANGES IN DEFERRED

TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES THAT ARISE BECAUSE OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

THE TIME WHEN ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE RECOGNIZED FOR FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND INCOME TAX PURPOSES.

POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS

THE COMPANY'S FUNDING POLICY FOR PENSION PLANS IS TO CONTRIBUTE, AT A MINIMUM,

THE STATUTORILY REQUIRED AMOUNT TO AN IRREVOCABLE TRUST. BENEFITS UNDER THE

PLANS ARE GENERALLY BASED ON AGE AT RETIREMENT, THE EMPLOYEE'S ANNUAL EARNINGS

INDEXED AT THE U.S. TREASURY 30-YEAR BOND RATE, AND YEARS OF SERVICE. THE

ACTUARIAL COST METHOD USED IN DETERMINING THE NET PERIODIC PENSION COST IS THE

PROJECTED UNIT CREDIT METHOD.

OF DEPRECIATION ARE AS FOLLOWS: BUILDINGS AND LAND IMPROVEMENTS, 150% DECLINING

BALANCE; AND MACHINERY AND EQUIPMENT, SUM-OF-THE-YEARS' DIGITS. THE COMPANY

PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE APPROPRIATENESS OF REMAINING DEPRECIABLE LIVES

ASSIGNED TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS SUBJECT TO A MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR DISPOSITION.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS DEEMED AVAILABLE FOR SALE ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST

OR FAIR VALUE. LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR USE ARE SUBJECT TO AN IMPAIRMENT

ADJUSTMENT DOWN TO FAIR VALUE IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS NO LONGER RECOVERABLE

BASED UPON THE SUM OF UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS.

GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

GOODWILL, REPRESENTING THE EXCESS OF ACQUISITION COSTS OVER THE FAIR VALUE OF

NET ASSETS OF BUSINESSES PURCHASED, IS BEING AMORTIZED BY THE STRAIGHT-LINE

METHOD OVER 20 TO 30 YEARS. RECOVERABILITY OF THE UNAMORTIZED GOODWILL AND

ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES BALANCE IS PRIMARILY BASED UPON ASSESSMENT OF RELATED

OPERATIONAL CASH FLOWS.

ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES AND THEIR ASSOCIATED LIVES, AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-

LINE METHOD, INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGIES, 5 TO 20 YEARS;

TRADENAME, 20 YEARS; DATA REPOSITORIES, 15 TO 20 YEARS; ASSEMBLED WORKFORCE, 5

NOTE 4

MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

------------------------

ACCOUNTING FOR ACQUISITIONS

THE COMPANY'S ACQUISITIONS IN 2000 WERE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE PURCHASE

METHOD. THE PURCHASE PRICE OF EACH ACQUISITION WAS ALLOCATED TO THE NET ASSETS

ACQUIRED BASED ON ESTIMATES OF THEIR FAIR VALUES AT THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION

AND WAS BASED ON PRELIMINARY ESTIMATES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO FUTURE ADJUSTMENTS.

THE EXCESS OF THE PURCHASE PRICE OVER THE FAIR VALUES OF THE NET TANGIBLE

ASSETS, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ACQUIRED WAS ALLOCATED

TO GOODWILL, AND IS BEING AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER 20 YEARS. AS

DISCUSSED BELOW, A PORTION OF THE PURCHASE PRICE FOR CERTAIN ACQUISITIONS WAS

ALLOCATED TO IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D;) WHICH WAS IMMEDIATELY

EXPENSED. RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR THE NEWLY ACQUIRED ENTITIES HAVE BEEN

COMBINED WITH THOSE OF THE COMPANY FROM THE DATE OF ACQUISITION.

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE FAIR VALUE AMOUNT OF $500 OF IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D;)

ATTRIBUTED TO THE HUGHES ACQUISITION DISCUSSED BELOW WAS DETERMINED BY AN

INDEPENDENT VALUATION USING THE INCOME APPROACH.

THIRTEEN PROJECTS WERE INCLUDED IN THE VALUATION, OF WHICH THE PRINCIPAL

PROJECTS WERE BASED ON THE FOLLOWING: TECHNOLOGIES ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH-

EFFICIENCY SOLAR CELLS AND SATELLITE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY ($189), PHASED ARRAY

AND DIGITAL PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND SERVICE

($89), AND XENON-ION SYSTEMS FOR SATELLITE ENGINE PROPULSION ($82). THE FAIR

VALUE OF IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLES WAS ALSO DETERMINED BY AN INDEPENDENT

VALUATION PRIMARILY USING THE INCOME APPROACH. THE FOLLOWING RISK-ADJUSTED

DISCOUNT RATES WERE USED TO DISCOUNT THE PROJECT CASH FLOWS: SOLAR CELLS AND

SATELLITE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY, 17%; PHASED ARRAY AND DIGITAL PROCESSING

TECHNOLOGY TO PROVIDE HIGH-SPEED BROADBAND SERVICE, 18%; XENON-ION SYSTEMS FOR

SATELLITE ENGINE PROPULSION, 18%; ALL OTHER PROJECTS, 18.2% WEIGHTED AVERAGE.

OPERATING MARGINS WERE ASSUMED TO BE SIMILAR TO HISTORICAL MARGINS OF SIMILAR

PRODUCTS. THE SIZE OF THE APPLICABLE MARKET WAS VERIFIED FOR REASONABLENESS

WITH OUTSIDE RESEARCH SOURCES. THE PROJECTS WERE IN VARIOUS STAGES OF

COMPLETION RANGING FROM APPROXIMATELY 31% TO 92% COMPLETE AS OF THE VALUATION

DATE, WITH SPECIFIC PERCENTAGES COMPLETE BY PROJECT AS FOLLOWS: SOLAR CELLS AND

SATELLITE BATTERY TECHNOLOGY, 49%; PHASED ARRAY AND DIGITAL PROCESSING

71

72

TECHNOLOGY, 87%; XENON-ION SYSTEMS FOR SATELLITE ENGINE PROPULSION, 82%. THE

STAGE OF COMPLETION FOR EACH PROJECT WAS ESTIMATED BY EVALUATING THE COST TO

COMPLETE, COMPLEXITY OF THE TECHNOLOGY AND TIME TO MARKET. THE PROJECTS ARE

ANTICIPATED TO BE COMPLETED BETWEEN 2001 AND 2003. THE ESTIMATED COST TO

COMPLETE THE PROJECTS IS $80.

THE DISCOUNT RATES ABOVE ARE HIGHER THAN THE COMPANY'S WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST

OF CAPITAL DUE TO THE INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES IN THE ESTIMATES DESCRIBED ABOVE,

INCLUDING THE UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDING THE SUCCESSFUL COMPLETION OF THE

PURCHASED IN-PROCESS TECHNOLOGY, THE USEFUL LIFE OF SUCH TECHNOLOGY, THE

PROFITABILITY LEVELS OF SUCH TECHNOLOGY AND THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE TIMING OF

THE RELATED PRODUCT INTRODUCTION AND THEN-EXISTING COMPETING PRODUCTS. IF THESE

PROJECTS ARE NOT SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOPED, THE FUTURE REVENUE AND PROFITABILITY

OF BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. ADDITIONALLY, THE VALUE

OF THE OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS ACQUIRED MAY BECOME IMPAIRED.

THE FAIR VALUE AMOUNT OF $45 OF IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT (IPR&D;)

ATTRIBUTED TO THE ACQUISITION OF JEPPESEN SANDERSON INC., WAS DETERMINED BY AN

INDEPENDENT VALUATION.  THE ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

TECHNOLOGY CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF THREE SOFTWARE PROJECTS THAT WILL WORK

TOGETHER TO STORE INFORMATION AND EXTRACT IT FOR USE IN VARIOUS PRODUCTS SOLD

BY JEPPESEN.  THE TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW THE MANUFACTURE OF END USER

AERONAUTICAL INFORMATION BOTH BACKWARDS AND FORWARDS IN TIME, AND WILL ALLOW

THE EXTRACTION OF THE INFORMATION ON A NEAR REAL-TIME BASIS.  FURTHERMORE, THE

TECHNOLOGY WILL ALLOW THE CREATION OF PACKAGES OF AERONAUTICAL INFORMATION

DERIVED FROM A SINGLE SOURCE OF DATABASE INFORMATION, WHICH CAN BE TAILORED TO

INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMERS OR CAN BE PACKAGED AS A NEW PRODUCT.  THESE DATABASE AND

EXTRACTION CAPABILITIES ARE REQUIRED IN DEVELOPING NEW AND ENHANCED CHARTING

AND MAPPING PRODUCTS FOR CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE.  THESE ACQUIRED IN-PROCESS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROJECTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE COMPLETE BY MID-2001;

HOWEVER, FULL RANGE AND PRODUCTION OF THE TECHNOLOGY IS ANTICIPATED IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2002. THE TECHNOLOGY, ONCE COMPLETED, CAN ONLY BE USED FOR ITS

SPECIFIC AND INTENDED PURPOSE AND AS SUCH NO ALTERNATIVE FUTURE USES EXIST.

THE VALUATION METHODOLOGY WAS DETERMINED USING THE INCOME APPROACH, AND A RISK-

ADJUSTED DISCOUNT RATE OF 15% WAS USED TO DISCOUNT THE PROJECT CASH FLOW.  AS

OF THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION, JEPPESEN HAD INCURRED APPROXIMATELY $14 IN

COSTS RELATED TO IPR&D; PROJECTS.  THE ESTIMATED COST TO COMPLETE THE PROJECTS

WAS $7.

THE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES ASSOCIATED WITH INVENTORY AND LONG-TERM CONTRACT

METHODS OF INCOME RECOGNITION ENCOMPASS RELATED COSTING DIFFERENCES, INCLUDING

TIMING AND DEPRECIATION DIFFERENCES.

VALUATION ALLOWANCES WERE NOT REQUIRED DUE TO THE NATURE OF AND

CIRCUMSTANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE TEMPORARY TAX DIFFERENCES.

INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN SETTLED WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) FOR

ALL YEARS THROUGH 1978, AND IRS EXAMINATIONS HAVE BEEN COMPLETED THROUGH 1991.

IN CONNECTION WITH THESE EXAMINATIONS, THE COMPANY DISAGREES WITH IRS PROPOSED

ADJUSTMENTS, AND THE YEARS 1979 THROUGH 1987 ARE IN LITIGATION. THE COMPANY HAS

ALSO FILED REFUND CLAIMS FOR ADDITIONAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDITS,

PRIMARILY IN RELATION TO ITS FIXED-PRICE GOVERNMENT DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS.

SUCCESSFUL RESOLUTIONS WILL RESULT IN INCREASED INCOME TO THE COMPANY.

IN DECEMBER 1996, THE BOEING COMPANY FILED SUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT

FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON FOR THE REFUND OF OVER $400 IN FEDERAL

INCOME TAXES AND RELATED INTEREST.  THE SUIT CHALLENGED THE IRS METHOD OF

ALLOCATING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DETERMINING TAX

79

INCENTIVE BENEFITS ON EXPORT SALES THROUGH THE COMPANY'S DOMESTIC INTERNATIONAL

SALES CORPORATION (DISC) AND ITS FOREIGN SALES CORPORATION (FSC) FOR THE YEARS

1979 THROUGH 1987.  IN SEPTEMBER 1998, THE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED THE COMPANY'S

MOTION FOR SUMMARY JUDGMENT. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE HAS APPEALED THIS

DECISION.  IF THE COMPANY WERE TO PREVAIL, THE REFUND WOULD INCLUDE INTEREST

COMPUTED TO THE PAYMENT DATE.  THE ISSUE COULD AFFECT TAX COMPUTATIONS FOR

SUBSEQUENT YEARS; HOWEVER, THE FINANCIAL IMPACT WOULD DEPEND ON THE FINAL

RESOLUTION OF AUDITS FOR THESE YEARS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES ADEQUATE PROVISION HAS BEEN MADE FOR ALL OPEN YEARS.

INCOME TAX PAYMENTS, NET OF TAX REFUNDS, WERE $405, $575 AND $85 IN 2000,

1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY HAS VARIOUS NONCONTRIBUTORY PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

EMPLOYEES. ALL MAJOR PENSION PLANS ARE FUNDED AND HAVE PLAN ASSETS THAT EXCEED

ACCUMULATED BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS.

83

84

CERTAIN OF THE PENSION PLANS PROVIDE THAT, IN THE EVENT THERE IS A CHANGE IN

CONTROL OF THE COMPANY WHICH IS NOT APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE

PLANS ARE TERMINATED WITHIN FIVE YEARS THEREAFTER, THE ASSETS IN THE PLANS

FIRST WILL BE USED TO PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS REQUIRED BY THE

EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT INCOME SECURITY ACT, AND THEN ANY SURPLUS WILL BE USED TO

FUND A TRUST TO CONTINUE PRESENT AND FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER THE POSTRETIREMENT

MEDICAL AND LIFE INSURANCE BENEFITS IN THE COMPANY'S GROUP INSURANCE PROGRAMS.

THE COMPANY HAS AN AGREEMENT WITH THE GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OF

THE COMPANY PENSION PLANS.  UNDER THE AGREEMENT, SHOULD THE COMPANY TERMINATE

ANY OF THE PLANS UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE PLAN'S ASSETS EXCEED THAT PLAN'S

OBLIGATIONS, THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE ENTITLED TO A FAIR ALLOCATION OF ANY OF THE

PLAN'S ASSETS BASED ON PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE REIMBURSED UNDER GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS.  ALSO, THE REVENUE RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1990 IMPOSES A 20%

NONDEDUCTIBLE EXCISE TAX ON THE GROSS ASSETS REVERTED IF THE COMPANY

ESTABLISHES A QUALIFIED REPLACEMENT PLAN OR AMENDS THE TERMINATING PLAN TO

PROVIDE FOR BENEFIT INCREASES; OTHERWISE, A 50% TAX IS APPLIED.  ANY NET AMOUNT

RETAINED BY THE COMPANY IS TREATED AS TAXABLE INCOME.

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 1999, TWO NEW PENSION PLANS WERE CREATED FOR THE

SALARIED, NON-REPRESENTED EMPLOYEES OF PRE-MERGER BOEING AND MCDONNELL DOUGLAS.

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ASSOCIATED WITH BENEFITS EARNED THROUGH 1998 WERE

TRANSFERRED TO THE NEW PLANS, WHICH WILL PROVIDE SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME BENEFIT

LEVELS AS THE PRIOR PLANS.  EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 1999, ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

ASSOCIATED WITH BENEFITS EARNED BY SUBSTANTIALLY ALL SALARIED, NON-REPRESENTED

EMPLOYEES COVERED UNDER THE BNA RETIREMENT PLAN WERE TRANSFERRED TO THE NEW

PENSION PLAN CREATED FOR THE PRE-MERGER BOEING EMPLOYEES.

EFFECTIVE OCTOBER 6, 2000, THE COMPANY ACQUIRED A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF

HUGHES' PENSION ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE ACQUIRED PENSION PLANS ASSETS

EXCEEDED LIABILITIES BY $626. THIS ACQUISITION COMPRISED A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION

OF THE YEAR 2000 "ACQUISITION/DISPOSITION, NET" ACTIVITY SHOWN PREVIOUSLY.

THE COMPANY HAS CERTAIN UNFUNDED AND PARTIALLY FUNDED PLANS WITH A PROJECTED

BENEFIT OBLIGATION OF $488 AND $432, PLAN ASSETS OF $17 AND $43, AND

UNRECOGNIZED PRIOR SERVICE COSTS AND ACTUARIAL LOSSES OF $125 AND $124 AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999. THE NET PROVISION FOR THESE PLANS WAS $56, $63 AND

$52 FOR 2000, 1999 AND 1998, RESPECTIVELY.

THE PRINCIPAL DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS ARE THE COMPANY-SPONSORED 401(K)

PLANS AND A FUNDED PLAN FOR UNUSED SICK LEAVE. THE PROVISION FOR THESE DEFINED

CONTRIBUTION PLANS IN 2000, 1999 AND 1998 WAS $406, $409 AND $417,

RESPECTIVELY.

THE COMPANY'S POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS CONSIST

PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING

DEPENDENTS, AND TO A LESSER EXTENT, LIFE INSURANCE TO CERTAIN GROUPS OF

RETIREES. RETIREE HEALTH CARE IS PROVIDED PRINCIPALLY UNTIL AGE 65 FOR

APPROXIMATELY HALF THOSE RETIREES WHO ARE ELIGIBLE FOR HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.

CERTAIN EMPLOYEE GROUPS, INCLUDING EMPLOYEES COVERED BY MOST UNITED AUTO

WORKERS BARGAINING AGREEMENTS, ARE PROVIDED LIFETIME HEALTH CARE COVERAGE.

BENEFIT COSTS WERE CALCULATED BASED ON ASSUMED COST GROWTH FOR RETIREE

HEALTH CARE COSTS OF A 9.5% ANNUAL RATE FOR 2000, DECREASING TO A 5.5% ANNUAL

GROWTH RATE BY 2010. IN 1999, BENEFIT COSTS FOR RETIREE HEALTH CARE WERE

CALCULATED BASED ON AN ANNUAL GROWTH RATE OF 10%, DECREASING TO A 5.5% ANNUAL

GROWTH RATE BY 2010.

IRREVOCABLE TRUST THAT HOLDS BOEING COMMON STOCK, RECEIVES DIVIDENDS, AND

DISTRIBUTES TO EMPLOYEES APPRECIATION IN VALUE ABOVE A 3% PER ANNUM THRESHOLD

RATE OF RETURN. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE TRUST HELD 39,156,280 SHARES OF

THE COMPANY'S COMMON STOCK, SPLIT EQUALLY BETWEEN TWO FUNDS, "FUND 1" AND "FUND

2." IF ON JUNE 30, 2002, THE MARKET VALUE OF FUND 1 EXCEEDS $949 (THE THRESHOLD

REPRESENTING A 3% PER ANNUM RATE OF RETURN), THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE

THRESHOLD WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO EMPLOYEES. THE JUNE 30, 2002, MARKET VALUE OF

FUND 1 AFTER DISTRIBUTION (IF ANY) WILL BE THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING ANY

POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION ON JUNE 30, 2006. SIMILARLY, IF ON JUNE 30, 2004, THE

MARKET VALUE OF FUND 2 EXCEEDS $913, THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE THRESHOLD WILL

BE DISTRIBUTED TO EMPLOYEES. SHARES HELD BY THE TRUST ON JUNE 30, 2010 AFTER

FINAL DISTRIBUTION WILL REVERT BACK TO THE COMPANY.

THE DILUTIVE SHARES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHAREVALUE TRUST ARE 5,049,765 AT

DECEMBER 31, 2000.

THE SHAREVALUE TRUST IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CONTRA-EQUITY ACCOUNT AND STATED

AT MARKET VALUE. MARKET VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ARE OFFSET TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN

CAPITAL. THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A SHARE-BASED EXPENSE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE

SHAREVALUE PROGRAM OF $72 FOR EACH YEAR PRESENTED. THE SHAREVALUE TRUST EXPENSE

IS CALCULATED UNDER THE PROVISIONS OF SFAS NO. 123.

STOCK OPTIONS

THE COMPANY'S 1997 INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN PERMITS THE GRANT OF STOCK OPTIONS,

STOCK APPRECIATION RIGHTS (SARS) AND RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS (DENOMINATED IN

STOCK OR STOCK UNITS) TO ANY EMPLOYEE OF THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES AND

CONTRACT EMPLOYEES. UNDER THE TERMS OF THE PLAN, 61,000,000 SHARES ARE

AUTHORIZED FOR ISSUANCE UPON EXERCISE OF OPTIONS, AS PAYMENT OF SARS AND AS

RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS, OF WHICH NO MORE THAN AN AGGREGATE OF 6,000,000 SHARES

ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS RESTRICTED STOCK AWARDS AND NO MORE THAN AN

AGGREGATE OF 3,000,000 SHARES ARE AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE AS RESTRICTED STOCK

THAT IS SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS BASED ON CONTINUOUS EMPLOYMENT FOR LESS THAN

THREE YEARS. THIS AUTHORIZATION FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE 1997 PLAN WILL TERMINATE

ON APRIL 30, 2007. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, NO SARS HAVE BEEN GRANTED UNDER THE

1997 PLAN. THE 1993 INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN PERMITTED THE GRANT OF OPTIONS, SARS

AND STOCK TO EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES. THE 1988 AND 1984

86

87

STOCK OPTION PLANS PERMITTED THE GRANT OF OPTIONS OR SARS TO OFFICERS OR OTHER

KEY EMPLOYEES OF THE COMPANY OR ITS SUBSIDIARIES. NO FURTHER GRANTS MAY BE

AWARDED UNDER THESE THREE PLANS.

OPTIONS AND SARS HAVE BEEN GRANTED WITH AN EXERCISE PRICE EQUAL TO THE FAIR

MARKET VALUE OF THE COMPANY'S STOCK ON THE DATE OF GRANT AND EXPIRE TEN YEARS

AFTER THE GRANT DATE. VESTING IS GENERALLY OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD WITH

PORTIONS OF A GRANT BECOMING EXERCISABLE AT ONE YEAR, THREE YEARS AND FIVE

YEARS AFTER THE GRANT DATE. SARS, WHICH HAVE BEEN GRANTED ONLY UNDER THE 1988

AND 1984 PLANS, WERE GRANTED IN TANDEM WITH STOCK OPTIONS; THEREFORE, EXERCISE

OF THE SAR CANCELS THE RELATED OPTION AND EXERCISE OF THE OPTION CANCELS THE

ATTACHED SAR.

IN 1994, MCDONNELL DOUGLAS SHAREHOLDERS APPROVED THE 1994 PERFORMANCE EQUITY

INCENTIVE PLAN. RESTRICTED STOCK ISSUED UNDER THIS PLAN PRIOR TO 1997 VESTED

UPON THE MERGER BETWEEN MCDONNELL DOUGLAS AND THE BOEING COMPANY. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2000, A TOTAL OF 594,000 SHARES HAD BEEN GRANTED AND OF THOSE

151,892 REMAIN RESTRICTED. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL COMPENSATION RELATING TO THESE

RESTRICTED SHARES IS BEING AMORTIZED TO EXPENSE OVER A PERIOD OF SIX YEARS.

UNEARNED COMPENSATION IS REFLECTED AS A COMPONENT OF SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY.

NOTE 19

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

--------------------------------

THE DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS HELD BY THE COMPANY AT DECEMBER 31, 2000,

PRIMARILY CONSISTED OF SIMPLE AND SPECIFICALLY TAILORED INTEREST RATE SWAPS AND

FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS.

THE INTEREST RATE SWAPS, WHICH ARE ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN CUSTOMER

FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND LONG-TERM DEBT, ARE DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE A DESIRED

BALANCE OF FIXED AND VARIABLE RATE POSITIONS. THESE SWAPS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS

INTEGRAL COMPONENTS OF THE ASSOCIATED RECEIVABLE AND DEBT, WITH INTEREST

ACCRUED AND RECOGNIZED BASED UPON THE EFFECTIVE RATES. DUE TO THE COMPONENT

NATURE OF THESE INTEREST RATE SWAPS, THERE ARE NO ASSOCIATED GAINS OR LOSSES.

(SEE NOTE 10, 15 AND 22.)

88

89

THE COMPANY HAS FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT WERE ENTERED INTO TO

HEDGE RECEIPT AND EXPENDITURE COMMITMENTS MADE IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE NOTIONAL AMOUNT OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS

THROUGH 2003 WAS $484, WITH UNREALIZED LOSSES, NET OF UNREALIZED GAINS, OF $23.

ADDITIONALLY, AT DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE COMPANY HAD FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS WITH A NOTIONAL VALUE OF $247 THAT WERE CARRIED AT MARKET VALUE. THE

COMPANY REALIZED A NET GAIN OF $5 ATTRIBUTABLE TO THESE CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS IN 2000.

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2001, THE COMPANY ADOPTED STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING

STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 133, ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, AS AMENDED. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES THAT THE STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL

POSITION REFLECT THE CURRENT MARKET PRICE OF DERIVATIVES. WITH THE ADOPTION OF

SFAS NO. 133, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A TRANSITION GAIN OF $1 AFTER TAX, AND AN

ADJUSTMENT TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF A LOSS OF $11 AFTER

TAX.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT CREDIT RISK ASSOCIATED

WITH THE POTENTIAL FAILURE OF ANY COUNTERPARTY TO PERFORM UNDER THE TERMS OF

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS.

NOTE 20

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK

-------------------------------------------------

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK IN

THE NORMAL COURSE OF BUSINESS, PRINCIPALLY RELATING TO CUSTOMER FINANCING

ACTIVITIES. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK INCLUDE FINANCING

COMMITMENTS, CREDIT GUARANTEES, AND PARTICIPATION IN CUSTOMER FINANCING

RECEIVABLES WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS THAT INVOLVE INTEREST RATE TERMS

DIFFERENT FROM THE UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES.

IRREVOCABLE FINANCING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER, INCLUDING

OPTIONS, SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY THROUGH 2005 TOTALED $6,230 AND $5,015 AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT NOT ALL OF THESE

COMMITMENTS WILL BE UTILIZED AND THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO ARRANGE FOR THIRD-

PARTY INVESTORS TO ASSUME A PORTION OF THE REMAINING COMMITMENTS, IF NECESSARY.

THE COMPANY HAS ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS TO ARRANGE FOR COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT

FINANCING TOTALING $288 AND $212 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999.

THE COMPANY HAD FINANCING COMMITMENTS WITH TWA RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER

TOTALING $642 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000.  ON JANUARY 10, 2001, TWA AND CERTAIN OF

ITS DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES FILED VOLUNTARY PETITIONS IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT

IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE FOR RELIEF UNDER CHAPTER 11 OF THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY

CODE.  THIS ACTION ELIMINATED THE COMPANY'S FINANCING COMMITMENT.

PARTICIPATIONS IN CUSTOMER FINANCING RECEIVABLES WITH THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS

THAT INVOLVE INTEREST RATE TERMS DIFFERENT FROM THE UNDERLYING RECEIVABLES

TOTALED $54 AND $58 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999.

THE COMPANY'S MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO CREDIT-RELATED LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH

CREDIT GUARANTEES, WITHOUT REGARD TO COLLATERAL, TOTALED $655 ($261 ASSOCIATED

WITH COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND COLLATERALIZED) AND $725 ($336 ASSOCIATED WITH

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND COLLATERALIZED) AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999.

THE COMPANY'S MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSSES ASSOCIATED WITH ASSET VALUE

GUARANTEES, WITHOUT REGARD TO COLLATERAL, TOTALED $522 AND $485 AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2000 AND 1999. THESE ASSET VALUE GUARANTEES RELATE TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

AND ARE COLLATERALIZED.

89

90

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES

INCLUDED $468 AND $561 ATTRIBUTABLE TO RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET

FINANCING COMMITMENTS.

NOTE 21

SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATIONS OF CREDIT RISK

-----------------------------------------------

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INVOLVING POTENTIAL CREDIT RISK ARE PREDOMINANTLY WITH

COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000,

OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 20 PREDOMINANTLY

RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS. OF THE $11,887 IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

AND CUSTOMER FINANCING INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

POSITION, $5,358 RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS AND $2,693 RELATED TO

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. OTHER THAN TRANS WORLD AIRLINES (TWA), DISCUSSED

HEREAFTER, NO SINGLE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMER WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS RELATING TO CUSTOMER

FINANCING. FINANCING FOR AIRCRAFT IS COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITY IN THE RELATED

ASSET, AND HISTORICALLY THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED A PROBLEM IN ACCESSING

SUCH COLLATERAL.

OF THE $5,358 OF COMMERCIAL ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND AIRCRAFT CUSTOMER

FINANCING, $4,201 RELATED TO CUSTOMERS THE COMPANY BELIEVES HAVE LESS THAN

INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. SIMILARLY, OF THE $6,230 OF IRREVOCABLE FINANCING

COMMITMENTS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER INCLUDING OPTIONS, $5,388 RELATED TO

CUSTOMERS THE COMPANY BELIEVES HAVE LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, THE COMPANY HAD CUSTOMER FINANCING IN PLACE

TOTALING $1,459 WITH TWA. THE COMPANY ALSO HAD $642 OF FINANCING COMMITMENTS

THAT HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED AS A RESULT OF THE PROCEEDINGS NOTED BELOW.  ON

JANUARY 10, 2001, TWA AND CERTAIN OF ITS DOMESTIC SUBSIDIARIES FILED VOLUNTARY

PETITIONS IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN WILMINGTON, DELAWARE FOR RELIEF UNDER

CHAPTER 11 OF THE U.S. BANKRUPTCY CODE.  TWA HAS RECEIVED THE COURT'S APPROVAL

FOR AN ASSET PURCHASE AGREEMENT WITH AMERICAN AIRLINES PURSUANT TO SECTION 363

OF THE BANKRUPTCY CODE. THE SALE OF TWA'S ASSETS TO AMERICAN IS SUBJECT TO,

AMONG OTHER THINGS, HIGHER AND BETTER OFFERS AS A RESULT OF A BIDDING PROCESS

PLUS BANKRUPTCY COURT APPROVAL. TWA HAS RECEIVED $200 IN DEBTOR IN POSSESSION

FINANCING FROM AMERICAN. THIS FINANCING IS INTENDED TO ENABLE TWA'S CONTINUED

OPERATION DURING THE TRANSITION PERIOD.

BASED ON THE COMPANY'S ASSESSMENT OF THE UNDERLYING COLLATERAL POSITION HELD

BY THE COMPANY, POSSIBLE FUTURE NON-PERFORMANCE OF FINANCING CURRENTLY EXTENDED

TO TWA WOULD NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL

POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

NOTE 22

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

-----------------------------------------------------

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE

WAS $4,928 AND $3,453, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS ESTIMATED

TO BE $4,807 AND $3,385. THE LOWER FAIR VALUE REFLECTS A DISCOUNT DUE TO

DEFERRED COLLECTION FOR CERTAIN RECEIVABLES THAT WILL BE COLLECTED OVER AN

EXTENDED PERIOD. THE CARRYING VALUE OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE IS ESTIMATED TO

APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE.

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF NOTES RECEIVABLE, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE, IS

ESTIMATED TO APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE GENERALLY NO QUOTED

MARKET PRICES AVAILABLE FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING NOTES RECEIVABLE, THE VALUATION

90

91

ASSESSMENTS WERE BASED ON THE RESPECTIVE INTEREST RATES, RISK-RELATED RATE

SPREADS AND COLLATERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000 AND 1999, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF DEBT, NET OF

CAPITAL LEASES, WAS $8,419 AND $6,346 AND THE FAIR VALUE OF DEBT, BASED ON

CURRENT MARKET RATES FOR DEBT OF THE SAME RISK AND MATURITIES, WAS ESTIMATED AT

$8,866 AND $6,393. THE COMPANY'S DEBT, HOWEVER, IS GENERALLY NOT CALLABLE UNTIL

MATURITY.

WITH REGARD TO FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE-SHEET RISK, IT IS NOT

PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF FUTURE FINANCING COMMITMENTS, AND ALL

OTHER OFF-BALANCE-SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE ONLY A

NOMINAL FAIR VALUE. THE TERMS AND CONDITIONS REFLECTED IN THE OUTSTANDING

GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS FOR FINANCING ASSISTANCE ARE NOT MATERIALLY

DIFFERENT FROM THOSE THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN NEGOTIATED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000.

NOTE 23

CONTINGENCIES

-------------

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS,

CONTRACTS AND OTHER MATTERS ARE PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY. MOST SIGNIFICANT

LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO MATTERS COVERED BY INSURANCE. MAJOR

CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF

THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING THOSE FOR DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND

REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES. DUE IN PART TO THEIR COMPLEXITY AND

PERVASIVENESS, SUCH REQUIREMENTS HAVE RESULTED IN THE COMPANY BEING INVOLVED

WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS AND REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS SINCE THE

1980S.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY ASSESSES, BASED ON IN-DEPTH STUDIES, EXPERT ANALYSES

AND LEGAL REVIEWS, ITS CONTINGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS FOR

REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED SITES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RANGES AND

PROBABILITIES OF RECOVERIES FROM OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO HAVE AND HAVE

NOT AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT AND OF RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS. THE

COMPANY'S POLICY IS TO IMMEDIATELY ACCRUE AND CHARGE TO CURRENT EXPENSE

IDENTIFIED EXPOSURES RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SITES BASED ON

CONSERVATIVE ESTIMATES OF INVESTIGATION, CLEANUP AND MONITORING COSTS TO BE

INCURRED.

THE COSTS INCURRED AND EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH

ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT HAD, AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE

COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION.  WITH RESPECT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, RELATED

CHARGES HAVE AVERAGED LESS THAN 2% OF ANNUAL NET EARNINGS.  SUCH ACCRUALS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2000, WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR THE RELATED CONTINGENT RECOVERIES

FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS, ARE LESS THAN 2% OF TOTAL LIABILITIES.

BECAUSE OF THE REGULATORY COMPLEXITIES AND RISK OF UNIDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED

SITES AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION

COSTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM THE ESTIMATED COSTS ACCRUED FOR

IDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED SITES. HOWEVER, BASED ON ALL KNOWN FACTS AND EXPERT

ANALYSES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS NOT REASONABLY LIKELY THAT IDENTIFIED

ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES WILL RESULT IN ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE COMPANY'S FINANCIAL POSITION OR OPERATING

RESULTS AND CASH FLOW TRENDS.

91

92

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS OF ITS PRACTICES

FROM WHICH CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT. SUCH

PROCEEDINGS COULD INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES,

COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION AND/OR FORFEITURES.  UNDER

GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, A COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF ITS OPERATING DIVISIONS OR

SUBDIVISIONS, CAN ALSO BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, OR

LOSE ITS EXPORT PRIVILEGES, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY

BELIEVES, BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH

GOVERNMENT DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT

ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION OR CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

IN 1991, THE U.S. NAVY NOTIFIED THE COMPANY AND GENERAL DYNAMICS CORPORATION

(THE TEAM) THAT IT WAS TERMINATING FOR DEFAULT THE TEAM'S CONTRACT FOR

DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE A-12 AIRCRAFT. THE TEAM FILED A LEGAL

ACTION TO CONTEST THE NAVY'S DEFAULT TERMINATION, TO ASSERT ITS RIGHTS TO

CONVERT THE TERMINATION TO ONE FOR "THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT," AND TO

OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR WORK DONE AND COSTS INCURRED ON THE A-12 CONTRACT BUT NOT

PAID TO DATE. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, INVENTORIES INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $581

OF RECORDED COSTS ON THE A-12 CONTRACT, AGAINST WHICH THE COMPANY HAS

ESTABLISHED A LOSS PROVISION OF $350. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVISION, WHICH WAS

ESTABLISHED IN 1990, WAS BASED ON THE COMPANY'S BELIEF, SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION

OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WOULD BE CONVERTED TO A

TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, THAT THE TEAM WOULD ESTABLISH A CLAIM FOR CONTRACT

ADJUSTMENTS FOR A MINIMUM OF $250, THAT THERE WAS A RANGE OF REASONABLY

POSSIBLE RESULTS ON TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, AND THAT IT WAS PRUDENT TO

PROVIDE FOR WHAT THE COMPANY THEN BELIEVED WAS THE UPPER RANGE OF POSSIBLE LOSS

ON TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, WHICH WAS $350.

ON JULY 1, 1999, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT

REVERSED A MARCH 31, 1998, JUDGMENT OF THE UNITED STATES COURT OF FEDERAL

CLAIMS FOR THE TEAM. THE 1998 JUDGMENT WAS BASED ON A DETERMINATION THAT THE

GOVERNMENT HAD NOT EXERCISED THE REQUIRED DISCRETION BEFORE ISSUING A

TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT. IT CONVERTED THE TERMINATION TO A TERMINATION FOR

CONVENIENCE, AND DETERMINED THE TEAM WAS ENTITLED TO BE PAID $1,200, PLUS

STATUTORY INTEREST FROM JUNE 26, 1991, UNTIL PAID. THE COURT OF APPEALS

REMANDED THE CASE TO THE COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS FOR A DETERMINATION AS TO

WHETHER THE GOVERNMENT IS ABLE TO SUSTAIN THE BURDEN OF SHOWING A DEFAULT WAS

JUSTIFIED AND OTHER PROCEEDINGS. TRIAL ON ALL ISSUES NOW IS SET FOR MAY 1,

2001. FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE A-12 LITIGATION WILL DEPEND ON THE OUTCOME OF

SUCH TRIAL AND POSSIBLE FURTHER APPEALS OR NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

IN THE COMPANY'S OPINION, THE LOSS PROVISION CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY

FOR THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE REDUCTION IN VALUE OF A-12 NET CONTRACTS IN PROCESS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2000, AS A RESULT OF A TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT FOR THE

CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT. THE COMPANY HAS BEEN PROVIDED WITH AN OPINION OF

OUTSIDE COUNSEL THAT (I) THE GOVERNMENT'S TERMINATION OF THE CONTRACT FOR

DEFAULT WAS CONTRARY TO LAW AND FACT, (II) THE RIGHTS AND OBLIGATIONS OF THE

COMPANY ARE THE SAME AS IF THE TERMINATION HAD BEEN ISSUED FOR THE CONVENIENCE

OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND (III) SUBJECT TO PREVAILING ON THE ISSUE THAT THE

TERMINATION IS PROPERLY ONE FOR THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT, THE PROBABLE

RECOVERY BY THE COMPANY IS NOT LESS THAN $250.

ON OCTOBER 31, 1997, A FEDERAL SECURITIES LAWSUIT WAS FILED AGAINST THE

COMPANY IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON, IN

SEATTLE. THE LAWSUIT NAMES AS DEFENDANTS THE COMPANY AND THREE OF ITS THEN

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. ADDITIONAL LAWSUITS OF A SIMILAR NATURE HAVE BEEN FILED IN

THE SAME COURT. THESE LAWSUITS WERE CONSOLIDATED ON FEBRUARY 24, 1998. THE

92

93

LAWSUITS GENERALLY ALLEGE THAT THE DEFENDANTS DESIRED TO KEEP THE COMPANY'S

SHARE PRICE AS HIGH AS POSSIBLE IN ORDER TO ENSURE THAT THE MCDONNELL DOUGLAS

SHAREHOLDERS WOULD APPROVE THE MERGER AND, IN THE CASE OF THE INDIVIDUAL

DEFENDANTS, TO BENEFIT DIRECTLY FROM THE SALE OF BOEING STOCK DURING THE PERIOD

FROM APRIL 7, 1997 THROUGH OCTOBER 22, 1997. BY ORDER DATED MAY 1, 2000, THE

COURT CERTIFIED TWO SUBCLASSES OF PLAINTIFFS IN THE ACTION: A. ALL PERSONS OR

ENTITIES WHO PURCHASED BOEING STOCK OR CALL OPTIONS OR WHO SOLD PUT OPTIONS

DURING THE PERIOD FROM JULY 21, 1997, THROUGH OCTOBER 22, 1997, AND B. ALL

PERSONS OR ENTITIES WHO PURCHASED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS STOCK ON OR AFTER APRIL 7,

1997, AND WHO HELD SUCH STOCK UNTIL IT CONVERTED TO BOEING STOCK PURSUANT TO

THE MERGER. THE PLAINTIFFS SEEK COMPENSATORY DAMAGES AND TREBLE DAMAGES. THE

ACTION NOW IS SET FOR TRIAL ON MARCH 7, 2002. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE

ALLEGATIONS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND THAT THE OUTCOME OF THESE LAWSUITS WILL NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS EARNINGS, CASH FLOW OR FINANCIAL

POSITION.

ON OCTOBER 19, 1999, AN INDICTMENT WAS RETURNED BY A FEDERAL GRAND JURY

SITTING IN THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CHARGING THAT MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION

(MDC), A WHOLLY OWNED SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, AND MDC'S DOUGLAS AIRCRAFT

COMPANY DIVISION, CONSPIRED TO AND MADE FALSE STATEMENTS AND CONCEALED MATERIAL

FACTS ON EXPORT LICENSE APPLICATIONS AND IN CONNECTION WITH EXPORT LICENSES,

AND POSSESSED AND SOLD MACHINE TOOLS IN VIOLATION OF THE EXPORT ADMINISTRATION

ACT. THE INDICTMENT ALSO CHARGED ONE EMPLOYEE WITH PARTICIPATION IN THE ALLEGED

CONSPIRACY. (THE INDICTMENT HAS SINCE BEEN DISMISSED AS AGAINST THAT EMPLOYEE

BUT HIS DISMISSAL IS THE SUBJECT OF A PENDING APPEAL BY THE GOVERNMENT TO THE

U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE D.C. CIRCUIT.) THE INDICTMENT RELATES TO THE SALE

AND EXPORT TO CHINA IN 1993-1995 OF SURPLUS, USED MACHINE TOOLS SOLD BY DOUGLAS

AIRCRAFT COMPANY TO CHINA NATIONAL AERO-TECHNOLOGY IMPORT AND EXPORT

CORPORATION FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH THE MD-80/90 COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

TRUNKLINER PROGRAM IN CHINA.

AS A RESULT OF THE INDICTMENT, THE DEPARTMENT OF STATE HAS DISCRETION TO

DENY DEFENSE-RELATED EXPORT PRIVILEGES TO MDC OR A DIVISION OR SUBSIDIARY OF

MDC. THE AGENCY EXERCISED THAT DISCRETION ON JANUARY 5, 2000, BY ESTABLISHING A

"DENIAL POLICY" WITH RESPECT TO DEFENSE-RELATED EXPORTS OF MDC AND ITS

SUBSIDIARIES. MOST OF MDC'S MAJOR EXISTING DEFENSE PROGRAMS WERE, HOWEVER,

EXCEPTED FROM THAT POLICY DUE TO OVERRIDING U.S. FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL

SECURITY INTERESTS. OTHER EXCEPTIONS HAVE BEEN GRANTED. THERE CAN, HOWEVER, BE

NO ASSURANCE AS TO HOW THE DEPARTMENT WILL EXERCISE ITS DISCRETION AS TO

PROGRAM OR TRANSACTION EXCEPTIONS FOR OTHER PROGRAMS OR FUTURE DEFENSE-RELATED

EXPORTS. IN ADDITION, THE DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE HAS AUTHORITY TO TEMPORARILY

DENY OTHER EXPORT PRIVILEGES TO, AND THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE HAS AUTHORITY TO

SUSPEND OR DEBAR FROM CONTRACTING WITH THE MILITARY DEPARTMENTS, MDC OR A

DIVISION OR SUBSIDIARY OF MDC. NEITHER AGENCY HAS TAKEN ACTION ADVERSE TO MDC

OR ITS DIVISIONS OR SUBSIDIARIES THUS FAR. BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE

INFORMATION, THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT ACTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION OR CONTINUING OPERATIONS. IN THE

UNANTICIPATED EVENT OF A CONVICTION, MDC WOULD BE SUBJECT TO DEPARTMENT OF

STATE AND DEPARTMENT OF COMMERCE DENIALS OR REVOCATIONS OF MDC EXPORT LICENSES.

MDC ALSO WOULD BE SUBJECT TO DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE DEBARMENT PROCEEDINGS.

ON FEBRUARY 25, 2000, A PURPORTED CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT ALLEGING GENDER

DISCRIMINATION AND HARASSMENT WAS FILED AGAINST THE BOEING COMPANY, BOEING

NORTH AMERICAN, INC., AND MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION. THE COMPLAINT, FILED

WITH THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE, ALLEGES THAT THE COMPANY HAS

ENGAGED IN A PATTERN AND PRACTICE OF UNLAWFUL DISCRIMINATION, HARASSMENT AND

RETALIATION AGAINST FEMALES OVER THE COURSE OF MANY YEARS. THE COMPLAINT, BECK

93

94

V. BOEING, NAMES 28 WOMEN WHO HAVE WORKED FOR BOEING IN THE PUGET SOUND AREA;

WICHITA, KANSAS; ST. LOUIS, MISSOURI; AND TULSA, OKLAHOMA. ON MARCH 15, AN

AMENDED COMPLAINT WAS FILED NAMING AN ADDITIONAL 10 PLAINTIFFS, INCLUDING THE

FIRST FROM CALIFORNIA. THE LAWSUIT ATTEMPTS TO REPRESENT ALL WOMEN WHO

CURRENTLY WORK FOR THE COMPANY, OR WHO HAVE WORKED FOR THE COMPANY IN THE PAST

SEVERAL YEARS (APPROXIMATELY 70,000).

THE COMPANY HAS DENIED THE ALLEGATION THAT IT HAS ENGAGED IN ANY UNLAWFUL

"PATTERN AND PRACTICE" AND BELIEVES THAT THE PLAINTIFFS CANNOT SATISFY THE

RIGOROUS REQUIREMENTS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE THE CLASS ACTION STATUS THEY SEEK.

THE DEADLINE FOR FILING PLAINTIFFS' MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION, ORIGINALLY

SCHEDULED TO BE HEARD ON AUGUST 25, 2000, NOW HAS BEEN EXTENDED UNTIL MAY 2001.

THE COMPANY INTENDS TO VIGOROUSLY CONTEST THIS LAWSUIT.

IN OCTOBER 1999, A NUMBER OF INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS FILED A FEDERAL COURT

ACTION ALLEGING EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION BASED UPON RACE AND NATIONAL (SIC)

ORIGIN (ASIAN). THIS ACTION WAS SUBSEQUENTLY CONSOLIDATED WITH A RELATED SUIT

MAKING SIMILAR ALLEGATIONS AND CLASS ACTION STATUS WAS SOUGHT IN A MOTION FILED

ON JANUARY 3, 2001. THE CLASS FOR WHICH CERTIFICATION IS BEING SOUGHT WOULD

INCLUDE ALL NON-MANAGEMENT SALARIED WORKERS OF ASIAN DESCENT EMPLOYED IN

WASHINGTON STATE. THE ACTION IS LIMITED TO CLAIMS OF ALLEGED DISCRIMINATION IN

COMPENSATION, PROMOTION, TRANSFER, RETENTION RATING, AND JOB CLASSIFICATION.

THE COMPANY HAS DENIED THE ALLEGATIONS OF DISCRIMINATION AND PLANS TO OPPOSE

THE MOTION FOR CLASS CERTIFICATION AND VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THE LAWSUIT. THE

COURT'S DECISION ON CLASS CERTIFICATION IS ANTICIPATED TO BE ISSUED AS EARLY AS

THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2001.
