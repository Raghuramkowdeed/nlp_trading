THE BOEING COMPANY, TOGETHER

WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES (HEREIN REFERRED TO AS THE COMPANY), IS ONE OF

THE WORLDS MAJOR AEROSPACE FIRMS. THE COMPANY IS ORGANIZED BASED ON THE

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IT OFFERS. THE COMPANY OPERATES IN FOUR PRINCIPAL

SEGMENTS: COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES, MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS, SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS, AND BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION (BCC). THE COMPANY ALSO

ESTABLISHED AN OTHER SEGMENT CLASSIFICATION WHICH PRINCIPALLY INCLUDES THE

ACTIVITIES OF CONNEXION BY BOEING

SM

, A TWO-WAY DATA COMMUNICATIONS

SERVICE FOR GLOBAL TRAVELERS; AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT, A BUSINESS UNIT DEVELOPING

NEW APPROACHES TO A GLOBAL SOLUTION TO ADDRESS AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT ISSUES;

AND BOEING TECHNOLOGY, AN ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION FOCUSED

ON INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOGIES, IMPROVED PROCESSES AND THE CREATION OF NEW PRODUCTS.

REVENUES, EARNINGS FROM

OPERATIONS AND OTHER FINANCIAL DATA OF THE COMPANYS BUSINESS SEGMENTS FOR

THE THREE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, ARE SET FORTH ON PAGES 80-83 OF THE

COMPANYS 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS AND ARE INCORPORATED HEREIN BY

REFERENCE.

THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

SEGMENT IS INVOLVED IN DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND MARKETING OF COMMERCIAL JET

AIRCRAFT AND PROVIDING RELATED SUPPORT SERVICES, PRINCIPALLY TO THE COMMERCIAL

AIRLINE INDUSTRY WORLDWIDE. THE COMPANY IS A LEADING PRODUCER OF COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT AND OFFERS A FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL JETLINERS DESIGNED TO MEET A BROAD

SPECTRUM OF PASSENGER AND CARGO REQUIREMENTS OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN AIRLINES.

THIS FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT CURRENTLY INCLUDES THE 717, 737

NEXT-GENERATION, AND 757 STANDARD-BODY MODELS AND THE 747, 767 AND 777 WIDE-BODY

MODELS. FINAL DELIVERIES OF THE MD-80, MD-90 AND 737 CLASSIC AIRCRAFT OCCURRED

IN 2000. FINAL DELIVERY OF THE MD-11 AIRCRAFT OCCURRED IN 2001.

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT ARE

NORMALLY SOLD ON A FIRM FIXED-PRICE BASIS WITH AN INDEXED PRICE ESCALATION

CLAUSE. THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO DELIVER JET AIRCRAFT ON SCHEDULE IS

DEPENDENT UPON A VARIETY OF FACTORS, INCLUDING EXECUTION OF INTERNAL PERFORMANCE

PLANS, AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS, PERFORMANCE OF SUPPLIERS AND

SUBCONTRACTORS, AND REGULATORY CERTIFICATION. THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND MAJOR DERIVATIVES INVOLVES INCREASED RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH

MEETING DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION AND CERTIFICATION SCHEDULES.

THE WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR

COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT IS PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY LONG-TERM TRENDS IN AIRLINE

PASSENGER TRAFFIC. THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS UNDERLYING LONG-TERM TRAFFIC GROWTH ARE

SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH, BOTH IN DEVELOPED AND EMERGING COUNTRIES, AND

POLITICAL STABILITY. DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS

FURTHER INFLUENCED BY AIRLINE INDUSTRY PROFITABILITY, WORLD TRADE POLICIES,

GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED UPON

AIRCRAFT OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, AND PRICE AND OTHER COMPETITIVE

FACTORS.

COMMERCIAL AVIATION HAS

BEEN IMPACTED BY AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT BEGAN IN 2001 AND CONTINUED THROUGH

2002. IN ADDITION, THE INDUSTRY SUFFERED A TREMENDOUS SHOCK FROM THE TERRORIST

ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. AIR TRAVEL IN MOST AREAS OF THE WORLD HAS NOT

RECOVERED TO THE VOLUME CARRIED BY THE AIRLINES IN 2000, WHICH IS AFFECTING

PROFITABILITY FOR MANY AIRLINES. U.S. FULL SERVICE AIRLINES HAVE SUFFERED THE

GREATEST LOSSES. HOLIDAY TRAFFIC IN 2002 FOR THE U.S. AIRLINES SHOWED AN

IMPROVEMENT AND MOST CARRIERS INDICATED BETTER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER,

THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS FOR ONLY A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THE MAJOR U.S. FULL

SERVICE AIRLINES REPORTED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FOR 2002. IN CONTRAST, LOW FARE

AIRLINES IN THE U.S. AND IN EUROPE ARE REPORTING POSITIVE FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

ARE GROWING. EUROPEAN NETWORK AIRLINES ARE EXPECTED TO SHOW BETTER RESULTS THAN

THEIR U.S. COUNTERPARTS FOR THE FISCAL PERIOD ENDING IN MARCH OF 2003. TRAFFIC

BETWEEN ASIA AND EUROPE HAS REBOUNDED TO PRE-SEPTEMBER 11 LEVELS. THIS TREND

COMBINED WITH STRONGER TRAFFIC WITHIN THE REGION IS OFFSETTING THE SLOW GROWTH

OVER THE PACIFIC PERMITTING MOST ASIAN AIRLINES TO SHOW PROFITS.

THE COMPANYS

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT SALES ARE SUBJECT TO INTENSE COMPETITION, PRIMARILY FROM

AIRBUS INDUSTRIE. TO MEET COMPETITION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINS A PROGRAM DIRECTED

TOWARD CONTINUALLY ENHANCING THE PERFORMANCE AND CAPABILITY OF ITS PRODUCTS AND

HAS A FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT TO MEET VARIED AND CHANGING AIRLINE

REQUIREMENTS. ADDITIONALLY, EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES NETWORK FOR

AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN MAINTAINING HIGH CUSTOMER

SATISFACTION.

- 1 -

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY

EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE CURRENT MODELS, AND ASSESSES THE MARKETPLACE

TO ENSURE THAT ITS FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT IS WELL POSITIONED TO MEET

FUTURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. THE FUNDAMENTAL STRATEGY IS TO

MAINTAIN A BROAD PRODUCT LINE RESPONSIVE TO CHANGING MARKET CONDITIONS BY

MAXIMIZING COMMONALITY AMONG THE BOEING FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.

ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BY OFFERING PRODUCTS WITH THE HIGHEST STANDARDS OF

QUALITY, SAFETY, TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE, ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND IN-SERVICE

SUPPORT.

THE MAJOR FOCUS OF

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES OVER THE PAST THREE YEARS HAS BEEN

THE 737 NEXT-GENERATION-900 MODEL, THE 747-400ER, THE 747-400ERF, THE 767-400ER,

THE 777-200LR, THE 777-300ER, AND A SONIC CRUISER AIRPLANE. THE INITIAL DELIVERY

OF THE 737-900, THE LARGEST MEMBER OF THE 737 NEXT-GENERATION FAMILY, OCCURRED

IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2001. INITIAL DELIVERY OF THE 767-400ER, A STRETCHED

VERSION OF THE 767-300ER CAPABLE OF CARRYING OVER 300 PASSENGERS IN A TWO-CLASS

CONFIGURATION, OCCURRED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2000. CERTIFICATION AND FIRST

DELIVERY OF THE 747-400ER AND 747-400ERF OCCURRED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2002. CERTIFICATION AND FIRST DELIVERY OF THE 777-300ER AND 777-200LR IS

SCHEDULED FOR 2004 AND 2006, RESPECTIVELY.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2002, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT WILL FOCUS ITS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON THE

DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT 200- TO 250-SEAT AIRPLANE THAT WILL FLY 7,000 TO

8,000 NAUTICAL MILES WITH 15 TO 20 PERCENT LOWER FUEL USAGE AT THE TOP END OF

TODAYS COMMERCIAL JET SPEEDS. THE MARKET POTENTIAL FOR A NEW AIRPLANE OF

THIS SIZE IS FORECASTED AT UP TO 3,000 UNITS OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS. THE COMPANY

EXPECTS TO FORMALLY OFFER THE NEW AIRPLANE TO CUSTOMERS IN EARLY 2004, WITH

ENTRY INTO SERVICE TARGETED FOR 2008.

THE MAJOR TRENDS THAT SHAPE

THE CURRENT ENVIRONMENT OF THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT AND

THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT INCLUDE SIGNIFICANT BUT RELATIVELY FLAT

U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE AND SPACE BUDGETS; RAPID EXPANSION OF INFORMATION AND

COMMUNICATION TECHNOLOGIES; THE NEED FOR LOW COST, ASSURED ACCESS TO SPACE; AND

A CONVERGENCE OF MILITARY, CIVIL AND COMMERCIAL MARKETS.

THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND

MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT IS INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION,

MODIFICATION AND SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS AND RELATED SYSTEMS: MILITARY

AIRCRAFT, INCLUDING FIGHTER, TRANSPORT AND ATTACK AIRCRAFT; HELICOPTERS; AND

MISSILES.

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF

DEFENSE (DOD), REPRESENTS NEARLY 50% OF THE WORLDS DEFENSE BUDGET, AND

REMAINS THE PRINCIPAL CUSTOMER OF THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS

SEGMENT. SEVERAL TRENDS ARE EMERGING THAT ARE SHAPING CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR IN THIS

MARKET. U.S. MILITARY FORCE STRUCTURE IS SHRINKING, ITS PLATFORMS ARE AGING, AND

THE TEMPO OF OPERATIONS AND ENGAGEMENTS WORLDWIDE REMAINS HIGH. THE UNITED

STATES CURRENT MILITARY ACTIVITY DEMONSTRATES THE VALUE OF SYSTEMS

SOLUTIONS THAT ALLOW ALL SYSTEMS TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER; OPERATE OVER

LONGER RANGES; AND ARE UNMANNED AND PROVIDE THE ADVANTAGES OF PRECISION,

PERSISTENCE AND SELECTIVE ENGAGEMENT. THESE FACTORS ARE DRIVING THE U.S. DOD,

ALONG WITH MILITARIES WORLDWIDE, TO FOCUS ON WAYS TO TRANSFORM THEIR FORCES AND

THE WAY THEY OPERATE.

EVENTS LIKE NUCLEAR

PROLIFERATION IN NORTH KOREA, OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM AND THE CONTINUED WAR

ON TERRORISM, HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY GOALS ARE NOT

RHETORICAL. THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE AND A DURABLE NEED TO MAINTAIN STRONG U.S.

DEFENSE CAPABILITIES COVERING A VERY BROAD SPECTRUM OF THREATS AND RESPONSES.

NEAR-TERM DOD BUDGETS HAVE INCREASED, AND LONGER-RANGE FORECASTS EXPECT DOD

BUDGETS TO GROW FASTER THAN ANTICIPATED PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. HOWEVER,

WITH A SOFTENING GLOBAL ECONOMY AND ANTICIPATED FEDERAL BUDGET TENSIONS,

ALLOCATIONS TO DOD PROCUREMENT ARE UNLIKELY TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS

SUGGESTS THAT THE DOD WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY STRATEGIES

EMPHASIZING NETWORK-CENTRIC OPERATIONS, LONG RANGE STRIKE, UNMANNED AIR COMBAT

AND RECONNAISSANCE VEHICLES, PRECISION GUIDED WEAPONS AND CONTINUED

PRIVATIZATION OF LOGISTICS AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE OVERALL

EFFECTIVENESS WHILE MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER COSTS. THE COMPANYS

CAPABILITIES AND PROGRAMS ARE WELL SUITED TO PROVIDE THE MILITARY CAPABILITIES

ESSENTIAL TO MEET THE CHALLENGES FACING OUR NATION.

- 2 -

THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING

TO INVEST IN BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WHERE IT CAN USE ITS CUSTOMER KNOWLEDGE,

TECHNICAL STRENGTH AND LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES TO SHAPE THE

MARKET. CURRENT MAJOR DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS INCLUDE THE F/A-22 RAPTOR, V-22

OSPREY TILTROTOR AIRCRAFT, C-130 AVIONICS MODERNIZATION PROGRAM (AMP), THE

RAH-66 COMANCHE HELICOPTER AND THE UNMANNED COMBAT AIR VEHICLE (UCAV). BOTH THE

V-22 AND F/A-22 PROGRAMS HAVE TRANSITIONED TO LOW-RATE INITIAL PRODUCTION BUT

ALSO CONTINUE DEVELOPMENTAL ACTIVITIES. THE CH-47 CHINOOK IS CURRENTLY

TRANSITIONING FROM DEVELOPMENT TO PRODUCTION OF A MAJOR NEW UPGRADE PROGRAM.

CURRENT PRODUCTS IN THE TACTICAL MISSILES MARKET INCLUDE THE HARPOON BLOCK II,

SLAM-ER, CALCM AND THE JOINT DIRECT ATTACK MUNITION (JDAM). FUTURE PROGRAMS

INCLUDE THE SMALL DIAMETER BOMB AND THE COMPANY IS AGGRESSIVELY PURSUING

OPPORTUNITIES THAT UTILIZE HIGH-SPEED TECHNOLOGY FOR THE NEXT-GENERATION

MISSILE.

INVESTMENTS IN UNMANNED

SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS CAPABILITIES

IN ARCHITECTURES, SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND WEAPON SYSTEMS TECHNOLOGIES

TO PROVIDE TRANSFORMATIONAL CAPABILITIES FOR THE U.S. MILITARY. INVESTMENT IS

CONTINUING IN THE 767 TANKER PROGRAMS FOR THE U.S. AIR FORCE AND INTERNATIONAL

CUSTOMERS. COMPANY INVESTMENTS IN AIRBORNE ELECTRONIC ATTACK AND PRECISION

WEAPONS AND ADVANCED ROTORCRAFT SYSTEMS ARE EXPANDING ITS BREADTH OF PRODUCTS

AND CAPABILITIES ENABLING IT TO ACCESS LARGER PORTIONS OF THE COMBAT SYSTEMS

MARKETS.

THE SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT IS INVOLVED IN THE RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, PRODUCTION,

MODIFICATION AND SUPPORT OF THE FOLLOWING PRODUCTS AND RELATED SYSTEMS: SPACE

SYSTEMS; MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS; SATELLITES AND SATELLITE LAUNCHING VEHICLES;

ROCKET ENGINES; AND INFORMATION AND BATTLE MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS.

ON OCTOBER 6, 2000, THE

COMPANY ACQUIRED HUGHES SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES AND RELATED

OPERATIONS. THE ACQUIRED BUSINESSES ARE OPERATED UNDER THE NAME OF BOEING

SATELLITE SYSTEMS (BSS). BSS PROVIDES SPACE-BASED COMMUNICATIONS,

RECONNAISSANCE, SURVEILLANCE AND IMAGING SYSTEMS. BSS ALSO MANUFACTURES

COMMERCIAL COMMUNICATIONS SATELLITES. ALSO INCLUDED IN THE ACQUISITIONS ARE

HUGHES ELECTRON DYNAMICS, A SUPPLIER OF ELECTRONIC COMPONENTS FOR SATELLITES;

SPECTROLAB, A PROVIDER OF SOLAR CELLS AND PANELS FOR SATELLITES; AND A SHARE OF

HRL LABORATORIES, A RESEARCH CENTER. BSS IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS PART OF THE SPACE

AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT.

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

SEGMENT BUSINESS PERFORMED UNDER COST-REIMBURSEMENT-TYPE CONTRACTS CURRENTLY

INCLUDE THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE PROGRAM,

SPACE SHUTTLE FLIGHT OPERATIONS AND SPACE SHUTTLE MAIN ENGINE.

THE TOTAL HUMAN SPACE

FLIGHT AND EXPLORATION MARKET IS FORECASTED TO BE RELATIVELY FLAT OVER THE NEXT

TEN YEARS. THIS FORECAST IS BASED ON BUDGET PROJECTIONS FOR NASA, THE PRIMARY

CUSTOMER IN THIS MARKET. THE COMPANY IS OBSERVING CHANGES IN DIRECTION AND

EMPHASIS WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW VISION AND MISSION. OVER THE PAST YEAR

NASA HAS DEVELOPED A NEW INTEGRATED SPACE TRANSPORTATION PLAN (ISTP) TO

IMPLEMENT THEIR NEW VISION. THIS PLAN IS DESIGNED TO BENEFIT THE INTERNATIONAL

SPACE STATION, SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM, AND THE AGENCYS SCIENCE AND RESEARCH

OBJECTIVES. THE NEW ISTP DEDICATES MORE RESOURCES TO THE SPACE STATION PROGRAM,

PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO EXTEND THE LIFE AND ENHANCE THE SAFETY AND

RELIABILITY OF THE AGENCYS ORBITER FLEET, BOOSTS FUNDING FOR SCIENCE-BASED

PAYLOADS AND RESEARCH, AND RESTRUCTURES NASAS SPACE LAUNCH INITIATIVE. THE

SPACE LAUNCH INITIATIVE WILL NOW FOCUS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CREW TRANSPORT

VEHICLE TO FERRY SPACE STATION CREWMEMBERS, ALONG WITH A CONTINUED TECHNOLOGY

EFFORT TO IDENTIFY FUTURE REUSABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES. THE

COMPANYS SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT IS WELL POSITIONED TO JOIN WITH

NASA TO HELP REALIZE THEIR VISION USING THE EXPERTISE THE COMPANY HAS GAINED

FROM ITS PRIME CONTRACTOR ROLE ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM AND THE

INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND AN INTEGRAL PLAYER IN THE SPACE LAUNCH

INITIATIVE PROGRAM.

- 3 -

ON FEBRUARY 1, 2003, THE

COUNTRY EXPERIENCED THE TRAGIC LOSS OF SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA AND ITS

SEVEN-PERSON CREW. THE COMPANY IS ASSISTING NASA TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THIS

ACCIDENT. THIS ACCIDENT DID NOT IMPACT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR 2002, AND IT IS TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS OPERATIONS FOR 2003 AND BEYOND.

IN THE COMMUNICATIONS

MARKET, THE COMPANY IS INVESTING TO ENABLE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN EXISTING

AIR/GROUND PLATFORMS, INCREASE COMMUNICATIONS AVAILABILITY AND BANDWIDTH THROUGH

MORE ROBUST SPACE SYSTEMS, AND LEVERAGE INNOVATIVE COMMUNICATIONS CONCEPTS.

INVESTMENTS WERE MADE IN GLOBAL SITUATIONAL AWARENESS CONCEPTS TO DEVELOP

COMMUNICATION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURES TO SUPPORT VARIOUS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES

INCLUDING FUTURE COMBAT SYSTEMS, JOINT TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEM, FAB-T AND GLOBAL

MISSILE DEFENSE. A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE COMPANYS SUPPORT OF THESE DOD

TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMS IS THE INVESTMENT IN THE BOEING INTEGRATION CENTER WHERE

THE COMPANYS NETWORK CENTRIC OPERATIONS CONCEPTS ARE DEVELOPED IN

PARTNERSHIP WITH ITS CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY ALSO WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE FOCUSED

INVESTMENTS THAT WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEXT-GENERATION SPACE

INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS.

WITHIN THE SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES THE COMPANY CONTINUED INVESTING IN THE NEW DELTA IV

EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE, WHICH RESULTED IN ITS SUCCESSFUL INAUGURAL COMMERCIAL

LAUNCH IN NOVEMBER OF 2002. THIS PRODUCT GIVES THE COMPANY GREATER ACCESS TO A

PORTION OF THE LAUNCH MARKET THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY UNAVAILABLE WITH THE DELTA II

ROCKET ALONE. THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT HAS CONTINUED TO BE THE

PREMIER PROVIDER OF AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING SYSTEMS WITH THE EXECUTION OF THE

AGREEMENT WITH THE TURKISH GOVERNMENT FOR FOUR NEW AIRBORNE EARLY WARNING AND

CONTROL (AEW&C) SYSTEMS AIRCRAFT AND CONTINUED TECHNICAL PROGRESS ON THE

PREVIOUSLY AWARDED AUSTRALIAN AEW&C CONTRACT.

THE ACQUISITION AND MERGER

CONSOLIDATIONS AMONG U.S. AEROSPACE COMPANIES HAVE RESULTED IN THREE PRINCIPAL

PRIME CONTRACTORS FOR THE DOD AND NASA, INCLUDING THE COMPANY. AS A RESULT OF

THE EXTENSIVE CONSOLIDATION IN THE DEFENSE AND SPACE INDUSTRY, THE COMPANY AND

ITS MAJOR COMPETITORS ARE ALSO PARTNERS OR MAJOR SUPPLIERS TO EACH OTHER ON

VARIOUS PROGRAMS.

THE COMPANY AND LOCKHEED

MARTIN ARE 50-50 PARTNERS IN UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL

GROUND PROCESSING OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE FLEET AND FOR SPACE-RELATED OPERATIONS

WITH THE U.S. AIR FORCE. UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE ALSO PERFORMS MODIFICATIONS,

TESTING AND CHECKOUT OPERATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO READY THE SPACE SHUTTLE FOR

LAUNCH. UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE OPERATIONS ARE PERFORMED UNDER COST-PLUS-TYPE

CONTRACTS. THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF JOINT VENTURE EARNINGS IS

RECOGNIZED AS INCOME.

THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE, IN

WHICH THE COMPANY IS A 40% PARTNER WITH RSC ENERGIA (25%) OF RUSSIA, KVAERNER

ASA (20%) OF NORWAY, AND KB YUZHNOYE/PO YUZHMASH (15%) OF UKRAINE, PROVIDES

OCEAN-BASED LAUNCH SERVICES TO COMMERCIAL SATELLITE CUSTOMERS. THE VENTURE HAD

ONE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH IN 2002. THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN THIS VENTURE AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, IS REPORTED AT ZERO, WHICH REFLECTS THE RECOGNITION OF

LOSSES REPORTED BY SEA LAUNCH IN PRIOR YEARS. THE VENTURE INCURRED LOSSES IN

2002, DUE TO THE RELATIVELY LOW VOLUME OF LAUNCHES, REFLECTING A DEPRESSED

SATELLITE MARKET.

THE BOEING CAPITAL

CORPORATION SEGMENT IS PRIMARILY ENGAGED IN THE FINANCING OF COMMERCIAL AND

PRIVATE AIRCRAFT AND COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT. BCC ACTS AS A CAPTIVE FINANCE

SUBSIDIARY FOR THE COMPANY AND PROVIDES MARKET-BASED LEASE AND LOAN FINANCING

PRIMARILY TO AIRLINES THAT PURCHASE OR LEASE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURED BY

THE COMPANY OR OTHERS. BCC COMPETES FOR AIRCRAFT FINANCE BUSINESS WITH OTHER

FINANCE COMPANIES, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND OTHER FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS.

BCC ALSO COMPETES IN THE

COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT LEASING AND FINANCE MARKETS, PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED

STATES, AGAINST A NUMBER OF LARGE TICKET COMPETITORS, MAINLY HEAVILY CAPITALIZED

LEASING COMPANIES AND RELATIONSHIP BANKS. APPROXIMATELY 22% OF BCCS

PORTFOLIO HAS BEEN GENERATED FROM COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT LEASING AND FINANCING

ACTIVITIES. COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT CONSISTS OF EXECUTIVE AIRCRAFT, MACHINE TOOLS

AND PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT, CONTAINERS AND MARINE EQUIPMENT, CHEMICAL, OIL AND GAS

EQUIPMENT AND OTHER EQUIPMENT. NEW BUSINESS VOLUME OF BCC IS FUNDED WITH DEBT

OBTAINED IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, CASH FROM OPERATIONS, AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM

THE COMPANY.

TOTAL COMPANY RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE AMOUNTED TO $1.6 BILLION, $1.9 BILLION, AND $2.0 BILLION IN

2002, 2001, AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE AMOUNT EXPENSED IN 2000 INCLUDED $557

MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT.

FUNDING NOT INCLUDED IN BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001, AND 2000, TOTALED

$34.7 BILLION, $27.5 BILLION, AND $31.3 BILLION.

IN EVALUATING THE

COMPANYS CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS, CERTAIN RISK

FACTORS SHOULD BE CONSIDERED. APPROXIMATELY 34% OF THE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

BACKLOG UNITS ARE SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY BEYOND 2005. CHANGES IN THE ECONOMIC

ENVIRONMENT AND THE FINANCIAL CONDITION OF AIRLINES SOMETIMES RESULT IN CUSTOMER

REQUESTS FOR RESCHEDULING OR CANCELLATION OF CONTRACTUAL ORDERS.

CONTRACTS WITH THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT ARE SUBJECT TO TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT OR FOR CONVENIENCE BY THE

GOVERNMENT IF DEEMED IN ITS BEST INTERESTS. CONTRACTS THAT ARE TERMINATED FOR

CONVENIENCE GENERALLY PROVIDE FOR PAYMENTS TO A CONTRACTOR FOR ITS COSTS AND A

PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF PROFIT FOR WORK ACCOMPLISHED THROUGH THE DATE OF

TERMINATION. CONTRACTS THAT ARE TERMINATED FOR DEFAULT GENERALLY PROVIDE THAT

THE GOVERNMENT PAYS ONLY FOR THE WORK IT HAS ACCEPTED, CAN REQUIRE THE COMPANY

TO PAY THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ORIGINAL CONTRACT PRICE AND THE COST TO

REPROCURE THE CONTRACT ITEMS NET OF THE VALUE OF THE WORK ACCEPTED FROM THE

ORIGINAL CONTRACTOR, AND CAN HOLD THE COMPANY LIABLE FOR DAMAGES.

THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT ON

THE AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY SOURCES, SUCH AS ELECTRICITY, AT AFFORDABLE PRICES.

THE COMPANY IS ALSO HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE AVAILABILITY OF ESSENTIAL MATERIALS,

PARTS AND SUBASSEMBLIES FROM ITS SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS. THE MOST

IMPORTANT RAW MATERIALS REQUIRED FOR THE COMPANYS AEROSPACE PRODUCTS ARE

ALUMINUM (SHEET, PLATE, FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS), TITANIUM (SHEET, PLATE,

FORGINGS AND EXTRUSIONS) AND COMPOSITES (INCLUDING CARBON AND BORON). ALTHOUGH

ALTERNATIVE SOURCES GENERALLY EXIST FOR THESE RAW MATERIALS, QUALIFICATION OF

THE SOURCES COULD TAKE A YEAR OR MORE. MANY MAJOR COMPONENTS AND PRODUCT

EQUIPMENT ITEMS ARE PROCURED OR SUBCONTRACTED ON A SOLE-SOURCE BASIS WITH A

NUMBER OF DOMESTIC AND FOREIGN COMPANIES. THE COMPANY IS DEPENDENT UPON THE

ABILITY OF ITS LARGE NUMBER OF SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS TO MEET PERFORMANCE

SPECIFICATIONS, QUALITY STANDARDS, AND DELIVERY SCHEDULES AT ANTICIPATED COSTS,

AND THEIR FAILURE TO DO SO WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT PRODUCTION SCHEDULES AND

CONTRACT PROFITABILITY, WHILE JEOPARDIZING THE ABILITY OF THE COMPANY TO FULFILL

COMMITMENTS TO ITS CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY MAINTAINS AN EXTENSIVE QUALIFICATION

AND PERFORMANCE SURVEILLANCE SYSTEM TO CONTROL RISK ASSOCIATED WITH SUCH

RELIANCE ON THIRD PARTIES.

WHILE THE COMPANY OWNS

NUMEROUS PATENTS AND HAS LICENSES UNDER PATENTS OWNED BY OTHERS RELATING TO ITS

PRODUCTS AND THEIR MANUFACTURE, IT DOES NOT BELIEVE THAT ITS BUSINESS WOULD BE

MATERIALLY AFFECTED BY THE EXPIRATION OF ANY PATENTS OR TERMINATION OF ANY

PATENT LICENSE AGREEMENTS. THE COMPANY HAS NO TRADEMARKS, FRANCHISES OR

CONCESSIONS THAT ARE CONSIDERED TO BE OF MATERIAL IMPORTANCE TO THE CONDUCT OF

ITS BUSINESS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

FEDERAL, STATE AND LOCAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS DESIGNED TO PROTECT THE

ENVIRONMENT AND TO REGULATE THE DISCHARGE OF MATERIALS INTO THE ENVIRONMENT. THE

COMPANY BELIEVES ITS POLICIES, PRACTICES AND PROCEDURES ARE PROPERLY DESIGNED TO

PREVENT UNREASONABLE RISK OF ENVIRONMENTAL DAMAGE AND THE CONSEQUENT FINANCIAL

LIABILITY TO THE COMPANY. COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS

REQUIRES CONTINUING MANAGEMENT EFFORT AND EXPENDITURES BY THE COMPANY.

COMPLIANCE WITH ENVIRONMENTAL LAWS AND REGULATIONS HAS NOT HAD IN THE PAST, AND,

THE COMPANY BELIEVES, WILL NOT HAVE IN THE FUTURE, MATERIAL EFFECTS ON THE

CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, EARNINGS OR COMPETITIVE POSITION OF THE COMPANY.

- 5 -

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

BUSINESS AND COST CLASSIFICATION REGULATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS U.S. GOVERNMENT

DEFENSE AND SPACE CONTRACTS. VIOLATIONS CAN RESULT IN CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR

ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS INVOLVING FINES, COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES,

RESTITUTION, FORFEITURES, AND SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT FROM U.S. GOVERNMENT

CONTRACTS.

SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED

STATES (PRINCIPALLY EXPORT SALES FROM DOMESTIC OPERATIONS) BY GEOGRAPHIC AREA

ARE INCLUDED ON PAGE 81 OF THE COMPANYS 2002 ANNUAL REPORT TO SHAREHOLDERS

AND INCORPORATED HEREIN BY REFERENCE. APPROXIMATELY 1% OF TOTAL SALES WERE

DERIVED FROM NON-U.S. OPERATIONS OF THE COMPANY FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN

THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002. APPROXIMATELY 40% OF THE COMPANYS

CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, WAS WITH NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS. SALES

OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES ARE INFLUENCED BY U.S. GOVERNMENT FOREIGN POLICY,

INTERNATIONAL RELATIONSHIPS, AND TRADE POLICIES OF GOVERNMENTS WORLDWIDE.

RELATIVE PROFITABILITY IS NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FROM THAT EXPERIENCED IN

THE DOMESTIC MARKET.

APPROXIMATELY 20% AND 18%

OF COMBINED ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING CONSISTED

OF AMOUNTS DUE FROM CUSTOMERS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002

AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF THESE AMOUNTS ARE PAYABLE IN U.S.

DOLLARS, AND, IN MANAGEMENTS OPINION, RELATED RISKS ARE ADEQUATELY COVERED

BY ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES. THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED MATERIALLY ADVERSE

FINANCIAL CONSEQUENCES AS A RESULT OF SALES AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE

UNITED STATES.

THE COMPANY INCURRED

EMPLOYMENT REDUCTIONS RESULTING FROM THE DECREASE IN AIRCRAFT DEMAND, WHICH

DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. THE COMPANYS

WORKFORCE LEVEL AT FEBRUARY 27, 2003, WAS APPROXIMATELY 165,000, INCLUDING

APPROXIMATELY 1,800 IN CANADA AND 2,500 IN AUSTRALIA.

MOST RUNWAYS AND TAXIWAYS

USED BY THE COMPANY ARE LOCATED ON AIRPORT PROPERTIES OWNED BY OTHERS AND ARE

USED BY THE COMPANY JOINTLY WITH OTHERS. THE COMPANYS RIGHTS TO USE SUCH

FACILITIES ARE PROVIDED FOR UNDER LONG-TERM LEASES WITH MUNICIPAL, COUNTY OR

OTHER GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES. IN ADDITION, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FURNISHES THE

COMPANY CERTAIN OFFICE SPACE, INSTALLATIONS AND EQUIPMENT AT GOVERNMENT BASES

FOR USE IN CONNECTION WITH VARIOUS CONTRACT ACTIVITIES. FACILITIES AT THE MAJOR

LOCATIONS SUPPORT ALL PRINCIPAL INDUSTRY SEGMENTS. WORK RELATED TO A GIVEN

PROGRAM MAY BE ASSIGNED TO VARIOUS LOCATIONS, BASED UPON PERIODIC REVIEW OF SHOP

LOADS AND PRODUCTION CAPABILITY.

BECAUSE OF THE ACQUISITION

OF THE AEROSPACE AND DEFENSE UNITS OF ROCKWELL, HUGHES SATELLITE, MCDONNELL

DOUGLAS, AND NUMEROUS SMALLER ACQUISITIONS, THE COMPANY IS IN THE PROCESS OF

RE-EVALUATING FACILITIES TO CONSOLIDATE REDUNDANT ACTIVITIES. PROPERTIES AND

LAND THAT DO NOT MEET LONG-TERM BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS WILL BE LEASED OUT OR

SOLD.

THE COMPANYS

PRINCIPAL PROPERTIES ARE WELL MAINTAINED AND IN GOOD OPERATING CONDITION. ALL

EXISTING FACILITIES ARE SUFFICIENT TO MEET THE COMPANYS NEAR-TERM

OPERATING REQUIREMENTS.

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,

CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS, CONTRACTS AND OTHER MATTERS ARE

PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY. MOST SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO

MATTERS COVERED BY INSURANCE. MAJOR CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS FROM WHICH CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE

PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT. SUCH PROCEEDINGS COULD INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE

GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES, COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION

AND/OR FORFEITURES. UNDER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, A COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF

ITS OPERATING DIVISIONS OR SUBDIVISIONS, CAN ALSO BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, OR LOSE ITS EXPORT PRIVILEGES, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF

INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES, BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT

THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH GOVERNMENT DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION OR CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

IN 1991, THE U.S. NAVY

NOTIFIED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS (NOW A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY) AND GENERAL

DYNAMICS CORPORATION (THE TEAM) THAT IT WAS TERMINATING FOR DEFAULT

THE TEAMS CONTRACT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE A-12

AIRCRAFT. THE TEAM FILED A LEGAL ACTION TO CONTEST THE NAVYS DEFAULT

TERMINATION, TO ASSERT ITS RIGHTS TO CONVERT THE TERMINATION TO ONE FOR

THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND TO OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR WORK

DONE AND COSTS INCURRED ON THE A-12 CONTRACT BUT NOT PAID TO DATE. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002, INVENTORIES INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $583 MILLION OF RECORDED

COSTS ON THE A-12 CONTRACT, AGAINST WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A LOSS

PROVISION OF $350 MILLION. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVISION, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN

1990, WAS BASED ON MCDONNELL DOUGLASS BELIEF, SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF

OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WOULD BE CONVERTED TO A

TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, AND THAT THE BEST ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE LOSS ON

TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE WAS $350 MILLION.

ON AUGUST 31, 2001, THE

U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ISSUED A DECISION AFTER TRIAL UPHOLDING THE

GOVERNMENTS DEFAULT TERMINATION OF THE A-12 CONTRACT ON THE GROUNDS THAT

THE TEAM COULD NOT MEET THE REVISED CONTRACT SCHEDULE UNILATERALLY IMPOSED BY

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE COURT DID NOT, HOWEVER, ENTER A MONEY JUDGMENT FOR THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT ON ITS CLAIM FOR UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS. THIS

FOLLOWED AN EARLIER TRIAL COURT DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE CONTRACTORS AND

REVERSAL OF THAT INITIAL DECISION ON APPEAL. THE TEAM APPEALED THE DECISION

TO THE COURT OF APPEALS AND IS AWAITING A DECISION. THE TEAM ALSO OBTAINED A

STAY OF THE TRIAL COURTS JUDGMENT TO PREVENT THE NAVY FROM COLLECTING ANY

ALLEGEDLY DUE AMOUNTS PRIOR TO THE DECISION BY THE COURT OF APPEALS.

IF, AFTER ALL JUDICIAL

PROCEEDINGS HAVE ENDED, THE COURTS DETERMINE CONTRARY TO THE COMPANYS

BELIEF THAT A TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WAS APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANY WOULD INCUR

AN ADDITIONAL LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $275 MILLION, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF

REMAINING INVENTORY COSTS AND ADJUSTMENTS, AND IF CONTRARY TO THE COMPANYS

BELIEF THE COURTS FURTHER HOLD THAT A MONEY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE ENTERED AGAINST

THE TEAM, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE GOVERNMENT ONE-HALF OF THE

UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS OF $1,350 MILLION PLUS STATUTORY INTEREST FROM

FEBRUARY 1991 (CURRENTLY TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $1,040 MILLION). IN THAT EVENT

THE LOSS TO THE COMPANY WOULD TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $1,465 MILLION IN PRE-TAX

CHARGES. SHOULD, HOWEVER, THE TRIAL COURTS DECISION ON TERMINATION BE

REVERSED ON APPEAL AND ITS 1998 JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF THE TEAM BE REINSTATED, THE

COMPANY WOULD RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY $957 MILLION, INCLUDING INTEREST.

- 8 -

THE COMPANY BELIEVES,

SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE TRIAL COURTS RULINGS

WITH RESPECT TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE UNILATERAL SCHEDULE AND THE

TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT ARE CONTRARY TO LAW AND FACT AND THAT THE LOSS PROVISION

ESTABLISHED BY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS IN 1990 CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR THE

REASONABLY POSSIBLE REDUCTION IN VALUE OF A-12 NET CONTRACTS IN PROCESS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002. FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE A-12 LITIGATION WILL DEPEND UPON THE

OUTCOME OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS OR POSSIBLE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE GOVERNMENT.

THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT

IN SEVEN EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION MATTERS IN WHICH CLASS CERTIFICATION IS

SOUGHT OR HAS BEEN GRANTED. THREE MATTERS ARE PENDING IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT

COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON IN SEATTLE; ONE CASE IS PENDING IN

THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA IN LOS

ANGELES; ONE CASE IS PENDING IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN ST. LOUIS

MISSOURI; ONE CASE IS PENDING IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN TULSA, OKLAHOMA;

AND THE FINAL CASE IS PENDING IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN WICHITA, KANSAS.

THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE ITS AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE OF THESE CASES. IT IS NOT

POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHAT IMPACT, IF ANY, THESE CASES COULD HAVE ON THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

THE COMPANYS PRIMARY OPERATING

SEGMENTS ARE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES, MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS, SPACE

AND COMMUNICATIONS, AND BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION (BCC), A WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE COMPANYS MOST

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES.

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING IS USED

PREDOMINATELY BY THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS AND SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENTS. THE MAJORITY OF THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED IN THESE

SEGMENTS IS PERFORMED UNDER CONTRACTS FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN

GOVERNMENTS THAT EXTEND OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS.

THE PROCESS TO ESTIMATE THE

TOTAL CONTRACT COST-REVENUE RELATIONSHIP RESULTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GROSS

MARGIN AND COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES. THESE PERCENTAGES ARE UTILIZED IN THE

RECOGNITION OF EARNINGS AND ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN CONTRACT ACCOUNTING. THE

AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF

SALES PERCENTAGES TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR EACH CONTRACT.

TOTAL CONTRACT REVENUE

ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON THE NEGOTIATED CONTRACT PRICE MODIFIED BY ASSUMPTIONS

REGARDING CONTRACT OPTIONS, CHANGE ORDERS, INCENTIVE AND AWARD PROVISIONS

ASSOCIATED WITH TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE, AND CONTRACT TERMS THAT PROVIDE FOR THE

ADJUSTMENT OF PRICES IN THE EVENT OF VARIATIONS FROM PROJECTED INFLATIONARY

TRENDS.

TOTAL CONTRACT COST

ESTIMATES ARE BASED IN A LARGE PART ON HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS

BASE AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, AND INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SUPPLIERS.

FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE TECHNICAL AND SCHEDULE RISK,

INTERNAL AND SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS VOLUME ASSUMPTIONS,

ASSET UTILIZATION, ANTICIPATED LABOR AGREEMENTS, AND INFLATIONARY TRENDS.

REVENUES UNDER CONTRACTS

WITH FIXED PRICES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS DELIVERIES ARE MADE. FOR CERTAIN

FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE OVER AN EXTENDED

PERIOD BEFORE DELIVERIES BEGIN, REVENUES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ATTAINMENT OF

PERFORMANCE MILESTONES. REVENUES UNDER CONTRACTS WITH TERMS THAT REIMBURSE FOR

COSTS INCURRED PLUS AN AGREED UPON PROFIT ARE RECORDED AS COSTS ARE INCURRED.

CONTRACTS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS TO EARN INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES IF TARGETS ARE

ACHIEVED. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED ARE RECORDED

OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD OF THE CONTRACT. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT

CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED ARE RECORDED WHEN AWARDED.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF GROSS

MARGIN AND COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES INVOLVES PROCEDURES AND PERSONNEL IN ALL

AREAS OF THE COMPANY THAT PROVIDE FINANCIAL OR PRODUCTION INFORMATION ON THE

STATUS OF CONTRACTS. THIS CONTRACT MANAGEMENT PROCESS PRODUCES THE

COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATE OF CONTRACT COST AND CONTRACT REVENUE. ESTIMATES OF

EACH SIGNIFICANT CONTRACTS COST AND REVENUE ARE REVIEWED AND REASSESSED

QUARTERLY. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES RESULT IN RECOGNITION OF CUMULATIVE

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CONTRACT PROFIT IN THE PERIOD IN WHICH CHANGES ARE MADE.

THE EXPERIENCE OVER THE

PAST TWO YEARS HAS RESULTED IN A RANGE OF PLUS OR MINUS 0.5% FOR THE COMBINED

GROSS MARGIN OF ALL CONTRACTS IN THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS AND

THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENTS. IF COMBINED GROSS MARGIN FOR ALL

CONTRACTS IN THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS AND THE SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENTS FOR ALL OF 2002 HAD BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE HIGHER OR LOWER

BY 0.5% IT WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED INCOME FOR THE YEAR BY

APPROXIMATELY $125 MILLION.

- 12 -

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

THE COMPANY USES PROGRAM

ACCOUNTING FOR ITS 7-SERIES COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAMS. PROGRAM ACCOUNTING IS

A METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED FOR

DELIVERY UNDER PRODUCTION TYPE CONTRACTS WHERE PROFITABILITY IS REALIZED OVER

MULTIPLE CONTRACTS AND YEARS. UNDER PROGRAM ACCOUNTING, INVENTORIABLE PRODUCTION

COSTS (INCLUDING OVERHEAD), PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS AND WARRANTY COSTS ARE

ACCUMULATED AND CHARGED TO REVENUE BY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF BY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR

CONTRACTS. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING

QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION

EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. TO ESTABLISH THE

RELATIONSHIP OF REVENUE TO COST OF SALES, PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES ESTIMATES

OF (A) THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN A PROGRAM, (B) THE PERIOD

OVER WHICH THE UNITS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED, AND (C) THEIR

EXPECTED SELLING PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING, AND WARRANTY COSTS

FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM.

THE RELIANCE ON ESTIMATES

IN THE USE OF PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES THE DEMONSTRATED ABILITY TO RELIABLY

ESTIMATE THE COST-REVENUE RELATIONSHIP FOR THE DEFINED PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

QUANTITY. THE FACTORS THAT MUST BE ESTIMATED INCLUDE SELLING PRICE, LABOR AND

EMPLOYEE BENEFIT COSTS, MATERIAL COSTS, PROCURED PARTS AND MAJOR COMPONENT

COSTS, AND OVERHEAD COSTS. TO MEET THIS REQUIREMENT THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A

RIGOROUS ESTIMATING PROCESS THAT IS REVIEWED AND UPDATED ON A QUARTERLY BASIS.

CHANGES IN ESTIMATE ARE RECOGNIZED ON A PROSPECTIVE BASIS.

UNDERLYING ALL ESTIMATES

USED FOR PROGRAM ACCOUNTING IS THE ASSUMED MARKET AND THE CORRESPONDING

PRODUCTION RATES. THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY IS ESTABLISHED BASED UPON THE

ASSUMED MARKET. THE TOTAL PROGRAM REVENUE IS DETERMINED BY ESTIMATING THE MODEL

MIX AND SALES PRICE FOR ALL UNSOLD UNITS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY ADDED

TOGETHER WITH THE REVENUE FOR ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS UNDER CONTRACT. THE SALES

PRICES FOR ALL UNDELIVERED UNITS WITHIN THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY INCLUDE AN

ESCALATION ADJUSTMENT THAT IS BASED ON PROJECTED ESCALATION RATES. COST

ESTIMATES ARE BASED IN A LARGE PART ON HISTORICAL PERFORMANCE TRENDS, BUSINESS

BASE AND OTHER ECONOMIC PROJECTIONS, AND INFORMATION PROVIDED BY SUPPLIERS.

FACTORS THAT INFLUENCE THESE ESTIMATES INCLUDE PRODUCTION RATES, INTERNAL AND

SUBCONTRACTOR PERFORMANCE TRENDS, ASSET UTILIZATION, ANTICIPATED LABOR

AGREEMENTS, AND INFLATIONARY TRENDS.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES

REVENUE FOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES WHEN A UNIT IS COMPLETED AND ACCEPTED BY THE

CUSTOMER. THE REVENUE RECOGNIZED IS THE PRICE NEGOTIATED WITH THE CUSTOMER

INCLUDING SPECIAL FEATURES ADJUSTED BY AN ESCALATION FORMULA. THE AMOUNT

REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES

PERCENTAGE FOR THE TOTAL REMAINING PROGRAM TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED

FOR THE QUARTER. BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE

BEGINNING OF A NEW AIRPLANE PROGRAM (KNOWN AS THE LEARNING CURVE EFFECT), THE

ACTUAL COSTS INCURRED FOR PRODUCTION OF THE EARLY UNITS IN THE PROGRAM WILL

EXCEED THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES FOR THOSE UNITS. THIS DIFFERENCE

KNOWN AS DEFERRED PRODUCTION COSTS IS INCLUDED IN INVENTORY ALONG WITH

UNAMORTIZED TOOLING COSTS.

THE EXPERIENCE OF THE LAST

TWO YEARS, WITH ALL PROGRAMS BEING RELATIVELY MATURE, HAS BEEN THAT ESTIMATE

CHANGES DUE TO MODEL MIX, ESCALATION, COST PERFORMANCE, AND ACCOUNTING QUANTITY

INCREASES HAVE RESULTED IN A RANGE OF PLUS OR MINUS 0.5% FOR THE COMBINED GROSS

MARGIN OF ALL COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAMS. IF COMBINED GROSS MARGIN FOR ALL

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAMS FOR ALL OF 2002 HAD BEEN ESTIMATED TO BE HIGHER OR

LOWER BY 0.5% IT WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED INCOME FOR THE YEAR BY

APPROXIMATELY $122 MILLION.

AIRCRAFT VALUATION

USED AIRCRAFT UNDER TRADE-IN AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO CERTAIN TRADE-IN AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE USED AIRCRAFT FROM CUSTOMERS AT A

SPECIFIC PRICE AT A FUTURE POINT IN TIME WHEN THOSE CUSTOMERS PURCHASE NEW

AIRCRAFT FROM THE COMPANY. IN THE EVENT THE COMPANY ACCEPTS AN AIRCRAFT UNDER A

TRADE-IN AGREEMENT, THE AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY SERVES AS COLLATERAL

TO OFFSET AMOUNTS PAID BY THE COMPANY TO THE CUSTOMER.

OBLIGATIONS RECORDED FROM

TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT AGREEMENTS ARE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROSS

AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO CUSTOMERS AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL. THE

FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL IS DETERMINED USING A PROCESS BASED ON THE NET PRESENT

VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT, ASSUMING THE

MOST LIKELY MARKET PLACEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE FIRST STEP IN THIS PROCESS

USES THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT OF THE MARKET FOR EACH TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT,

WHICH IN MOST INSTANCES BEGINS YEARS BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE AIRCRAFT. THERE

ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE MARKETS TO WHICH THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY PURSUES

OPPORTUNITIES TO PLACE USED AIRCRAFT. THESE MARKETS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED

TO, (1) THE RESALE MARKET, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY INCLUDE THE COST OF LONG-TERM

STORAGE, (2) THE LEASING MARKET, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR REFURBISHMENT COSTS TO

MEET THE LEASING CUSTOMERS REQUIREMENTS, OR (3) THE SCRAP MARKET.

COLLATERAL VALUATION VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON WHICH MARKET THE COMPANY

DETERMINES IS MOST LIKELY FOR EACH AIRCRAFT. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE COMPANY

UPDATES ITS VALUATION ANALYSIS BASED ON THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH

PLACING EACH AIRCRAFT INTO A MARKET. THIS QUARTERLY COLLATERAL VALUATION PROCESS

YIELDS RESULTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY LOWER THAN RESIDUAL VALUE ESTIMATES BY

INDEPENDENT SOURCES AND TENDS TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT RESULTS UPON THE ACTUAL

PLACEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT.

- 13 -

BASED ON THE BEST MARKET

INFORMATION AVAILABLE AT THE TIME, THE COMPANY DEEMED IT PROBABLE THAT IT WOULD

BE OBLIGATED TO PERFORM ON TRADE-IN AGREEMENTS WITH GROSS AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO

CUSTOMERS TOTALING $1,370 MILLION AND $1,340 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND

2001, RESPECTIVELY. ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDED $156 MILLION

AND $189 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, RESPECTIVELY, WHICH

REPRESENTS THE TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT EXPOSURE RELATED TO THESE TRADE-IN AGREEMENTS.

USING A MEASUREMENT DATE OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002, HAD THE ESTIMATE OF COLLATERAL VALUE USED TO CALCULATE ITS

OBLIGATION RELATED TO TRADE-IN AGREEMENTS BEEN 10% HIGHER OR LOWER THAN THE

COMPANYS ACTUAL ASSESSMENT, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES WOULD

HAVE DECREASED OR INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $121 MILLION. THE COMPANY

CONTINUALLY UPDATES ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF ITS TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT

PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS AND CONTINUES TO MONITOR ALL THESE OBLIGATIONS FOR ADVERSE

DEVELOPMENTS.

ASSET VALUATION FOR EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASE, HELD FOR RE-LEASE

AND COLLATERAL ON RECEIVABLES

THE FAIR VALUE OF OWNED ASSETS (EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND ASSETS

HELD FOR RE-LEASE) AND COLLATERAL ON RECEIVABLES IS PERIODICALLY ASSESSED TO

DETERMINE IF THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES AND, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, RECORDED AS IMPAIRMENT FOR

OWNED ASSETS.

THE COMPANY USES THE

AVERAGE PUBLISHED VALUE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES BASED ON THE TYPE AND AGE OF THE

AIRCRAFT TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF AIRCRAFT. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,

THE COMPANY APPLIES JUDGMENT BASED ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT TO

DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, USUALLY WHEN THE FEATURES OR UTILIZATION OF THE AIRCRAFT

VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE MORE GENERIC AIRCRAFT ATTRIBUTES COVERED BY

OUTSIDE PUBLICATIONS.

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND HELD FOR RE-LEASE

THE COMPANY REVIEWS THESE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF THESE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN ASSET UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR

HELD FOR RE-LEASE IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE IS LESS THAN THE BOOK VALUE. VARIOUS

ASSUMPTIONS ARE USED WHEN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW. THESE

ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE LEASE RATES, LEASE TERM(S), PERIODS IN WHICH THE ASSET MAY

BE HELD IN PREPARATION FOR A FOLLOW-ON LEASE, MAINTENANCE COSTS, REMARKETING

COSTS AND THE LIFE OF THE ASSET. THE DETERMINATION OF EXPECTED LEASE RATES IS

GENERALLY BASED ON OUTSIDE PUBLICATIONS. THE COMPANY USES HISTORICAL INFORMATION

AND CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS TO DETERMINE THE REMAINING ASSUMPTIONS. WHEN

IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS THE

EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OVER FAIR VALUE. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THAT HAD THE

FAIR VALUE OF SUCH ASSETS DEEMED IMPAIRED DURING 2002 BEEN 10% HIGHER OR LOWER

AT THE TIME EACH SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT HAD BEEN TAKEN, THE IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE

WOULD HAVE DECREASED OR INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $6 MILLION. THE COMPANY IS

UNABLE TO PREDICT THE MAGNITUDE OF ANY FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES (VALUATION ALLOWANCE) IS A VALUATION ACCOUNT USED TO PROVIDE FOR

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF RECEIVABLES ON THE BALANCE SHEET. THE BALANCE IS AN

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE BUT UNCONFIRMED LOSSES IN THE RECEIVABLE

PORTFOLIO. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO TWO COMPONENTS OF RECEIVABLES: (A)

SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY FOR

IMPAIRMENT, AND (B) POOLS OF RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT.

A SPECIFIC RECEIVABLE IS

REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN, BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION AND EVENTS, IT IS

PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE

CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING

UNCOLLECTIBILITY INCLUDE A CUSTOMERS EXTENDED DELINQUENCY, REQUESTS FOR

RESTRUCTURING AND FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY. A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCE IS

PROVIDED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE

AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL.

THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE

ADEQUACY OF THE GENERAL VALUATION ALLOWANCE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REMAINING POOL

OF RECEIVABLES BY ASSESSING BOTH THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AND THE APPLICABLE

DEFAULT RATE. COLLATERAL EXPOSURE FOR A PARTICULAR RECEIVABLE IS THE EXCESS OF

THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE APPLICABLE COLLATERAL VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSET. A

RECEIVABLE WITH AN ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE IS

CONSIDERED TO HAVE NO COLLATERAL EXPOSURE. THE APPLICABLE DEFAULT RATE IS

DETERMINED USING TWO COMPONENTS: CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS AND WEIGHTED-AVERAGE

REMAINING PORTFOLIO TERM. CREDIT RATINGS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR EACH CUSTOMER IN THE

PORTFOLIO. CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS ARE UPDATED BASED ON CURRENT RATING AGENCY

INFORMATION OR THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATES.

- 14 -

FOR EACH CREDIT RATING

CATEGORY, THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE IS MULTIPLIED BY AN APPLICABLE HISTORICAL

DEFAULT RATE, YIELDING A CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL EXPOSURE. HISTORICAL DEFAULT

RATES ARE PUBLISHED BY STANDARD & POORS REFLECTING BOTH THE CUSTOMER

CREDIT RATING AND THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING PORTFOLIO TERM. THE SUM OF THE

CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL EXPOSURES GENERATES AN INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE

GENERAL VALUATION ALLOWANCE. IN RECOGNITION OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ULTIMATE

LOSS EXPERIENCE AND RELATIVELY LONG DURATION OF THE PORTFOLIO, A RANGE OF

REASONABLY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF THE PORTFOLIOS CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL

EXPOSURE IS CALCULATED BY VARYING THE APPLICABLE DEFAULT RATE BY APPROXIMATELY

PLUS AND MINUS 15%. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RECORDED REPRESENTS THE BEST

ESTIMATE WITHIN THE RESULTING RANGE OF CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL EXPOSURE,

FACTORING IN CONSIDERATIONS OF RISK OF INDIVIDUAL CREDITS, CURRENT AND PROJECTED

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, AND PRIOR LOSS EXPERIENCE.

THE RESULTING RANGE OF THE

CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, WAS APPROXIMATELY

$280 MILLION TO $355 MILLION. THE COMPANY ADJUSTED THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE TO

$342 MILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR

ITS GOODWILL UNDER STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

. THIS STATEMENT REQUIRES AN

IMPAIRMENT-ONLY APPROACH TO ACCOUNTING FOR GOODWILL. BECAUSE THE COMPOSITION OF

THE COMPANY HAS CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY DUE TO VARIOUS ACQUISITIONS, GOODWILL

CONSTITUTES A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THE COMPANYS LONG-TERM ASSETS. AS A

RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 142, THE COMPANY RECORDED A PRE-TAX GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $2,410 MILLION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2002.

THE SFAS NO. 142 GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT MODEL IS A TWO-STEP PROCESS. FIRST, IT REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF THE

BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS THAT HAVE

GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO THEM. IF THE FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN BOOK

VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. IN

THIS PROCESS, A FAIR VALUE FOR GOODWILL IS ESTIMATED, BASED IN PART ON THE FAIR

VALUE OF THE OPERATIONS USED IN THE FIRST STEP, AND IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING

VALUE. THE SHORTFALL OF THE FAIR VALUE BELOW CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE

AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. SFAS NO. 142 REQUIRES GOODWILL TO BE TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AT THE SAME TIME EVERY YEAR, AND WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SUCH THAT IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY

EXIST. THE COMPANY SELECTED APRIL 1 AS ITS ANNUAL TESTING DATE.

THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE

FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. THE FORECASTS

OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS ARE BASED ON THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATE OF FUTURE

REVENUES AND OPERATING COSTS, BASED PRIMARILY ON EXISTING FIRM ORDERS, EXPECTED

FUTURE ORDERS, CONTRACTS WITH SUPPLIERS, LABOR AGREEMENTS, AND GENERAL MARKET

CONDITIONS, AND ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW AND APPROVAL BY SENIOR MANAGEMENT AND THE

BOARD OF DIRECTORS. CHANGES IN THESE FORECASTS COULD CAUSE A PARTICULAR

OPERATING GROUP TO EITHER PASS OR FAIL THE FIRST STEP IN THE SFAS NO. 142

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT MODEL, WHICH COULD SIGNIFICANTLY CHANGE THE AMOUNT OF

IMPAIRMENT RECORDED.

THE CASH FLOW FORECASTS ARE

ADJUSTED BY AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE DERIVED FROM THE COMPANYS MARKET

CAPITALIZATION PLUS A SUITABLE CONTROL PREMIUM AT THE DATE OF EVALUATION.

THEREFORE, CHANGES IN THE STOCK PRICE WILL ALSO AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT

RECORDED. AT THE DATE OF THE PREVIOUS IMPAIRMENT, A 10% INCREASE IN THE VALUE OF

BOEING COMMON STOCK WOULD HAVE REDUCED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECORDED IN THE

FIRST QUARTER OF 2002 BY APPROXIMATELY $190 MILLION. A 10% DECREASE IN THE VALUE

OF BOEING COMMON STOCK WOULD HAVE INCREASED THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE BY

APPROXIMATELY $160 MILLION.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

THE COMPANY SPONSORS

VARIOUS PENSION PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY ALSO

PROVIDES POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, CONSISTING

PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE, TO ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING

DEPENDENTS. THE LIABILITIES AND ANNUAL INCOME OR EXPENSE OF THE COMPANYS

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS ARE DETERMINED USING METHODOLOGIES THAT

INVOLVE SEVERAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE THE

DISCOUNT RATE, THE LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN, AND MEDICAL TREND (RATE OF

GROWTH FOR MEDICAL COSTS). NOT ALL NET PERIODIC PENSION INCOME OR EXPENSE IS

RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS IN THE YEAR INCURRED BECAUSE IT IS ALLOCATED TO

PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT COSTS, AND A PORTION REMAINS IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF A

REPORTING PERIOD.

THE COMPANY USES A DISCOUNT

RATE THAT IS BASED ON A POINT-IN-TIME ESTIMATE AS OF THE SEPTEMBER 30

MEASUREMENT DATE. THIS RATE IS DETERMINED BASED ON A REVIEW OF LONG-TERM, HIGH

QUALITY CORPORATE BONDS AS OF THE MEASUREMENT DATE AND USE OF MODELS THAT MATCH

PROJECTED BENEFIT PAYMENTS OF THE COMPANYS MAJOR UNITED STATES PENSION AND

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS TO COUPONS AND MATURITIES FROM HIGH QUALITY BONDS. A

25 BASIS POINT INCREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD DECREASE THE 2002 PENSION AND

OTHER POSTRETIREMENT LIABILITIES BY APPROXIMATELY $1,000 MILLION (3%) AND $230

MILLION (3%), RESPECTIVELY, AND DECREASE THE 2002 NET PERIODIC PENSION AND OTHER

POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $16 MILLION AND $11 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. A 25 BASIS POINT DECREASE IN THE DISCOUNT RATE WOULD INCREASE THE

2002 PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT LIABILITIES BY APPROXIMATELY $1,250

MILLION (3.5%) AND $250 MILLION (3.5%), RESPECTIVELY, AND INCREASE THE 2002 NET

PERIODIC PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT EXPENSE BY APPROXIMATELY $18 MILLION

AND $13 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

- 15 -

NET PERIODIC PENSION COSTS

INCLUDE AN UNDERLYING EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN. IN DEVELOPING

THIS ASSUMPTION, THE COMPANY LOOKS AT A NUMBER OF FACTORS: A REVIEW OF ASSET

CLASS RETURN BY SEVERAL OF THE COMPANYS TRUST FUND INVESTMENT ADVISORS,

LONG-TERM INFLATION ASSUMPTIONS, AND LONG-TERM HISTORICAL RETURNS FOR THE

COMPANYS PLANS. THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN IS BASED ON A

DIVERSIFIED PORTFOLIO INCLUDING DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, FIXED

INCOME, REAL ESTATE, PRIVATE EQUITIES AND UNCORRELATED ASSETS. PENSION INCOME OR

EXPENSE IS ESPECIALLY SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN THE LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET

RETURN. AN INCREASE OR DECREASE OF 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE EXPECTED LONG-TERM

RATE OF ASSET RETURN WOULD HAVE INCREASED OR DECREASED 2002 PENSION INCOME BY

APPROXIMATELY $95 MILLION.

THE 2002 POSTRETIREMENT

BENEFIT OBLIGATION FOR NON-PENSION PLANS REFLECTS A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN

MEDICAL TREND. RECENT LOSSES DUE TO HIGHER-THAN-EXPECTED INCREASES IN MEDICAL

CLAIMS COSTS HAVE CREATED AN UNRECOGNIZED LOSS IN 2002. THE COMPANY INCREASED

ITS SHORT-TERM MEDICAL TREND FOR 2003 TO REFLECT THE REVISED EXPECTATIONS OF

CONTINUED COST INCREASES IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS.

STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

IN JUNE 2001, THE FINANCIAL

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED SFAS NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET

RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003. THIS STANDARD

ADDRESSES FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED ASSETS AND THE ASSOCIATED RETIREMENT COSTS.

THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS STANDARD WILL NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN JULY 2002, THE FASB

ISSUED SFAS NO. 146,

ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL

ACTIVITIES

. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL

ACTIVITIES TO BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED. THE REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS NO.

146 APPLY PROSPECTIVELY TO ACTIVITIES THAT ARE INITIATED AFTER DECEMBER 31,

2002, AND AS SUCH, THE COMPANY CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING

THESE NEW RULES UNTIL AND UNLESS IT UNDERTAKES RELEVANT ACTIVITIES IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE FASB

ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 45 (FIN 45),

GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING AND

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF THE

INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS

, WHICH CLARIFIES THE REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS NO. 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES

, RELATING TO A GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING

FOR AND DISCLOSURES OF CERTAIN GUARANTEES ISSUED. FIN 45 REQUIRES ENHANCED

DISCLOSURES FOR CERTAIN GUARANTEES. IT ALSO WILL REQUIRE CERTAIN GUARANTEES THAT

ARE ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002, INCLUDING CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY

GUARANTEES, TO BE INITIALLY RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. FOR

GUARANTEES ISSUED ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 31, 2002, LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED WHEN

AND IF PAYMENTS BECOME PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS FIN 45 TO

HAVE THE GENERAL EFFECT OF DELAYING RECOGNITION FOR A PORTION OF THE

REVENUE FOR PRODUCT SALES THAT ARE ACCOMPANIED BY CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY

GUARANTEES. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION PROVISIONS ARE EFFECTIVE

PROSPECTIVELY, AND THE COMPANY CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING

FIN 45 UNTIL GUARANTEES ARE ISSUED OR MODIFIED IN FUTURE PERIODS, AT WHICH TIME

THEIR RESULTS WILL BE INITIALLY REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS DISCUSSION.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB

ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 46 (FIN 46),

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES

, WHICH CLARIFIES THE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN

NO. 51,

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

, RELATING TO CONSOLIDATION OF

CERTAIN ENTITIES. FIRST, FIN 46 WILL REQUIRE IDENTIFICATION OF THE

COMPANYS PARTICIPATION IN VARIABLE INTERESTS ENTITIES (VIE), WHICH ARE

DEFINED AS ENTITIES WITH A LEVEL OF INVESTED EQUITY THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO

FUND FUTURE ACTIVITIES TO PERMIT THEM TO OPERATE ON A STAND ALONE BASIS, OR

WHOSE EQUITY HOLDERS LACK CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL

INTEREST. FOR ENTITIES IDENTIFIED AS VIE, FIN 46 SETS FORTH A MODEL TO EVALUATE

POTENTIAL CONSOLIDATION BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF WHICH PARTY TO THE VIE, IF

ANY, BEARS A MAJORITY OF THE EXPOSURE TO ITS EXPECTED LOSSES, OR STANDS TO GAIN

FROM A MAJORITY OF ITS EXPECTED RETURNS. FIN 46 ALSO SETS FORTH CERTAIN

DISCLOSURES REGARDING INTERESTS IN VIE THAT ARE DEEMED SIGNIFICANT, EVEN IF

CONSOLIDATION IS NOT REQUIRED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE

APPLICATION OF FIN 46 AS IT RELATES TO ITS VARIABLE INTERESTS. SEE OFF-BALANCE

SHEET ARRANGEMENTS DISCUSSION.

CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION

THE COMPANY OPERATES IN

FOUR PRINCIPAL SEGMENTS: COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES, MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE

SYSTEMS, SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS, AND BCC. ALL OTHER ACTIVITIES FALL WITHIN THE

OTHER SEGMENT, PRINCIPALLY MADE UP OF BOEING TECHNOLOGY, CONNEXION BY

BOEING

LOWER REVENUES IN 2002 PRINCIPALLY REFLECT DECREASED DELIVERIES IN THE

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT. FEWER COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DELIVERIES IN 2002 WERE

OFFSET BY GROWTH OF $1.5 BILLION IN THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS

SEGMENT REVENUES. THE HIGHER REVENUES IN 2001 COMPARED TO 2000 PRINCIPALLY

REFLECT INCREASED DELIVERIES IN THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT, BUT ALSO

REFLECT AN INCREASE IN SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT REVENUES.

BASED ON CURRENT SCHEDULES

AND PLANS, THE COMPANY PROJECTS TOTAL 2003 REVENUES TO BE APPROXIMATELY

$49 BILLION.

OPERATING EARNINGS

OPERATING EARNINGS FOR 2002

WERE $3,868 MILLION COMPARED WITH $3,896 MILLION IN 2001 AND $3,058 MILLION IN

2000. 2001 OPERATING EARNINGS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACTED BY $935 MILLION OF

PRE-TAX SPECIAL CHARGES RELATED TO THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SEE NOTE 3.

EXCLUDING THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, SPECIAL CHARGES, OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2002

WOULD HAVE BEEN $963 MILLION LOWER THAN 2001 OPERATING EARNINGS. THIS DECREASE

IN OPERATING EARNINGS REFLECTED LOWER COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DELIVERIES OFFSET BY

PRODUCTION EFFICIENCIES IN THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT AND HIGHER

DELIVERIES OF MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT PRODUCTS. SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS ALSO DECREASED AS COMMERCIAL SATELLITE

LOSSES OFFSET GROWTH AND PERFORMANCE ON OTHER PROGRAMS. IN ADDITION, $426

MILLION OF ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES AND ADDITIONAL VALUATION RESERVES RELATED TO

CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING ASSETS WERE RECORDED BY BCC AND THE OTHER

SEGMENT DURING 2002.

OPERATING EARNINGS OF

$3,896 MILLION FOR 2001 WERE $838 MILLION HIGHER THAN 2000 OPERATING EARNINGS OF

$3,058 MILLION. EXCLUDING THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, PRE-TAX SPECIAL CHARGES OF

$935 MILLION, OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2001 WOULD HAVE BEEN $1,773 MILLION HIGHER

THAN 2000 OPERATING EARNINGS. THE INCREASE IN OPERATING EARNINGS DURING 2001 WAS

PRIMARILY RELATED TO HIGHER COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE DELIVERIES AND AN INCREASE IN

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS.

- 17 -

AS INDICATED IN NOTE 16,

THE COMPANY HAS GENERATED SIGNIFICANT NET PERIODIC BENEFIT INCOME RELATED TO

PENSIONS: $404 MILLION IN 2002, $920 MILLION IN 2001, AND $428 MILLION IN 2000.

NOT ALL NET PERIODIC PENSION BENEFIT INCOME OR EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED IN NET

EARNINGS IN THE YEAR INCURRED BECAUSE IT IS ALLOCATED TO PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT

COSTS, AND A PORTION REMAINS IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF A REPORTING PERIOD.

ACCORDINGLY, THE OPERATING EARNINGS FOR 2002, 2001 AND 2000, INCLUDED $537

MILLION, $785 MILLION AND $403 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, OF PENSION INCOME.

DUE TO THE SIGNIFICANT

INVESTMENT LOSSES INCURRED IN RECENT YEARS, THE EXPECTED FUTURE MARKET-RELATED

VALUE OF ASSETS IS EXPECTED TO DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THIS

DECREASE, WHEN COMBINED WITH THE DECREASE OF 25 BASIS POINTS IN THE EXPECTED

LONG-TERM ASSET RETURN IS EXPECTED TO REDUCE PENSION INCOME REFLECTED IN

OPERATING EARNINGS FROM $537 MILLION IN 2002 TO APPROXIMATELY $75 MILLION IN

2003. IN 2004, THE PENSION IMPACT TO EARNINGS WILL DEPEND ON MARKET CONDITIONS,

BUT BASED UPON CURRENT ASSUMPTIONS, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECOGNIZE A NON-CASH

PENSION EXPENSE ESTIMATED TO RANGE FROM $200 MILLION TO $300 MILLION.

NET EARNINGS

NET EARNINGS OF $492

MILLION FOR 2002 WERE $2,335 MILLION LOWER THAN 2001 EARNINGS OF $2,827 MILLION.

THE DECREASE IN NET EARNINGS PRINCIPALLY REFLECTED A $1,827 MILLION CHARGE

RECORDED IN 2002 UPON THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 142, DECREASED COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANE DELIVERIES, INCREASED CUSTOMER FINANCING CHARGES AND HIGHER COMMERCIAL

SATELLITE PRODUCTION COSTS. OTHER INCOME DECREASED $276 MILLION IN 2002, TO $42

MILLION IN 2002 FROM $318 MILLION IN 2001. OTHER INCOME IN 2001 INCLUDED $210

MILLION OF INTEREST INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH FEDERAL INCOME TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENTS;

2002 DID NOT INCLUDE SIMILAR INTEREST INCOME. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO LOWER OTHER

INCOME IN 2002 WAS $46 MILLION OF LOSSES ON LONG-HELD EQUITY INVESTMENTS.

INTEREST AND DEBT EXPENSE INCREASED $80 MILLION IN 2002, TO $730 MILLION IN 2002

FROM $650 MILLION IN 2001. THE INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTED FROM

INCREASED DEBT, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASED CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL

FINANCING ACTIVITIES OF BCC. INTEREST EXPENSE IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE CONCURRENT

WITH INCREASING FUTURE FINANCING ACTIVITY.

NET EARNINGS OF $2,827

MILLION FOR 2001 WERE $699 MILLION HIGHER THAN 2000 NET EARNINGS OF $2,128

MILLION. THE INCREASE IN NET EARNINGS PRINCIPALLY REFLECTED INCREASED OPERATING

EARNINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASE IN REVENUE FOR 2001. NET EARNINGS IN 2001

WERE SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED BY $935 MILLION OF PRE-TAX SPECIAL CHARGES ($633

MILLION AFTER TAX) RELATED TO THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. THE INCREASE IN

NET EARNINGS FOR 2001 OVER 2000 ALSO REFLECTED THE IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE OF $557 MILLION ($348 MILLION AFTER TAX) THAT WAS RECOGNIZED

IN 2000, OF WHICH $500 MILLION WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE ACQUISITION OF THE HUGHES

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES, WHICH WERE RENAMED BOEING SATELLITE

SYSTEMS. OTHER INCOME DECREASED $68 MILLION IN 2001, TO $318 MILLION IN 2001

FROM $386 MILLION IN 2000. THE DECREASE IN OTHER INCOME IN 2001 PRINCIPALLY

REFLECTED LOWER INTEREST INCOME FROM CASH, BUT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

INTEREST INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH FEDERAL INCOME TAX AUDIT SETTLEMENTS ($210

MILLION IN 2001, COMPARED WITH $73 MILLION IN 2000). OTHER INCOME IN 2000 ALSO

INCLUDED A $42 MILLION GAIN ON SALE OF A LONG-HELD EQUITY INVESTMENT. INTEREST

AND DEBT EXPENSE INCREASED $205 MILLION IN 2001, TO $650 MILLION IN 2001 FROM

$445 MILLION IN 2000. THE INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE RESULTED FROM INCREASED

DEBT, PRIMARILY ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCREASED CUSTOMER AND COMMERCIAL FINANCING

ACTIVITIES OF BCC.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES

INVOLVE DESIGN, DEVELOPMENT AND RELATED TEST ACTIVITIES FOR DEFENSE SYSTEMS, NEW

AND DERIVATIVE COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT, ADVANCE SPACE, OTHER COMPANY-SPONSORED

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT, AND BASIC RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. THESE EXPENDITURES ARE

EITHER CHARGED DIRECTLY AGAINST EARNINGS OR ARE INCLUDED IN AMOUNTS ALLOCABLE AS

REIMBURSABLE OVERHEAD COSTS ON U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT HIGHLIGHTS FOR EACH OF THE MAJOR BUSINESS SEGMENTS ARE DISCUSSED IN

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION. IN ADDITION, BOEING

TECHNOLOGY, THE ADVANCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ORGANIZATION OF THE COMPANY,

FOCUSES ON IMPROVING ITS COMPETITIVE POSITION BY INVESTING IN CERTAIN

TECHNOLOGIES AND PROCESSES THAT APPLY TO MULTIPLE BUSINESS UNITS. TECHNOLOGY

INVESTMENTS CURRENTLY BEING PURSUED WITHIN BOEING TECHNOLOGY INCLUDE NETWORK

CENTRIC OPERATIONS, AFFORDABLE STRUCTURES AND MANUFACTURING TECHNOLOGY, LEAN AND

EFFICIENT DESIGN PROCESSES AND TOOLS, LEAN SUPPORT AND SERVICE INITIATIVES,

ADVANCED PLATFORM SYSTEMS AND SAFE AND CLEAN PRODUCTS.

- 18 -

TOTAL RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN 2002 WAS $1,639 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $1,936 MILLION IN

2001 AND $1,998 MILLION IN 2000. EXCLUDING THE $557 MILLION OF IN-PROCESS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN 2000, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE

INCREASED $495 MILLION IN 2001, PRINCIPALLY REFLECTING INCREASES IN THE

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT AND THE OTHER SEGMENT, WHICH INCLUDES ACTIVITIES

RELATING TO CONNEXION BY BOEING

SM.

INCOME TAXES

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX

RATE FOR 2002 WAS 27.1% COMPARED WITH 20.7% IN 2001 AND 29.0% IN 2000. THE 2002

EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX RATE OF 27.1% VARIES FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY TAX RATE OF

35%, PRINCIPALLY DUE TO FOREIGN SALES CORPORATION (FSC) AND EXTRATERRITORIAL

INCOME (ETI) EXCLUSION TAX BENEFITS OF $195 MILLION. THIS RATE ALSO REFLECTS TAX

CREDITS, STATE INCOME TAXES AND FAVORABLE RESOLUTION OF CERTAIN AUDIT ISSUES.

THE EFFECTIVE INCOME TAX

RATES OF 20.7% FOR 2001 AND 29.0% FOR 2000 ALSO VARY FROM THE FEDERAL STATUTORY

TAX RATE PRINCIPALLY DUE TO FSC BENEFITS OF $222 MILLION IN 2001 AND $291

MILLION IN 2000. THE 2001 INCOME TAX RATE ALSO REFLECTS A ONE-TIME BENEFIT OF

$343 MILLION REFLECTING A SETTLEMENT WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS)

RELATING TO RESEARCH CREDIT CLAIMS ON MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION FIXED PRICE

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS APPLICABLE TO THE 1986-1992 FEDERAL INCOME TAX RETURNS.

IN DECEMBER 1996, THE

BOEING COMPANY FILED SUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF

WASHINGTON FOR THE REFUND OF OVER $400 MILLION IN FEDERAL INCOME TAXES AND

RELATED INTEREST. IF THE COMPANY WERE TO PREVAIL, THE REFUND OF THE AMOUNT IN

DISPUTE WOULD INCLUDE INTEREST COMPUTED TO THE PAYMENT DATE. HOWEVER, THE

COMPANY CANNOT PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A FAVORABLE OUTCOME. THE SUIT

CHALLENGED THE IRS METHOD OF ALLOCATING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THE

PURPOSE OF DETERMINING TAX INCENTIVE BENEFITS ON EXPORT SALES THROUGH THE

COMPANYS DOMESTIC INTERNATIONAL SALES CORPORATION (DISC) AND ITS FSC FOR

THE YEARS 1979 THROUGH 1987. THE COMPANY PREVAILED WITH THE DISTRICT COURT, BUT

LOST AN APPEALS DECISION WITH THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. THE COMPANY

APPEALED TO THE SUPREME COURT AND IS AWAITING THEIR DECISION, WHICH IS EXPECTED

IN THE FIRST HALF OF 2003. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL NOT BE

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED AS A RESULT OF THE SUITS OUTCOME.

BEGINNING IN 1999 AND

CONTINUING THROUGH 2002 THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU) HAS ISSUED A SERIES OF

OBJECTIONS WITH THE WORLD TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) TO BOTH U.S. FSC AND ETI

PROVISIONS. THE WTO HAS AGREED WITH THE EU AND RULED THAT THE FSC AND ETI

PROVISIONS CONSTITUTE PROHIBITED EXPORT SUBSIDIES. IN RESPONSE THE WTO HAS

AUTHORIZED THE EU TO IMPOSE RETALIATORY TARIFFS. A LIST OF PRODUCTS UPON WHICH

THE RETALIATORY TARIFF WOULD BE IMPOSED IS NOT YET FINAL, BUT AT THIS POINT NO

BOEING PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED ON THE LIST. PRESIDENT BUSH HAS STATED THAT

THE U.S. WILL BRING ITS TAX LAWS INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE WTO RULING THAT THE

EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME REGIME CONSTITUTES A PROHIBITED EXPORT SUBSIDY. BOTH THE

HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE AND THE SENATE FINANCE COMMITTEE ARE CONTINUING

TO ASSESS ALTERNATIVES FOR A REPLACEMENT OF THE ETI LEGISLATION. IT IS NOT

POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHAT IMPACT THIS ISSUE WILL HAVE ON FUTURE EARNINGS PENDING

FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS. IF ETI IS REPEALED AND REPLACEMENT

LEGISLATION IS NOT ENACTED, THE LOSS OF BENEFIT TO THE COMPANY COULD BE

SUBSTANTIAL.

INCOME TAXES HAVE BEEN

SETTLED WITH THE IRS FOR ALL YEARS THROUGH 1978, AND IRS EXAMINATIONS HAVE BEEN

COMPLETED THROUGH 1991. IN CONNECTION WITH THESE EXAMINATIONS, THE COMPANY

DISAGREES WITH IRS PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS, AND THE YEARS 1979 THROUGH 1987 ARE IN

LITIGATION. THE IRS EXAMINATION FOR MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION FOR THE YEARS

1993 THROUGH 1995 HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE COMPANY RECEIVED A REFUND OF $102

MILLION IN 2002. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR ALL OUTSTANDING

ISSUES HAS BEEN MADE FOR ALL OPEN YEARS.

BACKLOG

CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG OF

UNFILLED ORDERS EXCLUDES PURCHASE OPTIONS, ANNOUNCED ORDERS FOR WHICH DEFINITIVE

CONTRACTS HAVE NOT BEEN EXECUTED, AND UNOBLIGATED U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT

CONTRACT FUNDING. TOTAL CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG BALANCES WERE $104.2 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2002, $106.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001, AND $120.6 BILLION AT

DECEMBER 31, 2000. THE DECREASES IN CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG FROM 2001 TO 2002 AND

2000 TO 2001 WERE RELATED TO DECREASES IN CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG FOR COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANES OFFSET BY INCREASES IN CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG FOR BOTH SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS AND MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS.

UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG

INCLUDES U.S. AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT DEFINITIVE CONTRACTS FOR WHICH FUNDING HAS

NOT BEEN APPROPRIATED. UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG TOTALED $34.7 BILLION, $27.5 BILLION

AND $31.3 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE

INCREASE IN UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG FROM 2001 TO 2002 IS PRIMARILY RELATED TO

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS. OVERALL, UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG DECREASED FROM 2000 TO 2001 DUE TO

A DECREASE IN UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS,

WHICH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY AN INCREASE IN UNOBLIGATED BACKLOG FOR SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS.

LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES

THE PRIMARY FACTORS THAT AFFECT THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT REQUIREMENTS AND LIQUIDITY POSITION, OTHER

THAN OPERATING RESULTS ASSOCIATED WITH CURRENT SALES ACTIVITY, INCLUDE THE

FOLLOWING: TIMING OF NEW AND DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS REQUIRING BOTH HIGH

DEVELOPMENTAL EXPENDITURES AND INITIAL INVENTORY BUILDUP; CYCLICAL FACTORS,

INCLUDING GROWTH AND EXPANSION REQUIREMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH

REDUCING SALES LEVELS; CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSISTANCE; THE TIMING OF FEDERAL

INCOME TAX PAYMENTS; THE COMPANYS STOCK REPURCHASE PLAN; AND POTENTIAL

ACQUISITIONS.

CASH FLOW SUMMARY

THE COMPANY HAS GENERATED

STRONG CASH FLOW FROM OPERATING ACTIVITIES WITH $4.4 BILLION PROVIDED IN 2002,

$3.9 BILLION IN 2001 AND $6.2 BILLION IN 2000. EARNINGS, ADJUSTED FOR NON-CASH

ITEMS, CONTINUE TO BE THE PRIMARY SOURCE OF OPERATING CASH FLOW WITH OVER $4

BILLION PROVIDED IN EACH OF THE LAST THREE YEARS.

WORKING CAPITAL FROM

OPERATIONS EXCLUDING CASH CONTRIBUTIONS FOR PENSIONS GENERATED APPROXIMATELY

$0.5 BILLION OF NET CASH IN 2002. DUE TO THE DECLINE IN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY,

LOWER INVENTORY BALANCES AND PRODUCTION RATES RESULTED IN A $1.5 BILLION

INCREASE IN CASH FLOW. THE AMOUNT OF CUSTOMER ADVANCE PAYMENTS RECEIVED IN

EXCESS OF COSTS WAS $0.9 BILLION LESS IN 2002 THAN THE PREVIOUS YEAR DUE

PRIMARILY TO LOWER ADVANCE PAYMENTS RECEIVED. THERE WAS ALSO A SUBSTANTIAL

REDUCTION IN VENDOR PAYABLES. THE REDUCTION IN TAX PAYMENTS IN 2002 RESULTED

PRINCIPALLY FROM LOWER EARNINGS AND A $0.1 BILLION TAX REFUND FROM SETTLEMENTS

OF SEVERAL TAX AUDITS.

THE WORKING CAPITAL TREND

AS REFLECTED IN THE FIVE-YEAR SUMMARY INDICATES THAT THE COMPANY HAS BEEN ABLE

TO USE LOWER AMOUNTS OF WORKING CAPITAL TO SUPPORT THE VOLUME OF BUSINESS

TRANSACTED AND IS USING CAPITAL MORE EFFICIENTLY. THIS TREND DOES NOT REFLECT A

CHANGE IN THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MEET OBLIGATIONS.

PENSIONS

2002 OPERATING CASH FLOW

INCLUDED $0.3 BILLION OF CASH FUNDING TO THE PENSION PLANS. ON APRIL 15, 2002,

THE COMPANY VOLUNTARILY FUNDED THREE OF ITS DEFINED BENEFIT PLANS TO ENSURE THAT

EACH OF ITS PLANS WOULD HAVE ASSETS THAT WERE AT LEAST APPROXIMATELY EQUAL TO

(AND IN MOST CASES GREATER THAN) THE LIABILITY FOR VESTED BENEFITS AS MEASURED

BY THE PENSION BENEFIT GUARANTY CORPORATION. THE COMPANY DOES NOT EXPECT

SIGNIFICANT PENSION FUNDING REQUIREMENTS IN 2003, ALTHOUGH IT MAY MAKE

ADDITIONAL DISCRETIONARY CONTRIBUTIONS.

THE COMPANY MEASURES ITS

PENSION PLAN USING A SEPTEMBER 30 YEAR-END FOR FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING PURPOSES.

THE SIGNIFICANT DECLINES EXPERIENCED IN THE FINANCIAL MARKETS HAVE UNFAVORABLY

IMPACTED ASSET PERFORMANCE. AS A RESULT, THE COMPANY HAS REDUCED ITS EXPECTED

LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN BY 25 BASIS POINTS TO 9.0% BEGINNING IN 2003. THE

EXPECTED LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN IS BASED ON TARGET ASSET ALLOCATIONS OF

60% EQUITY WITH A RETURN OF 10.0%, 30% FIXED INCOME WITH A RETURN OF 6.8%, AND

10% OTHER (INCLUDING REAL ESTATE) WITH A RETURN OF 9.2%. CURRENT ALLOCATIONS ARE

WITHIN 1 TO 3% OF EACH OF THE LONG-TERM TARGETS. THE DECLINE IN ASSET

PERFORMANCE COUPLED WITH HISTORICALLY LOW INTEREST RATES (A KEY FACTOR WHEN

ESTIMATING PLAN LIABILITIES), CAUSED THE COMPANY TO RECOGNIZE A SIGNIFICANT

NON-CASH CHARGE TO EQUITY IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002. THIS CHARGE, WHICH

AMOUNTED TO A $5.7 BILLION INCREASE TO THE ACCRUED PENSION PLAN LIABILITY AND A

$3.6 BILLION AFTER TAX DECREASE TO THE ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

ACCOUNT WITHIN SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY, DID NOT IMPACT EARNINGS OR CASH FLOW,

AND COULD REVERSE IN FUTURE PERIODS SHOULD EITHER INTEREST RATES INCREASE OR

MARKET PERFORMANCE AND PLAN RETURNS IMPROVE. THE COMPANY USES A DISCOUNT RATE

THAT IS BASED ON A POINT-IN-TIME ESTIMATE AS OF THE SEPTEMBER 30 MEASUREMENT

DATE. ALTHOUGH FUTURE CHANGES TO THE DISCOUNT RATE ARE UNKNOWN, HAD THE DISCOUNT

RATE INCREASED OR DECREASED 100 BASIS POINTS, THE PENSION AND POSTRETIREMENT

LIABILITY WOULD HAVE DECREASED $3.6 BILLION OR INCREASED $4.4 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

INVESTING ACTIVITIES

THE MAJORITY OF BCCS

CUSTOMER FINANCING IS FUNDED BY DEBT AND CASH FLOW FROM ITS OWN OPERATIONS. AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAD OUTSTANDING IRREVOCABLE COMMITMENTS OF

APPROXIMATELY $3.2 BILLION TO ARRANGE OR PROVIDE FINANCING RELATED TO AIRCRAFT

ON ORDER OR UNDER OPTION FOR DELIVERIES SCHEDULED THROUGH THE YEAR 2007. NOT ALL

THESE COMMITMENTS ARE LIKELY TO BE USED; HOWEVER, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE

COMMITMENTS ARE WITH PARTIES WITH RELATIVELY LOW CREDIT RATINGS. SEE NOTE 20 AND

21. OUTSTANDING LOANS AND COMMITMENTS ARE PRIMARILY SECURED BY THE UNDERLYING

AIRCRAFT.

ADDITIONAL INVESTMENTS OF

$0.4 BILLION WERE MADE BY BCC IN ENHANCED EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES (EETCS)

OFFERED BY VARIOUS AIRLINES IN 2002. EETCS ARE WIDELY USED IN THE AIRLINE

INDUSTRY AS A METHOD OF FINANCING AIRCRAFT. BCC PROVIDES FINANCING FOR AIRLINES

AND HAS BEGUN INVESTING IN THESE TYPES OF INSTRUMENTS AS AN INVESTOR. SEE BCC

SEGMENT RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FINANCING ACTIVITIES

DEBT MATURITIES DURING THIS

THREE-YEAR PERIOD INCLUDED $1.3 BILLION IN 2002, $0.5 BILLION IN 2001, AND $0.5

BILLION IN 2000. ADDITIONALLY, BCC ISSUED $2.8 BILLION OF DEBT IN 2002, $3.9

BILLION IN 2001 AND $2.0 BILLION IN 2000. THE SIGNIFICANT BCC DEBT ISSUANCE IN

2000 AND 2001 WAS PERFORMED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE TRANSFER OF A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF THE COMPANYS CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSETS TO BCC AS WELL AS GROWTH

IN THE CUSTOMER FINANCING PORTFOLIO. IN 2002, BCC DEBT ISSUANCE WAS GENERALLY

USED FOR GROWTH IN THE CUSTOMER FINANCING PORTFOLIO. THE COMPANY HAS A SHARE

REPURCHASE PROGRAM, BUT THERE WERE NO SHARE REPURCHASES IN 2002. SEE NOTE 18.

INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTACTS

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED

INTO CERTAIN SIGNIFICANT INVENTORY PROCUREMENT CONTRACTS THAT

SPECIFY DETERMINABLE PRICES AND QUANTITIES, AND LONG-TERM DELIVERY

TIMEFRAMES. THESE AGREEMENTS REQUIRE SUPPLIERS AND VENDORS TO BE PREPARED

TO BUILD AND DELIVER ITEMS IN SUFFICIENT TIME TO MEET THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTION SCHEDULES. THE NEED FOR SUCH ARRANGEMENTS WITH SUPPLIERS AND

VENDORS ARISES DUE TO THE EXTENDED PRODUCTION PLANNING HORIZON FOR MANY OF ITS

PRODUCTS, INCLUDING COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT, MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND OTHER PRODUCTS

WHERE THE DELIVERY TO THE CUSTOMER IS OVER AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF THESE INVENTORY COMMITMENTS ARE EITHER SUPPORTED BY A

FIRM CONTRACT FROM A CUSTOMER OR HAVE HISTORICALLY RESULTED IN SETTLEMENT

THROUGH EITHER TERMINATION PAYMENTS OR CONTRACT ADJUSTMENTS, WHEN NECESSARY,

SHOULD THE CUSTOMER BASE NOT MATERIALIZE TO SUPPORT DELIVERY FROM THE SUPPLIER.

ALTHOUGH THERE ARE NO PLANS TO DO SO, IF ANY OF THE COMPANYS PROGRAMS WERE

TO BE TERMINATED, THE COMPANY WOULD BE EXPOSED TO POTENTIALLY MATERIAL

TERMINATION COSTS.

INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED

INTO VARIOUS INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS IN FOREIGN

COUNTRIES TO EFFECT ECONOMIC FLOW BACK AND/OR TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER TO THEIR

BUSINESSES OR GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AS THE RESULT OF THEIR PROCUREMENT OF GOODS

AND/OR SERVICES FROM THE COMPANY. THESE COMMITMENTS MAY BE SATISFIED BY THE

COMPANYS PLACEMENT OF DIRECT WORK, PLACEMENT OF VENDOR ORDERS FOR

SUPPLIES, OPPORTUNITIES TO BID ON SUPPLY CONTRACTS, TRANSFER OF TECHNOLOGY, OR

OTHER FORMS OF ASSISTANCE TO THE FOREIGN COUNTRY. THE COMPANY DOES NOT COMMIT TO

INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION OBLIGATIONS UNLESS A CONTRACT FOR SALE OF THE

COMPANYS PRODUCTS OR SERVICES IS SIGNED. TO BE ELIGIBLE FOR SUCH A

COMMITMENT FROM THE COMPANY, THE FOREIGN COUNTRY OR CUSTOMER MUST HAVE

SUFFICIENT CAPABILITY AND CAPACITY AND MUST BE COMPETITIVE IN COST, QUALITY AND

SCHEDULE. IN CERTAIN CASES, IF A CONTRACT IS PLACED WITH A FOREIGN SUPPLIER TO

SATISFY AN INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION OBLIGATION, FAILURE OF THAT SUPPLIER TO

COMPLY WITH ANY OR ALL OF THESE TERMS AND CONDITIONS RELIEVES THE COMPANY OF ITS

OBLIGATIONS PURSUANT TO THAT PORTION OF ITS INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION COMMITMENT.

IN CERTAIN CASES, PENALTIES COULD BE IMPOSED IF THE COMPANY DOES NOT MEET ITS

INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION OBLIGATIONS. DURING 2002, NO PENALTIES WERE INCURRED BY

THE COMPANY. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY HAS OUTSTANDING INDUSTRIAL

PARTICIPATION OBLIGATIONS TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $8.2 BILLION THAT EXTEND

THROUGH 2013.

CAPITAL RESOURCES

THE COMPANY HAS THE FOLLOWING STANDARD & POOR'S CREDIT RATINGS: SHORT-TERM, A-1; SENIOR DEBT, A+. BCC HAS THE

FOLLOWING STANDARD & POOR'S CREDIT RATINGS:  SHORT-TERM, A-1; SENIOR DEBT,  A+. THE COMPANY HAS THE FOLLOWING

MOODY'S CREDIT RATINGS: SHORT-TERM, P-1; SENIOR DEBT, A2. BCC HAS THE FOLLOWING MOODY'S CREDIT RATINGS.

SHORT-TERM, P-2; SENIOR DEBT, A3. THE COMPANY HAS THE FOLLOWING FITCH'S CREDIT RATINGS:  SHORT-TERM, F-1; SENIOR

DEBT, A+. BCC HAS THE FOLLOWING FITCH'S CREDIT RATINGS:  SHORT-TERM, F-1; SENIOR DEBT, A+.

THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11,

2001, NEGATIVELY IMPACTED THE LIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES OF THE COMPANY.

SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE COMPANY ESTABLISHED A COMMERCIAL PAPER

PROGRAM PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SHORT-TERM LIQUIDITY. COMMERCIAL PAPER REMAINS A

SIGNIFICANT LIQUIDITY SOURCE.

- 22 -

THE COMPANY HAS DEBT

OBLIGATIONS OF $14.4 BILLION, WHICH ARE UNSECURED. APPROXIMATELY $1.8 BILLION

WILL MATURE IN 2003, AND THE BALANCE HAS AN AVERAGE MATURITY OF 12.4 YEARS.

EXCLUDING BCC DEBT OF $9.5 BILLION AND NON-RECOURSE DEBT OF $0.6 BILLION, TOTAL

DEBT IS AT 42% OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY PLUS DEBT. THE CONSOLIDATED

DEBT, INCLUDING BCC, IS AT 65% OF TOTAL SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY PLUS DEBT. AS

PREVIOUSLY NOTED, THE COMPANY HAS RECOGNIZED A SIGNIFICANT NON-CASH CHARGE TO

EQUITY OF $3.6 BILLION, NET OF TAX. EXCLUDING THIS ITEM AND BCC DEBT, THE

CONSOLIDATED DEBT WAS 31% OF SHAREHOLDERS EQUITY PLUS DEBT.

THE COMPANY HAS ADDITIONAL

SUBSTANTIAL BORROWING CAPABILITY. CURRENTLY, THE COMPANY HAS $4.3 BILLION THAT

REMAINS AVAILABLE FROM SHELF REGISTRATIONS FILED WITH THE SECURITIES AND

EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) AND $4.5 BILLION ($2.0 BILLION EXCLUSIVELY AVAILABLE

FOR BCC) OF UNUSED BORROWING ON REVOLVING CREDIT LINE AGREEMENTS WITH A GROUP OF

MAJOR BANKS. SEE NOTE 15. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ITS INTERNALLY GENERATED

LIQUIDITY, TOGETHER WITH ACCESS TO EXTERNAL CAPITAL RESOURCES, WILL BE

SUFFICIENT TO SATISFY EXISTING COMMITMENTS AND PLANS, AND ALSO TO PROVIDE

ADEQUATE FINANCIAL FLEXIBILITY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF POTENTIAL STRATEGIC BUSINESS

OPPORTUNITIES SHOULD THEY ARISE WITHIN THE NEXT YEAR.

DUE TO THE CONTINUING

DOWNTURN IN THE COMMERCIAL AVIATION MARKET AND THE RECENT AIRLINE ANNOUNCEMENTS

IN THE UNITED STATES THAT CONFIRM THE DELAYED RECOVERY OF AIRLINE TRAFFIC AND

PROFITABILITY, SEVERAL CUSTOMERS HAVE RESCHEDULED AIRCRAFT DELIVERY DATES. THE

RESCHEDULING OF DELIVERY DATES WILL REDUCE AIRCRAFT ADVANCE PAYMENTS IN THE NEAR

TERM. THE REDUCTION IN ADVANCE PAYMENTS WILL BE OFFSET BY REDUCED INVENTORY

SPENDING, RESULTING IN AN IMMATERIAL IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS LIQUIDITY.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS

THE COMPANY IS A PARTY TO

CERTAIN OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS, AS DEFINED BY THE SEC, INCLUDING CERTAIN

GUARANTEES AND VARIABLE INTERESTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES.

GUARANTEES

THE FOLLOWING TABLES

PROVIDE QUANTITATIVE DATA REGARDING THE COMPANYS THIRD-PARTY GUARANTEES.

*AMOUNTS INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES

THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED

VARIOUS ASSET-RELATED GUARANTEES, PRINCIPALLY TO FACILITATE THE SALE OF CERTAIN

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO MAKE

PAYMENTS TO A GUARANTEED PARTY IN THE EVENT THE RELATED AIRCRAFT FAIR VALUES

FALL BELOW A SPECIFIED AMOUNT AT A FUTURE POINT IN TIME. THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE

COLLATERALIZED PRINCIPALLY BY COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. NO AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN

DELIVERED WITH THESE TYPES OF GUARANTEES IN SEVERAL YEARS. RECENT DECLINES IN

ASSET VALUES OF COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT INCREASE THE RISK OF FUTURE PAYMENT BY THE

COMPANY UNDER THESE GUARANTEES.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002,

THE COMPANY RECORDED A REDUCTION TO EXPENSE OF $3 MILLION AND MADE NET CASH

PAYMENTS TOTALING $138 MILLION RELATED TO ITS ASSET-RELATED GUARANTEES.

- 23 -

THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED

CREDIT GUARANTEES TO CREDITORS OF THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE, OF WHICH THE COMPANY

IS A 40% OWNER, TO ASSIST THE VENTURE IN OBTAINING FINANCING. IN THE EVENT THE

COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO PERFORM ON THESE GUARANTEES, IT HAS THE RIGHT TO RECOVER

A PORTION OF THE LOSS FROM ANOTHER VENTURE PARTNER, AND HAS COLLATERAL RIGHTS TO

CERTAIN ASSETS OF THE VENTURE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED CREDIT

GUARANTEES, PRINCIPALLY TO FACILITATE THE SALE OF CERTAIN COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.

UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO A

GUARANTEED PARTY IN THE EVENT THAT LEASE OR LOAN PAYMENTS ARE NOT MADE BY THE

ORIGINAL DEBTOR OR LESSEE. THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CREDIT-RELATED

GUARANTEES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY THE UNDERLYING COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THESE GUARANTEES HAVE BEEN EXTENDED ON BEHALF OF ORIGINAL

DEBTORS OR LESSEES WITH LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. RECENT FINANCIAL

WEAKNESS IN CERTAIN AIRLINES FURTHER EXPOSES THE COMPANY TO LOSS UNDER ITS

CREDIT GUARANTEES. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED

NO EXPENSES AND MADE NET CASH PAYMENTS TOTALING $9 MILLION RELATED TO ITS CREDIT

GUARANTEES.

AS A LIQUIDITY PROVIDER FOR

EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATE (ETC) PASS-THROUGH ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS

CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS TO INVESTORS IN THE TRUSTS, WHICH REQUIRES FUNDING TO THE

TRUST TO COVER INTEREST DUE TO SUCH INVESTORS RESULTING FROM AN EVENT OF DEFAULT

BY UNITED AIRLINES. IN THE EVENT OF FUNDING, THE COMPANY RECEIVES A FIRST

PRIORITY POSITION IN THE ETC COLLATERAL IN THE AMOUNT OF THE FUNDING. ON

FEBRUARY 7, 2003, THE COMPANY ADVANCED $101 MILLION TO THE TRUST PERFECTING ITS

COLLATERAL POSITION AND TERMINATING ITS LIQUIDITY OBLIGATION. THE TRUST

CURRENTLY HAS COLLATERAL VALUE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS THE AMOUNT DUE TO THE

COMPANY.

ALSO RELATING TO AN ETC

INVESTMENT, THE COMPANY HAS POTENTIAL OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO SHORTFALL INTEREST

PAYMENTS IN THE EVENT THAT THE INTEREST RATES IN THE UNDERLYING AGREEMENTS ARE

RESET BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL. THESE OBLIGATIONS WOULD CEASE IF UNITED AIRLINES

WERE TO DEFAULT ON ITS INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE TRUST. THERE WERE NO SIGNIFICANT

PAYMENTS MADE BY THE COMPANY DURING 2002.

THE COMPANY HAS OUTSTANDING

PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS.

PURSUANT TO THESE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS IN

THE EVENT A THIRD-PARTY FAILS TO PERFORM SPECIFIED SERVICES.

MATERIAL VARIABLE INTERESTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

ASSESSING THE APPLICATION OF FIN 46 AS IT RELATES TO ITS VARIABLE INTERESTS.

WHILE THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE FULL AMOUNT OF

THE ETCS, EETCS OR THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE IN WHICH IT HAS INVESTED, IT IS UNABLE

TO DEFINITIVELY CONCLUDE AT THIS TIME WHETHER CONSOLIDATION OR DISCLOSURE WILL

BE REQUIRED FOR THESE INVESTMENTS UPON FULL ADOPTION OF FIN 46. THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN ETCS AND EETCS AGGREGATED $455 MILLION AT DECEMBER

31, 2002. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED REVENUES

OF $25 MILLION, CASH INFLOWS OF $41 MILLION, AND IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE OF $79

MILLION RELATING TO THESE INVESTMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE VIE (ETCS

AND EETCS) IN WHICH THE COMPANY HAS INVESTED HAVE TOTAL ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY

$4.2 BILLION AND TOTAL DEBT (WHICH IS NON-RECOURSE TO THE COMPANY) OF

APPROXIMATELY $3.7 BILLION. THE TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL LIABILITIES OF THE SEA

LAUNCH VENTURE EACH REPRESENT LESS THAN 4% OF THE COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED

TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. THE COMPANY MADE NO

ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE DURING THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2002.

RELATED TO THE ISSUANCE OF

CERTAIN STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AND SURETY BONDS INCLUDED IN THE ABOVE TABLE,

THE COMPANY RECEIVED $608 MILLION OF ADVANCE PAYMENTS FROM CUSTOMERS.

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

CERTAIN TRADE-IN AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE USED AIRCRAFT FROM CUSTOMERS AT A

SPECIFIC PRICE AT A FUTURE POINT IN TIME WHEN THOSE CUSTOMERS PURCHASE NEW

AIRCRAFT FROM THE COMPANY. IN THE EVENT THE COMPANY ACCEPTS AN AIRCRAFT UNDER A

TRADE-IN AGREEMENT, THE AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY SERVES AS COLLATERAL

TO OFFSET AMOUNTS PAID BY THE COMPANY TO THE CUSTOMER. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDED $156 MILLION RELATED TO TRADE-IN

COMMITMENTS, OF WHICH $93 MILLION WAS RELATED TO THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11,

2001. THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN VALUE OF ALL AIRCRAFT THAT CUSTOMERS HAD

THE RIGHT TO SELL TO THE COMPANY WAS $1,993 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, AND

THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE AIRCRAFT WAS $1,837 MILLION. THERE

IS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF

TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS. GENERALLY, AS COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT VALUES DECLINE, THE

PROBABILITY OF THE COMPANYS PERFORMANCE ON TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS INCREASES.

THERE HAVE BEEN RECENT DECLINES IN VALUE FOR CERTAIN AIRCRAFT MODELS, INCLUDING

THOSE FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS TRADE-IN AGREEMENTS. UPDATES ON THE LIKELIHOOD

THAT TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WILL BE EXERCISED USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION

FROM VALUATION SOURCES AND QUALITATIVE INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES ARE

CONTINUALLY ASSESSED. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO MONITOR ALL TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS

FOR ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS.

OTHER COMMERCIAL

COMMITMENTS INCLUDE IRREVOCABLE FINANCING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON

ORDER AND COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT FINANCING. THESE ARE PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED AND

ALSO DISCLOSED IN NOTE 20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RIGHTS TO CANCEL WITHOUT PENALTY HAVE EXPIRED. TYPICAL CUSTOMER RIGHTS TO CANCEL

WITHOUT PENALTY INCLUDE RECEIVING BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVAL, SHAREHOLDER

APPROVAL, GOVERNMENT APPROVAL AND COMPLETING FINANCING ARRANGEMENTS. ALL SUCH

CANCELLATION RIGHTS MUST BE SATISFIED OR EXPIRED EVEN IF SATISFYING SUCH

CONDITIONS ARE HIGHLY CERTAIN. FIRM ORDERS EXCLUDE OPTION AIRCRAFT AND AIRCRAFT

SUBJECT TO RECONFIRMATION.

TOTAL COMMERCIAL JET

AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES FOR 2003 ARE CURRENTLY PROJECTED TO APPROXIMATE 280

AIRCRAFT. FOR 2004, COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES ARE CURRENTLY PROJECTED TO BE

IN THE RANGE OF 275 TO 300 AIRCRAFT. AS OF JANUARY 30, 2003, THE DELIVERY

FORECAST FOR 2003 IS VIRTUALLY SOLD OUT AND APPROXIMATELY 80% SOLD FOR 2004 AT

THE LOWER END OF THE RANGE. COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT REVENUES FOR 2003 ARE

PROJECTED TO BE IN THE RANGE OF $22 BILLION.

OPERATING EARNINGS

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

SEGMENT CALCULATES ITS OPERATING EARNINGS USING BOTH THE UNIT COST AND PROGRAM

ACCOUNTING METHODS. FOR SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES, AS DISCLOSED IN NOTE 24, THE

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES OPERATING EARNINGS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000,

ARE PROVIDED ON THE UNIT COST BASIS. BEGINNING IN FIRST QUARTER 2003, COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANES SEGMENT DATA WILL BE BASED ON THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING METHOD.

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

SEGMENT 2002 OPERATING EARNINGS, BASED ON THE UNIT COST OF AIRPLANES DELIVERED,

WERE $2,847 MILLION, COMPARED WITH $2,632 MILLION IN 2001 AND $2,736 MILLION IN

2000. THE RELATED OPERATING MARGINS WERE 10.0%, 7.5% AND 8.8%, RESPECTIVELY.

2002 AND 2001 OPERATING EARNINGS INCLUDED $(2) MILLION AND $908 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF (RECOVERIES)/CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001,

TERRORIST ATTACKS. EXCLUDING THESE (RECOVERIES)/CHARGES, COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS IN 2002 AND 2001 WERE $2,845 MILLION AND $3,540

MILLION, RESULTING IN OPERATING MARGINS OF 10.0% AND 10.1%, RESPECTIVELY.

EXCLUDING THE SEPTEMBER 11 (RECOVERIES)/CHARGES, 2002 OPERATING MARGIN WAS

SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN 2001 DUE TO THE DECLINE IN REVENUE OFFSET BY IMPROVED

OPERATING EFFICIENCY AND REDUCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. 2001

OPERATING EARNINGS AND MARGIN, EXCLUDING SEPTEMBER 11 CHARGES, INCREASED FROM

2000 PRINCIPALLY DUE TO INCREASED REVENUE AND CONTINUED IMPROVEMENT IN THE

PRODUCTION PROCESS.

- 26 -

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS, BASED ON THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING AND

INCLUDING INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS, AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 24, WERE $2,017

MILLION, $1,911 MILLION AND $2,099 MILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND

2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE RELATED OPERATING MARGINS WERE 7.1%, 5.5%, AND 6.7%.

EXCLUDING THE 2002 AND 2001 (RECOVERIES)/CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH SEPTEMBER 11,

2001, THE OPERATING EARNINGS FOR THESE PERIODS WERE $2,015 MILLION AND $2,819

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPARABLE MARGINS WERE 7.1% AND 8.0%. THE DECLINE IN

MARGINS FROM 2001 TO 2002 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN REVENUE OFFSET BY

IMPROVED OPERATING EFFICIENCY AND REDUCED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE. IN

ADDITION, THE MARGINS HAVE BEEN ADVERSELY IMPACTED COMPARED TO 2001 DUE TO THE

AIRCRAFT MARKET DECLINE. IN GENERAL, THIS HAS RESULTED IN THE LENGTHENING OF THE

TIME NEEDED TO PRODUCE THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

PRODUCTION COSTS INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS, A PORTION

OF WHICH DO NOT VARY WITH PRODUCTION RATES. AS THE AMOUNT OF TIME NEEDED TO

PRODUCE THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY INCREASES, THE AVERAGE COST OF THE ACCOUNTING

QUANTITY ALSO INCREASES AS THESE INFRASTRUCTURE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN THE TOTAL

COST ESTIMATES, THUS REDUCING THE GROSS MARGIN AND RELATED EARNINGS PROVIDED

OTHER FACTORS DO NOT CHANGE.

THE FAVORABLE COST

PERFORMANCE REFLECTED IN THE CURRENT YEAR EARNINGS AND MARGIN IS RECOGNIZED OVER

CURRENT AND FUTURE DELIVERIES UNDER THE PROGRAM METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. FOR

SEGMENT REPORTING PURPOSES, THE FAVORABLE COST PERFORMANCE IS A CUMULATIVE

ADJUSTMENT TO UNIT COST OVER CURRENT AND PRIOR DELIVERIES.

THE COMPANY WILL CONTINUE

TO EXPERIENCE A HIGHER THAN NORMAL QUANTITY OF USED AIRPLANES THROUGH 2003 AS A

RESULT OF COMMITMENTS ENTERED INTO THROUGH PURCHASE AGREEMENTS WITH CUSTOMERS

FOR NEW AIRCRAFT AND SERVICES. DUE TO THE CURRENT MARKET FOR USED AIRPLANES, THE

COMPANYS USED AIRPLANE INVENTORY MAY INCREASE AND THESE PURCHASES AND

COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE MAY RESULT IN FUTURE CHARGES.

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY

A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE

ESTIMATED ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH AIRCRAFT TO BE PRODUCED FOR DELIVERY

UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY HAS A POLICY THAT

DETERMINES THE APPROPRIATE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR EACH COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

PROGRAM. THIS POLICY TAKES INTO ACCOUNT SEVERAL FACTORS INFLUENCED BY THE DEMAND

FOR THE PARTICULAR PRODUCT. THE COMPANY REVIEWS AND REASSESSES ITS PROGRAM

ACCOUNTING QUANTITIES ON A QUARTERLY BASIS IN COMPLIANCE WITH RELEVANT PROGRAM

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE.

THE CURRENT MARKET FOR

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS ADVERSELY AFFECTING ALL OF COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS. THE RESULTING REDUCTION IN PRODUCTION RATES IS

EXTENDING THE TIME FRAME FOR PRODUCTION AND DELIVERY OF THE ACCOUNTING

QUANTITIES USED FOR PROGRAM ACCOUNTING. THIS IS PARTICULARLY TRUE FOR THE 747,

757 AND 767 PROGRAMS. THE 757 AND 767 PROGRAMS HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING THE MOST

DIFFICULTY ACQUIRING NEW ORDERS. CURRENT MARKET PROJECTIONS INDICATE THAT THE

COMPANY WILL BE SUCCESSFUL IN SELLING THE UNSOLD UNITS WITHIN THE CURRENT

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR ALL PROGRAMS, THEREFORE NO ACCOUNTING QUANTITIES HAVE

BEEN REDUCED.

THE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY FOR

THE 717 PROGRAM CONTINUES TO BE BASED ON FIRM ORDERS AS IT HAS BEEN SINCE FOURTH

QUARTER OF 2001. THE INCREASE OF FIVE UNITS IN THE 717 PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

QUANTITY DURING THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2002 WAS THE RESULT OF NET NEW ORDER

ACTIVITY ON THE PROGRAM. THE REDUCTION OF 65 UNITS IN THE 717 PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

QUANTITY DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001 WAS DRIVEN BY A LACK OF FIRM DEMAND

FOR THE 717 AIRCRAFT SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. SEE NOTE 3. THIS DECREASE

IN DEMAND IS DEMONSTRATED IN THE TABLE BELOW BY THE SHARP DECREASE IN THE 717

PROGRAMS ANTICIPATED ORDERS AS A PERCENTAGE OF CUMULATIVE FIRM ORDERS

BETWEEN DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND DECEMBER 31, 2000. PROGRAM ACCOUNTING QUANTITY

INCREASES BETWEEN DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND DECEMBER 31, 2000 ON OTHER PROGRAMS WERE

THE RESULT OF THE NORMAL PROGRESSION OF BUSINESS; DELIVERING AIRCRAFT; AND

OBTAINING ADDITIONAL ORDERS.

INCLUDE ORDERS THAT FALL WITHIN THE CURRENT ACCOUNTING QUANTITIES AS WELL AS

ORDERS THAT EXTEND BEYOND THE CURRENT ACCOUNTING QUANTITIES. CUMULATIVE FIRM

ORDERS EXCLUDE PROGRAM TEST AIRCRAFT THAT WILL NOT BE REFURBISHED FOR SALE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

THE COMPANY HAD CUMULATIVELY DELIVERED 113 717 PROGRAM AIRCRAFT. THE COMPANY

WILL RECORD 717 DELIVERIES ON A BREAK-EVEN BASIS UNTIL SUCH TIME AS PROGRAM

REVIEWS INDICATE CHANGES TO THE GROSS MARGIN. THE COMPANY HAS POTENTIALLY

MATERIAL EXPOSURES RELATED TO THE 717 PROGRAM, PRINCIPALLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO

TERMINATION COSTS THAT COULD RESULT FROM A LACK OF LONGER-TERM MARKET

ACCEPTANCE.

THE COMPANY IS ANTICIPATING

AN ORDER FROM THE U.S. AIR FORCE FOR 100 767 TANKERS, WHICH WILL HAVE A

LONG-TERM POSITIVE IMPACT ON THE 767 PROGRAM. THIS ORDER HAS BEEN INCORPORATED

INTO THE PROGRAM ESTIMATES TO THE EXTENT THE AIRCRAFT FALL WITHIN THE CURRENT

ACCOUNTING QUANTITY. BASED ON THE ANTICIPATED DELIVERY SCHEDULE AND FORECASTED

PRODUCTION RATES MOST OF THESE AIRCRAFT FALL BEYOND THE CURRENT ACCOUNTING

QUANTITY. THE ORDER FROM THE U.S. AIR FORCE FOR 100 767 TANKERS IS ANTICIPATED

TO BECOME A FIRM CONTRACT DURING 2003.

FLEET SUPPORT

THE COMPANY PROVIDES THE

OPERATORS OF ALL ITS COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE MODELS ASSISTANCE AND SERVICES TO

FACILITATE EFFICIENT AND SAFE AIRCRAFT OPERATION. COLLECTIVELY KNOWN AS FLEET

SUPPORT SERVICES, THESE ACTIVITIES AND SERVICES INCLUDE FLIGHT AND MAINTENANCE

TRAINING, FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT COSTS, ENGINEERING SERVICES AND TECHNICAL DATA

AND DOCUMENTS. FLEET SUPPORT ACTIVITY BEGINS PRIOR TO AIRCRAFT DELIVERY AS THE

CUSTOMER RECEIVES TRAINING, MANUALS AND TECHNICAL CONSULTING SUPPORT, AND

CONTINUES THROUGHOUT THE OPERATIONAL LIFE OF THE AIRCRAFT. SERVICES PROVIDED

AFTER DELIVERY INCLUDE FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT, CONSULTING ON MAINTENANCE, REPAIR,

AND OPERATIONAL ISSUES BROUGHT FORTH BY THE CUSTOMER OR REGULATORS, UPDATING

MANUALS AND ENGINEERING DATA, AND THE ISSUANCE OF SERVICE BULLETINS THAT IMPACT

THE ENTIRE MODELS FLEET. FIELD SERVICE SUPPORT INVOLVES COMPANY PERSONNEL

LOCATED AT CUSTOMER FACILITIES PROVIDING AND COORDINATING FLEET SUPPORT

ACTIVITIES AND REQUESTS. THE COSTS FOR FLEET SUPPORT ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED

AND HAVE BEEN HISTORICALLY LESS THAN 1.5% OF TOTAL CONSOLIDATED COSTS OF

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THIS LEVEL OF EXPENDITURES IS ANTICIPATED TO CONTINUE IN

THE UPCOMING YEARS. THESE COSTS DO NOT VARY SIGNIFICANTLY WITH CURRENT

PRODUCTION RATES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY

EVALUATES OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE CURRENT AIRCRAFT MODELS, AND ASSESSES THE

MARKETPLACE TO ENSURE THAT ITS FAMILY OF COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT ARE WELL

POSITIONED TO MEET FUTURE REQUIREMENTS OF THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY. THE FUNDAMENTAL

STRATEGY IS TO MAINTAIN A BROAD PRODUCT LINE THAT IS RESPONSIVE TO CHANGING

MARKET CONDITIONS BY MAXIMIZING COMMONALITY AMONG THE BOEING FAMILY OF

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY IS DETERMINED TO CONTINUE TO LEAD

THE INDUSTRY IN CUSTOMER SATISFACTION BY OFFERING PRODUCTS WITH THE HIGHEST

STANDARDS OF QUALITY, SAFETY, TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE, ECONOMIC PERFORMANCE AND

IN-SERVICE SUPPORT.

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

SEGMENT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $768 MILLION IN 2002, $858 MILLION

IN 2001 AND $574 MILLION IN 2000. THE DECREASE IN 2002 FROM 2001 WAS DUE

PRIMARILY TO REDUCED SPENDING ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE 777-300ER AND 747-400ER.

THE INCREASE IN 2001 OVER 2000 WAS DUE PRIMARILY TO INCREASED SPENDING ON THE

DEVELOPMENT OF THE 777-300ER, 777-200LR, 747-400ER AND A SONIC CRUISER AIRPLANE.

THE INITIAL DELIVERY OF THE

747-400ER AND THE ROLLOUT OF THE FIRST 777-300ER OCCURRED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2002. THE INITIAL DELIVERY OF THE 777-300ER IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR IN 2004. THE

INITIAL DELIVERY OF THE 737-900, THE LARGEST MEMBER OF THE 737 NEXT-GENERATION

FAMILY OCCURRED IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF 2001. THE INITIAL DELIVERY OF THE

767-400ER, A STRETCHED VERSION OF 767-300ER, OCCURRED IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF

2000.

IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF

2002, THE COMPANY ANNOUNCED IT WILL FOCUS ITS PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ON THE

DEVELOPMENT OF AN EFFICIENT 200- TO 250-SEAT AIRPLANE THAT WILL FLY 7,000 TO

8,000 NAUTICAL MILES WITH 15 TO 20 PERCENT LOWER FUEL USAGE AT THE TOP END OF

TODAYS COMMERCIAL JET SPEEDS. THE MARKET POTENTIAL FOR A NEW AIRPLANE OF

THIS SIZE IS FORECASTED AT UP TO 3,000 UNITS OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS. THE COMPANY

EXPECTS TO FORMALLY OFFER THE NEW AIRPLANE TO CUSTOMERS IN EARLY 2004, WITH

ENTRY INTO SERVICE TARGETED FOR 2008.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

OVERVIEW

THE WORLDWIDE MARKET FOR

COMMERCIAL JET AIRPLANES CONTINUES TO BE PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY LONG-TERM

TRENDS IN AIRLINE PASSENGER TRAFFIC. THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS UNDERLYING LONG-TERM

TRAFFIC GROWTH ARE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH, BOTH IN DEVELOPED AND EMERGING

COUNTRIES, AND POLITICAL STABILITY. DEMAND FOR THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANES IS FURTHER INFLUENCED BY AIRLINE INDUSTRY PROFITABILITY, WORLD TRADE

POLICIES, GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, ENVIRONMENTAL CONSTRAINTS IMPOSED

UPON AIRPLANE OPERATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, AND PRICE AND OTHER COMPETITIVE

FACTORS.

AIRLINE INDUSTRY ENVIRONMENT

COMMERCIAL AVIATION HAS

BEEN IMPACTED BY AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN THAT BEGAN IN 2001 AND CONTINUED THROUGH

2002. IN ADDITION, THE INDUSTRY SUFFERED A TREMENDOUS SHOCK FROM THE TERRORIST

ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. AIR TRAVEL IN MOST AREAS OF THE WORLD HAS NOT

RECOVERED TO THE VOLUME CARRIED BY THE AIRLINES IN 2000, WHICH IS AFFECTING

PROFITABILITY FOR MANY AIRLINES. U.S. FULL SERVICE AIRLINES HAVE SUFFERED THE

GREATEST LOSSES. HOLIDAY TRAFFIC IN 2002 FOR THE U.S. AIRLINES SHOWED AN

IMPROVEMENT AND MOST CARRIERS INDICATED BETTER FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE. HOWEVER,

THIS IMPROVEMENT WAS FOR ONLY A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME AND THE MAJOR U.S. FULL

SERVICE AIRLINES REPORTED SIGNIFICANT LOSSES FOR 2002. IN CONTRAST, LOW FARE

AIRLINES IN THE U.S. AND IN EUROPE ARE REPORTING POSITIVE FINANCIAL RESULTS AND

ARE GROWING. EUROPEAN NETWORK AIRLINES ARE EXPECTED TO SHOW BETTER RESULTS THAN

THEIR U.S. COUNTERPARTS FOR THE FISCAL PERIOD ENDING IN MARCH OF 2003. TRAFFIC

BETWEEN ASIA AND EUROPE HAS REBOUNDED TO PRE-SEPTEMBER 11 LEVELS. THIS TREND

COMBINED WITH STRONGER TRAFFIC WITHIN THE REGION IS OFFSETTING THE SLOW GROWTH

OVER THE PACIFIC PERMITTING MOST ASIAN AIRLINES TO SHOW PROFITS.

OUR TIMETABLE FOR INDUSTRY

RECOVERY HAS BEEN DELAYED. WE PRESENTLY SEE 2003 TO BE THE YEAR OF RECOVERY FOR

WORLD AIR TRAVEL; LATE 2003/EARLY 2004 TO BE THE YEAR OF AIRLINE PROFITABILITY

RECOVERY; 2004 TO BE THE YEAR OF AIRPLANE ORDER RECOVERY; AND 2005 TO BE THE

YEAR OF DELIVERY RECOVERY. THE MAJOR UNCERTAINTY THAT IS CURBING ECONOMIC GROWTH

AND A STRONGER AND SOONER REBOUND IN THE INDUSTRY IS THE IRAQI SITUATION 

IN TERMS OF TIMING, SCALE OF MILITARY ENGAGEMENT, EFFECT ON OIL PRICES, AND

CLARITY OF POLITICAL RESOLUTION.

THE COMPANYS 20-YEAR

FORECAST OF THE AVERAGE LONG-TERM GROWTH RATE IN PASSENGER TRAFFIC IS 4.9%

ANNUALLY, BASED ON PROJECTED AVERAGE WORLDWIDE ANNUAL ECONOMIC REAL GROWTH OF

2.9%. BASED ON GLOBAL ECONOMIC GROWTH PROJECTIONS OVER THE LONG TERM, AND TAKING

INTO CONSIDERATION AN INCREASINGLY COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT, INCREASING

UTILIZATION LEVELS OF THE WORLDWIDE AIRPLANE FLEET AND REQUIREMENTS TO REPLACE

OLDER AIRPLANES, THE COMPANY PROJECTED ALMOST A $5 TRILLION MARKET FOR NEW

AIRPLANES AND SERVICES OVER THE NEXT 20 YEARS. THIS IS A LONG-TERM FORECAST;

HISTORICALLY, WHILE FACTORS SUCH AS THE GULF WAR AND TICKET CHARGES FOR SECURITY

HAVE HAD SIGNIFICANT IMPACT OVER THE SPAN OF SEVERAL YEARS, THEY HAVE NOT

DRAMATICALLY AFFECTED THE LONGER TERM TRENDS IN THE WORLD ECONOMY, AND

THEREFORE, THE COMPANYS MARKET OUTLOOK.

AIRLINE DEREGULATION

WORLDWIDE, THE AIRLINE

INDUSTRY HAS EXPERIENCED PROGRESSIVE DEREGULATION OF DOMESTIC MARKETS AND

INCREASING LIBERALIZATION OF INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO

VIRTUALLY ALL AIR TRAVEL TOOK PLACE WITHIN A FRAMEWORK OF DOMESTIC AND

INTERNATIONAL REGULATORY OVERSIGHT. SINCE THEN, AN INCREASING NUMBER OF

COUNTRIES, MOST NOTABLY THE UNITED STATES, AUSTRALIA, JAPAN AND THE COUNTRIES IN

WESTERN EUROPE, HAVE ELIMINATED RESTRICTIVE REGULATIONS FOR DOMESTIC AIRLINE

MARKETS AND PROMOTED A MORE OPEN-MARKET CLIMATE FOR INTERNATIONAL SERVICES.

THESE TRENDS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE, BUT AT VARYING RATES IN DIFFERENT PARTS

OF THE WORLD. AT THE END OF THE NEXT DECADE, AN ESTIMATED TWO-THIRDS OF AIR

TRAVEL WILL BE IN OPEN MARKETS. LIBERALIZATION OF GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS,

TOGETHER WITH INCREASED AIRPLANE RANGE CAPABILITIES, GIVES AIRLINES GREATER

FREEDOM TO PURSUE OPTIMAL FLEET-MIX STRATEGIES. THIS INCREASED FLEXIBILITY

ALLOWS THE AIRLINES TO ACCOMMODATE TRAFFIC GROWTH BY SELECTING THE BEST MIX OF

FLIGHT FREQUENCIES AND AIRPLANE SIZE AND CAPABILITIES FOR THEIR ROUTE SYSTEMS.

IN INTERCONTINENTAL MARKETS, MORE LIBERAL BILATERAL AIR SERVICE AGREEMENTS

PROVIDE AN IMPORTANT STIMULUS TO OPENING NEW CITY-PAIR MARKETS, WHICH FAVOR

INCREASED FLIGHT FREQUENCY OVER CAPACITY GROWTH. IN PARALLEL WITH REGULATORY

LIBERALIZATION, IMPROVEMENTS IN AIRPLANE RANGE PERFORMANCE WILL CONTINUE TO

ALLOW AIRLINES TO EXPAND THE NUMBER OF DIRECT CITY-TO-CITY ROUTES, THUS REDUCING

THE RELIANCE ON INDIRECT ROUTES THROUGH CENTRAL HUBS THAT REQUIRE LARGER

CAPACITY AIRPLANES.

- 30 -

INDUSTRY COMPETITIVENESS

THE COMPANY CURRENTLY FACES

AGGRESSIVE INTERNATIONAL COMPETITORS THAT ARE SEEKING TO INCREASE MARKET SHARE.

THIS COMPETITIVE FACTOR WAS DEMONSTRATED BY THE DECISION OF AIRBUS TO INTRODUCE

THE A380, A PROPOSED AIRCRAFT WITH PASSENGER SEATING GREATER THAN THE 747, TO

INCREASE MARKET SHARE AT THE UPPER END OF THE LARGE AIRPLANE MARKET. THIS MARKET

ENVIRONMENT HAS RESULTED IN INTENSE PRESSURES ON PRICING AND OTHER COMPETITIVE

FACTORS. THE COMPANYS FOCUS ON IMPROVING PROCESSES AND OTHER COST

REDUCTION EFFORTS IS INTENDED TO ENHANCE ITS ABILITY TO PURSUE PRICING

STRATEGIES THAT ENABLE THE COMPANY TO MAINTAIN LEADERSHIP AT SATISFACTORY

MARGINS. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANYS EXTENSIVE CUSTOMER SUPPORT SERVICES

NETWORK FOR AIRLINES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD PLAYS A KEY ROLE IN MAINTAINING HIGH

CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. AS AN EXAMPLE, ON-LINE ACCESS IS AVAILABLE TO ALL AIRLINE

CUSTOMERS FOR ENGINEERING DRAWINGS, PARTS LISTS, SERVICE BULLETINS AND

MAINTENANCE MANUALS.

THE COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT

MARKET AND THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY REMAIN EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES AND INCREASED LOWER-FARE TRAVEL HAVE COMBINED TO CAUSE A LONG-TERM

DOWNWARD TREND IN PASSENGER REVENUE YIELDS WORLDWIDE (MEASURED IN REAL TERMS).

MARKET LIBERALIZATION WITHIN EUROPE HAS ENABLED LOW-COST AIRLINES TO ENTER THE

MARKET. THESE AIRLINES INCREASE THE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON AIRFARES, SIMILAR TO

THE COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT IN THE UNITED STATES. AIRFARES BETWEEN ASIA AND THE

UNITED STATES ARE AMONG THE LOWEST YIELD (AIRFARE DIVIDED BY REVENUE PASSENGER

MILES) OF ANY IN THE WORLD. THESE FACTORS RESULT IN CONTINUED PRICE PRESSURE ON

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS. MAJOR PRODUCTIVITY GAINS ARE ESSENTIAL TO ENSURE A

FAVORABLE MARKET POSITION AT ACCEPTABLE PROFIT MARGINS.

IN JULY 2000, THREE MAJOR

EUROPEAN AEROSPACE COMPANIES (AEROSPATIALE MATRA OF FRANCE, DAIMLERCHRYSLER

AEROSPACE OF GERMANY, AND CONSTRUCCIONES AERONAUTICA OF SPAIN) COMBINED TO FORM

THE EUROPEAN AERONAUTIC DEFENCE AND SPACE COMPANY (EADS). AS A RESULT OF THE

FORMATION, EADS BECAME AN 80% OWNER OF AIRBUS INDUSTRIE (AI) AND LED THE EFFORT

FOR THE FORMATION OF THE AIRBUS INTEGRATED COMPANY (AIC) IN EARLY 2001. THE

CREATION OF THE AIC EFFECTIVELY CHANGES THE AIRBUS ROLE, FROM THAT OF A

MARKETER/DISTRIBUTOR OF LARGE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES TO ONE INCLUDING COMPLETE

MANUFACTURING RESPONSIBILITY. THE AIC IS INCORPORATED UNDER FRENCH LAW AS A

PRIVATELY HELD CORPORATION OWNED 80% BY EADS AND 20% BY BAE SYSTEMS.

OVER THE PAST FIVE YEARS,

SALES OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 53% OF THE

COMPANYS TOTAL COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES THIRD-PARTY SEGMENT SALES;

APPROXIMATELY 50% OF THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002, WAS WITH CUSTOMERS BASED OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES. CONTINUED

ACCESS TO GLOBAL MARKETS REMAINS VITAL TO THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO FULLY

REALIZE ITS SALES POTENTIAL AND PROJECTED LONG-TERM INVESTMENT RETURNS.

SUMMARY

ALTHOUGH NEAR-TERM MARKET

UNCERTAINTIES REMAIN, PARTICULARLY WITH RESPECT TO THE RECOVERY POST SEPTEMBER

11, THE LONG-TERM MARKET OUTLOOK APPEARS FAVORABLE. THE COMPANY IS WELL

POSITIONED IN ALL SEGMENTS OF THE COMMERCIAL JET AIRPLANE MARKET, AND INTENDS TO

REMAIN THE AIRLINE INDUSTRYS PREFERRED SUPPLIER THROUGH EMPHASIS ON

PRODUCT OFFERINGS AND CUSTOMER SERVICE THAT PROVIDE THE BEST OVERALL VALUE IN

THE INDUSTRY.

2001 AND $11.9 BILLION IN 2000. INCREASED REVENUES IN 2002 WERE PRIMARILY DUE TO

ADDITIONAL DELIVERIES ON THE C-17 GLOBEMASTER, F/A-18E/F SUPER HORNET, F-15

EAGLE, JDAM, AH-64 APACHE PROGRAMS AND INCREASED AEROSPACE SUPPORT VOLUME. THE

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS BUSINESS SEGMENT IS BROADLY DIVERSIFIED,

HORNET PROGRAM ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 6% OF TOTAL 2002 SEGMENT REVENUES.

REVENUES INCLUDE AMOUNTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PRODUCTION PROGRAMS AND AMOUNTS

RECOGNIZED ON A COST-REIMBURSEMENT BASIS FOR DEVELOPMENTAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS THE

F/A-22 RAPTOR, V-22 OSPREY, AND THE RAH-66 COMANCHE. THE INCREASE IN REVENUES

BETWEEN 2001 AND 2000 IS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED AIRCRAFT DELIVERIES IN 2001,

ONE ADDITIONAL C-17 GLOBEMASTER, FOUR 737 C-40A CLIPPERS AND FOUR CH-47 CHINOOK

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE

SYSTEMS SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS FOR 2002, 2001 AND 2000 WERE $1,652 MILLION,

$1,346 MILLION AND $1,245 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE SEGMENT OPERATING MARGINS

FOR 2002, 2001 AND 2000 WERE 11.8%, 10.8% AND 10.4%, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2002

OPERATING RESULTS REFLECT STRONG PROFITS ON MAJOR PRODUCTION PROGRAMS. THE

SEGMENT OPERATING MARGINS FOR 2002 WERE 11.2% AFTER ADJUSTING FOR GAINS OF $64

MILLION RELATED TO THE DIVESTITURE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS AND A FAVORABLE

ADJUSTMENT OF $24 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO F-15 EAGLE PROGRAM CHARGES TAKEN IN

1999. INCREASED EARNINGS IN 2001 FROM 2000 WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ADDITIONAL

DELIVERY OF ONE C-17 GLOBEMASTER, FOUR 737 C-40A CLIPPERS AND FOUR CH-47

DELIVERIES. THE SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS FOR 2001 INCLUDE THE RECOGNITION OF

$48 MILLION OF CHARGES RELATING TO ASSET REDUCTIONS ATTRIBUTABLE TO REDUCED WORK

VOLUME AT THE PHILADELPHIA SITE, AND $46 MILLION OF CHARGES ASSOCIATED WITH THE

JOINT STRIKE FIGHTER PROGRAM AND IDLE MANUFACTURING ASSETS. THE 2001 OPERATING

EARNINGS ALSO INCLUDED A FAVORABLE ADJUSTMENT OF $57 MILLION ATTRIBUTABLE TO

F-15 EAGLE PROGRAM CHARGES TAKEN IN 1999. EXCLUSIVE OF THESE ITEMS, THE SEGMENT

OPERATING MARGINS FOR 2001 WERE 11.1%.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING

TO INVEST IN BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WHERE IT CAN USE ITS CUSTOMER KNOWLEDGE,

TECHNICAL STRENGTH AND LARGE-SCALE SYSTEMS INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES TO SHAPE THE

MARKET. INVESTMENTS IN UNMANNED SYSTEMS CONTINUE TO LEVERAGE THE COMPANYS

CAPABILITIES IN ARCHITECTURES, SYSTEM-OF-SYSTEMS INTEGRATION AND WEAPON SYSTEMS

TECHNOLOGIES TO PROVIDE TRANSFORMATIONAL CAPABILITIES FOR THE U.S. MILITARY.

INVESTMENT IS CONTINUING IN THE 767 TANKER PROGRAMS FOR THE U.S. AIR FORCE AND

INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS. COMPANY INVESTMENTS IN AIRBORNE ELECTRONIC ATTACK AND

PRECISION WEAPONS AND ADVANCED ROTORCRAFT SYSTEMS ARE EXPANDING ITS BREADTH OF

PRODUCTS AND CAPABILITIES ENABLING IT TO ACCESS LARGER PORTIONS OF THE COMBAT

SYSTEMS MARKETS.

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND

MISSILE SYSTEMS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN 2002 WAS $345 MILLION,

COMPARED WITH $258 MILLION IN 2001 AND $257 MILLION IN 2000. CURRENT RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES ARE FOCUSED ON THE INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC 767

TANKER PROGRAM, REFLECTED IN THE 2002 INCREASED EXPENDITURES OVER 2001. THIS

PROGRAM REPRESENTS A LARGE OPPORTUNITY TO PROVIDE STATE OF THE ART TANKING

CAPABILITIES TO OUR POTENTIAL DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL CUSTOMERS. IT

DEMONSTRATES THE SYNERGISTIC VALUE OF THE DIVERSIFIED BOEING PORTFOLIO IN

PROVIDING BEST VALUE SOLUTIONS TO OUR CUSTOMERS. ITALY RECENTLY BECAME THE FIRST

CUSTOMER OF THE 767 TANKER ORDERING FOUR AIRCRAFT WITH FIRST AIRCRAFT DELIVERY

SCHEDULED IN 2005. THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT CONTINUES

TO PURSUE BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES WHERE IT CAN USE ITS CUSTOMER KNOWLEDGE,

TECHNICAL STRENGTH AND LARGE-SCALE INTEGRATION CAPABILITIES. THE SEGMENTS

LEVEL OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES IS CONSISTENT WITH THIS APPROACH,

AND REFLECTS THE RECENT BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT, WHICH HAS PRESENTED FEW MAJOR

NEW-START OPPORTUNITIES. OTHER RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS INCLUDE UPGRADE

AND TECHNOLOGY INSERTIONS TO ENHANCE THE CAPABILITY AND COMPETITIVENESS OF

CURRENT PRODUCT LINES, AS WELL AS EXPLORATION OF NEW MARKETS SUCH AS UNMANNED

AIR VEHICLES (UAVS).

BACKLOG

TOTAL CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG

FOR MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS WAS $21.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31,

2002, $17.6 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND $17.1 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2000.

MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILES SYSTEMS CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG INCREASED BY 20% IN

2002 COMPARED TO 2001. THE INCREASE IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001 IS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTED TO THE CAPTURE OF SEVERAL KEY INTERNATIONAL AWARDS INCLUDING THE

KOREAN F-15 EAGLE CONTRACT AND THE ITALIAN 767 TANKER CONTRACT. BACKLOG ALSO

INCREASED DUE TO RATE INCREASES ON SEVERAL DOMESTIC PROGRAMS IN LOW RATE INITIAL

PRODUCTION INCLUDING V-22 OSPREY AND THE F/A-22 RAPTOR. THE C-17 GLOBEMASTER

PROGRAM MAINTAINED CONSISTENT BACKLOG AS NEW ORDERS REPLACED SALES ON THE

EXISTING PRODUCTION CONTRACTS. THE PROGRAM IS WELL POSITIONED FOR CONTINUED

SALES WELL INTO THIS DECADE. THE F/A-18E/F SUPER HORNET PROGRAM BACKLOG

INCREASED MODERATELY AS THE CUSTOMER CONTINUES TO INCREASE PRODUCTION RATE. THE

JDAM PROGRAM BACKLOG ALSO INCREASED MODERATELY WITH ADDITIONAL ORDERS FROM BOTH

THE NAVY AND AIR FORCE. AEROSPACE SUPPORT ORDERS CONTINUED TO INCREASE THIS PAST

YEAR.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

OVERVIEW

THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF

DEFENSE (DOD), REPRESENTS NEARLY 50% OF THE WORLDS DEFENSE BUDGET, AND

REMAINS THE PRINCIPAL CUSTOMER OF THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS

BUSINESS UNIT. SEVERAL TRENDS ARE EMERGING THAT ARE SHAPING CUSTOMER BEHAVIOR IN

THIS MARKET. U.S. MILITARY FORCE STRUCTURE IS SHRINKING, ITS PLATFORMS ARE

AGING, AND THE TEMPO OF OPERATIONS AND ENGAGEMENTS WORLDWIDE REMAINS HIGH. THE

UNITED STATES CURRENT MILITARY ACTIVITY DEMONSTRATES THE VALUE OF SYSTEMS

SOLUTIONS THAT ALLOW ALL SYSTEMS TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER, TO OPERATE OVER

LONGER RANGES, ARE UNMANNED AND PROVIDE THE ADVANTAGES OF PRECISION, PERSISTENCE

AND SELECTIVE ENGAGEMENT. THESE FACTORS ARE DRIVING THE U.S. DOD, ALONG WITH

MILITARIES WORLDWIDE, TO FOCUS ON WAYS TO TRANSFORM THEIR FORCES AND THE WAY

THEY OPERATE.

MILITARY TRANSFORMATION

THE TRANSFORMATION IN

FORCES IS EVIDENCED BY A TREND TOWARD SMALLER, BUT MORE CAPABLE AND MORE

TECHNOLOGICALLY ADVANCED FORCE STRUCTURES. THE TRANSFORMATION IN ACQUISITION IS

EVIDENCED BY AN INCREASING TREND TOWARD SPIRAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS, COOPERATIVE

INTERNATIONAL DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AND A DEMONSTRATED WILLINGNESS TO EXPLORE NEW

FORMS OF ACQUISITION AND OWNERSHIP INCLUDING THE LEASE OF MILITARY SUPPORT

AIRCRAFT.

INSTITUTIONS AND EVENTS

CONTINUE TO SHAPE THE DEFENSE INDUSTRIAL ENVIRONMENT. FROM AN INSTITUTIONAL

PERSPECTIVE, THE ESTABLISHMENT OF THE HOMELAND DEFENSE AND U.S. NORTHERN COMMAND

ARE CREATING NEW ORGANIZATIONS WITH RESPONSIBILITIES FOR NATIONAL AIRSPACE

CONTROL, COASTAL PROTECTION AND CIVIL SUPPORT. THE CREATION OF THE U.S.

STRATEGIC COMMAND IS CONSOLIDATING RESPONSIBILITIES FOR GLOBAL STRIKE,

INTEGRATED MISSILE DEFENSE, INFORMATION OPERATIONS, COMMAND, CONTROL,

COMMUNICATIONS AND COMPUTERS, AND INTELLIGENCE, SURVEILLANCE AND RECONNAISANCE

INTO A SINGLE ORGANIZATION. EVENTS LIKE OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM AND THE

CONTINUING WAR ON GLOBAL TERRORISM REAFFIRMS THE NEED FOR THE RAPID PROJECTION

OF DECISIVE COMBAT POWER AROUND THE WORLD AND EMPHASIZES THE NEED FOR NEW

CAPABILITIES AND SOLUTIONS FOR THE WARFIGHTER. TOWARD THAT END, THE DOD IS FULLY

COMMITTED TO A TRANSFORMATION THAT WILL ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN ADVANTAGES THROUGH

CHANGES IN OPERATIONAL CONCEPTS, ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AND TECHNOLOGIES THAT

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE WARFIGHTING CAPABILITIES.

COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT

THE GLOBAL COMPETITIVE

ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO INTENSIFY, WITH INCREASED FOCUS ON THE U.S. DEFENSE

MARKET, THE WORLDS LARGEST AND MOST ATTRACTIVE. MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND

MISSILE SYSTEMS FACES STRONG COMPETITION IN ALL MARKET SEGMENTS, PRIMARILY FROM

LOCKHEED MARTIN, RAYTHEON, EADS AND NORTHROP GRUMMAN. THE FINANCIAL PROBLEMS

PLAGUING SOME DOMESTIC INDUSTRY COMPETITORS APPEAR TO BE RESOLVED, ENABLING THEM

TO ACQUIRE NEW ASSETS AND COMPETE MORE VIGOROUSLY. EADS CONTINUES TO

STRATEGICALLY BUILD A PRESENCE IN THE U.S. MARKET THROUGH BUILDING ITS NORTH

AMERICAN OPERATIONS AND BY PARTNERING WITH U.S. DEFENSE COMPANIES.

CONTINUED INDUSTRY

CONSOLIDATION AND MARKET CONCENTRATION WAS MARKED BY THE ACQUISITION OF TRW BY

NORTHROP GRUMMAN. NORTHROPS POSITION IN THE UAV, SPACE, SYSTEMS

INTEGRATION, AND STRIKE MARKETS HAS BEEN STRENGTHENED. HOWEVER, ALL PRIME

CONTRACTORS CONTINUE TO PARTNER OR SERVE AS MAJOR SUPPLIERS TO EACH OTHER ON

VARIOUS PROGRAMS. AT THE LOWER TIERS, CONSOLIDATION PERSISTS AND SELECT

COMPANIES HAVE BEEN POSITIONING FOR LARGER ROLES, ESPECIALLY IN THE AEROSPACE

SUPPORT MARKET.

IN ADDITION TO LEVERAGING

ITS INTERNAL RESOURCES AND CAPABILITIES, THE COMPANY IS CREATING A COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE BY DEVELOPING GLOBAL STRATEGIC RELATIONSHIPS TO PROVIDE SUPERIOR VALUE

FOR ITS CUSTOMERS, BOTH IN THE U.S. AND ABROAD.

SUMMARY

EVENTS LIKE NUCLEAR

PROLIFERATION IN NORTH KOREA, OPERATION ENDURING FREEDOM AND THE CONTINUED WAR

ON TERRORISM, HIGHLIGHT THE FACT THAT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY GOALS ARE NOT

RHETORICAL. THERE IS AN IMMEDIATE AND A DURABLE NEED TO MAINTAIN STRONG U.S.

DEFENSE CAPABILITIES COVERING A VERY BROAD SPECTRUM OF THREATS AND RESPONSES.

NEAR-TERM DOD BUDGETS HAVE INCREASED, AND LONGER-RANGE FORECASTS EXPECT DOD

BUDGETS TO GROW FASTER THAN ANTICIPATED PRIOR TO SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. HOWEVER,

WITH A SOFTENING GLOBAL ECONOMY AND ANTICIPATED FEDERAL BUDGET TENSIONS,

ALLOCATIONS TO DOD PROCUREMENT ARE UNLIKELY TO INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS

SUGGESTS THAT THE DOD WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON AFFORDABILITY STRATEGIES

EMPHASIZING NETWORK-CENTRIC OPERATIONS, LONG RANGE STRIKE, UNMANNED AIR COMBAT

AND RECONNAISSANCE VEHICLES, PRECISION GUIDED WEAPONS AND CONTINUED

PRIVATIZATION OF LOGISTICS AND SUPPORT ACTIVITIES AS A MEANS TO IMPROVE OVERALL

EFFECTIVENESS WHILE MAINTAINING CONTROL OVER COSTS. THE COMPANYS

CAPABILITIES AND PROGRAMS ARE WELL SUITED TO PROVIDE THE MILITARY CAPABILITIES

ESSENTIAL TO MEET THE CHALLENGES FACING OUR NATION.

SEGMENT REVENUES WERE $11.0 BILLION IN 2002, COMPARED WITH $10.4 BILLION IN 2001

AND $8.0 BILLION IN 2000. THE SEGMENT REMAINS BROADLY DIVERSIFIED. THE

CONTRIBUTORS TO 2002 SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT REVENUES INCLUDED FIVE

MARKET SEGMENTS: INTEGRATED BATTLESPACE, MISSILE DEFENSE, HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT AND

EXPLORATION, LAUNCH AND SATELLITE AND HOMELAND SECURITY. THE INCREASE IN

REVENUES FROM 2001 TO 2002 WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO INCREASED ACTIVITY IN MISSILE

DEFENSE OFFSET BY DECREASES IN LAUNCH AND SATELLITE DUE TO CONTINUED MARKET

DOWNTURN. 2001 REVENUES WERE HIGHER THAN 2000 REVENUES DUE PRIMARILY TO

INCREASED ACTIVITY ON INTEGRATED BATTLESPACE PROGRAMS AND THE ACQUISITION OF

BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS (BSS) IN OCTOBER 2000.

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT

REVENUES FOR 2003 ARE PROJECTED TO BE IN THE $12 BILLION RANGE. THE GREATEST

GROWTH IS EXPECTED IN THE INTEGRATED BATTLESPACE MARKET AS SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS HAS BECOME THE DODS LEADING INDUSTRY PARTNER IN EXECUTING

THE MILITARY TRANSFORMATION WITH THE CAPTURE OF THE FUTURE COMBAT SYSTEMS

PROGRAM, JOINT TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEM, AND THE FAMILY OF ADVANCED BEYOND

LINE-OF-SIGHT TERMINALS PROGRAM. MISSILE DEFENSE EXPECTS CONTINUED GROWTH AS THE

MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY CONTINUES ITS EMPHASIS ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF VARIOUS

MISSILE DEFENSE CAPABILITIES.

OPERATING EARNINGS

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

SEGMENT OPERATING EARNINGS FOR 2002 WERE $357 MILLION COMPARED WITH $619 MILLION

IN 2001 AND $(243) MILLION IN 2000, AND THE RELATED OPERATING MARGINS WERE 3.3%,

6.0% AND (3.0)% FOR 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY. THE 2002 OPERATING

RESULTS INCLUDE A $100 MILLION PRE-TAX CHARGE TO WRITE-DOWN AN EQUITY INVESTMENT

IN TELEDESIC, LLC. ALSO CONTRIBUTING TO THE 2002 DECREASED OPERATING EARNINGS

WAS COST GROWTH ON SATELLITE PROGRAMS AND THE CONTINUED DOWNTURN IN THE LAUNCH

AND COMMERCIAL SATELLITE MARKET. THE 2000 OPERATING RESULTS INCLUDED A PRE-TAX

CHARGE OF $505 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THE IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

FROM THE ACQUISITION OF THE HUGHES SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES AND

AUTOMETRIC BUSINESSES, ALONG WITH $78 MILLION IN COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH A DELTA

III DEMONSTRATION LAUNCH IN AUGUST 2000.

THE 2002 SEGMENT OPERATING

MARGINS WERE REDUCED FROM 2001 DUE TO FACTORY COST, SCHEDULE PERFORMANCE AND A

SATELLITE CONTRACT TERMINATION IN THE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE BUSINESS ALONG WITH

737 AEW&C DEVELOPMENT COST GROWTH. THE REDUCED 2002 MARGINS WERE OFFSET BY

FAVORABLE COMMERCIAL SPACE CONTRACT ACTIONS, IMPROVED MARGINS FOR INTEGRATED

BATTLESPACE, AND GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE PROGRAM PERFORMANCE. THE 2001

OPERATING MARGINS WERE IMPROVED OVER THE 2000 OPERATING MARGINS PRIMARILY DUE TO

REDUCED NEW PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELTA IV RS-68

ENGINE AS IT COMPLETED DEVELOPMENTAL ENGINE CERTIFICATION AND TRANSITIONED TO

PRODUCTION. THE COMPANY PROJECTS THAT 2003 OPERATING EARNINGS WILL CONTINUE TO

BE IMPACTED BY NEW PROGRAM DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES BUT TO A LESSER DEGREE THAN IN

PRIOR YEARS, PRIMARILY DUE TO THE TRANSITION OF THE DELTA IV LAUNCH VEHICLE INTO

PRODUCTION.

- 34 -

IN FEBRUARY 2002, SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS UNDERTOOK A REORGANIZATION OF ITS COMMERCIAL SATELLITE

MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES IN RESPONSE TO POOR PERFORMANCE COMPOUNDED BY

UNFAVORABLE MARKET CONDITIONS. THE IMPACT TO EARNINGS BY SATELLITE PROGRAM COST

GROWTH WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FAVORABLE CONTRACTUAL ACTIONS. THE NET IMPACT TO

THE YEAR FOR BSS WAS A REDUCTION IN OPERATING EARNINGS OF APPROXIMATELY $146

MILLION. PROGRESS HAS BEEN MADE IN IMPLEMENTING PROCESS IMPROVEMENTS AND PROGRAM

MANAGEMENT BEST PRACTICES, HOWEVER, FACTORY PROBLEMS THAT ARISE OUT OF

ACCEPTANCE TESTING CONTINUE TO IMPACT EXISTING CONTRACTS. AS A RESULT,

COMPLETION SCHEDULES HAVE SLIPPED WHICH HAS RESULTED IN EXPOSING THE COMPANY TO

THE RISK OF CONTRACT TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT (TFD) NOTIFICATION.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER

OF 2002, THE COMPANY RECEIVED A TFD NOTIFICATION ON A COMMERCIAL SATELLITE

CONTRACT THAT HAD AN EXPECTED DELIVERY BEYOND THE CONTRACTUAL TFD DATE. THE

CUSTOMER NO LONGER REQUIRED THE SATELLITE FOR THEIR CURRENT BUSINESS BASE. THE

COMPANY IS CURRENTLY MARKETING THE SATELLITE, WHICH WAS ADJUSTED TO THE

ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE. EARLY IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF 2003, THE COMPANY

PASSED THE TFD DATES FOR TWO COMMERCIAL SATELLITE CONTRACTS. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES

A TFD SITUATION FOR EACH OF THESE CONTRACTS IS NOT LIKELY TO RESULT IN A

MATERIAL FINANCIAL IMPACT DUE TO CONTINUING LEGAL, PRODUCTION, AND CONTRACTUAL

EFFORTS IN WORK.

CERTAIN LAUNCH AND

SATELLITE CONTRACTS INCLUDE PROVISIONS FOR REPLACEMENT LAUNCH SERVICES OR

HARDWARE IF SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE CRITERIA ARE NOT MET. THE COMPANY HAS

HISTORICALLY PURCHASED INSURANCE TO COVER THESE OBLIGATIONS WHEN ALLOWED UNDER

THE TERMS OF THE CONTRACT. DUE TO RECENT EVENTS, THE CURRENT INSURANCE MARKET

REFLECTS UNUSUALLY HIGH PREMIUM RATES AND ALSO SUFFERS FROM A LACK OF CAPACITY

TO HANDLE ALL INSURANCE REQUIREMENTS. ALTHOUGH THE COMPANY DOES NOT INTEND TO DO

SO, IT MAY ELECT TO FOREGO THE PROCUREMENT OF THIRD-PARTY INSURANCE AND,

INSTEAD, RETAIN SUCH RISKS INTERNALLY. MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THE CONTRACT COST

ESTIMATES HAVE SUFFICIENT PROVISIONS TO COVER THE EXPECTED VALUE FOR THESE

RISKS.

PREVIOUSLY IDENTIFIED

MARKET-BASED RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH DELTA III INVENTORY IS BEING MITIGATED BY A

COMBINATION OF REUSING INVENTORY ON OTHER DELTA PROGRAMS, CUSTOMER PAYMENTS

PROVIDED TO REASSIGN PAYLOADS TO OTHER LAUNCH VEHICLES, AND THE RETENTION OF

EXISTING CUSTOMER DEPOSITS SHOULD THOSE CUSTOMERS TERMINATE THEIR CONTRACT FOR

DELTA III LAUNCHES. AT THIS TIME THE DELTA III INVENTORY IS NO LONGER CONSIDERED

A MATERIAL FINANCIAL RISK.

THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE, IN

WHICH THE COMPANY IS A 40% PARTNER WITH RSC ENERGIA (25%) OF RUSSIA, KVAERNER

ASA (20%) OF NORWAY, AND KB YUZHNOYE/PO YUZHMASH (15%) OF UKRAINE, PROVIDES

OCEAN-BASED LAUNCH SERVICES TO COMMERCIAL SATELLITE CUSTOMERS. THE VENTURE HAD

ONE SUCCESSFUL LAUNCH IN 2002. THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN THIS VENTURE AS

OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, IS REPORTED AT ZERO, WHICH REFLECTS THE RECOGNITION OF

LOSSES REPORTED BY SEA LAUNCH IN PRIOR YEARS. THE VENTURE INCURRED LOSSES IN

2002, DUE TO THE RELATIVELY LOW VOLUME OF LAUNCHES, REFLECTING A DEPRESSED

SATELLITE MARKET. THE COMPANY HAS FINANCIAL EXPOSURE WITH RESPECT TO THE

VENTURE, WHICH RELATES TO GUARANTEES BY THE COMPANY PROVIDED TO CERTAIN SEA

LAUNCH CREDITORS, PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY TO A SEA LAUNCH

CUSTOMER OF $33 MILLION AND FINANCIAL EXPOSURE RELATED TO ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE/INVENTORY OF $253 MILLION. THE EXPOSURES RELATED TO GUARANTEES ARE

INCLUDED IN THE OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND DISCLOSED IN NOTE

20 TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY AND LOCKHEED

MARTIN ARE 50-50 PARTNERS IN UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE, WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL

GROUND PROCESSING OF THE SPACE SHUTTLE FLEET AND FOR SPACE-RELATED OPERATIONS

WITH THE U.S. AIR FORCE. UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE ALSO PERFORMS MODIFICATIONS,

TESTING AND CHECKOUT OPERATIONS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO READY THE SPACE SHUTTLE FOR

LAUNCH. UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE OPERATIONS ARE PERFORMED UNDER COST-PLUS-TYPE

CONTRACTS. THE COMPANYS PROPORTIONATE SHARE OF JOINT VENTURE EARNINGS IS

RECOGNIZED AS INCOME. THE SEGMENTS OPERATING EARNINGS INCLUDE EARNINGS OF

$68 MILLION, $72 MILLION, AND $60 MILLION FOR 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY,

ATTRIBUTABLE TO UNITED SPACE ALLIANCE.

ON FEBRUARY 1, 2003, THE

COUNTRY EXPERIENCED THE TRAGIC LOSS OF SPACE SHUTTLE COLUMBIA AND ITS

SEVEN-PERSON CREW. THE COMPANY IS ASSISTING NASA TO DETERMINE THE CAUSE OF THIS

ACCIDENT. THIS ACCIDENT DID NOT IMPACT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

FOR 2002, AND IT IS TOO EARLY TO DETERMINE THE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

BUSINESS OPERATIONS FOR 2003 AND BEYOND.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

WITHIN THE SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS BUSINESSES THE COMPANY CONTINUED INVESTING IN THE NEW DELTA IV

EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE WHICH RESULTED IN ITS SUCCESSFUL INAUGURAL COMMERCIAL

LAUNCH IN NOVEMBER OF 2002. THIS PRODUCT GIVES THE COMPANY GREATER ACCESS TO A

PORTION OF THE LAUNCH MARKET THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY UNAVAILABLE WITH THE DELTA II

ROCKET ALONE.

- 35 -

IN THE COMMUNICATIONS

MARKET, THE COMPANY IS INVESTING TO ENABLE CONNECTIVITY BETWEEN EXISTING

AIR/GROUND PLATFORMS, INCREASE COMMUNICATIONS AVAILABILITY AND BANDWIDTH THROUGH

MORE ROBUST SPACE SYSTEMS, AND LEVERAGE INNOVATIVE COMMUNICATIONS CONCEPTS.

INVESTMENTS WERE MADE IN GLOBAL SITUATIONAL AWARENESS CONCEPTS TO DEVELOP

COMMUNICATION SYSTEM ARCHITECTURES TO SUPPORT VARIOUS BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES

INCLUDING FUTURE COMBAT SYSTEMS, JOINT TACTICAL RADIO SYSTEM, FAB-T AND GLOBAL

MISSILE DEFENSE. A MAJOR CONTRIBUTOR TO THE COMPANYS SUPPORT OF THESE DOD

TRANSFORMATION PROGRAMS IS THE INVESTMENT IN THE BOEING INTEGRATION CENTER WHERE

THE COMPANYS NETWORK CENTRIC OPERATIONS CONCEPTS ARE DEVELOPED IN

PARTNERSHIP WITH ITS CUSTOMERS. THE COMPANY ALSO WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE FOCUSED

INVESTMENTS THAT WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEXT-GENERATION SPACE

INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS.

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE, EXCLUDING IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT,

WAS $397 MILLION IN 2002 COMPARED TO $526 MILLION IN 2001 AND 2000. SIGNIFICANT

INVESTMENT IN DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS AT THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT

CONTINUED DURING 2002. COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENDITURES

SUPPORTED THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE DELTA IV LAUNCH VEHICLE. DELTA IV DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE HAS BEEN REDUCED BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENTS PARTICIPATION IN

DEVELOPING THE EVOLVED EXPENDABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE (EELV). AEW&C SYSTEM

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM EXPENSES DECREASED AS THE EFFORT TRANSITIONED

TO WORK THAT IS SPECIFICALLY REQUIRED FOR THE AUSTRALIAN WEDGETAIL PROGRAM.

COMPANY-SPONSORED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT LEVELS ARE EXPECTED TO DECLINE IN

2003 DUE TO THE TRANSITION OF THE DELTA IV LAUNCH VEHICLE INTO PRODUCTION.

BACKLOG

TOTAL CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG

FOR SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS WAS $14.9 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND $13.1

BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2001 AND $13.7 BILLION AT DECEMBER 31, 2000. SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG INCREASED BY 14% IN 2002 COMPARED TO 2001.

THE 2002 INCREASE IS PRIMARILY DUE TO ORDERS FOR PROPRIETARY PROGRAMS, AN ORDER

BY THE DEPARTMENT OF TRANSPORTATION FOR AIRPORT SECURITY, A NASA AWARD FOR SPACE

FLIGHT PAYLOAD PROCESSING AND ORDERS FOR DELTA IV LAUNCH VEHICLES. THIS INCREASE

WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DECLINES IN COMMERCIAL SATELLITE BACKLOG DUE TO

DECREASES IN NEW ORDERS AND SALES ON EXISTING ORDERS.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

OVERVIEW

SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AS PART OF INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS, WILL SPAN FIVE

DISTINCTIVE MARKETS: INTEGRATED BATTLESPACE, MISSILE DEFENSE, HOMELAND SECURITY,

HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT AND EXPLORATION, AND COMMERCIAL LAUNCH AND SATELLITE. EACH OF

THESE MARKETS HAS UNIQUE CUSTOMERS AND REQUIREMENTS, AND THEREFORE, WILL BE

DISCUSSED INDIVIDUALLY BELOW.

INTEGRATED BATTLESPACE

U.S. MILITARY FORCE STRUCTURE IS SHRINKING,

ITS PLATFORMS ARE AGING, AND THE TEMPO OF OPERATIONS AND ENGAGEMENTS

WORLDWIDE REMAINS HIGH. SEVERAL OF THE RECENT UNITED STATES' MILITARY ACTIONS HAVE DEMONSTRATED THE VALUE OF

SYSTEMS SOLUTIONS THAT ALLOW ALL SYSTEMS TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER; OPERATE OVER LONGER RANGES; AND ARE

UNMANNED AND PROVIDE THE ADVANTAGES OF PRECISION, PERSISTENCE AND SELECTIVE ENGAGEMENT.

REFER TO MILITARY AIRCRAFT

AND MISSILE SYSTEMS BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS BEGINNING ON PAGE 33 FOR

FURTHER DISCUSSION ON MILITARY TRANSFORMATION.

MISSILE DEFENSE

FUNDING FOR THE MISSILE

DEFENSE MARKET IS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MISSILE DEFENSE AGENCY

(MDA) BUDGET. THE PRIMARY THRUSTS IN THIS MARKET ARE THE CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT

AND DEPLOYMENT OF THEATER MISSILE DEFENSE SYSTEMS AND THE GROUND-BASED MISSILE

DEFENSE (GMD) PROGRAM. THE OVERALL MDA MISSILE DEFENSE BUDGET IS APPROXIMATELY

$8 BILLION. THERE IS CONTINUED CONGRESSIONAL SUPPORT FOR DEVELOPMENT OF STRONG

MISSILE DEFENSE CAPABILITIES AS EVIDENCED BY THE FACT THAT THE FISCAL YEAR 2003

BUDGETS WERE FULLY FUNDED IN ALL FOUR DEFENSE COMMITTEES BY CONGRESS.

IN JANUARY 2002, A NEW GMD

PROGRAM STRATEGY WAS RELEASED IN WHICH THE MDA STATED THEIR OBJECTIVE TO PUT A

TEST BED CAPABILITY IN PLACE BY SEPTEMBER 2004. THIS TEST BED WOULD ALLOW

CRITICAL TESTING OF THE GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE SEGMENT ALONG WITH THE

ADDITION OF OTHER SYSTEMS AND SENSORS INTO THE TEST SCENARIO. THESE NEW

REQUIREMENTS FOR A TEST BED AND DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM WERE BASELINED BY THE

COMPANY AND THE U.S. GOVERNMENT IN 2002. THE RESULTING CONTRACT CHANGE WAS

FINALIZED IN DECEMBER 2002. ADDITIONALLY ON DECEMBER 17, 2002, PRESIDENT GEORGE

W. BUSH CALLED FOR OUR NATIONS MISSILE DEFENSE CAPABILITIES TO MOVE FROM

THE TEST ONLY CATEGORY INTO A DEPLOYED SYSTEM. THE COMPANY, IN CONJUNCTION WITH

MDA, HAS INITIATED EFFORTS TO FULFILL THE DIRECTION OF THE PRESIDENT.

THROUGH OUR LEADERSHIP

POSITION ON THE MISSILE DEFENSE NATIONAL TEAM AND OUR PRIME CONTRACTOR ROLE ON

THE GROUND-BASED MIDCOURSE DEFENSE SEGMENT PROGRAM AND ON THE AIRBORNE LASER

PROGRAM, SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS IS POSITIONED TO MAINTAIN ITS ROLE AS

MDAS #1 CONTRACTOR.

- 36 -

HOMELAND SECURITY

SINCE THE EVENTS OF

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE WORLD HAS PERMANENTLY CHANGED. THE PRESIDENT QUICKLY

ISSUED AN EXECUTIVE ORDER ESTABLISHING AN OFFICE OF HOMELAND SECURITY. THIS

OFFICE WAS OFFICIALLY DESIGNATED AS A CABINET LEVEL DEPARTMENT LED BY GOVERNOR

TOM RIDGE ON JANUARY 24, 2003. THIS DEPARTMENT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A BUDGET

OF NEARLY $40 BILLION ANNUALLY WITH A WORKFORCE OF 170,000 CONSOLIDATING FROM 22

DISPARATE AGENCIES. OVER THE PAST YEAR, THE COMPANY HAS ALIGNED INTERNALLY TO

MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE NEW THREAT. IN JUNE 2002, THE COMPANY WAS CHOSEN TO

LEAD THE TEAM THAT INSTALLED EXPLOSIVE DETECTION TECHNOLOGY FOR BAGGAGE

SCREENING IN ALL U.S. AIRPORTS BY DECEMBER 31, 2002. THIS WAS THE LARGEST

HOMELAND SECURITY CONTRACT AWARDED TO DATE, REPRESENTING ONE OF THE LARGEST

SHORT-TERM PROJECTS IN GOVERNMENT HISTORY. THE COMPANY IS FOCUSING ON THE

FEDERAL HOMELAND SECURITY MARKETPLACE, AND WILL LEVERAGE ITS EXPERIENCE AND

CAPABILITIES IN NETWORK CENTRIC OPERATIONS TO ENHANCE THE SOLUTIONS FOR HOMELAND

SECURITY OPPORTUNITIES.

HUMAN SPACE FLIGHT AND EXPLORATION

THE TOTAL HUMAN SPACE

FLIGHT AND EXPLORATION MARKET IS FORECASTED TO BE RELATIVELY FLAT OVER THE NEXT

TEN YEARS. THIS FORECAST IS BASED ON BUDGET PROJECTIONS FOR NASA, THE PRIMARY

CUSTOMER IN THIS MARKET. BUT WITHIN THIS FLAT FORECAST THE COMPANY IS OBSERVING

CHANGES IN DIRECTION AND EMPHASIS WITH THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A NEW VISION AND

MISSION. OVER THE PAST YEAR, NASA HAS DEVELOPED A NEW INTEGRATED SPACE

TRANSPORTATION PLAN (ISTP) TO IMPLEMENT THEIR NEW VISION. THIS PLAN IS DESIGNED

TO BENEFIT THE INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION, SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM, AND THE

AGENCYS SCIENCE AND RESEARCH OBJECTIVES. THE NEW ISTP DEDICATES MORE

RESOURCES TO THE SPACE STATION PROGRAM, PROVIDES ADDITIONAL FUNDING TO EXTEND

THE LIFE AND ENHANCE THE SAFETY AND RELIABILITY OF THE AGENCYS ORBITER

FLEET, BOOSTS FUNDING FOR SCIENCE-BASED PAYLOADS AND RESEARCH, AND RESTRUCTURES

NASAS SPACE LAUNCH INITIATIVE. THE SPACE LAUNCH INITIATIVE WILL NOW FOCUS

ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CREW TRANSPORT VEHICLE TO FERRY SPACE STATION

CREWMEMBERS, ALONG WITH A CONTINUED TECHNOLOGY EFFORT TO IDENTIFY FUTURE

REUSABLE LAUNCH VEHICLE TECHNOLOGIES. THE COMPANY IS WELL POSITIONED TO JOIN

WITH NASA TO HELP REALIZE THEIR VISION USING THE EXPERTISE THE COMPANY HAS

GAINED FROM ITS PRIME CONTRACTOR ROLE ON THE SPACE SHUTTLE PROGRAM AND THE

INTERNATIONAL SPACE STATION AND AN INTEGRAL PLAYER IN THE SPACE LAUNCH

INITIATIVE PROGRAM.

AS NASAS

INVESTIGATION OF THE COLUMBIA ACCIDENT CONTINUES THE COMPANY MAY SEE SOME BUDGET

REPRIORITIZING, BUT IT IS FAR TOO EARLY IN THE INVESTIGATION TO SPECULATE ON

THAT. WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT THIS ADMINISTRATION IS COMMITTED TO FINDING THE

CAUSE OF THE ACCIDENT, FIXING IT, AND SUCCESSFULLY RETURNING THE SPACE SHUTTLE

FLEET BACK TO OPERATIONAL STATUS. WE WILL PARTICIPATE FULLY IN THESE EFFORTS.

COMMERCIAL LAUNCH AND SATELLITE

THE COMMERCIAL MARKET HAS

SOFTENED SIGNIFICANTLY SINCE THE LATE 1990S IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DOWNTURN IN

THE TELECOMMUNICATIONS INDUSTRY. THESE MARKETS ARE NOW CHARACTERIZED BY

OVERCAPACITY, COMMODITY PRICING AND LIMITED NEAR TERM OPPORTUNITIES. THE

RECOVERY IN THE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE MARKET MAY TAKE SEVERAL YEARS AT WHICH TIME

WE BELIEVE THE MARKET WILL STABILIZE IN THE 15-20 SATELLITES PER YEAR RANGE.

THIS RECOVERY IN SATELLITE ORDERS SHOULD ALSO PRODUCE NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN THE

LAUNCH SERVICES BUSINESS. WE HAVE TAKEN AGGRESSIVE ACTIONS TO RIGHT SIZE AND

RESTRUCTURE OUR ORGANIZATIONS TO MEET THE FUTURE COMMERCIAL DEMAND, WHILE

CONTINUING TO MEET OUR GOVERNMENT CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS. IN ADDITION, WE HAVE

WORKED DILIGENTLY OVER THE LAST YEAR TO IMPROVE PROCESSES IN OUR QUALITY,

ENGINEERING AND MANUFACTURING DISCIPLINES. WE BELIEVE BOEING SATELLITE SYSTEMS

AND BOEING LAUNCH SERVICES (DELTA II, III, IV AND SEA LAUNCH) ARE POSITIONED TO

BRING UNIQUE AND COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS TO OUR COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS AS THEIR

REQUIREMENTS FOR NEW OR REPLACEMENT SATELLITES RESURFACES.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT FINANCING. INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEBT

IS NOT INCLUDED IN BCCS OPERATING EARNINGS AS THE COMPANY REPORTS INTEREST

EXPENSE BELOW OPERATING EARNINGS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

HOWEVER, INTEREST EXPENSE OF $410 MILLION, $324 MILLION, AND $229 MILLION WAS

ASSOCIATED WITH DEBT RELATING TO BCC FINANCING ACTIVITIES FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001 AND 2000. BEGINNING IN 2003, INTEREST EXPENSE WILL BE

REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OPERATING EARNINGS FOR BCC.

- 37 -

OPERATING REVENUES FOR BCC

WERE $994 MILLION IN 2002, COMPARED WITH $815 MILLION IN 2001 AND $545 MILLION

IN 2000. A LARGER PORTFOLIO, RESULTING FROM NEW BUSINESS VOLUME AND PORTFOLIO

TRANSFERS FROM BOEING OVER THE LAST TWO YEARS, IS PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

INCREASED REVENUES IN 2002 AND 2001.

OPERATING EARNINGS

OPERATING EARNINGS FOR BCC

WERE $482 MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, COMPARED WITH $562

MILLION FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY

ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE IMPAIRMENT AND VALUATION ALLOWANCE CHARGES RECOGNIZED IN

2002, OFFSET BY ADDITIONAL INCOME DUE TO THE GROWTH IN THE PORTFOLIO. OPERATING

EARNINGS FOR 2001 WERE $562 MILLION COMPARED WITH $397 MILLION IN 2000. THE

GROWTH IN INVESTMENT IN FINANCING ASSETS WAS PRINCIPALLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

INCREASE. THE INCREASE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY HIGHER PROVISION FOR LOSSES, AND

HIGHER OPERATING AND OTHER EXPENSES.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED A PRE-TAX EXPENSE OF $426 MILLION

PRIMARILY IN RECOGNITION OF THE DETERIORATION OF AIRCRAFT VALUES AND CUSTOMER

CREDIT RATINGS. TOTAL IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE RECOGNIZED IN 2001 AND 2000 WAS NOT

A SPECIFIC PRE-TAX

IMPAIRMENT OF $79 MILLION WAS RECORDED DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2002 RELATED

TO A LONG-HELD INVESTMENT IN ETCS SECURED BY AIRCRAFT ON LEASE TO UNITED

AIRLINES (UNITED). THE WRITE-DOWN WAS BASED ON THE DECLINE IN CREDIT

RATINGS OF UNITED, THE LONG-TERM MATURITY OF THE INVESTMENT AND THE DECLINE IN

THE UNDERLYING AIRCRAFT COLLATERAL VALUATIONS. THE ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF THIS

INVESTMENT WILL DEPEND UPON LEGAL DEVELOPMENTS IN UNITEDS BANKRUPTCY

PROCEEDINGS AND UNITEDS ABILITY TO MEET ITS RELATED CONTRACTUAL

OBLIGATIONS.

A SPECIFIC PRE-TAX

IMPAIRMENT OF $48 MILLION WAS RECORDED RELATED TO A JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENT

THAT WAS ESTABLISHED TO LEASE AND EVENTUALLY CONVERT 24 727 PASSENGER AIRCRAFT

TO FULL CARGO CONFIGURATION. BASED ON THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT OF CURRENT

MARKET CONDITIONS AND THE AVERAGE AGE OF THE AIRCRAFT (AVERAGING OVER TWENTY

YEARS OLD), THE COMPANY RECORDED AN IMPAIRMENT FOR ITS SHARE OF THE ADJUSTMENT

TO ESTIMATED FAIR MARKET VALUE FOR THE JOINT VENTURES 727 AIRCRAFT. THE

BCC PORTFOLIO DOES NOT INCLUDE ANY 727 AIRCRAFT OTHER THAN THOSE HELD THROUGH

THIS JOINT VENTURE.

OTHER PRE-TAX CHARGES OF

$119 MILLION RELATED TO VALUATIONS OF OTHER ASSETS IN THE PORTFOLIO DURING THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002. INCLUDED IN THIS AMOUNT WAS A $66 MILLION

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECORDED DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2002 ON THE RETURN OF 24

717S TO THE COMPANY BY AMR CORPORATION.

THE TOTAL BCC PORTFOLIO WAS

$11.8 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, COMPARED WITH $9.2 BILLION AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2001. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, BCCS DEBT-TO-EQUITY RATIO WAS 5.7-TO-1,

COMPARED WITH 5.3-TO-1 AT DECEMBER 31, 2001.

BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT AND TRENDS

BCC ACTS AS A CAPTIVE

FINANCE SUBSIDIARY FOR THE COMPANY AND PROVIDES MARKET-BASED LEASE AND LOAN

FINANCING PRIMARILY TO AIRLINES THAT PURCHASE OR LEASE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT

MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY OR OTHERS. BCC COMPETES FOR AIRCRAFT FINANCE

BUSINESS WITH OTHER FINANCE COMPANIES, COMMERCIAL BANKS, INSURANCE COMPANIES AND

OTHER FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS.

BCC ALSO COMPETES IN THE

COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT LEASING AND FINANCE MARKETS, PRIMARILY IN THE UNITED

STATES, AGAINST A NUMBER OF LARGE TICKET COMPETITORS, MAINLY HEAVILY CAPITALIZED

LEASING COMPANIES AND RELATIONSHIP BANKS. APPROXIMATELY 22% OF BCCS

PORTFOLIO HAS BEEN GENERATED FROM COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT LEASING AND FINANCING

ACTIVITIES. COMMERCIAL EQUIPMENT CONSISTS OF EXECUTIVE AIRCRAFT, MACHINE TOOLS

AND PRODUCTION EQUIPMENT, CONTAINERS AND MARINE EQUIPMENT, CHEMICAL, OIL AND GAS

EQUIPMENT AND OTHER EQUIPMENT. NEW BUSINESS VOLUME OF BCC IS FUNDED WITH DEBT

OBTAINED IN THE CAPITAL MARKETS, CASH FROM OPERATIONS, AND CONTRIBUTIONS FROM

THE COMPANY.

- 38 -

PUBLISHED SOURCES AND

RECENT MARKET TRANSACTIONS INDICATE THAT VALUES FOR VARIOUS AIRCRAFT TYPES USED

AS COLLATERAL IN BCCS PORTFOLIO REMAINED DEPRESSED. AT THE SAME TIME, THE

CREDIT RATINGS OF MANY AIRLINES, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES, HAVE

CONTINUED TO DETERIORATE. A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF BCCS PORTFOLIO IS

CONCENTRATED AMONG COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS. CERTAIN CUSTOMERS HAVE FILED

FOR BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION OR REQUESTED LEASE OR LOAN RESTRUCTURINGS; THESE

NEGOTIATIONS WERE IN VARIOUS STAGES AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. THESE BANKRUPTCIES

OR RESTRUCTURINGS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS

EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

UNITED FILED FOR

CHAPTER 11 BANKRUPTCY PROTECTION ON DECEMBER 9, 2002. AS OF THE FILING

DATE, THE COMPANY HAS NOT REACHED AGREEMENT WITH UNITED ON A RESTRUCTURING OF

ITS VARIOUS TRANSACTIONS. FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS MAY RESULT IN CHANGES TO THE

AGREEMENTS UNDER WHICH UNITED HAS AGREED TO PERFORM. SO LONG AS UNITED REMAINS

IN BANKRUPTCY, UNITED HAS THE RIGHT TO REJECT OR ABANDON ITS TRANSACTION WITH

THE COMPANY. IN THE EVENT THAT FUTURE NEGOTIATIONS OR PROCEEDINGS RESULT IN THE

RETURN OF A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT, THERE COULD BE A MATERIAL ADVERSE

EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS OR FINANCIAL POSITION AT LEAST

UNTIL SUCH TIME AS THE AIRCRAFT ARE SOLD OR REDEPLOYED FOR ADEQUATE

CONSIDERATION.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

THERE WERE $311 MILLION OF ASSETS, PRINCIPALLY COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT THAT WERE

HELD FOR SALE OR RE-LEASE AT BCC, OF WHICH $308 MILLION WERE NOT YET IDENTIFIED

WITH A FIRM CONTRACT TO SELL OR PLACE ON LEASE. ADDITIONALLY, APPROXIMATELY $207

MILLION OF BCCS ASSETS ARE CURRENTLY SCHEDULED TO COME OFF LEASE IN 2003.

THE INABILITY OF BCC TO SELL SUCH ASSETS OR PLACE SUCH ASSETS INTO

REVENUE-GENERATING SERVICE COULD POSE A POTENTIAL RISK TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

SHOULD SOME OF THESE ASSETS BE DEEMED TO BE IMPAIRED.

AIRLINES REGULARLY UTILIZE

A SPECIAL PURPOSE ENTITY (SPE) KNOWN AS A PASS THROUGH TRUST. THE PASS THROUGH

TRUST ENABLES THE AIRLINE TO AGGREGATE A LARGE NUMBER OF AIRCRAFT SECURED NOTES

INTO ONE TRUST VEHICLE, FACILITATING THE ISSUANCE OF LARGER BONDS CALLED PASS

THROUGH CERTIFICATES (PTCS). THE MOST COMMON FORM OF PTCS ISSUED BY AIRLINES IS

THE EETCS. EETCS PROVIDE INVESTORS WITH TRANCHED RIGHTS TO CASH FLOWS FROM A

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENT, AS WELL AS A COLLATERAL POSITION IN THE RELATED ASSET.

WHILE THE UNDERLYING CLASSES OF EQUIPMENT NOTES VARY BY MATURITY AND/OR COUPON

DEPENDING UPON TENOR OR LEVEL OF SUBORDINATION OF THE SPECIFIC EQUIPMENT NOTES

AND THEIR CORRESPONDING CLAIM ON THE AIRCRAFT, THE BASIC FUNCTION OF THE PASS

THROUGH TRUST IN AN EETC REMAINS: TO PASSIVELY HOLD SEPARATE DEBT INVESTMENTS TO

ENHANCE LIQUIDITY FOR INVESTORS, WHOM IN TURN PASS THIS LIQUIDITY BENEFIT

DIRECTLY TO THE AIRLINE IN THE FORM OF LOWER COUPON AND/OR GREATER DEBT

CAPACITY. BCC PARTICIPATES IN SEVERAL EETCS AS AN INVESTOR. THE EETC INVESTMENTS

ARE RELATED TO CUSTOMERS THE COMPANY BELIEVES HAVE LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE

CREDIT.

BCC ALSO UTILIZES CERTAIN

SPES TO ISOLATE INDIVIDUAL TRANSACTIONS FOR LEGAL LIABILITY, PERFECT SECURITY

INTEREST FROM THE PERSPECTIVE OF THE COMPANY AND A THIRD-PARTY LENDER IN CERTAIN

LEVERAGED TRANSACTIONS, AND REALIZE CERTAIN INCOME AND SALES TAX BENEFITS. THESE

SPES ARE FULLY CONSOLIDATED IN THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2002, BCC

COMPLETED AN ASSET SECURITIZATION THAT RAISED $299 MILLION OF SECURED DEBT

THROUGH THE USE OF A BANK-SPONSORED COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT (C/P CONDUIT). AS

COLLATERAL FOR THE DEBT, BCC TRANSFERRED $331 MILLION OF ASSETS FROM ITS

PORTFOLIO TO THE C/P CONDUIT. THESE PORTFOLIO ASSETS CONSISTED OF THE CASH FLOWS

ASSOCIATED WITH SPECIFIC FINANCING LEASES, NOTES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND

OPERATING LEASES. BCC ALSO ASSIGNED TO THE C/P CONDUIT PERFECTED SECURITY

INTERESTS IN $278 MILLION OF COLLATERAL UNDERLYING THE TRANSFERRED PORTFOLIO

ASSETS. THE COLLATERAL PLEDGED INDIRECTLY PROVIDES THE C/P CONDUIT WITH

ADDITIONAL PROTECTION IN THE EVENT THAT THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE LEASES AND NOTES

ARE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE TOTAL DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TRANSACTION. THE

SECURED DEBT AND SECURITIZED ASSETS REMAIN ON BCCS BALANCE SHEET.

OTHER

OTHER SEGMENT EARNINGS WERE

$(424) MILLION IN 2002, $(354) MILLION IN 2001, AND $43 MILLION IN 2000. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, OPERATING EARNINGS OF $44 MILLION AND $23 MILLION

WERE ATTRIBUTABLE TO FOUR C-17 TRANSPORT AIRCRAFT ON LEASE TO THE UNITED KINGDOM

ROYAL AIR FORCE. THESE LEASES BEGAN IN 2001. OFFSETTING THE OPERATING EARNINGS

OF THE C-17 LEASES WERE INCREASES IN LOSSES DURING BOTH 2002 AND 2001 PRIMARILY

DUE TO INCREASES IN INTERCOMPANY GUARANTEES AND ASSET IMPAIRMENTS, LEASE

ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES AND OTHER SUBSIDIES RELATED TO BCC. SEE NOTE 24. RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE OTHER SEGMENT WAS $129 MILLION IN

2002, $294 MILLION IN 2001, AND $84 MILLION IN 2000. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

ACTIVITIES IN THE OTHER SEGMENT RELATE PRIMARILY TO CONNEXION BY

BOEING

SM

AND, TO A LESSER EXTENT, AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT.

ASTRO LTD., A WHOLLY-OWNED

SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY, OPERATES AS A CAPTIVE INSURANCE COMPANY. THIS

SUBSIDIARY ENABLES THE COMPANYS EXPOSURES TO BE INSURED AT THE LOWEST

POSSIBLE COST TO THE COMPANY REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THE MARKET IS OVERPRICED. IN

ADDITION, IT PROVIDES FLEXIBILITY TO THE COMPANY IN HANDLING ITS CHANGING RISK

FINANCING NEEDS AND PROVIDES ACCESS TO THE REINSURANCE MARKETS. CURRENTLY, ASTRO

LTD. INSURES AVIATION LIABILITY, WORKERS COMPENSATION, GENERAL LIABILITY,

PROPERTY, AS WELL AS VARIOUS SMALLER RISK LIABILITY INSURANCES.

EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001

ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE UNITED

STATES WAS THE TARGET OF SEVERE TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT INVOLVED THE USE OF U.S.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY.  THESE ATTACKS RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF LIFE AND

PROPERTY AND CAUSED MAJOR DISRUPTIONS IN BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND IN THE U.S. ECONOMY OVERALL. SEE NOTE 3.

EMPLOYEES AND LABOR RELATIONS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WERE WITH THE

INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS AND AEROSPACE WORKERS (IAM) REPRESENTING

20% OF EMPLOYEES (CURRENT AGREEMENTS EXPIRING IN MAY 2004, AND SEPTEMBER AND

OCTOBER 2005); THE SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING EMPLOYEES IN AEROSPACE

(SPEEA) REPRESENTING 13% OF EMPLOYEES (CURRENT AGREEMENTS EXPIRING FEBRUARY 2004

AND DECEMBER 2005); AND THE UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE AND AGRICULTURAL

IMPLEMENT WORKERS OF AMERICA (UAW) REPRESENTING 4% OF EMPLOYEES (CURRENT

AGREEMENTS EXPIRING MAY 2003, APRIL 2004, AND SEPTEMBER 2005).

THE COMPANYS

WORKFORCE LEVEL WAS 166,000 AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

CONTINGENT ITEMS

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS,

CLAIMS AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS, CONTRACTS AND OTHER MATTERS ARE

PENDING AGAINST THE COMPANY. MOST SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO

MATTERS COVERED BY INSURANCE. MAJOR CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING

THOSE FOR DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED

SITES. DUE IN PART TO THEIR COMPLEXITY AND PERVASIVENESS, SUCH REQUIREMENTS HAVE

RESULTED IN THE COMPANY BEING INVOLVED WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS

AND REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS SINCE THE 1980S.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY

ASSESSES, BASED ON IN-DEPTH STUDIES, EXPERT ANALYSES AND LEGAL REVIEWS, ITS

CONTINGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED

SITES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RANGES AND PROBABILITIES OF RECOVERIES FROM

OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO HAVE AND HAVE NOT AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT AND OF

RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS. THE COMPANYS POLICY IS TO IMMEDIATELY

ACCRUE AND CHARGE TO CURRENT EXPENSE IDENTIFIED EXPOSURES RELATED TO

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SITES BASED ON ESTIMATES OF INVESTIGATION, CLEANUP AND

MONITORING COSTS TO BE INCURRED.

THE COSTS INCURRED AND

EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT HAD, AND ARE

NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION. WITH RESPECT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, RELATED CHARGES HAVE AVERAGED

LESS THAN 2% OF ANNUAL NET EARNINGS. SUCH ACCRUALS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR THE RELATED CONTINGENT RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE

CARRIERS, ARE LESS THAN 2% OF TOTAL LIABILITIES.

BECAUSE OF THE REGULATORY

COMPLEXITIES AND RISK OF UNIDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED SITES AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE

POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

FROM THE ESTIMATED COSTS ACCRUED FOR IDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED SITES. HOWEVER,

BASED ON ALL KNOWN FACTS AND EXPERT ANALYSES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS NOT

REASONABLY LIKELY THAT IDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES WILL RESULT IN

ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION OR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOW TRENDS.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS FROM WHICH CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE

PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT. SUCH PROCEEDINGS COULD INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE

GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES, COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION

AND/OR FORFEITURES. UNDER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, A COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF

ITS OPERATING DIVISIONS OR SUBDIVISIONS, CAN ALSO BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, OR LOSE ITS EXPORT PRIVILEGES, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF

INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES, BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT

THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH GOVERNMENT DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION OR CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

IN 1991, THE U.S. NAVY

NOTIFIED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS (NOW A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY) AND GENERAL

DYNAMICS CORPORATION (THE TEAM) THAT IT WAS TERMINATING FOR DEFAULT

THE TEAMS CONTRACT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE A-12

AIRCRAFT. THE TEAM FILED A LEGAL ACTION TO CONTEST THE NAVYS DEFAULT

TERMINATION, TO ASSERT ITS RIGHTS TO CONVERT THE TERMINATION TO ONE FOR

THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND TO OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR WORK

DONE AND COSTS INCURRED ON THE A-12 CONTRACT BUT NOT PAID TO DATE. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002, INVENTORIES INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $583 MILLION OF RECORDED

COSTS ON THE A-12 CONTRACT, AGAINST WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A LOSS

PROVISION OF $350 MILLION. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVISION, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN

1990, WAS BASED ON MCDONNELL DOUGLASS BELIEF, SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF

OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WOULD BE CONVERTED TO A

TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE, AND THAT THE BEST ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE LOSS ON

TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE WAS $350 MILLION.

- 40 -

ON AUGUST 31, 2001, THE

U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ISSUED A DECISION AFTER TRIAL UPHOLDING THE U.S.

GOVERNMENTS DEFAULT TERMINATION OF THE A-12 CONTRACT ON THE GROUNDS THAT

THE TEAM COULD NOT MEET THE REVISED CONTRACT SCHEDULE UNILATERALLY IMPOSED BY

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THIS FOLLOWED AN EARLIER TRIAL COURT DECISION IN FAVOR

OF THE CONTRACTORS AND REVERSAL OF THAT INITIAL DECISION ON APPEAL. THE

TEAM APPEALED THAT DECISION TO THE COURT OF APPEALS AND IS AWAITING A DECISION.

THE TEAM ALSO OBTAINED A STAY OF THE TRIAL COURTS JUDGMENT TO PREVENT THE

NAVY FROM COLLECTING ANY AMOUNTS PRIOR TO THE DECISION BY THE COURT OF APPEALS.

IF, AFTER ALL JUDICIAL

PROCEEDINGS HAVE ENDED, THE COURTS DETERMINE THAT A TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WAS

APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANY WOULD INCUR AN ADDITIONAL LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $275

MILLION, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF REMAINING INVENTORY COSTS AND ADJUSTMENTS,

AND WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ONE-HALF OF THE UNLIQUIDATED

PROGRESS PAYMENTS OF $1,350 MILLION PLUS STATUTORY INTEREST FROM FEBRUARY 1991

(CURRENTLY TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $1,040 MILLION). THE LOSS TO THE COMPANY WOULD

TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $1,465 MILLION IN PRE-TAX CHARGES.

ALTHOUGH THE COURT OF

FEDERAL CLAIMS SUSTAINED THE DEFAULT TERMINATION IN 2001, THE COMPANY BELIEVES

THAT THE COURTS RULING IS CONTRARY TO LAW AND FACT AND THAT THE LOSS

PROVISION ESTABLISHED BY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS IN 1990 CONTINUES TO PROVIDE

ADEQUATELY FOR THE REASONABLY POSSIBLE REDUCTION IN VALUE OF A-12 NET CONTRACTS

IN PROCESS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE A-12 LITIGATION WILL

DEPEND UPON THE OUTCOME OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS OR POSSIBLE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT.

THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT

IN SEVEN EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION MATTERS IN WHICH CLASS CERTIFICATION IS

SOUGHT OR HAS BEEN GRANTED.  THESE MATTERS ARE PENDING IN SEATTLE, LOS

ANGELES, ST. LOUIS, TULSA, AND WICHITA.  THE COMPANY INTENDS TO

CONTINUE ITS AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE OF THESE CASES. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT

WHAT IMPACT, IF ANY, THESE CASES COULD HAVE ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE

DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK

INTEREST RATE RISK

THE COMPANY HAS FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK, PRINCIPALLY SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS, FIXED-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS, AND CUSTOMER FINANCING ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES. HISTORICALLY, THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED MATERIAL GAINS OR

LOSSES DUE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANY USES INTEREST

RATE SWAPS TO MANAGE EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE CHANGES.

BASED ON THE CURRENT

HOLDINGS OF SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS RELATED SWAPS, THE UNHEDGED

EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IS NOT MATERIAL FOR THESE INSTRUMENTS. FIXED-RATE

DEBT OBLIGATIONS ISSUED BY THE COMPANY ARE GENERALLY NOT PUTTABLE UNTIL MATURITY

AND ARE NOT ACTIVELY TRADED BY THE COMPANY IN THE MARKET. THEREFORE, EXPOSURE TO

INTEREST RATE RISK IS NOT BELIEVED TO BE MATERIAL FOR THE COMPANYS

FIXED-RATE DEBT.

BOEING CAPITAL

CORPORATIONS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, BOTH FIXED-RATE AND FLOATING-RATE,

MAY BE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK TO THE EXTENT THAT THE MATURITIES AND

REPRICING CHARACTERISTICS OF THE LIABILITIES DO NOT PERFECTLY MATCH THOSE OF THE

ASSETS. THE TYPES AND TERMS OF BORROWING AND HEDGING INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE

AVAILABLE TO BCC IN THE MARKET AND POSSIBLE CHANGES IN ASSET TERMS LIMIT

BCCS ABILITY TO MATCH ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. BCC ATTEMPTS TO KEEP THIS

MISMATCH RISK SMALL, PARTLY THROUGH THE USE OF INTEREST RATE SWAPS, AND DOES NOT

BELIEVE IT IS MATERIALLY EXPOSED TO GAINS OR LOSSES DUE TO INTEREST RATE

CHANGES.

BCC HAS USED PUBLIC MARKET

INFORMATION AND COMMON VALUATION METHODS TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF ITS

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. THE ESTIMATES ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF THE

AMOUNTS BCC COULD REALIZE IN A CURRENT MARKET EXCHANGE, AND THE USE OF DIFFERENT

ASSUMPTIONS OR VALUATION METHODS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE ESTIMATED

FAIR VALUE AMOUNTS.

- 41 -

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE

BOOK VALUES OF BCCS ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE APPROXIMATELY $13 BILLION

AND $11 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. BCC USES DURATION GAP ANALYSIS TO ESTIMATE THE

IMPACT OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. POTENTIAL CHANGES IN TWELVE-MONTH NET

INTEREST INCOME AND IN THE CURRENT DISCOUNTED VALUE OF THE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE CALCULATED BASED ON THE AMOUNT AND TIMING OF CASH FLOWS

PROJECTED FROM EACH. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THAT IF MARKET

INTEREST RATES FOR ALL MATURITIES WERE AFFECTED BY AN IMMEDIATE, ONE-TIME,

100-BASIS-POINT INCREASE, BCCS NET EARNINGS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT INCREASES

IN BOTH REVENUE AND INTEREST EXPENSE, WOULD HAVE INCREASED BY AN AMOUNT THAT IS

IMMATERIAL TO THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. ADDITIONALLY, ALTHOUGH THE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES IMPACTED BY A CHANGE IN INTEREST RATES ARE GENERALLY NOT TRADED, BCC

ESTIMATED THAT THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WOULD HAVE

CHANGED BY AN AMOUNT THAT IS IMMATERIAL TO ITS FINANCIAL POSITION.

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATE RISK RELATING TO RECEIPTS FROM CUSTOMERS AND

PAYMENTS TO SUPPLIERS IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES. THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY

FORWARD CONTRACTS AND OPTIONS FROM TIME TO TIME TO HEDGE THE PRICE RISK

ASSOCIATED WITH FIRMLY COMMITTED AND FORECASTED FOREIGN DENOMINATED PAYMENTS AND

RECEIPTS RELATED TO ITS ONGOING BUSINESS AND OPERATIONAL FINANCING ACTIVITIES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS ARE SENSITIVE TO CHANGES IN FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES. AT DECEMBER 31, 2002, A 10% UNFAVORABLE EXCHANGE RATE MOVEMENT IN THE

COMPANYS PORTFOLIO OF FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS WOULD HAVE

RESULTED IN AN INCREMENTAL UNREALIZED LOSS OF $30 MILLION. CONSISTENT WITH THE

USE OF THESE CONTRACTS TO NEUTRALIZE THE EFFECT OF EXCHANGE RATE FLUCTUATIONS,

SUCH UNREALIZED LOSSES OR GAINS WOULD BE OFFSET BY CORRESPONDING GAINS OR

LOSSES, RESPECTIVELY, IN THE REMEASUREMENT OF THE UNDERLYING TRANSACTIONS BEING

HEDGED. WHEN TAKEN TOGETHER, THESE FORWARD CONTRACTS AND THE OFFSETTING

UNDERLYING COMMITMENTS DO NOT CREATE MATERIAL MARKET RISK.

COMMODITY PRICE RISK

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

COMMODITY PRICE RISK RELATING PRINCIPALLY TO ENERGY USED IN PRODUCTION. THE

COMPANY PERIODICALLY USES COMMODITY DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS FIXED-PRICE PURCHASE

COMMITMENTS, TO HEDGE AGAINST POTENTIALLY UNFAVORABLE PRICE CHANGES OF

COMMODITIES. COMMODITY PRICE EXPOSURE RELATED TO UNHEDGED CONTRACTS IS NOT

MATERIAL.

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001, AND 2000

(DOLLARS IN MILLIONS EXCEPT PER SHARE DATA)

NOTE 1 -

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OF THE BOEING COMPANY, TOGETHER WITH ITS SUBSIDIARIES (HEREIN

REFERRED TO AS THE COMPANY) INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF ALL

MAJORITY-OWNED SUBSIDIARIES. INVESTMENTS IN JOINT VENTURES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY

DOES NOT HAVE CONTROL, BUT HAS THE ABILITY TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE

OVER THE OPERATING AND FINANCIAL POLICIES, ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE EQUITY

METHOD. ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANYS SHARE OF NET EARNINGS AND LOSSES FROM

THESE VENTURES IS INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

INTERCOMPANY PROFITS, TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED IN

CONSOLIDATION. CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE TO PRIOR PERIODS TO

CONFORM WITH CURRENT REPORTING.

USE OF ESTIMATES

THE PREPARATION OF

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED

IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ASSUMPTIONS AND

ESTIMATES THAT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE AMOUNTS REPORTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES FOR WHICH CHANGES IN THE NEAR TERM

ARE CONSIDERED REASONABLY POSSIBLE AND THAT MAY HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE ADDRESSED IN THESE NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

OPERATING CYCLE

FOR CLASSIFICATION OF

CURRENT ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, THE COMPANY ELECTED TO USE THE DURATION OF THE

CONTRACT AS ITS OPERATING CYCLE.

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING IS USED

PREDOMINATELY BY THE MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS AND SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENTS. THE MAJORITY OF THE BUSINESS CONDUCTED IN THESE

SEGMENTS IS PERFORMED UNDER CONTRACTS FOR THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN

GOVERNMENTS THAT EXTEND OVER A NUMBER OF YEARS.

THE PROCESS TO ESTIMATE THE

TOTAL CONTRACT COST-REVENUE RELATIONSHIP RESULTS IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF GROSS

MARGIN AND COST OF SALES PERCENTAGES. THESE PERCENTAGES ARE UTILIZED IN THE

RECOGNITION OF EARNINGS AND ARE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS IN CONTRACT ACCOUNTING. THE

AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF

SALES PERCENTAGES TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED FOR EACH CONTRACT.

REVENUES UNDER CONTRACTS

WITH FIXED PRICES ARE GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS DELIVERIES ARE MADE. FOR CERTAIN

FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS THAT REQUIRE SUBSTANTIAL PERFORMANCE OVER AN EXTENDED

PERIOD BEFORE DELIVERIES BEGIN, REVENUES ARE RECORDED BASED ON THE ATTAINMENT OF

PERFORMANCE MILESTONES. REVENUES UNDER CONTRACTS WITH TERMS THAT REIMBURSE FOR

COSTS INCURRED PLUS AN AGREED UPON PROFIT ARE RECORDED AS COSTS ARE INCURRED.

CONTRACTS MAY CONTAIN PROVISIONS TO EARN INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES IF TARGETS ARE

ACHIEVED. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED ARE RECORDED

OVER THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD OF THE CONTRACT. INCENTIVE AND AWARD FEES THAT

CANNOT BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED ARE RECORDED WHEN AWARDED.

- 47 -

PROGRAM ACCOUNTING

THE COMPANY USES PROGRAM

ACCOUNTING FOR ITS 7-SERIES COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAMS. PROGRAM ACCOUNTING IS

A METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS MANUFACTURED FOR

DELIVERY UNDER PRODUCTION TYPE CONTRACTS WHERE PROFITABILITY IS REALIZED OVER

MULTIPLE CONTRACTS AND YEARS. UNDER PROGRAM ACCOUNTING, INVENTORIABLE PRODUCTION

COSTS (INCLUDING OVERHEAD), PROGRAM TOOLING COSTS AND WARRANTY COSTS ARE

ACCUMULATED AND CHARGED TO REVENUE BY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF BY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR

CONTRACTS. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING

QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION

EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS. TO ESTABLISH THE

RELATIONSHIP OF REVENUE TO COST OF SALES, PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES ESTIMATES

OF (A) THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN A PROGRAM, (B) THE PERIOD

OVER WHICH THE UNITS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED, AND (C) THEIR

EXPECTED SELLING PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING, AND WARRANTY COSTS

FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES

REVENUE FOR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES WHEN A UNIT IS COMPLETED AND ACCEPTED BY THE

CUSTOMER. THE REVENUE RECOGNIZED IS THE PRICE NEGOTIATED WITH THE CUSTOMER

INCLUDING SPECIAL FEATURES ADJUSTED BY AN ESCALATION FORMULA. THE AMOUNT

REPORTED AS COST OF SALES IS DETERMINED BY APPLYING THE ESTIMATED COST OF SALES

PERCENTAGE FOR THE TOTAL REMAINING PROGRAM TO THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNIZED

FOR THE QUARTER.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIED COSTS ON

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND LONG-TERM CONTRACTS INCLUDE DIRECT ENGINEERING,

PRODUCTION AND TOOLING COSTS, AND APPLICABLE OVERHEAD, NOT IN EXCESS OF

ESTIMATED NET REALIZABLE VALUE. IN ACCORDANCE WITH INDUSTRY PRACTICE,

INVENTORIED COSTS INCLUDE AMOUNTS RELATING TO PROGRAMS AND CONTRACTS WITH LONG

PRODUCTION CYCLES, A PORTION OF WHICH IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE REALIZED WITHIN ONE

YEAR.

BECAUSE OF THE HIGHER UNIT

PRODUCTION COSTS EXPERIENCED AT THE BEGINNING OF A NEW AIRPLANE PROGRAM (KNOWN

AS THE LEARNING CURVE EFFECT) AND THE SUBSTANTIAL INVESTMENT REQUIRED FOR

INITIAL TOOLING AND SPECIAL EQUIPMENT, THE COSTS INCURRED FOR PRODUCTION OF THE

EARLY UNITS IN THE PROGRAM WILL EXCEED THE AMOUNT REPORTED AS COST OF SALES FOR

THOSE UNITS. THIS DIFFERENCE KNOWN AS DEFERRED PRODUCTION COSTS IS INCLUDED IN

INVENTORY ALONG WITH UNAMORTIZED TOOLING COSTS.

COMMERCIAL SPARE PARTS AND

GENERAL STOCK MATERIALS ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST NOT IN EXCESS OF NET

REALIZABLE VALUE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED UNLESS THE COSTS ARE RELATED TO A CONTRACTUAL

ARRANGEMENT. COSTS THAT ARE INCURRED PURSUANT TO A CONTRACTUAL ARRANGEMENT ARE

RECORDED AS INVENTORY COSTS AND CHARGED TO COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES UNDER

CONTRACT ACCOUNTING.

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

THE COMPANY USES A FAIR

VALUE BASED METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION PROVIDED TO ITS

EMPLOYEES IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS)

NO. 123,

ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

. THE COMPANY VALUES

STOCK OPTIONS ISSUED BASED UPON AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL AND RECOGNIZES THIS

VALUE AS AN EXPENSE OVER THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE OPTIONS VEST. POTENTIAL

DISTRIBUTIONS FROM THE SHAREVALUE TRUST DESCRIBED IN NOTE 17 HAVE BEEN VALUED

BASED UPON AN OPTION-PRICING MODEL, WITH THE RELATED EXPENSE RECOGNIZED OVER THE

LIFE OF THE TRUST. SHARE-BASED EXPENSE ASSOCIATED WITH PERFORMANCE SHARES

DESCRIBED IN NOTE 17 IS DETERMINED BASED ON THE MARKET VALUE OF THE

COMPANYS STOCK AT THE TIME OF THE AWARD APPLIED TO THE MAXIMUM NUMBER OF

SHARES CONTINGENTLY ISSUABLE BASED ON STOCK PRICE AND IS AMORTIZED OVER A

FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.

INCOME TAXES

PROVISIONS FOR FEDERAL,

STATE AND FOREIGN INCOME TAXES ARE CALCULATED ON REPORTED FINANCIAL STATEMENT

PRE-TAX INCOME BASED ON CURRENT TAX LAW AND ALSO INCLUDE, IN THE CURRENT PERIOD,

THE CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ANY CHANGES IN TAX RATES FROM THOSE USED PREVIOUSLY IN

DETERMINING DEFERRED TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. SUCH PROVISIONS DIFFER FROM THE

AMOUNTS CURRENTLY PAYABLE BECAUSE CERTAIN ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE

RECOGNIZED IN DIFFERENT TIME PERIODS FOR FINANCIAL REPORTING PURPOSES THAN FOR

INCOME TAX PURPOSES.

POSTRETIREMENT PLANS

THE COMPANY SPONSORS

VARIOUS PENSION PLANS COVERING SUBSTANTIALLY ALL EMPLOYEES. THE COMPANY ALSO

PROVIDES POSTRETIREMENT BENEFIT PLANS OTHER THAN PENSIONS, CONSISTING

PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE, TO ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING

DEPENDENTS. THE LIABILITIES AND ANNUAL INCOME OR EXPENSE OF THE COMPANYS

PENSION AND OTHER POSTRETIREMENT PLANS ARE DETERMINED USING METHODOLOGIES THAT

INVOLVE SEVERAL ACTUARIAL ASSUMPTIONS, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH ARE THE

DISCOUNT RATE, THE LONG-TERM RATE OF ASSET RETURN, AND MEDICAL TREND (RATE OF

GROWTH FOR MEDICAL COSTS). NOT ALL NET PERIODIC PENSION INCOME OR EXPENSE IS

RECOGNIZED IN NET EARNINGS IN THE YEAR INCURRED BECAUSE IT IS ALLOCATED TO

PRODUCTION AS PRODUCT COSTS, AND A PORTION REMAINS IN INVENTORY AT THE END OF A

REPORTING PERIOD.

THE COMPANYS FUNDING

POLICY FOR PENSION PLANS IS TO CONTRIBUTE, AT A MINIMUM, THE STATUTORILY

REQUIRED AMOUNT TO AN IRREVOCABLE TRUST. BENEFITS UNDER THE PLANS ARE GENERALLY

BASED ON AGE AT RETIREMENT, THE EMPLOYEES ANNUAL EARNINGS INDEXED AT THE

U.S. TREASURY 30-YEAR BOND RATE, AND YEARS OF SERVICE. THE ACTUARIAL COST METHOD

USED IN DETERMINING THE NET PERIODIC PENSION COST IS THE PROJECTED UNIT CREDIT

METHOD.

- 48 -

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS

CONSIST OF HIGHLY LIQUID INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, TIME

DEPOSITS, TREASURY NOTES AND OTHER MONEY MARKET INSTRUMENTS, WHICH GENERALLY

HAVE MATURITIES OF LESS THAN THREE MONTHS. THE COMPANY HAS ADOPTED THE NET

BANK METHOD AS DESCRIBED IN FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB)

INTERPRETATION NO. 39,

OFFSETTING OF AMOUNTS RELATED TO CERTAIN

CONTRACTS

, IN DETERMINING THE CASH ACCRUALS FOR EACH MONTH. THE NET

BANK METHOD NETS THE CURRENT CASH BALANCES BY BANK AND TOTALS ALL NEGATIVE

BALANCES TO DETERMINE THE COMPANYS OVERDRAFT POSITION. THIS ACCRUAL IS

INCLUDED IN ACCOUNTS PAYABLE.

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002, THE

COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 144,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OR DISPOSAL OF

LONG-LIVED ASSETS

. LONG-LIVED ASSETS DEEMED HELD FOR SALE ARE STATED AT THE

LOWER OF COST OR FAIR VALUE. LONG-LIVED ASSETS HELD FOR USE ARE SUBJECT TO AN

IMPAIRMENT ASSESSMENT IF THE CARRYING VALUE IS NO LONGER RECOVERABLE BASED UPON

THE UNDISCOUNTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS OF THE ASSET. THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT IS

THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNT AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE ASSET.

PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY, PLANT AND

EQUIPMENT ARE RECORDED AT COST, INCLUDING APPLICABLE CONSTRUCTION-PERIOD

INTEREST, AND DEPRECIATED PRINCIPALLY OVER THE FOLLOWING ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES.

NEW BUILDINGS AND LAND IMPROVEMENTS, FROM 20 TO 45 YEARS; AND MACHINERY AND

EQUIPMENT, FROM 3 TO 18 YEARS. THE PRINCIPAL METHODS OF DEPRECIATION ARE AS

FOLLOWS: BUILDINGS AND LAND IMPROVEMENTS, 150% DECLINING BALANCE; AND MACHINERY

AND EQUIPMENT, SUM-OF-THE-YEARS DIGITS. THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY EVALUATES

THE APPROPRIATENESS OF REMAINING DEPRECIABLE LIVES ASSIGNED TO LONG-LIVED ASSETS

SUBJECT TO A MANAGEMENT PLAN FOR DISPOSITION.

INVESTMENTS

INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED

AS OTHER ASSETS ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL

POSITION. THE COMPANY CLASSIFIES INVESTMENTS AS EITHER OPERATING OR

NON-OPERATING. OPERATING INVESTMENTS ARE STRATEGIC IN NATURE, WHICH MEANS THEY

ARE INTEGRAL COMPONENTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS. NON-OPERATING

INVESTMENTS ARE THOSE THE COMPANY HOLDS FOR NON-STRATEGIC PURPOSES. EARNINGS

FROM OPERATING INVESTMENTS, INCLUDING THE COMPANYS SHARE OF INCOME OR LOSS

FROM CERTAIN EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, INCOME FROM COST METHOD INVESTMENTS,

IMPAIRMENT CHARGES ON INVESTMENTS, AND ANY GAIN/LOSS ON THE DISPOSITION OF

INVESTMENTS, ARE RECORDED IN INCOME/(LOSS) FROM OPERATING INVESTMENTS,

NET. EARNINGS FROM NON-OPERATING INVESTMENTS ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER

INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS.

CERTAIN INVESTMENTS ARE

ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER SFAS NO. 115,

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT

AND EQUITY SECURITIES

. AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES ARE RECORDED AT THEIR

FAIR VALUES AND UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REPORTED AS PART OF

ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ON THE CONSOLIDATED

STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION. HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES INCLUDE ENHANCED

EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATES AND DEBENTURES FOR WHICH THE COMPANY HAS THE

POSITIVE INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD TO MATURITY. HELD-TO-MATURITY SECURITIES ARE

REPORTED AT AMORTIZED COST. DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CONTINUALLY ASSESSED

FOR IMPAIRMENT. OTHER THAN TEMPORARY LOSSES ON OPERATING INVESTMENTS ARE

RECORDED IN INCOME/(LOSS) FROM OPERATING INVESTMENTS, NET AND OTHER

THAN TEMPORARY LOSSES ON NON-OPERATING INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED IN OTHER

INCOME/(EXPENSE), NET.

GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

AS OF JANUARY 1, 2002, UPON

THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

,

GOODWILL, WHICH NOW INCLUDES ASSEMBLED WORKFORCE, AND INDEFINITE-LIVED

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE NO LONGER AMORTIZED. PRIOR TO THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO.

142, GOODWILL WAS AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER 20 TO 30 YEARS.

ASSEMBLED WORKFORCE WAS AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER 5 TO 15 YEARS.

THE COMPANYS INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSET, A TRADENAME, WAS AMORTIZED

ON A STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER 20 YEARS.

THE COMPANYS

FINITE-LIVED ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD

AND INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING: DEVELOPED TECHNOLOGY, 5 TO 15 YEARS; PRODUCT

KNOW-HOW, 30 YEARS; CUSTOMER BASE, 10 TO 15 YEARS; AND DATA REPOSITORIES, 10 TO

20 YEARS.

- 49 -

DERIVATIVES

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR

DERIVATIVES PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

, AS AMENDED. ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE

RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE REGARDLESS OF

THE PURPOSE OR INTENT FOR HOLDING THEM. CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE EITHER RECOGNIZED PERIODICALLY IN INCOME OR SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY (AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME), DEPENDING ON

THEIR USE AND DESIGNATION.

AIRCRAFT VALUATION

USED AIRCRAFT UNDER TRADE-IN AGREEMENTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

CERTAIN TRADE-IN AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE USED AIRCRAFT FROM CUSTOMERS AT A

SPECIFIC PRICE AT A FUTURE POINT IN TIME WHEN THOSE CUSTOMERS PURCHASE NEW

AIRCRAFT FROM THE COMPANY. IN THE EVENT THE COMPANY ACCEPTS AN AIRCRAFT UNDER A

TRADE-IN AGREEMENT, THE AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY SERVES AS COLLATERAL

TO OFFSET AMOUNTS PAID BY THE COMPANY TO THE CUSTOMER.

OBLIGATIONS RECORDED FROM

TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT AGREEMENTS ARE MEASURED AS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GROSS

AMOUNTS PAYABLE TO CUSTOMERS AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE COLLATERAL. THE

FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL IS DETERMINED USING A PROCESS BASED ON THE NET PRESENT

VALUE OF EXPECTED FUTURE CASH FLOWS FROM THE TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT, ASSUMING THE

MOST LIKELY MARKET PLACEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT. THE FIRST STEP IN THIS PROCESS

USES THE COMPANYS ASSESSMENT OF THE MARKET FOR EACH TRADE-IN AIRCRAFT,

WHICH IN MOST INSTANCES BEGINS YEARS BEFORE THE RETURN OF THE AIRCRAFT. THERE

ARE SEVERAL POSSIBLE MARKETS TO WHICH THE COMPANY CONTINUALLY PURSUES

OPPORTUNITIES TO PLACE USED AIRCRAFT. THESE MARKETS INCLUDE, BUT ARE NOT LIMITED

TO, (1) THE RESALE MARKET, WHICH COULD POTENTIALLY INCLUDE THE COST OF LONG-TERM

STORAGE, (2) THE LEASING MARKET, WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR REFURBISHMENT COSTS TO

MEET THE LEASING CUSTOMERS REQUIREMENTS, OR (3) THE SCRAP MARKET.

COLLATERAL VALUATION VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY DEPENDING ON WHICH MARKET THE COMPANY

DETERMINES IS MOST LIKELY FOR EACH AIRCRAFT. ON A QUARTERLY BASIS, THE COMPANY

UPDATES ITS VALUATION ANALYSIS BASED ON THE ACTUAL ACTIVITIES ASSOCIATED WITH

PLACING EACH AIRCRAFT INTO A MARKET. THIS QUARTERLY COLLATERAL VALUATION PROCESS

YIELDS RESULTS THAT ARE TYPICALLY LOWER THAN RESIDUAL VALUE ESTIMATES BY

INDEPENDENT SOURCES AND TENDS TO MORE ACCURATELY REFLECT RESULTS UPON THE ACTUAL

PLACEMENT OF THE AIRCRAFT.

ASSET VALUATION FOR EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASE, HELD FOR

RE-LEASE AND COLLATERAL ON RECEIVABLES

THE FAIR VALUE OF OWNED ASSETS (EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND ASSETS

HELD FOR RE-LEASE) AND COLLATERAL ON RECEIVABLES IS PERIODICALLY ASSESSED TO

DETERMINE IF THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN THE CARRYING VALUE. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

CARRYING VALUE AND FAIR VALUE ARE CONSIDERED IN DETERMINING THE ALLOWANCE FOR

LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES AND, IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, RECORDED AS IMPAIRMENT FOR

OWNED ASSETS.

THE COMPANY USES THE

AVERAGE PUBLISHED VALUE FROM MULTIPLE SOURCES BASED ON THE TYPE AND AGE OF THE

AIRCRAFT TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF AIRCRAFT. UNDER CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES,

THE COMPANY APPLIES JUDGMENT BASED ON THE ATTRIBUTES OF THE SPECIFIC AIRCRAFT TO

DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, USUALLY WHEN THE FEATURES OR UTILIZATION OF THE AIRCRAFT

VARIES SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE MORE GENERIC AIRCRAFT ATTRIBUTES COVERED BY

OUTSIDE PUBLICATIONS.

IMPAIRMENT REVIEW FOR EQUIPMENT UNDER OPERATING LEASES AND HELD FOR

RE-LEASE

THE COMPANY REVIEWS THESE

ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THAT THE CARRYING

AMOUNT OF THESE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. AN ASSET UNDER OPERATING LEASE OR

HELD FOR RE-LEASE IS CONSIDERED IMPAIRED WHEN THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH

FLOW OVER THE REMAINING USEFUL LIFE IS LESS THAN THE BOOK VALUE. VARIOUS

ASSUMPTIONS ARE USED WHEN DETERMINING THE EXPECTED UNDISCOUNTED CASH FLOW. THESE

ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE LEASE RATES, LEASE TERM(S), PERIODS IN WHICH THE ASSET MAY

BE HELD IN PREPARATION FOR A FOLLOW-ON LEASE, MAINTENANCE COSTS, REMARKETING

COSTS AND THE LIFE OF THE ASSET. THE DETERMINATION OF EXPECTED LEASE RATES IS

GENERALLY BASED ON OUTSIDE PUBLICATIONS. THE COMPANY USES HISTORICAL INFORMATION

AND CURRENT ECONOMIC TRENDS TO DETERMINE THE REMAINING ASSUMPTIONS. WHEN

IMPAIRMENT IS INDICATED FOR AN ASSET, THE AMOUNT OF IMPAIRMENT LOSS IS THE

EXCESS OF CARRYING VALUE OVER FAIR VALUE.

ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON RECEIVABLES

THE ALLOWANCE FOR LOSSES ON

RECEIVABLES (VALUATION ALLOWANCE) IS A VALUATION ACCOUNT USED TO PROVIDE FOR

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF RECEIVABLES ON THE BALANCE SHEET. THE BALANCE IS AN

ACCOUNTING ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE BUT UNCONFIRMED LOSSES IN THE RECEIVABLE

PORTFOLIO. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RELATES TO TWO COMPONENTS OF RECEIVABLES: (A)

SPECIFICALLY IDENTIFIED RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EVALUATED INDIVIDUALLY FOR

IMPAIRMENT, AND (B) POOLS OF RECEIVABLES THAT ARE EVALUATED FOR IMPAIRMENT.

A SPECIFIC RECEIVABLE IS

REVIEWED FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN, BASED ON CURRENT INFORMATION AND EVENTS, IT IS

PROBABLE THAT THE COMPANY WILL BE UNABLE TO COLLECT AMOUNTS DUE ACCORDING TO THE

CONTRACTUAL TERMS OF THE RECEIVABLE AGREEMENT. FACTORS CONSIDERED IN ASSESSING

UNCOLLECTIBILITY INCLUDE A CUSTOMERS EXTENDED DELINQUENCY, REQUESTS FOR

RESTRUCTURING AND FILING FOR BANKRUPTCY. A SPECIFIC IMPAIRMENT ALLOWANCE IS

PROVIDED BASED ON THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE RECEIVABLE

AND THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED COLLATERAL.

- 50 -

THE COMPANY REVIEWS THE

ADEQUACY OF THE GENERAL VALUATION ALLOWANCE ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE REMAINING POOL

OF RECEIVABLES BY ASSESSING BOTH THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE AND THE APPLICABLE

DEFAULT RATE. COLLATERAL EXPOSURE FOR A PARTICULAR RECEIVABLE IS THE EXCESS OF

THE CARRYING VALUE OVER THE APPLICABLE COLLATERAL VALUE OF THE RELATED ASSET. A

RECEIVABLE WITH AN ESTIMATED COLLATERAL VALUE IN EXCESS OF THE CARRYING VALUE IS

CONSIDERED TO HAVE NO COLLATERAL EXPOSURE. THE APPLICABLE DEFAULT RATE IS

DETERMINED USING TWO COMPONENTS: CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS AND WEIGHTED-AVERAGE

REMAINING PORTFOLIO TERM. CREDIT RATINGS ARE IDENTIFIED FOR EACH CUSTOMER IN THE

PORTFOLIO. CUSTOMER CREDIT RATINGS ARE UPDATED BASED ON CURRENT RATING AGENCY

INFORMATION OR THE COMPANYS BEST ESTIMATES.

FOR EACH CREDIT RATING

CATEGORY, THE COLLATERAL EXPOSURE IS MULTIPLIED BY AN APPLICABLE HISTORICAL

DEFAULT RATE, YIELDING A CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL EXPOSURE. HISTORICAL DEFAULT

RATES ARE PUBLISHED BY STANDARD & POORS REFLECTING BOTH THE CUSTOMER

CREDIT RATING AND THE WEIGHTED-AVERAGE REMAINING PORTFOLIO TERM. THE SUM OF THE

CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL EXPOSURES GENERATES AN INITIAL ESTIMATE OF THE

GENERAL VALUATION ALLOWANCE. IN RECOGNITION OF THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ULTIMATE

LOSS EXPERIENCE AND RELATIVELY LONG DURATION OF THE PORTFOLIO, A RANGE OF

REASONABLY POSSIBLE OUTCOMES OF THE PORTFOLIOS CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL

EXPOSURE IS CALCULATED BY VARYING THE APPLICABLE DEFAULT RATE BY APPROXIMATELY

PLUS AND MINUS 15%. THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE RECORDED REPRESENTS THE BEST

ESTIMATE WITHIN THE RESULTING RANGE OF CREDIT-ADJUSTED COLLATERAL EXPOSURE,

FACTORING IN CONSIDERATIONS OF RISK OF INDIVIDUAL CREDITS, CURRENT AND PROJECTED

ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL CONDITIONS, AND PRIOR LOSS EXPERIENCE.

POSTEMPLOYMENT PLANS

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS, SUCH AS SEVERANCE OR JOB TRAINING, UNDER SFAS NO.112,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS.

A LIABILITY FOR

POSTEMPLOYMENT BENEFITS IS RECORDED WHEN PAYMENT IS PROBABLE, THE AMOUNT IS

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE, AND THE OBLIGATION RELATES TO RIGHTS THAT HAVE VESTED OR

ACCUMULATED.

NOTE 2 -

STANDARDS ISSUED AND NOT YET IMPLEMENTED

IN JUNE 2001, THE FASB

ISSUED SFAS NO. 143,

ACCOUNTING FOR ASSET RETIREMENT OBLIGATIONS

, WHICH

IS EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2003. THIS STANDARD ADDRESSES FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND

REPORTING FOR OBLIGATIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RETIREMENT OF TANGIBLE LONG-LIVED

ASSETS AND THE ASSOCIATED RETIREMENT COSTS. THE COMPANY HAS DETERMINED THAT THE

IMPLEMENTATION OF THIS STANDARD WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

IN JULY 2002, THE FASB

ISSUED SFAS NO. 146,

ACCOUNTING FOR COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL

ACTIVITIES

. THIS STANDARD REQUIRES COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH EXIT OR DISPOSAL

ACTIVITIES TO BE RECOGNIZED WHEN THEY ARE INCURRED. THE REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS NO.

146 APPLY PROSPECTIVELY TO ACTIVITIES THAT ARE INITIATED AFTER DECEMBER 31,

2002, AND AS SUCH, THE COMPANY CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING

THESE NEW RULES UNTIL AND UNLESS IT UNDERTAKES RELEVANT ACTIVITIES IN FUTURE

PERIODS.

IN NOVEMBER 2002, THE FASB

ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 45 (FIN 45),

GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING AND

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR GUARANTEES, INCLUDING INDIRECT GUARANTEES OF THE

INDEBTEDNESS OF OTHERS

, WHICH CLARIFIES THE REQUIREMENTS OF SFAS NO. 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES

, RELATING TO A GUARANTORS ACCOUNTING

FOR AND DISCLOSURES OF CERTAIN GUARANTEES ISSUED. FIN 45 REQUIRES ENHANCED

DISCLOSURES FOR CERTAIN GUARANTEES. IT ALSO WILL REQUIRE CERTAIN GUARANTEES THAT

ARE ISSUED OR MODIFIED AFTER DECEMBER 31, 2002, INCLUDING CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY

GUARANTEES, TO BE INITIALLY RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT FAIR VALUE. FOR

GUARANTEES ISSUED ON OR BEFORE DECEMBER 31, 2002, LIABILITIES ARE RECORDED WHEN

AND IF PAYMENTS BECOME PROBABLE AND ESTIMABLE. THE COMPANY EXPECTS FIN 45 TO

HAVE THE GENERAL EFFECT OF DELAYING RECOGNITION FOR A PORTION OF THE

REVENUE FOR PRODUCT SALES THAT ARE ACCOMPANIED BY CERTAIN THIRD-PARTY

GUARANTEES. THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION PROVISIONS ARE EFFECTIVE

PROSPECTIVELY, AND THE COMPANY CANNOT REASONABLY ESTIMATE THE IMPACT OF ADOPTING

FIN 45 UNTIL GUARANTEES ARE ISSUED OR MODIFIED IN FUTURE PERIODS, AT WHICH TIME

THEIR RESULTS WILL BE INITIALLY REPORTED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE NOTE

20.

IN JANUARY 2003, THE FASB

ISSUED INTERPRETATION NO. 46 (FIN 46),

CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST

ENTITIES

, WHICH CLARIFIES THE APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING RESEARCH BULLETIN

NO. 51,

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

, RELATING TO CONSOLIDATION OF

CERTAIN ENTITIES. FIRST, FIN 46 WILL REQUIRE IDENTIFICATION OF THE

COMPANYS PARTICIPATION IN VARIABLE INTERESTS ENTITIES (VIE), WHICH ARE

DEFINED AS ENTITIES WITH A LEVEL OF INVESTED EQUITY THAT IS NOT SUFFICIENT TO

FUND FUTURE ACTIVITIES TO PERMIT THEM TO OPERATE ON A STANDALONE BASIS, OR WHOSE

EQUITY HOLDERS LACK CERTAIN CHARACTERISTICS OF A CONTROLLING FINANCIAL INTEREST.

THEN, FOR ENTITIES IDENTIFIED AS VIE, FIN 46 SETS FORTH A MODEL TO EVALUATE

POTENTIAL CONSOLIDATION BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF WHICH PARTY TO THE VIE, IF

ANY, BEARS A MAJORITY OF THE EXPOSURE TO ITS EXPECTED LOSSES, OR STANDS TO GAIN

FROM A MAJORITY OF ITS EXPECTED RETURNS. FIN 46 ALSO SETS FORTH CERTAIN

DISCLOSURES REGARDING INTERESTS IN VIE THAT ARE DEEMED SIGNIFICANT, EVEN IF

CONSOLIDATION IS NOT REQUIRED. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE

APPLICATION OF FIN 46 AS IT RELATES TO ITS VARIABLE INTERESTS. SEE NOTE 20.

NOTE 3 -

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPACT OF THE SEPTEMBER 11, 2001 TERRORIST ATTACKS

ON SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE

UNITED STATES WAS THE TARGET OF SEVERE TERRORIST ATTACKS THAT INVOLVED THE USE

OF U.S. COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY. THESE ATTACKS RESULTED

IN A SIGNIFICANT LOSS OF LIFE AND PROPERTY AND CAUSED MAJOR DISRUPTIONS IN

BUSINESS ACTIVITIES AND IN THE U.S. ECONOMY OVERALL.

TO ADDRESS THE WIDESPREAD

FINANCIAL IMPACT OF THE ATTACKS, THE EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE (EITF) RELEASED

ISSUE NO. 01-10,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE IMPACT OF TERRORIST ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER

11, 2001

. THIS ISSUE SPECIFICALLY PROHIBITS TREATING COSTS AND LOSSES

RESULTING FROM THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, AS EXTRAORDINARY ITEMS;

HOWEVER, IT OBSERVES THAT ANY PORTION OF THESE COSTS AND LOSSES DEEMED TO BE

UNUSUAL OR INFREQUENTLY OCCURRING SHOULD BE PRESENTED AS A SEPARATE LINE ITEM IN

INCOME FROM CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY REASSESSED THE IMPACT OF THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER

11, 2001, AND RECORDED A NET REDUCTION TO EXPENSE OF $2 IN THE CAPTION

IMPACT OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, CHARGES/(RECOVERIES). THESE

ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT.

FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER

31, 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $935 IN THE CAPTION IMPACT OF

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, CHARGES/(RECOVERIES). OF THIS CHARGE, $908 IS RELATED

TO THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT AND $27 IS RELATED TO THE OTHER SEGMENT.

THE COMPANY INCURRED

EMPLOYMENT REDUCTIONS RESULTING FROM THE DECREASE IN AIRCRAFT DEMAND, WHICH

DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE ATTACKS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. FOR THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY REVISED ITS ESTIMATE RELATED TO ITS EMPLOYEE

SEVERANCE OBLIGATIONS AND RECORDED A REDUCTION TO EXPENSE OF $5. FOR THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $285 RELATED TO THESE

OBLIGATIONS.

- 52 -

717 FORWARD LOSS

AS A RESULT OF THE DECREASE

IN AIRCRAFT DEMAND SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE COMPANY WAS FORCED TO

SHARPLY DECREASE ITS PRODUCTION RATE ON MULTIPLE AIRPLANE PROGRAMS DURING THE

FOURTH QUARTER OF 2001 DUE TO CHANGES IN THE ORDER FORECAST AND CUSTOMER

DELIVERY REQUIREMENTS. ALTHOUGH ALL AIRPLANE PROGRAMS WERE AFFECTED BY THE

EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THROUGH REDUCED MARGINS ON FUTURE DELIVERIES, THE

717 PROGRAM WAS THE ONLY PROGRAM IN A FORWARD LOSS POSITION.

DUE TO A LACK OF FIRM

DEMAND FOR THE 717 AIRCRAFT SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, THE COMPANY

REDUCED THE PROGRAM QUANTITY TO 135 UNITS FROM 200 UNITS AND DECREASED THE 717

PRODUCTION RATE FROM 3.5 PER MONTH TO 1.0 PER MONTH. THIS DECREASE IN THE

PRODUCTION RATE IN CONJUNCTION WITH ITS ORDER QUANTITY REDUCTION SIGNIFICANTLY

IMPACTED THE 717 ANNUAL REVENUE AND COST STRUCTURE. DECREASING THE NUMBER OF

AIRPLANES IN THE PROGRAM QUANTITY ACCELERATES TOOLING AND SPECIAL EQUIPMENT

COSTS OVER A REDUCED NUMBER OF UNITS, THEREBY REDUCING THE GROSS MARGIN OF THE

PROGRAM. AS A FUNCTION OF REDUCING THE NUMBER OF EMPLOYEES AND OTHER PRODUCTION

DISRUPTIONS, COSTS TO BE INCURRED FOR THE PROGRAM INCREASED. ALL OF THESE

FACTORS, WHICH WERE DIRECTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001,

CONTRIBUTED TO THE PROGRAM INCURRING AN ADDITIONAL $250 FORWARD LOSS. THE

ESTIMATES FOR THE REVISED ACCOUNTING QUANTITY ASSUME THAT THE 717 WOULD REMAIN

AN ONGOING PROGRAM.

USED AIRCRAFT VALUATION

THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11,

2001, RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN THE MARKET VALUE OF USED AIRCRAFT

HELD FOR RESALE AS WELL AS ASSET PURCHASE OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO TRADE-IN OF

USED AIRCRAFT. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED A

CHARGE OF $22 RELATED TO A FURTHER DECREASE IN USED AIRPLANE VALUES. FOR THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $185.

INVENTORY VALUATION

SUBSEQUENT TO SEPTEMBER 11,

2001, COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS WORLDWIDE REMOVED A SUBSTANTIAL NUMBER OF

AIRCRAFT FROM SERVICE. THE ULTIMATE REALIZATION OF FUTURE SALES FOR SPECIFIC

SPARE PARTS HELD IN INVENTORY IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE ACTIVE AIRCRAFT FLEET

IN WHICH THAT SPARE PART SUPPORTS. THE REVISED PROJECTIONS FOR FUTURE DEMAND OF

CERTAIN SPARE PARTS INDICATED THAT CURRENT INVENTORY QUANTITIES WERE IN EXCESS

OF TOTAL EXPECTED FUTURE DEMAND. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE

COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $98 RELATING TO EXCESS AND OBSOLETE COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANE SPARES INVENTORY.

VENDOR PENALTIES

THE DECREASE IN PRODUCTION

RATES ON CERTAIN COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE MODELS AND RELATED PRODUCTS TRIGGERED

CONTRACTUAL PENALTY CLAUSES WITH VARIOUS VENDORS AND SUBCONTRACTORS. THE

DECREASE IN PRODUCTION RATES RESULTED DIRECTLY FROM THE CHANGE IN AIRCRAFT

DEMAND AFTER THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2002, THE COMPANY REVISED ITS ESTIMATE RELATED TO ITS OUTSTANDING VENDOR

PENALTIES OBLIGATIONS AND RECORDED A REDUCTION TO EXPENSE OF $12. FOR THE YEAR

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $68 FOR THESE

PENALTIES.

GUARANTEE COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY HAS EXTENDED

CERTAIN GUARANTEES AND COMMITMENTS, SUCH AS ASSET RELATED GUARANTEES, DISCUSSED

IN NOTE 20. THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, ADVERSELY IMPACTED AIRCRAFT MARKET

PRICES AND AIRCRAFT DEMAND OF CUSTOMERS WHO ARE COUNTERPARTIES IN THESE

GUARANTEES. FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED A NET

REDUCTION TO EXPENSE OF $7 AS A RESULT OF FAVORABLE CONTRACT NEGOTIATIONS. FOR

THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CHARGE OF $49 RELATED

TO THE ADVERSE EXPOSURE.

OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

THE COMPANYS OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE EVENTS OF

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001, WERE $146. OF THIS AMOUNT, $53 RELATES TO LIABILITIES TO BE

PRIMARILY SETTLED IN CASH AND THE REMAINING $93 WAS RECORDED AS ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS TO REFLECT THE DECREASE IN THE ANTICIPATED FAIR VALUE OF AIRCRAFT

UNDER PURCHASE COMMITMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE OUTSTANDING LIABILITIES

WERE $542. OF THIS AMOUNT, $402 RELATED TO LIABILITIES TO BE PRIMARILY SETTLED

IN CASH AND $140 RELATED TO USED AIRCRAFT PURCHASE COMMITMENTS.

NOTE 4 -

ACQUISITIONS

ON OCTOBER 6, 2000, THE

COMPANY ACQUIRED THE HUGHES ELECTRONICS CORPORATION (HUGHES) SPACE AND

COMMUNICATIONS AND RELATED BUSINESSES. THE ACQUISITION WAS ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER

THE PURCHASE METHOD, BY WHICH THE PURCHASE PRICE WAS ALLOCATED TO THE NET ASSETS

ACQUIRED BASED ON THEIR FAIR VALUES. THE ORIGINAL PURCHASE PRICE WAS $3,849,

INITIAL GOODWILL WAS VALUED AT $740 AND THE OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS WERE VALUED

AT $631. THE INITIAL RECORDING RELIED ON ASSET AND LIABILITY VALUES REPORTED BY

HUGHES AS OF THE DATE OF THE ACQUISITION WITH ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON PRELIMINARY

VALUATION ASSESSMENTS OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, PURCHASED INTANGIBLES AND

RETIREMENT PLAN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES. DURING THE PERIOD FROM ACQUISITION TO

THE THIRD QUARTER OF 2001, THE COMPANY COMPLETED ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE NET

ASSETS ACQUIRED AND GOODWILL INCREASED TO $2,166. THE INCREASED GOODWILL

REFLECTS FINALIZATION OF FAIR VALUE ASSESSMENTS FOR THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED AND

THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES ON ACQUIRED BALANCES.

CHANGES TO THE FAIR VALUE FOR THE NET ASSETS ACQUIRED PRIMARILY RELATE TO THE

VALUATION OF ACQUIRED LONG-TERM CONTRACTS AND COMPLETION OF THE VALUATION OF

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. THE IMPACT OF THE COMPANYS ACCOUNTING POLICIES ON

ACQUIRED BALANCES RELATE PRIMARILY TO THE APPLICATION OF THE COMPANYS

RECOGNITION OF CONTRACT REVENUE USING PERCENTAGE COMPLETION BASED ON COMPLETED

WORK EFFORT.

NOTE 5 -

GOODWILL AND ACQUIRED INTANGIBLES

EFFECTIVE JANUARY 1, 2002,

THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS NO. 142. THIS STATEMENT CHANGED THE ACCOUNTING FOR

GOODWILL AND INDEFINITE-LIVED INTANGIBLE ASSETS FROM AN AMORTIZATION APPROACH TO

AN IMPAIRMENT-ONLY APPROACH. AS A RESULT OF THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 142, THE

COMPANY RECORDED A TRANSITIONAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE DURING THE FIRST

QUARTER OF 2002 OF $2,410 ($1,827 NET OF TAX), PRESENTED AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT

OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE. THIS CHARGE RELATED TO THE COMPANYS SEGMENTS AS

FOLLOWS: SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS $1,586; COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES $430; AND OTHER

$394. THE OTHER SEGMENT CHARGE RELATED TO CONNEXION BY BOEING

SM

AND

AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT.

THE SFAS NO. 142 GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT MODEL IS A TWO-STEP PROCESS. FIRST, IT REQUIRES A COMPARISON OF THE

BOOK VALUE OF NET ASSETS TO THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RELATED OPERATIONS THAT HAVE

GOODWILL ASSIGNED TO THEM. THE COMPANY ESTIMATES THE FAIR VALUES OF THE RELATED

OPERATIONS USING DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS. THE CASH FLOW FORECASTS ARE ADJUSTED BY

AN APPROPRIATE DISCOUNT RATE DERIVED FROM THE COMPANYS MARKET

CAPITALIZATION PLUS A SUITABLE CONTROL PREMIUM AT THE DATE OF EVALUATION. IF THE

FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE LESS THAN BOOK VALUE, A SECOND STEP IS PERFORMED

TO COMPUTE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. IN THIS PROCESS, A FAIR VALUE FOR

GOODWILL IS ESTIMATED, BASED IN PART ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPERATIONS USED IN

THE FIRST STEP, AND IS COMPARED TO ITS CARRYING VALUE. THE SHORTFALL OF THE FAIR

VALUE BELOW CARRYING VALUE REPRESENTS THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT. SFAS

NO. 142 REQUIRES GOODWILL TO BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY AT THE SAME TIME

EVERY YEAR, AND WHEN AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE SUCH THAT IT IS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT MAY EXIST. THE COMPANY SELECTED APRIL 1

AS ITS ANNUAL TESTING DATE.

- 54 -

AS A RESULT OF THE

COMPANYS ASSESSMENT AS OF APRIL 1, 2002, NO IMPAIRMENT WAS INDICATED AND

NO IMPAIRMENT TRIGGERS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002. EFFECTIVE

JANUARY 1, 2003, THE COMPANY HAS REORGANIZED ITS MILITARY AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE

SYSTEMS AND SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENTS INTO INTEGRATED DEFENSE SYSTEMS.

THIS REORGANIZATION AS WELL AS THE IMPACT OF SEVERAL OTHER VARIABLES, SUCH AS

THE DECLINE IN THE COMPANYS STOCK PRICE, HAS TRIGGERED A GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS AS OF JANUARY 1, 2003. THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY COMPLETING

STEP ONE OF THIS ANALYSIS AND AS OF THE FILING DATE DOES NOT KNOW THE IMPACT, IF

ANY, TO ITS FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

DISAGREES WITH IRS PROPOSED ADJUSTMENTS, AND THE YEARS 1979 THROUGH 1987 ARE IN

LITIGATION. THE IRS EXAMINATION FOR MCDONNELL DOUGLAS CORPORATION FOR THE YEARS

1993 THROUGH 1995 HAS BEEN SETTLED AND THE COMPANY RECEIVED A REFUND OF $102 IN

2002. THE COMPANY BELIEVES ADEQUATE PROVISION FOR ALL OUTSTANDING ISSUES HAS

BEEN MADE FOR ALL OPEN YEARS.

IN DECEMBER 1996, THE

BOEING COMPANY FILED SUIT IN THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF

WASHINGTON FOR THE REFUND OF OVER $400 IN FEDERAL INCOME TAXES AND RELATED

INTEREST. IF THE COMPANY WERE TO PREVAIL, THE REFUND OF THE AMOUNT IN DISPUTE

WOULD INCLUDE INTEREST COMPUTED TO THE PAYMENT DATE. HOWEVER, THE COMPANY CANNOT

PREDICT THE LIKELIHOOD OF A FAVORABLE OUTCOME. THE SUIT CHALLENGED THE IRS

METHOD OF ALLOCATING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS FOR THE PURPOSE OF

DETERMINING TAX INCENTIVE BENEFITS ON EXPORT SALES THROUGH THE COMPANYS

DOMESTIC INTERNATIONAL SALES CORPORATION (DISC) AND ITS FSC FOR THE YEARS 1979

THROUGH 1987. THE COMPANY PREVAILED WITH THE DISTRICT COURT, BUT LOST AN APPEALS

DECISION WITH THE NINTH CIRCUIT COURT OF APPEALS. THE COMPANY APPEALED TO THE

SUPREME COURT AND IS AWAITING THEIR DECISION, WHICH IS EXPECTED IN THE FIRST

HALF OF 2003. THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WILL NOT BE NEGATIVELY

AIRCRAFT FINANCING IS

COLLATERALIZED BY SECURITY IN THE RELATED ASSET, AND THE COMPANY HAS NOT

EXPERIENCED PROBLEMS IN ACCESSING SUCH COLLATERAL. HOWEVER, THE VALUE OF THE

COLLATERAL IS CLOSELY TIED TO COMMERCIAL AIRLINE PERFORMANCE AND MAY BE SUBJECT

TO REDUCED VALUATION WITH MARKET DECLINE. THE OPERATING LEASE AIRCRAFT CATEGORY

PRIMARILY INCLUDES NEW AND USED JET AND COMMUTER AIRCRAFT. AS OF DECEMBER 31,

2002 AND 2001, AIRCRAFT FINANCING OPERATING LEASE EQUIPMENT INCLUDED $786 AND

AIRCRAFT WITH FIRM COMMITMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS EQUIPMENT AVAILABLE FOR

RE-LEASE.

ON MAY 24, 2001, AMERICAN

AIRLINES ISSUED EETCS, AND THE COMPANY THROUGH BCC RECEIVED PROCEEDS

ATTRIBUTABLE TO MONETIZATION OF LEASE RECEIVABLES ASSOCIATED WITH 32 MD-83

AIRCRAFT OWNED BY BCC AND ON LEASE TO AMERICAN AIRLINES. THESE BORROWINGS OF

$566 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, ARE NON-RECOURSE TO THE COMPANY AND ARE

COLLATERALIZED BY THE AIRCRAFT. THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST RATES RANGE FROM 6.82% TO

7.69%. BCC ACCOUNTS FOR THIS TRANSACTION AS A LEVERAGED LEASE, THEREFORE, THIS

DEBT BALANCE IS NETTED AGAINST THE BCC SALES-TYPE/FINANCING LEASE ASSETS.

IN DECEMBER 2002, BCC

COMPLETED AN ASSET SECURITIZATION THAT RAISED $299 OF SECURED DEBT THROUGH THE

USE OF A BANK-SPONSORED COMMERCIAL PAPER CONDUIT (C/P CONDUIT). AS COLLATERAL

FOR THE DEBT, BCC TRANSFERRED $331 OF ASSETS FROM ITS PORTFOLIO TO THE C/P

CONDUIT. THESE PORTFOLIO ASSETS CONSISTED OF THE CASH FLOWS ASSOCIATED WITH

SPECIFIC FINANCING LEASES, NOTES AND OTHER RECEIVABLES AND OPERATING LEASES. BCC

ALSO ASSIGNED TO THE C/P CONDUIT PERFECTED SECURITY INTERESTS IN $278 OF

COLLATERAL UNDERLYING THE TRANSFERRED PORTFOLIO ASSETS. THE COLLATERAL PLEDGED

INDIRECTLY PROVIDES THE C/P CONDUIT WITH ADDITIONAL PROTECTION IN THE EVENT THAT

THE CASH FLOWS FROM THE LEASES AND NOTES ARE INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE TOTAL

DEBT OUTSTANDING UNDER THE TRANSACTION. THE SECURED DEBT AND SECURITIZED ASSETS

REMAIN ON BCCS BALANCE SHEET.

NOTE 16 -

CERTAIN OF THE PENSION

PLANS PROVIDE THAT, IN THE EVENT THERE IS A CHANGE IN CONTROL OF THE COMPANY

WHICH IS NOT APPROVED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND THE PLANS ARE TERMINATED

WITHIN FIVE YEARS THEREAFTER, THE ASSETS IN THE PLAN FIRST WILL BE USED TO

PROVIDE THE LEVEL OF RETIREMENT BENEFITS REQUIRED BY THE EMPLOYEE RETIREMENT

INCOME SECURITY ACT, AND THEN ANY SURPLUS WILL BE USED TO FUND A TRUST TO

CONTINUE PRESENT AND FUTURE PAYMENTS UNDER THE POSTRETIREMENT MEDICAL AND LIFE

INSURANCE BENEFITS IN THE COMPANYS GROUP INSURANCE BENEFIT PROGRAMS.

THE COMPANY HAS AN

AGREEMENT WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WITH RESPECT TO CERTAIN OF THE COMPANY

PENSION PLANS. UNDER THE AGREEMENT, SHOULD THE COMPANY TERMINATE ANY OF THE

PLANS UNDER CONDITIONS IN WHICH THE PLANS ASSETS EXCEED THAT PLANS

OBLIGATIONS, THE U.S. GOVERNMENT WILL BE ENTITLED TO A FAIR ALLOCATION OF ANY OF

THE PLANS ASSETS BASED ON PLAN CONTRIBUTIONS THAT WERE REIMBURSED UNDER

U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. ALSO, THE REVENUE RECONCILIATION ACT OF 1990 IMPOSES

A 20% NON-DEDUCTIBLE EXCISE TAX ON THE GROSS ASSETS REVERTED IF THE COMPANY

ESTABLISHES A QUALIFIED REPLACEMENT PLAN OR AMENDS THE TERMINATING PLAN TO

PROVIDE FOR BENEFIT INCREASES; OTHERWISE, A 50% TAX IS APPLIED. ANY NET AMOUNT

RETAINED BY THE COMPANY IS TREATED AS TAXABLE INCOME.

THE COMPANY PROVIDES

CERTAIN DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS TO ALL ELIGIBLE EMPLOYEES. THE PRINCIPAL

PLANS ARE THE COMPANY-SPONSORED 401(K) PLANS AND A FUNDED PLAN FOR UNUSED SICK

LEAVE. THE PROVISION FOR THESE DEFINED CONTRIBUTION PLANS WAS $448, $452 AND

$406 IN 2002, 2001, AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 17 -

SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION

THE SHARE-BASED PLANS

EXPENSE CAPTION ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS REPRESENTS

THE TOTAL EXPENSE RECOGNIZED FOR ALL COMPANY PLANS THAT ARE PAYABLE ONLY IN

STOCK. THESE PLANS ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

CERTAIN DEFERRED STOCK

COMPENSATION PLANS ARE REFLECTED IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSE. THE

COMPANY HAS ISSUED 7,244,094 STOCK UNITS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THAT ARE

CONVERTIBLE TO EITHER STOCK OR A CASH EQUIVALENT, OF WHICH 6,639,457 ARE VESTED,

AND THE REMAINDER VEST WITH EMPLOYEE SERVICE. THESE STOCK UNITS PRINCIPALLY

REPRESENT A METHOD OF DEFERRING EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION BY WHICH A LIABILITY IS

ESTABLISHED BASED UPON THE CURRENT STOCK PRICE. AN EXPENSE OR REDUCTION IN

EXPENSE IS RECOGNIZED ASSOCIATED WITH THE CHANGE IN THAT LIABILITY BALANCE. THE

REDUCTION IN EXPENSE (EXPENSE) RELATED TO DEFERRED STOCK COMPENSATION WAS $42,

$163 AND $(75) IN 2002, 2001 AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

STOCK UNITS THAT ARE CONVERTIBLE TO COMMON STOCK CONTINGENT UPON STOCK PRICE

PERFORMANCE. IF, AT ANY TIME UP TO FIVE YEARS AFTER AWARD, THE STOCK PRICE

REACHES AND MAINTAINS A PRICE EQUAL TO 161.0% OF THE STOCK ISSUE PRICE AT THE

DATE OF THE AWARD (REPRESENTING A GROWTH RATE OF 10% COMPOUNDED ANNUALLY FOR

FIVE YEARS), 25% OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDED ARE CONVERTIBLE TO COMMON

STOCK. LIKEWISE, AT STOCK PRICES EQUAL TO 168.5%, 176.2%, 184.2%, 192.5% AND

201.1% OF THE STOCK PRICE AT THE DATE OF AWARD, THE CUMULATIVE PORTION OF

AWARDED PERFORMANCE SHARES CONVERTIBLE TO COMMON STOCK ARE 40%, 55%, 75%, 100%

AND 125%, RESPECTIVELY. PERFORMANCE SHARES AWARDS NOT CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK

EXPIRE FIVE YEARS AFTER THE DATE OF THE AWARD; HOWEVER, THE COMPENSATION

COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS MAY, AT ITS DISCRETION, ALLOW VESTING OF UP

TO 100% OF THE TARGET PERFORMANCE SHARES IF THE COMPANYS TOTAL SHAREHOLDER

RETURN (STOCK PRICE APPRECIATION PLUS DIVIDENDS) DURING THE FIVE-YEAR

PERFORMANCE PERIOD EXCEEDS THE AVERAGE TOTAL SHAREHOLDER RETURN OF THE S&P

500 OVER THE SAME PERIOD.

NO PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS

WERE CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK OR DEFERRED STOCK UNITS IN 2002 OR 2001. DURING

2000, 75% OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS EXPIRING FEBRUARY 22, 2004, WERE

CONVERTED TO COMMON STOCK OR DEFERRED STOCK UNITS (CUMULATIVE 3,402,874

PERFORMANCE SHARES), AND 55% OF THE PERFORMANCE SHARE AWARDS EXPIRING FEBRUARY

SHAREVALUE TRUST

THE SHAREVALUE TRUST,

ESTABLISHED EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 1996, IS A 14-YEAR IRREVOCABLE TRUST THAT HOLDS

BOEING COMMON STOCK, RECEIVES DIVIDENDS, AND DISTRIBUTES TO EMPLOYEES

APPRECIATION IN VALUE ABOVE A 3% PER ANNUM THRESHOLD RATE OF RETURN. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE TRUST HELD 40,373,809 SHARES OF THE COMPANYS COMMON

STOCK, SPLIT EQUALLY BETWEEN TWO FUNDS, FUND 1 AND FUND

2. IF ON JUNE 30, 2004, THE MARKET VALUE OF FUND 2 EXCEEDS $913 (THE

THRESHOLD REPRESENTING A 3% PER ANNUM RATE OF RETURN), THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF

THE THRESHOLD WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO EMPLOYEES. THE JUNE 30, 2004, MARKET VALUE

OF FUND 2 AFTER DISTRIBUTION (IF ANY) WILL BE THE BASIS FOR DETERMINING ANY

POTENTIAL DISTRIBUTION ON JUNE 30, 2008. SIMILARLY, IF ON JUNE 30, 2006, THE

MARKET VALUE OF FUND 1 EXCEEDS $1,004, THE AMOUNT IN EXCESS OF THE THRESHOLD

WILL BE DISTRIBUTED TO EMPLOYEES. SHARES HELD BY THE TRUST ON JUNE 30, 2010,

AFTER FINAL DISTRIBUTION WILL REVERT BACK TO THE COMPANY.

THE SHAREVALUE TRUST IS

ACCOUNTED FOR AS A CONTRA-EQUITY ACCOUNT AND STATED AT MARKET VALUE. MARKET

VALUE ADJUSTMENTS ARE OFFSET TO ADDITIONAL PAID-IN CAPITAL.

- 73 -

STOCK OPTIONS

THE COMPANYS 1997

INCENTIVE STOCK PLAN (1997 PLAN) PERMITS THE GRANT OF STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK

SHAREHOLDERS' EQUITY

IN AUGUST 1998, THE BOARD

OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A RESOLUTION AUTHORIZING MANAGEMENT TO REPURCHASE UP TO

15% OF THE COMPANYS ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING STOCK AS OF JUNE 30, 1998

(EXCLUDING SHARES HELD BY THE SHAREVALUE TRUST), WHICH AMOUNTED TO 145,899,000

SHARES. THIS REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS COMPLETED IN 2000. IN DECEMBER 2000 AN

ADDITIONAL REPURCHASE PROGRAM WAS AUTHORIZED BY THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS. UNDER

THIS RESOLUTION, MANAGEMENT IS AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE UP TO 85,000,000 SHARES.

THE COMPANY DID NOT REPURCHASE ANY SHARES DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2002. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE COMPANY HAD REPURCHASED 40,734,500 SHARES.

TWENTY MILLION SHARES OF

AUTHORIZED PREFERRED STOCK REMAIN UNISSUED.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

DERIVATIVE AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

AS ADOPTED JANUARY 1, 2001,

THE COMPANY ACCOUNTS FOR DERIVATIVES PURSUANT TO SFAS NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

, AS AMENDED. THIS STANDARD

REQUIRES THAT ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS BE RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE REGARDLESS OF THE PURPOSE OR INTENT FOR

HOLDING THEM. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 133 IN 2001 RESULTED IN A TRANSITION GAIN

OF $1 ON THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF OPERATIONS SHOWN UNDER THE CAPTION

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF ACCOUNTING CHANGE, NET OF TAX, AND A NET LOSS

OF $18 ($11 NET OF TAX) RECORDED TO ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO A

VARIETY OF MARKET RISKS, INCLUDING THE EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES,

FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, AND COMMODITY PRICES. THESE EXPOSURES ARE

MANAGED, IN PART, WITH THE USE OF DERIVATIVES. INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS

UNDER WHICH THE COMPANY AGREES TO PAY FIXED RATES OF INTEREST ARE GENERALLY

DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES OF VARIABLE-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY

USES INTEREST RATE SWAPS TO ADJUST THE AMOUNT OF TOTAL DEBT THAT IS SUBJECT TO

VARIABLE AND FIXED INTEREST RATES. THE FOLLOWING IS A SUMMARY OF THE

COMPANYS RISK MANAGEMENT STRATEGIES AND THE EFFECT OF THESE STRATEGIES ON

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FAIR VALUE HEDGES

FOR DERIVATIVES DESIGNATED

AS HEDGES OF THE EXPOSURE TO CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A RECOGNIZED ASSET OR

LIABILITY OR A FIRM COMMITMENT (REFERRED TO AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES), THE GAIN OR

LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE

OFFSETTING LOSS OR GAIN ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE RISK BEING

HEDGED. THE EFFECT OF THAT ACCOUNTING IS TO REFLECT IN EARNINGS THE EXTENT TO

WHICH THE HEDGE IS NOT EFFECTIVE IN ACHIEVING OFFSETTING CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE.

INTEREST RATE SWAPS UNDER

WHICH THE COMPANY AGREES TO PAY VARIABLE RATES OF INTEREST ARE DESIGNATED AS

FAIR VALUE HEDGES OF FIXED-RATE DEBT. THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS FORWARD-STARTING

INTEREST RATE SWAP AGREEMENTS TO FIX THE COST OF FUNDING A FIRMLY COMMITTED

LEASE FOR WHICH PAYMENT TERMS ARE DETERMINED IN ADVANCE OF FUNDING. THIS HEDGE

RELATIONSHIP MITIGATES THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THE HEDGED PORTION OF THE

FIRM COMMITMENT CAUSED BY CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. THE NET CHANGE IN FAIR

VALUE OF THE DERIVATIVES AND THE HEDGED ITEMS IS REPORTED IN EARNINGS. FOR THE

YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, INEFFECTIVENESS LOSSES OF $8 WERE RECORDED IN

INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO THE FORWARD-STARTING INTEREST RATE SWAPS.

INEFFECTIVENESS WAS INSIGNIFICANT FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001.

- 75 -

FOR THE YEARS ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, $5 AND $1 OF GAINS RELATED TO THE BASIS ADJUSTMENT

OF CERTAIN TERMINATED INTEREST RATE SWAPS WERE AMORTIZED TO EARNINGS. DURING

2003, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO AMORTIZE $8 OF GAINS FROM THE AMOUNT RECORDED IN

THE BASIS ADJUSTMENT OF CERTAIN TERMINATED FAIR VALUE HEDGE RELATIONSHIPS TO

EARNINGS.

AS HEDGES OF THE EXPOSURE TO VARIABLE CASH FLOWS OF A FORECASTED TRANSACTION

(REFERRED TO AS CASH FLOW HEDGES), THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE

DERIVATIVES GAIN OR LOSS IS INITIALLY REPORTED IN SHAREHOLDERS

EQUITY (AS A COMPONENT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME) AND

SUBSEQUENTLY RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR

LOSS IS REPORTED IN EARNINGS IMMEDIATELY.

CASH FLOW HEDGES USED BY

THE COMPANY INCLUDE CERTAIN INTEREST RATE SWAPS, FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD

CONTRACTS, AND COMMODITY PURCHASE CONTRACTS. INTEREST RATE SWAP CONTRACTS UNDER

WHICH THE COMPANY AGREES TO PAY FIXED RATES OF INTEREST ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH

FLOW HEDGES OF VARIABLE-RATE DEBT OBLIGATIONS. THE COMPANY USES FOREIGN CURRENCY

FORWARD CONTRACTS TO MANAGE CURRENCY RISK ASSOCIATED WITH CERTAIN FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS, SPECIFICALLY SALES AND PURCHASE COMMITMENTS MADE IN FOREIGN

CURRENCIES. THE COMPANYS FOREIGN CURRENCY FORWARD CONTRACTS HEDGE

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS PRINCIPALLY OCCURRING UP TO FIVE YEARS IN THE FUTURE.

COMMODITY DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS FIXED-PRICE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS, ARE USED BY THE

COMPANY TO HEDGE AGAINST POTENTIALLY UNFAVORABLE PRICE CHANGES FOR ITEMS USED IN

PRODUCTION.

THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO

CERTAIN COMMITMENTS TO PURCHASE ELECTRICITY AT FIXED PRICES OVER THE NEXT TWO

YEARS, A PERCENTAGE OF WHICH ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGES. THE CHANGES IN

FAIR VALUE OF THE PERCENTAGE OF THE COMMODITY DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT

DESIGNATED IN A HEDGING RELATIONSHIP ARE RECORDED IN EARNINGS IMMEDIATELY. THERE

WERE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE REPORTED IN EARNINGS FOR THE YEARS

ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001.

AT DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND

2001, NET LOSSES OF $74 ($47 NET OF TAX) AND $172 ($108 NET OF TAX) WERE

RECORDED IN ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME ASSOCIATED WITH THE

COMPANYS CASH FLOW HEDGING TRANSACTIONS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31,

2002 AND 2001, LOSSES OF $46 AND $14 (NET OF TAX) WERE RECLASSIFIED TO COST OF

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. DURING THE NEXT YEAR, THE COMPANY EXPECTS TO RECLASSIFY

TO COST OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES A LOSS OF $22 (NET OF TAX).

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS NOT RECEIVING HEDGE TREATMENT

THE COMPANY ALSO HOLDS CERTAIN

NON-HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, SUCH AS INTEREST EXCHANGE AGREEMENTS, INTEREST RATE

SWAPS, WARRANTS, CONVERSION FEATURE OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY

FORWARD CONTRACTS. THE CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE OF THESE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED

IN EARNINGS. FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001, THESE NON-HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS RESULTED IN GAINS OF $25 AND $15.

THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED

VARIOUS ASSET-RELATED GUARANTEES, PRINCIPALLY TO FACILITATE THE SALE OF CERTAIN

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO MAKE

PAYMENTS TO A GUARANTEED PARTY IN THE EVENT THE RELATED AIRCRAFT FAIR VALUES

FALL BELOW A SPECIFIED AMOUNT AT A FUTURE POINT IN TIME. THESE OBLIGATIONS ARE

COLLATERALIZED PRINCIPALLY BY COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT, AND EXPIRE WITHIN THE NEXT 16

YEARS. NO AIRCRAFT HAVE BEEN DELIVERED WITH THESE TYPES OF GUARANTEES IN SEVERAL

YEARS.

THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED

CREDIT GUARANTEES TO CREDITORS OF THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE, OF WHICH THE COMPANY

IS A 40% OWNER, TO ASSIST THE VENTURE IN OBTAINING FINANCING. IN THE EVENT THE

COMPANY IS REQUIRED TO PERFORM ON THESE GUARANTEES, IT HAS THE RIGHT TO RECOVER

A PORTION OF THE LOSS FROM ANOTHER VENTURE PARTNER, AND HAS COLLATERAL RIGHTS TO

CERTAIN ASSETS OF THE VENTURE. IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY HAS ISSUED CREDIT

GUARANTEES, PRINCIPALLY TO FACILITATE THE SALE OF CERTAIN COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.

UNDER THESE ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS OBLIGATED TO MAKE PAYMENTS TO A

GUARANTEED PARTY IN THE EVENT THAT LEASE OR LOAN PAYMENTS ARE NOT MADE BY THE

ORIGINAL DEBTOR OR LESSEE. THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CREDIT-RELATED

GUARANTEES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY THE UNDERLYING COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT. A

SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF THESE GUARANTEES HAVE BEEN EXTENDED ON BEHALF OF ORIGINAL

DEBTORS OR LESSEES WITH LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. CURRENT OUTSTANDING

CREDIT GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHIN THE NEXT 13 YEARS.

AS A LIQUIDITY PROVIDER FOR

ETC PASS-THROUGH ARRANGEMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS CERTAIN OBLIGATIONS TO INVESTORS

IN THE TRUSTS, WHICH REQUIRES FUNDING TO THE TRUST TO COVER INTEREST DUE TO SUCH

INVESTORS RESULTING FROM AN EVENT OF DEFAULT BY UNITED AIRLINES. IN THE EVENT OF

FUNDING, THE COMPANY RECEIVES A FIRST PRIORITY POSITION IN THE ETC COLLATERAL IN

THE AMOUNT OF THE FUNDING. ON FEBRUARY 7, 2003, THE COMPANY ADVANCED $101 TO THE

TRUST PERFECTING ITS COLLATERAL POSITION AND TERMINATING ITS LIQUIDITY

OBLIGATION. THE TRUST CURRENTLY HAS COLLATERAL VALUE THAT SIGNIFICANTLY EXCEEDS

THE AMOUNT DUE TO THE COMPANY.

ALSO RELATING TO ITS ETC

INVESTMENTS, THE COMPANY HAS POTENTIAL OBLIGATIONS RELATING TO SHORTFALL

INTEREST PAYMENTS IN THE EVENT THAT THE INTEREST RATES IN THE UNDERLYING

AGREEMENTS ARE RESET BELOW A CERTAIN LEVEL ACCORDING TO THE TERMS OF THESE

AGREEMENTS. THESE OBLIGATIONS WOULD CEASE IF UNITED AIRLINES WERE TO DEFAULT ON

ITS INTEREST PAYMENTS TO THE TRUST. THESE GUARANTEES WILL EXPIRE WITHIN THE NEXT

12 YEARS.

THE COMPANY HAS OUTSTANDING

PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES ISSUED IN CONJUNCTION WITH JOINT VENTURE INVESTMENTS.

PURSUANT TO THESE GUARANTEES, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO MAKE PAYMENTS IN

THE EVENT A THIRD-PARTY FAILS TO PERFORM SPECIFIED SERVICES. CURRENT PERFORMANCE

GUARANTEES EXPIRE WITHIN THE NEXT 15 YEARS.

PRODUCT WARRANTIES

THE COMPANY PROVIDES

PRODUCT WARRANTIES IN CONJUNCTION WITH CERTAIN PRODUCT SALES.

THE MAJORITY OF THE

COMPANYS WARRANTIES ARE ISSUED BY THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT.

GENERALLY, AIRCRAFT SALES ARE ACCOMPANIED BY A 3 TO 4 YEAR STANDARD WARRANTY FOR

SYSTEMS, ACCESSORIES, EQUIPMENT, PARTS, AND SOFTWARE MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY

OR MANUFACTURED TO CERTAIN STANDARDS UNDER ITS AUTHORIZATION. THESE WARRANTIES

COVER FACTORS SUCH AS NON-CONFORMANCE TO SPECIFICATIONS AND DEFECTS IN MATERIAL

AND DESIGN. WARRANTIES ISSUED BY THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS AND MILITARY

AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENTS PRINCIPALLY RELATE TO SALES OF MILITARY

AIRCRAFT AND WEAPONS HARDWARE. THESE SALES ARE GENERALLY ACCOMPANIED BY A SIX TO

TWELVE-MONTH WARRANTY PERIOD AND COVER SYSTEMS, ACCESSORIES, EQUIPMENT, PARTS,

AND SOFTWARE MANUFACTURED BY THE COMPANY TO CERTAIN CONTRACTUAL SPECIFICATIONS.

THESE WARRANTIES COVER FACTORS SUCH AS NON-CONFORMANCE TO SPECIFICATIONS AND

DEFECTS IN MATERIAL AND WORKMANSHIP.

MATERIAL VARIABLE INTERESTS IN UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY

ASSESSING THE APPLICATION OF FIN 46 AS IT RELATES TO ITS VARIABLE INTERESTS.

WHILE THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY NOT REQUIRED TO CONSOLIDATE THE FULL AMOUNT OF

THE ETCS, EETCS OR THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE IN WHICH IT HAS INVESTED, IT IS UNABLE

TO DEFINITIVELY CONCLUDE AT THIS TIME WHETHER CONSOLIDATION OR DISCLOSURE WILL

BE REQUIRED FOR THESE INVESTMENTS UPON FULL ADOPTION OF FIN 46. THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN ETCS AND EETCS AGGREGATED $455 AT DECEMBER 31,

2002. THE COMPANYS TOTAL MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS FROM ETCS AND EETCS IS

$637, COMPRISED OF THE $455 INVESTMENT BALANCE, RIGHTS TO COLLATERAL ESTIMATED

AT $101 RELATED TO LIQUIDITY OBLIGATIONS SATISFIED IN FEBRUARY 2003, AND A

MAXIMUM POTENTIAL EXPOSURE OF $81 RELATING TO POTENTIAL SHORTFALL INTEREST

PAYMENTS. DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED REVENUES

OF $25, CASH INFLOWS OF $41, AND IMPAIRMENT EXPENSE OF $79 RELATING TO THESE

INVESTMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE VIE (ETCS AND EETCS) IN WHICH THE

COMPANY HAS INVESTED HAVE TOTAL ASSETS OF APPROXIMATELY $4,200 AND TOTAL DEBT

(WHICH IS NON-RECOURSE TO THE COMPANY) OF APPROXIMATELY $3,700. RELATED TO THE

SEA LAUNCH VENTURE, THE COMPANYS TOTAL MAXIMUM EXPOSURE TO LOSS IS $621

ASSUMING NO ESTIMATED PROCEEDS FROM COLLATERAL OR RECOURSE FROM OTHER VENTURE

PARTNERS, COMPRISED OF $335 OF EXPOSURE RELATED TO GUARANTEES TO CERTAIN SEA

LAUNCH CREDITORS ($535 NET OF $200 IN ESTABLISHED RESERVES), $33 OF EXPOSURE

RELATED TO PERFORMANCE GUARANTEES PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY TO A SEA LAUNCH

CUSTOMER AND $253 OF FINANCIAL EXPOSURE RELATED TO ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE/INVENTORY

REFLECTED IN THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL

LIABILITIES OF THE SEA LAUNCH VENTURE EACH REPRESENT LESS THAN 4% OF THE

COMPANYS CONSOLIDATED TOTAL ASSETS AND TOTAL LIABILITIES AS OF DECEMBER

31, 2002. THE COMPANY MADE NO ADDITIONAL CAPITAL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SEA LAUNCH

VENTURE DURING THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002.

OTHER COMMITMENTS

THE COMPANY ENTERS INTO

CERTAIN TRADE-IN AGREEMENTS TO PURCHASE USED AIRCRAFT FROM CUSTOMERS AT A

SPECIFIC PRICE AT A FUTURE POINT IN TIME WHEN THOSE CUSTOMERS PURCHASE NEW

AIRCRAFT FROM THE COMPANY. IN THE EVENT THE COMPANY ACCEPTS AN AIRCRAFT UNDER A

TRADE-IN AGREEMENT, THE AIRCRAFT PURCHASED BY THE COMPANY SERVES AS COLLATERAL

TO OFFSET AMOUNTS PAID BY THE COMPANY TO THE CUSTOMER. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002

AND 2001, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDED $156 AND $189 RELATED

TO TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS, OF WHICH $93 AND $140 WAS RELATED TO THE EVENTS OF

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001. THE TOTAL CONTRACTUAL TRADE-IN VALUE OF ALL AIRCRAFT THAT

CUSTOMERS HAD THE RIGHT TO SELL TO THE COMPANY WAS $1,993 AND $3,262 AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001. THE COMPANY ESTIMATED THE FAIR VALUE OF THOSE

AIRCRAFT WAS $1,837 AND $3,073 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001. THERE IS A HIGH

DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY INHERENT IN THE ASSESSMENT OF THE LIKELIHOOD OF TRADE-IN

COMMITMENTS. UPDATES ON THE LIKELIHOOD THAT TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS WILL BE

EXERCISED USING BOTH QUANTITATIVE INFORMATION FROM VALUATION SOURCES AND

QUALITATIVE INFORMATION FROM OTHER SOURCES ARE CONTINUALLY ASSESSED. THE COMPANY

CONTINUES TO MONITOR ALL TRADE-IN COMMITMENTS FOR ADVERSE DEVELOPMENTS.

IRREVOCABLE FINANCING

COMMITMENTS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER, INCLUDING OPTIONS, SCHEDULED FOR

DELIVERY THROUGH 2007 TOTALED $3,223 AND $7,508 AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND

2001. THE COMPANY ANTICIPATES THAT NOT ALL OF THESE COMMITMENTS WILL BE UTILIZED

AND THAT IT WILL BE ABLE TO ARRANGE FOR THIRD-PARTY INVESTORS TO ASSUME A

PORTION OF THE REMAINING COMMITMENTS, IF NECESSARY. THE COMPANY HAS OTHER

ADDITIONAL COMMITMENTS TO ARRANGE FOR EQUIPMENT FINANCING TOTALING $106 AND $344

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND 2001.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND

2001, FUTURE LEASE COMMITMENTS ON AIRCRAFT NOT RECORDED ON THE CONDENSED

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION TOTALED $246 AND $323. THESE LEASE

COMMITMENTS EXTEND THROUGH 2015, AND THE COMPANYS INTENT IS TO RECOVER

THESE LEASE COMMITMENTS THROUGH SUBLEASE ARRANGEMENTS. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002

AND 2001, ACCOUNTS PAYABLE AND OTHER LIABILITIES INCLUDED $130 ($2 RELATED TO

THE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11, 2001) AND $116 ($1 RELATED TO THE EVENTS OF

SEPTEMBER 11, 2001) ATTRIBUTABLE TO ADVERSE COMMITMENTS UNDER THESE LEASE

ARRANGEMENTS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

THE COMPANY HAD EXTENDED A $69 CREDIT LINE AGREEMENT TO ONE OF ITS JOINT VENTURE

PARTNERS. TO DATE, $33 HAD BEEN DRAWN ON THIS AGREEMENT, WHICH WAS RECORDED AS

AN ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT IN THE JOINT VENTURE.

NOTE 21 -

SIGNIFICANT GROUP CONCENTRATIONS OF RISK

CREDIT RISK

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS INVOLVING

POTENTIAL CREDIT RISK ARE PREDOMINANTLY WITH COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS AND

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. OF THE $17,218 IN ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND CUSTOMER

FINANCING INCLUDED IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF FINANCIAL POSITION, $8,837

RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS ($315 OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND $8,522

OF CUSTOMER FINANCING) AND $2,860 RELATED TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. OF THE $8,522

OF AIRCRAFT CUSTOMER FINANCING, $7,606 RELATED TO CUSTOMERS THE COMPANY BELIEVES

HAVE LESS THAN INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT. AMR CORPORATION, AIRTRAN AIRWAYS AND UAL

CORPORATION WERE ASSOCIATED WITH 11%, 12% AND 14% OF ALL FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

RELATED TO CUSTOMER FINANCING. FINANCING FOR AIRCRAFT IS COLLATERALIZED BY

SECURITY IN THE RELATED ASSET, AND HISTORICALLY THE COMPANY HAS NOT EXPERIENCED

A PROBLEM IN ACCESSING SUCH COLLATERAL.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 20 PREDOMINANTLY

RELATED TO COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT CUSTOMERS. SIMILARLY, OF THE $3,223 OF

IRREVOCABLE FINANCING COMMITMENTS RELATED TO AIRCRAFT ON ORDER INCLUDING

OPTIONS, $3,128 RELATED TO CUSTOMERS THE COMPANY BELIEVES HAVE LESS THAN

INVESTMENT-GRADE CREDIT.

OTHER RISK

THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES

SEGMENT IS SUBJECT TO BOTH OPERATIONAL AND EXTERNAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT RISKS.

OPERATIONAL RISKS THAT CAN DISRUPT THE COMPANYS ABILITY TO MAKE TIMELY

DELIVERY OF ITS COMMERCIAL JET AIRCRAFT AND MEET ITS CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS

INCLUDE EXECUTION OF INTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS, PRODUCT PERFORMANCE RISKS

ASSOCIATED WITH REGULATORY CERTIFICATIONS OF THE COMPANYS COMMERCIAL

AIRCRAFT BY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, OTHER REGULATORY

UNCERTAINTIES, COLLECTIVE BARGAINING LABOR DISPUTES, PERFORMANCE ISSUES WITH KEY

SUPPLIERS AND SUBCONTRACTORS AND THE COST AND AVAILABILITY OF ENERGY RESOURCES,

SUCH AS ELECTRICAL POWER. AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS, PARTICULARLY NEW AIRCRAFT MODELS

SUCH AS THE 717 PROGRAM, FACE THE ADDITIONAL RISK OF PRICING PRESSURES AND COST

MANAGEMENT ISSUES INHERENT IN THE DESIGN AND PRODUCTION OF COMPLEX PRODUCTS.

FINANCING SUPPORT MAY BE PROVIDED BY THE COMPANY TO AIRLINES, SOME OF WHICH ARE

UNABLE TO OBTAIN OTHER FINANCING. EXTERNAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT RISKS INCLUDE

ADVERSE GOVERNMENTAL EXPORT AND IMPORT POLICIES, FACTORS THAT RESULT IN

SIGNIFICANT AND PROLONGED DISRUPTION TO AIR TRAVEL WORLDWIDE, AND OTHER FACTORS

THAT AFFECT THE ECONOMIC VIABILITY OF THE COMMERCIAL AIRLINE INDUSTRY. EXAMPLES

OF FACTORS RELATING TO EXTERNAL BUSINESS ENVIRONMENT RISKS INCLUDE THE

VOLATILITY OF AIRCRAFT FUEL PRICES, GLOBAL TRADE POLICIES, WORLDWIDE POLITICAL

STABILITY AND ECONOMIC GROWTH, ACTS OF AGGRESSION THAT IMPACT THE PERCEIVED

SAFETY OF COMMERCIAL FLIGHT, ESCALATION TRENDS INHERENT IN PRICING THE

COMPANYS AIRCRAFT, AND A COMPETITIVE INDUSTRY STRUCTURE WHICH RESULTS IN

MARKET PRESSURE TO REDUCE PRODUCT PRICES.

IN ADDITION TO THE

FOREGOING RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT, THE MILITARY

AIRCRAFT AND MISSILE SYSTEMS SEGMENT AND THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT

ARE SUBJECT TO CHANGING PRIORITIES OR REDUCTIONS IN THE U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE

AND SPACE BUDGET, AND TERMINATION OF GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS DUE TO UNILATERAL

GOVERNMENT ACTION (TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE) OR FAILURE TO PERFORM

(TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT). CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE PROCEEDINGS

INVOLVING FINES, COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION, FORFEITURE AND

SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT FROM GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS MAY RESULT FROM VIOLATIONS OF

BUSINESS AND COST CLASSIFICATION REGULATIONS ON U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

THE COMMERCIAL LAUNCH AND

SATELLITE SERVICE MARKETS HAVE SOME DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY SINCE GLOBAL DEMAND IS

DRIVEN IN PART BY THE LAUNCH CUSTOMERS ACCESS TO CAPITAL MARKETS.

ADDITIONALLY, SOME OF THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS FOR LAUNCH SERVICES RECEIVE

DIRECT OR INDIRECT GOVERNMENT FUNDING. THE SATELLITE MARKET INCLUDES SOME DEGREE

OF RISK AND UNCERTAINTY RELATING TO THE ATTAINMENT OF TECHNOLOGICAL

SPECIFICATIONS AND PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS.

RISK ASSOCIATED WITH THE

BOEING CAPITAL CORPORATION SEGMENT INCLUDES INTEREST RATE RISKS, ASSET VALUATION

RISKS, SPECIFICALLY, AIRCRAFT VALUATION RISKS, AND CREDIT AND COLLECTABILITY

RISKS OF COUNTERPARTIES.

- 79 -

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS WERE WITH THE

INTERNATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF MACHINISTS AND AEROSPACE WORKERS (IAM) REPRESENTING

20% OF EMPLOYEES (CURRENT AGREEMENTS EXPIRING IN MAY 2004, AND SEPTEMBER AND

OCTOBER 2005); THE SOCIETY OF PROFESSIONAL ENGINEERING EMPLOYEES IN AEROSPACE

(SPEEA) REPRESENTING 13% OF EMPLOYEES (CURRENT AGREEMENTS EXPIRING FEBRUARY 2004

AND DECEMBER 2005); AND THE UNITED AUTOMOBILE, AEROSPACE AND AGRICULTURAL

IMPLEMENT WORKERS OF AMERICA (UAW) REPRESENTING 4% OF EMPLOYEES (CURRENT

AGREEMENTS EXPIRING MAY 2003, APRIL 2004, AND SEPTEMBER 2005).

NOTE 22 -

DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND

2001, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS $5,007 AND $5,156,

RESPECTIVELY, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE WAS ESTIMATED TO BE

$4,772 AND $5,054, RESPECTIVELY. THE LOWER FAIR VALUE REFLECTS A DISCOUNT DUE TO

DEFERRED COLLECTION FOR CERTAIN RECEIVABLES THAT WILL BE COLLECTED OVER AN

EXTENDED PERIOD. THE CARRYING VALUE OF ACCOUNTS PAYABLE IS ESTIMATED TO

APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF NOTES RECEIVABLE, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WAS $2,954

AND THE FAIR VALUE WAS ESTIMATED TO BE $3,258. AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2001, THE

CARRYING AMOUNT OF NOTES RECEIVABLE, NET OF VALUATION ALLOWANCE, WAS ESTIMATED

TO APPROXIMATE FAIR VALUE. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE GENERALLY NO QUOTED MARKET PRICES

AVAILABLE FOR CUSTOMER FINANCING NOTES RECEIVABLE, THE VALUATION ASSESSMENTS

WERE BASED ON THE RESPECTIVE INTEREST RATES, RISK-RELATED RATE SPREADS AND

COLLATERAL CONSIDERATIONS.

AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002 AND

2001, THE CARRYING AMOUNT OF DEBT, NET OF CAPITAL LEASES, WAS $13,704 AND

$11,805, RESPECTIVELY, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF DEBT, BASED ON CURRENT MARKET RATES

FOR DEBT OF THE SAME RISK AND MATURITIES, WAS ESTIMATED AT $14,604 AND $12,274,

RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANYS DEBT, HOWEVER, IS GENERALLY NOT CALLABLE UNTIL

MATURITY.

WITH REGARD TO FINANCIAL

INSTRUMENTS WITH OFF-BALANCE SHEET RISK, IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE TO ESTIMATE THE

FAIR VALUE OF FUTURE FINANCING COMMITMENTS BECAUSE THERE IS NOT A MARKET FOR

SUCH FUTURE COMMITMENTS. OTHER OFF-BALANCE SHEET FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS,

INCLUDING ASSET-RELATED GUARANTEES, CREDIT GUARANTEES, AND INTEREST RATE

GUARANTEES RELATED TO AN EQUIPMENT TRUST CERTIFICATE, ARE ESTIMATED TO HAVE A

FAIR VALUE OF $358 AT DECEMBER 31, 2002.

NOTE 23 -

CONTINGENCIES

LEGAL

VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS

AND INVESTIGATIONS RELATED TO PRODUCTS, CONTRACTS AND OTHER MATTERS ARE PENDING

AGAINST THE COMPANY. MOST SIGNIFICANT LEGAL PROCEEDINGS ARE RELATED TO MATTERS

COVERED BY INSURANCE. MAJOR CONTINGENCIES ARE DISCUSSED BELOW.

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

U.S. GOVERNMENT INVESTIGATIONS FROM WHICH CIVIL, CRIMINAL OR ADMINISTRATIVE

PROCEEDINGS COULD RESULT. SUCH PROCEEDINGS COULD INVOLVE CLAIMS BY THE

GOVERNMENT FOR FINES, PENALTIES, COMPENSATORY AND TREBLE DAMAGES, RESTITUTION

AND/OR FORFEITURES. UNDER GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS, A COMPANY, OR ONE OR MORE OF

ITS OPERATING DIVISIONS OR SUBDIVISIONS, CAN ALSO BE SUSPENDED OR DEBARRED FROM

GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, OR LOSE ITS EXPORT PRIVILEGES, BASED ON THE RESULTS OF

INVESTIGATIONS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES, BASED UPON ALL AVAILABLE INFORMATION, THAT

THE OUTCOME OF ANY SUCH GOVERNMENT DISPUTES AND INVESTIGATIONS WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON ITS FINANCIAL POSITION OR CONTINUING OPERATIONS.

IN 1991, THE U.S. NAVY

NOTIFIED MCDONNELL DOUGLAS (NOW A SUBSIDIARY OF THE COMPANY) AND GENERAL

DYNAMICS CORPORATION (THE TEAM) THAT IT WAS TERMINATING FOR DEFAULT

THE TEAMS CONTRACT FOR DEVELOPMENT AND INITIAL PRODUCTION OF THE A-12

AIRCRAFT. THE TEAM FILED A LEGAL ACTION TO CONTEST THE NAVYS DEFAULT

TERMINATION, TO ASSERT ITS RIGHTS TO CONVERT THE TERMINATION TO ONE FOR

THE CONVENIENCE OF THE GOVERNMENT, AND TO OBTAIN PAYMENT FOR WORK

DONE AND COSTS INCURRED ON THE A-12 CONTRACT BUT NOT PAID TO DATE. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002, INVENTORIES INCLUDED APPROXIMATELY $583 OF RECORDED COSTS ON

THE A-12 CONTRACT, AGAINST WHICH THE COMPANY HAS ESTABLISHED A LOSS PROVISION OF

$350. THE AMOUNT OF THE PROVISION, WHICH WAS ESTABLISHED IN 1990, WAS BASED ON

MCDONNELL DOUGLASS BELIEF, SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL,

THAT THE TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WOULD BE CONVERTED TO A TERMINATION FOR

CONVENIENCE, AND THAT THE BEST ESTIMATE OF POSSIBLE LOSS ON TERMINATION FOR

CONVENIENCE WAS $350.

ON AUGUST 31, 2001, THE

U.S. COURT OF FEDERAL CLAIMS ISSUED A DECISION AFTER TRIAL UPHOLDING THE U.S.

GOVERNMENTS DEFAULT TERMINATION OF THE A-12 CONTRACT ON THE GROUNDS THAT

THE TEAM COULD NOT MEET THE REVISED CONTRACT SCHEDULE UNILATERALLY IMPOSED BY

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE COURT DID NOT, HOWEVER, ENTER A MONEY JUDGMENT FOR THE

U.S. GOVERNMENT ON ITS CLAIM FOR UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS. THIS

FOLLOWED AN EARLIER TRIAL COURT DECISION IN FAVOR OF THE CONTRACTORS AND

REVERSAL OF THAT INITIAL DECISION ON APPEAL. THE TEAM APPEALED THAT

DECISION TO THE COURT OF APPEALS AND IS AWAITING A DECISION. THE TEAM ALSO

OBTAINED A STAY OF THE TRIAL COURTS JUDGMENT TO PREVENT THE NAVY FROM

COLLECTING ANY ALLEGEDLY DUE AMOUNTS PRIOR TO THE DECISION BY THE COURT OF

APPEALS.

- 80 -

IF, AFTER ALL JUDICIAL

PROCEEDINGS HAVE ENDED, THE COURTS DETERMINE CONTRARY TO THE COMPANYS

BELIEF THAT A TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT WAS APPROPRIATE, THE COMPANY WOULD INCUR

AN ADDITIONAL LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $275, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF REMAINING

INVENTORY COSTS AND ADJUSTMENTS, AND IF CONTRARY TO THE COMPANYS BELIEF

THE COURTS FURTHER HOLD THAT A MONEY JUDGMENT SHOULD BE ENTERED AGAINST THE

TEAM, THE COMPANY WOULD BE REQUIRED TO PAY THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ONE-HALF OF THE

UNLIQUIDATED PROGRESS PAYMENTS OF $1,350 PLUS STATUTORY INTEREST FROM FEBRUARY

1991 (CURRENTLY TOTALING APPROXIMATELY $1,040). THE LOSS TO THE COMPANY WOULD

TOTAL APPROXIMATELY $1,465 IN PRE-TAX CHARGES. SHOULD, HOWEVER, THE TRIAL

COURTS DECISION ON TERMINATION BE REVERSED ON APPEAL AND ITS 1998 JUDGMENT

IN FAVOR OF THE TEAM BE REINSTATED, THE COMPANY WOULD RECEIVE APPROXIMATELY

$957, INCLUDING INTEREST.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES,

SUPPORTED BY AN OPINION OF OUTSIDE COUNSEL, THAT THE TRIAL COURTS RULINGS

WITH RESPECT TO THE ENFORCEABILITY OF THE UNILATERAL SCHEDULE AND THE

TERMINATION FOR DEFAULT ARE CONTRARY TO LAW AND FACT AND THAT THE LOSS PROVISION

ESTABLISHED BY MCDONNELL DOUGLAS IN 1990 CONTINUES TO PROVIDE ADEQUATELY FOR THE

REASONABLY POSSIBLE REDUCTION IN VALUE OF A-12 NET CONTRACTS IN PROCESS AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2002. FINAL RESOLUTION OF THE A-12 LITIGATION WILL DEPEND UPON THE

OUTCOME OF FURTHER PROCEEDINGS OR POSSIBLE NEGOTIATIONS WITH THE U.S.

GOVERNMENT.

THE COMPANY IS A DEFENDANT

IN SEVEN EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION MATTERS IN WHICH CLASS CERTIFICATION IS

SOUGHT OR HAS BEEN GRANTED.  THREE MATTERS ARE PENDING IN THE FEDERAL

DISTRICT COURT FOR THE WESTERN DISTRICT OF WASHINGTON IN SEATTLE; ONE CASE IS

PENDING IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT FOR THE CENTRAL DISTRICT OF CALIFORNIA IN

LOS ANGELES; ONE CASE IS PENDING IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN ST. LOUIS,

MISSOURI; ONE CASE IS PENDING IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN TULSA, OKLAHOMA;

AND THE FINAL CASE IS PENDING IN THE FEDERAL DISTRICT COURT IN WICHITA, KANSAS.

THE COMPANY INTENDS TO CONTINUE ITS AGGRESSIVE DEFENSE OF THESE CASES. IT IS NOT

POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHAT IMPACT, IF ANY, THESE CASES COULD HAVE ON THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

OTHER CONTINGENCIES

THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO

FEDERAL AND STATE REQUIREMENTS FOR PROTECTION OF THE ENVIRONMENT, INCLUDING

THOSE FOR DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS MATERIALS AND REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED

SITES. DUE IN PART TO THEIR COMPLEXITY AND PERVASIVENESS, SUCH REQUIREMENTS HAVE

RESULTED IN THE COMPANY BEING INVOLVED WITH RELATED LEGAL PROCEEDINGS, CLAIMS

AND REMEDIATION OBLIGATIONS SINCE THE 1980S.

THE COMPANY ROUTINELY

ASSESSES, BASED ON IN-DEPTH STUDIES, EXPERT ANALYSES AND LEGAL REVIEWS, ITS

CONTINGENCIES, OBLIGATIONS AND COMMITMENTS FOR REMEDIATION OF CONTAMINATED

SITES, INCLUDING ASSESSMENTS OF RANGES AND PROBABILITIES OF RECOVERIES FROM

OTHER RESPONSIBLE PARTIES WHO HAVE AND HAVE NOT AGREED TO A SETTLEMENT AND OF

RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE CARRIERS. THE COMPANYS POLICY IS TO IMMEDIATELY

ACCRUE AND CHARGE TO CURRENT EXPENSE IDENTIFIED EXPOSURES RELATED TO

ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION SITES BASED ON ESTIMATES OF INVESTIGATION, CLEANUP AND

MONITORING COSTS TO BE INCURRED.

THE COSTS INCURRED AND

EXPECTED TO BE INCURRED IN CONNECTION WITH SUCH ACTIVITIES HAVE NOT HAD, AND ARE

NOT EXPECTED TO HAVE, A MATERIAL IMPACT TO THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL

POSITION. WITH RESPECT TO RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, RELATED CHARGES HAVE AVERAGED

LESS THAN 2% OF ANNUAL NET EARNINGS. SUCH ACCRUALS AS OF DECEMBER 31, 2002,

WITHOUT CONSIDERATION FOR THE RELATED CONTINGENT RECOVERIES FROM INSURANCE

CARRIERS, ARE LESS THAN 2% OF TOTAL LIABILITIES.

BECAUSE OF THE REGULATORY

COMPLEXITIES AND RISK OF UNIDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED SITES AND CIRCUMSTANCES, THE

POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR ENVIRONMENTAL REMEDIATION COSTS TO BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT

FROM THE ESTIMATED COSTS ACCRUED FOR IDENTIFIED CONTAMINATED SITES. HOWEVER,

BASED ON ALL KNOWN FACTS AND EXPERT ANALYSES, THE COMPANY BELIEVES IT IS NOT

REASONABLY LIKELY THAT IDENTIFIED ENVIRONMENTAL CONTINGENCIES WILL RESULT IN

ADDITIONAL COSTS THAT WOULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT TO THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION OR OPERATING RESULTS AND CASH FLOW TRENDS.

THE COMPANY HAS ENTERED

INTO STANDBY LETTERS OF CREDIT AGREEMENTS AND SURETY BONDS WITH FINANCIAL

INSTITUTIONS PRIMARILY RELATING TO THE GUARANTEE OF FUTURE PERFORMANCE ON

CERTAIN CONTRACTS. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES ON OUTSTANDING LETTERS OF CREDIT

AGREEMENTS AND SURETY BONDS AGGREGATED APPROXIMATELY $1,663 AT DECEMBER 31,

2002.

NOTE 24 -

FOR INTERNAL REPORTING

PURPOSES, THE COMPANY RECORDS COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT REVENUES AND

OPERATING PROFITS FOR AIRPLANES TRANSFERRED TO OTHER SEGMENTS, AND SUCH

TRANSFERS MAY INCLUDE AIRPLANES ACCOUNTED FOR AS OPERATING LEASES THAT ARE

CONSIDERED TRANSFERRED TO BCC. THE REVENUES FOR THESE TRANSFERS ARE ELIMINATED

IN THE ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS CAPTION. IN THE EVENT AN

AIRPLANE ACCOUNTED FOR AS AN OPERATING LEASE IS SUBSEQUENTLY SOLD, THE

ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS CAPTION WOULD REFLECT THE

RECOGNITION OF REVENUE AND OPERATING PROFIT FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

THE COMPANY RECORDS COST OF

SALES FOR 7-SERIES COMMERCIAL AIRPLANE PROGRAMS UNDER THE PROGRAM METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING DESCRIBED IN NOTE 1. FOR INTERNAL MEASUREMENT PURPOSES, THE

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT RECORDS COST OF SALES BASED ON THE COST OF SPECIFIC

UNITS DELIVERED, AND TO THE EXTENT THAT INVENTORIABLE COSTS EXCEED ESTIMATED

REVENUES, A LOSS IS NOT RECOGNIZED UNTIL DELIVERY IS MADE, WHICH IS NOT IN

ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. FOR THE 717 PROGRAM,

THE COST OF THE SPECIFIC UNITS DELIVERED IS REDUCED, ON A PER-UNIT BASIS, BY THE

AMOUNT PREVIOUSLY RECOGNIZED FOR FORWARD LOSSES. PROCEEDS FROM CERTAIN

COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES SEGMENT SUPPLIERS ATTRIBUTABLE TO PARTICIPATION IN

DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS A REDUCTION IN THE COST OF INVENTORY

RECEIVED FROM THE SUPPLIER UNDER THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING METHOD, AND AS AN

EXPENSE REDUCTION IN THE PERIOD THE PROCEEDS ARE RECEIVED FOR INTERNAL

MEASUREMENT PURPOSES. THESE ADJUSTMENTS BETWEEN THE INTERNAL MEASUREMENT METHOD

AND THE PROGRAM ACCOUNTING METHOD ARE INCLUDED IN THE ACCOUNTING

DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS CAPTION OF NET EARNINGS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS

TOTALED $(830), $(721) AND $(637) FOR THE YEARS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, 2001

AND 2000, RESPECTIVELY.

BCC SEGMENT REVENUES

CONSIST PRINCIPALLY OF INTEREST FROM FINANCING RECEIVABLES AND LEASE INCOME FROM

OPERATING LEASE EQUIPMENT. ADDITIONALLY, SEGMENT EARNINGS REFLECT DEPRECIATION

ON LEASED EQUIPMENT AND EXPENSES RECORDED AGAINST THE VALUATION ALLOWANCE

PRESENTED IN NOTE 10. NO INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEBT IS INCLUDED IN BCC

SEGMENT EARNINGS FOR 2002. BEGINNING IN 2003, INTEREST EXPENSE ON DEBT WILL BE

INCLUDED IN BCC SEGMENT EARNINGS.

THE COMPANY PROVIDES BCC

WITH CERTAIN INTERCOMPANY GUARANTEES AND OTHER SUBSIDIES. INTERCOMPANY

GUARANTEES PRIMARILY RELATE TO RESIDUAL VALUE GUARANTEES AND CREDIT GUARANTEES

(FIRST LOSS DEFICIENCY GUARANTEES AND RENTAL GUARANTEES). RESIDUAL VALUE

GUARANTEES PROVIDE BCC A SPECIFIED ASSET VALUE AT THE END OF A LEASE AGREEMENT

WITH A THIRD PARTY IN THE EVENT OF A DECLINE IN MARKET VALUE OF THE FINANCED

AIRCRAFT. FIRST LOSS DEFICIENCY GUARANTEES COVER A SPECIFIED PORTION OF

BCCS LOSSES ON FINANCED AIRCRAFT IN THE EVENT OF A LOSS UPON DISPOSITION

OF THE AIRCRAFT FOLLOWING A DEFAULT BY THE THIRD PARTY LESSEE. RENTAL GUARANTEES

ARE WHOLE OR PARTIAL GUARANTEES COVERING BCC AGAINST THE THIRD PARTY

LESSEES FAILURE TO PAY RENT UNDER THE LEASE AGREEMENT. IN ADDITION TO

GUARANTEES, OTHER SUBSIDIES ARE ALSO PROVIDED TO BCC MAINLY IN THE FORM OF

RENTAL PAYMENTS ON RESTRUCTURED THIRD PARTY LEASES AND INTEREST RATE SUBSIDIES.

AS A RESULT OF GUARANTEED

RESIDUAL VALUES OF ASSETS OR GUARANTEED INCOME STREAMS UNDER CREDIT GUARANTEES,

BCC IS ABATED FROM ASSET IMPAIRMENTS ON THE GUARANTEED AIRCRAFT TO THE EXTENT OF

GUARANTEE COVERAGE. IF AN ASSET IMPAIRMENT IS CALCULATED ON A GUARANTEED

AIRCRAFT, THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS GENERALLY RECORDED IN THE OTHER SEGMENT. IF

THE GUARANTEE AMOUNT IS INSUFFICIENT TO COVER THE FULL IMPAIRMENT LOSS, THE

SHORTAGE IS RECORDED BY BCC.

DUE TO INTERCOMPANY

GUARANTEES, THE BCC ACCOUNTING CLASSIFICATION OF CERTAIN THIRD PARTY LEASES MAY

DIFFER FROM THE ACCOUNTING CLASSIFICATION IN THE CONSOLIDATED COMPANY FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS (I.E. SALES-TYPE LEASE AT BCC, OPERATING LEASE IN THE CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; OR LEVERAGED LEASE AT BCC, SALES-TYPE LEASE IN THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS). IN THESE CASES, THE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT AT

BCC IS ELIMINATED AND THE IMPACT OF THE CONSOLIDATED ACCOUNTING TREATMENT IS

RECORDED IN THE OTHER SEGMENT.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE

PROVIDES THE FINANCIAL STATEMENT IMPACTS OF INTERCOMPANY GUARANTEES AND ASSET

IMPAIRMENTS, LEASE ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES, AND OTHER SUBSIDIES. THESE AMOUNTS

HAVE BEEN RECORDED IN THE OTHER SEGMENT.

DURING THE YEAR ENDED

DECEMBER 31, 2002, THE OTHER SEGMENT RECORDED ASSET IMPAIRMENT CHARGES OF $66

RELATED TO THE IMPAIRMENT OF A LONG-HELD INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT TRUST

CERTIFICATES SECURED BY AIRCRAFT ON LEASE TO UNITED AIRLINES, $66 RELATED TO THE

IMPAIRMENT OF 717S RETURNED TO THE COMPANY BY AMR, AND $80 RELATED TO AN

INCREASE IN THE CUSTOMER FINANCING VALUATION ALLOWANCE RESULTING FROM GUARANTEES

PROVIDED TO BCC. THE 717 IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS OFFSET BY A $60 AMR LEASE

TERMINATION FEE RECORDED IN EARNINGS DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER BY THE OTHER

SEGMENT IN THE LEASE ACCOUNTING DIFFERENCES CAPTION ABOVE.

THE ACCOUNTING

DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS CAPTION OF NET EARNINGS ALSO INCLUDES THE IMPACT

OF COST MEASUREMENT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

AND FEDERAL COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. THIS INCLUDES THE FOLLOWING: THE

DIFFERENCE BETWEEN PENSION COSTS RECOGNIZED UNDER SFAS NO. 87,

EMPLOYERS ACCOUNTING FOR PENSIONS

, AND UNDER FEDERAL COST

ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, PRINCIPALLY ON A FUNDING BASIS; THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN

RETIREE HEALTH CARE COSTS RECOGNIZED UNDER SFAS NO. 106,

EMPLOYERS

ACCOUNTING FOR POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS OTHER THAN PENSIONS

, AND UNDER

FEDERAL COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS, PRINCIPALLY ON A CASH BASIS; AND THE

DIFFERENCES IN TIMING OF COST RECOGNITION RELATED TO CERTAIN ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS

FACILITIES CONSOLIDATION, UNDERTAKEN AS A RESULT OF MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS

WHEREBY SUCH COSTS ARE EXPENSED UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

AND DEFERRED UNDER FEDERAL COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS. ADDITIONALLY, THE

AMORTIZATION OF COSTS CAPITALIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 34,

CAPITALIZATION OF INTEREST COST

, IS INCLUDED IN THE ACCOUNTING

DIFFERENCES/ELIMINATIONS CAPTION.

UNALLOCATED EXPENSE

INCLUDES CORPORATE COSTS NOT ALLOCATED TO THE OPERATING SEGMENTS, INCLUDING, FOR

THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2001, GOODWILL AMORTIZATION RESULTING FROM

ACQUISITIONS PRIOR TO 1998. FOR THE PERIOD ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2002, UNALLOCATED

EXPENSE DOES NOT INCLUDE GOODWILL AMORTIZATION AS A RESULT OF THE COMPANY

ADOPTING SFAS NO. 142, AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 5. UNALLOCATED EXPENSE ALSO INCLUDES

THE RECOGNITION OF AN EXPENSE OR A REDUCTION TO EXPENSE FOR DEFERRED STOCK

COMPENSATION PLANS RESULTING FROM STOCK PRICE CHANGES AS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 17.

THE COST ATTRIBUTABLE TO SHARE-BASED PLANS EXPENSE IS NOT ALLOCATED TO OTHER

BUSINESS SEGMENTS EXCEPT FOR THE PORTION RELATED TO BCC. DEPRECIATION AND

AMORTIZATION RELATE PRIMARILY TO SHARED SERVICES ASSETS.

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT FOR THE YEAR ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2000, INCLUDED $505 ASSOCIATED WITH

THE SPACE AND COMMUNICATIONS SEGMENT AND $52 ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMERCIAL

AIRPLANES SEGMENT.

UNALLOCATED ASSETS

PRIMARILY CONSIST OF CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, PREPAID PENSION EXPENSE,

GOODWILL ACQUIRED PRIOR TO 1997, DEFERRED TAX ASSETS, AND CAPITALIZED INTEREST.

UNALLOCATED LIABILITIES INCLUDE VARIOUS ACCRUED EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION AND

BENEFIT LIABILITIES, INCLUDING ACCRUED RETIREE HEALTH CARE, INCOME TAXES PAYABLE,
