arranges, structures and provides selective financing solutions for our commercial airplanes customers. in the space and defense markets, bcc primarily arranges and structures financing 2table of contentssolutions for our bds government and commercial satellite customers. bccs portfolio consists of equipment under operating leases, finance leases, notes and other receivables, assets held for sale or re-lease and investments.financial and other business informationsee the summary of business segment data and note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for financial information, including revenues and earnings from operations, for each of our business segments.intellectual propertywe own numerous patents and have licenses for the use of patents owned by others, which relate to our products and their manufacture. in addition to owning a large portfolio of intellectual property, we also license intellectual property to and from third parties. for example, the u.s. government has licenses in our patents that are developed in performance of government contracts, and it may use or authorize others to use the inventions covered by such patents for government purposes. unpatented research, development and engineering skills, as well as certain trademarks, trade secrets, and other intellectual property rights, also make an important contribution to our business. while our intellectual property rights in the aggregate are important to the operation of each of our businesses, we do not believe that our business would be materially affected by the expiration of any particular intellectual property right or termination of any particular intellectual property patent license agreement.non-u.s. revenuessee note 21 to our consolidated financial statements for information regarding non-u.s. revenues.research and developmentresearch and development expenditures involve experimentation, design, development and related test activities for defense systems, new and derivative jet aircraft including both commercial and military, advanced space and other company-sponsored product development. these are expensed as incurred including amounts allocable as reimbursable overhead costs on u.s. government contracts.our total research and development expense amounted to $3.1 billion, $3.3 billion and $3.9 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.research and development costs also include bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services, as well as costs incurred in excess of amounts estimated to be recoverable under cost-sharing research and development agreements. bid and proposal costs were $285 million, $326 million and $332 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.employeestotal workforce level at december31, 2013 was approximately 168,400.3table of contentsas of december31, 2013, our principal collective bargaining agreements were with the following unions:unionpercentofour

implement workers of america (uaw)2%we have one major agreement expiring in october of 2014 and one in february of 2015.competitionthe commercial jet aircraft market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. we face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share, such as airbus, embraer and bombardier, and other entrants from russia, china and japan. we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost reduction efforts. we intend to continue to compete with other airplane manufacturers by providing customers with greater value products, services, and support. we continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which span the life cycle of the airplane: aircraft acquisition, readying for service, maintenance and engineering, enhancing and upgrading, and transitioning to the next model - as well as the daily cycle of gate-to-gate operations. this enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity.bds faces strong competition in all market segments, primarily from lockheed martin corporation, northrop grumman corporation, raytheon company and general dynamics corporation. non-u.s. companies such as bae systems and airbus group (formerly european aeronautic defence and space company (eads)), continue to build a strategic presence in the u.s. market by strengthening their north american operations and partnering with u.s. defense companies. in addition, certain competitors have occasionally formed teams with other competitors to address specific customer requirements. bds expects the trend of strong competition to continue into 2014 with many international firms attempting to increase their u.s. presence.regulatory mattersour businesses are heavily regulated in most of our markets. we deal with numerous u.s. government agencies and entities, including but not limited to all of the branches of the u.s. military, nasa, the federal aviation administration (faa) and the department of homeland security. similar government authorities exist in our international markets.government contracts. the u.s. government, and other governments, may terminate any of our government contracts at their convenience, as well as for default, based on our failure to meet specified performance requirements. if any of our u.s. government contracts were to be terminated for convenience, we generally would be entitled to receive payment for work completed and allowable termination or cancellation costs. if any of our government contracts were to be terminated for default, generally the u.s. government would pay only for the work that has been accepted and can require us to pay the difference between the original contract price and the cost to re-procure the contract items, net of the work accepted from the original contract. the u.s. government can also hold us liable for damages resulting from the default.4table of contentscommercial aircraft. in the united states, our commercial aircraft products are required to comply with faa regulations governing production and quality systems, airworthiness and installation approvals, repair procedures and continuing operational safety. internationally, similar requirements exist for airworthiness, installation and operational approvals. these requirements are generally administered by the national aviation authorities of each country and, in the case of europe, coordinated by the european joint aviation authorities.environmental. we are subject to various federal, state, local and non-u.s. laws and regulations relating to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. we continually assess our compliance status and management of environmental matters to ensure our operations are in substantial compliance with all applicable environmental laws and regulations. investigation, remediation, operation and maintenance costs associated with environmental compliance and management of sites are a normal, recurring part of our operations. these costs often are allowable costs under our contracts with the u.s. government. it is reasonably possible that continued environmental compliance could have a material impact on our results of operations, financial condition or cash flows if additional work requirements or more stringent clean-up standards are imposed by regulators, new areas of soil and groundwater contamination are discovered and/or expansions of work scope are prompted by the results of investigations.a potentially responsible party (prp) has joint and several liability under existing u.s. environmental laws. where we have been designated a prp by the environmental protection agency or a state environmental agency, we are potentially liable to the government or third parties for the full cost of remediating contamination at our facilities or former facilities or at third-party sites. if we were required to fully fund the remediation of a site for which we were originally assigned a partial share, the statutory framework would allow us to pursue rights to contribution from other prps. for additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.international. our international sales are subject to u.s. and non-u.s. governmental regulations and procurement policies and practices, including regulations relating to import-export control, investment, exchange controls and repatriation of earnings. international sales are also subject to varying currency, political and economic risks.raw materials, parts, and subassemblieswe are highly dependent on the availability of essential materials, parts and subassemblies from our suppliers and subcontractors. the most important raw materials required for our aerospace products are aluminum (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions), titanium (sheet, plate, forgings and extrusions) and composites (including carbon and boron). although alternative sources generally exist for these raw materials, qualification of the sources could take one year or more. many major components and product equipment items are procured or subcontracted on a sole-source basis with a number of companies.supplierswe are dependent upon the ability of a large number of suppliers and subcontractors to meet performance specifications, quality standards and delivery schedules at our anticipated costs. while we maintain an extensive qualification and performance surveillance system to control risk associated with such reliance on third parties, failure of suppliers or subcontractors to meet commitments could adversely affect production schedules and program/contract profitability, thereby jeopardizing our ability to fulfill commitments to our customers. we are also dependent on the availability of energy sources, such as electricity, at affordable prices.5table of contentsseasonalityno material portion of our business is considered to be seasonal.executive officers of the registrantsee item 10. directors, executive officers and

investment in our common stock or debt securities involves risks and uncertainties and our actual results and future trends may differ materially from our past or projected future performance. we urge investors to consider carefully the risk factors described below in evaluating the information contained in this report.6table of contentsour commercial airplanes business depends heavily on commercial airlines, and is subject to unique risks.market conditions have a significant impact on demand for our commercial aircraft. the commercial aircraft market is predominantly driven by long-term trends in airline passenger and cargo traffic. the principal factors underlying long-term traffic growth are sustained economic growth and political stability both in developed and emerging markets. demand for our commercial aircraft is further influenced by airline profitability, availability of aircraft financing, world trade policies, government-to-government relations, technological changes, price and other competitive factors, fuel prices, terrorism, epidemics and environmental regulations. traditionally, the airline industry has been cyclical and very competitive and has experienced significant profit swings and constant challenges to be more cost competitive. in addition, availability of financing to non-u.s. customers depends in part on the export-import bank of the united states, whose current authorization expires at the end of september 2014. significant deterioration in the global economic environment, the airline industry generally, or in the financial stability of one or more of our major customers could result in fewer new orders for aircraft or could cause customers to seek to postpone or cancel contractual orders and/or payments to us, which could result in lower revenues, profitability and cash flows and a reduction in our contractual backlog. in addition, because our commercial aircraft backlog consists of aircraft scheduled for delivery over a period of several years, any of these macroeconomic, industry or customer impacts could unexpectedly affect deliveries over a long period.we enter into firm fixed-price aircraft sales contracts with indexed price escalation clauses which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns or if increases in our costs exceed the applicable escalation rate. commercial aircraft sales contracts are often entered into years before the aircraft are delivered. in order to account for economic fluctuations between the contract date and delivery date, aircraft pricing generally consists of a fixed amount as modified by an indexed price escalation formula. our revenue estimates are based on current expectations with respect to these escalation formulas, but the actual escalation amounts are outside of our control. escalation factors can fluctuate significantly from period to period. changes in escalation amounts can significantly impact revenues and operating margins in our commercial airplanes business.we derive a significant portion of our revenues from a limited number of commercial airlines. we can make no assurance that any customer will exercise purchase options, fulfill existing purchase commitments or purchase additional products or services from us. in addition, fleet decisions, airline consolidations or financial challenges involving any of our major commercial airline customers could significantly reduce our revenues and limit our opportunity to generate profits from those customers.our commercial airplanes business depends on our ability to maintain a healthy production system, achieve planned production rate targets, successfully develop new aircraft or new derivative aircraft, and meet or exceed stringent performance and reliability standards.the commercial aircraft business is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers, highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners, and stringent regulatory requirements and performance and reliability standards. in addition, the introduction of new aircraft programs and/or derivatives, such as the 787-9, 787-10, 737 max and 777x, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, testing, production and certification schedules. as a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy regulatory and customer requirements, and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks.we must meet planned production rate targets in order to satisfy customer demand and maintain our profitability. we continue to increase production rates for the 737 and 787 programs, while at the same time engaging in significant ongoing development of the 787-9, 787-10, 737 max and 777x aircraft. if production rate ramp-up efforts at any of our commercial aircraft assembly facilities are delayed or if our suppliers cannot timely deliver components to us at the rates necessary to achieve our planned rate 7table of contentsincreases, we may be unable to meet delivery schedules and the financial performance of one or more of our programs may suffer.operational challenges impacting the production system for one or more of our commercial aircraft programs could result in production delays and/or failure to meet customer demand for new aircraft, either of which would negatively impact our revenues and operating margins. our commercial aircraft production system is extremely complex. operational issues, including delays or defects in supplier components, failure to meet internal performance plans, or delays or failures to achieve required regulatory certifications, could result in significant out-of-sequence work and increased production costs, as well as delayed deliveries to customers, impacts to aircraft performance and/or increased warranty or fleet support costs. further, if we cannot efficiently and cost-effectively incorporate design changes into already-completed 787 production aircraft, we may face further profitability pressures on this program.if our commercial airplanes fail to satisfy performance and reliability requirements, we could face additional costs and/or lower revenues. developing and manufacturing commercial aircraft that meet or exceed our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulatory agencies, can be costly and technologically challenging. these challenges are particularly significant with newer aircraft programs. any failure of any boeing aircraft to satisfy performance or reliability requirements could result in disruption to our operations, higher costs and/or lower revenues.changes in levels of u.s. government defense spending or overall acquisition priorities could negatively impact our financial position and results of operations.we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the u.s. government, primarily from defense related programs with the u.s. dod. levels of u.s. defense spending in future periods are very difficult to predict and subject to significant risks. in addition, significant budgetary delays and constraints have already resulted in reduced spending levels, and additional reductions may be forthcoming. in august 2011, the budget control act (the act) established limits on u.s. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 u.s. government fiscal years. the act also provided that the defense budget would face sequestration cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. the impact of sequestration cuts was reduced with respect to fy2014 and fy2015 following the enactment of the bipartisan budget act in december 2013. however, significant uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that u.s. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure, including risk of future sequestration cuts.in addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the u.s. dod and other government agencies (including nasa) within the overall budgetary framework described above. while the fy2014 appropriations finalized in january 2014 included funding for boeings major programs, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in fy2015 and beyond will affect boeings programs. we also expect that ongoing concerns regarding the u.s. national debt will continue to place downward pressure on u.s. dod spending levels. future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. in addition, as a result of the significant ongoing uncertainty with respect to both u.s. defense spending levels and the nature of the threat environment, we expect the u.s. dod to continue to emphasize cost-cutting and other efficiency initiatives in its procurement processes. if we can no longer adjust successfully to these changing acquisition priorities and/or fail to meet affordability targets set by the u.s. dod customer, our revenues and market share would be further impacted.8table of contentswe conduct a significant portion of our business pursuant to u.s. government contracts, which are subject to unique risks.in 2013, 34% of our revenues were earned pursuant to u.s. government contracts, which include foreign military sales through the u.s. government. business conducted pursuant to such contracts is subject to extensive procurement regulations and other unique risks.our sales to the u.s. government are subject to extensive procurement regulations, and changes to those regulations could increase our costs. new procurement regulations, or changes to existing requirements, could increase our compliance costs or otherwise have a material impact on the operating margins of our bds business. these requirements may result in increased compliance costs, and we could be subject to additional costs in the form of withheld payments and/or reduced future business if we fail to comply with these requirements in the future. compliance costs attributable to current and potential future procurement regulations such as these could negatively impact our financial condition and operating results.the u.s. government may modify, curtail or terminate one or more of our contracts. the u.s. government contracting party may modify, curtail or terminate its contracts and subcontracts with us, without prior notice and either at its convenience or for default based on performance. for example, in 2011, the u.s. army terminated for convenience the entire bctm program. in addition, funding pursuant to our u.s. government contracts may be reduced or withheld as part of the u.s. congressional appropriations process due to fiscal constraints, changes in u.s. national security strategy and/or priorities or other reasons. further uncertainty with respect to ongoing programs could also result in the event that the u.s. government finances its operations through temporary funding measures such as continuing resolutions rather than full-year appropriations. any loss or anticipated loss or reduction of expected funding and/or modification, curtailment, or termination of one or more large programs could have a material adverse effect on our earnings, cash flow and/or financial position.we are subject to u.s. government inquiries and investigations, including periodic audits of costs that we determine are reimbursable under u.s. government contracts. u.s. government agencies, including the defense contract audit agency and the defense contract management agency, routinely audit government contractors. these agencies review our performance under contracts, cost structure and compliance with applicable laws, regulations, and standards, as well as the adequacy of and our compliance with our internal control systems and policies. any costs found to be misclassified or inaccurately allocated to a specific contract will be deemed non-reimbursable, and to the extent already reimbursed, must be refunded. any inadequacies in our systems and policies could result in withholds on billed receivables, penalties and reduced future business. furthermore, if any audit, inquiry or investigation uncovers improper or illegal activities, we could be subject to civil and criminal penalties and administrative sanctions, including termination of contracts, forfeiture of profits, suspension of payments, fines, and suspension or debarment from doing business with the u.s. government. we also could suffer reputational harm if allegations of impropriety were made against us, even if such allegations are later determined to be false.we enter into fixed-price contracts which could subject us to losses if we have cost overruns.our bds business generated approximately 70% of its 2013 revenues from fixed-price contracts. while firm fixed price contracts enable us to benefit from performance improvements, cost reductions and efficiencies, they also subject us to the risk of reduced margins or incurring losses if we are unable to achieve estimated costs and revenues. if our estimated costs exceed our estimated price, we recognize reach-forward losses which can significantly affect our reported results. the long term nature of many of our contracts makes the process of estimating costs and revenues on fixed-price contracts inherently risky. fixed-price contracts often contain price incentives and penalties tied to performance which can be difficult to estimate and have significant impacts on margins. in addition, some of our contracts have specific provisions relating to cost, schedule and performance.9table of contentsfixed-price development contracts are generally subject to more uncertainty than fixed-price production contracts. many of these development programs have highly complex designs. in addition, technical or quality issues that arise during development could lead to schedule delays and higher costs to complete, which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. examples of significant bds fixed-price development contracts include aew&c, india p-8i, saudi f-15, usaf kc-46a tanker, and commercial and military satellites.we enter into cost-type contracts which also carry risks.our bds business generated approximately 30% of its 2013 revenues from cost-type contracting arrangements. some of these are development programs that have complex design and technical challenges. these cost-type programs typically have award or incentive fees that are subject to uncertainty and may be earned over extended periods. in these cases the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise.programs whose contracts are primarily cost-typeinclude gmd, proprietary and sls programs.we enter into contracts that include in-orbit incentive payments that subject us to risks.contracts in the commercial satellite industry and certain government satellite contracts include in-orbit incentive payments. these in-orbit payments may be paid over time after final satellite acceptance or paid in full prior to final satellite acceptance. in both cases, the in-orbit incentive payment is at riskif the satellite does not perform to specifications for up to 15 years after acceptance. the net present value of in-orbit incentive feeswe ultimately expect to realizeis recognized as revenue in the construction period. if the satellite fails to meet contractual performance criteria, customers will not be obligated to continue making in-orbit payments and/or we may be required toprovide refunds to the customerand incur significant charges.our ability to deliver products and services that satisfy customer requirements is heavily dependent on the performance of our subcontractors and suppliers, as well as on the availability of raw materials and other components.we rely on other companies including subcontractors and suppliers to provide and produce raw materials, integrated components and sub-assemblies, and production commodities and to perform some of the services that we provide to our customers. if one or more of our suppliers or subcontractors experiences delivery delays or other performance problems, we may be unable to meet commitments to our customers or incur additional costs. in addition, if one or more of the raw materials on which we depend (such as aluminum, titanium or composites) becomes unavailable or is available only at very high prices, we may be unable to deliver one or more of our products in a timely fashion or at budgeted costs. in some instances, we depend upon a single source of supply. any service disruption from one of these suppliers, either due to circumstances beyond the suppliers control or as a result of performance problems or financial difficulties, could have a material adverse effect on our ability to meet commitments to our customers or increase our operating costs.we use estimates in accounting for many contracts and programs. changes in our estimates could adversely affect our future financial results.contract and program accounting require judgment relative to assessing risks, estimating revenues and costs and making assumptions for schedule and technical issues. due to the size and nature of many of our contracts and programs, the estimation of total revenues and cost at completion is complicated and subject to many variables. assumptions have to be made regarding the length of time to complete the contract or program because costs also include expected increases in wages and employee benefits, material prices and allocated fixed costs. incentives or penalties related to performance on contracts are 10table of contentsconsidered in estimating sales and profit rates, and are recorded when there is sufficient information for us to assess anticipated performance. suppliers assertions are also assessed and considered in estimating costs and profit rates. estimates of award fees are also used in sales and profit rates based on actual and anticipated awards.with respect to each of our commercial aircraft programs, inventoriable production costs (including overhead), program tooling and other non-recurring costs and routine warranty costs are accumulated and charged as cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. a program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates. to establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a)the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b)the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced and (c)the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program. several factors determine accounting quantity, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. changes to customer or model mix, production costs and rates, learning curve, escalation, costs of derivative aircraft, supplier performance, customer negotiations/settlements, supplier claims and/or certification issues can impact these estimates. any such change in estimates relating to program accounting may adversely affect future financial performance.because of the significance of the judgments and estimation processes described above, materially different sales and profit amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. changes in underlying assumptions, circumstances or estimates may adversely affect future period financial performance. for additional information on our accounting policies for recognizing sales and profits, see our discussion under managements discussion and analysis  critical accounting policies  contract accounting/program accounting on pages 44  45 and note 1 to our consolidated financial statements on pages 55  65 of this form10-k.competition within our markets may reduce our future contracts and sales.the markets in which we operate are highly competitive and one or more of our competitors may have more extensive or more specialized engineering, manufacturing and marketing capabilities than we do in some areas. in our commercial airplanes business, we anticipate increasing competition among non-u.s. aircraft manufacturers and service providers in one or more of our market segments. in our bds business, we anticipate that the effects of defense industry consolidation and new priorities, including long-term cost competitiveness, of our u.s. dod customer will intensify competition for many of our products and services. furthermore, we are facing increased international competition and cross-border consolidation of competition. there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete successfully against our current or future competitors or that the competitive pressures we face will not result in reduced revenues and market share.we derive a significant portion of our revenues from non-u.s. sales and are subject to the risks of doing business in other countries.in 2013, non-u.s. customers accounted for approximately 57% of our revenues. we expect that non-u.s. sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues for the foreseeable future. as a result, we are subject to risks of doing business internationally, including:changes in regulatory requirements;domestic and international government policies, including requirements to expend a portion of program funds locally and governmental industrial cooperation or participation requirements;fluctuations in international currency exchange rates;11table of contentsvolatility in international political and economic environments and changes in non-u.s. national priorities and budgets, which can lead to delays or fluctuations in orders;the complexity and necessity of using non-u.s. representatives and consultants;the uncertainty of the ability of non-u.s. customers to finance purchases, including the availability of financing from the export-import bank of the united states;uncertainties and restrictions concerning the availability of funding credit or guarantees;imposition of domestic and international taxes, export controls, tariffs, embargoes and other trade restrictions;the difficulty of management and operation of an enterprise spread over many countries;compliance with a variety of international laws, as well as u.s. laws affecting the activities of u.s. companies abroad; andunforeseen developments and conditions, including terrorism, war and international conflicts.while the impact of these factors is difficult to predict, any one or more of these factors could adversely affect our operations in the future.the outcome of litigation and of government inquiries and investigations involving our business is unpredictable and an adverse decision in any such matter could have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations.we are involved in a number of litigation matters. these claims may divert financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit our operations. no assurances can be given that the results of these matters will be favorable to us. an adverse resolution of any of these lawsuits could have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations. in addition, we are sometimes subject to government inquiries and investigations of our business due, among other things, to our business relationships with the u.s. government, the heavily regulated nature of our industry, and in the case of environmental proceedings, our ownership of certain property. any such inquiry or investigation could potentially result in an adverse ruling against us, which could have a material impact on our financial position and operating results.a significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers based in the united states, and in certain types of boeing aircraft, which exposes us to concentration risks.a significant portion of our customer financing portfolio is concentrated among certain customers and in distinct geographic regions, particularly in the united states. our portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across boeing aircraft product types, most notably 717 aircraft. if one or more customers holding a significant portion of our portfolio assets experiences financial difficulties or otherwise defaults on or does not renew its leases with us at their expiration, and we are unable to redeploy the aircraft on reasonable terms, or if the types of aircraft that are concentrated in our portfolio suffer greater than expected declines in value, our earnings, cash flows and/or financial position could be materially adversely affected.we may be unable to obtain debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments at competitive rates, on commercially reasonable terms or in sufficient amounts.we depend, in part, upon the issuance of debt to fund our operations and contractual commitments. as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, our airplane financing commitments totaled $17,987 million and $18,083 million. if we require additional funding in order to fund outstanding financing commitments or meet other business requirements, our market liquidity may not be sufficient. a number of factors could cause us to incur increased borrowing costs and to have greater difficulty accessing public and private markets for 12table of contentsdebt. these factors include disruptions or declines in the global capital markets and/or a decline in our financial performance, outlook or credit ratings. the occurrence of any or all of these events may adversely affect our ability to fund our operations and contractual or financing commitments.we may not realize the anticipated benefits of mergers, acquisitions, joint ventures/strategic alliances or divestitures.as part of our business strategy, we may merge with or acquire businesses and/or form joint ventures and strategic alliances. whether we realize the anticipated benefits from these acquisitions and related activities depends, in part, upon our ability to integrate the operations of the acquired business, the performance of the underlying product and service portfolio, and the performance of the management team and other personnel of the acquired operations. accordingly, our financial results could be adversely affected from unanticipated performance issues, legacy liabilities, transaction-related charges, amortization of expenses related to intangibles, charges for impairment of long-term assets, credit guarantees, partner performance and indemnifications. consolidations of joint ventures could also impact our reported results of operations or financial position. while we believe that we have established appropriate and adequate procedures and processes to mitigate these risks, there is no assurance that these transactions will be successful. we also may make strategic divestitures from time to time. these transactions may result in continued financial involvement in the divested businesses, such as through guarantees or other financial arrangements, following the transaction. nonperformance by those divested businesses could affect our future financial results through additional payment obligations, higher costs or asset write-downs.our insurance coverage may be inadequate to cover all significant risk exposures.we are exposed to liabilities that are unique to the products and services we provide. we maintain insurance for certain risks and, in some circumstances, we may receive indemnification from the u.s. government. the amount of our insurance coverage may not cover all claims or liabilities and we may be forced to bear substantial costs. for example, liabilities arising from the use of certain of our products, such as aircraft technologies, missile systems, border security systems, anti-terrorism technologies, and/or air traffic management systems may not be insurable on commercially reasonable terms. while some of these products are shielded from liability within the u.s. under the safety act provisions of the 2002 homeland security act, no such protection is available outside the u.s., potentially resulting in significant liabilities. the amount of insurance coverage we maintain may be inadequate to cover these or other claims or liabilities.business disruptions could seriously affect our future sales and financial condition or increase our costs and expenses.our business may be impacted by disruptions including threats to physical security, information technology or cyber-attacks or failures, damaging weather or other acts of nature and pandemics or other public health crises. any of these disruptions could affect our internal operations or our ability to deliver products and services to our customers. any significant production delays, or any destruction, manipulation or improper use of our data, information systems or networks could impact our sales, increase our expenses and/or have an adverse effect on the reputation of boeing and of our products and services.some of our and our suppliers workforces are represented by labor unions, which may lead to work stoppages.approximately 65,000 employees, which constitute 38% of our total workforce, are union represented as of december31, 2013. we experienced a work stoppage in 2008 when a labor strike halted commercial aircraft and certain bma program production. we may experience additional work stoppages in the future, which could adversely affect our business. we cannot predict how stable our relationships, currently with 13table of contents11 u.s. labor organizations and 6 non-u.s. labor organizations, will be or whether we will be able to meet the unions requirements without impacting our financial condition. the unions may also limit our flexibility in dealing with our workforce. union actions at suppliers can also affect us. work stoppages and instability in our union relationships could delay the production and/or development of our products, which could strain relationships with customers and cause a loss of revenues which would adversely affect our operations.we have substantial pension and other postretirement benefit obligations, which have a material impact on our earnings, shareholders' equity and cash flows from operations and could have significant adverse impacts in future periods.we have qualified defined benefit pension plans that cover the majority of our employees. potential pension contributions include both mandatory amounts required under the employee retirement income security act and discretionary contributions to improve the plans' funded status. the extent of future contributions depends heavily on market factors such as the discount rate and the actual return on plan assets. we estimate future contributions to these plans using assumptions with respect to these and other items. changes to those assumptions could have a significant effect on future contributions as well as on our annual pension costs and/or result in a significant change to shareholders' equity. for u.s. government contracts, we allocate pension costs to individual contracts based on u.s. cost accounting standards which can also affect contract profitability. we also provide other postretirement benefits to certain of our employees, consisting principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. our estimates of future costs associated with these benefits are also subject to assumptions, including estimates of the level of medical cost increases. for a discussion regarding how our financial statements can be affected by pension and other postretirement plan accounting policies, see management's discussion and analysis-critical accounting policies-pension plans on page 46 of this form 10-k. although gaap expense and pension or other postretirement benefit contributions are not directly related, the key economic factors that affect gaap expense would also likely affect the amount of cash or stock we would contribute to our plans.our operations expose us to the risk of material environmental liabilities.we are subject to various federal, state, local and non-u.s. laws and regulations related to environmental protection, including the discharge, treatment, storage, disposal and remediation of hazardous substances and wastes. we could incur substantial costs, including cleanup costs, fines and civil or criminal sanctions, as well as third-party claims for property damage or personal injury, if we were to violate or become liable under environmental laws or regulations. in some cases, we may be subject to such costs due to environmental impacts attributable to our current or past manufacturing operations or the operations of companies we have acquired. in other cases, we may become subject to such costs due to an indemnification agreement between us and a third party relating to such environmental liabilities. in addition, new laws and regulations, more stringent enforcement of existing laws and regulations, the discovery of previously unknown contamination or the imposition of new remediation requirements could result in additional costs. for additional information relating to environmental contingencies, see note 11 to our consolidated financial statements.unauthorized access to our or our customers information and systems could negatively impact our business.we face certain security threats, including threats to the confidentiality, availability and integrity of our data and systems. we maintain an extensive network of technical security controls, policy enforcement mechanisms and monitoring systems in order to address these threats. while these measures are designed to prevent, detect and respond to unauthorized activity in our systems, certain types of attacks could result insignificant financial or information losses and/or reputational harm. in addition, we manage information 14table of contentstechnology systems for certain customers. many of these customers face similar security threats. if we cannot prevent the unauthorized access, release and/or corruption of our customers confidential, classified or personally identifiable information, our reputation could be damaged, and/or we could face financial losses.item1b. unresolved staff commentsnot applicableitem2. propertieswe occupied approximately 83 million square feet of floor space

airline industry and one of the largest defense contractors in the u.s. while our principal operations are in the u.s., we conduct operations in many countries and rely on an extensive network of international partners, key suppliers and subcontractors.our strategy is centered on successful execution in healthy core businesses  commercial airplanes and defense, space& security (bds)  supplemented and supported by boeing capital (bcc). taken together, these core businesses have historically generated substantial earnings and cash flow that permit us to invest in new products and services. we focus on producing the products and providing the services that the market demands and we price our products and services to provide a fair return for our shareholders while continuing to find new ways to improve efficiency and quality. commercial airplanes is committed to being the leader in commercial aviation by offering airplanes and services that deliver superior design, efficiency and value to customers around the world. bds integrates its resources in defense, intelligence, communications, security and space to deliver capability-driven solutions to its customers at reduced costs. our bds strategy is to leverage our core businesses to capture key next-generation programs while expanding our presence in adjacent and international markets, underscored by an intense

47.deferred compensation expense increased by $163 million in 2013, primarily driven by increases in our stock price, and by $14 million in 2012, primarily driven by increases in the overall stock market performance.eliminations and other unallocated expense decreased by $91 million in 2013, primarily due to the timing of elimination of profit on intercompany items, and increased by $130 million in 2012 due to the timing of intercompany expense allocations and elimination of profit on intercompany items.litigation settlements include the 2013 charge of $406 million related to the settlement of the a-12 litigation described in note 20 and the $121 million benefit recorded in 2012 due to a favorable court judgment on satellite litigation.we recorded net periodic benefit cost related to pension and other postretirement benefits of $3,769 million, $3,383 million and $3,127 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. the increase in net periodic benefit cost related to pension is primarily due to higher amortization of actuarial losses and higher service costs driven by lower discount rates. unallocated pension expense in 2013 reflects the pension curtailment charge of $73 million related to the decision in september 2013 to end production of the c-17 aircraft in 2015. see note 11. during the third quarter of 2013 we also determined that the pension expense in prior years was overstated and recorded a reduction in pension expense of $63 million. unallocated other postretirement benefit expense in 2011 includes $161 million of additional expense due to an adjustment primarily related to prior years accumulated postretirement benefit obligations. see the discussion of the postretirement liabilities in note 14 to our consolidated financial statements.

to research tax credits for the 2013 and 2012 tax years that were both recorded in 2013 and research and experimental regulations issued by the internal revenue service in 2013 which resulted in $212 million of previously unrecognized tax benefits being recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013. our 2011 effective tax rate was lower primarily due to tax benefits of $397 million recorded as a result of federal income tax audit settlements in addition to research tax credits which were not available in 2012. federal income tax audits have been settled for all years prior to 2007. for additional discussion related to income taxes, see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.22table of contentsbacklogour backlog at december31 was as follows:(dollars in millions)201320122011contractual

excludes purchase options, announced orders for which definitive contracts have not been executed, and unobligated u.s. and non-u.s. government contract funding. the increase in contractual backlog during 2013 and 2012 was primarily due to commercial aircraft orders in excess of deliveries partially offset by cancellation of orders. unobligated backlog includes u.s. and non-u.s. government definitive contracts for which funding has not been authorized. unobligated backlog increased during 2013 compared to 2012 primarily due to ch-47 chinook and v-22 osprey multi-year contract awards. the increase was partially offset by reclassifications to contractual backlog related to incremental funding for the usaf kc-46a tanker and f-15 multi-year contracts. the increase in unobligated backlog during 2012 was due to increases at bds of $2,720 million compared with 2011 primarily due to f-15 orders and the contract award for the space launch system program received in 2012. additional considerationskc-46a tanker in 2011, we were awarded a contract from the u.s. air force (usaf) to design, develop, manufacture and deliver 4 next generation aerial refueling tankers. the kc-46a tanker is a derivative of our 767 commercial aircraft. this contract is a fixed-price incentive firm contract valued at $4.9 billion andinvolves highly complex designs and systems integration. changes to our estimated cost to perform the work could result in a material charge. this contract contains production options.if all options under the contract are exercised, we expect to deliver 179 aircraft for a total expected contract value of approximately $30 billion. for segment reporting purposes, backlog, revenues and costs are recorded in the commercial airplanes and bma segments.23table of contentssegment results of operations and financial conditioncommercial airplanesbusiness environment and trendsairline industry environment global economic activity and global trade, which are the primary drivers of air travel and air cargo growth, grew below the long-term average for the second year in a row in 2013. despite this, passenger traffic grew by 5% annually in 2012 and 2013 and is forecast to continue at or near the long-term trend of 5% in 2014. there continues to be significant variation between regions and airline business models, with airlines operating in emerging economies and low-cost-carriers leading growth. in contrast, air cargo traffic declined in 2012 and grew by an estimated 1 to 2% in 2013 with continued improvement projected in 2014. the relative weakness of the air cargo market has impacted near-term demand for new freighter aircraft and freighter conversions, and we continue to monitor the impact of this trend on our business.airline financial performance also plays a role in the demand for new capacity. airlines continue to focus on increasing revenue through alliances, partnerships, new marketing initiatives, and effective leveraging of ancillary services and related revenues. airlines are also relentlessly focusing on reducing costs by renewing fleets to leverage more fuel efficient airplanes and by employing efficiency generating service offerings in a high-fuel-price environment. net profits for the global airline industry are estimated to total $13 billion in 2013 compared to $7 billion in 2012. nonetheless, these profit levels reflect low profit margins for the industry, and risk remains due to ongoing economic and political uncertainty. the long-term outlook for the industry remains positive due to the fundamental drivers of air travel growth: economic growth and the increasing propensity to travel due to increased trade, globalization, and improved airline services driven by liberalization of air traffic rights between countries. our 20-year forecast is for a long-term average growth rate of 5%per year for passenger and cargo traffic, based on a projected average annual worldwide real economic growth rate of 3%. based on long-term global economic growth projections, and factoring in increased utilization of the worldwide airplane fleet and requirements to replace older airplanes, we project a $4.8 trillion market for 35,000 new airplanes over the next 20 years.the industry remains vulnerable to near-term exogenous developments including fuel price spikes, credit market shocks, terrorism, natural disasters, conflicts, and increased global environmental regulations.industry competitiveness the commercial jet airplane market and the airline industry remain extremely competitive. market liberalization in europe and asia is enabling low-cost airlines to continue gaining market share. these airlines are increasing the pressure on airfares. this results in continued cost pressures for all airlines and price pressure on our products. major productivity gains are essential to ensure a favorable market position at acceptable profit margins.continued access to global markets remains vital to our ability to fully realize our sales potential and long-term investment returns. approximately 14% of commercial airplanes contractual backlog, in dollar terms, is with u.s. airlines, including cargo carriers.we face aggressive international competitors who are intent on increasing their market share. they offer competitive products and have access to most of the same customers and suppliers. with government support, airbus has historically invested heavily to create a family of products to compete with ours. regional jet makers embraer and bombardier, coming from the less than 100-seat commercial jet market, continue to develop larger and more capable airplanes. additionally, other competitors from russia, china and japan are developing commercial jet aircraft in the market above 90 seats. many ofthese competitors have historically enjoyed access to government-provided financial support, including launch aid, which greatly reduces the commercial risks associated withairplane development activities and enablesairplanes to be brought to market more quickly than otherwise possible. this market environment 24table of contentshas resulted in intense pressures on pricing and other competitive factors, and we expect these pressures to continue or intensify in the coming years.worldwide, airplane sales are generally conducted in u.s. dollars. fluctuating exchange rates affect the profit potential of our major competitors, all of whom have significant costs in other currencies. changes in value of the u.s. dollar relative to their local currencies impact competitors revenues and profits. competitors routinely respond to a relatively weaker u.s. dollar by aggressively reducing costs and increasing productivity, thereby improving their longer-term competitive posture. if the u.s. dollar strengthens, competitors can use the improved efficiency to fund product development, gain market share through pricing and/or improve earnings.we are focused on improving our processes and continuing cost-reduction efforts. we continue to leverage our extensive customer support services network which includes aviation support, spares, training, maintenance documents and technical advice for airlines throughout the world. this enables us to provide a high level of customer satisfaction and productivity. these efforts enhance our ability to pursue pricing strategies that enable us to price competitively.operating results(dollars in millions)years ended

earnings from operations in 2013 increased by $1,084 million or 23% compared with 2012. earnings increased by $842 million primarily driven by higher new airplane deliveries and lower research and development cost of $242 million due to lower spending on the 787 program partially offset by higher spending on the 737 max and 777x. operating margins increased from 9.6% in 2012 to 10.9% in 2013 primarily due to higher deliveries and lower research and development cost partially offset by the dilutive impact of 787 deliveries.earnings from operations in 2012 increased by $1,216 million or 35% compared with 2011. this was primarily due to higher new airplane deliveries, which drove an increase in earnings of $1,292 million, and lower research and development expense of $666 million primarily due to lower spending on the 747-8 and 787-8 programs. these increases were partially offset by lower earnings of $742 million driven by higher fleet support costs, increased operating costs associated with business growth, other period costs and decreased earnings from commercial aviation services. the decrease in operating margins from 9.7% in 2011 to 9.6% in 2012 was primarily due to the dilutive effect of the 787 and 747-8 deliveries.backlog firm backlog represents orders for products and services where no contingencies remain before we and the customer are required to perform. backlog does not include prospective orders where customer controlled contingencies remain, such as the customers receiving approval from their board of directors, shareholders or government and completing financing arrangements. all such contingencies must be satisfied or have expired prior to recording a new firm order even if satisfying such conditions is highly certain. firm orders exclude options. a number of our customers may have contractual remedies that may be implicated by program delays. we continue to address customer claims and requests for other contractual relief as they arise. however, once orders are included in firm backlog, orders remain in backlog until canceled or fulfilled, although the value of orders is adjusted as changes to price and schedule are agreed to with customers.the increase in contractual backlog during 2013 and 2012 was due to orders in excess of deliveries partially reduced by cancellation of orders and changes in projected revenue escalation. the decrease in unobligated backlog in 2013 was due to the reclassification from unobligated to contractual backlog related to incremental funding of the existing multi-year contract for commercial airplanes share of the usaf kc-46a tanker contract.accounting quantity the accounting quantity is our estimate of the quantity of airplanes that will be produced for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. it is a key determinant of the gross margins we recognize on sales of individual airplanes throughout a programs life. estimation of each programs accounting quantity takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for that program, including firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers and market studies. we review our program accounting quantities quarterly.the accounting quantity for each program may include units that have been delivered, undelivered units under contract, and units anticipated to be under contract in the reasonable future (anticipated orders). in developing total program estimates, all of these items within the accounting quantity must be considered.26table of contentsthe following table provides details of the accounting quantities and firm orders by program as of december31. cumulative firm orders represent the cumulative number of commercial jet aircraft deliveries plus undelivered firm

program increased by 400 units during 2013 due to the programs normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. the accounting quantity includes ng and max units. we increased our production rate from 35 to 38 per month in the first quarter of 2013 and a further increase to 42 per month is planned for the second quarter of 2014. on october 31, 2013, we announced plans to increase production of the 737 to 47 airplanes per month beginning in 2017. first delivery of the 737 max is expected in 2017.747 program continued weakness in the air cargo market and lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger aircraft have resulted in pricing pressures and fewer orders than anticipated.we continued to produce at a rate of 2 per month during 2013. in april 2013, we announced that the production rate would be decreased from 2 per month to 1.75 per month starting january 2014 and in october 2013 we announced that we would further reduce the production rate to 1.5 per month from february 2014 through the end of 2015. we continue to have a number of unsold 747 production positions and remain focused on obtaining additional orders, reducing out-of-sequence work, improving supply chain efficiency and implementing cost-reduction efforts. if market and production risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face a reach-forward loss that may be material.767 program the accounting quantity for the 767 program increased by 10 units during 2013 due to the programs normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. during the third quarter of 2013 we reconfigured the 767 assembly line to include a 767 derivative to support the tanker program and decreased our production rate from 2 to 1 per month. we expect to increase the commercial rate to 1.5 per month in 2014 and back to 2 per month in 2016.777 program the accounting quantity for the 777 program increased by 100 units during 2013 due to the programs normal progress of obtaining additional orders and delivering airplanes. we increased our production rate from 7 to 8.3 per month in the first quarter of 2013. in november 2013 we launched the 777x and first delivery is expected in 2020.27table of contents787 program we delivered 65 aircraft in 2013 bringing cumulative deliveries to 114. in january 2013, following battery-related incidents on two 787 aircraft, the federal aviation administration required u.s. aircraft operators to suspend operations of all 787 aircraft. international government regulators also issued directives to the same effect. we continued production but suspended deliveries until appropriate clearances were granted. during the second quarter, we installed a comprehensive set of battery system improvements on 50 previously-delivered 787 airplanes and resumed 787 deliveries to customers. in may 2013, we achieved a production rate of 7 per month in final assembly. we began the production rate increase to 10 per month in final assembly in november 2013 with first deliveries expected to occur at that rate in early 2014. the first 787-9 derivative began final assembly in may 2013 and completed first flight on september 17, 2013. production and flight testing of the 787-9 continues to be on schedule and we expect the first customer delivery to occur in mid-2014. in june 2013, we announced the launch of the 787-10 derivative aircraft with first delivery targeted for 2018.we continue to incorporate engineering and other design changes identified during 787-8 flight testing into already completed aircraft at our everett modification center. we also remain focused on stabilizing 787 production rates at 10 per month while continuing to improve aircraft reliability and satisfy customer mission and performance requirements. we continue to monitor and address challenges associated with aircraft production and assembly, including management of our manufacturing operations and extended global supply chain, completion and integration of traveled work, as well as the incorporation of the 787-9 derivative into the manufacturing process. in addition, we continue to work with our customers and suppliers to assess the specific impacts of schedule changes, including requests for contractual relief related to delivery delays and supplier assertions.during 2009, we concluded that the first three flight-test 787 aircraft could not be sold as previously anticipated due to the inordinate amount of rework and unique and extensive modifications made to those aircraft. as a result, costs associated with these airplanes were included in research and development expense. we have finalized orders for two of the three remaining flight test aircraft. we continue to believe that the remaining 787 flight-test aircraft is commercially saleable and we continue to include costs related to that airplane in program inventory. if we determine that the remaining aircraft cannot be sold, we may incur additional charges related to the reclassification of costs associated with this aircraft to research and development expense.during the third quarter of 2013 we increased the accounting quantity to 1,300 units from 1,100 units to reflect incorporation of revenue and cost estimates associated with the 787-10 and plans to increase production rates to 12 and 14 per month in future years. the accounting quantity of 1,300 units continues to represent approximately 10 years of production at planned production rates. the combination of production challenges, change incorporation, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts has created significant pressure on program profitability. if risks related to this program, including risks associated with planned production rate increases, or introducing the 787-9 and 787-10 derivatives as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, as well as further pressures on program profitability and/or a reach-forward loss. we continue to implement mitigation plans and cost-reduction efforts to improve program profitability and address program risks.fleet support we provide the operators of our commercial airplanes with assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe airplane operation. collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services begin prior to airplane delivery and continue throughout the operational life of the airplane. they include flight and maintenance training, field service support costs, engineering services, information services and systems and technical data and documents. the costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred and have been historically less than 1.5% of total consolidated costs of products and services.28table of contentsprogram development the following chart summarizes the time horizon between go-ahead and planned initial delivery for major commercial airplanes derivatives and programs.we launched the 787-10 in june 2013 and the 777x in november 2013.additional considerationsthe development and ongoing production of commercial aircraft is extremely complex, involving extensive coordination and integration with suppliers and highly-skilled labor from thousands of employees and other partners. meeting or exceeding our performance and reliability standards, as well as those of customers and regulators, can be costly and technologically challenging. in addition, the introduction of new aircraft and derivatives, such as the 787-9, 787-10, 737 max and 777x, involves increased risks associated with meeting development, production and certification schedules. as a result, our ability to deliver aircraft on time, satisfy performance and reliability standards and achieve or maintain, as applicable, program profitability is subject to significant risks. factors that could result in lower margins (or a material charge if an airplane program has or is determined to have reach-forward losses) include the following: changes to the program accounting quantity, customer and model mix, production costs and rates, changes to price escalation factors in aircraft purchase contracts, performance or reliability issues involving completed aircraft, capital expenditures and other costs associated with increasing or adding new production capacity, learning curve, additional change incorporation, anticipated cost reductions, flight test and certification schedules, costs, schedule and demand for derivative airplanes and status of customer claims, supplier assertions and other contractual negotiations. while we believe the cost and revenue estimates incorporated in the consolidated financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of our airplane programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure.29table of contentsdefense, space& securitybusiness environment and trends united states government defense environment overview u.s. government appropriation levels remain subject to significant uncertainty. in august 2011, the budget control act (the act) established limits on u.s. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 u.s. government fiscal years. the act also provided that the defense budget would face sequestration cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. the impact of sequestration cuts was reduced with respect to fy2014 and fy2015 following the enactment of the bipartisan budget act in december 2013. however, significant uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that u.s. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure, including risk of future sequestration cuts.in addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the u.s. department of defense (u.s. dod) and other government agencies (including the national aeronautics and space administration) within the overall budgetary framework described above. while the fy2014 appropriations finalized in january 2014 included funding for boeings major programs, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in fy2015 and beyond will affect boeings programs. future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. in addition to the risks described above, if congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which could have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts or sequestration impacts. for example, requirements to furlough employees in the u.s. dod or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders.  international environment overview the international market continues to be driven by complex and evolving security challenges and the need to modernize aging equipment and inventories, while faced with constrained budgets. in europe, the continuing financial challenges are forcing governments to institute austerity measures negatively impacting defense spending in the near term.the strongest opportunities for bds in 2014 will be the middle east and asia pacific regions where the relative financial strength of these economies, coupled with a broad spectrum of evolving threats, will result in procurement of defense and security systems.30table of contentsbds realignmenteffective january1, 2013,

we are on contract to perform for which funding has not yet been authorized and appropriated. bds total backlog was $67,288 million at december 31, 2013, reflecting a decrease of 6% from december 31, 2012. bds total backlog increased by 19% in 2012, from $60,041 million to $71,475 million. for further details on the changes between periods, refer to the discussions of the individual segments below. additional considerationsour bds business includes a variety of development programs which have complex design and technical challenges. many of these programs have cost-type contracting arrangements. in these cases, the associated financial risks are primarily in reduced fees, lower profit rates or program cancellation if cost, schedule or technical performance issues arise. examples of these programs include ground-based midcourse defense (gmd), proprietary and space launch systems programs.some of our development programs are contracted on a fixed-price basis. many of these programs have highly complex designs. as technical or quality issues arise during development, we may experience schedule delays and cost impacts, which could increase our estimated cost to perform the work or reduce our estimated price, either of which could result in a material charge or otherwise adversely affect our financial condition. these programs are ongoing, and while we believe the cost and fee estimates incorporated in the financial statements are appropriate, the technical complexity of these programs creates financial risk as additional completion costs may become necessary or scheduled delivery dates could be extended, which could trigger termination provisions, the loss of satellite in-orbit incentive payments, or other financially significant exposure. these programs have risk for reach-forward losses if our estimated costs exceed our estimated contract revenues. examples of significant fixed-price development programs include airborne early warningand control (aew&c), india p-8i, saudi arabia f-15, usaf kc-46a tanker, and commercial and military satellites.boeing military aircraft operating results(dollars in millions)years ended

fewer deliveries of aew&c aircraft, and customer and delivery mix for the f-18 and c-17 programs. this reduction was partially offset by an increase of $1,168 million related to higher 2013 deliveries of p-8 aircraft and apache rotorcraft, as well as non-recurring effort on several chinook programs. bma revenues in 2012 increased by $1,434 million or 10% compared with 2011 primarily due to higher deliveries on the p-8a and apache programs of $1,050 million and higher milestone revenue of $426 32table of contentsmillion on the kc-46a tanker program. in addition, f-15 program revenues were $450 million higher reflecting initial revenues on the contract for the kingdom of saudi arabia partially offset by lower f-15 deliveries. these increases were partially offset by decreases of $723 million related to fewer deliveries of c-17 aircraft in 2012 and the conclusion of the kc-767 international tanker program in 2011.deliveries of units for new-build production aircraft, excluding

due to lower earnings on the aew&c and higher 2012 earnings related to the initial revenues on the saudi f-15 program. the lower earnings were partially offset by higher earnings on the p-8 and apache program due to increased deliveries and higher revenues. net favorable cumulative contract catch-up adjustments were $146 million lower in 2013 than in 2012, primarily driven by less favorable adjustments to the f-15 program and unfavorable adjustments to the aew&c program. in the third quarter of 2013, we decided to end production of c-17 aircraft in 2015. see note 11. also in the third quarter of 2013, we recorded a charge of $64 million to write off inventory and accrue termination liabilities as a result of the republic of korea's announcement that it will restart its f-x fighter aircraft competition.bma earnings from operations in 2012 increased by $58 million compared with 2011 primarily due to higher aircraft deliveries on the p-8a and apache programs and reach-forward loss provisions in 2011 on the kc-767 international tanker program. these increases were partially offset by fewer aircraft deliveries on the c-17 program and higher research and development costs. the increase in earnings includes net favorable cumulative catch-up contract adjustments which were $139 million higher in 2012 compared with 2011 primarily reflecting favorable adjustments on the f-15 and chinook programs.backlogbma total backlog was $35,424 million at december31, 2013, reflecting a decrease of 8% from december 31, 2012 primarily due to revenues recognized on f-15, f-18 and c-17 program contracts awarded in prior years, partially offset by ch-47 chinook and v-22 osprey multi-year contract awards. bma total backlog in 2012 increased by 25% from 2011, primarily due to f-15 and

2013 bcc suspended its separate u.s. securities and exchange commission reporting obligations. this change does not affect operations or customer interactions. on january 23, 2013, boeing issued full and unconditional guarantees of all of the outstanding publicly-issued debt securities of bcc. funding requirements will be provided to bcc through intercompany loans from boeing and we will continue to target a bcc debt-to-equity ratio of 5.0-to-1. as described in note 13, on may 3, 2013, boeing issued $500 million of notes and entered into a concurrent intercompany loan with bcc on the same terms. interest expense associated with these notes is included in boeing capital interest expense. effective january 1, 2013, bcc's accounting for certain leasing transactions was aligned with boeing. segment information previously reported has been adjusted to reflect this change.business environment and trendsbccs gross customer financing and investment portfolio at december31, 2013 totaled $3,921 million. a substantial portion of bccs portfolio is concentrated among certain u.s. commercial airline customers. bccs portfolio is also concentrated by varying degrees across boeing aircraft product types, most notably out-of-production boeing aircraft such as 717 aircraft.bcc provided customer financing of $220 million and $364 million during 2013 and 2012. while we may be required to fund a number of new aircraft deliveries in 2014, we expect alternative financing will be available at reasonable prices from broad and globally diverse sources.aircraft values and lease rates are impacted by the number and type of aircraft that are currently out of service. approximately 2,100 western-built commercial jet aircraft (9.2% of current world fleet) were parked at the end of 2013, including both in-production and out-of-production aircraft types. of these parked aircraft, approximately 20% are not expected to return to service. at the end of 2012 and 2011, 10% and 9.4% of the western-built commercial jet aircraft were parked. aircraft valuations could decline if significant numbers of additional aircraft, particularly types with relatively few operators, are placed out of service.operating results(dollars in millions)years ended december31,201320122011revenues$408$468$547earnings from operations$107$88$119operating margins26%19%22%revenuesbcc segment revenues

$5.7 billion in 2013, $6.2 billion in 2012 and $9.8 billion in 2011, driven by continued investment in commercial airplane program inventory, primarily 787 inventory. advances and progress billings increased by $3.9 billion in 2013, $1.9 billion in 2012 and $5 billion in 2011, primarily due to payments from commercial airplane customers. discretionary contributions to our pension plans totaled $1.5 billion in 2013 compared with $1.6 billion in 2012 and $0.5 billion in 2011. investing activities cash used by investing activities totaled $5.2 billion during 2013 compared with $3.8 billion used during 2012 and $2.4 billion provided during 2011, largely due to higher net contributions to investments in time deposits. net contributions to investments were $2.9 billion in 2013 compared with $2 billion in 2012 and net proceeds from investments of $4 billion in 2011. in 2013, capital expenditures totaled $2.1 billion, up from $1.7 billion in the prior two years. we expect capital expenditures to remain higher in 2014 due to continued investment to support growth.financing activities cash used by financing activities was $4.2 billion during 2013, an increase of $0.8 billion compared with 2012 primarily due to share repurchases of $2.8 billion in 2013 partially offset by higher new borrowings of $0.5 billion, lower debt repayments of $0.6 billion and an increase in stock options exercised of $1 billion in the current year. cash used by financing activities was $3.5 billion during 2012, an increase of $1.8 billion compared with 2011 as a result of higher debt repayments of $1.1 billion and lower new borrowings of $0.7 billion.in 2013, we issued notes totaling $0.5 billion to fund the bcc segment and repaid $1.4 billion of debt, including repayments of $0.6 billion of debt held at bcc. at december 31, 2013 and 2012, the recorded balance of debt was $9.6 billion and $10.4 billion, of which $1.6 billion and $1.4 billion were classified as short-term. this includes $2.6 billion and $2.7 billion of debt attributable to bcc, of which $0.7 billion was classified as short-term in both periods.during 2013, we repurchased 25.4 million shares totaling $2.8 billion through our open market share repurchase program. there were no shares repurchased through the share repurchase program in 2012 and 2011. in 2013 and 2012, we had 0.8 million and 1 million shares transferred to us from employees for tax withholdings. capital resources we have substantial borrowing capacity. any future borrowings may affect our credit ratings and are subject to various debt covenants as described below. we have a commercial paper program that continues to serve as a significant potential source of short-term liquidity. throughout 2013 and at december31, 2013, we had no commercial paper borrowings outstanding. currently, we have $4.8 billion of unused borrowing capacity on revolving credit line agreements. we anticipate that these credit lines will primarily serve as backup liquidity to support our general corporate borrowing needs.financing commitments totaled $18 billion and $18.1 billion at december 31, 2013 and 2012. we anticipate that we will not be required to fund a significant portion of our financing commitments as we continue to work with third party financiers to provide alternative financing to customers. historically, we have not been required to fund significant amounts of outstanding commitments. however, there can be no assurances that we will not be required to fund greater amounts than historically required.in the event we require additional funding to support strategic business opportunities, our commercial aircraft financing commitments, unfavorable resolution of litigation or other loss contingencies, or other business requirements, we expect to meet increased funding requirements by issuing commercial paper or term debt. we believe our ability to access external capital resources should be sufficient to satisfy existing short-term and long-term commitments and plans, and also to provide adequate financial flexibility to take advantage of potential strategic business opportunities should they arise within the next year. however, there can be no assurance of the cost or availability of future borrowings, if any, under our commercial paper program, in the debt markets or our credit facilities.39table of contentsat december 31, 2013 and 2012, our pension plans were $10.5 billion and $19.7 billion underfunded as measured under gaap. on an employee retirement income security act (erisa) basis our plans are more than 100% funded at december31, 2013 with minimal required contributions in 2014. we expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately $750 million in 2014. we may be required to make higher contributions to our pension plans in future years.at december31, 2013, we were in compliance with the covenants for our debt and credit facilities. the most restrictive covenants include a limitation on mortgage debt and sale and leaseback transactions as a percentage of consolidated net tangible assets (as defined in the credit agreements), and a limitation on consolidated debt as a percentage of total capital (as defined). when considering debt covenants, we continue to have substantial borrowing capacity.contractual obligationsthe

specify a fixed, minimum, variable, or indexed price provision; and specify approximate timing of the transaction. purchase obligations include amounts recorded as well as amounts that are not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position. approximately 4% of the purchase obligations disclosed above are reimbursable to us pursuant to cost-type government contracts.40table of contentspurchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position production related purchase obligations not recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position include agreements for inventory procurement, tooling costs, electricity and natural gas contracts, property, plant and equipment, and other miscellaneous production related obligations. the most significant obligation relates to inventory procurement contracts. we have entered into certain significant inventory procurement contracts that specify determinable prices and quantities, and long-term delivery timeframes. in addition, we purchase raw materials on behalf of our suppliers. these agreements require suppliers and vendors to be prepared to build and deliver items in sufficient time to meet our production schedules. the need for such arrangements with suppliers and vendors arises from the extended production planning horizon for many of our products. a significant portion of these inventory commitments is supported by firm contracts and/or has historically resulted in settlement through reimbursement from customers for penalty payments to the supplier should the customer not take delivery. these amounts are also included in our forecasts of costs for program and contract accounting. some inventory procurement contracts may include escalation adjustments. in these limited cases, we have included our best estimate of the effect of the escalation adjustment in the amounts disclosed in the table above.purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position purchase obligations recorded on the consolidated statements of financial position primarily include accounts payable and certain other current and long-term liabilities including accrued compensation.industrial participation agreements we have entered into various industrial participation agreements with certain customers outside of the u.s. to facilitate economic flow back and/or technology transfer to their businesses or government agencies as the result of their procurement of goods and/or services from us. these commitments may be satisfied by our placement of direct work or vendor orders for supplies, opportunities to bid on supply contracts, transfer of technology or other forms of assistance. however, in certain cases, our commitments may be satisfied through other parties (such as our vendors) who purchase supplies from our non-u.s. customers. we do not commit to industrial participation agreements unless a contract for sale of our products or services is signed. in certain cases, penalties could be imposed if we do not meet our industrial participation commitments. during 2013, we incurred no such penalties. as of december31, 2013, we have outstanding industrial participation agreements totaling $18.4 billion that extend through 2030. purchase order commitments associated with industrial participation agreements are included in purchase obligations in the table above. to be eligible for such a purchase order commitment from us, a foreign supplier must have sufficient capability to meet our requirements and must be competitive in cost, quality and schedule.income tax obligations as of december31, 2013, our net asset for income taxes receivable, including uncertain tax positions, was $24 million. we are not able to reasonably estimate the timing of future cash flows related to uncertain tax positions. our income tax matters are excluded from the table above. see note 4 to our consolidated financial statements.41table of

discussion of these arrangements, see note 12 to our consolidated financial statements.42table of contentsnon-gaap measurescore operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per shareour consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states (gaap) which we supplement with certain non-gaap financial information. these non-gaap measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the related gaap measures, and other companies may define such measures differently. we encourage investors to review our financial statements and publicly-filed reports in their entirety and not to rely on any single financial measure. core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share exclude the impact of unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit expenses which represent costs not attributable to business segments - see note 21 to our consolidated financial statements.management uses core operating earnings, core operating margin and core earnings per share for purposes of evaluating and forecasting underlying business performance.management believes these core earnings measures provide investors additional insights into operational performance as unallocated pension and other postretirement benefit cost primarily represent costs driven by market factors and costs not allocable to u.s. government contracts.reconciliation of gaap measures to non-gaap measuresthe table below reconciles the non-gaap financial measures of core operating earnings,

accounting to determine revenue, cost of sales, and profit for almost all of our bds business. contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating the total sales and costs for each contract, which results in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. for each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. due to the size, duration and nature of many of our contracts, the estimation of total sales and costs through completion is complicated and subject to many variables. total contract sales estimates are based on negotiated contract prices and quantities, modified by our assumptions regarding contract options, change orders, incentive and award provisions associated with technical performance, and price adjustment clauses (such as inflation or index-based clauses). the majority of these contracts are with the u.s. government where the price is generally based on estimated cost to produce the product or service plus profit. federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. total contract cost estimates are largely based on negotiated or estimated purchase contract terms, historical performance trends, business base and other economic projections. factors that influence these estimates include inflationary trends, technical and schedule risk, internal and subcontractor performance trends, business volume assumptions, asset utilization, and anticipated labor agreements.revenue and cost estimates for all significant contracts are reviewed and reassessed quarterly. changes in these estimates could result in recognition of cumulative catch-up adjustments to the contracts inception to date revenues, cost of sales and profit, in the period in which such changes are made. changes in revenue and cost estimates could also result in a reach-forward loss or an adjustment to a reach-forward loss, which would be recorded immediately in earnings. for the years ending december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 net cumulative catch-up adjustments, including reach-forward losses, across all bds contracts increased operating earnings by $242 million, $379 million and $229 million, respectively.due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions or if the underlying circumstances were to change. changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. if the combined gross margin for all contracts in bds for all of 2013 had been estimated to be higher or lower by 1%, it would have increased or decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $332 million. in addition, a number of our fixed price development contracts are in a reach-forward loss position. changes to estimated losses are recorded immediately in earnings.program accountingprogram accounting requires the demonstrated ability to reliably estimate the relationship of sales to costs for the defined program accounting quantity. a program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. for each program, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer.factors that must be estimated include program accounting quantity, sales price, labor and employee benefit costs, material costs, procured part costs, major component costs, overhead costs, program tooling 44table of contentsand other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs. estimation of the accounting quantity for each program takes into account several factors that are indicative of the demand for the particular program, such as firm orders, letters of intent from prospective customers, and market studies. total estimated program sales are determined by estimating the model mix and sales price for all unsold units within the accounting quantity, added together with the sales prices for all undelivered units under contract. the sales prices for all undelivered units within the accounting quantity include an escalation adjustment for inflation that is updated quarterly. cost estimates are based largely on negotiated and anticipated contracts with suppliers, historical performance trends, and business base and other economic projections. factors that influence these estimates include production rates, internal and subcontractor performance trends, customer and/or supplier claims or assertions, asset utilization, anticipated labor agreements, and inflationary trends.to ensure reliability in our estimates, we employ a rigorous estimating process that is reviewed and updated on a quarterly basis. changes in estimates are normally recognized on a prospective basis; when estimated costs to complete a program exceed estimated revenues from undelivered units in the accounting quantity, a loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.the program method of accounting allocates tooling and other non-recurring and production costs over the accounting quantity for each program. because of the higher unit production costs experienced at the beginning of a new program and substantial investment required for initial tooling and other non-recurring costs, new commercial aircraft programs, such as the 787 program, typically have lower margins than established programs.due to the significance of judgment in the estimation process described above, it is likely that materially different cost of sales amounts could be recorded if we used different assumptions, or if the underlying circumstances were to change. changes in underlying assumptions/estimates, supplier performance, or other circumstances may adversely or positively affect financial performance in future periods. if combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of 2013 had been estimated to be lower by 1%, it would have increased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $460 million. if the combined cost of sales percentages for commercial airplane programs for all of 2013 (excluding the 747 and 787 programs which had gross margins that were breakeven or near breakeven during 2013) had been estimated to be higher by 1%, it would have decreased pre-tax income for the year by approximately $354 million. if we are unable to mitigate risks associated with the 747 and 787 programs, or if we are required to change one or more of our pricing, cost or other assumptions related to these programs, we could be required to record reach forward losses which could have a material effect on our reported results.goodwill and indefinite-lived intangible impairmentswe test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment, we evaluate economic, industry and company-specific factors as an initial step in assessing the fair value of operations. if we determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. for operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. if the fair value is determined to be less than book value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. in this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.we estimate the fair values of the related operations using discounted cash flows. forecasts of future cash flows are based on our best estimate of future sales and operating costs, based primarily on existing firm orders, expected future orders, contracts with suppliers, labor agreements and general market conditions. changes in these forecasts could significantly change the amount of impairment recorded, if any.45table of contentsthe cash flow forecasts are adjusted by an appropriate discount rate derived from our market capitalization plus a suitable control premium at the date of evaluation. therefore, changes in the stock price may also affect the amount of impairment recorded, if any.we completed our assessment of goodwill as of april1, 2013 and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill. as of december 31, 2013, we estimated that the fair value of each reporting unit significantly exceeded its corresponding carrying value. changes in our forecasts, or decreases in the value of our common stock could cause book values of certain operations to exceed their fair values which may result in goodwill impairment charges in future periods. as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, we had $497 million of indefinite-lived intangible assets related to the jeppesen and aviall brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. we test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment. a 10% decrease in the discounted cash flows would reduce the carrying value of these indefinite-lived intangible assets by less than $1 million.pension plansthe majority of our employees are earning benefits under defined benefit pension plans. all nonunion and some union employees hired after december31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. accounting rules require an annual measurement of our projected obligation and plan assets. these measurements are based upon several assumptions, including the discount rate and the expected long-term rate of asset return. future changes in assumptions or differences between actual and expected outcomes can significantly affect our future annual expense, projected benefit obligation and shareholders equity.the following table shows the sensitivity of our pension plan liability and net periodic cost to a 25 basis point change in the discount rate as of december31, 2013.(dollars in millions)changeindiscountrateincrease25bpschangeindiscountratedecrease25bpspension plansprojected benefit obligation($2,043)$2,543net periodic pension cost(227)279pension expense is also sensitive to changes in the expected long-term rate of asset return. a decrease or increase of 25 basis points in the expected long-term rate of asset return would have increased or decreased 2013 net periodic pension expense by $131 million. we expect 2014 net periodic pension cost to decrease by approximately $1,400 million and the portion recognized in earnings for 2014 to increase by approximately $100 million primarily due to amortization of actuarial losses.46table of contentsitem7a. quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market riskinterest rate riskwe have financial instruments that are subject to interest rate risk, principally fixed-rate debt obligations, and customer financing assets and liabilities. additionally, bcc uses interest rate swaps with certain debt obligations to manage exposure to interest rate changes. historically, we have not experienced material gains or losses on our customer financing assets and liabilities due to interest rate changes. as of december31, 2013, the impact over the next 12 months of a 100 basis point rise in interest rates to our pre-tax earnings would not be significant. the investors in our fixed-rate debt obligations do not generally have the right to demand we pay off these obligations prior to maturity. therefore, exposure to interest rate risk is not believed to be material for our fixed-rate debt.foreign currency exchange rate riskwe are subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk relating to receipts from customers and payments to suppliers in foreign currencies. we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to hedge the price risk associated with firmly committed and forecasted foreign denominated payments and receipts related to our ongoing business. foreign currency forward and option contracts are sensitive to changes in foreign currency exchange rates. at december31, 2013, a 10% increase in the exchange rate in our portfolio of foreign currency contracts would have decreased our unrealized gains by $244 million and a 10% decrease in the exchange rate would have increased our unrealized gains by $244 million. consistent with the use of these contracts to neutralize the effect of exchange rate fluctuations, such unrealized losses or gains would be offset by corresponding gains or losses, respectively, in the remeasurement of the underlying transactions being hedged. when taken together, these forward currency contracts and the offsetting underlying commitments do not create material market risk.47table of contentsitem8. financial statements and supplementary dataindex to the consolidated financial statementspageconsolidated statements of operations49consolidated

accounting policiesprinciples of consolidation and basis of presentationthe consolidated financial statements included in this report have been prepared by management of the boeing company (herein referred to as boeing, the company, we, us, or our). these statements include the accounts of all majority-owned subsidiaries and variable interest entities that are required to be consolidated. all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. amounts reported in prior periods as interest and debt expense have been reclassified to boeing capital interest expense to conform to the current year presentation. use of estimatesmanagement makes assumptions and estimates to prepare financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america. those assumptions and estimates directly affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements. significant estimates for which changes in the near term are considered reasonably possible and that may have a material impact on the financial statements are disclosed in these notes to the consolidated financial statements.operating cyclefor classification of certain current assets and liabilities, we use the duration of the related contract or program as our operating cycle, which is generally longer than one year.revenue and related cost recognitioncontract accounting contract accounting is used for development and production activities predominantly by defense, space& security (bds). the majority of business conducted by bds is performed under contracts with the u.s. government and other customers that extend over several years. contract accounting involves a judgmental process of estimating total sales and costs for each contract resulting in the development of estimated cost of sales percentages. for each contract, the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage to the amount of revenue recognized. when the current estimates of total sales and costs for a contract indicate a loss, a provision for the entire loss on the contract is recognized.changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effect on operating income are recognized using a cumulative catch-up adjustment which recognizes in the current period the cumulative effect of the changes on current and prior periods based on a contracts percent complete. in 2013, 2012 and 2011 net favorable cumulative catch-up adjustments increased earnings from operations by $242, $379 and $229, respectively and diluted eps by $0.23, $0.33 and $0.23, respectively.we combine contracts for accounting purposes when they are negotiated as a package with an overall profit margin objective. these essentially represent an agreement to do a single project for a single customer, involve interrelated construction activities with substantial common costs, and are performed concurrently or sequentially. when a group of contracts is combined, revenue and profit are earned uniformly over the performance of the combined contracts. similarly, we may segment a single contract 55table of contentsor group of contracts when a clear economic decision has been made during contract negotiations that would produce different rates of profitability for each element or phase of the contract.sales related to fixed-price contracts are recognized as deliveries are made, except for certain fixed-price contracts that require substantial performance over an extended period before deliveries begin, for which sales are recorded based on the attainment of performance milestones. sales related to contracts in which we are reimbursed for costs incurred plus an agreed upon profit are recorded as costs are incurred. the federal acquisition regulations provide guidance on the types of cost that will be reimbursed in establishing contract price. contracts may contain provisions to earn incentive and award fees if specified targets are achieved. incentive and award fees that can be reasonably estimated and are probable are recorded over the performance period of the contract. incentive and award fees that cannot be reasonably estimated are recorded when awarded.program accounting our commercial airplanes segment predominantly uses program accounting to account for cost of sales related to its programs. program accounting is applicable to products manufactured for delivery under production-type contracts where profitability is realized over multiple contracts and years. under program accounting, inventoriable production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and warranty costs are accumulated and charged to cost of sales by program instead of by individual units or contracts. a program consists of the estimated number of units (accounting quantity) of a product to be produced in a continuing, long-term production effort for delivery under existing and anticipated contracts. the determination of the accounting quantity is limited by the ability to make reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and cost of existing and anticipated contracts. to establish the relationship of sales to cost of sales, program accounting requires estimates of (a)the number of units to be produced and sold in a program, (b)the period over which the units can reasonably be expected to be produced, and (c)the units expected sales prices, production costs, program tooling and other non-recurring costs, and routine warranty costs for the total program.we recognize sales for commercial airplane deliveries as each unit is completed and accepted by the customer. sales recognized represent the price negotiated with the customer, adjusted by an escalation formula as specified in the customer agreement. the amount reported as cost of sales is determined by applying the estimated cost of sales percentage for the total remaining program to the amount of sales recognized for airplanes delivered and accepted by the customer. changes in estimated revenues, cost of sales and the related effects on program margins are recognized prospectively except in cases where the program is determined to have a reach-forward loss in which case the loss is recognized in the current period. see note 11.concession sharing arrangements we account for sales concessions to our customers in consideration of their purchase of products and services as a reduction to revenue when the related products and services are delivered. the sales concessions incurred may be partially reimbursed by certain suppliers in accordance with concession sharing arrangements. we record these reimbursements, which are presumed to represent reductions in the price of the vendors products or services, as a reduction in cost of products.spare parts revenue we recognize sales of spare parts upon delivery and the amount reported as cost of sales is recorded at average cost.service revenue service revenue is recognized when the service is performed with the exception of u.s. government service agreements, which are accounted for using contract accounting. service activities primarily include: support agreements associated with military aircraft and helicopter contracts, ongoing maintenance of international space station, and technical and flight operation services for commercial aircraft. service revenue and associated cost of sales from pay-in-advance subscription fees are deferred and recognized as services are rendered.56table of contentsfinancial services revenue we record financial services revenue associated with sales-type/finance leases, operating leases, and notes receivable.lease and financing revenue arrangements are included in sales of services on the consolidated statements of operations. for sales-type/finance leases, we record an asset at lease inception. this asset is recorded at the aggregate future minimum lease payments, estimated residual value of the leased equipment, and deferred incremental direct costs less unearned income. income is recognized over the life of the lease to approximate a level rate of return on the net investment. residual values, which are reviewed periodically, represent the estimated amount we expect to receive at lease termination from the disposition of the leased equipment. actual residual values realized could differ from these estimates. declines in estimated residual value that are deemed other-than-temporary are recognized in the period in which the declines occur.for operating leases, revenue on leased aircraft and equipment is recorded on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. operating lease assets, included in customer financing, are recorded at cost and depreciated over the period that we project we will hold the asset to an estimated residual value, using the straight-line method. we periodically review our estimates of residual value and recognize forecasted changes by prospectively adjusting depreciation expense.for notes receivable, notes are recorded net of any unamortized discounts and deferred incremental direct costs. interest income and amortization of any discounts are recorded ratably over the related term of the note.reinsurance revenue our wholly-owned insurance subsidiary, astro ltd., participates in a reinsurance pool for workers compensation. the member agreements and practices of the reinsurance pool minimize any participating members individual risk. reinsurance revenues were $160, $129 and $144 during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. reinsurance costs related to premiums and claims paid to the reinsurance pool were $147, $128 and $142 during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. revenues and costs are presented net in cost of services in the consolidated statements of operations.fleet supportwe provide assistance and services to facilitate efficient and safe aircraft operation to the operators of all our commercial airplane models. collectively known as fleet support services, these activities and services include flight and maintenance training, field service support, engineering services, and technical data and documents. fleet support activity begins prior to aircraft delivery as the customer receives training, manuals, and technical consulting support. this activity continues throughout the aircrafts operational life. services provided after delivery include field service support, consulting on maintenance, repair, and operational issues brought forth by the customer or regulators, updating manuals and engineering data, and the issuance of service bulletins that impact the entire models fleet. field service support involves our personnel located at customer facilities providing and coordinating fleet support activities and requests. the costs for fleet support are expensed as incurred as cost of services.research and developmentresearch and development includes costs incurred for experimentation, design, and testing, as well as bid and proposal efforts related to government products and services which are expensed as incurred unless the costs are related to certain contractual arrangements with customers. costs that are incurred pursuant to such contractual arrangements are recorded over the period that revenue is recognized, consistent with our contract accounting policy. we have certain research and development arrangements that meet the requirement for best efforts research and development accounting. accordingly, the amounts funded by the customer are recognized as an offset to our research and development expense rather than 57table of contentsas contract revenues. research and development expense included bid and proposal costs of $285, $326 and $332 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.we have established cost sharing arrangements with some suppliers for the 787 program. our cost sharing arrangements state that the supplier contributions are for reimbursements of costs we incur for experimentation, basic design, and testing activities during the 787 development. in each arrangement, we retain substantial rights to the 787 part or component covered by the arrangement. the amounts received from these cost sharing arrangements are recorded as a reduction to research and development expenses since we have no obligation to refund any amounts received per the arrangements regardless of the outcome of the development efforts. specifically, under the terms of each agreement, payments received from suppliers for their share of the costs are typically based on milestones and are recognized as earned when we achieve the milestone events and no ongoing obligation on our part exists. in the event we receive a milestone payment prior to the completion of the milestone, the amount is classified in accrued liabilities until earned.share-based compensationwe provide various forms of share-based compensation to our employees. for awards settled in shares, we measure compensation expense based on the grant-date fair value net of estimated forfeitures. for awards settled in cash, or that may be settled in cash, we measure compensation expense based on the fair value at each reporting date net of estimated forfeitures. the expense is recognized over the requisite service period, which is generally the vesting period of the award.income taxesprovisions for federal, state, and non-u.s. income taxes are calculated on reported earnings before income taxes based on current tax law and also include, in the current period, the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities. such provisions differ from the amounts currently receivable or payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes. significant judgment is required in determining income tax provisions and evaluating tax positions.the accounting for uncertainty in income taxes requires a more-likely-than-not threshold for financial statement recognition and measurement of tax positions taken or expected to be taken in a tax return. we record a liability for the difference between the benefit recognized and measured for financial statement purposes and the tax position taken or expected to be taken on our tax return. to the extent that our assessment of such tax positions changes, the change in estimate is recorded in the period in which the determination is made. tax-related interest and penalties are classified as a component of income tax expense.postretirement plansthe majority of our employees are earning benefits under defined benefit pension plans. all nonunion and some union employees hired after december31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. we also provide postretirement benefit plans other than pensions, consisting principally of health care coverage to eligible retirees and qualifying dependents. benefits under the pension and other postretirement benefit plans are generally based on age at retirement and years of service and, for some pension plans, benefits are also based on the employees annual earnings. the net periodic cost of our pension and other postretirement plans is determined using the projected unit credit method and several actuarial assumptions, the most significant of which are the discount rate, the long-term rate of asset return, and medical trend (rate of growth for medical costs). a portion of net periodic pension and other postretirement income or expense is not recognized in net earnings in the year incurred because it is allocated to production 58table of contentsas product costs, and reflected in inventory at the end of a reporting period. actuarial gains and losses, which occur when actual experience differs from actuarial assumptions, are reflected in shareholders equity (net of taxes). if actuarial gains and losses exceed ten percent of the greater of plan assets or plan liabilities we amortize them over the average future service period of employees. the funded status of our pension and postretirement plans is reflected on the consolidated statements of financial position.postemployment planswe record a liability for postemployment benefits, such as severance or job training, when payment is probable, the amount is reasonably estimable, and the obligation relates to rights that have vested or accumulated.environmental remediationwe are subject to federal and state requirements for protection of the environment, including those for discharge of hazardous materials and remediation of contaminated sites. we routinely assess, based on in-depth studies, expert analyses and legal reviews, our contingencies, obligations, and commitments for remediation of contaminated sites, including assessments of ranges and probabilities of recoveries from other responsible parties and/or insurance carriers. our policy is to accrue and charge to current expense identified exposures related to environmental remediation sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated. the amount of the liability is based on our best estimate or the low end of a range of reasonably possible exposure for investigation, cleanup, and monitoring costs to be incurred. estimated remediation costs are not discounted to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably estimated. we may be able to recover a portion of the remediation costs from insurers or other third parties. such recoveries are recorded when realization of the claim for recovery is deemed probable.cash and cash equivalentscash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid instruments, such as commercial paper, time deposits, and other money market instruments, which have original maturities of three months or less. we aggregate our cash balances by bank where conditions for right of set-off are met, and reclassify any negative balances, consisting mainly of uncleared checks, to accounts payable. negative balances reclassified to accounts payable were $108 and $159 at december 31, 2013 and 2012.inventoriesinventoried costs on commercial aircraft programs and long-term contracts include direct engineering, production and tooling and other non-recurring costs, and applicable overhead, which includes fringe benefits, production related indirect and plant management salaries and plant services, not in excess of estimated net realizable value. to the extent a material amount of such costs are related to an abnormal event or are fixed costs not appropriately attributable to our programs or contracts, they are expensed in the current period rather than inventoried. inventoried costs include amounts relating to programs and contracts with long-term production cycles, a portion of which is not expected to be realized within one year. included in inventory for federal government contracts is an allocation of allowable costs related to manufacturing process reengineering.commercial aircraft programs inventory includes deferred production costs and supplier advances. deferred production costs represent actual costs incurred for production of early units that exceed the estimated average cost of all units in the program accounting quantity. higher production costs are experienced at the beginning of a new or derivative airplane program. units produced early in a program require substantially more effort (labor and other resources) than units produced later in a program because 59table of contentsof volume efficiencies and the effects of learning. we expect that these deferred costs will be fully recovered when all units included in the accounting quantity are delivered as the expected unit cost for later deliveries is below the estimated average cost of all units in the program. supplier advances represent payments for parts we have contracted to receive from suppliers in the future. as parts are received, supplier advances are amortized to work in process.the determination of net realizable value of long-term contract costs is based upon quarterly reviews that estimate costs to be incurred to complete all contract requirements. when actual contract costs and the estimate to complete exceed total estimated contract revenues, a loss provision is recorded. the determination of net realizable value of commercial aircraft program costs is based upon quarterly program reviews that estimate revenue and cost to be incurred to complete the program accounting quantity. when estimated costs to complete exceed estimated program revenues to go, a program loss provision is recorded in the current period for the estimated loss on all undelivered units in the accounting quantity.used aircraft purchased by the commercial airplanes segment and general stock materials are stated at cost not in excess of net realizable value. see aircraft valuation within this note for a discussion of our valuation of used aircraft. spare parts inventory is stated at lower of average unit cost or market. we review our commercial spare parts and general stock materials quarterly to identify impaired inventory, including excess or obsolete inventory, based on historical sales trends, expected production usage, and the size and age of the aircraft fleet using the part. impaired inventories are charged to cost of products in the period the impairment occurs.included in inventory for commercial aircraft programs are amounts paid or credited in cash, or other consideration to certain airline customers, that are referred to as early issue sales consideration. early issue sales consideration is recognized as a reduction to revenue when the delivery of the aircraft under contract occurs. if an airline customer does not perform and take delivery of the contracted aircraft, we believe that we would have the ability to recover amounts paid. however, to the extent early issue sales consideration exceeds advances and is not considered to be otherwise recoverable, it would be written off in the current period.we net advances and progress billings on long-term contracts against inventory in the consolidated statements of financial position. advances and progress billings in excess of related inventory are reported in advances and billings in excess of related costs.precontract costswe may, from time to time, incur costs in excess of the amounts required for existing contracts. if we determine the costs are probable of recovery from future orders, then we capitalize the precontract costs we incur, excluding start-up costs which are expensed as incurred. capitalized precontract costs are included in inventories, net of advances and progress billings, in the accompanying consolidated statements of financial position. should future orders not materialize or we determine the costs are no longer probable of recovery, the capitalized costs would be written off.property, plant and equipmentproperty, plant and equipment are recorded at cost, including applicable construction-period interest, less accumulated depreciation and are depreciated principally over the following estimated useful lives: new buildings and land improvements, from 10 to 40 years; and new machinery and equipment, from 3to 20 years. the principal methods of depreciation are as follows: buildings and land improvements, 150% declining balance; and machinery and equipment, sum-of-the-years digits. capitalized internal use software is included in other assets and amortized using the straight line method over 5 years. we periodically evaluate the appropriateness of remaining depreciable lives assigned to long-lived assets, including assets that may be subject to a management plan for disposition.60table of contentslong-lived assets held for sale are stated at the lower of cost or fair value less cost to sell. long-lived assets held for use are subject to an impairment assessment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. if the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.asset retirement obligationswe record all known asset retirement obligations for which the liabilitys fair value can be reasonably estimated, including certain asbestos removal, asset decommissioning and contractual lease restoration obligations. recorded amounts are not material.we also have known conditional asset retirement obligations, such as certain asbestos remediation and asset decommissioning activities to be performed in the future, that are not reasonably estimable due to insufficient information about the timing and method of settlement of the obligation. accordingly, these obligations have not been recorded in the consolidated financial statements. a liability for these obligations will be recorded in the period when sufficient information regarding timing and method of settlement becomes available to make a reasonable estimate of the liabilitys fair value. in addition, there may be conditional asset retirement obligations that we have not yet discovered (e.g. asbestos may exist in certain buildings but we have not become aware of it through the normal course of business), and therefore, these obligations also have not been included in the consolidated financial statements.goodwill and other acquired intangiblesgoodwill and other acquired intangible assets with indefinite lives are not amortized, but are tested for impairment annually and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is more likely than not that an impairment may exist. our annual testing date is april1.we test goodwill for impairment by performing a qualitative assessment or using a two-step impairment process. if we choose to perform a qualitative assessment and determine it is more likely than not that the carrying value of the net assets is more than the fair value of the related operations, the two-step impairment process is then performed; otherwise, no further testing is required. for operations where the two-step impairment process is used, we first compare the carrying value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations. if the fair value is determined to be less than carrying value, a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment. in this process, a fair value for goodwill is estimated, based in part on the fair value of the operations, and is compared to its carrying value. the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment.indefinite-lived intangibles consist of brand and trade names acquired in business combinations. we test these intangibles for impairment by comparing their carrying value to current projections of discounted cash flows attributable to the brand and trade names. any excess carrying value over the amount of discounted cash flows represents the amount of the impairment.our finite-lived acquired intangible assets are amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives as follows: developed technology, from 6 to 14 years; product know-how, from 5 to 30 years; customer base, from 5 to 19 years; distribution rights, from 3 to 30 years; and other, from 5 to 32 years. we evaluate the potential impairment of finite-lived acquired intangible assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. if the carrying value is no longer recoverable based upon the undiscounted future cash flows of the asset, the amount of the impairment is the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value of the asset.61table of contentsinvestmentstime deposits are held-to-maturity investments that are carried at cost.the equity method of accounting is used to account for investments for which we have the ability to exercise significant influence, but not control, over an investee. significant influence is generally deemed to exist if we have an ownership interest in the voting stock of an investee of between 20% and 50%.we classify investment income and loss on our consolidated statements of operations based on whether the investment is operating or non-operating in nature. operating investments align strategically and are integrated with our operations. earnings from operating investments, including our share of income or loss from equity method investments, dividend income from certain cost method investments, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments, are recorded in income from operating investments, net. non-operating investments are those we hold for non-strategic purposes. earnings from non-operating investments, including interest and dividends on marketable securities, and any impairments or gain/loss on the disposition of these investments are recorded in other income/(expense), net.derivativesall derivative instruments are recognized in the financial statements and measured at fair value regardless of the purpose or intent of holding them. we use derivative instruments to principally manage a variety of market risks. for derivatives designated as hedges of the exposure to changes in fair value of the recognized asset or liability or a firm commitment (referred to as fair value hedges), the gain or loss is recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributable to the risk being hedged. the effect of that accounting is to include in earnings the extent to which the hedge is not effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value. for our cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the derivatives gain or loss is initially reported in comprehensive income and is subsequently reclassified into earnings in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecasted transaction affects earnings. the ineffective portion of the gain or loss of a cash flow hedge is reported in earnings immediately. we also hold certain instruments for economic purposes that are not designated for hedge accounting treatment. for these derivative instruments, the changes in their fair value are also recorded in earnings immediately.aircraft valuationused aircraft under trade-in commitments and aircraft under repurchase commitments in conjunction with signing a definitive agreement for the sale of new aircraft (sale aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of sale aircraft. additionally, we have entered into contingent repurchase commitments with certain customers wherein we agree to repurchase the sale aircraft at a specified price, generally 10 to 15 years after delivery of the sale aircraft. our repurchase of the sale aircraft is contingent upon a future, mutually acceptable agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft. if we execute an agreement for the sale of additional new aircraft, and if the customer exercises its right to sell the sale aircraft to us, a contingent repurchase commitment would become a trade-in commitment. our historical experience is that contingent repurchase commitments infrequently become trade-in commitments.62table of contentsexposure related to trade-in commitments may take the form of:(1)adjustments to revenue for the difference between the contractual trade-in price in the definitive agreement and our best estimate of the fair value of the trade-in aircraft as of the date of such agreement, which would be recognized upon delivery of the sale aircraft, and/or(2)charges to cost of products for adverse changes in the fair value of trade-in aircraft that occur subsequent to signing of a definitive agreement for sale aircraft but prior to the purchase of the used trade-in aircraft. estimates based on current aircraft values would be included in accrued liabilities.the fair value of trade-in aircraft is determined using aircraft-specific data such as model, age and condition, market conditions for specific aircraft and similar models, and multiple valuation sources. this process uses our assessment of the market for each trade-in aircraft, which in most instances begins years before the return of the aircraft. there are several possible markets in which we continually pursue opportunities to place used aircraft. these markets include, but are not limited to, the resale market, which could potentially include the cost of long-term storage; the leasing market, with the potential for refurbishment costs to meet the leasing customers requirements; or the scrap market. trade-in aircraft valuation varies significantly depending on which market we determine is most likely for each aircraft. on a quarterly basis, we update our valuation analysis based on the actual activities associated with placing each aircraft into a market. this quarterly valuation process yields results that are typically lower than residual value estimates by independent sources and tends to more accurately reflect results upon the actual placement of the aircraft.used aircraft acquired by the commercial airplanes segment are included in inventories at the lower of cost or market as it is our intent to sell these assets. to mitigate costs and enhance marketability, aircraft may be placed on operating lease. while on operating lease, the assets are included in customer financing.customer financing customer financing includes operating lease equipment, notes receivable, and sales-type/finance leases. sales-type/finance leases are treated as receivables, and allowances for losses are established as necessary.we assess the fair value of the assets we own, including equipment under operating leases, assets held for sale or re-lease, and collateral underlying receivables, to determine if their fair values are less than the related assets carrying values. differences between carrying values and fair values of sales-type/finance leases and notes and other receivables, as determined by collateral value, are considered in determining the allowance for losses on receivables.we use a median calculated from published collateral values from multiple third-party aircraft value publications based on the type and age of the aircraft to determine the fair value of aircraft. under certain circumstances, we apply judgment based on the attributes of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by outside publications.impairment review for assets under operating leases and held for sale or re-lease we evaluate for impairment assets under operating lease or assets held for sale or re-lease when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the expected undiscounted cash flow from the asset may be less than the carrying value. we use various assumptions when determining the expected undiscounted cash flow, including our intentions for how long we will hold an asset subject to operating lease before it is sold, the expected future lease rates, lease terms, residual value of the asset, periods in which the asset may be held in preparation for a follow-on lease, maintenance costs, remarketing costs and the remaining economic life of the asset. we record assets held for sale at the lower of carrying value or fair value less costs to sell.63table of contentswhen we determine that impairment is indicated for an asset, the amount of impairment expense recorded is the excess of the carrying value over the fair value of the asset.allowance for losses on customer financing receivables we record the potential impairment of customer financing receivables in a valuation account, the balance of which is an accounting estimate of probable but unconfirmed losses. the allowance for losses on receivables relates to two components of receivables: (a)receivables that are evaluated individually for impairment and (b)all other receivables.we determine a receivable is impaired when, based on current information and events, it is probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms of the receivable agreement, without regard to any subsequent restructurings. factors considered in assessing collectibility include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. we determine a specific impairment allowance based on the difference between the carrying value of the receivable and the estimated fair value of the related collateral we would expect to realize.we review the adequacy of the allowance attributable to the remaining receivables (after excluding receivables subject to a specific impairment allowance) by assessing both the collateral exposure and the applicable cumulative default rate. collateral exposure for a particular receivable is the excess of the carrying value of the receivable over the fair value of the related collateral. a receivable with an estimated fair value in excess of the carrying value is considered to have no collateral exposure. the applicable cumulative default rate is determined using two components: customer credit ratings and weighted average remaining contract term. internally assigned credit ratings, our credit quality indicator, are determined for each customer in the portfolio. those ratings are updated based upon public information and information obtained directly from our customers.we have entered into agreements with certain customers that would entitle us to look beyond the specific collateral underlying the receivable for purposes of determining the collateral exposure as described above. should the proceeds from the sale of the underlying collateral asset resulting from a default condition be insufficient to cover the carrying value of our receivable (creating a shortfall condition), these agreements would, for example, permit us to take the actions necessary to sell or retain certain other assets in which the customer has an equity interest and use the proceeds to cover the shortfall.each quarter we review customer credit ratings, published historical credit default rates for different rating categories, and multiple third-party aircraft value publications as a basis to validate the reasonableness of the allowance for losses on receivables. there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from estimates or that the consideration of these factors in the future will not result in an increase or decrease to the allowance for losses on receivables.warrantiesin conjunction with certain product sales, we provide warranties that cover factors such as non-conformance to specifications and defects in material and design. the majority of our warranties are issued by our commercial airplanes segment. generally, aircraft sales are accompanied by a three to four-year standard warranty for systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us or manufactured to certain standards under our authorization. these warranties are included in the programs estimate at completion. on occasion we have made commitments beyond the standard warranty obligation to correct fleet-wide major issues of a particular model, resulting in additional accrued warranty expense. warranties issued by our bds segments principally relate to sales of military aircraft and weapons hardware and are included in the contract cost estimates. these sales are generally accompanied by a six to twelve-month warranty period and cover systems, accessories, equipment, parts, and software manufactured by us to certain contractual specifications. estimated costs related to standard warranties are recorded in the period in which the related product sales occur. the warranty liability recorded at each balance sheet date reflects the estimated number of months of warranty coverage outstanding for products delivered times the average 64table of contentsof historical monthly warranty payments, as well as additional amounts for certain major warranty issues that exceed a normal claims level. estimated costs of these additional warranty issues are considered changes to the initial liability estimate.we provide guarantees to certain commercial airplane customers which include compensation provisions for failure to meet specified aircraft performance targets. we account for these performance guarantees as warranties. the estimated liability for these warranties is based on known and anticipated operational characteristics and forecasted customer operation of the aircraft relative to contractually specified performance targets, and anticipated settlements when contractual remedies are not specified. estimated payments are recorded as a reduction of revenue at delivery of the related aircraft. we have agreements that require certain suppliers to compensate us for amounts paid to customers for failure of supplied equipment to meet specified performance targets. claims against suppliers under these agreements are included in inventories and recorded as a reduction in cost of products at delivery of the related aircraft. these performance warranties and claims against suppliers are included in the programs estimate at completion.supplier penaltieswe record an accrual for supplier penalties when an event occurs that makes it probable that a supplier penalty will be incurred and the amount is reasonably estimable. until an event occurs, we fully anticipate accepting all products procured under production-related contracts.guaranteeswe record a liability in accrued liabilities for the fair value of guarantees that are issued or modified after december31, 2002. for a residual value guarantee where we received a cash premium, the liability is equal to the cash premium received at the guarantees inception. for credit guarantees, the liability is equal to the present value of the expected loss. we determine the expected loss by multiplying the creditors default rate by the guarantee amount reduced by the expected recovery, if applicable, for each future period the credit guarantee will be outstanding. if at inception of a guarantee, we determine there is a probable related contingent loss, we will recognize a liability for the greater of (a)the fair value of the guarantee as described above or (b)the probable contingent loss amount.65table of contentsnote 2  goodwill and acquired intangibleschanges in the carrying amount of goodwill by reportable segment for

method that determines earnings per share for common shares and participating securities. the undistributed earnings are allocated between common shares and participating securities as if all earnings had been distributed during the period. participating securities and common shares have equal rights to undistributed earnings.basic earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the basic weighted average common shares outstanding.diluted earnings per share is calculated by taking net earnings, less earnings available to participating securities, divided by the diluted weighted average common shares outstanding.the elements used in the computation of basic and diluted earnings per share were as follows:(in millions

december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. our 2013 effective tax rate is lower than 2012 primarily due to the inclusion of the u.s. research and development tax credit (research tax credit) in 2013, which was not available in 2012, and the recognition of previously unrecognized tax benefits as a result of new regulations described below. in 2013, president obama signed into law the american taxpayer relief act of 2012 that retroactively renewed the research tax credit for 2012 and extended the credit through december 31, 2013. as tax law changes are recognized in the period in which new legislation is enacted, the 2012 research tax credit of $145 was recorded in the first quarter of 2013. our 2012 effective tax rate was higher than 2011, primarily due to tax benefits of $397 recorded in 2011 as a result of federal income tax audit settlements in addition to research tax credits which were not available in 2012. the research tax credit expired on december 31, 2013. if the research tax credit is not extended there would be an unfavorable impact to our 2014 effective income tax rate. on september 5, 2013, the internal revenue service (irs) issued proposed regulations that amend the definition of research and experimental (r&e) expenditures. the regulations provided clarity regarding the categories of expense that can be considered when computing the research tax credit. based upon our analysis of the regulations, $212 of previously unrecognized tax benefits related to research tax credits were recorded as a reduction to tax expense in the fourth quarter of 2013.68table of contentsthe following is a reconciliation of the u.s. federal statutory tax rate of 35% to our effective income tax rate:years ended december31,201320122011u.s. federal statutory

foreign withholding tax in the amount of $44 on undistributed earnings not considered indefinitely reinvested in our non-u.s. subsidiaries. we have not provided for u.s. deferred income taxes or foreign withholding tax on the remainder of undistributed earnings from our non-u.s. subsidiaries of approximately $775 because such earnings are considered to be indefinitely reinvested and it is not practicable to estimate the amount of tax that may be payable upon distribution.as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, the amounts accrued for the payment of income tax-related interest and penalties included in the consolidated statements of financial position were as follows: interest of $12 and $11 and penalties of $8 and $11. the amounts of interest benefit included in the consolidated statements of operations were $4, $43, and $94 for the years ended december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. the interest benefit recorded during 2012 was primarily related to the settlement of non-us audits. the interest benefit recorded during 2011 was primarily related to federal audit settlements. a reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefits is as follows:201320122011unrecognized tax benefits  january1$1,055$939$1,198gross increases  tax positions in prior periods1055154gross decreases  tax positions in prior periods(125)(20)(383)gross

tax rate, if recognized. as of december31, 2013, these amounts are primarily associated with u.s. federal tax issues such as the amount of research tax credits claimed, the domestic production activities deductions claimed and u.s. taxation of foreign earnings. also included in these amounts are accruals for domestic state tax issues such as the allocation of income among various state tax jurisdictions and the amount of state tax credits claimed.audit outcomes and the timing of audit settlements are subject to significant uncertainty. it is reasonably possible that within the next 12 months we will resolve the matters presently under consideration for the 2007-2010 tax years with the irs. depending on the timing and outcome of the audit settlements, unrecognized tax benefits that affect the effective tax rate could increase earnings by up to $245 based on current estimates.70table of contentsnote 5  accounts receivableaccounts receivable at december 31 consisted of the

receivables on long-term contracts arise when the sales or revenues based on performance attainment, though appropriately recognized, cannot be billed yet under terms of the contract as of the balance sheet date. any adjustment for the credit quality of unbillable receivables, if required, would be recorded as a direct reduction of revenue. factors considered in assessing the collectability of unbillable receivables include, but are not limited to, a customers extended delinquency, requests for restructuring and filings for bankruptcy. unbillable receivables related to commercial customers expected to be collected after one year were $179 and $230 at december 31, 2013 and 2012. accounts receivable related to claims are items that we believe are earned, but are subject to uncertainty concerning their determination or ultimate realization.accounts receivable as of december31, 2013, included $112 of unbillable receivables on a long-term contract with lightsquared, llc (lightsquared) related to the construction of two commercial satellites. one of the satellites has been delivered, and the other is substantially complete but remains in boeings possession. on may 14, 2012, lightsquared filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. we believe that our rights in the second satellite and related ground-segment assets are sufficient to protect the value of our receivables in the event lightsquared fails to make payments as contractually required or rejects its contract with us. given the uncertainties inherent in bankruptcy proceedings, it is reasonably possible that we could incur losses related to these receivables in connection with the lightsquared bankruptcy.accounts receivable, other than those described above, expected to be collected after one year are not

probable that we will be unable to collect amounts due according to the original contractual terms. at december 31, 2013 and 2012, we individually evaluated for impairment customer financing receivables of $95 and $616. we determined that none of these were impaired at december31, 2013 and $446 were impaired at december31, 2012. we recorded no allowance for losses on these receivables as the collateral values exceed the carrying values of the receivables.the average recorded investment in impaired financing receivables for the years ended december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, was $376, $466 and $517, respectively. income recognition is generally suspended for financing receivables at the date full recovery of income and principal becomes not probable. income is recognized when financing receivables become contractually current and performance is demonstrated by the customer. interest income recognized on such receivables was $30, $6 and $0 for the years ended december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, we had no material receivables that were greater than 30 days past due.73table of contentsthe change in the allowance for losses on

factors influencing the level of our allowance for losses on customer financing receivables are customer credit ratings, default rates and collateral values. we assign internal credit ratings for all customers and determine the creditworthiness of each customer based upon publicly available information and information obtained directly from our customers. our rating categories are comparable to those used by the major credit rating agencies. the customer financing valuation benefit recorded in 2011 was primarily driven by changes in the internal credit rating categories assigned to our receivable balances from airtran holdings, llc.our financing receivable balances at december31 by internal credit rating category are shown below:rating

(american airlines) filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. on december 9, 2013, american airlines emerged from bankruptcy. upon emergence from bankruptcy, the parent of american airlines merged with us airways group, inc., the parent of us airways, to form american airlines group inc., and american airlines assumed all of the bcc financing agreements and underlying leases.74table of contentscustomer financing exposure customer financing is collateralized by security in the related asset. the value of the collateral is closely tied to commercial airline performance and overall market conditions and may be subject to reduced valuation with market decline. declines in collateral values are also a significant driver of our allowance for losses. generally, out-of-production aircraft have experienced greater collateral value declines than in-production aircraft. our customer financing portfolio is primarily collateralized by out-of-production aircraft. the majority of customer financing carrying values are concentrated in the following aircraft models:20132012717 aircraft ($444 and $465 accounted for as operating leases)(1)$1,674$1,781757 aircraft ($402 and $454

seeking reimbursement from the other sea launch partners of the $147 bank guarantee payment and the $209 partner loan obligations. we believe the partners have the financial wherewithal to pay and intend to pursue vigorously all of our rights and remedies. in the event we are unable to secure reimbursement of $147 related to our payment under the bank guarantee and $209 related to partner loans

commitmentsin conjunction with signing definitive agreements for the sale of new aircraft (sale aircraft), we have entered into trade-in commitments with certain customers that give them the right to trade in used aircraft at a specified price upon the purchase of sale aircraft. the probability that trade-in commitments will be exercised is determined by using both quantitative information from valuation sources and qualitative information from other sources. the probability of exercise is assessed quarterly, or as events trigger a change, and takes into consideration the current economic and airline industry environments. trade-in commitments, which can be terminated by mutual consent with the customer, may be exercised only during the period specified in the agreement, and require advance notice by the customer.trade-in commitment agreements at december31, 2013 have expiration dates from 2014 through 2023. at december 31, 2013 and 2012, total contractual trade-in commitments were $1,605 and $1,535. as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, we estimated that it was probable we would be obligated to perform on certain of these commitments with net amounts payable to customers totaling $325 and $108 and the fair value of the related trade-in aircraft was $325 and $108.financing commitmentsfinancing commitments related to aircraft on order, including options and those proposed in sales campaigns, totaled $17,987 and $18,083 as of december 31, 2013 and 2012. the estimated earliest potential funding dates for these commitments as of december31, 2013 are as

investment-grade credit. we have concluded that no reserve for future potential losses is required for these financing commitments based upon the terms, such as collateralization and interest rates, under which funding would be provided.79table of contentsstandby letters of credit and surety bondswe have entered into standby letters of credit and surety bonds with financial institutions primarily relating to the guarantee of our future performance on certain contracts. contingent liabilities on outstanding letters of credit agreements and surety bonds aggregated approximately $4,376 and $4,545 as of december 31, 2013 and 2012.commitments to ulawe and lockheed martin corporation have each committed to provide ula with up to $527 of additional capital contributions in the event ula does not have sufficient funds to make a required payment to us under an inventory supply agreement. see note 6.c-17in september 2013, we decided to end production of c-17 aircraft in 2015 and recorded charges of $92, primarily for pension curtailment costs. we plan to produce 20 c-17 aircraft in 2014 and 2015 before ending production. at december31, 2013, our backlog included 6 international orders for c-17 aircraft that are scheduled for delivery through mid-2014 and we have active sales campaigns for the remaining 14 unsold aircraft. we are currently incurring costs and have made commitments to suppliers related to the unsold aircraft. we believe it is probable that we will recover costs related to the unsold aircraft from international customer orders. should orders for the 14 unsold aircraft not materialize or should we decide to discontinue production of unsold aircraft, we could incur charges to write-down inventory and/or record termination liabilities. at december31, 2013, we had approximately $430 of capitalized precontract costs and $420 of potential termination liabilities to suppliers associated with the unsold aircraft.company owned life insurancemcdonnell douglas corporation insured its executives with company owned life insurance (coli), which are life insurance policies with a cash surrender value. although we do not use coli currently, these obligations from the merger with mcdonnell douglas are still a commitment at this time. we have loans in place to cover costs paid or incurred to carry the underlying life insurance policies. as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, the cash surrender value was $451 and $423 and the total loans were $425 and $400. as we have the right to offset the loans against the cash surrender value of the policies, we present the net asset in other assets on the consolidated statements of financial position as of december 31, 2013 and 2012.united states government defense environment overviewu.s. government appropriation levels remain subject to significant uncertainty. in august 2011, the budget control act (the act) established limits on u.s. government discretionary spending, including a reduction of defense spending by approximately $490 billion between the 2012 and 2021 u.s. government fiscal years. the act also provided that the defense budget would face sequestration cuts of up to an additional $500 billion during that same period to the extent that discretionary spending limits are exceeded. the impact of sequestration cuts was reduced with respect to fy2014 and fy2015 following the enactment of the bipartisan budget act in december 2013. however, significant uncertainty remains with respect to overall levels of defense spending and it is likely that u.s. government discretionary spending levels will continue to be subject to significant pressure, including risk of future sequestration cuts.in addition, there continues to be significant uncertainty with respect to program-level appropriations for the u.s. department of defense (u.s. dod) and other government agencies (including the national aeronautics and space administration) within the overall budgetary framework described above. while 80table of contentsthe fy2014 appropriations finalized in january 2014 included funding for boeings major programs, uncertainty remains about how defense budgets in fy2015 and beyond will affect boeings programs. future budget cuts, including cuts mandated by sequestration, or future procurement decisions associated with the appropriations process could result in reductions, cancellations, and/or delays of existing contracts or programs. any of these impacts could have a material effect on the results of the companys operations, financial position and/or cash flows. in addition to the risks described above, if congress is unable to pass appropriations bills in a timely manner, a government shutdown could result which could have impacts above and beyond those resulting from budget cuts or sequestration impacts. for example, requirements to furlough employees in the u.s. dod or other government agencies could result in payment delays, impair our ability to perform work on existing contracts, and/or negatively impact future orders.bds fixed-price development contractsfixed-price development work is inherently uncertain and subject to significant variability in estimates of the cost and time required to complete the work. bds fixed-price contracts with significant development work include airborne early warning and control, india p-8i, saudi arabia f-15, usaf kc-46a tanker and commercial and military satellites. the operational and technical complexities of these contracts create financial risk, which could trigger termination provisions, order cancellations or other financially significant exposure. changes to cost and revenue estimates could also result in lower margins or a material charge for reach-forward losses in 2014.recoverable costs on government contracts our final incurred costs for each year are subject to audit and review for allowability by the u.s. government, which can result in payment demands related to costs they believe should be disallowed. we work with the u.s. government to assess the merits of claims and where appropriate reserve for amounts disputed. if we are unable to satisfactorily resolve disputed costs, we could be required to record an earnings charge and/or provide refunds to the u.s. government.747 and 787 commercial airplane programsthe development and initial production of new commercial airplanes and new commercial airplane derivatives, which include the 747 and 787, entail significant commitments to customers and suppliers as well as substantial investments in working capital, infrastructure and research and development. the 747 and 787 programs had gross margins that were breakeven or near breakeven during 2013.continued weakness in the air cargo market and lower-than-expected demand for large commercial passenger aircraft have resulted in pricing pressures and fewer 747 orders than anticipated.we continue to have a number of unsold 747 production positions. if market and production risks cannot be mitigated, the program could face a reach-forward loss that may be material.the combination of production challenges, change incorporation, schedule delays and customer and supplier impacts has created significant pressure on 787 program profitability. if risks related to this program, including risks associated with planned production rate increases, or introducing the 787-9 and 787-10 derivatives as scheduled cannot be mitigated, the program could face additional customer claims and/or supplier assertions, as well as a reach-forward loss that may be material. 81table of contentsnote 12  arrangements with off-balance sheet riskwe enter into arrangements with off-balance sheet risk in the normal course of

against potential non-recoverability and non-allowability of $1,360 of boeing delta launch program inventory included in contributed assets plus $1,860 of inventory subject to an inventory supply agreement which ends on march31, 2021. since inception, ula has consumed $1,233 of the $1,360 of inventory that was contributed by us and has yet to consume $127. ula has made advance payments of $1,380 to us and we have recorded revenues and cost of sales of $1,049 under the inventory supply agreement through december31, 2013. we agreed to indemnify ula against potential losses that ula may incur in the event ula is unable to obtain certain additional contract pricing from the u.s. air force (usaf) for four satellite missions. we believe ula is entitled to additional contract pricing. in december 2008, ula submitted a claim to the usaf to re-price the contract value for two satellite missions. in march 2009, the usaf issued a denial of that claim. in june 2009, ula filed a notice of appeal, and in october 2009, ula filed a complaint before the armed services board of contract appeals (asbca) for a contract adjustment for the price of the two satellite missions. in september 2009, the usaf exercised its option for a third satellite mission. during the third quarter of 2010, ula submitted a claim to the usaf to re-price the contract value of the third mission. the usaf did not exercise an option for a fourth mission prior to the expiration. in march 2011, ula filed a notice of appeal before the asbca, seeking to re-price the third mission. the hearing before the asbca concluded on december 20, 2013 and a post-trial briefing is expected by may 2014. if ula is unsuccessful in obtaining additional pricing, we may be responsible for a portion of the shortfall and may record up to $278 in pre-tax losses associated with the three missions, representing up to $261 for theindemnification payment and up to $17 for our portion of additional contract losses incurred by ula.82table of contentspotential payments for other delta contracts include $85 related to deferred support costs. in june 2011, the defense contract management agency (dcma) notified ula that it had determined that $271 of deferred support costs are not recoverable under government contracts. in december 2011, the dcma notified ula of the potential non-recoverability of an additional $114 of deferred production costs. the dcma has not yet issued a final decision related to the recoverability of the $114. ula and boeing believe that all costs are recoverable and in november 2011, ula filed a certified claim with the usaf for collection of deferred support and production costs. the usaf issued a final decision denying ulas certified claim in may 2012. on june 14, 2012, boeing and ula filed a suit in the court of federal claims seeking recovery of the deferred support and production costs from the u.s. government. on november 9, 2012, the u.s. government filed an answer to our claim and asserted a counterclaim for credits that it alleges were offset by deferred support cost invoices. we believe that the u.s. governments counterclaim is without merit, and have filed an answer challenging it on multiple grounds. the litigation proceeds, with no trial date having yet been set. if, contrary to our belief, it is determined that some or all of the deferred support or production costs are not recoverable, we could be required to record pre-tax losses and make indemnification payments to ula for up to $317 of the costs questioned by the dcma.other indemnifications as part of the 2004 sale agreement with general electric capital corporation related to the sale of boeing capitals (bcc) commercial financial services business, bcc is involved in a loss sharing arrangement for losses on transferred portfolio assets, such as asset sales, provisions for loss or asset impairment charges offset by gains from asset sales. at december 31, 2013 and 2012, our maximum future cash exposure to losses associated with the loss sharing arrangement was $106 and $137 and our accrued liability under the loss sharing arrangement was $28 and $32.in conjunction with our sales of electron dynamic devices, inc. and rocketdyne propulsion and power businesses and our commercial airplanes facilities in wichita, kansas and tulsa and mcalester, oklahoma, we agreed to indemnify, for an indefinite period, the buyers for costs relating to pre-closing environmental conditions and certain other items. it is impossible to assess the potential number of future claims that may be asserted under these indemnifications, nor the amounts thereof (if any). as a result, we cannot estimate the maximum potential amount of future payments under these indemnities and therefore, no liability has been recorded. to the extent that claims have been made under these indemnities and/or are probable and reasonably estimable, liabilities associated with these indemnities are included in the environmental liability disclosure in note 11.credit guarantees we have issued credit guarantees, principally to facilitate the sale and/or financing of commercial aircraft. under these arrangements, we are obligated to make payments to a guaranteed party in the event that lease or loan payments are not made by the original lessee or debtor or certain specified services are not performed. a substantial portion of these guarantees has been extended on behalf of original lessees or debtors with less than investment-grade credit. our commercial aircraft credit guarantees are collateralized by the underlying commercial aircraft and certain other assets. current outstanding credit guarantees expire within the next seven years.industrial revenue bondsindustrial revenue bonds (irb) issued by the city of wichita were used to finance the purchase and/or construction of real and personal property at our wichita site. tax benefits associated with irbs include a ten-year property tax abatement and a sales tax exemption from the kansas department of revenue. we record the property on our consolidated statements of financial position, along with a capital lease obligation to repay the proceeds of the irb. we have also purchased the irbs and therefore are the bondholders as well as the borrower/lessee of the property purchased with the irb proceeds.the capital lease obligation and irb asset are recorded net in the consolidated statements of financial position. as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, the assets and liabilities associated with the city of wichita irbs were $690 and $738.83table of contentsnote 13  debton may3, 2013, we issued $350 of fixed rate senior notes due may15, 2018 (fixed rate senior notes) and $150 of floating rate senior notes due november3, 2014 (floating rate senior notes). the fixed rate senior notes bear an annual interest rate of 0.95%, and may be redeemed at our option at any time for a redemption price equal to the full principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest and a make-whole premium. the floating rate senior notes bear an annual interest rate of three-month libor plus one basis point, and are not redeemable prior to maturity. the notes are unsecured senior obligations and rank equally in right of payment with our existing and future unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness. the net proceeds of the issuance totaling $494, after deducting underwriting discounts, commissions and offering expenses, were used to fund bcc.interest incurred, including amounts capitalized, was $548, $625 and $683 for the years ended december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. interest expense recorded by bcc is reflected as a separate line item on our consolidated statements of operations, and is included in earnings from operations. total company interest payments were $551, $614 and $626 for the years ended december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.we have $4,845 currently available under credit line agreements, of which $2,392 is a 364-day revolving credit facility expiring in november 2014 and $2,453 is a five-year credit facility, of which $2,393 expires in november 2018 and $60 in november 2017. the 364-day credit facility has a one-year term out option which allows us to extend the maturity of any borrowings one year beyond the aforementioned expiration date.

pension plans. all nonunion and some union employees hired after december31, 2008 are not covered by defined benefit plans. we fund our major pension plans through trusts. pension assets are placed in trust solely for the benefit of the plans participants, and are structured to maintain liquidity that is sufficient to pay benefit obligations as well as to keep pace over the long-term with the growth of obligations for future benefit payments.we also have other postretirement benefits (opb) other than pensions which consist principally of health care coverage for eligible retirees and qualifying dependents, and to a lesser extent, life insurance to certain groups of retirees. retiree health care is provided principally until age 65 for approximately half those retirees who are eligible for health care coverage. certain employee groups, including employees covered by most united auto workers bargaining agreements, are provided lifetime health care coverage.the funded status of the plans is measured as the difference between the plan assets at fair value and the projected benefit obligation (pbo). we have recognized the aggregate of all overfunded plans in other assets, and the aggregate of all underfunded plans in either accrued retiree health care or accrued pension plan liability, net. the portion of the amount by which the actuarial present value of benefits included in the pbo exceeds the fair value of plan assets, payable in the next 12 months, is reflected in accrued liabilities. the components of net periodic benefit cost were as follows:pensionother

determined the accumulated benefit obligation (abo) for certain other postretirement benefit plans was understated. as a result, we recognized an additional $294 of postretirement benefit obligations at september30, 2011. this increased net periodic benefit cost during 2011 by $184, which includes service cost of $73, interest cost of $68 and recognized net actuarial loss of $43.under our accounting policy, a portion of net periodic benefit cost is allocated to production as inventoried costs. of the $184 increase in net periodic benefit cost described above, the associated cost included in earnings from operations was $161 for the quarter ended september30, 2011, with the remaining cost of $23 classified as inventory.the following tables show changes in the benefit obligation, plan assets and funded status of both pensions and opb for the years ended december 31, 2013 and 2012. benefit obligation balances presented below reflect the pbo for our pension plans,

on plan assets7.50%7.50%7.75%rate of compensation increase4.00%4.00%3.90%the discount rate for each plan is determined based on the plans expected future benefit payments using a yield curve developed from high quality bonds that are rated as aa or better by at least half of the four rating agencies utilized as of the measurement date. the yield curve is fitted to yields developed from bonds at various maturity points. bonds with the ten percent highest and the ten percent lowest yields are omitted. a portfolio of about 400 bonds is used to construct the yield curve. since corporate bond yields are generally not available at maturities beyond 30 years, it is assumed that spot rates will remain level beyond that 30-year point. the present value of each plans benefits is calculated by applying the spot/discount rates to projected benefit cash flows. all bonds are u.s. issues, with a minimum outstanding of $50.87table of contentsthe pension funds expected return on plan assets assumption is derived from a review of actual historical returns achieved by the pension trust and anticipated future long-term performance of individual asset classes. while consideration is given to recent trust performance and historical returns, the assumption represents a long-term, prospective return. the expected return on plan assets component of the net periodic benefit cost for the upcoming plan year is determined based on the expected return on plan assets assumption and the market-related value of plan assets (mrva). since our adoption of the accounting standard for pensions in 1987, we have determined the mrva based on a five-year moving average of plan assets. as of december31, 2013, the mrva is approximately $1,340 less than the fair market value of assets.assumed health care cost trend rates were as follows:december31,201320122011health care cost trend rate assumed next year7.00%7.50%7.50%ultimate trend rate5.00%5.00%5.00%year that trend reached ultimate

sponsors and national health trends, and adjustments for plan design changes, workforce changes, and changes in plan participant behavior. a one-percentage-point change in assumed health care cost trend rates would have the following effect:increasedecreaseeffect on total of service and interest cost$57($47)effect on postretirement benefit obligation681(575)plan assetsinvestment strategy the overall objective of our pension assets is to earn a rate of return over time to satisfy the benefit obligations of the pension plans and to maintain sufficient liquidity to pay benefits and address other cash requirements of the pension fund. specific investment objectives for our long-term investment strategy include reducing the volatility of pension assets relative to pension liabilities, achieving a competitive, total investment return, achieving diversification between and within asset classes and managing other risks. investment objectives for each asset class are determined based on specific risks and investment opportunities identified.we periodically update our long-term, strategic asset allocations. we use various analytics to determine the optimal asset mix and consider plan liability characteristics, liquidity characteristics, funding requirements, expected rates of return and the distribution of returns. we identify investment benchmarks for the asset classes in the strategic asset allocation that are market-based and investable where possible.actual allocations to each asset class vary from target allocations due to periodic investment strategy changes, market value fluctuations, the length of time it takes to fully implement investment allocation positions (such as private equity and real estate), and the timing of benefit payments and contributions. short-term investments and exchange-traded derivatives are used to rebalance the actual asset allocation to the target asset allocation. the asset allocation is monitored and rebalanced on a monthly basis.88table of contentsthe actual and target allocations by asset class for the pension assets at december31 were as follows:actual allocationstarget allocationsasset

across different asset classes or markets, primarily using long-short positions in derivatives and physical securities. hedge fund strategy types include, but are not limited to, event driven, relative value, long-short and multi-strategy.investment managers are retained for explicit investment roles specified by contractual investment guidelines. certain investment managers are authorized to invest in derivatives, such as equity or bond futures, swaps, options and currency futures or forwards. derivatives are used to achieve the desired market exposure of a security or an index, transfer value-added performance between asset classes, achieve the desired currency exposure, adjust portfolio duration or rebalance the total portfolio to the target asset allocation.as a percentage of total pension plan assets, derivative net notional amounts were 18.3% and 10.0% for fixed income, including to-be-announced mortgage-backed securities and treasury forwards, and (2.2%) and (0.3)% for global equity, currency overlay and commodities at december 31, 2013 and 2012.risk management in managing the plan assets, we review and manage risk associated with funded status risk, interest rate risk, market risk, counterparty risk, liquidity risk and operational risk. liability matching and asset class diversification are central to our risk management approach and are integral to the overall investment strategy. further, asset classes are constructed to achieve diversification by investment strategy, by investment manager, by industry or sector and by holding. investment manager guidelines for publicly traded assets are specified and are monitored regularly through the custodian. credit parameters for counterparties have been established for managers permitted to trade over-the-counter derivatives. valuation is governed through several types of procedures, including reviews of manager valuation policies, custodian valuation processes, pricing vendor practices, pricing reconciliation, and periodic, security-specific valuation testing.89table of contentsfair value measurements the following table presents our plan assets using the fair value hierarchy as of december 31, 2013 and 2012. the fair value hierarchy has three levels based on the reliability of the inputs used to determine fair value. level 1 refers to fair values determined based on quoted prices in active markets for identical assets. level 2 refers to fair values estimated using significant other observable inputs, and level 3 includes fair values estimated using significant unobservable inputs.december31, 2013december31, 2012totallevel 1level 2level3totallevel 1level 2level3fixed income securities:corporate$15,262$15,238$24$14,363$14,360$3u.s. government and

income strategy were reclassified from private equity to other fixed income on january 1, 2013.90table of contentsfixed income securities are primarily valued upon a market approach, using matrix pricing and considering a securitys relationship to other securities for which quoted prices in an active market may be available, or an income approach, converting future cash flows to a single present value amount. inputs used in developing fair value estimates include reported trades, broker quotes, benchmark yields, and base spreads.common/collective/pooled funds are typically common or collective trusts valued at their net asset values (navs) that are calculated by the investment manager or sponsor of the fund and have daily or monthly liquidity. derivatives included in the table above are over-the-counter and are primarily valued using an income approach with inputs that include benchmark yields, swap curves, cash flow analysis, rating agency data and interdealer broker rates. exchange-traded derivative positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.cash equivalents and other short-term investments (which are used to pay benefits) are held in a separate account which consists of a commingled fund (with daily liquidity) and separately held short-term securities and cash equivalents. all of the investments in this cash vehicle are valued daily using a market approach with inputs that include quoted market prices for similar instruments. in the event a market price is not available for instruments with an original maturity of one year or less, amortized cost is used as a proxy for fair value. common and preferred stock equity securities are primarily valued using a market approach based on the quoted market prices of identical instruments. private equity and private debt nav valuations are based on the valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, operating results, discounted future cash flows and market based comparable data. for those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily lps) we use navs, adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events.real estate and real asset nav valuations are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which include inputs such as cost, discounted future cash flows, independent appraisals and market based comparable data. for those investments reported on a one-quarter lagged basis (primarily lps) navs are adjusted for subsequent cash flows and significant events. publicly traded reits and infrastructure stocks are valued using a market approach based on quoted market prices of identical instruments. exchange-traded commodities futures positions are reported in accordance with changes in daily variation margin which is settled daily and therefore reflected in the payables and receivables portion of the table.global strategies investments are primarily limited liability company (llc) or mutual fund structures. the navs are based on valuation of the underlying investments, which are primarily valued using a market approach. the funds generally have monthly liquidity.hedge funds consist of fund-of-fund llc structures and direct hedge funds. the navs of the fund-of-funds are based on the navs of the underlying hedge funds as well as any cash and accruals held at the fund-of-fund level. for direct hedge funds the navs are primarily based on valuation of the underlying investments. this is primarily done by applying a market or income valuation methodology depending on the specific type of security or instrument held. redemptions in hedge funds are based on specific terms and conditions of the individual funds.investments in private equity, private debt, real estate, real assets, global strategies, and hedge funds are primarily calculated and reported by the general partner (gp), fund manager or third party administrator. pension assets invested in these structures rely on the nav of these investments as the practical expedient for the valuations.91table

of approximately 60% equities and 40% debt securities. the index fund is valued using a market approach based on the quoted market price of an identical instrument (level 1). the expected rate of return on these assets does not have a material effect on the net periodic benefit cost.cash flowscontributions required pension contributions under the employee retirement income security act (erisa), as well as rules governing funding of our non-u.s. pension plans, are expected to be minimal in 2014. we expect to make discretionary contributions to our plans of approximately $750 in 2014. we expect to contribute approximately $12 to our opb plans in 2014.estimated future benefit payments the table below reflects the total pension benefits expected to be paid from the plans or from our assets, including both our share of the benefit cost and the participants share of the cost, which is funded by participant contributions. opb payments reflect our portion

board of directors and the plans are terminated within five years thereafter, the assets in the plan first will be used to provide the level of retirement benefits required by erisa, and then any surplus will be used to fund a trust to continue present and future payments under the postretirement medical and life insurance benefits in our group insurance benefit programs.we have an agreement with the u.s. government with respect to certain pension plans. under the agreement, should we terminate any of the plans under conditions in which the plans assets exceed that plans obligations, the u.s. government will be entitled to a fair allocation of any of the plans assets based on plan contributions that were reimbursed under u.s. government contracts.defined contribution planswe provide certain defined contribution plans to all eligible employees. the principal plans are the company-sponsored 401(k) plans. the expense for these defined contribution plans was $742, $708 and $658 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.93table of contentsnote 15  share-based compensation and other compensation arrangementsshare-based compensationour 2003 incentive stock plan, as amended and restated effective february21, 2011, permits awards of incentive stock options, non-qualified stock options, restricted stock, stock units, performance shares, performance units and other incentives to our employees, officers, consultants and independent contractors. the aggregate number of shares of our stock available for issuance under the amended plan will not exceed 80,000,000 and no more than an aggregate of 16,000,000 shares are available for issuance as restricted stock awards.shares issued as a result of stock option exercises or conversion of stock unit awards will be funded out of treasury shares, except to the extent there are insufficient treasury shares, in which case new shares will be issued. we believe we currently have adequate treasury shares to meet any requirements to issue shares during 2014.share-based plans expense is primarily included in general and administrative expense since it is incentive compensation issued primarily to our executives. the share-based plans expense and related income tax benefit were as follows:years ended december31,201320122011stock options$93$85$88restricted stock units and other awards11310898share-based plans

granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of our stock on the date of grant and expire ten years after the date of grant. the stock options vest over a period of three years, with 34% vesting after the first year, 33% vesting after the second year and the remaining 33% vesting after the third year. if an executive terminates employment for any reason, the non-vested portion of the stock option will not vest and all rights to the non-vested portion will terminate completely.stock option activity for the year ended december31, 2013 is as follows:sharesweighted average

from options exercised for the years ended december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $1,097, $120 and $114 with a related tax benefit of $190, $29 and $23, respectively, derived from the compensation deductions resulting from these option exercises. at december31, 2013, there was $95 of total unrecognized compensation cost related to our stock option plan which is expected to be recognized over a weighted average period of 1.8 years. the grant date fair value of stock options vested during the years ended december 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $89, $83 and $92, respectively.the fair values of options were estimated using the black-scholes option-pricing model with the following assumptions:grant yeargrant dateexpected lifeexpected volatilityexpected dividend yieldrisk free interest rateweighted-average grant date fair value per share20132/25/20136 years29.0%2.6%1.0%$15.8520122/27/20126 years29.9%2.4%1.1%$16.8920112/22/20116 years29.8%2.3%2.5%$17.96the expected volatility of the stock options is based on a combination of our historical stock volatility and the volatility levels implied on the grant date by actively traded option contracts on our common stock. we determined the expected term of the stock option grants to be six years, calculated using the simplified method in accordance with the sec staff accounting bulletin 110. we use the simplified method since we changed the vesting terms, tax treatment and the recipients of our stock options beginning in 2006 such that we believe our historical data prior to 2006 does not provide a reasonable basis upon which to estimate expected term and we do not have enough option exercise data from our grants issued subsequent to 2006 to support our own estimate as a result of vesting terms and changes in the stock price.restricted stock unitsin february2013, 2012 and 2011, we granted to our executives 1,375,414, 1,369,810 and 1,364,440 restricted stock units (rsus) as part of our long-term incentive program with grant date fair values of $75.97, $75.40 and $71.44 per share, respectively. the rsus granted under this program will vest and settle in common stock (on a one-for-one basis) on the third anniversary of the grant date. if an executive terminates employment because of retirement, involuntary layoff, disability, or death, the employee (or beneficiary) will immediately vest on a proration of stock units based on active employment during the three-year service period. in all other cases, the rsus will not vest and all rights to the stock units will terminate completely. in addition to rsus awarded under our long-term incentive program, we grant rsus to certain executives and employees to encourage retention or to reward various achievements.these rsus are labeled other restricted stock units in the table below. the fair values of all rsus are estimated using the average stock price on the date of grant. stock units settle in common stock on a one-for-one basis and are not contingent upon stock price.95table of contentsstock unit activity for the year ended december31, 2013 is as follows:incentiveprogram restrictedstockunitsotherrestrictedstock unitsnumber of

that pay out based on the achievement of long-term financial goals at the end of a three-year period. each unit has an initial value of $100 dollars. the amount payable at the end of the three-year performance period may be anywhere from $0 to $200 dollars per unit, depending on the companys performance against plan for a three-year period. the compensation committee has the discretion to pay these awards in cash, stock, or a combination of both after the three-year performance period. compensation expense, based on the estimated performance payout, is recognized ratably over the performance period.during 2013, 2012 and 2011, we granted performance awards to our executives with the payout based on the achievement of financial goals for each three-year period following the grant date. the minimum payout amount is $0 and the maximum amount we could be required to pay out for the 2013, 2012 and 2011 performance awards is $275, $259 and $248, respectively. the 2011 grant is expected to be paid out in cash in march 2014.deferred compensationthe company has a deferred compensation plan which permits executives to defer receipt of a portion of their salary, bonus, and certain other incentive awards. participants can diversify deferred compensation among 23 investment funds including a boeing stock unit account.total expense related to deferred compensation was $238, $75 and $59 in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. as of december 31, 2013 and 2012, the deferred compensation liability which is being marked to market was $1,258 and $1,104.96note 16  shareholders equityon october29, 2007, the board approved the repurchase of up to $7,000 of common stock (the 2007 program). at december31, 2013, $810 in shares may still be repurchased under the program. on december 16, 2013, the board approved a new repurchase plan (the 2013 program) for up to $10,000 of common stock that commences following the completion of the 2007 program. unless terminated earlier by a board resolution, the program will expire when we have used all authorized funds for repurchase. as of december31, 2013 and 2012, there were 1,200,000,000 shares of common

swaps, and commodity purchase contracts. we use foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage currency risk associated with certain transactions, specifically forecasted sales and purchases made in foreign currencies. our foreign currency contracts hedge forecasted transactions principally occurring within five years in the future, with certain contracts hedging transactions through 2023. we use commodity derivatives, such as swaps and fixed-price purchase commitments to hedge against potentially unfavorable price changes for items used in production. our commodity contracts hedge forecasted transactions through 2017.fair value hedgesinterest rate swaps under which we agree to pay variable rates of interest are designated as fair value hedges of fixed-rate debt. the net change in fair value of the derivatives and the hedged items is reported in boeing capital interest expense.98derivative instruments not receiving hedge accounting treatmentwe also hold certain

based on the present value of the forward rate less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. commodity derivatives are valued using an income approach based on the present value of the commodity index prices less the contract rate multiplied by the notional amount. the fair value of our interest rate swaps is derived from a discounted cash flow analysis based on the terms of the contract and the interest rate curve.certain assets have been measured at fair value on a nonrecurring basis using significant unobservable inputs (level 3). the following table presents the nonrecurring losses recognized for the years ended december31, and the fair value and asset classification of the related assets as of the impairment date:20132012fair valuetotal lossesfair valuetotal lossesoperating lease equipment$216($81)$75($55)property, plant and equipment40(15)21(21)total$256($96)$96($76)the fair value of the impaired operating lease equipment is derived by calculating a median collateral value from a consistent group of third party aircraft value publications. the values provided by the third party aircraft publications are derived from their knowledge of market trades and other market factors. management reviews the publications quarterly to assess the continued appropriateness and consistency with market trends. under certain circumstances, we adjust values based on the attributes and condition of the specific aircraft or equipment, usually when the features or use of the aircraft vary significantly from the more generic aircraft attributes covered by third party publications, or on the expected net sales price for the aircraft.property, plant and equipment was primarily valued using an income approach based on the discounted cash flows associated with the underlying assets. for level 3 assets that were measured at fair value on a non-recurring basis during the year ended december 31, 2012, the following table presents the fair value of those assets as of the measurement date, valuation techniques and related unobservable inputs of those assets.fairvaluevaluationtechnique(s)unobservable inputrangemedianoraverageoperating lease

rates for loans of the same risk and maturities. the fair values of our variable rate notes receivable that reprice frequently approximate their carrying amounts. the fair values of fixed rate notes receivable are estimated with discounted cash flow analysis using interest rates currently offered on loans with similar terms to borrowers of similar credit quality. the fair value of our debt that is traded in the secondary market is classified as level 2 and is based on current market yields. for our debt that is not traded in the secondary market, the fair value is classified as level 2 and is based on our indicative borrowing cost derived from dealer quotes or discounted cash flows. the fair value of our debt classified as level 3 is based on the median of the underlying collateral value as described above. with regard to other financial instruments with off-balance sheet risk, it is not practicable to estimate the fair value of our indemnifications and financing commitments because the amount and timing of those arrangements are uncertain. items not included in the above disclosures include cash, restricted cash, time deposits and other deposits, commercial paper, money market funds, accounts payable and long-term payables. the carrying values of those items, as reflected in the consolidated statements of financial position, approximate their fair value at december 31, 2013 and 2012. the fair value of assets and liabilities whose carrying value approximates fair value is determined using level 2 inputs, with the exception of cash (level 1).102table of contentsnote 20  legal proceedingsvarious legal proceedings, claims and investigations related to products, contracts and other matters are pending against us. potentially material contingencies are discussed below. in addition, the discussion below addresses the settlement of the a-12 litigation.we are subject to various u.s. government investigations, from which civil, criminal or administrative proceedings could result or have resulted in the past. such proceedings involve or could involve claims by the government for fines, penalties, compensatory and treble damages, restitution and/or forfeitures. under government regulations, a company, or one or more of its operating divisions or subdivisions, can also be suspended or debarred from government contracts, or lose its export privileges, based on the results of investigations. we believe, based upon current information, that the outcome of any such government disputes and investigations will not have a material effect on our financial position, results of operations, or cash flows, except as set forth below. where it is reasonably possible that we will incur losses in excess of recorded amounts in connection with any of the matters set forth below, we have disclosed either the amount or range of reasonably possible losses in excess of such amounts or, where no such amount or range can be reasonably estimated, the reasons why no such estimate can be made.a-12 litigationin 1991, the department of the navy (the navy) notified mcdonnell douglas corporation (now merged into the boeing company) and general dynamics corporation (together, the team) that it was terminating for default the teams contract for development and initial production of the a-12 aircraft.the team had full responsibility for performance of the contract and both contractors are jointly and severally liable for any potential liabilities resulting from the termination. the team filed a legal action to contest the navys default termination, to assert its rights to convert the termination to one for the convenience of the government, and to obtain payment for work done and costs incurred on the a-12 contract but not paid to date.the u.s. court of federal claims held that the default termination decision could not be sustained and on march 31, 1998, awarded the team $1,200 in unreimbursed costs. the court of appeals for the federal circuit reversed in july 1999 and remanded the case back to the trial court to determine whether the team was in fact in default. on august31, 2001, the u.s. court of federal claims issued a decision after trial upholding the governments default termination of the a-12 contract. in 2003, the court of appeals for the federal circuit, finding that the trial court had applied the wrong legal standard, vacated the trial courts 2001 decision and ordered the case sent back to the trial court for further proceedings. on may3, 2007, the u.s. court of federal claims issued a decision upholding the governments default termination of the a-12 contract. we filed a notice of appeal on may4, 2007 with the court of appeals for the federal circuit. on june2, 2009, the court of appeals rendered an opinion affirming the trial courts 2007 decision sustaining the governments default termination. on may23, 2011, the u.s. supreme court vacated the decision of the court of appeals upholding the default termination, and remanded the case to the court of appeals. on july7, 2011, the court of appeals remanded the case to the trial court for additional factual determinations and the trial court heard oral argument on may 7, 2013. on december29, 2009, the navy sent letters to the team requesting payment of $1,352 in unliquidated progress payments, plus applicable interest. on november15, 2011, the navy sent a letter confirming that it would not pursue payment from the team pending all trial court and appellate proceedings adjudicating the issues remanded by the supreme court.on may 17, 2013, the president's fiscal 2014 budget request to congress included a new department of defense general provision that would authorize the secretary of the navy to receive and retain payment in-kind in settlement of the a-12 aircraft litigation. on july 30, 2013, the team and the navy executed a settlement agreement that took effect upon enactment of the authorization legislation on december 26, 103table of contents2013. the parties signed a contract modification effectuating the settlement on january 13, 2014 and, on january 23, 2014, the parties filed a stipulation of dismissal with the court, voluntarily dismissing the litigation with prejudice. as a result, the company recorded a $406 pre-tax charge in 2013, which consists of writing-off a-12 inventory, recorded as cost of sales, and providing three ea-18g growlers at no cost to the u.s. navy, recorded as a reduction in revenues. employment, labor and benefits litigationin connection with the 2005 sale of our former wichita facility to spirit aerosystems, inc. (spirit), certain individuals not hired by spirit alleged that spirits hiring decisions following the sale were tainted by age discrimination, violated erisa, violated our collective bargaining agreements, and constituted retaliation. the case was brought in 2006 as a class action on behalf of individuals not hired by spirit. in 2012, the tenth circuit court of appeals affirmed the district court's 2010 summary judgment in favor of boeing and spirit on all class action claims, but the parties were not precluded from making claims on an individual basis. as of december 31, 2013, eighty-eight individual claims related to this matter were pending. spirit has agreed to indemnify boeing for any and all losses.also related to the 2005 sale of the former wichita facility, on february 16, 2007, an action entitled harkness et al. v. the boeing company et al. was filed in the u.s. district court for the district of kansas, alleging collective bargaining agreement breaches and erisa violations in connection with alleged failures to provide benefits to certain former employees of the wichita facility. on december 11, 2012 the court denied plaintiffs motion for summary judgment and granted boeings motion for summary judgment on plaintiffs claim that amendment of the boeing company employee retirement plan violated the iam collective bargaining agreement, as well as individual erisa 510 claims for interference with benefits. the court denied boeings motion for all other claims. the parties are conducting additional discovery in anticipation of further court proceedings, which have not yet been scheduled. we believe that spirit is obligated to indemnify boeing for any and all losses in this matter, although to date spirit has acknowledged a limited indemnification obligation. we currently estimate that the putative class includes 2,000 former wichita employees. we cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from both these matters given the current procedural status of the litigation.on october13, 2006, we were named as a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the u.s. district court for the southern district of illinois. plaintiffs, seeking to represent a class of similarly situated participants and beneficiaries in the boeing company voluntary investment plan (the vip), alleged that fees and expenses incurred by the vip were and are unreasonable and excessive, not incurred solely for the benefit of the vip and its participants, and were undisclosed to participants. the plaintiffs further alleged that defendants breached their fiduciary duties in violation of 502(a)(2) of erisa, and sought injunctive and equitable relief pursuant to 502(a)(3) of erisa. during the first quarter of 2010, the seventh circuit court of appeals granted a stay of trial proceedings in the district court pending resolution of an appeal made by boeing in 2008 to the cases class certification order. on january21, 2011, the seventh circuit reversed the district courts class certification order and decertified the class. the seventh circuit remanded the case to the district court for further proceedings. on september 19, 2013, the district court granted plaintiffs motion for class certification. on october 3, 2013, boeing filed a petition for review of the class certification order with the seventh circuit court of appeals, which was denied by the seventh circuit on november 26, 2013. summary judgment briefs were filed in the district court on january 6, 2014, and plaintiffs opposition briefs were filed on february 10, 2013. we cannot reasonably estimate the range of loss, if any, that may result from this matter given the current procedural status of the litigation.104table of

audits in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free of material misstatement. an audit includes examining, on a test basis, evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. an audit also includes assessing the accounting principles used and significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall financial statement presentation. we believe that our

responsibility is to express an opinion on the companys internal control over financial reporting based on our audit.we conducted our audit in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states). those standards require that we plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether effective internal control over financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. our audit included obtaining an understanding of internal control over financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of internal control based on the assessed risk, and performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the circumstances. we believe that our audit provides a reasonable basis for our opinion.a companys internal control over financial reporting is a process designed by, or under the supervision of, the companys principal executive and principal financial officers, or persons performing similar functions, and effected by the companys board of directors, management, and other personnel to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles. a companys internal control over financial reporting includes those policies and procedures that (1)pertain to the maintenance of records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (2)provide reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of the company are being made only in accordance with authorizations of management and directors of the company; and (3)provide reasonable assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorized acquisition, use, or disposition of the companys assets that could have a material effect on the financial statements.because of the inherent limitations of internal control over financial reporting, including the possibility of collusion or improper management override of controls, material misstatements due to error or fraud may not be prevented or detected on a timely basis. also, projections of any evaluation of the effectiveness of the internal control over financial reporting to future periods are subject to the risk that the controls may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.in our opinion, the company maintained, in all material respects, effective internal control over financial reporting as of december 31, 2013, based on the criteria established in internal control  integrated framework (1992) issued by the committee of sponsoring organizations of the treadway commission.we have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the public company accounting oversight board (united states), the
