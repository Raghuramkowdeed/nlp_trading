ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

AN INVESTMENT IN OUR COMMON STOCK OR DEBT SECURITIES INVOLVES RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES AND OUR ACTUAL RESULTS AND FUTURE TRENDS MAY DIFFER MATERIALLY FROM OUR PAST OR PROJECTED FUTURE PERFORMANCE. WE URGE INVESTORS TO CONSIDER CAREFULLY THE RISK FACTORS DESCRIBED BELOW IN EVALUATING THE INFORMATION CONTAINED IN THIS REPORT.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES BUSINESS DEPENDS HEAVILY ON COMMERCIAL AIRLINES, AND IS SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS.

MARKET CONDITIONS HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON DEMAND FOR OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT.

THE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT MARKET IS PREDOMINANTLY DRIVEN BY LONG-TERM TRENDS IN AIRLINE PASSENGER AND CARGO TRAFFIC. THE PRINCIPAL FACTORS UNDERLYING LONG-TERM TRAFFIC GROWTH ARE SUSTAINED ECONOMIC GROWTH AND POLITICAL STABILITY BOTH IN DEVELOPED AND EMERGING MARKETS. DEMAND FOR OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT IS FURTHER INFLUENCED BY AIRLINE PROFITABILITY, AVAILABILITY OF AIRCRAFT FINANCING, WORLD TRADE POLICIES, GOVERNMENT-TO-GOVERNMENT RELATIONS, TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGES, PRICE AND OTHER COMPETITIVE FACTORS, FUEL PRICES, TERRORISM, EPIDEMICS AND ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS. TRADITIONALLY, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN CYCLICAL AND VERY COMPETITIVE AND HAS EXPERIENCED SIGNIFICANT PROFIT SWINGS AND CONSTANT CHALLENGES TO BE MORE COST COMPETITIVE. IN ADDITION, AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING TO NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS DEPENDS IN PART ON THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES, WHOSE CURRENT AUTHORIZATION EXPIRES AT THE END OF SEPTEMBER 2014. SIGNIFICANT DETERIORATION IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT, THE AIRLINE INDUSTRY GENERALLY, OR IN THE FINANCIAL STABILITY OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR MAJOR CUSTOMERS COULD RESULT IN FEWER NEW ORDERS FOR AIRCRAFT OR COULD CAUSE CUSTOMERS TO SEEK TO POSTPONE OR CANCEL CONTRACTUAL ORDERS AND/OR PAYMENTS TO US, WHICH COULD RESULT IN LOWER REVENUES, PROFITABILITY AND CASH FLOWS AND A REDUCTION IN OUR CONTRACTUAL BACKLOG. IN ADDITION, BECAUSE OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT BACKLOG CONSISTS OF AIRCRAFT SCHEDULED FOR DELIVERY OVER A PERIOD OF SEVERAL YEARS, ANY OF THESE MACROECONOMIC, INDUSTRY OR CUSTOMER IMPACTS COULD UNEXPECTEDLY AFFECT DELIVERIES OVER A LONG PERIOD.

WE ENTER INTO FIRM FIXED-PRICE AIRCRAFT SALES CONTRACTS WITH INDEXED PRICE ESCALATION CLAUSES WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO LOSSES IF WE HAVE COST OVERRUNS OR IF INCREASES IN OUR COSTS EXCEED THE APPLICABLE ESCALATION RATE.

COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT SALES CONTRACTS ARE OFTEN ENTERED INTO YEARS BEFORE THE AIRCRAFT ARE DELIVERED. IN ORDER TO ACCOUNT FOR ECONOMIC FLUCTUATIONS BETWEEN THE CONTRACT DATE AND DELIVERY DATE, AIRCRAFT PRICING GENERALLY CONSISTS OF A FIXED AMOUNT AS MODIFIED BY AN INDEXED PRICE ESCALATION FORMULA. OUR REVENUE ESTIMATES ARE BASED ON CURRENT EXPECTATIONS WITH RESPECT TO THESE ESCALATION FORMULAS, BUT THE ACTUAL ESCALATION AMOUNTS ARE OUTSIDE OF OUR CONTROL. ESCALATION FACTORS CAN FLUCTUATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PERIOD TO PERIOD. CHANGES IN ESCALATION AMOUNTS CAN SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT REVENUES AND OPERATING MARGINS IN OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES BUSINESS.

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM A LIMITED NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL AIRLINES.

WE CAN MAKE NO ASSURANCE THAT ANY CUSTOMER WILL EXERCISE PURCHASE OPTIONS, FULFILL EXISTING PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OR PURCHASE ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES FROM US. IN ADDITION, FLEET DECISIONS, AIRLINE CONSOLIDATIONS OR FINANCIAL CHALLENGES INVOLVING ANY OF OUR MAJOR COMMERCIAL AIRLINE CUSTOMERS COULD SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND LIMIT OUR OPPORTUNITY TO GENERATE PROFITS FROM THOSE CUSTOMERS.

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO MAINTAIN A HEALTHY PRODUCTION SYSTEM, ACHIEVE PLANNED PRODUCTION RATE TARGETS, SUCCESSFULLY DEVELOP NEW AIRCRAFT OR NEW DERIVATIVE AIRCRAFT, AND MEET OR EXCEED STRINGENT PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY STANDARDS.

THE COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT BUSINESS IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX, INVOLVING EXTENSIVE COORDINATION AND INTEGRATION WITH SUPPLIERS, HIGHLY-SKILLED LABOR FROM THOUSANDS OF EMPLOYEES AND OTHER PARTNERS, AND STRINGENT REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AND PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY STANDARDS. IN ADDITION, THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS AND/OR DERIVATIVES, SUCH AS THE 787-9, 787-10, 737 MAX AND 777X, INVOLVES INCREASED RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH MEETING DEVELOPMENT, TESTING, PRODUCTION AND CERTIFICATION SCHEDULES. AS A RESULT, OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER AIRCRAFT ON TIME, SATISFY REGULATORY AND CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS, AND ACHIEVE OR MAINTAIN, AS APPLICABLE, PROGRAM PROFITABILITY IS SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS.

WE MUST MEET PLANNED PRODUCTION RATE TARGETS IN ORDER TO SATISFY CUSTOMER DEMAND AND MAINTAIN OUR PROFITABILITY.

WE CONTINUE TO INCREASE PRODUCTION RATES FOR THE 737 AND 787 PROGRAMS, WHILE AT THE SAME TIME ENGAGING IN SIGNIFICANT ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OF THE 787-9, 787-10, 737 MAX AND 777X AIRCRAFT. IF PRODUCTION RATE RAMP-UP EFFORTS AT ANY OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT ASSEMBLY FACILITIES ARE DELAYED OR IF OUR SUPPLIERS CANNOT TIMELY DELIVER COMPONENTS TO US AT THE RATES NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE OUR PLANNED RATE

INCREASES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MEET DELIVERY SCHEDULES AND THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF ONE OR MORE OF OUR PROGRAMS MAY SUFFER.

OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES IMPACTING THE PRODUCTION SYSTEM FOR ONE OR MORE OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS COULD RESULT IN PRODUCTION DELAYS AND/OR FAILURE TO MEET CUSTOMER DEMAND FOR NEW AIRCRAFT, EITHER OF WHICH WOULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING MARGINS.

OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PRODUCTION SYSTEM IS EXTREMELY COMPLEX. OPERATIONAL ISSUES, INCLUDING DELAYS OR DEFECTS IN SUPPLIER COMPONENTS, FAILURE TO MEET INTERNAL PERFORMANCE PLANS, OR DELAYS OR FAILURES TO ACHIEVE REQUIRED REGULATORY CERTIFICATIONS, COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT OUT-OF-SEQUENCE WORK AND INCREASED PRODUCTION COSTS, AS WELL AS DELAYED DELIVERIES TO CUSTOMERS, IMPACTS TO AIRCRAFT PERFORMANCE AND/OR INCREASED WARRANTY OR FLEET SUPPORT COSTS. FURTHER, IF WE CANNOT EFFICIENTLY AND COST-EFFECTIVELY INCORPORATE DESIGN CHANGES INTO ALREADY-COMPLETED 787 PRODUCTION AIRCRAFT, WE MAY FACE FURTHER PROFITABILITY PRESSURES ON THIS PROGRAM.

IF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES FAIL TO SATISFY PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD FACE ADDITIONAL COSTS AND/OR LOWER REVENUES.

DEVELOPING AND MANUFACTURING COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT THAT MEET OR EXCEED OUR PERFORMANCE AND RELIABILITY STANDARDS, AS WELL AS THOSE OF CUSTOMERS AND REGULATORY AGENCIES, CAN BE COSTLY AND TECHNOLOGICALLY CHALLENGING. THESE CHALLENGES ARE PARTICULARLY SIGNIFICANT WITH NEWER AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS. ANY FAILURE OF ANY BOEING AIRCRAFT TO SATISFY PERFORMANCE OR RELIABILITY REQUIREMENTS COULD RESULT IN DISRUPTION TO OUR OPERATIONS, HIGHER COSTS AND/OR LOWER REVENUES.

CHANGES IN LEVELS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT DEFENSE SPENDING OR OVERALL ACQUISITION PRIORITIES COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE DERIVE A SUBSTANTIAL PORTION OF OUR REVENUE FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, PRIMARILY FROM DEFENSE RELATED PROGRAMS WITH THE

U.S. DOD

. LEVELS OF U.S. DEFENSE SPENDING IN FUTURE PERIODS ARE VERY DIFFICULT TO PREDICT AND SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT RISKS. IN ADDITION, SIGNIFICANT BUDGETARY DELAYS AND CONSTRAINTS HAVE ALREADY RESULTED IN REDUCED SPENDING LEVELS, AND ADDITIONAL REDUCTIONS MAY BE FORTHCOMING. IN AUGUST 2011, THE BUDGET CONTROL ACT (THE ACT) ESTABLISHED LIMITS ON U.S. GOVERNMENT DISCRETIONARY SPENDING, INCLUDING A REDUCTION OF DEFENSE SPENDING BY APPROXIMATELY $490 BILLION BETWEEN THE 2012 AND 2021 U.S. GOVERNMENT FISCAL YEARS. THE ACT ALSO PROVIDED THAT THE DEFENSE BUDGET WOULD FACE SEQUESTRATION CUTS OF UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $500 BILLION DURING THAT SAME PERIOD TO THE EXTENT THAT DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LIMITS ARE EXCEEDED. THE IMPACT OF SEQUESTRATION CUTS WAS REDUCED WITH RESPECT TO FY2014 AND FY2015 FOLLOWING THE ENACTMENT OF THE BIPARTISAN BUDGET ACT IN DECEMBER 2013. HOWEVER, SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY REMAINS WITH RESPECT TO OVERALL LEVELS OF DEFENSE SPENDING AND IT IS LIKELY THAT U.S. GOVERNMENT DISCRETIONARY SPENDING LEVELS WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT PRESSURE, INCLUDING RISK OF FUTURE SEQUESTRATION CUTS.

IN ADDITION, THERE CONTINUES TO BE SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO PROGRAM-LEVEL APPROPRIATIONS FOR THE

U.S. DOD

AND OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES (INCLUDING NASA) WITHIN THE OVERALL BUDGETARY FRAMEWORK DESCRIBED ABOVE. WHILE THE FY2014 APPROPRIATIONS FINALIZED IN JANUARY 2014 INCLUDED FUNDING FOR BOEINGS MAJOR PROGRAMS, UNCERTAINTY REMAINS ABOUT HOW DEFENSE BUDGETS IN FY2015 AND BEYOND WILL AFFECT BOEINGS PROGRAMS. WE ALSO EXPECT THAT ONGOING CONCERNS REGARDING THE U.S. NATIONAL DEBT WILL CONTINUE TO PLACE DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON U.S. DOD SPENDING LEVELS. FUTURE BUDGET CUTS,

INCLUDING CUTS MANDATED BY SEQUESTRATION, OR FUTURE PROCUREMENT DECISIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS COULD RESULT IN REDUCTIONS, CANCELLATIONS, AND/OR DELAYS OF EXISTING CONTRACTS OR PROGRAMS. ANY OF THESE IMPACTS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE RESULTS OF THE COMPANYS OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION AND/OR CASH FLOWS.

IN ADDITION, AS A RESULT OF THE SIGNIFICANT ONGOING UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO BOTH U.S. DEFENSE SPENDING LEVELS AND THE NATURE OF THE THREAT ENVIRONMENT, WE EXPECT THE

U.S. DOD

TO CONTINUE TO EMPHASIZE COST-CUTTING AND OTHER EFFICIENCY INITIATIVES IN ITS PROCUREMENT PROCESSES. IF WE CAN NO LONGER ADJUST SUCCESSFULLY TO THESE CHANGING ACQUISITION PRIORITIES AND/OR FAIL TO MEET AFFORDABILITY TARGETS SET BY THE

U.S. DOD

CUSTOMER, OUR REVENUES AND MARKET SHARE WOULD BE FURTHER IMPACTED.

WE CONDUCT A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS PURSUANT TO U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO UNIQUE RISKS.

IN

2013

,

34%

OF OUR REVENUES WERE EARNED PURSUANT TO U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, WHICH INCLUDE FOREIGN MILITARY SALES THROUGH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. BUSINESS CONDUCTED PURSUANT TO SUCH CONTRACTS IS SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS AND OTHER UNIQUE RISKS.

OUR SALES TO THE U.S. GOVERNMENT ARE SUBJECT TO EXTENSIVE PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS, AND CHANGES TO THOSE REGULATIONS COULD INCREASE OUR COSTS.

NEW PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS, OR CHANGES TO EXISTING REQUIREMENTS, COULD INCREASE OUR COMPLIANCE COSTS OR OTHERWISE HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE OPERATING MARGINS OF OUR BDS BUSINESS. THESE REQUIREMENTS MAY RESULT IN INCREASED COMPLIANCE COSTS, AND WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO ADDITIONAL COSTS IN THE FORM OF WITHHELD PAYMENTS AND/OR REDUCED FUTURE BUSINESS IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESE REQUIREMENTS IN THE FUTURE. COMPLIANCE COSTS ATTRIBUTABLE TO CURRENT AND POTENTIAL FUTURE PROCUREMENT REGULATIONS SUCH AS THESE COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT MAY MODIFY, CURTAIL OR TERMINATE ONE OR MORE OF OUR CONTRACTS.

THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTING PARTY MAY MODIFY, CURTAIL OR TERMINATE ITS CONTRACTS AND SUBCONTRACTS WITH US, WITHOUT PRIOR NOTICE AND EITHER AT ITS CONVENIENCE OR FOR DEFAULT BASED ON PERFORMANCE. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2011, THE U.S. ARMY TERMINATED FOR CONVENIENCE THE ENTIRE

BCTM

PROGRAM. IN ADDITION, FUNDING PURSUANT TO OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS MAY BE REDUCED OR WITHHELD AS PART OF THE U.S. CONGRESSIONAL APPROPRIATIONS PROCESS DUE TO FISCAL CONSTRAINTS, CHANGES IN U.S. NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY AND/OR PRIORITIES OR OTHER REASONS. FURTHER UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO ONGOING PROGRAMS COULD ALSO RESULT IN THE EVENT THAT THE U.S. GOVERNMENT FINANCES ITS OPERATIONS THROUGH TEMPORARY FUNDING MEASURES SUCH AS CONTINUING RESOLUTIONS RATHER THAN FULL-YEAR APPROPRIATIONS. ANY LOSS OR ANTICIPATED LOSS OR REDUCTION OF EXPECTED FUNDING AND/OR MODIFICATION, CURTAILMENT, OR TERMINATION OF ONE OR MORE LARGE PROGRAMS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOW AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO U.S. GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS, INCLUDING PERIODIC AUDITS OF COSTS THAT WE DETERMINE ARE REIMBURSABLE UNDER U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS.

U.S. GOVERNMENT AGENCIES, INCLUDING THE DEFENSE CONTRACT AUDIT AGENCY AND THE DEFENSE CONTRACT MANAGEMENT AGENCY, ROUTINELY AUDIT GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS. THESE AGENCIES REVIEW OUR PERFORMANCE UNDER CONTRACTS, COST STRUCTURE AND COMPLIANCE WITH APPLICABLE LAWS, REGULATIONS, AND STANDARDS, AS WELL AS THE ADEQUACY OF AND OUR COMPLIANCE WITH OUR INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS AND POLICIES. ANY COSTS FOUND TO BE MISCLASSIFIED OR INACCURATELY ALLOCATED TO A SPECIFIC CONTRACT WILL BE DEEMED NON-REIMBURSABLE, AND TO THE EXTENT ALREADY REIMBURSED, MUST BE REFUNDED. ANY INADEQUACIES IN OUR SYSTEMS AND POLICIES COULD RESULT IN WITHHOLDS ON BILLED RECEIVABLES, PENALTIES AND REDUCED FUTURE BUSINESS. FURTHERMORE, IF ANY AUDIT, INQUIRY OR INVESTIGATION UNCOVERS IMPROPER OR ILLEGAL ACTIVITIES, WE COULD BE SUBJECT TO CIVIL AND CRIMINAL PENALTIES AND ADMINISTRATIVE SANCTIONS, INCLUDING TERMINATION OF CONTRACTS, FORFEITURE OF PROFITS, SUSPENSION OF PAYMENTS, FINES, AND SUSPENSION OR DEBARMENT FROM DOING BUSINESS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. WE ALSO COULD SUFFER REPUTATIONAL HARM IF ALLEGATIONS OF IMPROPRIETY WERE MADE AGAINST US, EVEN IF SUCH ALLEGATIONS ARE LATER DETERMINED TO BE FALSE.

WE ENTER INTO FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS WHICH COULD SUBJECT US TO LOSSES IF WE HAVE COST OVERRUNS.

OUR BDS BUSINESS GENERATED APPROXIMATELY

70%

OF ITS

REVENUES FROM FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS. WHILE FIRM FIXED PRICE CONTRACTS ENABLE US TO BENEFIT FROM PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENTS, COST REDUCTIONS AND EFFICIENCIES, THEY ALSO SUBJECT US TO THE RISK OF REDUCED MARGINS OR INCURRING LOSSES IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ACHIEVE ESTIMATED COSTS AND REVENUES. IF OUR ESTIMATED COSTS EXCEED OUR ESTIMATED PRICE, WE RECOGNIZE REACH-FORWARD LOSSES WHICH CAN SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT OUR REPORTED RESULTS. THE LONG TERM NATURE OF MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS MAKES THE PROCESS OF ESTIMATING COSTS AND REVENUES ON FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS INHERENTLY RISKY. FIXED-PRICE CONTRACTS OFTEN CONTAIN PRICE INCENTIVES AND PENALTIES TIED TO PERFORMANCE WHICH CAN BE DIFFICULT TO ESTIMATE AND HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS ON MARGINS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR CONTRACTS HAVE SPECIFIC PROVISIONS RELATING TO COST, SCHEDULE AND PERFORMANCE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS ARE GENERALLY SUBJECT TO MORE UNCERTAINTY THAN FIXED-PRICE PRODUCTION CONTRACTS. MANY OF THESE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS HAVE HIGHLY COMPLEX DESIGNS. IN ADDITION, TECHNICAL OR QUALITY ISSUES THAT ARISE DURING DEVELOPMENT COULD LEAD TO SCHEDULE DELAYS AND HIGHER COSTS TO COMPLETE, WHICH COULD RESULT IN A MATERIAL CHARGE OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. EXAMPLES OF SIGNIFICANT BDS FIXED-PRICE DEVELOPMENT CONTRACTS INCLUDE

AEW&C

, INDIA P-8I, SAUDI F-15, USAF KC-46A TANKER, AND COMMERCIAL AND MILITARY SATELLITES.

WE ENTER INTO COST-TYPE CONTRACTS WHICH ALSO CARRY RISKS.

OUR BDS BUSINESS GENERATED APPROXIMATELY

30%

OF ITS

2013

REVENUES FROM COST-TYPE CONTRACTING ARRANGEMENTS. SOME OF THESE ARE DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS THAT HAVE COMPLEX DESIGN AND TECHNICAL CHALLENGES. THESE COST-TYPE PROGRAMS TYPICALLY HAVE AWARD OR INCENTIVE FEES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO UNCERTAINTY AND MAY BE EARNED OVER EXTENDED PERIODS. IN THESE CASES THE ASSOCIATED FINANCIAL RISKS ARE PRIMARILY IN REDUCED FEES, LOWER PROFIT RATES OR PROGRAM CANCELLATION IF COST, SCHEDULE OR TECHNICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUES ARISE. PROGRAMS WHOSE CONTRACTS ARE PRIMARILY COST-TYPE INCLUDE

GMD

, PROPRIETARY AND

SLS

PROGRAMS.

WE ENTER INTO CONTRACTS THAT INCLUDE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS THAT SUBJECT US TO RISKS.

CONTRACTS IN THE COMMERCIAL SATELLITE INDUSTRY AND CERTAIN GOVERNMENT SATELLITE CONTRACTS INCLUDE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENTS. THESE IN-ORBIT PAYMENTS MAY BE PAID OVER TIME AFTER FINAL SATELLITE ACCEPTANCE OR PAID IN FULL PRIOR TO FINAL SATELLITE ACCEPTANCE. IN BOTH CASES, THE IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE PAYMENT IS AT RISK IF THE SATELLITE DOES NOT PERFORM TO SPECIFICATIONS FOR UP TO 15 YEARS AFTER ACCEPTANCE. THE NET PRESENT VALUE OF IN-ORBIT INCENTIVE FEES WE ULTIMATELY EXPECT TO REALIZE IS RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE IN THE CONSTRUCTION PERIOD. IF THE SATELLITE FAILS TO MEET CONTRACTUAL PERFORMANCE CRITERIA, CUSTOMERS WILL NOT BE OBLIGATED TO CONTINUE MAKING IN-ORBIT PAYMENTS AND/OR WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO PROVIDE REFUNDS TO THE CUSTOMER AND INCUR SIGNIFICANT CHARGES.

OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT SATISFY CUSTOMER REQUIREMENTS IS HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON THE PERFORMANCE OF OUR SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS, AS WELL AS ON THE AVAILABILITY OF RAW MATERIALS AND OTHER COMPONENTS.

WE RELY ON OTHER COMPANIES INCLUDING SUBCONTRACTORS AND SUPPLIERS TO PROVIDE AND PRODUCE RAW MATERIALS, INTEGRATED COMPONENTS AND SUB-ASSEMBLIES, AND PRODUCTION COMMODITIES AND TO PERFORM SOME OF THE SERVICES THAT WE PROVIDE TO OUR CUSTOMERS. IF ONE OR MORE OF OUR SUPPLIERS OR SUBCONTRACTORS EXPERIENCES DELIVERY DELAYS OR OTHER PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO MEET COMMITMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OR INCUR ADDITIONAL COSTS. IN ADDITION, IF ONE OR MORE OF THE RAW MATERIALS ON WHICH WE DEPEND (SUCH AS ALUMINUM, TITANIUM OR COMPOSITES) BECOMES UNAVAILABLE OR IS AVAILABLE ONLY AT VERY HIGH PRICES, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO DELIVER ONE OR MORE OF OUR PRODUCTS IN A TIMELY FASHION OR AT BUDGETED COSTS. IN SOME INSTANCES, WE DEPEND UPON A SINGLE SOURCE OF SUPPLY. ANY SERVICE DISRUPTION FROM ONE OF THESE SUPPLIERS, EITHER DUE TO CIRCUMSTANCES BEYOND THE SUPPLIERS CONTROL OR AS A RESULT OF PERFORMANCE PROBLEMS OR FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES, COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR ABILITY TO MEET COMMITMENTS TO OUR CUSTOMERS OR INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS.

WE USE ESTIMATES IN ACCOUNTING FOR MANY CONTRACTS AND PROGRAMS. CHANGES IN OUR ESTIMATES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS.

CONTRACT AND PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRE JUDGMENT RELATIVE TO ASSESSING RISKS, ESTIMATING REVENUES AND COSTS AND MAKING ASSUMPTIONS FOR SCHEDULE AND TECHNICAL ISSUES. DUE TO THE SIZE AND NATURE OF MANY OF OUR CONTRACTS AND PROGRAMS, THE ESTIMATION OF TOTAL REVENUES AND COST AT COMPLETION IS COMPLICATED AND SUBJECT TO MANY VARIABLES. ASSUMPTIONS HAVE TO BE MADE REGARDING THE LENGTH OF TIME TO COMPLETE THE CONTRACT OR PROGRAM BECAUSE COSTS ALSO INCLUDE EXPECTED INCREASES IN WAGES AND EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, MATERIAL PRICES AND ALLOCATED FIXED COSTS. INCENTIVES OR PENALTIES RELATED TO PERFORMANCE ON CONTRACTS ARE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING SALES AND PROFIT RATES, AND ARE RECORDED WHEN THERE IS SUFFICIENT INFORMATION FOR US TO ASSESS ANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE. SUPPLIERS ASSERTIONS ARE ALSO ASSESSED AND CONSIDERED IN ESTIMATING COSTS AND PROFIT RATES. ESTIMATES OF AWARD FEES ARE ALSO USED IN SALES AND PROFIT RATES BASED ON ACTUAL AND ANTICIPATED AWARDS.

WITH RESPECT TO EACH OF OUR COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT PROGRAMS, INVENTORIABLE PRODUCTION COSTS (INCLUDING OVERHEAD), PROGRAM TOOLING AND OTHER NON-RECURRING COSTS AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS ARE ACCUMULATED AND CHARGED AS COST OF SALES BY PROGRAM INSTEAD OF BY INDIVIDUAL UNITS OR CONTRACTS. A PROGRAM CONSISTS OF THE ESTIMATED NUMBER OF UNITS (ACCOUNTING QUANTITY) OF A PRODUCT TO BE PRODUCED IN A CONTINUING, LONG-TERM PRODUCTION EFFORT FOR DELIVERY UNDER EXISTING AND ANTICIPATED CONTRACTS LIMITED BY THE ABILITY TO MAKE REASONABLY DEPENDABLE ESTIMATES. TO ESTABLISH THE RELATIONSHIP OF SALES TO COST OF SALES, PROGRAM ACCOUNTING REQUIRES ESTIMATES OF (A) THE NUMBER OF UNITS TO BE PRODUCED AND SOLD IN A PROGRAM, (B) THE PERIOD OVER WHICH THE UNITS CAN REASONABLY BE EXPECTED TO BE PRODUCED AND (C) THE UNITS EXPECTED SALES PRICES, PRODUCTION COSTS, PROGRAM TOOLING AND OTHER NON-RECURRING COSTS, AND ROUTINE WARRANTY COSTS FOR THE TOTAL PROGRAM. SEVERAL FACTORS DETERMINE ACCOUNTING QUANTITY, INCLUDING FIRM ORDERS, LETTERS OF INTENT FROM PROSPECTIVE CUSTOMERS AND MARKET STUDIES. CHANGES TO CUSTOMER OR MODEL MIX, PRODUCTION COSTS AND RATES, LEARNING CURVE, ESCALATION, COSTS OF DERIVATIVE AIRCRAFT, SUPPLIER PERFORMANCE, CUSTOMER NEGOTIATIONS/SETTLEMENTS, SUPPLIER CLAIMS AND/OR CERTIFICATION ISSUES CAN IMPACT THESE ESTIMATES. ANY SUCH CHANGE IN ESTIMATES RELATING TO PROGRAM ACCOUNTING MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

BECAUSE OF THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATION PROCESSES DESCRIBED ABOVE, MATERIALLY DIFFERENT SALES AND PROFIT AMOUNTS COULD BE RECORDED IF WE USED DIFFERENT ASSUMPTIONS OR IF THE UNDERLYING CIRCUMSTANCES WERE TO CHANGE. CHANGES IN UNDERLYING ASSUMPTIONS, CIRCUMSTANCES OR ESTIMATES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT FUTURE PERIOD FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE.

COMPETITION WITHIN OUR MARKETS MAY REDUCE OUR FUTURE CONTRACTS AND SALES.

THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE OPERATE ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND ONE OR MORE OF OUR COMPETITORS MAY HAVE MORE EXTENSIVE OR MORE SPECIALIZED ENGINEERING, MANUFACTURING AND MARKETING CAPABILITIES THAN WE DO IN SOME AREAS. IN OUR COMMERCIAL AIRPLANES BUSINESS, WE ANTICIPATE INCREASING COMPETITION AMONG NON-U.S. AIRCRAFT MANUFACTURERS AND SERVICE PROVIDERS IN ONE OR MORE OF OUR MARKET SEGMENTS. IN OUR BDS BUSINESS, WE ANTICIPATE THAT THE EFFECTS OF DEFENSE INDUSTRY CONSOLIDATION AND NEW PRIORITIES, INCLUDING LONG-TERM COST COMPETITIVENESS, OF OUR

U.S. DOD

CUSTOMER WILL INTENSIFY COMPETITION FOR MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. FURTHERMORE, WE ARE FACING INCREASED INTERNATIONAL COMPETITION AND CROSS-BORDER CONSOLIDATION OF COMPETITION. THERE CAN BE NO ASSURANCE THAT WE WILL BE ABLE TO COMPETE SUCCESSFULLY AGAINST OUR CURRENT OR FUTURE COMPETITORS OR THAT THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES WE FACE WILL NOT RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUES AND MARKET SHARE.

WE DERIVE A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FROM NON-U.S. SALES AND ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS IN OTHER COUNTRIES.

IN

2013

, NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY

57%

OF OUR REVENUES. WE EXPECT THAT NON-U.S. SALES WILL CONTINUE TO ACCOUNT FOR A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR REVENUES FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. AS A RESULT, WE ARE SUBJECT TO RISKS OF DOING BUSINESS INTERNATIONALLY, INCLUDING.



CHANGES IN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS;



DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENT POLICIES, INCLUDING REQUIREMENTS TO EXPEND A PORTION OF PROGRAM FUNDS LOCALLY AND GOVERNMENTAL INDUSTRIAL COOPERATION OR PARTICIPATION REQUIREMENTS;



FLUCTUATIONS IN INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES;

VOLATILITY IN INTERNATIONAL POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENTS AND CHANGES IN NON-U.S. NATIONAL PRIORITIES AND BUDGETS, WHICH CAN LEAD TO DELAYS OR FLUCTUATIONS IN ORDERS;



THE COMPLEXITY AND NECESSITY OF USING NON-U.S. REPRESENTATIVES AND CONSULTANTS;



THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE ABILITY OF NON-U.S. CUSTOMERS TO FINANCE PURCHASES, INCLUDING THE AVAILABILITY OF FINANCING FROM THE EXPORT-IMPORT BANK OF THE UNITED STATES;



UNCERTAINTIES AND RESTRICTIONS CONCERNING THE AVAILABILITY OF FUNDING CREDIT OR GUARANTEES;



IMPOSITION OF DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL TAXES, EXPORT CONTROLS, TARIFFS, EMBARGOES AND OTHER TRADE RESTRICTIONS;

COMPLIANCE WITH A VARIETY OF INTERNATIONAL LAWS, AS WELL AS U.S. LAWS AFFECTING THE ACTIVITIES OF U.S. COMPANIES ABROAD; AND



UNFORESEEN DEVELOPMENTS AND CONDITIONS, INCLUDING TERRORISM, WAR AND INTERNATIONAL CONFLICTS.

WHILE THE IMPACT OF THESE FACTORS IS DIFFICULT TO PREDICT, ANY ONE OR MORE OF THESE FACTORS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS IN THE FUTURE.

THE OUTCOME OF LITIGATION AND OF GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING OUR BUSINESS IS UNPREDICTABLE AND AN ADVERSE DECISION IN ANY SUCH MATTER COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE ARE INVOLVED IN A NUMBER OF LITIGATION MATTERS. THESE CLAIMS MAY DIVERT FINANCIAL AND MANAGEMENT RESOURCES THAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE USED TO BENEFIT OUR OPERATIONS. NO ASSURANCES CAN BE GIVEN THAT THE RESULTS OF THESE MATTERS WILL BE FAVORABLE TO US. AN ADVERSE RESOLUTION OF ANY OF THESE LAWSUITS COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. IN ADDITION, WE ARE SOMETIMES SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT INQUIRIES AND INVESTIGATIONS OF OUR BUSINESS DUE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, TO OUR BUSINESS RELATIONSHIPS WITH THE U.S. GOVERNMENT, THE HEAVILY REGULATED NATURE OF OUR INDUSTRY, AND IN THE CASE OF ENVIRONMENTAL PROCEEDINGS, OUR OWNERSHIP OF CERTAIN PROPERTY. ANY SUCH INQUIRY OR INVESTIGATION COULD POTENTIALLY RESULT IN AN ADVERSE RULING AGAINST US, WHICH COULD HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION AND OPERATING RESULTS.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CUSTOMER FINANCING PORTFOLIO IS CONCENTRATED AMONG CERTAIN CUSTOMERS BASED IN THE UNITED STATES, AND IN CERTAIN TYPES OF BOEING AIRCRAFT, WHICH EXPOSES US TO CONCENTRATION RISKS.

A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR CUSTOMER FINANCING PORTFOLIO IS CONCENTRATED AMONG CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AND IN DISTINCT GEOGRAPHIC REGIONS, PARTICULARLY IN THE UNITED STATES. OUR PORTFOLIO IS ALSO CONCENTRATED BY VARYING DEGREES ACROSS BOEING AIRCRAFT PRODUCT TYPES, MOST NOTABLY 717 AIRCRAFT. IF ONE OR MORE CUSTOMERS HOLDING A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO ASSETS EXPERIENCES FINANCIAL DIFFICULTIES OR OTHERWISE DEFAULTS ON OR DOES NOT RENEW ITS LEASES WITH US AT THEIR EXPIRATION, AND WE ARE UNABLE TO REDEPLOY THE AIRCRAFT ON REASONABLE TERMS, OR IF THE TYPES OF AIRCRAFT THAT ARE CONCENTRATED IN OUR PORTFOLIO SUFFER GREATER THAN EXPECTED DECLINES IN VALUE, OUR EARNINGS, CASH FLOWS AND/OR FINANCIAL POSITION COULD BE MATERIALLY ADVERSELY AFFECTED.

WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN DEBT TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS AT COMPETITIVE RATES, ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS OR IN SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS.

WE DEPEND, IN PART, UPON THE ISSUANCE OF DEBT TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS. AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013 AND 2012

, OUR AIRPLANE FINANCING COMMITMENTS TOTALED

$17,987 MILLION

AND

$18,083 MILLION

. IF WE REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FUNDING IN ORDER TO FUND OUTSTANDING FINANCING COMMITMENTS OR MEET OTHER BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS, OUR MARKET LIQUIDITY MAY NOT BE SUFFICIENT. A NUMBER OF FACTORS COULD CAUSE US TO INCUR INCREASED BORROWING COSTS AND TO HAVE GREATER DIFFICULTY ACCESSING PUBLIC AND PRIVATE MARKETS FOR

12

TABLE OF CONTENTS

DEBT. THESE FACTORS INCLUDE DISRUPTIONS OR DECLINES IN THE GLOBAL CAPITAL MARKETS AND/OR A DECLINE IN OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, OUTLOOK OR CREDIT RATINGS. THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY OR ALL OF THESE EVENTS MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO FUND OUR OPERATIONS AND CONTRACTUAL OR FINANCING COMMITMENTS.

WE MAY NOT REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS OF MERGERS, ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES/STRATEGIC ALLIANCES OR DIVESTITURES.

AS PART OF OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, WE MAY MERGE WITH OR ACQUIRE BUSINESSES AND/OR FORM JOINT VENTURES AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES. WHETHER WE REALIZE THE ANTICIPATED BENEFITS FROM THESE ACQUISITIONS AND RELATED ACTIVITIES DEPENDS, IN PART, UPON OUR ABILITY TO INTEGRATE THE OPERATIONS OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS, THE PERFORMANCE OF THE UNDERLYING PRODUCT AND SERVICE PORTFOLIO, AND THE PERFORMANCE OF THE MANAGEMENT TEAM AND OTHER PERSONNEL OF THE ACQUIRED OPERATIONS. ACCORDINGLY, OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS COULD BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED FROM UNANTICIPATED PERFORMANCE ISSUES, LEGACY LIABILITIES, TRANSACTION-RELATED CHARGES, AMORTIZATION OF EXPENSES RELATED TO INTANGIBLES, CHARGES FOR IMPAIRMENT OF LONG-TERM ASSETS, CREDIT GUARANTEES, PARTNER PERFORMANCE AND INDEMNIFICATIONS. CONSOLIDATIONS OF JOINT VENTURES COULD ALSO IMPACT OUR REPORTED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL POSITION. WHILE WE BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE ESTABLISHED APPROPRIATE AND ADEQUATE PROCEDURES AND PROCESSES TO MITIGATE THESE RISKS, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT THESE TRANSACTIONS WILL BE SUCCESSFUL. WE ALSO MAY MAKE STRATEGIC DIVESTITURES FROM TIME TO TIME. THESE TRANSACTIONS MAY RESULT IN CONTINUED FINANCIAL INVOLVEMENT IN THE DIVESTED BUSINESSES, SUCH AS THROUGH GUARANTEES OR OTHER FINANCIAL ARRANGEMENTS, FOLLOWING THE TRANSACTION. NONPERFORMANCE BY THOSE DIVESTED BUSINESSES COULD AFFECT OUR FUTURE FINANCIAL RESULTS THROUGH ADDITIONAL PAYMENT OBLIGATIONS, HIGHER COSTS OR ASSET WRITE-DOWNS.

OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER ALL SIGNIFICANT RISK EXPOSURES.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO LIABILITIES THAT ARE UNIQUE TO THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE PROVIDE. WE MAINTAIN INSURANCE FOR CERTAIN RISKS AND, IN SOME CIRCUMSTANCES, WE MAY RECEIVE INDEMNIFICATION FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT. THE AMOUNT OF OUR INSURANCE COVERAGE MAY NOT COVER ALL CLAIMS OR LIABILITIES AND WE MAY BE FORCED TO BEAR SUBSTANTIAL COSTS. FOR EXAMPLE, LIABILITIES ARISING FROM THE USE OF CERTAIN OF OUR PRODUCTS, SUCH AS AIRCRAFT TECHNOLOGIES, MISSILE SYSTEMS, BORDER SECURITY SYSTEMS, ANTI-TERRORISM TECHNOLOGIES, AND/OR AIR TRAFFIC MANAGEMENT SYSTEMS MAY NOT BE INSURABLE ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. WHILE SOME OF THESE PRODUCTS ARE SHIELDED FROM LIABILITY WITHIN THE U.S. UNDER THE SAFETY ACT PROVISIONS OF THE 2002 HOMELAND SECURITY ACT, NO SUCH PROTECTION IS AVAILABLE OUTSIDE THE U.S., POTENTIALLY RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT LIABILITIES. THE AMOUNT OF INSURANCE COVERAGE WE MAINTAIN MAY BE INADEQUATE TO COVER THESE OR OTHER CLAIMS OR LIABILITIES.

BUSINESS DISRUPTIONS COULD SERIOUSLY AFFECT OUR FUTURE SALES AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OR INCREASE OUR COSTS AND EXPENSES.

OUR BUSINESS MAY BE IMPACTED BY DISRUPTIONS INCLUDING THREATS TO PHYSICAL SECURITY, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY OR CYBER-ATTACKS OR FAILURES, DAMAGING WEATHER OR OTHER ACTS OF NATURE AND PANDEMICS OR OTHER PUBLIC HEALTH CRISES. ANY OF THESE DISRUPTIONS COULD AFFECT OUR INTERNAL OPERATIONS OR OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS. ANY SIGNIFICANT PRODUCTION DELAYS, OR ANY DESTRUCTION, MANIPULATION OR IMPROPER USE OF OUR DATA, INFORMATION SYSTEMS OR NETWORKS COULD IMPACT OUR SALES, INCREASE OUR EXPENSES AND/OR HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON THE REPUTATION OF BOEING AND OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

SOME OF OUR AND OUR SUPPLIERS WORKFORCES ARE REPRESENTED BY LABOR UNIONS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO WORK STOPPAGES.

APPROXIMATELY

65,000

EMPLOYEES, WHICH CONSTITUTE

38%

OF OUR TOTAL WORKFORCE, ARE UNION REPRESENTED AS OF

DECEMBER 31, 2013

. WE EXPERIENCED A WORK STOPPAGE IN 2008 WHEN A LABOR STRIKE HALTED COMMERCIAL AIRCRAFT AND CERTAIN BMA PROGRAM PRODUCTION. WE MAY EXPERIENCE ADDITIONAL WORK STOPPAGES IN THE FUTURE, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. WE CANNOT PREDICT HOW STABLE OUR RELATIONSHIPS, CURRENTLY WITH

NON-U.S. LABOR ORGANIZATIONS, WILL BE OR WHETHER WE WILL BE ABLE TO MEET THE UNIONS REQUIREMENTS WITHOUT IMPACTING OUR FINANCIAL CONDITION. THE UNIONS MAY ALSO LIMIT OUR FLEXIBILITY IN DEALING WITH OUR WORKFORCE. UNION ACTIONS AT SUPPLIERS CAN ALSO AFFECT US. WORK STOPPAGES AND INSTABILITY IN OUR UNION RELATIONSHIPS COULD DELAY THE PRODUCTION AND/OR DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD STRAIN RELATIONSHIPS WITH CUSTOMERS AND CAUSE A LOSS OF REVENUES WHICH WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS.

FUNDED STATUS. THE EXTENT OF FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS DEPENDS HEAVILY ON MARKET FACTORS SUCH AS THE DISCOUNT RATE AND THE ACTUAL RETURN ON PLAN ASSETS. WE ESTIMATE FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS TO THESE PLANS USING ASSUMPTIONS WITH RESPECT TO THESE AND OTHER ITEMS. CHANGES TO THOSE ASSUMPTIONS

COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON FUTURE CONTRIBUTIONS AS WELL AS ON OUR ANNUAL PENSION COSTS AND/OR RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE TO SHAREHOLDERS

'

EQUITY. FOR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS, WE ALLOCATE PENSION COSTS TO INDIVIDUAL CONTRACTS BASED ON U.S. COST ACCOUNTING STANDARDS WHICH CAN ALSO AFFECT CONTRACT PROFITABILITY. WE ALSO PROVIDE OTHER POSTRETIREMENT BENEFITS TO CERTAIN OF OUR EMPLOYEES, CONSISTING PRINCIPALLY OF HEALTH CARE COVERAGE FOR ELIGIBLE RETIREES AND QUALIFYING DEPENDENTS. OUR ESTIMATES OF FUTURE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE BENEFITS ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO ASSUMPTIONS, INCLUDING ESTIMATES OF THE LEVEL OF MEDICAL COST INCREASES.

OUR OPERATIONS EXPOSE US TO THE RISK OF MATERIAL ENVIRONMENTAL LIABILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS FEDERAL, STATE, LOCAL AND NON-U.S. LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATED TO ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION, INCLUDING THE DISCHARGE, TREATMENT, STORAGE, DISPOSAL AND REMEDIATION OF HAZARDOUS SUBSTANCES AND WASTES.
