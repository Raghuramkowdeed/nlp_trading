K FACTORS

OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION ACROSS ALL MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH MAY LEAD TO LOWER REVENUE OR OPERATING MARGINS.

COMPETITION IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR

OUR COMPETITORS RANGE IN SIZE FROM DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL COMPANIES WITH SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO SMALL, SPECIALIZED FIRMS WHOSE NARROWER PRODUCT LINES MAY LET THEM BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEPLOYING TECHNICAL, MARKETING, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN MANY OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE LOW AND MANY OF THE AREAS IN WHICH WE COMPETE EVOLVE RAPIDLY WITH CHANGING AND DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, SHIFTING USER NEEDS, AND FREQUENT INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE DEPENDS ON OUR SUCCESS IN MAKING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, DEVICES, AND SERVICES THAT APPEAL TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS.

COMPETITION AMONG PLATFORMS, ECOSYSTEMS, AND DEVICES

AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN TO CREATE PLATFORM-BASED ECOSYSTEMS ON WHICH MANY PARTICIPANTS CAN BUILD DIVERSE SOLUTIONS. A WELL-ESTABLISHED ECOSYSTEM CREATES BENEFICIAL NETWORK EFFECTS AMONG USERS, APPLICATION DEVELOPERS, AND THE PLATFORM PROVIDER THAT CAN ACCELERATE GROWTH. ESTABLISHING SIGNIFICANT SCALE IN THE MARKETPLACE IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN ATTRACTIVE MARGINS. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM FIRMS THAT PROVIDE COMPETING PLATFORMS, APPLICATIONS, AND SERVICES.



A COMPETING VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED MODEL, IN WHICH A SINGLE FIRM CONTROLS THE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ELEMENTS OF A PRODUCT AND RELATED SERVICES, HAS SUCCEEDED WITH SOME CONSUMER PRODUCTS SUCH AS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, TABLETS, PHONES, GAMING CONSOLES, AND WEARABLES. COMPETITORS PURSUING THIS MODEL ALSO EARN REVENUE FROM SERVICES INTEGRATED WITH THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLATFORM. WE ALSO OFFER SOME VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. TO THE EXTENT WE SHIFT A PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS TO A VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MODEL WE INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE AND REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.



WE DERIVE SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE FROM LICENSES OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS ON PERSONAL COMPUTERS. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM COMPETING PLATFORMS DEVELOPED FOR NEW DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS SUCH AS SMARTPHONES AND TABLET COMPUTERS. THESE DEVICES COMPETE ON MULTIPLE BASES INCLUDING PRICE AND THE PERCEIVED UTILITY OF THE DEVICE AND ITS PLATFORM. USERS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO THESE DEVICES TO PERFORM FUNCTIONS THAT IN THE PAST WERE PERFORMED BY PERSONAL COMPUTERS. EVEN IF MANY USERS VIEW THESE DEVICES AS COMPLEMENTARY TO A PERSONAL COMPUTER, THE PREVALENCE OF THESE DEVICES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT APPLICATION DEVELOPERS TO OUR PC OPERATING SYSTEM PLATFORMS. COMPETING WITH OPERATING SYSTEMS LICENSED AT LOW OR NO COST MAY DECREASE OUR PC OPERATING SYSTEM MARGINS. IN ADDITION, SOME OF OUR DEVICES COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS MADE BY OUR OEM PARTNERS, WHICH MAY AFFECT THEIR COMMITMENT TO OUR PLATFORM.



COMPETING PLATFORMS HAVE CONTENT AND APPLICATION MARKETPLACES WITH SCALE AND SIGNIFICANT INSTALLED BASES. THE VARIETY AND UTILITY OF CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE ON A PLATFORM ARE IMPORTANT TO DEVICE PURCHASING DECISIONS. USERS SOMETIMES INCUR COSTS TO MOVE DATA AND BUY NEW CONTENT AND APPLICATIONS WHEN SWITCHING PLATFORMS. TO COMPETE, WE MUST SUCCESSFULLY ENLIST DEVELOPERS TO WRITE APPLICATIONS FOR OUR MARKETPLACE AND ENSURE THAT THESE APPLICATIONS HAVE HIGH QUALITY, CUSTOMER APPEAL, AND VALUE. EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH COMPETITORS CONTENT AND APPLICATION MARKETPLACES MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE AND LOWER OUR OPERATING MARGINS.

BUSINESS MODEL COMPETITION

COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US BASED ON A GROWING VARIETY OF BUSINESS MODELS.



EVEN AS WE TRANSITION MORE OF OUR BUSINESS TO A SERVICES AND SUBSCRIPTION BUSINESS MODEL, THE LICENSE-BASED PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE MODEL GENERATES MOST OF OUR SOFTWARE REVENUE. WE BEAR THE COSTS OF CONVERTING ORIGINAL IDEAS INTO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OFFSETTING THESE COSTS WITH THE REVENUE RECEIVED FROM LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS ALSO DEVELOP AND SELL SOFTWARE TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS UNDER THIS MODEL.

ITEM 1A



OTHER COMPETITORS DEVELOP AND OFFER FREE APPLICATIONS, ONLINE SERVICES AND CONTENT, AND MAKE MONEY BY SELLING THIRD-PARTY ADVE

RTISING. ADVERTISING REVENUE FUNDS DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THESE COMPETITORS PROVIDE TO USERS AT NO OR LITTLE COST, COMPETING DIRECTLY WITH OUR REVENUE-GENERATING PRODUCTS.



SOME COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US USING AN OPEN SOURCE BUSINESS MODEL BY MODIFYING AND THEN DISTRIBUTING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AT NOMINAL COST TO END-USERS, AND EARNING REVENUE ON ADVERTISING OR COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. THESE FIRMS DO NOT BEAR THE FULL COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE SOFTWARE. SOME OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE VENDORS DEVELOP SOFTWARE THAT MIMICS THE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS.

THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY CAUSE DECREASED SALES VOLUMES, PRICE REDUCTIONS, AND/OR INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, SUCH AS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, AND SALES INCENTIVES. THIS MAY LEAD TO LOWER REVENUE, GROSS MARGINS, AND OPERATING INCOME.

OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON SERVICES PRESENTS EXECUTION AND COMPETITIVE RISKS.

A GROWING PART OF OUR BUSINESS INVOLVES CLOUD-BASED SERVICES AVAILABLE ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF COMPUTING DEVICES. OUR STRATEGIC VISION IS TO COMPETE AND GROW BY BUILDING BEST-IN-CLASS PLATFORMS AND PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES FOR AN INTELLIGENT CLOUD AND AN INTELLIGENT EDGE INFUSED WITH AI. AT THE SAME TIME, OUR COMPETITORS ARE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. PRICING AND DELIVERY MODELS ARE EVOLVING. DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS INFLUENCE HOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD AND SOMETIMES THE USERS CHOICE OF WHICH SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO USE. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY OUR CLOUD-BASED STRATEGIES. THE WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM MUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE WITH THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. WE ARE UNDERTAKING CULTURAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES TO DRIVE ACCOUNTABILITY AND ELIMINATE OBSTACLES TO INNOVATION. THE COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN GAINING INSIGHTS FROM DATA IS BECOMING CENTRAL TO THE VALUE OF THE SERVICES WE DELIVER TO CUSTOMERS, TO OUR OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY AND KEY OPPORTUNITIES IN MONETIZATION, CUSTOMER PERCEPTIONS OF QUALITY, AND OPERATIONAL EFFICIENCY. OUR ABILITY TO USE DATA IN THIS WAY MAY BE CONSTRAINED BY REGULATORY DEVELOPMENTS THAT IMPEDE REALIZING THE EXPECTED RETURN FROM THIS INVESTMENT.

BESIDES SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS, WE ARE INCURRING COSTS TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES. THESE COSTS WILL REDUCE THE OPERATING MARGINS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY ACHIEVED. WHETHER WE SUCCEED IN CLOUD-BASED SERVICES DEPENDS ON OUR EXECUTION IN SEVERAL AREAS, INCLUDING.



CONTINUING TO BRING TO MARKET COMPELLING CLOUD-BASED EXPERIENCES THAT GENERATE INCREASING TRAFFIC AND MARKET SHARE.



MAINTAINING THE UTILITY, COMPATIBILITY, AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ON THE GROWING ARRAY OF COMPUTING DEVICES, INCLUDING PCS, SMARTPHONES, TABLETS, GAMING CONSOLES, AND OTHER TELEVISION-RELATED DEVICES.



CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR CLOUD PLATFORMS TO THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS.



ENSURING OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES MEET THE RELIABILITY EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF THEIR DATA.



MAKING OUR SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES PLATFORM-AGNOSTIC, AVAILABLE ON A WIDE RANGE OF DEVICES AND ECOSYSTEMS, INCLUDING THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS.

IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER OUR STRATEGIES WILL ATTRACT THE USERS OR GENERATE THE REVENUE REQUIRED TO SUCCEED. IF WE ARE NOT EFFECTIVE IN EXECUTING ORGANIZATIONAL AND TECHNICAL CHANGES TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND ACCELERATE INNOVATION, OR IF WE FAIL TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT USAGE OF OUR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE MAY NOT GROW REVENUE IN LINE WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT INVESTMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THIS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT GROSS MARGINS AND OPERATING INCOME.

WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT MAY NOT ACHIEVE EXPECTED RETURNS.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM, THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, BING, WINDOWS SERVER, THE WINDOWS STORE, THE MICROSOFT AZURE SERVICES PLATFORM, OFFICE 365, OTHER CLOUD-BASED OFFERINGS, AND THE XBOX ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM. WE ALSO INVEST IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION OF A VARIETY OF HARDWARE FOR PRODUCTIVITY, COMMUNICATION, AND ENTERTAINMENT INCLUDING PCS, TABLETS, GAMING DEVICES, AND HOLOLENS. INVESTMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGY ARE SPECULATIVE. COMMERCIAL SUCCESS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING INNOVATIVENESS, DEVELOPER SUPPORT, AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING. IF CUSTOMERS DO NOT PERCEIVE OUR LATEST OFFERINGS AS PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNCTIONALITY OR OTHER VALUE, THEY MAY REDUCE THEIR PURCHASES OF NEW SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES, UNFAVORABLY AFFECTING REVENUE. WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM NEW PRODUCT, SERVICE, AND

DISTR

IBUTION CHANNEL INVESTMENTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS, IF AT ALL. NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE, AND EVEN IF THEY ARE PROFITABLE, OPERATING MARGINS FOR SOME NEW PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES WILL NOT BE AS HIGH AS THE MARGINS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTOR

ICALLY.

WE DID EXTENSIVE PREPARATION AND ONGOING COMPATIBILITY TESTING FOR APPLICATIONS AND DEVICES TO HELP ENSURE A POSITIVE EXPERIENCE FOR OUR USERS INSTALLING WINDOWS 10. HOWEVER, NEGATIVE UPGRADE EXPERIENCES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT THE RECEPTION OF WINDOWS 10 IN THE MARKETPLACE AND COULD LEAD TO LITIGATION OR REGULATORY ACTIONS BY CUSTOMERS AND GOVERNMENT AGENCIES. IN ADDITION, WE ANTICIPATE THAT WINDOWS 10 WILL ENABLE NEW POST-LICENSE MONETIZATION OPPORTUNITIES BEYOND INITIAL LICENSE REVENUES. OUR INABILITY TO REALIZE THESE OPPORTUNITIES TO THE EXTENT WE EXPECT COULD HAVE AN ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR REVENUES. FINALLY, OUR PRACTICES FOR DATA COLLECTION, USE, AND MANAGEMENT IN WINDOWS 10 ARE SUBJECT TO REGULATORY REVIEW, AND MAY RESULT IN DECISIONS DIRECTING US TO CHANGE THESE PRACTICES AND IMPOSING FINES. IF SO, WE COULD FACE NEGATIVE PUBLIC REACTION, DEGRADED USER EXPERIENCES, AND REDUCED FLEXIBILITY IN PRODUCT DESIGN.

DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS COMPLEX. IT CAN REQUIRE LONG DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PERIODS. SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN NEW RELEASES OR SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN CREATING NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE MAKING ACQUISITIONS AND ENTERING INTO JOINT VENTURES AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AS PART OF OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS STRATEGY. IN DECEMBER 2016, WE COMPLETED OUR ACQUISITION OF LINKEDIN FOR $27.0 BILLION. THE LINKEDIN ACQUISITION AND OTHER TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS, INCLUDING THAT THEY DO NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, THAT WE GET AN UNSATISFACTORY RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT, THAT WE HAVE DIFFICULTY INTEGRATING AND RETAINING NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY, OR THAT THEY DISTRACT MANAGEMENT FROM OUR OTHER BUSINESSES. IF AN ARRANGEMENT FAILS TO ADEQUATELY ANTICIPATE CHANGING CIRCUMSTANCES AND INTERESTS OF A PARTY, IT MAY RESULT IN EARLY TERMINATION OR RENEGOTIATION OF THE ARRANGEMENT. THE SUCCESS OF THESE TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THEM TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR DEVELOP COMPELLING NEW ONES. IT MAY TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE FULL BENEFITS FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS AND ARRANGEMENTS, SUCH AS INCREASED REVENUE, ENHANCED EFFICIENCIES, OR INCREASED MARKET SHARE, OR THE BENEFITS MAY ULTIMATELY BE SMALLER THAN WE EXPECTED. THESE EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME IMPAIRED, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO EARNINGS.

WE ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND MAY NOT REALIZE ALL THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT FROM THOSE ACQUISITIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLES. WE REVIEW OUR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. FACTORS THAT MAY BE A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES, INDICATING THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, INCLUDE A DECLINE IN OUR STOCK PRICE AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION, REDUCED FUTURE CASH FLOW ESTIMATES, AND SLOWER GROWTH RATES IN INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE PARTICIPATE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH ANY IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS DETERMINED, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2015, WE RECORDED A $5.1 BILLION CHARGE FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL AND A $2.2 BILLION CHARGE FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2016 WE RECORDED A $480 MILLION CHARGE FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS. THE IMPAIRMENT CHARGES FOR BOTH PERIODS RELATED TO OUR PHONE BUSINESS. OUR ACQUISITION OF LINKEDIN RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN OUR GOODWILL AND INTANGIBLE ASSET BALANCES.

WE MAY NOT EARN THE REVENUES WE EXPECT FROM OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

PROTECTING OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND COMBATING UNLICENSED COPYING AND USE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY ON A GLOBAL BASIS IS DIFFICULT. WHILE PIRACY ADVERSELY AFFECTS U.S. REVENUE, THE IMPACT ON REVENUE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS MORE SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE LAWS ARE LESS PROTECTIVE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OUR REVENUE IN THESE MARKETS MAY GROW SLOWER THAN THE UNDERLYING DEVICE MARKET. SIMILARLY, THE ABSENCE OF HARMONIZED PATENT LAWS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENSURE CONSISTENT RESPECT FOR PATENT RIGHTS. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WE EDUCATE USERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF LICENSING GENUINE PRODUCTS AND OBTAINING INDEMNIFICATION BENEFITS FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS, AND WE EDUCATE LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF A BUSINESS CLIMATE WHERE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. REDUCTIONS IN THE LEGAL PROTECTION FOR SOFTWARE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUE.

19

ITEM 1A

WE MAY NOT RECEIVE EXPECTED ROYALTIES FROM OUR PATENT LICENSES

WE EXPEND SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO PATENT THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY WE CREATE WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT WE WILL GENERATE REVENUES BY INCORPORATING THAT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IN OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES OR, IN SOME INSTANCES, BY LICENSING OUR PATENTS TO OTHERS IN RETURN FOR A ROYALTY. CHANGES IN THE LAW MAY WEAKEN OUR ABILITY TO PREVENT THE USE OF PATENTED TECHNOLOGY OR COLLECT REVENUE FOR LICENSING OUR PATENTS. THESE INCLUDE LEGISLATIVE CHANGES AND REGULATORY ACTIONS THAT MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO OBTAIN INJUNCTIONS, AND THE INCREASING USE OF LEGAL PROCESS TO CHALLENGE ISSUED PATENTS. SIMILARLY, LICENSEES OF OUR PATENTS MAY FAIL TO SATISFY THEIR OBLIGATIONS TO PAY US ROYALTIES, OR MAY CONTEST THE SCOPE AND EXTENT OF THEIR OBLIGATIONS. FINALLY, THE ROYALTIES WE CAN OBTAIN TO MONETIZE OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY MAY DECLINE BECAUSE OF THE EVOLUTION OF TECHNOLOGY, SELLING PRICE CHANGES IN PRODUCTS USING LICENSED PATENTS, OR THE DIFFICULTY OF DISCOVERING INFRINGEMENTS.

THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, OTHERS CLAIM WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE NUMBER OF THESE CLAIMS MAY GROW BECAUSE OF CONSTANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE, THE EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES, THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, AND OUR OFFERING OF FIRST-PARTY DEVICES, SUCH AS SURFACE AND LUMIA PHONES. TO RESOLVE THESE CLAIMS, WE MAY ENTER INTO ROYALTY AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, STOP SELLING OR REDESIGN AFFECTED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR PAY DAMAGES TO SATISFY INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE OUTCOMES MAY CAUSE OPERATING MARGINS TO DECLINE. BESIDES MONEY DAMAGES, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS PLAINTIFFS CAN SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT MAY LIMIT OR PREVENT IMPORTING, MARKETING, AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT HAVE INFRINGING TECHNOLOGIES. IN SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS GERMANY, AN INJUNCTION CAN BE ISSUED BEFORE THE PARTIES HAVE FULLY LITIGATED THE VALIDITY OF THE UNDERLYING PATENTS. WE HAVE PAID SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS TO SETTLE CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND TO PROCURE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO MANAGE THIS RISK, AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR SOURCE CODE FROM COPYING IF THERE IS AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE CODE.

SOURCE CODE, THE DETAILED PROGRAM COMMANDS FOR OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND OTHER SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH WE LICENSE PORTIONS OF OUR APPLICATION AND OPERATING SYSTEM SOURCE CODE TO SEVERAL LICENSEES, WE TAKE SIGNIFICANT MEASURES TO PROTECT THE SECRECY OF LARGE PORTIONS OF OUR SOURCE CODE. IF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SOURCE CODE LEAKS, WE MIGHT LOSE FUTURE TRADE SECRET PROTECTION FOR THAT SOURCE CODE. IT MAY BECOME EASIER FOR THIRD PARTIES TO COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS BY COPYING FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE CODE ALSO COULD INCREASE THE SECURITY RISKS DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

CYBER-ATTACKS AND SECURITY VULNERABILITIES COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUE, INCREASED COSTS, LIABILITY CLAIMS, OR HARM TO OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

SECURITY OF MICROSOFTS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

THREATS TO IT SECURITY CAN TAKE A VARIETY OF FORMS. INDIVIDUAL AND GROUPS OF HACKERS AND SOPHISTICATED ORGANIZATIONS, INCLUDING STATE-SPONSORED ORGANIZATIONS OR NATION-STATES, CONTINUOUSLY UNDERTAKE ATTACKS THAT POSE THREATS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR IT. THESE ACTORS MAY USE A WIDE VARIETY OF METHODS, WHICH MAY INCLUDE DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING MALICIOUS SOFTWARE TO ATTACK OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORKS AND DATACENTERS, USING SOCIAL ENGINEERING TECHNIQUES TO INDUCE OUR EMPLOYEES, USERS, PARTNERS, OR CUSTOMERS TO DISCLOSE PASSWORDS OR OTHER SENSITIVE INFORMATION OR TAKE OTHER ACTIONS TO GAIN ACCESS TO OUR DATA OR OUR USERS OR CUSTOMERS DATA, OR ACTING IN A COORDINATED MANNER TO LAUNCH DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE OR OTHER COORDINATED ATTACKS. CYBER THREATS ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING, INCREASING THE DIFFICULTY OF DETECTING AND SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDING AGAINST THEM. CYBER THREATS CAN HAVE CASCADING IMPACTS THAT UNFOLD WITH INCREASING SPEED ACROSS OUR INTERNAL NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF OUR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS. BREACHES OF OUR NETWORK OR DATA SECURITY COULD DISRUPT THE SECURITY OF OUR INTERNAL SYSTEMS AND BUSINESS APPLICATIONS, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THEIR DATA, RESULT IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DELAYS, COMPROMISE CONFIDENTIAL OR TECHNICAL BUSINESS INFORMATION HARMING OUR REPUTATION OR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULT IN THEFT OR MISUSE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER ASSETS, REQUIRE US TO ALLOCATE MORE RESOURCES TO IMPROVED TECHNOLOGIES, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION, OUR INTERNAL IT ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. OFTEN, WE ARE EARLY ADOPTERS OF NEW DEVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES. WE EMBRACE NEW WAYS OF SHARING DATA AND COMMUNICATING INTERNALLY AND WITH PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS USING METHODS SUCH AS SOCIAL NETWORKING AND OTHER CONSUMER-ORIENTED TECHNOLOGIES. OUR BUSINESS POLICIES AND INTERNAL SECURITY CONTROLS MAY NOT KEEP PACE WITH THESE CHANGES AS NEW THREATS EMERGE.

ITEM 1A

SECURITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, DEVICES, AND CUSTOMERS DATA

THE SECURITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS IMPORTANT IN OUR CUSTOMERS DECISIONS TO PURCHASE OR USE OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. SECURITY THREATS ARE A CHALLENGE TO COMPANIES LIKE US WHOSE BUSINESS IS TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THREATS TO OUR OWN IT INFRASTRUCTURE CAN ALSO AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS USING OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES RELY ON THE SECURITY OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENSURE THE RELIABILITY OF OUR SERVICES AND THE PROTECTION OF THEIR DATA. HACKERS TEND TO FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON THE MOST POPULAR OPERATING SYSTEMS, PROGRAMS, AND SERVICES, INCLUDING MANY OF OURS, AND WE EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE. HACKERS THAT ACQUIRE USER ACCOUNT INFORMATION AT OTHER COMPANIES CAN USE THAT INFORMATION TO COMPROMISE OUR USERS ACCOUNTS WHERE ACCOUNTS SHARE THE SAME ATTRIBUTES LIKE PASSWORDS.

TO DEFEND AGAINST SECURITY THREATS, BOTH TO OUR INTERNAL IT SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY ENGINEER MORE SECURE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ENHANCE SECURITY AND RELIABILITY FEATURES, IMPROVE THE DEPLOYMENT OF SOFTWARE UPDATES TO ADDRESS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES, DEVELOP MITIGATION TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP TO SECURE CUSTOMERS FROM ATTACKS EVEN WHEN SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE NOT DEPLOYED, MAINTAIN THE DIGITAL SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROTECTS THE INTEGRITY OF OUR NETWORK, PRODUCTS, AND SERVICES, AND PROVIDE CUSTOMERS SECURITY TOOLS SUCH AS FIREWALLS AND ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE.

THE COST OF THESE STEPS COULD REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS. IF WE FAIL TO DO THESE THINGS WELL, ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION AND LEAD CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE OR DELAY FUTURE PURCHASES OF PRODUCTS OR SUBSCRIPTIONS TO SERVICES, OR TO USE COMPETING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO SPEND MORE ON PROTECTING THEIR EXISTING COMPUTER SYSTEMS FROM ATTACK, WHICH COULD DELAY ADOPTION OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. CUSTOMERS MAY FAIL TO UPDATE THEIR SYSTEMS, CONTINUE TO RUN SOFTWARE OR OPERATING SYSTEMS WE NO LONGER SUPPORT, OR MAY FAIL TIMELY TO INSTALL SECURITY PATCHES. ANY OF THESE ACTIONS BY CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED VULNERABILITIES MAY LEAD TO CLAIMS AGAINST US. ALTHOUGH OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE OR LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO LIABILITY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THESE PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND LEGAL CHALLENGES. LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION IN THESE AREAS MAY INCREASE THE COSTS TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT, OR SECURE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY AND HARM OUR REPUTATION.

AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW THE NUMBER AND SCALE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED OFFERINGS, WE STORE AND PROCESS INCREASINGLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THE CONTINUED OCCURRENCE OF HIGH-PROFILE DATA BREACHES PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF AN EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO INFORMATION SECURITY. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE SECURITY CONTROLS ACROSS OUR BUSINESS GROUPS AND GEOGRAPHIES, IT IS POSSIBLE OUR SECURITY CONTROLS OVER PERSONAL DATA, OUR TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES AND VENDORS ON DATA SECURITY, AND OTHER PRACTICES WE FOLLOW MAY NOT PREVENT THE IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF CUSTOMER DATA WE OR OUR VENDORS STORE AND MANAGE. IMPROPER DISCLOSURE COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION, LEAD TO LEGAL EXPOSURE TO CUSTOMERS, OR SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY UNDER LAWS THAT PROTECT PERSONAL DATA, RESULTING IN INCREASED COSTS OR LOSS OF REVENUE. OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALSO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO STORE AND PROCESS PERSONAL DATA ON-PREMISES OR, INCREASINGLY, IN A CLOUD-BASED ENVIRONMENT WE HOST. GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES CAN SOMETIMES REQUIRE US TO PRODUCE CUSTOMER DATA IN RESPONSE TO VALID LEGAL ORDERS. IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE, WE ADVOCATE FOR TRANSPARENCY CONCERNING THESE REQUESTS AND APPROPRIATE LIMITATIONS ON GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY TO COMPEL DISCLOSURE. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT CUSTOMER DATA, PERCEPTIONS THAT THE COLLECTION, USE, AND RETENTION OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IS NOT SATISFACTORILY PROTECTED COULD INHIBIT SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND COULD LIMIT ADOPTION OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS BY CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES, AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES WE MAY TAKE TO ADDRESS CUSTOMER CONCERNS, OR CONSTRAINTS ON OUR FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHERE AND HOW TO OPERATE DATACENTERS IN RESPONSE TO CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS OR GOVERNMENTAL RULES OR ACTIONS, MAY CAUSE HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES.

WE MAY HAVE OUTAGES, DATA LOSSES, AND DISRUPTIONS OF OUR ONLINE SERVICES IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE OPERATIONS INFRASTRUCTURE.

OUR INCREASING USER TRAFFIC, GROWTH IN SERVICES, AND THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DEMAND MORE COMPUTING POWER. WE SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS TO BUILD, PURCHASE, OR LEASE DATACENTERS AND EQUIPMENT AND TO UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TO HANDLE MORE TRAFFIC ON OUR WEBSITES AND IN OUR DATACENTERS. THESE DEMANDS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS WE INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF EXISTING SERVICES SUCH AS BING, EXCHANGE ONLINE, MICROSOFT AZURE, MICROSOFT ACCOUNT SERVICES, OFFICE 365, ONEDRIVE, SHAREPOINT ONLINE, SKYPE, XBOX LIVE, OUTLOOK.COM, AND WINDOWS STORES. WE ARE RAPIDLY GROWING OUR BUSINESS OF PROVIDING A PLATFORM AND BACK-END HOSTING FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD PARTIES TO THEIR END USERS. MAINTAINING, SECURING, AND EXPANDING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS EXPENSIVE AND COMPLEX. IT REQUIRES THAT WE MAINTAIN AN INTERNET CONNECTIVITY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT IS ROBUST AND RELIABLE WITHIN COMPETITIVE AND REGULATORY CONSTRAINTS THAT CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. INEFFICIENCIES OR OPERATIONAL FAILURES, INCLUDING TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT LOSS OF CUSTOMER DATA OR INSUFFICIENT INTERNET CONNECTIVITY, COULD DIMINISH THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND USER EXPERIENCE RESULTING IN CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY, CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, REGULATORY ACTIONS, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, AND LOSS OF CURRENT AND POTENTIAL USERS, SUBSCRIBERS, AND ADVERTISERS, EACH OF WHICH MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ITEM 1A

GOVERNMENT LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIVITY RELATING TO COMPETITION RULES MAY LIMIT HOW WE DESIGN AND MARKET OUR PRODUCTS.

AS A LEADING GLOBAL SOFTWARE AND DEVICE MAKER, GOVERNMENT AGENCIES CLOSELY SCRUTI

NIZE US UNDER U.S. AND FOREIGN COMPETITION LAWS. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTS ARE REGULATING COMPETITION LAW ACTIVITIES AND THIS INCLUDES INCREASED SCRUTINY IN POTENTIALLY LARGE MARKETS SUCH AS THE EUROPEAN UNION (EU), THE U.S., AND CHINA. SOME JU

RISDICTIONS ALSO ALLOW COMPETITORS OR CONSUMERS TO ASSERT CLAIMS OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT. U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BROUGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND CONTINUE TO SCRUTINIZE OUR BUSINESS.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION (THE COMMISSION) CLOSELY SCRUTINIZES THE DESIGN OF HIGH-VOLUME MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND THE TERMS ON WHICH WE MAKE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES USED IN THESE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS FILE FORMATS, PROGRAMMING INTERFACES, AND PROTOCOLS, AVAILABLE TO OTHER COMPANIES. FLAGSHIP PRODUCT RELEASES SUCH AS WINDOWS 10 CAN RECEIVE SIGNIFICANT SCRUTINY UNDER COMPETITION LAWS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN 2004, THE COMMISSION ORDERED US TO CREATE NEW VERSIONS OF OUR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM THAT DO NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN MULTIMEDIA TECHNOLOGIES AND TO PROVIDE OUR COMPETITORS WITH SPECIFICATIONS FOR HOW TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN PROPRIETARY WINDOWS COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS IN THEIR OWN PRODUCTS. IN 2009, THE COMMISSION ACCEPTED A SET OF COMMITMENTS OFFERED BY MICROSOFT TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSIONS CONCERNS RELATING TO COMPETITION IN WEB BROWSING SOFTWARE, INCLUDING AN UNDERTAKING TO ADDRESS COMMISSION CONCERNS RELATING TO INTEROPERABILITY. THE WEB BROWSING COMMITMENTS EXPIRED IN 2014. THE REMAINING OBLIGATIONS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO INNOVATE IN WINDOWS OR OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE, DIMINISH THE DEVELOPER APPEAL OF THE WINDOWS PLATFORM, AND INCREASE OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. THE AVAILABILITY OF LICENSES RELATED TO PROTOCOLS AND FILE FORMATS MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT BETTER MIMIC THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAMPER SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR PORTFOLIO OF FIRST-PARTY DEVICES CONTINUES TO GROW; AT THE SAME TIME OUR OEM PARTNERS OFFER A LARGE VARIETY OF DEVICES ON OUR PLATFORMS. AS A RESULT, INCREASINGLY WE BOTH COOPERATE AND COMPETE WITH OUR OEM PARTNERS, CREATING A RISK THAT WE FAIL TO DO SO IN COMPLIANCE WITH COMPETITION RULES. REGULATORY SCRUTINY IN THIS AREA MAY INCREASE. CERTAIN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN ASIA, HAVE ADVANCED ARGUMENTS UNDER THEIR COMPETITION LAWS THAT EXERT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON ROYALTIES FOR OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. BECAUSE THESE JURISDICTIONS ONLY RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED COMPETITION LAWS, THEIR ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE UNPREDICTABLE.

GOVERNMENT REGULATORY ACTIONS AND COURT DECISIONS SUCH AS THESE MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE BENEFITS OF OUR SOFTWARE TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, REDUCING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE REVENUE THAT COME FROM THEM. NEW COMPETITION LAW ACTIONS COULD BE INITIATED. THE OUTCOME OF SUCH ACTIONS, OR STEPS TAKEN TO AVOID THEM, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING.



WE MAY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WITHDRAWING PRODUCTS FROM CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES TO AVOID FINES OR DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS OF THOSE PRODUCTS TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT RULINGS, WHICH MAY ENTAIL A DELAY IN A PRODUCT RELEASE AND REMOVING FUNCTIONALITY THAT CUSTOMERS WANT OR ON WHICH DEVELOPERS RELY.



WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE AVAILABLE LICENSES TO OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES ON TERMS THAT DO NOT REFLECT THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE OR DO NOT PROTECT OUR ASSOCIATED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.



THE RULINGS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY BE PRECEDENT IN OTHER COMPETITION LAW PROCEEDINGS.



WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF ONGOING COMMITMENTS BECAUSE OF COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS, CONSENT DECREES, OR OTHER VOLUNTARY ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN. IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESE COMMITMENTS, WE MAY INCUR LITIGATION COSTS AND BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL FINES OR OTHER REMEDIAL ACTIONS.



OUR ABILITY TO REALIZE ANTICIPATED WINDOWS 10 POST-SALE MONETIZATION OPPORTUNITIES MAY BE LIMITED.

OUR GLOBAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER ANTI-CORRUPTION, TRADE PROTECTION, AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND OTHER ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS (ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS) PROHIBIT CORRUPT PAYMENTS BY OUR EMPLOYEES, VENDORS, OR AGENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE RECEIVE INQUIRIES FROM AUTHORITIES IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE AND REPORTS FROM EMPLOYEES AND OTHERS ABOUT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND OUR COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS. SPECIFICALLY, WE HAVE BEEN COOPERATING WITH AUTHORITIES IN THE U.S. IN CONNECTION WITH REPORTS CONCERNING OUR COMPLIANCE WITH THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT IN VARIOUS COUNTRIES. WHILE WE DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO OUR GLOBAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND HAVE IMPLEMENTED POLICIES, TRAINING, AND INTERNAL CONTROLS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CORRUPT PAYMENTS, OUR EMPLOYEES, VENDORS, OR AGENTS MAY VIOLATE OUR POLICIES. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FINES AND PENALTIES, CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AGAINST US, OUR OFFICERS, OR OUR EMPLOYEES, PROHIBITIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF OUR BUSINESS, AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TRADE PROTECTION LAWS, POLICIES, AND MEASURES, SANCTIONS, AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LEGAL LIABILITY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE IF WE SELL GOODS OR SERVICES IN VIOLATION OF U.S. TRADE SANCTIONS ON COUNTRIES SUCH AS IRAN, NORTH KOREA, CUBA, SUDAN, AND SYRIA.

OTHER REGULATORY AREAS THAT MAY APPLY TO OUR PRODUCTS AND ONLINE SERVICES OFFERINGS INCLUDE USER PRIVACY, TE

LECOMMUNICATIONS, DATA STORAGE AND PROTECTION, AND ONLINE CONTENT. FOR EXAMPLE, REGULATORS MAY TAKE THE POSITION THAT OUR OFFERINGS SUCH AS SKYPE ARE COVERED BY LAWS REGULATING TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. DATA PROTECTION AUTHORITIES MAY ASSERT THAT OUR CO

LLECTION, USE, AND MANAGEMENT OF CUSTOMER DATA IS INCONSISTENT WITH THEIR LAWS AND REGULATIONS. APPLYING THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO OUR BUSINESS IS OFTEN UNCLEAR, SUBJECT TO CHANGE OVER TIME, AND SOMETIMES MAY CONFLICT FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION.

ADDITIONALLY, THESE LAWS AND GOVERNMENTS APPROACH TO THEIR ENFORCEMENT, AND OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ARE CONTINUING TO EVOLVE. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE TYPES OF REGULATION MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT COSTS OR REQUIRE CHANGES IN PRODUCTS OR BUSINESS PRACTICES

THAT RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE. NONCOMPLIANCE COULD RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES OR ORDERS WE STOP THE ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANT ACTIVITY.

LAWS AND REGULATIONS RELATING TO THE HANDLING OF PERSONAL DATA MAY IMPEDE THE ADOPTION OF OUR SERVICES OR RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS, LEGAL CLAIMS, OR FINES AGAINST US.

THE GROWTH OF OUR INTERNET- AND CLOUD-BASED SERVICES INTERNATIONALLY RELIES INCREASINGLY ON THE MOVEMENT OF DATA ACROSS NATIONAL BOUNDARIES. LEGAL REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO THE COLLECTION, STORAGE, HANDLING, AND TRANSFER OF PERSONAL DATA CONTINUE TO EVOLVE. FOR EXAMPLE, THE EU AND THE U.S. FORMALLY ENTERED INTO A NEW FRAMEWORK IN JULY 2016 THAT PROVIDES A MECHANISM FOR COMPANIES TO TRANSFER DATA FROM EU MEMBER STATES TO THE U.S. THIS NEW FRAMEWORK, CALLED THE PRIVACY SHIELD, IS INTENDED TO ADDRESS SHORTCOMINGS IDENTIFIED BY THE EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE IN A PREDECESSOR MECHANISM. THE PRIVACY SHIELD AND OTHER MECHANISMS ARE SUBJECT TO REVIEW BY THE EUROPEAN COURTS, WHICH MAY LEAD TO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE LEGAL BASIS FOR DATA TRANSFERS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC. IN 2016, THE EU ADOPTED A NEW LAW GOVERNING DATA PRACTICES AND PRIVACY CALLED THE GENERAL DATA PROTECTION REGULATION (GDPR), WHICH BECOMES EFFECTIVE IN MAY 2018. THE LAW REQUIRES FIRMS TO MEET NEW REQUIREMENTS REGARDING THE HANDLING OF PERSONAL DATA. ENGINEERING EFFORTS TO BUILD NEW CAPABILITIES TO FACILITATE COMPLIANCE WITH THE LAW MAY ENTAIL SUBSTANTIAL EXPENSE AND THE DIVERSION OF ENGINEERING RESOURCES FROM OTHER PROJECTS. IF WE ARE UNABLE TO ENGINEER PRODUCTS THAT MEET MICROSOFTS LEGAL DUTIES OR HELP OUR CUSTOMERS MEET THEIR OBLIGATIONS UNDER THE GDPR OR OTHER DATA REGULATIONS, WE MIGHT EXPERIENCE REDUCED DEMAND FOR OUR OFFERINGS. NON-COMPLIANCE WITH THE GDPR MAY RESULT IN MONETARY PENALTIES OF UP TO 4% OF WORLDWIDE REVENUE.

ONGOING LEGAL REVIEWS BY REGULATORS MAY RESULT IN BURDENSOME OR INCONSISTENT REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING THE LOCATION AND MOVEMENT OF OUR CUSTOMER AND INTERNAL EMPLOYEE DATA AS WELL AS THE MANAGEMENT OF THAT DATA. COMPLIANCE MAY REQUIRE CHANGES IN SERVICES, BUSINESS PRACTICES, OR INTERNAL SYSTEMS THAT RESULT IN INCREASED COSTS, LOWER REVENUE, REDUCED EFFICIENCY, OR GREATER DIFFICULTY IN COMPETING WITH FOREIGN-BASED FIRMS. FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH EXISTING OR NEW RULES MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT PENALTIES OR ORDERS TO STOP THE ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANT ACTIVITY.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESS IS BASED ON SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENTED EMPLOYEES. THE MARKET FOR HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS AND LEADERS IN OUR INDUSTRY IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT INTERNATIONALLY BY RESTRICTIVE DOMESTIC IMMIGRATION LAWS. CHANGES TO U.S. IMMIGRATION POLICIES THAT RESTRAIN THE FLOW OF TECHNICAL AND PROFESSIONAL TALENT MAY INHIBIT OUR ABILITY TO ADEQUATELY STAFF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS. IF WE ARE LESS SUCCESSFUL IN OUR RECRUITING EFFORTS, OR IF WE CANNOT RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. EFFECTIVE SUCCESSION PLANNING IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS. FAILURE TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE AND SMOOTH TRANSITIONS INVOLVING KEY EMPLOYEES COULD HINDER OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING AND EXECUTION. HOW EMPLOYMENT-RELATED LAWS ARE INTERPRETED AND APPLIED TO OUR WORKFORCE PRACTICES MAY RESULT IN INCREASED OPERATING COSTS AND LESS FLEXIBILITY IN HOW WE MEET OUR WORKFORCE NEEDS.

WE HAVE CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AGAINST US THAT MAY RESULT IN ADVERSE OUTCOMES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS. THESE CLAIMS MAY ARISE FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF BUSINESS PRACTICES AND INITIATIVES, INCLUDING MAJOR NEW PRODUCT RELEASES SUCH AS WINDOWS 10, SIGNIFICANT BUSINESS TRANSACTIONS, WARRANTY OR PRODUCT CLAIMS, AND EMPLOYMENT PRACTICES. ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN SOME OR ALL OF THESE CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. THE LITIGATION AND OTHER CLAIMS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COULD OCCUR FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECT OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S. AND MANY FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN. WE REGULARLY ARE UNDER AUDIT BY TAX AUTHORITIES IN DIFFERENT JURISDICTIONS. ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PRESSURES TO INCREASE TAX REVENUE IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS MAY MAKE RESOLVING TAX DISPUTES FAVORABLY MORE DIFFICULT. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF TAX AUDITS AND ANY RELATED LITIGATION IN THE JURISDICTIONS WHERE WE ARE SUBJECT TO TAXATION COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. THE RESULTS OF AN AUDIT OR LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS IN WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE.

WE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERAT

ING INCOME FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND ANY REPATRIATION OF FUNDS CURRENTLY HELD IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS TO THE U.S. MAY RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS FROM CONGRESS TO CHANGE U.S. TAX LAWS THAT

WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT HOW U.S. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS ARE TAXED ON FOREIGN EARNINGS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OR IN WHAT FORM ANY PROPOSED LEGISLATION MAY PASS, IF ENACTED, IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR TAX EXPENSE AND C

ASH FLOWS.

OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR SUPPLY PROBLEMS.

OUR VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE PRODUCTS SUCH AS XBOX CONSOLES, SURFACE DEVICES, AND OTHER DEVICES WE DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, AND MARKET ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND CAN HAVE DEFECTS IN DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, OR ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE. WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, LOST REVENUE, AND REPUTATIONAL HARM AS A RESULT OF RECALLS, SAFETY ALERTS, OR PRODUCT LIABILITY CLAIMS IF WE FAIL TO PREVENT, DETECT, OR ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES THROUGH DESIGN, TESTING, OR WARRANTY REPAIRS. WE ACQUIRE SOME DEVICE COMPONENTS FROM SOLE SUPPLIERS. OUR COMPETITORS USE SOME OF THE SAME SUPPLIERS AND THEIR DEMAND FOR HARDWARE COMPONENTS CAN AFFECT THE CAPACITY AVAILABLE TO US. IF A COMPONENT FROM A SOLE-SOURCE SUPPLIER IS DELAYED OR BECOMES UNAVAILABLE, WHETHER BECAUSE OF SUPPLIER CAPACITY CONSTRAINT OR INDUSTRY SHORTAGES, WE MAY NOT OBTAIN TIMELY REPLACEMENT SUPPLIES, RESULTING IN REDUCED SALES. COMPONENT SHORTAGES, EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY, OR PRICE REDUCTIONS RESULTING IN INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE. XBOX CONSOLES, SURFACE DEVICES, AND OTHER HARDWARE ARE ASSEMBLED IN ASIA AND OTHER GEOGRAPHIES THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN, RESULTING IN SHORTAGES THAT WOULD AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. THESE SAME RISKS WOULD APPLY TO ANY OTHER VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE MAY OFFER.

OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ALSO MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR RELIABILITY PROBLEMS. THE HIGHLY-SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE DEVELOP MAY CONTAIN BUGS AND OTHER DEFECTS THAT INTERFERE WITH THEIR INTENDED OPERATION. ANY DEFECTS WE DO NOT DETECT AND FIX IN PRE-RELEASE TESTING COULD CAUSE REDUCED SALES AND REVENUE, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, REPAIR OR REMEDIATION COSTS, DELAYS IN THE RELEASE OF NEW PRODUCTS OR VERSIONS, OR LEGAL LIABILITY. ALTHOUGH OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE OR LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO LIABILITY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THESE PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND LEGAL CHALLENGE.

WE STRIVE TO EMPOWER ALL PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS TO ACHIEVE MORE, AND ACCESSIBILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS IS AN IMPORTANT ASPECT OF THIS GOAL. THERE IS INCREASING PRESSURE FROM ADVOCACY GROUPS, REGULATORS, COMPETITORS, AND CUSTOMERS TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY MORE ACCESSIBLE. IF OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT MEET CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS OR EMERGING GLOBAL ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS, WE COULD LOSE SALES OPPORTUNITIES OR FACE REGULATORY ACTIONS.

OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS EXPOSES US TO OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS.

OUR CUSTOMERS ARE LOCATED IN OVER 200 COUNTRIES AND A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES. THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS CREATES OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS. EMERGING MARKETS ARE A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL GROWTH STRATEGY. THE DEVELOPING NATURE OF THESE MARKETS PRESENTS SEVERAL RISKS, INCLUDING DETERIORATION OF SOCIAL, POLITICAL, LABOR, OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN A COUNTRY OR REGION, AND DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING FOREIGN OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY EXPOSURE, SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. COMPETITIVE OR REGULATORY PRESSURE TO MAKE OUR PRICING STRUCTURE UNIFORM MIGHT REQUIRE THAT WE REDUCE THE SALES PRICE OF OUR SOFTWARE IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR GEOPOLITICAL CONDITIONS MAY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS.

A DISRUPTION OR FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEMS OR OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE, WEATHER EVENT, CYBER-ATTACK, TERRORIST ATTACK, OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENT COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN COMPLETING SALES, PROVIDING SERVICES, OR PERFORMING OTHER CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER ESSENTIAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE IN THE SEATTLE, WASHINGTON AREA, AND WE HAVE OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF CALIFORNIA, BOTH OF WHICH ARE SEISMICALLY ACTIVE REGIONS. A CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT RESULTS IN THE DESTRUCTION OR DISRUPTION OF ANY OF OUR CRITICAL BUSINESS OR IT SYSTEMS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH MORE SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS IN THE CLOUD PUTS A PREMIUM ON THE RESILIENCE OF OUR SYSTEMS AND STRENGTH OF OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT PLANS, AND MAGNIFIES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PROLONGED SERVICE OUTAGES ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

ABRUPT POLITICAL CHANGE, TERRORIST ACTIVITY, AND ARMED CONFLICT POSE A RISK OF GENERAL ECONOMIC DISRUPTION IN AFFECT

ED COUNTRIES, WHICH MAY INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. THESE CONDITIONS ALSO MAY ADD UNCERTAINTY TO THE TIMING AND BUDGET FOR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT DECISIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS, AND MAY CAUSE SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS FOR HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS. GEOPOLITICAL C

HANGE MAY RESULT IN CHANGING REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS THAT COULD IMPACT OUR OPERATING STRATEGIES, ACCESS TO GLOBAL MARKETS, HIRING, AND PROFITABILITY. GEOPOLITICAL INSTABILITY MAY LEAD TO SANCTIONS AND IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO DO BUSINESS IN SOME MARKETS OR WI

TH SOME PUBLIC-SECTOR CUSTOMERS. EMERGING NATIONALIST TRENDS IN SPECIFIC COUNTRIES MAY SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER THE TRADE ENVIRONMENT. CHANGES TO TRADE POLICY OR AGREEMENTS MAY RESULT IN HIGHER TARIFFS, LOCAL SOURCING INITIATIVES, OR OTHER DEVELOPMENTS THAT MAK

E IT MORE DIFFICULT TO SELL OUR PRODUCTS IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. ANY OF THESE CHANGES MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT OUR REVENUES.

THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY OR THE IT INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR ARE UNCLEAR. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY, DEMAND OR AVAILABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY OR OTHER NATURAL RESOURCES MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING NATURAL RESOURCES, NECESSARY TO RUN OUR BUSINESS. CHANGES IN WEATHER WHERE WE OPERATE MAY INCREASE THE COSTS OF POWERING AND COOLING COMPUTER HARDWARE WE USE TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE AND PROVIDE CLOUD-BASED SERVICES.

ADVERSE ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WORSENING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INFLATION, RECESSION, OR OTHER CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MAY CAUSE LOWER IT SPENDING AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. IF DEMAND FOR PCS, SERVERS, AND OTHER COMPUTING DEVICES DECLINES, OR CONSUMER OR BUSINESS SPENDING FOR THOSE PRODUCTS DECLINES, OUR REVENUE WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE COMES FROM OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. AN EXTENDED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN RESULTING FROM FAILING TO PASS BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS, ADOPT CONTINUING FUNDING RESOLUTIONS OR RAISE THE DEBT CEILING, AND OTHER BUDGETARY DECISIONS LIMITING OR DELAYING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING, COULD REDUCE GOVERNMENT IT SPENDING ON OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

OUR PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM RELIES ON AN EXTENSIVE PARTNER AND RETAIL NETWORK. OEMS BUILDING DEVICES THAT RUN OUR SOFTWARE HAVE ALSO BEEN A SIGNIFICANT MEANS OF DISTRIBUTION. THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON OUR PARTNERS, SUCH AS THE BANKRUPTCY OF A MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR, OEM, OR RETAILER, COULD CAUSE SALES CHANNEL DISRUPTION.

CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ALSO MAY IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY HAVE PURCHASED. AS A RESULT, ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND WRITE-OFFS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MAY INCREASE.

WE MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS HOLDINGS, TYPES, AND MATURITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO GENERAL CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, MARKET, AND INTEREST RATE RISKS, WHICH MAY BE EXACERBATED BY UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT AFFECT GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COMPRISES U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. IF GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS DECLINE FOR LONG PERIODS, OR IF THERE IS A DOWNGRADE OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CREDIT RATING DUE TO AN ACTUAL OR THREATENED DEFAULT ON GOVERNMENT DEBT, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND WE COULD DETERMINE THAT MORE OF OUR INVESTMENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE, REQUIRING IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

CHANGES IN OUR SALES ORGANIZATION MAY IMPACT REVENUES.

IN JULY 2017, WE ANNOUNCED PLANS TO REORGANIZE OUR GLOBAL SALES ORGANIZATION TO HELP ENABLE CUSTOMERS DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION, ADD GREATER TECHNICAL ABILITY TO OUR SALES FORCE, AND CREATE POOLED RESOURCES THAT CAN BE USED ACROSS COUNTRIES AND INDUSTRIES. THE REORGANIZATION IS THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN OUR GLOBAL SALES ORGANIZATION IN MICROSOFTS HISTORY, INVOLVING EMPLOYEES CHANGING ROLES, ADDING ADDITIONAL TALENT, REALIGNING TEAMS, AND ONBOARDING NEW PARTNERS. SUCCESSFULLY EXECUTING THESE CHANGES WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT FACTOR IN ENABLING FUTURE REVENUE GROWTH. AS WE NAVIGATE THROUGH THIS TRANSITION, SALES, PROFITABILITY, AND CASH FLOW COULD BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED.
