RESOURCES. WE COMPETE PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF PRODUCT QUALITY AND VARIETY, TIMING OF PRODUCT RELEASES, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING.

OUR XBOX GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS COMPETES WITH CONSOLE PLATFORMS FROM NINTENDO AND SONY, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE A LARGE, ESTABLISHED BASE OF CUSTOMERS. THE LIFECYCLE FOR GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES

AVERAGES FIVE TO 10 YEARS. WE RELEASED XBOX 360, OUR SECOND GENERATION CONSOLE, IN NOVEMBER 2005. NINTENDO AND SONY RELEASED NEW VERSIONS OF THEIR GAME CONSOLES IN LATE 2006. WE BELIEVE THE SUCCESS OF GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES IS DETERMINED

EUROPE, AND ASIA REGIONS.

TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD AND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND USABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE LOCALIZE MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS TO REFLECT LOCAL LANGUAGES AND CONVENTIONS. LOCALIZING A PRODUCT MAY REQUIRE MODIFYING THE USER INTERFACE, ALTERING DIALOG BOXES, AND TRANSLATING TEXT.

THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENTED 13%, 13%, AND 14%, RESPECTIVELY, OF REVENUE IN EACH OF THOSE YEARS. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

WE DEVELOP MOST OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INTERNALLY. INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS US TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT COME FROM CLOSER TECHNICAL CONTROL OVER OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IT ALSO

GIVES US THE FREEDOM TO DECIDE WHICH MODIFICATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. WE STRIVE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE ABOUT CHANGING USAGE PATTERNS AND HARDWARE ADVANCES THAT MAY AFFECT

SOFTWARE DESIGN. BEFORE RELEASING NEW SOFTWARE PLATFORMS, WE PROVIDE APPLICATION VENDORS WITH A RANGE OF RESOURCES AND GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, AND TESTING. GENERALLY, WE ALSO CREATE PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION INTERNALLY.

WE PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INVESTMENTS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. WE WORK ACTIVELY IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY TO ENSURE THE ENFORCEMENT

OF COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, TRADE SECRET, AND OTHER PROTECTIONS THAT APPLY TO OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, BUSINESS PLANS, AND BRANDING. WE ARE A LEADER AMONG TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN PURSUING PATENTS AND CURRENTLY HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF

OVER 31,000 U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PATENTS ISSUED AND OVER 38,000 PENDING. WHILE WE EMPLOY MUCH OF OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EXCLUSIVELY IN MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE ALSO ENGAGE IN OUTBOUND AND INBOUND LICENSING OF

SPECIFIC PATENTED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE INCORPORATED INTO LICENSEES OR MICROSOFTS PRODUCTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO BROADER CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES COVERING ENTIRE GROUPS OF PATENTS. WE ALSO

PURCHASE OR LICENSE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE INCORPORATE INTO OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR

RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. WE BELIEVE OUR CONTINUING

RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE LICENSE OR OTHER AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS.

INVESTING IN THE FUTURE

MICROSOFTS SUCCESS IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO CREATE NEW AND

COMPELLING PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND EXPERIENCES FOR OUR USERS, INITIATE AND EMBRACE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, TO ENTER NEW GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT MARKETS, AND TO DRIVE BROAD ADOPTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE INVEST IN A RANGE OF EMERGING

TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND BREAKTHROUGHS THAT WE BELIEVE OFFER SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY. WE MAINTAIN OUR LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACROSS A WIDE SPECTRUM OF

TECHNOLOGIES, TOOLS, AND PLATFORMS SPANNING COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION, INFORMATION ACCESS AND ORGANIZATION, ENTERTAINMENT, BUSINESS AND E-COMMERCE, ADVERTISING, AND DEVICES.

WHILE OUR MAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN REDMOND, WASHINGTON, WE ALSO OPERATE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN OTHER

PARTS OF THE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING CANADA, CHINA, DENMARK, ESTONIA, GERMANY, INDIA, IRELAND, ISRAEL, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THIS GLOBAL APPROACH HELPS US REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN LOCAL MARKETS AND ENABLES US TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT TOP

TALENT FROM ACROSS THE WORLD. WE GENERALLY FUND RESEARCH AT

THE CORPORATE LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING BEYOND IMMEDIATE PRODUCT CONSIDERATIONS TO OPPORTUNITIES FURTHER IN THE FUTURE. WE ALSO FUND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AT THE BUSINESS

SEGMENT LEVEL. MUCH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS COORDINATED WITH OTHER SEGMENTS AND LEVERAGED ACROSS THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION TO OUR MAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS, WE ALSO OPERATE MICROSOFT RESEARCH. MICROSOFT RESEARCH IS ONE OF THE WORLDS LARGEST COMPUTER SCIENCE RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS, AND WORKS IN CLOSE

COLLABORATION WITH TOP UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD TO ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, PROVIDING US A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON FUTURE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS.

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND OUR BROAD FOCUS ON LONG-TERM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WE SEE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE FUTURE GROWTH IN SMART CONNECTED DEVICES, CLOUD COMPUTING,

ENTERTAINMENT, SEARCH, COMMUNICATIONS, AND PRODUCTIVITY.

DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING

WE MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRIMARILY THROUGH THE FOLLOWING CHANNELS: OEM; DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS; AND ONLINE.

OEM

WE DISTRIBUTE SOFTWARE

THROUGH OEMS THAT PRE-INSTALL OUR SOFTWARE ON NEW PCS, SERVERS, SMARTPHONES, AND OTHER INTELLIGENT DEVICES THAT THEY SELL TO END CUSTOMERS. THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE OEM BUSINESS IS THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM PRE-INSTALLED ON PCS. OEMS ALSO

SELL HARDWARE PRE-INSTALLED WITH OTHER MICROSOFT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SERVER AND EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS SUCH AS OUR MICROSOFT OFFICE SUITE. IN ADDITION TO THESE PRODUCTS, WE ALSO MARKET THROUGH OEMS SOFTWARE SERVICES SUCH AS OUR

WINDOWS LIVE ESSENTIALS SUITE.

THERE ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF OEMS. THE LARGEST OEMS, MANY OF WHICH OPERATE GLOBALLY, ARE REFERRED

TO AS DIRECT OEMS, AS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM IS MANAGED THROUGH A DIRECT AGREEMENT BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND THE MANUFACTURER. WE HAVE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS COVERING ONE OR MORE OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE MULTINATIONAL

OEMS, INCLUDING ACER, ASUS, DELL, FUJITSU, HTC, HEWLETT-PACKARD, LG, LENOVO, NOKIA, SAMSUNG, SONY, TOSHIBA, AND WITH MANY REGIONAL AND LOCAL OEMS. THE SECOND BROAD CATEGORY OF OEMS CONSISTS OF LOWER-VOLUME PC MANUFACTURERS (ALSO CALLED SYSTEM

BUILDERS), WHICH SOURCE THEIR MICROSOFT SOFTWARE FOR PRE-INSTALLATION AND LOCAL REDISTRIBUTION PRIMARILY THROUGH THE MICROSOFT DISTRIBUTOR CHANNEL RATHER THAN THROUGH A DIRECT AGREEMENT OR RELATIONSHIP WITH MICROSOFT. SOME OF THE DISTRIBUTORS

IN THE MICROSOFT DISTRIBUTOR CHANNEL ARE GLOBAL, SUCH AS INGRAM MICRO AND TECH DATA, BUT MOST OPERATE AT A LOCAL OR REGIONAL LEVEL.

DISTRIBUTORS AND

RESELLERS

MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS TRANSACT DIRECTLY WITH US, WITH

SALES SUPPORT FROM SOLUTION INTEGRATORS, INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS, WEB AGENCIES, AND DEVELOPERS THAT ADVISE ORGANIZATIONS ON LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISORS). ORGANIZATIONS ALSO LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS

AND SERVICES INDIRECTLY, PRIMARILY THROUGH LARGE ACCOUNT RESELLERS (LARS), DISTRIBUTORS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS (VARS), OEMS, SYSTEM BUILDER CHANNELS, AND RETAILERS. ALTHOUGH EACH TYPE OF RESELLING PARTNER REACHES

ORGANIZATIONS OF ALL SIZES, LARS ARE PRIMARILY ENGAGED WITH LARGE ORGANIZATIONS, DISTRIBUTORS RESELL PRIMARILY TO VARS, AND VARS TYPICALLY REACH SMALL-SIZED AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS. ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISORS TYPICALLY ARE ALSO AUTHORIZED

AS LARS AND OPERATE AS RESELLERS FOR OUR OTHER LICENSING PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE SELECT PLUS AND OPEN LICENSING PROGRAMS DISCUSSED UNDER LICENSING OPTIONS BELOW. SOME OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS INCLUDE INGRAM MICRO AND TECH DATA, AND SOME OF OUR

LARGEST RESELLERS INCLUDE CDW, DELL, INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, AND SOFTWARE HOUSE INTERNATIONAL. OUR MICROSOFT DYNAMICS SOFTWARE OFFERINGS ARE LICENSED TO ENTERPRISES THROUGH A GLOBAL NETWORK OF CHANNEL PARTNERS PROVIDING VERTICAL SOLUTIONS AND

SPECIALIZED SERVICES. WE DISTRIBUTE OUR RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT NON-EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORS, AUTHORIZED REPLICATORS, RESELLERS, AND RETAIL OUTLETS, INCLUDING MICROSOFT STORES. INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS OBTAIN THESE PRODUCTS

PRIMARILY THROUGH RETAIL OUTLETS, SUCH AS WAL-MART AND DIXONS. WE HAVE A NETWORK OF FIELD SALES REPRESENTATIVES AND FIELD SUPPORT PERSONNEL THAT SOLICITS ORDERS FROM DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS, AND PROVIDES PRODUCT TRAINING AND SALES SUPPORT.

ONLINE

ALTHOUGH CLIENT-BASED SOFTWARE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS, INCREASINGLY WE ARE DELIVERING ADDITIONAL VALUE TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. WE PROVIDE ONLINE CONTENT AND

SERVICES TO CONSUMERS THROUGH BING, MSN PORTALS AND CHANNELS, MICROSOFT OFFICE WEB APPS, WINDOWS PHONE MARKETPLACE, XBOX LIVE, AND ZUNE MARKETPLACE. WE PROVIDE CONTENT AND SERVICES TO BUSINESS USERS THROUGH THE MICROSOFT ONLINE SERVICES PLATFORM,

WHICH INCLUDES CLOUD-BASED SERVICES SUCH AS EXCHANGE ONLINE, MICROSOFT DYNAMICS CRM ONLINE, MICROSOFT LYNC, MICROSOFT OFFICE 365, MICROSOFT OFFICE COMMUNICATIONS ONLINE, MICROSOFT OFFICE LIVE MEETING, SQL AZURE, SHAREPOINT ONLINE, WINDOWS AZURE, AND

WINDOWS INTUNE. OTHER SERVICES DELIVERED ONLINE INCLUDE OUR ONLINE ADVERTISING PLATFORM WITH OFFERINGS FOR ADVERTISERS, AS WELL AS MICROSOFT DEVELOPER NETWORKS SUBSCRIPTION CONTENT AND UPDATES, PERIODIC PRODUCT UPDATES, AND ONLINE TECHNICAL AND

PRACTICE READINESS RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR PARTNERS IN DEVELOPING AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS. WE ALSO SELL OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH OUR ONLINE STORE, MICROSOFTSTORE.COM.

LICENSING OPTIONS

WE

LICENSE SOFTWARE TO ORGANIZATIONS UNDER ARRANGEMENTS THAT ALLOW THE END-USER CUSTOMER TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE THEM WITH A MEANS OF DOING SO WITHOUT HAVING TO ACQUIRE SEPARATE PACKAGED PRODUCT THROUGH RETAIL CHANNELS. IN DELIVERING ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS TO THE MARKET, WE USE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR

ORGANIZATIONS OF VARIOUS SIZES. WHILE THESE PROGRAMS MAY DIFFER IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD, GENERALLY THEY INCLUDE THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW.

OPEN

LICENSING

DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR SMALL-TO-MEDIUM ORGANIZATIONS, OPEN PROGRAMS ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL OR SUBSCRIPTION

LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (TWO OR THREE YEARS DEPENDING ON THE OPEN PROGRAMS USED). THE OFFERING THAT CONVEYS RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF CERTAIN

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD IS CALLED SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. SOFTWARE ASSURANCE ALSO PROVIDES SUPPORT, TOOLS, AND TRAINING TO HELP CUSTOMERS DEPLOY AND USE SOFTWARE EFFICIENTLY. OPEN PROGRAMS HAS SEVERAL VARIATIONS TO FIT CUSTOMERS

DIVERSE WAY OF PURCHASING. UNDER THE OPEN LICENSE PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS CAN ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY, OR LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. THEY CAN ALSO RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS.

SELECT PLUS LICENSING

DESIGNED PRIMARILY

FOR MEDIUM-TO-LARGE ORGANIZATIONS, THE SELECT PLUS PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, SOFTWARE ASSURANCE OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY THREE YEARS OR LESS). SIMILAR TO OPEN

PROGRAMS, THE SELECT PLUS PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY, ACQUIRE LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, OR RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS. ONLINE SERVICES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR

PURCHASE THROUGH THE SELECT PLUS PROGRAM, AND SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED WITH TERMS BETWEEN ONE AND THREE YEARS.

SERVICES PROVIDER

LICENSING

THE MICROSOFT SERVICES PROVIDER LICENSE AGREEMENT (SPLA) IS A PROGRAM TARGETED TO SERVICE PROVIDERS AND

INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS (ISVS) ALLOWING THESE PARTNERS TO PROVIDE SOFTWARE SERVICES AND HOSTED APPLICATIONS TO THEIR END CUSTOMERS. AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED WITH A THREE-YEAR TERM, AND PARTNERS ARE BILLED MONTHLY BASED

UPON CONSUMPTION.

ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT LICENSING

ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS ARE TARGETED AT MEDIUM AND LARGE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WANT TO ACQUIRE LICENSES TO ONLINE SERVICES AND/OR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, ALONG WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, FOR ALL OR SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF THEIR

ENTERPRISE. ENTERPRISES CAN ELECT TO EITHER ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES OR, UNDER THE ENTERPRISE SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAM, CAN ACQUIRE NON-PERPETUAL, SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENTS FOR A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY THREE YEARS). ONLINE SERVICES ARE ALSO

AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE THROUGH THE ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT AND SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED WITH THREE YEAR TERMS.

CUSTOMERS

OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS, SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS, ENTERPRISES, GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS,

EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, APPLICATION DEVELOPERS, AND OEMS. CONSUMERS AND SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS OBTAIN OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS, AND OEMS. NO SALES TO AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER

ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF FISCAL YEAR 2012, 2011, OR 2010 REVENUE. OUR PRACTICE IS TO SHIP OUR PRODUCTS PROMPTLY UPON RECEIPT OF PURCHASE ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS; CONSEQUENTLY, BACKLOG IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH

FLOWS, AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION ACROSS ALL MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH MAY LEAD TO

LOWER REVENUE OR OPERATING MARGINS.

COMPETITION IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR.

OUR COMPETITORS RANGE IN

SIZE FROM DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL COMPANIES WITH SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO SMALL, SPECIALIZED FIRMS WHOSE NARROWER PRODUCT LINES MAY LET THEM BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEPLOYING TECHNICAL, MARKETING, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. BARRIERS

TO ENTRY IN OUR BUSINESSES GENERALLY ARE LOW AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS CAN BE DISTRIBUTED BROADLY AND QUICKLY AT RELATIVELY LOW COST. MANY OF THE AREAS IN WHICH WE COMPETE EVOLVE RAPIDLY WITH CHANGING AND DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, SHIFTING USER NEEDS,

AND FREQUENT INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE DEPENDS ON OUR SUCCESS IN MAKING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS THAT APPEAL TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS.

COMPETITION AMONG PLATFORMS, ECOSYSTEMS, AND DEVICES.

AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN TO CREATE

PLATFORM-BASED ECOSYSTEMS ON WHICH MANY PARTICIPANTS CAN BUILD DIVERSE SOLUTIONS. A WELL-ESTABLISHED ECOSYSTEM CREATES BENEFICIAL NETWORK EFFECTS AMONG USERS, APPLICATION DEVELOPERS AND THE PLATFORM PROVIDER THAT CAN ACCELERATE GROWTH. ESTABLISHING

SIGNIFICANT SCALE IN THE MARKETPLACE IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE MARGINS. THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF A VIBRANT ECOSYSTEM INCREASES AS WE LAUNCH THE WINDOWS 8 OPERATING SYSTEM, SURFACE DEVICES, AND ASSOCIATED CLOUD-BASED

SERVICES. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM FIRMS THAT PROVIDE COMPETING PLATFORMS, APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES.



A COMPETING VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED MODEL, IN WHICH A SINGLE FIRM CONTROLS THE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ELEMENTS OF A PRODUCT AND RELATED SERVICES, HAS BEEN

SUCCESSFUL WITH SOME CONSUMER PRODUCTS SUCH AS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, MOBILE PHONES, GAMING CONSOLES, AND DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS. THESE COMPETITORS ALSO EARN REVENUE FROM SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRATED WITH THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLATFORM. WE ALSO

OFFER VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; HOWEVER, OUR COMPETITORS HAVE BEEN IN THE MARKET LONGER AND IN SOME CASES HAVE ESTABLISHED SIGNIFICANTLY LARGE USER BASES. EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH THE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED

MODEL WILL INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE AND REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.



WE DERIVE SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE FROM LICENSES OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS ON PERSONAL COMPUTERS. THE PROLIFERATION OF ALTERNATIVE DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS, IN

PARTICULAR MOBILE DEVICES SUCH AS SMARTPHONES AND TABLET COMPUTERS, CREATES CHALLENGES FROM COMPETING SOFTWARE PLATFORMS. THESE DEVICES COMPETE ON MULTIPLE BASES INCLUDING PRICE AND THE PERCEIVED UTILITY OF THE DEVICE AND ITS PLATFORM. USERS MAY

INCREASINGLY TURN TO THESE DEVICES TO PERFORM FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFORMED BY PERSONAL COMPUTERS IN THE PAST. EVEN IF MANY USERS VIEW THESE DEVICES AS COMPLEMENTARY TO A PERSONAL COMPUTER, THE PREVALENCE OF THESE DEVICES MAY MAKE IT MORE

DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT APPLICATIONS DEVELOPERS TO OUR PLATFORMS. IN ADDITION, OUR SURFACE DEVICES WILL COMPETE WITH PRODUCTS MADE BY OUR OEM PARTNERS, WHICH MAY AFFECT THEIR COMMITMENT TO OUR PLATFORM.



COMPETING PLATFORMS HAVE APPLICATIONS MARKETPLACES (SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS STORES) WITH SCALE AND SIGNIFICANT INSTALLED BASES ON MOBILE DEVICES.

THESE APPLICATIONS LEVERAGE FREE AND USER-PAID SERVICES THAT OVER TIME RESULT IN DISINCENTIVES FOR USERS TO SWITCH TO COMPETING PLATFORMS. IN ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST SUCCESSFULLY ENLIST DEVELOPERS TO WRITE APPLICATIONS FOR OUR MARKETPLACE AND

ENSURE THAT THESE APPLICATIONS HAVE HIGH QUALITY, CUSTOMER APPEAL AND VALUE. EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH THESE APPLICATION MARKETPLACES MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE AND LOWER OUR OPERATING MARGINS.

ITEM 1A

BUSINESS MODEL COMPETITION.

COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US BASED ON A

GROWING VARIETY OF BUSINESS MODELS.



UNDER THE LICENSE-BASED PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE MODEL THAT GENERATES MOST OF OUR REVENUE, WE BEAR THE COSTS OF CONVERTING ORIGINAL IDEAS INTO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS

THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OFFSETTING THESE COSTS WITH THE REVENUE RECEIVED FROM LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS ALSO DEVELOP AND SELL SOFTWARE TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS UNDER THIS MODEL AND WE EXPECT THIS

COMPETITION TO CONTINUE.



OTHER COMPETITORS DEVELOP AND OFFER FREE ONLINE SERVICES AND CONTENT, AND MAKE MONEY BY SELLING THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING. ADVERTISING REVENUES FUND DEVELOPMENT

OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THESE COMPETITORS PROVIDE TO USERS AT NO OR LITTLE COST, COMPETING DIRECTLY WITH OUR REVENUE-GENERATING PRODUCTS.



SOME COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US USING AN OPEN SOURCE BUSINESS MODEL BY MODIFYING AND THEN DISTRIBUTING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AT NOMINAL COST TO END USERS AND

EARNING REVENUE ON ADVERTISING OR COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. THESE FIRMS DO NOT BEAR THE FULL COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE SOFTWARE. SOME OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE VENDORS DEVELOP SOFTWARE THAT MIMICS THE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY

OF OUR PRODUCTS.

THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY RESULT IN DECREASED SALES VOLUMES, PRICE REDUCTIONS,

AND/OR INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, SUCH AS FOR MARKETING AND SALES INCENTIVES. THIS MAY LEAD TO LOWER REVENUE, GROSS MARGINS, AND OPERATING INCOME.

OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON DEVICES AND SERVICES PRESENTS EXECUTION AND COMPETITIVE RISKS.

A GROWING PART OF OUR STRATEGY INVOLVES CLOUD-BASED SERVICES USED WITH SMART CLIENT DEVICES. OUR

COMPETITORS ARE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. PRICING AND DELIVERY MODELS ARE EVOLVING. DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS INFLUENCE HOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD AND IN SOME CASES THE

USERS CHOICE OF WHICH SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO USE. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY OUR OWN COMPETING CLOUD-BASED SOFTWARE PLUS SERVICES STRATEGIES. WHILE WE BELIEVE OUR EXPERTISE, INVESTMENTS IN

INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE BREADTH OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES PROVIDE US WITH A STRONG FOUNDATION TO COMPETE, IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER OUR STRATEGIES WILL ATTRACT THE USERS OR GENERATE THE REVENUE REQUIRED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN ADDITION TO SOFTWARE

DEVELOPMENT COSTS, WE ARE INCURRING COSTS TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES. THESE COSTS MAY REDUCE THE OPERATING MARGINS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY ACHIEVED. WHETHER WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS NEW BUSINESS MODEL

DEPENDS ON OUR EXECUTION IN A NUMBER OF AREAS, INCLUDING.



CONTINUING TO BRING TO MARKET COMPELLING CLOUD-BASED EXPERIENCES THAT GENERATE INCREASING TRAFFIC AND MARKET SHARE;



MAINTAINING THE UTILITY, COMPATIBILITY, AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ON THE GROWING ARRAY OF COMPUTING DEVICES, INCLUDING PCS, SMARTPHONES,

TABLETS, AND TELEVISION-RELATED DEVICES;



CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR CLOUD PLATFORMS TO THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS; AND



ENSURING THAT OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES MEET THE RELIABILITY EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF THEIR DATA.

WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE.

WE WILL CONTINUE

TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM, THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, BING, WINDOWS PHONE, WINDOWS SERVER, THE WINDOWS STORE,

THE WINDOWS AZURE SERVICES PLATFORM, OFFICE 365, OTHER CLOUD-BASED SERVICES OFFERINGS, AND THE XBOX 360 ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM. WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN NEW SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS THE SURFACE

LINE OF MICROSOFT-DESIGNED AND MANUFACTURED DEVICES ANNOUNCED IN JUNE 2012. INVESTMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGY ARE SPECULATIVE. COMMERCIAL SUCCESS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING INNOVATIVENESS, DEVELOPER SUPPORT, AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND

MARKETING. IF CUSTOMERS DO NOT PERCEIVE OUR LATEST OFFERINGS AS PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNCTIONALITY OR OTHER VALUE, THEY MAY REDUCE THEIR PURCHASES OF NEW SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES, UNFAVORABLY IMPACTING REVENUE. WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE

SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE INVESTMENTS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, IF AT ALL. MOREOVER, NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE, AND EVEN IF THEY ARE PROFITABLE, OPERATING MARGINS FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES MAY NOT BE

AS HIGH AS THE MARGINS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORICALLY.

ITEM 1A

IN FALL 2012, WE ARE LAUNCHING WINDOWS 8, A MAJOR NEW RELEASE OF OUR PC OPERATING SYSTEM THAT

SEEKS TO DELIVER A UNIQUE USER EXPERIENCE THROUGH WELL-INTEGRATED SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, AND SERVICES. ITS SUCCESS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH CUSTOMERS EMBRACE ITS NEW USER INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONALITY, SUCCESSFULLY

COORDINATING WITH OUR OEM PARTNERS IN RELEASING A VARIETY OF HARDWARE DEVICES THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF ITS FEATURES, AND ATTRACTING DEVELOPERS AT SCALE TO ENSURE A COMPETITIVE ARRAY OF QUALITY APPLICATIONS. WE EXPECT TO INCUR SUBSTANTIAL MARKETING

COSTS IN LAUNCHING WINDOW 8 AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES AND DEVICES, WHICH MAY REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

PROTECTING OUR GLOBAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND COMBATING UNLICENSED COPYING AND USE OF SOFTWARE AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DIFFICULT. WHILE PIRACY

ADVERSELY AFFECTS U.S. REVENUE, THE IMPACT ON REVENUE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS MORE SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE LAWS ARE LESS PROTECTIVE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. AS A RESULT, OUR REVENUE IN THESE MARKETS MAY GROW SLOWER THAN

THE UNDERLYING PC MARKET. SIMILARLY, THE ABSENCE OF HARMONIZED PATENT LAWS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENSURE CONSISTENT RESPECT FOR PATENT RIGHTS. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WE ACTIVELY EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF LICENSING GENUINE PRODUCTS

AND OBTAINING INDEMNIFICATION BENEFITS FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS, AND WE EDUCATE LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF A BUSINESS CLIMATE WHERE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. HOWEVER, CONTINUED EDUCATIONAL AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS MAY

FAIL TO ENHANCE REVENUE. REDUCTIONS IN THE LEGAL PROTECTION FOR SOFTWARE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUE.

THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, WE RECEIVE NOTICES FROM

OTHERS CLAIMING WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE NUMBER OF THESE CLAIMS MAY GROW BECAUSE OF CONSTANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE COMPETE, THE EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES, AND THE RAPID

RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS. TO RESOLVE THESE CLAIMS WE MAY ENTER INTO ROYALTY AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, STOP SELLING OR REDESIGN AFFECTED PRODUCTS, OR PAY DAMAGES TO SATISFY

INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE OUTCOMES MAY CAUSE OPERATING MARGINS TO DECLINE. IN ADDITION TO MONEY DAMAGES, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS PLAINTIFFS CAN SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT MAY LIMIT OR PREVENT IMPORTING, MARKETING, AND

SELLING OUR PRODUCTS THAT HAVE INFRINGING TECHNOLOGIES. IN SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS GERMANY, AN INJUNCTION CAN BE ISSUED BEFORE THE PARTIES HAVE FULLY LITIGATED THE VALIDITY OF THE UNDERLYING PATENTS. WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE MAKING

SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES TO SETTLE CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND TO PROCURE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO MANAGE THIS RISK.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR SOURCE CODE FROM COPYING IF THERE IS AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE

CODE.

SOURCE CODE, THE DETAILED PROGRAM COMMANDS FOR OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND OTHER SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH WE LICENSE PORTIONS OF OUR APPLICATION AND OPERATING SYSTEM SOURCE CODE TO A

NUMBER OF LICENSEES, WE TAKE SIGNIFICANT MEASURES TO PROTECT THE SECRECY OF LARGE PORTIONS OF OUR SOURCE CODE. IF AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SOURCE CODE OCCURS, WE COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE FUTURE TRADE SECRET PROTECTION

FOR THAT SOURCE CODE. THIS COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR THIRD PARTIES TO COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS BY COPYING FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE CODE ALSO COULD INCREASE THE

SECURITY RISKS DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

CYBER-ATTACKS AND SECURITY VULNERABILITIES COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUE, INCREASED COSTS, LIABILITY

CLAIMS, OR HARM TO OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

SECURITY OF MICROSOFTS INFORMATION

TECHNOLOGY.

MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF COMPUTERS AND COMPUTER NETWORKS IS PARAMOUNT FOR US AND OUR CUSTOMERS. THREATS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SECURITY CAN TAKE A VARIETY OF FORMS. HACKERS DEVELOP AND

DEPLOY VIRUSES, WORMS, AND OTHER MALICIOUS SOFTWARE PROGRAMS THAT ATTACK OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORKS AND DATA CENTERS. GROUPS OF HACKERS MAY ALSO ACT IN A COORDINATED MANNER TO LAUNCH DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE

ATTACKS, OR OTHER COORDINATED ATTACKS. SOPHISTICATED ORGANIZATIONS OR INDIVIDUALS MAY LAUNCH TARGETED ATTACKS USING NOVEL METHODS TO GAIN ACCESS TO COMPUTERS RUNNING OUR SOFTWARE. THESE THREATS MAY RESULT IN BREACHES OF OUR NETWORK OR DATA SECURITY,

DISRUPTIONS OF OUR INTERNAL SYSTEMS AND BUSINESS APPLICATIONS, IMPAIRMENT OF OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DELAYS, HARM TO OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION FROM THE COMPROMISE OF CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION, OR

OTHER NEGATIVE IMPACTS ON OUR BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION, OUR INTERNAL IT ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. OFTEN WE ARE EARLY ADOPTERS OF NEW

DEVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES. WE EMBRACE NEW WAYS OF SHARING DATA AND COMMUNICATING INTERNALLY AND WITH PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS USING METHODS SUCH AS SOCIAL NETWORKING AND OTHER CONSUMER-ORIENTED TECHNOLOGIES. THESE PRACTICES CAN ENHANCE EFFICIENCY AND

BUSINESS INSIGHT, BUT THEY ALSO PRESENT RISKS THAT OUR BUSINESS POLICIES AND INTERNAL SECURITY CONTROLS MAY NOT KEEP PACE WITH THE SPEED OF THESE CHANGES.

SECURITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

.    SECURITY THREATS ARE A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE TO COMPANIES LIKE US WHOSE BUSINESS IS TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE THREATS

TO OUR OWN IT INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS USING OUR CLOUD SERVICES RELY ON THE SECURITY OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENSURE THE RELIABILITY OF OUR SERVICES AND THE PROTECTION OF THEIR DATA. HACKERS TEND TO FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON

THE MOST POPULAR OPERATING SYSTEMS, PROGRAMS, AND SERVICES, INCLUDING MANY OF OURS, AND WE EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO SO. THE SECURITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN OUR CUSTOMERS PURCHASING DECISIONS.

WE DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEFEND AGAINST SECURITY THREATS, BOTH TO OUR INTERNAL IT SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE

INCLUDE.



ENGINEERING MORE SECURE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;



ENHANCING SECURITY AND RELIABILITY FEATURES IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATING AND UPDATING THOSE SECURITY AND RELIABILITY FEATURES;



IMPROVING THE DEPLOYMENT OF SOFTWARE UPDATES TO ADDRESS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES;



INVESTING IN MITIGATION TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP TO SECURE CUSTOMERS FROM ATTACKS EVEN WHEN SUCH SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE NOT DEPLOYED;



PROTECTING THE DIGITAL SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ENSURES THE INTEGRITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;



HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS MAKE THE BEST USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO PROTECT AGAINST COMPUTER VIRUSES AND OTHER ATTACKS; AND



PROVIDING CUSTOMERS ONLINE AUTOMATED SECURITY TOOLS, PUBLISHED SECURITY GUIDANCE, AND SECURITY SOFTWARE SUCH AS FIREWALLS AND ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE.

THE COST OF THESE STEPS COULD REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED SECURITY

VULNERABILITIES IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM AND LEAD SOME CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE OR DELAY FUTURE PURCHASES OF PRODUCTS OR SUBSCRIPTIONS TO SERVICES, OR TO USE COMPETING PRODUCTS. CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO INCREASE

THEIR EXPENDITURES ON PROTECTING THEIR EXISTING COMPUTER SYSTEMS FROM ATTACK, WHICH COULD DELAY ADOPTION OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. ANY OF THESE ACTIONS BY CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED VULNERABILITIES

MAY LEAD TO CLAIMS AGAINST US. ALTHOUGH OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE OR LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO SUCH LIABILITY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THESE PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND ALL LEGAL CHALLENGES. LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY

ACTION MAY INCREASE THE COSTS TO DEVELOP OR IMPLEMENT OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA COULD RESULT

IN LIABILITY AND HARM OUR REPUTATION.

AS WE CONTINUE TO EXECUTE OUR STRATEGY OF INCREASING THE NUMBER AND SCALE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED OFFERINGS, WE STORE AND PROCESS INCREASINGLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE

INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE CONTINUED OCCURRENCE OF HIGH-PROFILE DATA BREACHES PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF AN EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO INFORMATION SECURITY. THIS ENVIRONMENT DEMANDS THAT WE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE

OUR DESIGN AND COORDINATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS ACROSS OUR BUSINESS GROUPS AND GEOGRAPHIES. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, IT IS POSSIBLE OUR SECURITY CONTROLS OVER PERSONAL DATA, OUR TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES AND VENDORS ON DATA SECURITY, AND OTHER PRACTICES

WE FOLLOW MAY NOT PREVENT THE IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT WE OR OUR VENDORS STORE AND MANAGE. IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF THIS INFORMATION COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION, LEAD TO LEGAL EXPOSURE TO CUSTOMERS, OR SUBJECT US

TO LIABILITY UNDER LAWS THAT PROTECT PERSONAL DATA, RESULTING IN INCREASED COSTS OR LOSS OF REVENUE. OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALSO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO STORE AND PROCESS PERSONAL DATA ON PREMISE OR, INCREASINGLY, IN A CLOUD-BASED

ENVIRONMENT WE HOST. WE BELIEVE CONSUMERS USING OUR EMAIL, MESSAGING, STORAGE, SHARING, AND SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES WILL INCREASINGLY WANT EFFICIENT, CENTRALIZED METHODS OF CHOOSING THEIR PRIVACY PREFERENCES AND CONTROLLING THEIR DATA.

PERCEPTIONS THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE

17

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1A

PRIVACY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COULD INHIBIT SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND COULD CONSTRAIN CONSUMER AND BUSINESS ADOPTION OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS.

WE MAY EXPERIENCE OUTAGES, DATA LOSSES, AND DISRUPTIONS OF OUR ONLINE SERVICES IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE OPERATIONS

INFRASTRUCTURE.

OUR INCREASING USER TRAFFIC AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DEMAND MORE COMPUTING POWER. WE HAVE SPENT AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS TO PURCHASE OR LEASE DATA CENTERS AND

EQUIPMENT AND TO UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TO HANDLE INCREASED TRAFFIC ON OUR WEBSITES AND IN OUR DATA CENTERS, AND TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND SUPPORT EXISTING SERVICES SUCH AS BING, EXCHANGE ONLINE, OFFICE

365, SHAREPOINT ONLINE, SKYPE, XBOX LIVE, WINDOWS AZURE, WINDOWS LIVE, AND MICROSOFT OFFICE WEB APPS. WE ALSO ARE GROWING OUR BUSINESS OF PROVIDING A PLATFORM AND BACK-END HOSTING FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY BUSINESSES TO THEIR END

CUSTOMERS. MAINTAINING AND EXPANDING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS EXPENSIVE AND COMPLEX. INEFFICIENCIES OR OPERATIONAL FAILURES, INCLUDING TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT LOSS OF CUSTOMER DATA, COULD DIMINISH THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND USER

EXPERIENCE RESULTING IN CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY, CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND LOSS OF CURRENT AND POTENTIAL USERS, SUBSCRIBERS, AND ADVERTISERS, EACH OF WHICH MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIVITY THAT AFFECTS HOW WE DESIGN AND MARKET OUR

PRODUCTS.

AS A LEADING GLOBAL SOFTWARE MAKER, WE RECEIVE CLOSE SCRUTINY FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES UNDER U.S. AND FOREIGN COMPETITION LAWS. SOME JURISDICTIONS ALSO PROVIDE PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION FOR COMPETITORS OR

CONSUMERS TO ASSERT CLAIMS OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS.

LAWSUITS BROUGHT

BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 18 STATES, AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN TWO SEPARATE ACTIONS WERE RESOLVED THROUGH A CONSENT DECREE THAT TOOK EFFECT IN 2001 AND A FINAL JUDGMENT ENTERED IN 2002. THESE PROCEEDINGS IMPOSED VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS ON

OUR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM BUSINESSES. THESE CONSTRAINTS INCLUDED LIMITS ON CERTAIN CONTRACTING PRACTICES, MANDATED DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE PROGRAM INTERFACES AND PROTOCOLS, AND RIGHTS FOR COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS TO LIMIT THE VISIBILITY OF

CERTAIN WINDOWS FEATURES IN NEW PCS. ALTHOUGH THE CONSENT DECREE AND FINAL JUDGMENT EXPIRED IN MAY 2011, WE EXPECT THAT FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES WILL CONTINUE TO CLOSELY SCRUTINIZE OUR BUSINESS.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION CLOSELY SCRUTINIZES THE DESIGN OF HIGH-VOLUME MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND THE TERMS ON WHICH WE MAKE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES USED

IN THESE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS FILE FORMATS, PROGRAMMING INTERFACES, AND PROTOCOLS, AVAILABLE TO OTHER COMPANIES. IN 2004, THE COMMISSION ORDERED US TO CREATE NEW VERSIONS OF WINDOWS THAT DO NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN MULTIMEDIA TECHNOLOGIES AND TO PROVIDE OUR

COMPETITORS WITH SPECIFICATIONS FOR HOW TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN PROPRIETARY WINDOWS COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS IN THEIR OWN PRODUCTS. IN 2009, THE COMMISSION ACCEPTED A SET OF COMMITMENTS OFFERED BY MICROSOFT TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSIONS CONCERNS

RELATING TO COMPETITION IN WEB BROWSING SOFTWARE. THE COMMISSIONS IMPACT ON PRODUCT DESIGN MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO INNOVATE IN WINDOWS OR OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE, DIMINISH THE DEVELOPER APPEAL OF THE WINDOWS PLATFORM, AND INCREASE OUR

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. THE AVAILABILITY OF LICENSES RELATED TO PROTOCOLS AND FILE FORMATS MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT BETTER MIMIC THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR OWN PRODUCTS WHICH COULD RESULT IN DECREASED SALES OF

OUR PRODUCTS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATORY ACTIONS AND COURT DECISIONS SUCH AS THESE MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE BENEFITS OF

OUR SOFTWARE TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, THEREBY REDUCING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE REVENUE THAT COME FROM THEM. NEW ACTIONS COULD BE INITIATED AT ANY TIME, EITHER BY THESE OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS OR PRIVATE CLAIMANTS, INCLUDING WITH

RESPECT TO NEW VERSIONS OF WINDOWS OR OTHER MICROSOFT PRODUCTS. THE OUTCOME OF SUCH ACTIONS, OR STEPS TAKEN TO AVOID THEM, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING.



WE MAY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WITHDRAWING PRODUCTS FROM CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES TO AVOID FINES OR DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS OF THOSE PRODUCTS

TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT RULINGS, WHICH MAY ENTAIL A DELAY IN A PRODUCT RELEASE AND REMOVING FUNCTIONALITY THAT CUSTOMERS WANT OR ON WHICH DEVELOPERS RELY.



WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE AVAILABLE LICENSES TO OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES ON TERMS THAT DO NOT REFLECT THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE OR DO NOT PROTECT OUR

ASSOCIATED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.



THE RULINGS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY BE USED AS PRECEDENT IN OTHER COMPETITION LAW PROCEEDINGS.

ITEM 1A



WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF ONGOING COMMITMENTS AS A RESULT OF COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS, CONSENT DECREES OR OTHER VOLUNTARY ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN. IF

WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESE COMMITMENTS WE MAY INCUR LITIGATION COSTS AND BE SUBJECT TO FINES OR OTHER REMEDIAL ACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN JULY 2012 WE ANNOUNCED THAT, FOR SOME PCS SOLD IN EUROPE, WE WERE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR 2009 AGREEMENT TO

DISPLAY A BROWSER CHOICE SCREEN ON WINDOWS PCS WHERE INTERNET EXPLORER IS THE DEFAULT BROWSER.

OUR

PRODUCTS AND ONLINE SERVICES OFFERINGS, INCLUDING NEW TECHNOLOGIES WE DEVELOP OR ACQUIRE SUCH AS SKYPE, ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING IN AREAS OF USER PRIVACY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, DATA PROTECTION, AND ONLINE

CONTENT. THE APPLICATION OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO OUR BUSINESS IS OFTEN UNCLEAR, SUBJECT TO CHANGE OVER TIME, AND SOMETIMES MAY CONFLICT FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ADDITIONALLY THESE LAWS AND GOVERNMENTS APPROACH TO THEIR

ENFORCEMENT, AS WELL AS OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ARE CONTINUING TO EVOLVE. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE TYPES OF REGULATION MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT COSTS OR REQUIRE CHANGES IN PRODUCTS OR BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE. NONCOMPLIANCE

COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES BEING IMPOSED ON US OR ORDERS THAT WE STOP THE ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANT ACTIVITY.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR

ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESS IS BASED ON SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENTED EMPLOYEES. THE MARKET FOR HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS AND LEADERS IN OUR INDUSTRY IS EXTREMELY

COMPETITIVE. WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT INTERNATIONALLY BY RESTRICTIVE DOMESTIC IMMIGRATION LAWS. IF WE ARE LESS SUCCESSFUL IN OUR RECRUITING EFFORTS, OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER

SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. EFFECTIVE SUCCESSION PLANNING IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS. FAILURE TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE AND SMOOTH TRANSITIONS INVOLVING KEY EMPLOYEES COULD HINDER OUR

STRATEGIC PLANNING AND EXECUTION.

DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR

REVENUE.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS A COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS. NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS CAN REQUIRE LONG DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PERIODS. OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON

CLOUD-BASED SOFTWARE PLUS SERVICES ALSO PRESENTS NEW AND COMPLEX DEVELOPMENT ISSUES. SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE RELEASES OR SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN CREATING NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE.

OUR GROWTH DEPENDS ON OUR

ABILITY TO CREATE NEW AND HIGHER VALUE PRODUCT AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE WINDOWS PC OPERATING

SYSTEM, THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, BING, WINDOWS PHONE, WINDOWS SERVER, THE WINDOWS STORE, THE WINDOWS AZURE SERVICES PLATFORM, OFFICE 365, OTHER CLOUD-BASED SERVICES OFFERINGS, AND THE XBOX 360 ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM. IN JUNE 2012, WE ANNOUNCED

THE SURFACE LINE OF MICROSOFT-DESIGNED AND MANUFACTURED DEVICES. WE WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO INVEST IN NEW SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES. INVESTMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGY ARE SPECULATIVE. COMMERCIAL SUCCESS DEPENDS ON MANY

FACTORS, INCLUDING INNOVATIVENESS, DEVELOPER SUPPORT, AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING. OUR DEGREE OF SUCCESS WITH WINDOWS PHONE, FOR EXAMPLE, WILL IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GROW OUR SHARE OF THE SMARTPHONE OPERATING SYSTEM MARKET. IT WILL ALSO

BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN SUPPORTING OUR STRATEGY OF DELIVERING VALUE TO END USERS SEAMLESSLY OVER A VARIETY OF FORM FACTORS INCLUDING PC, PHONE, AND TV DEVICE CLASSES. IF CUSTOMERS DO NOT PERCEIVE OUR LATEST OFFERINGS AS PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT NEW

FUNCTIONALITY OR OTHER VALUE, THEY MAY REDUCE THEIR PURCHASES OF NEW SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES, UNFAVORABLY IMPACTING REVENUE. WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE INVESTMENTS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, IF AT ALL.

MOREOVER, NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE, AND EVEN IF THEY ARE PROFITABLE, OPERATING MARGINS FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES MAY NOT BE AS HIGH AS THE MARGINS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORICALLY.

ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS.

UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INFLATION,

RECESSION, OR OTHER CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MAY RESULT IN LOWER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SPENDING AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. IF DEMAND FOR PCS, SERVERS, AND OTHER COMPUTING DEVICES DECLINES, OR CONSUMER OR BUSINESS SPENDING FOR THOSE

PRODUCTS DECLINES, OUR REVENUE WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. OUR PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ALSO RELIES ON AN EXTENSIVE PARTNER AND RETAIL NETWORK. ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS) BUILDING DEVICES THAT RUN OUR SOFTWARE HAVE ALSO

BEEN A SIGNIFICANT MEANS OF DISTRIBUTION. THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON OUR PARTNERS, SUCH AS THE BANKRUPTCY OF A MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR, OEM, OR RETAILER, COULD RESULT IN SALES CHANNEL DISRUPTION. CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ALSO MAY IMPAIR

THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR PRODUCTS AND

19

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1A

SERVICES THEY HAVE PURCHASED. AS A RESULT, ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND WRITE-OFFS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MAY INCREASE. WE MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS HOLDINGS, TYPES, AND

MATURITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO GENERAL CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, MARKET, AND INTEREST RATE RISKS, WHICH MAY BE EXACERBATED BY UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT HAVE AFFECTED GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTS

OF U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. IF GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS EXPERIENCE PROLONGED PERIODS OF DECLINE, OR IF THERE IS A DOWNGRADE OF U.S. GOVERNMENT DEBT, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AND WE COULD DETERMINE THAT MORE OF

OUR INVESTMENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE, REQUIRING IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE HAVE CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AGAINST US THAT MAY RESULT IN ADVERSE OUTCOMES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS. ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN SOME OR ALL OF THESE CLAIMS MAY

RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES RESOLVING ALL OF THESE MATTERS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE LITIGATION AND OTHER CLAIMS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

ALSO COULD OCCUR FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECT OF AN UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOME BECOMES PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

WE

MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S. AND MANY FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IN THE ORDINARY

COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN. WE REGULARLY ARE UNDER AUDIT BY TAX AUTHORITIES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF

TAX AUDITS AND ANY RELATED LITIGATION COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. THE RESULTS OF AN AUDIT OR LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR

WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE.

WE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING INCOME FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND ANY REPATRIATION OF

FUNDS CURRENTLY HELD IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS TO THE U.S. MAY RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS TO CHANGE U.S. TAX LAWS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT HOW U.S. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS

ARE TAXED ON FOREIGN EARNINGS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OR IN WHAT FORM ANY PROPOSED LEGISLATION MAY PASS, IF ENACTED IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR TAX EXPENSE AND CASH FLOW.

OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR SUPPLY PROBLEMS.

OUR VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE

PRODUCTS SUCH AS THE XBOX 360 CONSOLE, SURFACE DEVICES, AND OTHER HARDWARE DEVICES WE DESIGN AND MARKET ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND CAN HAVE DEFECTS IN DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, OR ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE. WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, LOST REVENUE, AND

REPUTATIONAL HARM IF WE FAIL TO DETECT OR EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES THROUGH DESIGN, TESTING, OR WARRANTY REPAIRS. WE OBTAIN SOME COMPONENTS OF OUR HARDWARE DEVICES FROM SOLE SUPPLIERS. OUR COMPETITORS USE SOME OF THE SAME SUPPLIERS AND THEIR

DEMAND FOR HARDWARE COMPONENTS CAN AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CAPACITY AVAILABLE TO US. IF A COMPONENT DELIVERY FROM A SOLE-SOURCE SUPPLIER IS DELAYED OR BECOMES UNAVAILABLE OR INDUSTRY SHORTAGES OCCUR, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN TIMELY REPLACEMENT

SUPPLIES, RESULTING IN REDUCED SALES. EITHER COMPONENT SHORTAGES OR EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE. XBOX 360 CONSOLES ARE ASSEMBLED IN ASIA; DISRUPTIONS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN MAY RESULT IN CONSOLE SHORTAGES THAT WOULD

AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. THESE SAME RISKS WOULD APPLY TO ANY OTHER VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE MAY OFFER.

OUR STAND-ALONE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS MAY ALSO EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR RELIABILITY PROBLEMS. THE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE DEVELOP MAY CONTAIN BUGS AND OTHER DEFECTS THAT INTERFERE WITH THEIR INTENDED

OPERATION. ANY DEFECTS WE DO NOT DETECT AND FIX IN PRE-RELEASE TESTING COULD RESULT IN REDUCED SALES AND REVENUE, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION, REPAIR OR REMEDIATION COSTS, DELAYS IN THE RELEASE OF NEW PRODUCTS OR VERSIONS, OR LEGAL LIABILITY. ALTHOUGH

OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE OR LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO LIABILITY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THESE PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND LEGAL CHALLENGE.

IF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME IMPAIRED WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO EARNINGS.

WE ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES AND MAY NOT REALIZE ALL THE

ECONOMIC BENEFIT FROM THOSE ACQUISITIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLES. UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S. GAAP), WE REVIEW OUR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR

IMPAIRMENT WHEN

20

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1A

EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. FACTORS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES,

INDICATING THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, INCLUDE A DECLINE IN STOCK PRICE AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION, REDUCED FUTURE CASH FLOW ESTIMATES, AND SLOWER GROWTH RATES IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE

MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH ANY IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS DETERMINED, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN JULY

2012, WE ANNOUNCED A $6.2 BILLION CHARGE FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN OUR ONLINE SERVICES DIVISION BUSINESS SEGMENT.

WE OPERATE

A GLOBAL BUSINESS THAT EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS.

WE OPERATE IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES AND A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES. PRESSURE TO MAKE OUR PRICING STRUCTURE UNIFORM MIGHT REQUIRE

THAT WE REDUCE THE SALES PRICE OF OUR SOFTWARE IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TRADE PROTECTION LAWS, POLICIES AND MEASURES, AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT,

INCLUDING THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND LOCAL LAWS PROHIBITING CORRUPT PAYMENTS BY OUR EMPLOYEES, VENDORS, OR AGENTS. EMERGING MARKETS ARE A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL GROWTH STRATEGY. THE DEVELOPING NATURE OF THESE MARKETS

PRESENTS A NUMBER OF RISKS. DETERIORATION OF SOCIAL, POLITICAL, LABOR, OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION, SUCH AS CURRENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO EUROPEAN SOVEREIGN AND OTHER DEBT, AND DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING

FOREIGN OPERATIONS, MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. ALTHOUGH WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY EXPOSURE, SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUE.

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR GEO-POLITICAL CONDITIONS MAY DISRUPT OUR

BUSINESS.

A DISRUPTION OR FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEMS OR OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE, WEATHER EVENT, CYBER-ATTACK, TERRORIST ATTACK, OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENT COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN COMPLETING SALES, PROVIDING

SERVICES, OR PERFORMING OTHER MISSION-CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN THE SEATTLE, WASHINGTON AREA, AND

WE HAVE OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF CALIFORNIA, BOTH OF WHICH ARE NEAR MAJOR EARTHQUAKE FAULTS. A CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT RESULTS IN THE DESTRUCTION OR DISRUPTION OF ANY OF OUR CRITICAL BUSINESS OR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

SYSTEMS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. OUR MOVE TOWARD PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH MORE SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS IN THE CLOUD PUTS A PREMIUM ON THE RESILIENCE OF OUR SYSTEMS AND STRENGTH OF OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY

MANAGEMENT PLANS, AND MAGNIFIES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PROLONGED SERVICE OUTAGES ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS. ABRUPT POLITICAL CHANGE, TERRORIST ACTIVITY, AND ARMED CONFLICT POSE A RISK OF GENERAL ECONOMIC DISRUPTION IN AFFECTED COUNTRIES, WHICH MAY

INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. THESE CONDITIONS ALSO MAY ADD UNCERTAINTY TO THE TIMING AND BUDGET FOR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT DECISIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS, AND MAY RESULT IN SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS FOR HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS, EITHER OF WHICH MAY

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IN GENERAL OR THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR ARE UNCLEAR. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY, DEMAND OR AVAILABLE SOURCES

OF ENERGY MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING NATURAL RESOURCES, NECESSARY TO RUN OUR BUSINESS. CHANGES IN WEATHER WHERE WE OPERATE MAY INCREASE THE COSTS OF POWERING AND COOLING COMPUTER HARDWARE WE USE TO DEVELOP

SOFTWARE AND PROVIDE CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. NEW REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO FIND ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANT AND COST-EFFECTIVE METHODS OF DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE MAKING ACQUISITIONS OR ENTERING INTO JOINT VENTURES AND STRATEGIC

ALLIANCES AS PART OF OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS STRATEGY. THESE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS INCLUDING THAT THE TRANSACTION DOES NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, THAT WE DO NOT REALIZE A SATISFACTORY RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT,

OR THAT WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY, OR DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM OUR OTHER BUSINESSES. OUR RECENT ACQUISITION OF SKYPE, FOR EXAMPLE, PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE OUR

EXISTING PRODUCTS. THE SUCCESS OF OUR INTEGRATION OF SKYPE WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE COMPELLING EXPERIENCES THAT DISTINGUISH US FROM OUR COMPETITORS IN BOTH CONSUMER AND BUSINESS MARKETS. IT MAY TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO

REALIZE THE FULL BENEFITS FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS INCREASED REVENUE, ENHANCED EFFICIENCIES, OR MARKET SHARE, OR THOSE BENEFITS MAY ULTIMATELY BE SMALLER THAN ANTICIPATED OR MAY NOT BE REALIZED. THESE EVENTS COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS

OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) IS

INTENDED TO HELP THE READER UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION. MD&A IS PROVIDED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES

TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

MICROSOFT IS A TECHNOLOGY LEADER FOCUSED ON HELPING PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD REALIZE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. WE CREATE TECHNOLOGY THAT TRANSFORMS THE WAY PEOPLE WORK, PLAY, AND COMMUNICATE ACROSS A

WIDE RANGE OF COMPUTING DEVICES.

WE GENERATE REVENUE BY DEVELOPING, LICENSING, AND SUPPORTING A WIDE RANGE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES, INCLUDING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES, BY DESIGNING AND SELLING HARDWARE, AND BY DELIVERING RELEVANT ONLINE ADVERTISING TO A GLOBAL AUDIENCE. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES ARE RELATED TO COMPENSATING EMPLOYEES, DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING,

MARKETING, AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND INCOME TAXES.

INDUSTRY TRENDS

OUR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH FREQUENT CHANGES IN BOTH TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS. EACH INDUSTRY SHIFT IS AN

OPPORTUNITY TO CONCEIVE NEW PRODUCTS, NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OR NEW IDEAS THAT CAN FURTHER TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS. AT MICROSOFT, WE PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE THROUGH A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT

SEEK TO ANTICIPATE THE CHANGING DEMANDS OF CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRY TRENDS, AND COMPETITIVE FORCES.

KEY OPPORTUNITIES AND INVESTMENTS

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND OUR BROAD FOCUS ON LONG-TERM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE SEE

SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE FUTURE GROWTH.

SMART CONNECTED DEVICES

THE PRICE PER UNIT OF PROCESSING, STORAGE, AND NETWORKS CONTINUES TO DECLINE WHILE AT THE SAME TIME DEVICES INCREASE IN CAPABILITY. AS A RESULT,

THE CAPABILITIES AND ACCESSIBILITY OF PCS, TABLETS, PHONES, TELEVISIONS, AND OTHER DEVICES POWERED BY RICH SOFTWARE PLATFORMS AND APPLICATIONS CONTINUE TO GROW. AT THE SAME TIME, THE INFORMATION AND SERVICES PEOPLE USE INCREASINGLY SPAN MULTIPLE

DEVICES ENABLED BY THE ADOPTION OF CLOUD COMPUTING.

FOR EXAMPLE, THE DELIVERY AND QUALITY OF UNIFIED ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCES ACROSS

DEVICES IS UNDERGOING DRAMATIC EVOLUTION. THESE RICH MEDIA EXPERIENCES INCLUDE BOOKS, MAGAZINES, NEWSPAPERS, GAMES, MOVIES, MUSIC, TELEVISION, AND SOCIAL INTERACTIONS WITH FAMILY, FRIENDS, AND COLLEAGUES. AT MICROSOFT, OUR APPROACH IS TO SIMPLIFY

AND INCREASE THE ACCESSIBILITY OF THESE ENTERTAINMENT EXPERIENCES TO BROADEN MARKET PENETRATION OF OUR SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, AND SERVICES.

ADDITIONALLY, WEB CONTENT AND SOCIAL CONNECTIONS HAVE INCREASED TREMENDOUSLY AS PEOPLE SPEND MORE TIME ONLINE, WHILE DISCOVERABILITY AND

ACCESSIBILITY HAS BEEN TRANSFORMING FROM DIRECT NAVIGATION AND DOCUMENT LINKS. THERE IS SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITY TO DELIVER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT HELP USERS MAKE FASTER, BETTER DECISIONS AND COMPLETE TASKS MORE SIMPLY WHEN USING THEIR DEVICES.

OUR APPROACH IS TO USE MACHINE LEARNING TO UNDERSTAND USER INTENT, AND DIFFERENTIATE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BY FOCUSING ON THE INTEGRATION OF SPEECH, VISUAL, SOCIAL, AND OTHER ELEMENTS TO SIMPLIFY PEOPLES INTERACTION WITH THE INTERNET.

WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN ENABLING AND DEVELOPING SMART CONNECTED DEVICES THAT OFFER A UNIFIED, SEAMLESS EXPERIENCE ACROSS A

COMMON PLATFORM. WHETHER A PC, WINDOWS PHONE, XBOX 360, OR THE NEWLY ANNOUNCED SURFACE

DEVICES, OUR GOAL IS TO PROVIDE USERS WITH A CONSISTENT AND COMPELLING EXPERIENCE THROUGH A COMMON USER INTERFACE AND OUR SERVICES SUCH AS SKYDRIVE, XBOX LIVE, BING, SKYPE, AND OUR WINDOWS AZURE

CLOUD PLATFORM.

COMMUNICATIONS AND PRODUCTIVITY

THE UBIQUITY OF COMPUTING AND SOFTWARE TOOLS HAS TRANSFORMED PERSONAL AND BUSINESS PRODUCTIVITY. OVER THE LAST DECADE, MICROSOFT REDEFINED SOFTWARE PRODUCTIVITY BEYOND THE RICH OFFICE CLIENT ON THE PC. PRODUCTIVITY

SCENARIOS NOW ENCOMPASS UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS SUCH AS INSTANT MESSAGING, VOICE, AND VIDEO COMMUNICATIONS, BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE, COLLABORATION, CONTENT MANAGEMENT, AND RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT, ALL OF WHICH ARE INCREASINGLY AVAILABLE THROUGH

SERVER-SIDE APPLICATIONS. THESE SERVER APPLICATIONS CAN BE HOSTED IN THE CLOUD BY THE CUSTOMER, A PARTNER, OR BY MICROSOFT. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO BRING TO LIFE PRODUCTIVITY AND COMMUNICATION SCENARIOS ACROSS PCS, MOBILE, AND OTHER

DEVICES THAT CONNECT TO SERVICES. WE INVEST SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT MAKE THIS POSSIBLE  DYNAMICS, EXCHANGE, LYNC, SKYPE, OFFICE, OFFICE 365, SHAREPOINT, WINDOWS LIVE, AND WINDOWS PHONE.

CLOUD COMPUTING TRANSFORMING THE DATA CENTER AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND CONTENT OVER THE INTERNET BY WAY OF SHARED COMPUTING RESOURCES LOCATED IN CENTRALIZED DATA CENTERS. COMPUTING IS UNDERGOING A LONG-TERM SHIFT

FROM CLIENT/SERVER TO THE CLOUD, A SHIFT SIMILAR IN IMPORTANCE AND IMPACT TO THE TRANSITION FROM MAINFRAME TO CLIENT/SERVER. THE SHIFT TO THE CLOUD IS DRIVEN BY THREE IMPORTANT ECONOMIES OF SCALE: LARGER DATA CENTERS CAN DEPLOY COMPUTATIONAL

RESOURCES AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST PER UNIT THAN SMALLER ONES; LARGER DATA CENTERS CAN COORDINATE AND AGGREGATE DIVERSE CUSTOMER, GEOGRAPHIC, AND APPLICATION DEMAND PATTERNS IMPROVING THE UTILIZATION OF COMPUTING, STORAGE, AND NETWORK RESOURCES;

AND MULTI-TENANCY LOWERS APPLICATION MAINTENANCE LABOR COSTS FOR LARGE PUBLIC CLOUDS. BECAUSE OF THE IMPROVED ECONOMICS, THE CLOUD OFFERS UNIQUE LEVELS OF ELASTICITY AND AGILITY THAT ENABLES NEW SOLUTIONS AND APPLICATIONS. FOR BUSINESSES OF ALL

SIZES, THE CLOUD CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON INNOVATION WHILE LEAVING NON-DIFFERENTIATING ACTIVITIES TO RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROVIDERS. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOPING CLOUD INFRASTRUCTURE, PLATFORMS, AND

APPLICATIONS INCLUDING OFFERINGS SUCH AS MICROSOFT DYNAMICS ONLINE, MICROSOFT SQL AZURE, OFFICE 365, WINDOWS AZURE, WINDOWS INTUNE, AND WINDOWS SERVER.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES, AND RISKS

AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, OUR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE MUST ANTICIPATE CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY AND BUSINESS MODELS. OUR MODEL FOR

GROWTH IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO INITIATE AND EMBRACE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, TO ENTER NEW MARKETS, BOTH IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCT AREAS, AND TO DRIVE BROAD ADOPTION OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE DEVELOP AND MARKET.

AT MICROSOFT, WE PRIORITIZE OUR INVESTMENTS AMONG THE HIGHEST LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND

ARE MULTI-YEAR IN NATURE. THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE BRING TO MARKET MAY BE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY, BROUGHT TO MARKET AS PART OF A PARTNERSHIP OR ALLIANCE, OR THROUGH ACQUISITION.

OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. WE HIRE A MIX OF UNIVERSITY AND INDUSTRY TALENT

WORLDWIDE. MICROSOFT COMPETES FOR TALENTED INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE BY OFFERING BROAD CUSTOMER REACH, SCALE IN RESOURCES, AND COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION.

DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND HARDWARE HAS A STRONG CORRELATION TO GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC FACTORS. THE CURRENT MACROECONOMIC FACTORS REMAIN DYNAMIC. SEE A DISCUSSION OF THESE FACTORS AND OTHER RISKS UNDER

RISK FACTORS (PART II, ITEM 1A. OF THIS FORM 10-K).

SEASONALITY

OUR REVENUE HISTORICALLY HAS FLUCTUATED QUARTERLY AND HAS GENERALLY BEEN THE HIGHEST IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR DUE TO CORPORATE CALENDAR YEAR-END SPENDING TRENDS IN OUR MAJOR MARKETS AND HOLIDAY

SEASON SPENDING

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND

CREDIT; TO ENHANCE INVESTMENT RETURNS; AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE). THESE ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES IN THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011

DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST INCOME DECREASED DUE TO LOWER YIELDS ON OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER AVERAGE PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT BALANCES. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO OUR INCREASED ISSUANCE

ON COMMODITY AND EQUITY DERIVATIVES IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AS COMPARED WITH GAINS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, OFFSET IN PART BY FEWER LOSSES ON FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS IN THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR AS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. CHANGES IN

INCOME TAXES

FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011 WERE APPROXIMATELY 24% AND 18%, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE LOWER THAN THE

U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO

RICO, WHICH HAVE LOWER INCOME TAX RATES.

OUR FISCAL YEAR 2012 EFFECTIVE RATE INCREASED BY 6% FROM FISCAL YEAR 2011 MAINLY DUE TO A

NONRECURRING $6.2 BILLION NON-TAX DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE THAT WAS RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE INCREASED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 10%. IN ADDITION, IN FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011, WE

RECOGNIZED A REDUCTION OF 21% AND 16%, RESPECTIVELY, TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DUE TO FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES. IN FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE SETTLED A PORTION OF AN I.R.S. AUDIT OF TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006, WHICH REDUCED OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE

FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011 BY $461 MILLION AND REDUCED THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 2%.

CHANGES IN THE MIX OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN

THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES ALSO IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE, WINDOWS DIVISION OPERATING

INCOME DECLINED $751 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2012, WHILE MBD AND SERVER AND TOOLS OPERATING INCOME INCREASED $1.1 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THIS SAME PERIOD. WE SUPPLY WINDOWS, OUR PRIMARY WINDOWS DIVISION PRODUCT, TO CUSTOMERS

THROUGH OUR U.S. REGIONAL OPERATING CENTER, WHILE WE SUPPLY THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, OUR PRIMARY MBD PRODUCT, AND OUR SERVER AND TOOLS PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS. IN FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011, OUR U.S.

INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $1.6 BILLION AND $8.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 7% AND 32%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011, THE FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $20.7 BILLION AND $19.2

BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 93% AND 68%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE DECREASE IN THE U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX IN FISCAL YEAR 2012 WAS THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE.

TAX CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER TAX LIABILITIES WERE $7.6 BILLION AND $7.4 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012 AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN

OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. WHILE WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S. AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REMAIN UNDER AUDIT FOR THESE YEARS. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE I.R.S. WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS

REPORT AND REOPENED THE AUDIT PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE BELIEVE OUR

ALLOWANCES FOR TAX CONTINGENCIES ARE APPROPRIATE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, AS WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE REMAINING

OPEN ISSUES WILL BE RESOLVED WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2011.

FISCAL YEAR 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2010

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010 WERE APPROXIMATELY 18% AND 25%, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE AND OUR PRIOR YEAR EFFECTIVE RATE PRIMARILY

DUE TO A HIGHER MIX OF EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO, WHICH HAVE

LOWER INCOME TAX RATES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010, OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $8.9 BILLION AND $9.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 32% AND 38%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2011

AND 2010, THE FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $19.2 BILLION AND $15.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 68% AND 62%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2011 AND 2010, THE REDUCTION OF THE U.S. FEDERAL

STATUTORY RATE AS A RESULT OF FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES WAS 16% AND 12%, RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION, OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN IN THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO A PARTIAL SETTLEMENT

WITH THE I.R.S. IN THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011 RELATING TO THE AUDIT OF TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006. THIS PARTIAL SETTLEMENT REDUCED OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011 BY $461 MILLION.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

CASH, CASH

EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALED $63.0 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012,

COMPARED WITH $52.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2011. EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE $9.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, COMPARED WITH $10.9 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2011. OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY TO FACILITATE LIQUIDITY AND

FOR CAPITAL PRESERVATION. THEY CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. THE INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO

INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SECURITIES IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY RISK. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE

ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME INDICES. THE SETTLEMENT RISK RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS INSIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD ARE PRIMARILY HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. WHILE

WE OWN CERTAIN MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, OUR PORTFOLIO AS OF JUNE 30, 2012 DOES NOT CONTAIN DIRECT EXPOSURE TO SUBPRIME MORTGAGES OR STRUCTURED VEHICLES THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM SUBPRIME COLLATERAL. THE

MAJORITY OF OUR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY PRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND CARRY A 100% PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST GUARANTEE, PRIMARILY FROM FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION, AND

GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION.

WE ROUTINELY MONITOR OUR FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO BOTH SOVEREIGN AND NON-SOVEREIGN BORROWERS AND

COUNTERPARTIES. OUR GROSS EXPOSURES TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND INVESTMENTS IN PORTUGAL, ITALY, IRELAND, GREECE, AND SPAIN ARE INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY NOT MATERIAL.

OF THE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AT JUNE 30, 2012, APPROXIMATELY $54 BILLION WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL REPATRIATION TAX EFFECTS. THE AMOUNT

OF CASH AND INVESTMENTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREE FLOW OF FUNDS (PRIMARILY CURRENCY AND OTHER LOCAL REGULATORY) WAS APPROXIMATELY $660 MILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, APPROXIMATELY 77% OF THE

SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE INVESTED IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, APPROXIMATELY 10% WERE INVESTED IN CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS OF U.S. COMPANIES, AND 3% WERE INVESTED IN U.S. MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES,

ALL OF WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS.

SECURITIES LENDING

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS

COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. OUR SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE

BALANCE WAS $814 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012. OUR AVERAGE AND MAXIMUM SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WERE $1.2 BILLION AND $1.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INTRA-YEAR VARIANCES IN THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES LOANED ARE MAINLY

DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DEMAND FOR THE SECURITIES.

VALUATION

IN GENERAL, AND WHERE APPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 1

INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS EXCHANGE-TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND U.S. TREASURIES. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, THEN WE USE QUOTED PRICES

FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR INPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS SUCH AS CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENT

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

BONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AND AGENCY SECURITIES. LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS WITH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN IMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.

A MAJORITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRICED BY PRICING VENDORS AND ARE

GENERALLY LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS AS THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A QUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THEIR PRICING WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. BROKER PRICING IS USED MAINLY WHEN A QUOTED PRICE

IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE INVESTMENT IS NOT PRICED BY OUR PRICING VENDORS, OR WHEN A BROKER PRICE IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF FAIR VALUES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT TRADES. OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY LABELED AS LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS

BECAUSE THE BROKER PRICES THESE INVESTMENTS BASED ON SIMILAR ASSETS WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION, ALL OF OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS HAVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF TRADING VOLUME TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FAIR VALUES USED ARE

APPROPRIATE FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. OUR FAIR VALUE PROCESSES INCLUDE CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED. THESE CONTROLS INCLUDE MODEL VALIDATION, REVIEW OF KEY MODEL INPUTS, ANALYSIS OF PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD

FLUCTUATIONS, AND INDEPENDENT RECALCULATION OF PRICES WHERE APPROPRIATE.

CASH FLOWS

FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $4.6

BILLION DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TO $31.6 BILLION DUE MAINLY TO INCREASED REVENUE AND CASH COLLECTIONS FROM CUSTOMERS. CASH USED FOR FINANCING INCREASED $1.0 BILLION TO $9.4 BILLION DUE MAINLY TO A $6.0 BILLION NET DECREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM

ISSUANCES OF DEBT AND A $1.2 BILLION INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS PAID, OFFSET IN PART BY A $6.5 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. CASH USED IN INVESTING INCREASED $10.2 BILLION TO $24.8 BILLION DUE MAINLY TO A $10.0 BILLION

INCREASE IN ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND PURCHASES OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND A $1.4 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH FROM SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $1.2 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR NET PURCHASES, MATURITIES, AND SALES OF

INVESTMENTS.

FISCAL YEAR 2011 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2010

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $2.9 BILLION DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TO $27.0 BILLION DUE MAINLY TO INCREASED REVENUE AND CASH COLLECTIONS FROM CUSTOMERS. CASH USED IN FINANCING DECREASED $4.9 BILLION

TO $8.4 BILLION DUE MAINLY TO A $5.8 BILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCE OF DEBT, NET OF REPAYMENTS, OFFSET IN PART BY A $602 MILLION INCREASE IN CASH PAID FOR DIVIDENDS. CASH USED IN INVESTING INCREASED $3.3 BILLION TO $14.6 BILLION DUE TO A

$5.8 BILLION INCREASE IN PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS, OFFSET IN PART BY A $2.5 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH FROM SECURITIES LENDING.

DEBT

WE ISSUED DEBT IN PRIOR PERIODS TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE PRICING AND LIQUIDITY IN THE DEBT MARKETS, REFLECTING OUR CREDIT RATING AND THE LOW

INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. THE PROCEEDS OF THESE ISSUANCES WERE USED TO PARTIALLY FUND DISCRETIONARY BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE TOTAL CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING THE CURRENT PORTION, WERE $11.9 BILLION AND $13.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THIS IS COMPARED WITH A CARRYING

VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $11.9 BILLION AND $12.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF JUNE 30, 2011. THESE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ARE BASED ON LEVEL 2 INPUTS.

NOTES

THE

NOTES ARE SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS AND RANK EQUALLY WITH OUR OTHER UNSECURED AND UNSUBORDINATED DEBT OUTSTANDING.

CONVERTIBLE DEBT

IN JUNE 2010, WE ISSUED $1.25 BILLION OF ZERO COUPON CONVERTIBLE UNSECURED DEBT DUE ON JUNE 15, 2013 IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT

OFFERING. PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING WERE $1.24 BILLION, NET OF FEES AND EXPENSES, WHICH WERE CAPITALIZED. INITIALLY, EACH $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NOTES WAS CONVERTIBLE INTO 29.94 SHARES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE OF $33.40

PER SHARE. THE CONVERSION RATIO IS ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY FOR DIVIDENDS IN EXCESS OF THE INITIAL DIVIDEND THRESHOLD AS DEFINED IN THE DEBT AGREEMENT. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE NET CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBT WAS $1.2 BILLION AND THE

UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNT WAS $19 MILLION.

PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2013, THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE, ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INTO

CASH AND, IF APPLICABLE, CASH, SHARES OF MICROSOFTS COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION THEREOF, AT OUR ELECTION. ON OR AFTER MARCH 15, 2013, THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE AT ANY TIME. UPON CONVERSION, WE WILL PAY CASH UP TO THE AGGREGATE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES AND PAY OR DELIVER CASH, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AT OUR ELECTION.

BECAUSE THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT MAY BE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY SETTLED IN CASH, WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEPARATELY ACCOUNT FOR THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF THE NOTES IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS OUR NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT

BORROWING RATE WHEN INTEREST COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. THE NET PROCEEDS OF $1.24 BILLION WERE ALLOCATED BETWEEN DEBT FOR $1.18 BILLION AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY FOR $58 MILLION WITH THE PORTION IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY

REPRESENTING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTION TO CONVERT THE DEBT.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES, WE ENTERED INTO CAPPED

CALL TRANSACTIONS WITH CERTAIN OPTION COUNTERPARTIES WHO ARE INITIAL PURCHASERS OF THE NOTES OR THEIR AFFILIATES. THE CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO

REDUCE POTENTIAL DILUTION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE UPON CONVERSION OF THE NOTES. UNDER THE CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS, WE PURCHASED FROM THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES CAPPED CALL OPTIONS THAT IN THE

AGGREGATE RELATE TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE NOTES, WITH A STRIKE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CONVERSION PRICE OF THE NOTES AND WITH AN INITIAL CAP PRICE EQUAL TO $37.16, WHICH IS ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY TO MIRROR ANY

ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CONVERSION PRICE. THE PURCHASED CAPPED CALLS WERE VALUED AT $40 MILLION AND RECORDED TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

UNEARNED

REVENUE

UNEARNED REVENUE AT JUNE 30, 2012 COMPRISED MAINLY UNEARNED REVENUE FROM VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS. UNEARNED REVENUE

FROM VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS REPRESENTS CUSTOMER BILLINGS FOR MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS PAID FOR EITHER AT INCEPTION OF THE AGREEMENT OR ANNUALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS WITH

REVENUE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD. UNEARNED REVENUE AT JUNE 30, 2012 ALSO INCLUDED PAYMENTS FOR: POST-DELIVERY SUPPORT AND CONSULTING SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED IN THE FUTURE; XBOX LIVE SUBSCRIPTIONS AND PREPAID POINTS;

THE WINDOWS UPGRADE OFFER; MICROSOFT DYNAMICS BUSINESS SOLUTIONS PRODUCTS; SKYPE PREPAID CREDITS AND SUBSCRIPTIONS; OEM MINIMUM COMMITMENTS; AND OTHER OFFERINGS FOR WHICH WE HAVE BEEN PAID IN ADVANCE AND EARN THE REVENUE WHEN WE PROVIDE THE SERVICE

OF $220 MILLION (RELATED TO THE ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS) FROM THE AMOUNTS PRESENTED, AS THE AMOUNTS THAT WILL BE SETTLED IN CASH ARE NOT KNOWN AND THE TIMING OF ANY PAYMENTS IS UNCERTAIN. WE HAVE ALSO EXCLUDED UNEARNED

REVENUE OF $1.4 BILLION AND NON-CASH ITEMS OF $202 MILLION.

OTHER PLANNED USES OF CAPITAL

ON JULY 18, 2012, WE ACQUIRED YAMMER, INC. (YAMMER), A LEADING PROVIDER OF ENTERPRISE SOCIAL NETWORKS, FOR $1.2 BILLION IN CASH.

YAMMER WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ITS STANDALONE SERVICE AND WILL ADD AN ENTERPRISE SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICE TO MICROSOFTS PORTFOLIO OF COMPLEMENTARY CLOUD-BASED SERVICES.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES, MARKETING, PRODUCT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EXISTING AND ADVANCED AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY. ADDITIONS TO

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WILL CONTINUE, INCLUDING NEW FACILITIES, DATA CENTERS, AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, SUPPORT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. WE HAVE OPERATING LEASES FOR MOST U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES

AND SUPPORT OFFICES AND CERTAIN EQUIPMENT. WE HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT LIQUIDITY OR THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL

RESOURCES.

LIQUIDITY

WE EARN A

SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING INCOME OUTSIDE THE U.S., WHICH IS DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. AS A RESULT, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS,

40

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

THE MAJORITY OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT INTEND NOR FORESEE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THESE FUNDS. WE EXPECT

EXISTING DOMESTIC CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR DOMESTIC OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS REGULAR

QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, DEBT REPAYMENT SCHEDULES, AND MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT EXISTING FOREIGN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR FOREIGN OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE

FUTURE.

SHOULD WE REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THAN IS GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS DOMESTICALLY, FOR EXAMPLE TO FUND SIGNIFICANT

DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, WE COULD ELECT TO REPATRIATE FUTURE EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS OR RAISE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUANCES. THESE ALTERNATIVES COULD RESULT IN

HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, OR DILUTION OF OUR EARNINGS. WE HAVE BORROWED FUNDS DOMESTICALLY AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

RECENTLY

ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

ON JULY 1, 2011, WE ADOPTED GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD

(FASB) ON DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF ROLL-FORWARD ACTIVITIES ON PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCES, AND SETTLEMENTS OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING

SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS). ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ON JANUARY 1, 2012, WE ADOPTED GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FASB ON ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE LIMITS THE HIGHEST-AND-BEST-USE MEASURE TO

NONFINANCIAL ASSETS, PERMITS CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WITH OFFSETTING POSITIONS IN MARKET OR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS TO BE MEASURED AT A NET BASIS, AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE APPLICABILITY OF PREMIUMS AND

DISCOUNTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE GUIDANCE EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES ON LEVEL 3 INPUTS BY REQUIRING QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS, AS WELL AS DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION PROCESSES AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FAIR

VALUE TO CHANGES IN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RECENT

ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE NOT YET ADOPTED

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ENHANCING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE NATURE

OF AN ENTITYS RIGHT TO OFFSET AND RELATED ARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF THE GROSS AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO RIGHTS OF SET-OFF, AMOUNTS OFFSET IN

ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOLLOWED, AND THE RELATED NET EXPOSURE. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.

IN SEPTEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE NEW GUIDANCE

PROVIDES AN ENTITY THE OPTION TO FIRST PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF AN ENTITY DETERMINES THAT THIS IS THE CASE, IT IS

REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE CURRENTLY PRESCRIBED TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THAT REPORTING UNIT (IF ANY). IF AN ENTITY DETERMINES

THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS GREATER THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS NOT REQUIRED. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2012.

IN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE NEW GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE CURRENT OPTION TO REPORT OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND ITS COMPONENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. INSTEAD, AN ENTITY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PRESENT EITHER A CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF NET INCOME AND

41

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. THIS PORTION OF THE GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2012 AND WILL REQUIRE FINANCIAL

STATEMENT PRESENTATION CHANGES ONLY. THE NEW GUIDANCE ALSO REQUIRED ENTITIES TO PRESENT RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME BY COMPONENT IN BOTH THE STATEMENT IN WHICH NET INCOME IS PRESENTED AND THE STATEMENT

IN WHICH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS PRESENTED. HOWEVER, IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE THAT INDEFINITELY DEFERS THE GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE PRESENTATION OF RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF

ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENTS APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR US INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES,

GOODWILL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, CONTINGENCIES, INCOME TAXES, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING WHETHER A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT INCLUDES MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, AND IF SO, WHETHER

VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE) OF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR THOSE ELEMENTS. A PORTION OF REVENUE MAY BE RECORDED AS UNEARNED DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS. CHANGES TO THE ELEMENTS IN A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY

VSOE FOR THOSE ELEMENTS, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF EARNED AND UNEARNED REVENUE. JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER FUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR

UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS.

WINDOWS 7 REVENUE IS SUBJECT TO DEFERRAL AS A RESULT OF THE WINDOWS UPGRADE OFFER,

WHICH STARTED JUNE 2, 2012. THE OFFER PROVIDES SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED RIGHTS TO PURCHASE WINDOWS 8 PRO TO QUALIFYING END USERS THAT PURCHASE WINDOWS 7 PCS DURING THE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD. MICROSOFT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING WINDOWS 8 PRO TO

THE END CUSTOMER. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE RELATED TO THE ALLOCATED DISCOUNT FOR UNDELIVERED WINDOWS 8 IS DEFERRED UNTIL IT IS DELIVERED OR THE REDEMPTION PERIOD EXPIRES.

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES

WE REVIEW INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY QUARTERLY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL

IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN

COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO

SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING

CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IF MARKET, INDUSTRY, AND/OR INVESTEE

CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.

GOODWILL

WE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A

RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR

CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE

INDICATORS, COMPETITION, OR SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT.

42

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

APPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF

REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS, ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, ESTIMATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OVER

WHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.

THE ESTIMATES USED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE

OF A REPORTING UNIT CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON OPERATING RESULTS, MARKET CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH

REPORTING UNIT.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

COSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS

ESTABLISHED, ALL SOFTWARE COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL

FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED AFTER ALL HIGH-RISK DEVELOPMENT ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED THROUGH CODING AND TESTING. GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE COSTS

IS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE PRODUCTS.

LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

THE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY

SUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM IS ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DISCLOSURE OF A CONTINGENCY IS REQUIRED

IF THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS SHOULD BE ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE

ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME TAXES

THE OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND DEFERRED TAX

LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT

THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT

HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ACCOUNTING LITERATURE ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX

RETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND IS RECOGNIZED AS

EXPENSE, NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES, OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS AT THE GRANT DATE REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING ESTIMATING EXPECTED DIVIDENDS. IN ADDITION, JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN

ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE FORFEITED. IF ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED.

STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION THAT ARE PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE AMOUNTS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

THE COMPANY DESIGNS AND MAINTAINS ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE AT REASONABLE COST THAT ASSETS ARE

SAFEGUARDED AGAINST LOSS FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISPOSITION, AND THAT THE FINANCIAL RECORDS ARE RELIABLE FOR PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ASSETS. THESE SYSTEMS ARE AUGMENTED BY WRITTEN POLICIES, AN

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE PROVIDING DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES, CAREFUL SELECTION AND TRAINING OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, AND A PROGRAM OF INTERNAL AUDITS.

THE COMPANY ENGAGED DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, TO AUDIT AND RENDER AN OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS,

THROUGH ITS AUDIT COMMITTEE, CONSISTING SOLELY OF INDEPENDENT DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY, MEETS PERIODICALLY WITH MANAGEMENT, INTERNAL AUDITORS, AND OUR INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM TO ENSURE THAT EACH IS MEETING ITS RESPONSIBILITIES

AND TO DISCUSS MATTERS CONCERNING INTERNAL CONTROLS AND FINANCIAL REPORTING. DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP AND THE INTERNAL AUDITORS EACH HAVE FULL AND FREE ACCESS TO THE AUDIT COMMITTEE.

MARKET RISK

RISKS

WE ARE EXPOSED TO ECONOMIC RISK FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT RISK, EQUITY PRICES, AND COMMODITY PRICES. A PORTION OF THESE RISKS IS HEDGED, BUT THEY MAY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY AND

USE HEDGES WHERE PRACTICABLE TO OFFSET THE RISKS AND MAXIMIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR.

INTEREST RATE

OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO

IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS CREDIT SECTORS AND MATURITIES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF THE FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL AND

DOMESTIC FIXED-INCOME INDICES. IN ADDITION, WE USE TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO AGENCY AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

EQUITY

OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF

GLOBAL, DEVELOPED, AND EMERGING MARKET SECURITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. WE MANAGE THE SECURITIES RELATIVE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC INDICES AND EXPECT THEIR ECONOMIC RISK AND RETURN TO CORRELATE WITH THESE INDICES.

COMMODITY

WE USE BROAD-BASED

COMMODITY EXPOSURES TO ENHANCE PORTFOLIO RETURNS AND FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS EXPOSURE TO A VARIETY OF COMMODITIES, INCLUDING PRECIOUS METALS, ENERGY, AND GRAIN. WE MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO GLOBAL

COMMODITY INDICES AND EXPECT THEIR ECONOMIC RISK AND RETURN TO CORRELATE WITH THESE INDICES.

VALUE-AT-RISK

WE USE A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE AND QUANTIFY OUR MARKET RISKS. VAR IS THE EXPECTED LOSS, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE LEVEL,

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING DETERMINATIONS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S. GAAP), BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF ALL HOLDINGS IS COMPUTED

BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS AMONG FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, AND COMMODITY PRICES, ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE VAR IS CALCULATED AS THE TOTAL LOSS THAT WILL NOT BE EXCEEDED AT THE 97.5 PERCENTILE CONFIDENCE LEVEL OR, ALTERNATIVELY STATED, THE LOSSES

COULD EXCEED THE VAR IN 25 OUT OF 1,000 CASES. SEVERAL RISK FACTORS ARE NOT CAPTURED IN THE MODEL, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, AND LEGAL RISK.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA (U.S. GAAP).

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. EQUITY INVESTMENTS THROUGH WHICH WE EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE OVER BUT DO NOT CONTROL THE INVESTEE AND ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE INVESTEES ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD. INVESTMENTS THROUGH WHICH WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE

INVESTEE AND WHICH DO NOT HAVE READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE COST METHOD.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES,

REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. EXAMPLES OF ESTIMATES INCLUDE: LOSS CONTINGENCIES; PRODUCT WARRANTIES; THE FAIR VALUE OF, AND/OR POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR, OUR REPORTING UNITS; PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES; USEFUL LIVES OF OUR TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS;

ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS; ALLOWANCES FOR PRODUCT RETURNS; AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FORFEITURE RATES. EXAMPLES OF ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE: THE ELEMENTS COMPRISING A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, INCLUDING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN UPGRADES OR

ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW PRODUCTS; WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ACHIEVED FOR OUR PRODUCTS; THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS; AND DETERMINING WHEN

INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ACTUAL RESULTS AND OUTCOMES MAY DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

FOREIGN

CURRENCIES

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT THE EXCHANGE RATE ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE.

REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM THIS PROCESS ARE RECORDED TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI).

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED

WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE FEE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTIBILITY IS PROBABLE. REVENUE GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED NET OF ALLOWANCES FOR RETURNS AND ANY TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND

SUBSEQUENTLY REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.

REVENUE FOR RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCTS, PRODUCTS LICENSED TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT

MANUFACTURERS (OEMS), AND PERPETUAL LICENSES UNDER CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE. REVENUE FOR PRODUCTS UNDER TECHNOLOGY GUARANTEE PROGRAMS, WHICH PROVIDE FREE OR

SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED RIGHTS TO USE UPCOMING NEW VERSIONS OF A SOFTWARE PRODUCT IF AN END USER LICENSES EXISTING VERSIONS OF THE PRODUCT DURING THE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD, IS ALLOCATED BETWEEN EXISTING PRODUCT AND THE NEW PRODUCT, AND REVENUE

ALLOCATED TO THE NEW PRODUCT IS DEFERRED UNTIL THAT VERSION IS DELIVERED. THE REVENUE ALLOCATION IS BASED ON VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE OF THE PRODUCTS.

CERTAIN MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH RIGHTS TO RECEIVE FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS (SOFTWARE

ASSURANCE) AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD. REVENUE FROM CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS THAT ALLOW FOR THE USE OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE

OVER A PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT TAKING POSSESSION OF SOFTWARE ARE ALSO ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS. REVENUE FOR SOFTWARE

51

PART II

ITEM 8

PRODUCTS WHERE CUSTOMERS HAVE THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS AND FOR WHICH VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE DOES NOT EXIST

FOR THE UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE.

REVENUE RELATED TO OUR

XBOX 360 GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLE, KINECT FOR XBOX 360, GAMES PUBLISHED BY US, AND OTHER HARDWARE COMPONENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN OWNERSHIP IS TRANSFERRED TO THE RESELLERS. REVENUE RELATED TO GAMES PUBLISHED BY THIRD PARTIES FOR USE

ON THE XBOX 360 PLATFORM IS RECOGNIZED WHEN GAMES ARE MANUFACTURED BY THE GAME PUBLISHERS.

DISPLAY ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS

ADVERTISEMENTS ARE DISPLAYED. SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE AD APPEARS IN THE SEARCH RESULTS OR WHEN THE ACTION NECESSARY TO EARN THE REVENUE HAS BEEN COMPLETED. CONSULTING SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED,

GENERALLY BASED ON THE NEGOTIATED HOURLY RATE IN THE CONSULTING ARRANGEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED DURING THE PERIOD. CONSULTING REVENUE FOR FIXED-PRICE SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. REVENUE FROM PREPAID

POINTS REDEEMABLE FOR THE PURCHASE OF SOFTWARE OR SERVICES IS RECOGNIZED UPON REDEMPTION OF THE POINTS AND DELIVERY OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES.

COST OF REVENUE

COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES;

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS FOR PRODUCTS SOLD AND PROGRAMS LICENSED; OPERATING COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICE CENTERS AND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS; COSTS INCURRED TO INCLUDE SOFTWARE ON PCS SOLD BY OEMS, TO DRIVE TRAFFIC TO

OUR WEBSITES, AND TO ACQUIRE ONLINE ADVERTISING SPACE (TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS); COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN INTERNET-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING ROYALTIES; WARRANTY COSTS; INVENTORY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS; COSTS

ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELIVERY OF CONSULTING SERVICES; AND THE AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS. CAPITALIZED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PRODUCTS.

PRODUCT WARRANTY

WE PROVIDE FOR THE

ESTIMATED COSTS OF FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FOR HARDWARE WARRANTIES, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED PRODUCT FAILURE RATES, HISTORICAL

AND PROJECTED REPAIR COSTS, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES (IF ANY). THE SPECIFIC HARDWARE WARRANTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS VARY DEPENDING UPON THE PRODUCT SOLD AND THE COUNTRY IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, BUT GENERALLY INCLUDE PARTS AND LABOR

OVER A PERIOD GENERALLY RANGING FROM 90 DAYS TO THREE YEARS. FOR SOFTWARE WARRANTIES, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS TO PROVIDE BUG FIXES, SUCH AS SECURITY PATCHES, OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE. WE REGULARLY REEVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES TO ASSESS

THE ADEQUACY OF THE RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUST THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES

ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING COSTS, LOCALIZATION COSTS INCURRED TO TRANSLATE SOFTWARE FOR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND THE AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED

SOFTWARE CODE AND SERVICES CONTENT. SUCH COSTS RELATED TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ARE INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE UNTIL THE POINT THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS REACHED, WHICH FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, IS GENERALLY SHORTLY BEFORE

THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS REACHED, SUCH COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED TO COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PRODUCTS.

SALES AND MARKETING

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS,

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SALES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL, AND THE COSTS OF ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS, TRADE SHOWS, SEMINARS, AND OTHER PROGRAMS. ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED.

ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.6 BILLION, $1.9 BILLION, AND $1.6 BILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2012, 2011, AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

52

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

WE MEASURE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND RECOGNIZE IT AS EXPENSE, NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES, OVER THE VESTING OR SERVICE PERIOD, AS APPLICABLE, OF THE

STOCK AWARD (GENERALLY FOUR TO FIVE YEARS) USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE PURCHASED BY EMPLOYEES AT THREE-MONTH INTERVALS AT 90% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE STOCK ON THE LAST DAY OF

EACH THREE-MONTH PERIOD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN IS MEASURED AS THE DISCOUNT THE EMPLOYEE IS ENTITLED TO UPON PURCHASE AND IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD OF PURCHASE.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL INCOME TAXES, THE PROVISION FOR U.S. TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES NOT DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY INVESTED, AND INTEREST AND PENALTIES ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. CERTAIN INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE

NOT REPORTED IN TAX RETURNS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE SAME YEAR. THE TAX EFFECT OF SUCH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IS REPORTED AS DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REPORTED NET OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. THE DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT OR LONG-TERM BASED ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE RELATED ASSET OR LIABILITY.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

WE ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE

HIERARCHY BELOW LISTS THREE LEVELS OF FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET. WE CATEGORIZE EACH OF OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS IN ONE OF THESE THREE LEVELS BASED ON THE LOWEST

LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THESE LEVELS ARE.



LEVEL 1

 INPUTS ARE BASED UPON UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS. OUR LEVEL 1 NON-DERIVATIVE

INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE U.S. TREASURIES, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND ACTIVELY TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS. OUR LEVEL 1 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDE THOSE ACTIVELY TRADED ON EXCHANGES.



LEVEL 2

 INPUTS ARE BASED UPON QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN

MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, AND MODEL-BASED VALUATION TECHNIQUES (E.G. THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL) FOR WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. WHERE APPLICABLE, THESE MODELS PROJECT FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNT THE FUTURE AMOUNTS TO A PRESENT VALUE USING MARKET-BASED OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE CURVES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, AND FORWARD AND SPOT

PRICES FOR CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES. OUR LEVEL 2 NON-DERIVATIVE INVESTMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AGENCY SECURITIES, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, AND COMMERCIAL PAPER. OUR LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVE ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CERTAIN OVER-THE-COUNTER OPTION AND SWAP CONTRACTS.



LEVEL 3

 INPUTS ARE GENERALLY UNOBSERVABLE AND TYPICALLY REFLECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN

PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. THE FAIR VALUES ARE THEREFORE DETERMINED USING MODEL-BASED TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING OPTION PRICING MODELS AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS. OUR LEVEL 3 NON-DERIVATIVE ASSETS PRIMARILY COMPRISE INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN

CORPORATE BONDS AND GOODWILL WHEN IT IS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE DUE TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. WE VALUE THE LEVEL 3 CORPORATE BONDS USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED VALUATION MODELS, INPUTS TO WHICH INCLUDE INTEREST RATE CURVES, CREDIT SPREADS, STOCK

PRICES, AND VOLATILITIES. OUR LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PRIMARILY COMPRISE DERIVATIVES FOR FOREIGN EQUITIES. IN CERTAIN CASES, MARKET-BASED OBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AND WE USE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO DEVELOP ASSUMPTIONS TO

DETERMINE FAIR VALUE FOR THESE DERIVATIVES. UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN ALL OF THESE MODELS ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

53

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

WE MEASURE CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE ON A

NONRECURRING BASIS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON VALUATION TECHNIQUES USING THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE, AND MAY INCLUDE QUOTED MARKET PRICES, MARKET

COMPARABLES, AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED WHEN THE COST OF THE INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE AND THIS CONDITION IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

OUR OTHER CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS AND OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL LIABILITIES HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUES.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL

HIGHLY LIQUID INTEREST-EARNING INVESTMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUES. IN GENERAL, INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL

MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES BEYOND ONE YEAR MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM BASED ON THEIR HIGHLY LIQUID NATURE AND

BECAUSE SUCH MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT THE INVESTMENT OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. ALL CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED USING THE

SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE, EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, ARE REFLECTED IN OCI.

EQUITY AND

OTHER INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM INCLUDE BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. DEBT AND PUBLICLY-TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE, EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, ARE REFLECTED IN OCI. COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK AND OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE RESTRICTED FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR OR ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRADED ARE RECORDED AT COST OR USING THE

EQUITY METHOD.

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE

CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH

RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY.

INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE

IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED BASED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MARKET INFORMATION OR OTHER ESTIMATES DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT. WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE

AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION

AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES

IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN THE

FAIR VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON THE INTENDED USE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND THE RESULTING DESIGNATION.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS

DESIGNATED AS FAIR-VALUE HEDGES, THE GAIN (LOSS) IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE OFFSETTING LOSS OR GAIN ON THE HEDGED ITEMS ATTRIBUTED TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS FAIR-VALUE HEDGES,

CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

54

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE

DERIVATIVES GAIN (LOSS) IS INITIALLY REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED EXPOSURE IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE

EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. GAINS (LOSSES) ON DERIVATIVES REPRESENTING EITHER HEDGE COMPONENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS OR HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES, GAINS (LOSSES) FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES ARE PRIMARILY RECOGNIZED IN

OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE). OTHER THAN THOSE DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, SUCH AS COMMODITY CONTRACTS, THE GAINS (LOSSES) ARE GENERALLY ECONOMICALLY OFFSET BY UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) IN THE UNDERLYING AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE

SECURITIES, WHICH ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI UNTIL THE SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, AT WHICH TIME THE AMOUNTS ARE MOVED FROM OCI INTO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS REFLECTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE. WE DETERMINE THE ALLOWANCE BASED ON KNOWN TROUBLED ACCOUNTS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND OTHER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE.

ACTIVITY IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WAS AS FOLLOWS.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET, USING THE AVERAGE COST METHOD. COST INCLUDES MATERIALS, LABOR, AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD

RELATED TO THE PURCHASE AND PRODUCTION OF INVENTORIES. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVENTORY QUANTITIES ON HAND, FUTURE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, AND THE ESTIMATED UTILITY OF OUR INVENTORY. IF OUR REVIEW INDICATES A REDUCTION IN UTILITY BELOW

CARRYING VALUE, WE REDUCE OUR INVENTORY TO A NEW COST BASIS THROUGH A CHARGE TO COST OF REVENUE.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IS STATED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE SHORTER OF THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET

OR THE LEASE TERM. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF OUR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE GENERALLY AS FOLLOWS: COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR ACQUIRED FOR INTERNAL USE, THREE YEARS; COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, TWO TO THREE YEARS; BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS, FIVE TO

15 YEARS; LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, TWO TO 10 YEARS; AND FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT, ONE TO FIVE YEARS. LAND IS NOT DEPRECIATED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1

FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ALL OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION AND ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR ESTIMATED PERIOD OF BENEFIT, RANGING FROM ONE TO 15 YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF

INTANGIBLE ASSETS PERIODICALLY BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY WARRANT REVISED ESTIMATES OF USEFUL LIVES OR THAT INDICATE THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

ON JULY 1, 2011, WE ADOPTED GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ON DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED

TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF ROLL-FORWARD ACTIVITIES ON PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCES, AND SETTLEMENTS OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS). ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ON JANUARY 1, 2012,

WE ADOPTED GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FASB ON ACCOUNTING AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE LIMITS THE HIGHEST-AND-BEST-USE MEASURE TO NONFINANCIAL ASSETS, PERMITS CERTAIN FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES

WITH OFFSETTING POSITIONS IN MARKET OR COUNTERPARTY CREDIT RISKS TO BE MEASURED AT A NET BASIS, AND PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON THE APPLICABILITY OF PREMIUMS AND DISCOUNTS. ADDITIONALLY, THE GUIDANCE EXPANDS THE DISCLOSURES ON LEVEL 3 INPUTS BY

REQUIRING QUANTITATIVE DISCLOSURE OF THE UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS AND ASSUMPTIONS, AS WELL AS DESCRIPTION OF THE VALUATION PROCESSES AND THE SENSITIVITY OF THE FAIR VALUE TO CHANGES IN UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE

A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE NOT YET ADOPTED

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ENHANCING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE NATURE OF AN ENTITYS RIGHT TO OFFSET AND RELATED

ARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF THE GROSS AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO RIGHTS OF SET-OFF, AMOUNTS OFFSET IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOLLOWED, AND

THE RELATED NET EXPOSURE. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.

IN SEPTEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE NEW GUIDANCE PROVIDES AN ENTITY THE OPTION TO FIRST PERFORM A

QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF AN ENTITY DETERMINES THAT THIS IS THE CASE, IT IS REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE CURRENTLY PRESCRIBED

TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THAT REPORTING UNIT (IF ANY). IF AN ENTITY DETERMINES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS

GREATER THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS NOT REQUIRED. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2012.

IN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE NEW GUIDANCE ELIMINATES THE CURRENT OPTION TO REPORT OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME AND ITS COMPONENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF

CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. INSTEAD, AN ENTITY WILL BE REQUIRED TO PRESENT EITHER A CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF NET INCOME AND OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. THIS PORTION OF THE GUIDANCE

WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2012 AND WILL REQUIRE FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION CHANGES ONLY. THE NEW GUIDANCE ALSO REQUIRED ENTITIES TO PRESENT RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME BY

COMPONENT IN BOTH THE STATEMENT IN WHICH NET INCOME IS PRESENTED AND THE STATEMENT IN WHICH OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME IS PRESENTED. HOWEVER, IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE WHICH INDEFINITELY DEFERS THE GUIDANCE RELATED TO THE

PRESENTATION OF RECLASSIFICATION ADJUSTMENTS.

NOTE 2  EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EPS IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PLUS THE EFFECT OF DILUTIVE POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. DILUTIVE

POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES INCLUDE OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK AWARDS, AND SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS. THE COMPONENTS OF BASIC AND DILUTED EPS ARE AS FOLLOWS.

UNREALIZED LOSSES FROM FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST RATES. UNREALIZED

LOSSES FROM DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES ARE DUE TO MARKET PRICE MOVEMENTS. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE ANY REMAINING UNREALIZED LOSSES REPRESENT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE AS OF

JUNE 30, 2012.

AT JUNE 30, 2012 AND 2011, THE RECORDED BASES OF COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK AND OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE

RESTRICTED FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR OR ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRADED WERE $313 MILLION AND $334 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE CARRIED AT COST AND ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. IT IS NOT POSSIBLE FOR

US TO RELIABLY ESTIMATE THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS.

NOTE 5  DERIVATIVES

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND CREDIT; TO

ENHANCE INVESTMENT RETURNS; AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. OUR OBJECTIVES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVES INCLUDE REDUCING, ELIMINATING, AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THESE EXPOSURES AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. OUR DERIVATIVE

PROGRAMS INCLUDE STRATEGIES THAT BOTH QUALIFY AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. ALL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS PRESENTED BELOW ARE MEASURED IN U.S. CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE POSITIONS. OPTION AND FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INTERNATIONAL REVENUE FOR

UP TO THREE YEARS IN THE FUTURE AND ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012 AND JUNE 30, 2011, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS SOLD WERE $6.7 BILLION AND $10.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS RELATED TO

CERTAIN NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES ARE HEDGED USING FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012 AND JUNE 30, 2011, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS SOLD WERE $1.3 BILLION AND $572 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CERTAIN OPTIONS AND FORWARDS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO USED TO MANAGE THE VARIABILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, CASH, AND INTERCOMPANY POSITIONS, AND TO MANAGE OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE

FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $3.6 BILLION AND $7.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $4.3 BILLION AND $7.1 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

EQUITY

SECURITIES HELD IN OUR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. MARKET PRICE RISK IS MANAGED RELATIVE TO

BROAD-BASED GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC EQUITY INDICES USING CERTAIN CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED INVESTMENTS, OPTIONS, FUTURES, AND SWAP CONTRACTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, TO HEDGE OUR PRICE RISK, WE MAY USE AND DESIGNATE EQUITY

DERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING PUTS, CALLS, SWAPS, AND FORWARDS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED EQUITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.4 BILLION AND $982 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED EQUITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.1 BILLION AND $860 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

INTEREST RATE

SECURITIES HELD IN OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTEREST

RATE RISKS BASED ON THEIR MATURITIES. WE MANAGE THE AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN BROAD-BASED FIXED-INCOME INDICES USING EXCHANGE-TRADED OPTION AND FUTURES CONTRACTS AND

OVER-THE-COUNTER SWAP AND OPTION CONTRACTS, NONE OF WHICH ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF FIXED-INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $3.2 BILLION AND $1.9 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF FIXED-INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $2.3 BILLION AND $697 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION, WE USE TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. THESE MEET THE DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENT IN CASES WHERE PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE ASSETS IS NOT TAKEN AT THE EARLIEST AVAILABLE DELIVERY DATE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012 AND 2011, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL DERIVATIVE AMOUNT OF MORTGAGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED WERE $1.1 BILLION AND $868

MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 8

CREDIT

OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. WE USE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO MANAGE CREDIT EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO

BROAD-BASED INDICES AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. WE USE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS AS THEY ARE A LOW COST METHOD OF MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISKS OR GROUPS OF CREDIT RISKS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS OF CREDIT CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $318 MILLION AND $456 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $532 MILLION AND $281 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

COMMODITY

WE USE BROAD-BASED

COMMODITY EXPOSURES TO ENHANCE PORTFOLIO RETURNS AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. WE USE SWAP, FUTURES, AND OPTION CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO GENERATE AND MANAGE EXPOSURES TO BROAD-BASED COMMODITY INDICES. WE

USE DERIVATIVES ON COMMODITIES AS THEY CAN BE LOW-COST ALTERNATIVES TO THE PURCHASE AND STORAGE OF A VARIETY OF COMMODITIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRECIOUS METALS, ENERGY, AND GRAIN. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF

COMMODITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.5 BILLION AND $445 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF COMMODITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.9 BILLION AND $502 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

CERTAIN OF OUR COUNTERPARTY AGREEMENTS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM UNSECURED

DEBT TO MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING AND REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM LIQUIDITY OF $1.0 BILLION. TO THE EXTENT WE FAIL TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL, SIMILAR TO THE STANDARD CONVENTION RELATED

TO OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, OUR LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT RATING WAS AAA, AND CASH INVESTMENTS WERE IN EXCESS OF $1.0 BILLION. AS A RESULT, NO COLLATERAL WAS REQUIRED TO BE POSTED.

SKYPE

ON

OCTOBER 13, 2011, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF SKYPE GLOBAL S.Á R.L. (SKYPE), A LEADING GLOBAL PROVIDER OF SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND RELATED INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS BASED IN LUXEMBOURG, FOR

$8.6 BILLION, PRIMARILY IN CASH. THE MAJOR CLASSES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO WHICH WE ALLOCATED THE PURCHASE PRICE WERE GOODWILL OF $7.1 BILLION, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $1.6 BILLION, AND UNEARNED REVENUE OF $222 MILLION. THE GOODWILL

RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR EXPECTATION OF EXTENDING SKYPES BRAND AND THE REACH OF ITS NETWORKED PLATFORM, WHILE ENHANCING MICROSOFTS EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF REAL-TIME COMMUNICATIONS

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE ASSIGNED THE GOODWILL TO THE FOLLOWING SEGMENTS: $4.2 BILLION TO ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION, $2.8 BILLION TO MICROSOFT BUSINESS DIVISION, AND $54 MILLION TO ONLINE SERVICES DIVISION. SKYPE WAS CONSOLIDATED INTO OUR

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS STARTING OCTOBER 13, 2011, THE ACQUISITION DATE.

THE MEASUREMENT PERIODS FOR PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS END AS SOON AS INFORMATION ON THE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES

BECOMES AVAILABLE, BUT DO NOT EXCEED 12 MONTHS. ADJUSTMENTS IN PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS MAY REQUIRE A RECASTING OF THE AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO GOODWILL RETROACTIVE TO THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE ACQUISITIONS OCCURRED.

ANY CHANGE IN THE GOODWILL AMOUNTS RESULTING FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS ARE PRESENTED AS OTHER IN THE ABOVE TABLE. ALSO

INCLUDED WITHIN OTHER ARE BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS AND TRANSFERS BETWEEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS DUE TO REORGANIZATIONS, AS APPLICABLE. FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012, A $6.2 BILLION GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS INCLUDED IN OTHER, AS DISCUSSED

FURTHER BELOW. THIS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ALSO REPRESENTS OUR ACCUMULATED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AS OF JUNE 30, 2012.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

WE TESTED GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AS OF MAY 1, 2012 AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY WITH A

PEER-BASED, RISK-ADJUSTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. WE BELIEVE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW APPROACH IS THE MOST RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE FAIR VALUES OF THE BUSINESSES.

UPON COMPLETION OF THE ANNUAL TEST, OSD GOODWILL WAS DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED. THE IMPAIRMENT WAS THE RESULT OF THE OSD UNIT EXPERIENCING SLOWER

THAN PROJECTED GROWTH IN SEARCH QUERIES AND SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE PER QUERY, SLOWER GROWTH IN DISPLAY REVENUE, AND CHANGES IN THE TIMING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CERTAIN INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO DRIVE SEARCH AND DISPLAY REVENUE GROWTH IN THE

FUTURE. ALTHOUGH REVENUES INCREASED COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, THE INDUSTRY IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND CERTAIN OPERATIONAL CHALLENGES HAVE AFFECTED OUR EXPECTATIONS SUCH THAT FUTURE GROWTH AND PROFITABILITY ARE LOWER THAN PREVIOUS ESTIMATES. IN

ADDITION, IN THE CURRENT YEAR, WE ADDED A BUSINESS-SPECIFIC RISK FACTOR TO THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL USED TO CALCULATE THE DISCOUNTED CASH FLOWS OF OSD IN ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE BUSINESS. THIS BUSINESS-SPECIFIC RISK FACTOR

REFLECTS THE INCREASED UNCERTAINTY IN FORECASTING THE FUTURE PERFORMANCE OF OSD.

67

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

BECAUSE OUR ANNUAL TEST INDICATED THAT OSDS CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDED ITS ESTIMATED FAIR

VALUE, A SECOND PHASE OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST (STEP 2) WAS PERFORMED SPECIFIC TO OSD. UNDER STEP 2, THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL OSD ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE ESTIMATED, INCLUDING TANGIBLE ASSETS, EXISTING TECHNOLOGY, TRADE NAMES, AND

PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS FOR THE PURPOSE OF DERIVING AN ESTIMATE OF THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL. THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WAS THEN COMPARED TO THE RECORDED GOODWILL TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. ASSUMPTIONS USED IN

MEASURING THE VALUE OF THESE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDED THE DISCOUNT RATES, ROYALTY RATES, AND OBSOLESCENCE RATES USED IN VALUING THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND PRICING OF COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS IN THE MARKET IN VALUING THE TANGIBLE ASSETS.

NO OTHER INSTANCES OF IMPAIRMENT WERE IDENTIFIED IN OUR MAY 1, 2012 TEST.

CONVERTIBLE DEBT

IN JUNE 2010, WE ISSUED $1.25 BILLION OF ZERO COUPON CONVERTIBLE UNSECURED DEBT DUE ON JUNE 15, 2013 IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERING. PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING WERE $1.24 BILLION, NET OF FEES AND EXPENSES,

WHICH WERE CAPITALIZED. INITIALLY, EACH $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NOTES WAS CONVERTIBLE INTO 29.94 SHARES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE OF $33.40 PER SHARE. THE CONVERSION RATIO IS ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY FOR DIVIDENDS IN EXCESS OF

THE INITIAL DIVIDEND THRESHOLD AS DEFINED IN THE DEBT AGREEMENT. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE NET CARRYING AMOUNT OF OUR CONVERTIBLE DEBT WAS $1.2 BILLION AND THE UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNT WAS $19 MILLION.

PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2013, THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE, ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INTO CASH AND, IF APPLICABLE, CASH, SHARES OF

MICROSOFTS COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION THEREOF, AT OUR ELECTION. ON OR AFTER MARCH 15, 2013, THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE AT ANY TIME. UPON CONVERSION, WE WILL PAY CASH UP TO THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES AND PAY OR

DELIVER CASH, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, OR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AT OUR ELECTION.

BECAUSE THE

CONVERTIBLE DEBT MAY BE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY SETTLED IN CASH, WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEPARATELY ACCOUNT FOR THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF THE NOTES IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS OUR NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT BORROWING RATE WHEN INTEREST COSTS ARE

RECOGNIZED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. THE NET PROCEEDS OF $1.24 BILLION WERE ALLOCATED BETWEEN DEBT FOR $1.18 BILLION AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY FOR $58 MILLION WITH THE PORTION IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY REPRESENTING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTION

TO CONVERT THE DEBT.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES, WE ENTERED INTO CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS WITH CERTAIN OPTION

COUNTERPARTIES WHO ARE INITIAL PURCHASERS OF THE NOTES OR THEIR AFFILIATES. THE CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE POTENTIAL DILUTION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE UPON CONVERSION OF THE NOTES. UNDER THE CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS, WE PURCHASED

FROM THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES CAPPED CALL OPTIONS THAT IN THE AGGREGATE RELATE TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE NOTES, WITH A STRIKE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CONVERSION PRICE OF THE NOTES AND WITH AN INITIAL CAP PRICE

EQUAL TO $37.16, WHICH IS ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY TO MIRROR ANY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CONVERSION PRICE. THE PURCHASED CAPPED CALLS WERE VALUED AT $40 MILLION AND RECORDED TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

CARRYFORWARD GENERATED PRIMARILY IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES AND ACQUIRED PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR ACQUISITION OF SKYPE THAT MAY NOT BE REALIZED.

DEFERRED INCOME TAX BALANCES REFLECT THE EFFECTS OF TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE CARRYING AMOUNTS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AND THEIR TAX

BASES AND ARE STATED AT ENACTED TAX RATES EXPECTED TO BE IN EFFECT WHEN THE TAXES ARE ACTUALLY PAID OR RECOVERED.

AS OF JUNE 30,

2012, WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED DEFERRED U.S. INCOME TAXES OR FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES ON TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES OF APPROXIMATELY $60.8 BILLION RESULTING FROM EARNINGS FOR CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES WHICH ARE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S.

THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES WAS APPROXIMATELY $19.4 BILLION AT JUNE 30, 2012.

INCOME TAXES PAID WERE $3.5 BILLION, $5.3 BILLION, AND $4.1 BILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2012, 2011, AND 2010, RESPECTIVELY.

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS

AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, WE HAD $7.2 BILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX

BENEFITS OF WHICH $6.2 BILLION, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2011, WE HAD $6.9 BILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF WHICH $5.9 BILLION, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD HAVE AFFECTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE.

INTEREST ON UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WAS $154 MILLION, $38 MILLION, AND $193 MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2012, 2011, AND 2010,

RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, 2011, AND 2010, WE HAD ACCRUED INTEREST RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS OF $939 MILLION, $785 MILLION, AND $747 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, NET OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX BENEFITS.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REACHED A SETTLEMENT OF A PORTION OF AN I.R.S. AUDIT OF TAX YEARS

2004 TO 2006, WHICH REDUCED OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE BY $461 MILLION. WHILE WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S. AUDIT, WE REMAIN UNDER AUDIT FOR THESE YEARS. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE I.R.S. WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS REPORT AND REOPENED THE AUDIT

PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING, WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE BELIEVE OUR ALLOWANCES FOR TAX

CONTINGENCIES ARE APPROPRIATE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, AS WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE REMAINING OPEN ISSUES WILL BE

RESOLVED WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2011.

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR TAX YEARS 1996 TO 2011, SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES. THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE AUDITS ARE NOT

EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOTE 14  UNEARNED REVENUE

YAHOO! COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT

ON

DECEMBER 4, 2009, WE ENTERED INTO A 10-YEAR AGREEMENT WITH YAHOO! INC. (YAHOO!) WHEREBY MICROSOFT WILL PROVIDE THE EXCLUSIVE ALGORITHMIC AND PAID SEARCH PLATFORM FOR YAHOO! WEBSITES. MICROSOFT PROVIDED YAHOO! WITH REVENUE PER SEARCH

GUARANTEES FOR A PERIOD OF 18 MONTHS AFTER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE MICROSOFT SEARCH ADS PLATFORM IN EACH COUNTRY, EXTENDED BY AN ADDITIONAL 12 MONTHS FOR THE U.S. AND CANADA. THESE GUARANTEES ARE CALCULATED, PAID, AND ADJUSTED PERIODICALLY AND ARE

RATE GUARANTEES, NOT GUARANTEES OF SEARCH VOLUME. WE ESTIMATE THE REMAINING COST OF THE REVENUE PER SEARCH GUARANTEES DURING THE GUARANTEE PERIOD COULD RANGE UP TO $120 MILLION.

NOTE 17  CONTINGENCIES

ANTITRUST, UNFAIR COMPETITION, AND OVERCHARGE CLASS ACTIONS

A LARGE NUMBER OF ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST US IN VARIOUS STATE, FEDERAL, AND CANADIAN COURTS ON BEHALF OF VARIOUS CLASSES OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT PURCHASERS OF OUR PC

OPERATING SYSTEM AND CERTAIN OTHER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS BETWEEN 1999 AND 2005. WE OBTAINED DISMISSALS OR REACHED SETTLEMENTS OF ALL CLAIMS MADE IN THE UNITED STATES.

ALL SETTLEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE RECEIVED FINAL COURT APPROVAL. UNDER THE SETTLEMENTS, GENERALLY CLASS MEMBERS CAN OBTAIN VOUCHERS THAT ENTITLE THEM TO BE REIMBURSED FOR PURCHASES OF A WIDE VARIETY OF

PLATFORM-NEUTRAL COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. THE TOTAL VALUE OF VOUCHERS THAT WE MAY ISSUE VARIES BY STATE. WE WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN SCHOOLS A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE VOUCHERS THAT ARE NOT ISSUED OR CLAIMED (ONE-HALF TO TWO-THIRDS DEPENDING

ON THE STATE). THE TOTAL VALUE OF VOUCHERS WE ULTIMATELY ISSUE WILL DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBERS WHO MAKE CLAIMS AND ARE ISSUED VOUCHERS. THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF VOUCHERS TO BE ISSUED IS APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION. THE ACTUAL COSTS OF THESE

SETTLEMENTS WILL BE LESS THAN THAT MAXIMUM AMOUNT, DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBERS AND SCHOOLS THAT ARE ISSUED AND REDEEM VOUCHERS. WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL COST TO RESOLVE ALL OF THE STATE OVERCHARGE CLASS ACTION CASES WILL RANGE BETWEEN $1.9

BILLION AND $2.0 BILLION. AT JUNE 30, 2012, WE HAVE RECORDED A LIABILITY RELATED TO THESE CLAIMS OF APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION, WHICH REFLECTS OUR ESTIMATED EXPOSURE OF $1.9 BILLION LESS PAYMENTS MADE TO DATE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION

MOSTLY FOR VOUCHERS, LEGAL FEES, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

THE THREE CASES PENDING IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, ONTARIO, AND QUEBEC, CANADA HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED. IN

MARCH 2010, THE COURT IN THE BRITISH COLUMBIA CASE CERTIFIED IT AS A CLASS ACTION. IN APRIL 2011, THE BRITISH COLUMBIA COURT OF APPEAL REVERSED THE CLASS CERTIFICATION RULING AND DISMISSED THE CASE, HOLDING THAT INDIRECT PURCHASERS DO NOT HAVE

A CLAIM. THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE APPEALED TO THE CANADIAN SUPREME COURT, WHICH WILL BE HEARD IN THE FALL OF 2012. THE OTHER TWO ACTIONS HAVE BEEN STAYED.

OTHER ANTITRUST LITIGATION AND CLAIMS

IN

NOVEMBER 2004, NOVELL, INC. (NOVELL) FILED A COMPLAINT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH (LATER TRANSFERRED TO FEDERAL COURT IN MARYLAND), ASSERTING ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLAIMS AGAINST US RELATED TO

NOVELLS OWNERSHIP OF WORDPERFECT AND OTHER PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN JUNE 1994 AND MARCH 1996. IN JUNE 2005, THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED OUR MOTION TO DISMISS FOUR OF SIX CLAIMS OF THE COMPLAINT. IN MARCH 2010, THE

TRIAL COURT GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MICROSOFT AS TO ALL REMAINING CLAIMS. THE COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THAT RULING AS TO ONE CLAIM. TRIAL OF THAT CLAIM TOOK PLACE FROM OCTOBER TO DECEMBER 2011 AND RESULTED IN A MISTRIAL BECAUSE THE

JURY WAS UNABLE TO REACH A VERDICT. IN JULY 2012, THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED MICROSOFTS MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW. NOVELL MAY APPEAL THIS DECISION.

GOVERNMENT COMPETITION LAW MATTERS

IN DECEMBER 2009, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ADOPTED A

DECISION THAT RENDERED LEGALLY BINDING COMMITMENTS OFFERED BY MICROSOFT TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSIONS CONCERNS ABOUT THE INCLUSION OF WEB BROWSING SOFTWARE IN WINDOWS. AMONG OTHER THINGS, MICROSOFT COMMITTED TO DISPLAY A BROWSER CHOICE

SCREEN ON WINDOWS-BASED PCS IN EUROPE WHERE INTERNET EXPLORER IS SET AS THE DEFAULT BROWSER. DUE TO A TECHNICAL ERROR, WE FAILED TO DELIVER THE REQUISITE SOFTWARE TO ENABLE THAT DISPLAY TO PCS THAT CAME PREINSTALLED WITH A VERSION OF WINDOWS 7

CALLED WINDOWS 7 SERVICE PACK 1. WE DID DELIVER THE REQUISITE SOFTWARE TO PCS RUNNING THE ORIGINAL VERSION OF WINDOWS 7 AND EARLIER EDITIONS OF WINDOWS. FOLLOWING NOTIFICATION BY THE COMMISSION OF REPORTS THAT SOME PCS WERE NOT RECEIVING THE UPDATE,

WE PROMPTLY FIXED THE ERROR AND ADVISED THE COMMISSION OF WHAT WE HAD DISCOVERED. PCS THAT COME PREINSTALLED WITH WINDOWS 7 SERVICE PACK ARE NOW RECEIVING THE BROWSER CHOICE SCREEN SOFTWARE, AS INTENDED. ON JULY 17, 2012, THE COMMISSION

ANNOUNCED THAT IT HAD OPENED PROCEEDINGS TO INVESTIGATE WHETHER MICROSOFT HAD FAILED TO COMPLY WITH THIS COMMITMENT. THE COMMISSION STATED THAT IF A COMPANY IS FOUND TO HAVE BREACHED A LEGALLY BINDING COMMITMENT, THE COMPANY MAY BE FINED UP TO 10%

OF ITS WORLDWIDE ANNUAL REVENUE.

PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS

MOTOROLA LITIGATION

IN OCTOBER 2010, MICROSOFT FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT COMPLAINTS AGAINST

MOTOROLA MOBILITY (MOTOROLA) WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION (ITC) AND IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE FOR INFRINGEMENT OF NINE MICROSOFT PATENTS BY MOTOROLAS ANDROID DEVICES. SINCE THEN, MICROSOFT AND

MOTOROLA HAVE FILED ADDITIONAL CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER IN THE ITC, IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURTS IN SEATTLE, WISCONSIN, FLORIDA, AND CALIFORNIA, AND IN COURTS IN GERMANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. IN APRIL 2012, FOLLOWING COMPLAINTS BY MICROSOFT AND

APPLE, THE EUROPEAN UNIONS COMPETITION OFFICE OPENED TWO ANTITRUST INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST MOTOROLA TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT HAS ABUSED CERTAIN OF ITS STANDARD ESSENTIAL PATENTS TO DISTORT COMPETITION IN BREACH OF EUROPEAN UNION ANTITRUST RULES.

IN JUNE 2012, WE RECEIVED A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) APPARENTLY RELATED TO AN FTC INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER MOTOROLAS CONDUCT VIOLATES U.S. LAW. THE NATURE OF THE CLAIMS ASSERTED AND

STATUS OF INDIVIDUAL MATTERS ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION

THE HEARING IN MICROSOFTS ITC CASE AGAINST MOTOROLA TOOK PLACE IN AUGUST 2011 ON SEVEN OF THE NINE PATENTS ORIGINALLY ASSERTED IN THE

COMPLAINT. IN DECEMBER 2011, THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE (ALJ) ISSUED AN INITIAL DETERMINATION THAT MOTOROLA INFRINGED ONE MICROSOFT PATENT, AND RECOMMENDED THAT THE ITC ISSUE A LIMITED EXCLUSION

76

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

ORDER AGAINST MOTOROLA PROHIBITING IMPORTATION OF INFRINGING MOTOROLA ANDROID DEVICES. IN MAY 2012, THE ITC ISSUED THE LIMITED EXCLUSION ORDER RECOMMENDED BY THE ALJ, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON

JULY 18, 2012. MICROSOFT HAS APPEALED CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE ITC RULING ADVERSE TO MICROSOFT; MOTOROLA IS EXPECTED TO APPEAL THE ITC EXCLUSION ORDER.

IN NOVEMBER 2010, MOTOROLA FILED AN ACTION AGAINST MICROSOFT IN THE ITC ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF FIVE MOTOROLA PATENTS BY XBOX CONSOLES AND ACCESSORIES AND SEEKING AN EXCLUSION ORDER TO PROHIBIT IMPORTATION OF THE

ALLEGEDLY INFRINGING XBOX PRODUCTS INTO THE U.S. IN APRIL 2012, THE ALJ FOUND THAT XBOX PRODUCTS INFRINGE FOUR OF THE FIVE PATENTS ASSERTED BY MOTOROLA. THE ALJ SUBSEQUENTLY RECOMMENDED THAT THE ITC ISSUE A LIMITED EXCLUSION ORDER AND A CEASE AND

DESIST ORDER. BOTH MICROSOFT AND MOTOROLA SOUGHT ITC REVIEW OF THE ALJS FINDINGS. IN JUNE 2012, MICROSOFT FILED A MOTION TO TERMINATE THE INVESTIGATION AS TO CERTAIN PATENTS BASED ON FACTS ARISING AS THE RESULT OF GOOGLES ACQUISITION OF

MOTOROLA. THE ITC DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD REVIEW THE ALJS INITIAL DETERMINATION IN ITS ENTIRETY AND REMANDED THE MATTER TO THE ALJ (1) TO APPLY CERTAIN ITC CASE PRECEDENT, (2) TO RULE ON MICROSOFTS JUNE 2012 MOTION TO

TERMINATE, AND (3) SET A NEW TARGET DATE FOR COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION. IF THE ITC ISSUES AN EXCLUSION ORDER OR CEASE AND DESIST ORDER, IT WILL BE SUBJECT TO PRESIDENTIAL REVIEW FOR UP TO 60 DAYS, DURING WHICH IT IS EXPECTED THAT

MICROSOFT COULD IMPORT XBOX PRODUCTS SUBJECT TO POSTING A BOND. SHOULD ANY ORDER ISSUE AND SURVIVE PRESIDENTIAL REVIEW, MICROSOFT MAY BE ABLE TO MITIGATE ITS IMPACT BY ALTERING XBOX PRODUCTS SO THEY DO NOT INFRINGE THE MOTOROLA PATENTS.

U.S. DISTRICT COURT

THE SEATTLE DISTRICT

COURT CASE FILED IN OCTOBER 2010 BY MICROSOFT AS A COMPANION TO MICROSOFTS ITC CASE AGAINST MOTOROLA HAS BEEN STAYED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF MICROSOFTS ITC CASE.

IN NOVEMBER 2010, MICROSOFT SUED MOTOROLA FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE, ALLEGING THAT MOTOROLA BREACHED ITS COMMITMENTS TO STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS TO LICENSE TO MICROSOFT CERTAIN

PATENTS ON REASONABLE AND NON-DISCRIMINATORY (RAND) TERMS AND CONDITIONS. MOTOROLA HAS DECLARED THESE PATENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE H.264 VIDEO STANDARD AND THE 802.11 WI-FI STANDARD. IN SUITS DESCRIBED BELOW, MOTOROLA

OR A MOTOROLA AFFILIATE SUBSEQUENTLY SUED MICROSOFT ON THOSE PATENTS IN U.S. DISTRICT COURTS, IN THE ITC, AND IN GERMANY. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE SEATTLE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED A PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MICROSOFT RULING THAT

(1) MOTOROLA ENTERED INTO BINDING CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS WITH STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS COMMITTING TO LICENSE ITS DECLARED-ESSENTIAL PATENTS ON RAND TERMS AND CONDITIONS; AND (2) MICROSOFT IS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF THOSE COMMITMENTS.

SUBSEQUENTLY, THE COURT REJECTED MOTOROLAS ARGUMENT THAT MICROSOFT HAD REPUDIATED ITS RIGHT TO A RAND LICENSE, AND RULED A TRIAL IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER MOTOROLA IS IN BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATION TO ENTER INTO A PATENT LICENSE WITH

MICROSOFT AND, IF SO, THE AMOUNT OF THE RAND ROYALTY. IN APRIL 2012, THE COURT ISSUED A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING ORDER PREVENTING MOTOROLA FROM TAKING STEPS TO ENFORCE AN INJUNCTION IN GERMANY RELATING TO THE H.264 VIDEO PATENTS. IN MAY 2012, THE COURT

CONVERTED THAT ORDER INTO A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION. MOTOROLA HAS APPEALED THE COURTS INJUNCTION ORDERS TO THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT. THE SEATTLE COURT HAS SET A TRIAL TO DETERMINE THE RAND ROYALTY TO BEGIN IN

NOVEMBER 2012.

CASES FILED BY MOTOROLA IN WISCONSIN, CALIFORNIA, AND FLORIDA, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE CURRENTLY STAYED CASE IN

WISCONSIN (A COMPANION CASE TO MOTOROLAS ITC ACTION), HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED AT MICROSOFTS REQUEST TO THE U.S DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE. MOTOROLA AND MICROSOFT BOTH SEEK DAMAGES AS WELL AS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. NO TRIAL DATES HAVE BEEN SET

IN ANY OF THE TRANSFERRED CASES, AND THE PARTIES HAVE AGREED TO A STAY OF THESE CASES.



IN THE TRANSFERRED CASES, MOTOROLA ASSERTS 15 PATENTS ARE INFRINGED BY MANY MICROSOFT PRODUCTS INCLUDING WINDOWS MOBILE 6.5 AND WINDOWS PHONE 7, WINDOWS

MARKETPLACE, SILVERLIGHT, WINDOWS VISTA AND 7, EXCHANGE SERVER 2003 AND LATER, EXCHANGE ACTIVESYNC, WINDOWS LIVE MESSENGER, LYNC SERVER 2010, OUTLOOK 2010, OFFICE 365, SQL SERVER, INTERNET EXPLORER 9, XBOX, AND KINECT.



IN THE MOTOROLA ACTION ORIGINALLY FILED IN CALIFORNIA, MOTOROLA ASSERTS THAT MICROSOFT VIOLATED ANTITRUST LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH MICROSOFTS ASSERTION

OF PATENTS AGAINST MOTOROLA THAT MICROSOFT HAS AGREED TO LICENSE TO CERTAIN QUALIFYING ENTITIES ON RAND TERMS AND CONDITIONS.



IN COUNTERCLAIMS IN THE PATENT ACTIONS BROUGHT BY MOTOROLA, MICROSOFT ASSERTS 14 PATENTS ARE INFRINGED BY MOTOROLA ANDROID DEVICES AND CERTAIN MOTOROLA

DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDERS.

GERMANY

IN JULY 2011, MOTOROLA FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT ACTIONS IN GERMANY AGAINST MICROSOFT AND SEVERAL MICROSOFT SUBSIDIARIES.



TWO OF THE PATENTS ARE ASSERTED BY MOTOROLA TO BE ESSENTIAL TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE H.264 VIDEO STANDARD, AND MOTOROLA ALLEGES THAT H.264 CAPABLE PRODUCTS

INCLUDING XBOX 360, WINDOWS 7, MEDIA PLAYER, AND INTERNET EXPLORER INFRINGE THOSE PATENTS. MOTOROLA SEEKS DAMAGES AND AN INJUNCTION. IN MAY 2012, THE COURT ISSUED AN INJUNCTION RELATING TO ALL H.264 CAPABLE MICROSOFT PRODUCTS IN GERMANY. HOWEVER,

DUE TO ORDERS IN THE SEPARATE LITIGATION PENDING IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON DESCRIBED ABOVE, MOTOROLA IS ENJOINED FROM TAKING STEPS TO ENFORCE THE GERMAN INJUNCTION. DAMAGES WOULD BE DETERMINED IN LATER PROCEEDINGS. MICROSOFT HAS APPEALED THE RULINGS OF

THE FIRST INSTANCE COURT.



MOTOROLA ASSERTS ONE OF THE PATENTS COVERS CERTAIN SYNCING FUNCTIONALITY IN THE ACTIVESYNC PROTOCOL EMPLOYED BY WINDOWS PHONE 7, OUTLOOK MOBILE, HOTMAIL

MOBILE, EXCHANGE ONLINE, EXCHANGE SERVER, AND HOTMAIL SERVER. MOTOROLA SEEKS DAMAGES AND AN INJUNCTION. IN MAY 2012, THE COURT INVITED FURTHER ARGUMENT AND EVIDENCE FROM THE PARTIES RELATING TO MICROSOFTS PRIOR USE DEFENSE. IF THE

COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF MOTOROLA, AN INJUNCTION COULD BE ISSUED IMMEDIATELY RELATING TO THESE PRODUCTS EMPLOYING THE ACTIVESYNC PROTOCOL IN GERMANY, WHICH MOTOROLA COULD THEN TAKE STEPS TO ENFORCE. WE EXPECT THE COURT TO ISSUE A RULING IN AUGUST

2012. DAMAGES WOULD BE DETERMINED IN LATER PROCEEDINGS.



SHOULD INJUNCTION ORDERS BE ISSUED AND ENFORCED BY MOTOROLA, MICROSOFT MAY BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACT BY ALTERING ITS PRODUCTS SO THEY DO NOT

INFRINGE THE MOTOROLA PATENTS.

IN LAWSUITS MICROSOFT FILED IN GERMANY IN SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER, AND DECEMBER 2011 AND IN

APRIL 2012, MICROSOFT ASSERTS MOTOROLA ANDROID DEVICES INFRINGE MICROSOFT PATENTS. MICROSOFT SEEKS DAMAGES AND AN INJUNCTION. IN MAY 2012, THE COURT ISSUED AN INJUNCTION ON ONE PATENT AGAINST MOTOROLA ANDROID DEVICES IN GERMANY AND RULED AGAINST

MICROSOFT ON A SECOND PATENT. IF THE COURT RULES IN FAVOR OF MICROSOFT IN A GIVEN CASE, AN INJUNCTION COULD BE ISSUED IMMEDIATELY RELATING TO THE SALE OF THE INFRINGING DEVICES IN GERMANY, WHICH MICROSOFT COULD THEN TAKE STEPS TO ENFORCE. DAMAGES

WOULD BE DETERMINED IN LATER PROCEEDINGS. MOTOROLA HAS APPEALED THE FIRST INSTANCE COURTS RULING IN MICROSOFTS FAVOR.

UNITED KINGDOM

IN DECEMBER 2011, MICROSOFT FILED AN ACTION AGAINST MOTOROLA IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE, CHANCERY DIVISION, PATENTS COURT, IN

LONDON, ENGLAND, SEEKING TO REVOKE THE UK PART OF THE EUROPEAN PATENT ASSERTED BY MOTOROLA IN GERMANY AGAINST THE ACTIVESYNC PROTOCOL. IN FEBRUARY 2012, MOTOROLA COUNTERCLAIMED ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF THE PATENT AND SEEKING DAMAGES AND AN

INJUNCTION. A TRIAL IS EXPECTED IN DECEMBER 2012.

OTHER PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS

IN ADDITION TO THESE CASES, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 60 OTHER PATENT INFRINGEMENT CASES PENDING AGAINST MICROSOFT.

OTHER

WE ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF

OTHER CLAIMS AND SUITS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT RESOLVING CLAIMS AGAINST US, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THESE MATTERS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, WE HAD ACCRUED AGGREGATE LIABILITIES OF $384 MILLION IN OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES AND $220 MILLION IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES FOR ALL OF OUR CONTINGENT LEGAL MATTERS. WHILE WE INTEND

TO DEFEND THESE MATTERS VIGOROUSLY, ADVERSE OUTCOMES THAT WE ESTIMATE COULD REACH APPROXIMATELY $550 MILLION IN AGGREGATE BEYOND RECORDED AMOUNTS ARE REASONABLY POSSIBLE. WERE UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOMES TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A

MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECTS BECOME REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

STOCK PLANS (EXCLUDING STOCK OPTIONS)

STOCK AWARDS

STOCK AWARDS (SAS) ARE GRANTS THAT ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO SHARES OF

MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK AS THE AWARD VESTS. OUR SAS GENERALLY VEST OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.

SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS

SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS (SPSAS) ARE A FORM OF SA IN WHICH THE NUMBER OF SHARES ULTIMATELY RECEIVED DEPENDS ON OUR BUSINESS

PERFORMANCE AGAINST SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE TARGETS.

WE GRANTED SPSAS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2012, 2011, AND 2010 WITH PERFORMANCE PERIODS OF

JULY 1, 2011 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2012, JULY 1, 2010 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2011, AND JULY 1, 2009 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2010, RESPECTIVELY. IN AUGUST FOLLOWING THE END OF EACH PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK

SUBJECT TO THE AWARD IS DETERMINED BY MULTIPLYING THE TARGET AWARD BY A PERCENTAGE RANGING FROM 0% TO 150%. THE PERCENTAGE IS BASED ON PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. AN ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF SHARES, APPROXIMATELY 12% OF THE TOTAL TARGET SPSAS, ARE AVAILABLE AS ADDITIONAL AWARDS TO PARTICIPANTS BASED ON INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE. ONE-QUARTER OF THE SHARES OF STOCK SUBJECT TO EACH

AWARD VEST FOLLOWING THE END OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, AND AN ADDITIONAL ONE-QUARTER OF THE SHARES VEST ON EACH OF THE FOLLOWING THREE ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT DATE.

EXECUTIVE OFFICER INCENTIVE PLAN

UNDER THE EXECUTIVE OFFICER INCENTIVE PLAN

(EOIP), THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AWARDS PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS FOR SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE PERIODS. DURING THE PERIODS REPORTED, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WERE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ANNUAL AWARDS COMPRISING CASH

AND SAS FROM AN AGGREGATE INCENTIVE POOL EQUAL TO A PERCENTAGE OF CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME. FOR FISCAL YEARS 2012, 2011, AND 2010, THE POOL WAS 0.3%, 0.25%, AND 0.45% OF OPERATING INCOME, RESPECTIVELY.

IN SEPTEMBER FOLLOWING THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR, EACH EXECUTIVE OFFICER MAY RECEIVE A COMBINED CASH AND SA AWARD WITH A TOTAL VALUE EQUAL TO A

FIXED PERCENTAGE OF THE AGGREGATE POOL. THE FIXED PERCENTAGE RANGES BETWEEN 0% AND 150% OF A TARGET BASED ON AN ASSESSMENT OF THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS PERFORMANCE DURING THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR. FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE AWARDS, 20% OF THE AWARD

IS PAYABLE TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN CASH, AND THE REMAINING 80% IS CONVERTED INTO AN SA FOR SHARES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK. THE NUMBER OF SHARES SUBJECT TO THE SA PORTION OF THE AWARD IS DETERMINED BY DIVIDING THE VALUE OF 80% OF THE TOTAL

AWARD BY THE CLOSING PRICE OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK ON THE LAST BUSINESS DAY IN AUGUST OF EACH YEAR. THE SA PORTION OF THE AWARD VESTS ONE-QUARTER IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE AWARD IS APPROVED FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR-END AND ONE-QUARTER ON

AUGUST 31 OF EACH OF THE FOLLOWING THREE YEARS.

THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD WAS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND

WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE HAVE EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS REQUIRED BY EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(B) AS OF THE END OF

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR THE COMPANY. INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES MAINTAINING RECORDS THAT IN REASONABLE DETAIL ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT OUR TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY FOR PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF COMPANY ASSETS ARE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZATION; AND PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF COMPANY ASSETS

THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT A

MISSTATEMENT OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED.

MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED

THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF JUNE 30, 2012. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2012 THAT HAVE MATERIALLY

AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP HAS AUDITED OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2012; THEIR REPORT IS INCLUDED IN

ITEM 9A

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF

JUNE 30, 2012, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE

ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL

WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT

PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR

UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE

ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH

AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL

EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE

POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2012,

BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2012, OF THE

COMPANY AND OUR REPORT DATED JULY 26, 2012, EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
