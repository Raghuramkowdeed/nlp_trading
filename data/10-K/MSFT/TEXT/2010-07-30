COMPETITION

ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES

BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, FREQUENT INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TITLES, AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT PRICE

COMPETITION. WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUED PRICING PRESSURE FROM OUR COMPETITORS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE RESPONDED TO THIS PRESSURE BY REDUCING PRICES ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS. OUR COMPETITORS VARY IN SIZE FROM VERY SMALL COMPANIES WITH LIMITED RESOURCES

TO VERY LARGE, DIVERSIFIED CORPORATIONS WITH SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL AND MARKETING RESOURCES. WE COMPETE PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF PRODUCT INNOVATION, QUALITY AND VARIETY, TIMING OF PRODUCT RELEASES, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING.

OUR XBOX GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS COMPETES WITH CONSOLE PLATFORMS FROM NINTENDO AND SONY, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE A LARGE,

ESTABLISHED BASE OF CUSTOMERS. THE LIFECYCLE FOR GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES AVERAGES FIVE TO 10 YEARS. WE RELEASED XBOX 360, OUR SECOND GENERATION CONSOLE, IN NOVEMBER 2005. NINTENDO AND SONY RELEASED NEW VERSIONS OF THEIR GAME CONSOLES IN

LATE 2006. WE BELIEVE THE SUCCESS OF GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES IS DETERMINED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF GAMES FOR THE CONSOLE, PROVIDING EXCLUSIVE GAME CONTENT THAT GAMERS SEEK, THE COMPUTATIONAL POWER AND RELIABILITY OF THE CONSOLE, AND THE

ABILITY TO CREATE NEW EXPERIENCES VIA ONLINE SERVICES, DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT, AND PERIPHERALS. WE THINK THE XBOX 360 IS POSITIONED WELL AGAINST COMPETITIVE CONSOLE PRODUCTS BASED ON SIGNIFICANT INNOVATION IN HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE, NEW DEVELOPER

TOOLS, ONLINE GAMING SERVICES, AND CONTINUED STRONG EXCLUSIVE CONTENT FROM OUR OWN GAME FRANCHISES. IN ADDITION TO COMPETING AGAINST SOFTWARE PUBLISHED FOR NON-XBOX PLATFORMS, OUR GAMES BUSINESS ALSO COMPETES WITH NUMEROUS COMPANIES THAT WE HAVE

LICENSED TO DEVELOP AND PUBLISH SOFTWARE FOR THE XBOX CONSOLES.

WINDOWS PHONE FACES COMPETITION FROM APPLE, GOOGLE, NOKIA, OPENWAVE

SYSTEMS, PALM, QUALCOMM, RESEARCH IN MOTION, AND SYMBIAN. THE EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEM BUSINESS IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED WITH MANY COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. KEY COMPETITORS INCLUDE IBM, INTEL, AND VERSIONS OF EMBEDDABLE LINUX FROM COMMERCIAL LINUX VENDORS

SUCH AS METROWERKS AND MONTAVISTA SOFTWARE.

ZUNE COMPETES WITH APPLE AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS OF DIGITAL MUSIC AND ENTERTAINMENT

DEVICES. OUR PC HARDWARE PRODUCTS FACE AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION FROM COMPUTER AND OTHER HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS, MANY OF WHICH ARE ALSO CURRENT OR POTENTIAL PARTNERS. MEDIAROOM FACES COMPETITION PRIMARILY FROM A VARIETY OF COMPETITORS THAT PROVIDE

ELEMENTS OF AN INTERNET PROTOCOL TELEVISION DELIVERY PLATFORM, BUT THAT DO NOT PROVIDE END-TO-END SOLUTIONS FOR THE NETWORK OPERATOR.

THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENTED 14%, 15%, AND 14%, RESPECTIVELY, OF REVENUE IN EACH OF THOSE YEARS. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

WHILE MOST OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY, WE ALSO PURCHASE TECHNOLOGY, LICENSE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND OVERSEE

THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND LOCALIZATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE WE ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT UPON LICENSES AND OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS. INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS US TO MAINTAIN

CLOSER TECHNICAL CONTROL OVER OUR PRODUCTS. IT ALSO GIVES US THE FREEDOM TO DECIDE WHICH MODIFICATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. GENERALLY, WE ALSO CREATE PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION INTERNALLY. WE STRIVE TO

OBTAIN INFORMATION AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE ABOUT CHANGING USAGE PATTERNS AND HARDWARE ADVANCES THAT MAY AFFECT SOFTWARE DESIGN. BEFORE RELEASING NEW SOFTWARE PLATFORMS, WE PROVIDE APPLICATION VENDORS WITH A RANGE OF RESOURCES AND GUIDELINES FOR

DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, AND TESTING.

INVESTING IN BUSINESS AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

INNOVATION IS THE FOUNDATION FOR MICROSOFTS SUCCESS. OUR MODEL FOR GROWTH IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO INITIATE AND EMBRACE DISRUPTIVE

TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, TO ENTER NEW MARKETS, BOTH IN TERMS OF GEOGRAPHIES AND PRODUCT AREAS, AND TO DRIVE BROAD ADOPTION OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE DEVELOP AND MARKET. WE MAINTAIN OUR LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACROSS A WIDE

SPECTRUM OF TECHNOLOGIES, TOOLS, AND PLATFORMS SPANNING COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION; INFORMATION ACCESS AND ORGANIZATION; ENTERTAINMENT; BUSINESS AND E-COMMERCE; ADVERTISING; AND DEVICES.

INCREASINGLY, WE ARE TAKING A GLOBAL APPROACH TO INNOVATION. WHILE OUR MAIN RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN THE UNITED STATES, IN REDMOND, WASHINGTON, WE ALSO OPERATE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING CANADA, CHINA, DENMARK, ENGLAND, INDIA, IRELAND,

AND ISRAEL. THIS GLOBAL APPROACH WILL HELP US REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN LOCAL MARKETS AND ENABLE US TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT TOP TALENT FROM ACROSS THE WORLD.

WE INVEST IN INNOVATION BY FOCUSING ON THE EMERGING TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND BREAKTHROUGHS THAT WE BELIEVE OFFER SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER

VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY. MICROSOFT RESEARCH IS ONE OF THE WORLDS LARGEST COMPUTER SCIENCE RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS, AND WORKS IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH TOP UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD TO ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART

IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, PROVIDING US A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON FUTURE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS.

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS

AND OUR BROAD FOCUS ON LONG-TERM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AREAS WHERE WE SEE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE FUTURE GROWTH INCLUDE.

CLOUD COMPUTING AND SOFTWARE PLUS SERVICES

THE ABILITY TO COMBINE THE POWER OF DESKTOP AND SERVER SOFTWARE WITH THE REACH OF THE INTERNET IS CREATING IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES

FOR GROWTH IN ALMOST EVERY ONE OF OUR BUSINESSES. ACCORDINGLY, WE ARE FOCUSED ON INNOVATION AND BROADENING OUR PLATFORM TO DEVELOP A CLOUD COMPUTING ECOSYSTEM THAT POSITIONS US FOR SUCCESS IN AREAS INCLUDING VIRTUALIZATION, MANAGEMENT, AND SECURITY

IDENTITY. WE ARE ALSO FOCUSED ON DELIVERING END-TO-END EXPERIENCES THAT CONNECT USERS TO INFORMATION, COMMUNICATIONS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND PEOPLE IN NEW WAYS ACROSS THEIR LIVES AT HOME, AT WORK, AND THE BROADEST POSSIBLE RANGE OF MOBILE SCENARIOS

THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN DATACENTERS; NEW VERSIONS OF WINDOWS AND OFFICE THAT ARE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT A WIDE RANGE OF CONNECTED SCENARIOS; SOLUTIONS FOR BUSINESSES THAT CAN BE DEPLOYED BY A CUSTOMER, BY A SERVICE PROVIDER LIKE MICROSOFT, OR BY A

MICROSOFT PARTNER; TOOLS FOR DEVELOPERS AND WEB DESIGNERS; AND CONSUMER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDING XBOX 360, XBOX LIVE, WINDOWS LIVE SERVICES AND ZUNE.

NATURAL USER INTERFACES

THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL ALSO SEE DRAMATIC CHANGES IN THE WAY PEOPLE INTERACT WITH TECHNOLOGY AS TOUCH, GESTURES, HANDWRITING, AND

SPEECH RECOGNITION BECOME A NORMAL PART OF HOW WE CONTROL DEVICES. THIS WILL MAKE TECHNOLOGY MORE ACCESSIBLE AND SIMPLER TO USE AND WILL CREATE OPPORTUNITIES TO REACH NEW MARKETS AND DELIVER NEW KINDS OF COMPUTING EXPERIENCES. OUR LONG-TERM

INVESTMENTS IN NATURAL USER INTERFACES CAN BE SEEN IN PRODUCTS LIKE WINDOWS 7, THE MICROSOFT AUTO SOFTWARE PLATFORM AND KINECT FOR XBOX 360. WE BELIEVE SENSORY INPUT IS JUST ONE ASPECT OF NATURAL USER INTERFACE TECHNOLOGY, AND WE ARE RESEARCHING THE

IMPACT OF SEVERAL INTERACTION PARADIGMS SUCH AS CONTEXTUAL AWARENESS AND ENVIRONMENTAL AWARENESS.

NEW SCENARIO

INNOVATION IN KEY INDUSTRIES

CONTINUING IMPROVEMENT IN THE POWER OF COMPUTERS AND DEVICES AND THE SPEED AND

UBIQUITY OF NETWORKS IS CREATING OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER INNOVATION THAT WILL TRANSFORM A NUMBER OF KEY INDUSTRIES AND ADDRESS SIGNIFICANT GLOBAL ISSUES INCLUDING HEALTHCARE, ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY, AND EDUCATION. IN HEALTHCARE, FOR EXAMPLE,

COMPUTING WILL CONNECT PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION TO MEDICAL RESEARCH AND HELP MAKE HEALTHCARE MORE PREVENTIVE, PERSONALIZED, AND COST-EFFECTIVE. TODAY, MICROSOFT PRODUCTS SUCH AS HEALTHVAULT AND AMALGA HELP INDIVIDUALS MANAGE THEIR PERSONAL HEALTH

AND ENABLE HEALTHCARE PROFESSIONALS TO INTEGRATE RESEARCH AND HEALTH INFORMATION SO THEY CAN DELIVER MORE EFFECTIVE CARE. WE ALSO BELIEVE THAT WE ARE ENTERING A PERIOD WHERE PERSONAL COMPUTERS WILL PLAY AN INCREASINGLY IMPORTANT ROLE IN VIRTUALLY

EVERY FIELD OF SCIENTIFIC RESEARCH AND DISCOVERY.

INTELLIGENT COMPUTING

AS COMPUTING POWER INCREASES, OUR ABILITY TO BUILD SOFTWARE THAT HAS THE INTELLIGENCE TO UNDERSTAND A USERS PREFERENCES BASED

ON THE TOOLS AND INFORMATION THEY HAVE ACCESSED IN THE PAST AND ANTICIPATE THEIR FUTURE NEEDS IS RAPIDLY IMPROVING. THIS DEVELOPMENT WILL ENABLE US TO DELIVER A NEW GENERATION OF SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS THAT MAKE PEOPLE MORE PRODUCTIVE BY ENABLING THEM

TO FOCUS MORE ON WHAT THEY WANT TO ACCOMPLISH AND LESS ON THE STEPS NEEDED TO USE TECHNOLOGY.

DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING

WE MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRIMARILY THROUGH THE FOLLOWING CHANNELS: OEM; DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS; AND

ONLINE.

OEM

WE LICENSE OUR

SOFTWARE TO OEMS FOR DISTRIBUTION AS PRE-INSTALLED SOFTWARE ON NEW PCS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT PART OF THE OEM BUSINESS FOR US IS LICENSING OF THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM. WE ALSO LICENSE TO OEMS CERTAIN SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS AND DESKTOP

APPLICATIONS SUCH AS OUR MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND CONSUMER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO LICENSING THEM SOFTWARE, WE MARKET THROUGH OEMS HARDWARE DEVICES AND SOFTWARE AS SERVICES, INCLUDING OUR WINDOWS LIVE ESSENTIALS SUITE. WE HAVE OEM

AGREEMENTS COVERING ONE OR MORE OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE MULTINATIONAL OEMS, INCLUDING ACER, ASUSTEK, DELL, FUJITSU, HEWLETT-PACKARD, LENOVO, NEC, SAMSUNG, SONY, AND TOSHIBA, AND THE REGIONAL OEMS, INCLUDING MEDION, MSI, AND

POSITIVO. IN ADDITION, A PORTION OF THE OEM BUSINESS IS ALSO CONDUCTED WITH SYSTEM BUILDERS, WHICH ARE LOW-VOLUME, CUSTOMIZED PC VENDORS OPERATING IN LOCAL MARKETS.

DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS

WE LICENSE

SOFTWARE TO ORGANIZATIONS UNDER ARRANGEMENTS THAT ALLOW THE END-USER CUSTOMER TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. ORGANIZATIONS LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRIMARILY THROUGH LARGE ACCOUNT RESELLERS (LARS),

DISTRIBUTORS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS (VARS), OEMS, SYSTEM BUILDER CHANNELS AND RETAILERS. ADDITIONALLY, SOLUTION INTEGRATORS, INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS, WEB AGENCIES AND DEVELOPERS ADVISE ORGANIZATIONS ON THE ACQUISITION OF LICENSES OF

OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT LICENSE PRODUCTS THROUGH ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS TRANSACT DIRECTLY WITH US, WITH SALES SUPPORT FROM OUR ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISOR CHANNEL PARTNERS. THESE ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISORS TYPICALLY ARE

ALSO AUTHORIZED AS LARS AND OPERATE AS RESELLERS FOR OUR OTHER LICENSING PROGRAMS. ALTHOUGH EACH TYPE OF RESELLING PARTNER REACHES ORGANIZATIONS OF ALL SIZES, LARS ARE PRIMARILY ENGAGED WITH LARGE ORGANIZATIONS. DISTRIBUTORS RESELL PRIMARILY TO VARS

AND VARS TYPICALLY REACH THE SMALL-SIZED AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS. SOME OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS INCLUDE INGRAM MICRO AND TECH DATA, AND SOME OF OUR LARGEST RESELLERS INCLUDE CDW, DELL, INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, AND SOFTWARE HOUSE INTERNATIONAL. OUR

MICROSOFT DYNAMICS SOFTWARE OFFERINGS ARE LICENSED TO ENTERPRISES THROUGH A GLOBAL NETWORK OF CHANNEL PARTNERS PROVIDING VERTICAL SOLUTIONS AND SPECIALIZED SERVICES. WE DISTRIBUTE OUR RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT

NON-EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORS, AUTHORIZED REPLICATORS, RESELLERS, AND RETAIL OUTLETS. INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS OBTAIN OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH RETAIL OUTLETS, INCLUDING BEST BUY, TARGET, AND WAL-MART. WE HAVE A NETWORK OF FIELD SALES REPRESENTATIVES

AND FIELD SUPPORT PERSONNEL THAT SOLICITS ORDERS FROM DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS, AND PROVIDES PRODUCT TRAINING AND SALES SUPPORT.

OUR

ARRANGEMENTS FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THEM WITH A MEANS OF DOING SO WITHOUT HAVING TO ACQUIRE SEPARATE PACKAGED PRODUCT THROUGH RETAIL CHANNELS. IN DELIVERING ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSING

ARRANGEMENTS TO THE MARKET, WE USE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONS OF VARIOUS SIZES. WHILE THESE PROGRAMS MAY DIFFER IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD, GENERALLY THEY INCLUDE.

OPEN LICENSING

DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR SMALL-TO-MEDIUM ORGANIZATIONS (5 TO OVER 250 LICENSES), THESE PROGRAMS ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL

OR SUBSCRIPTION LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE

11

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1

PRODUCTS OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (TWO OR THREE YEARS DEPENDING ON THE OPEN PROGRAM USED). THE OFFERING THAT CONVEYS RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OVER THE CONTRACT

PERIOD IS CALLED SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. SOFTWARE ASSURANCE ALSO PROVIDES SUPPORT, TOOLS, AND TRAINING TO HELP CUSTOMERS DEPLOY AND USE SOFTWARE EFFICIENTLY. UNDER THE OPEN PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS CAN ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY, OR LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE

ASSURANCE. THEY CAN ALSO RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS.

SELECT LICENSING

DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR MEDIUM-TO-LARGE ORGANIZATIONS (GREATER THAN 250 LICENSES), THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO

ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, SOFTWARE ASSURANCE OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY THREE YEARS OR LESS). SIMILAR TO THE OPEN PROGRAM, THE SELECT PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY, ACQUIRE

LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, OR RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS.

ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT LICENSING

ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS ARE TARGETED AT MEDIUM AND LARGE ORGANIZATIONS (GREATER THAN 250 LICENSES) THAT WANT TO ACQUIRE LICENSES TO

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, ALONG WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, FOR ALL OR SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF THEIR ENTERPRISE. ENTERPRISES CAN ELECT TO EITHER ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES OR, UNDER THE ENTERPRISE SUBSCRIPTION PROGRAM, CAN ACQUIRE NON-PERPETUAL, SUBSCRIPTION

AGREEMENTS FOR A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY THREE YEARS). ONLINE SERVICES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE THROUGH THE ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT AND SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED WITH THREE YEAR TERMS.

ONLINE

ALTHOUGH CLIENT-BASED SOFTWARE WILL

CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS, INCREASINGLY WE ARE DELIVERING GREATER VALUE TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. WE HAVE AN EXPANDING PORTFOLIO OF PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SOLUTIONS THAT WE MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE ONLINE. WE

PROVIDE ONLINE CONTENT AND SERVICES TO CONSUMERS THROUGH BING, WINDOWS LIVE ESSENTIALS SUITE, MICROSOFT OFFICE WEB APPS, OUR MSN PORTALS AND CHANNELS, AND XBOX LIVE. WE PROVIDE CONTENT AND SERVICES TO BUSINESS USERS THROUGH THE MICROSOFT ONLINE

SERVICES PLATFORM, WHICH INCLUDES CLOUD-BASED SERVICES SUCH AS WINDOWS AZURE, SQL AZURE, MICROSOFT DYNAMICS CRM ONLINE, SHAREPOINT ONLINE, EXCHANGE ONLINE, AND OFFICE COMMUNICATIONS. OTHER SERVICES DELIVERED ONLINE INCLUDE OUR ONLINE ADVERTISING

PLATFORM WITH OFFERINGS FOR BOTH PUBLISHERS AND ADVERTISERS, AS WELL AS MICROSOFT DEVELOPER NETWORKS SUBSCRIPTION CONTENT AND UPDATES, PERIODIC PRODUCT UPDATES, AND ONLINE TECHNICAL AND PRACTICE READINESS RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR PARTNERS IN

DEVELOPING AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS.

CUSTOMERS

OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS, SMALL-SIZED AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS, ENTERPRISES, GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS, EDUCATIONAL

INSTITUTIONS, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, APPLICATION DEVELOPERS, AND OEMS. CONSUMERS AND SMALL-SIZED AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS OBTAIN OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS AND OEMS. NO SALES TO AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED

FOR MORE THAN 10% OF FISCAL YEAR 2010, 2009, OR 2008 REVENUE. OUR PRACTICE IS TO SHIP OUR PRODUCTS PROMPTLY UPON RECEIPT OF PURCHASE ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS; CONSEQUENTLY, BACKLOG IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

THE CLOUD-BASED

COMPUTING MODEL PRESENTS EXECUTION AND COMPETITIVE RISKS.

WE ARE TRANSITIONING TO A COMPUTING ENVIRONMENT CHARACTERIZED BY CLOUD-BASED SERVICES USED WITH SMART CLIENT DEVICES. OUR COMPETITORS ARE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING AND

DEPLOYING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. PRICING AND DELIVERY MODELS ARE EVOLVING. DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS INFLUENCE HOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP OUR OWN

COMPETING CLOUD-BASED SOFTWARE PLUS SERVICES STRATEGIES. WHILE WE BELIEVE OUR EXPERTISE, INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE BREADTH OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES PROVIDES US WITH A STRONG FOUNDATION TO COMPETE, IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER OUR

STRATEGIES WILL ATTRACT THE USERS OR GENERATE THE REVENUE REQUIRED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN ADDITION TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS, WE ARE INCURRING COSTS TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES. THESE COSTS MAY REDUCE

THE OPERATING MARGINS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY ACHIEVED. WHETHER WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS NEW BUSINESS MODEL DEPENDS ON OUR EXECUTION IN A NUMBER OF AREAS, INCLUDING.



CONTINUING TO INNOVATE AND BRING TO MARKET COMPELLING CLOUD-BASED EXPERIENCES THAT GENERATE INCREASING TRAFFIC AND MARKET SHARE;



MAINTAINING THE UTILITY, COMPATIBILITY AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ON THE GROWING ARRAY OF COMPUTING DEVICES, INCLUDING SMARTPHONES, HANDHELD

COMPUTERS, NETBOOKS, TABLETS AND TELEVISION SET TOP DEVICES; AND



CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR CLOUD PLATFORMS TO THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS.

CHALLENGES TO OUR BUSINESS MODELS MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUES OR OPERATING MARGINS.

WHETHER OUR SOFTWARE RUNS IN THE

CLOUD OR ON A DEVICE, WE CONTINUE TO FACE CHALLENGES FROM ALTERNATIVE MEANS OF DEVELOPING AND LICENSING SOFTWARE. UNDER OUR LICENSE-BASED SOFTWARE MODEL, SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS BEAR THE COSTS OF CONVERTING ORIGINAL IDEAS INTO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THROUGH

INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OFFSETTING THESE COSTS WITH THE REVENUE RECEIVED FROM THE DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR PRODUCTS. CERTAIN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE BUSINESS MODELS CHALLENGE OUR LICENSE-BASED SOFTWARE MODEL. OPEN SOURCE

COMMONLY REFERS TO SOFTWARE WHOSE SOURCE CODE IS SUBJECT TO A LICENSE ALLOWING IT TO BE MODIFIED, COMBINED WITH OTHER SOFTWARE AND REDISTRIBUTED, SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THE LICENSE. A NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS COMPETE WITH US USING AN

OPEN SOURCE BUSINESS MODEL BY MODIFYING AND THEN DISTRIBUTING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE TO END USERS AT NOMINAL COST AND EARNING REVENUE ON COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. THESE FIRMS DO NOT BEAR THE FULL COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE

SOFTWARE. IN SOME CASES, THEIR PRODUCTS MAY INFRINGE PATENTS GRANTED TO MICROSOFT FOR OUR INVENTIONS. TO THE EXTENT OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE GAINS INCREASING MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OUR SALES, REVENUE, AND OPERATING MARGINS MAY DECLINE.

AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN TO CREATE PLATFORM-BASED ECOSYSTEMS ON WHICH MANY PARTICIPANTS CAN BUILD DIVERSE SOLUTIONS. A

COMPETING VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED MODEL, IN WHICH A SINGLE FIRM CONTROLS BOTH THE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ELEMENTS OF A PRODUCT, HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH CERTAIN CONSUMER PRODUCTS SUCH AS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, MOBILE PHONES, AND DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS. WE

ALSO OFFER VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS; HOWEVER, EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH THE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MODEL MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF SALES AND REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION.

WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE INTENSE COMPETITION ACROSS ALL MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES. OUR COMPETITORS RANGE IN SIZE FROM FORTUNE 100 COMPANIES TO SMALL, SPECIALIZED SINGLE-PRODUCT BUSINESSES AND OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY-BASED PROJECTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE BREADTH OF OUR BUSINESSES AND PRODUCT PORTFOLIO IS A COMPETITIVE

ADVANTAGE, OUR COMPETITORS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON NARROWER PRODUCT LINES MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEVOTING TECHNICAL, MARKETING, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO COMPETE WITH US. IN ADDITION, BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN OUR BUSINESSES GENERALLY ARE LOW AND

PRODUCTS, ONCE DEVELOPED, CAN BE DISTRIBUTED BROADLY AND QUICKLY AT RELATIVELY LOW COST. OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE VENDORS ARE DEVOTING CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS TO DEVELOPING SOFTWARE THAT MIMICS THE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, IN SOME CASES

IN VIOLATION OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS OR ON THE BASIS OF TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE MAKE AVAILABLE AT LITTLE OR NO COST IN

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1A

CONNECTION WITH OUR INTEROPERABILITY INITIATIVES. IN RESPONSE TO COMPETITION, WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH BASIC FUNCTIONALITY THAT ARE SOLD AT LOWER PRICES THAN THE

STANDARD VERSIONS. THESE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES MAY RESULT IN DECREASED SALES VOLUMES, PRICE REDUCTIONS, AND/OR INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, SUCH AS FOR MARKETING AND SALES INCENTIVES, RESULTING IN LOWER REVENUE, GROSS MARGINS, AND OPERATING INCOME.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

PROTECTING OUR GLOBAL

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND COMBATING UNLICENSED COPYING AND USE OF SOFTWARE AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DIFFICULT. WHILE PIRACY ADVERSELY AFFECTS U.S. REVENUE, THE IMPACT ON REVENUE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS MORE SIGNIFICANT,

PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE LAWS ARE LESS PROTECTIVE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. AS A RESULT, OUR REVENUE IN THESE MARKETS LIKELY WILL GROW SLOWER THAN THE UNDERLYING PC MARKET. SIMILARLY, THE ABSENCE OF HARMONIZED PATENT LAWS MAKES IT MORE

DIFFICULT TO ENSURE CONSISTENT RESPECT FOR PATENT RIGHTS. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WE ACTIVELY EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF LICENSING GENUINE PRODUCTS AND OBTAINING INDEMNIFICATION BENEFITS FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS, AND WE EDUCATE

LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF A BUSINESS CLIMATE WHERE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. HOWEVER, CONTINUED EDUCATIONAL AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS MAY FAIL TO ENHANCE REVENUE. REDUCTIONS IN THE LEGAL PROTECTION FOR SOFTWARE INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUE.

THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

RIGHTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME WE RECEIVE NOTICES FROM OTHERS CLAIMING WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE NUMBER OF THESE CLAIMS MAY GROW. TO RESOLVE THESE CLAIMS WE MAY ENTER INTO ROYALTY AND LICENSING

AGREEMENTS ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS, STOP SELLING OR REDESIGN AFFECTED PRODUCTS, OR PAY DAMAGES TO SATISFY INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. SUCH AGREEMENTS MAY CAUSE OPERATING MARGINS TO DECLINE. WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE

MAKING SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES TO SETTLE CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO MANAGE THIS RISK.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR SOURCE CODE FROM COPYING IF THERE IS AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE

CODE.

SOURCE CODE, THE DETAILED PROGRAM COMMANDS FOR OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND OTHER SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH WE LICENSE PORTIONS OF OUR APPLICATION AND OPERATING SYSTEM SOURCE CODE TO A

NUMBER OF LICENSEES, WE TAKE SIGNIFICANT MEASURES TO PROTECT THE SECRECY OF LARGE PORTIONS OF OUR SOURCE CODE. IF AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SOURCE CODE OCCURS, WE COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE FUTURE TRADE SECRET PROTECTION

FOR THAT SOURCE CODE. THIS COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR THIRD PARTIES TO COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS BY COPYING FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE CODE ALSO COULD INCREASE THE

SECURITY RISKS DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUES

OR TO LIABILITY CLAIMS.

MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF COMPUTERS AND COMPUTER NETWORKS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR US AND OUR CUSTOMERS. HACKERS DEVELOP AND DEPLOY VIRUSES, WORMS, AND OTHER MALICIOUS SOFTWARE PROGRAMS THAT ATTACK

OUR PRODUCTS AND GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORKS AND DATA CENTERS. ALTHOUGH THIS IS AN INDUSTRY-WIDE PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS COMPUTERS ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS, IT AFFECTS OUR PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE HACKERS TEND TO FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON THE MOST

POPULAR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND PROGRAMS AND WE EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO SO. WE DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ADDRESS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES THROUGH.



ENGINEERING MORE SECURE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;



ENHANCING SECURITY AND RELIABILITY FEATURES IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;



HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS MAKE THE BEST USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO PROTECT AGAINST COMPUTER VIRUSES AND OTHER ATTACKS;



IMPROVING THE DEPLOYMENT OF SOFTWARE UPDATES TO ADDRESS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES;



INVESTING IN MITIGATION TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP TO SECURE CUSTOMERS FROM ATTACKS EVEN WHEN SUCH SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE NOT DEPLOYED; AND



PROVIDING CUSTOMERS ONLINE AUTOMATED SECURITY TOOLS, PUBLISHED SECURITY GUIDANCE, AND SECURITY SOFTWARE SUCH AS FIREWALLS AND ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE.

THE COST OF THESE STEPS COULD REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED SECURITY

VULNERABILITIES IN OUR PRODUCTS COULD LEAD SOME CUSTOMERS TO SEEK TO RETURN PRODUCTS, TO REDUCE OR DELAY FUTURE

ITEM 1A

PURCHASES, OR TO USE COMPETING PRODUCTS. CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO INCREASE THEIR EXPENDITURES ON PROTECTING THEIR EXISTING COMPUTER SYSTEMS FROM ATTACK, WHICH COULD DELAY ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES.

ANY OF THESE ACTIONS BY CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. IN ADDITION, IF THIRD PARTIES GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORKS OR DATA CENTERS THEY COULD OBTAIN AND EXPLOIT CONFIDENTIAL BUSINESS INFORMATION AND HARM OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

FINALLY, ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED VULNERABILITIES MAY LEAD TO CLAIMS AGAINST US. ALTHOUGH OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE OR LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO SUCH LIABILITY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THESE PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND

ALL LEGAL CHALLENGES.

IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY AND HARM OUR

REPUTATION.

WE STORE AND PROCESS LARGE AMOUNTS OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION AS WE SELL SOFTWARE, PROVIDE SUPPORT AND OFFER CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR SECURITY CONTROLS OVER

PERSONAL DATA, OUR TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES AND VENDORS ON DATA SECURITY, AND OTHER PRACTICES WE FOLLOW MAY NOT PREVENT THE IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF THIS INFORMATION COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION,

LEAD TO LEGAL EXPOSURE TO CUSTOMERS, OR SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY UNDER LAWS THAT PROTECT PERSONAL DATA, RESULTING IN INCREASED COSTS OR LOSS OF REVENUE. OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALSO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO STORE AND PROCESS PERSONAL DATA.

PERCEPTIONS THAT OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COULD INHIBIT SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES.

WE MAY EXPERIENCE OUTAGES, DATA LOSS AND DISRUPTIONS OF OUR ONLINE SERVICES IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE OPERATIONS

INFRASTRUCTURE.

OUR INCREASING USER TRAFFIC AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DEMAND MORE COMPUTING POWER. WE HAVE SPENT AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS TO PURCHASE OR LEASE DATA CENTERS AND

EQUIPMENT AND TO UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TO HANDLE INCREASED TRAFFIC ON OUR WEB SITES AND IN OUR DATA CENTERS, AND TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND SUPPORT EXISTING SERVICES SUCH AS BING, EXCHANGE ONLINE,

SHAREPOINT ONLINE, XBOX LIVE, WINDOWS LIVE, AND MICROSOFT OFFICE WEB APPS. WE ALSO ARE GROWING OUR BUSINESS OF PROVIDING A PLATFORM AND BACK-END HOSTING FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY BUSINESSES TO THEIR END CUSTOMERS. MAINTAINING AND

EXPANDING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS EXPENSIVE AND COMPLEX. INEFFICIENCIES OR OPERATIONAL FAILURES, INCLUDING TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT LOSS OF CUSTOMER DATA, COULD DIMINISH THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND USER EXPERIENCE RESULTING IN

CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY, CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND LOSS OF CURRENT AND POTENTIAL USERS, SUBSCRIBERS, AND ADVERTISERS, EACH OF WHICH MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIVITY THAT AFFECTS HOW WE DESIGN AND MARKET OUR

PRODUCTS.

AS A LEADING GLOBAL SOFTWARE MAKER, WE RECEIVE CLOSE SCRUTINY FROM GOVERNMENT AGENCIES UNDER U.S. AND FOREIGN COMPETITION LAWS. SOME JURISDICTIONS ALSO PROVIDE PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION FOR COMPETITORS OR

CONSUMERS TO ASSERT CLAIMS OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS.

LAWSUITS BROUGHT

BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 18 STATES, AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN TWO SEPARATE ACTIONS WERE RESOLVED THROUGH A CONSENT DECREE THAT TOOK EFFECT IN 2001 AND A FINAL JUDGMENT ENTERED IN 2002. THESE PROCEEDINGS IMPOSED VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS ON

OUR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM BUSINESSES. THESE CONSTRAINTS INCLUDE LIMITS ON CERTAIN CONTRACTING PRACTICES, MANDATED DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE PROGRAM INTERFACES AND PROTOCOLS, AND RIGHTS FOR COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS TO LIMIT THE VISIBILITY OF

CERTAIN WINDOWS FEATURES IN NEW PCS. WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THESE RULES. HOWEVER, IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THEM, ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS COULD BE IMPOSED ON US THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION CLOSELY SCRUTINIZES THE DESIGN OF HIGH-VOLUME MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND THE TERMS ON WHICH WE MAKE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES USED

IN THESE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS FILE FORMATS, PROGRAMMING INTERFACES, AND PROTOCOLS, AVAILABLE TO OTHER COMPANIES. IN 2004, THE COMMISSION ORDERED US TO CREATE NEW VERSIONS OF WINDOWS THAT DO NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN MULTIMEDIA TECHNOLOGIES AND TO PROVIDE OUR

COMPETITORS WITH SPECIFICATIONS FOR HOW TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN PROPRIETARY WINDOWS COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS IN THEIR OWN PRODUCTS. IN 2009, THE COMMISSION ACCEPTED A SET OF COMMITMENTS OFFERED BY MICROSOFT TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSIONS CONCERNS

RELATING TO COMPETITION IN WEB BROWSING SOFTWARE. THE COMMISSIONS IMPACT ON PRODUCT DESIGN MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO INNOVATE IN WINDOWS OR OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE, DIMINISH THE DEVELOPER APPEAL OF THE WINDOWS PLATFORM, AND INCREASE OUR

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. THE AVAILABILITY OF LICENSES RELATED TO PROTOCOLS AND FILE FORMATS MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT BETTER MIMIC THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR OWN PRODUCTS WHICH COULD RESULT IN DECREASED SALES OF

OUR PRODUCTS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATORY ACTIONS AND COURT DECISIONS SUCH AS THESE MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE

THE BENEFITS OF OUR SOFTWARE TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, THEREBY REDUCING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE REVENUES THAT COME FROM THEM. NEW ACTIONS COULD BE INITIATED AT ANY TIME, EITHER BY THESE OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS OR PRIVATE

CLAIMANTS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO NEW VERSIONS OF WINDOWS OR OTHER MICROSOFT PRODUCTS. THE OUTCOME OF SUCH ACTIONS, OR STEPS TAKEN TO AVOID THEM, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING.



WE MAY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WITHDRAWING PRODUCTS FROM CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES TO AVOID FINES OR DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS OF THOSE PRODUCTS

TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT RULINGS, WHICH MAY ENTAIL A DELAY IN A PRODUCT RELEASE AND REMOVING FUNCTIONALITY THAT CUSTOMERS WANT OR ON WHICH DEVELOPERS RELY.



WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE AVAILABLE LICENSES TO OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES ON TERMS THAT DO NOT REFLECT THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE OR DO NOT PROTECT OUR

ASSOCIATED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.



THE RULINGS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY BE CITED AS A PRECEDENT IN OTHER COMPETITION LAW PROCEEDINGS.

OUR SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ONLINE OFFERINGS ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE INTERNET DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY IN MANY AREAS,

INCLUDING USER PRIVACY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, DATA PROTECTION, AND ONLINE CONTENT. THE APPLICATION OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO OUR BUSINESS IS OFTEN UNCLEAR AND SOMETIMES MAY CONFLICT. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REGULATIONS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT

COSTS OR REQUIRE CHANGES IN BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE. NONCOMPLIANCE COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES BEING IMPOSED ON US OR ORDERS THAT WE STOP THE ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANT ACTIVITY.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESS IS BASED ON SUCCESSFULLY

ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENTED EMPLOYEES. THE MARKET FOR HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS AND LEADERS IN OUR INDUSTRY IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT INTERNATIONALLY BY RESTRICTIVE DOMESTIC IMMIGRATION LAWS. IF WE ARE

LESS SUCCESSFUL IN OUR RECRUITING EFFORTS, OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. EFFECTIVE SUCCESSION PLANNING IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO OUR LONG-TERM

SUCCESS. FAILURE TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE AND SMOOTH TRANSITIONS INVOLVING KEY EMPLOYEES COULD HINDER OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING AND EXECUTION.

DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS A

COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS. NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS CAN REQUIRE LONG DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PERIODS. OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON CLOUD-BASED SOFTWARE PLUS SERVICES ALSO PRESENTS NEW AND COMPLEX DEVELOPMENT ISSUES.

SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE RELEASES OR SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN CREATING NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE.

OUR GROWTH DEPENDS ON OUR

ABILITY TO INNOVATE BY OFFERING NEW, AND ADDING VALUE TO OUR EXISTING, SOFTWARE AND SERVICE OFFERINGS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING FOR NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING

THE WINDOWS PC OPERATING SYSTEM, THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, XBOX 360, BING, WINDOWS SERVER, ZUNE, WINDOWS LIVE, THE WINDOWS AZURE SERVICES PLATFORM, AND OTHER CLOUD-BASED SERVICES OFFERINGS. INVESTMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGY ARE SPECULATIVE.

COMMERCIAL SUCCESS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING INNOVATIVENESS, DEVELOPER SUPPORT, AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING. OUR DEGREE OF SUCCESS WITH WINDOWS PHONE, FOR EXAMPLE, WILL IMPACT OUR ABILITY TO GROW SHARE OF THE SMARTPHONE

OPERATING SYSTEM MARKET. IT WILL ALSO BE AN IMPORTANT FACTOR IN SUPPORTING OUR STRATEGY OF DELIVERING VALUE TO END USERS SEAMLESSLY OVER PC, PHONE, AND TV DEVICE CLASSES. IF CUSTOMERS DO NOT PERCEIVE OUR LATEST OFFERINGS AS PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT NEW

FUNCTIONALITY OR OTHER VALUE, THEY MAY REDUCE THEIR PURCHASES OF NEW SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES, UNFAVORABLY IMPACTING REVENUE. WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE INVESTMENTS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, IF AT ALL.

MOREOVER, NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE, AND EVEN IF THEY ARE PROFITABLE, OPERATING MARGINS FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES MAY NOT BE AS HIGH AS THE MARGINS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORICALLY.

ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS.

UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INFLATION,

RECESSION, OR OTHER CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MAY RESULT IN LOWER INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SPENDING AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. IF DEMAND FOR PCS, SERVERS, AND OTHER COMPUTING DEVICES DECLINES, OR CONSUMER OR BUSINESS SPENDING FOR THOSE

PRODUCTS DECLINES, OUR REVENUE WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. OUR PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION

SYSTEM ALSO RELIES ON AN EXTENSIVE PARTNER NETWORK. THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON OUR PARTNERS, SUCH AS THE BANKRUPTCY OF A MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR, COULD RESULT IN SALES CHANNEL DISRUPTION.

CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ALSO MAY IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY HAVE PURCHASED. AS A RESULT, RESERVES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND WRITE-OFFS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MAY INCREASE. WE MAINTAIN AN

INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS HOLDINGS, TYPES, AND MATURITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO GENERAL CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, MARKET, AND INTEREST RATE RISKS, WHICH MAY BE EXACERBATED BY UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT HAVE AFFECTED GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. IF

GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS EXPERIENCE PROLONGED PERIODS OF DECLINE, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AND WE COULD DETERMINE THAT MORE OF OUR INVESTMENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE,

REQUIRING IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT COULD ADVERSELY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE HAVE CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AGAINST US THAT MAY

RESULT IN ADVERSE OUTCOMES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS. ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN SOME OR ALL OF THESE CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES RESOLVING ALL OF THESE MATTERS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE LITIGATION AND OTHER CLAIMS ARE

SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ALSO COULD OCCUR FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECT OF AN UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOME BECOMES

PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES

IN THE UNITED STATES AND MANY FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE

TAX DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN. WE REGULARLY ARE UNDER AUDIT BY TAX AUTHORITIES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF TAX AUDITS AND ANY RELATED LITIGATION COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR HISTORICAL

INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. THE RESULTS OF AN AUDIT OR LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE.

WE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING INCOME FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND ANY REPATRIATION OF FUNDS CURRENTLY HELD IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS

MAY RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS TO CHANGE U.S. TAX LAWS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT HOW U.S. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS ARE TAXED ON FOREIGN EARNINGS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT

PREDICT WHETHER OR IN WHAT FORM THIS PROPOSED LEGISLATION WILL PASS, IF ENACTED IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR TAX EXPENSE AND CASH FLOW.

OUR VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR SUPPLY PROBLEMS.

OUR HARDWARE

PRODUCTS SUCH AS THE XBOX 360 CONSOLE ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND CAN HAVE DEFECTS IN DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, OR ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE. WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, LOST REVENUE, AND REPUTATIONAL HARM IF WE FAIL TO DETECT OR EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS SUCH

ISSUES THROUGH DESIGN, TESTING, OR WARRANTY REPAIRS. WE OBTAIN SOME COMPONENTS OF OUR HARDWARE DEVICES FROM SOLE SUPPLIERS. IF A COMPONENT DELIVERY FROM A SOLE-SOURCE SUPPLIER IS DELAYED OR BECOMES UNAVAILABLE OR INDUSTRY SHORTAGES OCCUR, WE MAY BE

UNABLE TO OBTAIN TIMELY REPLACEMENT SUPPLIES, RESULTING IN REDUCED SALES. EITHER COMPONENT SHORTAGES OR EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE. XBOX 360 CONSOLES ARE ASSEMBLED IN ASIA; DISRUPTIONS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN MAY

RESULT IN CONSOLE SHORTAGES THAT WOULD AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING MARGINS. THESE SAME RISKS WOULD APPLY TO ANY OTHER VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE MAY OFFER.

IF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME IMPAIRED WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO

EARNINGS.

UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S. GAAP), WE REVIEW OUR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE

CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. FACTORS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES, INDICATING THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS MAY NOT BE

RECOVERABLE, INCLUDE A DECLINE IN STOCK PRICE AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION, REDUCED FUTURE CASH FLOW ESTIMATES, AND SLOWER GROWTH RATES IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DURING THE PERIOD IN

WHICH ANY IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS DETERMINED, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE OPERATE A GLOBAL BUSINESS THAT EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL RISKS.

WE OPERATE IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES AND A SIGNIFICANT

PART OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES. PRESSURE TO MAKE OUR PRICING STRUCTURE UNIFORM MIGHT REQUIRE THAT WE REDUCE THE SALES PRICE OF OUR SOFTWARE IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. OPERATIONS OUTSIDE

THE UNITED STATES MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TRADE PROTECTION LAWS, POLICIES AND MEASURES, AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT, INCLUDING THE FOREIGN CORRUPT

PRACTICES ACT AND LOCAL LAWS PROHIBITING CORRUPT PAYMENTS. EMERGING MARKETS ARE A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL GROWTH STRATEGY. THE DEVELOPING NATURE OF THESE MARKETS PRESENTS A NUMBER OF RISKS. DETERIORATION OF SOCIAL, POLITICAL, LABOR,

OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION AND DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING FOREIGN OPERATIONS MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. ALTHOUGH WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY EXPOSURE,

SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUES.

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR GEO-POLITICAL CONDITIONS MAY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS.

A DISRUPTION OR FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEMS OR

OPERATIONS IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE, WEATHER EVENT, CYBER-ATTACK, TERRORIST ATTACK, OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENT COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN COMPLETING SALES, PROVIDING SERVICES, OR PERFORMING OTHER MISSION-CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. OUR CORPORATE

HEADQUARTERS, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN THE SEATTLE, WASHINGTON AREA, AND WE HAVE OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF

CALIFORNIA, BOTH OF WHICH ARE NEAR MAJOR EARTHQUAKE FAULTS. A CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT RESULTS IN THE DESTRUCTION OR DISRUPTION OF ANY OF OUR CRITICAL BUSINESS OR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT NORMAL BUSINESS

OPERATIONS AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS. ABRUPT POLITICAL CHANGE, TERRORIST ACTIVITY, AND ARMED CONFLICT POSE A RISK OF GENERAL ECONOMIC DISRUPTION IN AFFECTED COUNTRIES, WHICH MAY INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. THESE CONDITIONS ALSO MAY ADD UNCERTAINTY

TO THE TIMING AND BUDGET FOR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT DECISIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS. THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IN GENERAL OR THE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR ARE UNCLEAR. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR

CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY, DEMAND OR AVAILABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING NATURAL RESOURCES, NECESSARY TO RUN OUR BUSINESS. CHANGES IN WEATHER WHERE WE OPERATE MAY INCREASE THE COSTS OF

POWERING AND COOLING COMPUTER HARDWARE WE USE TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE AND PROVIDE CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. NEW REGULATIONS MAY REQUIRE US TO FIND ALTERNATIVE COMPLIANT AND COST-EFFECTIVE METHODS OF DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE MAKING ACQUISITIONS

OR ENTERING INTO JOINT VENTURES AS PART OF OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS STRATEGY. THESE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS INCLUDING THAT THE TRANSACTION DOES NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, THAT WE DONT REALIZE A SATISFACTORY

RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT, OR THAT WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY IN THE INTEGRATION OF NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY, OR DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM OUR OTHER BUSINESSES. THESE EVENTS COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR

FINANCIAL CONDITION.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL

CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

OVERVIEW AND OUTLOOK

THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) IS INTENDED TO HELP THE READER UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION. MD&A IS PROVIDED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (NOTES). WE GENERATE

REVENUE BY DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING, LICENSING, AND SUPPORTING A WIDE RANGE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMPUTING DEVICES. OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE OPERATING SYSTEMS FOR PERSONAL COMPUTERS,

SERVERS, AND INTELLIGENT DEVICES; SERVER APPLICATIONS FOR DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS; INFORMATION WORKER PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS; BUSINESS SOLUTIONS APPLICATIONS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING APPLICATIONS; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS; AND

VIDEO GAMES. WE PROVIDE CONSULTING AND PRODUCT AND SOLUTION SUPPORT SERVICES, AND WE TRAIN AND CERTIFY COMPUTER SYSTEM INTEGRATORS AND DEVELOPERS. WE ALSO DESIGN AND SELL HARDWARE, INCLUDING THE XBOX 360 GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLE AND

ACCESSORIES, THE ZUNE DIGITAL MUSIC AND ENTERTAINMENT DEVICE AND ACCESSORIES, AND MICROSOFT PC HARDWARE PRODUCTS. ONLINE OFFERINGS AND INFORMATION ARE DELIVERED TO CONSUMERS THROUGH BING, WINDOWS LIVE, MICROSOFT OFFICE WEB APPS, OUR MSN PORTALS AND

CHANNELS, AND TO BUSINESSES THROUGH MICROSOFT ONLINE SERVICES OFFERINGS, SUCH AS MICROSOFT DYNAMICS CRM ONLINE, EXCHANGE ONLINE, WINDOWS AZURE, SQL AZURE AND SHAREPOINT ONLINE. WE ENABLE THE DELIVERY OF ONLINE ADVERTISING ACROSS OUR BROAD RANGE OF

DIGITAL MEDIA PROPERTIES AND ON BING THROUGH OUR PROPRIETARY ADCENTER PLATFORM.

OUR REVENUE HISTORICALLY HAS FLUCTUATED QUARTERLY AND

HAS GENERALLY BEEN THE HIGHEST IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR DUE TO CORPORATE CALENDAR YEAR-END SPENDING TRENDS IN OUR MAJOR MARKETS AND HOLIDAY SEASON SPENDING BY CONSUMERS. OUR ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION IS PARTICULARLY SEASONAL

AS ITS PRODUCTS ARE AIMED AT THE CONSUMER MARKET AND ARE IN HIGHEST DEMAND DURING THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON. TYPICALLY, THE ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION HAS GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 40% OF ITS ANNUAL SEGMENT REVENUES IN OUR SECOND FISCAL

QUARTER. IN ADDITION, QUARTERLY REVENUES MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE DEFERRAL OF REVENUE. SEE THE DISCUSSIONS BELOW REGARDING THE DEFERRAL OF REVENUE RELATED TO ELIGIBLE SALES OF THE 2007 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM WITH A GUARANTEE TO BE UPGRADED TO THE

2010 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AT MINIMAL OR NO COST (THE OFFICE 2010 DEFERRAL) AND SALES OF WINDOWS VISTA WITH A GUARANTEE TO BE UPGRADED TO WINDOWS 7 AT MINIMAL OR NO COST AND OF WINDOWS 7 TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS AND

RETAILERS BEFORE GENERAL AVAILABILITY (THE WINDOWS 7 DEFERRAL).

GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC FACTORS HAVE A STRONG CORRELATION TO

DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, HARDWARE, AND ONLINE OFFERINGS. THE UNFAVORABLE GLOBAL ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT ADVERSELY AFFECTED OUR BUSINESS IN FISCAL YEAR 2009 AS CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES CUT BACK ON SPENDING, WHICH REDUCED PC SHIPMENTS AND IT

INVESTMENTS. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2010, THE ENVIRONMENT BEGAN TO IMPROVE. HOWEVER, THE CURRENT MACROECONOMIC FACTORS REMAIN DYNAMIC AND UNCERTAIN AND ARE LIKELY TO REMAIN SO INTO 2011. IRRESPECTIVE OF GLOBAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, WE ARE POSITIVE

ABOUT OUR RELATIVE MARKET POSITION, OUR CURRENT PRODUCT PORTFOLIO AND FUTURE PRODUCT PIPELINE. BECAUSE WE OFFER A WIDE RANGE OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT ENABLE COMPANIES TO IMPROVE PRODUCTIVITY AND REDUCE COSTS, INCLUDING CLOUD-BASED

SERVICES, WE BELIEVE THAT MICROSOFT IS WELL-POSITIONED TO CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES TO INCREASE REVENUE AS THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IMPROVES. WE REMAIN FOCUSED ON EXECUTING IN THE AREAS WE CAN CONTROL BY CONTINUING TO PROVIDE HIGH VALUE PRODUCTS AT THE

LOWEST TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP WHILE MANAGING OUR EXPENSES.

TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION IS THE FOUNDATION OF OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH AND WE

INTEND TO MAINTAIN OUR COMMITMENT TO INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE, AND DELIVERING HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS. WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SOLUTIONS

THAT WE BELIEVE WILL ENHANCE INFORMATION WORKER PRODUCTIVITY, IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION IN WORK GROUPS, AID BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE, AND STREAMLINE PROCESSES FOR SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES. TO SUSTAIN GROWTH IN THE FACE OF

COMPETITION FROM OTHER VENDORS OF PROPRIETARY AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, OUR GOAL IS TO DELIVER PRODUCTS THAT PROVIDE THE BEST PLATFORM FOR NETWORK COMPUTING  SOFTWARE THAT IS EASIEST TO DEPLOY AND MANAGE, AND THAT IS MOST SECURE  WITH

THE LOWEST TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP.

IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN EXISTING AND NEW LINES OF

BUSINESS, INCLUDING CLOUD COMPUTING, SEARCH, ONLINE SOLUTIONS, BUSINESS SOLUTIONS, MOBILE COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION, ENTERTAINMENT, AND OTHER AREAS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH. WE ALSO INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF

ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES FOR FUTURE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THAT DELIVERING INNOVATIVE AND HIGH-VALUE SOLUTIONS THROUGH OUR INTEGRATED PLATFORM IS THE KEY TO MEETING CUSTOMER NEEDS AND TO OUR FUTURE GROWTH.

THIS LONG-TERM FOCUS ON INVESTMENT IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT HAS ENABLED US TO LAY A FOUNDATION FOR FUTURE GROWTH BY DELIVERING INNOVATIVE

PRODUCTS, CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERS, AND IMPROVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION. OUR FOCUS IN FISCAL YEAR 2011 IS TO BUILD ON THIS FOUNDATION AND TO CONTINUE TO EXECUTE WELL IN KEY AREAS THROUGH ONGOING INNOVATION ON OUR INTEGRATED SOFTWARE

PLATFORM, BY RESPONDING EFFECTIVELY TO CUSTOMER AND PARTNER NEEDS, AND BY FOCUSING INTERNALLY ON PRODUCT EXCELLENCE, BUSINESS EFFICACY, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS THE COMPANY.

FISCAL YEAR 2010 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2009

REVENUE INCREASED MAINLY DUE TO STRONG SALES OF WINDOWS 7, WHICH WAS RELEASED DURING FISCAL YEAR 2010, AND PC MARKET IMPROVEMENT. OPERATING INCOME

INCREASED REFLECTING THE CHANGE IN REVENUE, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES.



SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCREASED $335 MILLION OR 3%, PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASED ADVERTISING AND MARKETING OF WINDOWS 7 AND BING AND INCREASED SALES

FORCE EXPENSES RELATED TO WINDOWS 7.



GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES INCREASED $304 MILLION OR 8% DUE MAINLY TO INCREASED LEGAL CHARGES AND TRANSITION EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INCEPTION

OF THE YAHOO! COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT, OFFSET IN PART BY A REDUCTION IN HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES.



COST OF REVENUE INCREASED $240 MILLION OR 2%, PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASED ONLINE COSTS AND CHARGES RESULTING FROM THE DISCONTINUATION OF THE KIN PHONE,

OFFSET IN PART BY DECREASED XBOX 360 CONSOLE COSTS AND REDUCTIONS IN OTHER COSTS DUE TO RESOURCE MANAGEMENT EFFORTS.



RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES DECREASED $296 MILLION OR 3%, PRIMARILY REFLECTING A DECREASE IN THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING COSTS AND INCREASED

CAPITALIZATION OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS.

DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE INCREASED REFLECTING INCREASED NET

INCOME AND THE REPURCHASE OF 380 MILLION SHARES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2010.

FISCAL YEAR 2009 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2008

REVENUE DECLINED ACROSS MOST SEGMENTS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WEAKNESS IN THE GLOBAL PC MARKET AND THE UNFAVORABLE ECONOMIC ENVIRONMENT. PRIMARY

FACTORS CONTRIBUTING TO THE DECLINE INCLUDE THE FOLLOWING.



REVENUE FROM WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS DECLINED REFLECTING PC MARKET WEAKNESS, ESPECIALLY PCS SOLD TO BUSINESSES.



REVENUE FROM OUR ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION DECREASED ACROSS MOST LINES OF BUSINESS INCLUDING XBOX 360 PLATFORM AND PC GAME REVENUE WHICH DECLINED

PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF DECREASED REVENUE PER CONSOLE DUE TO PRICE REDUCTIONS DURING THE PRIOR 12 MONTHS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED CONSOLE SALES AND XBOX LIVE REVENUE.

ITEM 7

THE ABOVE DECLINES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED SERVER AND SERVER APPLICATION REVENUE,

REFLECTING RECOGNITION OF DEFERRED REVENUE FROM PREVIOUSLY SIGNED AGREEMENTS AND CONTINUED ADOPTION OF THE WINDOWS SERVER PLATFORM AND APPLICATIONS THROUGH SQL SERVER, ENTERPRISE CAL SUITES, AND SYSTEM CENTER PRODUCTS. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE

RATES HAD A FAVORABLE IMPACT OF $486 MILLION ON REVENUE.

OPERATING INCOME DECREASED PRIMARILY REFLECTING DECREASED REVENUE. OPERATING

EXPENSES WERE FLAT WITH DECREASED GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE AND SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES OFFSET BY INCREASED HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES, COST OF REVENUE, AND EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE CHARGES.



GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES DECREASED $1.4 BILLION OR 28%, PRIMARILY DUE TO DECREASED COSTS FOR LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES. WE INCURRED $283

MILLION OF LEGAL CHARGES DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2009 AS COMPARED TO $1.8 BILLION DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2008. THE PRIOR YEAR COSTS WERE PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FINE OF $1.4 BILLION

(



899 MILLION).



SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES DECREASED $381 MILLION OR 3%, PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY THE RESOURCE MANAGEMENT PROGRAM. AS PART OF THAT PROGRAM, WE REDUCED MARKETING

AND ADVERTISING EXPENSES.



HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES, EXCLUDING $330 MILLION OF EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE CHARGES, INCREASED 7%, DRIVEN BY A 2% INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DURING THE PAST 12 MONTHS

AND AN INCREASE IN SALARIES AND BENEFITS FOR EXISTING HEADCOUNT.



COST OF REVENUE INCREASED $557 MILLION OR 5%, PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASED ONLINE COSTS, INCLUDING ONLINE TRAFFIC ACQUISITION, DATA CENTER AND EQUIPMENT,

AND HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED XBOX 360 PLATFORM COSTS.

WE

USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND CREDIT; TO ENHANCE INVESTMENT RETURNS; AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF

DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE). THESE ARE GENERALLY OFFSET BY UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES IN THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES IN THE INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO AND ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

FISCAL YEAR 2010 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2009

DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER AVERAGE PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT BALANCES, OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER YIELDS ON OUR

FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS. INTEREST EXPENSE INCREASED DUE TO OUR ISSUANCE OF LONG TERM DEBT IN MAY 2009. NET RECOGNIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOWER OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, OFFSET IN PART BY LOWER GAINS ON SALES OF

INVESTMENTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS WERE $69 MILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2010, AS COMPARED WITH $862 MILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2009 AND DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO IMPROVEMENTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS. NET LOSSES ON

DERIVATIVES DECREASED DUE TO GAINS ON EQUITY AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES AS COMPARED TO LOSSES IN THE PRIOR PERIOD AND LOWER LOSSES ON COMMODITY AND FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS IN THE CURRENT PERIOD. NET GAINS FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY REMEASUREMENTS

WERE INSIGNIFICANT IN FISCAL YEAR 2010 COMPARED TO NET LOSSES OF $509 MILLION IN THE PRIOR YEAR, WHICH HAD RESULTED FROM THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR IN THE PRIOR YEAR. FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010, OTHER INCLUDES A GAIN ON THE DIVESTITURE OF

RAZORFISH.

ITEM 7

FISCAL YEAR 2009 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2008

DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST INCOME DECREASED PRIMARILY REFLECTING LOWER INTEREST RATES ON OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS. INTEREST EXPENSE DECREASED DUE

TO LOWER AVERAGE COLLATERAL BALANCES ON LOANED SECURITIES AND RELATED RATES. NET RECOGNIZED LOSSES ON INVESTMENTS INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS THAT WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY GAINS ON SALES OF CERTAIN EQUITY

INVESTMENTS HELD IN OUR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO. OTHER-THAN- TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS WERE $862 MILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2009, AS COMPARED WITH $312 MILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2008 AND INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO DECLINES IN EQUITY VALUES AS A

RESULT OF DETERIORATION IN EQUITY MARKETS. NET LOSSES ON DERIVATIVES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO LOSSES ON EQUITY, COMMODITY, AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES IN FISCAL YEAR 2009 AS COMPARED WITH GAINS IN THE PRIOR PERIOD. NET LOSSES ON FOREIGN CURRENCY

REMEASUREMENTS INCREASED DUE TO THE STRENGTHENING OF THE U.S. DOLLAR, PARTICULARLY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE FISCAL YEAR 2009.

INCOME TAXES

FISCAL YEAR 2010 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2009

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES IN FISCAL YEARS 2010 AND 2009 WERE 25% AND 27%, RESPECTIVELY. THE FISCAL YEAR 2010 RATE REFLECTS A HIGHER MIX OF FOREIGN

EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES.

FISCAL YEAR 2009 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2008

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES IN FISCAL YEARS 2009 AND 2008 WERE 27% AND 26%, RESPECTIVELY. WHILE THE FISCAL YEAR 2009 RATE REFLECTS A HIGHER MIX OF

FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES, THE RATE INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR BECAUSE THE FISCAL YEAR 2008 RATE REFLECTS THE RESOLUTION OF TAX POSITIONS RELATING TO OUR AGREEMENT WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE (IRS) SETTLING THE

2000-2003 EXAMINATION, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FINE WHICH WAS NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE. AS A RESULT OF THE SETTLEMENT AND THE IMPACT ON SUBSEQUENT YEARS, WE PAID THE IRS APPROXIMATELY $4.1 BILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2009.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

CASH,

CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALED $36.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, COMPARED WITH $31.4 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2009. EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE $7.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, COMPARED WITH $4.9 BILLION AS

OF JUNE 30, 2009. OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY TO FACILITATE LIQUIDITY AND FOR CAPITAL PRESERVATION. THEY CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF INVESTMENT GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. THE

INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SECURITIES IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY RISK.

IN GENERAL, AND WHERE APPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE. THIS

PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS EXCHANGE-TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND U.S. TREASURIES. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO

DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, THEN WE USE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR INPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS SUCH AS

CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AND AGENCY SECURITIES. LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS WITH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING

UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN IMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.

A MAJORITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRICED BY PRICING VENDORS AND ARE

GENERALLY LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS AS THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A QUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THEIR PRICING WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. BROKER PRICING IS USED MAINLY WHEN A QUOTED

PRICE IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE INVESTMENT IS NOT PRICED BY OUR PRICING VENDORS, OR WHEN A BROKER PRICE IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF FAIR VALUES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT TRADES. OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY LABELED AS LEVEL 2

INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THE BROKER PRICES THESE INVESTMENTS BASED ON SIMILAR ASSETS WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION, ALL

33

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

OF OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS HAVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF TRADING VOLUME TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FAIR VALUES USED ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. OUR FAIR VALUE PROCESSES INCLUDE

CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED. THESE CONTROLS INCLUDE MODEL VALIDATION, REVIEW OF KEY MODEL INPUTS, ANALYSIS OF PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS, AND INDEPENDENT RECALCULATION OF PRICES WHERE

APPROPRIATE.

WHILE WE OWN CERTAIN MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, OUR PORTFOLIO AS OF JUNE 30, 2010 DOES

NOT CONTAIN DIRECT EXPOSURE TO SUBPRIME MORTGAGES OR STRUCTURED VEHICLES THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM SUBPRIME COLLATERAL. THE MAJORITY OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY PRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND CARRY A 100% PRINCIPAL

AND INTEREST GUARANTEE, PRIMARILY FROM FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION, AND GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION.

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON

OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET

WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY.

DEBT

IN SEPTEMBER 2008, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED DEBT FINANCINGS OF UP TO $6.0 BILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, WE HAD $6.0 BILLION OF ISSUED

AND OUTSTANDING DEBT COMPRISED OF $1.0 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND $5.0 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT INCLUDING $1.25 BILLION OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT.

SHORT-TERM DEBT

AS OF JUNE 30, 2010,

OUR $1.0 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING HAD A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE, INCLUDING ISSUANCE COSTS, OF 0.20% AND MATURITIES OF 22 TO 216 DAYS. IN NOVEMBER 2009, WE REPLACED OUR $2.0 BILLION AND $1.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITIES

WITH A $2.25 BILLION 364-DAY CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH EXPIRES ON NOVEMBER 5, 2010. THIS FACILITY SERVES AS A BACK-UP FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. IN JUNE 2010, WE REDUCED THE SIZE OF OUR CREDIT FACILITY FROM $2.25 BILLION TO $1.0 BILLION DUE

TO THE REDUCTION IN COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANT IN THE CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, WHICH REQUIRES A COVERAGE RATIO BE MAINTAINED OF AT LEAST THREE TIMES EARNINGS BEFORE

INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION TO INTEREST EXPENSE. NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN AGAINST THE CREDIT FACILITY DURING ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

LONG-TERM DEBT

NOTES

AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, WE HAD ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING $3.75 BILLION OF DEBT SECURITIES AS FOLLOWS: $2.0 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF

2.95% NOTES DUE 2014, $1.0 BILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 4.20% NOTES DUE 2019, AND $750 MILLION AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF 5.20% NOTES DUE 2039 (COLLECTIVELY THE NOTES). INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY ON

JUNE 1 AND DECEMBER 1 OF EACH YEAR TO HOLDERS OF RECORD ON THE PRECEDING MAY 15 AND NOVEMBER 15. THE NOTES ARE SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS AND RANK EQUALLY WITH OUR OTHER UNSECURED AND UNSUBORDINATED DEBT OUTSTANDING.

CONVERTIBLE DEBT

IN JUNE 2010,

WE ISSUED $1.25 BILLION OF ZERO COUPON CONVERTIBLE UNSECURED DEBT DUE ON JUNE 15, 2013 IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERING. PROCEEDS FROM THE OFFERING WERE $1.24 BILLION, NET OF FEES AND EXPENSES WHICH WERE CAPITALIZED. THE MAJORITY OF THE PROCEEDS

WERE USED TO REPAY OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER, LEAVING $1.0 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING AS OF JUNE 30, 2010. EACH $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NOTES IS CONVERTIBLE INTO 29.94 SHARES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE OF

$33.40 PER SHARE.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2013, THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE, ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INTO

CASH AND, IF APPLICABLE, CASH, SHARES OF MICROSOFTS COMMON STOCK OR A COMBINATION THEREOF, AT OUR ELECTION. ON OR AFTER MARCH 15, 2013, THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE AT ANY TIME. UPON CONVERSION, WE WILL PAY CASH UP TO THE AGGREGATE

PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES AND PAY OR DELIVER CASH, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AT OUR ELECTION.

BECAUSE THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT MAY BE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY SETTLED IN CASH, WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEPARATELY ACCOUNT FOR THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY

COMPONENTS OF THE NOTES IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS OUR NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT BORROWING RATE WHEN INTEREST COSTS ARE RECOGNIZED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. THE NET PROCEEDS OF $1.24 BILLION WERE ALLOCATED BETWEEN DEBT FOR $1.18 BILLION AND STOCKHOLDERS

EQUITY FOR $58 MILLION, WITH THE PORTION IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY REPRESENTING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTION TO CONVERT THE DEBT.

IN

CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES, WE ENTERED INTO CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS WITH CERTAIN OPTION COUNTERPARTIES WHO ARE INITIAL PURCHASERS OF THE NOTES OR THEIR AFFILIATES. THE CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE POTENTIAL

DILUTION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE UPON CONVERSION OF THE NOTES. UNDER THE CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS, WE PURCHASED FROM THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES CAPPED CALL OPTIONS THAT IN THE AGGREGATE RELATE TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK

UNDERLYING THE NOTES, WITH A STRIKE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CONVERSION PRICE OF THE NOTES AND WITH A CAP PRICE INITIALLY EQUAL TO $37.16. THE PURCHASED CAPPED CALLS WERE VALUED AT $40 MILLION AND WERE CHARGED TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

UNEARNED REVENUE

UNEARNED REVENUE AT

JUNE 30, 2010 COMPRISED MAINLY UNEARNED REVENUE FROM VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS. UNEARNED REVENUE FROM VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS REPRESENTS CUSTOMER BILLINGS FOR MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS PAID FOR EITHER AT INCEPTION OF THE AGREEMENT OR

ANNUALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS WITH REVENUE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD. UNEARNED REVENUE AT JUNE 30, 2010 ALSO INCLUDED PAYMENTS FOR: POST-DELIVERY SUPPORT

AND CONSULTING SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED IN THE FUTURE, XBOX LIVE SUBSCRIPTIONS; UNSPECIFIED UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS OF MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS FOR WINDOWS XP; MICROSOFT DYNAMICS BUSINESS SOLUTIONS PRODUCTS;

TECHNOLOGY GUARANTEE PROGRAMS, INCLUDING THE 2010 MICROSOFT OFFICE TECHNOLOGY GUARANTEE PROGRAM; AND OTHER OFFERINGS FOR WHICH WE HAVE BEEN PAID IN ADVANCE AND EARN THE REVENUE WHEN WE PROVIDE THE SERVICE OR SOFTWARE, OR OTHERWISE MEET THE REVENUE

RESULT OF OUR SETTLEMENT OF THE 2000-2003 AUDIT EXAMINATION ALONG WITH INCREASED CASH RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS IN THE CURRENT YEAR. CASH USED FOR FINANCING INCREASED $5.8 BILLION, PRIMARILY DUE TO A $5.6 BILLION DECREASE IN NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM

ISSUANCE AND REPAYMENTS OF SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT. FINANCING ACTIVITIES ALSO INCLUDED A $1.9 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, WHICH WAS OFFSET IN PART

BY A $1.7 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH RECEIVED FROM COMMON STOCK ISSUED. CASH USED FOR INVESTING DECREASED $4.5 BILLION DUE TO A $3.3 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR COMBINED INVESTMENT PURCHASES,

SALES, AND MATURITIES ALONG WITH A $1.1 BILLION DECREASE IN ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.

FISCAL YEAR 2009 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2008

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS DECREASED $2.6 BILLION DUE TO PAYMENT OF APPROXIMATELY $4.1 BILLION TO THE IRS IN CONNECTION WITH OUR

SETTLEMENT OF THE 2000-2003 AUDIT EXAMINATION. THIS IMPACT WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE FISCAL YEAR 2008 PAYMENT OF THE $1.4 BILLION (



MILLION) EUROPEAN COMMISSION FINE. CASH USED FOR FINANCING DECREASED $5.5 BILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO $5.7 BILLION OF NET CASH PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCE OF SHORT-TERM AND LONG-TERM DEBT IN FISCAL YEAR 2009. FINANCING ACTIVITIES ALSO INCLUDED A $3.2

BILLION DECREASE IN COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED, WHICH WAS OFFSET BY A $2.9 BILLION DECLINE IN COMMON STOCK ISSUED. CASH USED FOR INVESTING INCREASED $11.2 BILLION DUE TO A $15.9 BILLION RISE IN PURCHASES OF INVESTMENTS ALONG WITH A $1.7 BILLION

DECREASE IN CASH FROM INVESTMENT SALES AND MATURITIES. THESE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $7.2 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITION OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING THE PURCHASE OF AQUANTIVE IN FISCAL YEAR 2008.

SHARE REPURCHASES

ON SEPTEMBER 22,

2008, WE ANNOUNCED THE COMPLETION OF THE TWO REPURCHASE PROGRAMS APPROVED BY OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2007 (THE 2007 PROGRAMS) TO BUY BACK UP TO $40.0 BILLION OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK. ON

SEPTEMBER 22, 2008, WE ALSO ANNOUNCED THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS APPROVED A NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM AUTHORIZING UP TO $40.0 BILLION IN SHARE REPURCHASES WITH AN EXPIRATION DATE OF SEPTEMBER 30, 2013 (THE 2008 PROGRAM). AS

OF JUNE 30, 2010, APPROXIMATELY $23.7 BILLION REMAINED OF THE $40.0 BILLION APPROVED REPURCHASE AMOUNT. THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM MAY BE SUSPENDED OR DISCONTINUED AT ANY TIME WITHOUT NOTICE.

DURING THE PERIODS REPORTED, WE REPURCHASED WITH CASH RESOURCES: 380 MILLION SHARES FOR $10.8 BILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2010;

318 MILLION SHARES FOR $8.2 BILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2009; AND 402 MILLION SHARES FOR $12.4 BILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2008. ALL SHARES REPURCHASED IN FISCAL YEAR 2010 WERE REPURCHASED UNDER THE 2008 PROGRAM, WHILE ALL SHARES REPURCHASED

IN FISCAL YEAR 2008 WERE REPURCHASED UNDER THE 2007 PROGRAMS. OF THE SHARES REPURCHASED IN FISCAL YEAR 2009, 101 MILLION SHARES WERE REPURCHASED FOR $2.7 BILLION UNDER THE 2007 PROGRAMS, WHILE THE REMAINDER WERE REPURCHASED UNDER THE 2008

PROGRAM.

$1.2 BILLION AND NON-CASH ITEMS OF $240 MILLION.

OTHER PLANNED USES OF CAPITAL

WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES, MARKETING, PRODUCT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EXISTING AND ADVANCED AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY. ADDITIONS TO

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WILL CONTINUE, INCLUDING NEW FACILITIES, DATA CENTERS, AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, SUPPORT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. WE HAVE OPERATING LEASES FOR MOST U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES

AND SUPPORT OFFICES AND CERTAIN EQUIPMENT. WE HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT LIQUIDITY OR THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL

RESOURCES.

WE BELIEVE EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, TOGETHER WITH FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, SHOULD

BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OPERATING REQUIREMENTS, REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, DEBT REPAYMENT SCHEDULES, AND SHARE REPURCHASES. OUR PHILOSOPHY REGARDING THE MAINTENANCE OF A BALANCE SHEET WITH A LARGE COMPONENT OF CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS, AND EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS, REFLECTS OUR VIEWS ON POTENTIAL FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS RELATING TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CREATION AND EXPANSION OF SALES DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS, SHARE DILUTION

MANAGEMENT, LEGAL RISKS, AND CHALLENGES TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL. WE REGULARLY ASSESS OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT APPROACH IN VIEW OF OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL FUTURE NEEDS.

AS A RESULT OF THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2005 AND SHARES

REPURCHASED, OUR RETAINED DEFICIT, INCLUDING ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WAS $16.7 BILLION AT JUNE 30, 2010. OUR RETAINED DEFICIT IS NOT EXPECTED TO AFFECT OUR FUTURE ABILITY TO OPERATE, PAY DIVIDENDS, OR REPAY OUR DEBT GIVEN OUR

CONTINUING PROFITABILITY AND STRONG CASH AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

RECENT LEGISLATION

IN MARCH 2010, THE PATIENT PROTECTION AND AFFORDABLE CARE ACT AND THE HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION RECONCILIATION ACT OF 2010 WERE SIGNED INTO LAW IN

THE UNITED STATES. THIS LEGISLATION EXPANDS HEALTH CARE COVERAGE TO MANY UNINSURED INDIVIDUALS AND EXPANDS COVERAGE TO THOSE ALREADY INSURED. THE CHANGES REQUIRED BY THIS LEGISLATION WILL LARGELY BE FUNDED THROUGH TAX INCREASES TO BOTH INSURERS AND

THE INSURED. WE DO NOT EXPECT ANY NEAR TERM IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS AS A RESULT OF THE LEGISLATION. ONE PROVISION THAT WILL IMPACT CERTAIN COMPANIES SIGNIFICANTLY IS THE ELIMINATION OF THE TAX DEDUCTIBILITY OF THE MEDICARE PART D SUBSIDY.

THIS PROVISION DOES NOT AFFECT US BECAUSE WE DO NOT PROVIDE RETIREE HEALTH BENEFITS.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE TO AMEND THE DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO

RECURRING AND NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES NEW DISCLOSURES ON THE TRANSFERS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BETWEEN LEVEL 1 (QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKET FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES) AND LEVEL 2 (SIGNIFICANT

OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS) OF THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT HIERARCHY, INCLUDING THE REASONS AND THE TIMING OF THE TRANSFERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES A ROLL FORWARD OF ACTIVITIES ON PURCHASES, SALES, ISSUANCE, AND SETTLEMENTS OF THE

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS). THE GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR US WITH THE REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010, EXCEPT FOR THE DISCLOSURE ON THE ROLL FORWARD

ACTIVITIES FOR LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, WHICH WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR US WITH THE REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING JULY 1, 2011. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT

ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ON JULY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FASB ON BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. THE GUIDANCE

RETAINS THE FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENTS THAT THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING) BE USED FOR ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS, BUT REQUIRES A NUMBER OF CHANGES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE WAY ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED AS A RESULT OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE CAPITALIZATION OF IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AT FAIR VALUE AND REQUIRES THE EXPENSING OF ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS AS INCURRED. WE HAVE

APPLIED THIS GUIDANCE TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS COMPLETED SINCE JULY 1, 2009.

ON JULY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED GUIDANCE ISSUED BY

THE FASB THAT CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS. NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS ARE TO BE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF EQUITY SEPARATE FROM THE PARENTS EQUITY, AND PURCHASES OR SALES OF EQUITY INTERESTS THAT DO NOT

RESULT IN A CHANGE IN CONTROL ARE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS EQUITY TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO A NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IS TO BE INCLUDED IN NET INCOME AND, UPON A LOSS OF CONTROL, THE INTEREST SOLD, AS WELL AS ANY INTEREST

RETAINED, IS TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH ANY GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNIZED IN NET INCOME. ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ON JULY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED GUIDANCE ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT FOR NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, EXCEPT FOR ITEMS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED

OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY). ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON REVENUE RECOGNITION THAT WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2010. UNDER THE NEW

GUIDANCE ON ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, TANGIBLE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE TANGIBLE PRODUCT WILL NO LONGER BE WITHIN THE SCOPE

38

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

OF THE SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE, AND SOFTWARE-ENABLED PRODUCTS WILL NOW BE SUBJECT TO OTHER RELEVANT REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON REVENUE

ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, WHEN VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OR THIRD PARTY EVIDENCE FOR DELIVERABLES IN AN ARRANGEMENT CANNOT BE

DETERMINED, A BEST ESTIMATE OF THE SELLING PRICE IS REQUIRED TO SEPARATE DELIVERABLES AND ALLOCATE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD. THE NEW GUIDANCE INCLUDES NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON HOW THE APPLICATION OF THE

RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD AFFECTS THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. WE BELIEVE ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON THE CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2010.

THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES REVISED EVALUATIONS OF WHETHER ENTITIES REPRESENT VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, ONGOING ASSESSMENTS OF CONTROL OVER SUCH ENTITIES, AND ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR VARIABLE INTERESTS. WE BELIEVE ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE

WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES

(U.S. GAAP). PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY

MANAGEMENTS APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR US INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, CONTINGENCIES, INCOME TAXES, STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION, AND PRODUCT WARRANTIES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING WHETHER A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT INCLUDES MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, AND IF SO, WHETHER

VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE) OF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR THOSE ELEMENTS. A PORTION OF REVENUE MAY BE RECORDED AS UNEARNED DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE ALLOCATED TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS BASED ON THE VSOE

OF FAIR VALUE FOR THOSE ELEMENTS USING THE RESIDUAL METHOD OR RELATIVE FAIR VALUE METHOD, AND THE DEFERRED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS THE ELEMENTS ARE DELIVERED. CHANGES TO THE ELEMENTS IN A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY VSOE FOR THOSE

ELEMENTS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS, AND CHANGES TO A PRODUCTS ESTIMATED LIFE CYCLE COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF EARNED AND UNEARNED REVENUE. JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER FUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN

SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS.

A PORTION OF THE REVENUE RELATED TO WINDOWS XP IS

RECORDED AS UNEARNED DUE TO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS OF MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS. REVENUE RELATED TO WINDOWS VISTA AND WINDOWS 7 IS NOT SUBJECT TO A SIMILAR DEFERRAL BECAUSE THERE ARE

NO SIGNIFICANT UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS. 2007 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM REVENUE IS SUBJECT TO DEFERRAL AS A RESULT OF THE 2010 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY GUARANTEE PROGRAM, WHICH STARTED MARCH 5, 2010. THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS WHO

PURCHASED CERTAIN VERSIONS OF THE 2007 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM TO RECEIVE AN UPGRADE TO THE CORRESPONDING VERSION OF THE 2010 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AT MINIMAL OR NO COST WHEN THE PRODUCT BECOMES GENERALLY AVAILABLE. ACCORDINGLY, ESTIMATED REVENUE

RELATED TO THE UNDELIVERED 2010 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM IS DEFERRED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS DELIVERED.

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES

INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT

JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY QUARTERLY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR

VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO

SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY.

ITEM 7

WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND

OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IF MARKET,

INDUSTRY, AND/OR INVESTEE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1

FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE

BUSINESS CLIMATE, LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, COMPETITION, OR SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT. APPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF

REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED

CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS, ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, ESTIMATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OVER

WHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT. WE ALLOCATE

GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH.

IN ADDITION TO THE IMPAIRMENT TEST PERFORMED ON MAY 1, 2010, WE PERFORMED AN INTERIM IMPAIRMENT ANALYSIS OF OUR ONLINE SERVICES

DIVISION GOODWILL BALANCE DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2010 IN CONNECTION WITH THE DISPOSAL OF RAZORFISH. NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL WAS IDENTIFIED.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

COSTS

INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED, ALL SOFTWARE COSTS ARE

CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS

IS REACHED AFTER ALL HIGH-RISK DEVELOPMENT ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED THROUGH CODING AND TESTING. GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE COSTS IS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE OVER

THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE PRODUCTS.

LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

THE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY

SUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM IS ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DISCLOSURE OF A CONTINGENCY IS REQUIRED

IF THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS SHOULD BE ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE

ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME TAXES

THE OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND DEFERRED TAX

LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX

ITEM 7

POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS

RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION SHOULD BE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ACCOUNTING LITERATURE ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON

DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN

ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

STOCK-BASED

COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS AT THE GRANT DATE REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING

ESTIMATING EXPECTED DIVIDENDS. IN ADDITION, JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF STOCK-BASED AWARDS THAT ARE EXPECTED TO BE FORFEITED. IF ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND

OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE IMPACTED.

PRODUCT WARRANTIES

WE PROVIDE FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FOR HARDWARE WARRANTY, WE

ESTIMATE THE COSTS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED PRODUCT FAILURE RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED REPAIR COSTS, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES (IF ANY). THE SPECIFIC HARDWARE WARRANTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS VARY DEPENDING UPON THE

PRODUCT SOLD AND COUNTRY IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, BUT GENERALLY INCLUDE PARTS AND LABOR OVER A PERIOD GENERALLY RANGING FROM 90 DAYS TO THREE YEARS. FOR SOFTWARE WARRANTY, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS TO PROVIDE BUG FIXES, SUCH AS SECURITY PATCHES,

OVER THE LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE. WE REGULARLY REEVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF THE RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUST THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY.

RISK

RISKS

WE ARE EXPOSED TO ECONOMIC RISK FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT RISK, EQUITY PRICES, AND COMMODITY PRICES. A PORTION

OF THESE RISKS IS HEDGED, BUT THEY MAY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY.

CERTAIN

FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY AND USE HEDGES WHERE PRACTICABLE TO OFFSET THE RISKS AND MAXIMIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN

CURRENCY POSITIONS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR.

INTEREST

RATE.

OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS CREDIT SECTORS AND MATURITIES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF THE FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED TO

ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC FIXED-INCOME INDICES. IN ADDITION, WE USE TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO AGENCY AND MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES.

EQUITY.

OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF GLOBAL, DEVELOPED, AND EMERGING MARKET SECURITIES

THAT ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. WE MANAGE THE SECURITIES RELATIVE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC INDICES AND EXPECT THEIR ECONOMIC RISK AND RETURN TO CORRELATE WITH THESE INDICES.

COMMODITY.

WE USE BROAD-BASED COMMODITY EXPOSURES TO ENHANCE PORTFOLIO RETURNS AND FACILITATE PORTFOLIO

DIVERSIFICATION. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS EXPOSURE TO A VARIETY OF COMMODITIES, INCLUDING PRECIOUS METALS, ENERGY, AND GRAIN. WE MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO GLOBAL COMMODITY INDICES AND EXPECT THEIR ECONOMIC RISK AND RETURN TO CORRELATE

WITH THESE INDICES.

VALUE-AT-RISK

WE USE A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE AND QUANTIFY OUR MARKET RISKS. VAR IS THE EXPECTED LOSS, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE LEVEL,

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING DETERMINATIONS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S. GAAP), BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF ALL HOLDINGS IS COMPUTED

BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS AMONG FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, AND COMMODITY PRICES, ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE VAR IS CALCULATED AS THE TOTAL LOSS THAT WILL NOT BE EXCEEDED AT THE 97.5 PERCENTILE CONFIDENCE LEVEL OR, ALTERNATIVELY STATED, THE LOSSES

COULD EXCEED THE VAR IN 25 OUT OF 1,000 CASES. SEVERAL RISK FACTORS ARE NOT CAPTURED IN THE MODEL, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, AND LEGAL RISK.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE SETS FORTH THE ONE-DAY VAR FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR POSITIONS AS OF JUNE 30, 2010 AND 2009 AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED

JUNE 30, 2010.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. EQUITY INVESTMENTS THROUGH WHICH WE EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER BUT DO NOT CONTROL THE INVESTEE AND

ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE INVESTEES ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD. INVESTMENTS THROUGH WHICH WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE INVESTEE AND WHICH DO NOT HAVE READILY DETERMINABLE

FAIR VALUES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE COST METHOD.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES,

REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. EXAMPLES INCLUDE: ESTIMATES OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES, PRODUCT WARRANTIES, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, PRODUCT RETURNS, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FORFEITURE RATES; ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS THE ELEMENTS COMPRISING A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT,

INCLUDING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW PRODUCTS; WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ACHIEVED FOR OUR PRODUCTS; THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

OR TAX RETURNS; ESTIMATING THE FAIR VALUE AND/OR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR OUR REPORTING UNITS; AND DETERMINING WHEN INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ACTUAL RESULTS AND OUTCOMES MAY DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT THE EXCHANGE RATE ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE

TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM THIS PROCESS ARE RECORDED TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI).

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED

WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE FEE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTIBILITY IS PROBABLE.

REVENUE FOR RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCTS, PRODUCTS LICENSED TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS), AND PERPETUAL LICENSES UNDER

CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE. A PORTION OF THE REVENUE RELATED TO WINDOWS XP IS DEFERRED DUE TO THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS OF MICROSOFT INTERNET

EXPLORER ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE UNSPECIFIED UPGRADE/ENHANCEMENT RIGHTS FOR MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER IS BASED ON THE VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE FOR THOSE ELEMENTS USING THE

RESIDUAL METHOD OR RELATIVE FAIR VALUE METHOD AND THE DEFERRED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE WINDOWS XP LIFE CYCLE. REVENUE RELATED TO WINDOWS VISTA AND WINDOWS 7 IS NOT SUBJECT TO A SIMILAR DEFERRAL BECAUSE THERE

ARE NO SIGNIFICANT UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS. REVENUE FOR PRODUCTS UNDER THE TECHNOLOGY GUARANTEE PROGRAMS, WHICH PROVIDE FREE OR SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED RIGHTS TO USE UPCOMING NEW VERSIONS OF A SOFTWARE PRODUCT IF AN END USER LICENSES EXISTING VERSIONS

OF THE PRODUCT DURING THE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD, IS ALLOCATED BETWEEN EXISTING PRODUCT AND THE NEW PRODUCT, AND REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE NEW PRODUCT IS DEFERRED UNTIL THAT VERSION IS DELIVERED. THE REVENUE ALLOCATION IS BASED ON VENDOR-SPECIFIC

OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE OF BOTH PRODUCTS.

CERTAIN MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS

COMBINED WITH RIGHTS TO RECEIVE FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS (SOFTWARE ASSURANCE) AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE

RATABLY OVER THE BILLING COVERAGE PERIOD. REVENUE FROM CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS THAT ALLOW FOR THE USE OF A PRODUCT OR SERVICE OVER A PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT TAKING POSSESSION OF SOFTWARE ARE ALSO ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS.

REVENUE RELATED TO OUR XBOX 360 GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLE, GAMES PUBLISHED BY US, AND OTHER HARDWARE COMPONENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN

OWNERSHIP IS TRANSFERRED TO THE RETAILERS. REVENUE RELATED TO GAMES PUBLISHED BY THIRD PARTIES FOR USE ON THE XBOX 360 PLATFORM IS RECOGNIZED WHEN GAMES ARE MANUFACTURED BY THE GAME PUBLISHERS. DISPLAY ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS

ADVERTISEMENTS ARE DISPLAYED. SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE AD APPEARS IN THE SEARCH RESULTS OR WHEN THE ACTION NECESSARY TO EARN THE REVENUE HAS BEEN COMPLETED. CONSULTING SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED,

GENERALLY BASED ON THE NEGOTIATED HOURLY RATE IN THE CONSULTING ARRANGEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED DURING THE PERIOD. CONSULTING REVENUE FOR FIXED-PRICE SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED.

REVENUE GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED NET OF ANY TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.

COST OF REVENUE

COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES;

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS FOR PRODUCTS SOLD AND PROGRAMS LICENSED; OPERATING COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICE CENTERS AND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS; COSTS INCURRED TO INCLUDE SOFTWARE ON PCS SOLD BY OEMS, TO DRIVE TRAFFIC TO

OUR WEB SITES AND TO ACQUIRE ONLINE ADVERTISING SPACE (TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS); COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN INTERNET-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; WARRANTY COSTS; INVENTORY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS; COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE

DELIVERY OF CONSULTING SERVICES; AND THE AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS. CAPITALIZED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PRODUCTS.

PRODUCT WARRANTY

WE PROVIDE FOR THE

ESTIMATED COSTS OF FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FOR HARDWARE WARRANTIES, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED PRODUCT FAILURE RATES, HISTORICAL

AND PROJECTED REPAIR COSTS, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES (IF ANY). THE SPECIFIC HARDWARE WARRANTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS VARY DEPENDING UPON THE PRODUCT SOLD AND THE COUNTRY IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, BUT GENERALLY INCLUDE PARTS AND LABOR

OVER A PERIOD GENERALLY RANGING FROM 90 DAYS TO THREE YEARS. FOR SOFTWARE WARRANTIES, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS TO PROVIDE BUG FIXES, SUCH AS SECURITY PATCHES, OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE. WE REGULARLY REEVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES TO ASSESS

THE ADEQUACY OF THE RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUST THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES

ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING COSTS, LOCALIZATION COSTS INCURRED TO TRANSLATE SOFTWARE FOR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND THE AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED

SOFTWARE CODE AND SERVICES CONTENT. SUCH COSTS RELATED TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ARE INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE UNTIL THE POINT THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS REACHED, WHICH FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, IS GENERALLY SHORTLY BEFORE

THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS REACHED, SUCH COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND AMORTIZED TO COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PRODUCTS.

SALES AND MARKETING

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH

SALES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL, AND THE COSTS OF ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS, TRADE SHOWS, SEMINARS, AND OTHER PROGRAMS. ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.6 BILLION, $1.4 BILLION, AND $1.2 BILLION IN FISCAL YEARS

2010, 2009, AND 2008, RESPECTIVELY.

EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE

WE RECORD EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE WHEN A SPECIFIC PLAN HAS BEEN APPROVED BY MANAGEMENT, THE PLAN HAS BEEN COMMUNICATED TO EMPLOYEES, AND IT IS UNLIKELY

THAT SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO THE PLAN.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

WE MEASURE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND RECOGNIZE IT AS EXPENSE OVER THE APPLICABLE

VESTING PERIOD OF THE STOCK AWARD (GENERALLY FOUR TO FIVE YEARS) USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE PURCHASED BY EMPLOYEES AT THREE-MONTH INTERVALS AT 90% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE STOCK ON THE LAST DAY OF

EACH THREE-MONTH PERIOD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN IS MEASURED AS THE DISCOUNT THE EMPLOYEE IS ENTITLED TO UPON PURCHASE AND IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD OF PURCHASE.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL INCOME TAXES, THE PROVISION FOR U.S. TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES NOT DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY INVESTED AND INTEREST AND PENALTIES ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. CERTAIN INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE

NOT REPORTED IN TAX RETURNS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE SAME YEAR. THE TAX EFFECT OF SUCH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IS REPORTED AS DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

WE ACCOUNT FOR

CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE HIERARCHY BELOW LISTS THREE LEVELS OF FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET. WE CATEGORIZE EACH OF OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

IN ONE OF THESE THREE LEVELS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THESE LEVELS ARE.



LEVEL 1

 INPUTS ARE BASED UPON UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS. OUR LEVEL 1 NON-DERIVATIVE

INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE U.S. TREASURIES, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND ACTIVELY TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS. OUR LEVEL 1 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDE THOSE ACTIVELY TRADED ON EXCHANGES.



LEVEL 2

 INPUTS ARE BASED UPON QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN

MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, AND MODEL-BASED VALUATION TECHNIQUES (E.G. THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL) FOR WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. WHERE

PART II

ITEM 8

APPLICABLE, THESE MODELS PROJECT FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNT THE FUTURE AMOUNTS TO A PRESENT VALUE USING MARKET-BASED OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE CURVES, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES,

AND FORWARD AND SPOT PRICES FOR CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES. OUR LEVEL 2 NON-DERIVATIVE INVESTMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AGENCY SECURITIES, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, AND COMMERCIAL PAPER. OUR

LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CERTAIN OVER-THE-COUNTER OPTION AND SWAP CONTRACTS.



LEVEL 3

 INPUTS ARE GENERALLY UNOBSERVABLE AND TYPICALLY REFLECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN

PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. THE FAIR VALUES ARE THEREFORE DETERMINED USING MODEL-BASED TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING OPTION PRICING MODELS AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS. OUR LEVEL 3 NON-DERIVATIVE ASSETS PRIMARILY COMPRISE INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN

CORPORATE BONDS. WE VALUE THESE CORPORATE BONDS USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED VALUATION MODELS, INPUTS TO WHICH INCLUDE INTEREST RATE CURVES, CREDIT SPREADS, STOCK PRICES, AND VOLATILITIES. UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN THESE MODELS ARE SIGNIFICANT

TO THE FAIR VALUES OF THE INVESTMENTS. OUR LEVEL 3 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PRIMARILY COMPRISE DERIVATIVES FOR FOREIGN EQUITIES. IN CERTAIN CASES, MARKET-BASED OBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AND WE USE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO DEVELOP

ASSUMPTIONS TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE FOR THESE DERIVATIVES.

WE MEASURE CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR COST AND EQUITY

METHOD INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON VALUATION TECHNIQUES USING THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE, AND MAY

INCLUDE QUOTED MARKET PRICES, MARKET COMPARABLES, AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS.

OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL LIABILITIES, INCLUDING

OUR SHORT-TERM DEBT, HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUES. OUR LONG-TERM FINANCIAL LIABILITIES CONSIST OF LONG-TERM DEBT WHICH IS RECORDED ON THE BALANCE SHEET AT ISSUANCE PRICE LESS UNAMORTIZED DISCOUNT.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL

HIGHLY LIQUID INTEREST-EARNING INVESTMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUES. IN GENERAL, INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL

MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES BEYOND ONE YEAR MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM BASED ON THEIR HIGHLY LIQUID NATURE AND

BECAUSE SUCH MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT THE INVESTMENT OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. ALL CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED USING THE

SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE, EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, ARE REFLECTED IN OCI.

EQUITY AND

OTHER INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM INCLUDE BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. DEBT AND PUBLICLY-TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD.

CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE, EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, ARE REFLECTED IN OCI. COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK AND OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE RESTRICTED FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR OR ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRADED ARE RECORDED AT COST OR USING THE

EQUITY METHOD.

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE

CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOAN SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED

IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY.

INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS

JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED BASED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MARKET INFORMATION OR OTHER ESTIMATES DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT. WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND

QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND

EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO SELL,

THE INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE

RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE

A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED.

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE

OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON THE INTENDED USE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND THE RESULTING DESIGNATION.

FOR A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DESIGNATED AS

A FAIR-VALUE HEDGE, THE GAIN (LOSS) IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIOD OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE OFFSETTING LOSS OR GAIN ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTED TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS FAIR-VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME

VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS

CASH-FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE DERIVATIVES GAIN (LOSS) IS INITIALLY REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED EXPOSURE IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS

CASH-FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. GAINS (LOSSES) ON DERIVATIVES REPRESENTING EITHER HEDGE COMPONENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS OR

HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES, GAINS (LOSSES) FROM

CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES ARE PRIMARILY RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE). OTHER THAN THOSE DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, SUCH AS COMMODITY CONTRACTS, THE GAINS (LOSSES) ARE GENERALLY ECONOMICALLY OFFSET BY UNREALIZED GAINS

(LOSSES) IN THE UNDERLYING AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI UNTIL THE SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, AT WHICH TIME THE AMOUNTS ARE MOVED FROM OCI INTO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS REFLECTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE. WE DETERMINE THE

ALLOWANCE BASED ON KNOWN TROUBLED ACCOUNTS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND OTHER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. ACTIVITY IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WAS AS FOLLOWS.

15 YEARS; LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, TWO TO 10 YEARS; AND FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT, ONE TO FIVE YEARS. LAND IS NOT DEPRECIATED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT USING A FAIR-VALUE-BASED APPROACH ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF INDICATORS OF

POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT EXIST.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ALL OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION AND ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR ESTIMATED PERIOD OF BENEFIT,

RANGING FROM ONE TO 10 YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS PERIODICALLY BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY WARRANT REVISED ESTIMATES OF USEFUL LIVES OR THAT INDICATE THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

RECENTLY ADOPTED

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

IN JANUARY 2010, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE TO AMEND THE

DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO RECURRING AND NONRECURRING FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES NEW DISCLOSURES ON THE TRANSFERS OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES BETWEEN LEVEL 1 (QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKET FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR

LIABILITIES) AND LEVEL 2 (SIGNIFICANT OTHER OBSERVABLE INPUTS) OF THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT HIERARCHY, INCLUDING THE REASONS AND THE TIMING OF THE TRANSFERS. ADDITIONALLY, THE GUIDANCE REQUIRES A ROLL FORWARD OF ACTIVITIES ON PURCHASES, SALES,

ISSUANCE, AND SETTLEMENTS OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING SIGNIFICANT UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS (LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS). THE GUIDANCE BECAME EFFECTIVE FOR US WITH THE REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2010, EXCEPT FOR THE

DISCLOSURE ON THE ROLL FORWARD ACTIVITIES FOR LEVEL 3 FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, WHICH WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR US WITH THE REPORTING PERIOD BEGINNING JULY 1, 2011. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE DID

NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. SEE NOTE 6  FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS.

ON JULY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED

GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FASB ON BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. THE GUIDANCE RETAINS THE FUNDAMENTAL REQUIREMENTS THAT THE ACQUISITION METHOD OF ACCOUNTING (PREVIOUSLY REFERRED TO AS THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING) BE USED FOR ALL BUSINESS COMBINATIONS,

BUT REQUIRES A NUMBER OF CHANGES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE WAY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED AND MEASURED AS A RESULT OF BUSINESS COMBINATIONS. IT ALSO REQUIRES THE CAPITALIZATION OF IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AT FAIR VALUE AND

REQUIRES THE EXPENSING OF ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS AS INCURRED. WE HAVE APPLIED THIS GUIDANCE TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS COMPLETED SINCE JULY 1, 2009.

ON JULY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED GUIDANCE ISSUED BY THE FASB THAT CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS.

NON-CONTROLLING INTERESTS ARE TO BE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF EQUITY SEPARATE FROM THE PARENTS EQUITY, AND PURCHASES OR SALES OF EQUITY INTERESTS THAT DO NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE IN CONTROL ARE TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS EQUITY TRANSACTIONS. IN

ADDITION, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO A NON-CONTROLLING INTEREST IS TO BE INCLUDED IN NET INCOME AND, UPON A LOSS OF CONTROL, THE INTEREST SOLD, AS WELL AS ANY INTEREST RETAINED, IS TO BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH ANY GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNIZED IN NET

INCOME. ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

ON JULY 1, 2009, WE ADOPTED

GUIDANCE ON FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT FOR NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, EXCEPT FOR ITEMS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY). ADOPTION OF THE NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT

HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED

IN OCTOBER 2009, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON REVENUE RECOGNITION THAT WILL BECOME EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2010. UNDER THE NEW

GUIDANCE ON ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, TANGIBLE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE SOFTWARE COMPONENTS THAT ARE ESSENTIAL TO THE FUNCTIONALITY OF THE TANGIBLE PRODUCT WILL NO LONGER BE WITHIN THE SCOPE OF THE SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE,

AND SOFTWARE-ENABLED PRODUCTS WILL NOW BE SUBJECT TO OTHER RELEVANT REVENUE RECOGNITION GUIDANCE. ADDITIONALLY, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON REVENUE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE DELIVERABLES THAT ARE OUTSIDE THE SCOPE OF THE SOFTWARE REVENUE

RECOGNITION GUIDANCE. UNDER THE NEW GUIDANCE, WHEN VENDOR SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OR THIRD PARTY EVIDENCE FOR DELIVERABLES IN AN ARRANGEMENT CANNOT BE DETERMINED, A BEST ESTIMATE OF THE SELLING PRICE IS REQUIRED TO SEPARATE DELIVERABLES AND

ALLOCATE ARRANGEMENT CONSIDERATION USING THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD. THE NEW GUIDANCE INCLUDES NEW DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ON HOW THE APPLICATION OF THE RELATIVE SELLING PRICE METHOD AFFECTS THE TIMING AND AMOUNT OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. WE

BELIEVE ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN JUNE 2009, THE FASB ISSUED

GUIDANCE ON THE CONSOLIDATION OF VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, WHICH IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2010. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES REVISED EVALUATIONS OF WHETHER ENTITIES REPRESENT VARIABLE INTEREST ENTITIES, ONGOING ASSESSMENTS OF

CONTROL OVER SUCH ENTITIES, AND ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES FOR VARIABLE INTERESTS. WE BELIEVE ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOTE 2  EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EARNINGS

PER SHARE IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PLUS THE EFFECT OF DILUTIVE POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. DILUTIVE POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES INCLUDE

UNREALIZED LOSSES FROM FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES ARE PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO CHANGES IN INTEREST

RATES. UNREALIZED LOSSES FROM DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES ARE DUE TO MARKET PRICE MOVEMENTS. MANAGEMENT DOES NOT BELIEVE ANY REMAINING UNREALIZED LOSSES REPRESENT OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS BASED ON OUR EVALUATION OF AVAILABLE EVIDENCE

AS OF JUNE 30, 2010.

AT JUNE 30, 2010 AND 2009, THE RECORDED BASES AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES OF COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK

AND OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE RESTRICTED FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR OR ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRADED WERE $216 MILLION AND $204 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

NOTE 5  DERIVATIVES

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND CREDIT; TO ENHANCE

INVESTMENT RETURNS; AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. OUR OBJECTIVES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVES INCLUDE REDUCING, ELIMINATING, AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THESE EXPOSURES AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. OUR DERIVATIVE

PROGRAMS INCLUDE STRATEGIES THAT BOTH QUALIFY AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. ALL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS PRESENTED BELOW ARE MEASURED IN U.S. CURRENCY EQUIVALENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

CERTAIN FORECASTED

TRANSACTIONS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE POSITIONS. OPTION AND FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE USED TO

HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INTERNATIONAL REVENUE FOR UP TO THREE YEARS IN THE FUTURE AND ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. AS OF

JUNE 30, 2010 AND 2009, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS SOLD WERE $9.3 BILLION AND $7.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS RELATED TO CERTAIN NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES ARE HEDGED USING

FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR-VALUE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010 AND 2009, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS SOLD WERE $523 MILLION AND $3.5 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. CERTAIN OPTIONS AND FORWARDS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO USED TO MANAGE THE VARIABILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, CASH, AND INTERCOMPANY POSITIONS, AND TO MANAGE OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXPOSURES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $7.8 BILLION AND $5.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2009, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $3.2 BILLION AND $3.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

EQUITY

SECURITIES HELD IN OUR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. MARKET PRICE RISK IS MANAGED RELATIVE TO

BROAD-BASED GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC EQUITY INDICES USING CERTAIN CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED INVESTMENTS, OPTIONS, FUTURES, AND SWAP CONTRACTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, TO HEDGE OUR PRICE RISK, WE MAY USE AND DESIGNATE EQUITY

DERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING PUTS, CALLS, SWAPS, AND FORWARDS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED EQUITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $918 MILLION AND $472 MILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2009, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED EQUITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE IMMATERIAL.

57

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

INTEREST RATE

SECURITIES HELD IN OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTEREST RATE RISKS BASED ON THEIR MATURITIES. WE MANAGE THE AVERAGE

MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN BROAD-BASED FIXED-INCOME INDICES USING EXCHANGE-TRADED OPTION AND FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OVER-THE-COUNTER SWAP AND OPTION CONTRACTS, NONE OF WHICH ARE

DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF FIXED-INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $3.1 BILLION AND $1.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2009, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF

FIXED-INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $2.7 BILLION AND $456 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. IN ADDITION, WE USE TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED

SECURITIES. THESE MEET THE DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IN CASES WHERE PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE ASSETS IS NOT TAKEN AT THE EARLIEST AVAILABLE DELIVERY DATE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010 AND 2009, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL DERIVATIVE AMOUNT OF

MORTGAGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED WERE IMMATERIAL AND $1.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT

OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. WE USE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP CONTRACTS, NOT

DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO MANAGE CREDIT EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO BROAD-BASED INDICES AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. WE USE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS AS THEY ARE A LOW COST METHOD OF MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISKS OR

GROUPS OF CREDIT RISKS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010 AND 2009, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE IMMATERIAL.

COMMODITY

WE USE BROAD-BASED COMMODITY

EXPOSURES TO ENHANCE PORTFOLIO RETURNS AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. WE USE SWAP, FUTURES AND OPTION CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO GENERATE AND MANAGE EXPOSURES TO BROAD-BASED COMMODITY INDICES. WE USE

DERIVATIVES ON COMMODITIES AS THEY CAN BE LOW-COST ALTERNATIVES TO THE PURCHASE AND STORAGE OF A VARIETY OF COMMODITIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRECIOUS METALS, ENERGY, AND GRAIN. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF

COMMODITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.1 BILLION AND $376 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2009, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF COMMODITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $543 MILLION AND $33 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

CERTAIN OF OUR COUNTERPARTY AGREEMENTS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM UNSECURED

DEBT TO MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING AND REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN A MINIMUM LIQUIDITY OF $1.0 BILLION. TO THE EXTENT WE FAIL TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL, SIMILAR TO THE STANDARD CONVENTION RELATED

TO OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, OUR LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT RATING WAS AAA, AND CASH INVESTMENTS WERE IN EXCESS OF $1.0 BILLION. AS A RESULT, NO COLLATERAL IS REQUIRED TO BE POSTED.

NOTE 12  DEBT

IN SEPTEMBER 2008, OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED DEBT FINANCINGS OF UP TO $6.0 BILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, WE HAD $6.0 BILLION OF ISSUED

AND OUTSTANDING DEBT COMPRISED OF $1.0 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER AND $5.0 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING $1.25 BILLION OF CONVERTIBLE DEBT. CASH PAID FOR INTEREST ON OUR DEBT FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010 WAS $145 MILLION. NO CASH WAS PAID FOR

INTEREST ON OUR DEBT FOR FISCAL YEARS 2009 AND 2008.

SHORT-TERM DEBT

AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, OUR $1.0 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING HAD A WEIGHTED AVERAGE INTEREST RATE, INCLUDING ISSUANCE

COSTS, OF 0.20% AND MATURITIES OF 22 TO 216 DAYS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THIS COMMERCIAL PAPER APPROXIMATES ITS CARRYING VALUE.

IN

NOVEMBER 2009, WE REPLACED OUR $2.0 BILLION AND $1.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITIES WITH A $2.25 BILLION 364-DAY CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH EXPIRES ON NOVEMBER 5, 2010. THIS FACILITY SERVES AS A BACK-UP FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. IN JUNE 2010, WE

REDUCED THE SIZE OF OUR CREDIT FACILITY FROM $2.25 BILLION TO $1.0 BILLION DUE TO THE REDUCTION IN COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING. AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE FINANCIAL COVENANT IN THE CREDIT FACILITY AGREEMENT, WHICH

REQUIRES A COVERAGE RATIO BE MAINTAINED OF AT LEAST THREE TIMES EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION TO INTEREST EXPENSE. NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN AGAINST THE CREDIT FACILITY DURING ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

LONG-TERM DEBT

NOTES

AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, WE HAD ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING $3.75 BILLION OF DEBT SECURITIES AS ILLUSTRATED IN THE TABLE BELOW (COLLECTIVELY THE

NOTES). INTEREST ON THE NOTES IS PAYABLE SEMI-ANNUALLY ON JUNE 1 AND DECEMBER 1 OF EACH YEAR, TO HOLDERS OF RECORD ON THE PRECEDING MAY 15 AND NOVEMBER 15. THE NOTES ARE SENIOR UNSECURED OBLIGATIONS AND RANK EQUALLY

WITH OUR OTHER UNSECURED AND UNSUBORDINATED DEBT OUTSTANDING.

CONVERTIBLE DEBT

IN JUNE 2010, WE ISSUED $1.25 BILLION OF ZERO COUPON CONVERTIBLE UNSECURED DEBT DUE ON JUNE 15, 2013 IN A PRIVATE PLACEMENT OFFERING. PROCEEDS

FROM THE OFFERING WERE $1.24 BILLION, NET OF FEES AND EXPENSES WHICH WERE CAPITALIZED. THE MAJORITY OF THE PROCEEDS WERE USED TO REPAY OUTSTANDING COMMERCIAL PAPER, LEAVING $1.0 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER OUTSTANDING AS OF JUNE 30, 2010. EACH

$1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NOTES IS CONVERTIBLE INTO 29.94 SHARES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE OF $33.40 PER SHARE.

PRIOR TO MARCH 15, 2013, THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE, ONLY IN CERTAIN CIRCUMSTANCES, INTO CASH AND, IF APPLICABLE, CASH, SHARES OF

MICROSOFTS COMMON STOCK OR A COMBINATION THEREOF, AT OUR ELECTION. ON OR AFTER MARCH 15, 2013, THE NOTES WILL BE CONVERTIBLE AT ANY TIME. UPON CONVERSION, WE WILL PAY CASH UP TO THE AGGREGATE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF THE NOTES AND PAY OR

DELIVER CASH, SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK OR A COMBINATION OF CASH AND SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK, AT OUR ELECTION.

BECAUSE THE

CONVERTIBLE DEBT MAY BE WHOLLY OR PARTIALLY SETTLED IN CASH, WE ARE REQUIRED TO SEPARATELY ACCOUNT FOR THE LIABILITY AND EQUITY COMPONENTS OF THE NOTES IN A MANNER THAT REFLECTS OUR NONCONVERTIBLE DEBT BORROWING RATE WHEN INTEREST COSTS ARE

RECOGNIZED IN SUBSEQUENT PERIODS. THE NET PROCEEDS OF $1.24 BILLION WERE ALLOCATED BETWEEN DEBT FOR $1.18 BILLION AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY FOR $58 MILLION WITH THE PORTION IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY REPRESENTING THE FAIR VALUE OF THE OPTION

TO CONVERT THE DEBT.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES, WE ENTERED INTO CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS WITH CERTAIN OPTION

COUNTERPARTIES WHO ARE INITIAL PURCHASERS OF THE NOTES OR THEIR AFFILIATES. THE CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REDUCE POTENTIAL DILUTION OF EARNINGS PER SHARE UPON CONVERSION OF THE NOTES. UNDER THE CAPPED CALL TRANSACTIONS, WE PURCHASED

FROM THE OPTION COUNTERPARTIES CAPPED CALL OPTIONS THAT IN THE AGGREGATE RELATE TO THE TOTAL NUMBER OF SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDERLYING THE NOTES, WITH A STRIKE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CONVERSION PRICE OF THE NOTES AND WITH A CAP PRICE EQUAL TO

$37.16. THE PURCHASED CAPPED CALLS WERE VALUED AT $40 MILLION AND RECORDED TO STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, THE

TOTAL CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING CONVERTIBLE DEBT, WERE $4.94 BILLION AND $5.21 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON QUOTED PRICES FOR OUR PUBLICLY-TRADED DEBT AS OF

JUNE 30, 2010, AS APPLICABLE. THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST YIELDS OF THE NOTES DUE IN 2014, 2019, AND 2039 WERE 3.00%, 4.29%, AND 5.22%, RESPECTIVELY, AT JUNE 30, 2010. THE EFFECTIVE INTEREST YIELD OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT DUE IN 2013 IS 1.85% AT

JUNE 30, 2010 AND THE COUPON INTEREST RATE IS ZERO PERCENT.

WE HAVE NOT PROVIDED DEFERRED U.S. INCOME TAXES OR FOREIGN WITHHOLDING TAXES ON TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES OF APPROXIMATELY $29.5 BILLION RESULTING FROM

EARNINGS FOR CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES WHICH ARE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED OUTSIDE THE U.S. THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IS APPROXIMATELY $9.2 BILLION.

YAHOO! COMMERCIAL AGREEMENT

ON DECEMBER 4, 2009, WE ENTERED INTO A DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT WITH YAHOO! WHEREBY MICROSOFT WILL PROVIDE THE EXCLUSIVE ALGORITHMIC AND PAID

SEARCH PLATFORM FOR YAHOO! WEB SITES. THE TRANSACTION RECEIVED CLEARANCE, WITHOUT RESTRICTIONS, FROM BOTH THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION DURING THE THIRD FISCAL QUARTER OF 2010. THE TERM OF THE AGREEMENT IS 10 YEARS

SUBJECT TO TERMINATION PROVISIONS AFTER FIVE YEARS BASED ON PERFORMANCE.

MICROSOFT PROVIDED YAHOO! COUNTRY LEVEL REVENUE PER SEARCH

GUARANTEES FOR A PERIOD OF 18 MONTHS AFTER IMPLEMENTATION OF THE BING SEARCH PLATFORM. THESE GUARANTEES ARE CALCULATED, PAID, AND TRUED-UP IN THREE SIX-MONTH PERIODS THEREAFTER, AND ARE INTENDED TO INSURE YAHOO! AGAINST ANY PERSISTENT DROP IN

REVENUE PER SEARCH FROM PRE-IMPLEMENTATION LEVELS. THIS IS A RATE GUARANTEE NOT A GUARANTEE OF SEARCH VOLUME. WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL COST OF THE REVENUE PER SEARCH GUARANTEES DURING THE GUARANTEE PERIOD COULD RANGE BETWEEN ZERO AND $150 MILLION;

HOWEVER, NO AMOUNT HAS BEEN RECORDED FOR THE REVENUE PER SEARCH GUARANTEES AS WE DO NOT BELIEVE THAT SUCH LIABILITY EXISTS AT THIS TIME.

MICROSOFT ALSO AGREED TO REIMBURSE YAHOO! FOR CERTAIN TRANSITION EXPENSES INCURRED BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE AGREEMENT.

GOVERNMENT COMPETITION LAW MATTERS

IN MARCH 2004, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ISSUED A COMPETITION LAW DECISION THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ORDERED US TO LICENSE CERTAIN WINDOWS

SERVER PROTOCOL TECHNOLOGY TO OUR COMPETITORS. IN MARCH 2007, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ISSUED A STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS CLAIMING THAT THE PRICING TERMS WE PROPOSED FOR LICENSING THE TECHNOLOGY AS REQUIRED BY THE MARCH 2004 DECISION WERE

NOT REASONABLE. FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL STEPS WE TOOK TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS, THE COMMISSION ANNOUNCED ON OCTOBER 22, 2007 THAT WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MARCH 2004 DECISION AND THAT NO FURTHER PENALTY SHOULD ACCRUE AFTER THAT

DATE. ON FEBRUARY 27, 2008, THE COMMISSION ISSUED A FINE OF $1.4 BILLION (



899 MILLION) RELATING TO THE PERIOD PRIOR TO

OCTOBER 22, 2007. IN MAY 2008, WE FILED AN APPLICATION WITH THE EUROPEAN COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE TO ANNUL THE FEBRUARY 2008 FINE. WE PAID THE $1.4 BILLION

(



899 MILLION) FINE IN JUNE 2008, PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE APPEAL.

IN JANUARY 2008, THE COMMISSION OPENED A COMPETITION LAW INVESTIGATION THAT RELATES PRIMARILY TO INTEROPERABILITY WITH RESPECT TO OUR MICROSOFT

OFFICE FAMILY OF PRODUCTS. THIS INVESTIGATION RESULTED FROM COMPLAINTS FILED WITH THE COMMISSION BY A TRADE ASSOCIATION OF MICROSOFTS COMPETITORS. MICROSOFT HAS MADE A NUMBER OF PROPOSALS TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSIONS COMPETITION LAW

CONCERNS IN THIS AREA. THE COMMISSION ANNOUNCED ON DECEMBER 16, 2009 THAT IT WELCOMED THESE PROPOSALS AND THAT IT WILL TAKE THEM INTO ACCOUNT IN ASSESSING THIS MATTER. DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2010, THE TRADE ASSOCIATION

WITHDREW ITS COMPLAINT THAT WAS THE BASIS OF THE INVESTIGATION.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A CONSENT DECREE AND FINAL JUDGMENT (FINAL JUDGMENTS) THAT

RESOLVED LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 18 STATES, AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN TWO SEPARATE ACTIONS. THE FINAL JUDGMENTS IMPOSED VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS ON OUR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM BUSINESSES. THE FINAL JUDGMENTS ARE

SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE IN MAY 2011.

IN OTHER ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND SEVERAL STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE

REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM US CONCERNING COMPETITION, PRIVACY, AND SECURITY ISSUES.

ANTITRUST, UNFAIR COMPETITION, AND OVERCHARGE CLASS ACTIONS

A LARGE NUMBER OF ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST US IN VARIOUS STATE, FEDERAL, AND CANADIAN

COURTS ON BEHALF OF VARIOUS CLASSES OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT PURCHASERS OF OUR PC OPERATING SYSTEM AND CERTAIN OTHER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. WE OBTAINED DISMISSALS OF DAMAGES CLAIMS OF INDIRECT PURCHASERS UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND IN 15 STATES. COURTS REFUSED

TO CERTIFY CLASSES IN TWO ADDITIONAL STATES. WE HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS TO SETTLE ALL CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO DATE IN 19 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

THE SETTLEMENTS IN ALL STATES HAVE RECEIVED FINAL COURT APPROVAL. UNDER THE SETTLEMENTS, GENERALLY CLASS MEMBERS CAN OBTAIN VOUCHERS THAT ENTITLE

THEM TO BE REIMBURSED FOR PURCHASES OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PLATFORM-NEUTRAL COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. THE TOTAL VALUE OF VOUCHERS THAT WE MAY ISSUE VARIES BY STATE. WE WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN SCHOOLS A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE VOUCHERS THAT

ARE NOT ISSUED OR CLAIMED (ONE-HALF TO TWO-THIRDS DEPENDING ON THE STATE). THE TOTAL VALUE OF VOUCHERS WE ULTIMATELY ISSUE WILL DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBERS WHO MAKE CLAIMS AND ARE ISSUED VOUCHERS. THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF VOUCHERS TO BE ISSUED

IS APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION. THE ACTUAL COSTS OF THESE SETTLEMENTS WILL BE LESS THAN THAT MAXIMUM AMOUNT, DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBERS AND SCHOOLS THAT ARE ISSUED AND REDEEM VOUCHERS. WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL COST TO RESOLVE ALL OF THE

STATE OVERCHARGE CLASS ACTION CASES WILL RANGE BETWEEN $1.9 BILLION AND $2.0 BILLION. AT JUNE 30, 2010, WE HAVE RECORDED A LIABILITY RELATED TO THESE CLAIMS OF APPROXIMATELY $651 MILLION, WHICH REFLECTS OUR ESTIMATED EXPOSURE OF $1.9 BILLION

LESS PAYMENTS MADE TO DATE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.2 BILLION MOSTLY FOR VOUCHERS, LEGAL FEES, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

THE THREE CASES

PENDING IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, ONTARIO, AND QUEBEC, CANADA HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED. IN MARCH 2010, THE COURT IN THE BRITISH COLUMBIA CASE CERTIFIED IT AS A CLASS ACTION. WE HAVE APPEALED THIS RULING. THE OTHER TWO ACTIONS HAVE BEEN STAYED.

OTHER ANTITRUST LITIGATION AND CLAIMS

IN

NOVEMBER 2004, NOVELL, INC. FILED A COMPLAINT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH (LATER TRANSFERRED TO FEDERAL COURT IN MARYLAND), ASSERTING ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLAIMS AGAINST US RELATED TO NOVELLS OWNERSHIP OF

WORDPERFECT AND OTHER PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN JUNE 1994 AND MARCH 1996. IN JUNE 2005, THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED OUR MOTION TO DISMISS FOUR OF SIX CLAIMS OF THE COMPLAINT. ON MARCH 30, 2010, THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED

SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MICROSOFT AS TO ALL REMAINING CLAIMS. NOVELL HAS APPEALED THAT RULING.

PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS

IN 2003, WE FILED AN ACTION IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN CALIFORNIA SEEKING A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT WE DO NOT INFRINGE CERTAIN

ALCATEL-LUCENT PATENTS (ALTHOUGH THIS ACTION BEGAN BEFORE THE MERGER OF ALCATEL AND LUCENT IN 2006, FOR SIMPLICITY WE REFER TO THE POST-MERGER ENTITY OF ALCATEL-LUCENT). IN APRIL 2008, A JURY RETURNED A VERDICT IN ALCATEL-LUCENTS FAVOR IN A

TRIAL ON A CONSOLIDATED GROUP OF ONE VIDEO AND THREE USER INTERFACE PATENTS. THE JURY CONCLUDED THAT WE HAD INFRINGED TWO USER INTERFACE PATENTS AND AWARDED $367 MILLION IN DAMAGES. IN JUNE 2008, THE TRIAL JUDGE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES TO

$512 MILLION TO INCLUDE $145 MILLION OF INTEREST. WE APPEALED THAT AWARD TO THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT. IN DECEMBER 2008, WE ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT AGREEMENT RESOLVING ALL OTHER LITIGATION PENDING BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND ALCATEL-LUCENT, LEAVING

APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION REMAINING IN DISPUTE. IN SEPTEMBER 2009, THE UNITED STATES COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT AFFIRMED THE LIABILITY AWARD BUT VACATED THE VERDICT AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE TRIAL COURT FOR A RE-TRIAL OF THE

DAMAGES RULING, INDICATING THE DAMAGES PREVIOUSLY AWARDED WERE TOO HIGH. TRIAL ON THE REMANDED DAMAGES CLAIM HAS BEEN SET FOR THE FIRST WEEK OF DECEMBER 2010.

IN OCTOBER 2003, UNILOC USA INC., A SUBSIDIARY OF A SINGAPORE-BASED SECURITY TECHNOLOGY COMPANY,

FILED A PATENT INFRINGEMENT SUIT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN RHODE ISLAND, CLAIMING THAT PRODUCT ACTIVATION TECHNOLOGY IN WINDOWS XP AND CERTAIN OTHER MICROSOFT PROGRAMS VIOLATED A UNILOC PATENT. AFTER WE OBTAINED A FAVORABLE SUMMARY JUDGMENT THAT WE

DID NOT INFRINGE ANY OF THE CLAIMS OF THIS PATENT, THE COURT OF APPEALS VACATED THE TRIAL COURT DECISION AND REMANDED THE CASE FOR TRIAL. IN APRIL 2009, THE JURY RETURNED A $388 MILLION VERDICT AGAINST US, INCLUDING A FINDING OF WILLFUL

INFRINGEMENT. IN SEPTEMBER 2009, THE DISTRICT COURT JUDGE OVERTURNED THE JURY VERDICT, RULING THAT THE EVIDENCE DID NOT SUPPORT THE JURYS FINDING THAT MICROSOFT INFRINGED THE PATENT. UNILOC HAS APPEALED.

IN MARCH 2007, I4I LIMITED PARTNERSHIP SUED MICROSOFT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN TEXAS CLAIMING THAT CERTAIN CUSTOM XML TECHNOLOGY IN WORD 2003 AND

2007 INFRINGED I4IS PATENT. IN MAY 2009, A JURY RETURNED A VERDICT AGAINST US, FINDING DAMAGES OF $200 MILLION AND THAT WE WILLFULLY INFRINGED THE PATENT. IN AUGUST 2009, THE COURT DENIED OUR POST-TRIAL MOTIONS AND AWARDED ENHANCED DAMAGES OF

$40 MILLION AND PREJUDGMENT INTEREST OF $37 MILLION. THE COURT ALSO ISSUED A PERMANENT INJUNCTION PROHIBITING ADDITIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF THE ALLEGEDLY INFRINGING TECHNOLOGY. WE APPEALED AND THE APPELLATE COURT STAYED THE INJUNCTION PENDING OUR

APPEAL. ON DECEMBER 22, 2009, THE COURT OF APPEALS REJECTED OUR APPEAL AND AFFIRMED THE TRIAL COURTS JUDGMENT AND INJUNCTION, EXCEPT THAT THE COURT OF APPEALS MODIFIED THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF THE INJUNCTION TO JANUARY 11, 2010. ON

APRIL 1, 2010, THE COURT OF APPEALS DENIED OUR REQUEST FOR A REHEARING. WE INTEND TO SEEK REVIEW BY THE U.S. SUPREME COURT.

IN

2007, VIRNETX INC. BROUGHT SUIT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN TEXAS CLAIMING THAT VARIOUS MICROSOFT PRODUCTS INCLUDING WINDOWS CLIENT AND SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS SOFTWARE AND COMMUNICATIONS SOFTWARE INFRINGE TWO PATENTS RELATED TO TECHNOLOGY FOR

SECURELY COMMUNICATING OVER THE INTERNET. THIS CASE WAS TRIED BY A JURY IN MARCH 2010. THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT THAT MICROSOFT WILLFULLY INFRINGED BOTH PATENTS, AND FOUND DAMAGES OF APPROXIMATELY $106 MILLION. IN MARCH 2010,

VIRNETX FILED A NEW LAWSUIT IN THE EASTERN DISTRICT OF TEXAS ALLEGING THAT ADDITIONAL MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDING WINDOWS 7 AND WINDOWS SERVER 2008 R2 INFRINGE THE SAME TWO PATENTS. THE PARTIES HAVE REACHED AN AGREEMENT TO SETTLE BOTH

LAWSUITS.

WE ALSO ARE

SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF OTHER CLAIMS AND SUITS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT RESOLVING CLAIMS AGAINST US, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THESE MATTERS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, WE HAD ACCRUED AGGREGATE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $1.0 BILLION IN OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES AND APPROXIMATELY $236

MILLION IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES FOR ALL OF THE CONTINGENT MATTERS DESCRIBED IN THIS NOTE. WHILE WE INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THESE MATTERS, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES THAT WE ESTIMATE COULD REACH APPROXIMATELY $800

STOCK PLANS

WE HAVE STOCK

PLANS FOR DIRECTORS AND FOR OFFICERS, EMPLOYEES, CONSULTANTS, AND ADVISORS. AT JUNE 30, 2010, AN AGGREGATE OF 690 MILLION SHARES WERE AUTHORIZED FOR FUTURE GRANT UNDER OUR STOCK PLANS, WHICH COVER STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK AWARDS, AND SHARED

PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS. AWARDS THAT EXPIRE OR ARE CANCELED WITHOUT DELIVERY OF SHARES GENERALLY BECOME AVAILABLE FOR ISSUANCE UNDER THE PLANS. WE ISSUE NEW SHARES TO SATISFY EXERCISES AND VESTINGS OF AWARDS GRANTED UNDER ALL OF OUR STOCK PLANS.

STOCK AWARDS

STOCK AWARDS

(SAS) ARE GRANTS THAT ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO SHARES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK AS THE AWARD VESTS. OUR SAS GENERALLY VEST OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.

SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS

SHARED

PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS (SPSAS) ARE A FORM OF SA IN WHICH THE NUMBER OF SHARES ULTIMATELY RECEIVED DEPENDS ON OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AGAINST SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE TARGETS.

WE GRANTED SPSAS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2010, 2009, AND 2008 WITH PERFORMANCE PERIODS OF JULY 1, 2009 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2010, JULY 1,

2008 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2009, AND JULY 1, 2007 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2008, RESPECTIVELY. IN SEPTEMBER FOLLOWING THE END OF EACH PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK SUBJECT TO THE AWARD IS DETERMINED BY MULTIPLYING THE TARGET

AWARD BY A PERCENTAGE RANGING FROM 0% TO 150%. THE PERCENTAGE IS BASED ON PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. AN ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF SHARES,

APPROXIMATELY 12% OF THE TOTAL TARGET SPSAS, ARE AVAILABLE AS ADDITIONAL AWARDS TO PARTICIPANTS BASED ON INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE. ONE-QUARTER OF THE SHARES OF STOCK SUBJECT TO EACH AWARD VEST FOLLOWING THE END OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, AND AN

ADDITIONAL ONE-QUARTER OF THE SHARES VEST ON EACH OF THE FOLLOWING THREE ANNIVERSARIES OF THE GRANT DATE.

EXECUTIVE OFFICER INCENTIVE PLAN

IN FISCAL YEAR 2009, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE APPROVED A NEW EXECUTIVE OFFICER INCENTIVE PLAN (EOIP) FOR EXECUTIVE

OFFICERS OF THE COMPANY. THE EOIP REPLACED THE ANNUAL CASH BONUS OPPORTUNITY AND EQUITY AWARD PLANS FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS. UNDER THE EOIP, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE MAKES AWARDS OF PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION FOR SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE

PERIODS. FOR FISCAL YEARS 2010 AND 2009, EXECUTIVE OFFICERS WERE ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE ANNUAL AWARDS COMPRISED OF CASH AND SAS FROM AN INCENTIVE POOL EQUAL TO A PERCENTAGE OF THE COMPANYS OPERATING INCOME. FOR FISCAL YEAR 2010 IT WAS 0.45%

OF OPERATING INCOME, AND FOR FISCAL YEAR 2009 IT WAS 0.35% OF OPERATING INCOME. FOLLOWING APPROVAL OF THE AWARDS, 20% OF THE AWARD IS PAYABLE TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN CASH, AND THE REMAINING 80% IS CONVERTED INTO AN SA FOR SHARES OF MICROSOFT

COMMON STOCK. THE SA PORTION OF THE AWARD VESTS ONE-QUARTER IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE AWARD IS APPROVED FOLLOWING FISCAL YEAR-END, AND ONE-QUARTER ON AUGUST 31 OF EACH OF THE FOLLOWING THREE YEARS.

WE GRANT AWARDS FROM THE INCENTIVE POOL TO THE EXECUTIVE OFFICERS IN SEPTEMBER FOLLOWING THE END

OUR OVERALL NUMBER OF POSITIONS BY APPROXIMATELY 5,000 AND HEADCOUNT BY APPROXIMATELY 4,600.

IN NOVEMBER 2009, WE IDENTIFIED AN

ADDITIONAL 800 POSITIONS FOR ELIMINATION BASED ON OUR EFFORTS TO MANAGE OUR EXPENSES. SEVERANCE EXPENSE OF APPROXIMATELY $52 MILLION ASSOCIATED WITH THESE ADDITIONAL ELIMINATIONS WAS REFLECTED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. WE HAVE NOW COMPLETED THIS

JUNE 30, 2010 AND 2009, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, CASH FLOWS, AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2010. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF

THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR THE COMPANY. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES MAINTAINING RECORDS THAT IN REASONABLE DETAIL ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT OUR TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE

RECORDED AS NECESSARY FOR PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF COMPANY ASSETS ARE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZATION; AND PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF COMPANY ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IS NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT A MISSTATEMENT OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED.

MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL

CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF

JUNE 30, 2010, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR

MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS

AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR

DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT

LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO,

PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2010, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2010, OF THE COMPANY AND OUR REPORT DATED JULY 30, 2010, EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
