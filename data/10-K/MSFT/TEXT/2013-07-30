ITEM 1. BUSINESS

GENERAL

MICROSOFT WAS

FOUNDED IN 1975. OUR MISSION IS TO ENABLE PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO REALIZE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL BY CREATING TECHNOLOGY THAT TRANSFORMS THE WAY PEOPLE WORK, PLAY, AND COMMUNICATE. WE DEVELOP AND MARKET SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND

HARDWARE DEVICES THAT DELIVER NEW OPPORTUNITIES, GREATER CONVENIENCE, AND ENHANCED VALUE TO PEOPLES LIVES. WE DO BUSINESS WORLDWIDE AND HAVE OFFICES IN MORE THAN 100 COUNTRIES.

WE GENERATE REVENUE BY DEVELOPING, LICENSING, AND SUPPORTING A WIDE RANGE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, BY DESIGNING AND SELLING HARDWARE

DEVICES, AND BY DELIVERING RELEVANT ONLINE ADVERTISING TO A GLOBAL CUSTOMER AUDIENCE. IN ADDITION TO SELLING INDIVIDUAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE OFFER SUITES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

OUR PRODUCTS INCLUDE OPERATING SYSTEMS FOR COMPUTING DEVICES, SERVERS, PHONES, AND OTHER INTELLIGENT DEVICES; SERVER APPLICATIONS FOR DISTRIBUTED

COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS; PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS; BUSINESS SOLUTION APPLICATIONS; DESKTOP AND SERVER MANAGEMENT TOOLS; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS; VIDEO GAMES; AND ONLINE ADVERTISING. WE ALSO DESIGN AND SELL HARDWARE DEVICES INCLUDING SURFACE RT

AND SURFACE PRO, THE XBOX 360 GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLE, KINECT FOR XBOX 360, XBOX 360 ACCESSORIES, AND MICROSOFT PC ACCESSORIES.

WE OFFER CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS THAT PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND CONTENT OVER THE INTERNET BY WAY OF SHARED COMPUTING RESOURCES

LOCATED IN CENTRALIZED DATA CENTERS. EXAMPLES OF CLOUD-BASED COMPUTING SERVICES WE OFFER INCLUDE MICROSOFT OFFICE 365, MICROSOFT DYNAMICS CRM ONLINE, WINDOWS AZURE, BING, SKYPE, XBOX LIVE, AND YAMMER. CLOUD REVENUE IS EARNED PRIMARILY FROM USAGE

FEES, ADVERTISING, AND SUBSCRIPTIONS. WE ALSO PROVIDE CONSULTING AND PRODUCT AND SOLUTION SUPPORT SERVICES, AND WE TRAIN AND CERTIFY COMPUTER SYSTEM INTEGRATORS AND DEVELOPERS.

WE CONDUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOP ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES FOR FUTURE SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, AND SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO GROW AND

MEET OUR CUSTOMERS NEEDS BY DELIVERING A FAMILY OF DEVICES AND SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES THAT EMPOWER PEOPLE AROUND THE GLOBE AT HOME, AT WORK, AND ON THE GO, FOR THE ACTIVITIES THEY VALUE MOST. WE WILL CONTINUE TO CREATE NEW

OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERS, INCREASE CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, AND IMPROVE OUR SERVICE EXCELLENCE, BUSINESS EFFICACY, AND INTERNAL PROCESSES.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

DURING

THE PERIODS PRESENTED, WE OPERATED OUR BUSINESS IN FIVE SEGMENTS: WINDOWS DIVISION, SERVER AND TOOLS, ONLINE SERVICES DIVISION, MICROSOFT BUSINESS DIVISION, AND ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION. OUR SEGMENTS

ITEM 1

PROVIDE MANAGEMENT WITH A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL VIEW OF OUR KEY BUSINESSES. THE SEGMENTS ENABLE THE ALIGNMENT OF STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES ACROSS THE DEVELOPMENT, SALES, MARKETING, AND SERVICES

ORGANIZATIONS, AND THEY PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR TIMELY AND RATIONAL ALLOCATION OF DEVELOPMENT, SALES, MARKETING, AND SERVICES RESOURCES WITHIN BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT INFORMATION IS

CONTAINED IN NOTE 21  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART II, ITEM 8 OF THIS FORM 10-K). IN JULY 2013, WE ANNOUNCED A CHANGE IN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AS PART OF OUR TRANSFORMATION TO A

DEVICES AND SERVICES COMPANY. AS WE EVOLVE HOW WE ALLOCATE RESOURCES AND ANALYZE PERFORMANCE IN THE NEW STRUCTURE, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR SEGMENTS MAY CHANGE.

WINDOWS DIVISION

WINDOWS DIVISION DEVELOPS AND MARKETS OPERATING SYSTEMS FOR COMPUTING

DEVICES, RELATED SOFTWARE AND ONLINE SERVICES, SURFACE RT AND PRO DEVICES, AND PC ACCESSORIES. THIS COLLECTION OF SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, AND SERVICES IS DESIGNED TO EMPOWER INDIVIDUALS, COMPANIES, AND ORGANIZATIONS AND TO SIMPLIFY EVERYDAY TASKS

THROUGH SEAMLESS OPERATIONS ACROSS THE USERS HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. WINDOWS 8 IS THE FIRST VERSION OF THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM THAT SUPPORTS BOTH X86 AND ARM CHIP ARCHITECTURES AND THAT FOCUSES ON TOUCH. WITH THIS VERSION, WINDOWS IS ABLE

TO SCALE ACROSS MORE FORM FACTORS, INCLUDING MOBILE DEVICES DESIGNED FOR CONSUMING INFORMATION AND MEDIA, AND DEVICES THAT HAVE HIGH PERFORMANCE COMPUTING CAPABILITIES.

WINDOWS DIVISION REVENUE GROWTH IS IMPACTED BY GROWTH OF THE COMPUTING DEVICE MARKET WORLDWIDE. CURRENTLY, APPROXIMATELY 65% OF TOTAL WINDOWS DIVISION REVENUE COMES FROM WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS PURCHASED BY

ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS), WHICH THEY PRE-INSTALL ON THE DEVICES THEY SELL.

IN ADDITION TO COMPUTING DEVICE

MARKET VOLUME, WINDOWS REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY.



THE PROLIFERATION OF NEW COMPUTING DEVICES THAT EMPHASIZE TOUCH AND MOBILITY FUNCTIONALITY;



DEVICE MARKET CHANGES DRIVEN BY SHIFTS BETWEEN DEVELOPED MARKETS AND EMERGING MARKETS, AND CONSUMER DEVICES AND BUSINESS DEVICES;



ATTACHMENT OF WINDOWS TO DEVICES SHIPPED;



CHANGES IN INVENTORY LEVELS WITHIN THE OEM CHANNEL;



PRICING CHANGES AND PROMOTIONS, PRICING VARIATION THAT OCCURS WHEN THE MIX OF DEVICES MANUFACTURED SHIFTS FROM LOCAL AND REGIONAL SYSTEM BUILDERS TO LARGE,

MULTINATIONAL OEMS, AND DIFFERENT PRICING OF WINDOWS VERSIONS LICENSED;



DEMAND OF COMMERCIAL CUSTOMERS FOR VOLUME LICENSING AND SOFTWARE ASSURANCE;



COMPETITION

OUR XBOX GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT BUSINESS COMPETES WITH CONSOLE PLATFORMS FROM NINTENDO AND SONY, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE A LARGE, ESTABLISHED BASE OF CUSTOMERS. THE LIFECYCLE FOR GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES

AVERAGES FIVE TO 10 YEARS. WE RELEASED XBOX 360 IN NOVEMBER 2005. NINTENDO AND SONY RELEASED COMPETING VERSIONS OF THEIR GAME CONSOLES IN NOVEMBER 2006. IN JUNE 2013, WE ANNOUNCED THAT WE EXPECT OUR NEXT GENERATION CONSOLE, XBOX ONE, TO BE AVAILABLE

FOR PURCHASE IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2014. SONY ALSO ANNOUNCED THEIR NEXT GENERATION CONSOLE WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE IN LATE 2013. NINTENDO RELEASED THEIR LATEST GENERATION CONSOLE IN NOVEMBER 2012.

WE BELIEVE THE SUCCESS OF GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES IS DETERMINED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF GAMES FOR THE CONSOLE, PROVIDING EXCLUSIVE GAME

CONTENT THAT GAMERS SEEK, THE COMPUTATIONAL POWER AND RELIABILITY OF THE CONSOLE, AND THE ABILITY TO CREATE NEW EXPERIENCES VIA ONLINE SERVICES, DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT, AND PERIPHERALS. IN ADDITION TO NINTENDO AND SONY, OUR BUSINESSES COMPETE WITH

BOTH APPLE AND GOOGLE IN OFFERING CONTENT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO THE CONSUMER. WE BELIEVE THE XBOX ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM IS POSITIONED WELL AGAINST COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BASED ON SIGNIFICANT INNOVATION IN HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE,

USER INTERFACE, DEVELOPER TOOLS, ONLINE GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES, AND CONTINUED STRONG EXCLUSIVE CONTENT FROM OUR OWN GAME FRANCHISES AS WELL AS OTHER DIGITAL CONTENT OFFERINGS.

WINDOWS PHONE FACES COMPETITION PRIMARILY FROM APPLE, GOOGLE, AND BLACKBERRY. SKYPE COMPETES PRIMARILY WITH APPLE AND GOOGLE, WHICH OFFER A

SELECTION OF INSTANT MESSAGING, VOICE, AND VIDEO COMMUNICATION PRODUCTS.

WE COMPETE PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF PRODUCT QUALITY AND

VARIETY, UNIQUE CAPABILITIES OF OUR PRODUCTS, TIMING OF PRODUCT RELEASES, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING.

OPERATIONS

WE HAVE OPERATIONS CENTERS THAT SUPPORT ALL OPERATIONS IN THEIR REGIONS, INCLUDING CUSTOMER CONTRACT AND ORDER PROCESSING, CREDIT

AND COLLECTIONS, INFORMATION PROCESSING, AND VENDOR MANAGEMENT AND LOGISTICS. THE REGIONAL CENTER IN IRELAND SUPPORTS THE EUROPEAN, MIDDLE EASTERN, AND AFRICAN REGION; THE CENTER IN SINGAPORE SUPPORTS THE JAPAN, INDIA, GREATER CHINA, AND

ASIA-PACIFIC REGION; AND THE CENTERS IN FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA, FORT LAUDERDALE, FLORIDA, PUERTO RICO, REDMOND, WASHINGTON, AND RENO, NEVADA SUPPORT LATIN AMERICA AND NORTH AMERICA. IN ADDITION TO THE OPERATIONS CENTERS, WE ALSO OPERATE DATA CENTERS

THROUGHOUT THE AMERICAS, EUROPE, AND ASIA REGIONS.

TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD AND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND

USABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE LOCALIZE MANY OF OUR PRODUCTS TO REFLECT LOCAL LANGUAGES AND CONVENTIONS. LOCALIZING A PRODUCT MAY REQUIRE MODIFYING THE USER INTERFACE, ALTERING DIALOG BOXES, AND TRANSLATING TEXT.

WE CONTRACT MOST OF OUR MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES FOR XBOX 360 AND RELATED GAMES, KINECT FOR XBOX 360, VARIOUS RETAIL SOFTWARE PACKAGED PRODUCTS,

SURFACE DEVICES, AND MICROSOFT PC ACCESSORIES TO THIRD PARTIES. OUR PRODUCTS MAY INCLUDE SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE OR LIMITED SOURCES. OUR XBOX 360 CONSOLE, KINECT FOR XBOX 360, SURFACE DEVICES, AND MICROSOFT PC ACCESSORIES

INCLUDE KEY COMPONENTS THAT ARE SUPPLIED BY A SINGLE SOURCE. THE INTEGRATED CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT/GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT FOR THE XBOX 360 CONSOLE IS PURCHASED FROM IBM, AND THE SUPPORTING EMBEDDED DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY CHIPS ARE PURCHASED

FROM TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING COMPANY. WE GENERALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE OTHER MANUFACTURERS IF THE CURRENT VENDOR BECOMES UNAVAILABLE OR UNABLE TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS. WE GENERALLY HAVE MULTIPLE SOURCES FOR RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIES,

AND COMPONENTS, AND ARE OFTEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMPONENT PARTS AND MATERIALS ON A VOLUME DISCOUNT BASIS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

PRODUCT AND SERVICE DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

WE DEVELOP MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INTERNALLY. INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS US TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT COME FROM PRODUCT

DIFFERENTIATION AND CLOSER TECHNICAL CONTROL OVER OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IT ALSO GIVES US THE FREEDOM TO DECIDE WHICH MODIFICATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. WE STRIVE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION AS EARLY

AS POSSIBLE ABOUT CHANGING USAGE PATTERNS AND HARDWARE ADVANCES THAT MAY AFFECT SOFTWARE DESIGN. BEFORE RELEASING NEW SOFTWARE PLATFORMS, WE PROVIDE APPLICATION VENDORS WITH A RANGE OF RESOURCES AND GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, AND TESTING.

GENERALLY, WE ALSO CREATE PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION INTERNALLY.

WE PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INVESTMENTS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. WE

WORK ACTIVELY IN THE U.S. AND INTERNATIONALLY TO ENSURE THE ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, TRADE SECRET, AND OTHER PROTECTIONS THAT APPLY TO OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, BUSINESS PLANS, AND BRANDING. WE ARE A LEADER AMONG

TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN PURSUING PATENTS AND CURRENTLY HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF OVER 35,000 U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PATENTS ISSUED AND OVER 38,000 PENDING. WHILE WE EMPLOY MUCH OF OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EXCLUSIVELY IN MICROSOFT

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE ALSO ENGAGE IN OUTBOUND AND INBOUND LICENSING OF SPECIFIC PATENTED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE INCORPORATED INTO LICENSEES OR MICROSOFTS PRODUCTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO BROADER CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH

OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES COVERING ENTIRE GROUPS OF PATENTS. WE ALSO PURCHASE OR LICENSE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE INCORPORATE INTO OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. AT TIMES, WE MAKE SELECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BROADLY AVAILABLE AT NO OR LOW COST TO ACHIEVE A

STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE, SUCH AS PROMOTING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, ADVANCING INTEROPERABILITY, OR ATTRACTING AND ENABLING OUR EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY.

WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES

GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. WE BELIEVE OUR CONTINUING RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE LICENSE OR OTHER AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR

PRODUCTS.

INVESTING IN THE FUTURE

MICROSOFTS SUCCESS IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO CREATE NEW AND COMPELLING PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND EXPERIENCES FOR OUR USERS, TO INITIATE AND EMBRACE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, TO ENTER NEW GEOGRAPHIC AND

PRODUCT MARKETS, AND TO DRIVE BROAD ADOPTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE INVEST IN A RANGE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND BREAKTHROUGHS THAT WE BELIEVE OFFER SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND GROWTH FOR THE

COMPANY. WE MAINTAIN OUR LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACROSS A WIDE SPECTRUM OF TECHNOLOGIES, TOOLS, AND PLATFORMS SPANNING COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION, INFORMATION ACCESS AND ORGANIZATION, ENTERTAINMENT, BUSINESS AND

E-COMMERCE, ADVERTISING, AND DEVICES.

WHILE OUR MAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN REDMOND, WASHINGTON, WE ALSO

OPERATE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN OTHER PARTS OF THE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING CANADA, CHINA, DENMARK, ESTONIA, GERMANY, INDIA, IRELAND, ISRAEL, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THIS GLOBAL APPROACH HELPS US REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN

LOCAL MARKETS AND ENABLES US TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT TOP TALENT FROM ACROSS THE WORLD. WE GENERALLY FUND RESEARCH AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING BEYOND IMMEDIATE PRODUCT CONSIDERATIONS TO OPPORTUNITIES FURTHER IN THE FUTURE. WE

ALSO FUND RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AT THE BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL. MUCH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS COORDINATED WITH OTHER SEGMENTS AND LEVERAGED ACROSS THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION TO OUR MAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS, WE ALSO OPERATE MICROSOFT RESEARCH. MICROSOFT RESEARCH IS ONE OF THE WORLDS

LARGEST COMPUTER SCIENCE RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS, AND WORKS IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH TOP UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD TO ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, PROVIDING US A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON FUTURE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS.

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND OUR BROAD FOCUS ON LONG-TERM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WE SEE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO

DRIVE FUTURE GROWTH IN SMART CONNECTED DEVICES, CLOUD COMPUTING, ENTERTAINMENT, SEARCH, COMMUNICATIONS, AND PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH OUR DEVICES AND SERVICES STRATEGY.

DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING

WE MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRIMARILY THROUGH THE FOLLOWING CHANNELS: OEMS; DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS; AND ONLINE.

OEMS

WE DISTRIBUTE SOFTWARE

THROUGH OEMS THAT PRE-INSTALL OUR SOFTWARE ON NEW PCS, TABLETS, SERVERS, SMARTPHONES, AND OTHER INTELLIGENT DEVICES THAT THEY SELL TO END CUSTOMERS. THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE OEM BUSINESS IS THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM PRE-INSTALLED ON COMPUTING

DEVICES. OEMS ALSO SELL HARDWARE PRE-INSTALLED WITH OTHER MICROSOFT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SERVER AND EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS SUCH AS OUR MICROSOFT OFFICE SUITE. IN ADDITION TO THESE PRODUCTS, WE ALSO MARKET OUR SERVICES, SUCH AS

OUR WINDOWS SKYDRIVE SERVICE, THROUGH OEMS.

THERE ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF OEMS. THE LARGEST OEMS, MANY OF WHICH OPERATE GLOBALLY,

ARE REFERRED TO AS DIRECT OEMS, AS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM IS MANAGED THROUGH A DIRECT AGREEMENT BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND THE OEM. WE HAVE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS COVERING ONE OR MORE OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE

MULTINATIONAL OEMS, INCLUDING ACER, ASUS, DELL, FUJITSU, HTC, HEWLETT-PACKARD, LG, LENOVO, NOKIA, SAMSUNG, SONY, TOSHIBA, AND WITH MANY REGIONAL AND LOCAL OEMS. THE SECOND BROAD CATEGORY OF OEMS CONSISTS OF LOWER-VOLUME PC MANUFACTURERS (ALSO CALLED

SYSTEM BUILDERS), WHICH SOURCE THEIR MICROSOFT SOFTWARE FOR PRE-INSTALLATION AND LOCAL REDISTRIBUTION PRIMARILY THROUGH THE MICROSOFT DISTRIBUTOR CHANNEL RATHER THAN THROUGH A DIRECT AGREEMENT OR RELATIONSHIP WITH MICROSOFT.

DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS

MANY

ORGANIZATIONS THAT LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS TRANSACT DIRECTLY WITH US, WITH SALES SUPPORT FROM SOLUTION INTEGRATORS, INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS, WEB AGENCIES, AND DEVELOPERS THAT ADVISE ORGANIZATIONS ON

LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISORS). ORGANIZATIONS ALSO LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INDIRECTLY, PRIMARILY THROUGH LARGE ACCOUNT RESELLERS (LARS), DISTRIBUTORS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS

(VARS), OEMS, SYSTEM BUILDER CHANNELS, AND RETAILERS. ALTHOUGH EACH TYPE OF RESELLING PARTNER REACHES ORGANIZATIONS OF ALL SIZES, LARS ARE PRIMARILY ENGAGED WITH LARGE ORGANIZATIONS, DISTRIBUTORS RESELL PRIMARILY TO VARS, AND VARS

TYPICALLY REACH SMALL-SIZED AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS. ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISORS TYPICALLY ARE ALSO AUTHORIZED AS LARS AND OPERATE AS RESELLERS FOR OUR OTHER LICENSING PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE SELECT PLUS AND OPEN LICENSING PROGRAMS DISCUSSED

UNDER LICENSING OPTIONS BELOW. SOME OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS INCLUDE INGRAM MICRO AND TECH DATA, AND SOME OF OUR LARGEST RESELLERS INCLUDE CDW, DELL, INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, AND SOFTWARE HOUSE INTERNATIONAL.

OUR MICROSOFT DYNAMICS SOFTWARE OFFERINGS ARE LICENSED TO ENTERPRISES THROUGH A GLOBAL NETWORK OF CHANNEL PARTNERS PROVIDING VERTICAL SOLUTIONS AND

SPECIALIZED SERVICES. WE DISTRIBUTE OUR RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT NON-EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORS, AUTHORIZED REPLICATORS, RESELLERS, AND RETAIL OUTLETS. INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS OBTAIN THESE PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH RETAIL

OUTLETS, SUCH AS WAL-MART, DIXONS, AND MICROSOFT STORES. WE DISTRIBUTE OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SURFACE, XBOX, AND PC ACCESSORIES, THROUGH THIRD-PARTY RETAILERS AND MICROSOFT STORES. WE HAVE A NETWORK OF FIELD SALES REPRESENTATIVES AND FIELD

SUPPORT PERSONNEL THAT SOLICITS ORDERS FROM DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS, AND PROVIDES PRODUCT TRAINING AND SALES SUPPORT.

ONLINE

ALTHOUGH CLIENT-BASED SOFTWARE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS, INCREASINGLY WE ARE DELIVERING ADDITIONAL VALUE TO CUSTOMERS

THROUGH CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. WE PROVIDE ONLINE CONTENT AND SERVICES TO CONSUMERS THROUGH BING, MSN PORTALS AND CHANNELS, MICROSOFT OFFICE WEB APPS, OFFICE 365, WINDOWS PHONE MARKETPLACE, XBOX LIVE, OUTLOOK.COM, SKYPE, AND WINDOWS STORE. WE ALSO

PROVIDE TO BUSINESS USERS COMMERCIAL CLOUD-BASED SERVICES SUCH AS EXCHANGE ONLINE, MICROSOFT DYNAMICS CRM ONLINE, WINDOWS AZURE, WINDOWS INTUNE, AND OFFICE 365 CONSISTING OF ONLINE VERSIONS OF OFFICE, EXCHANGE, SHAREPOINT, LYNC, AND YAMMER. OTHER

SERVICES DELIVERED

AND ONLINE TECHNICAL AND PRACTICE READINESS RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR PARTNERS IN DEVELOPING AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS. AS WE INCREASINGLY DELIVER ONLINE SERVICES, WE SELL MANY OF THESE CLOUD-BASED SERVICES THROUGH OUR ENTERPRISE

AGREEMENTS AND HAVE ALSO ENABLED NEW SALES PROGRAMS TO REACH SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES. THESE NEW PROGRAMS INCLUDE DIRECT SALES, DIRECT SALES SUPPORTED BY A LARGE NETWORK OF PARTNER ADVISORS, AND RESALES OF SERVICES THROUGH OPERATOR

CHANNELS, SUCH AS TELEPHONE, CELL, AND CABLE PROVIDERS. WE ALSO SELL OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH OUR ONLINE STORE, MICROSOFTSTORE.COM.

LICENSING OPTIONS

WE

LICENSE SOFTWARE TO ORGANIZATIONS UNDER ARRANGEMENTS THAT ALLOW THE END-USER CUSTOMER TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO

PROVIDE THEM WITH A MEANS OF DOING SO WITHOUT HAVING TO ACQUIRE SEPARATE PACKAGED PRODUCT THROUGH RETAIL CHANNELS. IN DELIVERING ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS TO THE MARKET, WE USE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR

ORGANIZATIONS OF VARIOUS SIZES. WHILE THESE PROGRAMS MAY DIFFER IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD, GENERALLY THEY INCLUDE THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW.

OPEN

LICENSING

DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR SMALL-TO-MEDIUM ORGANIZATIONS, OPEN PROGRAMS ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL OR SUBSCRIPTION

LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (TWO OR THREE YEARS DEPENDING ON THE OPEN PROGRAMS USED). THE OFFERING THAT CONVEYS RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF CERTAIN

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD IS CALLED SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. SOFTWARE ASSURANCE ALSO PROVIDES SUPPORT, TOOLS, AND TRAINING TO HELP CUSTOMERS DEPLOY AND USE SOFTWARE EFFICIENTLY. OPEN PROGRAMS HAS SEVERAL VARIATIONS TO FIT CUSTOMERS

DIVERSE WAY OF PURCHASING. UNDER THE OPEN LICENSE PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS CAN ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY OR LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. THEY CAN ALSO RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS.

SELECT PLUS LICENSING

DESIGNED PRIMARILY

FOR MEDIUM-TO-LARGE ORGANIZATIONS, THE SELECT PLUS PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, SOFTWARE ASSURANCE OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY THREE YEARS OR LESS). SIMILAR TO OPEN

PROGRAMS, THE SELECT PLUS PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY, ACQUIRE LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, OR RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS. ONLINE SERVICES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR

PURCHASE THROUGH THE SELECT PLUS PROGRAM, AND SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED WITH TERMS BETWEEN ONE AND THREE YEARS.

PARTNER LICENSING

THE MICROSOFT SERVICES PROVIDER LICENSE AGREEMENT IS A PROGRAM TARGETED AT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS

ALLOWING THESE PARTNERS TO PROVIDE SOFTWARE SERVICES AND HOSTED APPLICATIONS TO THEIR END CUSTOMERS. AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED WITH A THREE-YEAR TERM, AND PARTNERS ARE BILLED MONTHLY BASED UPON CONSUMPTION. MICROSOFT ONLINE SERVICES

RESELLER AGREEMENT IS A PROGRAM ENABLING PARTNERS TO PACKAGE MICROSOFT ONLINE SERVICES WITH THE PARTNERS SERVICES. MICROSOFT ONLINE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT IS DESIGNED TO ENABLE SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES TO EASILY PURCHASE MICROSOFT

ONLINE SERVICES. THE PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE MONTHLY OR ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. WINDOWS AZURE AGREEMENT IS DESIGNED TO ENABLE SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES TO PURCHASE WINDOWS AZURE SUBSCRIPTION PLANS ON A

PAY-AS-YOU-GO BASIS.

ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT LICENSING

ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS ARE TARGETED AT MEDIUM- AND LARGE-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS THAT WANT TO ACQUIRE LICENSES TO ONLINE SERVICES AND/OR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, ALONG WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, FOR ALL OR SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF

THEIR ENTERPRISE.

CUSTOMERS

OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS, SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS,

ENTERPRISES, GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, APPLICATION DEVELOPERS, AND OEMS. CONSUMERS AND SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS OBTAIN OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS, AND

OEMS. NO SALES TO AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF FISCAL YEAR 2013, 2012, OR 2011 REVENUE. OUR PRACTICE IS TO SHIP OUR PRODUCTS PROMPTLY UPON RECEIPT OF PURCHASE ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS; CONSEQUENTLY, BACKLOG IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION ACROSS

ALL MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH MAY LEAD TO LOWER REVENUE OR OPERATING MARGINS.

COMPETITION IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR

OUR COMPETITORS RANGE IN SIZE FROM DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL COMPANIES WITH SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO SMALL,

SPECIALIZED FIRMS WHOSE NARROWER PRODUCT LINES MAY LET THEM BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEPLOYING TECHNICAL, MARKETING, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN OUR BUSINESSES GENERALLY ARE LOW AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS CAN BE DISTRIBUTED BROADLY AND

QUICKLY AT RELATIVELY LOW COST. MANY OF THE AREAS IN WHICH WE COMPETE EVOLVE RAPIDLY WITH CHANGING AND DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, SHIFTING USER NEEDS, AND FREQUENT INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE DEPENDS

ON OUR SUCCESS IN MAKING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, DEVICES, AND SERVICES THAT APPEAL TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS.

COMPETITION AMONG PLATFORMS,

ECOSYSTEMS, AND DEVICES

AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN TO CREATE PLATFORM-BASED ECOSYSTEMS ON WHICH MANY

PARTICIPANTS CAN BUILD DIVERSE SOLUTIONS. A WELL-ESTABLISHED ECOSYSTEM CREATES BENEFICIAL NETWORK EFFECTS AMONG USERS, APPLICATION DEVELOPERS, AND THE PLATFORM PROVIDER THAT CAN ACCELERATE GROWTH. ESTABLISHING SIGNIFICANT SCALE IN THE MARKETPLACE IS

NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN ATTRACTIVE MARGINS. THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING A VIBRANT ECOSYSTEM INCREASED WITH THE LAUNCH OF THE WINDOWS 8 OPERATING SYSTEM, SURFACE, WINDOWS PHONE, AND ASSOCIATED CLOUD-BASED

SERVICES. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM FIRMS THAT PROVIDE COMPETING PLATFORMS, APPLICATIONS, AND SERVICES.



A COMPETING VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED MODEL, IN WHICH A SINGLE FIRM CONTROLS THE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ELEMENTS OF A PRODUCT AND RELATED SERVICES, HAS BEEN

SUCCESSFUL WITH SOME CONSUMER PRODUCTS SUCH AS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, TABLETS, MOBILE PHONES, GAMING CONSOLES, AND DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS. COMPETITORS PURSUING THIS MODEL ALSO EARN REVENUE FROM SERVICES THAT ARE INTEGRATED WITH THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE

PLATFORM. WE ALSO OFFER SOME VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; HOWEVER, OUR COMPETITORS IN SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS HAVE ESTABLISHED SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER USER BASES. EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH THE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED

MODEL WILL INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE AND REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.



WE DERIVE SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE FROM LICENSES OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS ON PERSONAL COMPUTERS. WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITIVE CHALLENGES FROM COMPETING

PLATFORMS DEVELOPED FOR NEW DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS SUCH AS SMARTPHONES AND TABLET COMPUTERS. THESE DEVICES COMPETE ON MULTIPLE BASES INCLUDING PRICE AND THE PERCEIVED UTILITY OF THE DEVICE AND ITS PLATFORM. USERS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO THESE

DEVICES TO PERFORM FUNCTIONS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN PERFORMED BY PERSONAL COMPUTERS IN THE PAST. EVEN IF MANY USERS VIEW THESE DEVICES AS COMPLEMENTARY TO A PERSONAL COMPUTER, THE PREVALENCE OF THESE DEVICES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT

APPLICATIONS DEVELOPERS TO OUR PLATFORMS. IN ADDITION, SURFACE COMPETES WITH PRODUCTS MADE BY OUR OEM PARTNERS, WHICH MAY AFFECT THEIR COMMITMENT TO OUR PLATFORM.



COMPETING PLATFORMS HAVE APPLICATIONS MARKETPLACES (SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS STORES) WITH SCALE AND SIGNIFICANT INSTALLED BASES ON MOBILE DEVICES.

THESE APPLICATIONS LEVERAGE FREE AND USER-PAID SERVICES THAT OVER TIME RESULT IN DISINCENTIVES FOR USERS TO SWITCH TO COMPETING PLATFORMS. IN ORDER TO COMPETE, WE MUST SUCCESSFULLY ENLIST DEVELOPERS TO WRITE APPLICATIONS FOR OUR MARKETPLACE AND

ENSURE THAT THESE APPLICATIONS HAVE HIGH QUALITY, CUSTOMER APPEAL, AND VALUE. EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH THESE APPLICATION MARKETPLACES MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE AND LOWER OUR OPERATING MARGINS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A

BUSINESS MODEL COMPETITION

COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US BASED ON A GROWING VARIETY OF BUSINESS MODELS.



UNDER THE LICENSE-BASED PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE MODEL THAT GENERATES MOST OF OUR REVENUE, WE BEAR THE COSTS OF CONVERTING ORIGINAL IDEAS INTO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS

THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OFFSETTING THESE COSTS WITH THE REVENUE RECEIVED FROM LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS ALSO DEVELOP AND SELL SOFTWARE TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS UNDER THIS MODEL AND WE EXPECT THIS

COMPETITION TO CONTINUE.



OTHER COMPETITORS DEVELOP AND OFFER FREE APPLICATIONS, ONLINE SERVICES AND CONTENT, AND MAKE MONEY BY SELLING THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING. ADVERTISING REVENUE

FUNDS DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THESE COMPETITORS PROVIDE TO USERS AT NO OR LITTLE COST, COMPETING DIRECTLY WITH OUR REVENUE-GENERATING PRODUCTS.



SOME COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US USING AN OPEN SOURCE BUSINESS MODEL BY MODIFYING AND THEN DISTRIBUTING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AT NOMINAL COST TO END-USERS AND

EARNING REVENUE ON ADVERTISING OR COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. THESE FIRMS DO NOT BEAR THE FULL COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE SOFTWARE. SOME OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE VENDORS DEVELOP SOFTWARE THAT MIMICS THE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY

OF OUR PRODUCTS.

THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY RESULT IN DECREASED SALES VOLUMES, PRICE REDUCTIONS,

AND/OR INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, SUCH AS FOR MARKETING AND SALES INCENTIVES. THIS MAY LEAD TO LOWER REVENUE, GROSS MARGINS, AND OPERATING INCOME.

OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON SERVICES PRESENTS EXECUTION AND COMPETITIVE RISKS.

A GROWING PART OF OUR STRATEGY INVOLVES CLOUD-BASED SERVICES USED WITH SMART DEVICES. OUR COMPETITORS ARE

RAPIDLY DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. PRICING AND DELIVERY MODELS ARE EVOLVING. DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS INFLUENCE HOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD AND IN SOME CASES THE USERS CHOICE

OF WHICH SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO USE. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY OUR OWN COMPETING CLOUD-BASED STRATEGIES. THE WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM MUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE WITH THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. WHILE WE BELIEVE OUR

EXPERTISE, INVESTMENTS IN INFRASTRUCTURE, AND THE BREADTH OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES PROVIDE US WITH A STRONG FOUNDATION TO COMPETE, IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER OUR STRATEGIES WILL ATTRACT THE USERS OR GENERATE THE REVENUE REQUIRED TO BE SUCCESSFUL. IN

ADDITION TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS, WE ARE INCURRING COSTS TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES. THESE COSTS MAY REDUCE THE OPERATING MARGINS WE HAVE PREVIOUSLY ACHIEVED. WHETHER WE ARE SUCCESSFUL IN THIS NEW

BUSINESS MODEL DEPENDS ON OUR EXECUTION IN A NUMBER OF AREAS, INCLUDING.



CONTINUING TO BRING TO MARKET COMPELLING CLOUD-BASED EXPERIENCES THAT GENERATE INCREASING TRAFFIC AND MARKET SHARE;



MAINTAINING THE UTILITY, COMPATIBILITY, AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ON THE GROWING ARRAY OF COMPUTING DEVICES, INCLUDING PCS, SMARTPHONES,

TABLETS, AND TELEVISION-RELATED DEVICES;



CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR CLOUD PLATFORMS TO THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS; AND



ENSURING THAT OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES MEET THE RELIABILITY EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF THEIR DATA.

IN JULY 2013, WE ANNOUNCED A CHANGE IN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AS PART OF OUR TRANSFORMATION TO A DEVICES AND

SERVICES COMPANY. THIS CHANGE IN STRUCTURE IS DESIGNED TO ENABLE US TO INNOVATE WITH GREATER SPEED, EFFICIENCY, AND CAPABILITY IN THE FAST-CHANGING COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT. WE EXPECT THIS CHANGE TO ALTER THE WAY WE PLAN, DEVELOP, AND MARKET OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AS WE PURSUE A SINGLE STRATEGY TO OFFER A FAMILY OF DEVICES AND SERVICES DESIGNED TO EMPOWER OUR CUSTOMERS FOR THE ACTIVITIES THEY VALUE MOST. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER OUR ONE MICROSOFT STRATEGY WILL YIELD THE

ANTICIPATED EFFICIENCIES OR COMPETITIVE BENEFITS.

AS WE INCREASINGLY LICENSE CLOUD-BASED VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, SUCH AS

OFFICE 365, RATHER THAN LICENSING TRANSACTION-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE ASSOCIATED REVENUE WILL SHIFT FROM BEING RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION TO BEING RECOGNIZED OVER THE PERIOD OF THE SUBSCRIPTION.

ITEM 1A

WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT MAY NOT BE

PROFITABLE.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM, THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM,

BING, WINDOWS PHONE, WINDOWS SERVER, THE WINDOWS STORE, THE WINDOWS AZURE SERVICES PLATFORM, OFFICE 365, OTHER CLOUD-BASED SERVICES OFFERINGS, AND THE XBOX 360 ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN NEW SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS,

SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, SUCH AS THE MICROSOFT-DESIGNED AND MANUFACTURED SURFACE LAUNCHED IN OCTOBER 2012. INVESTMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGY ARE SPECULATIVE. COMMERCIAL SUCCESS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING INNOVATIVENESS, DEVELOPER SUPPORT, AND

EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING. IF CUSTOMERS DO NOT PERCEIVE OUR LATEST OFFERINGS AS PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNCTIONALITY OR OTHER VALUE, THEY MAY REDUCE THEIR PURCHASES OF NEW SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES, UNFAVORABLY IMPACTING REVENUE.

WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM NEW PRODUCT, SERVICE, AND DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL INVESTMENTS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, IF AT ALL. MOREOVER, NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE, AND EVEN IF THEY ARE PROFITABLE, OPERATING MARGINS

FOR SOME NEW PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES WILL NOT BE AS HIGH AS THE MARGINS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORICALLY.

IN OCTOBER 2012, WE LAUNCHED

WINDOWS 8, A MAJOR NEW RELEASE OF OUR OPERATING SYSTEM, WHICH SEEKS TO DELIVER A UNIQUE USER EXPERIENCE THROUGH WELL-INTEGRATED SOFTWARE, HARDWARE, AND SERVICES. ITS SUCCESS DEPENDS ON A NUMBER OF FACTORS INCLUDING THE EXTENT TO WHICH CUSTOMERS

EMBRACE THE NEW USER INTERFACE AND FUNCTIONALITY, SUCCESSFULLY COORDINATING WITH OUR OEM PARTNERS IN RELEASING A VARIETY OF HARDWARE DEVICES THAT TAKE ADVANTAGE OF NEW FEATURES, PRICING WINDOWS 8-BASED DEVICES COMPETITIVELY, AND ATTRACTING

DEVELOPERS AT SCALE TO ENSURE A COMPETITIVE ARRAY OF QUALITY APPLICATIONS. THE MARKETING COSTS WE ARE INCURRING TO PROMOTE WINDOWS 8 AND ASSOCIATED SERVICES AND DEVICES MAY REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.

ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE EXPECT TO

CONTINUE MAKING ACQUISITIONS OR ENTERING INTO JOINT VENTURES AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AS PART OF OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS STRATEGY. THESE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS INCLUDING THAT THE TRANSACTION DOES NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS

STRATEGY, THAT WE DO NOT REALIZE A SATISFACTORY RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT, THAT WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY, OR THAT THE TRANSACTION DIVERTS MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM OUR OTHER

BUSINESSES. OUR ACQUISITION OF SKYPE, FOR EXAMPLE, PROVIDES OPPORTUNITIES TO ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS. THE SUCCESS OF THIS ACQUISITION WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE COMPELLING EXPERIENCES THAT DISTINGUISH US FROM OUR COMPETITORS

IN BOTH CONSUMER AND BUSINESS MARKETS. IT MAY TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE FULL BENEFITS FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS INCREASED REVENUE, ENHANCED EFFICIENCIES, OR INCREASED MARKET SHARE, OR THE BENEFITS MAY ULTIMATELY BE SMALLER THAN

ANTICIPATED OR MAY NOT BE REALIZED. THESE EVENTS COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

PROTECTING OUR GLOBAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND COMBATING UNLICENSED COPYING AND USE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DIFFICULT. WHILE PIRACY

ADVERSELY AFFECTS U.S. REVENUE, THE IMPACT ON REVENUE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS MORE SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE LAWS ARE LESS PROTECTIVE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. AS A RESULT, OUR REVENUE IN THESE MARKETS MAY GROW SLOWER THAN

THE UNDERLYING PC MARKET. SIMILARLY, THE ABSENCE OF HARMONIZED PATENT LAWS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENSURE CONSISTENT RESPECT FOR PATENT RIGHTS. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WE ACTIVELY EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF LICENSING GENUINE PRODUCTS

AND OBTAINING INDEMNIFICATION BENEFITS FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS, AND WE EDUCATE LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF A BUSINESS CLIMATE WHERE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. HOWEVER, CONTINUED EDUCATIONAL AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS MAY

FAIL TO ENHANCE REVENUE. REDUCTIONS IN THE LEGAL PROTECTION FOR SOFTWARE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUE.

THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, WE RECEIVE NOTICES FROM

OTHERS CLAIMING WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE NUMBER OF THESE CLAIMS MAY GROW BECAUSE OF CONSTANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE COMPETE, THE EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES, THE RAPID RATE

OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, AND OUR OFFERING OF MICROSOFT-BRANDED SERVICES AND HARDWARE DEVICES, SUCH AS SURFACE. TO RESOLVE THESE CLAIMS WE MAY ENTER INTO ROYALTY AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN CURRENTLY AVAILABLE,

STOP SELLING OR REDESIGN AFFECTED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR PAY DAMAGES TO SATISFY INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE OUTCOMES MAY CAUSE OPERATING MARGINS TO DECLINE. IN ADDITION TO MONEY DAMAGES, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS PLAINTIFFS

CAN SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT MAY LIMIT OR PREVENT IMPORTING, MARKETING, AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES THAT HAVE INFRINGING TECHNOLOGIES. IN SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 1A

AS GERMANY, AN INJUNCTION CAN BE ISSUED BEFORE THE PARTIES HAVE FULLY LITIGATED THE VALIDITY OF THE UNDERLYING PATENTS. WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE MAKING SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES TO

SETTLE CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND TO PROCURE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO MANAGE THIS RISK.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR SOURCE CODE FROM COPYING IF THERE IS AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE CODE.

SOURCE CODE, THE DETAILED PROGRAM COMMANDS FOR OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS

AND OTHER SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH WE LICENSE PORTIONS OF OUR APPLICATION AND OPERATING SYSTEM SOURCE CODE TO A NUMBER OF LICENSEES, WE TAKE SIGNIFICANT MEASURES TO PROTECT THE SECRECY OF LARGE PORTIONS OF OUR SOURCE

CODE. IF AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SOURCE CODE OCCURS, WE COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE FUTURE TRADE SECRET PROTECTION FOR THAT SOURCE CODE. IT MAY BECOME EASIER FOR THIRD PARTIES TO COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS BY COPYING

FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE CODE ALSO COULD INCREASE THE SECURITY RISKS DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

CYBER-ATTACKS AND SECURITY VULNERABILITIES COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUE, INCREASED COSTS, LIABILITY CLAIMS, OR HARM TO OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

SECURITY OF MICROSOFTS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF COMPUTERS AND

COMPUTER NETWORKS IS PARAMOUNT FOR US AND OUR CUSTOMERS. THREATS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SECURITY CAN TAKE A VARIETY OF FORMS. HACKERS DEVELOP AND DEPLOY VIRUSES, WORMS, AND OTHER MALICIOUS SOFTWARE PROGRAMS THAT ATTACK OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORKS AND DATA CENTERS. GROUPS OF HACKERS MAY ALSO ACT IN A COORDINATED MANNER TO LAUNCH DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF SERVICE ATTACKS, OR OTHER COORDINATED ATTACKS. SOPHISTICATED ORGANIZATIONS, INDIVIDUALS,

OR GOVERNMENTS LAUNCH TARGETED ATTACKS TO GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORK. BREACHES OF OUR NETWORK OR DATA SECURITY COULD DISRUPT AND COMPROMISE THE SECURITY OF OUR INTERNAL SYSTEMS AND BUSINESS APPLICATIONS, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR

CUSTOMERS AND PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THEIR DATA, RESULT IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DELAYS, COMPROMISE CONFIDENTIAL OR TECHNICAL BUSINESS INFORMATION HARMING OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULT IN THEFT OR MISUSE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY, OR OTHERWISE

ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION, OUR INTERNAL IT ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. OFTEN WE ARE EARLY ADOPTERS OF NEW DEVICES

AND TECHNOLOGIES. WE EMBRACE NEW WAYS OF SHARING DATA AND COMMUNICATING INTERNALLY AND WITH PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS USING METHODS SUCH AS SOCIAL NETWORKING AND OTHER CONSUMER-ORIENTED TECHNOLOGIES. THESE PRACTICES CAN ENHANCE EFFICIENCY AND BUSINESS

INSIGHT, BUT THEY ALSO PRESENT RISKS THAT OUR BUSINESS POLICIES AND INTERNAL SECURITY CONTROLS MAY NOT KEEP PACE WITH THE SPEED OF THESE CHANGES.

SECURITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

SECURITY THREATS ARE A PARTICULAR CHALLENGE TO COMPANIES LIKE US WHOSE BUSINESS IS TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THE THREATS TO OUR OWN IT INFRASTRUCTURE ALSO AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS USING OUR

CLOUD-BASED SERVICES RELY ON THE SECURITY OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO ENSURE THE RELIABILITY OF OUR SERVICES AND THE PROTECTION OF THEIR DATA. HACKERS TEND TO FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON THE MOST POPULAR OPERATING SYSTEMS, PROGRAMS, AND SERVICES, INCLUDING

MANY OF OURS, AND WE EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO SO. THE SECURITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS AN IMPORTANT CONSIDERATION IN OUR CUSTOMERS PURCHASING DECISIONS.

WE DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEFEND AGAINST SECURITY THREATS, BOTH TO OUR INTERNAL IT SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE INCLUDE.



ENGINEERING MORE SECURE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;



ENHANCING SECURITY AND RELIABILITY FEATURES IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND CONTINUOUSLY EVALUATING AND UPDATING THOSE SECURITY AND RELIABILITY FEATURES;



IMPROVING THE DEPLOYMENT OF SOFTWARE UPDATES TO ADDRESS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES;



INVESTING IN MITIGATION TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP TO SECURE CUSTOMERS FROM ATTACKS EVEN WHEN SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE NOT DEPLOYED;



PROTECTING THE DIGITAL SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT ENSURES THE INTEGRITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES;



HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS MAKE THE BEST USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO PROTECT AGAINST COMPUTER VIRUSES AND OTHER ATTACKS; AND



PROVIDING CUSTOMERS ONLINE AUTOMATED SECURITY TOOLS, PUBLISHED SECURITY GUIDANCE, AND SECURITY SOFTWARE SUCH AS FIREWALLS AND ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE.

THE COST OF THESE STEPS COULD REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED SECURITY

VULNERABILITIES IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD CAUSE SIGNIFICANT REPUTATIONAL HARM AND LEAD SOME CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE OR DELAY FUTURE PURCHASES OF PRODUCTS OR SUBSCRIPTIONS TO SERVICES, OR TO USE COMPETING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO

INCREASE THEIR EXPENDITURES ON PROTECTING THEIR EXISTING COMPUTER SYSTEMS FROM ATTACK, WHICH COULD DELAY ADOPTION OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. ANY OF THESE ACTIONS BY CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED

VULNERABILITIES MAY LEAD TO CLAIMS AGAINST US. ALTHOUGH OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE OR LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO SUCH LIABILITY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THESE PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND LEGAL CHALLENGES. LEGISLATIVE

OR REGULATORY ACTION MAY INCREASE THE COSTS TO DEVELOP OR IMPLEMENT OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA

COULD RESULT IN LIABILITY AND HARM OUR REPUTATION.

AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW THE NUMBER AND SCALE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED OFFERINGS, WE STORE AND PROCESS INCREASINGLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF OUR

CUSTOMERS. AT THE SAME TIME, THE CONTINUED OCCURRENCE OF HIGH-PROFILE DATA BREACHES PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF AN EXTERNAL ENVIRONMENT INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO INFORMATION SECURITY. THIS ENVIRONMENT DEMANDS THAT WE CONTINUOUSLY IMPROVE OUR DESIGN AND

COORDINATION OF SECURITY CONTROLS ACROSS OUR BUSINESS GROUPS AND GEOGRAPHIES. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, IT IS POSSIBLE OUR SECURITY CONTROLS OVER PERSONAL DATA, OUR TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES AND VENDORS ON DATA SECURITY, AND OTHER PRACTICES WE FOLLOW MAY

NOT PREVENT THE IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION THAT WE OR OUR VENDORS STORE AND MANAGE. IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF THIS INFORMATION COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION, LEAD TO LEGAL EXPOSURE TO CUSTOMERS, OR SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY

UNDER LAWS THAT PROTECT PERSONAL DATA, RESULTING IN INCREASED COSTS OR LOSS OF REVENUE. OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALSO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO STORE AND PROCESS PERSONAL DATA ON PREMISE OR, INCREASINGLY, IN A CLOUD-BASED ENVIRONMENT WE

HOST. WE BELIEVE CONSUMERS USING OUR EMAIL, MESSAGING, STORAGE, SHARING, AND SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICES WILL INCREASINGLY WANT EFFICIENT, CENTRALIZED METHODS OF CHOOSING THEIR PRIVACY PREFERENCES AND CONTROLLING THEIR DATA. PERCEPTIONS THAT OUR

PRODUCTS OR SERVICES DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COULD INHIBIT SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND COULD CONSTRAIN CONSUMER AND BUSINESS ADOPTION OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS.

WE MAY EXPERIENCE OUTAGES, DATA LOSSES, AND DISRUPTIONS OF OUR ONLINE SERVICES IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE OPERATIONS

INFRASTRUCTURE.

OUR INCREASING USER TRAFFIC AND THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DEMAND MORE COMPUTING POWER. WE HAVE SPENT AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS TO PURCHASE OR LEASE DATA CENTERS

AND EQUIPMENT AND TO UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TO HANDLE MORE TRAFFIC ON OUR WEBSITES AND IN OUR DATA CENTERS, AND TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND SUPPORT EXISTING SERVICES SUCH AS BING, EXCHANGE ONLINE, OFFICE

365, SHAREPOINT ONLINE, SKYDRIVE, SKYPE, XBOX LIVE, WINDOWS AZURE, OUTLOOK.COM, AND MICROSOFT OFFICE WEB APPS. WE ALSO ARE GROWING OUR BUSINESS OF PROVIDING A PLATFORM AND BACK-END HOSTING FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTY BUSINESSES TO THEIR END

CUSTOMERS. MAINTAINING AND EXPANDING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS EXPENSIVE AND COMPLEX. INEFFICIENCIES OR OPERATIONAL FAILURES, INCLUDING TEMPORARY OR PERMANENT LOSS OF CUSTOMER DATA, COULD DIMINISH THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND USER

EXPERIENCE RESULTING IN CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY, CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND LOSS OF CURRENT AND POTENTIAL USERS, SUBSCRIBERS, AND ADVERTISERS, EACH OF WHICH MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIVITY THAT MAY LIMIT HOW WE DESIGN AND MARKET OUR

PRODUCTS.

AS A LEADING GLOBAL SOFTWARE MAKER, WE ARE CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES UNDER U.S. AND FOREIGN COMPETITION LAWS. SOME JURISDICTIONS ALSO PROVIDE PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION FOR COMPETITORS OR CONSUMERS

TO ASSERT CLAIMS OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE WERE SUED ON COMPETITION LAW GROUNDS BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 18 STATES, AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN THE LATE 1990S. THE RESOLUTION OF THE GOVERNMENT LAWSUITS IMPOSED

VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS ON OUR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM BUSINESSES. ALTHOUGH THESE CONSTRAINTS EXPIRED IN MAY 2011, WE EXPECT THAT FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST AUTHORITIES WILL CONTINUE TO CLOSELY SCRUTINIZE OUR BUSINESS.

PART I

ITEM 1A

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION CLOSELY SCRUTINIZES THE DESIGN OF HIGH-VOLUME MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND THE

TERMS ON WHICH WE MAKE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES USED IN THESE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS FILE FORMATS, PROGRAMMING INTERFACES, AND PROTOCOLS, AVAILABLE TO OTHER COMPANIES. IN 2004, THE COMMISSION ORDERED US TO CREATE NEW VERSIONS OF WINDOWS THAT DO NOT INCLUDE

CERTAIN MULTIMEDIA TECHNOLOGIES AND TO PROVIDE OUR COMPETITORS WITH SPECIFICATIONS FOR HOW TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN PROPRIETARY WINDOWS COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS IN THEIR OWN PRODUCTS. IN 2009, THE COMMISSION ACCEPTED A SET OF COMMITMENTS OFFERED BY

MICROSOFT TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSIONS CONCERNS RELATING TO COMPETITION IN WEB BROWSING SOFTWARE, INCLUDING AN UNDERTAKING TO ADDRESS COMMISSION CONCERNS RELATING TO INTEROPERABILITY. THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO INNOVATE IN

WINDOWS OR OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE, DIMINISH THE DEVELOPER APPEAL OF THE WINDOWS PLATFORM, AND INCREASE OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. THE AVAILABILITY OF LICENSES RELATED TO PROTOCOLS AND FILE FORMATS MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE

PRODUCTS THAT BETTER MIMIC THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS WHICH COULD HAMPER SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATORY

ACTIONS AND COURT DECISIONS SUCH AS THESE MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE BENEFITS OF OUR SOFTWARE TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, THEREBY REDUCING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE REVENUE THAT COME FROM THEM. NEW COMPETITION LAW

ACTIONS COULD BE INITIATED AT ANY TIME. THE OUTCOME OF SUCH ACTIONS, OR STEPS TAKEN TO AVOID THEM, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING.



WE MAY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WITHDRAWING PRODUCTS FROM CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES TO AVOID FINES OR DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS OF THOSE PRODUCTS

TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT RULINGS, WHICH MAY ENTAIL A DELAY IN A PRODUCT RELEASE AND REMOVING FUNCTIONALITY THAT CUSTOMERS WANT OR ON WHICH DEVELOPERS RELY.



WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE AVAILABLE LICENSES TO OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES ON TERMS THAT DO NOT REFLECT THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE OR DO NOT PROTECT OUR

ASSOCIATED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.



THE RULINGS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY BE USED AS PRECEDENT IN OTHER COMPETITION LAW PROCEEDINGS.



WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF ONGOING COMMITMENTS AS A RESULT OF COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS, CONSENT DECREES OR OTHER VOLUNTARY ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN. IF

WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESE COMMITMENTS WE MAY INCUR LITIGATION COSTS AND BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL FINES OR OTHER REMEDIAL ACTIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN JULY 2012, WE ANNOUNCED THAT, FOR SOME PCS SOLD IN EUROPE, WE WERE NOT IN COMPLIANCE WITH OUR 2009

AGREEMENT TO DISPLAY A BROWSER CHOICE SCREEN ON WINDOWS PCS WHERE INTERNET EXPLORER IS THE DEFAULT BROWSER. AS A RESULT, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION IMPOSED A FINE OF



561 MILLION (APPROXIMATELY $733 MILLION).

OUR PRODUCTS AND ONLINE

SERVICES OFFERINGS, INCLUDING NEW TECHNOLOGIES WE DEVELOP OR ACQUIRE SUCH AS SKYPE, ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION IN SOME JURISDICTIONS, INCLUDING IN AREAS OF USER PRIVACY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, DATA PROTECTION, AND ONLINE CONTENT. THE

APPLICATION OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO OUR BUSINESS IS OFTEN UNCLEAR, SUBJECT TO CHANGE OVER TIME, AND SOMETIMES MAY CONFLICT FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ADDITIONALLY THESE LAWS AND GOVERNMENTS APPROACH TO THEIR ENFORCEMENT, AS

WELL AS OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ARE CONTINUING TO EVOLVE. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE TYPES OF REGULATION MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT COSTS OR REQUIRE CHANGES IN PRODUCTS OR BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE. NONCOMPLIANCE COULD RESULT IN

PENALTIES BEING IMPOSED ON US OR ORDERS THAT WE STOP THE ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANT ACTIVITY.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO

ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESS IS BASED ON SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENTED EMPLOYEES. THE MARKET FOR HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS AND LEADERS IN OUR INDUSTRY IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE ARE

LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT INTERNATIONALLY BY RESTRICTIVE DOMESTIC IMMIGRATION LAWS. IF WE ARE LESS SUCCESSFUL IN OUR RECRUITING EFFORTS, OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. EFFECTIVE SUCCESSION PLANNING IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS. FAILURE TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE AND SMOOTH TRANSITIONS INVOLVING KEY EMPLOYEES COULD HINDER OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING AND

EXECUTION.

DELAYS IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS A COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS. NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS CAN REQUIRE LONG DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PERIODS. OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON DEVICES AND CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ALSO PRESENTS NEW AND COMPLEX

DEVELOPMENT ISSUES. SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE RELEASES OR SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN CREATING NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

19

ITEM 1A

ADVERSE ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS MAY HARM OUR

BUSINESS.

UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING INFLATION, RECESSION, OR OTHER CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MAY RESULT IN LOWER IT SPENDING AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. IF DEMAND FOR PCS, SERVERS,

AND OTHER COMPUTING DEVICES DECLINES, OR CONSUMER OR BUSINESS SPENDING FOR THOSE PRODUCTS DECLINES, OUR REVENUE WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. OUR PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ALSO RELIES ON AN EXTENSIVE PARTNER AND RETAIL NETWORK. OEMS BUILDING DEVICES

THAT RUN OUR SOFTWARE HAVE ALSO BEEN A SIGNIFICANT MEANS OF DISTRIBUTION. THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON OUR PARTNERS, SUCH AS THE BANKRUPTCY OF A MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR, OEM, OR RETAILER, COULD RESULT IN SALES CHANNEL DISRUPTION. CHALLENGING

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ALSO MAY IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY HAVE PURCHASED. AS A RESULT, ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND WRITE-OFFS OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MAY INCREASE. WE MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS HOLDINGS, TYPES, AND MATURITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO GENERAL CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, MARKET, AND INTEREST RATE RISKS, WHICH MAY BE EXACERBATED BY UNUSUAL EVENTS THAT AFFECT GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. A SIGNIFICANT PART OF

OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. IF GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS EXPERIENCE PROLONGED PERIODS OF DECLINE, OR IF THERE IS A DOWNGRADE OF U.S. GOVERNMENT DEBT, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY BE ADVERSELY IMPACTED AND

WE COULD DETERMINE THAT MORE OF OUR INVESTMENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE, REQUIRING IMPAIRMENT CHARGES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

WE HAVE CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AGAINST US THAT MAY RESULT IN ADVERSE OUTCOMES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF CLAIMS AND

LAWSUITS. ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN SOME OR ALL OF THESE CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. THE LITIGATION AND OTHER CLAIMS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT

UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ALSO COULD OCCUR FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECT OF AN UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOME BECOMES PROBABLE AND

REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE U.S.

AND MANY FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX DETERMINATION IS

UNCERTAIN. WE REGULARLY ARE UNDER AUDIT BY TAX AUTHORITIES. ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PRESSURES TO INCREASE TAX REVENUES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS MAY MAKE RESOLVING TAX DISPUTES MORE DIFFICULT. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX ESTIMATES ARE

REASONABLE, THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF TAX AUDITS AND ANY RELATED LITIGATION COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. THE RESULTS OF AN AUDIT OR LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE.

WE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING INCOME FROM

OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND ANY REPATRIATION OF FUNDS CURRENTLY HELD IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS TO THE U.S. MAY RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS FROM CONGRESS TO CHANGE U.S. TAX LAWS THAT WOULD

SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT HOW U.S. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS ARE TAXED ON FOREIGN EARNINGS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OR IN WHAT FORM ANY PROPOSED LEGISLATION MAY PASS, IF ENACTED IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR TAX EXPENSE AND

CASH FLOWS.

OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR SUPPLY PROBLEMS.

OUR

VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE PRODUCTS SUCH AS THE XBOX 360 CONSOLE, SURFACE, AND OTHER HARDWARE DEVICES WE DESIGN AND MARKET ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND CAN HAVE DEFECTS IN DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, OR ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE. WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT

EXPENSES, LOST REVENUE, AND REPUTATIONAL HARM IF WE FAIL TO DETECT OR EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES THROUGH DESIGN, TESTING, OR WARRANTY REPAIRS. WE OBTAIN SOME COMPONENTS OF OUR HARDWARE DEVICES FROM SOLE SUPPLIERS. OUR COMPETITORS USE SOME OF

THE SAME SUPPLIERS AND THEIR DEMAND FOR HARDWARE COMPONENTS CAN AFFECT THE AMOUNT OF CAPACITY AVAILABLE TO US. IF A COMPONENT DELIVERY FROM A SOLE-SOURCE SUPPLIER IS DELAYED OR BECOMES UNAVAILABLE OR INDUSTRY SHORTAGES OCCUR, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO

OBTAIN TIMELY REPLACEMENT SUPPLIES, RESULTING IN REDUCED SALES. COMPONENT SHORTAGES, EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY, OR PRICE REDUCTIONS RESULTING IN INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE. XBOX 360 CONSOLES AND SURFACE ARE ASSEMBLED

IN ASIA; DISRUPTIONS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN MAY RESULT IN SHORTAGES THAT WOULD AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. THESE SAME RISKS WOULD APPLY TO ANY OTHER VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE MAY OFFER.

OUR STAND-ALONE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ALSO MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR RELIABILITY PROBLEMS. THE HIGHLY SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE DEVELOP MAY

CONTAIN BUGS AND OTHER DEFECTS THAT INTERFERE WITH THEIR INTENDED OPERATION. ANY DEFECTS WE DO NOT DETECT AND FIX IN PRE-RELEASE TESTING COULD RESULT IN REDUCED SALES AND REVENUE, DAMAGE TO OUR

20

ITEM 1A, 1B

REPUTATION, REPAIR OR REMEDIATION COSTS, DELAYS IN THE RELEASE OF NEW PRODUCTS OR VERSIONS, OR LEGAL LIABILITY. ALTHOUGH OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE OR

LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO LIABILITY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THESE PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND LEGAL CHALLENGE.

IF OUR GOODWILL OR

AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME IMPAIRED WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO EARNINGS.

WE ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND MAY NOT REALIZE ALL THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT FROM THOSE

ACQUISITIONS, WHICH COULD RESULT IN AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLES. UNDER ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES, WE REVIEW OUR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES

INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. FACTORS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES, INDICATING THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS MAY

NOT BE RECOVERABLE, INCLUDE A DECLINE IN STOCK PRICE AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION, REDUCED FUTURE CASH FLOW ESTIMATES, AND SLOWER GROWTH RATES IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DURING THE

PERIOD IN WHICH ANY IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS DETERMINED, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2012, WE RECORDED A $6.2 BILLION CHARGE FOR THE

IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN OUR ONLINE SERVICES DIVISION BUSINESS SEGMENT.

WE OPERATE A GLOBAL BUSINESS THAT EXPOSES US TO ADDITIONAL

RISKS.

WE OPERATE IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES AND A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES. COMPETITIVE OR REGULATORY PRESSURE TO MAKE OUR PRICING STRUCTURE UNIFORM MIGHT REQUIRE THAT WE REDUCE THE SALES

PRICE OF OUR SOFTWARE IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES. OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TRADE PROTECTION LAWS, POLICIES AND MEASURES, AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT. THE FOREIGN CORRUPT

PRACTICES ACT AND LOCAL LAWS (ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS) PROHIBIT CORRUPT PAYMENTS BY OUR EMPLOYEES, VENDORS, OR AGENTS. WHILE WE DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO OUR GLOBAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND HAVE IMPLEMENTED CERTAIN POLICIES, TRAINING,

AND INTERNAL CONTROLS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CORRUPT PAYMENTS, IF WE FAIL TO COMPLY WITH ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS, WE MAY BE EXPOSED TO SIGNIFICANT FINES AND PENALTIES. EMERGING MARKETS ARE A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL GROWTH

STRATEGY. THE DEVELOPING NATURE OF THESE MARKETS PRESENTS A NUMBER OF RISKS. DETERIORATION OF SOCIAL, POLITICAL, LABOR, OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION, SUCH AS CURRENT UNCERTAINTIES RELATING TO EUROPEAN ECONOMIC WEAKNESS, AND

DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING FOREIGN OPERATIONS, MAY ALSO ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATIONS OR FINANCIAL RESULTS. ALTHOUGH WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY EXPOSURE, SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE U.S.

DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR GEO-POLITICAL CONDITIONS MAY DISRUPT OUR

BUSINESS.

A DISRUPTION OR FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEMS OR OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE, WEATHER EVENT, CYBER-ATTACK, TERRORIST ATTACK, OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENT COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN COMPLETING SALES, PROVIDING

SERVICES, OR PERFORMING OTHER MISSION-CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN THE SEATTLE, WASHINGTON AREA, AND

WE HAVE OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF CALIFORNIA, BOTH OF WHICH ARE NEAR MAJOR EARTHQUAKE FAULTS. A CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT RESULTS IN THE DESTRUCTION OR DISRUPTION OF ANY OF OUR CRITICAL BUSINESS OR IT SYSTEMS COULD HARM

OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. OUR MOVE TOWARD PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH MORE SERVICES AND SOLUTIONS IN THE CLOUD PUTS A PREMIUM ON THE RESILIENCE OF OUR SYSTEMS AND STRENGTH OF OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT PLANS, AND

MAGNIFIES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PROLONGED SERVICE OUTAGES ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS. ABRUPT POLITICAL CHANGE, TERRORIST ACTIVITY, AND ARMED CONFLICT POSE A RISK OF GENERAL ECONOMIC DISRUPTION IN AFFECTED COUNTRIES, WHICH MAY INCREASE OUR OPERATING

COSTS. THESE CONDITIONS ALSO MAY ADD UNCERTAINTY TO THE TIMING AND BUDGET FOR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT DECISIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS, AND MAY RESULT IN SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS FOR HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS, EITHER OF WHICH MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY IN GENERAL OR THE IT INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR ARE UNCLEAR. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY, DEMAND OR AVAILABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR COST OF

GOODS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING NATURAL RESOURCES, NECESSARY TO RUN OUR BUSINESS. CHANGES IN WEATHER WHERE WE OPERATE MAY INCREASE THE COSTS OF POWERING AND COOLING COMPUTER HARDWARE WE USE TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE AND PROVIDE CLOUD-BASED SERVICES.

SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES ARE RELATED TO COMPENSATING EMPLOYEES, DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND INCOME TAXES.

INDUSTRY TRENDS

OUR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC

AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH FREQUENT CHANGES IN BOTH TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS. EACH INDUSTRY SHIFT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONCEIVE NEW PRODUCTS, NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OR NEW IDEAS THAT CAN FURTHER TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS. AT

MICROSOFT, WE PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE THROUGH A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT SEEK TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE CHANGING DEMANDS OF CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRY TRENDS, AND COMPETITIVE FORCES.

KEY OPPORTUNITIES AND INVESTMENTS

BASED ON

OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND OUR BROAD FOCUS ON LONG-TERM RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE SEE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO GENERATE FUTURE GROWTH.

WE INVEST RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IN THESE AREAS. THE CAPABILITIES AND ACCESSIBILITY OF PCS, TABLETS,

PHONES, TELEVISIONS, AND OTHER DEVICES POWERED BY RICH SOFTWARE PLATFORMS AND APPLICATIONS CONTINUE TO GROW. WITH THIS TREND, WE BELIEVE THE FULL POTENTIAL OF SOFTWARE WILL BE SEEN AND FELT IN HOW PEOPLE USE THESE DEVICES AND THE ASSOCIATED SERVICES

AT WORK AND IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES.

DEVICES WITH END-USER SERVICES

WE WORK WITH AN ECOSYSTEM OF PARTNERS TO DELIVER A BROAD SPECTRUM OF WINDOWS DEVICES. IN SOME CASES, WE BUILD OUR OWN DEVICES, AS WE HAVE CHOSEN TO DO WITH XBOX AND SURFACE. IN ALL OUR WORK WITH PARTNERS AND ON OUR

OWN DEVICES, WE FOCUS ON DELIVERING SEAMLESS SERVICES AND EXPERIENCES ACROSS DEVICES. AS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HARDWARE ADVANCE, WE EXPECT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BETTER COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER, CONNECTING THE DEVICES PEOPLE USE DAILY TO UNIQUE

COMMUNICATIONS, PRODUCTIVITY, AND ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES FROM MICROSOFT AND OUR PARTNERS AND DEVELOPERS AROUND THE WORLD.

WINDOWS 8

REFLECTS THIS SHIFT. LAUNCHED IN OCTOBER 2012, WINDOWS 8 WAS DESIGNED TO UNITE THE LIGHT, THIN, AND CONVENIENT ASPECTS OF A TABLET WITH THE POWER OF A PC. THE WINDOWS 8 OPERATING SYSTEM INCLUDES THE WINDOWS STORE, WHICH OFFERS A LARGE AND GROWING

NUMBER OF APPLICATIONS FROM MICROSOFT AND PARTNERS FOR BOTH BUSINESS AND CONSUMER CUSTOMERS.

GOING FORWARD, OUR STRATEGY WILL FOCUS ON

CREATING A FAMILY OF DEVICES AND SERVICES FOR INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES THAT EMPOWER PEOPLE AROUND THE GLOBE AT HOME, AT WORK, AND ON THE GO, FOR THE ACTIVITIES THEY VALUE MOST. THIS STRATEGY WILL REQUIRE INVESTMENT IN DATACENTERS AND OTHER

INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR SERVICES, AND WILL BRING CONTINUED COMPETITION WITH APPLE, GOOGLE, AND OTHER WELL-ESTABLISHED AND EMERGING COMPETITORS. WE BELIEVE OUR HISTORY OF POWERING DEVICES SUCH AS WINDOWS PCS AND XBOX, AS WELL AS OUR EXPERIENCE

DELIVERING HIGH-VALUE EXPERIENCES THROUGH OFFICE AND OTHER APPLICATIONS, WILL POSITION US FOR FUTURE SUCCESS.

SERVICES FOR THE ENTERPRISE

TODAY, BUSINESSES FACE IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. ENTERPRISES ARE ASKED TO DEPLOY TECHNOLOGY THAT DRIVES BUSINESS

STRATEGY FORWARD. THEY DECIDE WHAT SOLUTIONS WILL MAKE EMPLOYEES MORE PRODUCTIVE, COLLABORATIVE, AND SATISFIED, OR CONNECT WITH CUSTOMERS IN NEW AND COMPELLING WAYS. THEY WORK TO UNLOCK BUSINESS INSIGHTS FROM A WORLD OF DATA. AT THE SAME TIME, THEY

MUST MANAGE AND SECURE CORPORATE INFORMATION THAT EMPLOYEES ACCESS ACROSS A GROWING NUMBER OF PERSONAL AND CORPORATE DEVICES.

ITEM 7

TO ADDRESS THESE OPPORTUNITIES, BUSINESSES LOOK TO OUR WORLD-CLASS BUSINESS APPLICATIONS LIKE

MICROSOFT DYNAMICS, OFFICE, EXCHANGE, SHAREPOINT, LYNC, YAMMER, AND OUR BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE SOLUTIONS. THEY RELY ON OUR TECHNOLOGY TO MANAGE EMPLOYEE CORPORATE IDENTITY AND TO PROTECT THEIR CORPORATE DATA. AND, INCREASINGLY, BUSINESSES OF ALL

SIZES ARE LOOKING TO MICROSOFT TO REALIZE THE BENEFITS OF THE CLOUD.

HELPING BUSINESSES MOVE TO THE CLOUD IS ONE OF OUR LARGEST

OPPORTUNITIES. CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND CONTENT OVER THE INTERNET BY WAY OF SHARED COMPUTING RESOURCES LOCATED IN CENTRALIZED DATA CENTERS. THE SHIFT TO THE CLOUD IS DRIVEN BY THREE IMPORTANT ECONOMIES OF

SCALE: LARGER DATA CENTERS CAN DEPLOY COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AT SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST PER UNIT THAN SMALLER ONES; LARGER DATA CENTERS CAN COORDINATE AND AGGREGATE DIVERSE CUSTOMER, GEOGRAPHIC, AND APPLICATION DEMAND PATTERNS IMPROVING THE

UTILIZATION OF COMPUTING, STORAGE, AND NETWORK RESOURCES; AND MULTI-TENANCY LOWERS APPLICATION MAINTENANCE LABOR COSTS FOR LARGE PUBLIC CLOUDS. BECAUSE OF THE IMPROVED ECONOMICS, THE CLOUD OFFERS UNIQUE LEVELS OF ELASTICITY AND AGILITY THAT ENABLE

NEW SOLUTIONS AND APPLICATIONS. FOR BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES, THE CLOUD CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY TO FOCUS ON INNOVATION WHILE LEAVING NON-DIFFERENTIATING ACTIVITIES TO RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROVIDERS.

UNIQUE TO MICROSOFT, WE CONTINUE TO DESIGN AND DELIVER CLOUD SOLUTIONS THAT ALLOW OUR CUSTOMERS TO USE BOTH THE CLOUD AND THEIR ON-PREMISE ASSETS

HOWEVER BEST SUITS THEIR OWN NEEDS. FOR EXAMPLE, A COMPANY CAN CHOOSE TO DEPLOY OFFICE OR MICROSOFT DYNAMICS ON PREMISE, AS A CLOUD SERVICE, OR A COMBINATION OF BOTH. WITH WINDOWS SERVER 2012, WINDOWS AZURE, AND SYSTEM CENTER INFRASTRUCTURE,

BUSINESSES CAN DEPLOY APPLICATIONS IN THEIR OWN DATACENTER, A PARTNERS DATACENTER, OR IN MICROSOFTS DATACENTER WITH COMMON SECURITY, MANAGEMENT, AND ADMINISTRATION ACROSS ALL ENVIRONMENTS, WITH THE FLEXIBILITY AND SCALE THEY DESIRE.

THESE HYBRID CAPABILITIES ALLOW CUSTOMERS TO FULLY HARNESS THE POWER OF THE CLOUD SO THEY CAN ACHIEVE GREATER LEVELS OF EFFICIENCY AND TAP NEW AREAS OF GROWTH.

OUR FUTURE OPPORTUNITY

THERE ARE SEVERAL DISTINCT AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE ARE FOCUSED ON

DRIVING FORWARD. OUR GOAL IS TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN THESE AREAS OVER THE LONG-TERM, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL TRANSLATE TO SUSTAINED GROWTH WELL INTO THE FUTURE. WE ARE INVESTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN.



DEVELOPING NEW FORM FACTORS THAT HAVE INCREASINGLY NATURAL WAYS TO USE THEM, INCLUDING TOUCH, GESTURE, AND SPEECH.



APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY MORE INTUITIVE AND ABLE TO ACT ON OUR BEHALF, INSTEAD OF AT OUR COMMAND.



BUILDING AND RUNNING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES IN WAYS THAT UNLEASH NEW EXPERIENCES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS.



ESTABLISHING OUR WINDOWS PLATFORM ACROSS THE PC, TABLET, PHONE, SERVER, AND CLOUD TO DRIVE A THRIVING ECOSYSTEM OF DEVELOPERS, UNIFY THE CROSS-DEVICE USER

EXPERIENCE, AND INCREASE AGILITY WHEN BRINGING NEW ADVANCES TO MARKET.



DELIVERING NEW HIGH-VALUE EXPERIENCES WITH IMPROVEMENTS IN HOW PEOPLE LEARN, WORK, PLAY, AND INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER.

WE BELIEVE THE BREADTH OF OUR DEVICES AND SERVICES PORTFOLIO, OUR LARGE, GLOBAL PARTNER AND CUSTOMER BASE, AND THE GROWING WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM

POSITION US TO BE A LEADER IN THESE AREAS.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES, AND RISKS

THE MARKET FOR SOFTWARE, DEVICES, AND CLOUD-BASED SERVICES IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. SOME OF OUR TRADITIONAL BUSINESSES SUCH AS THE

WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM ARE IN A PERIOD OF TRANSITION. OUR COMPETITORS ARE DEVELOPING NEW DEVICES AND DEPLOY COMPETING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. THE DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS CUSTOMERS PREFER EVOLVE RAPIDLY, AND INFLUENCE

HOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD AND IN SOME CASES THE USERS CHOICE OF WHICH SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO USE. THE WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM MUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND ADAPT, OVER AN EXTENDED TIME, IN PACE WITH THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. TO

SUPPORT OUR STRATEGY OF OFFERING

A FAMILY OF DEVICES AND SERVICES DESIGNED TO EMPOWER OUR CUSTOMERS FOR THE ACTIVITIES THEY VALUE MOST, WE ANNOUNCED A FUNCTIONAL REALIGNMENT IN JULY 2013. THROUGH THIS REALIGNMENT OUR GOAL IS TO

BECOME MORE NIMBLE, COLLABORATIVE, COMMUNICATIVE, MOTIVATED, AND DECISIVE. EVEN IF WE ACHIEVE THESE BENEFITS, THE INVESTMENTS WE ARE MAKING IN DEVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES WILL INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND MAY

DECREASE OUR OPERATION MARGINS.

WE PRIORITIZE OUR INVESTMENTS AMONG THE HIGHEST LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS

REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND ARE MULTI-YEAR IN NATURE. THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE BRING TO MARKET MAY BE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY, AS PART OF A PARTNERSHIP OR ALLIANCE, OR THROUGH ACQUISITION.

OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. WE HIRE A MIX OF UNIVERSITY AND INDUSTRY TALENT

WORLDWIDE. MICROSOFT COMPETES FOR TALENTED INDIVIDUALS WORLDWIDE BY OFFERING BROAD CUSTOMER REACH, SCALE IN RESOURCES, AND COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION.

AGGREGATE DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND HARDWARE IS CORRELATED TO GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC FACTORS, WHICH REMAIN DYNAMIC. SEE A DISCUSSION OF THESE FACTORS AND OTHER RISKS UNDER RISK FACTORS (PART I,

ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K).

SEASONALITY

OUR REVENUE HISTORICALLY HAS FLUCTUATED QUARTERLY AND HAS GENERALLY BEEN HIGHEST IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR DUE TO CORPORATE CALENDAR YEAR-END SPENDING TRENDS IN OUR MAJOR MARKETS AND HOLIDAY SEASON

SPENDING BY CONSUMERS. OUR ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION IS PARTICULARLY SEASONAL AS ITS PRODUCTS ARE AIMED AT THE CONSUMER MARKET AND ARE IN HIGHEST DEMAND DURING THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON. TYPICALLY, THE ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION

HAS GENERATED APPROXIMATELY 40% OF ITS YEARLY REVENUE IN OUR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER.

UNEARNED REVENUE

QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL REVENUE MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE DEFERRAL OF REVENUE. SEE THE DISCUSSIONS BELOW REGARDING REVENUE DEFERRED ON SALES OF WINDOWS 7

WITH AN OPTION TO UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 8 PRO AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE (THE WINDOWS UPGRADE OFFER) AND SALES OF THE PREVIOUS VERSION OF THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM WITH A GUARANTEE TO BE UPGRADED TO THE NEW OFFICE AT MINIMAL OR NO COST (THE

OFFICE UPGRADE OFFER, FOR THE OFFER RELATING TO THE NEW OFFICE, AND THE 2010 OFFICE UPGRADE OFFER FOR THE PRIOR OFFER RELATING TO OFFICE 2010).

IF OUR CUSTOMERS ELECT TO LICENSE CLOUD-BASED VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RATHER THAN LICENSING TRANSACTION-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE ASSOCIATED REVENUE WILL SHIFT FROM BEING RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME

OF THE TRANSACTION TO BEING RECOGNIZED OVER THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD OR UPON CONSUMPTION, AS APPLICABLE.

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO: MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND

CREDIT; ENHANCE INVESTMENT RETURNS; AND FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES ARE PRIMARILY RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE). OTHER THAN THOSE

DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, SUCH AS COMMODITY CONTRACTS, THE GAINS (LOSSES) ARE GENERALLY ECONOMICALLY OFFSET BY UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) IN THE UNDERLYING AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF

OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) UNTIL THE SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, AT WHICH TIME THE AMOUNTS ARE RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) INTO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).

FISCAL YEAR 2013 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2012

DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST INCOME DECREASED DUE TO LOWER YIELDS ON OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS, OFFSET IN PART BY HIGHER AVERAGE PORTFOLIO INVESTMENT BALANCES. NET RECOGNIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS DECREASED PRIMARILY

INCOME TAXES

FISCAL YEAR 2013 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2012

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEARS 2013

AND 2012 WAS APPROXIMATELY 19% AND 24%, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO.

OUR FISCAL YEAR 2013

EFFECTIVE RATE DECREASED BY 5% FROM FISCAL YEAR 2012 MAINLY DUE TO A NONRECURRING $6.2 BILLION NON-TAX DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE THAT WAS RECORDED IN FISCAL YEAR 2012. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE INCREASED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY

10% IN FISCAL YEAR 2012. IN ADDITION, IN FISCAL YEARS 2013 AND 2012, WE RECOGNIZED A REDUCTION OF 18% AND 21%, RESPECTIVELY, TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DUE TO FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES. THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL

YEAR 2013 WAS PRIMARILY OFFSET BY A 1% INCREASE RELATED TO THE EU FINE, WHICH IS NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE.

CHANGES IN THE MIX OF INCOME

BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES ALSO IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. AS DISCUSSED ABOVE,

WINDOWS DIVISION OPERATING INCOME DECLINED $2.1 BILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2013, WHILE MBD AND SERVER AND TOOLS OPERATING INCOME INCREASED $362 MILLION AND $929 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THIS SAME PERIOD. WE SUPPLY WINDOWS, OUR PRIMARY WINDOWS

DIVISION PRODUCT, TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR U.S. REGIONAL OPERATING CENTER, WHILE WE SUPPLY THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, OUR PRIMARY MBD PRODUCT, AND OUR SERVER AND TOOLS PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS. IN

FISCAL YEARS 2013 AND 2012, OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $6.7 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 25% AND 7%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2013 AND 2012, THE FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE

INCOME TAXES WAS $20.4 BILLION AND $20.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 75% AND 93%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE INCREASE IN THE U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX IN FISCAL YEAR 2013 WAS THE GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECORDED DURING THE PRIOR YEAR.

TAX CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER TAX LIABILITIES WERE $9.4 BILLION AND $7.6 BILLION AS OF

JUNE 30, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THIS INCREASE RELATES PRIMARILY TO TRANSFER PRICING, INCLUDING TRANSFER PRICING DEVELOPMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS, PRIMARILY DENMARK. WHILE

WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S. AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REMAIN UNDER AUDIT FOR THOSE YEARS. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE I.R.S. WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS REPORT AND REOPENED THE AUDIT

PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE

THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS BECAUSE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE REMAINING OPEN ISSUES WILL BE RESOLVED WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO

EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2012.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR

OPERATIONS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR TAX YEARS 1996 TO 2012, SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES. THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE AUDITS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011 WERE APPROXIMATELY 24% AND 18%, RESPECTIVELY. OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES WERE LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER

RATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO.

OUR FISCAL YEAR 2012 EFFECTIVE RATE INCREASED BY 6% FROM FISCAL YEAR 2011 MAINLY DUE TO A NONRECURRING $6.2 BILLION NON-TAX DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT CHARGE THAT WAS RECORDED IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF 2012. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE INCREASED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 10%. IN ADDITION, IN FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011, WE RECOGNIZED

36

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

A REDUCTION OF 21% AND 16%, RESPECTIVELY, TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DUE TO FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES. IN FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE SETTLED A PORTION OF AN I.R.S. AUDIT OF TAX YEARS 2004 TO

2006, WHICH REDUCED OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2011 BY $461 MILLION AND REDUCED THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 2%.

CHANGES IN

THE MIX OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES ALSO IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. AS

DISCUSSED ABOVE, WINDOWS DIVISION OPERATING INCOME DECLINED $751 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2012, WHILE MBD AND SERVER AND TOOLS OPERATING INCOME INCREASED $1.1 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THIS SAME PERIOD. WE SUPPLY

WINDOWS, OUR PRIMARY WINDOWS DIVISION PRODUCT, TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR U.S. REGIONAL OPERATING CENTER, WHILE WE SUPPLY THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, OUR PRIMARY MBD PRODUCT, AND OUR SERVER AND TOOLS PRODUCTS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL

OPERATIONS CENTERS. IN FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011, OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $1.6 BILLION AND $8.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 7% AND 32%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2012 AND 2011, THE

FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $20.7 BILLION AND $19.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 93% AND 68%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. THE PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE DECREASE IN THE U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX IN FISCAL YEAR

2012 WAS THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS

TOTALED $77.0 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, COMPARED WITH $63.0 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012. EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE $10.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, COMPARED WITH $9.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2012. OUR SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY TO FACILITATE LIQUIDITY AND FOR CAPITAL PRESERVATION. THEY CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. THE INVESTMENTS ARE

PREDOMINANTLY U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SECURITIES IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY RISK. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE

MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE MANAGED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME INDICES. THE SETTLEMENT RISK RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS INSIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD ARE PRIMARILY

HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES. WHILE WE OWN CERTAIN MORTGAGE-BACKED AND ASSET-BACKED FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, OUR PORTFOLIO AS OF JUNE 30, 2013 DOES NOT CONTAIN MATERIAL DIRECT EXPOSURE TO SUBPRIME MORTGAGES OR

STRUCTURED VEHICLES THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM SUBPRIME COLLATERAL. THE MAJORITY OF OUR MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY PRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND CARRY A 100% PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST GUARANTEE, PRIMARILY FROM FEDERAL NATIONAL

MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION, AND GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION.

WE ROUTINELY MONITOR OUR

FINANCIAL EXPOSURE TO BOTH SOVEREIGN AND NON-SOVEREIGN BORROWERS AND COUNTERPARTIES. OUR GROSS EXPOSURES TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND INVESTMENTS IN PORTUGAL, ITALY, IRELAND, GREECE, AND SPAIN ARE INDIVIDUALLY AND COLLECTIVELY NOT MATERIAL.

OF THE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AT JUNE 30, 2013, APPROXIMATELY $69.6 BILLION WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES

AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL REPATRIATION TAX EFFECTS. THE AMOUNT OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO OTHER RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREE FLOW OF FUNDS (PRIMARILY CURRENCY AND OTHER LOCAL

REGULATORY) WAS APPROXIMATELY $880 MILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, APPROXIMATELY 87% OF THE CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE INVESTED IN U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, APPROXIMATELY 4% WERE

INVESTED IN CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS OF U.S. COMPANIES, AND 2% WERE INVESTED IN U.S. MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS.

SECURITIES LENDING

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT

RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE

CREDITWORTHINESS OF

THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. OUR SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCE WAS $645 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013. OUR AVERAGE AND MAXIMUM

SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WERE $494 MILLION AND $1.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INTRA-YEAR VARIANCES IN THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES LOANED ARE MAINLY DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DEMAND FOR THE SECURITIES.

VALUATION

IN GENERAL, AND WHERE

APPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS EXCHANGE-TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS,

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, THEN WE USE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR

INPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS SUCH AS CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AND U.S.

AGENCY SECURITIES. LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS WITH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN IMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.

A MAJORITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRICED BY PRICING VENDORS AND ARE GENERALLY LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS AS THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A

QUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THEIR PRICING WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. BROKER PRICING IS USED MAINLY WHEN A QUOTED PRICE IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE INVESTMENT IS NOT PRICED BY OUR PRICING VENDORS, OR

WHEN A BROKER PRICE IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF FAIR VALUES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT TRADES. OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THE BROKER PRICES THESE INVESTMENTS BASED ON SIMILAR ASSETS

WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION, ALL OF OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS HAVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF TRADING VOLUME TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FAIR VALUES USED ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THESE INVESTMENTS. OUR FAIR VALUE PROCESSES INCLUDE

CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED. THESE CONTROLS INCLUDE MODEL VALIDATION, REVIEW OF KEY MODEL INPUTS, ANALYSIS OF PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS, AND INDEPENDENT RECALCULATION OF PRICES WHERE APPROPRIATE.

CASH FLOWS

FISCAL YEAR 2013 COMPARED WITH

FISCAL YEAR 2012

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS DECREASED $2.8 BILLION DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TO $28.8 BILLION, DUE MAINLY TO

CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, INCLUDING INCREASES IN INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS. CASH USED FOR FINANCING DECREASED $1.3 BILLION TO $8.1 BILLION, DUE MAINLY TO A $3.5 BILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF DEBT, NET OF REPAYMENTS,

OFFSET IN PART BY A $1.1 BILLION INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS PAID AND A $982 MILLION DECREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK. CASH USED IN INVESTING DECREASED $975 MILLION TO $23.8 BILLION, DUE MAINLY TO AN $8.5 BILLION DECREASE IN

CASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS OF COMPANIES AND PURCHASES OF INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS, OFFSET IN PART BY A $5.8 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR NET INVESTMENT PURCHASES, MATURITIES, AND SALES AND A $2.0 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR ADDITIONS

TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.

FISCAL YEAR 2012 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2011

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $4.6 BILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2012 TO $31.6 BILLION, DUE MAINLY TO INCREASED REVENUE AND CASH COLLECTIONS

FROM CUSTOMERS. CASH USED FOR FINANCING INCREASED $1.0 BILLION TO $9.4 BILLION, DUE MAINLY TO A $6.0 BILLION NET DECREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF DEBT AND A $1.2 BILLION INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS PAID, OFFSET IN PART BY A $6.5 BILLION DECREASE IN

CASH USED FOR COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. CASH USED IN INVESTING INCREASED $10.2 BILLION TO $24.8 BILLION, DUE MAINLY TO A $10.0 BILLION INCREASE IN ACQUISITIONS OF BUSINESSES AND PURCHASES OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND A $1.4 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH FROM

SECURITIES LENDING ACTIVITIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $1.2 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR NET PURCHASES, MATURITIES, AND SALES OF INVESTMENTS.

DEBT

WE ISSUED DEBT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE PRICING AND LIQUIDITY IN THE DEBT MARKETS, REFLECTING OUR CREDIT RATING AND THE LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. THE PROCEEDS OF THESE ISSUANCES WERE OR WILL BE USED FOR

GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUNDING FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, REPURCHASES OF CAPITAL STOCK, ACQUISITIONS, AND REPAYMENT OF EXISTING DEBT.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE TOTAL CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT, INCLUDING THE CURRENT PORTION, WERE $15.6

BILLION AND $15.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THIS IS COMPARED TO A CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF $11.9 BILLION AND $13.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AS OF JUNE 30, 2012. THESE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ARE BASED ON LEVEL 2 INPUTS.

CONVERTIBLE DEBT

IN JUNE 2013, WE PAID CASH OF $1.25 BILLION FOR THE PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF OUR ZERO COUPON CONVERTIBLE UNSECURED DEBT AND ELECTED TO DELIVER CASH FOR THE $96 MILLION EXCESS OBLIGATION RESULTING FROM THE CONVERSION OF

THE NOTES. EACH $1,000 PRINCIPAL AMOUNT OF NOTES WAS CONVERTIBLE INTO 30.68 SHARES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK AT A CONVERSION PRICE OF $32.59 PER SHARE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE NET CARRYING AMOUNT OF THE CONVERTIBLE DEBT AND THE UNAMORTIZED

DISCOUNT WERE $1.2 BILLION AND $19 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE ISSUANCE OF THE NOTES IN 2010, WE ENTERED INTO CAPPED

CALL TRANSACTIONS WITH CERTAIN OPTION COUNTERPARTIES WITH A STRIKE PRICE EQUAL TO THE CONVERSION PRICE OF THE NOTES. UPON CONVERSION OF THE NOTES IN JUNE 2013, WE EXERCISED THE CAPPED CALLS. THE BULK OF THE CAPPED CALLS WERE PHYSICALLY SETTLED BY

ACQUIRING 29 MILLION SHARES OF OUR OWN COMMON STOCK FOR $938 MILLION. THE REMAINING CAPPED CALLS WERE NET CASH SETTLED FOR $24 MILLION.

CREDIT

FACILITY

IN JUNE 2013, WE ESTABLISHED A COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM FOR THE ISSUANCE AND SALE OF UP TO $1.3 BILLION IN COMMERCIAL

PAPER. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, WE HAVE NOT ISSUED ANY COMMERCIAL PAPER UNDER THIS PROGRAM.

IN JUNE 2013, WE ENTERED INTO A $1.3

BILLION CREDIT FACILITY, WHICH WILL SERVE AS A BACK-UP FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ONLY FINANCIAL COVENANT IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN A COVERAGE RATIO OF AT

LEAST THREE TIMES EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION TO INTEREST EXPENSE, AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. THE CREDIT FACILITY EXPIRES ON JUNE 24, 2018. NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN AGAINST THE CREDIT FACILITY SINCE ITS

INCEPTION.

UNEARNED REVENUE

UNEARNED REVENUE AT JUNE 30, 2013 COMPRISED MAINLY UNEARNED REVENUE FROM VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS. UNEARNED REVENUE FROM VOLUME LICENSING

PROGRAMS REPRESENTS CUSTOMER BILLINGS FOR MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS PAID FOR EITHER AT INCEPTION OF THE AGREEMENT OR ANNUALLY AT THE BEGINNING OF EACH COVERAGE PERIOD AND ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS WITH REVENUE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER

THE COVERAGE PERIOD. UNEARNED REVENUE AT JUNE 30, 2013 ALSO INCLUDED PAYMENTS FOR: POST-DELIVERY SUPPORT AND CONSULTING SERVICES TO BE PERFORMED IN THE FUTURE; XBOX LIVE SUBSCRIPTIONS AND PREPAID POINTS; OEM MINIMUM COMMITMENTS; MICROSOFT

OF $162 MILLION (RELATED TO THE ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS) FROM THE AMOUNTS PRESENTED, AS THE AMOUNTS THAT WILL BE SETTLED IN CASH ARE NOT KNOWN AND THE TIMING OF ANY PAYMENTS IS UNCERTAIN. WE HAVE ALSO EXCLUDED UNEARNED

REVENUE AND NON-CASH ITEMS.

OTHER PLANNED USES OF CAPITAL

WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES, MARKETING, PRODUCT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EXISTING AND ADVANCED AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY. ADDITIONS TO

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WILL CONTINUE, INCLUDING NEW FACILITIES, DATA CENTERS, AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, SUPPORT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO INCREASE IN COMING YEARS IN

SUPPORT OF OUR CLOUD AND DEVICES STRATEGY. WE HAVE OPERATING LEASES FOR MOST U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES AND SUPPORT OFFICES AND CERTAIN EQUIPMENT. WE HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

OR OTHER PERSONS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT LIQUIDITY OR THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL RESOURCES.

LIQUIDITY

WE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING INCOME OUTSIDE THE U.S., WHICH IS DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. AS A

RESULT, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS, THE MAJORITY OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT INTEND NOR FORESEE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THESE

FUNDS. WE EXPECT EXISTING DOMESTIC CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR DOMESTIC OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES,

SUCH AS REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, DEBT REPAYMENT SCHEDULES, AND MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT EXISTING FOREIGN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR FOREIGN OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER

FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

SHOULD WE REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THAN IS GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS DOMESTICALLY, FOR EXAMPLE TO

FUND SIGNIFICANT DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, WE COULD ELECT TO REPATRIATE FUTURE EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS OR RAISE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUANCES. THESE ALTERNATIVES

COULD RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, OR DILUTION OF OUR EARNINGS. WE HAVE BORROWED FUNDS DOMESTICALLY AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

RECENTLY

ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

IN SEPTEMBER 2011, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE ON

TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE NEW GUIDANCE PROVIDES AN ENTITY THE OPTION TO FIRST PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF AN

ENTITY DETERMINES THAT THIS IS THE CASE, IT IS REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE RECOGNIZED FOR THAT REPORTING UNIT (IF ANY).

IF AN ENTITY DETERMINES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS GREATER THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS NOT REQUIRED. WE ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE BEGINNING JULY 1, 2012. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE DID

NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE

INCOME. THE NEW GUIDANCE ELIMINATED THE OPTION TO REPORT OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) AND ITS COMPONENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. INSTEAD, AN ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO PRESENT EITHER A

CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF NET INCOME AND OCI OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. WE ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE BEGINNING JULY 1, 2012. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE RESULTED ONLY IN CHANGES TO PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE NOT YET ADOPTED

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ENHANCING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE NATURE OF AN ENTITYS RIGHT TO OFFSET AND RELATED

ARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF THE GROSS AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO RIGHTS OF SET-OFF, AMOUNTS OFFSET IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOLLOWED, AND

THE RELATED NET EXPOSURE. IN JANUARY 2013, THE FASB CLARIFIED THAT THE SCOPE OF THIS GUIDANCE APPLIES TO DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING BIFURCATED EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND SECURITIES BORROWING AND

SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE EITHER OFFSET OR SUBJECT TO AN ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT, OR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL

DISCLOSURES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.

IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE FASB ISSUED

GUIDANCE ON DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR ITEMS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI). THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES ENTITIES TO PRESENT (EITHER ON THE FACE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT OR IN THE NOTES) THE EFFECTS ON

THE LINE ITEMS OF THE INCOME STATEMENT FOR AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF AOCI. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.

IN MARCH 2013, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON A PARENTS ACCOUNTING FOR THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION

ADJUSTMENT UPON DERECOGNITION OF A SUBSIDIARY OR GROUP OF ASSETS WITHIN A FOREIGN ENTITY. THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT THE PARENT RELEASE ANY RELATED CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT INTO NET INCOME ONLY IF THE SALE OR TRANSFER RESULTS IN THE

COMPLETE OR SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE LIQUIDATION OF THE FOREIGN ENTITY IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OR GROUP OF ASSETS HAD RESIDED. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2014. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO

MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENTS APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR US

INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, CONTINGENCIES, INCOME TAXES, AND INVENTORIES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING WHETHER A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT INCLUDES MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, AND IF SO, WHETHER THE VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE) OF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR THOSE ELEMENTS. A PORTION OF REVENUE MAY BE RECORDED AS

UNEARNED DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS. CHANGES TO THE ELEMENTS IN A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY THE VSOE FOR THOSE ELEMENTS, AND THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF EARNED AND UNEARNED

REVENUE. JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER FUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS. CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS

COMBINED WITH RIGHTS TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS (SOFTWARE ASSURANCE) AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE

PERIOD.

SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, WHICH MAY

REQUIRE REVENUE TO BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED WHEN THE UPGRADE IS DELIVERED, OR IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED POST-CONTRACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT (PCS) IS BEING PROVIDED, REVENUE FROM THE ARRANGEMENT IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE

IMPLIED PCS TERM. IF UPDATES ARE DETERMINED TO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE.

WINDOWS 8.1 WILL ENABLE NEW HARDWARE, FURTHER THE INTEGRATION WITH OTHER MICROSOFT SERVICES AND ADDRESS CUSTOMER ISSUES WITH WINDOWS 8, AND WILL BE PROVIDED TO WINDOWS 8 CUSTOMERS WHEN AVAILABLE AT NO ADDITIONAL

CHARGE. WE EVALUATED WINDOWS 8.1 AND DETERMINED THAT IT DID NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE AND THUS HAVE NOT DEFERRED REVENUE RELATED TO THIS PLANNED RELEASE.

43

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

WINDOWS 7 REVENUE WAS SUBJECT TO DEFERRAL AS A RESULT OF THE WINDOWS UPGRADE OFFER, WHICH STARTED

JUNE 2, 2012. THE OFFER PROVIDED SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED RIGHTS TO PURCHASE WINDOWS 8 PRO TO QUALIFYING END-USERS THAT PURCHASED WINDOWS 7 PCS DURING THE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD. MICROSOFT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING WINDOWS 8 PRO TO THE END

CUSTOMER. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE RELATED TO THE ALLOCATED DISCOUNT FOR UNDELIVERED WINDOWS 8 WAS DEFERRED UNTIL IT WAS DELIVERED OR THE REDEMPTION PERIOD EXPIRED.

MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM REVENUE WAS SUBJECT TO DEFERRAL AS A RESULT OF THE OFFICE UPGRADE OFFER, WHICH STARTED OCTOBER 19, 2012. THE OFFICE UPGRADE OFFER ALLOWED CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASED QUALIFYING 2010

MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM OR OFFICE FOR MAC 2011 PRODUCTS TO RECEIVE, AT NO COST, A ONE-YEAR SUBSCRIPTION TO OFFICE 365 HOME PREMIUM OR THE EQUIVALENT VERSION OF 2013 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM UPON GENERAL AVAILABILITY. SMALL BUSINESS CUSTOMERS IN

APPLICABLE MARKETS WERE ALSO ELIGIBLE FOR A THREE-MONTH TRIAL OF OFFICE 365 SMALL BUSINESS PREMIUM. ACCORDINGLY, ESTIMATED REVENUE RELATED TO THE UNDELIVERED 2013 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND SUBSCRIPTION SERVICES WAS DEFERRED UNTIL THE PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES WERE DELIVERED OR THE REDEMPTION PERIOD EXPIRED.

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES

WE REVIEW INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS

JUDGMENT, WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY QUARTERLY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG

OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR

FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL

HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IF MARKET, INDUSTRY, AND/OR INVESTEE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.

GOODWILL

WE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO REPORTING

UNITS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR

VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, COMPETITION, OR SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT.

APPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF REPORTING

UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW

METHODOLOGY. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS, ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, ESTIMATION OF THE USEFUL LIFE OVER WHICH

CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.

THE ESTIMATES USED TO CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF A

REPORTING UNIT CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON OPERATING RESULTS, MARKET CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH REPORTING

UNIT.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

COSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS

ESTABLISHED, ALL

44

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

SOFTWARE COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE

HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED AFTER ALL HIGH-RISK DEVELOPMENT ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED THROUGH CODING AND TESTING. GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO

MANUFACTURING. THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE COSTS IS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE PRODUCTS.

LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

THE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A

LOSS CONTINGENCY SUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM IS ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DISCLOSURE OF A

CONTINGENCY IS REQUIRED IF THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS SHOULD BE ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE

ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME TAXES

THE OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND

DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY

THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST

BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ACCOUNTING LITERATURE ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS

AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX

RETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST, SUBJECT TO THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. COST INCLUDES MATERIALS, LABOR, AND MANUFACTURING

OVERHEAD RELATED TO THE PURCHASE AND PRODUCTION OF INVENTORIES. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVENTORY QUANTITIES ON HAND, FUTURE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, AND THE ESTIMATED UTILITY OF OUR INVENTORY. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE ANALYSIS OF DEMAND

FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS, PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS, PRICING STRATEGY, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. IF OUR REVIEW INDICATES A REDUCTION IN UTILITY BELOW CARRYING VALUE, WE REDUCE OUR INVENTORY TO A NEW COST BASIS

THROUGH A CHARGE TO COST OF REVENUE. THE DETERMINATION OF MARKET VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED VOLUME OF DEMAND USED IN THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET ANALYSIS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT.

WE ARE EXPOSED TO ECONOMIC RISK FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT RISK, EQUITY PRICES, AND COMMODITY PRICES. A PORTION OF THESE RISKS IS HEDGED, BUT THEY MAY IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY AND

USE HEDGES WHERE PRACTICABLE TO OFFSET THE RISKS AND MAXIMIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR.

INTEREST RATE

OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO

IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS CREDIT SECTORS AND MATURITIES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF THE FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL AND

DOMESTIC FIXED-INCOME INDICES. IN ADDITION, WE USE TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO AGENCY AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

EQUITY

OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF

GLOBAL, DEVELOPED, AND EMERGING MARKET SECURITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. WE MANAGE THE SECURITIES RELATIVE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC INDICES AND EXPECT THEIR ECONOMIC RISK AND RETURN TO CORRELATE WITH THESE INDICES.

COMMODITY

WE USE BROAD-BASED COMMODITY

EXPOSURES TO ENHANCE PORTFOLIO RETURNS AND FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS EXPOSURE TO A VARIETY OF COMMODITIES, INCLUDING PRECIOUS METALS, ENERGY, AND GRAIN. WE MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO GLOBAL COMMODITY

INDICES AND EXPECT THEIR ECONOMIC RISK AND RETURN TO CORRELATE WITH THESE INDICES.

VALUE-AT-RISK

WE USE A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE AND QUANTIFY OUR MARKET RISKS. VAR IS THE EXPECTED LOSS, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE LEVEL,

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING DETERMINATIONS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S. GAAP), BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF ALL HOLDINGS IS COMPUTED

BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS AMONG FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, AND COMMODITY PRICES, ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE VAR IS CALCULATED AS THE TOTAL LOSS THAT WILL NOT BE EXCEEDED AT THE 97.5 PERCENTILE CONFIDENCE LEVEL OR, ALTERNATIVELY STATED, THE LOSSES

COULD EXCEED THE VAR IN 25 OUT OF 1,000 CASES. SEVERAL RISK FACTORS ARE NOT CAPTURED IN THE MODEL, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, AND LEGAL RISK.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF

AMERICA (U.S. GAAP).

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. EQUITY INVESTMENTS THROUGH WHICH WE EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE OVER BUT DO NOT CONTROL THE INVESTEE AND ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE INVESTEES ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD. INVESTMENTS THROUGH WHICH WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE

INVESTEE AND WHICH DO NOT HAVE READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE COST METHOD.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES,

REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. EXAMPLES OF ESTIMATES INCLUDE: LOSS CONTINGENCIES; PRODUCT WARRANTIES; THE FAIR VALUE OF, AND/OR POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR, OUR REPORTING UNITS; PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES; USEFUL LIVES OF OUR TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS;

ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS; ALLOWANCES FOR PRODUCT RETURNS; THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY; AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FORFEITURE RATES. EXAMPLES OF ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE: THE ELEMENTS COMPRISING A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, INCLUDING THE

DISTINCTION BETWEEN UPGRADES OR ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW PRODUCTS; WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ACHIEVED FOR OUR PRODUCTS; THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX

RETURNS; AND DETERMINING WHEN INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ACTUAL RESULTS AND OUTCOMES MAY DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT

THE EXCHANGE RATE ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM THIS PROCESS ARE RECORDED TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME

(OCI).

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE FEE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTIBILITY IS PROBABLE. REVENUE GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED NET OF ALLOWANCES

FOR RETURNS AND ANY TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.

REVENUE FOR RETAIL PACKAGED

PRODUCTS, PRODUCTS LICENSED TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS), AND PERPETUAL LICENSES UNDER CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE.

TECHNOLOGY GUARANTEE PROGRAMS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS AS CUSTOMERS RECEIVE FREE OR SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED RIGHTS TO

USE UPCOMING NEW VERSIONS OF A SOFTWARE PRODUCT IF THEY LICENSE EXISTING VERSIONS OF THE PRODUCT DURING THE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD. REVENUE IS ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE EXISTING PRODUCT AND THE NEW PRODUCT, AND REVENUE ALLOCATED TO THE NEW PRODUCT IS

DEFERRED UNTIL THAT VERSION IS DELIVERED. THE REVENUE ALLOCATION IS BASED ON THE VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE) OF FAIR VALUE OF THE PRODUCTS. THE VSOE OF FAIR VALUE FOR UPCOMING NEW PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON THE PRICE DETERMINED

BY MANAGEMENT HAVING THE RELEVANT AUTHORITY WHEN THE ELEMENT IS NOT YET SOLD SEPARATELY, BUT IS EXPECTED TO BE SOLD IN THE NEAR FUTURE AT THE PRICE SET BY MANAGEMENT.

54

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

SOFTWARE UPDATES THAT WILL BE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE ARE EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS TO

DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE AND CREATE A MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT, WHICH MAY REQUIRE REVENUE TO BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED WHEN THE UPGRADE IS DELIVERED, OR IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED POST-CONTRACT CUSTOMER

SUPPORT (PCS) IS BEING PROVIDED, THE ARRANGEMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT AND ALL REVENUE FROM THE ARRANGEMENT IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE IMPLIED PCS TERM WHEN THE VSOE OF FAIR VALUE DOES NOT EXIST. IF

UPDATES ARE DETERMINED TO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE. WINDOWS 8.1 WILL ENABLE NEW HARDWARE, FURTHER THE INTEGRATION WITH OTHER MICROSOFT SERVICES AND FIX SOME OF

THE CUSTOMER ISSUES WITH WINDOWS 8, AND WILL BE PROVIDED TO WINDOWS 8 CUSTOMERS WHEN AVAILABLE AT NO ADDITIONAL CHARGE. WE EVALUATED WINDOWS 8.1 AND DETERMINED THAT IT DID NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE AND THUS HAVE NOT DEFERRED REVENUE

RELATED TO THIS PLANNED RELEASE.

CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH

RIGHTS TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS (SOFTWARE ASSURANCE), WHICH WE HAVE DETERMINED ARE ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND ARE THEREFORE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED

REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD. ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE TERM BASED LICENSES FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS WITH THE RIGHT TO USE UNSPECIFIED FUTURE VERSIONS OF THE SOFTWARE DURING THE COVERAGE PERIOD, ARE ALSO ACCOUNTED

FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH REVENUE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD.

REVENUE FROM CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS THAT

ALLOW FOR THE USE OF A HOSTED SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR SERVICE OVER A CONTRACTUALLY DETERMINED PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT TAKING POSSESSION OF SOFTWARE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE

RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD BEGINNING ON THE DATE THE SERVICE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS. REVENUE FROM CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE PROVIDED ON A CONSUMPTION BASIS (FOR EXAMPLE, THE AMOUNT OF STORAGE USED IN A PARTICULAR

PERIOD) IS RECOGNIZED COMMENSURATE WITH THE CUSTOMER UTILIZATION OF SUCH RESOURCES.

SOME VOLUME LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE

TIME-BASED SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES AND SOFTWARE OFFERINGS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE CONSIDERED MULTIPLE ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE ALL ELEMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND

HAVE THE SAME COVERAGE PERIOD AND DELIVERY PATTERN, THEY HAVE THE SAME REVENUE RECOGNITION TIMING.

REVENUE RELATED TO SURFACE, OUR XBOX

360 GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLE, KINECT FOR XBOX 360, GAMES PUBLISHED BY US, AND OTHER HARDWARE COMPONENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN OWNERSHIP IS TRANSFERRED TO THE RESELLERS OR END CUSTOMERS WHEN SELLING DIRECTLY THROUGH MICROSOFT STORES.

REVENUE RELATED TO GAMES PUBLISHED BY THIRD PARTIES FOR USE ON THE XBOX 360 PLATFORM IS RECOGNIZED WHEN GAMES ARE MANUFACTURED BY THE GAME PUBLISHERS.

DISPLAY ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS ADVERTISEMENTS ARE DISPLAYED. SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE AD APPEARS IN THE SEARCH RESULTS OR WHEN THE ACTION NECESSARY TO EARN THE REVENUE HAS

BEEN COMPLETED. CONSULTING SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED, GENERALLY BASED ON THE NEGOTIATED HOURLY RATE IN THE CONSULTING ARRANGEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED DURING THE PERIOD. CONSULTING REVENUE FOR FIXED-PRICE

SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. REVENUE FROM PREPAID POINTS REDEEMABLE FOR THE PURCHASE OF SOFTWARE OR SERVICES IS RECOGNIZED UPON REDEMPTION OF THE POINTS AND DELIVERY OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES.

COST OF REVENUE

COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES.

MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS FOR PRODUCTS SOLD AND PROGRAMS LICENSED; OPERATING COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICE CENTERS AND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS; COSTS INCURRED TO INCLUDE SOFTWARE ON PCS SOLD BY OEMS, TO DRIVE TRAFFIC TO

OUR WEBSITES, AND TO ACQUIRE ONLINE ADVERTISING SPACE (TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS); COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN INTERNET-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING DATACENTER COSTS AND ROYALTIES; WARRANTY COSTS; INVENTORY VALUATION

ADJUSTMENTS; COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELIVERY OF CONSULTING SERVICES; AND THE AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS. CAPITALIZED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PRODUCTS.

55

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

PRODUCT WARRANTY

WE PROVIDE FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FOR HARDWARE WARRANTIES, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS BASED ON

HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED PRODUCT FAILURE RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED REPAIR COSTS, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES (IF ANY). THE SPECIFIC HARDWARE WARRANTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS VARY DEPENDING UPON THE PRODUCT SOLD AND THE COUNTRY IN

WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, BUT GENERALLY INCLUDE PARTS AND LABOR OVER A PERIOD GENERALLY RANGING FROM 90 DAYS TO THREE YEARS. FOR SOFTWARE WARRANTIES, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS TO PROVIDE BUG FIXES, SUCH AS SECURITY PATCHES, OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF

THE SOFTWARE. WE REGULARLY REEVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF THE RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUST THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND

PROGRAMMING COSTS, LOCALIZATION COSTS INCURRED TO TRANSLATE SOFTWARE FOR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND THE AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED SOFTWARE CODE AND SERVICES CONTENT. SUCH COSTS RELATED TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ARE INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE UNTIL THE POINT THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS REACHED, WHICH FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, IS GENERALLY SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS REACHED, SUCH COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND

AMORTIZED TO COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PRODUCTS.

SALES AND MARKETING

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED

WITH SALES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL, AND THE COSTS OF ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS, TRADE SHOWS, SEMINARS, AND OTHER PROGRAMS. ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $2.6 BILLION, $1.6 BILLION, AND $1.9 BILLION IN FISCAL YEARS

2013, 2012, AND 2011, RESPECTIVELY.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

WE MEASURE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND RECOGNIZE IT AS EXPENSE, NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES, OVER THE VESTING OR SERVICE PERIOD, AS APPLICABLE, OF THE

STOCK AWARD (GENERALLY FOUR TO FIVE YEARS) USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE PURCHASED BY EMPLOYEES AT THREE-MONTH INTERVALS AT 90% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE STOCK ON THE LAST DAY OF

EACH THREE-MONTH PERIOD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN IS MEASURED AS THE DISCOUNT THE EMPLOYEE IS ENTITLED TO UPON PURCHASE AND IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD OF PURCHASE.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL INCOME TAXES, THE PROVISION FOR U.S. TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES NOT DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY INVESTED, AND INTEREST AND PENALTIES ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. CERTAIN INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE

NOT REPORTED IN TAX RETURNS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE SAME YEAR. THE TAX EFFECT OF SUCH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IS REPORTED AS DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REPORTED NET OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. THE DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT OR LONG-TERM BASED ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE RELATED ASSET OR LIABILITY.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

WE ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE HIERARCHY BELOW LISTS THREE LEVELS OF FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE

MARKET. WE CATEGORIZE EACH OF OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS IN ONE OF THESE THREE LEVELS BASED ON THE LOWEST LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THESE LEVELS ARE.



LEVEL 1

 INPUTS ARE BASED UPON UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS. OUR LEVEL 1 NON-DERIVATIVE

INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND ACTIVELY TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS. OUR LEVEL 1 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDE THOSE ACTIVELY TRADED ON EXCHANGES.

LEVEL 2

 INPUTS ARE BASED UPON QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN

MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, AND MODEL-BASED VALUATION TECHNIQUES (E.G. THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL) FOR WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. WHERE APPLICABLE, THESE MODELS PROJECT FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNT THE FUTURE AMOUNTS TO A PRESENT VALUE USING MARKET-BASED OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE CURVES, CREDIT SPREADS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, AND

FORWARD AND SPOT PRICES FOR CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES. OUR LEVEL 2 NON-DERIVATIVE INVESTMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, U.S. AGENCY SECURITIES, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BONDS.

OUR LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CERTAIN OVER-THE-COUNTER OPTION AND SWAP CONTRACTS.



LEVEL 3

 INPUTS ARE GENERALLY UNOBSERVABLE AND TYPICALLY REFLECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN

PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. THE FAIR VALUES ARE THEREFORE DETERMINED USING MODEL-BASED TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING OPTION PRICING MODELS AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS. OUR LEVEL 3 ASSETS PRIMARILY COMPRISE INVESTMENTS IN CERTAIN CORPORATE BONDS AND

GOODWILL WHEN IT IS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE DUE TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. WE VALUE THE LEVEL 3 CORPORATE BONDS USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED VALUATION MODELS, INPUTS TO WHICH INCLUDE INTEREST RATE CURVES, CREDIT SPREADS, STOCK PRICES, AND

VOLATILITIES. IN CERTAIN CASES, MARKET-BASED OBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE NOT AVAILABLE AND WE USE MANAGEMENT JUDGMENT TO DEVELOP ASSUMPTIONS TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE FOR THESE DERIVATIVES. UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN ALL OF THESE MODELS ARE SIGNIFICANT TO

THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

WE MEASURE CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR COST AND EQUITY METHOD

INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE DETERMINED BASED ON VALUATION TECHNIQUES USING THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE, AND MAY INCLUDE

QUOTED MARKET PRICES, MARKET COMPARABLES, AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED WHEN THE COST OF THE INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE AND THIS CONDITION IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

OUR OTHER CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS AND OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL LIABILITIES HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUES.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL

HIGHLY LIQUID INTEREST-EARNING INVESTMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUES. IN GENERAL, INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL

MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES BEYOND ONE YEAR MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM BASED ON THEIR HIGHLY LIQUID NATURE AND

BECAUSE SUCH MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT THE INVESTMENT OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. ALL CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED USING THE

SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE, EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, ARE REFLECTED IN OCI.

EQUITY AND

OTHER INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM INCLUDE BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. DEBT AND PUBLICLY-TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED USING THE

SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE, EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, ARE REFLECTED IN OCI. COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK AND OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE RESTRICTED FOR

MORE THAN ONE YEAR OR ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRADED ARE RECORDED AT COST OR USING THE EQUITY METHOD.

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY

SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BASED UPON

THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY.

INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED BASED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MARKET INFORMATION OR OTHER ESTIMATES DETERMINED BY

MANAGEMENT. WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE

EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO SELL, THE

INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO

THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY,

AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED.

DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON THE INTENDED USE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND THE RESULTING DESIGNATION.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS FAIR-VALUE HEDGES, THE GAINS (LOSSES) ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIODS OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH

THE OFFSETTING LOSSES (GAINS) ON THE HEDGED ITEMS ATTRIBUTED TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS FAIR-VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAINS (LOSSES) ON THE DERIVATIVES IS INITIALLY

REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED EXPOSURE IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE

EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. GAINS (LOSSES) ON DERIVATIVES REPRESENTING EITHER HEDGE COMPONENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS OR HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES, GAINS (LOSSES) FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES ARE PRIMARILY RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME

(EXPENSE). OTHER THAN THOSE DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO FOR INVESTMENT PURPOSES, SUCH AS COMMODITY CONTRACTS, THE GAINS (LOSSES) ARE GENERALLY ECONOMICALLY OFFSET BY UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) IN THE UNDERLYING AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE

RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI UNTIL THE SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, AT WHICH TIME THE AMOUNTS ARE RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) INTO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST, SUBJECT TO THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. COST INCLUDES MATERIALS, LABOR, AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD RELATED

TO THE PURCHASE AND PRODUCTION OF INVENTORIES. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVENTORY QUANTITIES ON HAND, FUTURE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, AND THE ESTIMATED UTILITY OF OUR INVENTORY. IF OUR REVIEW INDICATES A REDUCTION IN UTILITY BELOW

CARRYING VALUE, WE REDUCE OUR INVENTORY TO A NEW COST BASIS THROUGH A CHARGE TO COST OF REVENUE.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IS STATED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE SHORTER OF THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET

OR THE LEASE TERM. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF OUR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE GENERALLY AS FOLLOWS: COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR ACQUIRED FOR INTERNAL USE, THREE YEARS; COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, TWO TO THREE YEARS; BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS, FIVE TO

15 YEARS; LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, TWO TO 10 YEARS; AND FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT, ONE TO FIVE YEARS. LAND IS NOT DEPRECIATED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1

FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ALL OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION AND ARE AMORTIZED

USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR ESTIMATED PERIOD OF BENEFIT, RANGING FROM ONE TO 15 YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS PERIODICALLY BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY WARRANT REVISED ESTIMATES

OF USEFUL LIVES OR THAT INDICATE THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

IN SEPTEMBER 2011, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE ON TESTING GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT. THE NEW GUIDANCE PROVIDES AN ENTITY THE OPTION TO FIRST PERFORM A QUALITATIVE ASSESSMENT TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING

UNIT IS LESS THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT. IF AN ENTITY DETERMINES THAT THIS IS THE CASE, IT IS REQUIRED TO PERFORM THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST TO IDENTIFY POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AND MEASURE THE AMOUNT OF GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT LOSS TO BE

RECOGNIZED FOR THAT REPORTING UNIT (IF ANY). IF AN ENTITY DETERMINES THAT THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT IS GREATER THAN ITS CARRYING AMOUNT, THE TWO-STEP GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST IS NOT REQUIRED. WE ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE BEGINNING

JULY 1, 2012. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE DID NOT HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

IN JUNE 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON PRESENTATION OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME. THE NEW

GUIDANCE ELIMINATED THE OPTION TO REPORT OCI AND ITS COMPONENTS IN THE STATEMENT OF CHANGES IN STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY. INSTEAD, AN ENTITY IS REQUIRED TO PRESENT EITHER A CONTINUOUS STATEMENT OF NET INCOME AND OCI OR IN TWO SEPARATE BUT

CONSECUTIVE STATEMENTS. WE ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE BEGINNING JULY 1, 2012. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE RESULTED ONLY IN CHANGES TO PRESENTATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE NOT YET ADOPTED

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE

ENHANCING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE NATURE OF AN ENTITYS RIGHT TO OFFSET AND RELATED ARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF THE GROSS AMOUNTS

SUBJECT TO RIGHTS OF SET-OFF, AMOUNTS OFFSET IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOLLOWED, AND THE RELATED NET EXPOSURE. IN JANUARY 2013, THE FASB CLARIFIED THAT THE SCOPE OF THIS GUIDANCE APPLIES TO DERIVATIVES, INCLUDING BIFURCATED

EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES, REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS AND REVERSE REPURCHASE AGREEMENTS, AND SECURITIES BORROWING AND SECURITIES LENDING TRANSACTIONS THAT ARE EITHER OFFSET OR SUBJECT TO AN ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT, OR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS. THE

NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. OTHER THAN REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.

IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR ITEMS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF AOCI. THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES ENTITIES TO

PRESENT (EITHER ON THE FACE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT OR IN THE NOTES) THE EFFECTS ON THE LINE ITEMS OF THE INCOME STATEMENT FOR AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF AOCI. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. OTHER THAN

REQUIRING ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES, WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.

IN MARCH 2013, THE

FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON A PARENTS ACCOUNTING FOR THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT UPON DERECOGNITION OF A SUBSIDIARY OR GROUP OF ASSETS WITHIN A FOREIGN ENTITY. THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT THE PARENT RELEASE ANY RELATED CUMULATIVE

TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT INTO NET INCOME ONLY IF THE SALE OR TRANSFER RESULTS IN THE COMPLETE OR SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE LIQUIDATION OF THE FOREIGN ENTITY IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OR GROUP OF ASSETS HAD RESIDED. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US

BEGINNING JULY 1, 2014. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.

NOTE 2  EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EPS IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PLUS THE EFFECT OF DILUTIVE POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. DILUTIVE

POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES INCLUDE OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS, STOCK AWARDS, AND SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS.

NOTE 5  DERIVATIVES

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND CREDIT; TO

ENHANCE INVESTMENT RETURNS; AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. OUR OBJECTIVES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVES INCLUDE REDUCING, ELIMINATING, AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THESE EXPOSURES AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE.

OUR DERIVATIVE PROGRAMS INCLUDE STRATEGIES THAT BOTH QUALIFY AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. ALL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS PRESENTED

BELOW ARE MEASURED IN U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE

POSITIONS. OPTION AND FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INTERNATIONAL REVENUE FOR UP TO THREE YEARS IN THE FUTURE AND ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE

YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013 AND JUNE 30, 2012, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS SOLD WERE $5.1 BILLION AND $6.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS RELATED TO CERTAIN NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES ARE HEDGED USING FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE

DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013 AND JUNE 30, 2012, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS SOLD WERE $407 MILLION AND $1.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CERTAIN OPTIONS AND FORWARDS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO USED TO MANAGE THE VARIABILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES ON ACCOUNTS

RECEIVABLE, CASH, AND INTERCOMPANY POSITIONS, AND TO MANAGE OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $5.0 BILLION AND $7.9 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $3.6 BILLION AND $7.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

EQUITY

SECURITIES HELD IN OUR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET

PRICE RISK. MARKET PRICE RISK IS MANAGED RELATIVE TO BROAD-BASED GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC EQUITY INDICES USING CERTAIN CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED INVESTMENTS, OPTIONS, FUTURES, AND SWAP CONTRACTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME,

TO HEDGE OUR PRICE RISK, WE MAY USE AND DESIGNATE EQUITY DERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING PUTS, CALLS, SWAPS, AND FORWARDS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED EQUITY CONTRACTS

63

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $898 MILLION AND $1.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF DESIGNATED AND NON-DESIGNATED EQUITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE

$1.4 BILLION AND $982 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

INTEREST RATE

SECURITIES HELD IN OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTEREST RATE RISKS BASED ON THEIR MATURITIES. WE MANAGE THE AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT

CORRELATE TO CERTAIN BROAD-BASED FIXED-INCOME INDICES USING EXCHANGE-TRADED OPTION AND FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OVER-THE-COUNTER SWAP AND OPTION CONTRACTS, NONE OF WHICH ARE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE TOTAL

NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF FIXED-INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.1 BILLION AND $809 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF FIXED-INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $3.2 BILLION AND

$1.9 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION, WE USE TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS TO

GAIN EXPOSURE TO AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. THESE MEET THE DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IN CASES WHERE PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE ASSETS IS NOT TAKEN AT THE EARLIEST AVAILABLE DELIVERY DATE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013 AND 2012, THE

TOTAL NOTIONAL DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS OF MORTGAGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED WERE $1.2 BILLION AND $1.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. WE USE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP CONTRACTS, NOT

DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO MANAGE CREDIT EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO BROAD-BASED INDICES AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. WE USE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS AS THEY ARE A LOW COST METHOD OF MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISKS OR

GROUPS OF CREDIT RISKS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $377 MILLION AND $501 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT CONTRACTS PURCHASED

AND SOLD WERE $318 MILLION AND $456 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

COMMODITY

WE USE BROAD-BASED COMMODITY EXPOSURES TO ENHANCE PORTFOLIO RETURNS AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. WE USE SWAPS, FUTURES, AND OPTION CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO GENERATE AND

MANAGE EXPOSURES TO BROAD-BASED COMMODITY INDICES. WE USE DERIVATIVES ON COMMODITIES AS THEY CAN BE LOW-COST ALTERNATIVES TO THE PURCHASE AND STORAGE OF A VARIETY OF COMMODITIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRECIOUS METALS, ENERGY, AND GRAIN. AS

OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF COMMODITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.2 BILLION AND $249 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2012, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF COMMODITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.5

BILLION AND $445 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

CERTAIN OF OUR COUNTERPARTY AGREEMENTS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM UNSECURED

DEBT TO MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING AND REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM LIQUIDITY OF $1.0 BILLION. TO THE EXTENT WE FAIL TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL, SIMILAR TO THE STANDARD CONVENTION RELATED TO

OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, OUR LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT RATING WAS AAA, AND CASH INVESTMENTS WERE IN EXCESS OF $1.0 BILLION. AS A RESULT, NO COLLATERAL WAS REQUIRED TO BE POSTED.

YAMMER

ON JULY 18,

2012, WE ACQUIRED YAMMER, INC. (YAMMER), A LEADING PROVIDER OF ENTERPRISE SOCIAL NETWORKS, FOR $1.1 BILLION IN CASH. YAMMER WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ITS STANDALONE SERVICE AND WILL ADD AN ENTERPRISE SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICE TO

MICROSOFTS PORTFOLIO OF COMPLEMENTARY CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. THE MAJOR CLASSES OF ASSETS TO WHICH WE ALLOCATED THE PURCHASE PRICE WERE GOODWILL OF $937 MILLION AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $178 MILLION. WE ASSIGNED THE GOODWILL TO THE

MICROSOFT BUSINESS DIVISION. YAMMER WAS CONSOLIDATED INTO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS STARTING ON THE ACQUISITION DATE.

SKYPE

ON OCTOBER 13, 2011, WE ACQUIRED ALL OF THE ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING SHARES OF SKYPE GLOBAL S.Á R.L. (SKYPE), A LEADING

GLOBAL PROVIDER OF SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND RELATED INTERNET COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS BASED IN LUXEMBOURG, FOR $8.6 BILLION, PRIMARILY IN CASH. THE MAJOR CLASSES OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO WHICH WE ALLOCATED THE PURCHASE PRICE WERE GOODWILL OF

$7.1 BILLION, IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $1.6 BILLION, AND UNEARNED REVENUE OF $222 MILLION. THE GOODWILL RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR EXPECTATION OF EXTENDING SKYPES BRAND AND THE REACH

OF ITS NETWORKED PLATFORM, WHILE ENHANCING MICROSOFTS EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF REAL-TIME COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE ASSIGNED THE GOODWILL TO THE FOLLOWING SEGMENTS: $4.2 BILLION TO ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION, $2.8 BILLION TO

MICROSOFT BUSINESS DIVISION, AND $54 MILLION TO ONLINE SERVICES DIVISION. SKYPE WAS CONSOLIDATED INTO OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS STARTING ON THE ACQUISITION DATE.

THE MEASUREMENT PERIODS FOR PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS END AS SOON AS INFORMATION ON THE FACTS AND

CIRCUMSTANCES BECOMES AVAILABLE, BUT DO NOT EXCEED 12 MONTHS. ADJUSTMENTS IN PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATIONS MAY REQUIRE A RECASTING OF THE AMOUNTS ALLOCATED TO GOODWILL RETROACTIVE TO THE PERIODS IN WHICH THE ACQUISITIONS OCCURRED.

ANY CHANGE IN THE GOODWILL AMOUNTS RESULTING FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATIONS ARE PRESENTED AS OTHER IN THE ABOVE TABLE. ALSO

INCLUDED WITHIN OTHER ARE BUSINESS DISPOSITIONS AND TRANSFERS BETWEEN BUSINESS SEGMENTS DUE TO REORGANIZATIONS, AS APPLICABLE. FOR FISCAL YEAR 2012, A $6.2 BILLION GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE WAS INCLUDED IN OTHER, AS

DISCUSSED FURTHER BELOW. THIS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE ALSO REPRESENTED OUR ACCUMULATED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AS OF JUNE 30, 2013 AND 2012.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR

IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY ON MAY 1 AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY WITH A PEER-BASED, RISK-ADJUSTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. WE BELIEVE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW APPROACH IS THE MOST RELIABLE

INDICATOR OF THE FAIR VALUES OF THE BUSINESSES.

NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL WAS IDENTIFIED AS OF MAY 1, 2013. UPON COMPLETION OF THE

FISCAL YEAR 2012 TEST, OSD GOODWILL WAS DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED. THE IMPAIRMENT WAS THE RESULT OF THE OSD UNIT EXPERIENCING SLOWER THAN PROJECTED GROWTH IN SEARCH QUERIES AND SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE PER QUERY, SLOWER GROWTH IN DISPLAY REVENUE,

AND CHANGES IN THE TIMING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CERTAIN INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO DRIVE SEARCH AND DISPLAY REVENUE GROWTH IN THE FUTURE.

BECAUSE OUR FISCAL YEAR 2012 ANNUAL TEST INDICATED THAT OSDS CARRYING VALUE EXCEEDED ITS ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE, A SECOND PHASE OF THE GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT TEST (STEP 2) WAS PERFORMED SPECIFIC TO OSD. UNDER STEP 2, THE FAIR VALUE OF ALL OSD ASSETS AND LIABILITIES WERE ESTIMATED, INCLUDING TANGIBLE ASSETS, EXISTING TECHNOLOGY, TRADE NAMES, AND PARTNER RELATIONSHIPS FOR THE PURPOSE

OF DERIVING AN ESTIMATE OF THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF GOODWILL. THE IMPLIED FAIR VALUE OF THE GOODWILL WAS THEN COMPARED TO THE RECORDED GOODWILL TO DETERMINE THE AMOUNT OF THE IMPAIRMENT. ASSUMPTIONS USED IN MEASURING THE VALUE OF THESE ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES INCLUDED THE DISCOUNT RATES, ROYALTY RATES, AND OBSOLESCENCE RATES USED IN VALUING THE INTANGIBLE ASSETS, AND PRICING OF COMPARABLE TRANSACTIONS IN THE MARKET IN VALUING THE TANGIBLE ASSETS.

NO OTHER INSTANCES OF IMPAIRMENT WERE IDENTIFIED IN OUR MAY 1, 2012 TEST.

THE UNRECOGNIZED DEFERRED TAX LIABILITY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES WAS APPROXIMATELY $24.4 BILLION AT JUNE 30, 2013.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REACHED A SETTLEMENT OF A PORTION OF AN I.R.S. AUDIT OF TAX YEARS

2004 TO 2006, WHICH REDUCED OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE BY $461 MILLION. WHILE WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S. AUDIT, WE REMAIN UNDER AUDIT FOR THESE YEARS. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE I.R.S. WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS REPORT AND REOPENED THE AUDIT

PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING, WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE BELIEVE OUR ALLOWANCES FOR TAX

CONTINGENCIES ARE APPROPRIATE. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS, BECAUSE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE REMAINING OPEN ISSUES WILL

BE RESOLVED WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2012.

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR OPERATIONS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR TAX YEARS 1996 TO 2012, SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES. THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE

AUDITS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

WE PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS OF VARYING SCOPE AND SIZE TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AGAINST CLAIMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT MADE BY THIRD PARTIES ARISING FROM THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS.

WE EVALUATE ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, AND WE CONSIDER SUCH FACTORS AS THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED

SIGNIFICANT COSTS AS A RESULT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS AND HAVE NOT ACCRUED ANY LIABILITIES RELATED TO THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOTE 17  CONTINGENCIES

ANTITRUST, UNFAIR COMPETITION, AND OVERCHARGE CLASS ACTIONS

A LARGE NUMBER OF ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST US IN VARIOUS STATE, FEDERAL, AND CANADIAN COURTS ON BEHALF OF VARIOUS CLASSES OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT PURCHASERS OF OUR PC

OPERATING SYSTEM AND CERTAIN OTHER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS BETWEEN 1999 AND 2005. WE OBTAINED DISMISSALS OR REACHED SETTLEMENTS OF ALL CLAIMS MADE IN THE UNITED STATES.

ALL SETTLEMENTS IN THE UNITED STATES HAVE RECEIVED FINAL COURT APPROVAL. UNDER THE SETTLEMENTS, GENERALLY CLASS MEMBERS CAN OBTAIN VOUCHERS THAT ENTITLE THEM TO BE REIMBURSED FOR PURCHASES OF A WIDE VARIETY OF

PLATFORM-NEUTRAL COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. THE TOTAL VALUE OF VOUCHERS WE MAY ISSUE VARIES BY STATE. WE WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN SCHOOLS A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE VOUCHERS THAT ARE NOT ISSUED OR CLAIMED (ONE-HALF TO TWO-THIRDS DEPENDING ON

THE STATE). THE TOTAL VALUE OF VOUCHERS WE ULTIMATELY ISSUE WILL DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBERS WHO MAKE CLAIMS AND ARE ISSUED VOUCHERS. THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF VOUCHERS TO BE ISSUED IS APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION. THE ACTUAL COSTS OF THESE

SETTLEMENTS WILL BE LESS THAN THAT MAXIMUM AMOUNT, DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBERS AND SCHOOLS THAT ARE ISSUED AND REDEEM VOUCHERS. WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL COST TO RESOLVE ALL OF THE STATE OVERCHARGE CLASS ACTION CASES WILL RANGE BETWEEN $1.9

BILLION AND $2.0 BILLION. AT JUNE 30, 2013, WE HAVE RECORDED A LIABILITY RELATED TO THESE CLAIMS OF APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION, WHICH REFLECTS OUR ESTIMATED EXPOSURE OF $1.9 BILLION LESS PAYMENTS MADE TO DATE OF APPROXIMATELY $1.4 BILLION

MOSTLY FOR VOUCHERS, LEGAL FEES, AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES.

THE THREE CASES PENDING IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, ONTARIO, AND QUEBEC, CANADA

HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED. IN MARCH 2010, THE COURT IN THE BRITISH COLUMBIA CASE CERTIFIED IT AS A CLASS ACTION. IN APRIL 2011, THE BRITISH COLUMBIA COURT OF APPEAL REVERSED THE CLASS CERTIFICATION RULING AND DISMISSED THE CASE, HOLDING THAT

INDIRECT PURCHASERS DO NOT HAVE A CLAIM. THE PLAINTIFFS HAVE FILED AN APPEAL TO THE CANADIAN SUPREME COURT, WHICH WAS HEARD IN THE FALL OF 2012. THE OTHER TWO ACTIONS HAVE BEEN STAYED.

OTHER ANTITRUST LITIGATION AND CLAIMS

IN NOVEMBER 2004, NOVELL, INC. (NOVELL)

FILED A COMPLAINT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH (LATER TRANSFERRED TO FEDERAL COURT IN MARYLAND), ASSERTING ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLAIMS AGAINST US RELATED TO NOVELLS OWNERSHIP OF WORDPERFECT AND OTHER PRODUCTIVITY

APPLICATIONS DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN JUNE 1994 AND MARCH 1996. IN JUNE 2005, THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED OUR MOTION TO DISMISS FOUR OF NOVELLS SIX CLAIMS. IN MARCH 2010, THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MICROSOFT AS TO

ALL REMAINING CLAIMS. THE COURT OF APPEALS REVERSED THAT RULING AS TO ONE CLAIM. TRIAL OF THAT CLAIM TOOK PLACE FROM OCTOBER TO DECEMBER 2011 AND RESULTED IN A MISTRIAL BECAUSE THE JURY WAS UNABLE TO REACH A VERDICT. IN JULY 2012, THE TRIAL COURT

GRANTED MICROSOFTS MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW. NOVELL HAS APPEALED THIS DECISION TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT, WHICH HEARD ORAL ARGUMENTS IN MAY 2013.

PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS

MOTOROLA LITIGATION

IN OCTOBER 2010, MICROSOFT FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT COMPLAINTS AGAINST MOTOROLA MOBILITY (MOTOROLA) WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE

COMMISSION (ITC) AND IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE FOR INFRINGEMENT OF NINE MICROSOFT PATENTS

BY MOTOROLAS ANDROID DEVICES. SINCE THEN, MICROSOFT AND MOTOROLA HAVE FILED ADDITIONAL CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER IN THE ITC, IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURTS IN SEATTLE, WISCONSIN, FLORIDA, AND

CALIFORNIA, AND IN COURTS IN GERMANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. IN APRIL 2012, FOLLOWING COMPLAINTS BY MICROSOFT AND APPLE, THE EUROPEAN UNIONS COMPETITION OFFICE OPENED TWO ANTITRUST INVESTIGATIONS AGAINST MOTOROLA TO DETERMINE WHETHER IT HAS

ABUSED CERTAIN OF ITS STANDARD ESSENTIAL PATENTS TO DISTORT COMPETITION IN BREACH OF EUROPEAN UNION ANTITRUST RULES. IN JUNE 2012, WE RECEIVED A REQUEST FOR INFORMATION FROM THE U.S. FEDERAL TRADE COMMISSION (FTC) APPARENTLY RELATED TO

AN FTC INVESTIGATION INTO WHETHER MOTOROLAS CONDUCT VIOLATES U.S. LAW. THE NATURE OF THE CLAIMS ASSERTED AND STATUS OF INDIVIDUAL MATTERS ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION

THE HEARING IN MICROSOFTS ITC CASE AGAINST MOTOROLA TOOK

PLACE IN AUGUST 2011 ON SEVEN OF THE NINE PATENTS ORIGINALLY ASSERTED IN THE COMPLAINT. IN DECEMBER 2011, THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE (ALJ) ISSUED AN INITIAL DETERMINATION THAT MOTOROLA INFRINGED ONE MICROSOFT PATENT, AND RECOMMENDED

THAT THE ITC ISSUE A LIMITED EXCLUSION ORDER AGAINST MOTOROLA PROHIBITING IMPORTATION OF INFRINGING MOTOROLA ANDROID DEVICES. IN MAY 2012, THE ITC ISSUED THE LIMITED EXCLUSION ORDER RECOMMENDED BY THE ALJ, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE ON JULY 18,

2012. MICROSOFT HAS APPEALED CERTAIN ASPECTS OF THE ITC RULING ADVERSE TO MICROSOFT AND MOTOROLA HAS APPEALED THE ITC EXCLUSION ORDER TO THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT. IN ADDITION, IN JULY 2013, MICROSOFT FILED AN ACTION IN U.S.

DISTRICT COURT IN WASHINGTON, D.C. SEEKING AN ORDER TO COMPEL ENFORCEMENT OF THE ITCS MAY 2012 IMPORT BAN AGAINST INFRINGING MOTOROLA PRODUCTS BY THE BUREAU OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION (CBP), AFTER LEARNING THAT CBP HAD FAILED

TO FULLY ENFORCE THE ORDER.

IN NOVEMBER 2010, MOTOROLA FILED AN ACTION AGAINST MICROSOFT IN THE ITC ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF FIVE

MOTOROLA PATENTS BY XBOX CONSOLES AND ACCESSORIES AND SEEKING AN EXCLUSION ORDER TO PROHIBIT IMPORTATION OF THE ALLEGEDLY INFRINGING XBOX PRODUCTS INTO THE U.S. IN APRIL 2012, THE ALJ FOUND THAT XBOX PRODUCTS INFRINGE FOUR OF THE FIVE PATENTS

ASSERTED BY MOTOROLA. THE ALJ RECOMMENDED THAT THE ITC ISSUE A LIMITED EXCLUSION ORDER AND A CEASE AND DESIST ORDER. BOTH MICROSOFT AND MOTOROLA SOUGHT ITC REVIEW OF THE ALJS FINDINGS. IN JUNE 2012, MICROSOFT FILED A MOTION TO TERMINATE THE

INVESTIGATION AS TO CERTAIN PATENTS BASED ON FACTS ARISING AS THE RESULT OF GOOGLES ACQUISITION OF MOTOROLA. THE ITC DETERMINED THAT IT WOULD REVIEW THE ALJS INITIAL DETERMINATION IN ITS ENTIRETY AND REMANDED THE MATTER TO THE ALJ

(1) TO APPLY CERTAIN ITC CASE PRECEDENT, (2) TO RULE ON MICROSOFTS JUNE 2012 MOTION TO TERMINATE, AND (3) SET A NEW TARGET DATE FOR COMPLETION OF THE INVESTIGATION. THE ALJ HELD A HEARING IN DECEMBER 2012 AND SET A TARGET

DATE FOR A FINAL ITC RULING IN JULY 2013. AT MOTOROLAS REQUEST, THE ITC TERMINATED ITS INVESTIGATION AS TO FOUR MOTOROLA PATENTS, LEAVING ONLY ONE MOTOROLA PATENT AT ISSUE BEFORE THE ITC. IN MARCH 2013, THE ALJ RULED THAT THERE HAS BEEN NO

VIOLATION AS TO THE REMAINING MOTOROLA PATENT. MOTOROLA SOUGHT ITC REVIEW OF THE ALJS DETERMINATION, WHICH THE ITC DENIED IN MAY 2013.

U.S.

DISTRICT COURT

THE SEATTLE DISTRICT COURT CASE FILED IN OCTOBER 2010 BY MICROSOFT AS A COMPANION TO MICROSOFTS ITC CASE

AGAINST MOTOROLA HAS BEEN STAYED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF MICROSOFTS ITC CASE.

IN NOVEMBER 2010, MICROSOFT SUED MOTOROLA FOR BREACH

OF CONTRACT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE, ALLEGING THAT MOTOROLA BREACHED ITS COMMITMENTS TO STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS TO LICENSE TO MICROSOFT CERTAIN PATENTS ON REASONABLE AND NON-DISCRIMINATORY (RAND) TERMS AND CONDITIONS.

MOTOROLA HAS DECLARED THESE PATENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE H.264 VIDEO STANDARD AND THE 802.11 WI-FI STANDARD. IN SUITS DESCRIBED BELOW, MOTOROLA OR A MOTOROLA AFFILIATE SUBSEQUENTLY SUED MICROSOFT ON THOSE PATENTS IN U.S. DISTRICT

COURTS, IN THE ITC, AND IN GERMANY. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE SEATTLE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED A PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MICROSOFT RULING THAT (1) MOTOROLA ENTERED INTO BINDING CONTRACTUAL COMMITMENTS WITH STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS

COMMITTING TO LICENSE ITS DECLARED-ESSENTIAL PATENTS ON RAND TERMS AND CONDITIONS; AND (2) MICROSOFT IS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF THOSE COMMITMENTS. THE COURT REJECTED MOTOROLAS ARGUMENT THAT MICROSOFT HAD REPUDIATED ITS RIGHT TO A

RAND LICENSE, AND RULED A TRIAL IS NEEDED TO DETERMINE WHETHER MOTOROLA IS IN BREACH OF ITS OBLIGATION TO ENTER INTO A PATENT LICENSE WITH MICROSOFT AND, IF SO, THE AMOUNT OF THE RAND ROYALTY. IN APRIL 2012, THE COURT ISSUED A TEMPORARY RESTRAINING

ORDER PREVENTING MOTOROLA FROM TAKING STEPS TO ENFORCE AN INJUNCTION IN GERMANY RELATING TO THE H.264 VIDEO PATENTS. IN MAY 2012, THE COURT CONVERTED THAT ORDER INTO A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION. MOTOROLA APPEALED THE COURTS INJUNCTION

ORDERS TO THE COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE NINTH CIRCUIT, WHICH AFFIRMED THE ORDERS IN SEPTEMBER 2012. THE SEATTLE DISTRICT COURT HELD A TRIAL IN NOVEMBER 2012 TO DETERMINE THE RAND ROYALTY FOR

MOTOROLAS H.264 AND 802.11 PATENTS. IN DECEMBER 2012, THE SEATTLE DISTRICT COURT RULED THAT MOTOROLA COULD NOT OBTAIN INJUNCTIVE RELIEF IN CONNECTION WITH ANY OF ITS CLAIMS FOR INFRINGEMENT OF ITS H.264 AND 802.11 PATENTS. IN APRIL 2013, THE

COURT SET PER UNIT ROYALTIES FOR MOTOROLAS H.264 AND 802.11 PATENTS, WHICH RESULTED IN AN IMMATERIAL MICROSOFT LIABILITY. TRIAL OF MICROSOFTS BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM IS SET FOR AUGUST 26, 2013.

CASES FILED BY MOTOROLA IN WISCONSIN, CALIFORNIA, AND FLORIDA, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE CURRENTLY STAYED CASE IN WISCONSIN (A COMPANION CASE TO

MOTOROLAS ITC ACTION), HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE U.S DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE. MOTOROLA AND MICROSOFT BOTH SEEK DAMAGES AS WELL AS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. NO TRIAL DATES HAVE BEEN SET IN ANY OF THE TRANSFERRED CASES, AND THE COURT HAS STAYED

THESE CASES ON AGREEMENT OF THE PARTIES.

IN JULY 2011, MOTOROLA FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT ACTIONS IN GERMANY AGAINST MICROSOFT AND SEVERAL MICROSOFT SUBSIDIARIES.



TWO OF THE PATENTS ARE ASSERTED BY MOTOROLA TO BE ESSENTIAL TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE H.264 VIDEO STANDARD, AND MOTOROLA ALLEGES THAT H.264 CAPABLE PRODUCTS

INCLUDING XBOX 360, WINDOWS 7, MEDIA PLAYER, AND INTERNET EXPLORER INFRINGE THOSE PATENTS. MOTOROLA SEEKS DAMAGES AND AN INJUNCTION. IN MAY 2012, THE COURT ISSUED AN INJUNCTION RELATING TO ALL H.264 CAPABLE MICROSOFT PRODUCTS IN GERMANY. HOWEVER,

DUE TO ORDERS IN THE SEPARATE LITIGATION PENDING IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON DESCRIBED ABOVE, MOTOROLA IS ENJOINED FROM TAKING STEPS TO ENFORCE THE GERMAN INJUNCTION. DAMAGES WOULD BE DETERMINED IN LATER PROCEEDINGS. MICROSOFT HAS APPEALED THE RULINGS OF

THE FIRST INSTANCE COURT.



MOTOROLA ASSERTS ONE OF THE PATENTS COVERS CERTAIN SYNCING FUNCTIONALITY IN THE ACTIVESYNC PROTOCOL EMPLOYED BY WINDOWS PHONE 7, OUTLOOK MOBILE, HOTMAIL

MOBILE, EXCHANGE ONLINE, EXCHANGE SERVER, AND HOTMAIL SERVER. MOTOROLA SEEKS DAMAGES AND AN INJUNCTION. IN APRIL 2013, THE COURT STAYED THE CASE PENDING THE OUTCOME OF PARALLEL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH MICROSOFT IS SEEKING TO INVALIDATE THE PATENT.



SHOULD AN INJUNCTION ORDER BE ISSUED AND ENFORCED BY MOTOROLA, MICROSOFT MAY BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACT BY ALTERING ITS PRODUCTS TO AVOID

MOTOROLAS INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.

IN LAWSUITS MICROSOFT FILED IN GERMANY IN SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER, AND DECEMBER 2011

AND IN APRIL 2012, MICROSOFT ASSERTS MOTOROLA ANDROID DEVICES INFRINGE MICROSOFT PATENTS. MICROSOFT SEEKS DAMAGES AND AN INJUNCTION. IN MAY, JULY, AND SEPTEMBER 2012, COURTS IN GERMANY ISSUED INJUNCTIONS ON THREE PATENTS AGAINST MOTOROLA ANDROID

DEVICES AND IN MAY AND JULY RULED AGAINST MICROSOFT ON TWO PATENTS. MICROSOFT IS TAKING STEPS TO ENFORCE THE INJUNCTIONS. DAMAGES WILL BE DETERMINED IN LATER PROCEEDINGS. EACH PARTY HAS APPEALED OR IS EXPECTED TO APPEAL THE RULINGS AGAINST IT.

MOTOROLA IS ALSO SEEKING TO INVALIDATE MICROSOFTS PATENTS IN PARALLEL COURT PROCEEDINGS.

UNITED KINGDOM

IN DECEMBER 2011, MICROSOFT FILED AN ACTION AGAINST MOTOROLA IN THE HIGH COURT OF JUSTICE, CHANCERY DIVISION, PATENTS COURT, IN LONDON, ENGLAND,

SEEKING TO REVOKE THE UK PART OF THE EUROPEAN PATENT ASSERTED BY MOTOROLA IN GERMANY AGAINST THE ACTIVESYNC PROTOCOL. IN FEBRUARY 2012, MOTOROLA COUNTERCLAIMED ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF THE

ITEM 8

PATENT AND SEEKING DAMAGES AND AN INJUNCTION. A TRIAL TOOK PLACE IN DECEMBER 2012, AND THE COURT RULED THAT MOTOROLAS PATENT IS INVALID AND REVOKED. THE COURT ALSO RULED THAT THE PATENT,

EVEN IF VALID, WOULD BE LICENSED UNDER THE GRANT-BACK CLAUSE IN GOOGLES ACTIVESYNC LICENSE. MOTOROLA HAS APPEALED.

OTHER PATENT AND

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS

IN ADDITION TO THESE CASES, THERE ARE APPROXIMATELY 65 OTHER PATENT INFRINGEMENT CASES PENDING AGAINST

MICROSOFT.

OTHER

WE ALSO ARE

SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF OTHER CLAIMS AND SUITS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT RESOLVING CLAIMS AGAINST US, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL

ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THESE MATTERS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, WE HAD ACCRUED AGGREGATE LIABILITIES OF $412 MILLION IN OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES AND $162 MILLION IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES FOR ALL OF OUR LEGAL MATTERS THAT WERE CONTINGENCIES AS OF

THAT DATE. WHILE WE INTEND TO DEFEND THESE MATTERS VIGOROUSLY, ADVERSE OUTCOMES THAT WE ESTIMATE COULD REACH APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION IN AGGREGATE BEYOND RECORDED AMOUNTS ARE REASONABLY POSSIBLE. WERE UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOMES TO OCCUR, THERE

EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECTS BECOME REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

STOCK AWARDS

STOCK AWARDS

(SAS) ARE GRANTS THAT ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO SHARES OF MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK AS THE AWARD VESTS. SAS GENERALLY VEST OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.

LEADERSHIP STOCK AWARDS

LEADERSHIP STOCK

AWARDS (LSAS) ARE A FORM OF SAS IN WHICH THE NUMBER OF SHARES ULTIMATELY RECEIVED DEPENDS ON OUR BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AGAINST SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE METRICS. LSAS REPLACED SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS (SPSA) IN FISCAL YEAR

2013. SHARES PREVIOUSLY ISSUED UNDER THE SPSA PROGRAM WILL CONTINUE TO VEST RATABLY UNDER THEIR ORIGINAL TERM, GENERALLY WITH A THREE-YEAR REMAINING SERVICE PERIOD.

A BASE NUMBER OF LSAS ARE GRANTED IN EACH FISCAL YEAR, WHICH REPRESENTS THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD FOR THE AWARDS. FOLLOWING THE END OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE NUMBER OF SHARES CAN BE INCREASED BY 25% IF CERTAIN

PERFORMANCE METRICS ARE MET. ONE QUARTER OF THE AWARDED SHARES WILL VEST ONE YEAR AFTER THE GRANT DATE. THE REMAINING SHARES WILL VEST SEMI-ANNUALLY DURING THE FOLLOWING THREE YEARS.

EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE PLAN

UNDER THE EXECUTIVE INCENTIVE PLAN (EIP), THE

COMPENSATION COMMITTEE AWARDS PERFORMANCE-BASED COMPENSATION COMPRISING BOTH CASH AND SAS TO EXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND CERTAIN SENIOR EXECUTIVES. FOR EXECUTIVE OFFICERS, THEIR AWARDS ARE BASED ON AN AGGREGATE INCENTIVE POOL EQUAL TO A PERCENTAGE OF

CONSOLIDATED OPERATING INCOME. FOR FISCAL YEARS 2013, 2012, AND 2011, THE POOL WAS 0.35%, 0.3%, AND 0.25% OF OPERATING INCOME, RESPECTIVELY. THE SAS VEST RATABLY IN AUGUST OF EACH OF THE FOUR YEARS FOLLOWING THE GRANT DATE. THE FINAL CASH AWARDS

WILL BE DETERMINED AFTER EACH PERFORMANCE PERIOD BASED ON INDIVIDUAL AND BUSINESS PERFORMANCE.

NOTE 21  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

IN ITS OPERATION OF THE BUSINESS, MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER, THE COMPANYS CHIEF EXECUTIVE

OFFICER, REVIEWS CERTAIN FINANCIAL INFORMATION, INCLUDING SEGMENTED INTERNAL PROFIT AND LOSS STATEMENTS PREPARED ON A BASIS NOT CONSISTENT WITH U.S. GAAP. THE SEGMENT INFORMATION WITHIN THIS NOTE IS REPORTED ON THAT BASIS. DURING THE PERIODS

PRESENTED, OUR FIVE SEGMENTS WERE WINDOWS DIVISION, SERVER AND TOOLS, ONLINE SERVICES DIVISION, MICROSOFT BUSINESS DIVISION, AND ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION. DURING THE THREE MONTHS ENDED DECEMBER 31, 2012, WE CHANGED THE NAME OF OUR

WINDOWS & WINDOWS LIVE DIVISION TO WINDOWS DIVISION.

DUE TO THE INTEGRATED STRUCTURE OF OUR BUSINESS, CERTAIN REVENUE EARNED

AND COSTS INCURRED BY ONE SEGMENT MAY BENEFIT OTHER SEGMENTS. REVENUE ON CERTAIN CONTRACTS MAY BE ALLOCATED AMONG THE SEGMENTS BASED ON THE RELATIVE VALUE OF THE UNDERLYING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. COSTS THAT ARE IDENTIFIABLE ARE ALLOCATED TO THE

SEGMENTS THAT BENEFIT TO INCENT CROSS-COLLABORATION AMONG OUR SEGMENTS SO THAT ONE SEGMENT IS NOT SOLELY BURDENED BY THE COST OF A MUTUALLY BENEFICIAL ACTIVITY. ALLOCATED COSTS MAY INCLUDE THOSE RELATING TO DEVELOPMENT AND MARKETING OF PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES FROM WHICH MULTIPLE SEGMENTS BENEFIT, OR THOSE COSTS RELATING TO SERVICES PERFORMED BY ONE SEGMENT ON BEHALF OF OTHER SEGMENTS. EACH ALLOCATION IS MEASURED DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES OF THE COSTS BEING

ALLOCATED.

IN ADDITION, CERTAIN COSTS INCURRED AT A CORPORATE LEVEL THAT ARE IDENTIFIABLE AND THAT BENEFIT

OUR SEGMENTS ARE ALLOCATED TO THEM. THESE ALLOCATED COSTS INCLUDE COSTS OF: FIELD SELLING; EMPLOYEE BENEFITS; SHARED FACILITIES SERVICES; AND CUSTOMER SERVICE AND SUPPORT. EACH ALLOCATION IS MEASURED DIFFERENTLY BASED ON THE SPECIFIC FACTS AND

WE HAVE RECAST CERTAIN PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS WITHIN THIS NOTE TO CONFORM TO THE WAY WE INTERNALLY MANAGED AND MONITORED SEGMENT PERFORMANCE DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR, REFLECTING IMMATERIAL MOVEMENTS OF BUSINESS

ACTIVITIES BETWEEN SEGMENTS AND CHANGES IN COST ALLOCATIONS. IN JULY 2013, WE ANNOUNCED A CHANGE IN ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AS PART OF OUR TRANSFORMATION TO A DEVICES AND SERVICES COMPANY. AS WE EVOLVE HOW WE ALLOCATE RESOURCES AND ANALYZE

REDMOND, WASHINGTON

WE HAVE AUDITED THE ACCOMPANYING CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEETS OF MICROSOFT

CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF JUNE 30, 2013 AND 2012, AND THE RELATED CONSOLIDATED STATEMENTS OF INCOME, COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, CASH FLOWS, AND STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD

ENDED JUNE 30, 2013. THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE THE RESPONSIBILITY OF THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THESE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS BASED ON OUR AUDITS.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDITS IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ARE FREE OF MATERIAL MISSTATEMENT. AN AUDIT INCLUDES EXAMINING, ON A TEST BASIS, EVIDENCE SUPPORTING THE AMOUNTS AND DISCLOSURES IN

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. AN AUDIT ALSO INCLUDES ASSESSING THE ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES USED AND SIGNIFICANT ESTIMATES MADE BY MANAGEMENT, AS WELL AS EVALUATING THE OVERALL FINANCIAL STATEMENT PRESENTATION. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDITS PROVIDE A

REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

IN OUR OPINION, SUCH CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS PRESENT FAIRLY, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, THE

FINANCIAL POSITION OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES AS OF JUNE 30, 2013 AND 2012, AND THE RESULTS OF THEIR OPERATIONS AND THEIR CASH FLOWS FOR EACH OF THE THREE YEARS IN THE PERIOD ENDED JUNE 30, 2013, IN CONFORMITY WITH

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

ITEM 9A. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND

WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE HAVE EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS REQUIRED BY EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(B) AS OF THE END OF

THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT. BASED ON THAT EVALUATION, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THESE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE EFFECTIVE.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR THE COMPANY. INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES MAINTAINING RECORDS THAT IN REASONABLE DETAIL ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT OUR TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY FOR PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF COMPANY ASSETS ARE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZATION; AND PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF COMPANY ASSETS

THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT A

MISSTATEMENT OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED.

MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (1992)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT

CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF JUNE 30, 2013. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2013 THAT HAVE

MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP HAS AUDITED OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2013; THEIR REPORT IS

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION

REDMOND, WASHINGTON

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF MICROSOFT

CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (1992)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS

REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED

NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF

DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING

PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND

DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS

AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR

DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT

LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO,

PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE

WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (1992)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2013, OF THE COMPANY AND OUR REPORT DATED JULY 30, 2013, EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
