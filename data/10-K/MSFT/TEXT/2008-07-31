PART I

ITEM 1.    BUSINESS

GENERAL

OUR MISSION IS TO ENABLE PEOPLE AND BUSINESSES THROUGHOUT THE WORLD TO REALIZE THEIR FULL POTENTIAL. SINCE THE COMPANY WAS FOUNDED IN 1975, WE HAVE WORKED TO ACHIEVE THIS MISSION BY CREATING TECHNOLOGY

THAT TRANSFORMS THE WAY PEOPLE WORK, PLAY, AND COMMUNICATE. WE DEVELOP AND MARKET SOFTWARE, SERVICES, HARDWARE, AND SOLUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE DELIVER NEW OPPORTUNITIES, GREATER CONVENIENCE, AND ENHANCED VALUE TO PEOPLES LIVES. WE DO BUSINESS

THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND HAVE OFFICES IN MORE THAN 100 COUNTRIES.

WE GENERATE

REVENUE BY DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING, LICENSING, AND SUPPORTING A WIDE RANGE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMPUTING DEVICES. OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE OPERATING SYSTEMS FOR SERVERS, PERSONAL

COMPUTERS, AND INTELLIGENT DEVICES; SERVER APPLICATIONS FOR DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING ENVIRONMENTS; INFORMATION WORKER PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS; BUSINESS SOLUTIONS APPLICATIONS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING APPLICATIONS; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS; AND

VIDEO GAMES. WE PROVIDE CONSULTING AND PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES, AND WE TRAIN AND CERTIFY COMPUTER SYSTEM INTEGRATORS AND DEVELOPERS. WE ALSO DESIGN AND SELL HARDWARE INCLUDING THE XBOX 360 VIDEO GAME CONSOLE, THE ZUNE DIGITAL MUSIC AND

ENTERTAINMENT DEVICE, AND PERIPHERALS. ONLINE OFFERINGS AND INFORMATION ARE DELIVERED THROUGH LIVE SEARCH, WINDOWS LIVE, OFFICE LIVE, OUR MSN PORTALS AND CHANNELS, AND THE MICROSOFT ONLINE SERVICES PLATFORM WHICH INCLUDES OFFERINGS FOR BUSINESSES

SUCH AS MICROSOFT DYNAMICS CRM ONLINE, EXCHANGE HOSTED SERVICES, EXCHANGE ONLINE, AND SHAREPOINT ONLINE. WE ENABLE THE DELIVERY OF ONLINE ADVERTISING ACROSS OUR BROAD RANGE OF DIGITAL MEDIA PROPERTIES AND ON LIVE SEARCH THROUGH OUR PROPRIETARY

ADCENTER® PLATFORM.

WE ALSO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES FOR FUTURE SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE BELIEVE THAT

DELIVERING BREAKTHROUGH INNOVATION AND HIGH-VALUE SOLUTIONS THROUGH OUR INTEGRATED SOFTWARE PLATFORM IS THE KEY TO MEETING OUR CUSTOMERS NEEDS AND TO OUR FUTURE GROWTH. WE BELIEVE THAT WE WILL CONTINUE TO LAY THE FOUNDATION FOR LONG-TERM

GROWTH BY DELIVERING NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, CREATING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERS, IMPROVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION, AND IMPROVING OUR INTERNAL PROCESSES. OUR FOCUS IS TO BUILD ON THIS FOUNDATION THROUGH ONGOING INNOVATION IN OUR INTEGRATED

SOFTWARE PLATFORMS; BY DELIVERING COMPELLING VALUE PROPOSITIONS TO CUSTOMERS; BY RESPONDING EFFECTIVELY TO CUSTOMER AND PARTNER NEEDS; AND BY CONTINUING TO EMPHASIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PRODUCT EXCELLENCE, BUSINESS EFFICACY, AND ACCOUNTABILITY.

OPERATING SEGMENTS

WE HAVE FIVE OPERATING

SEGMENTS: CLIENT, SERVER AND TOOLS, ONLINE SERVICES BUSINESS, MICROSOFT BUSINESS DIVISION, AND ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION. OUR SEGMENTS PROVIDE MANAGEMENT WITH A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL VIEW OF OUR KEY BUSINESSES. THE SEGMENTS ENABLE THE

ALIGNMENT OF STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES ACROSS THE DEVELOPMENT, SALES, MARKETING, AND SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS, AND THEY PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR TIMELY AND RATIONAL ALLOCATION OF DEVELOPMENT, SALES, MARKETING, AND SERVICES RESOURCES WITHIN BUSINESSES.

THE SEGMENTS ALSO HELP FOCUS STRATEGIC PLANNING EFFORTS ON KEY OBJECTIVES AND INITIATIVES ACROSS OUR BUSINESSES.

DUE TO OUR INTEGRATED BUSINESS

STRUCTURE, OPERATING COSTS INCLUDED IN ONE SEGMENT MAY BENEFIT OTHER SEGMENTS. THEREFORE, THESE SEGMENTS ARE NOT DESIGNED TO MEASURE OPERATING INCOME OR LOSS THAT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDED IN EACH SEGMENT.

INTER-SEGMENT COST COMMISSIONS ARE ESTIMATED BY MANAGEMENT AND USED TO COMPENSATE OR CHARGE EACH SEGMENT FOR SUCH SHARED COSTS AND TO MOTIVATE SHARED EFFORT. SEGMENTS SHOULD NOT BE VIEWED AS DISCRETE OR EASILY SEPARABLE BUSINESSES.

CLIENT

CLIENT HAS OVERALL

RESPONSIBILITY FOR TECHNICAL ARCHITECTURE, ENGINEERING, AND PRODUCT DELIVERY OF OUR WINDOWS PRODUCT FAMILY AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR RELATIONSHIPS WITH PERSONAL COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS, INCLUDING MULTINATIONAL AND REGIONAL ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT

MANUFACTURERS (OEMS). THE SEGMENT INCLUDES SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES FOR THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS FOR THE WINDOWS PLATFORM. CLIENT REVENUE GROWTH IS CORRELATED WITH THE GROWTH OF PURCHASES OF

PERSONAL COMPUTERS FROM OEMS THAT PRE-INSTALL VERSIONS OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS AS THE OEM CHANNEL ACCOUNTS FOR OVER 80% OF TOTAL CLIENT REVENUE.

WE RELEASED WINDOWS VISTA, THE MOST RECENT VERSION OF THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM, IN FISCAL YEAR 2007. THIS RELEASE CONCLUDED A MAJOR DEVELOPMENT PHASE THAT WE BELIEVE RESULTED IN A SIGNIFICANTLY MORE MANAGEABLE AND POWERFUL

PC OPERATING SYSTEM COMPARED WITH PRIOR RELEASES. WINDOWS VISTA INCLUDES ADVANCES IN SECURITY, DIGITAL MEDIA, USER INTERFACES, AND OTHER AREAS THAT ENHANCE THE USER AND DEVELOPER EXPERIENCE.

CLIENT OFFERINGS CONSIST OF PREMIUM AND STANDARD EDITION WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS. PREMIUM EDITIONS ARE THOSE THAT INCLUDE ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY

AND ARE SOLD AT A PRICE ABOVE OUR STANDARD EDITIONS.

PRODUCTS.

WINDOWS VISTA, INCLUDING HOME, HOME

PREMIUM, ULTIMATE, BUSINESS, ENTERPRISE AND STARTER EDITION; WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL AND HOME; MEDIA CENTER EDITION; TABLET PC EDITION; AND OTHER STANDARD WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS.

COMPETITION

CLIENT FACES STRONG COMPETITION FROM WELL-ESTABLISHED COMPANIES WITH DIFFERING

APPROACHES TO THE PC MARKET. COMPETING COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING VARIANTS OF UNIX, ARE SUPPLIED BY COMPETITORS SUCH AS APPLE, HEWLETT-PACKARD, IBM, AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS. THE LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM, WHICH IS ALSO DERIVED FROM UNIX AND

IS AVAILABLE WITHOUT PAYMENT UNDER A GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE, HAS GAINED SOME ACCEPTANCE AS COMPETITIVE PRESSURES LEAD PC OEMS TO REDUCE COSTS AND NEW, LOWER PRICE PC FORM FACTORS GAIN ADOPTION. APPLE TAKES AN INTEGRATED APPROACH TO THE PC EXPERIENCE

AND HAS MADE INROADS IN SHARE, PARTICULARLY IN THE U.S. AND IN THE CONSUMER SEGMENT.

THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM ALSO FACES

COMPETITION FROM ALTERNATIVE PLATFORMS AND NEW DEVICES THAT MAY REDUCE CONSUMER DEMAND FOR TRADITIONAL PERSONAL COMPUTERS. COMPETITORS SUCH AS MOZILLA OFFER SOFTWARE THAT COMPETES WITH THE INTERNET EXPLORER WEB BROWSING CAPABILITIES OF WINDOWS

PRODUCTS. USER AND USAGE VOLUMES ON MOBILE DEVICES ARE INCREASING AROUND THE WORLD RELATIVE TO THE PC.

OUR OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCTS

COMPETE EFFECTIVELY BY DELIVERING INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE, GIVING CUSTOMERS CHOICE AND FLEXIBILITY, A FAMILIAR, EASY-TO-USE INTERFACE, COMPATIBILITY WITH A BROAD RANGE OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, AND THE LARGEST SUPPORT NETWORK FOR ANY

OPERATING SYSTEM.

SERVER AND TOOLS

SERVER AND TOOLS DEVELOPS AND MARKETS SOFTWARE SERVER PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND SOLUTIONS. WINDOWS SERVER-BASED PRODUCTS ARE INTEGRATED SERVER INFRASTRUCTURE AND MIDDLEWARE SOFTWARE DESIGNED TO SUPPORT SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND

TOOLS BUILT ON THE WINDOWS SERVER OPERATING SYSTEM. WINDOWS SERVER-BASED PRODUCTS INCLUDE THE SERVER PLATFORM INCLUDING TARGETED SEGMENT SOLUTIONS, DATABASE, STORAGE, MANAGEMENT AND OPERATIONS, SERVICE-ORIENTED ARCHITECTURE PLATFORM, AND SECURITY

AND IDENTITY SOFTWARE. THE SEGMENT ALSO BUILDS STANDALONE AND SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT LIFECYCLE TOOLS FOR SOFTWARE ARCHITECTS, DEVELOPERS, TESTERS, AND PROJECT MANAGERS. SERVER PRODUCTS CAN BE RUN ON-SITE, IN A HOSTING ENVIRONMENT, OR IN A WEB-BASED

ENVIRONMENT.

WE OFFER A BROAD RANGE OF CONSULTING SERVICES AND PROVIDE PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES AND INDUSTRY SOLUTIONS. WE ALSO

PROVIDE TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION TO DEVELOPERS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY PROFESSIONALS ABOUT OUR SERVER AND TOOLS AND CLIENT PLATFORM PRODUCTS.

ITEM 1

APPROXIMATELY 45% OF SERVER AND TOOLS

REVENUE COMES FROM MULTI-YEAR LICENSING AGREEMENTS, APPROXIMATELY 25% IS PURCHASED THROUGH FULLY PACKAGED PRODUCT AND TRANSACTIONAL VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS, AND APPROXIMATELY 10% COMES FROM LICENSES SOLD TO OEMS. THE REMAINDER OF SERVER AND TOOLS

REVENUE COMES FROM CONSULTING AND PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES.

MAJOR RELEASES FROM SERVER AND TOOLS IN FISCAL YEAR 2008 INCLUDED WINDOWS

SERVER 2008 AND VISUAL STUDIO 2008. WINDOWS SERVER 2008 PROVIDES VIRTUALIZATION TECHNOLOGIES, SECURITY ENHANCEMENTS, NEW INTERNET TOOLS AND INFRASTRUCTURE, AND MANAGEMENT UTILITIES WHILE VISUAL STUDIO 2008 PROVIDES RAPID APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT,

TEAM COLLABORATION TOOLS, AND ADVANCES IN BUILDING CONNECTED APPLICATIONS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2009, WE PLAN TO RELEASE MICROSOFT SQL SERVER 2008 WHICH WILL DELIVER ADVANCES IN DATABASE SCALABILITY, PERFORMANCE, SECURITY, AND POLICY-BASED MANAGEMENT.

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

WINDOWS SERVER OPERATING SYSTEM; MICROSOFT SQL SERVER; MICROSOFT ENTERPRISE

SERVICES; PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES; VISUAL STUDIO; SYSTEM CENTER PRODUCTS; FOREFRONT SECURITY PRODUCTS; BIZ TALK SERVER; MSDN; AND OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

COMPETITION

OUR SERVER OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCTS FACE INTENSE COMPETITION FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF SERVER OPERATING

SYSTEMS AND SERVER APPLICATIONS, OFFERED BY COMPANIES WITH A VARIETY OF MARKET APPROACHES. VERTICALLY INTEGRATED COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS SUCH AS HEWLETT-PACKARD, IBM, AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS OFFER THEIR OWN VERSIONS OF THE UNIX OPERATING SYSTEM

PREINSTALLED ON SERVER HARDWARE. NEARLY ALL COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS OFFER SERVER HARDWARE FOR THE LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM AND MANY CONTRIBUTE TO LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM DEVELOPMENT. THE COMPETITIVE POSITION OF LINUX HAS ALSO BENEFITED FROM THE LARGE

NUMBER OF COMPATIBLE APPLICATIONS NOW PRODUCED BY MANY LEADING COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS AND NON-COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS. A NUMBER OF COMPANIES SUPPLY VERSIONS OF LINUX, INCLUDING NOVELL AND RED HAT. SERVER VIRTUALIZATION PLATFORM

PROVIDERS, SUCH AS VMWARE, ARE ANOTHER FORM OF COMPETITION FOR THE WINDOWS SERVER OPERATING SYSTEM.

WE HAVE ENTERED INTO BUSINESS AND

TECHNICAL COLLABORATION AGREEMENTS WITH NOVELL AND OTHER LINUX PROVIDERS TO BUILD, MARKET, AND SUPPORT A SERIES OF SOLUTIONS TO ENHANCE THE INTEROPERABILITY OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH THEIR VIRTUALIZATION, MANAGEMENT, AND NETWORK SECURITY SOLUTIONS, AND

TO PROVIDE EACH OTHERS CUSTOMERS WITH PATENT COVERAGE FOR THEIR RESPECTIVE PRODUCTS.

WE COMPETE TO PROVIDE ENTERPRISE-WIDE

COMPUTING SOLUTIONS WITH SEVERAL COMPANIES THAT OFFER SOLUTIONS AND MIDDLEWARE TECHNOLOGY PLATFORMS. IBM AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS LEAD A GROUP OF COMPANIES FOCUSED ON THE JAVA 2 PLATFORM ENTERPRISE EDITION (J2EE). COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS THAT

PROVIDE COMPETING SERVER APPLICATIONS FOR PC-BASED DISTRIBUTED CLIENT/SERVER ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDE CA, INC., IBM, AND ORACLE. OUR WEB APPLICATION PLATFORM SOFTWARE COMPETES WITH OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SUCH AS LINUX, APACHE, MYSQL, AND PHP, AND WE

COMPETE AGAINST JAVA MIDDLEWARE SUCH AS JBOSS, GERONIMO, AND SPRING FRAMEWORK.

NUMEROUS COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE VENDORS OFFER COMPETING

COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS FOR CONNECTIVITY (BOTH INTERNET AND INTRANET), SECURITY, HOSTING, AND E-BUSINESS SERVERS. SYSTEM CENTER COMPETES WITH HEWLETT-PACKARD, BMC, CA, INC., AND IBM IN THE MANAGEMENT OF INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

INFRASTRUCTURES, WHILE OUR FOREFRONT LINE OF BUSINESS SECURITY PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH MCAFEE, SYMANTEC, AND TREND MICRO IN PROTECTING BOTH CLIENT AND SERVER APPLICATIONS. OUR PRODUCTS FOR SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS COMPETE AGAINST OFFERINGS FROM ADOBE, BEA

SYSTEMS, BORLAND, IBM, ORACLE, SUN MICROSYSTEMS, AND OTHER COMPANIES. THESE OFFERINGS INCLUDE OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS LIKE ECLIPSE (SPONSORED BY IBM AND ORACLE). WE BELIEVE THAT OUR SERVER PRODUCTS PROVIDE CUSTOMERS WITH ADVANTAGES IN INNOVATION,

PERFORMANCE, TOTAL COSTS OF OWNERSHIP, AND PRODUCTIVITY BY DELIVERING SUPERIOR APPLICATIONS, DEVELOPMENT TOOLS, AND COMPATIBILITY WITH A BROAD BASE OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, SECURITY, AND MANAGEABILITY.

ONLINE SERVICES BUSINESS

THE ONLINE

SERVICES BUSINESS (OSB) CONSISTS OF AN ON-LINE ADVERTISING PLATFORM WITH OFFERINGS FOR BOTH PUBLISHERS AND ADVERTISERS, PERSONAL COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES SUCH AS EMAIL AND INSTANT MESSAGING, ONLINE INFORMATION OFFERINGS SUCH AS LIVE

SEARCH, AND THE MSN PORTALS AND CHANNELS AROUND THE WORLD. WE EARN REVENUE PRIMARILY FROM ONLINE ADVERTISING, INCLUDING SEARCH, DISPLAY, AND EMAIL AND MESSAGING SERVICES. REVENUE IS ALSO GENERATED THROUGH SUBSCRIPTIONS AND TRANSACTIONS GENERATED

FROM ONLINE PAID SERVICES, FROM ADVERTISER AND PUBLISHER TOOLS, DIGITAL MARKETING AND ADVERTISING AGENCY SERVICES, AND FROM MSN NARROWBAND INTERNET ACCESS SUBSCRIBERS. WE CONTINUE TO LAUNCH NEW ONLINE OFFERINGS AND EXPECT TO DO SO IN THE FUTURE.

DURING FISCAL YEAR 2008, WE LAUNCHED NEW RELEASES OF

WINDOWS LIVE SEARCH, THE WINDOWS LIVE SUITE OF APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES, AND UPDATED OUR MSN VIDEO SERVICE. IN ADDITION, WE LAUNCHED A NEW RELEASE OF ADCENTER, OUR

PROPRIETARY ADVERTISING PLATFORM, AND ALSO EXPANDED OUR ADVERTISING PLATFORM PORTFOLIO THROUGH ACQUISITIONS.

WE ACQUIRED A NUMBER OF

COMPANIES DURING THE FISCAL YEAR, THE MOST SIGNIFICANT OF WHICH WAS AQUANTIVE, INC., A DIGITAL MARKETING BUSINESS THAT WE EXPECT WILL PLAY A KEY ROLE IN THE FUTURE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR ONLINE SERVICES BUSINESS. WE BELIEVE THE ACQUISITION WILL HELP US

BUILD AND SUPPORT NEXT-GENERATION ADVERTISER AND PUBLISHER SOLUTIONS FOR CROSS MEDIA PLANNING, VIDEO-ON-DEMAND, AND INTERNET PROTOCOL TELEVISION.

PRODUCTS.

LIVE SEARCH; MSN; MAPPOINT; MSN INTERNET ACCESS; MSN PREMIUM WEB SERVICES (CONSISTING OF MSN INTERNET SOFTWARE SUBSCRIPTION, MSN HOTMAIL PLUS, AND MSN SOFTWARE SERVICES); WINDOWS LIVE;

MSN MOBILE SERVICES; AVENUEA RAZORFISH MEDIA AGENCY SERVICES; ATLAS ONLINE TOOLS FOR ADVERTISERS; AND THE DRIVE PM AD NETWORK FOR PUBLISHERS.

COMPETITION

OSB COMPETES WITH AOL, GOOGLE, YAHOO!, AND A WIDE ARRAY OF WEB SITES AND PORTALS THAT PROVIDE CONTENT AND ONLINE

OFFERINGS OF ALL TYPES TO END USERS. WE COMPETE WITH THESE ORGANIZATIONS TO PROVIDE ADVERTISING OPPORTUNITIES FOR MERCHANTS. OSB ALSO COMPETES FOR NARROWBAND INTERNET ACCESS USERS WITH AOL, EARTHLINK, AND OTHER ISPS FOR DIAL-UP INTERNET ACCESS IN

THE UNITED STATES. THE INTERNET ADVERTISING INDUSTRY HAS GROWN SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST SEVERAL YEARS, AND WE ANTICIPATE THAT THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE. COMPETITORS ARE AGGRESSIVELY DEVELOPING INTERNET OFFERINGS THAT SEEK TO PROVIDE MORE EFFECTIVE

WAYS OF CONNECTING ADVERTISERS WITH AUDIENCES THROUGH ENHANCED FUNCTIONALITY IN COMMUNICATION SERVICES, IMPROVEMENTS IN INFORMATION SERVICES SUCH AS INTERNET SEARCH, AND IMPROVED ADVERTISING INFRASTRUCTURE AND SUPPORT SERVICES. WE HAVE DEVELOPED OUR

OWN ALGORITHMIC SEARCH ENGINE TO PROVIDE END USERS WITH MORE RELEVANT SEARCH RESULTS, EXPANDED SEARCH SERVICES, AND A BROADER SELECTION OF CONTENT. TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF OUR ADVERTISING BUSINESS, WE ALSO ARE INVESTING IN OUR COMMUNICATION

SERVICES, TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONS, AND SALES EFFORTS. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING WINDOWS LIVE SERVICES THAT ARE AIMED AT ATTRACTING ADDITIONAL USERS THROUGH IMPROVEMENTS IN THE USER ONLINE EXPERIENCE. AS

CONSUMERS MIGRATE FROM NARROWBAND TO BROADBAND INTERNET ACCESS, WE EXPECT OUR NARROWBAND INTERNET ACCESS SUBSCRIBER BASE TO CONTINUE TO DECLINE AND THIS PORTION OF OUR BUSINESS TO DECREASE IN IMPORTANCE. WE BELIEVE THAT WE CAN COMPETE EFFECTIVELY

ACROSS THE BREADTH OF OUR INTERNET SERVICES BY PROVIDING USERS WITH SOFTWARE INNOVATION IN THE FORM OF INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION SERVICES THAT HELP THEM FIND AND USE THE INFORMATION AND EXPERIENCES THEY WANT ONLINE AND BY PROVIDING MERCHANTS

WITH EFFECTIVE ADVERTISING RESULTS THROUGH IMPROVED SYSTEMS AND SALES SUPPORT.

MICROSOFT BUSINESS DIVISION

MICROSOFT BUSINESS DIVISION (MBD) OFFERINGS CONSIST OF THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND MICROSOFT DYNAMICS BUSINESS SOLUTIONS. MICROSOFT OFFICE

SYSTEM PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE PERSONAL, TEAM, AND ORGANIZATION PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH A RANGE OF PROGRAMS, SERVICES, AND SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS. GROWTH OF REVENUE FROM THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM OFFERINGS, WHICH GENERATE OVER 90% OF MBD

REVENUE, DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ADD VALUE TO THE CORE OFFICE PRODUCT SET AND TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN OTHER INFORMATION WORKER AREAS SUCH AS CONTENT MANAGEMENT, ENTERPRISE SEARCH, COLLABORATION, UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS AND

BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE. MICROSOFT DYNAMICS PRODUCTS PROVIDE BUSINESS SOLUTIONS FOR FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT, CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT, SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT, AND ANALYTICS APPLICATIONS FOR SMALL AND MID-SIZE BUSINESSES, LARGE ORGANIZATIONS, AND

DIVISIONS OF GLOBAL ENTERPRISES.

WE EVALUATE MBD RESULTS BASED UPON THE NATURE OF THE END USER IN TWO PRIMARY PARTSBUSINESS

REVENUE WHICH INCLUDES MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM REVENUE GENERATED THROUGH VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS AND MICROSOFT DYNAMICS REVENUE, AND CONSUMER REVENUE WHICH INCLUDES REVENUE FROM RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCT SALES AND OEM REVENUE. APPROXIMATELY

80% OF MBD REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM SALES TO BUSINESSES. REVENUE FROM THIS CATEGORY GENERALLY DEPENDS UPON THE NUMBER OF INFORMATION WORKERS IN A LICENSED ENTERPRISE AND IS THEREFORE RELATIVELY INDEPENDENT OF THE NUMBER OF PCS SOLD IN A GIVEN

YEAR. APPROXIMATELY 20% OF MBD REVENUE IS DERIVED FROM SALES TO CONSUMERS. MOST OF THIS REVENUE IS GENERATED FROM NEW LICENSES ACQUIRED THROUGH FULLY PACKAGED PRODUCTS AND LICENSES SOLD THROUGH OEMS FOR NEW PCS AND IS GENERALLY AFFECTED BY

THE LEVEL OF PC SHIPMENTS AND PRODUCT LAUNCHES.

COMPETITION

COMPETITORS TO THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM INCLUDE MANY SOFTWARE APPLICATION VENDORS SUCH AS APPLE, COREL, GOOGLE, IBM, NOVELL, ORACLE, RED HAT, SUN

MICROSYSTEMS, AND LOCAL APPLICATION DEVELOPERS IN EUROPE AND ASIA. IBM (SMARTSUITE) AND COREL (WORDPERFECT SUITE) HAVE MEASURABLE INSTALLED BASES WITH THEIR OFFICE PRODUCTIVITY PRODUCTS. APPLE MAY DISTRIBUTE CERTAIN OF ITS APPLICATION SOFTWARE

PRODUCTS WITH VARIOUS MODELS OF ITS PCS. THE OPENOFFICE.ORG PROJECT PROVIDES A FREELY DOWNLOADABLE CROSS-PLATFORM APPLICATION THAT ALSO HAS BEEN ADAPTED BY VARIOUS COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE VENDORS TO SELL UNDER THEIR BRANDS, INCLUDING IBM, NOVELL, RED

HAT, AND SUN. CORELS SUITE AND MANY LOCAL SOFTWARE SUITES AROUND THE WORLD ARE AGGRESSIVELY PRICED FOR OEMS TO PREINSTALL ON LOW-PRICED PCS. GOOGLE HAS LAUNCHED GOOGLE APPS, A HOSTED MESSAGING AND PRODUCTIVITY SUITE, AND ALSO PROVIDES AN

ENTERPRISE SEARCH OFFERING THAT COMPETES WITH MICROSOFT OFFICE SHAREPOINT SERVER FOR SEARCH, OUR NEW ENTERPRISE SEARCH PRODUCT. WEB-BASED OFFERINGS SUCH AS AJAXWRITE, GOFFICE, INETOFFICE, SIMDESK, THINKFREE, WIKICALC, OR OTHER SMALL PROJECTS

COMPETING WITH INDIVIDUAL APPLICATIONS, CAN ALSO PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM PRODUCTS. IBM HAS MANY DIFFERENT POINTS OF COMPETITION WITH OFFICE SYSTEM PRODUCTS WITH ITS NOTES AND WORKPLACE OFFERINGS.

AS WE CONTINUE TO RESPOND TO MARKET DEMAND FOR ADDITIONAL FUNCTIONALITY AND PRODUCTS, WE WILL COMPETE WITH ADDITIONAL VENDORS, MOST NOTABLY IN

ENTERPRISE CONTENT MANAGEMENT AND SEARCH, COLLABORATION TOOLS, UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS, AND BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE. THESE COMPETITORS INCLUDE AUTONOMY, CISCO, ENDECA, GOOGLE, IBM, ORACLE, AND SAP.

OUR MICROSOFT DYNAMICS PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH WELL-KNOWN VENDORS SUCH AS INTUIT AND SAGE IN THE MARKET FOCUSED ON PROVIDING SOLUTIONS FOR SMALL AND

MID-SIZED BUSINESSES. THE MARKET FOR LARGE ORGANIZATIONS AND DIVISIONS OF GLOBAL ENTERPRISES IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE WITH A SMALL NUMBER OF PRIMARY VENDORS INCLUDING ORACLE AND SAP. THESE VENDORS ARE POSITIONING MANY OF THEIR BUSINESS

APPLICATIONS TO FOCUS MORE INTENSELY ON SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES. ADDITIONALLY SALESFORCE.COMS ON-DEMAND CUSTOMER RELATIONSHIP MANAGEMENT OFFERINGS COMPETE DIRECTLY WITH MICROSOFT DYNAMICS CRM ONLINE AND MICROSOFT DYNAMIC CRMS

ON-PREMISE OFFERINGS. WE BELIEVE OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE EFFECTIVELY WITH THESE VENDORS BASED ON OUR STRATEGY OF PROVIDING INTEROPERABLE, ADAPTABLE SOLUTIONS THAT WORK WELL WITH TECHNOLOGIES OUR CUSTOMERS ALREADY HAVE.

ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION

THE

ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION (EDD) IS RESPONSIBLE FOR DEVELOPING, PRODUCING, AND MARKETING THE XBOX VIDEO GAME SYSTEM, INCLUDING CONSOLES AND ACCESSORIES, THIRD-PARTY GAMES, GAMES PUBLISHED UNDER THE MICROSOFT BRAND, AND XBOX LIVE

OPERATIONS, AS WELL AS RESEARCH, SALES, AND SUPPORT OF THOSE PRODUCTS. IN ADDITION TO XBOX, WE OFFER THE ZUNE DIGITAL MUSIC AND ENTERTAINMENT DEVICE; PC SOFTWARE GAMES; ONLINE GAMES; MEDIAROOM, OUR INTERNET PROTOCOL TELEVISION SOFTWARE; MOBILE AND

EMBEDDED DEVICE PLATFORMS, SURFACE COMPUTING PLATFORM; AND OTHER DEVICES. EDD ALSO LEADS THE DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS OF OUR LINE OF CONSUMER SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS INCLUDING APPLICATION SOFTWARE FOR MACINTOSH COMPUTERS AND MICROSOFT PC HARDWARE

PRODUCTS, AND IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ALL RETAIL SALES AND MARKETING FOR MICROSOFT OFFICE AND THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS.

PRODUCTS.

XBOX 360 CONSOLE AND GAMES; XBOX LIVE; ZUNE; MEDIAROOM; NUMEROUS CONSUMER SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS (SUCH AS MICE AND KEYBOARDS); WINDOWS MOBILE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES PLATFORM; WINDOWS EMBEDDED

DEVICE OPERATING SYSTEM; WINDOWS AUTOMOTIVE; AND SURFACE COMPUTING PLATFORM.

COMPETITION

ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES BUSINESSES ARE HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, FREQUENT INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND TITLES, AND THE

DEVELOPMENT OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. THE MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS ARE CHARACTERIZED BY SIGNIFICANT PRICE COMPETITION. WE ANTICIPATE CONTINUED PRICING PRESSURE FROM OUR COMPETITORS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE HAVE RESPONDED TO THIS PRESSURE BY REDUCING PRICES

ON CERTAIN PRODUCTS. OUR COMPETITORS VARY IN SIZE FROM VERY SMALL COMPANIES WITH LIMITED RESOURCES TO VERY LARGE, DIVERSIFIED CORPORATIONS WITH SUBSTANTIAL FINANCIAL AND MARKETING RESOURCES. WE COMPETE PRIMARILY ON THE BASIS OF PRODUCT INNOVATION,

QUALITY AND VARIETY, TIMING OF PRODUCT RELEASES, AND EFFECTIVENESS OF DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1

OUR XBOX HARDWARE BUSINESS COMPETES

WITH CONSOLE PLATFORMS FROM NINTENDO AND SONY, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE A LARGE, ESTABLISHED BASE OF CUSTOMERS. THE LIFECYCLE FOR VIDEO GAME CONSOLES AVERAGES FIVE TO SEVEN YEARS. WE RELEASED XBOX 360, OUR SECOND GENERATION CONSOLE, IN NOVEMBER 2005.

NINTENDO AND SONY RELEASED NEW VERSIONS OF THEIR GAME CONSOLES IN LATE 2006. WE BELIEVE THE SUCCESS OF VIDEO GAME CONSOLES IS DETERMINED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF GAMES FOR THE CONSOLE, PROVIDING EXCLUSIVE GAME CONTENT THAT GAMERS SEEK, THE

COMPUTATIONAL POWER AND RELIABILITY OF THE CONSOLE, AND THE ABILITY TO CREATE NEW REVENUE SOURCES SUCH AS ADVERTISING AND DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT. WE THINK THE XBOX 360 IS POSITIONED WELL AGAINST COMPETITIVE CONSOLE PRODUCTS BASED ON SIGNIFICANT

INNOVATION IN HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE, NEW DEVELOPER TOOLS, EXPANDED REVENUE SOURCES, AND CONTINUED STRONG EXCLUSIVE CONTENT FROM OUR OWN GAME FRANCHISES SUCH AS HALO.

IN ADDITION TO COMPETING AGAINST SOFTWARE PUBLISHED FOR NON-XBOX PLATFORMS, OUR GAMES BUSINESS ALSO COMPETES WITH NUMEROUS COMPANIES THAT WE HAVE LICENSED TO DEVELOP AND PUBLISH SOFTWARE FOR THE XBOX

CONSOLES. ZUNE COMPETES WITH THE APPLE IPOD AND OTHER DIGITAL MUSIC AND ENTERTAINMENT DEVICES. OUR PC HARDWARE PRODUCTS FACE AGGRESSIVE COMPETITION FROM COMPUTER AND OTHER HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS, MANY OF WHICH ARE ALSO CURRENT OR POTENTIAL PARTNERS.

MEDIAROOM FACES COMPETITION PRIMARILY FROM A VARIETY OF COMPETITORS THAT PROVIDE ELEMENTS OF AN INTERNET PROTOCOL TELEVISION DELIVERY PLATFORM, BUT THAT DO NOT PROVIDE END-TO-END SOLUTIONS FOR THE NETWORK OPERATOR. WINDOWS MOBILE SOFTWARE AND

SERVICES FACES SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM APPLE, NOKIA, OPENWAVE SYSTEMS, PALM, QUALCOMM, RESEARCH IN MOTION, AND SYMBIAN. THE EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEM BUSINESS IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED WITH MANY COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. KEY COMPETITORS INCLUDE IBM,

WIND RIVER, AND VERSIONS OF EMBEDDABLE LINUX FROM COMMERCIAL LINUX VENDORS SUCH AS METROWERKS AND MONTAVISTA SOFTWARE.

OPERATIONS

TO SERVE THE NEEDS OF CUSTOMERS AROUND THE WORLD AND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND USABILITY OF PRODUCTS IN INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, WE LOCALIZE MANY OF

OUR PRODUCTS TO REFLECT LOCAL LANGUAGES AND CONVENTIONS. LOCALIZING A PRODUCT MAY REQUIRE MODIFYING THE USER INTERFACE, ALTERING DIALOG BOXES, AND TRANSLATING TEXT.

OUR OPERATIONAL CENTERS SUPPORT ALL OPERATIONS IN THEIR REGIONS, INCLUDING CUSTOMER CONTRACT AND ORDER PROCESSING, CREDIT AND COLLECTIONS, INFORMATION PROCESSING, AND VENDOR MANAGEMENT AND LOGISTICS. THE

REGIONAL CENTER IN IRELAND SUPPORTS THE EUROPEAN, MIDDLE EASTERN, AND AFRICAN REGION; THE CENTER IN SINGAPORE SUPPORTS THE JAPAN, GREATER CHINA AND ASIA-PACIFIC REGION; AND THE CENTERS IN FARGO, NORTH DAKOTA, PUERTO RICO, REDMOND, WASHINGTON, AND

RENO, NEVADA SUPPORT LATIN AMERICA AND NORTH AMERICA.

WE CONTRACT MOST OF OUR MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES FOR XBOX 360 AND RELATED

GAMES, ZUNE, VARIOUS RETAIL SOFTWARE PACKAGED PRODUCTS, AND MICROSOFT HARDWARE TO THIRD PARTIES. OUR PRODUCTS MAY INCLUDE SOME COMPONENTS THAT ARE AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE OR LIMITED SOURCES. OUR XBOX 360 CONSOLE INCLUDES CERTAIN KEY COMPONENTS THAT

ARE SUPPLIED BY A SINGLE SOURCE. THE CENTRAL PROCESSING UNIT IS PURCHASED FROM IBM AND THE GRAPHICS CHIPS AND EMBEDDED DYNAMIC RANDOM ACCESS MEMORY CHIPS FOR THE GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT ARE PURCHASED FROM TAIWAN SEMICONDUCTOR MANUFACTURING COMPANY

AND NEC CORPORATION, RESPECTIVELY. ALTHOUGH WE HAVE CHOSEN TO INITIALLY SOURCE THESE KEY XBOX 360 COMPONENTS FROM A SINGLE SUPPLIER, WE ARE UNDER NO OBLIGATION TO EXCLUSIVELY SOURCE COMPONENTS FROM THESE VENDORS IN THE FUTURE. BEYOND THE EXCEPTIONS

NOTED, WE GENERALLY HAVE THE ABILITY TO USE OTHER CUSTOM MANUFACTURERS IF THE CURRENT VENDOR BECOMES UNAVAILABLE. WE GENERALLY HAVE MULTIPLE SOURCES FOR RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIES, AND COMPONENTS, AND ARE OFTEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMPONENT PARTS AND

MATERIALS ON A VOLUME DISCOUNT BASIS.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

DURING FISCAL YEARS 2008, 2007, AND 2006, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $8.2 BILLION, $7.1 BILLION, AND $6.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENTED 14%, 14%, AND 15%, RESPECTIVELY, OF REVENUE IN EACH OF THOSE

YEARS. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

WHILE MOST

OF OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY, WE ALSO PURCHASE TECHNOLOGY, LICENSE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND OVERSEE THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND LOCALIZATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE WE ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT UPON LICENSES

AND OTHER AGREEMENTS WITH THIRD PARTIES RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR PRODUCTS. INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS US TO MAINTAIN CLOSER TECHNICAL CONTROL OVER OUR PRODUCTS. IT ALSO GIVES US THE FREEDOM TO DECIDE WHICH MODIFICATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS

ARE MOST IMPORTANT AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. GENERALLY, WE ALSO CREATE PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION INTERNALLY. WE STRIVE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION AS EARLY AS

POSSIBLE ABOUT CHANGING USAGE PATTERNS AND HARDWARE ADVANCES THAT MAY AFFECT SOFTWARE DESIGN. BEFORE RELEASING NEW SOFTWARE PLATFORMS, WE PROVIDE APPLICATION VENDORS

WITH A RANGE OF RESOURCES AND GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, AND TESTING.

INVESTING IN BUSINESS AND PRODUCT

DEVELOPMENT.

INNOVATION IS A KEY FACTOR IN MICROSOFTS GROWTH. OUR MODEL FOR GROWTH IS BASED ON BROAD ADOPTION OF THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE DEVELOP AND MARKET, OUR WILLINGNESS TO ENTER NEW MARKETS, AND OUR ABILITY

TO EMBRACE AND ACT ON DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS. WE CONTINUE OUR LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOP, IN A WIDE SPECTRUM OF TECHNOLOGIES, TOOLS, AND PLATFORMS SPANNING COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION; INFORMATION ACCESS AND ORGANIZATION;

ENTERTAINMENT; BUSINESS AND E-COMMERCE; AND DEVICES. INCREASINGLY, WE ARE TAKING A GLOBAL APPROACH TO INNOVATION. WHILE OUR MAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN REDMOND, WASHINGTON, WE ALSO OPERATE RESEARCH FACILITIES IN OTHER

PARTS OF THE UNITED STATES AND AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING CANADA, CHINA, DENMARK, ENGLAND, INDIA, IRELAND, AND ISRAEL. THIS GLOBAL APPROACH WILL HELP US REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN LOCAL MARKETS AND ENABLES US TO CONTINUE TO ATTRACT TOP TALENT FROM

ACROSS THE GLOBE.

BASED ON OUR BROAD FOCUS ON INNOVATION AND LONG-TERM APPROACH TO NEW MARKETS, WE SEE THE FOLLOWING KEY

OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH.

CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY.

TO BUILD ON OUR STRENGTH IN THE CONSUMER MARKETPLACE

WITH WINDOWS VISTA, THE 2007 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, XBOX 360, MICROSOFT WINDOWS LIVE, WINDOWS MOBILE, AND ZUNE, WE ARE FOCUSED ON DELIVERING PRODUCTS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE COMPELLING AND CUTTING EDGE IN TERMS OF DESIGN, FEATURES, AND FUNCTIONALITY.

TO SUCCEED IN CONSUMER TECHNOLOGIES, WE ALSO ARE WORKING TO DEFINE THE NEXT ERA OF CONSUMER ELECTRONICS. IN THE PAST, CONSUMER ELECTRONICS WAS A HARDWARE-CENTRIC BUSINESS; TODAY, THE INNOVATION IN CONSUMER ELECTRONICS DEVICES LIES IN THE SOFTWARE

THAT POWERS THEM. THIS IS CREATING NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR US TO DELIVER END-TO-END EXPERIENCES THAT CONNECT USERS TO INFORMATION, COMMUNICATIONS, ENTERTAINMENT, AND PEOPLE IN NEW AND COMPELLING WAYS.

SOFTWARE PLUS SERVICES.

UNDERLYING OUR OPPORTUNITIES IN ALL OF OUR BUSINESSES IS A COMPANY-WIDE COMMITMENT TO EMBRACE

SOFTWARE PLUS SERVICES. THE ABILITY TO COMBINE THE POWER OF DESKTOP AND SERVER SOFTWARE WITH THE REACH OF THE INTERNET REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY ACROSS EVERY ONE OF OUR BUSINESSES. AS WE CONTINUE TO BUILD OUT OUR SERVICES PLATFORM, WE WILL BRING A

BROAD RANGE OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICE OFFERINGS TO MARKET THAT TARGET THE NEEDS OF LARGE ENTERPRISES, SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES, AND CONSUMERS.

EXPANDING OUR PRESENCE ON THE DESKTOP, THE SERVER, AND WITH DEVELOPERS.

WE BELIEVE WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO BUILD ON OUR STRENGTH WITH BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES AND WITH DEVELOPERS. FISCAL YEAR 2008

SAW WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF WINDOWS VISTA AND THE 2007 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND THE LAUNCH OF WINDOWS SERVER 2008, SQL SERVER 2008, AND VISUAL STUDIO 2008. WE WILL CONTINUE TO FOCUS EXPANDING ADOPTION OF THESE PRODUCTS IN FISCAL YEAR 2009, AND IN

PROVIDING ADDITIONAL VALUE IN SECURITY, MESSAGING, SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT, AND COLLABORATION. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO FOCUS ON DEVELOPERS WITH THE RELEASE OF NEW TOOLS SUCH AS SILVERLIGHT. WE WILL CONTINUE TO PURSUE NEW OPPORTUNITIES IN HIGH-PERFORMANCE

COMPUTING, UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS, HEALTHCARE, AND BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE. EMERGING MARKETS ARE ALSO AN IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITY FOR US.

DISTRIBUTION,

SALES AND MARKETING

WE DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH THE FOLLOWING CHANNELS: OEM; DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS; AND ONLINE.

OEM.

OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS ARE LICENSED PRIMARILY TO OEMS UNDER AGREEMENTS THAT GRANT OEMS THE RIGHT TO BUILD

COMPUTING DEVICES BASED ON OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS, PRINCIPALLY PCS. UNDER SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS, WE ALSO MARKET AND LICENSE CERTAIN SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS, DESKTOP APPLICATIONS, HARDWARE DEVICES, AND CONSUMER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS TO OEMS. WE HAVE OEM

AGREEMENTS COVERING ONE OR MORE OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE MAJOR PC OEMS, INCLUDING ACER, DELL, FUJITSU, FUJITSU SIEMENS COMPUTERS, GATEWAY, HEWLETT-PACKARD, LENOVO, NEC, SAMSUNG, SONY, AND TOSHIBA. A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF OEM

BUSINESS IS ALSO CONDUCTED WITH SYSTEM BUILDERS, WHICH ARE LOW-VOLUME, CUSTOMIZED PC VENDORS OPERATING IN LOCAL MARKETS.

DISTRIBUTORS AND

RESELLERS.

WE LICENSE SOFTWARE TO ORGANIZATIONS UNDER ARRANGEMENTS THAT ALLOW THE END-USER CUSTOMER TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCTS. ORGANIZATIONS LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH LARGE ACCOUNT RESELLERS

(LARS), DIRECT MARKET RESELLERS, AND VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS (VARS). MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT LICENSE PRODUCTS THROUGH ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS TRANSACT DIRECTLY WITH US, WITH SALES SUPPORT FROM OUR ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISOR

CHANNEL PARTNERS. THESE ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE ADVISORS TYPICALLY ARE ALSO AUTHORIZED AS LARS AND OPERATE AS RESELLERS FOR OUR OTHER LICENSING PROGRAMS. ALTHOUGH EACH TYPE OF RESELLING PARTNER REACHES ORGANIZATIONS OF ALL SIZES,

PAGE

PART I

ITEM 1

LARS ARE PRIMARILY ENGAGED WITH LARGE ORGANIZATIONS AND VARS TYPICALLY REACH THE SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS. SOME OF OUR DISTRIBUTORS INCLUDE INGRAM MICRO

AND TECH DATA, AND SOME OF OUR LARGEST RESELLERS INCLUDE CDW, DELL, INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, SOFTWARE HOUSE INTERNATIONAL, AND SOFTWARE SPECTRUM. OUR MICROSOFT DYNAMICS SOFTWARE OFFERINGS ARE LICENSED TO ENTERPRISES THROUGH A GLOBAL NETWORK OF CHANNEL

PARTNERS PROVIDING VERTICAL SOLUTIONS AND SPECIALIZED SERVICES. WE DISTRIBUTE OUR FINISHED GOODS PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT NON-EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORS, AUTHORIZED REPLICATORS, RESELLERS, AND RETAIL OUTLETS. INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS OBTAIN

OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH RETAIL OUTLETS, INCLUDING BEST BUY, TARGET, AND WAL-MART. WE HAVE A NETWORK OF FIELD SALES REPRESENTATIVES AND FIELD SUPPORT PERSONNEL THAT SOLICITS ORDERS FROM DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS AND PROVIDES PRODUCT TRAINING

AND SALES SUPPORT.

OUR ARRANGEMENTS FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCTS ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THEM WITH A

MEANS OF DOING SO WITHOUT HAVING TO ACQUIRE SEPARATE PACKAGED PRODUCT THROUGH RETAIL CHANNELS. IN DELIVERING ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS TO THE MARKET, WE USE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONS OF VARIOUS

SIZES. WHILE THESE PROGRAMS MAY DIFFER IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD, GENERALLY THEY INCLUDE.

OPEN

LICENSING.

DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR SMALL-TO-MEDIUM ORGANIZATIONS (5 TO OVER 250 LICENSES), THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY TWO YEARS). THE OFFERING THAT CONVEYS RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE PRODUCT OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD IS CALLED SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. SOFTWARE ASSURANCE ALSO PROVIDES SUPPORT,

TOOLS, AND TRAINING TO HELP CUSTOMERS DEPLOY AND USE SOFTWARE EFFICIENTLY. UNDER THE OPEN PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS CAN ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY, OR LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. THEY CAN ALSO RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING

VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS.

SELECT LICENSING.

DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR MEDIUM-TO-LARGE

ORGANIZATIONS (GREATER THAN 250 LICENSES), THIS PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, WHICH CONSISTS OF RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, SUPPORT,

TOOLS, AND TRAINING OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY THREE YEARS). SIMILAR TO THE OPEN PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS CAN ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY, ACQUIRE LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, OR RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING VOLUME

LICENSING AGREEMENTS.

ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT LICENSING.

THE ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT IS TARGETED AT

MEDIUM AND LARGE ORGANIZATIONS THAT WANT TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES TO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS FOR ALL OR SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF THEIR ENTERPRISE, ALONG WITH RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, SUPPORT, TOOLS, AND TRAINING OVER A

SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY THREE YEARS).

ONLINE.

WE DISTRIBUTE ONLINE CONTENT AND SERVICES THROUGH LIVE SEARCH,

WINDOWS LIVE, OFFICE LIVE, OUR MSN PORTALS AND CHANNELS, THE MICROSOFT ONLINE SERVICES PLATFORM, WHICH INCLUDES OFFERINGS FOR BUSINESS, AND OTHER ONLINE CHANNELS. OSB DELIVERS INTERNET ACCESS AND VARIOUS PREMIUM SERVICES AND TOOLS TO CONSUMERS. OSB

ALSO DELIVERS ONLINE EMAIL AND MESSAGING COMMUNICATION SERVICES AND INFORMATION SERVICES SUCH AS ONLINE SEARCH, ADVERTISING, AND PREMIUM CONTENT. EDD OPERATES THE XBOX LIVE SERVICE WHICH ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO PARTICIPATE IN THE GAMING EXPERIENCE

ONLINE WITH OTHER SUBSCRIBERS. WE OPERATE AND DELIVER THE MICROSOFT SMALL BUSINESS CENTER PORTAL. THIS PORTAL PROVIDES TOOLS AND EXPERTISE FOR SMALL-BUSINESS OWNERS TO BUILD, MARKET, AND MANAGE THEIR BUSINESSES ONLINE. OTHER SERVICES DELIVERED

ONLINE INCLUDE MICROSOFT DEVELOPER NETWORKS SUBSCRIPTION CONTENT AND UPDATES, PERIODIC PRODUCT UPDATES, AND ONLINE TECHNICAL AND PRACTICE READINESS RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR PARTNERS IN DEVELOPING AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS.

CUSTOMERS

OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS,

SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS, ENTERPRISES, GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, APPLICATION DEVELOPERS, AND OEMS. CONSUMERS AND SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS OBTAIN OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY

THROUGH RESELLERS AND OEMS. NO SALES TO AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF FISCAL YEAR 2008 OR 2007 REVENUE. SALES TO DELL AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES ACCOUNTED FOR APPROXIMATELY 11% OF FISCAL YEAR 2006 REVENUE. THESE SALES WERE MADE

PRIMARILY THROUGH OUR OEM AND VOLUME LICENSING CHANNELS AND COVER A BROAD ARRAY OF PRODUCTS INCLUDING WINDOWS PC OPERATING SYSTEMS, MICROSOFT OFFICE, AND SERVER PRODUCTS. OUR PRACTICE IS TO SHIP OUR PRODUCTS PROMPTLY UPON RECEIPT OF PURCHASE ORDERS

FROM CUSTOMERS; CONSEQUENTLY, BACKLOG IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF JUNE 30, 2008, WE EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 91,000 PEOPLE ON A FULL-TIME BASIS, 55,000 IN THE UNITED STATES AND 36,000 INTERNATIONALLY.

OF THE TOTAL, 35,000 WERE IN PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, 26,000 IN SALES AND MARKETING, 17,000 IN PRODUCT SUPPORT AND CONSULTING SERVICES, 4,000 IN MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION, AND 9,000 IN GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATION. OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY

DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. NONE OF OUR EMPLOYEES ARE SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.

AVAILABLE INFORMATION

OUR INTERNET ADDRESS IS WWW.MICROSOFT.COM. THERE WE MAKE AVAILABLE, FREE OF CHARGE, OUR ANNUAL REPORT ON FORM

10-K, QUARTERLY REPORTS ON FORM 10-Q, CURRENT REPORTS ON FORM 8-K, AND ANY AMENDMENTS TO THOSE REPORTS, AS SOON AS REASONABLY PRACTICABLE AFTER WE ELECTRONICALLY FILE SUCH MATERIAL WITH OR FURNISH IT TO THE SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION

(SEC). OUR SEC REPORTS CAN BE ACCESSED THROUGH THE INVESTOR RELATIONS SECTION OF OUR WEB SITE. THE INFORMATION FOUND ON OUR WEB SITE IS NOT PART OF THIS OR ANY OTHER REPORT WE FILE WITH OR FURNISH TO THE SEC.

ITEM 1A.    RISK FACTORS

OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH FLOWS, AND THE

TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

CHALLENGES TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL MAY REDUCE OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING MARGINS.

OUR

BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN BASED UPON CUSTOMERS PAYING A FEE TO LICENSE SOFTWARE THAT WE DEVELOP AND DISTRIBUTE. UNDER THIS LICENSE-BASED SOFTWARE MODEL, SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS BEAR THE COSTS OF CONVERTING ORIGINAL IDEAS INTO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THROUGH

INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OFFSETTING THESE COSTS WITH THE REVENUE RECEIVED FROM THE DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR PRODUCTS. CERTAIN OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE BUSINESS MODELS CHALLENGE OUR LICENSE-BASED SOFTWARE MODEL. OPEN SOURCE

COMMONLY REFERS TO SOFTWARE WHOSE SOURCE CODE IS SUBJECT TO A LICENSE ALLOWING IT TO BE MODIFIED, COMBINED WITH OTHER SOFTWARE AND REDISTRIBUTED, SUBJECT TO RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THE LICENSE. A NUMBER OF COMMERCIAL FIRMS COMPETE WITH US USING AN

OPEN SOURCE BUSINESS MODEL BY MODIFYING AND THEN DISTRIBUTING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE TO END USERS AT NOMINAL COST AND EARNING REVENUE ON COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. THESE FIRMS DO NOT BEAR THE FULL COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE

SOFTWARE. SOME OF THESE FIRMS MAY BUILD UPON MICROSOFT IDEAS THAT WE PROVIDE TO THEM FREE OR AT LOW ROYALTIES IN CONNECTION WITH OUR INTEROPERABILITY INITIATIVES. TO THE EXTENT OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE GAINS INCREASING MARKET ACCEPTANCE, OUR SALES,

REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS MAY DECLINE.

PART I

ITEM 1A

ANOTHER DEVELOPMENT IS THE BUSINESS

MODEL UNDER WHICH COMPANIES PROVIDE CONTENT, AND SOFTWARE IN THE FORM OF APPLICATIONS, DATA, AND RELATED SERVICES, OVER THE INTERNET IN EXCHANGE FOR REVENUES PRIMARILY FROM ADVERTISING OR SUBSCRIPTIONS. AN EXAMPLE OF AN ADVERTISING-FUNDED BUSINESS

MODEL IS INTERNET SEARCH, WHERE PROVIDING A ROBUST ALTERNATIVE IS PARTICULARLY IMPORTANT AND CHALLENGING DUE TO THE SCALE EFFECTS ENJOYED BY A SINGLE MARKET DOMINANT COMPETITOR. ADVANCES IN COMPUTING AND COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGIES HAVE MADE THIS

MODEL VIABLE AND ENABLED THE RAPID GROWTH OF SOME OF OUR COMPETITORS. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TOWARD DEVELOPING OUR OWN COMPETING SOFTWARE PLUS SERVICES STRATEGIES. IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER THESE STRATEGIES WILL BE SUCCESSFUL.

AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN TO CREATE PLATFORM-BASED ECOSYSTEMS ON WHICH MANY PARTICIPANTS CAN BUILD DIVERSE

SOLUTIONS. A COMPETING VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED MODEL, IN WHICH A SINGLE FIRM CONTROLS BOTH THE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ELEMENTS OF A PRODUCT, HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL WITH CERTAIN CONSUMER PRODUCTS SUCH AS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, MOBILE PHONES AND DIGITAL MUSIC

PLAYERS. WE ALSO OFFER VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS; HOWEVER, EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH THE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MODEL MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF SALES AND REDUCE OPERATING MARGINS.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION.

WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE INTENSE COMPETITION ACROSS ALL MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR

COMPETITORS RANGE IN SIZE FROM FORTUNE 100 COMPANIES TO SMALL, SPECIALIZED SINGLE-PRODUCT BUSINESSES AND OPEN SOURCE COMMUNITY-BASED PROJECTS. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE THE BREADTH OF OUR BUSINESSES AND PRODUCT PORTFOLIO IS A COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGE, OUR

COMPETITORS THAT ARE FOCUSED ON NARROWER PRODUCT LINES MAY BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEVOTING TECHNICAL, MARKETING, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES TO COMPETE WITH US. IN ADDITION, BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN OUR BUSINESSES GENERALLY ARE LOW AND PRODUCTS, ONCE

DEVELOPED, CAN BE DISTRIBUTED BROADLY AND QUICKLY AT RELATIVELY LOW COST. OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE VENDORS ARE DEVOTING CONSIDERABLE EFFORTS TO DEVELOPING SOFTWARE THAT MIMICS THE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, IN SOME CASES ON THE BASIS OF

TECHNICAL SPECIFICATIONS FOR MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE MAKE AVAILABLE. IN RESPONSE TO COMPETITION, WE ARE DEVELOPING VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS WITH BASIC FUNCTIONALITY THAT ARE SOLD AT LOWER PRICES THAN THE STANDARD VERSIONS. THESE COMPETITIVE

PRESSURES MAY RESULT IN DECREASED SALES VOLUMES, PRICE REDUCTIONS, AND/OR INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, SUCH AS FOR MARKETING AND SALES INCENTIVES, RESULTING IN LOWER REVENUE, GROSS MARGINS AND OPERATING INCOME.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

PROTECTING OUR GLOBAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND

COMBATING UNLICENSED COPYING AND USE OF SOFTWARE AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DIFFICULT. WHILE PIRACY ADVERSELY AFFECTS U.S. REVENUE, THE IMPACT ON REVENUE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS MORE SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE LAWS ARE

LESS PROTECTIVE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. SIMILARLY, THE ABSENCE OF HARMONIZED PATENT LAWS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENSURE CONSISTENT RESPECT FOR PATENT RIGHTS. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WE ACTIVELY EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE BENEFITS OF

LICENSING GENUINE PRODUCTS AND OBTAINING INDEMNIFICATION BENEFITS FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS, AND WE EDUCATE LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF A BUSINESS CLIMATE WHERE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. HOWEVER, CONTINUED EDUCATIONAL

AND ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS MAY FAIL TO ENHANCE REVENUE. REDUCTIONS IN THE LEGAL PROTECTION FOR SOFTWARE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUE.

THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME WE RECEIVE NOTICES FROM OTHERS CLAIMING WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE NUMBER OF THESE

CLAIMS MAY GROW. TO RESOLVE THESE CLAIMS WE MAY ENTER INTO ROYALTY AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS ON LESS FAVORABLE TERMS, STOP SELLING OR REDESIGN AFFECTED PRODUCTS, OR PAY DAMAGES TO SATISFY INDEMNIFICATION COMMITMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. SUCH

AGREEMENTS MAY CAUSE OPERATING MARGINS TO DECLINE. WE HAVE MADE AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE MAKING SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES TO SETTLE CLAIMS RELATED TO THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO MANAGE THIS RISK.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR SOURCE CODE FROM COPYING IF THERE IS AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE

CODE.

SOURCE CODE, THE DETAILED PROGRAM COMMANDS FOR OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND OTHER SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH WE LICENSE PORTIONS OF OUR APPLICATION AND OPERATING SYSTEM SOURCE CODE TO A

NUMBER OF LICENSEES, WE TAKE SIGNIFICANT MEASURES TO PROTECT THE SECRECY OF LARGE PORTIONS OF OUR SOURCE CODE. IF AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SOURCE CODE OCCURS, WE COULD POTENTIALLY LOSE FUTURE TRADE SECRET PROTECTION

FOR THAT SOURCE CODE. THIS COULD MAKE IT EASIER FOR THIRD PARTIES TO COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS BY COPYING FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE CODE ALSO COULD INCREASE THE

SECURITY RISKS DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

ITEM 1A

SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IN OUR PRODUCTS COULD LEAD

TO REDUCED REVENUES OR TO LIABILITY CLAIMS.

MAINTAINING THE SECURITY OF COMPUTERS AND COMPUTER NETWORKS IS A CRITICAL ISSUE FOR US AND OUR CUSTOMERS. HACKERS DEVELOP AND DEPLOY VIRUSES, WORMS, AND OTHER MALICIOUS SOFTWARE

PROGRAMS THAT ATTACK OUR PRODUCTS. ALTHOUGH THIS IS AN INDUSTRY- WIDE PROBLEM THAT AFFECTS COMPUTERS ACROSS ALL PLATFORMS, IT AFFECTS OUR PRODUCTS IN PARTICULAR BECAUSE HACKERS TEND TO FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON THE MOST POPULAR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND

PROGRAMS AND WE EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE TO DO SO. WE DEVOTE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO ADDRESS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES THROUGH.



ENGINEERING MORE SECURE PRODUCTS;



ENHANCING SECURITY AND RELIABILITY FEATURES IN OUR PRODUCTS;



HELPING OUR CUSTOMERS MAKE THE BEST USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO PROTECT AGAINST COMPUTER VIRUSES AND OTHER ATTACKS;



IMPROVING THE DEPLOYMENT OF SOFTWARE UPDATES TO ADDRESS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES;



INVESTING IN MITIGATION TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP TO SECURE CUSTOMERS FROM ATTACKS EVEN WHEN SUCH SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE NOT DEPLOYED; AND



PROVIDING CUSTOMERS ONLINE AUTOMATED SECURITY TOOLS, PUBLISHED SECURITY GUIDANCE, AND SECURITY SOFTWARE SUCH AS FIREWALLS, ANTI-VIRUS, AND OTHER SECURITY SOFTWARE.

THE COST OF THESE STEPS COULD REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS. DESPITE THESE EFFORTS, ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED SECURITY

VULNERABILITIES IN OUR PRODUCTS COULD LEAD SOME CUSTOMERS TO SEEK TO RETURN PRODUCTS, TO REDUCE OR DELAY FUTURE PURCHASES, OR TO USE COMPETING PRODUCTS. CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO INCREASE THEIR EXPENDITURES ON PROTECTING THEIR EXISTING COMPUTER SYSTEMS

FROM ATTACK, WHICH COULD DELAY ADOPTION OF NEW TECHNOLOGIES. ANY OF THESE ACTIONS BY CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. IN ADDITION, ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED VULNERABILITIES MAY LEAD TO CLAIMS AGAINST US. ALTHOUGH OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS

TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE OR LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO SUCH LIABILITY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THESE PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND ALL LEGAL CHALLENGES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIVITY THAT AFFECTS HOW WE DESIGN AND MARKET OUR PRODUCTS.

AS A LEADING GLOBAL SOFTWARE MAKER, WE RECEIVE CLOSE SCRUTINY FROM GOVERNMENT

AGENCIES UNDER U.S. AND FOREIGN COMPETITION LAWS. SOME JURISDICTIONS ALSO PROVIDE PRIVATE RIGHTS OF ACTION FOR COMPETITORS OR CONSUMERS TO ASSERT CLAIMS OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT. FOR EXAMPLE, WE HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS.

LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 18 STATES, AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN TWO SEPARATE ACTIONS WERE RESOLVED

THROUGH A CONSENT DECREE THAT TOOK EFFECT IN 2001 AND A FINAL JUDGMENT ENTERED IN 2002. THESE PROCEEDINGS IMPOSED VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS ON OUR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM BUSINESSES. THESE CONSTRAINTS INCLUDE LIMITS ON CERTAIN CONTRACTING PRACTICES,

MANDATED DISCLOSURE OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE PROGRAM INTERFACES AND PROTOCOLS, AND RIGHTS FOR COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS TO LIMIT THE VISIBILITY OF CERTAIN WINDOWS FEATURES IN NEW PCS. WE BELIEVE WE ARE IN FULL COMPLIANCE WITH THESE RULES. HOWEVER, IF WE

FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THEM, ADDITIONAL RESTRICTIONS COULD BE IMPOSED ON US THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

THE EUROPEAN

COMMISSION CLOSELY SCRUTINIZES THE DESIGN OF HIGH-VOLUME MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND THE TERMS ON WHICH WE MAKE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES USED IN THESE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS FILE FORMATS, PROGRAMMING INTERFACES, AND PROTOCOLS, AVAILABLE TO OTHER COMPANIES. IN

2004, THE COMMISSION ORDERED US TO CREATE NEW VERSIONS OF WINDOWS THAT DO NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN MULTIMEDIA TECHNOLOGIES AND TO PROVIDE OUR COMPETITORS WITH SPECIFICATIONS FOR HOW TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN PROPRIETARY WINDOWS COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS IN

THEIR OWN PRODUCTS. THE COMMISSIONS IMPACT ON PRODUCT DESIGN MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO INNOVATE IN WINDOWS OR OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE, DIMINISH THE DEVELOPER APPEAL OF THE WINDOWS PLATFORM, AND INCREASE OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. THE

AVAILABILITY OF LICENSES RELATED TO PROTOCOLS AND FILE FORMATS MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT BETTER MIMIC THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR OWN PRODUCTS WHICH COULD RESULT IN DECREASED SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

GOVERNMENT REGULATORY ACTIONS AND COURT DECISIONS MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE BENEFITS OF OUR SOFTWARE TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES,

THEREBY REDUCING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE REVENUES THAT COME FROM THEM. NEW ACTIONS COULD BE INITIATED AT ANY TIME, EITHER BY THESE OR OTHER GOVERNMENTS OR PRIVATE CLAIMANTS, INCLUDING WITH RESPECT TO NEW VERSIONS OF WINDOWS OR

OTHER MICROSOFT PRODUCTS. THE OUTCOME OF SUCH ACTIONS, OR STEPS TAKEN TO AVOID THEM, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN A VARIETY OF WAYS, INCLUDING.



WE MAY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WITHDRAWING PRODUCTS FROM CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES TO AVOID FINES OR DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS OF THOSE PRODUCTS TO COMPLY

WITH GOVERNMENT RULINGS, WHICH MAY ENTAIL REMOVING FUNCTIONALITY THAT CUSTOMERS WANT OR ON WHICH DEVELOPERS RELY.



WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE AVAILABLE LICENSES TO OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES ON TERMS THAT DO NOT REFLECT THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE OR DO NOT PROTECT OUR ASSOCIATED

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.



THE RULINGS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY BE CITED AS A PRECEDENT IN OTHER COMPETITION LAW PROCEEDINGS.

OUR SOFTWARE AND SERVICES ONLINE OFFERINGS ARE SUBJECT TO GOVERNMENT REGULATION OF THE INTERNET DOMESTICALLY AND INTERNATIONALLY IN MANY AREAS,

INCLUDING USER PRIVACY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, DATA PROTECTION, AND ONLINE CONTENT. THE APPLICATION OF THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO OUR BUSINESS IS OFTEN UNCLEAR AND SOMETIMES MAY CONFLICT. COMPLIANCE WITH THESE REGULATIONS MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT

COSTS OR REQUIRE CHANGES IN BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE. NONCOMPLIANCE COULD RESULT IN PENALTIES BEING IMPOSED ON US OR ORDERS THAT WE STOP DOING THE ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANT ACTIVITY.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESS IS BASED ON SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACTING AND

RETAINING TALENTED EMPLOYEES. THE MARKET FOR HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS AND LEADERS IN OUR INDUSTRY IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT INTERNATIONALLY BY RESTRICTIVE DOMESTIC IMMIGRATION LAWS. IF WE ARE LESS SUCCESSFUL IN

OUR RECRUITING EFFORTS, OR IF WE ARE UNABLE TO RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. EFFECTIVE SUCCESSION PLANNING IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS. FAILURE TO

ENSURE EFFECTIVE TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE AND SMOOTH TRANSITIONS INVOLVING KEY EMPLOYEES COULD HINDER OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING AND EXECUTION.

DELAYS

IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT SCHEDULES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS A COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS. NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS CAN REQUIRE LONG

DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PERIODS. OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON SOFTWARE PLUS SERVICES ALSO PRESENTS NEW AND COMPLEX DEVELOPMENT ISSUES. SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN NEW PRODUCT OR SERVICE RELEASES OR SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN CREATING NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES

COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT MAY NOT BE

PROFITABLE.

WE HAVE MADE AND WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING FOR NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING WINDOWS VISTA, THE 2007 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM,

XBOX 360, LIVE SEARCH, WINDOWS SERVER, ZUNE, AND WINDOWS LIVE. INVESTMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGY ARE SPECULATIVE. COMMERCIAL SUCCESS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS, INCLUDING INNOVATIVENESS, DEVELOPER SUPPORT, AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING. WE MAY

NOT ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM NEW PRODUCT AND SERVICE INVESTMENTS FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, IF AT ALL. MOREOVER, NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE, AND EVEN IF THEY ARE PROFITABLE, OPERATING MARGINS FOR NEW PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES

MAY NOT BE AS HIGH AS THE MARGINS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORICALLY.

ADVERSE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS MAY HARM OUR

BUSINESS.

INFLATION, SOFTNESS IN CORPORATE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SPENDING, OR OTHER CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THAT AFFECT DEMAND FOR COMPUTER HARDWARE OR SOFTWARE COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE OR OUR INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO. IF DEMAND FOR PCS, SERVERS, AND OTHER COMPUTING DEVICES DECLINES SIGNIFICANTLY, OR CONSUMER OR CORPORATE SPENDING FOR SUCH PRODUCTS DECLINES, OUR REVENUE WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. IN ADDITION, OUR REVENUE MAY BE UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED IF

CUSTOMERS REDUCE THEIR PURCHASES OF NEW SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES BECAUSE NEW OFFERINGS SUCH AS WINDOWS VISTA AND THE 2007 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM ARE NOT PERCEIVED AS PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNCTIONALITY OR OTHER VALUE TO PROSPECTIVE

PURCHASERS.

WE HAVE CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AGAINST US THAT MAY RESULT IN ADVERSE OUTCOMES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF

CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS. ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN SOME OR ALL OF THESE CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES RESOLVING

ALL OF THESE MATTERS, INDIVIDUALLY OR IN THE AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS, THE LITIGATION AND OTHER CLAIMS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND

MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, AND CASH FLOWS ALSO COULD OCCUR FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECT OF AN UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOME BECOMES

PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES IN THE

UNITED STATES AND MANY FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX

DETERMINATION IS

ITEM 1A

UNCERTAIN. WE REGULARLY ARE UNDER AUDIT BY TAX AUTHORITIES. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF TAX AUDITS AND ANY RELATED

LITIGATION COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. THE RESULTS OF AN AUDIT OR LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS IN THE PERIOD OR

PERIODS FOR WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE.

OUR VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR SUPPLY

PROBLEMS

.    OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS SUCH AS THE XBOX 360 CONSOLE ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND CAN HAVE DEFECTS IN DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, OR ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE. WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, LOST REVENUE, AND REPUTATIONAL HARM

IF WE FAIL TO DETECT OR EFFECTIVELY ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES THROUGH DESIGN, TESTING, OR WARRANTY REPAIRS. WE OBTAIN SOME COMPONENTS OF OUR HARDWARE DEVICES FROM SOLE SUPPLIERS. IF A COMPONENT DELIVERY FROM A SOLE-SOURCE SUPPLIER IS DELAYED OR BECOMES

UNAVAILABLE OR INDUSTRY SHORTAGES OCCUR, WE MAY BE UNABLE TO OBTAIN TIMELY REPLACEMENT SUPPLIES, RESULTING IN REDUCED SALES. EITHER COMPONENT SHORTAGES OR EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY MAY REQUIRE US TO RECORD CHARGES TO COST OF REVENUE. XBOX 360

CONSOLES ARE ASSEMBLED IN ASIA; DISRUPTIONS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN MAY RESULT IN CONSOLE SHORTAGES THAT WOULD AFFECT OUR REVENUES AND OPERATING MARGINS. THESE SAME RISKS WOULD APPLY TO ANY OTHER VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE

MAY OFFER.

IF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME IMPAIRED WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO

EARNINGS.

UNDER GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, WE REVIEW OUR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. GOODWILL IS

TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. FACTORS THAT MAY BE CONSIDERED A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES, INDICATING THAT THE CARRYING VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, INCLUDE A DECLINE IN STOCK PRICE AND

MARKET CAPITALIZATION, REDUCED FUTURE CASH FLOW ESTIMATES, AND SLOWER GROWTH RATES IN OUR INDUSTRY. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH ANY IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL OR

AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS DETERMINED, NEGATIVELY IMPACTING OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

WE OPERATE A GLOBAL BUSINESS THAT EXPOSES US TO

ADDITIONAL RISKS.

WE OPERATE IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES AND A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES. PRESSURE TO MAKE OUR PRICING STRUCTURE UNIFORM MIGHT REQUIRE THAT WE REDUCE THE SALES PRICE OF OUR

SOFTWARE IN THE UNITED STATES AND OTHER COUNTRIES. OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TRADE PROTECTION LAWS, POLICIES AND MEASURES, AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT; CHANGES IN

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR SOFTWARE; SOCIAL, POLITICAL, LABOR OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION; AND DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING FOREIGN OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY EXPOSURE,

SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR NET REVENUES.

CATASTROPHIC

EVENTS OR GEO-POLITICAL CONDITIONS MAY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS.

A DISRUPTION OR FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEMS OR OPERATIONS IN THE EVENT OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE, WEATHER EVENT, CYBER-ATTACK, TERRORIST ATTACK, OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC

EVENT COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN COMPLETING SALES, PROVIDING SERVICES OR PERFORMING OTHER MISSION-CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER CRITICAL BUSINESS

OPERATIONS ARE LOCATED IN THE SEATTLE, WASHINGTON AREA, AND WE HAVE OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF CALIFORNIA, BOTH OF WHICH ARE NEAR MAJOR EARTHQUAKE FAULTS. A CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT RESULTS IN THE DESTRUCTION OR

DISRUPTION OF ANY OF OUR CRITICAL BUSINESS OR INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY SYSTEMS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS AND OUR OPERATING RESULTS. ABRUPT POLITICAL CHANGE, TERRORIST ACTIVITY, AND ARMED CONFLICT POSE A RISK OF

GENERAL ECONOMIC DISRUPTION IN AFFECTED COUNTRIES, WHICH MAY INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. THESE CONDITIONS ALSO MAY ADD UNCERTAINTY TO THE TIMING AND BUDGET FOR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT DECISIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS.

ACQUISITIONS AND JOINT VENTURES MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE EXPECT TO CONTINUE MAKING ACQUISITIONS OR ENTERING

INTO JOINT VENTURES AS PART OF OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS STRATEGY. THESE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS INCLUDING THAT THE TRANSACTION DOES NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY, THAT WE DONT REALIZE A SATISFACTORY RETURN ON

OUR INVESTMENT, OR THAT WE EXPERIENCE DIFFICULTY IN THE INTEGRATION OF NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY, OR DIVERSION OF MANAGEMENTS ATTENTION FROM OUR OTHER BUSINESSES. THESE EVENTS COULD HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL

CONDITION.

IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA COULD RESULT IN

LIABILITY AND HARM OUR REPUTATION.

WE STORE AND PROCESS LARGE AMOUNTS OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT OUR SECURITY CONTROLS OVER PERSONAL DATA, OUR TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES AND VENDORS ON DATA

SECURITY, AND OTHER PRACTICES WE FOLLOW MAY NOT PREVENT THE IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION. SUCH DISCLOSURE COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION AND SUBJECT US TO LIABILITY UNDER LAWS THAT PROTECT PERSONAL DATA, RESULTING IN

INCREASED COSTS OR LOSS OF REVENUE. OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ALSO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO STORE AND PROCESS PERSONAL DATA. PERCEPTIONS THAT OUR PRODUCTS DO NOT ADEQUATELY PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION COULD INHIBIT SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

WE MAY EXPERIENCE OUTAGES AND DISRUPTIONS OF OUR ONLINE SERVICES IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE OPERATIONS

INFRASTRUCTURE.

OUR INCREASING USER TRAFFIC AND COMPLEXITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DEMAND MORE COMPUTING POWER. WE HAVE SPENT AND EXPECT TO CONTINUE TO SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS TO PURCHASE OR LEASE DATA CENTERS AND

EQUIPMENT AND TO UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TO HANDLE INCREASED TRAFFIC ON OUR WEB SITES AND TO INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND SUPPORT EXISTING SERVICES SUCH AS XBOX LIVE, WINDOWS LIVE, AND OFFICE LIVE. THIS EXPANSION

IS EXPENSIVE, COMPLEX, AND COULD RESULT IN INEFFICIENCIES OR OPERATIONAL FAILURES, WHICH COULD DIMINISH THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND USER EXPERIENCE, RESULTING IN DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND LOSS OF CURRENT AND POTENTIAL USERS,

SUBSCRIBERS, AND ADVERTISERS, HARMING OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

OTHER RISKS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR

BUSINESS.

OTHER FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT OUR PERFORMANCE MAY INCLUDE SALES CHANNEL DISRUPTION, SUCH AS THE BANKRUPTCY OF A MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR, AND OUR ABILITY TO IMPLEMENT OPERATING COST STRUCTURES THAT ALIGN WITH REVENUE

GROWTH.

ITEM 1B.    UNRESOLVED STAFF COMMENTS

ITEM 3.    LEGAL PROCEEDINGS

IN MARCH 2004, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ISSUED A

COMPETITION LAW DECISION THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ORDERED US TO LICENSE CERTAIN WINDOWS SERVER PROTOCOL TECHNOLOGY TO OUR COMPETITORS. IN MARCH 2007, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ISSUED A STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS CLAIMING THAT THE PRICING TERMS WE

PROPOSED FOR LICENSING THE TECHNOLOGY AS REQUIRED BY THE MARCH 2004 DECISION WERE NOT REASONABLE. FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL STEPS WE TOOK TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS, THE COMMISSION ANNOUNCED ON OCTOBER 22, 2007 THAT WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE

WITH THE MARCH 2004 DECISION AND THAT NO FURTHER PENALTY SHOULD BE IMPOSED FROM THAT DATE. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE COMMISSION ISSUED A FINE OF $1.4 BILLION (

MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF

FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

RESULTS OF OPERATIONS FOR FISCAL YEARS 2008, 2007, AND 2006

OVERVIEW

THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) IS INTENDED TO HELP THE READER UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL

CONDITION OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION. MD&A IS PROVIDED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH, OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (NOTES).

WE GENERATE REVENUE BY DEVELOPING, MANUFACTURING, LICENSING, AND SUPPORTING A WIDE RANGE OF

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES FOR MANY DIFFERENT TYPES OF COMPUTING DEVICES. OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INCLUDE OPERATING SYSTEMS FOR SERVERS, PERSONAL COMPUTERS, AND INTELLIGENT DEVICES; SERVER APPLICATIONS FOR DISTRIBUTED COMPUTING

ENVIRONMENTS; INFORMATION WORKER PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS; BUSINESS SOLUTIONS APPLICATIONS; HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING APPLICATIONS; SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT TOOLS; AND VIDEO GAMES. WE PROVIDE CONSULTING AND PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES, AND WE TRAIN AND

CERTIFY COMPUTER SYSTEM INTEGRATORS AND DEVELOPERS. WE ALSO DESIGN AND SELL HARDWARE INCLUDING THE XBOX 360 VIDEO GAME CONSOLE, THE ZUNE DIGITAL MUSIC AND ENTERTAINMENT DEVICE, AND PERIPHERALS. ONLINE OFFERINGS AND INFORMATION ARE DELIVERED THROUGH

LIVE SEARCH, WINDOWS LIVE, OFFICE LIVE, OUR MSN PORTALS AND CHANNELS, AND THE MICROSOFT ONLINE SERVICES PLATFORM WHICH INCLUDES OFFERINGS FOR BUSINESSES SUCH AS MICROSOFT DYNAMICS CRM ONLINE, EXCHANGE HOSTED SERVICES, EXCHANGE ONLINE, AND SHAREPOINT

ONLINE. WE ENABLE THE DELIVERY OF ONLINE ADVERTISING ACROSS OUR BROAD RANGE OF DIGITAL MEDIA PROPERTIES AND ON LIVE SEARCH THROUGH OUR PROPRIETARY ADCENTER® PLATFORM.

OUR REVENUE HISTORICALLY HAS FLUCTUATED QUARTERLY AND HAS GENERALLY BEEN THE HIGHEST IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF OUR FISCAL YEAR DUE TO CORPORATE CALENDAR YEAR-END SPENDING TRENDS IN OUR MAJOR MARKETS AND

HOLIDAY SEASON SPENDING BY CONSUMERS. OUR ENTERTAINMENT AND DEVICES DIVISION IS PARTICULARLY SEASONAL AS ITS PRODUCTS ARE AIMED AT THE CONSUMER MARKET AND ARE IN HIGHEST DEMAND DURING THE HOLIDAY SHOPPING SEASON. TYPICALLY, THE ENTERTAINMENT AND

DEVICES DIVISION HAS GENERATED OVER 40% OF ITS YEARLY SEGMENT REVENUES IN OUR SECOND FISCAL QUARTER. IN FISCAL YEAR 2007, OUR REVENUE WAS HIGHEST IN THE THIRD QUARTER DUE TO THE RECOGNITION OF $1.7 BILLION OF REVENUE PREVIOUSLY DEFERRED FROM THE

EXPRESS UPGRADE TO WINDOWS VISTA AND MICROSOFT OFFICE TECHNOLOGY GUARANTEE PROGRAMS AND PRE-SHIPMENTS OF WINDOWS VISTA AND THE 2007 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM. THE TECHNOLOGY GUARANTEE PROGRAMS PROVIDED CUSTOMERS WHO PURCHASED CURRENT PRODUCTS WITH

FREE OR DISCOUNTED RIGHTS TO WINDOWS VISTA AND THE 2007 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM WHEN THOSE PRODUCTS BECAME AVAILABLE TO CONSUMERS.

WE

INTEND TO SUSTAIN THE LONG-TERM GROWTH OF OUR BUSINESSES THROUGH TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION, ENGINEERING EXCELLENCE, AND A COMMITMENT TO DELIVERING HIGH-QUALITY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS. RECOGNIZING THAT ONE OF OUR PRIMARY

CHALLENGES IS TO HELP ACCELERATE WORLDWIDE PC ADOPTION AND SOFTWARE UPGRADES, WE CONTINUE TO ADVANCE THE FUNCTIONALITY, SECURITY, AND VALUE OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS AND TO DEVELOP OPERATING SYSTEM VERSIONS TARGETED AT EMERGING MARKETS. WE ALSO

ARE INCREASING OUR FOCUS ON SELLING OUR PRODUCTS IN EMERGING MARKETS AND REDUCING THE AMOUNT OF UNLICENSED SOFTWARE USED IN THOSE MARKETS. IN ADDITION, WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS AND SOLUTIONS THAT WE BELIEVE WILL

ENHANCE THE PRODUCTIVITY OF INFORMATION WORKERS, IMPROVE COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION IN WORK GROUPS, AID BUSINESS INTELLIGENCE, AND STREAMLINE PROCESSES FOR SMALL AND MID-SIZED BUSINESSES. TO SUSTAIN THE GROWTH OF OUR SERVER AND TOOLS BUSINESS

AMID COMPETITION FROM OTHER VENDORS OF PROPRIETARY AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, OUR GOAL IS TO DELIVER PRODUCTS THAT PROVIDE THE BEST PLATFORM FOR NETWORK COMPUTING  SOFTWARE THAT IS EASIEST TO DEPLOY AND MANAGE, AND THAT IS MOST SECURE 

WITH THE LOWEST TOTAL COST OF OWNERSHIP.

WE CONTINUE TO INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IN EXISTING AND NEW LINES OF BUSINESS,

INCLUDING ONLINE SOLUTIONS, BUSINESS SOLUTIONS, MOBILE COMPUTING, COMMUNICATION, ENTERTAINMENT, AND OTHER AREAS THAT WE BELIEVE MAY CONTRIBUTE TO OUR LONG-TERM GROWTH. WE ALSO INVEST IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES FOR FUTURE

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE THAT DELIVERING INNOVATIVE AND HIGH-VALUE SOLUTIONS THROUGH OUR INTEGRATED PLATFORM IS THE KEY TO MEETING CUSTOMER NEEDS AND TO OUR FUTURE GROWTH.

WE BELIEVE THAT OVER THE LAST FEW YEARS WE HAVE LAID A FOUNDATION FOR LONG-TERM GROWTH BY DELIVERING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, CREATING OPPORTUNITIES FOR PARTNERS, IMPROVING CUSTOMER SATISFACTION WITH KEY

AUDIENCES, AND IMPROVING OUR INTERNAL BUSINESS PROCESSES. OUR FOCUS IN FISCAL YEAR 2009 IS TO CONTINUE TO BUILD ON THIS FOUNDATION AND TO CONTINUE TO EXECUTE WELL IN KEY AREAS, INCLUDING CONTINUING TO INNOVATE ON OUR INTEGRATED SOFTWARE PLATFORM,

RESPONDING EFFECTIVELY TO CUSTOMER AND PARTNER NEEDS, AND CONTINUING TO FOCUS INTERNALLY ON PRODUCT EXCELLENCE, BUSINESS EFFICACY, AND ACCOUNTABILITY ACROSS THE COMPANY.

KEY MARKET OPPORTUNITIES INCLUDE.

CONSUMER TECHNOLOGY.

WE ARE FOCUSED ON DELIVERING CONSUMER

SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT WE BELIEVE ARE COMPELLING IN TERMS OF DESIGN, FEATURES, AND FUNCTIONALITY. WE ALSO ARE WORKING TO DEFINE THE NEXT ERA OF CONSUMER ELECTRONICS THROUGH THE DEVELOPMENT OF INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE THAT RUNS ON A WIDE RANGE OF DEVICES

AND CONNECTS PEOPLE QUICKLY AND EASILY TO THE INFORMATION, EXPERIENCES, AND COMMUNITIES THEY CARE ABOUT.

SOFTWARE PLUS

SERVICES.

THE ABILITY TO COMBINE THE POWER OF DESKTOP AND SERVER SOFTWARE WITH THE REACH OF THE INTERNET REPRESENTS AN OPPORTUNITY ACROSS EVERY ONE OF OUR BUSINESSES. WE BELIEVE OUR SOFTWARE PLUS SERVICES APPROACH WILL

ENABLE US TO DELIVER NEW EXPERIENCES TO END USERS AND NEW VALUE TO BUSINESSES.

EXPANDING OUR PRESENCE ON THE DESKTOP, THE SERVER,

AND WITH DEVELOPERS.

THROUGH OUR ABILITY TO DELIVER ADDITIONAL VALUE IN SECURITY, MESSAGING, SYSTEMS MANAGEMENT, AND COLLABORATION, AND NEW TECHNOLOGY FOR HIGH-PERFORMANCE COMPUTING, UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS, AND BUSINESS

INTELLIGENCE, WE BELIEVE WE ARE WELL-POSITIONED TO BUILD ON OUR STRENGTH WITH BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES AND WITH DEVELOPERS. FISCAL YEAR 2008 SAW WIDESPREAD ADOPTION OF WINDOWS VISTA AND THE 2007 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND THE LAUNCH OF WINDOWS

SERVER 2008, SQL SERVER 2008, AND VISUAL STUDIO 2008.

FISCAL YEAR 2008 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2007

REVENUE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY INCREASED LICENSING OF THE 2007 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, INCREASED XBOX 360 PLATFORM SALES, INCREASED REVENUE ASSOCIATED

WITH WINDOWS SERVER AND SQL SERVER, AND INCREASED LICENSING OF WINDOWS VISTA. FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES ACCOUNTED FOR A $1.6 BILLION OR THREE PERCENTAGE POINT INCREASE IN REVENUE DURING THE YEAR.

OPERATING INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY REFLECTING INCREASED REVENUE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES, INCREASED COSTS FOR

LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AND LEGAL CONTINGENCIES, AND INCREASED COST OF REVENUE. HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES INCREASED 12%, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DURING THE YEAR. WE INCURRED $1.8 BILLION OF LEGAL CHARGES DURING THE YEAR PRIMARILY RELATED TO

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FINE OF $1.4 BILLION (



899 MILLION) AS COMPARED WITH $511 MILLION OF LEGAL CHARGES DURING THE PRIOR YEAR. COST OF REVENUE INCREASED $905

MILLION OR 8%, REFLECTING INCREASED DATA CENTER AND EQUIPMENT COSTS, ONLINE CONTENT EXPENSES, AND INCREASED COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE GROWTH IN OUR CONSULTING SERVICES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY DECREASED XBOX 360 COSTS. THE DECREASED XBOX 360 COSTS

REFLECT THE $1.1 BILLION CHARGE IN FISCAL YEAR 2007 RELATED TO THE EXPANSION OF OUR XBOX 360 WARRANTY COVERAGE AS DISCUSSED BELOW, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED XBOX 360 PRODUCT COSTS REFLECTING GROWTH IN UNIT CONSOLE SALES.

THE DILUTED EARNINGS PER SHARE GROWTH WAS IMPACTED BY THE $1.1 BILLION XBOX 360 CHARGE IN FISCAL YEAR 2007 AND CURRENT YEAR SHARE REPURCHASES.

FISCAL YEAR 2007 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2006

REVENUE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LICENSING OF THE 2007 MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND WINDOWS VISTA, INCREASED REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH SQL SERVER, WINDOWS SERVER, AND VISUAL STUDIO, AND INCREASED XBOX 360 PLATFORM SALES. FOREIGN CURRENCY

EXCHANGE RATES DID NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON CONSOLIDATED REVENUE DURING THE YEAR.

OPERATING INCOME GROWTH WAS DRIVEN

PRIMARILY BY INCREASED REVENUE AND DECREASED COSTS FOR LEGAL SETTLEMENTS AND LEGAL CONTINGENCIES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY INCREASED COST OF REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH XBOX 360 AND WINDOWS VISTA, INCREASED OSB DATA CENTERS COSTS, AND INCREASED SALES AND

MARKETING EXPENSES. IN JULY 2007, WE EXPANDED OUR GLOBAL XBOX 360 WARRANTY COVERAGE TO THREE YEARS FROM THE DATE OF PURCHASE FOR A GENERAL HARDWARE FAILURE INDICATED BY THREE FLASHING RED LIGHTS. AS A RESULT, WE RECORDED A $1.1 BILLION CHARGE IN

FISCAL YEAR 2007 FOR ANTICIPATED COSTS UNDER THE WARRANTY POLICY, INVENTORY WRITE-DOWNS, AND PRODUCT RETURNS. THE INCREASE IN SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES

PAGE

TABLE OF CONTENTS

ITEM 7

WAS PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY INCREASED HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES AND MARKETING COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT LAUNCHES. HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES INCREASED 18%, DRIVEN BY AN

INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DURING THE YEAR.

FISCAL YEAR 2009 OUTLOOK

GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC FACTORS HAVE A STRONG CORRELATION TO DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, HARDWARE, AND ONLINE OFFERINGS. IN FISCAL YEAR 2009, WE EXPECT A BROAD CONTINUATION OF THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS

AND DEMAND WE EXPERIENCED DURING THE LATTER PART OF FISCAL YEAR 2008. IN FISCAL YEAR 2009, WE EXPECT DOUBLE DIGIT REVENUE GROWTH AND WE ESTIMATE PC SHIPMENTS WILL GROW BETWEEN 12% AND 14%. WITHIN THE OVERALL PC MARKET, WE EXPECT CURRENT TRENDS TO

CONTINUE WITH CONSUMER SEGMENT GROWTH EXCEEDING THAT OF THE BUSINESS SEGMENT AND EMERGING MARKET GROWTH EXCEEDING THAT OF MATURE MARKETS.

899 MILLION) AS COMPARED WITH $511 MILLION OF LEGAL CHARGES DURING FISCAL YEAR 2007. HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES

INCREASED 7% DURING FISCAL YEAR 2008, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DURING THE YEAR. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2007, WE INCURRED $511 MILLION OF LEGAL CHARGES PRIMARILY RELATED TO ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CONSUMER CLASS ACTIONS, INTELLECTUAL

PROPERTY CLAIMS, AND EXTENSION PAYMENT TO SUN MICROSYSTEMS, INC. AS COMPARED WITH $1.3 BILLION OF LEGAL CHARGES IN FISCAL YEAR 2006. HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES INCREASED 15% DURING FISCAL YEAR 2007, DRIVEN BY AN INCREASE IN HEADCOUNT DURING THE

FISCAL YEAR 2008 COMPARED

WITH FISCAL YEAR 2007

DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST INCOME DECREASED REFLECTING LOWER INTEREST RATES ON OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS AND A REDUCTION IN

THE AVERAGE BALANCE OF INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS OWNED. NET RECOGNIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF $312 MILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2008 AND $25 MILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2007, DECREASED PRIMARILY DUE

TO DECLINES IN EQUITY VALUES AS A RESULT OF THE RECENT STOCK MARKET DECLINE. NET GAINS ON DERIVATIVES INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO HIGHER NET GAINS ON EQUITY, COMMODITY, AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES. OTHER OF $138 MILLION INCLUDES THE CORRECTION OF

SEVERAL IMMATERIAL ITEMS FROM PRIOR PERIODS.

FISCAL YEAR 2007 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2006

DIVIDENDS AND INTEREST INCOME DECLINED REFLECTING A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE BALANCE OF DIVIDEND AND INTEREST-BEARING INVESTMENTS OWNED, PARTLY OFFSET BY HIGHER

INTEREST RATES RECEIVED ON OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS. NET RECOGNIZED GAINS ON INVESTMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS OF $25 MILLION DURING FISCAL YEAR 2007 AND $408 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2006, INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO

LOWER OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS AND GAINS ON SALES OF FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS AS COMPARED TO LOSSES IN FISCAL YEAR 2006, PARTLY OFFSET BY FEWER GAINS ON THE SALE OF EQUITY INVESTMENTS. DERIVATIVE LOSSES WERE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY NET LOSSES IN

TIME VALUE ON FOREIGN CURRENCY CONTRACTS USED TO HEDGE ANTICIPATED FOREIGN CURRENCY REVENUES. OTHER IN FISCAL YEAR 2006 INCLUDES $195 MILLION OF GAINS THAT RESULTED FROM THE RESTRUCTURING OF JOINT VENTURE RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND NBC

RELATED TO MSNBC CABLE L.L.C. AND MSNBC INTERACTIVE NEWS, L.L.C.

INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR

VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, WE

EVALUATE GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS

OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS, AND RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT

CHARGE IS RECORDED AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED.

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO

INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. COLLATERAL AND/OR SECURITY INTEREST IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH

COLLATERAL IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY.

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURES TO INTEREST

RATES, EQUITY PRICES, AND FOREIGN CURRENCY MARKETS AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. GAINS AND LOSSES ARISING FROM DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS ACCOUNTING HEDGES ARE IN LARGE PART ECONOMICALLY OFFSET BY UNREALIZED LOSSES AND GAINS,

RESPECTIVELY, IN THE UNDERLYING SECURITIES WHICH ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

INCOME TAXES

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR FISCAL YEARS 2008, 2007, AND 2006 WERE 26%, 30%, AND 31%, RESPECTIVELY. OUR

EFFECTIVE TAX RATES ARE LESS THAN THE STATUTORY TAX RATE DUE TO FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES. THE DECREASED RATE IN FISCAL YEAR 2008 RESULTED FROM RESOLUTION OF TAX POSITIONS RELATED TO OUR SETTLEMENT WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE SERVICE

(IRS) FOR ITS 2000-2003 EXAMINATION. THIS DECLINE WAS PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE TAX EFFECT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FINE OF $1.4 BILLION (



899 MILLION),

WHICH WAS NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE. THE FISCAL YEAR 2007 RATE REFLECTS A RECURRING EFFECTIVE TAX RATE OF 31%, OFFSET BY A $195 MILLION REDUCTION RESULTING FROM VARIOUS CHANGES IN TAX POSITIONS TAKEN IN PRIOR PERIODS, RELATED PRIMARILY TO FAVORABLE

DEVELOPMENTS IN AN IRS POSITION AND MULTIPLE FOREIGN AUDIT ASSESSMENTS. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2006, WE RECORDED A TAX BENEFIT OF $108 MILLION FROM THE RESOLUTION OF STATE AUDITS AND RECORDED A CHARGE OF $351 MILLION (



281 MILLION) FROM THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FINE WHICH WAS NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE.

ON JULY 1, 2007, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB) INTERPRETATION NO. 48 (FIN 48)

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN

INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109

, WHICH PROVIDES A FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. ADOPTING FIN 48 HAD THE FOLLOWING IMPACT ON OUR

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: INCREASED CURRENT ASSETS BY $228 MILLION, LONG-TERM ASSETS BY $1.1 BILLION, LONG-TERM LIABILITIES BY $2.1 BILLION, AND OUR RETAINED DEFICIT BY $395 MILLION; AND DECREASED OUR INCOME TAXES PAYABLE BY $394 MILLION. AS OF

JUNE 30, 2008, WE HAD $3.2 BILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF WHICH $2.3 BILLION, IF RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. AS OF JULY 1, 2007, WE HAD $7.1 BILLION OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS OF WHICH $5.3 BILLION, IF

RECOGNIZED, WOULD AFFECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE. OUR POLICY IS TO INCLUDE INTEREST AND PENALTIES RELATED TO UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS IN INCOME TAX EXPENSE. INTEREST TOTALED $121 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2008. AS OF JUNE 30, 2008 AND JULY 1,

2007, WE HAD ACCRUED INTEREST RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS OF $324 MILLION AND $863 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, NET OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX BENEFITS, ON OUR BALANCE SHEETS.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALED $23.7 BILLION AND

$23.4 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE $6.6 BILLION AND $10.1 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2008 AND 2007, RESPECTIVELY. OUR INVESTMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES,

DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. OUR INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIQUID AND INVESTMENT GRADE. THE PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED PREDOMINANTLY IN U.S.-DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDES FOREIGN-DENOMINATED SECURITIES IN ORDER

TO DIVERSIFY FINANCIAL RISK. AS A RESULT OF THE SPECIAL DIVIDEND PAID IN THE SECOND QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2005 AND SHARES REPURCHASED, OUR RETAINED DEFICIT, INCLUDING ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME, WAS $26.6 BILLION AT JUNE 30, 2008.

OUR RETAINED DEFICIT IS NOT EXPECTED TO IMPACT OUR FUTURE ABILITY TO OPERATE OR PAY DIVIDENDS GIVEN OUR CONTINUING PROFITABILITY AND STRONG CASH AND FINANCIAL POSITION.

IN GENERAL, AND WHERE APPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO PRICE POSITIONS. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO EXCHANGE-TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS,

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, U.S. TREASURIES, AND AGENCY SECURITIES. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO PRICE POSITIONS, THEN WE USE INPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE

OBSERVABLE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED USING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN IMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.

WHILE WE OWN CERTAIN MORTGAGE- AND ASSET-BACKED FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, OUR PORTFOLIO AS OF JUNE 30, 2008 DOES NOT CONTAIN DIRECT EXPOSURE TO SUBPRIME MORTGAGES OR STRUCTURED VEHICLES THAT DERIVE THEIR VALUE FROM SUBPRIME COLLATERAL.

THE MAJORITY OF THE MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES ARE COLLATERALIZED BY PRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGES AND CARRY A 100% PRINCIPAL AND INTEREST GUARANTEE, PRIMARILY FROM FEDERAL NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION, FEDERAL HOME LOAN MORTGAGE CORPORATION, AND

GOVERNMENT NATIONAL MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION. THE REMAINDER OF THE MORTGAGE POSITION IS COLLATERALIZED BY HIGH QUALITY INTERNATIONAL PRIME RESIDENTIAL MORTGAGE LOANS.

CASH FLOWS

FISCAL YEAR 2008 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2007

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $3.8 BILLION DUE TO AN INCREASE IN

CASH RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS DRIVEN BY 18% REVENUE GROWTH, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE $1.4 BILLION (



899 MILLION) PAYMENT OF THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION FINE. CASH USED

FOR FINANCING DECREASED $11.6 BILLION PRIMARILY DUE TO A $15.0 BILLION DECREASE IN COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $3.3 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK. CASH USED FOR INVESTING WAS $4.6 BILLION FOR

FISCAL YEAR 2008 AS COMPARED WITH CASH PROVIDED OF $6.1 BILLION FOR FISCAL YEAR 2007. THIS DECREASE WAS PRIMARILY DUE TO A $6.9 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH PAID FOR ACQUISITION OF COMPANIES, REFLECTING THE PURCHASE OF AQUANTIVE IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF

FISCAL YEAR 2008, A $918 MILLION INCREASE IN PURCHASES OF PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT, AND A $3.1 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH FROM COMBINED INVESTMENT PURCHASES, SALES, AND MATURITIES.

AS A RESULT OF OUR SETTLEMENT RELATED TO THE 2000-2003 EXAMINATION, WE PAID THE IRS APPROXIMATELY $3.1 BILLION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2009.

FISCAL YEAR 2007 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2006

CASH

FLOW FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $3.4 BILLION DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CASH RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS DRIVEN BY 15% REVENUE GROWTH, ALONG WITH A $1.6 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH OUTFLOW FOR OTHER CURRENT ASSETS PRIMARILY REFLECTING CHANGES IN INVENTORY. CASH

USED FOR FINANCING INCREASED $4.0 BILLION. SEVERAL EVENTS OCCURRED DURING FISCAL YEAR 2007 AFFECTING CASH USED FOR FINANCING. WE ISSUED $6.8 BILLION OF COMMON STOCK, INCLUDING $3.3 BILLION RELATED TO 113 MILLION CALL OPTIONS EXERCISED BY

JPMORGAN IN DECEMBER 2006. WE ALSO COMPLETED OUR TENDER OFFER ON AUGUST 17, 2006, WHICH WAS INCLUDED IN THE $27.6 BILLION OF COMMON STOCK REPURCHASES. CASH FROM INVESTING DECREASED $1.9 BILLION DUE TO A $3.5 BILLION DECLINE IN SECURITIES

LENDING ACTIVITY WHERE CASH COLLATERAL IS RECEIVED FROM THE COUNTERPARTY ALONG WITH $1.2 BILLION SPENT ON ACQUISITIONS OF COMPANIES AND ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT. THESE IMPACTS WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A $2.8 BILLION INCREASE IN NET CASH

FROM COMBINED INVESTMENT PURCHASES, SALES, AND MATURITIES.

ON JULY 20, 2006, WE ANNOUNCED THE COMPLETION OF THE REPURCHASE PROGRAM INITIALLY APPROVED BY OUR BOARD

OF DIRECTORS ON JULY 20, 2004 TO BUY BACK UP TO $30.0 BILLION IN MICROSOFT COMMON STOCK. DURING FISCAL YEAR 2006, WE REPURCHASED 754 MILLION SHARES, OR $19.8 BILLION, OF OUR COMMON STOCK UNDER THIS PLAN. ON JULY 20, 2006, WE ANNOUNCED

THAT OUR BOARD OF DIRECTORS AUTHORIZED TWO NEW SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAMS: A $20.0 BILLION TENDER OFFER, WHICH WAS COMPLETED ON AUGUST 17, 2006; AND AUTHORIZATION FOR UP TO AN ADDITIONAL $20.0 BILLION ONGOING SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM WITH AN

EXPIRATION OF JUNE 30, 2011. UNDER THE TENDER OFFER, WE REPURCHASED APPROXIMATELY 155 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK, OR 1.5% OF OUR COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING, FOR APPROXIMATELY $3.8 BILLION AT A PRICE PER SHARE OF $24.75. ON

AUGUST 18, 2006, WE ANNOUNCED THAT THE AUTHORIZATION FOR THE $20.0 BILLION ONGOING SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM HAD BEEN INCREASED BY APPROXIMATELY $16.2 BILLION. AS A RESULT, WE WERE AUTHORIZED TO REPURCHASE ADDITIONAL SHARES IN AN AMOUNT UP TO

$36.2 BILLION THROUGH JUNE 30, 2011. AS OF JUNE 30, 2008, APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION REMAINED OF THE $36.2 BILLION APPROVED REPURCHASE AMOUNT.

WE BELIEVE EXISTING CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, TOGETHER WITH FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS, SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OPERATING REQUIREMENTS, REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, AND PLANNED SHARE

REPURCHASES. OUR PHILOSOPHY REGARDING THE MAINTENANCE OF A BALANCE SHEET WITH A LARGE COMPONENT OF CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AS WELL AS EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS, REFLECTS OUR VIEWS ON POTENTIAL FUTURE CAPITAL REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, CREATION AND EXPANSION OF SALES DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS, INVESTMENTS AND ACQUISITIONS, SHARE DILUTION MANAGEMENT, LEGAL RISKS, AND CHALLENGES TO OUR BUSINESS MODEL. WE REGULARLY ASSESS OUR INVESTMENT MANAGEMENT APPROACH IN

VIEW OF OUR CURRENT AND POTENTIAL FUTURE NEEDS.

OFF-BALANCE SHEET ARRANGEMENTS AND CONTRACTUAL OBLIGATIONS

WE PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS OF VARYING SCOPE AND AMOUNT TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AGAINST CLAIMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT MADE BY THIRD PARTIES ARISING

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

ON

JULY 1, 2007, WE ADOPTED FIN 48 WHICH PROVIDES A FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR A TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. UNDER FIN 48, WE MAY RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN

UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM

SUCH A POSITION SHOULD BE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. FIN 48 ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF

CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. UPON ADOPTION, WE RECOGNIZED A $395 MILLION CHARGE TO OUR BEGINNING RETAINED DEFICIT AS A

CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE. SEE NOTE 11  INCOME TAXES OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART II, ITEM 8).

ON JULY 1, 2007, WE ADOPTED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 06-2 (EITF 06-2),

ACCOUNTING FOR SABBATICAL LEAVE AND OTHER SIMILAR BENEFITS PURSUANT TO FASB STATEMENT NO. 43

. EITF 06-2

REQUIRES COMPANIES TO ACCRUE THE COSTS OF COMPENSATED ABSENCES UNDER A SABBATICAL OR SIMILAR BENEFIT ARRANGEMENT OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. UPON ADOPTION, WE RECOGNIZED A $17 MILLION CHARGE TO OUR BEGINNING RETAINED DEFICIT AS A CUMULATIVE

RECENT ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED

IN MARCH 2008, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 161,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT

DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, AN AMENDMENT OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 133,

WHICH REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE OBJECTIVES OF THE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, THE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR SUCH

INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS NO. 133 AND ITS RELATED INTERPRETATIONS, AND A TABULAR DISCLOSURE OF THE EFFECTS OF SUCH INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED HEDGED ITEMS ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND CASH FLOWS. SFAS NO. 161 IS

EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009. WE ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 161 MAY HAVE ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 141R,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

, WHICH REPLACES SFAS NO. 141. THE STATEMENT RETAINS THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR ACQUISITIONS, BUT REQUIRES

A NUMBER OF CHANGES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE WAY ASSETS AND LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING. IT ALSO CHANGES THE RECOGNITION OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED ARISING FROM CONTINGENCIES, REQUIRES THE CAPITALIZATION OF

IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AT FAIR VALUE, AND REQUIRES THE EXPENSING OF ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS AS INCURRED. SFAS NO. 141R IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2009 AND WILL APPLY PROSPECTIVELY TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

COMPLETED ON OR AFTER THAT DATE.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 160,

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AN AMENDMENT OF ARB NO. 51,

WHICH CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR MINORITY INTERESTS. MINORITY INTERESTS WILL BE RECHARACTERIZED AS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND WILL BE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF EQUITY

SEPARATE FROM THE PARENTS EQUITY, AND PURCHASES OR SALES OF EQUITY INTERESTS THAT DO NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE IN CONTROL WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS EQUITY TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST WILL BE

INCLUDED IN CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ON THE FACE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT AND, UPON A LOSS OF CONTROL, THE INTEREST SOLD, AS WELL AS ANY INTEREST RETAINED, WILL BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH ANY GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. SFAS NO. 160

IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2009 AND WILL APPLY PROSPECTIVELY, EXCEPT FOR THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WILL APPLY RETROSPECTIVELY. WE ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT ADOPTION OF SFAS

NO. 160 MAY HAVE ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 159,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR

FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

. SFAS NO. 159 GIVES US THE IRREVOCABLE OPTION TO CARRY MANY FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUES, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. SFAS NO. 159 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US

BEGINNING JULY 1, 2008. WE DO NOT BELIEVE SFAS NO. 159 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN

SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

, WHICH DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR MEASURING FAIR VALUE IN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE

MEASUREMENTS. THIS STATEMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, BUT PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE BY PROVIDING A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY USED TO CLASSIFY THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED

FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) 157-2,

EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 157,

WHICH DELAYS THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SFAS NO. 157 FOR ALL NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND NONFINANCIAL LIABILITIES, EXCEPT FOR ITEMS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR

DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY). SFAS NO. 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2008; FSP 157-2 DELAYS THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR CERTAIN ITEMS TO JULY 1, 2009. WE DO NOT

BELIEVE SFAS NO. 157 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.

PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENTS APPLICATION OF

ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR US INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL, ACCOUNTING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME

TAXES, ACCOUNTING FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND ACCOUNTING FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES.

WE ACCOUNT FOR THE LICENSING OF SOFTWARE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) 97-2,

SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION

. THE APPLICATION OF SOP 97-2 REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING WHETHER A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT INCLUDES

ELEMENTS OF OUR PRODUCTS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. THESE ELEMENTS INCLUDE FREE POST-DELIVERY TELEPHONE SUPPORT AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS

OF MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER ON A WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE ELEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE CYCLE FOR THE WINDOWS XP AND PREVIOUS PC OPERATING SYSTEMS. FOR WINDOWS VISTA, THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT

UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS AND ACCORDINGLY, NO LICENSE REVENUE IS DEFERRED FOR WINDOWS VISTA SALES. CHANGES TO THE ELEMENTS IN A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, THE ABILITY TO IDENTIFY VSOE FOR THOSE ELEMENTS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS, AND CHANGES

TO A PRODUCTS ESTIMATED LIFE CYCLE COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF EARNED AND UNEARNED REVENUE. JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER FUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO

EXISTING PRODUCTS.

SFAS NO. 115,

ACCOUNTING FOR CERTAIN INVESTMENTS IN DEBT AND EQUITY SECURITIES

, AND STAFF ACCOUNTING

BULLETIN TOPIC 5M,

ACCOUNTING FOR NONCURRENT MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES

, PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON DETERMINING WHEN AN INVESTMENT IS OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. INVESTMENTS ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY QUARTERLY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS.

IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT. WE ALSO CONSIDER

SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS, AND RATING AGENCY ACTIONS. ONCE A

DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IF MARKET, INDUSTRY, AND/OR INVESTEE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.

SFAS NO. 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS

, REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL BE TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT

LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (JULY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW

ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, COMPETITION OR SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT.

APPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE

OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS,

ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, THE USEFUL LIFE OVER WHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE

DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT. WE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE COMBINATION. WE EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF

NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH.

WE ACCOUNT FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS IN

ACCORDANCE WITH APPLICABLE ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, INCLUDING SFAS NO. 2,

ACCOUNTING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

, AND SFAS NO. 86,

ACCOUNTING FOR THE COSTS OF COMPUTER SOFTWARE TO BE SOLD, LEASED, OR OTHERWISE

MARKETED

. SFAS NO. 86 SPECIFIES THAT COSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT SHOULD BE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL

FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED, ALL SOFTWARE COSTS SHOULD BE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE DETERMINED

THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED AFTER ALL HIGH-RISK DEVELOPMENT ISSUES HAVE BEEN RESOLVED THROUGH CODING AND TESTING. GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING.

THE OUTCOMES OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. SFAS NO. 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR

CONTINGENCIES

, REQUIRES THAT AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY SUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM SHOULD BE ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT

OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DISCLOSURE OF A CONTINGENCY IS REQUIRED IF THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS HAS BEEN INCURRED. IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS SHOULD BE ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE

DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, OR OUR CASH FLOWS.

SFAS NO. 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES

, ESTABLISHES FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR THE EFFECT OF INCOME TAXES. THE OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR

REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. ACCRUALS FOR UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS ARE PROVIDED

FOR IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE REQUIREMENTS OF FIN 48. UNDER FIN 48, WE MAY RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES,

BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION SHOULD BE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE

SETTLEMENT. FIN 48 ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, AND

INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY

IMPACT OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR CASH FLOWS.

WE ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS

NO. 123(R),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT

. UNDER THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF THIS STATEMENT, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE

REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. DETERMINING THE FAIR VALUE OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS AT THE GRANT DATE REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING ESTIMATING EXPECTED DIVIDENDS. IN ADDITION, JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED IN ESTIMATING THE AMOUNT OF SHARE-BASED AWARDS THAT ARE

EXPECTED TO BE FORFEITED. IF ACTUAL RESULTS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THESE ESTIMATES, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE AND OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS COULD BE MATERIALLY IMPACTED.

WE ACCOUNT FOR PRODUCT WARRANTIES IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES

. WE PROVIDE FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF

HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FOR HARDWARE WARRANTY, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED PRODUCT FAILURE RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED REPAIR COSTS, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC

PRODUCT FAILURES (IF ANY). THE SPECIFIC HARDWARE WARRANTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS VARY DEPENDING UPON THE PRODUCT SOLD AND COUNTRY IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, BUT GENERALLY INCLUDE PARTS AND LABOR OVER A PERIOD GENERALLY RANGING FROM 90 DAYS TO THREE

YEARS. FOR SOFTWARE WARRANTY, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS TO PROVIDE BUG FIXES, SUCH AS SECURITY PATCHES, OVER THE LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE. WE REGULARLY REEVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF THE RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUST THE

AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY.

ITEM 7A.

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

WE ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE, FIXED-INCOME, EQUITY, AND COMMODITY

PRICE RISKS. A PORTION OF THESE RISKS IS HEDGED, BUT FLUCTUATIONS COULD IMPACT OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, FINANCIAL POSITION, AND CASH FLOWS. WE HEDGE A PORTION OF ANTICIPATED REVENUE AND ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE EXPOSURE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY

FLUCTUATIONS, PRIMARILY WITH OPTION CONTRACTS. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE POSITIONS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND,

AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES AND INTEREST RATE DERIVATIVES ARE SUBJECT PRIMARILY TO INTEREST RATE RISK. THE PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND STRUCTURED TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK. SECURITIES HELD IN OUR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS

PORTFOLIO AND EQUITY DERIVATIVES ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE RISK, AND GENERALLY ARE NOT HEDGED. HOWEVER, WE USE PUT-CALL COLLARS TO HEDGE OUR PRICE RISK ON CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES THAT ARE HELD PRIMARILY FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES. COMMODITY DERIVATIVES

HELD FOR THE PURPOSE OF PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION ARE SUBJECT TO COMMODITY PRICE RISK.

WE USE A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL

TO ESTIMATE AND QUANTIFY OUR MARKET RISKS. VAR IS THE EXPECTED LOSS, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE LEVEL, IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES

IN FAIR VALUE, BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE MODEL USED FOR CURRENCIES, EQUITIES, AND COMMODITIES IS GEOMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION, WHICH ALLOWS INCORPORATION OF OPTIONALITY WITH REGARD TO THESE RISK EXPOSURES. FOR INTEREST

RATE RISK, EXPOSURES SUCH AS KEY RATE DURATIONS AND SPREAD DURATIONS ARE USED IN CALCULATIONS THAT REFLECT THE PRINCIPLE THAT FIXED-INCOME SECURITY PRICES REVERT TO MATURITY VALUE OVER TIME.

VAR IS CALCULATED BY COMPUTING THE EXPOSURES OF EACH HOLDINGS MARKET VALUE TO A RANGE OF OVER 1,000 EQUITY, FIXED-INCOME, FOREIGN EXCHANGE,

AND COMMODITY RISK FACTORS. THE EXPOSURES ARE THEN USED TO COMPUTE THE PARAMETERS OF A DISTRIBUTION OF POTENTIAL CHANGES IN THE TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF ALL HOLDINGS, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT THE WEIGHTED HISTORICAL VOLATILITIES OF THE DIFFERENT RATES AND

PRICES AND THE WEIGHTED HISTORICAL CORRELATIONS AMONG THE DIFFERENT RATES AND PRICES. THE VAR IS THEN CALCULATED AS THE TOTAL LOSS THAT WILL NOT BE EXCEEDED AT THE 97.5 PERCENTILE CONFIDENCE LEVEL OR, ALTERNATIVELY STATED, THE LOSSES COULD EXCEED

THE VAR IN 25 OUT OF 1,000 CASES. SEVERAL RISK FACTORS ARE NOT CAPTURED IN THE MODEL, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, CREDIT RISK, AND LEGAL RISK.

CERTAIN SECURITIES IN OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO ARE HELD FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES. WE HEDGE THE VALUE OF A PORTION OF THESE SECURITIES THROUGH THE USE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS SUCH AS PUT-CALL COLLARS. IN THESE

ARRANGEMENTS, WE HEDGE A SECURITYS EQUITY PRICE RISK BELOW THE PURCHASED PUT STRIKE AND FORGO MOST OR ALL OF THE BENEFITS OF THE SECURITYS APPRECIATION ABOVE THE SOLD CALL STRIKE. WE ALSO HOLD EQUITY SECURITIES FOR GENERAL INVESTMENT

RETURN PURPOSES.

THE VAR AMOUNTS DISCLOSED BELOW ARE USED AS A RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL AND REFLECT AN ESTIMATE OF POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS

IN FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO. LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE OVER THE SPECIFIED HOLDING PERIOD CAN EXCEED THE REPORTED VAR BY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS AND CAN ALSO ACCUMULATE OVER A LONGER TIME HORIZON THAN THE SPECIFIED HOLDING PERIOD USED IN THE VAR ANALYSIS.

VAR AMOUNTS ARE NOT NECESSARILY REFLECTIVE OF POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING LOSSES, INCLUDING DETERMINATIONS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP.

VAR NUMBERS ARE SHOWN SEPARATELY FOR INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY RATE, EQUITY PRICE, AND COMMODITY PRICE RISKS. THESE VAR NUMBERS INCLUDE THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO POSITIONS AND RELATED HEDGES. WE USE

HISTORICAL DATA TO ESTIMATE VAR. GIVEN THE RELIANCE ON HISTORICAL DATA, VAR IS MOST EFFECTIVE IN ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH THERE ARE NO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS. AN INHERENT LIMITATION IN VAR IS THAT THE

DISTRIBUTION OF PAST CHANGES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT PRODUCE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF FUTURE MARKET RISK.

THE FOLLOWING TABLE

SETS FORTH THE ONE-DAY VAR FOR SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF OUR POSITIONS AS OF AND FOR THE YEARS ENDED JUNE 30, 2008 AND 2007.

NOTES TO

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE

WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. EQUITY

INVESTMENTS IN WHICH WE EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE BUT DO NOT CONTROL AND ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD. INVESTMENTS IN WHICH WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE INVESTEE AND

WHICH DO NOT HAVE READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE COST METHOD.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES.

EXAMPLES INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES, PRODUCT WARRANTIES, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, PRODUCT RETURNS, AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FORFEITURE RATES; ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS THE ELEMENTS COMPRISING A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, INCLUDING THE DISTINCTION

BETWEEN UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW PRODUCTS; WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ACHIEVED FOR OUR PRODUCTS; THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS; ESTIMATING

THE FAIR VALUE AND/OR GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR OUR REPORTING UNITS; AND DETERMINING WHEN INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ACTUAL RESULTS AND OUTCOMES MAY DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED IN

FOREIGN CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT THE EXCHANGE RATE ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM THIS PROCESS ARE CHARGED OR

CREDITED TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI).

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE FEE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTIBILITY IS PROBABLE. WE ENTER INTO CERTAIN ARRANGEMENTS WHERE WE

ARE OBLIGATED TO DELIVER MULTIPLE PRODUCTS AND/OR SERVICES (MULTIPLE ELEMENTS). IN THESE ARRANGEMENTS, WE GENERALLY ALLOCATE THE TOTAL REVENUE AMONG THE ELEMENTS BASED ON THE SALES PRICE OF EACH ELEMENT WHEN SOLD SEPARATELY (VENDOR-SPECIFIC

OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE).

REVENUE FOR RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCTS, PRODUCTS LICENSED TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS),

AND PERPETUAL LICENSES FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS UNDER OUR OPEN AND SELECT VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED. A PORTION OF THE REVENUE RELATED TO CERTAIN PRODUCTS, WHICH INCLUDE ALL WINDOWS XP AND PREVIOUS PC

OPERATING SYSTEMS, IS RECORDED AS UNEARNED DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS INCLUDING, IN SOME CASES, FREE POST-DELIVERY TELEPHONE SUPPORT AND THE RIGHT TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS OF MICROSOFT INTERNET EXPLORER ON A

WHEN-AND-IF-AVAILABLE BASIS. THE AMOUNT OF REVENUE ALLOCATED TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS BASED ON THE VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE FOR THOSE ELEMENTS USING THE RESIDUAL METHOD. UNDER THE RESIDUAL METHOD, THE TOTAL FAIR VALUE OF

THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS, AS INDICATED BY VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE, IS RECORDED AS UNEARNED, AND THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TOTAL ARRANGEMENT FEE AND THE AMOUNT RECORDED AS UNEARNED FOR THE UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE

RELATED TO DELIVERED ELEMENTS. UNEARNED REVENUE DUE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE RELATED PRODUCTS LIFE CYCLE. REVENUE RELATED TO WINDOWS VISTA IS NOT SUBJECT TO A SIMILAR DEFERRAL BECAUSE

THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS.

REVENUE FROM MULTI-YEAR LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS,

SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED, GENERALLY BASED ON THE NEGOTIATED HOURLY RATE IN THE CONSULTING ARRANGEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF HOURS WORKED DURING THE PERIOD. CONSULTING REVENUE FOR FIXED-PRICE SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS IS

RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED.

REVENUE GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED NET OF ANY TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND SUBSEQUENTLY

REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.

COSTS RELATED TO INSIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS, INCLUDING BUG FIXES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT, ARE

COST OF

REVENUE

COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS FOR PRODUCTS SOLD AND PROGRAMS LICENSED, OPERATING COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT

SUPPORT SERVICE CENTERS AND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS, COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN INTERNET-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WARRANTY COSTS, INVENTORY WRITE-DOWNS, COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELIVERY OF CONSULTING SERVICES, AND THE

AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT HAVE REACHED TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY.

RESEARCH

AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED

EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND PROGRAMMING COSTS, LOCALIZATION COSTS INCURRED TO TRANSLATE SOFTWARE FOR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, THE AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED

SOFTWARE CODE AND SERVICES CONTENT, AND IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE

COSTS IS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PRODUCTS.

SALES AND MARKETING

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH SALES AND MARKETING

PERSONNEL, AND THE COST OF ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS, TRADESHOWS, SEMINARS, AND OTHER PROGRAMS. ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.2 BILLION, $1.3 BILLION, AND $1.2 BILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2008, 2007, AND 2006,

RESPECTIVELY.

PRODUCT WARRANTY

WE PROVIDE

FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED. FOR HARDWARE WARRANTY, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED PRODUCT FAILURE RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED REPAIR COSTS,

AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES (IF ANY). THE SPECIFIC HARDWARE WARRANTY TERMS AND CONDITIONS VARY DEPENDING UPON THE PRODUCT SOLD AND COUNTRY IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, BUT GENERALLY INCLUDE PARTS AND LABOR OVER A PERIOD GENERALLY RANGING

FROM 90 DAYS TO THREE YEARS. FOR SOFTWARE WARRANTY, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS TO PROVIDE BUG FIXES, SUCH AS SECURITY PATCHES, OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE. WE REGULARLY REEVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF THE RECORDED

WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUST THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

WE ACCOUNT FOR STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION IN ACCORDANCE WITH SFAS NO. 123(R),

SHARE-BASED PAYMENT.

UNDER THE FAIR VALUE RECOGNITION PROVISIONS OF THIS STATEMENT, SHARE-BASED COMPENSATION COST IS MEASURED AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND IS RECOGNIZED AS EXPENSE OVER THE APPLICABLE VESTING PERIOD OF THE STOCK AWARD

(GENERALLY THREE TO FIVE YEARS) USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL INCOME TAXES, PLUS THE PROVISION FOR U.S. TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES NOT DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY INVESTED. CERTAIN

ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE NOT REPORTED IN TAX RETURNS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE SAME YEAR. THE TAX EFFECT OF SUCH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IS REPORTED AS DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INTEREST-EARNING INVESTMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF

THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO BE CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS APPROXIMATES THEIR CARRYING VALUE. IN GENERAL, INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING MATURITIES OF

LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS. INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES BEYOND ONE YEAR MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM BASED ON THEIR HIGHLY LIQUID NATURE AND BECAUSE SUCH MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT THE INVESTMENT OF CASH THAT

IS AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. ALL CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE RECORDED AT MARKET VALUE USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE ARE REFLECTED IN OCI

(EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS).

EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM INCLUDE BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY

INSTRUMENTS. DEBT SECURITIES AND PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE RECORDED AT MARKET USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE ARE REFLECTED IN OCI (EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY

IMPAIRMENTS). ALL OTHER INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING THOSE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, ARE RECORDED AT COST.

WE LEND CERTAIN

FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO ENHANCE INVESTMENT INCOME. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. COLLATERAL AND/OR SECURITY INTEREST RECEIVED IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND

THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH COLLATERAL IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY.

INVESTMENTS ARE

CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF

OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT.

WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS, AND RATING AGENCY

ACTIONS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED.

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, EQUITY PRICE, INTEREST RATE AND CREDIT RISKS, TO ENHANCE RETURNS, AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. OUR OBJECTIVES FOR

HOLDING DERIVATIVES INCLUDE REDUCING, ELIMINATING, AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THESE EXPOSURES AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE

ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON THE INTENDED USE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND THE RESULTING DESIGNATION. FOR A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DESIGNATED AS A FAIR-VALUE HEDGE, THE GAIN OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE

PERIOD OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH THE OFFSETTING LOSS OR GAIN ON THE HEDGED ITEM ATTRIBUTED TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. FOR A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT DESIGNATED AS A CASH-FLOW HEDGE, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE DERIVATIVES GAIN OR LOSS IS INITIALLY

REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED EXPOSURE AFFECTS EARNINGS. THE INEFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAIN OR LOSS IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED EITHER AS FAIR-VALUE OR CASH-FLOW

HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. GAINS AND LOSSES FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES OF DERIVATIVES THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES FOR ACCOUNTING PURPOSES ARE

RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK.

CERTAIN ASSETS, LIABILITIES, AND FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR

FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE POSITIONS. OPTIONS ARE USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INTERNATIONAL REVENUE FOR UP TO THREE YEARS IN THE FUTURE AND ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

(SFAS) NO. 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES

. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. CERTAIN NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES ARE

HEDGED USING FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR-VALUE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS NO. 133. CERTAIN OPTIONS AND FORWARDS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS NO. 133 ARE ALSO USED TO HEDGE THE

IMPACT OF THE VARIABILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND COLLECTIONS DENOMINATED IN CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES AND TO MANAGE OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES.

EQUITIES PRICE RISK.

EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE USE AND DESIGNATE OPTIONS TO HEDGE FAIR VALUES ON CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES. WE

DETERMINE THE SECURITY SELECTED FOR HEDGING BY EVALUATING MARKET CONDITIONS, UP-FRONT COSTS, AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. CERTAIN OPTIONS, FUTURES, AND SWAP CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS NO. 133, ARE ALSO USED TO

MANAGE EQUITY EXPOSURES.

INTEREST RATE RISK.

FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK. THE

FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK. WE USE EXCHANGE-TRADED OPTION AND FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OVER-THE-COUNTER SWAP CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER

SFAS NO. 133, TO HEDGE INTEREST RATE RISK.

OTHER DERIVATIVES.

SWAP CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS NO. 133, ARE USED TO MANAGE EXPOSURES TO CREDIT RISKS, ENHANCE RETURNS, AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. IN ADDITION, WE MAY INVEST IN WARRANTS TO PURCHASE SECURITIES OF OTHER COMPANIES AS A STRATEGIC

INVESTMENT. WARRANTS THAT CAN BE NET SHARE SETTLED ARE DEEMED DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS ARE ALSO CONSIDERED

DERIVATIVES IN CASES WHERE PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE ASSETS IS NOT TAKEN AT THE EARLIEST AVAILABLE DELIVERY DATE. ALL DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS ARE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN VALUE RECOGNIZED IN

EARNINGS DURING THE PERIOD OF CHANGE.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS REFLECTS OUR BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE. WE DETERMINE THE ALLOWANCE BASED ON KNOWN TROUBLED ACCOUNTS, HISTORICAL

EXPERIENCE, AND OTHER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. ACTIVITY IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WAS AS FOLLOWS.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE

AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR ESTIMATED PERIOD OF BENEFIT, RANGING FROM ONE TO TEN YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS PERIODICALLY AND TAKE INTO ACCOUNT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WARRANT REVISED

ESTIMATES OF USEFUL LIVES OR THAT INDICATE THAT IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. ALL OF OUR INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION. NO MATERIAL IMPAIRMENTS OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS HAVE BEEN IDENTIFIED DURING ANY OF THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

RECENTLY ISSUED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

RECENTLY ADOPTED

ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS

ON JULY 1, 2007, WE ADOPTED THE PROVISIONS OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD (FASB)

INTERPRETATION NO. 48 (FIN 48),

ACCOUNTING FOR UNCERTAINTY IN INCOME TAXES  AN INTERPRETATION OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 109,

WHICH PROVIDES A FINANCIAL STATEMENT RECOGNITION THRESHOLD AND MEASUREMENT ATTRIBUTE FOR A

TAX POSITION TAKEN OR EXPECTED TO BE TAKEN IN A TAX RETURN. UNDER FIN 48, WE MAY RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING

AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION SHOULD BE MEASURED BASED ON THE LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON

ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. FIN 48 ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS,

AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. UPON ADOPTION, WE RECOGNIZED A $395 MILLION CHARGE TO OUR BEGINNING RETAINED DEFICIT AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE. SEE NOTE 11  INCOME TAXES.

ON JULY 1, 2007, WE ADOPTED EMERGING ISSUES TASK FORCE ISSUE NO. 06-2 (EITF 06-2),

ACCOUNTING FOR SABBATICAL LEAVE AND

OTHER SIMILAR BENEFITS PURSUANT TO FASB STATEMENT NO. 43

. EITF 06-2 REQUIRES COMPANIES TO ACCRUE THE COSTS OF COMPENSATED ABSENCES UNDER A SABBATICAL OR SIMILAR BENEFIT ARRANGEMENT OVER THE REQUISITE SERVICE PERIOD. UPON ADOPTION, WE

RECOGNIZED A $17 MILLION CHARGE TO OUR BEGINNING RETAINED DEFICIT AS A CUMULATIVE EFFECT OF A CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLE.

RECENT ACCOUNTING

PRONOUNCEMENTS NOT YET ADOPTED

IN MARCH 2008, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 161,

DISCLOSURES ABOUT DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING

ACTIVITIES, AN AMENDMENT OF FAS 133

, WHICH REQUIRES ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES ABOUT THE OBJECTIVES OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES, THE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR THOSE INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS NO. 133 AND ITS RELATED

INTERPRETATIONS, AND A TABULAR DISCLOSURE OF THE EFFECTS OF THOSE INSTRUMENTS AND RELATED HEDGED ITEMS ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE, AND CASH FLOWS. SFAS NO. 161 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JANUARY 1, 2009. WE ARE

CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 161 MAY HAVE ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN DECEMBER 2007,

THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 141R,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

, WHICH REPLACES SFAS NO 141. THE STATEMENT RETAINS THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING FOR ACQUISITIONS, BUT REQUIRES A NUMBER OF CHANGES, INCLUDING CHANGES IN THE WAY ASSETS AND

LIABILITIES ARE RECOGNIZED IN THE PURCHASE ACCOUNTING. IT ALSO CHANGES THE RECOGNITION OF ASSETS ACQUIRED AND LIABILITIES ASSUMED ARISING FROM CONTINGENCIES, REQUIRES THE CAPITALIZATION OF IN-PROCESS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT AT FAIR VALUE, AND

REQUIRES THE EXPENSING OF ACQUISITION-RELATED COSTS AS INCURRED. SFAS NO. 141R IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2009 AND WILL APPLY PROSPECTIVELY TO BUSINESS COMBINATIONS COMPLETED ON OR AFTER THAT DATE.

IN DECEMBER 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 160,

NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS IN CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AN AMENDMENT OF ARB 51,

WHICH CHANGES THE ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING FOR MINORITY INTERESTS. MINORITY INTERESTS WILL BE

RECHARACTERIZED AS NONCONTROLLING INTERESTS AND WILL BE REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF EQUITY SEPARATE FROM THE PARENTS EQUITY, AND PURCHASES OR SALES OF EQUITY INTERESTS THAT DO NOT RESULT IN A CHANGE IN CONTROL WILL BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS EQUITY

TRANSACTIONS. IN ADDITION, NET INCOME ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE NONCONTROLLING INTEREST WILL BE INCLUDED IN CONSOLIDATED NET INCOME ON THE FACE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT AND, UPON A LOSS OF CONTROL, THE INTEREST SOLD, AS WELL AS ANY INTEREST RETAINED, WILL

BE RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE WITH ANY GAIN OR LOSS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. SFAS NO. 160 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2009 AND WILL APPLY PROSPECTIVELY, EXCEPT FOR THE PRESENTATION AND DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS, WHICH WILL APPLY

RETROSPECTIVELY. WE ARE CURRENTLY ASSESSING THE POTENTIAL IMPACT THAT ADOPTION OF SFAS NO. 160 MAY HAVE ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 159,

THE FAIR VALUE OPTION FOR FINANCIAL ASSETS AND FINANCIAL LIABILITIES

. SFAS NO. 159 GIVES US THE IRREVOCABLE OPTION TO CARRY MANY FINANCIAL ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR

VALUE, WITH CHANGES IN FAIR VALUE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. SFAS NO. 159 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2008. WE DO NOT BELIEVE SFAS NO. 159 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN SEPTEMBER 2006, THE FASB ISSUED SFAS NO. 157,

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

, WHICH DEFINES FAIR VALUE, ESTABLISHES A FRAMEWORK FOR

MEASURING FAIR VALUE IN GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND EXPANDS DISCLOSURES ABOUT FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS. THIS STATEMENT DOES NOT REQUIRE ANY NEW FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS, BUT PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON HOW TO MEASURE FAIR VALUE BY PROVIDING

A FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY USED TO CLASSIFY THE SOURCE OF THE INFORMATION. IN FEBRUARY 2008, THE FASB ISSUED FASB STAFF POSITION (FSP) 157-2,

EFFECTIVE DATE OF FASB STATEMENT NO. 157,

WHICH DELAYS THE EFFECTIVE DATE OF SFAS

NO. 157 FOR ALL NONFINANCIAL ASSETS AND NONFINANCIAL LIABILITIES, EXCEPT FOR ITEMS THAT ARE RECOGNIZED OR DISCLOSED AT FAIR VALUE IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS ON A RECURRING BASIS (AT LEAST ANNUALLY). SFAS NO. 157 IS EFFECTIVE FOR US

BEGINNING JULY 1, 2008; FSP 157-2 DELAYS THE EFFECTIVE DATE FOR CERTAIN ITEMS TO JULY 1, 2009. WE DO NOT BELIEVE SFAS NO. 157 WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOTE 2    EARNINGS PER SHARE

FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2007, FOUR

WE ESTIMATE THAT $111 MILLION OF NET DERIVATIVE GAINS INCLUDED IN

OCI WILL BE RECLASSIFIED INTO EARNINGS WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. NO SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF GAINS OR LOSSES WERE RECLASSIFIED FROM OCI INTO EARNINGS AS A RESULT OF FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS THAT FAILED TO OCCUR FOR FISCAL YEARS 2008, 2007, AND 2006.

2000-2003 EXAMINATION. AS A RESULT, WE REDUCED OUR UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS BY $4.8 BILLION AND RECOGNIZED A TAX PROVISION REDUCTION OF $1.2 BILLION. WE ARE UNDER AUDIT BY THE IRS FOR THE TAX YEARS 2004-2006. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS

REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AS WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE EXAMINATION WILL BE CONCLUDED WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. AS A RESULT OF OUR SETTLEMENT

RELATED TO THE 2000-2003 EXAMINATION, WE PAID THE IRS APPROXIMATELY $3.1 BILLION DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2009.

WE ARE

SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, NONE OF WHICH ARE INDIVIDUALLY MATERIAL TO OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, CASH FLOWS, OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

GOVERNMENT COMPETITION LAW MATTERS.

IN MARCH 2004, THE EUROPEAN

COMMISSION ISSUED A COMPETITION LAW DECISION THAT, AMONG OTHER THINGS, ORDERED US TO LICENSE CERTAIN WINDOWS SERVER PROTOCOL TECHNOLOGY TO OUR COMPETITORS. IN MARCH 2007, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION ISSUED A STATEMENT OF OBJECTIONS CLAIMING THAT

THE PRICING TERMS WE PROPOSED FOR LICENSING THE TECHNOLOGY AS REQUIRED BY THE MARCH 2004 DECISION WERE NOT REASONABLE. FOLLOWING ADDITIONAL STEPS WE TOOK TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS, THE COMMISSION ANNOUNCED ON OCTOBER 22, 2007

THAT WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE MARCH 2004 DECISION AND THAT NO FURTHER PENALTY SHOULD ACCRUE AFTER THAT DATE. ON FEBRUARY 27, 2008, THE COMMISSION ISSUED A FINE OF $1.4 BILLION (



899 MILLION) RELATING TO THE PERIOD PRIOR TO OCTOBER 22, 2007. IN JANUARY 2008, THE COMMISSION ANNOUNCED THAT IT WAS OPENING TWO NEW COMPETITION LAW INVESTIGATIONS. THESE INVESTIGATIONS RELATE PRIMARILY TO

INTEROPERABILITY WITH RESPECT TO OUR MICROSOFT OFFICE FAMILY OF PRODUCTS AND THE INCLUSION OF VARIOUS CAPABILITIES IN OUR WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE, INCLUDING WEB BROWSING SOFTWARE. THESE INVESTIGATIONS WERE PRECIPITATED BY COMPLAINTS FILED

WITH THE COMMISSION BY A TRADE ASSOCIATION OF MICROSOFTS COMPETITORS AND A FIRM THAT OFFERS WEB BROWSING SOFTWARE. IN MAY 2008, WE FILED AN APPLICATION WITH THE EUROPEAN COURT OF FIRST INSTANCE TO ANNUL THE FEBRUARY 2008 FINE. WE PAID THE

$1.4 BILLION (



899 MILLION) FINE IN JUNE 2008.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A CONSENT DECREE AND FINAL JUDGMENT THAT RESOLVED LAWSUITS BROUGHT BY THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE, 18 STATES, AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA IN TWO SEPARATE ACTIONS. THE CONSENT DECREE IMPOSED VARIOUS CONSTRAINTS ON OUR

WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM BUSINESSES. PORTIONS OF THE CONSENT DECREE WERE SCHEDULED TO EXPIRE ON JANUARY 31, 2008; WE VOLUNTARILY AGREED TO EXTEND OTHER ELEMENTS OF THE CONSENT DECREE TO NOVEMBER 2009. IN OCTOBER 2007, SOME STATES FILED A

MOTION WITH THE U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA SEEKING TO HAVE MOST OF THE REMAINING PROVISIONS OF THE FINAL JUDGMENT IN THE ACTION TO WHICH THEY ARE PARTY EXTENDED FOR FIVE YEARS. THE U.S. DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE AND OTHER STATES

ADVISED THE COURT THAT THEY WOULD NOT SEEK ANY EXTENSION OF THE FINAL JUDGMENTS TO WHICH THEY ARE PARTY. IN JANUARY 2008, THE COURT ISSUED A DECISION GRANTING THE STATES MOTION TO EXTEND THESE ADDITIONAL PROVISIONS OF THE CONSENT DECREE UNTIL

NOVEMBER 2009.

IN OTHER ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, VARIOUS FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS AND SEVERAL STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE REQUESTED

INFORMATION FROM US CONCERNING COMPETITION, PRIVACY, AND SECURITY ISSUES.

ANTITRUST, UNFAIR COMPETITION, AND OVERCHARGE CLASS

ACTIONS.

A LARGE NUMBER OF ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN FILED AGAINST US IN VARIOUS STATE, FEDERAL, AND CANADIAN COURTS ON BEHALF OF VARIOUS CLASSES OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT PURCHASERS OF

OUR PC OPERATING SYSTEM AND CERTAIN OTHER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. WE OBTAINED DISMISSALS OF DAMAGES CLAIMS OF INDIRECT PURCHASERS UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND IN 15 STATES. COURTS REFUSED TO CERTIFY CLASSES IN TWO ADDITIONAL STATES. WE HAVE REACHED AGREEMENTS

TO SETTLE ALL CLAIMS THAT HAVE BEEN MADE TO DATE IN 19 STATES AND THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.

UNDER THE SETTLEMENTS, GENERALLY CLASS

MEMBERS CAN OBTAIN VOUCHERS THAT ENTITLE THEM TO BE REIMBURSED FOR PURCHASES OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PLATFORM-NEUTRAL COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. THE TOTAL VALUE OF VOUCHERS THAT WE MAY ISSUE VARIES BY STATE. WE WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN

SCHOOLS A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE VOUCHERS THAT ARE NOT ISSUED OR CLAIMED (ONE-HALF TO TWO-THIRDS DEPENDING ON THE STATE). THE TOTAL VALUE OF VOUCHERS WE ULTIMATELY ISSUE WILL DEPEND ON THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBERS WHO MAKE CLAIMS AND ARE ISSUED

VOUCHERS. THE MAXIMUM VALUE OF VOUCHERS TO BE ISSUED IS APPROXIMATELY $2.7 BILLION. THE ACTUAL COSTS OF THESE SETTLEMENTS WILL BE LESS THAN THAT MAXIMUM AMOUNT, DEPENDING ON THE NUMBER OF CLASS MEMBERS AND SCHOOLS THAT ARE ISSUED AND REDEEM

VOUCHERS.

THE SETTLEMENTS IN ALL STATES HAVE RECEIVED FINAL COURT APPROVAL. CASES IN ARIZONA, MISSISSIPPI AND CANADA HAVE NOT BEEN

SETTLED. WE ESTIMATE THE TOTAL COST TO RESOLVE ALL OF THESE CASES WILL RANGE BETWEEN $1.7 BILLION AND $1.9 BILLION. THE ACTUAL COST DEPENDS ON FACTORS SUCH AS THE QUANTITY AND MIX OF PRODUCTS FOR WHICH CLAIMS WILL BE MADE, THE NUMBER OF ELIGIBLE

CLASS MEMBERS WHO ULTIMATELY USE THE VOUCHERS, THE NATURE OF HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE THAT IS ACQUIRED USING THE VOUCHERS, AND THE COST OF ADMINISTERING THE CLAIMS. AT JUNE 30, 2008, WE HAVE RECORDED A LIABILITY RELATED TO THESE CLAIMS OF

APPROXIMATELY $900 MILLION, WHICH REFLECTS OUR ESTIMATED EXPOSURE OF $1.7 BILLION LESS PAYMENTS MADE TO DATE OF APPROXIMATELY $800 MILLION, MOSTLY FOR ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES, VOUCHERS, AND LEGAL FEES.

OTHER ANTITRUST LITIGATION AND CLAIMS.

IN NOVEMBER 2004, NOVELL, INC. FILED A COMPLAINT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN UTAH, NOW

TRANSFERRED WITH OTHER CASES TO MARYLAND, ASSERTING ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLAIMS AGAINST US RELATED TO NOVELLS OWNERSHIP OF WORDPERFECT AND OTHER PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN JUNE 1994 AND MARCH 1996. IN

JUNE 2005, THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED OUR MOTION TO DISMISS FOUR OF SIX CLAIMS OF THE COMPLAINT. BOTH PARTIES APPEALED, AND IN OCTOBER 2007, THE COURT OF APPEALS AFFIRMED THE DECISION OF THE TRIAL COURT, REMANDING THE CASE TO THAT COURT FOR

FURTHER PROCEEDINGS.

PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS.

WE ARE VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING MORE THAN 45 PATENT INFRINGEMENT CASES. MICROSOFT AND ALCATEL-LUCENT ARE PARTIES TO A NUMBER OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS RELATING TO CERTAIN PATENTS

OF EACH OF THE COMPANIES. SOME OF THESE ACTIONS BEGAN BEFORE THE MERGER OF ALCATEL AND LUCENT IN 2006. FOR SIMPLICITY, WE REFER TO THE POST-MERGER ENTITY AS ALCATEL-LUCENT THROUGHOUT THIS DISCUSSION.



IN 2003, WE FILED AN ACTION IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN CALIFORNIA SEEKING A DECLARATORY JUDGMENT THAT WE DO NOT INFRINGE CERTAIN ALCATEL-LUCENT PATENTS. ALCATEL-LUCENT HAS

ASSERTED CLAIMS UNDER THESE PATENTS AGAINST COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS THAT SELL COMPUTERS WITH OUR OPERATING SYSTEM AND APPLICATION SOFTWARE PRE-INSTALLED. IN FEBRUARY 2007, THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT IN ALCATEL-LUCENTS FAVOR IN THE FIRST OF A

SERIES OF PATENT TRIALS, AND AWARDED $1.5 BILLION IN DAMAGES. IN AUGUST 2007, ON OUR MOTIONS FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW, THE TRIAL COURT OVERTURNED THE JURY VERDICT AND ENTERED ORDERS DISMISSING PLAINTIFFS CLAIMS ON MULTIPLE GROUNDS.

ALCATEL-LUCENT APPEALED. THE TRIAL COURT PREVIOUSLY DISMISSED ALCATEL-LUCENTS CLAIMS WITH RESPECT TO A SECOND GROUP OF PATENTS AND TWO PATENTS IN A THIRD GROUPING. IN APRIL 2008, A JURY RETURNED A VERDICT IN ALCATEL-LUCENTS FAVOR IN A

TRIAL ON A CONSOLIDATED GROUP OF VIDEO AND USER INTERFACE PATENTS. THE JURY CONCLUDED THAT MICROSOFT HAD INFRINGED TWO PATENTS AND AWARDED $367 MILLION IN DAMAGES. ON JUNE 19, 2008, THE TRIAL JUDGE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF DAMAGES TO $512

MILLION, WHICH INCLUDES THE $367 MILLION OF DAMAGES AND $145 MILLION OF INTEREST. MICROSOFT WILL APPEAL THE VERDICT.



IN MARCH 2006, ALCATEL-LUCENT FILED A LAWSUIT AGAINST US IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN CALIFORNIA, CLAIMING WINDOWS VISTA, WINDOWS MEDIA PLAYER, AND THE XBOX 360 INFRINGE ONE

OF ITS PATENTS. IN RESPONSE, WE ASSERTED COUNTERCLAIMS THAT ALCATEL-LUCENT INFRINGES 10 MICROSOFT PATENTS BY ITS SALE OF VARIOUS PRODUCTS. THE CASE WENT TO TRIAL IN APRIL 2008 ON ALCATEL-LUCENTS VIDEO PATENT AND FOUR MICROSOFT COUNTERCLAIM

PATENTS. THE JURY RETURNED A VERDICT IN MICROSOFTS FAVOR ON JUNE 4, 2008, FINDING NO INFRINGEMENT OF ALCATEL-LUCENTS PATENT. THE JURY ALSO FOUND NO INFRINGEMENT OF MICROSOFTS COUNTERCLAIM PATENTS.



IN NOVEMBER 2006, ALCATEL-LUCENT FILED TWO PATENT INFRINGEMENT CASES AGAINST US IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN TEXAS, ASSERTING MEDIAROOM AND VARIOUS NETWORKING

FUNCTIONALITIES VIOLATE SEVEN OF ITS PATENTS. IN APRIL 2007, WE ASSERTED INFRINGEMENT COUNTERCLAIMS BASED ON FOUR OF OUR PATENTS RELATING TO FUNCTIONALITY SIMILAR TO THAT ACCUSED BY ALCATEL-LUCENT. THE TRIAL ON ALL OF THE PATENTS IS SET FOR

JANUARY 2009.



IN FEBRUARY 2007, WE FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST ALCATEL-LUCENT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION CLAIMING ALCATEL-LUCENT IS INFRINGING FOUR MICROSOFT PATENTS RELATED

TO OUR UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS TECHNOLOGY AND SEEKING TO PREVENT THE IMPORT INTO THE U.S. OF CERTAIN ALCATEL-LUCENT UNIFIED COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS. TRIAL OF THIS MATTER TOOK PLACE IN OCTOBER 2007. THE ADMINISTRATIVE LAW JUDGE RULED THAT

ALCATEL-LUCENT INFRINGED ONE OF THE FOUR ASSERTED PATENTS. THE COMMISSION REVERSED THAT DECISION IN MAY 2008. WE ARE APPEALING THAT RULING TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT.



IN APRIL 2007, THE MULTIMEDIA PATENT TRUST FILED A COMPLAINT AGAINST MICROSOFT, DELL, AND GATEWAY IN SAN DIEGO, CALIFORNIA ACCUSING THE PARTIES OF INFRINGING THREE

VIDEO-RELATED PATENTS THAT ORIGINALLY BELONGED TO ALCATEL-LUCENT. ALCATEL-LUCENT CREATED THE MULTIMEDIA PATENT TRUST PRIOR TO THE COMPANIES MERGER AND TRANSFERRED THE PATENTS AT ISSUE TO THE TRUST. IN JUNE 2008, THE PLAINTIFF DISMISSED ONE OF

THE PATENT CLAIMS.

THE ACTUAL COSTS TO RESOLVE THESE CASES WILL DEPEND UPON MANY FACTORS SUCH AS THE OUTCOME OF

POST-TRIAL MOTIONS, ANY APPEALS, AND THE RESULTS OF THE REMAINING TRIALS. ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN SOME OR ALL OF THE MATTERS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF AGAINST US THAT WOULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

DISTRIBUTION OF OUR OPERATING SYSTEM OR APPLICATION PRODUCTS. WE MAY ENTER INTO MATERIAL SETTLEMENTS BECAUSE OF THESE RISKS.

OTHER.

WE ARE ALSO SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF OTHER CLAIMS AND SUITS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT RESOLVING CLAIMS AGAINST US,

INDIVIDUALLY OR IN AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR FINANCIAL POSITION, OUR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, OR OUR CASH FLOWS, THESE MATTERS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE

IN THE FUTURE.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2008, WE HAD ACCRUED AGGREGATE LIABILITIES OF APPROXIMATELY $600 MILLION IN OTHER CURRENT

LIABILITIES AND APPROXIMATELY $500 MILLION IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES FOR ALL OF THE CONTINGENT MATTERS DESCRIBED IN THIS NOTE. WHILE WE INTEND TO VIGOROUSLY DEFEND THESE MATTERS, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF ADVERSE OUTCOMES THAT WE

STOCK AWARDS (SAS) ARE GRANTS THAT ENTITLE THE HOLDER TO SHARES OF COMMON STOCK AS THE AWARD VESTS. OUR SAS GENERALLY VEST OVER A FIVE-YEAR PERIOD.

SHARED PERFORMANCE STOCK AWARDS (SPSAS) ARE A FORM OF SA IN WHICH THE NUMBER OF SHARES ULTIMATELY RECEIVED DEPENDS ON OUR

BUSINESS PERFORMANCE AGAINST SPECIFIED PERFORMANCE TARGETS. THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD FOR SPSAS ISSUED IN FISCAL YEARS 2004, 2005, AND 2006 WAS JULY 1, 2003 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2006 (JANUARY 1, 2004 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2006 FOR CERTAIN

EXECUTIVE OFFICERS). FOLLOWING THE END OF THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DETERMINED THAT THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF SAS TO BE ISSUED WAS 37 MILLION, BASED ON THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE AGAINST METRICS

ESTABLISHED FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. ONE-THIRD OF THE AWARDS VESTED IN EACH OF THE FISCAL YEARS 2007 AND 2008. AN ADDITIONAL ONE-THIRD OF THE AWARDS WILL VEST IN FISCAL YEAR 2009. BECAUSE THE SPSAS COVERED A THREE-YEAR PERIOD, SPSAS ISSUED IN

FISCAL YEAR 2006 WERE GIVEN ONLY TO NEWLY HIRED AND PROMOTED EMPLOYEES ELIGIBLE TO RECEIVE SPSAS.

THE COMPANY GRANTED SPSAS FOR

FISCAL YEARS 2007 AND 2008 WITH PERFORMANCE PERIODS OF JULY 1, 2006 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2007 AND JULY 1, 2007 THROUGH JUNE 30, 2008, RESPECTIVELY. AT THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR PERFORMANCE PERIOD, THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF STOCK

SUBJECT TO THE AWARD IS DETERMINED BY MULTIPLYING THE TARGET AWARD BY A PERCENTAGE RANGING FROM 0% TO 150%. THE PERCENTAGE IS BASED ON PERFORMANCE METRICS FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD, AS DETERMINED BY THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF

DIRECTORS IN ITS SOLE DISCRETION. AN ADDITIONAL NUMBER OF SHARES, APPROXIMATELY 15% OF THE TOTAL TARGET SPSAS, ARE AVAILABLE AS ADDITIONAL AWARDS TO PARTICIPANTS BASED ON INDIVIDUAL PERFORMANCE. ONE-QUARTER OF THE SHARES OF STOCK SUBJECT TO EACH

AWARD VEST FOLLOWING THE END OF THE

PERFORMANCE PERIOD, AND AN ADDITIONAL ONE-QUARTER OF THE SHARES VEST OVER EACH OF THE FOLLOWING THREE YEARS. FOLLOWING THE END OF THE FISCAL YEAR 2007 PERFORMANCE

PERIOD, THE COMPENSATION COMMITTEE OF THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS DETERMINED THAT THE NUMBER OF SHARES OF SAS TO BE ISSUED WAS 11 MILLION, BASED ON THE ACTUAL PERFORMANCE AGAINST METRICS ESTABLISHED FOR THE PERFORMANCE PERIOD. THE NUMBER OF SHARES

OF SAS TO BE ISSUED FOR THE FISCAL YEAR 2008 PERFORMANCE PERIOD WILL BE DETERMINED IN THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2009.

WE

MEASURE THE FAIR VALUE OF SAS AND SPSAS BASED UPON THE MARKET PRICE OF THE UNDERLYING COMMON STOCK AS OF THE DATE OF GRANT, REDUCED BY THE PRESENT VALUE OF ESTIMATED FUTURE DIVIDENDS. SAS AND SPSAS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THEIR APPLICABLE VESTING PERIOD

(GENERALLY THREE TO FIVE YEARS) USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH AWARD GRANT IS ESTIMATED ON THE DATE OF GRANT USING THE FOLLOWING ASSUMPTIONS.

IS EVALUATED REGULARLY BY THE CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER, OR DECISION MAKING GROUP, IN DECIDING HOW TO ALLOCATE RESOURCES AND IN ASSESSING PERFORMANCE. OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER IS OUR CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER. OUR FIVE SEGMENTS ARE

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING FOR THE COMPANY. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED

IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES MAINTAINING RECORDS THAT IN REASONABLE DETAIL ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT OUR TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY FOR PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF COMPANY ASSETS ARE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZATION; AND PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT UNAUTHORIZED

ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF COMPANY ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS NOT

INTENDED TO PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT A MISSTATEMENT OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED.

MANAGEMENT

CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY

COMMISSION. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF JUNE 30, 2008. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND

STOCKHOLDERS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION.

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE

COMPANY) AS OF JUNE 30, 2008, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT

WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS,

TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE

BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION

OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING

THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE

POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT (1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT

TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS

OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF

COLLUSION OR IMPROPER MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER

FINANCIAL REPORTING TO FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2008,

BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30,

2008 OF THE COMPANY AND OUR REPORT DATED JULY 31, 2008 EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND INCLUDED AN EXPLANATORY PARAGRAPH REGARDING THE COMPANYS ADOPTION OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS BOARD
