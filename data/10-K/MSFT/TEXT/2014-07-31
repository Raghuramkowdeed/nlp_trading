ITEM 1

ON APRIL 25, 2014, WE COMPLETED THE TRANSACTION TO ACQUIRE SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF NOKIA

CORPORATIONS (NOKIA) DEVICES AND SERVICES BUSINESS (NDS). WE REPORT THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF NDS IN OUR NEW PHONE HARDWARE SEGMENT. PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION OF NDS, FINANCIAL RESULTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR JOINT

STRATEGIC INITIATIVES WITH NOKIA WERE REFLECTED IN OUR D&C LICENSING SEGMENT. THE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH NOKIA RELATED TO THOSE INITIATIVES TERMINATED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACQUISITION. WITH THE CREATION OF THE NEW PHONE HARDWARE

SEGMENT, THE D&C HARDWARE SEGMENT WAS RENAMED COMPUTING AND GAMING HARDWARE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2014.

OUR SEGMENTS

PROVIDE MANAGEMENT WITH A COMPREHENSIVE FINANCIAL VIEW OF OUR KEY BUSINESSES. THE SEGMENTS ENABLE THE ALIGNMENT OF STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES ACROSS THE DEVELOPMENT, SALES, MARKETING, AND SERVICES ORGANIZATIONS, AND THEY PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR

TIMELY AND RATIONAL ALLOCATION OF DEVELOPMENT, SALES, MARKETING, AND SERVICES RESOURCES WITHIN BUSINESSES. ADDITIONAL INFORMATION ON OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS AND GEOGRAPHIC AND PRODUCT INFORMATION IS CONTAINED IN NOTE 21  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND

GEOGRAPHIC DATA OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

DEVICES AND CONSUMER

OUR D&C SEGMENTS DEVELOP, MANUFACTURE, MARKET, AND SUPPORT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DESIGNED TO INCREASE PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY, HELP PEOPLE

SIMPLIFY TASKS AND MAKE MORE INFORMED DECISIONS ONLINE, ENTERTAIN AND CONNECT PEOPLE, AND HELP ADVERTISERS CONNECT WITH AUDIENCES. OUR D&C SEGMENTS ARE MADE UP OF D&C LICENSING, COMPUTING AND GAMING HARDWARE, PHONE HARDWARE, AND D&C

OTHER.

D&C LICENSING

THE

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE D&C LICENSING SEGMENT ARE: WINDOWS, INCLUDING ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURER (OEM) LICENSING (WINDOWS OEM) AND OTHER NON-VOLUME LICENSING AND ACADEMIC VOLUME LICENSING OF

THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM AND RELATED SOFTWARE; NON-VOLUME LICENSING OF MICROSOFT OFFICE, COMPRISING THE CORE OFFICE PRODUCT SET, FOR CONSUMERS (OFFICE CONSUMER); WINDOWS PHONE OPERATING SYSTEM, INCLUDING RELATED PATENT LICENSING; AND

CERTAIN OTHER PATENT LICENSING REVENUE.

THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO EMPOWER INDIVIDUALS, COMPANIES, AND ORGANIZATIONS

TO SIMPLIFY EVERYDAY TASKS THROUGH SEAMLESS OPERATIONS ACROSS THE USERS HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE.

WINDOWS REVENUE GROWTH IS IMPACTED

SIGNIFICANTLY BY THE NUMBER OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM LICENSES PURCHASED BY OEMS, WHICH THEY PRE-INSTALL ON THE DEVICES THEY SELL. IN ADDITION TO COMPUTING DEVICE MARKET VOLUME, WINDOWS REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY.



THE MIX OF COMPUTING DEVICES BASED ON FORM FACTOR AND SCREEN SIZE;



DIFFERENCES IN DEVICE MARKET DEMAND BETWEEN DEVELOPED MARKETS AND EMERGING MARKETS;



ATTACHMENT OF WINDOWS TO DEVICES SHIPPED;



CUSTOMER MIX BETWEEN CONSUMER, SMALL AND MEDIUM SIZED BUSINESSES, AND LARGE ENTERPRISES;



CHANGES IN INVENTORY LEVELS IN THE OEM CHANNEL;



PRICING CHANGES AND PROMOTIONS, PRICING VARIATION THAT OCCURS WHEN THE MIX OF DEVICES MANUFACTURED SHIFTS FROM LOCAL AND REGIONAL SYSTEM BUILDERS TO LARGE,

MULTINATIONAL OEMS, AND DIFFERENT PRICING OF WINDOWS VERSIONS LICENSED;



PIRACY; AND



SALES OF PACKAGED SOFTWARE.

THE VERSIONS OF OFFICE INCLUDED IN OUR D&C LICENSING SEGMENT ARE DESIGNED TO INCREASE PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY THROUGH A RANGE OF PROGRAMS,

SERVICES, AND SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS. GROWTH DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ADD VALUE TO THE CORE PRODUCT SET AND TO CONTINUE TO EXPAND OUR PRODUCT OFFERINGS IN OTHER AREAS SUCH AS CONTENT MANAGEMENT AND COLLABORATION. OFFICE CONSUMER REVENUE IS IMPACTED BY

SALES TO CUSTOMERS THAT BUY OFFICE WITH THEIR NEW DEVICES AND BY PRODUCT LAUNCHES, AS WELL AS THE TRANSITION TO OFFICE 365 CONSUMER, OUR SUBSCRIPTION-BASED CLOUD SERVICE THAT PROVIDES ACCESS TO OFFICE PLUS OTHER PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES. OFFICE 365

CONSUMER REVENUE IS INCLUDED IN OUR D&C OTHER SEGMENT.

THE WINDOWS PHONE OPERATING SYSTEM IS DESIGNED TO BRING USERS CLOSER TO THE PEOPLE, APPLICATIONS,

AND CONTENT THEY NEED. AS NOTED ABOVE, PRIOR TO OUR ACQUISITION OF NDS, MICROSOFT AND NOKIA JOINTLY CREATED NEW MOBILE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND EXTENDED ESTABLISHED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES TO NEW MARKETS THROUGH A STRATEGIC ALLIANCE. WINDOWS PHONE

REVENUE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WAS REFLECTED IN D&C LICENSING. WINDOWS PHONE REVENUE ALSO INCLUDES REVENUE FROM LICENSING MOBILE-RELATED PATENTS.

COMPETITION

THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM FACES COMPETITION FROM VARIOUS SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND

FROM ALTERNATIVE PLATFORMS AND DEVICES, MAINLY FROM APPLE AND GOOGLE. WE BELIEVE WINDOWS COMPETES EFFECTIVELY BY GIVING CUSTOMERS CHOICE, VALUE, FLEXIBILITY, SECURITY, AN EASY-TO-USE INTERFACE, COMPATIBILITY WITH A BROAD RANGE OF HARDWARE AND

SOFTWARE APPLICATIONS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT ENABLE PRODUCTIVITY, AND THE LARGEST SUPPORT NETWORK FOR ANY OPERATING SYSTEM.

COMPETITORS

TO THE VERSIONS OF OFFICE INCLUDED IN D&C LICENSING INCLUDE GLOBAL APPLICATION VENDORS SUCH AS APPLE AND GOOGLE, NUMEROUS WEB-BASED COMPETITORS, AND LOCAL APPLICATION DEVELOPERS IN ASIA AND EUROPE. APPLE DISTRIBUTES VERSIONS OF ITS PRE-INSTALLED

APPLICATION SOFTWARE, SUCH AS EMAIL, NOTE TAKING, AND CALENDAR PRODUCTS, THROUGH ITS PCS, TABLETS, AND PHONES. GOOGLE PROVIDES A HOSTED MESSAGING AND PRODUCTIVITY SUITE AND DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES THROUGH THE ANDROID AND CHROME

OPERATING SYSTEMS. WEB-BASED OFFERINGS COMPETING WITH INDIVIDUAL APPLICATIONS CAN ALSO POSITION THEMSELVES AS ALTERNATIVES TO OUR PRODUCTS. WE BELIEVE OUR PRODUCTS COMPETE EFFECTIVELY BASED ON OUR STRATEGY OF PROVIDING POWERFUL, FLEXIBLE, SECURE,

AND EASY TO USE SOLUTIONS THAT WORK ACROSS A VARIETY OF DEVICES.

WINDOWS PHONE OPERATING SYSTEM FACES COMPETITION FROM IOS, ANDROID,

AND BLACKBERRY OPERATING SYSTEMS. WINDOWS PHONE COMPETES BASED ON DIFFERENTIATED USER INTERFACE, PERSONALIZED APPLICATIONS, COMPATIBILITY WITH WINDOWS PCS AND TABLETS, AND OTHER UNIQUE CAPABILITIES.

COMPUTING AND GAMING HARDWARE

THE

PRINCIPAL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PROVIDED BY THE COMPUTING AND GAMING HARDWARE SEGMENT ARE: XBOX GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES AND ACCESSORIES, SECOND-PARTY AND THIRD-PARTY VIDEO GAME ROYALTIES, AND XBOX LIVE SUBSCRIPTIONS (XBOX

THE XBOX PLATFORM IS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE A UNIQUE

VARIETY OF ENTERTAINMENT CHOICES THROUGH THE USE OF OUR DEVICES, PERIPHERALS, CONTENT, AND ONLINE SERVICES. WE RELEASED XBOX 360 AND XBOX ONE IN NOVEMBER 2005 AND NOVEMBER 2013, RESPECTIVELY.

SURFACE DEVICES ARE DESIGNED TO HELP ORGANIZATIONS, STUDENTS, AND CONSUMERS TO BE MORE PRODUCTIVE, OFFERING ACCESSORIES AND COMPATIBILITY WITH

PERIPHERALS. SURFACE DEVICES WERE FIRST RELEASED IN OCTOBER 2012. OUR LATEST SURFACE DEVICE, THE SURFACE PRO 3, WAS RELEASED IN JUNE 2014.

COMPETITION

OUR XBOX PLATFORM COMPETES

WITH CONSOLE PLATFORMS FROM SONY AND NINTENDO, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE A LARGE, ESTABLISHED BASE OF CUSTOMERS. THE LIFECYCLE FOR GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES AVERAGES FIVE TO TEN YEARS. NINTENDO RELEASED THEIR LATEST GENERATION CONSOLE IN NOVEMBER

2012. SONY RELEASED THEIR LATEST GENERATION CONSOLE IN NOVEMBER 2013.

WE BELIEVE THE SUCCESS OF GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT CONSOLES IS

DETERMINED BY THE AVAILABILITY OF GAMES FOR THE CONSOLE, PROVIDING EXCLUSIVE GAME CONTENT THAT GAMERS SEEK, THE COMPUTATIONAL POWER AND RELIABILITY OF THE CONSOLE, AND THE ABILITY TO CREATE NEW EXPERIENCES VIA ONLINE SERVICES, DOWNLOADABLE CONTENT,

AND PERIPHERALS. IN ADDITION TO SONY AND NINTENDO, WE COMPETE WITH OTHER PROVIDERS OF ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES THROUGH ONLINE MARKETPLACES. WE BELIEVE THE XBOX PLATFORM IS EFFECTIVELY POSITIONED AGAINST COMPETITIVE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES BASED ON

SIGNIFICANT INNOVATION IN HARDWARE ARCHITECTURE, USER INTERFACE, DEVELOPER TOOLS, ONLINE GAMING AND ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES, AND CONTINUED STRONG EXCLUSIVE CONTENT FROM OUR OWN GAME FRANCHISES AS WELL AS OTHER DIGITAL CONTENT OFFERINGS.

BECOMES UNAVAILABLE OR UNABLE TO MEET OUR REQUIREMENTS.

WITH THE ACQUISITION OF NDS, WE NOW OPERATE MANUFACTURING FACILITIES FOR THE

PRODUCTION AND CUSTOMIZATION OF PHONES IN BRAZIL, CHINA, HUNGARY, MEXICO, AND VIETNAM.

ALL OUR DEVICES MAY INCLUDE KEY COMPONENTS THAT

ARE AVAILABLE FROM ONLY ONE OR LIMITED SOURCES. DISRUPTION OF COMPONENT SUPPLY FROM THESE SUPPLIERS COULD POTENTIALLY LEAD TO A DISRUPTION OF PRODUCTION OF CERTAIN DEVICES.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

DURING FISCAL YEARS 2014, 2013, AND 2012, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $11.4 BILLION, $10.4 BILLION, AND $9.8 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

THESE AMOUNTS REPRESENTED 13% OF REVENUE IN EACH OF THOSE YEARS. WE PLAN TO CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EFFORTS.

PRODUCT AND SERVICE DEVELOPMENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY

WE DEVELOP MOST OF OUR PRODUCTS AND

SERVICES INTERNALLY THROUGH FOUR PRIMARY ENGINEERING GROUPS.



APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES ENGINEERING GROUP

, FOCUSES ON BROAD APPLICATIONS AND SERVICES CORE TECHNOLOGIES IN PRODUCTIVITY, COMMUNICATION, SEARCH, AND

OTHER INFORMATION CATEGORIES.



CLOUD AND ENTERPRISE ENGINEERING GROUP

, FOCUSES ON DEVELOPMENT OF MICROSOFTS BACK-END TECHNOLOGIES LIKE DATACENTER, DATABASE, AND OUR SPECIFIC

TECHNOLOGIES FOR ENTERPRISE IT SCENARIOS AND DEVELOPMENT TOOLS. THIS GROUP ALSO ENGINEERS DATACENTER DEVELOPMENT, CONSTRUCTION, AND OPERATION.



DEVICES ENGINEERING GROUP

, FOCUSES ON ALL HARDWARE DEVELOPMENT AND SUPPLY CHAIN, INCLUDING XBOX CONSOLES, SURFACE DEVICES, LUMIA SMARTPHONES, OTHER

NON-LUMIA PHONES, PERCEPTIVE PIXEL PRODUCTS, AND ACCESSORIES.



OPERATING SYSTEMS ENGINEERING GROUP

, FOCUSES ON MICROSOFTS OPERATING SYSTEMS FOR CONSOLES, MOBILE DEVICES, PCS, AND BACK-END SYSTEMS. STUDIOS AND

UNIVERSAL STORE, THE CORE CLOUD SERVICES FOR MARKETPLACES, MEMBERSHIP, AND COMMERCE PLATFORM, ARE ALSO IN THIS GROUP.

INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS US TO MAINTAIN COMPETITIVE ADVANTAGES THAT COME FROM PRODUCT DIFFERENTIATION AND CLOSER TECHNICAL CONTROL OVER OUR

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. IT ALSO GIVES US THE FREEDOM TO DECIDE WHICH MODIFICATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS ARE MOST IMPORTANT AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. WE STRIVE TO OBTAIN INFORMATION AS EARLY AS POSSIBLE ABOUT CHANGING USAGE PATTERNS AND

HARDWARE ADVANCES THAT MAY AFFECT SOFTWARE DESIGN. BEFORE RELEASING NEW SOFTWARE PLATFORMS, WE PROVIDE APPLICATION VENDORS WITH A RANGE OF RESOURCES AND GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, AND TESTING. GENERALLY, WE ALSO CREATE PRODUCT

DOCUMENTATION INTERNALLY.

WE PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INVESTMENTS IN A VARIETY OF WAYS. WE WORK ACTIVELY IN THE U.S. AND

INTERNATIONALLY TO ENSURE THE ENFORCEMENT OF COPYRIGHT, TRADEMARK, TRADE SECRET, AND OTHER PROTECTIONS THAT APPLY TO OUR SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE PRODUCTS, SERVICES, BUSINESS PLANS, AND BRANDING. WE ARE A LEADER AMONG TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES IN PURSUING

PATENTS AND CURRENTLY HAVE A PORTFOLIO OF OVER 55,000 U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL PATENTS ISSUED AND OVER 40,000 PENDING. WHILE WE EMPLOY MUCH OF OUR INTERNALLY DEVELOPED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY EXCLUSIVELY IN MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE ALSO

ENGAGE IN OUTBOUND AND INBOUND LICENSING OF SPECIFIC PATENTED TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE INCORPORATED INTO LICENSEES OR MICROSOFTS PRODUCTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE ENTER INTO BROADER CROSS-LICENSE AGREEMENTS WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGY COMPANIES

COVERING ENTIRE GROUPS OF PATENTS. WE ALSO PURCHASE OR LICENSE TECHNOLOGY THAT WE INCORPORATE INTO OUR PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. AT TIMES, WE MAKE SELECT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY BROADLY AVAILABLE AT NO OR LOW COST TO ACHIEVE A STRATEGIC OBJECTIVE, SUCH AS

PROMOTING INDUSTRY STANDARDS, ADVANCING INTEROPERABILITY, OR ATTRACTING AND ENABLING OUR EXTERNAL DEVELOPMENT COMMUNITY. IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE NDS ACQUISITION, WE RECEIVED AN INITIAL 10-YEAR NON-EXCLUSIVE LICENSE TO CERTAIN NOKIA PATENTS. WE ALSO

AGREED TO LICENSE NOKIAS MAPPING SERVICES AND GRANTED NOKIA RECIPROCAL RIGHTS TO USE OUR PATENTS FOR THEIR MAPPING AND LOCATION SERVICES.

WHILE IT MAY BE NECESSARY IN THE FUTURE TO SEEK OR RENEW LICENSES RELATING TO VARIOUS ASPECTS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND BUSINESS METHODS, WE BELIEVE, BASED UPON PAST EXPERIENCE AND INDUSTRY PRACTICE, SUCH LICENSES

GENERALLY COULD BE OBTAINED ON COMMERCIALLY REASONABLE TERMS. WE BELIEVE OUR CONTINUING RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT ARE NOT MATERIALLY DEPENDENT ON ANY SINGLE LICENSE OR OTHER AGREEMENT WITH A THIRD PARTY RELATING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF OUR

PRODUCTS.

INVESTING IN THE FUTURE

MICROSOFTS SUCCESS IS BASED ON OUR ABILITY TO CREATE NEW AND COMPELLING PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND EXPERIENCES FOR OUR USERS, TO INITIATE AND EMBRACE DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, TO ENTER NEW GEOGRAPHIC AND

PRODUCT MARKETS, AND TO DRIVE BROAD ADOPTION OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE INVEST IN A RANGE OF EMERGING TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND

BREAKTHROUGHS THAT WE BELIEVE OFFER SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DELIVER VALUE TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND GROWTH FOR THE COMPANY. WE MAINTAIN OUR LONG-TERM COMMITMENT TO RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACROSS

A WIDE SPECTRUM OF TECHNOLOGIES, TOOLS, AND PLATFORMS SPANNING COMMUNICATION AND COLLABORATION, INFORMATION ACCESS AND ORGANIZATION, ENTERTAINMENT, BUSINESS AND E-COMMERCE, ADVERTISING, AND DEVICES.

WHILE OUR MAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES ARE LOCATED IN REDMOND, WASHINGTON, WE ALSO OPERATE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FACILITIES IN OTHER

PARTS OF THE U.S. AND AROUND THE WORLD, INCLUDING CANADA, CHINA, DENMARK, ESTONIA, FINLAND, INDIA, IRELAND, ISRAEL, NORWAY, SWEDEN, TAIWAN, AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THIS GLOBAL APPROACH HELPS US REMAIN COMPETITIVE IN LOCAL MARKETS AND ENABLES US TO

CONTINUE TO ATTRACT TOP TALENT FROM ACROSS THE WORLD. WE GENERALLY FUND RESEARCH AT THE CORPORATE LEVEL TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE LOOKING BEYOND IMMEDIATE PRODUCT CONSIDERATIONS TO OPPORTUNITIES FURTHER IN THE FUTURE. WE ALSO FUND RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES AT THE BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL. MUCH OF OUR BUSINESS SEGMENT LEVEL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT IS COORDINATED WITH OTHER SEGMENTS AND LEVERAGED ACROSS THE COMPANY.

IN ADDITION TO OUR MAIN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT OPERATIONS, WE ALSO OPERATE MICROSOFT RESEARCH. MICROSOFT RESEARCH IS ONE OF THE WORLDS

LARGEST COMPUTER SCIENCE RESEARCH ORGANIZATIONS, AND WORKS IN CLOSE COLLABORATION WITH TOP UNIVERSITIES AROUND THE WORLD TO ADVANCE THE STATE-OF-THE-ART IN COMPUTER SCIENCE, PROVIDING US A UNIQUE PERSPECTIVE ON FUTURE TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND

CONTRIBUTING TO OUR PRODUCT AND SERVICE INNOVATION.

BASED ON OUR ASSESSMENT OF KEY TECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND OUR BROAD FOCUS ON LONG-TERM

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, WE SEE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES TO DRIVE FUTURE GROWTH IN PRODUCTIVITY, PLATFORMS, CLOUD COMPUTING, SEARCH, COMMUNICATIONS, AND SMART CONNECTED DEVICES.

DISTRIBUTION, SALES, AND MARKETING

WE MARKET AND DISTRIBUTE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PRIMARILY THROUGH THE FOLLOWING CHANNELS: OEMS; DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS; ONLINE; AND MICROSOFT RETAIL STORES.

OEMS

WE DISTRIBUTE SOFTWARE THROUGH OEMS

THAT PRE-INSTALL OUR SOFTWARE ON NEW PCS, TABLETS, SERVERS, SMARTPHONES, AND OTHER INTELLIGENT DEVICES THAT THEY SELL TO END CUSTOMERS. THE LARGEST COMPONENT OF THE OEM BUSINESS IS THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM PRE-INSTALLED ON COMPUTING DEVICES.

OEMS ALSO SELL HARDWARE PRE-INSTALLED WITH OTHER MICROSOFT PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SERVER AND EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEMS AND APPLICATIONS SUCH AS OUR MICROSOFT OFFICE SUITE. IN ADDITION TO THESE PRODUCTS, WE ALSO MARKET OUR SERVICES THROUGH OEMS AND

SERVICE BUNDLES SUCH AS WINDOWS WITH BING OR WINDOWS WITH OFFICE 365 SUBSCRIPTION.

THERE ARE TWO BROAD CATEGORIES OF OEMS. THE LARGEST

OEMS, MANY OF WHICH OPERATE GLOBALLY, ARE REFERRED TO AS DIRECT OEMS, AS OUR RELATIONSHIP WITH THEM IS MANAGED THROUGH A DIRECT AGREEMENT BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND THE OEM. WE HAVE DISTRIBUTION AGREEMENTS COVERING ONE OR MORE OF OUR PRODUCTS

WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE MULTINATIONAL OEMS, INCLUDING ACER, ASUS, DELL, FUJITSU, HTC, HEWLETT-PACKARD, LG, LENOVO, SAMSUNG, SONY, TOSHIBA, AND WITH MANY REGIONAL AND LOCAL OEMS. THE SECOND BROAD CATEGORY OF OEMS CONSISTS OF LOWER-VOLUME PC

MANUFACTURERS (ALSO CALLED SYSTEM BUILDERS), WHICH SOURCE THEIR MICROSOFT SOFTWARE FOR PRE-INSTALLATION AND LOCAL REDISTRIBUTION PRIMARILY THROUGH THE MICROSOFT DISTRIBUTOR CHANNEL RATHER THAN THROUGH A DIRECT AGREEMENT OR RELATIONSHIP

WITH MICROSOFT.

DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS

MANY ORGANIZATIONS THAT LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS TRANSACT DIRECTLY WITH US, WITH SALES SUPPORT FROM SOLUTION INTEGRATORS, INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS, WEB AGENCIES, AND

DEVELOPERS THAT ADVISE ORGANIZATIONS ON LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT DIRECT ADVISORS, OR EDAS). ORGANIZATIONS ALSO LICENSE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES INDIRECTLY, PRIMARILY THROUGH LICENSE SOLUTIONS

PARTNERS (LSPS), DISTRIBUTORS, VALUE-ADDED RESELLERS (VARS), OEMS, SYSTEM BUILDER CHANNELS, AND RETAILERS. ALTHOUGH EACH TYPE OF

RESELLING PARTNER REACHES ORGANIZATIONS OF ALL SIZES, LSPS ARE PRIMARILY ENGAGED WITH LARGE ORGANIZATIONS, DISTRIBUTORS RESELL PRIMARILY TO VARS, AND VARS TYPICALLY REACH SMALL-SIZED AND

MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS. EDAS TYPICALLY ARE ALSO AUTHORIZED AS LSPS AND OPERATE AS RESELLERS FOR OUR OTHER LICENSING PROGRAMS, SUCH AS THE SELECT PLUS AND OPEN LICENSING PROGRAMS DISCUSSED UNDER LICENSING OPTIONS BELOW. SOME OF OUR

DISTRIBUTORS INCLUDE INGRAM MICRO AND TECH DATA, AND SOME OF OUR LARGEST RESELLERS INCLUDE CDW, DELL, INSIGHT ENTERPRISES, AND SOFTWARE HOUSE INTERNATIONAL.

OUR MICROSOFT DYNAMICS SOFTWARE OFFERINGS ARE ALSO LICENSED TO ENTERPRISES THROUGH A GLOBAL NETWORK OF CHANNEL PARTNERS PROVIDING VERTICAL SOLUTIONS AND SPECIALIZED SERVICES. WE DISTRIBUTE OUR RETAIL PACKAGED

PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH INDEPENDENT NON-EXCLUSIVE DISTRIBUTORS, AUTHORIZED REPLICATORS, RESELLERS, AND RETAIL OUTLETS. INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS OBTAIN THESE PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH RETAIL OUTLETS, SUCH AS WAL-MART, DIXONS, AND MICROSOFT RETAIL

STORES. WE DISTRIBUTE OUR HARDWARE PRODUCTS, INCLUDING SURFACE, XBOX, PHONES, AND PC ACCESSORIES, THROUGH THIRD-PARTY RETAILERS AND MICROSOFT RETAIL STORES. OUR PHONES ARE ALSO DISTRIBUTED THROUGH GLOBAL WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS CARRIERS. WE HAVE A

NETWORK OF FIELD SALES REPRESENTATIVES AND FIELD SUPPORT PERSONNEL THAT SOLICITS ORDERS FROM DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS, AND PROVIDES PRODUCT TRAINING AND SALES SUPPORT.

ONLINE

ALTHOUGH ON-PREMISES SOFTWARE WILL CONTINUE TO BE AN IMPORTANT PART OF OUR BUSINESS,

INCREASINGLY WE ARE DELIVERING ADDITIONAL VALUE TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. WE PROVIDE ONLINE CONTENT AND SERVICES TO CONSUMERS THROUGH BING, MSN PORTALS AND CHANNELS, OFFICE 365, WINDOWS PHONE STORE, XBOX LIVE, OUTLOOK.COM, SKYPE,

AND WINDOWS STORE. WE ALSO PROVIDE COMMERCIAL CLOUD-BASED SERVICES SUCH AS MICROSOFT DYNAMICS CRM ONLINE, MICROSOFT AZURE, AND OFFICE 365 CONSISTING OF ONLINE VERSIONS OF MICROSOFT OFFICE, EXCHANGE, SHAREPOINT, LYNC, AND YAMMER. OTHER SERVICES

DELIVERED ONLINE INCLUDE OUR ONLINE ADVERTISING PLATFORM WITH OFFERINGS FOR ADVERTISERS AND PUBLISHERS, AS WELL AS MICROSOFT DEVELOPER NETWORK SUBSCRIPTION CONTENT AND UPDATES, PERIODIC PRODUCT UPDATES, AND ONLINE TECHNICAL AND PRACTICE READINESS

RESOURCES TO SUPPORT OUR PARTNERS IN DEVELOPING AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SOLUTIONS. AS WE INCREASINGLY DELIVER ONLINE SERVICES, WE SELL MANY OF THESE CLOUD-BASED SERVICES THROUGH OUR ENTERPRISE AGREEMENTS AND HAVE ALSO ENABLED NEW SALES PROGRAMS

TO REACH SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES. THESE NEW PROGRAMS INCLUDE DIRECT SALES, DIRECT SALES SUPPORTED BY A LARGE NETWORK OF PARTNER ADVISORS, AND RESELL OF SERVICES THROUGH OPERATOR CHANNELS, SUCH AS TELEPHONE, CELL, AND CABLE PROVIDERS.

WE ALSO SELL OUR PRODUCTS THROUGH OUR MICROSOFT RETAIL STORES AND ONLINE MARKETPLACES.

LICENSING OPTIONS

WE

LICENSE SOFTWARE TO ORGANIZATIONS UNDER AGREEMENTS THAT ALLOW THE CUSTOMER TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR AGREEMENTS FOR ORGANIZATIONS TO ACQUIRE MULTIPLE LICENSES OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ARE DESIGNED TO PROVIDE THEM

WITH A MEANS OF DOING SO WITHOUT HAVING TO ACQUIRE SEPARATE LICENSES THROUGH RETAIL CHANNELS. IN DELIVERING ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSING AGREEMENTS TO THE MARKET, WE USE DIFFERENT PROGRAMS DESIGNED TO PROVIDE FLEXIBILITY FOR ORGANIZATIONS OF VARIOUS

SIZES. WHILE THESE PROGRAMS MAY DIFFER IN VARIOUS PARTS OF THE WORLD, GENERALLY THEY INCLUDE THOSE DISCUSSED BELOW.

CUSTOMER LICENSING PROGRAMS

OPEN LICENSING

DESIGNED

PRIMARILY FOR SMALL-TO-MEDIUM ORGANIZATIONS, OPEN PROGRAMS ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL OR SUBSCRIPTION LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (TWO OR THREE

YEARS DEPENDING ON THE OPEN PROGRAMS USED). THE OFFERING THAT CONVEYS RIGHTS TO FUTURE VERSIONS OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD IS CALLED SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. SOFTWARE ASSURANCE ALSO PROVIDES SUPPORT, TOOLS, AND TRAINING TO HELP

CUSTOMERS DEPLOY AND USE SOFTWARE EFFICIENTLY. OPEN PROGRAMS HAS SEVERAL VARIATIONS TO FIT CUSTOMERS DIVERSE WAY OF PURCHASING. UNDER THE OPEN PROGRAM, CUSTOMERS CAN ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY OR LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE. THEY CAN ALSO

RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING VOLUME LICENSING AGREEMENTS. OFFICE 365 IS ALSO AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE THROUGH THE OPEN PROGRAM.

DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR MEDIUM-TO-LARGE ORGANIZATIONS, THE SELECT PLUS PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES AND, AT THE CUSTOMERS ELECTION, SOFTWARE ASSURANCE OVER A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD

(GENERALLY THREE YEARS OR LESS). SIMILAR TO OPEN PROGRAMS, THE SELECT PLUS PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE LICENSES ONLY, ACQUIRE LICENSES WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, OR RENEW SOFTWARE ASSURANCE UPON THE EXPIRATION OF EXISTING VOLUME LICENSING

AGREEMENTS. A SUBSET OF ONLINE SERVICES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE THROUGH THE SELECT PLUS PROGRAM, AND SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED WITH TERMS BETWEEN ONE AND THREE YEARS.

ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT LICENSING

DESIGNED PRIMARILY FOR MEDIUM- AND LARGE-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS

THAT WANT TO ACQUIRE LICENSES TO ONLINE SERVICES AND/OR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, ALONG WITH SOFTWARE ASSURANCE, FOR ALL OR SUBSTANTIAL PARTS OF THEIR ENTERPRISE. ENTERPRISES CAN ELECT TO ACQUIRE PERPETUAL LICENSES OR, UNDER THE ENTERPRISE SUBSCRIPTION

PROGRAM, CAN ACQUIRE NON-PERPETUAL, SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENTS FOR A SPECIFIED TIME PERIOD (GENERALLY THREE YEARS). ONLINE SERVICES ARE ALSO AVAILABLE FOR PURCHASE THROUGH THE ENTERPRISE AGREEMENT AND SUBSCRIPTIONS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED WITH THREE

YEAR TERMS.

CUSTOMER LICENSING PROGRAMS  ONLINE SERVICES ONLY

MICROSOFT ONLINE SUBSCRIPTION AGREEMENT IS DESIGNED TO ENABLE SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES TO EASILY PURCHASE MICROSOFT ONLINE SERVICES (EXCLUDING AZURE). THE PROGRAM ALLOWS CUSTOMERS TO ACQUIRE MONTHLY OR

ANNUAL SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES.

MICROSOFT AZURE AGREEMENT IS DESIGNED TO ENABLE SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED BUSINESSES TO

PURCHASE MICROSOFT AZURE SUBSCRIPTION PLANS ON A PAY-AS-YOU-GO BASIS.

PARTNER PROGRAMS

THE MICROSOFT SERVICES PROVIDER LICENSE AGREEMENT IS A PROGRAM TARGETED AT SERVICE PROVIDERS AND INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDORS ALLOWING THESE

PARTNERS TO PROVIDE SOFTWARE SERVICES AND HOSTED APPLICATIONS TO THEIR END CUSTOMERS. AGREEMENTS ARE GENERALLY STRUCTURED WITH A THREE-YEAR TERM, AND PARTNERS ARE BILLED MONTHLY BASED UPON CONSUMPTION.

MICROSOFT ONLINE SERVICES RESELLER AGREEMENT IS A PROGRAM ENABLING PARTNERS TO PACKAGE MICROSOFT ONLINE SERVICES WITH THE PARTNERS SERVICES.

INDEPENDENT SOFTWARE VENDOR ROYALTY PROGRAM IS A PROGRAM THAT ENABLES PARTNERS TO USE MICROSOFT SOFTWARE IN THEIR OWN SOFTWARE

PROGRAMS.

CUSTOMERS

OUR CUSTOMERS INCLUDE INDIVIDUAL CONSUMERS, SMALL- AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS, ENTERPRISES, GOVERNMENTAL INSTITUTIONS, EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTIONS, INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS, APPLICATION DEVELOPERS, AND OEMS.

CONSUMERS AND SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED ORGANIZATIONS OBTAIN OUR PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH DISTRIBUTORS, RESELLERS, AND OEMS. NO SALES TO AN INDIVIDUAL CUSTOMER ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 10% OF FISCAL YEAR 2014, 2013, OR 2012 REVENUE. OUR PRACTICE IS TO

SHIP OUR PRODUCTS PROMPTLY UPON RECEIPT OF PURCHASE ORDERS FROM CUSTOMERS; CONSEQUENTLY, BACKLOG IS NOT SIGNIFICANT.

ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

OUR OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL RESULTS ARE SUBJECT TO VARIOUS RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES, INCLUDING THOSE DESCRIBED BELOW, THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS, FINANCIAL CONDITION, RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, CASH

FLOWS, AND THE TRADING PRICE OF OUR COMMON STOCK.

WE FACE INTENSE COMPETITION ACROSS ALL MARKETS FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WHICH MAY LEAD TO

LOWER REVENUE OR OPERATING MARGINS.

COMPETITION IN THE TECHNOLOGY SECTOR

OUR COMPETITORS RANGE IN SIZE FROM DIVERSIFIED GLOBAL COMPANIES WITH SIGNIFICANT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES TO SMALL, SPECIALIZED FIRMS

WHOSE NARROWER PRODUCT LINES MAY LET THEM BE MORE EFFECTIVE IN DEPLOYING TECHNICAL, MARKETING, AND FINANCIAL RESOURCES. BARRIERS TO ENTRY IN OUR BUSINESSES ARE LOW AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS CAN

15

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1A

BE DISTRIBUTED BROADLY AND QUICKLY AT RELATIVELY LOW COST. MANY OF THE AREAS IN WHICH WE COMPETE EVOLVE RAPIDLY WITH CHANGING AND DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGIES, SHIFTING USER NEEDS, AND FREQUENT

INTRODUCTIONS OF NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. OUR ABILITY TO REMAIN COMPETITIVE DEPENDS ON OUR SUCCESS IN MAKING INNOVATIVE PRODUCTS, DEVICES, AND SERVICES THAT APPEAL TO BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS.

COMPETITION AMONG PLATFORMS, ECOSYSTEMS, AND DEVICES

AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN TO CREATE PLATFORM-BASED ECOSYSTEMS ON WHICH MANY PARTICIPANTS CAN BUILD DIVERSE SOLUTIONS. A WELL-ESTABLISHED ECOSYSTEM CREATES BENEFICIAL NETWORK EFFECTS AMONG

USERS, APPLICATION DEVELOPERS, AND THE PLATFORM PROVIDER THAT CAN ACCELERATE GROWTH. ESTABLISHING SIGNIFICANT SCALE IN THE MARKETPLACE IS NECESSARY TO ACHIEVE AND MAINTAIN ATTRACTIVE MARGINS. THE STRATEGIC IMPORTANCE OF DEVELOPING AND MAINTAINING A

VIBRANT ECOSYSTEM INCREASED WITH THE LAUNCH OF THE WINDOWS 8 OPERATING SYSTEM, SURFACE, WINDOWS PHONE, XBOX ONE, AND ASSOCIATED CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM FIRMS THAT PROVIDE COMPETING PLATFORMS, APPLICATIONS, AND

SERVICES.



A COMPETING VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED MODEL, IN WHICH A SINGLE FIRM CONTROLS THE SOFTWARE AND HARDWARE ELEMENTS OF A PRODUCT AND RELATED SERVICES, HAS SUCCEEDED

WITH SOME CONSUMER PRODUCTS SUCH AS PERSONAL COMPUTERS, TABLETS, PHONES, GAMING CONSOLES, AND DIGITAL MUSIC PLAYERS. COMPETITORS PURSUING THIS MODEL ALSO EARN REVENUE FROM SERVICES INTEGRATED WITH THE HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PLATFORM. WE ALSO OFFER

SOME VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES; HOWEVER, OUR COMPETITORS IN SMARTPHONES AND TABLETS HAVE ESTABLISHED SIGNIFICANTLY LARGER USER BASES. COMPETING WITH THE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED MODEL WILL INCREASE OUR COST OF

REVENUE AND REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.



WE DERIVE SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE FROM LICENSES OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS ON PERSONAL COMPUTERS. WE FACE SIGNIFICANT COMPETITION FROM COMPETING PLATFORMS

DEVELOPED FOR NEW DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS SUCH AS SMARTPHONES AND TABLET COMPUTERS. THESE DEVICES COMPETE ON MULTIPLE BASES INCLUDING PRICE AND THE PERCEIVED UTILITY OF THE DEVICE AND ITS PLATFORM. USERS ARE INCREASINGLY TURNING TO THESE DEVICES TO

PERFORM FUNCTIONS THAT IN THE PAST WERE PERFORMED BY PERSONAL COMPUTERS. EVEN IF MANY USERS VIEW THESE DEVICES AS COMPLEMENTARY TO A PERSONAL COMPUTER, THE PREVALENCE OF THESE DEVICES MAY MAKE IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ATTRACT APPLICATION DEVELOPERS TO

OUR PLATFORMS. COMPETING OPERATING SYSTEMS LICENSED AT LOW OR NO COST MAY DECREASE PC OPERATING SYSTEM MARGINS. IN ADDITION, SURFACE COMPETES WITH PRODUCTS MADE BY OUR OEM PARTNERS, WHICH MAY AFFECT THEIR COMMITMENT TO OUR PLATFORM.



THE SUCCESS OF THE WINDOWS PHONE PLATFORM IS AN IMPORTANT ELEMENT OF OUR GOAL TO ENHANCE PERSONAL PRODUCTIVITY IN A MOBILE-FIRST AND CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. THE

MARKETPLACE AMONG MOBILE PHONE PLATFORMS IS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. WE MAY FACE ISSUES IN SELECTING, ENGAGING OR SECURING SUPPORT FROM OPERATORS AND RETAILERS FOR WINDOWS PHONES DUE TO, FOR INSTANCE, INADEQUATE SALES TRAINING OR INCENTIVES, OR

INSUFFICIENT MARKETING SUPPORT FOR THE WINDOWS PHONE PLATFORM.



COMPETING PLATFORMS HAVE APPLICATION MARKETPLACES (SOMETIMES REFERRED TO AS STORES) WITH SCALE AND SIGNIFICANT INSTALLED BASES ON MOBILE DEVICES.

THE VARIETY AND UTILITY OF APPLICATIONS AVAILABLE ON A PLATFORM IS IMPORTANT TO DEVICE PURCHASING DECISIONS. USERS INCUR COSTS TO MOVE DATA AND BUY NEW APPLICATIONS WHEN SWITCHING PLATFORMS. TO COMPETE, WE MUST SUCCESSFULLY ENLIST DEVELOPERS TO

WRITE APPLICATIONS FOR OUR MARKETPLACE AND ENSURE THAT THESE APPLICATIONS HAVE HIGH QUALITY, CUSTOMER APPEAL, AND VALUE. EFFORTS TO COMPETE WITH THESE APPLICATION MARKETPLACES MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE AND LOWER OUR OPERATING MARGINS.

BUSINESS MODEL COMPETITION

COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US BASED ON A GROWING VARIETY OF BUSINESS MODELS.



EVEN AS WE TRANSITION TO A MOBILE-FIRST AND CLOUD-FIRST STRATEGY, THE LICENSE-BASED PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE MODEL GENERATES MOST OF OUR SOFTWARE REVENUE. WE BEAR

THE COSTS OF CONVERTING ORIGINAL IDEAS INTO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OFFSETTING THESE COSTS WITH THE REVENUE RECEIVED FROM LICENSING OUR PRODUCTS. MANY OF OUR COMPETITORS ALSO DEVELOP AND SELL SOFTWARE TO

BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS UNDER THIS MODEL.

16

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1A



OTHER COMPETITORS DEVELOP AND OFFER FREE APPLICATIONS, ONLINE SERVICES AND CONTENT, AND MAKE MONEY BY SELLING THIRD-PARTY ADVERTISING. ADVERTISING REVENUE

FUNDS DEVELOPMENT OF PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THESE COMPETITORS PROVIDE TO USERS AT NO OR LITTLE COST, COMPETING DIRECTLY WITH OUR REVENUE-GENERATING PRODUCTS.



SOME COMPANIES COMPETE WITH US USING AN OPEN SOURCE BUSINESS MODEL BY MODIFYING AND THEN DISTRIBUTING OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE AT NOMINAL COST TO END-USERS AND

EARNING REVENUE ON ADVERTISING OR COMPLEMENTARY SERVICES AND PRODUCTS. THESE FIRMS DO NOT BEAR THE FULL COSTS OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE SOFTWARE. SOME OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE VENDORS DEVELOP SOFTWARE THAT MIMICS THE FEATURES AND FUNCTIONALITY

OF OUR PRODUCTS.

THE COMPETITIVE PRESSURES DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY CAUSE DECREASED SALES VOLUMES, PRICE REDUCTIONS,

AND/OR INCREASED OPERATING COSTS, SUCH AS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, MARKETING, AND SALES INCENTIVES. THIS MAY LEAD TO LOWER REVENUE, GROSS MARGINS, AND OPERATING INCOME.

OUR INCREASING FOCUS ON SERVICES PRESENTS EXECUTION AND COMPETITIVE RISKS.

A GROWING PART OF OUR BUSINESS INVOLVES CLOUD-BASED SERVICES AVAILABLE ACROSS THE SPECTRUM OF COMPUTING

DEVICES. IN JULY 2014, OUR LEADERSHIP ANNOUNCED ITS STRATEGIC VISION TO COMPETE AND GROW AS A PRODUCTIVITY AND PLATFORM COMPANY FOR THE MOBILE-FIRST AND CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. AT THE SAME TIME, OUR COMPETITORS ARE RAPIDLY DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING

CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESS CUSTOMERS. PRICING AND DELIVERY MODELS ARE EVOLVING. DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS INFLUENCE HOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD AND SOMETIMES THE USERS CHOICE OF WHICH SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED

SERVICES TO USE. WE ARE DEVOTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES TO DEVELOP AND DEPLOY OUR CLOUD-BASED STRATEGIES. THE WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM MUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE WITH THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. WE ARE EMBRACING CULTURAL AND ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES TO DRIVE

ACCOUNTABILITY AND ELIMINATE OBSTACLES TO INNOVATION. BESIDES SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT COSTS, WE ARE INCURRING COSTS TO BUILD AND MAINTAIN INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES. THESE COSTS WILL REDUCE THE OPERATING MARGINS WE HAVE

PREVIOUSLY ACHIEVED. WHETHER WE SUCCEED IN CLOUD-BASED SERVICES DEPENDS ON OUR EXECUTION IN SEVERAL AREAS, INCLUDING.



CONTINUING TO BRING TO MARKET COMPELLING CLOUD-BASED EXPERIENCES THAT GENERATE INCREASING TRAFFIC AND MARKET SHARE;



MAINTAINING THE UTILITY, COMPATIBILITY, AND PERFORMANCE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ON THE GROWING ARRAY OF COMPUTING DEVICES, INCLUDING PCS, SMARTPHONES,

TABLETS, AND TELEVISION-RELATED DEVICES, INCLUDING GAMING CONSOLES;



CONTINUING TO ENHANCE THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR CLOUD PLATFORMS TO THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPERS;



ENSURING OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES MEET THE RELIABILITY EXPECTATIONS OF OUR CUSTOMERS AND MAINTAIN THE SECURITY OF THEIR DATA; AND



MAKING OUR SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES PLATFORM AGNOSTIC, AVAILABLE ON A WIDE RANGE OF DEVICES AND ECOSYSTEMS, INCLUDING THOSE OF OUR COMPETITORS.

IT IS UNCERTAIN WHETHER OUR STRATEGIES WILL ATTRACT THE USERS OR GENERATE THE REVENUE REQUIRED TO SUCCEED. IF WE ARE

NOT EFFECTIVE IN EXECUTING ORGANIZATIONAL CHANGES TO INCREASE EFFICIENCY AND ACCELERATE INNOVATION, OR IF WE FAIL TO GENERATE SUFFICIENT USAGE OF OUR NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, WE MAY NOT GROW REVENUES IN LINE WITH THE INFRASTRUCTURE AND DEVELOPMENT

INVESTMENTS DESCRIBED ABOVE. THIS MAY NEGATIVELY IMPACT GROSS MARGINS AND OPERATING INCOME.

WE MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN NEW

PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE.

WE WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH, DEVELOPMENT, AND MARKETING FOR EXISTING PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING THE WINDOWS OPERATING

SYSTEM, THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM, BING, WINDOWS PHONE, WINDOWS SERVER, THE WINDOWS STORE, THE MICROSOFT AZURE SERVICES PLATFORM, OFFICE 365, OTHER CLOUD-BASED SERVICES OFFERINGS, AND THE XBOX ENTERTAINMENT PLATFORM. WE ALSO INVEST IN THE

DEVELOPMENT AND ACQUISITION OF A VARIETY OF HARDWARE FOR PRODUCTIVITY, COMMUNICATION AND ENTERTAINMENT INCLUDING PCS, TABLETS, PHONES, AND GAMING DEVICES. INVESTMENTS IN NEW TECHNOLOGY ARE SPECULATIVE. COMMERCIAL SUCCESS DEPENDS ON MANY FACTORS,

INCLUDING INNOVATIVENESS, DEVELOPER SUPPORT, AND EFFECTIVE DISTRIBUTION AND MARKETING. IF CUSTOMERS DO NOT PERCEIVE OUR LATEST OFFERINGS AS PROVIDING SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNCTIONALITY OR OTHER VALUE, THEY MAY REDUCE THEIR PURCHASES OF NEW SOFTWARE AND

HARDWARE PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES, UNFAVORABLY AFFECTING REVENUE. WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM NEW PRODUCT, SERVICE, AND

DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL INVESTMENTS FOR SEVERAL YEARS, IF AT ALL. NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY NOT BE PROFITABLE, AND EVEN IF THEY ARE PROFITABLE, OPERATING MARGINS FOR SOME NEW PRODUCTS AND

BUSINESSES WILL NOT BE AS HIGH AS THE MARGINS WE HAVE EXPERIENCED HISTORICALLY.

DEVELOPING NEW TECHNOLOGIES IS COMPLEX AND

TIME-CONSUMING. IT CAN REQUIRE LONG DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PERIODS. SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN NEW RELEASES OR SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN CREATING NEW PRODUCTS OR SERVICES COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE.

ACQUISITIONS, JOINT VENTURES, AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES MAY HAVE AN ADVERSE EFFECT ON OUR BUSINESS.

WE EXPECT TO

CONTINUE MAKING ACQUISITIONS OR ENTERING INTO JOINT VENTURES AND STRATEGIC ALLIANCES AS PART OF OUR LONG-TERM BUSINESS STRATEGY. THESE TRANSACTIONS INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES AND RISKS INCLUDING THAT THE TRANSACTION DOES NOT ADVANCE OUR BUSINESS

STRATEGY, THAT WE GET NO SATISFACTORY RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENT, THAT WE HAVE DIFFICULTY INTEGRATING NEW EMPLOYEES, BUSINESS SYSTEMS, AND TECHNOLOGY, OR THAT THE TRANSACTION DISTRACTS MANAGEMENT FROM OUR OTHER BUSINESSES. THE SUCCESS OF THESE

TRANSACTIONS WILL DEPEND IN PART ON OUR ABILITY TO LEVERAGE THEM ENHANCE OUR EXISTING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES OR DEVELOP COMPELLING NEW ONES. IT MAY TAKE LONGER THAN EXPECTED TO REALIZE THE FULL BENEFITS FROM THESE TRANSACTIONS, SUCH AS INCREASED

REVENUE, ENHANCED EFFICIENCIES, OR INCREASED MARKET SHARE, OR THE BENEFITS MAY ULTIMATELY BE SMALLER THAN WE EXPECTED. THESE EVENTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR OPERATING RESULTS OR FINANCIAL CONDITION.

IN APRIL 2014, WE ACQUIRED FROM NOKIA SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF ITS NDS BUSINESS TO ACCELERATE OUR GROWTH IN PHONES AND SUPPORT THE ENTIRE WINDOWS

ECOSYSTEM. WE MAY NOT REALIZE ALL OF THE ANTICIPATED FINANCIAL AND OTHER BENEFITS FROM THIS TRANSACTION INCLUDING OPERATING EFFICIENCIES AND COST SAVINGS. WE MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL IN DEVELOPING A VIBRANT AND COMPETITIVE ECOSYSTEM FOR WINDOWS-BASED

PHONES THAT COMBINES DIFFERENTIATED HARDWARE, SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND THIRD-PARTY APPLICATIONS. WE MAY NOT ACHIEVE MOBILE PHONE MARKET SHARE TARGETS. WE MAY SEE LOWER THAN EXPECTED GROWTH RATES FOR THE PHONE MARKETS. THE MIX OF PREMIUM AND

LOWER-COST DEVICES WE SELL MAY PUT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON PRICES OR MARGINS. WE MAY NOT BE EFFECTIVE IN EXECUTING THE RESTRUCTURING WE ANNOUNCED IN JULY 2014 OR OTHERWISE INTEGRATING THE NDS BUSINESS WITH MICROSOFTS ONGOING OPERATIONS, INCLUDING

MATCHING MANUFACTURING CAPACITY TO DEMAND. EXISTING MICROSOFT SMART DEVICE ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS MAY RESPOND NEGATIVELY TO THE CHANGES IN OUR BUSINESS OR THE NEW COMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

IF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS BECOME IMPAIRED WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO

EARNINGS.

WE ACQUIRE OTHER COMPANIES AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND MAY NOT REALIZE ALL THE ECONOMIC BENEFIT FROM THOSE ACQUISITIONS, WHICH COULD CAUSE AN IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL OR INTANGIBLES. WE REVIEW OUR AMORTIZABLE

INTANGIBLE ASSETS FOR IMPAIRMENT WHEN EVENTS OR CHANGES IN CIRCUMSTANCES INDICATE THE CARRYING VALUE MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE. WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. FACTORS THAT MAY BE A CHANGE IN CIRCUMSTANCES, INDICATING THAT THE

CARRYING VALUE OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS MAY NOT BE RECOVERABLE, INCLUDE A DECLINE IN OUR STOCK PRICE AND MARKET CAPITALIZATION, REDUCED FUTURE CASH FLOW ESTIMATES, AND SLOWER GROWTH RATES IN INDUSTRY SEGMENTS IN WHICH WE

PARTICIPATE. WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DURING THE PERIOD IN WHICH ANY IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS IS DETERMINED, NEGATIVELY AFFECTING OUR RESULTS OF

OPERATIONS. FOR EXAMPLE, IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2012, WE RECORDED A $6.2 BILLION CHARGE FOR THE IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL IN OUR PREVIOUS ONLINE SERVICES DIVISION BUSINESS (DEVICES AND CONSUMER OTHER UNDER OUR CURRENT SEGMENT STRUCTURE).

THE VALUATION OF ACQUIRED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING GOODWILL, RESULTING FROM THE ACQUISITION OF NDS, IS REFLECTIVE OF THE

ENTERPRISE VALUE BASED ON THE LONG-TERM FINANCIAL FORECAST FOR THE BUSINESS. IN THIS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND VOLATILE MARKET, WE MAY NOT REALIZE OUR FORECASTS. AS A RESULT, WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO RECORD A SIGNIFICANT CHARGE TO EARNINGS IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS DUE TO AN IMPAIRMENT OF OUR GOODWILL OR AMORTIZABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO

ADEQUATELY PROTECT OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

PROTECTING OUR GLOBAL INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND COMBATING UNLICENSED COPYING AND USE OF OUR SOFTWARE AND OTHER INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY IS DIFFICULT. WHILE PIRACY

ADVERSELY AFFECTS U.S. REVENUE, THE IMPACT ON REVENUE FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S. IS MORE SIGNIFICANT, PARTICULARLY IN COUNTRIES WHERE LAWS ARE LESS PROTECTIVE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. OUR REVENUE IN THESE MARKETS MAY GROW SLOWER THAN THE

UNDERLYING DEVICE MARKET. SIMILARLY, THE ABSENCE OF HARMONIZED PATENT LAWS MAKES IT MORE DIFFICULT TO ENSURE CONSISTENT RESPECT FOR PATENT RIGHTS. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, WE EDUCATE CONSUMERS ABOUT THE

18

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1A

BENEFITS OF LICENSING GENUINE PRODUCTS AND OBTAINING INDEMNIFICATION BENEFITS FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RISKS, AND WE EDUCATE LAWMAKERS ABOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF A BUSINESS CLIMATE WHERE

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. REDUCTIONS IN THE LEGAL PROTECTION FOR SOFTWARE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUE.

THIRD PARTIES MAY CLAIM WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

FROM TIME TO TIME, OTHERS CLAIM WE INFRINGE THEIR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THE NUMBER OF THESE CLAIMS MAY

GROW BECAUSE OF CONSTANT TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE MARKETS IN WHICH WE COMPETE, THE EXTENSIVE PATENT COVERAGE OF EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES, THE RAPID RATE OF ISSUANCE OF NEW PATENTS, AND OUR OFFERING OF FIRST-PARTY DEVICES, SUCH AS SURFACE AND LUMIA

PHONES. TO RESOLVE THESE CLAIMS WE MAY ENTER INTO ROYALTY AND LICENSING AGREEMENTS ON TERMS THAT ARE LESS FAVORABLE THAN CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, STOP SELLING OR REDESIGN AFFECTED PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, OR PAY DAMAGES TO SATISFY INDEMNIFICATION

COMMITMENTS WITH OUR CUSTOMERS. THESE OUTCOMES MAY CAUSE OPERATING MARGINS TO DECLINE. BESIDES MONEY DAMAGES, IN SOME JURISDICTIONS PLAINTIFFS CAN SEEK INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT MAY LIMIT OR PREVENT IMPORTING, MARKETING, AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS OR

SERVICES THAT HAVE INFRINGING TECHNOLOGIES. IN SOME COUNTRIES, SUCH AS GERMANY, AN INJUNCTION CAN BE ISSUED BEFORE THE PARTIES HAVE FULLY LITIGATED THE VALIDITY OF THE UNDERLYING PATENTS. WE HAVE PAID SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS TO SETTLE CLAIMS RELATED TO

THE USE OF TECHNOLOGY AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AND TO PROCURE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS AS PART OF OUR STRATEGY TO MANAGE THIS RISK, AND MAY CONTINUE TO DO SO.

WE MAY NOT BE ABLE TO PROTECT OUR SOURCE CODE FROM COPYING IF THERE IS AN UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE CODE.

SOURCE CODE, THE DETAILED PROGRAM COMMANDS FOR OUR OPERATING SYSTEMS

AND OTHER SOFTWARE PROGRAMS, IS CRITICAL TO OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH WE LICENSE PORTIONS OF OUR APPLICATION AND OPERATING SYSTEM SOURCE CODE TO SEVERAL LICENSEES, WE TAKE SIGNIFICANT MEASURES TO PROTECT THE SECRECY OF LARGE PORTIONS OF OUR SOURCE

CODE. IF A SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR SOURCE CODE LEAKS, WE MIGHT LOSE FUTURE TRADE SECRET PROTECTION FOR THAT SOURCE CODE. IT MAY BECOME EASIER FOR THIRD PARTIES TO COMPETE WITH OUR PRODUCTS BY COPYING FUNCTIONALITY, WHICH COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT

OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. UNAUTHORIZED DISCLOSURE OF SOURCE CODE ALSO COULD INCREASE THE SECURITY RISKS DESCRIBED IN THE NEXT PARAGRAPH.

CYBER-ATTACKS AND SECURITY VULNERABILITIES COULD LEAD TO REDUCED REVENUE, INCREASED COSTS, LIABILITY CLAIMS, OR HARM TO OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION.

SECURITY OF MICROSOFTS INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY

THREATS TO INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) SECURITY CAN TAKE A VARIETY OF FORMS. INDIVIDUAL AND GROUPS OF HACKERS, AND SOPHISTICATED ORGANIZATIONS INCLUDING STATE-SPONSORED ORGANIZATIONS, MAY TAKE STEPS

THAT POSE THREATS TO OUR CUSTOMERS AND OUR IT. THEY MAY DEVELOP AND DEPLOY MALICIOUS SOFTWARE TO ATTACK OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND GAIN ACCESS TO OUR NETWORKS AND DATACENTERS, OR ACT IN A COORDINATED MANNER TO LAUNCH DISTRIBUTED DENIAL OF

SERVICE OR OTHER COORDINATED ATTACKS. CYBER THREATS ARE CONSTANTLY EVOLVING, THEREBY INCREASING THE DIFFICULTY OF DETECTING AND SUCCESSFULLY DEFENDING AGAINST THEM. CYBER THREATS CAN HAVE CASCADING IMPACTS THAT UNFOLD WITH INCREASING SPEED ACROSS

OUR INTERNAL NETWORKS AND SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF OUR PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS. BREACHES OF OUR NETWORK OR DATA SECURITY COULD DISRUPT THE SECURITY OF OUR INTERNAL SYSTEMS AND BUSINESS APPLICATIONS, IMPAIR OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE SERVICES TO OUR CUSTOMERS

AND PROTECT THE PRIVACY OF THEIR DATA, RESULT IN PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT DELAYS, COMPROMISE CONFIDENTIAL OR TECHNICAL BUSINESS INFORMATION HARMING OUR COMPETITIVE POSITION, RESULT IN THEFT OR MISUSE OF OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY OR OTHER ASSETS, REQUIRE

US TO ALLOCATE MORE RESOURCES TO IMPROVED TECHNOLOGIES, OR OTHERWISE ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR BUSINESS.

IN ADDITION, OUR INTERNAL IT

ENVIRONMENT CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. OFTEN WE ARE EARLY ADOPTERS OF NEW DEVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES. WE EMBRACE NEW WAYS OF SHARING DATA AND COMMUNICATING INTERNALLY AND WITH PARTNERS AND CUSTOMERS USING METHODS SUCH AS SOCIAL NETWORKING AND OTHER

CONSUMER-ORIENTED TECHNOLOGIES. OUR BUSINESS POLICIES AND INTERNAL SECURITY CONTROLS MAY NOT KEEP PACE WITH THE SPEED OF THESE CHANGES AS NEW THREATS EMERGE.

SECURITY OF OUR PRODUCT, SERVICES, DEVICES AND CUSTOMERS DATA

SECURITY THREATS ARE A

PARTICULAR CHALLENGE TO COMPANIES LIKE US WHOSE BUSINESS IS TECHNOLOGY PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. THREATS TO OUR OWN IT INFRASTRUCTURE CAN ALSO AFFECT OUR CUSTOMERS. CUSTOMERS USING OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES RELY ON THE SECURITY OF OUR INFRASTRUCTURE TO

ENSURE THE RELIABILITY OF OUR SERVICES AND THE PROTECTION OF THEIR DATA. HACKERS

TEND TO FOCUS THEIR EFFORTS ON THE MOST POPULAR OPERATING SYSTEMS, PROGRAMS, AND SERVICES, INCLUDING MANY OF OURS, AND WE EXPECT THAT TO CONTINUE. THE SECURITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES IS

IMPORTANT IN OUR CUSTOMERS PURCHASING DECISIONS.

TO DEFEND AGAINST SECURITY THREATS, BOTH TO OUR INTERNAL IT SYSTEMS AND THOSE OF

OUR CUSTOMERS, WE MUST CONTINUOUSLY ENGINEER MORE SECURE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ENHANCE SECURITY AND RELIABILITY FEATURES, IMPROVE THE DEPLOYMENT OF SOFTWARE UPDATES TO ADDRESS SECURITY VULNERABILITIES, DEVELOP MITIGATION TECHNOLOGIES THAT HELP TO

SECURE CUSTOMERS FROM ATTACKS EVEN WHEN SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE NOT DEPLOYED, MAINTAIN THE DIGITAL SECURITY INFRASTRUCTURE THAT PROTECTS THE INTEGRITY OF OUR NETWORK, PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, AND PROVIDE CUSTOMERS SECURITY TOOLS SUCH AS FIREWALLS AND

ANTI-VIRUS SOFTWARE.

THE COST OF THESE STEPS COULD REDUCE OUR OPERATING MARGINS. IF WE FAIL TO DO THESE THINGS WELL, ACTUAL OR

PERCEIVED SECURITY VULNERABILITIES IN OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION AND LEAD CUSTOMERS TO REDUCE OR DELAY FUTURE PURCHASES OF PRODUCTS OR SUBSCRIPTIONS TO SERVICES, OR TO USE COMPETING PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. CUSTOMERS MAY ALSO

SPEND MORE ON PROTECTING THEIR EXISTING COMPUTER SYSTEMS FROM ATTACK, WHICH COULD DELAY ADOPTION OF ADDITIONAL PRODUCTS OR SERVICES. CUSTOMERS MAY FAIL TO UPDATE THEIR SYSTEMS, CONTINUE TO RUN SOFTWARE OR OPERATING SYSTEMS WE NO LONGER SUPPORT, OR

MAY FAIL TIMELY TO INSTALL SECURITY PATCHES. ANY OF THESE ACTIONS BY CUSTOMERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. ACTUAL OR PERCEIVED VULNERABILITIES MAY LEAD TO CLAIMS AGAINST US. ALTHOUGH OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT

ELIMINATE OR LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO LIABILITY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THESE PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND LEGAL CHALLENGES. LEGISLATIVE OR REGULATORY ACTION IN THESE AREAS MAY INCREASE THE COSTS TO DEVELOP, IMPLEMENT OR SECURE OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

DISCLOSURE OF PERSONAL DATA COULD CAUSE LIABILITY AND HARM OUR REPUTATION.

AS WE CONTINUE TO GROW THE

NUMBER AND SCALE OF OUR CLOUD-BASED OFFERINGS, WE STORE AND PROCESS INCREASINGLY LARGE AMOUNTS OF PERSONALLY IDENTIFIABLE INFORMATION OF OUR CUSTOMERS. THE CONTINUED OCCURRENCE OF HIGH-PROFILE DATA BREACHES PROVIDES EVIDENCE OF AN EXTERNAL

ENVIRONMENT INCREASINGLY HOSTILE TO INFORMATION SECURITY. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO IMPROVE THE SECURITY CONTROLS ACROSS OUR BUSINESS GROUPS AND GEOGRAPHIES, IT IS POSSIBLE OUR SECURITY CONTROLS OVER PERSONAL DATA, OUR TRAINING OF EMPLOYEES AND VENDORS

ON DATA SECURITY, AND OTHER PRACTICES WE FOLLOW MAY NOT PREVENT THE IMPROPER DISCLOSURE OF CUSTOMER DATA WE OR OUR VENDORS STORE AND MANAGE. IMPROPER DISCLOSURE COULD HARM OUR REPUTATION, LEAD TO LEGAL EXPOSURE TO CUSTOMERS, OR SUBJECT US TO

LIABILITY UNDER LAWS THAT PROTECT PERSONAL DATA, RESULTING IN INCREASED COSTS OR LOSS OF REVENUE. OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES ALSO ENABLE OUR CUSTOMERS TO STORE AND PROCESS PERSONAL DATA ON-PREMISES OR, INCREASINGLY, IN A CLOUD-BASED

ENVIRONMENT WE HOST. LIKE ALL PROVIDERS OF COMMUNICATIONS SERVICES, GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES CAN SOMETIMES REQUIRE US TO PRODUCE CUSTOMER DATA IN RESPONSE TO VALID LEGAL ORDERS. IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE, WE ADVOCATE FOR TRANSPARENCY CONCERNING THESE

REQUESTS AND APPROPRIATE LIMITATIONS ON GOVERNMENT AUTHORITY TO COMPEL DISCLOSURE. DESPITE OUR EFFORTS TO PROTECT CUSTOMER DATA, PERCEPTIONS THAT THE PRIVACY OF PERSONAL INFORMATION IS NOT SATISFACTORILY PROTECTED COULD INHIBIT SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS

OR SERVICES, AND COULD LIMIT ADOPTION OF OUR CLOUD-BASED SOLUTIONS BY CONSUMERS, BUSINESSES, AND GOVERNMENT ENTITIES. ADDITIONAL SECURITY MEASURES WE MAY TAKE TO ADDRESS CUSTOMER CONCERNS, OR CONSTRAINTS ON OUR FLEXIBILITY TO DETERMINE WHERE AND HOW

TO OPERATE DATACENTERS IN RESPONSE TO CUSTOMER EXPECTATIONS OR GOVERNMENTAL RULES OR ACTIONS, MAY CAUSE HIGHER OPERATING EXPENSES.

WE MAY HAVE OUTAGES, DATA LOSSES, AND DISRUPTIONS OF OUR ONLINE SERVICES IF WE FAIL TO MAINTAIN AN ADEQUATE OPERATIONS

INFRASTRUCTURE.

OUR INCREASING USER TRAFFIC, GROWTH IN SERVICES AND THE COMPLEXITY OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES DEMAND MORE COMPUTING POWER. WE SPEND SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNTS TO BUILD, PURCHASE OR LEASE DATACENTERS AND

EQUIPMENT AND TO UPGRADE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND NETWORK INFRASTRUCTURE TO HANDLE MORE TRAFFIC ON OUR WEBSITES AND IN OUR DATACENTERS. THESE DEMANDS CONTINUE TO INCREASE AS WE INTRODUCE NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF EXISTING

SERVICES SUCH AS BING, EXCHANGE ONLINE, OFFICE 365, SHAREPOINT ONLINE, ONEDRIVE, SKYPE, XBOX LIVE, MICROSOFT AZURE, OUTLOOK.COM, MICROSOFT OFFICE WEB APPS, WINDOWS STORES AND MICROSOFT ACCOUNT SERVICES. WE ARE RAPIDLY GROWING OUR BUSINESS OF

PROVIDING A PLATFORM AND BACK-END HOSTING FOR SERVICES PROVIDED BY THIRD-PARTIES TO THEIR END USERS. MAINTAINING, SECURING AND EXPANDING THIS INFRASTRUCTURE IS EXPENSIVE AND COMPLEX. INEFFICIENCIES OR OPERATIONAL FAILURES, INCLUDING TEMPORARY OR

PERMANENT LOSS OF CUSTOMER DATA, COULD DIMINISH THE QUALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, SERVICES, AND USER EXPERIENCE RESULTING IN CONTRACTUAL LIABILITY, CLAIMS BY CUSTOMERS AND OTHER THIRD PARTIES, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION AND LOSS OF CURRENT AND POTENTIAL

USERS, SUBSCRIBERS, AND ADVERTISERS, EACH OF WHICH MAY HARM OUR OPERATING RESULTS AND FINANCIAL CONDITION.

GOVERNMENT LITIGATION AND REGULATORY ACTIVITY RELATING TO COMPETITION RULES MAY LIMIT HOW WE

DESIGN AND MARKET OUR PRODUCTS.

AS A LEADING GLOBAL SOFTWARE AND DEVICE MAKER, WE ARE CLOSELY SCRUTINIZED BY GOVERNMENT AGENCIES UNDER U.S. AND FOREIGN COMPETITION LAWS. AN INCREASING NUMBER OF GOVERNMENTS ARE REGULATING

COMPETITION LAW ACTIVITIES AND THIS INCLUDES INCREASED SCRUTINY IN POTENTIALLY LARGE MARKETS SUCH AS CHINA. SOME JURISDICTIONS ALSO ALLOW COMPETITORS OR CONSUMERS TO ASSERT CLAIMS OF ANTI-COMPETITIVE CONDUCT. U.S. FEDERAL AND STATE ANTITRUST

AUTHORITIES HAVE PREVIOUSLY BROUGHT ENFORCEMENT ACTIONS AND CONTINUE TO SCRUTINIZE OUR BUSINESS.

THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION CLOSELY

SCRUTINIZES THE DESIGN OF HIGH-VOLUME MICROSOFT PRODUCTS AND THE TERMS ON WHICH WE MAKE CERTAIN TECHNOLOGIES USED IN THESE PRODUCTS, SUCH AS FILE FORMATS, PROGRAMMING INTERFACES, AND PROTOCOLS, AVAILABLE TO OTHER COMPANIES. IN 2004, THE COMMISSION

ORDERED US TO CREATE NEW VERSIONS OF WINDOWS THAT DO NOT INCLUDE CERTAIN MULTIMEDIA TECHNOLOGIES AND TO PROVIDE OUR COMPETITORS WITH SPECIFICATIONS FOR HOW TO IMPLEMENT CERTAIN PROPRIETARY WINDOWS COMMUNICATIONS PROTOCOLS IN THEIR OWN PRODUCTS. IN

2009, THE COMMISSION ACCEPTED A SET OF COMMITMENTS OFFERED BY MICROSOFT TO ADDRESS THE COMMISSIONS CONCERNS RELATING TO COMPETITION IN WEB BROWSING SOFTWARE, INCLUDING AN UNDERTAKING TO ADDRESS COMMISSION CONCERNS RELATING TO INTEROPERABILITY.

THESE OBLIGATIONS MAY LIMIT OUR ABILITY TO INNOVATE IN WINDOWS OR OTHER PRODUCTS IN THE FUTURE, DIMINISH THE DEVELOPER APPEAL OF THE WINDOWS PLATFORM, AND INCREASE OUR PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT COSTS. THE AVAILABILITY OF LICENSES RELATED TO PROTOCOLS AND

FILE FORMATS MAY ENABLE COMPETITORS TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THAT BETTER MIMIC THE FUNCTIONALITY OF OUR PRODUCTS, WHICH COULD HAMPER SALES OF OUR PRODUCTS.

OUR PORTFOLIO OF FIRST-PARTY DEVICES CONTINUES TO GROW; AT THE SAME TIME OUR OEM PARTNERS OFFER A LARGE VARIETY OF DEVICES ON OUR PLATFORMS. AS A RESULT, INCREASINGLY WE BOTH COOPERATE AND COMPETE WITH OUR OEM

PARTNERS, CREATING A RISK THAT WE FAIL TO DO SO IN COMPLIANCE WITH COMPETITION RULES. REGULATORY SCRUTINY IN THIS AREA MAY INCREASE. CERTAIN FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS, PARTICULARLY IN CHINA AND OTHER COUNTRIES IN ASIA, HAVE ADVANCED ARGUMENTS UNDER THEIR

COMPETITION LAWS THAT EXERT DOWNWARD PRESSURE ON ROYALTIES FOR OUR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY. BECAUSE THESE JURISDICTIONS ONLY RECENTLY IMPLEMENTED COMPETITION LAWS, THEIR ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITIES ARE UNPREDICTABLE.

GOVERNMENT REGULATORY ACTIONS AND COURT DECISIONS SUCH AS THESE MAY HINDER OUR ABILITY TO PROVIDE THE BENEFITS OF OUR SOFTWARE TO CONSUMERS AND

BUSINESSES, REDUCING THE ATTRACTIVENESS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND THE REVENUE THAT COME FROM THEM. NEW COMPETITION LAW ACTIONS COULD BE INITIATED. THE OUTCOME OF SUCH ACTIONS, OR STEPS TAKEN TO AVOID THEM, COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT US IN A VARIETY OF WAYS,

INCLUDING.



WE MAY HAVE TO CHOOSE BETWEEN WITHDRAWING PRODUCTS FROM CERTAIN GEOGRAPHIES TO AVOID FINES OR DESIGNING AND DEVELOPING ALTERNATIVE VERSIONS OF THOSE PRODUCTS

TO COMPLY WITH GOVERNMENT RULINGS, WHICH MAY ENTAIL A DELAY IN A PRODUCT RELEASE AND REMOVING FUNCTIONALITY THAT CUSTOMERS WANT OR ON WHICH DEVELOPERS RELY.



WE MAY BE REQUIRED TO MAKE AVAILABLE LICENSES TO OUR PROPRIETARY TECHNOLOGIES ON TERMS THAT DO NOT REFLECT THEIR FAIR MARKET VALUE OR DO NOT PROTECT OUR

ASSOCIATED INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY.



THE RULINGS DESCRIBED ABOVE MAY BE PRECEDENT IN OTHER COMPETITION LAW PROCEEDINGS.



WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF ONGOING COMMITMENTS BECAUSE OF COURT OR ADMINISTRATIVE ORDERS, CONSENT DECREES OR OTHER VOLUNTARY ACTIONS WE HAVE TAKEN. IF WE

FAIL TO COMPLY WITH THESE COMMITMENTS WE MAY INCUR LITIGATION COSTS AND BE SUBJECT TO SUBSTANTIAL FINES OR OTHER REMEDIAL ACTIONS.

OUR INTERNATIONAL OPERATIONS SUBJECT US TO POTENTIAL LIABILITY UNDER ANTI-CORRUPTION, TRADE PROTECTION, AND OTHER LAWS AND REGULATIONS.

THE FOREIGN CORRUPT PRACTICES ACT AND OTHER

ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS AND REGULATIONS (ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS) PROHIBIT CORRUPT PAYMENTS BY OUR EMPLOYEES, VENDORS, OR AGENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, WE RECEIVE INQUIRIES FROM AUTHORITIES IN THE U.S. AND ELSEWHERE ABOUT OUR BUSINESS ACTIVITIES

OUTSIDE THE U.S. AND OUR COMPLIANCE WITH ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS. WHILE WE DEVOTE SUBSTANTIAL RESOURCES TO OUR GLOBAL COMPLIANCE PROGRAMS AND HAVE IMPLEMENTED POLICIES, TRAINING, AND INTERNAL CONTROLS DESIGNED TO REDUCE THE RISK OF CORRUPT PAYMENTS,

OUR EMPLOYEES, VENDORS, OR AGENTS MAY VIOLATE OUR POLICIES. OUR FAILURE TO COMPLY WITH ANTI-CORRUPTION LAWS COULD RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT FINES AND PENALTIES, CRIMINAL SANCTIONS AGAINST US, OUR OFFICERS OR OUR EMPLOYEES, PROHIBITIONS ON THE CONDUCT OF

OUR BUSINESS, AND DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION. OPERATIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. MAY BE AFFECTED BY CHANGES IN TRADE PROTECTION LAWS, POLICIES AND MEASURES, AND OTHER REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT. WE MAY BE SUBJECT TO LEGAL

LIABILITY AND REPUTATIONAL DAMAGE IF WE SELL GOODS OR SERVICES IN VIOLATION OF U.S. TRADE SANCTIONS ON COUNTRIES SUCH AS IRAN, NORTH KOREA, CUBA, SUDAN, AND SYRIA.

OTHER REGULATORY AREAS THAT MAY APPLY TO OUR PRODUCTS AND ONLINE SERVICES OFFERINGS INCLUDE USER

PRIVACY, TELECOMMUNICATIONS, DATA PROTECTION, AND ONLINE CONTENT. FOR EXAMPLE, REGULATORS MAY TAKE THE POSITION THAT OUR OFFERINGS SUCH AS SKYPE ARE COVERED BY LAWS REGULATING TELECOMMUNICATIONS SERVICES. APPLYING THESE LAWS AND REGULATIONS TO OUR

BUSINESS IS OFTEN UNCLEAR, SUBJECT TO CHANGE OVER TIME, AND SOMETIMES MAY CONFLICT FROM JURISDICTION TO JURISDICTION. ADDITIONALLY, THESE LAWS AND GOVERNMENTS APPROACH TO THEIR ENFORCEMENT, AND OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, ARE CONTINUING TO

EVOLVE. SOME GOVERNMENTS ARE EXPRESSING INCREASING CONCERN ABOUT GOVERNMENT SURVEILLANCE PRACTICES AROUND THE WORLD AND THIS MAY LEAD TO INCREASED REGULATION REQUIRING LOCAL HOSTING OBLIGATIONS OR THE USE OF DOMESTIC HOSTING PROVIDERS. COMPLIANCE

WITH THESE TYPES OF REGULATION MAY INVOLVE SIGNIFICANT COSTS OR REQUIRE CHANGES IN PRODUCTS OR BUSINESS PRACTICES THAT RESULT IN REDUCED REVENUE. NONCOMPLIANCE COULD RESULT IN THE IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES OR ORDERS WE STOP THE ALLEGED NONCOMPLIANT

ACTIVITY.

OUR BUSINESS DEPENDS ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN TALENTED EMPLOYEES.

OUR BUSINESS IS

BASED ON SUCCESSFULLY ATTRACTING AND RETAINING TALENTED EMPLOYEES. THE MARKET FOR HIGHLY SKILLED WORKERS AND LEADERS IN OUR INDUSTRY IS EXTREMELY COMPETITIVE. WE ARE LIMITED IN OUR ABILITY TO RECRUIT INTERNATIONALLY BY RESTRICTIVE DOMESTIC

IMMIGRATION LAWS. IF WE ARE LESS SUCCESSFUL IN OUR RECRUITING EFFORTS, OR IF WE CANNOT RETAIN KEY EMPLOYEES, INCLUDING KEY EMPLOYEES OF THE NDS BUSINESS ACQUIRED IN APRIL 2014, OUR ABILITY TO DEVELOP AND DELIVER SUCCESSFUL PRODUCTS AND SERVICES

MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. EFFECTIVE SUCCESSION PLANNING IS ALSO IMPORTANT TO OUR LONG-TERM SUCCESS. FAILURE TO ENSURE EFFECTIVE TRANSFER OF KNOWLEDGE AND SMOOTH TRANSITIONS INVOLVING KEY EMPLOYEES COULD HINDER OUR STRATEGIC PLANNING AND EXECUTION.

WE HAVE CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS AGAINST US THAT MAY RESULT IN ADVERSE OUTCOMES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY

OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS. ADVERSE OUTCOMES IN SOME OR ALL OF THESE CLAIMS MAY RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT MONETARY DAMAGES OR INJUNCTIVE RELIEF THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT OUR BUSINESS. THE LITIGATION AND OTHER CLAIMS ARE SUBJECT TO

INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE. A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS COULD OCCUR FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECT OF AN UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOME BECOMES

PROBABLE AND REASONABLY ESTIMABLE.

WE MAY HAVE ADDITIONAL TAX LIABILITIES.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAXES

IN THE U.S. AND MANY FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING OUR WORLDWIDE PROVISION FOR INCOME TAXES. IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS, THERE ARE MANY TRANSACTIONS AND CALCULATIONS WHERE THE ULTIMATE TAX

DETERMINATION IS UNCERTAIN. WE REGULARLY ARE UNDER AUDIT BY TAX AUTHORITIES. ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL PRESSURES TO INCREASE TAX REVENUES IN VARIOUS JURISDICTIONS MAY MAKE RESOLVING TAX DISPUTES MORE DIFFICULT. ALTHOUGH WE BELIEVE OUR TAX

ESTIMATES ARE REASONABLE, THE FINAL DETERMINATION OF TAX AUDITS AND ANY RELATED LITIGATION COULD BE MATERIALLY DIFFERENT FROM OUR HISTORICAL INCOME TAX PROVISIONS AND ACCRUALS. THE RESULTS OF AN AUDIT OR LITIGATION COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE PERIOD OR PERIODS FOR WHICH THAT DETERMINATION IS MADE.

WE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF

OUR OPERATING INCOME FROM OUTSIDE THE U.S., AND ANY REPATRIATION OF FUNDS CURRENTLY HELD IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS TO THE U.S. MAY RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES FOR THE COMPANY. IN ADDITION, THERE HAVE BEEN PROPOSALS FROM CONGRESS TO CHANGE

U.S. TAX LAWS THAT WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY IMPACT HOW U.S. MULTINATIONAL CORPORATIONS ARE TAXED ON FOREIGN EARNINGS. ALTHOUGH WE CANNOT PREDICT WHETHER OR IN WHAT FORM ANY PROPOSED LEGISLATION MAY PASS, IF ENACTED IT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT

ON OUR TAX EXPENSE AND CASH FLOWS.

OUR HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR SUPPLY

PROBLEMS.

OUR VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE PRODUCTS SUCH AS XBOX CONSOLES, SURFACE DEVICES, LUMIA SMARTPHONES, AND OTHER DEVICES WE DESIGN AND MARKET ARE HIGHLY COMPLEX AND CAN HAVE DEFECTS IN DESIGN, MANUFACTURE, OR

ASSOCIATED SOFTWARE. WE COULD INCUR SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES, LOST REVENUE, AND REPUTATIONAL HARM IF WE FAIL TO DETECT OR ADDRESS SUCH ISSUES THROUGH DESIGN, TESTING, OR WARRANTY REPAIRS. WE GET SOME DEVICE COMPONENTS FROM SOLE SUPPLIERS. OUR

COMPETITORS USE SOME OF THE SAME SUPPLIERS AND THEIR DEMAND FOR HARDWARE COMPONENTS CAN AFFECT THE CAPACITY AVAILABLE TO US. IF A COMPONENT FROM A SOLE-SOURCE SUPPLIER IS DELAYED OR BECOMES UNAVAILABLE, WHETHER BECAUSE OF SUPPLIER CAPACITY

CONSTRAINT OR INDUSTRY SHORTAGES, WE MAY NOT OBTAIN TIMELY REPLACEMENT SUPPLIES, RESULTING IN REDUCED SALES. COMPONENT SHORTAGES, EXCESS OR OBSOLETE INVENTORY, OR PRICE REDUCTIONS RESULTING IN INVENTORY ADJUSTMENTS MAY INCREASE OUR COST OF REVENUE.

XBOX CONSOLES AND SURFACE DEVICES AND LUMIA PHONES ARE ASSEMBLED IN ASIA AND OTHER GEOGRAPHIES THAT MAY BE SUBJECT TO DISRUPTIONS IN THE SUPPLY CHAIN, RESULTING IN SHORTAGES THAT WOULD AFFECT OUR REVENUE AND OPERATING MARGINS. THESE SAME RISKS WOULD

APPLY TO ANY OTHER VERTICALLY-INTEGRATED HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE MAY OFFER.

22

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART I

ITEM 1A

OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ALSO MAY EXPERIENCE QUALITY OR RELIABILITY PROBLEMS. THE HIGHLY

SOPHISTICATED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS WE DEVELOP MAY CONTAIN BUGS AND OTHER DEFECTS THAT INTERFERE WITH THEIR INTENDED OPERATION. ANY DEFECTS WE DO NOT DETECT AND FIX IN PRE-RELEASE TESTING COULD CAUSE REDUCED SALES AND REVENUE, DAMAGE TO OUR REPUTATION,

REPAIR OR REMEDIATION COSTS, DELAYS IN THE RELEASE OF NEW PRODUCTS OR VERSIONS, OR LEGAL LIABILITY. ALTHOUGH OUR LICENSE AGREEMENTS TYPICALLY CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT ELIMINATE OR LIMIT OUR EXPOSURE TO LIABILITY, THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THESE

PROVISIONS WILL WITHSTAND LEGAL CHALLENGE.

OUR GLOBAL BUSINESS EXPOSES US TO OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC

RISKS.

WE OPERATE IN OVER 100 COUNTRIES AND A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR REVENUE COMES FROM INTERNATIONAL SALES. THE GLOBAL NATURE OF OUR BUSINESS CREATES OPERATIONAL AND ECONOMIC RISKS. EMERGING MARKETS ARE A SIGNIFICANT

FOCUS OF OUR INTERNATIONAL GROWTH STRATEGY. THE DEVELOPING NATURE OF THESE MARKETS PRESENTS SEVERAL RISKS, INCLUDING DETERIORATION OF SOCIAL, POLITICAL, LABOR, OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN A COUNTRY OR REGION, AND DIFFICULTIES IN STAFFING AND MANAGING

FOREIGN OPERATIONS. ALTHOUGH WE HEDGE A PORTION OF OUR INTERNATIONAL CURRENCY EXPOSURE, SIGNIFICANT FLUCTUATIONS IN EXCHANGE RATES BETWEEN THE U.S. DOLLAR AND FOREIGN CURRENCIES MAY ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. COMPETITIVE OR REGULATORY PRESSURE TO

MAKE OUR PRICING STRUCTURE UNIFORM MIGHT REQUIRE THAT WE REDUCE THE SALES PRICE OF OUR SOFTWARE IN THE U.S. AND OTHER COUNTRIES.

CATASTROPHIC EVENTS OR GEO-POLITICAL CONDITIONS MAY DISRUPT OUR BUSINESS.

A DISRUPTION OR FAILURE OF OUR SYSTEMS OR

OPERATIONS BECAUSE OF A MAJOR EARTHQUAKE, WEATHER EVENT, CYBER-ATTACK, TERRORIST ATTACK, OR OTHER CATASTROPHIC EVENT COULD CAUSE DELAYS IN COMPLETING SALES, PROVIDING SERVICES, OR PERFORMING OTHER CRITICAL FUNCTIONS. OUR CORPORATE HEADQUARTERS, A

SIGNIFICANT PORTION OF OUR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES, AND CERTAIN OTHER ESSENTIAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS ARE IN THE SEATTLE, WASHINGTON AREA, AND WE HAVE OTHER BUSINESS OPERATIONS IN THE SILICON VALLEY AREA OF CALIFORNIA, BOTH OF WHICH ARE

NEAR MAJOR EARTHQUAKE FAULTS. A CATASTROPHIC EVENT THAT RESULTS IN THE DESTRUCTION OR DISRUPTION OF ANY OF OUR CRITICAL BUSINESS OR IT SYSTEMS COULD HARM OUR ABILITY TO CONDUCT NORMAL BUSINESS OPERATIONS. PROVIDING OUR CUSTOMERS WITH MORE SERVICES

AND SOLUTIONS IN THE CLOUD PUTS A PREMIUM ON THE RESILIENCE OF OUR SYSTEMS AND STRENGTH OF OUR BUSINESS CONTINUITY MANAGEMENT PLANS, AND MAGNIFIES THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF PROLONGED SERVICE OUTAGES ON OUR OPERATING RESULTS.

ABRUPT POLITICAL CHANGE, TERRORIST ACTIVITY, AND ARMED CONFLICT POSE A RISK OF GENERAL ECONOMIC DISRUPTION IN AFFECTED COUNTRIES, WHICH MAY

INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS. THESE CONDITIONS ALSO MAY ADD UNCERTAINTY TO THE TIMING AND BUDGET FOR TECHNOLOGY INVESTMENT DECISIONS BY OUR CUSTOMERS, AND MAY CAUSE SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS FOR HARDWARE MANUFACTURERS, EITHER OF WHICH MAY ADVERSELY

AFFECT OUR REVENUE. THE LONG-TERM EFFECTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE ON THE GLOBAL ECONOMY OR THE IT INDUSTRY IN PARTICULAR ARE UNCLEAR. ENVIRONMENTAL REGULATIONS OR CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY, DEMAND OR AVAILABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY MAY AFFECT THE AVAILABILITY OR

COST OF GOODS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING NATURAL RESOURCES, NECESSARY TO RUN OUR BUSINESS. CHANGES IN WEATHER WHERE WE OPERATE MAY INCREASE THE COSTS OF POWERING AND COOLING COMPUTER HARDWARE WE USE TO DEVELOP SOFTWARE AND PROVIDE CLOUD-BASED SERVICES.

ADVERSE ECONOMIC OR MARKET CONDITIONS MAY HARM OUR BUSINESS.

WORSENING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, INCLUDING

INFLATION, RECESSION, OR OTHER CHANGES IN ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, MAY CAUSE LOWER IT SPENDING AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUE. IF DEMAND FOR PCS, SERVERS, AND OTHER COMPUTING DEVICES DECLINES, OR CONSUMER OR BUSINESS SPENDING FOR THOSE PRODUCTS

DECLINES, OUR REVENUE WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. SUBSTANTIAL REVENUE COMES FROM OUR U.S. GOVERNMENT CONTRACTS. AN EXTENDED FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SHUTDOWN RESULTING FROM FAILING TO PASS BUDGET APPROPRIATIONS, ADOPT CONTINUING FUNDING RESOLUTIONS OR

RAISE THE DEBT CEILING, AND OTHER BUDGETARY DECISIONS LIMITING OR DELAYING FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDING, COULD REDUCE GOVERNMENT IT SPENDING ON OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES AND ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR REVENUES. OUR PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION SYSTEM ALSO RELIES

ON AN EXTENSIVE PARTNER AND RETAIL NETWORK. OEMS BUILDING DEVICES THAT RUN OUR SOFTWARE HAVE ALSO BEEN A SIGNIFICANT MEANS OF DISTRIBUTION. THE IMPACT OF ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ON OUR PARTNERS, SUCH AS THE BANKRUPTCY OF A MAJOR DISTRIBUTOR, OEM, OR

RETAILER, COULD CAUSE SALES CHANNEL DISRUPTION. CHALLENGING ECONOMIC CONDITIONS ALSO MAY IMPAIR THE ABILITY OF OUR CUSTOMERS TO PAY FOR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THEY HAVE PURCHASED. AS A RESULT, ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS AND WRITE-OFFS OF

ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE MAY INCREASE. WE MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO OF VARIOUS HOLDINGS, TYPES, AND MATURITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO GENERAL CREDIT, LIQUIDITY, MARKET, AND INTEREST RATE RISKS, WHICH MAY BE EXACERBATED BY UNUSUAL EVENTS

THAT AFFECT GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS. A SIGNIFICANT PART OF OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO COMPRISES U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. IF GLOBAL CREDIT AND EQUITY MARKETS DECLINE FOR LONG PERIODS, OR IF THERE IS A DOWNGRADE OF THE U.S. GOVERNMENT CREDIT RATING

DUE TO AN ACTUAL OR THREATENED DEFAULT ON GOVERNMENT DEBT, OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED AND WE COULD DETERMINE THAT MORE OF OUR INVESTMENTS HAVE EXPERIENCED AN OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE, REQUIRING IMPAIRMENT

CHARGES THAT COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT OUR FINANCIAL RESULTS.

ITEM 7. MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

THE FOLLOWING MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) IS INTENDED TO HELP THE READER UNDERSTAND THE RESULTS OF OPERATIONS

AND FINANCIAL CONDITION OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION. MD&A IS PROVIDED AS A SUPPLEMENT TO, AND SHOULD BE READ IN CONJUNCTION WITH, OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND THE ACCOMPANYING NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

OVERVIEW

MICROSOFT IS A

TECHNOLOGY LEADER FOCUSED ON BEING THE PRODUCTIVITY AND PLATFORM COMPANY FOR THE MOBILE-FIRST AND CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. WE STRIVE TO REINVENT PRODUCTIVITY TO EMPOWER PEOPLE AND ORGANIZATIONS TO DO MORE AND ACHIEVE MORE. WE CREATE TECHNOLOGY THAT

TRANSFORMS THE WAY PEOPLE WORK, PLAY, AND COMMUNICATE ACROSS A WIDE RANGE OF COMPUTING DEVICES.

WE GENERATE REVENUE BY DEVELOPING,

LICENSING, AND SUPPORTING A WIDE RANGE OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, BY OFFERING AN ARRAY OF SERVICES, INCLUDING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES, BY DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING, AND SELLING DEVICES THAT INTEGRATE WITH OUR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES,

AND BY DELIVERING RELEVANT ONLINE ADVERTISING TO A GLOBAL AUDIENCE. OUR MOST SIGNIFICANT EXPENSES ARE RELATED TO COMPENSATING EMPLOYEES, DESIGNING, MANUFACTURING, MARKETING, AND SELLING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, DATACENTER COSTS IN SUPPORT OF OUR

CLOUD-BASED SERVICES, AND INCOME TAXES.

INDUSTRY TRENDS

OUR INDUSTRY IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE, WITH FREQUENT CHANGES IN BOTH TECHNOLOGIES AND BUSINESS MODELS. EACH INDUSTRY SHIFT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO CONCEIVE NEW PRODUCTS, NEW TECHNOLOGIES, OR NEW IDEAS THAT

CAN FURTHER TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRY AND OUR BUSINESS. AT MICROSOFT, WE PUSH THE BOUNDARIES OF WHAT IS POSSIBLE THROUGH A BROAD RANGE OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES THAT SEEK TO IDENTIFY AND ADDRESS THE CHANGING DEMANDS OF CUSTOMERS, INDUSTRY

TRENDS, AND COMPETITIVE FORCES.

KEY OPPORTUNITIES AND INVESTMENTS

WE SEE SIGNIFICANT OPPORTUNITIES FOR GROWTH BY INVESTING RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT RESOURCES IN THE FOLLOWING AREAS.

DIGITAL WORK AND LIFE EXPERIENCES



OUR CLOUD OPERATING SYSTEM



OUR DEVICES OPERATING SYSTEM AND HARDWARE

ITEM 7

WITH INVESTMENTS IN THESE AREAS, WE WORK TO FULFILL THE EVOLVING NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS IN A

MOBILE-FIRST AND CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. WE VIEW MOBILITY BROADLY  NOT JUST BY DEVICES, BUT BY EXPERIENCES. TODAY, PEOPLE MOVE JUST AS QUICKLY INTO NEW CONTEXTS AS TO NEW LOCATIONS. MOBILITY GOES BEYOND DEVICES USERS CARRY WITH THEM AS THEY MOVE

FROM PLACE TO PLACE, TO ENCOMPASS THE RICH COLLECTION OF DATA, APPLICATIONS, AND SERVICES THAT ACCOMPANY THEM AS THEY MOVE FROM SETTING TO SETTING IN THEIR LIVES. MANY OF OUR CUSTOMERS ARE DUAL USERS, EMPLOYING TECHNOLOGY FOR WORK OR

SCHOOL AND ALSO DEEPLY IN THEIR PERSONAL LIVES.

DIGITAL WORK AND LIFE EXPERIENCES

WE BELIEVE WE CAN SIGNIFICANTLY ENHANCE THE DIGITAL LIVES OF OUR CUSTOMERS USING OUR BROAD PORTFOLIO OF COMMUNICATION, PRODUCTIVITY, AND

INFORMATION SERVICES. WE WORK TO DELIVER DIGITAL WORK AND LIFE EXPERIENCES THAT ARE REINVENTED FOR THE MOBILE-FIRST AND CLOUD-FIRST WORLD. PRODUCTIVITY WILL BE THE FIRST AND FOREMOST OBJECTIVE, TO ENABLE PEOPLE TO MEET AND COLLABORATE MORE EASILY,

AND TO EFFECTIVELY EXPRESS IDEAS IN NEW WAYS. WE WILL DESIGN APPLICATIONS AS DUAL USE WITH THE INTELLIGENCE TO PARTITION DATA BETWEEN WORK AND LIFE WHILE RESPECTING EACH PERSONS PRIVACY CHOICES. THE FOUNDATION FOR THESE EFFORTS WILL REST ON

ADVANCING OUR LEADING PRODUCTIVITY, COLLABORATION, AND BUSINESS PROCESS TOOLS INCLUDING SKYPE, ONEDRIVE, ONENOTE, OUTLOOK, WORD, EXCEL, POWERPOINT, BING, AND DYNAMICS.

WE SEE OPPORTUNITY IN COMBINING THESE SERVICES IN NEW WAYS THAT ARE MORE CONTEXTUAL AND PERSONAL, WHILE ENSURING PEOPLE, RATHER THAN THEIR DEVICES, REMAIN AT THE CENTER OF THE DIGITAL EXPERIENCE. WE WILL OFFER OUR

SERVICES ACROSS ECOSYSTEMS AND DEVICES OUTSIDE OUR OWN. AS PEOPLE MOVE FROM DEVICE TO DEVICE, SO WILL THEIR CONTENT AND THE RICHNESS OF THEIR SERVICES. WE WILL ENGINEER APPLICATIONS SO USERS CAN FIND, TRY, AND BUY THEM IN FRICTION-FREE WAYS.

CLOUD OPERATING SYSTEM

TODAY,

BUSINESSES FACE IMPORTANT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES. ENTERPRISES ARE ASKED TO DEPLOY TECHNOLOGY THAT ADVANCES BUSINESS STRATEGY. THEY DECIDE WHAT SOLUTIONS WILL MAKE EMPLOYEES MORE PRODUCTIVE, COLLABORATIVE, AND SATISFIED, OR CONNECT WITH

CUSTOMERS IN NEW AND COMPELLING WAYS. THEY WORK TO UNLOCK BUSINESS INSIGHTS FROM A WORLD OF DATA. THEY RELY ON OUR TECHNOLOGY TO MANAGE EMPLOYEE CORPORATE IDENTITY, AND TO MANAGE AND SECURE CORPORATE INFORMATION ACCESSED AND STORED ACROSS A GROWING

NUMBER OF DEVICES. TO ACHIEVE THESE OBJECTIVES INCREASINGLY BUSINESSES LOOK TO LEVERAGE THE BENEFITS OF THE CLOUD. HELPING BUSINESSES MOVE TO THE CLOUD IS ONE OF OUR LARGEST OPPORTUNITIES, AND WE BELIEVE WE WORK FROM A POSITION OF STRENGTH.

THE SHIFT TO THE CLOUD IS DRIVEN BY THREE IMPORTANT ECONOMIES OF SCALE: LARGER DATACENTERS CAN DEPLOY COMPUTATIONAL RESOURCES AT

SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER COST PER UNIT THAN SMALLER ONES; LARGER DATACENTERS CAN COORDINATE AND AGGREGATE DIVERSE CUSTOMER, GEOGRAPHIC, AND APPLICATION DEMAND PATTERNS IMPROVING THE UTILIZATION OF COMPUTING, STORAGE, AND NETWORK RESOURCES; AND

MULTI-TENANCY LOWERS APPLICATION MAINTENANCE LABOR COSTS FOR LARGE PUBLIC CLOUDS. THE CLOUD CREATES THE OPPORTUNITY FOR BUSINESSES TO FOCUS ON INNOVATION WHILE LEAVING NON-DIFFERENTIATING ACTIVITIES TO RELIABLE AND COST-EFFECTIVE PROVIDERS.

WITH AZURE, WE ARE ONE OF VERY FEW CLOUD VENDORS THAT RUN AT A SCALE THAT MEETS THE NEEDS OF BUSINESSES OF ALL SIZES AND COMPLEXITIES.

WE BELIEVE THE COMBINATION OF AZURE AND WINDOWS SERVER MAKES US THE ONLY COMPANY WITH A PUBLIC, PRIVATE, AND HYBRID CLOUD PLATFORM THAT CAN POWER MODERN BUSINESS. WE ARE WORKING TO ENHANCE THE RETURN ON IT INVESTMENT BY ENABLING ENTERPRISES TO

COMBINE THEIR EXISTING DATACENTERS AND OUR PUBLIC CLOUD INTO A SINGLE COHESIVE INFRASTRUCTURE. BUSINESSES CAN DEPLOY APPLICATIONS IN THEIR OWN DATACENTER, A PARTNERS DATACENTER, OR IN OUR DATACENTERS WITH COMMON SECURITY, MANAGEMENT, AND

ADMINISTRATION ACROSS ALL ENVIRONMENTS, WITH THE FLEXIBILITY AND SCALE THEY DESIRE.

OUR CLOUD WILL ALSO ENABLE RICHER EMPLOYEE

EXPERIENCES. WE ENABLE ORGANIZATIONS TO SECURELY ADOPT SOFTWARE-AS-A-SERVICE APPLICATIONS (BOTH OUR OWN AND THIRD-PARTY) AND INTEGRATE THEM WITH THEIR EXISTING SECURITY AND MANAGEMENT INFRASTRUCTURE. WE WILL CONTINUE TO INNOVATE WITH HIGHER LEVEL

SERVICES INCLUDING IDENTITY AND DIRECTORY SERVICES, RICH DATA STORAGE AND ANALYTICS SERVICES, MACHINE LEARNING SERVICES, MEDIA SERVICES, WEB, AND MOBILE BACKEND SERVICES, AND DEVELOPER PRODUCTIVITY SERVICES. TO FOSTER A RICH DEVELOPER ECOSYSTEM, OUR

DIGITAL WORK

27

ITEM 7

AND LIFE EXPERIENCES WILL ALSO BE EXTENSIBLE, ENABLING CUSTOMERS AND PARTNERS TO FURTHER CUSTOMIZE AND ENHANCE OUR SOLUTIONS, ACHIEVING EVEN MORE VALUE. OUR STRATEGY REQUIRES CONTINUING

INVESTMENT IN DATACENTERS AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE TO SUPPORT OUR DEVICES AND SERVICES, AND WILL BRING CONTINUED COMPETITION WITH GOOGLE, AMAZON, AND OTHER WELL-ESTABLISHED AND EMERGING COMPETITORS.

DEVICE OPERATING SYSTEM AND HARDWARE

WITH

OUR WINDOWS DEVICE OPERATING SYSTEM AND FIRST-PARTY HARDWARE, WE STRIVE TO SET THE STANDARD FOR PRODUCTIVITY EXPERIENCES. WE AIM TO DELIVER THE RICHEST AND MOST CONSISTENT USER EXPERIENCE FOR DIGITAL WORK AND LIFE SCENARIOS ON SCREENS OF ALL SIZES

 FROM PHONES, TABLETS, AND LAPTOPS TO TVS AND LARGE, MULTI-TOUCH DISPLAYS. WE ARE INVESTING TO MAKE WINDOWS THE MOST SECURE, MANAGEABLE, AND CAPABLE OPERATING SYSTEM FOR THE NEEDS OF A MODERN WORKFORCE. WE ARE WORKING TO CREATE A BROAD

DEVELOPER OPPORTUNITY BY ENABLING UNIVERSAL WINDOWS APPLICATIONS TO RUN ACROSS ALL DEVICE TARGETS. WE ARE DEVELOPING NEW INPUT/OUTPUT METHODS LIKE SPEECH, PEN, AND GESTURE TO POWER MORE PERSONAL COMPUTING EXPERIENCES.

WE WORK WITH AN ECOSYSTEM OF PARTNERS TO DELIVER A BROAD SPECTRUM OF WINDOWS DEVICES. WE ALSO BUILD FIRST-PARTY HARDWARE TO SET THE STANDARD FOR

PRODUCTIVITY EXPERIENCES AND STIMULATE MORE DEMAND FOR THE ENTIRE WINDOWS ECOSYSTEM, AS WE DO WITH SURFACE, AND WITH THE ACQUISITION OF SUBSTANTIALLY ALL NOKIA CORPORATIONS (NOKIA) DEVICES AND SERVICES BUSINESS (NDS) ON

APRIL 25, 2014, PHONES. AS CONSUMER SERVICES AND HARDWARE ADVANCE, WE EXPECT THEY WILL CONTINUE TO BETTER COMPLEMENT ONE ANOTHER, CONNECTING THE DEVICES PEOPLE USE DAILY TO UNIQUE COMMUNICATIONS, PRODUCTIVITY, AND ENTERTAINMENT SERVICES FROM

MICROSOFT AND OUR PARTNERS AND DEVELOPERS. WE ANTICIPATE MANY NEW MOBILE DEVICE CATEGORIES AND WE ANTICIPATE EXPERIENCES TO EMERGE THAT SPAN A VARIETY OF DEVICES OF ALL SCREEN SIZES. WE WILL INVEST TO BE ON THE FOREFRONT OF THIS INNOVATION FOCUSING

ON DUAL USERS AND THEIR NEEDS ACROSS WORK AND LIFE. WITH THE ACQUISITION OF NDS, WE EXPECT OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE TO INCREASE AS OUR BUSINESS MIX CHANGES.

OUR FUTURE OPPORTUNITY

THERE ARE SEVERAL DISTINCT AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY THAT WE AIM TO DRIVE

FORWARD. OUR GOAL IS TO LEAD THE INDUSTRY IN THESE AREAS OVER THE LONG TERM, WHICH WE EXPECT WILL TRANSLATE TO SUSTAINED GROWTH. WE ARE INVESTING SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES IN.



DELIVERING NEW HIGH-VALUE DIGITAL WORK AND DIGITAL LIFE EXPERIENCES TO IMPROVE HOW PEOPLE LEARN, WORK, PLAY, AND INTERACT WITH ONE ANOTHER.



ESTABLISHING OUR WINDOWS PLATFORM ACROSS THE PC, TABLET, PHONE, SERVER, OTHER DEVICES, AND THE CLOUD TO DRIVE A THRIVING ECOSYSTEM OF DEVELOPERS, UNIFY THE

CROSS-DEVICE USER EXPERIENCE, AND INCREASE AGILITY WHEN BRINGING NEW ADVANCES TO MARKET.



BUILDING AND RUNNING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES IN WAYS THAT UNLEASH NEW EXPERIENCES AND OPPORTUNITIES FOR BUSINESSES AND INDIVIDUALS.



DEVELOPING NEW DEVICES THAT HAVE INCREASINGLY NATURAL WAYS TO USE THEM, INCLUDING TOUCH, GESTURE, AND SPEECH.



APPLYING MACHINE LEARNING TO MAKE TECHNOLOGY MORE INTUITIVE AND ABLE TO ACT ON OUR BEHALF, INSTEAD OF AT OUR COMMAND.

WE BELIEVE THE BREADTH OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES PORTFOLIO, OUR LARGE, GLOBAL PARTNER AND CUSTOMER BASE, OUR GROWING ECOSYSTEM, AND OUR ONGOING

INVESTMENT IN INNOVATION POSITION US TO BE A LEADER IN THESE AREAS.

ECONOMIC CONDITIONS, CHALLENGES, AND RISKS

THE MARKET FOR SOFTWARE, DEVICES, AND CLOUD-BASED SERVICES IS DYNAMIC AND HIGHLY COMPETITIVE. OUR COMPETITORS ARE DEVELOPING NEW SOFTWARE AND

DEVICES, WHILE ALSO DEPLOYING COMPETING CLOUD-BASED SERVICES FOR CONSUMERS AND BUSINESSES. THE DEVICES AND FORM FACTORS CUSTOMERS PREFER EVOLVE RAPIDLY, AND INFLUENCE HOW USERS ACCESS SERVICES IN THE CLOUD AND IN SOME CASES THE USERS CHOICE OF

WHICH SUITE OF CLOUD-BASED SERVICES TO USE. WE MUST CONTINUE TO EVOLVE AND ADAPT OVER AN EXTENDED TIME IN PACE WITH THIS CHANGING ENVIRONMENT. TO SUPPORT OUR STRATEGY OF

ITEM 7

REINVENTING PRODUCTIVITY TO EMPOWER EVERY PERSON AND EVERY ORGANIZATION TO DO MORE AND ACHIEVE MORE, WE ANNOUNCED A RESTRUCTURING PLAN IN JULY 2014. THROUGH THIS RESTRUCTURING, WE STRIVE TO

INCREASE AGILITY, STREAMLINE ENGINEERING PROCESSES, MOVE FASTER AND MORE EFFICIENTLY, AND SIMPLIFY OUR ORGANIZATION. EVEN IF WE ACHIEVE THESE GOALS, THE INVESTMENTS WE ARE MAKING IN DEVICES AND INFRASTRUCTURE WILL INCREASE OUR OPERATING COSTS AND

MAY DECREASE OUR OPERATING MARGINS.

WE PRIORITIZE OUR INVESTMENTS AMONG THE HIGHEST LONG-TERM GROWTH OPPORTUNITIES. THESE INVESTMENTS

REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT RESOURCES AND ARE MULTI-YEAR IN NATURE. THE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES WE BRING TO MARKET MAY BE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY, AS PART OF A PARTNERSHIP OR ALLIANCE, OR THROUGH ACQUISITION.

OUR SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON OUR ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. WE HIRE A MIX OF UNIVERSITY AND INDUSTRY TALENT

WORLDWIDE. MICROSOFT COMPETES FOR TALENTED INDIVIDUALS GLOBALLY BY OFFERING AN EXCEPTIONAL WORKING ENVIRONMENT, BROAD CUSTOMER REACH, SCALE IN RESOURCES, THE ABILITY TO GROW ONES CAREER ACROSS MANY DIFFERENT PRODUCTS AND BUSINESSES, AND

COMPETITIVE COMPENSATION AND BENEFITS. AGGREGATE DEMAND FOR OUR SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES IS CORRELATED TO GLOBAL MACROECONOMIC AND GEOPOLITICAL FACTORS, WHICH REMAIN DYNAMIC. SEE A DISCUSSION OF THESE FACTORS AND OTHER RISKS UNDER RISK

FACTORS (PART I, ITEM 1A OF THIS FORM 10-K).

UNEARNED REVENUE

QUARTERLY AND ANNUAL REVENUE MAY BE IMPACTED BY THE DEFERRAL OF REVENUE. SEE THE DISCUSSIONS BELOW REGARDING.



REVENUE DEFERRED ON CERTAIN DEVICES BUNDLED WITH OTHER PRODUCTS AND SERVICES (BUNDLED OFFERINGS); AND



REVENUE DEFERRED ON SALES OF WINDOWS 7 WITH AN OPTION TO UPGRADE TO WINDOWS 8 PRO AT A DISCOUNTED PRICE (THE WINDOWS UPGRADE OFFER).

IF OUR CUSTOMERS CHOOSE TO LICENSE CLOUD-BASED VERSIONS OF OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES RATHER THAN LICENSING

TRANSACTION-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, THE ASSOCIATED REVENUE WILL SHIFT FROM BEING RECOGNIZED AT THE TIME OF THE TRANSACTION TO BEING RECOGNIZED OVER THE SUBSCRIPTION PERIOD OR UPON CONSUMPTION, AS APPLICABLE.

REPORTABLE SEGMENTS

THE SEGMENT AMOUNTS

INCLUDED IN MD&A ARE PRESENTED ON A BASIS CONSISTENT WITH OUR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING. SEGMENT INFORMATION APPEARING IN NOTE 21  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (PART II, ITEM 8 OF

THIS FORM 10-K) IS ALSO PRESENTED ON THIS BASIS. ALL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN OUR INTERNAL MANAGEMENT REPORTING BASIS AND ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE U.S. (U.S. GAAP), ALONG WITH CERTAIN CORPORATE-LEVEL AND OTHER ACTIVITY,

ARE INCLUDED IN CORPORATE AND OTHER. OPERATING EXPENSES ARE NOT ALLOCATED TO OUR SEGMENTS.

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR

2014, WE CHANGED OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AS PART OF OUR TRANSFORMATION TO A DEVICES AND SERVICES COMPANY. AS A RESULT, INFORMATION THAT OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION MAKER REGULARLY REVIEWS FOR PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING RESOURCES AND ASSESSING

PERFORMANCE CHANGED. THEREFORE, WE HAVE RECAST CERTAIN PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE WAY WE INTERNALLY MANAGED AND MONITORED SEGMENT PERFORMANCE DURING FISCAL YEAR 2014. OUR REPORTABLE SEGMENTS ARE DESCRIBED BELOW.

ON APRIL 25, 2014, WE ACQUIRED SUBSTANTIALLY ALL OF NDS FOR TOTAL CONSIDERATION OF $9.5 BILLION. THIS AMOUNT WAS GREATER THAN THE $7.2 BILLION

DISCLOSED PREVIOUSLY, PRIMARILY DUE TO $1.5 BILLION OF CASH ACQUIRED, FOREIGN CURRENCY MOVEMENTS OF $330 MILLION, WORKING CAPITAL ADJUSTMENTS OF $210 MILLION, AND OTHER ADJUSTMENTS OF $260 MILLION. SEE NOTE 9  BUSINESS COMBINATIONS OF THE

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR ADDITIONAL DETAILS. NDS HAS BEEN INCLUDED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS STARTING ON THE ACQUISITION DATE. WE REPORT THE FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE OF THE ACQUIRED BUSINESS IN OUR NEW PHONE HARDWARE SEGMENT.

PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION OF NDS, FINANCIAL RESULTS ASSOCIATED WITH OUR JOINT STRATEGIC INITIATIVES WITH NOKIA WERE REFLECTED IN OUR D&C LICENSING SEGMENT. THE CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WITH NOKIA RELATED TO THOSE INITIATIVES TERMINATED IN

CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACQUISITION. WITH THE CREATION OF THE NEW PHONE HARDWARE SEGMENT, THE D&C HARDWARE SEGMENT WAS RENAMED COMPUTING AND GAMING HARDWARE IN THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2014.

INCOME TAXES

FISCAL YEAR 2014 COMPARED

WITH FISCAL YEAR 2013

OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEARS 2014 AND 2013 WAS APPROXIMATELY 21% AND 19%, RESPECTIVELY. OUR

EFFECTIVE TAX RATE WAS LOWER THAN THE U.S. FEDERAL STATUTORY RATE PRIMARILY DUE TO EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS RESULTING FROM PRODUCING AND DISTRIBUTING OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS

CENTERS IN IRELAND, SINGAPORE, AND PUERTO RICO.

OUR FISCAL YEAR 2014 EFFECTIVE RATE INCREASED BY 2% FROM FISCAL YEAR 2013 MAINLY DUE TO

ADJUSTMENTS OF $458 MILLION TO PRIOR YEARS LIABILITIES FOR INTERCOMPANY TRANSFER PRICING THAT INCREASED TAXABLE INCOME IN MORE HIGHLY TAXED JURISDICTIONS, AS WELL AS LOSSES INCURRED BY NDS AND CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC MIX OF OUR BUSINESS.

THIS WAS OFFSET IN PART BY FAVORABLE TRANSFER PRICING DEVELOPMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS, PRIMARILY DENMARK.

CHANGES IN

THE MIX OF INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES BETWEEN THE U.S. AND FOREIGN COUNTRIES ALSO IMPACTED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATES AND RESULTED PRIMARILY FROM CHANGES IN THE GEOGRAPHIC DISTRIBUTION OF AND CHANGES IN CONSUMER DEMAND FOR OUR PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE

SUPPLY OUR WINDOWS PC OPERATING SYSTEM TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR U.S. REGIONAL OPERATING CENTER, WHILE WE SUPPLY THE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND OUR SERVER PRODUCTS AND TOOLS TO CUSTOMERS THROUGH OUR FOREIGN REGIONAL OPERATIONS CENTERS. WINDOWS PC

OPERATING SYSTEM REVENUE DECREASED $655 MILLION IN FISCAL YEAR 2014, WHILE MICROSOFT OFFICE SYSTEM AND SERVER PRODUCTS AND TOOLS REVENUE INCREASED $1.3 BILLION AND $1.6 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, DURING THIS SAME PERIOD. IN FISCAL YEARS 2014 AND 2013,

OUR U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $7.1 BILLION AND $6.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 26% AND 25%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2014 AND 2013, THE FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $20.7 BILLION

AND $20.4 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 74% AND 75%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES.

TAX CONTINGENCIES AND

OTHER TAX LIABILITIES WERE $10.4 BILLION AND $9.4 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2014 AND 2013, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THIS INCREASE RELATES PRIMARILY TO ADJUSTMENTS TO PRIOR YEARS LIABILITIES FOR

INTERCOMPANY TRANSFER PRICING AND ADJUSTMENTS RELATED TO OUR IRS AUDITS. WHILE WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S. AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REMAIN UNDER AUDIT FOR THOSE YEARS. IN FEBRUARY 2012,

THE I.R.S. WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS REPORT AND REOPENED THE AUDIT PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A PROPOSED ASSESSMENT FOR THE UNRESOLVED ISSUES AND DO NOT EXPECT A FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, WE DO

NOT ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX CONTINGENCIES FOR THESE ISSUES. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2013.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR OPERATIONS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR TAX

YEARS 1996 TO 2013, SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES. THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE AUDITS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RICO.

OUR FISCAL YEAR 2013 EFFECTIVE RATE DECREASED BY 5% FROM FISCAL YEAR 2012 MAINLY DUE TO A NONRECURRING $6.2 BILLION NON-TAX

DEDUCTIBLE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE THAT WAS RECORDED IN FISCAL YEAR 2012. THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE INCREASED OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE BY 10% IN FISCAL YEAR 2012. IN ADDITION, IN FISCAL YEARS 2013 AND 2012, WE RECOGNIZED A REDUCTION OF 18% AND

21%, RESPECTIVELY, TO THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE DUE TO FOREIGN EARNINGS TAXED AT LOWER RATES. THE DECREASE IN OUR EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL YEAR 2013 WAS PRIMARILY OFFSET BY A 1% INCREASE RELATED TO THE EU FINE, WHICH IS NOT TAX DEDUCTIBLE.

RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. IN FISCAL YEARS 2013 AND 2012, THE FOREIGN INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES WAS $20.4 BILLION AND $20.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, AND COMPRISED 75% AND 93%, RESPECTIVELY, OF OUR INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAXES. THE

PRIMARY DRIVER FOR THE INCREASE IN THE U.S. INCOME BEFORE INCOME TAX IN FISCAL YEAR 2013 WAS THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE RECORDED DURING THE PRIOR YEAR.

TAX CONTINGENCIES AND OTHER TAX LIABILITIES WERE $9.4 BILLION AND $7.6 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013 AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY, AND ARE INCLUDED IN OTHER LONG-TERM LIABILITIES. THIS INCREASE RELATES PRIMARILY TO

TRANSFER PRICING, INCLUDING TRANSFER PRICING DEVELOPMENTS IN CERTAIN FOREIGN TAX JURISDICTIONS, PRIMARILY DENMARK. WHILE WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S. AUDIT FOR TAX YEARS 2004 TO 2006 DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REMAIN

UNDER AUDIT FOR THOSE YEARS. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE I.R.S. WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS REPORT AND REOPENED THE AUDIT PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING WHICH COULD HAVE A

SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS REASONABLY POSSIBLE THAT THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE OR DECREASE WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS

BECAUSE WE DO NOT BELIEVE THE REMAINING OPEN ISSUES WILL BE RESOLVED WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2012.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR OPERATIONS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR TAX

YEARS 1996 TO 2012, SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES. THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE AUDITS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

CASH, CASH

EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS

CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOTALED $85.7 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2014,

COMPARED WITH $77.0 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013. EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS WERE $14.6 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, COMPARED WITH $10.8 BILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2013. OUR SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE PRIMARILY TO FACILITATE LIQUIDITY

AND FOR CAPITAL PRESERVATION. THEY CONSIST PREDOMINANTLY OF HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. THE INVESTMENTS ARE PREDOMINANTLY U.S. DOLLAR-DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO

INCLUDE FOREIGN CURRENCY-DENOMINATED SECURITIES IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY RISK. OUR FIXED-INCOME INVESTMENTS ARE EXPOSED TO INTEREST RATE RISK AND CREDIT RISK. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE

MANAGED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME INDICES. THE SETTLEMENT RISK RELATED TO THESE INVESTMENTS IS INSIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT THE SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD

ARE PRIMARILY HIGHLY LIQUID INVESTMENT-GRADE FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES.

OF THE CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS AT

JUNE 30, 2014, $77.1 BILLION WAS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES AND WOULD BE SUBJECT TO MATERIAL REPATRIATION TAX EFFECTS. THE AMOUNT OF CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES SUBJECT TO OTHER

RESTRICTIONS ON THE FREE FLOW OF FUNDS (PRIMARILY CURRENCY AND OTHER LOCAL REGULATORY) WAS $2.6 BILLION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, APPROXIMATELY 84% OF THE CASH EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS HELD BY OUR FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES WERE INVESTED IN

U.S. GOVERNMENT AND AGENCY SECURITIES, APPROXIMATELY 5% WERE INVESTED IN CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS OF U.S. COMPANIES, AND APPROXIMATELY 1% WERE INVESTED IN U.S. MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, ALL OF WHICH ARE DENOMINATED IN U.S. DOLLARS.

SECURITIES LENDING

WE LEND CERTAIN

FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT

DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY. OUR SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCE WAS $558 MILLION AS OF JUNE 30, 2014. OUR

AVERAGE AND MAXIMUM SECURITIES LENDING PAYABLE BALANCES FOR THE FISCAL YEAR WERE $619 MILLION AND $1.3 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. INTRA-YEAR VARIANCES IN THE AMOUNT OF SECURITIES LOANED ARE MAINLY DUE TO FLUCTUATIONS IN THE DEMAND FOR THE SECURITIES.

VALUATION

IN GENERAL, AND

WHERE APPLICABLE, WE USE QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 1 INVESTMENTS, SUCH AS EXCHANGE-TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS,

DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES. IF QUOTED PRICES IN ACTIVE MARKETS FOR IDENTICAL ASSETS OR LIABILITIES ARE NOT AVAILABLE TO DETERMINE FAIR VALUE, THEN WE USE QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR ASSETS AND LIABILITIES OR

INPUTS OTHER THAN THE QUOTED PRICES THAT ARE OBSERVABLE EITHER DIRECTLY OR INDIRECTLY. THIS PRICING METHODOLOGY APPLIES TO OUR LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS SUCH AS CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK, FOREIGN GOVERNMENT BONDS,

MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, AND CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT. LEVEL 3 INVESTMENTS ARE VALUED USING INTERNALLY DEVELOPED MODELS WITH UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS. ASSETS AND LIABILITIES MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE ON A RECURRING BASIS USING UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS ARE AN

IMMATERIAL PORTION OF OUR PORTFOLIO.

A MAJORITY OF OUR INVESTMENTS ARE PRICED BY PRICING VENDORS AND ARE GENERALLY LEVEL 1 OR LEVEL 2

INVESTMENTS AS THESE VENDORS EITHER PROVIDE A QUOTED MARKET PRICE IN AN ACTIVE MARKET OR USE OBSERVABLE INPUTS FOR THEIR PRICING WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. BROKER PRICING IS USED MAINLY WHEN A QUOTED PRICE IS NOT AVAILABLE, THE

INVESTMENT IS NOT PRICED BY OUR PRICING VENDORS, OR WHEN A BROKER PRICE IS MORE REFLECTIVE OF FAIR VALUES IN THE MARKET IN WHICH THE INVESTMENT TRADES. OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY CLASSIFIED AS LEVEL 2 INVESTMENTS BECAUSE THE BROKER

PRICES THESE INVESTMENTS BASED ON SIMILAR ASSETS WITHOUT APPLYING SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS. IN ADDITION, ALL OF OUR BROKER-PRICED INVESTMENTS HAVE A SUFFICIENT LEVEL OF TRADING VOLUME TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FAIR VALUES USED ARE APPROPRIATE FOR THESE

INVESTMENTS. OUR FAIR VALUE PROCESSES INCLUDE CONTROLS THAT ARE DESIGNED TO ENSURE APPROPRIATE FAIR VALUES ARE RECORDED. THESE CONTROLS INCLUDE MODEL VALIDATION, REVIEW OF KEY MODEL INPUTS, ANALYSIS OF PERIOD-OVER-PERIOD FLUCTUATIONS, AND

INDEPENDENT RECALCULATION OF PRICES WHERE APPROPRIATE.

CASH FLOWS

FISCAL YEAR 2014 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2013

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS INCREASED $3.4

BILLION DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TO $32.2 BILLION, DUE MAINLY TO INCREASES IN CASH RECEIVED FROM CUSTOMERS. CASH USED IN FINANCING INCREASED $246 MILLION TO $8.4 BILLION, DUE MAINLY TO A $2.0 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR COMMON STOCK

REPURCHASES, A $1.4 BILLION INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS PAID, AND A $324 MILLION DECREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK, OFFSET IN PART BY A $3.4 BILLION INCREASE IN

PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF DEBT, NET OF REPAYMENTS. CASH USED IN INVESTING DECREASED $5.0 BILLION TO $18.8 BILLION, DUE MAINLY TO A $10.5 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR NET INVESTMENT

PURCHASES, SALES, AND MATURITIES, OFFSET IN PART BY A $4.4 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR ACQUISITION OF COMPANIES AND PURCHASES OF INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS, AND A $1.2 BILLION INCREASE IN CAPITAL EXPENDITURES FOR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.

FISCAL YEAR 2013 COMPARED WITH FISCAL YEAR 2012

CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS DECREASED $2.8 BILLION DURING THE CURRENT FISCAL YEAR TO $28.8 BILLION, DUE MAINLY TO CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, INCLUDING INCREASES IN INVENTORY AND OTHER CURRENT ASSETS. CASH USED FOR

FINANCING DECREASED $1.3 BILLION TO $8.1 BILLION, DUE MAINLY TO A $3.5 BILLION INCREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM ISSUANCES OF DEBT, NET OF REPAYMENTS, OFFSET IN PART BY A $1.1 BILLION INCREASE IN DIVIDENDS PAID AND A $982 MILLION DECREASE IN PROCEEDS FROM

THE ISSUANCE OF COMMON STOCK. CASH USED IN INVESTING DECREASED $975 MILLION TO $23.8 BILLION, DUE MAINLY TO AN $8.5 BILLION DECREASE IN CASH USED FOR ACQUISITIONS OF COMPANIES AND PURCHASES OF INTANGIBLE AND OTHER ASSETS, OFFSET IN PART BY A $5.8

BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR NET INVESTMENT PURCHASES, MATURITIES, AND SALES, AND A $2.0 BILLION INCREASE IN CASH USED FOR ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT.

DEBT

WE ISSUED DEBT TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF FAVORABLE PRICING AND LIQUIDITY IN THE DEBT MARKETS,

REFLECTING OUR CREDIT RATING AND THE LOW INTEREST RATE ENVIRONMENT. THE PROCEEDS OF THESE ISSUANCES WERE OR WILL BE USED FOR GENERAL CORPORATE PURPOSES, WHICH MAY INCLUDE, AMONG OTHER THINGS, FUNDING FOR WORKING CAPITAL, CAPITAL EXPENDITURES,

REPURCHASES OF CAPITAL STOCK, ACQUISITIONS, AND REPAYMENT OF EXISTING DEBT.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, WE HAD $22.6 BILLION OF ISSUED

AND OUTSTANDING DEBT, COMPRISING $2.0 BILLION OF SHORT-TERM DEBT AND $20.6 BILLION OF LONG-TERM DEBT.

SHORT-TERM DEBT

AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, WE HAD $2.0 BILLION OF COMMERCIAL PAPER ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING, WITH A WEIGHTED-AVERAGE INTEREST RATE OF 0.12% AND

MATURITIES RANGING FROM 86 DAYS TO 91 DAYS. THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THIS COMMERCIAL PAPER APPROXIMATES ITS CARRYING VALUE.

WE HAVE

A $5.0 BILLION CREDIT FACILITY THAT EXPIRES ON NOVEMBER 14, 2018, WHICH SERVES AS A BACK-UP FOR OUR COMMERCIAL PAPER PROGRAM. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, WE WERE IN COMPLIANCE WITH THE ONLY FINANCIAL COVENANT IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT, WHICH

REQUIRES US TO MAINTAIN A COVERAGE RATIO OF AT LEAST THREE TIMES EARNINGS BEFORE INTEREST, TAXES, DEPRECIATION, AND AMORTIZATION TO INTEREST EXPENSE, AS DEFINED IN THE CREDIT AGREEMENT. NO AMOUNTS WERE DRAWN AGAINST THE CREDIT FACILITY DURING ANY OF

THE PERIODS PRESENTED.

LONG-TERM DEBT

AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE TOTAL CARRYING VALUE AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF OUR LONG-TERM DEBT WERE $20.6 BILLION AND $21.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUES ARE BASED ON LEVEL 2 INPUTS.

OTHER PLANNED USES OF CAPITAL

WE WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES, MARKETING, PRODUCT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE, AND EXISTING AND ADVANCED AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY. ADDITIONS TO

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WILL CONTINUE, INCLUDING NEW FACILITIES, DATA CENTERS, AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, SALES AND MARKETING, SUPPORT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. WE EXPECT CAPITAL EXPENDITURES TO INCREASE IN COMING YEARS IN

SUPPORT OF OUR CLOUD AND DEVICES STRATEGY. WE HAVE OPERATING LEASES FOR MOST U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL SALES AND SUPPORT OFFICES AND CERTAIN EQUIPMENT. WE HAVE NOT ENGAGED IN ANY RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES

OR OTHER PERSONS THAT ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY AFFECT LIQUIDITY OR THE AVAILABILITY OF CAPITAL RESOURCES.

LIQUIDITY

WE EARN A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF OUR OPERATING INCOME OUTSIDE THE U.S., WHICH IS DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY REINVESTED IN FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS. AS A

RESULT, AS DISCUSSED ABOVE UNDER CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND INVESTMENTS, THE MAJORITY OF OUR CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE HELD BY FOREIGN SUBSIDIARIES. WE CURRENTLY DO NOT INTEND NOR FORESEE A NEED TO REPATRIATE THESE

FUNDS. WE EXPECT EXISTING DOMESTIC CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR DOMESTIC OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING AND FINANCING ACTIVITIES,

SUCH AS REGULAR QUARTERLY DIVIDENDS, DEBT REPAYMENT SCHEDULES, AND MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE. IN ADDITION, WE EXPECT EXISTING FOREIGN CASH, CASH EQUIVALENTS, SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS, AND CASH FLOWS FROM OPERATIONS TO CONTINUE TO BE SUFFICIENT TO FUND OUR FOREIGN OPERATING ACTIVITIES AND CASH COMMITMENTS FOR INVESTING ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS MATERIAL CAPITAL EXPENDITURES, FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 12 MONTHS AND THEREAFTER

FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.

SHOULD WE REQUIRE MORE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THAN IS GENERATED BY OUR OPERATIONS DOMESTICALLY, FOR EXAMPLE TO

FUND SIGNIFICANT DISCRETIONARY ACTIVITIES, SUCH AS BUSINESS ACQUISITIONS AND SHARE REPURCHASES, WE COULD ELECT TO REPATRIATE FUTURE EARNINGS FROM FOREIGN JURISDICTIONS OR RAISE CAPITAL IN THE U.S. THROUGH DEBT OR EQUITY ISSUANCES. THESE ALTERNATIVES

COULD RESULT IN HIGHER EFFECTIVE TAX RATES, INCREASED INTEREST EXPENSE, OR DILUTION OF OUR EARNINGS. WE HAVE BORROWED FUNDS DOMESTICALLY AND CONTINUE TO BELIEVE WE HAVE THE ABILITY TO DO SO AT REASONABLE INTEREST RATES.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE ENHANCING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE NATURE OF AN ENTITYS RIGHT TO OFFSET AND RELATED ARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF THE GROSS

AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO RIGHTS OF SET-OFF, AMOUNTS OFFSET IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOLLOWED, AND THE RELATED NET EXPOSURE. IN JANUARY 2013, THE FASB CLARIFIED THAT THE SCOPE OF THIS GUIDANCE APPLIES TO DERIVATIVES, REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS, AND SECURITIES LENDING ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE EITHER OFFSET OR SUBJECT TO AN ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT, OR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS. WE ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE RESULTED

ONLY IN CHANGES TO THE PRESENTATION OF NOTE 5  DERIVATIVES OF THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE FASB

ISSUED GUIDANCE ON DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS FOR ITEMS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF AOCI. THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES ENTITIES TO PRESENT (EITHER ON THE FACE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT OR IN THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) THE EFFECTS ON THE LINE ITEMS OF THE

INCOME STATEMENT FOR AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF AOCI. WE ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE RESULTED ONLY IN CHANGES TO THE PRESENTATION OF NOTE 19  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME OF

THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE NOT YET ADOPTED

IN MARCH 2013, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON A PARENTS ACCOUNTING FOR THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT UPON DERECOGNITION OF A SUBSIDIARY

OR GROUP OF ASSETS WITHIN A FOREIGN ENTITY. THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT THE PARENT RELEASE ANY RELATED CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT INTO NET INCOME ONLY IF THE SALE OR TRANSFER RESULTS IN THE COMPLETE OR SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE LIQUIDATION

OF THE FOREIGN ENTITY IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OR GROUP OF ASSETS HAD RESIDED. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2014. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.

IN MAY 2014, AS PART OF ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO ASSIST IN THE CONVERGENCE OF U.S. GAAP AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS,

THE FASB ISSUED A NEW STANDARD RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION. UNDER THE NEW STANDARD, RECOGNITION OF REVENUE OCCURS WHEN A CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY

EXPECTS TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE STANDARD REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING, AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE

EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2017 AND EARLY ADOPTION IS NOT PERMITTED. WE ANTICIPATE THIS STANDARD WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, AND WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING ITS IMPACT.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH U.S. GAAP. PREPARING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT

THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENTS APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR US INCLUDE REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF

INVESTMENT SECURITIES, GOODWILL, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, CONTINGENCIES, INCOME TAXES, AND INVENTORIES.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE IF MULTIPLE ELEMENTS EXIST, WHETHER ELEMENTS CAN BE ACCOUNTED

FOR AS SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING, AND IF SO, THE FAIR VALUE FOR EACH OF THE ELEMENTS.

JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS WHETHER

FUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS. CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR

CURRENT PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH RIGHTS TO RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS (SOFTWARE ASSURANCE) AND ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED

AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD.

SOFTWARE UPDATES ARE EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS

TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, WHICH MAY REQUIRE REVENUE TO BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED WHEN THE UPGRADE IS DELIVERED. IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED POST-CONTRACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT (PCS) IS BEING PROVIDED,

REVENUE FROM THE ARRANGEMENT IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE IMPLIED PCS TERM. IF UPDATES ARE DETERMINED TO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE.

MICROSOFT ENTERS INTO ARRANGEMENTS THAT CAN INCLUDE VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND HARDWARE. WHERE ELEMENTS ARE DELIVERED OVER

DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME, AND WHEN ALLOWED UNDER U.S. GAAP, REVENUE IS ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT, AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EACH ELEMENT IS DELIVERED. WE USE A

HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING REVENUE TO ELEMENTS: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (VSOE), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE, AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE

(ESP). FOR SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, WE FOLLOW THE INDUSTRY SPECIFIC SOFTWARE GUIDANCE WHICH ONLY ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF VSOE IN ESTABLISHING FAIR VALUE. GENERALLY, VSOE IS THE PRICE CHARGED WHEN THE DELIVERABLE IS SOLD SEPARATELY OR THE PRICE

ESTABLISHED BY MANAGEMENT FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS NOT YET SOLD IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRICE WILL NOT CHANGE BEFORE INTRODUCTION INTO THE MARKETPLACE. ESPS ARE ESTABLISHED AS BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES WOULD BE IF THE DELIVERABLES

WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. OUR PROCESS FOR DETERMINING ESPS REQUIRES JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE.

WINDOWS 7 REVENUE WAS SUBJECT TO DEFERRAL AS A RESULT OF THE WINDOWS UPGRADE OFFER, WHICH STARTED JUNE 2, 2012. THE OFFER PROVIDED

SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED RIGHTS TO PURCHASE WINDOWS 8 PRO TO QUALIFYING END-USERS THAT PURCHASED WINDOWS 7 PCS DURING THE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD. MICROSOFT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR DELIVERING WINDOWS 8 PRO TO THE END CUSTOMER. ACCORDINGLY, REVENUE RELATED TO

THE ALLOCATED DISCOUNT FOR UNDELIVERED WINDOWS 8 WAS DEFERRED UNTIL IT WAS DELIVERED OR THE REDEMPTION PERIOD EXPIRED.

IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT

SECURITIES

WE REVIEW INVESTMENTS QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. THIS DETERMINATION REQUIRES

SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY QUARTERLY THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS

ITS FAIR VALUE, WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR

PLANS TO SELL, THE INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE

CONDITIONS RELATED TO THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IF MARKET, INDUSTRY, AND/OR INVESTEE CONDITIONS DETERIORATE, WE MAY INCUR FUTURE IMPAIRMENTS.

GOODWILL

WE ALLOCATE GOODWILL TO REPORTING

UNITS BASED ON THE REPORTING UNIT EXPECTED TO BENEFIT FROM THE BUSINESS COMBINATION. WE EVALUATE OUR REPORTING UNITS ON AN ANNUAL BASIS AND, IF NECESSARY, REASSIGN GOODWILL USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE ALLOCATION APPROACH. GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR

VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE. THESE EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES COULD INCLUDE A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE BUSINESS CLIMATE, LEGAL FACTORS, OPERATING PERFORMANCE INDICATORS, COMPETITION, OR SALE OR DISPOSITION OF A SIGNIFICANT

PORTION OF A REPORTING UNIT.

47

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 7

APPLICATION OF THE GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT TEST REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING THE IDENTIFICATION OF

REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES TO REPORTING UNITS, ASSIGNMENT OF GOODWILL TO REPORTING UNITS, AND DETERMINATION OF THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT. THE FAIR VALUE OF EACH REPORTING UNIT IS ESTIMATED PRIMARILY THROUGH THE

USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY. THIS ANALYSIS REQUIRES SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENTS, INCLUDING ESTIMATION OF FUTURE CASH FLOWS, WHICH IS DEPENDENT ON INTERNAL FORECASTS, ESTIMATION OF THE LONG-TERM RATE OF GROWTH FOR OUR BUSINESS, ESTIMATION OF

THE USEFUL LIFE OVER WHICH CASH FLOWS WILL OCCUR, AND DETERMINATION OF OUR WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL.

THE ESTIMATES USED TO

CALCULATE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT CHANGE FROM YEAR TO YEAR BASED ON OPERATING RESULTS, MARKET CONDITIONS, AND OTHER FACTORS. CHANGES IN THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS COULD MATERIALLY AFFECT THE DETERMINATION OF FAIR VALUE AND GOODWILL

IMPAIRMENT FOR EACH REPORTING UNIT.

THE VALUATION OF ACQUIRED ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, INCLUDING GOODWILL, RESULTING FROM THE

ACQUISITION OF NDS, IS REFLECTIVE OF THE ENTERPRISE VALUE BASED ON THE LONG-TERM FINANCIAL FORECAST FOR THE BUSINESS. IN THIS HIGHLY COMPETITIVE AND VOLATILE MARKET, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT WE MAY NOT REALIZE OUR FORECASTS. GIVEN THE VALUE ASSIGNED

TO GOODWILL IN THE PURCHASE PRICE ALLOCATION, WE WILL CLOSELY MONITOR THE PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS VERSUS THE LONG-TERM FORECAST TO DETERMINE IF ANY IMPAIRMENTS ARISE.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS

COSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN RESEARCHING AND DEVELOPING A

COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT ARE CHARGED TO EXPENSE UNTIL TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED, ALL SOFTWARE COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL

RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN DETERMINING WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. WE HAVE DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED AFTER ALL HIGH-RISK DEVELOPMENT ISSUES HAVE

BEEN RESOLVED THROUGH CODING AND TESTING. GENERALLY, THIS OCCURS SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. THE AMORTIZATION OF THESE COSTS IS INCLUDED IN COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE PRODUCTS.

LEGAL AND OTHER CONTINGENCIES

THE OUTCOMES

OF LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS BROUGHT AGAINST US ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY SUCH AS A LEGAL PROCEEDING OR CLAIM IS ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN

IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. IN DETERMINING WHETHER A LOSS SHOULD BE ACCRUED WE EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY

TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INCOME

TAXES

THE OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR

AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. WE RECOGNIZE THE TAX BENEFIT FROM AN UNCERTAIN TAX POSITION ONLY IF IT IS MORE

LIKELY THAN NOT THAT THE TAX POSITION WILL BE SUSTAINED ON EXAMINATION BY THE TAXING AUTHORITIES, BASED ON THE TECHNICAL MERITS OF THE POSITION. THE TAX BENEFITS RECOGNIZED IN THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FROM SUCH A POSITION ARE MEASURED BASED ON THE

LARGEST BENEFIT THAT HAS A GREATER THAN 50% LIKELIHOOD OF BEING REALIZED UPON ULTIMATE SETTLEMENT. ACCOUNTING LITERATURE ALSO PROVIDES GUIDANCE ON DERECOGNITION OF INCOME TAX ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, CLASSIFICATION OF CURRENT AND DEFERRED INCOME TAX

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR INTEREST AND PENALTIES ASSOCIATED WITH TAX POSITIONS, AND INCOME TAX DISCLOSURES. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. VARIATIONS IN THE ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST, SUBJECT TO THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET.

COST INCLUDES MATERIALS, LABOR, AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD RELATED TO THE PURCHASE AND PRODUCTION OF INVENTORIES. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVENTORY

ITEM 7

QUANTITIES ON HAND, FUTURE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, AND THE ESTIMATED UTILITY OF OUR INVENTORY. THESE REVIEWS INCLUDE ANALYSIS OF DEMAND FORECASTS, PRODUCT LIFE CYCLE STATUS,

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT PLANS, CURRENT SALES LEVELS, PRICING STRATEGY, AND COMPONENT COST TRENDS. IF OUR REVIEW INDICATES A REDUCTION IN UTILITY BELOW CARRYING VALUE, WE REDUCE OUR INVENTORY TO A NEW COST BASIS THROUGH A CHARGE TO COST OF REVENUE. THE

DETERMINATION OF MARKET VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED VOLUME OF DEMAND USED IN THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET ANALYSIS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT.

STATEMENT OF MANAGEMENTS RESPONSIBILITY FOR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE PREPARATION OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND RELATED INFORMATION THAT ARE PRESENTED IN THIS REPORT.

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, WHICH INCLUDE AMOUNTS BASED ON MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND JUDGMENTS, HAVE BEEN PREPARED IN CONFORMITY WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

THE COMPANY DESIGNS AND MAINTAINS ACCOUNTING AND INTERNAL CONTROL SYSTEMS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE AT REASONABLE COST THAT ASSETS ARE

SAFEGUARDED AGAINST LOSS FROM UNAUTHORIZED USE OR DISPOSITION, AND THAT THE FINANCIAL RECORDS ARE RELIABLE FOR PREPARING CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND MAINTAINING ACCOUNTABILITY FOR ASSETS. THESE SYSTEMS ARE AUGMENTED BY WRITTEN POLICIES, AN

ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE PROVIDING DIVISION OF RESPONSIBILITIES, CAREFUL SELECTION AND TRAINING OF QUALIFIED PERSONNEL, AND A PROGRAM OF INTERNAL AUDITS.

THE COMPANY ENGAGED DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP, AN INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM, TO AUDIT AND RENDER AN OPINION ON THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL

REPORTING IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES).

THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS,

ITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT

MARKET RISK

RISKS

WE ARE EXPOSED TO ECONOMIC RISK FROM FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, CREDIT RISK, EQUITY PRICES, AND COMMODITY PRICES. A PORTION OF THESE RISKS IS HEDGED, BUT THEY MAY IMPACT OUR CONSOLIDATED

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY AND USE HEDGES WHERE PRACTICABLE TO OFFSET THE RISKS AND MAXIMIZE THE

ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR.

INTEREST RATE

OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO

IS DIVERSIFIED ACROSS CREDIT SECTORS AND MATURITIES, CONSISTING PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. THE CREDIT RISK AND AVERAGE MATURITY OF THE FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS MANAGED TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL AND

DOMESTIC FIXED-INCOME INDICES. IN ADDITION, WE USE TO BE ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO AGENCY AND MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES.

EQUITY

OUR EQUITY PORTFOLIO CONSISTS OF

GLOBAL, DEVELOPED, AND EMERGING MARKET SECURITIES THAT ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. WE MANAGE THE SECURITIES RELATIVE TO CERTAIN GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC INDICES AND EXPECT THEIR ECONOMIC RISK AND RETURN TO CORRELATE WITH THESE INDICES.

COMMODITY

WE USE BROAD-BASED

COMMODITY EXPOSURES TO ENHANCE PORTFOLIO RETURNS AND FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. OUR INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO HAS EXPOSURE TO A VARIETY OF COMMODITIES, INCLUDING PRECIOUS METALS, ENERGY, AND GRAIN. WE MANAGE THESE EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO GLOBAL

COMMODITY INDICES AND EXPECT THEIR ECONOMIC RISK AND RETURN TO CORRELATE WITH THESE INDICES.

VALUE-AT-RISK

WE USE A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE AND QUANTIFY OUR MARKET RISKS. VAR IS THE EXPECTED LOSS, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE LEVEL,

IN THE FAIR VALUE OF OUR PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE, INCLUDING DETERMINATIONS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE IN

ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES (U.S. GAAP), BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE DISTRIBUTION OF THE POTENTIAL CHANGES IN TOTAL MARKET VALUE OF ALL HOLDINGS IS COMPUTED

BASED ON THE HISTORICAL VOLATILITIES AND CORRELATIONS AMONG FOREIGN CURRENCY EXCHANGE RATES, INTEREST RATES, EQUITY PRICES, AND COMMODITY PRICES, ASSUMING NORMAL MARKET CONDITIONS.

THE VAR IS CALCULATED AS THE TOTAL LOSS THAT WILL NOT BE EXCEEDED AT THE 97.5 PERCENTILE CONFIDENCE LEVEL OR, ALTERNATIVELY STATED, THE LOSSES

COULD EXCEED THE VAR IN 25 OUT OF 1,000 CASES. SEVERAL RISK FACTORS ARE NOT CAPTURED IN THE MODEL, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, AND LEGAL RISK.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1  ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED

STATES OF AMERICA (U.S. GAAP).

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES. INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. EQUITY INVESTMENTS THROUGH WHICH WE ARE ABLE TO

EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER BUT DO NOT CONTROL THE INVESTEE AND ARE NOT THE PRIMARY BENEFICIARY OF THE INVESTEES ACTIVITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD. INVESTMENTS THROUGH WHICH WE ARE NOT ABLE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT

INFLUENCE OVER THE INVESTEE AND WHICH DO NOT HAVE READILY DETERMINABLE FAIR VALUES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR UNDER THE COST METHOD.

ESTIMATES AND

ASSUMPTIONS

PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS

OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. EXAMPLES OF ESTIMATES INCLUDE: LOSS CONTINGENCIES; PRODUCT WARRANTIES; THE FAIR VALUE OF, AND/OR POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR, OUR REPORTING UNITS; PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES; USEFUL LIVES OF OUR TANGIBLE

AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS; ALLOWANCES FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS; ALLOWANCES FOR PRODUCT RETURNS; THE MARKET VALUE OF OUR INVENTORY; AND STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION FORFEITURE RATES. EXAMPLES OF ASSUMPTIONS INCLUDE: THE ELEMENTS COMPRISING A SOFTWARE

ARRANGEMENT, INCLUDING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN UPGRADES OR ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW PRODUCTS; WHEN TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ACHIEVED FOR OUR PRODUCTS; THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN OUR

CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS; AND DETERMINING WHEN INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ACTUAL RESULTS AND OUTCOMES MAY DIFFER FROM MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

RECASTING OF CERTAIN PRIOR PERIOD INFORMATION

DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2014, WE CHANGED OUR ORGANIZATIONAL STRUCTURE AS PART OF OUR TRANSFORMATION TO A DEVICES AND SERVICES COMPANY. AS A RESULT, INFORMATION THAT OUR CHIEF OPERATING DECISION

MAKER REGULARLY REVIEWS FOR PURPOSES OF ALLOCATING RESOURCES AND ASSESSING PERFORMANCE CHANGED. THEREFORE, BEGINNING IN FISCAL YEAR 2014, WE REPORTED OUR FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE BASED ON OUR NEW SEGMENTS DESCRIBED IN NOTE 21  SEGMENT INFORMATION

AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA. WE HAVE RECAST CERTAIN PRIOR PERIOD AMOUNTS TO CONFORM TO THE WAY WE INTERNALLY MANAGED AND MONITORED SEGMENT PERFORMANCE DURING FISCAL YEAR 2014. THIS CHANGE IMPACTED NOTE 10  GOODWILL, NOTE 14  UNEARNED REVENUE,

AND NOTE 21  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA, WITH NO IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES ARE TRANSLATED AT THE EXCHANGE RATE ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. REVENUE AND

EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING DURING THE YEAR. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM THIS PROCESS ARE RECORDED TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI).

REVENUE RECOGNITION

REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED

WHEN PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN ARRANGEMENT EXISTS, DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED, THE FEE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE, AND COLLECTABILITY IS PROBABLE. REVENUE GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED NET OF ALLOWANCES FOR RETURNS AND ANY TAXES COLLECTED FROM CUSTOMERS AND

SUBSEQUENTLY REMITTED TO GOVERNMENTAL AUTHORITIES.

ITEM 8

REVENUE RECOGNITION FOR MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS REQUIRES JUDGMENT TO DETERMINE IF MULTIPLE

ELEMENTS EXIST, WHETHER ELEMENTS CAN BE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SEPARATE UNITS OF ACCOUNTING, AND IF SO, THE FAIR VALUE FOR EACH OF THE ELEMENTS.

MICROSOFT ENTERS INTO ARRANGEMENTS THAT CAN INCLUDE VARIOUS COMBINATIONS OF SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND HARDWARE. WHERE ELEMENTS ARE DELIVERED OVER DIFFERENT PERIODS OF TIME, AND WHEN ALLOWED UNDER U.S. GAAP, REVENUE

IS ALLOCATED TO THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS BASED ON THEIR RELATIVE SELLING PRICES AT THE INCEPTION OF THE ARRANGEMENT, AND REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS EACH ELEMENT IS DELIVERED. WE USE A HIERARCHY TO DETERMINE THE FAIR VALUE TO BE USED FOR ALLOCATING

REVENUE TO ELEMENTS: (I) VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE OF FAIR VALUE (VSOE), (II) THIRD-PARTY EVIDENCE, AND (III) BEST ESTIMATE OF SELLING PRICE (ESP). FOR SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, WE FOLLOW THE INDUSTRY

SPECIFIC SOFTWARE GUIDANCE WHICH ONLY ALLOWS FOR THE USE OF VSOE IN ESTABLISHING FAIR VALUE. GENERALLY, VSOE IS THE PRICE CHARGED WHEN THE DELIVERABLE IS SOLD SEPARATELY OR THE PRICE ESTABLISHED BY MANAGEMENT FOR A PRODUCT THAT IS NOT YET SOLD IF IT

IS PROBABLE THAT THE PRICE WILL NOT CHANGE BEFORE INTRODUCTION INTO THE MARKETPLACE. ESPS ARE ESTABLISHED AS BEST ESTIMATES OF WHAT THE SELLING PRICES WOULD BE IF THE DELIVERABLES WERE SOLD REGULARLY ON A STAND-ALONE BASIS. OUR PROCESS FOR

DETERMINING ESPS REQUIRES JUDGMENT AND CONSIDERS MULTIPLE FACTORS THAT MAY VARY OVER TIME DEPENDING UPON THE UNIQUE FACTS AND CIRCUMSTANCES RELATED TO EACH DELIVERABLE.

REVENUE FOR RETAIL PACKAGED PRODUCTS, PRODUCTS LICENSED TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS), AND PERPETUAL LICENSES UNDER CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS GENERALLY IS RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE

SHIPPED OR MADE AVAILABLE.

TECHNOLOGY GUARANTEE PROGRAMS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS AS CUSTOMERS RECEIVE FREE

OR SIGNIFICANTLY DISCOUNTED RIGHTS TO USE UPCOMING NEW VERSIONS OF A SOFTWARE PRODUCT IF THEY LICENSE EXISTING VERSIONS OF THE PRODUCT DURING THE ELIGIBILITY PERIOD. REVENUE IS ALLOCATED BETWEEN THE EXISTING PRODUCT AND THE NEW PRODUCT, AND REVENUE

ALLOCATED TO THE NEW PRODUCT IS DEFERRED UNTIL THAT VERSION IS DELIVERED. THE REVENUE ALLOCATION IS BASED ON THE VSOE OF FAIR VALUE OF THE PRODUCTS. THE VSOE OF FAIR VALUE FOR UPCOMING NEW PRODUCTS ARE BASED ON THE PRICE DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT

HAVING THE RELEVANT AUTHORITY WHEN THE ELEMENT IS NOT YET SOLD SEPARATELY, BUT IS EXPECTED TO BE SOLD IN THE NEAR FUTURE AT THE PRICE SET BY MANAGEMENT.

SOFTWARE UPDATES THAT WILL BE PROVIDED FREE OF CHARGE ARE EVALUATED ON A CASE-BY-CASE BASIS TO DETERMINE WHETHER THEY MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE AND CREATE A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT, WHICH MAY REQUIRE

REVENUE TO BE DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED WHEN THE UPGRADE IS DELIVERED, OR IF IT IS DETERMINED THAT IMPLIED POST-CONTRACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT (PCS) IS BEING PROVIDED, THE ARRANGEMENT IS ACCOUNTED FOR AS A MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENT AND ALL

REVENUE FROM THE ARRANGEMENT IS DEFERRED AND RECOGNIZED OVER THE IMPLIED PCS TERM WHEN THE VSOE OF FAIR VALUE DOES NOT EXIST. IF UPDATES ARE DETERMINED TO NOT MEET THE DEFINITION OF AN UPGRADE, REVENUE IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED AS PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED

OR MADE AVAILABLE.

CERTAIN VOLUME LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE A PERPETUAL LICENSE FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS COMBINED WITH RIGHTS TO

RECEIVE UNSPECIFIED FUTURE VERSIONS OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS (SOFTWARE ASSURANCE), WHICH WE HAVE DETERMINED ARE ADDITIONAL SOFTWARE PRODUCTS AND ARE THEREFORE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND

RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD. ARRANGEMENTS THAT INCLUDE TERM-BASED LICENSES FOR CURRENT PRODUCTS WITH THE RIGHT TO USE UNSPECIFIED FUTURE VERSIONS OF THE SOFTWARE DURING THE COVERAGE PERIOD, ARE ALSO ACCOUNTED FOR AS

SUBSCRIPTIONS, WITH REVENUE RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE COVERAGE PERIOD.

REVENUE FROM CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS THAT ALLOW FOR

THE USE OF A HOSTED SOFTWARE PRODUCT OR SERVICE OVER A CONTRACTUALLY DETERMINED PERIOD OF TIME WITHOUT TAKING POSSESSION OF SOFTWARE ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS WITH BILLINGS RECORDED AS UNEARNED REVENUE AND RECOGNIZED AS REVENUE RATABLY OVER

THE COVERAGE PERIOD BEGINNING ON THE DATE THE SERVICE IS MADE AVAILABLE TO CUSTOMERS. REVENUE FROM CLOUD-BASED SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE PROVIDED ON A CONSUMPTION BASIS (FOR EXAMPLE, THE AMOUNT OF STORAGE USED IN A PARTICULAR PERIOD) IS

RECOGNIZED COMMENSURATE WITH THE CUSTOMER UTILIZATION OF SUCH RESOURCES.

SOME VOLUME LICENSING ARRANGEMENTS INCLUDE TIME-BASED

SUBSCRIPTIONS FOR CLOUD-BASED SERVICES AND SOFTWARE OFFERINGS THAT ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS. THESE ARRANGEMENTS ARE CONSIDERED MULTIPLE-ELEMENT ARRANGEMENTS. HOWEVER, BECAUSE ALL ELEMENTS ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS SUBSCRIPTIONS AND HAVE THE

SAME COVERAGE PERIOD AND DELIVERY PATTERN, THEY HAVE THE SAME REVENUE RECOGNITION TIMING.

REVENUE RELATED TO PHONES, SURFACE, XBOX CONSOLES, GAMES PUBLISHED BY US, AND OTHER HARDWARE

COMPONENTS IS GENERALLY RECOGNIZED WHEN OWNERSHIP IS TRANSFERRED TO THE RESELLERS OR TO END CUSTOMERS WHEN SELLING DIRECTLY THROUGH MICROSOFT RETAIL STORES AND ONLINE MARKETPLACES. A PORTION OF REVENUE MAY BE DEFERRED WHEN THESE PRODUCTS ARE

COMBINED WITH SOFTWARE ELEMENTS, AND/OR SERVICES. REVENUE RELATED TO LICENSING FOR GAMES PUBLISHED BY THIRD PARTIES FOR USE ON THE XBOX CONSOLES IS RECOGNIZED WHEN GAMES ARE MANUFACTURED BY THE GAME PUBLISHERS.

DISPLAY ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS ADVERTISEMENTS ARE DISPLAYED. SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED WHEN THE AD APPEARS IN THE

SEARCH RESULTS OR WHEN THE ACTION NECESSARY TO EARN THE REVENUE HAS BEEN COMPLETED. CONSULTING SERVICES REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE RENDERED, GENERALLY BASED ON THE NEGOTIATED HOURLY RATE IN THE CONSULTING ARRANGEMENT AND THE NUMBER OF

HOURS WORKED DURING THE PERIOD. CONSULTING REVENUE FOR FIXED-PRICE SERVICES ARRANGEMENTS IS RECOGNIZED AS SERVICES ARE PROVIDED. REVENUE FROM PREPAID POINTS REDEEMABLE FOR THE PURCHASE OF SOFTWARE OR SERVICES IS RECOGNIZED UPON REDEMPTION OF THE

POINTS AND DELIVERY OF THE SOFTWARE OR SERVICES.

COST OF REVENUE

COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES: MANUFACTURING AND DISTRIBUTION COSTS FOR PRODUCTS SOLD AND PROGRAMS LICENSED; OPERATING COSTS RELATED TO PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICE CENTERS AND PRODUCT DISTRIBUTION CENTERS; COSTS INCURRED TO

INCLUDE SOFTWARE ON PCS SOLD BY OEMS, TO DRIVE TRAFFIC TO OUR WEBSITES, AND TO ACQUIRE ONLINE ADVERTISING SPACE (TRAFFIC ACQUISITION COSTS); COSTS INCURRED TO SUPPORT AND MAINTAIN INTERNET-BASED PRODUCTS AND SERVICES, INCLUDING

DATACENTER COSTS AND ROYALTIES; WARRANTY COSTS; INVENTORY VALUATION ADJUSTMENTS; COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DELIVERY OF CONSULTING SERVICES; AND THE AMORTIZATION OF CAPITALIZED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS. CAPITALIZED RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

COSTS ARE AMORTIZED OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PRODUCTS.

PRODUCT WARRANTY

WE PROVIDE FOR THE ESTIMATED COSTS OF FULFILLING OUR OBLIGATIONS UNDER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE WARRANTIES AT THE TIME THE RELATED REVENUE IS

RECOGNIZED. FOR HARDWARE WARRANTIES, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS BASED ON HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED PRODUCT FAILURE RATES, HISTORICAL AND PROJECTED REPAIR COSTS, AND KNOWLEDGE OF SPECIFIC PRODUCT FAILURES (IF ANY). THE SPECIFIC HARDWARE WARRANTY TERMS AND

CONDITIONS VARY DEPENDING UPON THE PRODUCT SOLD AND THE COUNTRY IN WHICH WE DO BUSINESS, BUT GENERALLY INCLUDE PARTS AND LABOR OVER A PERIOD GENERALLY RANGING FROM 90 DAYS TO THREE YEARS. FOR SOFTWARE WARRANTIES, WE ESTIMATE THE COSTS TO

PROVIDE BUG FIXES, SUCH AS SECURITY PATCHES, OVER THE ESTIMATED LIFE OF THE SOFTWARE. WE REGULARLY REEVALUATE OUR ESTIMATES TO ASSESS THE ADEQUACY OF THE RECORDED WARRANTY LIABILITIES AND ADJUST THE AMOUNTS AS NECESSARY.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT. RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSES ALSO INCLUDE THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND

PROGRAMMING COSTS, LOCALIZATION COSTS INCURRED TO TRANSLATE SOFTWARE FOR INTERNATIONAL MARKETS, AND THE AMORTIZATION OF PURCHASED SOFTWARE CODE AND SERVICES CONTENT. SUCH COSTS RELATED TO SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT ARE INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE UNTIL THE POINT THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS REACHED, WHICH FOR OUR SOFTWARE PRODUCTS, IS GENERALLY SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS REACHED, SUCH COSTS ARE CAPITALIZED AND

AMORTIZED TO COST OF REVENUE OVER THE ESTIMATED LIVES OF THE PRODUCTS.

SALES AND MARKETING

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES INCLUDE PAYROLL, EMPLOYEE BENEFITS, STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION EXPENSE, AND OTHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED EXPENSES ASSOCIATED

WITH SALES AND MARKETING PERSONNEL, AND THE COSTS OF ADVERTISING, PROMOTIONS, TRADE SHOWS, SEMINARS, AND OTHER PROGRAMS. ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $2.3 BILLION, $2.6 BILLION, AND $1.6 BILLION IN FISCAL YEARS

2014, 2013, AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION

WE MEASURE STOCK-BASED COMPENSATION COST AT THE GRANT DATE BASED ON THE FAIR VALUE OF THE AWARD AND RECOGNIZE IT AS EXPENSE, NET OF ESTIMATED FORFEITURES, OVER THE VESTING OR SERVICE PERIOD, AS APPLICABLE, OF THE

STOCK AWARD (GENERALLY FOUR TO FIVE YEARS) USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD.

EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN

SHARES OF OUR COMMON STOCK MAY BE PURCHASED BY EMPLOYEES AT THREE-MONTH INTERVALS AT 90% OF THE FAIR MARKET VALUE OF THE STOCK ON THE LAST DAY OF

EACH THREE-MONTH PERIOD. COMPENSATION EXPENSE FOR THE EMPLOYEE STOCK PURCHASE PLAN IS MEASURED AS THE DISCOUNT THE EMPLOYEE IS ENTITLED TO UPON PURCHASE AND IS RECOGNIZED IN THE PERIOD OF PURCHASE.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES

U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL INCOME TAXES, THE PROVISION FOR U.S. TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES NOT DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY INVESTED, AND INTEREST AND PENALTIES ON UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS. CERTAIN INCOME AND EXPENSES ARE

NOT REPORTED IN TAX RETURNS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE SAME YEAR. THE TAX EFFECT OF SUCH TEMPORARY DIFFERENCES IS REPORTED AS DEFERRED INCOME TAXES. DEFERRED TAX ASSETS ARE REPORTED NET OF A VALUATION ALLOWANCE WHEN IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT

THAT A TAX BENEFIT WILL NOT BE REALIZED. THE DEFERRED INCOME TAXES ARE CLASSIFIED AS CURRENT OR LONG-TERM BASED ON THE CLASSIFICATION OF THE RELATED ASSET OR LIABILITY.

FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS

WE ACCOUNT FOR CERTAIN ASSETS AND LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE. THE

HIERARCHY BELOW LISTS THREE LEVELS OF FAIR VALUE BASED ON THE EXTENT TO WHICH INPUTS USED IN MEASURING FAIR VALUE ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET. WE CATEGORIZE EACH OF OUR FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS IN ONE OF THESE THREE LEVELS BASED ON THE LOWEST

LEVEL INPUT THAT IS SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENT IN ITS ENTIRETY. THESE LEVELS ARE.



LEVEL 1

 INPUTS ARE BASED UPON UNADJUSTED QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL INSTRUMENTS TRADED IN ACTIVE MARKETS. OUR LEVEL 1 NON-DERIVATIVE

INVESTMENTS PRIMARILY INCLUDE U.S. GOVERNMENT SECURITIES, DOMESTIC AND INTERNATIONAL EQUITIES, AND ACTIVELY TRADED MUTUAL FUNDS. OUR LEVEL 1 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES INCLUDE THOSE ACTIVELY TRADED ON EXCHANGES.



LEVEL 2

 INPUTS ARE BASED UPON QUOTED PRICES FOR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN ACTIVE MARKETS, QUOTED PRICES FOR IDENTICAL OR SIMILAR INSTRUMENTS IN

MARKETS THAT ARE NOT ACTIVE, AND MODEL-BASED VALUATION TECHNIQUES (E.G. THE BLACK-SCHOLES MODEL) FOR WHICH ALL SIGNIFICANT INPUTS ARE OBSERVABLE IN THE MARKET OR CAN BE CORROBORATED BY OBSERVABLE MARKET DATA FOR SUBSTANTIALLY THE FULL TERM OF THE

ASSETS OR LIABILITIES. WHERE APPLICABLE, THESE MODELS PROJECT FUTURE CASH FLOWS AND DISCOUNT THE FUTURE AMOUNTS TO A PRESENT VALUE USING MARKET-BASED OBSERVABLE INPUTS INCLUDING INTEREST RATE CURVES, CREDIT SPREADS, FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, AND

FORWARD AND SPOT PRICES FOR CURRENCIES AND COMMODITIES. OUR LEVEL 2 NON-DERIVATIVE INVESTMENTS CONSIST PRIMARILY OF CORPORATE NOTES AND BONDS, COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK, MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES, CERTIFICATES OF DEPOSIT, AND FOREIGN GOVERNMENT

BONDS. OUR LEVEL 2 DERIVATIVE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES PRIMARILY INCLUDE CERTAIN OVER-THE-COUNTER OPTION AND SWAP CONTRACTS.



LEVEL 3

 INPUTS ARE GENERALLY UNOBSERVABLE AND TYPICALLY REFLECT MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATES OF ASSUMPTIONS THAT MARKET PARTICIPANTS WOULD USE IN

PRICING THE ASSET OR LIABILITY. THE FAIR VALUES ARE THEREFORE DETERMINED USING MODEL-BASED TECHNIQUES, INCLUDING OPTION PRICING MODELS AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW MODELS. OUR LEVEL 3 NON-DERIVATIVE ASSETS PRIMARILY COMPRISE INVESTMENTS IN COMMON AND

PREFERRED STOCK AND GOODWILL WHEN IT IS RECORDED AT FAIR VALUE DUE TO AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE. UNOBSERVABLE INPUTS USED IN THE MODELS ARE SIGNIFICANT TO THE FAIR VALUES OF THE ASSETS AND LIABILITIES.

WE MEASURE CERTAIN ASSETS, INCLUDING OUR COST AND EQUITY METHOD INVESTMENTS, AT FAIR VALUE ON A NONRECURRING BASIS WHEN THEY ARE DEEMED TO BE

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS ARE DETERMINED

61

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

BASED ON VALUATION TECHNIQUES USING THE BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE, AND MAY INCLUDE QUOTED MARKET PRICES, MARKET COMPARABLES, AND DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW PROJECTIONS. AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS

RECORDED WHEN THE COST OF THE INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE AND THIS CONDITION IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY.

OUR OTHER

CURRENT FINANCIAL ASSETS AND OUR CURRENT FINANCIAL LIABILITIES HAVE FAIR VALUES THAT APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUES.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

WE CONSIDER ALL HIGHLY LIQUID INTEREST-EARNING INVESTMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO BE

CASH EQUIVALENTS. THE FAIR VALUES OF THESE INVESTMENTS APPROXIMATE THEIR CARRYING VALUES. IN GENERAL, INVESTMENTS WITH ORIGINAL MATURITIES OF GREATER THAN THREE MONTHS AND REMAINING MATURITIES OF LESS THAN ONE YEAR ARE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM

INVESTMENTS. INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES BEYOND ONE YEAR MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM BASED ON THEIR HIGHLY LIQUID NATURE AND BECAUSE SUCH MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT THE INVESTMENT OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. ALL CASH

EQUIVALENTS AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. CHANGES IN MARKET VALUE, EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, ARE REFLECTED IN

OCI.

EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS CLASSIFIED AS LONG-TERM INCLUDE BOTH DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CERTAIN

CORPORATE NOTES THAT ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY, DEBT AND PUBLICLY-TRADED EQUITY SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE AND REALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE RECORDED USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. CHANGES IN THE MARKET VALUE

OF AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS, ARE REFLECTED IN OCI. HELD-TO-MATURITY INVESTMENTS ARE RECORDED AND HELD AT AMORTIZED COST. COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK AND OTHER INVESTMENTS THAT ARE RESTRICTED FOR MORE

THAN ONE YEAR OR ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRADED ARE RECORDED AT COST OR USING THE EQUITY METHOD.

WE LEND CERTAIN FIXED-INCOME AND EQUITY

SECURITIES TO INCREASE INVESTMENT RETURNS. THE LOANED SECURITIES CONTINUE TO BE CARRIED AS INVESTMENTS ON OUR BALANCE SHEET. CASH AND/OR SECURITY INTERESTS ARE RECEIVED AS COLLATERAL FOR THE LOANED SECURITIES WITH THE AMOUNT DETERMINED BASED UPON

THE UNDERLYING SECURITY LENT AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. CASH RECEIVED IS RECORDED AS AN ASSET WITH A CORRESPONDING LIABILITY.

INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. FAIR VALUE IS CALCULATED BASED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MARKET INFORMATION OR OTHER ESTIMATES DETERMINED BY

MANAGEMENT. WE EMPLOY A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY ON A QUARTERLY BASIS THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF OUR INVESTMENTS. IF THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, WE

EVALUATE, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, GENERAL MARKET CONDITIONS, CREDIT QUALITY OF DEBT INSTRUMENT ISSUERS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST, AND FOR EQUITY SECURITIES, OUR INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD, OR PLANS TO SELL, THE

INVESTMENT. FOR FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, WE ALSO EVALUATE WHETHER WE HAVE PLANS TO SELL THE SECURITY OR IT IS MORE LIKELY THAN NOT THAT WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO SELL THE SECURITY BEFORE RECOVERY. WE ALSO CONSIDER SPECIFIC ADVERSE CONDITIONS RELATED TO

THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY,

AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED TO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE) AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED.

DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS ARE RECOGNIZED AS EITHER ASSETS OR LIABILITIES AND ARE MEASURED AT FAIR VALUE. THE ACCOUNTING FOR CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF A DERIVATIVE DEPENDS ON THE INTENDED USE OF THE DERIVATIVE AND THE RESULTING DESIGNATION.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, THE GAINS (LOSSES) ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS IN THE PERIODS OF CHANGE TOGETHER WITH

THE OFFSETTING LOSSES (GAINS) ON THE HEDGED ITEMS ATTRIBUTED TO THE RISK BEING HEDGED. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGES, THE EFFECTIVE PORTION OF THE GAINS (LOSSES) ON THE DERIVATIVES IS INITIALLY

REPORTED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI AND IS SUBSEQUENTLY RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS WHEN THE HEDGED

EXPOSURE IS RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS. FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED AS CASH-FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS AND ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

GAINS (LOSSES) ON DERIVATIVES REPRESENTING EITHER HEDGE COMPONENTS EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF EFFECTIVENESS OR HEDGE INEFFECTIVENESS ARE RECOGNIZED IN EARNINGS.

FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS THAT ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGES, GAINS (LOSSES) FROM CHANGES IN FAIR VALUES ARE PRIMARILY RECOGNIZED IN OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE). OTHER THAN THOSE DERIVATIVES ENTERED INTO FOR INVESTMENT

PURPOSES, SUCH AS COMMODITY CONTRACTS, THE GAINS (LOSSES) ARE GENERALLY ECONOMICALLY OFFSET BY UNREALIZED GAINS (LOSSES) IN THE UNDERLYING AVAILABLE-FOR-SALE SECURITIES, WHICH ARE RECORDED AS A COMPONENT OF OCI UNTIL THE SECURITIES ARE SOLD OR

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, AT WHICH TIME THE AMOUNTS ARE RECLASSIFIED FROM ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (AOCI) INTO OTHER INCOME (EXPENSE).

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS REFLECTS OUR BEST

ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE BALANCE. WE DETERMINE THE ALLOWANCE BASED ON KNOWN TROUBLED ACCOUNTS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND OTHER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. ACTIVITY IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS WAS

INVENTORIES

INVENTORIES ARE STATED AT AVERAGE COST, SUBJECT TO THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET. COST INCLUDES MATERIALS, LABOR, AND MANUFACTURING OVERHEAD RELATED

TO THE PURCHASE AND PRODUCTION OF INVENTORIES. WE REGULARLY REVIEW INVENTORY QUANTITIES ON HAND, FUTURE PURCHASE COMMITMENTS WITH OUR SUPPLIERS, AND THE ESTIMATED UTILITY OF OUR INVENTORY. IF OUR REVIEW INDICATES A REDUCTION IN UTILITY BELOW

CARRYING VALUE, WE REDUCE OUR INVENTORY TO A NEW COST BASIS THROUGH A CHARGE TO COST OF REVENUE. THE DETERMINATION OF MARKET VALUE AND THE ESTIMATED VOLUME OF DEMAND USED IN THE LOWER OF COST OR MARKET ANALYSIS REQUIRE SIGNIFICANT JUDGMENT.

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT

PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT IS STATED AT COST AND DEPRECIATED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THE SHORTER OF THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIFE OF THE ASSET

OR THE LEASE TERM. THE ESTIMATED USEFUL LIVES OF OUR PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT ARE GENERALLY AS FOLLOWS: COMPUTER SOFTWARE DEVELOPED OR ACQUIRED FOR INTERNAL USE, THREE TO SEVEN YEARS; COMPUTER EQUIPMENT, TWO TO THREE YEARS; BUILDINGS AND IMPROVEMENTS,

FIVE TO 15 YEARS; LEASEHOLD IMPROVEMENTS, TWO TO 20 YEARS; AND FURNITURE AND EQUIPMENT, ONE TO 10 YEARS. LAND IS NOT DEPRECIATED.

GOODWILL

GOODWILL IS TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT THE REPORTING UNIT LEVEL (OPERATING SEGMENT OR ONE LEVEL BELOW AN OPERATING SEGMENT) ON AN

ANNUAL BASIS (MAY 1 FOR US) AND BETWEEN ANNUAL TESTS IF AN EVENT OCCURS OR CIRCUMSTANCES CHANGE THAT WOULD MORE LIKELY THAN NOT REDUCE THE FAIR VALUE OF A REPORTING UNIT BELOW ITS CARRYING VALUE.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

ALL OF OUR INTANGIBLE

ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION AND ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR ESTIMATED PERIOD OF BENEFIT, RANGING FROM ONE TO 15 YEARS. WE EVALUATE THE RECOVERABILITY OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS PERIODICALLY BY TAKING INTO ACCOUNT EVENTS

OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT MAY WARRANT REVISED ESTIMATES OF USEFUL LIVES OR THAT INDICATE THE ASSET MAY BE IMPAIRED.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

RECENTLY ADOPTED ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE

IN DECEMBER 2011, THE FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS

BOARD (FASB) ISSUED GUIDANCE ENHANCING DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ABOUT THE NATURE OF AN ENTITYS RIGHT TO OFFSET AND RELATED ARRANGEMENTS ASSOCIATED WITH ITS FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS. THE NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THE DISCLOSURE OF THE GROSS

AMOUNTS SUBJECT TO RIGHTS OF SET-OFF, AMOUNTS OFFSET IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE ACCOUNTING STANDARDS FOLLOWED, AND THE RELATED NET EXPOSURE. IN JANUARY 2013, THE FASB CLARIFIED THAT THE SCOPE OF THIS GUIDANCE APPLIES TO DERIVATIVES, REPURCHASE

AGREEMENTS, AND SECURITIES LENDING ARRANGEMENTS THAT ARE EITHER OFFSET OR SUBJECT TO AN ENFORCEABLE MASTER NETTING ARRANGEMENT, OR SIMILAR AGREEMENTS. WE ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE RESULTED

ONLY IN CHANGES TO THE PRESENTATION OF NOTE 5  DERIVATIVES.

IN FEBRUARY 2013, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS

FOR ITEMS RECLASSIFIED OUT OF AOCI. THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES ENTITIES TO PRESENT (EITHER ON THE FACE OF THE INCOME STATEMENT OR IN THE NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS) THE EFFECTS ON THE LINE ITEMS OF THE INCOME STATEMENT FOR AMOUNTS RECLASSIFIED

OUT OF AOCI. WE ADOPTED THIS NEW GUIDANCE BEGINNING JULY 1, 2013. ADOPTION OF THIS NEW GUIDANCE RESULTED ONLY IN CHANGES TO THE PRESENTATION OF NOTE 19  ACCUMULATED OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME.

RECENT ACCOUNTING GUIDANCE NOT YET ADOPTED

IN MARCH 2013, THE FASB ISSUED GUIDANCE ON A PARENTS ACCOUNTING FOR THE CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT UPON DERECOGNITION OF A SUBSIDIARY

OR GROUP OF ASSETS WITHIN A FOREIGN ENTITY. THIS NEW GUIDANCE REQUIRES THAT THE PARENT RELEASE ANY RELATED CUMULATIVE TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENT INTO NET INCOME ONLY IF THE SALE OR TRANSFER RESULTS IN THE COMPLETE OR SUBSTANTIALLY COMPLETE LIQUIDATION

OF THE FOREIGN ENTITY IN WHICH THE SUBSIDIARY OR GROUP OF ASSETS HAD RESIDED. THE NEW GUIDANCE WILL BE EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2014. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE MATERIAL IMPACTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS UPON ADOPTION.

IN MAY 2014, AS PART OF ITS ONGOING EFFORTS TO ASSIST IN THE CONVERGENCE OF U.S. GAAP AND INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS,

THE FASB ISSUED A NEW STANDARD RELATED TO REVENUE RECOGNITION. UNDER THE NEW STANDARD, RECOGNITION OF REVENUE OCCURS WHEN A CUSTOMER OBTAINS CONTROL OF PROMISED GOODS OR SERVICES IN AN AMOUNT THAT REFLECTS THE CONSIDERATION TO WHICH THE ENTITY

EXPECTS TO RECEIVE IN EXCHANGE FOR THOSE GOODS OR SERVICES. IN ADDITION, THE STANDARD REQUIRES DISCLOSURE OF THE NATURE, AMOUNT, TIMING, AND UNCERTAINTY OF REVENUE AND CASH FLOWS ARISING FROM CONTRACTS WITH CUSTOMERS. THE NEW STANDARD WILL BE

EFFECTIVE FOR US BEGINNING JULY 1, 2017 AND EARLY ADOPTION IS NOT PERMITTED. WE ANTICIPATE THIS STANDARD WILL HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT, AND WE ARE CURRENTLY EVALUATING THE IMPACT THIS STANDARD WILL HAVE ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOTE 2  EARNINGS PER SHARE

BASIC EARNINGS PER SHARE (EPS) IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK

OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD. DILUTED EPS IS COMPUTED BASED ON THE WEIGHTED AVERAGE NUMBER OF SHARES OF COMMON STOCK PLUS THE EFFECT OF DILUTIVE POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES OUTSTANDING DURING THE PERIOD USING THE TREASURY STOCK METHOD. DILUTIVE

POTENTIAL COMMON SHARES INCLUDE OUTSTANDING STOCK OPTIONS AND STOCK AWARDS.

WITH OUR AGREEMENT TO LEND $2.0 BILLION TO THE GROUP THAT COMPLETED THEIR ACQUISITION OF DELL ON OCTOBER 29, 2013. THESE CORPORATE NOTES ARE CLASSIFIED AS HELD-TO-MATURITY INVESTMENTS AND ARE INCLUDED IN EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS ON THE

BALANCE SHEET. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE AMORTIZED COST, RECORDED BASIS, AND ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE CORPORATE NOTES WAS $1.5 BILLION, $1.5 BILLION, AND $1.7 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WHILE THEIR ASSOCIATED GROSS UNRECOGNIZED HOLDING

GAINS WERE $164 MILLION.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2014 AND 2013, THE RECORDED BASES OF COMMON AND PREFERRED STOCK THAT ARE RESTRICTED FOR

MORE THAN ONE YEAR OR ARE NOT PUBLICLY TRADED WERE $520 MILLION AND $395 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THESE INVESTMENTS ARE CARRIED AT COST AND ARE REVIEWED QUARTERLY FOR INDICATORS OF OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENT. IT IS NOT PRACTICABLE FOR US TO

ITEM 8

NOTE 5  DERIVATIVES

WE USE DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE RISKS RELATED TO FOREIGN CURRENCIES, EQUITY PRICES, INTEREST RATES, AND CREDIT; TO

ENHANCE INVESTMENT RETURNS; AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. OUR OBJECTIVES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVES INCLUDE REDUCING, ELIMINATING, AND EFFICIENTLY MANAGING THE ECONOMIC IMPACT OF THESE EXPOSURES AS EFFECTIVELY AS POSSIBLE. OUR DERIVATIVE

PROGRAMS INCLUDE STRATEGIES THAT BOTH QUALIFY AND DO NOT QUALIFY FOR HEDGE ACCOUNTING TREATMENT. ALL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS PRESENTED BELOW ARE MEASURED IN U.S. DOLLAR EQUIVALENTS.

FOREIGN CURRENCY

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS, ASSETS, AND LIABILITIES ARE EXPOSED TO

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. WE MONITOR OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE ECONOMIC EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE POSITIONS. OPTION AND FORWARD CONTRACTS ARE USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INTERNATIONAL REVENUE FOR

UP TO THREE YEARS IN THE FUTURE AND ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014 AND JUNE 30, 2013, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS SOLD WERE $4.9 BILLION AND $5.1 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISKS RELATED TO

CERTAIN NON-U.S. DOLLAR DENOMINATED SECURITIES ARE HEDGED USING FOREIGN EXCHANGE FORWARD CONTRACTS THAT ARE DESIGNATED AS FAIR VALUE HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014 AND JUNE 30, 2013, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN

EXCHANGE CONTRACTS SOLD WERE $3.1 BILLION AND $407 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CERTAIN OPTIONS AND FORWARDS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING

INSTRUMENTS ARE ALSO USED TO MANAGE THE VARIABILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE, CASH, AND INTERCOMPANY POSITIONS, AND TO MANAGE OTHER FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE

FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $6.2 BILLION AND $8.5 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF THESE FOREIGN EXCHANGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $5.0 BILLION AND $7.9 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY.

EQUITY

SECURITIES HELD IN OUR EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET PRICE RISK. MARKET PRICE RISK IS MANAGED RELATIVE TO

BROAD-BASED GLOBAL AND DOMESTIC EQUITY INDICES USING CERTAIN CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED INVESTMENTS, OPTIONS, FUTURES, AND SWAP CONTRACTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. FROM TIME TO TIME, TO HEDGE OUR PRICE RISK, WE MAY USE AND DESIGNATE EQUITY

DERIVATIVES AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING PUTS, CALLS, SWAPS, AND FORWARDS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF EQUITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD FOR MANAGING MARKET PRICE RISK WERE $3.1 BILLION AND $2.1 BILLION,

RESPECTIVELY, OF WHICH $362 MILLION AND $420 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF EQUITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD FOR MANAGING MARKET PRICE RISK WERE $898 MILLION

AND $1.0 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY, NONE OF WHICH WERE DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

INTEREST RATE

SECURITIES HELD IN OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO DIFFERENT INTEREST RATE RISKS BASED ON THEIR MATURITIES. WE MANAGE THE AVERAGE

MATURITY OF OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO TO ACHIEVE ECONOMIC RETURNS THAT CORRELATE TO CERTAIN BROAD-BASED FIXED-INCOME INDICES USING EXCHANGE-TRADED OPTION AND FUTURES CONTRACTS AND OVER-THE-COUNTER SWAP AND OPTION CONTRACTS, NONE OF WHICH ARE

DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF FIXED-INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $503 MILLION AND $741 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF

FIXED-INTEREST RATE CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.1 BILLION AND $809 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

IN ADDITION, WE USE TO BE

ANNOUNCED FORWARD PURCHASE COMMITMENTS OF MORTGAGE-BACKED ASSETS TO GAIN EXPOSURE TO AGENCY MORTGAGE-BACKED SECURITIES. THESE MEET THE DEFINITION OF A DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENT IN CASES WHERE PHYSICAL DELIVERY OF THE ASSETS IS NOT TAKEN AT

THE EARLIEST AVAILABLE DELIVERY DATE. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014 AND 2013, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL DERIVATIVE AMOUNTS OF MORTGAGE CONTRACTS PURCHASED WERE $1.1 BILLION AND $1.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

68

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

CREDIT

OUR FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT-GRADE SECURITIES. WE USE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAP CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO MANAGE CREDIT EXPOSURES RELATIVE TO

BROAD-BASED INDICES AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. WE USE CREDIT DEFAULT SWAPS AS THEY ARE A LOW COST METHOD OF MANAGING EXPOSURE TO INDIVIDUAL CREDIT RISKS OR GROUPS OF CREDIT RISKS. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL

AMOUNTS OF CREDIT CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $412 MILLION AND $440 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF CREDIT CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $377 MILLION AND $501 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

COMMODITY

WE USE BROAD-BASED

COMMODITY EXPOSURES TO ENHANCE PORTFOLIO RETURNS AND TO FACILITATE PORTFOLIO DIVERSIFICATION. WE USE SWAPS, FUTURES, AND OPTION CONTRACTS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO GENERATE AND MANAGE EXPOSURES TO BROAD-BASED COMMODITY INDICES. WE

USE DERIVATIVES ON COMMODITIES AS THEY CAN BE LOW-COST ALTERNATIVES TO THE PURCHASE AND STORAGE OF A VARIETY OF COMMODITIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PRECIOUS METALS, ENERGY, AND GRAIN. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF

COMMODITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.4 BILLION AND $408 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. AS OF JUNE 30, 2013, THE TOTAL NOTIONAL AMOUNTS OF COMMODITY CONTRACTS PURCHASED AND SOLD WERE $1.2 BILLION AND $249 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

CREDIT-RISK-RELATED CONTINGENT FEATURES

CERTAIN OF OUR COUNTERPARTY AGREEMENTS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS CONTAIN PROVISIONS THAT REQUIRE OUR ISSUED AND OUTSTANDING LONG-TERM UNSECURED

DEBT TO MAINTAIN AN INVESTMENT GRADE CREDIT RATING AND REQUIRE US TO MAINTAIN MINIMUM LIQUIDITY OF $1.0 BILLION. TO THE EXTENT WE FAIL TO MEET THESE REQUIREMENTS, WE WILL BE REQUIRED TO POST COLLATERAL, SIMILAR TO THE STANDARD CONVENTION RELATED TO

OVER-THE-COUNTER DERIVATIVES. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, OUR LONG-TERM UNSECURED DEBT RATING WAS AAA, AND CASH INVESTMENTS WERE IN EXCESS OF $1.0 BILLION. AS A RESULT, NO COLLATERAL WAS REQUIRED TO BE POSTED.

RESULTS THAT WOULD HAVE BEEN REALIZED HAD WE BEEN A COMBINED COMPANY DURING THE PERIODS PRESENTED AND ARE NOT NECESSARILY INDICATIVE OF OUR CONSOLIDATED RESULTS OF OPERATIONS IN FUTURE PERIODS. THE PRO FORMA RESULTS INCLUDE ADJUSTMENTS PRIMARILY

RELATED TO PURCHASE ACCOUNTING ADJUSTMENTS AND THE ELIMINATION OF RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND NDS. ACQUISITION COSTS AND OTHER NON-RECURRING CHARGES INCURRED ARE INCLUDED IN THE EARLIEST PERIOD PRESENTED.

DURING THE FOURTH QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2014, WE INCURRED $21 MILLION OF ACQUISITION COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PURCHASE OF NDS. ACQUISITION COSTS

ARE PRIMARILY COMPRISED OF TRANSACTION FEES AND DIRECT ACQUISITION COSTS, INCLUDING LEGAL, FINANCE, CONSULTING, AND OTHER PROFESSIONAL FEES. THESE COSTS ARE INCLUDED IN INTEGRATION AND RESTRUCTURING COSTS ON OUR CONSOLIDATED INCOME STATEMENT FOR

FISCAL YEAR 2014.

CERTAIN CONCURRENT TRANSACTIONS WERE RECOGNIZED SEPARATELY FROM THE ACQUISITION. PRIOR TO THE ACQUISITION, WE HAD

JOINT STRATEGIC INITIATIVES WITH NOKIA; THIS CONTRACTUAL RELATIONSHIP WAS TERMINATED IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE ACQUISITION. NO GAIN OR LOSS WAS RECORDED UPON TERMINATION OF THIS AGREEMENT, AS IT WAS DETERMINED TO BE AT MARKET VALUE. IN ADDITION, WE

AGREED TO LICENSE NOKIAS MAPPING SERVICES AND WILL PAY NOKIA SEPARATELY FOR THE SERVICES PROVIDED UNDER A FOUR-YEAR LICENSE AS THEY ARE RENDERED.

YAMMER

ON JULY 18, 2012, WE ACQUIRED

YAMMER, INC. (YAMMER), A LEADING PROVIDER OF ENTERPRISE SOCIAL NETWORKS, FOR $1.1 BILLION IN CASH. YAMMER WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ITS STANDALONE SERVICE AND WILL ADD AN ENTERPRISE SOCIAL NETWORKING SERVICE TO MICROSOFTS PORTFOLIO

OF COMPLEMENTARY CLOUD-BASED SERVICES. THE MAJOR CLASSES OF ASSETS TO WHICH WE ALLOCATED THE PURCHASE PRICE WERE GOODWILL OF $937 MILLION AND IDENTIFIABLE INTANGIBLE ASSETS OF $178 MILLION. WE ASSIGNED THE GOODWILL TO COMMERCIAL OTHER UNDER OUR

$1.6 BILLION, AND UNEARNED REVENUE OF $222 MILLION. THE GOODWILL RECOGNIZED IN CONNECTION WITH THE ACQUISITION IS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO OUR EXPECTATION OF EXTENDING SKYPES BRAND AND THE REACH OF ITS NETWORKED PLATFORM, WHILE ENHANCING

MICROSOFTS EXISTING PORTFOLIO OF REAL-TIME COMMUNICATIONS PRODUCTS AND SERVICES. WE ASSIGNED THE GOODWILL TO THE FOLLOWING SEGMENTS UNDER OUR CURRENT SEGMENT STRUCTURE: $5.6 BILLION TO COMMERCIAL LICENSING, $1.4 BILLION TO COMPUTING AND GAMING

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 21  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA, DURING THE FIRST QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2014, WE CHANGED OUR ORGANIZATIONAL

STRUCTURE AS PART OF OUR TRANSFORMATION TO A DEVICES AND SERVICES COMPANY. THIS RESULTED IN A CHANGE IN OUR OPERATING SEGMENTS AND REPORTING UNITS. WE ALLOCATED GOODWILL TO OUR NEW REPORTING UNITS USING A RELATIVE FAIR VALUE APPROACH. IN ADDITION,

WE COMPLETED AN ASSESSMENT OF ANY POTENTIAL GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT FOR ALL REPORTING UNITS IMMEDIATELY PRIOR TO THE REALLOCATION AND DETERMINED THAT NO IMPAIRMENT EXISTED.

GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT

WE TEST GOODWILL FOR IMPAIRMENT ANNUALLY ON MAY 1 AT THE REPORTING

UNIT LEVEL USING A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW METHODOLOGY WITH A PEER-BASED, RISK-ADJUSTED WEIGHTED AVERAGE COST OF CAPITAL. WE BELIEVE USE OF A DISCOUNTED CASH FLOW APPROACH IS THE MOST RELIABLE INDICATOR OF THE FAIR VALUES OF THE BUSINESSES.

NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL WAS IDENTIFIED AS OF MAY 1, 2014 OR MAY 1, 2013. UPON COMPLETION OF THE FISCAL YEAR 2012 TEST, THE GOODWILL OF

OUR OSD UNIT (IN DEVICES AND CONSUMER OTHER UNDER OUR CURRENT SEGMENT STRUCTURE) WAS DETERMINED TO BE IMPAIRED. THE IMPAIRMENT WAS THE RESULT OF THE OSD UNIT EXPERIENCING SLOWER THAN PROJECTED GROWTH IN SEARCH QUERIES AND SEARCH ADVERTISING REVENUE

PER QUERY, SLOWER GROWTH IN DISPLAY REVENUE, AND CHANGES IN THE TIMING AND IMPLEMENTATION OF CERTAIN INITIATIVES DESIGNED TO DRIVE SEARCH AND DISPLAY REVENUE GROWTH IN THE FUTURE. THIS GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT CHARGE OF $6.2 BILLION ALSO REPRESENTED OUR

ACCUMULATED GOODWILL IMPAIRMENT AS OF JUNE 30, 2014 AND 2013.

YEARS 2014, 2013, AND 2012, BY $7.0 BILLION, $6.5 BILLION, AND $6.2 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, 2013, AND 2012, WE

HAD ACCRUED INTEREST EXPENSE RELATED TO UNCERTAIN TAX POSITIONS OF $1.5 BILLION, $1.3 BILLION, AND $939 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY, NET OF FEDERAL INCOME TAX BENEFITS. INTEREST EXPENSE ON UNRECOGNIZED TAX BENEFITS WAS $235 MILLION, $400 MILLION, AND $154

MILLION IN FISCAL YEARS 2014, 2013, AND 2012, RESPECTIVELY.

DURING THE THIRD QUARTER OF FISCAL YEAR 2011, WE REACHED A SETTLEMENT OF A PORTION OF AN I.R.S. AUDIT OF TAX YEARS

2004 TO 2006, WHICH REDUCED OUR INCOME TAX EXPENSE BY $461 MILLION. WHILE WE SETTLED A PORTION OF THE I.R.S. AUDIT, WE REMAIN UNDER AUDIT FOR THESE YEARS. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE I.R.S. WITHDREW ITS 2011 REVENUE AGENTS REPORT AND REOPENED THE AUDIT

PHASE OF THE EXAMINATION. AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, THE PRIMARY UNRESOLVED ISSUE RELATES TO TRANSFER PRICING, WHICH COULD HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IF NOT RESOLVED FAVORABLY. WE BELIEVE OUR ALLOWANCES FOR

INCOME TAX CONTINGENCIES ARE ADEQUATE. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED A PROPOSED ASSESSMENT FOR THE UNRESOLVED ISSUES AND DO NOT EXPECT A FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE ISSUES IN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. BASED ON THE INFORMATION CURRENTLY AVAILABLE, WE DO NOT

ANTICIPATE A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE OR DECREASE TO OUR TAX CONTINGENCIES FOR THESE ISSUES WITHIN THE NEXT 12 MONTHS. WE ALSO CONTINUE TO BE SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION BY THE I.R.S. FOR TAX YEARS 2007 TO 2013.

WE ARE SUBJECT TO INCOME TAX IN MANY JURISDICTIONS OUTSIDE THE U.S. OUR OPERATIONS IN CERTAIN JURISDICTIONS REMAIN SUBJECT TO EXAMINATION FOR TAX

YEARS 1996 TO 2013, SOME OF WHICH ARE CURRENTLY UNDER AUDIT BY LOCAL TAX AUTHORITIES. THE RESOLUTIONS OF THESE AUDITS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE MATERIAL TO OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

INDEMNIFICATIONS

WE PROVIDE INDEMNIFICATIONS OF VARYING SCOPE AND SIZE TO CERTAIN CUSTOMERS AGAINST CLAIMS OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INFRINGEMENT MADE BY THIRD PARTIES ARISING FROM THE USE OF OUR PRODUCTS AND CERTAIN OTHER MATTERS.

WE EVALUATE ESTIMATED LOSSES FOR THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS, AND WE CONSIDER SUCH FACTORS AS THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. TO DATE, WE HAVE NOT ENCOUNTERED

SIGNIFICANT COSTS AS A RESULT OF THESE OBLIGATIONS AND HAVE NOT ACCRUED ANY LIABILITIES RELATED TO THESE INDEMNIFICATIONS IN OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

NOTE 17  CONTINGENCIES

ANTITRUST, UNFAIR COMPETITION, AND OVERCHARGE CLASS ACTIONS

A LARGE NUMBER OF ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS WERE FILED AGAINST US IN VARIOUS STATE, FEDERAL, AND CANADIAN COURTS ON BEHALF OF VARIOUS CLASSES OF DIRECT AND INDIRECT PURCHASERS OF OUR PC

OPERATING SYSTEM AND CERTAIN OTHER SOFTWARE PRODUCTS BETWEEN 1999 AND 2005.

WE OBTAINED DISMISSALS OR REACHED SETTLEMENTS OF ALL CLAIMS

MADE IN THE UNITED STATES. UNDER THE SETTLEMENTS, GENERALLY CLASS MEMBERS CAN OBTAIN VOUCHERS THAT ENTITLE THEM TO BE REIMBURSED FOR PURCHASES OF A WIDE VARIETY OF PLATFORM-NEUTRAL COMPUTER HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE. THE TOTAL VALUE OF VOUCHERS THAT WE

MAY ISSUE VARIES BY STATE. WE WILL MAKE AVAILABLE TO CERTAIN SCHOOLS A PERCENTAGE OF THOSE VOUCHERS THAT ARE NOT ISSUED OR CLAIMED (ONE-HALF TO TWO-

COST OF THE SETTLEMENTS IS APPROXIMATELY $400 MILLION, ALL OF WHICH HAD BEEN ACCRUED AS OF JUNE 30, 2014.

THREE SIMILAR CASES

PENDING IN BRITISH COLUMBIA, ONTARIO, AND QUEBEC, CANADA HAVE NOT BEEN SETTLED. IN MARCH 2010, THE COURT IN THE BRITISH COLUMBIA CASE CERTIFIED IT AS A CLASS ACTION. THE PLAINTIFFS SUCCESSFULLY APPEALED A BRITISH COLUMBIA COURT OF APPEAL DECISION

REVERSING CLASS CERTIFICATION AND DISMISSING THE CASE. IN OCTOBER 2013, THE CANADIAN SUPREME COURT REVERSED THE APPELLATE COURT AND REINSTATED PART OF THE BRITISH COLUMBIA CASE, WHICH IS NOW SCHEDULED FOR TRIAL IN SEPTEMBER 2015. THE OTHER TWO CASES

WERE INACTIVE PENDING ACTION BY THE SUPREME COURT ON THE BRITISH COLUMBIA CASE.

OTHER ANTITRUST LITIGATION AND CLAIMS

NOVELL LITIGATION

IN NOVEMBER 2004,

NOVELL, INC. (NOVELL) FILED A COMPLAINT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF UTAH (LATER TRANSFERRED TO FEDERAL COURT IN MARYLAND), ASSERTING ANTITRUST AND UNFAIR COMPETITION CLAIMS AGAINST US RELATED TO NOVELLS OWNERSHIP OF

WORDPERFECT AND OTHER PRODUCTIVITY APPLICATIONS DURING THE PERIOD BETWEEN JUNE 1994 AND MARCH 1996. AFTER THE TRIAL COURT DISMISSED OR GRANTED SUMMARY JUDGMENT ON A NUMBER OF NOVELLS CLAIMS, TRIAL OF THE ONE REMAINING CLAIM TOOK PLACE IN LATE

2011 AND RESULTED IN A MISTRIAL. IN JULY 2012, THE TRIAL COURT GRANTED MICROSOFTS MOTION FOR JUDGMENT AS A MATTER OF LAW. NOVELL APPEALED THIS DECISION TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE TENTH CIRCUIT, WHICH AFFIRMED THE TRIAL COURTS

DECISION IN SEPTEMBER 2013. THE SUPREME COURT DENIED NOVELLS PETITION FOR REVIEW IN APRIL 2014.

GO COMPUTER LITIGATION

IN JUNE 2005, GO COMPUTER INC. AND CO-FOUNDER JERRY KAPLAN FILED A COMPLAINT IN CALIFORNIA STATE COURT ASSERTING ANTITRUST CLAIMS UNDER THE

CARTWRIGHT ACT RELATED TO THE BUSINESS OF THE FORMER GO CORPORATION IN THE EARLY 1990S AND ITS SUCCESSOR IN INTEREST, LUCENT CORPORATION IN THE EARLY 2000S. ALL CLAIMS PRIOR TO JUNE 2001 HAVE BEEN DISMISSED WITH PREJUDICE AS BARRED BY THE STATUTE OF

LIMITATIONS. AFTER A MINI-TRIAL ON STANDING ISSUES, THE CASE IS NOW MOVING FORWARD WITH DISCOVERY, AND A TRIAL IS SET FOR SEPTEMBER 2015.

CHINA

STATE ADMINISTRATION FOR INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE INVESTIGATION

ON JULY 28, 2014, MICROSOFT WAS INFORMED THAT CHINAS STATE

ADMINISTRATION FOR INDUSTRY AND COMMERCE (SAIC) HAD BEGUN A FORMAL INVESTIGATION RELATING TO CHINAS ANTI-MONOPOLY LAW, AND THE SAIC CONDUCTED ONSITE INSPECTIONS OF MICROSOFT OFFICES IN BEIJING, SHANGHAI, GUANGZHOU, AND CHENGDU. SAIC HAS STATED

THE INVESTIGATION RELATES TO COMPATIBILITY, BUNDLE SALES, AND FILE VERIFICATION ISSUES RELATED TO WINDOWS AND OFFICE SOFTWARE.

PATENT AND

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS

MOTOROLA LITIGATION

IN OCTOBER 2010, MICROSOFT FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT COMPLAINTS AGAINST MOTOROLA MOBILITY (MOTOROLA) WITH THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION (ITC) AND IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE FOR

INFRINGEMENT OF NINE MICROSOFT PATENTS BY MOTOROLAS ANDROID DEVICES. SINCE THEN, MICROSOFT AND MOTOROLA HAVE FILED ADDITIONAL CLAIMS AGAINST EACH OTHER WITH THE ITC, IN FEDERAL DISTRICT COURTS IN SEATTLE, WISCONSIN, FLORIDA, AND CALIFORNIA,

AND IN COURTS IN GERMANY AND THE UNITED KINGDOM. THE NATURE OF THE CLAIMS ASSERTED AND STATUS OF INDIVIDUAL MATTERS ARE SUMMARIZED BELOW.

INTERNATIONAL TRADE COMMISSION

IN MAY

2012, THE ITC ISSUED A LIMITED EXCLUSION ORDER AGAINST MOTOROLA ON ONE MICROSOFT PATENT, WHICH BECAME EFFECTIVE IN JULY 2012 AND WAS AFFIRMED ON APPEAL IN DECEMBER 2013. IN JULY 2013, MICROSOFT FILED AN ACTION IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN

WASHINGTON, D.C. SEEKING AN ORDER TO COMPEL ENFORCEMENT OF THE ITCS MAY 2012 IMPORT BAN AGAINST INFRINGING MOTOROLA PRODUCTS BY THE BUREAU OF CUSTOMS AND BORDER PROTECTION (CBP), AFTER LEARNING THAT CBP HAD FAILED TO FULLY ENFORCE

THE ORDER.

ITEM 8

IN NOVEMBER 2010, MOTOROLA FILED AN ACTION AGAINST MICROSOFT WITH THE ITC ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT OF

FIVE MOTOROLA PATENTS BY XBOX CONSOLES AND ACCESSORIES AND SEEKING AN EXCLUSION ORDER TO PROHIBIT IMPORTATION OF THE ALLEGEDLY INFRINGING XBOX PRODUCTS. AT MOTOROLAS REQUEST, THE ITC TERMINATED ITS INVESTIGATION OF FOUR MOTOROLA PATENTS. IN

MARCH 2013, THE ITC AFFIRMED THERE WAS NO VIOLATION OF THE REMAINING MOTOROLA PATENT. MOTOROLA APPEALED THE ITCS DECISION TO THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE FEDERAL CIRCUIT.

U.S. DISTRICT COURT

THE SEATTLE DISTRICT COURT CASE FILED IN OCTOBER 2010 BY MICROSOFT AS A

COMPANION TO MICROSOFTS ITC CASE AGAINST MOTOROLA WAS STAYED PENDING THE OUTCOME OF THE ITC CASE.

IN NOVEMBER 2010, MICROSOFT

SUED MOTOROLA FOR BREACH OF CONTRACT IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE, ALLEGING THAT MOTOROLA BREACHED ITS COMMITMENTS TO STANDARDS-SETTING ORGANIZATIONS TO LICENSE TO MICROSOFT CERTAIN PATENTS ON REASONABLE AND NON-DISCRIMINATORY

(RAND) TERMS AND CONDITIONS. MOTOROLA HAS DECLARED THESE PATENTS ESSENTIAL TO THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE H.264 VIDEO STANDARD AND THE 802.11 WI-FI STANDARD. IN THE MOTOROLA ITC CASE DESCRIBED ABOVE AND IN SUITS DESCRIBED BELOW, MOTOROLA

OR A MOTOROLA AFFILIATE SUBSEQUENTLY SUED MICROSOFT ON THOSE PATENTS IN U.S. DISTRICT COURTS, IN THE ITC, AND IN GERMANY. IN FEBRUARY 2012, THE SEATTLE DISTRICT COURT GRANTED A PARTIAL SUMMARY JUDGMENT IN FAVOR OF MICROSOFT RULING THAT

(1) MOTOROLA HAD COMMITTED TO STANDARDS ORGANIZATIONS TO LICENSE ITS DECLARED-ESSENTIAL PATENTS ON RAND TERMS AND CONDITIONS; AND (2) MICROSOFT IS A THIRD-PARTY BENEFICIARY OF THOSE COMMITMENTS. AFTER TRIAL, THE SEATTLE DISTRICT COURT SET

PER UNIT ROYALTIES FOR MOTOROLAS H.264 AND 802.11 PATENTS, WHICH RESULTED IN AN IMMATERIAL MICROSOFT LIABILITY. IN SEPTEMBER 2013, FOLLOWING TRIAL OF MICROSOFTS BREACH OF CONTRACT CLAIM, A JURY AWARDED $14.5 MILLION IN DAMAGES TO

MICROSOFT. MOTOROLA APPEALED.

CASES FILED BY MOTOROLA IN WISCONSIN, CALIFORNIA, AND FLORIDA, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE CURRENTLY STAYED

CASE IN WISCONSIN (A COMPANION CASE TO MOTOROLAS ITC ACTION), HAVE BEEN TRANSFERRED TO THE U.S DISTRICT COURT IN SEATTLE. MOTOROLA AND MICROSOFT BOTH SEEK DAMAGES AS WELL AS INJUNCTIVE RELIEF. THE COURT HAS STAYED THESE CASES ON AGREEMENT OF

THE PARTIES.



IN THE TRANSFERRED CASES, MOTOROLA ASSERTS 15 PATENTS ARE INFRINGED BY A RANGE OF MICROSOFT PRODUCTS INCLUDING MOBILE AND PC OPERATING SYSTEM, PRODUCTIVITY,

SERVER, COMMUNICATION, BROWSER AND GAMING PRODUCTS.



IN THE MOTOROLA ACTION ORIGINALLY FILED IN CALIFORNIA, MOTOROLA ASSERTS MICROSOFT VIOLATED ANTITRUST LAWS IN CONNECTION WITH MICROSOFTS ASSERTION OF

PATENTS AGAINST MOTOROLA THAT MICROSOFT AGREED TO LICENSE TO CERTAIN QUALIFYING ENTITIES ON RAND TERMS AND CONDITIONS.



IN COUNTERCLAIMS, MICROSOFT ASSERTS 14 PATENTS ARE INFRINGED BY MOTOROLA ANDROID DEVICES AND CERTAIN MOTOROLA DIGITAL VIDEO RECORDERS.

GERMANY

IN

JULY 2011, MOTOROLA FILED PATENT INFRINGEMENT ACTIONS IN GERMANY AGAINST MICROSOFT AND SEVERAL MICROSOFT SUBSIDIARIES.



MOTOROLA ASSERTS TWO PATENTS (ONE NOW EXPIRED) ARE ESSENTIAL TO IMPLEMENTATION OF THE H.264 VIDEO STANDARD, AND MOTOROLA ALLEGES THAT H.264 CAPABLE PRODUCTS

INCLUDING XBOX 360, WINDOWS 7, MEDIA PLAYER, AND INTERNET EXPLORER INFRINGE THOSE PATENTS. IN MAY 2012, THE COURT ISSUED AN INJUNCTION RELATING TO ALL H.264 CAPABLE MICROSOFT PRODUCTS IN GERMANY, WHICH MICROSOFT APPEALED. ORDERS IN THE LITIGATION

PENDING IN SEATTLE, WASHINGTON DESCRIBED ABOVE ENJOIN MOTOROLA FROM ENFORCING THE GERMAN INJUNCTION.



MOTOROLA ASSERTS THAT ONE PATENT COVERS CERTAIN SYNCING FUNCTIONALITY IN THE ACTIVESYNC PROTOCOL EMPLOYED BY WINDOWS PHONE 7, OUTLOOK MOBILE, HOTMAIL MOBILE,

EXCHANGE ONLINE, EXCHANGE SERVER, AND HOTMAIL SERVER. IN APRIL 2013, THE COURT STAYED THE CASE PENDING THE OUTCOME OF PARALLEL PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH MICROSOFT IS SEEKING TO INVALIDATE THE PATENT. IN NOVEMBER 2013, THE FEDERAL PATENT COURT INVALIDATED

THE ORIGINALLY ISSUED PATENT CLAIMS, BUT RULED THAT CERTAIN NEW AMENDED CLAIMS WERE PATENTABLE. BOTH MOTOROLA AND MICROSOFT APPEALED. IN JUNE 2014, THE COURT REOPENED INFRINGEMENT PROCEEDINGS AND SCHEDULED A HEARING IN NOVEMBER 2014.



MICROSOFT MAY BE ABLE TO MITIGATE THE ADVERSE IMPACT OF ANY INJUNCTION BY ALTERING ITS PRODUCTS TO AVOID MOTOROLAS INFRINGEMENT CLAIMS.



ANY DAMAGES WOULD BE DETERMINED IN SEPARATE PROCEEDINGS.

ITEM 8

IN LAWSUITS MICROSOFT FILED IN GERMANY IN 2011 AND 2012, MICROSOFT ASSERTS THAT MOTOROLA ANDROID

DEVICES INFRINGE MICROSOFT PATENTS AND IS SEEKING DAMAGES AND INJUNCTIONS. IN 2012, REGIONAL COURTS IN GERMANY ISSUED INJUNCTIONS ON THREE OF THE MICROSOFT PATENTS, WHICH MOTOROLA APPEALED. ONE JUDGMENT HAS BEEN AFFIRMED ON APPEAL (AND MOTOROLA HAS

FURTHER APPEALED), AND THE OTHER TWO APPEALS ARE PENDING. IN ACTIONS FILED SEPARATELY BY MOTOROLA TO INVALIDATE THESE PATENTS, THE FEDERAL PATENT COURT IN 2013 AND 2014 HELD THE MICROSOFT PATENTS INVALID, AND MICROSOFT APPEALED. FOR THE CASES IN

WHICH MICROSOFT OBTAINED INJUNCTIONS, IF MOTOROLA WERE TO PREVAIL FOLLOWING ALL APPEALS, MOTOROLA COULD HAVE A CLAIM AGAINST MICROSOFT FOR DAMAGES CAUSED BY AN ERRONEOUSLY GRANTED INJUNCTION.

UNITED KINGDOM

IN DECEMBER 2011, MICROSOFT FILED AN ACTION AGAINST MOTOROLA IN THE HIGH COURT

OF JUSTICE, CHANCERY DIVISION, PATENTS COURT, IN LONDON, ENGLAND, SEEKING TO REVOKE THE UK PART OF THE EUROPEAN PATENT ASSERTED BY MOTOROLA IN GERMANY AGAINST THE ACTIVESYNC PROTOCOL. IN FEBRUARY 2012, MOTOROLA COUNTERCLAIMED ALLEGING INFRINGEMENT

OF THE PATENT AND SEEKING DAMAGES AND AN INJUNCTION. IN DECEMBER 2012, THE COURT RULED THAT MOTOROLAS PATENT IS INVALID. THE COURT ALSO RULED THAT THE PATENT, EVEN IF VALID, WOULD BE LICENSED UNDER THE GRANT-BACK CLAUSE IN GOOGLES

ACTIVESYNC LICENSE. MOTOROLA APPEALED AND THE APPEALS COURT AFFIRMED THE LOWER COURTS RULING IN MICROSOFTS FAVOR IN NOVEMBER 2013. MOTOROLA HAS EXHAUSTED ALL APPEALS AND THE RULINGS IN MICROSOFTS FAVOR ARE FINAL.

IPCOM PATENT LITIGATION

IPCOM

GMBH & CO. IS A GERMAN COMPANY THAT HOLDS A LARGE PORTFOLIO OF MOBILE TECHNOLOGY RELATED PATENTS SPANNING ABOUT 170 PATENT FAMILIES AND ADDRESSING A BROAD RANGE OF CELLULAR TECHNOLOGIES. IPCOM HAS ASSERTED 19 OF THESE PATENTS IN LITIGATION

AGAINST NOKIA AND MANY OF THE LEADING CELL PHONE COMPANIES AND OPERATORS. THREE OF THE INFRINGEMENT SUITS AGAINST NOKIA (NOW ASSUMED BY MICROSOFT THROUGH THE NDS ACQUISITION) ARE STILL PENDING IN COURTS IN GERMANY, ENGLAND, AND ITALY. THESE COURTS

HAVE HELD A NUMBER OF IPCOMS PATENTS WERE INVALID OR NOT INFRINGED. WE CONTINUE TO CONTEST THE VALIDITY OR INFRINGEMENT OF THE PATENTS REMAINING IN DISPUTE.

INTERDIGITAL PATENT LITIGATION

INTERDIGITAL TECHNOLOGY CORPORATION AND INTERDIGITAL

COMMUNICATIONS CORPORATION (COLLECTIVELY, IDT) FILED FOUR PATENT INFRINGEMENT CASES AGAINST NOKIA IN THE ITC AND IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF DELAWARE BETWEEN 2007 AND 2013. WE ARE BEING SUBSTITUTED FOR NOKIA IN THESE

CASES. EACH CASE INCLUDES OTHER CO-DEFENDANTS BECAUSE MOST OF THE PATENTS AT ISSUE ALLEGEDLY RELATE TO 3G AND 4G WIRELESS COMMUNICATIONS STANDARDS ESSENTIAL FUNCTIONALITY. THE SUITE OF CASES INCLUDE THREE ITC INVESTIGATIONS WHERE IDT IS SEEKING AN

ORDER EXCLUDING IMPORTATION OF 3G AND 4G PHONES INTO THE U.S. AND ONE ACTIVE CASE IN U.S. DISTRICT COURT IN DELAWARE SEEKING AN INJUNCTION AND DAMAGES.

EUROPEAN COPYRIGHT LEVIES

WE HAVE ASSUMED

FROM NOKIA ALL POTENTIAL LIABILITY DUE TO NOKIAS ALLEGED FAILURE TO PAY PRIVATE COPYING LEVIES IN VARIOUS EUROPEAN COUNTRIES BASED UPON SALE OF MEMORY CARDS AND MOBILE PHONES THAT INCORPORATE BLANK MEMORY. THE LEVIES ARE BASED

UPON A 2001 EU DIRECTIVE ESTABLISHING A RIGHT FOR END USERS TO MAKE COPIES OF COPYRIGHTED WORKS FOR PERSONAL OR PRIVATE USE, BUT ALSO ALLOWING THE COLLECTION OF LEVIES BASED UPON SALES OF BLANK MEDIA OR RECORDING DEVICES TO COMPENSATE COPYRIGHT

HOLDERS FOR PRIVATE COPYING. VARIOUS COLLECTING SOCIETIES IN EU COUNTRIES INITIATED LITIGATION AGAINST NOKIA, STATING THAT NOKIA MUST PAY LEVIES NOT ONLY BASED UPON SALES OF BLANK MEMORY CARDS, BUT ALSO PHONES THAT INCLUDE BLANK MEMORY FOR DATA

STORAGE ON THE PHONES, REGARDLESS OF ACTUAL USAGE OF THAT MEMORY. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT CASES AGAINST NOKIA ARE PENDING IN GERMANY AND AUSTRIA, DUE TO BOTH HIGH VOLUME OF SALES AND HIGH LEVY AMOUNTS SOUGHT IN THESE COUNTRIES. WE ARE

LITIGATING AGAINST CERTAIN COLLECTING SOCIETIES ON THE BASIS THAT THE LEVY SCHEMES EXCEED WHAT THE EU DIRECTIVE AND EUROPEAN COURT OF JUSTICE DECISIONS PERMIT.

OTHER PATENT AND INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CLAIMS

IN ADDITION TO THESE CASES, THERE ARE

APPROXIMATELY 90 OTHER PATENT INFRINGEMENT CASES PENDING AGAINST MICROSOFT.

PRODUCT-RELATED LITIGATION

U.S. CELL PHONE LITIGATION

NOKIA, ALONG WITH OTHER HANDSET MANUFACTURERS AND NETWORK

OPERATORS, IS A DEFENDANT IN 19 LAWSUITS FILED IN THE SUPERIOR COURT FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BY INDIVIDUAL PLAINTIFFS WHO ALLEGE THAT RADIO EMISSIONS FROM CELLULAR HANDSETS CAUSED THEIR BRAIN TUMORS AND OTHER ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECTS. WE HAVE

ASSUMED RESPONSIBILITY FOR THESE CLAIMS AS PART OF THE NDS ACQUISITION. NINE OF THESE CASES WERE FILED IN 2002 AND ARE CONSOLIDATED FOR CERTAIN PRE-TRIAL PROCEEDINGS; THE REMAINING TEN CASES ARE STAYED. IN A SEPARATE 2009 DECISION, THE COURT OF

APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA HELD THAT ADVERSE HEALTH EFFECT CLAIMS ARISING FROM THE USE OF CELLULAR HANDSETS THAT OPERATE WITHIN THE U.S. FEDERAL COMMUNICATIONS COMMISSION RADIO FREQUENCY EMISSION GUIDELINES (FCC GUIDELINES) ARE

PRE-EMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW. THE PLAINTIFFS ALLEGE THAT THEIR HANDSETS EITHER OPERATED OUTSIDE THE FCC GUIDELINES OR WERE MANUFACTURED BEFORE THE FCC GUIDELINES WENT INTO EFFECT. THE LAWSUITS ALSO ALLEGE AN INDUSTRY-WIDE CONSPIRACY TO MANIPULATE THE

SCIENCE AND TESTING AROUND EMISSION GUIDELINES. IN SEPTEMBER 2013, DEFENDANTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED CASES MOVED TO EXCLUDE PLAINTIFFS EXPERT EVIDENCE OF GENERAL CAUSATION ON THE BASIS OF FLAWED SCIENTIFIC METHODOLOGIES. THE MOTION WAS HEARD IN

DECEMBER 2013 AND JANUARY 2014. IN MARCH 2014, DEFENDANTS FILED A SEPARATE MOTION TO PRECLUDE PLAINTIFFS GENERAL CAUSATION TESTIMONY ON THE GROUND THAT IT IS PRE-EMPTED BY FEDERAL LAW BECAUSE THE EXPERTS CHALLENGE THE SAFETY OF ALL CELLULAR

HANDSETS, INCLUDING THOSE THAT COMPLY WITH THE FCC GUIDELINES. BOTH MOTIONS ARE PENDING.

CANADIAN CELL PHONE CLASS ACTION

NOKIA, ALONG WITH OTHER HANDSET MANUFACTURERS AND NETWORK OPERATORS, IS A DEFENDANT IN A 2013 CLASS ACTION LAWSUIT FILED IN THE SUPREME COURT OF

BRITISH COLUMBIA BY A PURPORTED CLASS OF CANADIANS WHO HAVE USED CELLULAR PHONES FOR AT LEAST 1600 HOURS, INCLUDING A SUBCLASS OF USERS WITH BRAIN TUMORS. MICROSOFT WAS SERVED WITH THE COMPLAINT IN JUNE 2014. THE LITIGATION IS NOT YET ACTIVE AS

SEVERAL DEFENDANTS REMAIN TO BE SERVED.

OTHER

WE ALSO ARE SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF OTHER CLAIMS AND SUITS THAT ARISE FROM TIME TO TIME IN THE ORDINARY COURSE OF OUR BUSINESS. ALTHOUGH MANAGEMENT CURRENTLY BELIEVES THAT RESOLVING CLAIMS AGAINST US, INDIVIDUALLY

OR IN AGGREGATE, WILL NOT HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THESE MATTERS ARE SUBJECT TO INHERENT UNCERTAINTIES AND MANAGEMENTS VIEW OF THESE MATTERS MAY CHANGE IN THE FUTURE.

AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, WE HAD ACCRUED AGGREGATE LIABILITIES OF $780 MILLION IN OTHER CURRENT LIABILITIES AND $81 MILLION IN OTHER LONG-TERM

LIABILITIES FOR ALL OF OUR LEGAL MATTERS THAT WERE CONTINGENCIES AS OF THAT DATE. WHILE WE INTEND TO DEFEND THESE MATTERS VIGOROUSLY, ADVERSE OUTCOMES THAT WE ESTIMATE COULD REACH APPROXIMATELY $2.0 BILLION IN AGGREGATE BEYOND RECORDED AMOUNTS ARE

REASONABLY POSSIBLE. WERE UNFAVORABLE FINAL OUTCOMES TO OCCUR, THERE EXISTS THE POSSIBILITY OF A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON OUR CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR THE PERIOD IN WHICH THE EFFECTS BECOME REASONABLY ESTIMABLE. SUBSTANTIALLY ALL

CHANGES FROM THE PRIOR QUARTER IN THESE ACCRUALS AND ESTIMATES ARE ATTRIBUTABLE TO MATTERS INVOLVING NOKIA THAT WE ASSUMED AS A RESULT OF THE NDS ACQUISITION.

UNDER THE SUPERVISION AND

WITH THE PARTICIPATION OF OUR MANAGEMENT, INCLUDING THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER, WE HAVE EVALUATED THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES AS REQUIRED BY EXCHANGE ACT RULE 13A-15(B) AS OF THE END OF

THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS REPORT. BASED ON THAT EVALUATION, THE CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER AND CHIEF FINANCIAL OFFICER HAVE CONCLUDED THAT THESE DISCLOSURE CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES ARE EFFECTIVE.

REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING

OUR MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ESTABLISHING AND MAINTAINING ADEQUATE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR THE COMPANY. INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF OUR FINANCIAL REPORTING FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA. INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES MAINTAINING RECORDS THAT IN REASONABLE DETAIL ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT OUR TRANSACTIONS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS NECESSARY FOR PREPARATION OF OUR FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS; PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF COMPANY ASSETS ARE MADE IN ACCORDANCE WITH MANAGEMENT AUTHORIZATION; AND PROVIDING REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE OR DISPOSITION OF COMPANY ASSETS

THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. BECAUSE OF ITS INHERENT LIMITATIONS, INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS NOT INTENDED TO PROVIDE ABSOLUTE ASSURANCE THAT A

MISSTATEMENT OF OUR FINANCIAL STATEMENTS WOULD BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED.

MANAGEMENT CONDUCTED AN EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF OUR

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON THE FRAMEWORK IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. OUR ASSESSMENT OF, AND CONCLUSION ON,

THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DID NOT INCLUDE THE INTERNAL CONTROLS OF NOKIA CORPORATIONS DEVICES AND SERVICES BUSINESS, ACQUIRED ON APRIL 25, 2014, WHICH IS INCLUDED IN OUR 2014 CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AND REPRESENTED APPROXIMATELY 9% OF OUR TOTAL ASSETS AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, AND 2% OF OUR TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2014. BASED ON THIS EVALUATION, MANAGEMENT CONCLUDED THAT THE COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL

OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS EFFECTIVE AS OF JUNE 30, 2014. THERE WERE NO CHANGES IN OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING DURING THE QUARTER ENDED JUNE 30, 2014 THAT HAVE MATERIALLY AFFECTED, OR ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO MATERIALLY

AFFECT, OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. DELOITTE & TOUCHE LLP HAS AUDITED OUR INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2014; THEIR REPORT IS INCLUDED IN ITEM 9A.

ITEM 9A

REPORT OF INDEPENDENT REGISTERED PUBLIC ACCOUNTING FIRM

TO THE BOARD OF DIRECTORS AND STOCKHOLDERS OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION

REDMOND, WASHINGTON

WE HAVE AUDITED THE INTERNAL

CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING OF MICROSOFT CORPORATION AND SUBSIDIARIES (THE COMPANY) AS OF JUNE 30, 2014, BASED ON CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE

OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION. AS DESCRIBED IN THE REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, MANAGEMENT EXCLUDED FROM ITS ASSESSMENT THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AT NOKIA

CORPORATIONS DEVICES AND SERVICES BUSINESS, ACQUIRED ON APRIL 25, 2014 AND WHOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS CONSTITUTE 9% OF TOTAL ASSETS AS OF JUNE 30, 2014 AND 2% OF TOTAL REVENUES FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2014. ACCORDINGLY, OUR

AUDIT DID NOT INCLUDE THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AT NOKIA CORPORATIONS DEVICES AND SERVICES BUSINESS. THE COMPANYS MANAGEMENT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR MAINTAINING EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AND FOR

ITS ASSESSMENT OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDED IN THE ACCOMPANYING REPORT OF MANAGEMENT ON INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING. OUR RESPONSIBILITY IS TO EXPRESS AN OPINION ON THE COMPANYS

INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING BASED ON OUR AUDIT.

WE CONDUCTED OUR AUDIT IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC

COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES). THOSE STANDARDS REQUIRE THAT WE PLAN AND PERFORM THE AUDIT TO OBTAIN REASONABLE ASSURANCE ABOUT WHETHER EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING WAS MAINTAINED IN ALL MATERIAL

RESPECTS. OUR AUDIT INCLUDED OBTAINING AN UNDERSTANDING OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, ASSESSING THE RISK THAT A MATERIAL WEAKNESS EXISTS, TESTING AND EVALUATING THE DESIGN AND OPERATING EFFECTIVENESS OF INTERNAL CONTROL BASED ON

THE ASSESSED RISK, AND PERFORMING SUCH OTHER PROCEDURES AS WE CONSIDERED NECESSARY IN THE CIRCUMSTANCES. WE BELIEVE THAT OUR AUDIT PROVIDES A REASONABLE BASIS FOR OUR OPINION.

A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING IS A PROCESS DESIGNED BY, OR UNDER THE SUPERVISION OF, THE COMPANYS PRINCIPAL

EXECUTIVE AND PRINCIPAL FINANCIAL OFFICERS, OR PERSONS PERFORMING SIMILAR FUNCTIONS, AND EFFECTED BY THE COMPANYS BOARD OF DIRECTORS, MANAGEMENT, AND OTHER PERSONNEL TO PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING THE RELIABILITY OF FINANCIAL

REPORTING AND THE PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS FOR EXTERNAL PURPOSES IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. A COMPANYS INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING INCLUDES THOSE POLICIES AND PROCEDURES THAT

(1) PERTAIN TO THE MAINTENANCE OF RECORDS THAT, IN REASONABLE DETAIL, ACCURATELY AND FAIRLY REFLECT THE TRANSACTIONS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE ASSETS OF THE COMPANY; (2) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE THAT TRANSACTIONS ARE RECORDED AS

NECESSARY TO PERMIT PREPARATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES, AND THAT RECEIPTS AND EXPENDITURES OF THE COMPANY ARE BEING MADE ONLY IN ACCORDANCE WITH AUTHORIZATIONS OF MANAGEMENT AND DIRECTORS

OF THE COMPANY; AND (3) PROVIDE REASONABLE ASSURANCE REGARDING PREVENTION OR TIMELY DETECTION OF UNAUTHORIZED ACQUISITION, USE, OR DISPOSITION OF THE COMPANYS ASSETS THAT COULD HAVE A MATERIAL EFFECT ON THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.

BECAUSE OF THE INHERENT LIMITATIONS OF INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING, INCLUDING THE POSSIBILITY OF COLLUSION OR IMPROPER

MANAGEMENT OVERRIDE OF CONTROLS, MATERIAL MISSTATEMENTS DUE TO ERROR OR FRAUD MAY NOT BE PREVENTED OR DETECTED ON A TIMELY BASIS. ALSO, PROJECTIONS OF ANY EVALUATION OF THE EFFECTIVENESS OF THE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING TO

FUTURE PERIODS ARE SUBJECT TO THE RISK THAT THE CONTROLS MAY BECOME INADEQUATE BECAUSE OF CHANGES IN CONDITIONS, OR THAT THE DEGREE OF COMPLIANCE WITH THE POLICIES OR PROCEDURES MAY DETERIORATE.

IN OUR OPINION, THE COMPANY MAINTAINED, IN ALL MATERIAL RESPECTS, EFFECTIVE INTERNAL CONTROL OVER FINANCIAL REPORTING AS OF JUNE 30, 2014,

BASED ON THE CRITERIA ESTABLISHED IN

INTERNAL CONTROL  INTEGRATED FRAMEWORK (2013)

ISSUED BY THE COMMITTEE OF SPONSORING ORGANIZATIONS OF THE TREADWAY COMMISSION.

WE HAVE ALSO AUDITED, IN ACCORDANCE WITH THE STANDARDS OF THE PUBLIC COMPANY ACCOUNTING OVERSIGHT BOARD (UNITED STATES), THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL

STATEMENTS AS OF AND FOR THE YEAR ENDED JUNE 30, 2014, OF THE COMPANY AND OUR REPORT DATED JULY 31, 2014, EXPRESSED AN UNQUALIFIED OPINION ON THOSE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS.
