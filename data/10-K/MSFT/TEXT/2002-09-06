PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

DURING FISCAL YEARS 2000, 2001, AND 2002, RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE WAS $3.77 BILLION, $4.38 BILLION, AND $4.31 BILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THOSE AMOUNTS REPRESENTED 16.4%, 17.3%, AND 15.2%,

RESPECTIVELY, OF REVENUE IN EACH OF THOSE YEARS. IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

THE AMORTIZATION OF GOODWILL WAS DISCONTINUED IN FISCAL 2002. THE AMOUNT OF

GOODWILL AMORTIZATION INCLUDED IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT EXPENSE IN FISCAL YEARS 2000 AND 2001 WAS $232 MILLION AND $272 MILLION, RESPECTIVELY. THE COMPANY PLANS TO CONTINUE SIGNIFICANT EXPENDITURES FOR RESEARCH AND PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT.

MOST OF THE COMPANYS SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE DEVELOPED INTERNALLY. THE COMPANY ALSO PURCHASES TECHNOLOGY, LICENSES INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, AND OVERSEES

THIRD-PARTY DEVELOPMENT AND LOCALIZATION OF CERTAIN PRODUCTS. INTERNAL DEVELOPMENT ALLOWS MICROSOFT TO MAINTAIN CLOSER TECHNICAL CONTROL OVER ITS PRODUCTS AND GIVES THE COMPANY THE FREEDOM TO DESIGNATE WHICH MODIFICATIONS AND ENHANCEMENTS ARE MOST

IMPORTANT AND WHEN THEY SHOULD BE IMPLEMENTED. MICROSOFT WORKS ON DEVISING INNOVATIVE SOLUTIONS TO COMPUTER SCIENCE PROBLEMS, SUCH AS MAKING COMPUTERS EASIER TO USE, DESIGNING SOFTWARE FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF HARDWARE, IMPROVING THE SOFTWARE

DESIGN PROCESS, AND INVESTIGATING THE MATHEMATICAL UNDERPINNINGS OF COMPUTER SCIENCE. THE COMPANY HAS CREATED A SUBSTANTIAL BODY OF PROPRIETARY DEVELOPMENT TOOLS AND HAS EVOLVED DEVELOPMENT METHODOLOGIES FOR CREATING AND ENHANCING ITS PRODUCTS.

THESE TOOLS AND METHODOLOGIES ARE ALSO DESIGNED TO SIMPLIFY A PRODUCTS PORTABILITY AMONG DIFFERENT OPERATING SYSTEMS, MICROPROCESSORS, OR COMPUTING DEVICES. PRODUCT DOCUMENTATION IS GENERALLY CREATED INTERNALLY. THE COMPANY STRIVES TO BECOME

INFORMED AT THE EARLIEST POSSIBLE TIME ABOUT CHANGING USAGE PATTERNS AND HARDWARE ADVANCES THAT MAY AFFECT SOFTWARE DESIGN. BEFORE RELEASING NEW SOFTWARE PLATFORMS, MICROSOFT PROVIDES TO SOFTWARE VENDORS A RANGE OF DEVELOPMENT, TRAINING, TESTING

RESOURCES, AND GUIDELINES FOR DEVELOPING APPLICATIONS.

THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY IS CHARACTERIZED BY RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, WHICH REQUIRES CONSTANT ATTENTION TO

COMPUTING TECHNOLOGY TRENDS, SHIFTING CONSUMER DEMAND, AND RAPID PRODUCT INNOVATION. THE PACE OF CHANGE IS ACCELERATING AS THE COMPUTING NEEDS OF OUR CUSTOMERS MOVE BEYOND THE PC TOWARD INTELLIGENT DEVICES AND APPLIANCES, SUCH AS THE TABLET PC.

TABLET PCS EXTEND THE POWER OF LAPTOP COMPUTERS RUNNING WINDOWS XP WITH ENHANCED CAPABILITIES SUCH AS HANDWRITING AND SPEECH INPUT.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT

MAKING ITS PRODUCTS TRUSTWORTHY IS CRITICAL TO THEIR SUCCESS AND HAS LAUNCHED A COMPANY-WIDE EFFORT CALLED TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING. TRUSTWORTHY COMPUTING HAS FOUR PILLARS: RELIABILITY, SECURITY, PRIVACY, AND BUSINESS INTEGRITY. RELIABILITY MEANS THAT

A COMPUTER SYSTEM IS DEPENDABLE, IS AVAILABLE WHEN NEEDED, AND PERFORMS AS EXPECTED AND AT APPROPRIATE LEVELS. SECURITY MEANS THAT A SYSTEM IS RESILIENT TO ATTACK, AND THAT THE CONFIDENTIALITY, INTEGRITY AND AVAILABILITY OF BOTH THE SYSTEM AND ITS

DATA ARE PROTECTED. PRIVACY MEANS THAT INDIVIDUALS HAVE THE ABILITY TO CONTROL DATA ABOUT THEMSELVES AND THAT THOSE USING SUCH DATA FAITHFULLY ADHERE TO FAIR INFORMATION PRINCIPLES. BUSINESS INTEGRITY, IN THIS CONTEXT, IS ABOUT BEING RESPONSIBLE TO

CUSTOMERS AND HELPING THEM FIND APPROPRIATE SOLUTIONS FOR THEIR BUSINESS ISSUES, ADDRESSING PROBLEMS WITH PRODUCTS OR SERVICES, AND BEING OPEN IN INTERACTIONS WITH CUSTOMERS. WHILE THE COMPANY IS CONTINUING TO INVEST SIGNIFICANTLY IN DELIVERING NEW

CAPABILITIES THAT CUSTOMERS ASK FOR, MICROSOFT IS MAKING SECURITY IMPROVEMENTS A HIGH PRIORITY.

MICROSOFT .NET IS MICROSOFTS PLATFORM FOR XML WEB SERVICES.

XML WEB SERVICES ALLOW APPLICATIONS TO COMMUNICATE AND SHARE DATA OVER THE INTERNET OR AN INTRANET, REGARDLESS OF OPERATING SYSTEM OR PROGRAMMING LANGUAGE. THE MICROSOFT .NET PLATFORM INCLUDES A COMPREHENSIVE FAMILY OF PRODUCTS, BUILT ON XML AND

OTHER INTERNET INDUSTRY STANDARDS, WHICH PROVIDE FOR EACH ASPECT OF DEVELOPING, MANAGING, USING, AND EXPERIENCING XML WEB SERVICES. THERE ARE FIVE AREAS WHERE MICROSOFT IS BUILDING THE .NET PLATFORM TODAY: TOOLS, SERVERS, XML WEB  SERVICES,

CLIENTS, AND .NET EXPERIENCES. IN THE TOOLS AREA, VISUAL STUDIO .NET AND THE MICROSOFT .NET FRAMEWORK SUPPLY A COMPLETE SOLUTION FOR DEVELOPERS TO BUILD, DEPLOY, AND RUN XML WEB SERVICES. THEY MAXIMIZE THE PERFORMANCE, RELIABILITY, AND SECURITY OF

XML WEB SERVICES. THE .NET ENTERPRISE SERVERS, INCLUDING THE WINDOWS 2000 SERVER FAMILY, MAKE UP MICROSOFT .NETS SERVER INFRASTRUCTURE FOR DEPLOYING, MANAGING, AND ORCHESTRATING XML WEB SERVICES. DESIGNED WITH MISSION-CRITICAL PERFORMANCE IN

MIND, THEY PROVIDE ENTERPRISES WITH THE AGILITY THEY NEED TO INTEGRATE THEIR SYSTEMS, APPLICATIONS, AND PARTNERS THROUGH XML WEB SERVICES, AND THE FLEXIBILITY TO ADAPT TO CHANGING BUSINESS REQUIREMENTS. CLIENTS ARE PCS, LAPTOPS, WORKSTATIONS,

PHONES, HANDHELD COMPUTERS, TABLET PCS, GAME CONSOLES, AND OTHER SMART DEVICES. THESE SMART DEVICES USE SOFTWARE THAT SUPPORTS XML WEB SERVICES, WHICH ENABLE USERS TO ACCESS THEIR DATA REGARDLESS OF THE LOCATION, TYPE, AND NUMBER OF CLIENTS USED.

SMART CLIENTS AND DEVICES LEVERAGE XML WEB SERVICES TO CREATE .NET EXPERIENCES THAT ALLOW USERS TO ACCESS INFORMATION ACROSS THE INTERNET AND FROM STAND-ALONE APPLICATIONS IN AN INTEGRATED WAY.

TO BEST SERVE THE NEEDS OF USERS AROUND THE WORLD, MICROSOFT LOCALIZES MANY OF ITS PRODUCTS TO REFLECT LOCAL LANGUAGES AND CONVENTIONS AND TO IMPROVE THE QUALITY AND USABILITY OF THE PRODUCT IN

INTERNATIONAL MARKETS. LOCALIZING A PRODUCT MIGHT REQUIRE MODIFYING THE USER INTERFACE, ALTERING DIALOG BOXES, AND TRANSLATING TEXT. IN JAPANESE VERSIONS, FOR EXAMPLE, ALL USER MESSAGES AND DOCUMENTATION ARE IN JAPANESE WITH MONETARY REFERENCES IN

THE JAPANESE YEN. VARIOUS MICROSOFT PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN LOCALIZED INTO MORE THAN 30 LANGUAGES.

MANUFACTURING

MICROSOFT CONTRACTS OUT MOST OF ITS MANUFACTURING ACTIVITIES TO THIRD PARTIES. OUTSIDE MANUFACTURERS PRODUCE THE XBOX, VARIOUS RETAIL SOFTWARE PACKAGED

PRODUCTS, AND HARDWARE. THERE ARE OTHER CUSTOM MANUFACTURERS MICROSOFT COULD USE IN THE EVENT OUTSOURCED MANUFACTURING BECOMES UNAVAILABLE FROM CURRENT VENDORS. THE COMPANY GENERALLY HAS MULTIPLE SOURCES FOR RAW MATERIALS, SUPPLIES, AND COMPONENTS

AND IS OFTEN ABLE TO ACQUIRE COMPONENT PARTS AND MATERIALS ON A VOLUME DISCOUNT BASIS. THE GRAPHICS PROCESSING UNIT (GPU) FOR THE XBOX WAS CUSTOM DESIGNED AND IS PRODUCED BY NVIDIA CORPORATION. QUALITY CONTROL TESTS ARE PERFORMED ON PURCHASED PARTS,

CD-ROMS, AND OTHER PRODUCTS.

COMMITMENT. THE AGREEMENTS ARE DESIGNED TO SIMPLIFY LICENSE ADMINISTRATION, PAYMENT TERMS, AND THE CONTRACT PROCESS. THE MICROSOFT SELECT PROGRAM OFFERS FLEXIBLE SOFTWARE ACQUISITION, LICENSING, AND MAINTENANCE OPTIONS SPECIALLY CUSTOMIZED TO MEET

COMPETITION

THE SOFTWARE BUSINESS IS INTENSELY COMPETITIVE AND SUBJECT TO RAPID TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE. AS THE COMPANY PURSUES ITS LARGEST STRATEGIC INITIATIVE, MICROSOFT .NET, THE COMPANY COULD EXPERIENCE MORE INTENSE

COMPETITION DURING THE TRANSITION FROM THE TRADITIONAL CORE BUSINESSES TO ITS NEW PRODUCTS BASED ON THE .NET ARCHITECTURE. THE COMPANY CONTINUES TO FACE MOVEMENT FROM PC-BASED APPLICATIONS TO SERVER-BASED APPLICATIONS OR WEB-BASED APPLICATION

HOSTING SERVICES, FROM PROPRIETARY SOFTWARE TO OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE SUCH AS THE LINUX OPERATING SYSTEM, AND FROM PCS TO INTERNET-BASED DEVICES. A NUMBER OF MICROSOFTS MOST SIGNIFICANT COMPETITORS, INCLUDING IBM, SUN MICROSYSTEMS,  ORACLE,

AND AOL-TIME WARNER, ARE COLLABORATING WITH ONE ANOTHER ON VARIOUS INITIATIVES DIRECTED AT COMPETING WITH MICROSOFT. THESE INITIATIVES RELATE IN PART TO EFFORTS TO MOVE SOFTWARE FROM INDIVIDUAL PCS TO CENTRALLY MANAGED SERVERS, WHICH WOULD PRESENT

SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGES TO THE COMPANYS HISTORICAL BUSINESS MODEL. OTHER COMPETITIVE COLLABORATIVE EFFORTS INCLUDE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW PLATFORM TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE INTENDED TO REPLICATE MUCH OF THE VALUE OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATING

SYSTEMS. NEW COMPUTING FORM FACTORS, INCLUDING NON-PC INFORMATION DEVICES, ARE GAINING POPULARITY AND COMPETING WITH PCS RUNNING MICROSOFTS SOFTWARE PRODUCTS.

MICROSOFT FACES FORMIDABLE COMPETITION IN THESE NEW AREAS AND IN ALL AREAS OF ITS CURRENT BUSINESS ACTIVITIES. THE RAPID PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE, PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF INTERNET PLATFORMS AND SERVICES, CONTINUALLY CREATES

NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR EXISTING COMPETITORS AND START-UPS AND CAN QUICKLY RENDER EXISTING TECHNOLOGIES LESS VALUABLE. GLOBAL SOFTWARE PIRACYTHE UNLAWFUL COPYING AND DISTRIBUTION OF  MICROSOFTS COPYRIGHTED SOFTWARE

PRODUCTSDEPRIVES THE COMPANY OF LARGE AMOUNTS OF REVENUE ON AN ANNUAL BASIS.

THE COMPANYS COMPETITIVE POSITION MAY BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED IN THE FUTURE

BY ONE OR MORE OF THE FACTORS DESCRIBED IN THIS SECTION, PARTICULARLY IN VIEW OF THE FAST PACE OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE IN THE COMPUTING INDUSTRY.

DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES

THE COMPANYS COMPETITORS INCLUDE MANY SOFTWARE APPLICATION VENDORS, SUCH

AS IBM, ORACLE, APPLE, SUN MICROSYSTEMS, COREL, QUALCOMM, AND LOCAL APPLICATION DEVELOPERS IN EUROPE AND ASIA. IBM AND COREL HAVE LARGE INSTALLED BASES WITH THEIR SPREADSHEET AND WORD PROCESSOR PRODUCTS, RESPECTIVELY, AND BOTH HAVE AGGRESSIVE

PRICING STRATEGIES. ALSO, IBM AND APPLE PREINSTALL CERTAIN OF THEIR APPLICATION SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ON VARIOUS MODELS OF THEIR PCS, COMPETING DIRECTLY WITH MICROSOFTS DESKTOP APPLICATION SOFTWARE. SUN MICROSYSTEMS STAR OFFICE IS

AGGRESSIVELY PRICED. ADDITIONALLY, WEB-BASED APPLICATION HOSTING SERVICES PROVIDE AN ALTERNATIVE TO PC-BASED APPLICATIONS SUCH AS MICROSOFT OFFICE.

MICROSOFTS PC AND SERVER OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCTS FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM A WIDE VARIETY OF COMPANIES. COMPETITORS SUCH AS IBM, APPLE COMPUTER, SUN MICROSYSTEMS, AND OTHERS ARE VERTICALLY INTEGRATED IN BOTH SOFTWARE

DEVELOPMENT AND HARDWARE MANUFACTURING AND HAVE DEVELOPED OPERATING SYSTEMS THAT THEY PREINSTALL ON THEIR OWN COMPUTERS. MANY OF THESE OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE PRODUCTS ARE ALSO LICENSED TO THIRD-PARTY OEMS FOR PREINSTALLATION ON THEIR COMPUTERS.

MICROSOFTS OPERATING SYSTEM PRODUCTS COMPETE WITH UNIX-BASED OPERATING SYSTEMS FROM A WIDE RANGE OF COMPANIES, INCLUDING IBM, HEWLETT-PACKARD, SUN MICROSYSTEMS, AND OTHERS. VARIANTS OF UNIX RUN ON A WIDE VARIETY OF COMPUTER PLATFORMS AND HAVE

GAINED INCREASING ACCEPTANCE AS DESKTOP OPERATING SYSTEMS. THE LINUX OPEN SOURCE OPERATING SYSTEM HAS GAINED INCREASING ACCEPTANCE AS WELL. SEVERAL COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS PREINSTALL LINUX ON PC SERVERS AND MANY LEADING SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS HAVE

WRITTEN APPLICATIONS THAT RUN ON LINUX. MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS ALSO FACE COMPETITION FROM ALTERNATIVE PLATFORMS SUCH AS THOSE BASED ON INTERNET BROWSING SOFTWARE AND JAVA TECHNOLOGY PROMOTED BY AOL-TIME WARNER AND SUN

MICROSYSTEMS.

THE COMPANY COMPETES IN THE BUSINESS OF PROVIDING ENTERPRISE-WIDE COMPUTING SOLUTIONS WITH SEVERAL COMPETITORS WHO ENJOY A LARGER SHARE OF

SALES AND LARGER INSTALLED BASES. MANY COMPANIES OFFER OPERATING SYSTEM SOFTWARE FOR MAINFRAMES AND MIDRANGE COMPUTERS, INCLUDING IBM, HP, AND SUN MICROSYSTEMS. SINCE LEGACY BUSINESS SYSTEMS ARE TYPICALLY SUPPORT-INTENSIVE, THESE COMPETITORS ALSO

OFFER SUBSTANTIAL SUPPORT SERVICES. SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS THAT PROVIDE COMPETING SERVER APPLICATIONS FOR PC-BASED DISTRIBUTED CLIENT/SERVER ENVIRONMENTS INCLUDE ORACLE, IBM, COMPUTER ASSOCIATES, SYBASE, AND INFORMIX. THERE ARE ALSO SEVERAL SOFTWARE

VENDORS WHO OFFER CONNECTIVITY SERVERS. AS MENTIONED ABOVE, THERE ARE NUMEROUS COMPANIES AND ORGANIZATIONS THAT OFFER INTERNET AND INTRANET SERVER SOFTWARE, WHICH COMPETE AGAINST THE COMPANYS BUSINESS SYSTEMS. ADDITIONALLY, IBM HAS A LARGE

INSTALLED BASE OF LOTUS NOTES AND CC:MAIL, BOTH OF WHICH COMPETE WITH THE COMPANYS COLLABORATION AND E-MAIL PRODUCTS.

THE COMPANYS DEVELOPER PRODUCTS

COMPETE AGAINST OFFERINGS FROM BEA SYSTEMS, BORLAND, IBM, MACROMEDIA, ORACLE, SUN MICROSYSTEMS, SYBASE, AND OTHER COMPANIES.

CONSUMER SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES

MICROSOFTS ONLINE SERVICES NETWORK, MSN, FACES FORMIDABLE COMPETITION FROM

AOL-TIME WARNER, YAHOO!, AND A VAST ARRAY OF WEB SITES AND PORTALS THAT OFFER CONTENT OF ALL TYPES AND E-MAIL, INSTANT MESSAGING, CALENDARING, CHAT, AND SEARCH AND SHOPPING SERVICES, AMONG OTHER THINGS.

XBOX COMPETES HEAD-TO-HEAD AGAINST GAME SYSTEMS FROM NINTENDO AND SONY, BOTH OF WHICH HAVE A LARGE ESTABLISHED BASE OF GAME SYSTEM USERS. GAME DEVELOPERS LIKE ACTIVISION, CAPCOM,

ELECTRONIC ARTS, SEGA, TECMO, AND THQ, TO NAME A FEW, ARE BOTH PARTNERS AND  COMPETITORS.

MICROSOFT FACES MANY COMPETITORS IN THE MOBILE DEVICES SPACE,

INCLUDING PALM, SYMBIAN, NOKIA, AND OPENWAVE. THE EMBEDDED OPERATING SYSTEM MARKET IS HIGHLY FRAGMENTED WITH MANY COMPETITIVE OFFERINGS. KEY COMPETITORS INCLUDE WIND RIVER AND VERSIONS OF EMBEDDABLE LINUX FROM COMMERCIAL LINUX VENDORS SUCH AS RED

HAT, LINEO, AND MONTAVISTA.

CONSUMER COMMERCE INVESTMENTS

MICROSOFT FACES MANY COMPETITORS IN THE ONLINE REAL ESTATE AND ONLINE AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE SPACES, INCLUDING HOMESTORE, AOLS HOUSE AND HOME CHANNEL, AUTOBYTEL, AOL

AUTOS, AND YAHOO! AUTOS.

OTHER

PC INPUT DEVICES FACE SUBSTANTIAL COMPETITION FROM COMPUTER MANUFACTURERS, SINCE COMPUTERS ARE TYPICALLY SOLD WITH A KEYBOARD AND MOUSE, AND OTHER MANUFACTURERS OF THESE DEVICES. MICROSOFT PRESS COMPETES IN THE RETAIL BOOK AND

ELEARNING MARKETS WITH PUBLISHERS THAT ALSO CREATE CONTENT ON MICROSOFT TECHNOLOGIES. A FEW OF THE RETAIL COMPETITORS ARE PEARSON, WROX, SYBEX, AND WILEY. THE MAJOR ELEARNING COMPETITORS ARE SMARTFORCE AND NETG.

EMPLOYEES

AS OF JUNE 30, 2002, THE COMPANY

EMPLOYED APPROXIMATELY 50,500 PEOPLE ON A FULL-TIME BASIS, 34,600 IN THE UNITED STATES AND 15,900 INTERNATIONALLY. OF THE TOTAL, 20,800 WERE IN PRODUCT RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, 23,500 IN SALES, MARKETING, AND SUPPORT, 2,200 IN MANUFACTURING AND

DISTRIBUTION, AND 4,000 IN FINANCE AND ADMINISTRATION. MICROSOFTS SUCCESS IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON ITS ABILITY TO ATTRACT AND RETAIN QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES. COMPETITION FOR EMPLOYEES IS INTENSE IN THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY. TO DATE, THE COMPANY

BELIEVES IT HAS BEEN SUCCESSFUL IN ITS EFFORTS TO RECRUIT QUALIFIED EMPLOYEES, BUT THERE IS NO ASSURANCE THAT IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE AS SUCCESSFUL IN THE FUTURE. NONE OF THE COMPANYS EMPLOYEES ARE SUBJECT TO COLLECTIVE BARGAINING AGREEMENTS.

THE COMPANY BELIEVES RELATIONS WITH ITS EMPLOYEES ARE  EXCELLENT.

ITEM 2.    PROPERTIES

THE COMPANYS CORPORATE OFFICES CONSIST OF APPROXIMATELY 8.4 MILLION

REVENUE

THE COMPANYS REVENUE GROWTH RATE WAS 16% IN FISCAL 2000, 10% IN FISCAL 2001, AND 12% IN FISCAL 2002. REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2002 WAS LED BY THE ADDITION OF XBOX

VIDEO GAME SYSTEM REVENUE AND THE STRONG PENETRATION OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL AND HOME OPERATING SYSTEMS. REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2001 WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY LICENSING OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL, MICROSOFT SQL SERVER, AND

THE OTHER .NET ENTERPRISE SERVERS. REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2000 WAS DRIVEN BY STRONG LICENSING OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS NT WORKSTATION, WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL, WINDOWS NT SERVER, WINDOWS 2000 SERVER, MICROSOFT OFFICE 2000, AND SQL SERVER.

MICROSOFT CONTINUED TO SEE A MIX SHIFT TO VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS. ON OCTOBER 1, 2001, MICROSOFT LAUNCHED LICENSING 6.0 TO SIMPLIFY AND IMPROVE ITS VOLUME

LICENSING PROGRAMS, INCLUDING A SIMPLIFIED APPROACH TO SOFTWARE UPGRADES. ONE FEATURE OF LICENSING 6.0 IS SOFTWARE ASSURANCE WHICH GIVES CUSTOMERS THE RIGHT TO INSTALL ANY NEW RELEASE OF PRODUCTS COVERED IN THE LICENSING AGREEMENT DURING THE TERM OF

THEIR COVERAGE. THE SUCCESS OF MICROSOFTS NEW VOLUME LICENSING PROGRAMS WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE MIX OF MULTI-YEAR LICENSING AGREEMENTS WITH A RESULTING IMPACT ON THE TIMING OF REVENUE RECOGNITION. IN ADDITION, THE TIMING AND EXTENT OF A

RECOVERY IN CONSUMER AND CORPORATE SPENDING ON PCS AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (IT) WILL BE FACTORS AFFECTING REVENUE GROWTH.

PRODUCT REVENUE

IN FISCAL 2002, MICROSOFT HAD FOUR SEGMENTS: DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES; CONSUMER SOFTWARE,

SERVICES, AND DEVICES; CONSUMER COMMERCE INVESTMENTS; AND OTHER. THE REVENUE FIGURES IN THIS MANAGEMENTS DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS (MD&A) DIFFER FROM THOSE REPORTED IN THE COMPANYS SEGMENT INFORMATION APPEARING IN NOTE 20 OF THE NOTES

TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS. THE REVENUE FIGURES IN THE SEGMENT INFORMATION REPRESENT AMOUNTS REPORTED INTERNALLY FOR MANAGEMENT REPORTING, WHILE THE REVENUE FIGURES IN THE MD&A REFLECT REVENUE RECOGNIZED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES. ON JULY 1, 2002, MICROSOFT REVISED ITS PRODUCT SEGMENTS AND WILL BEGIN REPORTING THE NEW SEGMENTS IN FISCAL 2003.

DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES

.    DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES REVENUE WAS $20.40 BILLION, $22.41 BILLION, AND $24.01 BILLION IN 2000, 2001, AND 2002. DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE

SOFTWARE AND SERVICES INCLUDES DESKTOP APPLICATIONS; DESKTOP PLATFORMS; AND ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES.

DESKTOP APPLICATIONS REVENUE WAS $9.30 BILLION, $9.54

BILLION, AND $9.60 BILLION IN 2000, 2001, AND 2002. DESKTOP APPLICATIONS INCLUDES REVENUE FROM MICROSOFT OFFICE; MICROSOFT PROJECT; VISIO; CLIENT ACCESS LICENSES (CALS) FOR WINDOWS NT SERVER AND WINDOWS 2000 SERVER, EXCHANGE, AND BACKOFFICE;

MICROSOFT GREAT PLAINS; AND BCENTRAL. IN FISCAL 2002, OFFICE LICENSING REVENUE DECLINED DURING THE YEAR DUE TO A STRONG MIX SHIFT TO MULTI-YEAR ANNUITY LICENSING AGREEMENTS, WHICH DEFERRED REVENUE RECOGNITION TO FUTURE YEARS, AND A DECREASE IN

CONSUMER PURCHASES IN THE ASIA REGION, MOST NOTABLY JAPAN, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY STRONG OEM LICENSING. REVENUE FROM CLIENT ACCESS LICENSES GREW 3% IN FISCAL 2002 AND REVENUE FROM GREAT PLAINS CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH IN DESKTOP APPLICATIONS. IN

FISCAL 2001, REVENUE FROM CLIENT ACCESS LICENSES INCREASED 14% REFLECTING STRONG LICENSING GROWTH OF WINDOWS NT SERVER AND WINDOWS 2000 SERVER CALS. OFFICE REVENUE GROWTH WAS FLAT DURING FISCAL 2001. IN FISCAL 2000, REVENUE GROWTH FROM MICROSOFT

OFFICE INTEGRATED SUITES, INCLUDING THE PREMIUM, PROFESSIONAL, SMALL BUSINESS, AND STANDARD EDITIONS WAS VERY SOLID.

DESKTOP PLATFORMS REVENUE WAS $7.02 BILLION,

$8.04 BILLION, AND $9.30 BILLION IN 2000, 2001, AND 2002. DESKTOP PLATFORMS INCLUDES REVENUE FROM WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL AND HOME, WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL, WINDOWS NT WORKSTATION, WINDOWS ME, WINDOWS 98, AND OTHER DESKTOP OPERATING SYSTEMS. IN

FISCAL 2002, THE GROWTH IN DESKTOP PLATFORMS REVENUE REFLECTED STRONG MULTI-YEAR LICENSING REVENUE GROWTH AND A CONTINUED MIX SHIFT TO THE HIGHER PRICED WINDOWS 2000 AND WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL OPERATING SYSTEM THROUGH OEMS, DESPITE A DECLINE IN

REPORTED OEM UNIT SHIPMENTS. FISCAL 2001 REVENUE GROWTH REFLECTED THE STRONG ADOPTION OF WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL,  PARTIALLY OFFSET BY FLAT REVENUE GROWTH FROM WINDOWS ME AND WINDOWS 98 OPERATING SYSTEMS, REFLECTING THE SLOWDOWN IN CONSUMER

PC SHIPMENTS AND A HIGHER MIX OF WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL AND WINDOWS NT WORKSTATION. IN FISCAL 2000, DESKTOP PLATFORMS REVENUE GROWTH WAS MODEST DUE TO SOFT DEMAND FOR BUSINESS PCS DURING MOST OF THE YEAR; A SLOWDOWN IN SHIPMENTS IN ANTICIPATION

OF THE POST MID-YEAR AVAILABILITY OF WINDOWS 2000 OPERATING SYSTEMS; AND, AS EXPECTED, A LONGER BUSINESS MIGRATION CYCLE FOR THE NEWEST WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM OFFERINGS. THE RATE OF GROWTH IN PC SHIPMENTS AND THE MIX OF WINDOWS 2000 AND WINDOWS XP

PROFESSIONAL AS A PERCENTAGE OF ALL 32-BIT OPERATING SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT REVENUE GROWTH IN THE FUTURE.

ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES REVENUE WAS

$4.08 BILLION, $4.83 BILLION, AND $5.11 BILLION IN 2000, 2001, AND 2002. ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES INCLUDES SERVER PLATFORMS, SERVER APPLICATIONS, DEVELOPER TOOLS AND SERVICES, AND ENTERPRISE SERVICES. IN FISCAL 2002, SERVER APPLICATIONS,

INCLUDING MICROSOFT SQL SERVER AND .NET ENTERPRISE SERVERS, INCREASED 10% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001. SERVER PLATFORM REVENUE, WHICH INCLUDES WINDOWS 2000 SERVER AND WINDOWS NT SERVER OPERATING SYSTEMS, INCREASED 10% VERSUS FISCAL 2001 DRIVEN BY A

MODEST OVERALL INCREASE IN WINDOWS-BASED SERVER SHIPMENTS AND INCREASED DEPLOYMENT OF WINDOWS 2000 SERVER. ENTERPRISE SERVICES REVENUE, REPRESENTING CONSULTING AND PRODUCT SUPPORT SERVICES, WAS UP 17% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001, WHILE REVENUE FROM

DEVELOPER TOOLS AND SERVICES WAS DOWN 19% FROM FISCAL 2001. IN FISCAL 2001, SERVER APPLICATIONS REVENUE INCREASED 31% VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR AS A RESULT OF

THE CONTINUED ADOPTION OF MICROSOFTS .NET ENTERPRISE SERVER OFFERINGS. ENTERPRISE SERVICES REVENUE IN FISCAL 2001, WAS UP 34% COMPARED TO FISCAL 2000 AND SERVER PLATFORMS INCREASED 10%

WHILE REVENUE FROM DEVELOPER TOOLS AND SERVICES WAS FLAT. IN FISCAL 2000, SERVER PLATFORMS REVENUE GROWTH WAS PARTICULARLY STRONG LED BY INCREASED ADOPTION BY CUSTOMERS OF WINDOWS NT SERVER AND WINDOWS 2000 SERVER. REVENUE FROM SERVER APPLICATIONS

GREW STRONGLY IN FISCAL 2000, LARGELY DUE TO THE STRONG SUCCESS OF SQL SERVER 7.0, WHILE SOFTWARE DEVELOPER TOOLS AND SERVICES REVENUE DECLINED, DUE TO INCREASED SUITE LICENSING VERSUS STAND-ALONE LICENSES, AND THE LACK OF A RELEASE UPGRADE OF THE

VISUAL STUDIO DEVELOPMENT SYSTEM.

CONSUMER SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES.

CONSUMER SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES

REVENUE WAS $1.63 BILLION, $1.95 BILLION, AND $3.59 BILLION IN 2000, 2001, AND 2002. CONSUMER SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES INCLUDES THE XBOX VIDEO GAME SYSTEM; MSN INTERNET ACCESS; MSN NETWORK SERVICE; PC AND ONLINE GAMES; LEARNING AND

PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE; MOBILITY; AND EMBEDDED SYSTEMS. THE MAJORITY OF THE REVENUE GROWTH FROM FISCAL 2001 STEMMED FROM SALES OF THE XBOX VIDEO GAME SYSTEM RELEASED IN FISCAL 2002. MSN INTERNET ACCESS REVENUE INCREASED AS A RESULT OF BOTH A HIGHER

SUBSCRIBER BASE AND HIGHER AVERAGE REVENUE PER SUBSCRIBER DUE TO A REDUCTION IN PROMOTIONAL SUBSCRIBER PROGRAMS. REVENUE FROM MSN NETWORK SERVICES INCREASED DESPITE A DECLINING INTERNET ADVERTISING MARKET. REVENUE FROM EMBEDDED SYSTEMS IN FISCAL

2002 GREW NICELY, HOWEVER LEARNING AND PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE REVENUE AND PC AND ONLINE GAMES DECLINED COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001. IN FISCAL 2001, REVENUE FROM MSN NETWORK SERVICES GREW STRONGLY DESPITE A DECLINE IN THE ONLINE ADVERTISING MARKET. MSN

INTERNET ACCESS REVENUE ALSO GREW SOLIDLY FROM FISCAL 2000 AS A RESULT OF AN INCREASED SUBSCRIBER BASE, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY A DECLINE IN THE AVERAGE REVENUE PER SUBSCRIBER DUE TO A LARGER MIX OF SUBSCRIBERS CONTRACTED UNDER REBATE PROGRAMS. REVENUE

FROM EMBEDDED SYSTEMS GREW STRONGLY FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, WHILE LEARNING AND PRODUCTIVITY SOFTWARE REVENUE AND PC AND ONLINE GAMES REVENUE DECLINED, REFLECTING SOFTNESS IN THE OVERALL CONSUMER MARKET. IN FISCAL 2000, ONLINE REVENUE GROWTH WAS VERY

STRONG AND REFLECTED HIGHER SUBSCRIBER TOTALS, OFFSET BY LOWER NET PRICES FOR INTERNET ACCESS SUBSCRIPTIONS COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR. ADDITIONALLY, STRONG SALES OF ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE IN FISCAL 2000 PRODUCED ROBUST REVENUE GROWTH IN PC AND

ONLINE GAMES.

CONSUMER COMMERCE INVESTMENTS.

CONSUMER COMMERCE INVESTMENTS REVENUE WAS $182 MILLION, $299 MILLION,

AND $242 MILLION IN 2000, 2001, AND 2002. CONSUMER COMMERCE INVESTMENTS INCLUDE EXPEDIA, INC., THE HOMEADVISOR ONLINE REAL ESTATE SERVICE, AND THE CARPOINT ONLINE AUTOMOTIVE SERVICE. THE DECLINE IN REVENUE COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001 REFLECTS THE SALE

OF MICROSOFTS MAJORITY OWNERSHIP OF EXPEDIA, INC. TO USA NETWORKS, INC. ON FEBRUARY 4, 2002. ACQUISITIONS OF TRAVELSCAPE.COM AND VACATIONSPOT.COM BY EXPEDIA, INC., AND INCREASED PRODUCT OFFERINGS FROM EXPEDIA LED TO THE STRONG REVENUE GROWTH

IN FISCAL 2001. THE INCREASED OVERALL REACH OF ALL PROPERTIES LED TO THE STRONG REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2000.

OTHER.

OTHER REVENUE, WHICH PRIMARILY INCLUDES HARDWARE AND MICROSOFT PRESS, WAS $754 MILLION, $630 MILLION, AND $530 MILLION IN 2000, 2001, AND 2002. IN FISCAL 2002, CONTINUED DECLINES IN THE IT BOOK

AND CONSUMER MARKET LED TO A DECLINE IN MICROSOFT PRESS AND HARDWARE SALES. LOWER SALES OF GAMING DEVICES AND OTHER HARDWARE PERIPHERALS AS A RESULT OF WEAKNESS IN THE CONSUMER MARKET CAUSED THE DECLINE IN REVENUE IN FISCAL 2001. CONTINUED SUCCESS

OF THE COMPANYS NEW HARDWARE DEVICE OFFERINGS LED TO REVENUE GROWTH IN FISCAL 2000.

DISTRIBUTION CHANNELS

MICROSOFT DISTRIBUTES ITS PRODUCTS PRIMARILY THROUGH THE FOLLOWING CHANNELS: OEM; VOLUME LICENSING; ONLINE SERVICES AND PRODUCTS; AND DISTRIBUTORS AND

RETAILERS. OEM CHANNEL REVENUE REPRESENTS LICENSE FEES FROM ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS WHO PREINSTALL MICROSOFT PRODUCTS, PRIMARILY ON PCS. MICROSOFT HAS THREE MAJOR GEOGRAPHIC SALES AND MARKETING REGIONS: THE SOUTH PACIFIC AND AMERICAS

REGION; THE EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA REGION; AND THE ASIA REGION. SALES OF VOLUME LICENSES AND PACKAGED SOFTWARE PRODUCTS VIA THESE CHANNELS ARE PRIMARILY TO DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS.

OEM REVENUE WAS $7.01 BILLION IN 2000, $7.86 BILLION IN 2001, AND $9.00 BILLION IN 2002. IN FISCAL 2002, REPORTED LICENSES DECLINED COMPARED TO FISCAL 2001. HOWEVER, A STRONG INCREASE IN THE MIX OF THE HIGHER

PRICED WINDOWS 2000 AND WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL LICENSES, AND HEALTHY GROWTH IN DIRECT AND SYSTEM BUILDER OEMS LICENSES, LED TO HIGHER AVERAGE REVENUE PER LICENSE AND CONTRIBUTED TO THE OVERALL OEM REVENUE GROWTH OVER FISCAL 2001. IN FISCAL 2001,

WHILE TOTAL LICENSES WERE ALSO IMPACTED BY A SLOWDOWN IN PC SHIPMENTS, THE MIX OF THE HIGHER PRICED WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL AND WINDOWS NT WORKSTATION INCREASED SUBSTANTIALLY RESULTING IN HIGHER AVERAGE REVENUE PER LICENSE. A RELATIVELY LOW GROWTH

RATE IN FISCAL 2000 WAS DUE TO LOWER BUSINESS PC SHIPMENT GROWTH COMBINED WITH POST MID-YEAR AVAILABILITY OF WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL. AVERAGE EARNED REVENUE PER LICENSE ALSO DECLINED IN FISCAL 2000 COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, DUE IN PART TO A MIX

SHIFT TO THE LOWER-PRICED WINDOWS 98 OPERATING SYSTEM REFLECTING THE SOFTNESS IN DEMAND FOR BUSINESS PCS AND LOWER PRICES ON  OPERATING SYSTEMS LICENSED THROUGH CERTAIN OEM CHANNEL SECTORS.

SOUTH PACIFIC AND AMERICAS REGION REVENUE WAS $8.33 BILLION, $9.52 BILLION, AND $11.41 BILLION IN 2000, 2001, AND 2002. IN FISCAL 2002, THE MAJORITY OF THE REVENUE GROWTH WAS DRIVEN BY SALES OF THE XBOX VIDEO

GAME SYSTEM RELEASED DURING THE YEAR, AS WELL AS STRONG WINDOWS XP PROFESSIONAL LICENSING, MSN SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE, AND REVENUE FROM MICROSOFT GREAT PLAINS. IN FISCAL 2001, REVENUE GROWTH WAS LED BY STRONG LICENSING OF WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL AND

THE FAMILY OF .NET ENTERPRISE SERVERS, PARTICULARLY SQL SERVER 2000 AND EXCHANGE 2000 SERVER. REVENUE FROM ENTERPRISE SERVICES AND MSN SUBSCRIPTION AND SERVICES ALSO GREW STRONGLY IN FISCAL 2001. IN FISCAL 2000, OFFICE 2000 INTEGRATED SUITES,

WINDOWS 2000 SERVER, ONLINE REVENUE, AND SQL SERVER SALES WERE THE PRIMARY DRIVERS OF THE REVENUE GROWTH. STRONG RETAIL SALES OF HARDWARE DEVICES AND CONSUMER SOFTWARE ALSO CONTRIBUTED TO THE GROWTH OVER THE PRIOR YEAR.

EUROPE, MIDDLE EAST, AND AFRICA REGION REVENUE WAS $5.02 BILLION, $4.86 BILLION, AND $5.13 BILLION IN 2000, 2001, AND 2002. IN FISCAL 2002, THE MAJORITY OF THE GROWTH WAS A RESULT OF

STRONG MULTI-YEAR LICENSING REVENUE OF WINDOWS XP HOME AND PROFESSIONAL OPERATING SYSTEMS AND ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE, AS WELL AS THE ADDITION OF XBOX VIDEO GAME SYSTEM REVENUE IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE YEAR. IN FISCAL 2001, WEAKENING LOCAL CURRENCIES

NEGATIVELY IMPACTED TRANSLATED REVENUE COMPARED TO THE PRIOR YEAR, WHILE REVENUE FROM WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL AND THE .NET ENTERPRISE SERVER FAMILY OF PRODUCTS WAS VERY HEALTHY. IN FISCAL 2000, RETAIL SALES OF WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEMS AND

OFFICE LICENSING PRODUCED MODERATE GROWTH IN THE REGION. GROWTH FROM SQL SERVER LICENSING, NEW HARDWARE DEVICE OFFERINGS, AND ENTERTAINMENT SOFTWARE WAS ESPECIALLY STRONG.

ASIA REGION REVENUE WAS $2.60 BILLION IN 2000, $3.06 BILLION IN 2001, AND $2.83 BILLION IN 2002. IN FISCAL 2002, ASIA REGION REVENUE DECLINED MOST NOTABLY DUE TO LOWER CONSUMER PC

SHIPMENTS, WHICH HAMPERED REVENUE FROM LOCALIZED VERSIONS OF MICROSOFT OFFICE 2000 AND MICROSOFT OFFICE XP, ESPECIALLY THE OFFICE PERSONAL EDITION. XBOX VIDEO GAME SYSTEM SALES PARTIALLY OFFSET THE DECLINE IN OFFICE REVENUE. IN FISCAL 2001, THE

REGIONS GROWTH RATE REFLECTED STRONG REVENUE FROM LOCALIZED VERSIONS OF MICROSOFT OFFICE 2000 AND MICROSOFT OFFICE XP, ESPECIALLY THE OFFICE PERSONAL EDITION. THIS GROWTH WAS ALSO ATTRIBUTABLE TO WINDOWS 2000 PROFESSIONAL AND .NET SERVER

APPLICATIONS LICENSING. IN FISCAL 2000, THE REGIONS GROWTH RATE REFLECTED STRONG PERFORMANCE RESULTING FROM IMPROVED LOCAL ECONOMIC CONDITIONS. REVENUE GROWTH WAS ALSO INFLUENCED BY ROBUST GROWTH OF LOCALIZED VERSIONS OF MICROSOFT OFFICE 2000,

ESPECIALLY THE OFFICE PERSONAL EDITION SOLD IN JAPAN, WINDOWS PLATFORM AND SERVER LICENSING, AND STRONG ADOPTION OF SQL SERVER.

THE COMPANYS OPERATING

RESULTS ARE AFFECTED BY FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES. APPROXIMATELY 30%, 27%, AND 25% OF THE COMPANYS REVENUE WAS COLLECTED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES DURING 2000, 2001, AND 2002. SINCE A PORTION OF LOCAL CURRENCY REVENUE IS HEDGED AND MUCH OF THE

COMPANYS INTERNATIONAL MANUFACTURING COSTS AND OPERATING EXPENSES ARE ALSO INCURRED IN LOCAL CURRENCIES, THE IMPACT OF EXCHANGE RATES IS PARTIALLY MITIGATED.

OPERATING EXPENSES

COST OF REVENUE

.    COST OF REVENUE AS A PERCENT OF

REVENUE WAS 13.1% IN 2000, 13.7% IN 2001, AND 18.3% IN 2002. COST OF REVENUE IN FISCAL 2002 INCREASED PRIMARILY DUE TO COSTS RELATED TO XBOX. IN FISCAL 2001, HIGHER SUPPORT AND SERVICE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH THE MSN INTERNET ACCESS AND MSN NETWORK

SERVICES WERE PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE LOWER RELATIVE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH ORGANIZATIONAL LICENSING AND THE DROP IN THE MIX OF PACKAGED PRODUCT VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR. COST OF REVENUE IN FISCAL 2000 REFLECTED LOWER COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH WEBTV

NETWORKS OPERATIONS, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE GROWTH IN HARDWARE PERIPHERALS COSTS.

RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT.

THE DISCONTINUATION OF GOODWILL AMORTIZATION IN FISCAL 2002 IN ACCORDANCE WITH STATEMENT OF FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING STANDARDS (SFAS) 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

OFFSET THE GROWTH IN

HEADCOUNT AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS. IN FISCAL 2001, THE INCREASE IN R&D EXPENSE WAS THE RESULT OF HIGHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS AND INVESTMENTS IN NEW PRODUCT INITIATIVES. THE INCREASE IN FISCAL 2000 WAS DRIVEN PRIMARILY BY HIGHER

HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS. PROSPECTIVELY, INCREASED HEADCOUNT AND INCREASED SPENDING IN SERVER PLATFORMS, HOME & ENTERTAINMENT, BUSINESS SOLUTIONS AND CE ARE CURRENTLY EXPECTED TO BE SIGNIFICANT FACTORS AFFECTING FUTURE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

EXPENSE GROWTH.

SALES AND MARKETING.

SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE WAS 18.0% IN 2000, 19.3%

IN 2001, AND 19.1% IN 2002. IN FISCAL 2002, SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSE AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE DECREASED DUE TO LOWER RELATIVE MSN CUSTOMER ACQUISITION MARKETING AND THE LARGE RELATIVE INCREASE ASSOCIATED WITH THE ONSET OF XBOX VIDEO GAME SYSTEM

REVENUE. IN FISCAL 2001, SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER RELATIVE HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS, HIGHER MARKETING AND SALES EXPENSES ASSOCIATED WITH MSN, THE MICROSOFT AGILITY ADVERTISING CAMPAIGN, AND OTHER

NEW SALES INITIATIVES. IN FISCAL 2000, SALES AND MARKETING EXPENSES AS A PERCENTAGE OF REVENUE INCREASED DUE TO HIGHER RELATIVE MARKETING COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH NEW PRODUCT RELEASES AND ONLINE MARKETING. MICROSOFT EXPECTS THAT IT WILL INCREASE

SPENDING ON INFORMATION WORKER, SERVER PLATFORMS, AND BUSINESS SOLUTIONS SALES FORCES AND WINDOWS CLIENT, MSN AND HOME & ENTERTAINMENT MARKETING.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE.

GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2002 INCREASED DUE TO A CHARGE OF APPROXIMATELY $660 MILLION FOR ESTIMATED EXPENSES RELATED TO THE COMPANYS CONSUMER CLASS

ACTION LAWSUITS AND HIGHER LEGAL FEES. IN FISCAL 2001, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS DECREASED DUE TO A CHARGE RELATED TO THE SETTLEMENT OF THE LAWSUIT WITH CALDERA, INC. RECORDED IN FISCAL 2000. EXCLUDING THIS CHARGE IN FISCAL 2000, GENERAL AND

ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES IN FISCAL 2001 INCREASED FROM THE PRIOR YEAR DUE TO HIGHER HEADCOUNT-RELATED COSTS AND LEGAL FEES. FOR FISCAL 2000, BESIDES THE SETTLEMENT OF THE LAWSUIT, GENERAL AND ADMINISTRATIVE EXPENSES ALSO REFLECTED INCREASED LEGAL

FEES AND CERTAIN EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION-RELATED EXPENSES.

NON-OPERATING ITEMS, INVESTMENT INCOME/(LOSS), AND INCOME TAXES

LOSSES ON EQUITY INVESTEES AND OTHER CONSISTS OF MICROSOFTS SHARE OF INCOME OR LOSS FROM INVESTMENTS ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY

METHOD, AND INCOME OR LOSS ATTRIBUTABLE TO MINORITY INTERESTS. THE DECREASE IN LOSSES ON EQUITY INVESTEES AND OTHER IN FISCAL 2002 WAS ATTRIBUTED TO THE DIVESTITURE OF CERTAIN EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN FISCAL 2002. THE INCREASE IN LOSSES ON EQUITY

INVESTEES AND OTHER IN FISCAL 2001 REFLECTS AN INCREASE IN THE NUMBER OF SUCH INVESTMENTS DURING THE YEAR. IN FISCAL 2000 LOSSES ON EQUITY INVESTEES AND OTHER DECREASED REFLECTING SMALLER LOSSES FROM THE MSNBC ENTITIES.

IN FISCAL 2002, OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS PRIMARILY RELATED TO THE

COMPANYS INVESTMENT IN AT&T AND OTHER CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATION INVESTMENTS. NET GAINS ON THE SALES OF INVESTMENTS INCLUDED A $1.25 BILLION GAIN ON THE SALE OF THE COMPANYS SHARE OF EXPEDIA. INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME DECREASED

$66 MILLION FROM FISCAL 2001 AS A RESULT OF LOWER INTEREST RATES AND DIVIDEND INCOME.

IN FISCAL 2001, OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS PRIMARILY RELATED TO CABLE

AND TELECOMMUNICATION INVESTMENTS. NET GAINS FROM THE SALES OF INVESTMENTS IN FISCAL 2001 INCLUDED A GAIN FROM MICROSOFTS INVESTMENT IN TITUS COMMUNICATIONS (WHICH WAS MERGED WITH JUPITER TELECOMMUNICATIONS) AND THE CLOSING OF THE SALE OF

TRANSPOINT TO CHECKFREE HOLDINGS CORP. INTEREST AND DIVIDEND INCOME INCREASED $591 MILLION FROM FISCAL 2000, REFLECTING A LARGER INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO. IN FISCAL YEAR 2000, INVESTMENT INCOME INCREASED PRIMARILY AS A RESULT OF A LARGER INVESTMENT

PORTFOLIO GENERATED BY CASH FROM OPERATIONS COUPLED WITH REALIZED GAINS FROM THE SALE OF SECURITIES.

AT JUNE 30, 2002, UNREALIZED LOSSES ON EQUITY AND OTHER

INVESTMENTS OF $623 MILLION WERE DEEMED TO BE TEMPORARY IN NATURE. THE FOLLOWING, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, COULD RESULT IN SOME INVESTMENTS BEING DEEMED OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED IN FUTURE PERIODS: CHANGES IN THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE

FAIR VALUE IS LESS THAN COST; THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS; AND THE COMPANYS INTENT AND ABILITY

TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT.

IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO COMBINE AT&T BROADBAND WITH COMCAST IN A NEW COMPANY TO BE CALLED AT&T COMCAST

CORPORATION, MICROSOFT HAS AGREED TO EXCHANGE ITS AT&T 5% CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED DEBT SECURITIES FOR APPROXIMATELY 115 MILLION SHARES OF AT&T COMCAST CORPORATION. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE TRANSACTION WILL CLOSE BY DECEMBER 31, 2002. WHILE IT

IS POSSIBLE THAT MICROSOFT COULD INCUR A LOSS ON THIS EXCHANGE TRANSACTION UP TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE AT&T DEBT SECURITIES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS, IF ANY, WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS. AS MANAGEMENT IS UNABLE TO PREDICT

WHETHER THERE WILL BE A GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EXCHANGE, NO LOSS HAS BEEN RECORDED RELATED TO THIS CONTINGENT EXCHANGE TRANSACTION AS OF JUNE 30, 2002.

THE

COMPANYS EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2002 WAS 32%. THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE FOR FISCAL 2001 AND FISCAL 2000 WAS 33% AND 34%, RESPECTIVELY. THE DECREASE IN THE EFFECTIVE TAX RATE IS DUE PRIMARILY TO LOWER TAXES ON FOREIGN EARNINGS.

ACCOUNTING CHANGES

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2001, MICROSOFT ADOPTED SFAS 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS,

AND SFAS 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

SFAS 141 REQUIRES BUSINESS COMBINATIONS TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF

ACCOUNTING. IT ALSO SPECIFIES THE TYPES OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED AND REPORTED SEPARATE FROM GOODWILL. SFAS 142 REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLES NO LONGER BE AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD TESTED FOR

IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS 142. GOODWILL AMORTIZATION (ON A PRE-TAX BASIS) WAS $234 MILLION IN FISCAL 2000 AND $311 MILLION IN FISCAL 2001.

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2000, MICROSOFT ADOPTED SFAS 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

WHICH ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING

CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS AND FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX REDUCTION TO INCOME OF $560 MILLION ($375 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AND A CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX REDUCTION TO OTHER

COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI) OF $112 MILLION ($75 MILLION AFTER-TAX). THE REDUCTION TO INCOME WAS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION RECLASSIFIED FROM OCI FOR THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS AND A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION

RECLASSIFIED FROM OCI FOR DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE REDUCTION TO OCI WAS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $670 MILLION ON CASH FLOW HEDGES OFFSET BY THE RECLASSIFICATIONS OUT OF OCI OF THE APPROXIMATELY

$300 MILLION LOSS FOR THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS AND THE APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION LOSS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

FINANCIAL CONDITION

THE COMPANYS CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENT PORTFOLIO TOTALED $38.65 BILLION AT JUNE 30,

2002. THE PORTFOLIO CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES, DIVERSIFIED AMONG INDUSTRIES AND INDIVIDUAL ISSUERS. MICROSOFTS INVESTMENTS ARE GENERALLY LIQUID AND INVESTMENT GRADE. THE PORTFOLIO IS INVESTED PREDOMINANTLY IN U.S. DOLLAR

DENOMINATED SECURITIES, BUT ALSO INCLUDES FOREIGN CURRENCY POSITIONS IN ORDER TO DIVERSIFY FINANCIAL RISK. THE PORTFOLIO IS PRIMARILY INVESTED IN SHORT-TERM SECURITIES TO MINIMIZE INTEREST RATE RISK AND FACILITATE RAPID DEPLOYMENT FOR IMMEDIATE CASH

NEEDS.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS $14.51 BILLION FOR FISCAL 2002, AN INCREASE OF $1.09 BILLION FROM FISCAL 2001. THE

INCREASE REFLECTS STRONG GROWTH IN UNEARNED REVENUE. CASH USED FOR FINANCING WAS $4.57 BILLION IN FISCAL 2002, A DECREASE OF $1.01 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE DECREASE REFLECTS THE REPURCHASE OF PUT WARRANTS IN THE PRIOR YEAR. THE COMPANY

REPURCHASED 122.8 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK UNDER ITS SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM IN FISCAL 2002, COMPARED TO 89.0 MILLION SHARES REPURCHASED IN THE PRIOR YEAR. IN ADDITION, 5.1 MILLION SHARES OF COMMON STOCK WERE ACQUIRED IN FISCAL 2002 UNDER A

STRUCTURED STOCK REPURCHASE TRANSACTION. THE COMPANY ENTERED INTO THE STRUCTURED STOCK REPURCHASE TRANSACTION IN FISCAL 2001, GIVING IT THE RIGHT TO ACQUIRE 5.1 MILLION OF ITS SHARES IN EXCHANGE FOR AN UP-FRONT NET PAYMENT OF $264 MILLION. CASH USED

FOR INVESTING WAS $10.85 BILLION IN FISCAL 2002, AN INCREASE OF $2.11 BILLION FROM FISCAL 2001.

CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS $13.42 BILLION IN FISCAL 2001, AN

INCREASE OF $2.00 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE WAS PRIMARILY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE GROWTH IN REVENUE AND OTHER CHANGES IN WORKING CAPITAL, PARTIALLY OFFSET BY THE DECREASE IN THE STOCK OPTION INCOME TAX BENEFIT, REFLECTING DECREASED STOCK

OPTION EXERCISES BY EMPLOYEES. CASH USED FOR FINANCING WAS $5.59 BILLION IN FISCAL 2001, AN INCREASE OF $3.39 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. THE INCREASE PRIMARILY REFLECTS THE REPURCHASE OF PUT WARRANTS IN FISCAL 2001, COMPARED TO THE SALE OF PUT

WARRANTS IN THE PRIOR FISCAL YEAR, AS WELL AS AN INCREASE IN COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED. ALL OUTSTANDING PUT WARRANTS WERE EITHER RETIRED OR EXERCISED DURING FISCAL 2001. DURING FISCAL 2001, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 89.0 MILLION SHARES. CASH USED FOR

INVESTING WAS $8.73 BILLION IN FISCAL 2001, A DECREASE OF $658 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR. IN FISCAL 2000, CASH FLOW FROM OPERATIONS WAS $11.43 BILLION, A DECREASE OF $720 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING WORKING CAPITAL CHANGES PARTIALLY

OFFSET BY THE INCREASE IN THE STOCK OPTION INCOME TAX BENEFIT. CASH USED FOR FINANCING WAS $2.19 BILLION IN FISCAL 2000, AN INCREASE OF $1.33 BILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR, REFLECTING AN INCREASE IN COMMON STOCK REPURCHASED VERSUS THE PRIOR YEAR.

DURING FISCAL 2000, THE COMPANY REPURCHASED 55.2 MILLION SHARES. CASH USED FOR INVESTING WAS $9.39 BILLION IN FISCAL 2000, A DECREASE OF $808 MILLION FROM THE PRIOR YEAR.

MICROSOFT HAS NO MATERIAL LONG-TERM DEBT. STOCKHOLDERS EQUITY AT JUNE 30, 2002 WAS $52.18 BILLION. MICROSOFT WILL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN SALES, MARKETING, AND PRODUCT SUPPORT INFRASTRUCTURE. ADDITIONALLY, RESEARCH AND

DEVELOPMENT ACTIVITIES WILL INCLUDE INVESTMENTS IN EXISTING AND ADVANCED AREAS OF TECHNOLOGY, INCLUDING USING CASH TO ACQUIRE TECHNOLOGY. ADDITIONS TO PROPERTY AND EQUIPMENT WILL CONTINUE, INCLUDING NEW FACILITIES AND COMPUTER SYSTEMS FOR R&D,

SALES AND MARKETING, SUPPORT, AND ADMINISTRATIVE STAFF. COMMITMENTS FOR CONSTRUCTING NEW BUILDINGS WERE $111 MILLION ON JUNE 30, 2002. THE COMPANY HAS NOT ENGAGED IN ANY TRANSACTIONS OR ARRANGEMENTS WITH UNCONSOLIDATED ENTITIES OR OTHER PERSONS THAT

ARE REASONABLY LIKELY TO AFFECT MATERIALLY LIQUIDITY OR THE AVAILABILITY OF OR REQUIREMENTS FOR CAPITAL RESOURCES. SINCE FISCAL 1990, MICROSOFT HAS REPURCHASED 982 MILLION COMMON SHARES WHILE 2.23 BILLION SHARES WERE ISSUED UNDER THE COMPANYS

EMPLOYEE STOCK OPTION AND PURCHASE PLANS. THE COMPANYS CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED STOCK MATURED ON DECEMBER 15, 1999. EACH PREFERRED SHARE WAS CONVERTED INTO 1.1273 COMMON SHARES.

MANAGEMENT BELIEVES EXISTING CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS TOGETHER WITH FUNDS GENERATED FROM OPERATIONS SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO MEET OPERATING REQUIREMENTS. THE COMPANYS CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE AVAILABLE

FOR STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS, MERGERS AND ACQUISITIONS, OTHER POTENTIAL LARGE-SCALE NEEDS AND TO FUND THE SHARE REPURCHASE PROGRAM. MICROSOFT HAS NOT PAID CASH DIVIDENDS ON ITS COMMON STOCK.

SUBSEQUENT EVENT

OF THE SUCCESSFUL CLOSE OF A TENDER OFFER. MICROSOFT PURCHASED NAVISIONS SHARES FOR APPROXIMATELY $1.45 BILLION IN STOCK AND CASH. NAVISION IS A PROVIDER OF INTEGRATED BUSINESS SOFTWARE SOLUTIONS FOR SMALL AND MEDIUM-SIZED COMPANIES.

APPLICATION OF CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES

MICROSOFTS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH GENERALLY ACCEPTED ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES IN THE UNITED STATES. PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES

AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS ARE AFFECTED BY MANAGEMENTS APPLICATION OF ACCOUNTING POLICIES. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES FOR MICROSOFT INCLUDE

REVENUE RECOGNITION, IMPAIRMENT OF INVESTMENT SECURITIES, ACCOUNTING FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS, ACCOUNTING FOR LEGAL CONTINGENCIES, AND ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES.

MICROSOFT ACCOUNTS FOR THE LICENSING OF SOFTWARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA) STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) 97-2,

SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE APPLICATION OF SOP 97-2

REQUIRES JUDGMENT, INCLUDING WHETHER A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT INCLUDES MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, AND IF SO, WHETHER VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE) OF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR THOSE ELEMENTS. END USERS RECEIVE CERTAIN ELEMENTS OF THE COMPANYS

PRODUCTS OVER A PERIOD OF TIME. THESE ELEMENTS INCLUDE BROWSER TECHNOLOGIES UPDATES AND TECHNICAL SUPPORT, THE FAIR VALUE OF WHICH IS RECOGNIZED OVER THE PRODUCTS ESTIMATED LIFE CYCLE. CHANGES TO THE ELEMENTS IN A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, THE

ABILITY TO IDENTIFY VSOE FOR THOSE ELEMENTS, THE FAIR VALUE OF THE RESPECTIVE ELEMENTS, AND CHANGES TO A PRODUCTS ESTIMATED LIFE CYCLE COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF EARNED AND UNEARNED REVENUE. JUDGMENT IS ALSO REQUIRED TO ASSESS

WHETHER FUTURE RELEASES OF CERTAIN SOFTWARE REPRESENT NEW PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS.

AND SECURITIES AND EXCHANGE COMMISSION (SEC) STAFF ACCOUNTING BULLETIN (SAB) 59,

ACCOUNTING FOR NONCURRENT MARKETABLE EQUITY SECURITIES,

PROVIDE GUIDANCE ON DETERMINING WHEN AN INVESTMENT IS

OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARILY IMPAIRED, WHICH ALSO REQUIRES JUDGMENT. IN MAKING THIS JUDGMENT, MICROSOFT EVALUATES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE OF AN INVESTMENT IS LESS THAN ITS COST; THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND

BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING FACTORS SUCH AS INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW; AND THE COMPANYS INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD THE INVESTMENT.

MICROSOFT ACCOUNTS FOR RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS IN ACCORDANCE WITH SEVERAL ACCOUNTING PRONOUNCEMENTS, INCLUDING SFAS 2,

WISE MARKETED.

SFAS 86 SPECIFIES THAT COSTS INCURRED INTERNALLY IN CREATING A COMPUTER SOFTWARE PRODUCT SHOULD BE CHARGED TO EXPENSE WHEN INCURRED AS RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT UNTIL

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY HAS BEEN ESTABLISHED FOR THE PRODUCT. ONCE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED, ALL SOFTWARE COSTS SHOULD BE CAPITALIZED UNTIL THE PRODUCT IS AVAILABLE FOR GENERAL RELEASE TO CUSTOMERS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN

DETERMINING WHEN THE TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY OF A PRODUCT IS ESTABLISHED. MICROSOFT HAS DETERMINED THAT TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR ITS PRODUCTS IS REACHED SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. COSTS INCURRED AFTER

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED ARE NOT MATERIAL, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY EXPENSES ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS WHEN INCURRED.

MICROSOFT IS

SUBJECT TO VARIOUS LEGAL PROCEEDINGS AND CLAIMS, THE OUTCOMES OF WHICH ARE SUBJECT TO SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY. SFAS 5,

ACCOUNTING FOR CONTINGENCIES,

REQUIRES THAT AN ESTIMATED LOSS FROM A LOSS CONTINGENCY SHOULD BE ACCRUED BY A CHARGE TO

INCOME IF IT IS PROBABLE THAT AN ASSET HAS BEEN IMPAIRED OR A LIABILITY HAS BEEN INCURRED AND THE AMOUNT OF THE LOSS CAN BE REASONABLY ESTIMATED. DISCLOSURE OF A CONTINGENCY IS REQUIRED IF THERE IS AT LEAST A REASONABLE POSSIBILITY THAT A LOSS HAS

BEEN INCURRED. THE COMPANY EVALUATES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DEGREE OF PROBABILITY OF AN UNFAVORABLE OUTCOME AND THE ABILITY TO MAKE A REASONABLE ESTIMATE OF THE AMOUNT OF LOSS. CHANGES IN THESE FACTORS COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION OR ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

SFAS 109,

ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES,

ESTABLISHES FINANCIAL ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR THE

EFFECT OF INCOME TAXES. THE OBJECTIVES OF ACCOUNTING FOR INCOME TAXES ARE TO RECOGNIZE THE AMOUNT OF TAXES PAYABLE OR REFUNDABLE FOR THE CURRENT YEAR AND DEFERRED TAX LIABILITIES AND ASSETS FOR THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

RECOGNIZED IN AN ENTITYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. JUDGMENT IS REQUIRED IN ASSESSING THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS. FLUCTUATIONS IN THE

ACTUAL OUTCOME OF THESE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES COULD MATERIALLY IMPACT THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL POSITION OR ITS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS.

ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES

THE FOLLOWING ISSUES AND UNCERTAINTIES, AMONG OTHERS, SHOULD BE CONSIDERED IN EVALUATING THE

COMPANYS FINANCIAL OUTLOOK.

CHALLENGES TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS MODEL.

SINCE ITS INCEPTION, THE

COMPANYS BUSINESS MODEL HAS BEEN BASED UPON CUSTOMERS AGREEING TO PAY A FEE TO LICENSE SOFTWARE DEVELOPED AND DISTRIBUTED BY MICROSOFT. UNDER THIS COMMERCIAL SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT (CSD) MODEL, SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS BEAR THE COSTS OF

CONVERTING ORIGINAL IDEAS INTO SOFTWARE PRODUCTS THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT, OFFSETTING THESE COSTS WITH THE REVENUES RECEIVED FROM THE DISTRIBUTION OF THEIR PRODUCTS. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE CSD MODEL HAS HAD SUBSTANTIAL

BENEFITS FOR USERS OF SOFTWARE, ALLOWING THEM TO RELY ON THE EXPERTISE OF THE COMPANY AND OTHER SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS THAT HAVE POWERFUL INCENTIVES TO DEVELOP INNOVATIVE SOFTWARE THAT IS USEFUL, RELIABLE AND COMPATIBLE WITH OTHER SOFTWARE AND

HARDWARE. IN RECENT YEARS, THERE HAS BEEN A GROWING CHALLENGE TO THE CSD MODEL, OFTEN REFERRED TO AS THE OPEN SOURCE MOVEMENT. UNDER THE OPEN SOURCE MODEL, SOFTWARE IS PRODUCED BY GLOBAL COMMUNITIES OF PROGRAMMERS, AND THE RESULTING

SOFTWARE AND THE INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY CONTAINED THEREIN IS LICENSED TO END USERS AT LITTLE OR NO COST. THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THERE ARE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS WITH THE OPEN SOURCE MODEL, THE PRINCIPAL DRAWBACK BEING THAT NO SINGLE ENTITY IS

RESPONSIBLE FOR THE OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE, AND THUS USERS HAVE NO RECOURSE IF A PRODUCT DOES NOT WORK PROPERLY OR AT ALL. FURTHER, WITHOUT THE MARKET INCENTIVES ASSOCIATED WITH THE CSD MODEL, THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT THE VIGOROUS INNOVATION AND

GROWTH OF THE SOFTWARE INDUSTRY OVER THE LAST 25 YEARS WOULD NOT HAVE OCCURRED. NONETHELESS, THE POPULARIZATION OF THE OPEN SOURCE MOVEMENT CONTINUES TO POSE A SIGNIFICANT CHALLENGE TO THE COMPANYS BUSINESS MODEL, INCLUDING RECENT EFFORTS BY

PROPONENTS OF THE OPEN SOURCE MODEL TO CONVINCE GOVERNMENTS WORLDWIDE TO MANDATE THE USE OF OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE IN THEIR PURCHASE AND DEPLOYMENT OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS. TO THE EXTENT THE OPEN SOURCE MODEL GAINS INCREASING MARKET ACCEPTANCE, SALES OF

THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS MAY DECLINE, THE COMPANY MAY HAVE TO REDUCE THE PRICES IT CHARGES FOR ITS PRODUCTS, AND REVENUES AND OPERATING MARGINS MAY CONSEQUENTLY DECLINE.

NEW PRODUCTS AND SERVICES.

THE COMPANY HAS MADE SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR NEW PRODUCTS, SERVICES AND TECHNOLOGIES, INCLUDING MICROSOFT .NET, XBOX,

BUSINESS APPLICATIONS, MSN, MOBILE AND WIRELESS TECHNOLOGIES, AND TELEVISION. SIGNIFICANT REVENUE FROM THESE INVESTMENTS MAY NOT BE ACHIEVED FOR A NUMBER OF YEARS, IF AT ALL. MOREOVER, THESE PRODUCTS AND SERVICES MAY NEVER BE PROFITABLE, AND EVEN IF

THEY ARE PROFITABLE, OPERATING MARGINS FOR THESE BUSINESSES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE AS HIGH AS THE MARGINS HISTORICALLY EXPERIENCED IN OUR DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES BUSINESSES.

DECLINES IN DEMAND FOR SOFTWARE.

IF OVERALL MARKET DEMAND FOR PCS, SERVERS AND OTHER COMPUTING DEVICES DECLINES SIGNIFICANTLY, AND CONSUMER AND CORPORATE SPENDING FOR

SUCH PRODUCTS DECLINES, MICROSOFTS REVENUE GROWTH WILL BE ADVERSELY AFFECTED. ADDITIONALLY, THE COMPANYS REVENUES WOULD BE UNFAVORABLY IMPACTED IF CUSTOMERS REDUCE THEIR PURCHASES OF NEW SOFTWARE PRODUCTS OR UPGRADES TO EXISTING PRODUCTS

IF SUCH NEW OFFERINGS ARE NOT PERCEIVED TO ADD SIGNIFICANT NEW FUNCTIONALITY OR OTHER VALUE TO PROSPECTIVE PURCHASERS.

PRODUCT DEVELOPMENT

SCHEDULE.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS A COMPLEX AND TIME-CONSUMING PROCESS. NEW PRODUCTS AND ENHANCEMENTS TO EXISTING PRODUCTS CAN REQUIRE LONG DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING PERIODS. SIGNIFICANT DELAYS IN NEW PRODUCT

RELEASES OR SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS IN CREATING NEW PRODUCTS COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT THE COMPANYS REVENUES.

INTERNATIONAL

OPERATIONS.

MICROSOFT DEVELOPS AND SELLS PRODUCTS THROUGHOUT THE WORLD. THE PRICES OF THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN COUNTRIES OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES ARE GENERALLY HIGHER THAN THE COMPANYS PRICES IN THE UNITED

STATES BECAUSE OF THE COST INCURRED IN LOCALIZING SOFTWARE FOR NON-U.S. MARKETS. THE COSTS OF PRODUCING AND SELLING THE COMPANYS PRODUCTS IN THESE COUNTRIES ALSO ARE HIGHER. PRESSURE TO GLOBALIZE MICROSOFTS PRICING STRUCTURE MIGHT

REQUIRE THAT THE COMPANY REDUCE THE SALES PRICE OF ITS SOFTWARE IN OTHER COUNTRIES, EVEN THOUGH THE COSTS OF THE SOFTWARE CONTINUE TO BE HIGHER THAN IN THE UNITED STATES. UNFAVORABLE CHANGES IN TRADE PROTECTION LAWS, POLICIES AND MEASURES, AND OTHER

REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS AFFECTING TRADE AND INVESTMENT; UNEXPECTED CHANGES IN REGULATORY REQUIREMENTS FOR SOFTWARE; SOCIAL, POLITICAL, LABOR, OR ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN A SPECIFIC COUNTRY OR REGION, INCLUDING FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES; DIFFICULTIES IN

STAFFING AND MANAGING FOREIGN OPERATIONS; AND POTENTIAL ADVERSE FOREIGN TAX CONSEQUENCES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, COULD ALSO HAVE A NEGATIVE EFFECT ON THE COMPANYS BUSINESS AND RESULTS OF OPERATIONS OUTSIDE OF THE UNITED STATES.

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.

MICROSOFT DILIGENTLY DEFENDS ITS

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS, BUT UNLICENSED COPYING AND USE OF SOFTWARE REPRESENTS A LOSS OF REVENUE TO THE COMPANY. WHILE THIS ADVERSELY AFFECTS U.S. REVENUE, REVENUE LOSS IS EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES, PARTICULARLY IN

COUNTRIES WHERE LAWS ARE LESS PROTECTIVE OF INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS. THROUGHOUT THE WORLD, MICROSOFT ACTIVELY EDUCATES CONSUMERS ON THE BENEFITS OF LICENSING GENUINE PRODUCTS AND EDUCATES LAWMAKERS ON THE ADVANTAGES OF A BUSINESS CLIMATE WHERE

INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE PROTECTED. HOWEVER, CONTINUED EFFORTS MAY NOT AFFECT REVENUE POSITIVELY AND FURTHER DETERIORATION IN COMPLIANCE WITH EXISTING LEGAL PROTECTIONS OR REDUCTIONS IN THE LEGAL PROTECTION FOR INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS

OF SOFTWARE DEVELOPERS COULD ADVERSELY AFFECT REVENUE.

TAXATION OF EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME.

IN AUGUST 2001, A WORLD

TRADE ORGANIZATION (WTO) DISPUTE PANEL DETERMINED THAT THE EXTRATERRITORIAL TAX (ETI) PROVISIONS OF THE FSC REPEAL AND EXTRATERRITORIAL INCOME EXCLUSION ACT OF 2000 CONSTITUTE AN EXPORT SUBSIDY PROHIBITED BY THE WTO AGREEMENT

ON SUBSIDIES AND COUNTERVAILING MEASURES AGREEMENT. THE U.S. GOVERNMENT APPEALED THE PANELS DECISION AND LOST ITS APPEAL. ON JANUARY 29, 2002, THE WTO DISPUTE SETTLEMENT BODY ADOPTED THE APPELLATE BODY REPORT. PRESIDENT BUSH HAS STATED THE

U.S. WILL BRING ITS TAX LAWS INTO COMPLIANCE WITH THE WTO RULING, BUT THE ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS HAVE NOT DECIDED ON A SOLUTION FOR THIS ISSUE. IN JULY 2002, REPRESENTATIVE BILL THOMAS, CHAIRMAN OF THE HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE, INTRODUCED

THE AMERICAN COMPETITIVENESS AND CORPORATE ACCOUNTABILITY ACT OF 2002. IF ENACTED, THAT BILL WOULD REPEAL THE ETI REGIME AND INTRODUCE BROAD-BASED INTERNATIONAL REFORM. THE PROPOSED REFORMS WOULD NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT THE COMPANY. ON AUGUST 30,

2002, A WTO ARBITRATION PANEL DETERMINED THAT THE EUROPEAN UNION MAY IMPOSE UP TO $4.04 BILLION PER YEAR IN COUNTERMEASURES IF THE U.S. RULES ARE NOT BROUGHT INTO COMPLIANCE. THE WTO DECISION DOES NOT REPEAL THE ETI TAX BENEFIT AND IT DOES NOT

REQUIRE THE EUROPEAN UNION TO IMPOSE TRADE SANCTIONS, SO IT IS NOT POSSIBLE TO PREDICT WHAT IMPACT THE WTO DECISION WILL HAVE ON FUTURE RESULTS PENDING FINAL RESOLUTION OF THESE MATTERS. IF THE ETI EXCLUSION IS REPEALED AND REPLACEMENT LEGISLATION

IS NOT ENACTED, THE LOSS OF TAX BENEFIT TO THE COMPANY COULD BE SIGNIFICANT.

LITIGATION.

AS DISCUSSED IN NOTE 19CONTINGENCIES OF THE NOTES TO

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS, THE COMPANY IS SUBJECT TO A VARIETY OF CLAIMS AND LAWSUITS. WHILE THE COMPANY BELIEVES THAT NONE OF THE LITIGATION MATTERS IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS CURRENTLY INVOLVED WILL HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE COMPANYS

FINANCIAL POSITION OR RESULTS OF OPERATIONS, IT IS POSSIBLE THAT ONE OR MORE OF THESE MATTERS COULD BE RESOLVED IN A MANNER THAT WOULD ULTIMATELY HAVE A MATERIAL ADVERSE IMPACT ON THE BUSINESS OF THE COMPANY, AND COULD NEGATIVELY IMPACT ITS REVENUES

AND OPERATING MARGINS.

ITEM 7A.    QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK

THE COMPANY IS EXPOSED TO FOREIGN

CURRENCY, INTEREST RATE, AND EQUITY PRICE RISKS. A PORTION OF THESE RISKS IS HEDGED, BUT FLUCTUATIONS COULD IMPACT THE COMPANYS RESULTS OF OPERATIONS AND FINANCIAL POSITION. THE COMPANY HEDGES THE EXPOSURE OF ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND A PORTION

OF ANTICIPATED REVENUE TO FOREIGN CURRENCY FLUCTUATIONS, PRIMARILY WITH OPTION CONTRACTS. THE COMPANY MONITORS ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE OVERALL EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE POSITIONS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES

HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. FIXED INCOME SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK. THE PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK. THE

COMPANY ROUTINELY USES OPTIONS TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHIC INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES. MANY SECURITIES HELD IN THE COMPANYS EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS PORTFOLIO ARE SUBJECT TO PRICE RISK. THE

COMPANY USES OPTIONS TO HEDGE ITS PRICE RISK ON CERTAIN HIGHLY VOLATILE EQUITY SECURITIES.

THE COMPANY USES A VALUE-AT-RISK (VAR) MODEL TO ESTIMATE AND QUANTIFY

ITS MARKET RISKS. VAR IS THE EXPECTED LOSS, FOR A GIVEN CONFIDENCE LEVEL, IN FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO DUE TO ADVERSE MARKET MOVEMENTS OVER A DEFINED TIME HORIZON. THE VAR MODEL IS NOT INTENDED TO REPRESENT ACTUAL LOSSES IN FAIR

VALUE, BUT IS USED AS A RISK ESTIMATION AND MANAGEMENT TOOL. THE MODEL USED FOR CURRENCIES AND EQUITIES IS GEOMETRIC BROWNIAN MOTION, WHICH ALLOW INCORPORATION OF OPTIONALITY OF THESE EXPOSURES. FOR INTEREST RATES, THE MEAN REVERTING GEOMETRIC

BROWNIAN MOTION IS USED TO REFLECT THE PRINCIPLE THAT FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES PRICES OVER TIME REVERT TO MATURITY VALUE.

VALUE-AT-RISK IS CALCULATED BY, FIRST,

SIMULATING 10,000 MARKET PRICE PATHS OVER 20 DAYS FOR EQUITIES, INTEREST RATES AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES, TAKING INTO ACCOUNT HISTORICAL CORRELATIONS AMONG THE DIFFERENT RATES AND PRICES. EACH RESULTING UNIQUE SET OF EQUITIES PRICES, INTEREST

RATES, AND FOREIGN EXCHANGE RATES IS APPLIED TO SUBSTANTIALLY ALL INDIVIDUAL HOLDINGS TO RE-PRICE EACH HOLDING. THE 250

TH

WORST PERFORMANCE (OUT OF 10,000) REPRESENTS THE VALUE-AT-RISK OVER 20 DAYS AT THE 97.5

TH

PERCENTILE.

SEVERAL RISK FACTORS ARE NOT CAPTURED IN THE MODEL, INCLUDING LIQUIDITY RISK, OPERATIONAL RISK, CREDIT RISK, AND LEGAL RISK.

A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF THE

COMPANYS EQUITY PORTFOLIO IS HELD FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES. THE COMPANY ATTEMPTS TO HEDGE THE VALUE OF THESE SECURITIES THROUGH THE USE OF DERIVATIVE CONTRACTS SUCH AS COLLARS. THE COMPANY HAS INCURRED SUBSTANTIAL IMPAIRMENT CHARGES RELATED TO

CERTAIN OF THESE SECURITIES IN FISCAL 2002 AND FISCAL 2001. SUCH IMPAIRMENT CHARGES HAVE BEEN INCURRED PRIMARILY FOR STRATEGIC EQUITY HOLDINGS THAT THE COMPANY HAS NOT BEEN ABLE TO HEDGE. THE VAR AMOUNTS DISCLOSED BELOW ARE NOT NECESSARILY

REFLECTIVE OF POTENTIAL ACCOUNTING LOSSES, AS THEY ARE USED AS A RISK MANAGEMENT TOOL AND REFLECT AN ESTIMATE OF POTENTIAL REDUCTIONS IN FAIR VALUE OF THE COMPANYS PORTFOLIO. LOSSES IN FAIR VALUE OVER A 20-DAY HOLDING PERIOD CAN EXCEED THE

REPORTED VAR BY SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS AND CAN ALSO ACCUMULATE OVER A LONGER TIME HORIZON THAN THE 20-DAY HOLDING PERIOD USED IN THE VAR ANALYSIS.

THE VAR NUMBERS ARE

SHOWN SEPARATELY FOR INTEREST RATE, CURRENCY, AND EQUITY RISKS. THESE VAR NUMBERS INCLUDE THE UNDERLYING PORTFOLIO POSITIONS AND RELATED HEDGES. HISTORICAL DATA IS USED TO ESTIMATE VAR. GIVEN RELIANCE ON HISTORICAL DATA, VAR IS MOST EFFECTIVE IN

ESTIMATING RISK EXPOSURES IN MARKETS IN WHICH THERE ARE NO FUNDAMENTAL CHANGES OR SHIFTS IN MARKET CONDITIONS. AN INHERENT LIMITATION IN VAR IS THAT THE DISTRIBUTION OF PAST CHANGES IN MARKET RISK FACTORS MAY NOT PRODUCE ACCURATE PREDICTIONS OF

FUTURE MARKET RISK.

NOTES TO FINANCIAL STATEMENTS

NOTE 1    ACCOUNTING POLICIES

ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND ACCOMPANYING NOTES ARE PREPARED IN ACCORDANCE WITH ACCOUNTING PRINCIPLES GENERALLY ACCEPTED IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.

PRINCIPLES OF CONSOLIDATION

THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS INCLUDE THE ACCOUNTS OF MICROSOFT

CORPORATION AND ITS SUBSIDIARIES (MICROSOFT). INTERCOMPANY TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES HAVE BEEN ELIMINATED. EQUITY INVESTMENTS IN WHICH MICROSOFT OWNS AT LEAST 20% OF THE VOTING SECURITIES ARE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, EXCEPT FOR

INVESTMENTS IN WHICH THE COMPANY IS NOT ABLE TO EXERCISE SIGNIFICANT INFLUENCE OVER THE INVESTEE, IN WHICH CASE, THE COST METHOD OF ACCOUNTING IS USED. ISSUANCES OF SHARES BY A SUBSIDIARY ARE ACCOUNTED FOR AS CAPITAL TRANSACTIONS.

ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS

PREPARING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS REQUIRES

MANAGEMENT TO MAKE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS THAT AFFECT THE REPORTED AMOUNTS OF ASSETS, LIABILITIES, REVENUE, AND EXPENSES. EXAMPLES INCLUDE ESTIMATES OF LOSS CONTINGENCIES AND PRODUCT LIFE CYCLES, AND ASSUMPTIONS SUCH AS THE ELEMENTS COMPRISING A

SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT, INCLUDING THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN UPGRADES/ENHANCEMENTS AND NEW PRODUCTS; WHEN THE COMPANY REACHES TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR ITS PRODUCTS; THE POTENTIAL OUTCOME OF THE FUTURE TAX CONSEQUENCES OF EVENTS THAT HAVE BEEN

RECOGNIZED IN THE COMPANYS FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OR TAX RETURNS; AND DETERMINING WHEN INVESTMENT IMPAIRMENTS ARE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. ACTUAL RESULTS AND OUTCOMES MAY DIFFER FROM THESE ESTIMATES AND ASSUMPTIONS.

FOREIGN CURRENCIES

ASSETS AND LIABILITIES RECORDED IN FOREIGN CURRENCIES ARE

TRANSLATED AT THE EXCHANGE RATE ON THE BALANCE SHEET DATE. TRANSLATION ADJUSTMENTS RESULTING FROM THIS PROCESS ARE CHARGED OR CREDITED TO OTHER COMPREHENSIVE INCOME (OCI). REVENUE AND EXPENSES ARE TRANSLATED AT AVERAGE RATES OF EXCHANGE PREVAILING

DURING THE YEAR.

REVENUE RECOGNITION

MICROSOFT ACCOUNTS FOR

THE LICENSING OF SOFTWARE IN ACCORDANCE WITH AMERICAN INSTITUTE OF CERTIFIED PUBLIC ACCOUNTANTS (AICPA) STATEMENT OF POSITION (SOP) 97-2,

SOFTWARE REVENUE RECOGNITION.

THE COMPANY RECOGNIZES REVENUE WHEN (I) PERSUASIVE EVIDENCE OF AN

ARRANGEMENT EXISTS; (II) DELIVERY HAS OCCURRED OR SERVICES HAVE BEEN RENDERED; (III) THE SALES PRICE IS FIXED OR DETERMINABLE; AND (IV) COLLECTIBILITY IS REASONABLY ASSURED. FOR SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENTS WITH MULTIPLE ELEMENTS, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED

DEPENDENT UPON WHETHER VENDOR-SPECIFIC OBJECTIVE EVIDENCE (VSOE) OF FAIR VALUE EXISTS FOR EACH OF THE ELEMENTS. WHEN VSOE DOES NOT EXIST FOR ALL THE ELEMENTS OF A SOFTWARE ARRANGEMENT AND THE ONLY UNDELIVERED ELEMENT IS POSTCONTRACT CUSTOMER SUPPORT

(PCS), THE ENTIRE LICENSING FEE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD. REVENUE ATTRIBUTABLE TO UNDELIVERED ELEMENTS, INCLUDING TECHNICAL SUPPORT AND INTERNET BROWSER TECHNOLOGIES, IS BASED ON THE AVERAGE SALES PRICE OF THOSE ELEMENTS WHEN

SOLD SEPARATELY, AND IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY ON A STRAIGHT-LINE BASIS OVER THE PRODUCTS LIFE CYCLE. PCS AND SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED RATABLY OVER THE CONTRACT PERIOD.

REVENUE FROM PRODUCTS LICENSED TO ORIGINAL EQUIPMENT MANUFACTURERS (OEMS) IS BASED ON THE LICENSING AGREEMENT WITH AN OEM AND HAS HISTORICALLY BEEN RECOGNIZED WHEN OEMS SHIP LICENSED PRODUCTS TO THEIR CUSTOMERS. LICENSING

PROVISIONS WERE MODIFIED WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF WINDOWS XP IN 2002 AND REVENUE FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS IS RECORDED UPON SHIPMENT OF THE PRODUCT TO OEMS. THE EFFECT OF THIS CHANGE IN LICENSING PROVISIONS WAS NOT MATERIAL. REVENUE FROM PACKAGED PRODUCT

SALES TO DISTRIBUTORS AND RESELLERS IS USUALLY RECORDED WHEN RELATED PRODUCTS ARE SHIPPED. HOWEVER, WHEN THE REVENUE RECOGNITION CRITERIA REQUIRED FOR DISTRIBUTOR AND RESELLER ARRANGEMENTS ARE NOT MET, REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS PAYMENTS ARE RECEIVED.

REVENUE RELATED TO THE COMPANYS XBOX GAME CONSOLE IS RECOGNIZED UPON SHIPMENT OF THE PRODUCT TO RETAILERS. ONLINE ADVERTISING REVENUE IS RECOGNIZED AS ADVERTISEMENTS ARE DISPLAYED. COSTS RELATED TO INSIGNIFICANT OBLIGATIONS, WHICH INCLUDE

TELEPHONE SUPPORT FOR CERTAIN PRODUCTS, ARE ACCRUED. PROVISIONS ARE RECORDED FOR ESTIMATED RETURNS, CONCESSIONS, AND BAD DEBTS.

COST OF REVENUE

COST OF REVENUE INCLUDES DIRECT COSTS TO MANUFACTURE AND DISTRIBUTE PRODUCT AND DIRECT COSTS TO PROVIDE ONLINE SERVICES, CONSULTING, PRODUCT

SUPPORT, AND TRAINING AND CERTIFICATION OF SYSTEM INTEGRATORS.

RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT

TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY FOR MICROSOFTS SOFTWARE PRODUCTS IS REACHED SHORTLY BEFORE THE PRODUCTS ARE RELEASED TO MANUFACTURING. COSTS INCURRED AFTER TECHNOLOGICAL FEASIBILITY IS ESTABLISHED ARE NOT

MATERIAL, AND ACCORDINGLY, THE COMPANY EXPENSES ALL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT COSTS WHEN INCURRED.

ADVERTISING COSTS

ADVERTISING COSTS ARE EXPENSED AS INCURRED. ADVERTISING EXPENSE WAS $1.23 BILLION IN 2000, $1.36 BILLION IN 2001, AND $1.27 BILLION IN 2002.

INCOME TAXES

INCOME TAX EXPENSE INCLUDES U.S. AND INTERNATIONAL INCOME TAXES, PLUS THE PROVISION FOR U.S. TAXES ON UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS OF INTERNATIONAL SUBSIDIARIES NOT DEEMED TO BE PERMANENTLY INVESTED. CERTAIN ITEMS OF INCOME AND EXPENSE ARE

NOT REPORTED IN TAX RETURNS AND FINANCIAL STATEMENTS IN THE SAME YEAR. THE TAX EFFECT OF THIS DIFFERENCE IS REPORTED AS DEFERRED INCOME TAXES.

FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS

THE COMPANY CONSIDERS ALL LIQUID INTEREST-EARNING INVESTMENTS WITH A MATURITY OF THREE MONTHS OR LESS AT THE DATE OF PURCHASE TO BE CASH

EQUIVALENTS. SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS GENERALLY MATURE BETWEEN THREE MONTHS AND SIX YEARS FROM THE PURCHASE DATE. INVESTMENTS WITH MATURITIES BEYOND ONE YEAR MAY BE CLASSIFIED AS SHORT-TERM BASED ON THEIR HIGHLY LIQUID NATURE AND BECAUSE SUCH

MARKETABLE SECURITIES REPRESENT THE INVESTMENT OF CASH THAT IS AVAILABLE FOR CURRENT OPERATIONS. ALL CASH AND SHORT-TERM INVESTMENTS ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE RECORDED AT MARKET VALUE USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD;

UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES ARE REFLECTED IN OCI.

EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS INCLUDE DEBT AND EQUITY INSTRUMENTS. DEBT SECURITIES AND PUBLICLY TRADED EQUITY

SECURITIES ARE CLASSIFIED AS AVAILABLE FOR SALE AND ARE RECORDED AT MARKET USING THE SPECIFIC IDENTIFICATION METHOD. UNREALIZED GAINS AND LOSSES (EXCLUDING OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY IMPAIRMENTS) ARE REFLECTED IN OCI. ALL OTHER INVESTMENTS, EXCLUDING

THOSE ACCOUNTED FOR USING THE EQUITY METHOD, ARE RECORDED AT COST.

MICROSOFT LENDS CERTAIN FIXED INCOME AND EQUITY SECURITIES TO ENHANCE INVESTMENT INCOME.

COLLATERAL AND/OR SECURITY INTEREST IS DETERMINED BASED UPON THE UNDERLYING SECURITY AND THE CREDITWORTHINESS OF THE BORROWER. THE FAIR VALUE OF COLLATERAL THAT MICROSOFT IS PERMITTED TO SELL OR REPLEDGE WAS $499 MILLION AT BOTH JUNE 30, 2001 AND

2002.

INVESTMENTS ARE CONSIDERED TO BE IMPAIRED WHEN A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS JUDGED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY. THE COMPANY EMPLOYS A SYSTEMATIC METHODOLOGY

THAT CONSIDERS AVAILABLE EVIDENCE IN EVALUATING POTENTIAL IMPAIRMENT OF ITS INVESTMENTS. IN THE EVENT THAT THE COST OF AN INVESTMENT EXCEEDS ITS FAIR VALUE, THE COMPANY EVALUATES, AMONG OTHER FACTORS, THE DURATION AND EXTENT TO WHICH THE FAIR VALUE

IS LESS THAN COST; THE FINANCIAL HEALTH OF AND BUSINESS OUTLOOK FOR THE INVESTEE, INCLUDING INDUSTRY AND SECTOR PERFORMANCE, CHANGES IN TECHNOLOGY, AND OPERATIONAL AND FINANCING CASH FLOW FACTORS; AND THE COMPANYS INTENT AND ABILITY TO HOLD

THE INVESTMENT. ONCE A DECLINE IN FAIR VALUE IS DETERMINED TO BE OTHER-THAN-TEMPORARY, AN IMPAIRMENT CHARGE IS RECORDED AND A NEW COST BASIS IN THE INVESTMENT IS ESTABLISHED. IN 2001, THE COMPANY RECOGNIZED $4.80 BILLION IN IMPAIRMENTS OF CERTAIN

INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY IN THE CABLE AND TELECOMMUNICATION INDUSTRIES. IN 2002, MICROSOFT RECOGNIZED $4.32 BILLION IN IMPAIRMENTS OF CERTAIN INVESTMENTS, PRIMARILY RELATED TO FURTHER DECLINES IN THE FAIR VALUES OF U.S. AND EUROPEAN CABLE AND

TELECOMMUNICATIONS HOLDINGS.

THE COMPANY USES DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS TO MANAGE EXPOSURES TO FOREIGN CURRENCY, SECURITY PRICE, AND INTEREST RATE RISKS. THE

COMPANYS OBJECTIVES FOR HOLDING DERIVATIVES ARE TO MINIMIZE THESE RISKS USING THE MOST EFFECTIVE METHODS TO ELIMINATE OR REDUCE THE IMPACT OF THESE EXPOSURES.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK.

CERTAIN FORECASTED TRANSACTIONS AND ASSETS ARE EXPOSED TO FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK. THE COMPANY MONITORS ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY EXPOSURES DAILY TO MAXIMIZE THE OVERALL

EFFECTIVENESS OF ITS FOREIGN CURRENCY HEDGE POSITIONS. PRINCIPAL CURRENCIES HEDGED INCLUDE THE EURO, JAPANESE YEN, BRITISH POUND, AND CANADIAN DOLLAR. OPTIONS USED TO HEDGE A PORTION OF FORECASTED INTERNATIONAL REVENUE FOR UP TO THREE YEARS IN THE

FUTURE ARE DESIGNATED AS CASH FLOW HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. OPTIONS AND FORWARDS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS UNDER SFAS 133 ARE ALSO USED TO HEDGE THE IMPACT OF THE VARIABILITY IN EXCHANGE RATES ON ACCOUNTS RECEIVABLE AND COLLECTIONS

DENOMINATED IN CERTAIN FOREIGN CURRENCIES.

SECURITIES PRICE RISK.

STRATEGIC EQUITY INVESTMENTS ARE SUBJECT TO MARKET

PRICE RISK. FROM TIME TO TIME, THE COMPANY USES AND DESIGNATES OPTIONS TO HEDGE FAIR VALUES AND CASH FLOWS ON CERTAIN EQUITY SECURITIES. THE SECURITY, OR FORECASTED SALE THEREOF, SELECTED FOR HEDGING IS DETERMINED BY MARKET CONDITIONS, UP-FRONT

COSTS, AND OTHER RELEVANT FACTORS. ONCE ESTABLISHED, THE HEDGES ARE NOT DYNAMICALLY MANAGED OR TRADED, AND ARE GENERALLY NOT REMOVED UNTIL MATURITY.

INTEREST RATE RISK.

FIXED-INCOME SECURITIES ARE SUBJECT TO INTEREST RATE RISK. THE FIXED-INCOME PORTFOLIO IS DIVERSIFIED AND CONSISTS PRIMARILY OF INVESTMENT GRADE SECURITIES TO MINIMIZE CREDIT RISK. THE

COMPANY ROUTINELY USES OPTIONS, NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS, TO HEDGE ITS EXPOSURE TO INTEREST RATE RISK IN THE EVENT OF A CATASTROPHIC INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES.

OTHER DERIVATIVES.

IN ADDITION, THE COMPANY MAY INVEST IN WARRANTS TO PURCHASE SECURITIES OF OTHER COMPANIES AS A STRATEGIC INVESTMENT. WARRANTS THAT CAN BE NET SHARE SETTLED ARE

DEEMED DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND ARE NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

FOR OPTIONS DESIGNATED EITHER AS FAIR VALUE OR CASH FLOW HEDGES, CHANGES IN

THE TIME VALUE ARE EXCLUDED FROM THE ASSESSMENT OF HEDGE EFFECTIVENESS.

ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS

THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS REFLECTS MANAGEMENTS BEST ESTIMATE OF PROBABLE LOSSES INHERENT IN THE ACCOUNT RECEIVABLE BALANCE. MANAGEMENT DETERMINES THE ALLOWANCE BASED ON KNOWN TROUBLED

ACCOUNTS, HISTORICAL EXPERIENCE, AND OTHER CURRENTLY AVAILABLE EVIDENCE. ACTIVITY IN THE ALLOWANCE FOR DOUBTFUL ACCOUNTS IS AS FOLLOWS.

BEGINNING IN FISCAL 2002 WITH THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS,

GOODWILL IS NO LONGER AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. PRIOR TO FISCAL 2002, GOODWILL WAS AMORTIZED

USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER ITS ESTIMATED PERIOD OF BENEFIT.

INTANGIBLE ASSETS

INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE AMORTIZED USING THE STRAIGHT-LINE METHOD OVER THEIR ESTIMATED PERIOD OF BENEFIT, RANGING FROM THREE TO SEVEN YEARS. THE COMPANY PERIODICALLY EVALUATES THE RECOVERABILITY OF INTANGIBLE ASSETS AND TAKES

INTO ACCOUNT EVENTS OR CIRCUMSTANCES THAT WARRANT REVISED ESTIMATES OF USEFUL LIVES OR THAT INDICATE THAT AN IMPAIRMENT EXISTS. ALL OF MICROSOFTS INTANGIBLE ASSETS ARE SUBJECT TO AMORTIZATION.

RECLASSIFICATIONS

CERTAIN RECLASSIFICATIONS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR CONSISTENT

NOTE 2    ACCOUNTING CHANGES

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2000, THE COMPANY ADOPTED SFAS 133,

ACCOUNTING FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES,

WHICH ESTABLISHES ACCOUNTING AND REPORTING STANDARDS FOR DERIVATIVE

INSTRUMENTS, INCLUDING CERTAIN DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS EMBEDDED IN OTHER CONTRACTS AND FOR HEDGING ACTIVITIES. THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 ON JULY 1, 2000, RESULTED IN A CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX REDUCTION TO INCOME OF $560 MILLION ($375 MILLION AFTER-TAX) AND

A CUMULATIVE PRE-TAX REDUCTION TO OCI OF $112 MILLION ($75 MILLION AFTER-TAX). THE REDUCTION TO INCOME WAS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION RECLASSIFIED FROM OCI FOR THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS AND A LOSS OF APPROXIMATELY

$250 MILLION RECLASSIFIED FROM OCI FOR DERIVATIVES NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE REDUCTION TO OCI WAS MOSTLY ATTRIBUTABLE TO LOSSES OF APPROXIMATELY $670 MILLION ON CASH FLOW HEDGES OFFSET BY RECLASSIFICATIONS OUT OF OCI OF THE

APPROXIMATELY $300 MILLION LOSS FOR THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS AND THE APPROXIMATELY $250 MILLION LOSS FOR DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. THE NET DERIVATIVE LOSSES INCLUDED IN OCI AS OF JULY 1, 2000 WERE RECLASSIFIED

INTO EARNINGS DURING THE TWELVE MONTHS ENDED JUNE 30, 2001. THE CHANGE IN ACCOUNTING FROM THE ADOPTION OF SFAS 133 DID NOT MATERIALLY AFFECT NET INCOME IN 2001.

EFFECTIVE JULY 1, 2001, MICROSOFT ADOPTED SFAS 141,

BUSINESS COMBINATIONS,

AND SFAS 142,

GOODWILL AND OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS.

SFAS 141 REQUIRES BUSINESS COMBINATIONS INITIATED AFTER JUNE 30, 2001 TO BE ACCOUNTED FOR

USING THE PURCHASE METHOD OF ACCOUNTING. IT ALSO SPECIFIES THE TYPES OF ACQUIRED INTANGIBLE ASSETS THAT ARE REQUIRED TO BE RECOGNIZED AND REPORTED SEPARATE FROM GOODWILL. SFAS 142 REQUIRES THAT GOODWILL AND CERTAIN INTANGIBLES NO LONGER BE

AMORTIZED, BUT INSTEAD TESTED FOR IMPAIRMENT AT LEAST ANNUALLY. THERE WAS NO IMPAIRMENT OF GOODWILL UPON ADOPTION OF SFAS 142.

DEBT SECURITIES INCLUDE CORPORATE AND GOVERNMENT NOTES AND BONDS AND

DERIVATIVE SECURITIES. DEBT SECURITIES MATURING BEYOND 15 YEARS ARE COMPOSED ENTIRELY OF AT&T 5% CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED DEBT WITH A CONTRACTUAL MATURITY OF 30 YEARS. THE DEBT IS CONVERTIBLE AT THE COMPANYS OPTION INTO AT&T COMMON STOCK

ON OR AFTER DECEMBER 1, 2000, OR MAY BE REDEEMED BY AT&T UPON SATISFACTION OF CERTAIN CONDITIONS ON OR AFTER JUNE 1, 2002. IN CONNECTION WITH THE DEFINITIVE AGREEMENT TO COMBINE AT&T BROADBAND WITH COMCAST IN A NEW COMPANY TO BE CALLED

AT&T COMCAST CORPORATION, MICROSOFT HAS AGREED TO EXCHANGE ITS AT&T 5% CONVERTIBLE PREFERRED DEBT SECURITIES FOR APPROXIMATELY 115 MILLION SHARES OF AT&T COMCAST CORPORATION. IT IS EXPECTED THAT THE TRANSACTION WILL CLOSE BY DECEMBER 31,

2002. WHILE IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MICROSOFT COULD INCUR A LOSS ON THIS EXCHANGE TRANSACTION UP TO THE CARRYING VALUE OF THE AT&T DEBT SECURITIES, MANAGEMENT BELIEVES THAT THE ULTIMATE LOSS, IF ANY, WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS. AS MANAGEMENT IS

UNABLE TO PREDICT WHETHER THERE WILL BE A GAIN OR LOSS ON THE EXCHANGE, NO LOSS HAS BEEN RECORDED RELATED TO THIS CONTINGENT EXCHANGE TRANSACTION AS OF JUNE 30, 2002.

EQUITY SECURITIES THAT ARE RESTRICTED FOR MORE THAN ONE YEAR OR NOT PUBLICLY TRADED ARE RECORDED AT COST. AT JUNE 30, 2001 THE ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN EXCESS OF THEIR RECORDED BASIS WAS $161 MILLION. AT JUNE 30,

2002 THE RECORDED BASIS OF THESE INVESTMENTS IN EXCESS OF THEIR ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE WAS $34 MILLION. THIS EXCESS OF COST OVER ESTIMATED FAIR VALUE WAS DEEMED TEMPORARY IN NATURE. THE ESTIMATE OF FAIR VALUE IS BASED ON PUBLICLY AVAILABLE MARKET

INFORMATION OR OTHER ESTIMATES DETERMINED BY MANAGEMENT. REALIZED GAINS AND (LOSSES) FROM EQUITY AND OTHER INVESTMENTS (EXCLUDING IMPAIRMENTS DISCUSSED PREVIOUSLY) WERE $1.94 BILLION AND $(10) MILLION IN 2000, $3.03 BILLION AND $(23) MILLION IN

2001, AND $2.24 BILLION AND $(121) MILLION IN 2002.

NOTE 8    GOODWILL

DURING FISCAL 2002, GOODWILL WAS REDUCED BY $85 MILLION, PRINCIPALLY IN CONNECTION WITH MICROSOFTS EXCHANGE OF ALL OF ITS 33.7 MILLION SHARES AND WARRANTS OF

EXPEDIA, INC. TO USA NETWORKS, INC. NO GOODWILL WAS ACQUIRED OR IMPAIRED DURING FISCAL 2002. AS OF JUNE 30, 2002, DESKTOP AND ENTERPRISE SOFTWARE AND SERVICES GOODWILL WAS $1.1 BILLION, CONSUMER SOFTWARE, SERVICES, AND DEVICES GOODWILL WAS $258

MILLION, AND CONSUMER COMMERCE INVESTMENTS GOODWILL WAS $72 MILLION.

NOTE 9    INTANGIBLE ASSETS

DURING FISCAL 2002, CHANGES IN INTANGIBLE ASSETS PRIMARILY RELATES TO THE COMPANYS ACQUISITION OF $25 MILLION IN PATENTS AND LICENSES AND

$27 MILLION IN EXISTING TECHNOLOGY, WHICH WILL BE AMORTIZED OVER APPROXIMATELY 3 YEARS. NO SIGNIFICANT RESIDUAL VALUE IS ESTIMATED FOR THESE INTANGIBLE ASSETS. INTANGIBLE ASSETS AMORTIZATION EXPENSE WAS $202 MILLION FOR FISCAL 2001 AND $194 MILLION

FOR FISCAL 2001, INVESTMENT INCOME INCLUDED A NET UNREALIZED LOSS OF $592 MILLION, COMPRISED OF A $214 MILLION GAIN FOR CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS FOR FAIR VALUE

HEDGES, $211 MILLION LOSS FOR CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES, AND $595 MILLION LOSS FOR CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS. FOR FISCAL 2002, INVESTMENT INCOME INCLUDED

A NET UNREALIZED LOSS OF $480 MILLION, COMPRISED OF A $30 MILLION GAIN FOR CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS FOR FAIR VALUE HEDGES, $331 MILLION LOSS FOR CHANGES IN THE TIME VALUE OF OPTIONS FOR CASH FLOW HEDGES, AND $179 MILLION NET LOSS FOR

CHANGES IN THE FAIR VALUE OF DERIVATIVE INSTRUMENTS NOT DESIGNATED AS HEDGING INSTRUMENTS.

DERIVATIVE GAINS AND LOSSES INCLUDED IN OCI ARE RECLASSIFIED INTO

EARNINGS AT THE TIME FORECASTED REVENUE OR THE SALE OF AN EQUITY INVESTMENT IS RECOGNIZED. DURING FISCAL 2001, $214 MILLION OF DERIVATIVE GAINS WERE RECLASSIFIED TO REVENUE AND $416 MILLION OF DERIVATIVE LOSSES WERE RECLASSIFIED TO INVESTMENT

INCOME/(LOSS). DURING FISCAL 2002, $234 MILLION OF DERIVATIVE GAINS WERE RECLASSIFIED TO REVENUE AND $10 MILLION OF DERIVATIVE LOSSES WERE RECLASSIFIED TO INVESTMENT INCOME/(LOSS). THE DERIVATIVE LOSSES RECLASSIFIED TO INVESTMENT INCOME/(LOSS) WERE

WITHHOLDING TAXES ON $780 MILLION OF ITS UNDISTRIBUTED EARNINGS FOR CERTAIN NON-U.S. SUBSIDIARIES, ALL OF WHICH RELATE TO FISCAL 2002 EARNINGS, SINCE THESE EARNINGS ARE INTENDED TO BE REINVESTED INDEFINITELY.

FINDINGS OF FACT AND CONCLUSIONS OF LAW STATING THAT MICROSOFT HAD VIOLATED SECTIONS 1 AND 2 OF THE SHERMAN ACT AND VARIOUS STATE ANTITRUST LAWS. A JUDGMENT WAS ENTERED ON JUNE 7, 2000 ORDERING, AMONG OTHER THINGS, THE BREAKUP OF MICROSOFT INTO TWO

COMPANIES.

TABLE OF CONTENTS

PART II

ITEM 8

THE JUDGMENT WAS STAYED PENDING AN APPEAL. ON JUNE 28, 2001, THE U.S. COURT OF APPEALS FOR THE DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA CIRCUIT AFFIRMED IN PART, REVERSED IN PART, AND VACATED THE JUDGMENT IN ITS

ENTIRETY AND REMANDED THE CASE TO THE DISTRICT COURT FOR A NEW TRIAL ON ONE SECTION 1 CLAIM AND FOR ENTRY OF A NEW JUDGMENT CONSISTENT WITH ITS RULING. IN ITS RULING, THE COURT OF APPEALS SUBSTANTIALLY NARROWED THE BASES OF LIABILITY FOUND BY THE

DISTRICT COURT, BUT AFFIRMED SOME OF THE DISTRICT COURTS CONCLUSIONS THAT MICROSOFT HAD VIOLATED SECTION 2. ON OCTOBER 12, 2001, THE TRIAL COURT HELD A STATUS CONFERENCE AND ENTERED ORDERS REQUIRING THE PARTIES TO ENGAGE IN SETTLEMENT

DISCUSSIONS UNTIL NOVEMBER 2, 2001.

MICROSOFT ENTERED INTO A SETTLEMENT WITH THE UNITED STATES ON NOVEMBER 2, 2001. NINE STATES (NEW YORK, OHIO, ILLINOIS, KENTUCKY, LOUISIANA, MARYLAND, MICHIGAN, NORTH CAROLINA AND WISCONSIN) AGREED TO

SETTLE ON SUBSTANTIALLY THE SAME TERMS ON NOVEMBER 6, 2001. A HEARING ON THE SETTLEMENT WAS HELD BY THE COURT ON MARCH 6, 2002. THE COURT WILL NOW DECIDE WHETHER TO APPROVE THE SETTLEMENT AS BEING IN THE PUBLIC INTEREST. NINE STATES AND THE DISTRICT

OF COLUMBIA CONTINUE TO LITIGATE THE REMEDIES PHASE OF

U.S. V. MICROSOFT

. THE NON-SETTLING STATES ARE SEEKING IMPOSITION OF A REMEDY THAT WOULD IMPOSE MUCH BROADER RESTRICTIONS ON MICROSOFTS BUSINESS THAN THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT WITH

THE DOJ AND NINE OTHER STATES. THE COURT CONDUCTED AN EVIDENTIARY HEARING RELATED TO THE NON-SETTLING STATES PROPOSED REMEDIES FROM MARCH 18 TO JUNE 19, 2002. A DECISION IS ANTICIPATED LATER IN CALENDAR 2002.

IN OTHER ONGOING INVESTIGATIONS, THE DOJ AND SEVERAL STATE ATTORNEYS GENERAL HAVE REQUESTED INFORMATION FROM MICROSOFT CONCERNING VARIOUS ISSUES. IN ADDITION, THE EUROPEAN COMMISSION

HAS INSTITUTED PROCEEDINGS IN WHICH IT ALLEGES THAT MICROSOFT HAS FAILED TO DISCLOSE INFORMATION THAT MICROSOFT COMPETITORS CLAIM THEY NEED TO INTEROPERATE FULLY WITH WINDOWS 2000 CLIENTS AND SERVERS AND HAS ENGAGED IN DISCRIMINATORY LICENSING OF

SUCH TECHNOLOGY, AS WELL AS IMPROPER BUNDLING OF MULTIMEDIA PLAYBACK TECHNOLOGY IN THE WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM. THE REMEDIES SOUGHT, THOUGH NOT FULLY DEFINED, INCLUDE MANDATORY DISCLOSURE OF MICROSOFT WINDOWS OPERATING SYSTEM TECHNOLOGY AND

IMPOSITION OF FINES. MICROSOFT DENIES THE EUROPEAN COMMISSIONS ALLEGATIONS AND INTENDS TO CONTEST THE PROCEEDINGS VIGOROUSLY.

A LARGE NUMBER OF OVERCHARGE

CLASS ACTION LAWSUITS HAVE BEEN INITIATED AGAINST MICROSOFT IN VARIOUS STATE AND FEDERAL COURTS. THESE CASES ALLEGE THAT MICROSOFT HAS COMPETED UNFAIRLY AND UNLAWFULLY MONOPOLIZED ALLEGED MARKETS FOR OPERATING SYSTEMS AND CERTAIN SOFTWARE

APPLICATIONS AND SEEK TO RECOVER ALLEGED OVERCHARGES THAT THE COMPLAINTS CONTEND MICROSOFT CHARGED FOR THESE PRODUCTS. MICROSOFT BELIEVES THE CLAIMS ARE WITHOUT MERIT AND IS VIGOROUSLY DEFENDING THE CASES. TO DATE, MICROSOFT HAS WON DISMISSALS OF

ALL CLAIMS FOR DAMAGES BY INDIRECT PURCHASERS UNDER FEDERAL LAW AND IN 17 SEPARATE STATE COURT PROCEEDINGS, OF WHICH SEVEN HAVE BEEN AFFIRMED AND ONE HAS BEEN REVERSED. CLAIMS ON BEHALF OF FOREIGN PURCHASERS HAVE ALSO BEEN DISMISSED. APPEALS OF

SEVERAL OF THESE RULINGS ARE STILL PENDING. NO TRIALS OR OTHER PROCEEDINGS HAVE BEEN HELD CONCERNING ANY LIABILITY ISSUES. COURTS IN SEVERAL STATES HAVE RULED THAT THESE CASES MAY PROCEED AS CLASS ACTIONS, WHILE TWO COURTS HAVE DENIED CLASS

CERTIFICATION STATUS TO THE CLAIMS IN THAT STATE PROCEEDING AND ANOTHER HAS RULED THAT NO CLASS ACTION IS AVAILABLE FOR CLAIMS IN THAT STATE. IN FISCAL 2002, THE COMPANY RECORDED A CONTINGENT LIABILITY OF APPROXIMATELY $660 MILLION REPRESENTING

MANAGEMENTS ESTIMATE OF THE COSTS OF RESOLVING THE CONTINGENCY. MANAGEMENTS CONTINGENT LIABILITY ESTIMATE IS BASED UPON A PROPOSED SETTLEMENT BETWEEN MICROSOFT AND LEAD COUNSEL FOR THE FEDERAL PLAINTIFFS. WHILE THE PROPOSED SETTLEMENT
