product development
the software industry is characterized by rapid technological change, which
requires constant attention to computing technology trends, and shifting
consumer demand, and rapid product innovation.  the pace of change is
accelerating as the computing needs of our customers move beyond the pc toward
intelligent devices and appliances.
most of the company's software products are developed internally.  the company
also purchases technology, licenses intellectual property rights, and oversees
third-party development and localization of certain products.  internal
development enables microsoft to maintain closer technical control over its
products and gives the company the freedom to designate which modifications and
enhancements are most important and when they should be implemented.  the
company has created a substantial body of proprietary development tools and has
evolved development methodologies for creating and enhancing its products.
these tools and methodologies are also designed to simplify a product's
portability among different operating systems, microprocessors, or computing
devices.  product documentation is generally created internally.
the company believes that a crucial factor in the success of a new product is
getting it to market quickly to respond to new user needs or advances in
intelligent devices, pcs, servers, and the internet, without compromising
product quality.  the company strives to become informed at the earliest
possible time about changing usage patterns and hardware advances that may
affect software design.  before releasing new software platforms, microsoft
provides to software vendors a range of development, training, testing
resources, and guidelines for developing applications.
to best serve the needs of users around the world, microsoft "localizes" many of
its products to reflect local languages and conventions and to improve the
quality and usability of the product in international markets.  localizing a
product might require modifying the user interface, altering dialog boxes, and
translating text.  in japanese versions, for example, all user messages and
documentation are in japanese with monetary references in the japanese yen.
various microsoft products have been localized into more than 30 languages.
during fiscal years 1999, 2000, and 2001, the company spent $2.97 billion, $3.77
billion, and $4.38 billion, respectively, on product research and development
activities excluding funding of joint venture activity.  those amounts
represented 15.0%, 16.4%, and 17.3%, respectively, of revenue in each of those
years.  the company is committed to continue high expenditures for research and
product development.
microsoft .net is microsoft's platform for xml web services.  xml web services
allow applications to communicate and share data over the internet, regardless
of operating system or programming language.  the microsoft .net platform
includes a comprehensive family of products, built on xml and internet industry
standards, which provide for each aspect of developing, managing, using, and
experiencing xml web services.  there are five areas where microsoft is building
the .net platform today:  tools, servers, xml web services, clients, and .net
experiences.  in the tools area, visual studio .net and the
microsoft .net framework supply a complete solution for developers to build,
deploy, and run xml web services. they maximize the performance, reliability,
and security of xml web services. the .net enterprise servers, including the
windows 2000 server family, make up microsoft .net's server infrastructure for
deploying, managing, and orchestrating xml web services. designed with mission-
critical performance in mind, they provide enterprises with the agility they
need to integrate their systems, applications, and partners through xml web
services, and the flexibility to adapt to changing business requirements.
in addition to developers creating xml web services, microsoft is creating a
core set of building block services that perform routine tasks and act as the
backbone for developers to build upon.  the first set of xml web services being
built, codenamed "hailstorm", is a group of user-centric services oriented
around people, rather than specific devices, networks, or applications.
hailstorm is based upon the microsoft passport user authentication system.  with
hailstorm, users receive relevant information, as they need it, delivered to the
devices they are using, and based on preferences they have established.
clients are pcs, laptops, workstations, phones, handheld computers, tablet pcs,
game consoles, and other smart devices.  these smart clients and devices use
software that supports xml web services, which enable users to access their data
regardless of the location, type, and number of clients used.  smart clients and
devices leverage xml web services to create .net experiences that allow users to
access information across the internet and from stand-alone applications in an
integrated way.  some of the products that microsoft is transitioning into .net
experiences are office, msn, bcentral, and visual studio .net.

outside manufacturers produce various retail software packaged products and
hardware.  there are other custom manufacturers microsoft could use in the event
outsourced manufacturing becomes unavailable from current vendors.
the company's cd-rom manufacturing facilities are located in puerto rico.  the
company has multiple sources for raw materials, supplies, and components and is
often able to acquire component parts and materials on a volume discount basis.
quality control tests are performed on purchased parts, cd-roms, and other
products.
operations
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
microsoft manages all product fulfillment, licensing, and logistics services.
the company has regional operations centers in ireland, singapore, and the
greater seattle area. the regional centers support all operations activities,
including information processing, vendor management, logistics, and related
supporting functions by geographical regions. the regional center in dublin,
ireland supports the european, african, and middle east regions, the center in
singapore supports the asia pacific region, and the center in the greater
seattle area supports north and south america.  microsoft licensing incorporated
(msli), a wholly-owned subsidiary in reno, nevada, manages the company's
original equipment manufacturer (oem) and certain organizational licensing
operations.
marketing and distribution
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the company's sales and marketing group seeks to build long-term relationships
with customers of microsoft.  the oem sales group includes the sales force that
works with original equipment manufacturers that preinstall microsoft software
on their pcs.  in addition to the oem channel, microsoft has three major
geographic sales and marketing organizations: the south pacific and americas;
europe, middle east, and africa; and asia.
finished goods channels
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
distributors and resellers.  the company licenses and sells its products in the
finished goods channels primarily to and through independent non-exclusive
distributors and resellers.  distributors and resellers include ingram micro,
tech data, software spectrum, corporate software & technology, softbank,
software house international, asap software express, and tech pacific group.
microsoft has a network of field sales representatives and field support
personnel who solicit orders from distributors and resellers and provide product
training and sales support.
enterprise accounts.  the microsoft select program offers flexible software
acquisition, licensing, and maintenance options specially customized to meet the
needs of large multinational organizations.  targeted audiences include
technology specialists and influential end users in large enterprises.
marketing efforts and fulfillment are generally coordinated with large account
resellers. the microsoft open program is a licensing program that is targeted
for small- and medium-sized organizations.  it is available through the reseller
channel and offers discounts based on initial purchase volumes.  the microsoft
enterprise agreement program is a licensing program designed to provide a
flexible licensing and service solution tailored to customers making a long-term
licensing commitment. the agreements are designed to increase customer
satisfaction by simplifying license administration, payment terms, and the
contract process.
certified partners.  microsoft certified partners are independent companies that
offer their clients leading-edge technology through consulting, deployment,
remote and on-site maintenance, helpdesk support, packaged software
applications, hosting services, training, and more.  microsoft certified
partners encompass a broad range of expertise and vendor affiliations and have
experience ranging from networking, e-commerce, collaboration, business
intelligence, and other leading edge disciplines.
international sales sites.  the company has established marketing and/or support
subsidiaries in more than 80 countries.  product is generally delivered by the
company's owned or outsourced manufacturing operations, which are located in the
geographical region in which the product was sold.  by organizing
geographically, the company is able to provide service to international channel
customers and access to microsoft professionals located in the same region to
serve their specific needs.  subsidiaries have the responsibility for selling
products to customers, managing licensing programs, and providing support to all
types of customers based in international countries.
the company's international operations, both oem and finished goods, are subject
to certain risks common to foreign operations in general, such as governmental
regulations, import restrictions, and foreign exchange rate fluctuations.
microsoft hedges a portion of its foreign exchange risk.
oem channel
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
microsoft operating systems are licensed primarily to oems under agreements that
grant the oems the right to distribute copies of the company's products with
their computing devices, principally pcs.  the company also markets and licenses
certain server operating systems, desktop applications, hardware devices, and
consumer software programs to oems under similar arrangements.  in almost all
cases, the products are distributed under microsoft trademarks.  the company has
oem agreements covering one or more of its products with virtually all of the
major pc oems, including acer, actebis, compaq, dell, emachines, fujitsu,
fujitsu siemens computers, gateway, hewlett-packard, ibm, micron, nec, samsung,
sony, and toshiba.  a substantial amount of oem business is also conducted with
system builders, which are low-volume customized pc vendors.
advertising
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the company works closely with large advertising and direct marketing firms.
advertising, direct marketing, worldwide packaging, and marketing materials are
targeted to various end-user segments.  the company uses broad consumer media
(television, radio, the internet, and business publications) and trade
publications.  microsoft has programs under which qualifying resellers and oems
are reimbursed for certain advertising expenditures.
customers
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the company's customers include consumers, small- and medium-sized
organizations, enterprises, educational institutions, isps, application
developers, and oems.  most consumers of microsoft products are individuals in
businesses, government agencies, educational institutions, and at home.  the
consumers and organizations obtain microsoft products primarily through
resellers and oems, which include certain microsoft products with their
computing hardware.  the notes to financial statements (see item 8) quantify
customers that represent more than 10% of the company's revenue.  the company's
practice is to ship its products promptly upon receipt of purchase orders from
its customers and, consequently, backlog is not significant.
competition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the software business is intensely competitive and subject to rapid
technological change.  as the company pursues its largest strategic initiative,
microsoft .net, the company could experience more intense competition during the
transition from the traditional core businesses to its new products based on the
.net platform.  the company continues to face movements from pc-based
applications to server-based applications or web-based application hosting
services, from proprietary software to open source software, and from pcs to
internet-based devices.  a number of microsoft's most significant competitors,
including ibm, sun microsystems, oracle, and aol time warner, are collaborating
with one another on various initiatives directed at competing with microsoft.
these initiatives relate in part to efforts to move software from individual pcs
to centrally managed servers, which would present significant challenges to the
company's historical business model.  other competitive collaborative efforts
include the development of new platform technologies that are intended to
replicate much of the value of microsoft windows operating systems.  new
computing form factors, including non-pc information devices, are gaining
popularity and competing with pcs running microsoft's software products.
microsoft faces formidable competition in these new areas and in all areas of
its current business activity, including competition from many companies much
larger than microsoft.  the rapid pace of technological change, particularly in
the area of internet platforms and services, continually creates new
opportunities for existing competitors and start-ups and can quickly render
existing technologies less valuable.  the company also faces relentless
competition from software pirates who unlawfully copy and distribute microsoft's
copyrighted software products, depriving the company of large amounts of revenue
on an annual basis.
the company's competitive position may be adversely affected by one or more of
the following factors in the future, particularly in view of the fast pace of
technological change in the computing industry.
desktop and enterprise software and services
--------------------------------------------
the company's competitors include many software application vendors, such as ibm
(lotus), oracle, apple (filemaker, inc.), sun microsystems, corel, qualcomm, and
local application developers in europe and asia.  ibm and corel have large
installed bases with their spreadsheet and word processor products,
respectively, and both have aggressive pricing strategies.  also, ibm and apple
preinstall certain of their application software products on various models of
their pcs, competing directly with microsoft's desktop application software.
sun microsystems' star office is also very aggressive with its pricing, offering
a free download from the web or nominal charge for a cd.  additionally, web-
based application hosting services provide an alternative to pc-based
applications such as microsoft office.
microsoft's operating system products face substantial competition from a wide
variety of companies.  competitors such as ibm, apple computer, sun
microsystems, and others are vertically integrated in both software development
and hardware manufacturing and have developed operating systems that they
preinstall on their own computers.  many of these operating system software
products are also licensed to third-party oems for preinstallation on their
computers.  microsoft's operating system products compete with unix-based
operating systems from a wide range of companies, including ibm, hewlett-
packard, sun
microsystems, and others. variants of unix run on a wide variety of computer
platforms and have gained increasing acceptance as desktop operating systems.
with increased attention toward open source software, the linux operating system
has gained increasing acceptance as well. several computer manufacturers
preinstall linux on pc servers and many leading software developers have written
applications that run on linux. microsoft windows operating systems are also
threatened by alternative platforms such as those based on internet browsing
software and java technology promoted by aol time warner and sun microsystems.
the company competes in the business of providing enterprise-wide computing
solutions with several competitors who enjoy a larger share of sales and larger
installed bases.  many companies offer operating system software for mainframes
and midrange computers, including ibm, hewlett-packard, and sun microsystems.
since legacy business systems are typically support-intensive, these competitors
also offer substantial support services.  software developers that provide
competing server applications for pc-based distributed client/server
environments include oracle, ibm, computer associates, sybase, and informix.
there are also several software vendors who offer connectivity servers.  as
mentioned above, there are numerous companies and organizations that offer
internet and intranet server software, which compete against the company's
business systems.  additionally, ibm has a large installed base of lotus notes
and cc:mail, both of which compete with the company's collaboration and e-mail
products.
the company's developer products compete against offerings from borland,
macromedia, oracle, sun microsystems, sybase, symantec, and other companies.
consumer software, services, and devices
----------------------------------------
microsoft's online services network, msn, faces formidable competition from aol
time warner (including its compuserve unit), yahoo!, and a vast array of web
sites and portals that offer content of all types and e-mail, instant messaging,
calendaring, chat, and search and shopping services, among other things.  in
addition, the ease of entry into internet services has allowed numerous web-
based service companies to build significant businesses in areas such as e-mail,
electronic commerce, web search engines, directories, and information of
numerous types.  competitors include aol time warner, yahoo!, excite, lycos,
infoseek, altavista, and many others.  the company's msnbc joint ventures face
considerable competition from other 24-hour cable and internet news
organizations such as cnn, cnn headline news, and fox news network.  msnbc also
competes with traditional news media such as newspapers, magazines, and
broadcast tv.
the company's consumer group continues to see consolidation across the various
entertainment and productivity segments in which microsoft competes.
competitors include vivendi (havas), intuit, electronic arts, the learning
company, infogrammes, and logitech.  still other competitors own branded
content, such as disney and lucasarts.
additionally, pc-based games and the company's future xbox compete and will
compete head-to-head against games created for proprietary systems such as the
nintendo gamecube and the sony playstation.  game developers like electronic
arts, namco, midway, activision, konami, thq, to name a few, are both partners
and competitors in the games software development segment.
microsoft faces many competitors in the mobile devices space, including palm,
symbian, nokia, and openwave.  the embedded operating system market is highly
fragmented with many competitive offerings.  key competitors include wind river
and versions of embeddable linux from commercial linux vendors such as red hat,
lineo, and monta vista.  the largest competitor remains in-house operating
systems developed by device manufacturers.  however, this is changing as more
device builders opt for commercial offerings as connectivity and richer features
are required in devices.
consumer commerce investments
-----------------------------
in the united states, expedia, inc. competes with traditional travel
distribution channels and online travel services such as travelocity.com, hotel
reservations network, priceline.com, cheaptickets.com, biztravel.com,
worldres.com, and trip.com.  expedia also competes with supplier-owned sites
such as united.com, delta.com, and marriott.com.  in addition, two new
competitors owned by various airlines, orbitz and hotwire, emerged in fiscal
year 2001.  internationally, expedia competes with a different set of
participants in each market.  microsoft faces many competitors in the online
real estate service space, including aol's house and home channel and homestore.
the company also faces many competitors in the online automotive service space,
including autobytel, carsdirect, aol autos, and yahoo! autos.
other
-----
pc input devices face substantial competition from computer manufacturers, since
computers are typically sold with a keyboard and mouse, and other manufacturers
of these devices.  microsoft press competes in the retail book and elearning
markets with publishers that also create content on microsoft technologies.  a
few of the retail competitors are pearson, wrox, sybex, and wiley.  the major
elearning competitors are smartforce and netg.
employees
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
as of june 30, 2001, the company employed approximately 47,600 people on a full-
time basis, 33,000 in the united states and 14,600 internationally.  of the
total, 19,400 were in product research and development, 22,500 in sales,
marketing, and support, 1,900 in manufacturing and distribution, and 3,800 in
finance and administration.  microsoft's success is highly dependent on its
ability to attract and retain qualified employees.  competition for employees is
intense in the software industry.  to date, the company believes it has been
successful in its efforts to recruit qualified employees, but there is no
assurance that it will continue to be as successful in the future.  none of the
company's employees is subject to collective bargaining agreements.  the company
believes relations with its employees are excellent.
item 2.  properties
the company's corporate offices consist of approximately 7.9 million square feet
of office building space located in king county, washington.  the company is
constructing three buildings with approximately 720,000 square feet of space
that will be occupied in the fall of 2001.  the company owns 4.8 million square

item 7.  management's discussion and analysis of results of operations and
financial condition
results of operations for 1999, 2000, and 2001
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
microsoft develops, manufactures, licenses, and supports a wide range of
software products for a multitude of computing devices.  microsoft software
includes scalable operating systems for servers, personal computers (pcs), and
intelligent devices; server applications for client/server environments;
knowledge worker productivity applications; and software development tools.  the
company's online efforts include the msn network of internet products and
services and alliances with companies involved with broadband access and various
forms of digital interactivity.  microsoft also licenses consumer software
programs; sells hardware devices; provides consulting services; trains and
certifies system integrators and developers; and researches and develops
advanced technologies for future software products.
management's discussion and analysis contains statements that are forward-
looking.  these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions
that are subject to risks and uncertainties.  actual results could differ
materially because of factors discussed below under "issues and uncertainties."
revenue
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the company's revenue growth rate was 29% in fiscal 1999, 16% in fiscal 2000,
and 10% in fiscal 2001.  revenue growth in fiscal 2001 was driven primarily by
licensing of microsoft windows 2000 professional, microsoft sql server, and the
other .net enterprise servers.  consumer software, services, and devices revenue
also grew strongly.  partially offsetting those items was flat revenue growth
from windows millennium edition (windows me) and windows 98 operating systems,
reflecting the slowdown in consumer pc shipments and a higher mix of windows
2000 professional and windows nt workstation.  revenue growth in fiscal 2000 was
driven by strong licensing of microsoft windows nt workstation, windows 2000
professional, windows nt server, windows 2000 server, microsoft office 2000, and
sql server.  consumer software, services, and devices revenue also grew
strongly.  partially offsetting those items was slower growth from windows
operating systems sold through the original equipment manufacturer (oem) channel
due to slow demand for business pcs throughout a significant portion of fiscal
2000.  revenue growth in fiscal 1999 reflected the continued adoption of windows
operating systems and microsoft office.  in addition, the company's estimate for
future product returns was reduced by $250 million in fiscal 1999.
in fiscal 1999, microsoft made two changes related to the ratable recognition of
revenue for a portion of its revenue for certain products.  american institute
of certified public accountants (aicpa) statement of position (sop) 98-9,
modification of sop 97-2, software revenue recognition, with respect to certain
transactions, requires companies to use the average sales price of each
undelivered element of software arrangements to unbundle revenue.  prior
authoritative accounting guidance allowed a comparison of the total price
differential between a licensed product sold through different channels of
distribution to derive the value of undelivered elements offered to customers
acquiring product from one channel but not the other.  upon adoption of this new
rule in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, the percentages of the total
arrangement treated as unearned decreased.  this change reduced the amount of
microsoft windows and microsoft office sales treated as unearned and increased
the amount of revenue recognized upon shipment.  additionally, as part of the
company's long range planning process and a review of product shipment cycles,
it was determined that the life cycle of windows should be extended from two
years to three years.
product revenue
microsoft has four segments:  desktop and enterprise software and services;
consumer software, services, and devices; consumer commerce investments; and
other.  the management discussion and analysis presentation of revenue differs
from that reported under the company's segment information appearing in the
notes to financial statements because reconciling items are allocated to those
segments.
desktop and enterprise software and services
desktop and enterprise software and services revenue was $17.84 billion, $20.40
billion, and $22.41 billion in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  desktop and enterprise
software and services includes desktop applications; desktop platforms; and
enterprise software and services.
desktop applications revenue was $7.77 billion, $9.30 billion, and $9.54 billion
in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  desktop applications includes revenue from microsoft
office; microsoft project; visio; client access licenses (cals) for windows nt
server and windows 2000 server, exchange, and backoffice; microsoft great
plains; and bcentral.  in fiscal 2001, revenue from client access licenses
increased 14% reflecting strong licensing growth of windows nt server and
windows 2000 server cals.  office revenue growth was flat during the year.  in
fiscal 2000 and 1999, revenue growth from microsoft office integrated suites,
including the premium, professional, small business, and standard editions were
very solid.
desktop platforms revenue was $6.74 billion, $7.02 billion, and $8.04 billion in
1999, 2000, and 2001.  desktop platforms includes revenue from windows 2000
professional, windows nt workstation, windows me, windows 98, and other desktop
operating systems.  fiscal 2001 revenue growth reflected the strong adoption of
windows 2000 professional, partially offset by flat revenue growth from windows
me and windows 98 operating systems, reflecting the slowdown in consumer pc
shipments and a higher mix of windows 2000 professional and windows nt
workstation.  in fiscal 2000, desktop platforms revenue growth was modest due to
soft demand for business pcs during most of the year; a slowdown in shipments in
anticipation of the post mid-year availability of windows 2000 operating
systems; and, as expected, a longer business migration cycle for the newest
windows operating system offerings.  in fiscal 1999, windows units licensed
through the oem channel, particularly windows nt workstation, increased strongly
over the prior year.  organizational licensing of windows nt workstation and
windows 98 also contributed to the growth.
enterprise software and services revenue was $3.33 billion, $4.08 billion, and
$4.83 billion in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  enterprise software and services
includes enterprise platforms, server applications, developer tools and
services, and enterprise services.  as a result of the continued adoption of
microsoft's .net enterprise server offerings in fiscal 2001, server applications
revenue increased 31% versus the prior year.  enterprise services revenue,
representing consulting and product support services, was up 34% compared to
fiscal 2000.  enterprise platforms, which includes windows 2000 server and
windows nt server operating systems, increased 10% while revenue from developer
tools and services was flat with the prior year.  in fiscal 2000, enterprise
platforms revenue growth was particularly strong led by increased adoption by
customers of windows nt server and windows 2000 server.  revenue from server
applications grew strongly, largely due to the strong success of sql server 7.0.
software developer tools and services revenue declined, due to increased suite
licensing versus stand-alone licenses, and the lack of a release upgrade of the
visual studio development system.  in fiscal 1999, the revenue growth rate for
windows nt server was healthy.  revenue from server applications grew strongly,
reflecting, in part, the release of sql server 7.0.  the visual studio 6.0
development system drove healthy developer tools and services revenue growth.
consulting services revenue rose substantially.
consumer software, services, and devices
consumer software, services, and devices revenue was $1.19 billion, $1.63
billion, and $1.95 billion in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  consumer software,
services, and devices includes msn internet access; msn network service; webtv
internet access and services; pc and online games; learning and productivity
software; mobile and wireless devices; and embedded systems.  in fiscal 2001,
revenue from msn network services grew strongly in light of the decline in the
online advertising market.  msn internet access revenue also grew solidly as a
result of an increased subscriber base, partially offset by a decline in the
average revenue per subscriber due to a larger mix of subscribers contracted
under rebate programs.  revenue from embedded systems grew strongly from the
prior year, while learning and productivity software revenue and pc and online
games revenue declined, reflecting softness in the overall consumer market.  in
fiscal 2000, online revenue growth was very strong and reflected higher
subscriber totals, offset by lower net prices for internet access subscriptions
compared to the prior year.  additionally, strong sell-through of entertainment
software produced robust revenue growth.  in fiscal 1999, online advertising
revenue rose substantially and internet access revenue increased moderately.
consumer commerce investments
consumer commerce investments revenue was $62 million, $182 million, and $299
million in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  consumer commerce investments include expedia,
inc., the homeadvisor online real estate service, and the carpoint online
automotive service.  acquisitions of travelscape.com and vacationspot.com by
expedia, inc., and increased product offerings from expedia led to the strong
revenue growth in fiscal 2001.  the increased overall reach of all properties
led to the strong revenue growth in fiscal 2000 and 1999.
on july 16, 2001, usa networks, inc. (usa) announced an agreement to acquire a
controlling interest in expedia through the purchase of up to 37.5 million
shares, approximately 75% of the current outstanding shares.  if holders of more
than 37.5 million expedia shares elect to sell their shares to usa, there will
be a pro rata reduction among all electing shareholders.  microsoft has agreed
to transfer all of its 33.7 million shares and warrants, subject to pro-ration.
it is expected that the transaction will close by december 31, 2001.
other
other revenue was $653 million, $754 million, and $630 million in 1999, 2000,
and 2001.  other primarily includes hardware and microsoft press.  lower sales
of gaming devices and other hardware peripherals as a result of weakness in the
consumer market caused the decline in revenue in fiscal 2001.  continued success
of the company's new hardware device offerings led to the revenue growth in
fiscal 2000.  revenue from hardware devices and microsoft press was relatively
flat in fiscal 1999.
distribution channels
microsoft distributes its products primarily through oem licenses,
organizational licenses, online services and products, and retail packaged
products.  oem channel revenue represents license fees from original equipment
manufacturers who preinstall microsoft products, primarily on pcs.  microsoft
has three major geographic sales and marketing regions: the south pacific and
americas region; the europe, middle east, and africa region; and the asia
region.  sales of organizational licenses and packaged products via these
channels are primarily to and through distributors and resellers.
oem revenue was $6.40 billion in 1999, $7.01 billion in 2000, and $7.86 billion
in 2001.  although total licenses were impacted by a slowdown in pc shipments in
fiscal 2001, the mix of the higher priced windows 2000 professional and windows
nt workstation in the oem channel increased substantially resulting in higher
average revenue per license.  the relatively low growth rate in fiscal 2000 was
due to lower business pc shipment growth, especially as a result of the soft
demand for business pcs and component shortages for part of the year.  these
issues combined with post mid-year availability of windows 2000 professional
resulted in lower revenue growth.  average earned revenue per license also
declined compared to the prior year, due in part to a mix shift to the lower-
priced windows 98 operating system reflecting the softness in demand for
business pcs and lower prices on operating systems licensed through certain oem
channel sectors.  in fiscal 1999, pc shipment growth coupled with an increased
penetration of higher value 32-bit operating systems drove the oem revenue
increases.
south pacific and americas region revenue was $7.25 billion, $8.33 billion, and
$9.52 billion in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  in fiscal 2001, revenue growth,
principally in the united states, was led by strong licensing of windows 2000
professional and the family of .net enterprise servers, particularly sql server
2000 and exchange 2000 server.  revenue from enterprise services and msn
subscription and services grew strongly.  in fiscal 2000, office 2000 integrated
suites, windows 2000 server, online revenue, and sql server sales were the
primary drivers of the revenue growth.  strong retail sales of hardware devices
and consumer software also contributed to the growth over the prior year.
revenue growth was particularly strong in latin america and australia, moderate
in canada, and modest in the united states.  in fiscal 1999, server
applications, windows nt server, windows nt workstation, and microsoft office
all exhibited solid year-over-year growth rates.  organizational licensing
activity was strong.  revenue growth was solid in the united states and moderate
in latin america and the south pacific.
europe, middle east, and africa region revenue was $4.33 billion, $5.02 billion,
and $4.86 billion in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  in fiscal 2001, weakening local
currencies negatively impacted translated revenue compared to the prior year.
revenue in the region would have increased 6% if foreign exchange rates were
constant with those of the prior year.  revenue from windows 2000 professional
and the .net enterprise server family of products was very healthy.  in fiscal
2000, retail sales of windows operating systems and office licensing produced
moderate growth in the region.  growth from sql server licensing, new
hardware device offerings, and entertainment software was especially strong.
revenue growth, measured in constant dollars, was very healthy in germany and
italy, robust in the middle east, and low in the united kingdom. in fiscal 1999,
all major products grew strongly over the prior year. revenue growth was solid
in the united kingdom, germany, and france, and was particularly high in sweden,
the netherlands, and spain.
asia region revenue was $1.78 billion in 1999, $2.60 billion in 2000, and $3.06
billion in 2001.  in fiscal 2001, the region's growth rate reflected strong
revenue from localized versions of microsoft office 2000 and microsoft office
xp, especially the office personal suite.  the growth was also attributable to
windows 2000 professional and .net server applications licensing.  revenue
growth was particularly strong in korea and the greater china region, resulting
from advantageous economic conditions as well as successful anti-piracy efforts.
in fiscal 2000, the region's growth rate reflected strong performance resulting
from improved local economic conditions.  revenue growth was also influenced by
robust growth of localized versions of microsoft office 2000, especially the
office personal edition sold in japan, windows platform and server licensing,
and strong adoption of sql server.  revenue grew strongly in nearly all
countries in the asia region.  in fiscal 1999, japan, taiwan, china, hong kong,
and southeast asia had moderate revenue growth, while revenue grew very strongly
in korea.
the company's operating results are affected by foreign exchange rates.
approximately 29%, 30%, and 27% of the company's revenue was collected in
foreign currencies during 1999, 2000, and 2001.  since a portion of local
currency revenue is hedged and much of the company's international manufacturing
costs and operating expenses are also incurred in local currencies, the impact
of exchange rates is partially mitigated.
operating expenses
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
cost of revenue
cost of revenue as a percent of revenue was 14.3% in 1999, 13.1% in 2000, and
13.7% in 2001.  in fiscal 2001, higher support and service costs associated with
the msn internet access and msn network services were partially offset by the
lower relative costs associated with organizational licensing and the drop in
the mix of packaged product versus the prior year.  cost of revenue in fiscal
2000 reflected lower costs associated with webtv networks' operations, partially
offset by the growth in hardware peripherals costs.  cost of revenue as a
percentage of revenue decreased in fiscal 1999 primarily due to the trend in mix
shift to oem and organizational licenses.  additionally, cost of revenue in 1999
was positively impacted by a reduction in estimates of obsolete inventory and
other manufacturing costs of $67 million.
research and development
microsoft continued to invest heavily in the future by funding research and
development (r&d;).  in fiscal 2001, the increase in r&d; expense was the result
of higher headcount-related costs and investments in new product initiatives.
the increase in fiscal 2000 was driven primarily by higher headcount-related
costs.  the increase in fiscal 1999 reflected higher development headcount-
related costs offset by lower infrastructure and third-party development costs.
sales and marketing
in fiscal 2001, sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of revenue
increased due to higher relative headcount-related costs, higher marketing and
sales expenses associated with msn, the microsoft agility advertising campaign,
and other new sales initiatives.  in fiscal 2000, sales and marketing expenses
as a percentage of revenue increased due to higher relative marketing costs
associated with new product releases and online marketing.  in fiscal 1999,
sales and marketing expense as a percentage of revenue decreased due to lower
relative sales expenses and lower relative marketing costs.
general and administrative
in fiscal 2001, general and administrative costs decreased due to a charge
related to the settlement of the lawsuit with caldera, inc. recorded in fiscal
2000.  excluding this charge, general and administrative expenses in fiscal 2001
increased from the prior year due to higher headcount-related costs and legal
fees.  for fiscal 2000, besides the settlement of the lawsuit, general and
administrative expenses also reflected increased legal fees and certain employee
stock option-related expenses.  the increase in fiscal year 1999 was
attributable to higher legal fees, settlement costs, and headcount-related costs
necessary to support the company's expanding operations.
non-operating items, investment income/(loss), and income taxes
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
losses on equity investees and other incorporates microsoft's share of income or
loss from the msnbc entities, avanade, wireless knowledge, starband
communications, and other investments accounted for using the equity method.
the increase in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal 2001 reflects an
increase in the number of such investments during the year.  in fiscal 2000 and
1999, losses on equity investees decreased reflecting smaller losses from the
msnbc entities.
in fiscal 2001, the company reported an investment loss of $36 million, a
decrease in investment income of $3.36 billion versus fiscal 2000.  net
recognized losses were $2.22 billion in fiscal 2001, reflecting $4.80 billion in
impairments of certain investments, primarily in the cable and telecommunication
industries, and $592 million of net losses attributable to derivative
instruments.  these losses were partially offset by higher net gains from the
sales of investments, including a gain from microsoft's investment in titus
communications (which was merged with jupiter telecommunications) and the
closing of the sale of transpoint to checkfree holdings corp.  interest and
dividend income increased $591 million from the prior year, reflecting a larger
investment portfolio.  in fiscal years 2000 and 1999, investment income
increased primarily as a result of a larger investment portfolio generated by
cash from operations coupled with realized gains from the sale of securities.
the effective tax rate for fiscal 2001 was 33%.  the effective tax rate for
fiscal 2000 was 34%.  excluding the impact of the gain on the sale of softimage,
inc., the effective tax rate for fiscal 1999 was 35%.
accounting change
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
effective july 1, 2000, microsoft adopted statement of financial accounting
standards (sfas) 133, accounting for derivative instruments and hedging
activities, which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative
instruments, including certain derivative instruments embedded in other
contracts and for hedging activities.  all derivatives, whether designated in
hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded on the balance sheet
at fair value.  if the derivative is designated as a fair value hedge, the
changes in the fair value of the derivative and the hedged item are recognized
in earnings.  if the derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, changes in
the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income
(oci) and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects
earnings.
the adoption of sfas 133 resulted in a cumulative pre-tax reduction to income of
$560 million ($375 million after-tax) and a cumulative pre-tax reduction to oci
of $112 million ($75 million after-tax).  the reduction to income was mostly
attributable to a loss of approximately $300 million reclassified from oci for
the time value of options and a loss of approximately $250 million reclassified
from oci for derivatives not designated as hedging instruments.  the reduction
to oci was mostly attributable to losses of approximately $670 million on cash
flow hedges offset by the reclassifications out of oci of the approximately $300
million loss for the time value of options and the approximately $250 million
loss for derivative instruments not designated as hedging instruments.
financial condition
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
the company's cash and short-term investment portfolio totaled $31.60 billion at
june 30, 2001.  the portfolio consists primarily of fixed-income securities,
diversified among industries and individual issuers.  microsoft's investments
are generally liquid and investment grade.  the portfolio is invested
predominantly in u.s. dollar denominated securities, but also includes foreign
currency positions in order to diversify financial risk.  the portfolio is
primarily invested in short-term securities to minimize interest rate risk and
facilitate rapid deployment for immediate cash needs.
cash flow from operations was $13.42 billion in fiscal 2001, an increase of
$2.00 billion from the prior year.  the increase was primarily attributable to
the growth in revenue and other changes in working capital, partially offset by
the decrease in the stock option income tax benefit, reflecting decreased stock
option exercises by employees.  cash used for financing was $5.59 billion in
fiscal 2001, an increase of $3.39 billion from the prior year.  the increase
primarily reflects the repurchase of put warrants in fiscal 2001, compared to
the sale of put warrants in the prior fiscal year, as well as an increase in
common stock repurchased.  all outstanding put warrants were either retired or
exercised during fiscal 2001.  during fiscal
2001, the company repurchased 89.0 million shares. cash used for investing was
$8.73 billion in fiscal 2001, a decrease of $658 million from the prior year.
in fiscal 2000, cash flow from operations was $11.43 billion, a decrease of $720
million from the prior year, reflecting working capital changes partially offset
by the increase in the stock option income tax benefit.  cash used for financing
was $2.19 billion in fiscal 2000, an increase of $1.33 billion from the prior
year, reflecting an increase in common stock repurchased versus the prior year.
during fiscal 2000, the company repurchased 55.2 million shares.  cash used for
investing was $9.39 billion in fiscal 2000, a decrease of $808 million from the
prior year.  in fiscal 1999, cash flow from operations was $12.15 billion, an
increase of $3.78 billion from the prior year, reflecting the growth in revenue
and the increase in the stock option income tax benefit.  cash used for
financing was $862 million in fiscal 1999, a decrease of $137 million from the
prior year.  during fiscal 1999, the company repurchased 44.9 million shares.
cash used for investing was $10.20 billion in fiscal 1999, an increase of $3.00
billion from the prior year, reflecting the growth in the investment portfolio.
microsoft has no material long-term debt.  stockholders' equity at june 30, 2001
was $47.29 billion.  microsoft will continue to invest in sales, marketing, and
product support infrastructure.  additionally, research and development
activities will include investments in existing and advanced areas of
technology, including using cash to acquire technology.  additions to property
and equipment will continue, including new facilities and computer systems for
r&d;, sales and marketing, support, and administrative staff.  commitments for
constructing new buildings were $181 million on june 30, 2001.  cash will also
be used for strategic opportunities.
in addition, cash will be used to repurchase common stock to provide shares for
employee stock option and purchase plans.  since fiscal 1990, microsoft has
repurchased 854 million common shares while 2.12 billion shares were issued
under the company's employee stock option and purchase plans.  the market value
of all outstanding stock options was $66 billion as of june 30, 2001.  during
december 1996, microsoft issued 12.5 million shares of 2.75% convertible
exchangeable preferred stock.  the company's convertible preferred stock matured
on december 15, 1999.  each preferred share was converted into 1.1273 common
shares.
management believes existing cash and short-term investments together with funds
generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements.
the company's cash and short-term investments are available for strategic
investments, mergers and acquisitions, and other potential large-scale needs and
to fund the share repurchase program.  microsoft has not paid cash dividends on
its common stock.
recently issued accounting standards
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
in june 2001, the financial accounting standards board issued sfas 141, business
combinations, and sfas 142, goodwill and other intangible assets.  sfas 141
requires business combinations initiated after june 30, 2001 to be accounted for
using the purchase method of accounting.  it also specifies the types of
acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported
separately from goodwill.  sfas 142 will require that goodwill and certain
intangibles no longer be amortized, but instead tested for impairment at least
annually.  sfas 142 is required to be applied starting with fiscal years
beginning after december 15, 2001, with early application permitted in certain
circumstances.  the company plans to early adopt sfas 142 in fiscal 2002 and
does not expect any impairment of goodwill upon adoption.  goodwill amortization
was approximately $300 million in fiscal 2001 and approximately $225 million in
fiscal 2000.
issues and uncertainties
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
while microsoft management is optimistic about the company's long-term
prospects, the following issues and uncertainties, among others, should be
considered in evaluating its growth outlook.
rapid technological change and competition
rapid change, uncertainty due to new and emerging technologies, and fierce
competition characterize the software industry, which means that microsoft's
market position is always at risk.  microsoft's ability to maintain its current
market share may depend upon the company's ability to satisfy customer
requirements, enhance existing products, develop and introduce new products and
achieve market acceptance of such products.  this process grows more challenging
as the pace of change continues to accelerate.  open source
software, new computing devices, new microprocessor architectures, the internet,
and web-based computing models are among the competitive challenges the company
must meet. if microsoft does not successfully identify new product opportunities
and develop and bring new products to market in a timely and cost-efficient
manner, the company's business growth will suffer and demand for its products
will decrease.
future initiatives
the company plans to continue to make significant investments in software
research and development including microsoft .net, "hailstorm", xbox, wireless
technologies, digital devices, television, and small business.  it is
anticipated that these investments in research and development will increase
over historical spending levels.  significant revenue from these product
opportunities may not be achieved for a number of years, if at all.
pc growth rates
the nature of the pc marketplace is changing in ways that may reduce microsoft's
software sales and revenue growth.  overall market demand for pcs can
significantly impact microsoft's revenue growth.  recently, manufacturers have
sought to reach more consumers by developing and producing lower cost pcs - pcs
that come without pre-installed software or contain software with reduced
functionality.  in addition to the influx of low-cost pcs, a market for handheld
computing and communication devices has developed.  while these devices are not
as powerful or versatile as pcs, they threaten to erode sales growth in the
market for pcs with pre-installed software.  this may affect microsoft's revenue
growth because manufacturers may choose not to install microsoft software in
these low-cost pcs or consumers may purchase alternative intelligent devices
that do not use microsoft software.  these lower-priced devices require
microsoft to provide lower-priced software with a subset of the original
functionality.  as a result, the company may generate less revenue from the sale
of software produced for these devices than from the sale of software for pcs.
product development
the software industry is inherently complex.  new products and product
enhancements can require long development and testing periods.  significant
delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products
could damage microsoft's business.  the company anticipates that windows xp and
xbox will be released in fiscal 2002.  delays in either product may adversely
affect revenue and net income.
prices
the competitive factors described above may require microsoft to lower product
prices to meet competition, reducing the company's revenue and net income.
earnings process
an increasingly higher percentage of the company's revenue is subject to ratable
recognition, which impacts the timing of revenue and earnings recognition.
ratable revenue recognition may be required for additional products, depending
on specific license terms and conditions.  also, maintenance and new
subscription programs are increasing in popularity.
employee compensation
microsoft employees currently receive salaries, incentive bonuses, other
benefits, and stock options.  new government regulations, poor stock price
performance, or other factors could diminish the value of the option program to
current and prospective employees and require the company to pay higher salaries
and other cash compensation.
international operations
microsoft develops and sells products throughout the world.  the prices of the
company's products in countries outside of the united states are generally
higher than the company's prices in the united states because of the cost
incurred in localizing software for non-u.s. markets.  the costs of producing
and selling the company's products in these countries are also higher.  pressure
to globalize microsoft's pricing structure might require that the company reduce
the sales price of its software in other countries, even though the costs of the
software continue to be higher than in the united states.  unfavorable changes
in software "piracy" trade protection laws, policies and measures, and other
regulatory requirements affecting trade and investment; unexpected changes in
regulatory requirements for software; social, political, labor, or economic
conditions in a specific country or region; difficulties in staffing and
managing foreign
operations; and potential adverse foreign tax consequences; among other factors,
could also have an impact on the company's business and results of operations
outside of the united states.
intellectual property rights
microsoft diligently defends its intellectual property rights, but unlicensed
copying of software represents a loss of revenue to the company.  while this
adversely affects u.s. revenue, revenue loss is even more significant outside of
the united states, particularly in countries where laws are less protective of
intellectual property rights.  throughout the world, microsoft actively educates
consumers on the benefits of licensing genuine products and educates lawmakers
on the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are
protected.  however, continued efforts may not affect revenue positively.
litigation
litigation regarding intellectual property rights, patents, and copyrights
occurs in the software industry.  in addition, there are government regulation
and investigation risks along with other general corporate legal risks.  the
company is a defendant in a lawsuit filed by the antitrust division of the u.s.
department of justice and a group of eighteen state attorneys general alleging
violations of the sherman act and various state antitrust laws.  after the
trial, the district court entered findings of fact and conclusions of law
stating that microsoft had violated sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act and
various state antitrust laws.  a judgment was entered on june 7, 2000 ordering,
among other things, the breakup of microsoft into two companies.  the judgment
was stayed pending an appeal.  on june 28, 2001, the u.s. court of appeals for
the district of columbia circuit affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated
the judgment in its entirety and remanded the case to the district court for a
new trial on one section 1 claim and for entry of a new judgment consistent with
its ruling.  in its ruling, the court of appeals substantially narrowed the
bases of liability found by the district court, but affirmed some of the
district court's conclusions that microsoft had violated section 2.  on
september 6, 2001, the plaintiffs announced that on remand they will not ask the
court to break microsoft up, that they will seek imposition of conduct remedies,
and that they will not retry the one section 1 claim returned to the district
court by the court of appeals.  on august 7, 2001, microsoft petitioned the
supreme court for a writ of certiorari to review the appellate court's ruling
concerning its disqualification of the district court judge.  microsoft may
petition the supreme court to review other aspects of the appellate court's
decision after final judgment is entered.  in response to the court of appeal's
decision, microsoft has modified the terms of its agreements with computer
manufacturers to permit them to remove internet explorer icons from windows when
the manufacturer wants to promote an alternative browser, and modifying other
provisions of the agreements.  while the company cannot predict with certainty
the final outcome of this matter, its resolution may result in additional
changes to the company's business practices and could affect how the company
develops and markets new products and services.  in addition, while the court of
appeals ruling vacated the remedies portion of the judgment in its entirety, it
is possible the district court could enter a new judgment providing for certain
remedies that would have a material adverse effect on the company if the company
cannot obtain relief from such provisions on appeal.
a large number of antitrust class action lawsuits have been initiated against
microsoft. these cases allege that microsoft has competed unfairly and
unlawfully monopolized alleged markets for operating systems and certain
software applications and seek to recover alleged overcharges that the
complaints contend microsoft charged for these products. although microsoft
believes the claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the cases, the
company cannot predict with certainty the outcome of these lawsuits.
future growth rate
the revenue growth rate in 2002 may not approach the level attained in prior
years. because of the fixed nature of a significant portion of operating
expenses, coupled with the possibility of slower revenue growth, operating
margins in 2002 may decrease from those in 2001. in addition, with the
anticipated introduction of xbox in fiscal 2002, cost of revenue as a percentage
of revenue may increase versus prior years.
item 7a.  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk
the company is exposed to foreign currency, interest rate, and securities price
risks.  a portion of these risks is hedged, but fluctuations could impact the
company's results of operations and financial position.
the company hedges the exposure of accounts receivable and a portion of
anticipated revenue to foreign currency fluctuations, primarily with option
contracts. the company monitors its foreign currency exposures daily to maximize
the overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions. principal
currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian
dollar. fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk. the portfolio
is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities to minimize
credit risk. the company routinely uses options to hedge its exposure to
interest rate risk in the event of a catastrophic increase in interest rates.
many securities held in the company's equity and other investments portfolio are
subject to price risk. the company uses options to hedge its price risk on
certain highly volatile equity securities.
the company uses a value-at-risk (var) model to estimate and quantify its market
risks.  the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value,
but is used as a risk estimation and management tool.  assumptions applied to
the var model at june 30, 2000 and june 30, 2001 include the following: normal
market conditions; monte carlo modeling with 10,000 simulated market price
paths; a 97.5% confidence interval; and a 20-day estimated loss in fair value
for each market risk category.  accordingly, 97.5% of the time the estimated 20-
day loss in fair value would be nominal for foreign currency denominated
investments and accounts receivable at june 30, 2000 and june 30, 2001, and
would not exceed $211 million and $363 million at june 30, 2000 and june 30,
2001 for interest-sensitive investments or $1.02 billion and $520 million at
june 30, 2000 and june 30, 2001 for equity securities.

notes to financial statements
accounting policies
accounting principles
the financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with
generally accepted accounting principles in the united states.
principles of consolidation
the financial statements include the accounts of microsoft and its subsidiaries.
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated.  equity investments
in which microsoft owns at least 20% of the voting securities are accounted for
using the equity method, except for investments in which the company is not able
to exercise significant influence over the investee, in which case, the cost
method of accounting is used.  issuances of shares by a subsidiary are accounted
for as capital transactions.
estimates and assumptions
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
and expenses.  examples include provisions for returns, concessions and bad
debts; and the length of product life cycles and buildings' lives.  actual
results may differ from these estimates.
foreign currencies
assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the
exchange rate on the balance sheet date.  translation adjustments resulting from
this process are charged or credited to other comprehensive income.  revenue and
expenses are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the year.
revenue recognition
revenue from products licensed to original equipment manufacturers is recorded
when oems ship licensed products while revenue from certain license programs is
recorded when the software has been delivered and the customer is invoiced.
revenue from packaged product sales to and through distributors and resellers is
recorded when related products are shipped.  maintenance and subscription
revenue is recognized ratably over the contract period.  revenue attributable to
undelivered elements, including technical support and internet browser
technologies, is based on the average sales price of those elements and is
recognized ratably on a straight-line basis over the product's life cycle.  when
the revenue recognition criteria required for distributor and reseller
arrangements are not met, revenue is recognized as payments are received.  costs
related to insignificant obligations, which include telephone support for
certain products, are accrued.  provisions are recorded for returns,
concessions, and bad debts.
cost of revenue
cost of revenue includes direct costs to produce and distribute product and
direct costs to provide online services, consulting, product support, and
training and certification of system integrators.
research and development
research and development costs are expensed as incurred.  statement of financial
accounting standards (sfas) 86, accounting for the costs of computer software to
be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed, does not materially affect the company.
advertising costs
advertising costs are expensed as incurred.  advertising expense was $804
million in 1999, $1.23 billion in 2000, and $1.36 billion in 2001.
income taxes
income tax expense includes u.s. and international income taxes, plus the
provision for u.s. taxes on undistributed earnings of international
subsidiaries.  certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax
returns and financial statements in the same year.  the tax effect of this
difference is reported as deferred income taxes.
financial instruments
the company considers all liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of
three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents.  short-term
investments generally mature between three months and six years from the
purchase date.  all cash and short-term investments are classified as available
for sale and are recorded at market value using the specific identification
method; unrealized gains and losses are reflected in other comprehensive income
(oci).
equity and other investments include debt and equity instruments.  debt
securities and publicly traded equity securities are classified as available for
sale and are recorded at market using the specific identification method.
unrealized gains and losses (excluding other-than-temporary losses) are
reflected in other comprehensive income.  all other investments, excluding those
accounted for using the equity method, are recorded at cost.
microsoft lends certain fixed income and equity securities to enhance investment
income.  collateral and/or security interest is determined based upon the
underlying security and the creditworthiness of the borrower.  the fair value of
collateral that microsoft is permitted to sell or repledge was $499 million at
june 30, 2001.  there was no collateral that microsoft was permitted to sell or
repledge at june 30, 2000.
investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged
to be other-than-temporary.  the company employs a systematic methodology that
considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its
investments.  in the event that the cost of an investment exceeds its fair
value, the company evaluates, among other factors, the duration and extent to
which the fair value is less than cost; the financial health of and business
outlook for the investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in
technology, and operational and financing cash flow factors; and the company's
intent and ability to hold the investment.  once a decline in fair value is
determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded and a
new cost basis in the investment is established.  in 2001, the company
recognized $4.80 billion in impairments of certain investments, primarily in the
cable and telecommunication industries.
the company uses derivative instruments to manage exposures to foreign currency,
security price, and interest rate risks.  the company's objectives for holding
derivatives are to minimize these risks using the most effective methods to
eliminate or reduce the impact of these exposures.
foreign currency risk
---------------------
certain forecasted transactions and assets are exposed to foreign currency risk.
the company monitors its foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the
overall effectiveness of its foreign currency hedge positions.  principal
currencies hedged include the euro, japanese yen, british pound, and canadian
dollar.  options used to hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for
up to three years in the future are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.
options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments under sfas 133 are
also used to hedge the impact of the variability in exchange rates on accounts
receivable and collections denominated in certain foreign currencies.
securities price risk
---------------------
strategic equity investments are subject to market price risk.  from time to
time, the company uses and designates options to hedge fair values and cash
flows on certain equity securities.  the security, or forecasted sale thereof,
selected for hedging is determined by market conditions, up-front costs, and
other relevant factors.  once established, the hedges are not dynamically
managed or traded, and are generally not removed until maturity.
interest rate risk
------------------
fixed-income securities are subject to interest rate risk.  the fixed-income
portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment grade securities
to minimize credit risk.  the company routinely uses options, not designated as
hedging instruments, to hedge its exposure to interest rate risk in the event of
a catastrophic increase in interest rates.
other derivatives
-----------------
in addition, the company may invest in warrants to purchase securities of other
companies as a strategic investment.  warrants that can be net share settled are
deemed derivative financial instruments and are not designated as hedging
instruments.
for options designated either as fair value or cash flow hedges, changes in the
time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness.
property and equipment
property and equipment is stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line
method over the shorter of the estimated life of the asset or the lease term,
ranging from one to 15 years.  computer software developed or obtained for
internal use is depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of
the estimated life of the software or three years.
intangible assets
goodwill and other intangible assets are amortized using the straight-line
method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from three to seven
years.  the company periodically evaluates the recoverability of intangible
assets and takes into account events or circumstances that warrant revised
estimates of useful lives or that indicate that an impairment exists.
in june 2001, the financial accounting standards board issued statement of
financial accounting standards (sfas) 141, business combinations, and sfas 142,
goodwill and other intangible assets.  sfas 141 requires business combinations
initiated after june 30, 2001 to be accounted for using the purchase method of
accounting.  it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are
required to be recognized and reported separately from goodwill.  sfas 142 will
require that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized, but
instead tested for impairment at least annually.  sfas 142 is required to be
applied starting with fiscal years beginning after december 15, 2001, with early
application permitted in certain circumstances.  the company plans to early
adopt sfas 142 in fiscal 2002 and does not expect any impairment of goodwill
upon adoption.  goodwill amortization was approximately $300 million in fiscal
2001 and approximately $225 million in fiscal 2000.
reclassifications
certain reclassifications have been made for consistent presentation.
accounting change
effective july 1, 2000, the company adopted sfas 133, accounting for derivative
instruments and hedging activities, which establishes accounting and reporting
standards for derivative instruments, including certain derivative instruments
embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities.  all derivatives,
whether designated in hedging relationships or not, are required to be recorded
on the balance sheet at fair value.  if the derivative is designated as a fair
value hedge, the changes in the fair value of the derivative and of the hedged
item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in earnings.  if the
derivative is designated as a cash flow hedge, the effective portions of changes
in the fair value of the derivative are recorded in other comprehensive income
and are recognized in the income statement when the hedged item affects
earnings.  ineffective portions of changes in the fair value of cash flow hedges
are recognized in earnings.
the adoption of sfas 133 on july 1, 2000, resulted in a cumulative pre-tax
reduction to income of $560 million ($375 million after-tax) and a cumulative
pre-tax reduction to oci of $112 million ($75 million after-tax).  the reduction
to income was mostly attributable to a loss of approximately $300 million
reclassified from oci for the time value of options and a loss of approximately
$250 million reclassified from oci for derivatives not designated as hedging
instruments.  the reduction to oci was mostly attributable to losses of
approximately $670 million on cash flow hedges offset by reclassifications out
of oci of the approximately $300 million loss for the time value of options and
the approximately $250 million loss for derivative instruments not designated as
hedging instruments.  the net derivative losses included in oci as of july 1,
2000 were reclassified into earnings during the twelve months ended june 30,
2001.
the change in accounting from the adoption of sfas 133 did not materially affect
net income in 2001.
unearned revenue
a portion of microsoft's revenue is earned ratably over the product life cycle
or, in the case of subscriptions, over the period of the license agreement.
end users receive certain elements of the company's products over a period of
time.  these elements include items such as browser technologies and technical
support.  consequently, microsoft's earned revenue reflects the recognition of
the fair value of these elements over the product's life cycle.  upon adoption
of american institute of certified public accountants (aicpa) statement of
position (sop) 98-9, modification of sop 97-2, with respect to
certain transactions, during the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, the company was
required to change the methodology of attributing the fair value to undelivered
elements. the percentages of undelivered elements in relation to the total
arrangement decreased, reducing the amount of windows and office revenue treated
as unearned, and increasing the amount of revenue recognized upon shipment. the
percentage of revenue recognized ratably decreased from a range of 20% to 35% to
a range of approximately 15% to 25% of windows desktop operating systems. for
desktop applications, the percentage decreased from approximately 20% to a range
of approximately 10% to 20%. the ranges depend on the terms and conditions of
the license and prices of the elements. in addition, in the fourth quarter of
fiscal 1999, the company extended the life cycle of windows from two to three
years based upon management's review of product shipment cycles. product life
cycles are currently estimated at 18 months for desktop applications. the
company also sells subscriptions to certain products via maintenance and certain
organizational license agreements.
at june 30, 2000 and 2001, desktop applications unearned revenue was $1.84
billion and $2.19 billion.  desktop platforms unearned revenue was $2.34 billion
and $2.59 billion.  enterprise software and services unearned revenue was $433
million and $413 million.  unearned revenue associated with consumer software,
services, and devices, and other was $200 million and $427 million at june 30,
2000 and 2001.

debt securities include corporate and government notes and bonds and derivative
securities.  debt securities maturing beyond 15 years are composed entirely of
at&t; 5% convertible preferred debt with a contractual maturity of 30 years.  the
debt is convertible into at&t; common stock on or after december 1, 2000, or may
be redeemed by at&t; upon satisfaction of certain conditions on or after june 1,
2002.  equity securities that are restricted for more than one year or not
publicly traded are recorded at cost.  at june 30, 2000 and 2001, the estimated
fair value of these investments in excess of their recorded basis was $2.70
billion and $161 million, based on publicly available market information or
other estimates determined by management.  realized gains and (losses) from
equity and other investments (excluding impairments discussed previously) were
$786 million and $(2) million in 1999, $1.94 billion and $(10) million in 2000,
and $3.03 billion and $(23) million in 2001.
derivatives
for the twelve months ended june 30, 2001, investment income included a net
unrealized loss of $592 million, comprised of a $214 million gain for changes in
the time value of options for fair value hedges, $211 million loss for changes
in the time value of options for cash flow hedges, and $595 million loss for
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments not designated as hedging
instruments.
derivative gains and losses included in oci are reclassified into earnings at
the time forecasted revenue or the sale of an equity investment is recognized.
during the twelve months ended june 30, 2001, $214 million of derivative gains
were reclassified to revenue and $416 million of derivative losses were
reclassified to investment income/(loss).  the derivative losses reclassified to
investment income/(loss) were offset by gains on the item being hedged.  the
company estimates that $144 million of net derivative gains included in other
comprehensive income will be reclassified into earnings within the next twelve
months.
for instruments designated as hedges, hedge ineffectiveness, determined in
accordance with sfas 133, had no impact on earnings for the twelve months ended
june 30, 2001.  no fair value hedges or cash flow hedges were derecognized or
discontinued for the twelve months ended june 30, 2001.

repurchase program
the company repurchases its common shares in the open market to provide shares
for issuance to employees under stock option and stock purchase plans.  during
1998, the company executed two forward settlement structured repurchase
agreements with an independent third party totaling 42 million shares of stock
and paid cash for a portion of the purchase price.  in 1999, the company settled
the agreements by returning 28 million shares of stock, based upon the stock
price on the date of settlement.  the timing and method of settlement were at
the discretion of the company.  the differential between the cash paid and the
price of microsoft common stock on the date of the agreement was originally
reflected in common stock and paid-in capital.  in 2001, the company entered
into a structured stock repurchase transaction giving it the right to acquire
5.1 million of its shares (2.55 million shares in october 2001 and 2.55 million
shares in june 2002) in exchange for an up-front net payment of $264 million.
put warrants
to enhance its stock repurchase program, microsoft sold put warrants to
independent third parties.  these put warrants entitled the holders to sell
shares of microsoft common stock to the company on certain dates at specified
prices.  in the third quarter of fiscal 2001, the company issued 2.8 million
shares to settle a portion of the outstanding put warrants.  during fiscal 2001,
all the remaining outstanding put warrants were either retired or exercised.

the company follows accounting principles board opinion 25, accounting for stock
issued to employees, to account for stock option and employee stock purchase
plans.  an alternative method of accounting for stock options is sfas 123,
accounting for stock-based compensation.  under sfas 123, employee stock options
are valued at grant date using the black-scholes valuation model, and this
compensation cost is recognized ratably over the vesting period.  had
compensation cost for the company's stock option and employee stock purchase

earnings per share
basic earnings per share is computed on the basis of the weighted average number
of common shares outstanding.  diluted earnings per share is computed on the
basis of the weighted average number of common shares outstanding plus the
effect of outstanding preferred shares using the "if-converted" method, assumed
net-share settlement of common stock structured repurchases, outstanding put
warrants using the "reverse treasury stock" method, and outstanding stock
options using the "treasury stock" method.

operational transactions
in november 1998, microsoft acquired linkexchange, inc., a leading provider of
online marketing services to web site owners and small- and medium-sized
businesses.  microsoft paid $265 million in stock.
in november 1999, expedia, inc. completed an initial public offering of its
common stock.  expedia, which is majority-owned by microsoft, is a leading
provider of branded online travel services for leisure and small business
travelers.  expedia's financial results and financial condition are consolidated
with the operations of microsoft.
in january 2000, the company merged with visio corporation in a transaction that
was accounted for as a pooling of interests.  microsoft issued 14 million shares
in the exchange for the outstanding stock of visio.  visio's assets and
liabilities, which were nominal, are included with those of microsoft as of the
merger.  operating results for visio from periods prior to the merger were not
material to the combined results of the two companies.  accordingly, the
financial statements for such periods have not been restated.
in july 2000, the company acquired an interest in telewest communications plc
for approximately $2.6 billion in stock.  telewest is a leading broadband cable
communications operator in the united kingdom.
in april 2001, the company acquired great plains software, inc. for
approximately $1.1 billion in stock.  great plains is a leading supplier of mid-
market business applications.  the acquisition was accounted for by the purchase
method and operating results for great plains subsequent to the date of
acquisition are included with those of microsoft.  the pro forma impact of great
plains' operating results prior to the date of acquisition was not material.
commitments
the company has operating leases for most u.s. and international sales and
support offices and certain equipment.  rental expense for operating leases was
$135 million, $201 million, and $281 million in 1999, 2000, and 2001.  future
minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases, in millions of dollars,
are: 2002, $218; 2003, $210; 2004, $185; 2005, $162; 2006, $140; and thereafter,
$430.  microsoft has committed $181 million for constructing new buildings and
$46 million for the manufacturing of products.  in addition, the company has
guaranteed $420 million in debt of its equity investees.
contingencies
on january 23, 2001, microsoft and sun microsystems, inc. ("sun") entered into a
settlement agreement.  under the terms of the public agreement, the parties
agreed to a dismissal with prejudice of all pending claims in the suit brought
by sun against microsoft on october 7, 1997 in the u.s. district court for the
northern district of california.  sun also granted to microsoft a non-exclusive
license to continue distribution of certain sun technology for a seven year
period.  microsoft further agreed to pay sun $20 million.
the company is a defendant in u.s. v. microsoft, a lawsuit filed by the
antitrust division of the u.s. department of justice (doj) and a group of
eighteen state attorneys general alleging violations of the sherman act and
various state antitrust laws.  after the trial, the district court entered
findings of fact and conclusions of law stating that microsoft had violated
sections 1 and 2 of the sherman act and various state antitrust laws.  a
judgment was entered on june 7, 2000 ordering, among other things, the breakup
of microsoft into two companies.  the judgment was stayed pending an appeal.  on
june 28, 2001, the u.s. court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit
affirmed in part, reversed in part, and vacated the judgment in its entirety and
remanded the case to the district court for a new trial on one section 1 claim
and for entry of a new judgment consistent with its ruling.  in its ruling, the
court of appeals substantially narrowed the bases of liability found by the
district court, but affirmed some of the district court's conclusions that
microsoft had violated section 2.  on september 6, 2001, the plaintiffs
announced that on remand they will not ask the court to break microsoft up, that
they will seek imposition of conduct remedies, and that they will not retry the
one section 1 claim returned to the district court by the court of appeals.  on
august 7, 2001, microsoft petitioned the supreme court for a writ of certiorari
to review the appellate court's ruling concerning its disqualification of the
district court judge.  microsoft may petition the supreme court to review other
aspects of the appellate court's decision after final judgment is entered.
in other ongoing investigations, the doj and several state attorneys general
have requested information from microsoft concerning various issues. in
addition, the european commission has instituted proceedings in which it alleges
that microsoft has failed to disclose information that microsoft competitors
claim they need to interoperate fully with windows 2000 clients and servers and
has engaged in discriminatory licensing of such technology. the remedies sought,
though not fully defined, include mandatory disclosure of microsoft windows
operating system technology and imposition of fines. microsoft denies the
european commission's allegations and intends to contest the proceedings
vigorously.
a large number of overcharge class action lawsuits have been initiated against
microsoft.  these cases allege that microsoft has competed unfairly and
unlawfully monopolized alleged markets for operating systems and certain
software applications and seek to recover alleged overcharges that the
complaints contend microsoft charged for these products.  microsoft believes the
claims are without merit and is vigorously defending the cases.  to date,
microsoft has won dismissals of all claims for damages by indirect purchasers
under federal law and in 15 separate state court proceedings.  claims on behalf
of foreign purchasers have also been dismissed.  plaintiffs have appealed most
of these rulings.  while no trials or other proceedings have been held
concerning any liability issues, courts in several states have ruled that these
cases may proceed as class actions, while one court has denied class
certification status to the claims in that state proceeding.
two purported class action employment discrimination cases are pending against
microsoft, donaldson v. microsoft, a class case consolidating three separately
filed class action complaints filed in october 2000 and february 2001 in federal
court in seattle, washington, and jackson v. microsoft, an amendment to an
existing case alleging class claims filed on january 3, 2001 in federal court in
washington, d.c.  microsoft's motion to transfer the jackson case to federal
court in seattle was granted on may 3, 2001.  the donaldson plaintiffs purport
to represent a nationwide class of current and former african american and
female microsoft employees and seek injunctive relief, an unspecified amount of
compensatory and punitive damages, and attorneys' fees.  the jackson plaintiffs
purport to represent a nationwide class of current and former african american
microsoft employees and seeks injunctive relief, $5 billion in compensatory and
punitive damages, and attorneys' fees.  both cases allege that microsoft's
compensation, evaluation, and promotion policies are discriminatory with respect
to the plaintiffs in violation of title vii of the 1964 civil rights act and 42
u.s.c. (s) 1981.  microsoft denies the allegations and is vigorously defending
both cases.
the securities and exchange commission is conducting a non-public investigation
into the company's accounting reserve practices.  microsoft is also subject to
various legal proceedings and claims that arise in the ordinary course of
business.
management currently believes that resolving these matters will not have a
material adverse impact on the company's financial position or its results of
operations.

in 2001, microsoft changed the composition of its segments to reflect the
internal reorganization around microsoft .net, the company's vision for the
next-generation of internet-based products and services.  except for 1999
operating income/(loss), prior year disclosures have been restated for
consistent presentation.  it is not practicable to discern operating income for
1999 for the current segments due to previous internal reorganizations.
microsoft has four segments:  desktop and enterprise software and services;
consumer software, services, and devices; consumer commerce investments; and
other.  desktop and enterprise software and services operating segment includes
desktop applications, desktop platforms, and enterprise software and services.
desktop applications include microsoft office; project; visio; client access
licenses for windows 2000 server, windows nt server, exchange, and backoffice;
microsoft great plains; and bcentral.  desktop platforms include windows 2000
professional, windows nt workstation, windows millennium edition (windows me),
windows 98, and other desktop operating systems.  enterprise software and
services includes windows nt server and windows 2000 server operating systems,
sql server and client access licenses, exchange server, developer tools,
consulting services, product support services, and training and certification.
consumer software, services, and devices operating segment includes msn internet
access, msn network services, webtv internet access and services, gaming,
learning and productivity software, mobile and wireless devices, and embedded
systems.  consumer commerce investments operating segment includes expedia,
inc., the homeadvisor online real estate service, and the carpoint online
automotive service.  other includes hardware and press.
segment information is presented in accordance with sfas 131, disclosures about
segments of an enterprise and related information.  this standard is based on a
management approach, which requires segmentation based upon the company's
internal organization and disclosure of revenue and operating income based upon
internal accounting methods.  the company's financial reporting systems present
various data for management to run the business, including internal profit and
loss statements (p&ls;) prepared on a basis not consistent with generally
accepted accounting principles.  assets are not allocated to segments for
internal reporting purposes.
reconciling items for revenue include certain elements of unearned revenue and
the treatment of certain channel inventory amounts and estimates.  in addition
to the reconciling items for revenue, reconciling items for operating
income/(loss) include general and administrative expenses ($1,050 million in
2000 and $857 million in 2001), certain research expenses ($141 million in 2000
and $154 million in 2001), and other corporate level adjustments.  the internal
p&ls; use accelerated methods of depreciation and amortization.  additionally,
losses on equity investees and minority interest are classified in operating
income for internal reporting presentations.
revenue attributable to u.s. operations includes shipments to customers in the
united states, licensing to oems and certain multinational organizations, and
exports of finished goods, primarily to asia, latin america, and canada.

responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on

perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial

significant estimates made by management, as well as evaluating the overall
financial statement presentation.  we believe that our audits provide a
reasonable basis for our opinion.
in our opinion, such consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all
material respects, the financial position of microsoft corporation and
subsidiaries as of june 30, 2000 and 2001, and the results of their operations
and their cash flows for each of the three years in the period ended june 30,
